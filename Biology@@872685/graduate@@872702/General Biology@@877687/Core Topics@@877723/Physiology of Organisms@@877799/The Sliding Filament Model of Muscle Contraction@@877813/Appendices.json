Understanding the precise molecular trigger for this event is fundamental to grasping the sliding filament model. This first exercise [@problem_id:1753023] presents a hypothetical scenario involving a drug that blocks the release of inorganic phosphate ($P_i$), allowing you to deduce the critical role of this step in initiating force generation and arresting the cross-bridge cycle in a specific, pre-power stroke state.", "problem": "In the field of muscle physiology, researchers are investigating a novel drug intended to modulate muscle contraction. The drug's mechanism of action is highly specific: it allows the myosin head to hydrolyze Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and bind to the actin filament, but it potently inhibits the subsequent release of the inorganic phosphate ($P_i$) group from the myosin head. All other cellular processes, including calcium ion ($Ca^{2+}$) signaling and the availability of ATP and Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP), are assumed to remain normal.\n\nBased on the established sliding filament model of muscle contraction, what is the most direct and immediate consequence for the cross-bridge cycle in a muscle fiber exposed to this drug?\n\nA. The myosin head will be unable to bind to the actin filament to form a cross-bridge.\n\nB. Myosin heads will bind to actin, but will be arrested in a \"cocked,\" high-energy state, unable to perform the power stroke.\n\nC. The muscle fiber will enter a state of extreme rigidity, similar to rigor mortis, because the myosin heads cannot detach from actin.\n\nD. The hydrolysis of ATP into ADP and $P_i$ by the myosin head will be prevented.\n\nE. Calcium ions will be blocked from binding to troponin, thus preventing the exposure of myosin-binding sites on actin.", "solution": "We analyze the cross-bridge cycle using the sliding filament model, denoting myosin by $M$, actin by $A$, adenosine triphosphate by $\\text{ATP}$, adenosine diphosphate by $\\text{ADP}$, and inorganic phosphate by $P_{i}$. The canonical sequence of states and transitions can be written symbolically as follows, with conformational states indicated by superscripts when helpful.\n\n1) Detachment upon ATP binding (from a strongly bound rigor state):\n$$\nA\\cdot M + \\text{ATP} \\to M\\cdot \\text{ATP} + A\n$$\n\n2) ATP hydrolysis and cocking of the myosin head (high-energy conformation):\n$$\nM\\cdot \\text{ATP} \\to M^{*}\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{i}\n$$\nHere, $M^{*}$ denotes the cocked, high-energy conformation.\n\n3) Weak binding of the cocked myosin head to actin:\n$$\nM^{*}\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{i} + A \\rightleftharpoons A\\cdot M^{*}\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{i}\n$$\nThis state is a weak, pre-power-stroke cross-bridge.\n\n4) Release of $P_{i}$ triggers the power stroke and transition to a strong-binding, force-generating state:\n$$\nA\\cdot M^{*}\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{i} \\xrightarrow{\\text{release of } P_{i}} A\\cdot M^{\\dagger}\\cdot \\text{ADP} + P_{i}\n$$\nHere, $M^{\\dagger}$ represents the post-stroke, strong-binding conformation.\n\n5) ADP release stabilizes the strongly bound rigor-like state:\n$$\nA\\cdot M^{\\dagger}\\cdot \\text{ADP} \\to A\\cdot M\n$$\n\n6) ATP binding to the rigor state causes detachment, closing the cycle:\n$$\nA\\cdot M + \\text{ATP} \\to M\\cdot \\text{ATP} + A\n$$\n\nAccording to the problem, the drug allows ATP hydrolysis and actin binding but potently inhibits the release of $P_{i}$. Translating this into the scheme above:\n\n- Step 2 is permitted: $M\\cdot \\text{ATP} \\to M^{*}\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{i}$.\n- Step 3 is permitted: $M^{*}\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{i}$ can bind actin weakly to form $A\\cdot M^{*}\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{i}$.\n- Step 4 is specifically blocked: the release of $P_{i}$ from $A\\cdot M^{*}\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{i}$ cannot occur, so the power stroke and transition to strong binding cannot proceed.\n\nTherefore, the cross-bridge accumulates in the pre-power-stroke, cocked, high-energy state $A\\cdot M^{*}\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{i}$ and is unable to execute the power stroke. This directly rules out options that contradict the given permissions:\n\n- Option A is incorrect because actin binding is allowed (Step 3 proceeds).\n- Option D is incorrect because ATP hydrolysis is allowed (Step 2 proceeds).\n- Option E is incorrect because $Ca^{2+}$ signaling and troponin binding are normal, so thin filament activation is unaffected.\n- Option C is incorrect because rigor-like rigidity requires strong, nucleotide-free binding ($A\\cdot M$) with failure of detachment due to absent ATP. Here, the block is upstream at $P_{i}$ release; the system does not reach the strong-binding state that causes rigor. Moreover, the $A\\cdot M^{*}\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{i}$ complex is a weakly bound, pre-power-stroke state.\n\nThe most direct and immediate consequence is that myosin heads bind to actin but are arrested in the cocked, high-energy, pre-power-stroke state because $P_{i}$ release—the trigger for the power stroke—is inhibited.

This next practice [@problem_id:1753034] explores the essential role of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) in this process.

This muscle fiber has an adequate supply of calcium ions available in the sarcoplasm. Myoblockin is a molecule structurally analogous to Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and acts as a competitive inhibitor by binding to the ATP-binding site on the myosin head. A key characteristic of Myoblockin is that it cannot be hydrolyzed by the myosin ATPase.\n\nGiven this information, which of the following outcomes is the most direct and immediate consequence of introducing Myoblockin to the active muscle fiber?\n\nA. Myosin heads will remain permanently attached to the actin filaments in a \"rigor\" state, causing the muscle to become stiff and inextensible.\n\nB. Myosin heads will detach from the actin filaments but will be unable to re-bind to form new cross-bridges, leading to muscle relaxation.\n\nC. Myosin heads will hydrolyze the Myoblockin, leading to a single, forceful, and irreversible power stroke that damages the sarcomere.\n\nD. The binding of Myoblockin will trigger a massive release of additional calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to hyper-contraction.\n\nE. The power stroke will occur, but the myosin heads will be unable to detach from the actin filaments afterward, arresting the cycle after force generation.", "solution": "The cross-bridge cycle in skeletal muscle proceeds through defined nucleotide-dependent states:\n1) In the absence of nucleotide, myosin binds actin strongly (rigor state).\n2) Binding of ATP to the myosin head produces a conformational change that greatly reduces affinity for actin, causing detachment.\n3) Hydrolysis of ATP to $\\text{ADP} + \\text{P}_{\\text{i}}$ cocks the myosin head into a high-energy state; with $\\text{ADP} + \\text{P}_{\\text{i}}$ bound, myosin can form a weak actin attachment.\n4) Release of $\\text{P}_{\\text{i}}$ upon strong actin binding triggers the power stroke.\n5) Release of $\\text{ADP}$ leaves myosin in a strongly bound, post-stroke state until a new ATP binds to induce detachment.\n\nIn the experimental setup, calcium is adequately available in the sarcoplasm, so regulatory sites on actin are exposed and cross-bridge cycling would proceed if ATP could bind and be hydrolyzed. Myoblockin is structurally analogous to ATP, binds competitively at the ATP-binding site on myosin, but cannot be hydrolyzed by myosin ATPase.\n\nThe immediate mechanistic consequences are:\n- When Myoblockin binds to the ATP site on myosin, it mimics the ATP-bound state regarding actin affinity, which is low; thus, binding of Myoblockin promotes detachment of myosin from actin (analogous to ATP-induced dissociation).\n- Because Myoblockin cannot be hydrolyzed, the transition to the $\\text{ADP} + \\text{P}_{\\text{i}}$-bound, cocked state cannot occur. Without hydrolysis, myosin heads cannot re-cock and cannot proceed to the strong-binding state required for a power stroke.\n- With ATP sites occupied by a nonhydrolyzable analog, myosin heads remain in an ATP-like, detached state and are unable to form new productive cross-bridges.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate outcome is detachment of myosin heads with failure to re-bind and cycle, leading to relaxation.\n\nThis rules out:\n- A and E, which require failure of ATP-site occupancy for detachment (rigor-like states), contrary to Myoblockin binding.\n- C, because Myoblockin is explicitly nonhydrolyzable, so no power stroke would be driven by its hydrolysis.\n- D, because Myoblockin targets myosin ATP binding, not sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release.\n\nThe correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1753034"}, {"introduction": "Individual molecular events, when summed over millions of cross-bridges, give rise to macroscopic muscle force.
