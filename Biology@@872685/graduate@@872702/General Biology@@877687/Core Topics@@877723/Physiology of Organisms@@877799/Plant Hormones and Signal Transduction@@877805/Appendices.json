This exercise challenges you to apply this logic to the classic ethylene signaling cascade.

In the absence of ethylene, wild-type seedlings elongate their hypocotyls. In the presence of ethylene, wild-type seedlings display the canonical triple response: reduced hypocotyl elongation, radial swelling, and an exaggerated apical hook. Three mutant genotypes are available: an ethylene receptor mutant etr$1$ that is dominant-insensitive to ethylene, a kinase mutant ctr$1$ that is a loss-of-function allele, and ein$2$ that is a null allele. The experimental question is to infer, from first principles of signal transduction and epistasis, both the expected phenotypes of single and double mutants under air versus ethylene and the order of gene action in the pathway.\n\nUse only the following foundational bases in your reasoning:\n- Hormone receptors can act as negative or positive regulators of downstream signaling depending on whether ligand binding activates or inactivates the receptor; the active state of a negative regulator suppresses downstream responses.\n- A loss-of-function in a negative regulator tends to derepress downstream signaling; a dominant hormone-insensitive receptor allele often reflects a receptor locked in a state that does not transmit the ligand-induced change in signaling state.\n- In epistasis for a linear pathway, if mutation in gene $X$ masks the phenotype of mutation in gene $Y$ in a double mutant, then $X$ is epistatic to and functionally downstream of $Y$ with respect to the assayed phenotype; a null in a positively acting downstream component will block the response regardless of upstream activation, whereas a null in a negatively acting component will permit downstream activation regardless of upstream repression.\n\nWhich option best predicts the phenotypes and genetic order, and correctly explains how each lesion affects signal flow?\n\nA. etr$1$ dominant-insensitive seedlings are ethylene-insensitive (elongated, not swollen, open hook) both in air and with ethylene, because the receptor is locked in its active, repressing state; ctr$1$ loss-of-function seedlings show constitutive ethylene responses (short, swollen, exaggerated hook) even in air, because removal of a negative regulator derepresses signaling; ein$2$ null seedlings are ethylene-insensitive in both conditions because a required positive conduit is missing. In double mutants, ctr$1$ is epistatic to etr$1$ (etr$1$;ctr$1$ shows constitutive response like ctr$1$), and ein$2$ is epistatic to ctr$1$ (ctr$1$;ein$2$ is insensitive like ein$2$). Therefore, the order is ETR$1$ —| CTR$1$ —| EIN$2$ — ethylene responses, and the lesions act as follows: etr$1$ locks repression “on,” ctr$1$ loss-of-function relieves repression, ein$2$ null removes the downstream positive signal.\n\nB. etr$1$ dominant-insensitive seedlings are constitutive for ethylene responses because the receptor cannot bind hormone and therefore signals as if ethylene were always present; ctr$1$ loss-of-function seedlings are ethylene-insensitive because a required positive kinase is missing; ein$2$ null seedlings show constitutive ethylene responses because loss of a repressor derepresses the output. In double mutants, etr$1$ is epistatic to ctr$1$ (etr$1$;ctr$1$ is constitutive), and ctr$1$ is epistatic to ein$2$ (ctr$1$;ein$2$ is insensitive). Therefore, the order is EIN$2$ —| CTR$1$ — ETR$1$ — responses, and the lesions act in the opposite manner to their wild-type roles.\n\nC. etr$1$ dominant-insensitive seedlings are indistinguishable from wild type in air but become hypersensitive to ethylene, because the mutation increases receptor affinity; ctr$1$ loss-of-function seedlings remain wild type in air and become hypersensitive to ethylene because a positive regulator is overactivated by hormone; ein$2$ null seedlings behave like wild type in both conditions because EIN$2$ is redundant. In double mutants, all combinations are wild type in air and hypersensitive with ethylene, indicating a branched, redundant pathway with no clear order.\n\nD. etr$1$ dominant-insensitive seedlings are ethylene-insensitive in both conditions due to failure to perceive ligand; ctr$1$ loss-of-function seedlings are ethylene-insensitive in both conditions because CTR$1$ is required to transmit the signal; ein$2$ null seedlings are constitutive for ethylene responses because an inhibitor has been removed. In double mutants, etr$1$ is epistatic to ctr$1$ (insensitive), and ctr$1$ is epistatic to ein$2$ (insensitive), placing CTR$1$ downstream of EIN$2$ as a positive regulator.\n\nSelect the single best option.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation prior to any attempt at a solution.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n-   **Biological System**: Dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings.\n-   **Wild-Type Phenotypes**:\n    -   In air (no ethylene): Elongated hypocotyls.\n    -   With ethylene: The canonical triple response (reduced hypocotyl elongation, radial swelling, and an exaggerated apical hook).\n-   **Mutant Alleles**:\n    -   `etr1`: An ethylene receptor mutant that is dominant-insensitive to ethylene.\n    -   `ctr1`: A kinase mutant that is a loss-of-function allele.\n    -   `ein2`: A null allele.\n-   **Objective**: To infer the phenotypes of single and double mutants and the order of gene action.\n-   **Governing Principles**:\n    1.  Hormone receptors can be negative or positive regulators. The active state of a negative regulator suppresses downstream responses.\n    2.  A loss-of-function in a negative regulator tends to derepress downstream signaling. A dominant hormone-insensitive receptor allele often reflects a receptor locked in a state that does not transmit the ligand-induced change.\n    3.  Epistasis for a linear pathway: If a mutation in gene $X$ masks the phenotype of a mutation in gene $Y$ in a double mutant, gene $X$ is epistatic to and functionally downstream of gene $Y$. A null allele in a positively acting component blocks the downstream response, while a null allele in a negatively acting component permits downstream activation.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated for validity.\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is based on the well-established and canonical ethylene signal transduction pathway in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. The genes *ETR1*, *CTR1*, and *EIN2* are central, well-characterized components of this pathway. The described phenotypes (triple response, insensitivity, constitutive response) are standard in the field of plant biology. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides a clear genetic system, defined mutations, and a set of logical principles (epistasis) to derive a solution. The question is specific and answerable with the information provided. A unique and stable solution (the genetic pathway) exists.\n-   **Objectivity**: The language is precise and devoid of subjective or ambiguous terminology. Terms such as \"dominant-insensitive,\" \"loss-of-function,\" and \"null allele\" have clear, established meanings in genetics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. The setup is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. A solution will now be derived based on the provided principles.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe objective is to deduce the phenotypes and the genetic pathway order from first principles.\n\n1.  **Analyze Wild-Type Signaling**: In the absence of ethylene, the plant exhibits a default growth pattern (elongated hypocotyl), which represents the \"OFF\" state of the ethylene response pathway. The presence of ethylene induces the triple response, which is the \"ON\" state. Therefore, ethylene acts as a positive trigger for the response pathway.\n\n2.  **Analyze Single Mutant Phenotypes**:\n    -   **`etr1` (dominant-insensitive)**: The term \"insensitive\" signifies that the mutant does not respond to ethylene. Thus, its phenotype is the \"OFF\" state (elongated hypocotyl) regardless of the presence of ethylene. The principle states that a dominant-insensitive allele reflects a receptor \"locked in a state that does not transmit the ligand-induced change.\" Since the wild-type receptor turns the pathway \"ON\" upon binding ethylene, its state in the *absence* of ethylene must be one that keeps the pathway \"OFF\". The `etr1` mutant is locked in this repressive state. This implies that the *ETR1* receptor is a **negative regulator** of the ethylene response. In its default state (no ethylene), it is active and suppresses the pathway. Ethylene binding normally inactivates this suppression. The `etr1` mutation creates a protein that cannot be inactivated by ethylene, thus permanently suppressing the pathway.\n\n    -   **`ctr1` (loss-of-function)**: We must determine if *CTR1* is a positive or negative regulator.\n        -   If *CTR1* were a positive regulator, its loss-of-function would block the pathway, resulting in an ethylene-insensitive phenotype (always \"OFF\").\n        -   If *CTR1* were a negative regulator, its loss-of-function would lead to constitutive activation of the pathway, as the repression is removed. This is known as \"derepression\" and would result in a triple response phenotype even in the absence of ethylene (always \"ON\"). Let us hypothesize *CTR1* is a negative regulator and test this with epistasis.\n\n    -   **`ein2` (null allele)**: We must determine if *EIN2* is a positive or negative regulator.\n        -   If *EIN2* were a negative regulator, its loss would result in a constitutive response (always \"ON\").\n        -   If *EIN2* were a positive regulator, its loss would block the pathway, resulting in an ethylene-insensitive phenotype (always \"OFF\"). The principle states that a \"null in a positively acting downstream component will block the response\". Let us hypothesize *EIN2* is a positive regulator.\n\n3.  **Deduce Gene Order with Epistasis**:\n    -   **`etr1;ctr1` double mutant**: The `etr1` mutation results in an \"OFF\" signal (constitutive repression). The `ctr1` loss-of-function mutation, if *CTR1* is a negative regulator, results in an \"ON\" signal (constitutive activation). In a double mutant, if *CTR1* acts downstream of *ETR1*, the state of *CTR1* will determine the phenotype. The constitutive repression from the `etr1` allele is aimed at *CTR1*. If *CTR1* is absent (due to the loss-of-function mutation), it cannot be repressed, and the pathway proceeds as if *CTR1*'s inhibitory function is gone. The outcome is a constitutive \"ON\" phenotype, identical to the `ctr1` single mutant. This means the `ctr1` mutation is epistatic to the `etr1` mutation, placing ***CTR1* downstream of *ETR1***. This confirms our hypothesis that *CTR1* is a negative regulator.\n\n    -   **`ctr1;ein2` double mutant**: The `ctr1` mutation results in a constitutive \"ON\" signal. The `ein2` null allele, if *EIN2* is a positive regulator, results in a permanent \"OFF\" state because a necessary component is missing. In the double mutant, the constitutive \"ON\" signal generated upstream by the absence of *CTR1* function cannot be transmitted to the final response because the downstream component *EIN2* is absent. The signal is blocked. The resulting phenotype will be insensitive (\"OFF\"), identical to the `ein2` single mutant. This means the `ein2` mutation is epistatic to the `ctr1` mutation, placing ***EIN2* downstream of *CTR1***. This confirms our hypothesis that *EIN2* is a positive regulator.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Pathway**:\n    -   The order of action is *ETR1* -> *CTR1* -> *EIN2*.\n    -   The regulatory roles are: *ETR1* is a negative regulator, *CTR1* is a negative regulator, and *EIN2* is a positive regulator.\n    -   The functional genetic pathway can be represented as: *ETR1* —| *CTR1* —| *EIN2* — Ethylene responses.\n    -   **Signal flow (no ethylene)**: *ETR1* is active -> it activates *CTR1* -> active *CTR1* inhibits *EIN2* -> pathway is \"OFF\".\n    -   **Signal flow (with ethylene)**: Ethylene binds and inactivates *ETR1* -> *CTR1* becomes inactive -> inhibition of *EIN2* is relieved -> active *EIN2* promotes ethylene responses -> pathway is \"ON\".\n    -   **Lesions**:\n        -   `etr1` (dominant-insensitive): *ETR1* is locked in its active state, so *CTR1* is always active, *EIN2* is always inhibited, and the pathway is always \"OFF\".\n        -   `ctr1` (loss-of-function): *CTR1* is absent/non-functional. Its inhibitory effect on *EIN2* is permanently gone. *EIN2* is constitutively active, and the pathway is always \"ON\".\n        -   `ein2` (null): *EIN2* is absent/non-functional. The signal cannot be propagated to the final responses, regardless of the state of upstream components. The pathway is always \"OFF\".\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A.**: This option correctly identifies the phenotypes for all three single mutants: `etr1` is insensitive, `ctr1` is constitutive, and `ein2` is insensitive. It correctly describes the mechanism for each: `etr1` locks repression on, `ctr1` loss-of-function relieves repression, and `ein2` null removes a positive signal. It correctly predicts the epistasis results: `ctr1` is epistatic to `etr1`, and `ein2` is epistatic to `ctr1`. Finally, it presents the correct functional pathway order: *ETR1* —| *CTR1* —| *EIN2* — ethylene responses. Every statement in this option aligns with our derivation from first principles. **Correct**.\n\n-   **B.**: This option incorrectly states that `etr1` mutants are constitutive. They are defined in the problem as insensitive. It incorrectly identifies *CTR1* as a positive regulator and *EIN2* as a negative regulator. The predicted phenotypes and gene roles are fundamentally wrong. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **C.**: This option incorrectly claims that `etr1` and `ctr1` mutants are \"hypersensitive\" to ethylene. Hypersensitivity is the opposite of insensitivity, and `ctr1` is constitutive, not hypersensitive. It incorrectly claims *EIN2* is redundant, whereas it is essential. The conclusion of a branched, redundant pathway is contrary to the linear pathway revealed by classical epistasis. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D.**: This option correctly identifies the `etr1` phenotype but incorrectly claims that `ctr1` loss-of-function mutants are ethylene-insensitive. This misidentifies *CTR1* as a positive regulator. It also incorrectly claims `ein2` null mutants are constitutive, misidentifying *EIN2* as a negative regulator. The subsequent epistasis analysis is based on these flawed premises and is therefore also incorrect. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2824416"}, {"introduction": "This practice continues our exploration of genetic logic, now turning to the auxin signaling pathway, which is built upon signal-induced protein degradation.

Two broadly applicable and well-tested bases for reasoning about such pathways are: (i) the general architecture of signal transduction in which a ligand binds a receptor that, directly or indirectly, changes the activity or abundance of regulatory proteins, often including a repressor that inhibits a transcription factor, and (ii) genetic epistasis logic, in which the phenotype of a combined mutant reveals pathway order such that constitutive activation of a downstream node can bypass upstream defects, whereas a stabilized or hyperactive repressor can block upstream activations. The Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS) and Skp$1$-Cullin-F-box (SCF) E$3$ ligases provide a mechanistic route for receptor-coupled degradation of repressors, thereby derepressing transcription factors.\n\nConsider a canonical auxin pathway involving: the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE $1$/Auxin Signaling F-Box (TIR$1$/AFB) receptor, an Auxin/Indole-$3$-Acetic Acid (Aux/IAA) repressor such as IAA$14$, and an Auxin Response Factor (ARF) transcription factor such as ARF$7$.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Pathway Order and Phenotypes**\n\nThe principles provided dictate the logic of the pathway.\n1.  Auxin (the ligand) is perceived by the *TIR1/AFB* receptor.\n2.  The problem states that receptor activation leads to the degradation of a repressor (*Aux/IAA*) via the $SCF^{TIR1/AFB}$ E3 ligase complex. This means the receptor's function is to eliminate the repressor. Therefore, *TIR1/AFB* acts upstream of *Aux/IAA*, and its action is to negatively regulate the abundance of the *Aux/IAA* protein.\n3.  The problem states that repressors inhibit transcription factors. Here, the *Aux/IAA* repressor inhibits the *ARF* transcription factor. This is further supported by the `ARF7-ΔPB1-VP16` allele, which is made resistant to repression by removing the *Aux/IAA* binding domain. Thus, *Aux/IAA* acts upstream of *ARF*, negatively regulating its activity.\n4.  The *ARF* transcription factor, when active, promotes the expression of auxin-responsive genes, leading to the observed phenotypes (*DR5* reporter, lateral roots).\n\nThe linear pathway order derived from these principles is:\nAuxin → *TIR1/AFB* ⊣ *Aux/IAA* ⊣ *ARF* → Auxin Response\n\nThe notation `A ⊣ B` signifies that *A* negatively regulates *B*. In the presence of auxin, *TIR1/AFB* activity is stimulated, which leads to the degradation of the *Aux/IAA* repressor. The removal of the *Aux/IAA* repressor de-represses (activates) the *ARF* transcription factor, which then activates target gene expression. The order of the components is *TIR1/AFB* → *Aux/IAA* → *ARF*.\n\nNow, we apply epistasis logic to predict the phenotypes of compound mutants, based on this order. The fundamental rule is that a downstream component's phenotype masks (is epistatic to) the phenotype of an upstream component.\n\n-   **`IAA14-ΔDII` (stabilized repressor) is epistatic to `TIR1ox` (receptor overexpression):**\n    The `IAA14-ΔDII` repressor cannot be degraded. Overexpressing the *TIR1* receptor cannot overcome this, as the receptor's function is precisely to target the repressor for degradation via a degron that is now absent. The stabilized repressor will constitutively bind to and inhibit the *ARF* transcription factor. Therefore, the pathway output will remain low. The repressor is downstream of the receptor, so its gain-of-function phenotype (low output) is epistatic to the receptor's gain-of-function phenotype (high output).\n\n-   **`ARF7-ΔPB1-VP16` (constitutive TF) is epistatic to `tir1 afb2 afb3` (receptor loss-of-function):**\n    The `ARF7-ΔPB1-VP16` transcription factor is engineered to be constitutively active and independent of the repressor. Since the TF is the most downstream of the three components, its activity dictates the final output. The lack of an upstream receptor (`tir1 afb2 afb3`) is irrelevant, as the constitutive TF bypasses the entire upstream signaling cascade. The phenotype will be high auxin output.\n\n-   **`arf7 arf19` (TF loss-of-function) is epistatic to `TIR1ox` (receptor overexpression):**\n    The `arf7 arf19` double mutant lacks the final transcription factors required to activate auxin-responsive genes. No matter how strongly the upstream pathway is activated (e.g., by overexpressing the receptor), there can be no output if the final activator is absent. The phenotype will be low auxin output. The loss-of-function of the most downstream component is epistatic to the gain-of-function of an upstream component.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A. Order: *TIR1/AFB* → *Aux/IAA* → *ARF*. Predictions: `tir1 afb2 afb3` shows low *DR5* and few lateral roots; `IAA14-ΔDII` is epistatic to `TIR1ox`, so auxin responses remain low despite receptor overexpression; `ARF7-ΔPB1-VP16` is epistatic to `tir1 afb2 afb3`, giving high *DR5* and lateral roots without exogenous auxin; `arf7 arf19` is epistatic to `TIR1ox`, yielding low *DR5* and no lateral roots despite receptor overexpression.**\n    -   The proposed order is correct based on our derivation from first principles.\n    -   The prediction for `tir1 afb2 afb3` (low output) is correct.\n    -   The prediction that `IAA14-ΔDII` is epistatic to `TIR1ox` (low output) is correct.\n    -   The prediction that `ARF7-ΔPB1-VP16` is epistatic to `tir1 afb2 afb3` (high output) is correct.\n    -   The prediction that `arf7 arf19` is epistatic to `TIR1ox` (low output) is correct.\n    -   All statements in this option are internally consistent and logically sound.\n    -   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **B.

The receptor acts on the repressor, not vice-versa.\n    -   The subsequent predictions are logically flawed. For example, `TIR1ox` cannot override a stabilized repressor. Also, a downstream constitutive TF (`ARF7-ΔPB1-VP16`) must bypass an upstream receptor defect, not be blocked by it.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. Order: *TIR1/AFB* → *Aux/IAA* → *ARF*. Predictions: `tir1 afb2 afb3` shows low *DR5*; `TIR1ox` overcomes `IAA14-ΔDII` to give high *DR5*; `ARF7-ΔPB1-VP16` cannot bypass `tir1 afb2 afb3`; `arf7 arf19` exhibits high *DR5* if *IAA14* is degraded.**\n    -   The proposed order is correct.\n    -   However, the predictions are inconsistent with epistasis logic. `TIR1ox` cannot overcome a stabilized repressor. A constitutive TF (`ARF7-ΔPB1-VP16`) must bypass an upstream defect. If the TFs are non-functional (`arf7 arf19`), degrading the repressor will have no effect on output.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. Order: *TIR1/AFB* → *ARF* → *Aux/IAA*. Predictions: `tir1 afb2 afb3` shows low *DR5*; `IAA14-ΔDII` does not affect *DR5* because the repressor acts downstream of the transcription factor; `ARF7-ΔPB1-VP16` requires *TIR1* to be active; `TIR1ox` elevates *DR5* even in `arf7 arf19`.**\n    -   The proposed order is incorrect. The repressor (*Aux/IAA*) acts on the transcription factor (*ARF*), not the other way around.\n    -   The predictions are consequently flawed. The repressor is central to controlling the TF. A constitutive TF does not require upstream signals. The absence of the TF (`arf7 arf19`) results in no pathway output, regardless of upstream activity.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, only option A provides the correct pathway order and a set of phenotypic predictions that are completely consistent with the established principles of genetic epistasis and auxin signal transduction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2824424"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative genetic architecture to quantitative functional analysis, this exercise guides you in building a mathematical model of a signaling system from first principles. You will describe the dynamics of a cytokinin two-component phosphorelay using ordinary differential equations ($ODEs$) based on mass-action kinetics. By solving for the steady-state response, you will gain a deeper, quantitative understanding of how pathway output is shaped by hormone concentration and the activity of regulatory enzymes like phosphatases [@problem_id:2824423].", "problem": "A minimal cytokinin two-component system in plants can be modeled as a histidine kinase (HK) sensor that becomes autophosphorylated in response to cytokinin (CK) and transfers the phosphate to a response regulator (ARR), which is then dephosphorylated by a constitutive phosphatase. Assume a well-mixed compartment of fixed volume and the following species: unphosphorylated histidine kinase $HK$, phosphorylated histidine kinase $HK\\text{-}P$, unphosphorylated response regulator $ARR$, and phosphorylated response regulator $ARR\\text{-}P$. The cytokinin input is represented by its concentration $C$, which increases the autophosphorylation rate of $HK$ linearly. The phosphatase activity is represented by a dimensionless activity factor $X$ that scales the first-order dephosphorylation rate constant on $ARR\\text{-}P$. Let the total histidine kinase and total response regulator be conserved, with $H_T = [HK] + [HK\\text{-}P]$ and $R_T = [ARR] + [ARR\\text{-}P]$, respectively.\n\nAssume the following elementary reactions governed by mass-action kinetics:\n- Autophosphorylation: $HK \\xrightarrow{k_{1} C} HK\\text{-}P$;\n- Histidine kinase autodephosphorylation: $HK\\text{-}P \\xrightarrow{k_{2}} HK$;\n- Phosphotransfer: $HK\\text{-}P + ARR \\xrightarrow{k_{3}} HK + ARR\\text{-}P$;\n- Response regulator dephosphorylation: $ARR\\text{-}P \\xrightarrow{k_{4} X} ARR$.\n\nHere $k_{1}$, $k_{2}$, $k_{3}$, and $k_{4}$ are positive rate constants, $C \\ge 0$ is the cytokinin concentration, $X \\ge 0$ is the phosphatase activity factor, and $H_T, R_T  0$ are fixed totals.\n\nTasks:\n1. Using mass-action kinetics and the conservation relations, write the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for $[HK\\text{-}P](t)$ and $[ARR\\text{-}P](t)$ in terms of $k_{1}$, $k_{2}$, $k_{3}$, $k_{4}$, $C$, $X$, $H_T$, and $R_T$.\n2. By imposing steady state, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the steady-state level $[ARR\\text{-}P]^{\\ast}$ as a function of the cytokinin input $C$ and the phosphatase activity $X$, along with the parameters $k_{1}$, $k_{2}$, $k_{3}$, $k_{4}$, $H_T$, and $R_T$.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique, physically meaningful solution. The model represents a standard simplification of a two-component signaling system, and thetasks—deriving the governing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and finding the steady-state solution—are standard procedures in chemical kinetics and systems biology.\n\nLet us denote the concentrations of the species as follows: $[HK]$, $[HK\\text{-}P]$, $[ARR]$, and $[ARR\\text{-}P]$. The total concentrations of the histidine kinase and the response regulator are conserved:\n$$H_T = [HK] + [HK\\text{-}P]$$\n$$R_T = [ARR] + [ARR\\text{-}P]$$\nFrom these conservation laws, we can express the concentrations of the unphosphorylated species in terms of the phosphorylated ones:\n$$[HK] = H_T - [HK\\text{-}P]$$\n$$[ARR] = R_T - [ARR\\text{-}P]$$\n\nThe system is described by four elementary reactions with rates governed by the law of mass action:\n1.

Rate: $v_3 = k_3 [HK\\text{-}P] [ARR] = k_3 [HK\\text{-}P] (R_T - [ARR\\text{-}P])$.\n4.  Dephosphorylation: $ARR\\text{-}P \\xrightarrow{k_{4} X} ARR$. Rate: $v_4 = k_4 X [ARR\\text{-}P]$.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**\n\nWe derive the ODEs for the concentrations of the phosphorylated species, $[HK\\text{-}P]$ and $[ARR\\text{-}P]$, by summing the rates of the reactions that produce and consume them.\n\nThe rate of change for $[HK\\text{-}P]$ is given by the sum of rates producing it ($v_1$) minus the rates consuming it ($v_2$ and $v_3$):\n$$\\frac{d[HK\\text{-}P]}{dt} = v_1 - v_2 - v_3$$\nSubstituting the rate expressions, we obtain the first ODE:\n$$\\frac{d[HK\\text{-}P]}{dt} = k_1 C (H_T - [HK\\text{-}P]) - k_2 [HK\\text{-}P] - k_3 [HK\\text{-}P] (R_T - [ARR\\text{-}P])$$\n\nThe rate of change for $[ARR\\text{-}P]$ is given by the rate producing it ($v_3$) minus the rate consuming it ($v_4$):\n$$\\frac{d[ARR\\text{-}P]}{dt} = v_3 - v_4$$\nSubstituting the rate expressions, we obtain the second ODE:\n$$\\frac{d[ARR\\text{-}P]}{dt} = k_3 [HK\\text{-}P] (R_T - [ARR\\text{-}P]) - k_4 X [ARR\\text{-}P]$$\n\nThese two equations form the system of ODEs describing the dynamics of the phosphorylated components.\n\n**Task 2: Derivation of the Steady-State Expression for $[ARR\\text{-}P]^{\\ast}$**\n\nAt steady state, the time derivatives are zero. Let $[HK\\text{-}P]^{\\ast}$ and $[ARR\\text{-}P]^{\\ast}$ denote the steady-state concentrations.\n$$\\frac{d[HK\\text{-}P]}{dt} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{d[ARR\\text{-}P]}{dt} = 0$$\nThe system of ODEs becomes a system of algebraic equations:\n$$k_1 C (H_T - [HK\\text{-}P]^{\\ast}) - k_2 [HK\\text{-}P]^{\\ast} - k_3 [HK\\text{-}P]^{\\ast} (R_T - [ARR\\text{-}P]^{\\ast}) = 0 \\quad (1)$$\n$$k_3 [HK\\text{-}P]^{\\ast} (R_T - [ARR\\text{-}P]^{\\ast}) - k_4 X [ARR\\text{-}P]^{\\ast} = 0 \\quad (2)$$\n\nFrom equation (2), we can express the term for phosphotransfer:\n$$k_3 [HK\\text{-}P]^{\\ast} (R_T - [ARR\\text{-}P]^{\\ast}) = k_4 X [ARR\\text{-}P]^{\\ast}$$\nSubstituting this into equation (1) simplifies it:\n$$k_1 C (H_T - [HK\\text{-}P]^{\\ast}) - k_2 [HK\\text{-}P]^{\\ast} - k_4 X [ARR\\text{-}P]^{\\ast} = 0$$\n$$k_1 C H_T - (k_1 C + k_2) [HK\\text{-}P]^{\\ast} = k_4 X [ARR\\text{-}P]^{\\ast} \\quad (3)$$\n\nWe now have two equations, (2) and (3), relating the two steady-state variables. We can solve for $[HK\\text{-}P]^{\\ast}$ from equation (3) and substitute it into equation (2). However, it is algebraically simpler to solve for $[HK\\text{-}P]^\\ast$ from the original steady-state equations and substitute into the other. From (1):\n$$k_1 C H_T = [HK\\text{-}P]^{\\ast} (k_1 C + k_2 + k_3 (R_T - [ARR\\text{-}P]^{\\ast}))$$\n$$[HK\\text{-}P]^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_1 C H_T}{k_1 C + k_2 + k_3 (R_T - [ARR\\text{-}P]^{\\ast})}$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[HK\\text{-}P]^{\\ast}$ into equation (2):\n$$k_3 \\left( \\frac{k_1 C H_T}{k_1 C + k_2 + k_3 (R_T - [ARR\\text{-}P]^{\\ast})} \\right) (R_T - [ARR\\text{-}P]^{\\ast}) = k_4 X [ARR\\text{-}P]^{\\ast}$$\nTo simplify the algebra, let $y = [ARR\\text{-}P]^{\\ast}$.\n$$k_1k_3 C H_T (R_T - y) = k_4 X y (k_1 C + k_2 + k_3 (R_T - y))$$\nExpanding both sides:\n$$k_1k_3 C H_T R_T - k_1k_3 C H_T y = k_4 X y (k_1 C + k_2 + k_3 R_T) - k_3k_4 X y^2$$\nWe rearrange this into a standard quadratic equation of the form $ay^2 + by + c = 0$:\n$$(k_3 k_4 X) y^2 - [k_1 k_3 C H_T + k_4 X (k_1 C + k_2 + k_3 R_T)] y + k_1 k_3 C H_T R_T = 0$$\nThe coefficients are:\n$$a = k_3 k_4 X$$\n$$b = -(k_1 k_3 C H_T + k_1 k_4 C X + k_2 k_4 X + k_3 k_4 R_T X)$$\n$$c = k_1 k_3 C H_T R_T$$\nThe parameters $k_i, H_T, R_T$ are positive, and $C, X$ are non-negative. Thus, $a \\ge 0$, $b \\le 0$, and $c \\ge 0$. The roots of the quadratic equation are given by $y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\nSince $b \\le 0$, $-b \\ge 0$. Since $a \\ge 0$ and $c \\ge 0$, $4ac \\ge 0$, so the discriminant $D = b^2 - 4ac$ is less than $b^2$, and $\\sqrt{D} \\le \\sqrt{b^2} = |b| = -b$. Both numerators, $-b + \\sqrt{D}$ and $-b - \\sqrt{D}$, are non-negative, so both roots are real and non-negative.\n\nWe must choose the physically relevant root, which must satisfy $0 \\le y \\le R_T$. Let $f(y) = ay^2+by+c$. We evaluate $f(y)$ at the boundary $y=R_T$:\n$$f(R_T) = a R_T^2 + b R_T + c$$\n$$f(R_T) = (k_3 k_4 X) R_T^2 - (k_1 k_3 C H_T + k_1 k_4 C X + k_2 k_4 X + k_3 k_4 R_T X) R_T + k_1 k_3 C H_T R_T$$\n$$f(R_T) = k_3 k_4 X R_T^2 - k_1 k_3 C H_T R_T - k_1 k_4 C X R_T - k_2 k_4 X R_T - k_3 k_4 R_T^2 X + k_1 k_3 C H_T R_T$$\nSimplifying by cancellation of terms:\n$$f(R_T) = - k_1 k_4 C X R_T - k_2 k_4 X R_T = -k_4 X R_T(k_1 C + k_2)$$\nSince all parameters are non-negative, $f(R_T) \\le 0$. The parabola $f(y)$ opens upwards ($a \\ge 0$), and $f(0) = c \\ge 0$. The fact that $f(R_T) \\le 0$ implies that one root must be in the interval $[0, R_T]$ and the other must be greater than or equal to $R_T$. The physically relevant solution is the smaller of the two roots.\n\nThe smaller root is given by the minus sign in the quadratic formula's numerator:\n$$y = [ARR\\text{-}P]^{\\ast} = \\frac{-b - \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\nThis corresponds to the physically realistic concentration. Substituting the expressions for $a$, $b$, and $c$ yields the final solution.
