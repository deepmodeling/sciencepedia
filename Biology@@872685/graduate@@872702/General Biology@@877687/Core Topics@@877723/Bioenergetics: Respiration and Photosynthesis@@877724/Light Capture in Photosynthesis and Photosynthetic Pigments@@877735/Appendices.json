The premises are physically realistic, the terminology is precise, all necessary data and definitions are provided, and the tasks are logically structured to yield a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows.\n\nTask $1$: Derivation of the fluorescence quantum yield $\\Phi_{F}$.\nLet $N(t)$ be the population of the chlorophyll donor's first singlet excited state at time $t$. The problem states that this population decays via four mutually exclusive, first-order kinetic pathways. The rate of change of the excited-state population is described by the following linear first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = - (k_{F} + k_{IC} + k_{ISC} + k_{ET}) N(t) $$\nWe define the total decay rate constant, $k_{total}$, as the sum of the individual rate constants:\n$$ k_{total} = k_{F} + k_{IC} + k_{ISC} + k_{ET} $$\nThe differential equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k_{total} N(t) $$\nIntegration of this equation from time $t=0$ to an arbitrary time $t$, with an initial excited-state population of $N(0)$ at $t=0$, yields the solution for the population decay:\n$$ N(t) = N(0) \\exp(-k_{total} t) $$\nThe rate of fluorescence at any time $t$, $R_{F}(t)$, is the product of the fluorescence rate constant $k_{F}$ and the population at that time $N(t)$:\n$$ R_{F}(t) = k_{F} N(t) = k_{F} N(0) \\exp(-k_{total} t) $$\nThe fluorescence quantum yield, $\\Phi_{F}$, is defined as the fraction of the initial excited population that decays via the fluorescence pathway. This is equivalent to the total number of photons emitted via fluorescence, $N_{F}$, divided by the initial number of excited molecules, $N(0)$. The total number of fluorescently decaying molecules is found by integrating the rate of fluorescence from $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$:\n$$ N_{F} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} R_{F}(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} k_{F} N(0) \\exp(-k_{total} t) dt $$\n$$ N_{F} = k_{F} N(0) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-k_{total} t) dt $$\nThe value of the definite integral is:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-k_{total} t) dt = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{k_{total}} \\exp(-k_{total} t) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = -\\frac{1}{k_{total}}(0 - 1) = \\frac{1}{k_{total}} $$\nSubstituting this result back gives the total number of fluorescence events:\n$$ N_{F} = k_{F} N(0) \\left(\\frac{1}{k_{total}}\\right) = \\frac{k_{F} N(0)}{k_{total}} $$\nThe fluorescence quantum yield $\\Phi_{F}$ is then:\n$$ \\Phi_{F} = \\frac{N_{F}}{N(0)} = \\frac{k_{F} N(0) / k_{total}}{N(0)} = \\frac{k_{F}}{k_{total}} $$\nFinally, substituting the expression for $k_{total}$, we obtain the closed-form analytic expression for the fluorescence quantum yield in terms of the individual rate constants:\n$$ \\Phi_{F} = \\frac{k_{F}}{k_{F} + k_{IC} + k_{ISC} + k_{ET}} $$\n\nTask $2$: Numerical evaluation of $\\Phi_{F}$.\nWe are given the following rate constants:\n$k_{F} = 4.0 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{IC} = 3.0 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{ISC} = 1.0 \\times 10^{7} \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{ET} = 2.0 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\nFirst, we compute the total decay rate constant, $k_{total}$:\n$$ k_{total} = (4.0 \\times 10^{8}) + (3.0 \\times 10^{8}) + (1.0 \\times 10^{7}) + (2.0 \\times 10^{12}) $$\n$$ k_{total} = (0.4 \\times 10^{9}) + (0.3 \\times 10^{9}) + (0.01 \\times 10^{9}) + (2000 \\times 10^{9}) = 2000.71 \\times 10^{9} \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ k_{total} = 2.00071 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nNow, we calculate the fluorescence quantum yield $\\Phi_{F}$ using the derived expression:\n$$ \\Phi_{F} = \\frac{k_{F}}{k_{total}} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{2.00071 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} $$\n$$ \\Phi_{F} \\approx 1.99929 \\times 10^{-4} $$\nRounding the result to $3$ significant figures as requested:\n$$ \\Phi_{F} \\approx 2.00 \\times 10^{-4} $$\n\nTask $3$: Quantitative justification of the effect of $k_{ET}$ on $\\Phi_{F}$.\nWe are asked to compute the logarithmic sensitivity, or elasticity, of $\\Phi_{F}$ with respect to $k_{ET}$. This quantity, $\\varepsilon_{k_{ET}}^{\\Phi_F}$, is defined as:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{k_{ET}}^{\\Phi_F} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln(\\Phi_{F})}{\\partial \\ln(k_{ET})} = \\frac{k_{ET}}{\\Phi_{F}} \\frac{\\partial \\Phi_{F}}{\\partial k_{ET}} $$\nTo compute this, we first find the partial derivative of $\\Phi_{F}$ with respect to $k_{ET}$. Let $K_{intrinsic} = k_{F} + k_{IC} + k_{ISC}$ represent the sum of the rates for all pathways other than energy transfer. Then $\\Phi_{F} = \\frac{k_{F}}{K_{intrinsic} + k_{ET}}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\Phi_{F}}{\\partial k_{ET}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_{ET}} \\left( k_{F} (K_{intrinsic} + k_{ET})^{-1} \\right) = -k_{F} (K_{intrinsic} + k_{ET})^{-2} = -\\frac{k_{F}}{(K_{intrinsic} + k_{ET})^{2}} $$\nSubstituting this into the elasticity formula:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{k_{ET}}^{\\Phi_F} = \\frac{k_{ET}}{\\frac{k_{F}}{K_{intrinsic} + k_{ET}}} \\left( -\\frac{k_{F}}{(K_{intrinsic} + k_{ET})^{2}} \\right) = \\frac{k_{ET}(K_{intrinsic} + k_{ET})}{k_{F}} \\left( -\\frac{k_{F}}{(K_{intrinsic} + k_{ET})^{2}} \\right) $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{k_{ET}}^{\\Phi_F} = -\\frac{k_{ET}}{K_{intrinsic} + k_{ET}} = -\\frac{k_{ET}}{k_{F} + k_{IC} + k_{ISC} + k_{ET}} $$\nThis expression reveals that the elasticity is the negative of the quantum yield of energy transfer, $\\Phi_{ET} = \\frac{k_{ET}}{k_{total}}$.\nNow, we evaluate this elasticity with the given parameters:\n$K_{intrinsic} = (4.0 \\times 10^{8}) + (3.0 \\times 10^{8}) + (1.0 \\times 10^{7}) = 7.1 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{k_{ET}}^{\\Phi_F} = -\\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{7.1 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 2.0 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = -\\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{12}}{2.00071 \\times 10^{12}} \\approx -0.999645 $$\nThe calculated elasticity is $\\approx -1$. An elasticity of $-1$ signifies that a $1\\%$ increase in $k_{ET}$ leads to an approximate $1\\%$ decrease in $\\Phi_{F}$. This strong inverse relationship demonstrates that $\\Phi_{F}$ is exquisitely sensitive to changes in $k_{ET}$.\n\nBiophysical Interpretation: The primary function of a light-harvesting antenna complex is to capture light energy and efficiently transfer it to the photosynthetic reaction center, where charge separation occurs. The energy transfer process (FRET, with rate $k_{ET}$) must outcompete all other non-productive decay pathways of the donor chlorophyll, including fluorescence (rate $k_F$), internal conversion (rate $k_{IC}$), and intersystem crossing (rate $k_{ISC}$). The provided parameters reflect this biological design principle: $k_{ET}$ ($2.0 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) is several orders of magnitude larger than the intrinsic decay rates ($k_F+k_{IC}+k_{ISC} \\approx 7.1 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). This ensures that the quantum yield of energy transfer $\\Phi_{ET} = k_{ET}/k_{total}$ is very close to $1$, meaning nearly every absorbed photon is productively transferred. The calculated elasticity $\\varepsilon_{k_{ET}}^{\\Phi_F} \\approx -1$ is the quantitative manifestation of this efficiency. It shows that the fluorescence is strongly quenched. Any change in the energy transfer rate has an almost equal and opposite relative effect on the fluorescence yield. Therefore, maximizing $k_{ET}$ is the key strategy used by natural photosynthetic systems to minimize wasteful energy loss through fluorescence and maximize the overall efficiency of light harvesting.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.00 \\times 10^{-4}}$$", "id": "2812849"}, {"introduction": "Why are photosynthetic organisms filled with a colorful palette of pigments, not just chlorophyll? The previous exercise treated decay rates like $k_F$ and $k_{ET}$ as given parameters, but their values are deeply rooted in a pigment's molecular structure and quantum mechanics.

By applying fundamental principles like Kasha's rule and symmetry-based selection rules, you will unravel why carotenoids are optimized for light absorption and energy dissipation, rather than emission, making them ideal accessory and photoprotective agents. [@problem_id:2812800]", "problem": "In photosynthetic light-harvesting, carotenoids serve as accessory pigments with strong visible absorption and ultrafast excited-state dynamics. Consider an idealized linear carotenoid (approximated as a polyene with inversion symmetry) in room-temperature solution. Empirically, strong absorption is observed in the visible band often assigned to the $S_0 \\rightarrow S_2$ transition, while time-resolved spectroscopy reveals very rapid $S_2 \\rightarrow S_1$ internal conversion on a sub-picosecond timescale.

The photophysical model described for carotenoids (linear polyenes) is a cornerstone of molecular spectroscopy and photochemistry, often referred to as the Vavilov-Kasha model for polyenes. The state ordering $S_0(1A_g)$, $S_1(2A_g)$, $S_2(1B_u)$ is a well-established theoretical and experimental result for sufficiently long polyenes. The principles cited—Kasha’s rule and electric-dipole selection rules based on molecular symmetry—are fundamental. The empirical data provided ($\\Phi_f \\lesssim 10^{-5}$, sub-picosecond dynamics) are consistent with extensive experimental literature. The problem is self-contained, objective, and well-posed, asking for a logical explanation based on the provided framework. It is not trivial, as it requires the synthesis of several distinct concepts.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe objective is to explain why the fluorescence quantum yield, $\\Phi_f$, is exceedingly small ($\\lesssim 10^{-5}$) for carotenoids. The quantum yield of fluorescence from an excited state is given by the ratio of the rate of radiative decay ($k_f$) to the total rate of decay (sum of radiative and all non-radiative rates, $\\sum k_{nr}$):\n\n$$\n\\Phi_f = \\frac{k_f}{k_f + \\sum k_{nr}}\n$$\n\nA very small $\\Phi_f$ implies that $k_f \\ll \\sum k_{nr}$. We must identify the physical basis for this condition using the provided information.\n\n1.  **Initial Excitation:** The molecule absorbs a photon, undergoing a transition from the ground state, $S_0$, to an excited state. The problem states this is a strong absorption to the $S_2$ state. Based on Principle 3, the ground state $S_0$ has $A_g$ symmetry. The label '$g$' denotes 'gerade' or even parity with respect to inversion. The bright visible state is identified as $S_2$, a $B_u$ state. The label '$u$' denotes 'ungerade' or odd parity. The transition is therefore $S_0(A_g) \\rightarrow S_2(B_u)$. This corresponds to a $g \\rightarrow u$ change in parity. According to Principle 2, this transition is electric-dipole allowed, which is consistent with the observation of \"strong absorption\".\n\n2.  **Excited-State Relaxation:** After excitation to $S_2$, the molecule undergoes \"very rapid $S_2 \\rightarrow S_1$ internal conversion\". This is a non-radiative process that depopulates the $S_2$ state on a sub-picosecond timescale. Any potential fluorescence from $S_2$ must compete with this ultrafast process. Since internal conversion is much faster, the quantum yield of fluorescence from $S_2$ will be negligible.\n\n3.  **Application of Kasha’s Rule:** Following the rapid population of the $S_1$ state, Principle 1 (Kasha’s rule) dictates that any subsequent fluorescence will originate from this lowest-lying singlet excited state, $S_1$. Therefore, the observed fluorescence properties are determined by the decay pathways of the $S_1$ state.\n\n4.  **Analysis of the $S_1 \\rightarrow S_0$ Transition:** To determine the rate of fluorescence ($k_f$) from $S_1$, we must analyze the $S_1 \\rightarrow S_0$ transition. According to Principle 3, the $S_1$ state (the lower-lying \"dark\" singlet) has $A_g$ symmetry, and the ground state $S_0$ also has $A_g$ symmetry. The potential fluorescence transition is therefore $S_1(A_g) \\rightarrow S_0(A_g)$. This corresponds to a $g \\rightarrow g$ transition.\n\n5.  **Application of Selection Rules:** According to Principle 2, transitions between states of the same parity ($g \\rightarrow g$) are electric-dipole forbidden. A forbidden transition has an oscillator strength that is zero in the limit of perfect symmetry. Consequently, the radiative rate constant for this transition, $k_f^{S_1 \\rightarrow S_0}$, is extremely small.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The fluorescence quantum yield from the $S_1$ state is $\\Phi_{f, S_1} = \\frac{k_f^{S_1 \\rightarrow S_0}}{k_f^{S_1 \\rightarrow S_0} + k_{nr}^{S_1}}$. Since $k_f^{S_1 \\rightarrow S_0}$ is exceptionally small due to the forbidden nature of the transition, and non-radiative decay pathways from $S_1$ (such as internal conversion to $S_0$ and energy transfer to other molecules like chlorophyll) always have a finite rate ($k_{nr}^{S_1} > 0$), the denominator is dominated by $k_{nr}^{S_1}$. This results in an extremely small value for $\\Phi_{f, S_1}$, consistent with the experimental observation that $\\Phi_f \\lesssim 10^{-5}$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Carotenoids fluoresce strongly from $S_2$, but in typical measurements the fluorescence is immediately reabsorbed (inner-filter effect), giving the appearance of no emission even at dilute concentrations.**\n    This is incorrect. The assertion of \"strong fluorescence from $S_2$\" is false. The problem explicitly states that $S_2 \\rightarrow S_1$ internal conversion is ultrafast, which means this non-radiative pathway overwhelmingly outcompetes the radiative decay from $S_2$. The lifetime of the $S_2$ state is too short for significant fluorescence to occur. Furthermore, the inner-filter effect is concentration-dependent and cannot be the primary explanation for a phenomenon observed even under dilute conditions where reabsorption is minimal. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **B. The $S_2 \\rightarrow S_1$ internal conversion is ultrafast, and by Kasha’s rule emission would originate from $S_1$. In polyenes, $S_1$ is of $A_g$ symmetry while $S_0$ is also $A_g$, making $S_1 \\rightarrow S_0$ an electric-dipole $g \\rightarrow g$ transition that is parity-forbidden and has vanishing oscillator strength in the symmetry limit. Thus the radiative rate $k_f^{S_1 \\rightarrow S_0}$ is extremely small; nonradiative decay and energy-transfer pathways dominate, yielding negligible fluorescence.**\n    This option precisely follows the logical derivation presented above. It correctly connects ultrafast dynamics, Kasha’s rule, the specific symmetries of the $S_0$ and $S_1$ states, and the electric-dipole selection rules to conclude that the $S_1 \\rightarrow S_0$ radiative rate is minimal. This provides a complete and accurate explanation for the negligible fluorescence quantum yield. **Correct**.\n\n*   **C. Strong spin–orbit coupling in carotenoids drives very fast intersystem crossing (ISC) $S_2 \\rightarrow T_n$, so that phosphorescence dominates and lies outside the detector window, explaining the apparent lack of fluorescence.**\n    This is incorrect. Carotenoids are composed of light atoms (C, H), for which spin-orbit coupling is characteristically weak. Consequently, intersystem crossing (ISC), a spin-forbidden process, is generally much slower than the allowed singlet-state internal conversion processes. It cannot compete with the sub-picosecond $S_2 \\rightarrow S_1$ internal conversion. The lack of fluorescence is being explained, not a hypothetical dominance of phosphorescence, which itself is also typically very weak for these molecules for the same reason (weak spin-orbit coupling). **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. The absence of fluorescence indicates a breakdown of Kasha’s rule in carotenoids; they would emit from $S_2$, but $S_2 \\rightarrow S_0$ is symmetry-forbidden, preventing detection.**\n    This is incorrect and internally contradictory. First, it baselessly assumes a breakdown of Kasha's rule. Second, and more critically, it claims the $S_2 \\rightarrow S_0$ transition is symmetry-forbidden. This contradicts the provided information that the corresponding absorption, $S_0 \\rightarrow S_2$, is \"strong\". For a transition to be strongly absorbing, it must be allowed. By the principle of microscopic reversibility, the corresponding emission process, $S_2 \\rightarrow S_0$, must also be allowed. In fact, the $S_0(A_g) \\rightarrow S_2(B_u)$ transition is a $g \\rightarrow u$ transition and is fully allowed. The premise of this option is factually wrong based on the problem statement itself. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **E. Vibronic coupling completely lifts parity restrictions so that $S_1 \\rightarrow S_0$ should be strongly allowed; therefore the lack of fluorescence must exclusively arise from collisional quenching in solution, not from intrinsic electronic structure.**\n    This is incorrect. Vibronic coupling, which involves the coupling of electronic states through molecular vibrations, can relax a symmetry selection rule, but it does not \"completely lift\" the restriction to make a forbidden transition \"strongly allowed\". A vibronically-induced transition is always much weaker than a fully allowed electronic transition. Therefore, the premise that $S_1 \\rightarrow S_0$ *should be* strongly allowed is false. The low intrinsic radiative rate constant $k_f$ remains the principal factor. Ascribing the phenomenon *exclusively* to collisional quenching, an external environmental effect, ignores the dominant role of the molecule's intrinsic electronic structure, which is the root cause. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2812800"}, {"introduction": "Individual pigments are only part of the story; the true magic of light harvesting lies in their collective behavior within a protein scaffold.

We proceed directly to the derivation and computational strategy.\n\nThe physical system is a molecular aggregate of $N$ pigments, or sites, described by a Frenkel exciton Hamiltonian. In the site basis $\\{\\lvert i \\rangle\\}$, where $\\lvert i \\rangle$ represents an electronic excitation localized on site $i$, the Hamiltonian operator $H$ is represented by an $N \\times N$ matrix. The diagonal elements $H_{ii} = E_i$ are the local excitation energies of each pigment, and the off-diagonal elements $H_{ij} = J_{ij}$ ($i \\neq j$) are the excitonic couplings between pigments. The Hamiltonian is real and symmetric, as $J_{ij} = J_{ji}$.\n\nThe stationary states of this system, known as exciton states, are found by solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation, which in matrix form is the eigenvalue problem:\n$$\nH \\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{C} \\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\n$$\nHere, $\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}$ is a diagonal matrix whose elements $\\Lambda_{nn} = \\lambda_n$ are the eigenvalues of $H$. These eigenvalues correspond to the energies of the exciton states. $\\mathbf{C}$ is a matrix whose columns are the corresponding eigenvectors. Each eigenvector, denoted $\\mathbf{c}_n$, describes the $n$-th exciton state as a linear combination of the site-basis states: $\\lvert \\text{exciton}_n \\rangle = \\sum_i C_{in} \\lvert i \\rangle$. The coefficient $C_{in}$ is the amplitude of site $i$ in exciton state $n$. Since $H$ is a real symmetric matrix, its eigenvalues $\\lambda_n$ are real, and its eigenvectors can be chosen to form a real orthonormal basis, satisfying the normalization condition $\\sum_i C_{in}^2 = 1$ for each exciton state $n$.\n\nThe core of the problem is to construct this Hamiltonian matrix $H$ for each test case, numerically diagonalize it to obtain the eigenvalues $\\{\\lambda_n\\}$ and eigenvectors $\\{C_{in}\\}$, and then compute a set of specified observables.\n\nThe computational steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Hamiltonian Construction**: For each test case, a real symmetric $N \\times N$ matrix $H$ is initialized, where $N=9$. The diagonal elements $H_{ii}$ are populated with the given site energies $\\{E_i\\}$. The off-diagonal elements $H_{ij}$ and $H_{ji}$ are populated with the given coupling constants $\\{J_{ij}\\}$. All unspecified couplings are zero.\n\n2.  **Diagonalization**: The matrix $H$ is diagonalized to find its eigenvalues $\\lambda_n$ and the matrix of eigenvectors $\\mathbf{C}$. This is a standard procedure in numerical linear algebra. The columns of $\\mathbf{C}$ are the eigenvectors, with $C_{in}$ being the $i$-th component of the $n$-th eigenvector.\n\n3.  **Calculation of Observables**:\n    *   **Group Weights ($w_{n,\\mathcal{G}}$)**: The contribution of an exciton state $n$ to a group of pigments $\\mathcal{G}$ (either $\\mathcal{G}_{850}$ or $\\mathcal{G}_{800}$) is calculated as the sum of squared eigenvector components over the sites in that group:\n        $$\n        w_{n,\\mathcal{G}} = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{G}} C_{in}^2\n        $$\n        This quantity represents the probability of finding the exciton within group $\\mathcal{G}$.\n    *   **Energy Centroids ($E_{\\mathcal{G}}$)**: The average energy of excitons associated with a group $\\mathcal{G}$ is the energy centroid, defined as a weighted average of the exciton energies:\n        $$\n        E_{\\mathcal{G}} = \\frac{\\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_{n,\\mathcal{G}} \\lambda_n}{\\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_{n,\\mathcal{G}}}\n        $$\n        The denominator, $\\sum_{n} w_{n,\\mathcal{G}}$, simplifies to the number of sites in the group, $|\\mathcal{G}|$.\n    *   **Absorption Band Splitting ($S$)**: This is the difference between the energy centroids of the two pigment groups:\n        $$\n        S = E_{\\mathcal{G}_{800}} - E_{\\mathcal{G}_{850}}\n        $$\n    *   **Participation Ratio ($\\mathrm{PR}_n$)**: The delocalization of each exciton state $n$ is quantified by the participation ratio:\n        $$\n        \\mathrm{PR}_n = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} C_{in}^4}\n        $$\n        A value of $\\mathrm{PR}_n = 1$ indicates complete localization on a single site, while a value of $\\mathrm{PR}_n = N$ indicates complete delocalization over all $N$ sites.\n    *   **Mean Participation Ratios**: Three average delocalization metrics are computed:\n        *   Unweighted mean: $\\overline{\\mathrm{PR}} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\mathrm{PR}_n$\n        *   B850-weighted mean: $\\mathrm{PR}_{850} = \\frac{\\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_{n,\\mathcal{G}_{850}} \\mathrm{PR}_n}{\\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_{n,\\mathcal{G}_{850}}}$\n        *   B800-weighted mean: $\\mathrm{PR}_{800} = \\frac{\\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_{n,\\mathcal{G}_{800}} \\mathrm{PR}_n}{\\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_{n,\\mathcal{G}_{800}}}$\n\nThese calculations are performed for each of the three test cases specified.
