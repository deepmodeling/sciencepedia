It is well-posed, providing all necessary information and clear definitions to arrive at a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is formalizable, directly relevant to the topic of antigen presentation, and does not contain internal contradictions, unrealistic parameters, or a trivial structure.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe dynamics of the system are described by the law of mass action. The rate of change of the concentration of the peptide-bound MHC complex, $[MP]$, is given by the rate of its formation minus the rate of its dissociation.\n\nThe rate of formation (association) is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants, $[M]$ and $[P]$. Thus, the forward rate is $k_{\\text{on}}[M][P]$.\nThe rate of dissociation (dissociation) is proportional to the concentration of the complex, $[MP]$. Thus, the reverse rate is $k_{\\text{off}}[MP]$.\n\nThe net rate of change of $[MP]$ is therefore described by the following differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d[MP]}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}[M][P] - k_{\\text{off}}[MP]\n$$\nThe problem requires the derivation to start from the definition of chemical equilibrium. At chemical equilibrium, the net rate of change of all species concentrations is zero. Therefore, at equilibrium, we set $\\frac{d[MP]}{dt} = 0$. Let $[M]_{\\text{eq}}$ and $[MP]_{\\text{eq}}$ denote the concentrations at equilibrium.\n$$\nk_{\\text{on}}[M]_{\\text{eq}}[P] = k_{\\text{off}}[MP]_{\\text{eq}}\n$$\nNote that $[P]$ does not have an equilibrium subscript because it is assumed to be constant throughout the process.\n\nThe problem asks for the equilibrium ratio $r \\equiv f_{\\text{empty}}/f_{\\text{bound}}$. We first express this ratio in terms of equilibrium concentrations:\n$$\nr = \\frac{f_{\\text{empty}}}{f_{\\text{bound}}} = \\frac{[M]_{\\text{eq}}/[M]_{\\text{tot}}}{[MP]_{\\text{eq}}/[M]_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{[M]_{\\text{eq}}}{[MP]_{\\text{eq}}}\n$$\nWe can rearrange the equilibrium condition to solve for this ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{[M]_{\\text{eq}}}{[MP]_{\\text{eq}}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}[P]}\n$$\nThus, the expression for the ratio $r$ is:\n$$\nr = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}[P]}\n$$\nThis expression is derived strictly from mass-action kinetics and the definition of equilibrium as required. It is noted that the ratio of rate constants, $k_{\\text{off}}/k_{\\text{on}}$, is the definition of the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$. Therefore, $r = K_D / [P]$.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided values. First, all concentrations must be in consistent units, typically Molarity ($\\text{M}$).\nThe peptide concentration is given as $[P] = 50\\,\\text{nM}$. We convert this to $\\text{M}$:\n$$\n[P] = 50\\,\\text{nM} = 50 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{M} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{M}\n$$\nThe rate constants are given as:\n$$\nk_{\\text{on}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nk_{\\text{off}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $r$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{(1.0 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{M})}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the product in the denominator:\n$$\n(1.0 \\times 10^{5}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-8}) = 5.0 \\times 10^{5-8} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\nThe units in the denominator become $(\\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times \\text{M} = \\text{s}^{-1}$.\nNow, compute the ratio:\n$$\nr = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{1.0}{5.0} = 0.2\n$$\nThe units cancel out, so $r$ is dimensionless, as expected for a ratio of fractions.\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nr = 0.2000\n$$\nFor the biological interpretation: The ratio $r = 0.2000$ represents the ratio of empty MHC to peptide-bound MHC at equilibrium. A value of $r < 1$ signifies that the concentration of peptide-bound MHC complexes is greater than that of empty MHC molecules. Specifically, $[MP]_{\\text{eq}} = [M]_{\\text{eq}} / r = [M]_{\\text{eq}} / 0.2000 = 5 \\times [M]_{\\text{eq}}$. This indicates that at equilibrium, the population of MHC molecules is predominantly loaded with peptides, with approximately $83.3\\%$ ($1/(1+0.2)$) of the total MHC being in the peptide-bound state. For efficient antigen presentation to T cells, it is critical for a large number of peptide-MHC complexes to be displayed on the antigen-presenting cell surface. A high degree of MHC occupancy, as suggested by this low value of $r$, ensures a strong signal for T cell surveillance and activation, contributing to the efficacy of the adaptive immune response.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.2000}\n$$", "id": "2776602"}, {"introduction": "In a real cell, a single MHC allele is presented with a diverse pool of peptides, yet the immune response often focuses on only a few—a phenomenon known as immunodominance.

A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe tasks will be addressed sequentially. For clarity, we will let the indices $i=1, 2, 3$ correspond to peptides $A, B, C$ respectively.\n\n**1) Surface Half-Life, $t_{1/2,i}$**\nThe loss of a pMHC complex from the cell surface is stated to follow first-order kinetics, governed by the dissociation rate constant $k_{\\text{off},i}$. The number of complexes of type $i$, $N_i(t)$, remaining at time $t$ from an initial population $N_i(0)$ is described by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_i}{dt} = -k_{\\text{off},i} N_i\n$$\nThe solution to this equation is an exponential decay function:\n$$\nN_i(t) = N_i(0) \\exp(-k_{\\text{off},i} t)\n$$\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2,i}$, is defined as the time at which the population decays to half of its initial value, i.e., $N_i(t_{1/2,i}) = \\frac{1}{2} N_i(0)$. Substituting this into the decay equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} N_i(0) = N_i(0) \\exp(-k_{\\text{off},i} t_{1/2,i})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k_{\\text{off},i} t_{1/2,i})\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k_{\\text{off},i} t_{1/2,i}\n$$\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -k_{\\text{off},i} t_{1/2,i}\n$$\nThus, the expression for the half-life is:\n$$\nt_{1/2,i} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\text{off},i}}\n$$\nUsing the provided data:\n- For peptide $A$ ($i=1$): $t_{1/2,A} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}~\\text{s}^{-1}} = 10000 \\ln(2)~\\text{s}$.\n- For peptide $B$ ($i=2$): $t_{1/2,B} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{2.0 \\times 10^{-4}~\\text{s}^{-1}} = 5000 \\ln(2)~\\text{s}$.\n- For peptide $C$ ($i=3$): $t_{1/2,C} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{5.0 \\times 10^{-5}~\\text{s}^{-1}} = 20000 \\ln(2)~\\text{s}$.\n\n**2) Steady-State Surface Abundance, $N_i$**\nThe steady-state surface abundance, $N_i$, is achieved when the rate of arrival of pMHC$_i$ complexes at the cell surface equals their rate of loss from the surface. Let these rates be $R_{\\text{in},i}$ and $R_{\\text{out},i}$, respectively.\nAt steady state, $\\frac{dN_i}{dt} = R_{\\text{in},i} - R_{\\text{out},i} = 0$, which implies $R_{\\text{in},i} = R_{\\text{out},i}$.\n\nThe rate of loss from the surface is given by the first-order dissociation process:\n$$\nR_{\\text{out},i} = k_{\\text{off},i} N_i\n$$\nThe rate of arrival at the surface, $R_{\\text{in},i}$, is proportional to the rate of formation of pMHC$_i$ complexes in the ER, since trafficking is not limiting and identical for all species. Let the rate of formation in the ER be $V_{\\text{form},i}$.\n$$\nR_{\\text{in},i} = \\alpha V_{\\text{form},i}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a proportionality constant for trafficking.\n\nThe formation rate is given as proportional to $k_{\\text{on},i} [\\text{P}_i] [\\text{HLA}_{\\text{free}}]$:\n$$\nV_{\\text{form},i} = \\beta k_{\\text{on},i} [\\text{P}_i] [\\text{HLA}_{\\text{free}}]\n$$\nwhere $\\beta$ is another proportionality constant. Since the free HLA-I pool, $[\\text{HLA}_{\\text{free}}]$, is assumed to be constant and not limiting, we can combine all constants ($\\alpha, \\beta, [\\text{HLA}_{\\text{free}}]$) into a single common proportionality constant, $C$.\n$$\nR_{\\text{in},i} = C \\cdot k_{\\text{on},i} [\\text{P}_i]\n$$\nEquating the rates for steady state:\n$$\nC \\cdot k_{\\text{on},i} [\\text{P}_i] = k_{\\text{off},i} N_i\n$$\nSolving for $N_i$:\n$$\nN_i = C \\cdot \\frac{k_{\\text{on},i}}{k_{\\text{off},i}} [\\text{P}_i]\n$$\nThe problem requires the expression in terms of $K_{D,i}$. We use the definition $K_{D,i} = k_{\\text{off},i} / k_{\\text{on},i}$, which implies that $\\frac{1}{K_{D,i}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{on},i}}{k_{\\text{off},i}}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $N_i$:\n$$\nN_i = C \\frac{[\\text{P}_i]}{K_{D,i}}\n$$\nThis is the desired expression for the steady-state surface abundance, which is proportional to the ratio of peptide concentration to its dissociation constant. The quantity we can compare between peptides is $\\frac{[\\text{P}_i]}{K_{D,i}}$.\n\n**3) Identification of the Immunodominant Peptide**\nImmunodominance is defined by the highest surface abundance $N_i$. Since $N_i \\propto \\frac{[\\text{P}_i]}{K_{D,i}}$, we must compute this ratio for each peptide. The units of concentration (nM) cancel, resulting in a dimensionless quantity.\n- For peptide $A$ ($i=1$): $\\frac{[\\text{P}_A]}{K_{D,A}} = \\frac{20}{5} = 4$.\n- For peptide $B$ ($i=2$): $\\frac{[\\text{P}_B]}{K_{D,B}} = \\frac{50}{20} = 2.5$.\n- For peptide $C$ ($i=3$): $\\frac{[\\text{P}_C]}{K_{D,C}} = \\frac{100}{200} = 0.5$.\n\nComparing the values: $4 > 2.5 > 0.5$. The ratio is maximal for peptide $A$. Therefore, peptide $A$ (peptide $1$) is predicted to be immunodominant.\n\n**4) Normalized Dominance Fraction, $f$**\nThe fraction $f$ is defined as $f = \\frac{N_{\\max}}{N_{A} + N_{B} + N_{C}}$.\nFrom task 3, $N_{\\max} = N_A$.\nWe have $N_A = C \\cdot 4$, $N_B = C \\cdot 2.5$, and $N_C = C \\cdot 0.5$.\nSubstituting these into the formula for $f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{N_A}{N_A + N_B + N_C} = \\frac{C \\cdot 4}{C \\cdot 4 + C \\cdot 2.5 + C \\cdot 0.5}\n$$\nThe constant $C$ cancels out:\n$$\nf = \\frac{4}{4 + 2.5 + 0.5} = \\frac{4}{7}\n$$\nAs a decimal number, $f \\approx 0.57142857...$.

Key parameters mentioned are adequate library coverage, low multiplicity of infection (MOI), appropriate controls, and a direct readout.\n-   **Objective:** Identify host genes specifically required for cross-presentation of cell-associated protein antigens, while controlling for antigen uptake, general MHC class I surface expression, and non-specific effects on cell viability or activation state.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem statement is firmly grounded in established principles of immunology and molecular cell biology. The definitions of MHC class I presentation, cross-presentation, and the description of CRISPR-Cas$9$ screening methodology are all factually correct and represent current scientific consensus.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear and specific objective: to select the best experimental design from a list of options based on a detailed set of criteria (specificity, rigorous controls). The goal is unambiguous.\n-   **Objective:** The language is technical and devoid of subjective or non-scientific content.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency:** The information provided is sufficient to evaluate the proposed experimental designs. There are no internal contradictions. For instance, the acknowledgment of both TAP-dependent and TAP-independent pathways for cross-presentation is an accurate reflection of the biological complexity and does not constitute a contradiction.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and based on objective, verifiable principles. The task is a rigorous test of understanding experimental design in immunology. I will now proceed with the analysis of the options.\n\nThe objective is to identify the experimental design that most specifically interrogates the machinery of cross-presentation for *cell-associated* protein antigens. This requires:\n$1$. The correct cell type (a professional antigen-presenting cell, or APC, like a DC).\n$2$. The correct antigen source (a protein antigen originating from another cell).\n$3$. A readout that directly measures the outcome of cross-presentation (i.e., peptide-MHC class I complexes on the APC surface).\n$4$. A comprehensive set of controls to exclude genes involved in other processes, such as antigen uptake, canonical MHC class I trafficking, general cell viability, or MHC class II presentation.\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option against these criteria.\n\n**A. Use Cas9-expressing mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) transduced at low MOI (target $\\text{MOI}  0.3$) with a genome-wide single guide RNA (sgRNA) library at > $300\\times$ representation. Feed DCs with apoptotic, ovalbumin (OVA)-expressing donor cells labeled with a pH-stable dye to track uptake. After co-culture, stain with the $25$-$\\mathrm{D1.16}$ monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the $\\mathrm{H\\text{-}2K^{b}\\text{-}SIINFEKL}$ complex, and perform fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate the lowest decile of $\\mathrm{H\\text{-}2K^{b}\\text{-}SIINFEKL}$ signal among dye-positive (i.e., phagocytosis-positive), live, $\\mathrm{CD11c^{+}}$ DCs. Sequence sgRNAs enriched in the low-signal fraction to identify candidate genes. In parallel, (i) pulse an aliquot of the same edited DCs with the SIINFEKL peptide to ensure that general MHC class I loading and surface trafficking are intact (candidates that appear only in the cross-presentation arm but not in the peptide-pulsed control are prioritized), and (ii) perform an MHC class II presentation control by feeding OVA protein and co-culturing with $OVA_{323\\text{–}339}$-specific $\\mathrm{CD4^{+}}$ T cells to exclude genes acting only through MHC class II. Include Beta-2 microglobulin ($B2m$), $\\mathrm{Tap1}$, and proteasome immunosubunits as positive controls expected to reduce the $\\mathrm{H\\text{-}2K^{b}\\text{-}SIINFEKL}$ signal in the cross-presentation arm but not upon peptide pulsing.**\n\nThis design is exceptionally rigorous.\n-   **Cell Type:** BMDCs are appropriate professional APCs specialized for cross-presentation.\n-   **Antigen Source:** Apoptotic OVA-expressing cells are a perfect example of a \"cell-associated antigen source,\" mimicking physiological conditions where DCs sample dead or dying cells.\n-   **Readout:** The $25$-$\\mathrm{D1.16}$ antibody provides a direct, quantitative measurement of the specific end product of cross-presentation: the $\\mathrm{H\\text{-}2K^{b}\\text{-}SIINFEKL}$ complex on the DC surface. This is far superior to indirect readouts like T cell activation.\n-   **Controls:** The design includes a full suite of essential controls.\n    -   **Uptake:** Gating on dye-positive cells correctly isolates defects in presentation from upstream defects in phagocytosis.\n    -   **Viability/Cell Type:** Gating on live, $\\mathrm{CD11c^{+}}$ cells ensures data quality and specificity.\n    -   **Canonical MHC I Pathway:** The SIINFEKL peptide-pulse control is crucial. It allows for the specific identification of genes required for processing and transport *prior* to peptide loading in the ER, distinguishing them from genes essential for the general MHC class I pathway (like $B2m$ or TAP).\n    -   **MHC Class II Pathway:** The suggested MHC class II control further refines the specificity of the screen.\n    -   **Positive Controls:** The inclusion of known required genes ($B2m$, $\\mathrm{Tap1}$, proteasome subunits) validates the experimental system. The logic for how these controls would behave is sound.\n-   **Screen Parameters:** The mention of low MOI and high library representation indicates a well-planned CRISPR screen.\n\n**Verdict for A:** **Correct**. This option describes a state-of-the-art, highly specific, and rigorously controlled experiment that perfectly matches the stated objective.\n\n**B. Use a genome-wide CRISPR screen in an OVA-expressing tumor cell line. Co-culture edited tumor cells with SIINFEKL-specific $\\mathrm{CD8^{+}}$ T cells and select for tumor cells that survive T cell killing. Sequence sgRNAs enriched in survivors to identify host factors required for antigen processing and presentation.**\n\nThis design is fundamentally flawed because it investigates the wrong biological process.\n-   **Process:** The screen is performed in the OVA-expressing tumor cell, which presents an *endogenous* antigen. This is the canonical MHC class I pathway, not cross-presentation. Cross-presentation involves an APC (like a DC) presenting an *exogenous* antigen derived from another cell (like this tumor cell). This experiment screens for genes required for the tumor cell to present its own antigens, not for a DC to cross-present tumor antigens.\n-   **Readout:** T cell killing is an indirect readout that can be affected by numerous escape mechanisms unrelated to antigen presentation (e.g., upregulation of programmed death-ligand $1$ ($\\mathrm{PD-L1}$), downregulation of death receptors, mutations in apoptotic pathways).\n\n**Verdict for B:** **Incorrect**. It fails to investigate cross-presentation.\n\n**C. Use CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) in a DC line. Pulse cells with the SIINFEKL peptide and measure $\\mathrm{CD8^{+}}$ T cell activation (interferon-$\\gamma$ release) to read out MHC class I presentation. Controls include knocking down $B2m$ and staining total MHC class I surface levels by flow cytometry.**\n\nThis design is flawed because it bypasses the key steps of the process under investigation.\n-   **Antigen Source:** The experiment uses the pre-processed SIINFEKL peptide. This completely bypasses all the upstream events that define cross-presentation of a protein antigen: uptake of the antigen source, trafficking to a specific compartment, export from that compartment to the cytosol, and proteasomal degradation into peptides. This screen would only identify factors involved in the final steps of peptide loading and surface transport, which are part of the *general* MHC class I pathway, not specific to cross-presentation.\n-   **Goal Mismatch:** The problem explicitly requires identifying factors for \"cross-presentation of cell-associated protein antigens,\" not peptide loading.\n\n**Verdict for C:** **Incorrect**. It does not investigate the processing of a protein antigen, which is a central component of the research question.\n\n**D. Perform a CRISPR knockout screen in macrophages using fluorescently labeled OVA protein. Sort for cells with low antigen uptake and sequence sgRNAs enriched in the low-uptake population. Validate candidates by measuring total MHC class I levels after peptide pulsing.**\n\nThis design is flawed for two major reasons.\n-   **Screen objective:** The screen is designed to sort for cells with *low antigen uptake*. Therefore, it will identify genes required for endocytosis or phagocytosis, not for antigen processing or presentation. The goal is to find genes for presentation, controlling for uptake, not the other way around.\n-   **Antigen Source:** It uses soluble OVA protein, not a \"cell-associated\" antigen source as specified in the problem statement. The pathways for processing soluble versus particulate/cell-associated antigens can differ.\n\n**Verdict for D:** **Incorrect**. The primary selection criterion (low uptake) is misaligned with the scientific question (defective presentation).\n\nIn conclusion, Option A is the only one that proposes an experimental design that is both specific to the biological question of cross-presentation of cell-associated antigens and includes the necessary rigorous controls to ensure the validity and specificity of the results. The other options either investigate the wrong process (B), bypass the key steps (C), or select for the wrong phenotype (D).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2776556"}]}
