The concept of male achiasmy in *Drosophila* is a known biological fact. The Haldane model is a fundamental mapping function in genetics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data (progeny counts) and assumptions (equal viability, no interference) to derive a unique statistical estimate for the requested parameters. The language is objective and precise. The problem is not trivial, as it requires application of both maximum likelihood estimation and a non-linear mapping function.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be constructed from first principles as requested.\n\nThe female fly has the genotype $X^{ab}/X^{++}$. Her gametes will be of four types. The non-recombinant, or parental, gametes are $X^{ab}$ and $X^{++}$. The recombinant gametes, resulting from a crossover event between loci $A$ and $B$, are $X^{a+}$ and $X^{+b}$.\n\nThe cross is to a male $X^{ab}/Y$. The male progeny inherit their single X chromosome from the mother. Therefore, the phenotype of a male offspring directly reflects the genetic constitution of the maternal gamete he received. We can categorize the observed male progeny counts as follows:\n- Parental progeny received a non-recombinant maternal X chromosome.\n  - $N_{ab} = 855$ (from $X^{ab}$ gamete)\n  - $N_{++} = 845$ (from $X^{++}$ gamete)\n  - Total parental progeny: $N_P = N_{ab} + N_{++} = 855 + 845 = 1700$.\n- Recombinant progeny received a recombinant maternal X chromosome.\n  - $N_{a+} = 160$ (from $X^{a+}$ gamete)\n  - $N_{+b} = 140$ (from $X^{+b}$ gamete)\n  - Total recombinant progeny: $N_R = N_{a+} + N_{+b} = 160 + 140 = 300$.\n\nThe total number of male progeny observed is $N_{Total} = N_P + N_R = 1700 + 300 = 2000$.\n\nThe recombination fraction, denoted by $r$, is the probability that a random gamete produced by the female is of a recombinant type. The process of observing progeny can be modeled as a sequence of $N_{Total}$ independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial results in either a 'recombinant' (with probability $r$) or a 'parental' (with probability $1-r$). The number of observed recombinant progeny, $N_R$, thus follows a binomial distribution: $N_R \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N_{Total}, r)$.\n\nThe likelihood function $L(r)$ gives the probability of observing the data ($N_R$ recombinants in $N_{Total}$ trials) as a function of the parameter $r$.\n$$L(r; N_R, N_{Total}) = \\binom{N_{Total}}{N_R} r^{N_R} (1-r)^{N_{Total} - N_R}$$\nTo find the maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE) of $r$, which we denote $\\hat{r}$, we maximize $L(r)$. It is equivalent and simpler to maximize the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(r) = \\ln L(r)$.\n$$\\ell(r) = \\ln\\left(\\binom{N_{Total}}{N_R}\\right) + N_R \\ln(r) + (N_{Total} - N_R) \\ln(1-r)$$\nWe find the maximum by taking the derivative with respect to $r$ and setting it to zero.\n$$\\frac{d\\ell}{dr} = \\frac{N_R}{r} - \\frac{N_{Total} - N_R}{1-r}$$\nSetting $\\frac{d\\ell}{dr} = 0$:\n$$\\frac{N_R}{\\hat{r}} = \\frac{N_{Total} - N_R}{1-\\hat{r}}$$\n$$N_R(1-\\hat{r}) = \\hat{r}(N_{Total} - N_R)$$\n$$N_R - N_R \\hat{r} = N_{Total} \\hat{r} - N_R \\hat{r}$$\n$$N_R = N_{Total} \\hat{r}$$\nThe MLE for the recombination fraction is therefore the observed proportion of recombinants.\n$$\\hat{r} = \\frac{N_R}{N_{Total}}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\\hat{r} = \\frac{300}{2000} = 0.15$$\n\nNext, we convert this recombination fraction to a map distance using the Haldane model. The Haldane model assumes that crossovers occur along the chromosome according to a Poisson process and that there is no chromatid interference. Let $m$ be the mean number of crossovers in the interval between loci $A$ and $B$ per meiosis. This value $m$ is the map distance in Morgans. The number of crossovers, $k$, is a Poisson-distributed random variable with mean $m$:\n$$P(k; m) = \\frac{\\exp(-m) m^k}{k!}$$\nA recombination event between the two loci is phenotypically observed if an odd number of crossovers ($k = 1, 3, 5, \\dots$) occurs. An even number of crossovers ($k = 0, 2, 4, \\dots$) restores the parental linkage phase. Thus, the recombination fraction $r$ is the probability of an odd number of crossovers.\n$$r = \\sum_{k \\text{ odd}} P(k; m) = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\exp(-m) m^{2j+1}}{(2j+1)!}$$\nThis sum is related to the Taylor series for the hyperbolic sine function, $\\sinh(m) = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{m^{2j+1}}{(2j+1)!}$.\n$$r = \\exp(-m) \\sinh(m)$$\nUsing the definition $\\sinh(m) = \\frac{\\exp(m) - \\exp(-m)}{2}$, we obtain Haldane's mapping function:\n$$r = \\exp(-m) \\left( \\frac{\\exp(m) - \\exp(-m)}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-2m)}{2}$$\nTo find the map distance $m$ from the recombination fraction $r$, we must invert this function.\n$$2r = 1 - \\exp(-2m)$$\n$$\\exp(-2m) = 1 - 2r$$\n$$-2m = \\ln(1 - 2r)$$\n$$m = -\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(1 - 2r)$$\nThe map distance is typically expressed in centimorgans ($cM$), where $1 \\text{ Morgan} = 100 \\, cM$.

All necessary information is provided, and the premises are internally consistent and scientifically sound.\n\nLet the wild-type allele at the X-linked locus be denoted by $A$ and the recessive disease allele by $a$. The corresponding chromosomes are $X^A$ and $X^a$.\nThe frequency of the $X^A$ allele in the population's X chromosome pool is given as $p$.\nThe frequency of the $X^a$ allele in the population's X chromosome pool is given as $q$.\nIt is stated that $p + q = 1$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the population is at equilibrium, which means the allele frequencies on the X chromosomes are the same for both males and females. That is, the frequency of the $X^a$ allele is $q$ in the male population and also $q$ in the female population.\n\nFirst, we determine the incidence of the disease in males.\nMales have an $XY$ genotype. They possess only one X chromosome, which is inherited from their mother. This state is known as hemizygosity. The possible genotypes for males with respect to this locus are $X^A Y$ and $X^a Y$.\nA male will be affected by the disease if he possesses the disease allele, $a$. His genotype must be $X^a Y$.\nThe frequency of the $X^a Y$ genotype in the male population is equal to the frequency of the $X^a$ allele in the gene pool from which they inherit their X chromosome. At equilibrium, this frequency is $q$.\nGiven the assumption of complete penetrance, the incidence of the disease in males, denoted by $I_m$, is equal to the frequency of the affected genotype.\n$$I_m = q$$\n\nNext, we determine the incidence of the disease in females.\nFemales have an $XX$ genotype. They inherit one X chromosome from their mother and one from their father. The inheritance of these alleles is assumed to be independent, following the principle of random mating. The possible genotypes for females are $X^A X^A$, $X^A X^a$, and $X^a X^a$.\nThe frequencies of these genotypes are determined by the allele frequencies in the parental gametes. Under the equilibrium assumption, the frequency of $X^a$ in both the sperm (from fathers) and egg (from mothers) pools is $q$.\nThe frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype, $X^a X^a$, is the product of the probabilities of inheriting an $X^a$ allele from the father and an $X^a$ allele from the mother.\n$$\\text{Frequency}(X^a X^a) = q \\times q = q^2$$\nThe problem states that the disease allele is recessive in females. Therefore, a female will only express the disease phenotype if she is homozygous recessive, i.e., her genotype is $X^a X^a$.\nWith complete penetrance, the incidence of the disease in females, denoted by $I_f$, is equal to the frequency of the $X^a X^a$ genotype.\n$$I_f = q^2$$\n\nFinally, we derive the male-to-female incidence ratio.\nThis ratio is given by $\\frac{I_m}{I_f}$.\nSubstituting the expressions we derived for $I_m$ and $I_f$:\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{I_m}{I_f} = \\frac{q}{q^2}$$\nFor the incidence to be non-zero and the ratio to be well-defined, we assume that the disease allele exists in the population, i.e., $q > 0$.
