It is scientifically grounded in the principles of population genetics, specifically the Wright–Fisher model of genetic drift. It is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters ($H_0$, $N_e$, $t$) and a clearly defined theoretical framework to arrive at a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and requires the application of fundamental theory, thus it is not trivial. The verdict is that the problem is valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds from first principles as required. Let $H_t$ be the expected heterozygosity at generation $t$, defined as the probability that two alleles drawn at random from the population are not identical by descent (IBD). Let $F_t$ be the probability that two randomly drawn alleles are IBD. By definition, these probabilities are complementary:\n$$ H_t = 1 - F_t $$\nThe core task is to establish a recurrence relation for $H_t$ over one generation. We first derive the recurrence for $F_t$. In a diploid Wright–Fisher population of effective size $N_e$, there are $2N_e$ alleles in the gene pool at any generation. Consider two alleles drawn at random from the population at generation $t$. We trace their ancestry back to generation $t-1$.\n\nThere are two mutually exclusive possibilities for the origin of these two alleles:\n1.  They are copies of the *same* parental allele from generation $t-1$. The probability that two randomly chosen alleles descend from the same single ancestral allele in the previous generation is $\\frac{1}{2N_e}$. In this case, they are IBD by definition. The probability contribution to $F_t$ from this path is $\\frac{1}{2N_e} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2N_e}$.\n\n2.  They are copies of *different* parental alleles from generation $t-1$. The probability for this event is the complement of the first case, which is $1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}$. If the two alleles descend from different parental alleles, they are IBD at generation $t$ only if their respective parental alleles in generation $t-1$ were already IBD. The probability of this is, by definition, $F_{t-1}$. The probability contribution to $F_t$ from this path is $\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) F_{t-1}$.\n\nSumming these two probabilities gives the recurrence relation for the probability of identity by descent:\n$$ F_t = \\frac{1}{2N_e} + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) F_{t-1} $$\nTo find the recurrence for heterozygosity, we substitute $F_t = 1 - H_t$ and $F_{t-1} = 1 - H_{t-1}$ into this equation:\n$$ 1 - H_t = \\frac{1}{2N_e} + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) (1 - H_{t-1}) $$\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n$$ 1 - H_t = \\frac{1}{2N_e} + 1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e} - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) H_{t-1} $$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$ 1 - H_t = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) H_{t-1} $$\n$$ -H_t = - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) H_{t-1} $$\n$$ H_t = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) H_{t-1} $$\nThis recurrence relation shows that heterozygosity decays geometrically over generations due to genetic drift. The general solution for $H_t$ after $t$ generations, starting from an initial heterozygosity of $H_0$, is:\n$$ H_t = H_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right)^t $$\nThe problem provides the following values: $H_0 = 0.8$, $N_e = 250$, and $t = 20$. We substitute these into the equation. The decay factor per generation is:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e} = 1 - \\frac{1}{2 \\times 250} = 1 - \\frac{1}{500} = 1 - 0.002 = 0.998 $$\nNow, we calculate the expected heterozygosity after $t = 20$ generations, which we denote as $H_{20}$:\n$$ H_{20} = H_0 \\left(0.998\\right)^{20} = 0.8 \\times \\left(0.998\\right)^{20} $$\nFirst, we evaluate the term $\\left(0.998\\right)^{20}$:\n$$ \\left(0.998\\right)^{20} \\approx 0.960773305 $$\nNext, we multiply this result by the initial heterozygosity $H_0 = 0.8$:\n$$ H_{20} \\approx 0.8 \\times 0.960773305 \\approx 0.768618644 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ H_{20} \\approx 0.7686 $$\nThis is the expected heterozygosity at generation $t=20$ under the specified conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7686}$$", "id": "2801278"}, {"introduction": "While drift causes a steady decline in overall heterozygosity, demographic bottlenecks can have a more dramatic and immediate impact on a population's gene pool.

All provided parameters and assumptions are scientifically sound, consistent, and sufficient for deriving a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe problem requires us to derive the probability that a selectively neutral allele $A$ with initial frequency $p$ is not lost after a single-generation bottleneck of size $N_b$ diploid individuals.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the sampling process. The $2N_b$ gene copies that constitute the bottleneck generation are sampled with replacement (or from an effectively infinite gamete pool) from the pre-bottleneck population. Let $X$ be the random variable representing the number of copies of allele $A$ among the $2N_b$ gene copies in the bottleneck generation.\n\nAs stated in the problem, under the Wright-Fisher assumptions, $X$ follows a binomial distribution. The parameters of this distribution are:\n1.  The number of independent trials, $n$, which is the total number of gene copies sampled. For a diploid population of size $N_b$, this is $n = 2N_b$.\n2.  The probability of success in a single trial, which is the probability of sampling an allele $A$. This is equal to the allele's frequency in the pre-bottleneck population, $p$.\n\nThus, the distribution of $X$ is given by $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)$, where $n=2N_b$. The probability mass function for obtaining exactly $k$ copies of allele $A$ is:\n$$P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\nwhich can be written in terms of $N_b$ as:\n$$P(X=k) = \\binom{2N_b}{k} p^k (1-p)^{2N_b-k}$$\n\nThe allele $A$ is \"not lost\" if its count in the bottleneck generation is at least one. Mathematically, this corresponds to the event $X \\ge 1$. The probability of this event is $P(X \\ge 1)$.\n\nIt is more direct to calculate the probability of the complementary event: the allele $A$ is lost. This occurs if and only if the number of copies of allele $A$ is exactly zero, which is the event $X=0$.\nUsing the binomial probability formula for $k=0$:\n$$P(\\text{loss}) = P(X=0) = \\binom{2N_b}{0} p^0 (1-p)^{2N_b - 0}$$\nSince $\\binom{2N_b}{0} = 1$ and $p^0 = 1$, this simplifies to:\n$$P(\\text{loss}) = (1-p)^{2N_b}$$\n\nThe probability that the allele is *not* lost, $P(\\text{survival})$, is therefore $1$ minus the probability that it is lost:\n$$P(\\text{survival}) = P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(X=0)$, we arrive at the general formula for the probability of allele survival:\n$$P(\\text{survival}) = 1 - (1-p)^{2N_b}$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must evaluate this probability using the given numerical values: the bottleneck census size is $N_b = 25$ individuals, and the initial allele frequency is $p=0.1$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of gene copies in the bottleneck:\n$$n = 2N_b = 2 \\times 25 = 50$$\nNow, we substitute $n=50$ and $p=0.1$ into the survival probability formula:\n$$P(\\text{survival}) = 1 - (1 - 0.1)^{50} = 1 - (0.9)^{50}$$\nWe must now compute the value of $(0.9)^{50}$:\n$$(0.9)^{50} \\approx 0.0051537752$$\nSubstituting this back into our expression for the survival probability gives:\n$$P(\\text{survival}) = 1 - 0.0051537752 \\approx 0.9948462248$$\nThe problem demands the answer be rounded to six significant figures.

However, Assumption 2 contains a significant imprecision. The product $N_e t$ is $20 \\times 1 = 20$ for Scenario I and $100 \\times 5 = 500$ for Scenario II. These values are not \"approximately matched\". The subsequent clause, \"so that cumulative drift... is comparable,\" provides the true intended condition.

This demonstrates that the problem is designed to compare two demographic scenarios with an identical cumulative impact on heterozygosity but differing bottleneck severity. The statement regarding $N_e t$ is formally incorrect but the problem's intent is salvaged by the clarifying clause. The problem is therefore considered valid for analysis, despite the flawed description of the underlying condition.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed by analyzing the two specified metrics of genetic diversity.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe objective is to compare the expected change in (i) heterozygosity and (ii) allelic richness between the two scenarios.\n\n**(i) Change in Heterozygosity ($H$)**\n\nUnder the Wright–Fisher model for a diploid population, the expected heterozygosity $H_t$ in generation $t$ evolves from generation $t-1$ according to the relation:\n$$\nE[H_t] = E[H_{t-1}] \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_{e,t-1}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $N_{e,t-1}$ is the effective population size in generation $t-1$. We are given that drift is negligible outside the reduction window, so we may analyze the change starting from an initial heterozygosity $H_0$ at the beginning of the reduction.\n\nFor **Scenario I**: a single generation with $N_e = 20$.\nThe expected heterozygosity after $1$ generation, $H_I$, is:\n$$\nH_I = H_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2 \\times 20}\\right) = H_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{40}\\right) = 0.975 H_0\n$$\nThe population retains $97.5\\%$ of its initial heterozygosity.\n\nFor **Scenario II**: five consecutive generations with $N_e = 100$.\nThe expected heterozygosity after $5$ generations, $H_{II}$, is the result of applying the process five times:\n$$\nH_{II} = H_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2 \\times 100}\\right)^5 = H_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{200}\\right)^5 = H_0 (0.995)^5\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n(0.995)^5 \\approx 0.97524875...\n$$\nSo, $H_{II} \\approx 0.97525 H_0$. The population retains approximately $97.525\\%$ of its initial heterozygosity.\n\nComparing the two outcomes, $0.975$ and $\\approx 0.97525$ are extremely close. Thus, the expected decline in heterozygosity is approximately equal in the two scenarios. This is a direct consequence of the problem being engineered such that the cumulative drift measure, $\\sum (1/2N_e)$, is identical.\n\n**(ii) Change in Allelic Richness ($A$)**\n\nAllelic richness, the number of distinct alleles, responds differently to demographic changes than heterozygosity. The loss of alleles via genetic drift is an irreversible process (given no mutation) that disproportionately affects low-frequency alleles.\n\nThe probability that a specific allele with frequency $p$ is lost in a single generation of Wright-Fisher sampling (i.e., not sampled among the $2N_e$ gene copies of the next generation) is:\n$$\nP(\\text{loss}) = (1-p)^{2N_e}\n$$\nThis probability is highly sensitive to the value of $N_e$, especially when $N_e$ is small.\n\nLet us compare the risk of allele loss in the two scenarios.\nIn **Scenario I**, the population passes through a single, severe sampling \"sieve\" of size $2N_e = 2 \\times 20 = 40$. Any existing allele must \"pass\" this one test to survive. For a rare allele (small $p$), the probability of loss, $(1-p)^{40}$, is substantial. For example, if an allele has a frequency of $p=0.01$, the probability of it being lost in this single generation is $(0.99)^{40} \\approx 0.669$.\n\nIn **Scenario II**, the population passes through five consecutive, but milder, sieves of size $2N_e = 2 \\times 100 = 200$. In the first generation of the bottleneck, the probability of losing an allele with initial frequency $p$ is $(1-p)^{200}$. For the same allele with $p=0.01$, this probability is $(0.99)^{200} \\approx 0.134$. This is a much lower probability of loss than in Scenario I. An allele is much more likely to survive one generation of sampling of $200$ genes than one generation of sampling of $40$ genes.\n\nEven though the process in Scenario II continues for $5$ generations, the initial severe filter in Scenario I is the dominant factor for the loss of rare alleles. Once an allele is lost, it is gone permanently. The single, extreme reduction in population size to $N_e=20$ creates a high-risk event that is far more likely to purge the rarest variants from the population than the milder, sustained reduction to $N_e=100$.\n\nThis is a fundamental result: for a given total decline in heterozygosity, a short, severe bottleneck causes a greater loss of allelic richness than a longer, milder bottleneck. The loss of allelic richness is more sensitive to the minimum effective population size during the bottleneck, whereas the loss of heterozygosity is sensitive to the harmonic mean of the effective population size over the bottleneck duration.\n\n**Conclusion**: The loss of allelic richness is expected to be greater under Scenario I.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **A. The expected decline in heterozygosity is approximately equal in the two scenarios, but the loss of allelic richness is greater under the single-generation crash to $N_b=20$.**\n  - Our analysis shows that the decline in heterozygosity is indeed approximately equal ($H_I \\approx H_{II}$). Our analysis also shows that the severe, short bottleneck ($N_e=20$) causes a greater loss of alleles than the milder, longer one ($N_e=100$). This statement is fully consistent with our derivation. **Correct**.\n\n- **B. The expected decline in heterozygosity is greater under the single-generation crash to $N_b=20$, whereas the loss of allelic richness is approximately equal between scenarios.**\n  - The first part is incorrect; the decline in heterozygosity is approximately equal. The second part is incorrect; the loss of allelic richness is greater in Scenario I. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C. Both the expected decline in heterozygosity and the loss of allelic richness are approximately equal between the two scenarios.**\n  - The first part is correct, but the second part is incorrect. The dynamics of allele loss are different from those of heterozygosity decay. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. The expected decline in heterozygosity is approximately equal in the two scenarios, but the loss of allelic richness is greater under the $5$-generation reduction to $N_b=100$.**\n  - The first part is correct, but the second part is the opposite of what is expected. The more severe bottleneck (Scenario I) will cause greater allele loss. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2801289"}]}
