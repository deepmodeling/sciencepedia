A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe initial state of the cell is in the $G_1$ phase. Its properties are:\n- Initial DNA content: $D_{0} = 2C$\n- Initial ploidy (chromosome number): $N_{0} = 2n$\n\nBefore either mitosis or meiosis can occur, the cell must pass through the $S$ phase, where its DNA is replicated. After replication, in the $G_2$ phase, the cell has twice the DNA content, but the chromosome number, which is defined by the number of centromeres, remains unchanged. Each chromosome now consists of two sister chromatids.\n- DNA content after $S$ phase: $2 \\times D_{0} = 2 \\times (2C) = 4C$\n- Ploidy after $S$ phase: $2n$\n\n**Analysis of Mitosis**\nMitosis is an equational division. It aims to produce two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell.\n1.  The cell entering mitosis has DNA content $4C$ and ploidy $2n$.\n2.  During anaphase, sister chromatids separate.\n3.  During telophase and cytokinesis, the cell divides into two. The $4C$ DNA content and the separated sister chromatids are partitioned equally between the two daughter cells.\n4.  Each resulting daughter cell receives half of the DNA, so its DNA content is $\\frac{4C}{2} = 2C$.\n5.  Each daughter cell receives a complete diploid set of chromosomes, so its ploidy is $2n$.\n\nThe final state for one daughter cell after mitosis is:\n- Final Mitotic DNA content per cell: $D_{\\mathrm{mit},f} = 2C$\n- Final Mitotic Ploidy per cell: $N_{\\mathrm{mit},f} = 2n$\n\nThe fold changes for mitosis are calculated as the ratio of the final state to the initial $G_{1}$ state.\n- Fold change in DNA content: $f_{\\mathrm{mit},C} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{mit},f}}{D_{0}} = \\frac{2C}{2C} = 1$.\n- Fold change in ploidy: $f_{\\mathrm{mit},n} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{mit},f}}{N_{0}} = \\frac{2n}{2n} = 1$.\n\n**Analysis of Meiosis**\nMeiosis consists of two successive divisions, Meiosis I and Meiosis II, and produces four haploid cells.\n1.  The cell entering Meiosis I has DNA content $4C$ and ploidy $2n$.\n2.  Meiosis I is a reductional division. Homologous chromosomes separate, and the cell divides into two secondary meiocytes.\n    - Each secondary meiocyte receives half of the DNA: $\\frac{4C}{2} = 2C$.\n    - Each secondary meiocyte receives half the number of chromosomes (one from each homologous pair): $\\frac{2n}{2} = 1n$.\n3.  Meiosis II is an equational division. The two secondary meiocytes (each with DNA $2C$ and ploidy $1n$) divide. Sister chromatids separate.\n    - Each of the four final cells (gametes) receives half the DNA of a secondary meiocyte: $\\frac{2C}{2} = 1C$.\n    - The number of chromosomes in each final cell remains $1n$, as the sister chromatids separate.\n    \nThe final state for one gamete after meiosis is:\n- Final Meiotic DNA content per cell: $D_{\\mathrm{mei},f} = 1C$\n- Final Meiotic Ploidy per cell: $N_{\\mathrm{mei},f} = 1n$\n\nThe fold changes for meiosis are calculated as the ratio of the final state (per gamete) to the initial $G_1$ state.\n- Fold change in DNA content: $f_{\\mathrm{mei},C} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{mei},f}}{D_{0}} = \\frac{1C}{2C} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Fold change in ploidy: $f_{\\mathrm{mei},n} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{mei},f}}{N_{0}} = \\frac{1n}{2n} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe computed fold changes are:\n- $f_{\\mathrm{mit},C} = 1$\n- $f_{\\mathrm{mit},n} = 1$\n- $f_{\\mathrm{mei},C} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $f_{\\mathrm{mei},n} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThe required output is the ordered quadruple $(f_{\\mathrm{mit},C}\\; f_{\\mathrm{mit},n}\\; f_{\\mathrm{mei},C}\\; f_{\\mathrm{mei},n})$.

The problem statement is objective and uses precise, unambiguous language. It does not violate any fundamental principles, is not incomplete, and leads to a unique, meaningful solution. It is a substantive problem requiring both biological understanding and mathematical calculation.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts. First, we must deduce the composition of the metaphase plates for mitosis and meiosis I. Second, we must compute the expected difference in the total number of chiasmata between these two stages.\n\nPart 1: Composition of Metaphase Plates.\nThe diploid number of chromosomes is given as $2n = 8$. This means the cell has $n = 4$ pairs of homologous chromosomes.\n\nFor Mitotic Metaphase:\nThe problem states that in mitotic metaphase, duplicated chromosomes align individually at the metaphase plate. Before mitosis, DNA replication occurs, so each of the $8$ chromosomes is duplicated and consists of two sister chromatids.\n- Number of chromosomes: Since the $8$ duplicated chromosomes align individually, there are $8$ centromeres at the metaphase plate. Thus, we count $8$ chromosomes.\n- Number of sister chromatids: Each of the $8$ chromosomes is replicated, so it consists of $2$ sister chromatids. The total number of sister chromatids is $8 \\times 2 = 16$.\n- Number of homologous bivalents: Homologous chromosomes do not pair to form bivalents in mitosis; they align independently. Therefore, the number of homologous bivalents at the metaphase plate is $0$.\n\nFor Meiotic Metaphase I:\nThe problem states that in meiotic metaphase I, homologous chromosomes pair to form bivalents.\n- Number of bivalents: The cell has $n=4$ pairs of homologous chromosomes. These pairs form bivalents. Thus, there are $n=4$ bivalents aligned at the metaphase plate.\n- Total number of sister chromatids: Each bivalent consists of two homologous chromosomes, each of which has been replicated. So, a bivalent contains $4$ chromatids. With $4$ bivalents, the total number of chromatids is $4 \\times 4 = 16$. The question asks for the total number of *sister chromatids*, which is simply the total number of chromatids present, which is $16$.\n\nPart 2: Expected Difference in Total Chiasmata.\nWe are asked to compute $\\Delta$, the expected difference between the total number of chiasmata across the entire meiotic metaphase I plate and the total number of chiasmata across the entire mitotic metaphase plate.\nLet $C_{Meio}$ be the random variable for the total number of chiasmata in meiotic metaphase I, and $C_{Mito}$ be the same for mitotic metaphase. We must compute $\\Delta = E[C_{Meio}] - E[C_{Mito}]$.\n\nFirst, we consider the mitotic plate. The problem explicitly states to \"assume no chiasmata during mitotic metaphase.\" This implies that the number of chiasmata is deterministically zero.\n$$C_{Mito} = 0$$\nTherefore, its expected value is also zero:\n$$E[C_{Mito}] = 0$$\n\nNext, we consider the meiotic plate. There are $n=4$ bivalents. Let $X_i$ be the number of chiasmata on the $i$-th bivalent, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The total number of chiasmata is the sum over all bivalents:\n$$C_{Meio} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} X_i$$\nBy linearity of expectation, the expected total number of chiasmata is:\n$$E[C_{Meio}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{4} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} E[X_i]$$\nThe problem states that bivalents are independent with respect to crossover counts, and the model for each is identical. Thus, $E[X_i]$ is the same for all $i$. Let this common expectation be $E[X]$.\n$$E[C_{Meio}] = 4 E[X]$$\nTo find $E[X]$, we use the given statistical model. The number of chiasmata $X$ for a single bivalent follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda = 1.5$, conditioned on the number of chiasmata being at least $1$. Let $Y$ be a random variable following a standard Poisson distribution, $Y \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$, with probability mass function $P(Y=k) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda)\\lambda^k}{k!}$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}$.\nThe distribution of $X$ is that of $Y$ given $Y \\ge 1$. The probability of this condition is:\n$$P(Y \\ge 1) = 1 - P(Y=0) = 1 - \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda)\\lambda^0}{0!} = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nThe expected value of the conditioned variable $X$ is given by:\n$$E[X] = E[Y | Y \\ge 1] = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k \\cdot P(Y=k | Y \\ge 1)$$\n$$E[X] = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k \\cdot \\frac{P(Y=k)}{P(Y \\ge 1)} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k \\cdot P(Y=k)$$\nThe sum is related to the expectation of $Y$. The expectation of the unconditioned Poisson variable $Y$ is $E[Y] = \\lambda$.\n$$E[Y] = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} k \\cdot P(Y=k) = 0 \\cdot P(Y=0) + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k \\cdot P(Y=k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k \\cdot P(Y=k)$$\nTherefore, $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k \\cdot P(Y=k) = \\lambda$. Substituting this back into the expression for $E[X]$:\n$$E[X] = \\frac{\\lambda}{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)}$$\nNow, we substitute the given value $\\lambda = 1.5$:\n$$E[X] = \\frac{1.5}{1 - \\exp(-1.5)}$$\nThe total expected number of chiasmata in meiosis I is:\n$$E[C_{Meio}] = 4 E[X] = 4 \\left( \\frac{1.5}{1 - \\exp(-1.5)} \\right) = \\frac{6}{1 - \\exp(-1.5)}$$\nFinally, we compute the expected difference $\\Delta$:\n$$\\Delta = E[C_{Meio}] - E[C_{Mito}] = \\frac{6}{1 - \\exp(-1.5)} - 0 = \\frac{6}{1 - \\exp(-1.5)}$$\nWe now calculate the numerical value.\n$$\\exp(-1.5) \\approx 0.22313016$$\n$$1 - \\exp(-1.5) \\approx 1 - 0.22313016 = 0.77686984$$\n$$\\Delta \\approx \\frac{6}{0.77686984} \\approx 7.723222$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures gives $7.723$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.723}$$", "id": "2788043"}, {"introduction": "The distinct mechanics of mitosis and meiosis have profound consequences for heredity and genetic variation.

It presents a formalizable problem in fundamental genetics, free of contradiction, ambiguity, or factual error. The premises provided are standard idealizations used in classical genetics to elucidate the distinct outcomes of meiosis and mitosis. I will therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe task is to determine the expected frequency distributions of haplotypes for two linked loci, $A$ and $B$, resulting from meiosis and mitosis in a double heterozygote individual with genotype $AB/ab$.\n\nPart 1: Derivation for Meiosis\n\nThe initial diploid cell has the genotype $AB/ab$, meaning one homologous chromosome carries the haplotype $AB$ and the other carries the haplotype $ab$. Before meiosis begins, during the S phase, DNA replication occurs. This results in a cell where each chromosome consists of two identical sister chromatids. The bivalent formed during prophase I will therefore consist of four chromatids in total: two with the $AB$ haplotype and two with the $ab$ haplotype.\n\nThe problem defines the recombination fraction, $r$, as the long-run fraction of gametes that carry recombinant haplotypes. The parental haplotypes are those present in the parent cell, which are $AB$ and $ab$. The recombinant haplotypes are those formed by crossing over between the non-sister chromatids, resulting in new combinations, which are $Ab$ and $aB$.\n\nBy definition, the total frequency of recombinant gametes is $r$.\n$$f_{\\text{meiosis}}(Ab) + f_{\\text{meiosis}}(aB) = r$$\nA single crossover event is a symmetric exchange between two non-sister chromatids. This process produces the two recombinant types, $Ab$ and $aB$, in equal numbers. As there is no segregation distortion and equal viability, their frequencies in the final gamete pool must be equal.\n$$f_{\\text{meiosis}}(Ab) = f_{\\text{meiosis}}(aB)$$\nSubstituting this into the previous equation gives:\n$$2 \\cdot f_{\\text{meiosis}}(Ab) = r \\implies f_{\\text{meiosis}}(Ab) = \\frac{r}{2}$$\nAnd consequently:\n$$f_{\\text{meiosis}}(aB) = \\frac{r}{2}$$\n\nThe sum of all haplotype frequencies must equal $1$:\n$$f_{\\text{meiosis}}(AB) + f_{\\text{meiosis}}(Ab) + f_{\\text{meiosis}}(aB) + f_{\\text{meiosis}}(ab) = 1$$\nThe total frequency of parental gametes is therefore $1 - r$.\n$$f_{\\text{meiosis}}(AB) + f_{\\text{meiosis}}(ab) = 1 - r$$\nThe two parental haplotypes, $AB$ and $ab$, are also expected to be produced in equal frequencies. This is because meiotic events without a crossover between the loci will produce only $AB$ and $ab$ gametes in equal proportion. Meiotic events with a crossover will also produce the two parental types (from the non-participating chromatids) in equal proportion. Thus, by symmetry across all meiotic events, their total frequencies must be equal.\n$$f_{\\text{meiosis}}(AB) = f_{\\text{meiosis}}(ab)$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for parental frequencies gives:\n$$2 \\cdot f_{\\text{meiosis}}(AB) = 1 - r \\implies f_{\\text{meiosis}}(AB) = \\frac{1-r}{2}$$\nAnd consequently:\n$$f_{\\text{meiosis}}(ab) = \\frac{1-r}{2}$$\nThe expected haplotype frequency vector for meiotic products is therefore:\n$$[f_{\\text{meiosis}}(AB),\\;f_{\\text{meiosis}}(Ab),\\;f_{\\text{meiosis}}(aB),\\;f_{\\text{meiosis}}(ab)] = \\left[ \\frac{1-r}{2},\\; \\frac{r}{2},\\; \\frac{r}{2},\\; \\frac{1-r}{2} \\right]$$\n\nPart 2: Derivation for Mitosis\n\nThe starting point is the same diploid cell with genotype $AB/ab$. Before mitosis, DNA replication produces a cell with four chromatids: two sister chromatids with the $AB$ haplotype and two sister chromatids with the $ab$ haplotype.\n\nThe problem states that mitosis is defined as equational segregation of sister chromatids without pairing of homologs and without homologous recombination. This means that during anaphase, the sister chromatids separate, one $AB$ and one $ab$ chromatid moving to one pole, and the other pair of $AB$ and $ab$ chromatids moving to the opposing pole. Cytokinesis then produces two daughter cells, each genetically identical to the parent cell, with the genotype $AB/ab$.\n\nThe task requires us to find the haplotype frequencies by \"sampling a single chromatid uniformly at random from the pool of chromatids across a very large number of daughter cells immediately after cytokinesis\". Immediately after cytokinesis, the daughter cells are in the G1 phase. Each cell contains one chromosome with the $AB$ haplotype and one chromosome with the $ab$ haplotype.\n\nIn a large population of mitotically produced daughter cells, the pool of haplotypes consists exclusively of $AB$ and $ab$. Because each cell has exactly one of each, these two haplotypes exist in a $1:1$ ratio in the total population. The probability of sampling an $AB$ haplotype is therefore $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of sampling an $ab$ haplotype is also $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSince the problem explicitly states to ignore mitotic recombination, no $Ab$ or $aB$ haplotypes are generated. Their frequencies are therefore $0$. The recombination fraction $r$ is a parameter specific to meiosis and has no relevance to this idealized mitotic process.\n\nThe expected haplotype frequency vector for mitotic products is:\n$$f_{\\text{mitosis}}(AB) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$f_{\\text{mitosis}}(Ab) = 0$$\n$$f_{\\text{mitosis}}(aB) = 0$$\n$$f_{\\text{mitosis}}(ab) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe vector is:\n$$[f_{\\text{mitosis}}(AB),\\;f_{\\text{mitosis}}(Ab),\\;f_{\\text{mitosis}}(aB),\\;f_{\\text{mitosis}}(ab)] = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2},\\; 0,\\; 0,\\; \\frac{1}{2} \\right]$$\n\nCombining both results into the specified final format gives the $8$-element row matrix.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1-r}{2} & \\frac{r}{2} & \\frac{r}{2} & \\frac{1-r}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2787986"}]}
