{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The first step in studying speciation is to identify precisely where in the life cycle reproductive isolation occurs. This exercise challenges you to act as an evolutionary biologist, interpreting experimental data to distinguish between premating, postmating prezygotic, and postzygotic barriers. Mastering this skill is fundamental for designing effective experiments and correctly classifying the mechanisms that drive the divergence of species from real-world observations [@problem_id:2833335].", "problem": "Two species pairs are studied to identify the stage(s) at which reproductive isolation acts. Use as foundational base the Biological Species Concept (BSC), which defines species by reproductive isolation, and the core classification that barriers can act before formation of a zygote (prezygotic) or after a zygote forms (postzygotic). Within prezygotic barriers, distinguish between those that prevent mating altogether (premating prezygotic) and those that occur after mating but before fertilization (postmating prezygotic). A zygote is considered to have formed once syngamy produces a diploid nucleus; any barrier that manifests only after this point is postzygotic. Evaluate the evidence below strictly by asking whether mating occurs, whether fertilization occurs, and whether hybrid development or fertility is compromised after a zygote forms.\n\nCase I (field crickets): In no-choice laboratory assays with $n = 60$ heterospecific pairs, copulation occurred in $70\\%$ of trials, and spermathecal dissections confirmed heterospecific sperm storage in $>95\\%$ of copulating females. Females laid a mean of $120$ eggs each (not different from conspecific matings; $P > 0.05$). However, cleavage was detected in $<1\\%$ of eggs. Fluorescent staining of egg envelopes showed no heterospecific sperm nuclei inside eggs, and conspecific controls processed in parallel showed $>90\\%$ fertilization. Mixed-mating assays in which a female first mated heterospecifically and then conspecifically yielded normal fertilization rates, indicating that female fecundity and egg quality were intact.\n\nCase II (sympatric frogs): In the field, male advertisement calls are largely nonoverlapping in diel timing, and female phonotaxis assays show approach to conspecific calls in $>90\\%$ of trials and to heterospecific calls in $<5\\%$ of trials ($n = 40$ per treatment). Heterospecific amplexus is rarely observed. When gametes are obtained by hormone-induced spawning and crossed in vitro, reciprocal heterospecific fertilizations yield normal cleavage, and $F_1$ tadpoles survive to adulthood with no apparent reduction in fertility relative to conspecifics in laboratory tests.\n\nCase III (Drosophila): In $n = 50$ no-choice heterospecific pairings, copulation occurred in $80\\%$ of trials. Eggs laid after heterospecific matings show normal fertilization envelopes and early cleavage, and karyotyping of early embryos confirms syngamy. Nevertheless, $F_1$ survival to adulthood is reduced to $40\\%$ of conspecific controls, and surviving $F_1$ males are sterile while $F_1$ females are partially fertile. Backcrosses and $F_2$ progeny exhibit additional inviability during late larval and pupal stages.\n\nQuestion: For each case, choose the single barrier category best supported as the strongest isolating stage given the evidence: premating prezygotic, postmating prezygotic, or postzygotic. Select the option that lists the correct category for Case I, Case II, and Case III, respectively.\n\nA) Case I: premating prezygotic; Case II: postmating prezygotic; Case III: postzygotic\n\nB) Case I: postmating prezygotic; Case II: premating prezygotic; Case III: postzygotic\n\nC) Case I: postzygotic; Case II: premating prezygotic; Case III: postmating prezygotic\n\nD) Case I: premating prezygotic; Case II: postzygotic; Case III: postmating prezygotic", "solution": "The solution requires applying the definitions of reproductive barriers to the evidence presented in each case.\n\n**Case I (field crickets):** Mating and sperm transfer occur, but fertilization fails. The evidence (\"cleavage was detected in $<1\\%$ of eggs,\" \"no heterospecific sperm nuclei inside eggs\") points to a barrier that acts after mating but before the zygote forms. This is **postmating prezygotic** isolation.\n\n**Case II (sympatric frogs):** Mating in the wild is rare due to differences in mating call timing and strong female preference for conspecific calls. Since lab-created hybrids are viable and fertile, the primary barrier prevents mating from occurring. This is **premating prezygotic** isolation.\n\n**Case III (Drosophila):** Mating and fertilization (syngamy) occur, forming a hybrid zygote. The subsequent reduced survival and sterility of hybrids ($F_1$ and $F_2$) are by definition **postzygotic** barriers.\n\nThe correct classification for Cases I, II, and III is therefore: Postmating prezygotic, Premating prezygotic, and Postzygotic. This corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2833335"}, {"introduction": "Speciation rarely results from a single, absolute barrier; it is typically the result of multiple, imperfect barriers acting sequentially to reduce gene flow. This practice introduces the standard multiplicative model for quantifying total reproductive isolation, where the remaining potential for gene flow that passes one barrier is then filtered by the next. By applying this quantitative framework, you move from a qualitative list of barriers to a precise measurement of their combined impact, a critical step for comparing the strength of isolation among different species pairs [@problem_id:2833416].", "problem": "Two incipient species exhibit multiple barriers to gene flow acting sequentially across the life cycle. Use the following core definitions as the starting point: reproductive isolation is the proportional reduction in realized gene flow between populations relative to a baseline with no barriers; prezygotic barriers act before zygote formation to reduce mating or fertilization; postzygotic barriers act after zygote formation to reduce viability or fertility. When barriers act in sequence and are independent in their effects, the realized gene flow is given by the baseline gene flow multiplied by the fraction that passes each barrier in turn.\n\nConsider a cross between these two species with three measured barrier strengths: a prezygotic mating probability reduction of $0.4$ (interpreted as the proportional reduction in the probability that a mating occurs, relative to random mating), a postzygotic hybrid inviability of $0.3$ (interpreted as the proportional reduction in survival from zygote to reproductive adult, conditional on a mating occurring), and a postzygotic hybrid sterility of $0.5$ (interpreted as the proportional reduction in reproductive output of surviving hybrids, conditional on surviving to adulthood). Assume multiplicative independence of these barriers across their sequential stages.\n\nStarting from the definitions above and the basic rules of probabilities for independent sequential filters, derive an expression for the total reproductive isolation and compute its value using the given barrier strengths. Express the total reproductive isolation as a single decimal between $0$ and $1$.

This problem delves into the foundational Dobzhansky-Muller model, the genetic cornerstone for understanding how such incompatibilities arise from negative epistatic interactions. By deriving the frequency of incompatible genotypes in a second-generation hybrid population, you will gain a mechanistic understanding of how alleles that are harmless on their own genetic backgrounds can cause fitness loss when brought together through hybridization [@problem_id:2833429].", "problem": "In a two-locus Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibility (DMI) model of postzygotic isolation, consider two loci, denoted $A$ and $B$, each with an ancestral allele ($a$ and $b$) and a derived allele ($A$ and $B$).
