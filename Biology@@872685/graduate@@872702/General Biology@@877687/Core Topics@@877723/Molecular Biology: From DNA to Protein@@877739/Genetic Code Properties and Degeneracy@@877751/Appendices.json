The foundation of this problem lies in the Central Dogma of molecular biology, which describes the flow of genetic information from deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to ribonucleic acid (RNA) to protein. The standard genetic code is the set of rules by which the sequence of nucleotide triplets, or codons, in an RNA molecule is translated into the sequence of amino acids comprising a protein. A mutation is defined as synonymous if it results in a new codon that codes for the same amino acid as the original codon. The degeneracy of the genetic code, where multiple codons specify the same amino acid, is what makes synonymous mutations possible.\n\nWe are tasked with calculating the conditional probability $P_k = P(S | E_k)$ for each codon position $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, where $S$ is the event that a random point mutation is synonymous, and $E_k$ is the event that the mutation occurs at position $k$.\n\nThe problem states a specific probabilistic model for a random point mutation:\n1.  A sense codon is chosen uniformly at random from the set of $N_{codon} = 61$ sense codons.\n2.  A position $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ is chosen uniformly at random.\n3.  The nucleotide at position $k$ is replaced by one of the other $3$ possible nucleotides, chosen uniformly at random.\n\nGiven that a mutation occurs at a specific position $k$, the sample space of mutational events consists of all possible single-nucleotide changes at that position, across all $61$ initial sense codons. For a fixed position $k$, there are $61$ possible starting codons, and for each codon, there are $3$ possible nucleotide substitutions. Thus, the total number of distinct mutational outcomes for position $k$ is $N_{total,k} = 61 \\times 3 = 183$. Under the given assumptions, each of these $183$ outcomes is equally likely.\n\nThe conditional probability $P_k$ is the ratio of the number of synonymous mutation outcomes at position $k$, denoted $N_{syn, k}$, to the total number of possible mutation outcomes at that position, $N_{total, k}$.\n$$P_k = \\frac{N_{syn, k}}{N_{total, k}} = \\frac{N_{syn, k}}{183}$$\nOur task reduces to the systematic enumeration of $N_{syn, 1}$, $N_{syn, 2}$, and $N_{syn, 3}$ by direct inspection of the standard RNA codon table. A mutation to a stop codon is counted as non-synonymous.\n\n**Calculation for Position $k=3$ (Third Position)**\n\nWe will count the number of synonymous mutations, $N_{syn, 3}$, by analyzing the genetic code table. A synonymous mutation at the third position occurs if a change from $N_1N_2N_3$ to $N_1N_2N'_3$ results in the same amino acid. We sum the number of such events over all $61$ sense codons.\n\n-   Boxes with $4$-fold degeneracy (all $4$ codons specify the same amino acid): Serine (UCx), Proline (CCx), Threonine (ACx), Alanine (GCx), Valine (GUx), Glycine (GGx), Leucine (CUx), and Arginine (CGx). There are $8$ such boxes. For each of the $4$ codons in a box, any of the $3$ possible changes in the third position results in a synonymous codon. Thus, each box contributes $4 \\times 3 = 12$ synonymous mutations. Total: $8 \\times 12 = 96$.\n-   Box UUx (Phe, Leu): UUU(Phe) $\\leftrightarrow$ UUC(Phe) (2 mutations). UUA(Leu) $\\leftrightarrow$ UUG(Leu) (2 mutations). Total: $4$.\n-   Box UAx (Tyr, Stop): UAU(Tyr) $\\leftrightarrow$ UAC(Tyr) (2 mutations). UAA and UAG are stop codons and not in the initial set. Total: $2$.\n-   Box UGx (Cys, Trp, Stop): UGU(Cys) $\\leftrightarrow$ UGC(Cys) (2 mutations). UGG(Trp) has $0$ synonymous changes at this position. UGA is a stop codon. Total: $2$.\n-   Box CAx (His, Gln): CAU(His) $\\leftrightarrow$ CAC(His) (2 mutations). CAA(Gln) $\\leftrightarrow$ CAG(Gln) (2 mutations). Total: $4$.\n-   Box AUx (Ile, Met): AUU, AUC, AUA all code for Isoleucine. From each of these $3$ codons, there are $2$ synonymous changes to the other two. From AUG(Met), there are $0$. Total: $3 \\times 2 + 0 = 6$.\n-   Box AAx (Asn, Lys): AAU(Asn) $\\leftrightarrow$ AAC(Asn) (2 mutations). AAA(Lys) $\\leftrightarrow$ AAG(Lys) (2 mutations). Total: $4$.\n-   Box AGx (Ser, Arg): AGU(Ser) $\\leftrightarrow$ AGC(Ser) (2 mutations). AGA(Arg) $\\leftrightarrow$ AGG(Arg) (2 mutations).

We must find all such pairs in the genetic code.\n-   **Leucine (Leu)**: The codons UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG all code for Leucine. The pairs that differ only in the first position are (UUA, CUA) and (UUG, CUG).\n    -   The mutation UUA $\\to$ CUA is synonymous.\n    -   The mutation CUA $\\to$ UUA is synonymous.\n    -   The mutation UUG $\\to$ CUG is synonymous.\n    -   The mutation CUG $\\to$ UUG is synonymous.\n    This gives a total of $4$ synonymous mutations for Leucine.\n-   **Arginine (Arg)**: The codons CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, AGG all code for Arginine. The pairs that differ only in the first position are (CGA, AGA) and (CGG, AGG).\n    -   The mutation CGA $\\to$ AGA is synonymous.\n    -   The mutation AGA $\\to$ CGA is synonymous.\n    -   The mutation CGG $\\to$ AGG is synonymous.\n    -   The mutation AGG $\\to$ CGG is synonymous.\n    This gives a total of $4$ synonymous mutations for Arginine.\n-   **Serine (Ser)**: The codons UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG, AGU, AGC all code for Serine. There are no pairs of Serine codons that differ only at the first position.\n\nNo other amino acids are encoded by codons that differ only in their first nucleotide. Therefore, the total number of synonymous mutations at the first position is:\n$N_{syn, 1} = 4 (\\text{from Leu}) + 4 (\\text{from Arg}) = 8$.\n\nThe conditional probability is:\n$$P_1 = \\frac{N_{syn, 1}}{183} = \\frac{8}{183}$$\nSince $183 = 3 \\times 61$, and $8$ is not divisible by $3$ or $61$, this fraction is irreducible.\n\n**Calculation for Position $k=2$ (Second Position)**\n\nA synonymous mutation at the second position requires that two codons, $XN_2Z$ and $XN'_2Z$, code for the same amino acid. A systematic inspection of the standard genetic code table reveals that for any fixed first base ($X$) and third base ($Z$), changing the second base ($N_2$) always results in a different amino acid or a stop codon.\nFor example, for $X=U$ and $Z=U$, the codons are UUU (Phe), UCU (Ser), UAU (Tyr), and UGU (Cys). All four amino acids are different. This pattern holds true for all $16$ combinations of $X$ and $Z$. There are no instances where changing only the second nucleotide of a sense codon results in a codon for the same amino acid.\n\nTherefore, the number of synonymous mutations at the second position is:\n$N_{syn, 2} = 0$.\n\nThe conditional probability is:\n$$P_2 = \\frac{N_{syn, 2}}{183} = \\frac{0}{183} = 0$$\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe conditional probabilities of a synonymous mutation, given the position of the mutation, are:\n-   For position $k=1$: $P_1 = \\frac{8}{183}$\n-   For position $k=2$: $P_2 = 0$\n-   For position $k=3$: $P_3 = \\frac{42}{61}$\n\nThese results quantify the well-known property of the genetic code's structure: degeneracy is concentrated almost entirely at the third codon position, with a minor contribution from the first position and virtually none from the second.

Let us attempt to construct a cover of size $2$.\n- Consider the most powerful tRNA, the one with anticodon $5'$-$I$, which provides the recognition set $T_I = \\{U, C, A\\}$.\n- After selecting this tRNA, the only remaining codon base to be recognized is $G$.\n- To recognize $G$, we can select a tRNA that covers it. From $\\mathcal{F}_b$, the subset $T_C = \\{G\\}$ (from the tRNA with a $5'$-$C$ anticodon) will suffice.\n\n$3$. The combination of a tRNA with a $5'$-$I$ anticodon and a tRNA with a $5'$-$C$ anticodon provides a total recognition set of:\n$$T_I \\cup T_C = \\{U, C, A\\} \\cup \\{G\\} = \\{U, C, A, G\\} = S$$\nThis combination of $2$ tRNA species is sufficient to decode the entire fourfold box. Since we established that $n_{\\text{with }I} > 1$, the minimal number must be $2$.\nThus, $n_{\\text{with }I} = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is the pair of minimal numbers $(n_{\\text{no }I}, n_{\\text{with }I})$. Based on the analysis, both scenarios require a minimum of $2$ tRNA species.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2800907"}]}
