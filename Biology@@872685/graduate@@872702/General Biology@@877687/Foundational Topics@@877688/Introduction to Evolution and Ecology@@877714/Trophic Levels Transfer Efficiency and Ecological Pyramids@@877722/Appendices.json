Both have units of biomass per unit time.\n\nThe production-to-biomass turnover rate, denoted by $r$, is defined as the ratio of production to biomass:\n$$r = \\frac{P}{B}$$\nFrom this fundamental definition, we can express production in terms of biomass and the turnover rate for each trophic level:\nFor producers:\n$$P_P = r_P B_P$$\nFor herbivores:\n$$P_H = r_H B_H$$\n\nThe problem defines the trophic transfer efficiency, $E_t$, as the ratio of production at the herbivore level to the production at the producer level. This represents the fraction of energy or biomass that is successfully converted into new biomass at the next trophic level. At steady state, this relationship is:\n$$P_H = E_t P_P$$\n\nThe objective is to find the ratio of herbivore biomass to producer biomass, $\\frac{B_H}{B_P}$. We can derive this by substituting the expressions for $P_P$ and $P_H$ into the trophic transfer equation:\n$$(r_H B_H) = E_t (r_P B_P)$$\nTo isolate the desired biomass ratio, we rearrange the equation algebraically:\n$$\\frac{B_H}{B_P} = E_t \\left(\\frac{r_P}{r_H}\\right)$$\nThis is the general formula for the biomass ratio as a function of the trophic transfer efficiency and the turnover rates of the two levels.\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the two specified systems using the given numerical values.\n\n**1.

This value, being less than $1$, corresponds to a classic \"upright\" pyramid of biomass, where the producer biomass is greater than the herbivore biomass.\n\n**2. Open-Ocean Pelagic System**\nThe given parameters are:\n- $E_t = 0.1$\n- $r_{P, \\text{aq}} = 300\\ \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$\n- $r_{H, \\text{aq}} = 5\\ \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\\left(\\frac{B_H}{B_P}\\right)_{\\text{aq}} = 0.1 \\times \\frac{300\\ \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}}{5\\ \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}} = 0.1 \\times 60 = 6$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the result is $6.00$. This value, being greater than $1$, demonstrates the phenomenon of an \"inverted\" pyramid of biomass. The biomass of herbivores ($B_H$) is $6$ times greater than the biomass of producers ($B_P$). This is possible because the producers (phytoplankton) have an extremely high turnover rate, meaning a small standing stock of biomass can support a much larger biomass of consumers due to its rapid production and consumption. The pyramid of production, however, remains upright, as $P_H = 0.1 P_P$.\n\nThe two numerical results for the herbivore-to-producer biomass ratio, in the requested order of terrestrial and aquatic, are $0.200$ and $6.00$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.200  6.00\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2846846"}, {"introduction": "To understand the dynamics of entire ecosystems, ecologists translate the principles of energy flow into mathematical models.
