It describes the standard Lotka-Volterra competition model, a fundamental concept in theoretical ecology. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary parameters and a clear set of tasks. The language is precise and uses standard terminology. There are no scientific violations, contradictions, or ambiguities. The problem is a standard, non-trivial exercise in mathematical biology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe dynamics of the two-species competitive system are described by the Lotka-Volterra competition equations, which, based on the principle of additive crowding, are:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_1}{dt} = r_1 N_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{N_1 + \\alpha_{12} N_2}{K_1}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dN_2}{dt} = r_2 N_2 \\left(1 - \\frac{N_2 + \\alpha_{21} N_1}{K_2}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $N_1$ and $N_2$ are the population sizes, $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the intrinsic growth rates, $K_1$ and $K_2$ are the carrying capacities, and $\\alpha_{12}$ and $\\alpha_{21}$ are the competition coefficients.\n\nThe zero-growth isoclines are found by setting the growth rates to zero, i.e., $\\frac{dN_1}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dN_2}{dt} = 0$. For a non-trivial equilibrium (where $N_1 \\neq 0$ and $N_2 \\neq 0$), this requires the terms in the parentheses to be zero.\n\nFor species $1$, the isocline is given by:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{N_1 + \\alpha_{12} N_2}{K_1} = 0 \\implies N_1 + \\alpha_{12} N_2 = K_1\n$$\nSolving for $N_1$ as a function of $N_2$, we get the equation for the species $1$ isocline:\n$$\nN_1 = K_1 - \\alpha_{12} N_2\n$$\nThis is a line that intercepts the $N_1$-axis at $N_1 = K_1$ and the $N_2$-axis at $N_2 = K_1 / \\alpha_{12}$.\n\nFor species $2$, the isocline is given by:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{N_2 + \\alpha_{21} N_1}{K_2} = 0 \\implies N_2 + \\alpha_{21} N_1 = K_2\n$$\nSolving for $N_2$ as a function of $N_1$, we get the equation for the species $2$ isocline:\n$$\nN_2 = K_2 - \\alpha_{21} N_1\n$$\nThis is a line that intercepts the $N_2$-axis at $N_2 = K_2$ and the $N_1$-axis at $N_1 = K_2 / \\alpha_{21}$.\n\nThe internal coexistence equilibrium, denoted $(N_1^{\\ast}, N_2^{\\ast})$, is the point where both populations have zero growth, which corresponds to the intersection of the two isoclines. We solve the following system of linear equations:\n$$\nN_1^{\\ast} + \\alpha_{12} N_2^{\\ast} = K_1\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{21} N_1^{\\ast} + N_2^{\\ast} = K_2\n$$\nSolving this system yields the equilibrium abundances:\n$$\nN_1^{\\ast} = \\frac{K_1 - \\alpha_{12} K_2}{1 - \\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}}\n$$\n$$\nN_2^{\\ast} = \\frac{K_2 - \\alpha_{21} K_1}{1 - \\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}}\n$$\nFor this equilibrium to be biologically meaningful (positive, i.e., $N_1^{\\ast}  0$ and $N_2^{\\ast}  0$) and locally stable, two conditions must be met. Local stability analysis of the Jacobian matrix shows that the equilibrium is stable if and only if $1 - \\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}  0$, which is equivalent to $\\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}  1$. Given this condition, for the numerators to also be positive to ensure $N_1^{\\ast}, N_2^{\\ast}  0$, we require $K_1 - \\alpha_{12} K_2  0$ and $K_2 - \\alpha_{21} K_1  0$.\n\nThese conditions for stable coexistence can be interpreted graphically by comparing the intercepts of the isoclines:\n1. $K_1 - \\alpha_{12} K_2  0 \\implies K_1  \\alpha_{12} K_2 \\implies K_1/\\alpha_{12}  K_2$. This means the $N_2$-intercept of species $1$'s isocline is above the $N_2$-intercept of species $2$'s isocline.\n2. $K_2 - \\alpha_{21} K_1  0 \\implies K_2  \\alpha_{21} K_1 \\implies K_2/\\alpha_{21}  K_1$. This means the $N_1$-intercept of species $2$'s isocline is to the right of the $N_1$-intercept of species $1$'s isocline.\n\nIn summary, stable coexistence occurs when each species inhibits its own growth more strongly than it inhibits the other's growth. Graphically, this means the isoclines cross, with the species $1$ isocline having a higher $N_2$-intercept and the species $2$ isocline having a higher $N_1$-intercept. Other configurations of the intercepts lead to competitive exclusion or bistability.\n\nNow we apply this framework to the given parameter set: $r_1 = 1.0$, $r_2 = 0.8$, $K_1 = 100$, $K_2 = 120$, $\\alpha_{12} = 0.6$, and $\\alpha_{21} = 0.7$. Note that the growth rates $r_1$ and $r_2$ affect the speed at which the system approaches equilibrium but not the position or stability of the equilibrium itself.\n\nFirst, we compute the isocline intercepts:\n- Species $1$ isocline ($N_1 + 0.6 N_2 = 100$):\n  - $N_1$-intercept: $K_1 = 100$.\n  - $N_2$-intercept: $K_1/\\alpha_{12} = 100 / 0.6 \\approx 166.67$.\n- Species $2$ isocline ($N_2 + 0.7 N_1 = 120$):\n  - $N_1$-intercept: $K_2/\\alpha_{21} = 120 / 0.7 \\approx 171.43$.\n  - $N_2$-intercept: $K_2 = 120$.\n\nNext, we compare the intercepts to determine the outcome:\n- On the $N_1$-axis, the intercept for species $2$'s isocline ($K_2/\\alpha_{21} \\approx 171.43$) is greater than for species $1$'s isocline ($K_1 = 100$).\n- On the $N_2$-axis, the intercept for species $1$'s isocline ($K_1/\\alpha_{12} \\approx 166.67$) is greater than for species $2$'s isocline ($K_2 = 120$).\n\nThis configuration ($K_2/\\alpha_{21}  K_1$ and $K_1/\\alpha_{12}  K_2$) corresponds to the case of stable coexistence. The conditions $K_1  \\alpha_{12}K_2$ and $K_2  \\alpha_{21}K_1$ are satisfied, implying a positive and stable internal equilibrium exists. A check of the competition coefficients product, $\\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21} = (0.6)(0.7) = 0.42  1$, confirms the stability.\n\nFinally, we compute the coordinates of this stable coexistence equilibrium $(N_1^{\\ast}, N_2^{\\ast})$:\n$$\nN_1^{\\ast} = \\frac{K_1 - \\alpha_{12} K_2}{1 - \\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}} = \\frac{100 - (0.6)(120)}{1 - (0.6)(0.7)} = \\frac{100 - 72}{1 - 0.42} = \\frac{28}{0.58} \\approx 48.27586 \\ldots\n$$\n$$\nN_2^{\\ast} = \\frac{K_2 - \\alpha_{21} K_1}{1 - \\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}} = \\frac{120 - (0.7)(100)}{1 - (0.6)(0.7)} = \\frac{120 - 70}{1 - 0.42} = \\frac{50}{0.58} \\approx 86.20689 \\ldots\n$$\nRounding these values to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nN_1^{\\ast} \\approx 48.28\n$$\n$$\nN_2^{\\ast} \\approx 86.21\n$$\nThe long-term outcome is a stable coexistence equilibrium at approximately $(48.28, 86.21)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n48.28  86.21\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2810620"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the graphical intuition from the previous exercise, this practice [@problem_id:2810585] introduces the formal mathematical framework for assessing the stability of an equilibrium.

The coexistence equilibrium is the non-trivial case where both species persist, meaning $N_1^{*}  0$ and $N_2^{*}  0$. For this to be true, the terms inside the parentheses must equal zero. This gives the system of linear equations known as the zero-growth isoclines:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{N_1^{*} + \\alpha_{12} N_2^{*}}{K_1} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad N_1^{*} + \\alpha_{12} N_2^{*} = K_1\n$$\n$$\n1 - \\frac{N_2^{*} + \\alpha_{21} N_1^{*}}{K_2} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\alpha_{21} N_1^{*} + N_2^{*} = K_2\n$$\nWe solve this system for $N_1^{*}$ and $N_2^{*}$. From the second equation, we express $N_2^{*}$ in terms of $N_1^{*}$: $N_2^{*} = K_2 - \\alpha_{21} N_1^{*}$. Substituting this into the first equation yields:\n$$\nN_1^{*} + \\alpha_{12} (K_2 - \\alpha_{21} N_1^{*}) = K_1\n$$\n$$\nN_1^{*} + \\alpha_{12} K_2 - \\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21} N_1^{*} = K_1\n$$\n$$\nN_1^{*} (1 - \\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}) = K_1 - \\alpha_{12} K_2\n$$\nSolving for $N_1^{*}$ gives:\n$$\nN_1^{*} = \\frac{K_1 - \\alpha_{12} K_2}{1 - \\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}}\n$$\nBy symmetry, or by substituting the expression for $N_1^{*}$ back into the equation for $N_2^{*}$, we find:\n$$\nN_2^{*} = \\frac{K_2 - \\alpha_{21} K_1}{1 - \\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}}\n$$\nFor the coexistence equilibrium to be strictly positive ($N_1^{*}  0$ and $N_2^{*}  0$), the numerators and the common denominator must have the same sign. This leads to two distinct sets of conditions:\nCase A: $1 - \\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}  0$. This implies we must have $K_1 - \\alpha_{12} K_2  0$ and $K_2 - \\alpha_{21} K_1  0$. This case corresponds to stable coexistence, where intraspecific competition is stronger than interspecific competition for both species ($K_1/\\alpha_{12}  K_2$ and $K_2/\\alpha_{21}  K_1$).\nCase B: $1 - \\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}  0$. This implies we must have $K_1 - \\alpha_{12} K_2  0$ and $K_2 - \\alpha_{21} K_1  0$. This case corresponds to an unstable coexistence equilibrium (a saddle point), where interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition ($K_1/\\alpha_{12}  K_2$ and $K_2/\\alpha_{21}  K_1$).\n\n**2) Verification and Calculation for Given Parameters**\n\nThe parameter values are given as: $r_1 = 0.8$, $r_2 = 1.1$, $K_1 = 600$, $K_2 = 400$, $\\alpha_{12} = 0.4$, and $\\alpha_{21} = 0.5$.\nWe first check the condition for existence. We evaluate the denominator:\n$$\n1 - \\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21} = 1 - (0.4)(0.5) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8\n$$\nSince the denominator is positive, we are in Case A.

Here $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ denotes the vector of unknown parameters for a given functional response model.\n\nDerive, from first principles, the likelihood functions for three alternative functional responses based on the following foundational assumptions and definitions:\n\n- Fundamental base for encounter and capture: encounters between a predator and any specific prey individual follow a Poisson process with a constant per-prey hazard over the duration of a trial; the survival probability for a prey individual under a constant hazard $h_i$ over time $T_i$ is $\\exp(- h_i T_i)$, so the capture probability is $p_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = 1 - \\exp(- h_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}; N_i) T_i)$.\n- The three alternative functional responses are defined by how the per-prey hazard $h_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}; N_i)$ depends on prey availability $N_i$, time $T_i$, and parameters:\n    - Model $\\mathcal{M}_1$ (Type I): a constant per-prey hazard parameterized by a single rate parameter $a$.\n    - Model $\\mathcal{M}_2$ (Type II): a saturating total capture rate leads to a per-prey hazard that decreases with $N_i$ and is parameterized by a search rate $a$ and a handling time $h$.\n    - Model $\\mathcal{M}_3$ (Type III): a sigmoid (accelerating then saturating) total capture rate leads to a per-prey hazard with an accelerating component at low $N_i$, parameterized by a search rate $a$ and a handling time $h$.\n\nYour tasks are:\n\n1) For each model $\\mathcal{M}_m$, $m \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$, derive the trial-specific capture probability $p_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m)$ from the fundamental base, then derive the corresponding log-likelihood $\\ell_m(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m \\mid \\{(N_i,T_i,y_i)\\}_{i=1}^n)$ under the $\\mathrm{Binomial}(N_i, p_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m))$ observation model. The derivation must start from the Poisson-process hazard assumption and the independence of prey conditional on the hazard. Do not use any shortcut formulas for the functional responses; instead, express $h_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m; N_i)$ for each model by reasoning from the verbal definitions above, then obtain $p_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m)$ and the binomial log-likelihood.\n\n2) For each model, obtain the maximum likelihood estimate $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m$ by maximizing the log-likelihood. Then compute the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the small-sample correction Akaike Information Criterion (AICc).

Equivalently, all its eigenvalues are strictly positive and the ratio of the largest to the smallest eigenvalue is finite and below a reasonable threshold.\n    - Sensitivity (Jacobian) rank condition: construct the sensitivity matrix whose $i$-th row is the gradient of $p_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m)$ with respect to $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m$ evaluated at $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m$. Require that this matrix has full column rank equal to $k_m$.\nA model passes identifiability if and only if both conditions hold and all components of $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m$ lie strictly in the interior of the feasible parameter space.\n\n4) Model selection rule: among models that pass identifiability, select the model with the smallest $\\mathrm{AICc}$. In the event of a tie within a tolerance of $\\varepsilon = 10^{-6}$, select the model with the smaller $k_m$; if still tied, select the model with the smaller index $m$. If no model passes identifiability, declare no selection.\n\nTest suite.

I will proceed with the validation and then the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Experimental Setup**: A set of $n$ independent trials. In trial $i$, an initial number of prey $N_i$ is exposed to one predator for duration $T_i$ (hours). The number of prey consumed is $y_i$. Prey density is constant during each trial (continuous-replacement).\n- **Observation Model**: For each trial $i$, the number of consumed prey $y_i$ follows a Binomial distribution, conditional on the capture probability $p_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$: $y_i \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(N_i, p_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}))$.\n- **Capture Probability Model**: The capture probability is derived from a Poisson process for encounters. The per-prey hazard rate is $h_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}; N_i)$. The survival probability for a single prey over time $T_i$ is $\\exp(-h_i T_i)$. The capture probability is $p_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = 1 - \\exp(-h_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}; N_i) T_i)$.\n- **Model $\\mathcal{M}_1$ (Type I)**: Constant per-prey hazard, parameterized by a rate parameter $a$. $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_1 = (a)$.\n- **Model $\\mathcal{M}_2$ (Type II)**: Saturating total capture rate, leading to a per-prey hazard that decreases with $N_i$.

Parameterized by search rate $a$ and handling time $h$. $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_3 = (a, h)$.\n- **Parameter Constraints**: $a  0$ for $\\mathcal{M}_1$. $a  0$ and $h  0$ for $\\mathcal{M}_2, \\mathcal{M}_3$.\n- **Tasks**:\n    1. Derive the log-likelihood $\\ell_m(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m \\mid \\text{data})$ for each model $m \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ from first principles.\n    2. Obtain Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLEs) $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m$ and compute AIC and AICc using the formulas:\n       $$ \\mathrm{AIC}_m = 2 k_m - 2 \\ell_m(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m) $$\n       $$ \\mathrm{AICc}_m = \\mathrm{AIC}_m + \\frac{2 k_m (k_m + 1)}{n - k_m - 1} $$\n       where $k_m$ is the number of parameters and $n$ is the number of trials, assuming $n  k_m + 1$.\n    3.

Model selection rule: Among identifiable models, select the one with the minimum AICc. Ties (within $\\varepsilon = 10^{-6}$) are broken by choosing smaller $k_m$, then smaller model index $m$. If no model is identifiable, no model is selected.\n- **Datasets**:\n    - Dataset A: $N = [5,20,40,5,20,40,10]$, $T = [1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.5]$, $y = [1,3,4,2,5,8,2]$.\n    - Dataset B: $N = [8,16,32,8,16,32,32]$, $T = [1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.5]$, $y = [1,2,4,2,4,8,2]$.\n    - Dataset C: $N = [20,20,20,20]$, $T = [0.5,1.0,2.0,3.0]$, $y = [1,3,5,7]$.\n- **Output Format**: A single line `[[m_A,b_A],[m_B,b_B],[m_C,b_C]]` where $m$ is the model index ($0$ for none) and $b$ is the identifiability flag ($1$ for pass, $0$ for fail).\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, drawing upon canonical models (Type I, II, III functional responses) and standard statistical methods (Binomial likelihood, MLE, AICc, identifiability analysis) used in quantitative ecology. The derivation from a Poisson process for encounters is a rigorous and well-established approach for modeling such experiments. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data, formulas, and clear, objective criteria for model fitting and selection. The datasets are complete and do not contain obvious contradictions or infeasible values. The tasks are all formalizable and lead to a unique solution based on the prescribed methodology. There are no signs of Unsoundness, Non-Formalizability, Incompleteness, Unrealistic Conditions, or other flaws listed in the validation criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution involves three main parts: (1) derivation of the log-likelihood functions for the three models from first principles, (2) specification of the numerical procedures for model fitting and identifiability assessment, and (3) implementation of these procedures to analyze the provided datasets.\n\n#### 1. Derivation of the Log-Likelihood Functions\n\nThe foundation for all models is the Binomial observation model for the number of prey consumed, $y_i$, in trial $i$:\n$$ y_i \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(N_i, p_i) $$\nwhere $N_i$ is the number of prey available and $p_i$ is the probability that any single prey individual is captured during the trial of duration $T_i$. The probability mass function for a single trial is:\n$$ P(y_i \\mid N_i, p_i) = \\binom{N_i}{y_i} p_i^{y_i} (1 - p_i)^{N_i - y_i} $$\nThe capture probability $p_i$ is given by $p_i = 1 - \\exp(-h_i T_i)$, where $h_i$ is the constant per-prey hazard rate during trial $i$. Substituting this into the likelihood gives:\n$$ 1 - p_i = \\exp(-h_i T_i) $$\nThe log-likelihood for a single trial is therefore:\n$$ \\log L_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\log\\binom{N_i}{y_i} + y_i \\log\\left(1 - \\exp(-h_i T_i)\\right) + (N_i - y_i) \\log\\left(\\exp(-h_i T_i)\\right) $$\n$$ \\log L_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\log\\binom{N_i}{y_i} + y_i \\log\\left(1 - \\exp(-h_i T_i)\\right) - (N_i - y_i) h_i T_i $$\nSince trials are independent, the total log-likelihood for a dataset of $n$ trials is the sum over all trials:\n$$ \\ell(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\text{data}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ \\log\\binom{N_i}{y_i} + y_i \\log\\left(1 - \\exp(-h_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}; N_i) T_i)\\right) - (N_i - y_i) h_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}; N_i) T_i \\right] $$\nThe models differ in their definition of the per-prey hazard $h_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}; N_i)$.\n\n**Model $\\mathcal{M}_1$ (Type I)**\nThis model assumes a constant per-prey hazard rate, independent of prey density $N_i$. The only parameter is the attack rate $a$.\n- **Hazard Rate**: $h_{i,1}(a; N_i) = a$\n- **Parameters**: $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_1 = (a)$, with $a  0$. Number of parameters $k_1 = 1$.\n- **Capture Probability**: $p_{i,1}(a) = 1 - \\exp(-a T_i)$\n- **Log-Likelihood**:\n$$ \\ell_1(a \\mid \\text{data}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ \\log\\binom{N_i}{y_i} + y_i \\log\\left(1 - \\exp(-a T_i)\\right) - (N_i - y_i) a T_i \\right] $$\n\n**Model $\\mathcal{M}_2$ (Type II)**\nThis model assumes a saturating total capture rate due to predator handling time. The per-prey hazard decreases with prey density. The derivation from first principles considers the predator's time budget. Let the total time be $T_{total}$. It is divided into searching time ($T_s$) and handling time ($T_{handle}$). The number of prey encountered and captured is $C = a' N_i T_s$, where $a'$ is an instantaneous search rate and $N_i$ is prey density. The total handling time for these captures is $T_{handle} = h C = h a' N_i T_s$.\nThe time budget is $T_{total} = T_s + T_{handle} = T_s(1 + h a' N_i)$.\nThe proportion of time the predator spends searching is $\\frac{T_s}{T_{total}} = \\frac{1}{1 + h a' N_i}$.\nThe per-prey encounter rate, which is the hazard $h_i$, is the product of the predator's search rate and the proportion of time it is searching. Let $a$ be the search rate parameter.\n- **Hazard Rate**: $h_{i,2}(a, h; N_i) = a \\times \\frac{1}{1 + a h N_i} = \\frac{a}{1 + a h N_i}$\n- **Parameters**: $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_2 = (a, h)$, with $a  0, h  0$. Number of parameters $k_2 = 2$.\n- **Capture Probability**: $p_{i,2}(a, h) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a T_i}{1 + a h N_i}\\right)$\n- **Log-Likelihood**:\n$$ \\ell_2(a,h \\mid \\text{data}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ \\log\\binom{N_i}{y_i} + y_i \\log\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a T_i}{1+ahN_i}\\right)\\right) - (N_i - y_i) \\frac{a T_i}{1+ahN_i} \\right] $$\n\n**Model $\\mathcal{M}_3$ (Type III)**\nThis model features a sigmoid total capture rate, where the attack rate itself increases with prey density, for example due to predator learning or prey switching. A common way to model this while retaining the two parameters $(a, h)$ is to make the effective search rate density-dependent, e.g., proportional to $N_i$. Following the logic for Type II, we replace the constant search rate $a$ in the numerator of the total capture rate with a term that depends on $N_i$, typically $a N_i$. The total number of prey consumed per unit time is $N_i \\times h_i$. A standard form for a sigmoid capture rate is $\\frac{a' N_i^2}{b+N_i^2}$. The formulation consistent with our hazard derivation is to modify the Type II logic. Let the instantaneous attack coefficient be $a N_i$. The time budget argument then gives a hazardrate $h_i = \\frac{a N_i}{1 + h (a N_i) N_i}$.\n- **Hazard Rate**: $h_{i,3}(a, h; N_i) = \\frac{a N_i}{1 + a h N_i^2}$\n- **Parameters**: $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_3 = (a, h)$, with $a  0, h  0$. Number of parameters $k_3 = 2$.\n- **Capture Probability**: $p_{i,3}(a, h) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a N_i T_i}{1 + a h N_i^2}\\right)$\n- **Log-Likelihood**:\n$$ \\ell_3(a,h \\mid \\text{data}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ \\log\\binom{N_i}{y_i} + y_i \\log\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a N_i T_i}{1+ahN_i^2}\\right)\\right) - (N_i - y_i) \\frac{a N_i T_i}{1+ahN_i^2} \\right] $$\n\n#### 2. Model Fitting and Selection Procedure\n\nFor each model $\\mathcal{M}_m$, the parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m$ are estimated by maximizing the log-likelihood $\\ell_m(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m)$, which is equivalent to minimizing the negative log-likelihood $-\\ell_m(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m)$. The constraints $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m  0$ are handled by optimizing over the log-transformed parameters. Let $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_m = \\log(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m)$. A numerical optimization routine (e.g., BFGS) is used to find the MLE $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}_m$, from which we obtain $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m = \\exp(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}_m)$.\n\nAfter fitting, each model is assessed for local identifiability at the MLE $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m$. A model is deemed identifiable if it passes two numerical checks:\n1.  **Observed Fisher Information Condition**: The observed Fisher information matrix, $\\mathcal{I}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m)$, is computed as the negative Hessian of the log-likelihood evaluated at the MLE: $\\mathcal{I}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m) = -\\nabla^2 \\ell_m(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m)$. The matrix must be positive definite (all eigenvalues are strictly positive) and have a finite condition number (ratio of largest to smallest eigenvalue) below a set threshold (e.g., $10^8$). This Hessian is computed numerically using a finite difference approximation of the analytical gradient of the log-likelihood.\n2.  **Sensitivity (Jacobian) Rank Condition**: The sensitivity matrix $J$ is constructed, where its $(i, j)$-th element is the partial derivative of the $i$-th capture probability $p_i$ with respect to the $j$-th parameter, evaluated at $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m$: $J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial p_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m)}{\\partial \\theta_{m,j}}\\Big|_{\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m}$. This $n \\times k_m$ matrix must have full column rank, i.e., $\\mathrm{rank}(J) = k_m$.\n\nThe model selection is performed on the subset of models that pass the identifiability checks. The Akaike Information Criterion with small-sample correction (AICc) is calculated for each identifiable model:\n$$ \\mathrm{AICc}_m = 2 k_m - 2 \\ell_m(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m) + \\frac{2 k_m (k_m + 1)}{n - k_m - 1} $$\nThe model with the lowest AICc value is chosen. The specified tie-breaking rules are applied if necessary. If no model passes the identifiability checks, no model is selected.", "answer": "[[3,1],[2,1],[1,1]]", "id": "2810598"}]}
