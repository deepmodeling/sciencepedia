It represents a fundamental case of balancing selection in population genetics. All necessary information is provided, and the premises are consistent. Therefore, we may proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe problem describes a diploid population with two alleles, $A$ and $a$, at a single locus. Before viability selection, the population is assumed to be in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. The frequencies of the three genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ are given by $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2$ respectively, where $p$ is the frequency of allele $A$ and $q = 1-p$ is the frequency of allele $a$.\n\nThe relative viabilities (fitnesses) are given as $W_{AA} = 1 - s$, $W_{Aa} = 1$, and $W_{aa} = 1 - t$, with $s > 0$ and $t > 0$. These fitness values are multiplied by the genotype frequencies before selection to determine the proportional contribution of each genotype to the next generation.\n\nThe frequency of each genotype after selection is proportional to:\n- For $AA$: $p^2 W_{AA} = p^2 (1 - s)$\n- For $Aa$: $2pq W_{Aa} = 2pq$\n- For $aa$: $q^2 W_{aa} = q^2 (1 - t)$\n\nThe sum of these proportional frequencies gives the mean fitness of the population, denoted by $\\bar{W}$. This serves as the normalization factor to ensure the frequencies in the next generation sum to $1$.\n$$ \\bar{W} = p^2 W_{AA} + 2pq W_{Aa} + q^2 W_{aa} $$\n$$ \\bar{W} = p^2(1-s) + 2pq + q^2(1-t) $$\n\nThe frequency of allele $A$ in the next generation, denoted $p'$, is the frequency of the $AA$ genotype plus half the frequency of the $Aa$ genotype after selection and normalization.\n$$ p' = \\frac{p^2 W_{AA} + \\frac{1}{2}(2pq W_{Aa})}{\\bar{W}} = \\frac{p^2 W_{AA} + pq W_{Aa}}{\\bar{W}} $$\nSubstituting the given fitnesses:\n$$ p' = \\frac{p^2(1-s) + pq(1)}{\\bar{W}} = \\frac{p(p(1-s) + q)}{\\bar{W}} $$\n\nAn equilibrium exists when the allele frequency does not change from one generation to the next, which means $\\Delta p = p' - p = 0$.

The term $P_{12}\\beta_2 = 1 \\times (1/18) = 1/18 \\approx 0.0556$ is the indirect contribution to the selection on $z_1$ due to selection acting on the correlated trait $z_2$. The term $P_{11}\\beta_1 = 2 \\times (1/450) = 1/225 \\approx 0.0044$ arises from direct selection on $z_1$.\nIn this specific case, the vast majority of the total selection measured on trait $z_1$ (the differential $s_1$) is actually an indirect consequence of strong selection on the positively correlated trait $z_2$. The direct selection on $z_1$ (measured by the gradient $\\beta_1$) is very weak.
