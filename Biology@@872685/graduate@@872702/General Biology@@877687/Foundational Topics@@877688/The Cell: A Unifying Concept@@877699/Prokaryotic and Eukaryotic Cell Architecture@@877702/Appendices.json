It is a standard exercise in applying fundamental principles of protein structure and thermodynamics. No flaws are identified.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe problem requires finding the minimal integer number of residues, which we denote as $n$, that satisfies two independent conditions simultaneously.\n\n**Condition 1: Geometric Constraint**\nThe length of the alpha-helical segment, $L_{\\text{helix}}$, must be sufficient to span the hydrophobic core of the membrane, which has a thickness $L$. The length of the helix is the product of the number of residues, $n$, and the axial rise per residue, $h$.\n$$L_{\\text{helix}} = n \\cdot h$$\nFor the helix to span the core, its length must be greater than or equal to the core thickness:\n$$n \\cdot h \\ge L$$\nSolving for $n$, we obtain the first constraint on the number of residues:\n$$n \\ge \\frac{L}{h}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$n \\ge \\frac{3.5 \\text{ nm}}{0.15 \\text{ nm}}$$\n$$n \\ge \\frac{3.5}{0.15} = \\frac{350}{15} = \\frac{70}{3} \\approx 23.33$$\nSince the number of residues $n$ must be an integer, the smallest integer value of $n$ that satisfies the geometric constraint is the ceiling of this value:\n$$n_{\\text{geom}} \\ge \\lceil 23.33 \\rceil = 24$$\nThus, a minimum of $24$ residues are required to physically span the membrane core.\n\n**Condition 2: Thermodynamic Constraint**\nThe total standard Gibbs free energy of transfer, $\\Delta G_{\\text{total}}$, must be non-positive for spontaneous insertion. This energy is the sum of the favorable contributions from the $n$ hydrophobic residues and the unfavorable contributions from the two flanking lysine residues.\n$$\\Delta G_{\\text{total}} = n \\cdot \\Delta g_{h} + 2 \\cdot \\Delta g_{c}$$\nThe condition for spontaneous insertion is $\\Delta G_{\\text{total}} \\le 0$.\n$$n \\cdot \\Delta g_{h} + 2 \\cdot \\Delta g_{c} \\le 0$$\nWe must solve this inequality for $n$.\n$$n \\cdot \\Delta g_{h} \\le -2 \\cdot \\Delta g_{c}$$\nThe value of $\\Delta g_{h}$ is negative ($-0.6$ kcal mol$^{-1}$). Therefore, dividing both sides by $\\Delta g_{h}$ requires reversing the inequality sign:\n$$n \\ge \\frac{-2 \\cdot \\Delta g_{c}}{\\Delta g_{h}}$$\nSubstituting the given energy values:\n$$n \\ge \\frac{-2 \\cdot (2.0 \\text{ kcal mol}^{-1})}{-0.6 \\text{ kcal mol}^{-1}}$$\n$$n \\ge \\frac{-4.0}{-0.6} = \\frac{40}{6} = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.67$$\nSince $n$ must be an integer, the smallest integer value of $n$ that satisfies the thermodynamic constraint is:\n$$n_{\\text{thermo}} \\ge \\lceil 6.67 \\rceil = 7$$\nThus, a minimum of $7$ residues are required for the insertion process to be energetically favorable.\n\n**Conclusion**\nTo find the minimal number of residues $n_{\\min}$ that satisfies both the geometric and thermodynamic requirements, we must find the smallest integer $n$ that satisfies both $n \\ge 24$ and $n \\ge 7$. The number of residues must be greater than or equal to the maximum of these two lower bounds.\n$$n_{\\min} = \\max(24, 7)$$\n$$n_{\\min} = 24$$\nTherefore, the minimal integer number of residues required for the hydrophobic alpha helix to both span the core and insert spontaneously is $24$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{24}$$", "id": "2959755"}, {"introduction": "Cellular life relies on organizing complex biochemical pathways, often by confining them within specialized compartments to increase efficiency and sequester toxic intermediates.

We shall proceed with a rigorous analytical and computational solution.\n\nThe solution process involves a sequential calculation for each test case, which specifies the pore radius $r$ and species-specific hindrance factors $\\alpha_S$ and $\\alpha_I$.\n\n**Step 1: Calculation of System Constants**\n\nFirst, we calculate the constants that are shared across all test cases.

From mass balance, this is equal to the rate of diffusive influx:\n$$\nv_1 = k_S(S_c - S_{in}).\n$$\nThe steady-state concentration of the internal intermediate, $I$, is governed by the balance of its production by $E_1$, its consumption by $E_2$, and its leakage from the compartment:\n$$\nv_1 = \\frac{V_{2,\\max}I}{K_{M2}+I} + \\lambda_I I,\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda_I = \\frac{k_I k_d}{k_I + k_d}$ is the effective first-order rate constant for intermediate loss from the compartment, accounting for both diffusion and cytosolic detoxification.\n\nWhile the problem suggests a numerical root-finding approach for $I$, algebraic rearrangement reveals that this equation is also a quadratic in $I$. An analytical solution is therefore not only possible but superior, as it is exact, computationally more efficient, and not subject to the convergence issues or tolerance settings of numerical methods.

Assuming the activity $ a $ can be approximated by the molar concentration $ [\\mathrm{H}^{+}] $, the expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta \\mu = RT (\\ln [\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\ln [\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out}}) + F (\\psi_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\psi_{\\mathrm{out}}) $$\nUsing the property of logarithms $ \\ln x - \\ln y = \\ln(x/y) $ and the given definition of the transmembrane potential difference $ \\Delta \\psi = \\psi_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\psi_{\\mathrm{out}} $:\n$$ \\Delta \\mu = RT \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{in}}}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out}}} \\right) + F \\Delta \\psi $$\nNow, we relate the concentration ratio to the pH difference. The definition of pH is $ \\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^{+}]) $, which implies $ [\\mathrm{H}^{+}] = 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}} $. To incorporate this, we convert the natural logarithm ($ \\ln $) to the base-10 logarithm ($ \\log_{10} $) using the identity $ \\ln x = \\ln(10) \\log_{10} x $:\n$$ \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{in}}}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out}}} \\right) = \\ln(10) \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{10^{-\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{in}}}}{10^{-\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{out}}}} \\right) = \\ln(10) \\log_{10} (10^{\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{out}} - \\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{in}}}) $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ \\ln(10) (\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{out}} - \\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{in}}) = -\\ln(10) (\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{out}}) = -\\ln(10) \\Delta \\mathrm{pH} $$\nwhere we have used the given definition $ \\Delta \\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{out}} $. Substituting this back into the equation for $ \\Delta \\mu $:\n$$ \\Delta \\mu = -RT \\ln(10) \\Delta \\mathrm{pH} + F \\Delta \\psi $$\nThis quantity, $ \\Delta \\mu $, represents the Gibbs free energy change per mole of protons translocated and has units of $ \\mathrm{J \\ mol^{-1}} $. The proton motive force, $ \\Delta p $, is conventionally defined as this free energy change normalized by the Faraday constant, $ F $, which gives it units of volts ($ \\mathrm{V} $).\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{\\Delta \\mu}{F} $$\nTherefore, the expression for the proton motive force is:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{-RT \\ln(10) \\Delta \\mathrm{pH} + F \\Delta \\psi}{F} = \\Delta \\psi - \\frac{RT \\ln(10)}{F} \\Delta \\mathrm{pH} $$\nThis is the required expression. A negative value for $ \\Delta p $ indicates a spontaneous inward flow of protons.\n\nNext, we evaluate the numerical value of $ \\Delta p $ under the given conditions. The values are $ T = 310 \\ \\mathrm{K} $, $ \\Delta \\psi = -0.150 \\ \\mathrm{V} $, $ \\Delta \\mathrm{pH} = 0.75 $, $ R = 8.314 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ mol^{-1} \\ K^{-1}} $, and $ F = 96485 \\ \\mathrm{C \\ mol^{-1}} $. First, we calculate the pre-factor term:\n$$ \\frac{RT \\ln(10)}{F} = \\frac{(8.314 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ mol^{-1} \\ K^{-1}}) (310 \\ \\mathrm{K}) \\ln(10)}{96485 \\ \\mathrm{C \\ mol^{-1}}} \\approx 0.06151 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ C^{-1}} = 0.06151 \\ \\mathrm{V} $$\nNow, we substitute the values into the derived expression for $ \\Delta p $:\n$$ \\Delta p \\approx -0.150 \\ \\mathrm{V} - (0.06151 \\ \\mathrm{V})(0.75) $$\n$$ \\Delta p \\approx -0.150 \\ \\mathrm{V} - 0.04613 \\ \\mathrm{V} = -0.19613 \\ \\mathrm{V} $$\nThe proton motive force is approximately $ -0.196 \\ \\mathrm{V} $.\n\nFinally, we compute the steady ATP synthesis rate, $ J_{\\mathrm{ATP}} $. The problem states that this is given by the relation $ J_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = J_{H^{+}}/n $, assuming perfect coupling. The given values are a proton flux of $ J_{H^{+}} = 1.50 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $ and a stoichiometry of $ n = \\frac{10}{3} $ protons per ATP.\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = \\frac{J_{H^{+}}}{n} = \\frac{1.50 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{\\frac{10}{3}} $$\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = (1.50 \\times 10^{3}) \\times \\frac{3}{10} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.150 \\times 10^{3} \\times 3 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 450 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe input value $ 1.50 \\times 10^{3} $ has three significant figures. The stoichiometry is an exact number. Therefore, the result must be given to three significant figures.\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = 4.50 \\times 10^{2} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThis is the final answer for the rate of ATP synthesis for a single enzyme under the stated conditions.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{4.50 \\times 10^{2}} $$", "id": "2828137"}]}
