Construct a diploid by mating two haploid strains that differ in dominant, neutral, phenotypically scorable markers that are each tightly linked (effectively recombination fraction $r = 0$) to the centromere of the same chromosome, denoted chromosome $C$:\n- Haploid strain $X$: carries marker $A$ linked to the centromere of chromosome $C$ and is otherwise wild type (no $B$).\n- Haploid strain $Y$: carries marker $B$ linked to the centromere of chromosome $C$ and is otherwise wild type (no $A$).\n\nThe resulting diploid is heterozygous and centromere-coupled in repulsion on chromosome $C$ ($A/-$ on one homolog and $-/B$ on the other). Upon sporulation, only nondisjunction affecting chromosome $C$ is considered. Nullisomic spores for chromosome $C$ are inviable with probability $1$. Disomic spores for chromosome $C$ survive with probability $p_d$, where $0 < p_d \\leq 1$. Euploid haploid spores survive with probability $1$. Markers are neutral with respect to survival.\n\nPhenotypes are assayed by growth on selective media and scored as three mutually exclusive classes: $A$-only, $B$-only, and $A{+}B$ (both markers present).\n\nUsing only the core definitions of meiosis (homologous chromosomes segregate at meiosis I; sister chromatids segregate at meiosis II) and the consequences of nondisjunction at each division (composition of gametes with respect to homolog content), derive from first principles the expected proportions of these three phenotype classes among viable spore products for:\n- meiosis I nondisjunction of chromosome $C$, and\n- meiosis II nondisjunction of chromosome $C$.\n\nAssume that when meiosis II nondisjunction occurs, the identity of the homolog whose sister chromatids fail to separate is equally likely to be the $A$-bearing homolog or the $B$-bearing homolog (probability $1/2$ each).

It represents a classic problem in transmission genetics for distinguishing meiotic errors using linked markers. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided, and there are no contradictions. The problem is valid for analysis. We proceed from first principles.\n\nThe initial diploid cell is heterozygous for markers $A$ and $B$ on chromosome $C$. Let the homolog carrying marker $A$ be denoted $C_A$ and the homolog carrying marker $B$ be denoted $C_B$. Since the markers are tightly linked to the centromere, the recombination fraction is $r=0$. Before meiosis begins, DNA replication occurs. The cell then contains one replicated chromosome $C_A$, which consists of two sister chromatids that are both $A$, and one replicated chromosome $C_B$, which consists of two sister chromatids that are both $B$.\n\nWe analyze the two cases of nondisjunction separately.\n\nCase 1: Meiosis I Nondisjunction of Chromosome $C$\nBy definition, nondisjunction in meiosis I is the failure of homologous chromosomes to segregate. In this case, both the replicated $C_A$ and the replicated $C_B$ move to the same pole during anaphase I. The other pole receives no chromosome $C$.\n\nThis results in two secondary meiocytes:\n1.  One disomic secondary meiocyte, containing both replicated $C_A$ and $C_B$. Its chromosome $C$ genetic content is effectively $A/B$.\n2.  One nullisomic secondary meiocyte, containing no chromosome $C$.\n\nMeiosis II then proceeds.\n- The disomic secondary meiocyte undergoes a normal segregation of sister chromatids. The two sister chromatids of $C_A$ separate, and the two sister chromatids of $C_B$ separate. This division produces two spores, each receiving one chromatid from $C_A$ and one from $C_B$. These two spores are therefore disomic with genotype $A/B$.\n- The nullisomic secondary meiocyte also divides, producing two spores that are nullisomic for chromosome $C$.\n\nIn summary, a single meiosis I nondisjunction event produces a tetrad of four spores with the following genotypes for chromosome $C$: two spores of genotype $A/B$ and two nullisomic spores.\n\nWe now apply the viability rules to determine the phenotypes of the surviving spores.\n- Spores with genotype $A/B$ are disomic. They express both dominant markers, resulting in the $A{+}B$ phenotype. Their survival probability is $p_d$.\n- Nullisomic spores are inviable, with a survival probability of $0$.\n\nFrom one meiotic event, the expected number of viable spores of each phenotype class is:\n- Expected viable $A$-only spores: $0$.\n- Expected viable $B$-only spores: $0$.\n- Expected viable $A{+}B$ spores: $2 p_d$.\n\nThe total expected number of viable spores is $0 + 0 + 2 p_d = 2 p_d$. The proportions of each phenotype among the viable progeny are calculated by dividing the expected number for each class by the total expected number of viable spores. This is valid for $p_d > 0$.\n- Proportion $A$-only: $\\frac{0}{2 p_d} = 0$\n- Proportion $B$-only: $\\frac{0}{2 p_d} = 0$\n- Proportion $A{+}B$: $\\frac{2 p_d}{2 p_d} = 1$\n\nThus, for meiosis I nondisjunction, all viable spores will exhibit the $A{+}B$ phenotype.\n\nCase 2: Meiosis II Nondisjunction of Chromosome $C$\nMeiosis I proceeds normally. The homologous chromosomes $C_A$ and $C_B$ segregate to opposite poles. This produces two euploid secondary meiocytes: one containing the replicated chromosome $C_A$ and the other containing the replicated chromosome $C_B$.\n\nNondisjunction occurs during meiosis II. This is the failure of sister chromatids to separate in one of the secondary meiocytes. The problem states that this failure is equally likely to occur in the $C_A$-bearing cell or the $C_B$-bearing cell, each with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSubcase 2a: Nondisjunction in the $C_A$-bearing meiocyte (Probability $\\frac{1}{2}$).\n- The two sister chromatids of $C_A$ fail to separate, resulting in one disomic spore of genotype $A/A$ (phenotype $A$-only) and one nullisomic spore.\n- The $C_B$-bearing meiocyte divides normally, producing two euploid spores of genotype $B$ (phenotype $B$-only).\n- The four spores produced are: one $A/A$, one nullisomic, two $B$.\n\nSubcase 2b: Nondisjunction in the $C_B$-bearing meiocyte (Probability $\\frac{1}{2}$).\n- This is symmetric to the previous case. The two sister chromatids of $C_B$ fail to separate, yielding one disomic spore of genotype $B/B$ (phenotype $B$-only) and one nullisomic spore.\n- The $C_A$-bearing meiocyte divides normally, producing two euploid spores of genotype $A$ (phenotype $A$-only).\n- The four spores produced are: one $B/B$, one nullisomic, two $A$.\n\nTo find the overall proportions, we calculate the expected number of viable spores of each type per meiotic event, averaging over these two subcases. Viability rules are: euploid ($A$ or $B$) survival is $1$; disomic ($A/A$ or $B/B$) survival is $p_d$; nullisomic survival is $0$.\n\nExpected number of viable $A$-only spores:\n- From Subcase 2a (prob $\\frac{1}{2}$): one disomic $A/A$ spore with viability $p_d$. Contribution: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times p_d = \\frac{p_d}{2}$.\n- From Subcase 2b (prob $\\frac{1}{2}$): two euploid $A$ spores with viability $1$. Contribution: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 1 = 1$.\n- Total expected viable $A$-only spores: $1 + \\frac{p_d}{2}$.\n\nExpected number of viable $B$-only spores:\n- From Subcase 2a (prob $\\frac{1}{2}$): two euploid $B$ spores with viability $1$. Contribution: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 1 = 1$.\n- From Subcase 2b (prob $\\frac{1}{2}$): one disomic $B/B$ spore with viability $p_d$. Contribution: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times p_d = \\frac{p_d}{2}$.\n- Total expected viable $B$-only spores: $1 + \\frac{p_d}{2}$.\n\nExpected number of viable $A{+}B$ spores: $0$.\n\nThe total expected number of viable spores per meiosis II nondisjunction event is the sum of the above:\nTotal = $(1 + \\frac{p_d}{2}) + (1 + \\frac{p_d}{2}) + 0 = 2 + p_d$.\n\nThe proportions of each phenotype among the viable progeny are:\n- Proportion $A$-only: $\\frac{1 + \\frac{p_d}{2}}{2 + p_d} = \\frac{\\frac{2+p_d}{2}}{2+p_d} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Proportion $B$-only: $\\frac{1 + \\frac{p_d}{2}}{2 + p_d} = \\frac{\\frac{2+p_d}{2}}{2+p_d} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Proportion $A{+}B$: $\\frac{0}{2+p_d} = 0$.\n\nNotice that for meiosis II nondisjunction, the proportions of $A$-only and $B$-only phenotypes are equal and independent of the disomic survival probability $p_d$. This is due to the symmetry of the experimental design.\n\nFinal compilation of results in the specified $1 \\times 6$ matrix format:\n- MI: $A$-only: $0$\n- MI: $B$-only: $0$\n- MI: $A{+}B$: $1$\n- MII: $A$-only: $\\frac{1}{2}$\n- MII: $B$-only: $\\frac{1}{2}$\n- MII: $A{+}B$: $0$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 1 & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2814284"}, {"introduction": "Crossover events, which are essential for generating genetic diversity, do not occur independently along a chromosome; the presence of one crossover often inhibits the formation of another nearby.
