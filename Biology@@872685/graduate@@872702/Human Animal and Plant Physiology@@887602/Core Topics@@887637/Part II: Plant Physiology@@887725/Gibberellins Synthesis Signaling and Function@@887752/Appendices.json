The level of a bioactive gibberellin, denoted as $G(t)$, is not static but results from a dynamic equilibrium between its synthesis, enzymatic deactivation, and dilution due to growth. This practice guides you through the process of constructing a simple yet powerful mathematical model from first principles to predict the steady-state hormone concentration and analyze how perturbations to the system, such as changes in enzyme activity, affect this balance [@problem_id:2570661].", "problem": "A plant cell maintains a pool of the bioactive gibberellin A4 (GA4), which is synthesized from precursors and inactivated predominantly by gibberellin 2-oxidase (GA2ox). Let the cytosolic concentration of GA4 be denoted by $G(t)$. Assume the following foundational principles:\n- Mass conservation for a well-mixed compartment implies that the temporal change in $G(t)$ equals the net of all inflows and outflows.\n- Synthesis from upstream precursors occurs at a constant, zero-order rate $v_s$ (with units of concentration per time).\n- Enzymatic deactivation by GA2ox follows first-order kinetics with respect to GA4, with an effective first-order rate constant $k_d$ (with units of inverse time).\n- Dilution of GA4 concentration due to cell or organ growth behaves as an effective first-order loss process with rate constant $k_g$ (with units of inverse time).\n\nStarting from these principles alone, derive the steady-state concentration $G^{\\ast}$ of GA4. Then, suppose a transcriptional induction doubles GA2ox activity such that the effective first-order deactivation rate constant becomes $2k_d$ while $v_s$ and $k_g$ remain unchanged.

If you find it helpful for your reasoning, you may check dimensional consistency, but the final expressions must be given symbolically in terms of $v_s$, $k_d$, and $k_g$.", "solution": "The problem as stated provides a set of biologically motivated principles to construct a mathematical model for the concentration of the plant hormone gibberellin A4, denoted as $G(t)$. The problem is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, and well-posed. We shall proceed with its formal solution.\n\nThe foundational principle is the law of mass conservation applied to the concentration $G(t)$ in a well-mixed compartment. This can be expressed as a differential equation where the rate of change of the concentration, $\\frac{dG}{dt}$, is the sum of all production (inflow) and removal (outflow) rates.\n\nThe problem specifies three processes affecting $G(t)$:\n1.  **Synthesis**: Production from precursors occurs at a constant, zero-order rate $v_s$. This contributes a positive term $+v_s$ to the rate of change. The units of $v_s$ are concentration per unit time.\n2.  **Enzymatic Deactivation**: Degradation by the enzyme GA2ox follows first-order kinetics with respect to $G(t)$. This is a loss process, contributing a term $-k_d G(t)$, where $k_d$ is the first-order rate constant with units of inverse time.\n3.  **Dilution**: Loss of concentration due to cell growth is modeled as an effective first-order process. This contributes another loss term, $-k_g G(t)$, where $k_g$ is the first-order rate constant for dilution, also with units of inverse time.\n\nCombining these terms, we formulate the ordinary differential equation governing the dynamics of $G(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dG}{dt} = v_s - k_d G - k_g G\n$$\nThis equation can be rewritten by factoring out the $G(t)$ term:\n$$\n\\frac{dG}{dt} = v_s - (k_d + k_g)G\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients.\n\nThe first task is to find the steady-state concentration, which we denote as $G^{\\ast}$. By definition, a steady state is a condition where the concentration does not change over time. Mathematically, this corresponds to setting the time derivative to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dG}{dt} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this condition into our dynamic equation gives:\n$$\n0 = v_s - (k_d + k_g)G^{\\ast}\n$$\nSolving this algebraic equation for $G^{\\ast}$ is a trivial matter. We rearrange the terms:\n$$\n(k_d + k_g)G^{\\ast} = v_s\n$$\nAnd isolate $G^{\\ast}$ to obtain the first required expression:\n$$\nG^{\\ast} = \\frac{v_s}{k_d + k_g}\n$$\nThis is the steady-state concentration of GA4 under the initial conditions.\n\nThe second part of the problem describes a change in the system. A transcriptional induction event doubles the activity of the enzyme GA2ox. This means the effective first-order rate constant for deactivation is now $2k_d$. The synthesis rate $v_s$ and the dilution rate constant $k_g$ remain unchanged. We are asked to find the new steady-state concentration, $G^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{new}}$.\n\nWe apply the same logic as before, but with the modified parameter. The new differential equation for $G(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dG}{dt} = v_s - (2k_d) G - k_g G\n$$\nFactoring out $G(t)$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{dG}{dt} = v_s - (2k_d + k_g)G\n$$\nTo find the new steady state $G^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{new}}$, we again set the time derivative to zero:\n$$\n0 = v_s - (2k_d + k_g)G^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{new}}\n$$\nSolving for $G^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{new}}$ gives the second required expression:\n$$\n(2k_d + k_g)G^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{new}} = v_s\n$$\n$$\nG^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\frac{v_s}{2k_d + k_g}\n$$\n\nThe final task is to calculate the fold-change, $F$, defined as the ratio of the new steady-state concentration to the original one:\n$$\nF \\equiv \\frac{G^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{new}}}{G^{\\ast}}\n$$\nWe substitute the expressions we derived for $G^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{new}}$ and $G^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{v_s}{2k_d + k_g}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{v_s}{k_d + k_g}\\right)}\n$$\nThe synthesis rate $v_s$ is a common factor in the numerator and denominator, and thus cancels out, provided $v_s \\neq 0$. If $v_s = 0$, both steady-state concentrations would be zero and the ratio would be undefined, which is not a meaningful biological scenario. We assume $v_s > 0$.\n$$\nF = \\frac{1}{2k_d + k_g} \\times \\frac{k_d + k_g}{1}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the fold-change:\n$$\nF = \\frac{k_d + k_g}{2k_d + k_g}\n$$\nThis result shows that the fold-change in the steady-state hormone level depends only on the relative magnitudes of the initial deactivation rate and the dilution rate, not on the absolute rate of synthesis.\n\nThe three required expressions, expressed solely in terms of $v_s$, $k_d$, and $k_g$, are:\n1.  $G^{\\ast} = \\frac{v_s}{k_d + k_g}$\n2.  $G^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\frac{v_s}{2k_d + k_g}$\n3.  $F = \\frac{k_d + k_g}{2k_d + k_g}$\n\nThese will be provided in the specified format for the final answer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{v_{s}}{k_{d} + k_{g}} & \\frac{v_{s}}{2k_{d} + k_{g}} & \\frac{k_{d} + k_{g}}{2k_{d} + k_{g}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2570661"}, {"introduction": "Knowing the steady-state concentration of a hormone is only half the story; we must also understand how the cellular machinery translates this concentration into a physiological action.

In this problem, you will use the Hill function—a cornerstone model for describing cooperative processes—to analyze hypothetical data from a GA-induced enzyme activity assay, learning how to linearize the model and extract the Hill coefficient ($n$), a quantitative measure of the system's sensitivity [@problem_id:2570613].", "problem": "A classical system for studying gibberellin-regulated tissue weakening during seed germination is the endosperm cap of many dicots, where gibberellin stimulates transcription and secretion of wall-modifying enzymes.

I will address each task in turn.\n\nFirst, we must derive the quantitative relationship from the given assumptions.\nLet $E$ represent the steady-state enzyme activity and $E_{\\max}$ be the maximal achievable activity. The fractional activity, $y$, is defined as the ratio of the measured activity to the maximal activity:\n$$ y = \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} $$\nAccording to the first assumption, the fractional activity $y$ is proportional to the steady-state probability that the enzyme's promoter is in an active state. Since the basal activity is negligible, we can state this as an equality: $y = P_{\\text{active}}$.\n\nThe second assumption states that promoter activation is governed by the cooperative binding of $n$ identical and independent activator molecules, which we denote by $A$. This process can be modeled by the following overall mass-action equilibrium:\n$$ P_{\\text{inactive}} + nA \\rightleftharpoons P_{\\text{active}} $$\nwhere $P_{\\text{inactive}}$ represents the promoter in the inactive state and $P_{\\text{active}}$ represents the promoter in the active state. The macroscopic dissociation constant, $K_D$, for this equilibrium is given by:\n$$ K_D = \\frac{[P_{\\text{inactive}}][A]^n}{[P_{\\text{active}}]} $$\nThe fractional activity $y$, which equals the fraction of promoters in the active state, is:\n$$ y = \\frac{[P_{\\text{active}}]}{[P_{\\text{total}}]} = \\frac{[P_{\\text{active}}]}{[P_{\\text{inactive}}] + [P_{\\text{active}}]} $$\nTo express $y$ in terms of the activator concentration $[A]$, we first rearrange the equilibrium expression to find $[P_{\\text{inactive}}]$:\n$$ [P_{\\text{inactive}}] = K_D \\frac{[P_{\\text{active}}]}{[A]^n} $$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $y$:\n$$ y = \\frac{[P_{\\text{active}}]}{K_D \\frac{[P_{\\text{active}}]}{[A]^n} + [P_{\\text{active}}]} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_D}{[A]^n} + 1} = \\frac{[A]^n}{K_D + [A]^n} $$\nLet us define a constant $K_A$ such that $K_A^n = K_D$.

The equation becomes:\n$$ y = \\frac{[A]^n}{K_A^n + [A]^n} $$\nThe third assumption states that the activator concentration $[A]$ is a monotonically increasing, saturating function of the gibberellin concentration $[G]$. A common simplification in biological modeling is to assume that in the relevant concentration range, there is a simple relationship between the initial ligand and the final activator. For the purpose of deriving the standard Hill plot, we assume that the system operates in a regime where $[A]$ is proportional to $[G]$, i.e., $[A] = c[G]$ for some constant $c$. Substituting this into our expression for $y$:\n$$ y = \\frac{(c[G])^n}{K_A^n + (c[G])^n} = \\frac{c^n [G]^n}{K_A^n + c^n [G]^n} = \\frac{[G]^n}{(K_A/c)^n + [G]^n} $$\nWe define a new constant, $K_G = K_A/c$, which represents the concentration of gibberellin $[G]$ that produces half-maximal enzyme activity. The relationship is now the familiar Hill equation in terms of the measurable ligand concentration $[G]$:\n$$ y = \\frac{[G]^n}{K_G^n + [G]^n} $$\nTo complete the first task, we must linearize this equation to expose $n$ as a slope. We rearrange the equation to solve for the ratio of occupied to unoccupied states:\n$$ y(K_G^n + [G]^n) = [G]^n $$\n$$ y K_G^n + y [G]^n = [G]^n $$\n$$ y K_G^n = [G]^n (1-y) $$\n$$ \\frac{y}{1-y} = \\frac{[G]^n}{K_G^n} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides yields the desired linear relationship:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{y}{1-y}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{[G]^n}{K_G^n}\\right) $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{y}{1-y}\\right) = n \\ln([G]) - n \\ln(K_G) $$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $Y = mX + b$, where the transformed activity is $Y = \\ln\\left(\\frac{y}{1-y}\\right)$, the transformed concentration variable is $X = \\ln([G])$, the slope is the Hill coefficient $m=n$, and the y-intercept is $b = - n \\ln(K_G)$. This concludes the derivation for the first task.\n\nNext, we address the second task: to compute the Hill coefficient $n$ using the two specified experimental data points.\nThe slope $n$ can be calculated from two points $(X_1, Y_1)$ and $(X_2, Y_2)$ using the formula:\n$$ n = \\frac{Y_2 - Y_1}{X_2 - X_1} $$\nThe given data are:\nMaximum activity: $E_{\\max} = 100.0$ units.\nPoint $1$: $[G]_1 = 20\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ gives activity $E_1 = 20.0$ units.\nPoint $2$: $[G]_2 = 80\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ gives activity $E_2 = 80.0$ units.\n\nFirst, we calculate the fractional activities, $y_1$ and $y_2$:\n$$ y_1 = \\frac{E_1}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{20.0}{100.0} = 0.2 $$\n$$ y_2 = \\frac{E_2}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{80.0}{100.0} = 0.8 $$\nNext, we compute the coordinates for the linearized plot $(X, Y) = \\left(\\ln([G]), \\ln\\left(\\frac{y}{1-y}\\right)\\right)$.\nFor Point $1$:\n$$ X_1 = \\ln([G]_1) = \\ln(20) $$\n$$ Y_1 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{y_1}{1-y_1}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.2}{1-0.2}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.2}{0.8}\\right) = \\ln(0.25) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = -\\ln(4) $$\nFor Point $2$:\n$$ X_2 = \\ln([G]_2) = \\ln(80) $$\n$$ Y_2 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{y_2}{1-y_2}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.8}{1-0.8}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.8}{0.2}\\right) = \\ln(4) $$\nFinally, we substitute these values into the slope formula to find $n$:\n$$ n = \\frac{Y_2 - Y_1}{X_2 - X_1} = \\frac{\\ln(4) - (-\\ln(4))}{\\ln(80) - \\ln(20)} $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$ and $\\ln(a) - (-\\ln(a)) = 2\\ln(a)$:\n$$ n = \\frac{2\\ln(4)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{80}{20}\\right)} = \\frac{2\\ln(4)}{\\ln(4)} = 2 $$\nThe computed Hill coefficient is exactly $2$.

The steady-state gibberellin concentration $G$ is determined by the balance of its synthesis rate $s_G$ and its total removal rate, which is the sum of a basal rate $k_{gb}$ and a catabolic rate proportional to $k_{2ox}$.\n2.  The concentration of the GA-receptor complex, $C$, is calculated under a rapid equilibrium assumption, yielding a standard binding isotherm dependent on total receptor concentration $R_T$, GA concentration $G$, and the dissociation constant $K_d$.\n3.  The additional degradation rate of DELLA proteins, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{add}}$, is modeled as a process mediated by the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, whose activity is stimulated by the GA-receptor complex $C$. This dependence is saturating, reflecting the finite capacity of the degradation machinery, and is scaled by the parameter $S$, representing the overall capacity of the SCF complex.\n4.  The steady-state DELLA protein concentration, $D$, is determined by the balance of its constant production rate $s_D$ and its total degradation rate, which is the sum of a basal rate $k_b$ and the GA-dependent additional rate $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{add}}$.\n5.  Finally, the normalized growth output, $g$, is modeled as an inhibitory function of DELLA concentration $D$. High levels of $D$ repress growth, which is captured by an inverted sigmoidal function scaled by the constant $K_g$.\n\nSecond, we implement the calculation of the logarithmic sensitivity, or elasticity, $E_p$, for a parameter $p \\in \\{k_{2ox}, R_T, S\\}$. As specified, this is numerically approximated using a symmetric second-order finite-difference formula on a logarithmic scale:\n$$\nE_p = \\frac{\\partial \\ln g}{\\partial \\ln p} \\approx \\frac{\\ln g(p(1+\\varepsilon)) - \\ln g(p(1-\\varepsilon))}{\\ln(p(1+\\varepsilon)) - \\ln(p(1-\\varepsilon))} = \\frac{\\ln g(p(1+\\varepsilon)) - \\ln g(p(1-\\varepsilon))}{\\ln(1+\\varepsilon) - \\ln(1-\\varepsilon)}\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon$ is a small relative perturbation. This is computed for each of the three variable parameters $k_{2ox}$, $R_T$, and $S$. The parameter with the largest absolute elasticity, $|\\E_p|$, is identified as having the strongest local influence on growth. A tie-breaking rule is implemented to select the parameter with the smallest index ($1$ for $k_{2ox}$, $2$ for $R_T$, $3$ for $S$) if multiple parameters have maximal elasticities within a tolerance of $\\delta = 10^{-9}$.\n\nThird, the robustness of the growth output to fluctuations in GA biosynthesis is quantified. The robustness index, $r$, is defined as the absolute elasticity with respect to the biosynthesis rate $s_G$:\n$$\nr = \\left| E_{s_G} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{\\partial \\ln g}{\\partial \\ln s_G} \\right|\n$$\nThis is computed using the same finite-difference method. To determine which parameter modification best enhances robustness, we systematically increase each parameter $p \\in \\{k_{2ox}, R_T, S\\}$ by a fraction $f = 0.05$ and re-calculate the robustness index $r$. The parameter whose increase leads to the smallest resulting robustness index is identified. This indicates which pathway component, when upregulated, most effectively buffers growth against upstream biosynthetic noise. The same tie-breaking logic is applied.\n\nFinally, the main program logic iterates through each provided test case $(k_{2ox}, R_T, S)$. For each case, it executes the two analyses described above to find the indices $i_{\\mathrm{growth}}$ and $i_{\\mathrm{robust}}$. The results are aggregated into a list of lists and printed to standard output in the precisely specified format.
