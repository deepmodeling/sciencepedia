Consider a plant extract in which only the 9-cis isomer is a competent substrate for CCD8.

This practice introduces genetic epistasis, a powerful logical tool used to order genes in a pathway by observing how mutations interact.

A canonical genetic epistasis framework in signal transduction is as follows: in a linear pathway with components $X \\rightarrow Y \\rightarrow Z$, where a hormone-activated upstream component ultimately removes a downstream repressor, loss-of-function in the repressor can be epistatic to loss-of-function in upstream components because removing the repressor bypasses the need for upstream activation. Epistasis is defined such that, for two loss-of-function mutations $x$ and $y$, if the double mutant $x;y$ has the phenotype of $x$ alone, then $x$ is epistatic to $y$, and vice versa.\n\nConsider the strigolactone pathway components DWARF14 (D14; a canonical strigolactone receptor), MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 2 (MAX2; an F-box protein in a Skp–Cullin–F-box ubiquitin ligase), and SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2-LIKE (SMXL) proteins (transcriptional repressors; here, consider the combined loss of SMXL6, SMXL7, and SMXL8). Assume the following experimentally observed phenotypes for shoot branching under controlled conditions:\n\n- Loss-of-function of D14 or MAX2 each leads to increased shoot branching relative to wild type (consistent with reduced strigolactone signaling output).\n- The SMXL6 SMXL7 SMXL8 triple loss-of-function leads to markedly reduced branching relative to wild type (consistent with increased strigolactone signaling output due to removal of repressors).\n- The D14;SMXL6 SMXL7 SMXL8 combined mutant has a reduced-branching phenotype similar to the SMXL6 SMXL7 SMXL8 triple.\n- The MAX2;SMXL6 SMXL7 SMXL8 combined mutant has a reduced-branching phenotype similar to the SMXL6 SMXL7 SMXL8 triple.\n- The D14;MAX2 double mutant has an increased-branching phenotype similar to either single mutant.\n\nUsing only these genetic interactions and the epistasis definition above as your fundamental base, which option gives the most defensible placement of MAX2 and SMXL relative to D14 in the strigolactone signaling pathway controlling shoot branching, and correctly justifies it by an epistasis argument?\n\nA. D14 -> MAX2 -> SMXL, with SMXL a repressor; SMXL loss-of-function is epistatic to both D14 and MAX2, and the D14;MAX2 double phenocopies MAX2 because MAX2 is downstream of D14.\n\nB.

The phenotype with the greatest magnitude is always epistatic, so SMXL is upstream of D14 and MAX2 because its loss-of-function produces the largest deviation from wild type.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation and is found to be scientifically valid, well-posed, and self-consistent. The provided information regarding the strigolactone signaling pathway, its components, the observed phenotypes of loss-of-function mutants, and the definition of genetic epistasis are all consistent with established principles of molecular genetics and plant physiology. The problem is a standard exercise in logical deduction from experimental data. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core task is to deduce the hierarchical relationship between the signaling components DWARF14 (D14), MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 2 (MAX2), and SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2-LIKE (SMXL) proteins using the principles of genetic epistasis.\n\nFirst, let us establish the functional roles of the components based on their single mutant phenotypes. Strigolactone signaling ultimately results in the inhibition of shoot branching.\n-   A functional signaling pathway leads to **reduced** branching.\n-   A non-functional or blocked pathway leads to **increased** branching.\n\nThe observed phenotypes are:\n1.  Loss-of-function of D14 (`d14`) or MAX2 (`max2`) results in **increased branching**. This indicates that D14 and MAX2 are positive regulators of the signaling pathway. Loss of either component breaks the pathway, preventing the signal from being transduced, which removes the inhibition on branching.\n2.  Loss-of-function of SMXL6, SMXL7, and SMXL8 (`smxl`) results in **reduced branching**. This phenotype is characteristic of a constitutively active signaling pathway. This implies that the SMXL proteins are negative regulators (repressors) of the signaling pathway. When SMXL proteins are absent, the pathway is always \"on\", leading to constant inhibition of branching.\n\nThe overall logic of the pathway is thus: Strigolactone perception by D14 activates a signaling cascade involving MAX2, which in turn leads to the inactivation or degradation of the SMXL repressor proteins. This removal of repression allows the signal to proceed, ultimately inhibiting shoot branching.\nPathway model: Signal $\\rightarrow (\\text{D}14, \\text{MAX}2) \\dashv \\text{SMXLs} \\dashv \\text{Signaling Output} \\dashv \\text{Branching}$.\n\nNow, we apply the provided definition of epistasis: \"for two loss-of-function mutations $x$ and $y$, if the double mutant $x;y$ has the phenotype of $x$ alone, then $x$ is epistatic to $y$\". In a linear pathway, the epistatic gene is generally the one that acts downstream of the other.\n\n1.  **Analysis of SMXL versus D14 and MAX2**:\n    -   The `d14` single mutant phenotype is increased branching.\n    -   The `smxl` triple mutant phenotype is reduced branching.\n    -   The problem states the `d14;smxl` combined mutant has a phenotype similar to the `smxl` triple mutant (reduced branching). Since the double/combined mutant's phenotype matches that of the `smxl` mutant, the `smxl` mutation is epistatic to the `d14` mutation. This places the SMXL proteins downstream of D14 in the pathway.\n    -   Similarly, the `max2` single mutant phenotype is increased branching.\n    -   The problem states the `max2;smxl` combined mutant has a phenotype similar to the `smxl` triple mutant (reduced branching). Therefore, the `smxl` mutation is also epistatic to the `max2` mutation, placing the SMXL proteins downstream of MAX2.\n\n    From this, we conclude that both D14 and MAX2 function upstream of the SMXL proteins.\n\n2.  **Analysis of D14 versus MAX2**:\n    -   The `d14` single mutant phenotype is increased branching.\n    -   The `max2` single mutant phenotype is also increased branching.\n    -   The problem states that the `d14;max2` double mutant has an increased-branching phenotype \"similar to either single mutant\".\n    -   When two mutations result in phenotypically indistinguishable single mutants because they block the same linear pathway, the double mutant will also exhibit this same phenotype. In such a case, epistasis analysis cannot be used to determine their relative order. According to the given definition, because the double mutant phenotype is identical to both the `d14` phenotype and the `max2` phenotype, one could argue that `d14` is epistatic to `max2` AND `max2` is epistatic to `d14`. This circularity demonstrates that their order cannot be resolved with this specific genetic cross.\n\n**Summary of deductions**: The most defensible pathway structure based *only* on the provided data is that D14 and MAX2 act in a single linear pathway upstream of the SMXL proteins. The relative order of D14 and MAX2 cannot be determined from the `d14;max2` double mutant phenotype as described.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. D14 $\\rightarrow$ MAX2 $\\rightarrow$ SMXL, with SMXL a repressor; SMXL loss-of-function is epistatic to both D14 and MAX2, and the D14;MAX2 double phenocopies MAX2 because MAX2 is downstream of D14.**\nThis option correctly places SMXL downstream of D14 and MAX2 and identifies SMXL as a repressor. However, it asserts an order for D14 and MAX2 ($D$14 \\rightarrow$ MAX$2$). The justification provided (\"the D14;MAX2 double phenocopies MAX2\") is insufficient, as the problem states the double mutant phenocopies *either* single mutant, which have identical phenotypes. This makes it impossible to assign epistatic direction between them. Therefore, this conclusion is not defensible from the given data alone. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. D14 and MAX2 act in a single linear pathway upstream of SMXL, which functions as a repressor; SMXL loss-of-function is epistatic to both D14 and MAX2. The relative order of D14 and MAX2 cannot be resolved from these double mutants alone.**\nThis option accurately summarizes all our deductions. It correctly places D14 and MAX2 upstream of the repressor SMXL based on the epistasis data. Crucially, it correctly recognizes that the indistinguishable phenotypes of `d14` and `max2` mutants prevent the resolution of their relative order via the `d14;max2` cross. This is the most precise and honest conclusion from the provided evidence. **Correct**.\n\n**C. SMXL acts upstream of D14 and MAX2; therefore, in D14;SMXL triple mutants, the D14 phenotype should dominate, showing increased branching.**\nThis option proposes that SMXL is upstream. This is directly contradicted by the experimental data provided. The problem states that the `d14;smxl` combined mutant has a *reduced-branching* phenotype (the `smxl` phenotype), not the increased-branching `d14` phenotype. Thus, the premise `SMXL acts upstream` is false. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. D14 and MAX2 act in parallel, partially redundant pathways converging on SMXL; the D14;MAX2 double equals the singles because of saturation of branching, and SMXL is upstream of both.**\nThis option makes two false claims. First, it places SMXL upstream, which is incorrect. Second, it proposes parallel pathways. In a parallel/redundant pathway model, the double mutant (`d14;max2`) would typically show a more severe phenotype than either single mutant, as both redundant branches would be blocked. The data state the double mutant is similar to the singles, which is the classic sign of a single linear pathway, not parallel ones. The \"saturation\" argument is a speculative ad-hoc rescue that is less parsimonious than the linear pathway model. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The phenotype with the greatest magnitude is always epistatic, so SMXL is upstream of D14 and MAX2 because its loss-of-function produces the largest deviation from wild type.**\nThis option is based on a fundamentally flawed understanding of epistasis. Genetic epistasis is determined by the phenotype of the double mutant relative to the single mutants, not by comparing the \"magnitude\" of single-mutant deviations from wild type. The rule proposed is not a valid principle in genetics.

Deduction: MAX2 acts downstream of SMXL to transmit the signal from SMXL to the transcriptional machinery.", "solution": "We begin from the stated base: ligand-dependent hormone signaling frequently uses an F-box protein within a Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase to polyubiquitinate repressor proteins, targeting them for 26S proteasome degradation. Removal of the repressor activates downstream transcription. For strigolactone (SL), the receptor DWARF14 (D14) binds SL and recruits the F-box protein MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 2 (MAX2), forming $\\text{SCF}^{\\text{MAX2}}$. The well-tested framework in plant hormone signaling (e.g., auxin-IAA, jasmonate-JAZ) implies that the SCF complex recognizes a degron on the repressor. Here, $SMXL^{\\Delta}$ lacks the degron and is therefore resistant to $\\text{SCF}^{\\text{MAX2}}$-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation.\n\nThe epistasis principle used is: if $X$ is a negative regulator downstream of $Y$, then a stabilized $X$ will block signaling regardless of $Y$ activity; loss of $Y$ will also lead to accumulation of endogenous $X$, and adding more stabilized $X$ will be non-additive. Conversely, if $X$ were upstream or a positive regulator, predictions would differ.\n\nDefine qualitative outputs: when SL signaling is successfully transmitted to the nucleus, $B$ decreases and $S$ increases; when SL signaling cannot be transmitted, $B$ increases and $S$ decreases relative to the signal-on state.\n\nWe evaluate the four genotype-by-transgene backgrounds under two treatments, GR24 $-$ and GR24 $+$.\n\nCase 1: *wt* + vector.\n- GR24 $-$: Basal SL signaling depends on endogenous SL levels; with no exogenous GR24, signaling is lower than with GR24 $+$. Thus relative to GR24 $+$, we expect higher $B$ and lower $S$.\n- GR24 $+$: SL perception via D14 and $\\text{SCF}^{\\text{MAX2}}$ degrades endogenous SMXL repressors, turning signaling on. Therefore $B$ decreases and $S$ increases relative to GR24 $-$.\nThus, in *wt* vector, GR24 has an effect: $B$ lower and $S$ higher at GR24 $+$ than at GR24 $-$.\n\nCase 2: *wt* + $SMXL^{\\Delta}$ overexpression.\n- $SMXL^{\\Delta}$ cannot be ubiquitinated by $\\text{SCF}^{\\text{MAX2}}$ by construction. Therefore, even under GR24 $+$, the stabilized repressor remains and continues to repress downstream transcription. This blocks signal transmission.\n- Prediction: GR24 has little to no effect; the phenotype remains that of SL-insensitivity: $B$ high and $S$ low (relative to the *wt* vector GR24 $+$ state). Qualitatively this phenocopies a loss of SL signaling.\nTherefore, in *wt* + $SMXL^{\\Delta}$, GR24 $+$ fails to lower $B$ or raise $S$; both GR24 $-$ and GR24 $+$ show high $B$, low $S$.\n\nCase 3: *max2* + vector.\n- *max2* cannot assemble functional $\\text{SCF}^{\\text{MAX2}}$; repressors are not degraded regardless of GR24. Thus, SL signaling cannot be transmitted.\n- Prediction: GR24 has no effect. $B$ is high and $S$ is low under both GR24 $-$ and GR24 $+$.\n\nCase 4: *max2* + $SMXL^{\\Delta}$ overexpression.\n- Endogenous SMXL already accumulates in *max2* because there is no $\\text{SCF}^{\\text{MAX2}}$-mediated degradation.

Therefore SMXL acts downstream of MAX2.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nOption A: It states that in *wt* with vector, GR24 lowers $B$ and raises $S$, which matches Case 1. In *wt* with $SMXL^{\\Delta}$, GR24 has no effect and the phenotype is high $B$, low $S$, phenocopying *max2*, which matches Case 2. In *max2*, GR24 has no effect; adding $SMXL^{\\Delta}$ is non-additive, matching Cases 3 and 4. The deduction that SMXL is a repressor downstream of MAX2 targeted by $\\text{SCF}^{\\text{MAX2}}$ is consistent with the base and the logic. Verdict — Correct.\n\nOption B: It claims $SMXL^{\\Delta}$ overexpression causes hypersensitivity (stronger GR24 response) in *wt*, implying SMXL is a positive regulator; and that in *max2*, GR24 restores responses if $SMXL^{\\Delta}$ is overexpressed. This contradicts the design of $SMXL^{\\Delta}$ as a degradation-resistant repressor and the loss of $\\text{SCF}^{\\text{MAX2}}$ in *max2*. There is no mechanism for GR24 to restore signaling in *max2*. The deduction that SMXL is a positive regulator upstream of MAX2 is inconsistent. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption C: It asserts that $SMXL^{\\Delta}$ has no phenotype in *wt* because MAX2 degrades it; however, by construction $SMXL^{\\Delta}$ lacks the degron and resists degradation. It also claims GR24 suppresses $SMXL^{\\Delta}$ in *max2*, which is impossible because *max2* cannot transmit the signal to degrade any SMXL. The deduction that SMXL acts upstream and requires MAX2 to function contradicts the repressor model. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption D: It says GR24 partially works even in *wt* with $SMXL^{\\Delta}$ and that in *max2* with $SMXL^{\\Delta}$, GR24 restores strong responses, implying MAX2 acts downstream of SMXL. Both predictions contradict the loss of $\\text{SCF}^{\\text{MAX2}}$ in *max2* and the stabilized nature of $SMXL^{\\Delta}$; the deduced order MAX2 downstream of SMXL is inconsistent with the SCF E3 ligase model where MAX2 is required to target SMXL.
