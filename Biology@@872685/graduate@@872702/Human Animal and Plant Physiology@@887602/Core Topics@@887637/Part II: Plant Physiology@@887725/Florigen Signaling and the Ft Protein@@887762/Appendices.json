After the transition from light to dark, synthesis of FT rapidly diminishes due to the light-dependent activity of upstream transcriptional regulators, so that over a short time window the dominant process shaping FT abundance in leaves can be modeled as degradation. Consider a well-mixed leaf compartment in which the FT concentration, denoted $[FT](t)$, evolves after lights-off according to first-order degradation kinetics governed by the ordinary differential equation $d[FT]/dt=-k_{deg}[FT]$, where $k_{deg}$ is a constant degradation rate with units of $\\text{min}^{-1}$.

A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the governing differential equation, which describes first-order degradation:\n$$\n\\frac{d[FT]}{dt} = -k_{deg}[FT]\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{[FT]} d[FT] = -k_{deg} dt\n$$\nTo find the concentration $[FT](t)$ at any time $t \\ge 0$, we integrate both sides. The left side is integrated from the initial concentration $[FT](0)$ to the concentration at time $t$, $[FT](t)$, and the right side is integrated from time $t'=0$ to $t'=t$:\n$$\n\\int_{[FT](0)}^{[FT](t)} \\frac{1}{[FT]'} d[FT]' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k_{deg} dt'\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\n\\big[ \\ln([FT]') \\big]_{[FT](0)}^{[FT](t)} = \\big[ -k_{deg}t' \\big]_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln([FT](t)) - \\ln([FT](0)) = -k_{deg}t - 0\n$$\nThis can be written using the properties of logarithms as:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{[FT](t)}{[FT](0)}\\right) = -k_{deg}t\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the explicit solution for the concentration as a function of time:\n$$\n[FT](t) = [FT](0) \\exp(-k_{deg}t)\n$$\nThis equation describes exponential decay, which is characteristic of any first-order process.\n\nThe problem requires an expression for $k_{deg}$ in terms of the initial and $100$-minute abundances.

Specifically, using the data point at $t=100$ minutes:\n$$\nk_{deg} = \\frac{1}{100} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[FT](0)}{[FT](100)}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values, $[FT](0)=100$ and $[FT](100)=37$, into this expression to calculate $k_{deg}$:\n$$\nk_{deg} = \\frac{1}{100} \\ln\\left(\\frac{100}{37}\\right) \\approx \\frac{1}{100} \\ln(2.70270) \\approx \\frac{0.9942518}{100} \\approx 0.009942518 \\text{ min}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we obtain:\n$$\nk_{deg} \\approx 0.009943 \\text{ min}^{-1}\n$$\nNext, we derive the half-life, $t_{1/2}$. By definition, the half-life is the time required for the concentration to decrease to one-half of its initial value. Thus, at $t=t_{1/2}$, we have $[FT](t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}[FT](0)$.

The FT–FD–14-3-3 complex is an activator, while the TFL1–FD–14-3-3 complex is a repressor. The relative abundance of these two complexes determines the net output. Comparing the fractional occupancies, we find that $\\theta_{\\mathrm{FT}} = 0.5$ is greater than $\\theta_{\\mathrm{TFL1}} = 0.375$. This means that at any given moment, $50\\%$ of the FD–14-3-3 modules are bound to the activator FT, while only $37.5\\%$ are bound to the repressor TFL1. Because the concentration of the activator complex is higher than that of the repressor complex, the transcriptional program of activation will predominate. This leads to the expression of floral meristem identity genes, promoting the transition to flowering.\n\nThe problem requires reporting the fractional occupancy by FT, rounded to four significant figures.

The evaluation of the proposed experimental options must be based on established principles of molecular biology, paying strict attention to the inclusion of appropriate controls to ensure the specificity and validity of the conclusions. The biological context is that $CO$ protein levels are high at dusk under Long Day (LD) conditions, promoting $FT$ transcription, and very low under Short Day (SD) conditions, leading to $FT$ repression.\n\nA. This option presents a comprehensive and methodologically sound experimental design.\nFor ChIP-qPCR, the use of a transgenic line expressing $CO$ fused to a Hemagglutinin ($HA$) tag under its native promoter is the gold standard. This allows for specific immunoprecipitation with a high-affinity anti-$HA$ antibody, avoiding the common problem of non-specific antibodies against native proteins. The inclusion of a *co* loss-of-function mutant as a genetic negative control is excellent, as it proves that any signal is dependent on the $CO$ protein. Growing plants under LD and SD and harvesting at Zeitgeber Time (ZT) $16$ is the correct experimental setup to test the hypothesis, as this timing is expected to show the maximal difference in $CO$ protein levels. The procedural details are correct: formaldehyde crosslinking, chromatin shearing to an optimal size of $\\sim$200–500 bp, and, critically, the inclusion of both an Immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotype control (to control for non-specific binding to the antibody/beads) and an input DNA fraction (for normalization). The qPCR analysis strategy is also robust, proposing primers for the target $FT$ promoter versus a `distal intergenic region` as a negative locus control. Normalization using the input fraction (e.g., via percent input or a $\\Delta \\Delta C_t$ method) is the correct quantitative approach. The expected directionality—significantly higher enrichment at $CORE$ sites in LD versus SD, with no enrichment in any of the negative controls (IgG, *co* mutant, negative locus)—is scientifically correct.\nFor EMSA, the design is equally rigorous. Using nuclear extracts from LD-grown ZT $16$ $CO$-$HA$ plants or recombinant $CO$ is appropriate. The use of a labeled oligonucleotide containing a wild-type ($WT$) $CORE$ motif is standard. Crucially, all necessary specificity controls are included: $1$) competition with an excess of unlabeled $WT$ competitor DNA to reduce the shifted band, $2$) lack of competition with a $CORE$-mutated competitor to show sequence specificity, and $3$) a supershift assay with an anti-$HA$ antibody to definitively identify $CO$-$HA$ in the protein-DNA complex. The inclusion of extracts from a *co* mutant as a negative control further solidifies the experiment.\nThis option describes a complete workflow that would provide strong, specific evidence for the hypothesis. **Correct**.\n\nB. This option contains multiple fundamental flaws. Using `wild-type untagged plants` with an `anti-Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)` antibody is nonsensical, as there is no $GFP$ to immunoprecipitate. Harvesting at ZT $4$ is a suboptimal time to test the hypothesis about dusk-dependent activity. The omission of input normalization and an IgG control are critical errors that invalidate any potential results. The expectation of `higher CO occupancy in SD` is scientifically false; $CO$ is an activator, and its occupancy is expected to be lower in SD when $FT$ is repressed. For the EMSA, `ethidium bromide-stained probes` lack the necessary sensitivity. The use of `RNase` as a specificity control is irrelevant for a DNA-protein interaction. The omission of standard competitor and supershift assays makes it impossible to determine specificity. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. This option is fundamentally flawed in its approach and execution. Using a constitutive `$35$S:$CO$ overexpression line` is inappropriate for studying the *native photoperiod-dependent* regulation of $CO$ binding. The absence of genetic and IgG controls invalidates the ChIP experiment. Normalization `by equal volumes` is not a scientifically valid method. The EMSA design is scientifically backward, stating that a `mutated unlabeled competitor` would compete *more* effectively than a $WT$ one, which contradicts the principle of specific binding. The lack of a supershift control is another major omission. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. This option is also deeply flawed. The experimental design for ChIP-qPCR omits the crucial `IgG control`, making it impossible to distinguish specific signal from background. The choice of a `coding exon within FT` as a negative control region is poor, as regions undergoing active transcription can have high non-specific background. The provided time points and comparison groups (lacking SD ZT $16$) are not optimal for testing the central hypothesis. The stated expectations are scientifically incorrect: $CO$ protein is stabilized by light at dusk, so enrichment should be maximal at ZT $16$ in LD, not lower. Furthermore, a large difference in binding is expected between LD ZT $16$ and SD ZT $16$, contrary to what is stated. The EMSA design is incomplete as it lacks both competition and supershift controls, which are essential for demonstrating the specificity of the interaction. **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, Option A is the only choice that describes a scientifically rigorous, internally consistent, and complete experimental plan with all the necessary controls to properly test the hypothesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2569042"}]}
