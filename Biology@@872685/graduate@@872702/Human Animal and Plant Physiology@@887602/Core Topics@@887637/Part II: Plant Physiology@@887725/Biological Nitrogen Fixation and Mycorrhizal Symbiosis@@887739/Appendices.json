We will address each calculation systematically based on the provided reaction stoichiometries and measured rates.\n\nFirst, we determine the total electron flux through the nitrogenase enzyme system.

It presents a standard metabolic modeling scenario based on established biochemical principles and justifiable simplifications. We will proceed to derive the solution from first principles.\n\nThe core principle for solving this problem is the law of conservation of energy, applied here as a steady-state balance between the rate of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production from carbohydrate catabolism and the rate of ATP consumption by nitrogenase, which is assumed to be the sole ATP sink under these carbon-limited conditions.\n\nLet $J_C$ be the flux of carbon atoms into the nodule, given as $300$ nmol C min$^{-1}$ g$^{-1}$. Let $J_{N_2}$ be the maximal rate of dinitrogen fixation in nmol N$_2$ min$^{-1}$ g$^{-1}$, which is the quantity to be determined.\n\nFirst, we must establish the total rate of ATP production, $J_{ATP,prod}$. This rate is the sum of ATP produced through two distinct metabolic processes: substrate-level phosphorylation ($J_{ATP,SLP}$) and oxidative phosphorylation ($J_{ATP,OxPhos}$).\n$$J_{ATP,prod} = J_{ATP,SLP} + J_{ATP,OxPhos}$$\n\nThe rate of ATP production from substrate-level phosphorylation is directly proportional to the carbon flux. The problem states that complete oxidation of a hexose ($6$ carbon atoms) yields $4$ molecules of ATP via this mechanism. The yield of ATP from substrate-level phosphorylation per carbon atom, $Y_{SLP}$, is therefore:\n$$Y_{SLP} = \\frac{4 \\text{ ATP}}{6 \\text{ C}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ ATP per C}$$\nThe rate of ATP production via this pathway is then:\n$$J_{ATP,SLP} = J_C \\times Y_{SLP} = J_C \\times \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nNext, we determine the rate of ATP production from oxidative phosphorylation. This process is driven by the flow of electrons to a terminal acceptor, which is $\\text{O}_2$. The problem specifies that the oxidation of a carbohydrate carbon atom (average oxidation state $0$) to carbon dioxide (oxidation state $+4$) liberates $4$ electrons, which corresponds to $2$ electron pairs. Thus, the yield of electron pairs per carbon atom, $Y_{e-/C}$, is:\n$$Y_{e-/C} = 2 \\text{ electron pairs per C}$$\nThe rate of electron pair generation, $J_{e-,pair}$, is proportional to the carbon flux:\n$$J_{e-,pair} = J_C \\times Y_{e-/C} = 2 J_C$$\nThe efficiency of ATP synthesis during this process is given by the P/O ratio, $R_{P/O}$, which is the number of ATP molecules synthesized per electron pair transferred to oxygen. The problem gives this value as $R_{P/O} = 2.0$. The rate of ATP production from oxidative phosphorylation is therefore:\n$$J_{ATP,OxPhos} = J_{e-,pair} \\times R_{P/O} = (2 J_C) \\times 2.0 = 4 J_C$$\n\nWe can now express the total rate of ATP production by summing the contributions from both pathways:\n$$J_{ATP,prod} = J_{ATP,SLP} + J_{ATP,OxPhos} = \\frac{2}{3} J_C + 4 J_C = \\left(\\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{12}{3}\\right) J_C = \\frac{14}{3} J_C$$\nThis composite term, $\\frac{14}{3}$, represents the total yield of ATP per carbon atom completely oxidized in the nodule.\n\nNow, we formulate the rate of ATP consumption, $J_{ATP,cons}$. The problem dictates that we neglect all ATP costs other than the nitrogenase reaction. The molar ATP requirement for the reduction of one molecule of dinitrogen ($\\text{N}_2$) is given as $C_{ATP/N_2} = 16$. The total rate of ATP consumption is the product of the nitrogen fixation rate, $J_{N_2}$, and this specific cost:\n$$J_{ATP,cons} = J_{N_2} \\times C_{ATP/N_2} = 16 J_{N_2}$$\n\nTo find the maximal nitrogen fixation rate, we equate the total rate of production to the total rate of consumption:\n$$J_{ATP,prod} = J_{ATP,cons}$$\n$$\\frac{14}{3} J_C = 16 J_{N_2}$$\n\nWe solve this equation for $J_{N_2}$:\n$$J_{N_2} = \\frac{1}{16} \\times \\frac{14}{3} J_C = \\frac{14}{48} J_C = \\frac{7}{24} J_C$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the maximal nitrogen fixation rate under the stated assumptions.\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical value for the carbon flux, $J_C = 300$ nmol C min$^{-1}$ g$^{-1}$, into our derived expression:\n$$J_{N_2} = \\frac{7}{24} \\times 300 \\text{ nmol min}^{-1} \\text{g}^{-1}$$\nWe perform the calculation:\n$$J_{N_2} = \\frac{2100}{24} = \\frac{1050}{12} = \\frac{525}{6} = \\frac{175}{2} = 87.5$$\nThe resulting maximal nitrogen fixation rate is $87.5$ nmol N$_2$ min$^{-1}$ g$^{-1}$.
