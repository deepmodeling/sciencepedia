All parameters and assumptions are clearly defined, and the data provided are physically reasonable. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\n(a) Derivation and computation of daily Zn delivery, $J$.\n\nThe problem defines the total daily zinc (Zn) delivery to the shoot, $J$, as the time-integral of the advective solute flux over a $24$-hour period. Let $T$ represent the duration of one day, i.e., $T = 24\\,\\text{h}$. The expression for $J$ is given as:\n$$J = \\int_{0}^{T} C_{x}(t) F(t)\\,dt$$\nwhere $C_{x}(t)$ is the instantaneous Zn concentration in the xylem sap and $F(t)$ is the instantaneous volumetric flow of xylem water.\n\nThe problem states that the xylem Zn concentration is approximately time-invariant over the daily timescale. This can be expressed as:\n$$C_{x}(t) = C_{x} = \\text{constant}$$\nGiven this condition, the constant $C_{x}$ can be moved outside of the integral:\n$$J = C_{x} \\int_{0}^{T} F(t)\\,dt$$\nThe problem also defines the total daily transpired water volume, $E$, as the time-integral of the instantaneous flow rate $F(t)$ over the same period:\n$$E = \\int_{0}^{T} F(t)\\,dt$$\nBy substituting the definition of $E$ into the expression for $J$, we arrive at the desired relationship between total solute delivery, solute concentration, and total water flow:\n$$J = C_{x} E$$\nThis equation demonstrates that under the assumption of a constant xylem solute concentration, the total amount of solute delivered to the shoot is directly proportional to the total volume of water transpired.\n\nWe are given the following numerical values:\n$$E = 0.35\\,\\text{L day}^{-1}$$\n$$C_{x} = 25\\,\\mu\\text{mol L}^{-1}$$\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $J$:\n$$J = (25\\,\\mu\\text{mol L}^{-1}) \\times (0.35\\,\\text{L day}^{-1})$$\n$$J = 8.75\\,\\mu\\text{mol day}^{-1}$$\n\n(b) Calculation of Zn delivery under drought conditions, $J_{\\text{closed}}$, and mechanistic explanation.\n\nThe drought episode causes partial stomatal closure, which reduces the daily transpired water volume, $E$, by a fraction of $0.40$. The new transpired water volume, $E_{\\text{closed}}$, is therefore:\n$$E_{\\text{closed}} = E - 0.40 E = (1 - 0.40)E = 0.60 E$$\nSubstituting the value of $E$:\n$$E_{\\text{closed}} = 0.60 \\times (0.35\\,\\text{L day}^{-1}) = 0.21\\,\\text{L day}^{-1}$$\nThe problem states that the xylem concentration $C_{x}$ remains unchanged during this period. The new daily Zn delivery, $J_{\\text{closed}}$, can be calculated using the same formula derived in part (a), but with the new transpiration volume $E_{\\text{closed}}$:\n$$J_{\\text{closed}} = C_{x} E_{\\text{closed}}$$\nSubstituting the values for $C_{x}$ and $E_{\\text{closed}}$:\n$$J_{\\text{closed}} = (25\\,\\mu\\text{mol L}^{-1}) \\times (0.21\\,\\text{L day}^{-1})$$\n$$J_{\\text{closed}} = 5.25\\,\\mu\\text{mol day}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $5.25$ already has three significant figures.\n\nThe mechanistic explanation for the change in $J$ is as follows. The movement of dissolved solutes such as Zn from the roots to the shoots occurs primarily through bulk flow, or advection, within the xylem water. This process is known as the transpiration stream. The driving force for this water flow is the tension created by the evaporation of water from leaf surfaces, a process called transpiration, which is regulated by the opening and closing of stomata.\n\nWhen the plant experiences drought, it closes its stomata to conserve water. This stomatal closure reduces the rate of transpiration, which in turn reduces the overall volumetric flow of water, $F(t)$, through the xylem. According to the mass transport model $J = \\int C_{x}(t) F(t)\\,dt$, the total solute flux is directly coupled to the water flux. Based on the problem's simplifying assumption that the xylem Zn concentration $C_{x}$ is not affected by the change in water flow, a reduction in the total transpired water volume $E = \\int F(t)\\,dt$ must lead to a proportional reduction in the total amount of Zn, $J$, delivered to the shoot.
