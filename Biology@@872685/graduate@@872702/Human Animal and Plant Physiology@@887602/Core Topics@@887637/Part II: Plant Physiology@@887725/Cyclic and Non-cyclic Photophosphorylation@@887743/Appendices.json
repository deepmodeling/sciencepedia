The increase in $\\mathrm{NPQ}$ from $\\approx 0.364$ to $\\approx 0.429$ reflects an increase in the thylakoid lumen proton gradient ($pmf$).

The simultaneous decrease in PSI acceptor-side limitation ($\\mathrm{Y(NA)}$ from $0.15$ to $0.10$) indicates that the ultimate electron acceptor, NADP$^+$, is available, and the Calvin-Benson cycle is active. This high demand for ATP relative to NADPH is balanced by increased engagement of cyclic electron flow (CEF) around PSI, which pumps protons to generate ATP without reducing NADP$^+$. The statement correctly notes that PAM fluorescence cannot quantify CEF by itself.

First, the relationship between $\\mathrm{NPQ}$ and CEF is complex and indirect; a specific fractional correspondence is baseless. Second, the formula provided, $\\mathrm{CEF} = \\mathrm{Y(NPQ)} \\cdot I \\cdot a \\cdot (1 - f_{II})$, is nonsensical. $\\mathrm{Y(NPQ)}$ is a quantum yield of energy *dissipation*, not electron transport. Multiplying a dissipation yield by incident light to get an electron flux is conceptually wrong. CEF is an electron transport pathway, not a thermal dissipation pathway. The formula is a fabrication with no scientific basis.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.

First, the formula for the effective quantum yield of PSII is $\\mathrm{Y(II)} = (F_m' - F_s)/F_m'$, not $(F_m - F_s)/F_m$. The latter is an incorrect parameter that mixes dark-adapted and light-adapted states. Second, the statement claims the yields \"increase with light\", but its own calculated values show a decrease from $\\approx 0.587$ to $\\approx 0.413$. This is a self-contradiction. Third, it fundamentally misinterprets the PSI parameters: $\\mathrm{Y(ND)}$ signifies *donor-side* limitation (insufficient electrons to reduce P700$^+$), not acceptor-side over-reduction.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Since $\\mathrm{Y(II)}$ decreases from L1 to L2, $\\mathrm{ETR(II)}$ must also decrease; therefore LEF is necessarily lower at L2 than L1. The increase in $\\mathrm{Y(ND)}$ indicates acceptor-side limitation at PSI rather than donor-side limitation.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This statement exhibits flawed logic and misinterpretation. While $\\mathrm{Y(II)}$ (the efficiency) decreases from $\\approx 0.436$ to $\\approx 0.162$, the total rate of electron transport, $\\mathrm{ETR(II)}$, is the product of this yield and the light intensity, $I$. As $I$ increases fourfold, the product $\\mathrm{ETR(II)}$ increases from $\\approx 55.6$ to $\\approx 82.6$. Thus, the conclusion that $\\mathrm{ETR(II)}$ and LEF decrease is false. Furthermore, as in option C, it incorrectly equates donor-side limitation ($\\mathrm{Y(ND)}$) with acceptor-side limitation.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Given the partitioning constraint $\\mathrm{Y(II)} + \\mathrm{Y(NPQ)} + \\mathrm{Y(NO)} = 1$ (lake model), the data imply that $\\mathrm{Y(NO)}$ decreases from L1 to L2, which indicates less constitutive dissipation and thus more electrons diverted to CEF.**\n\n- **Analysis**: The partitioning constraint is correct.
