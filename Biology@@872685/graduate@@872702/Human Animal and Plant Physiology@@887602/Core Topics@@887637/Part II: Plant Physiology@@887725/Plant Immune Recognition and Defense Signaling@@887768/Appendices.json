Task 4: Compute `$I$` for the evaluated `$\\theta$`.\n\nValidation Verdict:\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, rooted in fundamental principles of chemical kinetics and receptor theory. The FLS2–flg22 interaction is a canonical model system in molecular plant pathology. The assumptions, such as single-site binding and excess ligand, are standard simplifications used to derive the Hill-Langmuir isotherm, a cornerstone of biophysical chemistry. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, variables, and parameters for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. No flaws are detected. The problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe derivation begins with the reversible binding reaction:\n$$R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$$\nHere, `$R$` represents the free receptor (FLS2), `$L$` represents the free ligand (flg22), and `$RL$` is the receptor-ligand complex.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of association (forward reaction) is proportional to the concentrations of the reactants:\n$$v_{f} = k_{\\text{on}} [R] [L]$$\nwhere `$k_{\\text{on}}$` is the association rate constant. The rate of dissociation (reverse reaction) is proportional to the concentration of the complex:\n$$v_{r} = k_{\\text{off}} [RL]$$\nwhere `$k_{\\text{off}}$` is the dissociation rate constant.\n\nAt equilibrium, the rate of association equals the rate of dissociation:\n$$v_{f} = v_{r}$$\n$$k_{\\text{on}} [R] [L] = k_{\\text{off}} [RL]$$\n\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, `$K_{d}$`, is defined as the ratio of the dissociation rate constant to the association rate constant:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}}$$\nSubstituting this definition into the equilibrium condition gives:\n$$k_{\\text{on}} [R] [L] = (k_{\\text{on}} K_{d}) [RL]$$\nDividing by `$k_{\\text{on}}$` (which is non-zero) yields the expression for `$K_{d}$` in terms of equilibrium concentrations, as required by the problem statement:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\n\nThe fractional receptor occupancy, `$\\theta$`, is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are bound by the ligand. The total concentration of receptors, `$[R]_{T}$`, is the sum of free receptors, `$[R]$`, and bound receptors, `$[RL]$`:\n$$[R]_{T} = [R] + [RL]$$\nThe fractional occupancy `$\\theta$` is therefore:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{T}} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}$$\nTo express `$\\theta$` in terms of `$[L]$` and `$K_{d}$`, we first rearrange the equilibrium expression to solve for `$[R]$`:\n$$[R] = K_{d} \\frac{[RL]}{[L]}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for `$[R]$` into the denominator of the equation for `$\\theta$`:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{\\left( K_{d} \\frac{[RL]}{[L]} \\right) + [RL]}$$\nAssuming a non-zero ligand concentration, `$[RL]$` is also non-zero, allowing us to factor `$[RL]$` from the denominator and cancel it:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL] \\left( \\frac{K_{d}}{[L]} + 1 \\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{d}}{[L]} + 1}$$\nTo simplify, we multiply the numerator and denominator by `$[L]$`:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d} + [L]}$$\nThis completes the required derivation. This is the Hill-Langmuir equation for a system with a Hill coefficient of `$1$`.\n\nNext, we evaluate `$\\theta$` for the given parameters: `$[L] = 10 \\text{ nM}$` and `$K_{d} = 1 \\text{ nM}$`. The units are consistent and will cancel.\n$$\\theta = \\frac{10}{1 + 10} = \\frac{10}{11}$$\nThis is the exact value for the fractional occupancy.\n\nFinally, we compute the binary signaling outcome `$I$`, which is governed by the Heaviside step rule `$I=1$` if `$\\theta \\ge \\theta_{T}$` and `$I=0$` if `$\\theta < \\theta_{T}$`, with a given threshold `$\\theta_{T} = 0.5$`. We must compare our calculated `$\\theta$` to `$\\theta_{T}$`:\nIs `$\\frac{10}{11} \\ge 0.5$`?\nWe can write `$0.5$` as `$\\frac{1}{2}$`. The inequality is `$\\frac{10}{11} \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$`.\nBy cross-multiplication (as both denominators are positive), we compare `$10 \\times 2$` and `$11 \\times 1$`.\nWe find that `$20 \\ge 11$`, which is a true statement.\nTherefore, the condition `$\\theta \\ge \\theta_{T}$` is met. According to the rule, the signaling outcome is:\n$$I = 1$$\n\nThe requested values are `$\\theta = \\frac{10}{11}$` and `$I = 1$`.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{10}{11} & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2598274"}, {"introduction": "Once a receptor is engaged, the signal's intensity is not guaranteed; it is often shaped by the availability of other essential signaling partners.

It is well-posed and contains no contradictions or ambiguities. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds from the fundamental principles laid out in the problem statement.\n\nThe first principle states that the concentration of active downstream kinase, $[E]$, scales linearly with the concentration of the limiting co-receptor, BAK1. Let $[\\text{BAK1}]$ represent the concentration of BAK1. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$[E] = \\alpha [\\text{BAK1}]$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a constant of proportionality that encapsulates factors such as receptor-ligand affinity, complex formation stoichiometry, and activation efficiency, which are assumed to be constant as per the problem statement.\n\nThe second principle is the linear catalytic law for the signaling output rate, $v$:\n$$v = k [E]$$\nwhere $k$ is the catalytic rate constant.\n\nWe must analyze two states: the baseline (wild type) state, denoted by subscript $0$, and the modified state, denoted by a prime superscript ($'$).\n\nFor the baseline state, we have:\n$$[E]_0 = \\alpha [\\text{BAK1}]_0$$\n$$v_0 = k [E]_0$$\nThe given values are $[E]_0 = 100~\\mathrm{nM}$ and $k = 1~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nFor the modified state, the problem specifies a $5$-fold decrease in BAK1 expression. This translates to a change in its concentration:\n$$[\\text{BAK1}]' = \\frac{1}{5} [\\text{BAK1}]_0$$\nSince all other components are unchanged, the constants $\\alpha$ and $k$ remain the same.
