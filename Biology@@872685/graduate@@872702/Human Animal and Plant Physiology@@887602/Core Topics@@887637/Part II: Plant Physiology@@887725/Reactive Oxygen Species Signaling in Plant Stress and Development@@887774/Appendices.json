Consider a single-cell compartment model for the hydrogen peroxide concentration $H(t)$ governed by a mass balance with constant production by Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homolog (RBOH) activity and enzymatic detoxification following Michaelis–Menten kinetics, along with first-order non-enzymatic decay.

Do not include units in the final answer. No numerical evaluation or rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and stability analysis of the positive steady state of a system described by the ordinary differential equation for hydrogen peroxide concentration, $H(t)$. The governing equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dH}{dt} = P - \\frac{V_{\\max} H}{K_M + H} - kH $$\nAll parameters $P$, $V_{\\max}$, $K_M$, and $k$ are defined as strictly positive constants, and the concentration $H(t)$ must be non-negative, i.e., $H(t) \\ge 0$.\n\nFirst, we determine the steady-state concentration, denoted as $H^{\\ast}$, by setting the time derivative $\\frac{dH}{dt}$ to zero. A steady state must satisfy the condition:\n$$ f(H^{\\ast}) = P - \\frac{V_{\\max} H^{\\ast}}{K_M + H^{\\ast}} - kH^{\\ast} = 0 $$\nTo solve for $H^{\\ast}$, we rearrange this algebraic equation. First, we isolate the Michaelis-Menten term:\n$$ P - kH^{\\ast} = \\frac{V_{\\max} H^{\\ast}}{K_M + H^{\\ast}} $$\nAssuming $K_M + H^{\\ast} \\neq 0$, which is true since $K_M > 0$ and $H^{\\ast} \\ge 0$, we can multiply both sides by $(K_M + H^{\\ast})$:\n$$ (P - kH^{\\ast})(K_M + H^{\\ast}) = V_{\\max} H^{\\ast} $$\nExpanding the left side yields:\n$$ PK_M + PH^{\\ast} - kK_M H^{\\ast} - k(H^{\\ast})^2 = V_{\\max} H^{\\ast} $$\nThis equation can be rearranged into a standard quadratic form $a(H^{\\ast})^2 + bH^{\\ast} + c = 0$:\n$$ k(H^{\\ast})^2 + (V_{\\max} + kK_M - P)H^{\\ast} - PK_M = 0 $$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $H^{\\ast}$ with coefficients:\n$a = k$\n$b = V_{\\max} + kK_M - P$\n$c = -PK_M$\n\nThe solutions for $H^{\\ast}$ are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$ H^{\\ast} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$\nSubstituting the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$:\n$$ H^{\\ast} = \\frac{-(V_{\\max} + kK_M - P) \\pm \\sqrt{(V_{\\max} + kK_M - P)^2 - 4(k)(-PK_M)}}{2k} $$\n$$ H^{\\ast} = \\frac{P - V_{\\max} - kK_M \\pm \\sqrt{(V_{\\max} + kK_M - P)^2 + 4kPK_M}}{2k} $$\nTo determine the physically meaningful solution, we must ensure $H^{\\ast} \\ge 0$. Let us analyze the roots. The discriminant, $\\Delta = (V_{\\max} + kK_M - P)^2 + 4kPK_M$, is strictly positive because $(V_{\\max} + kK_M - P)^2 \\ge 0$ and all parameters $k$, $P$, $K_M$ are strictly positive, implying $4kPK_M > 0$. Therefore, there are always two distinct real roots.\n\nThe product of the roots is given by $H_1 H_2 = \\frac{c}{a} = \\frac{-PK_M}{k}$. Since $P>0$, $K_M>0$, and $k>0$, the product of the roots is strictly negative. This means that one root must be positive and the other must be negative. We seek the unique positive steady state.\nSince the \"plus\" option in the quadratic formula must yield a positive value and the \"minus\" option must yield a negative one, the unique positive root is:\n$$ H^{\\ast} = \\frac{P - V_{\\max} - kK_M + \\sqrt{(V_{\\max} + kK_M - P)^2 + 4kPK_M}}{2k} $$\n\nNext, we perform a linear stability analysis of this steady state. For a one-dimensional autonomous system $\\dot{H} = f(H)$, the stability of a steady state $H^{\\ast}$ is determined by the sign of the Jacobian, $J(H^{\\ast})$, where $J(H) = \\frac{df}{dH}$. A negative Jacobian indicates a stable steady state.\n\nThe function $f(H)$ is:\n$$ f(H) = P - \\frac{V_{\\max} H}{K_M + H} - kH $$\nWe compute its derivative with respect to $H$:\n$$ J(H) = \\frac{df}{dH} = \\frac{d}{dH}\\left(P - \\frac{V_{\\max} H}{K_M + H} - kH\\right) $$\nUsing the quotient rule for the Michaelis-Menten term:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dH}\\left(\\frac{V_{\\max} H}{K_M + H}\\right) = V_{\\max} \\frac{1 \\cdot (K_M + H) - H \\cdot 1}{(K_M + H)^2} = \\frac{V_{\\max} K_M}{(K_M + H)^2} $$\nThe full expression for the Jacobian is:\n$$ J(H) = -\\frac{V_{\\max} K_M}{(K_M + H)^2} - k $$\nNow, we evaluate the Jacobian at the positive steady state $H^{\\ast}$:\n$$ J(H^{\\ast}) = -\\frac{V_{\\max} K_M}{(K_M + H^{\\ast})^2} - k $$\nAccording to the problem statement, all parameters $V_{\\max}$, $K_M$, and $k$ are strictly positive. We have also shown that $H^{\\ast}$ is a positive concentration.\nTherefore, the term $\\frac{V_{\\max} K_M}{(K_M + H^{\\ast})^2}$ is strictly positive, making $-\\frac{V_{\\max} K_M}{(K_M + H^{\\ast})^2}$ strictly negative. The term $-k$ is also strictly negative.\nThe Jacobian $J(H^{\\ast})$ is the sum of two strictly negative terms. Thus, its sign is unambiguously negative:\n$$ J(H^{\\ast}) < 0 $$\nSince the Jacobian evaluated at the steady state is negative, we conclude that the unique positive steady state $H^{\\ast}$ is linearly stable. This means that small perturbations from this steady state will decay, and the system will return to the concentration $H^{\\ast}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{P - V_{\\max} - kK_M + \\sqrt{(V_{\\max} + kK_M - P)^2 + 4PK_M k}}{2k}} $$", "id": "2602293"}, {"introduction": "The biological impact of a ROS signal is not just determined by its concentration, but also by its location and how far it can travel before being scavenged.

The de-esterified probe ($\\mathrm{H_2DCF}$) can become trapped in various subcellular compartments, including mitochondria, so organellar ROS can contribute to the signal. Furthermore, the claim that `no imaging or spectral controls for probe photo-oxidation are required` is profoundly wrong.
