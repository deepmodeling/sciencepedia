The function $y=J$ is strictly increasing. The function $y=G(J)$ is a product of two positive, strictly decreasing functions of $J$ for $J \\geq 0$, and is therefore itself strictly decreasing. At $J=0$, the value is $G(0) = \\frac{2.0}{(1+10^{-0.3})(1)} \\approx \\frac{2.0}{1+0.5012} \\approx 1.332 > 0$. Since $G(0) > 0$ and $G(J)$ decreases while $J$ increases, there must be exactly one positive intersection point, corresponding to the unique positive steady-state solution.\n\nThis equation is solved using a numerical root-finding algorithm or by iteration. An iterative approach $J_{n+1} = G(J_{n})$ will converge to the solution.\nLet's start with a guess $J_{0} = 1.0$:\n$J_{1} = G(1.0) = \\frac{2.0}{(1+10^{-0.1})(1.5)} \\approx \\frac{2.0}{(1.5849)(1.5)} \\approx 0.840$\n$J_{2} = G(0.840) = \\frac{2.0}{(1+10^{-0.30+0.168})(1+0.420)} = \\frac{2.0}{(1+10^{-0.132})(1.420)} \\approx \\frac{2.0}{(1.737)(1.420)} \\approx 0.810$\n$J_{3} = G(0.810) = \\frac{2.0}{(1+10^{-0.30+0.162})(1+0.405)} = \\frac{2.0}{(1+10^{-0.138})(1.405)} \\approx \\frac{2.0}{(1.7298)(1.405)} \\approx 0.821$\nContinuing this iteration until convergence yields a stable value.\nA precise numerical solver finds the root of $J - G(J) = 0$ to be $J \\approx 0.81959...$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$J \\approx 0.820 \\, \\text{mM min}^{-1}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.820}$$", "id": "2548531"}]}
