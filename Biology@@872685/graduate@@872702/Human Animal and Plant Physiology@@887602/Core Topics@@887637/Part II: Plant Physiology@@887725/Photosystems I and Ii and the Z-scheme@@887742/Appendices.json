The problem provides the following key parameters for this molecular machine:\n1.  The stoichiometry of the $c$-ring is $c_{14}$, meaning it is composed of $n_c = 14$ subunits.\n2.  Each $c$-subunit translocates one proton ($\\mathrm{H}^+$) for a full $360^{\\circ}$ rotation.

Using only the above stoichiometric bases, derive the expression for the ATP/NADPH production ratio in terms of the fluxes and stoichiometries, and compute the required fractional cyclic flux $r = C/L$ that achieves the target ratio. Express your final answer as a dimensionless number rounded to $3$ significant figures. No units are required in the final answer.", "solution": "The objective is to determine the fractional cyclic electron flux, $r = C/L$, that satisfies the condition of producing adenosine triphosphate ($ATP$) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ($NADPH$) in a specific molar ratio. Let $L$ be the rate of linear electron flow (in electrons per unit time) and $C$ be the rate of cyclic electron flow (in electrons per unit time). We will proceed by establishing the rates of production for $NADPH$ and $ATP$ as functions of $L$ and $C$.\n\nFirst, we determine the rate of $NADPH$ production, which we denote as $J_{\\text{NADPH}}$. The reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ($NADP^+$) to $NADPH$ occurs exclusively at the terminus of the linear electron flow ($LEF$) pathway. According to the provided stoichiometry (i), the transfer of $2$ electrons is required for the synthesis of one molecule of $NADPH$. The flux of electrons along the linear path is $L$. Therefore, the rate of $NADPH$ production is directly proportional to half the linear electron flux:\n$$J_{\\text{NADPH}} = \\frac{L}{2}$$\n\nNext, we determine the rate of $ATP$ production, $J_{\\text{ATP}}$. This rate is driven by the proton motive force, which is generated by the translocation of protons ($H^+$) across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. The total rate of proton translocation, $J_{H^+,\\text{total}}$, is the sum of contributions from Photosystem II ($PSII$) and the cytochrome $b_6f$ complex (cyt $b_6f$).\n\nThe contribution from $PSII$ is coupled to the oxidation of water, which occurs only in $LEF$. According to stoichiometry (ii), $1$ proton is translocated into the lumen for each electron extracted from water. The electron flux through $PSII$ is equal to the linear flux, $L$. Thus, the rate of proton translocation by $PSII$ is:\n$$J_{H^+, PSII} = 1 \\cdot L = L$$\n\nThe contribution from the cyt $b_6f$ complex is due to the $Q$-cycle mechanism. The problem states that cyt $b_6f$ is traversed by electrons from both $LEF$ and cyclic electron flow ($CEF$). The total electron flux through cyt $b_6f$ is the sum of the linear flux $L$ and the cyclic flux $C$. According to stoichiometry (iii), the $Q$-cycle translocates $2$ protons into the lumen for each electron that passes through the complex. Therefore, the rate of proton translocation by cyt $b_6f$ is:\n$$J_{H^+, \\text{cyt } b_6f} = 2 \\cdot (L + C)$$\n\nThe total rate of proton translocation into the lumen is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$J_{H^+, \\text{total}} = J_{H^+, PSII} + J_{H^+, \\text{cyt } b_6f} = L + 2(L + C) = 3L + 2C$$\n\nThe synthesis of $ATP$ by the $ATP$ synthase complex is driven by this proton flux. According to stoichiometry (iv), the number of protons required to synthesize one molecule of $ATP$ (the $H^+/ATP$ ratio) is given by $n_c/3$, where $n_c$ is the number of subunits in the $c$-ring of the synthase. With the given value $n_c=14$, the cost is $14/3$ protons per $ATP$. The rate of $ATP$ synthesis is the total proton flux divided by this cost:\n$$J_{\\text{ATP}} = \\frac{J_{H^+, \\text{total}}}{H^+/\\text{ATP}} = \\frac{3L + 2C}{n_c/3} = \\frac{3(3L + 2C)}{n_c}$$\n\nNow we can construct the expression for the $ATP/NADPH$ production ratio by dividing $J_{\\text{ATP}}$ by $J_{\\text{NADPH}}$:\n$$\\frac{J_{\\text{ATP}}}{J_{\\text{NADPH}}} = \\frac{\\frac{3(3L + 2C)}{n_c}}{\\frac{L}{2}} = \\frac{6(3L + 2C)}{n_c L}$$\n\nTo express this ratio in terms of the fractional cyclic flux, $r = C/L$, we divide the numerator and the denominator of the expression inside the parentheses by $L$:\n$$\\frac{J_{\\text{ATP}}}{J_{\\text{NADPH}}} = \\frac{6(3 + 2(C/L))}{n_c} = \\frac{6(3 + 2r)}{n_c}$$\nThis is the general expression for the ATP/NADPH ratio as a function of $r$ and $n_c$.\n\nThe problem specifies a target biochemical demand where this ratio is $1.5$, or $3/2$. We are given $n_c = 14$. We set our derived expression equal to the target value and solve for $r$:\n$$\\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{6(3 + 2r)}{14}$$\nThis equation can be simplified. Dividing both sides by $3$ and simplifying the fraction on the right-hand side gives:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2(3 + 2r)}{14} = \\frac{3 + 2r}{7}$$\nNow, we solve for $r$.
