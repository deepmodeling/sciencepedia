The provided physical parameters are realistic for a typical leaf. The problem is well-posed, containing all necessary information and clear definitions for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be presented.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of stomatal conductance in velocity units, $g_s$.\nWe begin with Fick's first law for one-dimensional, steady-state diffusion. The molar flux of water vapor, $J$ (in units of mol s$^{-1}$), through a single cylindrical pore is given by:\n$$J_{\\text{pore}} = -A_{\\text{pore}} D_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} \\frac{dC}{dz}$$\nwhere $A_{\\text{pore}} = \\pi r_p^2$ is the cross-sectional area of a single pore, $C$ is the molar concentration of water vapor, and $z$ is the position along the pore axis. We integrate this expression over the length of the pore, $l_p$, from the intercellular airspace (where concentration is $C_{\\text{int}}$) to the pore mouth (where concentration is $C_{\\text{ext}}$):\n$$\\int_{0}^{l_p} J_{\\text{pore}} dz = -\\int_{C_{\\text{int}}}^{C_{\\text{ext}}} A_{\\text{pore}} D_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} dC$$\nAssuming $J_{\\text{pore}}$, $A_{\\text{pore}}$, and $D_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$ are constant along the pore:\n$$J_{\\text{pore}} l_p = -A_{\\text{pore}} D_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} (C_{\\text{ext}} - C_{\\text{int}})$$\n$$J_{\\text{pore}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{pore}} D_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}{l_p} (C_{\\text{int}} - C_{\\text{ext}})$$\nThe total molar flux per unit leaf area, $F$ (in $\\mathrm{mol}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$), is the flux per pore multiplied by the stomatal density, $n$:\n$$F = n J_{\\text{pore}} = n \\frac{A_{\\text{pore}} D_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}{l_p} (C_{\\text{int}} - C_{\\text{ext}})$$\nConductance is defined as flux per unit concentration difference. The velocity-form conductance, $g_s$ (in $\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$), is defined by the relation $F = g_s \\Delta C$. Comparing this with our derived expression for flux:\n$$F = g_s (C_{\\text{int}} - C_{\\text{ext}})$$\nWe identify $g_s$ as:\n$$g_s = n \\frac{A_{\\text{pore}} D_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}{l_p} = \\frac{n \\pi r_p^2 D_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}{l_p}$$\nThis is the required expression for stomatal conductance per unit leaf area in velocity units.\n\nPart 2: Conversion to molar-form conductance, $g_{sw}$.\nThe molar-form conductance, $g_{sw}$ (in $\\mathrm{mol}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$), is defined with respect to the mole fraction difference, $\\Delta x$, such that:\n$$F = g_{sw} (x_{\\text{int}} - x_{\\text{ext}})$$\nWe have two expressions for the same flux $F$:\n$$F = g_s (C_{\\text{int}} - C_{\\text{ext}})$$\n$$F = g_{sw} (x_{\\text{int}} - x_{\\text{ext}})$$\nEquating these gives the relationship between $g_s$ and $g_{sw}$:\n$$g_{sw} = g_s \\frac{C_{\\text{int}} - C_{\\text{ext}}}{x_{\\text{int}} - x_{\\text{ext}}} = g_s \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta x}$$\nTo find the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta x}$, we use the ideal gas law, $PV = NRT$. Molar concentration, $C_{\\text{all}} = \\frac{N}{V} = \\frac{P}{RT}$, is the total molar concentration of all gas molecules in the air. The molar concentration of water vapor, $C_w$, is related to its mole fraction, $x_w$, by $C_w = x_w C_{\\text{all}}$.\nTherefore, $C_w = x_w \\frac{P}{RT}$.\nAssuming total pressure $P$ and temperature $T$ are constant, the ratio of concentration difference to mole fraction difference is:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta C_w}{\\Delta x_w} = \\frac{P}{RT}$$\nSubstituting this into our relationship for conductances:\n$$g_{sw} = g_s \\left(\\frac{P}{RT}\\right)$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value. First, all parameters must be in SI units.\n$n=300$ mm$^{-2} = 300 \\times (10^{-3} \\text{ m})^{-2} = 300 \\times 10^6 \\text{ m}^{-2} = 3 \\times 10^8$ m$^{-2}$.\n$r_p=2\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 2 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n$l_p=10\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 1 \\times 10^{-5}$ m.\nThe values for $D_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$, $P$, $R$, and $T$ are already given in appropriate SI units.\n\nFirst, we calculate $g_s$:\n$$g_s = \\frac{(3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m}^{-2}) \\pi (2 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m})^2 (2.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ m}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1})}{1 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ m}}$$\n$$g_s = (3 \\times 10^8) \\pi (4 \\times 10^{-12}) (2.5) \\text{ m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1} = 30 \\pi \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1} = 3\\pi \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}$$\n$g_s \\approx 0.00942477\\ \\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the conversion factor $\\frac{P}{RT}$:\n$$\\frac{P}{RT} = \\frac{1.01325 \\times 10^5 \\text{ Pa}}{(8.314462618 \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{mol}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{K}^{-1})(298.15 \\text{ K})} \\approx \\frac{1.01325 \\times 10^5}{2478.955} \\text{ mol}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-3}$$\n$$\\frac{P}{RT} \\approx 40.8742\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$$\n\nFinally, we compute $g_{sw}$:\n$$g_{sw} = g_s \\left(\\frac{P}{RT}\\right) \\approx (0.00942477\\ \\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(40.8742\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-3})$$\n$$g_{sw} \\approx 0.38523\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we obtain $g_{sw} = 0.385\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.385}\n$$", "id": "2552604"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the leaf interior to the outside, the next major hurdle for water vapor is the boundary layer, a thin sheath of relatively still air clinging to the leaf surface.

It presents a standard problem in fluid mechanics and mass transfer, directly applicable to plant ecophysiology. The problem is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. The assumption of a laminar boundary layer is physically justified by the conditions provided. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we must confirm the validity of the laminar flow assumption. This is done by calculating the Reynolds number at the trailing edge of the plate, $x=L$. The Reynolds number, $Re_L$, is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the flow regime, defined as:\n$$Re_L = \\frac{UL}{\\nu}$$\nSubstituting the given values: the free-stream velocity $U = 1\\ \\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, the chord length $L = 0.05\\ \\mathrm{m}$, and the kinematic viscosity of air $\\nu = 1.5\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$:\n$$Re_L = \\frac{(1\\ \\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.05\\ \\mathrm{m})}{1.5\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.05}{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 3333$$\nThe calculated Reynolds number $Re_L \\approx 3.3 \\times 10^3$ is substantially lower than the critical Reynolds number for the transition from laminar to turbulent flow over a smooth flat plate, which is typically taken as $Re_{crit} \\approx 5 \\times 10^5$. Therefore, the problem's assumption that the boundary layer remains laminar over the entire chord length is physically correct.\n\nAccording to classical boundary-layer theory for laminar flow over a flat plate (the Blasius solution), the hydrodynamic boundary-layer thickness, $\\delta(x)$, at a distance $x$ from the leading edge is commonly defined as the distance from the surface at which the fluid velocity reaches $99\\%$ of the free-stream velocity $U$. This thickness is given by the formula:\n$$\\delta(x) \\approx 5.0 \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{Re_x}}$$\nwhere $Re_x = \\frac{Ux}{\\nu}$ is the local Reynolds number. We can express $\\delta(x)$ directly in terms of the physical parameters by substituting the definition of $Re_x$:\n$$\\delta(x) = 5.0 \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{\\frac{Ux}{\\nu}}} = 5.0 \\sqrt{\\frac{x^2 \\nu}{Ux}} = 5.0 \\sqrt{\\frac{x\\nu}{U}}$$\nThe problem requires the calculation of this thickness at the trailing edge of the leaf, where $x=L$. Thus, we evaluate the expression at $L$:\n$$\\delta(L) = 5.0 \\sqrt{\\frac{L\\nu}{U}}$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$$\\delta(L) = 5.0 \\sqrt{\\frac{(0.05\\ \\mathrm{m})(1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1})}{1\\ \\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}}$$\n$$\\delta(L) = 5.0 \\sqrt{7.5 \\times 10^{-7}}\\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 5.0 \\times (8.66025 \\times 10^{-4})\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n$$\\delta(L) \\approx 4.330125 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested, we obtain the numerical value for the boundary-layer thickness:\n$$\\delta(L) \\approx 4.33 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n\nNext, we provide a qualitative explanation of how the hydrodynamic boundary-layer thickness $\\delta$ influences the boundary layer conductance to water vapor, $g_b$.\nThe transport of water vapor from the humid interior of the leaf, through the stomata, and across the adjacent boundary layer into the ambient air is a process of molecular diffusion. Fick's first law of diffusion states that the flux of a substance is proportional to its concentration gradient. In the context of transport across a boundary layer, the water vapor flux, $J_{wv}$, is often modeled using a conductance-based framework, analogous to Ohm's law:\n$$J_{wv} = g_b (C_s - C_a)$$\nHere, $C_s$ is the concentration of water vapor at the leaf surface (assumed saturated), $C_a$ is the concentration in the free air stream, and $g_b$ is the boundary layer conductance.\nFrom a more fundamental perspective, by applying Fick's law across the concentration boundary layer of thickness $\\delta_c$ and approximating the gradient as linear, the flux is:\n$$J_{wv} \\approx D_{wv} \\frac{C_s - C_a}{\\delta_{c}}$$\nwhere $D_{wv}$ is the molecular diffusion coefficient of water vapor in air. By comparing these two expressions for the flux $J_{wv}$, we can identify the relationship for the conductance:\n$$g_b \\approx \\frac{D_{wv}}{\\delta_{c}}$$\nThe thickness of the concentration boundary layer, $\\delta_c$, is directly related to the thickness of the hydrodynamic boundary layer, $\\delta$. For laminar flow, their ratio is a function of the Schmidt number, $Sc = \\nu/D_{wv}$, such that $\\delta_c$ is proportional to $\\delta$. Therefore, it follows that the boundary layer conductance $g_b$ is inversely proportional to the hydrodynamic boundary-layer thickness $\\delta$:\n$$g_b \\propto \\frac{1}{\\delta}$$\nQualitatively, the boundary layer is a layer of relatively still air that clings to the leaf surface. This layer presents a resistance to the diffusion of water vapor molecules from the stomatal pores to the turbulent, well-mixed ambient air. The thickness of this layer, $\\delta$, represents the effective path length that water vapor molecules must traverse by diffusion. A thicker boundary layer (larger $\\delta$) implies a longer diffusion path, leading to higher resistance and, consequently, a lower boundary layer conductance ($g_b$). Conversely, a thinner boundary layer (smaller $\\delta$), typically caused by higher wind speeds, reduces the diffusion path length, lowers resistance, and thereby increases the conductance for water vapor.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4.33 \\times 10^{-3}}\n$$", "id": "2552599"}, {"introduction": "To analyze the complete diffusion pathway from leaf to atmosphere, we must combine stomatal and boundary layer conductances, which act in series.

All data and definitions required for its solution are provided, and it rests on fundamental principles of physics and chemistry applied to physiology. I shall therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for three things: first, to derive the relationship between the two forms of conductance, $g$ and $k_{v}$; second, to explain the physical rationale for preferring $g$ when analyzing series pathways; and third, to perform a numerical conversion.\n\nWe begin with the derivation. The problem provides two equivalent expressions for the steady-state flux density of water vapor, $J$:\n$$J = k_{v}\\,\\Delta C$$\n$$J = g\\,\\Delta \\chi$$\nHere, $\\Delta C$ is the difference in molar concentration and $\\Delta \\chi$ is the difference in mole fraction of water vapor. To relate $g$ and $k_{v}$, we must first relate $C$ and $\\chi$. This is accomplished through the Ideal Gas Law:\n$$PV = nRT$$\nwhere $P$ is the total pressure, $V$ is the volume, $n$ is the total number of moles of gas, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe total molar concentration of air, $C_{\\mathrm{air}}$, is defined as the total moles per unit volume:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{air}} = \\frac{n}{V}$$\nFrom the Ideal Gas Law, we can write this as:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{air}} = \\frac{P}{RT}$$\nNow, consider a single component of the gas mixture, such as water vapor (subscript $w$). Its partial pressure is $P_w$, the number of moles is $n_w$, and its molar concentration is $C_w = n_w/V$. Assuming it also behaves as an ideal gas, we have $P_w V = n_w RT$, which gives:\n$$C_w = \\frac{P_w}{RT}$$\nThe mole fraction of water vapor, $\\chi_w$, is defined by Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures as the ratio of its partial pressure to the total pressure, or equivalently, the ratio of its moles to the total moles:\n$$\\chi_w = \\frac{n_w}{n} = \\frac{P_w}{P}$$\nFrom this, we express the partial pressure as $P_w = \\chi_w P$. Substituting this into the expression for $C_w$:\n$$C_w = \\frac{\\chi_w P}{RT}$$\nBy recognizing that $P/(RT)$ is the total molar concentration of air, $C_{\\mathrm{air}}$, we arrive at the fundamental relationship between species concentration and mole fraction:\n$$C_w = \\chi_w C_{\\mathrm{air}}$$\nThis relationship holds assuming that the total pressure $P$ and temperature $T$ that define $C_{\\mathrm{air}}$ are constant over the region of interest. The difference in concentration, $\\Delta C_w$, is therefore directly proportional to the difference in mole fraction, $\\Delta \\chi_w$:\n$$\\Delta C_w = C_{w,1} - C_{w,2} = \\chi_{w,1}C_{\\mathrm{air}} - \\chi_{w,2}C_{\\mathrm{air}} = (\\chi_{w,1} - \\chi_{w,2})C_{\\mathrm{air}} = \\Delta \\chi_w C_{\\mathrm{air}}$$\nNow we equate the two expressions for the flux $J$:\n$$k_{v}\\,\\Delta C_w = g\\,\\Delta \\chi_w$$\nSubstituting our expression for $\\Delta C_w$:\n$$k_{v}\\,(\\Delta \\chi_w C_{\\mathrm{air}}) = g\\,\\Delta \\chi_w$$\nFor any non-zero flux, $\\Delta \\chi_w \\neq 0$, so we can divide by it to obtain the desired relationship:\n$$g = k_{v} C_{\\mathrm{air}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{\\mathrm{air}}$ yields the full relationship in terms of environmental variables:\n$$g = k_{v} \\frac{P}{RT}$$\n\nNext, we address why $g$ (in units of $\\mathrm{mol}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) is often preferred. The transport of water vapor from the leaf interior to the atmosphere occurs through resistances in series: the stomatal resistance ($r_s$) and the boundary layer resistance ($r_{bl}$). The total resistance is their sum: $R_{\\mathrm{total}} = r_s + r_{bl}$. Conductance is the reciprocal of resistance ($g = 1/r$).\n\nThe core of the issue lies in the physical nature of conductance. From Fick's first law, flux is $J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}$, where $D$ is the molecular diffusivity (units $\\mathrm{m}^2\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). For a path of length $L$, this is approximated as $J = \\frac{D}{L}\\Delta C$. Comparing this to $J = k_v \\Delta C$, we see that $k_v$ is physically equivalent to $D/L$. The diffusivity $D$ for a gas is dependent on temperature and pressure, typically scaling as $D \\propto T^n/P$, where $n \\approx 1.75$ for water vapor in air. Consequently, the conductance $k_v$ is sensitive to local temperature and pressure: $k_v \\propto T^n/P$.\n\nNow, let's examine the conductance $g$. Using our derived relationship:\n$$g = k_v \\frac{P}{RT} \\propto \\frac{T^n}{P} \\frac{P}{RT} = \\frac{T^n}{T} = T^{n-1}$$\nFor $n=1.75$, $g \\propto T^{0.75}$. The conductance $g$ is independent of pressure and has a weaker dependence on temperature than $k_v$. The stomatal pathway and the boundary layer pathway can be at different temperatures. The leaf surface is often warmer or cooler than the ambient air. Using $k_v$ would require specifying the temperature and pressure for each segment of the pathway to define the conductance, which complicates the simple addition of resistances. Because $g$ has these dependencies factored out, it represents a more intrinsic property of the diffusion path geometry. Adding resistances in the form $1/g$ provides a more robust and direct method for analyzing composite pathways where environmental conditions are not uniform.\n\nFinally, we perform the requested calculation.

If I use $P=101 \\text{ kPa}$, this has three significant figures. $g=0.15$ has two. $T=298$ has three.

The reasoning holds.\n\nLet me reconsider my rounding.\nThe number is $0.0036797686...$\nThe first significant digit is $3$.\nThe second significant digit is $6$.\nThe third significant digit is $7$.\nThe fourth significant digit is $9$.\nThe fifth significant digit is $7$.\nSince $7 \\ge 5$, the fourth digit ($9$) must be rounded up.\nRounding $9$ up means it becomes $0$ and the preceding digit ($7$) is incremented.\nSo $...3679...$ becomes $...3680...$.\nThe result is $0.003680$. That is correct.\nThe final answer is $0.003680$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.003680}\n$$", "id": "2552608"}]}
