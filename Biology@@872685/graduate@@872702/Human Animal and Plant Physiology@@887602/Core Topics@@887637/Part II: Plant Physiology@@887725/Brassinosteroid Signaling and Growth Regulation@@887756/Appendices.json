The provided data, including dissociation constants and ligand concentrations, are physically realistic for a biological hormone signaling system. The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary constants and simplifying assumptions (e.g., negligible receptor concentration, mutually exclusive binding) required to determine a unique, stable, and meaningful solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be provided.\n\nThe system under consideration involves a receptor, which we denote as $R$, and two competing ligands, brassinolide ($BL$) and castasterone ($CS$). The binding of these ligands to the receptor is reversible and mutually exclusive. The chemical equilibria are described by the law of mass action.\n\nThe equilibrium for the binding of brassinolide to the receptor is:\n$$R + BL \\rightleftharpoons R\\text{-}BL$$\nwhere $R\\text{-}BL$ is the receptor-ligand complex. The equilibrium dissociation constant for this reaction, denoted $K_{d,BL}$, is defined as:\n$$K_{d,BL} = \\frac{[R][BL]}{[R\\text{-}BL]}$$\nHere, $[R]$, $[BL]$, and $[R\\text{-}BL]$ represent the molar concentrations of the free receptor, free brassinolide, and the receptor-brassinolide complex at equilibrium, respectively.\n\nSimilarly, the equilibrium for the binding of castasterone is:\n$$R + CS \\rightleftharpoons R\\text{-}CS$$\nThe corresponding equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_{d,CS}$, is:\n$$K_{d,CS} = \\frac{[R][CS]}{[R\\text{-}CS]}$$\nwhere $[CS]$ is the concentration of free castasterone and $[R\\text{-}CS]$ is the concentration of the receptor-castasterone complex.\n\nThe objective is to find the ratio of BRI1 receptors occupied by BL to those occupied by CS, which is the ratio of the concentrations of the two complexes, $\\frac{[R\\text{-}BL]}{[R\\text{-}CS]}$.\n\nTo derive this ratio, we first rearrange the expressions for the dissociation constants to solve for the concentrations of the occupied receptor complexes.\nFor the BL-occupied receptor:\n$$[R\\text{-}BL] = \\frac{[R][BL]}{K_{d,BL}}$$\nFor the CS-occupied receptor:\n$$[R\\text{-}CS] = \\frac{[R][CS]}{K_{d,CS}}$$\n\nNow, we construct the desired ratio by dividing the expression for $[R\\text{-}BL]$ by the expression for $[R\\text{-}CS]$:\n$$\\frac{[R\\text{-}BL]}{[R\\text{-}CS]} = \\frac{\\frac{[R][BL]}{K_{d,BL}}}{\\frac{[R][CS]}{K_{d,CS}}}$$\n\nThe concentration of the free receptor, $[R]$, is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, and thus it cancels out. This simplification is crucial and is valid as long as $[R]$ is not zero, which must be true in any non-trivial equilibrium state.\n$$\\frac{[R\\text{-}BL]}{[R\\text{-}CS]} = \\frac{[BL]}{K_{d,BL}} \\cdot \\frac{K_{d,CS}}{[CS]}$$\nRearranging the terms gives the final symbolic expression for the ratio:\n$$\\frac{[R\\text{-}BL]}{[R\\text{-}CS]} = \\frac{[BL]}{[CS]} \\cdot \\frac{K_{d,CS}}{K_{d,BL}}$$\nThis expression demonstrates that the relative occupancy of the receptor by two competing ligands depends on the ratio of their concentrations and the inverse ratio of their affinities (where higher affinity corresponds to a lower $K_d$).\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into this derived expression. The problem states:\n$[\\mathrm{BL}] = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$[\\mathrm{CS}] = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$K_{d}^{\\mathrm{BRI1}}(\\mathrm{BL}) = K_{d,BL} = 1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$K_{d}^{\\mathrm{BRI1}}(\\mathrm{CS}) = K_{d,CS} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\nThe assumption that ligand depletion is negligible means we can use these total concentrations as the free ligand concentrations at equilibrium.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\\frac{[R\\text{-}BL]}{[R\\text{-}CS]} = \\frac{5\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{5\\,\\mathrm{nM}} \\cdot \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{1\\,\\mathrm{nM}}$$\nThe concentration units ($\\mathrm{nM}$) cancel out, yielding a dimensionless number, as required.\n$$\\frac{[R\\text{-}BL]}{[R\\text{-}CS]} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{10}{1} = 10$$\nThus, at equilibrium under the specified conditions, there are $10$ times more receptors occupied by brassinolide than by castasterone. This is expected, as brassinolide has a $10$-fold higher affinity for the receptor ($K_{d,BL}$ is $10$ times smaller than $K_{d,CS}$), while both ligands are present at the same concentration.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{10}\n$$", "id": "2553019"}, {"introduction": "Once a hormone binds its receptor, the signal must be translated into a physiological action, such as cell growth.

BL is a steroid hormone perceived by the receptor kinase BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) and transduced via protein phosphorylation cascades to both rapid and transcriptional responses. FC is known to directly stabilize the active complex of the plasma membrane proton adenosine triphosphatase ($\\mathrm{H}^+$-ATPase) with 14-3-3 proteins, bypassing receptor signaling. Segments are excised and equilibrated in a buffered solution at pH $6.0$ under constant turgor.

It provides a clear experimental context and a set of fundamental principles upon which to base predictions. All necessary components—biological system, treatments, inhibitors, genetic mutants, and underlying mechanisms—are defined. The problem is therefore valid for rigorous analysis.\n\nThe analysis will proceed by deducing the expected outcomes for each condition based on the provided principles.\n\n**Fundamental Principles Summary:**\n1.  **Brassinolide (BL) Action:** BL binds to the receptor kinase BRI1. This initiates a signaling cascade resulting in:\n    a. **Rapid (non-genomic) responses:** Post-translational modification of existing proteins, such as the plasma membrane $\\mathrm{H}^+$-ATPase, leading to its activation. This occurs within minutes.\n    b. **Long-term (genomic) responses:** Changes in gene expression via transcription factors, regulating development over hours to days.\n2.  **Fusicoccin (FC) Action:** FC acts as a direct molecular glue, stabilizing the active complex between the plasma membrane $\\mathrm{H}^+$-ATPase and 14-3-3 proteins. This bypasses receptor-level signaling.\n3.  **Acid Growth Hypothesis:** Activation of the $\\mathrm{H}^+$-ATPase leads to proton ($\\mathrm{H}^+$) efflux, acidifying the apoplast (cell wall space). This lower pH activates wall-loosening enzymes, increasing wall extensibility and promoting cell elongation under turgor pressure.\n4.  **Inhibitor Actions:**\n    a. **Cycloheximide (CHX):** Inhibits cytosolic protein synthesis. It will block genomic responses but not rapid, non-genomic responses that rely on pre-existing proteins.\n    b. **Sodium Orthovanadate:** A specific inhibitor of P-type ATPases, including the plasma membrane $\\mathrm{H}^+$-ATPase.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A. In wild type, both BL and FC will cause a rapid apoplastic acidification and a measurable increase in elongation within $\\leq 15$ min that persist in the presence of CHX; however, only BL requires BRI1-dependent signaling for these rapid responses, whereas FC does not.**\n\n- **Analysis:**\n    - Both BL (via its rapid, non-genomic pathway) and FC (via direct stabilization) activate the $\\mathrm{H}^+$-ATPase. According to the acid growth hypothesis, this leads to rapid acidification and elongation, reasonably within 15 minutes.\n    - Since these rapid responses rely on the modification or stabilization of pre-existing protein complexes (the $\\mathrm{H}^+$-ATPase and its regulators), they do not require new protein synthesis. Therefore, they should be insensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX.\n    - BL's action is explicitly stated to originate from the BRI1 receptor. FC's action is defined as bypassing the receptor. Thus, BRI1 is required for the BL response but not the FC response.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The prediction aligns perfectly with all given principles.\n\n**B. Vanadate will abolish FC-induced acidification and growth and strongly reduce the rapid BL-induced acidification, indicating that both responses depend on the activity of the plasma membrane $\\mathrm{H}^+$-ATPase.**\n\n- **Analysis:**\n    - Both BL and FC are proposed to cause acidification by activating the plasma membrane $\\mathrm{H}^+$-ATPase.\n    - Vanadate is an inhibitor of this specific type of pump.\n    - Therefore, vanadate should block the activity of the pump regardless of how it was activated. This means it will inhibit the effects of both FC and BL. FC's effect will be abolished as it has no other target. BL's rapid effect, being mediated by the pump, will be strongly reduced or abolished.\n    - The conclusion that both responses depend on the $\\mathrm{H}^+$-ATPase is the correct inference from this predicted result.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. This prediction correctly tests the convergence point of the two pathways using a specific inhibitor.\n\n**C. In the *bri1* mutant, FC will fail to stimulate elongation but BL will still promote rapid acidification via a non-genomic route, demonstrating that BRI1 is dispensable for BL’s early effects.**\n\n- **Analysis:**\n    - A *bri1* loss-of-function mutant lacks the receptor for BL. Therefore, BL will be unable to trigger its signaling cascade, and no acidification or growth should occur. The statement that BL will still promote acidification is false.\n    - FC bypasses the receptor and acts directly on the $\\mathrm{H}^+$-ATPase. Therefore, FC *should* stimulate elongation in the *bri1* mutant, as the downstream machinery is intact. The statement that FC will fail is false.\n    - The entire premise is flawed, and the concluding demonstration is consequently invalid.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect. The predictions for both FC and BL in the *bri1* mutant are the opposite of what the provided principles dictate.\n\n**D. FC and BL both converge on the activation state of the $\\mathrm{H}^+$-ATPase, but BL requires prior transcriptional upregulation of $\\mathrm{H}^+$-ATPase genes before any pump activation can occur, whereas FC stabilizes the phosphorylated $\\mathrm{H}^+$-ATPase–14-3-3 complex regardless of upstream kinase activity.**\n\n- **Analysis:**\n    - The statement incorrectly asserts that BL's action on the pump *requires* prior transcriptional upregulation. The problem explicitly states that hormone signaling involves *rapid* responses via modification of *pre-existing proteins* (non-genomic) as well as slower transcriptional responses. The rapid acidification observed within minutes cannot be due to transcription and translation, which is a much slower process. BL activates pre-existing pumps.\n    - The first part of the statement (\"FC and BL both converge on...\") is correct, but the reason given for BL's action is fundamentally wrong in the context of a rapid response.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect. This option misrepresents the mechanism of rapid hormone action, conflating it with the long-term genomic response.\n\n**E. Even if FC and BL are matched for the magnitude of rapid apoplastic acidification, only BL is expected to reorient cortical microtubules and alter cellulose synthase trajectories over hours via signaling to transcription factors (for example, BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1/BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1), resulting in divergent longer-term growth patterns that FC does not reproduce.**\n\n- **Analysis:**\n    - This option correctly distinguishes between the immediate effect (acid growth) and the complex, long-term developmental effects of a hormone.\n    - BL, as a steroid hormone, regulates a wide array of developmental processes, including the organization of the cytoskeleton and cell wall synthesis machinery. These effects are part of its long-term, genomic program, mediated by transcription factors like BZR1/BES1, as stated in the \"Hormone signaling logic\".\n    - FC is a toxin with a highly specific mode of action: direct activation of the $\\mathrm{H}^+$-ATPase. It does not engage the complex upstream signaling network of BL and is therefore not expected to reproduce the full suite of long-term developmental changes.\n    - This prediction accurately captures the difference between a specific effector (FC) and a pleiotropic signaling molecule (BL).\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The statement accurately describes the expected divergence in long-term effects based on the distinct mechanisms of action.\n\n**F. Auxin co-treatment will synergize with BL but antagonize FC on acidification because both converge on protein phosphatase 2C of clade D (PP2C-D) and therefore compete for the same phosphatase pool, reducing FC efficacy in the presence of auxin.**\n\n- **Analysis:**\n    - The problem statement and its fundamental bases provide no information whatsoever about \"auxin\" or \"protein phosphatase 2C of clade D (PP2C-D)\".\n    - The solution must be derived strictly from the information given. This option introduces external facts and molecules that are not part of the defined problem.\n    - While the statement may be factually correct in a broader biological context, it is not a valid prediction within the closed system of this problem.

The glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-like kinase BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 2 (BIN2) phosphorylates and inhibits BZR1/BES1, thereby antagonizing BR signaling. Bikinin is a small-molecule inhibitor of GSK3-like kinases that inhibits BIN2, thereby increasing BR signaling output downstream of BRI1. BR biosynthetic genes such as *DWF4* and *CPD* are classically regulated by negative feedback, meaning their transcription is downregulated when BR signaling output is high and upregulated when BR signaling is low. BR catabolic genes such as *PHYB ACTIVATION TAGGED SUPPRESSOR 1* (*BAS1*) are typically upregulated by BR signaling.\n\nYou perform a time-course experiment on etiolated seedlings. At time $t=0$ you add bikinin at a constant concentration and maintain it until $t=6$ h, then wash it out and continue sampling up to $t=24$ h. You measure mRNA abundance of *DWF4* and *CPD* by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), normalized to their respective levels at $t=0$. Assume the following foundational principles and approximations, without assuming any specific parameter values: \n- Transcriptional output of a feedback-repressed biosynthetic gene is a monotonic decreasing function of instantaneous BR signaling output $S(t)$, denoted $r_{\\text{tx}}(t)=k_{\\text{tx}}\\,f(S(t))$ with $f'(S)<0$ and $0<f(S)\\leq 1$.\n- Messenger RNA (mRNA) kinetics are well described by first-order production and degradation, $\\frac{dx}{dt} = r_{\\text{tx}}(t)-\\gamma x(t)$, where $x(t)$ is the mRNA abundance and $\\gamma>0$ is the first-order decay constant.\n- Endogenous bioactive BR pool $B(t)$ is synthesized at a rate proportional to biosynthetic pathway output and removed by catabolism and dilution, $\\frac{dB}{dt} = k_{\\text{syn}}\\,u(t)-k_{\\text{loss}}\\,B(t)$, where $u(t)$ is a coarse-grained measure of pathway enzyme capacity that correlates positively with biosynthetic gene expression, and $k_{\\text{syn}},k_{\\text{loss}}>0$.\n- BR signaling output $S(t)$ is a monotonic increasing function of $B(t)$ in the absence of kinase inhibition.

After washout at $t=6$ h, they rebound above their pretreatment baseline (an overshoot) before relaxing back to baseline as endogenous BR pools recover. This occurs because bikinin clamps $S(t)$ high, causing strong feedback repression and progressive depletion of $B(t)$; once the clamp is removed, $B(t)$ is low, so $S(t)$ is initially low, transiently disinhibiting transcription until $B(t)$ and $S(t)$ re-equilibrate. BR catabolic targets (e.g., *BAS1*) increase during bikinin exposure.\n\nB. *DWF4*/*CPD* mRNAs increase immediately after bikinin addition because the system compensates for elevated signaling by producing more hormone; after washout, they undershoot below baseline because signaling falls, exemplifying overcompensation. Catabolic targets decrease during bikinin exposure.\n\nC. *DWF4*/*CPD* mRNAs show little to no change with bikinin because feedback senses hormone concentration rather than signaling state; only exogenous hormone would downregulate biosynthesis genes, so no overcompensation is expected upon washout.\n\nD. *DWF4*/*CPD* mRNAs transiently increase during bikinin exposure due to rapid consumption of BR by the activated pathway, then decrease slowly; after washout they remain unchanged because the feedback is saturated and cannot overshoot.

Its application increases BR signaling output downstream of BRI1.\n-   **Gene Regulation**:\n    -   **Negative Feedback**: BR biosynthetic genes, including *DWF4* and *CPD*, are transcriptionally downregulated by high BR signaling and upregulated by low BR signaling.\n    -   **Positive Regulation**: BR catabolic genes, such as *BAS1*, are transcriptionally upregulated by BR signaling.\n-   **Experimental Protocol**:\n    -   Time $t=0$: Bikinin is added to etiolated seedlings.\n    -   Time interval $0 \\leq t \\leq 6$ h: Culture is maintained in a constant concentration of bikinin.\n    -   Time $t=6$ h: Bikinin is washed out.\n    -   Time interval $6$ h $< t \\leq 24$ h: Seedlings are monitored post-washout.\n-   **Approximations and Principles**:\n    1.  **Transcription Rate**: The transcription rate of a feedback-repressed gene is $r_{\\text{tx}}(t)=k_{\\text{tx}}\\,f(S(t))$, where $S(t)$ is the instantaneous BR signaling output, $k_{\\text{tx}}$ is a constant, and $f(S)$ is a monotonic decreasing function ($f'(S)<0$) with $0<f(S)\\leq 1$.\n    2.  **mRNA Kinetics**: mRNA abundance $x(t)$ follows the first-order differential equation $\\frac{dx}{dt} = r_{\\text{tx}}(t)-\\gamma x(t)$, where $\\gamma>0$ is the mRNA decay rate constant.\n    3.  **BR Hormone Pool**: The endogenous bioactive BR level $B(t)$ follows $\\frac{dB}{dt} = k_{\\text{syn}}\\,u(t)-k_{\\text{loss}}\\,B(t)$, where $u(t)$ represents biosynthetic pathway capacity (positively correlated with biosynthetic gene expression), and $k_{\\text{syn}}, k_{\\text{loss}} > 0$.\n    4.  **Signaling Output**: In the absence of the inhibitor, $S(t)$ is a monotonic increasing function of $B(t)$. When bikinin is present, $S(t)$ is clamped at a high value $S_{\\text{hi}}$ independent of $B(t)$. After washout, $S(t)$ is again dependent on $B(t)$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in established molecular and systems biology of plant hormone signaling.

These allow for a unique qualitative prediction of the system's behavior.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem statement is objective, using precise, technical language and avoiding any subjective or ambiguous terminology. The simplifying assumptions are explicitly stated.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed invalidity flaws. It is a classic systems biology problem that tests the understanding of feedback loops with delays.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nI will analyze the system's dynamics in two phases, corresponding to the experimental protocol. Let $x(t)$ be the mRNA abundance of *DWF4*/*CPD*, $B(t)$ be the endogenous BR concentration, and $S(t)$ be the signaling output. The initial state at $t=0$ is a steady state, denoted by $x_0$, $B_0$, and $S_0$.\n\n**Phase 1: Bikinin Treatment ($0 \\leq t \\leq 6$ h)**\n\n1.  At $t=0$, bikinin is added. According to principle 4, this inhibits the negative regulator BIN2, causing the signaling output $S(t)$ to be immediately clamped at a high value, $S(t) = S_{\\text{hi}}$, where $S_{\\text{hi}} > S_0$.\n2.  The transcription rate of *DWF4*/*CPD* is given by $r_{\\text{tx}}(t) = k_{\\text{tx}}\\,f(S(t))$. Since $S(t)$ is high ($S_{\\text{hi}}$) and $f(S)$ is a decreasing function, the transcription rate drops to a new low value, $r_{\\text{tx,low}} = k_{\\text{tx}}\\,f(S_{\\text{hi}})$. This is a strong negative feedback response.\n3.  The mRNA level $x(t)$ is governed by $\\frac{dx}{dt} = r_{\\text{tx}}(t) - \\gamma x(t)$. At $t=0^+$, the production rate $r_{\\text{tx}}$ has dropped, while the degradation term $-\\gamma x(0)$ is still high. Thus, $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ becomes negative, and $x(t)$ begins to decrease from its initial value $x_0$ towards a new, lower steady state. The rapid drop within $1$–$2$ hours reflects a typical mRNA half-life ($t_{1/2} = \\ln(2)/\\gamma$).\n4.  The endogenous BR pool $B(t)$ is governed by $\\frac{dB}{dt} = k_{\\text{syn}}\\,u(t)-k_{\\text{loss}}\\,B(t)$. The term $u(t)$ represents enzyme capacity, which is positively correlated with the gene expression level $x(t)$. As $x(t)$ decreases, so does $u(t)$, leading to a decrease in the BR synthesis rate $k_{\\text{syn}}\\,u(t)$. This reduction in synthesis, combined with ongoing catabolism and dilution (the $k_{\\text{loss}}\\,B(t)$ term), causes the endogenous BR pool $B(t)$ to be progressively depleted.\n5.  Furthermore, the problem states that BR catabolic genes (*BAS1*) are upregulated by BR signaling. Since $S(t)=S_{\\text{hi}}$ is high throughout this phase, the expression of *BAS1* will increase, potentially increasing the rate of BR degradation and further contributing to the depletion of the $B(t)$ pool.\n6.  By the end of this phase at $t=6$ h, the system is in a state where signaling is high ($S_{\\text{hi}}$), biosynthetic gene expression is low ($x(6) \\ll x_0$), and the endogenous hormone pool is depleted ($B(6) < B_0$).\n\n**Phase 2: Post-Washout ($t > 6$ h)**\n\n1.  At $t=6$ h, bikinin is removed. According to principle 4, the signaling output $S(t)$ is no longer clamped by the inhibitor and reverts to being a function of the BR concentration $B(t)$.\n2.  At the moment of washout, the BR pool is at a low level, $B(6) < B_0$. Since $S(t)$ is an increasing function of $B(t)$, the signaling output will plummet from $S_{\\text{hi}}$ to a very low value, $S(6^+) = S(B(6)) \\ll S_0$.\n3.  This extremely low signaling level $S(t)$ has a dramatic effect on transcription. The transcription rate $r_{\\text{tx}}(t)=k_{\\text{tx}}\\,f(S(t))$ will jump to a very high level, because $f(S)$ is a decreasing function. Thus, $r_{\\text{tx}}(6^+) \\gg r_{\\text{tx}}(0)$. This is a strong release of feedback repression, or \"disinhibition\".\n4.  The mRNA level $x(t)$ dynamic is $\\frac{dx}{dt} = r_{\\text{tx}}(t) - \\gamma x(t)$. At $t=6$ h, $x(6)$ is low, while the transcription rate $r_{\\text{tx}}$ has just become very high. Consequently, $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ becomes strongly positive, and $x(t)$ begins to increase rapidly.\n5.  Because the transcription rate is now significantly higher than the original steady-state rate, the mRNA level $x(t)$ will not simply return to baseline $x_0$; it will **overshoot** this level. This phenomenon is termed overcompensation.\n6.  As $x(t)$ increases and overshoots, the biosynthetic capacity $u(t)$ also increases, accelerating the replenishment of the BR pool $B(t)$. As $B(t)$ rises, so does the signaling output $S(t)$. This re-establishes the negative feedback, causing $r_{\\text{tx}}(t)$ to decrease. The system will then relax, likely through damped oscillations, back to the original steady state ($x_0, B_0, S_0$).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. *DWF4*/*CPD* mRNAs drop rapidly after bikinin addition (within about $1$–$2$ h) and remain suppressed while bikinin is present. After washout at $t=6$ h, they rebound above their pretreatment baseline (an overshoot) before relaxing back to baseline as endogenous BR pools recover. This occurs because bikinin clamps $S(t)$ high, causing strong feedback repression and progressive depletion of $B(t)$; once the clamp is removed, $B(t)$ is low, so $S(t)$ is initially low, transiently disinhibiting transcription until $B(t)$ and $S(t)$ re-equilibrate. BR catabolic targets (e.g., *BAS1*) increase during bikinin exposure.**\n-   This option correctly describes the suppression of *DWF4*/*CPD* mRNA during bikinin treatment.\n-   It correctly predicts the rebound and overshoot after washout.\n-   It provides a mechanistically precise explanation for the overshoot: the depletion of the hormone pool $B(t)$ during treatment leads to a state of very low signaling upon inhibitor removal, which causes a transient, strong induction of transcription.\n-   It correctly predicts that catabolic gene expression increases during treatment due to high signaling.\nThis matches my derivation in every detail.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. *DWF4*/*CPD* mRNAs increase immediately after bikinin addition because the system compensates for elevated signaling by producing more hormone; after washout, they undershoot below baseline because signaling falls, exemplifying overcompensation. Catabolic targets decrease during bikinin exposure.**\n-   The initial increase in mRNA is incorrect. This statement misinterprets negative feedback as positive feedback.\n-   The prediction of an undershoot is incorrect. The dynamics lead to an overshoot.\n-   The prediction of decreased catabolic gene expression is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. *DWF4*/*CPD* mRNAs show little to no change with bikinin because feedback senses hormone concentration rather than signaling state; only exogenous hormone would downregulate biosynthesis genes, so no overcompensation is expected upon washout.**\n-   The assertion that feedback senses hormone concentration $B(t)$ directly contradicts principle 1, which states transcription depends on signaling output $S(t)$. The premise of \"little to no change\" is therefore flawed.\n-   Because of the initial flaw, the conclusion of \"no overcompensation\" is also incorrect. The dynamics described in the problem explicitly lead to overcompensation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. *DWF4*/*CPD* mRNAs transiently increase during bikinin exposure due to rapid consumption of BR by the activated pathway, then decrease slowly; after washout they remain unchanged because the feedback is saturated and cannot overshoot. Catabolic targets are unchanged by bikinin.**\n-   The transient increase is incorrect. Signaling increases, so transcription of biosynthetic genes must decrease due to negative feedback.\n-   The prediction of no change after washout is incorrect. The system is far from equilibrium and will exhibit strong dynamics to return. The claim of saturation preventing an overshoot is an unsubstantiated assertion that contradicts the expected behavior of such a feedback system.\n-   The prediction that catabolic targets are unchanged is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nConclusion: Option A provides the only accurate and mechanistically sound description of the system's behavior based on the provided principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2553075"}]}
