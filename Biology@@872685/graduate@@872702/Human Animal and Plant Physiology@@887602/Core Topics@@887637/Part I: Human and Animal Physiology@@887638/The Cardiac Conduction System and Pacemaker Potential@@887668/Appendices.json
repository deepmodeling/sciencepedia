With this approximation, the differential equation becomes:\n$$C_m \\frac{dV}{dt} \\approx I_{\\mathrm{eff}}$$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients, which can be solved by separation of variables. We rearrange the equation to separate the variables $V$ and $t$:\n$$dt = \\frac{C_m}{I_{\\mathrm{eff}}} dV$$\nTo find the total time $T$ required for the voltage to change from the maximum diastolic potential $V_{\\mathrm{MDP}}$ to the threshold potential $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$, we integrate both sides of the equation over the corresponding intervals. Time $t$ runs from $0$ to $T$, and voltage $V$ runs from $V_{\\mathrm{MDP}}$ to $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{T} dt = \\int_{V_{\\mathrm{MDP}}}^{V_{\\mathrm{th}}} \\frac{C_m}{I_{\\mathrm{eff}}} dV$$\nSince $C_m$ and the effective current $I_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ are constants with respect to the variable of integration $V$, they can be taken outside the integral:\n$$[t]_{0}^{T} = \\frac{C_m}{I_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\int_{V_{\\mathrm{MDP}}}^{V_{\\mathrm{th}}} dV$$\n$$T - 0 = \\frac{C_m}{I_{\\mathrm{eff}}} [V]_{V_{\\mathrm{MDP}}}^{V_{\\mathrm{th}}}$$\n$$T = \\frac{C_m}{I_{\\mathrm{eff}}} (V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_{\\mathrm{MDP}})$$\nAs specified, we define the voltage increment as $\\Delta V = V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_{\\mathrm{MDP}}$.
