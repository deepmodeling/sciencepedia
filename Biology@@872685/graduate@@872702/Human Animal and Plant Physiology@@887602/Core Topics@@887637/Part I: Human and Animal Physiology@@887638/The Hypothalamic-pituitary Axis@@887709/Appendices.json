The language is objective and precise, and the parameter values are physiologically plausible. No logical contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness are present. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is a two-step process. First, we compute the concentration of free cortisol, $F$, from the equilibrium with CBG.

Phases of sinusoidal components are in radians and may be arbitrary.\n- Preprocessing: Remove the mean and apply a smooth symmetric taper window to reduce spectral leakage (for example, a Hann window).\n- Spectral estimation: Compute the power spectrum using a Discrete Fourier Transform-based approach.

This is a problem in physiological signal processing. The fundamental premise is that the pituitary gland acts as a linear time-invariant (LTI) system, which implies that the frequency content of the input signal (pulsatile GnRH) is preserved in the output signal (pulsatile LH). Therefore, the dominant frequency of LH pulsatility corresponds to the GnRH pulse frequency.\n\nThe solution is a multi-step procedure involving time series synthesis, signal preprocessing, spectral analysis, and application of a specific detection algorithm.\n\n**1. Model and Time Series Synthesis**\n\nThe LH time series is modeled as a discrete signal $y[k]$ sampled from a continuous signal $L(t)$. The continuous signal is a superposition of one or two sinusoidal components representing physiological pulses, an optional low-frequency drift component, and additive white Gaussian noise $\\epsilon(t)$. The model is given by:\n$$L(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{comp}} A_i \\sin(2\\pi f_i t + \\phi_i) + A_d \\sin(2\\pi f_d t + \\phi_d) + \\epsilon(t)$$\nwhere $A_i$ and $f_i$ are the amplitude and frequency of the $i$-th pulse component, $A_d$ and $f_d$ are the amplitude and frequency of the drift, $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_d$ are arbitrary phases (which we can set to $0$ without loss of generality for power spectrum analysis), and $\\epsilon(t)$ is a noise process with $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$.\n\nThe time series $y[k]$ is generated by sampling $L(t)$ at uniform intervals $\\Delta t$ over a total duration $T$. The discrete time points are $t_k = k \\Delta t$ for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1$. The number of samples $N$ is determined by $N = \\text{floor}(T / \\Delta t)$.\n\n**2. Sampling Theory and Frequency Resolution**\n\nAccording to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, a continuous signal can be perfectly reconstructed from its samples if the sampling frequency $f_s = 1/\\Delta t$ is greater than twice the maximum frequency present in the signal. The Nyquist frequency, $f_N = f_s/2 = 1/(2\\Delta t)$, represents the highest frequency that can be unambiguously resolved from the sampled data.\n\nThe problem imposes a sampling constraint based on the physiological band of interest, which is $[0.2, 2.0]$ pulses per hour. The constraint is that if $0.9 f_N \\le 0.2$, the sampling rate is considered too low for reliable detection within the band. In such a case, the analysis is terminated, and the result is declared as impossible to determine.\n\nThe Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is used to transform the time-domain signal into the frequency domain. For a signal of length $N$ with sampling interval $\\Delta t$, the DFT produces $N$ complex coefficients corresponding to frequencies $f_m = m \\cdot \\frac{f_s}{N} = \\frac{m}{N \\Delta t}$ for $m = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1$. The frequency resolution of the spectrum is $\\Delta f = f_s/N = 1/(N \\Delta t)$.\n\n**3. Signal Preprocessing**\n\nBefore spectral analysis, two preprocessing steps are essential:\n- **Mean Removal**: The sample mean $\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} y[k]$ is subtracted from the signal. This removes the DC component ($f=0$) of the spectrum, which is often large and can obscure nearby low-frequency physiological signals.\n- **Windowing**: The mean-subtracted signal is multiplied by a window function. A Hann window is specified as an example. The formula for a Hann window $w[k]$ of length $N$ is:\n$$w[k] = 0.5 \\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{N-1}\\right)\\right), \\quad k = 0, \\dots, N-1$$\nWindowing tapers the signal towards zero at its ends, which significantly reduces spectral leakage. Spectral leakage is the phenomenon where the energy from a finite-duration signal's true frequency spreads out to adjacent frequency bins in the DFT, potentially creating spurious peaks or masking weaker signals.\n\n**4. Power Spectrum Estimation**\n\nThe power spectrum is computed from the DFT of the preprocessed signal. Let $Y[m]$ be the DFT of the windowed, mean-centered signal.\n$$Y[m] = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} (y[k] - \\bar{y}) w[k] e^{-j2\\pi mk/N}$$\nThe power at each frequency bin $f_m$ is proportional to the squared magnitude of the DFT coefficient, $P[m] \\propto |Y[m]|^2$. Since the input signal is real, the power spectrum is symmetric, and we only need to analyze the one-sided spectrum for positive frequencies, i.e., for $m = 0, \\dots, \\lfloor N/2 \\rfloor$.\n\n**5. Dominant Frequency Detection Algorithm**\n\nThe core of the inference lies in a rule-based detection algorithm applied to the computed power spectrum.\n- **Physiological Band Search**: The search for the dominant frequency is restricted to the prespecified physiological range of $[0.2, 2.0]$ pulses per hour. This constraint is based on established biological knowledge of LH pulse frequency.\n- **Peak Identification**: Within this band, the frequency $f_{peak}$ corresponding to the maximum power value $P_{peak}$ is identified as the candidate dominant frequency.\n- **Detection Criteria**: The candidate frequency $f_{peak}$ is accepted as a valid physiological pulse frequency only if two conditions are met simultaneously:\n    1.  **Peak Prominence**: The ratio of the peak power to the median power of all spectral estimates within the physiological band must be at least $6.0$.\n    $$ \\frac{P_{peak}}{P_{median}} \\ge 6.0 $$\n    This criterion ensures that the identified peak is statistically significant and stands out sufficiently from the background noise spectrum within the band.\n    2.  **Sufficient Observation**: The total duration of the data record, $T$, must be long enough to contain at least $3$ full cycles of the candidate frequency.\n    $$ T \\cdot f_{peak} \\ge 3.0 $$\n    This condition ensures that the oscillation is not a transient artifact and has been observed long enough to be considered a persistent feature of the signal.\n\nIf both conditions are satisfied, $f_{peak}$ is accepted as the inferred LH pulse frequency. By the LTI assumption, this is also the inferred GnRH pulse generator frequency. If either condition fails, or if the initial sampling constraint is violated, or if no spectral data falls within the physiological band, no reliable pulse frequency can be determined, and the result is denoted as $-1.0$.\n\nThis entire procedure is implemented and applied to each test case to derive the final results.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{[\\text{1.000, 0.625, -1.000, 0.500}]}$$", "id": "2617406"}]}
