We shall approach this systematically, beginning with fundamental chemical principles.\n\nThe central reaction governing the carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffer system in blood plasma is the dissociation of carbonic acid ($\\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3$). In reality, this is a two-step process involving the hydration of dissolved carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) and the subsequent dissociation of the resulting carbonic acid:\n$$CO_2(\\text{aq}) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(\\text{l}) \\rightleftharpoons \\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3(\\text{aq}) \\rightleftharpoons H^+(\\text{aq}) + \\text{HCO}_3^-(\\text{aq})$$\nIn physiological and clinical contexts, the concentration of carbonic acid ($[\\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3]$) is very low compared to the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide ($[CO_2(\\text{aq})]$). It is therefore standard practice to combine these steps and use an apparent acid dissociation constant, $K_{a}$, that directly relates the concentration of hydrogen ions $[H^{+}]$ and bicarbonate ions $[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$ to the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide $[CO_2(\\text{aq})]$.\n\nThe law of mass action applied to this combined equilibrium is given by:\n$$K_{a} = \\frac{[H^+][\\text{HCO}_3^-]}{[CO_2(\\text{aq})]}$$\n\nThe concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide in plasma, $[CO_2(\\text{aq})]$, is governed by Henry's law, which states that it is directly proportional to the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the gas phase, in this case, the arterial partial pressure, $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$. The constant of proportionality is the solubility coefficient, $\\alpha_{\\text{CO}_2}$.\n$$[CO_2(\\text{aq})] = \\alpha_{\\text{CO}_2} P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$$\n\nWe substitute the expression from Henry's law into the mass action equation:\n$$K_{a} = \\frac{[H^+][\\text{HCO}_3^-]}{\\alpha_{\\text{CO}_2} P_{a\\text{CO}_2}}$$\n\nTo derive an expression for the pH, we first solve for the hydrogen ion concentration, $[H^{+}]$:\n$$[H^{+}] = K_{a} \\frac{\\alpha_{\\text{CO}_2} P_{a\\text{CO}_2}}{[\\text{HCO}_3^-]}$$\n\nThe pH is defined as the negative base-10 logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration: $\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}([H^{+}])$. Applying this definition to our expression for $[H^{+}]$:\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}\\left(K_{a} \\frac{\\alpha_{\\text{CO}_2} P_{a\\text{CO}_2}}{[\\text{HCO}_3^-]}\\right)$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\log(ab) = \\log(a) + \\log(b)$ and $\\log(a/b) = -\\log(b/a)$, we expand this expression:\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}(K_{a}) - \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{\\text{CO}_2} P_{a\\text{CO}_2}}{[\\text{HCO}_3^-]}\\right)$$\nBy definition, $pK_{a} = -\\log_{10}(K_{a})$. Applying this and inverting the argument of the second logarithm yields the final expression for pH, which is the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = pK_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\text{HCO}_3^-]}{\\alpha_{\\text{CO}_2} P_{a\\text{CO}_2}}\\right)$$\nThis is the required expression for pH in terms of the given parameters.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for pH using the provided data: $[\\text{HCO}_3^-] = 18 \\text{ mmol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$, $P_{a\\text{CO}_2} = 60 \\text{ mmHg}$, $pK_{a} = 6.1$, and $\\alpha_{\\text{CO}_2} = 0.030 \\text{ mmol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{mmHg}^{-1}$.\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of dissolved $CO_2$:\n$$[CO_2(\\text{aq})] = \\alpha_{\\text{CO}_2} P_{a\\text{CO}_2} = (0.030 \\text{ mmol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{mmHg}^{-1}) \\times (60 \\text{ mmHg}) = 1.8 \\text{ mmol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$$\nNow, we substitute this and the other values into the derived pH equation:\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = 6.1 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{18 \\text{ mmol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}}{1.8 \\text{ mmol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}}\\right)$$\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = 6.1 + \\log_{10}(10)$$\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = 6.1 + 1 = 7.1$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.100$.\n\nFinally, we classify the acid-base disturbance. To do this from first principles, we must compare the patient's values to normal physiological values and analyze the direction of the deviations.\nNormal resting values are approximately: $\\mathrm{pH} \\approx 7.40$, $P_{a\\text{CO}_2} \\approx 40 \\text{ mmHg}$, and $[\\text{HCO}_3^-] \\approx 24 \\text{ mmol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$.\nThe patient's values are: $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.100$, $P_{a\\text{CO}_2} = 60 \\text{ mmHg}$, and $[\\text{HCO}_3^-] = 18 \\text{ mmol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$.\n\nThe patient's pH is significantly below normal, indicating a state of acidosis. An acidosis can be caused by either a respiratory disturbance (elevated $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$) or a metabolic disturbance (depressed $[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$), or both.\n1. The patient's $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$ is $60 \\text{ mmHg}$, which is substantially higher than the normal value of $40 \\text{ mmHg}$. An elevated $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$ (hypercapnia) drives the equilibrium $CO_2 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + \\text{HCO}_3^-$ to the right, increasing $[H^+]$ and thus causing acidosis. This component is consistent with a primary respiratory acidosis.\n2. The patient's $[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$ is $18 \\text{ mmol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$, which is substantially lower than the normal value of $24 \\text{ mmol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$. A decreased $[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$ also shifts the equilibrium to the right to replenish bicarbonate, which increases $[H^+]$ and causes acidosis. This component is consistent with a primary metabolic acidosis.\n\nNow, let us consider the possibility of physiological compensation.\n- If the primary disturbance were a simple respiratory acidosis ($P_{a\\text{CO}_2} \\uparrow$), the compensatory response by the kidneys would be to retain bicarbonate, leading to an *increase* in $[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$. The patient's $[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$ is low, not high. This contradicts the expected compensatory pattern.\n- If the primary disturbance were a simple metabolic acidosis ($[\\text{HCO}_3^-] \\downarrow$), the compensatory response by the lungs would be to increase ventilation (hyperventilation) to eliminate $CO_2$, leading to a *decrease* in $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$. The patient's $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$ is high, not low. This also contradicts the expected compensatory pattern.\n\nSince both the respiratory component ($P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$) and the metabolic component ($[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$) have moved from their normal setpoints in directions that independently cause acidosis, and neither change can be explained as a compensation for the other, the only logical conclusion is that two separate primary pathological processes are occurring simultaneously. The state is therefore a mixed primary disturbance, specifically a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis. The patient is hypoventilating (or has impaired gas exchange) and simultaneously has a primary base deficit (or acid gain).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{7.100}\n$$", "id": "2554407"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the plasma bicarbonate buffer, hemoglobin is the key player that dramatically augments the blood's capacity to transport carbon dioxide.
