Due to linearity, the parameter values at $L_m$ are the averages of their values at $L_1$ and $L_2$:\n$$\nn_H(L_m) = \\frac{n_H(L_1) + n_H(L_2)}{2} = \\frac{4 + 5}{2} = 4.5\n$$\n$$\npCa_{50}(L_m) = \\frac{pCa_{50}(L_1) + pCa_{50}(L_2)}{2} = \\frac{5.80 + 6.00}{2} = 5.90\n$$\nWe observe that at this midpoint length, $pCa_{50}(L_m)$ is equal to the specified systolic calcium level, $pCa_{\\mathrm{sys}} = 5.90$. The force at this operating point is:\n$$\nF(pCa_{\\mathrm{sys}}; L_m) = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{n_H(L_m)(pCa_{\\mathrm{sys}} - pCa_{50}(L_m))}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{4.5(5.90 - 5.90)}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^0} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nTo find the slope $S(L) = \\frac{dF}{dL}$, we differentiate $F$ with respect to $L$ using the chain rule. Let $X(L) = n_H(L)(pCa - pCa_{50}(L))$.\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dL} = \\frac{d}{dL} \\left(1 + 10^{X(L)}\\right)^{-1} = -1 \\cdot \\left(1 + 10^{X(L)}\\right)^{-2} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dL}\\left(10^{X(L)}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dL} = -\\left(1 + 10^{X(L)}\\right)^{-2} \\cdot \\ln(10) \\cdot 10^{X(L)} \\cdot \\frac{dX}{dL}\n$$\nRecognizing that $F = (1+10^X)^{-1}$ and $1-F = 10^X(1+10^X)^{-1}$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dL} = - \\ln(10) \\cdot F(1-F) \\cdot \\frac{dX}{dL}\n$$\nNow we find $\\frac{dX}{dL}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dX}{dL} = \\frac{d}{dL} \\left[ n_H(L)(pCa - pCa_{50}(L)) \\right] = pCa \\frac{dn_H}{dL} - \\frac{d}{dL} \\left[ n_H(L) pCa_{50}(L) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the product rule for the second term:\n$$\n\\frac{dX}{dL} = pCa \\frac{dn_H}{dL} - \\left( \\frac{dn_H}{dL} pCa_{50}(L) + n_H(L) \\frac{dpCa_{50}}{dL} \\right) = \\frac{dn_H}{dL} \\left( pCa - pCa_{50}(L) \\right) - n_H(L) \\frac{dpCa_{50}}{dL}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\frac{dF}{dL}$:\n$$\nS(L) = \\frac{dF}{dL} = -\\ln(10) F(1-F) \\left[ \\frac{dn_H}{dL} \\left( pCa - pCa_{50}(L) \\right) - n_H(L) \\frac{dpCa_{50}}{dL} \\right]\n$$\nWe evaluate this expression at $L=L_m$ and $pCa=pCa_{\\mathrm{sys}}$. At this point, $pCa_{\\mathrm{sys}} - pCa_{50}(L_m) = 0$. The expression for the slope simplifies dramatically:\n$$\nS(L_m) = -\\ln(10) F(1-F) \\left[ 0 - n_H(L_m) \\frac{dpCa_{50}}{dL} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nS(L_m) = \\ln(10) \\cdot F(1-F) \\cdot n_H(L_m) \\cdot \\frac{dpCa_{50}}{dL}\n$$\nNow we substitute the calculated values: $F = \\frac{1}{2}$, $n_H(L_m) = 4.5 = \\frac{9}{2}$, and $\\frac{dpCa_{50}}{dL} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n$$\nF(1-F) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n$$\nS(L_m) = \\ln(10) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\ln(10) \\cdot \\frac{1 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 2}{4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} = \\ln(10) \\cdot \\frac{18}{24} = \\frac{3}{4}\\ln(10)\n$$\nThe problem requires a numerical value for $S$ in $\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nS(L_m) = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 2.302585... \\approx 1.7269388...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $1.727$.
