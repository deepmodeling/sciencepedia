The renal handling of glucose is governed by the equation:\nExcretion Rate = Filtration Rate - Reabsorption Rate.\nOr, in terms of clearance, $C_{\\text{glucose}} = \\frac{(GFR \\cdot P_{\\text{glucose}}) - T_{reabs, \\text{glucose}}}{P_{\\text{glucose}}}$, where $T_{reabs, \\text{glucose}}$ is the tubular reabsorption rate of glucose.\nBy inhibiting reabsorption, $T_{reabs, \\text{glucose}}$ decreases. Since filtration rate ($GFR \\cdot P_{\\text{glucose}}$) is constant, a decrease in reabsorption causes an increase in the excretion rate ($U_{\\text{glucose}} \\cdot V$). Since $C_{\\text{glucose}} = (U_{\\text{glucose}} \\cdot V) / P_{\\text{glucose}}$ and $P_{\\text{glucose}}$ is constant, $C_{\\text{glucose}}$ must increase.\nThe problem states there is no glucose secretion. Therefore, the maximum possible clearance of glucose is achieved when reabsorption is zero, in which case $C_{\\text{glucose}} = GFR = C_{\\text{in}}$. This means the clearance ratio $C_{\\text{glucose}}/C_{\\text{in}}$ cannot exceed $1$.\nThus, after SGLT2 inhibition, $C_{\\text{glucose}}/C_{\\text{in}}$ **increases** from its very low baseline value but **remains less than $1$**.\n\n**Intervention 2: Probenecid Administration**\nProbenecid \"markedly reducing PAH secretion\". The renal handling of PAH, assuming no reabsorption as stated, is given by:\nExcretion Rate = Filtration Rate + Secretion Rate.\nIn terms of clearance, $C_{\\text{PAH}} = \\frac{(GFR \\cdot P_{\\text{PAH}}) + T_{sec, \\text{PAH}}}{P_{\\text{PAH}}}$, where $T_{sec, \\text{PAH}}$ is the tubular secretion rate of PAH.\nBy inhibiting secretion, $T_{sec, \\text{PAH}}$ decreases. Since filtration rate ($GFR \\cdot P_{\\text{PAH}}$) is constant, a decrease in secretion causes a decrease in the excretion rate ($U_{\\text{PAH}} \\cdot V$). This leads to a decrease in $C_{\\text{PAH}}$.\nThe minimum possible clearance for PAH occurs when secretion is completely blocked ($T_{sec, \\text{PAH}} = 0$). In this scenario, $C_{\\text{PAH}} = GFR = C_{\\text{in}}$. This means the clearance ratio $C_{\\text{PAH}}/C_{\\text{in}}$ would become $1$.\nSince probenecid \"markedly reduces\" secretion, the clearance ratio $C_{\\text{PAH}}/C_{\\text{in}}$ will **decrease** from its baseline value of $6.0$ **toward $1$**.\n\nThe interventions described have no specified effect on mannitol handling. Therefore, $C_{\\text{mannitol}}$ will remain equal to $C_{\\text{in}}$, and the ratio $C_{\\text{mannitol}}/C_{\\text{in}}$ will remain unchanged at $1$.\n\n### Step 3: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Baseline: glucose is net reabsorbed, PAH is net secreted, mannitol is neither reabsorbed nor secreted. After SGLT2 inhibition, $C_{\\text{glucose}}/C_{\\text{in}}$ increases but remains $1$; after probenecid, $C_{\\text{PAH}}/C_{\\text{in}}$ decreases toward $1$; $C_{\\text{mannitol}}/C_{\\text{in}}$ remains unchanged.**\n- Baseline assessment: **Correct**. Matches our calculations.\n- Glucose prediction: **Correct**. Inhibition of reabsorption increases clearance, which cannot exceed GFR without secretion.\n- PAH prediction: **Correct**. Inhibition of secretion reduces clearance toward the GFR.\n- Mannitol prediction: **Correct**. No mechanism for change is present.\nThe entirety of this option is consistent with our rigorous derivation.\n\n**B.

After SGLT2 inhibition, $C_{\\text{glucose}}/C_{\\text{in}}$ is unchanged; after probenecid, $C_{\\text{PAH}}/C_{\\text{in}}$ decreases to $1$ (net reabsorption), and $C_{\\text{mannitol}}/C_{\\text{in}}$ remains unchanged.**\n- Glucose prediction: **Incorrect**. Inhibiting reabsorption must increase clearance.\n- PAH prediction: **Incorrect**. PAH is not reabsorbed, so its clearance cannot fall below GFR; the ratio cannot be less than $1$.\n\n**C. Baseline: glucose is neither reabsorbed nor secreted, PAH is net reabsorbed, and mannitol is net secreted. After SGLT2 inhibition, $C_{\\text{glucose}}/C_{\\text{in}}$ becomes $1$; after probenecid, $C_{\\text{PAH}}/C_{\\text{in}}$ increases.**\n- Baseline assessment: **Incorrect**. This is in direct contradiction to our calculations.\n\n**D. Baseline: glucose is net reabsorbed, PAH is net secreted, mannitol is neither reabsorbed nor secreted. After SGLT2 inhibition, $C_{\\text{glucose}}/C_{\\text{in}}$ becomes $1$; after probenecid, $C_{\\text{PAH}}/C_{\\text{in}}$ is unchanged because filtration dominates.**\n- Glucose prediction: **Incorrect**. Without secretion, the clearance ratio cannot exceed $1$.\n- PAH prediction: **Incorrect**. Our calculation ($C_{\\text{PAH}} = 720\\,\\text{mL}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$ vs. $GFR = 120\\,\\text{mL}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$) proves that secretion, not filtration, is the dominant excretion mechanism.

Using the derived relationship:\n$$\\text{Bias} = Cl_{Cr} - GFR_{true} = Cl_{Cr} - [Cl_{Cr} \\cdot (1 - f_{sec})]$$\n$$\\text{Bias} = Cl_{Cr} - Cl_{Cr} + Cl_{Cr} \\cdot f_{sec}$$\n$$\\text{Bias} = Cl_{Cr} \\cdot f_{sec}$$\nTo compute the numerical value of the bias, we must first calculate $Cl_{Cr}$ using the provided data:\n$$P_{Cr} = 1.20 \\, \\text{mg/dL}$$\n$$U_{Cr} = 150 \\, \\text{mg/dL}$$\n$$V = 1.00 \\, \\text{mL/min}$$\n$$Cl_{Cr} = \\frac{150 \\, \\text{mg/dL} \\cdot 1.00 \\, \\text{mL/min}}{1.20 \\, \\text{mg/dL}} = 125 \\, \\text{mL/min}$$\nNow, we calculate the bias using the value of $f_{sec} = 0.20$:\n$$\\text{Bias} = 125 \\, \\text{mL/min} \\cdot 0.20 = 25 \\, \\text{mL/min}$$\nThe problem demands the final result be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, the calculated value of $25$ must be expressed as $25.0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{25.0}$$", "id": "2604137"}]}
