It is a well-formulated question testing fundamental knowledge of smooth muscle excitation-contraction coupling. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Expected Response**\n\n1.  **Membrane Potential Calculation:** The membrane potential ($V_m$) of vascular smooth muscle cells is primarily determined by the potassium ($K^{+}$) gradient, as stated. The Nernst potential for $K^{+}$, $E_K$, provides a good approximation of $V_m$. The Nernst equation is $E_K = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln \\frac{[K^{+}]_o}{[K^{+}]_i}$, where $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $z$ is the ion valence ($+1$ for $K^{+}$), $F$ is Faraday's constant, and $[K^{+}]_o$ and $[K^{+}]_i$ are the extracellular and intracellular potassium concentrations, respectively. At $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ($310.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$), the term $\\frac{RT}{F}$ is approximately $26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n    -   In the control solution, $[K^{+}]_o = 5\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ and $[K^{+}]_i \\approx 140\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n        $$E_{K, \\text{control}} = (26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{5}{140}\\right) \\approx (26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\ln(0.0357) \\approx -89\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n        The resting membrane potential will be near this value, at which voltage-dependent LTCCs are predominantly in a closed state.\n\n    -   In the high $K^{+}$ solution, $[K^{+}]_o = 60\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n        $$E_{K, \\text{high K}} = (26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{60}{140}\\right) \\approx (26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\ln(0.428) \\approx -22.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n    This change from approximately $-89\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to $-23\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ constitutes a large and sustained depolarization of the smooth muscle cell membrane.\n\n2.  **Excitation-Contraction Coupling:** As stated in the problem, this depolarization increases the open probability of LTCCs. Given the high extracellular calcium concentration ($[CaCl_{2}] = 2\\,\\mathrm{mM}$) and very low resting intracellular calcium concentration, there is a strong electrochemical gradient favoring $Ca^{2+}$ influx. The opening of LTCCs leads to a significant influx of $Ca^{2+}$. This incoming $Ca^{2+}$ binds to calmodulin (CaM), and the resulting $Ca^{2+}$-CaM complex activates MLCK. Activated MLCK phosphorylates the regulatory light chain of myosin, which permits cross-bridge cycling with actin, resulting in force generation and contraction. Since the depolarization is sustained for $5\\,\\mathrm{min}$ by the high $K^{+}$ solution, the influx of $Ca^{2+}$ through LTCCs will also be sustained, leading to a maintained, or tonic, contraction.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Experimental Conditions:**\n    -   **Trial 1 (Normal $Ca^{2+}$):** Based on the derivation above, the $60\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $K^{+}$ challenge will cause a sustained depolarization, sustained $Ca^{2+}$ influx via LTCCs, and thus a sustained tonic contraction.\n    -   **Trial 2 (Nifedipine):** Nifedipine is specified as an LTCC blocker. By blocking these channels, it prevents the influx of extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ that is essential for the depolarization-induced contraction. Therefore, despite the membrane depolarization caused by $60\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $K^{+}$, the rise in intracellular $[Ca^{2+}]$ will be abolished or severely attenuated. Consequently, the contractile response will be markedly suppressed. A small residual response might remain if other minor pathways for calcium entry exist, but the primary response will be blocked.\n    -   **Trial 3 ($Ca^{2+}$-free + EGTA):** In this condition, the external source of $Ca^{2+}$ is removed. EGTA is a chelator that ensures any residual extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ is bound and unavailable. When the membrane is depolarized with $60\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $K^{+}$, LTCCs will open, but since there is no $Ca^{2+}$ in the extracellular medium, no influx can occur. Without $Ca^{2+}$ influx, MLCK is not activated, and no contraction will be produced.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. In normal $Ca^{2+}$, $60\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $KCl$ evokes a rapid rise to a maintained plateau of tension (tonic contraction). Preincubation with nifedipine markedly suppresses this response, leaving at most a small residual contraction. In $Ca^{2+}$-free solution with $EGTA$, $60\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $KCl$ fails to produce a contraction.**\n    This statement accurately describes the expected outcomes for all three trials as derived from first principles. The high $K^{+}$ causes a tonic contraction dependent on $Ca^{2+}$ influx through LTCCs. This is confirmed by its blockade by nifedipine (an LTCC inhibitor) and its abolition in the absence of extracellular $Ca^{2+}$. This option is consistent with all the provided information. **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. In normal $Ca^{2+}$, $60\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $KCl$ evokes only a brief, purely transient contraction that fully persists in $Ca^{2+}$-free solution with $EGTA$ and is unaffected by nifedipine, but is eliminated by ryanodine via depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) stores.**\n    This option describes a contraction mediated by intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ release from the SR, which is characteristic of pharmacomechanical coupling (e.g., via G-protein coupled receptors), not the electromechanical coupling induced by depolarization. A KCl-induced contraction is primarily tonic, not transient, and it is critically dependent on extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ influx, meaning it would be abolished in $Ca^{2+}$-free solution and by nifedipine. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. In normal $Ca^{2+}$, $60\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $KCl$ relaxes the ring by enhancing inward rectifier $K^{+}$ channel current and hyperpolarizing the membrane; nifedipine converts this relaxation into a contraction by blocking $Ca^{2+}$ influx that would otherwise inhibit $K^{+}$ channels.**\n    This statement is fundamentally flawed. Increasing extracellular $[K^{+}]$ from $5\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ to $60\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ brings the membrane potential closer to zero, which is depolarization, not hyperpolarization. Depolarization causes contraction, not relaxation. The logic presented is contrary to basic membrane electrophysiology. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. The contractile response to $60\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $KCl$ requires an intact endothelium because nitric oxide (NO) production is necessary for depolarization-evoked contraction; therefore, endothelium-denuded rings show no contraction, but nifedipine restores a partial response by reducing NO scavenging.**\n    This is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, the preparation is explicitly \"endothelium-denuded\". Second, nitric oxide (NO) is a potent vasodilator (causes relaxation), not a contractile agent. Its physiological role is antithetical to what is described. The entire premise is scientifically false. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **E. In normal $Ca^{2+}$, $60\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $KCl$ induces a sustained contraction that is unchanged by nifedipine and also persists in $Ca^{2+}$-free solution, demonstrating that depolarization-induced contraction in vascular smooth muscle is independent of $Ca^{2+}$ influx.**\n    This option claims the contraction is independent of $Ca^{2+}$ influx. This directly contradicts the established, fundamental mechanism of electromechanical coupling in smooth muscle, which is provided as an explicit assumption in the problem statement.

We will now calculate $P$ for the three specified conditions.\n\n**Condition 1: Baseline (no agonist)**\nHere, there is no inhibition of MLCP, so $k_{d}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = k_{d}$.\nGiven: $k_p=0.30\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $k_d=0.30\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$$P_{\\text{baseline}} = \\frac{k_p}{k_p + k_d} = \\frac{0.30\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.30\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 0.30\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.30}{0.60} = 0.50$$\nThe baseline force is $0.50\\,F_{\\max}$.\n\n**Condition 2: Agonist stimulation**\nThe agonist activates both ROCK and PKC pathways, which inhibit MLCP.\nThe inhibitory factors are $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ROCK}}=2.0$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{PKC}}=1.5$.\nThe effective phosphatase rate constant is:\n$$k_{d}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{k_d}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ROCK}} \\cdot \\sigma_{\\mathrm{PKC}}} = \\frac{0.30\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{2.0 \\cdot 1.5} = \\frac{0.30\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{3.0} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe kinase rate constant $k_p$ remains $0.30\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nThe steady-state phosphorylation is:\n$$P_{\\text{agonist}} = \\frac{k_p}{k_p + k_d^{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{0.30\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.30\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 0.10\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.30}{0.40} = 0.75$$\nWith the agonist, the force increases to $0.75\\,F_{\\max}$. This increase in force at a constant $[Ca^{2+}]$ is known as calcium sensitization.\n\n**Condition 3: Agonist plus Y-27632**\nThe ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 is added, fully blocking the ROCK pathway's effect, so $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ROCK}}$ becomes $1.0$. The PKC pathway is unaffected, so $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{PKC}}$ remains $1.5$.\nThe new effective phosphatase rate constant is:\n$$k_{d}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{k_d}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ROCK}} \\cdot \\sigma_{\\mathrm{PKC}}} = \\frac{0.30\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1.0 \\cdot 1.5} = \\frac{0.30\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1.5} = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe kinase rate constant $k_p$ is still $0.30\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nThe steady-state phosphorylation is:\n$$P_{\\text{Y-27632}} = \\frac{k_p}{k_p + k_d^{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{0.30\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.30\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 0.20\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.30}{0.50} = 0.60$$\nIn the presence of the ROCK inhibitor, the force decreases from the agonist-stimulated level but remains elevated above baseline, at $0.60\\,F_{\\max}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. With agonist at fixed $[Ca^{2+}]$, force remains unchanged at approximately $0.50\\,F_{\\max}$; after Y-27632, force is still approximately $0.50\\,F_{\\max}$ because permeabilization disrupts RhoA/ROCK signaling.**\nThis is incorrect. My calculation shows that force increases to $0.75\\,F_{\\max}$ with agonist. The premise that permeabilization disrupts the signaling is contrary to the problem statement which explicitly states G protein-coupled receptor signaling is retained and that ROCK is activated.\n\n**B. With agonist at fixed $[Ca^{2+}]$, force increases to approximately $0.75\\,F_{\\max}$; after Y-27632, force decreases to approximately $0.60\\,F_{\\max}$ and remains above baseline due to persisting PKC/CPI-17–mediated MLCP inhibition.**\nThis option's predictions are entirely consistent with my calculations. The predicted force with agonist is $0.75\\,F_{\\max}$, and after Y-27632 it is $0.60\\,F_{\\max}$. The mechanistic explanation is also correct: force remains above the baseline of $0.50\\,F_{\\max}$ because the PKC-mediated inhibition of MLCP (factor $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{PKC}}=1.5$) is not blocked by Y-27632 and continues to suppress MLCP activity.\n\n**C. With agonist at fixed $[Ca^{2+}]$, force increases to approximately $0.75\\,F_{\\max}$; after Y-27632, force returns to baseline at approximately $0.50\\,F_{\\max}$ because ROCK is the sole mediator of calcium sensitization in this preparation.**\nThis is incorrect. While the initial force increase to $0.75\\,F_{\\max}$ is correct, the claim that force returns to baseline ($0.50\\,F_{\\max}$) is false; my calculation shows it decreases only to $0.60\\,F_{\\max}$. The reasoning is also false, as the problem specifies two mediators of MLCP inhibition, ROCK and PKC.\n\n**D. With agonist at fixed $[Ca^{2+}]$, force decreases to approximately $0.25\\,F_{\\max}$ due to consumption of GTP; after Y-27632, force paradoxically increases to greater than $0.75\\,F_{\\max}$ owing to inhibition of MLCK.**\nThis option is incorrect. The agonist causes an increase, not a decrease, in force. The reasoning about GTP consumption is not relevant to the steady-state model. Furthermore, Y-27632 is a ROCK inhibitor, it does not inhibit MLCK, and it reduces, not increases, the agonist-induced force. Therefore, this statement is flawed in multiple aspects.\n\nBased on this analysis, only option B is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2603754"}]}
