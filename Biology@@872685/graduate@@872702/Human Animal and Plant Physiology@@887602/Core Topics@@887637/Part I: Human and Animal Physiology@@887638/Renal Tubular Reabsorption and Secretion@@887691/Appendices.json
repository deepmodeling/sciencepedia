From these bases, first determine the GFR from the inulin data, then derive and compute the fractional excretion of sodium (defined as the fraction of the filtered sodium load that is excreted in the urine). Express the final fractional excretion of sodium as a pure number (dimensionless), rounded to four significant figures. Based solely on its magnitude, infer whether the net tubular handling of sodium is reabsorptive or secretory, and justify your inference qualitatively in your reasoning.", "solution": "We are tasked with an analysis of renal function based on provided physiological data. The problem is approached by systematically applying the foundational definitions of renal clearance and mass balance under steady-state conditions.\n\nFirst, we determine the Glomerular Filtration Rate ($GFR$). The substance inulin is used as the gold standard for this measurement because it is freely filtered at the glomerulus and is, by assumption, neither reabsorbed nor secreted by the renal tubules. Under steady state, the rate at which inulin is filtered from the plasma into the glomerular capsule must equal the rate at which it is excreted in the urine.\n\nThe rate of urinary excretion of inulin, $E_{\\mathrm{in}}$, is defined as the product of its concentration in urine, $U_{\\mathrm{in}}$, and the urine flow rate, $V$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{in}} = U_{\\mathrm{in}} \\times V$$\nThe rate of glomerular filtration of inulin, also known as its filtered load, $FL_{\\mathrm{in}}$, is defined as the product of its concentration in plasma, $P_{\\mathrm{in}}$, and the Glomerular Filtration Rate, $GFR$.\n$$FL_{\\mathrm{in}} = P_{\\mathrm{in}} \\times GFR$$\nBy the principle of mass conservation for a substance handled only by filtration, the excretion rate must equal the filtered load:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{in}} \\times V = P_{\\mathrm{in}} \\times GFR$$\nFrom this fundamental relationship, we solve for $GFR$. The clearance of inulin is, by definition, equal to the $GFR$.\n$$GFR = \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{in}} \\times V}{P_{\\mathrm{in}}}$$\nSubstituting the provided numerical values: $P_{\\mathrm{in}} = 0.250 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot mL^{-1}}$, $U_{\\mathrm{in}} = 30.0 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot mL^{-1}}$, and $V = 1.000 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\cdot min^{-1}}$.\n$$GFR = \\frac{(30.0 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot mL^{-1}}) \\times (1.000 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\cdot min^{-1}})}{0.250 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot mL^{-1}}}$$\n$$GFR = \\frac{30.0}{0.250} \\ \\mathrm{mL \\cdot min^{-1}} = 120.0 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\cdot min^{-1}}$$\nThe Glomerular Filtration Rate for this subject is $120.0 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\cdot min^{-1}}$.\n\nNext, we derive and compute the fractional excretion of sodium, $FE_{\\mathrm{Na}}$. This dimensionless quantity is defined as the fraction of the filtered sodium load that is excreted in the urine.\n$$FE_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\frac{\\text{Sodium Excretion Rate}}{\\text{Sodium Filtered Load}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{Na}}}{FL_{\\mathrm{Na}}}$$\nThe sodium excretion rate, $E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, is the product of the urine sodium concentration, $U_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, and the urine flow rate, $V$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{Na}} = U_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\times V$$\nThe filtered load of sodium, $FL_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, is the product of the plasma sodium concentration, $P_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, and the $GFR$, assuming sodium is freely filtered.\n$$FL_{\\mathrm{Na}} = P_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\times GFR$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the formula for $FE_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ gives:\n$$FE_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\times V}{P_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\times GFR}$$\nWe now substitute the given and calculated values: $U_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 201.6 \\ \\mathrm{mmol \\cdot L^{-1}}$, $P_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 140.0 \\ \\mathrm{mmol \\cdot L^{-1}}$, $V = 1.000 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\cdot min^{-1}}$, and $GFR = 120.0 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\cdot min^{-1}}$. The units for concentration ($U_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ and $P_{\\mathrm{Na}}$) are identical, and the units for flow rate ($V$ and $GFR$) are identical. Therefore, the ratio is correctly dimensionless without any unit conversion.\n$$FE_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\frac{201.6 \\times 1.000}{140.0 \\times 120.0}$$\n$$FE_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\frac{201.6}{16800}$$\n$$FE_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 0.012$$\nThe problem requires this result to be expressed to four significant figures. The exact value is $0.012$. To present this value with four significant figures, we write it as $0.01200$.\n\nFinally, we infer the net tubular handling of sodium based on the magnitude of $FE_{\\mathrm{Na}}$. The fractional excretion represents the proportion of a filtered substance that appears in the final urine.\n- If $FE_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 1$, the amount excreted equals the amount filtered, indicating no net tubular transport.\n- If $FE_{\\mathrm{Na}} < 1$, the amount excreted is less than the amount filtered. This demonstrates net reabsorption of the substance from the tubular fluid back into the blood.\n- If $FE_{\\mathrm{Na}} > 1$, the amount excreted is greater than the amount filtered, which indicates net secretion of the substance from the blood into the tubular fluid.\n\nOur calculated value is $FE_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 0.01200$. Since $0.01200 < 1$, this signifies that only $1.200\\%$ of the sodium that was filtered at the glomerulus is ultimately excreted in the urine. The vast remainder, $100\\% - 1.200\\% = 98.8\\%$, has been removed from the tubular lumen. Therefore, the net tubular handling of sodium is overwhelmingly **reabsorptive**.
