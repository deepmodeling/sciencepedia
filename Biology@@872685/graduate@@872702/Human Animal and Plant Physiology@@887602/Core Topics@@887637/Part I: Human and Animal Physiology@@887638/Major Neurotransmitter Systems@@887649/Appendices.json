Consider a single quantal event that transiently opens AMPA receptors on a dendritic spine, producing an effective peak synaptic conductance. The spine head is electrically connected to the soma through a lumped series resistance representing the spine neck and recording access pathway. At the time of the peak of this quantal event, the following values hold:\n- Peak AMPA conductance: $g_{\\text{peak}} = 0.30\\,\\text{nS}$.\n- AMPA reversal potential: $E_{\\text{AMPA}} = 0\\,\\text{mV}$.\n- Somatic membrane potential under voltage clamp: $V_{m} = -65\\,\\text{mV}$.\n- Series resistance between the spine head and the soma: $R_{s} = 50\\,\\text{M}\\Omega$.\n\nUsing only the fundamental definitions that (i) an ohmic synaptic current through AMPA receptors equals the conductance multiplied by its driving force, and (ii) the voltage drop across a series resistance equals the current times the resistance, derive from first principles the peak postsynaptic current at the spine head during this quantal event by accounting for the voltage drop across the series resistance that separates the spine head from the somatic clamp potential.

It is a standard problem in quantitative cellular neurophysiology. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet $I_{\\text{syn}}$ be the peak postsynaptic current at the spine head, with the convention that inward current is negative. Let $V_{\\text{spine}}$ be the membrane potential at the spine head at the time of the peak current. The provided givens are:\n- Peak AMPA conductance: $g_{\\text{peak}} = 0.30\\,\\text{nS} = 0.30 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{S}$.\n- AMPA reversal potential: $E_{\\text{AMPA}} = 0\\,\\text{mV} = 0\\,\\text{V}$.\n- Somatic membrane potential: $V_{m} = -65\\,\\text{mV} = -65 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V}$.\n- Series resistance: $R_{s} = 50\\,\\text{M}\\Omega = 50 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\Omega$.\n\nThe problem is solved by establishing a system of two linear equations based on the two fundamental definitions provided.\n\nFirst, according to the definition of an ohmic synaptic current, the current $I_{\\text{syn}}$ flowing through the AMPA receptors is the product of the synaptic conductance $g_{\\text{peak}}$ and the driving force. The driving force is the difference between the local membrane potential at the spine head, $V_{\\text{spine}}$, and the reversal potential of the channel, $E_{\\text{AMPA}}$.\n$$\nI_{\\text{syn}} = g_{\\text{peak}} (V_{\\text{spine}} - E_{\\text{AMPA}})\n$$\nThis is our first equation. The sign convention is consistent: for an excitatory synapse where $V_{\\text{spine}} < E_{\\text{AMPA}}$, the current $I_{\\text{syn}}$ will be negative, corresponding to an inward flow of positive charge (e.g., $\\text{Na}^{+}$).\n\nSecond, by the principle of conservation of charge (Kirchhoff's current law), the current $I_{\\text{syn}}$ that enters the spine head through the synaptic channels must exit the spine head and flow to the soma through the series resistance $R_{s}$. The current flowing through a resistor is given by the voltage drop across it divided by the resistance. The potential at one end of the resistor is $V_{\\text{spine}}$, and at the other end is $V_{m}$. The current flowing from the spine head to the soma is therefore $\\frac{V_{\\text{spine}} - V_{m}}{R_{s}}$. This must be equal to the current exiting the spine head. The current entering the spine head is $I_{\\text{syn}}$, so the current exiting is $-I_{\\text{syn}}$.\n$$\n-I_{\\text{syn}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{spine}} - V_{m}}{R_{s}}\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to express the potential at the spine head, $V_{\\text{spine}}$, in terms of the somatic potential and the voltage drop across the series resistance:\n$$\nV_{\\text{spine}} = V_{m} - I_{\\text{syn}} R_{s}\n$$\nThis is our second equation. It shows that the potential at the spine head $V_{\\text{spine}}$ is not equal to the clamped somatic potential $V_m$, but is shifted by a voltage drop $I_{\\text{syn}}R_s$. Since we expect an inward current ($I_{\\text{syn}} < 0$), the term $-I_{\\text{syn}}R_s$ will be positive, indicating that $V_{\\text{spine}} > V_m$, as expected.\n\nWe now have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $I_{\\text{syn}}$ and $V_{\\text{spine}}$. We can solve for $I_{\\text{syn}}$ by substituting the expression for $V_{\\text{spine}}$ from the second equation into the first equation:\n$$\nI_{\\text{syn}} = g_{\\text{peak}} ( (V_{m} - I_{\\text{syn}} R_{s}) - E_{\\text{AMPA}} )\n$$\nWe distribute $g_{\\text{peak}}$ on the right-hand side:\n$$\nI_{\\text{syn}} = g_{\\text{peak}} (V_{m} - E_{\\text{AMPA}}) - g_{\\text{peak}} R_{s} I_{\\text{syn}}\n$$\nNow, we collect all terms involving $I_{\\text{syn}}$ on one side of the equation:\n$$\nI_{\\text{syn}} + g_{\\text{peak}} R_{s} I_{\\text{syn}} = g_{\\text{peak}} (V_{m} - E_{\\text{AMPA}})\n$$\nFactor out $I_{\\text{syn}}$:\n$$\nI_{\\text{syn}} (1 + g_{\\text{peak}} R_{s}) = g_{\\text{peak}} (V_{m} - E_{\\text{AMPA}})\n$$\nFinally, we isolate $I_{\\text{syn}}$ to obtain the analytical expression for the peak synaptic current:\n$$\nI_{\\text{syn}} = \\frac{g_{\\text{peak}}(V_{m} - E_{\\text{AMPA}})}{1 + g_{\\text{peak}} R_{s}}\n$$\nThis expression correctly accounts for the voltage-divider effect of the series resistance. The numerator represents the \"ideal\" current that would be measured if there were no series resistance ($R_s=0$), while the denominator $1 + g_{\\text{peak}} R_{s}$ is a dimensionless factor that reduces the magnitude of the current due to the voltage drop across $R_s$.\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values in SI units.\nFirst, calculate the dimensionless product $g_{\\text{peak}} R_{s}$:\n$$\ng_{\\text{peak}} R_{s} = (0.30 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{S}) \\times (50 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\Omega) = 15 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.015\n$$\nNext, calculate the driving force term $(V_{m} - E_{\\text{AMPA}})$:\n$$\nV_{m} - E_{\\text{AMPA}} = (-65 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V}) - (0\\,\\text{V}) = -65 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V}\n$$\nNow, substitute these values into the expression for $I_{\\text{syn}}$:\n$$\nI_{\\text{syn}} = \\frac{(0.30 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{S})(-65 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V})}{1 + 0.015} = \\frac{-19.5 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{A}}{1.015}\n$$\n$$\nI_{\\text{syn}} \\approx -19.21182266 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{A}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in picoamperes (pA), where $1\\,\\text{pA} = 10^{-12}\\,\\text{A}$.\n$$\nI_{\\text{syn}} \\approx -19.21182266\\,\\text{pA}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we obtain:\n$$\nI_{\\text{syn}} = -19.21\\,\\text{pA}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-19.21}\n$$", "id": "2578729"}, {"introduction": "A neuron's final output is the result of a delicate balance between excitation and inhibition.

It describes a standard passive membrane model, a fundamental element of computational neuroscience. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided to derive the requested quantity. The problem is valid.\n\nWe begin by applying the principle of current balance for a passive isopotential membrane in the steady state. In this condition, the temporal derivative of the membrane potential is zero ($\\frac{dV_m}{dt} = 0$), and thus the capacitive current is zero. The sum of all ionic currents flowing across the membrane must therefore be zero.

First, we must derive the steady-state excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) amplitude in the absence of the inhibitory input. In this case, the inhibitory conductance $g_{GABA}$ is zero.

The inter-stimulus interval is $\\Delta t = \\frac{1}{f}$. The dynamic process for each interval consists of two phases: instantaneous release and subsequent recovery.\n\nFirst, at the moment of the $k$-th stimulus, a fraction $p$ of the available vesicles are released. The expected number of released vesicles, which we denote as $V_k$, is given by the principle of quantal release:\n$$V_k = p R_k$$\nImmediately after this release, the number of vesicles in the pool is depleted.
