The problem provides per-head quantities which must be scaled to the macroscopic level. The assumption required for this scaling is that the muscle is homogeneous and in a steady state, such that the behavior of the total population of heads is the average behavior of a single head multiplied by the total number of heads.\n\nThe total number of ATP molecules consumed during a time interval $\\Delta t$ is the product of the number of heads, the ATPase turnover rate per head ($J$), and the time interval.\n$$ \\text{Total ATP consumed} = N_{\\text{heads}} \\times J \\times \\Delta t $$\nThe unit of $J$ is $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which represents ATP molecules per head per second.\n\nThe total force, $F_{\\text{total}}$, generated by the muscle is the product of the number of currently attached heads and the average force generated by a single attached cross-bridge, $F_{\\mathrm{cb}}$.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It provides a sufficient basis for a rigorous, principle-based derivation of the answer. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe problem requires predicting the changes to the whole-muscle properties after the selective elimination of large, fast-fatigable (type IIx) motor units. The muscle composition changes from (Type I + Type IIa + Type IIx) to (Type I + Type IIa). We must analyze the consequences for the force-frequency relationship and fatigability.\n\n#### 1. Analysis of the Force–Frequency Relationship\nThe whole-muscle force–frequency curve is the weighted sum of the individual curves of its constituent motor units. We must consider how the removal of type IIx units affects the two key features of this curve: the maximum force (plateau) and the frequency dependence (shape/position).\n\n- **Maximum Force ($F_{\\mathrm{max}}$)**: Fast fatigable (type IIx) motor units are the largest and most powerful. They consist of a large motor neuron innervating many large-diameter muscle fibers, and thus they generate the greatest force per unit. Removing this entire population of high-force contributors must lead to a significant reduction in the total maximum tetanic force the muscle can produce. Therefore, the post-lesion maximum force, $F_{\\mathrm{max,post}}$, will be substantially lower than the pre-lesion maximum force, $F_{\\mathrm{max,pre}}$. When the new force-frequency curve is normalized to the *original* maximum force ($F_{\\mathrm{max,pre}}$), its plateau will be at a value significantly less than $1$. This constitutes a **downward transformation** of the curve.\n\n- **Frequency Dependence (Shape and Position)**: The frequency required to achieve twitch fusion and tetanic contraction is inversely related to the twitch time constant, $\\tau$.\n    - Slow (type I) units: long $\\tau$, fuse at low frequencies ($f$).\n    - Fast fatigue-resistant (type IIa) units: intermediate $\\tau$, fuse at intermediate $f$.\n    - Fast fatigable (type IIx) units: short $\\tau$, require high $f$ for fusion.\nThe pre-lesion muscle's force continues to increase up to high frequencies (e.g., approaching $100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$) because the type IIx units require such high frequencies to contribute their maximal force. By removing the type IIx units, we eliminate the population that is responsive primarily to high-frequency stimulation. The remaining units (type I and IIa) achieve their maximal fused force at lower to moderate frequencies. Consequently, the post-lesion muscle as a whole will reach its (new, lower) maximal force at a lower stimulation frequency. The half-activation frequency (frequency at which $50\\%$ of the maximum force is generated) will decrease. This is a **leftward shift** of the force-frequency curve.\n\n- **Combined Effect**: The force-frequency curve undergoes both a **downward transformation** (reduced plateau) and a **leftward shift** (saturation at lower frequencies).\n\n#### 2. Analysis of Fatigability\nFatigability is the decline in force-generating capacity during sustained or repeated activity. The fatigue index quantifies this, with a higher index indicating greater fatigue resistance.\n- **Pre-lesion Muscle**: Composed of all three fiber types. The fatigue protocol ($40\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ intermittent stimulation) is sufficiently intense to recruit and cause significant fatigue in the type IIx units, which have low oxidative capacity and fatigue rapidly. This would lead to a substantial drop in force over the $120\\,\\mathrm{s}$ period and thus a relatively low fatigue index.\n- **Post-lesion Muscle**: Composed only of type I (highly fatigue-resistant) and type IIa (fatigue-resistant) motor units. These units are characterized by high oxidative capacity (many mitochondria, rich capillary supply) and are adapted for sustained activity. When subjected to the same $40\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ fatigue protocol, these units will maintain their force output much more effectively than the type IIx units they replaced.\n- **Conclusion**: The removal of the most fatigable component of the muscle results in a new whole-muscle composition that is intrinsically far more resistant to fatigue. The force measured in the last $5\\,\\mathrm{s}$ of the protocol will be much closer to the force in the first $5\\,\\mathrm{s}$. Therefore, the fatigue index will **increase**, which signifies **reduced fatigability**.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Leftward and downward transformation of the force–frequency curve: a lower half-activation frequency (lower $f$ needed for fusion) and a reduced plateau magnitude (lower $F_{\\mathrm{max}}$), with a shallower slope; fatigability is reduced (higher fatigue index) during the $40\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ intermittent protocol.**\n- **Force-Frequency Curve**: This description perfectly matches the derivation. \"Leftward\" shift means lower half-activation frequency. \"Downward\" transformation means reduced plateau magnitude. The slope becoming \"shallower\" is also a correct consequence of the reduced total force range.\n- **Fatigability**: \"fatigability is reduced (higher fatigue index)\" also perfectly matches the derivation.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Rightward and upward transformation of the force–frequency curve: a higher half-activation frequency and an increased plateau magnitude (higher $F_{\\mathrm{max}}$) due to compensatory rate coding; fatigability is increased (lower fatigue index).**\n- **Force-Frequency Curve**: \"Upward transformation\" is incorrect; removing the most powerful motor units must decrease $F_{\\mathrm{max}}$. \"Rightward transformation\" is incorrect; removing the fastest-twitching units shifts the curve left. \"Compensatory rate coding\" is a mechanism for voluntary control, not a change in the intrinsic force-frequency property measured by direct nerve stimulation.\n- **Fatigability**: \"fatigability is increased\" is incorrect.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Leftward shift of the force–frequency curve but an unchanged plateau magnitude; fatigability is unchanged because remaining units compensate fully.**\n- **Force-Frequency Curve**: \"unchanged plateau magnitude\" is incorrect. Losing a substantial fraction of the muscle's motor units, particularly the most forceful ones, must reduce $F_{\\mathrm{max}}$. Compensation by hypertrophy of remaining fibers might occur over long time scales, but it is not an immediate consequence and unlikely to be complete.\n- **Fatigability**: \"fatigability is unchanged\" is incorrect. The intrinsic properties of the muscle have been fundamentally altered by removing the most fatigable element.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Leftward and downward transformation of the force–frequency curve as in A, but fatigability is increased (lower fatigue index) because the remaining motor units are overworked and therefore fatigue faster under the same $40\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ protocol.**\n- **Force-Frequency Curve**: The description of the curve is correct.\n- **Fatigability**: The conclusion \"fatigability is increased\" is incorrect. The reasoning provided (\"remaining motor units are overworked\") is a plausible-sounding but fallacious argument in this context. The fatigue test uses a fixed stimulation paradigm ($40\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$), which probes the intrinsic endurance of the activated fibers. It does not impose a fixed mechanical work task. The remaining fibers (Type I and IIa) are intrinsically fatigue-resistant. They will exhibit their characteristic high endurance, leading to a higher fatigue index for the muscle as a whole. The concept of being \"overworked\" would apply if the task were to maintain a specific *absolute force*, not when subjected to a specific *stimulation frequency*.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2586107"}]}
