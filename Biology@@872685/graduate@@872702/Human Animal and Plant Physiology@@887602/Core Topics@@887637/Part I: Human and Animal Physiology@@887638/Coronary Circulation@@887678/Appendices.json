This system's primary tool is the modulation of vascular resistance, a task predominantly handled by the coronary arterioles.

The inflow pressure at the coronary ostia is fixed at $P_a = 95$ mmHg, the effective outflow pressure equals the right atrial pressure $P_v = 5$ mmHg (time-averaged extravascular compressive forces are assumed unchanged and subsumed into $P_v$), and the baseline total coronary blood flow is $Q_0 = 250$ mL/min.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in physiological fluid dynamics. It contains all necessary data and constraints for a unique solution.

This is given as constant.\n$$ \\Delta P_{total} = P_a - P_v = 95 \\text{ mmHg} - 5 \\text{ mmHg} = 90 \\text{ mmHg} $$\nThe coronary circulation is modeled as three resistances in series: epicardial ($R_{epi}$), arteriolar ($R_{art}$), and capillary–venous ($R_{cv}$). The total resistance $R_{total}$ is the sum of these components.\n$$ R_{total} = R_{epi} + R_{art} + R_{cv} $$\nLet us group the non-arteriolar resistances into a single term, $R_{other}$, which is stated to be unaffected by the intervention.\n$$ R_{other} = R_{epi} + R_{cv} $$\nThus, the total resistance at any time is:\n$$ R_{total} = R_{art} + R_{other} $$\nThe relationship between total pressure drop, total flow $Q$, and total resistance is given by:\n$$ \\Delta P_{total} = Q \\cdot R_{total} $$\n\nWe first analyze the system at baseline (state $0$).

The specific hemodynamic signature for this condition, as defined by the problem, is a discordance between two key indices: a reduced Coronary Flow Reserve (CFR) in the context of a normal Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR). We must also exclude cases where a low CFR is an artifact of an abnormally high resting coronary blood flow. An additional, more specific index of microvascular integrity, the Index of Microcirculatory Resistance (IMR), is calculable and will serve as a confirmatory measure.\n\nFirst, let us establish the precise quantitative criteria for our analysis, based upon the provided definitions and standard physiological values.\n1.  **Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR)**: $FFR = P_d/P_a$ during hyperemia.

This value is abnormal ($\\le 0.80$), confirming a hemodynamically significant epicardial stenosis.\n  - $CFR = \\text{Hyperemic APV} / \\text{Resting APV} = 32 / 20 = 1.6$. This value is reduced ($< 2.0$).\n- **Analysis**: This case does not meet the primary condition of having a normal FFR. The reduced CFR and FFR are concordant and explained by the flow-limiting epicardial stenosis. This is the opposite of the pattern being sought.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Evaluation of Option D:**\n- **Clinical context**: A $68$-year-old with long-standing hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), with no focal stenosis. Both hypertension and LVH are potent causes of coronary microvascular dysfunction.\n- **Data**: $P_a = 100\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, $P_d = 92\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, resting APV $= 20\\,\\mathrm{cm/s}$, hyperemic APV $= 26\\,\\mathrm{cm/s}$, $T_{mn} = 0.35\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- **Calculations**:\n  - $FFR = P_d / P_a = 92 / 100 = 0.92$. This value is normal ($> 0.80$).\n  - $CFR = \\text{Hyperemic APV} / \\text{Resting APV} = 26 / 20 = 1.30$. This value is severely reduced ($< 2.0$).\n  - $IMR = P_d \\times T_{mn} = 92\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} \\times 0.35\\,\\mathrm{s} = 32.2\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}$. This value is significantly elevated ($\\ge 25$).\n- **Analysis**: This case, similar to case A, exhibits the exact profile of reduced CFR ($1.30$) and normal FFR ($0.92$). The high IMR ($32.2$) confirms a state of high microvascular resistance. The resting flow is not elevated. The findings are attributable to MVD in the setting of hypertension and LVH.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**Evaluation of Option E:**\n- **Clinical context**: A $50$-year-old with diffuse, mild epicardial atherosclerosis. This may cause a pressure gradient along the vessel without a focal lesion.\n- **Data**: $P_a = 100\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, $P_d = 82\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, resting APV $= 22\\,\\mathrm{cm/s}$, hyperemic APV $= 33\\,\\mathrm{cm/s}$, $T_{mn} = 0.22\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- **Calculations**:\n  - $FFR = P_d / P_a = 82 / 100 = 0.82$. This value is borderline but technically normal ($> 0.80$). However, the pressure drop of $18\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ is not negligible and suggests some contribution from epicardial disease.\n  - $CFR = \\text{Hyperemic APV} / \\text{Resting APV} = 33 / 22 = 1.5$. This value is reduced ($< 2.0$).\n  - $IMR = P_d \\times T_{mn} = 82\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} \\times 0.22\\,\\mathrm{s} = 18.04\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}$. This value is normal ($< 25$).\n- **Analysis**: Here, we find a reduced CFR with a borderline-normal FFR. Crucially, the IMR is normal, which argues against significant microvascular dysfunction being the primary cause of the blunted flow reserve. The hemodynamic findings (reduced CFR and FFR of $0.82$) are more likely explained by the diffuse epicardial atherosclerosis, which is known to cause such a pattern, rather than a primary microvascular problem. Therefore, it does not *specifically* indicate MVD as the main cause.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, scenarios A and D are the only ones that precisely match the specified criteria: reduced CFR, normal FFR, and evidence of microvascular dysfunction (elevated IMR) not confounded by high resting flow or significant epicardial stenosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2559992"}]}
