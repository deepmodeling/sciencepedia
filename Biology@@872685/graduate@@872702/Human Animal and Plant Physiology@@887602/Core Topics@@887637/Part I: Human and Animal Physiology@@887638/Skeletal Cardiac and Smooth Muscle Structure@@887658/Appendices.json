The provided lengths for filaments and the sarcomere are physiologically realistic for vertebrate skeletal muscle.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed.

A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n### Derivation of Band Widths\nLet $L$ be the total length of the sarcomere, measured from Z-disc to Z-disc. We establish a coordinate system with the origin at the M-line, which is the center of the sarcomere. The Z-discs are thus located at positions $x = -L/2$ and $x = +L/2$.\n\n**A-band Width, $A(L)$:**\nThe A-band is defined as the region containing the thick myosin filament. The problem states that the thick filament has a constant length $L_{M}$. Since the thick filament's length is independent of sarcomere contraction (it is inextensible), the width of the A-band is constant.\n$$\nA(L) = L_{M}\n$$\n\n**I-band Width, $I(L)$:**\nThe I-band is the region containing only thin filaments. In a single sarcomere, this corresponds to the two regions near the Z-discs that are not occupied by the central A-band. The total length of the sarcomere is the sum of the A-band width and the widths of the two half I-bands at each end. The total width of the I-band material within one sarcomere, denoted $I(L)$, is the sum of these two regions.\n$$\nL = A(L) + I(L)\n$$\nSubstituting $A(L) = L_{M}$, we can express the I-band width as a function of the sarcomere length $L$:\n$$\nI(L) = L - L_{M}\n$$\n\n**H-zone Width, $H(L)$:**\nThe H-zone is the central region of the A-band containing only thick filaments, i.e., the region not overlapped by thin filaments. The left thin filament is anchored at the Z-disc at $x = -L/2$ and extends for a length $L_{A}$ towards the center. Its tip is therefore at $x_{\\text{tip, left}} = -L/2 + L_{A}$. The right thin filament is anchored at $x = +L/2$ and extends towards the center, so its tip is at $x_{\\text{tip, right}} = +L/2 - L_{A}$. The H-zone is the space between the tips of the two thin filaments. Its width is the distance between these two points:\n$$\nH(L) = x_{\\text{tip, right}} - x_{\\text{tip, left}} = \\left(\\frac{L}{2} - L_{A}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{L}{2} + L_{A}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nH(L) = \\frac{L}{2} - L_{A} + \\frac{L}{2} - L_{A} = L - 2L_{A}\n$$\n\n### Computation of Changes\nWe are asked to compute the changes $\\Delta A$, $\\Delta I$, and $\\Delta H$ as the sarcomere shortens from an initial length $L_{0}$ to a final length $L_{1}$. The change in length is given as $\\Delta L = 0.20\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, such that $L_{1} = L_{0} - \\Delta L$. Thus, the difference is $L_{1} - L_{0} = -\\Delta L = -0.20\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n\n**Change in A-band Width, $\\Delta A$:**\nThe width of the A-band is constant.\n$$\n\\Delta A = A(L_{1}) - A(L_{0}) = L_{M} - L_{M} = 0\n$$\n\n**Change in I-band Width, $\\Delta I$:**\nUsing the derived expression for $I(L)$:\n$$\n\\Delta I = I(L_{1}) - I(L_{0}) = (L_{1} - L_{M}) - (L_{0} - L_{M}) = L_{1} - L_{0}\n$$\nSince $L_{1} - L_{0} = -\\Delta L$:\n$$\n\\Delta I = -\\Delta L = -0.20\\,\\mu\\text{m}\n$$\n\n**Change in H-zone Width, $\\Delta H$:**\nUsing the derived expression for $H(L)$:\n$$\n\\Delta H = H(L_{1}) - H(L_{0}) = (L_{1} - 2L_{A}) - (L_{0} - 2L_{A}) = L_{1} - L_{0}\n$$\nSimilarly,\n$$\n\\Delta H = -\\Delta L = -0.20\\,\\mu\\text{m}\n$$\n\nThe results show that the A-band width remains constant, while the I-band and H-zone both decrease in width by an amount equal to the total sarcomere shortening. This is a hallmark of the sliding filament model.\n\nThe final values, rounded to four significant figures as required, are:\n$\\Delta I = -0.2000\\,\\mu\\text{m}$\n$\\Delta H = -0.2000\\,\\mu\\text{m}$\n$\\Delta A = 0.0000\\,\\mu\\text{m}$\n\nThe final answer should be reported as the ordered triple $(\\Delta I, \\Delta H, \\Delta A)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -0.2000 & -0.2000 & 0.0000 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2607622"}, {"introduction": "While the sliding filament model describes events at the molecular level, a muscle's functional output is often characterized by its macroscopic mechanical properties.
