It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous derivation. We will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the thermogenic power per gram of tissue, which we denote as $P_{\\text{tissue}}$. This power results from the dissipation of the mitochondrial proton-motive force as heat, a process mediated by the uncoupling protein $1$ ($UCP1$).\n\nThe fundamental basis provided is that the electrical work, $W$, required to move a charge $q$ across an electric potential difference $\\Delta \\psi$ is given by $W = q \\Delta \\psi$.

When the body is warmer than the environment, radiative exchange, convective exchange, and conductive exchange to the substrate represent losses and therefore enter with negative signs. Evaporation always removes latent heat and thus is a loss. The First-Law lumped balance therefore reads\n$$\nS \\equiv m_{b} c_{b} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T_{c}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\;=\\; M - R_{\\mathrm{loss}} - C_{\\mathrm{loss}} - K_{\\mathrm{loss}} - E,\n$$\nwhere each loss term is defined from fundamental heat transfer laws as follows.\n\nRadiation: Using the Stefan–Boltzmann law for diffuse-gray exchange with an isothermal surrounding at $T_{r}$,\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{loss}} \\;=\\; \\varepsilon \\sigma A_{s} \\left( T_{s}^{4} - T_{r}^{4} \\right),\n$$\nwhich is positive when $T_{s} > T_{r}$.\n\nConvection: Using Newton’s law of cooling,\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{loss}} \\;=\\; h_{c} A_{s} \\left( T_{s} - T_{a} \\right),\n$$\nwhich is positive when $T_{s} > T_{a}$.\n\nConduction to substrate: With an effective linear contact conductance,\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{loss}} \\;=\\; h_{k} A_{\\mathrm{fp}} \\left( T_{s} - T_{\\mathrm{sub}} \\right),\n$$\npositive when $T_{s} > T_{\\mathrm{sub}}$.\n\nEvaporation: By the definition of latent heat,\n$$\nE \\;=\\; \\lambda \\, \\dot{m}_{w},\n$$\nwhich is always positive as a loss.\n\nThese definitions complete the First-Law formulation. However, the storage term required to achieve a prescribed core-temperature ramp does not depend on the concurrent magnitudes of the environmental fluxes; it is fixed by the tissue heat capacity and the commanded rate $\\dot{T}_{c}$. Specifically,\n$$\nS \\;=\\; m_{b} \\, c_{b} \\, \\dot{T}_{c}.\n$$\n\nWe now compute $S$ numerically from the given parameters. First convert the ramp from per minute to per second,\n$$\n\\dot{T}_{c} \\;=\\; 0.06 \\ \\mathrm{K \\ min^{-1}} \\;=\\; \\frac{0.06}{60} \\ \\mathrm{K \\ s^{-1}} \\;=\\; 0.001 \\ \\mathrm{K \\ s^{-1}}.\n$$\nCompute the whole-body heat capacity,\n$$\nC_{b} \\;\\equiv\\; m_{b} c_{b} \\;=\\; \\left( 0.035 \\ \\mathrm{kg} \\right) \\left( 3470 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ kg^{-1} \\ K^{-1}} \\right) \\;=\\; 121.45 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ K^{-1}}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nS \\;=\\; C_{b} \\, \\dot{T}_{c} \\;=\\; \\left( 121.45 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ K^{-1}} \\right) \\left( 0.001 \\ \\mathrm{K \\ s^{-1}} \\right) \\;=\\; 0.12145 \\ \\mathrm{W}.\n$$\n\nFor completeness, one can evaluate the concurrent environmental losses to understand the metabolic requirement. Using the given temperatures and areas,\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{loss}} \\;=\\; \\left( 0.97 \\right) \\left( 5.670 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{W \\ m^{-2} \\ K^{-4}} \\right) \\left( 0.010 \\ \\mathrm{m^{2}} \\right) \\left[ \\left( 309 \\ \\mathrm{K} \\right)^{4} - \\left( 295 \\ \\mathrm{K} \\right)^{4} \\right] \\;\\approx\\; 0.877 \\ \\mathrm{W},\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{loss}} \\;=\\; \\left( 8.0 \\ \\mathrm{W \\ m^{-2} \\ K^{-1}} \\right) \\left( 0.010 \\ \\mathrm{m^{2}} \\right) \\left( 309 - 295 \\right) \\ \\mathrm{K} \\;=\\; 1.12 \\ \\mathrm{W},\n$$\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{loss}} \\;=\\; \\left( 20.0 \\ \\mathrm{W \\ m^{-2} \\ K^{-1}} \\right) \\left( 8.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m^{2}} \\right) \\left( 309 - 295 \\right) \\ \\mathrm{K} \\;=\\; 0.224 \\ \\mathrm{W},\n$$\n$$\nE \\;=\\; \\left( 2.43 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{J \\ kg^{-1}} \\right) \\left( 2.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{kg \\ s^{-1}} \\right) \\;=\\; 0.486 \\ \\mathrm{W}.\n$$\nThe total instantaneous heat loss is approximately $2.707 \\ \\mathrm{W}$, so the metabolic heat production required to realize the specified positive storage $S$ would be $M \\;=\\; S + R_{\\mathrm{loss}} + C_{\\mathrm{loss}} + K_{\\mathrm{loss}} + E \\;\\approx\\; 2.828 \\ \\mathrm{W}$. This consistency check is ancillary; the required storage rate itself is fixed by the commanded ramp and body heat capacity.\n\nFinally, rounding $S = 0.12145 \\ \\mathrm{W}$ to four significant figures gives $S = 0.1215 \\ \\mathrm{W}$ as requested.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1215}$$", "id": "2579598"}]}
