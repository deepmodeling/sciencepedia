The problem is scientifically sound and well-posed.\n\n1. Derivation of the linear relation between freezing point depression and osmolality.\n\nThe fundamental condition for phase equilibrium between a pure solid solvent (ice) and a liquid solution at the freezing temperature $T_f$ and constant pressure $P$ is the equality of the chemical potential of the solvent (water, subscript $w$) in both phases:\n$$\n\\mu_{w}^{*}(s, T_f, P) = \\mu_{w}(l, T_f, P, x_w)\n$$\nHere, $\\mu_{w}^{*}(s)$ is the chemical potential of pure solid water, and $\\mu_{w}(l)$ is the chemical potential of water in the liquid solution, which depends on its mole fraction $x_w$.\n\nFor an ideal or ideally dilute solution, the chemical potential of the solvent is related to the chemical potential of the pure liquid solvent, $\\mu_{w}^{*}(l)$, by:\n$$\n\\mu_{w}(l, T_f, P, x_w) = \\mu_{w}^{*}(l, T_f, P) + R T_f \\ln(a_w)\n$$\nwhere $a_w$ is the activity of the solvent. The problem states to assume ideal dilute behavior, where the activity is approximated by the mole fraction, $a_w \\approx x_w$. Substituting this into the equilibrium condition gives:\n$$\n\\mu_{w}^{*}(s, T_f, P) = \\mu_{w}^{*}(l, T_f, P) + R T_f \\ln(x_w)\n$$\nRearranging this equation yields:\n$$\n\\mu_{w}^{*}(s, T_f, P) - \\mu_{w}^{*}(l, T_f, P) = R T_f \\ln(x_w)\n$$\nThe left-hand side is the molar Gibbs free energy of fusion for the pure solvent at temperature $T_f$, denoted as $\\Delta G_{fus,m}(T_f)$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta G_{fus,m}(T_f)}{T_f} = R \\ln(x_w)\n$$\nA more robust derivation starting from the equilibrium condition $\\mu_w^*(s,T_f) = \\mu_w(l,T_f,x_w)$ and the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation leads to the following exact relation before any approximation:\n$$\n-R \\ln x_w = \\frac{\\Delta H_{fus,m}^* \\Delta T_f}{T_f T_f^0}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta H_{fus,m}^*$ is the molar enthalpy of fusion, $\\Delta T_f = T_f^0 - T_f$ is the freezing point depression, and $T_f^0$ is the freezing point of the pure solvent.\n\nFor a dilute solution, we make three approximations:\n1.  The mole fraction of the solvent is $x_w = 1 - x_s$, where $x_s$ is the total mole fraction of all solute particles. As $x_s \\ll 1$, we can use the Taylor series expansion $\\ln(1-z) \\approx -z$. Thus, $\\ln(x_w) = \\ln(1 - x_s) \\approx -x_s$.\n2.  For a small depression, we can approximate the denominator $T_f T_f^0 \\approx (T_f^0)^2$.\n3.  The solute mole fraction $x_s$ can be related to the osmolality $m_{\\mathrm{osm}}$. For a dilute solution, $x_s \\approx m_{\\mathrm{osm}} M_w$, where $M_w$ is the molar mass of the solvent (in $\\mathrm{kg \\cdot mol^{-1}}$).\n\nSubstituting these approximations into the exact relation:\n$$\n-R (-x_s) \\approx \\frac{\\Delta H_{fus,m}^* \\Delta T_f}{(T_f^0)^2}\n\\implies R x_s \\approx \\frac{\\Delta H_{fus,m}^* \\Delta T_f}{(T_f^0)^2}\n$$\n$$\nR (m_{\\mathrm{osm}} M_w) \\approx \\frac{\\Delta H_{fus,m}^* \\Delta T_f}{(T_f^0)^2}\n$$\nSolving for $\\Delta T_f$:\n$$\n\\Delta T_f \\approx \\left( \\frac{R (T_f^0)^2 M_w}{\\Delta H_{fus,m}^*} \\right) m_{\\mathrm{osm}}\n$$\nThis is the linear relation $\\Delta T_f = K_f m_{\\mathrm{osm}}$. The constant of proportionality is the cryoscopic constant, $K_f$, expressed in terms of fundamental thermodynamic quantities:\n$$\nK_f = \\frac{R (T_f^0)^2 M_w}{\\Delta H_{fus,m}^*}\n$$\nHere, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T_f^0$ is the freezing point of the pure solvent, $M_w$ is the molar mass of the solvent (in $\\mathrm{kg \\cdot mol^{-1}}$), and $\\Delta H_{fus,m}^*$ is the standard molar enthalpy of fusion of the solvent.\n\n2. Calculation of the sample's osmolality.\n\nThe derived relationship is $\\Delta T_f = K_f m_{\\mathrm{osm}}$. We rearrange to solve for osmolality, $m_{\\mathrm{osm}}$:\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{osm}} = \\frac{\\Delta T_f}{K_f}\n$$\nThe given values are:\n- Freezing point depression $\\Delta T_f = 0.93~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. A temperature difference is equivalent in degrees Celsius and Kelvin, so $\\Delta T_f = 0.93~\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Cryoscopic constant of water $K_f = 1.86~\\mathrm{K \\cdot kg \\cdot mol^{-1}}$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{osm}} = \\frac{0.93~\\mathrm{K}}{1.86~\\mathrm{K \\cdot kg \\cdot mol^{-1}}} = 0.5~\\mathrm{mol \\cdot kg^{-1}}\n$$\nThe unit $\\mathrm{mol \\cdot kg^{-1}}$ in this context refers to moles of osmotically active particles per kilogram of solvent, which is by definition an osmolality. Therefore, the result is $0.5~\\mathrm{osmol \\cdot kg^{-1}}$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The calculated value $0.50$ has two significant figures.\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{osm}} = 0.50~\\mathrm{osmol \\cdot kg^{-1}}\n$$\n\n3. Explanation of non-ideal solute behavior.\n\nIn real solutions, particularly physiological fluids containing electrolytes, the relationship between freezing point depression and the stoichiometric molality ($m_b$) is not simple. The stoichiometric molality is calculated from the mass of solute and its formula weight, without considering its behavior in solution. Two concepts, the van 't Hoff factor $i$ and the osmotic coefficient $\\phi$, are used to account for deviations from ideality, such as dissociation and association.\n\nThe **van 't Hoff factor ($i$)** is the ratio of the experimentally measured osmolality ($m_{\\mathrm{osm}}$) to the stoichiometric molality ($m_b$):\n$$\ni = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{osm}}}{m_b}\n$$\nThus, the freezing point depression is given by $\\Delta T_f = K_f (i \\cdot m_b)$.\n- For **strong dissociation**, such as an electrolyte like $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ dissociating into $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$, the number of particles in solution increases. For $\\mathrm{NaCl}$, one formula unit produces two ions, so ideally $i = 2$. Due to electrostatic interactions (ion pairing) in a real solution, the effective number of independent particles is reduced, making $i$ slightly less than $2$ (e.g., $i \\approx 1.87$ for $0.15~\\mathrm{M}$ $\\mathrm{NaCl}$).\n- For **strong association**, such as the formation of micelles by surfactant molecules or dimerization of carboxylic acids in nonpolar solvents, multiple solute molecules combine into a single larger particle. This reduces the total number of independent particles in solution, resulting in $i < 1$.\n\nThe **osmotic coefficient ($\\phi$)** provides a more rigorous description of non-ideality in the solvent activity, which is the ultimate source of colligative properties. It is defined through the solvent activity $a_w$ as $\\ln(a_w) = -\\phi \\nu m_b M_w$, where $\\nu$ is the number of particles produced per formula unit of solute upon dissociation (for a non-electrolyte, $\\nu=1$). In an ideal solution, $\\phi = 1$. In real electrolyte solutions, inter-ionic forces cause $\\phi < 1$.\nThe measured osmolality is related to the stoichiometric molality and the osmotic coefficient by:\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{osm}} = \\phi \\nu m_b\n$$\nBy comparing this with the definition of the van 't Hoff factor ($m_{\\mathrm{osm}} = i m_b$), we see that $i = \\phi \\nu$.\n\nIn the context of cell volume regulation, the measured osmolality, $m_{\\mathrm{osm}}$, is the physiologically critical parameter. It reflects the total concentration of all osmotically active particles and therefore dictates the osmotic pressure gradient across a cell membrane, which drives water movement. A direct measurement of $\\Delta T_f$ yields this effective osmolality, bypassing the complexities of knowing the individual concentrations and non-ideal behaviors (i.e., the values of $i$ or $\\phi$) of all solutes in a complex fluid like blood plasma.

All intracellular solutes are stated to be nonpermeant, so their reflection coefficient is $\\sigma_{in,np} = 1$. The initial volume is $V_0$.\nThe number of nonpermeant osmoles inside the cell is $N_{in,np} = C_{in,0} \\cdot V_0 = 300 \\cdot V_0$. This quantity is conserved.\n\nNew extracellular state ($t \\ge 0$): The external solution is composed of $100 \\text{ mM}$ sodium chloride (NaCl) and $100 \\text{ mM}$ urea.\nThe osmolarity contributions are:\nFor NaCl (ideal monovalent salt): $C_{NaCl} = 100 \\text{ mM} \\times 2 \\text{ osmoles/mole} = 200 \\text{ mOsm/L}$. NaCl is nonpermeant, so its reflection coefficient is $\\sigma_{NaCl} = 1$.\nFor urea: $C_{urea} = 100 \\text{ mM} \\times 1 \\text{ osmole/mole} = 100 \\text{ mOsm/L}$.

Here, $C_{out,total} = 300 \\text{ mOsm/L}$ and $C_{in,0} = 300 \\text{ mOsm/L}$, so the new solution is indeed iso-osmolar to the cell.\nThe term **isotonic** means that the external solution causes no net change in cell volume. The change in cell volume is driven by water movement, which is governed by the difference in *effective* osmolarity (also called tonicity).\nLet us calculate the effective osmolarities.\nThe initial effective intracellular osmolarity is $C_{in,eff,0} = \\sigma_{in,np} C_{in,0} = 1 \\times 300 \\text{ mOsm/L} = 300 \\text{ mOsm/L}$.\nThe effective extracellular osmolarity of the new solution is $C_{out,eff} = \\sigma_{NaCl} C_{NaCl} + \\sigma_{urea} C_{urea} = (1)(200 \\text{ mOsm/L}) + (0)(100 \\text{ mOsm/L}) = 200 \\text{ mOsm/L}$.\nAt the moment of the switch ($t=0$), we have $C_{in,eff,0} > C_{out,eff}$. This imbalance in effective osmotic pressure ($300 \\text{ mOsm/L}$ inside versus $200 \\text{ mOsm/L}$ outside) creates a water potential gradient that drives water into the cell, causing it to swell. A solution that causes a cell to swell is defined as **hypotonic**.\nThus, we have a solution that is iso-osmolar ($300 \\text{ mOsm/L}$) but hypotonic. This serves as the required counterexample and demonstrates that the two terms are not synonymous, especially in the presence of permeant solutes.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of volume ratios $V_{\\mathrm{init}}/V_0$ and $V_{\\infty}/V_0$**\nThe volume of the cell adjusts to maintain water equilibrium.

The intracellular solutes are the original nonpermeant ones and any urea that has entered.\n$C_{in,eff}(t) = \\sigma_{in,np} C_{in,np}(t) + \\sigma_{urea} C_{in,urea}(t)$.\nThe concentration of nonpermeant solutes is $C_{in,np}(t) = \\frac{N_{in,np}}{V(t)} = \\frac{300 \\cdot V_0}{V(t)}$.\nSince $\\sigma_{in,np}=1$ and $\\sigma_{urea}=0$, the effective intracellular osmolarity simplifies to:\n$C_{in,eff}(t) = (1) \\left(\\frac{300 \\cdot V_0}{V(t)}\\right) + (0) \\cdot C_{in,urea}(t) = \\frac{300 \\cdot V_0}{V(t)}$.\nThe water equilibrium condition is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{300 \\cdot V_0}{V(t)} = C_{out,eff} = 200\n$$\nThis equation determines the volume of the cell at any time $t>0$, under the assumption that water movement is much faster than solute permeation. Solving for the volume $V(t)$:\n$$\nV(t) = \\frac{300}{200} V_0 = \\frac{3}{2} V_0\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that the cell volume rapidly expands to a new, constant value and does not change further as urea permeates.\n\nCalculation of $V_{\\mathrm{init}}/V_0$:\n$V_{\\mathrm{init}}$ is defined as the volume after rapid water equilibration but before significant urea entry. Our derived equation for $V(t)$ is directly applicable to this state.\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{init}} = \\frac{3}{2} V_0 \\implies \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{init}}}{V_0} = \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\n\nCalculation of $V_{\\infty}/V_0$:\n$V_{\\infty}$ is the final, steady-state volume after urea has also come to diffusional equilibrium ($C_{in,urea}(t_{\\infty}) = C_{out,urea} = 100 \\text{ mOsm/L}$).

The subsequent entry of urea does not cause further volume change because, with a reflection coefficient of zero, it exerts no effective osmotic pressure to drive water movement.
