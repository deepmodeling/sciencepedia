It describes the Cori cycle, a fundamental concept in metabolic biochemistry, using standard assumptions and simplifications. All necessary information is provided, and the premises are consistent with established scientific principles. The problem is therefore valid, and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe task is to determine the net energetic cost, in terms of adenosine triphosphate ($\\text{ATP}$) equivalents, for one complete turn of the Cori cycle. This cycle involves two coupled processes: the anaerobic conversion of glucose to lactate in skeletal muscle, and the reconversion of lactate to glucose in the liver. We will analyze the stoichiometry of each process separately and then sum them to find the overall net reaction for the organism.\n\nFirst, we analyze the metabolic pathway in the skeletal muscle under anaerobic conditions. This involves glycolysis followed by lactate fermentation.\n\nThe overall balanced chemical equation for glycolysis, converting one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate, is:\n$$ \\text{Glucose} + 2\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{P}_i + 2\\,\\text{NAD}^+ \\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{Pyruvate} + 2\\,\\text{ATP} + 2\\,\\text{NADH} + 2\\,\\text{H}^+ $$\nIn this equation, $\\text{P}_i$ represents inorganic phosphate, and $\\text{NAD}^+ / \\text{NADH}$ represent the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Under anaerobic conditions, the cell must regenerate $\\text{NAD}^+$ from the $\\text{NADH}$ produced during glycolysis to sustain the pathway. This is accomplished by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase, which reduces pyruvate to lactate:\n$$ 2\\,\\text{Pyruvate} + 2\\,\\text{NADH} + 2\\,\\text{H}^+ \\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{Lactate} + 2\\,\\text{NAD}^+ $$\nTo obtain the net reaction for anaerobic glycolysis in the muscle, we sum these two reactions. The intermediates $2\\,\\text{Pyruvate}$, $2\\,\\text{NADH}$, $2\\,\\text{H}^+$, and $2\\,\\text{NAD}^+$ cancel out.\n$$ (\\text{Glucose} + 2\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{P}_i + 2\\,\\text{NAD}^+) + (2\\,\\text{Pyruvate} + 2\\,\\text{NADH} + 2\\,\\text{H}^+) \\rightarrow (2\\,\\text{Pyruvate} + 2\\,\\text{ATP} + 2\\,\\text{NADH} + 2\\,\\text{H}^+) + (2\\,\\text{Lactate} + 2\\,\\text{NAD}^+) $$\nThe resulting net stoichiometry for the muscle tissue is:\n$$ \\text{Glucose} + 2\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{P}_i \\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{Lactate} + 2\\,\\text{ATP} $$\nThis equation shows that for each molecule of glucose consumed, the muscle tissue achieves a net production of $2$ molecules of $\\text{ATP}$.\n\nNext, we analyze the metabolic pathway in the liver, which is gluconeogenesis from the two molecules of lactate transported from the muscle. This process is essentially the reverse of anaerobic glycolysis but requires bypassing the irreversible steps of glycolysis, which has an energetic cost.\n\nFirst, lactate is converted back to pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase:\n$$ 2\\,\\text{Lactate} + 2\\,\\text{NAD}^+ \\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{Pyruvate} + 2\\,\\text{NADH} + 2\\,\\text{H}^+ $$\nThe two molecules of pyruvate are then converted to one molecule of glucose via gluconeogenesis.

The $2\\,\\text{NADH}$ and $2\\,\\text{H}^+$ required for this process are supplied by the initial conversion of lactate to pyruvate. To find the net reaction in the liver, we sum the two liver-based reactions. The intermediates $2\\,\\text{Pyruvate}$, $2\\,\\text{NADH}$, $2\\,\\text{H}^+$, and $2\\,\\text{NAD}^+$ cancel.\n$$ (2\\,\\text{Lactate} + 2\\,\\text{NAD}^+) + (2\\,\\text{Pyruvate} + 4\\,\\text{ATP} + 2\\,\\text{GTP} + 2\\,\\text{NADH} + 2\\,\\text{H}^+) \\rightarrow (2\\,\\text{Pyruvate} + 2\\,\\text{NADH} + 2\\,\\text{H}^+) + (\\text{Glucose} + 4\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{GDP} + 6\\,\\text{P}_i + 2\\,\\text{NAD}^+) $$\nThe resulting net stoichiometry for the liver tissue is:\n$$ 2\\,\\text{Lactate} + 4\\,\\text{ATP} + 2\\,\\text{GTP} \\rightarrow \\text{Glucose} + 4\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{GDP} + 6\\,\\text{P}_i $$\nAccording to the problem statement, $\\text{GTP}$ is energetically equivalent to $\\text{ATP}$. Thus, the total energetic cost in the liver is the consumption of $4$ molecules of $\\text{ATP}$ and $2$ molecules of $\\text{GTP}$, which is equivalent to the consumption of $6$ molecules of $\\text{ATP}$.\n\nFinally, to derive the overall stoichiometry and net energy balance for one full turn of the Cori cycle, we sum the net reactions from the muscle and the liver.\n$$ \\begin{matrix} \\text{Muscle:} & \\text{Glucose} + 2\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{P}_i & \\rightarrow & 2\\,\\text{Lactate} + 2\\,\\text{ATP} \\\\ \\text{Liver:} & 2\\,\\text{Lactate} + 4\\,\\text{ATP} + 2\\,\\text{GTP} & \\rightarrow & \\text{Glucose} + 4\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{GDP} + 6\\,\\text{P}_i \\\\ \\hline \\end{matrix} $$\nSumming these equations, the metabolites Glucose and $2\\,\\text{Lactate}$ appear on both sides and thus cancel, as they are cycled between the tissues.\n$$ (\\text{Glucose} + 2\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{P}_i) + (2\\,\\text{Lactate} + 4\\,\\text{ATP} + 2\\,\\text{GTP}) \\rightarrow (2\\,\\text{Lactate} + 2\\,\\text{ATP}) + (\\text{Glucose} + 4\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{GDP} + 6\\,\\text{P}_i) $$\nThis simplifies to the net organism-level reaction involving only the energy-carrying molecules:\n$$ 2\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{P}_i + 4\\,\\text{ATP} + 2\\,\\text{GTP} \\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{ATP} + 4\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{GDP} + 6\\,\\text{P}_i $$\nTo reveal the net change, we subtract the common terms ($2\\,\\text{ATP}$, $2\\,\\text{ADP}$, $2\\,\\text{P}_i$) from both sides of the equation:\n$$ 2\\,\\text{ATP} + 2\\,\\text{GTP} \\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{GDP} + 4\\,\\text{P}_i $$\nUsing the energetic equivalence of $\\text{GTP}$ and $\\text{ATP}$ (and thus $\\text{GDP}$ and $\\text{ADP}$), the overall stoichiometry for the cycle is:\n$$ 4\\,\\text{ATP}_{\\text{eq}} \\rightarrow 4\\,\\text{ADP}_{\\text{eq}} + 4\\,\\text{P}_i $$\nThis equation represents the net hydrolysis of $4$ high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds. Therefore, one complete turn of the Cori cycle results in a net consumption of $4$ $\\text{ATP}$ equivalents by the organism.\n\nThe problem requires a single signed integer, with a negative sign indicating net consumption.

It presents a standard problem in metabolic control analysis, based on fundamental principles of thermodynamics and enzyme kinetics. The provided data (concentrations, standard free energies, constants) are biochemically realistic and self-consistent. The problem asks for an explanation of an experimental observation and a prediction based on established theory, which is a valid scientific question. No violations of the validation criteria are found.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the relationship between the actual Gibbs free energy change ($\\Delta G'$) of a reaction under cellular conditions and its role in controlling metabolic flux. The equation for $\\Delta G'$ is:\n$$ \\Delta G' = \\Delta G'^{\\circ} + RT \\ln Q $$\nwhere $\\Delta G'^{\\circ}$ is the standard transformed Gibbs free energy change, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $Q$ is the mass-action ratio, which is the ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations, each raised to the power of its stoichiometric coefficient.\n\nA reaction is considered near-equilibrium if $\\Delta G' \\approx 0$. For such reactions, both forward and reverse reactions occur at high rates that are nearly equal. Increasing the enzyme concentration increases both rates proportionally, but the net flux ($J = v_f - v_r$) is not significantly altered because it is primarily determined by the mass-action ratio $Q$, which is held close to the equilibrium constant $K'_{eq}$ by the activities of upstream and downstream enzymes. Such enzymes have a low flux control coefficient.\n\nConversely, a reaction is far from equilibrium (or irreversible) if $\\Delta G'$ is large and negative. For these reactions, the reverse rate is negligible ($v_r \\approx 0$), so the net flux is simply the forward rate ($J \\approx v_f$). These reactions are potential control points for the pathway; increasing the enzyme's activity will directly increase the flux, all else being equal. These enzymes have high flux control coefficients.\n\nWe will calculate $\\Delta G'$ for the three reactions for which data is provided.\nThe value of $RT$ is:\n$$ RT = (8.314 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1})(310 \\text{ K}) \\approx 2577 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} = 2.577 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1} $$\n\n**1. Phosphoglucose Isomerase (PGI) Reaction**\nThe reaction is G6P $\\rightleftharpoons$ F6P.\nThe mass-action ratio $Q_{PGI}$ is:\n$$ Q_{PGI} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{F6P}]}{[\\mathrm{G6P}]} = \\frac{0.10 \\text{ mM}}{0.20 \\text{ mM}} = 0.5 $$\nThe actual Gibbs free energy change $\\Delta G'_{PGI}$ is:\n$$ \\Delta G'_{PGI} = \\Delta G'^{\\circ}_{PGI} + RT \\ln Q_{PGI} $$\n$$ \\Delta G'_{PGI} = (+1.7 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}) + (2.577 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}) \\ln(0.5) $$\n$$ \\Delta G'_{PGI} = 1.7 + 2.577 \\times (-0.693) \\approx 1.7 - 1.786 = -0.086 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1} $$\nSince $\\Delta G'_{PGI} \\approx 0$, the PGI reaction is operating at near-equilibrium. This confirms that PGI has very little control over the glycolytic flux. Overexpressing it increases the enzyme's capacity, but since the reaction is already close to equilibrium, it only serves to quicken the equilibration between G6P and F6P without increasing the net flow through the pathway. The flux is instead \"pulled\" by downstream irreversible steps.\n\n**2. Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) Reaction**\nThe reaction is F6P $+$ ATP $\\to$ F1,6BP $+$ ADP.\nThe mass-action ratio $Q_{PFK-1}$ is:\n$$ Q_{PFK-1} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{F1,6BP}][\\mathrm{ADP}]}{[\\mathrm{F6P}][\\mathrm{ATP}]} = \\frac{(0.010 \\text{ mM})(0.50 \\text{ mM})}{(0.10 \\text{ mM})(5.0 \\text{ mM})} = \\frac{0.005}{0.50} = 0.01 $$\nThe actual Gibbs free energy change $\\Delta G'_{PFK-1}$ is:\n$$ \\Delta G'_{PFK-1} = \\Delta G'^{\\circ}_{PFK-1} + RT \\ln Q_{PFK-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta G'_{PFK-1} = (-14.2 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}) + (2.577 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}) \\ln(0.01) $$\n$$ \\Delta G'_{PFK-1} = -14.2 + 2.577 \\times (-4.605) \\approx -14.2 - 11.87 = -26.07 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1} $$\nThis large negative value for $\\Delta G'_{PFK-1}$ indicates that the reaction is far from equilibrium and effectively irreversible under these cellular conditions. Such steps are the primary candidates for flux control. Furthermore, the PFK-1 step is the first committed step of glycolysis, meaning its product, F1,6BP, has no major metabolic fate other than proceeding through glycolysis. This makes PFK-1 a critical point for pathway regulation.\n\n**3. Pyruvate Kinase (PK) Reaction**\nThe reaction is PEP $+$ ADP $\\to$ pyruvate $+$ ATP.\nThe mass-action ratio $Q_{PK}$ is:\n$$ Q_{PK} = \\frac{[\\text{pyruvate}][\\mathrm{ATP}]}{[\\mathrm{PEP}][\\mathrm{ADP}]} = \\frac{(0.10 \\text{ mM})(5.0 \\text{ mM})}{(0.050 \\text{ mM})(0.50 \\text{ mM})} = \\frac{0.50}{0.025} = 20 $$\nThe actual Gibbs free energy change $\\Delta G'_{PK}$ is:\n$$ \\Delta G'_{PK} = \\Delta G'^{\\circ}_{PK} + RT \\ln Q_{PK} $$\n$$ \\Delta G'_{PK} = (-31.7 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}) + (2.577 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}) \\ln(20) $$\n$$ \\Delta G'_{PK} = -31.7 + 2.577 \\times (2.996) \\approx -31.7 + 7.72 = -23.98 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1} $$\nThis large negative value for $\\Delta G'_{PK}$ also indicates that the PK reaction is far from equilibrium and a site of control.\n\n**Conclusion for Flux Control**\nBoth PFK-1 and PK are far-from-equilibrium reactions and thus are major control points. However, PFK-1 is generally considered the \"pacemaker\" of glycolysis. It is located at the entry to the committed part of the pathway and is subject to complex allosteric regulation, underscoring its primary role in controlling overall flux. Overexpressing PFK-1 would create a strong \"pull\" on its substrate F6P, thereby increasing the net flux through the entire pathway from glucose. While overexpressing PK would also increase flux, its effect might be less pronounced than that of PFK-1, which governs the committal of carbon to glycolysis. Therefore, PFK-1 is the best candidate for achieving the largest increase in flux.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. PGI operates at near-equilibrium with $\\Delta G \\approx 0$, so increasing its capacity amplifies forward and reverse rates similarly and the net flux is set by upstream and downstream driving forces; thus overexpressing PFK-1, which operates far from equilibrium and commits flux into glycolysis, will produce the largest flux increase.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our analysis. Our calculation shows $\\Delta G'_{PGI} \\approx -0.09$ kJ mol$^{-1}$, which is near equilibrium ($\\approx 0$). The explanation for its low flux control is correct. Our calculation for PFK-1 shows $\\Delta G'_{PFK-1} \\approx -26.1$ kJ mol$^{-1}$, which is far from equilibrium. PFK-1's role as the committed, flux-controlling step is accurately described.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. PGI failed to increase flux because its Michaelis constant for fructose-6-phosphate is too low to respond to higher expression; overexpressing aldolase, which has the most positive $\\Delta G'^{\\circ}$, will produce the largest flux increase.**\nThe failure of PGI overexpression is due to the near-equilibrium nature of the reaction, not a specific Michaelis constant value (which is not provided). Aldolase, despite having a large positive $\\Delta G'^{\\circ}$ (around $+23.8$ kJ mol$^{-1}$), operates near-equilibrium in the cell ($\\Delta G' \\approx 0$) because its products are rapidly consumed, keeping their concentrations very low. Therefore, overexpressing aldolase, a near-equilibrium enzyme, would not significantly increase flux.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. PGI failed to increase flux because glucose transport is rate-limiting at steady state; overexpressing hexokinase will produce the largest flux increase by trapping more glucose.**\nThis statement contradicts a direct premise of the problem, which states that \"extracellular glucose supply and transport are nonlimiting.\" Thus, the reason provided for PGI's ineffectiveness is invalid according to the problem setup.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. PGI failed to increase flux because it consumes ATP near the entry of glycolysis; overexpressing pyruvate kinase, which produces ATP at the end of glycolysis, will produce the largest flux increase by increasing the net ATP yield per glucose.**\nThe PGI reaction (G6P $\\rightleftharpoons$ F6P) is an isomerization and does not involve ATP consumption or production. The statement makes a factually incorrect claim about the biochemistry of PGI.

All numbers below are given in millimolar where applicable:\n- Case A (happy path): $V_{\\max} = 1.0$, $K_{\\mathrm{m,ATP}} = 0.10$, $K_{0.5,\\mathrm{F6P}} = 0.050$, $h_{\\mathrm{F6P}} = 2.0$, $K_{\\mathrm{i,ATP}} = 1.50$, $n_{\\mathrm{inh}} = 2.0$, fixed $[\\mathrm{F6P}] = 0.20$, scan $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$ from $0.00$ to $10.00$ with step $\\Delta[\\mathrm{ATP}] = 0.005$.\n- Case B (weak inhibition edge case): $V_{\\max} = 1.0$, $K_{\\mathrm{m,ATP}} = 0.10$, $K_{0.5,\\mathrm{F6P}} = 0.050$, $h_{\\mathrm{F6P}} = 2.0$, $K_{\\mathrm{i,ATP}} = 50.0$, $n_{\\mathrm{inh}} = 2.0$, fixed $[\\mathrm{F6P}] = 0.20$, scan $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$ from $0.00$ to $10.00$ with step $\\Delta[\\mathrm{ATP}] = 0.005$.\n- Case C (strong inhibition and moderate cooperativity): $V_{\\max} = 1.0$, $K_{\\mathrm{m,ATP}} = 0.20$, $K_{0.5,\\mathrm{F6P}} = 0.050$, $h_{\\mathrm{F6P}} = 1.5$, $K_{\\mathrm{i,ATP}} = 0.50$, $n_{\\mathrm{inh}} = 3.0$, fixed $[\\mathrm{F6P}] = 0.050$, scan $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$ from $0.00$ to $5.00$ with step $\\Delta[\\mathrm{ATP}] = 0.005$.\n- Case D (low F6P boundary condition): $V_{\\max} = 1.0$, $K_{\\mathrm{m,ATP}} = 0.050$, $K_{0.5,\\mathrm{F6P}} = 0.050$, $h_{\\mathrm{F6P}} = 2.0$, $K_{\\mathrm{i,ATP}} = 1.0$, $n_{\\mathrm{inh}} = 1.0$, fixed $[\\mathrm{F6P}] = 0.010$, scan $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$ from $0.00$ to $10.00$ with step $\\Delta[\\mathrm{ATP}] = 0.005$.\n\nYour program must produce, for each case in the order listed, a list of three floating-point numbers $[ [\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\max}, [\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\text{start}}, [\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\text{end}} ]$ in millimolar, rounded to exactly $6$ decimal places. Aggregate all four case results into a single line printed as a list of lists, for example $[[a_1,b_1,c_1],[a_2,b_2,c_2],[a_3,b_3,c_3],[a_4,b_4,c_4]]$, where each $a_i$, $b_i$, and $c_i$ is a float in mM. No other text should be printed.", "solution": "The problem requires the formulation and simulation of a kinetic model for phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), an enzyme exhibiting complex regulation. The velocity of the reaction, $v$, must be derived as a function of the concentration of adenosine triphosphate, $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$, which serves as both a substrate and an allosteric inhibitor. The derivation must adhere to a specified set of fundamental principles.\n\nFirst, we will construct the mathematical model for the reaction velocity $v$. The problem states that the effects of ligand binding to distinct sites are independent and combine multiplicatively. The overall rate is thus the product of a maximal velocity, $V_{\\max}$, and several fractional terms representing the probability of the enzyme being in a catalytically competent state with respect to each ligand. The ligands are fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) and ATP.\n\n1.  **Contribution of F6P Binding**: F6P is an allosteric activator. Its binding is described as cooperative, following a Hill-type relationship. The fractional saturation of the enzyme's activator site by F6P, which we denote $f_{\\mathrm{F6P}}$, is given by the Hill equation:\n    $$f_{\\mathrm{F6P}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{F6P}]^{h_{\\mathrm{F6P}}}}{K_{0.5,\\mathrm{F6P}}^{h_{\\mathrm{F6P}}} + [\\mathrm{F6P}]^{h_{\\mathrm{F6P}}}}$$\n    Here, $K_{0.5,\\mathrm{F6P}}$ is the half-saturation constant for F6P, and $h_{\\mathrm{F6P}}$ is the Hill coefficient for F6P binding. This term is a dimensionless fraction, representing the proportion of enzyme molecules activated by F6P.\n\n2.  **Contribution of ATP as a Substrate**: ATP binds to the catalytic site as a substrate. This interaction is described by standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The fractional occupancy of the catalytic site, $f_{\\mathrm{ATP,cat}}$, is:\n    $$f_{\\mathrm{ATP,cat}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{ATP}]}{K_{\\mathrm{m,ATP}} + [\\mathrm{ATP}]}$$\n    where $K_{\\mathrm{m,ATP}}$ is the Michaelis constant for ATP at this site. This term represents the probability that an F6P-activated enzyme has its catalytic site occupied by ATP.\n\n3.  **Contribution of ATP as an Inhibitor**: ATP also binds to a separate allosteric inhibitory site. This binding is also cooperative and follows a Hill-type relationship. The fraction of enzyme molecules with ATP bound to the inhibitory site is:\n    $$f_{\\mathrm{ATP,inh,bound}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{ATP}]^{n_{\\mathrm{inh}}}}{K_{\\mathrm{i,ATP}}^{n_{\\mathrm{inh}}} + [\\mathrm{ATP}]^{n_{\\mathrm{inh}}}}$$\n    where $K_{\\mathrm{i,ATP}}$ is the dissociation constant for ATP at the inhibitory site, and $n_{\\mathrm{inh}}$ is the corresponding Hill coefficient. The enzyme is active only when this site is *unoccupied*. The fraction of enzyme molecules that are not inhibited, $f_{\\mathrm{active}}$, is therefore $1 - f_{\\mathrm{ATP,inh,bound}}$:\n    $$f_{\\mathrm{active}} = 1 - \\frac{[\\mathrm{ATP}]^{n_{\\mathrm{inh}}}}{K_{\\mathrm{i,ATP}}^{n_{\\mathrm{inh}}} + [\\mathrm{ATP}]^{n_{\\mathrm{inh}}}} = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{i,ATP}}^{n_{\\mathrm{inh}}}}{K_{\\mathrm{i,ATP}}^{n_{\\mathrm{inh}}} + [\\mathrm{ATP}]^{n_{\\mathrm{inh}}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + ([\\mathrm{ATP}]/K_{\\mathrm{i,ATP}})^{n_{\\mathrm{inh}}}}$$\n\nCombining these three independent fractional terms multiplicatively with the maximum possible reaction velocity $V_{\\max}$ yields the complete rate equation for $v$ as a function of $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$:\n$$v([\\mathrm{ATP}]) = V_{\\max} \\cdot f_{\\mathrm{F6P}} \\cdot f_{\\mathrm{ATP,cat}} \\cdot f_{\\mathrm{active}}$$\n$$v([\\mathrm{ATP}]) = V_{\\max} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{F6P}]^{h_{\\mathrm{F6P}}}}{K_{0.5,\\mathrm{F6P}}^{h_{\\mathrm{F6P}}} + [\\mathrm{F6P}]^{h_{\\mathrm{F6P}}}} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{ATP}]}{K_{\\mathrm{m,ATP}} + [\\mathrm{ATP}]} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + ([\\mathrm{ATP}]/K_{\\mathrm{i,ATP}})^{n_{\\mathrm{inh}}}} \\right)$$\nSince $[\\mathrm{F6P}]$ is held constant for each simulation, the first term acts as a constant scaling factor. The behavior of $v$ as a function of $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$ is governed by the product of the activating (substrate) term and the inhibitory term. This product results in a velocity profile that initially increases with $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$ due to substrate binding, reaches a maximum, and then decreases at higher $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$ due to allosteric inhibition.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n1.  For each test case, a discrete grid of $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$ values is generated over the specified range with the given step size. To ensure numerical stability and inclusion of endpoints, this is best accomplished using a function like `numpy.linspace`.\n2.  The derived velocity function $v([\\mathrm{ATP}])$ is evaluated at each point on the grid, yielding an array of velocity values.\n3.  The maximum velocity $v_{\\max}$ and the corresponding ATP concentration $[\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\max}$ are identified from the computed velocity array. `numpy.argmax` is suitable for finding the index of the maximum value.\n4.  The inhibition threshold is calculated as $v_{\\text{threshold}} = \\alpha \\cdot v_{\\max}$, with $\\alpha = 0.95$.\n5.  An \"inhibition-dominated regime\" is sought within the sub-interval of the $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$ grid where $[\\mathrm{ATP}] > [\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\max}$. We search this sub-interval for all points where $v \\leq v_{\\text{threshold}}$.\n6.  If such points exist, $[\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\text{start}}$ is assigned the lowest $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$ value among them, and $[\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\text{end}}$ is assigned the highest. The monotonic decrease of the velocity function past its maximum ensures this interval is contiguous.\n7.  If no such points are found within the scanned range, both $[\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\text{start}}$ and $[\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\text{end}}$ are set to $-1$.\n8.  The resulting triplet $([\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\max}, [\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\text{start}}, [\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\text{end}})$ is computed for each case, with values rounded to six decimal places as required.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef run_simulation(params):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates the PFK-1 reaction for a given set of parameters.\n\n    Args:\n        params (dict): A dictionary containing all kinetic and simulation parameters.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list containing [ATP]_max, [ATP]_start, and [ATP]_end.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Extract parameters from the dictionary for clarity\n    V_max = params['V_max']\n    K_m_ATP = params['K_m_ATP']\n    K_05_F6P = params['K_05_F6P']\n    h_F6P = params['h_F6P']\n    K_i_ATP = params['K_i_ATP']\n    n_inh = params['n_inh']\n    F6P = params['F6P']\n    atp_min = params['atp_min']\n    atp_max_scan = params['atp_max']\n    atp_step = params['atp_step']\n    \n    # Generate a uniform grid of [ATP] values using linspace for robustness\n    num_points = int(round((atp_max_scan - atp_min) / atp_step)) + 1\n    atp_grid = np.linspace(atp_min, atp_max_scan, num_points)\n\n    # 1.
