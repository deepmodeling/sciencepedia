A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\nThe fundamental principle governing the reversal potential ($V_{\\mathrm{rev}}$) is that at this specific membrane voltage, the net transmembrane electric current ($I_{\\mathrm{net}}$) is zero. For a channel permeable to $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ and $\\mathrm{K}^+$, the total current is the sum of the individual ionic currents:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{net}} = I_{\\mathrm{Na}} + I_{\\mathrm{K}}$$\nAt the reversal potential, $I_{\\mathrm{net}} = 0$, which implies:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{Na}} = -I_{\\mathrm{K}}$$\nThis condition signifies that the inward electrical current carried by $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ ions is exactly balanced by the outward electrical current carried by $\\mathrm{K}^+$ ions. It does *not* imply that each individual current is zero. The potential at which a single ionic current vanishes is its Nernst equilibrium potential, $E_{\\mathrm{ion}}$.\n\nThe Nernst potential for an ion of valence $z$ is given by:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{ion}} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{ion,o}}}{a_{\\mathrm{ion,i}}}\\right)$$\nwhere $R$ is the gas constant ($8.314\\ \\mathrm{J}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$), $T$ is the absolute temperature ($310\\ \\mathrm{K}$), $F$ is the Faraday constant ($96485\\ \\mathrm{C}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$), and $a$ represents ionic activity. For this problem, the pre-factor $\\frac{RT}{F}$ is:\n$$\\frac{RT}{F} = \\frac{(8.314\\ \\mathrm{J}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}^{-1})(310\\ \\mathrm{K})}{96485\\ \\mathrm{C}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}} \\approx 0.0267\\ \\mathrm{V} = 26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}$$\nFor monovalent cations ($\\mathrm{Na}^+$, $\\mathrm{K}^+$), $z=1$. The individual Nernst potentials are:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{K}} = (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{K},o}}{a_{\\mathrm{K},i}}\\right) = (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{5}{140}\\right) \\approx (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV})(-3.332) \\approx -89.0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{Na}} = (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Na},o}}{a_{\\mathrm{Na},i}}\\right) = (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{145}{12}\\right) \\approx (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV})(2.492) \\approx +66.5\\ \\mathrm{mV}$$\nSince $E_{\\mathrm{K}} \\neq E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, it is impossible for both $I_{\\mathrm{K}}$ and $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ to be zero simultaneously. Therefore, the reversal potential $V_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ must lie at a value intermediate between $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$. Its precise value is determined by the relative permeabilities of the ions, as described by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) voltage equation.\n\nFor a system with $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ and $\\mathrm{K}^+$, the GHK equation is:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{rev}} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{K}} a_{\\mathrm{K},o} + P_{\\mathrm{Na}} a_{\\mathrm{Na},o}}{P_{\\mathrm{K}} a_{\\mathrm{K},i} + P_{\\mathrm{Na}} a_{\\mathrm{Na},i}} \\right)$$\nGiven the permeability ratio $P_{\\mathrm{K}}:P_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 3:1$, we can set $P_{\\mathrm{K}} = 3$ and $P_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 1$ in relative units.\n\n**Initial Condition Calculation:**\nUsing the initial activities:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{rev,initial}} = (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln \\left( \\frac{(3)(5) + (1)(145)}{(3)(140) + (1)(12)} \\right)$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{rev,initial}} = (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln \\left( \\frac{15 + 145}{420 + 12} \\right) = (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln \\left( \\frac{160}{432} \\right)$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{rev,initial}} \\approx (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln(0.3704) \\approx (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV})(-0.993) \\approx -26.5\\ \\mathrm{mV}$$\nThis calculated value is very close to the experimentally observed value of approximately $-25\\ \\mathrm{mV}$, confirming the validity of the GHK model for this system.\n\n**Prediction of Change:**\nNow, let $a_{\\mathrm{K},o}$ be increased to $15\\ \\mathrm{mM}$.\nQualitatively, increasing the external potassium activity makes the potassium gradient less steep, which makes the Nernst potential for potassium, $E_K$, less negative (depolarizes it). Since the channel is highly permeable to $\\mathrm{K}^+$, this will shift the overall reversal potential $V_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ in the positive (depolarizing) direction.\n\n**New Condition Calculation:**\n$$V_{\\mathrm{rev,new}} = (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln \\left( \\frac{(3)(15) + (1)(145)}{(3)(140) + (1)(12)} \\right)$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{rev,new}} = (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln \\left( \\frac{45 + 145}{420 + 12} \\right) = (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln \\left( \\frac{190}{432} \\right)$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{rev,new}} \\approx (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln(0.4398) \\approx (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV})(-0.821) \\approx -21.9\\ \\mathrm{mV}$$\nThe reversal potential shifts from about $-26.5\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ to about $-21.9\\ \\mathrm{mV}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The zero-current voltage is set by the condition that the permeability-weighted ionic fluxes of $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ and $\\mathrm{K}^+$ carry equal and opposite charge so that the net current is zero. Because both ions permeate, the reversal potential lies between the individual equilibria and depends on the relative permeabilities and activities, not on either single-ion equilibrium alone. With the given values it is approximately $-26\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ and shifts to approximately $-22\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ when $a_{\\mathrm{K},o}$ is raised to $15\\ \\mathrm{mM}$.**\n- The mechanistic explanation is correct. The zero-current condition requires that the inward $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ current balances the outward $\\mathrm{K}^+$ current. The reversal potential is therefore a weighted average of the Nernst potentials, dependent on permeabilities and activities.\n- The quantitative predictions are accurate. My calculation yields an initial potential of $-26.5\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ (approximated as $-26\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ in the option) and a new potential of $-21.9\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ (approximated as $-22\\ \\mathrm{mV}$). These numbers align perfectly.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The zero-current voltage equals the unweighted arithmetic mean of the two single-ion equilibrium potentials, $E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = \\left(E_{\\mathrm{K}} + E_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\right)/2$, independent of relative permeability or activities; it is therefore near $-10\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ and does not change when $a_{\\mathrm{K},o}$ is increased.**\n- This statement is fundamentally flawed. The reversal potential is a *weighted* average, where the weighting depends on permeability and concentrations (or conductance in the chord conductance model). An unweighted mean is incorrect.\n- Calculation based on their faulty premise: $(E_{\\mathrm{K}} + E_{\\mathrm{Na}})/2 \\approx (-89.0 + 66.5)/2 = -11.25\\ \\mathrm{mV}$. The value \"near $-10\\ \\mathrm{mV}$\" is consistent with this incorrect formula, but the formula itself is wrong.\n- The claim that it \"does not change when $a_{\\mathrm{K},o}$ is increased\" is also false. A change in $a_{\\mathrm{K},o}$ alters $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$, which would change even this incorrect arithmetic mean.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The zero-current voltage coincides with a gating transition that minimizes conductance; because gating kinetics determine the voltage of minimal current, the reversal potential is unrelated to ionic activities or permeabilities and will not change when $a_{\\mathrm{K},o}$ is increased.**\n- This confuses the reversal potential with other channel properties like voltage-dependent gating or block. The reversal potential is the voltage of zero current, not necessarily minimal conductance. The problem states the I-V curve is \"nearly linear\", which weighs against complex gating phenomena defining the zero-current point.\n- The assertion that $V_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ is unrelated to ionic activities or permeabilities is a gross violation of the fundamental principles of electrodiffusion.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The zero-current voltage is constrained by bulk electroneutrality to remain near $0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ regardless of channel selectivity; thus it is approximately $0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ and remains near $0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ even if $a_{\\mathrm{K},o}$ is tripled.**\n- This reflects a misunderstanding of electroneutrality. Bulk solutions are electroneutral, but this does not constrain the membrane potential—a phenomenon of charge separation across the thin membrane capacitance—to be zero. Significant membrane potentials are generated by the movement of an infinitesimal fraction of the total ions, which does not violate bulk electroneutrality.\n- The prediction of $V_{\\mathrm{rev}} \\approx 0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ is contradicted by both the problem's observation ($-25\\ \\mathrm{mV}$) and the GHK calculation.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. At zero current, each ion must be individually at electrochemical equilibrium so that their individual fluxes vanish; therefore the reversal potential must simultaneously equal both $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, which is impossible with the given activities, implying that non-ideal solution effects dominate and the reversal potential remains undefined under these conditions.**\n- The premise that individual ionic fluxes must vanish is incorrect. Only the *net* flux must be zero. The condition $I_{\\mathrm{Na}} = -I_{\\mathrm{K}}$ explicitly requires non-zero individual currents (and fluxes).\n- While it is true that $V_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ cannot simultaneously equal both $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ (as $E_{\\mathrm{K}} \\neq E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$), the conclusion that the potential is \"undefined\" is false. The situation is well-defined and described by the GHK equation.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2566353"}, {"introduction": "Having applied the Nernst and Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz formalisms to charged ions, it is essential to solidify our understanding of the concept's fundamental requirements.

Consequently, the equilibrium condition $\\tilde{\\mu}_{S,L} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{S,R}$ reduces to $\\mu_{S,L} = \\mu_{S,R}$, which in turn requires $[S]_L = [S]_R$. The imposed potential difference $\\Delta \\psi$ plays no role in the thermodynamic equilibrium condition for $S$. Therefore, it cannot sustain a concentration difference, and no Nernst potential can be defined for $S$.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. If molecules of $S$ possess a permanent dipole moment, then in a uniform transmembrane electric field the field contributes an additional $- \\mathbf{p}\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathbf{E}$ term to the electrochemical potential difference between $L$ and $R$, thereby defining a well-posed Nernst potential for $S$ that can balance its concentration gradient.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The potential energy of a dipole, $U = -\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}$, exists only where the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ is non-zero, which is within the membrane itself. The thermodynamic equilibrium is determined by the equality of the electrochemical potentials in the bulk compartments $L$ and $R$, where the electric field is assumed to be zero (as they are bulk electroneutral solutions). The dipole interaction energy affects the height of the activation energy barrier for transport, thereby influencing the *kinetics* (rate of transport), but it does not alter the potential energy of the solute in the initial (bulk compartment $L$) and final (bulk compartment $R$) states. Since the potentials in the bulk compartments are unchanged, the equilibrium condition remains $\\mu_{S,L} = \\mu_{S,R}$, leading to $[S]_L = [S]_R$. No Nernst-like potential is established.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. If a reversible symporter that couples the flux of $S$ to an ion $I$ of valence $z_I$ with fixed stoichiometry is introduced, then at thermodynamic equilibrium (zero net flux), the condition for zero net cycle free energy couples the distribution of $S$ to $\\Delta \\psi$ and the distribution of $I$. Thus, a transmembrane voltage can bias the equilibrium distribution of $S$ via coupling, yet $S$ still lacks an intrinsic Nernst potential of its own.\n\nThis statement accurately describes the principle of secondary active transport. Let the symporter translocate $n_S$ molecules of $S$ and $n_I$ ions of $I$ per cycle. At equilibrium, the net free energy change for one transport cycle ($\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}}$) must be zero.\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}} = n_S (\\tilde{\\mu}_{S,R} - \\tilde{\\mu}_{S,L}) + n_I (\\tilde{\\mu}_{I,R} - \\tilde{\\mu}_{I,L}) = 0 $$\nSubstituting the definitions for $\\tilde{\\mu}_S$ (with $z_S=0$) and $\\tilde{\\mu}_I$:\n$$ n_S (RT \\ln\\frac{[S]_R}{[S]_L}) + n_I (RT \\ln\\frac{[I]_R}{[I]_L} + z_I F \\Delta\\psi) = 0 $$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the concentration ratio of $S$:\n$$ \\ln\\frac{[S]_R}{[S]_L} = -\\frac{n_I}{n_S} \\left( \\ln\\frac{[I]_R}{[I]_L} + \\frac{z_I F \\Delta\\psi}{RT} \\right) $$\nThis result explicitly shows that the equilibrium distribution of $S$ is now dependent on $\\Delta \\psi$ and the distribution of the ion $I$. Therefore, an applied voltage can indeed sustain a concentration gradient of $S$. However, this is an indirect effect mediated by the transporter coupling the free energy of ion movement to the transport of $S$. The solute $S$ itself remains neutral and does not have an intrinsic Nernst potential. The statement correctly makes this crucial distinction.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. In sufficiently strong fields, a neutral but polarizable $S$ experiences dielectrophoretic forces that endow it with an effective valence $z_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\neq 0$, permitting assignment of a Nernst potential $V_N = (RT/z_{\\mathrm{eff}} F)\\ln([S]_R/[S]_L)$ that balances its concentration gradient exactly as if $S$ were ionic.\n\nThis statement is physically and thermodynamically unsound. The potential energy of a polarizable particle in an electric field is $U = -\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha E^2$, where $\\alpha$ is its polarizability. This interaction energy depends on the square of the electric field strength, $E^2$, not on the potential $\\psi$ itself. The resulting dielectrophoretic force depends on the gradient of $E^2$, meaning it requires a non-uniform electric field. This is fundamentally different from the electrostatic force on a charge $q$, whose potential energy is $U=q\\psi$. One cannot simply invent an \"effective valence\" $z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ to make the two phenomena analogous. The functional forms of the potential energies are different, and the concept of a Nernst potential, which arises from the linear dependence of energy on $\\psi$, is not applicable. The claim that this balances the concentration gradient \"exactly as if $S$ were ionic\" is false.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. If the membrane contains water-filled pores and there is pressure-driven solvent flow carrying $S$ from $L$ to $R$, then applying a steady $\\Delta \\psi$ can directly oppose the convective drift of $S$ and yield zero net flux at nonzero concentration gradient, thereby defining a Nernst potential for $S$ in the same thermodynamic sense as for ions.\n\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, an applied $\\Delta \\psi$ cannot **directly** oppose the drift of a neutral solute $S$. The electric field exerts force on ions, not on neutral molecules. An indirect effect is possible via electro-osmosis if the pore walls are charged, where the electric field drives the solvent, which in turn drags $S$. Second, the resulting state is a non-equilibrium steady state, not a thermodynamic equilibrium. It is a balance between diffusive flux and convective flux (solvent drag). A Nernst potential describes a true thermodynamic equilibrium where the net flux of the species is zero because its electrochemical potential is equalized across the membrane. A balance of two opposing fluxes is physically different. Therefore, one cannot define a Nernst potential \"in the same thermodynamic sense as for ions\" in this scenario.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2566335"}]}
