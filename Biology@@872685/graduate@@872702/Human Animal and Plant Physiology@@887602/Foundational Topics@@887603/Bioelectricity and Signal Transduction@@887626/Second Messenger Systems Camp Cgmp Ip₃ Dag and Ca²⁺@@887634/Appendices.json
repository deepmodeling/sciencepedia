The mass-balance ODE is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\mathrm{cAMP}]}{dt} = v_{\\mathrm{prod}} - v_{\\mathrm{deg}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the degradation by PDE follows first-order kinetics with respect to $[\\mathrm{cAMP}]$, with a rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{PDE}}$. This means the degradation rate is directly proportional to the substrate concentration:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{deg}} = k_{\\mathrm{PDE}}[\\mathrm{cAMP}]\n$$\nSubstituting this into the mass-balance equation yields the requested ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\mathrm{cAMP}]}{dt} = v_{\\mathrm{prod}} - k_{\\mathrm{PDE}}[\\mathrm{cAMP}]\n$$\n\n(ii) The production rate, $v_{\\mathrm{prod}}$, is catalyzed by AC with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as the substrate. We derive the rate law using the QSSA, as instructed.

The rate of product formation is given by $v_{\\mathrm{prod}} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}[ES]$. The QSSA assumes that the concentration of the intermediate complex $[ES]$ remains approximately constant after an initial transient phase, i.e., $\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} \\approx 0$.
