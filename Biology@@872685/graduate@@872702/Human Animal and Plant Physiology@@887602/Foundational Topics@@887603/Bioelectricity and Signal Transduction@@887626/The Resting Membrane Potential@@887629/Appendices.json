A complete solution will be derived.\n\nThe fundamental principle for determining the steady-state membrane potential, $V_m$, is charge conservation. In a steady state, the membrane potential is constant, so its time derivative is zero ($\\frac{dV_m}{dt} = 0$). According to the law of charge conservation for the membrane patch, the algebraic sum of all transmembrane current densities must be zero.\nThe total current density, $I_{total}$, is the sum of the passive leak currents for sodium ($I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$), potassium ($I_{\\mathrm{K}}$), and chloride ($I_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$), and the active pump current ($I_{\\mathrm{pump}}$).\n$$I_{total} = I_{\\mathrm{Na}} + I_{\\mathrm{K}} + I_{\\mathrm{Cl}} + I_{\\mathrm{pump}} = 0$$\nThe problem specifies that the leak pathways are ohmic.

It depends only on the pump current and the total membrane leak conductance. Note that the Nernst potentials, and thus the ion concentrations and temperature, are not needed for this specific calculation, as they cancel out. The positive (outward) pump current removes net positive charge from the cell, which must be balanced by an inward current through the leak channels.

At this steady-state potential, with zero injected current ($I_{\\text{inj}} = 0$), the sum of all transmembrane currents must be zero:\n$$ I_{total} = I_K + I_{Na} + I_p = 0 $$\nLet us adopt the convention that inward currents (positive charge moving into the cell) are depolarizing, and outward currents (positive charge moving out) are hyperpolarizing. A net depolarizing current will make $V_m$ more positive, and a net hyperpolarizing current will make $V_m$ more negative.\n- The potassium current is $I_K = g_K(V_m - E_K)$. Since $V_m = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV} > E_K = -89.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the driving force $(V_m - E_K)$ is positive, resulting in an outward flow of $\\mathrm{K}^+$. This is a hyperpolarizing current.\n- The sodium current is $I_{Na} = g_{Na}(V_m - E_{Na})$. Since $V_m = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV} < E_{Na} = +60.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the driving force $(V_m - E_{Na})$ is negative, resulting in an inward flow of $\\mathrm{Na}^+$. This is a depolarizing current.\n- The sodium-potassium pump ($I_p$) expels $3$ $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ ions for every $2$ $\\mathrm{K}^+$ ions it imports. This is a net outward movement of positive charge, so $I_p$ is a hyperpolarizing current.\n\nAt rest, the inward depolarizing current must balance the outward hyperpolarizing currents: $I_{Na} = - (I_K + I_p)$.\n\nThe goal is to design a pharmacological protocol to isolate the contribution of each component by observing the immediate change in $V_m$ upon application of a specific blocker. The constraint to use only immediate changes ($\\lesssim 60\\,\\mathrm{s}$) is critical to prevent confounds from the slow run-down of ionic gradients that would occur if a transport mechanism were blocked for a prolonged period.\n\nNow, we evaluate each proposed option.\n\n**A. Apply tetrodotoxin (TTX) first; then $\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$; finally ouabain.**\n1.  **Apply TTX**: TTX blocks the voltage-gated sodium channels responsible for the persistent sodium leak current, $I_{Na}$. This removes a depolarizing influence on the neuron. The remaining currents are the hyperpolarizing $I_K$ and $I_p$. This results in a net hyperpolarizing current, which will cause $V_m$ to become more negative (hyperpolarize). The magnitude of this immediate hyperpolarization is a direct measure of the contribution of the TTX-sensitive $I_{Na}$ to the resting potential. The prediction \"TTX causes a small hyperpolarization\" is **Correct**.\n\n2.  **Apply $\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$ (in the continued presence of TTX)**: After the initial change from TTX, $V_m$ will be more negative than $-70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ but still likely above $E_K$ since the potassium leak conductance is typically large. At any potential above $E_K$, the potassium current $I_K$ is a hyperpolarizing influence. $\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$ blocks this potassium leak current. Removing this dominant hyperpolarizing current will cause the membrane potential to shift in the depolarizing direction. The extent of this depolarization quantifies the contribution of the $\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$-sensitive potassium leak. The prediction \"$\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$ causes a clear depolarization\" is **Correct**.\n\n3.  **Apply ouabain (in the presence of TTX and $\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$)**: At this stage, both the major leak currents, $I_{Na}$ and $I_K$, are blocked. The remaining significant current is the pump current, $I_p$. As established, $I_p$ is a hyperpolarizing current. Blocking the pump with ouabain removes this hyperpolarizing influence, causing a depolarization. The magnitude of this fast depolarization directly reflects the electrogenic contribution of the pump. The prediction \"ouabain causes a small depolarization\" is **Correct**.\n\nThe sequence is logical: it peels away one component at a time, allowing for sequential quantification. By focusing on immediate changes, it respects the constraint to avoid ionic gradient rundown. Therefore, this option outlines a valid and effective experimental design.\n\n**B. Apply ouabain first; then $\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$; then TTX.**\n-   \"ouabain causes a hyperpolarization\": This is incorrect. Blocking the pump, a hyperpolarizing influence, causes depolarization.\n-   \"wait until $V_m$ re-stabilizes over several minutes\": This directly violates the problem's critical constraint to use only immediate changes to avoid confounds from shifting ionic gradients. Blocking the pump for minutes would cause significant changes in $[\\mathrm{Na}^+]_i$ and $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_i$, rendering subsequent measurements uninterpretable with respect to the initial state.\n-   \"$\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$ causes a hyperpolarization\": Incorrect. Blocking the hyperpolarizing $I_K$ causes depolarization.\n-   \"TTX causes a depolarization\": Incorrect. Blocking the depolarizing $I_{Na}$ causes hyperpolarization.\nThis option is flawed in its experimental logic and contains multiple factually incorrect predictions. It is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Apply $\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$ first; then TTX; then ouabain.**\n-   **Apply $\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$ first**: This will block the dominant hyperpolarizing leak current, $I_K$, causing a large depolarization. This part of the prediction is correct.\n-   **Next, apply TTX**: The cell is now in a depolarized state. The sodium leak current $I_{Na}$ is still a depolarizing influence. Blocking it with TTX would remove this influence, causing a hyperpolarization. The option predicts a \"further depolarization,\" which is incorrect.\n-   **Finally, apply ouabain**: The option predicts a \"slow hyperpolarization\". Blocking the pump causes a fast depolarization, not a slow hyperpolarization.\nThis option contains multiple incorrect predictions. It is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Apply TTX and ouabain simultaneously; then apply $\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$.**\nThe purpose of the experiment is to *separately* estimate the contributions of each component. This protocol applies TTX (blocking the depolarizing $I_{Na}$) and ouabain (blocking the hyperpolarizing $I_p$) at the same time. The resulting change in $V_m$ would be the net effect of removing two opposing currents, making it impossible to disentangle their individual contributions from this single step. This confounds the measurement and defeats the purpose of the experiment. The claim that this sequence is \"optimal\" is false; it is a poor design. It is **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a step-by-step analysis grounded in electrochemical principles, Option A is the only one that proposes a logically sound sequence of interventions and correctly predicts the direction of the resulting changes in membrane potential, while adhering to the methodological constraints required for a clean interpretation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2618522"}]}
