It describes a classic reaction-diffusion system based on fundamental principles of mass transport. All necessary parameters and boundary conditions are provided to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is valid. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental principle is the conservation of mass for the dissolved oxygen. In a differential control volume, the rate of change of concentration, $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t}$, is balanced by the divergence of the flux, $-\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}$, and the rate of local production or consumption, $S$. This is expressed by the general continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} + S\n$$\nThe problem specifies several conditions to simplify this general relation:\n1.  **Steady State**: The system is at steady state, so all time derivatives are zero. $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n2.  **Fick's First Law**: The flux, $\\mathbf{J}$, is due to diffusion only and is given by $\\mathbf{J} = -D \\nabla C$, where the diffusivity $D$ is a constant.\n3.  **Zeroth-Order Consumption**: Oxygen is consumed at a uniform, constant rate $q$. This represents a sink term, so $S = -q$.\n\nSubstituting these into the continuity equation yields the governing partial differential equation:\n$$\n0 = -\\nabla \\cdot (-D \\nabla C) - q\n$$\nSince $D$ is constant, it can be pulled out of the divergence operator:\n$$\n0 = D \\nabla^2 C - q\n$$\nThis is rearranged into the Poisson equation for the oxygen concentration $C$:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 C = \\frac{q}{D}\n$$\nThe problem states the tissue spheroid is approximately spherical and exhibits spherical symmetry. Therefore, the concentration $C$ is a function of the radial coordinate $r$ only, $C = C(r)$. In spherical coordinates, for a function that depends only on $r$, the Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2$ simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 C(r) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right)\n$$\nThe governing equation becomes a second-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right) = \\frac{q}{D}\n$$\nWe solve this equation by sequential integration. First, multiply by $r^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right) = \\frac{q}{D} r^2\n$$\nIntegrating with respect to $r$ gives:\n$$\nr^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} = \\int \\frac{q}{D} r^2 dr = \\frac{q}{3D} r^3 + A\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the first constant of integration. To find $A$, we apply a boundary condition. Due to spherical symmetry, the concentration profile must be smooth at the center of the sphere ($r=0$). This implies that the concentration gradient must be zero at the center: $\\frac{dC}{dr}|_{r=0} = 0$. If the gradient were non-zero, it would imply a net flux originating or terminating at a single point, which is physically impossible.\nRearranging the previous equation for the gradient:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dr} = \\frac{q}{3D} r + \\frac{A}{r^2}\n$$\nFor the gradient to be finite (specifically, zero) as $r \\to 0$, the term $\\frac{A}{r^2}$ must not diverge. This is only possible if $A=0$. Thus, our first boundary condition forces $A=0$.\nThe equation for the gradient simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dr} = \\frac{q}{3D} r\n$$\nWe integrate a second time to find the concentration profile $C(r)$:\n$$\nC(r) = \\int \\frac{q}{3D} r dr = \\frac{q}{6D} r^2 + B\n$$\nwhere $B$ is the second constant of integration. To find $B$, we apply the second boundary condition, which is the fixed concentration at the surface of the spheroid: $C(R) = C_0$.\n$$\nC(R) = \\frac{q}{6D} R^2 + B = C_0\n$$\nSolving for $B$:\n$$\nB = C_0 - \\frac{q}{6D} R^2\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $B$ back into the equation for $C(r)$, we obtain the final steady-state oxygen concentration profile within the spheroid:\n$$\nC(r) = \\frac{q}{6D} r^2 + \\left( C_0 - \\frac{q}{6D} R^2 \\right) = C_0 - \\frac{q}{6D} (R^2 - r^2)\n$$\nThis profile is parabolic, with its maximum value $C_0$ at the surface ($r=R$) and its minimum value at the center ($r=0$).\n\nThe problem imposes the physiological requirement that the concentration must remain non-negative everywhere within the tissue, i.e., $C(r) \\ge 0$ for all $r \\in [0, R]$. Since the minimum concentration occurs at the center, this condition is satisfied if and only if $C(0) \\ge 0$.\nThe concentration at the center is:\n$$\nC(0) = C_0 - \\frac{q}{6D} (R^2 - 0^2) = C_0 - \\frac{q}{6D} R^2\n$$\nApplying the non-negativity constraint:\n$$\nC_0 - \\frac{q}{6D} R^2 \\ge 0\n$$\nWe rearrange this inequality to find the constraint on the radius $R$:\n$$\nC_0 \\ge \\frac{q}{6D} R^2 \\implies R^2 \\le \\frac{6DC_0}{q} \\implies R \\le \\sqrt{\\frac{6DC_0}{q}}\n$$\nThe maximum admissible radius, $R_{\\max}$, is the radius at which the central concentration becomes exactly zero. It is the upper bound of this inequality.\n$$\nR_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6DC_0}{q}}\n$$\nIf the spheroid's radius $R$ exceeds $R_{\\max}$, its central region will become anoxic ($C(r)  0$), which is physically impossible and signifies that the zeroth-order consumption model breaks down. A necrotic core would form.\n\nFinally, we relate this result to the surface area-to-volume (SA:V) ratio. For a sphere of radius $R$:\nSurface Area, $SA = 4\\pi R^2$\nVolume, $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$\nThe ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{SA}{V} = \\frac{4\\pi R^2}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3} = \\frac{3}{R}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the SA:V ratio scales as $R^{-1}$. As an object grows, its volume increases faster than its surface area, and this ratio decreases. The surface is the only interface for diffusive supply, while the entire volume represents the metabolic demand. The SA:V ratio is therefore a geometric measure of the capacity for supply relative to the magnitude of demand.\nAt the maximum radius $R_{\\max}$, the critical SA:V ratio is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{SA}{V}\\right)_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{3}{R_{\\max}} = 3 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{6DC_0}{q}}\\right)^{-1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9q}{6DC_0}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3q}{2DC_0}}\n$$\nThis critical ratio represents the minimum SA:V ratio required for the diffusive supply of oxygen to meet the metabolic demand of the entire volume without any part becoming anoxic. If the spheroid grows larger, its SA:V ratio falls below this critical value, and the supply becomes insufficient to maintain oxygenation at the center. The expression shows that a higher consumption rate $q$ or lower supply parameters $D$ and $C_0$ necessitate a larger SA:V ratio (i.e., a smaller size) to remain viable. This is the fundamental physical constraint limiting the size of avascular tissues.

The given numerical values for physiological parameters and mass transfer coefficients are within a realistic range. The assumptions, such as steady state and well-mixed bulk phases, are standard idealizations used to construct a tractable model. The problem is objective, free of ambiguity, and internally consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Total Oxygen Uptake Rate**\n\nThe total oxygen uptake rate, $N$, is the molar flow of oxygen from the bulk water to the bulk blood. According to the two-film theory, this process involves overcoming two resistances in series: one in the water film adjacent to the lamellar surface and one in the blood film.\n\nLet $p_{i}$ be the partial pressure of oxygen at the water-blood interface. The problem states that partial pressure is continuous across the interface. The molar rate of oxygen transfer across the water-side film, $N_{w}$, is given by Fick's law:\n$$N_{w} = k_{w} A_{w} (p_{w,\\mathrm{bulk}} - p_{i})$$\nSimilarly, the molar rate of transfer across the blood-side film, $N_{b}$, is:\n$$N_{b} = k_{b} A_{b} (p_{i} - p_{b,\\mathrm{bulk}})$$\nUnder steady-state conditions with no accumulation in the interface tissue, the flux must be continuous. Therefore, the total uptake rate $N$ is equal to the rate through each film:\n$$N = N_{w} = N_{b}$$\nWe have a system of two equations with one unknown intermediate variable, $p_{i}$. We can solve for $p_{i}$ from the first equation:\n$$p_{i} = p_{w,\\mathrm{bulk}} - \\frac{N}{k_{w} A_{w}}$$\nSubstitute this expression for $p_{i}$ into the second equation:\n$$N = k_{b} A_{b} \\left( \\left( p_{w,\\mathrm{bulk}} - \\frac{N}{k_{w} A_{w}} \\right) - p_{b,\\mathrm{bulk}} \\right)$$\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for $N$.\n$$N = k_{b} A_{b} (p_{w,\\mathrm{bulk}} - p_{b,\\mathrm{bulk}}) - \\frac{k_{b} A_{b}}{k_{w} A_{w}} N$$\nGroup the terms containing $N$:\n$$N + \\frac{k_{b} A_{b}}{k_{w} A_{w}} N = k_{b} A_{b} (p_{w,\\mathrm{bulk}} - p_{b,\\mathrm{bulk}})$$\n$$N \\left( 1 + \\frac{k_{b} A_{b}}{k_{w} A_{w}} \\right) = k_{b} A_{b} (p_{w,\\mathrm{bulk}} - p_{b,\\mathrm{bulk}})$$\n$$N \\left( \\frac{k_{w} A_{w} + k_{b} A_{b}}{k_{w} A_{w}} \\right) = k_{b} A_{b} (p_{w,\\mathrm{bulk}} - p_{b,\\mathrm{bulk}})$$\nIsolating $N$ gives the final expression for the total oxygen uptake rate:\n$$N = \\frac{k_{w} A_{w} k_{b} A_{b}}{k_{w} A_{w} + k_{b} A_{b}} (p_{w,\\mathrm{bulk}} - p_{b,\\mathrm{bulk}})$$\nThis is equivalent to the expression based on an overall mass transfer coefficient or total resistance. The total resistance $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is the sum of the individual film resistances, $R_{w}$ and $R_{b}$:\n$$R_{w} = \\frac{1}{k_{w} A_{w}}$$\n$$R_{b} = \\frac{1}{k_{b} A_{b}}$$\n$$N = \\frac{p_{w,\\mathrm{bulk}} - p_{b,\\mathrm{bulk}}}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{p_{w,\\mathrm{bulk}} - p_{b,\\mathrm{bulk}}}{\\frac{1}{k_{w} A_{w}} + \\frac{1}{k_{b} A_{b}}}$$\nThis confirms the derived expression.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Lamellar Surface Area per Gill Volume**\n\nThe problem requires us to find the ratio $A_{\\ell}/V_{\\mathrm{gill}}$. The total oxygen uptake rate $N$ must equal the fish's metabolic requirement, $M$. We are given the simplifying assumption that $A_{w} = A_{b} = A_{\\ell}$. Substituting these into the derived expression for $N$:\n$$M = \\frac{p_{w,\\mathrm{bulk}} - p_{b,\\mathrm{bulk}}}{\\frac{1}{k_{w} A_{\\ell}} + \\frac{1}{k_{b} A_{\\ell}}}$$\nWe can factor out $1/A_{\\ell}$ from the denominator:\n$$M = \\frac{p_{w,\\mathrm{bulk}} - p_{b,\\mathrm{bulk}}}{\\frac{1}{A_{\\ell}} \\left(\\frac{1}{k_{w}} + \\frac{1}{k_{b}}\\right)} = A_{\\ell} \\frac{p_{w,\\mathrm{bulk}} - p_{b,\\mathrm{bulk}}}{\\frac{1}{k_{w}} + \\frac{1}{k_{b}}}$$\nWe now solve for the required lamellar area, $A_{\\ell}$:\n$$A_{\\ell} = M \\frac{\\frac{1}{k_{w}} + \\frac{1}{k_{b}}}{p_{w,\\mathrm{bulk}} - p_{b,\\mathrm{bulk}}}$$\nThe problem asks for the ratio $A_{\\ell}/V_{\\mathrm{gill}}$:\n$$\\frac{A_{\\ell}}{V_{\\mathrm{gill}}} = \\frac{M}{V_{\\mathrm{gill}}} \\frac{\\frac{1}{k_{w}} + \\frac{1}{k_{b}}}{p_{w,\\mathrm{bulk}} - p_{b,\\mathrm{bulk}}}$$\nWe are given the following values:\n$M = 5.20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$V_{\\mathrm{gill}} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}$\n$k_{w} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}$\n$k_{b} = 5.00 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}$\n$p_{w,\\mathrm{bulk}} = 18.0\\,\\mathrm{kPa} = 18.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n$p_{b,\\mathrm{bulk}} = 3.00\\,\\mathrm{kPa} = 3.00 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n\nFirst, calculate the overall partial pressure difference:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{overall}} = p_{w,\\mathrm{bulk}} - p_{b,\\mathrm{bulk}} = (18.0 - 3.00) \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 15.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\nNext, calculate the sum of the inverse mass transfer coefficients (which represents the total resistance per unit area):\n$$\\frac{1}{k_{w}} + \\frac{1}{k_{b}} = \\frac{1}{2.00 \\times 10^{-8}} + \\frac{1}{5.00 \\times 10^{-8}} = (0.500 \\times 10^{8}) + (0.200 \\times 10^{8})$$\n$$\\frac{1}{k_{w}} + \\frac{1}{k_{b}} = 7.00 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$$\nNow, substitute these values into the expression for $A_{\\ell}/V_{\\mathrm{gill}}$:\n$$\\frac{A_{\\ell}}{V_{\\mathrm{gill}}} = \\frac{5.20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{2.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}} \\times \\frac{7.00 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}}{15.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}}$$\n$$\\frac{A_{\\ell}}{V_{\\mathrm{gill}}} = 2.60\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3} \\times \\frac{7.00}{15.0} \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}$$\n$$\\frac{A_{\\ell}}{V_{\\mathrm{gill}}} = 2.60 \\times \\frac{7.00}{15.0} \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$$\n$$\\frac{A_{\\ell}}{V_{\\mathrm{gill}}} = \\frac{18.2}{15.0} \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} = 1.21333... \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $1.213 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$.\n\nThe data for water flow rate $\\dot{V}_{w}$ and Henry's coefficient $H_{c,w}$ allow for a consistency check of the high-flow assumption.

The NFP expression simplifies to:\n$$\\text{NFP} = P_{\\mathrm{GC}} - P_{\\mathrm{BS}} - \\pi_{\\mathrm{GC}}$$\nThus, the volumetric flux per kidney volume is $J_V = L_p S (\\text{NFP})$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the baseline state (subscript $0$). The baseline NFP, $\\text{NFP}_0$, is calculated using the provided parameters:\n$P_{\\mathrm{GC},0} = 52\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n$P_{\\mathrm{BS},0} = 14\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n$\\pi_{\\mathrm{GC},0} = 23\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n\n$$\\text{NFP}_0 = P_{\\mathrm{GC},0} - P_{\\mathrm{BS},0} - \\pi_{\\mathrm{GC},0} = 52 - 14 - 23 = 15\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$$\nThe baseline volumetric flux per kidney volume, $J_{V,0}$, is:\n$$J_{V,0} = L_{p,0} S_0 (\\text{NFP}_0) = L_{p,0} S_0 (15)$$\n\nNext, we analyze the diabetic nephropathy state (subscript $1$). We must first determine the new values for the parameters.\nThe surface area is reduced: $S_1 = 0.75 S_0$.\nThe hydraulic permeability, $L_p$, scales inversely with the glomerular basement membrane thickness, $\\delta$.\n$$L_{p,1} = L_{p,0} \\left( \\frac{\\delta_0}{\\delta_1} \\right) = L_{p,0} \\left( \\frac{320\\ \\mathrm{nm}}{640\\ \\mathrm{nm}} \\right) = 0.5 L_{p,0}$$\nThe pressures for the diabetic state are:\n$P_{\\mathrm{GC},1} = 52\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n$P_{\\mathrm{BS},1} = 18\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n$\\pi_{\\mathrm{GC},1} = 25\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n\nNow, we calculate the NFP for the diabetic state, $\\text{NFP}_1$:\n$$\\text{NFP}_1 = P_{\\mathrm{GC},1} - P_{\\mathrm{BS},1} - \\pi_{\\mathrm{GC},1} = 52 - 18 - 25 = 9\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$$\nThe volumetric flux per kidney volume in the diabetic state, $J_{V,1}$, is:\n$$J_{V,1} = L_{p,1} S_1 (\\text{NFP}_1)$$\nSubstituting the relationships for $L_{p,1}$ and $S_1$:\n$$J_{V,1} = (0.5 L_{p,0}) (0.75 S_0) (9) = 0.375 L_{p,0} S_0 (9)$$\n\nThe problem asks for the multiplicative change, which is the ratio of the diabetic flux to the baseline flux, $\\frac{J_{V,1}}{J_{V,0}}$.\n$$\\frac{J_{V,1}}{J_{V,0}} = \\frac{0.375 L_{p,0} S_0 (9)}{L_{p,0} S_0 (15)}$$\nThe terms $L_{p,0}$ and $S_0$ cancel, leaving a purely numerical ratio.\n$$\\frac{J_{V,1}}{J_{V,0}} = \\frac{0.375 \\times 9}{15} = \\frac{3.375}{15}$$\nPerforming the final division:\n$$\\frac{3.375}{15} = 0.225$$\nThe question requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.225$ already contains exactly three significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.225}$$", "id": "2611684"}]}
