In our setting, $u,v,w,p,\\phi,\\psi,\\chi(M)$ are all positive, so $A_{1} > 0$ and $A_{3} > 0$ hold automatically. Loss of stability via a Hopf bifurcation (a complex-conjugate pair crossing the imaginary axis) occurs when a pair of eigenvalues lies on the imaginary axis and the Routh–Hurwitz boundary is met. Setting $\\lambda = \\mathrm{i}\\,\\omega$ with $\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ and separating real and imaginary parts yields the well-known relations at the Hopf point:\n\n$$\n\\text{Real part:}\\quad -A_{1}\\,\\omega^{2} + A_{3} \\;=\\; 0 \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; A_{3} \\;=\\; A_{1}\\,\\omega^{2},\n$$\n\n\n$$\n\\text{Imaginary part:}\\quad -\\omega^{3} + A_{2}\\,\\omega \\;=\\; 0 \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; \\omega^{2} \\;=\\; A_{2}.\n$$\n\nCombining them gives the boundary condition $A_{1}A_{2} = A_{3}$, consistent with Routh–Hurwitz, and the angular frequency of small oscillations at Hopf is\n\n$$\n\\omega_{H} \\;=\\; \\sqrt{A_{2}} \\;=\\; \\sqrt{uv + uw + vw + p\\,\\chi(M)}.\n$$\n\n\nFinally, we incorporate the microbiome modulation as specified: assume the cortisol-to-ACTH inhibitory slope magnitude at equilibrium scales with the SCFA signal as\n\n$$\n\\chi(M) \\;=\\; \\chi_{0}\\,(1+\\gamma M)\n$$\n, with constants $\\chi_{0} > 0$ and $\\gamma \\ge 0$.
