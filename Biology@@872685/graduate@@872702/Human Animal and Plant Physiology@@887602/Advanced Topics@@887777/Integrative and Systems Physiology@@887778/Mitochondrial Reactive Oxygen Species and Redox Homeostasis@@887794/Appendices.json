Within the mitochondrial matrix, superoxide is rapidly and effectively converted by manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD, also called superoxide dismutase 2, SOD2) into hydrogen peroxide with the stoichiometry $2\\,\\mathrm{O}_{2}^{\\cdot-} + 2\\,\\mathrm{H}^{+} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2} + \\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Assume that this dismutation is effectively instantaneous compared to downstream hydrogen peroxide removal, so that matrix hydrogen peroxide production is determined purely by the superoxide generation rate and the reaction stoichiometry.\n\nHydrogen peroxide in the matrix is removed by two enzyme systems that are normally enriched in the mitochondrial matrix: peroxiredoxin 3 (Prx3) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1). Due to a mutant targeting signal, a fraction of GPx1 is mislocalized to the cytosol. As a result, only a fraction $f$ of the normal matrix GPx1 activity remains in the matrix; Prx3 localization is unaffected. Both Prx3 and GPx1 operate here in the low-substrate regime where their rates are approximately first order in the matrix hydrogen peroxide concentration $C_{m}$, with pseudo-first-order rate constants $k_{\\mathrm{Prx3}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{GPx1}}^{0}$, respectively, when fully localized to the matrix. Because only a fraction $f$ of GPx1 remains in the matrix, the effective matrix rate constant for GPx1 becomes $f\\,k_{\\mathrm{GPx1}}^{0}$.\n\nHydrogen peroxide can also diffuse out of the matrix across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the intermembrane space and onward to the cytosol, which is well-buffered by cytosolic catalase (CAT). This transmembrane exchange is modeled as a first-order leak with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{leak}}$ proportional to the difference between the matrix concentration $C_{m}$ and the cytosolic concentration $C_{c}$, which is effectively clamped by cytosolic scavenging.\n\nStarting only from conservation of mass at steady state (production equals removal) and the above kinetic assumptions, derive the steady-state equation for $C_{m}$ and compute its value for the following physiologically plausible parameters:\n- Matrix superoxide production rate $r_{m} = 300\\,\\mathrm{nM\\,s^{-1}}$.\n- Matrix hydrogen peroxide production is determined solely by SOD2 stoichiometry.\n- Prx3 pseudo-first-order constant $k_{\\mathrm{Prx3}} = 0.80\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n- GPx1 pseudo-first-order constant when fully localized $k_{\\mathrm{GPx1}}^{0} = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$; fraction retained in the matrix $f = 0.50$.\n- Leak constant $k_{\\mathrm{leak}} = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n- Cytosolic hydrogen peroxide concentration $C_{c} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nExpress your final numerical answer for the steady-state matrix hydrogen peroxide concentration $C_{m}$ in nanomolar (nM), and round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem as stated requires the derivation of the steady-state concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the mitochondrial matrix, denoted as $C_{m}$.

All parameters are provided, and the objective is clearly defined. The problem is well-posed and self-contained. Therefore, it is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the principle of conservation of mass. At steady state, the total rate of production of a species within a control volume must equal its total rate of removal. Here, the species is hydrogen peroxide ($\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$) and the control volume is the mitochondrial matrix.\n\nLet $C_{m}$ be the steady-state concentration of $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the matrix.

This stoichiometry indicates that $2$ molecules of superoxide yield $1$ molecule of hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the rate of $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ production is one-half the rate of superoxide production:\n$$ V_{\\text{prod}} = \\frac{1}{2} r_{m} $$\n\nNext, we define the rates of $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ removal. There are three pathways described:\n$1$. Enzymatic removal by peroxiredoxin 3 (Prx3), which is a first-order process with respect to $C_{m}$. The rate, $V_{\\text{Prx3}}$, is:\n$$ V_{\\text{Prx3}} = k_{\\mathrm{Prx3}} C_{m} $$\n$2$. Enzymatic removal by glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1).

Diffusion across the inner mitochondrial membrane, modeled as a first-order leak. The net rate of removal from the matrix, $V_{\\text{leak}}$, is proportional to the concentration difference between the matrix and the cytosol, $(C_m - C_c)$:\n$$ V_{\\text{leak}} = k_{\\mathrm{leak}}(C_{m} - C_{c}) $$\n\nThe total rate of removal is the sum of these individual rates:\n$$ (\\text{Rate of Removal}) = V_{\\text{Prx3}} + V_{\\text{GPx1}} + V_{\\text{leak}} $$\n$$ (\\text{Rate of Removal}) = k_{\\mathrm{Prx3}} C_{m} + f k_{\\mathrm{GPx1}}^{0} C_{m} + k_{\\mathrm{leak}}(C_{m} - C_{c}) $$\n\nNow, we set the production rate equal to the total removal rate to satisfy the steady-state condition:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} r_{m} = k_{\\mathrm{Prx3}} C_{m} + f k_{\\mathrm{GPx1}}^{0} C_{m} + k_{\\mathrm{leak}}(C_{m} - C_{c}) $$\n\nThe objective is to solve this algebraic equation for $C_{m}$. We collect all terms containing $C_{m}$ on one side:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} r_{m} = C_{m}(k_{\\mathrm{Prx3}} + f k_{\\mathrm{GPx1}}^{0} + k_{\\mathrm{leak}}) - k_{\\mathrm{leak}}C_{c} $$\nIsolating the $C_{m}$ terms:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} r_{m} + k_{\\mathrm{leak}}C_{c} = C_{m}(k_{\\mathrm{Prx3}} + f k_{\\mathrm{GPx1}}^{0} + k_{\\mathrm{leak}}) $$\nFinally, we solve for $C_{m}$ by dividing:\n$$ C_{m} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} r_{m} + k_{\\mathrm{leak}}C_{c}}{k_{\\mathrm{Prx3}} + f k_{\\mathrm{GPx1}}^{0} + k_{\\mathrm{leak}}} $$\nThis is the symbolic solution for the steady-state matrix hydrogen peroxide concentration.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values to find the specific value of $C_{m}$ in nanomolar units.\nThe parameters are:\n$r_{m} = 300\\,\\mathrm{nM\\,s^{-1}}$\n$C_{c} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{Prx3}} = 0.80\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{GPx1}}^{0} = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n$f = 0.50$\n$k_{\\mathrm{leak}} = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = \\frac{1}{2} (300) + (0.20)(10) = 150 + 2 = 152 \\,\\mathrm{nM\\,s^{-1}} $$\nNext, calculate the denominator:\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = 0.80 + (0.50)(0.60) + 0.20 = 0.80 + 0.30 + 0.20 = 1.30 \\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} $$\n\nNow, compute the value of $C_m$:\n$$ C_{m} = \\frac{152}{1.30} \\,\\mathrm{nM} \\approx 116.92307... \\,\\mathrm{nM} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ C_{m} \\approx 117 \\,\\mathrm{nM} $$\nThis is the final numerical result.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{117}\n$$", "id": "2583834"}, {"introduction": "The continuous detoxification of ROS is an energy-dependent process that relies on a steady supply of reducing equivalents, primarily in the form of NADPH.

First, multiply by the denominator $1 + \\frac{k_1 x}{k_2 [\\mathrm{Trx}_{\\mathrm{red}}]}$:\n$$\nJ_p \\left( 1 + \\frac{k_1 x}{k_2 [\\mathrm{Trx}_{\\mathrm{red}}]} \\right) = k_1 x [\\mathrm{Prx}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} + k_{\\ell} x \\left( 1 + \\frac{k_1 x}{k_2 [\\mathrm{Trx}_{\\mathrm{red}}]} \\right)\n$$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$\nJ_p + \\frac{J_p k_1}{k_2 [\\mathrm{Trx}_{\\mathrm{red}}]} x = k_1 [\\mathrm{Prx}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} x + k_{\\ell} x + \\frac{k_1 k_{\\ell}}{k_2 [\\mathrm{Trx}_{\\mathrm{red}}]} x^2\n$$\nCollecting terms on one side:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{k_1 k_{\\ell}}{k_2 [\\mathrm{Trx}_{\\mathrm{red}}]} \\right) x^2 + \\left( k_1 [\\mathrm{Prx}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} + k_{\\ell} - \\frac{J_p k_1}{k_2 [\\mathrm{Trx}_{\\mathrm{red}}]} \\right) x - J_p = 0\n$$\nThe coefficients of the quadratic equation are:\n$a = \\frac{k_1 k_{\\ell}}{k_2 [\\mathrm{Trx}_{\\mathrm{red}}]}$\n$b = k_1 [\\mathrm{Prx}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} + k_{\\ell} - \\frac{J_p k_1}{k_2 [\\mathrm{Trx}_{\\mathrm{red}}]}$\n$c = -J_p$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$k_2 [\\mathrm{Trx}_{\\mathrm{red}}] = (1.0 \\times 10^6) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-5}) = 10\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$a = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^7) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-1})}{10} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^6}{10} = 1.0 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$b = (1.0 \\times 10^7)(5.0 \\times 10^{-5}) + (1.0 \\times 10^{-1}) - \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-8})(1.0 \\times 10^7)}{10}$\n$b = 500 + 0.1 - \\frac{0.1}{10} = 500 + 0.1 - 0.01 = 500.09\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$c = -1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nThe quadratic equation for $x=[\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}_2]$ becomes:\n$$\n(1.0 \\times 10^5) x^2 + 500.09 x - (1.0 \\times 10^{-8}) = 0\n$$\nThe solution for a quadratic equation is $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. Since concentration must be a positive value, we take the positive root. A direct application of this formula can lead to catastrophic cancellation error when $b^2 \\gg |4ac|$, which is the case here:\n$b^2 = (500.09)^2 \\approx 2.5 \\times 10^5$\n$|4ac| = 4 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^5) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-8}) = 4.0 \\times 10^{-3}$\nAs $b^2 \\gg |4ac|$, we can either use the numerically stable form of the solution, $x = \\frac{2c}{-b - \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}$, or use the approximation $x \\approx -c/b$. Both methods yield a reliable result. Using the approximation:\n$$\nx \\approx -\\frac{c}{b} = -\\frac{-1.0 \\times 10^{-8}}{500.09} \\approx 1.99964026 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{M}\n$$\nThis approximation is highly accurate because the quadratic term $ax^2$ is negligible compared to the linear term $bx$. This is physically equivalent to noting that the concentration of $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}_2$ is so low that the peroxiredoxin pool is almost entirely in its reduced state, $[\\mathrm{Prx}_{\\mathrm{red}}] \\approx [\\mathrm{Prx}]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n\nThe calculated steady-state concentration is $x = 1.99964 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{M}$.\nThe problem requires the answer in nanomolar (nM), where $1\\ \\mathrm{nM} = 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{M}$.\n$$\n[\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}_2] = (1.99964 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{M}) \\times \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{nM}}{10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{M}} = 1.99964 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{nM} = 0.0199964\\ \\mathrm{nM}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.02000\\ \\mathrm{nM}$.
