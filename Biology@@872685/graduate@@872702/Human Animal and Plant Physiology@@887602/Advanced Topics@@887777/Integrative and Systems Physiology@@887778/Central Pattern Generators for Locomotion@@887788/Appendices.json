Calculation of the Applied Current, $I_{\\mathrm{app}}$**\n\nThe problem states that when the neuron is under excitation alone ($g_{\\mathrm{inh}} = 0$), its potential settles at a steady-state value $E_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{exc}} = -45 \\text{ mV}$. At steady state, $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 0$.

Shunting inhibition produces a **smaller oscillation amplitude**.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Inter-burst Interval (Rise Time)**\n\nAfter inhibition is released, $g_{\\mathrm{inh}} = 0$. The neuron's voltage evolves according to:\n$$C\\,\\frac{dV}{dt}=-g_L\\,(V-E_L) + I_{\\mathrm{app}} = -g_L (V - (E_L + I_{\\mathrm{app}}/g_L))$$\nWe recognize the term in the parenthesis as $E_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{exc}} = -45 \\text{ mV}$. So,\n$$C\\,\\frac{dV}{dt}=-g_L\\,(V-E_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{exc}})$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation with time constant $\\tau_m = C/g_L$.\n$$\\tau_m = \\frac{100 \\text{ pF}}{10 \\text{ nS}} = \\frac{100 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ F}}{10 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ S}} = 10 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ s} = 10 \\text{ ms}$$\nThe solution is $V(t) = E_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{exc}} + (V(0) - E_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{exc}}) e^{-t/\\tau_m}$.\nWe need to find the time $t_{\\mathrm{rise}}$ to go from the initial voltage $V(0) = V_{\\mathrm{trough}}$ to the final voltage $V(t_{\\mathrm{rise}}) = V_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n$$V_{\\mathrm{th}} = E_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{exc}} + (V_{\\mathrm{trough}} - E_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{exc}}) e^{-t_{\\mathrm{rise}}/\\tau_m}$$\n$$\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{th}} - E_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{exc}}}{V_{\\mathrm{trough}} - E_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{exc}}} = e^{-t_{\\mathrm{rise}}/\\tau_m}$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{rise}} = -\\tau_m \\ln{\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{th}} - E_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{exc}}}{V_{\\mathrm{trough}} - E_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{exc}}}\\right)} = \\tau_m \\ln{\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{trough}} - E_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{exc}}}{V_{\\mathrm{th}} - E_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{exc}}}\\right)}$$\nThe denominator is constant: $V_{\\mathrm{th}} - E_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{exc}} = -50 \\text{ mV} - (-45 \\text{ mV}) = -5 \\text{ mV}$.\n\n- **Case 1: Hyperpolarizing inhibition**\n$$t_{\\mathrm{rise}}^{\\mathrm{hyp}} = (10 \\text{ ms}) \\ln{\\left(\\frac{-74.17 - (-45)}{-5}\\right)} = (10 \\text{ ms}) \\ln{\\left(\\frac{-29.17}{-5}\\right)} \\approx 10 \\ln(5.834) \\approx 17.6 \\text{ ms}$$\n\n- **Case 2: Shunting inhibition**\n$$t_{\\mathrm{rise}}^{\\mathrm{sh}} = (10 \\text{ ms}) \\ln{\\left(\\frac{-61.67 - (-45)}{-5}\\right)} = (10 \\text{ ms}) \\ln{\\left(\\frac{-16.67}{-5}\\right)} \\approx 10 \\ln(3.334) \\approx 12.0 \\text{ ms}$$\n\n**Comparison of Oscillation Frequencies**\n\nThe oscillation period is $T = t_{\\mathrm{active}} + t_{\\mathrm{rise}}$. The problem states $t_{\\mathrm{active}}$ is constant. Our calculation shows $t_{\\mathrm{rise}}^{\\mathrm{sh}} < t_{\\mathrm{rise}}^{\\mathrm{hyp}}$.\nTherefore, the total period for shunting inhibition is shorter than for hyperpolarizing inhibition: $T^{\\mathrm{sh}} < T^{\\mathrm{hyp}}$.\nSince frequency $f = 1/T$, it follows that $f^{\\mathrm{sh}} > f^{\\mathrm{hyp}}$. Shunting inhibition produces a **higher oscillation frequency**.\n\n### Summary and Evaluation of Options\n\nCompared to hyperpolarizing inhibition, shunting inhibition results in a **smaller amplitude** and a **higher frequency**.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. Smaller oscillation amplitude and higher oscillation frequency, because shunting primarily increases total conductance (reducing input resistance and effective time constants) without producing a large hyperpolarizing shift, shortening the rise to threshold after release.**\n- `Smaller oscillation amplitude`: Correct.\n- `higher oscillation frequency`: Correct.\n- `Reasoning`: The reasoning is entirely correct. Shunting inhibition increases the total conductance $g_L+g_{inh}$, which clamps the voltage near $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}^{\\mathrm{sh}}$, preventing a deep hyperpolarization. This \"trough\" voltage is thus higher (less negative) and closer to the spike threshold $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$. Consequently, the time required to reach threshold upon release from inhibition is shorter, leading to a faster rhythm. The smaller voltage difference between peak and trough results in a smaller amplitude.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Larger oscillation amplitude and lower oscillation frequency, because inhibition is strongest near rest for shunting synapses, driving larger excursions and slower escape from inhibition.**\n- `Larger oscillation amplitude`: Incorrect. The amplitude is smaller.\n- `lower oscillation frequency`: Incorrect. The frequency is higher.\n- `Reasoning`: The reasoning is flawed. Clamping the voltage near rest (as shunting does) *prevents* large excursions, it does not drive them.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Similar amplitude and frequency, because both forms add the same $g_{\\mathrm{inh}}$ during inhibition, so the dynamics are effectively unchanged.**\n- `Similar amplitude and frequency`: Incorrect.\n- `Reasoning`: This is a fundamental error. While $g_{\\mathrm{inh}}$ is the same, the synaptic reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ is different, which profoundly changes the synaptic current $I_{\\mathrm{syn}} = g_{\\mathrm{inh}}(V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$ and thus the steady-state voltage during inhibition.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Smaller oscillation amplitude and lower oscillation frequency, because higher conductance during shunting slows the membrane’s voltage dynamics and prolongs the inter-burst interval.**\n- `Smaller oscillation amplitude`: Correct.\n- `lower oscillation frequency`: Incorrect. The frequency is higher.\n- `Reasoning`: The reasoning is incorrect. A higher conductance $g$ leads to a smaller membrane time constant $\\tau = C/g$, which means the membrane voltage changes *faster*, not slower.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Larger oscillation amplitude and higher oscillation frequency, because shunting inhibition acts divisively on excitatory drive, amplifying burst peaks while speeding the rhythm.**\n- `Larger oscillation amplitude`: Incorrect.\n- `higher oscillation frequency`: Correct.\n- `Reasoning`: The reasoning about \"amplifying burst peaks\" is false. Inhibition, by definition, counteracts excitation; it does not amplify peaks. The amplitude is reduced.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nOnly option A is fully consistent with the derived results and provides a correct physical explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2556964"}, {"introduction": "To create more robust and flexible rhythms, biological CPGs often incorporate activity-dependent mechanisms that go beyond simple static connections.

We will proceed by first deriving the complete system of differential equations, then describing the numerical simulation and analysis a-priori, and finally executing the simulation for the specified test cases.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Model Equations**\n\nThe system consists of two identical, reciprocally inhibitory neuronal units, indexed by $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, with the presynaptic partner of unit $i$ denoted by $j \\neq i$. The state of the system is described by four variables: the firing rates $r_1(t)$ and $r_2(t)$, and the fractions of available synaptic resources $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$.\n\n**Synaptic Resource Dynamics:**\nThe dynamics of the available synaptic resource fraction, $x_i(t)$, for neuron $i$ are governed by two competing processes: recovery and depletion.\n-   Recovery: The resource pool replenishes towards its maximum normalized value of $1$. This is modeled as a first-order process with time constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}$, contributing a term $\\frac{1 - x_i(t)}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}}$.\n-   Depletion: Resources are consumed by presynaptic activity. The rate of consumption is proportional to the presynaptic firing rate $r_i(t)$, the amount of available resources $x_i(t)$, and the utilization factor $u$. This contributes a term $-u \\, x_i(t) \\, r_i(t)$.\n\nCombining these gives the differential equation for the synaptic resource fraction:\n$$\n\\frac{dx_i}{dt} = \\frac{1 - x_i}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}} - u \\, x_i \\, r_i\n$$\nThis equation holds for $i=1$ and $i=2$.\n\n**Neuronal Firing Rate Dynamics:**\nThe firing rate of each neuron, $r_i(t)$, relaxes towards a value determined by its net input, $h_i(t)$. This is modeled as a first-order low-pass filter with a time constant $\\tau_r$:\n$$\n\\tau_r \\frac{dr_i}{dt} = -r_i + F(h_i)\n$$\nwhere $F(h_i)$ is the static input-output function.\n\nThe net input $h_i$ to neuron $i$ is the sum of a constant external drive $I_0$ and the synaptic inhibition from neuron $j$. The problem specifies that the effective inhibitory drive from neuron $j$, let us call it $I_{syn, j}$, is proportional to the product of utilization $u$, available resources $x_j$, and presynaptic rate $r_j$. Thus, $I_{syn, j}(t) = u \\, x_j(t) \\, r_j(t)$.

For a generic state variable $y(t)$ with dynamics $\\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y, t)$, the update rule is:\n$$\ny(t + \\Delta t) = y(t) + \\Delta t \\cdot f(y(t), t)\n$$\nThis rule is applied at each time step for all four state variables. To ensure physical constraints are met, the firing rates $r_i$ will be clipped at $0$ (i.e., $r_i = \\max(0, r_i)$) and resource fractions $x_i$ will be clipped to the interval $[0, 1]$ after each update step.\n\nThe simulation runs for a total duration $T_{\\mathrm{sim}}$. The initial conditions are set to break the symmetry and initiate oscillations: $r_1(0) = 2.0 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $r_2(0) = 1.0 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and $x_1(0) = x_2(0) = 1.0$.\n\nAfter the simulation, we analyze the resulting time series to compute the required metrics. An initial transient period covering the first half of the simulation ($t \\in [0, T_{\\mathrm{sim}}/2]$) is discarded to ensure measurements are taken from the steady-state oscillatory behavior.\n\n-   **Activity Difference:** We compute $\\Delta(t) = r_1(t) - r_2(t)$.\n-   **Event Detection:** We identify all time points where $\\Delta(t)$ crosses zero. A crossing occurs between time steps $t_k = k \\Delta t$ and $t_{k+1}$ if $\\Delta(t_k) \\cdot \\Delta(t_{k+1}) < 0$.\n    -   An **up-crossing** (start of a burst for unit $1$) occurs if $\\Delta(t_k) < 0$ and $\\Delta(t_{k+1}) \\geq 0$.\n    -   A **down-crossing** (end of a burst for unit $1$) occurs if $\\Delta(t_k) > 0$ and $\\Delta(t_{k+1}) \\leq 0$.\n-   **Interburst Interval (IBI):** We find all up-crossing times $t_{up}$ that occur after the transient period. The IBIs are the time differences between consecutive up-crossings. The mean of these IBIs is computed. If fewer than two up-crossings are found in the analysis window, no IBI can be calculated, and the mean IBI is reported as $0.0$.\n-   **Synaptic Resource at Termination ($x_{\\mathrm{term}}$):** At each zero-crossing time $t_k$ after the transient, we record the resource level of the neuron that was just active. The value at $t_k^- \\approx t_k$ is used.\n    -   If $\\Delta(t_k) > 0$ (a down-crossing), unit $1$ was active. We record $x_1(t_k)$.\n    -   If $\\Delta(t_k) < 0$ (an up-crossing), unit $2$ was active. We record $x_2(t_k)$.\n    The mean of these recorded resource values is computed. If no crossings occur in the analysis window, the mean value is reported as $0.0$.\n\nThe special case where $u=0$ (Case D) corresponds to uncoupled neurons. In this scenario, the inhibitory term $w \\, u \\, x_j \\, r_j$ is zero, and both neurons will independently converge to a stable steady state given by $r^* = F(I_0)$. No oscillations will occur, so $\\Delta(t)$ will not cross zero. This correctly yields an IBI and $x_{\\mathrm{term}}$ of $0.0$.\n\nThe described procedure is implemented for each test case to produce the final results.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the simulation for all test cases and print results.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Fixed parameters as specified in the problem statement.\n    r_max = 100.0  # s^-1\n    a = 4.0      # dimensionless\n    theta = 1.0  # dimensionless\n    I_0 = 1.3    # dimensionless\n    w = 3.0      # dimensionless\n    tau_r = 0.02   # s\n    dt = 0.001   # s\n    T_sim = 20.0   # s\n\n    # Initial conditions.\n    r1_0 = 2.0  # s^-1\n    r2_0 = 1.0  # s^-1\n    x1_0 = 1.0  # dimensionless\n    x2_0 = 1.0  # dimensionless\n\n    # Test cases: (tau_rec, u)\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.5, 0.5),  # Case A\n        (1.5, 0.5),  # Case B\n        (0.3, 0.3),  # Case C\n        (0.5, 0.0),  # Case D\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n\n    for tau_rec, u in test_cases:\n        # Number of time steps\n        num_steps = int(T_sim / dt)\n        \n        # State variable arrays\n        r1 = np.zeros(num_steps)\n        r2 = np.zeros(num_steps)\n        x1 = np.zeros(num_steps)\n        x2 = np.zeros(num_steps)\n        t = np.linspace(0, T_sim, num_steps)\n\n        # Set initial conditions\n        r1[0] = r1_0\n        r2[0] = r2_0\n        x1[0] = x1_0\n        x2[0] = x2_0\n\n        # Static sigmoidal nonlinearity F(h)\n        def F(h):\n            return r_max / (1.0 + np.exp(-a * (h - theta)))\n\n        # Forward Euler integration loop\n        for k in range(num_steps - 1):\n            # Calculate inputs to each neuron\n            h1 = I_0 - w * u * x2[k] * r2[k]\n            h2 = I_0 - w * u * x1[k] * r1[k]\n\n            # Calculate derivatives\n            dr1_dt = (-r1[k] + F(h1)) / tau_r\n            dr2_dt = (-r2[k] + F(h2)) / tau_r\n            dx1_dt = (1.0 - x1[k]) / tau_rec - u * x1[k] * r1[k]\n            dx2_dt = (1.0 - x2[k]) / tau_rec - u * x2[k] * r2[k]\n\n            # Update state variables\n            r1[k+1] = r1[k] + dt * dr1_dt\n            r2[k+1] = r2[k] + dt * dr2_dt\n            x1[k+1] = x1[k] + dt * dx1_dt\n            x2[k+1] = x2[k] + dt * dx2_dt\n\n            # Apply physical constraints (clipping)\n            r1[k+1] = max(0.0, r1[k+1])\n            r2[k+1] = max(0.0, r2[k+1])\n            x1[k+1] = np.clip(x1[k+1], 0.0, 1.0)\n            x2[k+1] = np.clip(x2[k+1], 0.0, 1.0)\n\n        # Analysis of results\n        delta = r1 - r2\n        \n        # Find all zero-crossings\n        # np.diff(np.sign(delta)) is non-zero at crossings\n        crossings_indices = np.where(np.diff(np.sign(delta)))[0]\n\n        # Define transient discard time\n        analysis_start_time = T_sim / 2.0\n        \n        # Find up-crossings (delta changes from - to +)\n        # This means delta[k] < 0 and delta[k+1] > 0\n        up_crossing_indices = crossings_indices[delta[crossings_indices] < 0]\n        up_crossing_times = t[up_crossing_indices]\n\n        # Filter events after transient period\n        valid_up_crossing_times = up_crossing_times[up_crossing_times > analysis_start_time]\n\n        # Calculate mean IBI\n        if len(valid_up_crossing_times) >= 2:\n            ibis = np.diff(valid_up_crossing_times)\n            mean_ibi = np.mean(ibis)\n        else:\n            mean_ibi = 0.0\n\n        # Calculate mean x at termination\n        term_x_values = []\n        valid_crossings_indices = crossings_indices[t[crossings_indices] > analysis_start_time]\n\n        for idx in valid_crossings_indices:\n            # If delta[idx] > 0, it means the crossing is from + to -, so neuron 1 was active\n            if delta[idx] > 0:\n                term_x_values.append(x1[idx])\n            # If delta[idx] < 0, it means the crossing is from - to +, so neuron 2 was active\n            else:\n                term_x_values.append(x2[idx])\n\n        if term_x_values:\n            mean_x_term = np.mean(term_x_values)\n        else:\n            mean_x_term = 0.0\n\n        #\n        # A special check for the case of no oscillations at all\n        # If fewer than 2 total up-crossings, it is non-oscillatory.\n        if len(up_crossing_times) < 2:\n            mean_ibi = 0.0\n            mean_x_term = 0.0\n\n        all_results.append([round(mean_ibi, 3), round(mean_x_term, 3)])\n\n    # Format final output as a list of lists\n    output_str = \"[\" + \",\".join([f\"[{ibi},{x}]\" for ibi, x in all_results]) + \"]\"\n    print(output_str)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2557001"}, {"introduction": "A crucial aspect of motor control is the ability to modulate the output of CPGs, for instance, to change the speed of locomotion. This practice bridges theoretical modeling with experimental pharmacology by simulating the effects of a glutamatergic antagonist on a locomotor CPG. You will apply the Hill equation—a cornerstone of receptor theory—to a hypothetical set of dose-response data to determine the cooperativity of receptor binding, providing quantitative insight into how descending neuromodulatory inputs can control the frequency and amplitude of rhythmic motor patterns. [@problem_id:2556988]", "problem": "In an in vitro mammalian spinal cord preparation that generates a locomotor rhythm via a Central Pattern Generator (CPG), a competitive antagonist of ionotropic glutamate receptors is bath-applied at concentration $C$ to partially block glutamatergic transmission. Assume the following foundational bases.\n\n- Receptor occupancy under mass action with possible cooperativity: the fraction of receptors blocked (antagonist occupancy) follows a Hill binding isotherm with Hill coefficient $n$ and half-maximal inhibitory concentration $IC_{50}$, so that the blocked fraction is $B(C)$ and the unblocked (effective) glutamatergic drive is $E(C) = 1 - B(C)$, where\n$$\nB(C) = \\frac{C^{n}}{C^{n} + IC_{50}^{n}}, \\quad E(C) = \\frac{IC_{50}^{n}}{C^{n} + IC_{50}^{n}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{C}{IC_{50}}\\right)^{n}}.\n$$\n- Near the operating point, the CPG oscillation amplitude $A(C)$ in a representative excitatory interneuron scales proportionally with the effective glutamatergic drive, $A(C) = k_{A} \\, E(C)$ for some constant $k_{A} > 0$.\n- Near the same operating point, the CPG oscillation frequency $f(C)$ depends approximately affinely on the effective glutamatergic drive, $f(C) = f_{\\min} + k_{f} \\, E(C)$, where $f_{\\min} \\ge 0$ represents the frequency that would be approached as $E(C) \\to 0$, and $k_{f} > 0$ is a gain constant.\n\nIn one experiment, the following measurements were made:\n- Baseline (no antagonist, $C=0$): oscillation amplitude $A(0) = 5.0 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$ and frequency $f(0) = 0.80 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$.\n- Antagonist concentration $C_{1} = 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$: amplitude $A(C_{1}) = 4.00 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$ and frequency $f(C_{1}) = 0.74 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$.\n- Antagonist concentration $C_{2} = 20 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$: amplitude $A(C_{2}) = 1.00 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$ and frequency $f(C_{2}) = 0.56 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nIndependent pharmacological characterization in this preparation gives $IC_{50} = 10 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$ for this antagonist against the dominant ionotropic glutamate receptor population driving the CPG.\n\nUsing only the assumptions above and these data:\n1.

The solution will be derived by strictly adhering to the provided mathematical models and experimental data.\n\nThe foundational models are given as:\n1. The effective glutamatergic drive, $E(C)$, as a function of antagonist concentration $C$:\n$$ E(C) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{C}{IC_{50}}\\right)^{n}} $$\nwhere $IC_{50}$ is the half-maximal inhibitory concentration and $n$ is the Hill coefficient. At baseline ($C=0$), the drive is maximal, so $E(0) = 1$.\n\n2. The CPG oscillation amplitude, $A(C)$, and frequency, $f(C)$, are dependent on the effective drive:\n$$ A(C) = k_{A} \\, E(C) $$\n$$ f(C) = f_{\\min} + k_{f} \\, E(C) $$\nwhere $k_{A}$, $f_{\\min}$, and $k_{f}$ are positive constants. The baseline values are therefore $A(0) = k_A$ and $f(0) = f_{\\min} + k_f$.\n\nThe first task is to express the fractional reductions in amplitude and frequency in terms of the effective drive $E(C)$. The fractional reduction of a quantity $X(C)$ relative to its baseline value $X(0)$ is defined as $R_X(C) = 1 - \\frac{X(C)}{X(0)}$.\n\nFor the amplitude, the fractional reduction $R_A(C)$ is:\n$$ R_A(C) = 1 - \\frac{A(C)}{A(0)} = 1 - \\frac{k_A E(C)}{k_A} = 1 - E(C) $$\nThis result shows that the fractional reduction in amplitude is identical to the fraction of receptors blocked by the antagonist, $B(C)$.\n\nFor the frequency, the fractional reduction $R_f(C)$ is:\n$$ R_f(C) = 1 - \\frac{f(C)}{f(0)} = 1 - \\frac{f_{\\min} + k_f E(C)}{f_{\\min} + k_f} = \\frac{(f_{\\min} + k_f) - (f_{\\min} + k_f E(C))}{f_{\\min} + k_f} = \\frac{k_f (1 - E(C))}{f(0)} $$\nThe fractional reduction in frequency is thus proportional to $1 - E(C)$.\n\nThe second, and central, task is to determine the value of $n$. We will utilize the frequency-dose data, which is sufficient for this purpose. The model for frequency provides a system of equations based on the measurements:\nAt $C=0$: $f(0) = f_{\\min} + k_f$\nAt $C=C_1$: $f(C_1) = f_{\\min} + k_f E(C_1)$\nAt $C=C_2$: $f(C_2) = f_{\\min} + k_f E(C_2)$\n\nTo eliminate the unknown constants $f_{\\min}$ and $k_f$, we consider the differences from the baseline frequency:\n$$ f(0) - f(C_1) = (f_{\\min} + k_f) - (f_{\\min} + k_f E(C_1)) = k_f (1 - E(C_1)) $$\n$$ f(0) - f(C_2) = (f_{\\min} + k_f) - (f_{\\min} + k_f E(C_2)) = k_f (1 - E(C_2)) $$\nTaking the ratio of these two equations eliminates $k_f$ (as $k_f > 0$ and $C_{1}, C_{2} > 0$ implies $E(C_{1}), E(C_{2}) < 1$):\n$$ \\frac{f(0) - f(C_2)}{f(0) - f(C_1)} = \\frac{k_f (1 - E(C_2))}{k_f (1 - E(C_1))} = \\frac{1 - E(C_2)}{1 - E(C_1)} $$\nWe are given the following frequency data: $f(0) = 0.80 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$, $f(C_1) = 0.74 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$ for $C_1 = 5 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$, and $f(C_2) = 0.56 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$ for $C_2 = 20 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.
