{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "How does an organism initiate a profound, system-wide state of metabolic depression? This transition often resembles a biological switch, a decisive shift from an active to a quiescent state. This practice explores the molecular logic of such a switch by modeling the mutual antagonism between two key cellular regulators: the energy-stress sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the pro-growth kinase mTOR [@problem_id:2582744]. By using a dynamical systems approach with ordinary differential equations, you will investigate how this signaling motif can generate bistability, providing a robust mechanism for the all-or-none entry into torpor.", "problem": "You are asked to formalize and compute a mechanistic dynamical-systems criterion for switch-like entry into torpor via antagonistic signaling between AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR). Begin from the following foundations: (i) the Central Dogma implies that enzyme concentrations and activities can be modeled at coarse-grained level by production and degradation, (ii) mutual inhibition at the level of enzymatic signaling is captured by sigmoidal repression functions when cooperative interactions underlie inhibition, and (iii) ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with Hill-type inhibition approximate such signaling dynamics at steady state. All variables and parameters in this problem are dimensionless.\n\nModel the dynamics of AMPK activity, denoted by $A(t)$, and mTOR activity, denoted by $M(t)$, under an energy-stress input $S \\in [0,1]$, where $S=0$ denotes low stress and $S=1$ denotes high stress. Use the following ODE system:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = k_A \\left( S + (1 - S)\\,\\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{M}{\\theta_M}\\right)^{n}} \\right) - \\gamma_A A,\n\\qquad\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = k_M \\left( (1 - S)\\,\\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{A}{\\theta_A}\\right)^{n}} \\right) - \\gamma_M M.\n$$\nHere $n \\ge 1$ is the Hill coefficient (cooperativity), $k_A$ and $k_M$ are maximal production rates, $\\gamma_A$ and $\\gamma_M$ are first-order degradation rates, and $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_M$ are inhibition thresholds. The Hill repression function is $h(x;\\theta,n) = \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{\\theta}\\right)^n\\right)^{-1}$.\n\nTask. For a given set of parameters $\\{n, k_A, k_M, \\theta_A, \\theta_M, \\gamma_A, \\gamma_M\\}$ and as the energy-stress parameter $S$ varies, the system may exhibit bistability, corresponding to two distinct stable steady states (attractor states): an active state with high $M$ and low $A$, and a depressed state (torpor-like) with high $A$ and low $M$. Your objective is to computationally identify the extent of bistability across a fixed grid of $S$-values. Specifically, for each parameter set, count how many stress levels in the grid\n$$\n\\mathcal{S} = \\{ 0.00, 0.05, 0.10, \\dots, 0.95, 1.00 \\}\n$$\nadmit at least two distinct stable fixed points of the ODE system.\n\nScientific basis and constraints.

Your program must hard-code and evaluate the following parameter sets, each expressed as the tuple $(n, k_A, k_M, \\theta_A, \\theta_M, \\gamma_A, \\gamma_M)$:\n- Case $1$ (symmetric, strongly cooperative): $(4, 3.0, 3.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0)$.\n- Case $2$ (weak cooperativity): $(1, 3.0, 3.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0)$.\n- Case $3$ (asymmetric thresholds and degradation): $(3, 2.0, 2.0, 0.3, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2)$.\n- Case $4$ (strong production and cooperativity): $(5, 5.0, 4.0, 0.4, 0.4, 1.0, 1.0)$.\n\nOutput specification. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, e.g., $[r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4]$, where $r_i$ is the integer number of $S$-values in $\\mathcal{S}$ with at least two distinct stable equilibria for Case $i$. No spaces are permitted in the output line. All variables and parameters are dimensionless, so no physical units are required. Angles are not used. Percentages must be treated as decimals; the specified grid $\\mathcal{S}$ already uses decimal representation.", "solution": "The problem presents a valid and well-defined task in computational systems biology. It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of modeling biochemical networks, specifically the use of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with Hill-type kinetics to represent mutual inhibition in signaling pathways like the one involving AMPK and mTOR. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary equations, parameters, and a clear, objective procedure for finding the solution. It is free from ambiguity, factual errors, and non-scientific claims. Therefore, a reasoned solution can be constructed.\n\nThe objective is to determine the extent of bistability in a model of metabolic regulation for several parameter sets. Bistability, the existence of two distinct stable steady states for a given set of external conditions, is a key mechanism for generating switch-like cellular responses. Here, the external condition is the energy-stress parameter $S$. A high count of $S$-values that support bistability indicates a robust switching mechanism.\n\nThe solution strategy follows the prescribed computational method. For each of the four parameter cases, we iterate through every stress level $S$ in the grid $\\mathcal{S} = \\{ 0.00, 0.05, \\dots, 1.00 \\}$. At each $S$, we must find the number of distinct, stable fixed points of the given ODE system:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = k_A \\left( S + (1 - S)\\,\\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{M}{\\theta_M}\\right)^{n}} \\right) - \\gamma_A A\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = k_M \\left( (1 - S)\\,\\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{A}{\\theta_A}\\right)^{n}} \\right) - \\gamma_M M\n$$\nThe number of $S$-values for which at least two such stable fixed points exist is then tallied.\n\nThe process for identifying stable fixed points for a specific $S$ and parameter set is threefold:\n\n1.  **Existence Search via Numerical Integration**: The attractors (including stable fixed points) of the dynamical system are found by simulating the system's evolution from a wide range of initial conditions. A grid of initial points $(A(0), M(0))$ is created within a bounding box defined by the production-to-degradation ratios, for instance, $A \\in [0, 1.5 k_A / \\gamma_A]$ and $M \\in [0, 1.5 k_M / \\gamma_M]$. From each initial point, the ODE system is numerically integrated for a sufficiently long duration (e.g., $t \\in [0, 100]$, which is much larger than the characteristic degradation timescales $1/\\gamma_A$ and $1/\\gamma_M$) to allow the system to settle into a steady state. The state of the system at the final time point $(A_{final}, M_{final})$ is a candidate fixed point.\n\n2.  **Clustering of Candidate Fixed Points**: The set of final states obtained from all integrations is processed to identify unique candidates. This is done by clustering. An iterative approach is used: a list of unique fixed points is maintained. For each new candidate point, its Euclidean distance to every point already in the unique list is calculated. If the distance is smaller than a specified tolerance of $10^{-4}$ for all points in the list, it is considered a duplicate and discarded. Otherwise, it is added to the list of unique fixed points.\n\n3.  **Stability Analysis via the Jacobian Matrix**: Each unique candidate fixed point $(A^\\ast, M^\\ast)$ is then tested for linear stability. A fixed point is stable if small perturbations away from it decay over time. This condition is equivalent to requiring that all eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $J$, evaluated at the fixed point, have negative real parts. The Jacobian matrix is the matrix of first-order partial derivatives of the system's rate equations:\n$$\nJ(A^\\ast,M^\\ast;S) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A}\\left(\\frac{dA}{dt}\\right) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial M}\\left(\\frac{dA}{dt}\\right) \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A}\\left(\\frac{dM}{dt}\\right) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial M}\\left(\\frac{dM}{dt}\\right)\n\\end{pmatrix}\\Bigg|_{(A^\\ast,M^\\ast)}\n$$\nFor the given system, the components of the Jacobian are:\n$$\nJ =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\gamma_A & k_A(1-S)\\,\\frac{d}{dM}h(M;\\theta_M,n)\\big|_{M^\\ast} \\\\\nk_M(1-S)\\,\\frac{d}{dA}h(A;\\theta_A,n)\\big|_{A^\\ast} & -\\gamma_M\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $h(x;\\theta,n) = (1 + (x/\\theta)^n)^{-1}$ is the Hill repression function. The required derivative is explicitly given as:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}h(x;\\theta,n) = -\\frac{n}{\\theta}\\,\\frac{\\left(\\frac{x}{\\theta}\\right)^{n-1}}{\\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{\\theta}\\right)^{n}\\right)^{2}}\n$$\nWe compute the eigenvalues of this $2 \\times 2$ matrix for each $(A^\\ast, M^\\ast)$ and count the number of points for which all eigenvalue real parts are negative.\n\nIf this count of stable fixed points is two or more, the system is considered bistable for that value of $S$. The final answer for each parameter case is the total number of $S$-values in the grid $\\mathcal{S}$ that exhibit this bistability.
