We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the depletion of the body's usable oxygen store during apnea is the conservation of mass. Let $V_{O_2}(t)$ denote the volume of usable oxygen at time $t$. The rate of change of this volume, $\\frac{dV_{O_2}(t)}{dt}$, is the difference between the rate of oxygen inflow and the rate of oxygen outflow.\n$$\n\\frac{d V_{O_2}(t)}{dt} = \\text{Rate}_{\\text{in}} - \\text{Rate}_{\\text{out}}\n$$\nDuring apnea, there is no external oxygen supply, so $\\text{Rate}_{\\text{in}} = 0$. The outflow is due to metabolic consumption, which is the metabolic oxygen consumption rate, $\\dot{V}O_2$. The problem states that $\\dot{V}O_2$ is constant within each scenario.
