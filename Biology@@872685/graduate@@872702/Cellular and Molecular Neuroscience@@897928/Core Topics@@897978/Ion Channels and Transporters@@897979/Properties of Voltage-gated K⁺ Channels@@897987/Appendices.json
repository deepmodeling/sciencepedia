We begin with the givens.\n\nA single channel, when open, follows Ohm's law. Its current $i_{\\mathrm{open}}$ is proportional to the electrochemical driving force $(V-E_{K})$:\n$$\ni_{\\mathrm{open}} = \\gamma (V - E_{K})\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the single-channel conductance, $V$ is the membrane potential, and $E_{K}$ is the Nernst potential for potassium.\n\nChannels are stochastic entities, switching between a closed state (current is $0$) and an open state (current is $i_{\\mathrm{open}}$). Let us define a stochastic variable $s_j(t)$ for the $j$-th channel, such that $s_j=1$ if the channel is open and $s_j=0$ if it is closed. The current through the $j$-th channel is then $i_j = s_j \\cdot i_{\\mathrm{open}}$.\n\nThe total current $I$ across a membrane patch containing $N$ identical channels is the sum of the individual channel currents:\n$$\nI = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} i_j = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} s_j \\gamma (V - E_{K})\n$$\nSince $\\gamma$, $V$, and $E_{K}$ are constant for all channels at a given membrane potential, we can write:\n$$\nI = \\gamma (V - E_{K}) \\sum_{j=1}^{N} s_j\n$$\nThe macroscopic current is defined as the ensemble average of this total current, denoted by $\\langle I \\rangle$.

It describes a classic problem in ion channel biophysics.\n\nThe objective is to measure the voltage-dependent open probability, $P_{\\mathrm{open}}(V)$, for a potassium channel that exhibits fast activation and slower inactivation. The governing equation for the macroscopic potassium current, $I_{\\mathrm{K}}$, is given as:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{K}}(t,V) = g_{\\max}\\,P_{\\mathrm{open}}(t,V)\\,\\big(V - E_{\\mathrm{K}}\\big)$$\nwhere $g_{\\max}$ is the maximum conductance, $P_{\\mathrm{open}}(t,V)$ is the time- and voltage-dependent open probability, $V$ is the membrane potential, and $E_{\\mathrmK}$ is the potassium reversal potential.\n\nThe problem is to determine $P_{\\mathrm{open}}(V)$, which represents the steady-state activation probability at voltage $V$, isolated from the process of inactivation. The provided time constants at depolarized potentials, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}} \\approx 1\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{inact}} \\approx 50\\ \\mathrm{ms}$, are crucial. The separation of timescales ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}} \\ll \\tau_{\\mathrm{inact}}$) allows for a voltage-clamp protocol that separates these two processes.\n\nThe standard method to achieve this is a tail-current protocol. The principle is as follows:\n1.  The cell is held at a very negative potential ($V_{\\mathrm{hold}}$), where channels are closed and any pre-existing inactivation is removed.\n2.  A voltage-clamp \"pre-pulse\" to a test voltage $V_{\\mathrm{pre}}$ is applied for a duration $T$. During this pulse, channels activate. To isolate activation from inactivation, $T$ must be chosen such that activation is nearly complete, but inactivation has not significantly started. This requires a pulse duration $T$ such that $\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}(V_{\\mathrm{pre}}) \\ll T \\ll \\tau_{\\mathrm{inact}}(V_{\\mathrm{pre}})$. Given the time constants, a duration of $T \\approx 5-10\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ would be appropriate.\n3.  Immediately following the pre-pulse, the voltage is stepped to a fixed \"tail\" voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{tail}}$. Because channel gating is not instantaneous, the fraction of channels open at the very beginning of the tail pulse (time $t=0^{+}$) is the same as the fraction open at the end of the pre-pulse, $P_{\\mathrm{open}}(T, V_{\\mathrm{pre}})$.\n4.  The initial tail current, $I_{\\mathrm{tail}}(0^{+})$, is measured. This current is given by:\n    $$I_{\\mathrm{tail}}(0^{+}; V_{\\mathrm{pre}}) = g_{\\max}\\,P_{\\mathrm{open}}(T, V_{\\mathrm{pre}})\\,\\big(V_{\\mathrm{tail}} - E_{\\mathrm{K}}\\big)$$\n5.  Since $g_{\\max}$, $V_{\\mathrm{tail}}$, and $E_{\\mathrmK}$ are constant for all measurements in the series, the initial tail current is directly proportional to the open probability at the end of the pre-pulse: $I_{\\mathrm{tail}}(0^{+}; V_{\\mathrm{pre}}) \\propto P_{\\mathrm{open}}(T, V_{\\mathrm{pre}})$. With the properly chosen duration $T$, this is a very good approximation of the desired steady-state activation, $P_{\\mathrm{open}}(V_{\\mathrm{pre}})$.\n6.  The full activation curve, $P_{\\mathrm{open}}(V_{\\mathrm{pre}})$, is obtained by normalizing the measured tail currents to the maximum tail current, which is observed at a $V_{\\mathrm{pre}}$ that is sufficiently depolarized to cause maximal channel opening ($P_{\\mathrm{open}} \\approx 1$).\n    $$P_{\\mathrm{open}}(V_{\\mathrm{pre}}) = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{tail}}(0^{+}; V_{\\mathrm{pre}})}{\\max_{V_{\\mathrm{pre}}}\\{I_{\\mathrm{tail}}(0^{+}; V_{\\mathrm{pre}})\\}}$$\n7.

This directly contravenes the goal of avoiding interference from inactivation.\n- Justification: The reasoning that \"Because inactivation is at steady state, the initial tail current ... reflects $P_{\\mathrm{open}}(V_{\\mathrmpre}})$ without contamination\" is fallacious. Reaching steady-state inactivation means the measurement is maximally *contaminated* by inactivation.\n- Leak Subtraction: The proposal to use \"depolarizing pulses\" for a $p/n$ protocol is non-standard and risky, as such pulses could themselves activate the K⁺ channels, violating the assumptions of the method.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD.

For physiological potassium concentrations, $E_{\\mathrmK}$ is very negative (e.g., $-80\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ to $-90\\ \\mathrm{mV}$), so the driving force at $0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ would be large, not near zero. This would create a large outward current, not a minimal one. If conditions were manipulated to make $E_{\\mathrmK} \\approx 0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$, the signal-to-noise ratio would be abysmal, making measurements unreliable.\n- Leak Subtraction: Claiming leak subtraction is unnecessary is incorrect. Leak current is generally non-zero at $0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ and must be subtracted.\n- Analysis: Using the deactivation time constant, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}$, as a proxy for $P_{\\mathrm{open}}(V_{\\mathrm{pre}})$ is biophysically nonsensical. $\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}$ describes the *rate* of channel closing at $V_{\\mathrm{tail}}$ and is independent of the *number* of channels that were open.

This is given by the allosteric model as $L_n = L_0 D^n$, where $L_n$ is the opening equilibrium constant ($[O_n]/[C_n]$) when $n$ sensors are active, $L_0$ is this constant when all sensors are resting ($n=0$), and $D$ is the voltage-independent coupling factor.\n\nWe proceed by determining the statistical weight of each possible state of the channel relative to the reference state, which we define as the channel being closed with all sensors in the resting state ($C_0$). The weight of this state, $W(C_0)$, is set to $1$.\n\nFor a state with $n$ activated sensors, there are $\\binom{N}{n}$ ways to choose which sensors are activated. The statistical weight of the channel being closed with $n$ sensors activated, $W(C_n)$, is therefore:\n$$ W(C_n) = \\binom{N}{n} [K(V)]^n $$\nThe statistical weight of the channel being open with $n$ sensors activated, $W(O_n)$, is related to $W(C_n)$ by the opening equilibrium constant $L_n$:\n$$ W(O_n) = W(C_n) \\cdot L_n = \\binom{N}{n} [K(V)]^n (L_0 D^n) = \\binom{N}{n} L_0 [K(V)D]^n $$\n\nThe overall probability of the channel being open, $P_{\\text{open}}(V)$, is the sum of the weights of all open states divided by the sum of the weights of all possible states (closed and open).\n$$ P_{\\text{open}}(V) = \\frac{\\sum_{n=0}^{N} W(O_n)}{\\sum_{n=0}^{N} W(C_n) + \\sum_{n=0}^{N} W(O_n)} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the weights:\n$$ P_{\\text{open}}(V) = \\frac{\\sum_{n=0}^{N} \\binom{N}{n} L_0 [K(V)D]^n}{\\sum_{n=0}^{N} \\binom{N}{n} [K(V)]^n + \\sum_{n=0}^{N} \\binom{N}{n} L_0 [K(V)D]^n} $$\nUsing the binomial theorem, $\\sum_{k=0}^{m} \\binom{m}{k} x^k = (1+x)^m$, we can simplify the sums:\n$$ \\sum_{n=0}^{N} \\binom{N}{n} [K(V)]^n = (1 + K(V))^N $$\n$$ \\sum_{n=0}^{N} \\binom{N}{n} L_0 [K(V)D]^n = L_0 \\sum_{n=0}^{N} \\binom{N}{n} [K(V)D]^n = L_0 (1 + K(V)D)^N $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P_{\\text{open}}(V)$ yields the MWC equation for open probability:\n$$ P_{\\text{open}}(V) = \\frac{L_0 (1 + K(V)D)^N}{(1 + K(V))^N + L_0 (1 + K(V)D)^N} $$\n\nThe problem states that the midpoint of the open probability-voltage relation is $V_P$, which means by definition $P_{\\text{open}}(V_P) = 1/2$. At this voltage, the two terms in the denominator must be equal:\n$$ (1 + K(V_P))^N = L_0 (1 + K(V_P)D)^N $$\nWe can now solve for the coupling factor $D$. Taking the $N$-th root of both sides:\n$$ 1 + K(V_P) = L_0^{1/N} (1 + K(V_P)D) $$\nRearranging to isolate $D$:\n$$ L_0^{1/N} + L_0^{1/N} K(V_P) D = 1 + K(V_P) $$\n$$ L_0^{1/N} K(V_P) D = 1 + K(V_P) - L_0^{1/N} $$\nThis gives the minimal expression linking the parameters to $D$:\n$$ D = \\frac{1 + K(V_P) - L_0^{1/N}}{L_0^{1/N} K(V_P)} $$\nwhere $K(V_P) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{z_{s} e (V_P - V_{Q})}{k_{B}T}\\right)$.\n\nTo compute the numerical value of $D$, we use the provided parameters:\n$V_{Q}=-35\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $V_{P}=-20\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $z_{s}=3.0$, $N=4$, $L_{0}=1.0\\times 10^{-7}$, and $T=298\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nFirst, we calculate the thermal voltage, $V_T = k_{B}T/e$:\n$$ V_T = \\frac{(1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K})(298\\,\\mathrm{K})}{1.6022 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.02569\\,\\mathrm{V} = 25.69\\,\\mathrm{mV} $$\nNext, we determine the value of the sensor equilibrium constant at $V_P$:\n$$ K(V_P) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{z_{s} (V_P - V_{Q})}{V_T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{3.0 \\cdot (-20\\,\\mathrm{mV} - (-35\\,\\mathrm{mV}))}{25.69\\,\\mathrm{mV}}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{45}{25.69}\\right) \\approx \\exp(1.7517) \\approx 5.764 $$\nNow, we compute the term involving $L_0$:\n$$ L_0^{1/N} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-7})^{1/4} = (10^{-7})^{0.25} \\approx 0.01778 $$\nFinally, we substitute these values into our expression for $D$:\n$$ D = \\frac{1 + 5.764 - 0.01778}{(0.01778)(5.764)} = \\frac{6.74622}{0.10248} \\approx 65.83 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we obtain $D \\approx 65.8$. A value of $D \\gg 1$ signifies strong coupling, meaning that the activation of each voltage sensor substantially promotes the opening of the channel pore.\n\nRegarding the relationship between $V_Q$ and $V_P$: the midpoint of sensor activation (charge movement) is $V_Q=-35\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, while the midpoint of pore opening is $V_P=-20\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The fact that $V_Q  V_P$ demonstrates that sensor activation occurs at more negative potentials than pore opening. At $-35\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, half of the gating charge has moved, but the channel open probability is far below $1/2$. The channel requires further depolarization to $-20\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ for the open probability to reach $1/2$. This temporal and voltage separation is a direct consequence of the allosteric mechanism, where sensor movement is a prerequisite for, and precedes, the final conformational change of pore opening.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{65.8}$$", "id": "2741791"}]}
