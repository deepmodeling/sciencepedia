It describes a canonical problem in the biophysics of ion channels, specifically the basis of divalent versus monovalent cation selectivity. The provided foundational facts are correct representations of established principles (Eisenman-Hille model of ion selectivity). Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem asks to predict the effect of a glutamate-to-alanine (E→A) mutation in the selectivity filter of a $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$-permeable TRP channel on the permeability ratio $P_{\\mathrm{Ca}}/P_{\\mathrm{Na}}$. The solution must be based on the provided principles of electrostatics, dehydration energetics, and field strength.\n\n**1. Initial State: The Wild-Type Channel**\n\nThe wild-type channel's selectivity filter contains a ring of acidic residues, specifically glutamate (E). At physiological pH, the carboxylate side chain of glutamate ($-\\text{COO}^-$) is negatively charged. This concentration of negative charges creates a region of strong negative electrostatic potential, known as a 'high-field-strength' site.\n\n**2. Energetics of Ion Permeation and Selectivity**\n\nFor an ion to pass through the narrow selectivity filter, it must shed some or all of its surrounding water molecules (its hydration shell). This process requires energy, the dehydration energy ($\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{dehyd}}$). As stated, the magnitude of the hydration free energy is larger for $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ than for $\\text{Na}^{+}$: $|\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hyd}}|_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}} > |\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hyd}}|_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}}$. Thus, the energetic cost of dehydration is significantly higher for $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$.\n\nTo compensate for this dehydration energy cost, the permeating ion interacts with the charged residues of the selectivity filter. This provides an electrostatic stabilization energy, $U_{\\text{site}}$. The problem states that this energy is proportional to the ion's valence, $z$: $U_{\\text{site}} \\propto -z e \\phi$, where $\\phi$ is the local electrostatic potential created by the filter. For $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$, $z=2$, and for $\\text{Na}^{+}$, $z=1$.\n\nSelectivity arises from the balance between the dehydration energy cost and the stabilization energy gain. An ion is preferred (more permeable) if the net free energy barrier for its transit is lower. The channel is $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$-selective because the high-field-strength site (large negative $\\phi$) provides a very large stabilization energy for the divalent $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ ion ($U_{\\text{site}, \\text{Ca}^{2+}}$ is large and negative), which is sufficient to overcome its large dehydration energy cost. For the monovalent $\\text{Na}^{+}$ ion, both the dehydration cost and the stabilization energy are smaller. In a high-field-strength site, the energetic balance favors $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$, leading to a permeability ratio $P_{\\mathrm{Ca}}/P_{\\mathrm{Na}} > 1$. This aligns with the provided fact that high-field-strength sites favor ions of higher charge density like $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$.\n\n**3. The Effect of the E→A Mutation**\n\nThe mutation replaces glutamate (E), with its negatively charged carboxylate side chain ($-\\text{COO}^-$), with alanine (A), which has a small, neutral methyl side chain ($-\\text{CH}_3$).\n\nThe primary consequence of this substitution is the removal of a negative charge from the selectivity filter. This reduces the total negative charge density in the pore lining, thereby making the electrostatic potential $\\phi$ less negative. In other words, the mutation converts the high-field-strength site into a lower-field-strength site.\n\n**4. Predicting the Change in Permeability Ratio**\n\nWe must now analyze how this change in field strength affects the relative permeabilities of $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\\text{Na}^{+}$.\n\n- With a lower field strength (smaller $|\\phi|$), the stabilization energy, $|U_{\\text{site}}|$, is reduced for both ions.\n- However, this reduction is not equal. The loss of stabilization for $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ is approximately twice the loss for $\\text{Na}^{+}$, because the interaction energy is proportional to the valence $z$.\n- $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ relies critically on the large stabilization energy from the high-field-strength site to offset its very large dehydration energy. When this stabilization is significantly weakened, the high dehydration cost becomes prohibitive.\n- $\\text{Na}^{+}$, with its much smaller dehydration energy, is less affected by the reduction in stabilization energy.\n- Consequently, the net energy barrier for $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ permeation increases more dramatically than the barrier for $\\text{Na}^{+}$ permeation.\n- This shifts the selectivity preference away from the ion with the higher dehydration energy ($\\text{Ca}^{2+}$) and towards the ion with the lower dehydration energy ($\\text{Na}^{+}$). This is precisely what the Eisenman sequence concept predicts: lowering the field strength shifts preference toward more weakly hydrated (and often larger, monovalent) cations.\n\nTherefore, the permeability of $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ relative to $\\text{Na}^{+}$ will decrease. The ratio $P_{\\mathrm{Ca}}/P_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ will decrease.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. $P_{\\mathrm{Ca}}/P_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ decreases, because removing a carboxylate lowers the local negative charge and field strength at the filter, reducing preferential stabilization of $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ over $\\text{Na}^{+}$ and shifting toward a lower-field Eisenman regime that favors monovalent cations.**\nThis statement correctly identifies that the E→A mutation removes a charge, lowering the field strength. It correctly deduces that this reduces the preferential stabilization of $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ (which is more sensitive to field strength due to its $z=2$ charge and high dehydration energy). It correctly concludes this leads to a shift in preference towards monovalent cations, causing $P_{\\mathrm{Ca}}/P_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ to decrease. This entire line of reasoning is consistent with the provided principles. **Correct**.\n\n**B. $P_{\\mathrm{Ca}}/P_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ increases, because substituting alanine widens the pore, reducing steric hindrance for $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ relative to $\\text{Na}^{+}$ and thereby enhancing divalent selectivity.**\nThis option incorrectly focuses on steric hindrance as the primary mechanism of selectivity. While the pore may widen, selectivity between $\\text{Na}^{+}$ and $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ is dominated by the interplay of electrostatics and dehydration, not simple size sieving, as their crystal radii are similar. More importantly, this option completely ignores the dominant electrostatic effect of removing a negative charge, which is the central feature of the mutation. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $P_{\\mathrm{Ca}}/P_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ is unchanged, because both $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\\text{Na}^{+}$ lose the same electrostatic interaction with the removed negative charge, so their relative permeabilities are unaffected.**\nThis statement is founded on a false premise. The electrostatic interaction energy is proportional to the ionic valence $z$, as given by $U \\propto -z e \\phi$. Since $z_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}} = 2$ and $z_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}} = 1$, the interactions are not the same. $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ interacts approximately twice as strongly with the filter's charge as $\\text{Na}^{+}$ does. Therefore, removing a charge will affect the two ions differentially, leading to a change in the permeability ratio. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $P_{\\mathrm{Ca}}/P_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ increases, because reducing negative fixed charge weakens $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ binding and prevents trapping, increasing $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ throughput more than $\\text{Na}^{+}$, consistent with high-field Eisenman preferences.**\nThis option contains a fundamental contradiction. While it is true that reducing the negative charge weakens $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ binding, it incorrectly concludes this increases $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ selectivity. The argument about preventing \"trapping\" might apply in some regimes, but the conclusion is inconsistent with the principles provided. The mutation moves the site *away from* a high-field regime. A high-field preference is what favors $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$; moving to a lower-field regime must therefore reduce this preference.

The concepts presented—unitary current, reversal potential, channel gating, bursting kinetics, and Markov models—are fundamental and correctly defined. The experimental setup (inside-out patch clamp) is appropriate for applying a lipid agonist to the intracellular side of the channel. The observations are internally consistent and represent a plausible scenario for the allosteric modulation of an ion channel. The question asks for the most parsimonious explanation of these observations in terms of permeation versus gating, which is a standard biophysical question. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no apparent flaws.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Analysis of Observations\n\nThe problem is to distinguish between effects on permeation and effects on gating. These two aspects of channel function are, to a first approximation, separable.\n\n1.  **Permeation Properties**: Permeation is governed by the single-channel conductance, $\\gamma$, and the ionic selectivity, which determines the reversal potential, $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$. The problem provides the fundamental relation $i = \\gamma (V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$. The experiment is conducted at a fixed membrane potential $V$.\n    - Observation 1 states that the unitary current amplitude $i$ is unchanged.\n    - Observation 2 states that the reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ is unchanged.\n    - Given that $V$, $i$, and $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ are all constant, the single-channel conductance $\\gamma$ must also be constant.\n    - Since both $\\gamma$ and $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ are unchanged, we must conclude that the lipid agonist does **not** modify the permeation properties of the channel's open pore.\n\n2.  **Gating Properties**: Gating refers to the conformational transitions between the channel's open and closed states. The observations related to gating are:\n    - (3) Unchanged dwell-time distributions for within-burst fast gating.\n    - (4) Increased mean burst duration.\n    - (5) More openings per burst.\n    - (6) Decreased frequency of long closed intervals.\n\n    These observations can be interpreted using a kinetic model that includes bursting. A minimal model for bursting involves at least three states, often configured as:\n    $$ C_{s} \\ \\underset{k_{sb}}{\\overset{k_{bs}}{\\rightleftarrows}} \\ [C_{f} \\ \\underset{k_{oc}}{\\overset{k_{co}}{\\rightleftarrows}} \\ O] $$\n    Here, $O$ is the open state, $C_f$ is a short-lived (\"flickery\") closed state, and $C_s$ is a long-lived (\"silent\") closed state. A \"burst\" is defined as a period during which the channel transitions rapidly between the states in the square brackets, which form the bursting aggregate $B = \\{C_f, O\\}$, before entering the long-lived silent state $C_s$.\n\n    - The mean duration of a burst, $\\langle T_b \\rangle$, is the average time the channel spends in the aggregate state $B$ before exiting to $C_s$. In this simple model, this is primarily determined by the rate constant $k_{bs}$ such that $\\langle T_b \\rangle \\approx 1/k_{bs}$. Observation (4), that the mean burst duration increases, implies that the rate of leaving the bursting mode, $k_{bs}$, must **decrease**.\n    - Observation (6), that long closed intervals between bursts decrease in frequency, means the channel spends less time, on average, in the silent state $C_s$. The mean duration of the silent state is $1/k_{sb}$. A decrease in the duration or frequency of these silent periods implies that the rate of exit from this state, $k_{sb}$, must **increase**.\n    - The combined effect of a decrease in $k_{bs}$ and an increase in $k_{sb}$ is a shift in the gating equilibrium $C_s \\leftrightarrow B$ towards the bursting aggregate $B$. The lipid agonist stabilizes the bursting mode of the channel relative to the long-lived closed state.\n    - Observation (3), that within-burst dwell times are unchanged, implies that the rates governing the fast flickering within the burst, $k_{co}$ and $k_{oc}$, are not affected by the lipid.\n    - Observation (5), more openings per burst, is a direct consequence of the longer burst duration. If the channel stays in the bursting aggregate $B$ for a longer time and the flickering rates within $B$ are unchanged, it will naturally have more opportunities to visit the open state $O$ before the burst terminates.\n\n    **Conclusion**: The lipid agonist is a gating modulator. It specifically alters the rates of transition between long-lived closed states and the bursting aggregate of states, thereby stabilizing the active, bursting conformation of the channel. It does not affect permeation.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The lipid primarily stabilizes the bursting aggregate by shifting gating equilibria without altering permeation. A minimal kinetic scheme is...**\nThis option's primary assertion is that the lipid modifies gating, not permeation. This aligns perfectly with the conclusion from the unchanged $i$ and $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$. The proposed kinetic scheme is appropriate for describing bursting. The explanation that the lipid reduces $k_{bs}$ and/or increases $k_{sb}$ correctly accounts for the increased mean burst duration ($\\langle T_b \\rangle \\approx 1/k_{bs}$) and the increased frequency of bursts (or decreased duration of silent periods, governed by $1/k_{sb}$). The reasoning provided is entirely consistent with all experimental data and fundamental biophysical principles.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The lipid primarily increases permeation by raising the single-channel conductance $\\gamma$, but the apparent unitary current amplitude $i$ remains unchanged because the open probability increases and compensates for the conductance change under voltage clamp.**\nThis option claims the primary effect is on permeation ($\\gamma$ increases). This is in direct contradiction to the observation that the unitary current amplitude $i$ is unchanged. In a single-channel recording, $i$ is the measured current flowing through one open channel. If $\\gamma$ were to increase, $i$ would necessarily increase since $i = \\gamma (V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$ and $V$ and $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ are fixed. The proposed \"compensation\" by open probability is nonsensical for unitary current amplitude; open probability affects the macroscopic average current, not the amplitude of a single channel's current step.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The lipid introduces a new high-conductance open state that increases the time spent in the open conformation, thereby lengthening bursts. A compatible scheme is...**\nThis option proposes a mechanism involving a new open state $O_2$ with a higher conductance, $\\gamma_2 > \\gamma_1$. If the channel were to populate this state, single-channel recordings would show a second, larger current level corresponding to $\\gamma_2$. The problem explicitly states that the unitary current amplitude $i$ is *unchanged*. This observation directly refutes the existence of a populated higher-conductance state.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The lipid alters ion selectivity within the pore, changing the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz (GHK) weighted permeability ratio and thus $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$, which secondarily stabilizes bursting by modifying the driving force.**\nThis option claims the lipid alters ion selectivity, which would manifest as a change in the reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$. This is in direct contradiction to observation (2), which states that $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ is unchanged.

It is well-posed, leading to a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n\nThe analysis will proceed in four parts as requested: derivation, computation of thermodynamic parameters, qualitative reasoning, and determination of the equilibrium temperature.\n\nFirst, we derive the relationship between the van't Hoff plot parameters and the standard enthalpy change, $\\Delta H^\\circ$, and standard entropy change, $\\Delta S^\\circ$. The analysis begins with two fundamental thermodynamic relationships. The first connects the standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^\\circ$, to $\\Delta H^\\circ$ and $\\Delta S^\\circ$ at a given absolute temperature $T$:\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ = \\Delta H^\\circ - T\\Delta S^\\circ\n$$\nThe second relates $\\Delta G^\\circ$ to the equilibrium constant, $K$, for the reaction:\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ = -RT \\ln K\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant.\n\nBy equating these two expressions for $\\Delta G^\\circ$, we obtain:\n$$\n-RT \\ln K = \\Delta H^\\circ - T\\Delta S^\\circ\n$$\nTo obtain the form of the van't Hoff equation, we rearrange this expression to solve for $\\ln K$:\n$$\n\\ln K = -\\frac{\\Delta H^\\circ}{RT} + \\frac{T\\Delta S^\\circ}{RT}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\ln K = \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H^\\circ}{R}\\right)\\frac{1}{T} + \\frac{\\Delta S^\\circ}{R}\n$$\nThis equation is linear in the form $y = mx + c$, where $y = \\ln K$ and $x = 1/T$.

The closing reaction has a positive enthalpy change ($\\Delta H^\\circ > 0$), indicating it is an endothermic process that requires an input of heat. The closing reaction also has a positive entropy change ($\\Delta S^\\circ > 0$), suggesting an increase in the overall disorder of the system (channel plus solvent) upon closing. The spontaneity of the closing reaction is determined by $\\Delta G^\\circ = \\Delta H^\\circ - T\\Delta S^\\circ$. The positive $\\Delta H^\\circ$ opposes closing, while the positive $\\Delta S^\\circ$ favors it through the $-T\\Delta S^\\circ$ term. When cooling the system, the temperature $T$ decreases. This diminishes the magnitude of the favorable entropic term, $-T\\Delta S^\\circ$. Consequently, $\\Delta G^\\circ$ for closing becomes more positive, making the closing reaction less spontaneous. This implies that the reverse reaction, opening, becomes more favorable. Thus, cooling shifts the equilibrium towards the open state, increasing the open probability of the channel. This is consistent with the biological function of TRPM8 as a cold-activated sensor.\n\nFourth, we determine the temperature $T^{\\ast}$ at which $K = 1$. This condition corresponds to an equal population of open and closed states. At this temperature, the standard Gibbs free energy change is zero, since $\\Delta G^\\circ = -RT^{\\ast}\\ln(K) = -RT^{\\ast}\\ln(1) = 0$. Using the linear equation for the van't Hoff plot derived and parameterized above:\n$$\n\\ln K = -\\frac{5000}{T} + 12\n$$\nWe set $\\ln K = 0$ and solve for $T=T^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{5000\\,\\mathrm{K}}{T^{\\ast}} + 12\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{5000\\,\\mathrm{K}}{T^{\\ast}} = 12\n$$\n$$\nT^{\\ast} = \\frac{5000}{12}\\,\\mathrm{K} = 416.666... \\,\\mathrm{K}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nT^{\\ast} = 416.7\\,\\mathrm{K}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{416.7}\n$$", "id": "2769243"}]}
