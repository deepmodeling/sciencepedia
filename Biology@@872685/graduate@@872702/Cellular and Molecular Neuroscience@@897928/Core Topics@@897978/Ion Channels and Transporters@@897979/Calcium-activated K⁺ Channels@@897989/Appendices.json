First, we must derive the expression for single-channel current and compute its value. Second, we must provide a conceptual explanation of series resistance artifact.\n\nPart 1: Derivation and Calculation of Single-Channel Current\n\nWe begin with the fundamental definitions provided. Ohm's law for a linear resistor states that the voltage drop ($V_{\\text{drop}}$) across a resistor is proportional to the current ($I$) flowing through it and its resistance ($R$):\n$$V_{\\text{drop}} = I \\cdot R$$\nElectrical conductance ($g$) is defined as the reciprocal of resistance:\n$$g = \\frac{1}{R}$$\nBy substituting $R = 1/g$ into Ohm's law, we can express the current in terms of conductance and voltage drop:\n$$V_{\\text{drop}} = I \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{g}\\right)$$\n$$I = g \\cdot V_{\\text{drop}}$$\nThe problem specifies that the ion channel acts as a selective pathway, and the effective voltage drop driving the ionic current is the difference between the membrane potential ($V$) and the ion's reversal potential, in this case, the potassium reversal potential ($E_K$). This potential difference is the electrochemical driving force.\n$$V_{\\text{drop}} = V - E_K$$\nSubstituting this expression for the driving force into our equation for the current, and using the conventional symbol $i$ for a single-channel current and $g$ for single-channel conductance, we arrive at the general expression for the single-channel current:\n$$i = g(V - E_K)$$\nThis is the required general expression, often referred to as the microscopic Ohm's law for an ion channel.\n\nNext, we must evaluate this current for the given parameters:\nSingle-channel conductance, $g = 250 \\text{ pS}$\nMembrane potential, $V = +40 \\text{ mV}$\nPotassium reversal potential, $E_K = -90 \\text{ mV}$\n\nTo ensure dimensional consistency, we must convert all values to base SI units (Siemens, Volts, Amperes).\n$$g = 250 \\text{ pS} = 250 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ S}$$\n$$V = +40 \\text{ mV} = 40 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}$$\n$$E_K = -90 \\text{ mV} = -90 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}$$\n\nFirst, calculate the driving force, $V - E_K$:\n$$V - E_K = (40 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}) - (-90 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}) = (40 + 90) \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V} = 130 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}$$\nNow, calculate the current, $i$:\n$$i = g(V - E_K) = (250 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ S}) \\cdot (130 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V})$$\n$$i = (250 \\cdot 130) \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ A}$$\n$$i = 32500 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ A} = 32.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ A}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in picoamperes (pA), where $1 \\text{ pA} = 10^{-12} \\text{ A}$.\n$$i = 32.5 \\text{ pA}$$\nThe value $32.5$ has three significant figures, which satisfies the rounding requirement.\n\nPart 2: Explanation of Series Resistance Bias\n\nAn ideal voltage-clamp experiment assumes that the command voltage ($V_{\\text{cmd}}$) set by the experimenter is identical to the true membrane potential ($V_m$). However, any real experimental setup has a non-zero access or series resistance, $R_s$, between the voltage-clamp amplifier and the cell membrane. This resistance is in series with the membrane resistance (or, for a single channel, the channel resistance $R_{ch} = 1/g$).\n\nWhen an ionic current, $I$, flows across the membrane, it must also flow through this series resistance. This creates a voltage drop across $R_s$ equal to $I \\cdot R_s$. Consequently, the true membrane potential, $V_m$, is not equal to the command voltage. The relationship is given by:\n$$V_m = V_{\\text{cmd}} - I \\cdot R_s$$\nThe term $I \\cdot R_s$ represents the voltage-clamp error.\n\nAn experimenter who naively assumes $V_m = V_{\\text{cmd}}$ will misinterpret their data. They measure the current $I$ and plot it against $V_{\\text{cmd}}$, believing this represents the true current-voltage relationship of the channel. However, the current $I$ is actually governed by the true membrane potential, $V_m$.\n\nFor an outward potassium current, the flow of positive K$^+$ ions is out of the cell. By convention, this outward current $I$ is positive ($I > 0$). Therefore, the voltage drop $I \\cdot R_s$ is also positive. This means:\n$$V_m = V_{\\text{cmd}} - I \\cdot R_s  V_{\\text{cmd}}$$\nThe true membrane potential is less depolarized (or more hyperpolarized) than the command voltage. The experimenter thinks they are measuring the current at $V_{\\text{cmd}}$ but are actually measuring the current corresponding to the smaller driving force at $V_m$. As a result, the measured current at a given $V_{\\text{cmd}}$ is an **underestimate** of the current that would truly flow if the membrane were perfectly clamped to $V_{\\text{cmd}}$. This biases the apparent current-voltage curve, making the conductance seem smaller than it is, especially at large voltages where currents are large.\n\nThe bias becomes appreciable when the voltage error, $I \\cdot R_s$, is a significant fraction of the overall potential scale of interest, such as the driving force $V_m - E_K$. This condition is met when the product $I \\cdot R_s$ is large. This occurs when the current $I$ is large (i.e., for channels with large conductance like BK channels, or at large driving potentials) and/or when the series resistance $R_s$ itself is large (due to factors like a suboptimal patch-clamp pipette).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{32.5}$$", "id": "2702462"}, {"introduction": "While current flow describes what happens when a channel is open, the critical question for a calcium-activated channel is what controls its opening.

It is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution. We shall proceed.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part solution: a derivation, a calculation, and an interpretation, based on the Hill model for cooperative binding.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Open Probability $P_{o}$\n\nThe problem postulates a simplified, cooperative binding reaction for the activation of the channel. Let the CaM-channel complex be the receptor, $R$, and the calcium ion be the ligand, $L$ (where $[L]$ corresponds to $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$). The binding of $n$ ligands to the receptor is modeled as a single-step cooperative process at equilibrium:\n$$ R + nL \\rightleftharpoons RL_n $$\nHere, $R$ represents the closed state of the channel complex, and $RL_n$ represents the open state. According to the law of mass action, the macroscopic dissociation constant, $K_{diss}$, for this reaction is given by:\n$$ K_{diss} = \\frac{[R][L]^n}{[RL_n]} $$\nThe problem states that the steady-state open probability, $P_o$, is equivalent to the fractional occupancy of the receptor by the ligand. The fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of bound receptors to the total concentration of receptors:\n$$ P_o = \\theta = \\frac{[RL_n]}{[R]_{total}} = \\frac{[RL_n]}{[R] + [RL_n]} $$\nTo express $P_o$ in terms of the ligand concentration $[L]$, we first rearrange the expression for the dissociation constant to solve for $[R]$:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{K_{diss} [RL_n]}{[L]^n} $$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the denominator of the equation for $P_o$:\n$$ P_o = \\frac{[RL_n]}{\\left( \\frac{K_{diss} [RL_n]}{[L]^n} \\right) + [RL_n]} $$\nThe term $[RL_n]$ is common to the numerator and both terms in the denominator, so it can be cancelled:\n$$ P_o = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{diss}}{[L]^n} + 1} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[L]^n$ yields the expression in a more common form:\n$$ P_o = \\frac{[L]^n}{K_{diss} + [L]^n} $$\nThe problem defines an \"effective dissociation constant\" $K_d$. In the context of the Hill equation, $K_d$ is specifically defined as the ligand concentration that produces half-maximal occupancy, i.e., $P_o = 0.5$ when $[L]=K_d$. Let us enforce this definition on our derived expression. Setting $[L] = K_d$ and $P_o = 1/2$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{K_d^n}{K_{diss} + K_d^n} $$\n$$ K_{diss} + K_d^n = 2 K_d^n $$\n$$ K_{diss} = K_d^n $$\nThis result connects the macroscopic dissociation constant $K_{diss}$ to the half-occupancy constant $K_d$. Substituting $K_d^n$ for $K_{diss}$ in our expression for $P_o$ gives the final form of the Hill equation. Using the specific notation for the calcium concentration, $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$, we have:\n$$ P_o([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]) = \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^n}{K_d^n + [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^n} $$\nThis is the required analytical dependence of $P_o$ on $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$, $K_d$, and $n$.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of $P_{o}$\n\nWe are given the parameters $K_d = 0.5~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $n=4$. We will use the derived formula to calculate $P_o$ for the three specified calcium concentrations. The expression can be conveniently rewritten as:\n$$ P_o([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{K_d}\\right)^n}{1 + \\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{K_d}\\right)^n} $$\n\nCase (i): $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] = 0.2~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\nThe ratio of concentrations is $\\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{K_d} = \\frac{0.2}{0.5} = 0.4$.\n$$ P_o = \\frac{(0.4)^4}{1 + (0.4)^4} = \\frac{0.0256}{1 + 0.0256} = \\frac{0.0256}{1.0256} \\approx 0.02496099... $$\nRounded to four significant figures, $P_o = 0.02496$.\n\nCase (ii): $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] = 0.5~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\nThe ratio of concentrations is $\\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{K_d} = \\frac{0.5}{0.5} = 1$.\n$$ P_o = \\frac{(1)^4}{1 + (1)^4} = \\frac{1}{1 + 1} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 $$\nAs required by the definition of $K_d$, the open probability is exactly $0.5$. To four significant figures, this is $0.5000$.\n\nCase (iii): $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] = 2~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\nThe ratio of concentrations is $\\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{K_d} = \\frac{2}{0.5} = 4$.\n$$ P_o = \\frac{(4)^4}{1 + (4)^4} = \\frac{256}{1 + 256} = \\frac{256}{257} \\approx 0.9961089... $$\nRounded to four significant figures, $P_o = 0.9961$.\n\nPart 3: Interpretation of the Hill Coefficient $n=4$\n\nThe Hill coefficient, $n$, quantifies the degree of cooperativity in a binding process.\n- If $n=1$, the binding is non-cooperative.\n- If $n > 1$, the binding exhibits positive cooperativity, meaning the binding of one ligand molecule increases the affinity of the receptor for subsequent ligand molecules.\n- If $0  n  1$, the binding exhibits negative cooperativity.\n\nIn this problem, $n=4$. This value, being significantly greater than $1$, indicates strong positive cooperativity. Physically, this means that the binding of the first calcium ion to the CaM-channel complex substantially promotes the binding of the subsequent calcium ions. The value $n=4$ corresponds to the fact that calmodulin has four calcium-binding sites (EF-hands). While the Hill model is a phenomenological simplification and does not imply a literal one-step binding of four ions, it effectively describes a system where the channel is very unlikely to open until multiple sites are occupied. This high cooperativity creates a steep, switch-like activation profile. A small change in $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ around the $K_d$ value results in a large change in the channel's open probability, allowing the channel to function as a sensitive and effective detector of intracellular calcium transients.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.02496  0.5000  0.9961 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2702429"}, {"introduction": "Effective signaling requires not only the right molecules but also their precise arrangement in space and time.
