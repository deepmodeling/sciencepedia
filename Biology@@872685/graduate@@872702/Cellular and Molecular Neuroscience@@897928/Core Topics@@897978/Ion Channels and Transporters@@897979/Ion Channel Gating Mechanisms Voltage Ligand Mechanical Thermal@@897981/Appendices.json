Assuming the movement of an effective positive gating charge $z$ outward across the membrane facilitates opening, the electrical work done *on the system* as it transitions from closed to open changes its free energy. The standard convention for this change is $\\Delta G_{elec} = -zFV$, where $V$ is the membrane potential (inside relative to outside).
