The structure is logical and requires connecting a microscopic description (movement of individual arginines) to a macroscopic, experimentally measurable parameter (the gating charge).\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with a complete solution.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe task is to determine the macroscopic gating charge, $Q_g$, from the microscopic movement of individual charges within the channel's voltage sensor. We are given two fundamental relations: the electrical work, $\\Delta W$, done on a charge $q$ moving through a potential difference $\\Delta V$, and the definition of gating charge, $Q_g$, in terms of the change in electrostatic free energy, $\\Delta G_{\\text{el}}$.\n\nThe connection between these quantities lies in the principle that the change in a system's electrostatic potential energy is the negative of the work done by the conservative electric field. Assuming the change in electrostatic free energy is dominated by this potential energy change, we have $\\Delta G_{\\text{el}} = -\\Delta W_{\\text{field}}$.\n\nLet us consider a single arginine side chain with charge $q_i = +e_0$. This charge does not traverse the full transmembrane potential difference, $\\Delta V$. Instead, it translocates through a portion of the electric field equivalent to a fraction $\\delta$ of the total potential difference. Thus, the effective potential difference experienced by this single charge is $\\Delta V_{\\text{eff}} = \\delta \\Delta V$.\n\nUsing the provided definition for electrical work, the work done *by the field* on this single charge during the conformational change is:\n$$ \\Delta W_i = q_i \\Delta V_{\\text{eff}} = e_0 (\\delta \\Delta V) $$\n\nThe problem states there are $N=4$ such charges in the S4 segment. To find the total change in energy for the entire channel, we must sum the contributions from each charge. Here, we must introduce a key simplifying assumption: **the $N$ charged residues are assumed to move independently**. This means that the movement of one charge does not electrostatically influence the energy of the others. Under this assumption, the total work done by the field is the sum of the work done on each individual charge:\n$$ \\Delta W_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\Delta W_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (e_0 \\delta \\Delta V) $$\nSince all terms in the sum are identical, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta W_{\\text{total}} = N e_0 \\delta \\Delta V $$\n\nThe total change in electrostatic free energy of the channel protein, $\\Delta G_{\\text{el}}$, is the negative of the total work done by the internal electric field:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{el}} = - \\Delta W_{\\text{total}} = -N e_0 \\delta \\Delta V $$\n\nWe are given the macroscopic definition of the gating charge, $Q_g$, as:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{el}} = -Q_g \\Delta V $$\n\nBy equating these two expressions for $\\Delta G_{\\text{el}}$, we can solve for $Q_g$:\n$$ -Q_g \\Delta V = -N e_0 \\delta \\Delta V $$\nAssuming a non-zero potential step ($\\Delta V \\neq 0$), we can divide both sides by $-\\Delta V$ to find the relationship between the macroscopic gating charge and the microscopic parameters:\n$$ Q_g = N e_0 \\delta $$\nThis result shows that the total gating charge is the total number of elementary charges involved in gating, scaled by the fraction of the electric field through which they move.\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n- Number of charges, $N = 4$.\n- Elementary charge, $e_0 = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$.\n- Fractional distance, $\\delta = 0.5$.\n\n$$ Q_g = 4 \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}) \\times 0.5 $$\n$$ Q_g = 2 \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}) $$\n$$ Q_g = 3.204 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C} $$\n\nThe result is required to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is free of inconsistencies, unrealistic conditions, or ambiguity.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\nDerivation of Solution\nThe behavior of the voltage-gated channel is governed by the movement of its charged voltage sensors ($S4$ segments) in response to the transmembrane electric field. The equilibrium distribution of the voltage sensor between its resting and activated states follows Boltzmann statistics.\n\nLet $z_{\\text{eff}}$ be the effective number of elementary charges, $e$, on a single voltage sensor that moves across the electric field. The energy difference, $\\Delta E$, between the activated and resting states of a single sensor at a membrane potential $V$ is given by:\n$$ \\Delta E(V) = \\Delta E_0 - z_{\\text{eff}} e V $$\nwhere $\\Delta E_0$ is the intrinsic energy difference at $V=0$. The probability of a sensor being in the activated state is:\n$$ P_{\\text{act}}(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{\\Delta E(V) / (k_B T)}} = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{(\\Delta E_0 - z_{\\text{eff}} e V) / (k_B T)}} $$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nAnalysis of the $Q\\text{-}V$ Curve\nThe $Q\\text{-}V$ curve measures the total gating charge, $Q(V)$, displaced at a given voltage $V$.\n1.  **Maximum Gating Charge ($Q_{\\max}$)**: This is the total charge moved when all voltage sensors in all channels are in the activated state. It is given by $Q_{\\max} = N \\cdot n \\cdot z_{\\text{eff}} \\cdot e$, where $N$ is the total number of channels and $n$ is the number of subunits (here, $n=4$). The mutation neutralizes one positive charge per subunit, so the effective charge $z_{\\text{eff}}$ is reduced. Since $N$ and $n$ are constant, $Q_{\\max}$ must decrease.\n\n2.  **Midpoint Voltage ($V_{1/2}$)**: This is the voltage at which half the maximal charge is moved, i.e., $P_{\\text{act}}(V_{1/2}) = 1/2$. This occurs when the exponent in the Boltzmann function is zero: $\\Delta E(V_{1/2}) = 0$.\n    $$ \\Delta E_0 - z_{\\text{eff}} e V_{1/2} = 0 \\implies V_{1/2} = \\frac{\\Delta E_0}{z_{\\text{eff}} e} $$\n    The mutation reduces $z_{\\text{eff}}$. Assuming $\\Delta E_0$ is relatively constant (part of the \"intrinsic coupling\" that is preserved), a smaller denominator $z_{\\text{eff}}$ requires a larger magnitude of $V$ to make the product $z_{\\text{eff}}eV$ equal to $\\Delta E_0$. The movement of positive charge is driven by depolarization (positive-going voltage). Thus, to achieve the same energetic favorability for activation with less charge, a stronger depolarization is required. This means the $Q\\text{-}V$ curve will shift to more positive, or depolarized, potentials. Therefore, $V_{1/2}$ will increase.\n\n3.  **Slope of the Curve**: The steepness of the voltage dependence is determined by $z_{\\text{eff}}$. From the Boltzmann equation, the curve is shallower for a smaller $z_{\\text{eff}}$. The slope factor, often denoted $k$, is inversely related to steepness (e.g., $k = k_B T / (z_{\\text{eff}} e)$). A smaller $z_{\\text{eff}}$ leads to a larger slope factor, corresponding to a shallower curve.\n\nSummary for $Q\\text{-}V$: $V_{1/2}$ increases (shifts to depolarized potentials), the slope becomes shallower (slope factor increases), and $Q_{\\max}$ decreases.\n\nAnalysis of the $G\\text{-}V$ Curve\nThe $G\\text{-}V$ curve measures the macroscopic conductance, $G(V) = G_{\\max} \\cdot P_{\\text{open}}(V)$, where $P_{\\text{open}}(V)$ is the open probability of the channel.\n1.  **Maximum Conductance ($G_{\\max}$)**: This is the conductance when all channels are open ($P_{\\text{open}}=1$). $G_{\\max} = N \\cdot \\gamma$, where $\\gamma$ is the single-channel conductance. The problem explicitly states that both $N$ and $\\gamma$ are unaltered. Therefore, $G_{\\max}$ is unchanged.\n\n2.  **$V_{1/2}$ and Slope**: The opening of the pore is tightly coupled to the activation of the voltage sensors. The problem states that the \"intrinsic coupling scheme\" is preserved. This means that the functional link between voltage sensor movement and pore opening is the same. Consequently, the voltage dependence of pore opening, $P_{\\text{open}}(V)$, must reflect the altered voltage dependence of the underlying sensor activation. Because the activation of the sensors ($Q\\text{-}V$) now requires more depolarization and is less sensitive to voltage (shallower), the opening of the pore ($G\\text{-}V$) will also require more depolarization and be less sensitive to voltage. Therefore, the $G\\text{-}V$ curve will shift to a more depolarized $V_{1/2}$ and will become shallower (larger slope factor), mirroring the changes in the $Q\\text{-}V$ curve. The total charge governing the steepness of the $G-V$ curve is related to the sum of charges from all subunits that contribute to the final concerted opening transition, which is also reduced.\n\nSummary for $G\\text{-}V$: $V_{1/2}$ increases (shifts to depolarized potentials), the slope becomes shallower (slope factor increases), and $G_{\\max}$ is unchanged.\n\nOption-by-Option Analysis\n\nA.
