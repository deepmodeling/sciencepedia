It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of receptor pharmacology and the specific properties of the NMDA receptor. The co-agonist requirement and the removal of magnesium block are standard experimental paradigms. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, assumptions ($e.g.$, independent sites, mass-action kinetics), and data to derive a unique, meaningful solution. The language is objective and precise.

The fractional open probability, $P_{open}$, is therefore the joint probability of both sites being occupied. For independent events, this is the product of their individual probabilities. The probability of a single site being occupied is its fractional occupancy.

It is based on established biophysical models of ion channel function, specifically the NMDA receptor. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into three tasks. We will address them in sequence.\n\nTask 1: Derive the steady-state fraction of unblocked channels, $f_{\\mathrm{unblock}}$.\n\nThe problem states that the channel can exist in an unbound (conducting) state, $\\mathrm{U}$, and a magnesium-bound (non-conducting) state, $\\mathrm{B}$. The total population of channels available for block is proportional to the sum of the concentrations of these two states, $[\\mathrm{U}] + [\\mathrm{B}]$. The fraction of channels that are unblocked, $f_{\\mathrm{unblock}}$, is the ratio of the concentration of unblocked channels to the total concentration of channels:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{unblock}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{U}]}{[\\mathrm{U}] + [\\mathrm{B}]}\n$$\nThe blocking reaction is given as $\\mathrm{U} + \\mathrm{Mg}^{2+} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{B}$. At steady state, the law of mass action gives the dissociation constant $K_{d}(V)$ as:\n$$\nK_{d}(V) = \\frac{[\\mathrm{U}][\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]}{[\\mathrm{B}]}\n$$\nWe can rearrange this expression to solve for the concentration of the blocked state, $[\\mathrm{B}]$, in terms of the unblocked state, $[\\mathrm{U}]$:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{B}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{U}][\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]}{K_{d}(V)}\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[\\mathrm{B}]$ into the equation for $f_{\\mathrm{unblock}}$:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{unblock}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{U}]}{[\\mathrm{U}] + \\frac{[\\mathrm{U}][\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]}{K_{d}(V)}}\n$$\nThe term $[\\mathrm{U}]$ is common to the numerator and the denominator, so it can be factored out and cancelled:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{unblock}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{U}] \\times 1}{[\\mathrm{U}] \\left(1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]}{K_{d}(V)}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]}{K_{d}(V)}}\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the steady-state fraction of unblocked channels as a function of $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]$ and $K_{d}(V)$.\n\nTask 2: Derive $K_{d}(V)$ and explain the effect of depolarization.\n\nThe voltage dependence of the dissociation constant is described by the Woodhull model. The free energy of binding for the blocker, $\\Delta G_{bind}$, has a chemical component and a voltage-dependent electrical component. The relationship between the dissociation constant and the standard free energy of binding is $\\Delta G^\\circ_{bind} = RT \\ln(K_d)$.\n\nThe electrical component of the free energy, $\\Delta G_{elec}$, corresponds to the work done to move the charged blocker across a fraction $\\delta$ of the membrane electric field. For a cation with valence $z$ moving from the outside (by convention, at potential $0$) to a site at fractional electrical distance $\\delta$ across a membrane potential $V = V_{in} - V_{out}$, the change in electrostatic energy is $zF\\delta V$. Thus, the total free energy of binding at voltage $V$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{bind}(V) = \\Delta G_{bind}(0) + zF\\delta V\n$$\nSubstituting the relation $\\Delta G_{bind} = RT \\ln(K_d)$:\n$$\nRT \\ln(K_{d}(V)) = RT \\ln(K_{d}(0)) + zF\\delta V\n$$\nDividing by $RT$:\n$$\n\\ln(K_{d}(V)) = \\ln(K_{d}(0)) + \\frac{zF\\delta V}{RT}\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the expression for $K_{d}(V)$:\n$$\nK_{d}(V) = \\exp\\left(\\ln(K_{d}(0)) + \\frac{zF\\delta V}{RT}\\right) = K_{d}(0) \\exp\\left(\\frac{zF\\delta V}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the Woodhull equation for an external blocker. For an external divalent cation like $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, $z=+2$. The fractional distance $\\delta$ is positive. The constants $F$, $R$, and $T$ are also positive. Depolarization means the membrane potential $V$ increases (becomes less negative or positive). Consequently, the term in the exponent, $\\frac{zF\\delta V}{RT}$, increases. This leads to an increase in $K_{d}(V)$.\n\nA higher dissociation constant $K_{d}(V)$ signifies weaker binding of the blocker. Weaker binding means the blocker is less likely to occupy its site in the pore. This relieves the block. To confirm this from the expression in Task 1:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{unblock}}(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]}{K_{d}(V)}}\n$$\nAs depolarization increases $V$, $K_{d}(V)$ increases. This causes the ratio $\\frac{[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]}{K_{d}(V)}$ to decrease. The decrease in this ratio leads to a smaller denominator, which in turn causes the fraction $f_{\\mathrm{unblock}}(V)$ to increase. Therefore, depolarization increases the unblocked fraction of channels by electrostatically repelling the positively charged magnesium ion from its binding site within the membrane's electric field.\n\nTask 3: Compute the normalized open probability $P_{\\mathrm{rel}}(V)$ at $V=-65\\ \\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nThe expression for $P_{\\mathrm{rel}}(V)$ is given as the product of the probabilities of ligand occupancy and the fraction of unblocked channels:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{rel}}(V) = \\left(\\frac{[{\\mathrm{Glu}}]}{[{\\mathrm{Glu}}]+K_{d,{\\mathrm{Glu}}}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{[{\\mathrm{Gly}}]}{[{\\mathrm{Gly}}]+K_{d,{\\mathrm{Gly}}}}\\right)\\times f_{\\mathrm{unblock}}(V)\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the ligand occupancy terms.

Expressing this in terms of dissociation constants, we have:\n$$\nRT \\ln(K_d(V)) = RT \\ln(K_d(0)) + z \\delta F V\n$$\nDividing by $RT$ and exponentiating gives the voltage-dependent dissociation constant, a result known as the Woodhull equation:\n$$\nK_d(V) = K_d(0) \\exp\\left(\\frac{z \\delta F V}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nThis equation shows that for a positively charged blocker (like $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, with $z0$) and a depolarizing potential ($V0$), $K_d(V)$ increases, signifying weaker binding (i.e., relief of block). Conversely, for a hyperpolarizing potential ($V0$), $K_d(V)$ decreases, signifying stronger block.\n\nSecond, we derive the unblocked fraction, $f_{\\mathrm{unblock}}(V)$. According to Principle 1, the fraction of channels occupied by the blocker $B$ is given by the Langmuir isotherm:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{block}}(V) = \\frac{[B]}{[B] + K_d(V)}\n$$\nwhere $[B]$ is the concentration of the blocker. Principle 3 states that the unblocked fraction is the probability that the site is not occupied, which is simply $1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{block}}(V)$.\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{unblock}}(V) = 1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{block}}(V) = 1 - \\frac{[B]}{[B] + K_d(V)}\n$$\nCombining the terms on a common denominator yields:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{unblock}}(V) = \\frac{([B] + K_d(V)) - [B]}{[B] + K_d(V)} = \\frac{K_d(V)}{[B] + K_d(V)}\n$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $K_d(V)$:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{unblock}}(V) = \\frac{K_d(0) \\exp\\left(\\frac{z \\delta F V}{RT}\\right)}{[B] + K_d(0) \\exp\\left(\\frac{z \\delta F V}{RT}\\right)}\n$$\nFor computational stability and clarity, we can divide the numerator and denominator by the exponential term, arriving at the final expression:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{unblock}}(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_d(0)} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z \\delta F V}{RT}\\right)}\n$$\nThis equation formalizes the voltage-dependent unblocked fraction based on the given principles.\n\nThe model for $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ replacement is that $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ does not act as a blocker at this site, which is implemented by setting the blocker concentration $[B]=0$. In this scenario, the formula simplifies to:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{unblock}}(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + 0} = 1\n$$\nThis result is physically correct: if there is no blocking particle, the channel is always unblocked, irrespective of membrane potential.\n\nFinally, the coincidence gain metric, $\\Delta f$, is calculated as the difference between the unblocked fraction at a high (depolarized) potential, $V_{\\mathrm{high}}$, and a low (hyperpolarized) potential, $V_{\\mathrm{low}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta f = f_{\\mathrm{unblock}}(V_{\\mathrm{high}}) - f_{\\mathrm{unblock}}(V_{\\mathrm{low}})\n$$\nFor the $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ replacement case, $\\Delta f = 1 - 1 = 0$. For all other cases, we use the full expression for $f_{\\mathrm{unblock}}(V)$ with the specified parameters.\n\nWe will now implement a program to compute $\\Delta f$ for each of the five test cases using the derived formula and provided constants.\nConstants for computation are:\n- $R = 8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $F = 96485.33212\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $T = 298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $z = 2$ for $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$\n- $K_{d}(0) = 3.3 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M}$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{[0.697660, 0.000000, 0.407480, 0.063230, 0.590518]}$$", "id": "2770982"}]}
