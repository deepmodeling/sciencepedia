This clearance is a race between two fundamental processes: the physical diffusion of ACh molecules away from receptors and their enzymatic destruction by acetylcholinesterase (AChE). This exercise invites you to quantitatively compare the characteristic timescales of these two events, providing a biophysical basis for understanding why AChE is essential for terminating the synaptic signal with high temporal precision.

It presents a standard biophysical problem concerning reaction-diffusion kinetics in a neuronal synapse. All provided physical constants are within realistic ranges for the specified biological system. The approximations requested are standard and appropriate for an order-of-magnitude estimation. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of a dimensionless ratio, $R$, which compares the characteristic time for diffusion of an acetylcholine (ACh) molecule across the synaptic cleft to the characteristic time for its enzymatic hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase (AChE).\n\nFirst, we determine the characteristic diffusion time, $\\tau_d$. The problem specifies a one-dimensional treatment. The one-dimensional diffusion equation for the concentration $C(x,t)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. A fundamental result derived from this equation is the mean-squared displacement (MSD) for a particle undergoing a one-dimensional random walk, which is:\n$$\n\\langle x^2 \\rangle(t) = 2Dt\n$$\nHere, $\\langle x^2 \\rangle(t)$ is the average of the squared displacement from the origin after a time $t$. A standard and valid approximation for the characteristic time, $\\tau_d$, required for a particle to traverse a characteristic distance $L$ is the time at which the root-mean-square displacement, $\\sqrt{\\langle x^2 \\rangle}$, is equal to $L$. This is equivalent to setting the MSD equal to $L^2$. In this problem, the characteristic distance is the thickness of the synaptic cleft, given as $x_{\\text{cleft}} = 50.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. We set $L = x_{\\text{cleft}}$.\n$$\nL^2 = 2D\\tau_d\n$$\nSolving for the characteristic diffusion time $\\tau_d$:\n$$\n\\tau_d = \\frac{L^2}{2D}\n$$\nThis model is justified because the cleft thickness ($L$) is significantly smaller than the lateral dimensions of a typical synapse, making one-dimensional diffusion the dominant mode of transport from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic membrane.\n\nNext, we determine the characteristic hydrolysis time, $\\tau_h$. The problem states that the ACh concentration is high enough for AChE to operate near catalytic saturation. In enzyme kinetics, the turnover number, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$, is defined as the maximum number of substrate molecules that one active site of the enzyme can convert to product per unit time. This maximum rate is achieved when the enzyme is saturated with substrate, i.e., when $[ACh] \\gg K_M$, where $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant. Under these conditions, the process is limited only by the intrinsic catalytic speed of the enzyme. The characteristic time for a single catalytic event, or one turnover, is therefore the reciprocal of the turnover number. Thus, we define the characteristic hydrolysis time $\\tau_h$ as:\n$$\n\\tau_h = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}\n$$\nThis is a justified model for the minimum time required to eliminate a single molecule of ACh once it has bound to an active AChE enzyme.\n\nWe are asked to compute the dimensionless ratio $R$ of the characteristic diffusion time to the characteristic hydrolysis time:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\tau_d}{\\tau_h}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $\\tau_d$ and $\\tau_h$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{L^2}{2D} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}} \\right)} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} L^2}{2D}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the provided values into this expression. The values must be in consistent SI units.\nGiven:\nCleft thickness, $L = 50.0\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 50.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 5.00 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nDiffusion coefficient, $D = 5.00 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$.\nCatalytic turnover number, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}} = 1.40 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{(1.40 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times (5.00 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{2 \\times (5.00 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}})}\n$$\n$$\nR = \\frac{(1.40 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times (2.50 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{m^2})}{1.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}}\n$$\n$$\nR = \\frac{3.50 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}}\n$$\n$$\nR = 3.50 \\times 10^{-2}\n$$\nThe result is $0.0350$. This dimensionless number being significantly less than $1$ implies that the characteristic time for an ACh molecule to be hydrolyzed by a saturated AChE enzyme is much longer than the time it takes for that molecule to diffuse across the synaptic cleft. This suggests that the process of clearing ACh from the cleft is not limited by diffusion, but rather by the rate of the enzymatic reaction. This is consistent with the biological role of AChE, which must act with extreme rapidity to terminate the synaptic signal, and its high concentration in the postsynaptic membrane ensures that diffusion to an enzyme, not the catalytic action itself, is the faster process. The calculation here compares the diffusion time to the *turnover* time. A small ratio $R<1$ means diffusion is much faster than catalysis.\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures.

The time to synaptic failure, $t_f$, is the time it takes to deplete the initial cytosolic pool of acetylcholine, $N_0$, given a constant rate of consumption, $R$.\n\nThe governing first-principles relation for the number of ACh molecules in the cytosol, $N(t)$, is a simple balance equation:\n$$ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = \\text{Rate}_{\\text{synthesis}} - \\text{Rate}_{\\text{consumption}} $$\nAccording to the problem statement, after the CHT1 block at $t=0$, there is no net ACh production. Therefore, $\\text{Rate}_{\\text{synthesis}} = 0$.\n\nThe rate of consumption, $R$, is the rate at which ACh is removed from the cytosol to refill synaptic vesicles. The problem states that this rate is equal to the average rate of ACh release from the presynaptic terminal. This rate is the product of the firing frequency ($f$), the mean number of vesicles released per action potential ($\\bar{m}$), and the number of ACh molecules per vesicle ($v$). All these parameters are given as constants.\n$$ R = \\text{Rate}_{\\text{consumption}} = f \\cdot \\bar{m} \\cdot v $$\nThus, the governing differential equation for $t \\ge 0$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = - f \\bar{m} v $$\nThe initial condition is the number of ACh molecules in the cytosol at $t=0$, which we denote as $N_0$. Synaptic failure occurs at time $t_f$ when the pool is exhausted, i.e., $N(t_f)=0$.\n\nIntegrating the differential equation from $t=0$ to $t=t_f$:\n$$ \\int_{N_0}^{0} dN(t) = \\int_{0}^{t_f} (-f \\bar{m} v) dt $$\n$$ [N(t)]_{N_0}^{0} = - f \\bar{m} v [t]_{0}^{t_f} $$\n$$ 0 - N_0 = - f \\bar{m} v (t_f - 0) $$\n$$ t_f = \\frac{N_0}{f \\bar{m} v} $$\nThe task is now reduced to calculating the initial number of molecules, $N_0$, and the consumption rate, $R$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial number of ACh molecules, $N_0$. This is found from the initial concentration, $[{\\mathrm{ACh}}]_{0}$, the cytosolic volume, $V_{\\mathrm{cyto}}$, and Avogadro's constant, $N_{\\mathrm{A}}$.\n$$ N_0 = [{\\mathrm{ACh}}]_{0} \\cdot V_{\\mathrm{cyto}} \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{A}} $$\nProper unit conversion is critical. The volume must be converted from cubic micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}^3$) to liters (L) to be compatible with the molar concentration (M or $\\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{L}$).\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{cyto}} = 0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{3} = 0.5 \\times (10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})^{3} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3} $$\nSince $1\\,\\mathrm{L} = 1\\,\\mathrm{dm}^3 = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}$, the conversion to liters is:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{cyto}} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{L}}{10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{L} $$\nThe initial concentration is given as $[{\\mathrm{ACh}}]_{0} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\nNow, we compute $N_0$:\n$$ N_0 = (2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}) \\times (0.5 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{L}) \\times (6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) $$\n$$ N_0 = (1.0 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{mol}) \\times (6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) = 6.022 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\text{molecules} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the constant rate of ACh consumption, $R$:\n$$ R = f \\cdot \\bar{m} \\cdot v = (10\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (0.3) \\cdot (7000\\,\\text{molecules}) $$\n$$ R = 21000\\,\\text{molecules}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 2.1 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{molecules}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the time to failure, $t_f$:\n$$ t_f = \\frac{N_0}{R} = \\frac{6.022 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\text{molecules}}{2.1 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{molecules}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} $$\n$$ t_f \\approx 28.67619\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ t_f \\approx 28.7\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nThis is the time until the cytosolic pool of acetylcholine is completely depleted, leading to synaptic failure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{28.7}$$", "id": "2759941"}]}
