It presents a standard scenario in receptor pharmacology that can be formalized and solved using fundamental principles. All necessary information and assumptions are provided. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the relationship between the agonist's half-maximal effective concentration ($EC_{50}$) in the presence and absence of a competitive antagonist, and subsequently to calculate the fold-change for specific concentrations. The system consists of a population of receptors, $R$, which can bind either an agonist, $A$ (GABA), or a competitive antagonist, $B$ (e.g., bicuculline), at the same orthosteric site.\n\nWe begin by defining the possible states of the receptor: it can be free ($[R]$), bound to the agonist ($[RA]$), or bound to the antagonist ($[RB]$). The total concentration of receptors, $[R_T]$, is constant, which gives the conservation equation:\n$$[R_T] = [R] + [RA] + [RB]$$\n\nThe binding reactions are assumed to be at rapid equilibrium. The dissociation constants for the agonist ($K_A$) and the antagonist ($K_B$) are defined by the law of mass action:\n$$K_A = \\frac{[R][A]}{[RA]}$$\n$$K_B = \\frac{[R][B]}{[RB]}$$\n\nFrom these equilibrium relationships, we can express the concentrations of the bound states in terms of the free receptor concentration $[R]$:\n$$[RA] = \\frac{[R][A]}{K_A}$$\n$$[RB] = \\frac{[R][B]}{K_B}$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the receptor conservation equation allows us to express $[R_T]$ in terms of $[R]$ and the ligand concentrations:\n$$[R_T] = [R] + \\frac{[R][A]}{K_A} + \\frac{[R][B]}{K_B}$$\nFactoring out $[R]$ yields:\n$$[R_T] = [R] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_A} + \\frac{[B]}{K_B} \\right)$$\n\nThe problem states that the normalized response is equal to the fraction of receptors occupied by the agonist. Let this fractional occupancy be denoted by $Y$.\n$$Y = \\frac{[RA]}{[R_T]}$$\n\nWe substitute the expressions for $[RA]$ and $[R_T]$:\n$$Y = \\frac{\\frac{[R][A]}{K_A}}{[R] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_A} + \\frac{[B]}{K_B} \\right)}$$\nThe term $[R]$ cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$Y = \\frac{\\frac{[A]}{K_A}}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_A} + \\frac{[B]}{K_B}}$$\nTo simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $K_A$:\n$$Y = \\frac{[A]}{K_A \\left( 1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_A} + \\frac{[B]}{K_B} \\right)} = \\frac{[A]}{K_A + [A] + K_A\\frac{[B]}{K_B}}$$\nRearranging the denominator to group terms gives the final form of the agonist occupancy equation in the presence of a competitive antagonist:\n$$Y = \\frac{[A]}{K_A\\left(1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_B}\\right) + [A]}$$\n\nNow, we must find the relationship between the $EC_{50}$ values. The $EC_{50}$ is the concentration of agonist that produces a half-maximal response, i.e., $Y=0.5$.\n\nFirst, consider the case without antagonist, where $[B]=0$. Let the $EC_{50}$ in this case be denoted as $EC_{50, \\text{no antag}}$. The occupancy equation simplifies to:\n$$Y = \\frac{[A]}{K_A + [A]}$$\nSetting $Y=0.5$ and $[A] = EC_{50, \\text{no antag}}$:\n$$0.5 = \\frac{EC_{50, \\text{no antag}}}{K_A + EC_{50, \\text{no antag}}}$$\nSolving for $EC_{50, \\text{no antag}}$ gives:\n$$0.5(K_A + EC_{50, \\text{no antag}}) = EC_{50, \\text{no antag}}$$\n$$0.5 K_A = 0.5 EC_{50, \\text{no antag}}$$\n$$EC_{50, \\text{no antag}} = K_A$$\n\nNext, consider the case with a fixed concentration of antagonist, $[B]$. Let the apparent $EC_{50}$ in this case be denoted as $EC'_{50}$. We use the full occupancy equation:\n$$Y = \\frac{[A]}{K_A\\left(1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_B}\\right) + [A]}$$\nSetting $Y=0.5$ and $[A] = EC'_{50}$:\n$$0.5 = \\frac{EC'_{50}}{K_A\\left(1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_B}\\right) + EC'_{50}}$$\nSolving for $EC'_{50}$ gives:\n$$0.5 \\left( K_A\\left(1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_B}\\right) + EC'_{50} \\right) = EC'_{50}$$\n$$0.5 K_A\\left(1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_B}\\right) = 0.5 EC'_{50}$$\n$$EC'_{50} = K_A\\left(1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_B}\\right)$$\n\nThe relationship between the apparent $EC_{50}$ and the baseline $EC_{50}$ is found by taking their ratio, which is defined as the dose ratio ($DR$) or fold-change:\n$$DR = \\frac{EC'_{50}}{EC_{50, \\text{no antag}}} = \\frac{K_A\\left(1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_B}\\right)}{K_A}$$\nThis simplifies to the Gaddum-Schild equation:\n$$DR = 1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_B}$$\nThis is the required relationship. It shows that a competitive antagonist produces a parallel rightward shift in the agonist's concentration-response curve, and the magnitude of this shift depends on the antagonist's concentration $[B]$ and its dissociation constant $K_B$.\n\nFinally, we compute the fold-change for the given values:\n$$[\\mathrm{B}] = 0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n$$K_B = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n\nSubstituting these values into the dose ratio equation:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = DR = 1 + \\frac{0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5$$\nThe fold-change in the apparent GABA $EC_{50}$ is $1.5$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.5}\n$$", "id": "2737649"}, {"introduction": "GABAergic inhibition is often more subtle than simply hyperpolarizing a neuron; it can powerfully modulate excitability by altering the cell's input resistance.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe state of the neuron is described by the membrane potential, $V_m$, which evolves according to the current-balance equation for a single-compartment model:\n$$C_m \\frac{dV_m}{dt} = -I_{ion} + I_{app}$$\nwhere $C_m$ is the membrane capacitance, $I_{ion}$ is the sum of ionic currents through membrane channels, and $I_{app}$ is any externally applied current. In this problem, the ionic currents are the leak current ($I_L$) and the GABAergic current ($I_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$), and the applied current is the excitatory synaptic current, $I_{exc}(t)$.\n\nThe ionic currents follow Ohm's law:\n$$I_L = g_L (V_m - E_L)$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{GABA}} = g_{\\mathrm{GABA}} (V_m - E_{\\mathrm{GABA}})$$\n\nThe full membrane equation is:\n$$C_m \\frac{dV_m}{dt} = -g_L(V_m - E_L) - g_{\\mathrm{GABA}}(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}) + I_{exc}(t)$$\n\nThis can be rewritten by grouping terms related to $V_m$:\n$$C_m \\frac{dV_m}{dt} + (g_L + g_{\\mathrm{GABA}})V_m = g_L E_L + g_{\\mathrm{GABA}} E_{\\mathrm{GABA}} + I_{exc}(t)$$\n\nFirst, we address the justification of \"shunting inhibition\". Inhibition is any process that makes a neuron less likely to fire an action potential. Shunting inhibition specifically refers to the mechanism where an increase in membrane conductance reduces the amplitude of a postsynaptic potential.\nThe amplitude of a voltage deflection, $\\Delta V$, in response to an injected current, $I$, is governed by the input resistance of the neuron, $R_{in}$, according to Ohm's Law ($\\Delta V = I \\cdot R_{in}$). The input resistance is the reciprocal of the total membrane conductance, $G_{tot}$.\nIn the control case (no drug), the total conductance is $G_{tot, ctrl} = g_L$.\nIn the presence of the benzodiazepine, the total conductance increases to $G_{tot, drug} = g_L + g_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$.\nSince $g_{\\mathrm{GABA}}  0$, we have $G_{tot, drug}  G_{tot, ctrl}$. Consequently, the input resistance is lower with the drug: $R_{in, drug}  R_{in, ctrl}$.\nFor the same excitatory current $I_{exc}(t)$, the resulting EPSP amplitude will be smaller in the presence of the drug because the additional open $\\mathrm{GABA_A}$ channels provide a \"shunt\" for the excitatory current to leak out. This reduction in EPSP amplitude is shunting inhibition. This effect is independent of the value of $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$; it is a direct consequence of the increased membrane conductance. The fact that $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ is depolarizing ($E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}  E_L$) means the drug also depolarizes the resting potential, bringing it closer to the firing threshold. However, the shunting mechanism itself, which reduces the *change* in voltage during the EPSP, remains inhibitory in nature.\n\nNext, we compute the scaling factor for the peak EPSP amplitude. The problem specifies that EPSPs are small deflections, justifying a linear analysis around the operating point (the resting potential). The EPSP amplitude is the peak voltage deflection, $\\Delta V_{peak}$, above the resting potential.\nThe governing equation for the voltage deflection $\\Delta V(t) = V_m(t) - V_{rest}$ is:\n$$C_m \\frac{d\\Delta V}{dt} + G_{tot} \\Delta V = I_{exc}(t)$$\nwhere $G_{tot}$ is the total conductance in the given condition. The amplitude of the solution $\\Delta V(t)$ depends on $G_{tot}$. A common and valid simplification, implied by the problem's focus on \"ohmic\" properties and the absence of capacitance or timing information, is to consider the regime where capacitive currents are negligible at the peak of the EPSP. Tnis means the peak amplitude $\\Delta V_{peak}$ is proportional to the input resistance $R_{in} = 1/G_{tot}$.\nLet the peak EPSP amplitude be $\\Delta V_{peak}$.\n$\\Delta V_{peak} \\propto R_{in} = \\frac{1}{G_{tot}}$.\n\nIn the control condition (no drug):\n$G_{tot, ctrl} = g_L$.\nThe EPSP amplitude is $\\Delta V_{peak, ctrl} \\propto \\frac{1}{g_L}$.\n\nIn the drug condition:\n$G_{tot, drug} = g_L + g_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$.\nThe EPSP amplitude is $\\Delta V_{peak, drug} \\propto \\frac{1}{g_L + g_{\\mathrm{GABA}}}$.\n\nThe factor by which the peak EPSP amplitude is scaled is the ratio of the amplitude with the drug to the amplitude without the drug:\n$$\\text{Scaling Factor} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{peak, drug}}{\\Delta V_{peak, ctrl}} = \\frac{1/(g_L + g_{\\mathrm{GABA}})}{1/g_L} = \\frac{g_L}{g_L + g_{\\mathrm{GABA}}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$g_L = 5\\,\\mathrm{nS}$\n$g_{\\mathrm{GABA}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nS}$\n\n$$\\text{Scaling Factor} = \\frac{5\\,\\mathrm{nS}}{5\\,\\mathrm{nS} + 10\\,\\mathrm{nS}} = \\frac{5}{15} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nThe peak EPSP amplitude in the presence of the benzodiazepine-enhanced GABAergic conductance is thus reduced to one-third of its control value.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$$", "id": "2737692"}, {"introduction": "The theoretical concepts of receptor activity and conductance find their meaning in tangible, measurable phenomena within the neuron.

It requires the design of a standard electrophysiological experiment and a subsequent calculation based on fundamental biophysical principles. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, the methodological design for quantifying tonic $\\mathrm{GABA_A}$ receptor-mediated inhibition in a single neuron. The procedure is based on the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique.\n\nThe initial step is to establish a stable whole-cell voltage-clamp recording from a cortical pyramidal neuron. The intracellular pipette solution must contain a low chloride concentration to set the $\\mathrm{GABA_A}$ reversal potential ($E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$) at a hyperpolarized level, such as the specified $-80\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, which is typical. This ensures a measurable outward current when the neuron is held at a depolarized potential relative to $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$, such as the specified $V_m = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. To isolate GABAergic currents, the external bathing solution must contain antagonists for other major neurotransmitter receptors. This includes an AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist (e.g., CNQX or NBQX) and an NMDA receptor antagonist (e.g., D-AP5). Additionally, to minimize contamination from voltage-gated currents, tetrodotoxin (TTX) is included to block sodium channels, and potassium channels are often blocked by using cesium-based intracellular solution and/or external application of blockers like tetraethylammonium (TEA).\n\nOnce a stable recording with isolated inhibitory postsynaptic currents is achieved, the neuron is held at a constant command potential, $V_m$. In this state, the amplifier injects a holding current, $I_{\\text{hold}}$, to maintain this potential. Any tonically active ion channels, such as extrasynaptic $\\mathrm{GABA_A}$ receptors, will contribute a steady current component, $I_{\\text{tonic}}$, to the overall transmembrane current.\n\nThe measurement of $I_{\\text{tonic}}$ is performed via two complementary methods:\n\n$1$. Measurement of the Holding Current Shift:\nA stable baseline of the holding current is recorded for a sufficient period (e.g., $2-5$ minutes). Subsequently, a saturating concentration of the $\\mathrm{GABA_A}$ receptor channel blocker, picrotoxin, is applied to the bath via perfusion. Picrotoxin blocks the pore of open $\\mathrm{GABA_A}$ receptor channels, thereby abolishing the current flowing through them. As the drug reaches equilibrium, the holding current will shift to a new, stable level. The difference between the average holding current before the application of picrotoxin ($I_{\\text{hold, pre}}$) and after its effect has saturated ($I_{\\text{hold, post}}$) represents the tonic current that was blocked.\n$$I_{\\text{tonic}} = I_{\\text{hold, pre}} - I_{\\text{hold, post}}$$\nThis change, $\\Delta I_{\\text{hold}}$, provides a direct, quantitative measure of the magnitude of the tonic GABAergic current.\n\n$2$. Measurement of the Baseline Noise Change:\nThe stochastic opening and closing of individual ion channels generate fluctuations in the macroscopic current, which manifest as electrical noise. The variance of the recorded current, $\\sigma^2$, is a measure of this noise. Tonically active $\\mathrm{GABA_A}$ receptors are a significant source of such noise. Their blockade by picrotoxin should, therefore, lead to a discernible reduction in the current variance. To quantify this, one calculates the variance of a segment of the current recording during the stable baseline period ($\\sigma^2_{\\text{pre}}$) and another segment after picrotoxin application has stabilized ($\\sigma^2_{\\text{post}}$). A significant reduction in variance, i.e., $\\sigma^2_{\\text{pre}}  \\sigma^2_{\\text{post}}$, provides strong qualitative validation for the presence of a tonically active population of channels that have been silenced. This change in noise confirms that the shift in holding current is due to the blockade of stochastically gating channels and not a non-specific drift in the recording.\n\nNow, we proceed to compute the tonic conductance based on the provided data. The relationship between ionic current, conductance, membrane potential, and reversal potential is described by Ohm's law for electrodiffusion:\n$$I_{\\text{ion}} = g_{\\text{ion}} (V_m - E_{\\text{ion}})$$\nFor the specific case of tonic $\\mathrm{GABA_A}$ current, this is:\n$$I_{\\text{tonic}} = g_{\\text{tonic}} (V_m - E_{\\text{GABA}})$$\nwhere $I_{\\text{tonic}}$ is the tonic current, $g_{\\text{tonic}}$ is the tonic conductance, $V_m$ is the membrane holding potential, and $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ is the reversal potential for $\\mathrm{GABA_A}$ receptor-mediated current.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nThe magnitude of the picrotoxin-sensitive holding current shift is given as $|I_{\\text{tonic}}| = 20\\,\\mathrm{pA} = 20 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}$.\nThe holding potential is $V_m = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV} = -70 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\nThe GABA reversal potential is $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}} = -80\\,\\mathrm{mV} = -80 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the driving force for chloride ions through the $\\mathrm{GABA_A}$ receptor:\n$$V_m - E_{\\text{GABA}} = (-70 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}) - (-80 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nSince the driving force is positive ($10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) and the permeant ion is an anion ($\\text{Cl}^{-}$), the current is an outward current (efflux of negative charge). The magnitude of this current is given as $20\\,\\mathrm{pA}$, so $I_{\\text{tonic}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{pA}$.\n\nWe can now solve for the tonic conductance, $g_{\\text{tonic}}$, by rearranging the equation:\n$$g_{\\text{tonic}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{tonic}}}{V_m - E_{\\text{GABA}}}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$g_{\\text{tonic}} = \\frac{20 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}}{10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}} = 2 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S}$$\nThe unit Siemens ($\\mathrm{S}$) is equivalent to Amperes per Volt ($\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{V}$).
