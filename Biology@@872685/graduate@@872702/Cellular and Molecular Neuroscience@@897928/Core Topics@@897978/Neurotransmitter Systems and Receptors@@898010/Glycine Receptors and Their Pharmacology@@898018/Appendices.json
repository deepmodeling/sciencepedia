We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe fundamental condition for equilibrium is that there is no net flux of the ion in question across the membrane. This occurs when the electrochemical potential for the ion is the same on both sides of the membrane. The electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}_{j}$, for an ionic species $j$ is the sum of its chemical potential and its electrical potential energy.

The problem is self-contained and allows for a unique, meaningful solution based on fundamental biophysical principles (Ohm's law for membranes, driving force, and synaptic integration). There are no scientific or logical contradictions, no ambiguities, and the problem is directly solvable using the provided data.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe analysis proceeds in two parts: first, the direct effect of GlyR activation on the membrane potential, and second, the effect of GlyR activation on the neuron's response to other synaptic inputs.\n\n1.  **Direct Effect of GlyR Activation on Membrane Potential ($V_m$)**\n\n    The current flowing through the open glycine receptors, $I_{\\mathrm{Gly}}$, is determined by the glycine conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{Gly}}$, and the driving force for the ions permeating the channel. The reversal potential for GlyR is given as $E_{\\mathrm{Gly}} \\approx E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = -45\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The driving force is the difference between the membrane potential, $V_m$, and the reversal potential, $E_{\\mathrm{Gly}}$.\n\n    The driving force is:\n    $$V_m - E_{\\mathrm{Gly}} = (-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}) - (-45\\,\\mathrm{mV}) = -5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n    The ionic current is given by $I_{\\mathrm{Gly}} = g_{\\mathrm{Gly}} (V_m - E_{\\mathrm{Gly}})$. Since GlyR channels are permeable to anions ($\\text{Cl}^-$), a negative driving force ($V_m < E_{\\mathrm{Gly}}$) will drive an efflux (outward movement) of chloride ions. The departure of negative charges from the cell is, by convention, a depolarizing inward current of positive charge.\n\n    Therefore, the activation of GlyR will cause a depolarization, shifting the membrane potential from its resting value of $V_m = -50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ toward the GlyR reversal potential of $E_{\\mathrm{Gly}} = -45\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\n    The new steady-state membrane potential, $V_{m, \\text{new}}$, in the presence of the additional glycine conductance can be calculated as the weighted average of the reversal potentials for the leak and glycine conductances:\n    $$V_{m, \\text{new}} = \\frac{g_{\\mathrm{L}}E_{\\mathrm{L}} + g_{\\mathrm{Gly}}E_{\\mathrm{Gly}}}{g_{\\mathrm{L}} + g_{\\mathrm{Gly}}}$$\n    Here, the reversal potential for the leak conductance, $E_{\\mathrm{L}}$, is the resting membrane potential itself, so $E_{\\mathrm{L}} = -50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Plugging in the given values:\n    $$V_{m, \\text{new}} = \\frac{(10\\,\\mathrm{nS})(-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}) + (5\\,\\mathrm{nS})(-45\\,\\mathrm{mV})}{10\\,\\mathrm{nS} + 5\\,\\mathrm{nS}} = \\frac{-500 - 225}{15} \\,\\mathrm{mV} = \\frac{-725}{15} \\,\\mathrm{mV} \\approx -48.33\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n    This calculation confirms a small depolarization from $-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to approximately $-48.33\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Since this new potential is far below the action potential threshold of $V_{\\mathrm{th}} = -35\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, this depolarization is not sufficient to be considered \"excitatory\".\n\n2.  **Effect of GlyR Activation on Input Resistance and EPSP Amplitude (\"Shunting\")**\n\n    Inhibition is defined as any process that makes a neuron less likely to fire an action potential. This can occur through hyperpolarization or by reducing the efficacy of excitatory inputs. The latter mechanism is known as shunting inhibition.\n\n    The input resistance of the neuron, $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$, is the inverse of its total membrane conductance, $g_{\\text{total}}$.\n    -   At rest: $g_{\\text{total, rest}} = g_{\\mathrm{L}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nS}$, so $R_{\\mathrm{in, rest}} = \\frac{1}{10 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$.\n    -   During GlyR activation: $g_{\\text{total, active}} = g_{\\mathrm{L}} + g_{\\mathrm{Gly}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nS} + 5\\,\\mathrm{nS} = 15\\,\\mathrm{nS}$.\n    -   The new input resistance is $R_{\\mathrm{in, active}} = \\frac{1}{15 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S}} \\approx 66.7\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$.\n\n    The activation of GlyR channels increases the total membrane conductance by $50\\%$, which in turn decreases the input resistance by one-third (from $100\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$ to $66.7\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$).\n\n    According to Ohm's law, the change in membrane potential, $\\Delta V$ (the excitatory postsynaptic potential, EPSP), caused by a synaptic current, $I$ (the EPSC), is given by $\\Delta V = I \\times R_{\\mathrm{in}}$. The problem states that the EPSC has a fixed amplitude. Therefore, the resulting EPSP amplitude is directly proportional to the input resistance.\n    $$\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{EPSP}} \\propto R_{\\mathrm{in}}$$\n    Since $R_{\\mathrm{in, active}} < R_{\\mathrm{in, rest}}$, the amplitude of an EPSP occurring during GlyR activation will be smaller than an EPSP occurring at rest. This reduction in EPSP amplitude is the \"shunting\" effect. The additional conductance provides a \"shunt\" pathway for the excitatory current to leak out across the membrane, reducing its effectiveness in depolarizing the cell toward the action potential threshold.\n\n    In summary, GlyR activation produces a small depolarization but simultaneously reduces the input resistance, thereby attenuating coincident excitatory signals. This combined effect makes it more difficult for the neuron to reach its firing threshold, $V_{\\mathrm{th}} = -35\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. This is the definition of depolarizing, or shunting, inhibition.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. **Hyperpolarizing inhibition: chloride influx makes $V_m$ more negative than $-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, and the increased conductance secondarily reduces excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs).**\n**Incorrect**. The driving force on chloride is $(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}) = (-50) - (-45) = -5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. This negative driving force on an anion causes an efflux (outward flow) of $\\text{Cl}^-$, leading to depolarization, not hyperpolarization. Hyperpolarization would require $V_m > E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$.\n\nB. **Depolarizing but inhibitory (shunting) effect: chloride efflux produces a small depolarization toward $-45\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, while the increased total conductance reduces input resistance and attenuates coincident EPSPs, keeping $V_m$ subthreshold.**\n**Correct**. This option accurately describes all aspects derived from first principles. The direction of current flow (chloride efflux) and its effect on membrane potential (depolarization toward $-45\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) are correct. The consequence of the increased conductance (reduced input resistance and attenuation of EPSPs, i.e., shunting) is correct. The overall effect is correctly identified as inhibitory because it keeps the membrane potential subthreshold and reduces the efficacy of excitatory inputs.\n\nC. **Purely depolarizing excitation: a large inward current drives $V_m$ beyond $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ because $V_m-E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}>0$, so GlyR activation reliably triggers action potentials.**\n**Incorrect**. This option contains multiple errors. First, the condition $V_m - E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} > 0$ is false; it is negative. Second, the resulting depolarization is small, moving the potential to $-48.33\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, which is far from the threshold of $-35\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The effect is therefore not excitatory; it is inhibitory.\n\nD. **No net effect: there is no current through GlyR because $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ is equal to $V_m$, so neither $V_m$ nor EPSP amplitude changes during activation.**\n**Incorrect**. The premise that $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ is equal to $V_m$ is false; $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = -45\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ is not equal to $V_m = -50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. There is a non-zero driving force, so a current will flow, and the membrane potential will change. Furthermore, the opening of any conductance, even one with a reversal potential equal to $V_m$, would still increase total conductance, decrease input resistance, and cause a shunting effect on EPSPs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2715410"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the cellular to the molecular level, we now examine how agonist binding leads to channel opening.

Note that $K_{A}$ is the reciprocal of the binding association constant ($K_{A} = k_{-1}/k_1$), and $E$ is the ratio of the gating rate constants ($E = \\beta/\\alpha$, where $\\beta$ is the opening rate and $\\alpha$ is the closing rate).\n\n1) Derivation of the equilibrium open probability $P_{\\mathrm{o}}$.\nThe open probability, $P_{\\mathrm{o}}$, is defined as the fraction of the total number of receptors that are in the open state, $AR^{*}$. The total concentration of receptors, $[R]_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is the sum of the concentrations of all possible states.\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{o}} = \\frac{[AR^{*}]}{[R]_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{[AR^{*}]}{[R] + [AR] + [AR^{*}]} $$\nTo express $P_{\\mathrm{o}}$ as a function of the agonist concentration $[A]$ and the constants $K_{A}$ and $E$, we must express all concentrations in the denominator in terms of a single state and the given parameters. It is convenient to express $[R]$ and $[AR^{*}]$ in terms of $[AR]$.\nFrom the definition of the gating equilibrium constant, $E = \\frac{[AR^{*}]}{[AR]}$, we have:\n$$ [AR^{*}] = E \\cdot [AR] $$\nFrom the definition of the binding dissociation constant, $K_{A} = \\frac{[R][A]}{[AR]}$, we can solve for $[R]$:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{K_{A}[AR]}{[A]} $$\nNow, substitute these expressions back into the equation for $P_{\\mathrm{o}}$:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{o}} = \\frac{E \\cdot [AR]}{\\frac{K_{A}[AR]}{[A]} + [AR] + E \\cdot [AR]} $$\nThe term $[AR]$ is common to all terms in the denominator and can be factored out. It subsequently cancels with the $[AR]$ term in the numerator.\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{o}} = \\frac{E \\cdot [AR]}{[AR] \\left( \\frac{K_{A}}{[A]} + 1 + E \\right)} = \\frac{E}{\\frac{K_{A}}{[A]} + 1 + E} $$\nThis expression can be algebraically rearranged by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $[A]$ to yield a form that is common in pharmacology literature:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{o}}([A]; K_{A}, E) = \\frac{E[A]}{K_{A} + [A] + E[A]} = \\frac{E[A]}{K_{A} + (1+E)[A]} $$\nThis is the required expression for the equilibrium open probability as a function of $[A]$, $K_{A}$, and $E$.\n\n2) Maximum open probability $P_{\\mathrm{o}}^{\\max}$ and the nature of partial agonism.\nThe maximum open probability, $P_{\\mathrm{o}}^{\\max}$, is achieved at a saturating concentration of the agonist, i.e., in the limit where $[A] \\rightarrow \\infty$. We evaluate this limit using the derived expression for $P_{\\mathrm{o}}$:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{o}}^{\\max} = \\lim_{[A] \\to \\infty} P_{\\mathrm{o}}([A]) = \\lim_{[A] \\to \\infty} \\frac{E[A]}{K_{A} + (1+E)[A]} $$\nTo evaluate the limit, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by $[A]$:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{o}}^{\\max} = \\lim_{[A] \\to \\infty} \\frac{E}{\\frac{K_{A}}{[A]} + (1+E)} $$\nAs $[A] \\rightarrow \\infty$, the term $\\frac{K_{A}}{[A]}$ approaches $0$. The expression thus simplifies to:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{o}}^{\\max} = \\frac{E}{1+E} $$\nThis result is fundamental. It demonstrates that the maximum achievable open probability depends solely on the gating equilibrium constant, $E$, which quantifies the efficacy of the agonist to induce channel opening *after* it has bound to the receptor. $P_{\\mathrm{o}}^{\\max}$ is independent of the binding affinity, $K_{A}$.\n\nA partial agonist is defined as a ligand that, even at saturating concentrations, fails to produce the full response elicited by a full agonist. In the context of this model, the \"response\" is the open probability. A full agonist, like glycine, is characterized by a high efficacy, meaning a large value for $E$. A partial agonist is characterized by a lower efficacy, meaning a smaller value for $E$.\nAccording to the expression $P_{\\mathrm{o}}^{\\max} = \\frac{E}{1+E}$, a lower value of $E$ directly results in a lower value of $P_{\\mathrm{o}}^{\\max}$. For example, if a full agonist has $E \\gg 1$, its $P_{\\mathrm{o}}^{\\max}$ approaches $1$. If a partial agonist has $E \\approx 1$ or $E < 1$, its $P_{\\mathrm{o}}^{\\max}$ will be significantly less than $1$. Therefore, two agonists can have identical binding affinities (same $K_{A}$), but if one has a substantially reduced gating equilibrium constant ($E$), it will function as a partial agonist relative to the other because its maximum possible effect ($P_{\\mathrm{o}}^{\\max}$) is intrinsically limited by its lower efficacy in promoting the $AR \\rightarrow AR^{*}$ conformational change.\n\n3) Calculation of the current ratio.\nThe macroscopic current $I$ is given by $I = N \\gamma (V_{m} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}) P_{\\mathrm{o}}$. The maximum current, $I_{\\max}$, is obtained at saturating agonist concentration, where $P_{\\mathrm{o}} = P_{\\mathrm{o}}^{\\max} = \\frac{E}{1+E}$.\nTherefore, the general expression for maximum current is:\n$$ I_{\\max} = N \\gamma (V_{m} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}) \\frac{E}{1+E} $$\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $\\frac{I_{\\max,\\mathrm{par}}}{I_{\\max,\\mathrm{gly}}}$ for a partial agonist (par) and glycine (gly). The experimental conditions ($N$, $\\gamma$, $V_{m}$, $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$) are identical for both measurements.\nWriting the expressions for the maximum currents for each agonist:\n$$ I_{\\max,\\mathrm{gly}} = N \\gamma (V_{m} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}) \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{gly}}}{1+E_{\\mathrm{gly}}} $$\n$$ I_{\\max,\\mathrm{par}} = N \\gamma (V_{m} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}) \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{par}}}{1+E_{\\mathrm{par}}} $$\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\max,\\mathrm{par}}}{I_{\\max,\\mathrm{gly}}} = \\frac{N \\gamma (V_{m} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}) \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{par}}}{1+E_{\\mathrm{par}}}}{N \\gamma (V_{m} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}) \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{gly}}}{1+E_{\\mathrm{gly}}}} $$\nThe pre-factor $N \\gamma (V_{m} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$ cancels, leaving a ratio of the maximum open probabilities:\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\max,\\mathrm{par}}}{I_{\\max,\\mathrm{gly}}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{o}, \\mathrm{par}}^{\\max}}{P_{\\mathrm{o}, \\mathrm{gly}}^{\\max}} = \\frac{\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{par}}}{1+E_{\\mathrm{par}}}}{\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{gly}}}{1+E_{\\mathrm{gly}}}} $$\nWe are given the values $E_{\\mathrm{gly}} = 50$ and $E_{\\mathrm{par}} = 2$. Substituting these values into the expression:\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\max,\\mathrm{par}}}{I_{\\max,\\mathrm{gly}}} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{1+2}}{\\frac{50}{1+50}} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3}}{\\frac{50}{51}} $$\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\max,\\mathrm{par}}}{I_{\\max,\\mathrm{gly}}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{51}{50} = \\frac{102}{150} = \\frac{17}{25} $$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$$ \\frac{17}{25} = 0.68 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be a unitless decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ 0.6800 $$\nThe other provided numerical values ($N = 1.0 \\times 10^{3}$, $\\gamma = 30\\,\\mathrm{pS}$, $V_{m} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) were not necessary for the calculation of this specific ratio, as is often the case in problems designed to test conceptual understanding of underlying principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6800}$$", "id": "2715423"}]}
