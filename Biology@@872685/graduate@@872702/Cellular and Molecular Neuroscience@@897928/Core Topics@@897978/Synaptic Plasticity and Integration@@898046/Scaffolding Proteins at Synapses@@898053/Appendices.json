In this framework, each protein is modeled as a flexible polymer with discrete stickers (sites that can form reversible pairwise bonds) connected by entropic spacers. Assume the following experimentally supported, well-tested facts and idealizations as the starting point: (i) Homer family long isoforms (for example, Homer1b/c) assemble into coiled-coil oligomers that can be dimeric or tetrameric, endowing them with either $f_{\\mathrm{H}}=2$ or $f_{\\mathrm{H}}=4$ EVH1 stickers; (ii) Shank provides an effective average of $f_{\\mathrm{S}}=3$ Homer-binding stickers per Shank molecule in the PSD milieu due to a combination of multiple proline-rich motifs and Shank self-association; (iii) the microscopic binding of a Homer EVH1 sticker to a Shank sticker is independent and equivalent across sites and follows the law of mass action with dissociation constant $K_{d}$ (units of concentration), so that the equilibrium sticker occupancy on one side increases with the concentration of partner stickers; and (iv) phase separation of such associative polymers at fixed temperature emerges when reversible inter-sticker bonds generate a percolated network (gel) whose formation competes with mixing entropy.\n\nYou are given a mixture in which the total concentration of Shank stickers available to bind Homer, denoted $c_{\\mathrm{S}}$, is $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, and the dissociation constant for a single Homer–Shank sticker pair is $K_{d}=5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. Treat the sticker occupancy fraction $p$ for Homer–Shank pairs using the law of mass action in the dilute-sticker limit, and use classical criteria for network percolation in step-growth associative networks to reason about the gel point in a binary $A$–$B$ network with functionalities $f_{\\mathrm{H}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{S}}$ and fractional conversion $p$. Ignore other interactions for the quantitative estimates, but when interpreting the role of GKAP, take into account that GKAP binds Shank and PSD-95 with multiple weak, reversible contacts that can increase overall network connectivity without changing Homer–Shank affinity.\n\nWhich option best justifies, from first principles, how increasing Homer valency from dimer to tetramer promotes PSD phase separation with Shank (and how GKAP modulates this), under the conditions above?\n\n- A. Using the law of mass action, the sticker occupancy is $p=\\dfrac{c_{\\mathrm{S}}}{c_{\\mathrm{S}}+K_{d}}=\\dfrac{10}{10+5}=\\dfrac{2}{3}$. For a binary associative network, the gel point is crossed when the product of branching probabilities exceeds unity, which for random $A$–$B$ bonding implies a critical occupancy $p_{c}$ that decreases with increasing functionalities. With $f_{\\mathrm{S}}=3$, a Homer dimer has a higher $p_{c}$ than a Homer tetramer, so at $p=\\dfrac{2}{3}$ a tetrameric Homer–Shank network percolates while a dimeric network does not. The corresponding critical partner-sticker concentrations satisfy $c^{*}=K_{d}\\,\\dfrac{p_{c}}{1-p_{c}}$, yielding $c^{*}_{\\text{dimer}}\\approx 12\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ versus $c^{*}_{\\text{tetramer}}\\approx 3.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ for $K_{d}=5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. Thus, tetramerization lowers the concentration threshold for network formation and phase separation. GKAP, by adding orthogonal reversible connections to Shank and PSD-95, raises the average network functionality and lowers $p_{c}$ and $c^{*}$ further without altering $K_{d}$ for Homer–Shank stickers.\n\n- B.

Transient sticker–sticker interactions cannot, by themselves, drive a phase transition; adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-consuming activity is required to overcome mixing entropy, so Homer tetramerization has no thermodynamic effect on phase separation in this passive system.\n\n- D. GKAP caps Shank binding sites and reduces its effective functionality, so adding GKAP in the Homer–Shank mixture always increases the critical occupancy $p_{c}$; therefore, Homer tetramers cannot promote phase separation in the presence of GKAP as effectively as dimers.", "solution": "### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks to justify how increasing Homer valency from $f_{\\mathrm{H}}=2$ to $f_{\\mathrm{H}}=4$ promotes phase separation with Shank, which has a functionality of $f_{\\mathrm{S}}=3$. The framework is that of percolation in a binary associative network of A-type molecules (Homer) and B-type molecules (Shank). Phase separation is assumed to occur upon network percolation (gelation).\n\nThe condition for gelation in a stoichiometric mixture of A and B monomers with functionalities $f_{A}$ and $f_{B}$ is given by the Flory-Stockmayer theory. The network percolates when the fraction of formed bonds, $p$, exceeds a critical threshold, $p_c$. This threshold is determined by the functionalities:\n$$p_c = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(f_A - 1)(f_B - 1)}}$$\nWe must calculate this critical occupancy for the two cases of Homer valency. In both cases, Shank's functionality is $f_{\\mathrm{S}}=3$.\n\n**Case 1: Dimeric Homer ($f_{\\mathrm{H}}=2$)**\nHere, $f_A = f_{\\mathrm{H}} = 2$ and $f_B = f_{\\mathrm{S}} = 3$. The critical occupancy is:\n$$p_{c, \\text{dimer}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(2 - 1)(3 - 1)}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 \\times 2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.707$$\n\n**Case 2: Tetrameric Homer ($f_{\\mathrm{H}}=4$)**\nHere, $f_A = f_{\\mathrm{H}} = 4$ and $f_B = f_{\\mathrm{S}} = 3$. The critical occupancy is:\n$$p_{c, \\text{tetra}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(4 - 1)(3 - 1)}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3 \\times 2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\approx 0.408$$\nThis calculation demonstrates that increasing the valency of Homer from $2$ to $4$ significantly lowers the critical sticker occupancy required for network percolation.\n\nNext, we must determine the actual sticker occupancy, $p$, under the given conditions: a total Shank sticker concentration $c_{\\mathrm{S}} = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and a dissociation constant $K_{d} = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. The problem specifies using the law of mass action in the dilute-sticker limit. A common and useful simplification in this limit, particularly when one binding partner's free concentration is approximated by its total concentration, leads to a Michaelis-Menten-like binding equation. This is the approach specified in Option A. Let us assume the concentration of Homer stickers is stoichiometrically matched to Shank stickers, and the occupancy $p$ of a sticker of one type is determined by the total concentration of the partner sticker type, $c_{\\text{partner}}$.\n$$p = \\frac{c_{\\text{partner}}}{c_{\\text{partner}} + K_d}$$\nAssuming a stoichiometric mixture, $c_{\\text{partner}} = c_{\\mathrm{S}} = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. The sticker occupancy fraction is:\n$$p = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{S}}}{c_{\\mathrm{S}} + K_d} = \\frac{10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{10}{15} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.667$$\n\nNow, we compare the actual occupancy $p$ with the critical occupancies $p_c$:\n-   For the dimeric Homer system: $p \\approx 0.667$ is less than $p_{c, \\text{dimer}} \\approx 0.707$. Thus, $p < p_c$, and the network does **not** percolate.\n-   For the tetrameric Homer system: $p \\approx 0.667$ is greater than $p_{c, \\text{tetra}} \\approx 0.408$. Thus, $p > p_c$, and the network **does** percolate.\n\nThis result proves that, under the given conditions, switching from dimeric to tetrameric Homer is sufficient to drive the system across the percolation threshold, thereby promoting phase separation.\n\nWe can also calculate the critical sticker concentration, $c^*$, required to reach the percolation threshold $p_c$. Rearranging the occupancy equation gives $c = K_d \\frac{p}{1-p}$. Thus, $c^* = K_d \\frac{p_c}{1-p_c}$.\n-   For dimeric Homer: $c^*_{\\text{dimer}} = (5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) \\frac{1/\\sqrt{2}}{1-1/\\sqrt{2}} = 5 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}-1} = 5(\\sqrt{2}+1) \\approx 12.07\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n-   For tetrameric Homer: $c^*_{\\text{tetramer}} = (5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) \\frac{1/\\sqrt{6}}{1-1/\\sqrt{6}} = 5 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}-1} \\approx 3.45\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nSince the operating concentration is $c_{\\mathrm{S}} = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, we have $c_{\\mathrm{S}} < c^*_{\\text{dimer}}$ but $c_{\\mathrm{S}} > c^*_{\\text{tetramer}}$, confirming our conclusion. Tetramerization lowers the concentration threshold for phase separation.\n\nFinally, we consider the role of GKAP. The problem states that GKAP \"increase[s] overall network connectivity\". In the context of percolation theory, adding a multivalent crosslinker like GKAP, which connects Shank molecules to each other (via PSD-95 bridges, for example), increases the average functionality of the nodes in the network. An increase in average functionality systematically lowers the critical occupancy $p_c$ required for gelation. This means that in the presence of GKAP, the network will percolate at an even lower Homer-Shank bond occupancy, or, equivalently, a lower concentration of stickers. GKAP's effect is orthogonal to Homer-Shank binding, as its presence does not alter their intrinsic $K_d$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n-   **A**: This option correctly calculates the sticker occupancy $p=2/3$ based on the simplified model. It correctly applies the Flory-Stockmayer formula for $p_c$ for both dimer and tetramer cases, concluding that only the tetramer system percolates at the given $p$. The calculation of critical concentrations $c^*_{\\text{dimer}} \\approx 12\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $c^*_{\\text{tetramer}} \\approx 3.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ is correct within this model and supports the conclusion. The interpretation of GKAP's role as increasing network functionality and further lowering $p_c$ and $c^*$ is also correct and consistent with the problem statement.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **B**: This option asserts that percolation occurs simply because $p=2/3 > 1/2$. The threshold $p_c = 1/2$ is not a general result; it applies only to specific network topologies (e.g., $f_A=f_B=3$), not to the ones considered here. As calculated, for the dimer case ($f_H=2, f_S=3$), $p_c = 1/\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.707 > 2/3$. The premise is flawed and the conclusion that both systems percolate is false.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C**: This option incorrectly claims that transient sticker interactions cannot drive phase separation and that ATP-dependent activity is required. This contradicts the fundamental premise of equilibrium liquid-liquid phase separation in biology, which is a passive thermodynamic process driven by the balance of favorable binding interactions against the unfavorable entropy of demixing. The problem is explicitly framed in this equilibrium context.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D**: This option misinterprets the role of GKAP. It suggests GKAP \"caps\" Shank sites, reducing functionality. The problem statement explicitly describes GKAP as a component that \"increase[s] overall network connectivity,\" which implies a crosslinking, not a capping, function. A crosslinking function increases average network valency and *lowers* the percolation threshold $p_c$, promoting phase separation, which is the opposite of the effect described in this option.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2750269"}]}
