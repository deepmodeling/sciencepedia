## Introduction
For decades, the neuron was often simplified to an "integrate-and-fire" device, with dendrites acting as passive wires that merely collect and funnel synaptic signals to the soma. However, this view fails to account for the immense computational power of the brain. The true complexity of neural processing lies hidden within the dendritic arbor, which functions as a sophisticated, active computational engine. This article series delves into the biophysical underpinnings of [dendritic computation](@entry_id:154049), moving beyond the passive model to reveal how single neurons perform complex operations essential for learning, memory, and cognition.

This exploration is structured into three chapters. The first, **Principles and Mechanisms**, will dissect the fundamental electrical events that govern dendritic activity. We will examine the [back-propagating action potential](@entry_id:170729) (bAP) as a message from the soma to the dendrites and explore the diverse family of locally generated [dendritic spikes](@entry_id:165333). The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, will demonstrate how these mechanisms are harnessed to implement [synaptic plasticity](@entry_id:137631) rules, perform logical operations, and contribute to complex information processing, while also considering how their dysfunction leads to neurological disease. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** chapter provides a set of conceptual problems that will allow you to apply these principles and solidify your quantitative understanding of dendritic function. We begin by uncovering the core principles that transform [dendrites](@entry_id:159503) from passive conduits into dynamic computational devices.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The previous chapter introduced the concept that [dendrites](@entry_id:159503) are not merely passive conduits for synaptic signals but are active computational devices. This chapter delves into the biophysical principles and mechanisms that endow dendrites with these remarkable capabilities. We will first explore the nature of the [back-propagating action potential](@entry_id:170729) (bAP) as a [fundamental unit](@entry_id:180485) of communication from the soma to the [dendrites](@entry_id:159503). We will then examine the diverse family of locally generated [dendritic spikes](@entry_id:165333). Finally, we will synthesize these concepts to understand how dendrites perform complex computations, such as [coincidence detection](@entry_id:189579) and branch-specific information processing.

### The Back-Propagating Action Potential: An Active Somatodendritic Signal

The canonical view of [neuronal signaling](@entry_id:176759) involves the orthodromic propagation of an action potential from the [axon initial segment](@entry_id:150839) (AIS) down the axon to its terminals. However, the action potential initiated at the soma or AIS also invades the dendritic arbor in the reverse or retrograde direction. This phenomenon gives rise to the **[back-propagating action potential](@entry_id:170729) (bAP)**.

From a biophysical perspective, the initiation of a somatic action potential creates a large, transient depolarization at the soma ($x=0$). This makes the soma a **[current source](@entry_id:275668)** relative to the adjacent, more hyperpolarized proximal dendrite, which acts as a **current sink**. This [potential gradient](@entry_id:261486) drives an axial current into the dendrite, initiating the bAP's journey [@problem_id:2707120].

To appreciate the active nature of this process, it is instructive to first consider what would happen in a purely passive dendritic cable. The propagation of voltage in such a structure is governed by [passive cable theory](@entry_id:193060). Two key parameters are the [membrane time constant](@entry_id:168069), $\tau_m = R_m C_m$, and the [space constant](@entry_id:193491), $\lambda = \sqrt{r_m/r_a}$, where $R_m$ and $C_m$ are the [specific membrane resistance](@entry_id:166665) and capacitance, and $r_m$ and $r_a$ are the membrane and [axial resistance](@entry_id:177656) per unit length, respectively. For a cylindrical dendrite of diameter $d$ and axial resistivity $R_a$, the [space constant](@entry_id:193491) can be expressed as $\lambda = \sqrt{\frac{R_m d}{4 R_a}}$.

A purely passive model predicts that the bAP amplitude should decay substantially with distance. For example, in a typical basal dendrite with $d = 2\,\mu\mathrm{m}$, $R_m = 10\,\mathrm{k}\Omega\cdot\mathrm{cm}^2$, and $R_a = 150\,\Omega\cdot\mathrm{cm}$, the [space constant](@entry_id:193491) $\lambda$ is approximately $577\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ [@problem_id:2707145]. For a steady-state voltage, this implies that at a distance of $300\,\mu\mathrm{m}$, the amplitude would be attenuated to $\exp(-300/577) \approx 0.59$ of its original value. However, an action potential is a very rapid transient. The dendritic membrane acts as a **low-pass filter**, meaning it attenuates high-frequency components of a signal more severely than low-frequency components. The fast upstroke of an action potential contains significant high-frequency power, so its peak amplitude will be attenuated far more than the steady-state estimate suggests [@problem_id:2707145].

Experimental recordings, however, reveal that bAP amplitudes are significantly larger than predicted by passive models. The reason for this discrepancy is that [dendrites](@entry_id:159503) are not passive; they are endowed with a variety of **[voltage-gated ion channels](@entry_id:175526)**. Crucially, [dendrites](@entry_id:159503) of most neurons, including cortical pyramidal cells, express voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs), the same channels responsible for the rising phase of the axonal action potential [@problem_id:2707120]. As the passively spreading wave of [depolarization](@entry_id:156483) from the soma invades the dendrite, it can reach the threshold to activate these local VGSCs. The resulting influx of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ ions provides a regenerative, inward current that actively boosts the voltage signal, counteracting passive decay and enabling the bAP to propagate actively for hundreds of micrometers into the dendritic tree [@problem_id:2707145].

### The Dendritic Ion Channel Landscape and bAP Attenuation

The extent to which a bAP successfully invades the dendritic tree is not uniform; it is exquisitely shaped by the non-uniform [spatial distribution](@entry_id:188271) of various [ion channels](@entry_id:144262). The density and type of channels can vary dramatically with distance from the soma, creating a complex landscape of local excitability [@problem_id:2707159].

*   **Voltage-gated Sodium Channels ($\mathrm{Na_v}$)**: While present, the density of VGSCs typically decreases with distance from the soma along the main apical trunk of pyramidal neurons. This gradient means that the regenerative capacity to boost the bAP is strongest proximally and weakens distally, contributing to a natural decrement in bAP amplitude with distance.

*   **A-type Potassium Channels ($\mathrm{K_A}$)**: In contrast, the density of transient, A-type potassium channels often increases with distance from the soma. These channels activate upon [depolarization](@entry_id:156483) and provide a rapid, outward $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ current. This outward current acts as a voltage-dependent **shunt**, counteracting the depolarizing influence of the bAP, accelerating its [repolarization](@entry_id:150957), and thus contributing significantly to its attenuation. Blocking these channels pharmacologically can dramatically increase the amplitude and spatial extent of bAPs, especially in distal dendrites [@problem_id:2707120] [@problem_id:2707159].

*   **Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic Nucleotide-gated (HCN) Channels**: Responsible for the current $I_h$, these channels are also typically expressed in an increasing gradient toward distal [dendrites](@entry_id:159503). At typical resting and [subthreshold potentials](@entry_id:195783), these channels are partially open, contributing a depolarizing "leak" current and, importantly, lowering the local membrane resistance. This decrease in resistance reduces the local [space constant](@entry_id:193491) $\lambda$, thereby increasing the attenuation of voltage signals like the bAP.

*   **Voltage-gated Calcium Channels ($\mathrm{Ca_v}$)** and **Calcium-activated Potassium (SK) Channels**: These channels are often concentrated in dendritic "hot spots," such as the main apical bifurcation and the distal tuft. While the bAP itself may be insufficient to strongly activate high-threshold $\mathrm{Ca_v}$ channels, its arrival provides a critical [depolarization](@entry_id:156483) that can interact with synaptic inputs to trigger local regenerative events, which we will discuss later. SK channels, activated by the subsequent rise in [intracellular calcium](@entry_id:163147), provide a powerful [negative feedback](@entry_id:138619) signal, hyperpolarizing the membrane and limiting excitability.

The combination of a decreasing density of inward current-carrying $\mathrm{Na_v}$ channels and an increasing density of outward and shunting current-carrying $\mathrm{K_A}$ and HCN channels creates a situation where bAP amplitude robustly attenuates with distance from the soma.

### Frequency-Dependent Regulation of bAP Propagation

The propagation of bAPs is not static but is highly dynamic and depends on the frequency of somatic firing. At low frequencies, bAPs may reliably invade the dendritic tree. However, as the firing frequency increases, bAPs often fail to propagate into the distal dendrites. This phenomenon can be understood by considering the cumulative kinetics of the underlying ion channels.

During a high-frequency train of bAPs, two primary processes conspire to cause propagation failure [@problem_id:2707175] [@problem_id:2707201]. First, there is **cumulative inactivation of [sodium channels](@entry_id:202769)**. After opening during a spike, VGSCs enter a non-conducting, inactivated state. They require a certain amount of time, governed by a [time constant](@entry_id:267377) $\tau_h$, to recover from inactivation and become available to open again. If the inter-spike interval is shorter than $\tau_h$, recovery is incomplete. With each successive spike in a train, the fraction of inactivated channels accumulates, progressively reducing the available inward current for regeneration.

Second, there can be **cumulative activation of [potassium channels](@entry_id:174108)**. Slow-activating or slow-inactivating [potassium channels](@entry_id:174108) can build up their activation state over the course of a train, leading to an increase in the total outward current that opposes depolarization.

The **critical frequency** for bAP propagation is defined as the frequency above which the diminishing regenerative inward current (due to $\mathrm{Na_v}$ inactivation) can no longer overcome the combined passive leak and active outward currents (such as those from $\mathrm{K_A}$ channels) [@problem_id:2707201]. Above this frequency, active propagation fails, and the bAP is rapidly extinguished in the distal [dendrites](@entry_id:159503). This mechanism allows the dendritic tree to be selectively informed about the neuron's firing rate, with high-frequency bursts being largely filtered out from the distal compartments.

### Dendritic Spikes: Local Regenerative Events

While bAPs represent a global signal broadcast from the soma, [dendrites](@entry_id:159503) can also generate their own action potentials, or **[dendritic spikes](@entry_id:165333)**, locally. These are all-or-none regenerative events initiated within the dendritic tree, typically by the summation of synaptic inputs. They represent a fundamental form of nonlinear integration and come in several distinct flavors, distinguished by their underlying ionic mechanisms, kinetics, and [pharmacology](@entry_id:142411).

#### Dendritic Sodium Spikes

A dendritic **sodium spike** is a fast, regenerative event mediated by dendritic VGSCs. When a spatially clustered and temporally synchronous group of excitatory synapses provides sufficient local depolarization to cross the activation threshold of dendritic VGSCs, a local action potential can be initiated [@problem_id:2707098]. These spikes are characteristically fast, with a rapid rate of rise ($\mathrm{d}V/\mathrm{d}t$), and are blocked by the VGSC blocker [tetrodotoxin](@entry_id:169263) (TTX).

However, due to the lower density of VGSCs in [dendrites](@entry_id:159503) compared to the AIS, the $\mathrm{d}V/\mathrm{d}t$ of a dendritic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ spike is typically lower than that of a somatic action potential. Furthermore, their propagation can be unreliable. As a [dendritic spike](@entry_id:166335) propagates from a thin branch towards the much larger soma, it encounters a severe **[impedance mismatch](@entry_id:261346)**. The large surface area of the soma acts as a massive current sink, often causing the spike's amplitude to drop below the threshold for further propagation, leading to its failure to invade the soma [@problem_id:2707098]. This confinement makes dendritic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ spikes well-suited for computations that are specific to a single dendritic branch.

#### Dendritic Calcium Spikes and Plateau Potentials

Dendritic **calcium spikes** are distinct events mediated by voltage-gated calcium channels ($\mathrm{Ca_v}$). They are typically much slower and broader than $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ spikes, often manifesting as a sustained **plateau potential** lasting tens to hundreds of milliseconds [@problem_id:2707098] [@problem_id:2707117]. Their generation involves a sophisticated interplay of different channel subtypes:

1.  **Initiation**: Low-voltage-activated (LVA or T-type) $\mathrm{Ca_v}$ channels, which open at relatively hyperpolarized potentials, can provide the initial depolarizing current to "bootstrap" the event.
2.  **Plateau Generation**: The large, sustained [depolarization](@entry_id:156483) is primarily driven by the influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ through high-voltage-activated (HVA or L-type) $\mathrm{Ca_v}$ channels. These channels require strong depolarization to open and, critically, they inactivate very slowly, allowing for a prolonged inward current that maintains the plateau.
3.  **Termination**: The large influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ during the plateau activates [calcium-activated potassium channels](@entry_id:190529) (e.g., SK channels). The resulting outward $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ current provides a powerful negative feedback that repolarizes the membrane, terminates the plateau, and often produces a characteristic afterhyperpolarization (AHP).

Because they are mediated by $\mathrm{Ca_v}$ channels, these events are insensitive to TTX but can be blocked by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ [channel blockers](@entry_id:176993) like cadmium or nimodipine [@problem_id:2707117].

#### NMDA Spikes

A third class of local regenerative event is the **NMDA spike**, mediated by the unique properties of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The NMDA receptor is both ligand-gated and voltage-gated. It requires the binding of glutamate to open, but at resting membrane potentials, its pore is blocked by magnesium ions ($\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$). This block is only relieved when the membrane is sufficiently depolarized.

An NMDA spike is generated through a positive feedback loop intrinsic to the receptor itself. Spatially clustered synaptic input provides both glutamate and an initial [depolarization](@entry_id:156483) via AMPA receptors. This [depolarization](@entry_id:156483) begins to unblock NMDA receptors, allowing cation influx that causes further [depolarization](@entry_id:156483), which in turn unblocks more NMDA receptors. This regenerative cycle can produce a sustained local plateau potential lasting 50-100 ms [@problem_id:2707091]. NMDA spikes are uniquely characterized by their dependence on clustered synaptic glutamate (abolished by NMDA receptor antagonists like APV), their insensitivity to TTX, and their sensitivity to extracellular $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ levels.

### Dendritic Computation: Integration, Plasticity, and Branch Specificity

The rich repertoire of active events—bAPs and various [dendritic spikes](@entry_id:165333)—transforms dendrites into powerful computational structures capable of far more than simple summation.

#### Coincidence Detection and Synaptic Plasticity

The bAP plays a crucial role as a "messenger" signal from the soma that informs synapses about the neuron's output. This enables a fundamental mechanism for learning: **dendritic [coincidence detection](@entry_id:189579)**. The NMDA receptor acts as a molecular [coincidence detector](@entry_id:169622). It requires two events to occur in a narrow time window for significant activation: presynaptic glutamate release (signaling input) and postsynaptic depolarization (signaling output, often provided by a bAP).

When an EPSP immediately precedes a bAP ("pre-before-post" timing), the depolarization from the bAP arrives at the synapse just in time to relieve the $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ block of NMDA receptors that are already bound with glutamate. This results in a **supralinear influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$** into the [dendritic spine](@entry_id:174933) [@problem_id:2707095]. This large, local $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ transient is a critical instructive signal that can trigger downstream biochemical cascades (e.g., involving CaMKII) to induce [long-term potentiation](@entry_id:139004) (LTP), thereby strengthening the synapse. This mechanism is the biophysical underpinning of [spike-timing-dependent plasticity](@entry_id:152912) (STDP) and Hebbian learning.

#### Feature Binding and Branch-Specific Computation

Dendritic spikes provide a mechanism for a higher-order form of computation. When multiple synapses on a single dendritic branch are activated synchronously, their summed [depolarization](@entry_id:156483) can trigger a local [dendritic spike](@entry_id:166335) ($\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, or NMDA). This all-or-none event signifies that a specific combination of inputs has occurred. By generating a large local [depolarization](@entry_id:156483) and subsequent $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx, the [dendritic spike](@entry_id:166335) can induce LTP at all participating synapses, effectively "binding" this group of inputs into a single functional unit or "feature detector" [@problem_id:2707095].

Perhaps the most profound computational concept is that of **branch-specific computation**. This is the ability of an individual dendritic branch to act as an independent computational subunit, performing nonlinear operations on its inputs *without necessarily causing the neuron to fire a somatic action potential*. The definitive demonstration of this principle involves experiments where somatic spiking is pharmacologically blocked (e.g., by applying TTX to the AIS). Under these conditions, it can be shown that strong, clustered synaptic activation of a single branch can still evoke a local, nonlinear [dendritic spike](@entry_id:166335) or plateau potential that remains confined to that branch [@problem_id:2707130]. This proves that the dendritic branch can compute a local "decision" (i.e., generate a spike) based on its inputs, a decision that may or may not be passed on to influence the global output of the neuron. This endows the neuron with a two-layer structure: a first layer of local computations in the dendrites, followed by a second layer of global integration at the soma.
