The analysis will proceed from first principles of current conservation and Ohm's law under the given approximations.\n\nFirst, we must define the relevant electrical parameters per unit length of the cable. The dendrite is modeled as a cylinder of diameter $d$.\n\nThe membrane resistance per unit length, $r_m$, is the specific membrane resistance $R_m$ (units of $\\Omega \\cdot \\text{area}$) divided by the circumference of the cylinder, $\\pi d$.\n$$\nr_m = \\frac{R_m}{\\pi d}\n$$\nThe units of $r_m$ are $\\Omega \\cdot \\text{length}$.

A lower $r_a$ indicates better conduction of current along the dendritic core.\n\nNow, consider a small segment of the cable of length $dx$ located at position $x$. Let $V(x)$ be the membrane potential relative to rest, $i_a(x)$ be the axial current flowing in the positive $x$ direction, and $i_m(x)$ be the membrane current density (current per unit length) leaking out of the cable.\n\nBy Ohm's law, the voltage drop along the axial resistor $r_a dx$ is given by:\n$$\ndV = V(x+dx) - V(x) = -i_a(x) (r_a dx)\n$$\nIn the limit as $dx \\to 0$, this becomes a differential relationship:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dx} = -i_a r_a \\quad \\implies \\quad i_a(x) = -\\frac{1}{r_a} \\frac{dV}{dx}\n$$\n\nFor current conservation, the change in axial current over the segment $dx$ must be equal to the current that leaves through the membrane.\n$$\ndi_a = i_a(x+dx) - i_a(x) = -i_m(x) dx\n$$\nIn the limit as $dx \\to 0$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{di_a}{dx} = -i_m(x)\n$$\nThe problem states that the membrane is ohmic and linearized around rest, so the membrane current density $i_m$ is directly proportional to the voltage $V(x)$ across the membrane, with the proportionality constant being $1/r_m$.\n$$\ni_m(x) = \\frac{V(x)}{r_m}\n$$\nThe problem also specifies steady-state conditions, so any capacitive currents are zero.\n\nNow we combine these equations. We differentiate the expression for $i_a(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{di_a}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -\\frac{1}{r_a} \\frac{dV}{dx} \\right) = -\\frac{1}{r_a} \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $di_a/dx$:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{r_a} \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = -i_m(x)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $i_m(x)$:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{r_a} \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = -\\frac{V(x)}{r_m}\n$$\nRearranging gives the steady-state cable equation:\n$$\n\\frac{r_m}{r_a} \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} - V(x) = 0\n$$\nWe define the space constant, or length constant, $\\lambda$, such that $\\lambda^2 = r_m / r_a$.

Substituting the expressions for $r_m$ and $r_a$:\n$$\n\\lambda^2 = \\frac{r_m}{r_a} = \\frac{R_m / (\\pi d)}{4 R_a / (\\pi d^2)} = \\frac{R_m}{\\pi d} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4 R_a} = \\frac{R_m d}{4 R_a}\n$$\nTherefore, the space constant is:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m d}{4 R_a}}\n$$\n\nThe general solution to the second-order ordinary differential equation $\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} V(x) = 0$ is:\n$$\nV(x) = A \\exp(-x/\\lambda) + B \\exp(x/\\lambda)\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants determined by boundary conditions. The problem states the dendrite is semi-infinite, meaning it extends from $x=0$ to $x \\to \\infty$. For a biologically plausible solution, the voltage must remain bounded as $x \\to \\infty$. The term $\\exp(x/\\lambda)$ grows without bound as $x \\to \\infty$, so its coefficient must be zero. This requires $B=0$. The solution thus simplifies to:\n$$\nV(x) = A \\exp(-x/\\lambda)\n$$\nThe constant $A$ is determined by the condition at the proximal end, $x=0$. We are given that the voltage at this point is a fixed value, which we denote as $V(0)$.\n$$\nV(0) = A \\exp(0) = A\n$$\nThus, the specific solution for the voltage along a semi-infinite cable is:\n$$\nV(x) = V(0) \\exp(-x/\\lambda)\n$$\n\nThe attenuation ratio $V(x)/V(0)$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{V(x)}{V(0)} = \\exp(-x/\\lambda)\n$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate this ratio using the provided numerical parameters.

Effect on Resting Potential ($V_{\\text{rest}}$)**\n\nThe resting membrane potential is the steady-state voltage where the net ionic current across the membrane is zero. According to the problem, HCN channels are active at the control resting potential of approximately $-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The total current is the sum of the HCN current ($I_{\\text{HCN}}$) and the currents through other channels, which we can collectively term the leak current ($I_{\\text{leak}}$).\n\nAt rest, the net current $I_{\\text{net}} = 0$:\n$$I_{\\text{net}} = I_{\\text{leak}} + I_{\\text{HCN}} = 0$$\nUsing Ohm's law for ionic currents, $I_i = g_i (V_m - E_i)$, where $g_i$ is the conductance and $E_i$ is the reversal potential for ion species $i$:\n$$g_{\\text{leak}}(V_{\\text{rest}} - E_{\\text{leak}}) + g_{\\text{HCN}}(V_{\\text{rest}} - E_{\\text{HCN}}) = 0$$\nSolving for $V_{\\text{rest}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{rest}} = \\frac{g_{\\text{leak}}E_{\\text{leak}} + g_{\\text{HCN}}E_{\\text{HCN}}}{g_{\\text{leak}} + g_{\\text{HCN}}}$$\nThis shows that $V_{\\text{rest}}$ is a weighted average of the reversal potentials, with conductances as the weights.\n\nWe are given:\n- Control $V_{\\text{rest}} \\approx -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n- HCN reversal potential $E_{\\text{HCN}} \\approx -35\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n\nSince the control $V_{\\text{rest}}$ ($-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) is hyperpolarized relative to $E_{\\text{HCN}}$ ($-35\\,\\mathrm{mV}$), the driving force $(V_{\\text{rest}} - E_{\\text{HCN}})$ is negative. This results in a persistent inward current ($I_{\\text{HCN}}  0$) flowing through the HCN channels at rest. This inward, depolarizing current is what pulls the resting potential up to $-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ from the more negative leak reversal potential, $E_{\\text{leak}}$.\n\nWhen the HCN channel blocker is applied, its conductance $g_{\\text{HCN}}$ becomes zero. The equation for the new resting potential, $V'_{\\text{rest}}$, simplifies to:\n$$V'_{\\text{rest}} = \\frac{g_{\\text{leak}}E_{\\text{leak}}}{g_{\\text{leak}}} = E_{\\text{leak}}$$\nSince the depolarizing influence of $I_{\\text{HCN}}$ has been removed, the membrane potential will settle at the reversal potential of the remaining leak currents, which must be more negative than $-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Therefore, the resting potential **hyperpolarizes**.\n\n**2. Effect on Input Resistance ($R_{\\text{in}}$)**\n\nInput resistance ($R_{\\text{in}}$) is a measure of the neuron's response to an injected current and is inversely related to the total membrane conductance ($G_{\\text{total}}$) at a given voltage.\n$$R_{\\text{in}} = \\frac{1}{G_{\\text{total}}}$$\nThe total conductance is the sum of all individual conductances:\n$$G_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_i g_i = g_{\\text{leak}} + g_{\\text{HCN}}$$\nIn the control condition, HCN channels are active at rest, so $g_{\\text{HCN}} > 0$. When the blocker is applied, $g_{\\text{HCN}}$ is eliminated. The new total conductance, $G'_{\\text{total}}$, is:\n$$G'_{\\text{total}} = g_{\\text{leak}}$$\nSince $g_{\\text{HCN}} > 0$, it is clear that $G'_{\\text{total}}  G_{\\text{total}}$. As the total conductance decreases, its reciprocal, the input resistance, must increase. Therefore, the input resistance **increases**.\n\n**3. Effect on bAP Peak Amplitude**\n\nThe peak amplitude of a bAP is determined by the balance between the powerful regenerative inward current from voltage-gated sodium channels ($I_{\\text{Na}}$) and the opposing outward currents. According to the problem, on the fast timescale of an action potential, the HCN conductance can be considered approximately steady.\n\nDuring the upstroke and peak of the action potential, the membrane potential becomes highly positive (e.g., $+20\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to $+40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$). At these potentials, the driving force for the HCN current, $(V_{\\text{peak}} - E_{\\text{HCN}})$, is large and positive (e.g., $(+30\\,\\mathrm{mV}) - (-35\\,\\mathrm{mV}) = +65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$). This creates a significant outward (repolarizing) current, $I_{\\text{HCN}} = g_{\\text{HCN}}(V_{\\text{peak}} - E_{\\text{HCN}}) > 0$. This steady outward current acts as a shunt, opposing the depolarization caused by $I_{\\text{Na}}$ and thus limiting the peak amplitude of the bAP.\n\nWhen $g_{\\text{HCN}}$ is blocked, this shunting outward current is removed. The absence of this opposing current allows the inward sodium current to depolarize the membrane to a higher potential before being counteracted by the activation of voltage-gated potassium channels.\n\nFurthermore, from the analysis of input resistance, we know that blocking $g_{\\text{HCN}}$ increases the membrane resistance ($r_m$, a component of $R_{\\text{in}}$). According to passive cable theory, the length constant $\\lambda = \\sqrt{r_m / r_a}$ (where $r_a$ is axial resistance) increases. A larger length constant means the bAP will attenuate less as it propagates from the soma into the dendrite. Both the removal of the shunt and the improved passive propagation contribute to a larger bAP amplitude at the distal site. Therefore, the bAP peak amplitude **increases**.\n\n**4. Effect on bAP Peak-Time Delay**\n\nThe propagation speed of a voltage signal along a dendritic cable depends on its passive electrical properties, primarily the membrane time constant, $\\tau_m$. The time constant is defined as:\n$$\\tau_m = R_m C_m$$\nwhere $R_m$ is the specific membrane resistance (in units of $\\Omega \\cdot \\text{cm}^2$) and $C_m$ is the specific membrane capacitance (in units of $\\text{F} / \\text{cm}^2$). $R_m$ is the inverse of the specific membrane conductance, $G_m$. As established in the analysis of input resistance, blocking $g_{\\text{HCN}}$ increases the total input resistance, which implies an increase in the membrane resistance $R_m$. Assuming $C_m$ is constant (as it is a property of the lipid bilayer itself), an increase in $R_m$ directly leads to an increase in the membrane time constant $\\tau_m$.\n\nA larger time constant means that each segment of the dendritic membrane takes longer to charge up to the threshold for AP propagation. This slows down the regenerative propagation of the action potential along the dendrite. Consequently, the time it takes for the action potential peak to travel from the soma to the recording site at $200\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ will be longer. Therefore, the bAP peak-time delay **increases**.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:**\n- Resting Potential: **Hyperpolarizes**\n- Input Resistance: **Increases**\n- bAP Peak Amplitude: **Increases**\n- bAP Peak-Time Delay: **Increases**\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **A.
