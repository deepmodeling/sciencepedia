While the specific capacitance $C_m$ is provided, it is irrelevant for a direct current (DC) steady-state analysis, as capacitive current $I_C = C_m \\frac{dV}{dt}$ is zero when the voltage is constant. The instruction to approximate the semi-infinite cable with an infinite cable solution is a minor ambiguity, but it provides a clear directive for simplification, which we will follow. We proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nFirst, we define the resistance per unit length for the cylindrical cable. The membrane resistance per unit length, $r_m$, is the specific membrane resistance $R_m$ divided by the circumference of the cylinder, $2\\pi a$.\n$$r_m = \\frac{R_m}{2\\pi a}$$\nThe units are $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}$.

The cable equation simplifies to an ordinary differential equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{r_i}\\frac{d^2 V}{d x^2} = \\frac{V}{r_m}$$\nThis can be rearranged into the standard form:\n$$\\frac{r_m}{r_i} \\frac{d^2 V}{d x^2} = V$$\nBy definition, the space constant $\\lambda$ is the parameter that satisfies the equation $\\lambda^2 \\frac{d^2 V}{d x^2} = V$.

The input is at a distance $x$ from the soma (at position $0$). The attenuation factor $A$ is the ratio $V(0)/V(x)$. The problem states to use the steady-state solution for an infinite cable to approximate the behavior. In an infinite cable, the voltage decays exponentially from the source in both directions.
