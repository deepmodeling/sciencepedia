A synaptic “failure” is operationally defined as an evoked postsynaptic response in which zero vesicles are released. Assume that release events at different sites are independent and that multivesicular release is allowed. Before LTP, the release probability is $p_{0} = 0.1$; after LTP, it is $p_{1} = 0.25$.

Therefore, the problem is valid and we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe release of a vesicle at a single site is a stochastic event that can be modeled as a Bernoulli trial. For a given action potential, a site can either release a vesicle with probability $p$ or fail to release a vesicle with probability $1-p$.\n\nA synaptic failure for the entire bouton is defined as the event where none of the $n$ sites release a vesicle.

Consider a synapse that obeys the quantal hypothesis with $n$ independent release sites, each releasing at most one vesicle per action potential, with probability $p$, and each vesicle producing a quantal postsynaptic response of size $q$. Assume the postsynaptic quantal size $q$ and receptor properties are unchanged by the manipulations below, and that detection noise is negligible.\n\nAn intervention produces LTP that doubles the mean excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude. Two nonexclusive mechanistic hypotheses are considered: doubling arises either from an increase in $n$ at fixed $p$ (RRP expansion) or from an increase in $p$ at fixed $n$ (release-probability upregulation).

It is scientifically grounded in the canonical quantal model of synaptic transmission, is well-posed, and uses precise, objective language. The setup is internally consistent and allows for a unique solution to be derived from first principles.\n\nWe begin by formally defining the quantal model and the observables in question. The release of neurotransmitter vesicles is described by a binomial process, where $n$ is the number of independent release sites (the readily releasable pool, RRP) and $p$ is the probability of release from any given site in response to an action potential. The postsynaptic response to a single vesicle is the quantal size, $q$. The total postsynaptic current, $I$, is the number of released vesicles, $k$, multiplied by $q$. The number of released vesicles $k$ follows a binomial distribution, $k \\sim B(n, p)$.\n\nThe mean ($\\mu$) and variance ($\\sigma^2$) of the postsynaptic current are given by:\n$$ \\mu = E[k \\cdot q] = q \\cdot E[k] = n p q $$\n$$ \\sigma^2 = \\text{Var}[k \\cdot q] = q^2 \\cdot \\text{Var}[k] = n p (1-p) q^2 $$\n\nFrom these, we derive the expressions for the key observables:\n\n1.  **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**: The ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.\n    $$ CV = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu} = \\frac{\\sqrt{n p (1-p) q^2}}{n p q} = \\frac{\\sqrt{n p (1-p)}}{n p} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-p}{np}} $$\n\n2.  **Failure Rate ($P_0$)**: The probability of releasing zero vesicles ($k=0$).\n    $$ P_0 = P(k=0) = \\binom{n}{0} p^0 (1-p)^{n-0} = (1-p)^n $$\n\n3.  **Paired-Pulse Ratio (PPR)**: The ratio of the mean response to a second stimulus ($E_2$) to the mean response to a first stimulus ($E_1$), delivered in close succession. A simple but effective model for short-term depression assumes that the primary cause is the depletion of the RRP. The mean response to the first pulse is $E_1 = npq$. The number of vesicles remaining for the second pulse is $n - E[k_1] = n - np = n(1-p)$. Assuming the release probability $p$ is the same for the second pulse, the mean response is $E_2 = n(1-p)pq$. Thus, the PPR is:\n    $$ PPR = \\frac{E_2}{E_1} = \\frac{n(1-p)pq}{npq} = 1-p $$\n    This model shows that PPR is inversely related to the initial release probability $p$.\n\nThe problem states that an intervention produces Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) that doubles the mean excitatory postsynaptic current. Let the initial state be $(n_1, p_1)$ with mean $\\mu_1 = n_1 p_1 q$, and the potentiated state be $(n_2, p_2)$ with mean $\\mu_2 = n_2 p_2 q$. We are given $\\mu_2 = 2\\mu_1$.\n\nWe now analyze the two proposed, non-exclusive mechanisms for this doubling of the mean.\n\n**Hypothesis 1: RRP Expansion**\nThe increase in mean is solely due to an increase in $n$, with $p$ held constant.\n$p_2 = p_1$. The condition $\\mu_2 = 2\\mu_1$ implies $n_2 p_2 q = 2 n_1 p_1 q$, which simplifies to $n_2 = 2n_1$. The transformation is $(n_1, p_1) \\rightarrow (2n_1, p_1)$.\n\nLet us evaluate the consequences:\n-   **CV**:\n    $CV_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-p_1}{2n_1 p_1}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{1-p_1}{n_1 p_1}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} CV_1$.\n    The CV decreases by a factor of $1/\\sqrt{2}$, which is proportional to $n^{-1/2}$.\n-   **Failure Rate**:\n    $P_{0,2} = (1-p_1)^{2n_1} = ((1-p_1)^{n_1})^2 = (P_{0,1})^2$. Since $P_{0,1}  1$, the failure rate decreases.\n-   **PPR**:\n    $PPR_2 = 1 - p_1 = PPR_1$. The PPR remains unchanged, as it depends only on $p$ in this model.\n\n**Hypothesis 2: Release Probability Upregulation**\nThe increase in mean is solely due to an increase in $p$, with $n$ held constant.\n$n_2 = n_1$. The condition $\\mu_2 = 2\\mu_1$ implies $n_2 p_2 q = 2 n_1 p_1 q$, which simplifies to $p_2 = 2p_1$. This is valid only if $p_1  0.5$. The transformation is $(n_1, p_1) \\rightarrow (n_1, 2p_1)$.\n\nLet us evaluate the consequences:\n-   **CV**:\n    $CV_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-2p_1}{n_1 (2p_1)}}$.\n    The ratio $CV_2/CV_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-2p_1}{2p_1} \\frac{p_1}{1-p_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-2p_1}{2(1-p_1)}}$. Since $1-2p_1  2(1-p_1)$ for any valid $p_1  0$, the ratio is less than $1$. The CV decreases.\n-   **Failure Rate**:\n    $P_{0,2} = (1-2p_1)^{n_1}$. Since $1-2p_1  1-p_1$, it follows that $P_{0,2}  P_{0,1}$. The failure rate decreases.\n-   **PPR**:\n    $PPR_2 = 1 - 2p_1$. Since $p_1  0$, $PPR_2  1-p_1 = PPR_1$. The PPR decreases, indicating stronger paired-pulse depression.\n\nNow we analyze the proposed diagnostic tools.\n\n1.  **Multiple-Probability Fluctuation Analysis (MPFA)**: This technique relates variance to the mean as release probability is varied (e.g., by changing extracellular calcium). The governing equation is a parabola:\n    $$ \\sigma^2 = q\\mu - \\frac{1}{n}\\mu^2 $$\n    The curvature of this parabola is given by the coefficient of the $\\mu^2$ term, which is $-1/n$.\n    -   Under Hypothesis 1 ($n \\to 2n$), the magnitude of the curvature, $1/n$, decreases by a factor of $2$. The parabola becomes flatter.\n    -   Under Hypothesis 2 ($n$ constant), the curvature remains unchanged.\n\n2.  **Cumulative EPSC Back-Extrapolation**: This method estimates the size of the RRP by measuring the total charge transferred during a high-frequency stimulus train that depletes the RRP. The y-intercept of the cumulative current plot, extrapolated from the linear phase of depletion, is proportional to the total charge in the RRP, which is $n \\cdot q$.\n    -   Under Hypothesis 1 ($n \\to 2n$), the intercept will double, indicating a larger RRP.\n    -   Under Hypothesis 2 ($n$ constant), the intercept will remain unchanged.\n\n3.  **MK-801 Block Kinetics**: MK-801 is a use-dependent, irreversible open-channel blocker of NMDARs. The rate of block of the NMDAR-mediated current during repetitive stimulation is proportional to the probability of channel opening, which is in turn proportional to the presynaptic release probability, $p$.\n    -   Under Hypothesis 1 ($p$ constant), the rate of block is unchanged.\n    -   Under Hypothesis 2 ($p \\to 2p$), the rate of block accelerates.\n\nSummary of Predictions:\n| Observable/Diagnostic          | Hypothesis 1: $n \\to 2n$, $p$ constant | Hypothesis 2: $n$ constant, $p \\to 2p$ |\n| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| **CV**                         | Decreases ($\\propto n^{-1/2}$)         | Decreases                              |\n| **Failure Rate, $P_0$**        | Decreases                              | Decreases                              |\n| **PPR**                        | Unchanged                              | Decreases (more depression)            |\n| **MPFA Curvature**             | Decreases (flatter parabola)           | Unchanged                              |\n| **Cumulative EPSC Intercept**  | Increases                              | Unchanged                              |\n| **MK-801 Block Rate**          | Unchanged                              | Accelerates                            |\n\nNow we evaluate the provided options.\n\n**A.**\n-   **If mean doubles by increasing $n$**: States CV decreases $\\propto n^{-1/2}$, failure rate decreases, PPR is unchanged.

In quantal analysis, postsynaptic nonlinearities like receptor saturation and desensitization can produce changes in measured parameters that mimic a true presynaptic modification. This advanced problem delves into these critical confounds, tasking you with both explaining how they can mislead analysis and designing decisive control experiments to disambiguate the true locus of plasticity [@problem_id:2740125].", "problem": "A synapse expresses Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) after a high-frequency induction protocol. You voltage-clamp a postsynaptic pyramidal neuron and isolate alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). Before induction, the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) at an interpulse interval of $50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ is $1.8$, the coefficient of variation (CV) of EPSC amplitudes is $0.5$, and the failure rate is $0.35$. After induction, the mean EPSC amplitude increases by $50\\%$, PPR decreases to $1.2$, CV decreases by approximately $30\\%$, and the failure rate decreases to $0.10$. Under the standard quantal model, the mean response is determined by the number of functional release sites $N$, release probability $p$, and quantal size $q$.\n\nHowever, two postsynaptic nonlinearities can confound presynaptic diagnostics: receptor saturation and desensitization. Consider the following biophysically motivated assumptions and definitions as a starting base:\n\n- Under linear postsynaptic transduction, the post-synaptic current from $n$ released quanta is proportional to $n q$ and the binomial model for release gives a mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$ that depend on $N$, $p$, and $q$.\n- In the presence of receptor saturation, the postsynaptic current for a given cleft glutamate concentration $[G]$ is a concave, saturating function $\\phi([G])$ (for example, $\\phi([G]) = \\frac{[G]}{K + [G]}$ for some effective dissociation constant $K$), so that the total current from $n$ near-synchronous vesicles is approximately proportional to $q \\,\\phi(n \\,[G]_1)$, where $[G]_1$ is the cleft glutamate peak from a single vesicle.\n- In the presence of fast desensitization, a fraction $\\alpha$ with $0  \\alpha  1$ of receptors enter a non-conducting state after the first pulse and are unavailable for the second pulse at an interpulse interval of $50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, effectively scaling the second response by a factor $(1-\\alpha)$ independent of presynaptic release probability over that short interval.\n\nTask: Using only these base assumptions and definitions, reason from first principles to answer the following. First, derive qualitatively and, where possible, quantitatively how a concave, saturating postsynaptic input–output relationship $\\phi$ and fast desensitization bias three commonly used presynaptic diagnostics—PPR, CV, and failure rate—after LTP. In particular, explain why (i) PPR can decrease even if presynaptic release probability $p$ does not change, (ii) CV can decrease when the mean increases even without a presynaptic change in $p$, and (iii) failure rate can artifactually decrease if near-threshold events are compressed by saturation. Second, propose a single decisive control experiment that would disambiguate a true presynaptic change in $p$ from postsynaptic receptor saturation/desensitization, and predict the qualitatively expected outcome of this control in the two cases.\n\nChoose the option that best captures a correct derivation and an appropriate, decisive control with correct predictions.\n\nA. Because receptor saturation makes the postsynaptic current a concave function of total glutamate, mapping binomial release through $\\phi$ reduces relative variance by Jensen’s inequality and compresses large responses, so $\\mathrm{CV}$ decreases as the mean increases even if $p$ is unchanged, and near-threshold successes are boosted above detection, decreasing apparent failures. Desensitization multiplies the second pulse by $(1-\\alpha)$, so PPR decreases without any presynaptic change. A decisive control is to relieve saturation and desensitization selectively: apply a low-affinity competitive AMPA receptor antagonist such as $\\gamma$-D-glutamylglycine ($\\gamma$-DGG) to lower effective affinity (linearizing $\\phi$ over the physiological range) and apply cyclothiazide to block AMPA receptor desensitization. Prediction: if LTP is presynaptic (increased $p$), the fractional increase in mean and the PPR decrease persist in $\\gamma$-DGG and are unaffected by cyclothiazide; if the apparent presynaptic signature is due to saturation/desensitization, the mean rescales more linearly (larger fractional increase in $\\gamma$-DGG) and the PPR decrease is abolished by cyclothiazide. As an orthogonal control specific to release probability, the rate of N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor open-channel blocker dizocilpine maleate (MK-801) use-dependent block should accelerate only if $p$ truly increases and should be insensitive to postsynaptic saturation.\n\nB. Receptor saturation makes the postsynaptic response a convex function of glutamate, which increases $\\mathrm{CV}$ when the mean increases, and desensitization increases the second response due to recovery during the interpulse interval, so PPR increases. A decisive control is to block NMDA receptors with D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV): if the changes persist in APV, they are postsynaptic; if they disappear, they are presynaptic.\n\nC. Desensitization of AMPA receptors does not affect paired-pulse measurements at $50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ because recovery is complete by that time, so any PPR decrease implies presynaptic changes in $p$. A decisive control is to increase temperature from $22^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ to $37^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$; if the effects vanish, they were postsynaptic; if they remain, they were presynaptic.\n\nD. Saturation alters the quantal size $q$ but leaves the variance-to-mean ratio unchanged, so $\\mathrm{CV}$ is unaffected by saturation. A decisive control is to pharmacologically block gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA_A) receptors with bicuculline to unmask excitation; if PPR decreases further, the plasticity is presynaptic; if PPR increases, it is postsynaptic.", "solution": "The problem statement is a valid, well-posed, and scientifically grounded inquiry into the mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP) expression at a central synapse. It addresses a classical ambiguity in cellular neuroscience: distinguishing presynaptic changes (e.g., in release probability, $p$) from postsynaptic changes (e.g., in quantal size, $q$) when postsynaptic nonlinearities can confound the interpretation of standard quantal analysis parameters. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe task is twofold: first, to derive how postsynaptic receptor saturation and desensitization can create the illusion of presynaptic plasticity, and second, to propose a decisive experiment to resolve this ambiguity.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Confounding Effects**\n\nWe are given that after LTP induction, the mean excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitude increases by $50\\%$, the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) decreases from $1.8$ to $1.2$, the coefficient of variation (CV) decreases by $\\approx 30\\%$, and the failure rate decreases from $0.35$ to $0.10$. These are all hallmarks of an increase in presynaptic release probability, $p$. The task is to explain how these observations could arise even if $p$ is unchanged and the potentiation is purely postsynaptic (i.e., an increase in the quantal size, $q$).\n\nLet us assume a purely postsynaptic LTP, where $q$ increases. The number of release sites $N$ and the release probability $p$ are constant.\n\n**(i) Paired-Pulse Ratio (PPR) Decrease**\n\nPPR is defined as the ratio of the mean amplitude of the second of two closely timed EPSCs to the first: $PPR = \\mu_{2} / \\mu_{1}$. The initial $PPR = 1.8$ indicates paired-pulse facilitation, a presynaptic phenomenon where the release probability for the second pulse is higher than for the first.\n\n*   **Effect of Desensitization:** The problem states that a fraction $\\alpha$ of AMPA receptors enter a non-conducting desensitized state after the first pulse and are unavailable for the second pulse at a $50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ interval. This directly scales the response to the second stimulus. If the response to the first pulse is $\\mu_{1}$ and the (facilitated) response to the second pulse without desensitization would be $\\mu_{2,raw}$, then the measured second response is $\\mu_{2,measured} = (1-\\alpha) \\mu_{2,raw}$. The PPR becomes $PPR_{measured} = \\frac{(1-\\alpha) \\mu_{2,raw}}{\\mu_{1}} = (1-\\alpha) PPR_{raw}$.\n    If LTP induction causes or enhances desensitization (i.e., $\\alpha$ increases or becomes significant), the measured PPR will decrease. For instance, if the underlying presynaptic facilitation ratio is unchanged at $1.8$, a decrease in measured PPR to $1.2$ could be explained by a desensitization factor $\\alpha$ such that $1.2 = (1-\\alpha) \\times 1.8$, which yields $1-\\alpha = 1.2/1.8 = 2/3$, or $\\alpha \\approx 0.33$. This is a biophysically plausible value. Thus, desensitization can cause PPR to decrease without any change in presynaptic function.\n\n*   **Effect of Saturation:** Saturation is described by a concave input-output function, $\\phi$. Let the amount of glutamate released by the first and second pulses be $G_1$ and $G_2$. Due to presynaptic facilitation, $G_2  G_1$. The measured currents are $I_1 \\propto \\phi(G_1)$ and $I_2 \\propto \\phi(G_2)$. Because $\\phi$ is concave, it compresses larger inputs more than smaller inputs. Therefore, the ratio $\\phi(G_2) / \\phi(G_1)$ will be smaller than the ratio $G_2 / G_1$. After a postsynaptic LTP (increase in $q$), the effective glutamate concentration sensed by receptors (or the number of receptors activated) is pushed further into the saturating regime of the function $\\phi$. This will further compress the larger second response relative to the first, causing the measured PPR to decrease.\n\n**(ii) Coefficient of Variation (CV) Decrease**\n\nThe CV is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the EPSC amplitude distribution: $CV = \\sigma / \\mu$. In a simple linear binomial model where current is directly proportional to the number of released quanta $n$, we have $\\mu = Npq$ and variance $\\sigma^2 = Np(1-p)q^2$. The squared CV is $CV^2 = \\sigma^2 / \\mu^2 = \\frac{Np(1-p)q^2}{(Npq)^2} = \\frac{1-p}{Np}$. In this linear case, changing only the quantal size $q$ leaves the CV unchanged, as $q$ cancels out.\n\n*   **Effect of Saturation:** With saturation, the postsynaptic current $I$ is a concave function of the number of released quanta $n$, i.e., $I(n) = \\phi(n \\cdot q_{eff})$, where $q_{eff}$ represents the glutamate packet from one vesicle. A concave function compresses the range of the output distribution. For a given distribution of $n$ (determined by $N$ and $p$), the distribution of $I(n)$ will have a smaller variance *relative to its mean* than the distribution of $n$ itself. When a postsynaptic LTP increases the quantal size $q$, the input to the function $\\phi$ is effectively scaled up. This pushes the responses into a flatter, more saturated part of the curve. In this region, the output variance $\\sigma_I^2$ grows more slowly than the output mean $\\mu_I$. Consequently, the ratio $CV = \\sigma_I / \\mu_I$ decreases. This explains how CV can decrease following an increase in mean response, even if $p$ has not changed. The reference to Jensen's inequality ($E[\\phi(X)] \\le \\phi(E[X])$ for a concave function $\\phi$) is conceptually related, as it captures the nature of concave transformations, but the core argument rests on the reduction of relative variance.\n\n**(iii) Failure Rate Decrease**\n\nThe failure rate is the fraction of trials with no detectable response. True presynaptic failures occur when zero quanta are released, with probability $(1-p)^N$.\n\n*   **Effect of Increased Quantal Size:** An \"apparent\" or \"artifactual\" decrease in failure rate can occur if some successes are misclassified as failures. This happens when the response to a single quantum ($n=1$) is very small and falls within the noise of the recording, making it indistinguishable from a true failure ($n=0$). A purely postsynaptic LTP increases the quantal size $q$. This boosts the amplitude of all successful responses, including the smallest ones corresponding to $n=1$. If the new, larger single-quantal events are now reliably above the detection threshold, they will be correctly counted as successes. This reclassification of events from \"failure\" to \"success\" reduces the measured failure rate, even if the true presynaptic failure probability $(1-p)^N$ has not changed. Saturation does not cause this effect; rather, it is the increase in $q$ itself that is responsible.\n\n**Part 2: Decisive Control Experiment**\n\nTo disambiguate a true presynaptic change in $p$ from the postsynaptic artifacts described above, a control experiment must either (1) eliminate the artifacts or (2) provide an independent measure of $p$.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Eliminate Postsynaptic Nonlinearities.**\n    *   **To counter saturation:** Apply a low-affinity competitive AMPA receptor antagonist, such as $\\gamma$-D-glutamylglycine ($\\gamma$-DGG). By competing with glutamate, this drug reduces the effective affinity of the receptor, requiring more glutamate for the same response. This linearizes the dose-response curve in the physiological range of glutamate concentrations.\n    *   **To counter desensitization:** Apply a drug that blocks AMPA receptor desensitization, such as cyclothiazide (CTZ).\n\n    **Predictions:**\n    *   **Case 1 (True presynaptic LTP, i.e., increased $p$):** In the presence of these drugs, the changes due to LTP should persist because the underlying presynaptic mechanism is unaffected. PPR should still decrease after LTP induction (as it reflects a change in release probability), and CV should also decrease (as it depends on $p$).\n    *   **Case 2 (Postsynaptic LTP with artifacts):** In the presence of these drugs, the artifacts should be removed. Blocking desensitization with CTZ should abolish the artificial decrease in PPR. Linearizing the response with $\\gamma$-DGG should prevent the artificial decrease in CV. Thus, after LTP induction in the presence of these drugs, the mean EPSC would still increase (due to increased $q$), but PPR and CV would remain largely unchanged, revealing the purely postsynaptic nature of the plasticity.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Independent Measure of Release Probability.**\n    *   **Method:** Use-dependent block of NMDA receptors by a non-competitive, open-channel blocker like dizocilpine maleate (MK-801). The rate of block during low-frequency stimulation is proportional to the probability of channel opening per stimulus, which is in turn dependent on the probability of presynaptic glutamate release, $p$. This measurement is insensitive to postsynaptic AMPA receptor properties like saturation or desensitization.\n    *   **Predictions:**\n        *   **Case 1 (True presynaptic LTP, i.e., increased $p$):** The rate of MK-801 block will be faster after LTP induction, because glutamate is released more often, leading to more frequent opening of NMDA receptor channels.\n        *   **Case 2 (Postsynaptic LTP, i.e., constant $p$):** The rate of MK-801 block will be unchanged after LTP induction, because the probability of glutamate release has not changed.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Because receptor saturation makes the postsynaptic current a concave function of total glutamate, mapping binomial release through $\\phi$ reduces relative variance by Jensen’s inequality and compresses large responses, so $\\mathrm{CV}$ decreases as the mean increases even if $p$ is unchanged, and near-threshold successes are boosted above detection, decreasing apparent failures. Desensitization multiplies the second pulse by $(1-\\alpha)$, so PPR decreases without any presynaptic change. A decisive control is to relieve saturation and desensitization selectively: apply a low-affinity competitive AMPA receptor antagonist such as $\\gamma$-D-glutamylglycine ($\\gamma$-DGG) to lower effective affinity (linearizing $\\phi$ over the physiological range) and apply cyclothiazide to block AMPA receptor desensitization. Prediction: if LTP is presynaptic (increased $p$), the fractional increase in mean and the PPR decrease persist in $\\gamma$-DGG and are unaffected by cyclothiazide; if the apparent presynaptic signature is due to saturation/desensitization, the mean rescales more linearly (larger fractional increase in $\\gamma$-DGG) and the PPR decrease is abolished by cyclothiazide. As an orthogonal control specific to release probability, the rate of N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor open-channel blocker dizocilpine maleate (MK-801) use-dependent block should accelerate only if $p$ truly increases and should be insensitive to postsynaptic saturation.**\n    This option is entirely correct. It provides a correct and complete explanation for all three confounding effects. It proposes two different, standard, and decisive experimental controls ($\\gamma$-DGG/CTZ and MK-801) and correctly predicts the outcomes for both presynaptic and postsynaptic expression loci. The reasoning is sound and aligns perfectly with the principles derived above. **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. Receptor saturation makes the postsynaptic response a convex function of glutamate, which increases $\\mathrm{CV}$ when the mean increases, and desensitization increases the second response due to recovery during the interpulse interval, so PPR increases. A decisive control is to block NMDA receptors with D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV): if the changes persist in APV, they are postsynaptic; if they disappear, they are presynaptic.**\n    This option is incorrect. Saturation implies a concave, not convex, function. Desensitization decreases, not increases, the second response. The proposed control with APV is irrelevant for studying the expression of AMPA-mediated currents. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. Desensitization of AMPA receptors does not affect paired-pulse measurements at $50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ because recovery is complete by that time, so any PPR decrease implies presynaptic changes in $p$. A decisive control is to increase temperature from $22^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ to $37^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$; if the effects vanish, they were postsynaptic; if they remain, they were presynaptic.**\n    This option is incorrect. Recovery from desensitization is typically not complete at $50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, so it does affect PPR. The proposed control of changing temperature is non-specific and would affect nearly all parameters of synaptic transmission, making it impossible to draw a clear conclusion. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. Saturation alters the quantal size $q$ but leaves the variance-to-mean ratio unchanged, so $\\mathrm{CV}$ is unaffected by saturation. A decisive control is to pharmacologically block gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA_A) receptors with bicuculline to unmask excitation; if PPR decreases further, the plasticity is presynaptic; if PPR increases, it is postsynaptic.**\n    This option is incorrect. The premise that saturation leaves CV unaffected is fundamentally wrong; the effect on CV is a key consequence of saturation. The proposed control with bicuculline is irrelevant, as the problem specifies that AMPA EPSCs are already isolated. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option A is the only one that presents a correct derivation and a valid, decisive experimental design.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2740125"}]}
