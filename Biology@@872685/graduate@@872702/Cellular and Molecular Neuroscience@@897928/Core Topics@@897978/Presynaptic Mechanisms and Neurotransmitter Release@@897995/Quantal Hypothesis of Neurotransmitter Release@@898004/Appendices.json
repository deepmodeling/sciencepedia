At its core is the idea that the total postsynaptic response is the sum of discrete, 'quantal' events, each corresponding to the contents of one synaptic vesicle. This first practice provides a direct application of this principle, demonstrating how to calculate the quantal content—the number of vesicles released—by relating the amplitude of the full synaptic potential to that of a single miniature potential [@problem_id:2336131].", "problem": "In a neurophysiology experiment studying a specific synapse in the central nervous system, a researcher is investigating the quantal nature of neurotransmitter release. The quantal hypothesis posits that neurotransmitters are released in discrete packets, or quanta, with each quantum corresponding to the contents of a single synaptic vesicle. The postsynaptic electrical response to a single quantum is called a miniature Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (mEPSP).\n\nBy recording from the postsynaptic neuron in the absence of presynaptic stimulation, the researcher measures the average amplitude of spontaneously occurring mEPSPs to be $0.5$ mV. When the presynaptic neuron is electrically stimulated, it fires an action potential, causing the synchronous release of multiple vesicles. This results in a larger, compound Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP), which is measured to have an amplitude of $4.0$ mV.\n\nAssuming a simple linear summation of mEPSPs, calculate the quantal content for this stimulus-evoked EPSP. The quantal content is defined as the number of individual vesicles that were released to generate the full EPSP.", "solution": "The quantal hypothesis models an evoked EPSP as the sum of identical quantal events (mEPSPs). Under the assumption of linear summation, the evoked EPSP amplitude equals the product of the quantal content and the mean quantal amplitude. Denote the mean mEPSP amplitude as $a_{q}$ and the evoked EPSP amplitude as $A$. The quantal content $m$ is defined by the relation:\n$$\nA = m\\,a_{q}.\n$$\nSolving for $m$ gives:\n$$\nm = \\frac{A}{a_{q}}.\n$$\nSubstituting the measured values $A = 4.0\\ \\text{mV}$ and $a_{q} = 0.5\\ \\text{mV}$ yields:\n$$\nm = \\frac{4.0\\ \\text{mV}}{0.5\\ \\text{mV}} = 8,\n$$\nwhere the millivolt units cancel, leaving a dimensionless count of quanta.

This practice moves beyond simple averages to explore the coefficient of variation (CV), a powerful statistical tool.

According to the quantal hypothesis of neurotransmitter release, each of $N$ anatomically defined release sites can release at most one vesicle per trial, independently, with identical release probability $p$. On each trial, the number of released vesicles $k$ is therefore modeled as a binomial random variable with parameters $N$ and $p$. The postsynaptic response amplitude $A$ on a trial is assumed to be proportional to the number of released vesicles, with a quantal size $q$ that is constant across trials, so that $A = q\\,k$.
