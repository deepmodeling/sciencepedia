The use of pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins (pHluorins) to measure synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis is a standard technique in cellular neuroscience. The provided $pH$ values for the synaptic vesicle lumen and the extracellular space, as well as the $pK_a$ for a common pHluorin variant, are experimentally realistic. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear definition of the quantity to be calculated. The underlying chemical principles (Henderson-Hasselbalch equation) are correctly invoked. The problem is objective, complete, and contains no contradictions or scientifically invalid assumptions.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe fluorescence reporter is a monoprotic acid, which we denote as $HA$. It exists in equilibrium with its deprotonated (conjugate base) form, $A^-$, according to the reaction:\n$$\nHA \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + A^-\n$$\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation describes the relationship between $pH$, $pK_a$, and the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base:\n$$\npH = pK_a + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that fluorescence, $F$, is proportional to the fraction of deprotonated reporter molecules. Let us define this fraction, $\\alpha$, as:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{[A^-]}{[HA] + [A^-]}\n$$\nThus, $F = k \\cdot \\alpha$ for some proportionality constant $k$. To derive the dependence of fluorescence on $pH$ and $pK_a$, we must express $\\alpha$ as a function of these variables. From the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, we can write the ratio of the concentrations as:\n$$\n\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} = 10^{(pH - pK_a)}\n$$\nNow, we can rewrite the expression for $\\alpha$ by dividing the numerator and denominator by $[HA]$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}}{1 + \\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the ratio gives the dependence of $\\alpha$ (and thus fluorescence) on $pH$ and $pK_a$:\n$$\n\\alpha(pH) = \\frac{10^{(pH - pK_a)}}{1 + 10^{(pH - pK_a)}}\n$$\nThis can be written in the equivalent and often more convenient sigmoidal form:\n$$\n\\alpha(pH) = \\frac{1}{10^{(pK_a - pH)} + 1}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation of the proportional dependence of fluorescence on $pH$ and $pK_a$.

All terms are clearly defined.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be derived from first principles as stated.\n\nDerivation of the solution proceeds in three stages.\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of synaptic vesicles, $N_{SV}$, retrieved during the recovery period. The problem states that the total capacitance decrease, $\\Delta C$, is the result of additive contributions from individual vesicles, each with capacitance $C_{SV}$. This is an explicit assumption of additivity.\n$$\n\\Delta C = N_{SV} \\cdot C_{SV}\n$$\nSolving for the number of vesicles, $N_{SV}$:\n$$\nN_{SV} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{C_{SV}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nN_{SV} = \\frac{2.5\\,\\mathrm{fF}}{0.05\\,\\mathrm{fF}} = 50\n$$\nThus, $50$ vesicles are retrieved from the plasma membrane.\n\nSecond, we determine the observed vesicle retrieval rate, which we denote as $\\nu_{obs}$. This rate is defined as the total number of vesicles retrieved, $N_{SV}$, divided by the time interval, $T$, over which the retrieval occurs. This calculation assumes a constant average rate over the interval.\n$$\n\\nu_{obs} = \\frac{N_{SV}}{T}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated value for $N_{SV}$ and the given value for $T$:\n$$\n\\nu_{obs} = \\frac{50}{5\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}\n$$\nThe observed rate of vesicle retrieval is $10$ vesicles per second.\n\nThird, we determine the canonical rate for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, $\\nu_{CME}$. The problem states that the maximal rate is the inverse of the cycle time, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{CME}}$, for a single endocytic site (a clathrin-coated pit).\n$$\n\\nu_{CME} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{CME}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given value for $\\tau_{\\mathrm{CME}}$:\n$$\n\\nu_{CME} = \\frac{1}{15\\,\\mathrm{s}}\n$$\nThis rate, $\\frac{1}{15}$ vesicles per second, represents the maximum retrieval capacity of a single CME site.\n\nFinally, we compute the required dimensionless ratio, $R$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\nu_{obs}}{\\nu_{CME}}\n$$\nThis ratio quantifies how much faster the observed aggregate process is compared to the rate of a single molecular machine.

Therefore, implement orthogonal, target-selective and acute genetic tests: neuron-specific conditional double knockout of dynamin-1 and dynamin-3 in the mature brain (e.g., Cre recombinase activated post-development), acute sequestration of Adaptor Protein 2 via rapamycin-inducible “knocksideways,” and auxin-inducible degron–mediated acute degradation of clathrin heavy chain.

This means targeting different components of the same pathway (e.g., both clathrin coat formation and scission) using different methods.\n    4.  **Rescue**: The \"gold standard\" to prove an effect is on-target is to perform a rescue experiment, where function is restored by re-expressing a wild-type version of the protein that is immune to the initial perturbation.\n    5.  **Multi-modal Readout**: Combining functional data ($\\tau_{\\text{endo}}$) with structural data (electron microscopy to visualize coated pits, endosomes, etc.) provides a much more complete picture than either method alone.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A.

Increase each drug concentration by a factor of $2$ to maximize target engagement, and if $ \\tau_{\\text{endo}} $ slows further for all three, conclude CME is the dominant synaptic retrieval pathway. No additional controls are necessary beyond vehicle.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. It willfully ignores the foundational fact that these inhibitors have poor specificity.

It correctly identifies the off-target liabilities of each drug. It proposes an excellent set of orthogonal, specific, and acutely inducible genetic perturbations targeting the most relevant proteins (presynaptic dynamins, the core AP-2 adaptor, and clathrin itself). It correctly includes the principles of rescue experiments to confirm specificity and the use of both functional and structural readouts. The interpretive framework is logical and sound.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C.

Genetic manipulations targeting clathrin or Adaptor Protein 2 are unnecessary because cholesterol is required for clathrin-coated pits.**\nThis option is deeply flawed. Methyl-$\\beta$-cyclodextrin is a notoriously non-specific tool that disrupts the entire plasma membrane, affecting nearly all forms of trafficking, not just CME. It cannot be considered a \"selective CME probe.\" While caveolar endocytosis is likely not a major pathway here, ruling it out does not prove CME is the default. The assertion that direct genetic targeting of clathrin or AP-2 is \"unnecessary\" is antithetical to rigorous science and ignores the most specific tools available.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Overexpress the clathrin heavy chain “hub” fragment stably for $4$ weeks to inhibit clathrin function and, in parallel, apply chlorpromazine chronically to maintain Adaptor Protein 2 at the plasma membrane. If both conditions slow $ \\tau_{\\text{endo}} $, conclude CME is required; any cytotoxicity is acceptable because it reflects strong pathway inhibition rather than off-target effects.**\nThis option contains multiple severe errors. A $4$-week stable expression is a chronic perturbation, which invites confounding compensatory changes, violating the principle of acute temporal control. Chronic application of a non-specific and toxic drug like chlorpromazine is poor experimental design. The statement that \"any cytotoxicity is acceptable\" is scientifically indefensible. Cytotoxicity compromises cellular health and makes it impossible to interpret effects on a specific physiological process. It is a hallmark of off-target effects or system failure, not a sign of successful pathway inhibition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Knock out dynamin-2 only, because it is ubiquitous and therefore must carry synaptic endocytosis, and use Pitstop at a lower dose to avoid off-target effects. If either manipulation slows $ \\tau_{\\text{endo}} $, attribute the effect to CME specifically, since dynamin-2 acts downstream of clathrin in synapses.**\nThe reasoning in this option is faulty. The problem states that dynamin-1 and -3 are dominant at presynapses, making them the more relevant targets than the less abundant dynamin-2. The logic that ubiquity implies primary function in a specialized compartment is incorrect. Using Pitstop at a lower dose reduces but does not eliminate off-target concerns. Finally, attributing any dynamin-dependent phenotype solely to CME is an oversimplification, as dynamin is required for other endocytic pathways as well.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2709910"}]}
