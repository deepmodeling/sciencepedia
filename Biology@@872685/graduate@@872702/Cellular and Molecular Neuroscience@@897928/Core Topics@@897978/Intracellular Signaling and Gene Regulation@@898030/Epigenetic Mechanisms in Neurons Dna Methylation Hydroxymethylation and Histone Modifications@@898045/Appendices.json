To achieve this, we rearrange the equation.

It is the Langmuir isotherm for noncooperative binding to a single class of sites.\n\nNext, we compute the change in occupancy, $\\Delta \\theta = \\theta_{\\text{Mut}} - \\theta_{\\text{WT}}$.

The problem states that MeCP2 recruits co-repressor complexes. This identifies MeCP2 as a transcriptional repressor. The fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, quantifies the extent to which these repressor proteins are bound to their target sites on the chromatin. According to first principles of gene regulation, the magnitude of repression is functionally related to the occupancy of repressor binding sites. A decrease in $\\theta$ signifies that fewer MeCP2 molecules are bound to the DNA. This reduction in the concentration of bound repressor will alleviate the recruitment of co-repressor complexes, leading to a less condensed chromatin state.

H3K4me3 and its associated readers can inhibit de novo DNA methylation by reducing access or activity of DNA methyltransferases. Consequently, higher $H3K4me3$ could reduce subsequent methylation rather than methylation loss causing H3K4me3 gain, reversing the presumed causal arrow.\n\n$2.$ Measurement confounding by 5-hydroxymethylcytosine ($5\\text{hmC}$): Neurons accumulate substantial 5-hydroxymethylcytosine generated by Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) dioxygenases. Standard Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) does not distinguish 5-methylcytosine ($5\\text{mC}$) from $5\\text{hmC}$, so the measured “methylation” $X$ may conflate functionally distinct marks. Because $5\\text{hmC}$ can be enriched in active chromatin and may not repress CXXC binding as strongly as $5\\text{mC}$, the observed negative $r$ could be partly due to $5\\text{hmC}$-enriched active promoters rather than causal effects of $5\\text{mC}$ loss per se.\n\nAdditional non-exhaustive considerations include: omitted-variable confounding by transcriptional activity and nucleosome acetylation, CpG density differences between promoter classes (CpG islands versus non-islands) that jointly determine both low $5\\text{mC}$ and high $H3K4me3$, nonlinearity and heteroscedasticity violating simple linear model assumptions, and cell-state heterogeneity in neuronal populations. Therefore, while $r^{2}=0.36$ quantifies linear explanatory power, it does not establish that decreases in promoter DNA methylation cause increases in H3K4me3 in neurons without temporal, perturbational, and mark-resolving assays (for example, oxidative bisulfite sequencing and TET or DNA methyltransferase perturbations).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.36}$$", "id": "2710145"}]}
