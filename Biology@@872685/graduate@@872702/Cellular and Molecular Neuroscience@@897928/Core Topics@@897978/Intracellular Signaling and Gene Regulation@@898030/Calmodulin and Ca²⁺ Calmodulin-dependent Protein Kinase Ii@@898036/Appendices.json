We only need to compute the ratio of the sums, $\\frac{S_1}{S_2}$.\nGiven: $N=5$, $\\tau=0.10\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nCondition 1: $f_1 = 20\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, so $\\Delta_1 = 1/20\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nThe parameter $x_1$ is $x_1 = \\exp(-\\Delta_1/\\tau) = \\exp(-0.05/0.10) = \\exp(-0.5)$.\nCondition 2: $f_2 = 1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, so $\\Delta_2 = 1/1\\,\\mathrm{s} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nThe parameter $x_2$ is $x_2 = \\exp(-\\Delta_2/\\tau) = \\exp(-1.0/0.10) = \\exp(-10)$.\n\nWe need to compute $S(N=5, x_1)$ and $S(N=5, x_2)$. We use the summation form for calculation:\n$S(5, x) = 5 + 2\\sum_{m=1}^{4} (5-m)x^m = 5 + 2(4x + 3x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4)$.\n\nFor Condition 1:\n$S_1 = S(5, \\exp(-0.5)) = 5 + 8\\exp(-0.5) + 6\\exp(-1) + 4\\exp(-1.5) + 2\\exp(-2)$.\nUsing numerical values:\n$\\exp(-0.5) \\approx 0.60653066$\n$\\exp(-1.0) \\approx 0.36787944$\n$\\exp(-1.5) \\approx 0.22313016$\n$\\exp(-2.0) \\approx 0.13533528$\n$S_1 \\approx 5 + 8(0.60653066) + 6(0.36787944) + 4(0.22313016) + 2(0.13533528)$\n$S_1 \\approx 5 + 4.85224528 + 2.20727664 + 0.89252064 + 0.27067056$\n$S_1 \\approx 13.22271312$\n\nFor Condition 2:\n$S_2 = S(5, \\exp(-10)) = 5 + 8\\exp(-10) + 6\\exp(-20) + 4\\exp(-30) + 2\\exp(-40)$.\nThe value of $x_2 = \\exp(-10) \\approx 4.53999 \\times 10^{-5}$ is very small. The higher-order terms are negligible.\n$S_2 \\approx 5 + 8\\exp(-10) \\approx 5 + 8(4.53999 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 5 + 0.000363199$\n$S_2 \\approx 5.00036320$\n\nThe ratio is:\n$$R = \\frac{S_1}{S_2} \\approx \\frac{13.22271312}{5.00036320} \\approx 2.6443425$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is $2.644$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.644}$$", "id": "2703280"}]}
