The problem is self-contained, objective, and does not violate any physical or biological principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe translocation of PKCα to the plasma membrane, measured by $M(t)$, is contingent upon the simultaneous fulfillment of two conditions as stated in principle (i): the presence of $\\text{DAG}$ in the membrane and an elevation of cytosolic free calcium ion concentration, $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{cyt}}$. The temporal profile of $M(t)$ will therefore be a function of the co-occurrence of these two second messengers.\n\n1.  **Generation of Second Messengers**: The mGluR agonist activates $\\text{PLC}\\beta$, which produces both $\\text{DAG}$ and $\\text{IP}_3$. The problem states that the production waveforms for these messengers are comparable in both control and test conditions. $\\text{DAG}$ is lipid-soluble and remains in the plasma membrane. $\\text{IP}_3$ is water-soluble and diffuses into the cytosol.\n\n2.  **Calcium Dynamics in Control Condition (extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ present)**:\n    *   The initial phase of the $Ca^{2+}$ signal is driven by $\\text{IP}_3$ binding to its receptors on the ER, causing a rapid release of stored $Ca^{2+}$ into the cytosol. This results in a sharp, transient increase in $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{cyt}}$.\n    *   This initial rise, in conjunction with the presence of $\\text{DAG}$, triggers the initial translocation of PKCα to the membrane. This defines the onset and rising phase of $M(t)$.\n    *   Following the initial ER release, principle (iii) states that a sustained influx of extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ occurs via pathways like SOCE. This influx maintains $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{cyt}}$ at an elevated level (a plateau or oscillations) for a prolonged period.\n    *   As long as both $\\text{DAG}$ and elevated $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{cyt}}$ persist, PKCα remains bound to the membrane, producing a sustained phase in the $M(t)$ signal.\n\n3.  **Calcium Dynamics in Test Condition ($0$ extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ with EGTA)**:\n    *   The initial signaling events are unchanged. $\\text{PLC}\\beta$ activation produces $\\text{DAG}$ and $\\text{IP}_3$. The $\\text{IP}_3$-mediated release of $Ca^{2+}$ from the ER is an intracellular event and remains intact.\n    *   Therefore, an initial, rapid rise in $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{cyt}}$ will still occur. In conjunction with $\\text{DAG}$, this is sufficient to trigger the initial translocation of PKCα. Consequently, the **onset latency** and **initial peak amplitude** of $M(t)$ should be largely unaffected and thus similar to the control condition.\n    *   However, the crucial difference lies in the subsequent phase. Since extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ is absent, there can be no $Ca^{2+}$ influx through SOCE or other channels. The only source of the $Ca^{2+}$ signal is the finite pool within the ER.\n    *   Once released, this $Ca^{2+}$ is actively removed from the cytosol by pumps such as the Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum $Ca^{2+}$-ATPase (SERCA) and the Plasma Membrane $Ca^{2+}$-ATPase (PMCA). Without a compensatory influx to replenish it, the cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$ concentration will rapidly return to its resting level.\n    *   This means the **sustained phase of elevated $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{cyt}}$ is abolished**.\n    *   As $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{cyt}}$ falls, the dual requirement for PKCα membrane binding is no longer met, even if $\\text{DAG}$ is still present. PKCα will dissociate from the membrane. This leads to an **accelerated decay** of the $M(t)$ signal compared to the control condition, where sustained $Ca^{2+}$ influx prolongs the signal.\n    *   The overall effect is a briefer translocation event. The area under the $M(t)$ curve, which represents the total integrated time PKCα spends at the membrane, will be **significantly reduced**.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Onset latency of $M(t)$ is similar to control, the initial peak amplitude is near control because ER $Ca^{2+}$ release is intact, but the sustained phase is lost and the decay is accelerated due to the absence of $Ca^{2+}$ entry; the integrated membrane dwell time (area under $M(t)$) is reduced.**\n    This option precisely matches the derived conclusions. The initial phase, driven by intracellular stores, is preserved. The sustained phase, dependent on extracellular influx, is lost. This leads to faster decay and reduced total membrane time.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Onset of $M(t)$ is markedly delayed and the peak strongly reduced because $Ca^{2+}$ influx is the primary trigger for PKCα binding; the sustained phase remains because $\\text{DAG}$ alone is sufficient to maintain PKCα at the membrane.**\n    This option is incorrect on multiple grounds. The onset is not delayed, as it is triggered by ER release, which is intact. The assertion that \"$Ca^{2+}$ influx is the primary trigger\" is false for the initial phase of the response. Furthermore, the claim that $\\text{DAG}$ alone is sufficient to maintain a conventional PKC at the membrane contradicts the given principle (i), which specifies a dual requirement for both $Ca^{2+}$ and $\\text{DAG}$.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. PKCα translocation is abolished; both the initial peak and any sustained component disappear because PKC strictly requires extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ to activate.**\n    This option incorrectly assumes that PKCα activation is entirely dependent on extracellular $Ca^{2+}$. It dismisses the critical role of $\\text{IP}_3$-mediated $Ca^{2+}$ release from intracellular ER stores, which is sufficient to trigger the initial translocation event. Therefore, translocation is not abolished, but rather becomes transient.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Both onset and peak of $M(t)$ are enhanced, and decay is prolonged, because removal of extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ increases $\\text{PLC}\\beta$ activity and reduces $Ca^{2+}$ extrusion, thereby amplifying and sustaining PKCα membrane association.**\n    This option relies on flawed premises. There is no general principle stating that removal of extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ enhances Gq-linked $\\text{PLC}\\beta$ activity; the problem even states $\\text{DAG}$/$\\text{IP}_3$ production is comparable. The claim that $Ca^{2+}$ extrusion is reduced is also false; the PMCA pump that extrudes $Ca^{2+}$ does not require extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ to function and would, in the absence of influx, more efficiently clear the cytosol of $Ca^{2+}$. The predictions of enhanced peak and prolonged decay are the opposite of the correct biophysical result.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2766471"}]}
