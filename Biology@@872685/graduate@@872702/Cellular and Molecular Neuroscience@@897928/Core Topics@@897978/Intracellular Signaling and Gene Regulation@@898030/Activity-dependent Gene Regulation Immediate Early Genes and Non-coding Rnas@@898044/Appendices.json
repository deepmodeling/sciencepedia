Precision Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq) measures nascent transcription and provides read densities corresponding to polymerase occupancy. A commonly used metric of promoter-proximal pausing is the pausing index, defined here as the ratio of the promoter-proximal PRO-seq signal to the gene body PRO-seq signal. Specifically, let the pausing index be $PI = \\frac{R_{p}}{R_{g}}$, where $R_{p}$ is the length- and library-normalized read count in a promoter-proximal window and $R_{g}$ is the length- and library-normalized read count in the gene body window.

The concepts of immediate early genes (e.g., *Fos*), RNA polymerase II pausing, and the use of PRO-seq to measure nascent transcription are standard and factually correct. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and numerical data for a unique solution. The language is objective and unambiguous. The data values are plausible for normalized sequencing counts. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and does not violate any criteria for invalidity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Conceptual Justification**\n\nThe Central Dogma of molecular biology states that genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. The critical step of transcription, the synthesis of RNA from a DNA template, is the primary point of regulation for gene expression. In eukaryotes, this process is catalyzed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Transcription is not a simple, uniform process; it is highly regulated at multiple stages, including initiation, elongation, and termination.\n\nA key regulatory checkpoint occurs shortly after transcription initiation. Pol II often pauses approximately $20-60$ base pairs downstream of the transcription start site. This phenomenon is known as promoter-proximal pausing. For a gene to be expressed productively, Pol II must be released from this paused state to enter productive elongation, where it transcribes the full length of the gene body.\n\nThe technique of Precision Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq) provides a high-resolution, genome-wide snapshot of the locations of transcriptionally engaged Pol II. The density of PRO-seq reads in a specific genomic region is directly proportional to the occupancy of active polymerases in that region.\n\nConsequently, we can use PRO-seq data to quantify the extent of pausing. The signal in the promoter-proximal region, $R_{p}$, measures the number of polymerases that have initiated but are stalled. The signal in the gene body, $R_{g}$, measures the number of polymerases that have escaped the pause and are actively elongating.\n\nThe pausing index, defined as $PI = \\frac{R_{p}}{R_{g}}$, is therefore a ratio that quantifies the \"traffic jam\" of polymerases at the promoter relative to the \"flow\" of polymerases through the gene. A high $PI$ indicates that many polymerases accumulate at the pause site with inefficient release into the gene body, signifying that pause-release is a rate-limiting step. Conversely, a low $PI$ indicates efficient release from the pause site and a high rate of productive elongation.\n\nIn the context of activity-dependent regulation of immediate early genes like *Fos*, neuronal stimulation must trigger a rapid and robust increase in an otherwise low basal transcription rate. Many of these genes are pre-loaded with paused Pol II under basal conditions. This state is characterized by a high $PI$. Upon stimulation, cellular signaling cascades converge on transcription factors that promote the release of this paused Pol II. This massive release into productive elongation leads to a sharp increase in full-length transcripts. This mechanism allows for a much faster response than recruiting and assembling new Pol II complexes from scratch.\n\nTherefore, a change in the $PI$ upon stimulation directly reflects this modulation of the pause-release step. A decrease in $PI$ signifies a shift from a \"poised\" state to a \"productively transcribing\" state, driven by an enhancement of the elongation rate relative to the density of paused polymerases.\n\n**Calculation**\n\nFirst, we calculate the pausing index before stimulation, denoted as $PI_{\\text{before}}$. The given values are $R_{p, \\text{before}} = 10{,}000$ and $R_{g, \\text{before}} = 5{,}000$.\n$$\nPI_{\\text{before}} = \\frac{R_{p, \\text{before}}}{R_{g, \\text{before}}} = \\frac{10{,}000}{5{,}000} = 2\n$$\nNext, we calculate the pausing index after stimulation, denoted as $PI_{\\text{after}}$. The given values are $R_{p, \\text{after}} = 8{,}000$ and $R_{g, \\text{after}} = 40{,}000$.\n$$\nPI_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{R_{p, \\text{after}}}{R_{g, \\text{after}}} = \\frac{8{,}000}{40{,}000} = \\frac{8}{40} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2\n$$\nThe decrease in the pausing index from $2$ to $0.2$ is consistent with the release of paused Pol II into productive elongation upon neuronal stimulation. The promoter-proximal density has slightly decreased, while the gene body density has increased dramatically (by a factor of $8$), indicating a massive flux of polymerase through the gene.\n\nFinally, we compute the fold-change, $FC$, in the pausing index.\n$$\nFC = \\frac{PI_{\\text{after}}}{PI_{\\text{before}}} = \\frac{0.2}{2} = 0.1\n$$\nThe pausing index decreased by a factor of $10$, which is reported as a fold-change of $0.1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1}\n$$", "id": "2697296"}, {"introduction": "The regulation of gene expression extends well beyond the synthesis of messenger RNA.

The experimental techniques—ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing—are standard methods for quantifying genome-wide translation and transcription. *Npas4* is a well-established activity-regulated immediate early gene. MiR-9 is a prominent brain-enriched microRNA, and its role in regulating neuronal gene expression is a subject of intense research. The core concepts of translational control, miRNA-mediated silencing, and the definition of translation efficiency are all central to modern molecular biology.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. The provided data are sufficient to deduce a logical, parsimonious mechanism. The observations are:\n1.  Ribosome footprints on *Npas4* mRNA $\\uparrow$\n2.  *Npas4* mRNA abundance $\\leftrightarrow$ (constant)\n\nThe definition of translation efficiency ($TE$) is given as:\n$$TE \\propto \\frac{\\text{Ribosome Footprints}}{\\text{mRNA Abundance}}$$\nGiven the observations, we can deduce:\n$$TE \\propto \\frac{\\uparrow}{\\leftrightarrow} \\implies TE \\uparrow$$\nThe problem is thus to explain an increase in translational efficiency. This is a non-trivial but solvable question in molecular logic.\n\nThe problem contains no scientific or factual unsoundness, is not metaphorical, is directly relevant to the specified topic, and is not incomplete or contradictory. The statement that *Npas4* is an immediate early gene yet its mRNA does not increase is not a contradiction; it is a key piece of data pointing away from a transcriptional mechanism and toward a post-transcriptional or translational one within the specified \"acute time window.\" The problem is objective and verifiable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Mechanism and Prediction**\n\nThe central observation is an increase in the translation efficiency of *Npas4* mRNA upon neuronal stimulation. An increase in translation efficiency implies that each individual mRNA molecule is translated more frequently, which is typically accomplished by increasing the rate of translation initiation. An increased initiation rate leads to a higher density of ribosomes on the mRNA, which is precisely what is observed with ribosome profiling (increased footprint density).\n\nThe problem provides a critical clue: Argonaute protein, the catalytic core of the miRISC, occupies sites for miR-9 in the 3' UTR of *Npas4* mRNA. The canonical function of miRISC, when guided by a miRNA like miR-9 to a target mRNA, is repressive. This repression is executed through two primary, non-mutually exclusive mechanisms:\n1.  **Translational Repression:** The miRISC machinery interferes with translation, predominantly at the initiation step, by hindering the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit or the interaction of initiation factors with the 5' cap structure.\n2.  **mRNA Destabilization:** The miRISC recruits deadenylase complexes, which shorten the poly(A) tail of the mRNA, marking it for subsequent degradation.\n\nTherefore, under basal conditions (before stimulation), it is logical to infer that miR-9 is actively repressing the translation of *Npas4* mRNA.\n\nThe experimental stimulus is neuronal activity. This activity leads to an increase in *Npas4* translation. The most parsimonious mechanism that connects these facts is that neuronal activity triggers a signaling pathway that alleviates the miR-9-mediated repression. This \"de-repression\" lifts the brake on translation initiation. Consequently, ribosomes can be loaded onto the *Npas4* mRNA at a higher rate, increasing ribosome density (footprints) and protein synthesis, all without any change in the total amount of mRNA, consistent with all observations.\n\nNow, we must predict the effect of miR-9 overexpression. Overexpression artificially increases the concentration of the repressive agent (the miR-9/miRISC complex). According to principles of mass action, this will enhance the repression of the *Npas4* target. Even in the face of a stimulus that attempts to de-repress the system, the overwhelming amount of repressor will blunt or overcome this effect.\n- **Effect on Ribosome Occupancy:** The enhanced repression will inhibit translation initiation. Therefore, the activity-dependent increase in ribosome footprint density will be reduced or abolished. The prediction is a **reduction in *Npas4* ribosome footprint density** compared to the stimulated control without miR-9 overexpression.\n- **Effect on Polysome Association:** Polysomes are mRNAs associated with multiple ribosomes. Efficient initiation leads to loading of many ribosomes and association with \"heavy\" polysome fractions in a sucrose gradient. Inhibition of initiation causes mRNAs to shift toward \"lighter\" polysome fractions or to the monosome (1 ribosome) fraction. Therefore, miR-9 overexpression will cause a **shift of *Npas4* mRNA toward lighter polysomes**.\n- **Effect on mRNA Abundance:** The second canonical function of miRISCs is to promote mRNA decay. Overexpressing miR-9 will likely enhance this activity. While the experiment is conducted in an \"acute time window,\" a strong perturbation like overexpression is expected to accelerate mRNA degradation. Thus, we predict a **decrease in *Npas4* mRNA abundance**, which might be modest if the translational effects are more rapid than the decay kinetics.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Activity-dependent enhancement of translation initiation increases *Npas4* translation efficiency without changing mRNA abundance; miR-9 overexpression would reduce *Npas4* ribosome footprint density and shift *Npas4* mRNA toward lighter polysomes, with at most a modest decrease in *Npas4* mRNA over the same acute time window.**\n- **Mechanism:** This aligns perfectly with our derivation. \"Enhancement of translation initiation\" is the direct consequence of relieving miR-9-mediated repression. It explains the increase in translation efficiency and is consistent with constant mRNA abundance.\n- **Prediction:** This prediction matches our analysis precisely. Reduced ribosome density, a shift to lighter polysomes, and a potential decrease in mRNA are all expected consequences of bolstering the repressive miRNA.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Primary transcriptional induction of *Npas4* increases mRNA abundance, which drives higher ribosome occupancy; miR-9 overexpression would have no effect because microRNAs act only post-translationally and do not influence ribosome loading.**\n- **Mechanism:** This directly contradicts the experimental observation that *Npas4* mRNA abundance does not change.\n- **Prediction:** This contains a fundamentally false statement. MicroRNAs act post-transcriptionally, but they absolutely do influence translation and ribosome loading; this is a primary mechanism of their function.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Ribosome elongation is slowed on *Npas4*, causing ribosome pile-up and increased footprint density with no change in mRNA; miR-9 overexpression would further increase ribosome footprint density and elevate *Npas4* protein output.**\n- **Mechanism:** While slowed elongation could increase ribosome density, it would typically decrease the overall rate of protein synthesis. This is not the most parsimonious mechanism for upregulating a key transcription factor.\n- **Prediction:** The prediction is diametrically opposed to the known repressive function of miRNAs. Overexpressing a repressive miRNA (miR-9) would not increase ribosome density or protein output; it would do the opposite.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Activity-dependent stabilization of *Npas4* mRNA increases its half-life without changing translation efficiency; miR-9 overexpression would increase cap-independent translation of *Npas4* via an internal ribosome entry site, raising ribosome occupancy despite reduced mRNA stability.**\n- **Mechanism:** \"Without changing translation efficiency\" is a direct contradiction of the necessary inference from the data ($TE \\uparrow$). Moreover, if mRNA is stabilized, its steady-state level should increase, which contradicts the observation of constant mRNA abundance (unless transcription is simultaneously and precisely downregulated, which is not parsimonious).\n- **Prediction:** This invokes a non-canonical, activating role for miR-9 and an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) for which no evidence is provided. The canonical repressive role is sufficient and more parsimonious. The prediction of *increased* ribosome occupancy is contrary to the expected repressive function.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nThe only option that is consistent with all provided data and established molecular principles is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2697311"}, {"introduction": "Following a stimulus, a neuron doesn't just activate genes; it orchestrates a precisely timed sequence of protein expression to manage complex processes like synaptic plasticity.

Our calculation for *Npas4* gives $T_{\\text{Npas4}} \\approx 199.3$ minutes, which is within the stated range of $180$–$210$ minutes. The qualitative description follows directly: the synthesis of *Fos* protein is rapid and largely complete within about an hour, indicative of a role in early, transient processes. The synthesis of *Npas4* protein is much more prolonged, suggesting a role in later, more sustained processes. While the window for *Npas4* also starts at $t=0$ and is not strictly \"later\", it is \"more prolonged\", and its contribution to protein levels extends to later times than that of *Fos*. This statement is the most accurate description.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. *Fos* and *Npas4* share essentially identical effective synthesis windows because their translation rates per mRNA are the same; both are concentrated in the first $\\sim 120$ minutes.**\nThis is fundamentally incorrect. The derivation shows that the synthesis window $T$ is directly proportional to the mRNA half-life ($T \\propto t_{1/2}$). Since $t_{1/2,\\text{Fos}} \\neq t_{1/2,\\text{Npas4}}$, their synthesis windows cannot be identical. The translation rate $k$ cancels out of the calculation for $T$. The calculated windows are approximately $66$ minutes and $199$ minutes, respectively, not identical and not both concentrated in the first $\\sim 120$ minutes.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Because faster mRNA decay delays protein accumulation, *Fos*’s protein impact peaks later than *Npas4*’s; *Fos*’s window extends beyond $240$ minutes, whereas *Npas4* is confined mostly to the first $60$ minutes.**\nThis statement makes a physically nonsensical claim: \"faster mRNA decay delays protein accumulation\". Faster decay means the template for translation (the mRNA) is removed more quickly, thus leading to a *faster* cessation of protein synthesis and an *earlier* and *briefer* synthesis window. This option has the logic and the numerical values reversed. *Fos* has the shorter window ($\\approx 66$ min), not one extending beyond $240$ minutes. *Npas4* has the longer window ($\\approx 199$ min), not one confined to the first $60$ minutes.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The difference is reversed: *Npas4* has the earlier, transient window (approximately the first $60$ minutes), while *Fos* exhibits the later, prolonged window (approximately $180$–$210$ minutes).**\nThis statement incorrectly swaps the properties of the two genes. *Npas4* has the longer half-life ($60$ min) and therefore the longer synthesis window ($\\approx 199$ min). *Fos* has the shorter half-life ($20$ min) and therefore the shorter synthesis window ($\\approx 66$ min).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Without knowing protein half-lives, it is not possible to infer any relative timing of *Fos* versus *Npas4* protein influence from the mRNA half-lives alone under these conditions.**\nThis is incorrect. The problem explicitly directs us to estimate when most protein is *synthesized*, defining an \"effective synthesis window\" for this purpose. The calculation of this window depends only on mRNA kinetics. The problem further states that protein degradation can be neglected for this estimation. Therefore, a valid inference about the relative timing of protein synthesis, and consequently its initial influence, can and must be made from the given mRNA half-lives.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2697271"}]}
