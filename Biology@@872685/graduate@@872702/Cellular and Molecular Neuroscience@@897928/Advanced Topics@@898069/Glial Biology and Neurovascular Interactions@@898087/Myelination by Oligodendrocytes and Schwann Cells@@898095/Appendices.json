Consider a cylindrical axon of diameter $d$ and radius $a=d/2$, with intracellular specific resistivity $\\rho_{i}$, membrane specific resistance $R_{m}$, and membrane specific capacitance $C_{m}$. For unmyelinated axons, the axial resistance per unit length and membrane parameters are determined by these specific properties and the cylinder geometry. For myelinated axons, conduction is saltatory between nodes of Ranvier, with internodal length set by developmental programs that couple internode spacing to axon caliber.\n\nStarting from the following well-tested bases:\n- The axial resistance per unit length is $r_{i}'=\\rho_{i}/(\\pi a^{2})$.\n- The membrane resistance per unit length is $r_{m}'=R_{m}/(2\\pi a)$, and the membrane capacitance per unit length is $c_{m}'=2\\pi a\\,C_{m}$.\n- The space constant is $\\lambda=\\sqrt{r_{m}'/r_{i}'}$ and the membrane time constant is $\\tau=R_{m}C_{m}$ for unmyelinated axons with uniform membrane properties.\n- In myelinated axons, conduction between nodes can be idealized as saltatory steps over internode length $L$, with an approximately diameter-independent nodal charging time $t_{n}$, while $L$ scales with diameter through developmental patterning, $L=\\alpha d$ for some constant $\\alpha$.\n\nUse these bases to argue the scaling of conduction velocity with $d$ for both unmyelinated and myelinated axons.

No rounding is necessary.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. We begin by justifying the scaling relationships provided.\n\nFirst, consider the unmyelinated axon. The conduction velocity $v$ scales with the space constant $\\lambda$ and inversely with the membrane time constant $\\tau$. From the given definitions:\nThe space constant is $\\lambda = \\sqrt{r_{m}'/r_{i}'}$. Substituting the expressions for resistance per unit length:\n$$ \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m}/(2\\pi a)}{\\rho_{i}/(\\pi a^{2})}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m} \\pi a^{2}}{2\\pi a \\rho_{i}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m} a}{2\\rho_{i}}} $$\nSince the axon radius $a$ is half the diameter $d$, $a = d/2$, we have:\n$$ \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m} (d/2)}{2\\rho_{i}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m} d}{4\\rho_{i}}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{R_m}{\\rho_i}}\\right) \\sqrt{d} $$\nThe membrane time constant is $\\tau = R_{m}C_{m}$. This quantity depends only on the specific membrane properties and is independent of the axon's geometry, i.e., its diameter $d$.\nConduction velocity in a continuous cable is proportional to $\\lambda/\\tau$. Given that $\\tau$ is constant with respect to diameter and $\\lambda \\propto \\sqrt{d}$, it follows that the conduction velocity $v_{\\mathrm{unmy}}$ scales with the square root of the diameter:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{unmy}}(d) \\propto \\sqrt{d} $$\nThis justifies the provided functional form $v_{\\mathrm{unmy}}(d)=k\\,\\sqrt{d/d_{\\mathrm{ref}}}$.\n\nNext, consider the myelinated axon. Conduction is saltatory, with the action potential \"jumping\" between nodes of Ranvier. The velocity is approximately the internode length $L$ divided by the time required to excite the subsequent node. This time is primarily determined by the nodal charging time, $t_{n}$, which is given as being approximately independent of diameter. The internode length $L$ is stated to scale linearly with diameter, $L = \\alpha d$.\nTherefore, the conduction velocity $v_{\\mathrm{my}}$ is:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{my}}(d) \\approx \\frac{L}{t_{n}} = \\frac{\\alpha d}{t_{n}} = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{t_{n}}\\right) d $$\nSince $\\alpha$ and $t_{n}$ are treated as constants, the velocity scales linearly with diameter:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{my}}(d) \\propto d $$\nThis justifies the provided functional form $v_{\\mathrm{my}}(d)=k\\,\\big(d/d_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\big)$.\n\nThe problem now reduces to a quantitative calculation using the provided formulas and data.

A mixed-fiber peripheral nerve is considered.\n2.  The nerve contains three partially overlapping axon-diameter populations.\n3.  The empirical distributions of these populations are approximately symmetric and unimodal.\n4.  The mean axon diameters for the three populations are $d_1 = 0.7\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, $d_2 = 1.2\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, and $d_3 = 2.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n5.

Axons with diameters smaller than this threshold are ensheathed non-myelinatingly in Remak bundles.\n8.  A molecular mechanism is described: axonal Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) type III signaling, through ErbB receptors on Schwann cells, influences the myelination versus non-myelination decision.\n9.  Higher levels of axonal NRG1 type III promote myelination and result in thicker myelin.\n10. Lower levels of axonal NRG1 type III favor non-myelinating ensheathment.\n11. For contrast, central nervous system (CNS) oligodendrocytes are stated to have a weaker dependence on NRG1 for initiating myelination.\n12. The problem assumes the stated threshold-based rule applies and that the mean diameters are representative of the bulk of each population.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the criteria for validity.\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded**: The statements are consistent with established principles of cellular and molecular neuroscience. The distinction between PNS (Schwann cells) and CNS (oligodendrocytes) myelination is fundamental. The existence of an axon diameter threshold of approximately $1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ for myelination by Schwann cells is a well-documented empirical rule. The role of Neuregulin-1 type III as a primary axonal signal that regulates Schwann cell myelination, influencing both the decision to myelinate and myelin thickness, is a cornerstone of modern glial biology. The axon diameter values provided are physiologically realistic for a mixed peripheral nerve, representing unmyelinated C-fibers (around $0.7\\,\\mu\\text{m}$) and myelinated A-delta/A-beta fibers ($> 1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$). The problem is scientifically sound.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides clear data (mean diameters), a primary rule (threshold), and a modulating factor (NRG1 signaling). The question asks for an estimation based on these premises, which requires integrating the concepts. A unique best answer among the options can be logically deduced.\n*   **Objective**: The language is objective and devoid of subjective or non-scientific claims.\n*   **Complete and Consistent**: The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary information and assumptions required to answer the question. The premises are internally consistent. The apparent vagueness in \"about $1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$\" is not a flaw; rather, it is clarified by the introduction of the NRG1 mechanism, which explains the biological basis for plasticity around this threshold.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically accurate, logically consistent, and well-posed. A solution can be derived from the provided information.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution requires a two-step analysis based on the provided principles.\n\n**Step 1: Application of the Diameter Threshold Rule**\nThe primary rule states that in the PNS, Schwann cells myelinate axons with a diameter $d$ that exceeds a threshold, $d_{thresh} \\approx 1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$. We are to take the mean diameters as representative of each population.\n\n*   For the first population, the mean diameter is $d_1 = 0.7\\,\\mu\\text{m}$. Since $0.7\\,\\mu\\text{m} < 1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, this population will be predominantly unmyelinated and ensheathed in Remak bundles.\n*   For the second population, the mean diameter is $d_2 = 1.2\\,\\mu\\text{m}$. Since $1.2\\,\\mu\\text{m} > 1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, this population will be predominantly myelinated.\n*   For the third population, the mean diameter is $d_3 = 2.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}$. Since $2.5\\,\\mu\\text{m} > 1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, this population will also be predominantly myelinated.\n\nThus, based on the simple size rule, the populations with mean diameters of $1.2\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ and $2.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ are expected to be myelinated, while the $0.7\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ population is not.\n\n**Step 2: Integration of the NRG1 Signaling Mechanism**\nThe problem states that the myelination decision is a \"fate decision\" biased by NRG1 type III levels. This implies the $1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ threshold is not a rigid, absolute cutoff but an operational threshold that can be modulated.\n\n*   \"Higher axonal NRG1 type III promotes myelination.\" This means that for an axon near the threshold, higher-than-average NRG1 expression can trigger myelination even if its diameter is at or slightly below $1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$. This effectively lowers the operational diameter threshold for myelination. For the population with mean diameter $0.7\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, the larger axons in its distribution (which are still likely below $1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ but close to it) could become myelinated if their NRG1 levels are sufficiently high.\n*   \"Lower levels [of NRG1] favor non-myelinating ensheathment.\" This means that for an axon with a diameter just above the threshold, lower-than-average NRG1 expression might prevent myelination. This effectively raises the operational diameter threshold. For the population with mean diameter $1.2\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, the smaller axons in its distribution could fail to be myelinated if their NRG1 levels are low.\n\nThis mechanism accounts for plasticity and explains why the threshold is not absolute. Changes in axonal NRG1 levels can shift the fate of axons with diameters close to the $1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ boundary.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Only the $2.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ population will be myelinated; the $1.2\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ population will remain unmyelinated unless neuronal activity increases conduction demand. NRG1 is oligodendrocyte-specific and does not regulate Schwann cell myelination in the PNS.**\nThis statement is incorrect for multiple reasons. Firstly, it incorrectly claims the $1.2\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ population will be unmyelinated, which contradicts the given threshold rule ($1.2\\,\\mu\\text{m} > 1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$). Secondly, it makes a factually incorrect assertion that \"NRG1 is oligodendrocyte-specific,\" which directly contradicts the problem's premise that NRG1 signaling through ErbB receptors on Schwann cells regulates myelination in the PNS.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The $1.2\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ and $2.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ populations will be predominantly myelinated, while the $0.7\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ population will be predominantly unmyelinated; moreover, higher axonal NRG1 type III can effectively lower the operational threshold so that some $0.7\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ axons become myelinated, whereas lower NRG1 can raise the threshold and leave a subset of $1.2\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ axons unmyelinated.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with the derived solution. The first part correctly applies the basic diameter threshold rule to the three populations. The second part accurately describes the mechanistic role of NRG1 as a modulator of this threshold, explaining how higher NRG1 can promote myelination for axons that might otherwise be unmyelinated (effectively lowering the threshold) and how lower NRG1 can prevent myelination for axons that might otherwise be myelinated (effectively raising the threshold). This correctly captures the concept of plasticity around the threshold.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. All three populations will be myelinated because oligodendrocytes can myelinate small axons below $1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ provided the g-ratio is maintained; NRG1 only determines myelin thickness and does not influence the decision to myelinate.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It incorrectly asserts that all populations will be myelinated, ignoring the PNS threshold. It brings in oligodendrocytes, which are irrelevant to a peripheral nerve. Most critically, it falsely claims that \"NRG1 only determines myelin thickness and does not influence the decision to myelinate,\" which is in direct contradiction to the provided statement that NRG1 \"biases the myelinating versus non-myelinating fate decision.\"\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Only the $1.2\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ population will be myelinated because $2.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ axons are too large for a single Schwann cell; NRG1 reduces the myelination threshold exclusively in the CNS but not in the PNS.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The claim that \"$2.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ axons are too large\" is biologically false; Schwann cells can and do myelinate much larger axons. The statement that NRG1's effect on the threshold is exclusive to the CNS is also a direct contradiction of the problem's explicit description of NRG1's role in the PNS.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The $0.7\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ and $1.2\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ populations will be unmyelinated and bundled in Remak configurations; only the $2.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ population will be myelinated, and NRG1 type III cannot influence the binary decision to myelinate but acts only during remyelination after injury.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It incorrectly classifies the $1.2\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ population as unmyelinated. Furthermore, it incorrectly limits the role of NRG1 by stating it \"cannot influence the binary decision to myelinate,\" a direct contradiction of the given information.

First, to compute the g-ratio from given dimensions. Second, to qualitatively assess if this computed value is consistent with the principle of maximizing saltatory conduction velocity, based on fundamental biophysical dependencies. The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information.\n\nPart (a): Computation of the g-ratio.\n\nThe g-ratio, denoted by $g$, is defined as the ratio of the inner axon diameter, $d_i$, to the outer fiber diameter, $d_o$. The formula is:\n$$g = \\frac{d_i}{d_o}$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\nInner diameter, $d_i = 4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nOuter diameter, $d_o = 6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the definition:\n$$g = \\frac{4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}$$\nThe units of micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) cancel, confirming that the g-ratio is a dimensionless quantity.\n$$g = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nTo express this as a decimal rounded to three significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$g = 0.6666...$$\nRounding to three significant figures yields:\n$$g \\approx 0.667$$\n\nPart (b): Qualitative assessment of the g-ratio's optimality.\n\nThe goal is to assess whether the computed g-ratio, $g \\approx 0.667$, is consistent with values predicted to maximize the velocity of saltatory conduction. The assessment must be based on the provided physical dependencies for a fixed outer diameter $d_o$.\n\nSaltatory conduction velocity is maximized by optimizing the trade-off between two key electrical properties of the myelinated internode: the axial resistance per unit length, $r_a$, and the capacitance per unit length, $C'$.\n\n$1$. The dependence of axial resistance on the g-ratio:\nThe axial resistance, $r_a$, is the resistance to current flow along the axoplasm. It is given to scale as $r_a \\propto 1/d_i^2$. Since $d_i = g \\cdot d_o$ and $d_o$ is fixed, the inner diameter $d_i$ is directly proportional to $g$. Therefore, the axial resistance scales with $g$ as:\n$$r_a \\propto \\frac{1}{(g \\cdot d_o)^2} \\propto \\frac{1}{g^2}$$\nTo maximize conduction velocity, the axial current must spread efficiently. This requires minimizing the axial resistance $r_a$. To minimize $r_a$, the value of $g$ must be maximized. This corresponds to having the widest possible axon core within the fixed outer diameter, which implies having the thinnest possible myelin sheath.\n\n$2$. The dependence of capacitance on the g-ratio:\nThe internodal membrane and surrounding myelin sheath act as a cylindrical capacitor. The capacitance per unit length, $C'$, determines how quickly the membrane potential can change in response to current flow. It is given to scale as $C' \\propto 1/\\ln(1/g)$. To maximize conduction velocity, the time required to charge the membrane capacitance must be minimized. This requires minimizing $C'$. To minimize $C'$, its denominator, $\\ln(1/g)$, must be maximized. The logarithmic function is monotonically increasing, so we must maximize its argument, $1/g$. This is achieved by minimizing the g-ratio, $g$. A smaller $g$ corresponds to a thicker myelin sheath, which provides better electrical insulation and thus a lower capacitance.\n\n$3$. The trade-off and optimal g-ratio:\nWe have identified two conflicting requirements for maximizing conduction velocity under a fixed outer diameter:\n- Minimizing axial resistance ($r_a$) requires maximizing $g$.\n- Minimizing capacitance ($C'$) requires minimizing $g$.\n\nThis fundamental trade-off implies that there must exist an optimal, intermediate value of $g$ where conduction velocity is maximal. If $g$ is too large (approaching $1$), the myelin sheath is too thin, capacitance becomes excessively high, and the insulating properties are lost. If $g$ is too small (approaching $0$), the axon core is too narrow, axial resistance becomes excessively high, and longitudinal current flow is impeded.\n\nTheoretical models based on these principles, first developed by W. A. H. Rushton, predict that the optimal g-ratio that maximizes conduction velocity is approximately $g_{\\text{opt}} \\approx 0.6$. Our computed value from part (a) is $g \\approx 0.667$. This value is close to the theoretical optimum. Empirical observations of myelinated fibers across the central and peripheral nervous systems consistently show g-ratios clustering in the range of $0.6$ to $0.7$.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that the computed g-ratio of approximately $0.667$ aligns well with the value predicted to maximize, or nearly maximize, saltatory conduction velocity. This suggests that the axon's morphology represents an efficient biological design for rapid signal propagation. The empirical relationship $L \\propto d_o$ further suggests that the entire system is scaled in a coordinated manner to optimize function, but it does not directly affect the trade-off that determines the optimal g-ratio.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.667}$$", "id": "2732722"}]}
