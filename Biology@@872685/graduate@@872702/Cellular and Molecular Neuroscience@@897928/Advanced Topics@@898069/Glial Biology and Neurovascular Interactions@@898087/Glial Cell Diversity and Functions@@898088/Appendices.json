It is a standard exercise in biophysical modeling that requires the application of first principles from electromagnetism and circuit theory. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is derived in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of membrane capacitance per unit length $c_{m}(n)$.\nThe thin-shell approximation ($t \\ll a$) allows us to model a cylindrical capacitor as a parallel-plate capacitor. The area of this capacitor, for a unit length ($L=1$) of the axon, is the surface area of the inner cylinder, $A_{L=1} = 2 \\pi a \\times 1 = 2 \\pi a$.\n\nA single myelin lamella of thickness $d$ and dielectric constant $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}$ can be treated as a single parallel-plate capacitor. Its capacitance per unit area, or specific capacitance, is given by:\n$$C_{\\text{s,single}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{d} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}}{d}$$\nThe capacitance of a single lamella per unit length of the axon, $c_{\\text{single}}$, is the specific capacitance multiplied by the area per unit length:\n$$c_{\\text{single}} = C_{\\text{s,single}} \\cdot (2 \\pi a) = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}}{d}$$\nThe problem states that the $n$ myelin lamellae are arranged in series. For $n$ identical capacitors $C_1$ connected in series, the total equivalent capacitance $C_{\\text{total}}$ is given by the relation:\n$$\\frac{1}{C_{\\text{total}}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{C_i} = \\frac{n}{C_1}$$\nThus, $C_{\\text{total}} = C_1 / n$.\nApplying this to the capacitance per unit length, the total membrane capacitance per unit length for $n$ lamellae, $c_{m}(n)$, is:\n$$c_{m}(n) = \\frac{c_{\\text{single}}}{n} = \\frac{1}{n} \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi a \\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}}{d} \\right)$$\n$$c_{m}(n) = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}}{nd}$$\nThis is the first required expression.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the ratio $\\gamma_{2n}(\\omega)/\\gamma_{n}(\\omega)$.\nThe complex propagation constant $\\gamma(\\omega)$ for a passive transmission line is given by $\\gamma = \\sqrt{ZY}$, where $Z$ is the series impedance per unit length and $Y$ is the shunt admittance per unit length.\n\nFor the axon model:\n- The series impedance per unit length is purely resistive due to the axoplasm, as inductance is stated to be lossless (zero). So, $Z = r_{\\mathrm{ax}}$. Note that $r_{\\mathrm{ax}} = \\rho_i / (\\pi a^2)$, but we only need the symbol $r_{\\mathrm{ax}}$.\n- The shunt admittance per unit length, $Y_m$, corresponds to the membrane. It is modeled as a conductor (representing leak channels) in parallel with a capacitor (representing the dielectric lipid bilayer). The admittance of a parallel resistor-capacitor circuit is $Y = G + i\\omega C$.\n\nThe membrane conductance per unit length, $g_m(n)$, is derived from the specific conductance. The specific conductance of a single bilayer is $g_s$. For $n$ resistive layers in series, the resistances add, so the total specific resistance is $n \\cdot (1/g_s)$. The effective specific conductance is the reciprocal: $g_{s,\\text{eff}} = 1/(n/g_s) = g_s/n$. The total conductance per unit length is then:\n$$g_{m}(n) = g_{s,\\text{eff}} \\cdot (2 \\pi a) = \\frac{2 \\pi a g_s}{n}$$\nUsing the result from Part 1 for $c_m(n)$, the shunt admittance per unit length is:\n$$Y_m(n, \\omega) = g_{m}(n) + i\\omega c_{m}(n) = \\frac{2 \\pi a g_s}{n} + i\\omega \\frac{2 \\pi a \\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}}{nd}$$\nNow, we write the propagation constant as a function of $n$:\n$$\\gamma_{n}(\\omega) = \\sqrt{r_{\\mathrm{ax}} Y_m(n, \\omega)} = \\sqrt{r_{\\mathrm{ax}} \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi a g_s}{n} + i\\omega \\frac{2 \\pi a \\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}}{nd} \\right)}$$\nWe can factor out the dependence on $n$:\n$$\\gamma_{n}(\\omega) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\left[ r_{\\mathrm{ax}} \\left( 2 \\pi a g_s + i\\omega \\frac{2 \\pi a \\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}}{d} \\right) \\right]}$$\nLet the term in the square brackets, which is independent of $n$, be denoted by $K(\\omega)$:\n$$K(\\omega) = r_{\\mathrm{ax}} \\left( 2 \\pi a g_s + i\\omega \\frac{2 \\pi a \\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}}{d} \\right)$$\nThen, the propagation constant has the form:\n$$\\gamma_{n}(\\omega) = \\sqrt{\\frac{K(\\omega)}{n}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{K(\\omega)}}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\nThe problem asks for the ratio $\\gamma_{2n}(\\omega)/\\gamma_{n}(\\omega)$. We can write the expression for $\\gamma_{2n}(\\omega)$ by replacing $n$ with $2n$:\n$$\\gamma_{2n}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\sqrt{K(\\omega)}}{\\sqrt{2n}}$$\nThe ratio is then:\n$$\\frac{\\gamma_{2n}(\\omega)}{\\gamma_{n}(\\omega)} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{K(\\omega)}}{\\sqrt{2n}}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{K(\\omega)}}{\\sqrt{n}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{\\sqrt{2n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}$$\nRationalizing the denominator gives the final simplified form:\n$$\\frac{\\gamma_{2n}(\\omega)}{\\gamma_{n}(\\omega)} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$$\nThis expression is independent of $\\omega$, as required. This completes the second part of the derivation.\n\nThe final answer consists of the two derived quantities: $c_m(n)$ and the ratio $\\gamma_{2n}(\\omega)/\\gamma_{n}(\\omega)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{2 \\pi a \\varepsilon_{0} \\varepsilon_{r}}{nd} & \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2713513"}, {"introduction": "Saltatory conduction arises from the interplay between insulated internodes and excitable nodes of Ranvier.

At steady state, the rate of GABA production (spillover source, $R_s$) is equal to the total rate of removal by uptake transporters.\nThe total uptake rate is the sum of the rates of GAT1 ($v_1$) and GAT3 ($v_3$), each described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics.\nThe governing equation is:\n$$ R_s = v_1 + v_3 = \\frac{V_{\\max,1}\\,[G]_{\\text{base}}}{K_{m,1} + [G]_{\\text{base}}} + \\frac{V_{\\max,3}\\,[G]_{\\text{base}}}{K_{m,3} + [G]_{\\text{base}}} $$\nWe are given the following parameters: $R_s = 0.3\\,\\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, $V_{\\max,1} = 1.5\\,\\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, $K_{m,1} = 12\\,\\mu\\text{M}$, $V_{\\max,3} = 2.0\\,\\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, and $K_{m,3} = 3.0\\,\\mu\\text{M}$. Substituting these values into the equation (letting $x = [G]_{\\text{base}}$ for simplicity):\n$$ 0.3 = \\frac{1.5\\,x}{12 + x} + \\frac{2.0\\,x}{3.0 + x} $$\nTo solve for $x$, we clear the denominators by multiplying by $(12 + x)(3.0 + x)$:\n$$ 0.3(12 + x)(3.0 + x) = 1.5\\,x(3.0 + x) + 2.0\\,x(12 + x) $$\n$$ 0.3(36 + 15x + x^2) = 4.5\\,x + 1.5\\,x^2 + 24x + 2.0\\,x^2 $$\n$$ 10.8 + 4.5\\,x + 0.3\\,x^2 = 28.5\\,x + 3.5\\,x^2 $$\nRearranging the terms yields a standard quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:\n$$ (3.5 - 0.3)x^2 + (28.5 - 4.5)x - 10.8 = 0 $$\n$$ 3.2\\,x^2 + 24x - 10.8 = 0 $$\nWe solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$ x = \\frac{-24 \\pm \\sqrt{(24)^2 - 4(3.2)(-10.8)}}{2(3.2)} $$\n$$ x = \\frac{-24 \\pm \\sqrt{576 + 138.24}}{6.4} $$\n$$ x = \\frac{-24 \\pm \\sqrt{714.24}}{6.4} $$\nSince concentration must be a positive physical quantity, we take the positive root:\n$$ [G]_{\\text{base}} = x = \\frac{-24 + \\sqrt{714.24}}{6.4} \\approx 0.425823\\,\\mu\\text{M} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the steady-state GABA concentration after GAT3 deletion, denoted $[G]_{\\text{del}}$. In this case, the uptake term for GAT3 is zero ($V_{\\max,3} = 0$), so the steady-state condition simplifies to:\n$$ R_s = v_1 = \\frac{V_{\\max,1}\\,[G]_{\\text{del}}}{K_{m,1} + [G]_{\\text{del}}} $$\nSubstituting the known values (letting $y = [G]_{\\text{del}}$):\n$$ 0.3 = \\frac{1.5\\,y}{12 + y} $$\nSolving for $y$:\n$$ 0.3(12 + y) = 1.5\\,y $$\n$$ 3.6 + 0.3\\,y = 1.5\\,y $$\n$$ 3.6 = 1.2\\,y $$\n$$ y = \\frac{3.6}{1.2} = 3.0 $$\nThus, the concentration after deletion is $[G]_{\\text{del}} = 3.0\\,\\mu\\text{M}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the fold-change in the tonic current. The problem states that the tonic current is proportional to the open probability of the extrasynaptic $\\text{GABA}_\\text{A}$ receptors, $P_{\\text{open}}([G])$. The fold-change is the ratio of the current after deletion to the baseline current:\n$$ \\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{\\text{Current}_{\\text{del}}}{\\text{Current}_{\\text{base}}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{open}}([G]_{\\text{del}})}{P_{\\text{open}}([G]_{\\text{base}})} $$\nThe open probability is given by $P_{\\text{open}}([G]) = \\frac{[G]}{EC_{50} + [G]}$, with $EC_{50} = 2.0\\,\\mu\\text{M}$.\nSubstituting this form into the fold-change expression:\n$$ \\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{\\frac{[G]_{\\text{del}}}{EC_{50} + [G]_{\\text{del}}}}{\\frac{[G]_{\\text{base}}}{EC_{50} + [G]_{\\text{base}}}} = \\frac{[G]_{\\text{del}}}{[G]_{\\text{base}}} \\times \\frac{EC_{50} + [G]_{\\text{base}}}{EC_{50} + [G]_{\\text{del}}} $$\nNow, we substitute the calculated concentrations and the given $EC_{50}$:\n$$ [G]_{\\text{base}} \\approx 0.425823\\,\\mu\\text{M} $$\n$$ [G]_{\\text{del}} = 3.0\\,\\mu\\text{M} $$\n$$ EC_{50} = 2.0\\,\\mu\\text{M} $$\n$$ \\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{3.0}{0.425823} \\times \\frac{2.0 + 0.425823}{2.0 + 3.0} $$\n$$ \\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{3.0}{0.425823} \\times \\frac{2.425823}{5.0} $$\n$$ \\text{Fold-change} \\approx 7.04523 \\times 0.4851646 \\approx 3.4181 $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\text{Fold-change} \\approx 3.42 $$\nThis result indicates that deleting the astrocytic GAT3 transporter leads to a substantial, approximately $3.42$-fold increase in the tonic inhibitory current experienced by CA1 pyramidal neurons, highlighting the critical role of astrocytes in regulating neuronal excitability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.42}$$", "id": "2713462"}]}
