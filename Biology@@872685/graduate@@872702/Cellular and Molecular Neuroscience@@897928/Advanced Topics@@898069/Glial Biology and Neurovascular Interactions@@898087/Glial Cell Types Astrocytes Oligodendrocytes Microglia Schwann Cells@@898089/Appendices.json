It is a standard exercise in mathematical biology, is well-posed, and scientifically sound. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we must construct the system of coupled ordinary differential equations for the densities $P(t)$ and $M(t)$ based on the birth-death modeling principle.\n\nFor the OPC population, $P(t)$, the rate of change $\\frac{dP}{dt}$ is the sum of rates of all processes that add or remove OPCs.\n- **Source (Proliferation)**: The per-capita proliferation rate is $r(A)$, but this is limited by total cell density $N = P+M$. The limiting factor is $g(N) = 1 - \\frac{P+M}{K}$. Thus, the total rate of OPC proliferation is $r(A) P \\left(1 - \\frac{P+M}{K}\\right)$.\n- **Sink (Differentiation)**: OPCs differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes at a per-capita rate of $k(T)$. This removes cells from the $P$ pool at a total rate of $k(T) P$.\n- **Sink (Death)**: OPCs die at a constant per-capita rate of $\\delta_{p}$. This removes cells from the $P$ pool at a total rate of $\\delta_{p} P$.\n\nCombining these terms gives the first differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = r(A) P \\left(1 - \\frac{P+M}{K}\\right) - k(T) P - \\delta_{p} P $$\n\nFor the mature oligodendrocyte population, $M(t)$, the rate of change $\\frac{dM}{dt}$ is the sum of rates of processes that add or remove mature cells.\n- **Source (Differentiation)**: Mature cells are created from the differentiation of OPCs. This process adds cells to the $M$ pool at a rate of $k(T) P$.\n- **Sink (Death)**: Mature cells die at a constant per-capita rate of $\\delta_{m}$. This removes cells from the $M$ pool at a total rate of $\\delta_{m} M$.\n\nCombining these terms gives the second differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dM}{dt} = k(T) P - \\delta_{m} M $$\nThis completes the first task.\n\nNext, we solve for the nontrivial steady state, where $\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dM}{dt} = 0$. Let the steady-state densities be $P^{\\ast}$ and $M^{\\ast}$.\nThe system of equations becomes:\n$$ 0 = r(A) P^{\\ast} \\left(1 - \\frac{P^{\\ast}+M^{\\ast}}{K}\\right) - k(T) P^{\\ast} - \\delta_{p} P^{\\ast} \\quad (1) $$\n$$ 0 = k(T) P^{\\ast} - \\delta_{m} M^{\\ast} \\quad (2) $$\n\nThe problem specifies a nontrivial steady state, which means $P^{\\ast} > 0$ and $M^{\\ast} > 0$. From equation $(2)$, we can express $P^{\\ast}$ in terms of $M^{\\ast}$:\n$$ P^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\delta_{m}}{k(T)} M^{\\ast} $$\nSince we assume $P^{\\ast} \\neq 0$, we can divide equation $(1)$ by $P^{\\ast}$:\n$$ 0 = r(A) \\left(1 - \\frac{P^{\\ast}+M^{\\ast}}{K}\\right) - k(T) - \\delta_{p} $$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the total cell density at steady state, $P^{\\ast} + M^{\\ast}$:\n$$ r(A) \\left(1 - \\frac{P^{\\ast}+M^{\\ast}}{K}\\right) = k(T) + \\delta_{p} $$\n$$ 1 - \\frac{P^{\\ast}+M^{\\ast}}{K} = \\frac{k(T) + \\delta_{p}}{r(A)} $$\n$$ \\frac{P^{\\ast}+M^{\\ast}}{K} = 1 - \\frac{k(T) + \\delta_{p}}{r(A)} $$\n$$ P^{\\ast}+M^{\\ast} = K \\left(1 - \\frac{k(T) + \\delta_{p}}{r(A)}\\right) $$\nFor a nontrivial positive solution to exist, it is required that $r(A) > k(T) + \\delta_{p}$. We will verify this condition later with the numerical values.\n\nNow, substitute the expression for $P^{\\ast}$ from equation $(2)$ into the equation for the total density:\n$$ \\frac{\\delta_{m}}{k(T)} M^{\\ast} + M^{\\ast} = K \\left(1 - \\frac{k(T) + \\delta_{p}}{r(A)}\\right) $$\nFactor out $M^{\\ast}$ on the left side:\n$$ M^{\\ast} \\left(\\frac{\\delta_{m}}{k(T)} + 1\\right) = K \\left(1 - \\frac{k(T) + \\delta_{p}}{r(A)}\\right) $$\n$$ M^{\\ast} \\left(\\frac{\\delta_{m} + k(T)}{k(T)}\\right) = K \\left(1 - \\frac{k(T) + \\delta_{p}}{r(A)}\\right) $$\nFinally, isolate $M^{\\ast}$ to obtain the closed-form expression:\n$$ M^{\\ast} = K \\frac{k(T)}{k(T) + \\delta_{m}} \\left(1 - \\frac{k(T) + \\delta_{p}}{r(A)}\\right) $$\nThis completes the second task.\n\nFinally, we must evaluate $M^{\\ast}$ numerically.

Assume that glutamate uptake by each transporter class follows quasi-steady-state Michaelis–Menten kinetics with the same Michaelis constant $K_m$ and that the two transporter populations act independently on the same substrate pool so their uptake rates add.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of chemical kinetics (Michaelis–Menten), is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is formulated objectively. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution: first, the formulation of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the extracellular glutamate concentration $C(t)$, and second, the calculation of the time $t^*$ required for this concentration to fall from an initial value $C_0$ to a threshold value $C_{\\mathrm{thr}}$.\n\nLet $n(t)$ be the number of moles of glutamate in the effective extracellular volume $V_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ at time $t$. This is related to the molar concentration $C(t)$ by the equation:\n$$ n(t) = C(t) V_{\\mathrm{ex}} $$\nThe principle of mass conservation dictates that the rate of change of the number of moles of glutamate in the volume is equal to the negative of the total rate of uptake by the astrocytic transporters. Let the total uptake rate in moles per unit time be $J_{\\text{total}}(t)$.\n$$ \\frac{dn}{dt} = -J_{\\text{total}}(t) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $n(t)$ and assuming $V_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ is constant, we have:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\frac{dC}{dt} = -J_{\\text{total}}(t) $$\nThe problem states that two types of transporters, GLT-1 and GLAST, contribute to the uptake. Their rates are additive and each follows Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The total uptake rate is therefore the sum of the individual rates, $J_1(t)$ for GLT-1 and $J_2(t)$ for GLAST:\n$$ J_{\\text{total}}(t) = J_1(t) + J_2(t) $$\nThe Michaelis–Menten equation for the rate of reaction for transporter type $i$ is:\n$$ J_i(t) = V_{\\max,i} \\frac{C(t)}{K_m + C(t)} $$\nwhere $V_{\\max,i}$ is the maximum uptake rate in moles per unit time for transporter type $i$, and $K_m$ is the common Michaelis constant. The total uptake rate is thus:\n$$ J_{\\text{total}}(t) = (V_{\\max,1} + V_{\\max,2}) \\frac{C(t)}{K_m + C(t)} $$\nThe maximum uptake rate, $V_{\\max,i}$, is determined by the total number of transporter molecules of type $i$, which we denote $N_i$, and their catalytic turnover rate, $k_{\\mathrm{cat},i}$. The rate is typically given in molecules per second, so we must divide by Avogadro's number, $N_A$, to obtain the rate in moles per second.\n$$ V_{\\max,i} = \\frac{N_i \\cdot k_{\\mathrm{cat},i}}{N_A} $$\nThe number of transporters, $N_i$, is the product of the surface density, $\\rho_i$, and the effective membrane area, $A_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n$$ N_i = \\rho_i A_{\\mathrm{eff}} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $V_{\\max,i}$:\n$$ V_{\\max,i} = \\frac{\\rho_i A_{\\mathrm{eff}} k_{\\mathrm{cat},i}}{N_A} $$\nThe total maximum uptake rate, $V_{\\max, \\text{total}} = V_{\\max,1} + V_{\\max,2}$, is then:\n$$ V_{\\max, \\text{total}} = \\frac{(\\rho_1 k_{\\mathrm{cat},1} + \\rho_2 k_{\\mathrm{cat},2}) A_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{N_A} $$\nWe now substitute this back into the mass balance equation:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\frac{dC}{dt} = -\\left( \\frac{(\\rho_1 k_{\\mathrm{cat},1} + \\rho_2 k_{\\mathrm{cat},2}) A_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{N_A} \\right) \\frac{C(t)}{K_m + C(t)} $$\nTo formulate the ODE for $C(t)$ as requested, we divide by $V_{\\mathrm{ex}}$:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = - \\left( \\frac{(\\rho_1 k_{\\mathrm{cat},1} + \\rho_2 k_{\\mathrm{cat},2}) A_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{N_A V_{\\mathrm{ex}}} \\right) \\frac{C(t)}{K_m + C(t)} $$\nThis is the ordinary differential equation for the extracellular glutamate concentration $C(t)$, which completes the first task. For brevity in the subsequent steps, let us define the maximal rate of concentration change, $\\mathcal{V}_{\\max}$, as:\n$$ \\mathcal{V}_{\\max} \\equiv \\frac{(\\rho_1 k_{\\mathrm{cat},1} + \\rho_2 k_{\\mathrm{cat},2}) A_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{N_A V_{\\mathrm{ex}}} $$\nThe ODE is then written compactly as:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = -\\mathcal{V}_{\\max} \\frac{C}{K_m + C} $$\n\nFor the second task, we must solve this ODE to find the time $t^*$ at which $C(t^*)=C_{\\mathrm{thr}}$, given the initial condition $C(0)=C_0$. The equation is separable. We rearrange the terms to separate the variables $C$ and $t$:\n$$ \\frac{K_m + C}{C} dC = -\\mathcal{V}_{\\max} dt $$\n$$ \\left( \\frac{K_m}{C} + 1 \\right) dC = -\\mathcal{V}_{\\max} dt $$\nWe integrate both sides of the equation. The concentration $C$ changes from $C_0$ to $C_{\\mathrm{thr}}$ as time $t$ changes from $0$ to $t^*$:\n$$ \\int_{C_0}^{C_{\\mathrm{thr}}} \\left( \\frac{K_m}{C} + 1 \\right) dC = \\int_0^{t^*} -\\mathcal{V}_{\\max} dt $$\n$$ \\left[ K_m \\ln C + C \\right]_{C_0}^{C_{\\mathrm{thr}}} = -\\mathcal{V}_{\\max} [t]_0^{t^*} $$\n$$ (K_m \\ln C_{\\mathrm{thr}} + C_{\\mathrm{thr}}) - (K_m \\ln C_0 + C_0) = -\\mathcal{V}_{\\max} t^* $$\n$$ K_m (\\ln C_{\\mathrm{thr}} - \\ln C_0) + (C_{\\mathrm{thr}} - C_0) = -\\mathcal{V}_{\\max} t^* $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\ln C_{\\mathrm{thr}} - \\ln C_0 = \\ln (C_{\\mathrm{thr}}/C_0)$.
