Consider an X-linked escape gene for which, in a cell with one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (XY; typically male karyotype), the single active X allele contributes a baseline mean expression level denoted by $E$, with $E>0$. In XX cells, assume that one X is active and contributes the same baseline $E$, while the allele on the inactive X contributes a fraction $f$ of the active allele’s expression, with $f \\in [0,1]$.

I will first validate the problem statement.\n\nThe givens are:\n1.  In XY cells, a single active X-allele contributes a baseline mean expression level denoted by $E$, where $E > 0$.\n2.  In XX cells, one X chromosome is active and contributes the same baseline expression level $E$.\n3.  The allele on the inactive X chromosome in XX cells is an escape gene, contributing a fraction $f$ of the active allele's expression, where $f \\in [0, 1]$.\n4.  The contributions of alleles to the total mean expression are linearly additive.\n5.  Per-allele activity is identical across karyotypes (i.e., the active X in an XX cell behaves like the active X in an XY cell).\n6.  There is no compensatory feedback mechanism.\n7.  There is no contribution from a Y-linked homologous gene.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the established biological principles of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) and escape genes. The simplifying assumptions, such as linear additivity and the absence of feedback, are standard for creating a first-order mathematical model of a biological system. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and relations to derive a unique solution. It is stated objectively and contains no internal contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution may be derived.\n\nLet $E_{XY}$ be the total mean expression of the gene in an XY cell. According to the problem statement, the single active X chromosome contributes an expression level of $E$. There is no other source of expression. Therefore,\n$$E_{XY} = E$$\n\nLet $E_{XX}$ be the total mean expression of the same gene in an XX cell. Such a cell contains one active X chromosome and one inactive X chromosome. The contribution from the active X chromosome is given as $E$. The contribution from the escape allele on the inactive X chromosome is given as a fraction $f$ of the active allele's expression, which is $f \\cdot E$. The problem states that the contributions are linearly additive. Thus, the total expression in an XX cell is the sum of the contributions from the active and the inactive X chromosomes:\n$$E_{XX} = E + f \\cdot E$$\n\nThe fold-change in mean expression of this gene in XX cells relative to XY cells is the ratio of the total expression in XX cells to the total expression in XY cells. Let this fold-change be denoted by $FC_{XX/XY}$.\n$$FC_{XX/XY} = \\frac{E_{XX}}{E_{XY}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $E_{XX}$ and $E_{XY}$ into this ratio gives:\n$$FC_{XX/XY} = \\frac{E + f \\cdot E}{E}$$\n\nWe can factor out $E$ from the numerator:\n$$FC_{XX/XY} = \\frac{E(1 + f)}{E}$$\n\nSince the problem states that $E > 0$, we can safely cancel the term $E$ from the numerator and the denominator. This simplification yields the final closed-form expression for the fold-change in terms of the escape fraction $f$:\n$$FC_{XX/XY} = 1 + f$$\n\nThis result is the required simplified closed-form expression for the expected fold-change. For a gene that does not escape XCI, $f=0$, and the fold-change is $1$, indicating perfect dosage compensation. For a gene that completely escapes XCI, $f=1$, and the fold-change is $2$, indicating that the XX cell has double the expression of an XY cell, consistent with the presence of two fully active alleles.

The problem asks for the difference in population variances of the average per-cell expression for the X-linked gene ($V_X$) and the autosomal gene ($V_A$).\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, modeling the well-established biological process of X-chromosome inactivation and its quantitative consequences. It is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and assumptions for a unique solution clearly defined. The language is objective and formal. The model is a valid simplification used in quantitative genetics and does not contain scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed to the solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the population variance of the average per-cell expression for the X-linked gene, $V_X$.\nLet $X_i$ be the random variable representing the expression of the X-linked gene in a single neuron $i$, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. According to the problem statement, $X_i$ can take one of two values:\n$$\nX_i = \\begin{cases} b + \\delta & \\text{with probability } s \\\\ b - \\delta & \\text{with probability } 1-s \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe randomness in $X_i$ arises from the stochastic choice of which X-chromosome is active. The choices are independent across neurons. Therefore, the random variables $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).\n\nTo find the variance of $X_i$, we can model it as a linear transformation of a Bernoulli random variable. Let $Z_i$ be a Bernoulli random variable such that $Z_i = 1$ if the maternal X is active (with probability $s$) and $Z_i = 0$ if the paternal X is active (with probability $1-s$). The expression $X_i$ can then be written as:\n$$\nX_i = (b + \\delta)Z_i + (b - \\delta)(1 - Z_i) = bZ_i + \\delta Z_i + b - \\delta - bZ_i + \\delta Z_i = (b - \\delta) + 2\\delta Z_i\n$$\nThe variance of a random variable $Y$ transformed as $aY+c$ is $a^2 Var(Y)$. Here, the constant is $b-\\delta$ and the scaling factor is $2\\delta$. The variance of the Bernoulli random variable $Z_i$ is $Var(Z_i) = s(1-s)$.\nTherefore, the variance of the expression in a single neuron is:\n$$\nVar(X_i) = Var((b - \\delta) + 2\\delta Z_i) = (2\\delta)^2 Var(Z_i) = 4\\delta^2 s(1-s)\n$$\nThe tissue-level readout for an individual is the average per-cell expression across the $n$ sampled neurons, which we denote as $\\bar{X}$:\n$$\n\\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\n$$\nThe \"population variance\" of this average, $V_X$, refers to the variance of the random variable $\\bar{X}$. Since the $X_i$ are i.i.d., the variance of their average is the variance of a single observation divided by the sample size $n$:\n$$\nV_X = Var(\\bar{X}) = Var\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right) = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Var(X_i) = \\frac{1}{n^2} (n \\cdot Var(X_1)) = \\frac{Var(X_1)}{n}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $Var(X_i)$:\n$$\nV_X = \\frac{4\\delta^2 s(1-s)}{n}\n$$\nThis variance arises because even though all individuals are genetically identical, the stochastic nature of XCI leads to different compositions of maternally and paternally-derived X-expressing cells in the sampled tissue of each individual, making $\\bar{X}$ a random variable with non-zero variance.\n\nNext, we derive the variance for the autosomal control gene, $V_A$.\nFor the autosomal gene, both alleles are expressed in each neuron. The per-cell expression output, which we denote $A_i$, is given as:\n$$\nA_i = (b + \\delta) + (b - \\delta) = 2b\n$$\nThe problem explicitly states to ignore any other sources of variability. Thus, the expression in each neuron, $A_i$, is not a random variable but a constant, $2b$.\nThe average per-cell expression across $n$ neurons, $\\bar{A}$, is:\n$$\n\\bar{A} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (2b) = \\frac{n \\cdot 2b}{n} = 2b\n$$\nThe average expression $\\bar{A}$ is also a constant. The variance of any constant is zero. Therefore, within the population of genetically identical individuals, the average tissue expression for this autosomal gene is identical for every individual.\nThe population variance, $V_A$, is thus:\n$$\nV_A = Var(\\bar{A}) = Var(2b) = 0\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the difference between these variances, $V_X - V_A$.\n$$\nV_X - V_A = \\frac{4\\delta^2 s(1-s)}{n} - 0 = \\frac{4\\delta^2 s(1-s)}{n}\n$$\nThis result quantifies the additional inter-individual variance in tissue-level expression that arises specifically from the stochastic mosaicism of X-chromosome inactivation for an X-linked gene with a non-zero cis-acting allelic effect $\\delta$, compared to a similarly regulated autosomal gene. This variance is maximized when XCI is random ($s=0.5$) and disappears when XCI is fully skewed ($s=0$ or $s=1$), as well as when there is no allelic expression difference ($\\delta=0$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{4\\delta^2s(1-s)}{n}}\n$$", "id": "2751183"}, {"introduction": "Ultimately, differences in gene expression between sexes must translate into functional changes at the cellular and circuit levels to influence behavior and physiology.

It is based on the established quantal theory of synaptic transmission, a cornerstone of cellular neuroscience. The biological context, concerning sexually dimorphic regulation of AMPARs in the hippocampus, is a valid topic of contemporary research. The problem provides a clear, self-contained set of conditions and assumptions, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. The terminology is precise and standard within the field. The assumptions, such as the linear scaling of current with receptor number, represent a common and tractable simplification (the non-saturating case), and the problem correctly asks for consideration of the alternative (the saturating case), demonstrating its own conceptual rigor. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or scientifically unsound premises.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A formal solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\nThe foundation of this analysis is the quantal theory of synaptic transmission, which describes the evoked postsynaptic current as the product of the number of released vesicles (quantal content) and the response to a single vesicle (quantal size).\n\nLet $I_{\\text{evoked}}$ represent the mean amplitude of the evoked EPSC. Let $m$ represent the mean quantal content, and let $q$ represent the mean quantal size. The relationship is given by:\n$$I_{\\text{evoked}} = m \\cdot q$$\n\nThe mean quantal content, $m$, is the average number of vesicles released per presynaptic action potential. It is determined by the number of available release sites, $n$, and the probability of release at each site, $p$. For a simple binomial model, $m = n \\cdot p$.\n\nWe are asked to find the fold-change in the mean evoked EPSC from males (M) to females (F), which is the ratio $I_{\\text{evoked, F}} / I_{\\text{evoked, M}}$. Using the fundamental equation, this ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\text{evoked, F}}}{I_{\\text{evoked, M}}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{F}} \\cdot q_{\\text{F}}}{m_{\\text{M}} \\cdot q_{\\text{M}}} $$\n\nThe problem states that the presynaptic release machinery is unchanged between sexes. Specifically, the number of release sites ($n$) and the release probability ($p$) are constant. Therefore, the mean quantal content is the same for both groups:\n$$ n_{\\text{F}} = n_{\\text{M}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p_{\\text{F}} = p_{\\text{M}} \\implies m_{\\text{F}} = m_{\\text{M}} $$\n\nSubstituting this into the ratio simplifies the expression to one that depends only on the quantal sizes:\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\text{evoked, F}}}{I_{\\text{evoked, M}}} = \\frac{q_{\\text{F}}}{q_{\\text{M}}} $$\nThis shows that the fold-change in the evoked current is entirely determined by the fold-change in the quantal size.\n\nThe problem specifies the primary model to be used: AMPARs operate without significant saturation, and the quantal current scales linearly with the available AMPAR number. Let $N_{\\text{AMPAR}}$ be the number of functional AMPARs at the postsynaptic density. The linear scaling implies a direct proportionality:\n$$ q \\propto N_{\\text{AMPAR}} $$\nWe can write this as $q = k \\cdot N_{\\text{AMPAR}}$, where $k$ is a proportionality constant. This constant $k$ encapsulates factors such as the glutamate concentration profile from a single vesicle, single-channel conductance, ion gradients, and receptor kinetics. The problem states that these properties are identical between sexes, which means the constant $k$ is the same for males and females.\n\nNow we can express the ratio of quantal sizes in terms of the number of AMPARs:\n$$ \\frac{q_{\\text{F}}}{q_{\\text{M}}} = \\frac{k \\cdot N_{\\text{AMPAR, F}}}{k \\cdot N_{\\text{AMPAR, M}}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{AMPAR, F}}}{N_{\\text{AMPAR, M}}} $$\n\nThe problem provides the crucial piece of information regarding the number of AMPARs: the number in females is increased by $25\\%$ relative to males. This can be written as:\n$$ N_{\\text{AMPAR, F}} = N_{\\text{AMPAR, M}} + 0.25 \\cdot N_{\\text{AMPAR, M}} = 1.25 \\cdot N_{\\text{AMPAR, M}} $$\n\nFrom this, the ratio of AMPAR numbers is:\n$$ \\frac{N_{\\text{AMPAR, F}}}{N_{\\text{AMPAR, M}}} = 1.25 $$\n\nCombining our results, we find the predicted fold-change in the evoked EPSC:\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\text{evoked, F}}}{I_{\\text{evoked, M}}} = \\frac{q_{\\text{F}}}{q_{\\text{M}}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{AMPAR, F}}}{N_{\\text{AMPAR, M}}} = 1.25 $$\nThus, under the non-saturating assumption, the mean evoked EPSC is predicted to be $25\\%$ larger in females than in males.\n\n**Verification Step: The Alternative Assumption**\nAs requested, we now evaluate the alternative scenario where the quantal size remains constant despite the increase in AMPAR number ($q_{\\text{F}} = q_{\\text{M}}$).\nIn this case, the ratio of evoked currents would be:\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\text{evoked, F}}}{I_{\\text{evoked, M}}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{F}} \\cdot q_{\\text{F}}}{m_{\\text{M}} \\cdot q_{\\text{M}}} $$\nSince $m_{\\text{F}} = m_{\\text{M}}$ and we are now assuming $q_{\\text{F}} = q_{\\text{M}}$, the ratio becomes:\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\text{evoked, F}}}{I_{\\text{evoked, M}}} = 1 $$\nThis alternative assumption predicts no change in the mean evoked EPSC amplitude. The physical basis for this assumption would be **receptor saturation**. If the concentration of glutamate released from a single vesicle is high enough to saturate all available AMPARs in the male synapse, then adding more receptors (as in the female synapse) would not lead to a larger current for a single quantal event. The quantal size would be limited by the amount of neurotransmitter in a vesicle, not by the number of postsynaptic receptors. This scenario directly contradicts the primary model of a non-saturating, linear regime. The primary model is therefore required for the calculated change.\n\nThe final answer is derived from the primary, non-saturating model.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1.25} $$", "id": "2751174"}]}
