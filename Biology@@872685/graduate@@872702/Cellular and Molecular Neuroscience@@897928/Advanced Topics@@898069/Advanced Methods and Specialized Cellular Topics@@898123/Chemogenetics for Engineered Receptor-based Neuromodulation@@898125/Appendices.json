By reasoning from first principles, you will predict how activating hM3Dq or hM4Di receptors alters key measures of intrinsic excitability, building a foundational understanding of how these tools achieve neuromodulation.", "problem": "In acute brain slices from adult mouse neocortex, two transgenic lines express Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) in layer $2/3$ pyramidal neurons: a Gq-coupled human M$3$ muscarinic receptor variant (hM3Dq) and a Gi/o-coupled human M$4$ muscarinic receptor variant (hM4Di). Whole-cell current-clamp recordings are obtained under synaptic blockade. After establishing a stable baseline, deschloroclozapine (DCZ) at $10$ nM is bath-applied to selectively activate the DREADDs. Three standard intrinsic excitability readouts are measured: input resistance, rheobase, and steady-state spike frequency in response to a fixed depolarizing current step.\n\nAssume the following as the fundamental base for your reasoning:\n- Ohm’s law in the membrane approximation: the small-signal voltage deflection obeys $\\Delta V = I \\cdot R_{\\text{in}}$, where $R_{\\text{in}}$ is the input resistance and $I$ the injected current. Total membrane conductance is $G_{\\text{m}} = 1/R_{\\text{in}}$ and is the sum of open ionic conductances.\n- The rheobase is the minimal constant current $I_{\\text{rh}}$ that drives the membrane from rest to spike threshold under near-steady conditions. For small-signal linearization near rest, $I_{\\text{rh}} \\approx \\left(V_{\\text{th}} - V_{\\text{rest}}\\right)/R_{\\text{in}}$, where $V_{\\text{th}}$ is spike threshold and $V_{\\text{rest}}$ is the resting membrane potential.\n- For muscarinic Gq signaling in pyramidal neurons, phospholipase C activation depletes phosphatidylinositol $4,5$-bisphosphate, suppressing KCNQ (M-current) and other resting potassium leak currents, thereby reducing net potassium conductance toward the potassium reversal potential $E_{K}$. For Gi/o signaling, G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels are activated, increasing potassium conductance toward $E_{K}$.\n- The steady-state spike frequency under a fixed depolarizing current step depends on how far and how fast the membrane depolarizes relative to threshold and on the effective gain (the $f$–$I$ relationship): increases in $R_{\\text{in}}$ and depolarizing shifts of $V_{\\text{rest}}$ generally increase spike frequency at a fixed $I$, whereas decreases in $R_{\\text{in}}$ and hyperpolarization decrease it.\n\nTo anchor intuition, consider a representative baseline neuron with $V_{\\text{rest}} \\approx -70$ mV, $V_{\\text{th}} \\approx -50$ mV, and $R_{\\text{in}} \\approx 100$ M$\\Omega$.

The described DREADD receptors, their coupling to G-protein pathways (Gq and Gi/o), and their canonical effects on specific ion channels (KCNQ, GIRK) are factually correct and form a standard model in the field.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear set of initial conditions, defined mechanisms of action, and asks for a qualitative prediction of measurable outcomes. A unique set of directional changes can be logically derived from the premises.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise, technical, and free of subjectivity.\n\nThe problem statement contains no scientific or logical flaws, is complete, internally consistent, and directly solvable using the provided principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe analysis proceeds by considering each DREADD receptor type independently, based on the provided principles.\n\n**Case 1: hM3Dq (Gq-coupled) Activation**\n1.  **Mechanism**: The problem states that Gq signaling via hM3Dq activation suppresses resting potassium currents, including the M-current (KCNQ). This closure of potassium channels leads to a decrease in the total resting potassium conductance, $g_K$.\n2.  **Input Resistance ($R_{\\text{in}}$)**: The total membrane conductance, $G_{\\text{m}}$, is the sum of all individual ionic conductances. Since a major component of the resting conductance, $g_K$, is decreased, the total conductance $G_{\\text{m}}$ must also decrease. Input resistance is the reciprocal of conductance, $R_{\\text{in}} = 1/G_{\\text{m}}$. Therefore, a decrease in $G_{\\text{m}}$ results in an **increase** in $R_{\\text{in}}$.\n3.  **Resting Membrane Potential ($V_{\\text{rest}}$)**: The resting membrane potential is established by the balance of ionic fluxes. The resting neuron is primarily permeable to K$^+$ ions, making $V_{\\text{rest}}$ close to the potassium reversal potential, $E_K$ (e.g., approximately $-90$ mV). Decreasing the potassium conductance $g_K$ reduces the influence of the outward K$^+$ current relative to the constant inward leak currents (e.g., Na$^+$ leak). Consequently, $V_{\\text{rest}}$ will shift to a more positive value, i.e., it will **depolarize**. For instance, it might shift from $-70$ mV to $-65$ mV.\n4.  **Rheobase ($I_{\\text{rh}}$)**: We apply the given approximation $I_{\\text{rh}} \\approx \\left(V_{\\text{th}} - V_{\\text{rest}}\\right)/R_{\\text{in}}$.\n    - The numerator, the voltage difference to threshold $\\left(V_{\\text{th}} - V_{\\text{rest}}\\right)$, decreases because $V_{\\text{rest}}$ depolarizes, moving closer to $V_{\\text{th}}$.\n    - The denominator, $R_{\\text{in}}$, increases as determined above.\n    - A decrease in the numerator and an increase in the denominator both contribute to a smaller value for the fraction. Thus, the rheobase $I_{\\text{rh}}$ will **decrease**. The neuron becomes easier to excite to threshold.\n5.  **Spike Frequency**: The problem states that spike frequency at a fixed current $I_{\\text{inj}}$ is increased by an increase in $R_{\\text{in}}$ and by depolarization of $V_{\\text{rest}}$. Our analysis shows that hM3Dq activation causes both of these effects. The cell is closer to threshold and the same current injection $I_{\\text{inj}} = 150$ pA will produce a larger voltage deflection $\\Delta V = I_{\\text{inj}} \\cdot R_{\\text{in}}$ because $R_{\\text{in}}$ has increased. Therefore, the steady-state spike frequency will **increase**.\n\n**Summary for hM3Dq**: Input resistance increases, rheobase decreases, spike frequency increases.\n\n**Case 2: hM4Di (Gi/o-coupled) Activation**\n1.  **Mechanism**: The problem states that Gi/o signaling via hM4Di activation opens GIRK channels. This directly increases the membrane's potassium conductance, $g_K$.\n2.  **Input Resistance ($R_{\\text{in}}$)**: An increase in $g_K$ causes an increase in the total membrane conductance $G_{\\text{m}}$. Since $R_{\\text{in}} = 1/G_{\\text{m}}$, the input resistance $R_{\\text{in}}$ will **decrease**.\n3.  **Resting Membrane Potential ($V_{\\text{rest}}$)**: Increasing the potassium conductance $g_K$ strengthens the influence of the K$^+$ Nernst potential, $E_K$. This will pull the membrane potential $V_{\\text{rest}}$ closer to $E_K$, which is more negative than the initial $V_{\\text{rest}}$. Therefore, $V_{\\text{rest}}$ will shift to a more negative value, i.e., it will **hyperpolarize**. For instance, it might shift from $-70$ mV to $-75$ mV.\n4.  **Rheobase ($I_{\\text{rh}}$)**: We again use the approximation $I_{\\text{rh}} \\approx \\left(V_{\\text{th}} - V_{\\text{rest}}\\right)/R_{\\text{in}}$.\n    - The numerator, $\\left(V_{\\text{th}} - V_{\\text{rest}}\\right)$, increases because $V_{\\text{rest}}$ hyperpolarizes, moving further from $V_{\\text{th}}$.\n    - The denominator, $R_{\\text{in}}$, decreases as determined above.\n    - An increase in the numerator and a decrease in the denominator both contribute to a larger value for the fraction. Thus, the rheobase $I_{\\text{rh}}$ will **increase**. The neuron becomes harder to excite to threshold.\n5.  **Spike Frequency**: The problem states that spike frequency at a fixed current $I_{\\text{inj}}$ is decreased by a decrease in $R_{\\text{in}}$ and by hyperpolarization of $V_{\\text{rest}}$. Our analysis shows that hM4Di activation causes both of these effects. The cell is further from threshold and the same current injection $I_{\\text{inj}} = 150$ pA will produce a smaller voltage deflection $\\Delta V$ because $R_{\\text{in}}$ has decreased. Therefore, the steady-state spike frequency will **decrease**.\n\n**Summary for hM4Di**: Input resistance decreases, rheobase increases, spike frequency decreases.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n- **A) hM3Dq: input resistance increases, rheobase decreases, spike frequency at $I_{\\text{inj}}$ increases; hM4Di: input resistance decreases, rheobase increases, spike frequency at $I_{\\text{inj}}$ decreases.**\nThis option's predictions for hM3Dq (increase, decrease, increase) and for hM4Di (decrease, increase, decrease) perfectly match the results derived from the first principles provided.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B) hM3Dq: input resistance decreases, rheobase decreases, spike frequency at $I_{\\text{inj}}$ increases; hM4Di: input resistance increases, rheobase increases, spike frequency at $I_{\\text{inj}}$ decreases.**\nThis option incorrectly states that hM3Dq activation decreases input resistance and that hM4Di activation increases input resistance. These are the opposite of the derived effects on membrane conductance.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C) hM3Dq: input resistance increases, rheobase increases, spike frequency at $I_{\\text{inj}}$ decreases; hM4Di: input resistance decreases, rheobase decreases, spike frequency at $I_{\\text{inj}}$ increases.**\nThis option incorrectly describes the effects on rheobase and spike frequency for both receptor types. For hM3Dq, it claims rheobase increases and frequency decreases, which contradicts the excitatory nature of this manipulation. For hM4Di, it claims rheobase decreases and frequency increases, which contradicts the inhibitory nature of this manipulation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D) Both hM3Dq and hM4Di: no significant change in input resistance; both decrease rheobase and increase spike frequency at $I_{\\text{inj}}$ due to G protein modulation that accelerates spike initiation kinetics.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. It claims no significant change in input resistance, which contradicts the primary mechanisms of modulating K$^+$ conductances. It also incorrectly claims both manipulations have the same excitatory effect, ignoring the opposing nature of Gq and Gi/o signaling on neuronal excitability as defined in the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2704807"}, {"introduction": "An ideal chemogenetic system features a designer ligand that interacts exclusively with its designer receptor.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the fractional occupancy of a receptor, followed by calculation of a weighted mean occupancy for three specific receptor types.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for fractional occupancy, denoted as $\\theta$. Consider a simple reversible binding reaction between a receptor $R$ and a ligand $L$ to form a complex $RL$:\n$$ R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL $$\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined by the law of mass action at equilibrium:\n$$ K_D = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]} $$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free, unbound receptors, $[L]$ is the concentration of free ligand, and $[RL]$ is the concentration of the receptor-ligand complex.\n\nFractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are in the ligand-bound state. The total concentration of receptors, $B_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the concentrations of free and bound receptors: $B_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [RL]$.\nThus, the fractional occupancy is:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{B_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]} $$\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_D$, we first rearrange the definition of $K_D$ to solve for $[R]$:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{K_D [RL]}{[L]} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{\\frac{K_D [RL]}{[L]} + [RL]} $$\nAssuming a non-zero concentration of bound receptors, $[RL] \\ne 0$, we can factor $[RL]$ from the denominator and simplify:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL] \\left( \\frac{K_D}{[L]} + 1 \\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_D}{[L]} + 1} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[L]$ yields the standard form, known as the Hill-Langmuir equation:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_D} $$\nThis expression gives the fractional occupancy of a single population of receptors as a function of free ligand concentration and the receptor's dissociation constant for that ligand.\n\nNext, we apply this formula to calculate the fractional occupancy for each of the three endogenous receptor populations, using the given free clozapine concentration $[L] = 10 \\text{ nM}$.\n\nFor the Histamine H1 receptor:\n$$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{H1}} = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_{D,\\mathrm{H1}}} = \\frac{10}{10 + 4} = \\frac{10}{14} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\nFor the Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor:\n$$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{5HT2A}} = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_{D,\\mathrm{5HT2A}}} = \\frac{10}{10 + 10} = \\frac{10}{20} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\nFor the Dopamine D2 receptor:\n$$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{D2}} = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_{D,\\mathrm{D2}}} = \\frac{10}{10 + 150} = \\frac{10}{160} = \\frac{1}{16} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the density-weighted mean endogenous off-target occupancy, $\\bar{\\theta}$.

The formula for the weighted mean is:\n$$ \\bar{\\theta} = \\frac{\\sum_{i} B_{\\max,i} \\cdot \\theta_i}{\\sum_{i} B_{\\max,i}} $$\nThe given relative densities are $B_{\\max,\\mathrm{H1}} = 0.5$, $B_{\\max,\\mathrm{5HT2A}} = 1.0$, and $B_{\\max,\\mathrm{D2}} = 2.0$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the weights (total relative density):\n$$ \\sum_{i} B_{\\max,i} = B_{\\max,\\mathrm{H1}} + B_{\\max,\\mathrm{5HT2A}} + B_{\\max,\\mathrm{D2}} = 0.5 + 1.0 + 2.0 = 3.5 $$\nNext, we calculate the sum of the weighted occupancies:\n$$ \\sum_{i} B_{\\max,i} \\cdot \\theta_i = (B_{\\max,\\mathrm{H1}} \\cdot \\theta_{\\mathrm{H1}}) + (B_{\\max,\\mathrm{5HT2A}} \\cdot \\theta_{\\mathrm{5HT2A}}) + (B_{\\max,\\mathrm{D2}} \\cdot \\theta_{\\mathrm{D2}}) $$\n$$ \\sum_{i} B_{\\max,i} \\cdot \\theta_i = \\left(0.5 \\cdot \\frac{5}{7}\\right) + \\left(1.0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(2.0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{16}\\right) $$\n$$ \\sum_{i} B_{\\max,i} \\cdot \\theta_i = \\frac{2.5}{7} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{16} = \\frac{5}{14} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo sum these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $56$:\n$$ \\sum_{i} B_{\\max,i} \\cdot \\theta_i = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4}{14 \\cdot 4} + \\frac{1 \\cdot 28}{2 \\cdot 28} + \\frac{1 \\cdot 7}{8 \\cdot 7} = \\frac{20}{56} + \\frac{28}{56} + \\frac{7}{56} = \\frac{55}{56} $$\nFinally, we compute the weighted mean occupancy $\\bar{\\theta}$:\n$$ \\bar{\\theta} = \\frac{\\sum_{i} B_{\\max,i} \\cdot \\theta_i}{\\sum_{i} B_{\\max,i}} = \\frac{55/56}{3.5} = \\frac{55/56}{7/2} = \\frac{55}{56} \\cdot \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{55}{28 \\cdot 7} = \\frac{55}{196} $$\nAs a decimal fraction, this is:\n$$ \\bar{\\theta} = \\frac{55}{196} \\approx 0.2806122... $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required gives $0.2806$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.2806}\n$$", "id": "2704772"}]}
