A solution will be provided.\n\nThe first task is to derive an expression for the fractional activation $f([\\text{Ca}^{2+}])$ of the enzyme DAGL-$\\alpha$. The activation is governed by the cooperative binding of $n$ calcium ions to the enzyme's regulatory module. This process can be modeled by the Hill equation.\n\nLet $E$ represent the enzyme and $L$ represent the ligand, which in this case is $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$. The simplified cooperative binding reaction is:\n$$ E + nL \\rightleftharpoons EL_n $$\nwhere $EL_n$ is the active enzyme-ligand complex.\n\nThe fractional activation, $f([L])$, is defined as the fraction of enzyme molecules in the active, ligand-bound state. This is equivalent to the fractional occupancy of the binding sites.\n$$ f([L]) = \\frac{[EL_n]}{[E]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[EL_n]}{[E] + [EL_n]} $$\nFrom the law of mass action, we can define an apparent macroscopic dissociation constant, $K_d$, for the overall binding reaction:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[E][L]^n}{[EL_n]} $$\nRearranging this gives an expression for the concentration of free enzyme, $[E]$:\n$$ [E] = \\frac{K_d [EL_n]}{[L]^n} $$\nSubstituting this into the equation for fractional activation:\n$$ f([L]) = \\frac{[EL_n]}{\\frac{K_d [EL_n]}{[L]^n} + [EL_n]} $$\nThe term $[EL_n]$ cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ f([L]) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]^n} + 1} = \\frac{[L]^n}{K_d + [L]^n} $$\nThe \"sensitivity constant\" $K_{\\text{Ca}}$ is defined as the ligand concentration that produces half-maximal activation, so $f([L]) = 0.5$ when $[L] = K_{\\text{Ca}}$.

The task is to perform a specified calculation based on a given model.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. The assumptions are explicitly stated and are not contradictory. The model of depletion is clearly specified.\n5.  **Relevance:** The problem is directly relevant to the topic of retrograde signaling by endocannabinoids, as it models the quantitative consequences of their known action—the reduction of presynaptic release probability.\n\nThe problem exhibits none of the flaws listed in the validation criteria. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and formalizable problem in cellular neuroscience.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will now be derived.\n\nThe model describes neurotransmitter release as a series of $N$ independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial represents a release site. The probability of success (vesicle release) for each trial is $p$. The number of vesicles released upon the arrival of the first action potential, $k_1$, therefore follows a binomial distribution, $k_1 \\sim B(N, p)$. The amplitude of the postsynaptic response, $A_1$, is the number of vesicles released multiplied by the fixed quantal size $q$, so $A_1 = k_1 q$.\n\nThe mean and variance of a binomial distribution $B(n, p')$ are $np'$ and $np'(1-p')$, respectively. For the first pulse (P1), we have $n=N$ and $p'=p$.\n\nThe mean amplitude of the first pulse, $\\mathbb{E}[A_1]$, is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[A_1] = \\mathbb{E}[k_1 q] = q \\mathbb{E}[k_1] = Npq $$\nThe variance of the amplitude of the first pulse, $\\text{Var}(A_1)$, is:\n$$ \\text{Var}(A_1) = \\text{Var}(k_1 q) = q^2 \\text{Var}(k_1) = Npq^2(1-p) $$\nThe standard deviation of the amplitude is $\\sigma_{A_1} = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(A_1)} = q\\sqrt{Np(1-p)}$.\n\nThe coefficient of variation for the first pulse, $CV_1$, is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean:\n$$ CV_1 = \\frac{\\sigma_{A_1}}{\\mathbb{E}[A_1]} = \\frac{q\\sqrt{Np(1-p)}}{Npq} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1-p}}{\\sqrt{Np}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-p}{Np}} $$\nNote that $CV_1$ is independent of the quantal size $q$. A purely postsynaptic change (a change in $q$) would not alter the $CV$, while a presynaptic change (a change in $N$ or $p$) would. The inverse relationship between $CV_1$ and $p$ (for $p \\ll 1$) is a classic indicator of presynaptic locus.\n\nFor the second pulse (P2), the problem states that there is no replenishment of vesicles. If $k_1$ vesicles were released during P1, then only $N-k_1$ sites are available to release during P2. The release probability $p$ remains the same for the remaining available sites, as there is no facilitation. The number of vesicles released during P2, $k_2$, conditional on $k_1$, follows a binomial distribution $k_2 | k_1 \\sim B(N-k_1, p)$.\n\nThe conditional mean of $k_2$ is $\\mathbb{E}[k_2 | k_1] = (N-k_1)p$.\nTo find the unconditional mean of $k_2$, we use the law of total expectation: $\\mathbb{E}[k_2] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[k_2 | k_1]]$.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[k_2] = \\mathbb{E}[(N-k_1)p] = p \\mathbb{E}[N-k_1] = p(N - \\mathbb{E}[k_1]) $$\nSubstituting $\\mathbb{E}[k_1] = Np$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[k_2] = p(N - Np) = Np(1-p) $$\nThe mean amplitude of the second pulse, $\\mathbb{E}[A_2]$, is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[A_2] = \\mathbb{E}[k_2 q] = q \\mathbb{E}[k_2] = Npq(1-p) $$\n\nThe Paired-Pulse Ratio, $PPR$, is the ratio of the mean second-pulse amplitude to the mean first-pulse amplitude:\n$$ PPR = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[A_2]}{\\mathbb{E}[A_1]} = \\frac{Npq(1-p)}{Npq} = 1-p $$\nThis simple and powerful result shows that, under the assumption of pure depletion, the $PPR$ is determined solely by the initial release probability $p$. This provides a direct method to estimate $p$ experimentally. An increase in $PPR$ signifies a decrease in $p$, which is a hallmark of a presynaptic mechanism of inhibition. A purely postsynaptic modulation would change $q$, which would affect $\\mathbb{E}[A_1]$ and $\\mathbb{E}[A_2]$ proportionally, leaving the $PPR$ unchanged. The problem's premise that endocannabinoids decrease $p$ is therefore consistent with a presynaptic locus of action.\n\nNow, we calculate the four requested quantities using the derived formulas for the two conditions.\nGiven: $N=10$, $p_{\\text{control}}=0.4$, $p_{\\text{eCB}}=0.2$.\n\n1.  **$PPR_{\\text{control}}$**:\n    $$ PPR_{\\text{control}} = 1 - p_{\\text{control}} = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6 $$\n\n2.  **$PPR_{\\text{eCB}}$**:\n    $$ PPR_{\\text{eCB}} = 1 - p_{\\text{eCB}} = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 $$\n    As predicted, the decrease in release probability from $0.4$ to $0.2$ leads to an increase in the $PPR$.\n\n3.  **$CV_{\\text{control}}$**:\n    $$ CV_{\\text{control}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-p_{\\text{control}}}{N p_{\\text{control}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-0.4}{10 \\times 0.4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.6}{4}} = \\sqrt{0.15} \\approx 0.38729... $$\n    Rounding to three significant figures gives $0.387$.\n\n4.  **$CV_{\\text{eCB}}$**:\n    $$ CV_{\\text{eCB}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-p_{\\text{eCB}}}{N p_{\\text{eCB}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-0.2}{10 \\times 0.2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.8}{2}} = \\sqrt{0.4} \\approx 0.63245... $$\n    Rounding to three significant figures gives $0.632$.\n    As predicted, the decrease in release probability leads to an increase in the coefficient of variation.\n\nThe calculated changes ($PPR$ increases, $CV$ increases) are both classic signatures of a presynaptic decrease in release probability, confirming the presynaptic locus of endocannabinoid action within this model.\n\nThe final numerical results, rounded to three significant figures, are:\n- $PPR_{\\text{control}} = 0.600$\n- $PPR_{\\text{eCB}} = 0.800$\n- $CV_{\\text{control}} = 0.387$\n- $CV_{\\text{eCB}} = 0.632$\nThese are to be presented in the specified order $[PPR_{\\text{control}}, PPR_{\\text{eCB}}, CV_{\\text{control}}, CV_{\\text{eCB}}]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.600  0.800  0.387  0.632\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2747510"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theoretical models to the laboratory bench introduces new challenges, as real-world data can be contaminated by technical artifacts.

Conclude DSE because $\\mathrm{PPR}$ increased from $\\mathrm{PPR}_0=1.10$ to $\\mathrm{PPR}_1=1.50$. No further controls are necessary if $\\mathrm{PPR}$ increases, as this proves a presynaptic mechanism.

Quantify possible $R_s$ artifact by approximating the change in driving-force error $\\Delta V \\approx I_0\\,\\Delta R_s$ with $\\Delta R_s=4\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$, yielding a fractional current decrease $\\Delta I/I_0\\approx \\Delta V/(V_\\mathrm{hold}-E_\\mathrm{rev})$. If this predicted artifact is small compared to the observed suppression, and a time-matched no-depolarization control shows only minor rundown (e.g., $6\\%$), then add critical controls: block CB1 receptors (e.g., SR$141716\\mathrm{A}$/AM$251$) to abolish the effect; inhibit diacylglycerol lipase-$\\alpha$ to prevent 2-arachidonoylglycerol synthesis; require $R_s20\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$ and drift $20\\%$ with continuous per-sweep monitoring; exclude sweeps or cells in which EPSC amplitudes correlate with $R_s$ (e.g., significant Pearson correlation); interleave an unstimulated or independent pathway to track rundown; and confirm a presynaptic signature (increase in $\\mathrm{PPR}$ and coefficient-of-variation analysis). If all are satisfied, conclude genuine retrograde endocannabinoid suppression.\n\nC. Use aggressive series resistance compensation (e.g., $90\\%$) to eliminate $R_s$ artifacts and rely on this alone.

I will proceed with a full analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Derivation and Analysis**\n\nThe task is to assess the contribution of artifacts to the observed synaptic depression and to define a rigorous set of controls.\n\nFirst, we quantify the observed effect. The EPSC amplitude decreases from a baseline of $I_0 = 320\\,\\mathrm{pA}$ to a post-depolarization value of $I_1 = 190\\,\\mathrm{pA}$. The fractional suppression is:\n$$\n\\text{Suppression} = \\frac{I_0 - I_1}{I_0} = \\frac{320\\,\\mathrm{pA} - 190\\,\\mathrm{pA}}{320\\,\\mathrm{pA}} = \\frac{130}{320} \\approx 0.406 = 40.6\\%\n$$\nSimultaneously, the paired-pulse ratio increases from $\\mathrm{PPR}_0=1.10$ to $\\mathrm{PPR}_1=1.50$. This increase in PPR is a classic signature of a decrease in presynaptic release probability, consistent with the canonical mechanism of DSE.\n\nNext, we must dissect the contributions of the two specified artifacts: rundown and series resistance ($R_s$) error.\n\n**1. Rundown Analysis**\nA time-matched control experiment, which omits the DSE-inducing depolarization, shows a $6\\%$ decrease in EPSC amplitude. This is our best estimate for the contribution of time-dependent rundown. Therefore, a portion of the $40.6\\%$ suppression is attributable to this non-specific effect. The suppression potentially related to the depolarization protocol is approximately $40.6\\% - 6\\% = 34.6\\%$.\n\n**2. Series Resistance ($R_s$) Error Analysis**\nAn increase in $R_s$ reduces the quality of the voltage clamp, causing the true membrane potential at the synapse to be less hyperpolarized than the command potential, which in turn reduces the driving force and the measured current. We must quantify this effect.\n\nThe problem states $R_s$ compensation is $70\\%$. The uncompensated series resistance, $R_{s,u}$, is therefore $30\\%$ of the total $R_s$.\n- Baseline: $R_{s,0} = 12\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega \\implies R_{s,u,0} = 12\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega \\times (1 - 0.70) = 3.6\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$.\n- Post-depolarization: $R_{s,1} = 16\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega \\implies R_{s,u,1} = 16\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega \\times (1 - 0.70) = 4.8\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$.\n\nThe voltage error is $\\Delta V = I R_{s,u}$. The actual synaptic potential is $V_m = V_\\mathrm{cmd} + I R_{s,u}$. The synaptic current is $I = g_\\mathrm{syn}(V_m - E_\\mathrm{rev})$. Combining these, we get $I = g_\\mathrm{syn}(V_\\mathrm{cmd} + I R_{s,u} - E_\\mathrm{rev})$, which rearranges to:\n$$\nI = \\frac{g_\\mathrm{syn}(V_\\mathrm{cmd} - E_\\mathrm{rev})}{1 - g_\\mathrm{syn}R_{s,u}}\n$$\nWe use the baseline data ($I_0 = -320\\,\\mathrm{pA}$, an inward current) to calculate the true baseline synaptic conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{syn},0}$. Note that $V_\\mathrm{cmd} = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and $E_\\mathrm{rev} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n$$\n-320 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A} = \\frac{g_{\\mathrm{syn},0}(-70 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V})}{1 - g_{\\mathrm{syn},0}(3.6 \\times 10^6\\,\\Omega)}\n$$\nSolving for $g_{\\mathrm{syn},0}$ yields $g_{\\mathrm{syn},0} \\approx 4.65\\,\\mathrm{nS}$.\n\nNow, we calculate what current, $I'_{1}$, would be measured if the *only* thing that changed was the series resistance (i.e., assuming $g_{\\mathrm{syn}}$ remains $4.65\\,\\mathrm{nS}$).\n$$\nI'_{1} = \\frac{(4.65 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S})(-70 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V})}{1 - (4.65 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S})(4.8 \\times 10^6\\,\\Omega)} = \\frac{-3.255 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{A}}{1 - 0.02232} \\approx -3.18 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{A} = -318\\,\\mathrm{pA}.\n$$\nThe increase in $R_s$ from $12\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$ to $16\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$ would, by itself, cause the measured EPSC amplitude to decrease from $320\\,\\mathrm{pA}$ to $318\\,\\mathrm{pA}$. This corresponds to a fractional decrease of $(320-318)/320 \\approx 0.6\\%$.\n\nThis quantitative analysis demonstrates that the $R_s$ change contributes a negligible-to-minor artifact ($\\approx 0.6\\%$) to the total observed suppression ($40.6\\%$). Combined with the rundown ($6\\%$), the total artifact contribution is less than $7\\%$. The remaining suppression of $\\approx 34\\%$ is substantial and, coupled with the large increase in PPR, strongly points to a genuine DSE phenomenon. However, a definitive conclusion requires rigorous experimental controls.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Conclude DSE because PPR increased from $\\mathrm{PPR}_0=1.10$ to $\\mathrm{PPR}_1=1.50$. No further controls are necessary if $\\mathrm{PPR}$ increases, as this proves a presynaptic mechanism. Variations in $R_s$ of this magnitude are negligible and can be ignored if input resistance and holding current are stable.**\nThis option advocates for a conclusion based on incomplete evidence. While the PPR change is highly suggestive, declaring it as \"proof\" without further controls is scientifically unacceptable. Most critically, it explicitly ignores the measured $6\\%$ rundown, which is a known confounding variable. A rigorous scientist never ignores known confounders. The assertion that stable input resistance and holding current renders $R_s$ changes ignorable is a dangerous oversimplification; while true that the effect is small *in this case*, it must be evaluated, not dismissed out of hand.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Quantify possible $R_s$ artifact by approximating the change in driving-force error $\\Delta V \\approx I_0\\,\\Delta R_s$ with $\\Delta R_s=4\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$, yielding a fractional current decrease $\\Delta I/I_0\\approx \\Delta V/(V_\\mathrm{hold}-E_\\mathrm{rev})$. If this predicted artifact is small compared to the observed suppression, and a time-matched no-depolarization control shows only minor rundown (e.g., $6\\%$), then add critical controls...**\nThis option presents a sequence of logical and scientifically rigorous steps.\n1.  It correctly proposes to first quantify the artifacts ($R_s$ and rundown). The approximation suggested for the $R_s$ artifact is a reasonable first-pass check, which, as shown above, confirms the effect is small.\n2.  It then lists a comprehensive set of controls that are the gold standard in the field for verifying a specific instance of endocannabinoid-mediated plasticity:\n    - **Pharmacology**: Use of a CB1 receptor antagonist (e.g., AM251) and a 2-AG synthesis inhibitor are essential to prove the molecular pathway. This establishes necessity.\n    - **Data Quality Control**: Strict criteria for $R_s$ magnitude and stability are fundamental for any voltage-clamp experiment.\n    - **Analytical Controls**: Correlating EPSC amplitude with $R_s$ provides a direct, within-cell test for instrumentation artifact. Interleaving an independent pathway is a superior method for tracking rundown compared to using a separate cell.\n    - **Presynaptic Signature Confirmation**: Further analysis of PPR and the coefficient of variation ($CV$) provides quantitative evidence for the presynaptic locus of expression.\nThis set of controls is both sufficient and necessary to justify a strong conclusion about retrograde endocannabinoid signaling.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Use aggressive series resistance compensation (e.g., $90\\%$) to eliminate $R_s$ artifacts and rely on this alone. Because compensation nulls $R_s$, no time-matched controls are needed; any decrease in EPSCs after depolarization must be DSE even if $\\mathrm{PPR}$ does not change.**\nThis option is deeply flawed and demonstrates a dangerous misunderstanding of electrophysiological technique.\n1.  Aggressive $R_s$ compensation (typically above $80-85\\%$) dramatically increases the risk of clamp oscillations, which can damage the cell and irretrievably corrupt the data. It is not a panacea.\n2.  The premise that compensation \"nulls\" $R_s$ is false. Compensation is never perfect.\n3.  The logical jump that $R_s$ management (however flawed) obviates the need for a rundown control is nonsensical. Rundown is a biological phenomenon entirely independent of the electronic recording conditions.\n4.  Dismissing the importance of a PPR change discards a key piece of mechanistic evidence.\nThis approach is reckless and based on invalid reasoning.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. To rule out rundown, increase the stimulation frequency to $10\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ throughout to stabilize synaptic output and verify that suppression persists. If suppression persists at high frequency, conclude DSE; pharmacology is unnecessary because high-frequency stimulation inherently controls presynaptic variability.**\nThis proposal is fundamentally flawed.\n1.  Increasing stimulation frequency from $0.1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ to $10\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ does not \"rule out rundown\". It introduces a massive, overwhelming confound: strong frequency-dependent short-term depression. The synaptic state at $10\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ is completely different from the baseline state, invalidating any comparison.\n2.  The claim that high-frequency stimulation \"inherently controls presynaptic variability\" is meaningless. It simply drives the synapse into a different, depressed state.\n3.  The assertion that pharmacology is \"unnecessary\" is the antithesis of modern molecular neuroscience. To claim an effect is mediated by a specific receptor (CB1), one must use pharmacology to block that receptor and show the effect disappears. Without this, the mechanism is pure speculation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2747498"}]}
