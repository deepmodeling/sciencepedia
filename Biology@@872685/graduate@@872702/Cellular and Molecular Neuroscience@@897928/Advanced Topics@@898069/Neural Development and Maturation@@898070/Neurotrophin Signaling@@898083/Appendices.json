It requires the derivation of an expression for the equilibrium areal density of a receptor dimer based on a set of clearly defined assumptions and starting principles. The derivation proceeds as follows.\n\nLet us define the areal densities of the species involved at equilibrium.\nLet $D$ be the areal density of TrkB dimers, in units of dimers per square micrometer. This is the quantity we must find.\nLet $R_{m}$ be the areal density of free, unoccupied, monomeric TrkB receptors.\nLet $R_{occ}$ be the total areal density of receptors that are occupied by the ligand, BDNF.\n\nThe problem states that the total areal density of TrkB receptors is $R$. Receptors exist in one of two states: as free monomers or as components of dimers. Therefore, the conservation of receptors is expressed as:\n$$R = R_{m} + R_{occ}$$\n\nAssumption (v) is critical: \"every ligand-occupied receptor is incorporated into exactly one dimer, with each dimer comprising exactly two ligand-occupied receptors\". This establishes a direct stoichiometric relationship between the density of occupied receptors and the density of dimers:\n$$R_{occ} = 2 D$$\n\nThe binding of the ligand $L$ to a free monomeric receptor $R_{m}$ to form an occupied receptor $R_{occ}$ is governed by the law of mass action. The dissociation reaction is $R_{occ} \\rightarrow R_{m} + L$. At equilibrium, the dissociation constant $K_d$ is defined as:\n$$K_d = \\frac{R_{m} \\cdot L}{R_{occ}}$$\nNote that the ligand concentration $L$ is a bulk concentration (molar), while $R_{m}$ and $R_{occ}$ are areal densities (receptors/μm²). This is a standard treatment for ligand-receptor binding at a surface, where $K_d$ has units of bulk concentration, consistent with the problem statement. Assumption (iv) states that $L$ is constant and not depleted by binding.\n\nWe have a system of three algebraic equations and seek to find an expression for $D$ in terms of the given parameters $R$, $L$, and $K_d$.\n\nFirst, we solve for the density of occupied receptors, $R_{occ}$. From the conservation equation, we express the density of free monomers, $R_{m}$, as:\n$$R_{m} = R - R_{occ}$$\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for $R_{m}$ into the equation for the dissociation constant:\n$$K_d = \\frac{(R - R_{occ}) L}{R_{occ}}$$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $R_{occ}$:\n$$K_d R_{occ} = (R - R_{occ}) L$$\n$$K_d R_{occ} = R L - R_{occ} L$$\n$$K_d R_{occ} + R_{occ} L = R L$$\n$$R_{occ} (K_d + L) = R L$$\n\nThis yields the expression for the areal density of occupied receptors:\n$$R_{occ} = \\frac{R L}{K_d + L}$$\nThis expression is a form of the Langmuir isotherm or Michaelis–Menten kinetics, describing the fraction of total receptors that are occupied at a given ligand concentration. The fraction of occupied receptors is $\\frac{L}{K_d+L}$.\n\nFinally, we use the stoichiometric relationship $R_{occ} = 2D$ to find the areal density of dimers, $D$:\n$$2D = \\frac{R L}{K_d + L}$$\n\nSolving for $D$, we obtain the final expression:\n$$D = \\frac{R L}{2(L + K_d)}$$\n\nThis result is physically sensible. When the ligand concentration $L$ approaches zero, the dimer density $D$ also approaches zero. When the ligand concentration is saturating ($L \\gg K_d$), the expression simplifies to $D \\approx \\frac{RL}{2L} = \\frac{R}{2}$. This is the maximum possible dimer density, which occurs when all receptors are occupied ($R_{occ} \\approx R$) and paired into dimers.

These NGF-bearing endosomes propagate retrogradely to the soma to trigger activation of Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK).

It is a straightforward yet physically meaningful problem in quantitative biology that can be solved from first principles. The solution process may proceed.\n\nThe total time delay, $T$, between the initial application of NGF at the axon terminal and the subsequent activation of ERK in the soma is the sum of the time delays of the sequential processes involved. The problem defines a two-step sequence:\n1. Signal initiation: A fixed lag time, $\\tau_{f}$, for receptor binding, endocytosis, and endosome maturation.\n2. Signal transport: The time required for the fully formed signaling endosome to travel from the distal axon to the soma. Let us denote this transport time by $\\tau_{\\text{transport}}$.\n\nBased on the principle of additivity of serial delays, the total time $T$ is the sum of these two components:\n$$T = \\tau_{f} + \\tau_{\\text{transport}}$$\n\nThe problem instructs to use the definition of kinematic transport, $x = v t$, where $x$ is distance, $v$ is speed, and $t$ is time. To find the transport time, $\\tau_{\\text{transport}}$, we rearrange this relationship. The distance to be covered is the axon length $L$, and the speed is the constant average drift speed $v$. Therefore:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{transport}} = \\frac{L}{v}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $\\tau_{\\text{transport}}$ into the equation for the total time delay $T$, we obtain the general formula derived from first principles:\n$$T = \\tau_{f} + \\frac{L}{v}$$\nThis is the expression for the total time delay as a function of $L$, $v$, and $\\tau_{f}$.\n\nNext, this expression must be evaluated for the given parameters: $L = 1\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and $v = 2\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m/s}$.

The derivative at $A=0$ is $\\frac{d(\\Delta W)}{dA}\\bigg|_{A=0} = -\\frac{10}{3} < 0$. This means that starting from $\\Delta W(0) = 0$, the function initially decreases, indicating a strengthening of LTD.\n\n2.  **Behavior as $A \\to \\infty$:**\n    As $A$ becomes very large, we look at the leading terms in the numerator and denominator of each occupancy function.\n    $$\\lim_{A \\to \\infty} \\theta_{\\mathrm{TrkB}}(A) = \\lim_{A \\to \\infty} \\frac{A^2}{A^2 + 2A + 12} = \\lim_{A \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + 2/A + 12/A^2} = 1$$\n    $$\\lim_{A \\to \\infty} \\theta_{\\mathrm{p75}}(A) = \\lim_{A \\to \\infty} \\frac{6A}{6.3A + 1.8} = \\lim_{A \\to \\infty} \\frac{6}{6.3 + 1.8/A} = \\frac{6}{6.3} = \\frac{60}{63} = \\frac{20}{21}$$\n    The asymptotic value of the plasticity index is:\n    $$\\lim_{A \\to \\infty} \\Delta W(A) = 1.1(1) - 1.0\\left(\\frac{20}{21}\\right) = \\frac{11}{10} - \\frac{20}{21} = \\frac{11 \\times 21 - 20 \\times 10}{210} = \\frac{231 - 200}{210} = \\frac{31}{210} > 0$$\n    Since the limit is positive, the system transitions to a state of LTP at high activity levels.\n\n**Conclusion of Analysis:**\nThe function $\\Delta W(A)$ starts at $0$, becomes negative for small $A$ (LTD), reaches a minimum negative value, and then increases, eventually crossing zero to become positive and approach a positive asymptote at high $A$ (LTP). This behavior is non-monotonic. The initial decrease signifies that LTD strengthens before the system switches to LTP. This is due to the different scaling of proBDNF (linear with $A$ at low $A$) and mature BDNF (quadratic with $A$ at low $A$), combined with the higher affinity of proBDNF for its receptor ($K_P=0.3$ nM vs $K_T=2.0$ nM).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\Delta W(A)$ increases monotonically with $A$, transitioning smoothly from LTD at low $A$ to LTP at high $A$ without any initial deepening of LTD.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The analysis showed that the derivative of $\\Delta W(A)$ at $A=0$ is negative ($-\\frac{10}{3}$). This proves the function is not monotonic; it initially decreases, meaning LTD deepens before the transition to LTP.\n\n**B. $\\Delta W(A)$ is non-monotonic: as $A$ increases from low to moderate values, LTD initially strengthens (more negative $\\Delta W$) due to proBDNF–p$75$NTR signaling, but at higher $A$ proteolysis shifts the balance toward mature BDNF–TrkB signaling, causing $\\Delta W$ to rebound and cross into LTP.**\nThis is **Correct**. This description perfectly matches the derived mathematical behavior. For low $A$, the proBDNF-p75NTR pathway dominates, causing $\\Delta W$ to become more negative. As $A$ increases, the activity-dependent proteolysis and quadratic scaling of mature BDNF concentration cause the TrkB pathway to dominate, leading to a rebound of $\\Delta W$ into the positive (LTP) range.\n\n**C. $\\Delta W(A)$ decreases monotonically with $A$, yielding progressively stronger LTD and no LTP even at high $A$.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The analysis showed that $\\Delta W(A)$ approaches a positive limit as $A \\to \\infty$, indicating a transition to LTP. Therefore, the function does not decrease monotonically.\n\n**D. $\\Delta W(A)$ is U-shaped with LTP at both low and high $A$ and LTD only at intermediate $A$.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The analysis for small $A>0$ shows that $\\Delta W(A)$ is negative. There is no LTP at low activity levels; there is LTD. The function starts at $0$, dips to negative, then rises to positive, which is not a \"U-shape\" with LTP at both ends.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2735243"}]}
