Nerve growth factor (NGF) binds TrkA with an effective dissociation constant that depends on whether TrkA is alone or in a heteromer with p75NTR. Assume steady-state reversible binding, a single binding site per receptor, and that the free ligand concentration is not depleted by binding because the receptor concentration is negligible relative to the ligand concentration. You are given the following experimentally determined parameters: the NGF concentration is $[{\\mathrm{NGF}}] = 50$ pM, the dissociation constant for NGF binding to TrkA alone is $K_{d,\\mathrm{TrkA}} = 100$ pM, and the dissociation constant for NGF binding to a pre-formed p75NTR:TrkA heteromer is $K_{d,\\mathrm{p75:TrkA}} = 20$ pM. \n\nStarting from the law of mass action and the definition of the dissociation constant $K_{d}$ for a reversible $1:1$ ligand–receptor interaction, together with conservation of receptor number, derive an expression for the fractional occupancy $f$ of receptors by ligand in terms of $[L]$ and $K_{d}$ under the stated assumptions.

We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part solution: first, the derivation of the fractional occupancy equation; second, the application of this equation to the two specified conditions; and third, the calculation of the fold change.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Fractional Occupancy Equation.\n\nLet $L$ represent the ligand (NGF) and $R$ represent the receptor (TrkA, either alone or as a heteromer). The reversible binding interaction is a $1:1$ process, represented by the equilibrium:\n$$\nL + R \\rightleftharpoons LR\n$$\nwhere $LR$ is the ligand-receptor complex.\n\nThe law of mass action for this equilibrium defines the dissociation constant, $K_d$, as the ratio of the product of the concentrations of the dissociated species to the concentration of the complex at equilibrium:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{[L][R]}{[LR]}\n$$\nHere, $[L]$ is the concentration of free ligand, $[R]$ is the concentration of free (unbound) receptor, and $[LR]$ is the concentration of the ligand-receptor complex.\n\nThe problem states as a simplifying assumption that the free ligand concentration is not significantly depleted by binding. This allows us to approximate the free ligand concentration $[L]$ with the total ligand concentration, which is given.\n\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R]_{\\text{total}}$, is conserved. It is the sum of the concentrations of free receptors and bound receptors:\n$$\n[R]_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [LR]\n$$\nThe fractional occupancy, $f$, is defined as the fraction of the total receptor population that is bound to the ligand:\n$$\nf = \\frac{[LR]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}}\n$$\nTo derive an expression for $f$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_d$, we must eliminate the terms $[R]$ and $[LR]$. We can express $[R]$ and $[R]_{\\text{total}}$ in terms of $[LR]$.\n\nFrom the definition of $K_d$, we rearrange to solve for $[R]$:\n$$\n[R] = \\frac{K_d [LR]}{[L]}\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for the conservation of receptors:\n$$\n[R]_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{K_d [LR]}{[L]} + [LR]\n$$\nFactor out the $[LR]$ term:\n$$\n[R]_{\\text{total}} = [LR] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1 \\right) = [LR] \\left( \\frac{K_d + [L]}{[L]} \\right)\n$$\nNow we can write the expression for fractional occupancy, $f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{[LR]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[LR]}{[LR] \\left( \\frac{K_d + [L]}{[L]} \\right)}\n$$\nThe term $[LR]$ cancels, yielding the final expression for fractional occupancy, which is the Hill-Langmuir equation for a single binding site:\n$$\nf = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_d}\n$$\nThis concludes the derivation.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of Fractional Occupancies.\n\nWe are given the following values:\nLigand concentration, $[L] = [{\\mathrm{NGF}}] = 50 \\text{ pM}$.\nDissociation constant for TrkA alone, $K_{d,\\mathrm{TrkA}} = 100 \\text{ pM}$.\nDissociation constant for the p75:TrkA heteromer, $K_{d,\\mathrm{p75:TrkA}} = 20 \\text{ pM}$.\n\nCase A: Fractional occupancy of TrkA without p75NTR ($f_{\\mathrm{without\\ p75}}$).\nHere, we use $K_d = K_{d,\\mathrm{TrkA}}$.\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{without\\ p75}} = \\frac{[{\\mathrm{NGF}}]}{[{\\mathrm{NGF}}] + K_{d,\\mathrm{TrkA}}} = \\frac{50 \\text{ pM}}{50 \\text{ pM} + 100 \\text{ pM}} = \\frac{50}{150} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n\nCase B: Fractional occupancy of TrkA when complexed with p75NTR ($f_{\\mathrm{with\\ p75}}$).\nHere, we use $K_d = K_{d,\\mathrm{p75:TrkA}}$.\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{with\\ p75}} = \\frac{[{\\mathrm{NGF}}]}{[{\\mathrm{NGF}}] + K_{d,\\mathrm{p75:TrkA}}} = \\frac{50 \\text{ pM}}{50 \\text{ pM} + 20 \\text{ pM}} = \\frac{50}{70} = \\frac{5}{7}\n$$\nThe presence of p75NTR increases the affinity of TrkA for NGF (i.e., lowers the $K_d$), which results in a higher fractional occupancy at the same ligand concentration.\n\nPart 3: Calculation of the Fold Change.\n\nThe fold change is defined as the ratio of the fractional occupancy with p75NTR to that without p75NTR.\n$$\n\\text{Fold Change} = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{with\\ p75}}}{f_{\\mathrm{without\\ p75}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\n\\text{Fold Change} = \\frac{5/7}{1/3} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{1} = \\frac{15}{7}\n$$\nThe problem requires this result as a decimal number rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\frac{15}{7} \\approx 2.142857...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $2.14$.

Consider mouse embryos at embryonic day $E18.5$ with the following well-established baseline facts and observations:\n\n- Fundamental base 1: The neurotrophin hypothesis states that target-derived neurotrophins support neuronal survival through receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. For the sympathetic lineage and peptidergic nociceptors, Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) is the critical ligand and TrkA is the cognate receptor; survival is mediated primarily through Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K)–AKT and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) cascades downstream of TrkA.\n- Fundamental base 2: The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) binds all neurotrophins with low affinity and modulates Tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) signaling. In the absence of Trk co-signaling, p75NTR can trigger apoptosis, particularly in response to proneurotrophins via Sortilin-dependent complexes. In the presence of TrkA, p75NTR can enhance ligand affinity and sharpen ligand specificity of TrkA for NGF relative to other neurotrophins such as Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3).\n- Empirical observation A (single knockouts at $E18.5$): In Ntrk1 knockout ($\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-}}$), superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neuron numbers are reduced to approximately $10\\%$ of wild type; small-diameter dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptors are reduced to approximately $30\\%$ of wild type; large-diameter proprioceptors and mechanoreceptors (largely dependent on TrkC and TrkB) remain near wild-type.\n- Empirical observation B (single knockouts at $E18.5$): In Ngfr knockout ($\\mathrm{Ngfr^{-/-}}$), SCG neuron numbers are modestly reduced to approximately $80\\%$ of wild type and target innervation is hypomorphic; DRG nociceptors are reduced to approximately $85\\%$ of wild type with aberrant branching. Ex vivo assays show that $\\mathrm{Ngfr^{-/-}}$ sympathetic neurons require higher NGF concentrations to achieve the same survival as wild type, but in limiting NGF, the addition of NT-3 partially supports survival; this partial support is abolished by pan-Trk inhibition. Addition of proNGF enhances apoptosis in wild-type cultures in a manner sensitive to p75NTR blockade but does not do so in $\\mathrm{Ngfr^{-/-}}$ cultures.\n- Empirical observation C (expression constraints): Single-cell RNA sequencing at $E14.5$ shows that the vast majority of sympathetic neurons and peptidergic nociceptors express TrkA robustly and do not co-express TrkB (Ntrk2) or TrkC (Ntrk3) at levels sufficient for survival signaling; by contrast, proprioceptors express TrkC and some mechanoreceptors express TrkB.\n\nUsing only the above bases and observations (and no additional assumptions), infer the compensatory mechanisms at play in the $\\mathrm{Ngfr^{-/-}}$ background and predict the outcomes for a double knockout $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-};Ngfr^{-/-}}$ at $E18.5$ for both sympathetic (SCG) and DRG nociceptor lineages, relative to the $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-}}$ phenotype. Which option is most consistent with the data and underlying principles?\n\nA. SCG and DRG nociceptor survival in $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-};Ngfr^{-/-}}$ remain as severely reduced as in $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-}}$ (approximately $10\\%$ SCG and $30\\%$ nociceptors), with at most a slight, non-significant improvement; mechanism: removal of p75NTR eliminates pro-apoptotic proNGF–p75NTR signaling but cannot substitute for the essential TrkA-mediated PI3K–AKT survival, and the NT-3–to–TrkA “backup” observed in $\\mathrm{Ngfr^{-/-}}$ is inoperative without TrkA.\n\nB. SCG survival in $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-};Ngfr^{-/-}}$ is rescued to near wild-type because the loss of p75NTR prevents apoptosis; DRG nociceptors are likewise rescued by compensatory NT-3 signaling through TrkB and TrkC that is unmasked when p75NTR is absent.\n\nC. SCG survival in $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-};Ngfr^{-/-}}$ is worse than in $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-}}$ because p75NTR is required for retrograde transport of survival signals independently of TrkA; DRG nociceptors are unchanged relative to $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-}}$.\n\nD. SCG survival in $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-};Ngfr^{-/-}}$ remains similar to $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-}}$, but DRG nociceptors are markedly rescued because, in the absence of p75NTR, TrkB and TrkC readily compensate via cross-activation that p75NTR normally suppresses.\n\nChoose the single best option.", "solution": "The problem statement shall be validated before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n\n*   **Subject**: Joint roles of Neurotrophic Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Type 1 ($Ntrk1$, also known as $\\mathrm{TrkA}$) and Nerve Growth Factor Receptor ($Ngfr$, also known as $p75$ neurotrophin receptor or $p75NTR$) in the survival of peripheral neurons (sympathetic and nociceptive) in mouse embryos at embryonic day $E18.5$.\n*   **Fundamental base 1**: Target-derived neurotrophins, specifically Nerve Growth Factor ($\\mathrm{NGF}$), support survival of sympathetic and peptidergic nociceptive neurons via the cognate receptor $\\mathrm{TrkA}$. This signaling is mediated by Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase ($\\mathrm{PI3K}$)–$\\mathrm{AKT}$ and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase ($\\mathrm{MAPK}$) cascades.\n*   **Fundamental base 2**: $p75NTR$ binds all neurotrophins with low affinity. It can enhance ligand affinity and specificity of $\\mathrm{TrkA}$ for $\\mathrm{NGF}$. In the absence of $\\mathrm{Trk}$ co-signaling, $p75NTR$ can trigger apoptosis, especially in response to proneurotrophins.\n*   **Empirical observation A**: In $Ntrk1$ knockout ($\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-}}$) mice at $E18.5$, superior cervical ganglion ($\\mathrm{SCG}$) neuron numbers are reduced to approximately $10\\%$ of wild type, and small-diameter dorsal root ganglion ($\\mathrm{DRG}$) nociceptors are reduced to approximately $30\\%$ of wild type. Other neuron types dependent on $\\mathrm{TrkB}$ and $\\mathrm{TrkC}$ are largely unaffected.\n*   **Empirical observation B**: In $Ngfr$ knockout ($\\mathrm{Ngfr^{-/-}}$) mice at $E18.5$, $\\mathrm{SCG}$ neuron numbers are reduced to $\\sim 80\\%$ and $\\mathrm{DRG}$ nociceptors to $\\sim 85\\%$ of wild type. $\\mathrm{Ngfr^{-/-}}$ sympathetic neurons require higher $\\mathrm{NGF}$ concentrations for survival. In limiting $\\mathrm{NGF}$, Neurotrophin-3 ($\\mathrm{NT-3}$) partially supports survival, an effect abolished by pan-$\\mathrm{Trk}$ inhibition. ProNGF enhances apoptosis in wild-type but not in $\\mathrm{Ngfr^{-/-}}$ cultures.\n*   **Empirical observation C**: At $E14.5$, sympathetic neurons and peptidergic nociceptors robustly express $\\mathrm{TrkA}$ but do not co-express $\\mathrm{TrkB}$ ($Ntrk2$) or $\\mathrm{TrkC}$ ($Ntrk3$) at levels sufficient for survival signaling.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded**: The premises are based on the canonical neurotrophin hypothesis and well-established roles of $\\mathrm{TrkA}$ and $p75NTR$ in developmental neuroscience. The described knockout phenotypes are consistent with published experimental literature. The problem is scientifically sound.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a set of consistent facts and asks for a logical deduction about a combined genetic perturbation ($\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-};Ngfr^{-/-}}$). The constraints are clear, and a unique inference is possible based on the provided information.\n*   **Objective**: The language is precise and quantitative where appropriate (e.g., neuron percentages). It is free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n*   **Completeness and Consistency**: The provided bases and observations are self-consistent and sufficient to reason through the problem. For instance, Observation C provides a crucial constraint that prevents incorrect lines of reasoning suggested in some options.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-formulated question of logical inference based on established principles in cellular and molecular neuroscience. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to predict the phenotype of a double knockout mouse, $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-};Ngfr^{-/-}}$, by synthesizing the provided information.\n\n1.  **Role of $\\mathrm{TrkA}$ ($Ntrk1$)**: Fundamental Base 1 and Observation A establish that $\\mathrm{TrkA}$ is absolutely essential for the survival of the vast majority of $\\mathrm{SCG}$ neurons and peptidergic $\\mathrm{DRG}$ nociceptors. Its genetic removal ($\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-}}$) leads to a catastrophic loss of these neuronal populations, reducing them to $10-30\\%$ of their wild-type numbers. This is the primary, dominant effect governing survival in these lineages. Any survival signal must, in this context, be mediated by a $\\mathrm{Trk}$ receptor.\n\n2.  **Role of $p75NTR$ ($Ngfr$)**: Base 2 and Observation B delineate a dual, modulatory role for $p75NTR$.\n    *   **Pro-survival/Enhancing**: In the presence of $\\mathrm{TrkA}$, $p75NTR$ enhances the affinity and specificity of $\\mathrm{TrkA}$ for its ligand, $\\mathrm{NGF}$. The phenotype of the $\\mathrm{Ngfr^{-/-}}$ mouse (milder neuron loss, higher $\\mathrm{NGF}$ requirement) confirms this enhancing role.\n    *   **Pro-apoptotic**: In the absence of $\\mathrm{Trk}$ signaling or in the presence of ligands like proNGF, $p75NTR$ can mediate cell death. Observation B confirms this, as proNGF-induced apoptosis is absent in $\\mathrm{Ngfr^{-/-}}$ cultures.\n\n3.  **A Key Compensatory Mechanism**: Observation B reveals a critical compensatory pathway. In $\\mathrm{Ngfr^{-/-}}$ neurons, $\\mathrm{NT-3}$ can partially support survival, and this support is \"abolished by pan-$\\mathrm{Trk}$ inhibition.\" Observation C states these neurons only express $\\mathrm{TrkA}$ (not $\\mathrm{TrkB}$ or $\\mathrm{TrkC}$). The logical deduction is that in the absence of $p75NTR$ (which normally \"sharpens\" specificity for $\\mathrm{NGF}$), $\\mathrm{TrkA}$ becomes more promiscuous and can be activated by other neurotrophins like $\\mathrm{NT-3}$. This is a $\\mathrm{TrkA}$-dependent backup mechanism.\n\n4.  **Prediction for the Double Knockout ($\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-};Ngfr^{-/-}}$)**: We must analyze the consequence of removing $p75NTR$ in a background where $\\mathrm{TrkA}$ is already absent.\n    *   The primary survival pathway through $\\mathrm{TrkA}$ is completely eliminated due to the $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-}}$ mutation. This is the overwhelming cause of cell death.\n    *   The \"pro-survival/enhancing\" role of $p75NTR$ is irrelevant. $p75NTR$ cannot enhance the function of a protein ($\\mathrm{TrkA}$) that is not present.\n    *   The compensatory \"backup\" mechanism involving $\\mathrm{NT-3}$ is also inoperative. This mechanism depends on $\\mathrm{TrkA}$ promiscuity (as deduced in point 3), so it cannot function in the absence of $\\mathrm{TrkA}$.\n    *   The only remaining function of $p75NTR$ to consider is its \"pro-apoptotic\" role. By removing $p75NTR$, we remove this source of cell death signaling. This could potentially rescue a small number of neurons that would have otherwise died due to $p75NTR$-mediated apoptosis.\n    *   Therefore, the phenotype of the $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-};Ngfr^{-/-}}$ double knockout should be phenotypically very similar to the severe $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-}}$ single knockout. The massive cell death due to lack of the essential $\\mathrm{TrkA}$ survival signal will persist. There may be a slight, but not significant, improvement in survival compared to the $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-}}$ single knockout due to the ablation of $p75NTR$'s pro-apoptotic activity. A major rescue is impossible because the primary survival machinery ($\\mathrm{TrkA}$) is absent.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. SCG and DRG nociceptor survival in $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-};Ngfr^{-/-}}$ remain as severely reduced as in $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-}}$ (approximately $10\\%$ SCG and $30\\%$ nociceptors), with at most a slight, non-significant improvement; mechanism: removal of p75NTR eliminates pro-apoptotic proNGF–p75NTR signaling but cannot substitute for the essential TrkA-mediated PI3K–AKT survival, and the NT-3–to–TrkA “backup” observed in $\\mathrm{Ngfr^{-/-}}$ is inoperative without TrkA.**\n    This option aligns perfectly with the derivation. It correctly identifies that the $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-}}$ phenotype is dominant. It correctly identifies the two key mechanistic consequences of the double knockout: (1) removing the minor pro-apoptotic signal from $p75NTR$ is insufficient to overcome the loss of the major pro-survival signal from $\\mathrm{TrkA}$, and (2) the compensatory mechanism seen in $\\mathrm{Ngfr^{-/-}}$ single knockouts is $\\mathrm{TrkA}$-dependent and thus non-functional in the double knockout.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. SCG survival in $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-};Ngfr^{-/-}}$ is rescued to near wild-type because the loss of p75NTR prevents apoptosis; DRG nociceptors are likewise rescued by compensatory NT-3 signaling through TrkB and TrkC that is unmasked when p75NTR is absent.**\n    This option is incorrect for two primary reasons. First, a rescue to \"near wild-type\" is implausible given the essential role of $\\mathrm{TrkA}$ (Base 1, Observation A). Second, the proposed mechanism of rescue via $\\mathrm{TrkB}$ and $\\mathrm{TrkC}$ is explicitly contradicted by Observation C, which states these receptors are not expressed at sufficient levels in the neuronal populations in question.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. SCG survival in $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-};Ngfr^{-/-}}$ is worse than in $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-}}$ because p75NTR is required for retrograde transport of survival signals independently of TrkA; DRG nociceptors are unchanged relative to $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-}}$.**\n    This option proposes that survival would be even worse. This implies a $\\mathrm{TrkA}$-independent pro-survival role for $p75NTR$. The provided information does not support this; in fact, Base 2 states that in the absence of $\\mathrm{Trk}$ signaling, $p75NTR$ promotes apoptosis. Therefore, removing $p75NTR$ should not make survival worse. The claim of a role in retrograde transport independent of $\\mathrm{TrkA}$ is an external assumption not supported by the givens.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. SCG survival in $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-};Ngfr^{-/-}}$ remains similar to $\\mathrm{Ntrk1^{-/-}}$, but DRG nociceptors are markedly rescued because, in the absence of p75NTR, TrkB and TrkC readily compensate via cross-activation that p75NTR normally suppresses.**\n    This option correctly predicts the SCG outcome but incorrectly predicts a marked rescue of DRG nociceptors. The proposed mechanism for this rescue, compensation by $\\mathrm{TrkB}$ and $\\mathrm{TrkC}$, is directly falsified by Observation C. There is no basis in the provided text for a differential outcome between SCG and DRG nociceptors in this context.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2769675"}]}
