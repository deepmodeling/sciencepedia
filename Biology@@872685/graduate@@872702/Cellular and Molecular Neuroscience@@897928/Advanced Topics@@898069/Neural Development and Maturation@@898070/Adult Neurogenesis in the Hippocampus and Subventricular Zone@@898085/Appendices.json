The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient, consistent information for a unique solution. Therefore, it is deemed valid, and we shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet us first formalize the events based on the provided marker definitions. Let $K$ be the event that a randomly selected cell is Ki67-positive ($Ki67^+$), $D$ be the event that it is Doublecortin-positive ($DCX^+$), and $N$ be the event that it is Neuronal Nuclei-positive ($NeuN^+$). The corresponding negative phenotypes are denoted by the complementary events $K^c$, $D^c$, and $N^c$.\n\nThe problem states that the total number of nuclei sampled is $N_{total} = 12,000$. The counts for the disjoint partitions of this sample space are given as:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Count of ($K \\cap D \\cap N^c$): $C(K \\cap D \\cap N^c) = 270$\n    \\item Count of ($K \\cap D^c \\cap N^c$): $C(K \\cap D^c \\cap N^c) = 335$\n    \\item Count of ($K \\cap N$): $C(K \\cap N) = 7$. Since $D$ and $N$ are mutually exclusive ($D \\cap N = \\emptyset$), this event is equivalent to $K \\cap D^c \\cap N$. Thus, $C(K \\cap D^c \\cap N) = 7$.\n    \\item Count of ($K^c \\cap D \\cap N^c$): $C(K^c \\cap D \\cap N^c) = 930$\n    \\item Count of ($K^c \\cap D^c \\cap N^c$): $C(K^c \\cap D^c \\cap N^c) = 2,065$\n    \\item Count of ($K^c \\cap N$): $C(K^c \\cap N) = 8,393$. This event is equivalent to $K^c \\cap D^c \\cap N$. Thus, $C(K^c \\cap D^c \\cap N) = 8,393$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe sum of these counts is $270 + 335 + 7 + 930 + 2,065 + 8,393 = 12,000$, which confirms the data's consistency.\n\nThe problem defines a \"neuroblast\" as a cell that is $DCX$-positive and $NeuN$-negative. Let us denote the event that a cell is a neuroblast by $N_b$. Formally, this is the event $N_b \\equiv D \\cap N^c$.\n\nWe are tasked with computing the posterior probability that a randomly sampled Ki67-positive cell is a neuroblast. This is the conditional probability $P(N_b \\mid K)$. The problem mandates the use of Bayes' rule, which is stated as:\n$$ P(N_b \\mid K) = \\frac{P(K \\mid N_b) P(N_b)}{P(K)} $$\nWe will compute each term using the frequentist definition of probability, $P(E) = \\frac{C(E)}{N_{total}}$, where $C(E)$ is the count of outcomes in event $E$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the prior probability of a cell being a neuroblast, $P(N_b)$. The total count of neuroblasts, $C(N_b)$, is the sum of all cells that are $D^+ \\cap N^-$, irrespective of their Ki67 status. Using the law of total probability on the counts:\n$$ C(N_b) = C(D \\cap N^c) = C(K \\cap D \\cap N^c) + C(K^c \\cap D \\cap N^c) $$\n$$ C(N_b) = 270 + 930 = 1,200 $$\nThe probability is therefore:\n$$ P(N_b) = \\frac{C(N_b)}{N_{total}} = \\frac{1,200}{12,000} = \\frac{1}{10} $$\n\nNext, we determine the likelihood term, $P(K \\mid N_b)$, which is the probability that a cell is $Ki67^+$ given that it is a neuroblast. This is the ratio of the count of Ki67-positive neuroblasts to the total count of neuroblasts.\n$$ C(K \\cap N_b) = C(K \\cap D \\cap N^c) = 270 $$\n$$ P(K \\mid N_b) = \\frac{C(K \\cap N_b)}{C(N_b)} = \\frac{270}{1,200} = \\frac{27}{120} = \\frac{9}{40} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the marginal probability of a cell being Ki67-positive, $P(K)$. This is the total count of Ki67-positive cells, $C(K)$, divided by the total number of cells. $C(K)$ is the sum of counts of all mutually exclusive Ki67-positive populations.\n$$ C(K) = C(K \\cap D \\cap N^c) + C(K \\cap D^c \\cap N^c) + C(K \\cap D^c \\cap N) $$\n$$ C(K) = 270 + 335 + 7 = 612 $$\nThe probability is:\n$$ P(K) = \\frac{C(K)}{N_{total}} = \\frac{612}{12,000} $$\n\nNow, we substitute these probabilities into Bayes' rule:\n$$ P(N_b \\mid K) = \\frac{ \\left( \\frac{9}{40} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{10} \\right) }{ \\frac{612}{12,000} } = \\frac{ \\frac{9}{400} }{ \\frac{612}{12,000} } = \\frac{9}{400} \\times \\frac{12,000}{612} = \\frac{9 \\times 30}{612} = \\frac{270}{612} $$\nThis result is identical to that obtained by the direct definition of conditional probability, $P(N_b \\mid K) = \\frac{P(N_b \\cap K)}{P(K)} = \\frac{C(N_b \\cap K)}{C(K)}$. This is expected, as Bayes' rule is a direct consequence of this definition.\n\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we perform the division and round to four significant figures:\n$$ \\frac{270}{612} = \\frac{135}{306} = \\frac{45}{102} = \\frac{15}{34} \\approx 0.44117647... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.4412$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4412}$$", "id": "2697933"}, {"introduction": "Measuring the rate of cell proliferation is fundamental to studying neurogenesis, but raw data can often be misleading. A key confounder in adult neurogenic niches is the large population of quiescent neural stem cells, which do not cycle and can dilute the labeling indices of proliferation markers like EdU. This practice [@problem_id:2698029] introduces a critical concept in cell kinetics—the growth fraction ($GF$)—and guides you through deriving and applying a model to correct for this quiescent population, allowing for a more accurate estimation of the true cell cycle length of actively dividing progenitors.", "problem": "Adult neural stem cells (NSCs) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and in the subventricular zone exist in two functional states: a quiescent state that does not traverse the cell cycle and an active state that cycles asynchronously. Proliferation markers that report deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis (for example, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU)) label only cells that pass through synthesis phase during the labeling window. Consequently, the presence of quiescent NSCs confounds naive interpretations of labeling fractions because unlabeled quiescent NSCs dilute the observed labeling index. To correct this, one can partition the population into an active fraction, the growth fraction (GF), of size $GF$, and a non-cycling fraction of size $1 - GF$, and explicitly relate the observed labeling fraction to the kinetics of the active subpopulation.\n\nConsider an experiment in which EdU is present continuously for a pulse of duration $\\Delta$ immediately prior to fixation. Assume the following are true for the active NSCs: they are at steady state, they cycle asynchronously with a well-defined synthesis-phase duration $T_S$ and total cell-cycle length $T_C$, and they incorporate EdU if and only if synthesis-phase overlaps any part of the EdU pulse. Quiescent NSCs never incorporate EdU. Let $L_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ denote the observed EdU-positive fraction among all NSCs (active plus quiescent). Under these assumptions:\n\n- Explain conceptually why the presence of quiescent NSCs causes $L_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ to underestimate the fraction of the active NSCs that traverse synthesis-phase during the pulse.\n- Starting from the definitions of $GF$, $T_S$, $T_C$, $\\Delta$, and the assumption of asynchronous cycling at steady state, derive an expression that relates $L_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ to $GF$, $T_S$, $T_C$, and $\\Delta$ in the non-saturating regime where the EdU pulse is not long enough to label all active cells.\n- In a dentate gyrus experiment, independent measurements yield $GF = 0.40$, $T_S = 6\\,\\mathrm{h}$, and the EdU pulse duration is $\\Delta = 1\\,\\mathrm{h}$. The observed EdU-positive fraction among all NSCs is $L_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.056$. Using your derived relationship, compute the corrected estimate of the active NSC cell-cycle length $T_C$.\n\nExpress your final answer for $T_C$ in hours, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard model from cell cycle kinetics applied to neurogenesis, providing all necessary parameters and assumptions for a unique solution. The problem is valid.\n\nThe solution is partitioned into three sections as requested: a conceptual explanation, a formal derivation, and a numerical calculation.\n\nFirst, we address the conceptual relationship between the observed labeling fraction, $L_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, and the quiescent cell population. The observed labeling fraction is defined as the number of EdU-positive cells divided by the total number of neural stem cells (NSCs), which includes both active and quiescent populations.\n$$L_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Labeled NSCs}}{\\text{Total Number of NSCs}} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Labeled NSCs}}{(\\text{Number of Active NSCs}) + (\\text{Number of Quiescent NSCs})}$$\nBy definition, quiescent cells do not cycle and thus cannot incorporate EdU. Therefore, all labeled cells must belong to the active, cycling subpopulation. The fraction of *active* NSCs that traverse synthesis-phase and become labeled during the pulse is a different quantity, which we shall denote $L_{\\mathrm{active}}$.\n$$L_{\\mathrm{active}} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Labeled NSCs}}{\\text{Number of Active NSCs}}$$\nThe total number of NSCs is necessarily greater than the number of active NSCs due to the presence of a non-zero quiescent population. Since the numerator (Number of Labeled NSCs) is identical for both expressions, but the denominator for $L_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ is larger than the denominator for $L_{\\mathrm{active}}$, it is a mathematical certainty that $L_{\\mathrm{obs}} < L_{\\mathrm{active}}$. The quiescent fraction, $1 - GF$, represents a pool of unlabeled cells that dilutes the observed labeling index, causing $L_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ to be a systematic underestimate of the true proliferative activity within the active NSC compartment.\n\nNext, we derive the mathematical relationship between the observables and the cell cycle parameters. Let $N_{\\mathrm{total}}$ be the total number of NSCs. The number of active cells is $N_{\\mathrm{active}} = GF \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{total}}$, and the number of labeled cells is $N_{\\mathrm{labeled}} = L_{\\mathrm{active}} \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{active}} = L_{\\mathrm{active}} \\cdot GF \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{total}}$. The observed labeling fraction is then:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{labeled}}}{N_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{active}} \\cdot GF \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{total}}}{N_{\\mathrm{total}}} = GF \\cdot L_{\\mathrm{active}}$$\nNow, we must find an expression for $L_{\\mathrm{active}}$. This is the probability that a randomly selected cell from the active, asynchronously cycling population becomes labeled during a continuous EdU pulse of duration $\\Delta$. A cell is labeled if its synthesis-phase (S-phase), which has duration $T_S$, overlaps with the time interval of the EdU pulse.\nLet the EdU pulse occur during the time interval $[0, \\Delta]$. For a given active cell, let $t_{\\mathrm{start}}$ be the time at which it enters S-phase. The S-phase for this cell occupies the time interval $[t_{\\mathrm{start}}, t_{\\mathrm{start}} + T_S]$. The cell will be labeled if and only if its S-phase interval intersects with the pulse interval, i.e., $[t_{\\mathrm{start}}, t_{\\mathrm{start}} + T_S] \\cap [0, \\Delta] \\neq \\emptyset$.\nThis condition is satisfied if the start of S-phase is not after the end of the pulse ($t_{\\mathrm{start}} \\leq \\Delta$) and the end of S-phase is not before the start of the pulse ($t_{\\mathrm{start}} + T_S \\geq 0$). Combining these, the cell is labeled if its S-phase begins at any time $t_{\\mathrm{start}}$ within the interval $[-T_S, \\Delta]$.\nThe length of this time window is $\\Delta - (-T_S) = T_S + \\Delta$.\nThe active cell population is assumed to be in a steady state and cycling asynchronously. This means the times at which cells enter S-phase are uniformly distributed over one full cell cycle period, $T_C$. The probability of a cell entering S-phase within any given time window is the length of that window divided by $T_C$. Therefore, the probability that a random active cell is labeled is:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{active}} = \\frac{T_S + \\Delta}{T_C}$$\nThis relation holds in the non-saturating regime, where $T_S + \\Delta < T_C$, ensuring no cell is counted twice from cycling completely through the non-S-phases within the pulse duration.\nSubstituting this expression for $L_{\\mathrm{active}}$ into our previous equation gives the final relationship:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{obs}} = GF \\cdot \\frac{T_S + \\Delta}{T_C}$$\n\nFinally, we use this derived formula to compute the cell-cycle length, $T_C$, from the experimental data. The given parameters are $GF = 0.40$, $T_S = 6\\,\\mathrm{h}$, $\\Delta = 1\\,\\mathrm{h}$, and $L_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.056$.\nWe rearrange the formula to solve for $T_C$:\n$$T_C = GF \\cdot \\frac{T_S + \\Delta}{L_{\\mathrm{obs}}}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$T_C = 0.40 \\cdot \\frac{6\\,\\mathrm{h} + 1\\,\\mathrm{h}}{0.056}$$\n$$T_C = 0.40 \\cdot \\frac{7\\,\\mathrm{h}}{0.056}$$\n$$T_C = \\frac{2.8}{0.056}\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\n$$T_C = 50\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed with three significant figures. Therefore, the corrected estimate for the active NSC cell-cycle length is $50.0$ hours.
