For this question, rely only on the following well-tested facts as foundational starting points: (i) morphogen signaling systems such as Shh establish position and fate via concentration-dependent transcriptional responses; (ii) Shh signaling is transduced by Patched/Smoothened to regulate Gli transcription factors, where increased Smoothened activity stabilizes Gli activators and suppresses formation of Gli repressors; (iii) cyclopamine rapidly inhibits Smoothened; (iv) Gli3 repressor (Gli3R) functions as a constitutive transcriptional repressor that antagonizes Shh target gene activation.

I will now proceed with the solution by evaluating each option.\n\n**Derivation and Option Analysis**\n\nThe key to discriminating between the absolute-concentration (peak detector) model and the time-integration (dose accumulator) model is to devise an experiment where the predictions of the two models diverge. The ideal experiment creates at least two conditions where one key parameter (peak concentration or integrated dose) is matched, while the other is varied.\n\n-   If conditions `$1$` and `$2$` have the same integrated dose ($D_1 = D_2$) but different peak concentrations ($\\max C_1(t) \\neq \\max C_2(t)$):\n    -   The time-integration model predicts the same outcome.\n    -   The absolute-concentration model predicts different outcomes.\n-   The use of cyclopamine allows for precise temporal control over the signaling duration, thereby controlling the integrated dose $D$.\n-   The use of Gli3R overexpression introduces a constant level of transcriptional repression, effectively increasing the signaling threshold required to activate target genes (like *Olig2*). This allows for testing the robustness of the signaling interpretation mechanism.\n\n**Option A Analysis**\n\n-   **Experimental Design**: This option proposes a direct and controlled comparison.\n    -   Regimen `$1$`: Continuous low Shh at $C_{\\text{low}} = 5 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$ for $4 \\, \\mathrm{h}$.\n        -   Peak concentration: $\\max C(t) = 5 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$.\n        -   Integrated dose: $D_1 = (5 \\, \\mathrm{nM}) \\times (4 \\, \\mathrm{h}) = 20 \\, \\mathrm{nM \\cdot h}$.\n    -   Regimen `$2$`: The problem describes a scenario with multiple pulses. To match the dose, let's consider just one high-amplitude Shh pulse at $C_{\\text{high}} = 20 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$ for $1 \\, \\mathrm{h}$ to achieve the same integrated dose.\n        -   Peak concentration: $\\max C(t) = 20 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$.\n        -   Integrated dose: $D_2 = (20 \\, \\mathrm{nM}) \\times (1 \\, \\mathrm{h}) = 20 \\, \\mathrm{nM \\cdot h}$.\n    This setup perfectly isolates the variables: $D_1 = D_2$ while $\\max C_1(t) \\neq \\max C_2(t)$. This is the correct way to structure the experiment.\n-   **Predictions**:\n    -   The prediction that the time-integration model leads to similar *Olig2* fractions (since $D$ is matched) while the absolute-concentration model leads to more *Olig2* in Regimen `$2$` (higher peak) is logically sound and directly follows from the model definitions.\n    -   The prediction that the more ventral marker *Nkx2.2* (which requires a higher Shh signal) might only be induced by the high peak in Regimen `$2$` is also a valid and insightful secondary prediction.\n    -   The use of Gli3R to increase the signaling threshold and test whether it can be overcome by increasing the integrated dose ($D$) is a powerful confirmation. Under the time-integration model, increasing exposure time or pulse number to double the dose should rescue the phenotype, as predicted. Under the absolute-concentration model, increasing the duration of a sub-threshold concentration (as in Regimen `$1$`) should not rescue the phenotype, also as correctly predicted.\n    -   The predictions regarding *Pax6* and the post-mitotic markers *Hb9/Mnx1* and *Isl1/2* are consistent with their known roles in neural tube patterning.\n-   **Verdict**: This option describes a well-conceived, logically rigorous experiment with scientifically correct predictions. It effectively distinguishes between the two models. **Correct**.\n\n**Option B Analysis**\n\n-   **Experimental Design**: This design compares conditions without properly controlling variables. It contrasts a continuous $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ exposure ($C=8\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $D=384\\,\\mathrm{nM\\cdot h}$) with a short pulse ($C=20\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ for $1\\,\\mathrm{h}$, $D=20\\,\\mathrm{nM\\cdot h}$). Both peak concentration and integrated dose are different, confounding any interpretation. The statement \"matched D is unnecessary\" is a fatal flaw in experimental logic.\n-   **Predictions**: The predictions are flawed.\n    -   The claim that under a time-integration model, applying cyclopamine at $t=24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ will have \"no effect on Olig2 maintenance\" is incorrect. Blocking the signal halves the integrated dose from $384\\,\\mathrm{nM\\cdot h}$ to $192\\,\\mathrm{nM\\cdot h}$, which would certainly have an effect if the required dose threshold falls between these two values. The statement presumes fate is irreversibly decided by $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$, an additional assumption not given in the problem.\n    -   The prediction that late Gli3R induction will \"expand Nkx2.2 ventrally\" is biologically false. Gli3R is a repressor of Shh targets; it would inhibit or reduce the *Nkx2.2* domain, not expand it.\n-   **Verdict**: This option proposes a poorly designed experiment and makes factually incorrect predictions. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C Analysis**\n\n-   **Experimental Design**: This option proposes a transient ($2\\,\\mathrm{h}$) block of a continuous signal. While this is a valid perturbation, the interpretation presented is flawed.\n-   **Predictions**:\n    -   The prediction that for a time-integration model, a \"transient interruption... will abolish Olig2 irreversibly\" because it requires \"uninterrupted signaling\" is a complete misinterpretation of the principle of integration. The mathematical definition $D = \\int C(t)dt$ is robust to transient interruptions; it simply means $C(t)=0$ during the block, leading to a small reduction in the final value of $D$. It does not \"break\" the integrator.\n    -   The prediction that Gli3R overexpression will cause *Nkx2.2* to \"expand ventrally\" is, again, biologically false. As a repressor, Gli3R antagonizes ventral fates.\n-   **Verdict**: This option is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the time-integration model and contains biologically incorrect statements. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D Analysis**\n\n-   **Experimental Design**: This option proposes applying a high-concentration Shh spike \"in the continuous presence of cyclopamine\". This is a self-contradictory and nonsensical experimental condition. Cyclopamine inhibits Smoothened, a crucial transducer of the Shh signal that acts downstream of the Shh ligand itself. If Smoothened is continuously blocked, the cell cannot \"see\" the external Shh, regardless of its concentration or duration. The effective signal $C(t)$ would be zero throughout the experiment.\n-   **Predictions**: The predictions are based on this invalid premise. It is impossible for the Shh spike to specify any fate \"regardless of cyclopamine\".\n-   **Verdict**: The proposed experiment is fundamentally flawed because it misunderstands the mechanism of action of the pharmacological agent used. It is an impossible experiment. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A is the only option that presents a logically sound and scientifically valid experimental strategy. It correctly sets up conditions to de-couple the integrated dose from the peak concentration and makes accurate predictions about the outcomes for each of the two competing models.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2733310"}]}
