The use of Michaelis–Menten kinetics for transporter function is a fundamental concept in biochemistry and neuropharmacology. The described mechanisms of cocaine as a competitive DAT inhibitor and amphetamine as a DAT substrate/releaser are cornerstones of addiction neuroscience. The experimental technique (FSCV) is accurately described. The problem is firmly rooted in established scientific principles of cellular and molecular neuroscience.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem presents a clear mathematical framework and asks for qualitative predictions based on specified changes to the model parameters. The question is unambiguous and allows for a unique, reasoned answer to be derived from the given information.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, technical language. The drug mechanisms are defined through their effects on specific terms in the governing equation ($K_m$, $J_{\\mathrm{rev}}$, $R_{\\mathrm{ves}}(t)$), avoiding subjective or ambiguous descriptions.\n-   The problem is self-contained, consistent, and does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria (e.g., it is not incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or trivial).\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution can be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nWe analyze the behavior of the dopamine concentration $C(t)$ under three conditions: control, cocaine, and amphetamine, based on the governing equation $\\frac{dC}{dt} = R_{\\mathrm{ves}}(t) + J_{\\mathrm{rev}} - U(C)$.\n\n**1. Control Condition**\n-   **Baseline:** In the absence of stimulation ($R_{\\mathrm{ves}}(t) = 0$) and assuming negligible basal reverse transport ($J_{\\mathrm{rev}} \\approx 0$), the steady-state concentration $C_{ss}$ is found by setting $\\frac{dC}{dt}=0$. This gives $0 = 0 - U(C_{ss})$, which requires $U(C_{ss}) = 0$. For the given Michaelis-Menten form of $U(C)$, this implies $C_{ss} = 0$. Thus, baseline dopamine is near zero.\n-   **Evoked Transient:** A brief stimulus provides a pulsatile release $R_{\\mathrm{ves}}(t) > 0$, causing $C(t)$ to rise. After the release ends, the decay is governed by $\\frac{dC}{dt} = -U(C) = -\\frac{V_{\\max}C}{K_m + C}$. This describes the clearance of dopamine from the extracellular space.\n\n**2. Cocaine Condition**\n-   **Mechanism:** Cocaine is a competitive inhibitor, so the uptake function changes to $U'(C) = \\frac{V_{\\max}C}{K_m' + C}$, where $K_m' = K_m(1 + [I]/K_i) > K_m$. The vesicular release $R_{\\mathrm{ves}}(t)$ is unchanged for a given stimulus, and $J_{\\mathrm{rev}} \\approx 0$.\n-   **Baseline:** The steady-state equation is $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0 + 0 - U'(C) = 0$, which again implies $C_{ss} = 0$. The baseline remains near zero.\n-   **Evoked Transient:**\n    -   **Peak:** During release, the net rate of change is $\\frac{dC}{dt} = R_{\\mathrm{ves}}(t) - U'(C)$. Since $K_m' > K_m$, we have $U'(C) < U(C)$ for any $C>0$. The clearance is inhibited. With the same release $R_{\\mathrm{ves}}(t)$ but reduced clearance, dopamine accumulates to a higher concentration, resulting in a **larger peak**.\n    -   **Decay:** The decay phase is governed by $\\frac{dC}{dt} = -U'(C)$. Since the clearance rate $U'(C)$ is smaller than in the control case, the decay will be **slower**.\n    -   **Area Under the Curve (AUC):** A larger peak and slower decay necessarily lead to an increased AUC, reflecting the prolonged presence of dopamine in the extracellular space.\n\n**3. Amphetamine Condition**\n-   **Mechanism:** Amphetamine increases tonic efflux ($J_{\\mathrm{rev}} > 0$), reduces evoked release ($R_{\\mathrm{ves}}(t)$ amplitude is smaller), and competes for uptake, which slows net dopamine clearance. Let's call the modified uptake function $U''(C)$.\n-   **Baseline:** The steady-state equation is $\\frac{dC}{dt} = J_{\\mathrm{rev}} - U''(C_{ss}) = 0$. Since $J_{\\mathrm{rev}} > 0$, it must be that $U''(C_{ss}) > 0$, which requires a non-zero steady-state concentration $C_{ss} > 0$. Therefore, amphetamine causes a **tonic elevation of baseline extracellular dopamine**.\n-   **FSCV Signal:** Crucially, FSCV with background subtraction measures phasic changes *relative to the local baseline*. The elevated tonic level $C_{ss}$ becomes the new \"zero\" for the measurement.\n-   **Evoked Transient:**\n    -   **Peak:** The stimulus evokes a smaller release $R_{\\mathrm{ves}}(t)$ than in control due to depletion of vesicular stores. The FSCV signal measures the deviation from the elevated baseline $C_{ss}$. Since the amount of dopamine released is smaller, the **evoked peak relative to baseline is reduced**. The problem statement correctly notes this effect can be progressive with repeated stimulation.\n    -   **Decay:** The decay of the phasic signal represents the return of $C(t)$ to the new steady-state level $C_{ss}$. This process is governed by the dynamics around $C_{ss}$. Amphetamine competes with dopamine for DAT, inhibiting dopamine's own clearance. This impairment of the clearance mechanism means the decay of the phasically-released dopamine back to baseline will be **slower**, and the overall transient will appear broadened.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n-   **A. Cocaine: baseline extracellular dopamine remains near zero between stimuli, the evoked peak is larger and the decay is slower, increasing the area under the curve. Amphetamine: the baseline extracellular dopamine is elevated prior to stimulation, the evoked peak relative to baseline is reduced and can progressively diminish with repeated stimuli, and the decay is slower with a broadened transient.**\n    -   This option perfectly matches the derived effects for both drugs. The description for cocaine (zero baseline, larger peak, slower decay) and amphetamine (elevated true baseline, reduced phasic peak in FSCV, slower decay) is fully consistent with the model.\n    -   **Verdict: Correct**\n\n-   **B. Cocaine: baseline extracellular dopamine shows a marked tonic elevation due to increased non-vesicular release, the evoked peak is reduced, and the decay is faster. Amphetamine: baseline remains near zero, the evoked peak is larger due to uptake inhibition, and the decay is unchanged.**\n    -   The description for cocaine is incorrect; it does not increase $J_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ and thus does not elevate baseline. It increases the peak, not reduces it, and slows decay, not fastens it. The description for amphetamine is incorrect; it elevates baseline, does not leave it near zero. It reduces the evoked peak, not increases it.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n-   **C. Cocaine: because uptake becomes saturated, the evoked transient decays faster to baseline with a smaller area under the curve, while baseline remains near zero. Amphetamine: reverse transport has no effect on baseline, but the evoked peak is greatly increased with a faster decay due to transporter cycling.**\n    -   The description for cocaine is incorrect. Competitive inhibition (increased $K_m'$) actually makes the transporter *less* prone to saturation at a given concentration and slows decay, not speeds it up. The description for amphetamine is incorrect; reverse transport ($J_{\\mathrm{rev}} > 0$) is the direct cause of baseline elevation.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n-   **D. Cocaine: uptake inhibition prolongs the rise time, yielding a slower and smaller peak with no change in decay, and it elevates baseline substantially. Amphetamine: reverse transport accelerates clearance, shortening the decay time, and it increases the evoked peak amplitude because more dopamine is expelled during exocytosis.**\n    -   The description for cocaine is incorrect on multiple counts: the peak is larger (not smaller), the decay is slower (not unchanged), and the baseline is not elevated. The description for amphetamine is also incorrect: it slows (not accelerates) net clearance and reduces (not increases) the evoked release amplitude.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2728176"}, {"introduction": "The drug-induced surge in dopamine is not just a transient signal; it actively reshapes the synapses it acts upon, a process known as synaptic plasticity.

The proportional change is defined as the ratio of the post-exposure EPSC amplitude to the baseline EPSC amplitude.\n\nThe macroscopic current, $I_{EPSC}$, flowing through a population of ion channels is governed by the equation:\n$$I_{EPSC} = N \\cdot P_o \\cdot i$$\nwhere $N$ is the total number of channels, $P_o$ is the probability that a single channel is open, and $i$ is the current through a single open channel.\n\nThe problem states that the channel exhibits Ohmic behavior. Therefore, the single-channel current $i$ is described by Ohm's law:\n$$i = g \\cdot (V_m - E_{rev})$$\nwhere $g$ is the single-channel conductance, $V_m$ is the postsynaptic membrane potential, and $E_{rev}$ is the reversal potential of the AMPAR. The term $(V_m - E_{rev})$ represents the electrochemical driving force.\n\nCombining these expressions, the total EPSC amplitude is:\n$$I_{EPSC} = N \\cdot P_o \\cdot g \\cdot (V_m - E_{rev})$$\nThis equation encapsulates the problem's assumptions of independent channels and linear summation of conductances.\n\nLet us denote the baseline state with the subscript `base` and the post-exposure state with the subscript `post`.\n\nFor the baseline condition, the number of functional AMPARs is given as $N_{base} = 50$.

The AMPAR open probability, $P_o$, is constant: $P_{o, post} = P_{o, base} = P_o$.\n3. The postsynaptic membrane potential relative to the AMPAR reversal potential, $(V_m - E_{rev})$, is constant: $(V_{m, post} - E_{rev}) = (V_{m, base} - E_{rev})$.\n\nTherefore, the post-exposure EPSC amplitude, $I_{post}$, is:\n$$I_{post} = N_{post} \\cdot P_{o, post} \\cdot g_{post} \\cdot (V_{m, post} - E_{rev})$$\nSubstituting the known relationships:\n$$I_{post} = (1.5 \\cdot N_{base}) \\cdot P_{o, base} \\cdot g_{base} \\cdot (V_{m, base} - E_{rev})$$\n\nThe question demands the calculation of the ratio $\\frac{I_{post}}{I_{base}}$. We construct this ratio using the expressions for $I_{base}$ and $I_{post}$:\n$$\\frac{I_{post}}{I_{base}} = \\frac{N_{post} \\cdot P_{o, post} \\cdot g_{post} \\cdot (V_{m, post} - E_{rev})}{N_{base} \\cdot P_{o, base} \\cdot g_{base} \\cdot (V_{m, base} - E_{rev})}$$\nGiven that $P_o$, $g$, and $(V_m - E_{rev})$ are constant, these terms cancel from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\\frac{I_{post}}{I_{base}} = \\frac{N_{post}}{N_{base}}$$\nThis demonstrates that under the stated conditions, the macroscopic current is directly proportional to the number of functional channels.\n\nSubstituting the relationship between $N_{post}$ and $N_{base}$:\n$$\\frac{I_{post}}{I_{base}} = \\frac{1.5 \\cdot N_{base}}{N_{base}}$$\n$$\\frac{I_{post}}{I_{base}} = 1.5$$\nThe result is a dimensionless number, as required.
