Upon lysosomal inhibition, effective $k_{\\text{deg}}\\approx 0$, so immediately after adding inhibitor at $t=0$ the trajectory becomes $\\frac{d[\\text{LC3-II}]}{dt}=k_{\\text{lip}}$, predicting a linear increase $[\\text{LC3-II}](t)\\approx [\\text{LC3-II}](0)+k_{\\text{lip}}\\,t$ whose initial slope directly reports $k_{\\text{lip}}$.\n\nB.

Lysosomal inhibition does not affect $k_{\\text{deg}}$, so $[\\text{LC3-II}]$ rises to a new plateau, from which the height of the plateau isolates $k_{\\text{deg}}$; the initial slope after inhibitor addition reports $k_{\\text{deg}}$.\n\nC.

The derivation must be based on first principles as specified: conservation of mass and standard reaction kinetics. We will systematically construct the model and then evaluate the provided options.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Governing Differential Equation**\n\nThe principle of conservation of mass states that the rate of accumulation of a species is equal to its rate of formation minus its rate of removal.\n\n-   **Accumulation Rate:** The rate of change of the concentration of LC3-II is given by the time derivative, $\\frac{d[\\text{LC3-II}]}{dt}$.\n-   **Formation Rate (Input):** The problem states that the lipidation process, which generates LC3-II, operates at a \"time-invariant average rate.\" This is the definition of a zero-order process. We represent this constant rate of formation as $k_{\\text{lip}}$. Its units are concentration per time (e.g., $\\text{M s}^{-1}$).\n-   **Removal Rate (Output):** The problem specifies that the clearance of LC3-II follows \"first-order kinetics with respect to $[\\text{LC3-II}]$\" via lysosomal degradation. This rate is therefore proportional to the concentration of LC3-II. We represent this as $k_{\\text{deg}}[\\text{LC3-II}]$, where $k_{\\text{deg}}$ is the first-order rate constant with units of inverse time (e.g., $\\text{s}^{-1}$).\n\nApplying the conservation of mass principle (Accumulation = Formation - Removal), we arrive at the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\text{LC3-II}]}{dt} = k_{\\text{lip}} - k_{\\text{deg}}[\\text{LC3-II}]\n$$\n\n**2. Steady-State Condition**\n\nAt steady state, the concentration of LC3-II does not change over time. This implies that the rate of accumulation is zero.\n\n-   **Mathematical Condition:** $\\frac{d[\\text{LC3-II}]}{dt} = 0$.\n-   **Implication for Parameters:** Substituting this condition into the governing ODE:\n    $$\n    0 = k_{\\text{lip}} - k_{\\text{deg}}[\\text{LC3-II}]_{\\text{ss}}\n    $$\n    where $[\\text{LC3-II}]_{\\text{ss}}$ is the steady-state concentration. Rearranging this equation reveals the relationship between the formation rate, degradation rate constant, and the steady-state concentration:\n    $$\n    k_{\\text{lip}} = k_{\\text{deg}}[\\text{LC3-II}]_{\\text{ss}}\n    $$\n    This result signifies that at steady state, the constant rate of LC3-II formation is exactly balanced by its first-order removal.\n\n**3. Analysis of Lysosomal Inhibition**\n\nThe problem asks to consider the effect of an acute pharmacological inhibition of lysosomal function (e.g., with bafilomycin A1). Such inhibitors block the V-ATPase, preventing lysosomal acidification, which is required for the function of degradative hydrolases. This effectively halts the primary removal pathway for LC3-II.\n\n-   **Effect on the Model:** The inhibition of lysosomal degradation means that the rate of removal becomes negligible. In our model, this corresponds to setting the effective degradation rate constant to zero: $k_{\\text{deg}} \\approx 0$.\n-   **Modified ODE:** Immediately following the addition of the inhibitor, the governing ODE simplifies to:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d[\\text{LC3-II}]}{dt} \\approx k_{\\text{lip}}\n    $$\n-   **Testable Prediction:** Let $t=0$ be the time of inhibitor addition. The concentration at this moment is the pre-existing steady-state level, $[\\text{LC3-II}](0) = [\\text{LC3-II}]_{\\text{ss}}$. We can solve this simplified linear ODE by direct integration:\n    $$\n    \\int_{[\\text{LC3-II}](0)}^{[\\text{LC3-II}](t)} d\\left([\\text{LC3-II}]\\right) = \\int_{0}^{t} k_{\\text{lip}} \\, dt'\n    $$\n    $$\n    [\\text{LC3-II}](t) - [\\text{LC3-II}](0) = k_{\\text{lip}} t\n    $$\n    $$\n    [\\text{LC3-II}](t) \\approx [\\text{LC3-II}](0) + k_{\\text{lip}} t\n    $$\n    This equation predicts that, for a short time after inhibition (during which the assumption $k_{\\text{lip}}$ remains constant holds), the concentration of LC3-II will increase linearly with time. The slope of this linear increase, $\\frac{d[\\text{LC3-II}]}{dt}$, is equal to $k_{\\text{lip}}$. Therefore, measuring the initial rate of LC3-II accumulation after blocking its degradation provides a direct measurement of the autophagic lipidation rate, $k_{\\text{lip}}$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n-   **Option A:** This option states the governing equation is $\\frac{d[\\text{LC3-II}]}{dt} = k_{\\text{lip}} - k_{\\text{deg}}[\\text{LC3-II}]$, the steady-state condition implies $k_{\\text{lip}}=k_{\\text{deg}}[\\text{LC3-II}]_{\\text{ss}}$, and upon lysosomal inhibition ($k_{\\text{deg}}\\approx 0$), the concentration increases linearly as $[\\text{LC3-II}](t) \\approx [\\text{LC3-II}](0)+k_{\\text{lip}}\\,t$, allowing the initial slope to measure $k_{\\text{lip}}$. Each part of this statement is in exact agreement with our derivation from first principles. **Correct.**\n\n-   **Option B:** This option proposes an ODE with a formation rate dependent on $[\\text{LC3-I}]$, $k_{\\text{lip}}[\\text{LC3-I}]$, and a zero-order removal rate, $k_{\\text{deg}}$. This contradicts the problem statement, which specifies a \"time-invariant average rate\" of formation (a constant) and \"first-order kinetics\" for removal. The model is fundamentally incorrect based on the provided assumptions. **Incorrect.**\n\n-   **Option C:** This option correctly formulates the kinetics with a constant input and first-order removal. However, it incorrectly identifies the removal pathway as \"proteasomal,\" which is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). The problem statement explicitly identifies \"lysosomal degradation\" as the primary removal pathway. Furthermore, it discusses proteasome inhibition (MG132), which is irrelevant to the question's focus on lysosomal inhibitors (bafilomycin A1, chloroquine). The biological context is misrepresented. **Incorrect.**\n\n-   **Option D:** This option claims that lipidation is negligible ($k_{\\text{lip}} \\approx 0$). This contradicts the premise of the problem, which is to construct a model that includes and ultimately allows for the measurement of the lipidation rate. It also incorrectly claims that lysosomal inhibition blocks autophagosome formation. This is factually false; these inhibitors block autophagosome *degradation*, leading to their accumulation, which is the very phenomenon being modeled. **Incorrect.**\n\nBased on rigorous derivation from the given principles, only option A provides a scientifically and mathematically sound description of the system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2720824"}, {"introduction": "Building on the conceptual model derived in [@problem_id:2720824], this practice provides a direct, hands-on application using simulated experimental data.

The governing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are provided.\n\nFirst, we estimate the lipidation rate $v_{\\mathrm{lip}}$. In the presence of Bafilomycin A1, lysosomal degradation is blocked. The dynamics of the LC3-II amount, $L_{+}(t)$, are described by the simplified ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dL_{+}}{dt} = v_{\\mathrm{lip}}\n$$\nAssuming $v_{\\mathrm{lip}}$ is a constant, integration with respect to time $t$ yields a linear relationship:\n$$\nL_{+}(t) = L_{+}(0) + v_{\\mathrm{lip}} t\n$$\nThis equation is of the form $y = c + mx$, where $y = L_{+}(t)$, $x = t$, the intercept is $c = L_{+}(0)$, and the slope is $m = v_{\\mathrm{lip}}$.

In the absence of the inhibitor, the dynamics of the LC3-II amount, $L_{-}(t)$, follow the full ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dL_{-}}{dt} = v_{\\mathrm{lip}} - k_{\\mathrm{deg}} L_{-}\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives an expression for the degradation term:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{deg}} L_{-} = v_{\\mathrm{lip}} - \\frac{dL_{-}}{dt}\n$$\nThe procedure specifies approximating the derivative $\\frac{dL_{-}}{dt}$ over an interval $[t_i, t_{i+1}]$ using a finite difference, $\\frac{\\Delta L_{-,i}}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{L_{-}(t_{i+1}) - L_{-}(t_i)}{t_{i+1} - t_i}$, and approximating $L_{-}$ over the same interval with the midpoint value, $L_{m,i} = \\frac{L_{-}(t_{i+1}) + L_{-}(t_i)}{2}$.

Substituting these values and the target condition $F(T; C_T) = 2$ into the equation gives:\n$$2 \\;=\\; 1 \\;+\\; \\big(F_{\\mathrm{ss}}(C_T) - 1\\big)\\,\\big(1 - \\exp(-2.0/0.7)\\big)$$\nThis equation must be solved for the required steady-state flux, $F_{\\mathrm{ss}}(C_T)$.\n$$1 \\;=\\; \\big(F_{\\mathrm{ss}}(C_T) - 1\\big)\\,\\big(1 - \\exp(-20/7)\\big)$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ss}}(C_T) - 1 \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-20/7)}$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ss}}(C_T) \\;=\\; 1 \\;+\\; \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-20/7)}$$\nThe steady-state flux $F_{\\mathrm{ss}}(C_T)$ itself depends on the Torin1 concentration $C_T$ according to the Hill equation:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ss}}(C_T) \\;=\\; F_0 \\;+\\; \\big(F_{\\max} - F_0\\big)\\,\\frac{C_T^{n_T}}{EC50_T^{\\,n_T} + C_T^{n_T}}$$\nWith the given parameters $F_0 = 1$, $F_{\\max} = 3$, $n_T = 1.5$, and $\\mathrm{EC50}_T = 15\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, this becomes:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ss}}(C_T) \\;=\\; 1 \\;+\\; 2\\,\\frac{C_T^{1.5}}{15^{1.5} + C_T^{1.5}}$$\nBy equating the two expressions for $F_{\\mathrm{ss}}(C_T)$, we can solve for $C_T$:\n$$1 \\;+\\; \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-20/7)} \\;=\\; 1 \\;+\\; 2\\,\\frac{C_T^{1.5}}{15^{1.5} + C_T^{1.5}}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2\\big(1 - \\exp(-20/7)\\big)} \\;=\\; \\frac{C_T^{1.5}}{15^{1.5} + C_T^{1.5}}$$\nLet the term on the left be denoted by $k$. We solve for $C_T^{1.5}$:\n$$k\\big(15^{1.5} + C_T^{1.5}\\big) \\;=\\; C_T^{1.5}$$\n$$k \\cdot 15^{1.5} \\;=\\; C_T^{1.5}(1-k)$$\n$$C_T^{1.5} \\;=\\; 15^{1.5} \\frac{k}{1-k}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $k$ into $\\frac{k}{1-k}$:\n$$\\frac{k}{1-k} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\frac{1}{2(1 - \\exp(-20/7))}}{1-\\frac{1}{2(1 - \\exp(-20/7))}} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2(1 - \\exp(-20/7)) - 1} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{1 - 2\\exp(-20/7)}$$\nTherefore, the concentration $C_T$ is:\n$$C_T \\;=\\; 15 \\left( \\frac{k}{1-k} \\right)^{1/1.5} \\;=\\; 15 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - 2\\exp(-20/7)} \\right)^{2/3}$$\nNumerically, $C_T \\approx 15 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - 2(0.057425)} \\right)^{2/3} \\approx 15 \\left( \\frac{1}{0.88515} \\right)^{2/3} \\approx 15 \\times (1.12975)^{2/3} \\approx 15 \\times 1.0847 \\approx 16.2706\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nSecond, the maximal chloroquine concentration $C_Q$ must be determined. The constraint is that the fractional change in Lysotracker intensity must not exceed a threshold $\\varepsilon = 0.05$:\n$$\\big|I(\\mathrm{pH}(C_Q))/I_0 - 1\\big| \\le 0.05$$\nThe intensity ratio is given by $I(\\mathrm{pH})/I_0 \\;=\\; \\exp\\big(-\\beta\\,(\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{pH}_0)\\big)$. Since chloroquine raises lysosomal pH, $\\mathrm{pH}(C_Q) \\ge \\mathrm{pH}_0$, which implies $I/I_0 \\le 1$. The absolute value can then be removed:\n$$1 - \\exp\\big(-\\beta\\,(\\mathrm{pH}(C_Q) - \\mathrm{pH}_0)\\big) \\le 0.05$$\n$$0.95 \\le \\exp\\big(-\\beta\\,(\\mathrm{pH}(C_Q) - \\mathrm{pH}_0)\\big)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm and rearranging yields the maximum permissible pH change, $\\Delta\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{allowed}}$:\n$$\\ln(0.95) \\le -\\beta\\,(\\mathrm{pH}(C_Q) - \\mathrm{pH}_0)$$\n$$\\Delta\\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{pH}(C_Q) - \\mathrm{pH}_0 \\le -\\frac{\\ln(0.95)}{\\beta} = \\Delta\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{allowed}}$$\nThe pH change caused by chloroquine is modeled by:\n$$\\Delta\\mathrm{pH}(C_Q) \\;=\\; \\Delta \\mathrm{pH}_{\\max}\\,\\frac{C_Q^{n_Q}}{EC50_Q^{\\,n_Q} + C_Q^{n_Q}}$$\nTo find the maximal $C_Q$, we set the induced pH change equal to the allowed limit, using parameters $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}_{\\max} = 1.0$, $n_Q = 2.0$, $\\mathrm{EC50}_Q = 8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, and $\\beta = 0.8$:\n$$1.0 \\cdot \\frac{C_Q^2}{8^2 + C_Q^2} \\;=\\; -\\frac{\\ln(0.95)}{0.8}$$\nLet the term on the right be denoted by $m$. We solve for $C_Q$:\n$$\\frac{C_Q^2}{64 + C_Q^2} \\;=\\; m$$\n$$C_Q^2 \\;=\\; m(64+C_Q^2) \\;=\\; 64m + mC_Q^2$$\n$$C_Q^2(1-m) \\;=\\; 64m$$\n$$C_Q^2 \\;=\\; 64 \\frac{m}{1-m}$$\n$$C_Q \\;=\\; 8\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{1-m}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $m$:\n$$\\frac{m}{1-m} \\;=\\; \\frac{-\\ln(0.95)/0.8}{1 + \\ln(0.95)/0.8} \\;=\\; \\frac{-\\ln(0.95)}{0.8 + \\ln(0.95)}$$\nThus, the maximal concentration $C_Q$ is:\n$$C_Q \\;=\\; 8\\sqrt{\\frac{-\\ln(0.95)}{0.8 + \\ln(0.95)}}$$\nNumerically, $C_Q \\approx 8\\sqrt{\\frac{-(-0.051293)}{0.8 - 0.051293}} \\approx 8\\sqrt{\\frac{0.051293}{0.748707}} \\approx 8\\sqrt{0.06851} \\approx 8 \\times 0.26174 \\approx 2.0939\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nThird, the exposure time $T$ is not a value to be computed but is a fixed parameter of the experimental design, given as $T = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n\nFinally, the dosing regimen is assembled from these three values, rounded to three significant figures as requested.\n$C_T \\approx 16.3\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$C_Q \\approx 2.09\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n$T = 2.00\\,\\mathrm{h}$\nThe final answer is presented as the row matrix $[C_T, C_Q, T]$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 16.3 & 2.09 & 2.00 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2720891"}]}
