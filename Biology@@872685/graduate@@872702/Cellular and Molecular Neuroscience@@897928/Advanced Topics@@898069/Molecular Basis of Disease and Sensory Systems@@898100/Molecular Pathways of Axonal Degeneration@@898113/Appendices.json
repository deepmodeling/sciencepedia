The sterile alpha and Toll/Interleukin receptor motif containing 1 (SARM1) enzyme is an $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ hydrolase whose activity is allosterically regulated such that increasing the ratio $[\\mathrm{NMN}]/[\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}]$ promotes activation. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is converted to NMN by nicotinamide riboside kinases (NRKs), and NMN is converted to $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ by NMNAT enzymes. Consider primary neurons in which the following fundamental reactions and facts hold: (i) NR $\\xrightarrow{\\text{NRK}}$ NMN; (ii) NMN $\\xrightarrow{\\text{NMNAT2}}$ $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ in axons; (iii) activated SARM1 catalyzes $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+} \\to \\text{ADPR/cADPR} + \\text{NAM}$, collapsing axonal energy charge; (iv) acute axotomy causes rapid degradation of NMNAT2 in distal axons, elevating $[\\mathrm{NMN}]/[\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}]$ and activating SARM1; (v) SARM1 deletion prevents Wallerian degeneration even when NMNAT2 is lost. You are given five experimental conditions that differ in NMNAT2 availability, SARM1 activation status, and timing of exogenous supplementation with NR or NMN. For each condition, judge whether exogenous NR or NMN supplementation can or cannot prevent axon degeneration and select all options that correctly state the outcome with a mechanistic justification consistent with the facts above. \n\nA.

The provided facts (i-v) constitute a closed logical system against which each experimental condition can be evaluated.\n\nThe core causal chain of axon degeneration, as specified, is: Axotomy leads to the rapid degradation of axonal nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2). The loss of NMNAT2 halts the synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ($\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$) from its precursor, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), via the reaction $\\mathrm{NMN} \\xrightarrow{\\text{NMNAT2}} \\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. This cessation of synthesis, coupled with continued basal consumption of $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ and potential production of NMN from nicotinamide riboside (NR) via nicotinamide riboside kinases (NRKs), causes the ratio $[\\mathrm{NMN}]/[\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}]$ to rise. This increased ratio allosterically activates the sterile alpha and Toll/Interleukin receptor motif containing 1 (SARM1) enzyme. Activated SARM1 is a potent $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ hydrolase, which catastrophically depletes the remaining axonal $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, leading to energetic collapse and axon self-destruction. Axon survival depends on preventing this catastrophic $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ loss.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option based on these principles.\n\nA. Wild-type neurons with intact NMNAT2 and autoinhibited SARM1 are pretreated with NR for $12$ h before axotomy. NR reduces Wallerian degeneration by sustaining axonal $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ and constraining the $[\\mathrm{NMN}]/[\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}]$ ratio, thereby delaying SARM1 activation.\nThis condition involves pretreatment with NR, a precursor to $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. Before axotomy, the pathway $\\mathrm{NR} \\xrightarrow{\\text{NRK}} \\mathrm{NMN} \\xrightarrow{\\text{NMNAT2}} \\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ is fully functional. Pretreatment for $12$ hours will increase the axonal pools of both NMN and, critically, $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. Upon axotomy, NMNAT2 is degraded, halting $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ synthesis. However, the axon begins this degenerative process with an elevated reservoir of $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. Because the initial value of $[\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}]$ in the denominator of the ratio $[\\mathrm{NMN}]/[\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}]$ is higher, it will take a longer time for this ratio to reach the critical threshold required for SARM1 activation. By delaying SARM1 activation, the catastrophic collapse of $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ is postponed, thus protecting the axon from degeneration for a longer period. The reasoning provided in the option is entirely correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\nB. Neurons lacking NMNAT2 (no axonal NMN $\\rightarrow$ $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ activity) with wild-type SARM1 receive NMN at the time of axotomy. NMN prevents degeneration by mass action, boosting $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ via alternative routes and outcompeting SARM1 for NMN.\nIn this scenario, the neurons are constitutively deficient in axonal NMNAT2. According to fact (ii), the conversion of NMN to $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ is impossible within the axon. Supplementing with exogenous NMN will therefore only serve to drastically increase the concentration of axonal NMN, the numerator in the allosteric ratio $[\\mathrm{NMN}]/[\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}]$. This will cause the ratio to rise sharply, leading to potent and rapid activation of SARM1. Consequently, this intervention would not prevent but rather accelerate axon degeneration. The justification provided is flawed: it posits \"alternative routes\" for $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ synthesis that are not given in the problem's rule set, and it incorrectly suggests SARM1 competes for NMN as a substrate, whereas NMN is its allosteric activator and $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ is its substrate.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\nC. Neurons lacking SARM1 undergo axotomy with or without NR or NMN supplementation. Supplementation is redundant with respect to axon survival; axons remain intact because SARM1-dependent $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ depletion cannot occur.\nThis scenario tests the necessity of SARM1 in the degenerative pathway. Fact (v) explicitly states that SARM1 deletion prevents Wallerian degeneration. SARM1 is the executioner enzyme responsible for the catastrophic depletion of $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. In its absence, even if axotomy causes NMNAT2 loss and a subsequent rise in the $[\\mathrm{NMN}]/[\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}]$ ratio, the final destructive step cannot occur. The axon is therefore robustly protected. Any supplementation with NR or NMN would alter metabolite levels but would be irrelevant, or \"redundant,\" to the primary outcome of axon survival, which is already guaranteed by the absence of SARM1. This statement is a direct and correct application of the provided facts.\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\nD. Neurons expressing a constitutively active SARM1 variant (NADase active independent of ARM-domain allosteric control) with intact NMNAT2 are pretreated with NR. NR fails to prevent degeneration because any increase in $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ is rapidly cleaved by SARM1.\nIn these neurons, SARM1 is always catalytically active, irrespective of the $[\\mathrm{NMN}]/[\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}]$ ratio. This creates a futile cycle where NMNAT2 synthesizes $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, and the constitutively active SARM1 immediately degrades it. This situation is intrinsically lethal to the axon. Pretreating with NR will boost the rate of NMN and subsequently $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ synthesis. However, this merely provides more substrate for the active SARM1 to consume. It cannot overcome the constant enzymatic drain of $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. The increased flux through this futile cycle would likely hasten energy collapse. Therefore, NR supplementation will fail to prevent degeneration. The provided justification that any synthesized $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ is rapidly cleaved is precisely the correct mechanism.\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\nE. Wild-type neurons are treated at axotomy with a saturating SARM1 active-site inhibitor that blocks SARM1 catalysis despite NMNAT2 loss; NMN is added simultaneously. NMN supplementation neither prevents nor provokes degeneration under these conditions, because SARM1 activation is pharmacologically blocked while NMN cannot be converted to $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ without NMNAT2.\nHere, two interventions occur at the time of axotomy: pharmacological inhibition of SARM1 and supplementation with NMN. The SARM1 inhibitor functionally phenocopies a SARM1 deletion by blocking its catalytic activity. As in option C, this neutralizes the executioner of degeneration, and the axon is protected. Simultaneously, axotomy causes NMNAT2 loss, meaning the added NMN cannot be converted to $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ in the axon. The addition of NMN is therefore incapable of boosting $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ to provide any benefit. While adding NMN would normally be pro-degenerative by activating SARM1, this effect is nullified because SARM1's catalytic function is already blocked by the inhibitor. Thus, under these specific conditions, NMN supplementation is inert with respect to the fate of the axon; it \"neither prevents nor provokes degeneration.\" The reasoning is sound and consistent with the established principles.\nVerdict: **Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACDE}$$", "id": "2731232"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of SARM1-driven degeneration is its potent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ($\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$) hydrolase activity.

The fundamental principle is the law of mass action, which dictates the rate of change of the substrate concentration.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the depletion time $t_{f}$**\n\nWe begin with the conservation equation for the concentration of $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, denoted as $[N]$. The problem states there is no synthesis or transport of $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. Therefore, the rate of change of $[N]$ is solely due to its enzymatic consumption by SARM1. The rate of this consumption is the reaction velocity, $v$.\n\nThe differential equation governing the system is:\n$$\n\\frac{d[N]}{dt} = -v([N])\n$$\nThe reaction velocity $v([N])$ is given by the Michaelis–Menten rate law:\n$$\nv([N]) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} E [N]}{K_{m} + [N]}\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the concentration of active SARM1 sites, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ is the catalytic constant, and $K_{m}$ is the Michaelis constant.
