This is a standard problem in molecular and cellular neuroscience.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is firmly grounded in established principles of taste biology.

The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The provided data (presence and absence of specific gene transcripts) are sufficient to uniquely determine the cell type and its primary function according to canonical models.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation From First Principles**\n\nThe classification of the taste cell is determined by analyzing the function of the proteins encoded by the given gene transcripts.\n\n1.  **Taste Cell Types**: Vertebrate taste buds contain three principal types of taste cells:\n    - **Type 1 Cells**: These are glial-like cells, primarily providing support. They may play a role in salt taste transduction, specifically amiloride-sensitive salt taste via the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Their mechanism of neurotransmitter release is not fully resolved but they do not form conventional synapses.\n    - **Type 2 Cells (Receptor Cells)**: These cells detect sweet, umami, and bitter tastants through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). They do **not** form conventional synapses. Instead, upon depolarization, they release adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a neurotransmitter through non-vesicular mechanisms, primarily via the CALHM1 channel. Because they do not use vesicular exocytosis, they lack essential proteins of the SNARE complex, such as SNAP25.\n    - **Type 3 Cells (Presynaptic Cells)**: These cells detect sour taste (and some forms of salt taste). They are characterized by the formation of conventional synapses with afferent nerve fibers. They release neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin, GABA) via vesicular exocytosis, a process that requires the SNARE machinery, including SNAP25.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Gene Expression Profile**:\n    - **T1R2 and T1R3**: The genes `T1r2` and `T1r3` encode the protein subunits T1R2 and T1R3. These two subunits form a heterodimer, T1R2/T1R3, which functions as the primary receptor for sweet tastants (sugars, artificial sweeteners). The robust expression of both genes is the definitive marker for a sweet-sensing cell.\n    - **PLCβ2, IP3R3, TRPM5**: This is the canonical intracellular signaling cascade downstream of sweet, umami, and bitter GPCRs in Type 2 cells.\n        - Activation of the T1R2/T1R3 receptor activates a G-protein (typically gustducin).\n        - The G-protein activates **PLCβ2**, which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol $4,5$-bisphosphate ($PIP_2$) into inositol $1,4,5$-trisphosphate ($IP_3$) and diacylglycerol (DAG).\n        - $IP_3$ binds to and opens the **IP3R3** channel on the endoplasmic reticulum, causing a release of Ca$^{2+}$ into the cytoplasm.\n        - The elevated intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ concentration activates the **TRPM5** channel, a monovalent-selective cation channel. Influx of Na$^{+}$ ions through TRPM5 leads to membrane depolarization.\n    - **CALHM1**: This gene encodes the calcium homeostasis modulator 1 protein, which forms a large-pore, voltage-gated ion channel. Upon sufficient depolarization, the CALHM1 channel opens and mediates the release of ATP into the extracellular space, where it acts as a neurotransmitter to activate purinergic receptors on afferent nerve fibers. This is the hallmark neurotransmitter release mechanism of Type 2 cells.\n    - **Absence of SNAP25**: SNAP25 is a critical component of the SNARE complex required for the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane (vesicular exocytosis). Its absence definitively rules out the cell being a Type 3 presynaptic cell and confirms it does not rely on conventional synaptic transmission. This is the expected profile for a Type 2 cell.\n\n3.  **Conclusion of Derivation**: The gene expression profile—T1R2/T1R3 for reception, PLCβ2/IP3R3/TRPM5 for signaling, and CALHM1 for ATP release, combined with the absence of SNAP25—unambiguously identifies the cell as a **Type 2 receptor cell specialized for sweet taste transduction**.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n-   **A. Type 2 receptor cell specialized for sweet transduction via the T1R2/T1R3 heterodimer, signaling through the PLCβ2–$IP_3$–IP3R3–TRPM5 pathway and releasing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through CALHM1 channels; absence of SNAP25 is expected.**\n    This statement is a perfect and complete description of the cell type as derived from first principles. It correctly identifies the cell type (Type 2), the modality (sweet), the receptor (T1R2/T1R3), the entire signaling cascade, the neurotransmitter release mechanism (CALHM1), and the reason for the lack of SNAP25.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **B. Type 3 presynaptic cell specialized for sour transduction using otopetrin 1 (OTOP1) and conventional synapses; SNAP25 positivity would be expected.**\n    This describes a Type 3 cell. The analyzed cell is a Type 2 cell. The provided profile shows an absence of SNAP25, directly contradicting the expectation of SNAP25 positivity for a Type 3 cell. The modality is sweet (T1R2/T1R3 expression), not sour.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. Type 1 glial-like cell specialized for amiloride-sensitive low-salt transduction via epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) subunits; transmitter release is predominantly vesicular.**\n    This describes a Type 1 cell. The analyzed cell is a Type 2 cell due to the GPCR-pathway gene expression. Furthermore, the absence of SNAP25 is incompatible with the claim of vesicular release. The genes for ENaC subunits were not reported in the profile.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. Type 2 receptor cell co-specialized for sweet and umami because T1R3 is present; ATP is released by vesicular exocytosis requiring SNAP25.**\n    This option correctly identifies the cell as Type 2, but it contains two fundamental errors. First, while T1R3 is part of the umami receptor (T1R1/T1R3), the umami receptor also requires the T1R1 subunit, which is not reported. Taste cells show modality-specific segregation. Second, it incorrectly claims ATP release occurs via vesicular exocytosis requiring SNAP25. The problem explicitly states SNAP25 is absent, and the presence of CALHM1 points to non-vesicular release.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **E. Type 2 bitter-sensing receptor cell inferred from PLCβ2, IP3R3, and TRPM5; expected to be SNAP25 positive and to release ATP via vesicles.**\n    This option correctly identifies the downstream signaling pathway, which is shared by bitter-sensing cells. However, bitter taste is mediated by the T2R family of receptors, not T1R2/T1R3. Most importantly, it incorrectly asserts that a Type 2 cell would be SNAP25 positive and use vesicular release. This is false; these are characteristics of Type 3 cells.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2760619"}, {"introduction": "The conversion of a chemical stimulus into an electrical signal is the essence of sensory transduction. In taste cells, this process hinges on the flow of ions across the membrane, which alters the membrane potential.

Upon an extracellular acidification step, an inward proton current of magnitude $I_{H} = 50$ pA is recorded in current clamp at the onset of the response. The cell has a membrane capacitance $C_{m} = 10$ pF.

Its magnitude, $5~\\mathrm{mV/ms}$, is relatively steep on the timescale of voltage-gated sodium channel activation, which typically occurs on submillisecond to millisecond timescales once depolarization approaches threshold. If the membrane were near a resting potential approximately tens of millivolts below spike threshold (for example, a difference on the order of $20$–$30$ mV), a sustained initial slope of $5~\\mathrm{mV/ms}$ would, in the absence of immediate strong countervailing conductances, be sufficient to bring the membrane towards threshold within a few milliseconds. Concretely, a $30$ mV depolarization at $5~\\mathrm{mV/ms}$ would require approximately $6$ ms if the slope were maintained, which is well within the activation window of voltage-gated sodium channels. Therefore, the computed initial rate is consistent with a rapid approach to spike threshold in Type III cells at response onset, supporting the view that OTOP1-mediated proton entry can provide a strong depolarizing drive that initiates action potential firing, with subsequent dynamics shaped by voltage-gated sodium and potassium channel engagement and any acid-sensitive leak modulation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.00}$$", "id": "2760640"}, {"introduction": "Pharmacological agents are indispensable tools for elucidating the function of ion channels, and understanding their mechanism of action requires quantitative modeling.
