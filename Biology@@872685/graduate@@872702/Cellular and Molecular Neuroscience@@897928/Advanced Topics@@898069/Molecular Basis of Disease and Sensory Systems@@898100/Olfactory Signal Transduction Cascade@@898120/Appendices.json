The foundation of this calculation is the law of mass action applied to ligand-receptor binding at equilibrium.\n\nLet $R$ denote an unbound receptor, $L$ denote an odorant ligand molecule, and $RL$ denote the receptor-ligand complex. The problem states that the binding is reversible and at equilibrium. The binding process is described by the chemical equilibrium:\n$$ R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL $$\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the concentrations of the species at equilibrium:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]} $$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptors, $[L]$ is the concentration of free ligand, and $[RL]$ is the concentration of the bound receptor-ligand complex. The problem provides the extracellular odorant concentration, which we assume represents the free ligand concentration $[L]$, as the number of receptors is typically small and their binding does not significantly deplete the ligand from the bulk medium.\n\nThe fraction of receptors that are occupied by a ligand, denoted by $\\theta$, is the ratio of the concentration of bound receptors to the total concentration of receptors, $[R_{\\text{total}}]$. The total receptor concentration is the sum of free and bound receptors: $[R_{\\text{total}}] = [R] + [RL]$. Thus, the fractional occupancy is:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_{\\text{total}}]} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]} $$\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_d$, we first rearrange the definition of $K_d$ to solve for $[R]$:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]} $$\nSubstituting this expression into the equation for $\\theta$ gives:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{\\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]} + [RL]} $$\nAssuming a non-zero ligand concentration, $[RL]$ is also non-zero, and we can divide the numerator and denominator by $[RL]$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1} $$\nThis expression simplifies to the Hill-Langmuir equation, which describes fractional occupancy for a system with a single class of independent binding sites:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]} $$\nThis fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, represents the probability that any single, independent receptor is bound to a ligand at equilibrium. The problem states that there are a total of $N_{\\text{total}}$ receptors per cilium, which behave as independent sites. The expected number of occupied receptors, $\\langle n_{\\text{bound}} \\rangle$, is therefore the total number of receptors multiplied by the probability of any one receptor being occupied:\n$$ \\langle n_{\\text{bound}} \\rangle = N_{\\text{total}} \\times \\theta = N_{\\text{total}} \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]} $$\nThe statement that the count of bound receptors is well-described by Poisson statistics is consistent with this framework.

This condition implies that the electrochemical potential of the ion is equal on both sides of the membrane (intracellular and extracellular).\n\nThe electrochemical potential, $\\bar{\\mu}$, for an ion of species $i$ is given by the sum of its chemical potential, $\\mu_i$, and its electrical potential energy:\n$$ \\bar{\\mu}_i = \\mu_i + z_i F \\phi $$\nwhere $z_i$ is the valence of the ion, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $\\phi$ is the electric potential.
