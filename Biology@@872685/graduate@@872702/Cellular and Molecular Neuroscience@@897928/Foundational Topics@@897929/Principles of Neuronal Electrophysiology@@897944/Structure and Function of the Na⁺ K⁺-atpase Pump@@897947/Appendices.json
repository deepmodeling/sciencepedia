In matrix form, this is given by $\\frac{d p}{dt} = Q^{\\top} p$, where $p$ is a column vector of state occupancies and $Q$ is the transition rate matrix, or generator matrix, of the Markov process. The entry $q_{ij}$ of this matrix for $i \\neq j$ is the transition rate from state $S_i$ to state $S_j$. The diagonal entries are defined as $q_{ii} = - \\sum_{j \\neq i} q_{ij}$, which ensures that the rows of $Q$ sum to zero.\n\nAt steady state, the probabilities are constant, so $\\frac{dp}{dt} = 0$. This leads to the system of linear equations $Q^{\\top} p = 0$. The transition graph of the cycle $S_0 \\leftrightharpoons S_1 \\leftrightharpoons \\dots \\leftrightharpoons S_5 \\leftrightharpoons S_0$ is strongly connected, meaning the Markov chain is irreducible. For an irreducible finite-state continuous-time Markov chain, there exists a unique steady-state probability vector $p$ whose components are all positive and sum to one.\n\nThe matrix $Q^{\\top}$ is singular, as its columns sum to zero.

This creates a full-rank square system of linear equations that can be solved uniquely for $p$.\n\nThe off-diagonal elements of the $6 \\times 6$ transition rate matrix $Q$ are defined by the given mass-action rate expressions. Let the states be indexed from $0$ to $5$. The non-zero off-diagonal elements are:\n- $q_{01} = k_{1f} \\,[\\mathrm{Na}]_{\\mathrm{i}}^{3}$\n- $q_{10} = k_{1r}$\n- $q_{12} = k_{2f}$\n- $q_{21} = k_{2r}$\n- $q_{23} = k_{3f}$\n- $q_{32} = k_{3r} \\,[\\mathrm{Na}]_{\\mathrm{o}}^{3}$\n- $q_{34} = k_{4f} \\,[\\mathrm{K}]_{\\mathrm{o}}^{2}$\n- $q_{43} = k_{4r}$\n- $q_{45} = k_{5f}$\n- $q_{54} = k_{5r}$\n- $q_{50} = k_{6f}$\n- $q_{05} = k_{6r} \\,[\\mathrm{K}]_{\\mathrm{i}}^{2}$\n\nThe matrix $Q$ is therefore:\n$$\nQ = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-q_{01}-q_{05} & q_{01} & 0 & 0 & 0 & q_{05} \\\\\nq_{10} & -q_{10}-q_{12} & q_{12} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & q_{21} & -q_{21}-q_{23} & q_{23} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & q_{32} & -q_{32}-q_{34} & q_{34} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & q_{43} & -q_{43}-q_{45} & q_{45} \\\\\nq_{50} & 0 & 0 & 0 & q_{54} & -q_{50}-q_{54}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem is to solve the system defined by the equations:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nQ^{\\top} p = 0 \\\\\n\\sum_{i=0}^{5} p_i = 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nLet us construct a new matrix $A$ by taking $Q^{\\top}$ and replacing its last row with a vector of all ones. Let $b$ be a column vector $[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]^{\\top}$. The system can then be written as $A p = b$, which is solved for the steady-state probability vector $p = (p_0, p_1, \\dots, p_5)^{\\top}$.\n\nOnce $p$ is determined, the net steady-state turnover rate, or flux, $J$ (in cycles per second) is calculated. This is the net probability current across any edge in the cycle. Due to the conservation of probability at steady state, this current is the same for all edges. We use the definition provided:\n$$\nJ = p_0 \\, q_{01} - p_1 \\, q_{10}\n$$\nA positive value of $J$ corresponds to a net flux in the forward direction ($S_0 \\to S_1 \\to \\dots \\to S_5 \\to S_0$), which represents the physiological transport of $3$ Na⁺ ions out of the cell and $2$ K⁺ ions into the cell per cycle.\n\nThe following program implements this logic. For each test case, it calculates the rates $q_{ij}$ based on the given concentrations, constructs the matrix $Q$, solves for the steady-state vector $p$, and computes the flux $J$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes and prints the steady-state turnover rate of the Na+/K+-ATPase\n    for several sets of ion concentrations.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Fixed rate constants (units are s^-1, mM^-n to yield s^-1 rates)\n    k_1f = 1e-3  # s^-1 mM^-3\n    k_1r = 5.0   # s^-1\n    k_2f = 50.0  # s^-1\n    k_2r = 5.0   # s^-1\n    k_3f = 100.0 # s^-1\n    k_3r = 1e-7  # s^-1 mM^-3\n    k_4f = 5e-2  # s^-1 mM^-2\n    k_4r = 5.0   # s^-1\n    k_5f = 50.0  # s^-1\n    k_5r = 1.0   # s^-1\n    k_6f = 100.0 # s^-1\n    k_6r = 1e-3  # s^-1 mM^-2\n    \n    # Test cases: (Na_i, Na_o, K_o, K_i) in mM\n    test_cases = [\n        (10.0, 140.0, 4.0, 140.0),    # Case 1\n        (10.0, 140.0, 0.0, 140.0),    # Case 2\n        (0.001, 140.0, 4.0, 140.0),   # Case 3\n        (20.0, 10.0, 4.0, 140.0),     # Case 4\n        (5.0, 150.0, 2.0, 20.0),      # Case 5\n        (1.0, 140.0, 5.0, 140.0),     # Case 6\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        Na_i, Na_o, K_o, K_i = case\n\n        # Calculate all 12 transition rates based on mass-action kinetics\n        q_01 = k_1f * Na_i**3\n        q_10 = k_1r\n        \n        q_12 = k_2f\n        q_21 = k_2r\n        \n        q_23 = k_3f\n        q_32 = k_3r * Na_o**3\n        \n        q_34 = k_4f * K_o**2\n        q_43 = k_4r\n        \n        q_45 = k_5f\n        q_54 = k_5r\n        \n        q_50 = k_6f\n        q_05 = k_6r * K_i**2\n        \n        # Construct the 6x6 transition rate matrix Q\n        Q = np.zeros((6, 6), dtype=float)\n        \n        # Off-diagonal elements (q_ij is rate from i to j)\n        Q[0, 1] = q_01\n        Q[0, 5] = q_05\n        Q[1, 0] = q_10\n        Q[1, 2] = q_12\n        Q[2, 1] = q_21\n        Q[2, 3] = q_23\n        Q[3, 2] = q_32\n        Q[3, 4] = q_34\n        Q[4, 3] = q_43\n        Q[4, 5] = q_45\n        Q[5, 4] = q_54\n        Q[5, 0] = q_50\n        \n        # Diagonal elements (rows sum to 0)\n        for i in range(6):\n            Q[i, i] = -np.sum(Q[i, :])\n            \n        # To solve for the steady-state probability vector p, we solve\n        # Q^T * p = 0 subject to sum(p) = 1.\n        # This is done by replacing one row of Q^T with all ones and\n        # setting the corresponding element in the target vector to 1.\n        \n        A = Q.T\n        A[-1, :] = 1.0  # Replace the last row with the normalization condition\n        \n        b = np.zeros(6, dtype=float)\n        b[-1] = 1.0   # Set the target for the normalization equation to 1\n        \n        # Solve the linear system A * p = b for p\n        try:\n            p = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\n        except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n            # This should not happen for an irreducible Markov chain\n            p = np.full(6, np.nan)\n\n        # Calculate the net steady-state turnover rate (flux) J\n        # J = p0*q01 - p1*q10\n        J = p[0] * q_01 - p[1] * q_10\n        \n        results.append(J)\n\n    # Format output as a comma-separated list of strings, rounded to 6 decimal places\n    formatted_results = [f\"{res:.6f}\" for res in results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2754637"}]}
