We begin from first principles, specifically Kirchhoff's current law.\n\nThe total injected current, $I_{inj}$, is constant for time $t \\ge 0$. This current distributes between the resistive (leak) pathway, $I_R$, and the capacitive pathway, $I_C$. According to Kirchhoff's current law, at any time $t$:\n$$I_{inj} = I_R(t) + I_C(t)$$\nLet $V(t)$ represent the change in membrane potential from its resting value, such that the initial condition is $V(0) = 0$. The current through the linear leak resistance $R_m$ is described by Ohm's Law:\n$$I_R(t) = \\frac{V(t)}{R_m}$$\nThe current that charges the membrane capacitance $C_m$ is given by the definition of capacitance:\n$$I_C(t) = C_m \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}$$\nSubstituting these expressions for $I_R(t)$ and $I_C(t)$ into Kirchhoff's law yields a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for the membrane potential $V(t)$:\n$$I_{inj} = \\frac{V(t)}{R_m} + C_m \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}$$\nThis equation can be arranged into the standard form for a first-order system:\n$$R_m C_m \\frac{dV(t)}{dt} + V(t) = I_{inj} R_m$$\nWe define the membrane time constant as $\\tau_m = R_m C_m$. The equation becomes:\n$$\\tau_m \\frac{dV(t)}{dt} + V(t) = I_{inj} R_m$$\nThe general solution to this differential equation with the initial condition $V(0) = 0$ for a constant $I_{inj}$ applied at $t=0$ is an exponential charging curve:\n$$V(t) = I_{inj} R_m \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_m}\\right)\\right)$$\nTo find the parameters $R_m$ and $C_m$, we use the two pieces of information provided about the voltage response.\n\nFirst, we consider the steady-state condition ($t \\to \\infty$). As $t$ becomes very large, the term $\\exp(-t/\\tau_m)$ approaches $0$, and the voltage $V(t)$ approaches a constant steady-state value, $V_{ss}$:\n$$V_{ss} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} V(t) = I_{inj} R_m$$\nThe problem states that the steady-state depolarization is $\\Delta V = 10 \\text{ mV}$, which corresponds to $V_{ss}$.
