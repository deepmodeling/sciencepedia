By employing a panel of *Salmonella* strains with different, well-defined mutations, we can deduce whether a chemical causes base-pair substitutions or frameshifts. This practice challenges you to interpret a classic multi-strain dataset to determine the specific type of DNA damage caused by a hypothetical compound [@problem_id:1525590].", "problem": "A toxicology research group is evaluating the mutagenic potential of a newly synthesized chemical, designated \"Compound Z\". They conduct an Ames test, a standard procedure for identifying chemical mutagens. The test utilizes several auxotrophic strains of *Salmonella typhimurium*, which carry mutations in the histidine biosynthesis operon and are unable to grow on a medium lacking histidine. The test measures the frequency at which the compound induces reverse mutations (reversions), allowing the bacteria to grow into visible colonies on a histidine-lacking medium.\n\nThe researchers use the following well-characterized tester strains:\n- **Strain TA1535**: Carries a specific missense mutation (`hisG46`) that resulted from a T-to-C transition. It can be reverted to a functional state primarily by mutagens that cause base-pair substitutions.\n- **Strain TA100**: Derived from TA1535, it contains the same `hisG46` missense mutation but also carries the plasmid pKM101. This plasmid enhances an error-prone Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) repair system (the SOS system), making the strain significantly more sensitive to a wide variety of mutagens that induce base-pair substitutions.\n- **Strain TA98**: Carries a frameshift mutation (`hisD3052`), a deletion of a single G-C base pair in a repetitive sequence. This strain is used to detect mutagens that cause frameshift mutations (insertions or deletions of nucleotides).\n\nFor each strain, two sets of plates are prepared on a minimal glucose medium with a trace amount of histidine. One set contains the solvent used to dissolve Compound Z (Control), and the other set contains Compound Z. After a 48-hour incubation period, the number of visible revertant colonies on each plate is counted. The average results are as follows:\n\n- Strain TA1535 (Control): 21 revertant colonies\n- Strain TA1535 (with Compound Z): 98 revertant colonies\n- Strain TA100 (Control): 115 revertant colonies\n- Strain TA100 (with Compound Z): 792 revertant colonies\n- Strain TA98 (Control): 42 revertant colonies\n- Strain TA98 (with Compound Z): 45 revertant colonies\n\nA compound is generally considered mutagenic if it causes at least a two-fold increase in the number of revertant colonies compared to the control. Based on the provided data and the characteristics of the tester strains, which of the following statements most accurately describes the primary mutagenic action of Compound Z?\n\nA. It causes frameshift mutations, likely by intercalating into the DNA double helix.\n\nB. It is a potent mutagen that causes base-pair substitutions.\n\nC.

A core property of a Poisson random variable $X$ with parameter $\\lambda$ is that $\\mathbb{E}[X]=\\lambda$ and $\\mathrm{Var}(X)=\\lambda$. This equidispersion property provides a principled baseline for assessing whether observed plate-to-plate variation is consistent with a stationary spontaneous mutation process.\n\nYou perform three solvent-control replicates for TA98 and observe revertant counts per plate of $18$, $22$, and $20$.

This is followed by a numerical evaluation of the statistic.\n\nLet the observed counts from the $n$ replicate plates be denoted by the random variables $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n$. The problem states that these are to be treated as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) draws from a Poisson distribution with a common rate parameter $\\lambda$. We write this as $X_i \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$ for $i=1, \\ldots, n$. For this specific problem, we have $n=3$ observations: $x_1 = 18$, $x_2 = 22$, and $x_3 = 20$.\n\nA fundamental property of the Poisson distribution is equidispersion, meaning the variance is equal to the mean: $\\mathrm{Var}(X_i) = \\mathbb{E}[X_i] = \\lambda$. The task is to construct a statistic that tests this property using the observed data.\n\nThe derivation is to be based on the principles of Pearson-type goodness-of-fit statistics. The general form of a Pearson chi-squared statistic is $\\sum \\frac{(\\text{Observed} - \\text{Expected})^2}{\\text{Expected}}$. In our context, for each observation $X_i$, the \"Observed\" value is the count $X_i$ itself. The \"Expected\" value is the theoretical mean of the distribution, $\\mathbb{E}[X_i] = \\lambda$. The denominator, being the variance of the numerator term under the null, would also be $\\lambda$. Thus, if $\\lambda$ were known, a natural statistic would be $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{(X_i - \\lambda)^2}{\\lambda}$.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that the common rate $\\lambda$ is unknown and must be estimated from the data. The standard, and also the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), for the Poisson parameter $\\lambda$ is the sample mean:\n$$\n\\hat{\\lambda} = \\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\n$$\nAccording to large-sample theory for goodness-of-fit tests, when an unknown parameter is replaced by its efficient estimate, the resulting statistic's distribution changes, typically by losing one degree of freedom for each parameter estimated. We substitute $\\hat{\\lambda}$ for $\\lambda$ in our conceptual statistic. This yields the test statistic, which we will call $D$:\n$$\nD = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{(X_i - \\hat{\\lambda})^2}{\\hat{\\lambda}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{(X_i - \\bar{X})^2}{\\bar{X}}\n$$\nThis statistic is known as the Poisson dispersion test statistic, or the index of dispersion. It compares the sum of squared deviations from the estimated mean to the estimated mean itself.\n\nWe can express this statistic in terms of the unbiased sample variance, which is defined as:\n$$\nS^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \\bar{X})^2\n$$\nFrom this definition, the sum of squared deviations is $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \\bar{X})^2 = (n-1)S^2$. Substituting this into the expression for $D$ gives an alternative form:\n$$\nD = \\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\\bar{X}}\n$$\nThis form shows that the statistic is proportional to the ratio of the sample variance to the sample mean, $S^2 / \\bar{X}$. If the data are truly from a Poisson distribution, we expect this ratio to be close to $1$, and thus $D$ to be close to $n-1$. Under the null hypothesis that the data are Poisson distributed, for sufficiently large $n$, the statistic $D$ follows approximately a chi-squared distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom, written $D \\sim \\chi^2_{n-1}$. A value of $D$ significantly larger than $n-1$ suggests overdispersion (variance greater than the mean), while a value significantly smaller suggests underdispersion (variance less than the mean).\n\nNow, we evaluate this statistic for the given data: $x_1 = 18$, $x_2 = 22$, $x_3 = 20$.\nThe sample size is $n=3$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the estimated rate, $\\hat{\\lambda}$, which is the sample mean $\\bar{x}$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\lambda} = \\bar{x} = \\frac{18 + 22 + 20}{3} = \\frac{60}{3} = 20\n$$\nNext, we calculate the sum of squared deviations from the sample mean:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{3} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = (18 - 20)^2 + (22 - 20)^2 + (20 - 20)^2\n$$\n$$\n= (-2)^2 + (2)^2 + (0)^2 = 4 + 4 + 0 = 8\n$$\nNow, we can compute the value of the dispersion statistic $D$:\n$$\nD = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{\\bar{x}} = \\frac{8}{20} = 0.4\n$$\nThe problem requests the numerical value rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nD = 0.4000\n$$\nThis value would be compared to a $\\chi^2$ distribution with $n-1 = 3-1 = 2$ degrees of freedom to formally test the hypothesis of equidispersion.
