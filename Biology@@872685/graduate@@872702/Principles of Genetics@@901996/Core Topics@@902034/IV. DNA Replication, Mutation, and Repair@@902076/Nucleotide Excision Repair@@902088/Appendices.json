The process involves several protein complexes that act in a coordinated sequence. A key player in this pathway is Transcription Factor II H (TFIIH), a large multi-subunit complex. For the NER pathway, the helicase activity of TFIIH is essential for locally unwinding the DNA double helix around the site of damage.\n\nConsider a hypothetical eukaryotic cell line that harbors a specific mutation. This mutation renders the helicase subunits of the TFIIH complex completely non-functional. However, all other proteins involved in the NER pathway, and all other functional domains of the TFIIH complex itself, are normal. If these mutant cells are exposed to UV radiation, thereby inducing pyrimidine dimers, which of the following statements describes the most direct and immediate consequence of the defective TFIIH helicase during the subsequent attempt at NER?\n\nA. The initial recognition of the pyrimidine dimer by the damage-sensing protein complex will fail.\n\nB. The DNA duplex around the lesion will not be unwound, preventing the formation of a stable, open \"repair bubble\".\n\nC. The phosphodiester backbone of the damaged strand will be incised, but the resulting oligonucleotide fragment containing the lesion will fail to be removed.\n\nD. DNA polymerase will successfully fill the gap created by lesion removal, but DNA ligase will be unable to seal the final nick in the repaired strand.\n\nE. The TFIIH complex will be unable to bind to the DNA at the site of the damage.", "solution": "In eukaryotic nucleotide excision repair (NER), the canonical sequence of events is:\n- Damage recognition by XPC-HR23B in global genome repair (or by a stalled RNA polymerase with CSA/CSB in transcription-coupled repair), which recruits TFIIH.\n- Local DNA unwinding by TFIIH, mediated by its helicase subunits (XPB and XPD), to generate an open repair bubble spanning the lesion.\n- Verification and stabilization of the opened region by XPA and RPA.\n- Dual incision of the damaged strand by structure-specific endonucleases: XPF-ERCC1 on the 5-prime side and XPG on the 3-prime side, excising an oligonucleotide containing the lesion.\n- Gap filling by DNA polymerase and sealing by DNA ligase.\n\nGiven the mutation renders the TFIIH helicase subunits non-functional while all other components are intact, the earliest step that directly depends on helicase activity is the local unwinding of DNA. Recognition (XPC/CSA-CSB) and recruitment of TFIIH can still occur through protein-protein interactions despite loss of helicase activity. However, without TFIIH helicase function, the DNA duplex cannot be unwound to form a stable open repair bubble. Without this bubble, RPA/XPA stabilization and the subsequent endonuclease incisions cannot proceed.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because initial damage recognition does not require TFIIH helicase activity.\n- B is correct: the DNA will not be unwound, preventing formation of the repair bubble.\n- C is incorrect because dual incision requires the opened bubble; it would not proceed without unwinding.\n- D is incorrect because polymerase and ligase steps occur only after successful excision; they would not be reached.\n- E is incorrect because TFIIH binding/recruitment can occur independently of its helicase activity; the defect specifically prevents unwinding, not initial binding.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate consequence is failure to unwind the DNA and form the repair bubble.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2327230"}, {"introduction": "DNA damage in a cell is often stochastic, sometimes resulting in multiple lesions in close proximity.

This multi-protein machinery recognizes bulky, helix-distorting lesions and removes a short single-stranded segment containing the damage. The process involves two coordinated endonuclease incisions. For the context of this problem, we will model the key steps as follows: once a lesion is recognized, the XPF-ERCC1 nuclease complex makes an incision 21 nucleotides to the 5' side (upstream) of the damaged base, and the XPG nuclease makes an incision 6 nucleotides to the 3' side (downstream) of the damaged base. The resulting 28-nucleotide fragment is then excised.\n\nConsider a unique and unfortunate scenario within a stretch of DNA where two bulky adducts have formed close to one another on opposite strands.

Because the DNA strands are antiparallel, moving in the 5' direction on the bottom strand corresponds to increasing the top-strand coordinate, and moving in the 3' direction on the bottom strand corresponds to decreasing the top-strand coordinate. Thus, the bottom-strand incisions, mapped onto the top-strand coordinate, are\n$$\n\\text{bottom 5' cut (mapped)} = (N+10) + 21 = N + 31,\n$$\n$$\n\\text{bottom 3' cut (mapped)} = (N+10) - 6 = N + 4.\n$$\nHence, the bottom-strand excised interval (in top-strand coordinates) is\n$$\n[N+4,\\, N+31],\n$$\nwith length\n$$\n(N+31) - (N+4) + 1 = 28.\n$$\n\nNow compare the two excision intervals:\n$$\n\\text{top excision: } [N-21,\\, N+6], \\qquad \\text{bottom excision: } [N+4,\\, N+31].\n$$\nTheir overlap is given by\n$$\n[\\max(N-21,\\, N+4),\\, \\min(N+6,\\, N+31)] = [N+4,\\, N+6],\n$$\nwhich spans\n$$\n(N+6) - (N+4) + 1 = 3\n$$\nnucleotides. Therefore, if the NER machinery initiates and executes the dual incisions concurrently at both lesions, both strands are incised across an overlapping genomic segment, resulting in loss of continuity in both strands over $[N+4,\\, N+6]$.

Global Genomic Nucleotide Excision Repair (GG-NER) surveys the entire genome, while Transcription-Coupled Nucleotide Excision Repair (TC-NER) is initiated when RNA polymerase stalls at a blocking lesion during transcription and preferentially removes lesions from the transcribed strand of active genes. Assume the following minimal, mechanistic model for a single replication cycle within an actively transcribed gene.\n\n- Per base, bulky lesions form independently with probability $p_{\\mathrm{D}}$ in the interval before replication, and any lesion that persists to the replication fork is converted into a mutation with probability $q$.\n- In NER-proficient cells, GG-NER removes any given bulky lesion before replication with probability $p_{\\mathrm{GG}}$, regardless of strand. For a lesion on the transcribed strand, with probability $b$ it is transcription-blocking and thus eligible for TC-NER, which removes it before replication with probability $p_{\\mathrm{TC}}$. If a lesion is not transcription-blocking (probability $1-b$), TC-NER does not act on it. Assume independence of GG-NER and TC-NER such that the probability a lesion escapes both is the product of their escape probabilities when both are eligible to act.\n- In NER-deficient tumors, assume GG-NER is reduced to a residual, slow process with removal probability $p_{\\mathrm{GG}}'$ per lesion before replication, and TC-NER is absent, $p_{\\mathrm{TC}}'=0$; the blocking fraction $b$ is unchanged.\n\nDefine the per-base mutation probabilities per replication cycle on the transcribed strand and the non-transcribed strand as $\\mu_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{NT}}$, respectively.

A mutation occurs if a lesion forms, persists through repair processes, and is then converted into a mutation during replication. Based on the problem statement, these events are independent. Therefore, the mutation probability per base is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$\n\\mu = p_{\\mathrm{D}} \\cdot P(\\text{lesion persists}) \\cdot q\n$$\nwhere $p_{\\mathrm{D}}$ is the probability of lesion formation, $P(\\text{lesion persists})$ is the probability that a formed lesion is not repaired before replication, and $q$ is the probability that a persistent lesion is converted to a mutation. Our task reduces to calculating $P(\\text{lesion persists})$ for the transcribed (T) and non-transcribed (NT) strands in both proficient and deficient cells.\n\nLet us analyze the NER-proficient case first to determine $S_{\\text{proficient}}$.\n\nFor the non-transcribed strand, only Global Genomic NER (GG-NER) is active. The probability of repair by GG-NER is $p_{\\mathrm{GG}}$.

Additionally, if the lesion is transcription-blocking (with probability $b$), it is also subject to Transcription-Coupled NER (TC-NER). We apply the law of total probability to find the persistence probability.\nA lesion on the transcribed strand can be either transcription-blocking or not.\n- With probability $b$, the lesion is blocking. Both GG-NER (removal probability $p_{\\mathrm{GG}}$) and TC-NER (removal probability $p_{\\mathrm{TC}}$) can act.
