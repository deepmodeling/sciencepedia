There is no ambiguity, subjectivity, or reliance on non-scientific claims.\n- **Conclusion:** The problem is self-contained, scientifically valid, and well-posed. No flaws are identified.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe problem requires the design of a selective plating strategy to isolate a specific class of bacterial cells after a conjugation experiment. The strategy must satisfy two criteria:\n1.  **Selection:** It must permit the growth of only those cells that have acquired the desired trait, in this case the $\\mathit{met}^{+}$ allele from the donor.\n2.  **Counter-selection:** It must prevent the growth of the unwanted parental Hfr donor cells.\n\nLet us analyze the genotypes of the cell populations present after mating is interrupted:\n-   **Unmated Hfr Donors:** Hfr, $\\mathit{met}^{+}$, $\\mathit{thr}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{str}^{S}$.\n-   **Unmated F⁻ Recipients:** $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$, $\\mathit{met}^{-}$, $\\mathit{thr}^{-}$, $\\mathrm{str}^{R}$.\n-   **Recombinant F⁻ Exconjugants:** $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$, $\\mathit{met}^{+}$, $\\mathit{thr}^{\\pm}$ (depending on transfer time), $\\mathrm{str}^{R}$. These are the target cells. The $\\mathrm{str}^{R}$ gene is on the recipient chromosome and is not transferred from the Hfr donor. Hence, all exconjugants, being derived from the F⁻ recipient, will be $\\mathrm{str}^{R}$. The problem specifies we are interested in recombinants that inherited at least the $\\mathit{met}^{+}$ allele.\n\nTo satisfy the **selection** criterion (recovering $\\mathit{met}^{+}$ recombinants), one must create an environment where cells with the $\\mathit{met}^{-}$ genotype cannot proliferate. A cell that is auxotrophic for methionine ($\\mathit{met}^{-}$) cannot synthesize this amino acid and requires it to be supplied in the growth medium. Conversely, a prototrophic cell ($\\mathit{met}^{+}$) can synthesize its own methionine. Therefore, plating the mixture on a minimal medium that *lacks* methionine will select for cells with the $\\mathit{met}^{+}$ phenotype. On such a medium, the original $\\mathit{met}^{-}$ recipient cells will fail to grow, while the $\\mathit{met}^{+}$ Hfr donors and the desired $\\mathit{met}^{+}$ exconjugants will be able to grow.\n\nTo satisfy the **counter-selection** criterion (eliminating Hfr donors), one must exploit a differential trait between the donors and the recipients/exconjugants. The donor is streptomycin sensitive ($\\mathrm{str}^{S}$), while the recipient is streptomycin resistant ($\\mathrm{str}^{R}$). Incorporating streptomycin into the plating medium at an inhibitory concentration will kill the $\\mathrm{str}^{S}$ donor cells, while allowing the $\\mathrm{str}^{R}$ recipient and exconjugant cells to survive.\n\nTo achieve both goals simultaneously, the plating medium must combine these two features. It must be a minimal medium that both lacks methionine and contains streptomycin. On such a medium, growth requires a cell to be both prototrophic for methionine ($\\mathit{met}^{+}$) and resistant to streptomycin ($\\mathrm{str}^{R}$).\n-   Original Hfr donors ($\\mathit{met}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{str}^{S}$) are killed by streptomycin.\n-   Original F⁻ recipients ($\\mathit{met}^{-}$, $\\mathrm{str}^{R}$) cannot grow due to the lack of methionine.\n-   Only the recombinant exconjugants ($\\mathit{met}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{str}^{R}$) possess the combination of traits necessary for survival and proliferation.\n\nThis analysis establishes the required composition of the plating medium. Now, we evaluate the provided options.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Plate on minimal medium lacking methionine and containing streptomycin at an inhibitory concentration for $\\mathrm{str}^{S}$ cells.**\n-   The minimal medium lacking methionine selects for the $\\mathit{met}^{+}$ phenotype. This correctly allows growth of the desired recombinants but prevents growth of the non-recombinant F⁻ recipients.\n-   The presence of streptomycin counter-selects against the $\\mathrm{str}^{S}$ Hfr donors, killing them.\n-   The combination of these two conditions permits growth only of cells that are $\\mathit{met}^{+}$ AND $\\mathrm{str}^{R}$, which are precisely the target recombinant exconjugants.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Plate on minimal medium lacking methionine without any antibiotic.**\n-   The minimal medium lacking methionine selects for the $\\mathit{met}^{+}$ phenotype. This allows both Hfr donors and $\\mathit{met}^{+}$ recombinants to grow.\n-   The absence of antibiotic means there is no counter-selection against the Hfr donor cells.\n-   The resulting plate would contain a mixture of Hfr donor colonies and recombinant colonies, failing the secondary objective of eliminating the donors.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Plate on rich medium (e.g., Luria–Bertani) containing streptomycin at an inhibitory concentration for $\\mathrm{str}^{S}$ cells.**\n-   Rich medium contains all amino acids, including methionine. Therefore, it does not select for the $\\mathit{met}^{+}$ phenotype. Both $\\mathit{met}^{-}$ and $\\mathit{met}^{+}$ cells can grow.\n-   The presence of streptomycin will eliminate the Hfr donors.\n-   However, because there is no nutritional selection, the plate would be overgrown with the vast population of non-recombinant F⁻ recipient cells ($\\mathit{met}^{-}$, $\\mathrm{str}^{R}$), making it impossible to isolate the much rarer recombinant colonies. This fails the primary objective.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Plate on minimal medium supplemented with methionine and containing streptomycin at an inhibitory concentration for $\\mathrm{str}^{S}$ cells.**\n-   This medium is functionally equivalent to the rich medium in option C with respect to methionine. By supplementing with methionine, the selection for the $\\mathit{met}^{+}$ allele is nullified. Both $\\mathit{met}^{-}$ and $\\mathit{met}^{+}$ cells can grow.\n-   The presence of streptomycin will eliminate the Hfr donors.\n-   As with option C, the non-recombinant F⁻ recipients ($\\mathit{met}^{-}$, $\\mathrm{str}^{R}$) would survive and proliferate, obscuring any recombinants. This fails the primary objective.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2824256"}, {"introduction": "While a single High-frequency recombination (Hfr) cross reveals the linear order of genes relative to a specific origin, it provides only a partial view of the entire circular chromosome.

The chromosomal map is standardized to a circular scale of $0$ to $100$ minutes measured in the clockwise direction around the chromosome. For a given Hfr donor, the order and time of first appearance of donor markers in recombinants reflect the linear order of markers along the chromosome in the direction of transfer. The transfer direction depends on the orientation of the integrated F sequence: clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) relative to the global clockwise map.\n\nTwo Hfr donors, $Hfr_A$ and $Hfr_B$, were mated with a common recipient and interrupted at defined times.

It provides a self-contained, consistent set of data and clear, objective rules for its interpretation. The premises are factually sound within the context of this genetic model. The problem is well-posed, as the inclusion of multiple shared markers (*azi*, *leu*, *pro*) and the definition of a reference point ($oriT_A$ at $0$) provide sufficient constraints to determine a unique solution. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or missing information. All data points are consistent with a single circular map, as will be demonstrated in the solution.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A formal solution follows.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe core principle is that the time of marker entry, $t$, is equivalent to the distance along the chromosome from the strain's origin of transfer, *oriT*, in the specified direction of transfer. Let $C(X)$ denote the global clockwise coordinate of a marker $X$ on the $0$ to $100$ minute map.\n\n1.  **Establish the Global Map using $Hfr_A$**\n    The origin $oriT_A$ is defined to be at the global coordinate $C(oriT_A) = 0$. $Hfr_A$ transfers its chromosome in the clockwise (CW) direction. Therefore, for any marker transferred by $Hfr_A$, its global clockwise coordinate is simply its time of entry.\n    -   $C(azi) = 12$\n    -   $C(leu) = 18$\n    -   $C(lac) = 43$\n    -   $C(gal) = 55$\n    -   $C(his) = 70$\n    -   $C(pro) = 86$\n\n2.  **Determine the Location of $oriT_B$**\n    The $Hfr_B$ strain transfers in the counterclockwise (CCW) direction. The time of entry for a marker from $Hfr_B$, $t_B$, represents its distance from a yet-unknown origin, $oriT_B$, in the CCW direction. The CCW distance from a point $C_1$ to a point $C_2$ on a $100$-minute circular map is given by $(C_1 - C_2) \\pmod{100}$.\n\n    Therefore, for any marker $X$ transferred by $Hfr_B$, its time of entry $t_{B,X}$ satisfies the relation:\n    $$ (C(oriT_B) - C(X)) \\pmod{100} = t_{B,X} $$\n    We can solve for $C(oriT_B)$ using the shared markers whose global coordinates are known from $Hfr_A$. Let us use the marker *azi*. We have $C(azi) = 12$ and its entry time from $Hfr_B$ is $t_{B,azi} = 28$.\n    $$ (C(oriT_B) - 12) \\pmod{100} = 28 $$\n    $$ C(oriT_B) = (28 + 12) \\pmod{100} $$\n    $$ C(oriT_B) = 40 $$\n    The global coordinate of $oriT_B$ is $40$.\n\n    We must verify this result using the other shared markers to ensure the consistency of the provided data.\n    -   Using marker *leu*: $C(leu) = 18$ and $t_{B,leu} = 22$.\n        $$ (C(oriT_B) - 18) \\pmod{100} = 22 $$\n        $$ C(oriT_B) = (22 + 18) \\pmod{100} = 40 $$\n    -   Using marker *pro*: $C(pro) = 86$ and $t_{B,pro} = 54$.\n        $$ (C(oriT_B) - 86) \\pmod{100} = 54 $$\n        $$ C(oriT_B) = (54 + 86) \\pmod{100} = 140 \\pmod{100} = 40 $$\n    All shared markers yield the same coordinate for $oriT_B$. The data are internally consistent.\n\n3.  **Determine the Global Coordinate of *met***\n    Now that the location of $oriT_B$ is known to be $C(oriT_B) = 40$, we can determine the coordinate of any marker transferred by $Hfr_B$. The problem asks for the coordinate of *met*. The data for $Hfr_B$ states that the entry time for *met* is $t_{B,met} = 33$ minutes.\n    This means the marker *met* is located $33$ minutes CCW from $oriT_B$.\n    Using the same relation:\n    $$ (C(oriT_B) - C(met)) \\pmod{100} = t_{B,met} $$\n    $$ (40 - C(met)) \\pmod{100} = 33 $$\n    This implies $40 - C(met) = 33$, because a coordinate must be in the range $[0, 100)$.\n    $$ C(met) = 40 - 33 $$\n    $$ C(met) = 7 $$\n    The global clockwise coordinate of the marker *met* is $7$ minutes.

The core observations are that genes transferred early recombine successfully, but a specific later gene, $\\mathit{trp}^+$, fails to produce recombinants despite allowing more than sufficient time for its transfer into the recipient.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The scenario is based on established principles of Hfr conjugation and homologous recombination in *Escherichia coli*. The data (gene order, times-of-entry, recombination frequencies) are plausible for such an experiment. The specified gene order may differ from a standard wild-type map, but Hfr strains with various chromosomal rearrangements are common tools in genetics, so this is an acceptable premise.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The data are specific and internally consistent. The failure to recover $\\mathit{trp}^+$ recombinants even after a $60$-minute mating, while a control strain shows normal recombination, clearly points to a defect in the recipient strain $\\mathrm{R}$ that is specific to the $\\mathit{trp}$ region.

It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe central observation is the complete absence of $\\mathit{trp}^+$ recombinants in the recipient strain $\\mathrm{R}$, even under conditions where the donor $\\mathit{trp}^+$ allele has certainly been transferred. The successful recovery of $\\mathit{thr}^+$, $\\mathit{bioA}^+$, and $\\mathit{purE}^+$ recombinants confirms that:\n1.  The Hfr conjugation process is occurring.\n2.  The recipient strain $\\mathrm{R}$ is competent for recombination in general (i.e., it is $\\mathrm{RecA}^+$).\n3.  The issue is localized to the region of the $\\mathit{trp}$ gene.\n\nThe fact that extending the mating time to $60$ minutes does not yield any $\\mathit{trp}^+$ recombinants rules out insufficient transfer time as the cause. The control experiment confirms this. Two principal hypotheses remain:\n1.  **Lethality**: The $\\mathit{trp}^+$ allele or its product is lethal in the genetic background of strain $\\mathrm{R}$.\n2.  **Lack of Homology**: The recipient strain $\\mathrm{R}$ has a genetic alteration, such as a large deletion, in its own $\\mathit{trp}$ region. Homologous recombination requires sequence homology on both sides of the gene to be integrated. A large deletion would remove this homology, preventing the stable incorporation of the incoming donor $\\mathit{trp}^+$ allele. The linear donor DNA fragment, unable to recombine, would be degraded by host nucleases.\n\nWe now evaluate each option based on these deductions.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Infer that $\\mathrm{R}$ carries a large deletion spanning the $\\mathit{trp}$ region... Introduce an F' episome carrying the $\\mathit{trp}$ region...**\n- **Inference**: A large deletion in the recipient's $\\mathit{trp}$ region explains the lack of recombination by eliminating the necessary sequence homology. This is a very strong and direct explanation for the observations.\n- **Proposed Test**: Introduction of an F' episome carrying the $\\mathit{trp}$ region provides a homologous DNA target *in trans*. When the Hfr donor transfers the linear DNA fragment containing $\\mathit{trp}^+$, this fragment can now engage in homologous recombination with the $\\mathit{trp}$ region on the F' episome. Successful recombination would lead to the formation of a $\\mathit{trp}^+$ F' episome, which is heritable. The observation of $\\mathit{trp}^+$ cells (which would also be $\\mathit{thr}^+$ on the chromosome) after this procedure would confirm that the donor DNA is transferrable and recombination-competent, and that the defect was indeed a lack of a homologous target on the recipient's chromosome. This is a classic and elegant genetic test.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**. The inference is the most likely explanation, and the experiment is a well-designed functional test of the hypothesis.\n\n**B. Infer that $\\mathit{trp}$ enters too late in this donor and simply extend the mating time to $120$ minutes...**\n- **Inference**: The issue is one of timing.\n- **Proposed Test**: Extend mating time.\n- **Analysis**: This inference is directly contradicted by the experimental data provided. A mating was conducted for $60$ minutes, which is more than twice the approximate entry time of $\\mathit{trp}$ ($28$ minutes). The control cross under the same conditions yielded $\\mathit{trp}^+$ recombinants. Therefore, the $\\mathit{trp}^+$ allele is being transferred into $\\mathrm{R}$. Extending the mating time further is illogical and will not address the underlying problem, which is a failure of recombination, not transfer.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Infer that the donor’s $\\mathit{trp}^+$ allele is lethal in $\\mathrm{R}$... test this by changing the selection to an earlier marker...**\n- **Inference**: The $\\mathit{trp}^+$ allele is lethal in the recipient. This is a plausible alternative hypothesis.\n- **Proposed Test**: Select for an earlier marker (e.g., $\\mathit{purE}^+$) and see if $\\mathit{trp}^+$ recombinants are recovered.\n- **Analysis**: The proposed test is nonsensical. If the $\\mathit{trp}^+$ genotype is lethal, the cell will die regardless of which other markers it has inherited or which marker was used for primary selection. Selecting for $\\mathit{purE}^+$ instead of $\\mathit{thr}^+$ does not circumvent the lethality of $\\mathit{trp}^+$. Any cell that incorporates $\\mathit{trp}^+$ would still be eliminated from the population. The test does not properly address the hypothesis.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. Although the inference is plausible, the proposed experimental design is critically flawed.\n\n**D. Design a PCR assay using primer $\\mathrm{P_L}$ ... and primer $\\mathrm{P_R}$ ... whereas a deletion encompassing the $\\mathit{trp}$ interval in $\\mathrm{R}$ would shorten the $\\mathrm{P_L}$–$\\mathrm{P_R}$ distance...**\n- **Inference**: This option implicitly tests the deletion hypothesis.\n- **Proposed Test**: A PCR-based physical mapping experiment. The primers $\\mathrm{P_L}$ and $\\mathrm{P_R}$ are designed to flank a large region that includes $\\mathit{thr}$, $\\mathit{trp}$, and $\\mathit{gal}$. In a wild-type chromosome, the distance is too great for amplification ($>60$ kb). However, a large deletion that removes the $\\mathit{trp}$ gene and surrounding DNA would bring the primer binding sites closer, enabling the amplification of a smaller, diagnostic PCR product (e.g., $5$ kb).\n- **Analysis**: This is a direct physical test for a large-scale deletion. If strain $\\mathrm{R}$ yields the predicted shorter amplicon while a wild-type control yields none, it provides strong physical evidence for the deletion. This is a standard and powerful molecular biology technique to confirm chromosomal rearrangements. The logic of the assay design is sound.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**. This is an appropriate and direct physical test for the deletion hypothesis.\n\n**E. Perform generalized transduction using bacteriophage P1 selecting for $\\mathit{thr}^+$ and score cotransduction of $\\mathit{trp}^+$.**\n- **Inference**: This tests for a deletion by checking for genetic linkage.\n- **Proposed Test**: P1 cotransduction of $\\mathit{thr}$ and $\\mathit{trp}$.\n- **Analysis**: The design of this experiment is fundamentally flawed. Generalized transduction with phage P1 can only transfer a small fragment of the bacterial chromosome, approximately $100$ kilobases, which corresponds to about $2$ minutes of the genetic map. The genes $\\mathit{thr}$ (entry at $18$ minutes) and $\\mathit{trp}$ (entry at $28$ minutes) are separated by approximately $10$ minutes on the map. They are far too distant to be cotransduced in a single P1 particle. Therefore, one would not expect to find any $\\mathit{thr}^+ \\mathit{trp}^+$ cotransductants even in a wild-type strain. The absence of such cotransductants in strain $\\mathrm{R}$ would be meaningless and would not provide any evidence for or against a deletion.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The proposed experimental method is not applicable to the genetic distance between the markers in question.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2824338"}]}
