By applying these core definitions and incorporating a statistical treatment of measurement uncertainty, you will develop a deeper appreciation for how phage replication dynamics are quantified.", "problem": "A classic one-step growth experiment is performed with a lytic bacteriophage infecting a homogeneous culture of bacterial hosts under conditions of synchronous infection and immediate adsorption at time zero. The resulting one-step growth curve shows the onset of the rise at time $18$ minutes and a plateau at time $30$ minutes. At the plateau, plaque-forming units (PFU) counted from the culture total $5 \\times 10^{8}$, and the number of infected cells at the outset of the experiment is known exactly to be $10^{7}$. Assume that each infected cell ultimately lyses by the time the plateau is reached.\n\nUsing the foundational definitions that in a one-step growth curve the latent period is the time from infection to the first detectable release of progeny phage, and that the average burst size is the ratio of total infectious progeny to the number of infected cells, and using the well-established property that PFU counts under replicate plating can be modeled as Poisson-distributed random variables, answer the following:\n\n1) Determine the latent period in minutes.\n\n2) Determine the average burst size as a dimensionless quantity.\n\n3) Under the assumption that the PFU count is a single Poisson-distributed observation with mean equal to its variance, and treating the number of infected cells as known without error, estimate the Standard Error (SE) of the burst size estimate.\n\nRound all three requested quantities to three significant figures.

Provide your final answer as an ordered triple in the form $\\left(\\text{latent period}, \\text{burst size}, \\text{SE of burst size}\\right)$.", "solution": "The problem statement has been examined and is found to be scientifically valid, self-contained, and well-posed. It presents a standard problem in quantitative virology based on the classical one-step growth experiment. All necessary definitions, data, and assumptions are provided and are internally consistent. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of three quantities: the latent period, the average burst size, and the standard error of the burst size estimate.\n\n1) Determination of the Latent Period\nThe problem defines the latent period as \"the time from infection to the first detectable release of progeny phage\". In the context of a one-step growth curve, this period begins at the time of infection, which is given as time zero ($t=0$), and ends at the \"onset of the rise\" of the phage titer. The problem explicitly states that the onset of the rise occurs at $18$ minutes. Therefore, the latent period, which we shall denote as $L_p$, is directly given by this value.\n\n$$L_p = 18 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\nRounding to three significant figures, we express this as $18.0$ minutes.\n\n2) Determination of the Average Burst Size\nThe problem defines the average burst size ($BS$) as \"the ratio of total infectious progeny to the number of infected cells\". The total infectious progeny is the final yield of phage particles, which is measured by the plaque-forming units (PFU) at the plateau of the growth curve. The number of infected cells is the initial count of bacteria that were successfully infected.\n\nLet $N_{PFU}$ be the total PFU count at the plateau and $N_{cells}$ be the initial number of infected cells. The given values are:\n$$N_{PFU} = 5 \\times 10^{8}$$\n$$N_{cells} = 10^{7}$$\n\nThe average burst size is then calculated as:\n$$BS = \\frac{N_{PFU}}{N_{cells}} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{8}}{10^{7}} = 5 \\times 10^{(8-7)} = 5 \\times 10^{1} = 50$$\n\nThis is a dimensionless quantity representing the average number of phages produced per lysed cell. Rounding to three significant figures, the burst size is $50.0$.\n\n3) Estimation of the Standard Error (SE) of the Burst Size\nThe burst size, $BS$, is an estimate calculated from experimental data. We must now quantify the statistical uncertainty of this estimate. The burst size is a function of two quantities: the PFU count, which we will denote as a random variable $Y$, and the number of infected cells, $N$.\n\n$$BS = \\frac{Y}{N}$$\n\nThe problem states that the PFU count $Y$ can be modeled as a Poisson-distributed random variable. A fundamental property of a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$ is that its variance is also equal to its mean:\n$$Y \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$$\n$$E[Y] = \\lambda$$\n$$Var(Y) = \\lambda$$\n\nThe observed PFU count, $Y_{obs} = N_{PFU} = 5 \\times 10^{8}$, is our single best estimate for the mean $\\lambda$. Therefore, the best estimate for the variance of the PFU count is the count itself:\n$$\\widehat{Var}(Y) = Y_{obs} = 5 \\times 10^{8}$$\n\nThe problem also specifies that the number of infected cells, $N = N_{cells} = 10^{7}$, is known \"without error\", meaning it is treated as a deterministic constant, not a random variable.\n\nWe use the principle of propagation of uncertainty to find the variance of the burst size estimate, $Var(BS)$. For a function $f(X) = aX$, where $a$ is a constant, the variance is $Var(aX) = a^2 Var(X)$. In our case, $BS = \\frac{1}{N} \\cdot Y$, so the constant is $a = \\frac{1}{N}$.\n$$Var(BS) = Var\\left(\\frac{1}{N} Y\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right)^2 Var(Y) = \\frac{Var(Y)}{N^2}$$\n\nThe Standard Error ($SE$) of the burst size estimate is the standard deviation of its sampling distribution, which is the square root of its variance:\n$$SE(BS) = \\sqrt{Var(BS)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{Var(Y)}{N^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{Var(Y)}}{N}$$\n\nSubstituting our estimated variance for $Y$:\n$$\\widehat{SE}(BS) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\widehat{Var}(Y)}}{N} = \\frac{\\sqrt{Y_{obs}}}{N}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$\\widehat{SE}(BS) = \\frac{\\sqrt{5 \\times 10^{8}}}{10^{7}}$$\n\nTo compute this, we simplify the expression:\n$$\\widehat{SE}(BS) = \\frac{\\sqrt{5} \\times \\sqrt{10^{8}}}{10^{7}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5} \\times 10^{4}}{10^{7}} = \\sqrt{5} \\times 10^{(4-7)} = \\sqrt{5} \\times 10^{-3}$$\n\nUsing the numerical value $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.2360679...$:\n$$\\widehat{SE}(BS) \\approx 2.2360679 \\times 10^{-3} \\approx 0.0022360679$$\n\nRounding this result to three significant figures, we look at the first three non-zero digits ($2$, $2$, $3$) and the fourth digit ($6$). Since the fourth digit is $5$ or greater, we round up the third digit.\n$$\\widehat{SE}(BS) \\approx 0.00224$$\n\nThe three requested quantities, rounded to three significant figures, are:\n- Latent period: $18.0$ minutes\n- Average burst size: $50.0$\n- Standard Error of burst size: $0.00224$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 18.0 & 50.0 & 0.00224 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2791855"}, {"introduction": "Bacteriophages not only replicate but can also serve as powerful tools for bacterial genetics by mediating horizontal gene transfer through transduction.

The system is governed by a thermodynamic model of transcriptional regulation at the promoter for repressor maintenance, $P_{RM}$. We begin by formalizing the statistical mechanics of the system.\n\nThe state of the promoter region is determined by the binding of CI dimers to the operator sites $OR2$ and $OR3$, and the binding of RNA polymerase (RNAP) to the promoter $P_{RM}$. We define the statistical weight of the reference state, where all sites are unoccupied, as $1$.
