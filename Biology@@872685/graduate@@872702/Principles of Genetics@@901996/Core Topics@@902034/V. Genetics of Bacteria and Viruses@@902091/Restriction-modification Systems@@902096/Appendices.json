The EcoRI restriction endonuclease from Escherichia coli recognizes the palindromic sequence 5′-GAATTC-3′ and cleaves unmethylated DNA at that site in vitro. Consider a covalently closed circular plasmid DNA of total length $3$ kilobase pairs (kb) that contains exactly two EcoRI recognition sites. Along the circular genetic map, the shortest arc distance between these two sites is $1$ kb, and the longer arc completes the circle.

Do not include units in your final boxed answer; all sizes are to be interpreted in kb.", "solution": "The problem is first subjected to rigorous validation before any attempt at a solution.\n\nStep 1: Extract Givens.\nThe explicit information provided in the problem statement is as follows:\n- DNA molecule: A covalently closed circular plasmid.\n- Total length of plasmid: $L_{total} = 3$ kilobase pairs (kb).\n- Restriction endonuclease: EcoRI, which recognizes the sequence 5′-GAATTC-3′.\n- Number of EcoRI recognition sites: $N = 2$.\n- Arrangement of sites: The shortest arc distance between the two sites on the circular map is $d_{short} = 1$ kb.\n- Plasmid preparation: The plasmid is unmethylated.\n- Digestion condition: The plasmid is digested to completion, meaning every recognition site is cleaved.\n- Objective: Derive the sizes of all linear restriction fragments produced.\n- Output format: A row vector of fragment sizes in kilobase pairs (kb), ordered from smallest to largest.\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens.\nThe problem is evaluated against the required criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a standard, fundamental procedure in molecular biology: the restriction digest of a plasmid DNA. The concepts of circular plasmids, restriction endonucleases (specifically EcoRI), recognition sites, methylation, and complete digestion are well-established and factually correct. The specified lengths are physically plausible. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is unambiguous and provides all necessary information for a unique solution. The total length of the circular DNA and the distance between the two cut sites are given. The term \"complete digestion\" has a precise technical meaning.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from any subjective or non-scientific content.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. The given data are consistent; the total length of the circle ($3$ kb) is composed of two arcs, one of which is specified ($1$ kb), implying the other must be $3-1 = 2$ kb. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nStep 3: Solution Derivation.\nThe core principle is that the cleavage of a DNA molecule by a restriction endonuclease at its recognition sites generates a set of smaller, linear DNA fragments. The number of fragments produced depends on the topology of the initial DNA molecule (linear or circular) and the number of recognition sites.\n\nFor a covalently closed circular DNA molecule with $N$ distinct recognition sites, a complete digestion (cleavage at every site) will result in exactly $N$ linear fragments.\nIn this problem, the plasmid is circular and has $N=2$ EcoRI recognition sites. Therefore, complete digestion will yield $2$ linear fragments.\n\nThe lengths of these two fragments are determined by the lengths of the two arcs of DNA connecting the two restriction sites on the circular plasmid. Let the total length of the circular plasmid be $L_{total}$. The plasmid is partitioned into two arcs by the two EcoRI sites.\n\nThe length of the shorter arc is given as $d_{1} = 1$ kb.\nThe length of the longer arc, $d_{2}$, must be the remainder of the total circular length. This is calculated as:\n$$d_{2} = L_{total} - d_{1}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$L_{total} = 3 \\text{ kb}$$\n$$d_{1} = 1 \\text{ kb}$$\nThus, the length of the second fragment is:\n$$d_{2} = 3 \\text{ kb} - 1 \\text{ kb} = 2 \\text{ kb}$$\n\nUpon complete digestion, the circular plasmid is cut at both sites, releasing the two arcs as two distinct linear molecules. The sizes of these linear fragments are therefore $d_{1} = 1$ kb and $d_{2} = 2$ kb.\n\nAs a necessary check for conservation of material, the sum of the lengths of the resulting fragments must equal the total length of the original plasmid:\n$$d_{1} + d_{2} = 1 \\text{ kb} + 2 \\text{ kb} = 3 \\text{ kb}$$\nThis sum is indeed equal to $L_{total}$, which confirms the correctness of the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be presented as a row vector of the fragment sizes, ordered from smallest to largest. The calculated fragment sizes are $1$ kb and $2$ kb. Ordered from smallest to largest, they are $1$ and $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2529955"}, {"introduction": "Restriction enzymes do not act in a vacuum; they are part of a sophisticated defense system that must distinguish the bacterium's own DNA from foreign DNA. This next practice [@problem_id:2846351] explores the 'modification' half of the restriction-modification system, focusing on how DNA methylation protects host DNA. You will integrate mechanistic details of enzyme-DNA interaction with experimental outcomes to understand how methylation patterns dictate whether a recognition site is cleaved or protected.", "problem": "A bacterium carries a restriction–modification system in which a Type II restriction endonuclease (R.Enz) and its cognate DNA methyltransferase (M.Enz) act on the same palindromic recognition site. The recognition sequence is a symmetric hexamer, and M.Enz adds a single methyl group per strand to a specific base within each half-site, projecting into the major groove. Biochemical measurements show that R.Enz functions as a homodimer that engages both half-sites simultaneously. Cleavage is concerted and requires formation of a dimer–DNA complex in which both monomers make base-specific hydrogen-bond contacts across the major groove; single-strand nicking by a monomer bound to only one half-site is negligible under the reaction conditions used here. Additional binding experiments demonstrate that methylation on either strand within the recognition site abolishes high-affinity binding by disrupting at least one essential base-specific contact per half-site.\n\nA circular plasmid of length $6000$ base pairs contains exactly $3$ R.Enz recognition sites that subdivide the plasmid into segments of $1000$, $2000$, and $3000$ base pairs when all sites are cleaved. Three preparations of this plasmid are available: (i) fully methylated at all three sites on both strands (as produced by M.Enz in vivo long after replication), (ii) hemimethylated at all three sites (as present immediately after replication, with the parental strand methylated and the nascent strand unmethylated), and (iii) completely unmethylated at all three sites (as isolated from a methyltransferase-null background). Each preparation is incubated with excess R.Enz under conditions that drive complete cleavage of any site that is kinetically competent to be cut.\n\nBased on the core definitions that Type II restriction endonucleases achieve sequence specificity through base-specific contacts in the major groove and that methylation alters the pattern of hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors and introduces steric bulk into the major groove, choose the single option that best integrates a mechanistic explanation of how methylation blocks cleavage with the correct prediction of digestion patterns for the fully methylated, hemimethylated, and unmethylated plasmid substrates.\n\nA. Mechanism: The methyl group in the major groove occludes and/or removes a critical hydrogen-bonding contact required for one monomer of the dimer to recognize its half-site, preventing assembly of the active dimer–DNA complex; methylation on either strand therefore blocks cleavage. Pattern: Fully methylated and hemimethylated plasmids resist cleavage and remain intact circles, whereas the unmethylated plasmid is completely digested into $3$ fragments of $1000$, $2000$, and $3000$ base pairs.\n\nB. Mechanism: Methylation weakens catalysis but not binding; one monomer can still cleave its strand even if the opposite half-site is methylated. Pattern: Fully methylated plasmid accumulates nicked open-circular molecules; hemimethylated plasmid becomes linearized at one site; unmethylated plasmid is digested into $3$ fragments of $1000$, $2000$, and $3000$ base pairs.\n\nC. Mechanism: Each monomer recognizes only its half-site independently and cleaves its corresponding strand regardless of methylation on the opposite strand. Pattern: Hemimethylated plasmid is digested to the same $3$-fragment pattern ($1000$, $2000$, $3000$ base pairs) as the unmethylated plasmid; fully methylated plasmid is partially protected but still yields some of these fragments.\n\nD. Mechanism: Methyl groups create hydrophobic patches that recruit R.Enz and stabilize the dimer–DNA complex. Pattern: Fully methylated plasmid is hyper-susceptible and is over-digested into fragments smaller than $1000$ base pairs; hemimethylated plasmid shows intermediate digestion; unmethylated plasmid shows minimal cleavage.", "solution": "The problem statement will be validated before a solution is attempted.\n\nFirst, the givens are extracted from the problem statement:\n1.  The system is a Type II restriction–modification system in a bacterium, consisting of a restriction endonuclease ($R.Enz$) and a DNA methyltransferase ($M.Enz$).\n2.  Both enzymes act on the same palindromic, symmetric hexamer recognition sequence.\n3.  $M.Enz$ adds one methyl group per strand to a base within each half-site, projecting into the major groove.\n4.  $R.Enz$ is a homodimer that binds both half-sites simultaneously.\n5.  $R.Enz$ cleavage is concerted and requires the formation of a dimer–DNA complex where both monomers make base-specific hydrogen-bond contacts.\n6.  Single-strand nicking by a monomer is negligible.\n7.  Methylation on either strand abolishes high-affinity binding by disrupting essential base-specific contacts.\n8.  The substrate is a circular plasmid of length $6000$ base pairs ($bp$).\n9.  The plasmid contains exactly $3$ $R.Enz$ recognition sites. Complete cleavage yields fragments of $1000$ $bp$, $2000$ $bp$, and $3000$ $bp$.\n10. Three plasmid preparations exist: (i) fully methylated (both strands at all sites), (ii) hemimethylated (one strand at all sites), and (iii) unmethylated (no methylation).\n11. The experiment is run with excess $R.Enz$ under conditions for complete digestion of any cleavable site.\n12. The core principle for analysis is that sequence specificity is via major groove contacts, which are altered by methylation (hydrogen bonding, steric hindrance).\n\nNext, the problem statement is validated against the required criteria.\n1.  **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is scientifically sound. It accurately describes the fundamental principles of Type II restriction-modification systems, including the homodimeric nature of many restriction enzymes, recognition of palindromic sequences, the role of major groove contacts for specificity, and the mechanism of protection by methylation. The concepts of fully methylated, hemimethylated, and unmethylated DNA are central to molecular biology.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear, self-contained set of rules governing the interaction between the enzyme and its substrate in different methylation states. The physical parameters of the plasmid ($6000$ $bp$ length, $3$ sites, fragment sizes of $1000$, $2000$, $3000$ $bp$) are consistent ($1000 + 2000 + 3000 = 6000$). The question asks for a logical deduction based on the provided information, for which a unique solution exists.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and unbiased scientific language.\n\nThe problem statement has no scientific, logical, or structural flaws. It is a valid problem. We may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe solution requires determining the action of $R.Enz$ on each of the three plasmid preparations based on the provided mechanistic rules. The central premise is that $R.Enz$ binding and subsequent cleavage are contingent on the formation of a specific dimer-DNA complex, which is disrupted by methylation.\n\nThe problem states: \"methylation on *either* strand within the recognition site abolishes high-affinity binding by disrupting at least one essential base-specific contact per half-site.\" This is the key rule. Because binding is abolished, the active dimer-DNA complex required for concerted cleavage cannot form. The explicit statement that \"single-strand nicking... is negligible\" further simplifies the outcome: if a site cannot be cleaved concertedly, it will not be nicked either. It will remain intact.\n\nLet us analyze the three substrates:\n1.  **Unmethylated plasmid:** This plasmid contains three recognition sites, none of which are methylated. There is nothing to inhibit the binding of the $R.Enz$ homodimer. Given excess enzyme and optimal conditions, the enzyme will bind and concertedly cleave all three sites. The cleavage of three sites on a circular molecule will produce three linear fragments. The sizes are given as $1000$ $bp$, $2000$ $bp$, and $3000$ $bp$. This outcome is certain.\n\n2.  **Fully methylated plasmid:** In this preparation, all three sites have methyl groups on both strands. According to the rule, methylation on either strand abolishes binding. Since both strands are methylated, binding is unequivocally abolished at all three sites. Therefore, no cleavage will occur. The plasmid will remain an intact $6000$ $bp$ circular molecule.\n\n3.  **Hemimethylated plasmid:** Here, each of the three recognition sites is methylated on only one strand. The rule is explicit: \"methylation on *either* strand... abolishes high-affinity binding\". The presence of a methyl group on just one strand is sufficient to prevent the formation of the active enzyme-DNA complex. Consequently, $R.Enz$ cannot cleave these hemimethylated sites. All three sites are protected, and the plasmid will remain an intact $6000$ $bp$ circular molecule.\n\nTo summarize the predicted digestion patterns:\n-   Unmethylated: Complete digestion into $3$ fragments ($1000$, $2000$, $3000$ $bp$).\n-   Hemimethylated: No digestion (intact $6000$ $bp$ circle).\n-   Fully methylated: No digestion (intact $6000$ $bp$ circle).\n\nNow, each option is evaluated.\n\n**A. Mechanism: The methyl group in the major groove occludes and/or removes a critical hydrogen-bonding contact required for one monomer of the dimer to recognize its half-site, preventing assembly of the active dimer–DNA complex; methylation on either strand therefore blocks cleavage. Pattern: Fully methylated and hemimethylated plasmids resist cleavage and remain intact circles, whereas the unmethylated plasmid is completely digested into $3$ fragments of $1000$, $2000$, and $3000$ base pairs.**\n-   The mechanism described is a precise restatement of the principles given in the problem: methylation interferes with major groove contacts, preventing binding of the dimer, thus blocking cleavage. It correctly concludes that methylation on either strand is sufficient for blockage.\n-   The predicted pattern matches our derivation perfectly: both fully methylated and hemimethylated plasmids are protected and remain circular, while the unmethylated plasmid is fully digested into the three expected fragments.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Mechanism: Methylation weakens catalysis but not binding; one monomer can still cleave its strand even if the opposite half-site is methylated. Pattern: Fully methylated plasmid accumulates nicked open-circular molecules; hemimethylated plasmid becomes linearized at one site; unmethylated plasmid is digested into $3$ fragments of $1000$, $2000$, and $3000$ base pairs.**\n-   The mechanism is incorrect. It claims methylation does not affect binding, which directly contradicts the problem statement that methylation \"abolishes high-affinity binding\". It also posits significant single-strand cleavage (nicking), which contradicts the statement that nicking is \"negligible\".\n-   The pattern is also incorrect and inconsistent with the problem's premises. Linearization of the hemimethylated plasmid is impossible if binding is abolished.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Mechanism: Each monomer recognizes only its half-site independently and cleaves its corresponding strand regardless of methylation on the opposite strand. Pattern: Hemimethylated plasmid is digested to the same $3$-fragment pattern ($1000$, $2000$, $3000$ base pairs) as the unmethylated plasmid; fully methylated plasmid is partially protected but still yields some of these fragments.**\n-   The mechanism is incorrect. It assumes independent monomer action, which is falsified by the problem's description of a homodimer that \"engages both half-sites simultaneously\" and performs \"concerted\" cleavage.\n-   The pattern is incorrect. It predicts that hemimethylated DNA is cleaved, which would require the enzyme to bind to a site containing a methyl group, an action explicitly prohibited by the rules given.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Mechanism: Methyl groups create hydrophobic patches that recruit R.Enz and stabilize the dimer–DNA complex. Pattern: Fully methylated plasmid is hyper-susceptible and is over-digested into fragments smaller than $1000$ base pairs; hemimethylated plasmid shows intermediate digestion; unmethylated plasmid shows minimal cleavage.**\n-   The mechanism is the antithesis of what is stated. It claims methylation *stabilizes* the enzyme-DNA complex, whereas the problem states it *abolishes* binding. This is a fundamental misreading.\n-   The pattern is consequentially inverted from the correct prediction. It suggests methylated DNA is the preferred substrate, which is biologically incorrect for a restriction-modification system designed for self-preservation.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nOnly option A provides both a mechanism and a predicted pattern that are fully consistent with all information given in the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2846351"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the scale of a single plasmid to an entire genome requires a shift from deterministic calculation to statistical estimation.

It presents a standard problem in statistical genomics that can be solved using fundamental principles of probability theory. All provided assumptions are standard for such a model and permit a rigorous derivation. We proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for the expected number of recognition sites. Let $G$ be the length of the circular chromosome in base pairs and $r$ be the length of the specific recognition motif. The problem states that the DNA sequence has a uniform base composition, with each of the four bases $\\{ \\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{G}, \\mathrm{T} \\}$ occurring with a probability of $p_{base} = \\frac{1}{4}$. It is also assumed that the bases at different positions are independent.\n\nA specific recognition motif is a sequence of $r$ defined bases. Due to the independence of bases, the probability $p$ that a sequence of length $r$ starting at any given position matches the specific recognition motif is the product of the probabilities of each base in the motif.\n$$p = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^r = 4^{-r}$$\nTo find the expected number of recognition sites, $E[N]$, we define a set of indicator random variables. Let $X_i$ be an indicator variable for the event that a recognition site starts at position $i$ on the chromosome, for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, G$. Since the chromosome is circular, there are $G$ distinct possible starting positions.\nThe indicator variable $X_i$ is defined as:\n$$\nX_i = \n\\begin{cases} \n1 & \\text{if a recognition site starts at position } i \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise} \n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe expected value of an indicator variable is the probability of the event it indicates. Therefore, for any position $i$:\n$$E[X_i] = P(X_i = 1) = p = 4^{-r}$$\nThe total number of recognition sites, $N$, is the sum of these indicator variables over all possible starting positions:\n$$N = \\sum_{i=1}^{G} X_i$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected total number of sites is the sum of the individual expected values, regardless of whether the variables $X_i$ are independent.\n$$E[N] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{G} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{G} E[X_i]$$\nSince $E[X_i]$ is the same for all positions $i$, we have:\n$$E[N] = \\sum_{i=1}^{G} 4^{-r} = G \\cdot 4^{-r}$$\nThis is the general expression for the expected number of recognition sites.\n\nNext, we derive the general expression for the expected mean fragment length. The problem states that for the complete digestion of a circular chromosome, the number of resulting DNA fragments is equal to the number of recognition sites, $N$. The total length of the chromosome is $G$. The mean length of the fragments for a given digestion is therefore $\\frac{G}{N}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the *expected* mean fragment length. In this context, this is standardly interpreted as the total length of the genome divided by the *expected* number of sites. This interpretation is supported by the problem's hint to consider the mean waiting time for a geometric process. The occurrence of a site at any position can be modeled as a Bernoulli trial with success probability $p = 4^{-r}$. The expected distance between successive sites, which corresponds to the expected fragment length, is the mean of the corresponding geometric distribution, which is $\\frac{1}{p}$.\nLet $L_{mean}$ be the expected mean fragment length.\n$$L_{mean} = \\frac{G}{E[N]}$$\nSubstituting the previously derived expression for $E[N]$:\n$$L_{mean} = \\frac{G}{G \\cdot 4^{-r}} = \\frac{1}{4^{-r}} = 4^r$$\nThis is the general expression for the expected mean fragment length, measured in base pairs.\n\nFinally, we evaluate these two expressions numerically for the given values $G = 5.16096 \\times 10^{6}$ and $r = 6$.\n\nThe expected number of recognition sites is:\n$$E[N] = (5.16096 \\times 10^{6}) \\cdot 4^{-6} = \\frac{5160960}{4096} = 1260$$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to four significant figures. The number $1260$ can be written as $1.260 \\times 10^3$, which has four significant figures.\n\nThe expected mean fragment length is:\n$$L_{mean} = 4^r = 4^6 = 4096 \\text{ base pairs}$$\nThis result, $4096$, can be written as $4.096 \\times 10^3$, which already has four significant figures.\n\nThe two numerical results are $1260$ for the expected number of sites and $4096$ for the expected mean fragment length in base pairs.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1260 & 4096 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2529972"}]}
