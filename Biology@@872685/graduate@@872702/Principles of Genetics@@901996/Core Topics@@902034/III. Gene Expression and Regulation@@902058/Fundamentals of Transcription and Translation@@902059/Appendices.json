The Central Dogma of molecular biology states that genetic information flows from deoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid to protein, with translation occurring on the ribosome by codon–anticodon pairing between messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) codons and tRNA anticodons. In the ribosomal decoding center, the first two positions of the codon (from the mRNA $5'$ end) are constrained to adopt Watson–Crick geometry, whereas the third codon position (paired to the $5'$ nucleotide of the anticodon) tolerates noncanonical “wobble” base pairing. Standard Watson–Crick pairing is adenine–uracil and guanine–cytosine.\n\nUsing only these foundational facts and the known hydrogen-bonding capabilities of uracil, guanine, cytosine, adenine, and inosine in the ribosomal decoding context, perform the following:\n\n1. Derive, from first principles of base-pair geometry under ribosomal constraints, the mapping that associates each possible base at the $5'$ end of the anticodon to the set of permissible bases it can pair with at the $3'$ end of the codon under standard wobble interactions.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established principles of molecular biology, specifically the mechanisms of genetic decoding at the ribosome. The premises are factually correct, the terminology is precise, and the tasks are structured to lead to a unique and verifiable solution. It requires a rigorous application of chemical and geometric principles to a biological context. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a formal solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem is partitioned into three tasks. We shall address them in sequence, building the solution from first principles as required.\n\nFirst, we must derive the mapping for wobble pairing. The foundation of this phenomenon lies in the three-dimensional structure of the ribosomal A-site, where codon–anticodon recognition occurs. For the first two positions of the messenger RNA (mRNA) codon, corresponding to the third and second positions of the transfer RNA (tRNA) anticodon respectively, the ribosome enforces a strict geometric constraint. Specifically, atoms of the $16$S ribosomal RNA (in prokaryotes, or its eukaryotic homologue) monitor the minor groove of the nascent codon–anticodon duplex. A canonical Watson–Crick base pair—that is, Guanine–Cytosine ($G-C$) or Adenine–Uracil ($A-U$)—presents a specific and predictable pattern of hydrogen bond acceptors in the minor groove. Any deviation, such as a purine–purine or pyrimidine–pyrimidine pair, results in a distorted duplex geometry that is sterically rejected by the ribosome's decoding center. This mechanism ensures extremely high fidelity for the first two bases of the codon, which are the primary determinants of amino acid identity.\n\nIn contrast, the third position of the codon, which pairs with the first position of the anticodon (the so-called \"wobble\" position, at the $5'$ end of the anticodon), is not subject to the same stringent geometric proofreading. The conformational constraints are relaxed at this locus, allowing for a certain degree of \"wobble\" or spatial adjustment. This permits the formation of non-canonical base pairs, provided they can achieve a stable hydrogen-bonded structure without grossly perturbing the overall helical geometry. We will now analyze the possible pairings for each base at the anticodon's $5'$ position.\n\n1.  Anticodon $G$: Pairs with codon $C$ via the canonical $3$ hydrogen bonds. It can also form a stable \"wobble\" pair with codon $U$. The $G-U$ pair has $2$ hydrogen bonds and a geometry that is accommodated by the ribosome. Thus, anticodon $G$ maps to codon $C$ and $U$.\n\n2.  Anticodon $C$: Pairs only with codon $G$ via $3$ hydrogen bonds. Other potential pairings are sterically disfavored in the ribosomal context. Thus, anticodon $C$ maps to codon $G$.\n\n3.  Anticodon $A$: Pairs with codon $U$ via the canonical $2$ hydrogen bonds. In many biological systems, anticodon $A$ is enzymatically modified to Inosine ($I$) to prevent potential mispairing and expand decoding capacity. Assuming an unmodified $A$, it pairs strictly with $U$.\n\n4.  Anticodon $U$: Pairs with codon $A$ via $2$ hydrogen bonds. It also forms a stable wobble pair with codon $G$, identical in nature to the $G-U$ pair. Thus, anticodon $U$ maps to codon $A$ and $G$.\n\n5.  Anticodon $I$ (Inosine): Inosine's structure is that of a purine, identical to guanine but lacking the exocyclic amino group at position $2$. Its hydrogen bonding potential at the wobble position is versatile.\n    -   With codon $C$: An $I-C$ pair can form with $2$ hydrogen bonds, creating a geometry that mimics a standard Watson–Crick pair.\n    -   With codon $A$: An $I-A$ pair can form with $2$ hydrogen bonds. Although this is a purine-purine pair, its geometry is acceptable within the relaxed constraints of the wobble position.\n    -   With codon $U$: An $I-U$ pair can form with $2$ hydrogen bonds, also sterically permissible.\n    -   With codon $G$: An $I-G$ pair is not formed due to steric clashes and unfavorable alignment of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors.\n    Thus, anticodon $I$ maps to codon $C$, $A$, and $U$.\n\nIn summary, the wobble mapping from the $5'$-base of the anticodon to the $3'$-base of the codon is:\n-   $G \\rightarrow \\{C, U\\}$\n-   $C \\rightarrow \\{G\\}$\n-   $A \\rightarrow \\{U\\}$\n-   $U \\rightarrow \\{A, G\\}$\n-   $I \\rightarrow \\{C, A, U\\}$\n\nSecond, we apply these rules to the specific tRNA with the anticodon written $5'$-IAU-$3'$. The pairing between the codon and anticodon is antiparallel. Let the corresponding mRNA codon be written $5'$-N$_1$N$_2$N$_3$-$3'$, where N$_1$ is the $5'$-most base. The pairing alignment is:\n\nmRNA Codon:   `$5' - N_1 - N_2 - N_3 - 3'$`\ntRNA Anticodon: `$3' - U  - A  - I  - 5'$`\n\nWe determine the identities of the bases $N_1$, $N_2$, and $N_3$ by using standard 5'-to-3' numbering for positions within each molecule:\n\n-   **Codon position 1 ($N_1$)**: Pairs with anticodon position 3 (U). This is a standard Watson–Crick position. U pairs with A. Therefore, $N_1 = A$.\n\n-   **Codon position 2 ($N_2$)**: Pairs with anticodon position 2 (A). This is also a standard Watson–Crick position. A pairs with U. Therefore, $N_2 = U$.\n\n-   **Codon position 3 ($N_3$)**: Pairs with anticodon position 1 (I), the \"wobble\" position. From our derivation above, I can pair with C, A, or U. Therefore, $N_3 \\in \\{C, A, U\\}$.\n\nThe mRNA codons are read in the $5' \\to 3'$ direction, which corresponds to the sequence $N_1N_2N_3$. Substituting the bases we have determined:\n-   $N_1 = A$\n-   $N_2 = U$\n-   $N_3$ can be $U$, $C$, or $A$.\n\nThis yields the complete set of codons that can be decoded by this tRNA:\n1.  $5'$-AUU-$3'$\n2.  $5'$-AUC-$3'$\n3.  $5'$-AUA-$3'$\n\nThird, we report the number of distinct codons found. Based on the analysis in the preceding step, there are three unique mRNA codons that the tRNA with anticodon $5'$-IAU-$3'$ can recognize and decode.
