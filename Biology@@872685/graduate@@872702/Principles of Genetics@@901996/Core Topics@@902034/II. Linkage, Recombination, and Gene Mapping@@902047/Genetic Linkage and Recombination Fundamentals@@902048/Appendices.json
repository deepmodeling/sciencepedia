It is scientifically grounded in the principles of genetic linkage analysis, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language. We will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental quantities are the recombination fraction, $r$, and the map distance, $d$. The recombination fraction $r$ is an observable quantity, defined as the proportion of recombinant offspring resulting from a cross. The map distance $d$, measured in Morgans, is a theoretical construct defined as the expected number of crossover events occurring in a chromosomal interval per meiosis. One Morgan corresponds to an average of one crossover per meiosis. A centiMorgan (cM) is $\\frac{1}{100}$ of a Morgan.\n\nThe problem provides an observed recombination fraction $r = 0.18$. We must estimate the map distance using two different models.\n\nFirst, we use the linear small-distance approximation. This model is valid only for very small values of $r$. It operates on the simplifying assumption that the probability of more than one crossover event within the interval is negligible. If at most one crossover can occur, then every crossover event results in recombinant gametes. In this case, the frequency of recombinant gametes ($r$) is equal to the frequency of crossover events ($d$).\nThus, the linear approximation is:\n$$d_{linear} \\approx r$$\nGiven $r = 0.18$, the map distance in Morgans is:\n$$d_{linear} = 0.18 \\text{ Morgans}$$\nTo express this in centiMorgans, we multiply by $100$:\n$$d_{linear, cM} = 0.18 \\times 100 = 18.00 \\text{ cM}$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $18.00$ cM.\n\nSecond, we use the Haldane mapping function. This model assumes that crossovers are distributed along the chromosome according to a Poisson process, with a mean of $d$. This is a model of no crossover interference, meaning a crossover at one point does not affect the probability of another crossover nearby. Under the Poisson model, the probability of exactly $k$ crossovers occurring in the interval is given by:\n$$P(X=k) = \\frac{\\exp(-d)d^k}{k!}$$\nRecombination between two loci is observed only if an odd number of crossovers ($k=1, 3, 5, ...$) occurs between them. An even number of crossovers ($k=0, 2, 4, ...$) restores the parental linkage phase and thus produces non-recombinant gametes. The recombination fraction $r$ is therefore the sum of probabilities of all odd numbers of crossovers:\n$$r = \\sum_{k \\text{ odd}} P(X=k) = P(X=1) + P(X=3) + \\dots$$\nThis infinite series has a well-known closed-form solution:\n$$r = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\exp(-2d))$$\nThis is the Haldane mapping function. We are given $r = 0.18$ and must solve for $d$.\n$$0.18 = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\exp(-2d))$$\nMultiplying by $2$:\n$$0.36 = 1 - \\exp(-2d)$$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$\\exp(-2d) = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64$$\nTo solve for $d$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-2d = \\ln(0.64)$$\n$$d = -\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(0.64)$$\nThis gives the distance $d$ in Morgans. We calculate its numerical value:\n$$d \\approx -\\frac{1}{2}(-0.446287) \\approx 0.2231435 \\text{ Morgans}$$\nConverting to centiMorgans:\n$$d_{Haldane, cM} = 0.2231435 \\times 100 \\approx 22.31435 \\text{ cM}$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $22.31$ cM.\n\nFinally, we must justify why the Haldane estimate ($d_{Haldane, cM} \\approx 22.31$) is larger than the linear approximation ($d_{linear, cM} = 18.00$). The discrepancy arises because the recombination fraction $r$ systematically underestimates the true map distance $d$. The linear approximation, $d \\approx r$, ignores the effect of multiple crossovers. The Haldane model explicitly accounts for them. Specifically, double crossover events (and all higher-order even-numbered crossover events) produce parental, non-recombinant haplotypes. These events contribute to the map distance $d$ (since $d$ counts all crossovers) but are not detected in the recombination fraction $r$. As the distance between genes increases, the probability of such multiple, \"masking\" crossovers becomes significant. To produce an observed recombination fraction of $r=0.18$, the true underlying frequency of crossovers, $d$, must be higher than $0.18$ to compensate for the fraction of double crossovers that are invisible to the recombination assay. The Haldane function provides the correct mathematical mapping to account for this underestimation. The linear approximation is only the first term in the Taylor series expansion of the Haldane function around $d=0$, which is $r = d - d^2 + \\dots$. For any $d  0$, the map distance $d$ will always be greater than the recombination fraction $r$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n18.00  22.31\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2817249"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principle that mapping functions correct for multiple crossovers, we can explore how different biological assumptions about crossover events lead to distinct mathematical models.

The relationship between the recombination fraction $r_K$ and the map distance $d$ (in Morgans) is given by:\n    $$r_K = \\frac{1}{2}\\tanh(2d)$$\n    where $\\tanh$ is the hyperbolic tangent function. Substituting the value $d = 0.3$:\n    $$r_K = \\frac{1}{2}\\tanh(2 \\times 0.3) = \\frac{1}{2}\\tanh(0.6)$$\n    We recall the definition of the hyperbolic tangent: $\\tanh(x) = \\frac{\\exp(2x) - 1}{\\exp(2x) + 1}$.
