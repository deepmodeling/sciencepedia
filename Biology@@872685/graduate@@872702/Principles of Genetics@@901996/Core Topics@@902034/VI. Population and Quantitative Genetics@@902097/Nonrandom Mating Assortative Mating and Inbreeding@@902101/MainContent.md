## Introduction
In population genetics, the Hardy-Weinberg principle provides a fundamental [null model](@entry_id:181842), describing a state of [genetic equilibrium](@entry_id:167050) in which allele and genotype frequencies remain stable across generations. This stability, however, depends on several strict assumptions, one of the most important being [random mating](@entry_id:149892). When individuals select mates based on specific criteria—such as [shared ancestry](@entry_id:175919) or similar phenotypes—this assumption is violated, and the population's genetic structure begins to change. Understanding the principles of [nonrandom mating](@entry_id:184998) is therefore essential for comprehending the evolutionary dynamics of real-world populations, from the persistence of rare genetic diseases in humans to the [genetic management](@entry_id:196396) of endangered species.

This article addresses the critical knowledge gap between the idealized world of [random mating](@entry_id:149892) and the complex reality of structured [mating systems](@entry_id:151977). It systematically dissects the two primary forms of [nonrandom mating](@entry_id:184998): [inbreeding](@entry_id:263386) and [assortative mating](@entry_id:270038). By exploring their distinct mechanisms and consequences, you will gain a sophisticated understanding of how they shape [genetic variation](@entry_id:141964) at both the individual and population levels.

To guide you through this topic, the article is structured into three comprehensive chapters. The first, **Principles and Mechanisms,** lays the theoretical groundwork, defining the genetic consequences of inbreeding and [assortative mating](@entry_id:270038) and introducing quantitative tools like the [inbreeding coefficient](@entry_id:190186) and F-statistics. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections,** demonstrates the profound relevance of these concepts in applied fields such as conservation biology, animal breeding, [human genetics](@entry_id:261875), and biotechnology. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** offers a series of problems that allow you to actively apply these principles to calculate genetic effects and interpret population data. We will begin by examining the core principles that distinguish [nonrandom mating](@entry_id:184998) from the baseline of panmixia.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The Hardy-Weinberg principle serves as the fundamental [null model](@entry_id:181842) in [population genetics](@entry_id:146344), describing a state of equilibrium where allele and genotype frequencies remain constant across generations. This equilibrium, however, hinges on a specific set of five stringent assumptions: no selection, no mutation, no migration, an infinitely large population (no [genetic drift](@entry_id:145594)), and [random mating](@entry_id:149892). When any of these assumptions are violated, the population evolves. This chapter focuses on the violation of the [random mating](@entry_id:149892) assumption, exploring the principles and mechanisms of [nonrandom mating](@entry_id:184998) systems and their profound consequences for the genetic architecture of populations.

### The Foundation of Random Mating

Under the Hardy-Weinberg framework, **[random mating](@entry_id:149892)**, or **panmixia**, implies that individuals mate without regard to their genotype or phenotype at the locus in question. Mechanistically, this is equivalent to the random union of gametes. If the [allele frequencies](@entry_id:165920) for a biallelic locus in the gene pool are $p$ and $q$, the probability of forming a [zygote](@entry_id:146894) of a specific genotype is the product of the frequencies of the uniting gametes. An $AA$ [zygote](@entry_id:146894) is formed by the fusion of an $A$-carrying egg (frequency $p$) and an $A$-carrying sperm (frequency $p$), yielding a [genotype frequency](@entry_id:141286) of $p^2$. Similarly, the frequency of $aa$ zygotes is $q^2$. A heterozygote, $Aa$, can be formed in two ways—an $A$-egg with an $a$-sperm or an $a$-egg with an $A$-sperm—resulting in a frequency of $pq + qp = 2pq$.

It is crucial to recognize that [random mating](@entry_id:149892) is the specific assumption responsible for establishing these binomial proportions ($p^2$, $2pq$, $q^2$) from the underlying allele frequencies in a single generation. The other four assumptions ensure that the allele frequencies themselves, $p$ and $q$, remain stable over time. A deviation from [random mating](@entry_id:149892) directly alters genotype frequencies, even if [allele frequencies](@entry_id:165920) are not changed by the process [@problem_id:2832900]. We now turn to the primary forms of such deviations.

### Forms of Nonrandom Mating

Nonrandom mating occurs whenever the probability of mating between individuals is not independent of their genetic or phenotypic constitution. The primary forms are categorized based on the criterion for [mate choice](@entry_id:273152): genealogical relationship or phenotype.

1.  **Inbreeding**: This is mating between individuals who are more closely related by ancestry than random pairs drawn from the population. The [mate choice](@entry_id:273152) is based on pedigree, not necessarily phenotype. The primary genetic consequence of [inbreeding](@entry_id:263386) is an increase in **[homozygosity](@entry_id:174206)**—the frequency of homozygous genotypes—across the entire genome. This occurs because relatives are more likely to share alleles that are copies of the same ancestral allele.

2.  **Assortative Mating**: This is mating based on phenotypic similarity.
    *   **Positive Assortative Mating**: Individuals preferentially mate with others of a similar phenotype ("like mates with like"). This leads to a positive correlation between the phenotypes of mating pairs. Its genetic effect is an increase in [homozygosity](@entry_id:174206), but specifically at the loci that influence the trait in question (and any loci in linkage disequilibrium with them).
    *   **Disassortative (or Negative) Mating**: Individuals preferentially mate with others of a dissimilar phenotype ("opposites attract"). This results in a negative phenotypic correlation between mates and leads to an excess of heterozygotes at the loci controlling the assortative trait.

A critical distinction, therefore, lies in the scope of the genetic effect. Inbreeding affects all loci genome-wide, whereas [assortative mating](@entry_id:270038) has locus-specific effects [@problem_id:2832906]. For instance, a population exhibiting [inbreeding](@entry_id:263386) due to mating between cousins ($\theta \approx 0.0625$, where $\theta$ is the kinship coefficient) would show a uniform excess of homozygotes across the genome ($F_{IS} > 0$), even with no specific phenotypic correlation between mates ($r_P \approx 0$). Conversely, a population with strong positive [assortative mating](@entry_id:270038) for a specific trait like height ($r_P > 0$) would show a deficit of heterozygotes only at the loci governing height, but not necessarily at other neutral loci throughout the genome ($\theta \approx 0$, genome-wide $F_{IS} \approx 0$) [@problem_id:2832906].

### The Genetics of Inbreeding

To understand [inbreeding](@entry_id:263386) quantitatively, we must introduce the concept of genetic identity.

#### Identity by Descent and the Inbreeding Coefficient

Two alleles are said to be **identical by state (IBS)** if they are the same allelic type (e.g., they are both allele $A$). In contrast, two alleles are **identical by descent (IBD)** if they are both physical copies of a single ancestral allele. Identity by descent is a more stringent condition and implies identity by state (barring mutation). For example, an individual with genotype $AA$ has alleles that are identical by state. However, they are only identical by descent if the $A$ from the mother and the $A$ from the father are copies of the very same DNA molecule from a common ancestor [@problem_id:2832875].

The **[inbreeding coefficient](@entry_id:190186) ($F$)** of an individual is formally defined as the probability that the two alleles at any given locus in that individual are identical by descent. An individual whose alleles at a locus are IBD is termed **autozygous**. An individual whose alleles are not IBD is termed **allozygous**. By definition, $F = \Pr(\text{autozygosity})$.

The inbreeding of an individual arises from the relatedness of its parents. This is formalized by the **kinship coefficient (or coefficient of coancestry), $\phi_{XY}$**, defined as the probability that an allele drawn at random from individual $X$ and an allele drawn at random from individual $Y$ are IBD. The [inbreeding coefficient](@entry_id:190186) of an offspring, $I$, is equal to the kinship coefficient of its parents, $M$ and $P$: $F_I = \phi_{MP}$. For example, for a child of first-cousin parents, the kinship coefficient of the parents is $\phi = 1/16$, and thus the child's [inbreeding coefficient](@entry_id:190186) is $F = 1/16$ [@problem_id:2832875].

An individual's kinship with itself, $\phi_{XX}$, is also a meaningful quantity. It can be derived by considering the sampling process: with probability $1/2$, we draw the same allele twice (which are IBD by definition), and with probability $1/2$, we draw the two different alleles within the individual (which are IBD with probability $F_X$). Thus, the total probability of IBD is $\phi_{XX} = \frac{1}{2}(1) + \frac{1}{2}(F_X) = \frac{1+F_X}{2}$ [@problem_id:2832931].

#### Impact on Genotype Frequencies

The [inbreeding coefficient](@entry_id:190186) allows us to predict genotype frequencies in a population with a given level of inbreeding. We can partition the population into two fractions: a fraction $F$ that is autozygous and a fraction $1-F$ that is allozygous.
*   In the autozygous fraction ($F$), an individual's two alleles are IBD. They are copies of a single allele drawn from the gene pool. The probability of this ancestral allele being $A$ is $p$, leading to an $AA$ genotype. The probability of it being $a$ is $q$, leading to an $aa$ genotype. Heterozygotes are impossible.
*   In the allozygous fraction ($1-F$), an individual's two alleles are not IBD and are equivalent to two independent draws from the gene pool. The genotype frequencies are thus given by Hardy-Weinberg proportions: $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2$.

Combining these, the total frequencies are [@problem_id:2832923]:
$f(AA) = F \cdot p + (1-F) \cdot p^2 = p^2 + F(p - p^2) = p^2 + Fpq$
$f(Aa) = F \cdot 0 + (1-F) \cdot 2pq = 2pq(1-F)$
$f(aa) = F \cdot q + (1-F) \cdot q^2 = q^2 + F(q - q^2) = q^2 + Fpq$

The most immediate consequence is a reduction in heterozygosity. The frequency of heterozygotes under inbreeding, $H_F$, is $H_F = 2pq(1-F)$. The heterozygosity in a randomly mating population with the same allele frequencies is $H_{HWE} = 2pq$. The ratio of the two is $H_F / H_{HWE} = 1-F$. This provides a powerful interpretation: the [inbreeding coefficient](@entry_id:190186) $F$ is precisely the fractional reduction in heterozygosity relative to the panmictic expectation [@problem_id:2832923]. For a population with $F=0.25$, heterozygosity is reduced by $0.25$, or $25\%$. It is crucial to note that [allele frequencies](@entry_id:165920) are not altered by this process; the frequency of allele $A$ in the inbred population is $f(AA) + \frac{1}{2}f(Aa) = (p^2+Fpq) + \frac{1}{2}(2pq(1-F)) = p^2+Fpq+pq-Fpq = p^2+pq = p(p+q) = p$.

### Disentangling Inbreeding from Population Structure

A deficit of heterozygotes is the primary signature of [inbreeding](@entry_id:263386), but it is not unique to it. A similar pattern, known as the **Wahlund effect**, arises when distinct subpopulations with different allele frequencies are pooled together for analysis.

Imagine a species divided into several demes that mate randomly within themselves but do not exchange migrants. If deme $i$ has allele frequency $p_i$, its internal heterozygosity will be $2p_iq_i$. If an investigator samples individuals from all demes and pools them, the total observed [heterozygosity](@entry_id:166208) will be the average of the within-deme heterozygosities, $\bar{H} = \sum c_i (2p_i q_i)$, where $c_i$ is the proportional size of deme $i$. The pooled [allele frequency](@entry_id:146872) is $\bar{p} = \sum c_i p_i$. The [expected heterozygosity](@entry_id:204049) based on this pooled frequency would be $2\bar{p}\bar{q}$. Due to Jensen's inequality, it is always true that $\bar{H} \le 2\bar{p}\bar{q}$. The deficit, $2\bar{p}\bar{q} - \bar{H}$, is equal to $2\mathrm{Var}(p_i)$, twice the variance of [allele frequencies](@entry_id:165920) across demes [@problem_id:2832873].

Thus, both [inbreeding](@entry_id:263386) and [population structure](@entry_id:148599) lead to a [heterozygote deficit](@entry_id:200653) in a pooled sample. The causal mechanisms, however, are distinct:
*   **Inbreeding**: A deviation from [random mating](@entry_id:149892) *within* a breeding unit. The deficit is real at the level of the population and will be observed in any [representative sample](@entry_id:201715).
*   **Wahlund Effect**: An artifact of pooling genetically distinct, randomly mating subpopulations. The deficit disappears if the analysis is stratified by subpopulation, as each is in HWE internally.

**Wright's F-statistics** provide a formal framework to partition these effects.
*   **$F_{IS}$** measures the reduction in heterozygosity of an *I*ndividual relative to its *S*ubpopulation. It reflects [nonrandom mating](@entry_id:184998) ([inbreeding](@entry_id:263386)) within that subpopulation. A positive $F_{IS}$ indicates [inbreeding](@entry_id:263386).
*   **$F_{ST}$** measures the reduction in [heterozygosity](@entry_id:166208) due to [allele frequency](@entry_id:146872) differences among *S*ubpopulations relative to the *T*otal population. It quantifies the degree of [genetic differentiation](@entry_id:163113).

In a case of pure inbreeding within a single, large population, we would find $F_{IS} > 0$ but $F_{ST} \approx 0$. In a case of pure population subdivision with internal [random mating](@entry_id:149892), we would find $F_{IS} \approx 0$ within each deme, but $F_{ST} > 0$ for the collection of demes [@problem_id:2832873].

### The Genetics of Assortative Mating

Assortative mating, based on phenotype, presents a different set of genetic consequences from [inbreeding](@entry_id:263386). While it also alters genotype frequencies, its effects are more specific.

A general model for [nonrandom mating](@entry_id:184998) can be constructed using a symmetric preference matrix, $\Theta = (\theta_{ij})$, where $\theta_{ij}$ represents the relative preference for matings between genotypes $i$ and $j$. In a population with genotype frequencies $\mathbf{x}=(x_{AA}, x_{Aa}, x_{aa})$, the frequency of mating between an [ordered pair](@entry_id:148349) of parents $(i,j)$ is given by $\frac{\theta_{ij} x_i x_j}{\mu(\mathbf{x})}$, where $\mu(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{r,s} \theta_{rs} x_r x_s$ is a normalization factor representing the mean fitness or preference in the population. The genotype frequencies in the next generation, $\mathbf{x}'$, can then be calculated by summing the contributions from all possible matings, weighted by their frequencies and the appropriate Mendelian transmission probabilities [@problem_id:2832909].

While [inbreeding](@entry_id:263386) affects the entire genome, the most striking effects of [assortative mating](@entry_id:270038) are seen in the context of **[quantitative traits](@entry_id:144946)**, which are influenced by many loci. Consider a trait $P$ determined by an additive genetic component $A$ and an environmental component $E$, such that $P = A + E$. Let the correlation between the phenotypes of mating pairs be $r_P$. After one generation of such mating, two key results emerge:
1.  **Allele frequencies remain unchanged.** As with inbreeding, [assortative mating](@entry_id:270038) only rearranges how existing alleles are combined into genotypes; it does not preferentially eliminate any alleles from the [gene pool](@entry_id:267957), provided there is no selection.
2.  **Additive [genetic variance](@entry_id:151205) increases.** This contrasts sharply with the common intuition from single-locus models. Phenotypic [assortative mating](@entry_id:270038) creates a correlation between the breeding values of mates, $A_f$ and $A_m$. This correlation can be shown to be $r_A = r_P h^2$, where $h^2 = V_A/V_P$ is the trait's [narrow-sense heritability](@entry_id:262760). This non-random association of parental breeding values induces a positive covariance between the gametes that unite to form offspring. The [additive genetic variance](@entry_id:154158) in the offspring generation, $V_A'$, becomes:
    $V_A' = V_A + \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{Cov}(A_f, A_m)$
    This increase in variance arises because [assortative mating](@entry_id:270038) generates non-random associations between alleles at different loci that affect the trait—that is, it creates **linkage disequilibrium**. It preferentially combines trait-increasing alleles from both parents, stretching the distribution of breeding values and thereby increasing its variance [@problem_id:2832877].

### Evolutionary and Genomic Ramifications

Nonrandom [mating systems](@entry_id:151977) are not just curiosities of population genetic theory; they have profound and observable consequences for evolution and genome structure.

#### Inbreeding Depression

One of the most significant consequences of [inbreeding](@entry_id:263386) is **[inbreeding depression](@entry_id:273650)**, the reduction in mean fitness of a population due to mating between relatives. This phenomenon is primarily explained by the presence of partially [recessive deleterious alleles](@entry_id:195788), which are common at low frequencies in many populations. Under [random mating](@entry_id:149892), these alleles exist mostly in heterozygotes, and their harmful effects are masked by the functional [wild-type allele](@entry_id:162987).

Inbreeding increases the frequency of [homozygous](@entry_id:265358) genotypes, including those for rare deleterious alleles. An individual [homozygous](@entry_id:265358) for a [deleterious allele](@entry_id:271628) $a_i$ with fitness $1-s_i$ suffers a significant [fitness cost](@entry_id:272780). Even if the allele is only partially recessive (fitness of heterozygote is $1-h_i s_i$ with $h_i  1/2$), the increased exposure of the [homozygous](@entry_id:265358) state drives down the population's mean fitness.

For a multiplicative fitness model across many loci, the [inbreeding depression](@entry_id:273650), $\delta(F) = 1 - \overline{W}(F)/\overline{W}(0)$, can be approximated as:
$$ \delta(F) \approx 1 - \exp\left(-F \sum_i p_i q_i s_i (1 - 2h_i)\right) $$
Here, $\overline{W}(F)$ is the mean fitness with [inbreeding coefficient](@entry_id:190186) $F$. The term $(1-2h_i)$ captures the degree to which deleterious effects are recessive; for a fully recessive allele ($h_i=0$), the term is 1, while for an additive allele ($h_i=0.5$), the term is 0 and this mechanism contributes nothing to [inbreeding depression](@entry_id:273650) [@problem_id:2832908].

#### Runs of Homozygosity (ROH)

The genome-wide increase in [homozygosity](@entry_id:174206) caused by [inbreeding](@entry_id:263386) leaves a distinct signature in an individual's DNA sequence: long, contiguous stretches of [homozygous](@entry_id:265358) genotypes. These are known as **[runs of homozygosity](@entry_id:174661) (ROH)**. They arise when an individual inherits the same chromosomal segment from both parents, a segment that is IBD because the parents share a recent common ancestor.

The properties of ROHs provide a window into an individual's demographic and family history.
*   **Number of ROHs**: If we model the genome as a series of independent Bernoulli trials (unlinked loci), where being [heterozygous](@entry_id:276964) is a "success" with a small probability $p = H_0(1-F_t)$, then the number of consecutive [homozygous](@entry_id:265358) loci between two heterozygotes follows a [geometric distribution](@entry_id:154371). As inbreeding proceeds (e.g., through repeated selfing), $F_t$ increases, heterozygosity declines, and the expected length of these runs of [homozygous](@entry_id:265358) loci increases [@problem_id:2832926].
*   **Length of ROHs**: The physical length of an ROH is highly informative. Crossovers break down IBD tracts over generations. A segment inherited from a common ancestor $g$ generations ago will have been transmitted through $2g$ meiotic events. Its expected length is inversely proportional to $g$. Specifically, the length is exponentially distributed with a mean of $\frac{1}{2g}$ Morgans. Therefore, **long ROHs are a signature of recent [inbreeding](@entry_id:263386)**, while **short ROHs are a remnant of ancient [common ancestry](@entry_id:176322)** [@problem_id:2832926]. Modern genomic analysis of ROH patterns allows researchers to infer not only if an individual is inbred, but also how recently that [inbreeding](@entry_id:263386) occurred.
