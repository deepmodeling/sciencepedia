It presents a canonical model in population genetics for the effect of mutation on allele frequencies in an idealized population. The assumptions, such as an infinite population, serve to isolate the deterministic pressure of mutation from the stochastic effects of genetic drift, which is a standard and necessary simplification for introducing the concept. The problem is well-posed, with all variables ($\\mu, \\nu, p_t$) and conditions clearly defined, leading to a solvable system. The language is objective and formal. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles of mathematics or genetics. It is a complete and consistent statement of a fundamental concept.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Recurrence Relation for $p_t$**\n\nLet $p_t$ be the frequency of allele $A$ in generation $t$. Consequently, the frequency of allele $a$ in generation $t$ is $q_t = 1 - p_t$. We wish to find the frequency of allele $A$ in the next generation, $p_{t+1}$. The calculation is based on tracking the origins of alleles in generation $t+1$ from the gene pool of generation $t$.\n\nAn allele $A$ in generation $t+1$ can arise from two mutually exclusive events in generation $t$:\ni) An allele was $A$ in generation $t$ and did not mutate to $a$. The probability of an $A$ allele not mutating is $(1 - \\mu)$.\nii) An allele was $a$ in generation $t$ and mutated to $A$. The probability of an $a$ allele mutating is $\\nu$.\n\nThe frequency of alleles of type $A$ that do not mutate is the product of their initial frequency and the probability of non-mutation: $p_t (1 - \\mu)$.\nThe frequency of alleles of type $a$ that do mutate to $A$ is the product of their initial frequency and the probability of mutation: $(1 - p_t) \\nu$.\n\nBy the law of total probability, the total frequency of allele $A$ in generation $t+1$ is the sum of the frequencies from these two pathways:\n$$p_{t+1} = p_t (1 - \\mu) + (1 - p_t) \\nu$$\nThis is the deterministic mapping that gives $p_{t+1}$ as a function of $p_t$. This can be rearranged into a linear map form:\n$$p_{t+1} = p_t - \\mu p_t + \\nu - \\nu p_t$$\n$$p_{t+1} = p_t (1 - \\mu - \\nu) + \\nu$$\n\n**2. Calculation of Equilibrium Allele Frequencies**\n\nAn equilibrium is a state where the allele frequency no longer changes over time. At equilibrium, we have $p_{t+1} = p_t = \\hat{p}$. Substituting $\\hat{p}$ into the recurrence relation:\n$$\\hat{p} = \\hat{p}(1 - \\mu - \\nu) + \\nu$$\nWe solve this equation for $\\hat{p}$:\n$$\\hat{p} - \\hat{p}(1 - \\mu - \\nu) = \\nu$$\n$$\\hat{p} (1 - (1 - \\mu - \\nu)) = \\nu$$\n$$\\hat{p} (\\mu + \\nu) = \\nu$$\n\nWe must now consider two cases for the sum $\\mu + \\nu$:\nCase A: $\\mu + \\nu > 0$.\nIn this case, we can divide by $(\\mu + \\nu)$ to find a unique equilibrium frequency:\n$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\mu + \\nu}$$\nSince $\\mu \\ge 0$ and $\\nu \\ge 0$, this equilibrium frequency $\\hat{p}$ is guaranteed to be in the interval $[0,1]$. Specifically, if $\\mu > 0$ and $\\nu > 0$, then $0 < \\hat{p} < 1$, which is an internal or polymorphic equilibrium. If $\\mu > 0$ and $\\nu = 0$, then $\\hat{p} = 0$. If $\\mu = 0$ and $\\nu > 0$, then $\\hat{p} = 1$.\n\nCase B: $\\mu + \\nu = 0$.\nSince $\\mu \\ge 0$ and $\\nu \\ge 0$, this implies $\\mu = 0$ and $\\nu = 0$. In this scenario, there is no mutation. The recurrence relation becomes $p_{t+1} = p_t(1 - 0 - 0) + 0$, which simplifies to $p_{t+1} = p_t$.\nThe equilibrium equation becomes $\\hat{p}(\\mu+\\nu) = \\nu \\implies \\hat{p}(0) = 0$, which is true for any value of $\\hat{p}$. Therefore, when there is no mutation, any allele frequency $p \\in [0,1]$ is an equilibrium.\n\nIn summary, for $\\mu+\\nu>0$, there is a single equilibrium $\\hat{p} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\mu+\\nu}$. For $\\mu=\\nu=0$, all $p \\in [0,1]$ are equilibria.\n\n**3. Stability Analysis of the Equilibria**\n\nThe local stability of a fixed point $\\hat{p}$ for a one-dimensional discrete map $p_{t+1} = f(p_t)$ is determined by the magnitude of the derivative of the mapping function, $f'(p)$, evaluated at the fixed point. The equilibrium is locally stable if $|f'(\\hat{p})| < 1$, neutrally stable if $|f'(\\hat{p})| = 1$, and unstable if $|f'(\\hat{p})| > 1$.\n\nThe mapping is $f(p_t) = p_t(1 - \\mu - \\nu) + \\nu$. This is a linear function of $p_t$. The derivative is constant for all $p_t$:\n$$f'(p_t) = \\frac{d}{dp_t} \\left[ p_t(1 - \\mu - \\nu) + \\nu \\right] = 1 - \\mu - \\nu$$\nTherefore, the stability condition is independent of the equilibrium point $\\hat{p}$ and is simply:\n$$|1 - \\mu - \\nu| < 1$$\nThis inequality is equivalent to $-1 < 1 - \\mu - \\nu < 1$.\n\nWe analyze the two parts of the inequality:\n1) $1 - \\mu - \\nu < 1 \\implies -(\\mu + \\nu) < 0 \\implies \\mu + \\nu > 0$.\n2) $-1 < 1 - \\mu - \\nu \\implies \\mu + \\nu < 2$.\n\nThus, the equilibrium is locally stable if and only if $0 < \\mu + \\nu < 2$.\n\nThe parameters $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ represent mutation probabilities, so they must lie in the interval $[0,1]$. This implies that the sum $\\mu + \\nu$ is always in the interval $[0,2]$.\n\nLet us classify the stability based on the values of $\\mu$ and $\\nu$:\n- If $0 < \\mu + \\nu < 2$: The condition $|1 - \\mu - \\nu| < 1$ is satisfied. The unique equilibrium $\\hat{p} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\mu + \\nu}$ is locally stable. Because the map is linear, this stability is global; any initial frequency $p_0 \\in [0,1]$ will converge to this equilibrium. This covers the case of a single positive mutation rate (e.g., $\\mu>0, \\nu=0$) and the case of two positive mutation rates (e.g., $\\mu>0, \\nu>0$).\n- If $\\mu + \\nu = 0$: This means $\\mu = 0$ and $\\nu = 0$. The derivative is $1 - 0 = 1$. Since $|f'(\\hat{p})| = 1$, all equilibria in the set $[0,1]$ are neutrally stable. This is expected, as there is no force to change the allele frequency.\n- If $\\mu + \\nu = 2$: This occurs only if $\\mu=1$ and $\\nu=1$. The derivative is $1 - 2 = -1$. Since $|f'(\\hat{p})| = 1$, the equilibrium $\\hat{p} = \\frac{1}{1+1} = \\frac{1}{2}$ is neutrally stable. The map becomes $p_{t+1} = 1 - p_t$. Any initial state $p_0 \\neq \\frac{1}{2}$ leads to a persistent oscillation (a 2-cycle) between $p_0$ and $1-p_0$, and does not converge to the equilibrium.\n\nThe problem requests the internal-equilibrium allele frequency. An internal equilibrium is one for which $\\hat{p} \\in (0,1)$. From our analysis, this occurs when both $\\mu > 0$ and $\\nu > 0$. Under these conditions, the equilibrium is $\\hat{p} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\mu+\\nu}$ and it is stable, provided $\\mu+\\nu < 2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\nu}{\\mu + \\nu}}\n$$", "id": "2814732"}, {"introduction": "The Hardy-Weinberg principle rests on the key assumption of random mating.

Assume no mutation, no migration, and no viability or fecundity differences among genotypes. In generation $t \\rightarrow t+1$, mating deviates from random as follows: with probability $r$ a randomly chosen mating pair is constrained to be composed of two individuals of the same genotype (positive assortative mating by genotype), and with probability $1-r$ the pair is formed by random mating.

The problem is mathematically formalizable and its solution is verifiable through logical derivation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nWe begin by establishing the notation. Let the allele frequencies of $A$ and $a$ in generation $t$ be $p$ and $q=1-p$ respectively. The genotype frequencies at the start of generation $t$ are given as $P_t = f(AA) = p^2$, $H_t = f(Aa) = 2p(1-p)$, and $Q_t = f(aa) = (1-p)^2$. The total population of zygotes in generation $t+1$ is formed by a mixture of offspring from two distinct mating processes: random mating, occurring with probability $1-r$, and positive assortative mating, occurring with probability $r$.\n\n**1) Justification of Allele Frequency Invariance**\n\nWe must demonstrate from first principles that the allele frequency of $A$ in generation $t+1$, denoted $p_{t+1}$, is equal to $p$ and is independent of $r$. This is achieved by analyzing the allele frequency of the offspring produced by each mating system separately.\n\ni) **Random Mating**: A randomly mating population produces a gene pool of gametes that perfectly reflects the allele frequencies of the parent generation. The frequency of $A$ gametes is $p$ and the frequency of $a$ gametes is $1-p$. The random fusion of these gametes produces zygotes where the frequency of allele $A$ is axiomatically $p$. Thus, the sub-population of offspring derived from random mating has an allele $A$ frequency of $p$.\n\nii) **Positive Assortative Mating**: Under this system, individuals mate only with others of the same genotype. The matings are $AA \\times AA$, $Aa \\times Aa$, and $aa \\times aa$. The relative frequencies of these mating types are proportional to the frequencies of the corresponding genotypes in the parent population: $p^2$, $2p(1-p)$, and $(1-p)^2$, respectively. We calculate the allele frequency of $A$ among the offspring produced by this system.\n\n- Mating $AA \\times AA$: Produces only $AA$ offspring. All alleles are $A$. The allele frequency of $A$ is $1$.\n- Mating $Aa \\times Aa$: Produces offspring $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ in the ratio $1:2:1$. The allele frequency of $A$ in this offspring group is $\\frac{1 \\times (\\frac{1}{4}) + \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\frac{1}{2})}{(\\frac{1}{4}) + (\\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{4})} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Mating $aa \\times aa$: Produces only $aa$ offspring. No alleles are $A$. The allele frequency of $A$ is $0$.\n\nThe overall allele frequency of $A$ in the offspring from the assortative mating group, $p_{\\text{assort}}$, is the weighted average of the allele frequencies from each mating type, where the weights are the frequencies of those mating types:\n$$p_{\\text{assort}} = \\frac{p^2 \\cdot 1 + 2p(1-p) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + (1-p)^2 \\cdot 0}{p^2 + 2p(1-p) + (1-p)^2}$$\nThe denominator is the sum of genotype frequencies, which is $(p+(1-p))^2=1$.\n$$p_{\\text{assort}} = p^2 + p(1-p) = p^2 + p - p^2 = p$$\nThus, the sub-population of offspring derived from positive assortative mating also has an allele $A$ frequency of $p$.\n\nSince both the random mating component and the assortative mating component produce offspring with an allele $A$ frequency of $p$, any weighted average of these two components must also result in an overall allele frequency of $p$.\n$$p_{t+1} = (1-r) \\cdot p + r \\cdot p = p$$\nThis concludes the proof that the allele frequency of $A$ in generation $t+1$ is $p$ and does not depend on $r$.\n\n**2) Derivation of Heterozygote Frequency**\n\nWe derive the expected frequency of heterozygotes ($Aa$) among zygotes in generation $t+1$, denoted $H_{t+1}$, as a function of $p$ and $r$. $H_{t+1}$ is the weighted average of the heterozygote frequencies produced by the two mating systems.\n\ni) **Frequency from Random Mating ($H_{\\text{RM}}$)**: The offspring of a randomly mating population with allele frequency $p$ are in Hardy-Weinberg proportions. The expected frequency of heterozygotes is:\n$$H_{\\text{RM}} = 2p(1-p)$$\n\nii) **Frequency from Assortative Mating ($H_{\\text{AM}}$)**: Heterozygotes can only be produced by $Aa \\times Aa$ matings. As established, the frequency of this mating type within the assortative group is $H_t = 2p(1-p)$. These matings produce heterozygous ($Aa$) offspring with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the frequency of heterozygotes in the offspring from the assortative group is:\n$$H_{\\text{AM}} = (\\text{Frequency of } Aa \\times Aa \\text{ matings}) \\times (\\text{Proportion of } Aa \\text{ offspring})$$\n$$H_{\\text{AM}} = [2p(1-p)] \\times \\frac{1}{2} = p(1-p)$$\n\nThe total frequency of heterozygotes in generation $t+1$ is the weighted sum of the contributions from each mating system:\n$$H_{t+1} = (1-r) H_{\\text{RM}} + r H_{\\text{AM}}$$\n$$H_{t+1} = (1-r) [2p(1-p)] + r [p(1-p)]$$\nFactoring out the term $p(1-p)$:\n$$H_{t+1} = [2(1-r) + r] p(1-p)$$\n$$H_{t+1} = (2 - 2r + r) p(1-p)$$\n$$H_{t+1} = (2-r) p(1-p)$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the expected heterozygote frequency among zygotes in generation $t+1$.\n\n**3) Calculation of Heterozygote Deficit ($D$)**\n\nThe heterozygote deficit $D$ is defined as the difference between the HWE expected frequency, $H_{\\text{HWE}} = 2p(1-p)$, and the observed frequency $H_{t+1}$.\n$$D = H_{\\text{HWE}} - H_{t+1}$$\nUsing the expression for $H_{t+1}$ from part 2:\n$$D = 2p(1-p) - (2-r)p(1-p)$$\n$$D = [2 - (2-r)] p(1-p)$$\n$$D = (2 - 2 + r) p(1-p)$$\n$$D = rp(1-p)$$\nThis simple result shows that the deficit in heterozygotes is directly proportional to the fraction of assortative matings $r$ and the variance of an indicator variable for the allele, $p(1-p)$.\n\nWe are asked to compute $D$ for $p = 0.37$ and $r = 0.60$.\n$$D = (0.60) \\times (0.37) \\times (1 - 0.37)$$\n$$D = 0.60 \\times 0.37 \\times 0.63$$\n$$D = 0.222 \\times 0.63$$\n$$D = 0.13986$$\nRounding the result to $4$ significant figures, we obtain $0.1399$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1399}$$", "id": "2814726"}, {"introduction": "In any population of finite size, allele frequencies fluctuate randomly over time due to sampling effects—a process known as genetic drift.

The total population size is constant at $N$. The frequency of allele $A$ is $p(t) = i(t)/N$. We are given that the system evolves according to a single-birth–single-death mechanism, where event times follow a Poisson process with a rate $\\lambda$ such that the expected number of events in unit time is $N/2$.

Consequently, the possible values for $\\Delta p$ are $+1/N$, $-1/N$, and $0$.\nThe quantity we need to compute is:\n$$ \\lim_{\\Delta t\\to 0}\\frac{\\operatorname{Var}\\!\\big(\\Delta p \\mid p(t)=p\\big)}{\\Delta t} $$\nThe variance is defined as $\\operatorname{Var}(\\Delta p) = E[(\\Delta p)^2] - (E[\\Delta p])^2$.\n\nFirst, we compute the expected change in allele frequency, $E[\\Delta p]$.\n$$ E[\\Delta p \\mid i] = \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right) P(\\Delta i = +1) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{N}\\right) P(\\Delta i = -1) + (0) P(\\Delta i = 0) $$\n$$ E[\\Delta p \\mid i] = \\frac{1}{N} \\left(\\frac{i(N-i)}{2N}\\Delta t\\right) - \\frac{1}{N} \\left(\\frac{i(N-i)}{2N}\\Delta t\\right) + o(\\Delta t) = 0 \\cdot \\Delta t + o(\\Delta t) = o(\\Delta t) $$\nThis result, that the expected change is zero, is a hallmark of neutral evolution.\nFrom this, $(E[\\Delta p])^2 = (o(\\Delta t))^2 = o(\\Delta t^2)$.\n\nNext, we compute the expected squared change, $E[(\\Delta p)^2]$.\n$$ E[(\\Delta p)^2 \\mid i] = \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right)^2 P(\\Delta i = +1) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{N}\\right)^2 P(\\Delta i = -1) + (0)^2 P(\\Delta i = 0) $$\n$$ E[(\\Delta p)^2 \\mid i] = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\left(\\frac{i(N-i)}{2N}\\Delta t\\right) + \\frac{1}{N^2} \\left(\\frac{i(N-i)}{2N}\\Delta t\\right) + o(\\Delta t) $$\n$$ E[(\\Delta p)^2 \\mid i] = \\frac{2}{N^2} \\frac{i(N-i)}{2N}\\Delta t + o(\\Delta t) = \\frac{i(N-i)}{N^3}\\Delta t + o(\\Delta t) $$\n\nNow we can find the variance of $\\Delta p$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(\\Delta p \\mid i) = E[(\\Delta p)^2 \\mid i] - (E[\\Delta p \\mid i])^2 = \\left(\\frac{i(N-i)}{N^3}\\Delta t + o(\\Delta t)\\right) - o(\\Delta t^2) = \\frac{i(N-i)}{N^3}\\Delta t + o(\\Delta t) $$\n\nFinally, we compute the infinitesimal variance per unit time by dividing by $\\Delta t$ and taking the limit as $\\Delta t \\to 0$:\n$$ \\lim_{\\Delta t\\to 0}\\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(\\Delta p \\mid i)}{\\Delta t} = \\lim_{\\Delta t\\to 0}\\frac{\\frac{i(N-i)}{N^3}\\Delta t + o(\\Delta t)}{\\Delta t} = \\lim_{\\Delta t\\to 0}\\left(\\frac{i(N-i)}{N^3} + \\frac{o(\\Delta t)}{\\Delta t}\\right) = \\frac{i(N-i)}{N^3} $$\nThe expression must be in terms of $p$ and $N$. We substitute $i=Np$:\n$$ \\frac{Np(N-Np)}{N^3} = \\frac{N^2p(1-p)}{N^3} = \\frac{p(1-p)}{N} $$\nThis expression represents the instantaneous rate of increase of variance in allele frequency due to genetic drift under the specified Moran model.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{p(1-p)}{N}}\n$$", "id": "2814741"}]}
