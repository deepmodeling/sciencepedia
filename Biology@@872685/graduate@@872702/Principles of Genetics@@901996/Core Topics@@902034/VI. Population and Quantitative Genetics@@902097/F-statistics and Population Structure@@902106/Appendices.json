This exercise [@problem_id:2745314] provides a clear and focused illustration of this principle by starting with known allele frequencies in two hypothetical demes, allowing you to directly quantify the reduction in heterozygosity that occurs when genetically distinct populations are pooled. This practice will deepen your intuition for why variance in allele frequencies among demes translates directly into a positive $F_{ST}$ value.", "problem": "A subdivided population consists of $2$ demes of equal census size. At a biallelic locus with alleles $A$ and $a$, the allele $A$ has frequency $p_1 = 0.2$ in deme $1$ and $p_2 = 0.8$ in deme $2$. Each deme is internally at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Assume random sampling from the union of demes without regard to deme labels.\n\nUsing only foundational definitions from population genetics (the HWE genotype proportions within a deme; allele-frequency averaging across equally sized demes; and the Wright fixation-index framework that partitions heterozygosity into within- and total components), derive and compute:\n- the pooled expected heterozygosity under panmixia of the pooled sample (i.e., the expected heterozygosity if the pooled population were a single randomly mating unit), and\n- the Wahlund effect as both (i) the absolute heterozygote deficit of the pooled sample relative to panmixia and (ii) the standardized deficit defined by Wright’s fixation index for population structure.\n\nReport your answers in the order: pooled expected heterozygosity under panmixia, absolute deficit attributable to the Wahlund effect, standardized deficit. Provide exact values (no rounding). Do not use a percentage sign; express proportions as decimals or fractions without units.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard exercise in population genetics that can be solved using foundational principles. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of three quantities related to population structure: the total expected heterozygosity under panmixia ($H_T$), the absolute heterozygote deficit due to the Wahlund effect, and the standardized deficit represented by the fixation index $F_{ST}$.\n\nLet the frequencies of allele $A$ in deme $1$ and deme $2$ be $p_1$ and $p_2$, respectively. The provided values are $p_1 = 0.2$ and $p_2 = 0.8$. The population consists of $2$ demes of equal census size.\n\nFirst, we determine the average allele frequency of $A$ in the total population, denoted as $\\bar{p}$. Since the demes are of equal size, $\\bar{p}$ is the unweighted arithmetic mean of the deme-specific allele frequencies:\n$$\n\\bar{p} = \\frac{p_1 + p_2}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\bar{p} = \\frac{0.2 + 0.8}{2} = \\frac{1.0}{2} = 0.5\n$$\nThe average frequency of the alternative allele, $a$, is $\\bar{q} = 1 - \\bar{p} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$.\n\nThe first quantity to be computed is the pooled expected heterozygosity under panmixia, $H_T$. This is the expected frequency of heterozygotes if the entire pooled population were a single, randomly mating unit. It is calculated using the average allele frequencies under the assumption of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE):\n$$\nH_T = 2\\bar{p}\\bar{q}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated average frequencies:\n$$\nH_T = 2(0.5)(0.5) = 0.5\n$$\nThis is the first required answer.\n\nNext, we address the Wahlund effect, which describes the deficit of heterozygotes upon pooling subdivided populations. To quantify this, we must first calculate the average heterozygosity within the subpopulations, denoted as $H_S$. Each deme is stated to be in HWE. Therefore, the expected heterozygosity within each deme $i$ is $H_i = 2p_i q_i = 2p_i(1 - p_i)$.\n\nFor deme $1$:\n$$\nH_1 = 2p_1(1-p_1) = 2(0.2)(1-0.2) = 2(0.2)(0.8) = 0.32\n$$\nFor deme $2$:\n$$\nH_2 = 2p_2(1-p_2) = 2(0.8)(1-0.8) = 2(0.8)(0.2) = 0.32\n$$\nThe average heterozygosity across the subpopulations, $H_S$, is the weighted average of the individual deme heterozygosities. Since the demes are of equal size, this is the simple arithmetic mean:\n$$\nH_S = \\frac{H_1 + H_2}{2} = \\frac{0.32 + 0.32}{2} = 0.32\n$$\n$H_S$ represents the expected frequency of heterozygotes in a sample drawn randomly from the subdivided population.\n\nThe absolute heterozygote deficit, which is the quantitative measure of the Wahlund effect, is the difference between the expected heterozygosity under panmixia ($H_T$) and the average observed heterozygosity within demes ($H_S$):\n$$\n\\text{Absolute Deficit} = H_T - H_S\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\n\\text{Absolute Deficit} = 0.5 - 0.32 = 0.18\n$$\nThis is the second required answer. This deficit arises because mating is restricted to within demes, preventing allele combinations between individuals from different demes that would be possible under panmixia.\n\nFinally, we compute the standardized deficit, which is Wright's fixation index for population structure, $F_{ST}$. It quantifies the reduction in heterozygosity in subpopulations relative to the total population. It is defined as the correlation between two gametes drawn at random from a subpopulation, or equivalently, as the standardized variance in allele frequencies among subpopulations. The definition in terms of heterozygosities is:\n$$\nF_{ST} = \\frac{H_T - H_S}{H_T}\n$$\nUsing our previously computed values:\n$$\nF_{ST} = \\frac{0.18}{0.5} = \\frac{18}{50} = \\frac{9}{25} = 0.36\n$$\nThis is the third and final required answer. This value indicates that $36\\%$ of the genetic variation in the total population is due to allele frequency differences between the two demes. This result can be confirmed by relating $F_{ST}$ to the variance of allele frequencies among subpopulations, $\\sigma_p^2$: $F_{ST} = \\frac{\\sigma_p^2}{\\bar{p}\\bar{q}}$. Here, $\\sigma_p^2 = \\frac{(p_1 - \\bar{p})^2 + (p_2 - \\bar{p})^2}{2} = \\frac{(0.2 - 0.5)^2 + (0.8 - 0.5)^2}{2} = \\frac{(-0.3)^2 + (0.3)^2}{2} = \\frac{0.09 + 0.09}{2} = 0.09$. Thus, $F_{ST} = \\frac{0.09}{0.5 \\times 0.5} = \\frac{0.09}{0.25} = 0.36$, which validates our calculation.\n\nThe final results are $H_T = 0.5$, the absolute deficit is $0.18$, and $F_{ST} = 0.36$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.5  0.18  0.36 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2745314"}, {"introduction": "Real populations are often subject to multiple evolutionary forces acting at different hierarchical levels.

This could be due to negative assortative mating or heterozygote advantage (overdominance). The positive value of $F_{ST}$ confirms population structure; the two demes are genetically distinct. This differentiation leads to a deficit of heterozygotes when the subpopulations are considered as a single entity, which is the essence of the Wahlund effect. The apparently paradoxical situation of local heterozygote excess ($F_{IS}0$) combined with population subdivision ($F_{ST}0$) is a classic case study in population genetics, illustrating that different evolutionary processes can operate simultaneously at different hierarchical levels.\n\nThe final answer requested is the value of $F_{ST}$ rounded to four significant figures.\nOur calculated value is exactly $0.16$.
