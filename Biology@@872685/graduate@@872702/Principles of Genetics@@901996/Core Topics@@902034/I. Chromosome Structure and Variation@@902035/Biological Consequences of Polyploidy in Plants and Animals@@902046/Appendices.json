It presents a standard, formalizable model of polysomic inheritance, providing all necessary definitions and constraints to derive a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet the autotetraploid genotype be $Aaaa$. We can represent the four homologous chromosomes as $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4$. Without loss of generality, let the allele on chromosome $C_1$ be $A$, and the alleles on chromosomes $C_2, C_3$, and $C_4$ be $a$. A disomic gamete is formed by two alleles drawn from this set of four.\n\nFirst, we address Task $1$: the derivation of gamete genotype frequencies assuming random chromosome segregation and no double reduction.\nThe problem states that without double reduction, a disomic gamete is formed by sampling two distinct homologous chromosomes. The total number of ways to choose an unordered pair of chromosomes from the four available is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{4}{2}$.\n$$ \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6 $$\nThese six equally likely combinations of chromosomes determine the resulting gamete genotypes:\n$1$. $\\{C_1, C_2\\}$, carrying alleles $\\{A, a\\}$, results in an $Aa$ gamete.\n$2$. $\\{C_1, C_3\\}$, carrying alleles $\\{A, a\\}$, results in an $Aa$ gamete.\n$3$. $\\{C_1, C_4\\}$, carrying alleles $\\{A, a\\}$, results in an $Aa$ gamete.\n$4$. $\\{C_2, C_3\\}$, carrying alleles $\\{a, a\\}$, results in an $aa$ gamete.\n$5$. $\\{C_2, C_4\\}$, carrying alleles $\\{a, a\\}$, results in an $aa$ gamete.\n$6$. $\\{C_3, C_4\\}$, carrying alleles $\\{a, a\\}$, results in an $aa$ gamete.\n\nWe count the number of combinations leading to each gamete genotype:\n- To form an $AA$ gamete, two chromosomes carrying $A$ must be chosen. Since there is only one such chromosome ($C_1$), this is impossible. The count is $0$.\n- To form an $Aa$ gamete, one chromosome with $A$ and one with $a$ must be chosen. There is $\\binom{1}{1}$ way to choose the chromosome with $A$ and $\\binom{3}{1}$ ways to choose a chromosome with $a$. The count is $\\binom{1}{1}\\binom{3}{1} = 1 \\times 3 = 3$.\n- To form an $aa$ gamete, two chromosomes with $a$ must be chosen. There are $3$ such chromosomes. The count is $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$.\n\nThe total count is $0 + 3 + 3 = 6$, which matches our total number of combinations. Let $DR^c$ denote the event of no double reduction. The probabilities, conditional on $DR^c$, are:\n$$ \\Pr(AA | DR^c) = \\frac{0}{6} = 0 $$\n$$ \\Pr(Aa | DR^c) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n$$ \\Pr(aa | DR^c) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThis completes the first task.\n\nNext, we address Task $2$: incorporating a double reduction rate of $\\alpha$.\nWe will use the law of total probability.

Consequently, $\\Pr(DR^c) = 1 - \\alpha$.\n\nWe must determine the gamete probabilities conditional on double reduction, $\\Pr(G | DR)$. Double reduction is the event that both allelic copies in a gamete derive from the same pre-meiotic homolog. The problem specifies that conditional on $DR$, each of the $4$ homologous chromosomes ($C_1$ with allele $A$; $C_2, C_3, C_4$ with allele $a$) is an equally likely source.\n- If the source homolog is $C_1$ (carrying $A$), the gamete receives two $A$ alleles, forming an $AA$ gamete. The probability of this is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n- If the source homolog is $C_2, C_3,$ or $C_4$ (each carrying $a$), the gamete receives two $a$ alleles, forming an $aa$ gamete. The probability of this is $\\frac{3}{4}$.\n- It is impossible to form an $Aa$ gamete via double reduction, as it requires alleles from different homologs.\n\nThe probabilities conditional on double reduction are therefore:\n$$ \\Pr(AA | DR) = \\frac{1}{4} $$\n$$ \\Pr(Aa | DR) = 0 $$\n$$ \\Pr(aa | DR) = \\frac{3}{4} $$\n\nWe now substitute these conditional probabilities into the law of total probability for each gamete genotype.\n\nFor the $AA$ gamete:\n$$ \\Pr(AA) = \\Pr(AA | DR) \\alpha + \\Pr(AA | DR^c) (1 - \\alpha) $$\n$$ \\Pr(AA) = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\alpha + (0)(1 - \\alpha) = \\frac{1}{4}\\alpha $$\n\nFor the $Aa$ gamete:\n$$ \\Pr(Aa) = \\Pr(Aa | DR) \\alpha + \\Pr(Aa | DR^c) (1 - \\alpha) $$\n$$ \\Pr(Aa) = (0)\\alpha + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(1 - \\alpha) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\alpha) $$\n\nFor the $aa$ gamete:\n$$ \\Pr(aa) = \\Pr(aa | DR) \\alpha + \\Pr(aa | DR^c) (1 - \\alpha) $$\n$$ \\Pr(aa) = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\alpha + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(1 - \\alpha) $$\n$$ \\Pr(aa) = \\frac{3}{4}\\alpha + \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2} + \\left(\\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{2}{4}\\right)\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4}\\alpha $$\n\nTo verify correctness, we confirm that the probabilities sum to $1$:\n$$ \\Pr(AA) + \\Pr(Aa) + \\Pr(aa) = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\alpha\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4}\\alpha\\right) $$\n$$ = \\left(\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\alpha + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = (0)\\alpha + 1 = 1 $$\nThe derivation is logically consistent.

Given a biallelic locus with alleles $A$ and $a$ at population frequencies $p$ and $q = 1-p$ respectively, the formation of a zygote is equivalent to drawing $4$ alleles at random from the gene pool. The number of $A$ alleles in a zygote thus follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n=4$ (the ploidy level) and probability $p$ (the frequency of allele $A$).\n\nThe probability of a zygote having exactly $k$ copies of allele $A$ and $4-k$ copies of allele $a$ is given by the binomial formula:\n$$ P(\\text{Genotype with } k \\text{ copies of } A) = \\binom{4}{k} p^k q^{4-k} $$\n\nUsing this principle, we derive the frequencies for the five possible genotype classes:\n\n1.

The process is equivalent to drawing $2$ alleles at random from the gene pool. The genotype frequencies follow the binomial expansion of $(p+q)^2$.\n\n1.  Genotype $AA$:\n    $$ \\text{freq}(AA) = \\binom{2}{2} p^2 q^0 = p^2 $$\n\n2.  Genotype $Aa$:\n    $$ \\text{freq}(Aa) = \\binom{2}{1} p^1 q^1 = 2pq $$\n\n3.

For a set of one-to-one orthologous genes, you have RNA sequencing (RNA-seq; Ribonucleic Acid sequencing) data from leaf tissue: Parent A has $3$ biological replicates, Parent B has $3$ biological replicates, and the allotetraploid has $3$ biological replicates. Raw counts and effective library sizes vary across samples. For each gene, the allotetraploid has two homeologs (one A-derived and one B-derived). You can either quantify homeolog-specific counts (using subgenome-aware mapping) or sum the two homeolog counts to the gene level.\n\nYour goal is to detect genes showing non-additive total expression in the allotetraploid that is consistent with dosage compensation. For the purposes of this question, “dosage compensation” means that, despite doubled gene dosage relative to a diploid, the total expression per gene in the allotetraploid remains near the diploid level expected from the parents, rather than doubling. In contrast, “dosage additivity” would produce total expression in the allotetraploid near the sum of the parental expressions.\n\nStarting from first principles appropriate for RNA-seq analysis:\n- Assume gene-level counts follow a negative binomial sampling model with a log link.\n- Assume the expected count in sample $j$ for gene $g$ can be written as $\\mu_{g j} = s_j \\, q_{g j}$, where $s_j$ is a sample-specific normalization factor (e.g., effective library size) and $q_{g j}$ is the underlying expression level on a per-library scale; equivalently, $\\log \\mu_{g j} = \\log s_j + \\eta_{g j}$ with linear predictor $\\eta_{g j}$ determined by group membership.\n- Assume “additivity” at the expression level means that, in the absence of regulatory interaction, the allotetraploid’s total expression per gene would equal the sum of parental per-gene expressions, because gene dosage is doubled (two homeologs) and per-copy transcriptional activity is unchanged. By contrast, “dosage compensation” would lead to allotetraploid total expression similar to the diploid expectation derived from parents (i.e., close to a mid-parent level).\n\nWhich option most appropriately specifies:\n(i) a valid statistical contrast to test for non-additive expression consistent with dosage compensation, and\n(ii) key confounders you must address to avoid false inference in this polyploid context?\n\nChoose the single best option.\n\nA. Fit a gene-wise negative binomial generalized linear model (GLM) with log link and an offset for $\\log s_j$. Use a group factor with levels Parent A, Parent B, and Allotetraploid.

Test the null $H_0: \\beta_{g,\\mathrm{Allo}} - \\frac{1}{2}(\\beta_{g,A} + \\beta_{g,B}) = 0$ via a linear contrast. Genes failing to reject are consistent with dosage compensation, because equality of $\\log$ means to the mid-parent level implies the allotetraploid total expression remains near diploid expectation, whereas dosage additivity would produce $\\log \\mu_{g,\\mathrm{Allo}} \\approx \\log(\\mu_{g,A} + \\mu_{g,B})$, which exceeds the mid-parent when $\\mu_{g,A}, \\mu_{g,B} > 0$. Address confounders by: using homeolog-aware mapping (or validated summation across correctly matched homeologs) to avoid reference bias; including sample-level normalization $s_j$ to control compositional differences; controlling batch and tissue heterogeneity with covariates or blocking; considering External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) spike-ins or cross-sample scaling if absolute transcriptome size differs across ploidy; checking for copy-number variation and collapsed paralogs; and ensuring comparable developmental stage and cell-type composition across groups.\n\nB.

Declare dosage compensation if allotetraploid TPM is significantly lower than this sum. Confounders are unnecessary if read depth is similar, because TPM already normalizes for gene length and library size.\n\nC. Fit a negative binomial GLM with log link and a group factor. Test $H_0: \\beta_{g,\\mathrm{Allo}} - \\beta_{g,A} - \\beta_{g,B} = 0$ as the definition of additivity, and call dosage compensation when the allotetraploid is significantly below this expectation.

The problem describes this as being \"close to a mid-parent level\".\n    - **Dosage Additivity:** Allotetraploid total expression is approximately the sum of the parental expressions, reflecting the doubled gene dosage.\n- **Statistical Model Assumptions:**\n    - Counts follow a negative binomial distribution.\n    - A log-linear model (Generalized Linear Model with log link) is used.\n    - The expected count $\\mu_{g j}$ for gene $g$ in sample $j$ is modeled as $\\log \\mu_{g j} = \\log s_j + \\eta_{g j}$, where $\\log s_j$ is a sample-specific normalization offset and $\\eta_{g j}$ is the linear predictor for the underlying expression level.\n    - The hypothesis of additivity is mathematically stated as the allotetraploid's expression being the sum of parental expressions.\n    - The hypothesis of dosage compensation is stated as the allotetraploid's expression being similar to the \"mid-parent\" diploid level.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard experimental design and analytical challenge in plant polyploid genomics. The use of a negative binomial GLM is the state-of-the-art method for analyzing RNA-seq count data. The definitions of dosage compensation and additivity are standard biological hypotheses in this context. The problem provides sufficient information to formulate a rigorous statistical test and consider relevant confounding factors. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe goal is to test for dosage compensation. According to the problem, this means the allotetraploid's total expression, $q_{\\mathrm{Allo}}$, is close to the mid-parent level, which we can interpret as the average of the parental expression levels, $\\frac{1}{2}(q_A + q_B)$. In contrast, additive expression would be $q_{\\mathrm{Allo}} \\approx q_A + q_B$. We are using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a log link, where the linear predictors $\\eta_A$, $\\eta_B$, and $\\eta_{\\mathrm{Allo}}$ are the logarithms of the respective expression levels: $\\eta = \\log q$.\n\nThe statistical test must be formulated on the log scale. The additive model, $q_{\\mathrm{Allo}} = q_A + q_B$, becomes $\\eta_{\\mathrm{Allo}} = \\log(e^{\\eta_A} + e^{\\eta_B})$. The dosage compensation model, $q_{\\mathrm{Allo}} = \\frac{1}{2}(q_A + q_B)$, becomes $\\eta_{\\mathrm{Allo}} = \\log(\\frac{1}{2}(e^{\\eta_A} + e^{\\eta_B}))$. Neither of these models is linear in the parameters $\\eta_A$ and $\\eta_B$.\n\nHowever, a common and mathematically tractable proxy for the \"mid-parent\" expression on the log scale is the arithmetic mean of the log-expressions: $\\eta_{\\mathrm{Allo}} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\eta_A + \\eta_B)$. This is equivalent to stating that the allotetraploid expression level is the *geometric mean* of the parental expression levels: $q_{\\mathrm{Allo}} = \\sqrt{q_A q_B}$. By the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means, $\\frac{1}{2}(q_A + q_B) \\ge \\sqrt{q_A q_B}$, so these two definitions of \"mid-parent\" are not identical but are often close in practice. Testing against the geometric mean model is a standard approach to identify genes with expression patterns near the mid-parent value.\n\nA proper statistical test would formulate a null hypothesis, $H_0$, that expression is consistent with this mid-parent model:\n$$H_0: \\eta_{\\mathrm{Allo}} - \\frac{1}{2}(\\eta_A + \\eta_B) = 0$$\nThis is a linear contrast of the model parameters and can be readily tested within the GLM framework. If this null hypothesis is not rejected, the gene's expression pattern is considered consistent with dosage compensation. If the contrast is significantly greater than $0$, it suggests expression is higher than the mid-parent level, possibly trending toward the additive model ($q_A + q_B$), as $q_A + q_B > \\sqrt{q_A q_B}$ (for $q_A, q_B > 0$).\n\nFurthermore, any valid analysis of polyploid RNA-seq data must rigorously address numerous potential confounders. These include:\n1.  **Read Mapping Bias:** Reads from one homeolog may preferentially map to the other's reference sequence. This requires a homeolog-aware mapping strategy.\n2.  **Normalization:** Differences in sequencing depth and library composition must be corrected using appropriate normalization factors ($s_j$), incorporated as an offset in the GLM. Standard methods like TMM or DESeq2's median-of-ratios are used for this.\n3.  **Absolute Transcriptome Size:** Ploidy change can alter the total amount of RNA per cell, violating the assumptions of standard normalization procedures. External spike-in controls (like ERCC) can be necessary to account for this.\n4.  **Genomic Integrity:** Post-polyploidization events like gene loss (copy number variation, CNV) can violate the assumption of a $1:1:2$ dosage ratio (Parent A : Parent B : Allotetraploid).\n5.  **Technical and Biological Variability:** Batch effects, developmental stage, and tissue composition must be controlled or randomized.\n\nWith this framework established, we evaluate the options.\n\n**A.

Address confounders by: using homeolog-aware mapping...**\n\n- **(i) Statistical Contrast:** This option correctly proposes using a negative binomial GLM with a log link and a normalization offset, which is the industry standard. It specifies testing the linear contrast for the geometric mean model on the log scale, $H_0: \\eta_{\\mathrm{Allo}} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\eta_A + \\eta_B)$. As derived, this is a standard and valid way to test for expression patterns consistent with a mid-parent value, representing dosage compensation. The interpretation that genes failing to reject this null are consistent with dosage compensation is correct.\n- **(ii) Confounders:** This option provides an exemplary and comprehensive list of critical confounders: reference bias, compositional normalization, absolute transcriptome size changes (ploidy effect), batch/tissue heterogeneity, CNV, and paralog issues. This demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the complexities of polyploid transcriptomics.\n\n**Verdict:** This option is statistically rigorous, biologically relevant, and methodologically thorough. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Convert counts to transcripts per million (TPM) and, for each gene, perform a two-sample $t$-test...**\n\n- **(i) Statistical Contrast:** This approach is deeply flawed. First, transformations like TPM are not suitable for differential expression statistics between samples because the variance is not stabilized and compositional biases are not properly handled. Second, a $t$-test is inappropriate for count data, as it assumes normality and constant variance, which are violated. Third, the low sample size ($n=3$) makes a $t$-test underpowered; count-based GLMs gain power by sharing information across genes to estimate variance. Fourth, comparing $3$ values to a single scalar is not a two-sample $t$-test.\n- **(ii) Confounders:** The claim that confounders are \"unnecessary\" is false and dangerous. TPM does not correct for compositional bias between samples, and it does nothing to address mapping bias, batch effects, or other critical issues.\n\n**Verdict:** This option reflects a profound misunderstanding of RNA-seq data analysis. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Fit a negative binomial GLM... Test $H_0: \\beta_{g,\\mathrm{Allo}} - \\beta_{g,A} - \\beta_{g,B} = 0$...**\n\n- **(i) Statistical Contrast:** The proposed null hypothesis, on the log scale, is $\\eta_{\\mathrm{Allo}} = \\eta_A + \\eta_B$. This back-transforms to $q_{\\mathrm{Allo}} = q_A \\cdot q_B$. This tests if the allotetraploid expression is the *product* of the parental expressions, which has no biological basis in this context. The problem arises from incorrectly assuming that the logarithm of a sum is the sum of logarithms ($\\log(A+B) \\neq \\log A + \\log B$).\n- **(ii) Confounders:** This option falsely claims confounders can be ignored, compounding the error.\n\n**Verdict:** The statistical test is based on a mathematical fallacy and the dismissal of confounders is incorrect. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Average the raw counts across replicates... compute the difference... assess it with a one-sample $z$-test using the Poisson variance...**\n\n- **(i) Statistical Contrast:** This method is invalid. Averaging raw counts before modeling ignores inter-replicate variance and differences in library size, losing critical information. RNA-seq data is overdispersed relative to the Poisson distribution (variance $>$ mean), so using a Poisson-based variance for a $z$-test will severely inflate the rate of false positives. A negative binomial model is required to account for this overdispersion.\n- **(ii) Confounders:** The claim that averaging cancels mapping bias is false. Mapping bias is a systematic error that will persist after averaging.\n\n**Verdict:** This option employs multiple statistically invalid procedures. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Map reads jointly... test whether each homeolog... is downregulated by approximately $50 \\%$... No additional normalization...**\n\n- **(i) Statistical Contrast:** This option proposes testing a specific *mechanism* of dosage compensation (symmetrical downregulation of homeologs) rather than the overall outcome on *total* expression. While a valid scientific question, it is narrower than the stated goal.\n- **(ii) Confounders:** The assertion that \"no additional normalization or confounder control is needed\" is false. Comparing expression of a homeolog in the polyploid to its ortholog in the parent is a between-sample comparison that absolutely requires normalization for library size and composition. Ratios do not eliminate systematic technical artifacts.\n\n**Verdict:** The methodological premise regarding normalization is critically flawed. **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, Option A is the only choice that outlines a correct, rigorous, and comprehensive strategy consistent with modern standards for RNA-seq analysis in polyploids.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2793963"}]}
