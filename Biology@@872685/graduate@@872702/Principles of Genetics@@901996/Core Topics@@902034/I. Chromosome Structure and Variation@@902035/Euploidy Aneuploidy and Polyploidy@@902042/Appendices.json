It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and uses standard, objective terminology from the field of cytogenetics. All necessary information is provided and is internally consistent. We shall proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem provides the cytogenetic notation for an allopolyploid plant: $2n = 4x = 48$. The definitions of the symbols are given as:\n- $2n$: the somatic chromosome number.\n- $n$: the gametic chromosome number, which is the number of chromosomes in a meiotically produced haploid cell (gamete).\n- $x$: the monoploid base number, which is the number of chromosomes in a single fundamental genomic set.\n\nThe notation $4x$ signifies that the organism is tetraploid, meaning its somatic cells contain four monoploid sets of chromosomes. The term \"allopolyploid\" specifies that these sets derive from at least two different ancestral species.\n\nFrom the compound equality $2n = 4x = 48$, we can extract two distinct equations to solve for the two unknowns, $n$ and $x$.\n\nFirst, we use the relationship for the somatic chromosome number:\n$$2n = 48$$\nThis equation directly relates the total chromosome count in a somatic cell ($48$) to the symbol $2n$. The gametic number, $n$, is by definition half of the somatic number. To find $n$, we simply divide by $2$.\n$$n = \\frac{48}{2}$$\n$$n = 24$$\nThus, the gametes of this plant contain $24$ chromosomes.\n\nSecond, we use the relationship for the ploidy level:\n$$4x = 48$$\nThis equation defines the total somatic chromosome count ($48$) in terms of the monoploid base number, $x$. The coefficient $4$ indicates the ploidy level (tetraploid). To find the base number $x$, we divide by $4$.\n$$x = \\frac{48}{4}$$\n$$x = 12$$\nThis indicates that the fundamental genomic set for this polyploid series consists of $12$ chromosomes.\n\nThe results are consistent. The organism is an allotetraploid ($4x$) with a somatic number of $48$. During meiosis, it functions as a diploid, pairing homologous chromosomes from its distinct ancestral genomes. Consequently, it produces gametes that contain two full monoploid sets, making the gametic number $n = 2x = 2 \\times 12 = 24$. This matches our calculation for $n$ from the $2n = 48$ relation.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be presented as a row matrix $(n \\;\\; x)$.

The assumptions provided (normal segregation of other chromosomes, equal viability) ensure a unique solution can be derived.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is precise and unbiased.\nThe problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. The term \"intrameiotic selfing\" is unusual but is explicitly and unambiguously defined within the problem, posing a specific combinatorial challenge rather than an ambiguity. The problem is a valid and rigorous exercise in theoretical genetics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Gamete and Zygote Karyotypes\n\n#### 1. Gamete Karyotypes from Meiosis I Nondisjunction\nLet the homologous pair of chromosome $\\mathsf{C}$ in the diploid parental cell ($2n$) be denoted as $\\mathsf{C_A}$ and $\\mathsf{C_B}$.\nBefore meiosis, DNA replication occurs, so the cell entering Meiosis I contains two replicated homologous chromosomes, each consisting of two sister chromatids. Let's represent these as $(\\mathsf{C_A}, \\mathsf{C_A})$ and $(\\mathsf{C_B}, \\mathsf{C_B})$.\n\n-   **Meiosis I (MI)**: The problem states that nondisjunction of homologous chromosomes occurs. Instead of $\\mathsf{C_A}$ and $\\mathsf{C_B}$ separating, they both migrate to the same pole. The other pole receives no chromosome from pair $\\mathsf{C}$. This results in two secondary meiocytes:\n    -   Meiocyte 1: Contains both replicated homologous chromosomes, $(\\mathsf{C_A}, \\mathsf{C_A})$ and $(\\mathsf{C_B}, \\mathsf{C_B})$. Its chromosome content for the rest of the genome is haploid, $n-1$. So its total chromosome number is $(n-1)+2=n+1$ replicated chromosomes.\n    -   Meiocyte 2: Contains no chromosome $\\mathsf{C}$. Its chromosome content for the rest of the genome is haploid, $n-1$. So its total chromosome number is $(n-1)$ replicated chromosomes.\n\n-   **Meiosis II (MII)**: This division proceeds normally, meaning sister chromatids separate.\n    -   Meiocyte 1 divides. The sister chromatids of $(\\mathsf{C_A}, \\mathsf{C_A})$ and $(\\mathsf{C_B}, \\mathsf{C_B})$ separate. The two resulting gametes each receive one chromatid $\\mathsf{C_A}$ and one chromatid $\\mathsf{C_B}$. They are disomic for chromosome $\\mathsf{C}$. Their overall chromosome number is $n+1$.\n    -   Meiocyte 2 divides. Since it has no chromosome $\\mathsf{C}$, the two resulting gametes also lack chromosome $\\mathsf{C}$. They are nullisomic for chromosome $\\mathsf{C}$. Their overall chromosome number is $n-1$.\n\n-   **Gamete Spectrum**: The single meiotic event with MI nondisjunction produces a set of four gametes:\n    -   $2$ gametes of karyotype $(n+1)$, disomic for $\\mathsf{C}$.\n    -   $2$ gametes of karyotype $(n-1)$, nullisomic for $\\mathsf{C}$.\n\n#### 2. Zygote Karyotypes from Intraneiotic Selfing\nThe problem defines fertilization as \"randomly uniting $2$ gametes sampled without replacement from those $4$ products.\"\nOur set of four gametes is $\\{G_{n+1}^{(1)}, G_{n+1}^{(2)}, G_{n-1}^{(1)}, G_{n-1}^{(2)}\\}$. We must find all possible pairs that can be formed by sampling two without replacement. The total number of unique pairs is given by the combination formula $\\binom{4}{2}$:\n$$ \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6 $$\nThere are $6$ equally likely zygotic combinations, assuming random union and equal viability. We enumerate them based on the gamete karyotypes:\n\n1.  **Fusion of two $(n+1)$ gametes**: There is only $1$ way to choose the two $(n+1)$ gametes, $\\{G_{n+1}^{(1)}, G_{n+1}^{(2)}\\}$.\n    -   Zygote karyotype: $(n+1) + (n+1) = 2n+2$. This is a **tetrasomic** zygote.\n    -   Number of combinations: $1$.\n\n2.  **Fusion of two $(n-1)$ gametes**: There is only $1$ way to choose the two $(n-1)$ gametes, $\\{G_{n-1}^{(1)}, G_{n-1}^{(2)}\\}$.\n    -   Zygote karyotype: $(n-1) + (n-1) = 2n-2$. This is a **nullisomic** zygote.\n    -   Number of combinations: $1$.\n\n3.  **Fusion of one $(n+1)$ gamete and one $(n-1)$ gamete**: We can choose one of the two $(n+1)$ gametes and one of the two $(n-1)$ gametes.\n    -   The possible pairings are $\\{G_{n+1}^{(1)}, G_{n-1}^{(1)}\\}$, $\\{G_{n+1}^{(1)}, G_{n-1}^{(2)}\\}$, $\\{G_{n+1}^{(2)}, G_{n-1}^{(1)}\\}$, and $\\{G_{n+1}^{(2)}, G_{n-1}^{(2)}\\}$.\n    -   Zygote karyotype: $(n+1) + (n-1) = 2n$. This is a **euploid** zygote.\n    -   Number of combinations: $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\n-   **Zygote Proportions**: Out of the $6$ total equally likely combinations:\n    -   **Euploid ($2n$)**: $4$ combinations. Proportion = $4/6 = 2/3$.\n    -   **Monosomy ($2n-1$)**: $0$ combinations. Proportion = $0$.\n    -   **Trisomy ($2n+1$)**: $0$ combinations. Proportion = $0$.\n    -   **Tetrasomy ($2n+2$)**: $1$ combination. Proportion = $1/6$.\n    -   **Nullisomy ($2n-2$)**: $1$ combination. Proportion = $1/6$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Gametes: $2$ of type $(n+1)$ and $2$ of type $(n-1)$. Zygotes: $2/3$ euploid $(2n)$, $1/6$ tetrasomy $(2n+2)$, $1/6$ nullisomy $(2n-2)$; no trisomy $(2n+1)$ or monosomy $(2n-1)$.**\nThis option's description of gamete types is correct. The description of zygote proportions ($2/3$ euploid, $1/6$ tetrasomy, $1/6$ nullisomy) and the absence of monosomy and trisomy perfectly match the derived results.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Gametes: $1$ of type $(n+1)$, $1$ of type $(n-1)$, and $2$ normal $(n)$. Zygotes: $1/2$ trisomy $(2n+1)$ and $1/2$ monosomy $(2n-1)$; no euploid $(2n)$.**\nThe gamete spectrum described, {$(n+1), (n-1), n, n$}, is the characteristic result of a nondisjunction event in Meiosis II, not Meiosis I. Therefore, the premise of this option is incorrect. Furthermore, its calculation of zygote proportions is also flawed, even for the gametes it proposes.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Gametes: $2$ of type $(n+1)$ and $2$ normal $(n)$. Zygotes: $1/4$ euploid $(2n)$, $1/4$ trisomy $(2n+1)$, $1/4$ monosomy $(2n-1)$, $1/4$ tetrasomy $(2n+2)$.**\nThe gamete spectrum is incorrect. It does not correspond to either a standard MI or MII nondisjunction event. The zygote propoertions listed are also inconsistent with the gametes proposed.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Gametes: $2$ of type $(n+1)$ and $2$ of type $(n-1)$. Zygotes: all aneuploid; $1/2$ trisomy $(2n+1)$ and $1/2$ nullisomy $(2n-2)$.**\nThe description of gamete types is correct. However, the description of zygotes is deeply flawed. The claim that all zygotes are aneuploid is false; our derivation shows $2/3$ are euploid. The claim of trisomy ($2n+1$) is impossible, as no combination of $(n+1)$ and $(n-1)$ gametes can sum to $2n+1$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Gametes: $2$ of type $(n+1)$ and $2$ of type $(n-1)$. Zygotes: $1/3$ euploid $(2n)$, $1/3$ trisomy $(2n+1)$, $1/3$ monosomy $(2n-1)$; no tetrasomy $(2n+2)$ or nullisomy $(2n-2)$.**\nThe description of gamete types is correct. However, the zygote proportions are incorrect. It wrongly states a proportion of $1/3$ for euploids, and incorrectly includes trisomy and monosomy, which are impossible outcomes. It also incorrectly excludes tetrasomy and nullisomy, which are the only possible aneuploid outcomes.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2810086"}, {"introduction": "Polyploidy is not a monolithic phenomenon; the evolutionary origin of the extra chromosome sets profoundly impacts an organism's genetics.

Do not round your answer.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of expected progeny segregation ratios for two distinct genetic models—one disomic and one tetrasomic—and the subsequent calculation of a likelihood ratio based on experimental data. I will address each part systematically from first principles.\n\nFirst, we analyze the allopolyploid model with disomic inheritance.\nLet this model be denoted $M_{D}$. The species is an allotetraploid with karyotype $AABB$. The locus in question is specific to the $A$ subgenome and experiences no homoeologous interactions. Inheritance is disomic, which means it follows standard diploid Mendelian genetics.\nThe parental cross is $P_{1} \\times P_{2}$.\nParent $P_{1}$ has genotype $Aa$. Following the law of segregation, meiosis in $P_{1}$ produces two types of gametes, $A$ and $a$, in equal frequencies:\n$$f(A) = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad f(a) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nParent $P_{2}$ has genotype $aa$. It is homozygous and produces only one type of gamete, $a$:\n$$f(a) = 1$$\nThe $F_{1}$ progeny genotypes are determined by the random fusion of gametes from $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$:\n-   Genotype $Aa$: formed from a $P_{1}$ gamete of type $A$ and a $P_{2}$ gamete of type $a$.

The probability is $P(aa) = f(a) \\times f(a) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe expected segregation ratio in the $F_{1}$ generation is $1 Aa : 1 aa$.\nThe problem asks for the probability of observing a progeny that is \"nulliplex for $a$\". In this disomic model, the nulliplex genotype is $aa$. The probability of a single progeny being nulliplex under the disomic model, which we denote $p_{D}$, is:\n$$p_{D} = P(aa) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nNext, we analyze the autopolyploid model with tetrasomic inheritance.\nLet this model be denoted $M_{T}$. The species is an autotetraploid with karyotype $AAAA$. The inheritance is tetrasomic with random bivalent pairing and no double reduction. The condition of \"no double reduction\" simplifies the meiotic model to one of random chromosome segregation, where each diploid gamete receives two chromosomes chosen randomly from the four homologous chromosomes of the parent.\nThe parental cross is $P_{1} \\times P_{2}$.\nParent $P_{1}$ is triplex with genotype $AAAa$. It has $4$ homologous chromosomes, $3$ carrying allele $A$ and $1$ carrying allele $a$. A diploid gamete is formed by randomly selecting $2$ of these $4$ chromosomes. The total number of ways to choose $2$ chromosomes from $4$ is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6$.\nWe calculate the number of ways to form the possible gamete genotypes:\n-   Genotype $AA$: requires choosing $2$ chromosomes with the $A$ allele from the $3$ available. The number of ways is $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$.\n-   Genotype $Aa$: requires choosing $1$ chromosome with the $A$ allele from the $3$ available, and $1$ chromosome with the $a$ allele from the $1$ available.
