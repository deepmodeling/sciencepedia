During meiosis in such a carrier, one Robertsonian derivative and the two homologous normal acrocentrics form a trivalent. Use the following assumptions, which idealize well-established cytogenetic observations:\n\n- The trivalent undergoes alternate segregation with probability $0.60$, producing two balanced classes of haploid ova that are equiprobable under alternate segregation: a cytogenetically normal ovum containing one normal chromosome $14$ and one normal chromosome $21$, and a balanced-carrier ovum containing the Robertsonian derivative $\\mathrm{der}(14;21)$ and neither a normal chromosome $14$ nor a normal chromosome $21$.\n- The trivalent undergoes $3{:}0$ segregation with probability $0.05$.

The given probabilities are idealized but plausible representations of empirical data. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to calculate the requested conditional probability. The set of segregation probabilities is complete and consistent, as they sum to $1$. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe task is to compute the conditional probability that a liveborn child has Down syndrome, given the specified maternal karyotype and meiotic segregation probabilities. Let $DS$ be the event that a liveborn child has Down syndrome, and $LB$ be the event of a live birth. We must calculate $P(DS | LB) = \\frac{P(DS \\cap LB)}{P(LB)}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the probabilities of the different meiotic segregation patterns. Let $P_A$, $P_J$, and $P_{3:0}$ be the probabilities of alternate, adjacent, and $3{:}0$ segregation, respectively.\nWe are given:\n$P_A = 0.60$\n$P_{3:0} = 0.05$\nThe total probability must be $1$, so the probability of adjacent segregation is:\n$$ P_J = 1 - P_A - P_{3:0} = 1 - 0.60 - 0.05 = 0.35 $$\n\nNext, we determine the probability of each type of ovum (gamete) being produced.\n\n1.  **Alternate Segregation**: The total probability is $P_A = 0.60$. This produces two equiprobable classes of viable gametes.\n    -   Normal ovum (one normal chromosome $14$, one normal chromosome $21$):\n        $P(\\text{Normal ovum}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times P_A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.60 = 0.30$.\n    -   Balanced carrier ovum (one $\\mathrm{der}(14;21)$ chromosome):\n        $P(\\text{Balanced carrier ovum}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times P_A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.60 = 0.30$.\n\n2.  **Adjacent Segregation**: The total probability is $P_J = 0.35$. This produces four equiprobable classes of unbalanced gametes. The probability of each is $\\frac{1}{4} \\times P_J = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 0.35 = 0.0875$.\n    -   Ovum with $\\mathrm{der}(14;21) + 21$: $P = 0.0875$.\n    -   Ovum with $\\mathrm{der}(14;21) + 14$: $P = 0.0875$.\n    -   Ovum with only chromosome $14$: $P = 0.0875$.\n    -   Ovum with only chromosome $21$: $P = 0.0875$.\n\n3.  **$3{:}0$ Segregation**: The total probability is $P_{3:0} = 0.05$. By definition, all zygotes resulting from these gametes are nonviable.\n\nNow, we determine the outcomes of fertilization by a normal sperm (containing one normal chromosome $14$ and one normal chromosome $21$) and assess the viability of the resulting zygotes.\n\n-   Zygote from a **Normal ovum**: (normal $14, 21$) + (sperm $14, 21$) $\\rightarrow$ Normal karyotype.

This results in a **live birth**. The probability of this conception is $0.30$.\n-   Zygote from ovum with **$\\mathrm{der}(14;21) + 21$**: ($\\mathrm{der}(14;21), 21$) + (sperm $14, 21$) $\\rightarrow$ This zygote has genetic material equivalent to three copies of chromosome $21$ and two copies of chromosome $14$. This is translocation Down syndrome (Trisomy $21$). This results in a **live birth**. The probability of this conception is $0.0875$.\n-   Zygote from ovum with **$\\mathrm{der}(14;21) + 14$**: ($\\mathrm{der}(14;21), 14$) + (sperm $14, 21$) $\\rightarrow$ Trisomy $14$. This is **lethal**.\n-   Zygote from ovum with **only chromosome $14$**: ($14$) + (sperm $14, 21$) $\\rightarrow$ Monosomy $21$. This is **lethal**.\n-   Zygote from ovum with **only chromosome $21$**: ($21$) + (sperm $14, 21$) $\\rightarrow$ Monosomy $14$. This is **lethal**.\n-   Zygotes from **$3{:}0$ segregation gametes**: All are **lethal**.\n\nThe event of a live birth ($LB$) comprises the three viable outcomes. The total probability of a live birth is the sum of the probabilities of these outcomes:\n$$ P(LB) = P(\\text{Normal}) + P(\\text{Balanced carrier}) + P(\\text{Down syndrome}) $$\n$$ P(LB) = 0.30 + 0.30 + 0.0875 = 0.6875 $$\n\nThe event of a liveborn child having Down syndrome ($DS \\cap LB$) corresponds to the specific viable outcome of Trisomy $21$. Its probability is:\n$$ P(DS \\cap LB) = 0.0875 $$\n\nThe conditional probability of a liveborn child having Down syndrome is therefore:\n$$ P(DS | LB) = \\frac{P(DS \\cap LB)}{P(LB)} = \\frac{0.0875}{0.6875} $$\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we can write the decimal values as fractions over a common denominator:\n$$ \\frac{0.0875}{0.6875} = \\frac{875 / 10000}{6875 / 10000} = \\frac{875}{6875} $$\nWe simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. Both are divisible by $125$.\n$$ \\frac{875 \\div 125}{6875 \\div 125} = \\frac{7}{55} $$\nThis fraction is irreducible as $7$ is a prime number and $55$ is not a multiple of $7$.\nThus, the conditional probability is $\\frac{7}{55}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{7}{55}} $$", "id": "2823336"}, {"introduction": "After an aneuploidy is identified, a critical scientific question is to determine its origin.

The described SNP data pattern is a classic signature used in cytogenetics to determine the origin of aneuploidy, and it is consistent with the correct principles of meiosis stated in the article's main text. The problem is self-contained, objective, and poses a question that is solvable by applying the stated fundamental principles.\n\n**Verdict: The problem is valid.**\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe goal is to determine the meiotic stage (Meiosis $I$ or Meiosis $II$) and parental origin (maternal) of the nondisjunction event. The trio analysis has already established the maternal origin. The key is to distinguish between a Meiosis $I$ (M-I) and Meiosis $II$ (M-II) error by analyzing the pattern of isodisomy versus heterodisomy along the chromosome.\n\n1.  **Scenario 1: Maternal Meiosis I (M-I) Nondisjunction**\n    -   In an M-I error, the homologous chromosomes fail to segregate. Both homologs (each replicated) move to the same secondary oocyte.\n    -   Meiosis II then proceeds, separating sister chromatids. The final ovum receives two non-identical, homologous chromosomes from the mother.\n    -   **Genomic consequence**: For any locus where the mother is heterozygous, the trisomic child will inherit both of her different alleles. This results in **heterodisomy** along the entire length of the chromosome. This contradicts the data, which shows a region of isodisomy.\n\n2.  **Scenario 2: Maternal Meiosis II (M-II) Nondisjunction with a Crossover**\n    -   In this scenario, Meiosis I is normal. A crossover occurs between non-sister chromatids during prophase I. The homologous chromosomes then segregate correctly. The secondary oocyte receives one replicated chromosome.\n    -   **Effect of Crossover**: The crossover event means that the two sister chromatids within this replicated chromosome are no longer identical along their entire length. They remain identical from the centromere to the site of the crossover, but are different (heterozygous) distal to the crossover.\n    -   In an M-II error, these two sister chromatids fail to segregate at anaphase II. Both are passed into the same ovum.\n    -   **Genomic consequence**:\n        -   **Centromeric Region (proximal to crossover)**: In this region, the two sister chromatids were identical. The child inherits two identical copies of this segment from the mother. This is **isodisomy**.\n        -   **Distal Region (distal to crossover)**: In this region, the two sister chromatids carried different alleles due to the crossover. The child inherits these two different versions. This is **heterodisomy**.\n    -   **Conclusion for M-II with crossover**: This mechanism produces **centromeric isodisomy** and **distal heterodisomy**. This pattern perfectly matches the data provided in the problem statement.\n\n**Summary**\nThe observed pattern of centromeric isodisomy transitioning to distal heterodisomy is the characteristic molecular signature of a nondisjunction event during maternal Meiosis $II$ that was preceded by at least one meiotic recombination event between the centromere and the telomere.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Maternal meiosis $I$ nondisjunction, as evidenced by the presence of heterodisomy.**\nThis is incorrect. While M-I errors do produce heterodisomy, they produce it along the entire chromosome. This option fails to account for the observed centromeric isodisomy.\n\n**B. Maternal meiosis $II$ nondisjunction with at least one crossover, as evidenced by centromeric isodisomy and distal heterodisomy tracts.**\nThis option correctly identifies the meiotic stage (Meiosis II), the parental origin (maternal), the necessity of recombination (crossover), and the resulting genomic pattern (centromeric isodisomy and distal heterodisomy). As derived above, this is the only mechanism that fully explains the SNP data.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Paternal meiosis $I$ nondisjunction, because heterodisomy at any point implies both paternal homologs were co-inherited.**\nThis option is contradicted by the trio analysis, which established a maternal origin for the extra chromosome.\n\n**D. Post-zygotic mitotic nondisjunction, because mitotic recombination after fertilization yields distal heterodisomy.**\nMitotic nondisjunction in a diploid zygote would create a trisomic cell line exhibiting complete isodisomy for the extra chromosome. While rare mitotic recombination can occur, it is not the standard mechanism and would not reliably produce the clean, canonical pattern described.

Let $T$ be the event that the screening test yields a positive result. The problem requires the derivation of the Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$), which is the conditional probability $P(D|T)$, from first principles.\n\nThe defining characteristics of the screening test and the population are given as:\n- Sensitivity ($Se$): The probability of a positive test given the presence of the disease. $Se = P(T|D) = 0.99$.\n- Specificity ($Sp$): The probability of a negative test given the absence of the disease. $Sp = P(T^c|D^c) = 0.999$.\n- Prevalence ($P$): The a priori probability of the disease in a given population. $P = P(D)$.

This can be re-expressed using the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(D \\cap T) = P(T|D)P(D) = Se \\cdot P$$\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. By the law of total probability, we can decompose $P(T)$ into the sum of probabilities of two disjoint events: a true positive ($T \\cap D$) and a false positive ($T \\cap D^c$).\n$$P(T) = P(T \\cap D) + P(T \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term:\n$$P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nWe can identify the components:\n- $P(T|D) = Se$.\n- $P(D) = P$.\n- $P(D^c)$ is the probability of not having the disease, which is $1 - P(D) = 1 - P$.\n- $P(T|D^c)$ is the false positive rate. Since a test result must be either positive or negative, $P(T|D^c) + P(T^c|D^c) = 1$. Therefore, $P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - Sp$. In this case, $1 - 0.999 = 0.001$.\n\nSubstituting these components back into the expression for $P(T)$:\n$$P(T) = (Se \\cdot P) + ((1 - Sp)(1 - P))$$\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for the numerator $P(D \\cap T)$ and the denominator $P(T)$ into the original equation for $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot P}{Se \\cdot P + (1 - Sp)(1 - P)}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression, which is an application of Bayes' theorem.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the two specified maternal age strata.\n\nCase 1: Individual aged $25$ years.\nHere, the prevalence is $P_{25} = \\frac{1}{1200}$.\n$$PPV_{25} = \\frac{0.99 \\cdot \\frac{1}{1200}}{0.99 \\cdot \\frac{1}{1200} + (1 - 0.999) \\cdot (1 - \\frac{1}{1200})}$$\n$$PPV_{25} = \\frac{\\frac{0.99}{1200}}{\\frac{0.99}{1200} + 0.001 \\cdot \\frac{1199}{1200}}$$\nTo simplify, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $1200$:\n$$PPV_{25} = \\frac{0.99}{0.99 + 0.001 \\cdot 1199} = \\frac{0.99}{0.99 + 1.199} = \\frac{0.99}{2.189}$$\nThe numerical value is approximately $0.452261...$.
