The first polar body ($PB_1$) is the product of $MI$; the second polar body ($PB_2$) is the product of $MII$.\n-   **Genetic Markers:**\n    -   A centromere-proximal Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) where the mother is heterozygous, with alleles $A$ and $a$.\n    -   A distal SNP on the same chromosome with alleles $B$ and $b$. A single crossover may occur between this locus and the centromere.\n-   **Genotyping Assumptions:**\n    -   Sister chromatids are identical at loci proximal to the centromere (i.e., no crossover between the $A/a$ locus and the centromere).\n    -   Genotyping of $PB_1$ and $PB_2$ can detect the presence of alleles $A, a, B, b$.\n    -   Absence of a locus's alleles indicates nullisomy.\n    -   Presence of both $A$ and $a$ ($A+a$) at the centromere-proximal SNP indicates heterozygosity due to the presence of non-identical chromatids (i.e., homologous chromosomes).\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Problem Statement**\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is based on established principles of meiosis, chromosome segregation, recombination, and the etiology of aneuploidy. Polar body biopsy and genetic analysis are real-world techniques used in reproductive medicine. The premises are scientifically sound and factually correct.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The question is clearly defined. It asks for the logical deduction of allele patterns in polar bodies resulting from specific meiotic errors. The provided information is sufficient to derive a unique and meaningful answer.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and standard scientific terminology, free from ambiguity or subjective interpretation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically valid, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the specified criteria for invalidity. Therefore, I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nLet the maternal homologous chromosomes, after replication, be represented. Homolog $1$ carries allele $A$ at its centromere, and Homolog $2$ carries allele $a$. Thus, Homolog $1$ consists of two sister chromatids, both type $A$, and Homolog $2$ consists of two sister chromatids, both type $a$. The mother is heterozygous $A/a$.\n\nWe analyze the genetic content of $PB_1$ and $PB_2$ under two scenarios of nondisjunction leading to a disomic oocyte (which, upon fertilization, would yield a trisomic zygote).\n\n**Scenario 1: Meiosis I ($MI$) Nondisjunction**\n\nIn $MI$ nondisjunction, the homologous chromosomes fail to segregate. To produce a disomic oocyte, both homologous chromosomes must enter the secondary oocyte, leaving $PB_1$ with no copy of this chromosome.\n\n1.  **Meiosis I:** The homologous chromosomes (the $A$ pair of chromatids and the $a$ pair of chromatids) fail to separate and both are segregated to the secondary oocyte.\n    -   **First Polar Body ($PB_1$):** Receives no chromosome. Its genotype is nullisomic for this chromosome (no $A$ or $a$ allele). This is an abnormal $PB_1$.\n    -   **Secondary Oocyte:** Receives both homologous chromosomes. It is disomic and its DNA content is heterozygous for the centromere-proximal marker ($A+a$).\n\n2.  **Meiosis II:** The secondary oocyte, containing two replicated homologous chromosomes, proceeds to division. Assuming a standard segregation mechanism for the available chromosomes, the sister chromatids of both homologs separate. The oocyte must retain two non-homologous chromatids to be a viable disomic gamete (one with centromere $A$ and one with centromere $a$). The other two chromatids are extruded into $PB_2$.\n    -   **Second Polar Body ($PB_2$):** Receives one chromatid of type $A$ and one of type $a$. It is therefore disomic and heterozygous ($A+a$) for the centromere-proximal marker.\n    -   **Ootid:** Also receives one chromatid of type $A$ and one of type $a$, making it disomic and heterozygous ($A+a$).\n\n*   **Conclusion for $MI$ Nondisjunction:** The key signature is an abnormal $PB_1$ (in this case, nullisomic). This leads to a secondary oocyte that is heterozygous ($A+a$) for the centromere-proximal marker, which in turn produces a $PB_2$ that is also heterozygous ($A+a$). An alternative, less common $MI$ error would send both homologs to $PB_1$, making $PB_1$ heterozygous ($A+a$) and the oocyte nullisomic, which would lead to a monosomic zygote. In either case, the presence of a centromere-proximal heterozygous polar body ($PB_1$ or $PB_2$) or a nullisomic $PB_1$ points to an $MI$ error.\n\n**Scenario 2: Meiosis II ($MII$) Nondisjunction**\n\nIn this case, $MI$ proceeds normally, but the sister chromatids fail to segregate during $MII$.\n\n1.  **Meiosis I:** Homologous chromosomes segregate correctly.\n    -   **First Polar Body ($PB_1$):** Receives one homologous chromosome (e.g., the one with two type $a$ chromatids). Its genotype is therefore homozygous, containing only allele $a$. It appears normal.\n    -   **Secondary Oocyte:** Receives the other homologous chromosome (e.g., the one with two type $A$ chromatids). Its genotype is homozygous, containing only allele $A$.\n\n2.  **Meiosis II:** Nondisjunction of sister chromatids occurs in the secondary oocyte. To produce a disomic oocyte, both sister chromatids must be retained in the ootid.\n    -   **Secondary Oocyte:** Contains one replicated chromosome (type $A$). The two sister chromatids (both type $A$) fail to separate and are both retained by the ootid.\n    -   **Second Polar Body ($PB_2$):** Receives no chromatid. Its genotype is nullisomic.\n    -   **Ootid:** Receives both sister chromatids. It is disomic but homozygous ($AA$) for the centromere-proximal marker.\n\n*   **Conclusion for $MII$ Nondisjunction:** The signature is a normal $PB_1$ (homozygous, e.g., genotype $a$), followed by an abnormal $MII$ division creating an abnormal $PB_2$. This $PB_2$ can be either nullisomic (if the oocyte is disomic) or disomic and homozygous (e.g., genotype $AA$, if the oocyte is nullisomic). Crucially, any disomic polar body arising from an $MII$ error will be homozygous for the centromere-proximal marker.\n\n**Effect of Crossover**\nA crossover between the centromere and the distal $B/b$ locus makes the sister chromatids non-identical for the distal portion (e.g., one chromatid is $A-B$, the other is $A-b$).\n-   In an $MI$ error, the centromere-proximal heterozygosity ($A+a$) in $PB_2$ and the ootid is unaffected. The distal locus in these cells may be heterozygous or homozygous depending on which chromatids segregate together.\n-   In an $MII$ error, if a disomic $PB_2$ is formed, it will still be homozygous for the centromere ($AA$ or $aa$), but it could become heterozygous for the distal marker ($B+b$). This distal heterozygosity does not change the fundamental conclusion based on the centromere-proximal homozygosity.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. MI nondisjunction: PB$1$ is abnormal for the chromosome in question (either nullisomic with no $A/a$ or disomic and heterozygous $A$+$a$ at the centromere-proximal SNP); PB$2$ becomes disomic and heterozygous $A$+$a$ at the centromere-proximal SNP if the oocyte carried both homologs into MII. Distally, PB$2$ can be heterozygous $B$+$b$ or show recombinant configurations depending on crossover, but centromere-proximal heterozygosity is retained. MII nondisjunction: PB$1$ appears normal (carries a single homolog’s allele, either $A$ or $a$); PB$2$ is either nullisomic for the chromosome (no $A/a$) or disomic but centromere-proximal homozygous (two sister chromatids, hence only $A$ or only $a$). Distal heterozygosity in PB$2$ arises only if a crossover occurred between the distal SNP and the centromere.**\n\n-   This option correctly describes the outcomes for $MI$ nondisjunction: $PB_1$ is abnormal (nullisomic or heterozygous $A+a$). It correctly states that if the oocyte is disomic heterozygous entering $MII$, the resulting $PB_2$ will also be heterozygous $A+a$. The statement about the distal SNP is also correct.\n-   This option correctly describes the outcomes for $MII$ nondisjunction: $PB_1$ is normal (homozygous for the centromeric marker). $PB_2$ is abnormal (either nullisomic or disomic and homozygous). The statement about the origin of distal heterozygosity in a disomic $PB_2$ (requiring a crossover) is also correct.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. MI nondisjunction: PB$1$ appears normal (single allele at both SNPs), while PB$2$ is nullisomic for the chromosome; MII nondisjunction: PB$1$ is disomic and heterozygous $A$+$a$ at the centromere-proximal SNP, while PB$2$ is disomic and heterozygous $A$+$a$ irrespective of recombination.**\n\n-   This option incorrectly states that $PB_1$ is normal in $MI$ nondisjunction. A normal $PB_1$ is a hallmark of normal $MI$ segregation. It also incorrectly attributes the signature of $MI$ error (heterozygous $PB_1$) to $MII$ error.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. MI nondisjunction always produces centromere-proximal homozygosity in whichever polar body is disomic (two identical alleles, only $A$ or only $a$), whereas MII nondisjunction always produces centromere-proximal heterozygosity $A$+$a$ in the disomic polar body; distal SNP patterns are uninformative.**\n\n-   This option completely reverses the logic. $MI$ errors produce heterozygosity ($A+a$) in disomic cells because they contain homologous chromosomes. $MII$ errors produce homozygosity ($AA$ or $aa$) in disomic cells because they contain identical (or near-identical) sister chromatids.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. MI and MII nondisjunction cannot be distinguished by polar body genotyping because recombination obscures all signatures; the allele patterns in PB$1$ and PB$2$ are expected to be the same in both cases regardless of centromere proximity or crossover history.**\n\n-   This option makes a false claim. The entire purpose of using a centromere-proximal marker is that its segregation pattern is not obscured by recombination events occurring distally. The analysis above clearly shows that the allele patterns in $PB_1$ and $PB_2$ are distinct for $MI$ vs. $MII$ errors.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. MI nondisjunction: PB$2$ is nullisomic at both SNPs while PB$1$ is disomic and centromere-proximal homozygous (only $A$ or only $a$); MII nondisjunction: PB$1$ is disomic and heterozygous $A$+$a$ at the centromere-proximal SNP, PB$2$ is disomic and heterozygous regardless of crossover.**\n\n-   This option incorrectly describes the pattern for $MI$ nondisjunction; a homozygous $PB_1$ is characteristic of normal $MI$. It then assigns the signature of an $MI$ error (heterozygous $PB_1$) to an $MII$ error. The logic is completely confounded.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2832403"}, {"introduction": "Nondisjunction is not an abstract event, but the result of failures in the physical machinery of chromosome segregation.

You may omit additive constants that do not depend on the origin $O$ (e.g., the $\\log \\binom{n}{k}$ term in the binomial and the $\\log(K!)$ term in the Poisson) since they cancel in the posterior ratio.\n\nTest suite:\nProvide a program that implements the above classifier and applies it to the following six samples, each specified as a tuple $(n, k, L, K)$:\n\n1. $(100, 85, 40, 2)$\n2. $(100, 20, 3, 0)$\n3. $(100, 50, 10, 1)$\n4. $(100, 30, 50, 0)$\n5. $(100, 80, 2, 3)$\n6. $(50, 25, 1, 0)$\n\nRequired final output format:\n- Produce a single line of output containing the classifications for the six samples as a comma-separated list of integers enclosed in square brackets. Use $0$ to denote MI and $1$ to denote MII. For example, a valid output would be of the form $[c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4,c_5,c_6]$ where each $c_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$.", "solution": "The problem presented is a valid, well-posed exercise in Bayesian classification rooted in the principles of statistical genetics. It is scientifically grounded, free of contradictions, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution. I will proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe objective is to classify each sample, described by the data $D = (n, k, L, K)$, as originating from Meiosis I (MI) or Meiosis II (MII) non-disjunction. The classification rule is to select MII if its posterior probability is greater than or equal to $0.5$, i.e., $P(\\mathrm{MII} \\mid D) \\ge 0.5$, and MI otherwise.\n\nThis inequality is equivalent to comparing the posterior probabilities:\n$$P(\\mathrm{MII} \\mid D) \\ge P(\\mathrm{MI} \\mid D)$$\nUsing Bayes' theorem, $P(O \\mid D) = \\frac{P(D \\mid O)P(O)}{P(D)}$, where $O \\in \\{\\mathrm{MI}, \\mathrm{MII}\\}$. Since the denominator $P(D)$ is common to both posteriors, the inequality simplifies to a comparison of the numerators:\n$$P(D \\mid \\mathrm{MII})P(\\mathrm{MII}) \\ge P(D \\mid \\mathrm{MI})P(\\mathrm{MI})$$\nTo manage the product of probabilities and avoid numerical underflow, it is standard practice to work with log-probabilities. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, the classification rule becomes:\n$$\\log(P(D \\mid \\mathrm{MII})) + \\log(P(\\mathrm{MII})) \\ge \\log(P(D \\mid \\mathrm{MI})) + \\log(P(\\mathrm{MI}))$$\nLet us define a score $S_O$ for each origin $O$ as the log-posterior-proportional term:\n$$S_O = \\log P(O) + \\log P(D \\mid O)$$\nThe rule is to classify the sample as MII if $S_{\\mathrm{MII}} \\ge S_{\\mathrm{MI}}$, and as MI otherwise.\n\nThe problem states that given the origin $O$, the features $k$, $L$, and $K$ are conditionally independent. Thus, the log-likelihood $\\log P(D \\mid O)$ can be expressed as the sum of the individual log-likelihoods:\n$$\\log P(D \\mid O) = \\log P(k \\mid n, O) + \\log P(L \\mid O) + \\log P(K \\mid O)$$\n\nAs specified, we can omit terms in the log-likelihoods that are constant with respect to the origin $O$, as they cancel out in the comparison of scores. Let's define the components of the score for each feature:\n\n1.  **Homozygosity Count ($k$)**: The distribution is $k \\mid n, O \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n, \\theta_O)$. The probability mass function (PMF) is $P(k \\mid n, O) = \\binom{n}{k} \\theta_O^k (1-\\theta_O)^{n-k}$.\n    The log-likelihood is $\\log P(k \\mid n, O) = \\log\\binom{n}{k} + k\\log(\\theta_O) + (n-k)\\log(1-\\theta_O)$.\n    The term $\\log\\binom{n}{k}$ is independent of $O$ and can be dropped. The relevant component is:\n    $$\\log \\mathcal{L}_k(O) = k\\log(\\theta_O) + (n-k)\\log(1-\\theta_O)$$\n\n2.  **Longest Run of Homozygosity ($L$)**: The distribution is $L \\mid O \\sim \\mathrm{Geometric}(q_O)$ on $\\{1, 2, \\dots\\}$. The PMF is $P(L \\mid O) = q_O(1-q_O)^{L-1}$.\n    The log-likelihood is:\n    $$\\log \\mathcal{L}_L(O) = \\log(q_O) + (L-1)\\log(1-q_O)$$\n\n3.  **Crossover Count ($K$)**: The distribution is $K \\mid O \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(\\mu_O)$. The PMF is $P(K \\mid O) = \\frac{e^{-\\mu_O}\\mu_O^K}{K!}$.\n    The log-likelihood is $\\log P(K \\mid O) = -\\mu_O + K\\log(\\mu_O) - \\log(K!)$.\n    The term $\\log(K!)$ is independent of $O$ and can be dropped. The relevant component is:\n    $$\\log \\mathcal{L}_K(O) = -\\mu_O + K\\log(\\mu_O)$$\n    Note that if $K=0$, this term correctly evaluates to $-\\mu_O$.\n\nCombining these components, the total score for origin $O$ is:\n$$S_O = \\log P(O) + \\log \\mathcal{L}_k(O) + \\log \\mathcal{L}_L(O) + \\log \\mathcal{L}_K(O)$$\n\nThe parameters provided are:\n-   **Priors**: $P(\\mathrm{MI}) = 0.6$, $P(\\mathrm{MII}) = 0.4$.\n-   **MI Parameters**: $\\theta_{\\mathrm{MI}} = 0.2$, $q_{\\mathrm{MI}} = 0.25$, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{MI}} = 0.8$.\n-   **MII Parameters**: $\\theta_{\\mathrm{MII}} = 0.8$, $q_{\\mathrm{MII}} = 0.07$, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{MII}} = 1.6$.\n\nFor each test sample $(n, k, L, K)$, we will compute $S_{\\mathrm{MI}}$ and $S_{\\mathrm{MII}}$ and apply the decision rule. A classification of MI will be coded as $0$ and MII as $1$.\n\nExample Calculation for Sample 1: $(n, k, L, K)=(100, 85, 40, 2)$\n\n**Score for MI:**\n$S_{\\mathrm{MI}} = \\log(0.6) + [85\\log(0.2) + (100-85)\\log(0.8)] + [\\log(0.25) + (40-1)\\log(0.75)] + [-0.8 + 2\\log(0.8)]$\n$S_{\\mathrm{MI}} \\approx -0.5108 + [85(-1.6094) + 15(-0.2231)] + [-1.3863 + 39(-0.2877)] + [-0.8 + 2(-0.2231)]$\n$S_{\\mathrm{MI}} \\approx -0.5108 - 140.15 - 12.61 - 1.25 \\approx -154.52$\n\n**Score for MII:**\n$S_{\\mathrm{MII}} = \\log(0.4) + [85\\log(0.8) + (100-85)\\log(0.2)] + [\\log(0.07) + (40-1)\\log(0.93)] + [-1.6 + 2\\log(1.6)]$\n$S_{\\mathrm{MII}} \\approx -0.9163 + [85(-0.2231) + 15(-1.6094)] + [-2.6593 + 39(-0.0726)] + [-1.6 + 2(0.4700)]$\n$S_{\\mathrm{MII}} \\approx -0.9163 - 43.11 - 5.49 - 0.66 \\approx -50.18$\n\nSince $S_{\\mathrm{MII}} (-50.18) \\ge S_{\\mathrm{MI}} (-154.52)$, the classification for sample 1 is MII ($1$).
