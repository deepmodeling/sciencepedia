The task is to derive the two-locus genotype frequencies in the F2 generation and then compute the expected pre-selection fraction of incompatible individuals.\n\nValidation:\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, relying on the established Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model and fundamental principles of Mendelian genetics. It is well-posed, providing all necessary assumptions (parental genotypes, unlinked loci, random mating, etc.) to derive a unique, meaningful solution. The terminology is precise and objective. The problem is a standard exercise in population and evolutionary genetics, and it contains no logical contradictions, scientific inaccuracies, or ambiguities. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nSolution Derivation:\nThe process begins with the parental cross ($P$ generation) and proceeds to the second filial generation ($F2$).\n\nStep 1: Parental Cross and F1 Generation\nThe parental cross is between an individual from Lineage $1$ and an individual from Lineage $2$:\n$$P: AA\\,bb \\times aa\\,BB$$\nThe individual of genotype $AA\\,bb$ produces only one type of gamete: $Ab$.\nThe individual of genotype $aa\\,BB$ produces only one type of gamete: $aB$.\nThe fusion of these gametes produces the first filial generation ($F1$), where all individuals are heterozygous at both loci:\n$$F1 \\text{ genotype}: Aa\\,Bb$$\n\nStep 2: F1 Intercross and F2 Generation Gametes\nThe $F2$ generation is produced by intercrossing the $F1$ individuals:\n$$F1 \\text{ intercross}: Aa\\,Bb \\times Aa\\,Bb$$\nDue to Mendelian segregation and the principle of independent assortment for unlinked loci, an individual of genotype $Aa\\,Bb$ produces four types of gametes in equal proportions. The frequency of each gamete type is $\\frac{1}{4}$:\n$$\n\\text{Gamete frequencies from F1}: P(AB) = \\frac{1}{4}, P(Ab) = \\frac{1}{4}, P(aB) = \\frac{1}{4}, P(ab) = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nThe allele frequencies in this gamete pool are $p_A = P(A) = \\frac{1}{2}$, $q_a = P(a) = \\frac{1}{2}$, $p_B = P(B) = \\frac{1}{2}$, and $q_b = P(b) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nStep 3: Genotype Frequencies in the F2 Generation\nWith random mating (equivalent to the random fusion of these gametes), the genotype frequencies at each locus will follow the Hardy-Weinberg proportions.\nFor locus $A$, the genotype frequencies are:\n$$P(AA) = (p_A)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n$$P(Aa) = 2 p_A q_a = 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$P(aa) = (q_a)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nSimilarly, for locus $B$, the genotype frequencies are:\n$$P(BB) = (p_B)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n$$P(Bb) = 2 p_B q_b = 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$P(bb) = (q_b)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nBecause the loci assort independently, the frequency of any two-locus genotype is the product of the corresponding single-locus genotype frequencies. This constitutes the derivation of the two-locus genotype distribution requested by the problem.\n\nStep 4: Calculation of the Incompatible Fraction\nThe problem defines the incompatible class as individuals with the phenotype $A\\_B\\_$, meaning they possess at least one derived allele $A$ and at least one derived allele $B$. We must calculate the expected fraction of $F2$ individuals belonging to this class. This is the probability $P(A\\_B\\_)$.\nThe probability of an individual having at least one $A$ allele, denoted $P(A\\_)$, is the sum of the probabilities of being $AA$ or $Aa$:\n$$P(A\\_) = P(AA) + P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nAlternatively, this can be calculated as $1$ minus the probability of being homozygous for the ancestral allele $a$:\n$$P(A\\_) = 1 - P(aa) = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nSimilarly, the probability of an individual having at least one $B$ allele, $P(B\\_)$, is:\n$$P(B\\_) = P(BB) + P(Bb) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nOr, equivalently:\n$$P(B\\_) = 1 - P(bb) = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nSince the loci are unlinked, the joint probability of having both phenotypes is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(A\\_B\\_) = P(A\\_) \\times P(B\\_)$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$P(A\\_B\\_) = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{9}{16}$$\nThis is the expected fraction of $F2$ individuals that exhibit the BDM incompatibility before any selection acts upon them.

Population 1 is fixed for genotype $A_{2}A_{2}\\,B_{1}B_{1}$ and population 2 is fixed for genotype $A_{1}A_{1}\\,B_{2}B_{2}$. Assume a single pairwise DMI arises specifically between the two derived alleles $A_{2}$ and $B_{2}$, such that when both are expressed in the same individual they reduce viability by a factor $s$, where $s \\in (0,1)$, relative to a baseline viability of $1$ in the absence of the incompatibility.\n\nCross the two populations to form the F1. Assume standard Mendelian inheritance with no segregation distortion, random mating, and that viability selection acts after zygote formation. Let the dominance of the derived allele at each locus in heterozygotes be quantified by a dominance coefficient: $h_{A}$ for $A_{2}$ in genotype $A_{1}/A_{2}$, and $h_{B}$ for $B_{2}$ in genotype $B_{1}/B_{2}$.

The use of a selection coefficient $s$ and dominance coefficients $h$ to quantify fitness effects is standard practice in population genetics theory. The premises are scientifically sound and factually correct.\n- **Well-Posedness and Completeness**: The problem provides all necessary information to derive a unique solution. The genotypes of the parental populations, the nature of the cross, the specific allelic interaction, and the definition of dominance are all clearly specified.\n- **Objectivity and Clarity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. The terms used (e.g., 'allopatric', 'fixed', 'dominance coefficient') have unambiguous, standard definitions in genetics. The phrasing \"reduce viability by a factor $s$\" is a common, if slightly imprecise, way to state that the fitness is reduced by an amount proportional to $s$. The most logical and standard interpretation in this context is that the selection coefficient against the incompatible phenotype is $s$, resulting in a relative viability of $1-s$.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-posed, scientifically-grounded problem in theoretical population genetics. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe solution is derived as follows.\n\nFirst, we determine the genotype of the $F_1$ generation. The parental cross is between Population $1$ (genotype $A_{2}A_{2}\\,B_{1}B_{1}$) and Population $2$ (genotype $A_{1}A_{1}\\,B_{2}B_{2}$).\nPopulation $1$ produces only one type of gamete: $A_{2}B_{1}$.\nPopulation $2$ produces only one type of gamete: $A_{1}B_{2}$.\nThe fusion of these gametes results in zygotes for the $F_1$ generation. Therefore, all $F_1$ individuals are uniform in genotype, possessing the double heterozygous genotype $A_{1}A_{2}\\,B_{1}B_{2}$.\n\nNext, we determine the viability, $W$, of this $F_1$ genotype. The baseline viability is $1$. A reduction in viability occurs due to the DMI between alleles $A_{2}$ and $B_{2}$. The problem states that this incompatibility requires the \"concurrent expression of both derived changes\".\n\nWe model the expression level of a derived allele in a heterozygote as being proportional to its dominance coefficient.\n- The effective expression of the derived allele $A_{2}$ in the heterozygote $A_{1}A_{2}$ is scaled by $h_{A}$. A value of $h_{A}=1$ corresponds to the full expression level seen in an $A_{2}A_{2}$ homozygote, while $h_{A}=0$ means no expression of the $A_{2}$ phenotype.\n- Similarly, the effective expression of the derived allele $B_{2}$ in the heterozygote $B_{1}B_{2}$ is scaled by $h_{B}$.\n\nThe negative fitness effect of the DMI arises from the interaction of the products of alleles $A_{2}$ and $B_{2}$. A standard and simple model for such an epistatic interaction is to assume the magnitude of the negative effect is proportional to the product of the expression levels of the interacting alleles. The maximum selective disadvantage, which would occur if both derived alleles were fully expressed (as in a hypothetical $A_{2}A_{2}\\,B_{2}B_{2}$ individual), is given by the parameter $s$.\n\nTherefore, the selective disadvantage for the $F_1$ heterozygote ($A_{1}A_{2}\\,B_{1}B_{2}$) is the maximum disadvantage $s$ scaled by the product of the effective dominance coefficients, $h_{A}h_{B}$.\nThe viability of an $F_1$ individual, $W_{F_1}$, is thus:\n$$W_{F_1} = 1 - s \\cdot h_{A} \\cdot h_{B}$$\n\nSince all individuals in the $F_1$ generation have this genotype, the mean viability of the $F_1$ generation, $\\bar{W}_{F_1}$, is equal to the viability of this single genotype:\n$$\\bar{W}_{F_1} = 1 - s h_{A} h_{B}$$\n\nNow, we must evaluate this expression for the nine specified combinations of dominance classes, where \"dom\" corresponds to $h=1$, \"rec\" to $h=0$, and \"cod\" to $h=\\frac{1}{2}$.

Formulation of the Posterior Distribution**\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability mass function (PMF) for $k$ is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior:\n$$ P(k \\mid x, \\lambda, n, q) \\propto P(x \\mid k, n, q) \\cdot P(k \\mid \\lambda) $$\nThe components are:\n- The prior, $P(k \\mid \\lambda)$, is the Poisson PMF:\n  $$ P(k) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^k}{k!} \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\} $$\n- The likelihood, $P(x \\mid k, n, q)$, is the Binomial PMF:\n  $$ P(x \\mid k) = \\binom{n}{x} p(k)^x (1 - p(k))^{n-x} $$\n  where $p(k) = 1 - (1-q)^k$ and consequently, the viability probability is $1-p(k) = (1-q)^k$.\n\nFor numerical computation, it is standard practice to work with logarithms to prevent floating-point underflow or overflow. The unnormalized log-posterior, denoted $\\log \\tilde{P}(k \\mid x)$, is the sum of the log-prior and the log-likelihood:\n$$ \\log \\tilde{P}(k \\mid x) = \\log P(x \\mid k) + \\log P(k) $$\nExpanding these terms, we have:\n$$ \\log P(k) = -\\lambda + k \\log(\\lambda) - \\log(k!) $$\n$$ \\log P(x \\mid k) = \\log\\left(\\binom{n}{x}\\right) + x \\log(p(k)) + (n-x) \\log(1 - p(k)) $$\nSubstituting $p(k) = 1 - (1-q)^k$ and $\\log(1-p(k)) = k \\log(1-q)$:\n$$ \\log \\tilde{P}(k \\mid x) = \\left( \\log\\left(\\binom{n}{x}\\right) - \\lambda \\right) + x\\log(1 - (1-q)^k) + (n-x)k\\log(1-q) + k\\log(\\lambda) - \\log(k!) $$\nThe term $\\log(k!)$ is computed efficiently using the log-gamma function, $\\log(k!) = \\operatorname{gammaln}(k+1)$.

Numerical Computation Algorithm**\n\nThe posterior distribution for $k$ does not have a simple closed-form solution and must be computed numerically over its support, which is the set of non-negative integers $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\n\n**Step 2.1: Truncation of Posterior Support**\nThe support of $k$ is infinite. For computation, we must truncate it at a sufficiently large integer $k_{\\max}$ such that the neglected posterior probability $\\Pr(K  k_{\\max} \\mid x)$ is negligible. The problem specifies a conservative choice for $k_{\\max}$:\n$$ k_{\\max} = \\max\\left\\{\\lceil \\lambda + 15\\sqrt{\\lambda} + 50 \\rceil, 1000\\right\\} $$\nWe will evaluate the posterior for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, k_{\\max}\\}$.\n\n**Step 2.2: Evaluation of Log-Posterior**\nWe compute the vector of unnormalized log-posterior probabilities, `log_post`, for each $k$ in the range $[0, k_{\\max}]$. Special care is required for the edge case $k=0$, where $p(0)=0$:\n- If $k=0$ and $x=0$, the likelihood is $\\binom{n}{0}0^0(1-0)^n = 1$, so the log-likelihood is $0$.\n- If $k=0$ and $x  0$, the likelihood is $0$, so the log-likelihood is $-\\infty$.\n\n**Step 2.3: Normalization**\nTo obtain the normalized posterior PMF, we must convert from log-probabilities to probabilities and ensure they sum to $1$. The standard and numerically stable \"log-sum-exp\" trick is employed:\n1. Find the maximum value of the computed unnormalized log-posteriors: $L_{\\max} = \\max_k(\\log \\tilde{P}(k \\mid x))$.\n2. Compute shifted log-posteriors: $\\log \\tilde{P}'(k \\mid x) = \\log \\tilde{P}(k \\mid x) - L_{\\max}$.\n3.

The normalization constant is the sum of these probabilities: $C = \\sum_{k=0}^{k_{\\max}} \\tilde{P}'(k \\mid x)$.\n5. The final, normalized PMF is $P(k \\mid x) = \\tilde{P}'(k \\mid x) / C$.\n\n**Step 2.4: Credible Interval Calculation**\nThe $(1-\\alpha)$ equal-tailed credible interval $[k_{\\text{lo}}, k_{\\text{hi}}]$ is determined from the posterior cumulative distribution function (CDF), $F(k) = \\Pr(K \\le k \\mid x)$. The CDF is computed by taking the cumulative sum of the normalized PMF. The interval bounds are the smallest integers satisfying:\n- $\\Pr(K \\le k_{\\text{lo}} \\mid x) \\ge \\alpha/2$\n- $\\Pr(K \\le k_{\\text{hi}} \\mid x) \\ge 1 - \\alpha/2$\nThese values are found by searching for the first index in the CDF array that meets or exceeds the respective probability thresholds $\\alpha/2$ and $1 - \\alpha/2$.\n\nThis complete algorithm is implemented in the Python program below to solve for the provided test cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import gammaln\n\ndef calculate_credible_interval(lambda_val, n, x, q, alpha):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the (1-alpha) credible interval for k using Bayesian inference.\n    \n    Args:\n        lambda_val (float): The rate parameter of the Poisson prior for k.\n        n (int): The total number of hybrids tested.\n        x (int): The number of inviable hybrids observed.\n        q (float): The probability that a single DMI manifests.\n        alpha (float): The significance level for the credible interval.\n        \n    Returns:\n        list: A two-element list [k_lo, k_hi] representing the credible interval.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
