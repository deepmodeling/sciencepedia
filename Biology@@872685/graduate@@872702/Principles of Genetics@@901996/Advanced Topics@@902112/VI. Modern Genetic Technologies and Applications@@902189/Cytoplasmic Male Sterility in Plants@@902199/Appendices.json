The solution rests upon two fundamental principles of genetics: the maternal inheritance of cytoplasmic genomes (such as the mitochondrial genome where CMS traits are often encoded) and the Mendelian segregation of nuclear genes.\n\nLet us denote the CMS cytoplasm by $[C]$ and the normal cytoplasm by $[N]$. The nuclear genotype is determined by a single locus with two alleles, a dominant restorer allele $R$ and a recessive non-restorer allele $r$. Both parental plants have the heterozygous nuclear genotype $Rr$.\n\nThe problem states the following rules for phenotype expression:\n1.  In CMS cytoplasm $[C]$, genotypes $RR$ and $Rr$ are male fertile, while genotype $rr$ is male sterile.\n2.  In normal cytoplasm $[N]$, all genotypes ($RR$, $Rr$, and $rr$) are male fertile.\n\nThe inheritance of cytoplasm is strictly maternal, meaning all offspring from a given cross inherit the cytoplasm of the female parent exclusively. The nuclear genes segregate according to Mendelian principles. A cross between two $Rr$ individuals, assuming no meiotic drive and equal zygotic viability, produces offspring with nuclear genotypes in the expected ratio of $1RR : 2Rr : 1rr$.

Thus, any plant genotype containing at least one copy of the dominant $Rf$ allele is male-fertile; only the homozygous $rf/rf$ genotype is male-sterile.\n\n3. Mendelian segregation at a single nuclear locus under self-pollination of a heterozygote yields the $1:2:1$ genotype ratio $Rf/Rf : Rf/rf : rf/rf$ in the offspring, provided there is no segregation distortion and random union of gametes.\n\nSet up the cross and the $F_{1}$:\n\n- The seed parent has CMS cytoplasm and nuclear genotype $rf/rf$.\n- The pollen parent is $Rf/rf$ with normal cytoplasm.\n\nBecause the cytoplasm is maternally inherited, all $F_{1}$ carry the CMS cytoplasm. The nuclear genotypes among $F_{1}$ are determined by the union of female gametes (all $rf$) with male gametes ($Rf$ or $rf$ in equal proportion). Therefore, among the $F_{1}$, half are $Rf/rf$ and half are $rf/rf$.

Such an $F_{1}$ must be $Rf/rf$. Under sporophytic restoration, this $Rf/rf$ plant produces fully functional pollen, and there is no differential viability among its haploid gametes with respect to $Rf$ versus $rf$.

In this species, anther development includes a tapetum that is a diploid ($2n$) sporophytic tissue providing essential metabolites, enzymes, and wall precursors to the haploid ($n$) microspores. In this CMS system, careful histology shows that the first detectable defects occur in the tapetum, not in the microspore itself, and that microspore abortion follows.

Cytoplasmic Male Sterility (CMS), its maternal inheritance via mitochondria, the role of the diploid sporophytic tapetum in nourishing haploid microspores, and the concept of Restorer-of-fertility (Rf) genes are all standard and well-documented phenomena.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The question asks for a causal explanation of a specific observation based on a defined set of biological principles.

The problem is free of subjective or ambiguous language.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The information provided is self-consistent and sufficient. It correctly establishes that: ($1$) the cytoplasm is inherited from the maternal parent; ($2$) the tapetum is sporophytic tissue and thus has the maternal cytoplasm; ($3$) the genetic defect (CMS) expresses in the tapetum; and ($4$) the tapetum is essential for pollen development. These points logically connect to the observed outcome of universal pollen failure.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent question in classical and developmental genetics. I will now proceed to derive the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution from First Principles**\n\nThe problem concerns a phenomenon determined by the interaction between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and the developmental relationship between different tissues. The principles are as follows:\n\n$1$. **Cytoplasmic Inheritance:** The CMS trait is due to factors in the mitochondrial genome. In most angiosperms, cytoplasm, including mitochondria and chloroplasts, is inherited almost exclusively from the female parent (maternal inheritance). Therefore, all cells of the progeny plant, which constitutes the sporophyte generation, will have the cytoplasm of the maternal parent.\n\n$2$. **Sporophyte and Gametophyte Generations:** The main plant body is the diploid ($2n$) sporophyte. Through meiosis, it produces haploid ($n$) spores (microspores for male, megaspores for female), which develop into the gametophyte generation. The pollen grain is the mature male gametophyte. The tapetum is a nutritive layer within the anther and is part of the diploid ($2n$) sporophyte.\n\n$3$. **Site of Gene/Trait Expression:** A trait can be controlled sporophytically or gametophytically.\n    - **Sporophytic control:** The phenotype of the gametophyte (pollen) is determined by the genotype/cytotype of the diploid sporophyte parent.\n    - **Gametophytic control:** The phenotype of the gametophyte (pollen) is determined by its own haploid genotype.\n\n$4$. **Analysis of the Presented System:**\n    - The plant line has CMS cytoplasm. Due to maternal inheritance, the entire sporophyte, including the anther and its tapetum tissue, possesses this CMS cytoplasm.\n    - The problem states that the first detectable defect occurs in the tapetum. This means the CMS trait manifests itself at the sporophytic level. The diploid ($2n$) tapetal cells, containing the CMS mitochondria, become dysfunctional.\n    - The tapetum's function is critical: it nourishes the developing microspores. A defective tapetum fails to provide the necessary substances for microspore viability, maturation, and the formation of the outer pollen wall (exine).\n    - All microspores within an anther, regardless of their individual haploid nuclear genotype resulting from meiotic segregation, are dependent on the same surrounding tapetal tissue.\n    - Consequently, if the tapetum fails, all microspores it is supposed to nourish will be inviable. They will starve or fail to develop properly, leading to their abortion. This effect is **non-cell-autonomous** because the defect in one tissue type (the tapetum) causes the failure of another tissue type (the microspores).\n    - The fact that some pollen grains have a \"normal\" nuclear genotype is irrelevant. The pollen's own nuclear genes cannot compensate for the catastrophic failure of its external support environment. The phenotype (sterility) is imposed by the sporophyte.\n\nThis chain of reasoning leads to the conclusion that the universal non-functionality of pollen is caused by the sporophytic expression of CMS in the tapetum, which fails to support any of the developing microspores.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Because the male-sterile phenotype is imposed by the $2n$ tapetum harboring the CMS mitochondria, which non-cell-autonomously controls nutrient and wall-precursor supply to all developing $n$ microspores; thus, the haploid nuclear genotype of individual pollen cannot compensate for a defective tapetal environment.**\nThis option accurately synthesizes all the key elements of the analysis. It correctly identifies the diploid ($2n$) sporophytic tapetum as the site of CMS mitochondrial action, the non-cell-autonomous nature of the control, the physiological basis of the failure (disrupted supply of nutrients and precursors), and the resulting impotence of the pollen's own haploid ($n$) nuclear genotype. This is a complete and precise explanation of sporophytic CMS.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because microspores inherit mitochondria paternally, those with normal nuclei are incompatible with the maternal CMS cytoplasm and therefore abort.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The problem explicitly states CMS is a \"maternally inherited mitochondrial condition.\" Furthermore, cytoplasmic inheritance in the vast majority of angiosperms is maternal, not paternal. The premise of this option contradicts both the problem statement and established biological fact.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Because normal nuclear genotypes in pollen trigger self-incompatibility responses that reject “self” pollen before pollen maturation, rendering them nonfunctional.**\nThis option incorrectly introduces the concept of self-incompatibility (SI). SI is a mechanism to prevent self-fertilization, typically acting after pollen lands on a stigma. It does not cause universal pollen abortion within the anther during development. CMS and SI are distinct genetic phenomena. The problem describes pollen abortion, not a failure of fertilization due to incompatibility.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Because segregation distortion linked to the cytoplasm eliminates functional pollen genotypes during meiosis, leaving only nonfunctional pollen.**\nThis describes segregation distortion, or meiotic drive, which alters the expected Mendelian ratios of gametes. The problem, however, states that pollen grains with \"normal\" (and presumably functional) nuclear genotypes are formed but are nonfunctional. It does not state that these genotypes are eliminated. The mechanism is a developmental failure of *all* pollen, not the selective elimination of certain genotypes.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Because restorer-of-fertility alleles act only in the pollen gametophyte, sterility persists until the haploid pollen nucleus expresses them; in their absence, all pollen is nonfunctional regardless of the site of CMS expression.**\nThis option makes a generalization that is not universally true; Rf genes can act either sporophytically or gametophytically, depending on the specific CMS system. More critically, even if a restorer allele were to act gametophytically (i.e., be expressed in the pollen), it would likely be ineffective in this specific case. The problem clearly states the primary defect is in the sporophytic tapetum. By the time a gametophytic restorer gene could be expressed in the developing microspore, the tapetum would have already failed, and the developmental damage would be irreversible. The crucial point is the site of the CMS defect (sporophytic), which this option disregards.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2803417"}]}
