It is scientifically grounded in the principles of genomics and sequencing analysis, providing a well-posed, objective, and self-contained quantitative question with realistic parameters. It does not violate any criteria for invalidity. The assumptions provided are standard simplifications used for such preliminary calculations in paleogenomics.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows.\n\nLet $N_{raw}$ be the total number of raw reads required.\nThe target effective coverage, $C_{eff}$, is defined as the total number of unique, on-target bases, which we will call $B_{eff}$, divided by the genome size, $G$.\n$$C_{eff} = \\frac{B_{eff}}{G}$$\nFrom this, the total number of effective bases required to achieve the target coverage is:\n$$B_{eff} = C_{eff} \\times G$$\nNow, we must relate $B_{eff}$ to the total number of raw reads, $N_{raw}$. The process involves several steps reflecting the data processing pipeline.\n\nFirst, the total number of raw reads, $N_{raw}$, is filtered by the endogenous content fraction, $f_{endo}$, to determine the number of reads originating from the target genome, $N_{endo}$.\n$$N_{endo} = N_{raw} \\times f_{endo}$$\nSecond, these endogenous reads are subject to deduplication. A fraction $f_{dup}$ of these reads are identified as duplicates and removed. The remaining fraction of unique reads is $(1 - f_{dup})$. The number of unique endogenous reads, $N_{unique}$, is therefore:\n$$N_{unique} = N_{endo} \\times (1 - f_{dup}) = N_{raw} \\times f_{endo} \\times (1 - f_{dup})$$\nAccording to the problem's assumptions, each of these unique endogenous reads contributes its full length, $L$, to the effective base count. Thus, the total number of effective bases, $B_{eff}$, can be expressed as:\n$$B_{eff} = N_{unique} \\times L = N_{raw} \\times f_{endo} \\times (1 - f_{dup}) \\times L$$\nWe now have two expressions for $B_{eff}$. By equating them, we can construct an equation to solve for the unknown quantity, $N_{raw}$.\n$$C_{eff} \\times G = N_{raw} \\times f_{endo} \\times (1 - f_{dup}) \\times L$$\nRearranging to solve for $N_{raw}$:\n$$N_{raw} = \\frac{C_{eff} \\times G}{f_{endo} \\times (1 - f_{dup}) \\times L}$$\nNow, we substitute the given values into this expression:\n- $C_{eff} = 0.5$\n- $G = 3 \\times 10^{9}$\n- $f_{endo} = 0.05$\n- $f_{dup} = 0.30$\n- $L = 75$\n\n$$N_{raw} = \\frac{0.5 \\times (3 \\times 10^{9})}{0.05 \\times (1 - 0.30) \\times 75}$$\nWe calculate the numerator and the denominator separately.\nNumerator:\n$$0.5 \\times 3 \\times 10^{9} = 1.5 \\times 10^{9}$$\nDenominator:\n$$0.05 \\times (1 - 0.30) \\times 75 = 0.05 \\times 0.70 \\times 75 = 0.035 \\times 75 = 2.625$$\nNow, we perform the division:\n$$N_{raw} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{9}}{2.625}$$\n$$N_{raw} = \\frac{1500}{2625} \\times 10^{9} = \\frac{4}{7} \\times 10^{9} \\approx 0.57142857... \\times 10^{9}$$\nTo express this in standard scientific notation, we write:\n$$N_{raw} \\approx 5.7142857... \\times 10^{8}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$N_{raw} \\approx 5.71 \\times 10^{8}$$\nThis is the total number of raw sequencing reads that must be generated to meet the specified effective coverage goal under the given conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.71 \\times 10^8}$$", "id": "2691892"}, {"introduction": "Once sequenced, ancient DNA reads are riddled with artifacts that can mimic true genetic variation, the most common of which is cytosine deamination. Distinguishing these post-mortem chemical changes from genuine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is a cornerstone of paleogenomic data analysis. In this practice problem [@problem_id:1468882], you will derive a quantitative metric to diagnose such damage by exploiting its characteristic strand-biased signature, a key quality control step in any aDNA study.", "problem": "In the field of paleogenomics, a significant challenge is distinguishing genuine genetic variation from post-mortem DNA damage. One of the most common forms of such damage is the deamination of cytosine (C) into uracil (U). During the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification process, which is necessary for studying the trace amounts of ancient DNA, DNA polymerase reads this U as a thymine (T). Consequently, a C-base in the ancient organism's DNA can be erroneously reported as a T-base by a sequencing machine, mimicking a C-to-T Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP).\n\nThis issue is further complicated by the double-stranded nature of DNA. If a C on the reverse strand deaminates, its original partner on the forward strand was a guanine (G). The damaged C-to-U change on the reverse strand will be read as a T, and bioinformatic pipelines will infer its complement on the forward strand as an adenine (A). Therefore, C-deamination damage can manifest as either a C-to-T or a G-to-A substitution in the final sequence data, depending on which strand the damage occurred.\n\nA key diagnostic method to identify these damage artifacts is to check for strand bias. A true heterozygous SNP should be present on DNA fragments originating from both the forward and reverse strands. In contrast, a damage-induced substitution is a chemical artifact that is more likely to accumulate on one strand over the other at a given position.\n\nConsider a scenario where you are analyzing a single nucleotide position in an ancient DNA sample. The reference genome has a guanine (G) at this position, but your sequencing reads show a mixture of both 'G' and 'A' bases. The counts are as follows:\n- $n_{f,A}$: The number of reads aligned to the forward strand that show an 'A'.\n- $n_{f,G}$: The number of reads aligned to the forward strand that show a 'G'.\n- $n_{r,A}$: The number of reads aligned to the reverse strand that show an 'A'.\n- $n_{r,G}$: The number of reads aligned to the reverse strand that show a 'G'.\n\nTo quantify the degree of strand preference for the 'A' base, we define a custom \"Asymmetry Score\", $S_{bias}$. This score is defined as the absolute difference between the observed fraction of 'A' reads on the forward strand and the expected fraction under a no-bias assumption, all normalized by this expected fraction.\n- The observed fraction, $F_{obs}$, is the proportion of all observed 'A' reads that map to the forward strand.\n- The expected fraction, $F_{exp}$, is the proportion of all reads (of any base) that map to the forward strand. This represents the baseline expectation for the distribution of 'A' reads if they were distributed without any strand preference.\n\nThe Asymmetry Score is thus given by $S_{bias} = \\frac{|F_{obs} - F_{exp}|}{F_{exp}}$.\n\nDerive a single closed-form analytic expression for $S_{bias}$ in terms of the four measured quantities: $n_{f,A}$, $n_{f,G}$, $n_{r,A}$, and $n_{r,G}$.", "solution": "The goal is to derive a closed-form expression for the Asymmetry Score, $S_{bias}$, using the provided counts. The formula for the score is $S_{bias} = \\frac{|F_{obs} - F_{exp}|}{F_{exp}}$. We need to find expressions for $F_{obs}$ and $F_{exp}$ in terms of the given variables.\n\nFirst, let's define the intermediate total counts based on the four fundamental measurements:\n- The total number of reads showing an 'A' is $N_A = n_{f,A} + n_{r,A}$.\n- The total number of reads showing a 'G' is $N_G = n_{f,G} + n_{r,G}$.\n- The total number of reads aligned to the forward strand is $N_f = n_{f,A} + n_{f,G}$.\n- The total number of reads aligned to the reverse strand is $N_r = n_{r,A} + n_{r,G}$.\n- The total number of all reads covering this position is $N_{total} = N_f + N_r = n_{f,A} + n_{f,G} + n_{r,A} + n_{r,G}$.\n\nNow, we can formulate expressions for $F_{obs}$ and $F_{exp}$ as defined in the problem statement.\n\nStep 1: Determine the expression for $F_{obs}$.\n$F_{obs}$ is the observed fraction of all 'A' reads that are found on the forward strand. This is the number of 'A' reads on the forward strand divided by the total number of 'A' reads.\n$$F_{obs} = \\frac{n_{f,A}}{N_A} = \\frac{n_{f,A}}{n_{f,A} + n_{r,A}}$$\n\nStep 2: Determine the expression for $F_{exp}$.\n$F_{exp}$ is the expected fraction of 'A' reads on the forward strand under a no-bias assumption. The problem defines this as the overall proportion of all reads that map to the forward strand. This is the total number of forward reads divided by the total number of all reads.\n$$F_{exp} = \\frac{N_f}{N_{total}} = \\frac{n_{f,A} + n_{f,G}}{n_{f,A} + n_{f,G} + n_{r,A} + n_{r,G}}$$\n\nStep 3: Substitute the expressions for $F_{obs}$ and $F_{exp}$ into the definition of $S_{bias}$.\n$$S_{bias} = \\frac{|F_{obs} - F_{exp}|}{F_{exp}} = \\frac{\\left| \\frac{n_{f,A}}{n_{f,A} + n_{r,A}} - \\frac{n_{f,A} + n_{f,G}}{n_{f,A} + n_{f,G} + n_{r,A} + n_{r,G}} \\right|}{\\frac{n_{f,A} + n_{f,G}}{n_{f,A} + n_{f,G} + n_{r,A} + n_{r,G}}}$$\n\nStep 4: Simplify the expression. Let's start with the difference inside the absolute value in the numerator.\nTo subtract the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $(n_{f,A} + n_{r,A})(n_{f,A} + n_{f,G} + n_{r,A} + n_{r,G})$.\n$$F_{obs} - F_{exp} = \\frac{n_{f,A}(n_{f,A} + n_{f,G} + n_{r,A} + n_{r,G}) - (n_{f,A} + n_{f,G})(n_{f,A} + n_{r,A})}{(n_{f,A} + n_{r,A})(n_{f,A} + n_{f,G} + n_{r,A} + n_{r,G})}$$\nNow, expand the numerator of this expression:\n$$n_{f,A}(n_{f,A} + n_{f,G} + n_{r,A} + n_{r,G}) = n_{f,A}^2 + n_{f,A}n_{f,G} + n_{f,A}n_{r,A} + n_{f,A}n_{r,G}$$\n$$(n_{f,A} + n_{f,G})(n_{f,A} + n_{r,A}) = n_{f,A}^2 + n_{f,A}n_{r,A} + n_{f,G}n_{f,A} + n_{f,G}n_{r,A}$$\nSubtracting the second expanded term from the first:\n$$(n_{f,A}^2 + n_{f,A}n_{f,G} + n_{f,A}n_{r,A} + n_{f,A}n_{r,G}) - (n_{f,A}^2 + n_{f,A}n_{r,A} + n_{f,G}n_{f,A} + n_{f,G}n_{r,A})$$\nThe terms $n_{f,A}^2$, $n_{f,A}n_{f,G}$, and $n_{f,A}n_{r,A}$ cancel out, leaving:\n$$n_{f,A}n_{r,G} - n_{f,G}n_{r,A}$$\nSo, the difference is:\n$$F_{obs} - F_{exp} = \\frac{n_{f,A}n_{r,G} - n_{f,G}n_{r,A}}{(n_{f,A} + n_{r,A})(n_{f,A} + n_{f,G} + n_{r,A} + n_{r,G})}$$\n\nStep 5: Substitute this simplified difference back into the expression for $S_{bias}$.\n$$S_{bias} = \\frac{\\left| \\frac{n_{f,A}n_{r,G} - n_{f,G}n_{r,A}}{(n_{f,A} + n_{r,A})(n_{f,A} + n_{f,G} + n_{r,A} + n_{r,G})} \\right|}{\\frac{n_{f,A} + n_{f,G}}{n_{f,A} + n_{f,G} + n_{r,A} + n_{r,G}}}$$\nWe can cancel the term $(n_{f,A} + n_{f,G} + n_{r,A} + n_{r,G})$ which appears in the denominator of both the numerator and the main denominator.\n$$S_{bias} = \\frac{\\frac{|n_{f,A}n_{r,G} - n_{f,G}n_{r,A}|}{n_{f,A} + n_{r,A}}}{\\frac{n_{f,A} + n_{f,G}}{1}} = \\frac{|n_{f,A}n_{r,G} - n_{f,G}n_{r,A}|}{(n_{f,A} + n_{r,A})(n_{f,A} + n_{f,G})}$$\nThis is the final simplified, closed-form expression for the Asymmetry Score.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{|n_{f,A}n_{r,G} - n_{f,G}n_{r,A}|}{(n_{f,A} + n_{r,A})(n_{f,A} + n_{f,G})}}$$", "id": "1468882"}, {"introduction": "Paleogenomics offers an unprecedented window into the past, allowing us to directly observe evolutionary processes in action.
