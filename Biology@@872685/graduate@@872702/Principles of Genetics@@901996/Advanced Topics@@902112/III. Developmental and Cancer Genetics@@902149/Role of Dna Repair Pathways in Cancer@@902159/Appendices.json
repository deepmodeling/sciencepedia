This problem requires you to apply first-principles reasoning about the architecture of DNA repair pathways to predict differential drug sensitivities. By dissecting the distinct, sequential roles of the Fanconi Anemia core complex and BRCA2 in response to damage, you can develop a qualitative model of synthetic lethality and drug response [@problem_id:2849340].", "problem": "A laboratory compares the survival of three isogenic human epithelial cell lines after exposure to DNA-damaging agents: wild type (WT), a Fanconi Anemia (FA) core complex–deficient line created by knocking out FANCA, and a BRCA2-deficient line. The FA core complex functions upstream in interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair by assembling an E3 ubiquitin ligase that monoubiquitinates FANCD2 and FANCI to initiate lesion processing, whereas the BRCA2 gene (also known as Fanconi anemia complementation group D1) functions downstream in homologous recombination (HR) by loading RAD51 onto resected DNA ends. Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) inhibitors trap PARP on DNA and disable single-strand break repair, causing replication-associated double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are ordinarily resolved by HR.\n\nStarting from the following core facts and definitions:\n- The Central Dogma links genome integrity to cellular fitness via accurate DNA replication and repair.\n- Interstrand crosslinks stall replication and require a replication-coupled pathway in which the FA core complex activates FANCD2/FANCI, endonucleases “unhook” the crosslink, translesion synthesis bypasses adducts, and HR repairs the resulting DSB intermediates.\n- BRCA2 is essential for RAD51 nucleoprotein filament formation, a defining step of HR.\n- PARP inhibition induces cytotoxicity via accumulation of single-strand breaks and PARP–DNA complexes that are particularly lethal when HR is defective (synthetic lethality).\n\nYou perform clonogenic survival assays with mitomycin C (MMC) and cisplatin (both ICL-inducing agents) and with the PARP inhibitor olaparib. Let $IC_{50}^{X}(Y)$ denote the half-maximal inhibitory concentration for agent $X$ in genotype $Y$. Which option best predicts the qualitative ordering of sensitivities and their mechanistic basis?\n\nA. Crosslinkers (MMC, cisplatin): $IC_{50}^{\\text{ICL}}(\\text{FA-core KO}) < IC_{50}^{\\text{ICL}}(\\text{BRCA2 KO}) < IC_{50}^{\\text{ICL}}(\\text{WT})$; PARP inhibitor (olaparib): $IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{BRCA2 KO}) \\ll IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{FA-core KO}) \\approx IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{WT})$. Rationale: FA-core loss blocks ICL repair upstream (“unhooking” and lesion processing), causing pronounced crosslink hypersensitivity but leaves HR largely intact, whereas BRCA2 loss abolishes HR, causing sensitivity to both crosslinkers and PARP inhibition.\n\nB. Crosslinkers: $IC_{50}^{\\text{ICL}}(\\text{BRCA2 KO}) \\approx IC_{50}^{\\text{ICL}}(\\text{WT}) > IC_{50}^{\\text{ICL}}(\\text{FA-core KO})$; PARP inhibitor: $IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{FA-core KO}) \\ll IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{BRCA2 KO}) \\approx IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{WT})$. Rationale: Upstream FA-core defects sensitize to PARP inhibition more than downstream BRCA2 defects.\n\nC.

Rationale: BRCA2 loss spares ICL repair but does not affect PARP inhibitor response.", "solution": "The problem statement will first be subjected to rigorous validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extraction of Givens**\n\n*   **Cell Lines**: Three isogenic human epithelial cell lines:\n    1.  Wild type (WT)\n    2.  Fanconi Anemia (FA) core complex–deficient (FANCA knockout)\n    3.  BRCA2-deficient\n*   **Genetic and Mechanistic Information**:\n    *   The FA core complex is upstream in interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair. It forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase that monoubiquitinates FANCD2 and FANCI, initiating lesion processing.\n    *   BRCA2 (also Fanconi anemia complementation group D1) is downstream in ICL repair, functioning in homologous recombination (HR) by loading RAD51 onto resected DNA.\n    *   BRCA2 is essential for RAD51 nucleoprotein filament formation, a defining step of HR.\n    *   Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) inhibitors trap PARP on DNA, inhibit single-strand break (SSB) repair, and cause replication-associated double-strand breaks (DSBs).\n    *   DSBs from PARP inhibition are normally repaired by HR.\n    *   The overall ICL repair pathway involves: FA core complex activation of FANCD2/FANCI $\\rightarrow$ endonuclease-mediated \"unhooking\" $\\rightarrow$ translesion synthesis (TLS) $\\rightarrow$ HR-mediated repair of the DSB intermediate.\n    *   PARP inhibition and HR deficiency exhibit synthetic lethality.\n*   **Experimental Setup**:\n    *   Clonogenic survival assays are performed.\n    *   Agents used: Mitomycin C (MMC) and cisplatin (ICL-inducing agents), and olaparib (a PARP inhibitor).\n*   **Notation**: $IC_{50}^{X}(Y)$ denotes the half-maximal inhibitory concentration for agent $X$ in genotype $Y$. A lower $IC_{50}$ value signifies greater cellular sensitivity to the agent.\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is predicated on well-established principles of DNA repair, cancer biology, and pharmacology. The described roles of the Fanconi Anemia pathway, BRCA2 in homologous recombination, and the mechanism of synthetic lethality between PARP inhibition and HR deficiency are cornerstones of the field. The information is scientifically sound and factually correct.\n*   **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides sufficient mechanistic information to deduce the qualitative relationships between an agent's mechanism of action and a cell line's genetic defect. A unique, logical conclusion regarding relative sensitivities can be reached.\n*   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, devoid of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution can be derived from the provided information.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe analysis will be conducted by separately considering the two classes of DNA damaging agents. The notation $IC_{50}$ represents the concentration of a drug required to inhibit cell survival by $50\\%$. Therefore, higher sensitivity corresponds to a lower $IC_{50}$ value.\n\n**1. Sensitivity to Interstrand Crosslink (ICL) Inducing Agents (MMC, Cisplatin)**\n\nThe problem describes ICL repair as a multi-step, replication-coupled pathway. Key steps are the upstream recognition and initiation by the FA core complex and the downstream resolution of a DSB intermediate by HR, for which BRCA2 is essential.\n\n*   **WT (Wild Type) Cells**: These cells possess fully functional FA and HR pathways. They are capable of repairing ICLs efficiently and will exhibit the highest resistance to ICL-inducing agents. Consequently, they will have the highest $IC_{50}$ value: $IC_{50}^{\\text{ICL}}(\\text{WT})$.\n\n*   **BRCA2 KO Cells**: These cells lack a functional BRCA2 protein. According to the provided information, BRCA2 is essential for the downstream HR step of ICL repair. Failure to repair the DSB intermediate that arises after the crosslink is \"unhooked\" is a catastrophic event for the cell. Thus, BRCA2 KO cells will be highly sensitive to ICLs, and their $IC_{50}$ will be substantially lower than that of WT cells: $IC_{50}^{\\text{ICL}}(\\text{BRCA2 KO}) \\ll IC_{50}^{\\text{ICL}}(\\text{WT})$.\n\n*   **FA-core KO (FANCA KO) Cells**: These cells lack a functional FA core complex. This defect is upstream of BRCA2's function. The FA core complex is required to initiate the entire repair process by activating FANCD2/FANCI. A failure at this stage means the crosslink is not even recognized and processed for subsequent unhooking and repair. Such a complete, early block in a critical repair pathway leads to profound replication fork stalling and collapse. This is generally considered a more severe defect for this specific type of lesion than a block in a downstream step. Therefore, it is predicted that FA-core KO cells will be even more sensitive to ICLs than BRCA2 KO cells. This translates to an even lower $IC_{50}$ value.\n\n*   **Qualitative Ordering for ICL Agents**: Combining these deductions, the order of sensitivity is predicted to be FA-core KO > BRCA2 KO > WT. In terms of $IC_{50}$ values:\n    $$IC_{50}^{\\text{ICL}}(\\text{FA-core KO}) < IC_{50}^{\\text{ICL}}(\\text{BRCA2 KO}) \\ll IC_{50}^{\\text{ICL}}(\\text{WT})$$\n\n**2. Sensitivity to PARP Inhibitor (Olaparib)**\n\nThe cytotoxic mechanism of PARP inhibitors involves the conversion of single-strand breaks into replication-associated double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are lethal if not repaired by HR.\n\n*   **WT (Wild Type) Cells**: Possess a functional HR pathway and can therefore repair the DSBs induced by PARP inhibition. They will be relatively resistant. Their $IC_{50}$ value, $IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{WT})$, will be high.\n\n*   **BRCA2 KO Cells**: These cells are deficient in HR because BRCA2 is essential for this pathway. They cannot repair the DSBs generated by PARP inhibition, leading to massive genome instability and cell death. This is the canonical example of synthetic lethality. Consequently, BRCA2 KO cells will be extremely hypersensitive to PARP inhibitors. Their $IC_{50}$ will be drastically lower than that of WT cells:\n    $$IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{BRCA2 KO}) \\ll IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{WT})$$\n\n*   **FA-core KO (FANCA KO) Cells**: The primary, non-redundant role of the FA core complex is the initiation of ICL repair. The problem states that PARPi-induced DSBs are resolved by HR, and that BRCA2 is essential for HR. It does not state that the FA core complex is essential for general HR outside of the specific context of an ICL. Thus, in FA-core KO cells, the HR machinery itself (including BRCA2) is expected to be intact and functional for repairing DSBs that do not originate from ICLs. These cells should therefore be able to repair PARPi-induced DSBs with an efficiency similar to WT cells.\n\n*   **Qualitative Ordering for PARP Inhibitor**: The sensitivity of FA-core KO cells should be similar to that of WT cells, while BRCA2 KO cells are hypersensitive. This gives the order of $IC_{50}$ values:\n    $$IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{BRCA2 KO}) \\ll IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{FA-core KO}) \\approx IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{WT})$$\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **Option A**:\n    *   **Crosslinkers**: Predicts $IC_{50}^{\\text{ICL}}(\\text{FA-core KO}) < IC_{50}^{\\text{ICL}}(\\text{BRCA2 KO}) < IC_{50}^{\\text{ICL}}(\\text{WT})$. This matches our derived ordering.\n    *   **PARP inhibitor**: Predicts $IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{BRCA2 KO}) \\ll IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{FA-core KO}) \\approx IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{WT})$. This also matches our derived ordering.\n    *   **Rationale**: The provided rationale aligns perfectly with our mechanistic analysis: the upstream ICL repair defect in FA-core KO confers maximal ICL sensitivity, whereas the general HR defect in BRCA2 KO confers sensitivity to both ICLs and PARP inhibitors.\n    *   **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n*   **Option B**:\n    *   **Crosslinkers**: Predicts $IC_{50}^{\\text{ICL}}(\\text{BRCA2 KO}) \\approx IC_{50}^{\\text{ICL}}(\\text{WT})$. This is incorrect. BRCA2 deficiency impairs ICL repair, causing sensitivity, not resistance comparable to WT.\n    *   **PARP inhibitor**: Predicts $IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{FA-core KO}) \\ll IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{BRCA2 KO}) \\approx IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{WT})$. This reverses the sensitivities, which is fundamentally incorrect.\n    *   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C**:\n    *   **Prediction**: Claims $IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{FA-core KO}) \\approx IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{BRCA2 KO})$. This is incorrect. It conflates the specific role of the FA core complex in ICL repair with the general role of BRCA2 in all HR, thereby incorrectly predicting equal sensitivity to PARP inhibition.\n    *   **Rationale**: The reasoning that both act in the \"same pathway\" is an oversimplification that ignores the distinct functional roles and contexts.\n    *   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D**:\n    *   **Crosslinkers**: Predicts $IC_{50}^{\\text{ICL}}(\\text{WT}) \\ll IC_{50}^{\\text{ICL}}(\\text{BRCA2 KO})$. This claims BRCA2 KO cells are highly resistant to ICLs, which is patently false.\n    *   **PARP inhibitor**: Predicts $IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{FA-core KO}) \\approx IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{BRCA2 KO}) \\approx IC_{50}^{\\text{PARPi}}(\\text{WT})$. This incorrectly states that BRCA2 KO cells are not sensitive to PARP inhibitors, contradicting the principle of synthetic lethality.\n    *   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\nBased on a systematic analysis of the underlying molecular biology, only Option A provides a correct prediction and a sound mechanistic rationale.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2849340"}, {"introduction": "The historical activity of defective DNA repair pathways leaves indelible \"scars\" on a cancer genome, such as large-scale loss of heterozygosity. This exercise simulates a real-world diagnostic challenge: calculating and interpreting a genomic scar score (the HRD score) using data from two different technologies. You will discover how an assay's ability to detect copy-number-neutral events is critical for accurately identifying homologous recombination deficient tumors and predicting their sensitivity to therapies like PARP inhibitors [@problem_id:2849319].", "problem": "A homologous recombination (HR) pathway repairs DNA double-strand breaks by copying intact sequence from a sister chromatid, preserving allelic balance. When HR is defective, as in tumors with BRCA1 or BRCA2 loss-of-function, repair is diverted to error-prone processes that leave characteristic large-scale allelic-imbalance patterns, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH), telomeric allelic imbalance (TAI), and large-scale state transitions (LST). Loss of heterozygosity can arise with or without changes in total copy number. Copy-number-neutral loss of heterozygosity (cnLOH) reflects mitotic recombination or gene conversion that reduces heterozygosity without changing total copy number. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors exploit the synthetic lethality of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), so accurate assessment of HRD genomically is clinically relevant.\n\nTwo ovarian carcinomas are profiled with two different genome-wide methods:\n\n- Method $\\mathcal{A}$ uses single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) allele frequencies and total copy number to detect allelic-imbalance-defined segments. It enumerates segments of LOH longer than $15$ megabases (Mb) excluding whole-chromosome events, counts TAI as allelic-imbalance tracts that extend to a telomere and exceed $11$ Mb, and counts LST as inter-breakpoint transitions between segments larger than $10$ Mb separated by less than $3$ Mb. For the purposes of this question, the homologous recombination deficiency score for Method $\\mathcal{A}$, denoted $S_{\\mathcal{A}}$, is defined as the total count of LOH plus TAI plus LST segments, without regard to whether the segments involve total copy-number change.\n\n- Method $\\mathcal{B}$ uses low-coverage copy-number profiling without allele frequencies; it registers only total copy-number alterations. For the purposes of this question, the homologous recombination deficiency score for Method $\\mathcal{B}$, denoted $S_{\\mathcal{B}}$, is defined as the total number of large ($>15$ Mb) deletions plus the number of TAI tracts with copy-number change plus the number of LST breakpoints accompanied by a change in total copy number.\n\nTumor $X$ (germline BRCA1 truncating variant with somatic loss of the remaining allele by cnLOH across chromosome $17$q) shows the following genome-wide summary:\n- LOH segments > 15 Mb: $18$ total, of which $15$ are copy-number-neutral and $3$ accompany deletions.\n- TAI tracts: $12$ total, of which $10$ are copy-number-neutral and $2$ accompany copy-number change.\n- LST breakpoints: $20$ total, of which $14$ are copy-number-neutral and $6$ accompany copy-number change.\n- Deletions > 15 Mb: $3$.\n\nTumor $Y$ (no BRCA1/BRCA2 alteration; intact HR by functional assay) shows:\n- LOH segments > 15 Mb: $9$ total, all $9$ accompany deletions.\n- TAI tracts: $7$ total, of which $1$ is copy-number-neutral and $6$ accompany copy-number change.\n- LST breakpoints: $22$ total, of which $4$ are copy-number-neutral and $18$ accompany copy-number change.\n- Deletions > 15 Mb: $9$.\n\nBased only on first principles about allelic imbalance, loss of heterozygosity, and the definitions above, which statement best interprets the impact of copy-number-neutral loss of heterozygosity versus deletions on homologous recombination deficiency genomic scores and predicts the most likely implications for sensitivity to Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors?\n\nA. Method $\\mathcal{A}$ will assign a higher $S_{\\mathcal{A}}$ to Tumor $X$ than to Tumor $Y$ because it captures copy-number-neutral allelic-imbalance scars; Method $\\mathcal{B}$ will assign a substantially lower $S_{\\mathcal{B}}$ to Tumor $X$ than to Tumor $Y$ because it ignores copy-number-neutral events, risking false-negative homologous recombination deficiency classification for Tumor $X$ and underprediction of its PARP inhibitor sensitivity.\n\nB. Both Method $\\mathcal{A}$ and Method $\\mathcal{B}$ will assign higher homologous recombination deficiency scores to Tumor $Y$ than to Tumor $X$ because deletions dominate Tumor $Y$; this indicates Tumor $Y$ is more likely to be sensitive to PARP inhibition than Tumor $X$.\n\nC. Both Method $\\mathcal{A}$ and Method $\\mathcal{B}$ will assign similarly high homologous recombination deficiency scores to Tumor $X$, correctly predicting PARP inhibitor sensitivity regardless of platform; copy-number-neutral loss of heterozygosity does not materially influence either score.\n\nD. Method $\\mathcal{A}$ will under-score Tumor $X$ relative to Tumor $Y$ because copy-number-neutral loss of heterozygosity does not contribute to allelic-imbalance-defined metrics; Method $\\mathcal{B}$ will correctly classify Tumor $X$ as homologous recombination deficient and predict PARP inhibitor sensitivity based on its deletion burden.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n- **Homologous Recombination (HR):** Repairs DNA double-strand breaks by copying from a sister chromatid, preserving allelic balance.\n- **Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD):** Caused by defects like BRCA1 or BRCA2 loss-of-function.

The definitions of the genomic scar metrics are analogous to those used in established clinical diagnostic tests.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides clear and unambiguous definitions for two distinct scoring methods, $S_{\\mathcal{A}}$ and $S_{\\mathcal{B}}$. It supplies all necessary quantitative data for two tumors, $X$ and $Y$, to permit direct calculation of these scores. The question asks for an interpretation based on these calculations, which is a solvable, non-ambiguous task.\n3.  **Consistency:** The data are internally consistent. For Tumor $X$, there are $3$ LOH segments accompanying deletions, and the separate count of deletions > 15 Mb is also $3$. For Tumor $Y$, there are $9$ LOH segments accompanying deletions, and the count of deletions > 15 Mb is also $9$. This internal consistency confirms the data is not contradictory.\n4.  **Realism:** The scenarios describe two classic archetypes of tumors: one with HRD driven by BRCA1 loss and characterized by cnLOH, and another, HR-proficient tumor with chromosomal instability driven by copy-number alterations. These profiles are realistic and commonly observed in clinical practice.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-constructed exercise in applying formal definitions to quantitative data and interpreting the results in a biological and clinical context. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe objective is to calculate the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) scores $S_{\\mathcal{A}}$ and $S_{\\mathcal{B}}$ for Tumor $X$ and Tumor $Y$ and interpret the findings.\n\nThe scoring rules are:\n$$S_{\\mathcal{A}} = (\\text{Total LOH}) + (\\text{Total TAI}) + (\\text{Total LST})$$\n$$S_{\\mathcal{B}} = (\\text{Deletions}  15 \\text{ Mb}) + (\\text{TAI with copy-number change}) + (\\text{LST with copy-number change})$$\n\n**Calculation for Tumor $X$ (HR-deficient):**\n- Data for $S_{\\mathcal{A}}$: Total LOH = $18$, Total TAI = $12$, Total LST = $20$.\n$$S_{\\mathcal{A}}(X) = 18 + 12 + 20 = 50$$\n- Data for $S_{\\mathcal{B}}$: Deletions > 15 Mb = $3$, TAI with copy-number change = $2$, LST with copy-number change = $6$.\n$$S_{\\mathcal{B}}(X) = 3 + 2 + 6 = 11$$\n\n**Calculation for Tumor $Y$ (HR-proficient):**\n- Data for $S_{\\mathcal{A}}$: Total LOH = $9$, Total TAI = $7$, Total LST = $22$.\n$$S_{\\mathcal{A}}(Y) = 9 + 7 + 22 = 38$$\n- Data for $S_{\\mathcal{B}}$: Deletions > 15 Mb = $9$, TAI with copy-number change = $6$, LST with copy-number change = $18$.\n$$S_{\\mathcal{B}}(Y) = 9 + 6 + 18 = 33$$\n\n**Summary of Scores:**\n- Tumor $X$: $S_{\\mathcal{A}} = 50$, $S_{\\mathcal{B}} = 11$.\n- Tumor $Y$: $S_{\\mathcal{A}} = 38$, $S_{\\mathcal{B}} = 33$.\n\n**Interpretation of Results:**\n- **Comparison:** We find that $S_{\\mathcal{A}}(X)  S_{\\mathcal{A}}(Y)$ ($50  38$), while $S_{\\mathcal{B}}(X)  S_{\\mathcal{B}}(Y)$ ($11  33$).\n- **Method $\\mathcal{A}$:** This method, which is sensitive to all forms of allelic imbalance including copy-number-neutral events, correctly assigns a higher score to the known HR-deficient Tumor $X$. The large number of copy-number-neutral scars of HRD in Tumor $X$ ($15$ cnLOH, $10$ cn-TAI, $14$ cn-LST) are captured by this method, leading to a high score.\n- **Method $\\mathcal{B}$:** This method is blind to allele frequencies and only detects total copy number changes. It therefore misses the predominant copy-number-neutral scars in Tumor $X$. Consequently, it assigns a very low score ($S_{\\mathcal{B}}(X) = 11$) to the truly HR-deficient tumor. Conversely, it assigns a spuriously high score ($S_{\\mathcal{B}}(Y) = 33$) to the HR-proficient Tumor $Y$ because that tumor's genome is unstable due to many copy number alterations (deletions).\n- **Clinical Implications:** A low score of $11$ from Method $\\mathcal{B}$ for Tumor $X$ would likely result in a false-negative classification, meaning the tumor would be deemed HR-proficient. This would lead to the incorrect clinical conclusion that the tumor is not sensitive to PARP inhibitors, denying a patient a potentially effective therapy. Method $\\mathcal{A}$ correctly identifies Tumor $X$ as having a high HRD score, leading to the correct prediction of PARP inhibitor sensitivity.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\n**A. Method $\\mathcal{A}$ will assign a higher $S_{\\mathcal{A}}$ to Tumor $X$ than to Tumor $Y$ because it captures copy-number-neutral allelic-imbalance scars; Method $\\mathcal{B}$ will assign a substantially lower $S_{\\mathcal{B}}$ to Tumor $X$ than to Tumor $Y$ because it ignores copy-number-neutral events, risking false-negative homologous recombination deficiency classification for Tumor $X$ and underprediction of its PARP inhibitor sensitivity.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement perfectly matches our calculations and interpretation. $S_{\\mathcal{A}}(X) = 50$ is higher than $S_{\\mathcal{A}}(Y) = 38$. $S_{\\mathcal{B}}(X) = 11$ is substantially lower than $S_{\\mathcal{B}}(Y) = 33$. The reason for the discrepancy is accurately identified as Method $\\mathcal{A}$'s ability to detect copy-number-neutral events, which Method $\\mathcal{B}$ cannot. The clinical consequence—a risk of a false-negative result for Tumor $X$ using Method $\\mathcal{B}$ and underprediction of PARP inhibitor sensitivity—is also correctly stated.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Both Method $\\mathcal{A}$ and Method $\\mathcal{B}$ will assign higher homologous recombination deficiency scores to Tumor $Y$ than to Tumor $X$ because deletions dominate Tumor $Y$; this indicates Tumor $Y$ is more likely to be sensitive to PARP inhibition than Tumor $X$.**\n- **Evaluation:** The premise is false. Our calculation shows that Method $\\mathcal{A}$ assigns a higher score to Tumor $X$ ($S_{\\mathcal{A}}(X) = 50$) than to Tumor $Y$ ($S_{\\mathcal{A}}(Y) = 38$). Furthermore, the conclusion is biologically incorrect; Tumor $X$ is the HR-deficient tumor and is expected to be sensitive to PARP inhibition, not Tumor $Y$.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Both Method $\\mathcal{A}$ and Method $\\mathcal{B}$ will assign similarly high homologous recombination deficiency scores to Tumor $X$, correctly predicting PARP inhibitor sensitivity regardless of platform; copy-number-neutral loss of heterozygosity does not materially influence either score.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement is false on multiple grounds. The scores for Tumor $X$ are not similar ($S_{\\mathcal{A}} = 50$ vs. $S_{\\mathcal{B}} = 11$). Copy-number-neutral events are precisely the reason for the high score from Method $\\mathcal{A}$ and thus materially influence the outcome. Method $\\mathcal{B}$ fails to correctly predict sensitivity.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.

This problem guides you through the construction of a Bayesian model to determine if a tumor has undergone loss of heterozygosity (LOH), a key mechanism of biallelic inactivation for tumor suppressors like $BRCA2$. By formally integrating the observed variant allele fraction with prior knowledge of tumor purity and copy number, you will calculate a posterior probability that provides a quantitative measure of confidence in the diagnosis of LOH [@problem_id:2849317].", "problem": "A patient carries a heterozygous germline truncating mutation in the *BRCA2* gene. In a tumor biopsy, short-read sequencing of the BRCA2 locus yields $N$ independent reads, of which $X$ support the germline variant. The tumor purity is $p$, and allele-specific copy-number profiling at the BRCA2 locus indicates an integer total tumor copy number $C$ with no evidence of subclonality at this locus. Assume the following foundational principles and modeling assumptions:\n\n- In normal cells that are heterozygous at germline, the expected variant allele fraction is $1/2$.\n- In tumor cells, the expected fraction of BRCA2 copies carrying the germline variant equals the ratio of the number of tumor copies bearing the germline variant to the total number of tumor copies $C$ at the locus.\n- The observed variant read count $X$ is generated by independent sampling from a Bernoulli process with success probability equal to the mixture of the tumor and normal compartments, weighted by the tumor purity $p$.\n- Biallelic inactivation at BRCA2 arises via loss of heterozygosity (LOH) that removes the wild-type allele such that all tumor copies at the locus carry the germline variant. In the absence of such LOH, the tumor retains a single copy of the germline variant among the $C$ tumor copies at this locus.\n- There is no allelic mapping bias, and sequencing errors can be neglected at this depth.\n\nLet $p=0.6$, $C=3$, $N=40$, and $X=28$. Suppose your prior probability that the tumor exhibits biallelic inactivation at BRCA2 via loss of heterozygosity is $\\pi=0.2$. Using Bayes’ rule with a binomial likelihood and the above assumptions, derive from first principles an explicit expression for the posterior probability that the tumor exhibits biallelic inactivation given the observed data $(X,N)$, and then evaluate it numerically. Express your final posterior probability as a decimal fraction, rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and free of contradiction or ambiguity. It presents a standard, formalizable problem in computational cancer genomics. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe task is to compute the posterior probability of biallelic inactivation via loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the $BRCA2$ locus, given the sequencing data. This is a problem of Bayesian inference. We define two mutually exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses:\n$H_{\\text{LOH}}$: The tumor exhibits biallelic inactivation via LOH.\n$H_{\\text{noLOH}}$: The tumor does not exhibit LOH, retaining one wild-type and one mutant allele.\n\nThe prior probabilities for these hypotheses are given as:\n$P(H_{\\text{LOH}}) = \\pi = 0.2$\n$P(H_{\\text{noLOH}}) = 1 - \\pi = 0.8$\n\nThe data consists of the number of variant reads, $X$, out of a total of $N$ reads, denoted as $D = (X, N)$. The problem states that $X$ follows a binomial distribution, conditioned on the total reads $N$ and the expected variant allele fraction (VAF) in the sample, $\\theta$. The likelihood of observing the data $D$ under a given hypothesis $H$ is thus:\n$$P(D|H) = \\binom{N}{X} \\theta_H^X (1 - \\theta_H)^{N-X}$$\nwhere $\\theta_H$ is the expected VAF under hypothesis $H$.\n\nThe sample is a mixture of tumor cells (with fraction $p$) and normal cells (with fraction $1-p$). The overall expected VAF, $\\theta$, is the weighted average of the VAFs from the two compartments:\n$$\\theta = p \\cdot VAF_{\\text{tumor}} + (1-p) \\cdot VAF_{\\text{normal}}$$\nAccording to the problem, normal cells are heterozygous, so $VAF_{\\text{normal}} = \\frac{1}{2}$. The $VAF_{\\text{tumor}}$ depends on the LOH status.\n\nUnder hypothesis $H_{\\text{LOH}}$, all tumor copies of the gene carry the variant. The total tumor copy number is $C$. Thus, the number of variant copies is $C$, and $VAF_{\\text{tumor, LOH}} = \\frac{C}{C} = 1$. The expected VAF for the sample is:\n$$\\theta_{\\text{LOH}} = p \\cdot (1) + (1-p) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = p + \\frac{1-p}{2} = \\frac{p+1}{2}$$\n\nUnder hypothesis $H_{\\text{noLOH}}$, the tumor retains a single copy of the germline variant among its $C$ total copies at the locus. Thus, $VAF_{\\text{tumor, noLOH}} = \\frac{1}{C}$. The expected VAF for the sample is:\n$$\\theta_{\\text{noLOH}} = p \\cdot \\frac{1}{C} + (1-p) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{p}{C} + \\frac{1-p}{2}$$\n\nWe seek the posterior probability $P(H_{\\text{LOH}}|D)$. Using Bayes' rule:\n$$P(H_{\\text{LOH}}|D) = \\frac{P(D|H_{\\text{LOH}}) P(H_{\\text{LOH}})}{P(D)}$$\nThe total probability of the data, $P(D)$, is the marginal likelihood, found by summing over all hypotheses:\n$$P(D) = P(D|H_{\\text{LOH}}) P(H_{\\text{LOH}}) + P(D|H_{\\text{noLOH}}) P(H_{\\text{noLOH}})$$\nSubstituting the binomial likelihood gives the explicit expression for the posterior probability:\n$$P(H_{\\text{LOH}}|D) = \\frac{\\binom{N}{X} \\theta_{\\text{LOH}}^X (1 - \\theta_{\\text{LOH}})^{N-X} \\pi}{\\binom{N}{X} \\theta_{\\text{LOH}}^X (1 - \\theta_{\\text{LOH}})^{N-X} \\pi + \\binom{N}{X} \\theta_{\\text{noLOH}}^X (1 - \\theta_{\\text{noLOH}})^{N-X} (1-\\pi)}$$\nThe binomial coefficient $\\binom{N}{X}$ cancels, yielding the required expression:\n$$P(H_{\\text{LOH}}|X, N) = \\frac{\\theta_{\\text{LOH}}^X (1 - \\theta_{\\text{LOH}})^{N-X} \\pi}{\\theta_{\\text{LOH}}^X (1 - \\theta_{\\text{LOH}})^{N-X} \\pi + \\theta_{\\text{noLOH}}^X (1 - \\theta_{\\text{noLOH}})^{N-X} (1-\\pi)}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values: $p=0.6$, $C=3$, $N=40$, $X=28$, and $\\pi=0.2$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the expected VAFs for each hypothesis:\n$$\\theta_{\\text{LOH}} = \\frac{0.6+1}{2} = \\frac{1.6}{2} = 0.8$$\n$$\\theta_{\\text{noLOH}} = \\frac{0.6}{3} + \\frac{1-0.6}{2} = 0.2 + \\frac{0.4}{2} = 0.2 + 0.2 = 0.4$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the likelihood terms, which we denote $L_{\\text{LOH}}$ and $L_{\\text{noLOH}}$:\n$$L_{\\text{LOH}} = \\theta_{\\text{LOH}}^X (1 - \\theta_{\\text{LOH}})^{N-X} = (0.8)^{28} (1 - 0.8)^{40-28} = (0.8)^{28} (0.2)^{12}$$\n$$L_{\\text{noLOH}} = \\theta_{\\text{noLOH}}^X (1 - \\theta_{\\text{noLOH}})^{N-X} = (0.4)^{28} (1 - 0.4)^{40-28} = (0.4)^{28} (0.6)^{12}$$\n\nThe posterior probability is:\n$$P(H_{\\text{LOH}}|D) = \\frac{L_{\\text{LOH}} \\cdot \\pi}{L_{\\text{LOH}} \\cdot \\pi + L_{\\text{noLOH}} \\cdot (1-\\pi)}$$\nTo simplify the calculation, we first compute the likelihood ratio:\n$$\\frac{L_{\\text{noLOH}}}{L_{\\text{LOH}}} = \\frac{(0.4)^{28} (0.6)^{12}}{(0.8)^{28} (0.2)^{12}} = \\left(\\frac{0.4}{0.8}\\right)^{28} \\left(\\frac{0.6}{0.2}\\right)^{12} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{28} (3)^{12} = \\frac{3^{12}}{2^{28}}$$\nWe can rewrite the posterior probability by dividing the numerator and denominator by $L_{\\text{LOH}}$:\n$$P(H_{\\text{LOH}}|D) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\pi + \\frac{L_{\\text{noLOH}}}{L_{\\text{LOH}}}(1-\\pi)} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\pi + \\frac{3^{12}}{2^{28}}(1-\\pi)}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate the terms:\n$3^{12} = 531441$\n$2^{28} = (2^{14})^2 = 16384^2 = 268435456$\nThe prior probabilities are $\\pi = 0.2$ and $1-\\pi = 0.8$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the posterior probability:\n$$P(H_{\\text{LOH}}|D) = \\frac{0.2}{0.2 + \\frac{531441}{268435456} \\cdot 0.8}$$\n$$P(H_{\\text{LOH}}|D) \\approx \\frac{0.2}{0.2 + (0.0019797) \\cdot 0.8} \\approx \\frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.0015838} = \\frac{0.2}{0.2015838} \\approx 0.992143$$\nAlternatively, using the exact fraction:\n$$P(H_{\\text{LOH}}|D) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1-\\pi}{\\pi} \\frac{3^{12}}{2^{28}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{0.8}{0.2} \\frac{3^{12}}{2^{28}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 4 \\frac{3^{12}}{2^{28}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{3^{12}}{2^{26}}}$$\n$$P(H_{\\text{LOH}}|D) = \\frac{2^{26}}{2^{26} + 3^{12}} = \\frac{67108864}{67108864 + 531441} = \\frac{67108864}{67640305} \\approx 0.992145$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.9921$.
