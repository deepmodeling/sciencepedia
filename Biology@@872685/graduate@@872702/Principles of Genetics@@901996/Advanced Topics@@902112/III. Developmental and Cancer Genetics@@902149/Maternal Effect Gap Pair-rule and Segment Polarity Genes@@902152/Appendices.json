The general form of the dynamics for a gene product $X \\in \\{H,K,N,G\\}$ is given as:\n$$\n\\frac{dX}{dt} = \\beta_{X} A_{X}(x) \\prod_{Y \\neq X} \\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{Y}{K_{XY}}\\right)^{n}} - \\gamma_{X} X\n$$\nThis equation describes the rate of change of concentration $X$ as a balance between production and degradation. The production term is activated by maternal morphogens through the function $A_X(x)$ and repressed by the other gap gene products $Y$. The degradation is a first-order process with rate constant $\\gamma_X$. All repression terms share a common Hill coefficient $n \\geq 1$.\n\nWe must define the activation functions $A_X(x) \\in [0,1]$ based on the provided biological information and using Hill-type kinetics. The maternal morphogen Bicoid, $B(x)$, is a strictly decreasing function of position $x$, while Caudal, $C(x)$, is strictly increasing.\n1.  Hunchback ($H$) is activated by Bicoid ($B$).

This function correctly yields high $H$ expression in the anterior (high $B(x)$) and low expression in the posterior.\n2.  Knirps ($N$) is activated by Caudal ($C$).

Such a non-monotonic spatial profile can be generated by the product of two opposing monotonic functions. We model this as activation by both $B(x)$ and $C(x)$ in a combinatorial, AND-gate fashion. Since $B(x)$ is decreasing and $C(x)$ is increasing, their product can have a maximum at an intermediate position $x$.

By renaming $\\tau$ back to $t$ and defining the dimensionless production-strength parameter $\\alpha = \\frac{\\beta A^*}{\\gamma K_0}$, we arrive at the target system:\n$$ \\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+k^n} - h, \\qquad \\frac{dk}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+h^n} - k $$\nThis completes the second part.\n\nFor the third part, we perform a stability analysis of the symmetric fixed point of this dimensionless system. The fixed points $(h^*,k^*)$ are the solutions to $\\frac{dh}{dt}=0$ and $\\frac{dk}{dt}=0$:\n$$ h^* = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+(k^*)^n}, \\qquad k^* = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+(h^*)^n} $$\nDue to the system's symmetry, there exists a symmetric fixed point where $h^*=k^*$. Substituting this into the first equation yields a condition for the symmetric state's concentration:\n$$ h^* = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+(h^*)^n} \\implies h^*(1+(h^*)^n) = \\alpha $$\nFor any $\\alpha > 0$, the function $F(h^*) = h^*+(h^*)^{n+1}$ is strictly increasing for $h^* \\ge 0$, guaranteeing a unique symmetric fixed point exists.\n\nTo determine its stability, we compute the Jacobian matrix $J$ of the system at $(h^*, h^*)$:\n$$ J(h^*,h^*) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial h}(\\frac{\\alpha}{1+k^n}-h) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k}(\\frac{\\alpha}{1+k^n}-h) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial h}(\\frac{\\alpha}{1+h^n}-k) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k}(\\frac{\\alpha}{1+h^n}-k) \\end{pmatrix}_{(h^*,h^*)} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & \\frac{-\\alpha n (h^*)^{n-1}}{(1+(h^*)^n)^2} \\\\ \\frac{-\\alpha n (h^*)^{n-1}}{(1+(h^*)^n)^2} & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nUsing the fixed point relation $\\alpha = h^*(1+(h^*)^n)$, the off-diagonal element simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{-\\alpha n (h^*)^{n-1}}{(1+(h^*)^n)^2} = \\frac{-h^*(1+(h^*)^n) n (h^*)^{n-1}}{(1+(h^*)^n)^2} = \\frac{-n(h^*)^n}{1+(h^*)^n} $$\nLet $C = \\frac{-n(h^*)^n}{1+(h^*)^n}$.

The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are solutions to $\\det(J-\\lambda I)=0$:\n$$ (-1-\\lambda)^2 - C^2 = 0 \\implies \\lambda = -1 \\pm C $$\nSince $h^*>0$ and $n \\ge 1$, $C$ is negative. Let $C = -|C|$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -1-|C|$ and $\\lambda_2 = -1+|C|$.\nThe fixed point is stable if and only if both eigenvalues are negative. $\\lambda_1$ is always negative. Stability thus requires $\\lambda_2 < 0$, which means $|C| < 1$:\n$$ |C| = \\frac{n(h^*)^n}{1+(h^*)^n} < 1 \\implies n(h^*)^n < 1+(h^*)^n \\implies (n-1)(h^*)^n < 1 $$\nBistability emerges through a pitchfork bifurcation when the symmetric fixed point loses stability. This occurs when an eigenvalue crosses zero. Here, it is when $\\lambda_2=0$, which implies $|C|=1$.\nThis condition for bifurcation, $(n-1)(h^*)^n=1$, can only be met if $n>1$. For $n=1$, the condition is $0<1$, which is always true, so the system is always stable and no bistability occurs.

The positional shift is `$\\Delta x = x_{b,1} - x_{b,2}$`, and the fractional shift is `$s = \\Delta x / L$`.\n\nFirst, we analyze Model A: absolute-threshold activation.\nIn this model, the `$hb$` boundary, `$x_{\\mathrm{b}}$`, is located where the Bicoid concentration equals a fixed threshold `$T$`.\nThe boundary condition is `$C(x_{\\mathrm{b}}) = T$`.\n\nFor the unperturbed embryo:\n`$C_{0} \\exp(-x_{b,1}/\\lambda) = T$`\n`$\\exp(-x_{b,1}/\\lambda) = T/C_{0}$`\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`$-x_{b,1}/\\lambda = \\ln(T/C_{0})$`\n`$x_{b,1} = \\lambda \\ln(C_{0}/T)$`\n\nFor the perturbed embryo with concentration `$C_{0}/2$`:\n`$(C_{0}/2) \\exp(-x_{b,2}/\\lambda) = T$`\n`$\\exp(-x_{b,2}/\\lambda) = 2T/C_{0}$`\n`$-x_{b,2}/\\lambda = \\ln(2T/C_{0})$`\n`$x_{b,2} = \\lambda \\ln(C_{0}/(2T))$`\n\nThe shift `$\\Delta x_{A}$` is the difference between these positions:\n`$\\Delta x_{A} = x_{b,1} - x_{b,2} = \\lambda \\ln(C_{0}/T) - \\lambda \\ln(C_{0}/(2T))$`\n`$\\Delta x_{A} = \\lambda \\left[ \\ln(C_{0}/T) - (\\ln(C_{0}/T) - \\ln(2)) \\right] = \\lambda \\ln(2)$`\n\nThe predicted fractional shift for Model A, `$s_{A}$`, is:\n`$s_{A} = \\Delta x_{A} / L = (\\lambda/L) \\ln(2)$`\nGiven `$\\lambda/L = 0.2$`, we compute `$s_{A}$`:\n`$s_{A} = 0.2 \\ln(2) \\approx 0.138629$`\n\nNext, we analyze Model B: cooperative, normalized activation.\nThe transcription output is given by a Hill function: `$y(x) = \\frac{C(x)^{n}}{K^{n} + C(x)^{n}}$`. The boundary `$x_{\\mathrm{b}}$` is set where the output `$y(x_{\\mathrm{b}})$` is a fraction `$q$` of the maximum output for that specific embryo, `$y_{\\max} = y(0)$`.\nThe boundary condition is `$y(x_{\\mathrm{b}}) = q \\, y_{\\max}$`.\n\nLet's derive a general expression for `$x_{\\mathrm{b}}$`.\nFirst, `$y_{\\max} = y(0) = \\frac{C_{0}^{n}}{K^{n} + C_{0}^{n}}$`.\nThe boundary condition is `$\\frac{C(x_{\\mathrm{b}})^{n}}{K^{n} + C(x_{\\mathrm{b}})^{n}} = q \\left( \\frac{C_{0}^{n}}{K^{n} + C_{0}^{n}} \\right)$`.\nWe can solve for `$C(x_{\\mathrm{b}})^{n}$`. Let `$f(C) = \\frac{C^{n}}{K^{n}+C^{n}}$`. The inverse relation is `$C^{n} = \\frac{f(C) K^{n}}{1-f(C)}$`.\nApplying this to our boundary condition, where `$f(C(x_{\\mathrm{b}})) = q f(C_{0})$`:\n`$C(x_{\\mathrm{b}})^{n} = \\frac{q f(C_{0}) K^{n}}{1 - q f(C_{0})} = \\frac{q \\frac{C_{0}^{n}}{K^{n}+C_{0}^{n}} K^{n}}{1 - q \\frac{C_{0}^{n}}{K^{n}+C_{0}^{n}}} = \\frac{q C_{0}^{n} K^{n}}{K^{n} + C_{0}^{n} - q C_{0}^{n}} = \\frac{q C_{0}^{n} K^{n}}{K^{n} + (1-q)C_{0}^{n}}$`\nTaking the `$n$`-th root and substituting `$C(x_{\\mathrm{b}}) = C_{0} \\exp(-x_{\\mathrm{b}}/\\lambda)$`:\n`$C_{0} \\exp(-x_{\\mathrm{b}}/\\lambda) = C_{0} \\left( \\frac{q K^{n}}{K^{n} + (1-q)C_{0}^{n}} \\right)^{1/n}$`\n`$\\exp(-x_{\\mathrm{b}}/\\lambda) = \\left( \\frac{q}{1 + (1-q)(C_{0}/K)^{n}} \\right)^{1/n}$`\n`$-x_{\\mathrm{b}}/\\lambda = \\frac{1}{n} \\ln\\left( \\frac{q}{1 + (1-q)(C_{0}/K)^{n}} \\right)$`\n`$x_{\\mathrm{b}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{n} \\left[ \\ln\\left(1 + (1-q)\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right) - \\ln(q) \\right]$`\n\nThis is a general formula for the boundary position.\nFor the unperturbed embryo, `$x_{b,1}$` is given by this formula with `$C_{0}$`.\nFor the perturbed embryo, `$x_{b,2}$` is given by replacing `$C_{0}$` with `$C_{0}/2$`.
