Determine gene order.\n    2.  Compute map distances between adjacent genes.\n    3.  Compute a numerical value for interference, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is a standard exercise in linkage analysis and gene mapping, a fundamental topic in genetics. It is based on established Mendelian principles and the chromosomal theory of inheritance. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary data (progeny counts) and clear definitions for the quantities to be calculated (map distance, interference). The instructions are unambiguous, leading to a unique, stable solution.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and objective language, free of speculation or subjective claims.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid. It is a well-formulated, standard problem in quantitative genetics. Proceeding to solution.\n\nThe total number of progeny, $N$, is the sum of all observed classes:\n$$N = 662 + 661 + 98 + 99 + 218 + 219 + 21 + 22 = 2000$$\n\n**1. Determination of Gene Order**\nThe gene order is determined by comparing the parental gamete classes (non-crossovers, NCO) with the double crossover (DCO) gamete classes. Parental classes are the most frequent, and DCO classes are the least frequent.\n\n-   **Parental (NCO) classes**: The genotypes $A B C$ (count $662$) and $a b c$ (count $661$) are the most abundant. They represent the parental, non-recombinant gametes. Total NCO count is $662 + 661 = 1323$.\n-   **Double Crossover (DCO) classes**: The genotypes $A b C$ (count $21$) and $a B c$ (count $22$) are the least abundant. They result from simultaneous crossovers in the two intervals between the three genes. Total DCO count is $21 + 22 = 43$.\n\nTo find the middle gene, we compare a parental haplotype (e.g., $A B C$) with a double-crossover haplotype (e.g., $A b C$). The gene that differs between the two is the middle gene. Comparing $A B C$ and $A b C$, the alleles for loci $A$ and $C$ are unchanged, while the allele for locus $B$ is swapped. Therefore, locus $B$ is in the middle. The correct gene order is $A-B-C$.\n\n**2. Calculation of Map Distances**\nWith the gene order established as $A-B-C$, we can classify the single crossover (SCO) events.\n\n-   **Single Crossovers in Interval 1 ($A-B$)**: These classes show recombination between $A$ and $B$, but not between $B$ and $C$. The genotypes are $A b c$ and $a B C$. The total count for SCO in Interval 1 is $98 + 99 = 197$.\n-   **Single Crossovers in Interval 2 ($B-C$)**: These classes show recombination between $B$ and $C$, but not between $A$ and $B$. The genotypes are $A B c$ and $a b C$. The total count for SCO in Interval 2 is $218 + 219 = 437$.\n\nThe recombination frequency ($RF$) for an interval is the sum of SCOs for that interval and all DCOs, divided by the total number of progeny.\n\n-   **Map distance for Interval 1 ($d_{A-B}$)**:\nThe total number of recombinant progeny for the $A-B$ interval is the sum of SCO-1 and DCO counts.\n$$RF_{A-B} = \\frac{(\\text{SCO-1}) + (\\text{DCO})}{N} = \\frac{197 + 43}{2000} = \\frac{240}{2000} = 0.12$$\nThe map distance is:\n$$d_{A-B} = 100 \\times RF_{A-B} = 100 \\times 0.12 = 12 \\text{ cM}$$\n\n-   **Map distance for Interval 2 ($d_{B-C}$)**:\nThe total number of recombinant progeny for the $B-C$ interval is the sum of SCO-2 and DCO counts.\n$$RF_{B-C} = \\frac{(\\text{SCO-2}) + (\\text{DCO})}{N} = \\frac{437 + 43}{2000} = \\frac{480}{2000} = 0.24$$\nThe map distance is:\n$$d_{B-C} = 100 \\times RF_{B-C} = 100 \\times 0.24 = 24 \\text{ cM}$$\n\n**3. Calculation of Interference**\nInterference ($I$) measures the degree to which a crossover event in one interval affects the probability of a crossover event in an adjacent interval. It is calculated as $I = 1 - C$, where $C$ is the coefficient of coincidence.\n\n-   **Coefficient of Coincidence ($C$)**:\n$C$ is the ratio of the observed frequency of double crossovers to the expected frequency of double crossovers.\n$$C = \\frac{\\text{Observed DCO frequency}}{\\text{Expected DCO frequency}}$$\n\n-   **Observed DCO frequency ($f_{DCO, obs}$)**:\nThis is the observed number of DCO progeny divided by the total number of progeny.\n$$f_{DCO, obs} = \\frac{43}{2000} = 0.0215$$\n\n-   **Expected DCO frequency ($f_{DCO, exp}$)**:\nThis is calculated under the assumption of independence, meaning the probability of a double crossover is the product of the individual recombination frequencies of the two intervals.\n$$f_{DCO, exp} = RF_{A-B} \\times RF_{B-C} = 0.12 \\times 0.24 = 0.0288$$\n\n-   **Calculate $C$ and $I$**:\nNow, we can compute the coefficient of coincidence.\n$$C = \\frac{f_{DCO, obs}}{f_{DCO, exp}} = \\frac{0.0215}{0.0288} \\approx 0.7465277...$$\nFinally, the interference is calculated.\n$$I = 1 - C = 1 - \\frac{0.0215}{0.0288} = 1 - 0.7465277... = 0.2534722...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be reported as a pure decimal number rounded to four significant figures.\n$$I \\approx 0.2535$$\nThe positive value of interference indicates that a crossover in one interval suppresses the formation of a crossover in the adjacent interval, which is a common biological phenomenon.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.2535} $$", "id": "2840684"}, {"introduction": "Modern reverse genetics often employs pooled CRISPR screens to systematically assess the function of thousands of genes.

Completing the square for $\\theta_i$ in the exponent reveals a Normal posterior distribution with mean $E[\\theta_i|\\widehat{\\ell_i}] = \\frac{\\tau^2}{s_i^2+\\tau^2}\\widehat{\\ell_i}$.\nTo estimate $\\tau^2$, we use the method of moments. The marginal variance is $\\text{Var}(\\widehat{\\ell_i}) = \\tau^2 + s_i^2$. We equate the sample variance of the $\\widehat{\\ell_i}$, denoted $\\hat{V}_{\\ell}$, to the average theoretical variance: $\\hat{V}_{\\ell} = \\hat{\\tau}^2 + \\bar{s^2}$, where $\\bar{s^2} = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^m s_i^2$.\nThe average of the $\\widehat{\\ell_i}$ is $\\bar{\\ell} \\approx 0.1508$. The sample variance is $\\hat{V}_{\\ell} = \\frac{1}{m-1} \\sum (\\widehat{\\ell_i} - \\bar{\\ell})^2 \\approx 0.5014$. The mean of the sampling variances is $\\bar{s^2} \\approx 0.0848$.\nThe estimate for the prior variance is $\\hat{\\tau}^2 = \\max(0, \\hat{V}_{\\ell} - \\bar{s^2}) = \\max(0, 0.5014-0.0848) = 0.4166$.\nThe shrunken log-fold changes $\\widehat{\\ell}_{i, \\text{shrunk}} = \\frac{\\hat{\\tau}^2}{s_i^2+\\hat{\\tau}^2}\\widehat{\\ell_i}$ are:\n-   $\\widehat{\\ell}_{1,\\text{shrunk}} \\approx 0.9319$\n-   $\\widehat{\\ell}_{2,\\text{shrunk}} \\approx -0.1248$\n-   $\\widehat{\\ell}_{3,\\text{shrunk}} \\approx -0.9163$\n-   $\\widehat{\\ell}_{4,\\text{shrunk}} \\approx 0.1098$\n-   $\\widehat{\\ell}_{5,\\text{shrunk}} \\approx -0.1249$\n-   $\\widehat{\\ell}_{6,\\text{shrunk}} \\approx 0.9482$\n-   $\\widehat{\\ell}_{7,\\text{shrunk}} \\approx 0.1436$\n-   $\\widehat{\\ell}_{8,\\text{shrunk}} \\approx -0.0519$\n\n4. Compute two-sided p-values using the Wald statistic $z_i$.\nFor hypothesis testing of $H_0: \\theta_i=0$, we use the unshrunken estimates. The Wald statistic is $z_i = \\widehat{\\ell_i}/s_i$, which under $H_0$ follows a standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ for large samples. The two-sided p-value is $p_i = 2P(Z > |z_i|)$ for $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\nThe statistics and p-values are:\n-   $z_1 \\approx 8.097$, $p_1 \\approx 5.6 \\times 10^{-16}$\n-   $z_2 \\approx -0.832$, $p_2 \\approx 0.4056$\n-   $z_3 \\approx -4.139$, $p_3 \\approx 3.49 \\times 10^{-5}$\n-   $z_4 \\approx 0.514$, $p_4 \\approx 0.6071$\n-   $z_5 \\approx -1.246$, $p_5 \\approx 0.2128$\n-   $z_6 \\approx 3.492$, $p_6 \\approx 4.80 \\times 10^{-4}$\n-   $z_7 \\approx 0.447$, $p_7 \\approx 0.6549$\n-   $z_8 \\approx -0.312$, $p_8 \\approx 0.7552$\n\n5. Apply the Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) procedure.\nWe control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) at $q=0.05$ across the $m=8$ tests. First, we sort the p-values in ascending order: $p_{(1)} \\le p_{(2)} \\le \\dots \\le p_{(m)}$.\n-   $p_{(1)} = 5.6 \\times 10^{-16}$ (Gene 1)\n-   $p_{(2)} = 3.49 \\times 10^{-5}$ (Gene 3)\n-   $p_{(3)} = 4.80 \\times 10^{-4}$ (Gene 6)\n-   $p_{(4)} = 0.2128$ (Gene 5)\n-   $p_{(5)} = 0.4056$ (Gene 2)\n-   $p_{(6)} = 0.6071$ (Gene 4)\n-   $p_{(7)} = 0.6549$ (Gene 7)\n-   $p_{(8)} = 0.7552$ (Gene 8)\n\nNext, we find the largest integer $k$ such that $p_{(k)} \\le \\frac{k}{m}q$. With $m=8$ and $q=0.05$, the BH threshold is $\\frac{k}{8}(0.05)$.\n-   For $k=1$: $p_{(1)} = 5.6 \\times 10^{-16} \\le \\frac{1}{8}(0.05) = 0.00625$. Condition is met.\n-   For $k=2$: $p_{(2)} = 3.49 \\times 10^{-5} \\le \\frac{2}{8}(0.05) = 0.0125$. Condition is met.\n-   For $k=3$: $p_{(3)} = 4.80 \\times 10^{-4} \\le \\frac{3}{8}(0.05) = 0.01875$. Condition is met.\n-   For $k=4$: $p_{(4)} = 0.2128 \\le \\frac{4}{8}(0.05) = 0.025$. Condition is not met.\n\nThe largest value of $k$ that satisfies the condition is $k=3$. According to the BH procedure, we reject the null hypotheses for the first $k=3$ genes in the sorted list. These correspond to genes $1$, $3$, and $6$. The total number of genes called significant is $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2840676"}]}
