It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains all necessary information and definitions to permit a rigorous derivation of the required quantities from first principles. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nWe begin by establishing the genetic and chromosomal state of the diploid somatic cell. The cell is heterozygous for two linked recessive markers, $a$ and $b$, in repulsion phase. The genotype is given as $a+ / +b$. This signifies that one homologous chromosome, which we shall call $H_1$, carries the alleles $a$ and $+$, while the other homolog, $H_2$, carries the alleles $+$ and $b$. Both markers are located on the same chromosome arm, distal to the centromere. Let the centromere be denoted by $\\circ$. The configuration of the homologs in the $G_1$ phase is:\n$$H_1: \\circ - a - +$$\n$$H_2: \\circ - + - b$$\nIn the $G_2$ phase, after DNA replication, each chromosome consists of two identical sister chromatids.\n- The chromosome derived from $H_1$ consists of two sister chromatids, both with the genotype $\\circ_1 - a - +$, where $\\circ_1$ represents the centromere of $H_1$.\n- The chromosome derived from $H_2$ consists of two sister chromatids, both with the genotype $\\circ_2 - + - b$, where $\\circ_2$ represents the centromere of $H_2$.\n\nA single reciprocal crossover occurs between two nonsister chromatids at a site between the centromere and both markers. Let us assume the crossover happens between one chromatid from the $H_1$ pair and one from the $H_2$ pair. After this exchange, the four chromatids present at the metaphase plate are:\n1.  One parental non-recombinant chromatid (PNR): $C_{PNR1}$ with genotype $\\circ_1 - a - +$.\n2.  One parental non-recombinant chromatid (PNR): $C_{PNR2}$ with genotype $\\circ_2 - + - b$.\n3.  One recombinant chromatid (R): $C_{R1}$ with genotype $\\circ_1 - + - b$.\n4.  One recombinant chromatid (R): $C_{R2}$ with genotype $\\circ_2 - a - +$.\n\nThe chromatids $C_{PNR1}$ and $C_{R1}$ share the centromere $\\circ_1$ and constitute one replicated chromosome. The chromatids $C_{R2}$ and $C_{PNR2}$ share the centromere $\\circ_2$ and constitute the other replicated homologous chromosome.\n\nThe segregation of these chromatids during anaphase is governed by two principles stated in the problem:\n1.  Sister chromatid disjunction: The two kinetochores of a given centromere ($\\circ_1$ or $\\circ_2$) must attach to opposite spindle poles. This ensures that $C_{PNR1}$ and $C_{R1}$ segregate to opposite poles, and likewise for $C_{R2}$ and $C_{PNR2}$.\n2.  Random assortment: The orientation of the centromere pair $\\circ_1$ with respect to the spindle poles is independent of the orientation of the centromere pair $\\circ_2$.\n\nLet the two spindle poles be $P_A$ and $P_B$. For the $\\circ_1$ pair, there are two equally likely segregation possibilities: ($C_{PNR1} \\to P_A$, $C_{R1} \\to P_B$) or ($C_{PNR1} \\to P_B$, $C_{R1} \\to P_A$). Similarly, for the $\\circ_2$ pair, the two possibilities are: ($C_{R2} \\to P_A$, $C_{PNR2} \\to P_B$) or ($C_{R2} \\to P_B$, $C_{PNR2} \\to P_A$). Since these choices are independent, there are $2 \\times 2 = 4$ equally probable combinations for the segregation of the four chromatids into two daughter cells.\n\nWe enumerate these four outcomes:\n-   **Outcome 1**: ($C_{PNR1} \\to P_A$, $C_{R1} \\to P_B$) and ($C_{R2} \\to P_A$, $C_{PNR2} \\to P_B$).\n    -   Daughter cell $1$ (from $P_A$) receives $C_{PNR1}$ and $C_{R2}$.\n    -   Daughter cell $2$ (from $P_B$) receives $C_{R1}$ and $C_{PNR2}$.\n    -   The recombinant chromatids $C_{R1}$ and $C_{R2}$ segregate to opposite poles. This is defined as **X segregation**.\n\n-   **Outcome 2**: ($C_{PNR1} \\to P_A$, $C_{R1} \\to P_B$) and ($C_{R2} \\to P_B$, $C_{PNR2} \\to P_A$).\n    -   Daughter cell $1$ (from $P_A$) receives $C_{PNR1}$ and $C_{PNR2}$.\n    -   Daughter cell $2$ (from $P_B$) receives $C_{R1}$ and $C_{R2}$.\n    -   The recombinant chromatids $C_{R1}$ and $C_{R2}$ segregate to the same pole ($P_B$). This is defined as **Z segregation**.\n\n-   **Outcome 3**: ($C_{PNR1} \\to P_B$, $C_{R1} \\to P_A$) and ($C_{R2} \\to P_A$, $C_{PNR2} \\to P_B$).\n    -   Daughter cell $1$ (from $P_A$) receives $C_{R1}$ and $C_{R2}$.\n    -   Daughter cell $2$ (from $P_B$) receives $C_{PNR1}$ and $C_{PNR2}$.\n    -   The recombinant chromatids $C_{R1}$ and $C_{R2}$ segregate to the same pole ($P_A$). This is **Z segregation**.\n\n-   **Outcome 4**: ($C_{PNR1} \\to P_B$, $C_{R1} \\to P_A$) and ($C_{R2} \\to P_B$, $C_{PNR2} \\to P_A$).\n    -   Daughter cell $1$ (from $P_A$) receives $C_{R1}$ and $C_{PNR2}$.\n    -   Daughter cell $2$ (from $P_B$) receives $C_{PNR1}$ and $C_{R2}$.\n    -   The recombinant chromatids $C_{R1}$ and $C_{R2}$ segregate to opposite poles. This is **X segregation**.\n\nOut of the $4$ total equiprobable segregation patterns, $2$ result in X segregation and $2$ result in Z segregation. The probabilities are therefore:\n$$P_X = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$P_Z = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nNext, we identify which segregation class yields twin spots. A twin spot is a pair of adjacent cell clones, one homozygous for marker $a$ (genotype $a/a$) and the other homozygous for marker $b$ (genotype $b/b$). Given that the markers are recessive and cell-autonomous, these genotypes translate directly to phenotypes $a$ and $b$, respectively. The parental cell of genotype $a+/+b$ is phenotypically wild-type.\n\n-   **Analysis of Z segregation (Outcomes 2 and 3)**: One daughter cell receives the two parental chromatids {$C_{PNR1}$, $C_{PNR2}$}, with genotypes $a+$ and $+b$. The cell genotype is $a+/+b$. The other daughter cell receives the two recombinant chromatids {$C_{R1}$, $C_{R2}$}, with genotypes $+b$ and $a+$. Its genotype is also effectively $a+/+b$. Both daughter cells are heterozygous and phenotypically wild-type. No homozygous clones are produced.\n\n-   **Analysis of X segregation (Outcomes 1 and 4)**: One daughter cell receives chromatids {$C_{PNR1}$, $C_{R2}$}. Both chromatids have the genotype $a+$. The resulting cellular genotype is $a+/a+$, which is homozygous $a/a$. This cell will express the phenotype $a$. The other daughter cell receives chromatids {$C_{R1}$, $C_{PNR2}$}. Both chromatids have the genotype $+b$. The resulting cellular genotype is $+b/+b$, which is homozygous $b/b$. This cell will express the phenotype $b$. Thus, X segregation results in two daughter cells that are reciprocally homozygous, giving rise to a twin spot.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected twin spot frequency per crossover event. A single crossover event between the centromere and the markers results in one of four equally likely segregation outcomes at the subsequent mitosis. Twin spots are produced if and only if X segregation occurs. The probability of this is $P_X$. Therefore, the frequency of twin spots per initiating crossover event is precisely $P_X$.\n\nExpected twin spot frequency per crossover event $= P_X = \\frac{1}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "2830498"}, {"introduction": "The principles of mitotic recombination are not merely theoretical; they provide a powerful method for genetic mapping in somatic cells.

Consider G2 mitotic recombination between homologs, followed by mitosis in which segregation of recombinant chromatids yields visible loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) clones.\n\nFundamental facts for this system are as follows:\n- Twin spots arise when a mitotic crossover occurs proximal to both assayed markers (i.e., between the centromere and the more proximal of the two), in a trans-heterozygote, yielding two adjacent reciprocal LOH sectors, each homozygous for one of the two recessive markers.\n- A single double-mutant sector (for the pair being assayed) arises when a mitotic crossover occurs in the interval between the two markers, producing one visible double-mutant sector and its wild-type sister sector.\n- Crossovers distal to both markers do not produce LOH at either marker and are not scorable in assays that detect only the two assayed markers.\n\nAssume the following modeling assumptions:\n- The crossover position along the arm is a continuous random variable uniformly distributed with respect to physical distance along $[0,1]$.\n- Only single crossovers within the arm occur within the scoring window.\n- Only events that generate sectors mutant for at least one of the assayed markers are scored, and the counts below reflect the outcomes aggregated over many independent clones.\n\nThree independent twin-spot assays are performed under identical conditions, each assaying a pair of markers for visible outcomes as defined above. The observed data are:\n- Pair $\\{A,C\\}$: among $170$ scorable events, $50$ are twin spots.\n- Pair $\\{B,C\\}$: among $100$ scorable events, $50$ are twin spots.\n- Pair $\\{A,B\\}$: among $170$ scorable events, $100$ are twin spots.\n\nUsing only the fundamental facts and modeling assumptions stated above, and starting from first principles:\n1.

Express the final distance in megabases (MB).", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is determined to be a well-posed, self-contained problem in genetics, based on a simplified but clearly articulated model of mitotic recombination. It is scientifically grounded and internally consistent, permitting a unique solution.\n\nLet the positions of the markers $A$, $B$, and $C$ on the chromosome arm be denoted by the continuous variables $x_A$, $x_B$, and $x_C$, respectively. These positions represent the fractional distance from the centromere, which is at position $0$, along an arm of total length $1$. We are given $x_C = 0.1$. The location of a mitotic crossover, $X$, is a random variable uniformly distributed on $[0, 1]$.\n\nThe problem defines the outcomes based on the crossover position relative to two markers, say $M_1$ and $M_2$, at positions $x_1$ and $x_2$.

Twin spots result from a crossover in the interval $(0, x_{prox})$.\n2.  Single double-mutant sectors result from a crossover in the interval $(x_{prox}, x_{dist})$.\n3.  Crossovers in $(x_{dist}, 1)$ are not scorable.\n\nThe set of scorable events thus corresponds to crossovers occurring in the interval $(0, x_{dist})$. The probability of a crossover in an interval $(u, v)$ is proportional to its length, $v-u$. Therefore:\n- The probability of a twin-spot event is proportional to $x_{prox}$.\n- The probability of a single-spot event is proportional to $x_{dist} - x_{prox}$.\n- The probability of any scorable event is proportional to $x_{prox} + (x_{dist} - x_{prox}) = x_{dist}$.\n\nThe frequency of twin spots, $F_{TS}$, among all scorable events is the ratio of these probabilities:\n$$F_{TS} = \\frac{P(\\text{crossover in } (0, x_{prox}))}{P(\\text{crossover in } (0, x_{dist}))} = \\frac{x_{prox}}{x_{dist}}$$\nThis theoretical frequency can be estimated from the experimental data as the ratio of the number of observed twin spots ($T$) to the total number of scorable events ($N$).\n\nWe apply this model to the three datasets provided.\n\n**1.

This implies that the total number of cells screened for mitotic events is proportional across experiments. The number of scorable events observed, $N$, is proportional to the probability of a scorable event, which is itself proportional to $x_{dist}$. Thus, for some constant of proportionality $K$ reflecting the scale of the experiment, $N = K \\cdot x_{dist}$. The ratios of the total scorable events must be equal to the ratios of the distal marker distances.\nWe test our two scenarios against this condition using the data $N_{AC}=170$, $N_{BC}=100$, $N_{AB}=170$.\n\n- **Test Scenario 1**: ($x_A \\approx 0.0294$, $x_B = 0.05$, $x_C = 0.1$)\n  $x_{dist(A,C)} = \\max(x_A, x_C) = 0.1$.\n  $x_{dist(B,C)} = \\max(x_B, x_C) = 0.1$.\n  $x_{dist(A,B)} = \\max(x_A, x_B) = 0.05$.\n  The predicted ratio of scorable events is $N_{AC}:N_{BC}:N_{AB} = 0.1:0.1:0.05 = 2:2:1$.\n  The observed ratio is $170:100:170$.

This is a perfect match.\n\nScenario 2 is the unique valid solution. The marker positions are $x_A = 0.34$ and $x_B = 0.2$.\n\nWith these positions, we can answer the questions posed.\n\n**1. Inference of Proximality:**\nThe position represents distance from the centromere at $0$. To determine which of $A$ or $B$ is more proximal, we compare their positions.\n$x_B = 0.2$ and $x_A = 0.34$.\nSince $0.2 < 0.34$, $x_B < x_A$.\nTherefore, marker **B** is more proximal to the centromere than marker A.\n\n**2.

Successfully navigating this problem requires a nuanced understanding of how different molecular mechanisms leave distinct genetic signatures in flanking markers.", "problem": "A diploid somatic cell is heterozygous at three linked loci arranged on a single chromosome arm in the order centromere–$P$–$g$–$D$–telomere. The diploid genotype is $P/p \\; g^{+}/g \\; D/d$, where $g$ is a recessive loss-of-function allele that produces a visible cell-autonomous phenotype when homozygous, and $P$ and $D$ are codominant single-nucleotide polymorphism markers that can be genotyped. You screen a large field of genetically identical such diploid cells in vivo and recover a single small clonal patch showing the $g$ recessive phenotype, with no adjacent reciprocal patch of enhanced wild-type phenotype.\n\nUse the following fundamentals to reason from first principles:\n\n- In mitotic homologous recombination, double-strand break repair can proceed by formation and resolution of Holliday junction intermediates, yielding either crossover or noncrossover outcomes. Noncrossover outcomes can be accompanied by gene conversion, defined as nonreciprocal transfer of sequence information that can produce loss of heterozygosity confined to the conversion tract. Mismatch repair of heteroduplex DNA can generate conversion tracts of limited size, often intragenic or spanning only several kilobases.\n\n- Mitotic crossing over between homologous chromosomes generally leads to reciprocal loss-of-heterozygosity distal to the exchange site in the two daughter lineages after the next mitosis, producing adjacent twin spots if the markers are cell-autonomous and viable.\n\n- In diploid somatic tissue, expression of a recessive phenotype from $g$ requires homozygosity for $g$ within the clonal patch; surrounding tissue retaining $g^{+}/g$ remains phenotypically wild-type at $g$.\n\nBased on these principles, select all statements that are most consistent with mitotic gene conversion without crossover as the cause of the single-spot mosaic, and identify marker configurations that would allow you to detect and distinguish such events from mitotic crossovers.\n\nA. In the described $P/p \\; g^{+}/g \\; D/d$ background with order centromere–$P$–$g$–$D$–telomere, a noncrossover gene conversion event that converts $g^{+} \\to g$ on one chromatid after DNA replication can yield a single daughter clone that is $g/g$ while remaining $P/p$ and $D/d$. Therefore, observing the mutant patch as $P/p$, $g/g$, $D/d$ and the surrounding tissue as $P/p$, $g^{+}/g$, $D/d$ strongly supports noncrossover gene conversion.\n\nB. To specifically detect noncrossover gene conversion and distinguish it from crossover-induced twin spots, it is necessary to place $P$ and $D$ in repulsion phase with $g$ (that is, $P \\; g^{+} \\; D$ on one homolog and $p \\; g \\; d$ on the other); otherwise, gene conversion cannot be identified unambiguously.\n\nC. A genotype pattern in the mutant patch of $P/p$, $g/g$, $D/D$ with no detectable reciprocal $d/d$ twin patch is most parsimoniously explained by a single noncrossover gene conversion at $g$ followed by a mitotic crossover between $g$ and $D$.\n\nD. The optimal marker configuration to diagnose noncrossover gene conversion at $g$ and discriminate it from mitotic crossing over is to maintain heterozygosity at both $P/p$ and $D/d$ and to include at least two intragenic codominant polymorphisms within $g$. A single-spot clone showing either complete homozygosity at $g$ or restricted $3\\!:\\!1$ or $1\\!:\\!3$ allele ratios at intragenic sites confined to $g$ while $P/p$ and $D/d$ remain heterozygous uniquely indicates a noncrossover conversion tract.\n\nE. Because noncrossover gene conversion tracts in mitosis can span several kilobases, the mutant patch will always be homozygous for at least one flanking marker ($P$ or $D$) as well as $g$, making twin spots inevitable even without crossing over.\n\nSelect all that apply.

The problem does not specify the linkage phase, so we will consider a general case. Let one homolog carry the haplotype $H_1$ and the other carry $H_2$. For example, let's assume the parental genotype is $P g^{+} D / p g d$.\n\nBefore mitosis, the cell is in the G2 phase after DNA replication. There are four chromatids: two sister chromatids for each homolog.\n- Homolog 1: Two chromatids, both $P-g^{+}-D$\n- Homolog 2: Two chromatids, both $p-g-d$\n\n**Mechanism 1: Mitotic Crossing Over**\nA mitotic crossover event involves a physical exchange between non-sister chromatids. If a crossover occurs between the centromere and the $P$ locus, followed by segregation that leads to LOH, the daughter cells will exhibit homozygosity for all loci distal to the exchange point. For a starting genotype of $P g^{+} D / p g d$, this would generate one daughter cell lineage that is homozygous $p/p, g/g, d/d$, and a \"twin\" daughter cell lineage that is homozygous $P/P, g^{+}/g^{+}, D/D$. This creates a $g/g$ spot, but it is adjacent to a reciprocal twin spot, which contradicts the observation that no twin spot was found. Therefore, a simple mitotic crossover is not the primary cause.\n\n**Mechanism 2: Noncrossover Gene Conversion**\nGene conversion is a nonreciprocal process where a sequence from one chromatid is used as a template to \"correct\" the sequence on another chromatid, typically during double-strand break repair. This occurs without the exchange of flanking markers (a noncrossover event).\nLet's analyze this for the given genotype. To obtain a $g/g$ phenotype, the wild-type $g^{+}$ allele must be lost or converted. The event is thus the conversion of $g^{+} \\to g$. This event must occur on a chromatid carrying the $g^{+}$ allele, using a chromatid carrying the $g$ allele as a template.\nLet's trace the chromatids after replication and a noncrossover gene conversion event where $g^{+} \\to g$ on one chromatid:\n- Original chromatids: $P-g^{+}-D$, $P-g^{+}-D$, $p-g-d$, $p-g-d$.\n- After conversion of one $P-g^{+}-D$ chromatid: $P-g^{+}-D$, $P-g-D$, $p-g-d$, $p-g-d$.\nAt anaphase, sister chromatids separate. Let's assume the centromeres align such that one daughter cell receives the chromatids $P-g^{+}-D$ and $p-g-d$, and the other daughter cell receives $P-g-D$ and $p-g-d$.\n- **Daughter Cell 1:** Genotype is $P/p \\; g^{+}/g \\; D/d$. This cell is phenotypically wild-type and continues to form the background tissue.\n- **Daughter Cell 2:** Genotype is $P/p \\; g/g \\; D/d$. This cell is homozygous for $g$ and will proliferate to form a clonal patch exhibiting the recessive phenotype.\n\nThis mechanism produces a single mutant spot ($g/g$) without a reciprocal twin spot. Critically, the flanking markers ($P/p$ and $D/d$) remain heterozygous in the mutant clone, assuming the conversion tract is limited to the $g$ locus.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In the described $P/p \\; g^{+}/g \\; D/d$ background with order centromere–$P$–$g$–$D$–telomere, a noncrossover gene conversion event that converts $g^{+} \\to g$ on one chromatid after DNA replication can yield a single daughter clone that is $g/g$ while remaining $P/p$ and $D/d$. Therefore, observing the mutant patch as $P/p$, $g/g$, $D/d$ and the surrounding tissue as $P/p$, $g^{+}/g$, $D/d$ strongly supports noncrossover gene conversion.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement perfectly matches the derivation above. A noncrossover gene conversion event limited to the $g$ locus generates one $g/g$ daughter cell and one wild-type daughter cell. The $g/g$ cell is heterozygous for the flanking markers. This outcome aligns exactly with the observation of a single spot without a twin. The described genotype of the spot is the key evidence differentiating this event from a crossover.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. To specifically detect noncrossover gene conversion and distinguish it from crossover-induced twin spots, it is necessary to place $P$ and $D$ in repulsion phase with $g$ (that is, $P \\; g^{+} \\; D$ on one homolog and $p \\; g \\; d$ on the other); otherwise, gene conversion cannot be identified unambiguously.**\n- **Analysis:** The ability to distinguish noncrossover gene conversion from a crossover relies on the state of the flanking markers. As shown in the analysis for A, gene conversion at $g$ yields a spot that is $P/p \\; g/g \\; D/d$. A crossover between the centromere and $g$ would yield a spot homozygous for all distal markers. The key diagnostic feature is that the $g/g$ spot remains heterozygous for flanking markers in the case of gene conversion, whereas it becomes homozygous for distal markers in the case of a crossover. This distinction is possible regardless of the linkage phase (coupling or repulsion), as long as the parent cell is heterozygous for the markers. The linkage phase only determines which alleles become homozygous in a crossover event (e.g., $p$ and $d$, or $p$ and $D$), it does not affect the diagnostic principle. Therefore, a specific phase is not *necessary*.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. A genotype pattern in the mutant patch of $P/p$, $g/g$, $D/D$ with no detectable reciprocal $d/d$ twin patch is most parsimoniously explained by a single noncrossover gene conversion at $g$ followed by a mitotic crossover between $g$ and $D$.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement proposes a two-event explanation: a gene conversion followed by a crossover. This is not parsimonious, as mitotic recombination events are rare. More importantly, a mitotic crossover between $g$ and $D$ would itself produce a twin spot (a $D/D$ spot and a $d/d$ spot), which contradicts the problem's premise of \"no detectable reciprocal patch\". A more parsimonious explanation for the $P/p, g/g, D/D$ genotype is a single, noncrossover gene conversion event with a conversion tract long enough to span both the $g$ and $D$ loci. This would require a starting genotype of, for example, $p g D / P g^{+} d$, and a conversion of $g^{+} \\to g$ and $d \\to D$. This single event would produce a single $P/p\\; g/g\\; D/D$ spot. The explanation offered in the option is flawed and not the most parsimonious.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. The optimal marker configuration to diagnose noncrossover gene conversion at $g$ and discriminate it from mitotic crossing over is to maintain heterozygosity at both $P/p$ and $D/d$ and to include at least two intragenic codominant polymorphisms within $g$. A single-spot clone showing either complete homozygosity at $g$ or restricted $3\\!:\\!1$ or $1\\!:\\!3$ allele ratios at intragenic sites confined to $g$ while $P/p$ and $D/d$ remain heterozygous uniquely indicates a noncrossover conversion tract.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement describes a rigorous experimental design. Maintaining heterozygosity at flanking markers is essential to rule out crossing over (as discussed for A and B). The inclusion of intragenic markers provides higher resolution. A gene conversion event can convert the entire gene, leading to complete homozygosity. Alternatively, if the heteroduplex DNA formed during repair is not corrected before the next cell division, it can lead to sectoring within the clonal patch, where some cells are mutant and some are wild-type. In a population of cells derived from such an event, this would be detected as mixed allele ratios (a `3:1` or `1:3` ratio of the original chromatid types). Observing these phenomena confined to the $g$ locus while flanking markers $P$ and $D$ remain heterozygous is the strongest possible evidence for a noncrossover gene conversion event. This is indeed an optimal diagnostic strategy.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**E. Because noncrossover gene conversion tracts in mitosis can span several kilobases, the mutant patch will always be homozygous for at least one flanking marker ($P$ or $D$) as well as $g$, making twin spots inevitable even without crossing over.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement contains two major falsehoods. First, the word \"always\" is incorrect. While conversion tracts *can* be long and lead to co-conversion of a linked marker (as discussed for C), they are often short and confined to a single gene. The problem explicitly states tracts are of \"limited size\". Therefore, it is not \"always\" the case that a flanking marker becomes homozygous. The outcome described in option A (heterozygous flanking markers) is a common expectation. Second, and more fundamentally, noncrossover events do not produce twin spots. Twin spots are the hallmark of a reciprocal exchange, i.e., a crossover. The absence of a crossover is precisely why only a single spot is formed. This statement fundamentally misrepresents the genetic consequences of a noncrossover event.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2830457"}]}
