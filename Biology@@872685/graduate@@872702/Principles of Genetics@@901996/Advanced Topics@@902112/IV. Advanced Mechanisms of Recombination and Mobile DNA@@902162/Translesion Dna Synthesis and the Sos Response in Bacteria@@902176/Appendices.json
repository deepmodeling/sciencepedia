Consider an Escherichia coli (E. coli) promoter for a translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) gene in which LexA binds a single SOS box with simple one-to-one stoichiometry. Assume the following:\n\n- LexA binding to the SOS box is a rapid equilibrium process governed by the dissociation constant $K_{d}$, defined by the law of mass action for the reaction $\\text{LexA} + \\text{SOS box} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{LexA}:\\text{SOS box}$.\n- The total number of operator sites per promoter is fixed and low such that site occupancy can be treated using equilibrium binding thermodynamics.\n- Binding of LexA to the SOS box is mutually exclusive with productive binding of ribonucleic acid polymerase (RNAP), so that when LexA is bound, transcription initiation is effectively zero; when LexA is not bound, the promoter produces a basal transcriptional output that we normalize to one (arbitrary units), representing the “fully derepressed” basal state.\n- The intracellular free LexA concentration is uniform and denoted $[\\text{LexA}]$.\n\nStarting only from the mass action definition of the dissociation constant and site conservation, derive the fractional occupancy $f$ of the SOS box by LexA as a function of $[\\text{LexA}]$ and $K_{d}$.

Let $[L]$ denote the molar concentration of free LexA protein, which is given as the variable $[\\text{LexA}]$. Let $[S]$ denote the concentration of free SOS boxes, and $[LS]$ denote the concentration of the LexA:SOS box complex. The reversible binding reaction is given by:\n$$\nL + S \\rightleftharpoons LS\n$$\nAccording to the law of mass action, the dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined as:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{[L][S]}{[LS]}\n$$\nThe problem states we are to use the variable name $[\\text{LexA}]$ for the free LexA concentration, so we write:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{[\\text{LexA}][S]}{[LS]}\n$$\nThe total concentration of SOS boxes, $[S]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the concentrations of free (unbound) sites and bound sites:\n$$\n[S]_{\\text{total}} = [S] + [LS]\n$$\nThe fractional occupancy, $f$, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of bound sites to the total concentration of sites.\n$$\nf = \\frac{[LS]}{[S]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[LS]}{[S] + [LS]}\n$$\nTo express $f$ as a function of $[\\text{LexA}]$ and $K_d$, we must eliminate $[S]$ and $[LS]$.

This form is equivalent to the Langmuir binding isotherm for a $1:1$ stoichiometric interaction.\n\nNext, we must determine the basal expression level relative to the fully derepressed state. The problem states that binding of LexA to the SOS box is mutually exclusive with productive binding of RNA polymerase. Transcription is therefore blocked when LexA is bound. The transcriptional output is thus proportional to the fraction of SOS boxes that are *not* bound by LexA. This fraction is given by $(1 - f)$.\nLet $E$ be the expression level. The problem normalizes the expression level of the \"fully derepressed\" state (i.e., when no LexA is present, such that $f=0$) to $1$. Therefore, the expression level $E$ is directly equal to the fraction of unbound sites:\n$$\nE = 1 - f\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $f$:\n$$\nE = 1 - \\frac{[\\text{LexA}]}{K_d + [\\text{LexA}]}\n$$\nWe can combine these terms over a common denominator:\n$$\nE = \\frac{(K_d + [\\text{LexA}]) - [\\text{LexA}]}{K_d + [\\text{LexA}]} = \\frac{K_d}{K_d + [\\text{LexA}]}\n$$\nThis expression gives the basal expression level relative to the fully derepressed state of $1$.\n\nFinally, we are required to evaluate this expression numerically for the given values: $[\\text{LexA}] = 400$ nM and $K_d = 20$ nM.
