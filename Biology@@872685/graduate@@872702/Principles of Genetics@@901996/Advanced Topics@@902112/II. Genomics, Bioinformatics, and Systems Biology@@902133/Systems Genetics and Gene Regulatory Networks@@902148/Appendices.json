The denominator, $[P] + [\\mathrm{TF}\\!\\cdot\\!P]$, represents the total promoter concentration, $[P]_{\\mathrm{total}}$.\n- An approximation is made: the total promoter concentration is negligible compared to the total transcription factor concentration, therefore the free transcription factor concentration, $[\\mathrm{TF}]$, is effectively constant and equal to the total nuclear TF concentration.\n- The task is to derive an expression for $P_{\\mathrm{bound}}$ as a function of $K_d$ and $[\\mathrm{TF}]$.\n- Numerical values are provided for evaluation: $K_d = 20\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and $[\\mathrm{TF}] = 30\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n- The final numerical answer must be an exact fraction.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is assessed for its validity.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in the principles of chemical kinetics and molecular biology. The model described is a standard, simplified representation of transcription factor-promoter binding, often referred to as the Hill-Langmuir isotherm for a single site. The assumptions of quasi-equilibrium and negligible TF depletion are common and valid approximations in this context.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides clear definitions, sufficient data, and a specific objective. A unique and meaningful solution can be determined.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using objective and precise scientific language.\n\nThe problem is free of scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, and internal contradictions. All givens are consistent and sufficient for deriving a solution.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation begins from the provided first principles: the definition of the dissociation constant, $K_d$, and the definition of fractional occupancy, $P_{\\mathrm{bound}}$. The objective is to express $P_{\\mathrm{bound}}$ in terms of $[\\mathrm{TF}]$ and $K_d$.\n\nThe dissociation constant is given by:\n$$K_d = \\dfrac{[\\mathrm{TF}][P]}{[\\mathrm{TF}\\!\\cdot\\!P]}$$\nHere, $[P]$ is the concentration of the free (unbound) promoter and $[\\mathrm{TF}\\!\\cdot\\!P]$ is the concentration of the bound complex. We can rearrange this equation to express the concentration of the free promoter in terms of the bound complex and other parameters:\n$$[P] = K_d \\dfrac{[\\mathrm{TF}\\!\\cdot\\!P]}{[\\mathrm{TF}]}$$\n\nThe fractional occupancy, which represents the probability of the promoter being bound, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of bound promoter to the total concentration of promoter:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\dfrac{[\\mathrm{TF}\\!\\cdot\\!P]}{[P]_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\dfrac{[\\mathrm{TF}\\!\\cdot\\!P]}{[P] + [\\mathrm{TF}\\!\\cdot\\!P]}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $[P]$ from the rearranged $K_d$ equation into the denominator of the $P_{\\mathrm{bound}}$ equation:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\dfrac{[\\mathrm{TF}\\!\\cdot\\!P]}{\\left(K_d \\dfrac{[\\mathrm{TF}\\!\\cdot\\!P]}{[\\mathrm{TF}]}\\right) + [\\mathrm{TF}\\!\\cdot\\!P]}$$\n\nThe term $[\\mathrm{TF}\\!\\cdot\\!P]$ appears in the numerator and in both terms of the denominator. Assuming a non-zero concentration of transcription factor, which implies a non-zero possibility of binding, $[\\mathrm{TF}\\!\\cdot\\!P]$ is not zero and can be factored out from the denominator and cancelled:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\dfrac{[\\mathrm{TF}\\!\\cdot\\!P]}{[\\mathrm{TF}\\!\\cdot\\!P] \\left(\\dfrac{K_d}{[\\mathrm{TF}]} + 1\\right)} = \\dfrac{1}{\\dfrac{K_d}{[\\mathrm{TF}]} + 1}$$\n\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we find a common denominator for the terms in the denominator:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\dfrac{1}{\\dfrac{K_d + [\\mathrm{TF}]}{[\\mathrm{TF}]}}$$\n\nFinally, inverting the denominator yields the expression for $P_{\\mathrm{bound}}$ in terms of $K_d$ and $[\\mathrm{TF}]$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\dfrac{[\\mathrm{TF}]}{K_d + [\\mathrm{TF}]}$$\nThis is the required analytical expression. This is a specific case of the Hill-Langmuir equation with a Hill coefficient of $1$.\n\nThe problem now requires a numerical evaluation for the given values $K_d = 20\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and $[\\mathrm{TF}] = 30\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.

Define the functions $f(x)$ and $f'(x)$ for the given parameters $(\\alpha, \\beta, K, n)$.\n2. The search for positive fixed points can be restricted to a finite interval $[0, X_{\\max}]$. A fixed point $x^\\ast$ must satisfy $\\beta x^\\ast = \\alpha \\frac{(x^\\ast)^n}{K^n + (x^\\ast)^n}$. Since the Hill function term is strictly less than $1$ for any finite $x^\\ast$, we must have $\\beta x^\\ast < \\alpha$, which implies $x^\\ast < \\alpha / \\beta$. Therefore, all positive fixed points are guaranteed to lie in the interval $(0, \\alpha/\\beta)$. We choose a search interval $[0, X_{\\max}]$ where $X_{\\max}$ is slightly larger than $\\alpha/\\beta$ to be safe, for instance $X_{\\max} = \\alpha/\\beta$.\n3. We systematically search for roots of $f(x)$ in the interval $(0, X_{\\max}]$. A robust method is to partition the interval into a fine grid and detect sign changes of $f(x)$ between adjacent grid points. A sign change indicates the presence of a root, which can be located precisely using a standard root-finding algorithm like Brent's method.\n4. All found positive roots, along with the trivial root $x^\\ast_0=0$, constitute the complete set of non-negative fixed points.\n5.
