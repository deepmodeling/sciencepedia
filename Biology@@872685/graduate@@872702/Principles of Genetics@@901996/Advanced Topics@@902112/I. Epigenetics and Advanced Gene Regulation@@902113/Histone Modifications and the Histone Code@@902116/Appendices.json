At physiological pH, each unmodified lysine contributes approximately $+1$ to the tail charge due to its protonated $\\varepsilon$-amino group. Acetylation neutralizes this positive charge, contributing $0$ at that site. You are told that, prior to any acetylation, the measured net charge of the tails is $Q_{0} = +36$ (this is the algebraic sum over all tail residues and does not necessarily equal $N$).

The charge values assigned to unmodified ($+1$) and acetylated ($0$) lysine are biochemically correct. The fact that $Q_{0} \\neq N$ is also realistic, as it correctly implies that residues other than the $N$ specified lysines contribute to the overall tail charge. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It specifies a probabilistic model (uniform and independent acetylation) and asks for the expected value of a system property (net charge). This is a standard problem in statistical mechanics and probability theory, which guarantees a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. All terms are clearly defined.\n\nThe problem exhibits none of the flaws listed in the validation checklist. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or ill-posed. It is a valid scientific problem.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe net charge of the histone tails, $Q$, can be expressed as the sum of the initial charge $Q_{0}$ and the total change in charge, $\\Delta Q$, resulting from acetylation.\n$$Q = Q_{0} + \\Delta Q$$\nAccording to the problem's explicit instruction, the change in charge contribution from a single lysine site upon acetylation is from $+1$ to $0$, which is a net change of $-1$. Let $K$ be the random variable representing the total number of lysine residues that are acetylated out of the $N$ available sites. Since each acetylation event reduces the total charge by $1$, the total change in charge is:\n$$\\Delta Q = K \\times (-1) = -K$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $Q$ gives:\n$$Q = Q_{0} - K$$\nWe are asked to find the expected net tail charge, $\\mathbb{E}[Q]$. By the linearity of the expectation operator:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[Q] = \\mathbb{E}[Q_{0} - K] = \\mathbb{E}[Q_{0}] - \\mathbb{E}[K]$$\nSince $Q_{0}$ is a given constant value, its expected value is the value itself: $\\mathbb{E}[Q_{0}] = Q_{0}$.\n$$\\mathbb{E}[Q] = Q_{0} - \\mathbb{E}[K]$$\nThe next step is to determine $\\mathbb{E}[K]$, the expected number of acetylated lysines. The problem states that acetylation occurs uniformly and independently at each of the $N$ sites, with a fraction $f$ of them being acetylated in a steady-state population. This is equivalent to stating that the probability of any given lysine site being acetylated is $p = f$.\n\nLet us define $N$ independent Bernoulli random variables, $X_{i}$ for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, N$, where $X_{i} = 1$ if the $i$-th lysine is acetylated and $X_{i} = 0$ if it is not. The probability of success (acetylation) is $P(X_{i} = 1) = f$.\nThe total number of acetylated lysines is the sum of these random variables:\n$$K = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_{i}$$\nThe expected value of $K$ is, by linearity of expectation:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[K] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_{i}\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbb{E}[X_{i}]$$\nThe expected value of a single Bernoulli variable $X_{i}$ is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X_{i}] = 1 \\cdot P(X_{i} = 1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_{i} = 0) = 1 \\cdot f + 0 \\cdot (1-f) = f$$\nTherefore, the expected total number of acetylated lysines is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[K] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} f = N \\cdot f$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[Q]$ yields the desired general formula:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[Q] = Q_{0} - Nf$$\nThis expression gives the expected net charge as a function of the initial charge $Q_{0}$, the number of sites $N$, and the fraction acetylated $f$.\n\nFinally, we must evaluate this expression for the given values: $Q_{0} = 36$, $N = 44$, and $f = 0.30$.\n$$\\mathbb{E}[Q] = 36 - (44)(0.30)$$\nThe calculation is straightforward:\n$$(44)(0.30) = 13.2$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}[Q] = 36 - 13.2 = 22.8$$\nThe expected net charge of the histone tails under the specified conditions is $22.8$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{22.8}$$", "id": "2821692"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply altering chromatin's physical state, histone modifications serve as docking sites for 'reader' proteins that translate the code into downstream biological action.

Removing a favorable interaction destabilizes the complex, meaning the free energy of binding for the mutant becomes less negative (i.e., increases).

This implies that the probability of detecting a mark given its true absence is zero.\n$P(D_4 | \\neg T_4) \\approx 0$\n$P(D_{27} | \\neg T_{27}) \\approx 0$\n\nThe first step is to infer the true marginal probabilities, $P(T_4)$ and $P(T_{27})$, from the observed detection frequencies. The observed probability of detecting a mark, for example $P(D_4)$, is estimated from the data as $P(D_4) = \\frac{O_4}{N}$. Using the law of total probability:\n$$P(D_4) = P(D_4 | T_4) P(T_4) + P(D_4 | \\neg T_4) P(\\neg T_4)$$\nGiven that $P(D_4 | \\neg T_4) \\approx 0$, this relationship simplifies to:\n$$P(D_4) \\approx P(D_4 | T_4) P(T_4) = s_4 P(T_4)$$\nFrom this, we infer the true probability of H3K4me3 presence:\n$$P(T_4) = \\frac{P(D_4)}{s_4} = \\frac{O_4 / N}{s_4} = \\frac{3600 / 10000}{0.90} = \\frac{0.36}{0.90} = 0.40$$\nSimilarly, for H3K27me3:\n$$P(T_{27}) = \\frac{P(D_{27})}{s_{27}} = \\frac{O_{27} / N}{s_{27}} = \\frac{2800 / 10000}{0.80} = \\frac{0.28}{0.80} = 0.35$$\n\nThe second step is to compute the expected true co-occurrence probability under the null hypothesis ($H_0$) that the true biological presences of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 are independent.

Assuming the detection of one mark depends only on its own true state, this becomes $P(D_4 | T_4) P(D_{27} | T_{27}) = s_4 s_{27}$.\nDue to negligible false positives, any term involving detection of a truly absent mark is zero.
