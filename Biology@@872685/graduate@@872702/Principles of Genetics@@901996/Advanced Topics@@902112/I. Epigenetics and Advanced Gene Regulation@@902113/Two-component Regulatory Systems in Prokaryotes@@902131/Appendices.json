This implies that the concentration of phosphorylated SHK, $S_p(t)$, can be treated as being in a quasi-steady state determined by the current input level. The problem provides the expression for this quasi-steady fraction, which arises from balancing SHK autophosphorylation and autodephosphorylation, neglecting the consumption of $S_p$ by phosphotransfer.\n\nFor a given SHK autophosphorylation rate constant $k_a$, the quasi-steady state concentration of $S_p$ is:\n$$\nS_p = [\\text{SHK}]_{T} \\frac{k_a}{k_a + k_h}\n$$\n\nFirst, we consider the initial steady state of the system for $t < 0$, where the autophosphorylation rate is $k_{a0}$.

I will proceed with the analysis.\n\n**Analysis of the System and Data**\n\nFirst, we must identify the species corresponding to the upper and lower bands. The problem states that Phos-tag gels retard the mobility of phosphorylated species. This means a phosphorylated protein will migrate more slowly (appear higher up on the gel) than its unphosphorylated counterpart. Furthermore, the control experiment confirms this: treatment with alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme that removes phosphate groups, eliminates the upper band and leaves only the lower band. Therefore, the slower-migrating upper band is the phosphorylated response regulator (RR~P), and the faster-migrating lower band is the unphosphorylated response regulator (RR). The data provided track the percentage of RR~P remaining over time.\n\nThe experiment measures the autodephosphorylation of RR~P, which is a hydrolysis reaction:\n$$\n\\text{RR~P} \\rightarrow \\text{RR} + \\text{P}_{\\text{i}}\n$$\nSuch a unimolecular or pseudo-unimolecular decay process is typically modeled with first-order kinetics. The integrated rate law for a first-order reaction is:\n$$\n[\\text{RR~P}]_t = [\\text{RR~P}]_0 e^{-kt}\n$$\nwhere $[\\text{RR~P}]_t$ is the concentration at time $t$, $[\\text{RR~P}]_0$ is the initial concentration, and $k$ is the apparent first-order rate constant. The half-life ($t_{1/2}$), the time required for the concentration to decrease to $50\\%$ of its initial value, is given by:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}\n$$\nWe analyze the provided data for each condition to determine if they fit this model and to estimate the kinetic parameters.\n\n**Condition 1: $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}] = 0.1$ mM**\nThe fraction of RR~P remaining is $1.00$ at $t=0$, $0.93$ at $t=1$ min, $0.76$ at $t=4$ min, and $0.44$ at $t=12$ min. The half-life is the time at which the fraction remaining is $0.50$. This occurs between $t=4$ min and $t=12$ min. To estimate $t_{1/2}$, we can calculate the apparent rate constant $k$ from the data.\nFrom $t=12$ min, $0.44 = (1.00)e^{-k(12)}$.\n$$k = -\\frac{\\ln(0.44)}{12 \\text{ min}} \\approx \\frac{0.821}{12 \\text{ min}} \\approx 0.0684 \\text{ min}^{-1}$$\nThe corresponding half-life is:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k} \\approx \\frac{0.693}{0.0684 \\text{ min}^{-1}} \\approx 10.1 \\text{ min}$$\nThis is consistent with the data, as the level of RR~P is just below $50\\%$ at $t=12$ min. The estimate of \"approximately $10$ min\" is accurate.\n\n**Condition 2: $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}] = 1.0$ mM**\nThe data show that at $t=4$ min, the fraction of RR~P remaining is exactly $50\\%$ ($0.50$). By definition, the half-life is $t_{1/2} = 4$ min.

This matches the datum of $84\\%$.\nAt $t=12$ min, which is $3$ half-lives, the predicted fraction is $(1/2)^3 = 1/8 = 0.125$, or $12.5\\%$. This exactly matches the datum of $12.5\\%$.\nThe data perfectly fit a first-order decay with $t_{1/2} = 4$ min.\n\n**Condition 3: $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}] = 10$ mM**\nThe fraction of RR~P remaining is $0.63$ at $t=1$ min, $0.15$ at $t=4$ min, and $\\sim 0.004$ at $t=12$ min. Let us calculate the rate constant from the $t=1$ min point.\n$0.63 = (1.00)e^{-k(1)}$.\n$$k = -\\frac{\\ln(0.63)}{1 \\text{ min}} \\approx 0.462 \\text{ min}^{-1}$$\nThe corresponding half-life is:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k} \\approx \\frac{0.693}{0.462 \\text{ min}^{-1}} \\approx 1.5 \\text{ min}$$\nLet us check consistency with other points using $t_{1/2} = 1.5$ min.\nAt $t=4$ min, the predicted fraction is $e^{-k(4)} = e^{-0.462 \\times 4} = e^{-1.848} \\approx 0.157$, or $15.7\\%$. This is very close to the datum of $15\\%$.\nAt $t=12$ min, the predicted fraction is $e^{-k(12)} = e^{-0.462 \\times 12} = e^{-5.544} \\approx 0.0039$, or $0.39\\%$. This matches the datum of $\\sim 0.4\\%$.\nThe estimate of a half-life of \"approximately $1.5$ min\" is accurate.\n\n**Conclusion from Analysis**\n1. The upper band is the phosphorylated RR.\n2. The dephosphorylation of RR~P follows apparent first-order kinetics.\n3. The rate of dephosphorylation increases with increasing $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]$, meaning the half-life decreases.\n4. The estimated half-lives are approximately $10$ min at $0.1$ mM, $4$ min at $1.0$ mM, and $1.5$ min at $10$ mM $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]$.\nThis dependence of the reaction rate on $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]$ is consistent with the stated role of $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ in catalyzing the hydrolysis of the aspartyl phosphate.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The upper band is the phosphorylated RR, and its loss over time follows an apparent first-order decay that accelerates with increasing $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]$; the estimated half-lives are approximately $10$ min at $0.1$ mM, $4$ min at $1.0$ mM, and $1.5$ min at $10$ mM, consistent with $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ directly catalyzing the receiver-domain hydrolysis.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with all aspects of our rigorous analysis: the identity of the band, the kinetic order, the effect of $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]$, the calculated half-lives, and the biochemical interpretation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The lower band is the phosphorylated RR, and increasing $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]$ stabilizes the phosphorylated species; the estimated half-lives therefore increase from approximately $1.5$ min at $0.1$ mM to approximately $10$ min at $10$ mM.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, the lower band is the unphosphorylated RR, as established by the Phos-tag principle and the phosphatase control. Second, increasing $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]$ *destabilizes* the phosphorylated species (i.e., accelerates its decay), it does not stabilize it. Third, the half-lives *decrease* with increasing $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]$, not increase.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The doublet arises from $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$-dependent RR oligomerization rather than phosphorylation state; alkaline phosphatase treatment would not alter the band pattern.**\nThis statement is factually wrong. It contradicts the explicit information given in the problem. The observation that alkaline phosphatase treatment collapses the doublet to a single, faster-migrating band is definitive proof that the mobility shift is due to phosphorylation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The data indicate zero-order loss of phosphate independent of $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]$; therefore, half-lives cannot be defined and the observed differences among conditions are not kinetic in origin.**\nThis statement is a cascade of errors. The decay is clearly not linear with time, refuting a zero-order model; it is exponential, as shown by our first-order analysis. The reaction rate is strongly dependent on $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]$, as evidenced by the dramatically different decay profiles. Half-lives are well-defined for first-order reactions.

The time dependences $[\\mathrm{HK}\\sim\\mathrm{P}](t)$ and $[\\mathrm{HK}](t)$ reflect stimulus control when HK is present and functional; $[\\mathrm{AcP}](t)$ is set by central metabolism and is independent of the HK stimulus on short timescales.\n\nYou perform the following perturbations and measurements:\n\n- Wild type (WT): Upon turning the stimulus ON at $t=0$, $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}(t)$ rises from $0.10$ to $0.70$ with an observed rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{on}} \\approx 1.0~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$; upon turning the stimulus OFF at $t=10~\\mathrm{min}$, $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}(t)$ decays to $0.10$ with $k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\approx 0.8~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n\n- $\\Delta \\mathrm{hk}$: Deleting the HK eliminates stimulus-responsive changes in $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}(t)$; with the stimulus toggled, $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}(t)$ remains near $0.30$ without a measurable fast rise or fall. When the carbon source is switched at $t=0$ from glucose to acetate to increase acetyl phosphate, $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}(t)$ increases slowly from $0.30$ to $0.50$ with $k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{\\mathrm{AcP}} \\approx 0.05~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$ and, when switched back at $t=10~\\mathrm{min}$, decays with $k_{\\mathrm{hyd}} \\approx 0.03~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n\n- $\\Delta \\mathrm{pta}$: Deleting pta lowers basal $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$ to $0.05$. The stimulus still elicits a rise and fall with $k_{\\mathrm{on}} \\approx 1.0~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\approx 0.8~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, returning to the low baseline.\n\n- $\\Delta \\mathrm{ackA}$: Deleting ackA elevates basal $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$ to $0.40$. The stimulus still induces a fast rise to $0.75$ and, upon stimulus OFF, a fast decay with $k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\approx 0.8~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$ back to the elevated baseline.\n\n- Kinase-dead, phosphatase-competent HK: Expressing an HK variant with a catalytic histidine-to-glutamine substitution in the H-box that abolishes autophosphorylation but retains phosphatase activity reduces $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}(t)$ from $0.30$ to $0.10$ with $k_{\\mathrm{deP}} \\approx 0.6~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$ when introduced into the $\\Delta \\mathrm{hk}$ background under high acetyl phosphate conditions; the stimulus does not increase $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}(t)$ in this strain.\n\nWhich option best describes a minimal, logically sufficient experimental strategy and kinetic signature to distinguish in vivo RR phosphorylation by HK from small-molecule phosphodonors and to conclude that HK-driven phosphotransfer dominates under the stimulus? Choose the single best option.\n\nA. Demonstrate that the fast, stimulus-coupled rise and fall of $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}(t)$ in strains with an intact HK are abolished in $\\Delta \\mathrm{hk}$, where only slow, stimulus-independent changes persist that track acetyl phosphate manipulations and decay with $k_{\\mathrm{hyd}} \\ll k_{\\mathrm{off}}$. Show that lowering acetyl phosphate with $\\Delta \\mathrm{pta}$ reduces basal $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$ but leaves the fast stimulus-coupled kinetics unchanged, whereas elevating acetyl phosphate with $\\Delta \\mathrm{ackA}$ raises basal $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$ without altering fast on/off rates. Finally, rescue fast dephosphorylation in the $\\Delta \\mathrm{hk}$ background by expressing a kinase-dead, phosphatase-competent HK to accelerate RR~P decay with $k_{\\mathrm{deP}} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$ even under high acetyl phosphate, establishing that the HK accounts for the rapid stimulus-coupled kinetics.\n\nB. Delete ackA to deplete acetyl phosphate and show that loss of the stimulus response in $\\Delta \\mathrm{ackA}$ indicates small-molecule dominance. Conclude that any residual response in WT must therefore be driven entirely by acetyl phosphate, since ackA controls acetyl phosphate production.\n\nC. Compare only steady-state $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$ levels at $t=20~\\mathrm{min}$ across WT and $\\Delta \\mathrm{hk}$ with the stimulus ON; if WT is higher than $\\Delta \\mathrm{hk}$ by at least $0.20$, infer that HK is the dominant kinase, since higher steady-state implies enzymatic input.\n\nD. Replace RR with an aspartate-to-glutamate mutant (phosphomimetic) and, if this mutant shows slower dynamics than WT, attribute the slow component to acetyl phosphate and the fast component to HK; no genetic perturbation of acetyl phosphate metabolism or HK is necessary.\n\nE. Add a general histidine kinase inhibitor at $t=0$ and infer that any remaining phosphorylation must be due to acetyl phosphate; if the decay half-life of RR~P after inhibitor addition is longer than $10~\\mathrm{min}$, conclude small-molecule dominance without needing genetic controls.", "solution": "The validity of the problem statement must first be established.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n-   **System:** A two-component regulatory system in a bacterium consisting of a histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR).\n-   **RR Phosphorylation Sources:**\n    1.  HK-mediated phosphotransfer from autophosphorylated HK (HK~P). This process is stimulus-dependent.\n    2.  Nonenzymatic phosphorylation by small-molecule phosphodonors like acetyl phosphate (AcP). This process is stimulus-independent.\n-   **HK Activities:** HK autophosphorylates on a histidine residue using ATP in a stimulus-dependent manner. It also often possesses a phosphatase activity that catalyzes RR dephosphorylation.\n-   **AcP Metabolism:** Produced by phosphate acetyltransferase (Pta, encoded by `pta`). Consumed by acetate kinase (AckA, encoded by `ackA`). Deleting `pta` (`Δpta`) depletes AcP. Deleting `ackA` (`ΔackA`) increases the AcP pool.\n-   **Measurement:** The fraction of phosphorylated RR, denoted as $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}(t)$, is measured over time $t$ using Phos-tag SDS-PAGE.\n-   **Stimulus Protocol:** A stimulus is turned ON at $t=0$ and OFF at $t=10~\\mathrm{min}$.\n-   **Kinetic Model:** The rate of change of the phosphorylated RR fraction is given by:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}}{dt}\n    = k_{\\mathrm{HK}}\\,[\\mathrm{HK{\\sim}P}](t)\\,\\big(1-f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}\\big)\n    + k_{\\mathrm{AcP}}\\,[\\mathrm{AcP}](t)\\,\\big(1-f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}\\big)\n    - k_{\\mathrm{phos}}\\, [\\mathrm{HK}](t)\\, f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}\n    - k_{\\mathrm{hyd}}\\, f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}.\n    $$\n    Here, $k_{\\mathrm{HK}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{AcP}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{phos}}$, and $k_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$ are rate constants. The concentrations $[\\mathrm{HK{\\sim}P}](t)$ and $[\\mathrm{HK}](t)$ are stimulus-dependent, while $[\\mathrm{AcP}](t)$ is not on short timescales.\n\n-   **Experimental Observations:**\n    -   **Wild type (WT):** Stimulus ON: $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$ rises from $0.10$ to $0.70$ with $k_{\\mathrm{on}} \\approx 1.0~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. Stimulus OFF: $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$ decays to $0.10$ with $k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\approx 0.8~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n    -   **$\\Delta \\mathrm{hk}$:** $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}(t)$ is constant at $\\approx 0.30$ despite stimulus. Switching carbon source to increase AcP causes a slow rise from $0.30$ to $0.50$ with $k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{\\mathrm{AcP}} \\approx 0.05~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. Switching back causes decay with $k_{\\mathrm{hyd}} \\approx 0.03~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n    -   **$\\Delta \\mathrm{pta}$:** Basal $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$ is $0.05$. Stimulus response rates are unaffected: $k_{\\mathrm{on}} \\approx 1.0~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, $k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\approx 0.8~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n    -   **$\\Delta \\mathrm{ackA}$:** Basal $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$ is $0.40$. Stimulus response rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\approx 0.8~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$ is unaffected.\n    -   **Kinase-dead, phosphatase-competent HK in $\\Delta \\mathrm{hk}$:** Expressing this HK variant in a `Δhk` strain under high AcP conditions reduces $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}(t)$ from $0.30$ to $0.10$ with a rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{deP}} \\approx 0.6~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, describing a standard biological system (two-component signaling) with established molecular players (HK, RR, AcP) and genetic tools (`Δpta`, `ΔackA`). The kinetic model is a correct and standard representation of the underlying biochemical reactions. The experimental data are internally consistent and plausible. For example, the decay rate of RR~P in the absence of HK ($k_{\\mathrm{hyd}} \\approx 0.03~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$) is much slower than in its presence ($k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\approx 0.8~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$), consistent with the HK having a dominant phosphatase activity. The problem is well-posed, asking for the best experimental strategy among choices, and is free of ambiguity or contradiction. It is a substantive problem in biochemical kinetics and genetics, not trivial or tautological.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central question is to devise a set of experiments that can unambiguously distinguish between phosphorylation of the response regulator (RR) by its cognate histidine kinase (HK) and by a small-molecule phosphodonor, acetyl phosphate (AcP), and to show that the HK pathway is dominant during a stimulus response.\n\nA logically sufficient strategy must achieve the following:\n1.  **Demonstrate Necessity:** Show that the HK is required for the fast, stimulus-dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. This is best achieved by deleting the gene for the HK and observing the loss of the rapid response.\n2.  **Isolate and Characterize the Alternative Pathway:** In the absence of the HK, demonstrate the existence of the alternative pathway (AcP-dependent phosphorylation) and characterize its kinetics. This pathway should be stimulus-independent but responsive to metabolic perturbations that alter the AcP pool.\n3.  **Compare Kinetic Signatures:** Directly compare the rate constants of the HK-dependent processes with those of the AcP-dependent processes. To show HK dominance, the HK-associated rates must be significantly faster.\n4.  **Decouple Pathways:** Show that the fast, HK-driven kinetics are independent of the AcP pool size, while the basal, steady-state level of RR phosphorylation is dependent on it. This can be done by genetically manipulating the AcP pool.\n5.  **Dissect HK Activities:** Because the HK is bifunctional (both a kinase and a phosphatase), it is crucial to show that it is responsible for both the rapid 'ON' and 'OFF' kinetics. Specifically, one must demonstrate its potent phosphatase activity, which is responsible for the rapid signal termination.\n\nLet us analyze the provided options based on this logical framework.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Demonstrate that the fast, stimulus-coupled rise and fall of $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}(t)$ in strains with an intact HK are abolished in $\\Delta \\mathrm{hk}$, where only slow, stimulus-independent changes persist that track acetyl phosphate manipulations and decay with $k_{\\mathrm{hyd}} \\ll k_{\\mathrm{off}}$. Show that lowering acetyl phosphate with $\\Delta \\mathrm{pta}$ reduces basal $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$ but leaves the fast stimulus-coupled kinetics unchanged, whereas elevating acetyl phosphate with $\\Delta \\mathrm{ackA}$ raises basal $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$ without altering fast on/off rates. Finally, rescue fast dephosphorylation in the $\\Delta \\mathrm{hk}$ background by expressing a kinase-dead, phosphatase-competent HK to accelerate RR~P decay with $k_{\\mathrm{deP}} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$ even under high acetyl phosphate, establishing that the HK accounts for the rapid stimulus-coupled kinetics.**\n\nThis option proposes a comprehensive strategy that aligns perfectly with the required logical steps.\n-   It uses the `Δhk` strain to prove the necessity of the HK for the fast, stimulus-driven response.\n-   It uses the `Δhk` strain combined with metabolic shifts to characterize the slow, AcP-dependent pathway, explicitly noting the key kinetic comparison: the intrinsic hydrolysis rate ($k_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$ from the `Δhk` experiment, $\\approx 0.03~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$) is much smaller than the observed OFF-rate in WT ($k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\approx 0.8~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$).\n-   It uses `Δpta` and `ΔackA` mutants to demonstrate that the fast kinetics are independent of the AcP pool, while the basal phosphorylation level is not. This successfully decouples the two pathways.\n-   It uses a kinase-dead, phosphatase-competent HK mutant to isolate and demonstrate the strong phosphatase activity of the HK. The measured rate ($k_{\\mathrm{deP}} \\approx 0.6~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$) is much greater than hydrolysis ($k_{\\mathrm{hyd}} \\approx 0.03~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$) and accounts for the majority of the fast $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ observed in WT.\nThis sequence of experiments and observations provides a complete and logically sound basis for the conclusion.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Delete ackA to deplete acetyl phosphate and show that loss of the stimulus response in $\\Delta \\mathrm{ackA}$ indicates small-molecule dominance. Conclude that any residual response in WT must therefore be driven entirely by acetyl phosphate, since ackA controls acetyl phosphate production.**\n\nThis option is flawed on multiple grounds. First, it makes a factual error: the problem states that deleting `ackA` *increases* the acetyl phosphate pool, not depletes it. Second, the logic is unsound. Even if deleting `ackA` did deplete AcP, a loss of stimulus response would implicate the HK, not AcP, since the HK is responsible for the stimulus response. Third, the premise contradicts the provided data, which states that in the `ΔackA` strain, the stimulus still induces a fast response. The entire option is based on incorrect premises and flawed reasoning.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Compare only steady-state $f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$ levels at $t=20~\\mathrm{min}$ across WT and $\\Delta \\mathrm{hk}$ with the stimulus ON; if WT is higher than $\\Delta \\mathrm{hk}$ by at least $0.20$, infer that HK is the dominant kinase, since higher steady-state implies enzymatic input.**\n\nThis strategy is insufficient. While a higher steady-state level of phosphorylation in WT ($f_{\\mathrm{RRP}} \\approx 0.70$) compared to `Δhk` ($f_{\\mathrm{RRP}} \\approx 0.30$) does indicate a significant contribution from the HK, it provides no information about kinetics. Dominance in a dynamic signaling system is fundamentally about the *rates* of signal propagation and termination. A slow but persistent kinase with a weak phosphatase antagonist could also lead to a high steady state. This approach completely ignores the crucial kinetic data ($k_{\\mathrm{on}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$) that demonstrates the *speed* of the HK-driven response, which is central to the problem. Relying only on steady-state levels is an incomplete analysis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Replace RR with an aspartate-to-glutamate mutant (phosphomimetic) and, if this mutant shows slower dynamics than WT, attribute the slow component to acetyl phosphate and the fast component to HK; no genetic perturbation of acetyl phosphate metabolism or HK is necessary.**\n\nThis experimental design is nonsensical for this problem. An aspartate-to-glutamate (D-to-E) mutant is a \"phosphomimetic\". It is designed to mimic the structure and function of the phosphorylated protein, but it cannot itself be phosphorylated or dephosphorylated at that site. Therefore, its \"phosphorylation dynamics\" ($f_{\\mathrm{RRP}}$) cannot be measured because it does not undergo this covalent modification. The experiment is fundamentally ill-conceived for studying phosphorylation kinetics.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Add a general histidine kinase inhibitor at $t=0$ and infer that any remaining phosphorylation must be due to acetyl phosphate; if the decay half-life of RR~P after inhibitor addition is longer than $10~\\mathrm{min}$, conclude small-molecule dominance without needing genetic controls.**\n\nThis pharmacological approach is ambiguous and insufficient. A \"general histidine kinase inhibitor,\" especially an ATP competitor, could inhibit both the kinase and the phosphatase activities of the bifunctional HK. If the inhibitor blocks the HK's powerful phosphatase activity, the only path for dephosphorylation would be the slow intrinsic hydrolysis ($k_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$). Observing a long half-life (e.g., $t_{1/2} > 10~\\mathrm{min}$ implies a rate constant $k < \\ln(2)/10 \\approx 0.07~\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$) would only prove that the combined decay processes are slow in the presence of the inhibitor. It would fail to demonstrate that the HK itself is a potent phosphatase, which is the reason for the rapid $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ in the uninhibited WT strain. This experiment cannot properly dissect the bifunctional nature of the HK, a task for which the genetic approach described in Option A is far superior and more definitive.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption A describes a rigorous and comprehensive set of experiments that systematically dissects the contributions of both the HK-dependent and AcP-dependent pathways to RR phosphorylation. It correctly uses genetic perturbations and analysis of kinetic parameters to establish the dominance of the fast, HK-driven pathway during stimulus response. It is the only option that is both logically sufficient and consistent with the provided data.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2863665"}]}
