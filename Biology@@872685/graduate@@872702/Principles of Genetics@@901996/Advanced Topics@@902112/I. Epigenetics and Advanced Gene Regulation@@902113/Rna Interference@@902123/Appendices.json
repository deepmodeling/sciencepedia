This exercise explores the critical concept of pathway saturation, a common challenge in RNAi-based therapeutics where high expression of a synthetic short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) can overwhelm shared cellular machinery. By applying a quantitative bottleneck model, you will calculate how competition for key factors like Exportin-5 and Argonaute-2 can lead to the global dysregulation of endogenous miRNA processing and function. [@problem_id:2848089]", "problem": "A human cell uses canonical microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis: primary miRNA transcripts are cleaved by Drosha/DGCR8 in the nucleus to precursor hairpins, which are exported by Exportin-5 (XPO5) in complex with Ran-guanosine triphosphate (Ran-GTP) to the cytoplasm, where Dicer (a Ribonuclease III enzyme) produces miRNA duplexes that load into Argonaute-2 (AGO2) to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Small hairpin RNA (shRNA) transcripts produced from an expression vector fold into hairpins that enter this same pathway at the precursor hairpin stage and therefore share Exportin-5 and Argonaute with endogenous miRNAs. Consider a cell in which endogenous precursor miRNAs are produced at a rate $r_m$ and an shRNA vector produces hairpins at a rate $r_s$. Assume the following minimal, capacity-limited, competition model, justified by mass-action and steady-state queueing of identical-class substrates:\n\n- Exportin-5-mediated nuclear export is capacity-limited with a maximum throughput $V_E$ (molecules per minute). When $r_m + r_s \\le V_E$, export is unsaturated and all produced hairpins are exported. When $r_m + r_s > V_E$, export is saturated and the total export flux equals $V_E$, partitioned between miRNA and shRNA in proportion to their input production rates, so that the miRNA export flux is $J_{E,m} = V_E \\cdot \\dfrac{r_m}{r_m + r_s}$ and the shRNA export flux is $J_{E,s} = V_E \\cdot \\dfrac{r_s}{r_m + r_s}$.\n- Downstream of Dicer (assume Dicer is not rate-limiting), AGO2 loading is capacity-limited with maximum throughput $V_A$ (molecules per minute). Let the incoming duplex influxes to AGO2 be the exported fluxes $J_{E,m}$ and $J_{E,s}$. When $J_{E,m} + J_{E,s} \\le V_A$, AGO2 is unsaturated and all exported duplexes are loaded. When $J_{E,m} + J_{E,s} > V_A$, AGO2 is saturated and the total AGO2 loading flux equals $V_A$, partitioned in proportion to the incoming duplex fluxes, so that the miRNA AGO2 loading flux is $J_{A,m} = V_A \\cdot \\dfrac{J_{E,m}}{J_{E,m} + J_{E,s}}$ and the shRNA AGO2 loading flux is $J_{A,s} = V_A \\cdot \\dfrac{J_{E,s}}{J_{E,m} + J_{E,s}}$.\n\nAssume endogenous precursor miRNAs are produced at $r_m = 1000$ molecules per minute, Exportin-5 has $V_E = 2000$ molecules per minute, and AGO2 has $V_A = 1500$ molecules per minute.

A quantitative solution can be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds in two parts. First, the baseline state under strong shRNA expression is characterized. Second, each proposed manipulation is evaluated against the stated goals.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of the Baseline Saturated State**\n\nThe initial state is defined by the parameters:\n$r_m = 1000$ molecules/min\n$r_s = 6000$ molecules/min\n$V_E = 2000$ molecules/min\n$V_A = 1500$ molecules/min\n\n1.  **Assess Exportin-5 (XPO5) Saturation**:\n    The total production rate of hairpins is $r_{total} = r_m + r_s = 1000 + 6000 = 7000$ molecules/min.\n    We compare this to the maximum export capacity $V_E = 2000$ molecules/min.\n    Since $r_{total} = 7000 > V_E = 2000$, the nuclear export step mediated by Exportin-5 is **saturated**.\n\n2.  **Calculate Export Fluxes ($J_E$)**:\n    Because the export step is saturated, the total export flux is limited to $V_E$. The fluxes for endogenous miRNA ($J_{E,m}$) and shRNA ($J_{E,s}$) are partitioned proportionally to their production rates:\n    $J_{E,m} = V_E \\cdot \\dfrac{r_m}{r_m + r_s} = 2000 \\cdot \\dfrac{1000}{1000 + 6000} = 2000 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{7} = \\dfrac{2000}{7} \\approx 285.7$ molecules/min.\n    $J_{E,s} = V_E \\cdot \\dfrac{r_s}{r_m + r_s} = 2000 \\cdot \\dfrac{6000}{1000 + 6000} = 2000 \\cdot \\dfrac{6}{7} = \\dfrac{12000}{7} \\approx 1714.3$ molecules/min.\n    The sum of these fluxes is $J_{E,m} + J_{E,s} = \\frac{2000}{7} + \\frac{12000}{7} = \\frac{14000}{7} = 2000 = V_E$.\n\n3.  **Assess Argonaute-2 (AGO2) Saturation**:\n    The total influx to AGO2 is the total export flux from the nucleus, which is $J_{E,m} + J_{E,s} = 2000$ molecules/min.\n    We compare this to the maximum AGO2 loading capacity $V_A = 1500$ molecules/min.\n    Since the influx $2000 > V_A = 1500$, the AGO2 loading step is also **saturated**.\n\n4.  **Calculate AGO2 Loading Fluxes ($J_A$)**:\n    Because AGO2 loading is saturated, the total loading flux is limited to $V_A$. The fluxes for miRNA ($J_{A,m}$) and shRNA ($J_{A,s}$) are partitioned proportionally to their incoming fluxes from the export step:\n    $J_{A,m} = V_A \\cdot \\dfrac{J_{E,m}}{J_{E,m} + J_{E,s}} = 1500 \\cdot \\dfrac{2000/7}{2000} = 1500 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{7} = \\dfrac{1500}{7} \\approx 214.3$ molecules/min.\n    $J_{A,s} = V_A \\cdot \\dfrac{J_{E,s}}{J_{E,m} + J_{E,s}} = 1500 \\cdot \\dfrac{12000/7}{2000} = 1500 \\cdot \\dfrac{6}{7} = \\dfrac{9000}{7} \\approx 1285.7$ molecules/min.\n    The sum is $J_{A,m} + J_{A,s} = \\frac{1500}{7} + \\frac{9000}{7} = \\frac{10500}{7} = 1500 = V_A$.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 1**: Under strong shRNA expression, both the Exportin-5 and Argonaute-2 steps are saturated. The endogenous miRNA AGO2 loading flux is $J_{A,m} = \\frac{1500}{7} \\approx 214.3$ molecules/min. This represents a severe reduction from the uninhibited potential flux of $1000$ molecules/min (since for $r_s=0$, $r_m=1000 < V_E$ and $r_m=1000 < V_A$, so all would be processed). This reduction is the mechanistic basis of global miRNA dysregulation: excessive shRNA expression saturates shared pathway components, causing endogenous miRNAs to be outcompeted, leading to their reduced processing and function.\n\n**Part 2: Evaluation of Proposed Manipulations**\n\nThe goal is to find the single manipulation that \"most selectively restores endogenous miRNA target repression without reducing shRNA potency.\" This translates to maximizing the increase in $J_{A,m}$ while ensuring $J_{A,s}$ does not decrease from its baseline value of $\\approx 1285.7$.\n\n**A. Overexpress Exportin-5 to increase $V_E$ to $4000$ molecules per minute.**\n- Parameters: $r_m=1000, r_s=6000, V_E=4000, V_A=1500$.\n- XPO5 saturation: $r_m+r_s = 7000 > V_E=4000$. Saturated.\n- Export fluxes: $J_{E,m} = 4000 \\cdot \\frac{1}{7}$, $J_{E,s} = 4000 \\cdot \\frac{6}{7}$. Total flux = $4000$.\n- AGO2 saturation: Influx of $4000 > V_A=1500$. Saturated.\n- AGO2 fluxes: $J_{A,m} = V_A \\cdot \\frac{J_{E,m}}{J_{E,m}+J_{E,s}} = 1500 \\cdot \\frac{4000/7}{4000} = \\frac{1500}{7} \\approx 214.3$. $J_{A,s} = 1500 \\cdot \\frac{6}{7} = \\frac{9000}{7} \\approx 1285.7$.\n- Analysis: A useful simplification when both steps are saturated ($r_m+r_s > V_E$ and $V_E > V_A$) is $J_{A,m} = V_A \\cdot \\frac{r_m}{r_m+r_s}$. Increasing an intermediate bottleneck capacity ($V_E$) without changing the final bottleneck capacity ($V_A$) or the input ratio has no effect on the final output fluxes. The fluxes $J_{A,m}$ and $J_{A,s}$ are unchanged.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**. This manipulation is ineffective.\n\n**B. Overexpress Argonaute-2 to increase $V_A$ to $3000$ molecules per minute.**\n- Parameters: $r_m=1000, r_s=6000, V_E=2000, V_A=3000$.\n- XPO5 saturation: $r_m+r_s = 7000 > V_E=2000$. Saturated.\n- Export fluxes: $J_{E,m} = 2000 \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{2000}{7}$, $J_{E,s} = 2000 \\cdot \\frac{6}{7} = \\frac{12000}{7}$. Total flux = $2000$.\n- AGO2 saturation: Influx of $2000 \\le V_A=3000$. **Unsaturated**.\n- AGO2 fluxes: Since AGO2 is unsaturated, $J_{A,m} = J_{E,m} = \\frac{2000}{7} \\approx 285.7$. $J_{A,s} = J_{E,s} = \\frac{12000}{7} \\approx 1714.3$.\n- Analysis: This manipulation relieves the AGO2 bottleneck. The new system-limiting step is XPO5 export. As a result, $J_{A,m}$ increases from $\\approx 214.3$ to $\\approx 285.7$, and $J_{A,s}$ increases from $\\approx 1285.7$ to $\\approx 1714.3$. This meets both criteria.\n- Verdict: Candidate for best option.\n\n**C. Reduce shRNA transcription to $r_s = 2000$ molecules per minute.**\n- Parameters: $r_m=1000, r_s=2000, V_E=2000, V_A=1500$.\n- XPO5 saturation: $r_m+r_s = 3000 > V_E=2000$. Saturated.\n- Export fluxes: $J_{E,m} = 2000 \\cdot \\frac{1000}{3000} = \\frac{2000}{3}$. $J_{E,s} = 2000 \\cdot \\frac{2000}{3000} = \\frac{4000}{3}$. Total flux = $2000$.\n- AGO2 saturation: Influx of $2000 > V_A=1500$. Saturated.\n- AGO2 fluxes: $J_{A,m} = 1500 \\cdot \\frac{J_{E,m}}{J_{E,m}+J_{E,s}} = 1500 \\cdot \\frac{2000/3}{2000} = \\frac{1500}{3} = 500$. $J_{A,s} = 1500 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = 1000$.\n- Analysis: This manipulation restores $J_{A,m}$ significantly (from $\\approx 214.3$ to $500$). However, it reduces shRNA flux $J_{A,s}$ from $\\approx 1285.7$ to $1000$.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**. This fails the condition of not reducing shRNA potency.\n\n**D. Overexpress both Exportin-5 to $V_E = 4000$ and Argonaute-2 to $V_A = 3000$.**\n- Parameters: $r_m=1000, r_s=6000, V_E=4000, V_A=3000$.\n- XPO5 saturation: $r_m+r_s = 7000 > V_E=4000$. Saturated.\n- Export fluxes: $J_{E,m} = 4000 \\cdot \\frac{1}{7}$, $J_{E,s} = 4000 \\cdot \\frac{6}{7}$. Total flux = $4000$.\n- AGO2 saturation: Influx of $4000 > V_A=3000$. Saturated.\n- AGO2 fluxes: Using the simplified formula $J_{A,m} = V_A \\cdot \\frac{r_m}{r_m+r_s}$ for the double-saturated case:\n    $J_{A,m} = 3000 \\cdot \\frac{1000}{7000} = \\frac{3000}{7} \\approx 428.6$.\n    $J_{A,s} = 3000 \\cdot \\frac{6000}{7000} = \\frac{18000}{7} \\approx 2571.4$.\n- Analysis: This manipulation increases $J_{A,m}$ from $\\approx 214.3$ to $\\approx 428.6$ and increases $J_{A,s}$ from $\\approx 1285.7$ to $\\approx 2571.4$. This meets both criteria.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Comparison of B and D**\n\nBoth options B and D satisfy the condition of restoring endogenous miRNA function without reducing shRNA potency. The question asks for the \"single best\" option that \"most selectively restores\" this function.\n- Option B (increase $V_A$ only): $J_{A,m}$ increases to $\\approx 285.7$.\n- Option D (increase both $V_E$ and $V_A$): $J_{A,m}$ increases to $\\approx 428.6$.\n\nOption D results in a substantially greater restoration of the endogenous miRNA flux ($J_{A,m}$) than Option B. The term \"selectively\" in this context cannot mean changing the miRNA:shRNA flux ratio, as both B and D maintain the original partitioning ratio determined by production rates ($r_m:r_s$). Therefore, \"most selectively\" must be interpreted as \"most effectively\" or \"to the greatest degree.\" Option D provides the greatest rescue of $J_{A,m}$ while also enhancing $J_{A,s}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2848089"}, {"introduction": "Having examined the upstream biogenesis pathway, we now zoom in on the catalytic heart of RNA interference: the 'Slicer' activity of the Argonaute-2 ($AGO2$) protein.

The roles of siRNA, AGO$2$, RISC, the guide strand, seed region, and the PIWI domain's slicer activity are all fundamental, experimentally verified concepts. The requirement of $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ for catalysis and the general architecture of guide-target pairing are factually correct.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed.

The provided information is sufficient to deduce a unique and logical answer.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is precise, technical, and free of ambiguity or subjective interpretation.

It provides all necessary details regarding the structure of the enzyme-substrate complex.\n- **Realism**: The described scenario is a standard experimental setup used to probe the mechanism of AGO$2$ slicer activity. Such guide-target constructs are routinely used in research.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated question about a core biochemical mechanism. I will proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\nThe fundamental process in question is the endonucleolytic cleavage of a target RNA, a process termed \"slicing,\" executed by the Argonaute $2$ (AGO$2$) protein. AGO$2$ is an RNase, and its catalytic activity resides within its PIWI domain. The PIWI domain possesses an RNase H-like fold, which utilizes a catalytic motif of acidic residues (typically a D-E-D-H or D-D-H tetrad) to coordinate two divalent metal cations, specified here as $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$.\n\nEnzyme catalysis is critically dependent on the precise three-dimensional arrangement of the substrate within the active site. For AGO$2$, the substrate is the guide-RNA:target-RNA duplex. The enzyme's structure dictates that for cleavage to occur, the duplex must adopt a conformation that positions a specific phosphodiester bond of the target strand—the scissile phosphate—correctly relative to the catalytic $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ ions. This correct positioning allows for a water molecule, activated by the metal ions, to perform a nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom, leading to the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond.\n\nStructural and biochemical studies have unequivocally established that the canonical scissile phosphate is the one located between the target nucleotides that are base-paired opposite guide nucleotides $10$ and $11$. This means that the region of the guide-target duplex spanning positions $10$ and $11$ must form a continuous A-form RNA helix. This specific geometry is an absolute prerequisite for catalysis. Any significant distortion in this central region will misalign the scissile phosphate with respect to the catalytic machinery of the PIWI domain.\n\nIn the present problem, there are two consecutive mismatches precisely at positions $10$ and $11$. These mismatches break the continuity of the Watson-Crick base pairing in the exact location required for catalysis. The presence of non-canonical or non-existent base pairs at this critical juncture will introduce a significant distortion or \"kink\" in the RNA duplex. This distortion prevents the phosphodiester bond between the target nucleotides opposite guide positions $10$ and $11$ from entering the active site with the correct orientation. As a result, the distance and angle between the scissile phosphate and the coordinated $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ ions will be non-ideal, and catalysis will be impossible. The entire catalytic reaction is thus aborted. The perfect pairing in the seed region ($2$–$8$) ensures initial recognition and stable binding of the target RNA, but it cannot force the catalytically incompetent central region into a productive conformation. Similarly, the supplementary pairing at positions $13$–$16$ adds to the overall binding affinity but is spatially distinct from the active site and cannot rectify the geometric defect at the cleavage site.\n\nTherefore, endonucleolytic cleavage will be abolished.\n\nEvaluation of the options:\n\nA. Efficient cleavage at the canonical site occurs because seed pairing at positions $2$–$8$ is sufficient to dock the target and present the scissile phosphate to the active site.\nThis statement is flawed. While seed pairing is sufficient for target recognition and stable docking, it is insufficient for catalysis. Slicer activity requires extensive and correct pairing across the central region of the guide to position the scissile phosphate. The premise that seed pairing alone enables cleavage is fundamentally incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nB. Cleavage is abolished because mismatches at positions $10$–$11$ disrupt the central duplex segment that positions the scissile phosphate between nucleotides opposite guide $10$ and $11$, preventing proper coordination by the PIWI active site and $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$.\nThis option accurately describes the mechanism. The mismatches are at the critical catalytic center. They cause a structural distortion of the duplex. This distortion prevents the scissile phosphate from achieving the required geometry within the PIWI active site for $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$-mediated hydrolysis. Consequently, cleavage is abolished. This aligns perfectly with first principles of enzyme catalysis and the known structure of AGO$2$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. Cleavage still occurs but is shifted by $+1$ to $+2$ nucleotides downstream, because Argonaute relocates the active site to the nearest continuous pairing block.\nThis assertion is mechanistically unsound. The PIWI active site is a fixed structural feature of the AGO$2$ protein. The protein does not \"relocate\" its active site. The substrate must conform to the enzyme's fixed architecture. The cleavage site is determined by a precise molecular ruler mechanism, counting from the $5'$-end of the guide. The pairing block at positions $13$–$16$ is too far from the catalytic center to be utilized for cleavage. Shifting of cleavage is not a general compensatory mechanism for central mismatches of this nature.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Cleavage occurs with reduced rate because $3^{\\prime}$ supplementary pairing at positions $13$–$16$ compensates for the central mismatches and restores the scissile phosphate geometry after a longer dwell time.\nThis option misunderstands the distinction between binding affinity and catalytic competence. Supplementary pairing at the $3^{\\prime}$ end can increase the overall stability of the guide-target interaction, potentially increasing the complex's lifetime (dwell time). However, this thermodynamic stabilization cannot correct a fatal geometric flaw at the active site. The requirement for a specific A-form helical geometry at positions $10$ and $11$ is absolute. A longer dwell time does not allow a geometrically forbidden conformation to become catalytically active. Cleavage is not merely reduced; it is prevented.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2848091"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice expands the view again to the systems level, exploring competitive interactions among RNAs at the target level.

A single miRNA family at total abundance $M_T=6000$ molecules per cell targets three native mRNAs with identical seed-site affinity, $K_d=5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, and independent, noncooperative sites. Native mRNA abundances and site counts are: target $T_1$ at $1000$ molecules per cell with $2$ seed sites per transcript, target $T_2$ at $500$ molecules per cell with $1$ seed site per transcript, and target $T_3$ at $200$ molecules per cell with $3$ seed sites per transcript. A sponge ceRNA $S$ is introduced at $2000$ molecules per cell carrying $10$ seed sites per transcript (same $K_d$ and site independence). Assume steady state, equal access of miRNA–RISC to all sites, and that binding equilibrates rapidly relative to mRNA turnover so that binding equilibrium determines site occupancy. Which option best predicts how introducing the sponge perturbs repression of native targets, including the approximate quantitative change in free miRNA–RISC and per-site occupancy, and the resulting directional change in repression across $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_3$?\n\nA. The sponge sequesters a large fraction of miRNA–RISC, reducing the free pool from approximately $4.6\\times 10^3$ to approximately $1.5\\times 10^3$ molecules; the per-site occupancy drops from about $0.44$ to about $0.20$ (a $\\sim 55\\%$ decrease), so repression strength on all native targets decreases proportionally (roughly a $\\sim 2.2$-fold reduction in occupied sites per transcript), independent of site number except for the trivial scaling with each transcript’s site count.\n\nB. The sponge’s multivalency drives cooperative binding that increases miRNA–RISC occupancy on native targets; per-site occupancy rises above $0.44$, strengthening repression of $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_3$.\n\nC. The sponge has negligible impact: free miRNA–RISC decreases only slightly (from $6.0\\times 10^3$ to about $5.5\\times 10^3$ molecules), leaving per-site occupancy and repression essentially unchanged (within $\\sim 5\\%$).\n\nD. The sponge redistributes miRNA–RISC to the highest-site target $T_3$, which becomes more repressed, while $T_1$ and $T_2$ de-repress; the free miRNA–RISC remains effectively unchanged.\n\nE. Argonaute’s catalytic turnover regenerates miRNA–RISC, so sequestration by a sponge cannot alter equilibrium occupancy; repression of native targets remains identical before and after sponge introduction.", "solution": "We start from the stated principles: reversible binding at equilibrium with dissociation constant $K_d$, conservation of total miRNA–RISC, and repression proportional to the number of occupied sites per transcript in the linear regime. Let $M_T$ be the total number of miRNA–RISC molecules, $M_f$ the free miRNA–RISC molecules at equilibrium, and let each seed site be a receptor for the ligand (miRNA–RISC). For a single class of sites with identical $K_d$ and no cooperativity, the fraction of sites occupied at equilibrium is the standard Langmuir form derived from mass action. From $K_d=\\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$ and $R_T=[R]+[RL]$, we obtain the occupancy per site $\\theta=\\frac{[RL]}{R_T}=\\frac{[L]}{K_d+[L]}$. Because the conversion between concentration and number of molecules is a constant factor $N_A V$, we may write the same form in terms of molecule numbers by replacing $[L]$ with $M_f$ and $K_d$ (in concentration units) with an equivalent number of molecules per cell, $K_d^\\#=K_d\\times N_A V$. First compute $K_d^\\#$. The number of molecules corresponding to $1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ in a cell of volume $V=2\\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{L}$ is $N_{\\mathrm{nM}}=N_A \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}\\times V=6.022\\times 10^{23}\\times 10^{-9}\\times 2\\times 10^{-12}\\approx 1.2044\\times 10^{3}$ molecules. Therefore $K_d^\\#=5\\,\\mathrm{nM}\\times 1.2044\\times 10^{3}\\approx 6.022\\times 10^{3}$ molecules. Let $N$ be the total number of seed sites in the system. If sites are independent and equivalent, the mean number of occupied sites is $N\\theta$, which equals the total number of miRNA–RISC bound to sites. Conservation of miRNA–RISC requires $M_T=M_f+N\\theta=M_f+N\\frac{M_f}{K_d^\\#+M_f}$. Before introducing the sponge ceRNA, the total number of native sites is $N_{\\mathrm{native}}=T_1:1000\\times 2 + T_2:500\\times 1 + T_3:200\\times 3=2000+500+600=3100$ sites. With $M_T=6000$ and $K_d^\\#\\approx 6000$, we solve for $M_f$ from $6000=M_f+3100\\frac{M_f}{6000+M_f}$. Multiply both sides by $(6000+M_f)$ to obtain $6000(6000+M_f)=M_f(6000+M_f)+3100M_f$. Simplifying, $36{,}000{,}000=M_f^2+3100M_f$. The positive root is $M_f=\\frac{-3100+\\sqrt{3100^2+4\\times 36{,}000{,}000}}{2}\\approx \\frac{-3100+\\sqrt{153{,}610{,}000}}{2}\\approx \\frac{-3100+12{,}392}{2}\\approx 4646$. The per-site occupancy is then $\\theta_{\\mathrm{before}}=\\frac{M_f}{K_d^\\#+M_f}\\approx \\frac{4646}{6000+4646}\\approx 0.436$. The mean number of bound miRNA–RISC per transcript is site-count–scaled: $T_1:2\\theta_{\\mathrm{before}}\\approx 0.872$, $T_2:1\\theta_{\\mathrm{before}}\\approx 0.436$, $T_3:3\\theta_{\\mathrm{before}}\\approx 1.308$. After introducing the sponge ceRNA $S$ at $2000$ molecules with $10$ sites each, we add $2000\\times 10=20{,}000$ sites, so the total becomes $N_{\\mathrm{total}}=3100+20{,}000=23{,}100$. Re-solving $6000=M_f+23{,}100\\frac{M_f}{6000+M_f}$ gives $36{,}000{,}000=M_f^2+23{,}100M_f$, with positive root $M_f=\\frac{-23{,}100+\\sqrt{23{,}100^2+4\\times 36{,}000{,}000}}{2}\\approx \\frac{-23{,}100+\\sqrt{677{,}610{,}000}}{2}\\approx \\frac{-23{,}100+26{,}039}{2}\\approx 1469$. The new per-site occupancy is $\\theta_{\\mathrm{after}}=\\frac{1469}{6000+1469}\\approx 0.197$. Thus, every site’s occupancy drops by a factor of approximately $\\frac{\\theta_{\\mathrm{after}}}{\\theta_{\\mathrm{before}}}\\approx \\frac{0.197}{0.436}\\approx 0.45$, a decrease of about $55\\%$. Because repression strength in this regime is proportional to the number of occupied sites per transcript, the repression on each target decreases proportionally: the mean occupied sites per transcript for $T_1$ drops from about $0.872$ to about $0.394$, for $T_2$ from about $0.436$ to about $0.197$, and for $T_3$ from about $1.308$ to about $0.591$. This corresponds to a roughly $2.2$-fold reduction in the occupied-site burden (and hence repression strength) across the board, with absolute magnitudes scaling with site count but the fractional change being essentially identical for all targets when affinities are equal and sites are independent. We now evaluate each option. Option A: It states that the free miRNA–RISC decreases from approximately $4.6\\times 10^3$ to approximately $1.5\\times 10^3$ molecules, per-site occupancy drops from about $0.44$ to about $0.20$ (a $\\sim 55\\%$ decrease), and that repression decreases proportionally across targets with similar fractional change. These values and qualitative conclusions match the calculations above. Verdict — Correct. Option B: Claims cooperative multivalency increases occupancy on native targets and strengthens repression. Our assumptions state independent, noncooperative sites and equal affinity; adding abundant competing sites reduces the free miRNA–RISC and lowers occupancy on all sites. Verdict — Incorrect. Option C: Claims a negligible change with free miRNA–RISC near $5.5\\times 10^3$. The computed change is substantial (from about $4646$ to about $1469$ free), and per-site occupancy nearly halves. Verdict — Incorrect. Option D: Claims redistribution preferentially increases repression of the highest-site target $T_3$ and leaves the free pool unchanged. With identical affinities and independent sites, occupancy is uniform across sites; adding many sponge sites reduces $M_f$ and uniformly reduces per-site occupancy. There is no mechanism for preferential strengthening of $T_3$ under the stated assumptions. Verdict — Incorrect. Option E: Argonaute catalytic turnover does not negate equilibrium sequestration; even if miRNA is recycled after action, at equilibrium a finite fraction is bound to available sites, and adding many high-affinity sites reduces $M_f$ and site occupancy. Moreover, animal miRNA–RISC typically represses without slicing at seed-only sites. Verdict — Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2848097"}]}
