Consider a well-mixed chemostat of constant volume in which the bacterial population density is constant at $X$ (cells per liter) due to balanced growth and washout. AHL is synthesized intracellularly by a LuxI-type enzyme at a constant per-cell rate $k_s$ (molecules per cell per second), rapidly equilibrates across the membrane, and can therefore be treated as produced directly into the extracellular medium. The inflowing fresh medium contains no AHL.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of mass balance and reaction kinetics as applied to a chemostat, which is a standard model system in microbiology and biochemical engineering. The problem is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution, and the parameter values are physically plausible. The only minor complication is the mixed time units ($s^{-1}$ and $h^{-1}$), which requires a standard unit conversion and does not constitute a flaw.\n\nWe proceed to the solution. The fundamental principle is the conservation of mass for the acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) species within the constant chemostat volume $V$. The mass balance equation for the concentration $A(t)$ is formulated by considering the rate of change of the total moles of AHL, $V A(t)$, in the reactor.\n\nThe rate of accumulation of AHL is equal to the rate of inflow minus the rate of outflow plus the net rate of generation.\n$$\n\\frac{d(V A)}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of Inflow}) - (\\text{Rate of Outflow}) + (\\text{Rate of Generation}) - (\\text{Rate of Loss})\n$$\nSince the volume $V$ is constant, the accumulation term simplifies to $V \\frac{dA}{dt}$.\n\nThe terms are defined as follows:\n1.  Rate of Inflow: The volumetric flow rate into the chemostat is $F$. The dilution rate is defined as $D = F/V$. The concentration of AHL in the inflow is given as $A_{in} = 0$. Thus, the rate of inflow of AHL is $F A_{in} = 0$.\n\n2.  Rate of Outflow: The concentration of AHL in the outflow is $A(t)$ due to the well-mixed assumption. The rate of outflow of AHL is $F A(t) = D V A(t)$.\n\n3.  Rate of Generation: AHL is produced by the bacteria. The total production rate is the per-cell rate $k_s$ multiplied by the total number of cells, $XV$. This gives a production rate in molecules per unit time per unit volume of $(k_s X)$. To express this in moles, we divide by Avogadro's number, $N_A$. The total molar production rate is $\\frac{k_s X V}{N_A}$.\n\n4.  Rate of Loss: AHL is lost via hydrolysis, which is a first-order process. The rate of loss due to hydrolysis is proportional to the total amount of AHL, given by $k_{\\text{hyd}} V A(t)$.\n\nCombining these terms into the mass balance equation:\n$$\nV \\frac{dA}{dt} = 0 - D V A(t) + \\frac{k_s X V}{N_A} - k_{\\text{hyd}} V A(t)\n$$\nThe volume $V$ is a common factor and can be canceled from all terms, yielding an equation for the concentration $A(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\frac{k_s X}{N_A} - D A(t) - k_{\\text{hyd}} A(t)\n$$\nWe must ensure consistent units. The rates $D$ and $k_{\\text{hyd}}$ are given in units of $\\text{h}^{-1}$, while the synthesis rate $k_s$ is in $\\text{molecules}\\,\\text{cell}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$. We must convert $k_s$ to an hourly rate. Let $C$ be the conversion factor, $C = 3600\\,\\text{s}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$. The hourly synthesis rate is $C k_s$.

The receptor, *LuxR*, can exist in one of three states: free $[R]$, bound to agonist $[RA]$, or bound to inhibitor $[RI]$.\nThus, the total concentration of *LuxR* monomers is:\n$$[R]_{total} = [R] + [RA] + [RI]$$\nThe fractional occupancy by the agonist $A$ is:\n$$\\theta_{A} = \\frac{[RA]}{[R]_{total}} = \\frac{[RA]}{[R] + [RA] + [RI]}$$\nThe problem provides the equilibrium dissociation constants for the agonist, $K_{A}$, and the inhibitor, $K_{I}$:\n$$K_{A} = \\frac{[R][A]}{[RA]}$$\n$$K_{I} = \\frac{[R][I]}{[RI]}$$\nWe can rearrange these equilibrium expressions to express the concentrations of the bound forms in terms of the free receptor concentration $[R]$:\n$$[RA] = \\frac{[R][A]}{K_{A}}$$\n$$[RI] = \\frac{[R][I]}{K_{I}}$$\nNow, we substitute these expressions back into the equation for $\\theta_{A}$:\n$$\\theta_{A} = \\frac{\\frac{[R][A]}{K_{A}}}{[R] + \\frac{[R][A]}{K_{A}} + \\frac{[R][I]}{K_{I}}}$$\nThe term for the free receptor concentration, $[R]$, is a common factor in all terms of the denominator and can be canceled with the $[R]$ in the numerator, yielding an expression for fractional occupancy that depends only on ligand concentrations and dissociation constants:\n$$\\theta_{A}([A],[I]) = \\frac{\\frac{[A]}{K_{A}}}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{A}} + \\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}}$$\nThis expression correctly describes the fractional occupancy of a single binding site by an agonist in the presence of a competitive inhibitor.\n\nThe problem states that the normalized promoter activity, $f([A],[I])$, is proportional to $\\theta_{A}^{n}$, where $n$ is an effective Hill coefficient. Since the activity is normalized, its maximum value must be $1$. As $[A] \\to \\infty$, $\\theta_{A} \\to 1$, so $f_{max} = 1^{n} = 1$. This implies that the proportionality constant is $1$.

This means the dose ratio is equal to $2$:\n$$\\frac{EC_{50}([I])}{EC_{50}(0)} = 2$$\nUsing the expression derived in Part 2:\n$$1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{I}} = 2$$\nSolving for $[I]$:\n$$\\frac{[I]}{K_{I}} = 2 - 1 = 1$$\n$$[I] = K_{I}$$\nThe problem provides the value $K_{I} = 83.7$ nM. Therefore, the required inhibitor concentration is:\n$$[I] = 83.7 \\text{ nM}$$\nThe given values for $n=2$ and $K_{A}=12$ nM are not required for this final calculation, which serves as a test of understanding the derived principles.

The mean transcription rate, $\\langle\\text{Rate}\\rangle$, is the sum of the rates from each state, weighted by their respective probabilities.\n$$\n\\langle\\text{Rate}\\rangle = \\sum_{i} p_i r_i = \\frac{1}{Z} \\sum_{i} W_i r_i\n$$\nThe only states with non-zero transcription are `$P$ only` and `$A$ and $P$ co-bound`.\n$$\n\\langle\\text{Rate}\\rangle = \\frac{W_P r_P + W_{AP} r_{AP}}{Z} = \\frac{n_P k + n_A n_P \\omega k f_A}{1 + n_P + n_A + n_R + n_A n_P \\omega}\n$$\nFactoring out common terms, we obtain the general expression for the mean transcription rate:\n$$\n\\langle\\text{Rate}\\rangle = k \\frac{n_P (1 + n_A \\omega f_A)}{1 + n_P + n_A + n_R + n_A n_P \\omega}\n$$\n\nNext, we must determine the basal transcription rate, $\\langle\\text{Rate}\\rangle_{\\text{basal}}$. This is the rate under the condition that the activator and repressor are absent, which means their concentrations are zero: $[A]=0$ and $[R]=0$. Consequently, their dimensionless activities are also zero: $n_A = 0$ and $n_R = 0$.\nSubstituting these values into the general rate expression:\n$$\n\\langle\\text{Rate}\\rangle_{\\text{basal}} = k \\frac{n_P (1 + (0) \\omega f_A)}{1 + n_P + (0) + (0) + (0) n_P \\omega} = k \\frac{n_P}{1 + n_P}\n$$\n\nThe fold-change, $FC$, is defined as the ratio of the full-system rate to the basal rate.\n$$\nFC = \\frac{\\langle\\text{Rate}\\rangle}{\\langle\\text{Rate}\\rangle_{\\text{basal}}}\n$$\n$$\nFC = \\frac{k \\frac{n_P (1 + n_A \\omega f_A)}{1 + n_P + n_A + n_R + n_A n_P \\omega}}{k \\frac{n_P}{1 + n_P}}\n$$\nAssuming $k \\neq 0$ and $n_P \\neq 0$ (otherwise basal expression is zero and fold-change is ill-defined), these terms cancel.\n$$\nFC = \\frac{1 + n_A \\omega f_A}{1 + n_P + n_A + n_R + n_A n_P \\omega} \\cdot (1 + n_P)\n$$\nThis expression can be rearranged for clarity by grouping terms in the denominator:\n$$\n1 + n_P + n_A + n_R + n_A n_P \\omega = (1 + n_P + n_R) + n_A(1 + n_P \\omega)\n$$\nThe final expression for the fold-change is therefore:\n$$\nFC = \\frac{(1 + n_P)(1 + n_A \\omega f_A)}{1 + n_P + n_R + n_A(1 + n_P \\omega)}\n$$\nThis is the complete and final analytical expression in terms of the required parameters.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{(1 + n_{P})(1 + n_{A} \\omega f_{A})}{1 + n_{P} + n_{R} + n_{A}(1 + n_{P} \\omega)}}\n$$", "id": "2844030"}]}
