This exercise introduces the chi-square ($\\chi^2$) test, a fundamental statistical tool used to determine if observed experimental outcomes align with the predictions of a genetic hypothesis.

The color of the light emitted by this fungus is determined by a single gene with two alleles. The allele `B` is associated with bright blue light, and the allele `G` is associated with glowing green light. The geneticist observes that when a pure-breeding blue-light fungus is crossed with a pure-breeding green-light fungus, all offspring emit an aqua-colored light. This suggests a pattern of incomplete dominance.\n\nTo investigate this further, the geneticist performs a cross between two fungi that both exhibit the aqua-colored bioluminescence. A total of 1000 spores from this cross are germinated and their phenotypes are recorded. The observed counts are: 228 fungi emitting bright blue light, 535 emitting aqua light, and 237 emitting glowing green light.\n\nTo test the hypothesis that this trait follows a simple Mendelian pattern of incomplete dominance, the researcher performs a chi-square ($\\chi^2$) test.

The null hypothesis is that the trait for bioluminescence color is controlled by a single gene with two alleles showing incomplete dominance, and that the observed phenotypic distribution in the offspring is statistically consistent with the expected Mendelian ratio for the given cross.\n\nNext, we determine the genotypes of the parents and the expected phenotypic ratio of the offspring. The problem states that the cross is between two fungi that both exhibit the aqua-colored phenotype. In incomplete dominance, the intermediate phenotype (aqua) corresponds to the heterozygous genotype. Therefore, both parents have the genotype BG.\n\nThe cross is BG $\\times$ BG.
