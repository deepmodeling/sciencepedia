This foundational exercise requires you to derive the expected phenotypic outcomes of an X-linked recessive trait from first principles, starting with a classic parental cross and proceeding through two generations.

In the X–Y sex-determination system, individuals with genotype $X^{A}X^{A}$ or $X^{A}X^{a}$ are unaffected females, individuals with genotype $X^{a}X^{a}$ are affected females, individuals with genotype $X^{A}Y$ are unaffected males, and individuals with genotype $X^{a}Y$ are affected males. Assume Mendel’s law of segregation holds for alleles during gametogenesis, gametes bearing $X$ or $Y$ chromosomes are produced in equal proportions by males, mating is random with respect to genotype, the sex ratio at birth is $1:1$, there is complete penetrance, and there is no selection, mutation, or meiotic drive.\n\nA true-breeding affected male (genotype $X^{a}Y$) is crossed to an unaffected homozygous female (genotype $X^{A}X^{A}$) to produce the first filial generation $F_{1}$.

It is free from ambiguity and subjective claims.\n- **Conclusion**: The problem is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It is deemed **valid**.\n\n**Step 3: Solution Derivation**\n\nWe proceed with the logical derivation of the solution.\n\n**Analysis of the $F_{1}$ Generation**\nThe parental cross is between a male of genotype $X^{a}Y$ and a female of genotype $X^{A}X^{A}$.\nThe female parent is homozygous and produces only one type of gamete, $X^{A}$, with probability $1$.\nThe male parent produces two types of gametes, $X^{a}$ and $Y$, with equal probability $1/2$ each.\n\nThe genotypes of the $F_{1}$ generation are determined by the possible combinations of these gametes. We can represent this with a Punnett square:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c}\n  X^{A} \\\\\n\\hline\nX^{a}  X^{A}X^{a} \\\\\n\\hline\nY  X^{A}Y\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe offspring genotypes are $X^{A}X^{a}$ and $X^{A}Y$, each occurring with a frequency of $1/2$.\n- $F_{1}$ females all have the genotype $X^{A}X^{a}$. Since $A$ is dominant, they are phenotypically unaffected.\n- $F_{1}$ males all have the genotype $X^{A}Y$. They are phenotypically unaffected.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic composition of the $F_{1}$ generation is:\n- Females: All are unaffected.\n- Males: All are unaffected.\n\n**Analysis of the $F_{2}$ Generation**\nThe $F_{2}$ generation is produced by mating a randomly chosen $F_{1}$ female with a randomly chosen $F_{1}$ male. Since all $F_{1}$ females are $X^{A}X^{a}$ and all $F_{1}$ males are $X^{A}Y$, this cross is fixed: $X^{A}X^{a} \\times X^{A}Y$.\n\n- The $F_{1}$ female ($X^{A}X^{a}$) produces two types of gametes, $X^{A}$ and $X^{a}$, with equal probability $1/2$ each.\n- The $F_{1}$ male ($X^{A}Y$) produces two types of gametes, $X^{A}$ and $Y$, with equal probability $1/2$ each.\n\nThe genotypes of the $F_{2}$ generation are determined by the combinations of these gametes, as shown in the following Punnett square. Each cell represents a proportion of $1/4$ of the total $F_{2}$ population.\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n  X^{A} \\text{ (from male)}  Y \\text{ (from male)} \\\\\n\\hline\nX^{A} \\text{ (from female)}  X^{A}X^{A}  X^{A}Y \\\\\nX^{a} \\text{ (from female)}  X^{A}X^{a}  X^{a}Y\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe four equally probable genotypes in the $F_{2}$ generation, each with frequency $1/4$, are:\n- $X^{A}X^{A}$: Unaffected female.\n- $X^{A}X^{a}$: Unaffected female.\n- $X^{A}Y$: Unaffected male.\n- $X^{a}Y$: Affected male.\n\nThe phenotypic composition of the $F_{2}$ generation by sex is as follows:\n- **Females**: The female offspring have genotypes $X^{A}X^{A}$ (frequency $1/4$) and $X^{A}X^{a}$ (frequency $1/4$). Both genotypes result in an unaffected phenotype. Thus, among the total female population (which comprises a fraction $1/2$ of $F_{2}$), all are unaffected.\n- **Males**: The male offspring have genotypes $X^{A}Y$ (frequency $1/4$) and $X^{a}Y$ (frequency $1/4$). The genotype $X^{A}Y$ corresponds to an unaffected phenotype, while $X^{a}Y$ corresponds to an affected phenotype. Thus, among the total male population (which comprises a fraction $1/2$ of $F_{2}$), a fraction of $1/2$ are unaffected and a fraction of $1/2$ are affected.\n\n**Final Calculation: Overall Fraction of Affected Individuals in $F_{2}$**\nThe problem asks for the overall fraction of affected individuals in the pooled $F_{2}$ population. We must sum the frequencies of all genotypes that lead to an affected phenotype.\n- The frequency of affected females (genotype $X^{a}X^{a}$) is $0$.\n- The frequency of affected males (genotype $X^{a}Y$) is $1/4$.\n\nThe total fraction of affected individuals in the $F_{2}$ generation is the sum of these frequencies:\n$$\n\\text{Fraction affected} = P(X^{a}X^{a}) + P(X^{a}Y) = 0 + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nThis is a reduced fraction as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$$", "id": "2791098"}, {"introduction": "Genetic risk is not determined in a vacuum; it is profoundly influenced by the mating structure of a population. This problem moves beyond simple random mating to explore the impact of consanguinity on disease probability, a critical consideration in clinical genetics and population studies.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, free of contradictions or ambiguities. It presents a standard problem in population genetics that can be solved from first principles as requested.\n\nWe will address the two scenarios sequentially.\n\n**Scenario 1: Autosomal Recessive Inheritance**\n\nThe objective is to find the probability that the child of first-cousin parents has the genotype $aa$. This probability is denoted as $P(aa)$.\n\nThe population is in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium with allele frequencies $p$ for allele $A$ and $q$ for allele $a$.\n\nThe inbreeding coefficient, $F$, is defined as the probability that the two alleles at a given locus in an individual are identical by descent (IBD). For the offspring of a first-cousin mating, we are given $F = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nTo find the total probability of genotype $aa$, we consider two mutually exclusive events for the child's pair of alleles at this locus:\n1. The two alleles are identical by descent. The probability of this event is, by definition, $F$. If the alleles are IBD, they must be copies of a single allele from a common ancestor. For the child to have genotype $aa$, this single ancestral allele must have been of type $a$. The probability that a randomly chosen allele in the population's gene pool is $a$ is $q$. Therefore, the probability that the two alleles are IBD *and* are both of type $a$ is $F \\times q$.\n\n2. The two alleles are not identical by descent. The probability of this event is $(1 - F)$. If the alleles are not IBD, they are considered to be two independent draws from the population's gene pool. The probability of drawing an allele of type $a$ is $q$. The probability of independently drawing two alleles of type $a$ is $q \\times q = q^2$. Therefore, the probability that the two alleles are not IBD *and* are both of type $a$ is $(1 - F) \\times q^2$.\n\nThe total probability of the child having genotype $aa$ is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events:\n$$\nP(aa) = P(\\text{alleles are IBD and type } a) + P(\\text{alleles are not IBD and type } a)\n$$\n$$\nP(aa) = (F \\cdot q) + ((1 - F) \\cdot q^2)\n$$\nThis is the general formula for the frequency of a homozygous recessive genotype in a population with an average inbreeding coefficient of $F$.\n\nFor this specific problem, the parents are first cousins, so their child has an inbreeding coefficient of $F = \\frac{1}{16}$. Substituting this value into the derived expression:\n$$\nP(aa) = \\frac{1}{16} q + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{16}\\right) q^2\n$$\n$$\nP(aa) = \\frac{1}{16} q + \\frac{15}{16} q^2\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the probability of the child being affected in Scenario 1.\n\n**Scenario 2: X-linked Recessive Inheritance**\n\nThe objective is to find the probability that a male child of the same two first-cousin parents is affected. A male is affected if his genotype is $X_aY$.\n\nA male inherits his Y chromosome from his father and his X chromosome from his mother. Therefore, a male child's phenotype for an X-linked trait is determined exclusively by the allele on the X chromosome contributed by his mother. The genetic makeup of the father is irrelevant to the son's X-linked genotype.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that the male child is affected, which is the probability that he inherits an $X_a$ chromosome from his mother. This probability is equal to the frequency of the $X_a$ allele in the mother's gametes (ova).\n\nThe mother is one of the two first cousins. The problem states that the general population is panmictic, with the specified first-cousin mating being the only non-random mating under consideration. This implies that the mother herself is an individual drawn from the general population and is not the product of a consanguineous mating. Her genotype is determined by her parents, who are assumed to have mated randomly.\n\nThe problem states that the population is in \"sex-neutral equilibrium for the X chromosome so that the frequency of $a$ among X chromosomes is $q$.\" This means the frequency of the $X_a$ allele is $q$ in the entire pool of X chromosomes, which includes those in females and males.\nA female has two X chromosomes. As she is a random individual from the population, her two X chromosomes are considered independent samples from the population's X chromosome gene pool. The probability that any given X chromosome is of type $X_a$ is $q$.\n\nAccording to the law of segregation, the mother passes one of her two X chromosomes to her son, chosen at random with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ for each. Let the mother's two X chromosomes be $X_1$ and $X_2$. The probability that the son is affected is:\n$$\nP(\\text{son is } X_aY) = P(\\text{mother passes } X_a)\n$$\n$$\nP(\\text{mother passes } X_a) = \\frac{1}{2} P(X_1 \\text{ is } X_a) + \\frac{1}{2} P(X_2 \\text{ is } X_a)\n$$\nSince each chromosome is an independent sample from the gene pool where the frequency of $X_a$ is $q$:\n$$\nP(X_1 \\text{ is } X_a) = q\n$$\n$$\nP(X_2 \\text{ is } X_a) = q\n$$\nSubstituting these probabilities back gives:\n$$\nP(\\text{son is } X_aY) = \\frac{1}{2} q + \\frac{1}{2} q = q\n$$\nThe information that the mother's mating partner is her first cousin is extraneous to the calculation of her son's risk for an X-linked trait, as this risk depends only on her genetic constitution, which is established prior to this specific mating.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the male child is affected in Scenario 2 is simply $q$.\n\nThe final answer requires the two expressions for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, in that order.\nScenario 1 probability: $\\frac{15}{16}q^2 + \\frac{1}{16}q$\nScenario 2 probability: $q$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{15}{16}q^2 + \\frac{1}{16}q  q \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2791152"}, {"introduction": "In genetic research, the mode of inheritance for a newly discovered disease is often a hypothesis to be tested, not a given fact.

You will learn to calculate the likelihood of a dataset under both autosomal recessive (AR) and X-linked recessive (XLR) models and use their ratio to quantify the strength of evidence, demonstrating how patterns in pedigree data can decisively favor one biological explanation over another [@problem_id:2791096].", "problem": "A genetic researcher is comparing two locus models for a rare, fully penetrant Mendelian disease using a sample of affected sibships. The two competing models are: autosomal recessive (AR) and X-linked recessive (XLR). The following assumptions define the data-generating process and the inference target.\n\n- The disease is caused by a single locus with full penetrance in the relevant disease genotype, no phenocopies, and negligible de novo mutation during meiosis.\n- Under the autosomal recessive (AR) model, affected individuals have genotype $aa$ and, conditional on being affected, the biological sex of an affected child is independent of disease status and is male with probability $1/2$ and female with probability $1/2$ (reflecting an equal sex ratio at birth and autosomal inheritance unlinked to sex).\n- Under the X-linked recessive (XLR) model in this study population, no fathers in the sampled sibships are affected, mothers may be carriers, and affected females are assumed impossible under the model (i.e., the probability that an affected child is female is $0$).\n- Ascertainment is by the presence of at least one affected child per family, and ascertainment does not depend on the sex of the affected child or children. Families are independent.\n- Only the sexes of affected children are recorded; the number and sexes of unaffected children are not used.\n\nLet the dataset consist of $8$ sibships with the following observed counts of affected children and their sexes:\n\n- Family $1$: $1$ affected male.\n- Family $2$: $2$ affected males.\n- Family $3$: $1$ affected male.\n- Family $4$: $3$ affected males.\n- Family $5$: $2$ affected males.\n- Family $6$: $1$ affected male.\n- Family $7$: $4$ affected males.\n- Family $8$: $2$ affected males.\n\nDefine the Bayes factor (BF) in favor of the X-linked recessive (XLR) model against the autosomal recessive (AR) model as the ratio of marginal likelihoods,\n$$\n\\text{BF}_{\\mathrm{XLR}:\\mathrm{AR}} \\equiv \\frac{P(D \\mid \\text{XLR})}{P(D \\mid \\text{AR})},\n$$\nwhere $D$ denotes the observed data consisting of the sex labels of affected children in each family, together with the information that each family has at least one affected child.\n\nStarting from the basic principles of Mendelian segregation and the definitions above, derive an expression for $\\text{BF}_{\\mathrm{XLR}:\\mathrm{AR}}$ for a general collection of families with $k_i$ affected children in family $i$ and $m_i$ of those $k_i$ affected children being male.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a Bayes factor, $\\text{BF}_{\\mathrm{XLR}:\\mathrm{AR}}$, to compare two genetic models: X-linked recessive (XLR) and autosomal recessive (AR). The Bayes factor is defined as the ratio of the marginal likelihoods of the observed data, $D$, under each model:\n$$\n\\text{BF}_{\\mathrm{XLR}:\\mathrm{AR}} = \\frac{P(D \\mid \\text{XLR})}{P(D \\mid \\text{AR})}\n$$\nThe data $D$ consists of observations from $N$ independent families. For each family $i$, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N$, we observe $k_i$ affected children, of whom $m_i$ are male and $k_i - m_i$ are female. Since the families are independent, the total likelihood for each model is the product of the likelihoods for each family:\n$$\nP(D \\mid M) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} P(D_i \\mid M)\n$$\nwhere $M$ represents either the AR or XLR model, and $D_i$ is the data from family $i$.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the likelihood for a single family, $P(D_i \\mid M)$, which is the probability of observing $m_i$ males and $k_i-m_i$ females among the $k_i$ affected children, given the model $M$. The problem states that the number and sexes of unaffected children are not used, which implies our analysis should be conditional on the observed number of affected children, $k_i$. Let $p_M$ be the probability that an affected child is male, given model $M$. The number of males, $m_i$, among $k_i$ affected children follows a binomial distribution. The likelihood for family $i$ is thus:\n$$\nP(D_i \\mid M) = \\binom{k_i}{m_i} p_M^{m_i} (1-p_M)^{k_i - m_i}\n$$\nThe ascertainment condition, that each family has at least one affected child, and that ascertainment does not depend on sex, simplifies the analysis. The probabilities of segregation leading to an affected child are identical for both models (parents are $Aa \\times Aa$ for AR, giving a $1/4$ chance of an affected child; parents are $X^A X^a \\times X^A Y$ for XLR, giving a $1/2 \\times 1/2 = 1/4$ chance of an affected child). This symmetry, along with the sex-independent ascertainment, means that factors related to sibship size and the probability of ascertainment cancel out in the Bayes factor ratio, validating the use of the simple binomial likelihood above.\n\nNext, we must determine $p_M$ for each model from the problem statement.\n\nFor the autosomal recessive (AR) model, it is stated that the sex of an affected child is male with probability $1/2$ and female with probability $1/2$. Thus,\n$$\np_{\\text{AR}} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe likelihood for family $i$ under the AR model is:\n$$\nP(D_i \\mid \\text{AR}) = \\binom{k_i}{m_i} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{m_i} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{k_i - m_i} = \\binom{k_i}{m_i} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{k_i}\n$$\n\nFor the X-linked recessive (XLR) model, it is stated that affected females are impossible, meaning the probability that an affected child is female is $0$. Consequently, any affected child must be male.\n$$\np_{\\text{XLR}} = 1\n$$\nThe likelihood for family $i$ under the XLR model is:\n$$\nP(D_i \\mid \\text{XLR}) = \\binom{k_i}{m_i} (1)^{m_i} (0)^{k_i - m_i}\n$$\nThis expression evaluates to $0$ if $k_i - m_i > 0$, i.e., if there is at least one affected female ($m_i  k_i$). If $k_i - m_i = 0$, i.e., all affected children are male ($m_i = k_i$), the term becomes $\\binom{k_i}{k_i} (1)^{k_i} (0)^0$. Using the convention that $0^0=1$, this simplifies to $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\nSo, we can write the likelihood for the XLR model as:\n$$\nP(D_i \\mid \\text{XLR}) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1  \\text{if } m_i = k_i \\\\\n0  \\text{if } m_i  k_i\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNow we can write the general expression for the Bayes factor for a set of $N$ families:\n$$\n\\text{BF}_{\\mathrm{XLR}:\\mathrm{AR}} = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^{N} P(D_i \\mid \\text{XLR})}{\\prod_{i=1}^{N} P(D_i \\mid \\text{AR})} = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } m_i = k_i \\\\ 0  \\text{if } m_i  k_i \\end{cases}}{\\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\left[ \\binom{k_i}{m_i} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{k_i} \\right]}\n$$\nFrom this general formula, we can deduce two scenarios:\n1. If there is at least one family $j$ with an affected female ($m_j  k_j$), the numerator becomes $0$, and therefore $\\text{BF}_{\\mathrm{XLR}:\\mathrm{AR}} = 0$. This is logical, as the observation of an affected female is impossible under the specified XLR model.\n2. If all affected children in all $N$ families are male ($m_i = k_i$ for all $i=1, \\dots, N$), then the numerator is $1$. For the denominator, $\\binom{k_i}{m_i} = \\binom{k_i}{k_i} = 1$ for all $i$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{BF}_{\\mathrm{XLR}:\\mathrm{AR}} = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\left[1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{k_i} \\right]} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} k_i}} = 2^{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} k_i}\n$$\nThis is the derived general expression for the Bayes factor.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression for the given dataset of $N=8$ families.\nThe data are:\n- Family $1$: $k_1=1, m_1=1$\n- Family $2$: $k_2=2, m_2=2$\n- Family $3$: $k_3=1, m_3=1$\n- Family $4$: $k_4=3, m_4=3$\n- Family $5$: $k_5=2, m_5=2$\n- Family $6$: $k_6=1, m_6=1$\n- Family $7$: $k_7=4, m_7=4$\n- Family $8$: $k_8=2, m_8=2$\n\nIn every family, all affected children are male, so $m_i = k_i$ for all $i=1, \\dots, 8$.

We calculate the total number of affected children, $\\sum k_i$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{8} k_i = 1+2+1+3+2+1+4+2 = 16\n$$\nThe Bayes factor is then calculated using our derived formula:\n$$\n\\text{BF}_{\\mathrm{XLR}:\\mathrm{AR}} = 2^{\\sum k_i} = 2^{16}\n$$\nComputing the value:\n$$\n2^{16} = 2^{10} \\times 2^6 = 1024 \\times 64 = 65536\n$$\nThe data are $65536$ times more likely under the X-linked recessive model than under the autosomal recessive model.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{65536}\n$$", "id": "2791096"}]}
