The most direct approach is to reduce this system of five equations and five unknowns to a single equation in one variable. A convenient choice for this variable is the concentration of the free common reactant, $C$.\n\nFrom equations (2) and (4), we express $CE$ in terms of $C$:\n$E = E_{\\mathrm{T}} - CE$.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe core of the system is the regulation of CDK1 activity, which we denote by $A$. The steady-state activity $A_{ss}$ is determined by a balance between activation and inactivation processes, which are in turn functions of $A$ itself (due to feedback) and the input parameter, cyclin concentration $C$.\n\nLet us analyze the forces governing the steady-state level of $A$. The activity of CDK1 is established by phosphorylation events. Its own activity is switched on by the phosphatase Cdc25 and switched off by the kinase Wee1.\n\nThe crucial feature is the double positive feedback: active CDK1 promotes its own activation by activating Cdc25 and inhibiting Wee1. This self-amplifying nature of CDK1 activity is what allows for a strong, switch-like response.\n\nThe antagonistic phosphatase, with effective activity $P$, opposes these feedback loops. It acts to:\n1.  Inactivate Cdc25 (by dephosphorylation), thereby counteracting CDK1's attempt to activate its own activator.\n2.  Activate Wee1 (by dephosphorylation), thereby counteracting CDK1's attempt to inhibit its own inhibitor.\n\nIn essence, the parameter $P$ represents the strength of the \"opposition\" to CDK1 auto-activation. The a priori drive for CDK1 activation is provided by the concentration of its cyclin partner, $C$.\n\nConsider the steady state where the rate of CDK1 activation balances its rate of inactivation. For any given level of cyclin $C$, an increase in phosphatase activity $P$ will have two synergistic effects, both of which suppress CDK1 activity: the activation pathway via Cdc25 is weakened, and the inactivation pathway via Wee1 is strengthened.\n\nConsequently, to achieve any specific level of steady-state CDK1 activity, $A_{ss}$, a stronger initial stimulus is required to overcome the increased opposition from $P$. The initial stimulus is the cyclin concentration, $C$. Therefore, for a fixed $A_{ss}$, a higher $P$ necessitates a higher $C$.\n\nGeometrically, this means that the S-shaped curve representing the steady-state CDK1 activity $A_{ss}$ as a function of $C$ shifts to the right (towards higher values of $C$) as $P$ increases.\n\nThe thresholds $C_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{off}}$ are the $C$-coordinates of the saddle-node bifurcation points, which correspond to the \"knees\" of the S-shaped curve.\n-   $C_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is the point where the lower, low-activity state disappears, forcing a jump to the high-activity state. This is the rightmost point of the lower branch.\n-   $C_{\\mathrm{off}}$ is the point where the upper, high-activity state disappears, forcing a jump to the low-activity state. This is the leftmost point of the upper branch.\n\nSince the entire S-shaped curve shifts to the right along the $C$-axis, both of these characteristic points, $C_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{off}}$, must also shift to higher values of $C$.\n\nNow, let us consider the width of the hysteresis window, which is given by the difference $C_{\\mathrm{on}} - C_{\\mathrm{off}}$. Hysteresis and bistability are direct consequences of the strong positive feedback. The phosphatase activity $P$ directly antagonizes this feedback. By increasing $P$, we weaken the effective strength of the positive feedback loops. As the feedback weakens, the S-shape of the curve becomes less pronounced—the bistable region shrinks. In the limit where $P$ is large enough to completely overwhelm the feedback, the response becomes monotonic, and bistability is lost. Therefore, as $P$ increases, the two bifurcation points $C_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{off}}$ must move closer together, causing the hysteresis window to shrink.\n\nIn summary, increasing phosphatase activity $P$ has the following effects:\n1.  The mitotic entry threshold $C_{\\mathrm{on}}$ increases.\n2.  The mitotic exit threshold $C_{\\mathrm{off}}$ also increases.\n3.  The hysteresis window size, $C_{\\mathrm{on}} - C_{\\mathrm{off}}$, decreases.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nA. **Both $C_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{off}}$ shift to higher $C$ (larger cyclin level is required to enter mitosis; exit occurs at a larger cyclin level), and the hysteresis window tends to shrink.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with our derivation. Increasing the antagonistic phosphatase activity makes it harder to turn CDK1 on and easier to turn it off, relative to the state of the feedback loop. This requires more cyclin C to achieve both entry and to sustain the active state, hence both thresholds shift to higher $C$. The weakening of the positive feedback shrinks the bistable region.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. **$C_{\\mathrm{on}}$ increases (shifts to higher $C$), whereas $C_{\\mathrm{off}}$ decreases (shifts to lower $C$), expanding the hysteresis window.**\nThis is incorrect. A decrease in $C_{\\mathrm{off}}$ would imply that the active state is *more* stable at low cyclin levels, which contradicts the role of the phosphatase $P$ in promoting inactivation of CDK1. This scenario describes an expansion of the hysteresis window, which would correspond to a strengthening, not a weakening, of the positive feedback.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. **Both $C_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{off}}$ shift to lower $C$ (smaller cyclin level is sufficient to enter mitosis; exit occurs at a smaller cyclin level).**\nThis is incorrect. This describes the effect of *decreasing* the phosphatase activity $P$, or equivalently, strengthening the positive feedback mechanisms.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. **$C_{\\mathrm{on}}$ decreases (shifts to lower $C$), whereas $C_{\\mathrm{off}}$ increases (shifts to higher $C$), reversing the hysteresis orientation.**\nThis is logically and physically nonsensical. For hysteresis to exist, it is necessary that $C_{\\mathrm{on}} > C_{\\mathrm{off}}$. If $C_{\\mathrm{on}}$ were to decrease while $C_{\\mathrm{off}}$ increases, the bistable region would shrink and eventually vanish. If they were to cross, so that $C_{\\mathrm{on}} < C_{\\mathrm{off}}$, the system would no longer be a hysteretic switch. \"Reversing the hysteresis orientation\" has no meaning in this context.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2857458"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical models of cell cycle control must ultimately be tested and refined against experimental measurements.

The problem is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, and complete. It is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be derived by rigorously following the specified algorithm.\n\nThe core task is to determine the durations of the $G1$ and $S/G2/M$ phases of the eukaryotic cell cycle from fluorescent intensity traces and to quantify their cell-to-cell variability. The solution methodology proceeds in a sequence of discrete, formal steps for each single-cell trace.\n\nFirst, we are given time-series data for a red reporter ($R[i]$) and a green reporter ($G[i]$) at discrete time points $i$ from $0$ to $E-1$, sampled at an interval of $\\Delta t$. The $R$ signal is high in the $G1$ phase, while the $G$ signal is high in the $S/G2/M$ phases.\n\nTo mitigate measurement noise, a common source of error in fluorescence microscopy, the problem mandates the application of a centered moving median filter with a window size $w=3$ to both time series. For a given series $X[i]$, the filtered value $X_{\\text{med}}[i]$ is the median of $\\{X[i-1], X[i], X[i+1]\\}$. To handle the boundaries of the series ($i=0$ and $i=E-1$), edge-padding is specified, where the boundary values are replicated. This ensures the filtered series $R_{\\text{med}}$ and $G_{\\text{med}}$ have the same length $E$ as the original data. This filtering step smoothens spurious spikes while preserving sharp transitions, which is advantageous for detecting the cell cycle phase switch.\n\nNext, a decision variable, $\\delta[i]$, is defined as the difference between the filtered green and red intensities:\n$$\n\\delta[i] = G_{\\text{med}}[i] - R_{\\text{med}}[i]\n$$\nThis variable quantifies the relative dominance of the two reporters. A positive value of $\\delta[i]$ indicates that the green reporter ($S/G2/M$ marker) is stronger than the red one ($G1$ marker), and vice-versa. The phase transition is determined by a strict threshold $\\theta = 0$. A cell is in $G1$ when $\\delta[i] \\le \\theta$ and in $S/G2/M$ when $\\delta[i] > \\theta$.\n\nTo ensure the detected transition is not a transient fluctuation, a robustness criterion is imposed. The G1-to-S transition is marked by the first time index, $i^\\ast$, where $\\delta[i]$ remains positive for $h$ consecutive frames. Formally, $i^\\ast$ is the smallest index $i$ in $[0, E-h]$ such that $\\delta[k] > 0$ for all $k \\in [i, i+h-1]$. If no such index exists in the data, the transition is considered undefined for that cell.\n\nOnce $i^\\ast$ is determined, the phase durations are calculated. The $G1$ phase comprises all time frames up to the transition, so its duration is:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{G1}} = i^\\ast \\cdot \\Delta t\n$$\nThe $S/G2/M$ phase comprises the remaining frames of the observation. Its duration is:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{S/G2/M}} = (E - i^\\ast) \\cdot \\Delta t\n$$\nIf $i^\\ast$ is not found, both $T_{\\mathrm{G1}}$ and $T_{\\mathrm{S/G2/M}}$ are set to Not-a-Number (NaN) to signify the undefined state.\n\nFinally, to quantify cell-to-cell variability, the coefficient of variation (CV) is computed for the set of $G1$ durations and the set of $S/G2/M$ durations. The CV is a standardized measure of dispersion, defined as the ratio of the population standard deviation $\\sigma$ to the mean $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CV} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{n}(x_k - \\mu)^2}}{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{n} x_k}\n$$\nThis calculation is performed only on the cells for which the durations are defined (i.e., not NaN).\n\nApplying this procedure to the provided test cases:\n\n**Case A**: $\\Delta t=0.5, w=3, h=2, E=16$\n$R_{\\text{med}} = [78, 78, 75, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 27, 25, 24, 23]$\n$G_{\\text{med}} = [10, 12, 14, 18, 22, 28, 35, 43, 52, 60, 68, 74, 78, 80, 82, 83]$\n$\\delta = [-68, -66, -61, -52, -43, -32, -20, -7, 7, 20, 33, 44, 51, 55, 58, 60]$\nThe first index $i$ such that $\\delta[i]>0$ and $\\delta[i+1]>0$ is $i^\\ast = 8$.\n$T_{\\mathrm{G1}} = 8 \\cdot 0.5 = 4.0$ hours.\n$T_{\\mathrm{S/G2/M}} = (16 - 8) \\cdot 0.5 = 4.0$ hours.\n\n**Case B**: $\\Delta t=0.5, w=3, h=2, E=16$\n$R_{\\text{med}} = [88, 88, 86, 84, 80, 76, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50, 45, 40, 38, 36, 34]$\n$G_{\\text{med}} = [8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 20, 50, 52, 52, 54, 60, 70, 80, 85]$\n$\\delta = [-80, -79, -76, -73, -67, -61, -53, -45, -10, -3, 2, 9, 20, 32, 44, 51]$\nThe first index $i$ such that $\\delta[i]>0$ and $\\delta[i+1]>0$ is $i^\\ast = 10$.\n$T_{\\mathrm{G1}} = 10 \\cdot 0.5 = 5.0$ hours.\n$T_{\\mathrm{S/G2/M}} = (16 - 10) \\cdot 0.5 = 3.0$ hours.\n\n**Case C**: $\\Delta t=0.5, w=3, h=2, E=10$\n$R_{\\text{med}} = [48, 48, 46, 44, 40, 38, 35, 34, 33, 32]$\n$G_{\\text{med}} = [55, 58, 60, 62, 65, 68, 70, 72, 74, 75]$\n$\\delta = [7, 10, 14, 18, 25, 30, 35, 38, 41, 43]$\nThe first index $i$ such that $\\delta[i]>0$ and $\\delta[i+1]>0$ is $i^\\ast = 0$.\n$T_{\\mathrm{G1}} = 0 \\cdot 0.5 = 0.0$ hours.\n$T_{\\mathrm{S/G2/M}} = (10 - 0) \\cdot 0.5 = 5.0$ hours.\n\n**Case D**: $\\Delta t=0.5, w=3, h=2, E=14$\n$R_{\\text{med}} = [118, 118, 116, 114, 112, 110, 108, 106, 100, 90, 80, 60, 40, 30]$\n$G_{\\text{med}} = [5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 55, 70, 90]$\n$\\delta = [-113, -113, -110, -108, -105, -102, -99, -96, -80, -60, -40, -5, 30, 60]$\nThe first index $i$ such that $\\delta[i]>0$ and $\\delta[i+1]>0$ is $i^\\ast = 12$.\n$T_{\\mathrm{G1}} = 12 \\cdot 0.5 = 6.0$ hours.\n$T_{\\mathrm{S/G2/M}} = (14 - 12) \\cdot 0.5 = 1.0$ hour.\n\n**Coefficient of Variation Calculation**:\nFor $T_{\\mathrm{G1}}$ values $\\{4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 6.0\\}$:\n$\\mu_{\\mathrm{G1}} = (4.0 + 5.0 + 0.0 + 6.0)/4 = 3.75$\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{G1}} = \\sqrt{((4-3.75)^2 + (5-3.75)^2 + (0-3.75)^2 + (6-3.75)^2)/4} = \\sqrt{5.1875} \\approx 2.2776$\n$\\mathrm{CV}_{\\mathrm{G1}} = 2.2776 / 3.75 \\approx 0.607$\n\nFor $T_{\\mathrm{S/G2/M}}$ values $\\{4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 1.0\\}$:\n$\\mu_{\\mathrm{S/G2/M}} = (4.0 + 3.0 + 5.0 + 1.0)/4 = 3.25$\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{S/G2/M}} = \\sqrt{((4-3.25)^2 + (3-3.25)^2 + (5-3.25)^2 + (1-3.25)^2)/4} = \\sqrt{2.1875} \\approx 1.4790$\n$\\mathrm{CV}_{\\mathrm{S/G2/M}} = 1.4790 / 3.25 \\approx 0.455$\n\nAll results will be rounded to three decimal places for the final output.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\texttt{[[4.000,5.000,0.000,6.000],[4.000,3.000,5.000,1.000],0.607,0.455]}}$$", "id": "2857561"}]}
