Two molecular features enforce the meiosis I program: co-orientation of sister kinetochores and protection of centromeric cohesin by Shugoshin-Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) until anaphase II. Consider an organism with ordered tetrads (for example, a filamentous fungus) in which the linear order of the four spores records the two meiotic divisions in sequence. You perform a cross heterozygous at a single centromere-linked locus, with alleles $A$ and $a$, at $0$ map distance from the centromere (assume $0$ recombination between the marker and the centromere on that chromosome). Assume that all divisions that do occur complete and that meiosis II spindle geometry is normal, so that if chromatids that should segregate can segregate, they do so to opposite poles at the appropriate stage. Select all options that correctly identify the mechanistic conditions under which equational segregation occurs at meiosis I in a mutant, and correctly predict the resulting ordered tetrad genotype pattern at the $A/a$ locus. Use the convention that the spore order reflects progression through meiosis I followed by meiosis II. In wild type under these conditions, the ordered tetrad pattern is first-division segregation $A\\,A\\,a\\,a$ for $100\\%$ of tetrads, whereas equational segregation at meiosis I would instead produce second-division segregation patterns $A\\,a\\,A\\,a$ or $a\\,A\\,a\\,A$ for $100\\%$ of tetrads.\n\nA.

The problem must first be validated for scientific soundness and logical consistency before a solution is derived.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Cellular Process:** A comparison between meiosis $I$ and meiosis $II$.\n- **Normal Meiosis I:** Reductional segregation. Homologous chromosomes segregate. Sister chromatids co-segregate.\n- **Normal Meiosis II:** Equational segregation. Sister chromatids segregate.\n- **Molecular Machinery for Meiosis I:**\n    1.  Co-orientation of sister kinetochores.\n    2.  Protection of centromeric cohesin by the Shugoshin-Protein Phosphatase $2$A (PP$2$A) complex.\n- **Experimental System:** An organism with ordered tetrads (e.g., filamentous fungus).\n- **Genetic Cross:** Heterozygous at a single locus with alleles $A$ and $a$.\n- **Locus Position:** The locus is centromere-linked with $0$ map distance from the centromere, implying no recombination between the marker and the centromere.\n- **Assumptions:** All divisions complete successfully. Meiosis $II$ spindle geometry is normal.\n- **Wild-Type Tetrad Pattern:** $100\\%$ first-division segregation, with genotype pattern $A\\,A\\,a\\,a$.\n- **Mutant Tetrad Pattern (Definition):** Equational segregation at meiosis $I$ is defined as producing $100\\%$ second-division segregation patterns, $A\\,a\\,A\\,a$ or $a\\,A\\,a\\,A$.\n- **Task:** Identify the correct mechanistic conditions from the options that lead to equational segregation at meiosis $I$ and correctly predict the resulting tetrad pattern.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is based on well-established, fundamental principles of meiosis. The roles of kinetochore orientation, cohesin, Shugoshin, and PP$2$A in controlling chromosome segregation are central concepts in modern genetics and cell biology. The use of ordered tetrad analysis is a classic and powerful tool for studying meiotic events.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The initial state (a diploid cell heterozygous for a centromere-linked marker) is clearly defined. The question asks for the outcome of specific, well-defined molecular perturbations. A unique, deducible outcome exists for each proposed scenario.\n- **Objectivity and Clarity:** The language is technical, precise, and unambiguous. Terms like \"reductional,\" \"equational,\" \"co-orientation,\" and \"Shugoshin\" have standard, accepted meanings in the field.\n- **Internal Consistency:** The problem is internally consistent. The assumptions (no recombination, normal M$II$ spindle) serve to isolate the specific effects of the proposed mutations in meiosis $I$, which is appropriate for a conceptual problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It presents a rigorous test of understanding the molecular control of meiotic divisions. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the two requirements for the reductional division of meiosis $I$ and how their failure leads to an equational division instead.\n\nA normal reductional division at anaphase $I$ requires:\n1.  **Retention of sister chromatid cohesion at centromeres:** This is accomplished by the Shugoshin-PP$2$A complex, which protects centromeric cohesin from cleavage by the enzyme separase. This ensures sister chromatids are not pulled apart and move as a single unit.\n2.  **Monopolar attachment of sister kinetochores:** Both sister kinetochores of a given replicated chromosome must attach to microtubules emanating from the *same* spindle pole. This is termed \"co-orientation.\" This ensures that the entire replicated chromosome (composed of two sister chromatids) is pulled towards one pole, while its homolog is pulled to the opposite pole.\n\nAn equational division, as normally occurs in meiosis $II$ or mitosis, requires the opposite conditions:\n1.  **Cleavage of centromeric cohesin:** The physical link between sister chromatids must be severed.\n2.  **Bipolar attachment of sister kinetochores:** The two sister kinetochores must attach to microtubules from *opposite* spindle poles. This is termed \"bi-orientation.\" This creates the tension necessary to pull the sister chromatids apart once cohesin is cleaved.\n\nEquational segregation at meiosis $I$ would therefore necessitate the simultaneous failure of the normal meiosis $I$ program, creating meiosis $II$-like conditions. Specifically, it requires both bi-orientation of sister kinetochores and the cleavage of centromeric cohesin at anaphase $I$.\n\nLet us analyze the initial cell state. After DNA replication (S phase), the diploid nucleus contains one homologous pair of chromosomes relevant to the problem. One replicated chromosome carries two chromatids with the $A$ allele. The other replicated chromosome carries two chromatids with the $a$ allele. They pair to form a bivalent.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Loss of sister kinetochore co-orientation at meiosis I due to failure of the meiosis I-specific co-orientation machinery (for example, loss of monopolin function), with centromeric cohesin still protected by Shugoshin-PP2A. Predicted ordered tetrads at $A/a$: $100\\%$ second-division segregation ($A\\,a\\,A\\,a$ or $a\\,A\\,a\\,A$).**\n\n- **Analysis:** In this scenario, sister kinetochores fail to co-orient and instead adopt a bi-orientation, attaching to opposite spindle poles. However, the problem explicitly states that centromeric cohesin is still protected by Sgo-PP$2$A. At anaphase $I$, separase is activated but cannot cleave the centromeric cohesin that holds sister chromatids together. The spindle will attempt to pull the sister chromatids apart due to bi-orientation, but they are physically linked. This creates a mechanical conflict. The homologous chromosomes are also linked by chiasmata. The entire bivalent is pulled towards both poles, leading to a failure of segregation, or chromosome breakage, or random non-disjunction of the entire bivalent. It does *not* result in a clean equational division where sister chromatids separate. Separation of sister chromatids is a prerequisite for equational segregation, and this is prevented by the protected cohesin.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The mechanistic premise does not lead to the predicted outcome.\n\n**B. Concurrent failure of sister kinetochore co-orientation at meiosis I and failure of centromeric cohesin protection at meiosis I (for example, loss of monopolin function together with loss of Shugoshin-PP2A protection so that centromeric cohesin is cleaved at anaphase I). Predicted ordered tetrads at $A/a$: $100\\%$ second-division segregation ($A\\,a\\,A\\,a$ or $a\\,A\\,a\\,A$), with reductional segregation deferred to meiosis II.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This scenario presents the exact conditions required for an equational division to occur at meiosis $I$.\n    1.  **Failure of co-orientation:** Sister kinetochores bi-orient, attaching to opposite poles. This establishes the pulling force for separation.\n    2.  **Failure of cohesin protection:** Without Sgo-PP$2$A, separase cleaves centromeric cohesin at anaphase $I$.\nWith both conditions met, the sister chromatids of the $A$-chromosome separate, and the sister chromatids of the $a$-chromosome separate. One spindle pole will receive one $A$ chromatid and one $a$ chromatid; the other pole will receive the other $A$ chromatid and the other $a$ chromatid. This is, by definition, an equational division at meiosis $I$.\nThe two resulting secondary meiocytes are genetically identical, each containing one chromosome with allele $A$ and one with allele $a$. In meiosis $II$, these two non-sister chromosomes will segregate from each other (this is effectively the reductional division). Each secondary meiocyte will produce one spore with $A$ and one with $a$. The final ordered tetrad would thus have the pattern $A\\,a\\,A\\,a$ (or $a\\,A\\,a\\,A$), which is a second-division segregation pattern. The description \"reductional segregation deferred to meiosis II\" is accurate.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. The mechanistic conditions are necessary and sufficient for equational segregation at meiosis $I$, and the predicted tetrad pattern is the correct consequence.\n\n**C. Loss of centromeric cohesin protection at meiosis I (for example, loss of Shugoshin-PP2A protection), while sister kinetochore co-orientation remains intact. Predicted ordered tetrads at $A/a$: $100\\%$ second-division segregation ($A\\,a\\,A\\,a$ or $a\\,A\\,a\\,A$).**\n\n- **Analysis:** In this scenario, the sister kinetochores correctly co-orient. Both kinetochores of the $A/A$ chromosome attach to one pole, and both kinetochores of the $a/a$ chromosome attach to the other pole. At anaphase $I$, all cohesin is cleaved. However, because both sister chromatids of a given homolog are being pulled towards the *same* pole, there is no counteracting force to pull them apart. Both $A$ chromatids will move to one pole, and both $a$ chromatids will move to the other. The segregation is still reductional. The only difference is that the resulting secondary meiocytes receive two individual chromatids instead of one replicated chromosome. These two identical chromatids would then segregate to produce two identical spores in meiosis $II$. The final pattern is $A\\,A\\,a\\,a$, a first-division segregation pattern. Equational segregation did not occur at meiosis $I$.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The mechanistic premise leads to a reductional, not equational, division at meiosis $I$.\n\n**D. Loss of programmed recombination and chiasma formation (for example, absence of Spo11-dependent double-strand breaks), while sister kinetochore co-orientation and centromeric cohesin protection are intact. Predicted ordered tetrads at $A/a$: $100\\%$ second-division segregation ($A\\,a\\,A\\,a$ or $a\\,A\\,a\\,A$).**\n\n- **Analysis:** Without chiasmata to link homologous chromosomes, they exist as univalents at metaphase $I$. The core machinery for segregation (co-orientation and cohesin protection) is intact. Each univalent's sister kinetochores are co-oriented and will attach to a single pole. However, there is no tension from a partner homolog to ensure the two univalents attach to opposite poles. Their attachment to poles is random. There is a $50\\%$ chance they attach to opposite poles (leading to a reductional division and a first-division segregation pattern $A\\,A\\,a\\,a$) and a $50\\%$ chance they attach to the same pole (leading to non-disjunction, where one secondary meiocyte gets both univalents and the other gets none). In no case do sister chromatids separate at meiosis $I$, because centromeric cohesin is protected. Therefore, equational segregation does not occur at meiosis $I$. The outcome is a mix of first-division segregation and non-disjunction, not $100\\%$ second-division segregation.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The premise leads to random segregation of univalents, not equational division.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2830010"}, {"introduction": "Key transitions in the cell cycle, such as anaphase onset, must be both decisive and irreversible to ensure genomic stability.

It requires the derivation of a posterior odds based on a specified genetic model. We will proceed by first determining the composition of spores resulting from each type of nondisjunction, then deriving the probability distributions for the number of viable spores, and finally applying Bayes' rule.\n\nLet us begin with the first task: deriving the distribution of viable spores for a meiosis I (MI) nondisjunction.\nA diploid cell starts with a pair of homologous chromosomes. After DNA replication, the cell contains two pairs of sister chromatids, for a total of $4$ chromatids.\nIn MI nondisjunction, the two homologous chromosomes (each comprising two sister chromatids) fail to separate at anaphase I and move to the same pole. The other pole receives no copies of this chromosome.\nThe secondary meiocyte that received both homologous chromosomes proceeds to meiosis II, where sister chromatids separate normally. This division produces two spores, each containing two non-homologous copies of the chromosome, making them disomic ($n+1$).\nThe other secondary meiocyte, which received no chromosome, also divides. This produces two spores that are nullisomic ($n-1$) for the focal chromosome.\nThus, an MI nondisjunction event results in a tetrad containing $2$ disomic spores and $2$ nullisomic spores.\n\nAccording to the problem statement:\n- Nullisomic spores are inviable with probability $1$. They contribute $0$ to the count of viable spores.\n- Disomic spores are viable with probability $q$ each, independently.\n\nLet $k$ be the number of viable spores in the tetrad. The $2$ nullisomic spores are never viable. The number of viable spores is determined solely by the outcome of the $2$ disomic spores. This follows a binomial distribution with $n=2$ trials and probability of success (viability) $p=q$. The probability mass function for the number of viable spores, conditional on MI nondisjunction, $P(k|\\text{MI})$, is:\n- For $k=0$: Both disomic spores are inviable. $P(k=0|\\text{MI}) = \\binom{2}{0}q^{0}(1-q)^{2} = (1-q)^2$.\n- For $k=1$: One disomic spore is viable, the other is inviable. $P(k=1|\\text{MI}) = \\binom{2}{1}q^{1}(1-q)^{1} = 2q(1-q)$.\n- For $k=2$: Both disomic spores are viable. $P(k=2|\\text{MI}) = \\binom{2}{2}q^{2}(1-q)^{0} = q^2$.\n- For $k>2$: This is not possible as there are only $2$ potentially viable spores. $P(k=3|\\text{MI}) = 0$ and $P(k=4|\\text{MI}) = 0$.\n\nNext, we address the second task: deriving the distribution of viable spores for a meiosis II (MII) nondisjunction.\nIn this case, meiosis I proceeds normally. The two homologous chromosomes segregate to opposite poles. This produces two secondary meiocytes, each containing one replicated chromosome (i.e., a pair of sister chromatids).\nMeiosis II then occurs. One of the secondary meiocytes divides normally, separating its sister chromatids to produce two euploid ($n$) spores.\nThe other secondary meiocyte experiences a nondisjunction event, where the two sister chromatids fail to separate and move to the same pole. This division produces one disomic ($n+1$) spore and one nullisomic ($n-1$) spore.\nThus, an MII nondisjunction event results in a tetrad containing $2$ euploid spores, $1$ disomic spore, and $1$ nullisomic spore.\n\nAccording to the problem statement:\n- Euploid spores are viable with probability $1$.\n- Nullisomic spores are inviable with probability $1$.\n- Disomic spores are viable with probability $q$.\n\nLet $k$ be the number of viable spores. The $2$ euploid spores are always viable, contributing $2$ to the count. The $1$ nullisomic spore is never viable, contributing $0$. The total number of viable spores $k$ is therefore $2$ plus the number of viable spores from the single disomic spore.\n- If the disomic spore is inviable (with probability $1-q$), the total number of viable spores is $k=2+0=2$.\n- If the disomic spore is viable (with probability $q$), the total number of viable spores is $k=2+1=3$.\n\nThe probability mass function for the number of viable spores, conditional on MII nondisjunction, $P(k|\\text{MII})$, is:\n- For $k=2$: This occurs when the disomic spore is inviable. $P(k=2|\\text{MII}) = 1-q$.\n- For $k=3$: This occurs when the disomic spore is viable. $P(k=3|\\text{MII}) = q$.\n- For other values of $k$: $P(k \\notin \\{2,3\\}|\\text{MII}) = 0$.\n\nFinally, we perform the third task: derive the posterior odds that a tetrad with exactly $k=2$ viable spores arose from MI rather than MII nondisjunction. The posterior odds are defined as $\\frac{P(\\text{MI}|k=2)}{P(\\text{MII}|k=2)}$.\nUsing Bayes' rule, the posterior probability of an event (e.g., MI) given an observation (e.g., $k=2$) is $P(\\text{MI}|k=2) = \\frac{P(k=2|\\text{MI})P(\\text{MI})}{P(k=2)}$.\nThe ratio of posterior probabilities is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{P(\\text{MI}|k=2)}{P(\\text{MII}|k=2)} = \\frac{\\frac{P(k=2|\\text{MI})P(\\text{MI})}{P(k=2)}}{\\frac{P(k=2|\\text{MII})P(\\text{MII})}{P(k=2)}} $$\nThe term for the marginal probability of the data, $P(k=2)$, cancels out, yielding the a posteriori odds as the product of the prior odds and the Bayes factor (or likelihood ratio):\n$$ \\frac{P(\\text{MI}|k=2)}{P(\\text{MII}|k=2)} = \\left(\\frac{P(\\text{MI})}{P(\\text{MII})}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{P(k=2|\\text{MI})}{P(k=2|\\text{MII})}\\right) $$\nThe problem provides the prior odds as $\\Omega = \\frac{P(\\text{MI})}{P(\\text{MII})}$.\nFrom our derivations above, we have the likelihoods for the observation $k=2$:\n- $P(k=2|\\text{MI}) = q^2$\n- $P(k=2|\\text{MII}) = 1-q$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the posterior odds formula gives:\n$$ \\frac{P(\\text{MI}|k=2)}{P(\\text{MII}|k=2)} = \\Omega \\times \\frac{q^2}{1-q} $$\nThis expression is the final closed-form solution for the posterior odds in terms of the given parameters $\\Omega$ and $q$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\Omega \\frac{q^2}{1-q}} $$", "id": "2830089"}]}
