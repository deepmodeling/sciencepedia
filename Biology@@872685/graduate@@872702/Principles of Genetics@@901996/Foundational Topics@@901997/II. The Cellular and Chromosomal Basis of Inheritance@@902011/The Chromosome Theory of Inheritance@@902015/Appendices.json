This practice challenges you to determine the linear order of three genes and to quantify the phenomenon of chromosomal interference.

Under the chromosome theory of inheritance, crossing over during meiosis can generate recombination between linked loci, and in a testcross the genotype of each progeny reflects the haplotype of the gamete contributed by the heterozygous parent. Eight phenotypic classes corresponding to the eight possible gamete haplotypes are observed in the progeny. The observed counts are:\n- $ABC$: $806$\n- $abc$: $806$\n- $Abc$: $114$\n- $aBC$: $114$\n- $ABc$: $74$\n- $abC$: $74$\n- $AbC$: $6$\n- $aBc$: $6$\n\nLet $N$ denote the total progeny, and let $r_{XY}$ denote the recombination fraction between loci $X$ and $Y$.

Also, as the null model for interference, assume that crossover occurrence in adjacent intervals is independent when interference is absent.\n\nUsing only these core definitions and assumptions, do the following:\n- From first principles, derive explicit expressions for the estimators of the three pairwise recombination fractions $r_{AB}$, $r_{BC}$, and $r_{AC}$ in terms of the eight observed class counts, carefully accounting for how single and double crossovers contribute to each pairwise recombination fraction. Then state the corresponding map distance estimators in centimorgans derived from these recombination fraction estimators.\n- From first principles, derive an explicit expression for the coefficient of coincidence $c$ as a function of the observed double-crossover count, the total $N$, and the recombination fraction estimators for the two adjacent intervals. Then define the interference $I$ as a function of $c$.\n\nFinally, evaluate the interference $I$ numerically for the dataset above. Round your final $I$ value to four significant figures and express it as a pure decimal (no percent sign). No other numerical results are required in the final answer.", "solution": "The foundation of solving this problem is the classification of progeny based on the meiotic events that produced the gametes from the heterozygous parent. The parental haplotypes are $A B C$ and $a b c$.\n\nFirst, we determine the gene order. The parental classes are the most numerous: $ABC$ ($806$) and $abc$ ($806$). The double-crossover (DCO) classes are the least numerous: $AbC$ ($6$) and $aBc$ ($6$). By comparing a parental haplotype (e.g., $A B C$) with a double-crossover haplotype (e.g., $A b C$), the locus that is different ($B/b$) is identified as the middle gene. Thus, the gene order is $A-B-C$.\n\nWith the gene order established, we can categorize the progeny classes according to the crossover events in the two intervals, region I ($A-B$) and region II ($B-C$).\n- Parental (Non-crossover, NCO): Gametes that experienced no crossovers in the region. Haplotypes are $A B C$ and $a b c$. The total count is $n_{NCO} = n_{ABC} + n_{abc} = 806 + 806 = 1612$.\n- Single Crossover in Region I (SCO-I): Gametes from a crossover between $A$ and $B$. Haplotypes are $A b c$ and $a B C$. The total count is $n_{SCO-I} = n_{Abc} + n_{aBC} = 114 + 114 = 228$.\n- Single Crossover in Region II (SCO-II): Gametes from a crossover between $B$ and $C$. Haplotypes are $A B c$ and $a b C$. The total count is $n_{SCO-II} = n_{ABc} + n_{abC} = 74 + 74 = 148$.\n- Double Crossover (DCO): Gametes from simultaneous crossovers in region I and region II. Haplotypes are $A b C$ and $a B c$. The total count is $n_{DCO} = n_{AbC} + n_{aBc} = 6 + 6 = 12$.\n\nThe total number of progeny is $N$.\n$$N = n_{NCO} + n_{SCO-I} + n_{SCO-II} + n_{DCO} = 1612 + 228 + 148 + 12 = 2000$$\n\nNow, we derive the estimators for the recombination fractions. The recombination fraction, $r_{XY}$, between two loci $X$ and $Y$ is the proportion of progeny that show a recombinant combination of alleles for these loci. This is equivalent to the frequency of gametes resulting from an odd number of crossovers between $X$ and $Y$. For linked genes, this is estimated by counting all progeny that resulted from a crossover event between the loci.\n\nThe estimator for the recombination fraction between $A$ and $B$, $\\hat{r}_{AB}$, includes progeny from single crossovers in region I and double crossovers, as both events generate recombination between $A$ and $B$.\n$$ \\hat{r}_{AB} = \\frac{n_{SCO-I} + n_{DCO}}{N} = \\frac{(n_{Abc} + n_{aBC}) + (n_{AbC} + n_{aBc})}{N} $$\nThe map distance estimator, $\\hat{d}_{AB}$, is given by the problem's definition:\n$$ \\hat{d}_{AB} (\\text{cM}) = 100 \\times \\hat{r}_{AB} = 100 \\times \\frac{(n_{Abc} + n_{aBC}) + (n_{AbC} + n_{aBc})}{N} $$\n\nThe estimator for the recombination fraction between $B$ and $C$, $\\hat{r}_{BC}$, includes progeny from single crossovers in region II and double crossovers.\n$$ \\hat{r}_{BC} = \\frac{n_{SCO-II} + n_{DCO}}{N} = \\frac{(n_{ABc} + n_{abC}) + (n_{AbC} + n_{aBc})}{N} $$\nThe map distance estimator, $\\hat{d}_{BC}$, is:\n$$ \\hat{d}_{BC} (\\text{cM}) = 100 \\times \\hat{r}_{BC} = 100 \\times \\frac{(n_{ABc} + n_{abC}) + (n_{AbC} + n_{aBc})}{N} $$\n\nThe estimator for the recombination fraction between the flanking markers $A$ and $C$, $\\hat{r}_{AC}$, includes only progeny that have a recombinant combination of alleles for $A$ and $C$. Single crossover events (in either region I or II) produce such progeny. Double crossover events, however, restore the parental linkage of alleles for the flanking markers ($A$ and $C$ in $AbC$; $a$ and $c$ in $aBc$). Therefore, DCO progeny are non-recombinant with respect to loci $A$ and $C$.\n$$ \\hat{r}_{AC} = \\frac{n_{SCO-I} + n_{SCO-II}}{N} = \\frac{(n_{Abc} + n_{aBC}) + (n_{ABc} + n_{abC})}{N} $$\nThe map distance estimator, $\\hat{d}_{AC}$, is:\n$$ \\hat{d}_{AC} (\\text{cM}) = 100 \\times \\hat{r}_{AC} = 100 \\times \\frac{(n_{Abc} + n_{aBC}) + (n_{ABc} + n_{abC})}{N} $$\nIt must be noted that this distance estimator $\\hat{d}_{AC}$ based on the recombination fraction $\\hat{r}_{AC}$ underestimates the true map distance, because it fails to account for the two crossover events in the DCO class. A more accurate measure of map distance between flanking markers is the sum of the map distances of the intervening segments, $\\hat{d}_{AB} + \\hat{d}_{BC}$.\n\nNext, we derive the expressions for the coefficient of coincidence, $c$, and interference, $I$.\nThe coefficient of coincidence $c$ is the ratio of the observed frequency of double crossovers to the expected frequency of double crossovers.\nThe observed DCO frequency is:\n$$ f_{DCO, obs} = \\frac{n_{DCO}}{N} = \\frac{n_{AbC} + n_{aBc}}{N} $$\nThe expected DCO frequency, under the null model of no interference (independent crossovers in adjacent intervals), is the product of the recombination frequencies in the two adjacent intervals.\n$$ f_{DCO, exp} = \\hat{r}_{AB} \\times \\hat{r}_{BC} $$\nThus, the coefficient of coincidence $c$ is:\n$$ c = \\frac{f_{DCO, obs}}{f_{DCO, exp}} = \\frac{(n_{AbC} + n_{aBc}) / N}{\\hat{r}_{AB} \\times \\hat{r}_{BC}} = \\frac{N(n_{AbC} + n_{aBc})}{((n_{Abc} + n_{aBC}) + (n_{AbC} + n_{aBc}))((n_{ABc} + n_{abC}) + (n_{AbC} + n_{aBc}))} $$\nInterference, $I$, measures the degree to which a crossover in one region affects the probability of a crossover in an adjacent region. It is defined as:\n$$ I = 1 - c $$\n\nFinally, we evaluate $I$ numerically using the provided data.\nFirst, we compute the recombination fraction estimators:\n$$ \\hat{r}_{AB} = \\frac{228 + 12}{2000} = \\frac{240}{2000} = 0.12 $$\n$$ \\hat{r}_{BC} = \\frac{148 + 12}{2000} = \\frac{160}{2000} = 0.08 $$\nNext, we compute the observed and expected DCO frequencies:\n$$ f_{DCO, obs} = \\frac{12}{2000} = 0.006 $$\n$$ f_{DCO, exp} = \\hat{r}_{AB} \\times \\hat{r}_{BC} = 0.12 \\times 0.08 = 0.0096 $$\nNow, we calculate the coefficient of coincidence $c$:\n$$ c = \\frac{f_{DCO, obs}}{f_{DCO, exp}} = \\frac{0.006}{0.0096} = \\frac{60}{96} = \\frac{5}{8} = 0.625 $$\nThe interference $I$ is then:\n$$ I = 1 - c = 1 - 0.625 = 0.375 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ I = 0.3750 $$\nThis positive value of interference indicates that a crossover in one region reduces the likelihood of a crossover occurring in the adjacent region.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3750}$$", "id": "2856343"}, {"introduction": "A crucial line of evidence supporting the chromosome theory came from observing traits whose inheritance patterns were tied to the sex of the organism. This practice moves beyond simple mapping to explore the distinct mathematical consequences of a gene's location on a sex chromosome. You will derive the expected phenotypic ratios for an X-linked recessive trait from first principles, contrasting them with the predictions for an equivalent autosomal trait to illuminate precisely how the segregation of the X and Y chromosomes governs the expression of the phenotype.

The parental genotypes are a carrier female, $X^{A}X^{a}$, and a phenotypically normal male, $X^{A}Y$. The production of offspring is governed by meiotic segregation and sex determination.\n\nThe female parent ($X^{A}X^{a}$) produces two types of gametes, $X^{A}$ and $X^{a}$, each with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$, according to Mendel's law of segregation. The male parent ($X^{A}Y$) produces two types of gametes, $X^{A}$ and $Y$.\n\nThe problem states that the probability of any given birth being male is $r$, where $r \\in (0,1)$, and consequently, the probability of a birth being female is $1-r$. The genotype of the offspring depends on both the sex and the random combination of parental gametes.\n\nLet us determine the probabilities of the four possible offspring genotypes:\n1.  A female offspring ($X^{A}X^{A}$) results from the fertilization of an $X^{A}$ egg by an $X^{A}$ sperm. The paternal $X^{A}$ gamete determines the female sex. Given the offspring is female (probability $1-r$), the mother contributes an $X^{A}$ allele with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $P(X^{A}X^{A}) = P(\\text{female}) \\times P(\\text{maternal } X^{A}) = (1-r) \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1-r}{2}$.\n2.  A carrier female offspring ($X^{A}X^{a}$) results from the fertilization of an $X^{a}$ egg by an $X^{A}$ sperm. Similarly, $P(X^{A}X^{a}) = P(\\text{female}) \\times P(\\text{maternal } X^{a}) = (1-r) \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1-r}{2}$.\n3.  A normal male offspring ($X^{A}Y$) results from the fertilization of an $X^{A}$ egg by a $Y$ sperm. The paternal $Y$ gamete determines the male sex. Given the offspring is male (probability $r$), the mother contributes an $X^{A}$ allele with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $P(X^{A}Y) = P(\\text{male}) \\times P(\\text{maternal } X^{A}) = r \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{r}{2}$.\n4.  A hemizygous recessive male offspring ($X^{a}Y$) results from the fertilization of an $X^{a}$ egg by a $Y$ sperm. Similarly, $P(X^{a}Y) = P(\\text{male}) \\times P(\\text{maternal } X^{a}) = r \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{r}{2}$.\n\nThe sum of these probabilities is $\\frac{1-r}{2} + \\frac{1-r}{2} + \\frac{r}{2} + \\frac{r}{2} = 1$, as required.\n\nNext, we determine the sex-specific phenotype ratios for this X-linked cross.\nFor female offspring: The possible genotypes are $X^{A}X^{A}$ and $X^{A}X^{a}$. Due to complete dominance of allele $A$, both genotypes result in a phenotypically normal individual. Therefore, $100\\%$ of female offspring are phenotypically normal. The ratio of normal to affected females is $1 : 0$.\n\nFor male offspring: The possible genotypes are $X^{A}Y$ and $X^{a}Y$, occurring in equal frequency among males. The $X^{A}Y$ genotype is phenotypically normal. The $X^{a}Y$ genotype leads to the recessive phenotype, but its expression is subject to a penetrance factor $\\pi_{m} \\in [0,1]$.\nThe fraction of males that are phenotypically affected is the fraction with genotype $X^{a}Y$ multiplied by the penetrance: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\pi_{m} = \\frac{\\pi_{m}}{2}$.\nThe fraction of males that are phenotypically normal consists of those with genotype $X^{A}Y$ (fraction $\\frac{1}{2}$) and non-penetrant individuals with genotype $X^{a}Y$ (fraction $\\frac{1}{2}(1-\\pi_{m})$). The total fraction of normal males is $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\pi_{m}) = 1 - \\frac{\\pi_{m}}{2}$.\nThe ratio of normal to affected males is $(1 - \\frac{\\pi_{m}}{2}) : \\frac{\\pi_{m}}{2}$.\n\nNow, we construct the analogous autosomal recessive scenario. The cross is between a heterozygous individual, $Aa$, and a homozygous dominant individual, $AA$.\nThe $Aa$ parent produces gametes $A$ and $a$, each with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. The $AA$ parent produces only gamete $A$.\nThe possible offspring genotypes are:\n1.  Homozygous dominant ($AA$), from an $A$ gamete from the $Aa$ parent. $P(AA) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n2.  Heterozygous ($Aa$), from an $a$ gamete from the $Aa$ parent. $P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince allele $A$ is dominant, both genotypes $AA$ and $Aa$ result in a phenotypically normal individual. Therefore, $100\\%$ of offspring are phenotypically normal, regardless of sex. The ratio of normal to affected is $1:0$ for both males and females.\n\nQualitatively, the sex-specific phenotype expectations differ fundamentally between the two scenarios. In the X-linked case, the inheritance of the trait is coupled to the inheritance of the sex-determining X-chromosome. A son receives his only X-chromosome from his mother. If the mother is a carrier ($X^{A}X^{a}$), her son has a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability of inheriting the recessive allele $a$ and thus being affected (modulated by penetrance). A daughter, however, receives an X-chromosome from both parents. Since the father is $X^{A}Y$, all daughters must inherit the $X^{A}$ chromosome from him, guaranteeing they receive at least one dominant allele and are therefore phenotypically normal. This mechanism restricts the expression of the trait to males in this specific cross.\nIn the autosomal case, the gene is not on a sex chromosome, so its inheritance is independent of sex. Both parents contribute alleles to offspring of both sexes equally. In the given $Aa \\times AA$ cross, all offspring inherit a dominant $A$ allele from the $AA$ parent, making it impossible to produce a recessively affected ($aa$) individual. Consequently, there is no possibility of observing the trait, and the phenotype distribution is identical ($100\\%$ normal) for both sexes.\n\nFinally, we derive the expression for the difference in the expected overall fraction of affected offspring between the X-linked and autosomal scenarios.\nLet $P_{aff,X}$ be the overall probability of an offspring being affected in the X-linked scenario. An offspring can only be affected if it is male and has the penetrant genotype $X^{a}Y$.\n$P_{aff,X} = P(X^{a}Y) \\times \\pi_{m}$\nFrom our earlier calculation, $P(X^{a}Y) = \\frac{r}{2}$.\nTherefore, $P_{aff,X} = \\frac{r}{2} \\times \\pi_{m} = \\frac{r \\pi_{m}}{2}$.\n\nLet $P_{aff,A}$ be the overall probability of an offspring being affected in the autosomal scenario. As established, the cross $Aa \\times AA$ cannot produce an affected ($aa$) offspring.\nTherefore, $P_{aff,A} = 0$.\n\nThe difference in the expected overall fraction of affected offspring, $\\Delta P_{aff}$, is:\n$$ \\Delta P_{aff} = P_{aff,X} - P_{aff,A} = \\frac{r \\pi_{m}}{2} - 0 $$\n$$ \\Delta P_{aff} = \\frac{r \\pi_{m}}{2} $$\nThis expression represents the excess probability of observing an affected individual in the X-linked cross compared to the analogous autosomal cross, as a function of the male birth probability $r$ and the male penetrance $\\pi_{m}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{r \\pi_{m}}{2}} $$", "id": "2856399"}]}
