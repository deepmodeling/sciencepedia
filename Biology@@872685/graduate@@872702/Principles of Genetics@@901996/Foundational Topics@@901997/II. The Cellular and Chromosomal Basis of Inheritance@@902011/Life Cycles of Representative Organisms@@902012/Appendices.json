It is a sound, well-posed question grounded in established scientific and mathematical principles. The solution will proceed.\n\n**Derivation of Time-Averaged Ploidy, $\\bar{\\pi}$**\n\nThe instantaneous ploidy, $\\pi(t)$, over one complete life cycle of duration $T = T_h + T_d$ is defined as a piecewise function based on the problem statement:\n$$\n\\pi(t) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{for } 0 \\le t < T_h \\\\\n2 & \\text{for } T_h \\le t < T_h + T_d\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe time-averaged ploidy, $\\bar{\\pi}$, is calculated using the provided definition:\n$$\n\\bar{\\pi} \\equiv \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} \\pi(t)\\, dt\n$$\nSubstituting $T = T_h + T_d$, the expression becomes:\n$$\n\\bar{\\pi} = \\frac{1}{T_h + T_d}\\int_{0}^{T_h + T_d} \\pi(t)\\, dt\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral of the piecewise function $\\pi(t)$, we must split the integral into two parts corresponding to the haploid and diploid phases:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T_h + T_d} \\pi(t)\\, dt = \\int_{0}^{T_h} \\pi(t)\\, dt + \\int_{T_h}^{T_h + T_d} \\pi(t)\\, dt\n$$\nWe now substitute the constant value of $\\pi(t)$ for each interval:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T_h + T_d} \\pi(t)\\, dt = \\int_{0}^{T_h} 1\\, dt + \\int_{T_h}^{T_h + T_d} 2\\, dt\n$$\nEvaluating these elementary integrals gives:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T_h} 1\\, dt = [t]_{0}^{T_h} = T_h - 0 = T_h\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{T_h}^{T_h + T_d} 2\\, dt = [2t]_{T_h}^{T_h + T_d} = 2(T_h + T_d) - 2(T_h) = 2T_h + 2T_d - 2T_h = 2T_d\n$$\nThe total value of the integral over one life cycle is the sum of these two results:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T_h + T_d} \\pi(t)\\, dt = T_h + 2T_d\n$$\nFinally, to find the time-averaged ploidy $\\bar{\\pi}$, we divide this sum by the total duration of the life cycle, $T = T_h + T_d$:\n$$\n\\bar{\\pi} = \\frac{T_h + 2T_d}{T_h + T_d}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form, simplified analytic expression for $\\bar{\\pi}$ in terms of $T_h$ and $T_d$.\n\n**Justification of Relationship to Allelic Exposure**\n\nThe exposure of a completely recessive allele to natural selection depends on its phenotypic expression.\n- In the haploid phase (duration $T_h$), all alleles are expressed, as there is no second chromosome set to provide a dominant allele. Thus, a recessive allele is *always* exposed to selection during this phase.\n- In the diploid phase (duration $T_d$), a recessive allele is phenotypically masked in a heterozygous state. It is only exposed to selection if the individual is homozygous recessive. The problem specifies that we assume allele frequencies are low, making homozygous individuals rare. Therefore, the exposure of a recessive allele to selection during the diploid phase is negligible.\n\nThe total exposure to selection for a recessive allele across the life cycle is, under these assumptions, effectively proportional to the fraction of time spent in the haploid phase. Let this fraction be $f_h = \\frac{T_h}{T_h + T_d}$.\n\nWe can express $\\bar{\\pi}$ in terms of $f_h$. The fraction of time spent in the diploid phase is $f_d = \\frac{T_d}{T_h + T_d} = 1 - f_h$.\nThe expression for $\\bar{\\pi}$ is the weighted average of the ploidy levels:\n$$\n\\bar{\\pi} = \\frac{T_h}{T_h + T_d} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{T_d}{T_h + T_d} \\cdot 2 = f_h \\cdot 1 + f_d \\cdot 2\n$$\nSubstituting $f_d = 1 - f_h$:\n$$\n\\bar{\\pi} = f_h + 2(1 - f_h) = f_h + 2 - 2f_h = 2 - f_h\n$$\nRearranging for $f_h$ gives:\n$$\nf_h = 2 - \\bar{\\pi}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates a direct, inverse linear relationship between the time-averaged ploidy $\\bar{\\pi}$ and the fraction of the life cycle $f_h$ during which recessive alleles are exposed to selection. A lower value of $\\bar{\\pi}$ (approaching $1$) corresponds to a larger haploid fraction of the life cycle ($f_h$ approaching $1$), maximizing the exposure of recessive alleles to selection. Conversely, a higher value of $\\bar{\\pi}$ (approaching $2$) implies a dominant diploid phase ($f_h$ approaching $0$), which \"shelters\" recessive alleles from selection for most of the life cycle. The quantity $2 - \\bar{\\pi}$ is a direct measure of this selective exposure under the given assumptions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{T_h + 2T_d}{T_h + T_d}}$$", "id": "2825628"}, {"introduction": "Meiosis is the cornerstone of most sexual life cycles, shuffling genetic material through recombination to generate novel combinations of alleles. Model organisms like the budding yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, whose life cycle allows for the recovery of all four meiotic products in a \"tetrad,\" offer a powerful, high-resolution window into this process. This practice challenges you to translate raw tetrad data into fundamental genetic parameters like recombination frequency and crossover interference, building a core skill in the analysis of meiotic outcomes [@problem_id:2825657].", "problem": "A haploid-diploid life cycle underlies tetrad genetics in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: two haploid parents mate to form a transient diploid zygote, which undergoes a single meiosis, producing one ascus (tetrad) containing four haploid spores.

Marker $B$ is suspected to lie between $A$ and $C$. You genotype all four spores from each ascus, and you classify each tetrad as unordered for each pair of markers into Parental Ditype (PD), Tetratype (T), or Nonparental Ditype (NPD).

Interference is defined in relation to the coefficient of coincidence, $C$, by the equation:\n$$\nI = 1 - C\n$$\nThe coefficient of coincidence, $C$, is the ratio of the observed frequency of double crossover (DCO) events to the expected frequency of DCO events. The expected frequency is calculated under the assumption of no interference, i.e., that crossovers in adjacent intervals occur independently.\n$$\nC = \\frac{\\text{Observed Frequency of DCO}}{\\text{Expected Frequency of DCO}}\n$$\nTo calculate $C$, we must first determine the recombination frequencies for the two intervals, $A$–$B$ and $B$–$C$, and then determine the observed and expected frequencies of double crossovers. All frequencies will be calculated at the level of individual chromatids (spores), as this is the most fundamental level.\n\nFirst, we calculate the recombination frequency ($RF$) for each interval using the provided tetrad data. The recombination frequency is the proportion of recombinant chromatids among the total population of chromatids. In a total of $N$ tetrads, there are $4N$ chromatids. For a given pair of markers, a Tetratype (T) tetrad contains $2$ recombinant and $2$ parental chromatids. A Nonparental Ditype (NPD) tetrad contains $4$ recombinant chromatids. A Parental Ditype (PD) tetrad contains $0$ recombinant chromatids.\n\nThe total number of recombinant chromatids for an interval is therefore $2 \\times T + 4 \\times NPD$. The recombination frequency is this count divided by the total number of chromatids, $4N$.\n$$\nRF = \\frac{2 \\times T + 4 \\times NPD}{4 \\times N} = \\frac{T + 2 \\times NPD}{2 \\times N}\n$$\nThe total number of tetrads is $N = 250$.\n\nFor the interval $A$–$B$, the data are $T_{AB} = 90$ and $NPD_{AB} = 10$.

The recombination frequency, $RF_{BC}$, is:\n$$\nRF_{BC} = \\frac{100 + 2 \\times 10}{2 \\times 250} = \\frac{100 + 20}{500} = \\frac{120}{500} = 0.24\n$$\nThe expected frequency of double crossover chromatids is the product of the individual recombination frequencies, assuming independence:\n$$\n\\text{Expected Freq(DCO)} = RF_{AB} \\times RF_{BC} = 0.22 \\times 0.24 = 0.0528\n$$\nNext, we determine the observed frequency of double crossover chromatids. The problem provides this information directly: across all tetrads, a total of $D = 35$ spores were identified as double recombinant chromatids.

The language is objective and precise. The setup is self-contained and free of contradictions. The task is a standard derivation in theoretical population genetics.\n\nWe proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the segregation distortion, $D(k)$. This requires first finding the expected fraction of $K$ alleles, $p_K(k)$, in a large pool of surviving ascospores. By the law of large numbers, for a very large pool of asci, this fraction is equal to the ratio of the expected number of surviving $K$ spores per ascus to the expected total number of surviving spores per ascus.\n\nLet us consider a single ascus originating from a heterozygous $K/S$ diploid.\nInitially, before the spore-killing action, the ascus contains $N_{K, \\text{initial}} = 4$ spores of genotype $K$ and $N_{S, \\text{initial}} = 4$ spores of genotype $S$.\n\nThe spore-killing mechanism is post-meiotic.\nThe $K$-genotype spores are not affected by the drive mechanism. Therefore, the number of surviving $K$ spores in any ascus is always $4$. The expected number of surviving $K$ spores per ascus, denoted $E[N_{K, \\text{final}}]$, is thus:\n$$E[N_{K, \\text{final}}] = 4$$\n\nThe $S$-genotype spores are subject to killing. Each of the $4$ spores of genotype $S$ is killed with an independent probability $k$. Consequently, each $S$ spore survives with a probability of $1-k$.\nLet $X_i$ be the indicator random variable for the survival of the $i$-th $S$ spore, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n$$\nX_i = \n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if the } i\\text{-th } S \\text{ spore survives (with probability } 1-k\\text{)} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if the } i\\text{-th } S \\text{ spore is killed (with probability } k\\text{)}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe expected value of $X_i$ is $E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot (1-k) + 0 \\cdot k = 1-k$.\nThe total number of surviving $S$ spores, $N_{S, \\text{final}}$, is the sum of these indicator variables: $N_{S, \\text{final}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} X_i$.\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected number of surviving $S$ spores, $E[N_{S, \\text{final}}]$, is:\n$$E[N_{S, \\text{final}}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{4} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} E[X_i] = 4(1-k)$$\n\nThe expected total number of surviving spores per ascus, $E[N_{\\text{total}}]$, is the sum of the expected numbers of surviving $K$ and $S$ spores:\n$$E[N_{\\text{total}}] = E[N_{K, \\text{final}}] + E[N_{S, \\text{final}}] = 4 + 4(1-k) = 4 + 4 - 4k = 8 - 4k$$\nThis calculation is valid for $k \\in [0,1]$. If $k=1$, all $S$ spores are killed, and the number of surviving $S$ spores is $0$, leading to $E[N_{\\text{total}}] = 4$, which is consistent with the formula $8 - 4(1) = 4$. The denominator is only zero if $k=2$, which is outside the domain.\n\nThe expected fraction of $K$ spores, $p_K(k)$, is the ratio of the expected number of surviving $K$ spores to the expected total number of surviving spores:\n$$p_K(k) = \\frac{E[N_{K, \\text{final}}]}{E[N_{\\text{total}}]} = \\frac{4}{8 - 4k}$$\nThis expression can be simplified by factoring out $4$ from the denominator:\n$$p_K(k) = \\frac{4}{4(2 - k)} = \\frac{1}{2-k}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the segregation distortion, $D(k)$, using its definition:\n$$D(k) = p_K(k) - \\frac{1}{2}$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $p_K(k)$:\n$$D(k) = \\frac{1}{2-k} - \\frac{1}{2}$$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator, which is $2(2-k)$:\n$$D(k) = \\frac{2}{2(2-k)} - \\frac{2-k}{2(2-k)} = \\frac{2 - (2-k)}{2(2-k)} = \\frac{2 - 2 + k}{4 - 2k}$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the segregation distortion:\n$$D(k) = \\frac{k}{4 - 2k}$$\nFor $k=0$ (no drive), $D(0)=0$, correctly indicating no distortion from the Mendelian $1/2$ proportion.
