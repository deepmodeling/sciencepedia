The analysis is based on a small, three-generation family. The family structure and the phenotype (affected or unaffected) of each individual are described as follows:\n\nThe first generation consists of an affected male (designated I-1) and an unaffected female (I-2).\nThis couple has three children who form the second generation: an affected daughter (II-1), an unaffected son (II-2), and an affected son (II-3).\nThe affected daughter from the second generation (II-1) has a partnership with an unaffected male (II-4). Together, they have two children who form the third generation: an unaffected son (III-1) and an affected daughter (III-2).\n\nAssuming that no new mutations have occurred within this family, which of the following simple Mendelian inheritance patterns are consistent with the observed phenotypes in all three generations?\n\nA. Autosomal dominant only\n\nB. Autosomal recessive only\n\nC. Autosomal dominant and Autosomal recessive\n\nD. X-linked dominant and X-linked recessive\n\nE. Autosomal dominant and X-linked dominant\n\nF. Autosomal recessive and X-linked recessive\n\nG. All five modes (Autosomal dominant, Autosomal recessive, X-linked dominant, X-linked recessive, Y-linked) are possible.", "solution": "We assume a single gene with complete penetrance and no new mutations. We test each simple Mendelian mode against the pedigree using standard Mendelian transmission rules.\n\nAutosomal dominant (AD): Let the disease allele be $A$ (dominant) and the normal allele be $a$. An affected individual is $Aa$ or $AA$; an unaffected is $aa$. In generation I, I-1 is affected and I-2 is unaffected, so I-1 cannot be $AA$ because that would force all children to be affected, contradicting the unaffected son II-2. Therefore I-1 is $Aa$ and I-2 is $aa$. The cross $Aa \\times aa$ yields children $Aa$ (affected) or $aa$ (unaffected) in either sex, which is consistent with II-1 (affected daughter), II-2 (unaffected son), and II-3 (affected son). In generation II, II-1 is affected, hence $Aa$, and her partner II-4 is unaffected $aa$. The cross $Aa \\times aa$ yields both affected and unaffected children, matching III-1 (unaffected son) and III-2 (affected daughter). Thus AD is consistent.\n\nAutosomal recessive (AR): Let the disease allele be $a$ (recessive) and the normal allele be $A$. Affected individuals are $aa$; unaffected are $AA$ or $Aa$. In generation I, I-1 is affected $aa$. To have affected children in generation II, I-2 must carry $a$, so I-2 is $Aa$ (if $AA$, no affected children would occur, contradicting II-1 and II-3). The cross $aa \\times Aa$ yields children $aa$ (affected) or $Aa$ (unaffected), regardless of sex, which fits II-1 (affected daughter), II-2 (unaffected son), II-3 (affected son). In generation II, II-1 is $aa$ and II-4 is unaffected, so II-4 is $AA$ or $Aa$. Because an affected child III-2 exists, II-4 must be $Aa$. The cross $aa \\times Aa$ produces both $aa$ (affected) and $Aa$ (unaffected), consistent with III-1 (unaffected son) and III-2 (affected daughter). Thus AR is consistent.\n\nX-linked dominant (XLD): Let $X^{A}$ be the dominant disease allele and $X^{a}$ the normal allele. An affected male is $X^{A}Y$ and an unaffected female is $X^{a}X^{a}$ under complete penetrance. An affected male transmits $X^{A}$ to all daughters and $Y$ to all sons, so daughters are all affected and sons all unaffected from $X^{A}Y \\times X^{a}X^{a}$. In generation II, there is an affected son (II-3), which cannot occur in this cross without a new mutation, which is excluded. Also, the mother is unaffected, so she cannot be $X^{A}X^{a}$. Therefore XLD is inconsistent.\n\nX-linked recessive (XLR): Let $X^{a}$ be the recessive disease allele and $X^{A}$ the normal allele. I-1 is an affected male $X^{a}Y$. To have an affected daughter II-1, the mother I-2 must be a carrier $X^{A}X^{a}$. The cross $X^{a}Y \\times X^{A}X^{a}$ yields a mix of affected and unaffected sons and daughters, compatible with generation II. However, II-1 is then an affected female $X^{a}X^{a}$. With an unaffected male partner II-4 ($X^{A}Y$), the cross $X^{a}X^{a} \\times X^{A}Y$ produces all daughters $X^{A}X^{a}$ (unaffected carriers) and all sons $X^{a}Y$ (affected). The observed generation III has an unaffected son (III-1) and an affected daughter (III-2), contradicting these predictions. Therefore XLR is inconsistent.\n\nY-linked: Affected fathers transmit to all sons and no females are affected. The pedigree has affected females and an unaffected son of an affected father, so Y-linked is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only modes consistent with all observations are autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1507942"}, {"introduction": "Real-world pedigrees are often not perfectly clear-cut and can sometimes be explained by more than one genetic model.

The key individuals are in Generation I and II:\n- A man in Generation I has FTD. His father (the paternal grandfather) also had FTD and was genotyped as M2/M2 for the marker.
