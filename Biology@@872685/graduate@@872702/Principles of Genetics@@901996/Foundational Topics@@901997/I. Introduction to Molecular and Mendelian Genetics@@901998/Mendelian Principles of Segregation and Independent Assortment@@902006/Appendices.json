Task: Derive the theoretical population variance of $Y$ as a function of $\\Delta$ and $\\sigma^{2}$.\n\nSecond, I will validate the problem. The problem is scientifically grounded, as it employs fundamental concepts from Mendelian and quantitative genetics, specifically the law of segregation and the partitioning of phenotypic variance. The model $Y = \\mu_g + \\varepsilon$ is a standard and foundational model in quantitative genetics. The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary information and assumptions (e.g., a specific cross, a defined genetic model, statistical properties of environmental effects) to derive a unique analytical solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is not trivial, as it requires a correct application of probability theory and the law of total variance to partition the phenotypic variance into its genetic and environmental components. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nI shall now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is structured in two parts. The first part establishes the Mendelian basis of the cross, and the second part builds a quantitative model upon it.\n\nFor Part $1$, we consider the backcross $Aa \\times aa$. The parent with genotype $Aa$ is heterozygous and, according to Mendel's law of segregation under the assumption of no segregation distortion, produces two types of gametes, $A$ and $a$, in equal proportions. The probability of producing an $A$ gamete is $P(A) = 1/2$, and the probability of producing an $a$ gamete is $P(a) = 1/2$. The parent with genotype $aa$ is homozygous recessive and can only produce one type of gamete, $a$, with probability $P(a) = 1$.\n\nThe genotypes of the progeny are determined by the random union of these gametes. We can construct a Punnett square to visualize this:\n\n| Gamete from $Aa$ | Gamete from $aa$ | Progeny Genotype | Probability |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $A$ | $a$ | $Aa$ | $1/2 \\times 1 = 1/2$ |\n| $a$ | $a$ | $aa$ | $1/2 \\times 1 = 1/2$ |\n\nThus, the expected genotype distribution among the progeny is $1/2$ for $Aa$ and $1/2$ for $aa$. With the assumption of a very large progeny, these expected probabilities can be treated as the actual frequencies of the genotypes in the population. The genotypic segregation ratio is $1$ $Aa$ : $1$ $aa$.\n\nUnder complete dominance of $A$ over $a$ with complete penetrance, the genotype $Aa$ expresses the dominant phenotype (let us call this phenotype $[A]$), and the genotype $aa$ expresses the recessive phenotype (phenotype $[a]$). Therefore, the phenotypic classes are $[A]$ and $[a]$. The frequency of phenotype $[A]$ is equal to the frequency of genotype $Aa$, which is $1/2$. The frequency of phenotype $[a]$ is equal to the frequency of genotype $aa$, which is $1/2$. The expected phenotypic segregation ratio is therefore $1 [A] : 1 [a]$.\n\nFor Part 2, we are tasked with deriving the theoretical population variance of the trait $Y$, denoted as $Var(Y)$. The total variance of a variable that depends on another random variable can be decomposed using the law of total variance. In our context, the phenotype $Y$ depends on the genotype $G$. The law states:\n$$\nVar(Y) = E[Var(Y \\mid G)] + Var(E[Y \\mid G])\n$$\nHere, $G$ is a random variable representing the genotype, which can take values $aa$ or $Aa$ with probabilities derived in Part $1$. Specifically, $P(G=aa) = 1/2$ and $P(G=Aa) = 1/2$.\n\nLet us analyze each term separately.\n\nThe first term, $E[Var(Y \\mid G)]$, is the expected value of the conditional variance of $Y$ given the genotype $G$. This is the portion of the variance due to environmental effects, often called the environmental variance, $Var_E$.\nFor a specific genotype $g$, the phenotype is given by $Y \\mid g = \\mu_g + \\varepsilon$. The variance of $Y$ conditional on $g$ is:\n$$\nVar(Y \\mid g) = Var(\\mu_g + \\varepsilon \\mid g)\n$$\nSince $\\mu_g$ is a constant for a given genotype $g$, and $\\varepsilon$ is independent of genotype, this simplifies to:\n$$\nVar(Y \\mid g) = Var(\\varepsilon) = \\sigma^2\n$$\nThis conditional variance is $\\sigma^2$ for both genotypes, $g=aa$ and $g=Aa$. Therefore, the random variable $Var(Y \\mid G)$ is a constant, $\\sigma^2$. The expectation of a constant is the constant itself:\n$$\nE[Var(Y \\mid G)] = E[\\sigma^2] = \\sigma^2\n$$\n\nThe second term, $Var(E[Y \\mid G])$, is the variance of the conditional expectation of $Y$ given the genotype $G$. This is the portion of the variance due to genetic differences among individuals, often called the genetic variance, $Var_G$.\nFirst, we find the conditional expectation $E[Y \\mid g]$:\n$$\nE[Y \\mid g] = E[\\mu_g + \\varepsilon \\mid g] = E[\\mu_g \\mid g] + E[\\varepsilon \\mid g]\n$$\nSince $\\mu_g$ is a constant for a given $g$ and $\\varepsilon$ has a mean of $0$ and is independent of $g$, we get:\n$$\nE[Y \\mid g] = \\mu_g + 0 = \\mu_g\n$$\nSo, we need to find the variance of the random variable $M = E[Y \\mid G]$, which takes the value $\\mu_{aa}$ with probability $1/2$ and $\\mu_{Aa}$ with probability $1/2$.\nTo calculate $Var(M)$, we first find its mean, $E[M]$:\n$$\nE[M] = \\mu_{aa} \\cdot P(G=aa) + \\mu_{Aa} \\cdot P(G=Aa) = \\mu_{aa} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\mu_{Aa} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mu_{aa} + \\mu_{Aa})\n$$\nThe variance is given by $Var(M) = E[M^2] - (E[M])^2$. Let's compute $E[M^2]$:\n$$\nE[M^2] = (\\mu_{aa})^2 \\cdot P(G=aa) + (\\mu_{Aa})^2 \\cdot P(G=Aa) = (\\mu_{aa})^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + (\\mu_{Aa})^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}((\\mu_{aa})^2 + (\\mu_{Aa})^2)\n$$\nNow, we can compute the variance:\n$$\nVar(M) = \\frac{1}{2}((\\mu_{aa})^2 + (\\mu_{Aa})^2) - \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(\\mu_{aa} + \\mu_{Aa}) \\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nVar(M) = \\frac{1}{2}((\\mu_{aa})^2 + (\\mu_{Aa})^2) - \\frac{1}{4}((\\mu_{aa})^2 + 2\\mu_{aa}\\mu_{Aa} + (\\mu_{Aa})^2)\n$$\nPutting everything over a common denominator of $4$:\n$$\nVar(M) = \\frac{2((\\mu_{aa})^2 + (\\mu_{Aa})^2) - ((\\mu_{aa})^2 + 2\\mu_{aa}\\mu_{Aa} + (\\mu_{Aa})^2)}{4}\n$$\n$$\nVar(M) = \\frac{2(\\mu_{aa})^2 + 2(\\mu_{Aa})^2 - (\\mu_{aa})^2 - 2\\mu_{aa}\\mu_{Aa} - (\\mu_{Aa})^2}{4}\n$$\n$$\nVar(M) = \\frac{(\\mu_{Aa})^2 - 2\\mu_{aa}\\mu_{Aa} + (\\mu_{aa})^2}{4} = \\frac{(\\mu_{Aa} - \\mu_{aa})^2}{4}\n$$\nThe problem defines $\\Delta := \\mu_{Aa} - \\mu_{aa}$. Substituting this definition, we get:\n$$\nVar(E[Y \\mid G]) = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{4}\n$$\n\nFinally, we combine the two components to find the total phenotypic variance $Var(Y)$:\n$$\nVar(Y) = E[Var(Y \\mid G)] + Var(E[Y \\mid G]) = \\sigma^2 + \\frac{\\Delta^2}{4}\n$$\nThe theoretical population variance of $Y$ among the backcross progeny is the sum of the environmental variance $\\sigma^2$ and the genetic variance $\\frac{\\Delta^2}{4}$.

It is a complete, consistent, and formalizable problem within the field of genetics and probability theory.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe genotype of an offspring from the testcross $AaBb \\times aabb$ is determined by the gamete contributed by the $AaBb$ parent, as the $aabb$ parent can only produce gametes of genotype $ab$. The four possible gametes from the $AaBb$ parent are $AB$, $Ab$, $aB$, and $ab$.\n\nAccording to Mendel's law of segregation, for the $A/a$ locus, the probability of an $A$ allele being in a gamete is $P(A) = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of an $a$ allele is $P(a) = \\frac{1}{2}$. Similarly, for the $B/b$ locus, the probability of a $B$ allele is $P(B) = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of a $b$ allele is $P(b) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nAccording to Mendel's law of independent assortment, the segregation of alleles at the $A/a$ locus is independent of the segregation of alleles at the $B/b$ locus. Therefore, we can calculate the probability of each gamete type by multiplying the probabilities of the constituent alleles:\n- Probability of gamete $AB$: $p_{AB} = P(A) \\times P(B) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- Probability of gamete $Ab$: $p_{Ab} = P(A) \\times P(b) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- Probability of gamete $aB$: $p_{aB} = P(a) \\times P(B) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- Probability of gamete $ab$: $p_{ab} = P(a) \\times P(b) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThese probabilities correspond to the probabilities of observing an offspring in each of the four phenotypic/genotypic classes in the testcross. Let $p_k$ be the probability of an offspring belonging to class $k$, where $k \\in \\{AB, Ab, aB, ab\\}$. We have $p_{AB} = p_{Ab} = p_{aB} = p_{ab} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe problem states that there are $N$ total progeny, and each outcome is independent and identically distributed. This describes a series of $N$ Bernoulli trials for each class. For any specific class $k$, an offspring either belongs to that class (a \"success\") with probability $p_k$, or it does not (a \"failure\") with probability $1 - p_k$. The total count of successes in $N$ trials, $X_k$, therefore follows a binomial distribution, $X_k \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, p_k)$.\n\nThe expected value (mean) of a binomial random variable $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)$ is given by the formula $E[X] = np$.

The language is objective and unambiguous. The problem does not violate any criteria for invalidity; it is a standard, formalizable problem in theoretical genetics. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution is derived from first principles.\n\nFirst, we determine the genotype of the F1 generation. The parental cross (P generation) is between a homozygous dominant individual, with genotype $G_P_1 = A_1A_1\\,A_2A_2\\,\\dots\\,A_nA_n$, and a homozygous recessive individual, with genotype $G_P_2 = a_1a_1\\,a_2a_2\\,\\dots\\,a_na_n$. The first parent ($P_1$) can only produce one type of gamete: $g_1 = A_1\\,A_2\\,\\dots\\,A_n$. The second parent ($P_2$) can only produce one type of gamete: $g_2 = a_1\\,a_2\\,\\dots\\,a_n$. The fusion of these gametes results in all F1 individuals having the identical genotype: $G_{F1} = A_1a_1\\,A_2a_2\\,\\dots\\,A_na_n$. These individuals are heterozygous at all $n$ loci.\n\nNext, we analyze the production of the F2 generation, which results from the self-crossing of F1 individuals ($G_{F1} \\times G_{F1}$). The problem asks for the proportion of F2 offspring expressing the dominant phenotype at all $n$ loci.\n\nDue to the law of independent assortment (Assumption ii), the segregation of alleles at any given locus $i$ is independent of the segregation of alleles at any other locus $j$ (where $i \\neq j$). This allows us to analyze each locus independently and then combine the probabilities. The probability of an F2 individual having the dominant phenotype at all $n$ loci is the product of the probabilities of having the dominant phenotype at each individual locus. Let $P_{dom}^{(n)}$ be the probability of the dominant multilocus phenotype. Then:\n$$P_{dom}^{(n)} = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(\\text{dominant phenotype at locus } i)$$\nSince the genetic conditions are identical for all loci, the probability of expressing the dominant phenotype is the same for each locus. Let this probability be $p_{dom}$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$P_{dom}^{(n)} = (p_{dom})^n$$\n\nWe now calculate $p_{dom}$ for a single arbitrary locus $i$. This involves a standard monohybrid cross of the F1 generation: $A_ia_i \\times A_ia_i$. According to the law of segregation (Assumption i), each F1 parent produces two types of gametes, $A_i$ and $a_i$, with equal probability, $P(A_i) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $P(a_i) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe possible genotypes in the F2 generation for locus $i$ and their respective probabilities are determined by the random combination of these gametes:\n1.  Genotype $A_iA_i$: occurs when a gamete $A_i$ from the first parent fertilizes a gamete $A_i$ from the second parent. The probability is $P(A_iA_i) = P(A_i) \\times P(A_i) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n2.  Genotype $A_ia_i$: occurs in two ways. An $A_i$ gamete from the first parent fertilizes an $a_i$ gamete from the second, or an $a_i$ gamete from the first fertilizes an $A_i$ gamete from the second. The total probability is $P(A_ia_i) = (P(A_i) \\times P(a_i)) + (P(a_i) \\times P(A_i)) = (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n3.  Genotype $a_ia_i$: occurs when an $a_i$ gamete from the first parent fertilizes an $a_i$ gamete from the second. The probability is $P(a_ia_i) = P(a_i) \\times P(a_i) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe F2 generation thus exhibits a genotypic ratio of $1 A_iA_i : 2 A_ia_i : 1 a_ia_i$.\n\nAccording to the principle of complete dominance (Assumption iii), the dominant phenotype is expressed by any individual with at least one $A_i$ allele. These are the genotypes $A_iA_i$ and $A_ia_i$. The recessive phenotype is expressed only by the genotype $a_ia_i$.\nThe probability, $p_{dom}$, of an F2 individual having the dominant phenotype at locus $i$ is the sum of the probabilities of the corresponding genotypes:\n$$p_{dom} = P(A_iA_i) + P(A_ia_i) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nThis corresponds to the classic $3:1$ phenotypic segregation ratio for a monohybrid cross.\n\nFinally, we substitute this single-locus probability back into the multilocus expression. The expected segregation ratio, which is the probability of an F2 individual exhibiting the dominant phenotype at all $n$ unlinked loci simultaneously, is:\n$$P_{dom}^{(n)} = (p_{dom})^n = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^n}$$", "id": "2828729"}]}
