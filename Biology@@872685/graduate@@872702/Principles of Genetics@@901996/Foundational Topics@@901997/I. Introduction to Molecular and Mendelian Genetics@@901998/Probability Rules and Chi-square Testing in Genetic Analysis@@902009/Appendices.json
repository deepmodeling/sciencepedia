I will address each part in sequence, adhering to strict logical and mathematical formalism.\n\nFirst, we establish the probabilistic framework. The parents are both heterozygous carriers, so the parental cross is $Aa \\times Aa$. According to Mendel's law of segregation, each parent produces two types of gametes, $A$ and $a$, with equal probability $p = \\frac{1}{2}$. Assuming random union of gametes, the probabilities of the offspring genotypes are given by the expansion of the binomial $(\\frac{1}{2}A + \\frac{1}{2}a)^2$:\n$$P(AA) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n$$P(Aa) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$P(aa) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nThe disorder is autosomal recessive with complete penetrance, meaning an individual is affected if and only if their genotype is $aa$. Let $C_i$ be the event that the $i$-th child is affected, and $U_i$ be the event that the $i$-th child is unaffected. The probabilities for any given child are:\n$$P(C_i) = P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n$$P(U_i) = P(AA) + P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nNote that $P(C_i) + P(U_i) = 1$, as it must be.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the conditional probability that the third child is affected given that the first two children are unaffected. This is denoted as $P(C_3 | U_1 \\cap U_2)$. By the fundamental definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$P(C_3 | U_1 \\cap U_2) = \\frac{P(C_3 \\cap U_1 \\cap U_2)}{P(U_1 \\cap U_2)}$$\nA critical premise of the problem is that \"meioses and fertilizations for different offspring are independent across conceptions.\" This implies that the health status of each child is a statistically independent event. For a set of independent events, the probability of their joint occurrence is the product of their individual probabilities. Therefore:\n$$P(C_3 \\cap U_1 \\cap U_2) = P(C_3) \\times P(U_1) \\times P(U_2)$$\nAnd for the conditioning event:\n$$P(U_1 \\cap U_2) = P(U_1) \\times P(U_2)$$\nSubstituting these into the conditional probability formula yields:\n$$P(C_3 | U_1 \\cap U_2) = \\frac{P(C_3) \\times P(U_1) \\times P(U_2)}{P(U_1) \\times P(U_2)}$$\nSince $P(U_1) = \\frac{3}{4} > 0$ and $P(U_2) = \\frac{3}{4} > 0$, the terms in the denominator are non-zero, and we can cancel them, which leads to:\n$$P(C_3 | U_1 \\cap U_2) = P(C_3) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nThe reason this conditional probability is identical to the marginal probability is a direct and necessary consequence of the independence of successive births. The mathematical definition of independence between two events $A$ and $B$ is $P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$, which implies $P(A|B) = P(A)$. In this genetic context, the biological process for each conception is a stochastic event whose outcome probabilities ($P(C_i) = \\frac{1}{4}$) are determined solely by the fixed genotypes of the parents and are not influenced by the outcomes of previous conceptions. Therefore, knowing that the first two children are unaffected provides no new information to update the probability for the third child. Each birth is an independent trial.\n\nNext, we perform the goodness-of-fit test. The null hypothesis ($H_0$) is that the probability of the third child being affected in the specified families follows the Mendelian model, i.e., $p_{A} = \\frac{1}{4}$. Consequently, the probability of being unaffected is $p_{U} = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nThe study includes a cohort of $N = 320$ families that meet the condition (first two children are unaffected). The expected counts for the two possible outcomes for the third child are:\nExpected affected: $E_{A} = N \\times p_{A} = 320 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 80$\nExpected unaffected: $E_{U} = N \\times p_{U} = 320 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 240$\nThe observed counts are given as:\nObserved affected: $O_{A} = 68$\nObserved unaffected: $O_{U} = 252$\nThe Pearson's chi-square statistic ($\\chi^2$) is calculated using the formula:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i} \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$\nFor the two categories, this becomes:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{(O_{A} - E_{A})^2}{E_{A}} + \\frac{(O_{U} - E_{U})^2}{E_{U}}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{(68 - 80)^2}{80} + \\frac{(252 - 240)^2}{240}$$\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{(-12)^2}{80} + \\frac{(12)^2}{240}$$\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{144}{80} + \\frac{144}{240}$$\nPerforming the arithmetic:\n$$\\chi^2 = 1.8 + 0.6 = 2.4$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.

We will use the notation $z_p$ for the upper quantile, i.e., $P(Z > z_p) = p$. Hence, $\\sqrt{C} = z_{\\alpha/2}$.\n\nSubstituting this and $\\sqrt{\\lambda} = \\sqrt{nF^2} = F\\sqrt{n}$ into the power equation:\n$$\\pi = P(Z > z_{\\alpha/2} - F\\sqrt{n}) + P(Z  -z_{\\alpha/2} - F\\sqrt{n})$$\nFor a power of $\\pi = 0.80$, the term $F\\sqrt{n}$ will be significantly larger than $z_{\\alpha/2}$, making the second term, $\\Phi(-z_{\\alpha/2} - F\\sqrt{n})$, negligible. Thus, we can approximate the power as:\n$$\\pi \\approx P(Z > z_{\\alpha/2} - F\\sqrt{n})$$\nWe want this probability to be equal to $\\pi = 1-\\beta$. The standard normal quantile $z_\\beta$ is defined by $P(Z > z_\\beta) = \\beta$. Therefore, we must have:\n$$z_{\\alpha/2} - F\\sqrt{n} \\approx z_{1-\\pi} = z_\\beta$$\n(Noting $z_{1-\\pi} = -z_{\\pi}$), the equation is commonly written using positive quantiles:\n$$F\\sqrt{n} \\approx z_{\\alpha/2} + z_{\\beta}$$\n$$\\sqrt{n} \\approx \\frac{z_{\\alpha/2} + z_{\\beta}}{F}$$\n$$n \\approx \\left(\\frac{z_{\\alpha/2} + z_{\\beta}}{F}\\right)^2$$\nWe are given $\\alpha = 0.05$, $\\pi = 0.80$, and $F = 0.05$. This implies $\\beta = 1 - \\pi = 0.20$. We find the required quantiles from the standard normal distribution:\n$z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025} = \\Phi^{-1}(0.975) \\approx 1.95996$\n$z_{\\beta} = z_{0.20} = \\Phi^{-1}(0.80) \\approx 0.84162$\nNow we substitute these values into the expression for $n$:\n$$\\sqrt{n} \\approx \\frac{1.95996 + 0.84162}{0.05} = \\frac{2.80158}{0.05} = 56.0316$$\n$$n \\approx (56.0316)^2 \\approx 3139.54$$\nSince the sample size $n$ must be an integer, we must check the smallest integer at or above this value. We test $n=3139$ and $n=3140$. We use the more accurate power formula $\\pi(n) = \\Phi(F\\sqrt{n} - z_{\\alpha/2}) + \\Phi(-F\\sqrt{n} - z_{\\alpha/2})$.\nFor $n = 3139$:\n$\\sqrt{n} \\approx 56.02678$\n$F\\sqrt{n} \\approx 0.05 \\times 56.02678 \\approx 2.80134$\n$\\pi(3139) = \\Phi(2.80134 - 1.95996) + \\Phi(-2.80134 - 1.95996) = \\Phi(0.84138) + \\Phi(-4.7613) \\approx 0.79993 + 9.7 \\times 10^{-7} \\approx 0.79993$\nThis power is just below the required $0.80$.\n\nFor $n = 3140$:\n$\\sqrt{n} \\approx 56.03570$\n$F\\sqrt{n} \\approx 0.05 \\times 56.03570 \\approx 2.80179$\n$\\pi(3140) = \\Phi(2.80179 - 1.95996) + \\Phi(-2.80179 - 1.95996) = \\Phi(0.84183) + \\Phi(-4.76175) \\approx 0.80006 + 9.6 \\times 10^{-7} \\approx 0.80006$\nThis power exceeds the requirement. Therefore, the minimal integer sample size is $3140$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3140}$$", "id": "2841867"}]}
