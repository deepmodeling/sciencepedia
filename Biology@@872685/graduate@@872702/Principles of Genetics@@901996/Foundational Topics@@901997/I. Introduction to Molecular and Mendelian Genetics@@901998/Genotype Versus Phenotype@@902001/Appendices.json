Let $V_P = \\operatorname{Var}(P)$, $V_G = \\operatorname{Var}(G)$, $V_E = \\operatorname{Var}(E)$, and narrow-sense heritability $h^2 = V_A/V_P$, where $V_A$ is the additive genetic variance.

The model $P = G + E$, the variance decomposition $V_P = V_G + V_E$ (which follows from $\\operatorname{Cov}(G,E)=0$), and the definition of narrow-sense heritability $h^2$ are all standard in quantitative genetics. The problem explores the critical and often misunderstood distinction between the sources of variation within a population (measured by $h^2$) and the causes of changes in the population mean.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. The givens are sufficient to evaluate the statements. The statement \"hence $h^2 = 0.9$\" implies that we are to assume $V_G$ consists only of additive variance, i.e., $V_G = V_A$. With this standard simplification, $V_P = V_A + V_E = 90 + 10 = 100$, and thus $h^2 = V_A/V_P = 90/100 = 0.9$, which is self-consistent. The problem is objective and free of ambiguity. It does not violate any checklist items for invalid problems.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Principles**\n\nThe model for the phenotype in the initial environment $\\mathcal{E}_0$ is $P = G + E$.\nThe population mean is $\\bar{P}_0 = \\mathbb{E}[P] = \\mathbb{E}[G] + \\mathbb{E}[E]$. We are given $\\bar{P}_0 = 100$.\nThe phenotypic variance is $V_P = \\operatorname{Var}(P) = \\operatorname{Var}(G+E)$. Given $\\operatorname{Cov}(G,E)=0$, this simplifies to $V_P = \\operatorname{Var}(G) + \\operatorname{Var}(E) = V_G + V_E$.\nBased on the problem's data and the implication that $h^2=0.9$, we assume $V_G$ is entirely additive, so $V_G=V_A=90$. Thus, $V_P = V_A + V_E = 90 + 10 = 100$.\nThe narrow-sense heritability is $h^2 = V_A/V_P = 90/100 = 0.9$.\n\nNow, consider the intervention leading to environment $\\mathcal{E}_1$. A constant $c$ is added to the environmental component for every individual.\nThe new phenotype is $P' = G + (E + c)$.\n\nLet us compute the new mean, $\\bar{P}_1$:\n$$ \\bar{P}_1 = \\mathbb{E}[P'] = \\mathbb{E}[G + E + c] = \\mathbb{E}[G] + \\mathbb{E}[E] + \\mathbb{E}[c] $$\nSince $c$ is a constant, $\\mathbb{E}[c] = c$.\n$$ \\bar{P}_1 = (\\mathbb{E}[G] + \\mathbb{E}[E]) + c = \\bar{P}_0 + c $$\nThis shows that a uniform environmental shift of $c$ changes the population mean by exactly $c$.\n\nNext, let us compute the new phenotypic variance, $V_{P'}$:\n$$ V_{P'} = \\operatorname{Var}(P') = \\operatorname{Var}(G + E + c) $$\nA fundamental property of variance is that it is invariant to constant shifts, i.e., $\\operatorname{Var}(X+k) = \\operatorname{Var}(X)$.\n$$ V_{P'} = \\operatorname{Var}(G+E) = V_P = 100 $$\nThe genotypic variance $V_G$ and environmental variance $V_E = \\operatorname{Var}(E)$ are also unchanged. Specifically, $V_{E'} = \\operatorname{Var}(E+c) = \\operatorname{Var}(E) = V_E = 10$. The genetic composition of the population has not changed, so $V_A$ remains $90$.\n\nFinally, let us compute the new heritability, $h'^2$:\n$$ h'^2 = \\frac{V_A'}{V_{P'}} $$\nSince the genotypes have not changed, $V_A' = V_A = 90$. We found that $V_{P'} = V_P = 100$.\n$$ h'^2 = \\frac{90}{100} = 0.9 = h^2 $$\nTherefore, a uniform environmental change $c$ shifts the mean by $c$ but leaves all variance components ($V_P$, $V_A$, $V_E$) and the heritability ($h^2$) unchanged, under the specified model (no GxE). The core conclusion is that high heritability, a measure of within-population variation, places no constraint on the magnitude of change in the population mean due to a uniform environmental shift.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. A uniform supplementation program in $\\mathcal{E}_1$ adds $c=+5$ to $E$ for every individual while leaving $V_E$ unchanged; then $\\bar{P}$ increases from $100$ to $105$, $V_P$ remains $V_G+V_E=100$, and $h^2$ remains near $0.9$. This shows that high $h^2$ does not prevent a sizeable mean shift.\n- According to our derivation, adding $c=+5$ increases the mean from $\\bar{P}_0=100$ to $\\bar{P}_1 = 100 + 5 = 105$. This is correct.\n- As derived, $V_P$ remains unchanged at $V_A + V_E = 90 + 10 = 100$. This is correct.\n- As derived, $h^2$ remains unchanged at $0.9$. The statement \"remains near $0.9$\" is correct.\n- The conclusion that this demonstrates a mean shift is possible despite high $h^2$ is the correct interpretation of the result.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Suppose that in $\\mathcal{E}_0$ there is endemic micronutrient deficiency such that the average environmental contribution is depressed by $-8$ with small dispersion (i.e., $V_E$ is small around a negative mean). Iodization that is applied uniformly adds approximately $+8$ to everyone’s $E$ (so $c=+8$), raising the mean by $8$ even though $h^2$ remains high within each environment. This is consistent with high $h^2$ and a large mean shift.\n- This is a concrete example fitting the model. \"Small dispersion\" is consistent with $V_E=10$ being small relative to $V_A=90$.\n- A uniform addition of $c=+8$ will raise the mean by $8$. This is correct.\n- As per the derivation, $h^2$ will remain high ($0.9$) because the variances are unchanged. This is correct.\n- The conclusion that this scenario is \"consistent with high $h^2$ and a large mean shift\" is a correct statement of the principle.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. Because $h^2=0.9$, at most $10\\%$ of the mean can change via environment; therefore, eliminating a uniform toxicant exposure that depresses the trait by $-3$ cannot increase the mean by more than $0.3$. Hence a substantial mean shift by environmental means is impossible when $h^2$ is high.\n- This statement fundamentally misinterprets heritability. $h^2=0.9$ means $1-h^2=0.1$ or $10\\%$ of the *variance* is environmental, not $10\\%$ of the *mean*. The mean $\\bar{P}$ and the variance $V_P$ are independent quantities.\n- Eliminating a uniform toxicant that depresses the trait by $-3$ is equivalent to an intervention with $c=+3$.\n- The change in the mean is $\\Delta\\bar{P} = c = +3$. The new mean would be $100+3=103$.\n- The statement's claim that the mean cannot increase by more than $0.3$ is false. It is derived from the nonsensical calculation $(1-h^2) \\times 3 = 0.1 \\times 3 = 0.3$. This has no basis in quantitative genetics.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. If $V_E$ is small and there is no genotype-by-environment interaction, then changing the environment cannot change $\\bar{P}$; only changes in allele frequencies can. Therefore, high $h^2$ implies that the mean phenotype is genetically fixed over short time scales.\n- The premise \"If $V_E$ is small ... changing the environment cannot change $\\bar{P}$\" is false. Small $V_E$ implies environment causes little variation *among individuals* in the current population. It does not preclude the *mean environment* $\\mathbb{E}[E]$ from being shifted, which in turn shifts $\\bar{P}$. Our derivation shows a uniform environmental change shifts $\\bar{P}$ regardless of the magnitude of $V_E$.\n- The conclusion that high $h^2$ implies the mean is \"genetically fixed\" is the precise fallacy of genetic determinism that this problem serves to correct.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. In a twin study with $h^2 \\approx 0.9$, increasing average caloric intake by a fixed $+500$ kilocalories per day across the cohort must reduce $h^2$ substantially, because the phenotype becomes “more environmental” when the mean environment changes, even if $V_E$ is unchanged.\n- A \"fixed $+500$ kilocalories\" is a uniform environmental change, $c=+500$.\n- The premise is \"even if $V_E$ is unchanged\". If $V_E$ is unchanged, and $V_A$ is unchanged (as genotypes are constant), then $V_P = V_A + V_E$ is also unchanged.\n- In this case, $h^2 = V_A/V_P$ must also be unchanged. The claim that $h^2$ \"must reduce ... substantially\" is a direct contradiction of the premises.\n- The reasoning \"because the phenotype becomes 'more environmental'\" is a vague, intuitive error; heritability is a ratio of variances, not a descriptor of the absolute value of the mean.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nF. In a multi-genotype crop variety trial with $V_A$ large and $V_E \\approx 0$ under tightly controlled field conditions ($h^2 \\approx 1$ within each field), turning on drip irrigation for all plots adds a roughly constant $c=+20$ centimeters to plant height across genotypes. The population mean height increases by about $20$ while $V_P$ and $h^2$ within the irrigated field remain essentially unchanged. This illustrates that high $h^2$ does not entail immutability of the mean.\n- This provides another correct, concrete example. High $V_A$ and low $V_E \\approx 0$ correctly implies $h^2 \\approx V_A/(V_A+0) \\approx 1$.\n- A uniform change of $c \\approx +20$ correctly results in a mean shift of $\\Delta\\bar{P} \\approx +20$.\n- As the change is uniform (no GxE), the variances $V_P$ and $V_A$ are unchanged, and so $h^2$ remains unchanged.\n- The final sentence correctly concludes that this scenario illustrates that a high heritability does not imply the mean is immutable.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABF}$$", "id": "2819881"}]}
