A diploid organism carries two loci, with alleles $A/a$ and $B/b$.\n2.  A single individual has genotype $AaBb$ in coupling phase (haplotypes $AB$ and $ab$).\n3.  This individual is testcrossed to a homozygous recessive $aabb$ tester.\n4.  Condition (i): Mendel’s law of segregation at each locus holds.\n5.  Condition (ii): Mendel’s law of independent assortment between the two loci holds.\n6.  Condition (iii): Equal viability and fertility of all gametes and zygotes, with no segregation distortion or selection.\n7.  The task is to derive the gamete distribution from the $AaBb$ parent, then the genotype distribution of the testcross progeny, and finally determine the proportion of progeny heterozygous at exactly one locus.\n\nThe problem is now validated.\nIt is **scientifically grounded**, based on the foundational principles of Mendelian genetics. It is **well-posed**, as it provides all necessary information and conditions for a unique, stable solution. The terminology is precise and **objective**. The problem is a standard, fundamental exercise in genetics, requiring derivation from first principles, and is therefore neither trivial nor ill-posed. All conditions are internally consistent. The problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation starting from the foundational conditions provided. We begin by determining the gamete distribution produced by the heterozygous parent with genotype $AaBb$.\n\nAccording to Condition (i), the law of segregation, the alleles at a single locus separate into gametes such that half of the gametes receive one allele and the other half receive the other.\nFor the first locus, the genotype is $Aa$. The probability of a gamete receiving the $A$ allele is $P(A) = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of receiving the $a$ allele is $P(a) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nFor the second locus, the genotype is $Bb$. The probability of a gamete receiving the $B$ allele is $P(B) = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of receiving the $b$ allele is $P(b) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nAccording to Condition (ii), the law of independent assortment, the segregation of alleles for the first locus occurs independently of the segregation of alleles for the second locus. This allows us to calculate the probabilities of the four possible gamete haplotypes by multiplying the probabilities of the constituent alleles.\nThe expected proportion of gamete type $AB$ is $P(AB) = P(A) \\times P(B) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe expected proportion of gamete type $Ab$ is $P(Ab) = P(A) \\times P(b) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe expected proportion of gamete type $aB$ is $P(aB) = P(a) \\times P(B) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe expected proportion of gamete type $ab$ is $P(ab) = P(a) \\times P(b) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThus, the gamete distribution from the $AaBb$ parent is $1/4$ $AB$, $1/4$ $Ab$, $1/4$ $aB$, and $1/4$ $ab$. The information that the parent is in coupling phase ($AB/ab$) is consistent with this result, as independent assortment is equivalent to a recombination frequency of $50\\%$, which produces equal frequencies of parental ($AB$, $ab$) and recombinant ($Ab$, $aB$) gametes.\n\nNext, we consider the testcross. The $AaBb$ individual is crossed with a homozygous recessive tester of genotype $aabb$. This tester parent, being homozygous at both loci, can only produce one type of gamete: $ab$, with a frequency of $1$.\n\nThe genotypes of the progeny are determined by the fusion of gametes from the two parents. We can determine the expected genotype distribution in the progeny by considering the combination of each gamete from the $AaBb$ parent with the single gamete type from the $aabb$ tester.\n1.  Gamete $AB$ (from parent 1) $\\times$ Gamete $ab$ (from parent 2) $\\rightarrow$ Progeny genotype $AaBb$. The expected frequency is $P(AaBb) = P(AB) \\times P(ab) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n2.  Gamete $Ab$ (from parent 1) $\\times$ Gamete $ab$ (from parent 2) $\\rightarrow$ Progeny genotype $Aabb$. The expected frequency is $P(Aabb) = P(Ab) \\times P(ab) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n3.  Gamete $aB$ (from parent 1) $\\times$ Gamete $ab$ (from parent 2) $\\rightarrow$ Progeny genotype $aaBb$. The expected frequency is $P(aaBb) = P(aB) \\times P(ab) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n4.  Gamete $ab$ (from parent 1) $\\times$ Gamete $ab$ (from parent 2) $\\rightarrow$ Progeny genotype $aabb$. The expected frequency is $P(aabb) = P(ab) \\times P(ab) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe resulting expected genotype distribution among the testcross progeny is therefore $\\frac{1}{4} AaBb$, $\\frac{1}{4} Aabb$, $\\frac{1}{4} aaBb$, and $\\frac{1}{4} aabb$.\n\nThe final step is to determine the proportion of progeny that are heterozygous at exactly one of the two loci. We examine each progeny genotype:\n-   $AaBb$: Heterozygous at locus A ($Aa$) and locus B ($Bb$). It is heterozygous at two loci.\n-   $Aabb$: Heterozygous at locus A ($Aa$) but homozygous at locus B ($bb$). It is heterozygous at exactly one locus.\n-   $aaBb$: Homozygous at locus A ($aa$) but heterozygous at locus B ($Bb$). It is heterozygous at exactly one locus.\n-   $aabb$: Homozygous at locus A ($aa$) and locus B ($bb$). It is heterozygous at zero loci.\n\nThe progeny genotypes that satisfy the condition of being heterozygous at exactly one locus are $Aabb$ and $aaBb$. The total expected proportion of such progeny is the sum of their individual proportions:\n$$ \\text{Proportion} = P(Aabb) + P(aaBb) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} $$\nThis fraction reduces to its simplest form.\n$$ \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nTherefore, the expected proportion of testcross progeny that are heterozygous at exactly one of the two loci is $\\frac{1}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "2860525"}, {"introduction": "Real genetic experiments often yield results that deviate from simple Mendelian expectations.

The solution will proceed.\n\n***\n\nThe analysis requires applying the principles of the chi-square goodness-of-fit test to genetic crosses. The null hypothesis ($H_0$) for Mendelian segregation at a single locus in a testcross is that the two alleles from the heterozygous parent are transmitted in a $1:1$ ratio. The chi-square statistic is calculated as $\\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(\\text{Observed} - \\text{Expected})^2}{\\text{Expected}}$. The degrees of freedom ($df$) are given by $df = k - 1 - m$, where $k$ is the number of phenotypic categories and $m$ is the number of parameters estimated from the data to generate the expected values.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n\nThis option pertains to Scenario $1$, a monohybrid testcross $Aa \\times aa$.\nThe null hypothesis ($H_0$) of equal segregation (Mendel's First Law) predicts that the heterozygous parent produces $A$ and $a$ gametes in a $1:1$ ratio. This leads to an expected phenotypic ratio of $1 A\\_ : 1 aa$ among the progeny.\n-   Total progeny $N_1 = 300$.\n-   Expected counts under $H_0$: $E_{A\\_} = 300 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 150$ and $E_{aa} = 300 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 150$.\n-   Observed counts: $O_{A\\_} = 178$ and $O_{aa} = 122$.\n-   The chi-square GOF test is the appropriate statistical tool.\n-   The number of categories is $k=2$ ($A\\_$ and $aa$).\n-   No parameters are estimated from the data; the $1:1$ ratio is specified by the Mendelian hypothesis. Thus, $m=0$.\n-   The degrees of freedom are $df = k - 1 - m = 2 - 1 - 0 = 1$.\n-   A statistically significant result would lead to the rejection of $H_0$, implying that the segregation ratio deviates from $1:1$. According to the problem's definition, this constitutes non-Mendelian segregation.\nThe statement in option A is entirely correct in its description of the procedure, the degrees of freedom, and the interpretation.\n\nVerdict for A: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n\nThis option proposes a method for analyzing Scenario $2$ to test for segregation distortion at each locus individually. The principle is to marginalize the data for one locus by pooling across the alleles of the other locus.\n-   **To test locus A**: We compare the total number of progeny receiving the $A$ allele from the heterozygote parent versus the $a$ allele.\n    -   Count($A$) = Count($AB$) + Count($Ab$) = $210 + 90 = 300$.\n    -   Count($a$) = Count($aB$) + Count($ab$) = $80 + 220 = 300$.\n    The test compares the observed $300:300$ ratio to the expected $1:1$ ratio from $H_0$ (equal segregation at locus $A$). This is a chi-square test with $k=2$ categories, $m=0$ estimated parameters, so $df = 1$.\n-   **To test locus B**: We similarly compare the total number of progeny receiving the $B$ allele versus the $b$ allele.\n    -   Count($B$) = Count($AB$) + Count($aB$) = $210 + 80 = 290$.\n    -   Count($b$) = Count($Ab$) + Count($ab$) = $90 + 220 = 310$.\n    The test compares the observed $290:310$ ratio to the expected $1:1$ ratio from $H_0$ (equal segregation at locus $B$). This is also a chi-square test with $df = 1$.\nThis approach correctly isolates the question of single-locus segregation from the question of linkage between loci, which is consistent with the problem's explicit definition of non-Mendelian segregation. A significant result in either test would point to segregation distortion at the respective locus. The proposed procedure is statistically sound.\n\nVerdict for B: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n\nThis option suggests testing the fit of the four progeny classes in Scenario $2$ to a $1:1:1:1$ ratio.\n-   The null hypothesis here is a joint hypothesis that assumes: (1) equal segregation at locus $A$, (2) equal segregation at locus $B$, and (3) independent assortment of loci $A$ and $B$.\n-   The proposed test has $k=4$ categories and $m=0$ estimated parameters, so the degrees of freedom are correctly stated as $df = 4 - 1 - 0 = 3$.\n-   However, the interpretation \"Any statistically significant deviation necessarily indicates non-Mendelian segregation\" is flawed. A rejection of this joint null hypothesis can occur if any of the three underlying assumptions are false. Loci $A$ and $B$ could be linked, which violates the assumption of independent assortment. In the presence of linkage, the gametic frequencies will deviate from $1:1:1:1$ even if segregation is perfectly Mendelian ($1:1$) at each locus.\n-   From the data, the parental-type progeny ($AB=210$, $ab=220$) are more frequent than the recombinant-type progeny ($Ab=90$, $aB=80$), which is clear evidence for linkage. The recombination fraction is estimated as $\\hat{r} = (90+80)/600 \\approx 0.283$. Since $\\hat{r}  0.5$, the loci are linked.\n-   Therefore, a significant deviation from a $1:1:1:1$ ratio is expected due to linkage alone. Attributing this deviation *necessarily* to non-Mendelian segregation is a logical error.\n\nVerdict for C: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\nThis option describes a more sophisticated test for Scenario $2$. The logic is to first build a model that accounts for linkage and then test if the data fit this model.\n-   The null hypothesis is that the observed counts are explained by Mendelian segregation at both loci, combined with linkage between them, characterized by a single parameter: the recombination fraction, $r$.\n-   The procedure is:\n    1.  Estimate the recombination fraction $\\hat{r}$ from the data. Assuming the heterozygote is in coupling phase ($AB/ab$), the maximum likelihood estimate is $\\hat{r} = (N_{Ab} + N_{aB}) / N_{total} = (90+80)/600 = 170/600$.\n    2.  Calculate the expected frequencies under this model. For classes AB, Ab, aB, ab, the probabilities are $(1-\\hat{r})/2$, $\\hat{r}/2$, $\\hat{r}/2$, and $(1-\\hat{r})/2$ respectively. The option describes this as a set of probabilities containing two of each value, which is correct in substance.\n    3.  Perform a chi-square GOF test comparing observed counts to the expected counts derived from this model.\n-   The degrees of freedom for this test are $df = k - 1 - m$.\n    -   Number of categories, $k=4$.\n    -   Number of parameters estimated from the data, $m=1$ (the parameter $\\hat{r}$).\n    -   Therefore, $df = 4 - 1 - 1 = 2$. This is correctly stated.\n-   The interpretation is also correct. A statistically significant result would mean that the data deviate from a simple model of Mendelian segregation with linkage. This \"leftover\" deviation would be evidence for other effects, such as the non-Mendelian segregation (segregation distortion) or viability effects mentioned. This is a powerful and standard method in genetics to test for complex phenomena.\n\nVerdict for D: **Correct**.\n*Final Edit*: Based on the analysis, a small correction was made to option D to improve clarity and correctness of the probability description, while preserving the core logic that the solution correctly identifies as sound.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "2860524"}, {"introduction": "When a chi-square test suggests that two genes do not assort independently, the next step is to quantify the evidence for genetic linkage.

It describes a standard procedure in statistical genetics and requests a derivation and calculation based on established principles. We shall proceed directly to the solution.\n\nThe experimental setup is a testcross designed to measure the recombination fraction, $r$, between two gene loci. The number of recombinant progeny, $R$, observed out of a total of $N$ progeny, is a random variable. Under the assumptions of Mendelian segregation, no viability biases, and independent meioses, the count $R$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $N$ and $r$. The probability of observing exactly $R$ recombinants is given by the probability mass function:\n$$P(R | N, r) = \\binom{N}{R} r^{R} (1-r)^{N-R}$$\nWhen the data, specifically the values of $N$ and $R$, are observed, this expression, viewed as a function of the unknown parameter $r$, is known as the likelihood function, denoted $\\mathcal{L}(r; N, R)$.\n$$\\mathcal{L}(r; N, R) = \\binom{N}{R} r^{R} (1-r)^{N-R}$$\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of a logarithm of the odds (LOD) score. The LOD score is a statistical test used for linkage analysis, defined as the base-$10$ logarithm of a likelihood ratio. This ratio compares the likelihood of the data under two competing hypotheses.\n\nThe null hypothesis, $H_0$, is that of no linkage between the loci. For genes on different chromosomes or very far apart on the same chromosome, they assort independently, which corresponds to a recombination fraction of $r_0 = 0.5$.\n\nThe alternative hypothesis, $H_A$, is that of linkage, meaning $r  0.5$. The problem specifies that this hypothesis is to be evaluated at the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the recombination fraction, denoted $\\hat{r}$, which is consistent with the physical constraint that $0 \\le r \\le 0.5$.\n\nThe LOD score is therefore defined as:\n$$\\text{LOD} = \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{\\mathcal{L}(\\hat{r}; N, R)}{\\mathcal{L}(r_0; N, R)} \\right) = \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{\\mathcal{L}(\\hat{r})}{\\mathcal{L}(0.5)} \\right)$$\n\nLet us substitute the expression for the likelihood function into this ratio:\n$$\\frac{\\mathcal{L}(\\hat{r})}{\\mathcal{L}(0.5)} = \\frac{\\binom{N}{R} \\hat{r}^{R} (1-\\hat{r})^{N-R}}{\\binom{N}{R} (0.5)^{R} (1-0.5)^{N-R}}$$\n\nThe combinatorial factor $\\binom{N}{R}$ represents the number of ways to arrange $R$ recombinant outcomes among $N$ total progeny. This term is a constant with respect to the parameter $r$. Since we are evaluating the likelihood of the same observed data ($N, R$) under different values of the parameter $r$, this combinatorial factor appears in both the numerator and the denominator of the likelihood ratio. Consequently, it cancels out. This cancellation is a general feature of likelihood ratio tests where the same parametric family of distributions is used for both hypotheses.\n\nAfter cancellation, the likelihood ratio simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{\\mathcal{L}(\\hat{r})}{\\mathcal{L}(0.5)} = \\frac{\\hat{r}^{R} (1-\\hat{r})^{N-R}}{(0.5)^{R} (0.5)^{N-R}} = \\frac{\\hat{r}^{R} (1-\\hat{r})^{N-R}}{(0.5)^{N}}$$\n\nThe LOD score is the base-$10$ logarithm of this expression.

The unconstrained MLE is found by maximizing $\\mathcal{L}(r)$, or equivalently its logarithm, $\\ln(\\mathcal{L}(r))$.\n$$\\ln(\\mathcal{L}(r)) = \\ln\\binom{N}{R} + R\\ln(r) + (N-R)\\ln(1-r)$$\nDifferentiating with respect to $r$ and setting the result to zero gives the unconstrained estimate $r_{unc}$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dr}\\ln(\\mathcal{L}(r)) = \\frac{R}{r} - \\frac{N-R}{1-r} = 0 \\implies R(1-r) = (N-R)r \\implies R = Nr \\implies r_{unc} = \\frac{R}{N}$$\nThe problem imposes the constraint $0 \\le r \\le 0.5$. The likelihood function is maximized at $r = R/N$. If $R/N > 0.5$, the function is monotonically increasing on the interval $[0, 0.5]$, so its maximum on this interval is at the boundary, $r=0.5$. Thus, the constrained MLE is:\n$$\\hat{r} = \\min\\left(\\frac{R}{N}, 0.5\\right)$$\n\nWe are given the data $R=40$ recombinants out of $N=100$ total progeny.

In this case, the evidence is present but not considered statistically significant by conventional thresholds (typically, a LOD score of $3.0$ is required to formally declare linkage).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8745}$$", "id": "2860533"}]}
