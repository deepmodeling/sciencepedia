They prepared two separate batches of the phage. In the first batch, the phage's protein coats were labeled with the radioisotope sulfur-35 ($^{35}\\text{S}$). In the second batch, the phage's Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) was labeled with the radioisotope phosphorus-32 ($^{32}\\text{P}$). Each batch of labeled phages was then used to infect a separate culture of *E. coli*. After allowing time for infection to begin, the cultures were agitated in a blender to shear the phage particles from the surface of the bacterial cells. Finally, the mixtures were centrifuged to separate the heavier bacterial cells, which form a pellet at the bottom of the tube, from the lighter viral components and liquid medium, which remain in the supernatant.\n\nNow, consider a hypothetical scenario where the fundamental carrier of genetic information in the T2 bacteriophage is its protein, not its DNA.

It is free of ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. All necessary assumptions and definitions are provided for the derivation. There are no contradictions in the setup. Assumption (iv) in particular provides a critical simplification that makes the problem tractable and focused on the effect of incomplete shearing, as represented by $p$.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in quantitative biology that tests the logical interpretation of a classical experiment. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for $f_{\\mathrm{pellet}}$, the fraction of total sulfur-35 activity found in the cell pellet after centrifugation. This fraction is defined as the ratio of activity in the pellet to the total activity.\n\nLet $A_{\\text{total}}$ represent the total radioactivity from $^{35}\\text{S}$ introduced into the system. This activity is entirely contained within the phage coat proteins.\nLet $A_{\\text{pellet}}$ represent the radioactivity found in the pellet after blending and centrifugation.\nLet $A_{\\text{supernatant}}$ represent the radioactivity found in the supernatant.\n\nBy the principle of conservation of tracer, as stated in assumption (i), the total activity is partitioned entirely between these two fractions:\n$$A_{\\text{total}} = A_{\\text{pellet}} + A_{\\text{supernatant}}$$\n\nThe fraction of total activity in the pellet, $f_{\\mathrm{pellet}}$, is given by the definition:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{pellet}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{pellet}}}{A_{\\text{total}}}$$\n\nWe must now determine $A_{\\text{pellet}}$ based on the experimental process and assumptions.\n1.  According to assumption (iv), adsorption is complete. This means that before blending, all phage particles, and therefore all the $^{35}\\text{S}$-labeled protein coats, are attached to the exterior of the bacterial cells. At this stage, the activity associated with the cells is $A_{\\text{total}}$.\n2.  Assumption (ii) states that protein does not enter the cells. This is critical: all $^{35}\\text{S}$ activity remains on the outside of the bacterial cell membrane.\n3.  Blending is performed to shear the phage coats from the bacterial cells (assumption (iii)). The problem defines $p$ as the fraction of phage coats that *fail* to shear off and remain attached to the cells.\n4.  Since all the $^{35}\\text{S}$ activity ($A_{\\text{total}}$) was initially on the coats attached to cells, the total activity that remains attached to cells after blending is the fraction $p$ of the total activity.\n$$A_{\\text{attached}} = p \\cdot A_{\\text{total}}$$\n5.  During centrifugation, the bacterial cells form the pellet. Any phage components still attached to the cells will co-sediment and be part of the pellet. Therefore, the activity in the pellet, $A_{\\text{pellet}}$, is precisely the activity from the coats that remained attached to the cells.\n$$A_{\\text{pellet}} = A_{\\text{attached}} = p \\cdot A_{\\text{total}}$$\n6.  Substituting this expression for $A_{\\text{pellet}}$ into the definition of $f_{\\mathrm{pellet}}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{pellet}} = \\frac{p \\cdot A_{\\text{total}}}{A_{\\text{total}}}$$\nCanceling the term $A_{\\text{total}}$ from the numerator and denominator, we arrive at the expression for $f_{\\mathrm{pellet}}$ in terms of $p$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{pellet}} = p$$\nThis result is logical: under the given simplifying assumptions, the fraction of radioactivity found in the pellet is identical to the fraction of phage coats that were not successfully sheared from the cells.\n\nNow, we evaluate $f_{\\mathrm{pellet}}$ for the given value $p = 0.05$.\n$$f_{\\mathrm{pellet}} = 0.05$$\n\nFinally, a comment is required on the implications of this result. The Hershey-Chase experiment's conclusion—that DNA is the genetic material—is based on a comparison between the fate of protein (labeled with $^{35}\\text{S}$) and DNA (labeled with $^{32}\\text{P}$). The critical observation was that the majority of $^{32}\\text{P}$ entered the cells and was found in the pellet, whereas the vast majority of $^{35}\\text{S}$ remained outside the cells and was found in the supernatant.\n\nA finding that $f_{\\mathrm{pellet}} = 0.05$ for the $^{35}\\text{S}$ label means that only $5\\%$ of the phage protein is associated with the bacterial cells after blending. Correspondingly, $1 - p = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$, or $95\\%$, of the protein is sheared off and found in the supernatant. If a parallel experiment with $^{32}\\text{P}$ showed that a much larger fraction (e.g., $>70\\%$, as in the original experiments) entered the cell, the contrast would be stark. The small retention of $^{35}\\text{S}$ in the pellet ($5\\%$) is readily explained as experimental artifact due to incomplete shearing, as modeled by the parameter $p$. It does not represent a significant transfer of protein into the cell. Therefore, a retention of $p = 0.05$ would not undermine the conclusion. On the contrary, it strongly supports the conclusion that the bulk of the protein coat serves an external function and does not carry the genetic instructions into the host cell. The qualitative difference between the high retention of phosphorus and the low retention of sulfur is the very foundation of the experiment's conclusion.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.05}\n$$", "id": "2804531"}, {"introduction": "The Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment provided powerful evidence for DNA by demonstrating that only the enzyme DNase could abolish the \"transforming principle.\" This exercise translates that qualitative observation into a rigorous quantitative framework rooted in enzyme kinetics [@problem_id:2804629].

A solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\n**Derivation of the Model**\nThe core of the problem lies in formalizing the relationship between DNase concentration $C$ and the resulting transforming activity $A(C)$.\nAssumption (i) states that activity is dependent on intact DNA. Let $N(C)$ be the concentration of intact transforming DNA molecules remaining after incubation with DNase at concentration $C$ for a fixed time $t$. Let $N_0$ be the initial concentration of such molecules (i.e., at $C=0$).\n\nAssumption (ii) posits a pseudo-first-order relationship with respect to $C$ for a fixed time $t$. This can be derived from a fundamental rate law. The rate of degradation of intact DNA molecules can be described by a second-order reaction:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt'} = -k' N C $$\nwhere $t'$ is the reaction time and $k'$ is the second-order rate constant. Since $C$ is held constant for any given experiment and we assume it does not change significantly during the reaction, we can integrate this equation over the fixed incubation time $t$:\n$$ \\int_{N_0}^{N(t)} \\frac{dN}{N} = \\int_{0}^{t} -k' C dt' $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = -k'Ct $$\nThe fraction of remaining intact DNA after incubation is thus:\n$$ \\frac{N(C)}{N_0} = \\exp(-k'Ct) $$\nSince the incubation time $t$ is fixed across all experiments, we can define a new composite constant $k = k't$, which has units of inverse concentration. The model simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{N(C)}{N_0} = \\exp(-kC) $$\n\n**Relating the Model to Experimental Data**\nThe measured activity $A(C)$ consists of the true transforming activity, which is proportional to $N(C)$, and a constant background floor $A_{\\min}$. Thus, $A(C) = \\alpha N(C) + A_{\\min}$, where $\\alpha$ is a proportionality constant.\nAt $C=0$, $N(0)=N_0$, and the activity is maximal, $A_{\\max} = A(0) = \\alpha N_0 + A_{\\min}$.\nThe problem requires the use of a \"baseline-corrected residual transforming activity\". Let us denote this $A'_{corr}(C)$. This is defined by subtracting the baseline and normalizing by the maximum possible signal range:\n$$ A'_{corr}(C) = \\frac{A(C) - A_{\\min}}{A_{\\max} - A_{\\min}} $$\nSubstituting the relationships for $A(C)$ and $A_{\\max}$:\n$$ A'_{corr}(C) = \\frac{(\\alpha N(C) + A_{\\min}) - A_{\\min}}{(\\alpha N_0 + A_{\\min}) - A_{\\min}} = \\frac{\\alpha N(C)}{\\alpha N_0} = \\frac{N(C)}{N_0} $$\nTherefore, the baseline-corrected activity directly reflects the fraction of intact DNA, and our theoretical model is:\n$$ A'_{corr}(C) = \\exp(-kC) $$\n\n**Parameter Estimation**\nWe use the provided data to estimate the parameter $k$. First, we must calculate $A'_{corr}(C)$ for each data point using the given $A_{\\min}=0.05$ and $A_{\\max}=1.00$:\n$$ A'_{corr}(C) = \\frac{A(C) - 0.05}{1.00 - 0.05} = \\frac{A(C) - 0.05}{0.95} $$\n- For $C=1$: $A'_{corr}(1) = \\frac{0.687 - 0.05}{0.95} = \\frac{0.637}{0.95} \\approx 0.67053$\n- For $C=2$: $A'_{corr}(2) = \\frac{0.477 - 0.05}{0.95} = \\frac{0.427}{0.95} \\approx 0.44947$\n- For $C=3$: $A'_{corr}(3) = \\frac{0.336 - 0.05}{0.95} = \\frac{0.286}{0.95} \\approx 0.30105$\n- For $C=4$: $A'_{corr}(4) = \\frac{0.242 - 0.05}{0.95} = \\frac{0.192}{0.95} \\approx 0.20211$\n\nTo find $k$, we linearize the model by taking the natural logarithm:\n$$ \\ln(A'_{corr}(C)) = -kC $$\nThis equation is of the form $y = mx$, where $y = \\ln(A'_{corr}(C))$, $x=C$, and the slope is $m=-k$.
