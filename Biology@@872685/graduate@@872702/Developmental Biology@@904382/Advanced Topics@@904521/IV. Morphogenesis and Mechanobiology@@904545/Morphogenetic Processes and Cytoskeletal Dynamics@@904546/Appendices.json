Use the following experimentally grounded principles as your starting point:\n\n- Near stall conditions, the force–velocity relation of a Myosin II minifilament is approximately linear: a bound minifilament under load exerts an average force $F(v)$ that depends on the relative sliding speed $v$ between actin and myosin according to $F(v) = F_{0}\\left(1 - \\frac{v}{v_{0}}\\right)$, where $F_{0}$ is the stall force and $v_{0}$ is the unloaded sliding speed.\n\n- In an active gel description, the contractile surface tension is the sum over force dipoles per unit area. If each bound minifilament produces an average contractile dipole moment $m_{d} = F(v)\\,d$ with effective arm length $d$, and the fraction of time a minifilament is bound is the duty ratio $p$, then the cortical surface tension $T$ is proportional to the areal density of minifilaments $\\rho_{A}$ as $T = \\rho_{A}\\,p\\,m_{d}$.\n\nA cell is characterized by the following parameters under control conditions: minifilament stall force $F_{0} = 35\\,\\mathrm{pN}$, unloaded speed $v_{0} = 0.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, actin retrograde speed relative to myosin $v = 0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ (assumed unaffected by the perturbation considered here), effective dipole arm $d = 0.12\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, areal density of minifilaments $\\rho_{A} = 1200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, and duty ratio $p_{0} = 0.12$.\n\nBlebbistatin treatment reduces the Myosin II duty ratio by $60\\%$ without altering $F_{0}$, $v_{0}$, $v$, $d$, or $\\rho_{A}$ on the timescale of measurement.\n\nUsing only the principles stated above, derive and compute the cortical surface tension after Blebbistatin treatment.

This means it moves toward $x=0$, so its velocity is $v(L/2, 0^+) = -v_0$.\nSubstituting these boundary conditions into the linear velocity profile at $t=0^+$:\n$$ v(L/2, 0^+) = v(0, 0^+) + \\frac{L}{2} \\dot{\\varepsilon}(0^+) $$\n$$ -v_0 = 0 + \\frac{L}{2} \\dot{\\varepsilon}(0^+) $$\nSolving for the initial strain rate gives:\n$$ \\dot{\\varepsilon}(0^+) = -\\frac{2v_0}{L} $$\nThe negative sign correctly indicates that the junction is undergoing compression (recoiling).\n\nStep 4: Derive the expression for $F_0$.\nWe now have a system of equations. From Step 1, $F_0 = E\\,\\varepsilon_0 A$. From Step 2, $E\\,\\varepsilon_0 = -\\eta\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(0^+)$. Combining these two, we eliminate the unknown quantities $E$ and $\\varepsilon_0$:\n$$ F_0 = (-\\eta\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(0^+)) A = -A\\eta\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(0^+) $$\nNow, substitute the expression for $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(0^+)$ from Step 3:\n$$ F_0 = -A\\eta \\left(-\\frac{2v_0}{L}\\right) $$\nThis yields the final analytical expression for the pre-ablation force in terms of the given parameters:\n$$ F_0 = \\frac{2\\eta A v_0}{L} $$\n\nStep 5: Numerical calculation.\nWe are given the following values, which must be converted to base SI units for calculation:\n- $\\eta = 4.5 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 4.5 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{s}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$\n- $A = 0.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2} = 0.25 \\times (10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})^{2} = 0.25 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$\n- $v_0 = 0.47\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.47 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $L = 12\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 12 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nSubstitute these values into the derived formula for $F_0$:\n$$ F_0 = \\frac{2(4.5 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{s}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2})(0.25 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2)(0.47 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})}{12 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}} $$\nFirst, evaluate the numerical coefficients:\n$$ \\frac{2 \\times 4.5 \\times 0.25 \\times 0.47}{12} = \\frac{9.0 \\times 0.25 \\times 0.47}{12} = \\frac{2.25 \\times 0.47}{12} = \\frac{1.0575}{12} = 0.088125 $$\nNext, evaluate the powers of $10$:\n$$ \\frac{10^3 \\times 10^{-12} \\times 10^{-6}}{10^{-6}} = 10^{3 - 12 - 6 + 6} = 10^{-9} $$\nThe force is therefore:\n$$ F_0 = 0.088125 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{N} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in picoNewtons (pN), where $1\\,\\mathrm{pN} = 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n$$ F_0 = 0.088125 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{N} = 88.125 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{N} = 88.125\\,\\mathrm{pN} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the final result is $88.1\\,\\mathrm{pN}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{88.1}$$", "id": "2656522"}]}
