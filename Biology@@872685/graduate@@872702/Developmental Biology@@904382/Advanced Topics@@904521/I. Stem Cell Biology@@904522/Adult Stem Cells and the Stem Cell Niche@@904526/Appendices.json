This exercise guides you through building a foundational model of stem cell population dynamics from first principles [@problem_id:2617075]. By translating the core processes of self-renewal, differentiation, and loss into a simple differential equation, you will discover how a critical balance between these fates determines whether a stem cell pool expands or contracts.", "problem": "In an adult epithelial tissue, each stem cell resides in a local microenvironment (the niche) that maintains a balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Consider the following mechanistic assumptions grounded in standard stem-cell fate modeling. Each stem cell divides at a per-capita rate $r$ (units: $\\text{time}^{-1}$). Upon division, each of the two daughter cells independently self-renews into a stem cell with probability $s \\in [0,1]$ and differentiates into a non-stem cell with probability $1-s$. Thus, the expected number of stem-cell daughters per division is $2s$. Additionally, stem cells are lost through niche exit or death at a per-capita rate $\\delta \\ge 0$ (units: $\\text{time}^{-1}$), independent of division. Let $S(t)$ denote the expected number of stem cells at time $t$.\n\nUsing only these definitions and standard expectation arguments, first derive the ordinary differential equation for $S(t)$ implied by this fate process. Then, treating that differential equation as exact, solve for the general solution $S(t)$ given an initial condition $S(0) = S_0 > 0$, identify the steady states, and classify their stability by parameter regime. Finally, determine the critical self-renewal probability $s_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ that separates long-term decline from long-term growth (i.e., the value of $s$ at which the population is marginally stable).\n\nYour final answer must be the closed-form analytic expression for $s_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ in terms of $r$ and $\\delta$.

The assumptions provided are mechanistic and form a simplified but scientifically sound basis for modeling stem cell population dynamics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and an initial condition to derive and solve a differential equation. The terminology is precise and objective. There are no violations of scientific principles, logical contradictions, or ambiguities. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe primary task is to construct an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the expected number of stem cells, $S(t)$. We model the rate of change of $S(t)$, denoted $\\frac{dS}{dt}$, by accounting for all processes that increase or decrease the stem cell population.\n\nThe change in the expected number of stem cells is the sum of the expected rates of production and loss.\n1.  **Change due to cell division:** The total rate at which divisions occur in a population of size $S(t)$ is $rS(t)$. Each division event involves one parent stem cell, which is consumed, and the production of two daughter cells. Each daughter cell becomes a stem cell with probability $s$. Therefore, the expected number of new stem cells created per division is $2s$. The net change in the number of stem cells from one division event is the number of new stem cells created minus the one parent stem cell that was lost: $2s - 1$. The total rate of change in the stem cell population due to division is the product of the rate of divisions and the net change per division:\n    $$\n    \\text{Rate of change from division} = (2s - 1) \\cdot rS(t)\n    $$\n2.  **Change due to cell loss:** Stem cells are lost through processes independent of division at a per-capita rate $\\delta$. For a population of size $S(t)$, the total rate of loss is:\n    $$\n    \\text{Rate of change from loss} = -\\delta S(t)\n    $$\n\nCombining these two rates gives the total rate of change for the expected stem cell population, $S(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = r(2s - 1)S(t) - \\delta S(t)\n$$\nThis equation can be simplified by factoring out $S(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\left[ r(2s - 1) - \\delta \\right] S(t)\n$$\nThis is the required first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. For convenience, let the constant term $\\lambda = r(2s - 1) - \\delta$. The ODE becomes $\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\lambda S(t)$.\n\nNext, we solve this ODE with the initial condition $S(0) = S_0$. This is a separable equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{S} = \\lambda dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial state $(0, S_0)$ to a state $(t, S(t))$:\n$$\n\\int_{S_0}^{S(t)} \\frac{1}{S'} dS' = \\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda dt'\n$$\n$$\n[\\ln|S'|]_{S_0}^{S(t)} = [\\lambda t']_{0}^{t}\n$$\nSince $S(t)$ represents a population, $S(t) > 0$. Therefore, $\\ln(S(t)) - \\ln(S_0) = \\lambda t$.\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{S(t)}{S_0}\\right) = \\lambda t\n$$\nSolving for $S(t)$ by exponentiating both sides yields the general solution:\n$$\nS(t) = S_0 \\exp(\\lambda t) = S_0 \\exp\\left( \\left[ r(2s - 1) - \\delta \\right] t \\right)\n$$\n\nNow, we identify the steady states and their stability. A steady state, $S^*$, is a value of $S$ for which $\\frac{dS}{dt} = 0$.\n$$\n\\left[ r(2s - 1) - \\delta \\right] S^* = 0\n$$\nThe only solution is $S^* = 0$, which represents population extinction. The stability of this steady state is determined by the sign of the exponent $\\lambda = r(2s - 1) - \\delta$.\n- If $\\lambda < 0$, then $S(t) \\to 0$ as $t \\to \\infty$. The population declines to extinction. The steady state $S^*=0$ is **stable**. This occurs when $s < \\frac{r+\\delta}{2r}$.\n- If $\\lambda > 0$, then $S(t) \\to \\infty$ as $t \\to \\infty$ (assuming $S_0 > 0$). The population grows exponentially. The steady state $S^*=0$ is **unstable**. This occurs when $s > \\frac{r+\\delta}{2r}$.\n- If $\\lambda = 0$, then $S(t) = S_0$ for all $t$. The population size remains constant. This is a case of **marginal stability**, where a line of non-isolated fixed points exists.\n\nThe critical self-renewal probability, $s_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, is defined as the value of $s$ that separates long-term decline from long-term growth. This corresponds to the case of marginal stability, where the net growth rate is zero.\n$$\n\\lambda = r(2s_{\\mathrm{crit}} - 1) - \\delta = 0\n$$\nWe solve this equation for $s_{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$\nr(2s_{\\mathrm{crit}} - 1) = \\delta\n$$\n$$\n2s_{\\mathrm{crit}} - 1 = \\frac{\\delta}{r}\n$$\n$$\n2s_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 1 + \\frac{\\delta}{r}\n$$\n$$\n2s_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{r + \\delta}{r}\n$$\n$$\ns_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{r + \\delta}{2r}\n$$\nThis expression provides the critical threshold for the self-renewal probability. If $s > s_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, the stem cell population expands. If $s < s_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, it contracts toward extinction. If $s = s_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, it is maintained at its initial size.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{r+\\delta}{2r}}$$", "id": "2617075"}, {"introduction": "While stem cells are essential, they are often rare.

Consider a tissue at homeostasis with a fixed total cellularity of $T$ cells (including adult stem cells, transit-amplifying progenitors, and terminally differentiated cells).

It presents a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective scenario for modeling tissue homeostasis based on the principle of flux balance, which is a standard and robust method in quantitative biology. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this system is the steady-state condition. For the tissue to maintain homeostasis with a fixed total cellularity $T$, the rate of production of terminally differentiated cells must equal their rate of loss.\n\nFirst, we identify the total rate of loss of terminally differentiated cells. The problem explicitly states this as the daily turnover, $N$ cells per day.\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Loss} = N\n$$\nNext, we derive the total rate of production of terminally differentiated cells. The total number of adult stem cells in the tissue, let us call it $S_c$, is defined as the fraction $f$ of the total tissue cellularity $T$.\n$$\nS_c = fT\n$$\nEach of these stem cells divides at a given per-capita rate $r$ per day. Therefore, the total number of stem cell division events occurring across the entire stem cell pool per day is the product of the number of stem cells and their per-capita division rate.\n$$\n\\text{Total Stem Cell Divisions per Day} = S_c \\times r = (fT)r\n$$\nThe problem states that each stem cell division seeds, on average, a single ($1$) transit-amplifying progenitor lineage. This lineage undergoes a series of divisions and differentiations, ultimately producing an expected number of $A$ terminally differentiated cells. The quantity $A$ thus represents the amplification factor, which is the total number of terminally differentiated cells generated per initial stem cell division.\n\nTo calculate the total rate of production of terminally differentiated cells, we multiply the total rate of stem cell divisions by the amplification factor $A$.\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Production} = (\\text{Total Stem Cell Divisions per Day}) \\times A = ((fT)r)A = frTA\n$$\nFor the system to be at a steady-state (homeostasis), the rate of production must balance the rate of loss.

To sustain the tissue, the production rate must be at least equal to the loss rate, which implies $frTA \\ge N$. The problem asks for the minimal required stem cell fraction, denoted $f^{\\ast}$, that can sustain the turnover $N$.
