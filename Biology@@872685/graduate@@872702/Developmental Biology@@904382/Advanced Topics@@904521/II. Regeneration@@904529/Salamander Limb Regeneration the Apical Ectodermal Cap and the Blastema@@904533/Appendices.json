The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique, physically meaningful solution. The validation process confirms its validity, so we may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe governing equation for the steady-state concentration profile $C(x)$ of Fibroblast Growth Factor $8$ (FGF$8$) is given as:\n$$D\\,\\frac{d^{2}C}{dx^{2}}-\\lambda\\,C+J\\,\\delta(x)=0$$\nHere, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $\\lambda$ is the linear clearance rate constant, $J$ is the source strength at the plane $x=0$, and $\\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta distribution. The boundary conditions are that the concentration $C(x)$ must vanish far from the source, i.e., $C(x) \\to 0$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$.\n\nFirst, we solve the equation in the regions where the source term is zero, that is, for $x \\neq 0$. In these regions, the governing equation simplifies to the homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$D\\,\\frac{d^{2}C}{dx^{2}}-\\lambda\\,C=0$$\nor\n$$\\frac{d^{2}C}{dx^{2}} - \\frac{\\lambda}{D}C=0$$\nThis is a second-order ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. We seek solutions of the form $C(x) = \\exp(rx)$. Substituting this into the equation yields the characteristic equation:\n$$r^{2} - \\frac{\\lambda}{D} = 0$$\nThe roots are $r = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{D}}$. It is convenient to define a characteristic length scale, $L = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\lambda}}$. The roots are then $r = \\pm \\frac{1}{L}$. The general solution for $x \\neq 0$ is a linear combination of the two fundamental solutions:\n$$C(x) = A\\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{L}\\right) + B\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L}\\right)$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants.\n\nWe must now apply the boundary conditions. The condition $C(x) \\to 0$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$ must be applied separately for the two regions $x>0$ and $x<0$.\n\nFor the region $x > 0$, as $x \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp(x/L)$ grows without bound. To satisfy the boundary condition, its coefficient must be zero. Thus, for $x > 0$, the solution takes the form:\n$$C(x) = B_{1}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L}\\right)$$\nFor the region $x < 0$, as $x \\to -\\infty$, the term $\\exp(-x/L)$ grows without bound. Consequently, its coefficient must be zero. Thus, for $x < 0$, the solution takes the form:\n$$C(x) = A_{2}\\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{L}\\right)$$\nHere, $B_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are constants to be determined.\n\nNext, we establish the conditions at the source, $x=0$.\nThe physical nature of concentration requires that $C(x)$ be continuous at $x=0$. An infinite concentration is not physical, and this is reinforced by the problem statement that $C(x)$ is finite at $x=0$. Therefore, the limit of $C(x)$ as $x$ approaches $0$ from the right must equal the limit as $x$ approaches $0$ from the left:\n$$C(0^{+}) = C(0^{-})$$\nApplying this condition to our piecewise solutions:\n$$B_{1}\\exp(0) = A_{2}\\exp(0) \\implies B_{1} = A_{2}$$\nLet us denote this common constant by $A$.

The proliferation rate is given by the relation $r = r_{\\max} p$, where $p$ is the fraction of occupied receptors. Thus, the primary task is to derive an expression for $p$ in terms of the given parameters $C$ and $K_{d}$.\n\nThe fraction of occupied receptors is defined as:\n$$ p = \\dfrac{[LR]}{R_{T}} $$\nThe total receptor concentration is given by the sum of free and ligand-bound receptors:\n$$ R_{T} = [R] + [LR] $$\nFrom this, we can express the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$, as:\n$$ [R] = R_{T} - [LR] $$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_{d}$, is defined at equilibrium by the law of mass action:\n$$ K_{d} = \\dfrac{[L][R]}{[LR]} $$\nThe problem states that the extracellular ligand concentration $C$ is equal to the free ligand concentration $[L]$, i.e., $C = [L]$.
