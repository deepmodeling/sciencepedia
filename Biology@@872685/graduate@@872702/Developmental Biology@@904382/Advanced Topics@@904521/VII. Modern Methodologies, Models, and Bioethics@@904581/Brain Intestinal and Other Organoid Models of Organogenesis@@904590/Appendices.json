Oxygen is supplied from the culture medium at the organoid surface, where the dissolved oxygen concentration is held at $c_{0}$ by fast external transport. Inside the organoid there is no convection, and oxygen diffuses with molecular diffusivity $D$ through a homogeneous cellular matrix that consumes oxygen at a uniform, zero-order volumetric rate $q$ (moles per unit volume per unit time), reflecting saturating intracellular kinetics at the operating concentrations.

The derivation must begin from Fick's first law and the principle of mass conservation at steady state.\n\nWe begin with the general differential mass balance for a species with concentration $c$ in a control volume:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} + S\n$$\nHere, $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t}$ is the rate of accumulation of the species, $\\mathbf{J}$ is the molar flux vector, and $S$ is the net rate of generation per unit volume.\n\nThe problem specifies several conditions:\n1.  **Quasi-steady state:** The system does not change in time, so the accumulation term is zero: $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n2.  **Fick's first law:** The flux $\\mathbf{J}$ is due to diffusion and is given by $\\mathbf{J} = -D \\nabla c$, where $D$ is the molecular diffusivity, assumed to be constant.\n3.  **Zero-order consumption:** Oxygen is consumed at a uniform rate $q$. This corresponds to a sink term $S = -q$.\n\nSubstituting these conditions into the mass balance equation yields:\n$$\n0 = -\\nabla \\cdot (-D \\nabla c) - q\n$$\nAssuming the diffusivity $D$ is a constant, we can move it outside the divergence operator:\n$$\n0 = D (\\nabla \\cdot \\nabla c) - q\n$$\nThis simplifies to the Poisson equation for reaction-diffusion:\n$$\nD \\nabla^2 c = q\n$$\n\nThe problem states the organoid is spherical and we can assume spherical symmetry. Therefore, the concentration $c$ is a function only of the radial coordinate $r$, i.e., $c = c(r)$. In spherical coordinates, the Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2$ acting on a function of only $r$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 c = \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into our governing equation gives the ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the concentration profile:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{r^2}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr}\\right) = q\n$$\n\nTo solve this ODE for $c(r)$, we integrate with respect to $r$. First, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr}\\right) = \\frac{q}{D} r^2\n$$\nIntegrating once with respect to $r$ gives:\n$$\nr^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} = \\int \\frac{q}{D} r^2 \\, dr = \\frac{q}{3D} r^3 + C_1\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ is the first integration constant. To find $C_1$, we apply a boundary condition at the center of the sphere, $r=0$. Due to spherical symmetry, the concentration profile must be smooth at the center, meaning the concentration gradient must be zero. A non-zero gradient would imply a physically impossible source or sink at the origin. This is the regularity condition.\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{dc}{dr} \\right|_{r=0} = 0\n$$\nTo apply this, we first solve for the gradient $\\frac{dc}{dr}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dr} = \\frac{q}{3D} r + \\frac{C_1}{r^2}\n$$\nAt $r=0$, the term $\\frac{C_1}{r^2}$ is singular unless $C_1=0$. Therefore, we must have $C_1=0$.\nThe gradient expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dr} = \\frac{q}{3D} r\n$$\nNow, we integrate a second time to find the concentration profile $c(r)$:\n$$\nc(r) = \\int \\frac{q}{3D} r \\, dr = \\frac{q}{6D} r^2 + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second integration constant.\n\nWe now use the specific conditions for the critical radius $R_{\\max}$. This radius is defined as the size where the center just becomes anoxic. This provides two boundary conditions for our specific case:\n1.  At the center, $r=0$, the concentration is zero: $c(0) = 0$.\n2.  At the surface, $r=R_{\\max}$, the concentration is maintained at $c_0$: $c(R_{\\max}) = c_0$.\n\nUsing the first condition, $c(0)=0$:\n$$\nc(0) = \\frac{q}{6D} (0)^2 + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0\n$$\nThus, the concentration profile for an organoid with an anoxic core is:\n$$\nc(r) = \\frac{q}{6D} r^2\n$$\nNow, we apply the second condition at the surface $r=R_{\\max}$:\n$$\nc(R_{\\max}) = c_0\n$$\nSubstituting $r=R_{\\max}$ into the concentration profile yields:\n$$\nc_0 = \\frac{q}{6D} R_{\\max}^2\n$$\nFinally, we solve for the maximum radius, $R_{\\max}$, by rearranging the equation:\n$$\nR_{\\max}^2 = \\frac{6 D c_0}{q}\n$$\nTaking the square root, and noting that a radius must be positive, we obtain the final expression:\n$$\nR_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6 D c_0}{q}}\n$$\nThis expression represents the largest possible radius a spherical tissue can have before a region of complete oxygen deprivation (anoxia) develops at its center, under the specified model conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{6 D c_{0}}{q}}}$$", "id": "2622583"}, {"introduction": "Beyond physical limits, the architecture of an organoid is determined by the dynamic balance of cell proliferation, differentiation, and loss.

The analysis must be grounded in the provided biophysical and molecular principles.\n\n1.  Analysis of Lumenization Efficiency\nLumen formation in an epithelial spheroid is a process of cavitation driven by fluid accumulation. Apically-localized ion pumps transport ions into the nascent lumenal space, creating an osmotic gradient that draws water in. This generates an internal hydraulic pressure, $P_{lumen}$. For the lumen to expand, this pressure must overcome the mechanical resistance of the surrounding epithelial layer and the external hydrogel matrix. The mechanical stress exerted by the expanding lumen on the matrix is opposed by the matrix's elastic restoring force, which is proportional to its elastic modulus, $E$.\n\nAccording to the theory of elasticity for a spherical cavity in an infinite elastic medium, the resistance to expansion scales with the shear modulus, which is directly related to the Young's modulus $E$. A higher matrix stiffness ($E \\approx 3\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$) presents a significantly greater mechanical barrier to expansion than a lower stiffness ($E \\approx 0.3\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$). If the pressure $P_{lumen}$ generated by the cells is insufficient to overcome this resistance, lumen expansion will fail or be incomplete, resulting in multiple small, disconnected proto-lumens or no lumen at all. Therefore, the softer matrix with $E \\approx 0.3\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$ facilitates lumen expansion by offering lower mechanical resistance. This directly leads to a prediction of **higher lumenization efficiency in the softer ($0.3\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$) matrix**.\n\n2.  Analysis of Crypt Budding Frequency\nCrypt budding is a complex morphogenetic event involving localized proliferation, cell rearrangement, and changes in cell shape, leading to the evagination of crypt-like structures. This process is regulated by signaling pathways that control the balance between proliferation and differentiation. The problem statement specifically directs us to consider the role of YAP/TAZ signaling.\n\nYAP and TAZ are mechanosensitive transcriptional co-activators. Their activity is regulated by matrix stiffness as follows:\n- **Stiff Matrix ($E \\approx 3\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$):** High matrix stiffness promotes the formation of focal adhesions and increases cytoskeletal tension. This tension inhibits the LATS1/2 kinases, allowing YAP/TAZ to remain unphosphorylated, translocate to the nucleus, and promote the expression of target genes. Nuclear YAP/TAZ signaling is strongly associated with cell proliferation and an undifferentiated state, while it generally acts as an inhibitor of complex differentiation and morphogenesis programs.\n- **Soft Matrix ($E \\approx 0.3\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$):** Low matrix stiffness results in lower cytoskeletal tension. This activates the LATS1/2 kinases, which phosphorylate YAP/TAZ. Phosphorylated YAP/TAZ is retained in the cytoplasm and targeted for degradation. The resulting attenuation of nuclear YAP/TAZ signaling relieves its inhibitory effect on differentiation, permitting cells to execute complex morphogenetic programs.\n\nCrypt budding is a key feature of intestinal epithelial differentiation and organization. Therefore, the reduced nuclear YAP/TAZ activity in the softer matrix is expected to favor this process. This leads to a prediction of **higher crypt budding frequency in the softer ($0.3\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$) matrix**.\n\nCombining the two analyses, the theoretical prediction is that the softer matrix ($E \\approx 0.3\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$) will exhibit both higher lumenization efficiency and higher crypt budding frequency compared to the stiffer matrix ($E \\approx 3\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$).\n\nEvaluation of Options\n\nA. The softer matrix with $E \\approx 0.3\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$ yields higher lumenization efficiency and higher crypt budding frequency than the stiffer matrix with $E \\approx 3\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$, because lower matrix elastic resistance reduces the pressure threshold for lumen expansion and attenuates nuclear YAP/TAZ, favoring differentiation and morphogenesis.\n- This option correctly predicts that both lumenization efficiency and crypt budding frequency will be higher in the softer matrix.\n- The rationale provided is precise and mechanistically correct according to the derivation above. It correctly links lower resistance to improved lumenization and attenuated nuclear YAP/TAZ to enhanced morphogenesis (budding).\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. The stiffer matrix with $E \\approx 3\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$ yields higher lumenization efficiency and higher crypt budding frequency, because greater external resistance stabilizes lumen shape and amplifies integrin signaling required for morphogenesis.\n- The prediction that the stiffer matrix is superior for both metrics is contrary to our derivation.\n- The rationale is flawed. While some minimal resistance might be needed, the high resistance of the $3\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$ matrix is inhibitory, not stabilizing, for lumen expansion. Furthermore, while integrin signaling is amplified, this leads to high nuclear YAP/TAZ, which inhibits, rather than promotes, the differentiation required for crypt budding.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Lumenization efficiency is higher in the stiffer matrix with $E \\approx 3\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$ due to improved sealing and fluid retention, whereas crypt budding frequency is higher in the softer matrix with $E \\approx 0.3\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$ due to reduced nuclear YAP/TAZ.\n- This option presents a mixed outcome. The prediction for crypt budding is correct, as is its rationale.\n- However, the prediction that lumenization efficiency is higher in the stiffer matrix is incorrect. The dominant effect of high stiffness is mechanical impedance to expansion, not improved sealing, which is a property of cell-cell junctions.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. There is no significant difference between the two conditions, because ligand density is identical and growth factors are unchanged.\n- This option incorrectly dismisses the role of mechanics. The problem is explicitly designed to test the effect of mechanical cues (stiffness), which are transduced by cells independently of soluble factors or ligand density (when above a saturating threshold). The premise that constant ligand density and growth factors would negate the effect of a ten-fold change in stiffness is fundamentally wrong in the context of mechanobiology.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. The softer matrix with $E \\approx 0.3\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$ yields higher lumenization efficiency but lower crypt budding frequency, because reduced stiffness limits traction forces necessary for crypt evagination despite facilitating lumen expansion.\n- This option also presents a mixed outcome. The prediction for lumenization efficiency is correct.\n- The prediction for crypt budding is incorrect based on the specified YAP/TAZ principle. While it is true that cells require a substrate capable of resisting traction forces to perform mechanical work, the YAP/TAZ pathway provides a more specific and dominant mechanism in this context. The problem directs analysis via YAP/TAZ, where lower stiffness is permissive for morphogenesis. Therefore, this rationale, while plausible in other contexts, contradicts the primary mechanism specified.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2622412"}]}
