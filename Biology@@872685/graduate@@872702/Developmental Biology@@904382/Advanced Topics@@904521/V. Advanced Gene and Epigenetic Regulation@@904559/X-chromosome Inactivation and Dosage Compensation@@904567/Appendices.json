Consider an early embryonic stage when each cell independently selects which parental X chromosome to inactivate by a molecularly stochastic process (for example, coating by X-inactive specific transcript and associated chromatin remodeling), after which the chosen inactive state is mitotically heritable. This heritable, cell-autonomous choice is the developmental basis for cellular mosaicism in XX individuals for X-linked alleles.\n\nLet $p \\in (0,1)$ denote the probability that a given cell inactivates the maternal X chromosome (that is, has maternal $X$ inactive, denoted maternal $X_{i}$).

It is a direct application of fundamental principles of probability theory to a simplified but valid model of a biological process, specifically X-chromosome inactivation. All necessary information is provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. Thus, the problem is valid, and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe task is to derive the variance of the fraction of cells with an inactivated maternal X chromosome, denoted $F_N$. We are given a sample of $N$ clonally unrelated cells, where the choice of X-chromosome inactivation for each cell is an independent and identically distributed stochastic event.\n\nLet us define an indicator random variable $X_i$ for each cell $i$, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$.\nLet $X_i = 1$ if cell $i$ inactivates the maternal X chromosome, and $X_i = 0$ otherwise (i.e., it inactivates the paternal X chromosome).\nThe problem states that the probability of maternal X-inactivation is $p$. Thus, for any cell $i$:\n$$P(X_i = 1) = p$$\n$$P(X_i = 0) = 1-p$$\nEach $X_i$ is therefore a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $p$. The given conditions state that the variables $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_N$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).\n\nFirst, we must determine the expectation and variance of a single such random variable, $X_i$.\nThe expectation, $E[X_i]$, is calculated as:\n$$E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i = 1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i = 0) = 1 \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1-p) = p$$\nThe variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(X_i)$, is given by the formula $\\mathrm{Var}(X_i) = E[X_i^2] - (E[X_i])^2$.\nTo find $E[X_i^2]$, we note that since $X_i$ can only be $0$ or $1$, $X_i^2$ is identical to $X_i$.\nTherefore, $E[X_i^2] = E[X_i] = p$.\nSubstituting this into the variance formula:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(X_i) = p - p^2 = p(1-p)$$\n\nThe random variable $F_N$ is defined as the *fraction* of cells in the sample with maternal X inactivation. Let $S_N$ be the total *number* of such cells. $S_N$ is the sum of the indicator variables:\n$$S_N = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$\nThe fraction $F_N$ is then related to $S_N$ and the total number of cells $N$ as:\n$$F_N = \\frac{S_N}{N} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$\n\nWe are required to find $\\mathrm{Var}(F_N)$. Using the properties of variance, specifically that $\\mathrm{Var}(aY) = a^2 \\mathrm{Var}(Y)$ for a constant $a$ and a random variable $Y$, we have:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(F_N) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{N} S_N\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(S_N) = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right)$$\n\nThe next step is to compute $\\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right)$. A critical property of variance is that for a sum of *independent* random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of their individual variances. The problem explicitly states that the XCI choices are independent. Therefore:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathrm{Var}(X_i)$$\nSince the variables $X_i$ are also identically distributed, their variances are equal: $\\mathrm{Var}(X_i) = p(1-p)$ for all $i$.\nThe sum of the variances is then:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathrm{Var}(X_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p(1-p) = Np(1-p)$$\nThis is the well-known variance of the binomial distribution, as $S_N$ is binomially distributed with parameters $N$ and $p$.\n\nFinally, we substitute this result back into the expression for $\\mathrm{Var}(F_N)$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(F_N) = \\frac{1}{N^2} [Np(1-p)]$$\nBy canceling a factor of $N$ from the numerator and denominator, we arrive at the final closed-form expression:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(F_N) = \\frac{p(1-p)}{N}$$\nThis result is the variance of the sample proportion, a fundamental quantity in statistical inference.

Early in development, each cell independently inactivates one X chromosome, and this choice is clonally stable. In this individual, nonrandom skewing yields that the X chromosome bearing the wild-type $G$ allele is active in a proportion $0.8$ of cells, while the X chromosome bearing the mutant $G$ allele is active in the remaining $0.2$ of cells. Assume that the mutant allele resides on the X chromosome that is active in a proportion $0.2$ of cells.\n\nThe gene $G$ partially escapes XCI in a cell-type specific manner as follows: in any cell where a given $G$ allele lies on the inactive X chromosome, with probability $e$ it is transcribed at a fraction $\\alpha$ of the level it would have if it were on the active X chromosome, and with probability $1-e$ it is fully silenced.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "We begin from the core definitions. X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) establishes a stable mosaic: each cell has one transcriptionally active X chromosome and one transcriptionally inactive X chromosome. For a heterozygous female, cells in which the mutant-bearing X chromosome is active will transcribe the mutant allele at full active-X level, while cells in which the mutant-bearing X is inactive will transcribe it only to the extent that the gene escapes XCI.\n\nLet $p$ denote the probability that, in a randomly chosen cell, the X chromosome carrying the mutant allele is the active X chromosome. By the problem’s skewing, we will later set $p = \\tfrac{1}{5}$, but we first proceed symbolically.\n\nDefine the detection threshold $\\delta$ for the mutant transcript relative to an active-X level. A cell is classified as “expressing the mutant allele” if and only if the mutant transcript level in that cell is at least $\\delta$ times the active-X level.\n\nWe model escape from XCI for gene $G$ as follows: if an allele lies on the inactive X chromosome, then with probability $e$ it is expressed at a fractional level $\\alpha$ (relative to an allele on the active X chromosome), and with probability $1-e$ it is not expressed ($0$).\n\nBy the law of total probability, the expected fraction of cells classified as “expressing the mutant allele” equals the probability that a randomly chosen cell meets the expression criterion. Partition on whether the mutant-bearing X is active:\n\n- With probability $p$, the mutant-bearing X is active. In such a cell, the mutant allele is expressed at full active-X level, which is $\\geq \\delta$ for any $\\delta \\leq 1$, and in particular for any $\\delta \\in (0,1]$ as is typical for a detection threshold. Therefore, conditional on the mutant-bearing X being active, the probability of being called “expressing the mutant allele” is $1$.\n\n- With probability $1-p$, the mutant-bearing X is inactive. In such a cell, the mutant allele is expressed at level $\\alpha$ with probability $e$ and at level $0$ with probability $1-e$. The expression criterion is met if and only if the realized mutant expression level is at least $\\delta$. Thus, the conditional probability that a cell in this category is called “expressing the mutant allele” is\n  $$\\Pr(\\text{expressing} \\mid \\text{mutant inactive}) \\,=\\, e \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\alpha \\geq \\delta\\}} \\,+\\, (1-e)\\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\{0 \\geq \\delta\\}},$$\n  where $\\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\,\\cdot\\,\\}}$ denotes the indicator function. Since $\\delta > 0$ by definition of a positive detection threshold, we have $\\mathbf{1}_{\\{0 \\geq \\delta\\}} = 0$, and the expression simplifies to\n  $$\\Pr(\\text{expressing} \\mid \\text{mutant inactive}) \\,=\\, e \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\alpha \\geq \\delta\\}}.$$\n\nCombining these cases using the law of total probability, the expected fraction of cells called “expressing the mutant allele” is\n$$\nF(p,e,\\alpha,\\delta) \\,=\\, p \\cdot 1 \\,+\\, (1-p)\\cdot e \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\alpha \\geq \\delta\\}} \\,=\\, p \\,+\\, (1-p)e\\,\\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\alpha \\geq \\delta\\}}.\n$$\n\nThis is the required symbolic expression.\n\nWe now evaluate with the given values $p = \\tfrac{1}{5}$, $e = \\tfrac{1}{2}$, $\\alpha = \\tfrac{1}{5}$, and $\\delta = \\tfrac{1}{10}$. Note that $\\alpha = \\tfrac{1}{5}$ and $\\delta = \\tfrac{1}{10}$ satisfy $\\alpha \\geq \\delta$, so $\\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\alpha \\geq \\delta\\}} = 1$.

A cell is phenotypically mutant if its functional dosage from the wild-type allele is below $\\tau = \\tfrac{3}{20}$. In cells where the mutant-bearing X is active (probability $p = \\tfrac{1}{5}$), the wild-type allele is on the inactive X. It escapes with probability $e = \\tfrac{1}{2}$, yielding functional dosage $\\alpha = \\tfrac{1}{5}$, or is fully silenced with probability $1-e = \\tfrac{1}{2}$, yielding dosage $0$. Since $\\alpha = \\tfrac{1}{5} = \\tfrac{4}{20}$ exceeds $\\tau = \\tfrac{3}{20}$, cells in which the wild-type allele escapes are phenotypically nonmutant, whereas those without escape are phenotypically mutant. Therefore, the fraction of phenotypically mutant cells among the $p$ fraction is $p(1-e) = \\tfrac{1}{5}\\cdot \\tfrac{1}{2} = \\tfrac{1}{10}$. In cells where the mutant-bearing X is inactive (probability $1-p = \\tfrac{4}{5}$), the wild-type allele is on the active X, giving functional dosage $1$, which is above $\\tau$, so these cells are phenotypically nonmutant. Hence, the expected mutant-phenotype fraction across the tissue is $\\tfrac{1}{10}$. By the law of large numbers, in a very large tissue this realized fraction will concentrate near $\\tfrac{1}{10}$, which is below the disease threshold $\\theta = \\tfrac{3}{10}$. Therefore, disease penetrance is not expected in a very large tissue under these parameters.\n\nThe required numerical result for the expected fraction of cells called “expressing the mutant allele” is the exact fraction $\\tfrac{3}{5}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$$", "id": "2687867"}, {"introduction": "This final practice challenges you to think like a clinical geneticist, integrating molecular principles to solve a complex diagnostic puzzle.

Assume the following widely accepted foundational facts as the base for your reasoning: in placental mammals, dosage compensation equalizes X-linked gene expression between XX and XY individuals by initiating XCI via the long non-coding RNA X-inactive specific transcript (*XIST*) expressed from the X-inactivation center at cytoband Xq13; genes in the pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) and a subset (approximately $15\\%$) of non-PAR X-linked genes escape XCI and are expressed from both X chromosomes; topological boundary elements such as the macrosatellite distal X-zinc finger protein *4* (*DXZ4*) help partition the inactive X into megadomains that constrain the spread of silencing and shape escape domains; and structural abnormalities that remove *XIST* typically prevent that chromosome from becoming the inactive X, predisposing to functional disomy for genes retained on the abnormal chromosome.\n\nConsider a female embryo with karyotype mosaicism comprising lineages $46$,X,r(X) and $45$,X in proportions near $70\\%$ and $30\\%$, respectively. The ring X is mitotically stable in the $46$,X,r(X) lineage. Four independent ring configurations (A–D) are theorized, each differing in which segments of the X chromosome are captured by the ring:\n\n- Configuration A: The ring includes Xq13 containing *XIST* and Xq23 containing *DXZ4*, but lacks the entire pseudoautosomal region $1$ (PAR$1$) on Xp, including short stature homeobox (SHOX). Most of Xp distal to Xp11 is absent from the ring.\n- Configuration B: The ring lacks Xq13 (no *XIST*) but includes Xp11.3–Xp11.2 with lysine demethylase $5$C (KDM5C) and Xq28 with methyl-CpG-binding protein $2$ (MECP2); PAR$1$ is absent.\n- Configuration C: The ring includes Xq13 with *XIST* and most of Xp including PAR$1$ (*SHOX* retained) but lacks the *DXZ4* macrosatellite at Xq23; no large duplications or deletions of dosage-critical distal Xq genes beyond the *DXZ4* loss are present.\n- Configuration D: The ring lacks Xq13 (no *XIST*) and contains only a minimal Xp telomeric segment encompassing PAR$1$ with *SHOX* and a few adjacent PAR$1$ genes; no other X-linked genes are present on the ring.\n\nUsing only the foundational facts stated above, for each configuration predict the most likely pattern of XCI choice and maintenance in the $46$,X,r(X) lineage, the expected behavior of escape domains on the ring, and the most plausible clinical phenotype.

Configuration B cannot undergo XCI because it lacks *XIST*; XCI will therefore occur on the normal X, leaving the ring active.

The facts themselves are internally consistent.

It presents a valid challenge in applying fundamental principles of medical genetics. Therefore, a full analysis is warranted.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe problem requires predicting the most likely XCI pattern and clinical phenotype for each of four theoretical ring X chromosome configurations in a mosaic $46$,X,r(X)/$45$,X individual. The analysis will be conducted by applying the provided foundational facts to each configuration.\n\n**Analysis of Configuration A**\n- The ring contains *XIST* at $Xq13$. According to foundational fact $2$, it is capable of initiating XCI. Structurally abnormal X chromosomes are typically preferentially inactivated to maintain genetic balance. Thus, the ring X will be preferentially chosen as the inactive X chromosome ($X_i$).\n- The ring lacks PAR$1$, including the *SHOX* gene. The $46$,X,r(X) cell line will therefore be haploinsufficient for *SHOX* and other genes in the deleted portion of Xp.\n- The clinical consequence of *SHOX* haploinsufficiency is short stature. The $30\\%$ $45$,X cell line also contributes to a Turner syndrome-like phenotype, including short stature. Therefore, growth abnormalities are an expected and prominent feature of the phenotype.\n\n**Analysis of Configuration B**\n- The ring lacks *XIST* at $Xq13$. According to foundational facts $2$ and $5$, this chromosome cannot be inactivated.\n- To achieve dosage compensation, the cell must inactivate the other X chromosome, which is the normal X. This results in a non-random or skewed XCI pattern where the normal X is always the $X_i$.\n- Foundational fact $5$ explicitly states that this scenario predisposes to \"functional disomy for genes retained on the abnormal chromosome.\" This means that genes present on the active ring X, such as *KDM5C* and *MECP2*, will be overexpressed in the $70\\%$ $46$,X,r(X) cell lineage.\n- Clinically, functional disomy for *MECP2* is the cause of *MECP2* duplication syndrome, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by infantile hypotonia, intellectual disability, and recurrent infections.\n- Additionally, the ring lacks PAR$1$, and the mosaic $45$,X lineage is present. Both factors result in haploinsufficiency for PAR$1$ genes like *SHOX*, leading to features of Turner syndrome, such as short stature.\n- The overall phenotype is therefore predicted to be a combination of a severe neurodevelopmental disorder due to gene duplication on the ring, superimposed on features of Turner syndrome.\n\n**Analysis of Configuration C**\n- The ring contains *XIST* at $Xq13$ and will likely be preferentially inactivated.\n- The ring lacks the *DXZ4* macrosatellite. Foundational fact $4$ states that *DXZ4* helps \"partition the inactive X into megadomains\" and \"shape escape domains.\" Its loss would be expected to disrupt the structure of the inactive X and potentially alter the expression of genes that normally escape XCI. It is plausible this could lead to increased silencing of escape genes.\n- A prediction of \"global\" elimination of escape domains and consequent lethality is an extreme and not strictly necessary conclusion from the provided premise. The premise states *DXZ4* \"helps\" to shape domains, implying its absence would be disruptive, but not necessarily catastrophic in all cases.\n\n**Analysis of Configuration D**\n- The ring lacks *XIST* and cannot be inactivated. The normal X will be inactivated. The ring, containing only PAR$1$ genes, remains active.\n- Let us calculate the gene dosage for *SHOX* in the $46$,X,r(X) lineage. In these cells, the normal X is inactive ($X_i$) and the ring X is active ($X_a$).\n- According to foundational fact $3$, PAR$1$ genes (including *SHOX*) escape XCI. Therefore, the *SHOX* gene on the normal $X_i$ is expressed. This provides one active copy.\n- The ring X is active, so its *SHOX* gene is also expressed. This provides a second active copy.\n- The total number of active *SHOX* copies in the $46$,X,r(X) lineage is $1+1=2$. This is the normal dosage for both $XX$ and $XY$ individuals.\n- In the $30\\%$ $45$,X lineage, there is only one X chromosome, and thus only one copy of *SHOX*.\n- The composite gene dosage for the individual is an average across the two lineages: $(0.70 \\times 2) + (0.30 \\times 1) = 1.4 + 0.3 = 1.7$ copies.\n- Since the normal dose is $2$ copies, an average of $1.7$ copies represents a state of haploinsufficiency, which is expected to cause short stature, not tall stature. The claim of \"triplosensitivity\" (implying $3$ active copies) is factually incorrect based on the provided principles.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Configuration A will be preferentially chosen as the inactive X due to the presence of *XIST*; because the ring geometry compacts chromatin, genes that normally escape XCI will be largely silenced on the ring, so escape gene dosage will be reduced to a single active copy. Clinically, the phenotype will be limited to mild cognitive impairment without growth abnormalities.**\nThe reasoning regarding XCI choice and potential silencing of escape genes is plausible. However, the clinical prediction is flawed. Configuration A lacks PAR$1$, including *SHOX*. Both the $46$,X,r(X) lineage and the $45$,X lineage are consequently haploinsufficient for *SHOX*. This will unequivocally lead to short stature, which is a significant growth abnormality. The statement \"without growth abnormalities\" is a direct contradiction of the genetic facts.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Configuration B cannot undergo XCI because it lacks *XIST*; XCI will therefore occur on the normal X, leaving the ring active. This results in functional disomy for *KDM5C* and *MECP2* in the $46$,X,r(X) lineage, predicting a severe neurodevelopmental phenotype consistent with *MECP2* duplication effects (hypotonia, intellectual disability, recurrent infections), along with features of PAR$1$ haploinsufficiency (e.g., short stature) mitigated or accentuated by the $45$,X mosaic lineage.**\nThis option correctly applies foundational facts $2$ and $5$: lack of *XIST* prevents ring inactivation and forces inactivation of the normal X, which \"predispos[es] to functional disomy for genes retained on the abnormal chromosome\" (*KDM5C*, *MECP2*). The predicted severe neurodevelopmental phenotype is the known consequence of *MECP2* duplication. It also correctly identifies that PAR$1$ haploinsufficiency (from the ring's deletion and the $45$,X line) will cause features like short stature. Every part of this statement is a direct and logical consequence of the provided premises.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Configuration C will be stably inactivated due to the presence of *XIST*; loss of *DXZ4* eliminates escape domains globally, causing silencing of all escape genes on the inactive ring and thereby reducing their total dosage. Clinically, this will produce profound multi-organ failure incompatible with postnatal survival.**\nWhile loss of *DXZ4* is expected to disrupt escape domains, the claim that it \"eliminates [them] globally\" is an overstatement not fully supported by the milder premise that *DXZ4* \"helps\" shape them. Furthermore, predicting a specific outcome as severe as \"profound multi-organ failure incompatible with postnatal survival\" is an extreme extrapolation. While dysfunction of escape genes is pathogenic, this specific prediction is not a necessary consequence and is less certain than the predictions in option B.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Configuration D will not be inactivated because it lacks *XIST*; however, because it carries only PAR$1$ genes, escape domain behavior is irrelevant, and the net effect is beneficial triplosensitivity for *SHOX* leading to tall stature and otherwise normal development, despite the $45$,X mosaic lineage.**\nThe primary flaw is the claim of \"triplosensitivity for *SHOX*.\" As derived above, the $46$,X,r(X) cells would have two active copies of *SHOX*, and the $45$,X cells would have one. The average dosage of $1.7$ copies is less than the normal two, predicting short stature, not tall stature. The reasoning regarding gene dosage is mathematically incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2687859"}]}
