{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A central goal in studying developmental plasticity is to quantify the relationship between an environmental cue and a phenotypic outcome. For discrete polyphenisms, this relationship often takes the form of a sharp, switch-like threshold. This exercise [@problem_id:2630130] challenges you to model such a switch, which is induced by a hormone, by fitting a Hill function to dose-response data. Mastering this approach allows you to translate raw experimental counts into biologically meaningful parameters: the concentration for half-maximal response ($K$) and the cooperativity or steepness of the switch ($n$).", "problem": "An endocrine manipulation experiment measures the fraction of individuals expressing a discrete alternative morph (denoted B-morph) in response to exogenous concentrations of a single hormone. Developmental plasticity in this system is plausibly mediated by receptor-mediated signaling with potential cooperativity, yielding a monotonic, saturating, switch-like mapping from hormone concentration to the probability of the B-morph. Assume the following foundational bases: (i) ligand-receptor binding follows mass action, (ii) cooperative binding can be summarized by a single Hill-type parameter controlling steepness, and (iii) each individual’s morph outcome is a Bernoulli trial, so counts at a fixed dose arise from a Binomial sampling process. Use these bases to construct a parametric, normalized, monotonic dose-response function with lower asymptote $0$, upper asymptote $1$, a half-activation concentration $K$ (in nanomolar, nM) where the response equals $0.5$, and a steepness parameter $n$ (dimensionless) that controls how sharp the switch is around $K$. Fit $K$ and $n$ by maximizing the Binomial likelihood given the data below.\n\nData are provided as dose-response datasets, each listing hormone concentrations (in nanomolar, nM), the number of B-morph individuals (successes), and the total number of individuals assayed at that dose. Probabilities must be treated as decimals, not as percentages.\n\nFor numerical stability, your algorithm must ensure that the model-predicted probability at any dose is strictly between $0$ and $1$. If needed, apply a small numerical offset $\\epsilon$ with $0 < \\epsilon \\ll 1$ to avoid evaluating logarithms at $0$ or $1$ during likelihood computations.\n\nTest suite (four datasets covering typical, shallow, sharp, and small-sample regimes):\n- Dataset A (typical steep switch):\n  - Concentrations [nM]: $[0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50]$\n  - Successes: $[0, 1, 6, 50, 89, 98, 100]$\n  - Totals: $[100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100]$\n- Dataset B (shallow switch):\n  - Concentrations [nM]: $[1, 3, 10, 30, 100]$\n  - Successes: $[18, 46, 100, 150, 182]$\n  - Totals: $[200, 200, 200, 200, 200]$\n- Dataset C (very sharp switch):\n  - Concentrations [nM]: $[4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48]$\n  - Successes: $[0, 12, 75, 127, 148, 150]$\n  - Totals: $[150, 150, 150, 150, 150, 150]$\n- Dataset D (small-sample coverage):\n  - Concentrations [nM]: $[0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8]$\n  - Successes: $[0, 1, 4, 10, 16, 19]$\n  - Totals: $[20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20]$\n\nTasks:\n1. Construct a likelihood under a Binomial sampling model for morph counts at each dose, given a two-parameter Hill-type switch characterized by $K$ (in nM) and $n$ (dimensionless), with the constraints that $K > 0$ and $n > 0$.\n2. Implement a numerical optimization routine to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of $K$ and $n$ for each dataset. Use multiple starting values or a reparameterization to reasonably mitigate local optima.\n3. Biological interpretation requirement (reported in your solution explanation, not in the program’s output): Interpret $K$ as the concentration for half-maximal probability and $n$ as a measure of switch sharpness (cooperativity), relating larger $n$ to a more abrupt transition and higher local sensitivity around $K$.\n\nAngle units are not applicable. Physical units: All concentrations are in nanomolar (nM), and you must report $K$ in nM. The steepness parameter $n$ is dimensionless. Report probabilities as decimals.

A solution will be furnished.\n\n---\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to estimate the parameters of a dose-response model from experimental data. This is a problem of statistical inference, which we will solve using the method of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).\n\n**1. Dose-Response Model Formulation**\n\nThe problem requires a sigmoidal dose-response curve that maps hormone concentration, $C$, to the probability, $P$, of an individual developing the B-morph. The function must have a lower asymptote of $0$, an upper asymptote of $1$, a half-maximal concentration $K$, and a cooperativity parameter $n$. The standard Hill equation satisfies these requirements precisely:\n$$ P(C; K, n) = \\frac{C^n}{K^n + C^n} $$\nThis can be rewritten in a numerically preferable form that mitigates potential overflow issues with large $C$ or $K$:\n$$ P(C; K, n) = \\frac{(C/K)^n}{1 + (C/K)^n} $$\nIn this model, $K$ represents the concentration at which the probability is $0.5$, as $P(K; K, n) = \\frac{(K/K)^n}{1 + (K/K)^n} = \\frac{1^n}{1+1^n} = \\frac{1}{2}$. The parameter $n$, the Hill coefficient, controls the steepness of the switch-like response.\n\n**2. Likelihood Function**\n\nThe data for each concentration $C_i$ consist of the number of successes (B-morph individuals) $s_i$ out of a total number of individuals $t_i$. The problem states that this is a Binomial sampling process. The probability of observing $s_i$ successes in $t_i$ trials, given a success probability $p_i = P(C_i; K, n)$, is given by the Binomial Probability Mass Function:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_i(K, n | C_i, s_i, t_i) = \\binom{t_i}{s_i} p_i^{s_i} (1 - p_i)^{t_i - s_i} $$\nAssuming that the outcomes at different concentrations are independent, the total likelihood for an entire dataset is the product of the individual likelihoods:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(K, n) = \\prod_{i} \\mathcal{L}_i = \\prod_{i} \\binom{t_i}{s_i} p_i^{s_i} (1 - p_i)^{t_i - s_i} $$\nFor analytical and computational convenience, we work with the log-likelihood function, $\\ln(\\mathcal{L})$. Maximizing $\\mathcal{L}$ is equivalent to maximizing $\\ln(\\mathcal{L})$.\n$$ \\ln \\mathcal{L}(K, n) = \\sum_{i} \\left[ \\ln\\binom{t_i}{s_i} + s_i \\ln(p_i) + (t_i - s_i) \\ln(1 - p_i) \\right] $$\nThe binomial coefficient term, $\\ln\\binom{t_i}{s_i}$, does not depend on the parameters $K$ and $n$. Therefore, it can be disregarded during optimization. The objective function to be maximized, the kernel of the log-likelihood, is:\n$$ \\ell(K, n) = \\sum_{i} \\left[ s_i \\ln(p_i) + (t_i - s_i) \\ln(1 - p_i) \\right] $$\nwhere $p_i = P(C_i; K, n)$.\n\n**3. Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Optimization**\n\nThe maximum likelihood estimates $(\\hat{K}, \\hat{n})$ are the values of $(K, n)$ that maximize $\\ell(K, n)$, subject to the constraints $K > 0$ and $n > 0$. This is a non-linear optimization problem. Standard numerical optimization algorithms seek to minimize a function. We therefore reformulate the problem as minimizing the negative log-likelihood:\n$$ (\\hat{K}, \\hat{n}) = \\arg\\min_{K>0, n>0} \\left( -\\ell(K, n) \\right) $$\nTo enforce the positivity constraints on $K$ and $n$, we employ a reparameterization. We define new, unconstrained parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ such that:\n$$ K = e^{\\alpha} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n = e^{\\beta} $$\nThe optimization is then performed over $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The objective function becomes:\n$$ f(\\alpha, \\beta) = - \\sum_{i} \\left[ s_i \\ln(p_i) + (t_i - s_i) \\ln(1 - p_i) \\right] $$\nwith $p_i$ now a function of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\nFor numerical stability, as suggested, the probability $p_i$ must be strictly bounded away from $0$ and $1$ to prevent $\\ln(0)$ or $\\ln(1-1)$ evaluations. We will clamp the computed probabilities within a small interval $[\\epsilon, 1-\\epsilon]$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive number (e.g., $10^{-9}$).\n\nTo mitigate the risk of converging to a local minimum, the optimization routine will be initiated from multiple starting points. A reasonable strategy is to use an informed guess for $K$ (such as the geometric mean of the concentrations) and test several plausible starting values for the steepness parameter $n$ (e.g., $1, 2, 5, 10$). The parameter set that yields the lowest minimum of the negative log-likelihood across all runs is chosen as the final estimate.\n\n**4. Biological Interpretation of Parameters**\n\n- **Parameter $K$ (Half-Maximal Concentration)**: This parameter, often denoted EC$_{50}$ in pharmacology, represents the hormone concentration that induces a response probability of $0.5$. In this context, it is the concentration required to cause half the population to switch to the B-morph. It serves as a fundamental measure of the developmental system's sensitivity to the hormonal signal. A lower value of $K$ signifies higher sensitivity.\n\n- **Parameter $n$ (Hill Coefficient)**: This dimensionless parameter quantifies the steepness of the response curve. It is an index of cooperativity.\n    - $n = 1$ implies a non-cooperative, gradual response, analogous to Michaelis-Menten kinetics.\n    - $n > 1$ implies positive cooperativity, where initial binding events increase the system's affinity for subsequent events. This results in a sharp, switch-like transition from the low-probability state to the high-probability state over a narrow range of hormone concentrations. A larger $n$ indicates a more ultrasensitive, switch-like behavior.\n    - $0 < n < 1$ would imply negative cooperativity, which is less common in developmental switches and results in a response that is more shallow than the non-cooperative case.\n\nThe estimation of these parameters from experimental data allows for a quantitative characterization of the developmental switch, providing insight into the underlying regulatory network's properties.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fits a Hill-type dose-response model to binomial data for four datasets\n    using maximum likelihood estimation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"C\": np.array([0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50]),\n            \"s\": np.array([0, 1, 6, 50, 89, 98, 100]),\n            \"t\": np.array([100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100]),\n        },\n        {\n            \"C\": np.array([1, 3, 10, 30, 100]),\n            \"s\": np.array([18, 46, 100, 150, 182]),\n            \"t\": np.array([200, 200, 200, 200, 200]),\n        },\n        {\n            \"C\": np.array([4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48]),\n            \"s\": np.array([0, 12, 75, 127, 148, 150]),\n            \"t\": np.array([150, 150, 150, 150, 150, 150]),\n        },\n        {\n            \"C\": np.array([0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8]),\n            \"s\": np.array([0, 1, 4, 10, 16, 19]),\n            \"t\": np.array([20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20]),\n        },\n    ]\n\n    def neg_log_likelihood(params, C, s, t):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the negative log-likelihood for the Hill model.\n        Parameters are log-transformed for unconstrained optimization.\n        `params` is a list or array [log_K, log_n].\n        \"\"\"\n        log_K, log_n = params\n        K = np.exp(log_K)\n        n = np.exp(log_n)\n\n        # Avoid division by zero if K is extremely small\n        if K < 1e-12:\n            return np.inf\n            \n        # Calculate predicted probabilities using the Hill equation\n        # p = C^n / (K^n + C^n)\n        # Numerically stable form: (C/K)^n / (1 + (C/K)^n)\n        # Handle C=0 case to avoid 0**n issues if n is negative (not here, but good practice)\n        C_safe = np.where(C == 0, 1e-12, C)\n        ratio_powered = (C_safe / K)**n\n        p = ratio_powered / (1.0 + ratio_powered)\n        \n        # Clamp probabilities to avoid log(0) or log(1)\n        epsilon = 1e-9\n        p = np.clip(p, epsilon, 1.0 - epsilon)\n\n        # Calculate binomial log-likelihood (ignoring constant combinatorial term)\n        logL = np.sum(s * np.log(p) + (t - s) * np.log(1.0 - p))\n\n        # Return the negative log-likelihood for minimization\n        return -logL\n\n    all_results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        C, s, t = case[\"C\"], case[\"s\"], case[\"t\"]\n\n        best_result = None\n        min_neg_log_lik = np.inf\n\n        # Strategy to mitigate local optima: use multiple starting points for n\n        # Use geometric mean of concentrations as a starting point for K\n        # Exclude C=0 from geometric mean calculation\n        valid_C = C[C > 0]\n        if len(valid_C) > 0:\n            k_guess = np.exp(np.mean(np.log(valid_C)))\n        else:\n            k_guess = 1.0 # Fallback if all concentrations are 0\n\n        n_guesses = [1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0]\n\n        for n_guess in n_guesses:\n            initial_params = [np.log(k_guess), np.log(n_guess)]\n            \n            opt_result = minimize(\n                neg_log_likelihood,\n                initial_params,\n                args=(C, s, t),\n                method='BFGS'\n            )\n\n            if opt_result.success and opt_result.fun < min_neg_log_lik:\n                min_neg_log_lik = opt_result.fun\n                best_result = opt_result.x\n\n        if best_result is None:\n            # This case should ideally not happen with the given data\n            # If all optimizations fail, append NaN or raise an error\n            K_opt, n_opt = np.nan, np.nan\n        else:\n            log_K_opt, log_n_opt = best_result\n            K_opt = np.exp(log_K_opt)\n            n_opt = np.exp(log_n_opt)\n        \n        all_results.extend([K_opt, n_opt])\n    \n    # Format the final output according to specification\n    formatted_results = [f\"{val:.3f}\" for val in all_results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2630130"}, {"introduction": "For plasticity to evolve, there must be genetic variation for the plastic response itself, a concept captured by genotype-by-environment ($G \\times E$) interactions.

Definition of reaction norm and `$V_{G \\times E}$` as variation in slopes among genotypes.\n    3. The suitability of linear mixed-effects models for analyzing such data.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scrutinized for validity.\n1.  **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly based in established principles of quantitative genetics and developmental biology. Facultative polyphenisms, reaction norms, genotype-by-environment interactions, and the decomposition of phenotypic variance are central concepts in evolutionary biology. The proposed experimental framework (paternal half-sib, split-brood) is a standard and powerful methodology for addressing such questions. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The objectives are clearly stated and quantifiable: estimate a population-level effect, separate specific variance components (`$V_G$`, `$V_M$`, `$V_{G \\times E}$`), and control for a confounding factor (`$V_{CE}$`). The question asks for the evaluation of specific experimental designs and statistical models against these clear objectives. A unique, best option can be determined. The problem is well-posed.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The language is technical, precise, and free from subjective or ambiguous terminology. All terms used (`paternal half-sib`, `reaction norm`, `linear mixed-effects model`) have rigorous definitions in the field. The problem is objective.\n4.  **Other Flaws:** The problem statement is self-contained, consistent, and describes a feasible (though complex) biological experiment. It is not trivial, metaphorical, or otherwise flawed according to the validation criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A full solution will be derived by evaluating each presented option against the stated scientific objectives.\n\n### Analysis of Options\n\nThe objective is to find an experimental design and statistical model that can simultaneously:\n1.  Estimate the mean plasticity (the slope of the population-level reaction norm).\n2.  Separate additive genetic variance (`$V_A$`, a component of `$V_G$`) from maternal effect variance (`$V_M$`).\n3.  Estimate the additive genetic variance in plasticity (`$V_{A \\times E}$`, a component of `$V_{G \\times E}$`).\n4.  Control for common-environment effects due to shared tanks (`$V_{CE}$).\n\n#### Option A\nThis option proposes a paternal half-sib split-brood design and a corresponding linear mixed-effects model.\n- **Design:** The paternal half-sib design, where each sire (`$s_i$`) is mated to multiple dams (`$d_{j(i)}$`), is the classical approach to disentangling additive genetic effects from maternal and other non-additive genetic effects. Variance among the offspring means of different sires allows for an estimate of `$\\frac{1}{4}V_A$`. Variance among the means of dams nested within sires allows for an estimate of `$\\frac{1}{4}V_A + \\frac{1}{4}V_D + V_{M}$` (where `$V_D$` is dominance genetic variance). This structure is essential for achieving **Goal 2**.\n- The split-brood aspect, where each family is exposed to both environments, is required to study plasticity and its genetic basis.\n- The use of replicate tanks (`$R \\ge 2$`) per family-environment combination is a critical feature. This replication allows for the separation of tank-level common environment variance (`$V_{CE}$`) from the family-by-environment interaction variance (`$V_{G \\times E}$`) and residual variance (`$V_\\varepsilon`). This achieves **Goal 4**.\n- The measurement of egg mass and its inclusion as a covariate provides a direct statistical control for a major source of pre-natal maternal effects, further improving the estimation.\n- **Model:** The proposed model is comprehensive and correctly specified.\n    - `$\\alpha_E\\,E_l$`: The fixed effect of environment estimates the average difference between the two environments, which is the slope of the population-level reaction norm. This achieves **Goal 1**.\n    - `$s_i$`: The random sire effect estimates the additive genetic variance in the phenotype's intercept.\n    - `$d_{j(i)}$`: The random dam-within-sire effect estimates maternal and remaining genetic variance in the intercept. Together with `$s_i$`, this achieves **Goal 2**.\n    - `$(sE)_{il}$`: The random sire-by-environment interaction effect. Its variance, `$\\sigma^2_{sE}$`, directly estimates the additive genetic variance for the slope of the reaction norm (`$\\frac{1}{4}V_{A \\times E}$`). This is the explicit measure of genetic variation in plasticity, achieving **Goal 3**.\n    - `$t_{k(l)}$`: The random tank effect. Its variance, `$\\sigma^2_t$`, directly estimates `$V_{CE}$`, achieving **Goal 4**.\nThis option provides a scientifically rigorous design and a correctly specified model that addresses all requirements of the problem.\n\n**Verdict on A: Correct**\n\n#### Option B\nThis option proposes a full-sib split-brood design.\n- **Design:** A full-sib design (`$S$` sires mated to `$S$` dams, `$D=1$`) means that all genetic and parental effects are confounded within a single \"family\" effect (`$f_k$`). It is impossible to separate the sire's contribution (additive genetics) from the dam's contribution (additive genetics plus maternal effects). Therefore, **Goal 2** cannot be met.\n- **Model:** The model `$$Y_{ijkl} \\;=\\; \\mu \\;+\\; \\alpha_E\\,E_l \\;+\\; f_k \\;+\\; (fE)_{kl} \\;+\\; \\varepsilon_{ijkl}$$` reflects this confounding. The variance of `$f_k$` lumps together `$V_G$`, `$V_M$`, and family-specific common environment effects. The variance of the interaction term `$(fE)_{kl}$` confounds `$V_{G \\times E}$` and `$V_{M \\times E}$`.\n- Most importantly, the model completely omits a term for the tank effect. Since the experimental design specifies that there are replicate tanks (`$R \\ge 2$`), failing to model the tank effect constitutes a serious misspecification. Any true tank effect will be aliased into other variance components, biasing the estimates. This fails **Goal 4**.\n\n**Verdict on B: Incorrect**\n\n#### Option C\nThis option modifies the design from A by using only one tank per family-environment combination (`$R=1$`).\n- **Design:** The use of a single tank (`$R=1$`) is a fatal design flaw known as pseudoreplication. With this design, the effect of the tank is perfectly confounded with the family-by-environment interaction. It is impossible to determine if a family's unique phenotype in a given environment is due to its genetics (`$G \\times E$`) or the specific, unique conditions of the single tank it was reared in (`$V_{CE}$`). This design makes it impossible to achieve **Goal 4**.\n- **Model:** The model `$$Y_{ijl} \\;=\\; \\mu \\;+\\; E_l \\;+\\; s_i \\;+\\; d_{j(i)} \\;+\\; (sdE)_{ij l} \\;+\\; \\varepsilon_{ijl}$$` omits a tank effect term because it cannot be estimated. The variance of the `$(sdE)_{ij l}` term would absorb both the true genetic interaction with the environment and the common-environment variance of the tank (`$\\sigma^2_{sdE} = \\sigma^2_{G \\times E} + \\sigma^2_{M \\times E} + \\sigma^2_{CE}$`), leading to an inflated and uninterpretable estimate of variance in plasticity. This fails to meet the core requirement of separating `$V_{G \\times E}` from `$V_{CE}$`.\n\n**Verdict on C: Incorrect**\n\n#### Option D\nThis option proposes a design with a vaguely described \"cross-fostering\" component and, most critically, an improperly specified model.\n- **Design:** While cross-fostering is a valid technique, the description here is unclear. The more significant issue lies with the model.\n- **Model:** The model `$$Y_{ijklm} \\;=\\; \\mu \\;+\\; \\alpha_E\\,E_l \\;+\\; \\alpha_F\\,F_m \\;+\\; (EF)_{lm} \\;+\\; t_k \\;+\\; \\varepsilon_{ijklm}$$` specifies family (`$F_m$`) and the family-by-environment interaction (`$(EF)_{lm}$`) as **fixed effects**. The objective of a quantitative genetics study is to make inferences about a population, not just the specific families in the experiment. To do this, one must estimate variance components (`$V_G$`, `$V_{G \\times E}$`, etc.), which requires treating family (or sire and dam) as a **random effect**. Treating family as a fixed effect allows one to test whether *these specific families* differ, but it does not permit the estimation of the variance in the population from which the families were sampled. Therefore, this model makes it impossible to quantify `$V_G$` or `$V_{G \\times E}$`, failing **Goals 2 and 3** fundamentally.\n- Furthermore, by lumping sire and dam into a single family term `$F_m$`, the model loses the ability to separate additive genetic from maternal effects, even if it were specified as a random effect.\n\n**Verdict on D: Incorrect**\n\n### Conclusion\nOnly Option A presents a complete and correct experimental and statistical framework. The paternal half-sib design allows for the separation of additive genetic from maternal effects. Replicating tanks within each family-environment combination is essential for separating common-environment effects from genotype-by-environment interactions. The proposed mixed-effects model correctly reflects this hierarchical design and includes all necessary random effects to estimate the target variance components (`$\\sigma^2_s$`, `$\\sigma^2_{sE}$`, `$\\sigma^2_t$`), thereby fulfilling all scientific objectives stated in the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2629992"}, {"introduction": "Measuring reaction norms seems straightforward, but a subtle and common pitfall can lead to entirely wrong conclusions: confounding the effects of the environment with the effects of developmental rate. An environment, like temperature, can alter both a trait and how fast an organism develops. This exercise [@problem_id:2629995] uses differential calculus to formally demonstrate how sampling at a fixed chronological time can conflate these two effects. Recognizing and correcting for this confounding, for instance by aligning samples by developmental stage rather than by age, is a hallmark of rigorous research in developmental plasticity.", "problem": "A research group aims to quantify a genotype-specific reaction norm of a craniofacial metric across a thermal gradient during early amphibian development. Let the focal phenotype be $y$, the external environment be $E$ (temperature), chronological time since fertilization be $t$, and a one-dimensional developmental progress variable (stage) be $s$. Assume a fixed genotype, negligible maternal effects, and that $s$ is strictly increasing in $t$ for all $E$ such that $s = g(t,E)$ with $g$ differentiable and $\\partial g/\\partial t \\gt 0$. The phenotype is generated by a differentiable stage-conditional response surface $f$ such that $y = f(s,E) + \\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon$ is a mean zero error independent of $E$ given $s$. The team, however, collected measurements at a fixed chronological time $t^\\star$ across environments and regressed $y$ on $E$ to estimate an apparent reaction norm slope at $t^\\star$.\n\nStarting only from the definitions above and standard results from differential calculus, explain whether estimating the reaction norm at fixed chronological time confounds the environmental effect on $y$ with environment-induced variation in developmental rate. Then evaluate methodological remedies in terms of their ability to recover the causal, stage-specific environmental effect, that is, the partial derivative $\\left.\\partial f/\\partial E\\right|_{s}$.\n\nWhich statements are correct?\n\nA. At fixed chronological time $t^\\star$, the observed derivative $\\left.\\mathrm{d}\\,\\mathbb{E}[y\\mid t^\\star,E]/\\mathrm{d}E\\right|_{t^\\star}$ decomposes into a direct component $\\left.\\partial f/\\partial E\\right|_{s}$ plus an indirect component $\\left.(\\partial f/\\partial s)\\right|_{E}\\cdot \\left.\\left(\\partial s/\\partial E\\right)\\right|_{t}$ via the chain rule, evaluated at $s=g(t^\\star,E)$. Therefore, measuring at a fixed $t^\\star$ generally confounds the environmental effect on developmental rate with the causal, stage-specific effect on $y$. Aligning observations by stage (e.g., sampling all individuals at the same morphological landmark) and estimating $\\left.\\partial f/\\partial E\\right|_{s}$ removes this confounding.\n\nB.

Standardizing samples by a developmental landmark (e.g., limb bud emergence) so that $s$ is equalized across $E$ and then fitting a model for $y$ that conditions on $s$—for example, using nonparametric regression of $y$ on $E$ at fixed $s$, or aligning entire trajectories via Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to a common stage axis and then estimating $\\partial f/\\partial E$—recovers the causal stage-specific environmental effect.\n\nD. Averaging $y$ over a broad chronological time window around $t^\\star$ yields an unbiased estimate of the stage-specific reaction norm, because faster and slower developers are balanced within the window.\n\nE. Without re-sampling by stage, a valid correction at $t^\\star$ is to estimate $\\left.\\partial s/\\partial E\\right|_{t^\\star}$ from the environment-dependence of landmark timing and to estimate $\\left.\\partial f/\\partial s\\right|_{E}$ from the local stage-trajectory of $y$.

It is a well-formulated, self-contained problem that addresses a fundamental issue in the study of developmental plasticity, namely the confounding of direct environmental effects with environment-induced changes in developmental rate. The definitions are precise, and the question is answerable through rigorous application of differential calculus. We will now proceed with the formal derivation and evaluation.\n\nThe system is defined by the following equations:\n$$ y = f(s, E) + \\varepsilon $$\n$$ s = g(t, E) $$\nwhere $y$ is the phenotype, $E$ is the environment, $t$ is chronological time, and $s$ is developmental stage. The error term $\\varepsilon$ has a conditional mean of zero, $\\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon \\mid s, E] = 0$.\n\nThe expected phenotype at a given time $t$ and environment $E$ is found by substituting the expression for $s$ into the model for $y$ and taking the expectation:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[y \\mid t, E] = \\mathbb{E}[f(g(t, E), E) + \\varepsilon \\mid t, E] $$\nGiven that $s$ is fully determined by $t$ and $E$, we have:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[y \\mid t, E] = f(g(t, E), E) + \\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon \\mid s=g(t,E), E] = f(g(t, E), E) $$\n\nThe experiment described involves measurements taken at a fixed chronological time $t = t^\\star$. The \"apparent reaction norm slope\" is the total derivative of the expected phenotype with respect to the environment $E$, holding time constant at $t^\\star$. This quantity is denoted $\\left.\\mathrm{d}\\,\\mathbb{E}[y\\mid t^\\star,E]/\\mathrm{d}E\\right|_{t^\\star}$. To compute this derivative, we apply the chain rule for multivariate functions to the composite function $\\phi(E) = f(g(t^\\star, E), E)$:\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\,\\mathbb{E}[y\\mid t^\\star,E]}{\\mathrm{d}E}\\right|_{t^\\star} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}E} f(g(t^\\star, E), E) $$\nLet the first argument of $f$ be denoted $s$ and the second be denoted $E$. The first argument $s$ is a function of $E$ (since $t$ is fixed at $t^\\star$), while the second argument is $E$ itself. The chain rule yields:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}E} f(s(E), E) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial s} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}s}{\\mathrm{d}E} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}E} $$\nSubstituting $s(E) = g(t^\\star, E)$, we find $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}s}{\\mathrm{d}E} = \\left.\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial E}\\right|_{t=t^\\star}$. Using the problem's notation $\\left.\\left(\\partial s/\\partial E\\right)\\right|_{t}$ for this partial derivative, we obtain the central decomposition:\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\,\\mathbb{E}[y\\mid t^\\star,E]}{\\mathrm{d}E}\\right|_{t^\\star} = \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E}\\right|_{s} + \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial s}\\right|_{E} \\cdot \\left.\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial E}\\right|_{t} $$\nAll derivatives on the right-hand side are evaluated at the point corresponding to $(t^\\star, E)$, i.e., at stage $s = g(t^\\star, E)$ and environment $E$.\n\nThis equation shows that the observed slope (left-hand side) is the sum of two terms:\n$1$. $\\left.\\partial f/\\partial E\\right|_{s}$: The causal, stage-specific environmental effect on the phenotype, which is the quantity of interest. This represents the \"direct\" effect of $E$ on $y$ at a constant developmental stage.\n$2$. $\\left.(\\partial f/\\partial s)\\right|_{E} \\cdot \\left.\\left(\\partial s/\\partial E\\right)\\right|_{t}$: An \"indirect\" effect that arises because the environment $E$ alters the developmental stage $s$ reached by chronological time $t^\\star$. This term is the product of the change in phenotype with stage ($\\partial f/\\partial s$) and the change in stage with environment at fixed time ($\\partial s/\\partial E$).\n\nTherefore, performing an experiment at a fixed chronological time $t^\\star$ confounds the direct effect of interest with an indirect effect mediated by developmental rate. The observed slope is a biased estimator for the causal effect $\\left.\\partial f/\\partial E\\right|_{s}$, unless $\\partial f/\\partial s = 0$ (phenotype is constant across stages) or $\\partial s/\\partial E = 0$ (environment does not affect developmental rate). We now evaluate each option.\n\nA. At fixed chronological time $t^\\star$, the observed derivative $\\left.\\mathrm{d}\\,\\mathbb{E}[y\\mid t^\\star,E]/\\mathrm{d}E\\right|_{t^\\star}$ decomposes into a direct component $\\left.\\partial f/\\partial E\\right|_{s}$ plus an indirect component $\\left.(\\partial f/\\partial s)\\right|_{E}\\cdot \\left.\\left(\\partial s/\\partial E\\right)\\right|_{t}$ via the chain rule, evaluated at $s=g(t^\\star,E)$. Therefore, measuring at a fixed $t^\\star$ generally confounds the environmental effect on developmental rate with the causal, stage-specific effect on $y$. Aligning observations by stage (e.g., sampling all individuals at the same morphological landmark) and estimating $\\left.\\partial f/\\partial E\\right|_{s}$ removes this confounding.\nThis statement is a precise and correct summary of our derivation. The decomposition formula is accurate. The conclusion that this constitutes confounding is correct. The proposed remedy—aligning observations by stage $s$—is the most direct way to isolate the parameter of interest. If $s$ is held constant at some value $s^\\star$, then any observed variation in $y$ with respect to $E$ must be due to the direct effect, as the indirect path through stage variation is blocked by experimental design. This directly estimates $\\left.\\partial f/\\partial E\\right|_{s=s^\\star}$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Including chronological time $t$ as a covariate in a linear model for $y$ eliminates bias due to environment-dependent developmental rate, because adjusting for $t$ blocks the spurious path from $E$ to $y$ through $s$.\nThis statement is incorrect for multiple reasons. First, the specified experiment is conducted at a *fixed* chronological time $t^\\star$. In such a dataset, $t$ is a constant and cannot be included as a covariate in any model; it has zero variance. Second, even if data were available across a range of $t$ and $E$, simply \"adjusting for $t$\" in a linear model $y \\sim E + t$ is a gross misspecification of the true functional relationship $y \\approx f(g(t, E), E)$. Third, from a causal perspective, the confounding arises because at a fixed $t$, $s$ is a function of $E$. Conditioning on $t$ does not block the path $E \\to s \\to y$; rather, it is the very condition under which this confounding path operates. The correct variable to condition on to block this path is the mediator $s$, not its cause $t$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Standardizing samples by a developmental landmark (e.g., limb bud emergence) so that $s$ is equalized across $E$ and then fitting a model for $y$ that conditions on $s$—for example, using nonparametric regression of $y$ on $E$ at fixed $s$, or aligning entire trajectories via Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to a common stage axis and then estimating $\\partial f/\\partial E$—recovers the causal stage-specific environmental effect.\nThis statement proposes methodologically sound approaches to solve the problem. Standardizing by a developmental landmark is a practical implementation of \"aligning observations by stage,\" as discussed in option A. This ensures that comparisons are made at a fixed $s$, thus isolating $\\partial f/\\partial E$. Dynamic Time Warping is a more sophisticated technique for aligning entire developmental trajectories $y(t)$ onto a common axis that represents developmental stage, rather than chronological time. Once this alignment is achieved, one can analyze the relationship between $y$ and $E$ at any point along the shared stage axis, thereby estimating $\\left.\\partial f/\\partial E\\right|_{s}$ for any chosen $s$. Both proposed methods are valid strategies for disentangling the direct and indirect effects.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. Averaging $y$ over a broad chronological time window around $t^\\star$ yields an unbiased estimate of the stage-specific reaction norm, because faster and slower developers are balanced within the window.\nThis assertion is baseless. As derived earlier, the quantity measured at any given time $t$ is a confounded mixture of the direct and indirect effects. Averaging this confounded quantity over a time window $[t^\\star - \\Delta t, t^\\star + \\Delta t]$ will produce an average of confounded estimates. There is no mathematical or biological principle that guarantees the confounding term $\\left((\\partial f/\\partial s) \\cdot (\\partial s/\\partial E)\\right)$ will integrate to zero over this window. The notion of \"balancing\" is unfounded wishful thinking. For instance, if higher temperatures consistently accelerate development ($\\partial s/\\partial E > 0$) and the phenotype consistently increases with stage ($\\partial f/\\partial s > 0$), the confounding term is strictly positive, and its integral will also be positive. This method does not remove bias.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. Without re-sampling by stage, a valid correction at $t^\\star$ is to estimate $\\left.\\partial s/\\partial E\\right|_{t^\\star}$ from the environment-dependence of landmark timing and to estimate $\\left.\\partial f/\\partial s\\right|_{E}$ from the local stage-trajectory of $y$. The corrected stage-specific effect satisfies $\\left.\\partial f/\\partial E\\right|_{s} = \\left.\\mathrm{d}\\,\\mathbb{E}[y\\mid t^\\star,E]/\\mathrm{d}E\\right|_{t^\\star} - \\left.(\\partial f/\\partial s)\\right|_{E}\\cdot \\left.\\left(\\partial s/\\partial E\\right)\\right|_{t^\\star}$ evaluated at the reference stage, under smoothness and local-identifiability conditions.\nThis statement proposes a statistical correction instead of an experimental one. The equation provided is a simple algebraic rearrangement of our fundamental decomposition:\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E}\\right|_{s} = \\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\,\\mathbb{E}[y\\mid t^\\star,E]}{\\mathrm{d}E}\\right|_{t^\\star} - \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial s}\\right|_{E} \\cdot \\left.\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial E}\\right|_{t} $$\nThis equation is mathematically correct. The option then correctly posits that the terms in the subtraction can be estimated from additional data. The observed slope $\\mathrm{d}\\,\\mathbb{E}[y\\mid t^\\star,E]/\\mathrm{d}E$ comes from the original flawed experiment. The term $\\partial s/\\partial E$ can be estimated from data on how the timing to reach landmarks varies with environment. The term $\\partial f/\\partial s$ can be estimated from data on how the phenotype varies with stage within a given environment. Provided these components can be estimated with sufficient precision, one can compute an unbiased estimate of the causal effect $\\partial f/\\partial E$ by subtracting the estimated confounding effect from the observed total effect. This is a valid, though potentially data-intensive, analytical strategy.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2629995"}]}
