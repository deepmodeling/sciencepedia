Ethanol exposure pertinent to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) elevates acetaldehyde, which can bind to the ALDH active site and competitively inhibit retinaldehyde oxidation. In contrast, thalidomide perturbs development through Cereblon (CRBN) E3 ubiquitin ligase–mediated substrate dysregulation and anti-angiogenic actions, not by directly altering RA enzymology. Focusing on the ethanol/acetaldehyde mechanism, consider a localized embryonic microdomain in which the retinaldehyde concentration remains effectively constant during the time window of interest.\n\nAssume the ALDH-catalyzed reaction obeys steady-state Michaelis–Menten kinetics and that acetaldehyde acts as a purely competitive inhibitor with inhibition constant $K_{i}$.

In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor binds to the enzyme's active site, competing with the substrate. This type of inhibition increases the apparent Michaelis constant, $K_{m}^{\\text{app}}$, but does not affect $V_{\\max}$. The equation for the rate of the inhibited reaction, $v_i$, is:\n$$\nv_i = \\frac{V_{\\max} [\\text{RetA}]}{K_{m}^{\\text{app}} + [\\text{RetA}]}\n$$\nwhere the apparent Michaelis constant is defined as:\n$$\nK_{m}^{\\text{app}} = K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[\\text{Acet}]}{K_i}\\right)\n$$\nHere, $[\\text{Acet}]$ is the inhibitor concentration and $K_i$ is the inhibition constant.

The proposed mechanism for thalidomide action—binding to Cereblon (CRBN) to induce degradation of the transcription factor SALL4—is consistent with current leading hypotheses in developmental toxicology. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem defines a system of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a complete set of initial conditions and parameters for each test case. This constitutes a well-posed initial value problem for which a unique solution exists. The task is to find this solution via numerical integration and apply a clearly defined criterion.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative mathematical and biological terms. All variables, parameters, and criteria are unambiguously defined.\n- **Verification of Consistency**: The condition that baseline SALL4 level $S(t)=1$ is a steady state in the absence of drug is checked. For $C(t)=0$, we have $B(t)=0$. The SALL4 equation becomes $\\frac{dS}{dt} = k_{\\text{syn}} - k_{\\text{deg0}}\\,S$. At steady state, $\\frac{dS}{dt}=0$, which implies $S = k_{\\text{syn}} / k_{\\text{deg0}}$. The provided constants are $k_{\\text{syn}}=0.1\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$ and $k_{\\text{deg0}}=0.1\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$, which correctly yields a steady state of $S=1$. The problem is internally consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed problem in computational systems biology. We proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires the numerical simulation of a system of four coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that model the teratogenic effect of thalidomide on limb bud growth. The state of the system at any time $t$ is described by the vector $\\mathbf{y}(t) = [C(t), B(t), S(t), G(t)]^T$. The dynamics are governed by the following system, $\\frac{d\\mathbf{y}}{dt} = f(t, \\mathbf{y})$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = -k_{e}\\,C - k_{\\text{on}}\\,C\\,(R_{\\text{tot}}-B) + k_{\\text{off}}\\,B\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dB}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}\\,C\\,(R_{\\text{tot}}-B) - k_{\\text{off}}\\,B\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = k_{\\text{syn}} - k_{\\text{deg0}}\\,S - k_{\\text{ub}}\\,B\\,S\n$$\n$$\n\\fracdG}{dt} = r_{0}\\,\\frac{S^{n}}{S^{n}+K^{n}}\n$$\nThis system is nonlinear and cannot be solved analytically. Therefore, a numerical approach is necessary. We will use a standard numerical ODE solver to integrate the system over the time interval $[0, T_{\\text{end}}]$ where $T_{\\text{end}} = 72.0\\,\\text{h}$. The `solve_ivp` function from the SciPy library is suitable for this task.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine for each test case if phocomelia onset occurs, which is defined by the condition $\\rho < \\theta$, where $\\rho$ is the ratio of drug-exposed cumulative growth to control cumulative growth, and $\\theta = 0.7$ is a fixed threshold.\n\nFirst, we must determine the control growth, $G_{\\text{ctrl}}(T_{\\text{end}})$. This corresponds to the trajectory with no drug exposure, i.e., $C_0 = 0$. As established during validation, if $C(0)=0$ and $B(0)=0$, then $C(t)=0$ and $B(t)=0$ for all $t$. Consequently, SALL4 level remains at its homeostatic steady state, $S(t) = 1$. The growth rate is therefore constant:\n$$\n\\frac{dG_{\\text{ctrl}}}{dt} = r_{0}\\,\\frac{1^n}{1^n+K^n} = 1.0 \\times \\frac{1}{1 + 0.5^2} = \\frac{1}{1.25} = 0.8 \\text{ growth units/h}\n$$\nIntegrating from $t=0$ to $t=T_{\\text{end}}=72.0\\,\\text{h}$ gives the total control growth:\n$$\nG_{\\text{ctrl}}(T_{\\text{end}}) = 0.8\\,\\text{h}^{-1} \\times 72.0\\,\\text{h} = 57.6 \\text{ growth units}\n$$\nWe will use this value as the reference for all test cases. Test Case 2 is this exact control scenario and serves as a consistency check for the numerical implementation.\n\nFor each of the four test cases, the following procedure is implemented:\n1.  Define the parameters $(C_0, k_e, k_{\\text{on}}, k_{\\text{off}}, R_{\\text{tot}}, k_{\\text{ub}})$ for the specific case, along with the global constants.\n2.  Set the initial condition vector $\\mathbf{y}(0) = [C_0, 0, 1, 0]^T$.\n3.  Numerically integrate the ODE system from $t=0$ to $t=T_{\\text{end}}$.\n4.  Extract the final cumulative growth, $G_{\\text{drug}}(T_{\\text{end}})$, which is the fourth component of the state vector at the final time point.\n5.  Calculate the growth ratio $\\rho = G_{\\text{drug}}(T_{\\text{end}}) / 57.6$.\n6.  Evaluate the boolean condition $\\rho < 0.7$.\n\nThe results for all four cases are collected and formatted into the required output string.
