A well-tested observation is that this segmental restriction yields one DRG condensation per somite in the trunk, provided that the anteroposterior polarity of the somite is intact and that condensations are counted where the trunk neural crest cells contribute, excluding cranial, vagal, and sacral domains.\n\nConsider a model trunk domain defined along the anteroposterior axis with total length $L = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.

First, a critical validation of the problem statement is necessary.\n\n**Problem Validation:**\n1.  **Givens Extraction**:\n    - Total length of the trunk domain: $L = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    - Somite center-to-center distance, representing the length of a single segmental period: $s = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    - Biological premise: One DRG condensation forms per somite in the trunk. Let $N_{DRG}$ be the number of DRGs and $N_{somites}$ be the number of somites. The premise is $N_{DRG} = N_{somites}$.\n    - Boundary Condition: The domain starts and ends at somite boundaries, meaning the total length $L$ is an integer multiple of the somite period length $s$. There are no partial somites.\n    - Exclusions: Contributions from cranial, vagal, and sacral neural crest cells are outside the domain. Secondary modifications like fusion or apoptosis are to be ignored.\n\n2.  **Validation Verdict**: The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of developmental biology, specifically the segmental organization of the peripheral nervous system. The one-to-one correspondence between trunk somites and DRGs is a well-established observation. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data ($L$ and $s$) and a critical boundary condition that eliminates ambiguity. The values are biologically plausible. The problem is not trivial in a pedagogical sense, as it demands the translation of a biological description into a mathematical model, a fundamental skill in quantitative science. The problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n**Solution Derivation:**\nThe core of the problem lies in the quantitative application of the biological principle of segmentation. The number of DRG condensations, denoted as $N_{DRG}$, is stated to be equal to the number of somites, $N_{somites}$, within the defined trunk domain.\n$$ N_{DRG} = N_{somites} $$\nThus, the task reduces to calculating the number of somites within the trunk domain.\n\nThe trunk domain is defined by its total length, $L = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The somites are described as periodic structures, with a repeating interval (center-to-center distance) of $s = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. This parameter $s$ represents the length of one complete segmental unit.\n\nThe instruction to find the \"number of full periods accommodated within $L$\" translates to calculating how many times the segmental length $s$ fits into the total length $L$. This is a simple division:\n$$ N_{somites} = \\frac{L}{s} $$\nThe problem provides a crucial simplifying assumption: \"The rostral and caudal boundaries of the trunk domain coincide with somite boundaries, so there are no partial somites at the edges.\" This condition ensures that the total length $L$ is an exact integer multiple of the segmental length $s$. Consequently, the ratio $\\frac{L}{s}$ will yield an integer result, and there is no need to consider floor or ceiling functions to handle incomplete segments at the boundaries.\n\nSubstituting the provided values into the equation:\n$$ L = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\n$$ s = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nThe number of somites is calculated as:\n$$ N_{somites} = \\frac{10}{0.4} $$\nTo perform the division without a calculator, we can express the denominator as a fraction:\n$$ N_{somites} = \\frac{10}{\\frac{4}{10}} = \\frac{10 \\times 10}{4} = \\frac{100}{4} $$\n$$ N_{somites} = 25 $$\nThe result is a dimensionless integer, as expected for a count. The units of millimeters in the numerator and denominator cancel.\n\nAccording to the foundational biological premise of the problem, the number of DRG condensations is equal to the number of somites.\n$$ N_{DRG} = N_{somites} = 25 $$\nTherefore, the expected number of DRG condensations within the specified trunk domain is $25$.
