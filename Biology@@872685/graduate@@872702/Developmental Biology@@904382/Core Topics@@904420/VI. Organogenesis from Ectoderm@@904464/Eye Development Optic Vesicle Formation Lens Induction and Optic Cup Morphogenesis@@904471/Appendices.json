It is a standard, albeit non-trivial, exercise in mathematical biology. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is partitioned into two tasks as requested.\n\n**Task 1: Formulation of the Ordinary Differential Equation**\n\nThe rate of change of the concentration of the effective transcription factor $x$, denoted $\\frac{dx}{dt}$, is the difference between its production rate and its degradation rate.\n\nThe production of $x$ is cooperative and subject to both self-activation and repression by $Shh$. The maximal production rate is $\\alpha$.\n- The self-activation term, following the assumption of Hill-type kinetics, is given by the function $\\frac{x^n}{K^n + x^n}$. This is a sigmoidal function that ranges from $0$ to $1$.\n- The repression by $Shh$ (concentration $H$) is a multiplicative factor, also described by a Hill-type function. For repression, the standard form is $\\frac{J^m}{J^m + H^m}$, which ranges from $1$ (no repression, $H=0$) to $0$ (strong repression, $H \\to \\infty$).\n\nThe total production rate is the product of the maximal rate and these two modulatory factors:\n$$ \\text{Production Rate} = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{x^n}{K^n + x^n} \\right) \\left( \\frac{J^m}{J^m + H^m} \\right) $$\n\nThe degradation of $x$ is a first-order process, meaning the rate of degradation is directly proportional to its concentration $x$.

At a bifurcation point, a stable steady state (the high-$x$ eye-field state) and an unstable steady state merge and annihilate each other. This occurs when the curve of the production rate is exactly tangent to the line of the degradation rate.\n\nLet $f(x, H) = \\frac{dx}{dt}$. The steady states are the solutions to $f(x, H) = 0$. The saddle-node bifurcation at the critical point $(x_c, H_c)$ is defined by two simultaneous conditions:\n1. The system is at a steady state: $f(x_c, H_c) = 0$.\n2. The steady state is marginally stable (the tangency condition): $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{(x_c, H_c)} = 0$.\n\nFrom condition $1$:\n$$ \\alpha \\left( \\frac{x_c^n}{K^n + x_c^n} \\right) \\left( \\frac{J^m}{J^m + H_c^m} \\right) = \\delta x_c $$\nAssuming the non-trivial case $x_c  0$, we can divide by $x_c$:\n$$ \\alpha \\left( \\frac{x_c^{n-1}}{K^n + x_c^n} \\right) \\left( \\frac{J^m}{J^m + H_c^m} \\right) = \\delta \\quad (*)$$\n\nNow, we apply condition $2$.

By equating the left-hand sides of $(*)$ and $(**)$:\n$$ \\alpha \\left( \\frac{x_c^{n-1}}{K^n + x_c^n} \\right) \\left( \\frac{J^m}{J^m + H_c^m} \\right) = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{J^m}{J^m + H_c^m} \\right) \\left( \\frac{n K^n x_c^{n-1}}{(K^n + x_c^n)^2} \\right) $$\nWe can cancel the common factors $\\alpha$, $\\frac{J^m}{J^m + H_c^m}$, and $x_c^{n-1}$ (since $x_c  0$):\n$$ \\frac{1}{K^n + x_c^n} = \\frac{n K^n}{(K^n + x_c^n)^2} $$\nMultiplying both sides by $(K^n + x_c^n)^2$ yields:\n$$ K^n + x_c^n = n K^n $$\n$$ x_c^n = n K^n - K^n = K^n(n-1) $$\nThis gives the critical concentration of the transcription factor $x_c$:\n$$ x_c = K(n-1)^{\\frac{1}{n}} $$\nNote that a real, positive solution for $x_c$ requires $n-1  0$, or $n1$. This is a necessary condition for bistability and the existence of a saddle-node bifurcation at a non-zero concentration.\n\nFinally, we substitute this result for $x_c$ back into equation $(*)$ to solve for $H_c$.\nFrom $x_c^n = K^n(n-1)$, we have $K^n + x_c^n = K^n + K^n(n-1) = n K^n$.\nAlso, $x_c^{n-1} = \\left(K(n-1)^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\right)^{n-1} = K^{n-1}(n-1)^{\\frac{n-1}{n}}$.\nSubstituting these into equation $(*)$:\n$$ \\alpha \\left( \\frac{K^{n-1}(n-1)^{\\frac{n-1}{n}}}{n K^n} \\right) \\left( \\frac{J^m}{J^m + H_c^m} \\right) = \\delta $$\n$$ \\alpha \\left( \\frac{(n-1)^{\\frac{n-1}{n}}}{n K} \\right) \\left( \\frac{J^m}{J^m + H_c^m} \\right) = \\delta $$\nNow, we isolate the term containing $H_c$:\n$$ \\frac{J^m}{J^m + H_c^m} = \\frac{n \\delta K}{\\alpha (n-1)^{\\frac{n-1}{n}}} $$\nInverting both sides gives:\n$$ \\frac{J^m + H_c^m}{J^m} = \\frac{\\alpha (n-1)^{\\frac{n-1}{n}}}{n \\delta K} $$\n$$ 1 + \\left(\\frac{H_c}{J}\\right)^m = \\frac{\\alpha (n-1)^{\\frac{n-1}{n}}}{n \\delta K} $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{H_c}{J}\\right)^m = \\frac{\\alpha (n-1)^{\\frac{n-1}{n}}}{n \\delta K} - 1 $$\nSolving for $H_c$ yields the final expression for the critical Shh concentration:\n$$ H_c = J \\left( \\frac{\\alpha (n-1)^{\\frac{n-1}{n}}}{n \\delta K} - 1 \\right)^{\\frac{1}{m}} $$\nThis expression represents the threshold concentration of Shh above which the high-expression state of the eye-field gene network is no longer a stable steady state, leading to its repression and the splitting of the eye field.
