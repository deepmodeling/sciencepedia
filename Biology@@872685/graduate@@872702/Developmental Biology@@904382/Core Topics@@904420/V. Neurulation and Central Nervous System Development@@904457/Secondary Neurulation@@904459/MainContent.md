## Introduction
The formation of the [central nervous system](@entry_id:148715) is a cornerstone of vertebrate [embryogenesis](@entry_id:154867), initiated by a process known as [neurulation](@entry_id:187036). While the folding of the neural plate to form the brain and most of the spinal cord—termed [primary neurulation](@entry_id:183324)—is widely studied, the posterior-most portion of the axis arises through a different and equally critical mechanism: secondary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036). This process, involving the [condensation](@entry_id:148670) of a mesenchymal cell mass and its subsequent transformation into a hollow tube, is essential for completing the body plan and has profound implications for human health, regeneration, and evolution. This article addresses the knowledge gap between these two modes of development, providing a detailed examination of the unique principles governing the formation of the caudal spinal cord.

Across the following chapters, you will gain a graduate-level understanding of this complex process. The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, delineates the core cellular and molecular events, starting with a foundational comparison to [primary neurulation](@entry_id:183324). It explores the unique neuromesodermal progenitor niche in the tail bud and details the intricate morphogenetic cascade from mesenchymal aggregation to the cavitation of a new [lumen](@entry_id:173725). The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, broadens the perspective to explore the profound clinical relevance of secondary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036) in the context of closed spinal dysraphisms, its integration with adjacent developmental systems like [somitogenesis](@entry_id:185604), and its role as a blueprint for [spinal cord regeneration](@entry_id:263146) and a driver of evolutionary diversity. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** chapter provides a series of conceptual exercises designed to challenge your understanding of [experimental design](@entry_id:142447), [lineage tracing](@entry_id:190303), and the bioinformatic analysis of developmental trajectories. We begin by dissecting the fundamental principles that transform a seemingly disorganized cell mass into a precisely patterned neural structure.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The formation of the neural tube, a foundational event in vertebrate [embryogenesis](@entry_id:154867), is not a monolithic process. While the anterior central nervous system, including the brain and the majority of the spinal cord, is formed by a well-characterized process of epithelial folding known as [primary neurulation](@entry_id:183324), the posterior-most regions of the spinal cord arise through a mechanistically distinct process: **secondary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036)**. This chapter delineates the core principles and mechanisms governing secondary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036), from the unique properties of its progenitor cells to the intricate orchestration of [tissue morphogenesis](@entry_id:270100) and patterning.

### Foundational Distinctions: Primary versus Secondary Neurulation

Understanding secondary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036) begins with a clear contrast against its primary counterpart. Primary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036) is fundamentally a process of **epithelial sheet folding**. It initiates with the neural plate, a thickened pseudostratified columnar epithelium. Through a series of coordinated [cell shape](@entry_id:263285) changes, particularly **[apical constriction](@entry_id:272311)** at defined **hinge points**, the flat neural plate bends, elevates its lateral edges (the **neural folds**), and fuses them along the dorsal midline to create a hollow tube. Histologically, this process is characterized by an open neural groove that progressively closes, always in direct continuity with the overlying surface ectoderm until the final separation of the neural tube [@problem_id:2669761].

In stark contrast, secondary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036) is a process of **[mesenchymal condensation](@entry_id:188664) and [cavitation](@entry_id:139719)** [@problem_id:2669714]. It does not begin with a pre-formed epithelial sheet. Instead, its precursor is a seemingly unorganized aggregate of mesenchymal cells located in the posterior-most region of the embryo, known as the tail bud. The process unfolds through a stereotyped sequence of events:
1.  **Condensation**: Mesenchymal cells aggregate to form a dense, solid rod known as the **[medullary cord](@entry_id:181221)**.
2.  **Mesenchymal-to-Epithelial Transition (MET)**: The cells within the [medullary cord](@entry_id:181221) transform from migratory, non-polarized mesenchymal cells into a stationary, polarized epithelium.
3.  **Cavitation**: A lumen, or central canal, forms *de novo* within the solid epithelial cord. This occurs not by folding, but by the formation of multiple, small, non-contiguous microlumens that subsequently coalesce into a single, continuous channel.

This fundamental mechanistic difference—folding of an epithelium versus [cavitation](@entry_id:139719) within a mesenchymal condensate—defines the two modes of [neurulation](@entry_id:187036). The transition between them occurs at a specific point along the [anterior-posterior axis](@entry_id:202406). In the [chick embryo](@entry_id:262176), this switch happens at the lumbosacral level, caudal to approximately somite 27, beginning around Hamburger-Hamilton (HH) stage 17–18. In the mouse, the transition is similarly located at the lumbar/sacral boundary, beginning after the posterior neuropore closes around embryonic day (E) 9.5–10.0 at the level of somite ~31 [@problem_id:2669714]. This dual origin of the spinal cord has profound implications for the interpretation of regional patterning, a concept we will return to later in this chapter.

### The Progenitor Niche and Its Regulation

The unique mechanism of secondary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036) is rooted in the unique properties of its progenitor cells, which reside in a specialized environment at the caudal end of the elongating embryo.

#### The Tail Bud, Caudal Cell Mass, and Chordoneural Hinge

The posterior growth zone is a complex and dynamic region for which several key terms must be carefully distinguished. The **tail bud** is the general anatomical term for the entire mass of mesenchymal cells at the posterior tip that fuels axial elongation. Within this structure, more specific progenitor populations can be identified. In avian embryos, a large and prominent aggregate known as the **caudal cell mass (CCM)** is the primary source of the secondary neural tube. It is this mass that directly undergoes condensation and cavitation. In mammals like the mouse, where the tail is less extensive, a discrete CCM is not typically observed. Instead, the secondary neural tube is generated predominantly from progenitors within the **chordoneural hinge (CNH)** and the immediately adjacent mesenchyme. The CNH is a conserved group of cells at the posterior-most tip of the [notochord](@entry_id:260635) and neural tube floor plate, acting as an [organizing center](@entry_id:271860). Thus, while the CNH in the chick primarily contributes to the floor plate and notochord, its role in the mouse is expanded to generate the entire secondary neural tube [@problem_id:2669775].

#### Neuromesodermal Progenitors: A Bistable System

At the heart of the tail bud niche lies a remarkable population of bipotent progenitors known as **[neuromesodermal progenitors](@entry_id:195077) (NMPs)**. These cells are the common precursors for both the secondary neural tube (neurectoderm) and the posterior [paraxial mesoderm](@entry_id:203589) (somites).

Functionally, NMPs are defined by their capacity for self-renewal and their bipotency. Transcriptionally, they are characterized by the simultaneous co-expression of the neural progenitor factor **Sox2** and the nascent [mesoderm](@entry_id:141679) factor **T (Brachyury)**, alongside posterior identity genes of the Cdx family [@problem_id:2669780].

This co-expression does not represent a stable, hybrid fate. Instead, it reflects a "poised" or metastable state governed by a **bistable gene regulatory network**. The Sox2-driven neural program and the T/Bra-driven mesodermal program are mutually antagonistic. Sox2 activity leads to the repression of key mesodermal factors, while T/Bra activity leads to the repression of Sox2. This cross-repression creates a toggle switch with two stable outcomes, or "[attractor states](@entry_id:265971)": a high-Sox2/low-T state for neural commitment and a low-Sox2/high-T state for mesodermal commitment. The NMP exists at the unstable equilibrium point of this switch, poised to fall into either valley [@problem_id:2669780].

The decision is directed by opposing [morphogen gradients](@entry_id:154137) that pattern the posterior embryo. The extreme posterior tail bud is characterized by high levels of **Wnt** and **Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF)** signaling, which sustains the NMP state and biases fate choice towards [mesoderm](@entry_id:141679). In contrast, **Retinoic Acid (RA)**, synthesized in the already-formed anterior [somites](@entry_id:187163), forms an opposing gradient with high levels anteriorly. RA signaling promotes neural differentiation and represses the mesodermal program. Critically, these pathways are mutually inhibitory: high FGF/Wnt signaling actively suppresses RA signaling in the tail bud (for instance, by inducing the RA-degrading enzyme Cyp26B1), thereby protecting the progenitor pool. As cells are left behind by the elongating tail bud, they experience decreasing Wnt/FGF and increasing RA, which flips the [bistable switch](@entry_id:190716) towards the neural fate. This system creates a moving "determination front" where progenitor potency is maintained caudally while differentiation proceeds in a timely and spatially organized manner rostrally [@problem_id:2669758].

### The Morphogenetic Cascade: From Mesenchyme to Epithelial Tube

The commitment of NMP descendants to a neural fate initiates an intricate sequence of cellular and molecular events that transforms a loose mesenchymal aggregate into a hollow epithelial tube.

#### Step 1: Condensation of the Medullary Cord

The first morphogenetic step is the aggregation of the dispersed mesenchymal cells of the caudal cell mass into the compact, solid [medullary cord](@entry_id:181221). This [condensation](@entry_id:148670) is driven by a significant increase in cell-cell adhesion. This process is critically dependent on the upregulation of cell [surface adhesion](@entry_id:201783) molecules, most notably **N-[cadherin](@entry_id:156306)** and the **Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (NCAM)**. Homophilic binding between these molecules on adjacent cells provides the cohesive force necessary to form the dense cord structure, marking the first step of the [mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition](@entry_id:265165) [@problem_id:1713120].

#### Step 2: Mesenchymal-to-Epithelial Transition and Polarity Establishment

Once condensed, the [medullary cord](@entry_id:181221) must transform into a true epithelium. This MET involves the establishment of **apico-basal polarity**. A basement membrane is deposited around the periphery of the cord, which cells engage via integrin receptors, defining their basal (outward-facing) surface. Concurrently, conserved polarity complexes are recruited to establish the apical (inward-facing) domain. The **Par complex** (Par3/Par6/aPKC) and the **Crumbs complex** are localized to what will become the central, [lumen](@entry_id:173725)-facing surfaces of the cells. This establishment of polarity is coupled with the formation of a robust junctional belt at the newly formed apicolateral boundary. **N-cadherin**-based [adherens junctions](@entry_id:148890) provide mechanical linkage, while **[tight junctions](@entry_id:143539)**, containing [scaffolding proteins](@entry_id:169854) like ZO-1 and barrier proteins like [claudins](@entry_id:163087), assemble to create a seal, a prerequisite for [lumen](@entry_id:173725) formation [@problem_id:2669715] [@problem_id:2669761].

#### Step 3: Lumenogenesis by Cord Hollowing and Cavitation

With an epithelialized, polarized, but still solid cord in place, the central canal must be formed. This occurs via a process of "cord hollowing."

First, cells organize themselves around future luminal centers. This is often achieved through the formation of **multicellular rosettes**, where a group of cells orients their newly defined apical domains toward a common central point. This coordinated behavior is driven by **[apical constriction](@entry_id:272311)**, an [actomyosin](@entry_id:173856)-based contraction regulated by the Rho-ROCK signaling pathway [@problem_id:2669715].

At the apical foci within these rosettes, multiple small, discontinuous **microlumens** nucleate [@problem_id:2669761]. This involves the targeted delivery of apical membrane vesicles, a process dependent on Rab-family GTPases. The establishment of a coherent, single [lumen](@entry_id:173725) from these scattered starting points requires exquisite temporal and spatial control. A crucial principle is that a stable, unified apical domain must be established *before* significant lumen expansion or other apical specializations, like [ciliogenesis](@entry_id:260662), can occur. If [ciliogenesis](@entry_id:260662) were to initiate before the apical domain is fully defined (i.e., if $T_{cil}  T_p$, where $T_{cil}$ is the time of cilium assembly and $T_p$ is the time of polarity establishment), the limited pool of trafficking machinery (e.g., Rab11- and Rab8-dependent carriers) would be prematurely diverted. This would compromise apical junction maturation and lead to the persistence of multiple, non-coalescing lumens. Therefore, the necessary sequence $T_p \le T_d \le T_{cil}$ (where $T_d$ is [basal body](@entry_id:169309) docking) ensures that polarity provides a stable template for subsequent morphogenesis [@problem_id:2669700].

The final step is the **coalescence** of these microlumens. This is an active process that requires several inputs. First, the rosettes and their associated microlumens must be aligned along the midline of the tissue, a process coordinated by **Planar Cell Polarity (PCP)** signaling. Second, the nascent apical surfaces must be made anti-adhesive to allow lumens to merge rather than having their opposing surfaces re-adhere. This is accomplished by trafficking anti-adhesive [glycoproteins](@entry_id:171189), such as **podocalyxin**, to the apical membrane, which helps to clear [cadherins](@entry_id:144307) from the lumenal surface. Finally, the lumens expand and fuse, driven by ion transport (e.g., via the Na+/K+ ATPase) that creates an osmotic gradient, drawing water through [aquaporins](@entry_id:138616) to inflate the space. This coordinated molecular ballet ensures that multiple small cavities reliably merge into a single, continuous central canal [@problem_id:2669744].

### Patterning the Secondary Neural Tube

Despite its dramatically different morphogenetic origin, the secondary neural tube must be patterned along its primary axes to integrate seamlessly with the rest of the [central nervous system](@entry_id:148715). This is achieved by deploying conserved signaling logic in a new context.

#### Dorsal-Ventral Patterning

The dorsal-ventral (DV) axis of the neural tube is specified by opposing gradients of morphogens: **Sonic hedgehog (Shh)** from the ventral midline (notochord and floor plate) and **Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs)** from the dorsal midline (surface ectoderm and roof plate). A key question is how this patterning is established when the secondary neural tube forms internally, without direct contact with the surface [ectoderm](@entry_id:140339). Experimental evidence from explant cultures provides a clear answer. If a [medullary cord](@entry_id:181221) is isolated without its normal surrounding tissues (the notochord and surface [ectoderm](@entry_id:140339)), it fails to pattern correctly. However, if a bead soaked in Shh protein is placed ventrally and a bead soaked in BMP protein is placed dorsally, a near-perfect DV pattern of progenitor domains (e.g., dorsal Pax7, intermediate Pax6, ventral Olig2/Nkx2.2) is reconstituted. This demonstrates that the fundamental logic is conserved: the cells of the secondary neural tube are competent to interpret the same extrinsic Shh and BMP gradients, even though their [morphogenesis](@entry_id:154405) is distinct [@problem_id:2669769].

#### Anterior-Posterior Regionalization

The dual origin of the spinal cord has profound consequences for its anterior-posterior (AP) regionalization, particularly across the lumbosacral region. As discussed, the transition from primary to secondary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036) marks a transition between two distinct signaling environments: a rostral, high-RA environment and a caudal, high-FGF/Wnt environment. Regional identity along the AP axis is encoded by the combinatorial expression of **HOX genes**. The expression of these genes is tightly regulated by the prevailing signaling environment. Therefore, the lumbosacral axis, which spans this morphogenetic and signaling boundary, cannot be considered a uniform territory. The shift in signals from the primary to the secondary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036) zone results in a corresponding shift in the regulation and expression domains of the posterior HOX genes (e.g., HOX10-13 paralogs). This complex patterning underpins the specialized anatomy and connectivity of the lumbosacral spinal cord, which controls hindlimb and pelvic functions, and must be interpreted in light of the region's unique dual developmental history [@problem_id:2669719].
