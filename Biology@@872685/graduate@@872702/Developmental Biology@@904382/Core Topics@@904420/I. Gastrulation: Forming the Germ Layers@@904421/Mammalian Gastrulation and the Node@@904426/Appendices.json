A solution will be provided.\n\nThe starting point is the incompressible momentum balance for a Newtonian fluid, also known as the Navier-Stokes equation for an incompressible fluid:\n$$\n\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v} \\right) = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{f}\n$$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity vector field, $t$ is time, $p$ is the pressure, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $\\mathbf{f}$ represents body forces.\n\nThe problem states the flow is steady, which means all time derivatives are zero: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$. It also states to neglect body forces, so $\\mathbf{f} = \\mathbf{0}$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v} = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}\n$$\nThe term on the left, $\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v}$, represents inertial effects (momentum advection), while the term $\\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}$ represents viscous effects (momentum diffusion).\n\nTo perform a scaling analysis, we introduce dimensionless variables, denoted with an asterisk ($*$). We define characteristic scales for the physical quantities: $U$ for speed and $L$ for length. The variables can be written as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v} = U \\mathbf{v}^*\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla = \\frac{1}{L} \\nabla^*\n$$\nSubstituting these into the simplified momentum equation:\n$$\n\\rho \\left( (U \\mathbf{v}^*) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{L} \\nabla^*\\right) \\right) (U \\mathbf{v}^*) = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\left(\\frac{1}{L^2} \\nabla^{*2}\\right) (U \\mathbf{v}^*)\n$$\nWe consolidate the constant coefficients for each term:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\rho U^2}{L} \\right) (\\mathbf{v}^* \\cdot \\nabla^*) \\mathbf{v}^* = -\\nabla p + \\left( \\frac{\\mu U}{L^2} \\right) \\nabla^{*2} \\mathbf{v}^*\n$$\nThe magnitudes of the dimensionless quantities ($\\mathbf{v}^*$, $\\nabla^*$, etc.) are of order one, $O(1)$. Therefore, the scale of the inertial term is $\\frac{\\rho U^2}{L}$, and the scale of the viscous term is $\\frac{\\mu U}{L^2}$.\n\nThe dimensionless ratio that compares inertial to viscous effects is the ratio of these characteristic scales:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Scale of inertial effects}}{\\text{Scale of viscous effects}} = \\frac{\\rho U^2 / L}{\\mu U / L^2} = \\frac{\\rho U^2 L^2}{\\mu U L} = \\frac{\\rho U L}{\\mu}\n$$\nThis dimensionless group is the Reynolds number, denoted $Re$.\n$$\nRe = \\frac{\\rho U L}{\\mu}\n$$\n\nThe mathematical criterion that defines the low-inertia (creeping) regime is when inertial effects are negligible compared to viscous effects. This occurs when the Reynolds number is much less than one:\n$$\nRe \\ll 1\n$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate this ratio for the given representative parameters.

The maximum likelihood estimate for the probability $p(E=0)$ is the observed frequency:\n$$\n\\hat{p}_0 = \\frac{N_1}{N_1+N_0} = \\frac{2}{8} = 0.25\n$$\nFor the group with $E_i=1$, the outcomes are $y = [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]$. There are $N_1=6$ EMT events and $N_0=2$ non-events. The maximum likelihood estimate for $p(E=1)$ is:\n$$\n\\hat{p}_1 = \\frac{N_1}{N_1+N_0} = \\frac{6}{8} = 0.75\n$$\n\nWe now solve for $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ using these probabilities:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\beta_0) = \\hat{p}_0 = 0.25\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1) = \\hat{p}_1 = 0.75\n$$\nInverting the sigmoid function, $\\sigma^{-1}(p) = \\text{logit}(p) = \\log\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)$:\n$$\n\\beta_0 = \\text{logit}(0.25) = \\log\\left(\\frac{0.25}{1-0.25}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\frac{0.25}{0.75}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = -\\log(3) \\approx -1.0986\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 = \\text{logit}(0.75) = \\log\\left(\\frac{0.75}{1-0.75}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\frac{0.75}{0.25}\\right) = \\log(3) \\approx 1.0986\n$$\nSolving for $\\beta_1$:\n$$\n\\beta_1 = (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1) - \\beta_0 = \\log(3) - (-\\log(3)) = 2\\log(3) \\approx 2.1972\n$$\nThe estimated model parameters are $\\hat{\\beta}_0 = -\\log(3)$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1 = 2\\log(3)$. The predictive model is $p(E) = \\sigma(-\\log(3) + 2\\log(3) \\cdot E)$.\n\n**3. Prediction on Evaluation Datasets**\n\nWe use the estimated parameters and the training-derived $S_{\\min}=0.2, S_{\\max}=1.2$ to compute the average predicted probabilities for each evaluation dataset.\n\n-   **Dataset A (mixed)**: $5$ cells with signal $0.2$, $5$ cells with signal $1.2$.\n    -   For signal $0.2$: $E = 0$. $p(0) = \\sigma(\\hat{\\beta}_0) = 0.25$.\n    -   For signal $1.2$: $E = 1$. $p(1) = \\sigma(\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1) = 0.75$.\n    -   Mean fraction: $\\frac{1}{10}(5 \\times 0.25 + 5 \\times 0.75) = 0.5 \\times (0.25 + 0.75) = 0.5 \\times 1.0 = 0.5$.\n\n-   **Dataset B (low boundary)**: $10$ cells with signal $0.2$.\n    -   All cells have $E = 0$. The probability for each is $p(0) = 0.25$.\n    -   Mean fraction: $0.25$.\n\n-   **Dataset C (high boundary)**: $10$ cells with signal $1.2$.\n    -   All cells have $E = 1$. The probability for each is $p(1) = 0.75$.\n    -   Mean fraction: $0.75$.\n\n-   **Dataset D (intermediate)**: $10$ cells with signal $0.7$.\n    -   For signal $0.7$: $E = \\frac{0.7 - 0.2}{1.2 - 0.2} = \\frac{0.5}{1.0} = 0.5$.\n    -   The probability is $p(0.5) = \\sigma(\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\times 0.5) = \\sigma(-\\log(3) + 2\\log(3) \\times 0.5) = \\sigma(-\\log(3) + \\log(3)) = \\sigma(0)$.\n    -   $\\sigma(0) = \\frac{1}{1+e^0} = \\frac{1}{1+1} = 0.5$.\n    -   Mean fraction: $0.5$.\n\nThe final results, rounded to four decimal places, are:\n-   Dataset A: $0.5000$\n-   Dataset B: $0.2500$\n-   Dataset C: $0.7500$\n-   Dataset D: $0.5000$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{[0.5000, 0.2500, 0.7500, 0.5000]}$$", "id": "2649551"}]}
