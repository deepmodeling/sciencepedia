Consider a Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-beta) morphogen, Nodal, which acts as an activator that promotes its own transcription and induces expression of its extracellular inhibitors, the Lefty proteins. Anterior Visceral Endoderm (AVE) produces the inhibitor Lefty1 at the anterior margin and, subsequently, the axial midline expresses Lefty1 as a barrier. The epiblast produces the inhibitor Lefty2 in a Nodal-dependent fashion near the emerging primitive streak. It is well established that inhibitors in activator–inhibitor systems often diffuse more rapidly than the activator, so assume $D_{L} > D_{N}$, where $D_{L}$ is the effective diffusivity of Lefty proteins and $D_{N}$ is the effective diffusivity of Nodal. Let $N(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ denote the concentration of Nodal and let $L_1(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ and $L_2(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ denote the concentrations of Lefty1 and Lefty2, respectively, with $\\mathbf{r}$ a spatial coordinate on the embryo surface. Assume the following qualitative ingredients hold, consistent with activator–inhibitor theory and with tissue-restricted gene expression in the mouse embryo: \n- Nodal production increases with $N$ (auto-activation) and is antagonized by $L_1 + L_2$.\n- $L_1$ has an exogenous source in the AVE at the anterior margin (establishing an anterior boundary condition on $N$) and later at the midline (establishing a left–right barrier), whereas $L_2$ is produced in the epiblast proportionally to local Nodal activity.\n- Fate allocation requires a confined Nodal field near the posterior epiblast to generate the primitive streak while protecting anterior neuroectoderm from excessive Nodal, and left–right patterning requires confinement of Nodal to one lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) side, relying on a midline barrier.\n\nUsing only these principles and the standard properties of activator–inhibitor systems, predict how the spatial Nodal field and downstream phenotypes will differ in the following loss-of-function genotypes: $Lefty1^{-/-}$, $Lefty2^{-/-}$, and $Lefty1^{-/-}; Lefty2^{-/-}$.

It is well-posed for a qualitative analysis.\n- **Objective**: The language is technical and unbiased.\n- **Complete**: For the task of qualitative prediction, the provided information is sufficient. It explicitly states to use only the given principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-formulated, scientifically accurate problem that requires logical deduction based on the principles of developmental biology and pattern formation. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe problem describes a classic activator-inhibitor system. Nodal ($N$) is the short-range activator with auto-activation, and Lefty proteins ($L_1, L_2$) are the long-range inhibitors ($D_{L} > D_{N}$). The distinct spatial sources of the two Lefty proteins imply they have different primary functions.\n\n1.  **Role of Lefty1 ($L_1$)**: $L_1$ is expressed from fixed sources at the anterior margin (AVE) and the midline.\n    - The anterior source establishes a global anterior-to-posterior gradient of inhibition, shielding the anterior epiblast from Nodal produced in the posterior. This is essential for protecting the presumptive neuroectoderm and allowing primitive streak formation only in the posterior.\n    - The midline source acts as a linear barrier, preventing Nodal from crossing from the left side to the right side of the embryo, which is necessary for establishing left-right asymmetry.\n    - Thus, $L_1$ is a global patterning inhibitor that sets up large-scale boundaries.\n\n2.  **Role of Lefty2 ($L_2$)**: $L_2$ is produced in response to Nodal activity itself, in the posterior region where Nodal is active. This constitutes a local negative feedback loop. The activator induces its own inhibitor. Since the inhibitor diffuses faster, it forms a field of inhibition that surrounds and contains the domain of activator expression. This feedback is critical for stabilizing the size of the Nodal domain and preventing its uncontrolled expansion due to auto-activation.\n    - Thus, $L_2$ is a local feedback inhibitor that refines and restricts the activator domain.\n\nWith these roles established, we can predict the phenotypes of the mutants.\n\n-   **$Lefty1^{-/-}$ Phenotype**: The loss of $L_1$ means the removal of the global boundaries.\n    - The anterior shield is gone, so Nodal signaling will spread ectopically into the anterior epiblast, compromising the development of anterior structures like the head and forebrain.\n    - The midline barrier is gone, so Nodal, which is normally restricted to the left lateral plate mesoderm (LPM), will now appear bilaterally in the LPM of both sides. This leads to a loss of left-right asymmetry, resulting in laterality defects (e.g., randomization of heart looping and organ situs).\n    - The local inhibitor $L_2$ is still present, so Nodal activity in the posterior will not be completely uncontrolled, but its spatial domain will be incorrectly patterned due to the missing boundaries.\n\n-   **$Lefty2^{-/-}$ Phenotype**: The loss of $L_2$ means the removal of the local negative feedback.\n    - The Nodal auto-activation loop in the posterior is now less constrained. This will cause the posterior domain of Nodal expression to expand in size and intensity.\n    - An expanded Nodal domain leads to an increase in the induction of Nodal-dependent tissues, primarily mesoderm and endoderm (mesendoderm), which form from the primitive streak. This results in a \"posteriorized\" phenotype, with an excess of posterior tissues.\n    - The global inhibitor $L_1$ is still present. The AVE-derived $L_1$ still protects the anterior, and the midline-derived $L_1$ still functions as a barrier. Therefore, left-right patterning should remain largely intact.\n\n-   **$Lefty1^{-/-}$; $Lefty2^{-/-}$ (Double Mutant) Phenotype**: All Nodal inhibitors are removed.\n    - The system now consists only of an auto-activating morphogen ($N$). Without any inhibition, Nodal signaling will expand catastrophically throughout the entire epiblast.\n    - There is no anterior protection, no midline barrier, and no local feedback. The result is ubiquitous, high-level Nodal activity.\n    - This complete loss of spatial patterning makes normal gastrulation impossible. All cell fates will be mis-specified. This leads to severe, global developmental failure and very early embryonic lethality.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n-   **A. $Lefty1^{-/-}$: Minimal change in Nodal distribution because epiblast-derived Lefty2 is sufficient; left–right patterning remains normal. $Lefty2^{-/-}$: Loss of the main Nodal barrier causes bilateral Nodal in the LPM and randomized laterality. Double mutant: Partial rescue due to redundancy in Nodal auto-activation.**\n    - This option is **Incorrect**. It misattributes the roles. $L_1$ is critical for L-R patterning, so its loss is not minimal and L-R patterning will not be normal. It incorrectly states $L_2$ provides the main Nodal barrier. A \"rescue\" in the double mutant is biologically nonsensical; removing all inhibition leads to catastrophic failure.\n\n-   **B. $Lefty1^{-/-}$: Anterior and midline Nodal barriers are lost, allowing ectopic anterior Nodal exposure and bilateral LPM Nodal with left–right randomization; anterior neural patterning is compromised. $Lefty2^{-/-}$: Posterior Nodal domain broadens with increased mesendoderm induction and posteriorization, but left–right patterning remains largely intact due to the midline Lefty1 barrier and AVE restriction. Double mutant: Severe global Nodal overexpansion with failure to protect anterior fates and loss of midline laterality barrier, causing catastrophic gastrulation defects and early lethality.**\n    - This option is **Correct**. Each description accurately matches the logical deductions derived from the problem's principles. It correctly separates the boundary-setting role of $L_1$ from the local feedback role of $L_2$ and correctly predicts the consequences of their individual and combined loss.\n\n-   **C. $Lefty1^{-/-}$: The Nodal field shrinks because Lefty1 is required for Nodal stabilization, leading to reduced mesendoderm. $Lefty2^{-/-}$: The Nodal field collapses at the posterior boundary, causing failure of primitive streak initiation. Double mutant: Phenocopies Nodal-null embryos with absent Nodal signaling.**\n    - This option is **Incorrect**. It fundamentally misunderstands the role of an inhibitor. Loss of an inhibitor ($Lefty$) would cause the activator ($Nodal$) field to expand, not shrink or collapse. The double mutant would have maximal Nodal signaling, the opposite of a Nodal-null phenotype.\n\n-   **D. $Lefty1^{-/-}$: Bilateral Nodal arises but expanded head structures form due to enhanced anterior neuroectoderm protection by Lefty2. $Lefty2^{-/-}$: Decreased mesendoderm due to loss of a Nodal cofactor; left–right patterning unaffected. Double mutant: Normal gastrulation due to compensatory Wnt signaling in the absence of Lefty proteins.**\n    - This option is **Incorrect**. It contains multiple errors. Loss of $L_1$ compromises, not enhances, anterior protection. Lefty proteins are inhibitors, not cofactors, so loss of $L_2$ increases, not decreases, mesendoderm. The claim of normal gastrulation in the double mutant due to external compensation is speculative, contrary to the instruction to use only the provided principles, and biologically false.\n\nThus, option B is the only one that correctly applies the principles of activator-inhibitor systems to the specific biological context provided.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2618663"}, {"introduction": "Moving from conceptual logic to quantitative prediction requires translating biological interactions into a mathematical framework.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe physical process is described by a reaction-diffusion equation. At steady state, the rate of change of concentration is zero. The balance in a small segment $dx$ is given by (net flux in) + (production) - (degradation) = $0$. In one dimension, this translates to the differential equation:\n$$D_W \\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} + s - k_W C = 0$$\nThis is the governing steady-state balance equation. It is a second-order, linear, inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation. We rearrange it into a standard form:\n$$\\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - \\frac{k_W}{D_W} C(x) = -\\frac{s}{D_W}$$\nLet us define the characteristic length scale $\\lambda^{-1}$ where $\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_W}{D_W}}$.

A \"no-flux\" boundary at $x=L$ means the concentration gradient is zero, as flux is proportional to the gradient (Fick's first law, $J = -D_W \\frac{dC}{dx}$). Thus,$\\frac{dC}{dx}\\Big|_{x=L} = 0$.\nThe boundary conditions are:\n$$C(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dC}{dx}\\Big|_{x=L} = 0$$\n\nb) **No sink**: \"No-flux\" at both ends implies that the gradient is zero at both boundaries.\nThe boundary conditions are:\n$$\\frac{dC}{dx}\\Big|_{x=0} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dC}{dx}\\Big|_{x=L} = 0$$\n\n**2) Analytical Solution and Comparison**\n\nThe general solution to the inhomogeneous ODE is the sum of the homogeneous solution ($C_h$) and a particular solution ($C_p$). The homogeneous equation is $\\frac{d^2C_h}{dx^2} - \\lambda^2 C_h = 0$, which has the general solution $C_h(x) = A \\cosh(\\lambda x) + B \\sinh(\\lambda x)$. For the particular solution, we observe that the right-hand side is a constant, so we seek a constant solution $C_p(x) = K$. Substituting into the ODE gives $0 - \\lambda^2 K = -\\lambda^2 \\frac{s}{k_W}$, which yields $C_p(x) = \\frac{s}{k_W}$. This is the uniform concentration that would exist if production were balanced by degradation everywhere with no net diffusion.\nThe full general solution is:\n$$C(x) = A \\cosh(\\lambda x) + B \\sinh(\\lambda x) + \\frac{s}{k_W}$$\n\n**Solution for case (a): AVE-localized sink**\nWe apply the boundary conditions $C(0) = 0$ and $\\frac{dC}{dx}\\Big|_{x=L} = 0$ to find the constants $A$ and $B$.\nFirst, $C(0) = 0$:\n$$A \\cosh(0) + B \\sinh(0) + \\frac{s}{k_W} = 0 \\implies A + 0 + \\frac{s}{k_W} = 0 \\implies A = -\\frac{s}{k_W}$$\nNext, we find the derivative, $\\frac{dC}{dx} = A\\lambda \\sinh(\\lambda x) + B\\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda x)$.\nApplying $\\frac{dC}{dx}\\Big|_{x=L} = 0$:\n$$A\\lambda \\sinh(\\lambda L) + B\\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda L) = 0 \\implies B \\cosh(\\lambda L) = -A \\sinh(\\lambda L)$$\n$$B = -A \\tanh(\\lambda L) = -\\left(-\\frac{s}{k_W}\\right) \\tanh(\\lambda L) = \\frac{s}{k_W} \\tanh(\\lambda L)$$\nSubstituting $A$ and $B$ back into the general solution:\n$$C_a(x) = -\\frac{s}{k_W}\\cosh(\\lambda x) + \\left(\\frac{s}{k_W} \\tanh(\\lambda L)\\right) \\sinh(\\lambda x) + \\frac{s}{k_W}$$\n$$C_a(x) = \\frac{s}{k_W} \\left( 1 - \\cosh(\\lambda x) + \\frac{\\sinh(\\lambda L)}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} \\sinh(\\lambda x) \\right)$$\n$$C_a(x) = \\frac{s}{k_W} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\cosh(\\lambda x)\\cosh(\\lambda L) - \\sinh(\\lambda x)\\sinh(\\lambda L)}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} \\right)$$\nUsing the hyperbolic identity $\\cosh(u-v) = \\cosh(u)\\cosh(v) - \\sinh(u)\\sinh(v)$, this simplifies to:\n$$C_a(x) = \\frac{s}{k_W} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\cosh(\\lambda(L-x))}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} \\right)$$\nThe emergent characteristic length scale that controls the spatial decay of the solution is the parameter $l = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_W}{k_W}}$. This length scale dictates how far the influence of the boundary conditions penetrates into the bulk of the tissue before the solution approaches the production-clearance balance of $\\frac{s}{k_W}$.\n\n**Solution for case (b): No sink**\nWe apply the boundary conditions $\\frac{dC}{dx}\\Big|_{x=0}=0$ and $\\frac{dC}{dx}\\Big|_{x=L}=0$.\nThe derivative is $\\frac{dC}{dx} = A\\lambda \\sinh(\\lambda x) + B\\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda x)$.\nAt $x=0$:\n$$A\\lambda \\sinh(0) + B\\lambda \\cosh(0) = 0 \\implies 0 + B\\lambda = 0 \\implies B = 0$$\nAt $x=L$, with $B=0$:\n$$A\\lambda \\sinh(\\lambda L) = 0$$\nSince $\\lambda > 0$ and we assume $L>0$, $\\sinh(\\lambda L) \\neq 0$. Therefore, we must have $A=0$.\nWith $A=0$ and $B=0$, the solution reduces to the particular solution:\n$$C_b(x) = \\frac{s}{k_W}$$\nThis is a uniform concentration profile.\n\n**Comparison**:\nIn the absence of a localized sink (case b), the system reaches a trivial uniform steady state where local production ($s$) is perfectly balanced by local degradation ($k_W C$), resulting in a flat concentration profile $C_b(x) = s/k_W$. There is no concentration gradient.\nIn contrast, the presence of the AVE-localized sink (case a) forces the concentration to zero at the anterior end, $C_a(0)=0$. This establishes a concentration gradient that drives a diffusive flux of Wnt3 towards the sink. The solution $C_a(x)$ shows a profile that rises from $0$ at the anterior boundary and approaches the bulk concentration $s/k_W$ over the characteristic length scale $l = 1/\\lambda$. The gradient is steepest at the anterior, $\\frac{dC_a}{dx}\\Big|_{x=0} = \\frac{s \\lambda}{k_W} \\tanh(\\lambda L)$, and flattens to zero at the posterior. The AVE sink thus \"sharpens\" the anterior profile by creating a robust concentration gradient where none would otherwise exist.

If $S(L) \\le \\Theta$, set $x^{\\star} = L$.\n\n- As a baseline without Dkk$1$ ($D_A=0$), the boundary $x_0$ satisfies $W(x_0)=\\Theta$, so $x_0 = \\lambda \\ln\\!\\left(\\dfrac{\\Theta}{W_0}\\right)$, clipped to the interval $[0,L]$ using the same edge-case conventions applied to $W(x)$.\n\n- Define the Dkk$1$-induced shift of the T/Bra expression boundary as $\\Delta x = x^{\\star} - x_0$, expressed in micrometers.\n\nYour task is to write a complete, runnable program that, for each test case below, computes the boundary with Dkk$1$ ($x^{\\star}$), the baseline boundary without Dkk$1$ ($x_0$), and outputs the shift $\\Delta x$ as a float. All positions must be expressed in micrometers, and concentrations in nanomolar. Use only the model given above; do not introduce additional assumptions.\n\nTest suite (each tuple lists $(L, W_0, \\lambda, \\Theta, K_D, D_A, \\mu)$ with $L,\\lambda,\\mu$ in $\\mu$m and $W_0,\\Theta,K_D,D_A$ in nM):\n- Case A (happy path, no antagonist): $(1000, 0.05, 200, 0.6, 10, 0, 150)$\n- Case B (moderate Dkk$1$): $(1000, 0.05, 200, 0.6, 10, 30, 150)$\n- Case C (strong Dkk$1$): $(1000, 0.05, 200, 0.6, 10, 100, 150)$\n- Case D (short Dkk$1$ length scale): $(1000, 0.05, 200, 0.6, 10, 30, 50)$\n- Case E (low threshold edge case): $(1000, 0.05, 200, 0.03, 10, 30, 150)$\n\nRequirements:\n- For each case, compute $x^{\\star}$ by solving $S(x)=\\Theta$ using the stated edge-case conventions if necessary, compute $x_0$ from the baseline, and return $\\Delta x = x^{\\star}-x_0$ in $\\mu$m as a float.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, ordered as $[ \\Delta x_{\\mathrm{A}}, \\Delta x_{\\mathrm{B}}, \\Delta x_{\\mathrm{C}}, \\Delta x_{\\mathrm{D}}, \\Delta x_{\\mathrm{E}} ]$.", "solution": "We begin from two fundamental bases. First, steady-state diffusion with first-order degradation and a localized posterior source yields an exponential morphogen profile. When the coordinate is measured from anterior ($x=0$) to posterior ($x=L$), the Wnt concentration is well represented by $W(x) = W_0 \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$, where $W_0>0$ is the Wnt level at the anterior and $\\lambda>0$ the characteristic length. Second, reversible binding between Dkk$1$ and the Lrp$5/6$ co-receptor at equilibrium follows the law of mass action: the fraction of free receptor $f_R$ in the presence of antagonist concentration $C$ with dissociation constant $K_D>0$ is $f_R = \\frac{1}{1 + C/K_D}$. With a decaying AVE-derived Dkk$1$ profile $D(x) = D_A \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\mu}\\right)$, where $D_A \\ge 0$ and $\\mu>0$, the free-co-receptor fraction becomes $f_R(x)=\\frac{1}{1 + D(x)/K_D}$.\n\nEffective Wnt signal transduction depends multiplicatively on ligand and available co-receptor, so we model $S(x)$ as\n$$\nS(x) \\;=\\; W(x)\\,f_R(x)\n\\;=\\;\n\\frac{W_0\\,\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)}{1 + \\dfrac{D_A}{K_D}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\dfrac{x}{\\mu}\\right)}.\n$$\nFor $W_0>0$, $\\lambda>0$, $K_D>0$, $D_A\\ge 0$, and $\\mu>0$, both $W(x)$ and $f_R(x)$ increase with $x$, hence $S(x)$ is monotonically increasing on $[0,L]$. Therefore, the equation $S(x)=\\Theta$ with $\\Theta>0$ has at most one solution in $(0,L)$ and is well-posed for locating the unique anterior boundary of T/Brachyury expression.\n\nBaseline boundary in the absence of Dkk$1$ ($D_A=0$). In this case, $S(x)=W(x)=W_0 \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$. The boundary $x_0$ satisfies\n$$\nW_0 \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{x_0}{\\lambda}\\right) \\;=\\; \\Theta\n\\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\;\nx_0 \\;=\\; \\lambda \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{\\Theta}{W_0}\\right).\n$$\nBecause the physical domain is $[0,L]$ and $W(x)$ is monotonically increasing, we impose edge-case clipping consistent with the biological interpretation:\n- If $W(0) = W_0 \\ge \\Theta$, then $x_0$ is set to $0$ (expression present throughout).\n- If $W(L) = W_0 \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda}\\right) \\le \\Theta$, then $x_0$ is set to $L$ (no expression).\n\nBoundary with Dkk$1$. With $D_A>0$,\n$$\nS(x) \\;=\\; \\frac{W_0\\,e^{x/\\lambda}}{1 + \\alpha\\,e^{-x/\\mu}}, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\alpha = \\frac{D_A}{K_D}.\n$$\nWe seek $x^{\\star}\\in[0,L]$ such that $S(x^{\\star})=\\Theta$. Define $F(x) = S(x)-\\Theta$. The monotonicity of $S(x)$ implies that $F(x)$ is strictly increasing. Hence, a unique solution exists in $(0,L)$ if and only if $F(0)<0$ and $F(L)>0$. For the edge cases, the unique minimizer/maximizer under monotonicity yields:\n- If $F(0)\\ge 0$ then set $x^{\\star}=0$.\n- If $F(L)\\le 0$ then set $x^{\\star}=L$.\n\nClosed-form solutions are not generally available because the equation\n$$\n\\frac{W_0 e^{x/\\lambda}}{1 + \\alpha e^{-x/\\mu}} \\;=\\; \\Theta\n$$\ncombines exponentials with incommensurate exponents $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$. Nevertheless, given monotonicity, $x^{\\star}$ can be found robustly by bisection (or any bracketing method) on $[0,L]$ when $F(0)<0<F(L)$, guaranteeing convergence.\n\nNonlinear sink interpretation. The Dkk$1$–Lrp$5/6$ interaction reduces the free co-receptor fraction nonlinearly as $f_R(x)=\\frac{1}{1 + D(x)/K_D}$. This creates a nonlinear, saturable reduction in signaling capacity that depends on the local antagonist level. Because $D(x)$ itself varies with position, the denominator $1+\\alpha e^{-x/\\mu}$ introduces a position-dependent, nonlinear attenuation of signaling, effectively acting as a sink for Wnt signaling rather than a simple linear decay. The impact on the T/Brachyury boundary is quantified by the shift\n$$\n\\Delta x \\;=\\; x^{\\star} - x_0,\n$$\ncomputed in micrometers.\n\nAlgorithm for each test case:\n1. Read $(L, W_0, \\lambda, \\Theta, K_D, D_A, \\mu)$.\n2. Compute baseline $x_0$ by $x_0=\\lambda\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{\\Theta}{W_0}\\right)$ and clip to $[0,L]$ using the monotonic edge rules for $W(x)$.\n3. Define $S(x)=\\dfrac{W_0 e^{x/\\lambda}}{1 + (D_A/K_D)e^{-x/\\mu}}$ and $F(x)=S(x)-\\Theta$.\n4. If $F(0)\\ge 0$ set $x^{\\star}=0$. Else if $F(L)\\le 0$ set $x^{\\star}=L$. Otherwise, find the unique root $x^{\\star}\\in(0,L)$ by bisection using the bracket $[0,L]$.\n5. Return $\\Delta x = x^{\\star}-x_0$.\n6. Aggregate the five results as a single list.\n\nThe final program implements this procedure and prints a single line containing $[\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{A}}, \\Delta x_{\\mathrm{B}}, \\Delta x_{\\mathrm{C}}, \\Delta x_{\\mathrm{D}}, \\Delta x_{\\mathrm{E}}]$ in micrometers.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef signaling_Wnt(x, W0, lam, KD, DA, mu):\n    \"\"\"\n    Effective Wnt signaling S(x) = W(x) * f_R(x)\n    with W(x) = W0 * exp(x/lam)\n         f_R(x) = 1 / (1 + D(x)/KD)\n         D(x) = DA * exp(-x/mu)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Avoid overflow for large exponents by relying on numpy's exp stability\n    numerator = W0 * np.exp(x / lam)\n    denom = 1.0 + (DA / KD) * np.exp(-x / mu)\n    return numerator / denom\n\ndef baseline_boundary(L, W0, lam, Theta):\n    \"\"\"\n    Baseline boundary x0 for DA = 0, i.e., W(x) = W0 * exp(x/lam).\n    Edge conventions:\n      - If W(0) >= Theta: x0 = 0\n      - If W(L) <= Theta: x0 = L\n      - Else: x0 = lam * ln(Theta/W0)\n    \"\"\"\n    W_anterior = W0\n    W_posterior = W0 * np.exp(L / lam)\n    if W_anterior >= Theta:\n        return 0.0\n    if W_posterior <= Theta:\n        return float(L)\n    # Interior solution\n    x0 = lam * np.log(Theta / W0)\n    # Numerical safety: clip to [0, L]\n    if x0 < 0.0:\n        x0 = 0.0\n    elif x0 > L:\n        x0 = float(L)\n    return float(x0)\n\ndef boundary_with_dkk(L, W0, lam, Theta, KD, DA, mu, tol=1e-12, max_iter=200):\n    \"\"\"\n    Boundary x* solving S(x) = Theta with S monotone increasing.\n    Edge conventions:\n      - If S(0) >= Theta: x* = 0\n      - If S(L) <= Theta: x* = L\n      - Else: unique root in (0, L) found by bisection.\n    \"\"\"\n    def F(x):\n        return signaling_Wnt(x, W0, lam, KD, DA, mu) - Theta\n\n    f0 = F(0.0)\n    fL = F(float(L))\n\n    if f0 >= 0.0:\n        return 0.0\n    if fL <= 0.0:\n        return float(L)\n\n    # Bisection in [a, b] with f(a) < 0 < f(b)\n    a, b = 0.0, float(L)\n    fa, fb = f0, fL\n\n    # Ensure proper bracketing\n    if not (fa < 0.0 and fb > 0.0):\n        # In pathological numerical edge cases, fall back to scanning\n        # but in this model with monotonic S, this should not occur.\n        # As a safeguard, return the midpoint.\n        return 0.5 * (a + b)\n\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        m = 0.5 * (a + b)\n        fm = F(m)\n        if abs(fm) <= tol or (b - a) <= tol:\n            return float(m)\n        if fm > 0.0:\n            b, fb = m, fm\n        else:\n            a, fa = m, fm\n    # If not converged within max_iter, return midpoint\n    return float(0.5 * (a + b))\n\ndef solve():\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each tuple: (L, W0, lam, Theta, KD, DA, mu)\n    test_cases = [\n        (1000.0, 0.05, 200.0, 0.6, 10.0,   0.0, 150.0),  # Case A\n        (1000.0, 0.05, 200.0, 0.6, 10.0,  30.0, 150.0),  # Case B\n        (1000.0, 0.05, 200.0, 0.6, 10.0, 100.0, 150.0),  # Case C\n        (1000.0, 0.05, 200.0, 0.6, 10.0,  30.0,  50.0),  # Case D\n        (1000.0, 0.05, 200.0, 0.03,10.0,  30.0, 150.0),  # Case E\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        L, W0, lam, Theta, KD, DA, mu = case\n\n        # Baseline boundary without Dkk1\n        x0 = baseline_boundary(L, W0, lam, Theta)\n\n        # Boundary with Dkk1\n        x_star = boundary_with_dkk(L, W0, lam, Theta, KD, DA, mu)\n\n        # Shift\n        delta_x = x_star - x0\n        results.append(delta_x)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2618612"}]}
