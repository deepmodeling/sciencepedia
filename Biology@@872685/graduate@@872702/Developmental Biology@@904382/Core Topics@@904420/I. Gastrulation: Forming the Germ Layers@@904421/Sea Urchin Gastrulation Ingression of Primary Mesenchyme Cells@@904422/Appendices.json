The problem is well-posed, providing a first-order linear ordinary differential equation with sufficient conditions ($F(0)$ and $F(12)$) to uniquely determine the unknown parameter $k$. It is objective, complete, and contains no contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe process of cadherin removal is described by the first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = -k C(t)\n$$\nwhere $C(t)$ is the amount of cadherin at time $t$ and $k$ is the rate constant. This is a separable differential equation.

We can express this relationship as:\n$$\nF(t) = \\alpha C(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a constant of proportionality. Consequently, the initial fluorescence at $t=0$ is $F(0) = \\alpha C(0)$.\n\nWe can now express the fluorescence at time $t$ in terms of the initial fluorescence:\n$$\nF(t) = \\alpha \\left(C(0) \\exp(-kt)\\right) = (\\alpha C(0)) \\exp(-kt) = F(0) \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the proportionality constant $\\alpha$ is not required for the solution, as it cancels when considering the ratio of fluorescence values.
