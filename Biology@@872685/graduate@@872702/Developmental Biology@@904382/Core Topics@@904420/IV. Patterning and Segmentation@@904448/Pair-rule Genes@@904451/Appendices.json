From first principles of transcriptional regulation consistent with the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) $\\rightarrow$ messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) $\\rightarrow$ protein), we assume the following minimal, well-tested principles: transcription factors bind DNA at enhancers, activators increase transcription rate, repressors decrease it, and in a coarse-grained description the net transcriptional input can be approximated by an additive score that is compared to a threshold to determine whether transcription proceeds.\n\nConsider a schematic embryo of length normalized to the interval $[0,100]$ (arbitrary units of percent egg length), partitioned into $14$ equal, contiguous windows $W_1, W_2, \\ldots, W_{14}$ from anterior ($W_1$) to posterior ($W_{14}$). Four gap regulators are provided: two activators $A_1$ and $A_2$, and two repressors $R_1$ and $R_2$. Each regulator is either HIGH ($1$) or LOW ($0$) within a window.

None of these indices are consecutive. For example, window $W_3$ lies between $W_2$ and $W_4$, and the gene is OFF in $W_3$. Therefore, each ON window is an isolated window. According to the problem definition, each of these $7$ isolated ON windows defines a non-overlapping stripe center.\n\nThe set of windows corresponding to the seven non-overlapping stripe centers is therefore $\\{ W_2, W_4, W_6, W_8, W_{10}, W_{12}, W_{14} \\}$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. $W_{2}, W_{4}, W_{6}, W_{8}, W_{10}, W_{12}, W_{14}$**\n    This set exactly matches the set of windows where the gene expression is ON, as derived from the model.

Let the embryo length be normalized to the interval from anterior at coordinate $x=0$ to posterior at coordinate $x=1$. Assume the following well-tested facts as the fundamental base: transcription is regulated by transcription factor concentrations whose effects on transcriptional output can be approximated as additive near threshold, and stripe positions are set by a threshold condition on a net regulatory input.\n\nLet the net input to the stripe 3 enhancer be modeled locally as\n$$\nI(x) \\;=\\; w_{A}\\,A(x) \\;-\\; w_{K}\\,K(x-\\mu_{K}) \\;-\\; \\theta,\n$$\nwhere $A(x)$ is the activator input that varies slowly with $x$ in the neighborhood of the stripe position, $K(x-\\mu_{K})$ is the Krüppel input shaped as a fixed-profile function centered at position $\\mu_{K}$, $w_{A}$ and $w_{K}$ are positive weights, and $\\theta$ is a fixed threshold.

The language is objective and the setup is self-contained and internally consistent. There are no violations of scientific principles, no ambiguities, and the premises are not factually incorrect. The problem is a valid exercise in quantitative modeling.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will now be derived.\n\nLet the initial state of the system be denoted by subscript $1$. The Krüppel profile is centered at $\\mu_{K,1}$, and the *eve* stripe 3 is centered at $x_1^{\\ast}$. The position of the stripe is defined by the condition $I(x_1^{\\ast}) = 0$.\n$$I_1(x_1^{\\ast}) = w_{A}\\,A(x_1^{\\ast}) - w_{K}\\,K(x_1^{\\ast}-\\mu_{K,1}) - \\theta = 0$$\nThe problem states that the activator profile $A(x)$ varies slowly. We can therefore approximate its value as a constant, $A_0$, in the local region of the stripe.\n$$w_{A}\\,A_0 - w_{K}\\,K(x_1^{\\ast}-\\mu_{K,1}) - \\theta = 0$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to express the value of the Krüppel concentration at the stripe's center:\n$$K(x_1^{\\ast}-\\mu_{K,1}) = \\frac{w_{A}\\,A_0 - \\theta}{w_K}$$\nThe right-hand side of this equation is a constant value determined by the fixed parameters of the system ($w_A$, $w_K$, $\\theta$) and the local activator level ($A_0$). Let us denote this critical concentration of Krüppel as $K_{crit}$.\n$$K(x_1^{\\ast}-\\mu_{K,1}) = K_{crit}$$\nThis equation signifies that the stripe boundary is formed at the spatial position where the Krüppel concentration drops to a specific threshold level, $K_{crit}$.\n\nNext, we consider the perturbed state, denoted by subscript $2$. The Krüppel profile undergoes a rigid anterior shift. An anterior shift corresponds to a decrease in the position coordinate $x$. The magnitude of the shift is $25\\%$ of the FWHM, $W$.\nThe initial FWHM is given as $W = 0.20$. The magnitude of the shift is therefore:\n$$|\\Delta \\mu_K| = 0.25 \\times W = 0.25 \\times 0.20 = 0.050$$\nSince the shift is anteriorly (towards $x=0$), the change in the center position is negative:\n$$\\Delta \\mu_K = -0.050$$\nThe new center of the Krüppel profile is $\\mu_{K,2} = \\mu_{K,1} + \\Delta \\mu_K$.\n\nThe problem states that there are no other changes to the inputs. This implies that the functions $A(x)$ and $K(\\cdot)$, and the parameters $w_A$, $w_K$, and $\\theta$ remain unchanged. The new stripe center, $x_2^{\\ast}$, is found by solving $I_2(x_2^{\\ast}) = 0$.\n$$I_2(x_2^{\\ast}) = w_{A}\\,A(x_2^{\\ast}) - w_{K}\\,K(x_2^{\\ast}-\\mu_{K,2}) - \\theta = 0$$\nAgain, applying the approximation that $A(x)$ is constant in the local region, $A(x_2^{\\ast}) \\approx A_0$. The condition for the new stripe center becomes:\n$$K(x_2^{\\ast}-\\mu_{K,2}) = \\frac{w_{A}\\,A_0 - \\theta}{w_K} = K_{crit}$$\nWe now have two conditions, one for the initial state and one for the perturbed state:\n1. $K(x_1^{\\ast}-\\mu_{K,1}) = K_{crit}$\n2. $K(x_2^{\\ast}-\\mu_{K,2}) = K_{crit}$\n\nThe problem specifies that the Krüppel profile undergoes a \"rigid translation without a change in shape\". This means the function $K$ is the same in both cases. For the function to yield the same output value $K_{crit}$, its argument must be the same in both instances.\n$$x_1^{\\ast} - \\mu_{K,1} = x_2^{\\ast} - \\mu_{K,2}$$\nThis equation reveals that the position of the stripe center relative to the center of the Krüppel domain is an invariant of the system. We wish to find the shift of the stripe center, $\\Delta x^{\\ast} = x_2^{\\ast} - x_1^{\\ast}$. Rearranging the equation above yields:\n$$x_2^{\\ast} - x_1^{\\ast} = \\mu_{K,2} - \\mu_{K,1}$$\n$$\\Delta x^{\\ast} = \\Delta \\mu_K$$\nThis result demonstrates that under the assumptions of the model, the *eve* stripe 3 center must shift by the exact same amount as the Krüppel repressor domain. The stripe follows the repressor boundary that defines it.\nSubstituting the calculated value for the shift of the Krüppel profile:\n$$\\Delta x^{\\ast} = -0.050$$\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of this shift, $|\\Delta x^{\\ast}|$.\n$$|\\Delta x^{\\ast}| = |-0.050| = 0.050$$\nThe value must be reported rounded to three significant figures. The number $0.050$ has two significant figures. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $0.0500$.\nThe magnitude of the predicted positional change is $0.0500$ in fractional embryo length units.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.0500}\n$$", "id": "2660402"}, {"introduction": "A developmental pattern is not merely a static blueprint but a stable state of a dynamic network of interacting genes.

It is well-posed, providing a clear, objective, and computationally verifiable task. The system of equations, parameters, and criteria are all explicitly defined, making the problem self-contained and unambiguous. It is a standard exercise in the stability analysis of dynamical systems in mathematical biology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to a rigorous analytical and computational solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe core of the problem is to find a specific type of steady state for a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and test its linear stability. Let the state vector be $\\mathbf{x} = (E_A, F_A, E_B, F_B)^T$. A steady state $\\mathbf{x}^\\ast$ is a fixed point of the system, where $\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \\mathbf{0}$. This leads to a system of four nonlinear algebraic equations.\n\nLet us denote the right-hand side of the system of ODEs as a vector function $\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{x})$. The steady state $\\mathbf{x}^\\ast$ must satisfy $\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{x}^\\ast) = \\mathbf{0}$:\n$$\n0 \\;=\\; \\frac{\\alpha\\,(1+b)}{1 + \\left(\\frac{F_A^\\ast}{K}\\right)^{n}} \\;-\\; (\\delta+2D)\\,E_A^\\ast \\;+\\; 2D\\,E_B^\\ast\n$$\n$$\n0 \\;=\\; \\frac{\\alpha\\,(1-b)}{1 + \\left(\\frac{E_A^\\ast}{K}\\right)^{n}} \\;-\\; (\\delta+2D)\\,F_A^\\ast \\;+\\; 2D\\,F_B^\\ast\n$$\n$$\n0 \\;=\\; \\frac{\\alpha\\,(1-b)}{1 + \\left(\\frac{F_B^\\ast}{K}\\right)^{n}} \\;-\\; (\\delta+2D)\\,E_B^\\ast \\;+\\; 2D\\,E_A^\\ast\n$$\n$$\n0 \\;=\\; \\frac{\\alpha\\,(1+b)}{1 + \\left(\\frac{E_B^\\ast}{K}\\right)^{n}} \\;-\\; (\\delta+2D)\\,F_B^\\ast \\;+\\; 2D\\,F_A^\\ast\n$$\nThis system cannot be solved analytically in general. A numerical root-finding algorithm is required. We will employ a standard algorithm, such as the HYBR method, which is a modification of Powell's hybrid method. A good initial guess is essential for convergence to the desired alternating stripe solution. Based on the model's structure, we expect $E_A$ and $F_B$ to be high, and $F_A$ and $E_B$ to be low. A plausible initial guess is $E_A^0 \\approx \\alpha/\\delta$, $F_B^0 \\approx \\alpha/\\delta$, and $F_A^0, E_B^0$ to be small positive values.\n\nOnce a candidate steady state $\\mathbf{x}^\\ast$ is found, it must be validated against the problem's criteria:\n1.  **Physicality:** $E_A^\\ast, F_A^\\ast, E_B^\\ast, F_B^\\ast \\ge 0$. Any solution with negative concentrations is unphysical and must be rejected.\n2.  **Contrast:** The inequalities $E_A^\\ast - E_B^\\ast \\ge \\theta$ and $F_B^\\ast - F_A^\\ast \\ge \\theta$ must hold.\n\nIf these criteria are met, we proceed to the linear stability analysis. This requires the Jacobian matrix $J$ of the system, defined as $J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial G_i}{\\partial x_j}$, evaluated at the steady state $\\mathbf{x}^\\ast$. The system is linearly stable if and only if all eigenvalues of $J(\\mathbf{x}^\\ast)$ have strictly negative real parts.\n\nLet us define the Hill inhibition function as $H(x; K, n) = \\frac{1}{1 + (x/K)^n}$. Its derivative with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\nH'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{K}\\right)^n\\right)^{-1} \\right] = - \\frac{n x^{n-1}}{K^n} \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{K}\\right)^n\\right)^{-2}\n$$\nThe components of the vector function $\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{x})$ are:\n$G_1(\\mathbf{x}) = \\alpha(1+b)H(F_A;K,n) - (\\delta+2D)E_A + 2DE_B$\n$G_2(\\mathbf{x}) = \\alpha(1-b)H(E_A;K,n) - (\\delta+2D)F_A + 2DF_B$\n$G_3(\\mathbf{x}) = \\alpha(1-b)H(F_B;K,n) - (\\delta+2D)E_B + 2DE_A$\n$G_4(\\mathbf{x}) = \\alpha(1+b)H(E_B;K,n) - (\\delta+2D)F_B + 2DF_A$\n\nThe analytical Jacobian matrix $J$ is obtained by taking the partial derivatives of $G_1, G_2, G_3, G_4$ with respect to $E_A, F_A, E_B, F_B$:\n$$\nJ(\\mathbf{x}) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-(\\delta+2D) & \\alpha(1+b)H'(F_A) & 2D & 0 \\\\\n\\alpha(1-b)H'(E_A) & -(\\delta+2D) & 0 & 2D \\\\\n2D & 0 & -(\\delta+2D) & \\alpha(1-b)H'(F_B) \\\\\n0 & 2D & \\alpha(1+b)H'(E_B) & -(\\delta+2D)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe algorithm for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Numerically solve the system $\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{0}$ to find a candidate steady state $\\mathbf{x}^\\ast$.\n2.  If the solver fails, or if the solution $\\mathbf{x}^\\ast$ contains negative values, the case fails.\n3.  Verify if $\\mathbf{x}^\\ast$ satisfies the contrast criterion. If not, the case fails.\n4.  If the above checks pass, construct the Jacobian matrix $J(\\mathbf{x}^\\ast)$ using the analytical formula.\n5.  Compute the eigenvalues of $J(\\mathbf{x}^\\ast)$.\n6.  If the real part of every eigenvalue is strictly negative, the steady state is stable, and the case succeeds (returns `true`). Otherwise, the case fails (returns `false`).\n\nThis procedure will be implemented for each of the provided parameter sets to determine the final Boolean outcomes.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import root\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem for the given test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Test suite: parameter tuples (alpha, delta, K, n, D, b, theta)\n    test_cases = [\n        (2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 3.0, 0.02, 0.3, 0.2),  # Case 1\n        (2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 3.0, 0.25, 0.3, 0.2),  # Case 2\n        (2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 3.0, 0.08, 0.3, 0.2),  # Case 3\n        (2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.02, 0.3, 0.2),  # Case 4\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for params in test_cases:\n        result = check_stable_alternating_state(*params)\n        results.append(result)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\".lower())\n\ndef check_stable_alternating_state(alpha, delta, K, n, D, b, theta):\n    \"\"\"\n    For a given parameter set, determines if a stable alternating stripe steady state exists.\n    \"\"\"\n    params = (alpha, delta, K, n, D, b)\n\n    # Initial guess for the root-finder.
