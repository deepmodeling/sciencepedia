A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe task is to derive the characteristic length scale, $\\ell$, that governs the spatial decay of the morphogen concentration, $c(x)$, at steady state and away from the source region. The governing equation is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients:\n$$\nD\\,\\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - \\lambda\\,c = 0\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged as:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} = \\frac{\\lambda}{D}\\,c\n$$\nFor this equation to be dimensionally consistent, the coefficient $\\frac{\\lambda}{D}$ must have dimensions of inverse length squared, $[L]^{-2}$. We can verify this from the given units. The units of $D$ are $[L]^2[T]^{-1}$ (e.g., $\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$) and the units of $\\lambda$ are $[T]^{-1}$ (e.g., $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$).

A differential equation of the form $\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} = k y$ where $k  0$ has solutions that are combinations of exponential functions, $y(x) = A \\exp(\\sqrt{k}x) + B \\exp(-\\sqrt{k}x)$. The term $\\sqrt{k}$ in the exponent determines the characteristic length scale over which the function $y(x)$ changes. Specifically, the characteristic length $\\ell$ is the distance over which the solution decays by a factor of $e$, and it is equal to $1/\\sqrt{k}$.\n\nIn our problem, the role of $k$ is played by the term $\\frac{\\lambda}{D}$.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**Part 1: State-Transition Model and System of ODEs**\n\nThe dynamics of the cell populations are governed by the balance of fluxes between the three zones. For each zone, the rate of change of its cell number is the sum of influx rates from other zones minus the sum of outflux rates to other zones. Based on the principle of first-order kinetics, the flux from a zone $i$ to a zone $j$ is given by the product of the per-capita rate $k_{ij}$ and the number of cells in the source zone, $i(t)$.\n\nThe system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is constructed as follows:\n\nFor the central zone, $C(t)$:\nThe influx is from the peripheral zone, $P(t)$, at a rate of $k_{PC}P(t)$, and from the rib meristem, $R(t)$, at a rate of $k_{RC}R(t)$.\nThe outflux is to the peripheral zone at a rate of $k_{CP}C(t)$ and to the rib meristem at a rate of $k_{CR}C(t)$.\nThus, the differential equation for $C(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = k_{PC}P(t) + k_{RC}R(t) - (k_{CP} + k_{CR})C(t) $$\n\nFor the peripheral zone, $P(t)$:\nThe influx is from $C(t)$ at a rate of $k_{CP}C(t)$ and from $R(t)$ at a rate of $k_{RP}R(t)$.\nThe outflux is to $C(t)$ at a rate of $k_{PC}P(t)$ and to $R(t)$ at a rate of $k_{PR}P(t)$.\nThus, the differential equation for $P(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = k_{CP}C(t) + k_{RP}R(t) - (k_{PC} + k_{PR})P(t) $$\n\nFor the rib meristem, $R(t)$:\nThe influx is from $C(t)$ at a rate of $k_{CR}C(t)$ and from $P(t)$ at a rate of $k_{PR}P(t)$.\nThe outflux is to $C(t)$ at a rate of $k_{RC}R(t)$ and to $P(t)$ at a rate of $k_{RP}R(t)$.\nThus, the differential equation for $R(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = k_{CR}C(t) + k_{PR}P(t) - (k_{RC} + k_{RP})R(t) $$\n\nWe verify that the total cell number $N = C(t) + P(t) + R(t)$ is conserved by summing the three ODEs:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = \\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{dP}{dt} + \\frac{dR}{dt} = 0 $$\nThe sum of all terms on the right-hand side is indeed zero, confirming the conservation of $N$.\n\n**Part 2: Steady-State Fraction $f_C$**\n\nAt steady state, the cell numbers are constant, so the time derivatives are zero: $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$, $\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0$, $\\frac{dR}{dt} = 0$.

For all cases, report the list of indices of newly initiated primordia as integers, in chronological order as defined above.\n\n- Case A (happy path, new primordia expected):\n  - $N = 60$, $T = 80$, $D = 0.2$, $I_0 = 0.06$, $\\lambda = 0.05$, $\\alpha = 0.8$, $\\beta = 0.2$, $A_0 = 1.0$, $\\tau = 20.0$, $\\sigma = 4.0$, $\\theta = 0.95$, $r = 5$, $\\rho = 0.2$, $a_{\\text{init}} = 0.1$.\n  - Initial primordia: indices $[0, 22, 44]$ with corresponding initial ages $[40, 25, 10]$.\n- Case B (boundary threshold equal to steady import/clearance ratio; no initiations expected because $a_i(t)$ approaches but does not exceed the steady level):\n  - Identical to Case A except $\\theta = 1.2$ and $T = 200$.\n  - Note: The import/clearance steady level away from inhibition is $I_0 / \\lambda = 1.2$.\n- Case C (strong, broad inhibition suppresses import globally; no initiations expected):\n  - $N = 60$, $T = 120$, $D = 0.2$, $I_0 = 0.06$, $\\lambda = 0.05$, $\\alpha = 1.0$, $\\beta = 0.3$, $A_0 = 1.0$, $\\tau = 200.0$, $\\sigma = 12.0$, $\\theta = 0.8$, $r = 5$, $\\rho = 0.2$, $a_{\\text{init}} = 0.1$.\n  - Initial primordia: indices $[0, 20, 40]$ with corresponding initial ages $[0, 0, 0]$.\n- Case D (exclusion radius covers the whole small ring; no initiations possible by geometry):\n  - $N = 6$, $T = 100$, $D = 0.2$, $I_0 = 0.06$, $\\lambda = 0.05$, $\\alpha = 0.8$, $\\beta = 0.2$, $A_0 = 1.0$, $\\tau = 20.0$, $\\sigma = 2.0$, $\\theta = 0.6$, $r = 3$, $\\rho = 0.2$, $a_{\\text{init}} = 0.1$.\n  - Initial primordia: indices $[0, 3]$ with corresponding initial ages $[10, 10]$.\n\nAngle units are not used. All reported results are integers (indices) and lists of integers. No percentages are involved.\n\nYour program must implement the above rules and produce exactly one line: a single bracketed list of the four per-case lists of initiated indices, with no spaces anywhere in the line.", "solution": "The problem presented is a request to construct and simulate a discrete-time, discrete-space mathematical model of phyllotaxis, which is the formation of primordia (such as leaves or flowers) at the Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM) of a plant. The model is based on the dynamics of the plant hormone auxin. Before proceeding to the solution, a rigorous validation of the problem statement is required.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe system is defined by the following components:\n- **Domain**: A ring of $N$ cells, indexed $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$ with periodic boundaries.\n- **State Variable**: Auxin concentration $a_i(t)$ in cell $i$ at time step $t$.\n- **Update Rule**: The change in auxin concentration is given by the explicit forward Euler discretization:\n$$a_i(t+1) = a_i(t) + \\Delta a_i(t),$$\nwhere the total change $\\Delta a_i(t)$ is the sum of several terms:\n$$ \\Delta a_i(t) = \\underbrace{D (a_{i-1}(t) - 2 a_i(t) + a_{i+1}(t))}_{\\text{Diffusion}} + \\underbrace{\\max\\{ I_0 (1 - \\alpha S_i(t)), 0 \\}}_{\\text{Inhibited Import}} \\underbrace{- \\lambda a_i(t)}_{\\text{Clearance}} \\underbrace{- \\beta S_i(t) a_i(t)}_{\\text{Inhibitory Sink}}. $$\n- **Non-negativity**: $a_i(t+1)$ is clipped to $0$ if its calculated value is negative.\n- **Inhibitory Field**: The field $S_i(t)$ at cell $i$ is a sum of contributions from all existing primordia $p$ in the set $\\mathcal{P}(t)$:\n$$ S_i(t) = \\sum_{p \\in \\mathcal{P}(t)} A_0 \\exp\\Big(-\\frac{\\tau_p(t)}{\\tau}\\Big) \\exp\\Big(-\\frac{d(i,j_p)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}\\Big), $$\nwhere $j_p$ is the position and $\\tau_p(t)$ is the age of primordium $p$. The distance $d(i, j_p)$ is the shortest wrap-around distance on the ring: $d(i,j_p) = \\min\\{|i - j_p|, N - |i - j_p|\\}$.\n- **Parameters**: $N, T, D, I_0, \\lambda, \\alpha, \\beta, A_0, \\tau, \\sigma, \\theta, r, \\rho, a_{\\text{init}}$.\n- **Initial Conditions**: $a_i(0) = a_{\\text{init}}$ for all $i$. The set of initial primordia $\\mathcal{P}(0)$ is given with their positions and ages.\n- **Primordium Initiation Conditions**: A new primordium forms at cell $i$ at time $t$ if and only if:\n    1. $a_i(t)  \\theta$ (Threshold).\n    2. $a_i(t)  a_{i-1}(t)$ and $a_i(t)  a_{i+1}(t)$ (Local Maximum).\n    3. $d(i, j_p) \\ge r$ for all $p \\in \\mathcal{P}(t)$ (Exclusion Radius).\n- **Conflict Resolution for Multiple Initiations**: If multiple cells meet the criteria, they are sorted by descending $a_i(t)$ (primary key) and ascending index $i$ (tie-breaker). A greedy selection process accepts candidates from this list, ensuring each new initiation site is at least a distance $r$ from all previously accepted sites *within the same time step*.\n- **Post-Initiation Events**: For each new primordium at index $i$:\n    1. It is added to the set of primordia with age $0$.\n    2. The local auxin is reset: $a_i(t) \\leftarrow \\rho \\, a_i(t)$. This reset value is used in the calculation for the next time step, $a_j(t+1)$.\n- **Time Evolution**: Ages of all primordia are incremented by $1$ at the end of each time step.\n- **Output**: A list of lists, where each inner list contains the indices of newly initiated primordia for a given test case, ordered chronologically and then by index.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem is evaluated against the established validation criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The model is a form of a reaction-diffusion system, a classic and powerful framework in theoretical biology for explaining pattern formation. The specific mechanisms—auxin transport, accumulation, and inhibition from existing structures—are central to the established theory of phyllotaxis. The mathematical formulation (discrete Laplacian, exponential decay, Gaussian kernels) is standard and appropriate. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is deterministic. All parameters, initial conditions, and rules of evolution are specified unambiguously. The procedure for handling multiple simultaneous initiations, including sorting and greedy selection, ensures a unique outcome. The system is well-posed.\n- **Objective**: The problem statement is written in precise, objective, and mathematical language. There are no subjective or opinion-based elements.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: All necessary parameters and initial conditions are provided for each test case. The rules are internally consistent. The order of operations within a time step is logical: check for initiations based on the current state, resolve conflicts, update the state (auxin reset and primordia list), and then compute the next state.\n- **Feasibility**: The model is a straightforward numerical simulation. The choice of diffusion coefficient $D=0.2$ with effective time step $\\Delta t=1$ and space step $\\Delta x=1$ satisfies the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition for an explicit diffusion scheme ($D \\Delta t / (\\Delta x)^2 \\le 0.5$), suggesting numerical stability. The test cases are well-designed to probe different regimes of the model's behavior.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-defined, scientifically relevant, and numerically tractable problem in computational developmental biology. I will therefore proceed to construct the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Implementation Strategy\n\nThe solution requires implementing a discrete-time simulation according to the specified rules. The core of the implementation will be a loop that iterates through time from $t=0$ to $T-1$. Within each time step, the following sequence of operations must be performed precisely as specified.\n\n**Algorithm Outline:**\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    - Initialize the auxin concentration array `a` of size $N$ with the value $a_{\\text{init}}$.\n    - Initialize the list of primordia, `primordia`, from the given initial positions and ages. Each primordium will be stored as a tuple `(position, age)`.\n    - Initialize an empty list, `all_new_primordia_indices`, to collect the results.\n\n2.  **Time-Stepping Loop** (for $t$ from $0$ to $T-1$):\n    a.  **Calculate Inhibition Field $S(t)$**:\n        - Create a zero array `S` of size $N$.\n        - For each primordium $(j_p, \\tau_p)$ in the current `primordia` list:\n            - Calculate the age-dependent amplitude: $A_p = A_0 \\exp(-\\tau_p / \\tau)$.\n            - For each cell $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, N-1\\}$:\n                - Compute the periodic distance $d(i, j_p)$.\n                - Add the contribution to the inhibition field: $S[i] \\leftarrow S[i] + A_p \\exp(-d(i, j_p)^2 / (2\\sigma^2))$.\n\n    b.  **Identify Initiation Candidates**:\n        - Create an empty list `candidates`.\n        - For each cell $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, N-1\\}$:\n            - Check the three initiation conditions:\n                i.  $a_i(t)  \\theta$.\n                ii. $a_i(t)  a_{i-1}(t)$ and $a_i(t)  a_{i+1}(t)$ (using periodic indices).\n                iii. For all primordia $(j_p, \\tau_p)$, $d(i, j_p) \\ge r$.\n            - If all conditions are satisfied, add the tuple `(a[i], i)` to `candidates`.\n\n    c.  **Select New Primordia (Greedy Selection)**:\n        - Sort `candidates` in descending order of auxin concentration, with ascending index as a tie-breaker.\n        - Create an empty list `new_primordia_this_step` to store the indices of primordia initiated in the current time step.\n        - Iterate through the sorted `candidates`: for each candidate $(a_{\\text{cand}}, i_{\\text{cand}})$:\n            - Check if $i_{\\text{cand}}$ is at least a distance $r$ from all indices already in `new_primordia_this_step`.\n            - If it is compatible, add $i_{\\text{cand}}$ to `new_primordia_this_step`.\n        - Sort `new_primordia_this_step` by index in ascending order and append its elements to `all_new_primordia_indices`.\n\n    d.  **Update State for Next Time Step**:\n        - Create a copy of the current auxin array `a`, let's call it `a_update`, to be used for the calculation. This preserves the original `a(t)` for the update rule calculation while allowing for local resets.\n        - For each newly initiated primordium index $i$ in `new_primordia_this_step`:\n            - Apply the auxin reset: $a_{\\text{update}}[i] \\leftarrow \\rho \\cdot a_{\\text{update}}[i]$.\n        - Create a new list for primordia at time $t+1$, `next_primordia`.\n        - Add newly formed primordia to `next_primordia`, each with age $0$.\n        - Add all existing primordia from the `primordia` list to `next_primordia`, with their ages incremented by $1$.\n        - Replace the old `primordia` list with `next_primordia`.\n\n    e.  **Compute Auxin Concentrations for $t+1$**:\n        - Create a new array `a_next` of size $N$.\n        - For each cell $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, N-1\\}$:\n            - Calculate the discrete Laplacian (diffusion term) using values from `a_update`.\n            - Calculate the import, clearance, and inhibitory sink terms using values from `a_update` and the field `S`.\n            - Sum all terms to find $a_{\\text{next}}[i]$ according to the update rule.\n        - Apply the non-negativity constraint: $a \\leftarrow \\max(a_{\\text{next}}, 0)$.\n\n3.  **Finalization**:\n    - After the loop completes, return `all_new_primordia_indices`.\n\nThis algorithm will be implemented in Python using the `numpy` library for efficient array operations, which is critical for the performance of the simulation. The final program will encapsulate this logic and apply it to each of the four provided test cases, formatting the output string as required.", "answer": "[[11,33,55],[],[],[]]", "id": "2671825"}]}
