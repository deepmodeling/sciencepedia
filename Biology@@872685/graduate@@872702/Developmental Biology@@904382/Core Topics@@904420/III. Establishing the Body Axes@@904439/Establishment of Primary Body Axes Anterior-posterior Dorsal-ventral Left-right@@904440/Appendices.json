It is scientifically sound and free of speculation.\n- **Well-Posed**: A second-order ordinary differential equation is provided along with a source term and two boundary conditions (one at $+\\infty$ and one at $-\\infty$). This setup is sufficient to determine a unique, stable solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical and biological language. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\nAll other validation criteria are met. The problem is not incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, ill-posed, or trivial. It is a formalizable and relevant problem.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the provided partial differential equation for the morphogen concentration $C(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} C(x,t) = D\\,\\partial_{xx} C(x,t) - k\\,C(x,t) + J\\,\\delta(x)\n$$\nIn the steady state, the concentration profile no longer changes with time, which means $\\partial_{t} C(x,t) = 0$. The concentration becomes a function of position only, $C(x)$. The governing equation simplifies to a second-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\nD\\,\\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - k\\,C(x) + J\\,\\delta(x) = 0\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged as:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - \\frac{k}{D}\\,C(x) = -\\frac{J}{D}\\,\\delta(x)\n$$\nWe examine the dimensions of the coefficients. The diffusion coefficient $D$ has units of $[L]^2[T]^{-1}$, and the degradation rate constant $k$ has units of $[T]^{-1}$. Therefore, the term $k/D$ has units of $([T]^{-1})/([L]^2[T]^{-1}) = [L]^{-2}$. It is thus natural to define a quantity with the dimension of length, the characteristic length $\\lambda$, such that $\\lambda^{-2} = k/D$. This gives the definition from first principles, as requested:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}}\n$$\nSubstituting this definition, the steady-state equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}\\,C(x) = -\\frac{J}{D}\\,\\delta(x)\n$$\nWe must solve this equation. For any region where $x \\neq 0$, the Dirac delta term $\\delta(x)$ is zero. The equation simplifies to a homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}\\,C(x) = 0 \\quad (\\text{for } x \\neq 0)\n$$\nThe characteristic equation for this ODE is $r^2 - \\lambda^{-2} = 0$, which has roots $r = \\pm 1/\\lambda$. The general solution is therefore a linear combination of exponential functions:\n$$\nC(x) = A\\,\\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) + B\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nThis general form must satisfy the boundary condition that $C(x) \\to 0$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$. We must consider the regions $x>0$ and $x<0$ separately.\n\nFor $x > 0$: As $x \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp(x/\\lambda)$ diverges. For the concentration to vanish, its coefficient must be zero. Thus, for $x > 0$, the solution must have the form $C(x) = B_1\\,\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$.\n\nFor $x < 0$: As $x \\to -\\infty$, the term $\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$ diverges. For the concentration to vanish, its coefficient must be zero. Thus, for $x < 0$, the solution must have the form $C(x) = A_2\\,\\exp(x/\\lambda)$.\n\nWe can combine these two forms using the absolute value function, which is valid due to the symmetry of the problem around $x=0$.\n$$\nC(x) = A\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nThis form satisfies the boundary conditions at $\\pm\\infty$ and also imposes the physical requirement of continuity at the origin, $C(0^+) = C(0^-) = A$.\n\nTo determine the constant $A$, we must account for the source term $J\\,\\delta(x)$. We integrate the full steady-state equation across an infinitesimal interval $[-\\epsilon, \\epsilon]$ around the origin:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\left( D\\,\\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - k\\,C(x) + J\\,\\delta(x) \\right) dx = 0\n$$\n$$\nD \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{d^2C}{dx^2}\\,dx - k \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} C(x)\\,dx + J \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\delta(x)\\,dx = 0\n$$\nEvaluating each integral in the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$:\n1. $D \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{d^2C}{dx^2}\\,dx = D \\left[ \\frac{dC}{dx} \\right]_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} = D \\left( \\left.\\frac{dC}{dx}\\right|_{x=\\epsilon} - \\left.\\frac{dC}{dx}\\right|_{x=-\\epsilon} \\right)$. This term represents the discontinuity in the diffusive flux across the source.\n2. $k \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} C(x)\\,dx \\to 0$ because $C(x)$ is continuous and bounded at $x=0$, so the integral over an interval of vanishing width is zero.\n3. $J \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\delta(x)\\,dx = J$, by definition of the Dirac delta distribution.\n\nThus, the integrated equation yields the jump condition for the derivative at the origin:\n$$\nD \\left( \\left.\\frac{dC}{dx}\\right|_{x=0^+} - \\left.\\frac{dC}{dx}\\right|_{x=0^-} \\right) + J = 0\n$$\nNow we compute the derivatives from our solution $C(x) = A\\,\\exp(-|x|/\\lambda)$:\n- For $x > 0$, $C(x) = A\\,\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, so $\\frac{dC}{dx} = -\\frac{A}{\\lambda}\\,\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$. At $x=0^+$, $\\left.\\frac{dC}{dx}\\right|_{x=0^+} = -A/\\lambda$.\n- For $x < 0$, $C(x) = A\\,\\exp(x/\\lambda)$, so $\\frac{dC}{dx} = \\frac{A}{\\lambda}\\,\\exp(x/\\lambda)$. At $x=0^-$, $\\left.\\frac{dC}{dx}\\right|_{x=0^-} = A/\\lambda$.\n\nSubstituting these into the jump condition:\n$$\nD \\left( \\left(-\\frac{A}{\\lambda}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{A}{\\lambda}\\right) \\right) + J = 0\n$$\n$$\nD \\left( -\\frac{2A}{\\lambda} \\right) = -J\n$$\n$$\nA = \\frac{J\\lambda}{2D}\n$$\nNow we substitute this expression for $A$ back into the solution for $C(x)$:\n$$\nC(x) = \\frac{J\\lambda}{2D}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, we must express the answer only in terms of the given parameters $J$, $D$, $k$, and $x$. We substitute $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$:\n$$\nC(x) = \\frac{J}{2D} \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|}{\\sqrt{D/k}}\\right)\n$$\nThe pre-factor simplifies: $\\frac{J}{2D} \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}} = \\frac{J}{2\\sqrt{D^2}} \\frac{\\sqrt{D}}{\\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{J\\sqrt{D}}{2\\sqrt{D^2}\\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{J}{2\\sqrt{Dk}}$. The term in the exponent is $-|x|\\sqrt{k/D}$.\nThis gives the final steady-state concentration profile:\n$$\nC(x) = \\frac{J}{2\\sqrt{Dk}} \\exp\\left(-|x|\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)\n$$\n**Biological Interpretation of the Characteristic Length $\\lambda$:**\nThe characteristic length $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$ is the fundamental length scale of the morphogen gradient. It emerges naturally from the competition between two processes: diffusion ($D$), which spreads the morphogen, and degradation ($k$), which removes it.\nThe derived concentration profile $C(x) \\propto \\exp(-|x|/\\lambda)$ shows that $\\lambda$ is the e-folding distance of the exponential decay. At a distance $x=\\lambda$ from the source, the morphogen concentration has decayed to $1/e$ (approximately $37\\%$) of its maximum value at the source.\nIn the context of axis specification, different cell fates are often determined by threshold concentrations of a morphogen. The value of $\\lambda$ determines the spatial extent over which the morphogen can provide positional information.\n- A large $\\lambda$ (high diffusion or low degradation) results in a shallow, long-range gradient, enabling the source to specify cell fates over a large portion of the embryonic axis.\n- A small $\\lambda$ (low diffusion or high degradation) results in a steep, short-range gradient, restricting positional information to a region very near the source.\nThus, $\\lambda$ directly controls the scale of the pattern established along the body axis.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{J}{2\\sqrt{Dk}}\\exp\\left(-|x|\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2636031"}, {"introduction": "While the simple diffusion-decay model provides a powerful intuition for gradient formation, it fails to explain how patterns can robustly scale with embryo size—a property observed in many species.

The defining characteristic of the shuttling model is its scale invariance, meaning its fractional boundary position, which we denote $p_{\\text{shuttle}}$, remains constant regardless of the total length $L$. Therefore, we have:\n$$p_{\\text{shuttle}} = p_0 = \\frac{1}{5}$$\nNext, we consider the perturbation. The embryo's length increases by $50\\%$.

The minimum value $n_{\\min}$ occurs at the equality: $\\left|\\frac{dP}{dx}\\big|_{x=L/2}\\right| = s_{c}$.\n\nWe must compute the derivative $\\frac{dP}{dx}$ and evaluate it at $x=L/2$. Using the product rule and the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}[A(B(x))R(K(x))] = R(K(x))\\frac{dA}{dx} + A(B(x))\\frac{dR}{dx}\n$$\nThe individual derivative terms are:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dx} = \\frac{dA}{dB}\\frac{dB}{dx} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dR}{dx} = \\frac{dR}{dK}\\frac{dK}{dx}\n$$\nThe derivatives of the concentration profiles are:\n$$\n\\frac{dB}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[B_{0}\\exp(-x/\\lambda_{B})\\right] = -\\frac{B_{0}}{\\lambda_{B}}\\exp(-x/\\lambda_{B}) = -\\frac{B(x)}{\\lambda_{B}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dK}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[K_{0}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - L/2)^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)\\right] = K(x) \\left(-\\frac{2(x-L/2)}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) = -\\frac{x-L/2}{\\sigma^{2}}K(x)\n$$\nA critical simplification occurs when evaluating at $x = L/2$:\n$$\n\\frac{dK}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L/2} = -\\frac{L/2 - L/2}{\\sigma^{2}}K(L/2) = 0\n$$\nConsequently, the term $\\frac{dR}{dx}$ vanishes at $x=L/2$, and the slope of $P(x)$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L/2} = R(K(L/2)) \\cdot \\frac{dA}{dB}\\bigg|_{B(L/2)} \\cdot \\frac{dB}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L/2}\n$$\nLet's find the derivative $\\frac{dA}{dB}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dB} = \\frac{d}{dB}\\left(\\frac{B^{n}}{K_{A}^{n}+B^{n}}\\right) = \\frac{nB^{n-1}(K_{A}^{n}+B^{n}) - B^{n}(nB^{n-1})}{(K_{A}^{n}+B^{n})^{2}} = \\frac{nK_{A}^{n}B^{n-1}}{(K_{A}^{n}+B^{n})^{2}}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten using $A(B) = \\frac{B^n}{K_A^n+B^n}$ and $1-A(B) = \\frac{K_A^n}{K_A^n+B^n}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dB} = \\frac{n}{B} \\frac{K_{A}^{n}B^{n}}{(K_{A}^{n}+B^{n})^{2}} = \\frac{n}{B} A(B)(1-A(B))\n$$\nNow, assemble the expression for the slope at $x=L/2$:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L/2} = R(K_{0}) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{n}{B(L/2)} A(B(L/2))(1-A(B(L/2)))\\right) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{B(L/2)}{\\lambda_{B}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L/2} = -\\frac{n}{\\lambda_{B}} R(K_{0}) A(B(L/2)) (1-A(B(L/2)))\n$$\nFrom the initial setup, we know that $P(L/2) = A(B(L/2))R(K_{0}) = 1/2$. Substituting this gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L/2} = -\\frac{n}{\\lambda_{B}} \\frac{1}{2} (1-A(B(L/2)))\n$$\nWe also previously found an expression for $A(B(L/2))$ when solving for $K_A$: $A(B(L/2)) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + (K_{0}/K_{R})^{m})$.
