Due to the leading negative sign, we conclude that $\\lambda(\\alpha) < 0$ for all $\\alpha \\ge 0$.\n\nA change in stability would occur at a bifurcation point where $\\lambda(\\alpha) = 0$. For our expression, this would require the numerator to be zero:\n$$ 2k\\sqrt{k^2 + 4sk\\alpha} = 0 $$\nSince $k>0$, this implies $k^2 + 4sk\\alpha = 0$. However, as established, $k^2 > 0$ and $4sk\\alpha \\ge 0$, so their sum is always strictly positive.\nWe conclude that $\\lambda(\\alpha)$ can never be zero. The unique positive steady state $T^{\\ast}$ is therefore stable for all values of the feedback strength $\\alpha \\ge 0$. There is no value of $\\alpha$ at which the stability of the system changes.
