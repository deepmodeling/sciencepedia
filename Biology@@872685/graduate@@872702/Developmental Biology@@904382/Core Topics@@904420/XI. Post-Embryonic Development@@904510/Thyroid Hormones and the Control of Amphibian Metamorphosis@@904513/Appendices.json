In the absence of $T_3$, TR recruits nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) and silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) complexes to repress transcription; in the presence of $T_3$, TR releases corepressors and recruits steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) and histone acetyltransferase $p300$ complexes to activate transcription. This dual-function model posits that unliganded TR prevents precocious metamorphic gene expression by repression, whereas liganded TR induces metamorphic remodeling by activation. Tissue competence is further shaped by local thyroid hormone metabolism via type $2$ deiodinase ($D_2$), which activates thyroxine (T$4$) to $T_3$, and type $3$ deiodinase ($D_3$), which inactivates $T_3$.\n\nConsider transgenic frog tadpoles ubiquitously expressing a dominant-negative TR variant engineered with an activation function helix $AF-2$ mutation that preserves DNA binding to TREs and corepressor interaction but abolishes coactivator recruitment even when $T_3$ is bound.

The $\\text{TR}$ forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor ($\\text{RXR}$). The $\\text{TR-RXR}$ complex binds to thyroid hormone response elements ($\\text{TREs}$).\n- **Dual-Function Model:**\n    - Without $\\text{T}_3$: $\\text{TR}$ binds corepressors ($\\text{NCoR}$, $\\text{SMRT}$) and represses transcription.\n    - With $\\text{T}_3$: $\\text{TR}$ releases corepressors and recruits coactivators ($\\text{SRC}$, $\\text{p}300$) to activate transcription.\n- **Local Metabolism:** Type $2$ deiodinase ($\\text{D}_2$) converts thyroxine ($\\text{T}_4$) to $\\text{T}_3$. Type $3$ deiodinase ($\\text{D}_3$) inactivates $\\text{T}_3$.\n- **Experimental System:** Transgenic tadpoles express a dominant-negative $\\text{TR}$ ($\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$) ubiquitously at metamorphic climax.\n- **Properties of $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$:**\n    1. It has a mutation in the activation function helix $\\text{AF-2}$.\n    2. It preserves DNA binding to $\\text{TREs}$.\n    3. It preserves interaction with corepressors.\n    4. It abolishes recruitment of coactivators, even when bound to $\\text{T}_3$.\n- **Mechanism of Action:** The $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ competes with endogenous, wild-type $\\text{TR}$ for binding to $\\text{TREs}$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded in the accepted molecular mechanisms of nuclear hormone receptor function and developmental endocrinology. The dual-function model of $\\text{TR}$ is a central paradigm in the field. The design of the dominant-negative receptor with a defective $\\text{AF-2}$ domain is a classic and valid experimental strategy to dissect receptor function. The setup is self-contained, logically consistent, and unambiguous. It provides all necessary information to deduce the consequences of expressing such a protein. The problem is well-posed and does not violate any principles of scientific validity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution can be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Correct Answer**\n\nThe core of the problem is to understand the function of the engineered dominant-negative receptor ($\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$) and its impact on gene expression during metamorphosis.\n\n1.  **Analysis of $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ Function:** The $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ is designed to act as a competitive inhibitor of the wild-type $\\text{TR}$ ($\\text{TR}_{\\text{WT}}$). It binds to the same DNA targets, the $\\text{TREs}$.\n    - In the absence of the hormone $\\text{T}_3$ (pre-metamorphosis), both $\\text{TR}_{\\text{WT}}$ and $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ can bind corepressors and mediate transcriptional repression. The repressed state of metamorphic genes is maintained.\n    - In the presence of $\\text{T}_3$ (metamorphic climax), the scenario changes. When $\\text{TR}_{\\text{WT}}$ binds $\\text{T}_3$, it dismisses corepressors and recruits coactivators, leading to strong transcriptional activation. When the competing $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ binds to a $\\text{TRE}$, it also binds $\\text{T}_3$ and releases corepressors (the standard action of a liganded nuclear receptor, necessary for the \"dominant negative\" effect at this stage). However, due to its $\\text{AF-2}$ mutation, it is critically unable to recruit coactivators.\n    - Consequently, at a target gene promoter occupied by $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$, the gene is derepressed but not actively transcribed. The strong \"activate\" signal from $\\text{T}_3$ is converted into a \"neutral\" or \"off\" signal. This effectively blocks the ability of $\\text{T}_3$ to induce high levels of gene expression required for metamorphosis.\n\n2.  **Application to Metamorphic Events:** Amphibian metamorphosis involves processes that are known to be dependent on robust, $\\text{T}_3$-induced gene activation, not merely the lifting of repression.\n    - **Degeneration of Larval Tissues (Tail, Gills):** These events are driven by programmed cell death (apoptosis), which is an active process requiring the synthesis of numerous proteins, such as caspases and matrix metalloproteinases. The genes encoding these proteins must be strongly activated by liganded $\\text{TR}$. The $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ will prevent this activation, thus **inhibiting** tail resorption and gill regression.\n    - **Remodeling of Larval Tissues (Intestine):** This process is complex, involving the apoptosis of the larval epithelium and the simultaneous proliferation and differentiation of adult stem cells. Both the destructive (apoptosis) and constructive (proliferation/differentiation) phases require specific sets of genes to be activated by $\\text{T}_3$. The $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ will inhibit both processes.\n    - **De Novo Growth of Adult Tissues (Limbs):** The rapid growth and patterning of limbs during metamorphic climax are critically dependent on the activation of a cascade of developmental genes by $\\text{T}_3$. Blocking this activation will severely impede or arrest limb development.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The expression of this $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ will act as a potent antagonist to $\\text{T}_3$ action, leading to a general inhibition of all major metamorphic events.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Tail resorption and gill regression proceed largely normally; apoptosis of the larval intestinal epithelium is markedly inhibited; limb growth is severely stunted. Interpretation: tail and gill remodeling rely primarily on derepression by removing corepressors, whereas intestinal and limb remodeling require transcriptional activation.**\nThis option is **Incorrect**. The prediction that tail and gill regression proceed normally is flawed. These large-scale apoptotic events require active gene expression programs, meaning they depend on transcriptional activation, not just derepression. The interpretation is based on this false premise.\n\n**B. Tail resorption and gill regression are strongly inhibited; both apoptosis of the larval intestinal epithelium and expansion of adult intestinal stem cells are inhibited; limb growth and patterning continue but are delayed. Interpretation: tail and gill remodeling require TR-dependent transcriptional activation by liganded TR, whereas limb development can proceed to a degree when derepression permits integration of non-thyroidal cues.**\nThis option is **Correct**. The predicted phenotypes (inhibition of tail, gill, and intestinal remodeling; delay/stunting of limbs) are fully consistent with the mechanism of the $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ blocking transcriptional activation. The interpretation is sound: it correctly identifies that these processes require activation by liganded $\\text{TR}$. It also provides a sophisticated and plausible explanation for a partial limb phenotype, acknowledging that other signaling pathways might have a minor effect once repression is lifted, even without full $\\text{TR}$-mediated activation. This represents the most accurate and nuanced understanding of the system.\n\n**C. All tissues exhibit precocious metamorphic changes, including accelerated tail resorption, gill regression, intestinal remodeling, and limb development. Interpretation: TR acts solely as a repressor premetamorphically, so preventing coactivator recruitment mimics derepression and advances metamorphosis.**\nThis option is **Incorrect**. The prediction of precocious metamorphosis is the opposite of the expected outcome. The $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ is an inhibitor, not an activator. The interpretation wrongly discards the essential role of coactivator-mediated transcriptional activation, which is explicitly described in the problem's dual-function model.\n\n**D. Tail resorption is strongly inhibited but gill regression is largely normal; intestinal larval epithelial apoptosis proceeds but adult stem cell expansion fails; limb development is unaffected. Interpretation: coactivator recruitment is dispensable for regression of larval tissues but required for neogenesis of adult tissues.**\nThis option is **Incorrect**. The predicted phenotypes are inconsistent. There is no sound biological reason for tail and gill regression to be differentially affected, nor for intestinal apoptosis to proceed while tail apoptosis is inhibited. The interpretation relies on the faulty premise that regression (apoptosis) does not require coactivator recruitment (activation), which contradicts the understanding of apoptosis as an active, gene-directed process.\n\n**E. No overt phenotype is expected in any tissue because endogenous $T_3$ levels are unchanged; interpretation: dominant-negative TRs require loss of hormone binding or altered deiodinase activity to affect metamorphosis, and a coactivator-deficient TR cannot interfere with endogenous TR function in vivo.**\nThis option is **Incorrect**. A ubiquitously expressed dominant-negative receptor that competes for DNA binding is expected to cause a strong phenotype. The interpretation contains multiple errors. A dominant-negative receptor does not need to lose hormone binding to function; in fact, binding the hormone but failing to activate is a common mechanism. Most critically, it incorrectly claims the $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ cannot interfere with endogenous $\\text{TR}$; its interference via competition for $\\text{TREs}$ is the very definition of its dominant-negative action.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2685189"}, {"introduction": "The orchestration of metamorphosis involves a complex interplay of signals within and between cells.

The key is the comparison between two length scales: the size of the genetic patches ($d$) and the signaling range of paracrine factors ($\\ell$). By creating conditions where $d \\ll \\ell$ and $d \\gg \\ell$, one can create distinct environments to isolate and observe cell-autonomous versus non-cell-autonomous effects.\n3.  **Objectivity and Completeness:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms ($d$, $\\ell$, concentrations, time points). All necessary information is provided to reason about the experimental outcomes from first principles. There are no contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. The solution phase will proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe core task is to distinguish two types of effects based on the provided principles.\n\n1.  **Cell-Autonomous Effect:** According to principle (i), a cell's ability to initiate the $T_3$ response program is determined by its own genotype. A $\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ (GFP$^+$) cell can respond to $T_3$. A $\\mathrm{TR}^{-/-}$ (RFP$^+$) cell cannot. In isolation, a $\\mathrm{TR}^{-/-}$ cell will not undergo apoptosis in response to $T_3$.\n\n2.  **Non-Cell-Autonomous Effect:** According to principle (ii), responding $\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ cells secrete factors (proteases, chemokines) that can influence their neighbors. This effect has a limited spatial range, $\\ell$. Therefore, a non-responding $\\mathrm{TR}^{-/-}$ cell might be induced to undergo apoptosis if it is located sufficiently close (within distance $\\ell$) to a responding $\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ cell.\n\nThis leads to a clear set of predictions based on the experimental design:\n\n*   **In controls:** An all-$\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ tail will show a high, uniform level of apoptosis (the maximal response). An all-$\\mathrm{TR}^{-/-}$ tail will show only a low, baseline level of apoptosis.\n*   **In large-patch mosaics ($d \\gg \\ell$):**\n    *   $\\mathrm{TR}^{-/-}$ (RFP$^+$) cells in the interior of a large patch, at a distance greater than $\\ell$ from any $\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ (GFP$^+$) cell, will be shielded from non-cell-autonomous signals. Their fate is purely cell-autonomous. They should exhibit only baseline apoptosis.\n    *   $\\mathrm{TR}^{-/-}$ (RFP$^+$) cells located near the boundary (within distance $\\ell$) will be exposed to signals from the adjacent $\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ cells. They should exhibit a level of apoptosis that is elevated above baseline, likely in a graded fashion depending on their proximity to the signal source.\n    *   $\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ (GFP$^+$) cells will exhibit a high level of apoptosis regardless of their location, as their response is cell-autonomous.\n*   **In small-patch mosaics ($d \\ll \\ell$):**\n    *   Since the patch size $d$ is much smaller than the signaling range $\\ell$, every cell is effectively in a mixed environment.\n    *   $\\mathrm{TR}^{-/-}$ (RFP$^+$) cells will be constantly exposed to non-cell-autonomous signals from their nearby $\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ neighbors. They should exhibit an intermediate level of apoptosis: higher than baseline, but lower than the maximal response of $\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ cells because they lack the direct, cell-autonomous pathway.\n    *   $\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ (GFP$^+$) cells will still undergo a maximal, cell-autonomous response.\n\nThe ideal experimental design must include both large- and small-patch mosaics to create these distinct signaling contexts and must use single-cell resolution readouts to distinguish the behavior of the two genotypes.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Implement both small-patch ($d \\ll \\ell$) and large-patch ($d \\gg \\ell$) mosaics with RFP$^+$ $\\mathrm{TR}^{-/-}$ and GFP$^+$ $\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ cells, and measure apoptosis at $t = 24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ as a function of local neighbor composition. Predict that under saturating T3: in all-GFP tails, GFP$^+$ apoptosis is $\\approx 80\\%$; in all-RFP tails, RFP$^+$ apoptosis is near baseline $\\approx 5\\%$; in small-patch mosaics (typical $f \\approx 0.5$ everywhere), RFP$^+$ apoptosis increases to $\\approx 40\\%$ while GFP$^+$ remains $\\approx 80\\%$; in large-patch mosaics, RFP$^+$ cells deeper than $\\ell$ from GFP$^+$ boundaries remain near $\\approx 5\\%$, whereas RFP$^+$ cells within $\\ell$ of GFP$^+$ boundaries show an approximately linear increase with local $f$, reaching $\\approx 40\\%$ at $f \\approx 0.5$. Define a cell-autonomy index $A = 1 - \\dfrac{P_{\\mathrm{RFP}}}{P_{\\mathrm{GFP}}}$ in small-patch mosaics (at $f \\approx 0.5$), yielding $A \\approx 0.5$, consistent with mixed cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous components.**\nThis option presents an exemplary experimental design. It correctly proposes using both large- and small-patch mosaics to probe different signaling regimes. The predicted quantitative outcomes are entirely consistent with the logical deduction from first principles: maximal response in GFP$^+$ cells ($\\approx 80\\%$), baseline in isolated RFP$^+$ cells ($\\approx 5\\%$), and an intermediate, rescued response in RFP$^+$ cells exposed to neighbors ($\\approx 40\\%$). The predicted gradient of apoptosis near the large-patch boundary is also correct. The proposed cell-autonomy index $A$ is a standard way to quantify such phenomena, where $A=1$ means purely cell-autonomous and $A=0$ means purely non-cell-autonomous. The calculated value of $A = 1 - (40/80) = 0.5$ correctly reflects a mixed contribution.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Use only small-patch ($d \\ll \\ell$) mosaics and score global tail-length regression over $t = 48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ without single-cell readouts. Predict that because T3 is present systemically, both GFP$^+$ and RFP$^+$ cells undergo similar apoptosis rates $\\approx 80\\%$, and that the fraction of RFP$^+$ cells has no measurable effect on regression slope.**\nThis option is flawed. Firstly, the experimental design is inadequate. A global readout like tail length cannot distinguish the contributions of different cell types, rendering the GFP$^+$/RFP$^+$ labeling useless. Relying only on small-patch mosaics prevents the isolation of purely cell-autonomous effects, which is possible in the center of large patches. Secondly, the prediction that RFP$^+$ cells will have an apoptosis rate of $\\approx 80\\%$ is incorrect; it assumes a perfect non-cell-autonomous rescue, which ignores the necessity of the cell's own TR for the full response (Principle i).\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Generate large-patch ($d \\gg \\ell$) mosaics but analyze apoptosis only in the RFP$^+$ islands’ interiors ($>$ $\\ell$ from any boundary). Predict that non-cell-autonomous effects dominate, so that RFP$^+$ apoptosis is $\\approx 80\\%$ even when isolated from GFP$^+$ cells by distances $\\gg \\ell$, and conclude that TR in a cell is dispensable for tail resorption.**\nThis option contains a fundamental contradiction. It speaks of non-cell-autonomous effects that \"dominate\" but then predicts their action at a distance $\\gg \\ell$, which violates the given definition of a finite signaling range $\\ell$. This is logically inconsistent. An experiment analyzing only the interior of large RFP$^+$ patches is precisely the condition where non-cell-autonomous effects should be *absent*, and thus RFP$^+$ apoptosis should be at baseline. The prediction and subsequent conclusion are therefore based on flawed reasoning.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Implement small-patch ($d \\ll \\ell$) mosaics and deplete macrophages to eliminate non-cell-autonomous effects, then infer cell autonomy from unchanged RFP$^+$ apoptosis. Predict that under saturating T3 without macrophages, RFP$^+$ apoptosis will still be $\\approx 40\\%$ and GFP$^+$ $\\approx 80\\%$, independent of local $f$, demonstrating partial non-cell-autonomy even when paracrine sources are removed.**\nThis option is poorly conceived. While macrophage depletion is a valid experiment to test the *source* of the non-cell-autonomous signal, this option frames it as the primary method to distinguish autonomy from non-autonomy, which it is not. The prediction that removing a key potential paracrine source (macrophages) has *no effect* on the non-cell-autonomous rescue (RFP$^+$ apoptosis remains at $\\approx 40\\%$) is counterintuitive. Furthermore, the conclusion is nonsensical: it claims to demonstrate non-cell-autonomy by showing the effect persists after removing its proposed source.

For a pair with total half-site score $S = w_1 + w_2$ and spacer length $n$, the effective binding free energy in units of thermal energy $k_B T$ is modeled as\n$$\n\\Delta G = G_0 - \\lambda S + \\delta (n-4)^2,\n$$\nwhere $G_0$ is an offset, $\\lambda$ scales affinity to score, and $\\delta$ penalizes deviations from DR$4$.\n- In a thermodynamic occupancy model with chemical potential $\\mu$, the binding probability for the strongest site in a promoter is\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\Delta G - \\mu\\right)}.\n$$\n- Assuming TR occupancy does not depend on ligand state but the transcriptional output does, the reporter expression without TH (unliganded TR, repressive) is\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{off}} = E_0 (1 - p) + E_{\\mathrm{rep}} p,\n$$\nand with saturating TH (liganded TR, activating) is\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{on}} = E_0 (1 - p) + E_{\\mathrm{act}} p.\n$$\nThe predicted fold change is\n$$\nF = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{on}}}{E_{\\mathrm{off}}}.\n$$\nA reporter is classified as positive if $F \\ge \\Theta$, with threshold $\\Theta$ specified below.\n\nYour program must implement the following steps in a strand-aware manner:\n1. Scan both the forward sequence and its reverse complement.\n2. On each strand, compute the PWM log-odds score $w$ for every $6$-mer window.\n3. For each allowed spacer length $n \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$, compute all direct-repeat pairs comprised of two $6$-mers separated by $n$ bases on the same strand. For each pair, compute $S$, then $\\Delta G$, and select the pair with minimal $\\Delta G$ (i.e., strongest predicted binding) across both strands.\n4. Compute $p$, $E_{\\mathrm{off}}$, $E_{\\mathrm{on}}$, and $F$ for the strongest site.\n5. Classify the promoter as predicted positive if $F \\ge \\Theta$.\n6. Compare the predicted classification to measured reporter fold-change data using the same threshold $\\Theta$ to produce a validation accuracy.\n\nUse the following fixed parameters:\n- Background frequencies: $b(A)=b(C)=b(G)=b(T)=0.25$.\n- PWM probabilities $P_{k,x}$ for the AGGTCA-like half-site (rows are positions $k \\in \\{1,\\ldots,6\\}$; columns are bases in the order $A,C,G,T$):\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0.75 & 0.07 & 0.13 & 0.05 \\\\\n0.03 & 0.04 & 0.90 & 0.03 \\\\\n0.05 & 0.05 & 0.85 & 0.05 \\\\\n0.05 & 0.05 & 0.05 & 0.85 \\\\\n0.03 & 0.90 & 0.04 & 0.03 \\\\\n0.80 & 0.05 & 0.10 & 0.05 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n- Energy and expression parameters: $G_0 = 8.0$, $\\lambda = 1.0$, $\\delta = 8.0$, $\\mu = 0.0$, $E_0 = 1.0$, $E_{\\mathrm{rep}} = 0.5$, $E_{\\mathrm{act}} = 1.8$, $\\Theta = 1.5$.\n- Angle units are not applicable. No physical unit conversion is needed. All reported numerical outputs must be rounded to exactly three decimal places.\n\nTest suite:\nProvide the following promoter sequences (uppercase DNA, forward strand) and measured reporter fold changes (defined as $E_{\\mathrm{on}}/E_{\\mathrm{off}}$ from experiments) to validate predictions. The program must treat sequences as plain strings and must not require any external input.\n\n- Case $1$: Sequence $=$ \"GCTAGCAGGTCATTTTAGGTCACGATCGTACGATCGATCG\", measured fold change $=$ $3.000$.\n- Case $2$: Sequence $=$ \"TTTAGGTCATTTAGGTCAGGCGTACGATC\", measured fold change $=$ $1.300$.\n- Case $3$: Sequence $=$ \"ACACACGTATATGCGTATACGCGTATATGCGTATAC\", measured fold change $=$ $1.000$.\n- Case $4$: Sequence $=$ \"GATCTGACCTAAAATGACCTGAGGCTAGC\", measured fold change $=$ $2.200$.\n- Case $5$: Sequence $=$ \"GGGAGGACATTTTAGGACAGGGTT\", measured fold change $=$ $1.600$.\n\nOutput specification:\n- For each case in order $1$ through $5$, compute the predicted fold change $F$ for the strongest site as defined above and round to three decimal places.\n- Compute the validation accuracy as the fraction of cases for which the predicted classification (using threshold $\\Theta$) matches the measured classification (using the same threshold $\\Theta$), rounded to three decimal places.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with the $6$ entries being the $5$ predicted fold changes followed by the accuracy, for example $[F_1,F_2,F_3,F_4,F_5,{\\mathrm{acc}}]$ where each symbol denotes a decimal number rounded to three decimal places.", "solution": "The problem provided is a valid, well-posed, and scientifically grounded exercise in computational biology. It requires the implementation of a standard bioinformatics pipeline to predict transcription factor binding and its effect on gene expression. All necessary components, including mathematical models, parameters, and test data, are specified unambiguously. The problem is self-contained and free of scientific or logical contradictions. I will therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe core of the solution is to implement a computational procedure that systematically evaluates all potential Thyroid Hormone Receptor (TR) binding sites in a given DNA promoter sequence, identifies the strongest binding site according to a specified energy function, and then predicts the transcriptional fold-change using a thermodynamic model of occupancy and a two-state expression model.\n\nThe overall process for each promoter sequence can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1.  **Preprocessing and Parameterization**:\n    The Position Weight Matrix (PWM) probabilities, $P_{k,x}$, and background nucleotide frequencies, $b(x)$, are used to construct a log-odds scoring matrix. This matrix, which I will denote as $M$, will have entries $M_{k,x} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{k,x}}{b(x_k)}\\right)$. Since the background frequencies are uniform ($b(A)=b(C)=b(G)=b(T)=0.25$), this simplifies to $M_{k,x} = \\ln(P_{k,x}) - \\ln(0.25) = \\ln(P_{k,x}) + \\ln(4)$. Pre-calculating this $6 \\times 4$ matrix allows for efficient scoring of all $6$-base-pair (6-mer) sequences. A mapping from DNA bases ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') to matrix indices ($0, 1, 2, 3$) is also established.\n\n2.  **Strand-Aware Analysis**:\n    The problem mandates a \"strand-aware\" analysis. This means the entire procedure must be performed on both the provided forward strand of the DNA sequence and its reverse complement. The reverse complement is generated by reversing the sequence string and replacing each base with its complementary base (A↔T, C↔G). The final result for a promoter is determined by the strongest binding site found across both of these strands.\n\n3.  **Half-Site Scoring**:\n    For a given strand (either forward or reverse complement), we must identify all potential half-sites. A half-site is any $6$-mer substring of the sequence. For each $6$-mer $x_1x_2\\ldots x_6$ starting at each position $i$ in the sequence, its log-odds score $w_i$ is calculated as $w_i = \\sum_{k=1}^{6} M_{k,x_k}$. These scores are stored for all possible half-sites.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Strongest Binding Site**:\n    A complete TR/RXR binding site (a Thyroid Hormone Response Element, or TRE) is modeled as a direct repeat of two half-sites. We must search for all such pairs. A pair is defined by the starting positions of the two half-sites, $i$ and $j$, on the same strand. For a direct repeat, $j = i + 6 + n$, where $n$ is the length of the spacer sequence. The problem specifies that we test spacer lengths $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n    For each valid pair of half-sites with scores $w_i$ and $w_j$ and spacer length $n$, the total score is $S = w_i + w_j$. The binding free energy, $\\Delta G$, is then calculated using the provided formula:\n    $$\n    \\Delta G = G_0 - \\lambda S + \\delta (n-4)^2\n    $$\n    Here, the term $\\delta(n-4)^2$ penalizes spacer lengths that deviate from the preferred length of $n=4$. The algorithm must find the pair of half-sites (across all possible starting positions $i$ and all allowed spacer lengths $n$) that yields the minimum possible $\\Delta G$. This minimal energy, $\\Delta G_{\\min}$, corresponds to the strongest predicted binding site for that strand.\n\n5.  **Prediction of Transcriptional Fold-Change**:\n    The minimal free energies from the forward strand ($\\Delta G_{\\min, \\text{fwd}}$) and the reverse complement strand ($\\Delta G_{\\min, \\text{rev}}$) are compared, and the overall minimum is taken: $\\Delta G_{\\text{best}} = \\min(\\Delta G_{\\min, \\text{fwd}}, \\Delta G_{\\min, \\text{rev}})$. If no valid direct repeat pairs can be formed on a sequence (e.g., if it is too short), its $\\Delta G_{\\min}$ is taken as infinite.\n    Using $\\Delta G_{\\text{best}}$, the probability of the TR being bound to this strongest site, $p$, is calculated using the thermodynamic occupancy model:\n    $$\n    p = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(\\Delta G_{\\text{best}} - \\mu)}\n    $$\n    With this occupancy probability, the expression levels with and without thyroid hormone (TH) are modeled as:\n    $$\n    E_{\\mathrm{off}} = E_0 (1 - p) + E_{\\mathrm{rep}} p\n    $$\n    $$\n    E_{\\mathrm{on}} = E_0 (1 - p) + E_{\\mathrm{act}} p\n    $$\n    The predicted fold-change, $F$, is the ratio of these expression levels:\n    $$\n    F = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{on}}}{E_{\\mathrm{off}}}\n    $$\n    This value is calculated for each test case and rounded to three decimal places.\n\n6.  **Model Validation**:\n    The final step is to validate the model's predictive power. For each test case, the predicted fold-change $F$ is used to classify the promoter as \"positive\" if $F \\geq \\Theta$ or \"negative\" if $F < \\Theta$. This predicted classification is then compared to a \"measured\" classification, derived by applying the same threshold $\\Theta$ to the experimental fold-change data provided. The validation accuracy is the fraction of test cases where the predicted classification matches the measured classification. This accuracy value is also rounded to three decimal places.\n\nThe entire procedure is encapsulated in a single, self-contained Python program which processes the five provided test cases and outputs the five predicted fold-changes and the final validation accuracy in the specified format.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{[3.592, 1.241, 1.000, 3.592, 2.335, 1.000]}$$", "id": "2685179"}]}
