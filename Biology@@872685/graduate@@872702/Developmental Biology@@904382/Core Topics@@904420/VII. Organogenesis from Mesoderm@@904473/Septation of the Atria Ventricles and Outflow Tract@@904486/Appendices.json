For a Newtonian fluid, the shear stress $\\tau$ at a radial position $r'$ from the centerline is given by $\\tau = -\\mu \\frac{dv}{dr'}$, where $v$ is the axial fluid velocity. For Poiseuille flow, the velocity profile is parabolic:\n$$v(r') = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4 \\mu L} (R^2 - r'^2)$$\nwhere $R$ is the radius of the conduit and $\\Delta P$ is the pressure drop over length $L$. The velocity gradient is:\n$$\\frac{dv}{dr'} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2 \\mu L} r'$$\nThe wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$, is the magnitude of the shear stress at the wall, where $r' = R$:\n$$\\tau_w = \\left| -\\mu \\frac{dv}{dr'} \\right|_{r'=R} = \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\Delta P}{2 \\mu L} R \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta P R}{2L}$$\nThis expression depends on the pressure drop $\\Delta P$, which is not given directly.

It is a key mediator of the anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and quiescent endothelial phenotype. The expression of the Klf2 gene is known to be strongly and positively regulated by high levels of steady, laminar shear stress. As our calculation shows, the shear stress increases by a factor of $\\frac{125}{32}$, which is approximately $3.9$. This represents a substantial increase. Given the established biological principle that Klf2 expression is upregulated by laminar shear stress, and assuming the endothelial cells' response is not saturated, it is expected that Klf2 transcription will increase under these new hemodynamic conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{125}{32}}$$", "id": "2670917"}, {"introduction": "The spiral shape of the aorticopulmonary septum is critical for properly connecting the ventricles to the aorta and pulmonary artery.
