It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in biophysical modeling—the derivation and calculation of a characteristic length scale from a reaction-diffusion equation. All parameters required for the solution are provided. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe spatiotemporal concentration $c(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ of the morphogen GDNF is modeled by a reaction-diffusion equation. According to the problem description, this equation comprises a diffusion term based on Fick's second law and a linear sink term. The governing partial differential equation is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c(\\mathbf{x}, t)}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 c(\\mathbf{x}, t) - k c(\\mathbf{x}, t)\n$$\nHere, $D$ is the effective diffusivity, $\\nabla^2$ is the Laplace operator describing diffusion, and $k$ is the first-order rate constant for the removal process, which acts as a sink.\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state behavior. In the steady state, the concentration field is time-invariant, which implies that the partial derivative with respect to time is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this condition into the governing equation yields the steady-state reaction-diffusion equation:\n$$\n0 = D \\nabla^2 c - k c\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 c = \\frac{k}{D} c\n$$\nThis equation is a form of the Helmholtz equation.

The operator $\\nabla^2$ has the dimensions of $[\\text{length}]^{-2}$. For the equation to be dimensionally consistent, the coefficient on the right-hand side, $\\frac{k}{D}$, must also have dimensions of $[\\text{length}]^{-2}$. The units are:\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{k}{D}\\right] = \\frac{[\\text{time}]^{-1}}{[\\text{length}]^2 [\\text{time}]^{-1}} = \\frac{1}{[\\text{length}]^2}\n$$\nWe define the characteristic length $\\ell$ as the quantity whose inverse square is equal to this coefficient:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\ell^2} \\equiv \\frac{k}{D}\n$$\nSolving for $\\ell$ gives the expression for the characteristic diffusion length:\n$$\n\\ell^2 = \\frac{D}{k}\n$$\n$$\n\\ell = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}}\n$$\nThis length $\\ell$ represents the natural spatial scale over which the steady-state concentration of GDNF decays in the extracellular matrix.

The general form of the Hill equation for activation is:\n$$A(G) = \\frac{G^n}{K_A^n + G^n}$$\nwhere $n$ is the Hill coefficient and $K_A$ is the concentration of ligand that produces half-maximal activation. The problem states that $K_A$ is equal to the baseline GDNF concentration, which we denote as $G_0$. Thus, $K_A = G_0$. Substituting this into the equation for activation gives:\n$$A(G) = \\frac{G^n}{G_0^n + G^n}$$\n\nWe first analyze the baseline (unperturbed) state. Let the baseline mesenchymal cell density be $\\rho_0$. Then the baseline GDNF concentration is $G_0 = k_1 \\rho_0$. The baseline fractional activation, $A_0$, is the activation at $G = G_0$:\n$$A_0 = A(G_0) = \\frac{G_0^n}{G_0^n + G_0^n} = \\frac{G_0^n}{2 G_0^n} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis confirms the self-consistency of the problem statement, as the activation is indeed one-half at the baseline concentration.
