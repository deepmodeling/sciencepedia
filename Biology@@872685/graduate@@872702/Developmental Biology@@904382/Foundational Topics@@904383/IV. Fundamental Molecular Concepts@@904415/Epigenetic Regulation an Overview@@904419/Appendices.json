It consists of three parts: first, the calculation of fractional occupancy for a simple monovalent interaction; second, the derivation of an effective dissociation constant for a more complex bivalent interaction; and third, a qualitative analysis of the consequences of bivalency. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a complete solution. Therefore, it is valid, and we proceed.\n\nPart 1: Fractional Occupancy of the Monovalent Bromodomain\n\nWe begin with the fundamental law of mass action for a reversible bimolecular interaction. Let $P$ represent the free bromodomain (the protein or receptor) and $L$ represent the free H4K16ac site (the ligand). The binding reaction forms a protein-ligand complex, $C$. The equilibrium is written as:\n$$\nP + L \\rightleftharpoons C\n$$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined as the ratio of concentrations at equilibrium:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{[P][L]}{[C]}\n$$\nwhere $[P]$, $[L]$, and $[C]$ are the molar concentrations of the free protein, free ligand, and the complex, respectively. A lower $K_d$ value corresponds to a higher affinity of the protein for the ligand.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of the total protein population that is bound to the ligand. Mathematically, this is:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[C]}{[P]_{\\text{total}}}\n$$\nThe total concentration of the protein, $[P]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the free protein and the bound protein:\n$$\n[P]_{\\text{total}} = [P] + [C]\n$$\nTo derive an expression for $\\theta$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_d$, we first rearrange the definition of $K_d$ to express $[P]$ in terms of $[C]$:\n$$\n[P] = \\frac{K_d [C]}{[L]}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $[P]_{\\text{total}}$ gives:\n$$\n[P]_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{K_d [C]}{[L]} + [C] = [C] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1 \\right) = [C] \\left( \\frac{K_d + [L]}{[L]} \\right)\n$$\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $[P]_{\\text{total}}$ into the definition of $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[C]}{[C] \\left( \\frac{K_d + [L]}{[L]} \\right)} = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}\n$$\nThis is the well-known Langmuir-Hill binding isotherm for a system with a single class of independent binding sites.\n\nThe problem provides the necessary values for numerical evaluation. The dissociation constant is $K_d = 500~\\mathrm{nM}$ and the free ligand concentration is $[L] = 1~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. It is imperative to work with consistent units. We convert both to micromolar ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$):\n$$\nK_d = 500~\\mathrm{nM} = 0.5~\\mu\\mathrm{M}\n$$\n$$\n[L] = 1~\\mu\\mathrm{M}\n$$\nThe problem states that ligand depletion is negligible, which justifies our use of the given free ligand concentration $[L]$ directly in the formula. Substituting these values, we calculate the fractional occupancy:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{1~\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{0.5~\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 1~\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{1}{1.5} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nAs a decimal rounded to four significant figures, this is:\n$$\n\\theta \\approx 0.6667\n$$\n\nPart 2: Effective Dissociation Constant for Bivalent Binding\n\nNext, we analyze the tandem bromodomain construct ($P_2$) binding to a target with two ligand sites ($L_2$). The overall formation of the fully, bivalently bound complex, $C_{\\text{bivalent}}$, is represented by the equilibrium:\n$$\nP_2 + L_2 \\rightleftharpoons C_{\\text{bivalent}}\n$$\nWe are tasked with deriving the effective dissociation constant for this process, $K_{d,\\mathrm{eff}}$, defined as:\n$$\nK_{d,\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{[P_2][L_2]}{[C_{\\text{bivalent}}]}\n$$\nThis overall process is a composite of two microscopic steps: an initial intermolecular binding event to form a singly-bound intermediate ($C_{\\text{mono}}$), followed by an intramolecular binding event to form the bivalently-bound complex ($C_{\\text{bivalent}}$).\n\nStep 1: Formation of the singly-bound complex, $C_{\\text{mono}}$.\n$$\nP_2 + L_2 \\rightleftharpoons C_{\\text{mono}}\n$$\nThe intrinsic dissociation constant for a single domain binding to a single site is given as $K_d = k_{\\text{off}}/k_{\\text{on}}$. In this first step, one of the two identical domains of $P_2$ can bind to the target. Thus, the forward rate is governed by an association rate constant of $2k_{\\text{on}}$ due to the statistical factor of having two available binding domains. The reverse reaction, dissociation of this single linkage, has a rate constant of $k_{\\text{off}}$. The dissociation constant for this first macroscopic step, $K_{d,1}$, is therefore:\n$$\nK_{d,1} = \\frac{[P_2][L_2]}{[C_{\\text{mono}}]} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{2k_{\\text{on}}} = \\frac{K_d}{2}\n$$\n(Note: Some conventions might also include a statistical factor for the two sites on the ligand, but the final result for $K_{d,\\mathrm{eff}}$ is independent of this choice as the factor would cancel).\n\nStep 2: Intramolecular formation of the bivalent complex.\n$$\nC_{\\text{mono}} \\rightleftharpoons C_{\\text{bivalent}}\n$$\nThis is an intramolecular reaction where the second, tethered domain binds to the second site on the same target. The problem states that the tethering results in an effective local concentration, $c_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, of the second ligand site. The forward rate of this intramolecular step is therefore $k_{\\text{on}} c_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The reverse reaction, breaking one of the two established linkages to return to the $C_{\\text{mono}}$ state, can occur in two ways, so its rate constant is $2k_{\\text{off}}$. The equilibrium for this intramolecular step is given by:\n$$\n(k_{\\text{on}} c_{\\mathrm{eff}})[C_{\\text{mono}}] = (2k_{\\text{off}})[C_{\\text{bivalent}}]\n$$\nRearranging gives the ratio of the two complex states:\n$$\n\\frac{[C_{\\text{bivalent}}]}{[C_{\\text{mono}}]} = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}} c_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{2k_{\\text{off}}} = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{2K_d}\n$$\nNow we assemble the final expression. We need to express $[C_{\\text{bivalent}}]$ in terms of $[P_2]$ and $[L_2]$. We have:\n$$\n[C_{\\text{mono}}] = \\frac{[P_2][L_2]}{K_{d,1}} = \\frac{2[P_2][L_2]}{K_d}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $[C_{\\text{bivalent}}]$:\n$$\n[C_{\\text{bivalent}}] = \\left( \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{2K_d} \\right) [C_{\\text{mono}}] = \\left( \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{2K_d} \\right) \\left( \\frac{2[P_2][L_2]}{K_d} \\right) = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{eff}} [P_2][L_2]}{K_d^2}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this into the definition of $K_{d,\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\nK_{d,\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{[P_2][L_2]}{[C_{\\text{bivalent}}]} = \\frac{[P_2][L_2]}{\\frac{c_{\\mathrm{eff}} [P_2][L_2]}{K_d^2}} = \\frac{K_d^2}{c_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the effective dissociation constant for forming the bivalent complex.\n\nPart 3: Qualitative Effect of Bivalency on Occupancy\n\nThe final task is to assess the change in binding behavior when $c_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\gg K_d$. We compare the monovalent dissociation constant, $K_d$, with the effective dissociation constant for the bivalent system, $K_{d,\\mathrm{eff}} = K_d^2 / c_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\nGiven the condition $c_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\gg K_d$, it follows that the ratio $K_d / c_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\ll 1$. We can rewrite the effective dissociation constant as:\n$$\nK_{d,\\mathrm{eff}} = K_d \\left( \\frac{K_d}{c_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\right)\n$$\nSince $K_d / c_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is a small, dimensionless factor, it is clear that $K_{d,\\mathrm{eff}} \\ll K_d$. A much smaller effective dissociation constant signifies a dramatically increased overall binding affinity. This enhancement of binding affinity due to multiple linked interactions is known as avidity or the chelate effect.\n\nThe fractional occupancy $\\theta$ is inversely related to the dissociation constant. For a given ligand concentration, a system with a lower $K_d$ will exhibit a higher fractional occupancy. Therefore, because the tandem bromodomain construct has a much smaller effective $K_d$ than the monovalent domain, its fractional occupancy will be substantially increased at the same concentration of target sites. The binding curve for the bivalent system will be shifted significantly to the left (i.e., to lower ligand concentrations) and will be steeper, indicating a much more switch-like, high-affinity binding response compared to the monovalent case.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6667}$$", "id": "2635036"}, {"introduction": "Moving from single-molecule interactions to genome-wide patterns requires powerful experimental tools. This problem focuses on the critical skill of experimental design, challenging you to compare the foundational technologies used to map protein-DNA interactions: ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN, and CUT&Tag. By reasoning from a set of core biochemical principles, you will learn to evaluate the trade-offs between resolution, sensitivity, and background noise to select the optimal method for a challenging but common research scenario: profiling epigenetic marks in a very small number of cells [@problem_id:2635064].", "problem": "You are designing an experiment to map Histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) domains in a flow-sorted embryonic cell population that yields at most $10^3$ to $10^4$ cells per sample. You can choose among three profiling methods: Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN), and Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&Tag). Use the following foundational principles to reason about expected resolution, background, and cell input requirements: (i) antibody-guided targeting determines biochemical specificity; (ii) crosslinking and bulk chromatin fragmentation introduce random DNA fragments that are not physically tethered to the target and thus increase background; (iii) enzymes tethered in situ to antibody-bound chromatin preferentially act at nearby sites, which reduces diffusion-limited background and improves signal-to-noise; (iv) adding sequencing adapters in situ at the site of tethering reduces losses during library preparation, which is critical at low DNA input; and (v) H3K27me3 forms broad chromatin domains rather than sharp footprints, so apparent resolution is influenced more by signal-to-noise and coverage than by antibody footprint size. Based only on these principles, select the option that best characterizes the typical relative performance of these methods in terms of genomic resolution, required cell numbers, and background noise, and then predict which method is most suitable for mapping H3K27me3 in rare populations.\n\nA. ChIP-seq achieves the highest genomic resolution because bulk sonication produces finely sheared fragments; it typically works robustly with as few as $10^3$ cells and has the lowest background due to formaldehyde crosslinking. CUT&RUN requires $10^6$ cells and has higher background because Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase) digests nucleosomes nonspecifically. CUT&Tag requires $10^5$ cells and has intermediate background.

The techniques (ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN, CUT&Tag), the target histone modification (H3K27me3), and the experimental context (rare cell populations) are all standard and factual. The provided principles (i-v) are accurate, albeit simplified, descriptions of the core biochemical mechanisms that differentiate these methods.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear objective, a critical constraint (cell number), a set of axioms (the principles), and a question that can be answered through logical deduction from those axioms. A unique, meaningful solution can be derived.\n*   **Objective**: The language is technical and devoid of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, objective, and well-posed. It is therefore **valid**. I will proceed with a solution derived from the provided principles.\n\n**Derivation of Method Characteristics**\n\nLet us analyze the performance of each method based strictly on the five principles provided. The experimental constraint is a cell count of $10^3$ to $10^4$ cells.\n\n**1. ChIP-seq:**\n*   **Background**: Principle (ii) explicitly states that the core steps of ChIP-seq, \"crosslinking and bulk chromatin fragmentation,\" serve to \"increase background.\" Therefore, ChIP-seq is characterized by high background noise.\n*   **Cell Input**: A high background implies a low signal-to-noise ratio. To obtain statistically significant signal enrichment over this high background, a large amount of starting material is necessary. Furthermore, principle (iv) highlights a specific mechanism for reducing DNA loss in low-input methods, a mechanism not present in the description of ChIP-seq. This implies that ChIP-seq is inefficient and requires high cell numbers. It is thus poorly suited for the specified sample size of $10^3$ to $10^4$ cells.\n*   **Resolution**: Principle (v) states that for broad marks like H3K27me3, effective resolution is primarily a function of signal-to-noise. Given the high background of ChIP-seq (from principle ii), its signal-to-noise ratio is inherently low, leading to lower effective resolution.\n\n**2. CUT&RUN:**\n*   **Background**: Principle (iii) describes the mechanism of CUT&RUN, where an \"enzyme [is] tethered in situ.\" This process \"reduces diffusion-limited background and improves signal-to-noise.\" Consequently, CUT&RUN has a significantly lower background than ChIP-seq.\n*   **Cell Input**: The improved signal-to-noise ratio (principle iii) means that a robust signal can be detected from less starting material. Therefore, CUT&RUN requires fewer cells than ChIP-seq.\n*   **Resolution**: With a high signal-to-noise ratio (principle iii), CUT&RUN provides higher effective resolution for broad marks compared to ChIP-seq, as per the logic of principle (v).\n\n**3. CUT&Tag:**\n*   **Background**: Like CUT&RUN, CUT&Tag employs an in situ tethered enzyme (principle iii), leading to low background and high signal-to-noise.\n*   **Cell Input**: CUT&Tag possesses a decisive advantage detailed in principle (iv): \"adding sequencing adapters in situ.\" This step \"reduces losses during library preparation\" and is explicitly labeled \"critical at low DNA input.\" This makes CUT&Tag superior to both ChIP-seq and CUT&RUN for experiments with very limited cell numbers, such as the $10^3$ to $10^4$ cells specified in the problem. It is the method most optimized for low-input samples.\n*   **Resolution**: The combination of high signal-to-noise (principle iii) and high library efficiency at low inputs (principle iv), which preserves coverage, results in the highest possible effective resolution under low-cell-count conditions, according to principle (v).\n\n**Conclusion for the Experiment:**\nThe experiment requires profiling a broad mark (H3K27me3) from a rare population of $10^3$ to $10^4$ cells.\n*   ChIP-seq is unsuitable due to its high background and high cell input requirement.\n*   CUT&RUN is a strong candidate, offering low background and reduced cell input.\n*   CUT&Tag is the most suitable method because it is explicitly optimized for minimal cell inputs by reducing library preparation losses (principle iv), making it the most robust choice for the given sample size.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. ChIP-seq achieves the highest genomic resolution because bulk sonication produces finely sheared fragments; it typically works robustly with as few as $10^3$ cells and has the lowest background due to formaldehyde crosslinking. CUT&RUN requires $10^6$ cells and has higher background because Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase) digests nucleosomes nonspecifically. CUT&Tag requires $10^5$ cells and has intermediate background. For rare H3K27me3 samples, choose ChIP-seq.**\nThis option is entirely incorrect. It claims ChIP-seq has the lowest background, directly contradicting principle (ii). It claims CUT&RUN has high background, contradicting principle (iii). It inverts the cell number requirements deduced from the principles. The final recommendation is therefore baseless. **Incorrect.**\n\n**B. ChIP-seq generally provides lower effective resolution for histone marks and requires high input (often $\\geq 10^6$ cells) with substantial background from crosslinking and bulk fragmentation. CUT&RUN tethers MNase in situ, yielding high resolution with low background and works with $\\sim 10^4$ cells. CUT&Tag tethers Transposase Tn5 (Tn5) in situ to insert adapters at target sites, achieving near–base-pair resolution, very low background, and compatibility with $\\leq 10^3$ cells or single cells. For rare H3K27me3 populations, choose CUT&Tag.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with the derivation. It correctly identifies ChIP-seq as high-background, high-input, and lower-resolution (principles ii, v). It correctly characterizes CUT&RUN as low-background, lower-input, and high-resolution (principles iii, v). It correctly identifies CUT&Tag as the optimal method for very low cell numbers due to its in situ tagmentation and adapter ligation process (principles iii, iv), resulting in very low background and highest performance at the specified cell count. The final recommendation to use CUT&Tag is the logical consequence of this analysis. **Correct.**\n\n**C. ChIP-seq and CUT&RUN have comparable low background because both use crosslinking; CUT&Tag has the highest background due to tagmentation off-target activity. CUT&Tag needs the most cells ($\\geq 10^6$), CUT&RUN is intermediate ($\\sim 10^5$), and ChIP-seq is lowest input ($\\sim 10^3$). For rare H3K27me3 samples, choose CUT&RUN.**\nThis option is incorrect. It falsely equates the background of ChIP-seq and CUT&RUN, ignoring principle (ii) vs. (iii). The claim that CUT&Tag has the highest background and requires the most cells is in direct opposition to principles (iii) and (iv). The cell number hierarchy is inverted relative to the logical derivation. **Incorrect.**\n\n**D. CUT&RUN has the lowest background and cell input because in situ tethering restricts cleavage to bound chromatin, but its resolution is intrinsically poor for histone marks compared with ChIP-seq. CUT&Tag has the best resolution but requires $\\geq 10^5$ cells due to library complexity constraints. ChIP-seq is optimal for rare H3K27me3 populations because broad marks are best measured with crosslinking-based approaches.**\nThis option contains multiple falsehoods. It incorrectly claims CUT&RUN has poor resolution, which contradicts the ramification of principle (iii) and (v) that high signal-to-noise yields high effective resolution. It incorrectly states that CUT&Tag requires high cell numbers, contradicting principle (iv). The final assertion that ChIP-seq is optimal for rare populations and broad marks is unsubstantiated and contradicts the conclusion derived from principle (ii). **Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2635064"}, {"introduction": "Raw experimental data reflects both biological signal and technical noise, a challenge when distinguishing chemically similar modifications like 5-methylcytosine ($5\\text{mC}$) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine ($5\\text{hmC}$).

In conventional BS, unmodified cytosine is deaminated to uracil and read as thymine, whereas 5mC and 5hmC resist deamination and are read as cytosine with high probability.

In BS, both $5\\text{mC}$ and $5\\text{hmC}$ are protected from deamination and are read as 'C'. Thus, the fraction of 'C' reads, $f_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{BS}}$, is a weighted sum representing the total amount of these two modifications, plus a small contribution from failed conversion of unmodified cytosine. In an idealized system with perfect efficiencies, $f_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{BS}} \\approx p_{5\\text{mC}} + p_{5\\text{hmC}}$, where $p$ denotes the true fraction of a given base.\n2.  In oxBS, the oxidative pre-treatment converts $5\\text{hmC}$ into a state ($5\\text{fC}$) that is subsequently read as 'T'. $5\\text{mC}$ is largely unaffected by this oxidation and is still read as 'C'. Therefore, the fraction of 'C' reads, $f_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{oxBS}}$, primarily reflects the amount of $5\\text{mC}$, again with minor contributions from system inefficiencies. In an idealized system, $f_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{oxBS}} \\approx p_{5\\text{mC}}$.\n3.  By combining the readouts, one can resolve the individual contributions. The difference, $f_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{BS}} - f_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{oxBS}}$, is approximately proportional to the fraction of $5\\text{hmC}$. A system of two linear equations relating the observables ($f_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{BS}}$, $f_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{oxBS}}$) to the unknowns ($p_{5\\text{mC}}$, $p_{5\\text{hmC}}$) can be constructed using the known reaction efficiencies, allowing for their quantitative estimation.\n\n**Calculation of the Expected Difference**\n\nWe will employ the law of total probability to calculate the expected fraction of \"C\" reads for each assay. Let us define the given parameters symbolically:\n- True fractions: $p_{5\\text{mC}} = 0.35$, $p_{5\\text{hmC}} = 0.25$, $p_{\\text{C}} = 0.40$.\n- BS \"C\"-read probabilities: $c_{5\\text{mC}} = 0.995$, $c_{5\\text{hmC}} = 0.97$, $c_{\\text{C}} = 0.005$.\n- oxBS parameters: oxidation efficiency $e_{\\text{ox}} = 0.98$ for $5\\text{hmC}$, false oxidation rate $e_{\\text{false\\_ox}} = 0.01$ for $5\\text{mC}$.\n- \"C\"-read probability for $5\\text{fC}$: $c_{5\\text{fC}} = 1 - 0.995 = 0.005$.\n\nThe expected fraction of \"C\" reads in the BS library, $f_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{BS}}$, is the sum of the products of the true fraction of each base and its corresponding conditional probability of being read as \"C\":\n$$f_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{BS}} = p_{5\\text{mC}}c_{5\\text{mC}} + p_{5\\text{hmC}}c_{5\\text{hmC}} + p_{\\text{C}}c_{\\text{C}}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{BS}} = (0.35)(0.995) + (0.25)(0.97) + (0.40)(0.005)$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{BS}} = 0.34825 + 0.2425 + 0.002 = 0.59275$$\n\nFor the oxBS library, we must first determine the effective conditional probability of reading a \"C\" for each initial base type after the two-step process (oxidation then bisulfite conversion).\n\nFor an initial $5\\text{mC}$ molecule:\n- It is falsely oxidized to $5\\text{fC}$ with probability $e_{\\text{false\\_ox}} = 0.01$. The \"C\"-read probability for this path is $c_{5\\text{fC}} = 0.005$.\n- It remains as $5\\text{mC}$ with probability $1 - e_{\\text{false\\_ox}} = 0.99$. The \"C\"-read probability for this path is $c_{5\\text{mC}} = 0.995$.\nThe total conditional probability is $P(\\text{\"C\"} | 5\\text{mC}, \\text{oxBS}) = (0.01)(0.005) + (0.99)(0.995) = 0.00005 + 0.98505 = 0.9851$.\n\nFor an initial $5\\text{hmC}$ molecule:\n- It is correctly oxidized to $5\\text{fC}$ with probability $e_{\\text{ox}} = 0.98$. The \"C\"-read probability is $c_{5\\text{fC}} = 0.005$.\n- It escapes oxidation with probability $1 - e_{\\text{ox}} = 0.02$. The \"C\"-read probability is $c_{5\\text{hmC}} = 0.97$.\nThe total conditional probability is $P(\\text{\"C\"} | 5\\text{hmC}, \\text{oxBS}) = (0.98)(0.005) + (0.02)(0.97) = 0.0049 + 0.0194 = 0.0243$.\n\nFor an initial unmodified C molecule, the oxidative step has no effect, so its \"C\"-read probability remains $c_C = 0.005$.\n\nNow, we calculate the expected fraction of \"C\" reads in the oxBS library, $f_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{oxBS}}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{oxBS}} = p_{5\\text{mC}} P(\\text{\"C\"} | 5\\text{mC}, \\text{oxBS}) + p_{5\\text{hmC}} P(\\text{\"C\"} | 5\\text{hmC}, \\text{oxBS}) + p_{\\text{C}} c_{\\text{C}}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{oxBS}} = (0.35)(0.9851) + (0.25)(0.0243) + (0.40)(0.005)$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{oxBS}} = 0.344785 + 0.006075 + 0.002 = 0.35286$$\n\nFinally, we compute the difference $f_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{BS}} - f_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{oxBS}}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{BS}} - f_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{oxBS}} = 0.59275 - 0.35286 = 0.23989$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The value $0.23989$ rounded to four significant figures is $0.2399$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2399}$$", "id": "2635041"}]}
