It presents a simplified but standard biophysical model of mutation accumulation in the male germ line, a cornerstone of understanding the paternal age effect on de novo genetic variation. The parameters provided are within a plausible range for such models. I will now proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of two quantities: the expected total number of mitotic divisions, $N(A)$, and the expected total number of de novo mutations, $M(A)$, in a sperm cell produced at paternal age $A$.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Expected Total Number of Mitotic Divisions, $N(A)$**\n\nThe fundamental principle is that the total number of divisions along a cell lineage is the sum of the divisions in its constituent, non-overlapping temporal or developmental stages. The problem defines three such stages for the ancestral lineage of a sperm cell:\n\n- **Pre-pubertal phase:** This stage consists of a fixed number of mitotic divisions, $n_{\\mathrm{pre}}$, that occur during embryonic and juvenile development to establish the pool of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). The problem specifies this number as $n_{\\mathrm{pre}} = 30$.\n- **Post-pubertal SSC phase:** After puberty, which begins at age $A_{0}$, the SSCs undergo continuous self-renewing mitotic divisions. The problem provides the expected number of these divisions along the direct ancestral lineage of a sperm produced at age $A$ as a linear function of post-pubertal time $(A - A_{0})$. The duration of this period is $(A - A_{0})$ years. The number of divisions per year is given by the conversion of days to years, $\\frac{365}{T}$, where $T$ is the cell cycle time in days. Therefore, the expected number of post-pubertal SSC divisions, denoted $N_{\\mathrm{post\\_ssc}}(A)$, is:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{post\\_ssc}}(A) = (A - A_{0}) \\times \\frac{365}{T}$$\n- **Transit-amplifying phase:** Upon a signal to differentiate, a cell lineage derived from an SSC undergoes a fixed number of amplifying mitotic divisions before entering meiosis. This number is given as $n_{\\mathrm{amp}} = 6$.\n\nThe total expected number of mitotic divisions, $N(A)$, is the sum of the divisions from these three stages. This is based on the additivity of divisions along the lineage path.\n$$N(A) = n_{\\mathrm{pre}} + N_{\\mathrm{post\\_ssc}}(A) + n_{\\mathrm{amp}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{\\mathrm{post\\_ssc}}(A)$, we arrive at the closed-form expression for $N(A)$ for any age $A \\ge A_{0}$:\n$$N(A) = n_{\\mathrm{pre}} + (A - A_{0}) \\frac{365}{T} + n_{\\mathrm{amp}}$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Expected Number of De Novo Mutations, $M(A)$**\n\nThe cornerstone principle here is the linearity of expectation. The problem assumes that mutations arise from errors during deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication accompanying each mitotic division. The expected number of new mutations, $\\mu$, per division is constant. Because the divisions are independent events in terms of mutation accumulation, the total expected number of mutations is the product of the total expected number of divisions and the expected number of mutations per division.\n\nLet $M(A)$ be the expected number of de novo mutations in a haploid genome of a sperm at paternal age $A$.\n$$M(A) = E[\\text{total mutations}]$$\nBy the law of total expectation, this is:\n$$M(A) = E[\\text{number of divisions}] \\times E[\\text{mutations per division}]$$\nIn our notation, this is:\n$$M(A) = N(A) \\times \\mu$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $N(A)$, we get the closed-form expression for $M(A)$:\n$$M(A) = \\mu \\left( n_{\\mathrm{pre}} + (A - A_{0}) \\frac{365}{T} + n_{\\mathrm{amp}} \\right)$$\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe problem provides the following values for numerical evaluation:\n- Paternal age, $A = 40$ years\n- Age of puberty, $A_{0} = 13$ years\n- Pre-pubertal divisions, $n_{\\mathrm{pre}} = 30$\n- Transit-amplifying divisions, $n_{\\mathrm{amp}} = 6$\n- SSC cycle time, $T = 16$ days\n- Mutation rate, $\\mu = 0.12$ mutations per haploid genome per division\n\nFirst, we evaluate $N(A)$ at $A=40$:\n$$N(40) = 30 + (40 - 13) \\frac{365}{16} + 6$$\n$$N(40) = 36 + (27) \\times \\frac{365}{16}$$\n$$N(40) = 36 + \\frac{9855}{16}$$\n$$N(40) = 36 + 615.9375$$\n$$N(40) = 651.9375$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $N(40) \\approx 651.9$.\n\nNext, we evaluate $M(A)$ at $A=40$ using the unrounded value of $N(40)$:\n$$M(40) = \\mu \\times N(40)$$\n$$M(40) = 0.12 \\times 651.9375$$\n$$M(40) = 78.2325$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $M(40) \\approx 78.23$. The units are de novo mutations per haploid genome.\n\nThe final numerical results are an expected total of approximately $651.9$ mitotic divisions and an expected total of approximately $78.23$ de novo mutations.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n651.9 & 78.23\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2639274"}, {"introduction": "In stark contrast to the continuous renewal seen in males, the mammalian female germ line operates with a finite, non-renewable resource: a pool of primordial follicles established before birth.

In the mammalian ovary, the germ line reservoir of primordial follicles is established before birth and is not replenished postnatally, whereas somatic cues modulate both activation of primordial follicles into the growing pool and atresia.

During month $t$, each primordial follicle independently has probability $\\alpha$ to activate (transition out of the primordial pool), and, conditional on not activating, independently has probability $\\beta$ to undergo atresia (exit the primordial pool).

Then compute the expected age at menopause in years, given by $12 + t_{\\min}/12$. Round your final answer to three significant figures. Express the final age in years.", "solution": "The problem presented is a valid exercise in mathematical biology, specifically in the modeling of population dynamics. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of female reproductive biology, namely the non-renewal of the primordial follicle pool and its depletion via activation and atresia. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and conditions provided to derive a unique, meaningful solution. It is stated objectively and is free from the flaws enumerated in the validation criteria. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe primary task is to model the expected number of primordial follicles, $N_t$, over time, measured in months $t$ from menarche. We are given that at the start of any month $t$, the expected number of follicles is $N_t$. During that month, each individual follicle is subject to two mutually exclusive processes that remove it from the primordial pool: activation and atresia.\n\nLet us consider a single primordial follicle present at the start of month $t$. The probability that it activates is given as $\\alpha$. The problem states that, conditional on not activating, the probability of atresia is $\\beta$. A follicle remains in the primordial pool at the end of the month only if it neither activates nor undergoes atresia.\n\nLet $A$ be the event of activation and $B$ be the event of atresia for a single follicle within one month. We are given $P(A) = \\alpha$ and $P(B|A^c) = \\beta$, where $A^c$ is the complement of $A$ (the event of not activating). The probability that the follicle remains in the pool is the probability that neither $A$ nor $B$ occurs. Since the events are mutually exclusive as specified, atresia can only occur if activation does not. The event 'remaining' is thus equivalent to the event 'not activating' and 'not undergoing atresia given no activation'.\n\nThe probability of a follicle surviving the month, let us call it $p_s$, is given by the probability of non-activation multiplied by the probability of non-atresia (conditional on non-activation):\n$$p_s = P(A^c \\cap B^c) = P(B^c|A^c) P(A^c)$$\nFrom the given probabilities, we have $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - \\alpha$.\nThe conditional probability of not undergoing atresia, given no activation, is $P(B^c|A^c) = 1 - P(B|A^c) = 1 - \\beta$.\nTherefore, the probability of a single follicle surviving the month is:\n$$p_s = (1 - \\alpha)(1 - \\beta)$$\nLet $M_t$ be the actual number of primordial follicles at the start of month $t$. $N_t$ is defined as the expectation of this quantity, $N_t = E[M_t]$. Since the follicles are independent, the number of follicles at the start of month $t+1$, $M_{t+1}$, given $M_t$, follows a binomial distribution with $M_t$ trials and success (survival) probability $p_s$. The expected value of $M_{t+1}$ conditional on $M_t$ is $E[M_{t+1}|M_t] = M_t \\cdot p_s$.\n\nUsing the law of total expectation, we can find the recurrence relation for the expected number of follicles, $N_t$:\n$$N_{t+1} = E[M_{t+1}] = E[E[M_{t+1}|M_t]] = E[M_t \\cdot p_s]$$\nSince $p_s$ is a constant, we can write:\n$$N_{t+1} = p_s \\cdot E[M_t] = p_s \\cdot N_t$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_s$, we get the linear recurrence relation:\n$$N_{t+1} = (1 - \\alpha)(1 - \\beta) N_t$$\nThis is a geometric progression. With the initial condition $N_0$ at $t=0$, the solution for $N_t$ is:\n$$N_t = N_0 ((1 - \\alpha)(1 - \\beta))^t$$\nThis equation describes the expected trajectory of the primordial follicle pool as a function of $t$, $N_0$, $\\alpha$, and $\\beta$.\n\nNext, we must determine the age at menopause. Menopause is defined as the first month $t_{\\min}$ for which $N_t \\leq N_{\\min}$, where $N_{\\min} = 1.0 \\times 10^3$. We must find the smallest integer $t$ that satisfies this inequality:\n$$N_0 ((1 - \\alpha)(1 - \\beta))^t \\leq N_{\\min}$$\nDividing by $N_0$ (which is positive) preserves the inequality:\n$$((1 - \\alpha)(1 - \\beta))^t \\leq \\frac{N_{\\min}}{N_0}$$\nTo solve for $t$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides. Since $0 < \\alpha < 1$ and $0 < \\beta < 1$, the base of the exponent, $(1 - \\alpha)(1 - \\beta)$, is between $0$ and $1$. Its logarithm is therefore negative. When we divide the inequality by this negative number, we must reverse the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$t \\ln((1 - \\alpha)(1 - \\beta)) \\leq \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{\\min}}{N_0}\\right)$$\n$$t \\geq \\frac{\\ln(N_{\\min}/N_0)}{\\ln((1 - \\alpha)(1 - \\beta))}$$\nThe smallest integer $t$ that satisfies this condition is the ceiling of the right-hand side expression:\n$$t_{\\min} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\ln(N_{\\min}/N_0)}{\\ln((1 - \\alpha)(1 - \\beta))} \\right\\rceil$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values:\n$N_0 = 4.0 \\times 10^5$\n$N_{\\min} = 1.0 \\times 10^3$\n$\\alpha = 9.0 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.009$\n$\\beta = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.003$\n\nFirst, calculate the arguments of the logarithms:\nThe ratio $\\frac{N_{\\min}}{N_0} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^3}{4.0 \\times 10^5} = \\frac{1}{400}$.\nThe survival factor $(1 - \\alpha)(1 - \\beta) = (1 - 0.009)(1 - 0.003) = (0.991)(0.997) = 0.988027$.\n\nNow, we compute $t_{\\min}$:\n$$t_{\\min} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\ln(1/400)}{\\ln(0.988027)} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{-\\ln(400)}{\\ln(0.988027)} \\right\\rceil$$\nUsing computational values for the logarithms:\n$\\ln(400) \\approx 5.99146$\n$\\ln(0.988027) \\approx -0.0120455$\n$$t_{\\min} \\approx \\left\\lceil \\frac{-5.99146}{-0.0120455} \\right\\rceil = \\lceil 497.443 \\rceil$$\nThe smallest integer value for $t_{\\min}$ is $498$. So, menopause is expected to occur after $498$ months from menarche.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the expected age at menopause. The age at menarche is given as $12$ years, and there are $12$ months per year. The age at menopause is given by the formula $12 + t_{\\min}/12$.\n$$Age_{menopause} = 12 + \\frac{498}{12} = 12 + 41.5 = 53.5$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

In this problem [@problem_id:2639254], you will explore the molecular underpinnings of this fidelity by modeling how the probability of nondisjunction arises from the interplay between the number of genetic crossovers and the function of essential proteins like the cohesin subunit Rec8, which stabilizes the resulting chiasmata.", "problem": "In the germ line of most sexually reproducing eukaryotes, homologous chromosomes must achieve accurate segregation at meiosis I. A widely accepted mechanistic base is that homologs segregate accurately if and only if at least one physically stabilizing chiasma forms between them during prophase I, which requires both a crossover and persistent sister chromatid cohesion distal to that crossover. The meiosis-specific cohesin subunit Rec8 is essential for maintaining distal cohesion in germ cells; somatic cells use the mitotic paralog Rad21 (also called Scc1) and do not undergo chiasma-mediated segregation. Consider a model in which, for a single bivalent in a germ cell:\n- The number of crossovers is a random variable $N$ generated by many double-strand break (DSB; deoxyribonucleic acid double-strand break) intermediates and repair outcomes and can be modeled as $N \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(\\lambda)$ with mean $\\lambda$ crossovers per bivalent.\n- Due to depletion of Rec8, each crossover independently yields a mechanically stabilizing chiasma (i.e., a crossover with sufficient distal cohesion to tether homologs) with probability $p$, where $0 \\leq p \\leq 1$, and fails to do so with probability $1-p$. You may assume that $p$ is a monotone increasing function of Rec8 abundance but treat $p$ as a fixed parameter at a given depletion level.\n- Accurate disjunction at meiosis I occurs if and only if there is at least one stabilizing chiasma on the bivalent; otherwise nondisjunction occurs.\n\nStarting only from these assumptions and the core definitions above (meiotic segregation requires at least one stabilizing chiasma; Rec8 controls distal cohesion and hence chiasma stabilization; crossovers per bivalent follow a Poisson distribution), derive an analytic expression for the probability of nondisjunction at meiosis I for this bivalent as a function of the expected crossover number per bivalent $\\lambda$ and the Rec8-dependent chiasma stabilization probability $p$.

The concepts of crossovers, chiasmata, sister chromatid cohesion, meiosis, and Rec8 are fundamental to developmental biology and genetics. The modeling of crossover number with a Poisson distribution is a standard and well-justified simplification (the Haldane model). The probabilistic dependence of chiasma stabilization on a protein factor (represented by parameter $p$) is a plausible mechanistic assumption. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and clear definitions to derive a unique mathematical solution. It is objective and free of non-formalizable concepts or contradictions. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nProceeding to the solution.\nLet $N$ be the random variable representing the number of crossovers on the bivalent. According to the problem statement, $N$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$. The probability mass function is given by:\n$$P(N=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^{k} \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}, \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$$\nLet $S$ be the random variable for the number of stabilizing chiasmata. Nondisjunction is defined as the event that $S=0$. We are tasked with finding the probability of this event, $P(S=0)$.\n\nThe number of stabilizing chiasmata, $S$, depends on the number of initial crossovers, $N$. We can compute $P(S=0)$ using the law of total probability by conditioning on the number of crossovers $k$:\n$$P(S=0) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} P(S=0 | N=k) P(N=k)$$\nNow we must determine the conditional probability $P(S=0 | N=k)$. This is the probability of having $0$ stabilizing chiasmata given that there were $k$ crossovers. Each of the $k$ crossovers has an independent probability $p$ of becoming a stabilizing chiasma. Consequently, each crossover has a probability of $(1-p)$ of failing to become a stabilizing chiasma. Since the outcomes for each crossover are independent, the probability that all $k$ crossovers fail to stabilize is:\n$$P(S=0 | N=k) = (1-p)^{k}$$\nThis holds for any non-negative integer $k$. For $k=0$, this gives $(1-p)^0 = 1$, which is correct: if there are no crossovers, there can be no stabilizing chiasmata.\n\nNow, we substitute both the conditional probability and the Poisson probability mass function into the summation for the law of total probability:\n$$P(S=0) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (1-p)^{k} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda^{k} \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!} \\right)$$\nWe can rearrange the terms in the summation. The term $\\exp(-\\lambda)$ is constant with respect to the summation index $k$ and can be factored out:\n$$P(S=0) = \\exp(-\\lambda) \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(1-p)^{k} \\lambda^{k}}{k!}$$\nWe can combine the terms raised to the power of $k$:\n$$P(S=0) = \\exp(-\\lambda) \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\lambda(1-p))^{k}}{k!}$$\nThe summation is the Maclaurin series expansion for the exponential function, which is $\\exp(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{k}}{k!}$. In this case, the argument $x$ is equal to $\\lambda(1-p)$. Therefore, the summation evaluates to:\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\lambda(1-p))^{k}}{k!} = \\exp(\\lambda(1-p))$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $P(S=0)$:\n$$P(S=0) = \\exp(-\\lambda) \\exp(\\lambda(1-p))$$\nUsing the property of exponents $\\exp(a)\\exp(b) = \\exp(a+b)$, we combine the terms:\n$$P(S=0) = \\exp(-\\lambda + \\lambda(1-p)) = \\exp(-\\lambda + \\lambda - \\lambda p) = \\exp(-\\lambda p)$$\nThis is the final, closed-form expression for the probability of nondisjunction for the given bivalent, as a function of the mean crossover number $\\lambda$ and the chiasma stabilization probability $p$.
