It is simpler to first calculate the probability of the complementary event: that no bonds form.\nThe probability that a single site is unbound is $1 - p_1$.\nSince the $n$ sites are independent, the probability that all $n$ sites are unbound is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$\nP(\\text{no bonds}) = (1 - p_1)^n\n$$\nThe probability of at least one bond forming, $p_{\\mathrm{adh}}$, is therefore:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{adh}} = 1 - P(\\text{no bonds}) = 1 - (1 - p_1)^n\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $\\mathcal{R} = p_{\\mathrm{adh,con}} / p_{\\mathrm{adh,het}}$ using the following parameters:\n-   $K_{a,\\mathrm{con}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}$\n-   $\\Delta \\Delta G = 1.50 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol}^{-1}$\n-   $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n-   $R = 8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol}^{-1}\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n-   $n = 100$\n-   $c = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless product $K_{a,\\mathrm{con}} c$:\n$$\nK_{a,\\mathrm{con}} c = (1.0 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{M}) = 0.01\n$$\nNow we compute the single-site binding probability for the conspecific case, $p_{1,\\mathrm{con}}$:\n$$\np_{1,\\mathrm{con}} = \\frac{K_{a,\\mathrm{con}} c}{1 + K_{a,\\mathrm{con}} c} = \\frac{0.01}{1 + 0.01} = \\frac{0.01}{1.01}\n$$\nThe probability of adhesion for the conspecific case, $p_{\\mathrm{adh,con}}$, is:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{adh,con}} = 1 - (1 - p_{1,\\mathrm{con}})^n = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{0.01}{1.01}\\right)^{100} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1.01 - 0.01}{1.01}\\right)^{100} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{1.01}\\right)^{100} = 1 - (1.01)^{-100}\n$$\n$$(1.01)^{100} \\approx 2.70481$$\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{adh,con}} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{2.70481} \\approx 1 - 0.36971 = 0.63029\n$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the parameters for the heterospecific case.

This problem asks you to reason qualitatively about the system-level consequences of altering a key molecular parameter: the valency of the egg receptor EBR1.

EBR1 contains multiple tandem bindin-binding repeats, so that a single EBR1 molecule can engage in multivalent binding with multiple bindin molecules at the sperm-egg contact. Consider a perturbation in which partial proteolysis removes half of the bindin-binding repeats from EBR1, reducing its valency from $v$ to $v/2$, while leaving the monovalent bindin-EBR1 dissociation constant $K_D$ for each remaining site unchanged and not altering the areal density of EBR1 molecules on the egg surface or the areal density of bindin on sperm.\n\nAssume the following fundamental bases from receptor-ligand binding and fertilization mechanics:\n- By the law of mass action, for independent identical sites, the equilibrium occupancy probability $p$ of a single EBR1 site by bindin is an increasing function of the local bindin concentration $[B]$ at the contact and $K_D$ that approaches $p \\to 1$ as $[B] \\to \\infty$ and $p \\to 0$ as $[B] \\to 0$.\n- The expected number of simultaneous bonds formed per EBR1 molecule at the contact is $N_b = v\\,p$ in the unproteolyzed state and $N_b' = (v/2)\\,p$ after proteolysis (sites remain independent).\n- Adhesion strength at the contact, $S$, is proportional to the total number of bonds across the engaged EBR1 molecules, so at fixed receptor density and contact area, $S$ scales with the expected number of bonds per receptor and thus with $N_b$.\n- The probability of successful fertilization per sperm-egg encounter, $P$, increases cooperatively with adhesion due to the need to resist detachment and to trigger downstream fusion, and can be modeled as a sigmoidal, increasing function of the effective bond number, for example a Hill-type dependence $P \\propto \\left( N_b/N_0 \\right)^h / \\left( 1 + \\left( N_b/N_0 \\right)^h \\right)$ for some threshold $N_0$ and cooperativity $h \\geq 1$, with $P \\to 1$ as $N_b \\to \\infty$ and $P \\to 0$ as $N_b \\to 0$.\n- The local bindin concentration $[B]$ at the contact zone increases monotonically with bulk sperm concentration $C$, so that varying $C$ generates a dose-response in $p(C)$, $S(C)$, and $P(C)$.\n\nUnder these assumptions, which option best describes how halving EBR1 valency by partial proteolysis is expected to alter the dose-dependence of adhesion strength $S(C)$ and fertilization success $P(C)$ as a function of sperm concentration $C$?\n\nA. Adhesion strength $S(C)$ is reduced approximately in proportion to valency at all $C$: its low-dose slope is reduced by about a factor of $2$ and its high-dose plateau is about $1/2$ of control.

Both adhesion strength and fertilization success are reduced by a constant factor of about $2$ at all $C$, with no appreciable rightward shift in the dose-response.", "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in quantitative modeling of cell adhesion and signaling, grounded in the principles of receptor-ligand binding, multivalency, and cooperative biological responses. All provided assumptions are scientifically sound, and the problem is well-posed.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in two stages: first, determining the effect of reduced valency on adhesion strength, and second, deducing the consequence for fertilization success.\n\n**1. Analysis of Adhesion Strength ($S(C)$)**\n\nThe problem states that adhesion strength, $S$, is proportional to the total number of bonds, which at a fixed receptor density and contact area, scales with the expected number of bonds per EBR1 molecule, $N_b$. The site occupancy probability, $p$, is a function of the local bindin concentration $[B]$, which in turn is a monotonically increasing function of the bulk sperm concentration, $C$. Thus, $p$ can be considered an increasing function of $C$, denoted $p(C)$, where $p(C) \\to 0$ as $C \\to 0$ and $p(C) \\to p_{max} \\leq 1$ as $C \\to \\infty$. Based on the law of mass action, $p_{max}$ is typically $1$. The proteolytic perturbation does not alter $p(C)$ for any given site, as $K_D$ and the function mapping $C$ to $[B]$ are unchanged.\n\nIn the control (unproteolyzed) condition, the EBR1 valency is $v$. The expected number of bonds per receptor is:\n$$ N_b(C) = v \\cdot p(C) $$\nThe adhesion strength is proportional to this quantity:\n$$ S(C) = k \\cdot N_b(C) = k \\cdot v \\cdot p(C) $$\nfor some constant of proportionality $k$.\n\nAfter partial proteolysis, the valency is halved to $v/2$. The new expected number of bonds per receptor is:\n$$ N_b'(C) = \\frac{v}{2} \\cdot p(C) $$\nThe new adhesion strength is:\n$$ S'(C) = k \\cdot N_b'(C) = k \\cdot \\frac{v}{2} \\cdot p(C) $$\n\nBy comparing the two expressions for adhesion strength, we find a direct relationship:\n$$ S'(C) = \\frac{1}{2} [k \\cdot v \\cdot p(C)] = \\frac{1}{2} S(C) $$\nThis means that the adhesion strength is reduced by a factor of $2$ at **all** sperm concentrations, $C$.\n\nLet's examine the implications for the dose-response curve $S(C)$:\n- **Low-concentration regime ($C \\to 0$):** Here, $p(C)$ is small. The initial slope of the $S(C)$ curve is proportional to $v$. Halving the valency to $v/2$ will halve the initial slope.\n- **High-concentration regime ($C \\to \\infty$):** Here, $p(C)$ approaches its saturation value, $p_{max}$. The plateau of the adhesion curve for the control is $S_{max} = k \\cdot v \\cdot p_{max}$. For the perturbed system, the plateau is $S'_{max} = k \\cdot (v/2) \\cdot p_{max} = \\frac{1}{2} S_{max}$. The saturation plateau is also halved.\n\nTherefore, the entire adhesion strength curve $S'(C)$ is a vertically scaled-down version of the control curve $S(C)$ by a factor of $1/2$.\n\n**2. Analysis of Fertilization Success ($P(C)$)**\n\nFertilization success, $P$, is a cooperative, sigmoidal, increasing function of the number of bonds, $N_b$. The provided functional form is of the Hill type:\n$$ P(N_b) \\propto \\frac{(N_b/N_0)^h}{1 + (N_b/N_0)^h} $$\nwhere $N_0$ is a threshold and $h \\geq 1$ is the Hill coefficient representing cooperativity. Let us denote this function by $f(N_b)$.\n- Control: $P(C) = f(N_b(C)) = f(v \\cdot p(C))$\n- Perturbed: $P'(C) = f(N_b'(C)) = f\\left(\\frac{v}{2} \\cdot p(C)\\right) = f(N_b(C)/2)$\n\nSince $f$ is a nonlinear function, $f(x/2)$ is not simply $f(x)/2$. We must analyze the consequences of scaling the input to this sigmoidal function.\n- **Rightward shift:** To achieve a specific level of fertilization success, $P_{target}$ (where $0 < P_{target} < P_{max}$), we need a certain number of bonds, say $N_{b, \\text{target}}$. In the control case, this requires concentration $C$ such that $N_b(C) = N_{b, \\text{target}}$. In the perturbed case, to achieve the same success, we need $N_b'(C') = N_{b, \\text{target}}$. Since $N_b'(C') = N_b(C')/2$, this implies we need $N_b(C')/2 = N_{b, \\text{target}}$, or $N_b(C') = 2 \\cdot N_{b, \\text{target}}$. Because $N_b(C)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $C$, a larger number of bonds requires a higher concentration. Thus, $C' > C$. This phenomenon is a rightward shift of the dose-response curve: a higher concentration is needed to achieve the same effect.\n\n- **Maximal value:** The maximal success is achieved at saturating sperm concentration ($C \\to \\infty$), where $p(C) \\to p_{max}$.\n  - Control maximal success: $P_{max} = f(v \\cdot p_{max})$.\n  - Perturbed maximal success: $P'_{max} = f\\left(\\frac{v}{2} \\cdot p_{max}\\right)$.\n  Since $v \\cdot p_{max} > \\frac{v}{2} \\cdot p_{max}$ and $f$ is an increasing function, it necessarily follows that $P'_{max} < P_{max}$. The maximal fertilization success is reduced.\n  The problem statement includes a nuance: \"unless the original system was far above threshold $N_0$\". This corresponds to the case where the argument of the function $f$ is in the saturation regime of the sigmoid. If both $v \\cdot p_{max}$ and $(v/2) \\cdot p_{max}$ are much larger than the threshold $N_0$, then both $f(v \\cdot p_{max})$ and $f((v/2) \\cdot p_{max})$ will be very close to the absolute maximum of the function (e.g., $1$). In this special case, the absolute reduction $P_{max} - P'_{max}$ will be small. This is a valid qualification.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A:** This option correctly states that adhesion strength $S(C)$ is reduced in proportion to valency, with both the low-dose slope and high-dose plateau being halved. It also correctly states that the fertilization success curve $P(C)$ is right-shifted and its maximal value is reduced, with a qualification for the case where the system is already far into saturation. This aligns perfectly with our derivation. **Correct**.\n\n*   **B:** This option incorrectly claims that adhesion strength is largely unchanged. It fundamentally misunderstands the concept of multivalency, where total adhesion depends on the number of binding sites ($v$), not just the affinity of one site ($K_D$). Consequently, its conclusion about fertilization success is also incorrect. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C:** This option incorrectly claims that the high-concentration plateau for adhesion strength is the same as the control. As derived, the plateau is also halved, because $S_{max} \\propto v$. It also incorrectly claims fertilization success reaches the same maximal value. As shown, $P'_{max} < P_{max}$ in general. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D:** This option correctly states that adhesion strength is reduced by a factor of $2$, but it incorrectly claims the same constant factor reduction for fertilization success. Due to the nonlinear sigmoidal relationship, the reduction factor for $P(C)$ is not constant. It also incorrectly claims there is no rightward shift, which contradicts the fundamental behavior of dose-response curves when their input is scaled down. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis of the provided model, Option A is the only one that accurately describes all the expected effects.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2673747"}]}
