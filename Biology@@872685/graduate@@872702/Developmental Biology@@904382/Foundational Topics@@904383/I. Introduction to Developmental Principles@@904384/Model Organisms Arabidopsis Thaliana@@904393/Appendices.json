It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. We shall proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the fraction of protonated IAA, $f_{HA}$.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the fraction of indole-$3$-acetic acid (IAA) in its protonated, neutral form, denoted $IAAH$, as a function of $pH$ and the acid dissociation constant $pK_a$. We begin from first principles.\n\nThe equilibrium for the dissociation of the monoprotic weak acid $IAAH$ in an aqueous solution is given by:\n$$IAAH \\rightleftharpoons H^{+} + IAA^{-}$$\nThe acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, is defined as the equilibrium constant for this reaction. Assuming activity coefficients are unity, we can write $K_a$ in terms of molar concentrations:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[H^{+}][IAA^{-}]}{[IAAH]}$$\nwhere $[H^{+}]$, $[IAA^{-}]$, and $[IAAH]$ are the molar concentrations of the hydrogen ion, the deprotonated anion, and the protonated acid, respectively.\n\nThe principle of conservation of mass states that the total concentration of IAA, denoted $[IAA]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the concentrations of its protonated and deprotonated forms:\n$$[IAA]_{\\text{total}} = [IAAH] + [IAA^{-}]$$\nThe fraction of IAA in the protonated form, which we denote as $f_{HA}$, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the protonated form to the total concentration:\n$$f_{HA} = \\frac{[IAAH]}{[IAA]_{\\text{total}}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[IAA]_{\\text{total}}$ into the denominator, we get:\n$$f_{HA} = \\frac{[IAAH]}{[IAAH] + [IAA^{-}]}$$\nTo express this fraction in terms of measurable quantities, we must eliminate $[IAA^{-}]$. We rearrange the expression for $K_a$ to solve for $[IAA^{-}]$:\n$$[IAA^{-}] = K_a \\frac{[IAAH]}{[H^{+}]}$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[IAA^{-}]$ back into the equation for $f_{HA}$:\n$$f_{HA} = \\frac{[IAAH]}{[IAAH] + K_a \\frac{[IAAH]}{[H^{+}]}}$$\nThe term $[IAAH]$ is present in the numerator and in both terms of the denominator, so it can be cancelled, provided $[IAAH]$ is non-zero, which is a trivial requirement. This simplification yields:\n$$f_{HA} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{K_a}{[H^{+}]}}$$\nThis expression relates the fraction of the protonated form to the hydrogen ion concentration and the acid dissociation constant. The problem requires the expression in terms of $pH$ and $pK_a$. We use the standard definitions:\n$$pH = -\\log_{10}([H^{+}]) \\implies [H^{+}] = 10^{-pH}$$\n$$pK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a) \\implies K_a = 10^{-pK_a}$$\nSubstituting these into our expression for $f_{HA}$:\n$$f_{HA}(pH, pK_a) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{10^{-pK_a}}{10^{-pH}}}$$\nUsing the property of exponents $\\frac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a-b}$, we simplify the fraction in the denominator:\n$$f_{HA}(pH, pK_a) = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-pK_a - (-pH)}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_a}}$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the fraction of IAA present in the protonated form. This equation is a general form of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation rearranged to solve for the fraction of the acid species.\n\nPart 2: Evaluation of the fraction of protonated IAA in the apoplast and cytosol.\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$pK_a = 4.8$\n$pH_{\\text{apoplast}} = 5.5$\n$pH_{\\text{cytosol}} = 7.2$\n\nWe will use the derived formula $f_{HA} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_a}}$ to calculate the fraction in each compartment.\n\nFor the apoplast:\nThe difference $pH - pK_a$ is $5.5 - 4.8 = 0.7$.\n$$f_{HA, \\text{apoplast}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{0.7}}$$\nCalculating the value: $10^{0.7} \\approx 5.01187$.\n$$f_{HA, \\text{apoplast}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 5.01187} = \\frac{1}{6.01187} \\approx 0.16633$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $f_{HA, \\text{apoplast}} = 0.166$.\n\nFor the cytosol:\nThe difference $pH - pK_a$ is $7.2 - 4.8 = 2.4$.\n$$f_{HA, \\text{cytosol}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{2.4}}$$\nCalculating the value: $10^{2.4} \\approx 251.1886$.\n$$f_{HA, \\text{cytosol}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 251.1886} = \\frac{1}{252.1886} \\approx 0.0039653$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $f_{HA, \\text{cytosol}} = 0.00397$.\n\nThus, approximately $16.6\\%$ of IAA is in the protonated, membrane-permeable form ($IAAH$) in the apoplast, whereas only about $0.397\\%$ is in this form in the cytosol.\n\nPart 3: Mechanistic explanation for the requirement of efflux carriers.\n\nThe acid-trap model explains the accumulation of weak acids in compartments with higher $pH$. Our calculations provide the quantitative basis for this phenomenon in the context of auxin transport.\n\nThe key premise is that only the neutral, protonated form, $IAAH$, can passively diffuse across the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane. The charged anion, $IAA^{-}$, is effectively trapped.\n\nInflux (from apoplast to cytosol):\nThe apoplast is acidic ($pH = 5.5$), which is close to the $pK_a$ of IAA ($4.8$). As calculated, a significant fraction ($16.6\\%$) of the total auxin pool in the apoplast exists as the membrane-permeable $IAAH$. This creates a substantial concentration of $IAAH$ outside the cell, which can then move down its concentration gradient via passive diffusion across the plasma membrane into the cytosol. Once an $IAAH$ molecule enters the near-neutral cytosol ($pH = 7.2$), the drastically different chemical environment causes it to deprotonate rapidly, forming the membrane-impermeant $IAA^{-}$ anion. Our calculation shows that over $99.6\\%$ of IAA is in the $IAA^{-}$ form at this $pH$. This conversion \"traps\" the auxin inside the cell and maintains a steep concentration gradient for $IAAH$ favoring continued influx. Therefore, net influx can proceed efficiently without the need for protein carriers.\n\nEfflux (from cytosol to apoplast):\nThe situation for efflux is precisely the opposite. Inside the cytosol, the concentration of the membrane-permeable $IAAH$ form is exceedingly low (only $0.397\\%$ of the total cytosolic pool). Consequently, the passive diffusion of $IAAH$ out of the cell is negligible and cannot account for the biologically necessary net transport of auxin from one cell to the next (polar transport). To move auxin out of the cell against this extreme chemical partitioning, the cell cannot rely on simple diffusion of $IAAH$. It must actively export the overwhelmingly abundant species, the $IAA^{-}$ anion. This transport requires specialized transmembrane proteins—efflux carriers (such as the PIN-FORMED family of proteins)—that can bind $IAA^{-}$ and facilitate its movement across the membrane into the apoplast. This process is typically active, consuming energy to move the charged anion against both a concentration gradient (if we consider the total auxin pool) and an electrical potential gradient (the inside of the cell is negatively charged relative to the outside).\n\nIn summary, the substantial fraction of permeable $IAAH$ in the acidic apoplast allows for passive influx, while the vanishingly small fraction of permeable $IAAH$ in the neutral cytosol necessitates carrier-mediated active transport for efflux.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.166 & 0.00397 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2653416"}, {"introduction": "A cornerstone of *Arabidopsis* research is the use of transgenic lines, but working with them requires a solid foundation in classical genetics.

Report this minimal integer $n$ as your final answer. No rounding by significant figures is required because $n$ is an integer.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in Mendelian genetics and can be solved using fundamental principles of inheritance and probability theory. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the analysis of a monohybrid self-cross in *Arabidopsis thaliana* involving a dominant selectable marker. Let the allele for resistance be denoted by $A$ and the wild-type allele for sensitivity be denoted by $a$. The resistance phenotype is dominant, meaning genotypes $A/A$ and $A/a$ are resistant, while genotype $a/a$ is sensitive. The experiment involves self-pollinating a primary transformant ($T1$ generation) and analyzing the segregation of the resistance phenotype in its progeny (the $T2$ generation) on a selective medium.\n\nFirst, we must derive the expected segregation ratios for the two possible genotypes of the $T1$ parent.\n\nCase 1: The $T1$ parent is hemizygous ($A/a$).\nA self-cross of an $A/a$ individual is represented as $A/a \\times A/a$. According to Mendel's law of segregation, the parent produces two types of gametes, $A$ and $a$, in equal proportions ($1/2$ each). The genotypes of the $T2$ progeny are determined by the random fusion of these gametes, which can be visualized with a Punnett square:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n & \\boldsymbol{A} \\text{ (1/2)} & \\boldsymbol{a} \\text{ (1/2)} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\boldsymbol{A} \\text{ (1/2)} & A/A \\text{ (1/4)} & A/a \\text{ (1/4)} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{a} \\text{ (1/2)} & A/a \\text{ (1/4)} & a/a \\text{ (1/4)} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe expected genotypic ratio in the $T2$ generation is $1(A/A) : 2(A/a) : 1(a/a)$.\nGiven that allele $A$ is dominant, the corresponding phenotypic ratio can be determined.\n-   Resistant phenotype (survives on selective medium): Genotypes $A/A$ and $A/a$. The total proportion is $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n-   Sensitive phenotype (dies on selective medium): Genotype $a/a$. The proportion is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThus, for a hemizygous $T1$ parent, the expected phenotypic segregation ratio of resistant to sensitive seedlings in the $T2$ generation is $3:1$. When plated on selective medium, we expect $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the seedlings to survive.\n\nCase 2: The $T1$ parent is homozygous ($A/A$).\nA self-cross of an $A/A$ individual is represented as $A/A \\times A/A$. This parent can only produce one type of gamete, $A$. Consequently, all $T2$ progeny will have the genotype $A/A$. Since all progeny are homozygous dominant, all will express the resistant phenotype. The proportion of resistant seedlings is $1$, and the proportion of sensitive seedlings is $0$. The ratio of resistant to sensitive is $1:0$. All seedlings will survive on the selective medium.\n\nNext, we must propose a criterion to distinguish between a hemizygous and a homozygous $T1$ parent. Based on the analysis above, the presence of even a single sensitive ($a/a$) seedling in the $T2$ progeny definitively proves that the $T1$ parent must have carried the $a$ allele, i.e., it was hemizygous ($A/a$). Conversely, if all observed $T2$ seedlings are resistant, it supports the hypothesis that the $T1$ parent was homozygous ($A/A$). However, this observation does not constitute absolute proof, because it is possible by chance to sample only resistant progeny from a hemizygous parent. The criterion is therefore probabilistic: we plate $n$ seeds and if all $n$ survive, we infer the parent was homozygous. The confidence in this inference increases with $n$.\n\nThe final task is to calculate the minimum sample size, $n$, required to be reasonably confident in this inference. We are given the condition to declare the line homozygous if all $n$ seedlings survive. We must find the minimal integer $n$ such that the probability of making a false declaration (i.e., observing all $n$ survivors when the parent was in fact hemizygous) is less than or equal to a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\nLet $P(S)$ be the probability that a single randomly selected $T2$ seedling from a hemizygous ($A/a$) parent survives on the selective medium. As derived in Case 1, $P(S) = \\frac{3}{4}$. The seedlings are assumed to develop independently. The probability that all $n$ plated seedlings survive is the product of their individual probabilities of survival:\n$$ P(\\text{all } n \\text{ survive} | T1 \\text{ is } A/a) = (P(S))^n = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^n $$\nWe need to find the smallest integer $n$ that satisfies the inequality:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^n \\le 0.05 $$\nTo solve for $n$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^n\\right) \\le \\ln(0.05) $$\n$$ n \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) \\le \\ln(0.05) $$\nThe term $\\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)$ is negative because its argument is less than $1$. Therefore, when we divide by $\\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)$, we must reverse the direction of the inequality:\n$$ n \\ge \\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\ln(3/4)} $$\n$$ n \\ge \\frac{\\ln(1/20)}{\\ln(0.75)} $$\n$$ n \\ge \\frac{-\\ln(20)}{-\\ln(4/3)} $$\n$$ n \\ge \\frac{\\ln(20)}{\\ln(4/3)} $$\nNow we evaluate the expression.

This leads to the condition:\n$$\n\\det(J) - \\frac{(f_u D_v + g_v D_u)^2}{4D_u D_v} < 0\n$$\nwhich is equivalent to:\n$$\n\\text{(iv)} \\quad (f_u D_v + g_v D_u)^2 > 4 D_u D_v (f_u g_v - f_v g_u)\n$$\nThe problem specifies the activator-inhibitor sign structure: $f_u>0$, $f_v<0$, $g_u>0$, $g_v<0$. Condition (i) $f_u+g_v < 0$ implies the inhibitor's self-regulation is stronger than the activator's self-enhancement. Condition (iii) $f_u D_v + g_v D_u > 0$ implies $f_u D_v > -g_v D_u = |g_v|D_u$. Since $f_u$ and $|g_v|$ are of similar magnitude for many systems, this generally requires $D_v \\gg D_u$, meaning the inhibitor must diffuse much faster than the activator, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n\nIn summary, the four necessary and sufficient conditions for a Turing instability are:\n1. $f_u + g_v < 0$\n2. $f_u g_v - f_v g_u > 0$\n3. $f_u D_v + g_v D_u > 0$\n4. $(f_u D_v + g_v D_u)^2 > 4 D_u D_v (f_u g_v - f_v g_u)$\n\n2) Derivation of the fastest-growing wavenumber $k_\\ast$:\nThe fastest-growing mode is the one corresponding to the wavenumber $k_\\ast$ that maximizes the growth rate $\\lambda(k^2)$. Close to the instability threshold, the growth rate $\\lambda(k^2)$ is small and can be approximated by $\\lambda \\approx -\\det(M_k)/|\\text{Tr}(M_k)|$. Since $\\text{Tr}(M_k)$ is negative and varies less with $k^2$ than $\\det(M_k)$ (especially if $D_u+D_v$ is not large), maximizing $\\lambda$ is approximately equivalent to minimizing $\\det(M_k)$. The minimum of the quadratic $H(k^2) = \\det(M_k)$ occurs at the wavenumber $k_\\ast$ such that:\n$$\nk_\\ast^2 = \\frac{f_u D_v + g_v D_u}{2 D_u D_v}\n$$\nThus, the wavenumber of the most unstable mode is:\n$$\nk_\\ast = \\sqrt{\\frac{f_u D_v + g_v D_u}{2 D_u D_v}}\n$$\n\n3) Calculation of the characteristic trichome spacing:\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n$f_u = 0.15\\ \\text{h}^{-1}$, $f_v = -0.40\\ \\text{h}^{-1}$, $g_u = 0.60\\ \\text{h}^{-1}$, $g_v = -0.50\\ \\text{h}^{-1}$.\n$D_u = 30\\ \\mu\\text{m}^2\\ \\text{h}^{-1}$, $D_v = 3000\\ \\mu\\text{m}^2\\ \\text{h}^{-1}$.\n\nFirst, we verify the Turing conditions:\n1. $f_u + g_v = 0.15 - 0.50 = -0.35 < 0$. (Condition met)\n2. $\\det(J) = f_u g_v - f_v g_u = (0.15)(-0.50) - (-0.40)(0.60) = -0.075 + 0.24 = 0.165 > 0$. (Condition met)\n3. $f_u D_v + g_v D_u = (0.15)(3000) + (-0.50)(30) = 450 - 15 = 435 > 0$. (Condition met)\n4. $(f_u D_v + g_v D_u)^2 = 435^2 = 189225$.\n   $4 D_u D_v \\det(J) = 4(30)(3000)(0.165) = 360000 \\times 0.165 = 59400$.\n   $189225 > 59400$. (Condition met)\nThe parameters indeed support a Turing instability.\n\nNow we compute the square of the most unstable wavenumber, $k_\\ast^2$:\n$$\nk_\\ast^2 = \\frac{f_u D_v + g_v D_u}{2 D_u D_v} = \\frac{435}{2(30)(3000)} = \\frac{435}{180000}\\ \\mu\\text{m}^{-2}\n$$\nThe characteristic wavelength $\\lambda_\\ast$ is related to $k_\\ast$ by $\\lambda_\\ast = 2\\pi/k_\\ast$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\lambda_\\ast^2 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{k_\\ast}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{k_\\ast^2} = 4\\pi^2 \\left( \\frac{2 D_u D_v}{f_u D_v + g_v D_u} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\n\\lambda_\\ast^2 = 4\\pi^2 \\left( \\frac{180000}{435} \\right) = 4\\pi^2 \\left( \\frac{12000}{29} \\right)\\ \\mu\\text{m}^2\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_\\ast = \\sqrt{4\\pi^2 \\left( \\frac{12000}{29} \\right)} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{12000}{29}}\\ \\mu\\text{m}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n\\lambda_\\ast \\approx 2\\pi \\sqrt{413.7931...} \\approx 2\\pi (20.3424...) \\approx 127.814\\ \\mu\\text{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding to three significant figures. The predicted mean trichome spacing is therefore $128\\ \\mu\\text{m}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{128}$$", "id": "2653480"}]}
