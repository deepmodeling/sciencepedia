The matrix is\n$$\nP \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 1 & 0\\\\\n1 & 2 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nIn the framework of phenotypic integration and modularity, the eigen-decomposition of $P$ is used to quantify how variance is concentrated along a few coordinated directions, as in Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The eigenvalues of $P$ equal the variances along orthogonal axes capturing the major directions of covariation. Consider the following integration index defined on $p$ traits as the relative eigenvalue variance:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\frac{1}{p}\\sum_{i=1}^{p}\\left(\\lambda_{i}-\\bar{\\lambda}\\right)^{2}}{\\bar{\\lambda}^{2}},\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda_{i}$ are the eigenvalues of $P$ and $\\bar{\\lambda} \\,=\\, \\frac{1}{p}\\sum_{i=1}^{p}\\lambda_{i}$.

It employs linear algebra—specifically, the eigen-decomposition of a covariance matrix—which is the standard mathematical basis for Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The use of PCA to analyze phenotypic integration by examining the distribution of variance (eigenvalues) is a common and valid methodology in evolutionary biology and morphometrics. The matrix $P$ is symmetric, a necessary property of a covariance matrix. Its eigenvalues will be calculated and checked for non-negativity, another requirement.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is mathematically well-posed. It provides a specific matrix and a precisely defined formula. The tasks are to compute the eigenvalues of this matrix and then to substitute these values into the given formula. This structure ensures a unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n3.  **Objectivity and Completeness**: The problem is stated in objective, quantitative terms, free from ambiguity or subjective interpretation. All necessary information is provided: the matrix $P$, the number of traits $p$, and the explicit formula for the integration index $V_{\\mathrm{rel}}$.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary components for a rigorous solution. We may proceed.\n\nThe solution is a two-step process. First, we compute the eigenvalues of the matrix $P$. Second, we use these eigenvalues to calculate the integration index $V_{\\mathrm{rel}}$.\n\nStep 1: Computation of Eigenvalues.\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of a matrix $P$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\nFor the given matrix $P$, we have:\n$$\nP - \\lambda I = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 0\\\\ 1 & 2 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\lambda \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2-\\lambda & 1 & 0\\\\ 1 & 2-\\lambda & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe now compute the determinant of this matrix. Using cofactor expansion along the third row:\n$$\n\\det(P - \\lambda I) = (1-\\lambda) \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2-\\lambda & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\det(P - \\lambda I) = (1-\\lambda) \\left[ (2-\\lambda)(2-\\lambda) - (1)(1) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\det(P - \\lambda I) = (1-\\lambda) \\left[ (2-\\lambda)^2 - 1 \\right]\n$$\nExpanding the quadratic term:\n$$\n\\det(P - \\lambda I) = (1-\\lambda) \\left[ \\lambda^2 - 4\\lambda + 4 - 1 \\right] = (1-\\lambda)(\\lambda^2 - 4\\lambda + 3)\n$$\nWe find the roots by setting the characteristic polynomial to zero. The quadratic factor $\\lambda^2 - 4\\lambda + 3$ can be factored as $(\\lambda-1)(\\lambda-3)$.\nSo, the characteristic equation is:\n$$\n(1-\\lambda)(\\lambda-1)(\\lambda-3) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-(\\lambda-1)(\\lambda-1)(\\lambda-3) = 0\n$$\nThe roots of this equation are $\\lambda = 1$ (with algebraic multiplicity of $2$) and $\\lambda = 3$. Therefore, the three eigenvalues of the matrix $P$ are $\\lambda_1 = 3$, $\\lambda_2 = 1$, and $\\lambda_3 = 1$. All eigenvalues are positive, confirming that $P$ is a positive-definite matrix and a valid covariance matrix.\n\nStep 2: Computation of the integration index $V_{\\mathrm{rel}}$.\nThe integration index is given by the formula:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{rel}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{p}\\sum_{i=1}^{p}\\left(\\lambda_{i}-\\bar{\\lambda}\\right)^{2}}{\\bar{\\lambda}^{2}}\n$$\nWe have $p=3$ traits and the eigenvalues are $\\{3, 1, 1\\}$.\nFirst, we compute the mean eigenvalue, $\\bar{\\lambda}$:\n$$\n\\bar{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{3}\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\lambda_{i} = \\frac{1}{3}(3 + 1 + 1) = \\frac{5}{3}\n$$\nAs a check, the mean eigenvalue is also the trace of the matrix divided by its dimension: $\\bar{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\text{Tr}(P)}{p} = \\frac{2+2+1}{3} = \\frac{5}{3}$. This is correct.\n\nNext, we compute the numerator of $V_{\\mathrm{rel}}$, which is the variance of the eigenvalues. We start with the sum of squared deviations from the mean:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{3}(\\lambda_i - \\bar{\\lambda})^2 = (3 - \\frac{5}{3})^2 + (1 - \\frac{5}{3})^2 + (1 - \\frac{5}{3})^2\n$$\n$$\n= \\left(\\frac{9-5}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3-5}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3-5}{3}\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\n= \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{16}{9} + \\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{16+4+4}{9} = \\frac{24}{9} = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\nThe variance of the eigenvalues is $\\frac{1}{p}\\sum(\\lambda_i - \\bar{\\lambda})^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{8}{3} = \\frac{8}{9}\n$$\nNow, we compute the denominator of $V_{\\mathrm{rel}}$, which is the square of the mean eigenvalue:\n$$\n\\bar{\\lambda}^2 = \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{9}\n$$\nFinally, we compute $V_{\\mathrm{rel}}$ by dividing the numerator by the denominator:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{rel}} = \\frac{8/9}{25/9} = \\frac{8}{25}\n$$\nThe value is requested in exact fractional form. The result is $\\frac{8}{25}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{8}{25}}$$", "id": "2736008"}, {"introduction": "While a single index can measure overall integration, researchers often have specific hypotheses about which traits form discrete, semi-independent modules.
