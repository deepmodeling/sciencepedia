In a two-locus system with alleles $A/a$ and $B/b$, epistasis is defined as the deviation from additivity of the fitness effects of individual mutations. Let the wild-type genotype be $ab$ with Malthusian fitness $w_{ab}$. The individual fitness effects of the mutations $a \\rightarrow A$ and $b \\rightarrow B$ in the wild-type background are:\n$$ s_A = w_{Ab} - w_{ab} $$\n$$ s_B = w_{aB} - w_{ab} $$\nUnder a purely additive model where the mutations do not interact, the expected fitness of the double mutant $AB$ would be the sum of the wild-type fitness and the individual effects of each mutation:\n$$ w_{AB, \\text{additive}} = w_{ab} + s_A + s_B $$\nThe epistatic coefficient, $\\epsilon$, quantifies the deviation of the empirically measured fitness of the double mutant, $w_{AB}$, from this additive expectation.\n$$ \\epsilon = w_{AB} - w_{AB, \\text{additive}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $s_A$ and $s_B$:\n$$ \\epsilon = w_{AB} - (w_{ab} + (w_{Ab} - w_{ab}) + (w_{aB} - w_{ab})) $$\nThis expression simplifies to the standard formula for pairwise epistasis:\n$$ \\epsilon = w_{AB} - w_{Ab} - w_{aB} + w_{ab} $$\nNow, we substitute the given Malthusian fitness values into this equation:\n- $w_{ab} = 0.00000$\n- $w_{Ab} = 0.03742$\n- $w_{aB} = 0.02475$\n- $w_{AB} = 0.07564$\n\nThe computation is as follows:\n$$ \\epsilon = 0.07564 - 0.03742 - 0.02475 + 0.00000 $$\n$$ \\epsilon = 0.07564 - (0.03742 + 0.02475) $$\n$$ \\epsilon = 0.07564 - 0.06217 $$\n$$ \\epsilon = 0.01347 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.01347$ already has four significant figures ($1, 3, 4, 7$).\n\nNext, we must interpret the sign of $\\epsilon$. The value is positive ($\\epsilon = 0.01347 > 0$), which indicates positive, or synergistic, epistasis. This means the combined fitness effect of the two mutations is greater than the sum of their individual effects.\n\nUnder the SSWM regime, an evolutionary trajectory is a sequence of single mutational steps, where each new mutation must be beneficial (i.e., increase fitness) to become fixed in the population. We examine the two possible pathways from the initial genotype $ab$ to the final genotype $AB$.\n\nPathway $1$: $ab \\rightarrow Ab \\rightarrow AB$\n- Step $1$: $ab \\rightarrow Ab$. The change in Malthusian fitness is $\\Delta w_1 = w_{Ab} - w_{ab} = 0.03742 - 0.00000 = 0.03742$. Since $\\Delta w_1 > 0$, this step is accessible.\n- Step $2$: $Ab \\rightarrow AB$. The change in Malthusian fitness is $\\Delta w_2 = w_{AB} - w_{Ab} = 0.07564 - 0.03742 = 0.03822$. Since $\\Delta w_2 > 0$, this step is also accessible.\nThus, Pathway $1$ is fully accessible.\n\nPathway $2$: $ab \\rightarrow aB \\rightarrow AB$\n- Step $1$: $ab \\rightarrow aB$. The change in Malthusian fitness is $\\Delta w_1' = w_{aB} - w_{ab} = 0.02475 - 0.00000 = 0.02475$. Since $\\Delta w_1' > 0$, this step is accessible.\n- Step $2$: $aB \\rightarrow AB$. The change in Malthusian fitness is $\\Delta w_2' = w_{AB} - w_{aB} = 0.07564 - 0.02475 = 0.05089$. Since $\\Delta w_2' > 0$, this step is also accessible.\nThus, Pathway $2$ is also fully accessible.\n\nThe positive sign of $\\epsilon$ is consistent with the accessibility of both pathways. Positive epistasis in this context implies that the fitness landscape is smooth towards the double mutant. Specifically, it means there is no reciprocal sign epistasis, which would occur if a mutation were beneficial in one background but deleterious in another, thereby creating a fitness valley and blocking one of the pathways. Our analysis shows that all single mutational steps are beneficial, meaning the fitness landscape has no valleys between $ab$ and $AB$. A positive $\\epsilon$, given that the single mutations are initially beneficial ($s_A > 0$ and $s_B > 0$), ensures that both pathways are traversable under SSWM.\nThe relation $\\epsilon = (w_{AB} - w_{Ab}) - (w_{aB} - w_{ab}) > 0$ directly implies that the fitness effect of the mutation at locus $B$ is greater in the $A$ background than in the $a$ background. Similarly, $\\epsilon = (w_{AB} - w_{aB}) - (w_{Ab} - w_{ab}) > 0$ implies the mutation at locus $A$ is more beneficial in the $B$ background. This synergy ensures the landscape climbs monotonically along both direct paths to the double mutant.\n\nThe final task is to report only the numerical value of $\\epsilon$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.01347}$$", "id": "2711702"}, {"introduction": "While epistasis describes interactions for a single trait, pleiotropy describes how single genes affect multiple traits, creating genetic correlations that can constrain their simultaneous evolution.
