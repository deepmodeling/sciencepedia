It provides a complete set of definitions and a standard model from theoretical evolutionary biology, allowing for a rigorous and unambiguous derivation. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the directional selection gradient, $\\beta$, for a quantitative trait $z$ that affects the carrying capacity, $K(z)$, of a population following logistic growth. The dynamics of a monomorphic population with trait $z$ and density $N$ are given by the logistic equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K(z)}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $r0$ is the intrinsic rate of increase and $K(z) = K_{0}\\exp(bz)$ is the trait-dependent carrying capacity.\n\nThe system consists of a resident population with trait $\\bar{z}$ at its ecological equilibrium density, $N^{\\ast}$. The equilibrium is found by setting $\\frac{dN}{dt}=0$, which yields $N(1 - N/K(\\bar{z}))=0$. The non-trivial equilibrium is $N^{\\ast} = K(\\bar{z})$.\n\nA rare mutant with trait $z_m$ is introduced into this resident-dominated environment. The invasion fitness of the mutant, $s(z_m; \\bar{z})$, is defined as its per capita growth rate when rare. The dynamics of the rare mutant population, with density $N_m$, are described by:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_m}{dt}=rN_m\\left(1-\\frac{N_{total}}{K(z_m)}\\right)\n$$\nSince the mutant is rare, its density $N_m$ is negligible compared to the resident's density $N^{\\ast}$. Thus, the total population density that exerts competitive pressure is $N_{total} \\approx N^{\\ast} = K(\\bar{z})$. Substituting this into the mutant's growth equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_m}{dt} \\approx rN_m\\left(1-\\frac{K(\\bar{z})}{K(z_m)}\\right)\n$$\nThe per capita growth rate of the mutant is $\\frac{1}{N_m}\\frac{dN_m}{dt}$.

A mutant with a higher carrying capacity than the resident ($K(z_m)  K(\\bar{z})$) will have a positive invasion fitness and will tend to increase in frequency.\n\nThe selection gradient, $\\beta$, is defined as the partial derivative of the invasion fitness with respect to the mutant trait, evaluated at the resident trait value ($z_m = \\bar{z}$):\n$$\n\\beta = \\left.\\frac{\\partial s(z_{m};\\bar z)}{\\partial z_{m}}\\right|_{z_{m}=\\bar z}\n$$\nTo calculate this, we first differentiate $s(z_m; \\bar{z})$ with respect to $z_m$.

Let the intrinsic birth rates of the two morphs be $r_A$ and $r_B$, respectively, and let both morphs experience the same background non-predation mortality $d$.

No numerical approximation is required; provide the exact expression.", "solution": "The problem presents a standard scenario of negative frequency-dependent selection, known as apostatic selection, acting on a dimorphic prey population. The task is to determine the internal equilibrium frequency of the two morphs, $A$ and $B$. This requires constructing the per-capita Malthusian growth rates, or fitness functions, for each morph and then finding the frequency at which these fitnesses are equal.\n\nFirst, we define the Malthusian fitness, $W_i$, for a morph $i$ as the difference between its per-capita birth rate and its total per-capita mortality rate. The total mortality is the sum of background non-predation mortality and predation-induced mortality.\n\nThe given components for each morph $i \\in \\{A, B\\}$ are:\n- Intrinsic birth rate: $r_i$\n- Background non-predation mortality rate: $d$\n- Predation-induced mortality rate: $a P \\left[1 + \\gamma f_i(x)\\right]$, where $x$ is the frequency of morph $A$.\n\nFor morph $A$, its frequency is $x$, so we have $f_A(x) = x$. The per-capita predation mortality on morph $A$ is therefore $a P (1 + \\gamma x)$. The fitness of morph $A$, denoted $W_A(x)$, is its birth rate minus its total death rate:\n$$\nW_A(x) = r_A - \\left( d + a P (1 + \\gamma x) \\right)\n$$\nExpanding this expression gives:\n$$\nW_A(x) = r_A - d - a P - a P \\gamma x\n$$\nThis function represents the payoff for strategy $A$. As required, its derivative with respect to its own frequency $x$ is $\\frac{d W_A}{d x} = -a P \\gamma$, which is negative since $a  0$, $P \\ge 0$, and $\\gamma  0$. This confirms that the fitness of morph $A$ decreases as it becomes more common.\n\nFor morph $B$, its frequency is $1-x$, so we have $f_B(x) = 1-x$. The per-capita predation mortality on morph $B$ is $a P (1 + \\gamma (1-x))$. The fitness of morph $B$, denoted $W_B(x)$, is:\n$$\nW_B(x) = r_B - \\left( d + a P (1 + \\gamma (1-x)) \\right)\n$$\nExpanding this expression gives:\n$$\nW_B(x) = r_B - d - a P - a P \\gamma (1-x) = r_B - d - a P - a P \\gamma + a P \\gamma x\n$$\nTo verify the condition that fitness decreases with own frequency, let $y = 1-x$ be the frequency of morph $B$. Then $x = 1-y$, and we can write $W_B$ as a function of $y$:\n$$\nW_B(y) = r_B - d - a P (1 + \\gamma y)\n$$\nThe derivative of $W_B$ with respect to its own frequency $y$ is $\\frac{d W_B}{d y} = -a P \\gamma$, which is also negative. The model is therefore self-consistent.\n\nAn internal, or mixed, evolutionary equilibrium, $x^{\\ast}$, is a frequency within the interval $(0, 1)$ where the Malthusian fitnesses of the two competing morphs are equal. This is the condition for coexistence under the replicator dynamic, where $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$ for $x \\in (0,1)$. Thus, we must solve the equation $W_A(x^{\\ast}) = W_B(x^{\\ast})$.\n\nSetting the expressions for $W_A(x)$ and $W_B(x)$ equal to each other at the equilibrium frequency $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nr_A - d - a P - a P \\gamma x^{\\ast} = r_B - d - a P - a P \\gamma (1-x^{\\ast})\n$$\nThe terms $-d$ and $-aP$ are common to both sides and can be cancelled:\n$$\nr_A - a P \\gamma x^{\\ast} = r_B - a P \\gamma (1-x^{\\ast})\n$$\nDistributing the term $-a P \\gamma$ on the right-hand side:\n$$\nr_A - a P \\gamma x^{\\ast} = r_B - a P \\gamma + a P \\gamma x^{\\ast}\n$$\nNow, we collect all terms involving $x^{\\ast}$ on one side of the equation and all other terms on the other side.\n$$\nr_A - r_B + a P \\gamma = a P \\gamma x^{\\ast} + a P \\gamma x^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\nr_A - r_B + a P \\gamma = 2 a P \\gamma x^{\\ast}\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $x^{\\ast}$ by dividing by $2 a P \\gamma$. This is permissible as $a, P, \\gamma$ are given as positive or non-negative, so their product is non-zero (assuming a non-zero predator density $P$).\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = \\frac{r_A - r_B + a P \\gamma}{2 a P \\gamma}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytical expression for the internal equilibrium frequency. For this equilibrium to be biologically meaningful, it must be stable and lie in the interval $(0, 1)$. The stability is guaranteed by the negative frequency-dependence (i.e., $\\frac{d}{dx}(W_A(x) - W_B(x))  0$). The condition $x^{\\ast} \\in (0,1)$ imposes constraints on the parameter values, specifically $|r_A - r_B|  a P \\gamma$.
