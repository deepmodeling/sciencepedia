Assume a single round of viability selection per generation, deterministic dynamics in a very large population, no mutation, no migration, and that parasite allele frequencies are fixed during this host generation. Each host experiences a parasite encounter independently with probability $\\pi$, and conditional on encountering a parasite of genotype $P \\in \\{V,a\\}$, infection occurs with probability given by an infection matrix. If infection occurs, host reproductive output is multiplicatively reduced by a factor $(1 - s_{P})$ that depends on parasite genotype $P$.
