This advanced practice challenges you to interpret patterns in the site-frequency spectrum (SFS), a summary of genetic variation in a population. You will learn to distinguish the characteristic signature of long-term balancing selection from that of a recent selective sweep, a critical skill for any evolutionary genomicist studying adaptation [@problem_id:2754221].", "problem": "A genomic region of length $300$ kb in a non-model organism controls a discrete polymorphism mediated by a supergene with suppressed recombination between two structural haplotypes. You sample $n=40$ chromosomes from a single panmictic population and have an outgroup to polarize alleles. You compute site-frequency spectrum (SFS)-based summaries in a central window ($200$ kb) spanning the recombination-suppressed supergene and in immediately flanking windows ($100$ kb on each side). The following patterns are observed:\n\n- In the central supergene window, the unfolded SFS shows a strong excess of intermediate-frequency derived variants, with a peak in derived allele frequency near $0.5$. Pairwise nucleotide diversity $\\pi$ is in the top $1\\%$ genome-wide. Tajima’s $D$ is $+2.3$ and Fay and Wu’s $H$ is $+5.4$.\n\n- In the flanking windows, the unfolded SFS shows an excess of rare derived variants and a modest excess of high-frequency derived variants. Pairwise diversity $\\pi$ is reduced relative to the genome-wide median. Tajima’s $D$ is $-2.1$ and Fay and Wu’s $H$ is $-8.7$.\n\nAssume a constant census population size over the recent timescale relevant to selective sweeps, no recent population bottleneck, and that the outgroup reliably polarizes ancestry. You are tasked with deciding whether the central pattern reflects a recent selective sweep of a single allele or long-term balancing selection maintaining alternative supergene haplotypes, using only SFS-based tests and reasoning from first principles.\n\nUse the following fundamental bases in your reasoning: under the standard neutral coalescent with constant population size, the expected unfolded SFS has counts $\\xi_i$ that scale approximately as $\\xi_i \\propto 1/i$ for derived allele count $i$ in a sample of size $n$; Watterson’s estimator $\\theta_W$ depends on the number of segregating sites $S$ as $\\theta_W = S/a_n$ where $a_n = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} 1/i$; Tajima’s $D$ contrasts $\\pi$ with $\\theta_W$; and Fay and Wu’s $H$ contrasts the weight on high-frequency derived variants with $\\pi$. You may also assume that a recent hard sweep generates a star-like genealogy with short external branches, whereas long-term balancing selection maintaining two long-lived haplogroups creates a deep, structured genealogy with a root split that predates the recent coalescent within each haplogroup.\n\nWhich option best describes an SFS-based strategy that distinguishes the two modes of selection in this supergene context and makes the correct inference given the reported numbers?\n\nA. Focus on the unfolded SFS and the joint signs of Tajima’s $D$ and Fay and Wu’s $H$. A recent sweep yields an excess of rare and high-frequency derived variants (negative $D$, strongly negative $H$), whereas long-term balancing selection yields an excess of intermediate-frequency variants and elevated diversity (positive $D$) with near-zero to positive $H$. The observed central $D=+2.3$ and $H=+5.4$, together with an intermediate-frequency peak and elevated $\\pi$, indicate long-term balancing selection maintaining alternative supergene haplotypes; the negative $D$ and $H$ in flanks reflect linked hitchhiking rather than a sweep centered inside the supergene.\n\nB. Use the folded SFS only to avoid polarization error. Under balancing selection the folded SFS is skewed toward rare variants (negative Tajima’s $D$), whereas a recent sweep creates an excess of intermediate-frequency variants (positive Tajima’s $D$). Because the central window has $D=+2.3$, it supports a recent sweep of a single allele within the supergene.\n\nC. Rely exclusively on Fay and Wu’s $H$: any negative $H$ near the supergene indicates a sweep at the supergene. The flanks have $H=-8.7$, so the supergene experienced a recent sweep despite the central $D0$.\n\nD. Because recombination is suppressed, the SFS is uninformative; one must use haplotype homozygosity (for example, $H_{12}$) or extended haplotype homozygosity to distinguish sweeps from balancing selection. The SFS-based approach cannot discriminate between the two in this case.", "solution": "To distinguish between a recent selective sweep and long-term balancing selection, we must analyze the expected signatures of each process in the site-frequency spectrum (SFS) and its summary statistics ($\\pi$, Tajima's $D$, Fay and Wu's $H$).\n\n1.  **Recent Selective Sweep (Hard Sweep)**: This process rapidly fixes a beneficial allele. Linked neutral variation \"hitchhikes\" with the selected allele, creating a distinct genealogical pattern: a \"star-like\" coalescent with one very long branch leading to the recent ancestor of the swept haplotype, and many short external branches. This leads to:\n    *   A U-shaped SFS: A large excess of rare, low-frequency derived variants (new mutations on the short branches) and an excess of high-frequency derived variants (hitchhiking variants).\n    *   A deficit of intermediate-frequency variants.\n    *   **Negative Tajima's $D$**: The excess of rare variants inflates the number of segregating sites ($\\theta_W$) relative to pairwise diversity ($\\pi$).\n    *   **Strongly negative Fay and Wu's $H$**: This statistic is specifically designed to detect the excess of high-frequency derived variants created by hitchhiking.\n    *   A sharp reduction in overall nucleotide diversity ($\\pi$) at the site of the sweep.\n\n2.  **Long-Term Balancing Selection**: This process maintains two or more haplotypes in a population for a very long time. The genealogy shows a deep split between the lineages of the different haplotypes. This results in:\n    *   An SFS with an excess of intermediate-frequency polymorphisms. Mutations that occurred on the long internal branches separating the haplotypes have had time to drift to intermediate frequencies. The peak often corresponds to the equilibrium frequencies of the haplotypes.\n    *   **Positive Tajima's $D$**: The abundance of intermediate-frequency variants inflates pairwise diversity ($\\pi$) relative to the number of segregating sites ($\\theta_W$).\n    *   **Non-negative (zero or positive) Fay and Wu's $H$**: There is no hitchhiking signature; instead, there's a deficit of high-frequency derived variants relative to the large number of intermediate-frequency ones.\n    *   Extremely elevated nucleotide diversity ($\\pi$) due to the ancient divergence time between haplotypes.\n\n**Applying this framework to the data:**\n-   The **central supergene window** shows a peak of intermediate-frequency variants, extremely high $\\pi$, a strongly positive Tajima's $D$ ($+2.3$), and a positive Fay and Wu's $H$ ($+5.4$). These are all classic and unambiguous signatures of long-term balancing selection.\n-   The **flanking windows** show reduced $\\pi$, negative Tajima's $D$ ($-2.1$), and strongly negative Fay and Wu's $H$ ($-8.7$). These are classic signatures of a selective sweep.\n\n**Conclusion:** The evidence from the supergene region itself points unequivocally to long-term balancing selection. The sweep signatures in the flanks are distinct phenomena and do not invalidate the conclusion for the central region. Option A correctly summarizes this logic and arrives at the correct conclusion. The other options are based on incorrect theoretical premises (B, D) or flawed reasoning (C).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2754221"}]}
