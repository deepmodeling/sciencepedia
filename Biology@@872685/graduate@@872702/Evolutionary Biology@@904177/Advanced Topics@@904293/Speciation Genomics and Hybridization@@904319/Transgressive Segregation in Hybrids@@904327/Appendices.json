By analyzing a simple two-locus additive model, you will construct the complete phenotypic distribution for an $F_2$ generation resulting from a cross between two complementary parental lines.

Let the genotypic values at locus 1 be $+a$, $0$, and $-a$ for the homozygote for the favorable allele, the heterozygote, and the homozygote for the unfavorable allele, respectively. Similarly, let the genotypic values at locus 2 be $+b$, $0$, and $-b$ in the same order. Assume $a>0$ and $b>0$, no dominance, no epistasis, and an environmental contribution that is identically zero (deterministic phenotype given genotype).

It adheres to established principles of Mendelian inheritance and additive gene action. The parameters are clearly specified, and the question is unambiguous. The problem is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. Therefore, we proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe quantitative trait is determined by two unlinked, biallelic loci. The model is purely additive, with genotypic contributions of $+a$, $0$, and $-a$ at locus $1$ and $+b$, $0$, and $-b$ at locus $2$, for genotypes $AA/Aa/aa$ and $BB/Bb/bb$ respectively. We are given $a>0$ and $b>0$.\n\nThe two parental lines are $\\mathcal{P}_1$ with genotype $AA/bb$ and $\\mathcal{P}_2$ with genotype $aa/BB$. Their respective phenotypes, $P_1$ and $P_2$, are calculated by summing the contributions from each locus:\n$$P_1 = (+a) + (-b) = a-b$$\n$$P_2 = (-a) + (+b) = b-a$$\n\nThe $F_1$ generation results from the cross $\\mathcal{P}_1 \\times \\mathcal{P}_2$. All $F_1$ individuals will have the dihybrid genotype $Aa/Bb$. Their phenotype, $P_{F1}$, is:\n$$P_{F1} = (0) + (0) = 0$$\n\nThe $F_2$ generation is produced by an $F_1$ intercross: $Aa/Bb \\times Aa/Bb$. Due to Mendelian segregation and independent assortment, the genotypes at each locus in the $F_2$ generation follow classic ratios:\n- At locus 1 ($Aa \\times Aa$): The genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ appear with probabilities $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{2}$, and $\\frac{1}{4}$, giving phenotypic contributions of $+a$, $0$, and $-a$.\n- At locus 2 ($Bb \\times Bb$): The genotypes $BB$, $Bb$, and $bb$ appear with probabilities $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{2}$, and $\\frac{1}{4}$, giving phenotypic contributions of $+b$, $0$, and $-b$.\n\nSince the loci are unlinked, the joint probability of any two-locus genotype is the product of the single-locus genotype probabilities. This allows us to construct the complete phenotypic probability mass function for the $F_2$ generation. The $3 \\times 3 = 9$ possible genotypes, their probabilities, and their resultant phenotypic values ($P_{F2}$) are tabulated below.\n\n| Locus 1 | Locus 2 | Genotype | Probability | Phenotype ($P_{F2}$) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| $AA$ | $BB$ | $AA/BB$ | $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$ | $a+b$ |\n| $AA$ | $Bb$ | $AA/Bb$ | $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2}{16}$ | $a$ |\n| $AA$ | $bb$ | $AA/bb$ | $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$ | $a-b$ |\n| $Aa$ | $BB$ | $Aa/BB$ | $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{16}$ | $b$ |\n| $Aa$ | $Bb$ | $Aa/Bb$ | $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{4}{16}$ | $0$ |\n| $Aa$ | $bb$ | $Aa/bb$ | $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{16}$ | $-b$ |\n| $aa$ | $BB$ | $aa/BB$ | $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$ | $b-a$ |\n| $aa$ | $Bb$ | $aa/Bb$ | $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2}{16}$ | $-a$ |\n| $aa$ | $bb$ | $aa/bb$ | $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$ | $-a-b$ |\n\nThis table constitutes the $F_2$ phenotypic probability mass function, as required by the first part of the problem.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the probability that a randomly sampled $F_2$ individual exhibits a phenotype strictly greater than both parental phenotypes. This is the phenomenon of transgressive segregation. The mathematical condition is $P_{F2} > \\max\\{P_1, P_2\\}$.\nThe maximum parental phenotype is $\\max\\{a-b, b-a\\}$, which is equivalent to the absolute value $|a-b|$. So, we must find the probability $P(P_{F2} > |a-b|)$.\n\nWe will examine which of the nine genotypic classes in the $F_2$ generation satisfy this condition.\n1.  **Phenotype $a+b$ (Genotype $AA/BB$, Prob. $\\frac{1}{16}$)**: We must check if $a+b > |a-b|$. Since $a>0$ and $b>0$, $a+b$ is positive. Squaring both sides of the inequality gives $(a+b)^2 > (a-b)^2$, which expands to $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 > a^2 - 2ab + b^2$. This simplifies to $4ab > 0$, which is always true since $a>0$ and $b>0$. Thus, the genotype $AA/BB$ always produces a transgressive phenotype. Its contribution to the total probability is $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n\n2.  **Phenotype $a$ (Genotype $AA/Bb$, Prob. $\\frac{2}{16}$)**: We must check if $a > |a-b|$. Again, since $a>0$, we can square both sides: $a^2 > (a-b)^2 \\implies a^2 > a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \\implies 2ab > b^2$. Since $b>0$, we can divide by $b$ to obtain $2a > b$. Therefore, this genotypic class contributes to the transgressive probability if and only if $2a > b$. The contribution is $\\frac{2}{16}$ if $2a>b$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\n3.  **Phenotype $b$ (Genotype $Aa/BB$, Prob. $\\frac{2}{16}$)**: We must check if $b > |a-b|$. By symmetry with the previous case (swapping $a$ and $b$), this inequality holds if and only if $2b > a$. The contribution is $\\frac{2}{16}$ if $2b>a$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\n4.  **Other Phenotypes**:\n    - For $a-b$: $a-b > |a-b|$ is impossible, as a value cannot be strictly greater than its absolute value if it is real.\n    - For $b-a$: Similarly, $b-a > |a-b|$ is impossible.\n    - For $0$: $0 > |a-b|$ is impossible since $|a-b| \\ge 0$.\n    - For negative phenotypes ($-a, -b, -a-b$): A negative value cannot be strictly greater than the non-negative value $|a-b|$.\n\nThe total probability of transgression is the sum of the probabilities of the qualifying genotypes. Let $I(\\cdot)$ be the indicator function, which is $1$ if its argument is true and $0$ otherwise. The total probability $P_T$ is:\n$$P_T = P(P_{F2}=a+b) + P(P_{F2}=a) \\cdot I(a > |a-b|) + P(P_{F2}=b) \\cdot I(b > |a-b|)$$\nSubstituting the probabilities and conditions:\n$$P_T = \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{2}{16} \\cdot I(2a > b) + \\frac{2}{16} \\cdot I(2b > a)$$\nWe can express this result as a piecewise function of the ratio $\\frac{a}{b}$.\n\n- **Case 1: $\\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{a}{b}  2$**. This is equivalent to $b  2a$ and $a  2b$. In this case, both indicator functions are $1$.\n$$P_T = \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{2}{16}(1) + \\frac{2}{16}(1) = \\frac{5}{16}$$\n\n- **Case 2: $\\frac{a}{b} \\ge 2$ or $\\frac{a}{b} \\le \\frac{1}{2}$**.\n  - If $\\frac{a}{b} \\ge 2$, then $a \\ge 2b$. The condition $2a>b$ is true ($I=1$), but $2b>a$ is false ($I=0$).\n  $$P_T = \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{2}{16}(1) + \\frac{2}{16}(0) = \\frac{3}{16}$$\n  - If $\\frac{a}{b} \\le \\frac{1}{2}$, then $b \\ge 2a$. The condition $2a>b$ is false ($I=0$), but $2b>a$ is true ($I=1$).\n  $$P_T = \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{2}{16}(0) + \\frac{2}{16}(1) = \\frac{3}{16}$$\nIn both subcases, the probability is $\\frac{3}{16}$. The strict inequalities in our derivation $2a>b$ and $2b>a$ mean that at the boundaries ($a=2b$ or $b=2a$), the respective indicator function is $0$, placing the boundary cases correctly into the $\\frac{3}{16}$ category.\n\nThus, the final probability is a piecewise function dependent on the relative magnitudes of $a$ and $b$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{cases} \\frac{3}{16}  \\text{if } \\frac{a}{b} \\ge 2 \\text{ or } \\frac{a}{b} \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{5}{16}  \\text{if } \\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{a}{b}  2 \\end{cases}\n}\n$$", "id": "2759812"}, {"introduction": "It is crucial to distinguish transgressive segregation from the related concept of heterosis, or hybrid vigor.

Parents may carry complementary favorable alleles.\n- Scenario 2: Dominance without epistasis ($d_i$ can be nonzero). Parents are fixed for opposite alleles at each locus, with $P_2$ being the higher-mean parent.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is based on the foundational principles of quantitative genetics, specifically the Mendelian basis of continuous variation as formulated in the early 20th century. The parameterization of genotypic values, the definitions of the generations ($P_1, P_2, F_1, F_2$), and the assumptions (no linkage, no epistasis) are standard for an introductory treatment of the subject. The concepts of heterosis and transgressive segregation are central and well-defined in evolutionary biology. The two scenarios presented are classical, idealized models designed to isolate the effects of complementary additive gene action versus dominance. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It contains sufficient information for a unique solution to be derived from first principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous derivation of the expected values and an evaluation of the options may proceed.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe genotypic value of an individual, $z$, is the sum of effects across all $L$ loci, as there is no epistasis: $z = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} z_i$, where $z_i$ is the contribution from locus $i$. The expected phenotype is equal to the expected genotypic value, as the environmental mean is $0$.\n\n**Scenario 1: Purely Additive Gene Action ($d_i = 0$), Complementary Alleles**\n\nIn this scenario, the genotypic values at locus $i$ are $aa: -a_i$, $Aa: 0$, $AA: +a_i$. The parents $P_1$ and $P_2$ are inbred lines fixed for alternative alleles. The condition of \"complementary favorable alleles\" implies that one parent does not possess all alleles that increase the trait value. Let the allele increasing the trait value be $A$ (the 'plus' allele) and the one decreasing it be $a$ (the 'minus' allele).\nLet $P_1$ have genotype $A_iA_i$ at a set of loci $S_1$ and $a_ia_i$ at loci in $S_2$, where $\\{S_1, S_2\\}$ is a partition of the $L$ loci. Then $P_2$ has genotype $a_ia_i$ at loci in $S_1$ and $A_iA_i$ at loci in $S_2$. For complementarity, both $S_1$ and $S_2$ must be non-empty.\n\n- **Parental and Midparent Values:**\nThe genotypic values of the parents are:\n$$z_{P_1} = \\sum_{i \\in S_1} (+a_i) + \\sum_{i \\in S_2} (-a_i) = \\sum_{i \\in S_1} a_i - \\sum_{i \\in S_2} a_i$$\n$$z_{P_2} = \\sum_{i \\in S_1} (-a_i) + \\sum_{i \\in S_2} (+a_i) = -\\sum_{i \\in S_1} a_i + \\sum_{i \\in S_2} a_i$$\nThe sum of the parental values is $z_{P_1} + z_{P_2} = 0$.\nThe midparent mean is $MP = (z_{P_1} + z_{P_2})/2 = 0$.\n\n- **$F_1$ Generation:**\nThe cross $P_1 \\times P_2$ yields $F_1$ offspring that are heterozygous ($A_ia_i$) at all $L$ loci.\nThe genotypic value for an $F_1$ individual is $z_{F_1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} d_i$.\nGiven $d_i = 0$ for all $i$ in this scenario, $z_{F_1} = 0$.\nSince all $F_1$ individuals are genetically identical, the expected value is $E[z_{F_1}] = 0$.\nThus, $E[z_{F_1}] = MP$. The $F_1$ mean shows no heterosis and lies exactly at the midparent value. Since $z_{P_1} = -z_{P_2}$, $z_{F_1}=0$ is between the parental values (unless both are $0$), not outside them.\n\n- **$F_2$ Generation:**\nThe $F_2$ is formed by random mating among $F_1$ individuals. At each locus $i$, Mendelian segregation produces genotypes $a_ia_i$, $A_ia_i$, and $A_iA_i$ in frequencies $1/4$, $1/2$, and $1/4$, respectively.\nThe expected value at locus $i$ is $E[z_i] = \\frac{1}{4}(-a_i) + \\frac{1}{2}(d_i) + \\frac{1}{4}(+a_i)$.\nWith $d_i = 0$, this becomes $E[z_i] = \\frac{1}{4}(-a_i) + \\frac{1}{4}(a_i) = 0$.\nThe total expected value for the $F_2$ generation is the sum of expectations across loci:\n$E[z_{F_2}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} E[z_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} 0 = 0$.\nThus, $E[z_{F_2}] = MP$. The mean of the $F_2$ generation is also at the midparent value.\n\n- **Transgressive Segregation:**\nAlthough the $F_2$ mean is $0$, segregation and recombination can produce genotypes with combinations of alleles not present in the parents. For example, an $F_2$ individual could be homozygous for the 'plus' allele ($A_iA_i$) at all $L$ loci. Its genotypic value would be $z_{max} = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} a_i$. Another individual could be homozygous for the 'minus' allele ($a_ia_i$) at all loci, with value $z_{min} = -\\sum_{i=1}^{L} a_i$.\nSince the parents have complementary alleles (sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ are non-empty), $z_{P_2} = \\sum_{i \\in S_2} a_i - \\sum_{i \\in S_1} a_i  \\sum_{i=1}^L a_i = z_{max}$. Similarly, $z_{P_1} > z_{min}$.\nTherefore, the $F_2$ generation can produce individuals with phenotypes exceeding the parental range. This phenomenon is transgressive segregation. It arises from the recombination of favorable alleles that were dispersed between the two parental lines.\n\n**Scenario 2: Dominance ($d_i \\neq 0$), Directional Allele Distribution**\n\nIn this scenario, $P_2$ is the higher-mean parent, and parents are fixed for opposite alleles at each locus. This implies $P_2$ has all the 'plus' alleles and $P_1$ has all the 'minus' alleles.\n$P_1$ genotype: $a_1a_1 a_2a_2 ... a_La_L$.\n$P_2$ genotype: $A_1A_1 A_2A_2 ... A_LA_L$.\n\n- **Parental and Midparent Values:**\nThe genotypic values are:\n$$z_{P_1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} (-a_i) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{L} a_i$$\n$$z_{P_2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} (+a_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} a_i$$\nThe midparent mean is $MP = (z_{P_1} + z_{P_2})/2 = (-\\sum a_i + \\sum a_i)/2 = 0$.\n\n- **$F_1$ Generation:**\nAll $F_1$ individuals are heterozygous $A_ia_i$ at all $L$ loci.\nThe genotypic value of an $F_1$ individual is $z_{F_1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} d_i$.\nThe expected value is $E[z_{F_1}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} d_i$.\nMidparent heterosis is $E[z_{F_1}] - MP = \\sum d_i$. If there is a net directional dominance (i.e., $\\sum d_i \\neq 0$), the $F_1$ mean will deviate from the midparent value. This is heterosis due to dominance.\nThe $F_1$ can exceed the best parent ($P_2$) if $E[z_{F_1}] > z_{P_2}$, which requires $\\sum d_i > \\sum a_i$. This is known as overdominance at the whole-organism level.\n\n- **$F_2$ Generation:**\nThe expected value at locus $i$ is $E[z_i] = \\frac{1}{4}(-a_i) + \\frac{1}{2}(d_i) + \\frac{1}{4}(+a_i) = \\frac{1}{2}d_i$.\nThe total expected value for the $F_2$ is $E[z_{F_2}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} E[z_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\frac{1}{2}d_i = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{L} d_i$.\nComparing the deviation from the midparent mean:\n$E[z_{F_1}] - MP = \\sum d_i$\n$E[z_{F_2}] - MP = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum d_i$\nThis shows that $E[z_{F_2}] - MP = \\frac{1}{2}(E[z_{F_1}] - MP)$. The heterosis observed in the $F_1$ mean is halved in the $F_2$ mean, as the frequency of heterozygotes drops from $1$ to $1/2$ at each locus.\n\n- **Transgressive Segregation:**\nIn this scenario, the best parent $P_2$ already has the optimal homozygous genotype ($A_iA_i$ at all loci) in terms of additive effects. The highest possible additive value for an $F_2$ individual is $z_{P_2} = \\sum a_i$. Therefore, transgressive segregation due to recombination of complementary additive alleles cannot occur. Exceeding the parental range in $F_2$ would only be possible if there is strong overdominance at individual loci (i.e., $d_i > a_i$), which is a different mechanism.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Declare heterosis due to dominance when $E[z_{F_1}] - MP \\neq 0$ while $E[z_{F_2}] - MP \\approx \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(E[z_{F_1}] - MP\\right)$, with only $F_1$ able to exceed the best parent in expectation (requiring sufficiently large net dominance). Declare transgressive segregation due to complementary additive alleles when $E[z_{F_1}] = MP$ and $E[z_{F_2}] = MP$, with $F_1$ not exceeding parental bounds and $F_2$ capable of producing individuals beyond both parents via segregation and recombination, even though the mean does not exceed the parents.**\n- The description of heterosis perfectly matches the derivation for Scenario 2.

The mean values for $F_1$ and $F_2$ are correct, the intermediate nature of $F_1$ is correct, and the production of extreme phenotypes in $F_2$ despite an unchanged mean is the correct definition.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Declare heterosis when both $E[z_{F_1}]$ and $E[z_{F_2}]$ exceed the best parent by the same amount, and declare transgressive segregation when $E[z_{F_2}]$ exceeds the best parent while $E[z_{F_1}] = MP$.**\n- The first part is incorrect. $E[z_{F_2}]$ shows half the heterosis of $E[z_{F_1}]$, they are not the same.\n- The second part is incorrect. In the model for transgressive segregation, $E[z_{F_2}] = MP$, which does not exceed the best parent. It is the individuals, not the mean, that transgress.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Declare heterosis when $E[z_{F_1}] = MP$ but the $F_1$ distribution has tails beyond both parents because heterozygosity increases variance, and declare transgressive segregation when $E[z_{F_2}]$ regresses to $MP$ from a high $F_1$.**\n- The first part is incorrect.

The narrow-sense heritability is $h^{2} = 0.4$ in both $\\mathrm{F2}$ and $\\mathrm{F3}$.\n\nTruncation selection is imposed in $\\mathrm{F2}$ by retaining only transgressive individuals with $z \\geq T$ to serve as parents of $\\mathrm{F3}$. Using the Lande equation for the response to selection in one dimension, which in this setting is equivalent to the univariate breeder’s equation (response equals additive genetic variance times the selection gradient), compute the expected shift in the mean from $\\mathrm{F2}$ to $\\mathrm{F3}$ and then derive the expected change in the probability of further transgression in $\\mathrm{F3}$ relative to $\\mathrm{F2}$, where “further transgression” means $z \\geq T$ with the same threshold $T$. Assume the phenotypic variance remains $\\sigma^{2}$ from $\\mathrm{F2}$ to $\\mathrm{F3}$.\n\nLet $p_{\\mathrm{F2}}$ be the probability that a randomly chosen $\\mathrm{F2}$ individual is transgressive, and let $p_{\\mathrm{F3}}$ be the corresponding probability in $\\mathrm{F3}$. Your task is to derive and numerically evaluate the change $\\Delta p \\equiv p_{\\mathrm{F3}} - p_{\\mathrm{F2}}$ under these assumptions. Report the single numerical value of $\\Delta p$ as a decimal fraction, rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the change in the probability of observing a transgressive phenotype, $\\Delta p = p_{\\mathrm{F3}} - p_{\\mathrm{F2}}$, after one generation of truncation selection. The analysis will proceed by applying the principles of quantitative genetics, specifically the breeder's equation for the response to selection.\n\nFirst, we establish the state of the base population, the $\\mathrm{F2}$ generation. The phenotypic trait value, $z$, is given to be normally distributed with mean $\\mu_{\\mathrm{F2}} = 100$ and phenotypic standard deviation $\\sigma_{p} = 10$. The phenotypic variance is therefore $\\sigma_{p}^2 = 10^2 = 100$. The narrow-sense heritability is given as $h^2 = 0.4$.\n\nThe probability of an individual being transgressive in the $\\mathrm{F2}$ generation, $p_{\\mathrm{F2}}$, is the probability that its trait value $z$ is greater than or equal to the threshold $T = 120$. To compute this, we standardize the trait value. Let $Z$ be a standard normal random variable, $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$.\n$$p_{\\mathrm{F2}} = P(z \\geq T) = P\\left(\\frac{z - \\mu_{\\mathrm{F2}}}{\\sigma_p} \\geq \\frac{T - \\mu_{\\mathrm{F2}}}{\\sigma_p}\\right) = P(Z \\geq T')$$\nwhere $T'$ is the standardized selection threshold:\n$$T' = \\frac{T - \\mu_{\\mathrm{F2}}}{\\sigma_p} = \\frac{120 - 100}{10} = 2$$\nThus, $p_{\\mathrm{F2}}$ is the upper tail probability of a standard normal distribution beyond $Z=2$. Let $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.\n$$p_{\\mathrm{F2}} = 1 - \\Phi(2)$$\n\nNext, we calculate the response to selection, $R$. Truncation selection is applied by selecting only individuals with $z \\geq T$ to be parents. The breeder's equation states that the response to selection is the product of the narrow-sense heritability and the selection differential, $S$:\n$$R = h^2 S$$\nThe selection differential, $S$, is the difference between the mean phenotype of the selected parents, $\\mu_s$, and the mean phenotype of the entire population before selection, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{F2}}$.\n$$S = \\mu_s - \\mu_{\\mathrm{F2}} = E[z | z \\geq T] - \\mu_{\\mathrm{F2}}$$\nThe expected value of a truncated normal variable is well-known. For a standard normal variable $Z$ truncated at $T'$, the mean is $E[Z | Z \\geq T'] = \\frac{\\phi(T')}{1 - \\Phi(T')}$, where $\\phi(\\cdot)$ is the standard normal probability density function (PDF). Scaling this back to the original distribution gives:\n$$E[z | z \\geq T] = \\mu_{\\mathrm{F2}} + \\sigma_p \\frac{\\phi(T')}{1 - \\Phi(T')}$$\nTherefore, the selection differential is:\n$$S = \\sigma_p \\frac{\\phi(T')}{1 - \\Phi(T')} = \\sigma_p \\frac{\\phi(2)}{p_{\\mathrm{F2}}}$$\nThe response to selection is then:\n$$R = h^2 \\sigma_p \\frac{\\phi(2)}{1 - \\Phi(2)}$$\nThe mean of the $\\mathrm{F3}$ generation, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{F3}}$, is the mean of the $\\mathrm{F2}$ generation plus the response to selection:\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{F3}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{F2}} + R = \\mu_{\\mathrm{F2}} + h^2 \\sigma_p \\frac{\\phi(2)}{1 - \\Phi(2)}$$\n\nThe problem states to assume the phenotypic variance remains constant, so in the $\\mathrm{F3}$ generation, the trait is distributed as $z \\sim N(\\mu_{\\mathrm{F3}}, \\sigma_p^2)$. The probability of transgression in $\\mathrm{F3}$, $p_{\\mathrm{F3}}$, is the probability that an $\\mathrm{F3}$ individual has a trait value $z \\geq T$. We standardize again, this time with respect to the $\\mathrm{F3}$ mean:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{F3}} = P(z \\geq T) = P\\left(\\frac{z - \\mu_{\\mathrm{F3}}}{\\sigma_p} \\geq \\frac{T - \\mu_{\\mathrm{F3}}}{\\sigma_p}\\right) = P(Z \\geq T'')$$\nwhere $T''$ is the new standardized threshold for the $\\mathrm{F3}$ generation:\n$$T'' = \\frac{T - \\mu_{\\mathrm{F3}}}{\\sigma_p} = \\frac{T - (\\mu_{\\mathrm{F2}} + R)}{\\sigma_p} = \\frac{T - \\mu_{\\mathrm{F2}}}{\\sigma_p} - \\frac{R}{\\sigma_p} = T' - \\frac{R}{\\sigma_p}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $R$:\n$$T'' = T' - \\frac{h^2 \\sigma_p}{\\sigma_p} \\frac{\\phi(T')}{1 - \\Phi(T')} = T' - h^2 \\frac{\\phi(T')}{1 - \\Phi(T')}$$\nThe probability $p_{\\mathrm{F3}}$ is thus:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{F3}} = 1 - \\Phi(T'')$$\nThe change in probability is $\\Delta p = p_{\\mathrm{F3}} - p_{\\mathrm{F2}}$:\n$$\\Delta p = [1 - \\Phi(T'')] - [1 - \\Phi(T')] = \\Phi(T') - \\Phi(T'')$$\nNow we substitute the numerical values for calculation. We have $T' = 2$ and $h^2 = 0.4$.\nStandard normal values required are $\\Phi(2)$ and $\\phi(2)$.\n$\\Phi(2) \\approx 0.97725$\n$\\phi(2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2^2}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp(-2) \\approx 0.05399$\n\nFirst, we find $p_{\\mathrm{F2}}$:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{F2}} = 1 - \\Phi(2) \\approx 1 - 0.97725 = 0.02275$$\nNext, we calculate the argument for the second CDF, $T''$:\n$$T'' = 2 - (0.4) \\frac{\\phi(2)}{1 - \\Phi(2)} \\approx 2 - (0.4) \\frac{0.05399}{0.02275} \\approx 2 - (0.4)(2.3732) \\approx 2 - 0.94928 \\approx 1.05072$$\nThen we find $p_{\\mathrm{F3}}$:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{F3}} = 1 - \\Phi(T'') \\approx 1 - \\Phi(1.05072)$$\nFrom standard normal tables or a calculator, $\\Phi(1.05072) \\approx 0.85331$.\n$$p_{\\mathrm{F3}} \\approx 1 - 0.85331 = 0.14669$$\nFinally, we compute the change $\\Delta p$:\n$$\\Delta p = p_{\\mathrm{F3}} - p_{\\mathrm{F2}} \\approx 0.14669 - 0.02275 = 0.12394$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.1239$. This represents a substantial increase in the frequency of transgressive individuals due to one generation of strong directional selection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1239}$$", "id": "2759745"}]}
