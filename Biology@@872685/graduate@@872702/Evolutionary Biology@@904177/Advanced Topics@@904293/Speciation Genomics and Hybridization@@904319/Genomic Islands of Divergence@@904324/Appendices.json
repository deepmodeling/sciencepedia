Consider two populations sampled at a nonrecombining genomic window under the infinite-sites mutation model with low per-site mutation rate and no sequencing error. Let $d_{XY}$ denote the mean number of nucleotide differences per site between one sequence drawn at random from population $X$ and one sequence drawn at random from population $Y$ (absolute divergence). Let $\\pi_{i}$ denote the mean number of nucleotide differences per site between two sequences drawn at random from population $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$ (within-population nucleotide diversity), and let $\\bar{\\pi}$ be the across-population average of within-population diversity defined by $\\bar{\\pi} = (\\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2})/2$. Define the net molecular divergence as $D_{a} = d_{XY} - \\bar{\\pi}$, which removes the contribution of segregating variation shared across the populations, and define the Fixation Index (F_ST) at this window as the fraction of the total per-site between-population divergence attributable to net divergence, that is, the ratio of the between-population component to the total.\n \nStarting from these definitions and without invoking any additional summary-statistic formulas, derive an expression for $F_{ST}$ in terms of $d_{XY}$ and $\\bar{\\pi}$.

The definitions of nucleotide diversity ($\\pi$), absolute divergence ($d_{XY}$), net divergence ($D_a$), and the Fixation Index ($F_{ST}$) are standard in the field of population genetics. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part answer: first, a derivation of the formula for $F_{ST}$; second, a numerical calculation of $F_{ST}$ for the given data; and third, a brief interpretation of the result.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for $F_{ST}$. The problem defines $F_{ST}$ as \"the ratio of the between-population component to the total\". It further specifies that the \"between-population component\" is the net molecular divergence, $D_a$, and that the \"total\" component is the total per-site between-population divergence. This total divergence is precisely what is defined as $d_{XY}$, the mean number of differences between a sequence from population $X$ and a sequence from population $Y$. Therefore, the mathematical expression for $F_{ST}$ is the ratio of the net divergence to the absolute divergence:\n$$F_{ST} = \\frac{D_a}{d_{XY}}$$\nThe problem also provides the definition for the net molecular divergence, $D_a$, as:\n$$D_a = d_{XY} - \\bar{\\pi}$$\nwhere $\\bar{\\pi}$ is the average within-population nucleotide diversity. By substituting the expression for $D_a$ into the formula for $F_{ST}$, we derive the final expression for $F_{ST}$ in terms of the given quantities $d_{XY}$ and $\\bar{\\pi}$:\n$$F_{ST} = \\frac{d_{XY} - \\bar{\\pi}}{d_{XY}}$$\nThis can be equivalently written as $F_{ST} = 1 - \\frac{\\bar{\\pi}}{d_{XY}}$, which represents the proportion of total divergence ($d_{XY}$) that is not accounted for by the average within-population diversity ($\\bar{\\pi}$).\n\nSecond, we compute the numerical value of $F_{ST}$. The provided data are:\nWithin-population diversity for population $1$: $\\pi_{1} = 0.008$\nWithin-population diversity for population $2$: $\\pi_{2} = 0.004$\nAbsolute divergence between populations $1$ and $2$: $d_{XY} = 0.012$\n\nWe begin by calculating the average within-population diversity, $\\bar{\\pi}$, using its definition:\n$$\\bar{\\pi} = \\frac{\\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2}}{2} = \\frac{0.008 + 0.004}{2} = \\frac{0.012}{2} = 0.006$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values of $d_{XY}$ and the calculated $\\bar{\\pi}$ into our derived formula for $F_{ST}$:\n$$F_{ST} = \\frac{d_{XY} - \\bar{\\pi}}{d_{XY}} = \\frac{0.012 - 0.006}{0.012} = \\frac{0.006}{0.012}$$\nThis simplifies to the exact value:\n$$F_{ST} = 0.5$$\n\nThird, we interpret the magnitude of this $F_{ST}$ value. The Fixation Index, $F_{ST}$, measures the degree of genetic differentiation between populations, with a theoretical range from $0$ (no differentiation) to $1$ (complete differentiation, where populations are fixed for different alleles). An $F_{ST}$ value of $0.5$ indicates that exactly half ($50\\%$) of the total nucleotide divergence observed between these two populations at this genomic window is due to net divergence—that is, nucleotide substitutions that have become fixed or are at high frequency differences between them. The other half is attributable to polymorphism that is still segregating within the populations. In the search for genomic islands of divergence, an $F_{ST}$ of $0.5$ is a high value, signifying substantial differentiation.

The provided statistics—absolute divergence ($d_{XY}$), nucleotide diversity ($\\pi$), and the fixation index ($F_{ST}$)—are standard measures used to infer evolutionary processes. The values themselves are realistic for many diverging populations. The scenario described, a \"genomic island\" of high relative differentiation ($F_{ST}$) coupled with specific patterns in absolute divergence ($d_{XY}$) and within-population diversity ($\\pi$), is a canonical topic of research and theoretical modeling in evolutionary biology. The problem requires interpretation of these patterns based on foundational definitions, which is a standard scientific exercise. The problem is self-contained, its premises are factually sound within the context of population genetics models, and it is free of ambiguity or contradiction.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed to a full solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe core of the problem is to distinguish between two main hypotheses that can generate a \"genomic island of divergence\" (a region of elevated $F_{ST}$):\n1.  A true, localized barrier to gene flow (e.g., due to a locus involved in reproductive isolation).\n2.  The effect of linked selection (either positive or background selection) in a region of the genome, often associated with low recombination.\n\nTo evaluate these hypotheses, we must consider the precise definitions and expected behaviors of the key summary statistics.\n\n-   **Absolute Divergence ($d_{XY}$)**: This statistic measures the average number of nucleotide differences between a pair of sequences, one randomly chosen from population $X$ and one from population $Y$. In a simple model, $d_{XY}$ is proportional to the average time to the most recent common ancestor ($T_{MRCA}$) for such a pair of sequences. A true, locus-specific barrier to gene flow would mean that migrant alleles at this specific locus are selected against, reducing the effective rate of gene exchange locally. This would cause the lineages sampled from the two populations at this locus to remain separate for a longer time, increasing their $T_{MRCA}$ relative to the rest of the genome where gene flow is higher. Consequently, a true barrier to gene flow is expected to produce a distinct **peak** in $d_{XY}$ at the barrier locus. The problem states that $d_{XY}$ is approximately constant across the chromosome. This evidence directly contradicts the prediction for a true localized barrier.\n\n-   **Within-Population Diversity ($\\pi$)**: This measures the average number of nucleotide differences between a pair of sequences sampled from the *same* population. It is sensitive to local forces that affect the entire genealogy within that population, most notably selection. A selective sweep (strong positive selection for a new beneficial mutation) or background selection (purifying selection against recurrent deleterious mutations) will reduce the effective population size experienced by linked neutral sites, thereby purging variation and causing a local **trough** in $\\pi$. The data show that $\\pi_X$ and $\\pi_Y$ are indeed strongly reduced in the focal window (e.g., from $\\approx 0.0045$ to $\\approx 0.0012$).\n\n-   **Fixation Index ($F_{ST}$)**: This is a measure of *relative* differentiation. A common and intuitive definition relates it to the other statistics: $F_{ST} = 1 - \\pi_S / \\pi_T$, where $\\pi_S$ is the average within-population diversity (here, $(\\pi_X+\\pi_Y)/2$) and $\\pi_T$ is the total diversity, which incorporates both within- and between-population differences. A useful approximation in many scenarios is given by $F_{ST} \\approx 1 - \\pi_S/d_{XY}$. This ratio structure is critical. An increase in $F_{ST}$ can be caused either by an increase in between-population differentiation (increasing $d_{XY}$) or by a decrease in within-population diversity ($\\pi_S$).\n\n### Synthesis\nThe data present a clear picture:\n1.  $d_{XY}$ is constant, which argues *against* a true, localized barrier to gene flow elevating the local between-population coalescent time.\n2.  $\\pi_X$ and $\\pi_Y$ are strongly reduced, which points towards the action of linked selection reducing diversity within each population.\n3.  $F_{ST}$ is elevated.\n\nCombining these observations through the lens of the equation $F_{ST} \\approx 1 - \\pi_S/d_{XY}$: the numerator of the fraction, $\\pi_S$, has decreased substantially in the focal window, while the denominator, $d_{XY}$, has remained constant. A simple mathematical consequence of decreasing the numerator in a fraction being subtracted from $1$ is an increase in the final value. Thus, the elevated $F_{ST}$ is not an indicator of a true barrier but is an arithmetic artifact of the reduced local diversity ($\\pi_S$) caused by linked selection. This pattern is the classic signature of a \"false\" genomic island generated by processes other than reduced gene flow.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The focal window constitutes a true barrier to gene flow, because a high $F_{ST}$ directly indicates restricted migration, and the constancy of $d_{XY}$ is irrelevant to detecting barriers.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. A high $F_{ST}$ is a measure of relative differentiation and can be inflated by reduced within-population diversity, so it does not \"directly indicate\" restricted migration. Furthermore, the behavior of absolute divergence, $d_{XY}$, is critically important for distinguishing between a true barrier (which should elevate $d_{XY}$) and other phenomena. Claiming its constancy is irrelevant demonstrates a severe misunderstanding of the underlying theory.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The focal window does not support a true barrier to gene flow; the elevated $F_{ST}$ with constant $d_{XY}$ is best explained by reduced within-population diversity (e.g., linked selection in low recombination) inflating relative differentiation, whereas a true barrier should elevate $d_{XY}$ above background.**\nThis statement is entirely correct and represents the consensus scientific interpretation of such data patterns. It correctly negates the \"true barrier\" hypothesis. It accurately identifies the causal chain: linked selection reduces within-population diversity ($\\pi_S$), which in turn inflates the relative measure $F_{ST}$ when absolute divergence ($d_{XY}$) is constant. It also correctly states the key prediction for a true barrier—an elevated $d_{XY}$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The focal window constitutes a true barrier to gene flow, because constant $d_{XY}$ confirms a uniform mutation rate, so a high $F_{ST}$ must arise from selection against migrants rather than other processes.**\nThis constitutes flawed reasoning. While constant $d_{XY}$ is consistent with the assumption of a uniform mutation rate, it does not force the conclusion of a barrier. In fact, as argued above, it argues against one. The assertion that a high $F_{ST}$ *must* arise from selection against migrants is a non sequitur, as it entirely ignores the more parsimonious and well-supported alternative explanation involving linked selection and reduced local diversity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The data are insufficient to evaluate barrier status; without explicit recombination maps one cannot interpret patterns in $F_{ST}$ or $d_{XY}$, even if $d_{XY}$ is constant.**\nThis position is excessively nihilistic and incorrect. While a recombination map provides complementary evidence (the linked selection hypothesis predicts the focal window should lie in a region of low recombination), its absence does not render the primary data ($d_{XY}$, $\\pi$, $F_{ST}$) uninterpretable. The specific combination of observed statistics is highly informative and provides strong evidence to distinguish between the primary competing hypotheses.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The focal window does not support a true barrier to gene flow, because background selection would be expected to decrease $F_{ST}$, so the focal $F_{ST}$ peak most likely reflects a technical artifact rather than a biological process.**\nThis statement contains a critical factual error. Background selection, by reducing local within-population diversity ($\\pi_S$), is expected to *increase* $F_{ST}$, not decrease it. Since the premise of the argument is wrong, the conclusion is unsound. The observed pattern is not a technical artifact but a well-documented biological phenomenon resulting from the interplay of selection, mutation, and drift.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2718691"}, {"introduction": "Moving from identifying islands to understanding their formation, we can build theoretical models to predict their physical properties.

This requires a three-step derivation: first, modeling the effective migration rate, $m_e$, as a function of recombination; second, expressing genomic differentiation, $F(c)$, in terms of this effective rate; and third, solving for the width based on the profile of $F(c)$.\n\n**1. Effective Migration Rate ($m_e$)**\n\nConsider a neutral locus at a recombination distance $c$ from a selected locus. In the two-deme model described, one allele at the selected locus is favored in deme $1$ and disfavored in deme $2$, and vice versa. A migrant haplotype carries a neutral allele from its source deme, but it is linked to the allele that is maladaptive in the recipient deme. This maladaptive allele has a selective disadvantage of $s$.\n\nUpon arrival in the new deme, this migrant haplotype is subject to two competing processes:\n-   **Purging by selection**: The haplotype is eliminated from the population due to the negative fitness effect of the linked maladaptive allele. The characteristic rate of this process is proportional to the selection coefficient, $s$.\n-   **Recombination**: The neutral allele is decoupled from the maladaptive background and placed onto a locally adapted genetic background. This occurs at a rate $c$ per generation.\n\nThe neutral allele successfully introgresses only if recombination occurs before the lineage is purged by selection. The probability of a migrant lineage escaping the selective purge via recombination, $P_{\\text{escape}}$, can be approximated as the ratio of the rate of recombination to the sum of the rates of recombination and selection. This classical result from the theory of genetic barriers is given by:\n$$\nP_{\\text{escape}} \\approx \\frac{c}{c+s}\n$$\nThe effective migration rate, $m_e(c)$, for the neutral locus is the product of the nominal migration rate, $m$, and this probability of escape:\n$$\nm_e(c) = m \\cdot P_{\\textescape} = m \\frac{c}{c+s}\n$$\nThis function correctly captures the limiting behaviors: when linkage is absolute ($c=0$), the effective migration rate is zero ($m_e(0)=0$). When the neutral locus is unlinked ($c \\to \\infty$), the effective migration rate approaches the nominal rate ($m_e(c) \\to m$).\n\n**2. Equilibrium Differentiation Profile ($F(c)$)**\n\nThe problem directs us to use the standard relationship between the fixation index, $F_{ST}$, and migration rate in a structured population. For a neutral locus under Wright's island model, the equilibrium $F_{ST}$ is determined by the balance between genetic drift, which increases differentiation, and migration, which homogenizes populations. This relationship is given by:\n$$\nF_{ST} = \\frac{1}{1 + 4N_e m}\n$$\nwhere $N_e$ is the effective size of each deme and $m$ is the migration rate. In our case, the relevant migration rate for a linked neutral locus is the effective rate, $m_e(c)$. By substituting $m_e(c)$ into this formula, we obtain the expected differentiation, $F(c)$, as a function of the recombination fraction $c$:\n$$\nF(c) = \\frac{1}{1 + 4N_e m_e(c)} = \\frac{1}{1 + 4N_e m \\left(\\frac{c}{c+s}\\right)}\n$$\nIt is important to note that the neutral mutation rate, $\\mu$, does not appear in this formulation. This is a standard result from models of identity by descent, where the equilibrium structure depends on the rates of coalescence (related to $N_e$) and migration ($m$), under the common assumption that mutation rates are much smaller than these other rates ($\\mu \\ll m$ and $\\mu \\ll 1/N_e$). Given the parameters $\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-8}$, $m = 5 \\times 10^{-4}$, and $N_e = 10^5$, this assumption holds, and the width $W$ will not depend on $\\mu$.\n\n**3. Full Width at Half Maximum ($W$)**\n\nThe full width at half maximum ($W$) is defined based on the differentiation profile $F(c)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the peak and baseline levels of differentiation.\n-   **Peak differentiation ($F_{peak}$)** occurs at the selected locus itself, where $c=0$.\n    $$\n    F_{peak} = F(0) = \\frac{1}{1 + 4N_e m \\left(\\frac{0}{0+s}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{1+0} = 1\n    $$\n-   **Baseline differentiation ($F_{base}$)** occurs at loci far from the selected site, where linkage is negligible ($c \\to \\infty$).\n    $$\n    F_{base} = \\lim_{c \\to \\infty} F(c) = \\lim_{c \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + 4N_e m \\left(\\frac{c}{c+s}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 + 4N_e m}\n    $$\n\nNext, we define the half-maximum differentiation level, $F_{1/2}$, as the midpoint between the peak and the baseline.\n$$\nF_{1/2} = \\frac{F_{peak} + F_{base}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{1 + 4N_e m}\\right)\n$$\nThe half-width corresponds to the recombination fraction, $c_{1/2}$, for which the differentiation equals this half-maximum level, i.e., $F(c_{1/2}) = F_{1/2}$.
