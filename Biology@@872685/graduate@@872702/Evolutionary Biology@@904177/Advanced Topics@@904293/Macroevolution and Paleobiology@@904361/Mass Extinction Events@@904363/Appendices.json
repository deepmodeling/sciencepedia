We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities: the effective isotopic composition of the injected carbon, $\\delta_{i}$, and the total mass of this carbon injection, $M_{i}$. We will solve for these quantities in a sequential manner.\n\nFirst, we determine the effective isotopic composition of the injected carbon, $\\delta_{i}$. The problem states that the injection is a mixture of two sources: volcanic carbon dioxide with isotopic composition $\\delta_{v} = -5$ per mil and thermogenic methane-derived carbon with isotopic composition $\\delta_{m} = -35$ per mil. The mole fraction of the methane-derived carbon is given as $f_{m} = 0.30$.

This is an application of the principle of conservation of mass for both the total carbon and the isotope ${}^{13}\\mathrm{C}$. The total mass of carbon and its total isotopic value (mass multiplied by isotopic composition) must be conserved before and after the injection event.\n\nLet $M_{0}$ and $\\delta_{0}$ be the mass and isotopic composition of the pre-event exogenic carbon reservoir, respectively.

It provides a formalizable model based on standard principles in stochastic processes and their application in paleobiology. All necessary information is provided, and there are no internal contradictions. The problem is a valid exercise in deriving a result from first principles.\n\nThe objective is to derive the bias of the estimator $\\max(L_1, \\dots, L_n)$ for the true extinction time $T$. The bias is defined as $\\mathbb{E}[\\max(L_1, \\dots, L_n)] - T$. The variables $L_i$ for $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ are the last observed fossil occurrence times for $n$ independent taxa, which all go extinct at time $T$. By definition, $L_i \\le T$ for all $i$. The sampling of fossils for each taxon is a homogeneous Poisson process with rate $q$.\n\nTo facilitate the analysis, we introduce a set of auxiliary random variables, $X_i$, representing the time gap, or shortfall, between the true extinction time $T$ and the last observed fossil for each taxon $i$.\n$$X_i = T - L_i$$\nSince $L_i \\le T$, we have $X_i \\ge 0$. These shortfall times, $X_i$, are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) because the fossil sampling processes for the $n$ taxa are stipulated to be independent and share the same rate $q$.\n\nThe problem asks for the expectation of the maximum of the last occurrences, $M = \\max(L_1, \\dots, L_n)$. We can express $M$ in terms of the shortfall variables $X_i$:\n$$M = \\max(L_1, \\dots, L_n) = \\max(T - X_1, \\dots, T - X_n)$$\nSince $T$ is a constant, this is equivalent to:\n$$M = T - \\min(X_1, \\dots, X_n)$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected value of $M$ is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[M] = \\mathbb{E}[T - \\min(X_1, \\dots, X_n)] = T - \\mathbb{E}[\\min(X_1, \\dots, X_n)]$$\nThe problem is thus reduced to finding the expected value of the minimum of the shortfall times, $\\mathbb{E}[\\min(X_i)]$. To do this, we must first determine the probability distribution of a single shortfall time $X_i$, and then the distribution of the minimum of $n$ such variables.\n\nThe problem states that fossil sampling is a homogeneous Poisson process with rate $q$. It further specifies to \"assume a stationary Poisson process on $(-\\infty, T]$\". The variable $X_i = T - L_i$ is the time elapsed from the fixed point $T$ backwards to the most recent event (the last fossil find). This is known as the backward recurrence time of the process. For a stationary Poisson process, a key result is that the distribution of the backward recurrence time is identical to the distribution of the inter-event waiting time. Fact (i) states that the waiting time between events in a homogeneous Poisson process with rate $q$ follows the exponential distribution with rate $q$. Therefore, each shortfall time $X_i$ is a random variable following an exponential distribution with rate $q$.\nThe probability density function (PDF) of $X_i$ is $f_{X_i}(x) = q \\exp(-qx)$ for $x \\ge 0$, and the survival function is $S_{X_i}(x) = P(X_i > x) = \\exp(-qx)$ for $x \\ge 0$.\n\nNext, we determine the distribution of $X_{\\min} = \\min(X_1, \\dots, X_n)$. We use fact (ii), which states that for independent random variables, the survival function of their minimum is the product of their individual survival functions.\n$$S_{X_{\\min}}(x) = P(X_{\\min} > x) = P(X_1 > x, X_2 > x, \\dots, X_n > x)$$\nDue to the independence of the $X_i$:\n$$S_{X_{\\min}}(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(X_i > x) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} S_{X_i}(x)$$\nSince the $X_i$ are identically distributed with $S_{X_i}(x) = \\exp(-qx)$:\n$$S_{X_{\\min}}(x) = (\\exp(-qx))^n = \\exp(-(nq)x)$$\nThis is the survival function of an exponential distribution with a new rate equal to $nq$. Thus, $X_{\\min}$ is an exponential random variable with rate $nq$.\n\nNow, we must find the expectation of $X_{\\min}$. For a random variable $Z$ following an exponential distribution with rate $\\lambda$, its expectation $\\mathbb{E}[Z]$ is derived from first principles using its PDF, $f_Z(z) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda z)$ for $z \\ge 0$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[Z] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} z f_Z(z) dz = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} z \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda z) dz$$\nWe use integration by parts, $\\int u dv = uv - \\int v du$. Let $u=z$ and $dv = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda z) dz$.
