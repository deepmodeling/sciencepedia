You will then incorporate a \"mismatch factor\" to quantify how a uniform increase in mutation rates, potentially driven by modern environmental conditions, leads to a dramatic, age-dependent amplification of cancer incidence.", "problem": "In the Armitage–Doll multistage model of carcinogenesis, malignant transformation requires $k$ sequential, irreversible, and rate-limiting somatic transitions occurring within a single susceptible cellular lineage.

It is a proper exercise in mathematical biology, specifically in the application of probability theory to model carcinogenesis. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation from fundamental assumptions. We are given a $k$-stage model of carcinogenesis. For a single cellular lineage, the total time to malignant transformation, $T_k$, is the sum of $k$ independent waiting times, $T_k = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\tau_i$. Each waiting time $\\tau_i$ is exponentially distributed with a constant rate $\\mu_i$, i.e., $\\tau_i \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\mu_i)$.\n\n**1. Single-Lineage Cumulative Transformation Probability $F(a)$**\n\nFirst, we must derive the leading-order asymptotic of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) $F(a) = \\mathbb{P}(T_k \\le a)$ for small age $a$. The random variable $T_k$ follows a hypoexponential distribution. A direct calculation of its CDF is possible but cumbersome. A more systematic approach for finding the small-$a$ behavior is to analyze the probability density function (PDF), $f_{T_k}(a)$, near $a=0$.\n\nThe PDF of $T_k$ is the convolution of the individual exponential PDFs. However, a more rigorous method is to use the Laplace transform. The Laplace transform of the PDF of $\\tau_i$ is given by:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}\\{f_{\\tau_i}(t)\\}(s) = \\hat{f}_{\\tau_i}(s) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(-s \\tau_i)] = \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-st) \\mu_i \\exp(-\\mu_i t) dt = \\frac{\\mu_i}{s+\\mu_i} $$\nSince the waiting times $\\tau_i$ are independent, the Laplace transform of the PDF of their sum $T_k$ is the product of the individual transforms:\n$$ \\hat{f}_{T_k}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f_{T_k}(t)\\}(s) = \\prod_{i=1}^k \\hat{f}_{\\tau_i}(s) = \\prod_{i=1}^k \\frac{\\mu_i}{s+\\mu_i} $$\nThe behavior of $f_{T_k}(t)$ for small $t$ is related to the behavior of its Laplace transform $\\hat{f}_{T_k}(s)$ for large $s$. Specifically, the first non-zero term in the Taylor series of $f_{T_k}(t)$ around $t=0$ can be found from the highest-order term in the asymptotic expansion of $\\hat{f}_{T_k}(s)$ in powers of $1/s$. For large $s$:\n$$ \\hat{f}_{T_k}(s) = \\prod_{i=1}^k \\frac{\\mu_i}{s(1 + \\mu_i/s)} = \\frac{1}{s^k} \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^k \\mu_i\\right) \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^k (1 + \\mu_i/s)^{-1}\\right) $$\nAs $s \\to \\infty$, the leading-order behavior is:\n$$ \\hat{f}_{T_k}(s) \\sim \\frac{1}{s^k} \\prod_{i=1}^k \\mu_i $$\nWe know the inverse Laplace transform of $1/s^k$ is $\\frac{t^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} u(t)$, where $u(t)$ is the Heaviside step function. Therefore, by the properties of the Laplace transform, the leading-order behavior of the PDF for small $t > 0$ is:\n$$ f_{T_k}(t) \\approx \\frac{t^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \\prod_{i=1}^k \\mu_i $$\nThe cumulative distribution function $F(a) = \\mathbb{P}(T_k \\le a)$ is the integral of the PDF from $0$ to $a$:\n$$ F(a) = \\int_0^a f_{T_k}(t) dt $$\nSubstituting the leading-order approximation for $f_{T_k}(t)$:\n$$ F(a) \\approx \\int_0^a \\frac{t^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^k \\mu_i\\right) dt = \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^k \\mu_i\\right) \\frac{1}{(k-1)!} \\left[\\frac{t^k}{k}\\right]_0^a $$\nThis gives the leading-order small-$a$ asymptotic for the cumulative probability of transformation in a single lineage:\n$$ F(a) \\approx \\frac{a^k}{k!} \\prod_{i=1}^k \\mu_i $$\n\n**2. Population Age-Specific Incidence Density $I(a)$**\n\nThe problem provides the definition for the age-specific incidence density $I(a)$ for the population of $N$ independent lineages. Under the rare-disease approximation, the probability of any single lineage transforming is small, and the probability of multiple lineages transforming is negligible. Thus, the total incidence rate is the rate for one lineage multiplied by the number of lineages:\n$$ I(a) \\approx N f_{T_k}(a) $$\nUsing the leading-order expression for $f_{T_k}(a)$ derived in the previous step, we obtain the leading-order expression for the incidence density:\n$$ I(a) \\approx N \\frac{a^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \\prod_{i=1}^k \\mu_i $$\nThis result, $I(a) \\propto a^{k-1}$, is the hallmark of the Armitage-Doll model.\n\n**3. Incidence Under the Mismatch Hypothesis $I_{\\text{modern}}(a)$**\n\nThe mismatch hypothesis is modeled by a uniform multiplicative increase in all transition rates. Each ancestral rate $\\mu_i$ is replaced by a modern rate $\\mu_i' = m \\mu_i$, where $m > 1$. The number of susceptible lineages $N$ remains unchanged.\n\nTo find the modern-age incidence $I_{\\text{modern}}(a)$, we simply substitute the new rates $\\mu_i'$ into the expression for $I(a)$. The structure of the derivation remains identical.\n$$ I_{\\text{modern}}(a) = N \\frac{a^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \\prod_{i=1}^k \\mu_i' $$\nNow, substitute $\\mu_i' = m \\mu_i$:\n$$ I_{\\text{modern}}(a) = N \\frac{a^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \\prod_{i=1}^k (m \\mu_i) $$\nThe product term can be separated:\n$$ \\prod_{i=1}^k (m \\mu_i) = \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^k m\\right) \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^k \\mu_i\\right) = m^k \\prod_{i=1}^k \\mu_i $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $I_{\\text{modern}}(a)$ yields the final result. The leading-order expression for the modern-age incidence is:\n$$ I_{\\text{modern}}(a) = N \\frac{a^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} m^k \\prod_{i=1}^k \\mu_i $$\nThis expression is a closed-form function of all specified parameters: $N, k, \\{\\mu_i\\}, m,$ and $a$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{N m^k a^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \\prod_{i=1}^{k} \\mu_i}\n$$", "id": "2711353"}, {"introduction": "The process of carcinogenesis, once initiated, gives way to somatic evolution within the tumor itself, generating a complex ecosystem of genetically distinct subclones.

Consequently, the fraction of normal cells is $(1-p)$.\nNormal cells are diploid, having $2$ copies of each autosomal locus.\nIn a specific genomic region, let the total copy number in cancer cells be $C$.\nA specific mutation is present in a fraction $f$ of the cancer cells. Within this fraction of cells, there are $m$ mutated copies.\n\nThe total number of allelic copies at the locus, per average cell in the mixture, is a weighted average of the copy numbers in the normal and cancer cell populations:\n$$\n\\text{Total Copies} \\propto (1-p) \\cdot 2 + p \\cdot C\n$$\nThe number of mutated allelic copies, per average cell in the mixture, comes only from the fraction of cancer cells that carry the mutation:\n$$\n\\text{Mutated Copies} \\propto p \\cdot f \\cdot m\n$$\nThe expected VAF is the ratio of these quantities:\n$$\nV(p, C, f, m) = \\frac{p \\cdot f \\cdot m}{2(1-p) + p \\cdot C}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the expected VAF peak position for a class of mutations characterized by parameters $(p, C, f, m)$.\n\nWe are given $p = 0.68$.

The total copy number in cancer cells is $C = C_1 = 3$. The mutation arose before duplication, so the mutated chromosome was duplicated, resulting in $m=2$ mutated copies per cancer cell.\n$$\nv_{\\text{pre}} = V(p=0.68, C=3, f=1, m=2) = \\frac{0.68 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2}{2(1-0.68) + 0.68 \\cdot 3}\n$$\n$$\nv_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{1.36}{2(0.32) + 2.04} = \\frac{1.36}{0.64 + 2.04} = \\frac{1.36}{2.68} \\approx 0.5074626...\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $v_{\\text{pre}} = 0.5075$.\n\n**2.

VAF for Class 3 (private subclonal SNVs on $S_2$)**:\nFor this class, the mutations are private to subclone $B$, so their cellular fraction among cancer cells is $f = f_B$. The locus is on segment $S_2$, which is diploid in cancer cells, so $C = C_2 = 2$. The SNV is present on one chromosome, so $m=1$.\nThe expected VAF, $v_{\\text{sub}}$, is expressed in terms of $f_B$:\n$$\nv_{\\text{sub}} = V(p=0.68, C=2, f=f_B, m=1) = \\frac{0.68 \\cdot f_B \\cdot 1}{2(1-0.68) + 0.68 \\cdot 2}\n$$\n$$\nv_{\\text{sub}} = \\frac{0.68 \\cdot f_B}{2(0.32) + 1.36} = \\frac{0.68 \\cdot f_B}{0.64 + 1.36} = \\frac{0.68 \\cdot f_B}{2} = 0.34 \\cdot f_B\n$$\n\n**4.

We set our expression for $v_{\\text{sub}}$ equal to this value to solve for $f_B$:\n$$\n0.119 = 0.34 \\cdot f_B\n$$\n$$\nf_B = \\frac{0.119}{0.34} = 0.35\n$$\nThe cellular fraction of subclone $B$ within the cancer cell population is $0.35$.\n\nThe final result is the row vector $[v_{\\text{pre}}, v_{\\text{post}}, v_{\\text{sub}}, f_B]$, with each component rounded to four significant figures.\n$v_{\\text{pre}} \\approx 0.5075$\n$v_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.2537$\n- $v_{\\text{sub}}$ is the given observed value, $0.119$. To present with four significant figures, this is $0.1190$.\n- $f_B = 0.35$. To present with four significant figures, this is $0.3500$.\n\nThe final vector is constructed from these values.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.5075 & 0.2537 & 0.1190 & 0.3500\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2711375"}]}
