It does not violate any criteria for invalidity. The assumptions provided are standard simplifications used for such preliminary calculations in paleogenomics.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows.\n\nLet $N_{raw}$ be the total number of raw reads required.\nThe target effective coverage, $C_{eff}$, is defined as the total number of unique, on-target bases, which we will call $B_{eff}$, divided by the genome size, $G$.\n$$C_{eff} = \\frac{B_{eff}}{G}$$\nFrom this, the total number of effective bases required to achieve the target coverage is:\n$$B_{eff} = C_{eff} \\times G$$\nNow, we must relate $B_{eff}$ to the total number of raw reads, $N_{raw}$. The process involves several steps reflecting the data processing pipeline.\n\nFirst, the total number of raw reads, $N_{raw}$, is filtered by the endogenous content fraction, $f_{endo}$, to determine the number of reads originating from the target genome, $N_{endo}$.\n$$N_{endo} = N_{raw} \\times f_{endo}$$\nSecond, these endogenous reads are subject to deduplication. A fraction $f_{dup}$ of these reads are identified as duplicates and removed. The remaining fraction of unique reads is $(1 - f_{dup})$. The number of unique endogenous reads, $N_{unique}$, is therefore:\n$$N_{unique} = N_{endo} \\times (1 - f_{dup}) = N_{raw} \\times f_{endo} \\times (1 - f_{dup})$$\nAccording to the problem's assumptions, each of these unique endogenous reads contributes its full length, $L$, to the effective base count. Thus, the total number of effective bases, $B_{eff}$, can be expressed as:\n$$B_{eff} = N_{unique} \\times L = N_{raw} \\times f_{endo} \\times (1 - f_{dup}) \\times L$$\nWe now have two expressions for $B_{eff}$. By equating them, we can construct an equation to solve for the unknown quantity, $N_{raw}$.\n$$C_{eff} \\times G = N_{raw} \\times f_{endo} \\times (1 - f_{dup}) \\times L$$\nRearranging to solve for $N_{raw}$:\n$$N_{raw} = \\frac{C_{eff} \\times G}{f_{endo} \\times (1 - f_{dup}) \\times L}$$\nNow, we substitute the given values into this expression:\n- $C_{eff} = 0.5$\n- $G = 3 \\times 10^{9}$\n- $f_{endo} = 0.05$\n- $f_{dup} = 0.30$\n- $L = 75$\n\n$$N_{raw} = \\frac{0.5 \\times (3 \\times 10^{9})}{0.05 \\times (1 - 0.30) \\times 75}$$\nWe calculate the numerator and the denominator separately.\nNumerator:\n$$0.5 \\times 3 \\times 10^{9} = 1.5 \\times 10^{9}$$\nDenominator:\n$$0.05 \\times (1 - 0.30) \\times 75 = 0.05 \\times 0.70 \\times 75 = 0.035 \\times 75 = 2.625$$\nNow, we perform the division:\n$$N_{raw} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{9}}{2.625}$$\n$$N_{raw} = \\frac{1500}{2625} \\times 10^{9} = \\frac{4}{7} \\times 10^{9} \\approx 0.57142857... \\times 10^{9}$$\nTo express this in standard scientific notation, we write:\n$$N_{raw} \\approx 5.7142857... \\times 10^{8}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$N_{raw} \\approx 5.71 \\times 10^{8}$$\nThis is the total number of raw sequencing reads that must be generated to meet the specified effective coverage goal under the given conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.71 \\times 10^8}$$", "id": "2691892"}, {"introduction": "Authenticity is the cornerstone of paleogenomics, and quantifying the evidence for a sample's ancient origin is a critical first step in data analysis.
