The assumptions, while simplifications of reality, are standard and reasonable in the context of many microbial evolution experiments. The problem is not trivial and requires a rigorous application of statistical theory. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Proceed with Solution**\n\n**Derivation of the Estimator $\\hat{s}$**\n\nThe population dynamics for the two strains are given by:\n$$N_A(t) = N_A(0)\\exp(m_A t)$$\n$$N_B(t) = N_B(0)\\exp(m_B t)$$\nWe consider the ratio of the abundances of the two strains at time $t$:\n$$ \\frac{N_A(t)}{N_B(t)} = \\frac{N_A(0)\\exp(m_A t)}{N_B(0)\\exp(m_B t)} = \\frac{N_A(0)}{N_B(0)} \\exp\\left( (m_A - m_B)t \\right) $$\nUsing the definition of the selection coefficient, $s = m_A - m_B$, we have:\n$$ \\frac{N_A(t)}{N_B(t)} = \\frac{N_A(0)}{N_B(0)} \\exp(st) $$\nTo find an expression for $s$, we rearrange the equation and take the natural logarithm:\n$$ \\exp(st) = \\frac{N_A(t)/N_B(t)}{N_A(0)/N_B(0)} $$\n$$ st = \\ln\\left( \\frac{N_A(t)/N_B(t)}{N_A(0)/N_B(0)} \\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A(t)}{N_B(t)}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A(0)}{N_B(0)}\\right) $$\nThus, the selection coefficient is given by:\n$$ s = \\frac{1}{t} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A(t)}{N_B(t)}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A(0)}{N_B(0)}\\right) \\right] $$\nThis equation relates $s$ to the true, unobserved population ratios. We must construct an estimator from the observed counts. The true ratio at time $\\tau$ can be expressed in terms of the true frequency $p_\\tau = N_A(\\tau) / (N_A(\\tau) + N_B(\\tau))$ as $N_A(\\tau)/N_B(\\tau) = p_\\tau/(1-p_\\tau)$. We estimate these true frequencies using the sample frequencies from the cytometry data:\n$$ \\hat{p}_0 = \\frac{A_0}{N_0} = \\frac{A_0}{A_0+B_0} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\hat{p}_t = \\frac{A_t}{N_t} = \\frac{A_t}{A_t+B_t} $$\nThe corresponding estimated ratios are:\n$$ \\frac{\\hat{p}_0}{1-\\hat{p}_0} = \\frac{A_0/N_0}{B_0/N_0} = \\frac{A_0}{B_0} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\hat{p}_t}{1-\\hat{p}_t} = \\frac{A_t/N_t}{B_t/N_t} = \\frac{A_t}{B_t} $$\nUsing the plug-in principle, we substitute these estimates into the equation for $s$ to obtain the estimator $\\hat{s}$:\n$$ \\hat{s} = \\frac{1}{t} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_t}{B_t}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_0}{B_0}\\right) \\right] $$\nThis can be written more compactly as:\n$$ \\hat{s} = \\frac{1}{t} \\ln\\left( \\frac{A_t B_0}{A_0 B_t} \\right) $$\nA regularity assumption for this estimator is that all counts $A_0, B_0, A_t, B_t$ must be strictly positive for the logarithms to be defined.\n\n**Derivation of the Variance Approximation $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{s})$**\n\nWe use the delta method to approximate the variance of $\\hat{s}$. The estimator $\\hat{s}$ is a function of the random variables $A_0$ and $A_t$ (since $B_0=N_0-A_0$ and $B_t=N_t-A_t$, where $N_0$ and $N_t$ are fixed sample sizes).

The random variables $A_0$ and $A_t$ are independent by the problem statement. According to the delta method, the variance of $\\hat{s}$ is approximated by:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{s}) \\approx \\left( \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} \\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(A_0) + \\left( \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} \\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(A_t) $$\nwhere the partial derivatives are evaluated at the expected values of $A_0$ and $A_t$, which are $\\mathrm{E}[A_0] = N_0 p_0$ and $\\mathrm{E}[A_t] = N_t p_t$.\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivatives of $g(x,y) = \\frac{1}{t} [ \\ln(y) - \\ln(N_t-y) - \\ln(x) + \\ln(N_0-x) ]$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{t} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{N_0-x} \\right] = \\frac{1}{t} \\frac{-N_0+x-x}{x(N_0-x)} = -\\frac{N_0}{t x (N_0-x)} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = \\frac{1}{t} \\left[ \\frac{1}{y} - \\frac{-1}{N_t-y} \\right] = \\frac{1}{t} \\frac{N_t-y+y}{y(N_t-y)} = \\frac{N_t}{t y (N_t-y)} $$\nNext, we evaluate these derivatives at $x=\\mathrm{E}[A_0]=N_0 p_0$ and $y=\\mathrm{E}[A_t]=N_t p_t$:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} \\right|_{x=N_0 p_0} = -\\frac{N_0}{t (N_0 p_0) (N_0 - N_0 p_0)} = -\\frac{1}{t N_0 p_0 (1-p_0)} $$\n$$ \\left. \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=N_t p_t} = \\frac{N_t}{t (N_t p_t) (N_t - N_t p_t)} = \\frac{1}{t N_t p_t (1-p_t)} $$\nThe variances of the binomial random variables are $\\mathrm{Var}(A_0) = N_0 p_0 (1-p_0)$ and $\\mathrm{Var}(A_t) = N_t p_t (1-p_t)$.\nSubstituting these into the delta method formula:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{s}) \\approx \\left( -\\frac{1}{t N_0 p_0 (1-p_0)} \\right)^2 [N_0 p_0 (1-p_0)] + \\left( \\frac{1}{t N_t p_t (1-p_t)} \\right)^2 [N_t p_t (1-p_t)] $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{s}) \\approx \\frac{1}{t^2 N_0 p_0 (1-p_0)} + \\frac{1}{t^2 N_t p_t (1-p_t)} = \\frac{1}{t^2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{N_0 p_0 (1-p_0)} + \\frac{1}{N_t p_t (1-p_t)} \\right] $$\nThis approximation depends on the unknown true frequencies $p_0$ and $p_t$. As instructed, we use a plug-in approach, replacing the true frequencies with their sample estimates $\\hat{p}_0 = A_0/N_0$ and $\\hat{p}_t = A_t/N_t$. This yields an estimator for the variance, which we also denote by $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{s})$ for simplicity.\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{s}) \\approx \\frac{1}{t^2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{N_0 \\hat{p}_0 (1-\\hat{p}_0)} + \\frac{1}{N_t \\hat{p}_t (1-\\hat{p}_t)} \\right] $$\nLet's simplify the terms in the bracket:\n$$ \\frac{1}{N_0 \\hat{p}_0 (1-\\hat{p}_0)} = \\frac{1}{N_0 (A_0/N_0) (B_0/N_0)} = \\frac{N_0}{A_0 B_0} = \\frac{A_0+B_0}{A_0 B_0} = \\frac{1}{A_0} + \\frac{1}{B_0} $$\nSimilarly, for the term at time $t$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{N_t \\hat{p}_t (1-\\hat{p}_t)} = \\frac{1}{A_t} + \\frac{1}{B_t} $$\nSubstituting these back, we obtain the final expression for the variance approximation, expressed in terms of the observed counts:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{s}) \\approx \\frac{1}{t^2} \\left( \\frac{1}{A_0} + \\frac{1}{B_0} + \\frac{1}{A_t} + \\frac{1}{B_t} \\right) $$\nThis expression represents the estimated variance of our estimator $\\hat{s}$.\nThe two required expressions are thus derived.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{t} \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_t B_0}{A_0 B_t}\\right) & \\frac{1}{t^2} \\left( \\frac{1}{A_0} + \\frac{1}{B_0} + \\frac{1}{A_t} + \\frac{1}{B_t} \\right) \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2712517"}, {"introduction": "The effective population size, $N_e$, governs the strength of genetic drift and is a cornerstone of population genetics, but its estimation in real experiments can be subtle.

Since these terms are i.i.d., $\\mathrm{Var}(S) = \\sum \\mathrm{Var}(Y_{i}) = N_{0}\\mathrm{Var}(Y_{1})$. We use the law of total variance: $\\mathrm{Var}(Y_{i}) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(Y_{i}|X_{i})] + \\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[Y_{i}|X_{i}])$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y_{i}|X_{i}] = \\mathbb{E}[X_{i}K_{i}|X_{i}] = X_{i}\\mathbb{E}[K_{i}] = X_{i}\\mu_{K}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(Y_{i}|X_{i}) = \\mathrm{Var}(X_{i}K_{i}|X_{i}) = X_{i}^{2}\\mathrm{Var}(K_{i}) = X_{i}\\sigma_{K}^{2} \\quad (\\text{since } X_{i}^{2}=X_{i} \\text{ for Bernoulli})\n$$\nSo, $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(Y_{i}|X_{i})] = \\mathbb{E}[X_{i}\\sigma_{K}^{2}] = \\sigma_{K}^{2}\\mathbb{E}[X_{i}] = p\\sigma_{K}^{2}$.\nAnd, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[Y_{i}|X_{i}]) = \\mathrm{Var}(X_{i}\\mu_{K}) = \\mu_{K}^{2}\\mathrm{Var}(X_{i}) = \\mu_{K}^{2}p(1-p)$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(Y_{i}) = p\\sigma_{K}^{2} + \\mu_{K}^{2}p(1-p)\n$$\nTherefore, the variance of $S$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(S) = N_{0}\\left(p\\sigma_{K}^{2} + \\mu_{K}^{2}p(1-p)\\right)\n$$\nThe covariance of $S$ and $T$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cov}(S, T) = \\mathrm{Cov}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{0}} X_{i}K_{i}, \\sum_{j=1}^{N_{0}} K_{j}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{0}}\\sum_{j=1}^{N_{0}} \\mathrm{Cov}(X_{i}K_{i}, K_{j})\n$$\nFor $i \\neq j$, $X_{i}K_{i}$ and $K_{j}$ are independent, so $\\mathrm{Cov}(X_{i}K_{i}, K_{j}) = 0$.
