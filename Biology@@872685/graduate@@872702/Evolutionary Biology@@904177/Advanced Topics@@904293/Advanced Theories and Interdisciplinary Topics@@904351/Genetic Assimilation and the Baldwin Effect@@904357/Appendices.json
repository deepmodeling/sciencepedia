I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal is to design an experimental protocol that isolates selection on the cost of plasticity (related to $b$ and $c$) from selection on the adaptive value of plasticity (related to $b$ tracking $\\theta(x)$).\n\nThe log-fitness of an individual is:\n$$\n\\ln W(a,b,I|x) = -\\frac{(a + b(x-x_0) - \\theta(x))^2}{2\\omega^2} + I \\ln(1 - cb^2)\n$$\nUnder the weak selection approximation, the selection gradients on the population mean traits, $\\bar{a}$ and $\\bar{b}$, are given by the expectation of the partial derivatives of $\\ln W$ evaluated at the mean trait values.\n$$\n\\beta_a = E_{x,I}\\left[ \\frac{\\partial \\ln W}{\\partial a} \\right] \\approx E_{x,I}\\left[ -\\frac{\\bar{a} + \\bar{b}(x-x_0) - \\theta(x)}{\\omega^2} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_b = E_{x,I}\\left[ \\frac{\\partial \\ln W}{\\partial b} \\right] \\approx E_{x,I}\\left[ -\\frac{(\\bar{a} + \\bar{b}(x-x_0) - \\theta(x))}{\\omega^2}(x-x_0) + I \\frac{-2c\\bar{b}}{1-c\\bar{b}^2} \\right]\n$$\nUsing the approximation $c\\bar{b}^2 \\ll 1$, we have $\\ln(1-c\\bar{b}^2) \\approx -c\\bar{b}^2$ and $\\frac{-2c\\bar{b}}{1-c\\bar{b}^2} \\approx -2c\\bar{b}$. The gradient on $b$ becomes:\n$$\n\\beta_b \\approx E_{x,I}\\left[ -\\frac{(\\bar{a} + \\bar{b}(x-x_0) - \\theta(x))}{\\omega^2}(x-x_0) - 2c\\bar{b}I \\right]\n$$\nTo isolate selection on the cost of plasticity, we must eliminate the first term in the expression for $\\beta_b$, which represents selection on $b$ for its role in matching the phenotype $z$ to the optimum $\\theta(x)$. This term is proportional to $(x-x_0)$. The most direct way to make this term zero is to ensure that $x-x_0 = 0$ for all individuals in all generations.\n\nLet us now evaluate each option against this requirement.\n\n**Option A Analysis**\n\n-   **Protocol**: The environment is fixed at $x=x_0$. Two treatments are established: one with $q=0$ (so $I=0$ for all individuals) and one with $q=1$ (so $I=1$ for all individuals).\n-   **Derivation**: With $x=x_0$, the phenotype simplifies to $z = a$. The optimum is $\\theta(x_0) = \\theta_0$. The general expressions for the selection gradients become:\n    -   $\\beta_a = E_{I}\\left[ -\\frac{\\bar{a} - \\theta_0}{\\omega^2} \\right] = -\\frac{\\bar{a} - \\theta_0}{\\omega^2}$. This is independent of the induction treatment. In both treatments, selection will drive $\\bar{a}$ toward $\\theta_0$.\n    -   $\\beta_b \\approx E_{I}\\left[ -\\frac{(\\bar{a} - \\theta_0)}{\\omega^2}(0) - 2c\\bar{b}I \\right] = -2c\\bar{b} E[I] = -2c\\bar{b}q$.\n-   **In the uninduced treatment ($q=0$)**: $\\beta_a = -(\\bar{a}-\\theta_0)/\\omega^2$ and $\\beta_b \\approx 0$. Selection acts on $a$, but $b$ is neutral.\n-   **In the forced-induction treatment ($q=1$)**: $\\beta_a = -(\\bar{a}-\\theta_0)/\\omega^2$ and $\\beta_b \\approx -2c\\bar{b}$. Selection acts on $a$ as before, and there is now direct negative selection on $b$ due to its cost.\n-   **Conclusion**: This protocol successfully decouples selection on $a$ and $b$. The effect of plasticity on the phenotype is nullified by setting $x=x_0$, so the stabilizing selection component of fitness depends only on $a$. The cost component depends only on $b$ (and $I$). The comparison between the $q=0$ and $q=1$ treatments then perfectly isolates the effect of the induction cost. The predictions stated in the option follow directly: $\\bar{a}$ evolves to $\\theta_0$ in both treatments, while $\\bar{b}$ evolves toward $0$ (canalization) only in the $q=1$ treatment due to the cost. The subsequent test in a novel environment correctly predicts that the $q=0$ line, having retained its ancestral plasticity, would likely show higher fitness than the canalized $q=1$ line, which is a textbook illustration of a latent benefit of plasticity (related to the Baldwin effect).\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B Analysis**\n\n-   **Protocol**: Two environmental treatments, $x=x_0$ and $x=x_0+\\delta$, with forced induction ($q=1$, so $I=1$) in both.\n-   **Derivation**: In the $x=x_0+\\delta$ environment, the selection gradient on $b$ will be $\\beta_b \\approx -\\frac{(\\bar{a} + \\bar{b}\\delta - \\theta(x_0+\\delta))}{\\omega^2}\\delta - 2c\\bar{b}$.\n-   **Conclusion**: This expression for $\\beta_b$ contains two terms. The first term represents selection on $b$ for its role in tracking the optimum, and the second term is selection due to cost. The protocol does not separate these two sources of selection; it conflates them. Any observed difference in the evolution of $\\bar{b}$ between the two environments would be a composite result of differences in stabilizing selection and the constant selection from cost. This fails the primary objective.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C Analysis**\n\n-   **Protocol**: Maintain $x=x_0$ and $q=0$ ($I=0$) for all populations.\n-   **Derivation**: This is identical to the uninduced treatment in Option A. The selection gradients are $\\beta_a = -(\\bar{a}-\\theta_0)/\\omega^2$ and $\\beta_b \\approx 0$.\n-   **Conclusion**: Under the fitness function specified in the problem, there is no selection on $b$. The prediction that \"$\\bar{b}$ will decline due to selection against the maintenance cost\" is invalid because the model contains no such \"maintenance cost\". The only cost is an \"induction cost\" proportional to $(1-cb^2)^I$, which is non-existent when $I=0$. This option introduces an external assumption not justified by the problem statement.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D Analysis**\n\n-   **Protocol**: Two treatments with symmetric distributions of $x$ around $x_0$, but different variances. The induction is always off ($q=0$, so $I=0$).\n-   **Derivation**: Since $I=0$ always, the cost term $(1-cb^2)^I$ is always $1$. Thus, there is no selection on the cost parameter $c$. The fitness is purely from the stabilizing selection component. This protocol cannot, by design, test for the effect of plasticity cost as defined in the problem. It is designed to test for selection on the accuracy of plastic tracking. The selection gradient on $b$ would be related to making the reaction norm slope $b$ match the slope of the optimum $\\theta(x)$ across environments, but it would have no component related to $c$.\n-   **Conclusion**: This protocol fails to test for the plasticity cost. It addresses a different question: the evolution of the optimal reaction norm slope in a variable environment.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, only Option A provides a protocol that correctly isolates selection on the cost of plasticity from other sources of selection on the reaction norm, and its predictions are consistent with the provided model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2717228"}]}
