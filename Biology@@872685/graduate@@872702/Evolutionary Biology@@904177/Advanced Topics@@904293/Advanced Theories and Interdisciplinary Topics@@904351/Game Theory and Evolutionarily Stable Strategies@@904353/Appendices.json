The expected payoff for an individual playing pure strategy $S_{1}$ in this population is given by:\n$$E(S_{1}, p) = p \\cdot A_{11} + (1-p) \\cdot A_{12} = p(2) + (1-p)(1) = 2p + 1 - p = p + 1$$\nSimilarly, the expected payoff for an individual playing pure strategy $S_{2}$ is:\n$$E(S_{2}, p) = p \\cdot A_{21} + (1-p) \\cdot A_{22} = p(3) + (1-p)(0) = 3p$$\n\n**1. Determination of Symmetric Nash Equilibria**\n\nA symmetric Nash equilibrium can be either a pure strategy or a mixed strategy.\n\n- **Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria**:\n  - Consider the pure strategy $p=1$ (population consists entirely of $S_{1}$ strategists). For this to be a NE, an $S_{1}$ player must do at least as well as any mutant, including an $S_{2}$ player. This requires $E(S_{1}, 1) \\ge E(S_{2}, 1)$.\n    We calculate:\n    $E(S_{1}, 1) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    $E(S_{2}, 1) = 3(1) = 3$.\n    Since $E(S_{1}, 1)  E(S_{2}, 1)$ (as $2  3$), a mutant $S_{2}$ strategist would achieve a higher payoff and could invade the population. Thus, $p=1$ is not a symmetric NE.\n  - Consider the pure strategy $p=0$ (population consists entirely of $S_{2}$ strategists). This is a NE if $E(S_{2}, 0) \\ge E(S_{1}, 0)$.\n    We calculate:\n    $E(S_{2}, 0) = 3(0) = 0$.\n    $E(S_{1}, 0) = 0 + 1 = 1$.\n    Since $E(S_{2}, 0)  E(S_{1}, 0)$ (as $0  1$), a mutant $S_{1}$ strategist would invade. Thus, $p=0$ is not a symmetric NE.\n\n- **Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium**:\n  A mixed strategy NE, denoted by $p^{\\ast} \\in (0,1)$, exists if the pure strategies comprising the mix yield equal payoffs. An individual must be indifferent to playing $S_{1}$ or $S_{2}$. This condition is $E(S_{1}, p^{\\ast}) = E(S_{2}, p^{\\ast})$.\n  $$p^{\\ast} + 1 = 3p^{\\ast}$$\n  $$1 = 2p^{\\ast}$$\n  $$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n  The only symmetric Nash equilibrium is the mixed strategy where the frequency of $S_{1}$ is $p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n**2. Evaluation for Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS)**\n\nWe now test if the unique symmetric NE, $p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$, is an ESS. We use the provided definition. Let $p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$ be the resident strategy and $q \\in [0,1]$ with $q \\neq p^{\\ast}$ be the mutant strategy.\n\nThe general payoff function $\\pi(p, q)$, representing the payoff to a $p$-strategist against a $q$-strategist, is:\n$$\\pi(p, q) = p \\cdot (q A_{11} + (1-q) A_{12}) + (1-p) \\cdot (q A_{21} + (1-q) A_{22})$$\n$$\\pi(p, q) = p(2q + 1(1-q)) + (1-p)(3q + 0(1-q)) = p(q+1) + (1-p)(3q) = pq + p + 3q - 3pq$$\n$$\\pi(p, q) = p + 3q - 2pq$$\n\nNow we check the two conditions for ESS for $p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n- **Condition 1: Resident Condition**\n  We must have $\\pi(p^{\\ast}, p^{\\ast}) \\ge \\pi(q, p^{\\ast})$ for all $q$.\n  The payoff to a mutant $q$-strategist in a population of $p^{\\ast}$-strategists is:\n  $$\\pi(q, p^{\\ast}) = \\pi(q, \\frac{1}{2}) = q + 3(\\frac{1}{2}) - 2q(\\frac{1}{2}) = q + \\frac{3}{2} - q = \\frac{3}{2}$$\n  The payoff to a resident $p^{\\ast}$-strategist against its own kind is:\n  $$\\pi(p^{\\ast}, p^{\\ast}) = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} + 3(\\frac{1}{2}) - 2(\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$$\n  Since $\\pi(p^{\\ast}, p^{\\ast}) = \\frac{3}{2}$ and $\\pi(q, p^{\\ast}) = \\frac{3}{2}$ for all $q$, the condition holds with equality: $\\pi(p^{\\ast}, p^{\\ast}) = \\pi(q, p^{\\ast})$.\n\n- **Condition 2: Stability-Against-Invasion Condition**\n  Since the first condition holds with equality, we must verify the second condition: $\\pi(p^{\\ast}, q) > \\pi(q, q)$ for all $q \\neq p^{\\ast}$.\n  We have $p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$. We must check if $\\pi(\\frac{1}{2}, q) > \\pi(q, q)$ for $q \\neq \\frac{1}{2}$.\n  Let's compute the two terms:\n  $$\\pi(p^{\\ast}, q) = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2}, q) = \\frac{1}{2} + 3q - 2(\\frac{1}{2})q = \\frac{1}{2} + 2q$$\n  $$\\pi(q, q) = q + 3q - 2q^{2} = 4q - 2q^{2}$$\n  The inequality is:\n  $$\\frac{1}{2} + 2q > 4q - 2q^{2}$$\n  Rearranging the terms to one side:\n  $$2q^{2} - 2q + \\frac{1}{2} > 0$$\n  Multiplying by $2$:\n  $$4q^{2} - 4q + 1 > 0$$\n  The left-hand side is a perfect square:\n  $$(2q - 1)^{2} > 0$$\n  This inequality is true for all real numbers $q$ except where $2q - 1 = 0$, i.e., $q = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since the condition is for alternative strategies $q \\neq p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$, the strict inequality holds for all relevant $q$.\n\nBoth conditions for an ESS are satisfied for $p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTherefore, the mixed strategy where the frequency of $S_{1}$ is $p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$ is the unique symmetric evolutionarily stable strategy for this game.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "2715334"}, {"introduction": "A common point of confusion is the distinction between a Nash Equilibrium (NE) and an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS).

(NE Condition) $u(A,A) \\ge u(y,A)$ for all strategies $y$.\n2.  (Stability Condition) For any strategy $y \\ne A$ such that $u(A,A) = u(y,A)$, it must hold that $u(A,y)  u(y,y)$.\n\nThe problem states that $A$ is a NE, but not an ESS. The specific reason for the failure of the ESS property is a violation of the second condition. That is, there exists a mutant strategy $y$ such that:\n(a) $u(y,A) = u(A,A)$ (the \"tie\" condition, making $y$ a neutral mutant)\n(b) $u(y,y)  u(A,y)$ (the \"invasion\" condition, which is the negation of the ESS stability condition)\n\nThe mutant $y$ is specified to be either a pure strategy from $\\{B,C\\}$ or a mixed strategy over $\\{B,C\\}$. Let us denote such a mutant by $y = pB + (1-p)C$ for some $p \\in [0,1]$.\n\nLet us begin by applying the NE condition for $x=A$.
