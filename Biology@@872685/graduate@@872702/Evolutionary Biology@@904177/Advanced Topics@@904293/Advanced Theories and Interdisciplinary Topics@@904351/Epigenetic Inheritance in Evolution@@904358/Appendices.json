In sexually reproducing organisms, many such marks undergo partial erasure during germline reprogramming and early embryogenesis, which introduces a per-generation probability that a previously established mark is reset. Consider an epigenetic mark that is present in generation $0$ and is subject to germline reprogramming each generation. Assume the following biologically grounded and widely used modeling assumptions: (i) there is a constant, generation-independent resetting probability $r$ with $0 \\leq r \\leq 1$ per generation; (ii) resetting events in different generations are independent; and (iii) once a mark is reset in a lineage, it is not re-established in subsequent generations under the conditions considered, so that the reset state is absorbing for the lineage.

Provide only the final expression as your answer.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. We shall proceed with the formal derivation.\n\nLet the state of the epigenetic mark in a given lineage at generation $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$ be denoted by the random variable $X_k$. We define two states: state $1$, where the mark is present, and state $0$, where the mark has been reset. The problem states that at generation $g=0$, the mark is present. This gives the initial condition $P(X_0 = 1) = 1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that the mark persists through $g$ generations. Let this event be denoted by $A_g$. This event is equivalent to the condition that the mark has not been reset in any of the $g$ generational transmissions that have occurred since generation $0$. Mathematically, this means the lineage remains in state $1$ for all generations from $k=1$ to $k=g$, conditional on starting in state $1$ at $k=0$. The quantity to be derived is $P(A_g) = P(X_1=1, X_2=1, \\dots, X_g=1 | X_0=1)$.\n\nThe dynamics of this process are specified by the following rules:\n1. The probability of the mark being reset in any single generational transmission is a constant, $r$. This is the probability of transitioning from state $1$ to state $0$: $P(X_k = 0 | X_{k-1} = 1) = r$.\n2. Consequently, the probability that the mark persists (is not reset) through a single generation is the complement: $P(X_k = 1 | X_{k-1} = 1) = 1-r$.\n3. The resetting events in different generations are independent.\n4. The reset state is absorbing. Once the mark is reset, it remains reset for all subsequent generations: $P(X_k = 0 | X_{k-1} = 0) = 1$. This implies $P(X_k = 1 | X_{k-1} = 0) = 0$.\n\nThis process can be conceptualized as a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. Each generational transmission is a trial. A \"success\" for the trial corresponding to the transition from generation $k-1$ to $k$ is the event that the mark persists, i.e., $X_k=1$ given $X_{k-1}=1$. The probability of this success is $p = 1-r$. The event $A_g$, that the mark persists through $g$ generations, corresponds to an uninterrupted sequence of $g$ successes.\n\nGiven the independence of events across generations (rule 3), the probability of the joint event $A_g$ is the product of the probabilities of the individual events.\n$$P(A_g) = P(X_1=1, X_2=1, \\dots, X_g=1 | X_0=1)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability and the Markov property (the state at generation $k$ depends only on the state at $k-1$), we can write this as:\n$$P(A_g) = P(X_1=1|X_0=1) \\times P(X_2=1|X_1=1, X_0=1) \\times \\dots \\times P(X_g=1|X_{g-1}=1, \\dots, X_0=1)$$\n$$P(A_g) = P(X_1=1|X_0=1) \\times P(X_2=1|X_1=1) \\times \\dots \\times P(X_g=1|X_{g-1}=1)$$\nEach term in this product represents the probability of persistence through a single generation, which is $1-r$.\n$$P(A_g) = \\underbrace{(1-r) \\times (1-r) \\times \\dots \\times (1-r)}_{g \\text{ terms}}$$\nThis product simplifies to:\n$$P(A_g) = (1-r)^{g}$$\n\nAlternatively, we can model the system as a discrete-time absorbing Markov process. The state space is $S = \\{1, 0\\}$, corresponding to the mark being \"Present\" or \"Reset\". The one-step transition probability matrix $T$, with states ordered $(1, 0)$, is:\n$$T = \\begin{pmatrix} P(X_k=1|X_{k-1}=1)  P(X_k=0|X_{k-1}=1) \\\\ P(X_k=1|X_{k-1}=0)  P(X_k=0|X_{k-1}=0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1-r  r \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe probability of the mark persisting through $g$ generations is the probability of beginning in state $1$ and remaining in state $1$ after $g$ steps. This is given by the $(1,1)$ entry of the $g$-step transition matrix, $T^g$.\nWe can see by inspection or prove by induction that:\n$$T^g = \\begin{pmatrix} (1-r)^{g}  1-(1-r)^{g} \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe probability we seek is the top-left element of this matrix, $T^g_{11}$, which is the probability $P(X_g = 1 | X_0 = 1)$.\nThis confirms the result from the Bernoulli trial analysis.

The derivation must be based on foundational principles of quantitative genetics.\n\nThe response to selection, $R$, is defined as the change in the mean phenotypic value of the population from one generation to the next:\n$$R = \\Delta \\bar{z} = \\bar{z}_{\\text{offspring}} - \\bar{z}_{\\text{parent}}$$\nwhere $\\bar{z}_{\\text{parent}}$ is the mean phenotype of the parental generation and $\\bar{z}_{\\text{offspring}}$ is the mean phenotype of the offspring generation.

The response to selection is then simply $R = \\bar{z}_{\\text{offspring}}$.\n\nThe mean phenotype in the offspring generation is the population-wide average of the expected phenotypes of offspring from each parent in the preceding generation. The expectation must account for the fitness of each parent, as more fit parents contribute more offspring to the next generation. The mean phenotype of the offspring generation is given by:\n$$\\bar{z}_{\\text{offspring}} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}_{\\text{parents}}[w \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[z_{\\text{offspring}} \\mid \\text{parent}]]}{\\mathbb{E}_{\\text{parents}}[w]}$$\nThe problem states that relative fitness $w$ is scaled such that the population mean fitness $\\bar{w} = \\mathbb{E}_{\\text{parents}}[w] = 1$. The denominator is therefore $1$.\n\nNext, we identify the expected phenotype of an offspring given its parent's state. The phenotype is $z = A + M + E$. Using the provided transmission rules for uniparental reproduction:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[z_{\\text{offspring}} \\mid \\text{parent}] = \\mathbb{E}[A_{\\text{offspring}} + M_{\\text{offspring}} + E_{\\text{offspring}} \\mid \\text{parent}]$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}[z_{\\text{offspring}} \\mid \\text{parent}] = \\mathbb{E}[A_{\\text{offspring}} \\mid \\text{parent}] + \\mathbb{E}[M_{\\text{offspring}} \\mid \\text{parent}] + \\mathbb{E}[E_{\\text{offspring}} \\mid \\text{parent}]$$\nSubstituting the given expectations:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[z_{\\text{offspring}} \\mid \\text{parent}] = A + \\tau M + 0 = A + \\tau M$$\nThis quantity, $A + \\tau M$, represents the total heritable value of the trait for a given parent.

Using the definition of covariance, $\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = \\mathbb{E}[XY] - \\mathbb{E}[X]\\mathbb{E}[Y]$, and with $\\bar{w}=1$ and $\\bar{z}_{BV}=0$, the expression for $R$ is equivalent to the covariance between fitness and the generalized breeding value:\n$$R = \\operatorname{Cov}(w, A + \\tau M)$$\nThis is an application of the Robertson-Price identity, which states that the evolutionary response of a trait is equal to the covariance of fitness with its breeding value.\n\nThe problem states that selection acts via a linear fitness function: $w = \\alpha + \\beta z + \\varepsilon$, where $\\beta$ is the selection gradient and $\\varepsilon$ is an error term uncorrelated with $z$. We substitute this into the expression for $R$:\n$$R = \\operatorname{Cov}(\\alpha + \\beta z + \\varepsilon, A + \\tau M)$$\nUsing the properties of covariance, and noting that $\\alpha$ is a constant and $\\varepsilon$ is uncorrelated with $A$ and $M$ (as they are components of $z$ with which $\\varepsilon$ is uncorrelated), this simplifies to:\n$$R = \\beta \\operatorname{Cov}(z, A + \\tau M)$$\nTo proceed, we must relate the selection gradient $\\beta$ to the selection differential $S$. The selection differential is defined as $S = \\operatorname{Cov}(w, z)$.

Therefore, $\\operatorname{Cov}(A, M) = 0$, $\\operatorname{Cov}(E, A) = 0$, and $\\operatorname{Cov}(E, M) = 0$.
