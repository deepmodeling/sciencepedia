It is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and contains all necessary information for its resolution. I will therefore proceed with the derivation as requested.\n\nThe task is to derive the one-generation recursion for the frequency of an allele $A$, denoted by $p$, under the influence of deterministic viability selection. This will be done for both a haploid and a diploid population.\n\nPart (a): Haploid Case\n\nIn a haploid population, individuals carry a single copy of the gene. Let the frequency of individuals carrying allele $A$ be $p$ and the frequency of individuals carrying allele $a$ be $q$, where $q = 1-p$. Let the total population size before selection be $N$. The number of individuals of type $A$ is $N_A = Np$ and the number of individuals of type $a$ is $N_a = Nq$.\n\nThe absolute fitnesses are given as $w_A$ and $w_a$. Absolute fitness is a multiplier representing the expected number of offspring an individual contributes to the next generation. After viability selection, the expected numbers of individuals of each type are:\n$$ N'_A = N_A w_A = N p w_A $$\n$$ N'_a = N_a w_a = N q w_a $$\nThe total population size after selection, $N'$, is the sum of these quantities:\n$$ N' = N'_A + N'_a = N p w_A + N q w_a = N(p w_A + q w_a) $$\nThe term $\\bar{w} = p w_A + q w_a$ is the mean absolute fitness of the haploid population. It represents the average fitness across all individuals. Thus, $N' = N \\bar{w}$.\n\nThe frequency of allele $A$ in the next generation, $p'$, is the number of $A$ individuals after selection divided by the total number of individuals after selection.\n$$ p' = \\frac{N'_A}{N'} = \\frac{N p w_A}{N(p w_A + q w_a)} $$\nThe initial population size $N$ cancels, as expected in a deterministic model where only relative frequencies matter for the dynamics. This leaves the recursion:\n$$ p' = \\frac{p w_A}{p w_A + q w_a} = \\frac{p w_A}{\\bar{w}} $$\nThis equation describes the change in the frequency of allele $A$ over one generation of selection in a haploid population.\n\nPart (b): Diploid Case\n\nIn a diploid population with random mating, the frequencies of genotypes among zygotes are given by the Hardy–Weinberg proportions:\n-   Frequency of $AA$: $f(AA) = p^2$\n-   Frequency of $Aa$: $f(Aa) = 2pq$\n-   Frequency of $aa$: $f(aa) = q^2$\nThese frequencies sum to $p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = (p+q)^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n\nSelection acts on the viability of these zygotes. The absolute viabilities are $w_{AA}$, $w_{Aa}$, and $w_{aa}$ for genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$, respectively. The frequencies of the genotypes after selection but before normalization are proportional to their initial frequencies multiplied by their fitnesses:\n-   Proportion of $AA$ survivors $\\propto p^2 w_{AA}$\n-   Proportion of $Aa$ survivors $\\propto 2pq w_{Aa}$\n-   Proportion of $aa$ survivors $\\propto q^2 w_{aa}$\n\nTo obtain the true frequencies of the genotypes among the adult survivors, we must normalize by dividing by the sum of these proportions. This sum is the mean absolute fitness of the diploid population, $\\bar{w}$:\n$$ \\bar{w} = p^2 w_{AA} + 2pq w_{Aa} + q^2 w_{aa} $$\nThe post-selection genotype frequencies are therefore:\n$$ P'_{AA} = \\frac{p^2 w_{AA}}{\\bar{w}} $$\n$$ P'_{Aa} = \\frac{2pq w_{Aa}}{\\bar{w}} $$\n$$ P'_{aa} = \\frac{q^2 w_{aa}}{\\bar{w}} $$\nThe new frequency of allele $A$, denoted $p'$, is the frequency of this allele in the gene pool of the surviving adults. In a diploid organism, each $AA$ individual carries two $A$ alleles and each $Aa$ individual carries one $A$ allele. Thus, $p'$ is the frequency of $AA$ individuals plus half the frequency of $Aa$ individuals:\n$$ p' = P'_{AA} + \\frac{1}{2} P'_{Aa} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the post-selection genotype frequencies:\n$$ p' = \\frac{p^2 w_{AA}}{\\bar{w}} + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2pq w_{Aa}}{\\bar{w}} \\right) = \\frac{p^2 w_{AA} + pq w_{Aa}}{\\bar{w}} $$\nThis is the fundamental one-generation recursion for allele frequency under viability selection in a diploid population.\n\nNow, we must rewrite this expression in terms of allele-specific marginal fitnesses, $\\bar{w}_A$ and $\\bar{w}_a$. The marginal fitness of an allele is the average fitness of all genotypes in which it occurs, weighted by the frequency of the other allele it is paired with. For allele $A$, it can be paired with another $A$ (from a gamete with frequency $p$) to form $AA$, or with an $a$ (from a gamete with frequency $q$) to form $Aa$. Therefore, the marginal fitness of allele $A$ is:\n$$ \\bar{w}_A = p w_{AA} + q w_{Aa} $$\nSimilarly, for allele $a$:\n$$ \\bar{w}_a = p w_{Aa} + q w_{aa} $$\nLet us now examine the numerator of our expression for $p'$:\n$$ p^2 w_{AA} + pq w_{Aa} = p(p w_{AA} + q w_{Aa}) $$\nThe term in the parenthesis is precisely the definition of the marginal fitness $\\bar{w}_A$. So, the numerator is $p \\bar{w}_A$.\n\nNext, we examine the denominator, which is the mean fitness $\\bar{w}$. We can show that it is a weighted average of the marginal fitnesses:\n$$ p \\bar{w}_A + q \\bar{w}_a = p(p w_{AA} + q w_{Aa}) + q(p w_{Aa} + q w_{aa}) $$\n$$ = p^2 w_{AA} + pq w_{Aa} + qp w_{Aa} + q^2 w_{aa} $$\n$$ = p^2 w_{AA} + 2pq w_{Aa} + q^2 w_{aa} = \\bar{w} $$\nTherefore, the mean fitness can be expressed as $\\bar{w} = p \\bar{w}_A + q \\bar{w}_a$.\n\nSubstituting these new forms for the numerator and denominator into the diploid recursion for $p'$ gives:\n$$ p' = \\frac{p \\bar{w}_A}{p \\bar{w}_A + q \\bar{w}_a} $$\nThis expression is formally identical to the haploid recursion $p' = \\frac{p w_A}{p w_A + q w_a}$, with the haploid fitnesses $w_A$ and $w_a$ being replaced by the diploid marginal fitnesses $\\bar{w}_A$ and $\\bar{w}_a$. This is a profound result, demonstrating that the dynamics of gene frequency change can be described by focusing on the average fitness effects of the alleles themselves, even within the more complex context of diploid genetics. The final requested expression is for $p'$ in terms of $p$, $q$, $\\bar{w}_A$, and $\\bar{w}_a$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{p' = \\frac{p \\bar{w}_A}{p \\bar{w}_A + q \\bar{w}_a}}$$", "id": "2700654"}, {"introduction": "With the general selection recursion in hand, we can now explore specific evolutionary scenarios.

The model, while a simplification, is a standard and valid framework for studying selection. No flaws are identified. The problem is valid.\n\nWe now proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $p$ be the frequency of allele $A$ and $q=1-p$ be the frequency of allele $a$ in a given generation. In a large, randomly mating population, the genotypes of the zygotes will be in Hardy–Weinberg proportions:\n- Frequency of $AA$ zygotes = $p^2$\n- Frequency of $Aa$ zygotes = $2pq$\n- Frequency of $aa$ zygotes = $q^2$\n\nViability selection acts on these zygotes before they reach adulthood. The relative proportions of the genotypes that survive to reproductive age are weighted by their respective viabilities:\n- Proportion of $AA$ adults $\\propto p^2 w_{AA}$\n- Proportion of $Aa$ adults $\\propto 2pq w_{Aa}$\n- Proportion of $aa$ adults $\\propto q^2 w_{aa}$\n\nThe sum of these proportions is the mean fitness of the population, denoted by $\\bar{w}$. This serves as the normalization factor to convert these proportions into frequencies.\n$$ \\bar{w} = p^2 w_{AA} + 2pq w_{Aa} + q^2 w_{aa} $$\nThe frequencies of the genotypes among the surviving adults are therefore:\n- Frequency of $AA$ adults = $\\frac{p^2 w_{AA}}{\\bar{w}}$\n- Frequency of $Aa$ adults = $\\frac{2pq w_{Aa}}{\\bar{w}}$\n- Frequency of $aa$ adults = $\\frac{q^2 w_{aa}}{\\bar{w}}$\n\nThe allele frequency of $A$ in the next generation, $p'$, is the frequency of $A$ alleles in this pool of surviving adults. Each $AA$ individual carries two $A$ alleles, and each $Aa$ individual carries one. Thus, $p'$ is the frequency of $AA$ adults plus half the frequency of $Aa$ adults.\n$$ p' = \\frac{p^2 w_{AA}}{\\bar{w}} + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{2pq w_{Aa}}{\\bar{w}}\\right) $$\n$$ p' = \\frac{p^2 w_{AA} + pq w_{Aa}}{\\bar{w}} $$\nFactoring out $p$ from the numerator gives the recurrence relation:\n$$ p' = \\frac{p(p w_{AA} + q w_{Aa})}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{p(p w_{AA} + (1-p) w_{Aa})}{p^2 w_{AA} + 2p(1-p) w_{Aa} + (1-p)^2 w_{aa}} $$\nThis is the deterministic recurrence for the allele $A$ frequency.\n\nNext, we find the internal equilibrium frequency, $p^*$, where $0  p^*  1$. This is a fixed point of the recurrence, meaning $p' = p^*$. We set $p' = p$ in the equation:\n$$ p = \\frac{p(p w_{AA} + q w_{Aa})}{\\bar{w}} $$\nThis equation has trivial solutions $p=0$ and $p=1$. For the internal equilibrium, we assume $p \\neq 0$ and divide both sides by $p$:\n$$ 1 = \\frac{p w_{AA} + q w_{Aa}}{\\bar{w}} $$\n$$ \\bar{w} = p w_{AA} + q w_{Aa} $$\nThe term $p w_{AA} + q w_{Aa}$ is the marginal fitness of allele $A$, denoted $\\bar{w}_A$. The equilibrium condition is $\\bar{w} = \\bar{w}_A$. We also know that $\\bar{w} = p \\bar{w}_A + q \\bar{w}_a$, where $\\bar{w}_a = p w_{Aa} + q w_{aa}$ is the marginal fitness of allele $a$. Substituting $\\bar{w} = \\bar{w}_A$ into the definition of $\\bar{w}$ gives $p \\bar{w}_A + q \\bar{w}_a = \\bar{w}_A$, which simplifies to $q(\\bar{w}_a - \\bar{w}_A) = 0$. Since we are looking for an internal equilibrium where $q \\neq 0$, this requires $\\bar{w}_A = \\bar{w}_a$.\n$$ p w_{AA} + q w_{Aa} = p w_{Aa} + q w_{aa} $$\nSubstituting $q=1-p$:\n$$ p w_{AA} + (1-p) w_{Aa} = p w_{Aa} + (1-p) w_{aa} $$\n$$ p w_{AA} + w_{Aa} - p w_{Aa} = p w_{Aa} + w_{aa} - p w_{aa} $$\nWe gather terms containing $p$ on one side:\n$$ p(w_{AA} - w_{Aa} - w_{Aa} + w_{aa}) = w_{aa} - w_{Aa} $$\n$$ p(w_{AA} - 2w_{Aa} + w_{aa}) = w_{aa} - w_{Aa} $$\nSolving for the equilibrium frequency $p^*$:\n$$ p^* = \\frac{w_{aa} - w_{Aa}}{w_{AA} - 2w_{Aa} + w_{aa}} $$\n\nNow, we specialize to the case of underdominance (heterozygote disadvantage) with $w_{AA}=1$, $w_{Aa}=0.8$, and $w_{aa}=0.9$.

Thus, the sign of $\\Delta p$ is determined by the sign of $\\bar{w}_A - \\bar{w}_a$.\nFrom our derivation of $p^*$, we found that $\\bar{w}_A - \\bar{w}_a = p(w_{AA} - 2w_{Aa} + w_{aa}) - (w_{aa} - w_{Aa})$.\nRecognizing that $p^* = \\frac{w_{aa} - w_{Aa}}{w_{AA} - 2w_{Aa} + w_{aa}}$, we can write:\n$$ \\bar{w}_A - \\bar{w}_a = (p - p^*)(w_{AA} - 2w_{Aa} + w_{aa}) $$\nSo, the change in allele frequency is:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{pq}{\\bar{w}}(p - p^*)(w_{AA} - 2w_{Aa} + w_{aa}) $$\nFor our specific values, the term $(w_{AA} - 2w_{Aa} + w_{aa})$ is $1 - 2(0.8) + 0.9 = 0.3$, which is positive.\nTherefore, the sign of $\\Delta p$ is the same as the sign of $(p - p^*)$.\n- If $p  p^*$, then $p - p^*  0$, so $\\Delta p  0$. The allele frequency $p$ will increase, moving further away from $p^*$.\n- If $p  p^*$, then $p - p^*  0$, so $\\Delta p  0$. The allele frequency $p$ will decrease, moving further away from $p^*$.\nThis behavior, where allele frequencies are repelled from the equilibrium point, defines a locally unstable equilibrium.\n\nThe long-term fate of the alleles depends on the initial frequency $p_0$ relative to the unstable equilibrium $p^* = 1/3$.\n- If the initial frequency $p_0  1/3$, selection will continuously increase the frequency of allele $A$, leading to its fixation ($p \\to 1$).\n- If the initial frequency $p_0  1/3$, selection will continuously decrease the frequency of allele $A$, leading to its loss and the fixation of allele $a$ ($p \\to 0$).\n- If $p_0 = 1/3$, the population remains at the unstable equilibrium, but any perturbation would drive it to one of the fixation states.\nThus, the unstable equilibrium acts as a threshold, determining which of the two homozygous genotypes will ultimately dominate the population.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.3333}\n$$", "id": "2700643"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to the disruptive nature of underdominance, overdominance (heterozygote advantage) provides a classic mechanism for maintaining genetic diversity within a population.

For the internal equilibrium, where $p^{\\ast} \\neq 0$, we can divide by $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\overline{w} = p^{\\ast} w_{AA} + (1-p^{\\ast}) w_{Aa}\n$$\nNow, substitute the definition of the mean fitness $\\overline{w} = (p^{\\ast})^{2} w_{AA} + 2p^{\\ast}(1-p^{\\ast}) w_{Aa} + (1-p^{\\ast})^{2} w_{aa}$:\n$$\n(p^{\\ast})^{2} w_{AA} + 2p^{\\ast}(1-p^{\\ast}) w_{Aa} + (1-p^{\\ast})^{2} w_{aa} = p^{\\ast} w_{AA} + (1-p^{\\ast}) w_{Aa}\n$$\nRearranging the terms to find the non-trivial solution:\n$$\n(p^{\\ast})^{2} w_{AA} - p^{\\ast} w_{AA} + 2p^{\\ast}(1-p^{\\ast}) w_{Aa} - (1-p^{\\ast}) w_{Aa} + (1-p^{\\ast})^{2} w_{aa} = 0\n$$\nFactoring terms:\n$$\np^{\\ast}(p^{\\ast}-1) w_{AA} + (1-p^{\\ast})(2p^{\\ast}-1) w_{Aa} + (1-p^{\\ast})^{2} w_{aa} = 0\n$$\nFactor out $(1-p^{\\ast})$ (since for an internal equilibrium, $p^{\\ast} \\neq 1$):\n$$\n-p^{\\ast} w_{AA} + (2p^{\\ast}-1) w_{Aa} + (1-p^{\\ast}) w_{aa} = 0\n$$\nNow, substitute the given fitness values: $w_{AA} = 1 - s$, $w_{Aa} = 1$, and $w_{aa} = 1 - t$.\n$$\n-p^{\\ast}(1-s) + (2p^{\\ast}-1)(1) + (1-p^{\\ast})(1-t) = 0\n$$\nExpand the expression:\n$$\n-p^{\\ast} + p^{\\ast}s + 2p^{\\ast} - 1 + 1 - p^{\\ast} - t + p^{\\ast}t = 0\n$$\nGroup the terms containing $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$\np^{\\ast}(-1 + s + 2 - 1 + t) - t = 0\n$$\n$$\np^{\\ast}(s+t) - t = 0\n$$\nSolving for $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$\np^{\\ast} = \\frac{t}{s+t}\n$$\nSince $s0$ and $t0$, it is guaranteed that $0  t  s+t$, so $p^{\\ast} \\in (0,1)$, confirming it is a valid internal polymorphic equilibrium.\n\n### Computation of the Derivative\nThe equilibrium frequency $p^{\\ast}$ is a function of $s$ and $t$. We are given that $s$ and $t$ are themselves functions of a parameter $\\varepsilon$.\n$$\np^{\\ast}(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{t(\\varepsilon)}{s(\\varepsilon) + t(\\varepsilon)}\n$$\nwhere $s(\\varepsilon) = s_{0} + a\\varepsilon$ and $t(\\varepsilon) = t_{0} + b\\varepsilon$.\nWe use the chain rule for multivariate functions to find the derivative of $p^{\\ast}$ with respect to $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\n\\frac{d p^{\\ast}}{d\\varepsilon} = \\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial s} \\frac{ds}{d\\varepsilon} + \\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial t} \\frac{dt}{d\\varepsilon}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the partial derivatives of $p^{\\ast}(s,t) = \\frac{t}{s+t}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial s} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} \\left( t(s+t)^{-1} \\right) = t \\cdot (-1)(s+t)^{-2} \\cdot 1 = -\\frac{t}{(s+t)^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left( \\frac{t}{s+t} \\right) = \\frac{1 \\cdot (s+t) - t \\cdot 1}{(s+t)^{2}} = \\frac{s}{(s+t)^{2}}\n$$\nNext, we compute the derivatives of $s(\\varepsilon)$ and $t(\\varepsilon)$:\n$$\n\\frac{ds}{d\\varepsilon} = \\frac{d}{d\\varepsilon}(s_{0} + a\\varepsilon) = a\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dt}{d\\varepsilon} = \\frac{d}{d\\varepsilon}(t_{0} + b\\varepsilon) = b\n$$\nSubstituting these components into the chain rule expression:\n$$\n\\frac{d p^{\\ast}}{d\\varepsilon} = \\left(-\\frac{t}{(s+t)^{2}}\\right) a + \\left(\\frac{s}{(s+t)^{2}}\\right) b = \\frac{bs - at}{(s+t)^{2}}\n$$\nThe problem requires this derivative to be evaluated at $\\varepsilon = 0$. At this point, $s = s(\\text{0}) = s_{0}$ and $t = t(\\text{0}) = t_{0}$.\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d p^{\\ast}}{d\\varepsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon=0} = \\frac{b s_{0} - a t_{0}}{(s_{0} + t_{0})^{2}}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the required derivative.\n\n### Biological Interpretation\nThe sign of the derivative $\\left.\\dfrac{d p^{\\ast}}{d\\varepsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon=0}$ indicates the direction of the initial change in the equilibrium frequency of allele $A$ as the fitness landscape is perturbed by $\\varepsilon$. The denominator, $(s_0 + t_0)^2$, is strictly positive. Therefore, the sign is determined entirely by the numerator, $b s_{0} - a t_{0}$.\n\n- If $b s_{0} - a t_{0}  0$, then $\\left.\\dfrac{d p^{\\ast}}{d\\varepsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon=0}  0$, and the equilibrium frequency of allele $A$, $p^{\\ast}$, increases for small positive $\\varepsilon$.\n- If $b s_{0} - a t_{0}  0$, then $\\left.\\dfrac{d p^{\\ast}}{d\\varepsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon=0}  0$, and $p^{\\ast}$ decreases.\n\nThe terms have direct biological meaning. The parameter $a = ds/d\\varepsilon$ quantifies how rapidly the selective disadvantage of the $AA$ homozygote changes, while $b = dt/d\\varepsilon$ quantifies the same for the $aa$ homozygote. An increase in $s$ disfavors allele $A$, while an increase in $t$ favors allele $A$. The expression $b s_{0} - a t_{0}$ represents the net effect of these two competing pressures. The equilibrium frequency of allele $A$ increases ($p^{\\ast} \\uparrow$) if the effect of increasing the disadvantage of $aa$ (term $b s_0$) outweighs the effect of increasing the disadvantage of $AA$ (term $a t_0$). The initial selection coefficients $s_0$ and $t_0$ act as weights in this balance, modulating the impact of the changes $a$ and $b$. In essence, the equilibrium shifts to favor the allele whose homozygous fitness cost is increasing at a relatively lower rate, as determined by the weighted comparison $b s_0$ versus $a t_0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{b s_{0} - a t_{0}}{(s_{0} + t_{0})^{2}}}$$", "id": "2700724"}]}
