From $n$ randomly sampled individuals, you observe genotype counts $(n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa})$ with $n_{AA} + n_{Aa} + n_{aa} = n$. Let $p$ denote the population frequency of allele $A$. Using only the following foundational base: the multinomial sampling model for genotype counts, the definition of allele frequency as a function of genotype probabilities, and the Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) principle under its standard assumptions (random mating, no selection, no mutation, no migration, and effectively infinite population size), derive the maximum likelihood estimator for $p$ in two ways.\n\n1) First, treat the genotype probabilities as free parameters $\\theta_{AA}, \\theta_{Aa}, \\theta_{aa}$ subject only to the constraints $\\theta_{AA} \\ge 0$, $\\theta_{Aa} \\ge 0$, $\\theta_{aa} \\ge 0$, and $\\theta_{AA} + \\theta_{Aa} + \\theta_{aa} = 1$, while defining $p$ as the induced allele frequency $p = \\theta_{AA} + \\frac{1}{2}\\theta_{Aa}$.

The observed data are the counts of genotypes $(n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa})$ from a sample of $n$ diploid individuals, where $n = n_{AA} + n_{Aa} + n_{aa}$.\n\nThe foundation of this problem is the likelihood function for observing these genotype counts, which follows a multinomial distribution. Let the population probabilities of the genotypes be $(\\theta_{AA}, \\theta_{Aa}, \\theta_{aa})$. The likelihood function $L$ is given by:\n$$ L(\\theta_{AA}, \\theta_{Aa}, \\theta_{aa} | n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa}) = \\frac{n!}{n_{AA}! n_{Aa}! n_{aa}!} \\theta_{AA}^{n_{AA}} \\theta_{Aa}^{n_{Aa}} \\theta_{aa}^{n_{aa}} $$\nFor the purpose of maximization, the constant combinatorial term can be ignored.

The allele frequency $p$ is defined as an induced quantity: $p = \\theta_{AA} + \\frac{1}{2}\\theta_{Aa}$.\n\nTo find the MLEs for $(\\theta_{AA}, \\theta_{Aa}, \\theta_{aa})$, we maximize the log-likelihood subject to the constraint $\\theta_{AA} + \\theta_{Aa} + \\theta_{aa} = 1$. This is a standard application of the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$ is:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(\\theta_{AA}, \\theta_{Aa}, \\theta_{aa}, \\lambda) = n_{AA}\\ln(\\theta_{AA}) + n_{Aa}\\ln(\\theta_{Aa}) + n_{aa}\\ln(\\theta_{aa}) - \\lambda(\\theta_{AA} + \\theta_{Aa} + \\theta_{aa} - 1) $$\nWe take partial derivatives with respect to each $\\theta_{ij}$ and set them to zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\theta_{AA}} = \\frac{n_{AA}}{\\theta_{AA}} - \\lambda = 0 \\implies \\hat{\\theta}_{AA} = \\frac{n_{AA}}{\\lambda} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\theta_{Aa}} = \\frac{n_{Aa}}{\\theta_{Aa}} - \\lambda = 0 \\implies \\hat{\\theta}_{Aa} = \\frac{n_{Aa}}{\\lambda} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\theta_{aa}} = \\frac{n_{aa}}{\\theta_{aa}} - \\lambda = 0 \\implies \\hat{\\theta}_{aa} = \\frac{n_{aa}}{\\lambda} $$\nTo find the value of the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$, we use the constraint:\n$$ \\hat{\\theta}_{AA} + \\hat{\\theta}_{Aa} + \\hat{\\theta}_{aa} = \\frac{n_{AA}}{\\lambda} + \\frac{n_{Aa}}{\\lambda} + \\frac{n_{aa}}{\\lambda} = 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{n_{AA} + n_{Aa} + n_{aa}}{\\lambda} = \\frac{n}{\\lambda} = 1 \\implies \\lambda = n $$\nSubstituting $\\lambda = n$ back into the expressions for the estimators gives the MLEs for the genotype probabilities:\n$$ \\hat{\\theta}_{AA} = \\frac{n_{AA}}{n}, \\quad \\hat{\\theta}_{Aa} = \\frac{n_{Aa}}{n}, \\quad \\hat{\\theta}_{aa} = \\frac{n_{aa}}{n} $$\nThese are simply the observed sample frequencies of the genotypes.\n\nThe problem asks for the MLE of $p$. By the invariance property of maximum likelihood estimators, the MLE of a function of parameters is that same function applied to the MLEs of the parameters. Therefore, the MLE of $p$, denoted $\\hat{p}$, is:\n$$ \\hat{p} = \\hat{\\theta}_{AA} + \\frac{1}{2}\\hat{\\theta}_{Aa} = \\frac{n_{AA}}{n} + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{n_{Aa}}{n} = \\frac{2n_{AA} + n_{Aa}}{2n} $$\n\n**2) Derivation with Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) Constraint**\n\nIn the second case, we impose the HWE constraint, which models the genotype probabilities as functions of a single parameter, the allele frequency $p$:\n$$ (\\theta_{AA}, \\theta_{Aa}, \\theta_{aa}) = (p^{2}, 2p(1-p), (1-p)^{2}) $$\nWe substitute these into the log-likelihood function, creating a function of $p$ alone:\n$$ \\ell(p) \\propto n_{AA}\\ln(p^{2}) + n_{Aa}\\ln(2p(1-p)) + n_{aa}\\ln((1-p)^{2}) $$\n$$ \\ell(p) = 2n_{AA}\\ln(p) + n_{Aa}(\\ln(2) + \\ln(p) + \\ln(1-p)) + 2n_{aa}\\ln(1-p) $$\n$$ \\ell(p) = (2n_{AA} + n_{Aa})\\ln(p) + (n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa})\\ln(1-p) + n_{Aa}\\ln(2) $$\nTo find the MLE for $p$, we take the derivative of $\\ell(p)$ with respect to $p$ and set it to zero. The constant term $n_{Aa}\\ln(2)$ vanishes upon differentiation.\n$$ \\frac{d\\ell}{dp} = \\frac{2n_{AA} + n_{Aa}}{p} - \\frac{n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa}}{1-p} = 0 $$\nSolving for $p$:\n$$ \\frac{2n_{AA} + n_{Aa}}{p} = \\frac{n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa}}{1-p} $$\n$$ (2n_{AA} + n_{Aa})(1-p) = p(n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa}) $$\n$$ 2n_{AA} + n_{Aa} - p(2n_{AA} + n_{Aa}) = p(n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa}) $$\n$$ 2n_{AA} + n_{Aa} = p(2n_{AA} + n_{Aa} + n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa}) $$\n$$ 2n_{AA} + n_{Aa} = p(2n_{AA} + 2n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa}) $$\nSince $n = n_{AA} + n_{Aa} + n_{aa}$, we have:\n$$ 2n_{AA} + n_{Aa} = p \\cdot 2n $$\nTherefore, the MLE under the HWE constraint is:\n$$ \\hat{p} = \\frac{2n_{AA} + n_{Aa}}{2n} $$\n\n**Explanation of Equivalence**\n\nThe two derivations produce the identical estimator for $p$. This is not a coincidence but follows from the specific algebraic structure of the HWE model.\nThe first derivation finds the MLEs in a general, unconstrained parameter space (a $2$-simplex for the three probabilities). The second derivation restricts the maximization to a $1$-dimensional curved submanifold within this space, defined by the HWE parametric equations $(\\theta_{AA}, \\theta_{Aa}, \\theta_{aa}) = (p^{2}, 2p(1-p), (1-p)^{2})$.\n\nThe fundamental reason for the identity of the estimators is that the HWE parameterization is constructed such that the induced allele frequency is identically equal to the parameter $p$ itself. That is, if we take the HWE genotype frequencies and apply the general definition of allele frequency, we recover $p$:\n$$ \\theta_{AA} + \\frac{1}{2}\\theta_{Aa} = p^{2} + \\frac{1}{2}(2p(1-p)) = p^{2} + p(1-p) = p^{2} + p - p^{2} = p $$\nThis shows that the parameter $p$ in the HWE model has the exact same definition as the quantity we wish to estimate in the first part.\n\nThe score equation (the derivative of the log-likelihood set to zero) for the HWE-constrained model is $\\frac{d\\ell}{dp} = 0$, which we found leads to the condition:\n$$ \\hat{p} = \\frac{2n_{AA} + n_{Aa}}{2n} $$\nIf we substitute the unconstrained MLEs for the genotype frequencies, $\\hat{\\theta}_{ij} = n_{ij}/n$, into the expression for $\\hat{p}$ from the first part, we get:\n$$ \\hat{p} = \\frac{n_{AA}}{n} + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{n_{Aa}}{n} = \\hat{\\theta}_{AA} + \\frac{1}{2}\\hat{\\theta}_{Aa} $$\nCombining these shows that the MLE under HWE, $\\hat{p}$, satisfies $\\hat{p} = \\hat{\\theta}_{AA} + \\frac{1}{2}\\hat{\\theta}_{Aa}$. This means the MLE under the HWE assumption is precisely the allele frequency computed from the observed sample genotype proportions.\n\nIn essence, the \"best-fit\" point on the HWE curve is the one whose parameter $p$ matches the allele frequency calculated from the globally optimal point in the larger, unconstrained space. This is a special property that does not hold for arbitrary reparameterizations. It works here because the HWE model belongs to the exponential family of distributions, and the allele frequency $p$ is a linear function of the natural parameters in the unconstrained model, which here correspond to the genotype frequencies. Maximizing the likelihood, whether in the full parameter space or on the HWE submanifold, identifies the sample allele frequency as the optimal estimate for the population allele frequency. The quantity $2n_{AA} + n_{Aa}$ represents the total count of allele $A$ in the sample, and $2n$ is the total number of allelic copies. The estimator is thus the sample proportion of allele $A$, a result that is both intuitive and mathematically robust under both modeling scenarios.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2n_{AA} + n_{Aa}}{2n}}\n$$", "id": "2721753"}, {"introduction": "Once we have a robust estimate for allele frequencies, the next logical step is to test whether the observed genotype counts in a population align with the predictions of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium model.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a four-step procedure. We will address each in order.\n\nStep 1: Estimation of allele frequencies.\nThe problem states that the population is in Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). For a locus with $k$ alleles $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_k$ with respective population frequencies $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k$, the expected genotype frequencies under HWE are $p_i^2$ for homozygotes $A_iA_i$ and $2p_ip_j$ for heterozygotes $A_iA_j$ (where $i \\neq j$). The data consists of genotype counts $n_{ij}$ from a sample of $N$ individuals. These counts follow a multinomial distribution with probabilities given by the HWE frequencies.\n\nThe likelihood function $L$ for the observed genotype counts $\\{n_{ij}\\}$ given the allele frequencies $\\{p_i\\}$ is proportional to:\n$$L(\\{p_i\\}) \\propto \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{k} (p_i^2)^{n_{ii}} \\right) \\left( \\prod_{i<j} (2p_ip_j)^{n_{ij}} \\right)$$\nTo find the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) for the allele frequencies, we maximize the log-likelihood, $\\ln L$:\n$$\\ln L = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_{ii} \\ln(p_i^2) + \\sum_{i<j} n_{ij} \\ln(2p_ip_j) + C$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant. This simplifies to:\n$$\\ln L = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} 2n_{ii} \\ln(p_i) + \\sum_{i<j} n_{ij}(\\ln(2) + \\ln(p_i) + \\ln(p_j)) + C$$\nRearranging the terms to group by $\\ln(p_i)$:\n$$\\ln L = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\left( 2n_{ii} + \\sum_{j \\neq i} n_{ij} \\right) \\ln(p_i) + C'$$\nThe term $C_i = 2n_{ii} + \\sum_{j \\neq i} n_{ij}$ represents the total count of allele $A_i$ in the sample. The expression to be maximized is $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} C_i \\ln(p_i)$, subject to the constraint $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i = 1$. Using a Lagrange multiplier, it can be shown that the MLE for $p_i$ is given by the proportion of allele $A_i$ in the total allele pool:\n$$\\hat{p}_i = \\frac{C_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^{k} C_j}$$\nThe total number of alleles in a sample of $N$ diploid individuals is $2N$. Therefore, $\\sum_{j=1}^{k} C_j = 2N$, and the MLE is $\\hat{p}_i = \\frac{C_i}{2N}$. This is the \"gene counting\" or \"allele counting\" method.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total sample size $N$ from the given genotype counts:\n$n_{11} = 135$, $n_{22} = 70$, $n_{33} = 29$, $n_{44} = 6$.\n$n_{12} = 180$, $n_{13} = 130$, $n_{14} = 60$, $n_{23} = 105$, $n_{24} = 53$, $n_{34} = 32$.\n$$N = 135 + 70 + 29 + 6 + 180 + 130 + 60 + 105 + 53 + 32 = 800$$\nThe total number of alleles in the sample is $2N = 1600$.\n\nNext, we calculate the counts for each of the $k=4$ alleles:\n$C_1 = 2n_{11} + n_{12} + n_{13} + n_{14} = 2(135) + 180 + 130 + 60 = 270 + 370 = 640$.\n$C_2 = 2n_{22} + n_{12} + n_{23} + n_{24} = 2(70) + 180 + 105 + 53 = 140 + 338 = 478$.\n$C_3 = 2n_{33} + n_{13} + n_{23} + n_{34} = 2(29) + 130 + 105 + 32 = 58 + 267 = 325$.\n$C_4 = 2n_{44} + n_{14} + n_{24} + n_{34} = 2(6) + 60 + 53 + 32 = 12 + 145 = 157$.\nThe sum of allele counts is $640 + 478 + 325 + 157 = 1600$, which confirms our calculation of $2N$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the estimated allele frequencies $\\hat{p}_i$:\n$\\hat{p}_1 = \\frac{640}{1600} = 0.4$.\n$\\hat{p}_2 = \\frac{478}{1600} = 0.29875$.\n$\\hat{p}_3 = \\frac{325}{1600} = 0.203125$.\n$\\hat{p}_4 = \\frac{157}{1600} = 0.098125$.\nThe sum is $\\hat{p}_1 + \\hat{p}_2 + \\hat{p}_3 + \\hat{p}_4 = 0.4 + 0.29875 + 0.203125 + 0.098125 = 1.0$.\n\nStep 2: Calculation of expected genotype counts.\nThe expected count for a genotype class is the total sample size $N$ multiplied by the expected frequency of that genotype under HWE, using the estimated allele frequencies.\nExpected count for homozygote $A_iA_i$: $E_{ii} = N \\hat{p}_i^2$.\nExpected count for heterozygote $A_iA_j$: $E_{ij} = N (2\\hat{p}_i\\hat{p}_j)$.\nUsing $N=800$ and the estimated frequencies:\n$E_{11} = 800 \\times (0.4)^2 = 800 \\times 0.16 = 128$.\n$E_{22} = 800 \\times (0.29875)^2 = 71.40125$.\n$E_{33} = 800 \\times (0.203125)^2 = 33.0078125$.\n$E_{44} = 800 \\times (0.098125)^2 = 7.7028125$.\n$E_{12} = 800 \\times 2 \\times 0.4 \\times 0.29875 = 191.2$.\n$E_{13} = 800 \\times 2 \\times 0.4 \\times 0.203125 = 130$.\n$E_{14} = 800 \\times 2 \\times 0.4 \\times 0.098125 = 62.8$.\n$E_{23} = 800 \\times 2 \\times 0.29875 \\times 0.203125 = 97.09375$.\n$E_{24} = 800 \\times 2 \\times 0.29875 \\times 0.098125 = 46.903125$.\n$E_{34} = 800 \\times 2 \\times 0.203125 \\times 0.098125 = 31.890625$.\nThe sum of these expected counts is $800$.\n\nStep 3: Justification of degrees of freedom.\nThe degrees of freedom ($df$) for a Pearson's chi-square goodness-of-fit test are given by the number of categories minus $1$, minus the number of independent parameters estimated from the data to generate the expected counts.\nFirst, we count the number of categories. For $k$ alleles, there are $k$ possible homozygous genotypes ($A_1A_1, \\dots, A_kA_k$) and $\\binom{k}{2}$ possible heterozygous genotypes ($A_iA_j$ with $i<j$). The total number of genotype categories is:\n$$\\text{Number of categories} = k + \\binom{k}{2} = k + \\frac{k(k-1)}{2} = \\frac{2k + k^2 - k}{2} = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$$\nNext, we count the number of independent parameters estimated. The HWE model is specified by the $k$ allele frequencies $p_1, \\dots, p_k$. However, these frequencies are constrained by $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i = 1$. Thus, only $k-1$ frequencies are independent; once $k-1$ are known, the $k$-th is determined. In this problem, we estimated $k-1 = 4-1 = 3$ independent allele frequencies from the data.\nThe degrees of freedom are therefore:\n$$df = (\\text{Number of categories}) - 1 - (\\text{Number of independent parameters estimated})$$\n$$df = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} - 1 - (k-1) = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} - k$$\n$$df = \\frac{k^2+k-2k}{2} = \\frac{k^2-k}{2} = \\frac{k(k-1)}{2} = \\binom{k}{2}$$\nFor this problem with $k=4$ alleles, the degrees of freedom are $df = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$.\n\nStep 4: Computation of the Pearson chi-square statistic.\nThe statistic is calculated as $\\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(\\text{Observed} - \\text{Expected})^2}{\\text{Expected}}$ for all genotype categories.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part derivation concerning the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in a diploid population with separate sexes, sex-specific allele frequencies, and non-Mendelian segregation in one sex.\n\nFirst, we address Task 1: Derive the allele frequency of $A$ among male gametes, $p_m$, and among female gametes, $p_f$.\n\nThe adult female population is assumed to be in Hardy-Weinberg proportions with an allele $A$ frequency of $\\pi_f$. The genotype frequencies for females are therefore:\n- Frequency of $AA$ females: $\\pi_f^2$\n- Frequency of $Aa$ females: $2\\pi_f(1-\\pi_f)$\n- Frequency of $aa$ females: $(1-\\pi_f)^2$\n\nFemale meiosis is Mendelian. $AA$ individuals produce only $A$ gametes (with probability $1$), $Aa$ individuals produce $A$ gametes with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$, and $aa$ individuals produce no $A$ gametes (probability $0$). The frequency of allele $A$ in the pool of female gametes, $p_f$, is the weighted average of the production of $A$ gametes from each genotype:\n$$p_f = (1) \\cdot (\\pi_f^2) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdot (2\\pi_f(1-\\pi_f)) + (0) \\cdot ((1-\\pi_f)^2)$$\n$$p_f = \\pi_f^2 + \\pi_f(1-\\pi_f) = \\pi_f^2 + \\pi_f - \\pi_f^2 = \\pi_f$$\nAs expected under Mendelian inheritance, the allele frequency in the gametes is identical to that in the parental generation.\n\nThe adult male population is in Hardy-Weinberg proportions with an allele $A$ frequency of $\\pi_m$. The genotype frequencies for males are:\n- Frequency of $AA$ males: $\\pi_m^2$\n- Frequency of $Aa$ males: $2\\pi_m(1-\\pi_m)$\n- Frequency of $aa$ males: $(1-\\pi_m)^2$\n\nMale meiosis exhibits segregation distortion, where heterozygous ($Aa$) males transmit the $A$ allele with probability $k$. Homozygous males transmit their allele with certainty. The frequency of allele $A$ in the pool of male gametes, $p_m$, is therefore:\n$$p_m = (1) \\cdot (\\pi_m^2) + (k) \\cdot (2\\pi_m(1-\\pi_m)) + (0) \\cdot ((1-\\pi_m)^2)$$\n$$p_m = \\pi_m^2 + 2k\\pi_m(1-\\pi_m)$$\n\nThis completes the first task. For the second task, we must find the condition for zygotes to be in HWE. Zygotes form by the random union of male and female gametes. The genotype frequencies in the zygote generation are:\n- Frequency of $AA$ zygotes: $P(AA) = p_m p_f$\n- Frequency of $Aa$ zygotes: $P(Aa) = p_m(1-p_f) + p_f(1-p_m)$\n- Frequency of $aa$ zygotes: $P(aa) = (1-p_m)(1-p_f)$\n\nThe overall frequency of allele $A$ in the zygote population, let's call it $p_{zygote}$, is the average of the frequencies in the two gamete pools, as each sex contributes equally:\n$$p_{zygote} = \\frac{p_m + p_f}{2}$$\nFor the zygote population to be in HWE, its genotype frequencies must be given by $P(AA) = p_{zygote}^2$, $P(Aa) = 2 p_{zygote}(1-p_{zygote})$, and $P(aa) = (1-p_{zygote})^2$. We can test this condition using any of the genotype frequencies. Let us use $P(AA)$:\n$$P(AA) = p_{zygote}^2$$\n$$p_m p_f = \\left(\\frac{p_m + p_f}{2}\\right)^2$$\nExpanding the right side gives:\n$$p_m p_f = \\frac{p_m^2 + 2p_m p_f + p_f^2}{4}$$\nMultiplying by $4$ and rearranging terms:\n$$4p_m p_f = p_m^2 + 2p_m p_f + p_f^2$$\n$$0 = p_m^2 - 2p_m p_f + p_f^2$$\nThis is the expansion of a squared difference:\n$$0 = (p_m - p_f)^2$$\nThis equation holds if and only if $p_m - p_f = 0$, which means $p_m = p_f$. Therefore, the fundamental condition for the zygote population to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is that the allele frequencies in the male and female gamete pools must be identical. If $p_m \\neq p_f$ (and we are not at a boundary where an allele is fixed), then $(p_m - p_f)^2 > 0$, the condition is not met, and the zygote population will not be in HWE.\n\nFinally, for the third task, we must solve for the value of the distortion parameter, $k^{\\star}$, that restores HWE among zygotes. This requires imposing the condition derived in Task 2, $p_m = p_f$, using the expressions for $p_m$ and $p_f$ derived in Task 1.\n$$p_f = \\pi_f$$\n$$p_m = \\pi_m^2 + 2k\\pi_m(1-\\pi_m)$$\nSetting them equal to find $k^{\\star}$:\n$$\\pi_m^2 + 2k^{\\star}\\pi_m(1-\\pi_m) = \\pi_f$$\nWe now solve for $k^{\\star}$. Rearranging the equation:\n$$2k^{\\star}\\pi_m(1-\\pi_m) = \\pi_f - \\pi_m^2$$\nGiven the assumption that $0 < \\pi_m < 1$, the term $\\pi_m(1-\\pi_m)$ is non-zero, and we can divide by $2\\pi_m(1-\\pi_m)$ to isolate $k^{\\star}$:\n$$k^{\\star} = \\frac{\\pi_f - \\pi_m^2}{2\\pi_m(1-\\pi_m)}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the segregation distortion parameter $k^{\\star}$ that equalizes the gametic allele frequencies, thereby ensuring the resulting zygote population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi_f - \\pi_m^2}{2 \\pi_m (1 - \\pi_m)}}$$", "id": "2721761"}]}
