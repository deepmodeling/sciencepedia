Consider the uranium-238 to lead-206 decay system under the following standard assumptions: no initial daughter at closure, no subsequent gain or loss of parent or daughter, and a constant decay constant. Let the number of parent atoms be $N(t)$ and the number of radiogenic daughter atoms be $D(t)$ at time $t$ after closure. The fundamental radioactive decay law is given by the first-order differential equation $dN/dt=-\\lambda N$, where $\\lambda$ is the decay constant.

It describes a standard scenario in U-Pb geochronology, a fundamental technique for determining the age of geological materials. The governing differential equation, the initial condition (no initial daughter product), and the closed-system assumption are cornerstones of the accepted model for radiometric dating. All necessary parameters are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. The data values are physically realistic. The problem is not trivial, as it requires derivation from a fundamental law, numerical calculation, and a sensitivity analysis that probes the understanding of error propagation in the model.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe fundamental law of radioactive decay is given as a first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = -\\lambda N(t)\n$$\nThis equation is solved by separation of variables. Let $N_0$ be the number of parent atoms at the time of the crystal's closure, $t=0$.\n$$\n\\int_{N_0}^{N(t)} \\frac{dN}{N} = -\\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda dt'\n$$\nIntegrating both sides yields:\n$$\n\\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N_0) = -\\lambda t\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = -\\lambda t\n$$\nSolving for $N(t)$, we obtain the exponential decay law:\n$$\nN(t) = N_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nThe assumption of a closed system implies that the total number of original parent atoms, $N_0$, is conserved. These atoms are now present either as remaining parent atoms, $N(t)$, or as accumulated radiogenic daughter atoms, $D(t)$. The assumption of no initial daughter atoms ($D(0)=0$) gives the simple conservation relation:\n$$\nN_0 = N(t) + D(t)\n$$\nThe number of daughter atoms at time $t$ is therefore the number of parent atoms that have decayed:\n$$\nD(t) = N_0 - N(t)\n$$\nThe problem provides the present-day measured ratio of daughter to parent atoms, denoted as $R = \\frac{D}{P}$. In our notation, this is $R = \\frac{D(t)}{N(t)}$. We can express this ratio in terms of the initial and present number of parent atoms:\n$$\nR = \\frac{D(t)}{N(t)} = \\frac{N_0 - N(t)}{N(t)} = \\frac{N_0}{N(t)} - 1\n$$\nFrom the exponential decay law, we have $\\frac{N_0}{N(t)} = \\frac{1}{\\exp(-\\lambda t)} = \\exp(\\lambda t)$. Substituting this into the expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\exp(\\lambda t) - 1\n$$\nThis equation relates the measurable ratio $R$ to the sample age $t$. We now solve for $t$:\n$$\nR + 1 = \\exp(\\lambda t)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(R + 1) = \\lambda t\n$$\nThe expression for the sample age $t$ in terms of $R$ and $\\lambda$ is therefore:\n$$\nt = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln(R + 1)\n$$\nThis is the fundamental age equation for this system, derived as required.\n\nNext, we evaluate $t$ for the given values $R = \\frac{D}{P} = 0.25$ and $\\lambda = 1.55125 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$.\n$$\nt = \\frac{1}{1.55125 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}} \\ln(0.25 + 1) = \\frac{\\ln(1.25)}{1.55125 \\times 10^{-10}} \\ \\mathrm{yr}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(1.25) \\approx 0.22314355$, we calculate the age in years:\n$$\nt \\approx \\frac{0.22314355}{1.55125 \\times 10^{-10}} \\ \\mathrm{yr} \\approx 1438466241 \\ \\mathrm{yr} \\approx 1.438466 \\times 10^9 \\ \\mathrm{yr}\n$$\nThe problem requires the age in mega-annum (Ma), where $1 \\ \\mathrm{Ma} = 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{yr}$.\n$$\nt \\approx \\frac{1.438466 \\times 10^9}{10^6} \\ \\mathrm{Ma} = 1438.466 \\ \\mathrm{Ma}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required gives:\n$$\nt \\approx 1438 \\ \\mathrm{Ma}\n$$\n\nFinally, we determine the local sensitivity of $t$ to small perturbations in the measured ratio $R$. This is given by the derivative $\\frac{dt}{dR}$.\n$$\n\\frac{dt}{dR} = \\frac{d}{dR} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln(R + 1) \\right] = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\cdot \\frac{1}{R+1} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda(R+1)}\n$$\nWe evaluate this sensitivity at $R=0.25$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{dt}{dR} \\right|_{R=0.25} = \\frac{1}{(1.55125 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{yr}^{-1})(0.25+1)} = \\frac{1}{(1.55125 \\times 10^{-10})(1.25)} \\ \\mathrm{yr}\n$$\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{dt}{dR} \\right|_{R=0.25} \\approx \\frac{1}{1.9390625 \\times 10^{-10}} \\ \\mathrm{yr} \\approx 5.1571 \\times 10^9 \\ \\mathrm{yr}\n$$\nExpressed in Ma, the sensitivity is approximately $5157 \\ \\mathrm{Ma}$.\n\n**Interpretation of Sensitivity:**\nThe sign of the sensitivity, $\\frac{dt}{dR}$, is positive, as $\\lambda > 0$ and $R \\ge 0$. This is physically correct: an increase in the measured ratio of daughter to parent atoms signifies that more decay has occurred, which corresponds to a greater elapsed time, or an older age.\nThe magnitude of the sensitivity, $\\approx 5157 \\ \\mathrm{Ma}$, is extremely large. This value represents the rate of change of the calculated age with respect to the measured ratio. In terms of error propagation, a small uncertainty $\\delta R$ in the measurement of the ratio $R$ propagates to an uncertainty in age $\\delta t$ as follows: $\\delta t \\approx \\frac{dt}{dR} \\delta R$. With a sensitivity of over $5$ billion years, even a very small absolute error in measuring $R$ translates into a very large error in the calculated age, on the scale of millions to tens of millions of years. For example, an analytical uncertainty of $\\delta R = \\pm 0.001$ would result in an age uncertainty of $\\delta t \\approx (\\pm 0.001) \\times (5157 \\ \\mathrm{Ma}) = \\pm 5.157 \\ \\mathrm{Ma}$. This demonstrates that the calculated age is highly sensitive to the precision of the isotopic ratio measurement. The large magnitude of this sensitivity over geological time scales necessitates the use of high-precision mass spectrometry in geochronology to obtain meaningful and reliable age determinations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.438 \\times 10^{3}}$$", "id": "2720326"}, {"introduction": "A single analysis is rarely the final word on the age of a geological event.

A hiatus of this nature represents an unconformity, specifically a disconformity if the strata above and below are parallel.\n\n1.  **Geological (Physical Stratigraphic) Evidence**: An erosional surface, or unconformity, may be identified through direct physical evidence at the contact between rock layers. A geologist would look for a sharp, irregular, or undulating surface separating the lower horizon, $H_0$, from the stratum containing the upper horizon, $H_1$. Key indicators include: a layer of reworked clasts or pebbles from the underlying unit forming a basal conglomerate in the overlying unit; evidence of subaerial exposure such as paleosols (fossil soils), desiccation cracks, or root traces; or in marine environments, a bored or encrusted hardground surface indicating a period of non-deposition and submarine cementation. Any of these features provides direct physical proof of a time gap due to erosion or non-deposition.\n\n2.  **Biostratigraphic Evidence**: Biostratigraphy utilizes the ordered succession of fossils to date and correlate strata. Different intervals of geologic time are characterized by unique fossil assemblages, organized into biozones. A detailed analysis of the fossil content through the stratigraphic section would be performed. If one or more biozones, which are known from complete reference sections elsewhere to occur between the faunas of horizon $H_0$ and horizon $H_1$, are absent, this constitutes strong evidence for a hiatus. For example, if $H_0$ is in Biozone A and $H_1$ is in Biozone C, the absence of the intervening Biozone B indicates that the time corresponding to Biozone B is not represented by sediment at this location.
