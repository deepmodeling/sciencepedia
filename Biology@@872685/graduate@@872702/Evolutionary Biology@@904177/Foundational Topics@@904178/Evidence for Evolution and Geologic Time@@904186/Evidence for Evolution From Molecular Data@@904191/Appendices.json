Out of the $1000$ sites, exactly $850$ positions are identical between the two sequences.

Do not approximate numerically, and do not include any units. If you choose to express the $p$-value using a special function, it must be in a standard closed form.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an exact $p$-value to test the hypothesis that the observed identity between two DNA sequences is due to random chance. This constitutes a formal hypothesis test.\n\nFirst, we formalize the null model. The null hypothesis, $H_0$, states that the two sequences are generated independently and randomly. The sequences are of length $N = 1000$. At each of the $N$ sites, each sequence draws a nucleotide from the set $\\{A, C, G, T\\}$ with a uniform probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$ for each nucleotide. The draws are independent across all sites and between the two sequences.\n\nThe task is to compute a $p$-value, which is the probability of observing a result at least as extreme as the one found. The observed result is $k_{obs} = 850$ identical sites. The direction of \"more extreme\" is specified as toward more identical sites.\n\nWe begin by calculating the probability, $p$, of a match at a single, arbitrary site under $H_0$. Let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be the nucleotides at a given site in the first and second sequences, respectively. A match occurs if $S_1 = S_2$. Because the nucleotide choices are independent, the probability of any specific match (e.g., both are $A$) is $P(S_1=A \\text{ and } S_2=A) = P(S_1=A)P(S_2=A) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$. Since there are four possible nucleotides, the total probability of a match is the sum of the probabilities of matching as $A$, $C$, $G$, or $T$:\n$$p = P(S_1=S_2) = P(S_1=S_2=A) + P(S_1=S_2=C) + P(S_1=S_2=G) + P(S_1=S_2=T)$$\n$$p = 4 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nThe probability of a non-match at a site is $1 - p = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nThe alignment of $N=1000$ sites can be treated as a sequence of $N$ independent Bernoulli trials. Each trial corresponds to a site, and a \"success\" is defined as an identity at that site. The probability of success for each trial is $p = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nLet $K$ be the random variable representing the total number of identical sites. Since $K$ is the sum of $N$ independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials, it follows a Binomial distribution, $K \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, p)$. The probability mass function (PMF) of $K$ is given by:\n$$P(K=k) = \\binom{N}{k} p^k (1-p)^{N-k}$$\nFor this problem, with $N=1000$ and $p=\\frac{1}{4}$, the PMF is:\n$$P(K=k) = \\binom{1000}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^k \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{1000-k}$$\nThe $p$-value is the probability of observing $k_{obs} = 850$ or more identical sites. This is calculated by summing the probabilities for all values of $k$ from $850$ to $1000$:\n$$p\\text{-value} = P(K \\ge 850) = \\sum_{k=850}^{1000} P(K=k)$$\nSubstituting the PMF into this summation gives the exact, closed-form expression for the $p$-value:\n$$p\\text{-value} = \\sum_{k=850}^{1000} \\binom{1000}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^k \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{1000-k}$$\nThis expression is the result of applying first principles of probability as required.\n\nInterpretation:\nThe $p$-value quantifies the probability of observing a level of sequence identity of $850$ out of $1000$ sites, or higher, purely by chance if the two sequences were unrelated (the null model). The expected number of identical sites under this null model is $E[K] = Np = 1000 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 250$. The observed value of $850$ sites is far in the tail of the distribution, meaning the calculated $p$-value will be extremely small. A miniscule $p$-value indicates that the observed data are highly inconsistent with the null hypothesis of a random match. This provides strong statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The rejection of the random-match model lends significant support to the alternative hypothesis: that the sequences are homologous, meaning they share a common ancestor. The high similarity is thus explained as a consequence of shared evolutionary history, rather than an astronomically improbable coincidence. The $p$-value is a direct measure of the statistical surprisingness of the data under the assumption of randomness.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sum_{k=850}^{1000} \\binom{1000}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^k \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{1000-k}}$$", "id": "2706445"}, {"introduction": "After establishing that two sequences share a common ancestor, we can ask when that ancestor lived.

The problem specifies the Jukes-Cantor (JC) model. In the JC model, all nucleotide substitutions occur at the same rate. The total rate of substitution away from any nucleotide is given as $\\mu$.

The elements $Q_{ij}$ for $i \\neq j$ are the rates of transition from state $i$ to state $j$, and the diagonal elements $Q_{ii}$ are such that the rows sum to zero. Thus, $Q_{ii} = -\\sum_{j \\neq i} Q_{ij} = -3(\\frac{\\mu}{3}) = -\\mu$.

The total time separating the sequences at any site is $2T$. We want to find the probability, $p$, that the nucleotides at a homologous site are different.
