Assume no epistasis and that environmental deviations have mean zero and are independent of genotype, so that the observed genotype means equal the true genotypic values.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid and we proceed with its resolution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of the average effect of allele substitution ($\\alpha$), the additive genetic variance ($V_A$), and the dominance variance ($V_D$) for a single locus with two alleles in a population at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.\n\nFirst, we define the parameters and random variables as specified. The population is diploid and at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. There are two alleles, $A$ and $a$, with frequencies $p$ and $q$ respectively. We are given $p = 0.7$, which implies $q = 1 - p = 0.3$. The genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ have frequencies $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2$.\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing the number of $A$ alleles in a genotype. $X$ can take values $2$, $1$, or $0$ for genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$, respectively. The probabilities are:\n$P(X=2) = p^2 = (0.7)^2 = 0.49$\n$P(X=1) = 2pq = 2(0.7)(0.3) = 0.42$\n$P(X=0) = q^2 = (0.3)^2 = 0.09$\nThe sum of these probabilities is $0.49 + 0.42 + 0.09 = 1.0$, as required.\n\nLet $G$ be the random variable for the genotypic value. The problem provides the following values for $G$:\n$G_{AA} = 10$ (for $X=2$)\n$G_{Aa} = 9.5$ (for $X=1$)\n$G_{aa} = 8$ (for $X=0$)\n\nTo address the three parts of the problem, we must first compute the necessary population moments for the variables $X$ and $G$.\n\nThe expectation of $X$ is:\n$$E[X] = \\sum_{i} x_i P(X=x_i) = (2)(p^2) + (1)(2pq) + (0)(q^2) = 2p^2 + 2pq = 2p(p+q) = 2p$$\nNumerically, $E[X] = 2(0.7) = 1.4$.\n\nThe expectation of $X^2$ is:\n$$E[X^2] = \\sum_{i} x_i^2 P(X=x_i) = (2^2)(p^2) + (1^2)(2pq) + (0^2)(q^2) = 4p^2 + 2pq$$\nNumerically, $E[X^2] = 4(0.7)^2 + 2(0.7)(0.3) = 4(0.49) + 0.42 = 1.96 + 0.42 = 2.38$.\n\nThe variance of $X$ is:\n$$\\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 = (4p^2 + 2pq) - (2p)^2 = 4p^2 + 2pq - 4p^2 = 2pq$$\nNumerically, $\\text{Var}(X) = 2(0.7)(0.3) = 0.42$.\n\nThe expectation of $G$, which is the mean genotypic value of the population, is:\n$$\\mu_G = E[G] = G_{AA} p^2 + G_{Aa} 2pq + G_{aa} q^2$$\nNumerically, $E[G] = (10)(0.49) + (9.5)(0.42) + (8)(0.09) = 4.9 + 3.99 + 0.72 = 9.61$.\n\nThe expectation of the product $XG$ is:\n$$E[XG] = (2)(G_{AA})(p^2) + (1)(G_{Aa})(2pq) + (0)(G_{aa})(q^2)$$\nNumerically, $E[XG] = (2)(10)(0.49) + (1)(9.5)(0.42) + (0)(8)(0.09) = 9.8 + 3.99 = 13.79$.\n\nThe covariance of $X$ and $G$ is:\n$$\\text{Cov}(X,G) = E[XG] - E[X]E[G]$$\nNumerically, $\\text{Cov}(X,G) = 13.79 - (1.4)(9.61) = 13.79 - 13.454 = 0.336$.\n\n1. Derive and compute $\\alpha$.\nThe problem defines the average effect of allele substitution, $\\alpha$, as the slope of the least-squares linear regression of genotypic value $G$ on allele count $X$. The regression model is $\\hat{G} = \\beta_0 + \\alpha X$. The principle of least squares minimizes the expected squared error, $S = E[(G - (\\beta_0 + \\alpha X))^2]$. The normal equations are obtained by setting the partial derivatives of $S$ with respect to $\\beta_0$ and $\\alpha$ to zero.\n$\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\beta_0} = -2 E[G - \\beta_0 - \\alpha X] = 0 \\implies E[G] = \\beta_0 + \\alpha E[X]$.\n$\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\alpha} = -2 E[X(G - \\beta_0 - \\alpha X)] = 0 \\implies E[XG] = \\beta_0 E[X] + \\alpha E[X^2]$.\nSubstituting $\\beta_0 = E[G] - \\alpha E[X]$ into the second equation:\n$E[XG] = (E[G] - \\alpha E[X])E[X] + \\alpha E[X^2]$\n$E[XG] - E[G]E[X] = \\alpha (E[X^2] - (E[X])^2)$\nThis simplifies to $\\text{Cov}(X,G) = \\alpha \\text{Var}(X)$.\nThus, the expression for $\\alpha$ is derived from first principles:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X,G)}{\\text{Var}(X)}$$\nUsing our computed numerical values:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{0.336}{0.42} = 0.8$$\n\n2. Derive and compute $V_A$.\nThe problem defines the additive genetic value (breeding value), $A$, as the fitted value from the regression. The set of breeding values $\\{A_i\\}$ for genotypes $\\{i\\}$ are the points on the regression line corresponding to their allele count $x_i$. The regression model can be written as $A = \\hat{G}(X) = \\beta_0 + \\alpha X$.\nThe additive genetic variance, $V_A$, is the variance of these breeding values:\n$$V_A = \\text{Var}(A) = \\text{Var}(\\hat{G}) = \\text{Var}(\\beta_0 + \\alpha X)$$\nSince $\\beta_0$ and $\\alpha$ are constants determined by the population parameters, the variance simplifies:\n$$V_A = \\text{Var}(\\alpha X) = \\alpha^2 \\text{Var}(X)$$\nThis derivation is based directly on the provided definition. Now we compute the value:\n$$V_A = (0.8)^2 \\times (0.42) = 0.64 \\times 0.42 = 0.2688$$\n\n3. Define, derive, and compute $V_D$.\nThe dominance deviation, $D$, is defined as the residual from the regression, i.e., the difference between the actual genotypic value $G$ and the predicted breeding value $A$.\n$$D = G - A = G - \\hat{G}$$\nThe dominance variance, $V_D$, is the variance of the dominance deviations, $V_D = \\text{Var}(D)$.\nThe mean of the dominance deviations is always zero by construction of the least-squares regression:\n$E[D] = E[G - \\hat{G}] = E[G] - E[\\hat{G}] = E[G] - E[\\beta_0 + \\alpha X] = E[G] - (\\beta_0 + \\alpha E[X])$. From the first normal equation, $\\beta_0 + \\alpha E[X] = E[G]$, so $E[D] = 0$.\nTherefore, the variance is simply the expectation of the squared deviations:\n$$V_D = E[D^2] - (E[D])^2 = E[(G - \\hat{G})^2]$$\nWe calculate the specific deviations for each genotype. First we find the intercept $\\beta_0 = E[G] - \\alpha E[X] = 9.61 - (0.8)(1.4) = 9.61 - 1.12 = 8.49$.\nThe regression line is $\\hat{G}(X) = 8.49 + 0.8 X$.\nFor genotype $AA$ ($X=2$):\n$A_{AA} = \\hat{G}(2) = 8.49 + 0.8(2) = 10.09$\n$D_{AA} = G_{AA} - A_{AA} = 10 - 10.09 = -0.09$\nFor genotype $Aa$ ($X=1$):\n$A_{Aa} = \\hat{G}(1) = 8.49 + 0.8(1) = 9.29$\n$D_{Aa} = G_{Aa} - A_{Aa} = 9.5 - 9.29 = 0.21$\nFor genotype $aa$ ($X=0$):\n$A_{aa} = \\hat{G}(0) = 8.49 + 0.8(0) = 8.49$\n$D_{aa} = G_{aa} - A_{aa} = 8 - 8.49 = -0.49$\nThe dominance variance is the weighted average of the squared deviations:\n$$V_D = (D_{AA})^2 p^2 + (D_{Aa})^2 (2pq) + (D_{aa})^2 q^2$$\nNumerically:\n$$V_D = (-0.09)^2 (0.49) + (0.21)^2 (0.42) + (-0.49)^2 (0.09)$$\n$$V_D = (0.0081)(0.49) + (0.0441)(0.42) + (0.2401)(0.09)$$\n$$V_D = 0.003969 + 0.018522 + 0.021609 = 0.0441$$\n\nConclusion on the genetic architecture:\nWe have computed the additive genetic variance $V_A = 0.2688$ and the dominance variance $V_D = 0.0441$. Comparing these magnitudes, it is clear that $V_A  V_D$. The additive variance is approximately $0.2688 / 0.0441 \\approx 6.1$ times larger than the dominance variance.\nTherefore, under the given conditions ($p=0.7$, and the specified genotypic values), the additive component $V_A$ dominates the genetic architecture of this trait. This dominance of $V_A$ arises because the average effect of substituting an allele ($\\alpha=0.8$) contributes more significantly to the total genetic variance than the non-linear deviations from the additive model (dominance effects). The value of $V_A$ is proportional to $\\alpha^2$, while $V_D$ is related to the squared dominance effect. In this case, the larger magnitude of the squared average effect of substitution, scaled by allele frequencies, results in a substantially larger additive variance compared to the dominance variance.\n\nRounding the results to four significant figures gives:\n$\\alpha = 0.8000$\n$V_A = 0.2688$\n$V_D = 0.04410$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.8000  0.2688  0.04410 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2741522"}, {"introduction": "One of the central goals of partitioning phenotypic variance is to predict how a population will respond to selection, and the narrow-sense heritability, $h^2$, isolates the portion of variance that fuels this evolutionary change.

It is well-posed, providing all necessary data and assumptions for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The assumption that phenotypic variance $V_P$ is constant while its component, additive genetic variance $V_A$, changes is a strong simplification. However, it is explicitly stated as a condition for solving this specific problem, a common pedagogical tool to isolate a particular phenomenon. Under this instructional constraint, the problem is internally consistent and solvable. It does not violate any fundamental principles within its own defined framework. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe fundamental relationship governing the response to selection for a quantitative trait is the breeder's equation. For each generation $t$, this is given by:\n$$R_t = h_t^2 S_t$$\nwhere $R_t$ is the response to selection, $S_t$ is the selection differential, and $h_t^2$ is the narrow-sense heritability. The narrow-sense heritability is defined as the ratio of additive genetic variance, $V_{A,t}$, to the total phenotypic variance, $V_{P,t}$:\n$$h_t^2 = \\frac{V_{A,t}}{V_{P,t}}$$\nThe problem asks us to determine the trajectory of $h_t^2$, infer the change in $V_{A,t}$, and compute the ratio $V_{A,6}/V_{A,1}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the narrow-sense heritability for each of the $6$ generations using the provided data and rearranging the breeder's equation to $h_t^2 = R_t / S_t$.\n\nFor generation $t=1$:\n$$h_1^2 = \\frac{R_1}{S_1} = \\frac{0.504}{1.2} = 0.42$$\n\nFor generation $t=2$:\n$$h_2^2 = \\frac{R_2}{S_2} = \\frac{0.54}{1.5} = 0.36$$\n\nFor generation $t=3$:\n$$h_3^2 = \\frac{R_3}{S_3} = \\frac{0.462}{1.4} = 0.33$$\n\nFor generation $t=4$:\n$$h_4^2 = \\frac{R_4}{S_4} = \\frac{0.377}{1.3} = 0.29$$\n\nFor generation $t=5$:\n$$h_5^2 = \\frac{R_5}{S_5} = \\frac{0.40}{1.6} = 0.25$$\n\nFor generation $t=6$:\n$$h_6^2 = \\frac{R_6}{S_6} = \\frac{0.33}{1.5} = 0.22$$\n\nThe trajectory of narrow-sense heritability across the $6$ generations is $\\{0.42, 0.36, 0.33, 0.29, 0.25, 0.22\\}$. There is a clear and monotonic decrease in $h_t^2$ over time.\n\nNext, we infer the dynamics of the additive genetic variance $V_A$. The problem states we must treat the phenotypic variance $V_P$ as constant across generations. Let us denote this constant value by $V_{P, \\text{const}}$. The relationship between $V_{A,t}$ and $h_t^2$ is then:\n$$V_{A,t} = h_t^2 \\times V_{P,t} = h_t^2 \\times V_{P, \\text{const}}$$\nThis equation shows that, under the assumption of constant phenotypic variance, the additive genetic variance $V_{A,t}$ is directly proportional to the narrow-sense heritability $h_t^2$. As we have observed a consistent decrease in $h_t^2$ from generation $1$ to generation $6$, we must conclude that the additive genetic variance $V_A$ was depleted by the sustained directional selection. This is the expected outcome, as selection tends to fix alleles that contribute favorably to the trait, thereby reducing the genetic variation for that trait in the population.\n\nFinally, we compute the proportion of additive genetic variance remaining in generation $6$ relative to generation $1$. This is the ratio $V_{A,6}/V_{A,1}$. Using the relationship derived above:\n$$\\frac{V_{A,6}}{V_{A,1}} = \\frac{h_6^2 \\times V_{P, \\text{const}}}{h_1^2 \\times V_{P, \\text{const}}}$$\nThe constant term $V_{P, \\text{const}}$ cancels out, leaving the ratio of the heritabilities:\n$$\\frac{V_{A,6}}{V_{A,1}} = \\frac{h_6^2}{h_1^2}$$\nSubstituting the computed values for $h_1^2$ and $h_6^2$:\n$$\\frac{V_{A,6}}{V_{A,1}} = \\frac{0.22}{0.42} = \\frac{11}{21}$$\nTo express this as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$\\frac{11}{21} \\approx 0.52380952...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.5238$.

It requires a non-trivial derivation based on statistical properties of the normal distribution and principles of quantitative genetics. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds first with the derivation of the general transformation, then the specific numerical calculation, and finally the interpretation.\n\nThe central task is to relate the additive genetic variance on the observed scale in the sample, $V_A^o$, to the additive genetic variance on the liability scale, $V_A^\\ell$. The liability-scale heritability is $h_\\ell^2 = V_A^\\ell$ since $\\operatorname{Var}(L)=1$. The observed-scale heritability is $h_o^2 = V_A^o / [P(1-P)]$.\n\nLet the total additive genetic value (breeding value) for liability be $A$. We assume $A$ is a sum of effects from many unlinked genetic loci and, by the central limit theorem, is normally distributed. The regression of liability $L$ on $A$ in the population is $\\beta_{L,A} = \\operatorname{Cov}(L,A)/\\operatorname{Var}(A)$. Since $L = A + E$, where $E$ is the environmental component uncorrelated with $A$, we have $\\operatorname{Cov}(L,A) = \\operatorname{Var}(A) = V_A^\\ell$. Therefore, $\\beta_{L,A} = V_A^\\ell / V_A^\\ell = 1$. The regression of the genetic value $A$ on the liability $L$ is $\\beta_{A,L} = \\operatorname{Cov}(A,L)/\\operatorname{Var}(L) = V_A^\\ell / 1 = h_\\ell^2$. This gives the conditional expectation $\\mathbb{E}[A|L] = h_\\ell^2 L$, assuming population means are zero.\n\nThe additive genetic variance on the observed scale, $V_A^o$, is the variance of breeding values for the observed trait $Y$ in the ascertained sample. The breeding value for $Y$ can be approximated through a linear regression of $Y$ on the additive genetic value $A$. This relationship is established via the liability $L$. We relate the regression coefficient of $Y$ on an individual genetic variant's standardized genotype, $G^*$, in the sample to the variant's effect on liability, $\\alpha$.\nLet the effect of a standardized variant $G^*$ on liability be $\\alpha$, so $L = \\alpha G^* + \\dots$. The total additive genetic value is $A = \\sum_i \\alpha_i G_i^*$. The liability-scale heritability is $h_\\ell^2 = V_A^\\ell = \\operatorname{Var}(A) = \\sum_i \\operatorname{Var}(\\alpha_i G_i^*) = \\sum_i \\alpha_i^2$, assuming standardized genotypes ($\\operatorname{Var}(G_i^*)=1$) and no linkage disequilibrium.\nThe regression coefficient of the observed trait $Y$ on $G_i^*$ in the sample, $\\beta_i$, is $\\beta_i = \\operatorname{Cov}_{\\text{sample}}(Y, G_i^*) / \\operatorname{Var}_{\\text{sample}}(G_i^*)$. We assume ascertainment does not significantly alter the variance of genotypes, so $\\operatorname{Var}_{\\text{sample}}(G_i^*) \\approx \\operatorname{Var}_{\\text{pop}}(G_i^*) = 1$.\nThus, $\\beta_i \\approx \\operatorname{Cov}_{\\text{sample}}(Y, G_i^*)$.\nThe covariance is $\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\text{sample}}(Y, G_i^*) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\text{sample}}[YG_i^*] - \\mathbb{E}_{\\text{sample}}[Y]\\mathbb{E}_{\\text{sample}}[G_i^*]$.\nThe sample consists of a fraction $P$ of cases ($Y=1$) and $1-P$ of controls ($Y=0$).\n$\\mathbb{E}_{\\text{sample}}[Y] = P$.\n$\\mathbb{E}_{\\text{sample}}[YG_i^*] = P \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[G_i^* | Y=1] + (1-P) \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[0 \\cdot G_i^* | Y=0] = P \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[G_i^* | \\text{case}]$.\n$\\mathbb{E}_{\\text{sample}}[G_i^*] = P \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[G_i^* | \\text{case}] + (1-P) \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[G_i^* | \\text{control}]$.\nSubstituting these into the covariance expression:\n$\\beta_i \\approx \\operatorname{Cov}_{\\text{sample}}(Y, G_i^*) = P \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[G_i^* | \\text{case}] - P (P \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[G_i^* | \\text{case}] + (1-P) \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[G_i^* | \\text{control}])$\n$\\beta_i \\approx P(1-P) (\\mathbb{E}[G_i^* | \\text{case}] - \\mathbb{E}[G_i^* | \\text{control}])$.\nThe conditional expectation of the genotype, given case/control status, can be found using the regression of $G_i^*$ on liability $L$. Assuming bivariate normality of $(L, G_i^*)$, we have $\\mathbb{E}[G_i^*|L] = (\\operatorname{Cov}(G_i^*,L)/\\operatorname{Var}(L))(L-\\mathbb{E}[L])$. The effect $\\alpha_i$ is precisely this regression coefficient, $\\operatorname{Cov}(G_i^*,L)/\\operatorname{Var}(L)$, as $\\operatorname{Var}(L)=1$. So $\\mathbb{E}[G_i^*|L] = \\alpha_i L$.\n$\\mathbb{E}[G_i^* | \\text{case}] = \\mathbb{E}[G_i^* | Lt] = \\mathbb{E}[\\alpha_i L | Lt] = \\alpha_i \\mathbb{E}[L|Lt]$.\n$\\mathbb{E}[G_i^* | \\text{control}] = \\mathbb{E}[G_i^* | Lt] = \\mathbb{E}[\\alpha_i L | Lt] = \\alpha_i \\mathbb{E}[L|Lt]$.\nThe mean of a standard normal truncated at $t$ from below is $\\mathbb{E}[L|Lt] = \\phi(t)/K$. The mean when truncated from above is $\\mathbb{E}[L|Lt] = -\\phi(t)/(1-K)$.\nSubstituting these gives:\n$\\beta_i \\approx P(1-P) \\left(\\alpha_i \\frac{\\phi(t)}{K} - \\alpha_i \\frac{-\\phi(t)}{1-K}\\right) = P(1-P) \\alpha_i \\phi(t) \\left(\\frac{1}{K} + \\frac{1}{1-K}\\right) = \\alpha_i \\frac{P(1-P)\\phi(t)}{K(1-K)}$.\nThe additive genetic variance on the observed scale is the variance of the sample breeding values, $V_A^o = \\operatorname{Var}_{\\text{sample}}(\\sum_i \\beta_i G_i^*) = \\sum_i \\beta_i^2$.\n$V_A^o \\approx \\sum_i \\left(\\alpha_i \\frac{P(1-P)\\phi(t)}{K(1-K)}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{P(1-P)\\phi(t)}{K(1-K)}\\right)^2 \\sum_i \\alpha_i^2$.\nRecognizing that $h_\\ell^2 = \\sum_i \\alpha_i^2$, we get:\n$V_A^o \\approx h_\\ell^2 \\left(\\frac{P(1-P)\\phi(t)}{K(1-K)}\\right)^2$.\nThe observed-scale heritability is $h_o^2 = V_A^o / \\operatorname{Var}_{\\text{sample}}(Y) = V_A^o / [P(1-P)]$.\n$$h_o^2 \\approx \\frac{h_\\ell^2}{P(1-P)} \\left(\\frac{P(1-P)\\phi(t)}{K(1-K)}\\right)^2 = h_\\ell^2 \\frac{P(1-P)\\phi(t)^2}{(K(1-K))^2}$$\nThis equation provides the transformation from liability-scale heritability to observed-scale heritability under case-control ascertainment. We can now invert it to solve for $h_\\ell^2$:\n$$h_\\ell^2 \\approx h_o^2 \\frac{(K(1-K))^2}{P(1-P)\\phi(t)^2}$$\nThis is the required general formula.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value.\nGiven: $K=0.2$, $P=0.5$, $h_o^2=0.07$.\nFirst, find the threshold $t$.\n$K = 1 - \\Phi(t) = 0.2 \\implies \\Phi(t) = 0.8$.\nFrom standard normal tables or a computational function, the quantile $t$ such that $\\Phi(t)=0.8$ is $t \\approx 0.84162$.\nNext, compute the standard normal PDF $\\phi(t)$ at this threshold.\n$\\phi(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t^2}{2}\\right)$.\n$\\phi(0.84162) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.84162^2}{2}\\right) \\approx \\frac{1}{2.50663} \\exp(-0.35416) \\approx 0.39894 \\times 0.70176 \\approx 0.27995$.\nNow we compute the terms in the transformation formula:\n$K(1-K) = 0.2 \\times (1-0.2) = 0.2 \\times 0.8 = 0.16$.\n$P(1-P) = 0.5 \\times (1-0.5) = 0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.25$.\n$\\phi(t)^2 \\approx (0.27995)^2 \\approx 0.078372$.\nSubstitute these values into the expression for $h_\\ell^2$:\n$$h_\\ell^2 \\approx 0.07 \\times \\frac{(0.16)^2}{0.25 \\times 0.078372} = 0.07 \\times \\frac{0.0256}{0.019593} \\approx 0.07 \\times 1.30659 \\approx 0.091461$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $h_\\ell^2 \\approx 0.0915$.\n\nFinally, the interpretation of this result.\nThe heritability on the underlying, continuous liability scale ($h_\\ell^2 \\approx 9.2\\%$) is substantially higher than the heritability observed on the dichotomous $0/1$ disease scale in the ascertained sample ($h_o^2 = 7\\%$). This disparity has crucial implications for predicting the response to selection.\nThe response to selection, $R$, on a trait is given by the breeder's equation, $R = h^2 S$, where $h^2$ is the narrow-sense heritability and $S$ is the selection differential. For the underlying liability, the response is $R_\\ell = h_\\ell^2 S_\\ell$.\nA naive expectation based on the observed-scale heritability would use $h_o^2$ to predict the response on liability, which is conceptually incorrect. It would lead to an underestimation of the evolutionary potential of the trait, as $h_o^2  h_\\ell^2$.\nThe transformation from the observed $0/1$ scale to the liability scale accounts for two effects. First, the threshold model itself means that substantial genetic variation in liability can be masked, as all individuals on one side of the threshold share the same phenotype ($0$ or $1$) despite their differing liabilities. This \"compresses\" the apparent genetic variance. Second, the ascertainment scheme, in this case oversampling cases ($P=0.5$ vs $K=0.2$), further distorts the relationship between genetic values and phenotype in the sample compared to the general population.\nThe quantity $h_\\ell^2$ is the true measure of the proportion of variance in liability that is due to additive genetic effects in the population. It is therefore the correct parameter for predicting the change in mean liability across generations in response to selection. The fact that $h_\\ell^2  h_o^2$ indicates a greater potential for the population to respond to selection on liability than would be inferred from simply observing heritability of the binary trait in a case-control study.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0915}$$", "id": "2741533"}]}
