The fundamental equation governing the response to selection is well-established. The provided additive genetic variance-covariance matrix $\\mathbf{G}$ is symmetric and positive definite (its eigenvalues are $\\lambda_{1}=1.5$ and $\\lambda_{2}=0.5$, which are both positive), a necessary condition for a valid covariance matrix. The selection gradient vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is structured to test a classic scenario of direct selection on one trait and a correlated response in another. The problem is well-posed, objective, and complete. All parameters are defined and consistent. The problem is valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds.\n\nThe expected one-generation change in the vector of mean phenotypic traits, $\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}$, under directional selection is described by the multivariate breeder's equation, also known as the Lande equation:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\mathbf{G} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta \\bar{z}_{1} \\\\ \\Delta \\bar{z}_{2} \\end{pmatrix}$ represents the vector of evolutionary responses for traits $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$, $\\mathbf{G}$ is the additive genetic variance-covariance matrix, and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_{1} \\\\ \\beta_{2} \\end{pmatrix}$ is the vector of linear selection gradients, where each element $\\beta_{i}$ quantifies the direct force of selection on trait $z_{i}$.\n\nThe given matrices are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{G} = \\begin{pmatrix} G_{11} & G_{12} \\\\ G_{21} & G_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0.5 \\\\ 0.5 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_{1} \\\\ \\beta_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe components of the $\\mathbf{G}$ matrix are the additive genetic variance of trait $1$ ($G_{11}=1$), the additive genetic variance of trait $2$ ($G_{22}=1$), and the additive genetic covariance between them ($G_{12}=G_{21}=0.5$). The selection gradient vector indicates positive direct selection on trait $z_{1}$ ($\\beta_{1}=0.2$) and no direct selection on trait $z_{2}$ ($\\beta_{2}=0$).\n\nTo compute the response to selection, we perform the matrix multiplication:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta \\bar{z}_{1} \\\\ \\Delta \\bar{z}_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0.5 \\\\ 0.5 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe calculation for each component of the response vector is as follows:\nFor trait $z_{1}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{z}_{1} = G_{11}\\beta_{1} + G_{12}\\beta_{2} = (1)(0.2) + (0.5)(0) = 0.2\n$$\nFor trait $z_{2}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{z}_{2} = G_{21}\\beta_{1} + G_{22}\\beta_{2} = (0.5)(0.2) + (1)(0) = 0.1\n$$\nThus, the expected one-generation change in the mean trait vector is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.2 \\\\ 0.1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nInterpretation of the correlated response:\nThe change in the mean of the second trait, $\\Delta \\bar{z}_{2}$, is $0.1$. This is a \"correlated response\" to selection. There is no direct selection acting on trait $z_{2}$, as indicated by $\\beta_{2}=0$. The response in $z_{2}$ is entirely due to selection acting on trait $z_{1}$, mediated by the genetic covariance between the two traits.\n\nThe formula for the response of trait $z_{2}$, $\\Delta \\bar{z}_{2} = G_{21}\\beta_{1} + G_{22}\\beta_{2}$, explicitly shows this. Since $\\beta_{2}=0$, the expression simplifies to $\\Delta \\bar{z}_{2} = G_{21}\\beta_{1}$. The positive genetic covariance ($G_{21}=0.5$) means that alleles that tend to increase the value of trait $z_{1}$ also tend to increase the value of trait $z_{2}$ (genetic pleiotropy or linkage disequilibrium). Because selection is favoring an increase in trait $z_{1}$ (as $\\beta_{1}=0.2 > 0$), individuals with higher values of $z_{1}$ are selected. These selected individuals pass on their genes to the next generation. Due to the positive genetic covariance, these genes also carry the tendency for higher values of $z_{2}$. Consequently, the mean of trait $z_{2}$ increases in the next generation, even though it was not a direct target of selection.\n\nThe sign of the correlated response is positive, which is the product of the sign of the genetic covariance ($G_{21} > 0$) and the sign of the selection gradient on the directly selected trait ($\\beta_{1} > 0$). The magnitude of the correlated response in $z_{2}$ is $0.1$, which is half the magnitude of the direct response in $z_{1}$ ($\\Delta \\bar{z}_{1}=0.2$). This specific ratio is determined by the ratio of the genetic covariance to the genetic variance of the directly selected trait: $\\frac{\\Delta \\bar{z}_{2}}{\\Delta \\bar{z}_{1}} = \\frac{G_{21}\\beta_{1}}{G_{11}\\beta_{1}} = \\frac{G_{21}}{G_{11}} = \\frac{0.5}{1} = 0.5$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.2 & 0.1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2698966"}, {"introduction": "While the selection gradient, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, quantifies the direct forces of selection, it is not always directly measured.

The second relates the predicted evolutionary response, $\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}$, to $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ and the additive genetic variance-covariance matrix, $\\mathbf{G}$.\n\nFirst, we derive the relationship between $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, $\\mathbf{S}$, and $\\mathbf{P}$. The selection differential vector $\\mathbf{S}$ is defined as the change in the mean phenotypic vector within a single generation due to selection. This can be expressed as the covariance between the vector of phenotypic traits, $\\mathbf{z}$, and relative fitness, $w_{rel} = w(\\mathbf{z})/\\bar{w}$, where $w(\\mathbf{z})$ is the absolute fitness of an individual with phenotype $\\mathbf{z}$ and $\\bar{w}$ is the mean fitness of the population.\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} = \\text{cov}(\\mathbf{z}, w_{rel})\n$$\nBy definition of covariance, and noting that the mean of relative fitness $\\bar{w}_{rel}$ is $1$, this is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} = E[(\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}})(w_{rel} - \\bar{w}_{rel})] = E[(\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}})w_{rel}]\n$$\nThe problem specifies a first-order linear approximation for relative fitness as a function of the deviation of traits from their mean. This is the cornerstone of the Lande-Arnold framework:\n$$\nw_{rel}(\\mathbf{z}) \\approx 1 + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{T}(\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}})\n$$\nHere, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is the vector of directional selection gradients, which quantifies the direct force of directional selection on each trait. Substituting this linear approximation into the expression for $\\mathbf{S}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} \\approx E[(\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}})(1 + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{T}(\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}))]\n$$\nExpanding the product:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} \\approx E[\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}] + E[(\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}})(\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}})^{T}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}]\n$$\nThe first term, $E[\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}]$, equals $\\mathbf{0}$. The second term contains the expectation $E[(\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}})(\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}})^{T}]$, which is the definition of the phenotypic variance-covariance matrix, $\\mathbf{P}$. Thus, we arrive at the fundamental relationship:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{P}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\n$$\nAssuming the phenotypic variance-covariance matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ is non-singular (invertible), we can solve for the selection gradient vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{S}\n$$\nThis equation shows that the selection gradient, which measures direct selection on a trait, can be estimated from the observable selection differential and the phenotypic variances and covariances among traits.\n\nNext, we derive the equation for the one-generation change in the mean trait vector, $\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}$, often called the response to selection. This response depends on the heritable variation subject to selection. The change in the mean breeding value vector, $\\bar{\\mathbf{a}}$, across one generation is the response to selection, $\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}$. Using a similar application of the Price equation, the change in the mean breeding value is the covariance between breeding values and relative fitness:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{a}} = \\text{cov}(\\mathbf{a}, w_{rel})\n$$\nSubstituting the same linear model for relative fitness:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}_i = \\text{cov}(a_i, 1 + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{T}(\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}})) = \\sum_{j} \\text{cov}(a_i, z_j)\\beta_j\n$$\nIn matrix form, this is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\text{cov}(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{z})\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\n$$\nThe term $\\text{cov}(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{z})$ is the covariance matrix between breeding values and phenotypic values. Under the standard additive model of quantitative genetics, $\\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{e}$, where $\\mathbf{a}$ is the vector of breeding values and $\\mathbf{e}$ is the vector of environmental and non-additive genetic deviations, with $\\text{cov}(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{e}) = \\mathbf{0}$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\text{cov}(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{z}) = \\text{cov}(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{e}) = \\text{cov}(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{a}) + \\text{cov}(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{e}) = \\text{var}(\\mathbf{a}) = \\mathbf{G}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{G}$ is the additive genetic variance-covariance matrix. Substituting this into the equation for the response gives the multivariate breeder's equation:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\mathbf{G}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\n$$\nThis equation predicts the evolutionary change in the mean phenotype of the population. The term \"correlated response\" arises from the off-diagonal elements of $\\mathbf{G}$. Selection on one trait (a non-zero component of $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$) can cause a response in another trait if there is a non-zero additive genetic covariance between them.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values using the provided data.\nGiven:\n$$\n\\mathbf{P}=\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{S}=\\begin{pmatrix} 0.4 \\\\ 0.1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{G}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1.2 & 0.3 \\\\ 0.3 & 0.8 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFirst, calculate $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{S}$.

It is a well-posed, scientifically-grounded exercise in evolutionary quantitative genetics. The solution will proceed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe fundamental equation governing the per-generation evolutionary response of the trait means is the multivariate breeder's equation:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{G}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{R} = (R_1, R_2)^\\top$ is the vector of responses for traits $z_1$ and $z_2$, $\\mathbf{G}$ is the additive genetic variance-covariance matrix, and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = (\\beta_1, \\beta_2)^\\top$ is the vector of selection gradients on the traits.\n\n**Analysis of Regime 1 (Single-trait selection)**\n\nIn this regime, selection favors larger $z_1$ with no direct selection on $z_2$. This implies that the selection gradient for $z_1$ is positive, $\\beta_1 > 0$, and the selection gradient for $z_2$ is zero, $\\beta_2 = 0$. The selection gradient vector is therefore $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(1)} = (\\beta_1, 0)^\\top$ for some constant $\\beta_1 > 0$.\n\nThe response to selection is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}^{(1)} = \\mathbf{G}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(1)} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.0 & 0.6 \\\\\n0.6 & 1.0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\beta_1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.0 \\cdot \\beta_1 + 0.6 \\cdot 0 \\\\\n0.6 \\cdot \\beta_1 + 1.0 \\cdot 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\beta_1 \\\\\n0.6 \\beta_1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe response of trait $z_2$ is $R_2^{(1)} = 0.6 \\beta_1$. Since $\\beta_1 > 0$, the response $R_2^{(1)}$ is positive. Trait $z_2$ increases due to its positive genetic correlation with $z_1$.\n\n**Analysis of Regime 2 (Index selection)**\n\nIn this regime, selection acts on the index $I = 1.0 z_1 - 0.7 z_2$, favoring larger values of $I$. The problem states that the selection gradient vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is aligned with the index weight vector $\\mathbf{a} = (1.0, -0.7)^\\top$. This means $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(2)} = k \\cdot (1.0, -0.7)^\\top$ for some positive constant $k$ (since larger $I$ is favored). For determining the sign of the response, we can analyze the proportionality:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(2)} \\propto \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.0 \\\\\n-0.7\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe response to selection is proportional to:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}^{(2)} \\propto \\mathbf{G}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(2)} \\propto\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.0 & 0.6 \\\\\n0.6 & 1.0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.0 \\\\\n-0.7\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.0 \\cdot 1.0 + 0.6 \\cdot (-0.7) \\\\\n0.6 \\cdot 1.0 + 1.0 \\cdot (-0.7)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.0 - 0.42 \\\\\n0.6 - 0.7\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.58 \\\\\n-0.1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe response of trait $z_2$ is $R_2^{(2)} \\propto -0.1$. This response is negative.\n\n**Explanation of the Sign Reversal**\n\nThe response of $z_2$ under Regime $1$ is positive ($R_2^{(1)} > 0$), while under Regime $2$ it is negative ($R_2^{(2)} < 0$). The sign has reversed. The mechanism for this is revealed by examining the equation for $R_2$:\n$$\nR_2 = G_{21} \\beta_1 + G_{22} \\beta_2\n$$\n- In Regime $1$: $\\beta_1 > 0$ and $\\beta_2 = 0$. So, $R_2^{(1)} = G_{21}\\beta_1 = 0.6\\beta_1 > 0$. The response is entirely a positive correlated response.\n- In Regime $2$: $\\beta_1 \\propto 1.0$ and $\\beta_2 \\propto -0.7$. The total response $R_2$ is a sum of two components:\n    1. A positive correlated response due to selection on $z_1$: $G_{21}\\beta_1 \\propto 0.6 \\cdot (1.0) = 0.6$.\n    2. A negative direct response due to selection on $z_2$: $G_{22}\\beta_2 \\propto 1.0 \\cdot (-0.7) = -0.7$.\nThe total response is the sum of these effects: $R_2^{(2)} \\propto 0.6 - 0.7 = -0.1$. The sign reversal occurs because the negative selection gradient on $z_2$ (induced by the negative weight $a_2 = -0.7$) creates a direct selective pressure for $z_2$ to decrease. This negative effect ($-0.7$) is stronger than the positive indirect effect ($+0.6$) coming from the correlated response to selection on $z_1$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. This option states that in Regime $1$, $R_2 = G_{21}\\beta_1 = 0.6\\beta_1 > 0$. In Regime $2$, it correctly calculates that $R_2 \\propto 0.6 \\cdot 1.0 + 1.0 \\cdot (-0.7) = -0.1 < 0$. It then explains the reversal by stating that the direct negative component on $z_2$ (from $a_2 < 0$) outweighs the positive correlated response (from $G_{21} > 0$). This aligns perfectly with the derivation above, providing both the correct numerical illustration and conceptual explanation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. This option claims that a sign reversal is impossible when $G_{12} > 0$. The calculation for Regime $2$ provides a direct counterexample, demonstrating that a sign reversal is indeed possible. The response of a trait depends on the entire selection gradient, not just the sign of one element of the $\\mathbf{G}$ matrix.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. This option argues based on the formula $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\propto \\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{a}$. This contradicts the simplifying assumption explicitly given in the problem statement that $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\propto \\mathbf{a}$. One must solve the problem as stated. Furthermore, it makes an unsubstantiated claim that phenotypic covariances \"necessarily rotate\" the gradient to oppose genetic covariances, which is not a general rule. Finally, it introduces the matrix $\\mathbf{P}$, about which no information is given.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. This option claims the reversal requires negative environmental covariance. The derivation above shows the reversal occurs based entirely on the given $\\mathbf{G}$ matrix and the selection index weights. No information about environmental covariances was needed or used. The condition is not necessary.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2698970"}]}
