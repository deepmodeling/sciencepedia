Assume a purely additive, no-dominance, no-epistasis model with an environmental residual. By definition of additivity at a locus, the additive effect $a_{j}$ at locus $\\mathcal{L}_{j}$ is one-half of the difference between the two homozygote genotype means at that locus when genetic background is held constant, and the heterozygote mean at that locus equals the arithmetic mean of the two homozygote means.

The model is characterized by two unlinked loci, pure additivity within and between loci (no dominance, no epistasis), and an environmental residual with an expected value of zero.\n\nLet $E[Y | G]$ denote the expected phenotype for a given genotype $G$. The genotype is specified by the combination of alleles at two loci, $\\mathcal{L}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{2}$. Let the genotype at $\\mathcal{L}_{1}$ be $G_1 \\in \\{AA, Aa, aa\\}$ and at $\\mathcal{L}_{2}$ be $G_2 \\in \\{BB, Bb, bb\\}$.\n\nThe assumption of no epistasis implies that the contributions of the two loci to the phenotype are additive. We can express the expected phenotype as a sum of effects:\n$$E[Y | G_1, G_2] = M + c_1(G_1) + c_2(G_2)$$\nwhere $M$ is a constant base value, and $c_j(G_j)$ is the contribution of the genotype at locus $\\mathcal{L}_j$.\n\nTo formalize this model, we introduce coded variables for the genotypes. For locus $\\mathcal{L}_{1}$, let us define a variable $x_{1}$ such that:\n$$x_{1} = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{for genotype } AA \\\\ 0  \\text{for genotype } Aa \\\\ -1  \\text{for genotype } aa \\end{cases}$$\nSimilarly, for locus $\\mathcal{L}_{2}$, we define a variable $x_{2}$:\n$$x_{2} = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{for genotype } BB \\\\ 0  \\text{for genotype } Bb \\\\ -1  \\text{for genotype } bb \\end{cases}$$\nThe choice of $0$ for the heterozygote directly enforces the condition of no dominance, which states that the heterozygote's phenotypic value is the arithmetic mean of the two corresponding homozygotes. For example, for locus $\\mathcal{L}_{1}$, holding the background $G_2$ constant, the no-dominance condition is $E[Y|Aa, G_2] = \\frac{1}{2}(E[Y|AA, G_2] + E[Y|aa, G_2])$. A linear dependence on $x_1$ ensures this.\n\nWith these coded variables, the general additive model for the expected phenotype can be written as a linear function:\n$$E[Y | x_1, x_2] = \\mu_{model} + \\alpha_1 x_1 + \\alpha_2 x_2$$\nwhere $\\mu_{model}$ is the intercept and $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ are coefficients representing the effects of the loci. We must relate these model parameters to the parameters given in the problem: $\\mu$, $a_1$, and $a_2$.\n\nThe problem defines the additive effect $a_j$ at locus $\\mathcal{L}_j$ as one-half the difference between the phenotypic means of the two homozygotes. For locus $\\mathcal{L}_{1}$, this is:\n$$a_{1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( E[Y|AA, G_2] - E[Y|aa, G_2] \\right)$$\nUsing our linear model, and holding $G_2$ (and thus $x_2$) constant:\n$$E[Y|AA, G_2] = \\mu_{model} + \\alpha_1(1) + \\alpha_2 x_2$$\n$$E[Y|aa, G_2] = \\mu_{model} + \\alpha_1(-1) + \\alpha_2 x_2$$\nSubstituting these into the definition of $a_1$:\n$$a_{1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\mu_{model} + \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 x_2) - (\\mu_{model} - \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 x_2) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} (2\\alpha_1) = \\alpha_1$$\nThus, the model coefficient $\\alpha_1$ is precisely the additive effect $a_1$. By identical reasoning, $\\alpha_2 = a_2$.\n\nThe parameter $\\mu$ is defined as the \"intercept (baseline mean) for the trait under this model\". In our linear model, the intercept $\\mu_{model}$ is the value of the expression when $x_1=0$ and $x_2=0$. This corresponds to the genotype $(Aa, Bb)$. Therefore, it is proper to identify the problem's parameter $\\mu$ with our model's intercept $\\mu_{model}$:\n$$\\mu = \\mu_{model} = E[Y | x_1=0, x_2=0] = E[Y | Aa, Bb]$$\nThis interpretation is standard in quantitative genetics, where $\\mu$ often represents the phenotypic mean of the $F_1$ generation (genotype $AaBb$) and, as it happens, the grand mean of the $F_2$ population, since $E[x_1] = E[x_2] = 0$ in the $F_2$.\n\nWith these identifications, the model for the expected phenotype is:\n$$E[Y | G_1, G_2] = \\mu + a_{1}x_{1} + a_{2}x_{2}$$\nWe can now compute the expected phenotype for each of the nine genotypes by substituting the corresponding values of $x_1$ and $x_2$.\n\n1.

We use the provided linear model and the property that the expectation of the residual error is zero, $\\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon_i]=0$.\n\nFor an individual with genotype $\\mathrm{AA}$, the codings are $X_A=-1$ and $X_D=0$. The expected phenotype is:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{AA}} = \\mathbb{E}[y | \\text{genotype is AA}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mu + a(-1) + d(0) + \\varepsilon_i] = \\mu - a + \\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon_i] = \\mu - a\n$$\n\nFor an individual with genotype $\\mathrm{AB}$, the codings are $X_A=0$ and $X_D=1$. The expected phenotype is:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{AB}} = \\mathbb{E}[y | \\text{genotype is AB}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mu + a(0) + d(1) + \\varepsilon_i] = \\mu + d + \\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon_i] = \\mu + d\n$$\n\nFor an individual with genotype $\\mathrm{BB}$, the codings are $X_A=1$ and $X_D=0$. The expected phenotype is:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{BB}} = \\mathbb{E}[y | \\text{genotype is BB}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mu + a(1) + d(0) + \\varepsilon_i] = \\mu + a + \\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon_i] = \\mu + a\n$$\n\nThis establishes a system of three linear equations relating the expected genotypic values to the model parameters $\\mu$, $a$, and $d$:\n1.  $\\mu_{\\mathrm{AA}} = \\mu - a$\n2.  $\\mu_{\\mathrm{AB}} = \\mu + d$\n3.  $\\mu_{\\mathrm{BB}} = \\mu + a$\n\nThe principle of least squares seeks to find the parameter values that minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE), $SSE = \\sum_i (y_i - \\mathbb{E}[y_i])^2$. In this model, the individuals are partitioned into three distinct genotype groups. The total SSE can be decomposed into the sum of SSE for each group:\n$$\nSSE = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathrm{AA}} (y_i - \\mu_{\\mathrm{AA}})^2 + \\sum_{i \\in \\mathrm{AB}} (y_i - \\mu_{\\mathrm{AB}})^2 + \\sum_{i \\in \\mathrm{BB}} (y_i - \\mu_{\\mathrm{BB}})^2\n$$\nTo minimize the total $SSE$, one must minimize each term independently. The value of a group's theoretical mean (e.g., $\\mu_{\\mathrm{AA}}$) that minimizes that group's sum of squares is the sample mean of the observations in that group (e.g., $\\bar{y}_{\\mathrm{AA}}$). Therefore, the least-squares estimates for the genotypic means are the observed sample means:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{AA}} = \\bar{y}_{\\mathrm{AA}}, \\quad \\hat{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{AB}} = \\bar{y}_{\\mathrm{AB}}, \\quad \\hat{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{BB}} = \\bar{y}_{\\mathrm{BB}}\n$$\nBy the invariance property of least-squares estimators, the estimates for the re-parameterized parameters $(\\hat{\\mu}, \\hat{a}, \\hat{d})$ are found by solving the system of equations with these estimated genotypic values:\n1.  $\\hat{\\mu} - \\hat{a} = \\bar{y}_{\\mathrm{AA}}$\n2.  $\\hat{\\mu} + \\hat{d} = \\bar{y}_{\\mathrm{AB}}$\n3.  $\\hat{\\mu} + \\hat{a} = \\bar{y}_{\\mathrm{BB}}$\n\nWe now solve this system for $\\hat{a}$ and $\\hat{d}$.\nTo find $\\hat{a}$, subtract equation (1) from equation (3):\n$$\n(\\hat{\\mu} + \\hat{a}) - (\\hat{\\mu} - \\hat{a}) = \\bar{y}_{\\mathrm{BB}} - \\bar{y}_{\\mathrm{AA}}\n$$\n$$\n2\\hat{a} = \\bar{y}_{\\mathrm{BB}} - \\bar{y}_{\\mathrm{AA}}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{a} = \\frac{\\bar{y}_{\\mathrm{BB}} - \\bar{y}_{\\mathrm{AA}}}{2}\n$$\nTo find $\\hat{d}$, we first find $\\hat{\\mu}$.
