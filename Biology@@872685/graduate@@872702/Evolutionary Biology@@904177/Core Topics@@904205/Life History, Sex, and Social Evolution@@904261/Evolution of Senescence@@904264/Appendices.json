There are no factual unsoundness, non-formalizable concepts, or ill-posed structures.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A rigorous derivation of the solution follows.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Survivorship Function $l(x)$**\nThe analysis begins with the provided differential equation relating survivorship $l(x)$ to the hazard function $h(x)$:\n$$\nl^{\\prime}(x) = -h(x) l(x)\n$$\nThis equation can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{d l(x)}{dx} = -h(x) l(x)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation, which is also separable. We separate the variables by arranging all terms involving $l$ on one side and all terms involving $x$ on the other:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{l(x)} d l(x) = -h(x) dx\n$$\nTo find the function $l(x)$, we integrate both sides. The integral on the left is with respect to $l$, from the initial survivorship $l(0)$ to the survivorship at age $x$, $l(x)$. The integral on the right is with respect to a dummy variable of integration, say $u$, from age $0$ to age $x$.\n$$\n\\int_{l(0)}^{l(x)} \\frac{1}{l} dl = -\\int_0^x h(u) du\n$$\nThe left side evaluates to $\\left[ \\ln|l| \\right]_{l(0)}^{l(x)}$. Since survivorship is a probability, $l(x) \\in [0, 1]$, so we can drop the absolute value.\n$$\n\\ln(l(x)) - \\ln(l(0)) = -\\int_0^x h(u) du\n$$\nUsing the given initial condition $l(0) = 1$, we have $\\ln(l(0)) = \\ln(1) = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\ln(l(x)) = -\\int_0^x h(u) du\n$$\nExponentiating both sides yields the general solution for $l(x)$ in terms of the cumulative hazard:\n$$\nl(x) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^x h(u) du\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the specified Gompertz hazard function, $h(u) = a \\exp(bu)$, into the integral.\n$$\n\\int_0^x a \\exp(bu) du = a \\int_0^x \\exp(bu) du\n$$\nThe integral of the exponential function is straightforward:\n$$\na \\left[ \\frac{1}{b} \\exp(bu) \\right]_0^x = \\frac{a}{b} \\left( \\exp(bx) - \\exp(b \\cdot 0) \\right) = \\frac{a}{b} \\left( \\exp(bx) - 1 \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $l(x)$:\n$$\nl(x) = \\exp\\left( -\\frac{a}{b} (\\exp(bx) - 1) \\right)\n$$\nThis can be written in the final form:\n$$\nl(x) = \\exp\\left( \\frac{a}{b} (1 - \\exp(bx)) \\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the survivorship function under the Gompertz model.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Mortality Doubling Time $\\Delta$**\nThe mortality doubling time $\\Delta$ is defined by the equation $h(x+\\Delta) = 2 h(x)$. We are given $h(x) = a \\exp(bx)$. Substituting this functional form into the definition gives:\n$$\na \\exp(b(x+\\Delta)) = 2 \\cdot a \\exp(bx)\n$$\nSince $a > 0$, we can divide both sides by $a$.\n$$\n\\exp(b(x+\\Delta)) = 2 \\exp(bx)\n$$\nUsing the property of exponents $\\exp(u+v)=\\exp(u)\\exp(v)$, we rewrite the left side:\n$$\n\\exp(bx) \\exp(b\\Delta) = 2 \\exp(bx)\n$$\nFor any real $x$, $\\exp(bx) > 0$. Thus, we can divide both sides by $\\exp(bx)$, which isolates the term containing $\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\exp(b\\Delta) = 2\n$$\nTo solve for $\\Delta$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\ln(\\exp(b\\Delta)) = \\ln(2)\n$$\n$$\nb\\Delta = \\ln(2)\n$$\nGiven that $b > 0$, we can divide by $b$ to obtain the final expression for $\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{b}\n$$\nThe result is a constant that depends only on the parameter $b$, which represents the rate of exponential increase in mortality with age. This completes the second task.\nThe two derived expressions are compiled into the required matrix format for the final answer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\exp\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\left(1 - \\exp(bx)\\right)\\right) & \\frac{\\ln(2)}{b} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2709256"}, {"introduction": "While demographic models describe *how* mortality changes with age, evolutionary theory explains *why* it does.

We consider an individual currently at age $x$. Its future life spans from age $x$ to death.

In a population growing at a rate $r$, the total number of newborns at time $t$ is $\\exp(rt)$ times the number of newborns at time $0$. Therefore, the relative value of a newborn produced at time $t$ is discounted by a factor of $\\exp(-rt)$. This discount factor is $\\exp(-r(a-x))$.\n\n$4.$ Combining these elements, the expected, discounted contribution to future population growth from the age interval $[a, a+da]$ is the product of survival probability, offspring production, and the discount factor:\n$$ dV = \\left(\\frac{l(a)}{l(x)}\\right) \\cdot (m(a)da) \\cdot \\exp(-r(a-x)) $$\nTo find the total reproductive value $v(x)$, we must sum these infinitesimal contributions over all future ages, from the current age $x$ to the maximum possible age, which is taken as infinity.

The problem requires that this expression be normalized such that $v(0)=1$. We must verify if our derived expression satisfies this condition with the given information. Let us evaluate $v(0)$:\n$$ v(0) = \\frac{\\exp(r \\cdot 0)}{l(0)} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ra) l(a) m(a) da $$\nFrom the problem statement, we are given $l(0)=1$ and the Euler-Lotka equation, which states $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ra) l(a) m(a) da = 1$.
