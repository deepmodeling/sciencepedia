This practice is fundamental for building the mathematical intuition behind this unique form of social selection.", "problem": "In a haploid Wright–Fisher population with two alleles at a single locus, a green-beard allele $G$ encodes both a recognizable cue and a conditional social behavior: a bearer of $G$ helps a social partner if and only if the partner also bears $G$. The help imposes a cost $c \\ge 0$ on the actor and yields a benefit $b \\ge 0$ to the recipient. The alternative allele is denoted $\\neg G$. Assume the following life cycle and interaction structure:\n- Individuals are randomly paired for a single dyadic interaction each generation. In a dyad, each individual simultaneously plays the role of actor toward its partner and the role of recipient from its partner.\n- A $G$ actor helps only if its partner is $G$; a $\\neg G$ actor never helps any partner.\n- Payoffs are additive to a baseline fecundity: if an individual pays a cost it contributes $-c$ to its fecundity; if it receives help it contributes $+b$ to its fecundity; the baseline fecundity is $1$.\n- Reproduction follows Wright–Fisher sampling proportional to fecundity, with no mutation, migration, or genetic drift (deterministic limit).\n\nLet $p \\in [0,1]$ denote the frequency of $G$ prior to social interactions in a given generation.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of population genetics, specifically the Wright–Fisher model, and the theory of social evolution. The parameters and assumptions are clearly stated, free of contradiction or ambiguity, and are sufficient for a deterministic derivation. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a rigorous solution can be constructed.\n\nThe objective is to derive the one-generation change in the frequency of the green-beard allele $G$, denoted as $\\Delta p = p' - p$. Here, $p$ is the frequency of allele $G$ in the current generation, and $p'$ is its frequency in the subsequent generation.\n\nIn a deterministic Wright–Fisher model, the frequency of an allele in the next generation is given by the ratio of its average fecundity to the average fecundity of the entire population. For the haploid case, this is:\n$$p' = \\frac{p \\cdot w_G}{\\bar{w}}$$\nwhere $w_G$ is the average fecundity of individuals carrying the $G$ allele, and $\\bar{w}$ is the average fecundity of the population.\n\nFirst, we must determine the average fecundities, $w_G$ and $w_{\\neg G}$, for the two types of individuals. Fecundity is defined as a baseline value of $1$ plus any payoffs from social interactions. Individuals are paired randomly.\n\nLet us calculate $w_G$, the average fecundity of a $G$-bearing individual. A $G$ individual interacts with another $G$ individual with probability $p$, and with a $\\neg G$ individual with probability $1-p$.\n- **Scenario 1: Partner is $G$ (probability $p$)**\n  The focal $G$ individual helps its $G$ partner, incurring a cost $c$. Its payoff from acting is $-c$.\n  Simultaneously, its $G$ partner helps the focal individual, which receives a benefit $b$. Its payoff from being a recipient is $+b$.\n  The fecundity in this case is $f_{G|G} = 1 - c + b$.\n\n- **Scenario 2: Partner is $\\neg G$ (probability $1-p$)**\n  The focal $G$ individual does not help a $\\neg G$ partner. Its payoff from acting is $0$.\n  The $\\neg G$ partner never helps. Its payoff from being a recipient is $0$.\n  The fecundity in this case is $f_{G|\\neg G} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1$.\n\nThe average fecundity $w_G$ is the weighted average of these outcomes:\n$$w_G = p \\cdot f_{G|G} + (1-p) \\cdot f_{G|\\neg G}$$\n$$w_G = p(1 - c + b) + (1-p)(1)$$\n$$w_G = p - pc + pb + 1 - p$$\n$$w_G = 1 + p(b-c)$$\n\nNext, we calculate $w_{\\neg G}$, the average fecundity of a $\\neg G$-bearing individual. A $\\neg G$ individual interacts with a $G$ individual with probability $p$, and with another $\\neg G$ individual with probability $1-p$.\n- **Scenario 1: Partner is $G$ (probability $p$)**\n  The focal $\\neg G$ individual never helps. Its payoff from acting is $0$.\n  The $G$ partner helps only other $G$ individuals, not the focal $\\neg G$. Its payoff from being a recipient is $0$.\n  The fecundity is $f_{\\neg G|G} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1$.\n\n- **Scenario 2: Partner is $\\neg G$ (probability $1-p$)**\n  The focal $\\neg G$ individual never helps. Payoff from acting is $0$.\n  The $\\neg G$ partner never helps. Payoff from being a recipient is $0$.\n  The fecundity is $f_{\\neg G|\\neg G} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1$.\n\nThe average fecundity $w_{\\neg G}$ is:\n$$w_{\\neg G} = p \\cdot f_{\\neg G|G} + (1-p) \\cdot f_{\\neg G|\\neg G}$$\n$$w_{\\neg G} = p(1) + (1-p)(1) = 1$$\nThis result is logical: a $\\neg G$ individual neither provides nor receives help under any circumstance, so its fecundity is always the baseline value.\n\nNow, we compute the average fecundity of the population, $\\bar{w}$. This is the weighted average of the fecundities of the constituent types:\n$$\\bar{w} = p \\cdot w_G + (1-p) \\cdot w_{\\neg G}$$\n$$\\bar{w} = p(1 + p(b-c)) + (1-p)(1)$$\n$$\\bar{w} = p + p^2(b-c) + 1 - p$$\n$$\\bar{w} = 1 + p^2(b-c)$$\n\nWith these components, we can find $p'$:\n$$p' = \\frac{p \\cdot w_G}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{p(1 + p(b-c))}{1 + p^2(b-c)}$$\n\nFinally, we derive the change in allele frequency, $\\Delta p = p' - p$.\n$$\\Delta p = \\frac{p(1 + p(b-c))}{1 + p^2(b-c)} - p$$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator:\n$$\\Delta p = \\frac{p(1 + p(b-c)) - p(1 + p^2(b-c))}{1 + p^2(b-c)}$$\n$$\\Delta p = \\frac{p + p^2(b-c) - p - p^3(b-c)}{1 + p^2(b-c)}$$\n$$\\Delta p = \\frac{p^2(b-c) - p^3(b-c)}{1 + p^2(b-c)}$$\nFactoring the numerator gives the final expression:\n$$\\Delta p = \\frac{p^2(1-p)(b-c)}{1 + p^2(b-c)}$$\nThis expression correctly describes the one-generation change in the frequency of the green-beard allele. The sign of $\\Delta p$ is determined by the sign of $(b-c)$, indicating that the allele spreads if the benefit of cooperation exceeds its cost, consistent with Hamilton's rule for a relatedness of $1$, which is the case for green-beard recognition. The change is zero at the fixation points $p=0$ and $p=1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{p^2(1-p)(b-c)}{1 + p^2(b-c)}}$$", "id": "2720662"}, {"introduction": "Green-beard systems are famously fragile, and this practice explores their primary vulnerability: invasion by \"false-beards\" who display the signal without paying the cost of cooperation. This exercise [@problem_id:2720701] challenges you to model this evolutionary dynamic and demonstrates how such cheating strategies can lead to a rapid collapse of cooperation. Understanding this inherent instability is key to appreciating why green-beard effects, though theoretically potent, are thought to be rare in nature.", "problem": "A single genetic locus controls a green-beard system in a large, randomly mixing population. There are two alleles: a green-beard altruism allele $G$ and a false-beard allele $F$. Carriers of $G$ (i) express a conspicuous signal (the “beard”) and (ii) help any partner they perceive as bearing the signal, paying a cost $c>0$ to deliver a benefit $b>0$ to the partner. Carriers of $F$ express an indistinguishable signal but never help as donors. Each generation, every individual is a donor in one randomly paired interaction and a recipient in one randomly paired interaction. Payoffs add linearly to a baseline viability fitness, so expected fitness is baseline plus expected social payoff.\n\nSignal recognition is imperfect: when a donor of type $G$ encounters a recipient of type $G$, the signal is perceived with probability $\\rho \\in (0,1]$; when the recipient is of type $F$, the signal is perceived with probability $\\alpha \\in [0,1)$. Thus $\\rho$ measures the reliability of recognizing genuine green-beards, and $\\alpha$ measures the mimicry effectiveness of false-beards. In all cases, a donor of type $F$ never helps, irrespective of perceived signal.\n\nLet $x \\in [0,1]$ denote the frequency of allele $G$ in the population. Assume random matching, weak selection in the sense that payoffs map additively to expected fitness, and that demographic stochasticity can be neglected.\n\nTasks:\n1) Starting from first principles of expected fitness accounting under random interactions, derive the exact condition, in terms of $b$, $c$, $\\rho$, and $\\alpha$, under which the false-beard allele $F$ can increase in frequency when rare in a population initially fixed for $G$.\n\n2) Under the assumption that the invasion condition you derived in part (1) holds, determine the long-run evolutionary outcome for $x$. Using that outcome, compute the resulting equilibrium fraction of helping interactions $H_{\\infty}$ in the population, defined as the long-run probability that a random donor-recipient interaction results in help.\n\n3) Let $H_{0}$ denote the baseline fraction of helping interactions in a population fixed for $G$.

Do not include units. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for the magnitude of the decline in helping interactions, $\\Delta$, after a false-beard allele $F$ invades a population initially composed of green-beard altruists carrying allele $G$. To find this, we must first model the evolutionary dynamics of the system, determine the long-term equilibrium frequency of the alleles, and then calculate the corresponding change in the population-level helping rate.\n\nLet $x$ be the frequency of the allele $G$, and $1-x$ be the frequency of the allele $F$. We begin by deriving the expected fitness payoffs for individuals carrying each allele. The total social payoff, which we denote as $\\pi_I$ for an individual of allele type $I \\in \\{G, F\\}$, is the sum of payoffs received as a donor and as a recipient.\n\nThe expected social payoff for a carrier of allele $G$, $\\pi_G(x)$, is calculated as follows:\nAs a donor, a $G$ individual interacts with a random partner. The partner is of type $G$ with probability $x$ or type $F$ with probability $1-x$. A $G$ donor helps if it perceives the signal. The probability of perceiving the signal is $\\rho$ for a $G$ recipient and $\\alpha$ for an $F$ recipient. The cost of helping is $c$. The expected payoff as a donor is therefore $-c(x\\rho + (1-x)\\alpha)$.\nAs a recipient, a $G$ individual can only receive help from a $G$ donor. An interaction with a $G$ donor occurs with probability $x$. The $G$ donor helps with probability $\\rho$, providing a benefit $b$. An interaction with an $F$ donor (probability $1-x$) results in no help. The expected payoff as a recipient is thus $x(\\rho b) + (1-x)(0) = \\rho b x$.\nCombining these, the total expected social payoff for a $G$ carrier is:\n$$ \\pi_G(x) = \\rho b x - c(\\rho x + \\alpha(1-x)) $$\n\nThe expected social payoff for a carrier of allele $F$, $\\pi_F(x)$, is calculated as follows:\nAs a donor, an $F$ individual never helps, so its payoff as a donor is always $0$.\nAs a recipient, an $F$ individual interacts with a $G$ donor with probability $x$. The $G$ donor is deceived into helping with probability $\\alpha$, providing a benefit $b$. An interaction with an $F$ donor (probability $1-x$) results in no help. The expected payoff as a recipient is thus $x(\\alpha b) + (1-x)(0) = \\alpha b x$.\nThe total expected social payoff for an $F$ carrier is:\n$$ \\pi_F(x) = \\alpha b x $$\n\n**1) Condition for invasion of allele F**\nAllele $F$ can invade a population fixed for $G$ (i.e., when $x \\to 1$) if the fitness of a rare $F$ individual is greater than the fitness of a resident $G$ individual. We evaluate the payoffs at $x=1$:\n$$ \\pi_G(1) = \\rho b(1) - c(\\rho(1) + \\alpha(0)) = \\rho b - \\rho c = \\rho(b-c) $$\n$$ \\pi_F(1) = \\alpha b(1) = \\alpha b $$\nThe invasion condition is $\\pi_F(1) > \\pi_G(1)$, which is:\n$$ \\alpha b > \\rho(b-c) \\implies \\alpha b > \\rho b - \\rho c \\implies \\rho c > b(\\rho - \\alpha) $$\n\n**2) Long-run evolutionary outcome and equilibrium helping fraction $H_{\\infty}$**\nThe problem stipulates that we assume this invasion condition holds. The change in the frequency of allele $G$ is governed by the sign of the fitness difference, $\\Delta\\pi(x) = \\pi_G(x) - \\pi_F(x)$. Allele $G$ increases if $\\Delta\\pi(x) > 0$ and decreases if $\\Delta\\pi(x) < 0$.\n$$ \\Delta\\pi(x) = [\\rho b x - c(\\rho x + \\alpha(1-x))] - [\\alpha b x] $$\n$$ \\Delta\\pi(x) = \\rho b x - c\\rho x - c\\alpha + c\\alpha x - \\alpha b x $$\n$$ \\Delta\\pi(x) = x(\\rho b - c\\rho + c\\alpha - \\alpha b) - c\\alpha $$\n$$ \\Delta\\pi(x) = x((\\rho - \\alpha)b - (\\rho - \\alpha)c) - c\\alpha $$\n$$ \\Delta\\pi(x) = x(\\rho - \\alpha)(b-c) - c\\alpha $$\nThis fitness difference is a linear function of $x$. The evolutionary equilibria are the fixed points where the frequencies do not change, which are the boundaries $x=0$ and $x=1$, and any internal frequency $x^*$ where $\\Delta\\pi(x^*)=0$.\n\nLet's analyze the stability of the boundaries.\nThe state $x=0$ (fixation of $F$) is stable if an invading $G$ allele has lower fitness, i.e., $\\pi_G(0) < \\pi_F(0)$.\n$\\pi_G(0) = \\rho b(0) - c(\\rho(0) + \\alpha(1)) = -c\\alpha$.\n$\\pi_F(0) = \\alpha b(0) = 0$.\nSince $c>0$ and $\\alpha \\ge 0$, we have $\\pi_G(0) = -c\\alpha \\le 0 = \\pi_F(0)$. If $\\alpha>0$, the inequality is strict, so $x=0$ is always a stable equilibrium. If $\\alpha=0$, $G$ is neutral at the boundary.\n\nThe state $x=1$ (fixation of $G$) is unstable if the invading $F$ allele has higher fitness. The problem states we assume the invasion condition $\\pi_F(1) > \\pi_G(1)$ holds. This is equivalent to $\\Delta\\pi(1) < 0$.\n\nSo, we have a linear function $\\Delta\\pi(x)$ that is non-positive at $x=0$ (since $\\Delta\\pi(0) = -c\\alpha \\le 0$) and negative at $x=1$ (by the invasion assumption). A linear function that is non-positive at its endpoints must be non-positive throughout the interval $[0,1]$. If $\\alpha > 0$, $\\Delta\\pi(x) < 0$ for all $x \\in (0,1]$.\nThis means that for any mixed population ($x \\in (0,1)$), the fitness of a $G$ carrier is less than that of an $F$ carrier. Consequently, the frequency $x$ of the $G$ allele will always decrease, a process that only stops when $x$ reaches $0$.\nTherefore, under the assumption that allele $F$ can invade, the only long-run evolutionary outcome is the fixation of $F$. The equilibrium frequency of $G$ is $x_{\\infty} = 0$.\n\nThe fraction of helping interactions in the population, $H(x)$, is the probability that a random donor-recipient pair results in help. This requires the donor to be of type $G$ (probability $x$) and for this donor to act. The probability that a $G$ donor helps is $[x\\rho + (1-x)\\alpha]$. So,\n$$ H(x) = x[x\\rho + (1-x)\\alpha] $$\nThe long-run helping fraction, $H_{\\infty}$, is evaluated at the long-run equilibrium $x_{\\infty}=0$:\n$$ H_{\\infty} = H(x_{\\infty}=0) = 0[0\\rho + (1-0)\\alpha] = 0 $$\n\n**3) Calculation of the decline in helping, $\\Delta$**\n$H_0$ is the baseline fraction of helping interactions in a population fixed for $G$, i.e., at $x=1$:\n$$ H_0 = H(1) = 1[1\\rho + (1-1)\\alpha] = \\rho $$\nThe magnitude of the decline in helping is $\\Delta \\equiv H_0 - H_{\\infty}$. Using our results:\n$$ \\Delta = \\rho - 0 = \\rho $$\nThe final expression for the decline in helping is $\\rho$. This result is independent of $b$, $c$, and $\\alpha$, because the specified conditions (invasion by the cheating allele) lead to a complete collapse of cooperation, so the total decline is simply the initial level of cooperation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\rho}$$", "id": "2720701"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theoretical models to empirical investigation, this final practice challenges you to design a research program to uncover the genetic basis of a green-beard effect.

You can implement controlled matings, cross-fostering at birth, and high-density genotyping. You aim to estimate the additive genetic covariance between $C$ and $H$, denoted $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(C,H)$, and then to test whether any genetic association between these traits arises from pleiotropy at a single locus with effects on both traits or from physical linkage between distinct loci in linkage disequilibrium (LD).\n\nYour design must satisfy two goals grounded in fundamental quantitative genetics:\n\n- Estimation goal: Obtain an unbiased estimate of $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(C,H)$ by exploiting covariances among relatives, while controlling for common environmental effects and nonadditive genetic effects. You may assume standard definitions: phenotypic value $z$ decomposes into additive genetic, nonadditive genetic, and environmental components; additive genetic covariance between traits is defined as the covariance between their additive genetic values across individuals; paternal half-sib and full-sib designs can identify additive (co)variances through expected covariances among relatives; and mixed-effects “animal models” utilize the numerator relationship matrix to estimate additive (co)variances via restricted maximum likelihood (REML).\n\n- Causation goal: Discriminate pleiotropy versus close linkage. You may assume: pleiotropy means a single locus affects both $C$ and $H$; linkage means distinct loci affect $C$ and $H$ but are physically close and therefore correlated through LD. Under random mating, LD between loci separated by recombination fraction $r$ decays geometrically each generation. In contrast, a single pleiotropic locus cannot be separated by recombination into independent contributors to $C$ and $H$. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping can compare models in which one locus has effects on both traits versus models with two nearby loci each affecting one trait.\n\nWhich option below specifies a breeding and analysis design that, if implemented, would yield an unbiased estimate of $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(C,H)$ and a valid test between pleiotropy and linkage for the genetic association underlying a green-beard effect?\n\nA. Use a paternal half-sib/full-sib design with cross-fostering: each sire mates to multiple dams to generate paternal half-sibs nested within sires, with reciprocal cross-fostering of newborns to random dams to remove shared postnatal environment.

Then create an $F_2$ or advanced intercross panel from selected sires and dams, genotype dense markers, and perform bivariate QTL mapping to compare a pleiotropy model (one QTL with effects on both $C$ and $H$) versus a two-QTL linked model (distinct positions for $C$ and $H$) by likelihood ratio tests of nested models based on logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores. As an orthogonal test, propagate the intercross for $t$ generations under random mating and track the estimated $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(C,H)$; persistence despite recombination supports pleiotropy, while geometric decay with recombination fraction $r$ supports linkage.\n\nB. Sample a single cohort of unrelated individuals, measure $C$ and $H$, and fit a linear regression of $H$ on $C$ including measured environmental covariates. Use the residual correlation to infer $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(C,H)$ and declare pleiotropy if the correlation remains statistically significant after covariate adjustment.\n\nC.

The concepts of additive genetic covariance, pleiotropy, linkage, linkage disequilibrium, common environmental effects, cross-fostering, animal models, REML, and QTL mapping are all standard, well-defined, and central to the field. The proposed green-beard system provides a classic biological context for these questions.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The problem is exceptionally well-posed. It clearly articulates two separate but related goals (estimation and causal inference) and asks for a single, comprehensive design that can satisfy both. The distinction between pleiotropy and linkage is a classic and non-trivial problem in genetics, and the criteria for evaluating solutions are explicitly stated.\n*   **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and free of any subjective content.\n\nThe problem exhibits none of the invalidating flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, incomplete, contradictory, or trivial. It presents a sophisticated, realistic, and formalizable challenge in experimental design and genetic analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A detailed solution and evaluation of the options may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe optimal design must robustly address both the estimation and causation goals.\n\n**Addressing the Estimation Goal:** The primary challenge in estimating $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(C,H)$ is to statistically separate it from other sources of covariance, namely non-additive genetic covariance ($\\mathrm{Cov}_{NA}(C,H)$) and environmental covariance ($\\mathrm{Cov}_E(C,H)$). The total phenotypic covariance is $\\mathrm{Cov}_P(C,H) = \\mathrm{Cov}_G(C,H) + \\mathrm{Cov}_E(C,H) = \\mathrm{Cov}_A(C,H) + \\mathrm{Cov}_{NA}(C,H) + \\mathrm{Cov}_E(C,H)$. A key component of environmental covariance is the common environment effect, $\\mathrm{Cov}_{Ec}(C,H)$, shared by relatives raised together.\n\nTo obtain an unbiased estimate of $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(C,H)$:\n1.  **Control for Common Environment**: Cross-fostering, where offspring are moved to random foster mothers at birth, is the definitive method to break the statistical confounding between genetic relatedness and the shared maternal/natal environment. This allows for the separate estimation of genetic and common environmental effects.\n2.  **Separate Additive from Non-additive Genetic Effects**: Different types of relatives share different proportions of additive and non-additive genetic effects. For instance, the covariance between paternal half-sibs is due to $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the additive genetic (co)variance, whereas the covariance between full-sibs is due to $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the additive genetic (co)variance plus $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the dominance (co)variance. A breeding design that produces multiple types of relatives, such as a paternal half-sib/full-sib design (a \"North Carolina Design I\"), provides the necessary information to partition these components.\n3.  **Use a Powerful Statistical Model**: The \"animal model\" is the state-of-the-art method for this task. By using the entire pedigree to construct the numerator relationship matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, it leverages all available relationship information simultaneously. Fitting a bivariate mixed model for traits $C$ and $H$ with random additive genetic effects $\\mathbf{a}$ whose covariance structure is given by $\\mathbf{A} \\otimes \\mathbf{G}$ (where $\\mathbf{G}$ is the $2 \\times 2$ additive genetic covariance matrix) allows for the direct estimation of $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(C,H)$ as an element of $\\mathbf{G}$, typically via REML.\n\n**Addressing the Causation Goal:** The fundamental difference between pleiotropy and linkage lies in the effect of meiotic recombination. Recombination can separate linked loci but cannot split a single pleiotropic locus.\n1.  **Recombination-based mapping (QTL mapping)**: One must create a population with a history of recombination events, such as an $F_2$ population or an Advanced Intercross Line (AIL), derived from founders that differ in the traits of interest. AILs, created by intercrossing for multiple generations, accumulate more recombination events and thus offer higher mapping resolution. By genotyping this population with dense markers and measuring traits $C$ and $H$, one can perform bivariate QTL mapping. The critical test is to compare, at a genomic region showing association with both traits, the statistical fit of a model with a single QTL affecting both traits (pleiotropy) versus a model with two closely linked but distinct QTLs, one for each trait (linkage). This comparison is formally done using a likelihood ratio test, often expressed in terms of LOD scores.\n2.  **Recombination-based decay of LD**: If the genetic covariance is due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) between two loci, random mating will lead to recombination between them. The component of covariance due to LD is expected to decay at a rate determined by the recombination fraction $r$ between the loci, following $\\mathrm{Cov}_{A,LD}(t) \\propto (1-r)^t$. In contrast, if the covariance is due to pleiotropy, it is an inherent property of the allelic effects at a single locus and will not decay due to recombination (it will be stable, barring selection or drift). Therefore, creating an intercross population, maintaining it with random mating for several generations, and estimating $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(C,H)$ in each generation provides a powerful, independent test. A steady decay supports linkage; stability supports pleiotropy.\n\nA design that integrates these best-practice methods for both goals is required.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

Then create an $F_2$ or advanced intercross panel... perform bivariate QTL mapping... As an orthogonal test, propagate the intercross for $t$ generations... and track the estimated $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(C,H)$.**\n\n*   **Estimation Goal**: This option precisely specifies the gold-standard approach. The combination of a paternal half-sib/full-sib design, cross-fostering to control for common environmental effects, and analysis via a bivariate animal model with REML is the most rigorous method to obtain an unbiased estimate of $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(C,H)$. This part of the proposal is flawless.\n*   **Causation Goal**: This option proposes two complementary and powerful methods. First, it correctly identifies bivariate QTL mapping in a high-recombination population (like an AIL) as the primary tool to compare pleiotropy versus linkage models statistically. Second, it adds the elegant \"orthogonal test\" of tracking the covariance over time in a randomly mating population, which directly tests the fundamental prediction that covariance from linkage decays while covariance from pleiotropy does not. This is a comprehensive and rigorous strategy.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**. This option describes a complete and methodologically sound research program that perfectly addresses both goals of the problem using state-of-the-art techniques in quantitative genetics.\n\n**B. Sample a single cohort of unrelated individuals, measure $C$ and $H$, and fit a linear regression...**\n\n*   **Analysis**: This approach is fundamentally flawed. A simple regression of phenotypic values, even with covariate adjustment, cannot partition the observed phenotypic covariance into its genetic and environmental components, let alone separate additive from non-additive genetic covariance. The result would be a biased, uninterpretable estimate of $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(C,H)$. Furthermore, it offers no way to distinguish pleiotropy from linkage. A statistical correlation is expected under both scenarios.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Rear full-sib families in two contrasting environments and compute the correlation between family means...**\n\n*   **Analysis**: Using full-sib family means without a more complex design and analysis (like cross-fostering and an animal model) confounds additive genetic effects with common environmental effects and non-additive genetic effects. The logic for the causation goal is also incorrect: the stability of a correlation across environments relates to genotype-by-environment interaction ($G \\times E$), not to the underlying pleiotropy-versus-linkage architecture. A pleiotropic effect could be environment-dependent, and linkage disequilibrium could be stable across environments.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Establish divergent selection lines for $C$ only. After $10$ generations...measure the mean of $H$...**\n\n*   **Analysis**: This describes an artificial selection experiment. Observing a correlated response in trait $H$ when selecting on trait $C$ is a valid way to demonstrate the existence of a non-zero $\\mathrm{Cov}_A(C,H)$. However, this experiment does not provide an *estimate* of the covariance itself, failing the first goal. Critically, it also fails the second goal. A correlated response will occur whether the genetic basis is pleiotropy or linkage. The proposed inference—\"if $H$ has diverged... infer pleiotropy\"—is a logical error. While the correlated response might diminish over time under linkage due to recombination, a $10$-generation experiment is not designed to rigorously test this, and the option presents the mere existence of a correlated response as sufficient to rule out linkage, which is false.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn summary, only Option A presents a design that is theoretically sound and sufficiently comprehensive to meet both the estimation and causal inference goals set forth in the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2720676"}]}
