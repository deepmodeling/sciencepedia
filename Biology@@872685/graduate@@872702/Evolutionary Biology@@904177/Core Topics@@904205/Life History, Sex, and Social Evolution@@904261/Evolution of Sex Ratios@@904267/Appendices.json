By considering a parent's fitness as a function of their investment in sons versus daughters, we will derive R.A. Fisher's famous result from first principles. This practice demonstrates why, in a large, randomly mating population, natural selection favors equal *investment* in the two sexes, which only translates to an equal sex ratio by number if the costs of producing a son and a daughter are identical [@problem_id:2709671].", "problem": "A large, randomly mating, sexually reproducing population has maternal control of the primary sex ratio, defined as the fraction of zygotes that are male at conception. Assume equal mating opportunity among individuals of the same sex, no differential viability or fertility after birth beyond the sex-specific production costs, and that maternal investment is the sole limiting resource. Let the cost to produce one son be $c_m$ and the cost to produce one daughter be $c_f$, with costs measured in identical resource units. Each mother has a fixed budget $B$ and can continuously allocate a fraction $x$ of her budget to sons and the remainder $1-x$ to daughters.

Then, compute the ESS primary sex ratio by number when $c_m=2$ and $c_f=1$. Your final answer must be a single number.

Do not include units.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the condition for an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) for the primary sex ratio by number, denoted $p$, and for the computation of this ratio given specific costs for producing males and females. The analysis will be based on the principles of evolutionary game theory.\n\nA mother's evolutionary fitness is proportional to the total number of her grand-offspring. In a diploid, sexually reproducing population, every offspring results from the fusion of one male and one female gamete. Consequently, the total reproductive value of all males in a generation must equal the total reproductive value of all females in that generation. Let $N_m$ be the total number of males and $N_f$ be the total number of females in the population at reproductive age. Let the average reproductive value of a single male be $v_m$ and that of a single female be $v_f$. The equality of total reproductive values implies $N_m v_m = N_f v_f$. From this, we see that the reproductive value of an individual is inversely proportional to the frequency of its sex in the population, which is consistent with fact (i) from the problem statement. Specifically, $v_m \\propto \\frac{1}{N_m}$ and $v_f \\propto \\frac{1}{N_f}$.\n\nThe problem states that a mother has a fixed budget $B$ and allocates a fraction $x$ to sons and $1-x$ to daughters. The cost to produce one son is $c_m$, and the cost to produce one daughter is $c_f$. The number of sons a mother produces is $n_m = \\frac{xB}{c_m}$, and the number of daughters is $n_f = \\frac{(1-x)B}{c_f}$. Her fitness, $W$, is the sum of the reproductive values of her offspring:\n$$W = n_m v_m + n_f v_f = \\left(\\frac{xB}{c_m}\\right)v_m + \\left(\\frac{(1-x)B}{c_f}\\right)v_f$$\nThe values of $v_m$ and $v_f$ are determined by the population-wide sex ratio, which is set by the resident strategy, not the strategy of a single (potentially mutant) mother.\n\nAccording to fact (ii), an ESS is reached when the marginal fitness return per unit of investment is equalized across all possible investment choices. Here, the choices are investing in sons versus investing in daughters. The investment in sons is the budget portion $I_m = xB$, and the investment in daughters is $I_f = (1-x)B$.\n\nThe marginal fitness return from investing in sons is the derivative of the fitness component from sons, $n_m v_m$, with respect to the investment in sons, $I_m = xB$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial (n_m v_m)}{\\partial I_m} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (xB)} \\left(\\frac{xB}{c_m}v_m\\right) = \\frac{v_m}{c_m}$$\nSimilarly, the marginal fitness return from investing in daughters is the derivative of the fitness component from daughters, $n_f v_f$, with respect to the investment in daughters, $I_f = (1-x)B$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial (n_f v_f)}{\\partial I_f} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial ((1-x)B)} \\left(\\frac{(1-x)B}{c_f}v_f\\right) = \\frac{v_f}{c_f}$$\nAt the ESS, these marginal returns must be equal:\n$$\\frac{v_m}{c_m} = \\frac{v_f}{c_f}$$\nSubstituting the proportionality $v_m \\propto \\frac{1}{N_m}$ and $v_f \\propto \\frac{1}{N_f}$ (where the constant of proportionality is the same for both), we get:\n$$\\frac{1}{c_m N_m} = \\frac{1}{c_f N_f}$$\nThis simplifies to the central condition for an ESS population state, known as Fisher's principle:\n$c_m N_m = c_f N_f$\nThis condition states that at the ESS, the total parental investment in sons in the population must equal the total parental investment in daughters.\n\nThe problem asks for a condition on the primary sex ratio by number, $p$. By definition, $p = \\frac{N_m}{N_m + N_f}$, and the proportion of females is $1-p = \\frac{N_f}{N_m + N_f}$. We can express $N_m$ and $N_f$ in terms of $p$ and the total population size $N_{tot} = N_m + N_f$:\n$N_m = p N_{tot}$\n$N_f = (1-p) N_{tot}$\nSubstituting these expressions into the ESS condition $c_m N_m = c_f N_f$:\n$c_m (p N_{tot}) = c_f ((1-p) N_{tot})$\nSince $N_{tot}$ is non-zero, it can be cancelled from both sides, yielding the condition for the resident population primary sex ratio $p$ to be an ESS:\n$c_m p = c_f (1-p)$\nThis is the first part of the required derivation.\n\nTo compute the ESS primary sex ratio for the given costs, we solve this equation for $p$:\n$c_m p = c_f - c_f p$\n$c_m p + c_f p = c_f$\n$p(c_m + c_f) = c_f$\n$p = \\frac{c_f}{c_m + c_f}$\nThis is the general expression for the ESS primary sex ratio by number.\n\nThe problem provides the specific costs $c_m = 2$ and $c_f = 1$. Substituting these values into the expression for $p$:\n$p = \\frac{1}{2 + 1} = \\frac{1}{3}$\nThis is the ESS primary sex ratio by number. The population should be composed of one-third males and two-thirds females at conception. This result makes intuitive sense: because sons are twice as expensive to produce as daughters, the population stabilizes at a point where there are half as many sons as daughters, thereby equalizing the total parental investment in each sex. The answer is an exact rational number.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$$", "id": "2709671"}, {"introduction": "Fisher's principle rests on the assumption of random mating, where any male has a chance to mate with any female. This practice challenges that assumption by exploring the classic scenario of Local Mate Competition (LMC), where brothers compete for a limited pool of local mates (their sisters). By analyzing a simple, discrete brood, you will discover how this population structure leads to a dramatically female-biased optimal sex ratio, illustrating a powerful exception to the equal investment rule [@problem_id:2709690].", "problem": "A structured population consists of demes founded by a single inseminated female each generation, so that mating occurs entirely among her offspring before any dispersal. This is the canonical case of Local Mate Competition (LMC). Let $B \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $B \\ge 2$ denote the finite brood size (clutch size) produced by the foundress. She allocates $S \\in \\{0,1,2,\\ldots,B\\}$ of these $B$ offspring to be sons and $B-S$ to be daughters. Assume that males do not disperse or reproduce outside the natal deme and that each male has unlimited mating capacity. All daughters mate within the deme prior to dispersal, and only mated daughters disperse and contribute to the next generation. Assume random pairing among siblings conditional on availability of mates, so that when $S \\ge 1$, all $B-S$ daughters are mated; when $S=0$, no daughters are mated.\n\nUsing only these assumptions and the definition of expected mating opportunities for sons (i.e., when $S \\ge 1$, the expected number of matings per son equals $\\frac{B-S}{S}$ under random matching among siblings, and $0$ when $S=0$), derive from first principles the integer $S$ that maximizes the foundress’s expected number of mated daughters, and hence her expected gene transmission through daughters. State explicitly the optimal integer number of sons as a function of $B$, and provide a clear justification based on expected mating opportunities for sons. Your final answer must be the optimal integer number. No rounding is required, and no units are needed.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the optimal number of sons, $S$, that a foundress should produce in a brood of fixed size $B$ to maximize her expected number of mated daughters. The brood size $B$ is an integer such that $B \\ge 2$, and the number of sons $S$ is an integer in the set $\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, B\\}$.\n\nLet $N_d(S)$ denote the expected number of mated daughters as a function of the number of sons, $S$. The number of daughters in the brood is $B-S$. The problem statement provides the conditions for daughters being mated:\n1.  If $S=0$, there are no males in the brood, and hence no daughters can be mated. Therefore, $N_d(0) = 0$.\n2.  If $S \\ge 1$, at least one male is present. Given that males have unlimited mating capacity and mating occurs randomly among siblings, all $B-S$ daughters in the brood will be mated. Therefore, $N_d(S) = B-S$ for $S \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, B\\}$.\n\nCombining these two conditions, the objective function to be maximized is:\n$$\nN_d(S) = \\begin{cases} 0  \\text{if } S = 0 \\\\ B-S  \\text{if } S \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, B\\} \\end{cases}\n$$\nOur goal is to find the integer $S$ in the domain $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, B\\}$ that maximizes $N_d(S)$.\n\nWe begin by comparing the outcome for $S=0$ with the outcome for $S=1$.\nFor $S=0$, $N_d(0) = 0$.\nFor $S=1$, $N_d(1) = B-1$.\nAccording to the problem's givens, $B \\ge 2$, which implies that $B-1 \\ge 1$.\nThus, $N_d(1) = B-1 > 0 = N_d(0)$. This demonstrates that producing one son is a strictly better strategy than producing no sons. The optimal value of $S$ must therefore be greater than or equal to $1$.\n\nNext, we analyze the function $N_d(S)$ over the restricted domain $S \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, B\\}$. In this range, the function is given by $N_d(S) = B-S$. This is a linear function of $S$ with a slope of $-1$. Consequently, $N_d(S)$ is a strictly decreasing function of $S$ for $S \\ge 1$.\nThis means that for any two integers $S_1$ and $S_2$ such that $1 \\le S_1  S_2 \\le B$, the following inequality holds:\n$N_d(S_1) = B - S_1 > B - S_2 = N_d(S_2)$\nTherefore, within the domain $S \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, B\\}$, the function $N_d(S)$ achieves its maximum value at the smallest possible integer value of $S$, which is $S=1$.\n\nSince $S=1$ maximizes $N_d(S)$ for $S \\ge 1$, and we have already shown that the value at $S=1$ is greater than the value at $S=0$, we conclude that the global maximum of $N_d(S)$ over the entire domain $S \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, B\\}$ occurs at $S=1$.\n\nThe justification, framed in terms of expected mating opportunities for sons, is as follows. The foundress faces a trade-off in allocating her fixed reproductive investment, $B$, between sons and daughters. Her objective is to maximize the number of mated daughters.\nThe production of the first son (i.e., choosing $S=1$ instead of $S=0$) is essential. It transforms the outcome from $0$ mated daughters to $B-1$ mated daughters. This single son faces no competition from other males and is expected to secure all available matings within the brood, which number $B-1$. The expected number of matings for this son is $\\frac{B-1}{1} = B-1$.\n\nNow, consider the marginal effect of producing a second son (increasing $S$ from $1$ to $2$). This allocation decision comes at the direct cost of one daughter, reducing the number of daughters from $B-1$ to $B-2$. Consequently, the number of mated daughters also decreases to $B-2$. This second son provides no additional benefit to the foundress in terms of her stated objective, because the first son was already sufficient to fertilize all available daughters due to the assumption of unlimited mating capacity. Instead, the presence of a second son introduces competition. The two sons must now share the $B-2$ available matings, and the expected number of matings per son drops to $\\frac{B-2}{2}$.\n\nIn general, for any $S \\ge 1$, every additional son produced comes at the expense of one daughter. This directly reduces the number of mated daughters by one, from $B-S$ to $B-(S+1)$. The additional son only serves to increase the intensity of Local Mate Competition among the brothers for a shrinking pool of sisters, which is reflected in the decreasing value of the expected matings per son, $\\frac{B-S}{S}$, as $S$ increases. Since the objective is strictly to maximize the number of mated daughters, and any son beyond the first is detrimental to this goal, the optimal strategy for the foundress is to produce the absolute minimum number of sons required to ensure fertilization. This number is exactly one.\n\nThe optimal integer number of sons is therefore $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2709690"}, {"introduction": "Competition between relatives is a powerful selective force that can shape sex allocation in various ways.

If the population mean allocation to daughters is $y$, then the realized per-unit reproductive success of sons scales as $1/(1 - y)$ and that of daughters scales as $1/y$.\n- Local resource competition among daughters only: daughters incur an additional local competition cost on maternal fitness parameterized by $k  0$, while sons do not. Under linear returns, model this competition as a multiplicative devaluation of the daughter-side reproductive value by a factor $1/(1 + k)$, independent of $x$ and $y$.
