This exercise takes you back to first principles, asking you to derive the fundamental asymmetry at the heart of the conflict. By applying Hamilton's rule from the perspectives of both the parent and the offspring, you will demonstrate mathematically why the parent's optimal level of investment is inherently lower than the level that would maximize the offspring's own inclusive fitness [@problem_id:2740664].", "problem": "Consider a diploid, sexually reproducing species with no inbreeding. A single parent allocates a continuous investment amount $x \\ge 0$ to a focal offspring. The investment yields a benefit $b(x)$ to the focal offspring measured as an expected increase in the focal's number of surviving offspring equivalents, and it imposes a total cost $c(x)$ on the production and survival of all other offspring of the same parent, measured as an expected decrease in the parent's number of surviving non-focal offspring. Assume $b(x)$ is increasing and strictly concave, so that $b'(x) gt; 0$ and $b''(x) lt; 0$, and $c(x)$ is increasing and strictly convex, so that $c'(x) gt; 0$ and $c''(x) gt; 0$. Relatedness coefficients are defined in the standard sense of identity by descent.\n\nStart from first principles of inclusive fitness: the parent evaluates marginal effects on its inclusive fitness by weighting changes in descendants by its coefficient of relatedness to those descendants; the focal offspring evaluates marginal effects on its inclusive fitness by weighting changes in itself and in its siblings by its coefficients of relatedness to those individuals.\n\n1.

Do not approximate or round.", "solution": "The problem statement is critically reviewed and found to be valid. It is a well-posed problem grounded in established principles of evolutionary biology, specifically the theory of parent-offspring conflict. The assumptions are standard and sufficient for a unique solution. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of optimal investment from the perspectives of a parent and a focal offspring, based on the principles of inclusive fitness. Inclusive fitness of an individual is the sum of its own reproductive success (direct fitness) plus the effects of its actions on the reproductive success of its relatives, with each effect weighted by the appropriate coefficient of relatedness.\n\nPart 1: Parent's Optimal Investment\nThe parent's inclusive fitness, $W_{\\mathrm{P}}$, is affected by the investment $x$ in a focal offspring. This investment increases the focal offspring's fitness by $b(x)$ and decreases the fitness of the parent's other (non-focal) offspring by $c(x)$. The parent determines its optimal investment by maximizing its inclusive fitness.\n\nFrom the parent's perspective, the recipient of the benefit is the focal offspring, and the individuals bearing the cost are its other offspring. In a diploid, sexually reproducing species with no inbreeding, a parent's coefficient of relatedness to any of its offspring is $r_{\\mathrm{po}} = 1/2$. Let $r_{\\mathrm{pf}}$ be the relatedness of the parent to the focal offspring, and $r_{\\mathrm{pn}}$ be the relatedness to the non-focal offspring. We have $r_{\\mathrm{pf}} = r_{\\mathrm{pn}} = 1/2$.\n\nThe change in the parent's inclusive fitness due to a marginal change in investment $x$ is given by the sum of the weighted marginal effects on its descendants:\n$$\n\\frac{d W_{\\mathrm{P}}}{dx} = r_{\\mathrm{pf}} \\frac{db}{dx} - r_{\\mathrm{pn}} \\frac{dc}{dx} = r_{\\mathrm{pf}} b'(x) - r_{\\mathrm{pn}} c'(x)\n$$\nTo find the parent's optimal investment, $x_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}$, we set this derivative to zero:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{pf}} b'(x_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}) - r_{\\mathrm{pn}} c'(x_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}) = 0\n$$\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{pf}} b'(x_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}) = r_{\\mathrm{pn}} c'(x_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast})\n$$\nSince $r_{\\mathrm{pf}} = r_{\\mathrm{pn}} = 1/2$, these terms cancel, and the equation simplifies to:\n$$\nb'(x_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}) = c'(x_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast})\n$$\nThis is of the form $b'(x_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}) = \\lambda\\, c'(x_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast})$. Comparing the two, we identify $\\lambda$ as the ratio of relatedness coefficients:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{pn}}}{r_{\\mathrm{pf}}} = \\frac{1/2}{1/2} = 1\n$$\nThe condition $\\lambda=1$ reflects that the parent is equally related to all its offspring and therefore values a unit of benefit to one offspring equally to a unit of cost imposed on its other offspring. The assumptions that $b(x)$ is concave and $c(x)$ is convex ensure that the second-order condition for a maximum is met.\n\nPart 2: Offspring's Optimal Investment\nNow, we consider the same situation from the focal offspring's perspective. The focal offspring evaluates the trade-off based on its own inclusive fitness, $W_{\\mathrm{O}}$.\nThe investment $x$ provides a benefit $b(x)$ directly to the focal offspring. The offspring's relatedness to itself is $r_{\\mathrm{oo}} = 1$.\nThe cost $c(x)$ is borne by the focal offspring's siblings. A fraction $q$ of these are half-siblings (relatedness to focal, $r_{\\mathrm{ohs}} = 1/4$), and a fraction $1-q$ are full siblings (relatedness to focal, $r_{\\mathrm{ofs}} = 1/2$).\nThe average relatedness of the focal offspring to an individual among the group of siblings bearing the cost is:\n$$\n\\bar{r}_{\\mathrm{os}} = q \\cdot r_{\\mathrm{ohs}} + (1-q) \\cdot r_{\\mathrm{ofs}} = q \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) + (1-q) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{q + 2 - 2q}{4} = \\frac{2-q}{4}\n$$\nThe marginal change in the offspring's inclusive fitness is:\n$$\n\\frac{d W_{\\mathrm{O}}}{dx} = r_{\\mathrm{oo}} \\frac{db}{dx} - \\bar{r}_{\\mathrm{os}} \\frac{dc}{dx} = r_{\\mathrm{oo}} b'(x) - \\bar{r}_{\\mathrm{os}} c'(x)\n$$\nSetting this derivative to zero to find the offspring's optimal demand, $x_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{oo}} b'(x_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\ast}) - \\bar{r}_{\\mathrm{os}} c'(x_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\ast}) = 0\n$$\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{oo}} b'(x_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\ast}) = \\bar{r}_{\\mathrm{os}} c'(x_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\ast})\n$$\n$$\nb'(x_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\ast}) = \\frac{\\bar{r}_{\\mathrm{os}}}{r_{\\mathrm{oo}}} c'(x_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\ast})\n$$\nThis matches the form $b'(x_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\ast}) = \\mu\\, c'(x_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\ast})$, where $\\mu$ is the ratio of the offspring's relatedness to the individuals bearing the cost (its siblings) over its relatedness to the individual receiving the benefit (itself):\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{\\bar{r}_{\\mathrm{os}}}{r_{\\mathrm{oo}}} = \\frac{(2-q)/4}{1} = \\frac{2-q}{4}\n$$\nTo explain why $\\mu  \\lambda$, we compare $\\mu = (2-q)/4$ with $\\lambda = 1$. The variable $q$ is a fraction, so $q \\in [0,1]$.\nFor $q=0$, $\\mu = 2/4 = 1/2$. For $q=1$, $\\mu = 1/4$.\nFor any $q \\in [0,1]$, the value of $2-q$ is between $1$ and $2$, so $\\mu = (2-q)/4$ is between $1/4$ and $1/2$.\nThus, for all $q \\in [0,1]$, we have $\\mu \\le 1/2$. Since $\\lambda = 1$, it is always true that $\\mu  \\lambda$.\nThe brief explanation is that conflict arises from an asymmetry in relatedness. The focal offspring is more related to itself ($r_{\\mathrm{oo}}=1$) than to its siblings ($\\bar{r}_{\\mathrm{os}} \\le 1/2$), so it devalues the cost to its siblings relative to the benefit to itself. The parent, being equally related to all its offspring ($r_{\\mathrm{pf}}=r_{\\mathrm{pn}}=1/2$), values the benefit and cost equally from a genetic standpoint. This discrepancy in how the cost is valued leads to the offspring desiring a higher level of investment than the parent is evolutionarily selected to provide.\n\nPart 3: Calculation of the Ratio $R$\nWe are given specific functional forms: $b(x) = \\alpha \\ln(1+x)$ and $c(x) = \\delta x^{2}$. The derivatives are $b'(x) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+x}$ and $c'(x) = 2 \\delta x$.\n\nFor the parent's optimum $x_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}$, the first-order condition is $b'(x_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}) = c'(x_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast})$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha}{1+x_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}} = 2 \\delta x_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast} \\implies \\alpha = 2\\delta x_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}(1+x_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}) \\implies (x_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast})^2 + x_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast} - \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\delta} = 0\n$$\nSolving this quadratic equation for $x_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}$ and taking the positive root (since investment $x \\ge 0$):\n$$\nx_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(-\\frac{\\alpha}{2\\delta})}}{2} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1+\\frac{2\\alpha}{\\delta}}}{2}\n$$\nFor the offspring's optimum $x_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\ast}$, the first-order condition is $b'(x_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\ast}) = \\mu c'(x_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\ast})$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha}{1+x_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\ast}} = \\mu (2 \\delta x_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\ast}) \\implies \\alpha = 2\\delta\\mu x_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\ast}(1+x_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\ast}) \\implies (x_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\ast})^2 + x_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\ast} - \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\delta\\mu} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $x_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nx_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\ast} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(-\\frac{\\alpha}{2\\delta\\mu})}}{2} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1+\\frac{2\\alpha}{\\delta\\mu}}}{2}\n$$\nThe ratio $R$ is $x_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\ast} / x_{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1+\\frac{2\\alpha}{\\delta\\mu}}}{2}}{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1+\\frac{2\\alpha}{\\delta}}}{2}} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1+\\frac{2\\alpha}{\\delta\\mu}}}{-1 + \\sqrt{1+\\frac{2\\alpha}{\\delta}}}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute $\\mu = \\frac{2-q}{4}$ into the expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1+\\frac{2\\alpha}{\\delta\\left(\\frac{2-q}{4}\\right)}}}{-1 + \\sqrt{1+\\frac{2\\alpha}{\\delta}}} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1+\\frac{8\\alpha}{\\delta(2-q)}}}{-1 + \\sqrt{1+\\frac{2\\alpha}{\\delta}}}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the ratio $R$ in terms of $\\alpha$, $\\delta$, and $q$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{8\\alpha}{\\delta(2-q)}}}{-1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2\\alpha}{\\delta}}}}$$", "id": "2740664"}, {"introduction": "While the foundational model establishes the existence of conflict, its intensity is not constant; it is modulated by ecological and life-history factors.

Pooling-on-quiet equilibrium: both types choose $s=\\text{Quiet}$.\n\n- Parent’s sequential rationality after observing $s=\\text{Quiet}$: By Bayes’ rule, $\\mu(H \\mid \\text{Quiet})=p$ and $\\mu(L \\mid \\text{Quiet})=1-p$. The expected inclusive fitness from feeding is $p R_{H} + (1-p) R_{L}$. Sequential rationality requires withholding if and only if\n$$\np R_{H} + (1-p) R_{L} \\leq 0.\n$$\n\n- Offspring’s incentive compatibility: If the parent withholds after $s=\\text{Quiet}$, deviating to $s=\\text{Beg}$ must not be profitable given the parent’s off-path response after $s=\\text{Beg}$. A sufficient condition is that the parent would withhold after $s=\\text{Beg}$ as well (for instance, if $p R_{H} + (1-p) R_{L} \\leq 0$ and beliefs do not change), in which case deviating yields payoff $-k(d) \\leq 0$. Alternatively, if the parent would feed after $s=\\text{Beg}$, then incentives require\n$$\nb(H) - k(H) \\leq 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b(L) - k(L) \\leq 0,\n$$\nso that neither type benefits from deviation. Under either sufficient condition and parental withholding upon $s=\\text{Quiet}$, a pooling-on-quiet PBE exists.\n\nThe requested calculation is the critical prior $p^{\\ast}$ under pooling on $s=\\text{Beg}$ at which the parent is indifferent between feeding and withholding. From the indifference condition $p^{\\ast} R_{H} + (1-p^{\\ast}) R_{L} = 0$, we obtain the closed-form expression\n$$\np^{\\ast} = \\frac{-R_{L}}{R_{H} - R_{L}}.\n$$\nThis expression depends only on the parent’s inclusive fitness effects $R_{H}$ and $R_{L}$ and is well-defined because $R_{H} - R_{L}  0$ given $R_{H}  0  R_{L}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{-R_{L}}{R_{H} - R_{L}}}$$", "id": "2740651"}]}
