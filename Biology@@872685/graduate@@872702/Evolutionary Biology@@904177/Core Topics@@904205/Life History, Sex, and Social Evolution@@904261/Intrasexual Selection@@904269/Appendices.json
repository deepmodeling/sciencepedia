This practice guides you through the derivation of two cornerstone metrics in sexual selection theory: the opportunity for sexual selection ($I_s$), which measures the variance in relative mating success, and the sex-specific Bateman gradient ($\\beta_{ss}$), which quantifies the fitness benefit of obtaining additional mates. By deriving these from first principles using a hypothetical dataset, you will gain a deeper understanding of how variation in reproductive success provides the raw material for intrasexual selection to act upon. [@problem_id:2727284]", "problem": "You are studying intrasexual selection in a sex where individuals compete for mates. Let mating success be the random variable $m$ (number of mates secured by an individual during a breeding episode), with sample mean $\\bar{m}=2.0$ and sample variance $\\mathrm{Var}(m)=3.0$. Individual reproductive success (absolute fitness) is modeled as $w=1+0.8\\,m+\\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon$ is a mean-zero residual representing stochastic demographic noise with a Poisson error structure around the linear mean. Assume that $m$ and $\\varepsilon$ are independent and that the regression specification is correctly specified for the conditional mean of $w$ given $m$.\n\nStarting only from core definitions in sexual selection theory and regression, and without invoking any pre-packaged formulas, do the following:\n\n1) Define relative mating success $\\tilde{m}$ and relative fitness $\\tilde{w}$, and from first principles derive the opportunity for sexual selection $I_{s}$ as the variance in relative mating success. Then compute $I_{s}$ from the supplied summary statistics.\n\n2) Define the sex-specific Bateman gradient $\\beta_{ss}$ as the slope of the linear regression of relative fitness on relative mating success within the focal sex. Starting from the given model for the conditional mean of $w$ and the definitions of relative quantities, derive an expression for $\\beta_{ss}$ in terms of regression and sample moments and compute its numerical value from the supplied information.\n\nState any assumptions you require explicitly and justify each algebraic step from basic statistical identities, such as properties of expectation, variance under scaling, and the relation between linear regression slopes and conditional expectations.

It is based on established principles of evolutionary biology, specifically the quantitative analysis of sexual selection. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities that would prevent a rigorous, unique solution. The problem requires derivation from first principles rather than application of a pre-packaged formula, which is a valid academic exercise. I will therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe primary assumption is that the provided sample moments, the mean $\\bar{m}$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}(m)$, are taken as the true parameters of the underlying distributions for the purpose of this analysis. All derivations will rely on fundamental statistical identities.\n\nPart 1: The Opportunity for Sexual Selection, $I_{s}$\n\nFirst, we define the relative quantities. Relative mating success, $\\tilde{m}$, is an individual's mating success, $m$, scaled by the mean mating success of the sex, $\\bar{m}$.\n$$ \\tilde{m} = \\frac{m}{\\bar{m}} $$\nSimilarly, relative fitness, $\\tilde{w}$, is an individual's fitness, $w$, scaled by the mean fitness of the sex, $\\bar{w}$.\n$$ \\tilde{w} = \\frac{w}{\\bar{w}} $$\nThe opportunity for sexual selection, $I_{s}$, is defined as the variance in relative mating success.\n$$ I_{s} = \\mathrm{Var}(\\tilde{m}) $$\nWe derive an expression for $I_{s}$ from this definition. Using the property of variance under scaling, $\\mathrm{Var}(aX) = a^2 \\mathrm{Var}(X)$, where $a$ is a constant. In this context, $\\bar{m}$ is a constant scalar for the population sample.\n$$ I_{s} = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{m}{\\bar{m}}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{m}}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(m) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(m)}{\\bar{m}^2} $$\nThe problem provides the values $\\bar{m} = 2.0$ and $\\mathrm{Var}(m) = 3.0$. Substituting these into the derived expression:\n$$ I_{s} = \\frac{3.0}{(2.0)^2} = \\frac{3.0}{4.0} = 0.75 $$\nAs a dimensionless decimal with four significant figures, this is $0.7500$.\n\nPart 2: The Sex-Specific Bateman Gradient, $\\beta_{ss}$\n\nThe sex-specific Bateman gradient, $\\beta_{ss}$, is defined as the slope of the linear regression of relative fitness, $\\tilde{w}$, on relative mating success, $\\tilde{m}$. The formula for a simple linear regression slope is the covariance of the two variables divided by the variance of the predictor variable.\n$$ \\beta_{ss} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(\\tilde{m}, \\tilde{w})}{\\mathrm{Var}(\\tilde{m})} $$\nThe denominator is the opportunity for sexual selection, $I_{s}$, which we have already derived.\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\tilde{m}) = I_{s} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(m)}{\\bar{m}^2} $$\nWe must now derive an expression for the numerator, $\\mathrm{Cov}(\\tilde{m}, \\tilde{w})$. Using the property $\\mathrm{Cov}(aX, bY) = ab \\, \\mathrm{Cov}(X, Y)$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Cov}(\\tilde{m}, \\tilde{w}) = \\mathrm{Cov}\\left(\\frac{m}{\\bar{m}}, \\frac{w}{\\bar{w}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\bar{m}\\bar{w}} \\mathrm{Cov}(m, w) $$\nTo proceed, we need expressions for $\\bar{w}$ and $\\mathrm{Cov}(m, w)$.\nThe model for absolute fitness is $w = 1 + 0.8m + \\varepsilon$. Mean fitness, $\\bar{w}$, is the expectation of $w$.\n$$ \\bar{w} = E[w] = E[1 + 0.8m + \\varepsilon] $$\nBy the linearity of expectation:\n$$ \\bar{w} = E[1] + 0.8E[m] + E[\\varepsilon] $$\nGiven that $\\varepsilon$ is a mean-zero residual, $E[\\varepsilon]=0$. We use the sample mean $\\bar{m}$ as the estimator for $E[m]$.\n$$ \\bar{w} = 1 + 0.8\\bar{m} $$\nNext, we determine $\\mathrm{Cov}(m, w)$.\n$$ \\mathrm{Cov}(m, w) = \\mathrm{Cov}(m, 1 + 0.8m + \\varepsilon) $$\nUsing the property of bilinearity of covariance:\n$$ \\mathrm{Cov}(m, w) = \\mathrm{Cov}(m, 1) + \\mathrm{Cov}(m, 0.8m) + \\mathrm{Cov}(m, \\varepsilon) $$\nThe covariance with a constant is zero, so $\\mathrm{Cov}(m, 1) = 0$. The covariance of a variable with a scaled version of itself is $\\mathrm{Cov}(m, 0.8m) = 0.8\\mathrm{Cov}(m,m) = 0.8\\mathrm{Var}(m)$. The problem states that $m$ and $\\varepsilon$ are independent random variables. A critical property of independence is that the covariance between independent variables is zero. Therefore, $\\mathrm{Cov}(m, \\varepsilon) = 0$.\nCombining these results gives:\n$$ \\mathrm{Cov}(m, w) = 0.8\\mathrm{Var}(m) $$\nNote that the information regarding the Poisson error structure of $\\varepsilon$ implies heteroscedasticity, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon|m) = 1+0.8m$, which is important for assessing the precision of the regression slope but does not affect the calculation of the slope's point estimate itself, as shown here.\n\nNow we assemble the expression for $\\beta_{ss}$:\n$$ \\beta_{ss} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(\\tilde{m}, \\tilde{w})}{\\mathrm{Var}(\\tilde{m})} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\bar{m}\\bar{w}} \\mathrm{Cov}(m, w)}{\\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(m)}{\\bar{m}^2}} = \\frac{\\bar{m}}{\\bar{w}} \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(m, w)}{\\mathrm{Var}(m)} $$\nSubstituting our expressions for $\\mathrm{Cov}(m, w)$ and $\\bar{w}$:\n$$ \\beta_{ss} = \\frac{\\bar{m}}{1 + 0.8\\bar{m}} \\frac{0.8\\mathrm{Var}(m)}{\\mathrm{Var}(m)} $$\nThe $\\mathrm{Var}(m)$ terms cancel, provided $\\mathrm{Var}(m) \\neq 0$, which is true since $\\mathrm{Var}(m)=3.0$. This yields the final derived expression for the Bateman gradient:\n$$ \\beta_{ss} = \\frac{0.8\\bar{m}}{1 + 0.8\\bar{m}} $$\nFinally, we compute the numerical value using $\\bar{m} = 2.0$:\n$$ \\beta_{ss} = \\frac{0.8(2.0)}{1 + 0.8(2.0)} = \\frac{1.6}{1 + 1.6} = \\frac{1.6}{2.6} = \\frac{16}{26} = \\frac{8}{13} $$\nAs a dimensionless decimal, this is approximately $0.6153846...$.
