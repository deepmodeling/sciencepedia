## Introduction
Intrasexual selection, a cornerstone of Charles Darwin's theory of sexual selection, describes the [evolutionary process](@entry_id:175749) driven by competition among individuals of the same sex for access to mates. This powerful selective force is responsible for some of the most striking and often extreme traits in the natural world, from the enormous antlers of a stag to the complex social strategies of primates. But beyond these conspicuous examples lies a deeper set of principles governing how this competition unfolds, how its outcomes are determined, and what its broader evolutionary consequences are. The central challenge is to understand the diverse mechanisms through which individuals compete and how these strategies are shaped by ecological, social, and physiological constraints.

This article provides a graduate-level exploration of intrasexual selection, moving from foundational theory to modern applications. We will begin in the first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, by delineating the causal foundations of intrasexual selection, distinguishing it from natural and [intersexual selection](@entry_id:174974). We will explore the ecological context of competition, its quantitative measurement, and the array of pre- and post-copulatory strategies, from direct contests to [sperm competition](@entry_id:269032). The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, will demonstrate the far-reaching explanatory power of this theory, showing how it informs our understanding of social structures, [physiological trade-offs](@entry_id:175466), coevolutionary arms races, and even macroevolutionary patterns. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** chapter offers practical exercises for applying key quantitative frameworks, allowing you to model and analyze the dynamics of intrasexual competition.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Intrasexual selection, a concept first articulated by Charles Darwin, refers to the component of evolutionary selection arising from competition among individuals of one sex (typically males) for access to mates or the resources required for mating. This competition is a direct consequence of [anisogamy](@entry_id:152223) and the resulting divergence in [reproductive strategies](@entry_id:261553), where the sex investing less per gamete often experiences greater variance in reproductive success. This chapter delineates the core principles that govern intrasexual selection, explores the diverse mechanisms through which it operates, and quantifies its evolutionary impact.

### The Causal Foundations of Intrasexual Selection

To understand intrasexual selection with rigor, we must first distinguish it from both natural selection and its counterpart, [intersexual selection](@entry_id:174974). The demarcation lies in the specific causal pathway by which a trait influences an individual's [reproductive success](@entry_id:166712).

A trait is subject to **natural selection** if it affects fitness through components like survival or baseline fecundity (i.e., reproductive output independent of mating success). In contrast, a trait is subject to **sexual selection** if its effects on fitness are mediated through success in obtaining mates. This distinction can become subtle when a single resource or behavior influences both survival and mating. Consider a fish species where males compete for [algae](@entry_id:193252)-rich rock shelves. These shelves confer a dual benefit: they provide refuge from predators (a survival benefit) and are preferred oviposition sites for females (a mating benefit). A male trait, such as jaw leverage used in contests, that increases the probability of securing a shelf is thus under both natural and sexual selection. To disentangle these forces empirically, one must isolate the causal pathways. The component of selection is defined as intrasexual sexual selection if, after holding the survival benefits of the shelf constant, shelf possession still leads to higher mating success. Conversely, it is natural selection if, after holding mating opportunities constant, shelf possession leads to higher survival [@problem_id:2727319].

Within [sexual selection](@entry_id:138426), the distinction between **intrasexual selection** and **[intersexual selection](@entry_id:174974)** ([mate choice](@entry_id:273152)) is also one of causal mechanism. Intrasexual selection operates through within-sex competitive interactions that determine access to mates. Intersexual selection operates through the preferences of the opposite sex, which bias mating success among those who have gained access. Using a quantitative framework based on the Price equation, where selection on a trait $z$ is given by the covariance between the trait and [relative fitness](@entry_id:153028), $\mathrm{Cov}(w/\bar{w}, z)$, we can formalize this. If we consider mating success, $m$, as the primary component of fitness affected by pre-copulatory sexual selection, then intrasexual selection is the component of selection on $z$ that arises from the causal effect of contests on mating access. It creates variance in fitness via the pathway: $z \rightarrow \text{contest outcome} \rightarrow m \rightarrow w$. Intersexual selection, conversely, is the component arising from the causal effect of mate preference, following the pathway: $z \rightarrow \text{preference response} \rightarrow m \rightarrow w$. These two processes are conceptually distinct, even if they are statistically correlated (e.g., when females prefer the winners of male contests) [@problem_id:2727283].

### The Ecological Context and Quantitative Measurement

The intensity of intrasexual competition is not a fixed property of a species but is highly sensitive to the ecological and demographic context. A key parameter governing this intensity is the **Operational Sex Ratio (OSR)**, defined as the ratio of sexually active males to receptive females at a given time. A biased OSR, typically with a surplus of males, means that for every receptive female, there are multiple competing males, thus intensifying competition.

We can model the effect of OSR on the rate of competitive encounters using a simple mass-[action principle](@entry_id:154742). Let $M$ be the number of sexually active males and $F$ be the number of receptive females, with the total population size of active individuals fixed at $S = M + F$. The OSR is $r = M/F$. If individuals mix randomly, the rate of encounters between any two groups is proportional to the product of their densities. The rate of male-male competitive encounters will be proportional to $M^2$, while the rate of female-female encounters will be proportional to $F^2$. By expressing $M$ and $F$ in terms of $S$ and $r$ (specifically, $M = rS/(1+r)$ and $F = S/(1+r)$), we find that the total rate of same-sex competitive interactions scales with $\frac{r^2 + 1}{(1+r)^2}$. A [mathematical analysis](@entry_id:139664) reveals that this function is minimized when $r=1$, i.e., when the OSR is unbiased. Any deviation from a $1:1$ ratio of competing males to females increases the total rate of same-sex encounters, thereby increasing the potential intensity of intrasexual selection [@problem_id:2727263].

While the OSR sets the stage for competition, the strength of [sexual selection](@entry_id:138426) is formally quantified by the relationship between mating success and reproductive success. The **Bateman gradient**, denoted $\beta_{ss}$, captures this relationship. It is defined as the slope of a regression of relative reproductive success ($r_i = R_i/\bar{R}$) on relative mating success ($m_i = M_i/\bar{M}$). A steep Bateman gradient signifies that even small advantages in securing mates translate into large gains in [relative fitness](@entry_id:153028), indicating strong sexual selection.

The [selection differential](@entry_id:276336) on a trait $z$ that affects mating success, $S_z = \operatorname{Cov}(r, z)$, can be decomposed as $S_z = \beta_{ss} \gamma \operatorname{Var}(z)$, where $\gamma$ is the effect of the trait on mating success and $\operatorname{Var}(z)$ is the trait's variance. Here, $\beta_{ss}$ acts as a conversion factor, translating the immediate success in competition (measured by $\gamma$) into an evolutionary consequence ([selection differential](@entry_id:276336) $S_z$) [@problem_id:2727287]. For instance, given data where mean mating success $\bar{M}=1.5$, mean [reproductive success](@entry_id:166712) $\bar{R}=12.0$, $\operatorname{Var}(M)=2.0$, and $\operatorname{Cov}(M,R)=6.0$, the Bateman gradient can be calculated as $\beta_{ss} = (\operatorname{Cov}(M, R)/\operatorname{Var}(M)) \times (\bar{M}/\bar{R}) = (6.0/2.0) \times (1.5/12.0) = 0.375$. This value quantifies the marginal gain in [relative fitness](@entry_id:153028) for a marginal increase in relative mating success.

### Mechanisms of Pre-Copulatory Competition

Intrasexual competition before mating manifests in a variety of forms, which can be broadly categorized based on the nature of the interaction between competitors.

#### Contests versus Scrambles

The most fundamental distinction is between **[contest competition](@entry_id:178312)** and **[scramble competition](@entry_id:164371)**. Contest competition involves direct, often aggressive, interactions where some individuals are able to exclude others from a resource. The resource, such as a territory or a receptive female, must be economically defendable. Success in contests is primarily determined by an individual's fighting ability or **Resource Holding Potential (RHP)**. This mode of competition typically generates high variance in mating success, as a few dominant individuals monopolize matings.

In contrast, **[scramble competition](@entry_id:164371)** is an indirect race to find and secure mates that are not economically defendable, such as females that are widely dispersed and have short, unpredictable receptivity periods. Success is determined not by fighting ability, but by search efficiency, speed, and persistence. In a formal model where male success depends on both a competitive ability trait ($w_i$) and a search rate trait ($\lambda_i$), [contest competition](@entry_id:178312) is the scenario where success depends on $w_i$, while [scramble competition](@entry_id:164371) is where success depends on $\lambda_i$. Variance in mating success under a scramble regime arises from the [order statistics](@entry_id:266649) of arrival times: some males, by virtue of a high search rate or simple luck, find females quickly, while others may find none at all, leading to a [skewed distribution](@entry_id:175811) of matings [@problem_id:2727266].

#### The Logic of Contests: Assessment and RHP

In [contest competition](@entry_id:178312), fights are often costly. Evolutionary game theory predicts that individuals should employ assessment strategies to decide whether to escalate a contest or retreat. **Resource Holding Potential (RHP)** is a composite measure of an individual's intrinsic ability to win a contest, encompassing factors like size, strength, weaponry, and physiological condition.

Two primary classes of assessment models explain contest dynamics:
1.  **Self-assessment models**: Here, a contestant continues to fight until it reaches an internal threshold of costs, which is determined by its own RHP and the value of the resource. It does not assess its opponent's ability. The contest ends when the individual with the lower threshold (the eventual loser) gives up. A key prediction of this model is that contest duration should be primarily determined by the RHP of the loser—a stronger loser will endure more costs and thus prolong the fight.
2.  **Mutual assessment models**: In these models, contestants attempt to assess their RHP relative to their opponent's. The decision to persist depends on the perceived asymmetry. Contests between closely matched individuals are predicted to be longer and more escalated, as uncertainty about the outcome is high. Conversely, when there is a large asymmetry in RHP, the weaker individual is expected to retreat quickly, leading to a short contest. Therefore, this model predicts that contest duration will be inversely correlated with the difference in RHP between the two contestants [@problem_id:2727299].

#### Alternative Reproductive Tactics

In many species, not all males within a population employ the same competitive tactic. These **Alternative Reproductive Tactics (ARTs)** are discrete phenotypic strategies used to obtain fertilizations. A classic example is a fish species with large, territorial "guarder" males and small, non-territorial "sneaker" males that attempt to steal fertilizations.

Two main evolutionary models account for the existence of ARTs:
1.  **Conditional Strategy**: This model posits that all individuals share the same genetic decision rule, but express different tactics based on their condition (e.g., body size, age, or social status). An individual adopts the tactic that yields the highest fitness payoff *given its condition*. Typically, individuals in high condition adopt the primary tactic (e.g., guarding), while those in low condition adopt a secondary, "best of a bad job" tactic (e.g., sneaking). A key prediction is that the average fitness of individuals performing the primary tactic will be higher than that of those performing the secondary tactic. The [evolutionary stability](@entry_id:201102) of the strategy hinges on the existence of a "switch-point" in condition where the fitness payoffs of the two tactics are equal [@problem_id:2727294].
2.  **Genetic Polymorphism**: In this model, different tactics are determined by different alleles at one or more genetic loci. For these distinct genetic morphs to coexist stably in a population, they must have equal average fitness at an [equilibrium frequency](@entry_id:275072). This is typically maintained by [negative frequency-dependent selection](@entry_id:176214), where the fitness of a tactic decreases as it becomes more common. Empirical hallmarks of this model include Mendelian [inheritance patterns](@entry_id:137802) of tactics and the lack of tactic-switching when individuals are raised in different environments [@problem_id:2727294].

### Post-Copulatory Mechanisms and Paternity Assurance

Competition does not necessarily end once copulation is achieved. If females mate with multiple males, intrasexual selection can continue after mating in the form of **[sperm competition](@entry_id:269032)**. This has led to the evolution of a suite of male adaptations aimed at ensuring paternity.

#### Mate Guarding: Bridging Pre- and Post-Copulatory Competition

**Mate guarding** is a behavioral strategy where a male remains in close proximity to a female, reducing the likelihood of her mating with rivals. This tactic can be deployed at different times, targeting different stages of competition.
*   **Premating guarding** occurs before a male has copulated with a female. Its function is to prevent other males from gaining mating access, thereby tackling pre-copulatory competition. This strategy is favored when female receptivity is predictable and competition for access is intense (e.g., due to a male-biased OSR).
*   **Postcopulatory guarding** occurs after the male has inseminated the female. Its function is to prevent her from re-mating, thereby reducing or eliminating subsequent [sperm competition](@entry_id:269032). This tactic is favored when the risk of female re-mating is high and there is a significant advantage to being the last male to mate (last-male sperm precedence) [@problem_id:2727314]. Both forms of guarding represent an investment that carries an [opportunity cost](@entry_id:146217), as the guarding male forgoes the chance to search for other mates.

#### Sperm Competition: The Post-Copulatory Arena

When ejaculates from two or more males co-occur in the female reproductive tract, they compete for fertilization of the ova. This is [sperm competition](@entry_id:269032), a powerful selective force that has shaped male reproductive anatomy, physiology, and behavior. The "rules" of this competition can be conceptualized using several models:
*   **Fair Raffle**: This is the simplest model, where sperm from all males mix completely and each sperm has an equal chance of fertilizing an egg. A male's paternity share ($P_2$ for the second male) is simply proportional to the number of sperm he contributes to the mix: $P_2 = \frac{N_2}{N_1 + N_2}$.
*   **Loaded Raffle**: This model also assumes complete mixing but allows for variation in sperm "quality" or competitive ability (e.g., motility, longevity). A male's paternity share is proportional to his competitively weighted sperm number: $P_2 = \frac{w_2 N_2}{w_1 N_1 + w_2 N_2}$, where $w_i$ is the quality multiplier for male $i$.
*   **Displacement/Removal**: In some species, males have mechanisms to physically remove the sperm of previous mates. This creates a strong last-male precedence. If a second male removes a fraction $d$ of the first male's sperm, his paternity share (assuming a fair raffle among the remaining sperm) becomes $P_2 = \frac{N_2}{(1-d)N_1 + N_2}$ [@problem_id:2727275].

For a hypothetical scenario where Male 1 contributes $N_1=1.8 \times 10^5$ sperm ($w_1=0.9$) and Male 2 contributes $N_2=1.2 \times 10^5$ sperm ($w_2=1.1$), with a displacement factor of $d=0.5$, the expected second-male paternity ($P_2$) would be $0.40$ under a fair raffle, $0.45$ under a loaded raffle, and $0.57$ under displacement. These models provide a quantitative framework for understanding the diverse outcomes of post-copulatory competition.

### Intrasexual Competition and Sexual Conflict

The relentless nature of intrasexual competition can lead to outcomes that are not only costly for the competing males but also for the females with whom they mate. This generates **[sexual conflict](@entry_id:152298)**, where the evolutionary interests of males and females diverge. A primary arena for this conflict is mating rate. Male fitness often increases with every additional mating, whereas female fitness typically peaks at an intermediate mating rate due to costs associated with mating (e.g., physical harm, resource depletion).

Intense intrasexual competition can select for male traits that enhance their [fertilization](@entry_id:142259) success at the expense of female fitness. This is known as **[sexually antagonistic coevolution](@entry_id:184357)**. Consider a male trait $h$ that increases a male's paternity share in competitive situations but also inflicts harm on the female, reducing her overall [fecundity](@entry_id:181291). A mathematical model of this scenario reveals that selection can favor an increase in the harmful trait $h$ whenever the relative paternity benefit to the male outweighs his share of the [fecundity](@entry_id:181291) cost he imposes. If a female mates with $\bar{m}$ males, selection favors increased harm when $s(\bar{m}-1) > d\bar{m}$, where $s$ measures the competitive benefit of the trait and $d$ measures the harm. This condition becomes easier to satisfy as the number of competing males, $\bar{m}$, increases. Thus, stronger intrasexual competition can drive the evolution of greater male harm [@problem_id:2727310].

A striking consequence of this process is that as the harmful male trait spreads through the population, the mean [fecundity](@entry_id:181291) of females declines. This, in turn, reduces the [absolute fitness](@entry_id:168875) of all males in the population. This dynamic, where individual selection for relative advantage leads to a decline in the mean fitness of the group, represents an evolutionary "[tragedy of the commons](@entry_id:192026)." It powerfully illustrates how intrasexual selection, in driving competition among males, can shape the evolution of traits with profound and often detrimental effects on females and the population as a whole.
