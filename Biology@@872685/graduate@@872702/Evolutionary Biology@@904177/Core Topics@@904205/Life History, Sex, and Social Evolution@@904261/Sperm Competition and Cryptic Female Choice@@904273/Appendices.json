Consider a female who first mates with Male $1$ and stores $N_{1}$ sperm. Later, she mates with Male $2$, who contributes $N_{2}$ sperm. Upon the second mating, a displacement mechanism flushes a fraction $\\delta$ of the stored sperm before any mixing, where $0 \\le \\delta \\le 1$. Assume that displacement removes only stored sperm (i.e., Male $1$’s sperm) and does not remove any of the incoming Male $2$ sperm. After the second mating, the remaining Male $1$ sperm and the newly added Male $2$ sperm constitute the pool available for fertilization.\n\nAdopt the fair raffle principle of sperm competition: conditional on being present in the fertilization pool, each sperm has an equal probability of fertilizing an egg, so each male’s expected fertilization success equals his fraction of sperm in the post-displacement pool. Assume no other sources of bias, no temporal precedence aside from the displacement event, complete mixing prior to fertilization, and equal viability of all sperm.\n\nLet $P_{2}$ denote the probability that a randomly chosen egg is fertilized by Male $2$.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in mathematical biology. We will now proceed with the derivation.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nLet $N_{1,i}$ be the initial number of sperm from Male $1$ stored by the female. From the problem statement, we have:\n$$N_{1,i} = N_{1}$$\nThe female then mates with Male $2$. Before the new sperm are mixed, a displacement event occurs. A fraction $\\delta$ of the stored sperm from Male $1$ is removed. The number of sperm from Male $1$ that are removed, $N_{1,rem}$, is:\n$$N_{1,rem} = \\delta N_{1}$$\nThe number of sperm from Male $1$ remaining in storage after displacement, $N_{1,f}$, is therefore:\n$$N_{1,f} = N_{1,i} - N_{1,rem} = N_{1} - \\delta N_{1} = (1 - \\delta)N_{1}$$\nFollowing this displacement, Male $2$ contributes $N_{2}$ sperm. The problem states that displacement does not affect these incoming sperm. Thus, the final number of sperm from Male $2$ in the fertilization pool, $N_{2,f}$, is:\n$$N_{2,f} = N_{2}$$\nThe total number of sperm in the fertilization pool, $N_{total}$, is the sum of the remaining sperm from Male $1$ and the sperm from Male $2$:\n$$N_{total} = N_{1,f} + N_{2,f} = (1 - \\delta)N_{1} + N_{2}$$\nThe problem states the \"fair raffle principle,\" where a male's fertilization success is equal to his proportional representation in the fertilization sperm pool. The probability $P_{2}$ that an egg is fertilized by Male $2$ is the ratio of Male $2$'s sperm to the total sperm in the pool:\n$$P_{2} = \\frac{N_{2,f}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{N_{2}}{(1 - \\delta)N_{1} + N_{2}}$$\nThe final step is to express this probability in terms of the relative sperm number, $r = N_{2}/N_{1}$. To achieve this, we divide both the numerator and the denominator of the expression for $P_{2}$ by $N_{1}$. This is a valid operation because the problem specifies $N_{1}  0$.\n$$P_{2} = \\frac{\\frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}}}{\\frac{(1 - \\delta)N_{1} + N_{2}}{N_{1}}}$$\nSeparating the terms in the denominator gives:\n$$P_{2} = \\frac{\\frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}}}{\\frac{(1 - \\delta)N_{1}}{N_{1}} + \\frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}}}$$\nSubstituting the definition $r = N_{2}/N_{1}$, we obtain the final expression for $P_{2}$ as a function of $r$ and $\\delta$:\n$$P_{2} = \\frac{r}{1 - \\delta + r}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{r}{1 - \\delta + r}}$$", "id": "2753268"}, {"introduction": "The simple raffle model provides a static snapshot, but competition within the female reproductive tract is a dynamic process influenced by cryptic female choice.

Let male $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$ contribute $s_i$ sperm at time $t=0$.

Assume the following baseline principles:\n- Viable sperm from male $i$ constitute a well-mixed pool within the female tract.\n- The number of viable sperm from male $i$ at time $t$, denoted $N_i(t)$, follows exponential mortality appropriate for constant hazard, that is governed by the first-order differential equation $\\frac{dN_i}{dt}=-m_i N_i$ with initial condition $N_i(0)=v_i s_i$.\n- At time $t$, a fertilization event is equally likely to be caused by any currently viable sperm, so the instantaneous probability that the fertilizing sperm originates from male $i$ equals its fraction in the viable pool at that time.\n\nLet $P_2(t)$ denote the probability that a fertilization occurring at time $t$ is achieved by sperm from male $2$.

No numerical evaluation is required.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard mathematical model of a biological process, free of contradictions or ambiguities. I will therefore proceed with its solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the probability $P_2(t)$ that a fertilization event at time $t$ is achieved by sperm from male $2$. The logic proceeds as follows. First, we determine the number of viable sperm from each male, $N_1(t)$ and $N_2(t)$, as a function of time. Second, we use the principle that fertilization probability is proportional to the relative abundance of sperm in the well-mixed pool.\n\nThe dynamics of the viable sperm count for male $i$, where $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, is given by the first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_i}{dt} = -m_i N_i(t)\n$$\nThis equation describes exponential decay. The general solution is found by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{dN_i}{N_i} = \\int -m_i dt\n$$\nIntegrating yields:\n$$\n\\ln(N_i(t)) = -m_i t + C_i\n$$\nwhere $C_i$ is the constant of integration. Exponentiating both sides gives the general solution:\n$$\nN_i(t) = \\exp(-m_i t + C_i) = A_i \\exp(-m_i t)\n$$\nwhere $A_i = \\exp(C_i)$.\n\nWe determine the constant $A_i$ using the specified initial condition at time $t=0$. The initial number of sperm ejaculated by male $i$ is $s_i$, and the immediate viability factor is $v_i$. Therefore, the initial number of viable sperm is:\n$$\nN_i(0) = v_i s_i\n$$\nSubstituting this into our general solution at $t=0$:\n$$\nN_i(0) = A_i \\exp(-m_i \\cdot 0) = A_i \\exp(0) = A_i\n$$\nThus, we find $A_i = v_i s_i$. The specific solution for the number of viable sperm from male $i$ at time $t$ is:\n$$\nN_i(t) = v_i s_i \\exp(-m_i t)\n$$\nApplying this to both males, we have:\n$$\nN_1(t) = v_1 s_1 \\exp(-m_1 t)\n$$\n$$\nN_2(t) = v_2 s_2 \\exp(-m_2 t)\n$$\nThe problem states that the instantaneous probability of fertilization by a given male's sperm is equal to its fraction in the total viable pool. The total number of viable sperm at time $t$ is the sum $N_1(t) + N_2(t)$. The probability of fertilization by male $2$, denoted $P_2(t)$, is therefore the ratio of male $2$'s viable sperm to the total viable sperm:\n$$\nP_2(t) = \\frac{N_2(t)}{N_1(t) + N_2(t)}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $N_1(t)$ and $N_2(t)$:\n$$\nP_2(t) = \\frac{v_2 s_2 \\exp(-m_2 t)}{v_1 s_1 \\exp(-m_1 t) + v_2 s_2 \\exp(-m_2 t)}\n$$\nThis expression is a correct closed-form solution. However, it is conventional and more illuminating to simplify it to highlight the competitive dynamics. We can divide the numerator and the denominator by the term $v_2 s_2 \\exp(-m_2 t)$:\n$$\nP_2(t) = \\frac{\\frac{v_2 s_2 \\exp(-m_2 t)}{v_2 s_2 \\exp(-m_2 t)}}{\\frac{v_1 s_1 \\exp(-m_1 t)}{v_2 s_2 \\exp(-m_2 t)} + \\frac{v_2 s_2 \\exp(-m_2 t)}{v_2 s_2 \\exp(-m_2 t)}}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nP_2(t) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{v_1 s_1}{v_2 s_2} \\frac{\\exp(-m_1 t)}{\\exp(-m_2 t)} + 1}\n$$\nUsing the property of exponents $\\frac{\\exp(a)}{\\exp(b)} = \\exp(a-b)$, the expression becomes:\n$$\nP_2(t) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v_1 s_1}{v_2 s_2} \\exp(-m_1 t + m_2 t)}\n$$\nWhich gives the final, compact expression for $P_2(t)$:\n$$\nP_2(t) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v_1 s_1}{v_2 s_2} \\exp((m_2 - m_1)t)}\n$$\nThis form clearly shows the dependence of male $2$'s paternity share on the initial ratio of viable sperm, $\\frac{v_1 s_1}{v_2 s_2}$, and its evolution over time, governed by the difference in mortality hazards, $m_2 - m_1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v_1 s_1}{v_2 s_2} \\exp\\left((m_2 - m_1)t\\right)}}$$", "id": "2753183"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the rules of paternity competition allows us to ask evolutionary questions about male strategy.
