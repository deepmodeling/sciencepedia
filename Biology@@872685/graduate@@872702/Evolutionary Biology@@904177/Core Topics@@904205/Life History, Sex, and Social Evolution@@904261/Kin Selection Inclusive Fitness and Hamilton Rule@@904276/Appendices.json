Do not round. No units are required.", "solution": "We work from the definition of identity by descent (IBD) and Mendelian segregation. Let $g_X$ and $g_Y$ denote alleles sampled uniformly at random from the diploid genotypes of individuals $X$ and $Y$, respectively. The coefficient of relatedness $r_{XY}$ equals the expected fraction of genes identical by descent between $X$ and $Y$. In a diploid, non-inbred setting, it is convenient to compute the coefficient of coancestry $f_{XY} = \\Pr(g_X \\text{ and } g_Y \\text{ are IBD})$ via explicit IBD paths and then use $r_{XY} = 2 f_{XY}$, because each individual carries $2$ genes per autosomal locus and, in the absence of inbreeding, $f_{XY}$ is the probability that one gene from $X$ and one from $Y$ are IBD.\n\nFoundational premises we use:\n- At each meiosis, a given ancestral allele is transmitted with probability $1/2$.\n- If there are multiple independent IBD paths via distinct, non-inbred common ancestors, their contributions add, because the events are mutually exclusive with respect to the identity of the specific ancestral allele from which both sampled genes descend.\n\nCase 1: Half-siblings.\nLet the half-siblings be $S_1$ and $S_2$ who share exactly one parent $P$. Let $U$ be the unrelated other parent of $S_1$ and $V$ be the unrelated other parent of $S_2$. Consider alleles $g_{S_1}$ and $g_{S_2}$ sampled uniformly at random from $S_1$ and $S_2$, respectively. The only possible IBD path is through the shared parent $P$, since $U$ and $V$ are unrelated to each other and to $P$.\n\nFor $g_{S_1}$ and $g_{S_2}$ to be IBD via $P$, three independent conditions must hold:\n- The sampled allele $g_{S_1}$ must be the allele in $S_1$ inherited from $P$, which occurs with probability $1/2$.\n- The sampled allele $g_{S_2}$ must be the allele in $S_2$ inherited from $P$, which occurs with probability $1/2$.\n- Conditional on both sampled alleles being inherited from $P$, they must trace back to the same allelic copy in $P$. Because $P$ is diploid and non-inbred, the two allelic copies at the locus in $P$ are distinct and each child inherits one or the other with probability $1/2$. Therefore, the probability that both transmissions chose the same allelic copy is $1/2$.\n\nMultiplying these independent probabilities gives the coancestry:\n$$\nf_{\\text{HS}} \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{8}.\n$$\nThus, the coefficient of relatedness is\n$$\nr_{\\text{HS}} \\;=\\; 2 f_{\\text{HS}} \\;=\\; 2 \\times \\frac{1}{8} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\n\nCase 2: Aunt and niece (aunt is a full sibling of the niece’s parent).\nLet the aunt be $A$, the parent of the niece be $P$, and the niece be $N$. Let the two non-inbred, unrelated grandparents common to $A$ and $P$ be $G_1$ and $G_2$. Again sample alleles $g_A$ from $A$ and $g_N$ from $N$ uniformly at random.\n\nHere, there are potentially two independent IBD paths, one through $G_1$ and one through $G_2$, reflecting the full-sibling relationship between $A$ and $P$. We compute the contribution from one grandparent $G$ and then sum over $G_1$ and $G_2$.\n\nFix a grandparent $G$. For $g_A$ and $g_N$ to be IBD via $G$, the following must occur:\n- The sampled allele $g_A$ must descend from $G$. Because $A$ is the child of $G$ (through one meiosis from $G$ to $A$), and we sample one of $A$’s two alleles at random, the probability that $g_A$ is the allele inherited from $G$ is $1/2$.\n- The sampled allele $g_N$ must descend from $G$. This requires two transmissions: from $G$ to $P$ and from $P$ to $N$, each with probability $1/2$, and finally that the sampled allele in $N$ is the one inherited from $P$, again with probability $1/2$. Equivalently, we can account for sampling at the end by noting that the probability a randomly sampled allele in $N$ traces to $G$ through $P$ is $(1/2)\\times(1/2) = 1/4$ (one $1/2$ for the transmission from $G$ to $P$ and one $1/2$ for the sampling of the allele from $N$ that came from $P$).\n- Conditional on both sampled alleles being derived from $G$, they must be copies of the same allelic variant in $G$. Because $G$ is diploid and non-inbred, the probability that both transmissions ultimately pick the same allelic copy is $1/2$.\n\nMultiplying these independent probabilities for a single grandparent $G$ gives\n$$\n\\Pr(\\text{IBD via } G) \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{16}.\n$$\nBecause $G_1$ and $G_2$ are unrelated and non-inbred founders, the two IBD pathways are independent alternative origins for IBD and thus their contributions add:\n$$\nf_{\\text{AN}} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{8}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nr_{\\text{AN}} \\;=\\; 2 f_{\\text{AN}} \\;=\\; 2 \\times \\frac{1}{8} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\n\nComparison and path-based explanation:\n- Half-siblings share a single common ancestor (the shared parent) and a single IBD path contributing $\\frac{1}{8}$ to the coancestry, yielding $r_{\\text{HS}} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- An aunt and niece (with a full-sibling parent) share two common ancestors (the two grandparents). Each grandparent provides an IBD path of smaller weight $\\frac{1}{16}$ to the coancestry, but the two paths sum to the same total $\\frac{1}{8}$, again yielding $r_{\\text{AN}} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- The equality arises because the aunt–niece connection has twice as many independent IBD sources (two grandparents) as the half-sibling case (one parent), but each source is attenuated by an extra meiosis, halving the per-path contribution.\n\nHence,\n$$\nr_{\\text{HS}} - r_{\\text{AN}} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} \\;=\\; 0.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2728008"}, {"introduction": "With a firm grasp of relatedness, we can now apply the full power of inclusive fitness theory to predict the fate of a social trait. This problem provides a concrete scenario of an altruistic act with distinct costs and benefits, requiring you to calculate the net inclusive fitness effect [@problem_id:2728004]. This practice will solidify your ability to use Hamilton's rule not just as an inequality, but as a precise accounting tool for the evolutionary success of social behaviors.", "problem": "In a large, randomly mating, diploid population at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, consider a rare allele that causes its carrier (the actor) to perform a single altruistic act affecting expected reproductive outputs in one breeding season. The causal effects of this act are additive and measured as expected numbers of viable offspring produced. Specifically, the act reduces the actor’s own expected production by $c = 0.5$.

Provide the exact value; no rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard exercise in the application of inclusive fitness theory, as developed by W.D. Hamilton. We may proceed to the formal solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation and evaluation of the net inclusive-fitness effect of an altruistic act. The foundational principle, as stated in the problem, is that selection on a rare allele is governed by the total marginal change in the number of descendant allele copies resulting from the behavior. This change is aggregated over all individuals whose reproductive success is affected, with each effect weighted by the appropriate coefficient of genetic similarity (relatedness) to the actor.\n\nLet $\\Delta W_{IF}$ represent the net inclusive-fitness effect. This quantity is the sum of the direct fitness effect on the actor and the indirect fitness effects on all recipients. The direct effect is the change in the actor's own reproductive output. The indirect effects are the changes in the recipients' reproductive outputs, each weighted by the coefficient of relatedness, $r$, between the actor and the recipient. The relatedness coefficient quantifies the probability that a gene in the recipient is identical by descent to a gene in the actor. The actor's relatedness to itself is $1$.\n\nThe general expression for the net inclusive-fitness effect is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta W_{IF} = (\\text{effect on actor's fitness}) \\times r_{\\text{actor,actor}} + \\sum_{i} (\\text{effect on recipient } i\\text{'s fitness}) \\times r_{\\text{actor,recipient } i} $$\n\nFrom the problem statement, we define the following variables:\n- The cost to the actor, which is a reduction in its expected number of offspring, is denoted by $c$. The effect on the actor's fitness is thus $-c$.\n- The benefits to the recipients are increases in their expected number of offspring.\n- The coefficient of relatedness between the actor and itself is $r_{\\text{actor,actor}} = 1$.\n\nSo, the formula becomes:\n$$ \\Delta W_{IF} = -c \\cdot 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i r_i $$\nwhere $n$ is the number of recipients, $b_i$ is the benefit to recipient $i$, and $r_i$ is the coefficient of relatedness between the actor and recipient $i$. This is the formal expression for the inclusive fitness effect, and the condition for the evolution of altruism is $\\Delta W_{IF} > 0$.\n\nWe extract the following values from the problem statement:\n- The cost to the actor: $c = 0.5$.\n- The number of recipients is $2$, both of whom are the actor's full siblings.\n- The benefit to the first sibling: $b_1 = 0.2$.\n- The benefit to the second sibling: $b_2 = 0.4$.\n- The coefficient of relatedness between the actor and each full sibling: $r = 0.5$. Thus, $r_1 = r_2 = 0.5$.\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived expression for $\\Delta W_{IF}$:\n$$ \\Delta W_{IF} = -c + (b_1 r_1 + b_2 r_2) $$\n$$ \\Delta W_{IF} = -0.5 + (0.2 \\cdot 0.5 + 0.4 \\cdot 0.5) $$\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows. We can factor out the common relatedness coefficient $r = 0.5$:\n$$ \\Delta W_{IF} = -0.5 + 0.5 \\cdot (0.2 + 0.4) $$\nFirst, we sum the benefits to the recipients:\n$$ 0.2 + 0.4 = 0.6 $$\nNext, we multiply the total benefit by the coefficient of relatedness:\n$$ 0.5 \\cdot 0.6 = 0.3 $$\nThis value, $0.3$, represents the total indirect fitness gain.\n\nFinally, we calculate the net inclusive-fitness effect by subtracting the direct fitness cost from the indirect fitness gain:\n$$ \\Delta W_{IF} = -0.5 + 0.3 $$\n$$ \\Delta W_{IF} = -0.2 $$\n\nThe net inclusive-fitness effect of the act is $-0.2$. This value is dimensionless, expressed in \"offspring-equivalents,\" as requested. The negative sign indicates that the fitness cost to the actor ($c=0.5$) outweighs the total relatedness-weighted benefits to its kin ($r \\sum b_i = 0.3$).

To improve precision, control for the number of calls produced and the fraction of time the actor spent vigilant during the treatment period.\n\nWhich option most appropriately yields unbiased estimates of $b$ and $c$ and explains how to avoid collider bias in this context?", "solution": "The problem statement poses a question of experimental design and causal inference in the context of evolutionary biology, specifically the estimation of costs ($c$) and benefits ($b$) of a cooperative behavior. The statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It correctly frames the challenge as estimating the causal effect of a non-randomized variable, the amount of helping ($H$), on fitness outcomes ($W_A$ and $W_R$), in the presence of confounding variables ($E$ and unobserved factors) and the potential for collider bias. The problem is valid and can be solved using principles of modern statistics and causal inference.\n\nThe objective is to obtain unbiased estimates of the causal parameters $b$ and $c$, where $b$ is the effect of one unit of helping $H$ on the recipient's fitness $W_R$, and $c$ is the fitness cost to the actor from one unit of helping $H$. The cost $c$ is defined as the negative of the causal effect of $H$ on the actor's fitness $W_A$.\n\nA simple regression of $W_A$ or $W_R$ on $H$ is insufficient. Such an analysis would be biased by confounding variables. For instance, an actor's intrinsic quality or condition (an unobserved confounder, let us call it $U$) could influence both its propensity to help ($H$) and its own fitness ($W_A$) independent of the helping behavior itself. This creates a non-causal correlation between $H$ and $W_A$. The provided experimental manipulation is the randomization of partner presence, $T \\in \\{0,1\\}$. This randomization is the key to a valid causal estimate, as it creates a variable ($T$) that influences helping ($H$) but is, by design, uncorrelated with any pre-treatment confounders, be they observed ($E$) or unobserved ($U$).\n\nThis setup is a canonical application for an instrumental variable (IV) approach. The randomized partner presence, $T$, serves as an instrument for the endogenous treatment, $H$. For $T$ to be a valid instrument, it must satisfy three core assumptions:\n1.  **Relevance**: $T$ must have a causal effect on $H$. The presence of a partner must, on average, change the level of helping.\n2.  **Independence (Ignorability)**: $T$ must be independent of any unobserved factors $U$ that confound the relationship between $H$ and the outcomes ($W_A, W_R$). Randomization of $T$ ensures this condition holds.\n3.  **Exclusion Restriction**: $T$ must not affect the outcomes ($W_A, W_R$) through any pathway other than its effect on $H$. The mere presence of the partner, independent of the helping it elicits, should not have a direct causal effect on fitness.\n\nA further critical consideration is the avoidance of collider bias. This bias arises from controlling for a variable that is a common effect of two other variables. In this context, any post-treatment variable, such as the duration of vigilance, foraging success during the trial, or even whether cooperation occurred, is a potential collider or a mediator. Conditioning on such variables in a statistical model, or by subsetting the data, can induce spurious correlations and severely bias the estimates of causal effects. To avoid this, analysis must be performed on all subjects as randomized (the intention-to-treat principle), and models must not include post-treatment variables as controls.\n\nWith these principles established, we evaluate each option.\n\n**Option A**\nThis option presents a comprehensive and rigorous design.\n-   **Experimental Design**: It proposes to stratify by pre-treatment covariates $E$ and then randomize the treatment assignment $T$ within strata. This is excellent practice. Stratification ensures balance on key observed variables and increases statistical power. Randomizing partner identity is a further refinement that strengthens the exclusion restriction by averaging out any idiosyncratic partner effects.\n-   **Analysis**: It correctly identifies the instrumental variable strategy using two-stage least squares (2SLS) as the appropriate analytical method. The first stage, $H = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1 T + \\gamma^{\\top} E + \\varepsilon$, uses the randomized instrument $T$ to generate a prediction of helping, $\\hat{H}$, that is purged of any correlation with unobserved confounders. The second stage, $W_A = \\alpha_A' + \\theta_A H + \\beta_A'^{\\top} E + \\eta_A$ (and similarly for $W_R$), then uses this cleaned version of $H$ (in practice, $\\hat{H}$ is substituted for $H$) to estimate the causal effect. The interpretation of the resulting coefficients, $\\theta_R$ as $b$ and $-\\theta_A$ as $c$, is correct.\n-   **Collider Bias**: The option explicitly and correctly warns against conditioning on post-treatment variables and mandates analyzing all assigned units (intention-to-treat). This demonstrates a correct understanding of how to prevent collider and selection biases.\n-   **Justification**: The reasoning provided for the validity of the instrument (independence via randomization, relevance via manipulation check, exclusion via experimental design) is precise and correct. The inclusion of pre-treatment controls $E$ is correctly justified as a means to improve precision.\n\nThis option describes a state-of-the-art procedure for causal inference in this setting. It is scientifically sound.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option B**\nThis option describes an observational study, not a randomized experiment.\n-   **Experimental Design**: \"Allow partners to self-assemble naturally\" means there is no randomization of $T$. Any association found is subject to self-selection bias. Matching on observed covariates $E$ can reduce some confounding but is incapable of addressing confounding from unobserved variables (e.g., an actor's intrinsic cooperativeness or condition).\n-   **Analysis**: The proposed regression model, $W_A = \\alpha_A + \\delta_A T + \\phi_A H + \\beta_A^{\\top} E + \\eta_A$, is misspecified for causal inference. It attempts to estimate the effect of $H$ while \"controlling for\" $T$, but $T$ and $H$ are not independent influences; $T$ is a cause of $H$. Because $H$ is endogenous (correlated with the error term via unobserved confounders), the estimate of $\\phi_A$ will be biased. Furthermore, \"restrict the analysis to cases with confirmed encounters\" and \"control for realized foraging success\" constitute conditioning on post-treatment variables, which introduces collider bias.\n\nThis approach is fundamentally flawed for estimating causal effects.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option C**\nThis option begins with randomization but then employs a flawed analytical strategy.\n-   **Analysis**: It suggests controlling for post-treatment variables such as \"vigilance duration, encounter success with the partner, and realized foraging success\". This is a textbook example of what not to do. These variables are mediators or colliders. Controlling for them will either block the very causal pathway of interest or induce spurious correlations, leading to biased estimates.\n-   **Data Selection**: \"Exclude trials where the partner failed to elicit any helping\" violates the intention-to-treat principle. This is a form of conditioning on a post-treatment outcome ($H > 0$), which introduces selection bias.\n-   **Covariate Selection**: Selecting covariates $E$ based on a p-value threshold (e.g., five percent level) is poor statistical practice that leads to biased estimates and invalid standard errors. Pre-treatment covariates should be selected based on theoretical considerations before analyzing the data.\n\nThe analysis plan proposed in this option would invalidate the benefits of the initial randomization.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option D**\nThis option proposes a weak quasi-experimental design.\n-   **Experimental Design**: A \"before-after design without randomization\" is highly susceptible to confounding by any other factors that change over time. Without a contemporaneous control group, one cannot distinguish the effect of the treatment from secular trends (e.g., seasonal changes in food availability or predator density).\n-   **Analysis**: The regression of $\\Delta W_A$ on $\\Delta H$ does not solve the problem of unobserved confounding. Any unobserved factor that changes over time and affects both the change in helping and the change in fitness will bias the estimate. Additionally, controlling for \"number of calls produced and the fraction of time the actor spent vigilant\" during the treatment period is another instance of improperly conditioning on post-treatment variables that are part of or consequences of the behavior $H$.\n\nThis design and analysis are inadequate for establishing causality.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, only Option A outlines a methodologically sound approach that correctly combines a strong experimental design (randomization) with an appropriate statistical model (instrumental variables) and correctly identifies and avoids critical pitfalls like collider bias and selection bias.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2727995"}]}
