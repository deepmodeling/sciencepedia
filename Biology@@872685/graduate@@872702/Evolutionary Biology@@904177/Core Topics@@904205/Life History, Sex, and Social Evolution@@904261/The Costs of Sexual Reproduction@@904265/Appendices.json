Assume there is no differential mortality between the sexes before reproduction and that mating does not limit female realization of fecundity as long as males are present.\n\nPopulation $s$ is obligately sexual: only females reproduce. Population $a$ is obligately asexual (clonal): every individual reproduces and produces only female offspring genetically identical to the parent. For both populations, define the per-generation growth factor $\\lambda$ as the multiplicative factor by which the number of reproductive individuals changes from generation $t$ to $t+1$.\n\nUsing only fundamental demographic definitions of fecundity and class contribution to the next generation, and without invoking any pre-derived results specific to the costs of sex, derive closed-form expressions for:\n- $\\lambda_s$, the per-generation growth factor in the number of reproductive individuals for the sexual population,\n- $\\lambda_a$, the per-generation growth factor in the number of reproductive individuals for the asexual population,\n- the cost ratio $\\lambda_a/\\lambda_s$ as a function of $\\alpha$ and $F$.\n\nProvide exact expressions.

She produces an expected total of $R$ viable zygotes. We are asked to find the expected number of copies of allele $A$ among these $R$ zygotes for three different modes of reproduction. Let $E[N_A]$ denote this expectation. The expectation can be calculated as the product of the total number of zygotes, $R$, and the expected number of $A$ alleles per zygote under each mode.\n\n$1$. **Pure Outcrossing**\n\nIn this mode, all $R$ zygotes are produced by outcrossing. The maternal individual has genotype $Aa$. According to Mendel's law of segregation, she produces two types of gametes (ova) in equal proportions: $50\\%$ with allele $A$ and $50\\%$ with allele $a$. The probability that a randomly chosen ovum from this female carries allele $A$ is therefore $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe problem states that the focal allele $A$ is rare, such that we can neglect its presence in the outcross pollen pool. This means we assume all fertilizing male gametes carry the resident allele $a$.\n\nTherefore, two types of zygotes can be formed:\n- An ovum with allele $A$ is fertilized by a pollen grain with allele $a$, resulting in a zygote of genotype $Aa$. This occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.

The total expected number of $A$ alleles is the sum of the contributions from these two subsets of zygotes.\n\n- **Contribution from outcrossing:**\nThe number of outcrossed zygotes is $(1-s)R$. From the analysis above, the expected number of $A$ alleles per outcrossed zygote is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the expected number of $A$ alleles from this fraction of the offspring is:\n$$E[N_A]_{\\text{outcrossed part}} = (1-s)R \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{R(1-s)}{2}$$\n\n- **Contribution from selfing:**\nThe number of self-fertilized zygotes is $sR$. For self-fertilization, both the ovum and the pollen grain come from the same $Aa$ individual. The gametes produced are $50\\%$ $A$ and $50\\%$ $a$ for both ova and pollen.

There is no meiosis or syngamy. The maternal genotype is $Aa$.\nTherefore, every one of the $R$ zygotes produced will also have the genotype $Aa$. Each $Aa$ zygote contains exactly $1$ copy of the allele $A$.\nThe total expected number of copies of allele $A$ among the $R$ clonal zygotes is:\n$$E[N_A]_{\\text{clonal}} = R \\times 1 = R$$\n\nIn summary, the expected number of copies of allele $A$ passed to the next generation by a heterozygous $Aa$ female producing $R$ zygotes are:\n- Pure outcrossing: $\\frac{R}{2}$\n- Partial selfing with rate $s$: $\\frac{R(1+s)}{2}$\n- Clonal reproduction: $R$\n\nThe problem requires these results to be reported as a single row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{R}{2}  \\frac{R(1+s)}{2}  R\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2757251"}, {"introduction": "Sexual reproduction's shuffling of genes can be a double-edged sword.
