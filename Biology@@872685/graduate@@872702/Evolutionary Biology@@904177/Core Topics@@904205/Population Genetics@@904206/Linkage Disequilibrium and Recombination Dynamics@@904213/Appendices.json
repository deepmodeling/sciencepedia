This exercise focuses on the latter, guiding you through the fundamental process by which meiotic recombination breaks down non-random associations between alleles over time. By deriving the classic decay equation for the LD coefficient $D$, you will build a first-principles understanding of its dynamics and its direct relationship with the recombination rate, $r$ [@problem_id:2728798].", "problem": "Consider a large, randomly mating population with non-overlapping generations evolving under no selection, no mutation, and no migration. Two diallelic loci, denoted by $A/a$ and $B/b$, lie on the same chromosome with recombination fraction $r$ between them, where $0  r  \\tfrac{1}{2}$. Let the haplotype frequencies in generation $t$ be $p_{AB,t}$, $p_{Ab,t}$, $p_{aB,t}$, and $p_{ab,t}$, which sum to $1$. Let the allele frequencies be $p_{A,t} = p_{AB,t} + p_{Ab,t}$ and $p_{B,t} = p_{AB,t} + p_{aB,t}$. Define the two-locus Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) coefficient as $D_t = p_{AB,t} - p_{A,t} p_{B,t}$.\n\nStarting only from these definitions and Mendelian recombination with recombination fraction $r$, first derive the recursion for the haplotype frequency $p_{AB,t+1}$ in terms of $p_{AB,t}$, $p_{Ab,t}$, $p_{aB,t}$, $p_{ab,t}$, and $r$. Then use it to obtain a closed-form expression for $D_t$ as a function of $t$, $r$, and $D_0$.\n\nFinally, for $r = 0.02$, compute the minimal integer number of generations $t_{\\tfrac{1}{2}}$ required so that $|D_t| \\leq \\tfrac{1}{2} |D_0|$. Report $t_{\\tfrac{1}{2}}$ as an integer (no units).", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It represents a fundamental exercise in classical population genetics. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem contains three parts. First, we must derive the recursion for the haplotype frequency $p_{AB,t+1}$. Second, we must derive a closed-form expression for the linkage disequilibrium coefficient $D_t$. Third, we must compute the half-life of linkage disequilibrium for a specific recombination rate.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the recursion for $p_{AB,t+1}$\n\nWe consider a large, randomly mating population. The frequency of any haplotype in the gamete pool of generation $t+1$ is determined by the frequencies in generation $t$ and the process of meiosis, which includes recombination. A haplotype $AB$ in generation $t+1$ can be formed in one of two ways:\n\n1. It is a direct copy of a parental $AB$ haplotype that was transmitted without recombination. The frequency of $AB$ haplotypes in the generation $t$ gamete pool is $p_{AB,t}$. The probability that such a haplotype does not undergo recombination between the $A$ and $B$ loci is $(1-r)$. Therefore, the contribution from non-recombinant gametes to the frequency of $AB$ in the next generation is $(1-r)p_{AB,t}$.\n\n2. It is newly formed by a recombination event. In a randomly mating population, the two homologous chromosomes that undergo meiosis in an individual are drawn independently from the gamete pool of the previous generation. A new $AB$ haplotype is formed if one parental chromosome carries allele $A$ and the other carries allele $B$, and a crossover occurs between them. The probability of drawing a chromosome with allele $A$ is $p_{A,t}$, and the probability of drawing one with allele $B$ is $p_{B,t}$. Due to random mating, the frequency of zygotes formed from gametes containing these alleles (in any combination on the two chromosomes) provides the pool for recombination. The overall frequency with which recombination brings an $A$ allele from one chromosome and a $B$ allele from the homologous chromosome together onto a single new chromosome is given by the product of the recombination fraction $r$ and the frequencies of the respective alleles in the population, $p_{A,t}$ and $p_{B,t}$. This contributes $r p_{A,t} p_{B,t}$ to the frequency of $AB$ in the next generation.\n\nCombining these two possibilities, the total frequency of haplotype $AB$ in generation $t+1$ is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$p_{AB, t+1} = (1-r)p_{AB,t} + r p_{A,t} p_{B,t}$$\nThis is the required recursion for the haplotype frequency $p_{AB,t+1}$.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of a closed-form expression for $D_t$\n\nThe linkage disequilibrium coefficient in generation $t$ is defined as $D_t = p_{AB,t} - p_{A,t} p_{B,t}$. We seek an expression for $D_t$ in terms of $D_0$, $r$, and $t$.\n\nFirst, we establish that under the given conditions (no selection, mutation, or migration), allele frequencies are constant across generations. The frequency of allele $A$ in generation $t+1$ is $p_{A,t+1} = p_{AB,t+1} + p_{Ab,t+1}$. A similar recursion as the one derived for $p_{AB,t+1}$ holds for $p_{Ab,t+1}$:\n$$p_{Ab, t+1} = (1-r)p_{Ab,t} + r p_{A,t} p_{b,t}$$\nwhere $p_{b,t} = 1 - p_{B,t}$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $p_{A,t+1}$:\n$$p_{A,t+1} = \\left( (1-r)p_{AB,t} + r p_{A,t} p_{B,t} \\right) + \\left( (1-r)p_{Ab,t} + r p_{A,t} p_{b,t} \\right)$$\n$$p_{A,t+1} = (1-r)(p_{AB,t} + p_{Ab,t}) + r p_{A,t}(p_{B,t} + p_{b,t})$$\nUsing the definitions $p_{A,t} = p_{AB,t} + p_{Ab,t}$ and $p_{B,t} + p_{b,t} = 1$:\n$$p_{A,t+1} = (1-r)p_{A,t} + r p_{A,t}(1) = p_{A,t} - r p_{A,t} + r p_{A,t} = p_{A,t}$$\nThus, the allele frequency $p_A$ is constant over time. By identical logic, $p_B$ is also constant. We can therefore drop the time subscript for allele frequencies: $p_A \\equiv p_{A,t}$ and $p_B \\equiv p_{B,t}$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\nNow, let's write the recursion for $D_t$.\n$$D_{t+1} = p_{AB,t+1} - p_{A,t+1} p_{B,t+1} = p_{AB,t+1} - p_A p_B$$\nSubstitute the expression for $p_{AB,t+1}$:\n$$D_{t+1} = \\left( (1-r)p_{AB,t} + r p_A p_B \\right) - p_A p_B$$\n$$D_{t+1} = (1-r)p_{AB,t} - (1-r)p_A p_B$$\n$$D_{t+1} = (1-r)(p_{AB,t} - p_A p_B)$$\nBy definition, $D_t = p_{AB,t} - p_A p_B$. So, we have the simple geometric recursion:\n$$D_{t+1} = (1-r)D_t$$\nThis relationship shows that linkage disequilibrium decays by a factor of $(1-r)$ each generation. Applying this recursion $t$ times from an initial state $D_0$ yields the closed-form expression:\n$$D_t = (1-r)^t D_0$$\n\nPart 3: Calculation of the half-life of LD\n\nWe are asked to find the minimal integer number of generations $t_{\\frac{1}{2}}$ required for the magnitude of linkage disequilibrium to be reduced to at most half of its initial magnitude. This is expressed by the inequality:\n$$|D_t| \\le \\frac{1}{2} |D_0|$$\nSubstituting the expression for $D_t$:\n$$|(1-r)^t D_0| \\le \\frac{1}{2} |D_0|$$\nIf $D_0 \\neq 0$, we can divide by $|D_0|$:\n$$|(1-r)^t| \\le \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe problem states $0  r  \\frac{1}{2}$, which implies $0  1-r  1$. For any non-negative integer $t$, $(1-r)^t$ is positive, so the absolute value is redundant.\n$$(1-r)^t \\le \\frac{1}{2}$$\nTo solve for $t$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides.\n$$\\ln((1-r)^t) \\le \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\n$$t \\ln(1-r) \\le -\\ln(2)$$\nSince $0  1-r  1$, its logarithm $\\ln(1-r)$ is a negative number. Dividing the inequality by this negative number reverses the inequality sign:\n$$t \\ge \\frac{-\\ln(2)}{\\ln(1-r)} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{-\\ln(1-r)}$$\nWe are given $r = 0.02$. Substituting this value:\n$$t \\ge \\frac{\\ln(2)}{-\\ln(1-0.02)} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{-\\ln(0.98)}$$\nNumerically, $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$ and $\\ln(0.98) \\approx -0.020203$.\n$$t \\ge \\frac{0.693147}{-(-0.020203)} \\approx 34.309$$\nSince $t$ must be an integer number of generations, the minimal integer value for $t$ that satisfies this condition is the smallest integer greater than or equal to $34.309$.\n$$t_{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\lceil 34.309 \\ldots \\rceil = 35$$\nTherefore, it takes $35$ generations for the linkage disequilibrium to decay to half or less of its original value.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{35}$$", "id": "2728798"}, {"introduction": "While the covariance $D$ is the foundational measure of linkage disequilibrium, its absolute value is constrained by the allele frequencies at the loci being studied.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Bounds on D and Definition of D'**\nThe four haplotype frequencies can be expressed in terms of allele frequencies and the linkage disequilibrium parameter $D$.\nFrom the definitions $p_A = f_{AB} + f_{Ab}$ and $p_B = f_{AB} + f_{aB}$, and $D = f_{AB} - p_A p_B$, we derive:\n$f_{AB} = p_A p_B + D$\n$f_{Ab} = p_A - f_{AB} = p_A - (p_A p_B + D) = p_A(1 - p_B) - D = p_A p_b - D$\n$f_{aB} = p_B - f_{AB} = p_B - (p_A p_B + D) = p_B(1 - p_A) - D = p_a p_B - D$\nSince the frequencies must sum to $1$, the fourth frequency is:\n$f_{ab} = 1 - f_{AB} - f_{Ab} - f_{aB} = 1 - (p_A p_B + D) - (p_A p_b - D) - (p_a p_B - D) = 1 - p_A(p_B+p_b) - p_a p_B + D = 1 - p_A - p_a p_B + D = p_a - p_a p_B + D = p_a(1-p_B) + D = p_a p_b + D$.\n\nThe fundamental constraint is that all frequencies must be non-negative ($f_{ij} \\ge 0$). Applying this to each of the four expressions:\n1. $f_{AB} \\ge 0 \\implies p_A p_B + D \\ge 0 \\implies D \\ge -p_A p_B$\n2. $f_{Ab} \\ge 0 \\implies p_A p_b - D \\ge 0 \\implies D \\le p_A p_b$\n3. $f_{aB} \\ge 0 \\implies p_a p_B - D \\ge 0 \\implies D \\le p_a p_B$\n4. $f_{ab} \\ge 0 \\implies p_a p_b + D \\ge 0 \\implies D \\ge -p_a p_b$\n\nCombining these inequalities provides the tight bounds for $D$:\nThe lower bound is $D \\ge \\max(-p_A p_B, -p_a p_b) = -\\min(p_A p_B, p_a p_b)$. Let this be $D_{\\min}$.\nThe upper bound is $D \\le \\min(p_A p_b, p_a p_B)$. Let this be $D_{\\max}$.\nThus, the tight bounds are $D_{\\min} \\le D \\le D_{\\max}$.\n\nThe normalized linkage disequilibrium, $D'$, is defined by dividing $D$ by its theoretical maximum magnitude for the given allele frequencies.\nIf $D  0$, the maximum possible value is $D_{\\max}$. Thus, $D' = \\frac{D}{D_{\\max}} = \\frac{D}{\\min(p_A p_b, p_a p_B)}$.\nIf $D  0$, the minimum possible value is $D_{\\min}$, so the maximum magnitude is $|D_{\\min}| = -D_{\\min}$. Thus, $D' = \\frac{D}{|D_{\\min}|} = \\frac{D}{-D_{\\min}} = \\frac{D}{\\min(p_A p_B, p_a p_b)}$.\nIf $D = 0$, $D'$ is $0$.\n\n**Part 2: Pearson Correlation Coefficient r**\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient is $r = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y}$.\nThe means of the Bernoulli random variables $X$ and $Y$ are $E[X] = p_A$ and $E[Y] = p_B$.\nThe expectation of their product is $E[XY] = \\Pr(X=1, Y=1) = f_{AB}$.\nThe covariance is $\\text{Cov}(X,Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y] = f_{AB} - p_A p_B = D$.\nThe variances of Bernoulli variables are $\\sigma_X^2 = p_A(1-p_A) = p_A p_a$ and $\\sigma_Y^2 = p_B(1-p_B) = p_B p_b$.\nThe standard deviations are $\\sigma_X = \\sqrt{p_A p_a}$ and $\\sigma_Y = \\sqrt{p_B p_b}$.\nSubstituting these into the formula for $r$:\n$$r = \\frac{D}{\\sqrt{p_A p_a p_B p_b}}$$\nThe squared correlation coefficient, $r^2$, is a common measure of linkage disequilibrium:\n$$r^2 = \\frac{D^2}{p_A p_a p_B p_b}$$\n\n**Part 3: Mutual Information I(X;Y)**\nMutual information between two discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$ is given by:\n$$I(X;Y) = \\sum_{x,y} \\Pr(x,y) \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Pr(x,y)}{\\Pr(x)\\Pr(y)}\\right)$$\nIn this context, the joint probabilities $\\Pr(x,y)$ are the haplotype frequencies $f_{ij}$, and the marginal probabilities $\\Pr(x)$ and $\\Pr(y)$ are the allele frequencies $p_i$ and $p_j$. The summation is over all four haplotypes.\n$$I(X;Y) = f_{AB} \\ln\\left(\\frac{f_{AB}}{p_A p_B}\\right) + f_{Ab} \\ln\\left(\\frac{f_{Ab}}{p_A p_b}\\right) + f_{aB} \\ln\\left(\\frac{f_{aB}}{p_a p_B}\\right) + f_{ab} \\ln\\left(\\frac{f_{ab}}{p_a p_b}\\right)$$\nThis is measured in nats, as the natural logarithm is used.\n\n**Part 4: Numerical Computations**\nGiven haplotype frequencies: $f_{AB} = 0.32$, $f_{Ab} = 0.18$, $f_{aB} = 0.28$, $f_{ab} = 0.22$.\n1.

However, its value is constrained by the allele frequencies of the population. The range $[D_{\\min}, D_{\\max}]$ is often asymmetric and its width depends heavily on $p_A$ and $p_B$. For example, if one allele is rare, the maximum possible value of $D$ is small. This makes it impossible to compare the strength of linkage disequilibrium between populations or loci with different allele frequencies using $D$ alone.\n\nThe normalized measure $D'$ corrects for this dependency. By scaling $D$ to its maximum possible value given the allele frequencies, $D'$ always ranges from $-1$ to $1$. A value of $D'=-1$ or $D'=1$ represents complete linkage disequilibrium, where at least one of the four haplotypes is absent. This normalization renders the metric comparable across different systems. In a randomly mating population, recombination breaks down associations, driving $D$ and $D'$ toward $0$. A value of $|D'|$ near $1$ therefore signifies that recombination has been ineffective at breaking down the non-random association between alleles. This can be due to very tight physical linkage (low recombination rate), a recent event such as mutation or population admixture, or strong natural selection favoring certain haplotype combinations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.1000  0.08165  0.006667  0.003338 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2728701"}, {"introduction": "In real populations, recombination does not act in a vacuum; its effects on linkage disequilibrium are intertwined with other evolutionary forces like genetic drift and natural selection that alter allele frequencies.

We are given the following definitions:\nInitial squared correlation:\n$$r^2 = \\frac{D^2}{p_A (1 - p_A)\\, p_B (1 - p_B)}$$\nFinal squared correlation:\n$$r'^2 = \\frac{D'^2}{p_A' (1 - p_A')\\, p_B' (1 - p_B')}$$\nThe linkage disequilibrium changes according to the relation $D' = kD$, where $k$ is a factor such that $0  k  1$. This implies $|D'|  |D|$ for any non-zero $D$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $D'$ into the equation for $r'^2$, we obtain:\n$$r'^2 = \\frac{(kD)^2}{p_A' (1 - p_A')\\, p_B' (1 - p_B')} = \\frac{k^2 D^2}{p_A' (1 - p_A')\\, p_B' (1 - p_B')}$$\n\nThe condition to be investigated is $r'^2  r^2$. We can write this inequality by substituting the expressions for $r^2$ and $r'^2$:\n$$\\frac{k^2 D^2}{p_A' (1 - p_A')\\, p_B' (1 - p_B')}  \\frac{D^2}{p_A (1 - p_A)\\, p_B (1 - p_B)}$$\n\nAssuming $D \\neq 0$, we have $D^2  0$, so we can divide both sides of the inequality by $D^2$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\\frac{k^2}{p_A' (1 - p_A')\\, p_B' (1 - p_B')}  \\frac{1}{p_A (1 - p_A)\\, p_B (1 - p_B)}$$\n\nWe can now isolate $k^2$ by multiplying both sides by the denominator of the left-hand side. Since allele frequencies are between $0$ and $1$, the term $p_X'(1-p_X')$ is non-negative. We assume non-trivial cases where frequencies are not fixed at $0$ or $1$, making this term strictly positive.\n$$k^2  \\frac{p_A' (1 - p_A')\\, p_B' (1 - p_B')}{p_A (1 - p_A)\\, p_B (1 - p_B)}$$\n\nGiven that $k$ is a positive real number ($0  k  1$), we can take the square root of both sides of the inequality:\n$$k  \\sqrt{\\frac{p_A' (1 - p_A')\\, p_B' (1 - p_B')}{p_A (1 - p_A)\\, p_B (1 - p_B)}}$$\n\nThis inequality has the form $k  k_{\\star}$, where we define the threshold $k_{\\star}$ as:\n$$k_{\\star} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_A' (1 - p_A')\\, p_B' (1 - p_B')}{p_A (1 - p_A)\\, p_B (1 - p_B)}}$$\nThis expression for $k_{\\star}$ depends only on the initial allele frequencies $(p_A, p_B)$ and the final allele frequencies $(p_A', p_B')$, as required. This completes the derivation. The paradox of increasing $r^2$ while $D$ decays is possible if the denominator of $r^2$, which represents the product of allele variances, decreases more rapidly than $D^2$ does.\n\nNext, we provide the requested concrete counterexample. The given parameters are:\nInitial state: $p_A = 0.8$, $p_B = 0.2$, $D = 0.002$.\nFinal state: $p_A' = 0.95$, $p_B' = 0.05$.\nRecombination factor: $k = 0.9$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial squared correlation, $r^2$. The denominator is:\n$$p_A(1 - p_A)p_B(1 - p_B) = (0.8)(1 - 0.8)(0.2)(1 - 0.2) = (0.8)(0.2)(0.2)(0.8) = 0.0256$$\nThus,\n$$r^2 = \\frac{D^2}{0.0256} = \\frac{(0.002)^2}{0.0256} = \\frac{0.000004}{0.0256} = 0.00015625$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $r^2 = 0.0001563$.\n\nNow, we calculate the variables for the final state. The new value of linkage disequilibrium is:\n$$D' = kD = (0.9)(0.002) = 0.0018$$\nNote that $|D'| = 0.0018  0.002 = |D|$, so the magnitude of LD has indeed decreased.\n\nThe denominator for the final squared correlation, $r'^2$, is:\n$$p_A'(1 - p_A')p_B'(1 - p_B') = (0.95)(1 - 0.95)(0.05)(1 - 0.05) = (0.95)(0.05)(0.05)(0.95) = (0.0475)^2 = 0.00225625$$\nThus, the final squared correlation is:\n$$r'^2 = \\frac{D'^2}{0.00225625} = \\frac{(0.0018)^2}{0.00225625} = \\frac{0.00000324}{0.00225625} \\approx 0.001435991...$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $r'^2 = 0.001436$.\n\nComparing the two values:\n$r'^2 \\approx 0.001436$\n$r^2 \\approx 0.0001563$\nClearly, $r'^2  r^2$. This demonstrates that even with recombination reducing the absolute measure of linkage disequilibrium $D$, the normalized measure $r^2$ can increase if allele frequencies shift toward fixation, thereby drastically reducing the product of allele variances in the denominator. The condition $k  k_{\\star}$ is satisfied, as $k=0.9$ and $k_{\\star} = \\sqrt{0.00225625 / 0.0256} = \\sqrt{0.088134765625} = 0.296875$.\n\nThe analysis confirms the phenomenon and provides the exact threshold condition. The final answer is the derived analytical expression for $k_{\\star}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_A' (1 - p_A') p_B' (1 - p_B')}{p_A (1 - p_A) p_B (1 - p_B)}}}$$", "id": "2728816"}]}
