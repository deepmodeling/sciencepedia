It is a standard exercise in population genetics that tests the understanding of fundamental definitions relating allele and haplotype frequencies. The problem requires not only computation but also a consistency check, which is an integral part of a rigorous analysis. The provided data are sufficient and do not contain immediate contradictions, though their mutual consistency must be verified as part of the solution. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nWe begin the solution process. The problem provides a system of linear equations based on the definitions of allele frequencies and the fact that all haplotype frequencies must sum to unity.\n\nThe allele frequencies for alleles $A$ and $B$ are given by the marginal sums of the corresponding haplotype frequencies:\n$$p_{A} = P_{AB} + P_{Ab}$$\n$$p_{B} = P_{AB} + P_{aB}$$\n\nThe frequencies of the alternative alleles, $a$ and $b$, are derived from the fact that the sum of frequencies for alleles at a single locus must equal $1$:\n$$p_{a} = 1 - p_{A}$$\n$$p_{b} = 1 - p_{B}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values, we find:\n$$p_{a} = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4$$\n$$p_{b} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$$\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the three unknown haplotype frequencies: $P_{Ab}$, $P_{aB}$, and $P_{ab}$.\n\nFirst, we compute $P_{Ab}$ by rearranging the definition of $p_{A}$:\n$$P_{Ab} = p_{A} - P_{AB}$$\nGiven $p_{A} = 0.6$ and $P_{AB} = 0.25$, we obtain:\n$$P_{Ab} = 0.6 - 0.25 = 0.35$$\n\nSecond, we compute $P_{aB}$ by rearranging the definition of $p_{B}$:\n$$P_{aB} = p_{B} - P_{AB}$$\nGiven $p_{B} = 0.3$ and $P_{AB} = 0.25$, we obtain:\n$$P_{aB} = 0.3 - 0.25 = 0.05$$\n\nThird, we compute $P_{ab}$ using the constraint that the sum of all four haplotype frequencies must be $1$:\n$$P_{AB} + P_{Ab} + P_{aB} + P_{ab} = 1$$\n$$P_{ab} = 1 - (P_{AB} + P_{Ab} + P_{aB})$$\nSubstituting the known and calculated values:\n$$P_{ab} = 1 - (0.25 + 0.35 + 0.05) = 1 - 0.65 = 0.35$$\n\nThe resulting haplotype frequencies are $P_{AB} = 0.25$, $P_{Ab} = 0.35$, $P_{aB} = 0.05$, and $P_{ab} = 0.35$.\n\nThe problem demands verification that this constitutes a valid probability distribution. This requires two checks:\n1.  Nonnegativity: All calculated frequencies ($0.35$, $0.05$, $0.35$) are nonnegative, as is the given $P_{AB} = 0.25$. This condition is satisfied.\n2.  Sum to unity: $0.25 + 0.35 + 0.05 + 0.35 = 1.0$. This condition is also satisfied.\nThe resulting haplotype frequency vector is a valid probability distribution.\n\nFinally, we must assess whether the given $P_{AB}$ is consistent with the feasible region implied by $p_{A}$ and $p_{B}$. The four haplotype frequencies must be nonnegative. From the relations we used:\n1.  $P_{AB} \\ge 0$ (given as $0.25$)\n2.  $P_{Ab} = p_{A} - P_{AB} \\ge 0 \\implies P_{AB} \\le p_{A}$\n3.  $P_{aB} = p_{B} - P_{AB} \\ge 0 \\implies P_{AB} \\le p_{B}$\n4.  $P_{ab} = p_{a} - P_{aB} = (1 - p_{A}) - (p_{B} - P_{AB}) = 1 - p_{A} - p_{B} + P_{AB} \\ge 0 \\implies P_{AB} \\ge p_{A} + p_{B} - 1$\n\nCombining these inequalities provides the theoretical bounds for $P_{AB}$:\n$$\\max(0, p_{A} + p_{B} - 1) \\le P_{AB} \\le \\min(p_{A}, p_{B})$$\n\nWe substitute the given allele frequencies $p_{A} = 0.6$ and $p_{B} = 0.3$ into this expression:\nLower bound: $\\max(0, 0.6 + 0.3 - 1) = \\max(0, -0.1) = 0$\nUpper bound: $\\min(0.6, 0.3) = 0.3$\n\nThus, for the given allele frequencies, the haplotype frequency $P_{AB}$ must lie in the interval $[0, 0.3]$. The problem states that $P_{AB} = 0.25$. Since $0 \\le 0.25 \\le 0.3$, the given value of $P_{AB}$ is consistent with the provided allele frequencies.\n\nThe complete analysis confirms the internal consistency of the problem's premises and yields the unique values for the unknown haplotype frequencies.\n\nThe required values are $P_{Ab} = 0.35$, $P_{aB} = 0.05$, and $P_{ab} = 0.35$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.35  0.05  0.35\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2732264"}, {"introduction": "While the linkage disequilibrium coefficient, $D$, provides a raw measure of deviation from independence, its magnitude can be difficult to interpret on its own.

We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the correlation coefficient, $r$, between two genetic loci. This can be addressed by formalizing the state of each locus as a random variable. We adopt the standard additive coding scheme for biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).\n\nLet $X_{\\mathrm{A}}$ be an indicator random variable for the allele at locus A in a randomly sampled gamete from the population. We assign $X_{\\mathrm{A}} = 1$ if the allele is 'A' and $X_{\\mathrm{A}} = 0$ if the allele is 'a'.\nSimilarly, let $X_{\\mathrm{B}}$ be an indicator random variable for the allele at locus B, with $X_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1$ for allele 'B' and $X_{\\mathrm{B}} = 0$ for allele 'b'.\n\nThe probabilities of these events are given by the allele frequencies in the population:\n$P(X_{\\mathrm{A}}=1) = p_{\\mathrm{A}} = 0.3$\n$P(X_{\\mathrm{A}}=0) = p_{\\mathrm{a}} = 1 - p_{\\mathrm{A}} = 0.7$\n$P(X_{\\mathrm{B}}=1) = p_{\\mathrm{B}} = 0.7$\n$P(X_{\\mathrm{B}}=0) = p_{\\mathrm{b}} = 1 - p_{\\mathrm{B}} = 0.3$\n\nThese random variables, $X_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and $X_{\\mathrm{B}}$, follow Bernoulli distributions. The correlation coefficient $r$ between them is defined by the fundamental statistical formula:\n$$ r = \\mathrm{Corr}(X_{\\mathrm{A}}, X_{\\mathrm{B}}) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(X_{\\mathrm{A}}, X_{\\mathrm{B}})}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(X_{\\mathrm{A}}) \\mathrm{Var}(X_{\\mathrm{B}})}} $$\n\nWe must compute the three components of this expression: the covariance and the two variances.\n\nFirst, we compute the expectation of each random variable. For a Bernoulli variable with success probability $p$, the expectation is $p$.\n$E[X_{\\mathrm{A}}] = 1 \\cdot P(X_{\\mathrm{A}}=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_{\\mathrm{A}}=0) = P(X_{\\mathrm{A}}=1) = p_{\\mathrm{A}} = 0.3$\n$E[X_{\\mathrm{B}}] = 1 \\cdot P(X_{\\mathrm{B}}=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_{\\mathrm{B}}=0) = P(X_{\\mathrm{B}}=1) = p_{\\mathrm{B}} = 0.7$\n\nNext, we compute the variances. For a Bernoulli variable with success probability $p$, the variance is $p(1-p)$.\n$\\mathrm{Var}(X_{\\mathrm{A}}) = E[X_{\\mathrm{A}}^2] - (E[X_{\\mathrm{A}}])^2 = p_{\\mathrm{A}} - p_{\\mathrm{A}}^2 = p_{\\mathrm{A}}(1 - p_{\\mathrm{A}}) = p_{\\mathrm{A}}p_{\\mathrm{a}}$\n$\\mathrm{Var}(X_{\\mathrm{A}}) = 0.3 \\times (1 - 0.3) = 0.3 \\times 0.7 = 0.21$\n\n$\\mathrm{Var}(X_{\\mathrm{B}}) = p_{\\mathrm{B}}(1 - p_{\\mathrm{B}}) = p_{\\mathrm{B}}p_{\\mathrm{b}}$\n$\\mathrm{Var}(X_{\\mathrm{B}}) = 0.7 \\times (1 - 0.7) = 0.7 \\times 0.3 = 0.21$\n\nNow, we compute the covariance, defined as $\\mathrm{Cov}(X_{\\mathrm{A}}, X_{\\mathrm{B}}) = E[X_{\\mathrm{A}}X_{\\mathrm{B}}] - E[X_{\\mathrm{A}}]E[X_{\\mathrm{B}}]$.\nThe product $X_{\\mathrm{A}}X_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is $1$ only when both $X_{\\mathrm{A}}=1$ and $X_{\\mathrm{B}}=1$; otherwise it is $0$. Therefore, the expectation of the product is:\n$E[X_{\\mathrm{A}}X_{\\mathrm{B}}] = 1 \\cdot P(X_{\\mathrm{A}}=1, X_{\\mathrm{B}}=1) + 0 \\cdot P(\\text{any other combination}) = P(X_{\\mathrm{A}}=1, X_{\\mathrm{B}}=1)$\nThe joint probability $P(X_{\\mathrm{A}}=1, X_{\\mathrm{B}}=1)$ is the frequency of gametes carrying both the 'A' and 'B' alleles, which is precisely the haplotype frequency $P_{\\mathrm{AB}}$.\nSo, $E[X_{\\mathrm{A}}X_{\\mathrm{B}}] = P_{\\mathrm{AB}}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the covariance formula:\n$\\mathrm{Cov}(X_{\\mathrm{A}}, X_{\\mathrm{B}}) = P_{\\mathrm{AB}} - p_{\\mathrm{A}}p_{\\mathrm{B}}$\nThis expression is, by definition, the linkage disequilibrium coefficient, $D$. The problem gives its value as $D = 0.06$.\nTherefore, $\\mathrm{Cov}(X_{\\mathrm{A}}, X_{\\mathrm{B}}) = D = 0.06$.\n\nNow we can assemble the correlation coefficient $r$:\n$$ r = \\frac{D}{\\sqrt{(p_{\\mathrm{A}}p_{\\mathrm{a}}) (p_{\\mathrm{B}}p_{\\mathrm{b}})}} $$\nSubstituting the given and derived numerical values:\n$$ r = \\frac{0.06}{\\sqrt{(0.21)(0.21)}} = \\frac{0.06}{0.21} $$\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we write:\n$$ r = \\frac{6/100}{21/100} = \\frac{6}{21} = \\frac{2}{7} $$\n\nThe square of the correlation coefficient, $r^2$, is then:\n$$ r^2 = \\left(\\frac{2}{7}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{49} $$\n\nFinally, we must interpret $r^2$. In statistics, $r^2$ is the coefficient of determination. It represents the proportion of the variance in one variable that is predictable from the other variable in a linear regression model. In this context of genetics, $r^2=4/49 \\approx 0.0816$ means that approximately $8.16\\%$ of the variance in the allelic state (coded as $0$ or $1$) at one locus can be explained by the allelic state at the other locus.\n\nFor the purpose of \"tagging\" SNPs in genome-wide association studies, a \"tag\" SNP is chosen to serve as a proxy for other nearby SNPs to which it is in high linkage disequilibrium. A high value of $r^2$ (typically a threshold of $r^2  0.8$ is used) indicates a strong correlation, meaning that knowing the genotype of the tag SNP provides significant information about the genotype of the target SNP, thus allowing for accurate imputation. The computed value of $r^2 = 4/49$ is very low. This implies that the association between these two loci is weak. Consequently, using one SNP as a tag for the other would result in a highly inaccurate prediction of its allelic state.

The interpretation is also correct. The formula $r^2 = D^2 / (p_A p_a p_B p_b)$ shows that for a constant $D$, $r^2$ is a function of the product of allele frequencies. The example populations were constructed to have the same $D$ but different allele frequencies, which directly leads to different $r^2$ values. This illustrates the frequency-dependence of $r^2$, making it a more robust statistic for comparing the strength of LD across populations with different allele frequencies than $D$ or $D'$. The reasoning is sound.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Both populations have $D = 0.07$ and $r^2 = 0.07^{2} = 0.0049$, since $r^2$ is just the square of $D$; thus $r^2$ is frequency-independent.\n-   This claim is based on an incorrect definition of $r^2$. It incorrectly assumes $r^2 = D^2$. The denominator $p_A p_a p_B p_b$ is ignored. Consequently, the calculated values for $r^2$ are wrong, and the conclusion that $r^2$ is frequency-independent is false.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Both populations have $D = 0.00$ and $r^2 = 0.00$ given the apparent symmetry of haplotype frequencies; hence there is no linkage disequilibrium.\n-   My calculation showed $D=0.07$ for both populations, which is not zero. Therefore, linkage disequilibrium exists in both populations. The premise that $D=0.00$ is false. The reference to \"apparent symmetry\" is vague and misleading.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. $D$ is the same in both populations, but $r^2$ differs only if recombination rates differ; because recombination is not specified here, $r^2$ must be equal across the two populations.\n-   This statement fundamentally confuses the definition of LD measures with the evolutionary processes that alter them. The recombination rate, $c$, determines the rate of decay of LD over generations ($D_t = D_0 (1-c)^t$), but it is not part of the definition of $r^2$ for a single generation snapshot. The value of $r^2$ depends on $D$ and the allele frequencies, as shown by its definition. My calculations explicitly show that $r^2$ is not equal across the two populations, directly contradicting the conclusion of this option.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nThe only option that presents correct calculations and a scientifically sound interpretation is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2732268"}]}
