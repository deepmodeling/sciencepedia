Mastering this distinction is the first step toward understanding how character data is translated into support for a particular evolutionary history.", "problem": "You are given an alignment of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) characters for $4$ taxa, labeled A, B, C, and D, across $20$ sites. In phylogenetic inference under the principle of Maximum Parsimony (MP), a site is called parsimony-informative if its character-state distribution can discriminate among alternative unrooted tree topologies by implying different minimum numbers of state changes. For DNA characters with four possible nucleotides, assume the following interpretation from first principles: a site is parsimony-informative if and only if at least $2$ distinct nucleotides are present, and each of at least $2$ nucleotides occurs in at least $2$ taxa. Ambiguous characters denoted by N and gaps denoted by - are treated as missing data and do not contribute to counts; a site is counted as parsimony-informative only if the unambiguous observations alone satisfy the stated criterion.\n\nDefine, in your own words, what a parsimony-informative site is based on the above principle, and then compute the total number of parsimony-informative sites in the following alignment.

For $4$ taxa, there are $3$ possible unrooted trees. A site can discriminate among these trees only if it supports a specific grouping of taxa. This requires a character distribution where at least two taxa share one character state, and at least two other taxa share a different character state. The pattern is thus of the form `x-x-y-y`. Any other pattern, such as `x-x-x-x` (invariant), `x-x-x-y` (singleton), or `w-x-y-z` (all unique), will require the same minimum number of changes on all $3$ possible tree topologies and is thus uninformative for selecting the most parsimonious tree.

In reality, datasets are rife with conflicting signals, a phenomenon known as homoplasy. This practice problem introduces the formal concept of character compatibility to determine if a \"perfect phylogeny\"—one with zero homoplasy—is possible for a given dataset. By calculating the minimal required homoplasy, you will learn to quantify the amount of evolutionary conflict inherent in the data, a key metric in evaluating the robustness of a phylogenetic hypothesis.", "problem": "You are given an alignment of $5$ taxa on $4$ unordered, binary, independent morphological characters. For each taxon, the state vector is listed as $\\left(c_{1},c_{2},c_{3},c_{4}\\right)$ with states in $\\{0,1\\}$:\n- Taxon $A$: $\\left(0,0,0,0\\right)$\n- Taxon $B$: $\\left(0,0,1,1\\right)$\n- Taxon $C$: $\\left(0,1,0,1\\right)$\n- Taxon $D$: $\\left(1,0,0,1\\right)$\n- Taxon $E$: $\\left(1,1,1,0\\right)$\n\nA perfect phylogeny is a tree on the taxa where each character is convex, i.e., can be realized with exactly one state change on the tree (or zero if invariant). Under Maximum Parsimony (MP), the most parsimonious tree minimizes the total number of state changes across all characters. Define the minimal homoplasy required for this dataset as the difference between the total number of changes on a most parsimonious tree and the theoretical minimum number of changes if a perfect phylogeny existed (that is, the sum over characters of the per-character lower bound, equal to $1$ for each variable binary character and $0$ for each invariant character).\n\nUsing only the definitions above, and standard properties of character compatibility and parsimony for binary data, determine whether a perfect phylogeny exists for these data. If a perfect phylogeny does not exist, compute the minimum possible total number of changes across all characters on any fully resolved unrooted tree on the $5$ taxa, and hence determine the minimal homoplasy required. Report the minimal homoplasy as a single integer. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of a given morphological dataset for $5$ taxa and $4$ binary characters to determine if a perfect phylogeny exists, and if not, to compute the minimal homoplasy.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the provided data. The taxa are $A, B, C, D, E$. The character state data can be represented by a matrix $M$ where $M_{ij}$ is the state of taxon $i$ for character $c_j$.\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix}\n & c_1 & c_2 & c_3 & c_4 \\\\\nA & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\nB & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\nC & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\nD & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\nE & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nA perfect phylogeny is defined as a tree where every character is convex, which for binary characters means that each character state change occurs exactly once (or zero times if the character is invariant). A perfect phylogeny exists for a set of binary characters if and only if all characters are pairwise compatible. For two binary characters, $c_i$ and $c_j$, compatibility is determined by the four-gamete test: the two characters are compatible if there are no taxa that exhibit all four possible combinations of states $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,1)$.\n\nWe must test the compatibility of all $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ pairs of characters.\n\n1.  Characters $c_1$ and $c_2$:\n    -   Taxon A has state $(0,0)$.\n    -   Taxon C has state $(0,1)$.\n    -   Taxon D has state $(1,0)$.\n    -   Taxon E has state $(1,1)$.\n    All four state combinations are present. Thus, $c_1$ and $c_2$ are incompatible.\n\nSince at least one pair of characters is incompatible, we can immediately conclude that a perfect phylogeny for this dataset does not exist. For completeness, we can verify that all pairs are indeed incompatible.\n2.  $c_1, c_3$: A: $(0,0)$, B: $(0,1)$, D: $(1,0)$, E: $(1,1)$. Incompatible.\n3.  $c_1, c_4$: A: $(0,0)$, B: $(0,1)$, E: $(1,0)$, D: $(1,1)$. Incompatible.\n4.  $c_2, c_3$: A: $(0,0)$, B: $(0,1)$, C: $(1,0)$, E: $(1,1)$. Incompatible.\n5.  $c_2, c_4$: A: $(0,0)$, E: $(1,0)$, B: $(0,1)$, C: $(1,1)$. Incompatible.\n6.  $c_3, c_4$: A: $(0,0)$, E: $(1,0)$, C: $(0,1)$, B: $(1,1)$. Incompatible.\n\nAs every pair of characters is incompatible, a perfect phylogeny does not exist.\n\nThe next step is to find the minimum possible total number of changes on any fully resolved unrooted tree, which is the parsimony score of the most parsimonious tree (MPT). The parsimony score of a tree $T$, denoted $L(T)$, is the sum of the minimum number of changes (lengths) required for each character on that tree: $L(T) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} l_i(T)$.\n\nThe theoretical minimum number of changes for a single character is the number of its states minus one. All four characters are variable (possess both states $0$ and $1$), so the lower bound for each character's length is $l_i \\ge 2-1 = 1$. The theoretical minimum total score, achievable only if a perfect phylogeny exists, is the sum of these lower bounds: $L_{min, theoretical} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} 1 = 4$.\n\nSince a perfect phylogeny does not exist, the actual MPT score will be greater than $4$. The fact that any two characters $c_i$ and $c_j$ are incompatible means that no single phylogenetic tree can exist where both characters are realized with the minimum of one change. In other words, for any tree $T$, it is not possible that both $l_i(T)=1$ and $l_j(T)=1$. Since all pairs of characters are incompatible, at most one character can have a length of $1$ on any given tree.\n\nWe can analyze the minimum possible tree length $L_{MPT}$ by considering two cases for an arbitrary tree $T$:\nCase 1: No character has a length of $1$. In this case, $l_i(T) \\ge 2$ for all $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$. The total length would be $L(T) \\ge 2+2+2+2 = 8$.\nCase 2: Exactly one character has a length of $1$. Let us assume $l_k(T)=1$ for some character $c_k$. Since all other characters $c_j$ (where $j \\neq k$) are incompatible with $c_k$, their lengths must be greater than $1$, i.e., $l_j(T) \\ge 2$. The total length would be $L(T) \\ge 1 + (2+2+2) = 7$.\n\nComparing the two cases, the minimum possible parsimony score is $\\min(8, 7) = 7$, provided that a tree with a score of $7$ actually exists. A score of $7$ is achieved if there is a tree topology where one character has length $1$ and the other three each have length $2$.\n\nLet's test this by constructing a tree. For a character to have length $1$, its corresponding bipartition of the taxa must be represented by an edge in the tree. The split for character $c_1$ is $\\{A,B,C\\}|\\{D,E\\}$. A tree containing this split is, for example, $T_1 = ((A,B),(C,(D,E)))$. This tree has two internal edges, corresponding to the splits $\\{A,B\\}|\\{C,D,E\\}$ and $\\{D,E\\}|\\{A,B,C\\}$. Since the split for $c_1$ is present, $l_1(T_1)=1$. We now calculate the lengths for the other characters on this tree using the Fitch algorithm.\n\n-   $l_1(T_1)$: By construction, this is $1$.\n-   $l_2(T_1)$: For character $c_2$ with states $A(0), B(0), C(1), D(0), E(1)$.\n    -   An upward pass from the leaves gives cost: $cost((D,E)) = 1$, $cost((C,(D,E))) = 0$, $cost((A,B)) = 0$, $cost(root) = 1$. Total cost: $1+1=2$.\n-   $l_3(T_1)$: For character $c_3$ with states $A(0), B(1), C(0), D(0), E(1)$.\n    -   Upward pass: $cost((D,E))=1$, $cost((C,(D,E)))=0$, $cost((A,B))=1$, $cost(root)=0$. Total cost: $1+1=2$.\n-   $l_4(T_1)$: For character $c_4$ with states $A(0), B(1), C(1), D(1), E(0)$.\n    -   Upward pass: $cost((D,E))=1$, $cost((C,(D,E)))=0$, $cost((A,B))=1$, $cost(root)=0$. Total cost: $1+1=2$.\n\nThe total length for tree $T_1$ is $L(T_1) = 1+2+2+2 = 7$. Since we have demonstrated that any tree must have a score of at least $7$, and we have found a tree with a score of $7$, the minimum possible total number of changes is $7$.\n\nFinally, we compute the minimal homoplasy. Homoplasy is the number of character changes on a tree in excess of the theoretical minimum.\n$$ \\text{Minimal Homoplasy} = L_{MPT} - L_{min, theoretical} $$\nWe found $L_{MPT} = 7$ and $L_{min, theoretical} = 4$.\n$$ \\text{Minimal Homoplasy} = 7 - 4 = 3 $$\nThis represents the three extra steps required due to the incompatibilities among the characters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2731406"}, {"introduction": "The standard \"Fitch\" or unordered parsimony model is agnostic about the direction or type of evolutionary change, but biological reality is often more constrained.

No reversals are needed. The score is $1$.\n- Dollo parsimony: A single gain $0 \\to 1$ is posited on the branch to $N_{2}$. This requires no subsequent losses ($1 \\to 0$).

This set forms a paraphyletic group, as it constitutes the clade descending from $N_{4}$ but excludes taxon $E$.\n- Unordered parsimony: The most parsimonious explanation is a single gain $0 \\to 1$ on the branch leading to $N_{4}$, followed by a single reversal $1 \\to 0$ on the branch leading to $E$. The score is $1$ (gain) $+ 1$ (reversal) $= 2$.\n- Camin-Sokal parsimony: Reversals are forbidden.

The score is $3$.\n- Dollo parsimony: The single gain is placed on the branch to the MRCA of $\\{C, D, F\\}$, which is $N_{4}$. To account for $E=0$, a single loss $1 \\to 0$ is required on the branch to $E$. The score is $1$ (gain) $+ 1$ (loss) $= 2$.\n\nCharacter $5$: The state vector is $(1,1,0,0,1,1)$.\nThe taxa with state $1$ are $\\{A, B, E, F\\}$.

The score is $1$ (gain) $+ 0$ (losses) $= 1$.\n\nSummary of scores:\n- For Camin-Sokal parsimony, the total score is $S_{\\mathrm{CS}} = 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 11$.\n- For Dollo parsimony, the total score is $S_{\\mathrm{Dollo}} = 1 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14$.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of $\\Delta = S_{\\mathrm{Dollo}} - S_{\\mathrm{CS}}$.\n$\\Delta = 14 - 11 = 3$.\n\nBrief justification of permissiveness:\n- Unordered parsimony is the most permissive model as it places no restrictions on the direction of change, always yielding a score less than or equal to the other two criteria.\n- Camin-Sokal parsimony (multiple gains, no losses) is more permissive than Dollo parsimony for polyphyletic character distributions (e.g., character $3$). It explains such patterns via a few convergent gains, whereas Dollo is severely penalized by requiring a single, deep gain and numerous subsequent losses.\n- Dollo parsimony (one gain, multiple losses) is more permissive than Camin-Sokal parsimony for paraphyletic distributions (e.g., character $4$). Dollo elegantly explains this with one gain followed by a few losses, while Camin-Sokal, forbidding losses, must invoke multiple independent gains, leading to a higher score.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3}\n$$", "id": "2731367"}]}
