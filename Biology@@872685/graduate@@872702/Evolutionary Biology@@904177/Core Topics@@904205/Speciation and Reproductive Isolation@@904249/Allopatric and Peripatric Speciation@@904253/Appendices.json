It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. There are no flaws in its formulation. We will proceed with the derivation and calculation as requested.\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts. We will address each in turn.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the expected pairwise divergence $d_{XY}$.\nWe consider two haploid genomes, one sampled from population $X$ and one from population $Y$. We trace the ancestry of these two lineages backward in time. The populations $X$ and $Y$ have been isolated for $T$ generations. For this duration, the two lineages reside in separate populations and cannot coalesce. The total time elapsed on these two lineages during the allopatric phase is $T$ generations for the lineage from $X$ and $T$ generations for the lineage from $Y$, summing to a total of $2T$ generations of independent evolution.\n\nAt time $T$ generations in the past, both lineages enter the common ancestral population, which has a constant effective size of $N_{eA}$. Under the standard Wright-Fisher model for a diploid population, the probability that two randomly chosen lineages coalesce in any given generation is $\\frac{1}{2N_{eA}}$. The time until coalescence, $T_c$, is a geometrically distributed random variable with success probability $p = \\frac{1}{2N_{eA}}$. The expected time to coalescence within this ancestral population is therefore $E[T_c] = \\frac{1}{p} = 2N_{eA}$ generations.\n\nThe total expected time from the present to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the two sampled lineages, $E[T_{MRCA}]$, is the sum of the time spent in the separate populations and the expected time to coalescence within the ancestral population:\n$$E[T_{MRCA}] = T + E[T_c] = T + 2N_{eA}$$\n\nThe total length of the genealogy connecting the two lineages, from the tips (present day) to their MRCA, is twice the time to the MRCA. Let this total expected branch length be denoted $E[L_{total}]$.\n$$E[L_{total}] = 2 \\times E[T_{MRCA}] = 2(T + 2N_{eA}) = 2T + 4N_{eA}$$\n\nUnder the infinite-sites model, mutations accumulate as a Poisson process along the branches of the genealogy at a constant rate $\\mu$ per site per generation. The expected number of substitutions per site, $d_{XY}$, is the product of the total expected branch length and the mutation rate.\n$$d_{XY} = E[L_{total}] \\times \\mu = (2T + 4N_{eA})\\mu = 2\\mu T + 4N_{eA}\\mu$$\n\nThe problem defines the ancestral population genetics parameter as $\\theta_A = 4N_{eA}\\mu$. Substituting this definition into our expression for $d_{XY}$:\n$$d_{XY} = 2\\mu T + \\theta_{A}$$\nThis completes the required derivation for the first part.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of an estimator for the split time $T$.\nWe begin with the relationship derived in Part 1:\n$$d_{XY} = 2\\mu T + \\theta_A$$\nOur goal is to express $T$ in terms of the other parameters. This is a simple algebraic rearrangement.\n$$d_{XY} - \\theta_A = 2\\mu T$$\n$$T = \\frac{d_{XY} - \\theta_A}{2\\mu}$$\nTo form an estimator for $T$, denoted $\\hat{T}$, we replace the theoretical quantity $d_{XY}$ with its empirical estimate, $\\hat{d}_{XY}$. The value $\\hat{d}_{XY}$ is calculated as the number of observed pairwise differences, $D$, divided by the total number of aligned sites, $L$. The parameters $\\theta_A$ and $\\mu$ are given as known constants.\nThus, the estimator for the split time is:\n$$\\hat{T} = \\frac{\\hat{d}_{XY} - \\theta_A}{2\\mu}$$\nwhere $\\hat{d}_{XY} = \\frac{D}{L}$. This completes the second part.\n\nPart 3: Numerical estimation of the split time $T$.\nWe are provided with the following data:\n-   Number of aligned sites, $L = 3.0 \\times 10^{6}$.\n-   Number of pairwise differences, $D = 6.6 \\times 10^{4}$.\n-   Per-site, per-generation mutation rate, $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}$.\n-   Ancestral population parameter, $\\theta_A = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the estimate of pairwise divergence, $\\hat{d}_{XY}$:\n$$\\hat{d}_{XY} = \\frac{D}{L} = \\frac{6.6 \\times 10^{4}}{3.0 \\times 10^{6}} = 2.2 \\times 10^{-2}$$\n\nNext, we substitute $\\hat{d}_{XY}$ and the given values for $\\theta_A$ and $\\mu$ into our estimator for $T$:\n$$\\hat{T} = \\frac{\\hat{d}_{XY} - \\theta_A}{2\\mu} = \\frac{(2.2 \\times 10^{-2}) - (2.0 \\times 10^{-3})}{2 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-8})}$$\n\nWe perform the calculation. The numerator is:\n$$2.2 \\times 10^{-2} - 2.0 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.022 - 0.002 = 0.020 = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}$$\nThe denominator is:\n$$2 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-8}) = 2.0 \\times 10^{-8}$$\nNow we compute the final ratio:\n$$\\hat{T} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-2}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-8}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6}$$\nThe estimated split time is $1,000,000$ generations.

It describes a classic scenario in theoretical population genetics, utilizing standard models like the Wright–Fisher process and the diffusion approximation. The premise of fixation of an underdominant allele in a small population due to genetic drift is a valid and important concept in evolutionary biology, particularly in models of speciation. The provided information is self-contained and sufficient to derive a unique solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nSolution:\nLet $P_{neutral}$ be the fixation probability of a new neutral allele. The problem gives this as:\n$$ P_{neutral} = \\frac{1}{2N_e} $$\nThis corresponds to a new mutation arising in a single copy, with initial frequency $p_0 = \\frac{1}{2N_e}$ in a diploid population of effective size $N_e$.\n\nLet $P_{fix}(s_h)$ be the fixation probability of the underdominant inversion. The problem states that the inversion is deleterious when rare and that its fixation probability is exponentially suppressed relative to the neutral case. The suppression factor is proportional to the product $N_e s_h$. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$ P_{fix}(s_h) = P_{neutral} \\cdot \\exp(-k N_e s_h) $$\nfor some constant of proportionality $k$. For a slightly deleterious allele with a constant selection coefficient $s$ against it, the established diffusion approximation for its fixation probability is $P_{fix}(s) \\approx P_{neutral} \\exp(-2 N_e s)$. In the case of an underdominant allele with heterozygote fitness $1-s_h$ (relative to a wild-type homozygote fitness of $1$), when the allele is rare, it is predominantly found in heterozygotes. Thus, it experiences an effective selection coefficient against it of magnitude $s_h$. We therefore adopt the standard approximation where the constant of proportionality is $k=2$. The model for the fixation probability of the inversion is:\n$$ P_{fix}(s_h) = \\frac{1}{2N_e} \\exp(-2 N_e s_h) $$\nThe problem defines the condition for drift to potentially drive the inversion to fixation as its fixation probability being at least a fraction $r$ of the neutral probability. We can write this as an inequality:\n$$ P_{fix}(s_h) \\ge r \\cdot P_{neutral} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the probabilities yields:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2N_e} \\exp(-2 N_e s_h) \\ge r \\left( \\frac{1}{2N_e} \\right) $$\nSince $N_e$ is a population size, it is positive, and thus $\\frac{1}{2N_e}$ is positive. We can multiply both sides by $2N_e$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$ \\exp(-2 N_e s_h) \\ge r $$\nTo solve for the relationship including $s_h$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides. The natural logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, so the inequality direction is preserved:\n$$ \\ln(\\exp(-2 N_e s_h)) \\ge \\ln(r) $$\n$$ -2 N_e s_h \\ge \\ln(r) $$\nTo isolate $s_h$, we must divide by $-2 N_e$. Since $N_e  0$, the term $-2N_e$ is negative. Dividing an inequality by a negative number reverses the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$ s_h \\le \\frac{\\ln(r)}{-2 N_e} $$\n$$ s_h \\le -\\frac{\\ln(r)}{2 N_e} $$\nThis is the analytical condition relating $N_e$, $s_h$, and $r$. This can also be written as $s_h \\le \\frac{\\ln(1/r)}{2 N_e}$.

The threshold $c^{*}$ is the value of the cost $c$ at which these two fitness values are equal, i.e., $W_A = W_a$.\n\nFirst, we must formulate the expression for the absolute fitness of a non-carrier, $W_a$.
