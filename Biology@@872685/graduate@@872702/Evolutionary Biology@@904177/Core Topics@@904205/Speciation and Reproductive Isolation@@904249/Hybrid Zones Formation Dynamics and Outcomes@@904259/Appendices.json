At steady state (a stationary cline), this PDE reduces to an ordinary differential equation for $p(x)$, which you may assume is smooth and monotone.

This is a classic problem in theoretical population genetics, formulated as a reaction-diffusion system. We will proceed by first establishing the governing equation, solving it for the steady-state condition, and then using the provided definition of cline width to find the desired expression.\n\nFirst, we formulate the reaction-diffusion equation for the allele frequency $p(x,t)$. The change in allele frequency per unit time, $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}$, is the sum of changes due to dispersal and selection.\n\nThe dispersal process is given as approximately Gaussian with variance $\\sigma^2$ per generation. In a continuous model, this corresponds to a diffusion process. The problem statement provides the diffusion term directly as $\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2}$.\n\nThe selection process occurs within local demes. We are given the Malthusian fitnesses (or viabilities) for the three genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ as $w_{AA}=1$, $w_{Aa}=1-s$, and $w_{aa}=1$, where $s$ is the selection coefficient against the heterozygote and $0  s \\ll 1$. Assuming local random mating, the genotype frequencies before selection are given by Hardy-Weinberg proportions: $p^2$ for $AA$, $2p(1-p)$ for $Aa$, and $(1-p)^2$ for $aa$.\n\nThe mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$, is the average of the genotype fitnesses weighted by their frequencies:\n$$ \\bar{w} = p^2 w_{AA} + 2p(1-p)w_{Aa} + (1-p)^2 w_{aa} $$\n$$ \\bar{w} = p^2(1) + 2p(1-p)(1-s) + (1-p)^2(1) $$\n$$ \\bar{w} = p^2 + 2p(1-p) - 2sp(1-p) + (1-p)^2 $$\n$$ \\bar{w} = (p^2 + 2p(1-p) + (1-p)^2) - 2sp(1-p) $$\nSince $p^2 + 2p(1-p) + (1-p)^2 = (p + (1-p))^2 = 1^2 = 1$, we have:\n$$ \\bar{w} = 1 - 2sp(1-p) $$\n\nThe frequency of allele $A$ in the next generation, $p'$, after selection is the frequency of $A$ alleles among the survivors:\n$$ p' = \\frac{p^2 w_{AA} + p(1-p)w_{Aa}}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{p^2(1) + p(1-p)(1-s)}{1 - 2sp(1-p)} = \\frac{p - sp(1-p)}{1 - 2sp(1-p)} $$\n\nThe change in allele frequency due to selection in one generation is $\\Delta_s p = p' - p$:\n$$ \\Delta_s p = \\frac{p - sp(1-p)}{1 - 2sp(1-p)} - p = \\frac{p - sp(1-p) - p(1 - 2sp(1-p))}{1 - 2sp(1-p)} $$\n$$ \\Delta_s p = \\frac{-sp(1-p) + 2sp^2(1-p)}{1 - 2sp(1-p)} = \\frac{sp(1-p)(2p-1)}{1 - 2sp(1-p)} $$\n\nFor weak selection, where $s \\ll 1$, the denominator $\\bar{w} = 1 - 2sp(1-p) \\approx 1$.

The assumptions, such as the negligible effect of drift and the specific form of selection, are intentional simplifications common in theoretical modeling to ensure mathematical tractability. The problem is a non-trivial application of probability theory to evolutionary genetics. Therefore, the problem statement is deemed **valid**. We may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem is separated into two parts. We will solve Part A first to establish the neutral expectation, and then solve Part B by incorporating selection. The final answer required is for Part B.\n\n**Part A: Neutral Model**\n\nWe model the process of recombination breaking down migrant ancestry tracts over time. An initial migrant chromosome is introduced at a time $t$ generations in the past. In each subsequent generation, a gamete's chromosome is a mosaic formed through meiosis, where recombination events can occur between the parental homologous chromosomes.\n\nThe problem states that recombination breakpoints occur as a homogeneous Poisson process with rate $r$ per base pair per generation. We are considering the ancestry of chromosome segments in the present day. A segment has migrant ancestry if its entire lineage back to the initial admixture event consists of migrant-derived genetic material. A breakpoint at any generation in this lineage, at any point along the segment, would disrupt this continuity.\n\nConsider the collection of all recombination breakpoints that have occurred in the ancestral lineage of a single chromosome over the past $t$ generations. Since recombination events are independent across generations, the set of all breakpoints accumulated over $t$ generations is a superposition of $t$ independent homogeneous Poisson processes, each with rate $r$. The superposition of independent Poisson processes results in a new Poisson process whose rate is the sum of the individual rates.\n\nTherefore, the locations of all historical recombination breakpoints that define the boundaries of today's ancestry tracts can be described by a single homogeneous Poisson process with a total rate $\\rho$ given by:\n$$ \\rho = \\sum_{i=1}^{t} r = rt $$\nThis rate $\\rho$ has units of breakpoints per base pair over the total $t$-generation history.\n\nA fundamental property of a homogeneous Poisson process is that the distances between consecutive events—in this case, the lengths of the undisrupted ancestry tracts—are independent and identically distributed random variables following an exponential distribution. The rate parameter of this exponential distribution is equal to the rate of the Poisson process, $\\rho = rt$.\n\nThe probability density function (PDF) for the length $\\ell$ of a randomly sampled migrant ancestry tract is thus:\n$$ p_{\\text{neutral}}(\\ell) = \\rho \\exp(-\\rho \\ell) = (rt) \\exp(-rt\\ell) $$\nfor $\\ell \\ge 0$.\n\nThe expected mean length of a tract, $E[\\ell]$, is the expected value of this exponential distribution, which is the reciprocal of its rate parameter:\n$$ E[\\ell]_{\\text{neutral}} = \\frac{1}{\\rho} = \\frac{1}{rt} $$\nThis completes the derivation for the neutral case.\n\n**Part B: Model with Selection**\n\nNow, we introduce selection against migrant ancestry. The problem specifies a particular form of selection: \"in each generation, a chromosome carrying migrant ancestry over a present-day length $\\ell$ experiences a multiplicative survival factor $\\exp(-s\\ell)$\". This phrasing implies that the total selective effect on the lineage of a tract is determined by its final, observed length $\\ell$. This is a modeling simplification.\n\nWith multiplicative fitness across generations, the total survival probability, $P(\\text{survival}|\\ell)$, for a lineage that results in a tract of length $\\ell$ today, over the course of $t$ generations, is:\n$$ P(\\text{survival}|\\ell) = \\left( \\exp(-s\\ell) \\right)^{t} = \\exp(-st\\ell) $$\nThis selection acts as a filter on the distribution of tract lengths generated by recombination. Longer tracts are more strongly selected against and are therefore less likely to be observed in the present-day population. We are asked for the expected length conditional on survival.\n\nWe can solve this using a Bayesian approach. The neutral distribution of tract lengths, $p_{\\text{neutral}}(\\ell)$, serves as our prior distribution. The survival probability, $P(\\text{survival}|\\ell)$, acts as the likelihood of observing a tract of length $\\ell$. The posterior distribution, $p_{\\text{sel}}(\\ell)$, is the distribution of lengths of tracts that have survived and are observed today.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior distribution is proportional to the product of the prior and the likelihood:\n$$ p_{\\text{sel}}(\\ell) \\propto p_{\\text{neutral}}(\\ell) \\times P(\\text{survival}|\\ell) $$\nSubstituting the expressions we have derived:\n$$ p_{\\text{sel}}(\\ell) \\propto \\left( (rt) \\exp(-rt\\ell) \\right) \\times \\left( \\exp(-st\\ell) \\right) $$\nThe constant pre-factor $(rt)$ can be absorbed into the proportionality constant. We combine the exponential terms:\n$$ p_{\\text{sel}}(\\ell) \\propto \\exp(-rt\\ell) \\exp(-st\\ell) = \\exp(-(rt+st)\\ell) $$\n$$ p_{\\text{sel}}(\\ell) \\propto \\exp(-(r+s)t\\ell) $$\nThis functional form is the kernel of an exponential distribution. The new rate parameter, $\\lambda'$, is:\n$$ \\lambda' = (r+s)t $$\nTo find the normalized PDF, we introduce a normalization constant $C$ such that $\\int_0^\\infty C \\exp(-\\lambda'\\ell) d\\ell = 1$. This yields $C = \\lambda' = (r+s)t$. Thus, the distribution of migrant ancestry tract lengths under selection, conditional on survival, is:\n$$ p_{\\text{sel}}(\\ell) = (r+s)t \\exp(-(r+s)t\\ell) $$\nThis is an exponential distribution with rate $\\lambda' = (r+s)t$.\n\nThe expected mean length of a tract sampled from this distribution, $\\ell$, is the reciprocal of the rate parameter $\\lambda'$:\n$$ E[\\ell]_{\\text{sel}} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda'} = \\frac{1}{(r+s)t} $$\nThis expression gives the modified expected mean tract length as a function of the recombination rate $r$, the selection coefficient per base pair $s$, and the time since admixture $t$. As expected, the introduction of negative selection ($s > 0$) reduces the expected tract length compared to the neutral case.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{1}{(r+s)t}} $$", "id": "2725611"}]}
