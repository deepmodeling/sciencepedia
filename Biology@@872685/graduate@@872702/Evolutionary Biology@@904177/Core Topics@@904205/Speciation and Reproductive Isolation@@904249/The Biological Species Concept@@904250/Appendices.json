Consider two allopatric populations of freshwater fish, Population 1 (P1) and Population 2 (P2), that have diverged from a common ancestral population. The ancestral population was genetically fixed with genotype $A_1A_1 B_1B_1$. Through evolutionary time, a new allele $A_2$ arose and fixed in P1, while a new allele $B_2$ arose and fixed in P2. Both loci, A and B, are autosomal and unlinked. Thus, the modern populations have genotypes P1: $A_2A_2 B_1B_1$ and P2: $A_1A_1 B_2B_2$.\n\nA research team performs crosses between these populations.

Under a neutral Wright–Fisher island model at drift–migration equilibrium with symmetric migration, gene flow counteracts the build-up of genetic differentiation between demes. Consider two demes of equal long-term effective size $N$ exchanging migrants at a constant per-generation rate $m$ (proportion of each deme replaced by migrants each generation). Assume the following biologically realistic conditions: neutral markers, symmetric migration, constant $N$, negligible mutation compared to migration, and equilibrium between genetic drift and migration.\n\nYou measure a standardized genetic differentiation of $F_{ST}=0.2$ between the demes at neutral loci and independently estimate the effective size per deme as $N=10^{4}$.

The model specified is the symmetric two-island model, for which Sewall Wright derived a well-established formula for the fixation index, $F_{ST}$. The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and complete, allowing for a direct solution.\n\nThe standardized measure of genetic differentiation, $F_{ST}$, for a diploid island model with two demes of equal effective size $N$ and a symmetric migration rate $m$ at equilibrium is given by the approximation:\n$$ F_{ST} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 4Nm} $$\nThis equation quantifies the balance between genetic drift, which increases differentiation, and gene flow (migration), which homogenizes gene pools. The term $Nm$ represents the effective number of migrants entering a deme per generation.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Measured genetic differentiation: $F_{ST} = 0.2$\n- Effective population size per deme: $N = 10^4$\n\nOur first objective is to infer the per-generation migration rate, $m$. We rearrange the formula for $F_{ST}$ to solve for $m$.\nStarting with the equation:\n$$ F_{ST} = \\frac{1}{1 + 4Nm} $$\nWe can isolate the term containing $m$:\n$$ 1 + 4Nm = \\frac{1}{F_{ST}} $$\n$$ 4Nm = \\frac{1}{F_{ST}} - 1 $$\n$$ m = \\frac{1}{4N} \\left( \\frac{1}{F_{ST}} - 1 \\right) $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.

The criterion is:\n- $I = 1$ if $Nm \\ge 1$\n- $I = 0$ if $Nm < 1$\n\nWe calculate the product $Nm$ using the given value for $N$ and our calculated value for $m$:\n$$ Nm = (10^4) \\times (10^{-4}) = 10^{4-4} = 10^0 = 1 $$\nSince the value of $Nm$ is exactly $1$, it satisfies the condition $Nm \\ge 1$.

This final practice moves from simple models to the integrative challenge of empirical data interpretation. You are tasked with acting as a genomic detective to distinguish between two competing historical scenarios: continuous gene flow versus allopatry followed by secondary contact [@problem_id:1968520]. By synthesizing patterns of linkage disequilibrium, the joint allele frequency spectrum, and genome-wide differentiation ($F_{ST}$), you will learn how different speciation processes leave distinct, predictable footprints in the genome, a core skill in contemporary speciation research.", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying the speciation history of two closely related, geographically adjacent species of songbirds, *Aves alpha* and *Aves beta*. The Biological Species Concept (BSC) defines species as groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups. However, the process of speciation can be complex, and reproductive isolation may be incomplete. The biologist aims to distinguish between two competing hypotheses for the history of these two species using whole-genome sequencing data from multiple individuals of each species.\n\nThe two hypotheses are:\n1.  **Model I: Primary Divergence with Gene Flow.** The ancestral population split into two, but the diverging populations have continuously exchanged genes at a low rate throughout their history.\n2.  **Model II: Allopatric Divergence with Secondary Contact.** The ancestral population split and evolved in complete geographic isolation (allopatry) for a long period, allowing for substantial divergence. Subsequently, their geographic ranges expanded, bringing them back into contact and allowing for recent gene flow (introgression).\n\nThe analysis of the whole-genome data reveals three key patterns:\n\n**Observation 1: Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Decay.**\nLD, the non-random association of alleles at different genomic loci, is measured as a function of the physical distance between pairs of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). The analysis shows that for both species, LD decays rapidly with distance, as expected. However, for inter-population comparisons (LD calculated between an allele from *A. alpha* and an allele from *A. beta*), there is a distinct pattern: on top of a baseline of low LD, there are numerous genomic blocks, hundreds of kilobases in length, within which LD between the species is unusually high. These high-LD blocks are found in individuals from the geographic contact zone.\n\n**Observation 2: The Joint Allele Frequency Spectrum (JAFS).**\nThe JAFS is a two-dimensional histogram that counts the number of SNPs found at every possible combination of allele frequencies in the two species. The observed JAFS shows a very high number of SNPs that are \"fixed differences\"—where one allele is present in all sampled individuals of *A. alpha* and an alternative allele is present in all sampled individuals of *A. beta*. The JAFS also shows a significant excess of \"asymmetrically shared\" SNPs: these are SNPs where the derived allele is at very high frequency (e.g., > 95%) in one species but is present as a very rare allele (e.g., found in only one or two individuals) in the other species. There are relatively few shared SNPs where the derived allele is at an intermediate frequency in both species simultaneously.\n\n**Observation 3: Genomic Architecture of Divergence.**\nThe biologist measured genetic differentiation ($F_{ST}$) in sliding windows across the genome. The analysis reveals that regions of high differentiation are very large, often spanning entire chromosome arms, and are distributed across all chromosomes. There are no small, localized \"islands\" of extreme differentiation surrounded by a \"sea\" of low differentiation. Instead, the genome appears as a mosaic of large, highly diverged blocks and large, less-diverged blocks (which correspond to the high-LD regions from Observation 1).\n\nBased on a synthesis of these three observations, which of the following conclusions about the speciation history of *Aves alpha* and *Aves beta* is most strongly supported?\n\nA. The evidence is contradictory and cannot distinguish between Model I and Model II.\n\nB. Model I is supported, as the presence of inter-population LD and shared polymorphisms indicates a long history of continuous gene flow that has maintained genomic similarity.\n\nC. Model II is supported, as the combination of many fixed differences, asymmetrically shared rare alleles, and long-range inter-population LD blocks points to a long period of isolation followed by recent hybridization.\n\nD. A model of sympatric speciation is most likely, where strong disruptive selection created two species from a single population without geographic isolation, and the observed patterns reflect this ongoing selective process.\n\nE. A simple model of strict allopatric divergence without any subsequent gene flow is supported, as indicated by the high number of fixed differences across the genome.", "solution": "We begin by translating the qualitative genomic observations into the expected signatures under the two demographic models.\n\nFirst, linkage disequilibrium. Within a population, linkage disequilibrium $D$ between loci separated by recombination fraction $r$ decays with generations $t$ according to $D_{t} = (1-r)^{t} D_{0} \\approx \\exp(-r t) D_{0}$ for small $r$. Under admixture, introgressed ancestry is inherited in contiguous haplotype tracts whose lengths have an exponential distribution with mean $\\ell = \\frac{1}{r t}$, where $t$ is the time since admixture and $r$ is the per-base recombination rate per generation. Therefore, long tracts (hundreds of kilobases) of high inter-population LD are a hallmark of recent introgression (small $t$), and their spatial restriction to the contact zone implies geographically localized recent hybridization. Under Model I (primary divergence with continuous gene flow over a long time), recombination would have repeatedly broken down introgressed haplotypes, producing predominantly short tracts and a diffuse pattern of low inter-population LD rather than numerous long, high-LD blocks. Observation 1 therefore supports recent secondary contact and introgression, not prolonged continuous gene flow.\n\nSecond, the joint allele frequency spectrum. With prolonged isolation without gene flow for time $T$, neutral divergence accumulates, and the expected number of fixed differences per site scales as $D \\propto \\mu T$ (more precisely, approximately $2 \\mu T$ under a simple neutral model with mutation rate $\\mu$), generating many fixed differences in the JAFS corners. If secondary contact is recent, alleles introduced by introgression should appear at low frequency in the recipient population, creating an excess of asymmetrically shared SNPs: very high frequency (near one) in one species but rare (near zero) in the other, localized in the off-diagonal corners of the JAFS. By contrast, under Model I with continuous migration, gene flow over long periods homogenizes allele frequencies, reduces the number of fixed differences, and increases the abundance of shared polymorphisms at intermediate frequencies along the JAFS diagonal. Observation 2, which shows many fixed differences plus a strong excess of asymmetrically shared rare alleles and few shared intermediate-frequency polymorphisms, is therefore expected under long allopatry followed by recent introgression (Model II), and is inconsistent with long-term continuous gene flow (Model I).\n\nThird, the genomic architecture of divergence. Sliding-window $F_{ST}$ reflects heterogeneity in divergence along the genome. Under continuous gene flow, neutral regions are homogenized, and high $F_{ST}$ should be concentrated in relatively small regions directly or indirectly linked to targets of divergent selection, producing narrow “islands” of differentiation embedded in a low-divergence background. Under long allopatry, divergence accumulates broadly across the genome, often producing large regions of high $F_{ST}$. Upon recent secondary contact, introgressed haplotypes reduce divergence in the specific tracts that have crossed the species boundary; these less-diverged tracts coincide with high inter-population LD because recombination has had little time to break them down. The observed mosaic of very large, highly diverged blocks interspersed with large, less-diverged, high-LD blocks spanning hundreds of kilobases to chromosome-arm scales fits precisely the expectation for long isolation followed by recent introgression. It does not match the expectation of Model I, which would predict smaller, localized peaks of high $F_{ST}$ rather than chromosome-arm-scale blocks distributed across all chromosomes.\n\nThese three lines of evidence jointly reject a strict allopatry-without-gene-flow model (because there is clear evidence of introgression: high inter-population LD tracts and asymmetrically shared alleles) and also reject continuous gene flow (because there are many fixed differences, few shared intermediate-frequency variants, and large-scale LD tracts indicative of recent, not ancient, admixture). A sympatric speciation scenario is unnecessary to explain the data and is not supported by the specific genomic signatures observed.\n\nTherefore, the synthesis of LD tract length and decay, JAFS shape, and genome-wide $F_{ST}$ architecture most strongly supports Model II: long allopatric divergence followed by recent secondary contact with introgression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1968520"}]}
