All assumptions—Mendelian genetics, independent assortment for unlinked loci, and random mating—are standard in introductory genetics problems.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated. The initial conditions (parental genotypes), the crossing scheme ($P \\rightarrow F_1 \\rightarrow F_2$), and the specific question (frequency of a particular $F_2$ genotype) are all precisely defined. The assumptions provided are sufficient to arrive at a unique, deterministic answer.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is formal, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nThe problem is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically sound. The term \"complete hybrid breakdown\" correctly refers to a postzygotic incompatibility. The question asks for the fraction of $F_2$ individuals that *carry* the specified genotype, which corresponds to the genotypic frequency expected among zygotes *before* any selection (i.e., the breakdown itself) has acted. This is a standard and unambiguous way to frame such a question. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will now be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds by applying fundamental principles of Mendelian genetics.\n\n**Parental (P) Generation and First Filial ($F_{1}$) Generation:**\nThe parental populations have fixed genotypes. Population $X$ has the genotype $A_{1}A_{1}B_{1}B_{1}$ and produces only $A_{1}B_{1}$ gametes. Population $Y$ has the genotype $A_{2}A_{2}B_{2}B_{2}$ and produces only $A_{2}B_{2}$ gametes.\nThe cross between a representative from population $X$ and a representative from population $Y$ is:\n$$A_{1}A_{1}B_{1}B_{1} \\times A_{2}A_{2}B_{2}B_{2}$$\nAll resulting first filial ($F_{1}$) generation individuals will be dihybrid, with the genotype:\n$$A_{1}A_{2}B_{1}B_{2}$$\nThese individuals are fully viable as they do not possess the incompatible genotype.\n\n**Gamete Production by the $F_{1}$ Generation:**\nThe $F_1$ individuals have genotype $A_{1}A_{2}B_{1}B_{2}$. The problem states that the loci $L_A$ and $L_B$ are unlinked ($r = \\frac{1}{2}$), meaning they assort independently during meiosis. According to the law of independent assortment, an $F_1$ individual will produce four types of gametes in equal proportions. The frequency of each gamete type is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe four gamete types and their frequencies are:\n- $p(A_{1}B_{1}) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- $p(A_{1}B_{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- $p(A_{2}B_{1}) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- $p(A_{2}B_{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\n**Second Filial ($F_{2}$) Generation Genotype Frequencies:**\nThe second filial ($F_{2}$) generation is produced by the random mating of $F_{1}$ individuals among themselves. Because the population is large and mating is random, the expected genotype frequencies in the $F_2$ generation can be calculated by treating the process as independent segregation at each locus.\n\nWe can analyze the inheritance at each locus separately. For a given locus, say $L_A$, the random mating of $F_1$ individuals is equivalent to a large number of $A_{1}A_{2} \\times A_{1}A_{2}$ crosses.\n\n1.  **Frequency of the $A_{1}A_{1}$ genotype at locus $L_{A}$**:\n    The allele frequencies for $A_1$ and $A_2$ in the $F_1$ gamete pool are both $\\frac{1}{2}$. Under random mating (equivalent to a monohybrid cross here), the expected genotype frequencies at locus $L_A$ are given by standard Mendelian ratios:\n    - $p(A_{1}A_{1}) = p(A_1 \\text{ gamete}) \\times p(A_1 \\text{ gamete}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n    - $p(A_{1}A_{2}) = 2 \\times p(A_1) \\times p(A_2) = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n    - $p(A_{2}A_{2}) = p(A_2) \\times p(A_2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n    The required frequency for the first part of the incompatible genotype is $p(A_{1}A_{1}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n2.  **Frequency of the $B_{2}B_{2}$ genotype at locus $L_{B}$**:\n    Similarly, for locus $L_B$, the random mating of $F_1$ individuals is equivalent to a series of $B_{1}B_{2} \\times B_{1}B_{2}$ crosses. The allele frequencies for $B_1$ and $B_2$ in the $F_1$ gamete pool are both $\\frac{1}{2}$. The expected genotype frequencies are:\n    - $p(B_{1}B_{1}) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n    - $p(B_{1}B_{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n    - $p(B_{2}B_{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n    The required frequency for the second part of the incompatible genotype is $p(B_{2}B_{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n**Combined Genotype Frequency:**\nSince the loci $L_A$ and $L_B$ are unlinked and assort independently, the probability of an $F_2$ individual inheriting a specific genotype at both loci is the product of the probabilities of inheriting each genotype separately. We seek the frequency of individuals with the genotype $A_{1}A_{1}B_{2}B_{2}$.\n$$p(A_{1}A_{1}B_{2}B_{2}) = p(A_{1}A_{1}) \\times p(B_{2}B_{2})$$\nSubstituting the calculated frequencies:\n$$p(A_{1}A_{1}B_{2}B_{2}) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$$\nThis is the expected fraction of $F_2$ zygotes that carry the incompatible genotype combination. This calculation is performed for the zygotic stage, before the effects of selection (complete hybrid breakdown) manifest.\n\nThus, the exact expected fraction of $F_{2}$ individuals that carry the incompatible genotype combination $A_{1}A_{1}B_{2}B_{2}$ is $\\frac{1}{16}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}$$", "id": "2724960"}, {"introduction": "Building on the frequency of incompatible genotypes, we now turn to their evolutionary consequences.
