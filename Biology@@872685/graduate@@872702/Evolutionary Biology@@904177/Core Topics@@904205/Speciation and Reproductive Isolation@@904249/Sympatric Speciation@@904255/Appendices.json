This trait is controlled by a single genetic locus with two co-dominant alleles, $A_1$ and $A_2$. The genotype $A_1A_1$ results in a \"benthic\" morph, highly adapted for scraping algae from rocks. The genotype $A_2A_2$ results in a \"limnetic\" morph, adapted for catching zooplankton in the open water column. The heterozygous genotype $A_1A_2$ produces an \"intermediate\" morph that is less efficient at both feeding strategies.\n\nDue to this difference in foraging efficiency, the morphs have different survival rates from the zygote stage to reproductive adulthood. The survival probabilities are:\n- Benthic ($A_1A_1$): $S_1 = 0.90$\n- Limnetic ($A_2A_2$): $S_2 = 0.90$\n- Intermediate ($A_1A_2$): $S_{12} = 0.75$\n\nAt the beginning of a generation, the population of newly formed zygotes is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, with the frequency of the $A_1$ allele being $p_0 = 0.40$.

This next problem [@problem_id:2754526] explores that crucial next step: the evolution of assortative mating. You will derive the invasion condition for a \"preference\" allele in a classic two-locus model, revealing the fundamental conditions under which reproductive isolation can evolve as an adaptive response to the selective pressures you explored previously.", "problem": "Consider a large, randomly mating, diploid population with discrete generations and two diallelic loci: an ecological locus $E \\in \\{E_{1},E_{2}\\}$ and a preference locus $P \\in \\{P,p\\}$. The life cycle is viability selection followed by mating and reproduction. Viability selection acts only on the ecological locus with symmetric disruptive selection: genotypes $E_{1}E_{1}$ and $E_{2}E_{2}$ have fitness $1$, whereas the heterozygote $E_{1}E_{2}$ has fitness $1 - s$ with $s \\in (0,1)$. The preference locus has no direct viability or fecundity effects. The resident population is fixed for the non-preference allele $p$ and mates randomly. A rare mutant preference allele $P$ arises. Carriers of $P$ (in either sex) mate assortatively by ecological genotype with strength $a \\in [0,1]$ as follows: conditional on the ecological genotype of the $P$-carrier parent, with probability $a$ the parent mates with an adult whose ecological genotype is identical to its own; with probability $1 - a$ the parent mates at random from the adult population. Residents $p$ always mate at random.\n\nAssume that at the time $P$ is rare, the ecological locus is polymorphic among adults after viability selection, with genotype frequencies $f_{11}$, $f_{12}$, and $f_{22}$ for $E_{1}E_{1}$, $E_{1}E_{2}$, and $E_{2}E_{2}$, respectively, satisfying $f_{11} > 0$, $f_{22} > 0$, $f_{12} \\ge 0$, and $f_{11} + f_{12} + f_{22} = 1$. Let the corresponding adult allele frequencies at $E$ be $p = f_{11} + \\tfrac{1}{2} f_{12}$ and $q = 1 - p = f_{22} + \\tfrac{1}{2} f_{12}$. Assume free recombination between $E$ and $P$ or that the rare $P$ allele is initially at linkage equilibrium with $E$; the initial distribution of $P$ across $E$ genotypes is then proportional to $f_{11}, f_{12}, f_{22}$.\n\nUsing only standard population genetic principles (Hardy–Weinberg expectations before selection, viability selection on $E$, random mating in the resident population, and the definition of invasion as an increase in frequency from rarity when the marginal fitness of $P$ exceeds that of the resident), derive the minimal assortative mating strength $a_{\\min}(s)$ required for the rare allele $P$ to invade. You may assume there are no direct costs to choosiness or mate search and that mate availability is not limiting. Express your final answer for $a_{\\min}(s)$ as a single closed-form analytic expression. No numerical rounding is required.", "solution": "The condition for the rare preference allele $P$ to invade is that its marginal fitness, $W_P$, is greater than the marginal fitness of the resident allele $p$, which is $W_p=1$. We must therefore find the condition for which $W_P > 1$.\n\n**1. Resident Population Equilibrium**\nFirst, we find the polymorphic equilibrium of the resident population, where all individuals mate randomly. Let the frequencies of alleles $E_1$ and $E_2$ in the zygote pool be $p_z$ and $q_z = 1-p_z$. After viability selection, the mean fitness is $\\bar{W} = p_z^2(1) + 2p_zq_z(1-s) + q_z^2(1) = 1 - 2sp_zq_z$. The frequency of $E_1$ in the next generation is $p_z' = \\frac{p_z(1-sq_z)}{1-2sp_zq_z}$. The polymorphic equilibrium occurs when $p_z' = p_z$, which solves to $p_z=1/2$. At this equilibrium, the mean fitness is $\\bar{W} = 1 - s/2$. The adult genotype frequencies after selection are:\n- $f_{11} = \\frac{(1/2)^2}{\\bar{W}} = \\frac{1}{2(2-s)}$\n- $f_{12} = \\frac{2(1/2)(1/2)(1-s)}{\\bar{W}} = \\frac{1-s}{2-s}$\n- $f_{22} = f_{11} = \\frac{1}{2(2-s)}$\nThe adult allele frequencies remain $p=q=1/2$.\n\n**2. Marginal Fitness of the Mutant Allele P**\nThe marginal fitness of $P$ is the average number of successful offspring produced by a $P$-carrying adult, normalized by the resident population's mean fitness. Since the rare $P$ allele is at linkage equilibrium with the $E$ locus, its distribution across adult ecological genotypes $E_{ij}$ is proportional to their frequencies $f_{ij}$. The absolute average survival of offspring from a $P$-gamete, $S_P$, is an average over these genetic backgrounds: $S_P = f_{11}S_{P|11} + f_{12}S_{P|12} + f_{22}S_{P|22}$, where $S_{P|ij}$ is the average survival of offspring produced by a $PpE_{ij}$ parent. By symmetry ($f_{11}=f_{22}$ and $S_{P|11}=S_{P|22}$), this becomes $S_P = 2f_{11}S_{P|11} + f_{12}S_{P|12}$.\n\n**3. Calculating Offspring Survival for P-carriers**\n- **For a $P$-carrier of genotype $E_{1}E_{1}$:** This parent produces $PE_1$ gametes.\n    - With probability $a$, it mates assortatively with another $E_1E_1$ adult. The resulting zygote is $PpE_1E_1$ with survival $1$.\n    - With probability $1-a$, it mates randomly. The mate's gamete is $E_1$ with probability $1/2$ or $E_2$ with probability $1/2$. The average offspring survival is $\\frac{1}{2}(1) + \\frac{1}{2}(1-s) = 1-s/2$.\n    - The total average survival is $S_{P|11} = a(1) + (1-a)(1 - s/2) = 1 - s/2 + as/2$.\n- **For a $P$-carrier of genotype $E_{1}E_{2}$:** Due to free recombination, this parent produces $PE_1$ and $PE_2$ gametes in equal proportion.\n    - With probability $a$, it mates assortatively with another $E_1E_2$ adult. The average offspring survival is $1-s/2$.\n    - With probability $1-a$, it mates randomly. The average offspring survival is also $1-s/2$.\n    - Therefore, $S_{P|12} = 1-s/2$.\n\n**4. Deriving the Invasion Condition**\nSubstituting these into the expression for $S_P$:\n$$ S_P = 2f_{11}\\left(1 - \\frac{s}{2} + a\\frac{s}{2}\\right) + f_{12}\\left(1-\\frac{s}{2}\\right) = (2f_{11} + f_{12})\\left(1-\\frac{s}{2}\\right) + a s f_{11} $$\nSince the adult frequencies sum to one ($2f_{11} + f_{12} = 1$), this simplifies to $S_P = 1 - s/2 + a s f_{11}$.\nThe marginal fitness of $P$ is $W_P = S_P / \\bar{W}$:\n$$ W_P = \\frac{1 - s/2 + a s f_{11}}{1 - s/2} = 1 + \\frac{a s f_{11}}{1 - s/2} $$\nSubstituting $f_{11} = \\frac{1}{2(2-s)}$ and $1-s/2 = \\frac{2-s}{2}$:\n$$ W_P = 1 + \\frac{a s \\left(\\frac{1}{2(2-s)}\\right)}{\\frac{2-s}{2}} = 1 + \\frac{as}{(2-s)^2} $$\nThe invasion condition is $W_P > 1$, which implies $\\frac{as}{(2-s)^2} > 0$. Since $s \\in (0,1)$, both $s$ and $(2-s)^2$ are positive. Therefore, the condition for invasion is $a > 0$.\nThe minimal assortative mating strength required for invasion is any value greater than zero.

This final practice [@problem_id:2754559] shifts your focus from theoretical derivation to experimental design, confronting the critical issue of distinguishing true sympatric divergence from fine-scale spatial segregation, or micro-allopatry. By evaluating different sampling strategies, you will engage with the practical difficulties and rigorous standards required to validate models of speciation in iconic natural systems like the three-spined stickleback.", "problem": "In postglacial lakes, benthic–limnetic three-spined sticklebacks are often used as a model for studying ecological divergence. A persistent inferential challenge is distinguishing micro-allopatric divergence along a depth gradient (individuals effectively isolated by consistent spatial segregation across depth, possibly with temporal segregation during breeding) from true sympatric divergence (individuals of diverging ecotypes occurring in fine-scale syntopy at the same depths and times but maintaining reproductive isolation via assortative mating or strong disruptive selection). Assume the following foundational facts and definitions: gene flow reduces genome-wide divergence, isolation by distance causes genetic distance to increase with geographic separation, isolation by environment predicts genetic distance increases with environmental dissimilarity even when geographic distance is controlled, and the Wahlund effect inflates apparent heterozygote deficits when samples pool reproductively isolated groups. Assume you can collect genomes at thousands of loci, phenotype trophic morphology, assay diet via stable isotopes, and locate nests during the breeding season.\n\nWhich within-lake sampling design would most powerfully and cleanly discriminate micro-allopatric divergence along depth from true sympatric divergence, while minimizing confounding by spatial structure and time?\n\nA. Establish $r = 3$ to $r = 5$ replicate perpendicular transects from shore to pelagic across the lake. Along each transect, collect adults and active nests in $k = 4$ to $k = 6$ narrowly spaced depth strata (e.g., stratum thickness $\\leq 1~\\mathrm{m}$), with $n \\geq 30$ genotyped adults per stratum per transect, and $n \\geq 20$ nests per stratum. Sample on $t = 3$ evenly spaced dates spanning the breeding season. In each transect and date, perform paired syntopic collections at the same depth and time wherever both ecomorphs co-occur (identified by morphology and diet). For each adult pair $i,j$, quantify pairwise genetic distance and annotate (i) horizontal distance along transect, (ii) absolute depth difference, and (iii) ecotype labels based on morphology and isotopes. Conduct paternity assignments for nests to identify mating pairs within and across ecotypes at each depth and time. Repeat the transects in a second lake as a replicate. Use these data to test whether residual genome-wide divergence and assortative mating persist in syntopy after accounting for depth and horizontal distance.\n\nB. At the single deepest basin of the lake, collect one limnetic sample from the metalimnion ($n = 50$) and one benthic sample from the littoral ($n = 50$) on a single day.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no logical or factual flaws. The core challenge is to empirically distinguish true sympatric divergence from micro-allopatric divergence. True sympatry requires demonstrating that reproductive isolation is maintained between ecotypes even when they co-occur in the same place at the same time (syntopy). Micro-allopatry posits that the ecotypes are simply segregated by space (e.g., depth) or time, and this separation is the primary barrier to gene flow. A successful experimental design must therefore simultaneously quantify spatial distributions, temporal distributions, reproductive behavior, and genetic divergence at a fine scale.\n\nLet us evaluate each option.\n\nA. This option proposes a hierarchical and comprehensive sampling design.\n- **Spatial Structure**: The use of $r = 3$ to $r = 5$ replicate transects provides statistical power and controls for idiosyncrasies of any single location within the lake. Sampling along $k = 4$ to $k = 6$ narrow depth strata on each transect directly maps the genetic and ecological variation onto the key environmental gradient (depth). Recording horizontal distance allows for statistical correction of isolation by distance (IBD).\n- **Temporal Structure**: Sampling on $t = 3$ distinct dates across the breeding season directly tests for temporal segregation of reproductive activity, a key component of the micro-allopatry hypothesis.\n- **Syntopy Test**: Critically, the design includes \"paired syntopic collections at the same depth and time\". This isolates the exact scenario where the two hypotheses make different predictions. In these syntopic samples, the micro-allopatry hypothesis predicts random mating, whereas the true sympatry hypothesis predicts assortative mating.\n- **Reproductive Isolation**: The design employs the most direct and powerful method to assess reproductive isolation in the wild: \"paternity assignments for nests to identify mating pairs\". This measures *realized* mating patterns, not just mate choice potential.\n- **Genetic and Phenotypic Data**: Collection of genome-wide data, morphology, and stable isotopes allows for robust classification of individuals into ecomorphs (benthic, limnetic, hybrid) and for quantifying divergence.\n- **Analytical Approach**: The proposed analysis—\"test whether residual genome-wide divergence and assortative mating persist in syntopy after accounting for depth and horizontal distance\"—is precisely the correct statistical procedure. It seeks to partition the variance in divergence and mating patterns into components due to spatial separation versus those intrinsic to the ecotypes when space is controlled for.\n- **Replication**: The suggestion to repeat the study in a second lake adds another level of replication, strengthening the generality of any conclusions.\n\nThis design is rigorous, multifaceted, and directly tailored to disentangle the confounding effects of fine-scale spatial and temporal structure from true reproductive isolation in syntopy.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. This option suggests collecting two bulk samples, one limnetic and one benthic, on a single day and calculating the fixation index, $F_{\\mathrm{ST}}$. This design is fundamentally flawed. The two samples are, by definition, collected from different habitats (littoral vs. metalimnion) and are thus spatially segregated. A significant $F_{\\mathrm{ST}}$ value would indicate genetic differentiation between these two locations, which is an expected outcome under *both* micro-allopatry and sympatry. It provides no information to distinguish whether the differentiation is caused by the spatial separation itself (micro-allopatry) or by reproductive barriers that operate even in the absence of spatial separation (sympatry). The conclusion that a high $F_{\\mathrm{ST}}$ in the \"same lake\" implies sympatry is a logical error, as it ignores the critical role of fine-scale spatial structure within the lake.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. This option proposes comparing within-lake $F_{\\mathrm{ST}}$ to among-lake $F_{\\mathrm{ST}}$ across $10$ lakes. The premise that sympatric divergence is supported if within-lake $F_{\\mathrm{ST}}$ exceeds among-lake $F_{\\mathrm{ST}}$ is biologically nonsensical. Divergence between populations in separate lakes, which have been isolated for thousands of years, will almost certainly be far greater than divergence between ecotypes within a single lake. Furthermore, like option B, this design uses pooled samples for each ecotype within a lake, thereby completely averaging over and ignoring the crucial fine-scale spatial information. It cannot test for reproductive isolation in syntopy.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. This option proposes laboratory mate-choice trials with fish collected from shallow ($\\leq 2~\\mathrm{m}$) and deep ($\\geq 6~\\mathrm{m}$) habitats. While demonstrating assortative mating in a lab setting is evidence for a pre-zygotic reproductive barrier, it is insufficient to distinguish the hypotheses. The artificial lab environment may not reflect natural behavior. More importantly, even if strong assortative mating potential exists, this does not prove that the populations are sympatric in the wild. They could still be perfectly allopatric (spatially segregated by depth), in which case this behavioral barrier is never actually tested in nature. To support true sympatry, one must demonstrate both co-occurrence *and* reproductive isolation in the natural habitat. This design only addresses a potential for isolation and provides no information about co-occurrence.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. This option suggests using passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags to track fish movement. This method directly addresses the question of spatial overlap and habitat fidelity. It can determine whether the ecotypes have the opportunity to interact. However, it provides no genetic or reproductive data. If the fish demonstrate significant spatial overlap (inferred as \"sympatry\" by the option's logic), this design cannot determine whether they are interbreeding freely or are maintaining reproductive isolation through assortative mating. It measures the opportunity for gene flow but not the gene flow itself or the barriers to it. Therefore, it cannot, on its own, distinguish a single panmictic population with resource polymorphism from a system of two sympatric, reproductively isolated species.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, Option A is the only one that proposes a design capable of rigorously and cleanly discriminating between micro-allopatric and true sympatric divergence. It integrates fine-grained spatial and temporal sampling with direct observation of reproductive behavior and its genetic consequences, allowing for a statistical test that directly addresses the core question.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2754559"}]}
