It is therefore deemed valid. We shall proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe system described involves a single locus with two alleles, $A$ and $a$. The population is assumed to be large, diploid, and to mate randomly. We begin from the state before selection within a single generation, where the genotype proportions conform to the Hardy–Weinberg principle. Let $p$ be the frequency of allele $A$ and $q = 1-p$ be the frequency of allele $a$.\n\nThe pre-selection frequencies of the genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ are given as $p^{2}$, $2pq$, and $q^{2}$, respectively.\n\nViability selection acts upon these genotypes. The relative viabilities (fitnesses) are given as $w_{AA}=1$, $w_{Aa}=1-s$, and $w_{aa}=1-r$. For underdominance to hold, the heterozygote fitness must be lower than both homozygote fitnesses. The condition $s>0$ ensures $w_{Aa}  w_{AA}$. The second condition, $w_{Aa}  w_{aa}$, requires $1-s  1-r$, which simplifies to $s>r$. The numerical values used in the problem, $s=0.2$ and $r=0.1$, satisfy these requirements.\n\nAfter selection, the frequency of each genotype is proportional to its initial frequency multiplied by its relative fitness.\n- Proportional frequency of $AA$: $p^{2} w_{AA} = p^{2}(1) = p^{2}$\n- Proportional frequency of $Aa$: $2pq w_{Aa} = 2pq(1-s)$\n- Proportional frequency of $aa$: $q^{2} w_{aa} = q^{2}(1-r)$\n\nTo obtain the true genotype frequencies after selection, we must normalize these quantities by their sum. This sum is the mean fitness of the population, denoted by $\\bar{w}$.\n$$ \\bar{w} = p^{2} w_{AA} + 2pq w_{Aa} + q^{2} w_{aa} $$\n$$ \\bar{w} = p^{2} + 2pq(1-s) + q^{2}(1-r) $$\n\nThe frequency of allele $A$ after selection, denoted $p'$, is the sum of the frequency of the $AA$ genotype plus half the frequency of the $Aa$ genotype in the post-selection population. The number of $A$ alleles is proportional to $2(p^{2} w_{AA}) + 1(2pq w_{Aa})$, and the total number of alleles is proportional to $2\\bar{w}$. Thus, the frequency $p'$ is:\n$$ p' = \\frac{p^{2} w_{AA} + pq w_{Aa}}{\\bar{w}} $$\nSubstituting the given fitness values, we derive the explicit expression for $p'$ as a function of $p$, $s$, and $r$:\n$$ p' = \\frac{p^{2}(1) + p(1-p)(1-s)}{p^{2}(1) + 2p(1-p)(1-s) + (1-p)^{2}(1-r)} $$\nThis is the general formula for the allele frequency in the next generation under this selection regime.\n\nNow, we must compute the numerical value of $p'$ for the given parameters: $p=0.4$, $s=0.2$, and $r=0.1$.

For a sample of diploid individuals, the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) of an allele's frequency is its observed proportion in the sample.\nThe total number of zygotes is $N^{(0)} = n_{AA}^{(0)} + n_{Aa}^{(0)} + n_{aa}^{(0)} = 500 + 1000 + 500 = 2000$.\nThe number of $A$ alleles in the zygote sample is $2n_{AA}^{(0)} + n_{Aa}^{(0)}$. The total number of alleles is $2N^{(0)}$.\nThe MLE of $p$ is:\n$$\n\\hat{p} = \\frac{2n_{AA}^{(0)} + n_{Aa}^{(0)}}{2(n_{AA}^{(0)} + n_{Aa}^{(0)} + n_{aa}^{(0)})} = \\frac{2(500) + 1000}{2(2000)} = \\frac{2000}{4000} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nWith $\\hat{p} = 1/2$, the expected Hardy-Weinberg genotype frequencies are $\\hat{p}^{2} = 1/4$, $2\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p}) = 1/2$, and $(1-\\hat{p})^{2} = 1/4$. The observed frequencies in the zygote sample are $n_{AA}^{(0)}/N^{(0)} = 500/2000 = 1/4$, $n_{Aa}^{(0)}/N^{(0)} = 1000/2000 = 1/2$, and $n_{aa}^{(0)}/N^{(0)} = 500/2000 = 1/4$. The data conform perfectly to Hardy-Weinberg proportions for $\\hat{p} = 1/2$.\n\nNext, we derive the MLEs for the absolute survival probabilities, $s_g$. For each genotype $g$, we observe that $n_g^{(1)}$ individuals survive out of an initial $n_g^{(0)}$. This is a binomial process. The likelihood of observing the adult counts given the zygote counts and the survival probabilities $\\{s_{AA}, s_{Aa}, s_{aa}\\}$ is the product of the likelihoods for each genotype, as they are independent:\n$$\nL(s_{AA}, s_{Aa}, s_{aa}) = \\prod_{g \\in \\{AA, Aa, aa\\}} \\binom{n_g^{(0)}}{n_g^{(1)}} s_g^{n_g^{(1)}} (1-s_g)^{n_g^{(0)}-n_g^{(1)}}\n$$\nTo maximize this, we work with the log-likelihood, $\\ell = \\ln(L)$:\n$$\n\\ell = \\sum_{g} \\left[ \\ln\\binom{n_g^{(0)}}{n_g^{(1)}} + n_g^{(1)}\\ln(s_g) + (n_g^{(0)}-n_g^{(1)})\\ln(1-s_g) \\right]\n$$\nThe parameters $s_g$ are independent in this function. We find the MLE $\\hat{s}_g$ by taking the partial derivative with respect to $s_g$ and setting it to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\ell}{\\partial s_g} = \\frac{n_g^{(1)}}{s_g} - \\frac{n_g^{(0)}-n_g^{(1)}}{1-s_g} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $s_g$ yields the MLE:\n$$\n\\hat{s}_g = \\frac{n_g^{(1)}}{n_g^{(0)}}\n$$\nThis is the observed proportion of survivors for each genotype.\n\nUsing the given data, we calculate these MLEs:\n$$\n\\hat{s}_{AA} = \\frac{n_{AA}^{(1)}}{n_{AA}^{(0)}} = \\frac{175}{500} = \\frac{7}{20}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{s}_{Aa} = \\frac{n_{Aa}^{(1)}}{n_{Aa}^{(0)}} = \\frac{100}{1000} = \\frac{1}{10}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{s}_{aa} = \\frac{n_{aa}^{(1)}}{n_{aa}^{(0)}} = \\frac{125}{500} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n\nFinally, we derive the MLEs for the relative viabilities, $w_g$. We are given the relation $s_g = c \\, w_g$ and the constraint $p^{2} w_{AA} + 2p(1-p) w_{Aa} + (1-p)^{2} w_{aa} = 1$. The expression on the left is the mean relative viability, let us call it $\\bar{w}$. The constraint is $\\bar{w}=1$.\nBy the invariance property of MLEs, we have $\\hat{s}_g = \\hat{c} \\, \\hat{w}_g$. This implies that the relative viability estimators are proportional to the absolute survival estimators, i.e., $\\hat{w}_g \\propto \\hat{s}_g$.\nThe constraint, applied to our estimators, becomes:\n$$\n\\hat{p}^{2} \\hat{w}_{AA} + 2\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p}) \\hat{w}_{Aa} + (1-\\hat{p})^{2} \\hat{w}_{aa} = 1\n$$\nSubstituting $\\hat{w}_g = k\\,\\hat{s}_g$ for some normalization constant $k$:\n$$\nk \\left( \\hat{p}^{2} \\hat{s}_{AA} + 2\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p}) \\hat{s}_{Aa} + (1-\\hat{p})^{2} \\hat{s}_{aa} \\right) = 1\n$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is the estimated mean absolute survival, $\\hat{\\bar{s}}$, weighted by the estimated zygote genotype frequencies.\n$$\n\\hat{\\bar{s}} = \\hat{p}^{2} \\hat{s}_{AA} + 2\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p}) \\hat{s}_{Aa} + (1-\\hat{p})^{2} \\hat{s}_{aa}\n$$\nTherefore, $k = 1/\\hat{\\bar{s}}$, and the MLE for each relative viability is:\n$$\n\\hat{w}_g = \\frac{\\hat{s}_g}{\\hat{\\bar{s}}}\n$$\nWe can calculate $\\hat{\\bar{s}}$ directly. Since the observed zygote genotype frequencies $f_g^{(0)} = n_g^{(0)}/N^{(0)}$ match the HWE frequencies calculated from $\\hat{p}$, we can write:\n$$\n\\hat{\\bar{s}} = \\sum_g f_g^{(0)} \\hat{s}_g = \\sum_g \\frac{n_g^{(0)}}{N^{(0)}} \\frac{n_g^{(1)}}{n_g^{(0)}} = \\sum_g \\frac{n_g^{(1)}}{N^{(0)}} = \\frac{N^{(1)}}{N^{(0)}}\n$$\nwhere $N^{(1)} = n_{AA}^{(1)} + n_{Aa}^{(1)} + n_{aa}^{(1)}$ is the total number of adults.\nWe calculate $N^{(1)}$ from the data:\n$$\nN^{(1)} = 175 + 100 + 125 = 400\n$$\nNow we can compute the estimated mean absolute survival:\n$$\n\\hat{\\bar{s}} = \\frac{N^{(1)}}{N^{(0)}} = \\frac{400}{2000} = \\frac{1}{5}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the MLEs for the relative viabilities:\n$$\n\\hat{w}_{AA} = \\frac{\\hat{s}_{AA}}{\\hat{\\bar{s}}} = \\frac{7/20}{1/5} = \\frac{7}{20} \\times 5 = \\frac{7}{4}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{w}_{Aa} = \\frac{\\hat{s}_{Aa}}{\\hat{\\bar{s}}} = \\frac{1/10}{1/5} = \\frac{1}{10} \\times 5 = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{w}_{aa} = \\frac{\\hat{s}_{aa}}{\\hat{\\bar{s}}} = \\frac{1/4}{1/5} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 5 = \\frac{5}{4}\n$$\nThe estimated relative viabilities are $(\\hat{w}_{AA}, \\hat{w}_{Aa}, \\hat{w}_{aa}) = (7/4, 1/2, 5/4)$. This is a case of underdominance, or heterozygote disadvantage, as the viability of the heterozygote is lower than that of both homozygotes.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{7}{4}  \\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{5}{4}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2761005"}]}
