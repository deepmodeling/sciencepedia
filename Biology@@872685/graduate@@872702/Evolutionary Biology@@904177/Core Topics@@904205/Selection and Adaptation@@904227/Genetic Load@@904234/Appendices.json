The tasks are unambiguous.\n- It is **Objective**: The language is formal and quantitative, free of any subjectivity or non-scientific claims.\n- The problem is self-contained, consistent, and logically structured.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles, as required.\n\nTask 1: Derivation of Equilibrium Mean Relative Fitness\nLet $p_{k}(t)$ be the frequency of individuals carrying $k$ deleterious mutations in generation $t$. The mean absolute fitness of the population at generation $t$ is $\\bar{W}(t) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} p_{k}(t) W_{k}$.\nThe process from one generation to the next involves selection followed by mutation.\n\nFirst, consider the effect of selection within generation $t$. The frequency of individuals with $k$ mutations after selection, $p'_{k}(t)$, is proportional to their frequency before selection multiplied by their fitness:\n$$p'_{k}(t) = \\frac{p_{k}(t) W_{k}}{\\bar{W}(t)}$$\nNext, consider the effect of mutation. New mutations arise according to a Poisson distribution with mean $U$. The probability that an individual acquires exactly $j$ new mutations is $P(j) = \\frac{U^{j} \\exp(-U)}{j!}$. We assume no back mutations, so an individual with $i$ mutations can only transition to a state with $k \\geq i$ mutations.\n\nTo find the equilibrium state, it is sufficient to analyze the dynamics of the mutation-free class ($k=0$). The frequency of the mutation-free class in generation $t+1$, denoted $p_{0}(t+1)$, is determined by the frequency of the mutation-free class after selection in generation $t$, $p'_{0}(t)$, multiplied by the probability that their offspring acquire zero new mutations.\nThe frequency of the mutation-free class after selection is:\n$$p'_{0}(t) = \\frac{p_{0}(t) W_{0}}{\\bar{W}(t)}$$\nThe probability of acquiring zero new mutations is given by the Poisson distribution with $j=0$:\n$$P(0) = \\frac{U^{0} \\exp(-U)}{0!} = \\exp(-U)$$\nSince there is no back mutation, no individuals from classes $k > 0$ can contribute to the $k=0$ class. Therefore, the frequency of the mutation-free class in the next generation is:\n$$p_{0}(t+1) = p'_{0}(t) \\times P(0) = \\frac{p_{0}(t) W_{0}}{\\bar{W}(t)} \\exp(-U)$$\nAt equilibrium, the frequency of each class is constant, so $p_{0}(t+1) = p_{0}(t) = p_{0}$. The equation becomes:\n$$p_{0} = \\frac{p_{0} W_{0}}{\\bar{W}} \\exp(-U)$$\nwhere $\\bar{W}$ is the equilibrium mean absolute fitness. Assuming a non-trivial equilibrium exists where the mutation-free class is not lost (i.e., $p_{0} > 0$), we can divide both sides by $p_{0}$:\n$$1 = \\frac{W_{0}}{\\bar{W}} \\exp(-U)$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$\\frac{\\bar{W}}{W_{0}} = \\exp(-U)$$\nBy definition, the mean relative fitness is $\\bar{w} = \\bar{W} / W_{0}$. Thus, at equilibrium, the mean relative fitness is:\n$$\\bar{w} = \\exp(-U)$$\nThis result, known as the Haldane-Muller principle for this model, demonstrates that the equilibrium mean relative fitness depends only on the genomic deleterious mutation rate $U$ and is notably independent of the selection coefficient $s$ for each mutation, given the assumption of multiplicative fitness.\n\nTask 2: Calculation of Mutation Load\nThe mutation load $L$ is defined as $L = 1 - \\bar{w}$. Substituting the result from Task 1:\n$$L = 1 - \\exp(-U)$$\nThe problem provides a genomic deleterious mutation rate of $U = 1.2$. We compute the numerical value for $L$:\n$$L = 1 - \\exp(-1.2)$$\n$$L \\approx 1 - 0.3011942119...$$\n$$L \\approx 0.698805788...$$\nRounding the result to $4$ significant figures, we get:\n$$L \\approx 0.6988$$\n\nTask 3: Interpretation and Demographic Consequences\nA mutation load of $L \\approx 0.6988$ signifies that the mean fitness of the population is reduced to approximately $1 - 0.6988 = 0.3012$, or $30.12\\%$, of the fitness of the theoretical mutation-free genotype. This substantial fitness reduction is the \"load\" the population bears to purge the continuous influx of deleterious mutations.\n\nFor the population size to be stationary, the mean absolute fitness of the population, $\\bar{W}$, must equal $1$. The fitness of the mutation-free genotype, $W_0$, is given as $R_0$ in this context.\nThe condition for stationarity is:\n$$\\bar{W} = 1$$\nUsing the definition $\\bar{w} = \\bar{W}/W_{0}$ (or $\\bar{w} = \\bar{W}/R_0$ here):\n$$\\bar{W} = R_{0} \\bar{w} = 1$$\nFrom this, we can express $R_{0}$:\n$$R_{0} = \\frac{1}{\\bar{w}}$$\nThe per-capita reproductive excess required is $R_{0} - 1$. Substituting the expression for $R_0$:\n$$R_{0} - 1 = \\frac{1}{\\bar{w}} - 1$$\nTo express this as a function of the genetic load $L$, we use the definition $L = 1 - \\bar{w}$, which implies $\\bar{w} = 1 - L$. Substituting this into the equation for the reproductive excess:\n$$R_{0} - 1 = \\frac{1}{1-L} - 1$$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator:\n$$R_{0} - 1 = \\frac{1 - (1-L)}{1-L} = \\frac{1 - 1 + L}{1-L}$$\nThe final symbolic relationship is:\n$$R_{0} - 1 = \\frac{L}{1-L}$$\nThis equation shows that the reproductive excess required of the fittest individuals to offset the mutation load increases non-linearly with the load itself.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6988}$$", "id": "2717733"}, {"introduction": "While mutation load represents the cost of eliminating harmful alleles, another important form of load arises from maintaining beneficial genetic diversity.

It does not contain contradictory or incomplete information.\n\n**Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nLet $p$ be the frequency of allele $A$ and $q$ be the frequency of allele $a$, such that $p+q=1$. Under the assumption of random mating, the frequencies of genotypes in the zygote stage are given by the Hardy–Weinberg proportions: $p^2$ for $AA$, $2pq$ for $Aa$, and $q^2$ for $aa$.\n\nViability selection occurs before reproduction. The mean viability of the population, $\\overline{W}$, is the weighted average of the genotype viabilities:\n$$ \\overline{W} = p^2 w_{AA} + 2pq w_{Aa} + q^2 w_{aa} = p^2(1-s) + 2pq(1) + q^2(1-t) $$\nThe frequencies of the genotypes among the surviving adults are proportional to $p^2(1-s)$, $2pq$, and $q^2(1-t)$. The frequency of allele $A$ in the next generation, $p'$, is the frequency of $A$ alleles in this selected group of adults:\n$$ p' = \\frac{p^2 w_{AA} + pq w_{Aa}}{\\overline{W}} = \\frac{p(p w_{AA} + q w_{Aa})}{\\overline{W}} $$\nWe define the marginal fitness of allele $A$ as $W_A = p w_{AA} + q w_{Aa}$ and of allele $a$ as $W_a = p w_{Aa} + q w_{aa}$. The mean fitness can then be written as $\\overline{W} = p W_A + q W_a$. The expression for $p'$ becomes $p' = pW_A / \\overline{W}$.\n\nThe change in allele frequency in one generation is $\\Delta p = p' - p$:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{p W_A}{\\overline{W}} - p = \\frac{pW_A - p\\overline{W}}{\\overline{W}} = \\frac{p(W_A - \\overline{W})}{\\overline{W}} $$\nSubstituting $\\overline{W} = pW_A + qW_a = pW_A + (1-p)W_a$:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{p(W_A - (pW_A + qW_a))}{\\overline{W}} = \\frac{p(W_A(1-p) - qW_a)}{\\overline{W}} = \\frac{p(qW_A - qW_a)}{\\overline{W}} = \\frac{pq(W_A - W_a)}{\\overline{W}} $$\nThis is the general equation for allele frequency change under viability selection.\n\n**Part 1: Equilibrium Frequencies and Mean Viability**\n\nA polymorphic equilibrium exists when $\\Delta p = 0$ for $p \\in (0, 1)$ and $q \\in (0, 1)$. This requires the term $(W_A - W_a)$ to be zero. Thus, at equilibrium, the marginal fitnesses of the alleles must be equal: $W_A = W_a$.\n\nLet $\\hat{p}$ and $\\hat{q}$ be the equilibrium frequencies. We calculate the marginal fitnesses using the given viabilities:\n$$ W_A = p(1-s) + q(1) = p - sp + q = (p+q) - sp = 1 - sp $$\n$$ W_a = p(1) + q(1-t) = p + q - tq = (p+q) - tq = 1 - tq $$\nSetting $W_A = W_a$ at equilibrium:\n$$ 1 - s\\hat{p} = 1 - t\\hat{q} $$\n$$ s\\hat{p} = t\\hat{q} $$\nUsing the identity $\\hat{q} = 1 - \\hat{p}$:\n$$ s\\hat{p} = t(1 - \\hat{p}) = t - t\\hat{p} $$\n$$ \\hat{p}(s+t) = t $$\n$$ \\hat{p} = \\frac{t}{s+t} $$\nThe equilibrium frequency of allele $a$ is:\n$$ \\hat{q} = 1 - \\hat{p} = 1 - \\frac{t}{s+t} = \\frac{s}{s+t} $$\nNext, we compute the mean viability at this equilibrium, $\\overline{W}^{\\ast}$. At equilibrium, $\\overline{W}^{\\ast} = \\hat{p} W_A(\\hat{p}) + \\hat{q} W_a(\\hat{p})$. Since $W_A(\\hat{p}) = W_a(\\hat{p})$, this simplifies to $\\overline{W}^{\\ast} = (\\hat{p}+\\hat{q})W_A(\\hat{p}) = W_A(\\hat{p})$.\n$$ \\overline{W}^{\\ast} = 1 - s\\hat{p} = 1 - s\\left(\\frac{t}{s+t}\\right) = \\frac{s+t-st}{s+t} $$\nAlternatively, we can express $\\overline{W}$ as $\\overline{W} = 1 - sp^2 - tq^2$. At equilibrium:\n$$ \\overline{W}^{\\ast} = 1 - s\\hat{p}^2 - t\\hat{q}^2 = 1 - s\\left(\\frac{t}{s+t}\\right)^2 - t\\left(\\frac{s}{s+t}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{st^2 + ts^2}{(s+t)^2} = 1 - \\frac{st(t+s)}{(s+t)^2} = 1 - \\frac{st}{s+t} $$\nThis confirms our result for $\\overline{W}^{\\ast}$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Segregation Load**\n\nThe genetic load is defined as $L=(W_{\\max}-\\overline{W})/W_{\\max}$. For this overdominant system, the genotype with the highest viability is the heterozygote $Aa$, so $W_{\\max} = w_{Aa} = 1$. The load formula simplifies to $L = 1 - \\overline{W}$.\n\nThe segregation load, $L_{\\text{seg}}$, is the load present at the polymorphic equilibrium maintained by selection. It is calculated using the equilibrium mean fitness $\\overline{W}^{\\ast}$:\n$$ L_{\\text{seg}} = 1 - \\overline{W}^{\\ast} = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{st}{s+t}\\right) = \\frac{st}{s+t} $$\nWe are given the parameter values $s=0.1$ and $t=0.1$. Substituting these into the expression for segregation load:\n$$ L_{\\text{seg}} = \\frac{(0.1)(0.1)}{0.1 + 0.1} = \\frac{0.01}{0.2} = 0.05 $$\n\n**Part 3: Interpretation**\n\nThe segregation load of $L_{\\text{seg}} = 0.05$ represents a $5\\%$ reduction in the population's mean viability compared to a hypothetical population composed entirely of the fittest genotype ($Aa$). This \"load\" is an unavoidable cost of maintaining genetic diversity at this locus through balancing selection. Because heterozygotes do not breed true, they invariably produce less-fit homozygous offspring through genetic segregation, which lowers the overall mean fitness of the population.\n\nWhen fitness effects across many such loci are multiplicative and loci are in linkage equilibrium, the total mean fitness of the population is the product of the mean fitnesses at each locus: $\\overline{W}_{\\text{total}} = \\prod_i \\overline{W}_i^{\\ast}$. The mean fitness at each locus $i$ is $\\overline{W}_i^{\\ast} = 1 - L_i$. Therefore, each locus maintained by overdominance contributes a factor of $(1 - L_i)$ to the total mean fitness, multiplicatively reducing the population's overall viability. A large number of such polymorphisms could impose a substantial total load on the population.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.05}\n$$", "id": "2717744"}, {"introduction": "A significant portion of a population's genetic load consists of rare, recessive deleterious alleles, whose effects are masked in heterozygotes.

Rearranging this equation:\n$$ \\ln(\\bar{w}(F)) - \\ln(\\bar{w}(0)) = -B F $$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\bar{w}(F)}{\\bar{w}(0)}\\right) = -B F $$\nExponentiating both sides yields the ratio of mean viabilities:\n$$ \\frac{\\bar{w}(F)}{\\bar{w}(0)} = \\exp(-B F) $$\nThe problem defines the proportional change in mean viability, $\\Delta$, as:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{\\bar{w}(F)}{\\bar{w}(0)} - 1 $$\nSubstituting our derived expression for the ratio of mean viabilities:\n$$ \\Delta(B, F) = \\exp(-B F) - 1 $$\nThis is the required dependence of $\\Delta$ on $B$ and $F$.\n\nNow, we evaluate $\\Delta$ for the specified values: $F = \\frac{1}{2}$ (one generation of self-fertilization) and $B = 3$ lethal equivalents per diploid genome.\n$$ \\Delta = \\exp\\left(-3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - 1 $$\n$$ \\Delta = \\exp(-1.5) - 1 $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ \\exp(-1.5) \\approx 0.22313016... $$\n$$ \\Delta \\approx 0.22313016... - 1 = -0.77686983... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\Delta \\approx -0.7769 $$\n\nThe interpretation of this result is that after one generation of selfing, the mean viability of the population is expected to decrease by approximately $77.69\\%$. This severe drop in viability is known as inbreeding depression. It is a direct consequence of the increased homozygosity ($F = \\frac{1}{2}$) which exposes the effects of recessive deleterious alleles that constitute the genetic load, quantified here by $B=3$ lethal equivalents. The viability of the selfed offspring is only $1 + \\Delta \\approx 0.2231$ or $22.31\\%$ of the viability of the outbred parent population.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-0.7769}\n$$", "id": "2717749"}]}
