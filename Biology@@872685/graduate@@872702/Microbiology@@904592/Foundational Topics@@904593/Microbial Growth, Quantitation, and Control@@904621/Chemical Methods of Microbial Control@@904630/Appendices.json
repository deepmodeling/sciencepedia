We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem states that the rate of inactivation, $-\\frac{dN}{dt}$, is proportional to the number of viable cells, $N$, under conditions of constant disinfectant concentration, temperature, and pH. This is the definition of first-order inactivation kinetics, often referred to as Chick's law. Mathematically, this is expressed as a differential equation:\n$$ -\\frac{dN}{dt} = k' N $$\nwhere $k'$ is the first-order inactivation rate constant. The constant $k'$ incorporates the effects of disinfectant concentration, which is fixed in this experiment. This equation can be solved by separation of variables:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{N} = -k' dt $$\nWe integrate this equation from the initial time $t=0$, where the population is $N(0) = N_0$, to a general time $t$, where the population is $N(t)$.\n$$ \\int_{N_0}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{N} dN = \\int_{0}^{t} -k' d\\tau $$\nThe integration yields:\n$$ \\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N_0) = -k't $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = -k't $$\nExponentiating both sides gives the exponential decay model for the number of viable cells:\n$$ N(t) = N_0 \\exp(-k't) $$\nTo derive the functional form of $\\log_{10} N(t)$ versus $t$, we take the base-$10$ logarithm of both sides of the preceding equation:\n$$ \\log_{10}(N(t)) = \\log_{10}(N_0 \\exp(-k't)) $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\log(ab) = \\log(a) + \\log(b)$, we have:\n$$ \\log_{10}(N(t)) = \\log_{10}(N_0) + \\log_{10}(\\exp(-k't)) $$\nUsing the change of base formula for logarithms, $\\log_{b}(x^y) = y \\log_{b}(x)$ and $\\log_{10}(e) = \\frac{\\ln(e)}{\\ln(10)} = \\frac{1}{\\ln(10)}$, we can write:\n$$ \\log_{10}(\\exp(-k't)) = -k't \\log_{10}(e) = -k't \\frac{1}{\\ln(10)} = -\\frac{k'}{\\ln(10)} t $$\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $\\log_{10}(N(t))$ yields the required functional form:\n$$ \\log_{10}(N(t)) = \\log_{10}(N_0) - \\left(\\frac{k'}{\\ln(10)}\\right) t $$\nThis equation is of the linear form $y = c + mx$, where $y = \\log_{10}(N(t))$, the independent variable is $x = t$, the y-intercept is $c = \\log_{10}(N_0)$, and the slope is $m = -\\frac{k'}{\\ln(10)}$. Thus, a plot of the base-$10$ logarithm of the viable cell concentration versus time is predicted to be a straight line with a negative slope.\n\nThe decimal reduction time, $D$, is defined as the time required to reduce the viable cell population by a factor of $10$, or by one logarithm on the base-$10$ scale.

We have two relations: $m = -\\frac{k'}{\\ln(10)}$ and $D = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{k'}$. From the expression for the slope, we can write $k' = -m \\ln(10)$. Substituting this into the expression for $D$:\n$$ D = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{-m \\ln(10)} = -\\frac{1}{m} $$\nTherefore, the decimal reduction time is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the line obtained by plotting $\\log_{10} N$ against $t$.\n\nWe now perform an ordinary least squares linear regression on the provided dataset to estimate the slope $m$.

To achieve the required equality, the upper limit of integration for the lesser function must be larger. That is, $t_{\\text{actual}}$ must be greater than $t_{\\text{simple}}$. Therefore, the simplified calculation underpredicts the contact time required to achieve the target inactivation $L_{\\text{req}}$. Using $t_{\\text{simple}}$ would result in insufficient disinfection.\n\nFinally, we address the third task: defining and deriving the effective concentration-time, $CT_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t)$.
