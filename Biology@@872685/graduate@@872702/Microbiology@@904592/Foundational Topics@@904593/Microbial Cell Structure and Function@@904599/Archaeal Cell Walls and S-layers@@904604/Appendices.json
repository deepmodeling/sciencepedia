The model of an archaeal cell as a sphere covered by a hexagonal S-layer is a standard and physically realistic approximation in microbiology. The provided dimensions for the cell radius ($r = 0.6\\ \\mu\\text{m}$) and the S-layer lattice constant ($a = 18\\ \\text{nm}$) are consistent with experimentally observed values. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient information to derive a unique estimate. The language is objective and precise. The explicit assumption to neglect lattice defects and seams, which are required to tile a sphere with a purely hexagonal lattice (as per Euler's polyhedral formula, which necessitates the presence of non-hexagonal polygons), and the assumption of local planarity, render the problem a well-defined exercise in geometric approximation. These are standard simplifications for such estimations. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Solution Derivation**\nThe problem requires an estimation of the total number of protein subunits, $N$, needed to tile the surface of a spherical cell. This is achieved by dividing the total surface area of the cell, $A_{\\text{cell}}$, by the effective area occupied by a single subunit, $A_{\\text{subunit}}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the surface area of the archaeal cell. Approximating the cell as a sphere with radius $r$, the surface area is given by the formula:\n$$A_{\\text{cell}} = 4\\pi r^2$$\n\nNext, we must determine the area occupied by a single protein subunit. The subunits are arranged in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice with a lattice constant $a$, which is the distance between the centers of adjacent subunits. A hexagonal lattice can be tiled by primitive unit cells, each containing one lattice point. The conventional primitive unit cell is a rhombus composed of two equilateral triangles with side length $a$.\n\nThe area of an equilateral triangle with side length $a$ is:\n$$A_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2$$\n\nThe area of the rhombic primitive unit cell, which we take as the area per lattice point (and thus per subunit, as per the problem statement), is twice the area of one such triangle:\n$$A_{\\text{subunit}} = 2 \\times A_{\\text{triangle}} = 2 \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2 \\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} a^2$$\nThe problem's assumption of \"local planarity\" justifies using this planar area calculation for a small patch of the cell's curved surface.\n\nThe total number of subunits, $N$, is the ratio of the total cell surface area to the area per subunit:\n$$N = \\frac{A_{\\text{cell}}}{A_{\\text{subunit}}} = \\frac{4\\pi r^2}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} a^2} = \\frac{8\\pi r^2}{\\sqrt{3} a^2}$$\n\nBefore substituting the numerical values, we must ensure consistent units. The radius is given as $r = 0.6\\ \\mu\\text{m}$ and the lattice constant as $a = 18\\ \\text{nm}$. We convert the radius to nanometers:\n$$r = 0.6\\ \\mu\\text{m} = 0.6 \\times 10^3\\ \\text{nm} = 600\\ \\text{nm}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the values for $r$ and $a$ into the expression for $N$:\n$$N = \\frac{8\\pi (600\\ \\text{nm})^2}{\\sqrt{3} (18\\ \\text{nm})^2} = \\frac{8\\pi (360000)}{\\sqrt{3} (324)}$$\nThe units of $\\text{nm}^2$ in the numerator and denominator cancel, yielding a dimensionless count as required.\n\nNow, we carry out the numerical computation:\n$$N = \\frac{8 \\times \\pi \\times 360000}{ \\sqrt{3} \\times 324} \\approx \\frac{9047786.84}{561.18446} \\approx 16122.45$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$N \\approx 16120$$\nIn standard scientific notation, this is $1.612 \\times 10^4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.612 \\times 10^{4}}$$", "id": "2473967"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theoretical models to experimental observation, this exercise simulates the process of a biophysicist interpreting real-world data.

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) in PeakForce tapping mode is used to obtain a height map of an intact archaeal S-layer at physiological conditions. From first principles, treat the S-layer as a periodic surface whose height field $h(x,y)$ can be decomposed into spatial Fourier components.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe solution requires a sequential analysis of the provided data, guided by first principles of crystallography and elasticity.\n\n1.  **Determination of Lattice Symmetry**:\n    The structure of the reciprocal lattice is obtained directly from the Power Spectral Density (PSD) plot. The PSD shows the squared magnitudes of the spatial Fourier components of the surface topography. For a periodic lattice, the PSD will exhibit sharp peaks at positions corresponding to the reciprocal lattice vectors, $\\mathbf{G}_{hk}$.\n    The observation of $6$ prominent first-order peaks of equal magnitude $\\lvert \\mathbf{k} \\rvert \\approx k_0$, separated by angular intervals of $60^\\circ$, is the unambiguous signature of a hexagonal lattice. For a 2D hexagonal lattice, the basis vectors of the reciprocal lattice also form a hexagonal pattern. Any other 2D Bravais lattice (oblique, rectangular, centered rectangular, square) would produce a different pattern of primary peaks. For example, a square lattice would produce $4$ peaks separated by $90^\\circ$. Therefore, the S-layer possesses hexagonal symmetry.\n\n2.  **Calculation of Real-Space Periodicity**:\n    The magnitude of the fundamental reciprocal lattice vector is given as $k_0 \\approx 0.31\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$. This spatial frequency corresponds to a characteristic real-space periodicity, $d$, given by the relation $d = 2\\pi/k_0$.\n    $$d = \\frac{2\\pi}{k_0} \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 3.14159}{0.31\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}} \\approx 20.27\\,\\mathrm{nm}$$\n    This value, approximately $20\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, represents the fundamental repeating distance in the real-space lattice, often referred to colloquially as the lattice constant in this context, though technically it is the spacing between the $(10)$ planes.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Mechanical Properties**:\n    The problem states that the measured amplitude of the corrugation can be attenuated by linear elastic deformation. During AFM imaging in a contact or intermittent-contact mode, the tip exerts a normal force $F$ on the sample. This force causes a local indentation, $z_{indent}$. The measured height, $h_{meas}$, is the sum of the scanner's height and this indentation. The apparent corrugation amplitude, $A$, is therefore less than the true, unperturbed amplitude, $A_0$.\n    According to the principles of linear elasticity (Hooke's Law for indentation), the indentation depth is proportional to the applied force and inversely proportional to the effective stiffness, $k_{eff}$, of the material under the tip: $z_{indent} \\propto F/k_{eff}$. A material with lower stiffness (i.e., higher compliance) will deform more under the same force $F$.\n    We are given two real-space measurements under identical force $F$:\n    - Corrugation along the $x$-direction: $A_x \\approx 0.40\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n    - Corrugation along the $y$-direction: $A_y \\approx 0.80\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n    We observe that $A_x \\approx \\frac{1}{2} A_y$. Since the measured amplitude is the true amplitude minus the force-induced deformation, a smaller measured amplitude implies a larger deformation. Because the force $F$ is constant, a larger deformation along the $x$-direction implies that the S-layer has a lower effective stiffness (or greater compliance) along the laboratory $x$-direction compared to the $y$-direction. This is a direct indication of an **anisotropic elastic response**.\n\n4.  **Consistency Check with PSD Amplitudes**:\n    The real-space corrugation amplitude is related to the amplitude of the Fourier components. A smaller real-space corrugation $A_x$ will result in smaller corresponding Fourier amplitudes $|H(\\mathbf{k})|$ for wavevectors $\\mathbf{k}$ aligned with the $k_x$-axis. The PSD is $S(\\mathbf{k}) = \\lvert H(\\mathbf{k}) \\rvert^2$.\n    The data states $S(k_0,0^\\circ) \\approx S(k_0,180^\\circ) \\approx \\tfrac{1}{2} S(k_0,90^\\circ) \\approx \\tfrac{1}{2} S(k_0,270^\\circ)$. This means the PSD signal for the wavevector components along the $k_x$-axis is half that of the components along the $k_y$-axis. This is consistent with the real-space observation that the measured corrugation is smaller in the $x$-direction. Both sets of data independently and consistently support the conclusion of elastic anisotropy.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A.

The calculation $2\\pi/k_0 \\approx 20\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ correctly identifies the principal real-space periodicity.\n    - **Elastic Response**: Correct. The observation $A_x < A_y$ under constant force $F$ implies greater indentation and thus greater compliance (lower stiffness) in the $x$-direction.\n    - **Verdict**: **Correct**. This statement provides a complete and accurate synthesis of all provided information.\n\n- **B. The S-layer has square symmetry with a real-space lattice constant of approximately $10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, and the apparent anisotropy arises solely from tip-convolution artifacts rather than mechanics.**\n    - **Lattice Symmetry**: Incorrect. The $6$-fold symmetric PSD pattern rules out a $4$-fold symmetric square lattice.\n    - **Anisotropy Source**: Incorrect. The problem explicitly directs the use of linear elastic principles and states that instrumental artifacts were ruled out.\n    - **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C. The S-layer has hexagonal symmetry, but the elastic response is isotropic; the amplitude differences in both $S(k_0,\\theta)$ and $A_x$ versus $A_y$ are explained by higher-order harmonics of the lattice without mechanical effects.**\n    - **Elastic Response**: Incorrect. If the elastic response were isotropic, the indentation would be uniform for equivalent structural features. The difference in measured amplitudes ($A_x \\neq A_y$) under the same force could not be explained. The premise of \"higher-order harmonics\" is not a valid physical reason for symmetry-equivalent first-order peaks to have different amplitudes or for real-space corrugation to be direction-dependent under a uniform mechanical probe, especially when the problem explicitly primes us to consider elastic deformation.\n    - **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. The S-layer has an oblique lattice with no rotational symmetry; the $6$ peaks at $\\lvert \\mathbf{k} \\rvert \\approx k_0$ are higher-order artifacts unrelated to the fundamental lattice periodicity, so no mechanical inference can be drawn.**\n    - **Lattice Symmetry**: Incorrect. This is a baseless interpretation. A regular hexagon of primary peaks is the canonical signature of a hexagonal lattice, not an artifact pattern from an oblique lattice. This contradicts fundamental crystallography.\n    - **Mechanical Inference**: Incorrect. A clear mechanical inference can be drawn from the real-space amplitude data ($A_x$, $A_y$) and the force $F$.\n    - **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nThe single best interpretation is unequivocally option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2473975"}, {"introduction": "The S-layer is not merely a static shield; it is an active mechanical component in the cell's life cycle.

The system is axisymmetric and mirror-symmetric about the equatorial plane ($z=0$) where the ring of radius $r$ is located. Let the shape of the membrane in the meridional plane be described by a profile $\\rho(z)$, where $\\rho$ is the radial coordinate and $z$ is the axial coordinate. The furrow radius is $r=\\rho(0)$. Mirror symmetry implies $\\rho(z)=\\rho(-z)$.\nFor a force balance to be possible against the constrictive ring, the membrane must form a neck. A smooth turn-around of the surface at the point of maximum constriction implies that the tangent to the profile is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry. Let $\\psi$ be the angle between the tangent to the meridian and the $z$-axis. A tangent perpendicular to the $z$-axis corresponds to $\\psi=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. This represents the physically justified boundary condition for a symmetric furrow under tension.\n\nTo find the equilibrium radius $r^{\\ast}$, we use a direct force balance approach at the ring. Consider a small arc segment of the ring of length $ds$. The line tension $\\tau$ acts tangentially at the ends of the segment. The net force due to line tension is directed radially inward and has magnitude $\\tau \\frac{ds}{r}$. So, the inward force per unit length is $\\frac{\\tau}{r}$.\nThis inward force is balanced by the outward radial pull from the membrane surface tension $\\sigma$. The force from the membrane per unit length of the ring is $\\sigma$, directed along the tangent. From both sides of the furrow ($z>0$ and $z0$), the total radial component of this force per unit length is $2\\sigma \\sin\\psi$.\nAt equilibrium, these forces must balance:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau}{r} = 2\\sigma \\sin\\psi\n$$\nThis is the force-balance (or transversality) condition at the ring.\n\nTo find the equilibrium radius $r^{\\ast}$, we apply the \"symmetry constraint at the furrow\".
