Consider an archaeal membrane whose hydrophobic core is spanned by a single biphytanyl chain of carbon number $n_{\\mathrm{arch}} = 40$ (treat the isoprenoid chain, for the purpose of hydrophobic length, as an all-trans hydrocarbon of the same carbon count), and a bacterial membrane composed of diacyl $C_{16}$ lipids (each acyl chain has $n_{\\mathrm{bac}} = 16$ carbons). Assume:\n- All chains are in the all-trans conformation with zero tilt relative to the membrane normal.\n- The hydrophobic core thickness of a monolayer equals the projected chain length, and that of a bilayer equals twice the projected chain length.\n- The projected length of an all-trans hydrocarbon chain with $n$ carbons is given by the Tanford relation $l(n) = a + b\\,(n - 1)$, where $a = 1.5$ Å and $b = 1.265$ Å.\n\nUsing only these assumptions and relations, compute the difference in hydrophobic core thickness between the archaeal tetraether monolayer and the bacterial diacyl $C_{16}$ bilayer,\n$$\\Delta d = d_{\\mathrm{arch}} - d_{\\mathrm{bac}},$$\nand report your answer in angstroms.

Your discussion will not be graded numerically, but it must be rooted in the quantitative result you obtain for $\\Delta d$ and in the stated assumptions.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is based on established biophysical models and principles, such as the Tanford relation for hydrocarbon chain length and the concept of hydrophobic matching in biological membranes. All necessary parameters and definitions are provided to compute a unique, meaningful solution for the quantitative part of the problem. The qualitative reasoning requested is a direct and logical extension of the quantitative result. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the difference in hydrophobic core thickness, $\\Delta d$, between an archaeal tetraether monolayer and a bacterial diacyl bilayer. The thickness is defined by the length of the constituent hydrocarbon chains.\n\nFirst, we calculate the hydrophobic thickness of the archaeal monolayer, $d_{\\mathrm{arch}}$. According to the problem statement, this thickness is equal to the projected length of a single biphytanyl chain containing $n_{\\mathrm{arch}} = 40$ carbon atoms. The projected length, $l(n)$, is given by the Tanford relation:\n$$l(n) = a + b\\,(n - 1)$$\nwhere $a = 1.5$ Å and $b = 1.265$ Å.\n\nFor the archaeal membrane, with $n_{\\mathrm{arch}} = 40$:\n$$d_{\\mathrm{arch}} = l(n_{\\mathrm{arch}}) = a + b\\,(n_{\\mathrm{arch}} - 1)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$d_{\\mathrm{arch}} = 1.5\\,\\text{Å} + (1.265\\,\\text{Å}) \\times (40 - 1)$$\n$$d_{\\mathrm{arch}} = 1.5\\,\\text{Å} + (1.265\\,\\text{Å}) \\times 39$$\n$$d_{\\mathrm{arch}} = 1.5\\,\\text{Å} + 49.335\\,\\text{Å} = 50.835\\,\\text{Å}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the hydrophobic thickness of the bacterial bilayer, $d_{\\mathrm{bac}}$. The membrane is composed of lipids with acyl chains of $n_{\\mathrm{bac}} = 16$ carbons. A bilayer's hydrophobic core thickness is stated to be twice the projected length of one acyl chain.\n$$d_{\\mathrm{bac}} = 2 \\times l(n_{\\mathrm{bac}})$$\nUsing the Tanford relation with $n_{\\mathrm{bac}} = 16$:\n$$d_{\\mathrm{bac}} = 2 \\times [a + b\\,(n_{\\mathrm{bac}} - 1)]$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$d_{\\mathrm{bac}} = 2 \\times [1.5\\,\\text{Å} + (1.265\\,\\text{Å}) \\times (16 - 1)]$$\n$$d_{\\mathrm{bac}} = 2 \\times [1.5\\,\\text{Å} + (1.265\\,\\text{Å}) \\times 15]$$\n$$d_{\\mathrm{bac}} = 2 \\times [1.5\\,\\text{Å} + 18.975\\,\\text{Å}]$$\n$$d_{\\mathrm{bac}} = 2 \\times 20.475\\,\\text{Å} = 40.95\\,\\text{Å}$$\n\nNow, we compute the difference $\\Delta d = d_{\\mathrm{arch}} - d_{\\mathrm{bac}}$:\n$$\\Delta d = 50.835\\,\\text{Å} - 40.95\\,\\text{Å} = 9.885\\,\\text{Å}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\Delta d \\approx 9.89\\,\\text{Å}$$\n\nFor the second part of the inquiry, we must reason about the implications of this thickness difference for transmembrane helices. The principle of hydrophobic matching dictates that the length of a transmembrane protein's hydrophobic domain should ideally match the hydrophobic thickness of the membrane to minimize the system's free energy. Mismatch leads to energetic penalties from either exposing hydrophobic protein residues to the aqueous phase or exposing polar lipid headgroups to the nonpolar membrane core.\n\nGiven the rise per residue of an ideal $\\alpha$-helix is $h = 1.5$ Å/residue, we can estimate the number of residues, $N$, required to span each membrane with zero tilt:\nFor the bacterial membrane:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{bac}} = \\frac{d_{\\mathrm{bac}}}{h} = \\frac{40.95\\,\\text{Å}}{1.5\\,\\text{Å/residue}} = 27.3\\,\\text{residues}$$\nA typical transmembrane helix in such a bacterium would therefore contain approximately $27$ to $28$ residues in its hydrophobic core.\n\nFor the archaeal membrane:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{arch}} = \\frac{d_{\\mathrm{arch}}}{h} = \\frac{50.835\\,\\text{Å}}{1.5\\,\\text{Å/residue}} = 33.89\\,\\text{residues}$$\nA transmembrane helix in this archaeon would need to be significantly longer, approximately $34$ residues.\n\nThe computed difference in thickness, $\\Delta d \\approx 9.89$ Å, corresponds to an additional length of $\\Delta d / h \\approx 9.89 / 1.5 \\approx 6.6$ residues. This is a substantial difference.\n\nIf a protein with a transmembrane helix optimized for the bacterial bilayer (length $\\approx 41$ Å) were inserted into the archaeal monolayer (thickness $\\approx 51$ Å), a severe positive hydrophobic mismatch would occur ($d_{\\mathrm{helix}} < d_{\\mathrm{membrane}}$). The system must adapt to minimize the associated free energy penalty. The possible adaptations are:\n$1$. **Membrane Deformation**: The most direct and immediate response is for the lipid monolayer to locally deform around the short protein. The membrane will thin in the immediate vicinity of the protein to match its hydrophobic length. This deformation induces curvature and compression stress in the lipid chains, which is energetically unfavorable. The energetic cost of this deformation is proportional to the square of the mismatch, $(\\Delta d)^2$, and the circumference of the protein.\n$2$. **Helix Tilting**: Tilting the helix is a common adaptation for a protein that is *longer* than the membrane is thick (negative mismatch). A tilted helix of length $L$ has a projected perpendicular length of $L\\cos(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the tilt angle. For a protein that is too *short*, as in this scenario, tilting would only decrease its projected length, thus *worsening* the hydrophobic mismatch. Therefore, tilting is not a viable adaptation mechanism here.\n$3$. **Protein Oligomerization**: If multiple mismatched proteins are present, they may aggregate. By forming oligomers, they reduce the total surface area of the protein-lipid interface that is subject to the energetically costly membrane thinning, thereby minimizing the overall free energy penalty.\n\nIn summary, the significant positive mismatch of $\\Delta d \\approx 9.89$ Å would force the archaeal monolayer to undergo substantial local thinning to accommodate the shorter bacterial helix, an energetically costly process that could drive protein aggregation. Evolutionary adaptation, by contrast, would favor proteins with longer transmembrane helices (by approximately $6$ to $7$ residues) to achieve proper matching in archaea with such thick membranes.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{9.89}\n$$", "id": "2505840"}, {"introduction": "Biological membranes are not just passive barriers; they are dynamic energy-transducing systems.
