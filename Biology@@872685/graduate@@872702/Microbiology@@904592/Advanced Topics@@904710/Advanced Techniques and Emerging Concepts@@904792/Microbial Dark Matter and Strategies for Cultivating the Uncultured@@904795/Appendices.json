The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous mathematical derivation. It is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe objective is to find the minimal integer sequencing depth, denoted by $n$, required to ensure that the probability of detecting a target taxon, present at a relative abundance $p$, is at least $0.95$. Detection is defined as observing at least one sequence read originating from this taxon.\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing the number of reads from the target taxon in a total of $n$ reads. The problem states that the sequencing process can be modeled as a series of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials. Each trial corresponds to a single read. A \"success\" is defined as a read originating from the target taxon, which occurs with probability $p$. A \"failure\" is a read from any other taxon, occurring with probability $1-p$.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the random variable $X$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n$ (the number of trials) and $p$ (the probability of success). We write this as $X \\sim B(n, p)$. The probability mass function of this distribution gives the probability of observing exactly $k$ successes in $n$ trials:\n$$P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\nfor $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nThe condition for detection is that at least one read from the target taxon is observed. This corresponds to the event $X \\ge 1$. The problem requires that the probability of this event be at least $0.95$:\n$$P(X \\ge 1) \\ge 0.95$$\n\nCalculating $P(X \\ge 1)$ directly involves summing probabilities for $k=1, 2, \\dots, n$. It is more straightforward to consider the complement event, which is observing zero reads from the target taxon, i.e., $X=0$. The relationship between the event and its complement is:\n$$P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0)$$\n\nUsing the binomial probability mass function for $k=0$:\n$$P(X=0) = \\binom{n}{0} p^0 (1-p)^{n-0} = (1)(1)(1-p)^n = (1-p)^n$$\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression back into the inequality:\n$$1 - (1-p)^n \\ge 0.95$$\n\nThe task is to solve this inequality for the smallest integer $n$. Rearranging the terms, we have:\n$$- (1-p)^n \\ge 0.95 - 1$$\n$$- (1-p)^n \\ge -0.05$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality sign:\n$$(1-p)^n \\le 0.05$$\n\nTo isolate $n$, we apply the natural logarithm to both sides of the inequality. Since the problem specifies $p \\in (0,1)$, it follows that $0  1-p  1$. The natural logarithm of any number in this interval is negative, i.e., $\\ln(1-p)  0$. Therefore, when we divide the inequality by $\\ln(1-p)$, we must reverse the inequality sign again.\n$$\\ln((1-p)^n) \\le \\ln(0.05)$$\n$$n \\ln(1-p) \\le \\ln(0.05)$$\n$$n \\ge \\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\ln(1-p)}$$\nNote that $\\ln(0.05)$ is also negative, so the ratio on the right-hand side is a positive real number, as expected for a quantity like sequencing depth.\n\nThe problem demands the minimal *integer* value of $n$ that satisfies this condition.

A foundational rationale is that contigs from the same genome have similar coverage across independent metagenomic samples and similar oligonucleotide composition, such as tetranucleotide frequency profiles. Relying on this rationale and without assuming any particular downstream binning algorithm, construct from first principles a hard-assignment optimization problem that clusters contigs into a fixed number of genome bins by minimizing within-bin dispersion in both coverage and tetranucleotide spaces under appropriate constraints. Then, apply your formulation to a concrete toy dataset to compute the minimal objective value.\n\nAssume the following data measured for $3$ metagenomic samples and a reduced $2$-feature tetranucleotide frequency profile (normalized to sum to $1$ for each contig).

At steady state, the net rate of oxygen diffusion into the shell must balance the rate of oxygen consumption within the shell volume.\n\nThe inward flux of oxygen at radius $r$ is $J(r)$, and the outward flux at $r+dr$ is $J(r+dr)$.

This is the intrinsic length scale over which the concentration attenuates. From our derivation, this length scale appeared naturally as $\\delta = \\sqrt{D/k}$. In the limit of a very large aggregate where $R \\gg \\delta$, the concentration profile near the surface ($r \\approx R$) can be approximated. Let $x = R-r$ be the depth from the surface. For $R/\\delta \\to \\infty$ and $r/\\delta \\to \\infty$, we can use the approximation $\\sinh(z) \\approx \\exp(z)/2$.\n$$C(r) \\approx C_0 \\frac{R}{r} \\frac{\\exp(r/\\delta)}{\\exp(R/\\delta)} = C_0 \\frac{R}{r} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{R-r}{\\delta}\\right)$$\nSince $r \\approx R$, the factor $R/r \\approx 1$. The profile decays exponentially from the surface with a characteristic length $\\delta = \\sqrt{D/k}$. This is the oxygen penetration depth.\n\nFor the third part, we need a criterion for an anoxic core, $C(0) \\le \\varepsilon C_0$. We first evaluate $C(0)$ using the limit $r \\to 0$ on our solution for $C(r)$:\n$$C(0) = \\lim_{r \\to 0} C(r) = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\left(C_0 \\frac{R}{r} \\frac{\\sinh(r/\\delta)}{\\sinh(R/\\delta)}\\right)$$\nUsing the approximation $\\sinh(r/\\delta) \\approx r/\\delta$ as $r \\to 0$:\n$$C(0) = C_0 \\frac{R}{\\sinh(R/\\delta)} \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\frac{r/\\delta}{r} = C_0 \\frac{R/\\delta}{\\sinh(R/\\delta)}$$\nThe criterion for an anoxic core is thus:\n$$C_0 \\frac{R/\\delta}{\\sinh(R/\\delta)} \\le \\varepsilon C_0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{R/\\delta}{\\sinh(R/\\delta)} \\le \\varepsilon$$\nTo find the minimal radius $R_{\\varepsilon}$, we solve the equality for the dimensionless group $\\Phi_{\\varepsilon} = R_{\\varepsilon}/\\delta$:\n$$\\frac{\\Phi_{\\varepsilon}}{\\sinh(\\Phi_{\\varepsilon})} = \\varepsilon$$\nFor $\\varepsilon \\ll 1$, this requires $\\Phi_{\\varepsilon}$ to be large. In this regime, $\\sinh(\\Phi_{\\varepsilon}) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(\\Phi_{\\varepsilon})$. The equation becomes $\\frac{\\Phi_{\\varepsilon}}{\\frac{1}{2}\\exp(\\Phi_{\\varepsilon})} \\approx \\varepsilon \\implies \\Phi_{\\varepsilon} \\exp(-\\Phi_{\\varepsilon}) \\approx \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}$. This is a transcendental equation whose solution is given by the Lambert W function. Rewriting as $(-\\Phi_{\\varepsilon})\\exp(-\\Phi_{\\varepsilon}) \\approx -\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}$, we find that $-\\Phi_{\\varepsilon} \\approx W(-\\varepsilon/2)$. For a large $\\Phi_{\\varepsilon} > 0$, we must use the lower branch, $W_{-1}$.\n$$\\Phi_{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{R_{\\varepsilon}}{\\delta} \\approx -W_{-1}(-\\varepsilon/2)$$\nSolving for $R_{\\varepsilon}$ and substituting $\\delta=\\sqrt{D/k}$:\n$$R_{\\varepsilon} \\approx -\\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}} W_{-1}\\left(-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}\\right)$$\nThis provides the closed-form expression for the minimal radius to form an anoxic core.\n\nFinally, for the fourth part, the derived expressions provide a quantitative basis for understanding microbial niche partitioning.\nThe model shows that an anoxic microenvironment ($C(r) \\approx 0$) can arise within a microbial aggregate even when the surrounding bulk fluid is fully oxic ($C(R)=C_0$). The key condition is that the rate of oxygen consumption within the aggregate is large relative to the rate of oxygen diffusion into it. This condition is captured by the Thiele modulus, $\\Phi=R\\sqrt{k/D}$. If the aggregate radius $R$ is large, the diffusion coefficient $D$ is low (e.g., in a dense biofilm matrix), or the metabolic consumption rate constant $k$ is high, then $\\Phi$ will be large, leading to a significant drop in oxygen concentration toward the center and the formation of an anoxic core. This explains the observed presence of obligate anaerobes in samples collected from nominally oxic habitats.\n\nThis principle directly informs strategies for cultivating \"uncultured\" anaerobes. One can engineer laboratory systems to replicate these diffusion-limited conditions. For example, growing cells in dense pellets, gels, or specialized microfluidic devices that restrict oxygen transport can create the necessary low-oxygen niches. Furthermore, the model explains the success of co-culture techniques. By growing a target anaerobe with a facultative or aerobic partner organism, the partner consumes ambient oxygen, effectively increasing the local volumetric consumption rate $k$. As our model shows, increasing $k$ increases $\\Phi$, which promotes the formation of an anoxic core where the anaerobic microbe can thrive. The aerobic partner acts as an oxygen sink, protecting its anaerobic counterpart.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}}}$$", "id": "2508944"}]}
