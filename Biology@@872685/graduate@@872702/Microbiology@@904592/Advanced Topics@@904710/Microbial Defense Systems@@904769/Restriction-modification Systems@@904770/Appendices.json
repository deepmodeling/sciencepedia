The concepts of circular plasmids, restriction endonucleases (specifically EcoRI), recognition sites, methylation, and complete digestion are well-established and factually correct. The specified lengths are physically plausible. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is unambiguous and provides all necessary information for a unique solution. The total length of the circular DNA and the distance between the two cut sites are given. The term \"complete digestion\" has a precise technical meaning.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from any subjective or non-scientific content.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. The given data are consistent; the total length of the circle ($3$ kb) is composed of two arcs, one of which is specified ($1$ kb), implying the other must be $3-1 = 2$ kb. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nStep 3: Solution Derivation.\nThe core principle is that the cleavage of a DNA molecule by a restriction endonuclease at its recognition sites generates a set of smaller, linear DNA fragments. The number of fragments produced depends on the topology of the initial DNA molecule (linear or circular) and the number of recognition sites.\n\nFor a covalently closed circular DNA molecule with $N$ distinct recognition sites, a complete digestion (cleavage at every site) will result in exactly $N$ linear fragments.\nIn this problem, the plasmid is circular and has $N=2$ EcoRI recognition sites. Therefore, complete digestion will yield $2$ linear fragments.\n\nThe lengths of these two fragments are determined by the lengths of the two arcs of DNA connecting the two restriction sites on the circular plasmid. Let the total length of the circular plasmid be $L_{total}$. The plasmid is partitioned into two arcs by the two EcoRI sites.\n\nThe length of the shorter arc is given as $d_{1} = 1$ kb.\nThe length of the longer arc, $d_{2}$, must be the remainder of the total circular length. This is calculated as:\n$$d_{2} = L_{total} - d_{1}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$L_{total} = 3 \\text{ kb}$$\n$$d_{1} = 1 \\text{ kb}$$\nThus, the length of the second fragment is:\n$$d_{2} = 3 \\text{ kb} - 1 \\text{ kb} = 2 \\text{ kb}$$\n\nUpon complete digestion, the circular plasmid is cut at both sites, releasing the two arcs as two distinct linear molecules. The sizes of these linear fragments are therefore $d_{1} = 1$ kb and $d_{2} = 2$ kb.\n\nAs a necessary check for conservation of material, the sum of the lengths of the resulting fragments must equal the total length of the original plasmid:\n$$d_{1} + d_{2} = 1 \\text{ kb} + 2 \\text{ kb} = 3 \\text{ kb}$$\nThis sum is indeed equal to $L_{total}$, which confirms the correctness of the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be presented as a row vector of the fragment sizes, ordered from smallest to largest. The calculated fragment sizes are $1$ kb and $2$ kb. Ordered from smallest to largest, they are $1$ and $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2529955"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the scale of a single plasmid to an entire genome requires a shift from deterministic calculation to probabilistic estimation.

It presents a standard problem in statistical genomics that can be solved using fundamental principles of probability theory. All provided assumptions are standard for such a model and permit a rigorous derivation. We proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for the expected number of recognition sites. Let $G$ be the length of the circular chromosome in base pairs and $r$ be the length of the specific recognition motif. The problem states that the DNA sequence has a uniform base composition, with each of the four bases $\\{ \\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{G}, \\mathrm{T} \\}$ occurring with a probability of $p_{base} = \\frac{1}{4}$. It is also assumed that the bases at different positions are independent.\n\nA specific recognition motif is a sequence of $r$ defined bases. Due to the independence of bases, the probability $p$ that a sequence of length $r$ starting at any given position matches the specific recognition motif is the product of the probabilities of each base in the motif.\n$$p = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^r = 4^{-r}$$\nTo find the expected number of recognition sites, $E[N]$, we define a set of indicator random variables. Let $X_i$ be an indicator variable for the event that a recognition site starts at position $i$ on the chromosome, for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, G$. Since the chromosome is circular, there are $G$ distinct possible starting positions.\nThe indicator variable $X_i$ is defined as:\n$$\nX_i = \n\\begin{cases} \n1 & \\text{if a recognition site starts at position } i \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise} \n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe expected value of an indicator variable is the probability of the event it indicates. Therefore, for any position $i$:\n$$E[X_i] = P(X_i = 1) = p = 4^{-r}$$\nThe total number of recognition sites, $N$, is the sum of these indicator variables over all possible starting positions:\n$$N = \\sum_{i=1}^{G} X_i$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected total number of sites is the sum of the individual expected values, regardless of whether the variables $X_i$ are independent.\n$$E[N] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{G} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{G} E[X_i]$$\nSince $E[X_i]$ is the same for all positions $i$, we have:\n$$E[N] = \\sum_{i=1}^{G} 4^{-r} = G \\cdot 4^{-r}$$\nThis is the general expression for the expected number of recognition sites.\n\nNext, we derive the general expression for the expected mean fragment length. The problem states that for the complete digestion of a circular chromosome, the number of resulting DNA fragments is equal to the number of recognition sites, $N$. The total length of the chromosome is $G$. The mean length of the fragments for a given digestion is therefore $\\frac{G}{N}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the *expected* mean fragment length. In this context, this is standardly interpreted as the total length of the genome divided by the *expected* number of sites. This interpretation is supported by the problem's hint to consider the mean waiting time for a geometric process. The occurrence of a site at any position can be modeled as a Bernoulli trial with success probability $p = 4^{-r}$. The expected distance between successive sites, which corresponds to the expected fragment length, is the mean of the corresponding geometric distribution, which is $\\frac{1}{p}$.\nLet $L_{mean}$ be the expected mean fragment length.\n$$L_{mean} = \\frac{G}{E[N]}$$\nSubstituting the previously derived expression for $E[N]$:\n$$L_{mean} = \\frac{G}{G \\cdot 4^{-r}} = \\frac{1}{4^{-r}} = 4^r$$\nThis is the general expression for the expected mean fragment length, measured in base pairs.\n\nFinally, we evaluate these two expressions numerically for the given values $G = 5.16096 \\times 10^{6}$ and $r = 6$.\n\nThe expected number of recognition sites is:\n$$E[N] = (5.16096 \\times 10^{6}) \\cdot 4^{-6} = \\frac{5160960}{4096} = 1260$$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to four significant figures. The number $1260$ can be written as $1.260 \\times 10^3$, which has four significant figures.\n\nThe expected mean fragment length is:\n$$L_{mean} = 4^r = 4^6 = 4096 \\text{ base pairs}$$\nThis result, $4096$, can be written as $4.096 \\times 10^3$, which already has four significant figures.\n\nThe two numerical results are $1260$ for the expected number of sites and $4096$ for the expected mean fragment length in base pairs.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1260 & 4096 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2529972"}, {"introduction": "The discovery of new enzymes often involves a process of biochemical detective work to determine their function and classification.

It is a well-formulated question in molecular biology that can be solved by applying the canonical definitions of restriction-modification system types. A detailed analysis will now be performed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe classification of NucX requires a systematic comparison of its observed properties against the defining features of the major R–M system types.\n\n**Type I R–M Systems**:\n-   **Cofactors**: Require ATP, SAM, and $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ for activity. This is consistent with NucX.\n-   **Recognition Site**: Typically asymmetric and often bipartite. This is consistent with NucX's asymmetric site.\n-   **Cleavage Action**: These enzymes bind to their recognition site and then translocate DNA, cleaving at variable and distant sites, often more than $1000~\\text{bp}$ away from the recognition sequence. This is a **critical inconsistency** with NucX, which cleaves at a short, fixed distance of $25 \\pm 1~\\text{bp}$.\n\n**Type II R–M Systems**:\n-   **Cofactors**: Canonical Type II enzymes require only $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ for cleavage. They do **not** require ATP or SAM. This is a **critical inconsistency** with NucX, which requires both ATP and SAM.\n-   **Recognition Site**: Typically palindromic. This is **inconsistent** with NucX's asymmetric site.\n-   **Cleavage Action**: Cleavage occurs at a specific position within or very close to the recognition site. While some subclasses (Type IIs) cleave at a short, fixed distance and can recognize asymmetric sites, the fundamental cofactor requirements (no ATP/SAM) rule out this classification.\n\n**Type III R–M Systems**:\n-   **Cofactors**: Require ATP and $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$. ATP hydrolysis fuels DNA translocation. This is **perfectly consistent** with NucX's requirement for ATP and the failure of $\\text{ATP}\\gamma\\text{S}$ to support activity. They also require SAM as an allosteric activator for restriction, though it is not consumed during cleavage. The observation that SAM is essential for NucX activity is the classic behavior of a Type III enzyme.\n-   **Recognition Site**: Asymmetric. This is **perfectly consistent** with NucX.\n-   **Cleavage Action**: These enzymes require two non-methylated recognition sites on the same DNA molecule, typically in a head-to-head (inverted) orientation. They bind to their respective sites and translocate toward each other. When the enzymes collide, DNA cleavage is triggered. This mechanism explains why a plasmid with a single site is not cleaved, whereas a plasmid with two inverted sites is an efficient substrate. This is **perfectly consistent** with NucX's substrate requirements.\n-   **Cleavage Position**: Cleavage occurs at a fixed, short distance (typically $25-27~\\text{bp}$) to one side of *one* of the recognition sites upon collision of the two enzyme complexes. This is **perfectly consistent** with the observed cleavage at $25 \\pm 1~\\text{bp}$ from a site.\n\n**Type IV R–M Systems**:\n-   **Cofactors**: Variable, but not typically the ATP/SAM/$\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ combination in this manner. For example, the McrBC system, a well-known Type IV system, requires GTP, not ATP.\n-   **Cleavage Action**: These are not true R-M systems. They are restriction enzymes that specifically recognize and cleave **modified** (e.g., methylated or hydroxymethylated) DNA. The problem describes the cleavage of a standard, presumably unmodified, plasmid substrate. There is no indication that the substrate must be modified for cleavage. This is a **critical inconsistency**.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation**:\nThe full set of experimental observations for NucX—the requirement for ATP hydrolysis, SAM, and $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$; the need for two inverted asymmetric recognition sites; and cleavage at a fixed, short distance from one site—are the defining, hallmark characteristics of a Type III restriction-modification system.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nA. **Type I restriction–modification system**: While the cofactor requirements ($\\text{Mg}^{2+}$, ATP, SAM) overlap, the cleavage position is a definitive point of exclusion. Type I enzymes cleave at random, distant locations, whereas NucX cleaves at a specific, proximal location ($25 \\pm 1~\\text{bp}$). Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\nB. **Type II restriction–modification system (canonical palindromic-site cutters)**: This classification fails on multiple grounds. Canonical Type II enzymes do not require ATP or SAM for cleavage, and they typically recognize palindromic sequences. NucX requires both cofactors and recognizes an asymmetric sequence. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\nC. **Type III restriction–modification system**: This classification is an exact match for all provided data points. The cofactor requirements ($\\text{Mg}^{2+}$, ATP hydrolysis, SAM stimulation), the recognition site (asymmetric), the substrate requirement (two sites in inverted orientation), and the cleavage mechanism (fixed distance of $25 \\pm 1~\\text{bp}$ from one site after collision) are all canonical features of Type III systems. Therefore, this option is **Correct**.\n\nD. **Type IV restriction system (modification-dependent restriction)**: This option is incorrect because Type IV systems are defined by their targeting of modified DNA. The problem provides no evidence for this requirement and instead presents a classic set of features associated with a different R-M type. The described mechanism does not match that of a Type IV system. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2529995"}]}
