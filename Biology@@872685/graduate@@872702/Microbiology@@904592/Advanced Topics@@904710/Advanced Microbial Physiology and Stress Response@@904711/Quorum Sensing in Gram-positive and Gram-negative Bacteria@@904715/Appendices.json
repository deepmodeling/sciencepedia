A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) and Steady-State Concentration**\n\nWe apply the principle of mass balance to the total amount of autoinducer in moles, `M(t)`, within the fixed volume `V`. The concentration `c(t)` is related to `M(t)` by `M(t) = c(t)V`. The mass balance equation is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of Generation}) - (\\text{Rate of Consumption})\n$$\n\nSince the volume `V` is constant, the rate of accumulation `\\frac{dM(t)}{dt}` can be expressed in terms of concentration as `V \\frac{dc(t)}{dt}`.\n\nThe rate of generation is the total production from all `N` cells. With each cell producing autoinducer at a rate `q`, the total generation rate is `Nq`.\n\nThe rate of consumption is due to first-order decay. According to mass-action kinetics, the rate of a first-order reaction is proportional to the amount of substance present. The rate of decay in moles per second is `k_d M(t) = k_d c(t) V`.\n\nSubstituting these terms into the mass balance equation:\n$$\nV \\frac{dc(t)}{dt} = Nq - k_d V c(t)\n$$\n\nTo obtain the ordinary differential equation for `c(t)`, we divide all terms by the volume `V`:\n$$\n\\frac{dc(t)}{dt} = \\frac{Nq}{V} - k_d c(t)\n$$\nThis is the required differential equation.\n\nThe steady-state concentration, `c^{*}`, is the concentration at which `\\frac{dc(t)}{dt} = 0`. Setting the left side of the ODE to zero:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{Nq}{V} - k_d c^{*}\n$$\nSolving for `c^{*}`:\n$$\nk_d c^{*} = \\frac{Nq}{V}\n$$\n$$\nc^{*} = \\frac{Nq}{Vk_d}\n$$\n\n**2. Formalization of Activation Condition and Minimal Cell Number `N_{min}`**\n\nQuorum sensing activation occurs when the steady-state concentration `c^{*}` meets or exceeds the threshold `K`. This is formalized as the inequality:\n$$\nc^{*} \\ge K\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for `c^{*}`:\n$$\n\\frac{Nq}{Vk_d} \\ge K\n$$\nTo find the condition on the cell number `N`, we rearrange the inequality:\n$$\nNq \\ge K V k_d\n$$\n$$\nN \\ge \\frac{K V k_d}{q}\n$$\nThe problem defines `N_{min}` as the smallest integer `N` that satisfies this condition. This corresponds to the ceiling of the expression on the right-hand side.\n$$\nN_{min} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{K V k_d}{q} \\right\\rceil\n$$\n\n**3. Evaluation of `N_{min}`**\n\nWe now substitute the provided parameter values into the expression for the lower bound of `N`:\n- `K = 5.0 \\times 10^{-8}` mol L$^{-1}$\n- `V = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}` L\n- `k_d = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}` s$^{-1}$\n- `q = 5.0 \\times 10^{-21}` mol s$^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate the value of the term `\\frac{K V k_d}{q}`:\n$$\n\\frac{K V k_d}{q} = \\frac{(5.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{mol L}^{-1}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{L}) (2.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{s}^{-1})}{5.0 \\times 10^{-21} \\, \\text{mol s}^{-1}}\n$$\nWe evaluate the numerator first:\n$$\nK V k_d = (5.0 \\times 1.0 \\times 2.0) \\times 10^{-8 - 3 - 4} \\, \\text{mol s}^{-1} = 10.0 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{mol s}^{-1} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14} \\, \\text{mol s}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we perform the division:\n$$\n\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-14} \\, \\text{mol s}^{-1}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-21} \\, \\text{mol s}^{-1}} = \\frac{1.0}{5.0} \\times 10^{-14 - (-21)} = 0.2 \\times 10^{7} = 2.0 \\times 10^{6}\n$$\nThe condition on `N` is therefore `N \\ge 2.0 \\times 10^{6}`.

The extracellular AIP concentration $A(t)$ evolves under a mass balance that includes production and first-order removal processes. The removal processes are: (i) baseline clearance (dilution plus nonspecific loss) with first-order rate constant $k_0$, and (ii) inactivation by extracellular proteases with first-order rate constant $k_p$.

It is based on established principles of chemical kinetics and receptor theory as applied to microbial quorum sensing. All necessary parameters and assumptions are provided to derive a unique and meaningful solution. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe analysis begins from the principle of mass conservation for the extracellular autoinducing peptide (AIP) concentration, denoted by $A(t)$. The rate of change of $A(t)$ in a well-mixed, constant volume system is given by the balance of production and removal rates. The total production rate is the product of the cell density, $n$, and the per-cell secretion rate, $s$. The removal of AIP is described by two parallel first-order processes: a baseline clearance with rate constant $k_0$ and proteolytic inactivation with rate constant $k_p$. The total first-order removal rate constant is the sum of the individual constants, $k_{tot} = k_0 + k_p$.\n\nThe differential equation governing the AIP concentration $A(t)$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = ns - (k_0 + k_p)A\n$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the system is at a steady state for constant $n$ and $s$. At steady state, the concentration $A$ does not change with time, meaning $\\frac{dA}{dt} = 0$. Let the steady-state concentration be $A_{ss}$. Setting the time derivative to zero yields:\n$$\n0 = ns - (k_0 + k_p)A_{ss}\n$$\nSolving for the steady-state concentration $A_{ss}$ gives:\n$$\nA_{ss} = \\frac{ns}{k_0 + k_p}\n$$\nThis equation shows that the steady-state AIP concentration is directly proportional to the total production flux, $ns$, and inversely proportional to the total removal rate constant, $k_0 + k_p$.\n\nThe activation of the agr system is contingent upon the fraction of occupied receptors, $f(A)$, reaching a critical threshold $\\alpha$. The receptor-ligand binding is at equilibrium and follows the law of mass action, giving the fractional occupancy as a function of AIP concentration $A$:\n$$\nf(A) = \\frac{A}{A + K_d}\n$$\nwhere $K_d$ is the dissociation constant. The threshold concentration for activation, $A_{\\mathrm{th}}$, is the concentration $A$ at which $f(A) = \\alpha$.\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{th}}}{A_{\\mathrm{th}} + K_d}\n$$\nWe solve this algebraic equation for $A_{\\mathrm{th}}$:\n$$\n\\alpha(A_{\\mathrm{th}} + K_d) = A_{\\mathrm{th}} \\\\\n\\alpha A_{\\mathrm{th}} + \\alpha K_d = A_{\\mathrm{th}} \\\\\n\\alpha K_d = A_{\\mathrm{th}}(1 - \\alpha) \\\\\nA_{\\mathrm{th}} = K_d \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha}\n$$\nThis is the minimum AIP concentration required to trigger the agr response.\n\n**1. Derivation of Minimal Population Density $n^{\\ast}$**\n\nThe minimal population density required for agr activation, denoted $n^{\\ast}$, is the density $n$ at which the steady-state AIP concentration $A_{ss}$ is exactly equal to the threshold concentration $A_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n$$\nA_{ss} = A_{\\mathrm{th}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions we derived for $A_{ss}$ and $A_{\\mathrm{th}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{n^{\\ast}s}{k_0 + k_p} = K_d \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha}\n$$\nSolving for $n^{\\ast}$ yields the general expression for the minimal activation density:\n$$\nn^{\\ast} = \\frac{(k_0 + k_p)K_d}{s} \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha}\n$$\nWe now apply this general result to the two specific cases requested.\n\nCase (i): In the absence of proteases ($k_p = 0$).\nLet the minimal density in this case be $n^{\\ast}_{\\text{no-p}}$.

Fold-Increase in Minimal Production Flux**\n\nThe production flux is the product $ns$. The minimal production flux required for activation is $J^{\\ast} = n^{\\ast}s$. We are asked to find the fold-increase in this minimal flux required to restore activation in the presence of proteases compared to their absence.\n\nThe minimal flux without proteases, $J^{\\ast}_{\\text{no-p}}$, is:\n$$\nJ^{\\ast}_{\\text{no-p}} = n^{\\ast}_{\\text{no-p}}s = \\left(\\frac{k_0 K_d}{s} \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha}\\right)s = k_0 K_d \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha}\n$$\nThe minimal flux with proteases, $J^{\\ast}_{\\text{p}}$, is:\n$$\nJ^{\\ast}_{\\text{p}} = n^{\\ast}_{\\text{p}}s = \\left(\\frac{(k_0 + k_p)K_d}{s} \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha}\\right)s = (k_0 + k_p)K_d \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha}\n$$\nThe fold-increase is the ratio of these two fluxes, $\\frac{J^{\\ast}_{\\text{p}}}{J^{\\ast}_{\\text{no-p}}}$.\n$$\n\\text{Fold-increase} = \\frac{J^{\\ast}_{\\text{p}}}{J^{\\ast}_{\\text{no-p}}} = \\frac{(k_0 + k_p)K_d \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha}}{k_0 K_d \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha}}\n$$\nThe terms $K_d$, $\\alpha$, and $s$ cancel, leaving a simple ratio of the total removal rates:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-increase} = \\frac{k_0 + k_p}{k_0} = 1 + \\frac{k_p}{k_0}\n$$\nThis result shows that the presence of proteases necessitates a proportional increase in the AIP production flux to overcome the additional clearance mechanism and reach the activation threshold. The magnitude of this increase depends only on the relative strengths of the protease-mediated clearance ($k_p$) and the baseline clearance ($k_0$).\n\n**3.
