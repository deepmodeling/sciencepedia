Lacks endosomal receptors.\n*   **System 2 (Endosomal Fraction):** Contains Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR3) and Toll-Like Receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8). Lacks cytosolic sensors.\n*   **Ligand Mixture (added to both systems):**\n    *   **Species S1:** Synthetic blunt-ended double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Length of $150\\,\\mathrm{bp}$. $5'$-triphosphate ($5'$ppp) on both strands. Duplex fraction of $1.0$. Concentration of $0.05\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n    *   **Species S2:** High-molecular-weight long dsRNA. Average length of $3\\,\\mathrm{kb}$. Heterogeneous ends lacking $5'$ppp. Duplex fraction of $1.0$. Concentration of $0.5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n    *   **Species S3:** Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). Length of $8\\,\\mathrm{kb}$. $5'$ cap1 modification. Low uridine content. Predicted duplex fraction of $0.05$. Concentration of $2\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n*   **Foundational Principles:**\n    1.  **Compartmentalization:** RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) are cytosolic; Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) are endosomal.\n    2.  **RIG-I Specificity:** Prefers short, blunt dsRNA with $5'$ppp. Attenuated by $5'$ caps.\n    3.  **MDA5 Specificity:** Binds long, continuous dsRNA via cooperative filament assembly. Does not require $5'$ppp.\n    4.  **TLR3 Specificity:** Recognizes endosomal dsRNA (minimum length of tens of base pairs). Signal strength increases with duplex length.\n    5.  **TLR7/8 Specificity:** Recognizes uridine/guanosine-rich ssRNA fragments in endosomes.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem is analyzed against the validation criteria:\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on well-established principles of innate immunity concerning the function and ligand specificity of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) like RIG-I, MDA5, TLR3, and TLR7/8. The described RNA species are representative of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and are standard reagents in biochemical and immunological studies. The experimental setup of using cell-free extracts is a valid and common technique. The problem is scientifically sound.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined. It presents two distinct systems, each with a specific set of receptors and a common mixture of well-characterized ligands. The question asks for a prediction of the dominant receptor in each system based on the provided principles. This structure allows for a unique, deterministic solution.\n*   **Objective:** The problem statement is objective and quantitative. Ligand properties are defined by precise parameters (length, concentration, end-chemistry, secondary structure). Receptor specificities are described according to established biological consensus. There is no subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is a valid problem that can be solved from first principles. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis must be conducted for each compartment separately to determine the dominant activated receptor.\n\n**Analysis of the Cytosolic Extract (RIG-I and MDA5)**\n\nThe cytosolic extract contains receptors RIG-I and MDA5, and ligands S1, S2, and S3. We must evaluate the interaction of each receptor with the available ligands.\n\n*   **RIG-I Interactions:**\n    *   With S1: Species S1 is a $150\\,\\mathrm{bp}$ dsRNA with a $5'$-triphosphate ($5'$ppp). This is a canonical, high-affinity ligand for RIG-I. The presence of $5'$ppp and a blunt dsRNA structure makes it a potent activator.\n    *   With S2: Species S2 is long dsRNA but critically lacks the $5'$ppp moiety. While RIG-I can bind dsRNA without a triphosphate, its affinity and subsequent activation are significantly reduced.\n    *   With S3: Species S3 is ssRNA with a $5'$ cap. The capping of the $5'$ end is known to inhibit RIG-I binding, effectively marking the RNA as \"self\". RIG-I will not be significantly activated by S3.\n    *   Conclusion for RIG-I: S1 is the only potent ligand for RIG-I in the mixture.\n\n*   **MDA5 Interactions:**\n    *   With S1: Species S1 has a length of $150\\,\\mathrm{bp}$. This is generally considered too short for the efficient cooperative assembly of MDA5 filaments, which is the mechanism for its activation. MDA5 preferentially binds much longer dsRNA.\n    *   With S2: Species S2 is a long ($3\\,\\mathrm{kb}$) dsRNA. This is the canonical ligand for MDA5. MDA5 will readily form long, stable, cooperative filaments on S2, leading to robust signaling. The absence of $5'$ppp is irrelevant for MDA5 activation.\n    *   With S3: Species S3 is predominantly single-stranded (duplex fraction $0.05$). It lacks the long, continuous dsRNA structure required for MDA5 filamentation. MDA5 will not be significantly activated by S3.\n    *   Conclusion for MDA5: S2 is the only potent ligand for MDA5 in the mixture.\n\n*   **Determining the Dominant Receptor in the Cytosol:**\n    The competition is between RIG-I activation by S1 and MDA5 activation by S2.\n    1.  **Specificity:** Both S1 for RIG-I and S2 for MDA5 represent ideal ligand-receptor pairings.\n    2.  **Abundance:** S1 is present at $0.05\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, while S2 is present at $0.5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. There are $10$ times more molecules of the MDA5 ligand (S2) than the RIG-I ligand (S1).\n    3.  **Total Substrate for Activation:** The total length of dsRNA available for receptor binding is a critical factor for signaling output, especially for a filament-forming protein like MDA5.\n        *   Total length from S1 = $(0.05\\,\\mathrm{nM}) \\times (150\\,\\mathrm{bp}) = 7.5\\,\\mathrm{nM \\cdot bp}$.\n        *   Total length from S2 = $(0.5\\,\\mathrm{nM}) \\times (3000\\,\\mathrm{bp}) = 1500\\,\\mathrm{nM \\cdot bp}$.\n    The total amount of dsRNA substrate for MDA5 is $1500 / 7.5 = 200$ times greater than that for RIG-I. Given that MDA5 activation relies on forming extended signaling platforms (filaments) along its ligand, the vast excess of the long S2 substrate will lead to a massively amplified and sustained signal. While RIG-I is potently activated by S1, the total signaling output will be limited by the low concentration of its ligand. Therefore, MDA5 will be the dominant signaling receptor in the cytosol.\n\n**Analysis of the Endosomal Fraction (TLR3 and TLR7/8)**\n\nThe endosomal fraction contains receptors TLR3 and TLR7/8, and ligands S1, S2, and S3.\n\n*   **TLR3 Interactions:**\n    *   Principle: TLR3 recognizes dsRNA. Signal strength increases with ligand length.\n    *   With S1 and S2: Both are pure dsRNA (duplex fraction $1.0$). S1 ($150\\,\\mathrm{bp}$) and S2 ($3\\,\\mathrm{kb}$) are both well above the minimum length requirement for TLR3 activation. According to the stated principle, the much longer S2 will be a significantly more potent activator of TLR3 than S1, likely through multivalent binding and receptor clustering. Given its higher concentration ($0.5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ vs $0.05\\,\\mathrm{nM}$) and much greater length, S2 will be the primary driver of TLR3 signaling.\n    *   With S3: This is predominantly ssRNA and not a ligand for TLR3.\n    *   Conclusion for TLR3: TLR3 will be strongly activated, primarily by S2.\n\n*   **TLR7/8 Interactions:**\n    *   Principle: TLR7/8 recognize U/G-rich ssRNA fragments.\n    *   With S1 and S2: These are dsRNA and not direct ligands for TLR7/8. They would require processing into ssRNA fragments first.\n    *   With S3: This is an ssRNA, the correct structural class of ligand. However, the problem explicitly states that S3 has \"low uridine content\". Since TLR7/8 preferentially sense U-rich (for TLR7) or G-rich (for TLR8) sequences, S3 is a poor ligand.\n    *   Conclusion for TLR7/8: Activation of TLR7/8 will be minimal to negligible due to the absence of a suitable ligand.\n\n*   **Determining the Dominant Receptor in the Endosome:**\n    The competition is between strong TLR3 activation by dsRNA (S1 and especially S2) and very weak TLR7/8 activation by the U-poor ssRNA (S3). The presence of abundant, high-potency dsRNA ligands for TLR3, particularly the long S2 species, ensures that TLR3 signaling will be overwhelmingly dominant.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis:\n*   In the cytosolic extract, **MDA5** is the dominant receptor.\n*   In the endosomal fraction, **TLR3** is the dominant receptor.\n\nThe predicted pairing is Cytosol: MDA5; Endosome: TLR3.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Cytosol: RIG-I; Endosome: TLR3**\n    The prediction for the endosome is correct. However, the prediction for the cytosol is incorrect. While RIG-I is activated by S1, it is outcompeted by MDA5 due to the far greater abundance and length of the MDA5 ligand S2, leading to a dominant MDA5-driven signal. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **B. Cytosol: RIG-I; Endosome: TLR7/8**\n    The prediction for the cytosol is incorrect for the same reason as in option A. The prediction for the endosome is also incorrect, as TLR7/8 have a poor ligand (S3), while TLR3 has an excellent ligand (S2). **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. Cytosol: MDA5; Endosome: TLR3**\n    The prediction for the cytosol (MDA5) is correct, as the abundant, long dsRNA S2 strongly activates MDA5, producing a dominant signal. The prediction for the endosome (TLR3) is also correct, as the same long dsRNA ligand S2 is a potent activator of TLR3, whereas the ligand for TLR7/8 is unsuitable. This option fully matches the derived conclusion. **Correct**.\n\n*   **D. Cytosol: MDA5; Endosome: TLR7/8**\n    The prediction for the cytosol is correct. However, the prediction for the endosome is incorrect. TLR3, not TLR7/8, is the dominant receptor due to the nature of the provided ligands. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2502271"}, {"introduction": "Once a virus is detected and interferons are produced, the cell establishes a powerful antiviral state by expressing hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs).

The untreated viral load at time $T$ is given as:\n$$\nV_{\\text{untreated}}(T) = V_0 \\exp(r T)\n$$\nThe ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathbb{E}[V_{\\text{treated}}(T)]}{V_{\\text{untreated}}(T)} = \\frac{V_0 \\left[ E \\exp(r(1-\\alpha f)T) + (1 - E) \\exp(r T) \\right]}{V_0 \\exp(r T)}\n$$\nThe initial viral load $V_0$ cancels, as it must, since the fractional reduction should not depend on the starting condition:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathbb{E}[V_{\\text{treated}}(T)]}{V_{\\text{untreated}}(T)} = \\frac{E \\exp(rT - r\\alpha f T) + (1 - E) \\exp(r T)}{\\exp(r T)}\n$$\nWe can separate this into two terms:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathbb{E}[V_{\\text{treated}}(T)]}{V_{\\text{untreated}}(T)} = E \\frac{\\exp(rT - r\\alpha f T)}{\\exp(r T)} + (1 - E) \\frac{\\exp(r T)}{\\exp(r T)}\n$$\nUsing the property of exponents $\\exp(a-b) = \\exp(a)/\\exp(b)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathbb{E}[V_{\\text{treated}}(T)]}{V_{\\text{untreated}}(T)} = E \\exp(-r\\alpha f T) + (1 - E)\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this result into the definition of $\\mathcal{R}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = 1 - \\left[ (1 - E) + E \\exp(-r\\alpha f T) \\right]\n$$\nDistributing the negative sign:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = 1 - 1 + E - E \\exp(-r\\alpha f T)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final closed-form expression:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = E - E \\exp(-r\\alpha f T) = E \\left(1 - \\exp(-r\\alpha f T)\\right)\n$$\nThis expression is a function of only the parameters $E$, $f$, $\\alpha$, $r$, and $T$, as required, and is dimensionless.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{E \\left(1 - \\exp(-r \\alpha f T)\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2502259"}]}
