The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information and constraints for a unique solution. It is therefore deemed valid and will be solved as stated.\n\nThe average net charge $Q$ of a polypeptide is the sum of the average charges of all its ionizable groups. For a given ionizable group, its average charge depends on the solution $\\mathrm{pH}$ and its intrinsic acidity constant, $\\mathrm{p}K_a$. The relationship is described by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nThe ionizable groups in the peptide are the C-terminus, which is an acidic group (type $HA \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + A^-$), and the N-terminus and the side chains of lysine, arginine, and histidine, which are basic groups (their conjugate acids are of the type $BH^+ \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + B$).\n\nFor an acidic group, the average charge $q_{\\text{acidic}}$ is given by the fraction of the molecule in its deprotonated (negatively charged) state, multiplied by its charge, $-1$.

This large increase in positive charge is primarily due to the protonation state of the $4$ histidine residues ($\\mathrm{p}K_a=6.0$), which are mostly neutral at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.4$ but become mostly positively charged at $\\mathrm{pH}=5.0$. The primary mechanism of action for cationic AMPs against Gram-negative bacteria is electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged outer membrane, which is rich in lipopolysaccharides (LPS). A higher net positive charge on the AMP results in a stronger electrostatic binding affinity for the bacterial surface. This enhanced accumulation at the membrane is the critical first step that facilitates subsequent membrane disruption and cell death. Therefore, the AMP's antimicrobial activity is expected to **increase** as the environment shifts from the physiological $\\mathrm{pH}$ of $7.4$ to the acidic $\\mathrm{pH}$ of $5.0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.725}\n$$", "id": "2473004"}, {"introduction": "A successful AMP must be potent against pathogens yet safe for the host, a property known as selectivity.

The scenario described is a standard paradigm in antimicrobial peptide design and optimization. The provided values for physiological ionic strength ($I = 150\\,\\mathrm{mM}$), temperature ($T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$), peptide charge (e.g., $+4$ to $+8$), and membrane surface potentials ($\\psi_{\\mathrm{bac}} \\approx -50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\psi_{\\mathrm{RBC}} \\approx -10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) are all within the ranges commonly reported in biophysical and microbiological literature. The underlying physical principle—electrostatic attraction in an electrolyte—is fundamental. The problem is well-posed, providing a specific comparative question based on a clear, albeit simplified, physical model. The assumptions are explicitly stated, rendering the problem self-contained and solvable. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires a prediction based on the role of electrostatic interactions in the initial binding of a cationic peptide to an anionic cell surface. According to the problem's first assumption, this initial electrostatic attraction is the governing factor.\n\nThe free energy of electrostatic interaction, $\\Delta G_{\\text{elec}}$, for bringing a particle of charge $q$ from a region of zero potential (bulk solution, far from the membrane) to a surface with potential $\\psi_{\\text{surface}}$ is given by the fundamental expression:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{elec}} = q \\cdot \\psi_{\\text{surface}} $$\nThe charge of the AMP is $q = Z \\cdot e$, where $Z$ is the net charge number of the peptide and $e$ is the elementary charge. Thus,\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{elec}} = Z \\cdot e \\cdot \\psi_{\\text{surface}} $$\nA more negative $\\Delta G_{\\text{elec}}$ corresponds to a stronger, more favorable attraction. This enhanced attraction leads to a higher effective concentration of the peptide at the membrane surface for a given bulk concentration, which in turn enhances its biological activity. Higher activity means a lower Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) against bacteria and a higher degree of hemolysis of red blood cells (RBCs) at a given peptide concentration.\n\nWe are asked to compare the impact of increasing the AMP charge from $Z_p = +4$ to $Z_v = +8$. The change in peptide charge is $\\Delta Z = Z_v - Z_p = +8 - (+4) = +4$.\n\nLet us calculate the change in the electrostatic free energy of adsorption, $\\Delta(\\Delta G_{\\text{elec}})$, for each cell type. This change is the difference in interaction energy between the variant and parent peptides.\n$$ \\Delta(\\Delta G_{\\text{elec}}) = \\Delta G_{\\text{elec, variant}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{elec, parent}} = (Z_v \\cdot e \\cdot \\psi_{\\text{surface}}) - (Z_p \\cdot e \\cdot \\psi_{\\text{surface}}) = (Z_v - Z_p) \\cdot e \\cdot \\psi_{\\text{surface}} = \\Delta Z \\cdot e \\cdot \\psi_{\\text{surface}} $$\n\nFor the bacterial membrane, with $\\psi_{\\mathrm{bac}} \\approx -50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$:\n$$ \\Delta(\\Delta G_{\\text{elec, bac}}) = (+4) \\cdot e \\cdot (-50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}) $$\nFor the RBC membrane, with $\\psi_{\\mathrm{RBC}} \\approx -10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$:\n$$ \\Delta(\\Delta G_{\\text{elec, RBC}}) = (+4) \\cdot e \\cdot (-10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}) $$\n\nThe magnitude of the change in favorable interaction energy is directly proportional to the magnitude of the surface potential, $|\\psi_{\\text{surface}}|$. Let's compare the magnitudes of these energy changes:\n$$ \\frac{|\\Delta(\\Delta G_{\\text{elec, bac}})|}{|\\Delta(\\Delta G_{\\text{elec, RBC}})|} = \\frac{|(+4) \\cdot e \\cdot (-50\\,\\mathrm{mV})|}{|(+4) \\cdot e \\cdot (-10\\,\\mathrm{mV})|} = \\frac{50}{10} = 5 $$\nThe increase in peptide charge leads to a five-fold greater enhancement of the electrostatic attraction to the bacterial membrane compared to the RBC membrane.\n\nThis disproportionately stronger attraction to bacteria means the peptide's antibacterial potency will be very significantly enhanced, resulting in a large decrease in the MIC. The attraction to RBCs also increases, but to a much lesser extent, leading to a correspondingly smaller increase in hemolytic activity. Therefore, the MIC measurement will be more strongly impacted than the hemolysis measurement.\n\nThe presence of salt ($I = 150\\,\\mathrm{mM}$) leads to electrostatic screening, which is captured by the Debye-Hückel theory. The potential does not remain constant but decays away from the surface, approximately as $\\psi(x) = \\psi_{\\text{surface}} e^{-\\kappa x}$, where $\\kappa^{-1}$ is the Debye length. At $I = 150\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, $\\kappa^{-1}$ is less than $1\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. However, this screening affects both interactions. The fundamental dependence of the interaction energy on the product $Z \\cdot \\psi_{\\text{surface}}$ remains, and our conclusion is robust. The interaction is stronger with the surface that has a higher magnitude of potential.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. The bacterial MIC will decrease much more than hemolysis increases, because doubling the cationic charge disproportionately strengthens attraction to the more anionic bacterial surface relative to the near-neutral RBC membrane under physiological screening.\nThis option correctly states that the MIC will decrease and hemolysis will increase. It correctly identifies that the effect on the bacterial membrane is much stronger (\"disproportionately strengthens attraction\") due to its more negative surface potential ($-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ vs. $-10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$). This aligns perfectly with the derivation. The mention of \"physiological screening\" correctly acknowledges the experimental conditions without making incorrect claims about its consequences.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. Hemolysis will increase more than the MIC decreases, because RBC surfaces are the dominant anionic target and lack sterols that would impede cationic peptide insertion.\nThis option contains two major factual errors based on the problem statement. First, the bacterial surface ($\\psi_{\\mathrm{bac}} \\approx -50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) is far more anionic than the RBC surface ($\\psi_{\\mathrm{RBC}} \\approx -10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$), so bacteria are the dominant anionic target, not RBCs. Second, the problem states that RBCs have \"high cholesterol content\"; cholesterol is a sterol. In contrast, most bacterial membranes lack sterols. The reasoning is flawed and based on false premises.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. MIC and hemolysis will be affected to a similar extent, because electrostatic attraction scales only with peptide charge and not with target surface potential under physiological conditions.\nThe premise of this option is physically incorrect. As shown in the derivation, the electrostatic interaction energy $\\Delta G_{\\text{elec}} = Z e \\psi_{\\text{surface}}$ is a direct product of the peptide charge and the surface potential. It is impossible for the attraction to be independent of the surface potential.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. Neither MIC nor hemolysis will change appreciably, because electrostatic interactions are fully screened at $I = 150\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\nThis is an overstatement. While electrostatic interactions are significantly screened at physiological ionic strength, they are not \"fully\" eliminated. The existence of a non-zero surface potential and the entire mechanism of selectivity for many AMPs depend on these residual, short-range electrostatic fields. If screening were complete, there would be no electrostatic basis for the peptide's function, contradicting the premise of the problem and a large body of experimental evidence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nE. The MIC will increase (worsen) due to enhanced self-association among highly cationic peptides, which outcompetes membrane binding at higher net charge.\nThis option introduces a plausible but external mechanism (peptide self-association) that is not included in the assumptions of the problem. We are explicitly instructed to make a prediction based on the electrostatic attraction to the membrane surface. Within this specified model, increasing cationic charge enhances attraction to an anionic target, which would decrease the MIC, not increase it. This option contradicts the direct consequences of the provided model.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2472952"}, {"introduction": "Moving from biophysical principles to practical drug development requires quantitative measures of a candidate's potential.

It is a straightforward application of pharmacological principles to an in-vitro dataset. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to compute the therapeutic index, $TI$, defined as:\n$$TI = \\frac{C_{\\text{total}, h=0.10}}{C_{\\text{total}, \\text{MIC, serum}}}$$\nwhere $C_{\\text{total}, h=0.10}$ is the total peptide concentration causing $10\\%$ hemolysis, and $C_{\\text{total}, \\text{MIC, serum}}$ is the total peptide concentration corresponding to the MIC in the presence of serum proteins.\n\nFirst, we determine the numerator, $C_{\\text{total}, h=0.10}$.\nThe hemolysis response is governed by the Hill equation. According to principle (i), the concentration driving the effect is the free concentration, $C_{\\text{free}}$. The standard form of the Hill equation for a fractional response $h$ is:\n$$h = \\frac{C_{\\text{free}}^{n}}{C_{50}^{n} + C_{\\text{free}}^{n}}$$\nThe hemolysis assay is conducted in an isotonic buffer, which is a protein-free medium. Therefore, the unbound fraction $f_{u}$ is equal to $1$, and the total concentration is equal to the free concentration: $C_{\\text{total}} = C_{\\text{free}}$.\nWe are given the target hemolysis level $h = 0.10$, the Hill coefficient $n=2$, and the half-maximal lytic concentration $C_{50} = 180 \\ \\mu\\text{M}$. We can substitute these values into the Hill equation to solve for the required concentration, which we denote as $C_{\\text{total}, h=0.10}$.\n$$0.10 = \\frac{(C_{\\text{total}, h=0.10})^{2}}{(180 \\ \\mu\\text{M})^{2} + (C_{\\text{total}, h=0.10})^{2}}$$\nTo solve for $C_{\\text{total}, h=0.10}$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$0.10 \\left( (180 \\ \\mu\\text{M})^{2} + (C_{\\text{total}, h=0.10})^{2} \\right) = (C_{\\text{total}, h=0.10})^{2}$$\n$$0.10 \\cdot (180 \\ \\mu\\text{M})^{2} = (C_{\\text{total}, h=0.10})^{2} - 0.10 \\cdot (C_{\\text{total}, h=0.10})^{2}$$\n$$0.10 \\cdot (180 \\ \\mu\\text{M})^{2} = 0.90 \\cdot (C_{\\text{total}, h=0.10})^{2}$$\n$$(C_{\\text{total}, h=0.10})^{2} = \\frac{0.10}{0.90} (180 \\ \\mu\\text{M})^{2} = \\frac{1}{9} (180 \\ \\mu\\text{M})^{2}$$\nTaking the square root of both sides yields:\n$$C_{\\text{total}, h=0.10} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{9} (180 \\ \\mu\\text{M})^{2}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 180 \\ \\mu\\text{M} = 60 \\ \\mu\\text{M}$$\n\nNext, we determine the denominator, $C_{\\text{total}, \\text{MIC, serum}}$.\nAccording to principle (i), the antibacterial effect is also driven by the free peptide concentration. The MIC in protein-free broth is given as $6 \\ \\mu\\text{M}$. This value represents the required free concentration to inhibit bacterial growth, which we denote as $C_{\\text{free, MIC}}$.\n$$C_{\\text{free, MIC}} = 6 \\ \\mu\\text{M}$$\nThe problem asks for the MIC in a serum-containing medium, which by definition is a total concentration, $C_{\\text{total}, \\text{MIC, serum}}$. To achieve the required free concentration of $C_{\\text{free, MIC}}$ in this medium, the total concentration must be higher due to protein binding. The relationship is given by principle (iii), $C_{\\text{free}} = f_{u} \\, C_{\\text{total}}$, with the unbound fraction in serum given as $f_{u} = 0.25$.\n$$C_{\\text{free, MIC}} = f_{u} \\cdot C_{\\text{total}, \\text{MIC, serum}}$$\nSubstituting the known values and solving for $C_{\\text{total}, \\text{MIC, serum}}$:\n$$6 \\ \\mu\\text{M} = 0.25 \\cdot C_{\\text{total}, \\text{MIC, serum}}$$\n$$C_{\\text{total}, \\text{MIC, serum}} = \\frac{6 \\ \\mu\\text{M}}{0.25} = 24 \\ \\mu\\text{M}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the therapeutic index, $TI$:\n$$TI = \\frac{C_{\\text{total}, h=0.10}}{C_{\\text{total}, \\text{MIC, serum}}} = \\frac{60 \\ \\mu\\text{M}}{24 \\ \\mu\\text{M}} = \\frac{60}{24} = 2.5$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. Thus, $TI = 2.50$.\nThe prioritization threshold is $TI \\geq 10$. Since our calculated value is $2.50$, which is less than $10$, the selectivity margin is not adequate for candidate prioritization. The final answer required is the numerical value of $TI$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.50}$$", "id": "2472997"}]}
