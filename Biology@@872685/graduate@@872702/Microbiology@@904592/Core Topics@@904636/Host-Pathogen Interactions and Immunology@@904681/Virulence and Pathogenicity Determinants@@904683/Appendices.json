In many pathogens, T3SS expression is controlled by a Two-Component System (TCS), in which a membrane-bound sensor kinase detects an extracellular cue and modulates the phosphorylation state of a cytosolic response regulator that binds the T3SS promoter to activate transcription.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Competitive Index Estimator, $\\widehat{CI}$\nThe competitive index ($CI$) compares the relative fitness of the mutant strain to the wild-type strain. It is defined as the ratio of the output ratio to the input ratio.\n\nThe input ratio of mutant to wild-type is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{\\text{mutant count in inoculum}}{\\text{wild-type count in inoculum}}$$\nThe output ratio of mutant to wild-type is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{\\text{mutant count at recovery}}{\\text{wild-type count at recovery}}$$\n\nThe competitive index is therefore:\n$$CI = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{out}}}{R_{\\mathrm{in}}}$$\nLet the true, unobservable mean counts be $\\mu_{M, \\mathrm{in}}, \\mu_{W, \\mathrm{in}}, \\mu_{M, \\mathrm{out}}, \\mu_{W, \\mathrm{out}}$. The true $CI$ is a function of these parameters:\n$$CI = \\frac{\\mu_{M, \\mathrm{out}} / \\mu_{W, \\mathrm{out}}}{\\mu_{M, \\mathrm{in}} / \\mu_{W, \\mathrm{in}}}$$\nThe observed counts, denoted by the random variables $M_{\\mathrm{in}}, W_{\\mathrm{in}}, M_{\\mathrm{out}}, W_{\\mathrm{out}}$, are assumed to be realizations of independent Poisson processes. The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the mean $\\mu$ of a Poisson distribution is the observed count. By the invariance property of MLEs, the MLE of a function of parameters is the same function of the MLEs of those parameters.\nThus, the MLE for the competitive index, $\\widehat{CI}$, is found by substituting the observed counts for their respective true means:\n$$\\widehat{CI} = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{out}} / W_{\\mathrm{out}}}{M_{\\mathrm{in}} / W_{\\mathrm{in}}} = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{out}} \\cdot W_{\\mathrm{in}}}{W_{\\mathrm{out}} \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{in}}}$$\n\nPart 2: Derivation of $\\operatorname{Var}(\\ln \\widehat{CI})$\nTo find the variance of $\\widehat{CI}$, it is standard practice to first work with its natural logarithm, $\\ln \\widehat{CI}$, as its distribution is more symmetric and closer to Normal, especially for small counts.\n$$\\ln \\widehat{CI} = \\ln \\left( \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{out}} \\cdot W_{\\mathrm{in}}}{W_{\\mathrm{out}} \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{in}}} \\right) = \\ln(M_{\\mathrm{out}}) + \\ln(W_{\\mathrm{in}}) - \\ln(W_{\\mathrm{out}}) - \\ln(M_{\\mathrm{in}})$$\nSince the four counts $M_{\\mathrm{in}}, W_{\\mathrm{in}}, M_{\\mathrm{out}}, W_{\\mathrm{out}}$ are assumed to be independent random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances. Note that $\\operatorname{Var}(-X) = (-1)^2 \\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\operatorname{Var}(X)$.\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(\\ln \\widehat{CI}) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\ln M_{\\mathrm{out}}) + \\operatorname{Var}(\\ln W_{\\mathrm{in}}) + \\operatorname{Var}(\\ln W_{\\mathrm{out}}) + \\operatorname{Var}(\\ln M_{\\mathrm{in}})$$\nWe now use the Delta method to approximate the variance of the logarithm of each count. For a random variable $X$ with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$, and for the function $g(X) = \\ln(X)$, the Delta method gives:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(g(X)) \\approx (g'(\\mu))^2 \\sigma^2$$\nHere, $g'(X) = \\frac{1}{X}$, so $g'(\\mu) = \\frac{1}{\\mu}$. For a Poisson variable, $\\sigma^2 = \\mu$. Substituting these into the Delta method formula:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(\\ln X) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu}\\right)^2 \\mu = \\frac{1}{\\mu}$$\nTo get an estimate of this variance from the data, we substitute the observed count $X$ for the unknown mean $\\mu$. Applying this approximation to each of the four independent counts:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(\\ln M_{\\mathrm{out}}) \\approx \\frac{1}{M_{\\mathrm{out}}}, \\quad \\operatorname{Var}(\\ln W_{\\mathrm{in}}) \\approx \\frac{1}{W_{\\mathrm{in}}}, \\quad \\operatorname{Var}(\\ln W_{\\mathrm{out}}) \\approx \\frac{1}{W_{\\mathrm{out}}}, \\quad \\operatorname{Var}(\\ln M_{\\mathrm{in}}) \\approx \\frac{1}{M_{\\mathrm{in}}}$$\nSumming these terms gives the final expression for the approximate variance of $\\ln \\widehat{CI}$:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(\\ln \\widehat{CI}) \\approx \\frac{1}{M_{\\mathrm{in}}} + \\frac{1}{W_{\\mathrm{in}}} + \\frac{1}{M_{\\mathrm{out}}} + \\frac{1}{W_{\\mathrm{out}}}$$\n\nPart 3: Form of the $0.95$ Confidence Interval for $\\ln CI$\nAssuming that $\\ln \\widehat{CI}$ is approximately normally distributed, a two-sided $(1 - \\alpha)$ confidence interval for the true mean $\\ln CI$ is given by:\n$$ \\ln \\widehat{CI} \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\mathrm{SE}(\\ln \\widehat{CI})$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{SE}(\\ln \\widehat{CI}) = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(\\ln \\widehat{CI})}$ is the standard error, and $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the critical value from the standard Normal distribution.

The critical value is $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$.\nSubstituting the expression for the variance, the confidence interval takes the form:\n$$ \\ln \\left( \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{out}} W_{\\mathrm{in}}}{W_{\\mathrm{out}} M_{\\mathrm{in}}} \\right) \\pm z_{0.975} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{M_{\\mathrm{in}}} + \\frac{1}{W_{\\mathrm{in}}} + \\frac{1}{M_{\\mathrm{out}}} + \\frac{1}{W_{\\mathrm{out}}}} $$\n\nCalculation of the Confidence Interval Half-Width\nThe problem asks for the half-width (HW) of the confidence interval, which is the term added to and subtracted from the point estimate.\n$$HW = z_{0.975} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{M_{\\mathrm{in}}} + \\frac{1}{W_{\\mathrm{in}}} + \\frac{1}{M_{\\mathrm{out}}} + \\frac{1}{W_{\\mathrm{out}}}}$$\nWe are given the following data:\n- $M_{\\mathrm{in}} = 6.20 \\times 10^{5}$\n- $W_{\\mathrm{in}} = 7.80 \\times 10^{5}$\n- $M_{\\mathrm{out}} = 120$\n- $W_{\\mathrm{out}} = 960$\nAnd the critical value for $0.95$ confidence is $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$.\n\nFirst, we compute the sum of the reciprocals of the counts:\n$$ \\sum \\frac{1}{N_i} = \\frac{1}{6.20 \\times 10^{5}} + \\frac{1}{7.80 \\times 10^{5}} + \\frac{1}{120} + \\frac{1}{960} $$\n$$ \\sum \\frac{1}{N_i} \\approx (1.6129 \\times 10^{-6}) + (1.2821 \\times 10^{-6}) + 0.00833333 + 0.00104167 $$\nThe terms from the input counts ($M_{\\mathrm{in}}, W_{\\mathrm{in}}$) are negligible compared to the terms from the output counts ($M_{\\mathrm{out}}, W_{\\mathrm{out}}$), which dominate the variance.\n$$ \\sum \\frac{1}{N_i} \\approx 0.000002895 + 0.009375 \\approx 0.0093779 $$\nThe standard error is the square root of this value:\n$$ \\mathrm{SE}(\\ln \\widehat{CI}) = \\sqrt{0.0093779} \\approx 0.0968395 $$\nThe half-width is this standard error multiplied by the critical value $z_{0.975}$:\n$$ HW = 1.96 \\times 0.0968395 \\approx 0.1898054 $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we obtain:\n$$ HW \\approx 0.1898 $$\nThis is the half-width of the $0.95$ confidence interval for $\\ln CI$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1898}$$", "id": "2545665"}, {"introduction": "Molecular Koch's postulates provide a framework for establishing a causal link between a gene and a virulence phenotype.

Your goal is to reason from first principles about when these criteria can be violated by pleiotropy and polar effects, and how to detect such violations inferentially.\n\nFundamental bases you may use:\n- Central Dogma: DNA is transcribed to RNA and translated to protein; protein abundance and activity emerge from transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulation.\n- Bacterial operons: multiple coding sequences can be co-transcribed; mutations in an upstream cistron can reduce transcriptional readthrough and impair downstream translation (polar effects), for example via Rho-dependent termination or loss of translational coupling.\n- Genetic pleiotropy: one gene product can influence multiple cellular traits through direct and indirect network effects; perturbations such as overexpression can induce stress responses not specific to the trait of interest.\n- Molecular Koch’s postulates for virulence determinants: necessity (mutation of the gene reduces virulence) and complementation (specific restoration of the gene rescues virulence to wild-type) are required to infer causality.\n\nThought experiment and data:\n- A deletion allele $\\Delta Y\\!:\\!:\\mathrm{kan}$ removes the coding region of $Y$ and introduces a kanamycin resistance cassette with a transcriptional terminator immediately after the $Y$ start codon. In a mouse model, wild-type bacteria cause host mortality of $80\\%$ by day $7$, whereas $\\Delta Y\\!:\\!:\\mathrm{kan}$ causes $10\\%$ mortality by day $7$. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) shows $Z$ mRNA at $5\\%$ of wild-type in $\\Delta Y\\!:\\!:\\mathrm{kan}$ during infection, while $X$ mRNA is $95\\%$ of wild-type. Plasmid-based trans-complementation expressing only $Y$ from its native promoter in $\\Delta Y\\!:\\!:\\mathrm{kan}$ increases mortality to $30\\%$. In contrast, a bicistronic plasmid expressing $Y$ and $Z$ from the native $YZ$ intergenic region raises mortality to $78\\%$.\n- A scarless, in-frame non-polar deletion $Y^{\\Delta \\mathrm{NP}}$ removes most of the $Y$ coding sequence but preserves the $YZ$ translational coupling signals and introduces a synthetic ribosome-binding site upstream of $Z$. In $Y^{\\Delta \\mathrm{NP}}$, $Z$ mRNA is $90\\%$ of wild-type and mortality is $75\\%$ by day $7$. An active-site mutant $Y^{\\mathrm{K}100\\mathrm{A}}$ integrated at the native locus, with $Z$ mRNA at $100\\%$, yields $70\\%$ mortality.\n- Overexpression of $Y$ from a multicopy plasmid in wild-type reduces exponential-phase growth rate by $20\\%$, upregulates a heat shock regulon reporter by $3$-fold, and reduces mortality from $80\\%$ to $55\\%$.\n\nQuestion: Which option best articulates, using the governing principles above, how pleiotropy and polar effects can violate molecular Koch’s postulates in this scenario, and what inferential strategy allows you to detect and correct for these violations when attributing virulence to $Y$?\n\nA. Conclude that $Y$ is not a direct virulence determinant because the avirulence of $\\Delta Y\\!:\\!:\\mathrm{kan}$ coincides with a severe reduction in downstream $Z$ expression and is rescued only when $Z$ is co-expressed; the near-wild-type virulence of the non-polar $Y^{\\Delta \\mathrm{NP}}$ and of $Y^{\\mathrm{K}100\\mathrm{A}}$ indicates that $Y$’s protein function is not required for virulence under these conditions. The incomplete rescue by $Y$ alone shows failure of the complementation criterion. Pleiotropy is revealed by the global stress and growth penalties upon $Y$ overexpression, which nonspecifically depress virulence. Therefore, infer polarity by qPCR and reporter assays for $Z$, and infer pleiotropy by broad stress signatures and fitness costs, then base causal attribution on non-polar alleles and separation-of-function complementation.\n\nB. Conclude that molecular Koch’s postulates are satisfied because deleting $Y$ reduces virulence and expressing $Y$ in trans partially restores virulence, proving necessity and complementation. Changes in $Z$ expression are downstream consequences and do not undermine causality. Overexpression toxicity strengthens the case that $Y$ is essential for virulence.\n\nC. To avoid polarity, introduce an early nonsense codon in $Y$ so that no $Y$ protein is made. If this nonsense mutant is avirulent, it definitively proves $Y$ is required; downstream changes in $Z$ are irrelevant because translation has ceased upstream.\n\nD. Overexpression of $Y$ causing stress responses and reduced virulence demonstrates $Y$ directly suppresses host immunity; therefore, the avirulence of $\\Delta Y\\!:\\!:\\mathrm{kan}$ reflects loss of this immunosuppressive function. Global transcriptional changes upon overexpression are not informative about pleiotropy.\n\nE.

Demonstrating that a Rho inhibitor restores virulence in $\\Delta Y\\!:\\!:\\mathrm{kan}$ proves polarity is irrelevant to $Y$’s role.", "solution": "The problem statement asks for an articulation of how pleiotropy and polar effects can confound the application of molecular Koch’s postulates, and which inferential strategy correctly identifies and compensates for these issues, based on the provided experimental data. The analysis must proceed from first principles.\n\n**Validation of Problem Statement**\nThe problem statement provides a detailed, hypothetical scenario in molecular microbiology.\n- **Givens:**\n    1.  An operon with genes $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ is transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA.\n    2.  Gene $Y$ is hypothesized to be a virulence determinant.\n    3.  Molecular Koch's postulates are the framework for causal inference (necessity and complementation).\n    4.  Fundamental principles: Central Dogma, bacterial operons (including polar effects), genetic pleiotropy, and the statement of the postulates.\n    5.  Data for the $\\Delta Y\\!:\\!:\\mathrm{kan}$ mutant: Deletion of $Y$ coding region, insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette with a transcriptional terminator. Wild-type (WT) mortality is $80\\%$; $\\Delta Y\\!:\\!:\\mathrm{kan}$ mortality is $10\\%$. In the mutant, $Z$ mRNA is $5\\%$ of WT, and $X$ mRNA is $95\\%$ of WT. Trans-complementation with a plasmid expressing only $Y$ increases mortality to $30\\%$. Trans-complementation with a plasmid expressing both $Y$ and $Z$ increases mortality to $78\\%$.\n    6.  Data for other mutants: A non-polar deletion $Y^{\\Delta \\mathrm{NP}}$ results in $Z$ mRNA at $90\\%$ of WT and $75\\%$ mortality. An active-site mutant $Y^{\\mathrm{K}100\\mathrm{A}}$ results in $Z$ mRNA at $100\\%$ of WT and $70\\%$ mortality.\n    7.  Data for overexpression: Overexpression of $Y$ in WT reduces growth rate by $20\\%$, upregulates a heat shock reporter by $3$-fold, and reduces mortality from $80\\%$ to $55\\%$.\n- **Validation:** The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The experimental designs and data are plausible within the field of molecular genetics and pathogenesis. The concepts of polar effects, non-polar deletions, complementation, and overexpression toxicity are standard. The data provided are sufficient to answer the question, which is to synthesize these observations into a coherent interpretive framework. No flaws are detected. The problem is valid.\n\n**Derivation of Solution from First Principles**\n\nThe analysis must carefully evaluate the criteria of molecular Koch's postulates in light of the confounding effects of polarity and pleiotropy.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Necessity Criterion (Postulate 1):** The first postulate states that inactivating the gene of interest should lead to a loss of virulence.\n    - The $\\Delta Y\\!:\\!:\\mathrm{kan}$ allele causes a dramatic drop in virulence (mortality from $80\\%$ to $10\\%$). A naive interpretation would conclude that gene $Y$ is necessary for virulence.\n    - However, the genetic lesion is not specific to gene $Y$. The description states the resistance cassette contains a transcriptional terminator. This is expected to cause a **polar effect**, terminating transcription before the polymerase reaches downstream genes. The qPCR data confirms this: mRNA for the upstream gene $X$ is unaffected ($95\\%$), while mRNA for the downstream gene $Z$ is severely depleted ($5\\%$).\n    - Therefore, the phenotype of the $\\Delta Y\\!:\\!:\\mathrm{kan}$ strain is a composite of losing gene $Y$ function *and* gene $Z$ function. The avirulence cannot be causally attributed to $Y$ alone.\n    - A proper test of necessity requires a specific, non-polar mutation. The $Y^{\\Delta \\mathrm{NP}}$ allele is such a construct. It removes gene $Y$ but is designed to preserve downstream expression, which is confirmed by $Z$ mRNA levels being at $90\\%$ of wild-type. This strain exhibits $75\\%$ mortality, nearly identical to the wild-type's $80\\%$.\n    - Further, the active-site mutant $Y^{\\mathrm{K}100\\mathrm{A}}$, which produces a non-functional Y protein but does not affect the operon structure ($Z$ mRNA is $100\\%$), also shows high virulence ($70\\%$ mortality).\n    - **Conclusion on Necessity:** The severe virulence defect of the polar mutant is primarily due to the loss of $Z$ expression, not the loss of $Y$. Gene $Y$ itself is largely dispensable for virulence under these conditions. The necessity criterion, when tested naively, gives a false positive.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Complementation Criterion (Postulate 2):** The second postulate states that reintroducing the specific gene into the mutant strain should restore virulence to wild-type levels.\n    - Complementation is performed in the $\\Delta Y\\!:\\!:\\mathrm{kan}$ background, which lacks both $Y$ and $Z$ expression.\n    - Providing a plasmid expressing only gene $Y$ results in a mortality of $30\\%$. This is a very poor rescue compared to the wild-type level of $80\\%$. Thus, the complementation criterion for gene $Y$ **fails**.\n    - In contrast, providing a plasmid expressing both $Y$ and $Z$ restores mortality to $78\\%$, which is a near-complete rescue.\n    - **Conclusion on Complementation:** The success of the $Y-Z$ bicistronic complementation, contrasted with the failure of the $Y$-only complementation, is definitive evidence that the virulence defect of the $\\Delta Y\\!:\\!:\\mathrm{kan}$ polar mutant was primarily attributable to the loss of gene $Z$.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Pleiotropy and Overexpression Artifacts:**\n    - The experiment involving overexpression of $Y$ from a multicopy plasmid reveals several artifacts. It causes a growth defect ($-20\\%$), induces a general stress response (heat shock regulon up $3$-fold), and paradoxically *reduces* virulence (mortality drops from $80\\%$ to $55\\%$).\n    - These are hallmarks of protein overexpression toxicity, a form of **pleiotropy** where a perturbation (high protein level) has broad, non-specific effects on cell physiology. The resulting phenotype (reduced virulence) is not informative about the gene's specific function at physiological levels; rather, it reflects a general fitness cost. This demonstrates how misinterpretation of data from non-physiological expression levels can confound causal inference.\n\n4.  **Inferential Strategy Summary:**\n    - To properly attribute gene function in an operon, one must anticipate and test for polar effects. This is done by measuring the expression of downstream genes (e.g., via qPCR).\n    - Causal attribution of function to a specific gene requires the use of non-polar mutations (e.g., scarless in-frame deletions) or specific functional point mutations (e.g., active-site mutants).\n    - Complementation experiments must account for all defects in the mutant background. If a mutation is polar, successful complementation may require co-expression of the affected downstream genes. Comparing single-gene vs. multi-gene complementation is a powerful diagnostic tool.\n    - Overexpression studies must be interpreted with caution, as they can reveal non-specific pleiotropic effects or toxicity that are not reflective of the gene's native function.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n-   **A. Conclude that $Y$ is not a direct virulence determinant because the avirulence of $\\Delta Y\\!:\\!:\\mathrm{kan}$ coincides with a severe reduction in downstream $Z$ expression and is rescued only when $Z$ is co-expressed; the near-wild-type virulence of the non-polar $Y^{\\Delta \\mathrm{NP}}$ and of $Y^{\\mathrm{K}100\\mathrm{A}}$ indicates that $Y$’s protein function is not required for virulence under these conditions. The incomplete rescue by $Y$ alone shows failure of the complementation criterion. Pleiotropy is revealed by the global stress and growth penalties upon $Y$ overexpression, which nonspecifically depress virulence. Therefore, infer polarity by qPCR and reporter assays for $Z$, and infer pleiotropy by broad stress signatures and fitness costs, then base causal attribution on non-polar alleles and separation-of-function complementation.**\n    This option correctly synthesizes all pieces of evidence. It correctly identifies the polar effect on $Z$ as the cause of the phenotype in the $\\Delta Y\\!:\\!:\\mathrm{kan}$ mutant, correctly interprets the results from the non-polar and active-site mutants, correctly analyzes the failure and success of the different complementation strategies, and correctly identifies the overexpression phenotype as a pleiotropic artifact. The proposed inferential strategy is the scientifically rigorous approach.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **B. Conclude that molecular Koch’s postulates are satisfied because deleting $Y$ reduces virulence and expressing $Y$ in trans partially restores virulence, proving necessity and complementation. Changes in $Z$ expression are downstream consequences and do not undermine causality. Overexpression toxicity strengthens the case that $Y$ is essential for virulence.**\n    This option is deeply flawed. It incorrectly asserts that the postulates are satisfied when the complementation criterion clearly fails (partial rescue is not a rescue to wild-type levels). It makes the critical error of dismissing the change in $Z$ expression as irrelevant, when it is the central confounding variable. The claim that overexpression toxicity \"strengthens the case\" is illogical; a phenomenon that reduces virulence cannot prove a gene is essential for virulence.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. To avoid polarity, introduce an early nonsense codon in $Y$ so that no $Y$ protein is made. If this nonsense mutant is avirulent, it definitively proves $Y$ is required; downstream changes in $Z$ are irrelevant because translation has ceased upstream.**\n    This option proposes a flawed experimental design. Introducing a nonsense (stop) codon is a classic method for *creating*, not avoiding, polar mutations due to effects like transcriptional polarity (Rho-dependent termination). The assertion that downstream changes are irrelevant is the opposite of the known mechanism of polarity.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. Overexpression of $Y$ causing stress responses and reduced virulence demonstrates $Y$ directly suppresses host immunity; therefore, the avirulence of $\\Delta Y\\!:\\!:\\mathrm{kan}$ reflects loss of this immunosuppressive function. Global transcriptional changes upon overexpression are not informative about pleiotropy.**\n    This option involves a speculative leap of logic. Reduced virulence upon overexpression is much more parsimoniously explained by general pathogen sickness (toxicity) than a specific, and paradoxical, \"immunosuppressive\" function. The claim that global transcriptional changes are \"not informative about pleiotropy\" is false; activation of a heat shock regulon is a canonical indicator of a pleiotropic stress response.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **E. Drive $Y$ from a strong non-native promoter at a neutral chromosomal site and show rescue of virulence; this definitively satisfies complementation because higher $Y$ dosage cannot confound if virulence increases. Demonstrating that a Rho inhibitor restores virulence in $\\Delta Y\\!:\\!:\\mathrm{kan}$ proves polarity is irrelevant to $Y$’s role.**\n    This option is incorrect on multiple fronts. First, using a strong promoter is likely to recreate the overexpression toxicity that reduced virulence. Second, complementing the polar mutant (lacking $Z$) with only $Y$ will fail, regardless of dosage. Third, the interpretation of the Rho inhibitor experiment is inverted. If a Rho inhibitor restores virulence, it *proves* that the original phenotype was due to Rho-dependent polarity, making polarity highly relevant.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2545630"}]}
