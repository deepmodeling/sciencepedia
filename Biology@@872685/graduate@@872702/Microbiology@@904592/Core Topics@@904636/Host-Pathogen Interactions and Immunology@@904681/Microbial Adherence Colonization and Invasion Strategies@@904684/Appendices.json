From this kinetic equation, dimensional analysis shows that the units of $k_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{2D}}$ must be $\\text{s}^{-1}$. At equilibrium, the thermodynamic dissociation constant is defined by the ratio of mass-action concentrations, $K_{d}^{\\text{2D}} = \\frac{\\sigma_L \\sigma_R}{\\sigma_b}$, which equals the ratio of the kinetic rate constants, $K_{d}^{\\text{2D}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{2D}}}{k_{\\text{on}}^{\\text{2D}}}$. The units of this quantity must therefore be $\\frac{\\text{s}^{-1}}{\\mu\\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = \\mu\\text{m}^{-2}$. This is in direct contradiction with the units of $\\mu\\text{m}^{2}$ provided for $K_{d}^{\\text{2D}}$ in the problem statement.\n\nConversely, the two-dimensional association constant is defined as $K_{a}^{\\text{2D}} = \\frac{1}{K_{d}^{\\text{2D}}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}}^{\\text{2D}}}{k_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{2D}}}$.

This indicates a terminological error in the problem statement, a common but regrettable mistake in the relevant literature. We must proceed by interpreting the given constant as the two-dimensional association constant, $K_{a}^{\\text{2D}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{2}$. Without this critical correction, the problem is dimensionally inconsistent and thus invalid.\n\nWith this correction, we derive the probability $P$ from first principles.

We must ascertain if simplifications are justified. We first compute the dissociation rate constants $k_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{2D}}$ using the relation $k_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{2D}} = k_{\\text{on}}^{\\text{2D}} / K_{a}^{\\text{2D}}$.\nFor variant $X$: $k_{\\text{off},X}^{\\text{2D}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{2}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\nFor variant $Y$: $k_{\\text{off},Y}^{\\text{2D}} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{2}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\nThe characteristic lifetimes of the bonds are $\\tau_{bond,X} = 1/k_{\\text{off},X}^{\\text{2D}} = 1000\\,\\text{s}$ and $\\tau_{bond,Y} = 1/k_{\\text{off},Y}^{\\text{2D}} = 200\\,\\text{s}$. Since both lifetimes are substantially larger than the contact time $\\tau_c = 0.10\\,\\text{s}$, any bonds formed are highly unlikely to dissociate. We can therefore neglect the dissociation term, $-k_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{2D}} \\sigma_b$, for the duration of the contact.\n\nThe kinetic equation simplifies to $\\frac{d\\sigma_b}{dt} \\approx k_{\\text{on}}^{\\text{2D}} (\\sigma_L - \\sigma_b)(\\sigma_R - \\sigma_b)$.

Thus, we can approximate the concentrations of free ligands and receptors by their total concentrations, $(\\sigma_L - \\sigma_b) \\approx \\sigma_L$ and $(\\sigma_R - \\sigma_b) \\approx \\sigma_R$. The validity of this assumption will be checked post-derivation. The rate equation further simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma_b}{dt} \\approx k_{\\text{on}}^{\\text{2D}} \\sigma_L \\sigma_R\n$$\nThis indicates a constant rate of bond formation per unit area. The total rate of bond formation, $R_{form}$, across the entire contact area $A_c$ is:\n$$\nR_{form} = A_c \\left( \\frac{d\\sigma_b}{dt} \\right) \\approx A_c k_{\\text{on}}^{\\text{2D}} \\sigma_L \\sigma_R\n$$\nBond formation, being a stochastic process with a constant average rate, can be modeled by a Poisson distribution, as suggested by the problem. The mean number of bonds formed during the time interval $\\tau_c$, denoted by $\\lambda$, is the product of the rate and the time:\n$$\n\\lambda = R_{form} \\times \\tau_c = A_c \\tau_c k_{\\text{on}}^{\\text{2D}} \\sigma_L \\sigma_R\n$$\nThe probability of observing exactly $k$ bonds is given by the Poisson probability mass function $P(N_b=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}$. We require the probability of at least one bond, $P(N_b \\ge 1)$, which is complementary to the probability of zero bonds, $P(N_b=0)$.\n$$\nP = P(N_b \\ge 1) = 1 - P(N_b=0)\n$$\nFrom the Poisson formula, $P(N_b=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 e^{-\\lambda}}{0!} = e^{-\\lambda}$.
