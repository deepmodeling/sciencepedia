This first exercise guides you through deriving this critical value, the minimal immune fraction $H^*$, from the foundational relationship between the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, and the effective reproduction number, $R_e$. Beyond the derivation, this practice delves into the practical realities of epidemiology by examining how uncertainty in estimates of $R_0$ propagates to our target for $H^*$, a crucial consideration for robust public health planning. [@problem_id:2543678]", "problem": "In a large, homogeneously mixing host population governed by the Susceptible–Infectious–Removed (SIR) framework, the basic reproduction number $R_{0}$ is defined as the expected number of secondary infections generated by a single typical infectious individual in a wholly susceptible population. Let $H \\in [0,1]$ denote the immune fraction (for example, immune due to sterilizing vaccination or prior infection), so that the susceptible fraction is $S = 1 - H$. It is a well-tested fact that at the start of an epidemic, when depletion of susceptibles by infection is negligible, the effective reproduction number satisfies $R_{\\mathrm{e}} = R_{0} S$. Sustained transmission requires $R_{\\mathrm{e}}  1$, and prevention of sustained transmission requires $R_{\\mathrm{e}}  1$.\n\nStarting from these foundational facts, derive the minimal immune fraction $H^{*}$ that just prevents sustained transmission (that is, the threshold at which $R_{\\mathrm{e}} = 1$). Then, treat $H^{*}$ as an explicit function of $R_{0}$ and, using a first-order Taylor (delta-method) approximation, obtain the leading-order linear uncertainty propagation from uncertainty in $R_{0}$ to uncertainty in $H^{*}$; that is, if the standard deviation of $R_{0}$ is $\\sigma_{R_{0}}$, define the sensitivity coefficient $c$ by $\\sigma_{H^{*}} \\approx c\\,\\sigma_{R_{0}}$ and express $c$ in terms of $R_{0}$.\n\nFinally, evaluate both quantities at $R_{0} = 3.5$.

The value for $c$ must be an exact expression.\n\nThe problem is validated against the mandatory criteria.\n*   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is built upon the foundational principles of mathematical epidemiology, specifically the SIR model and the concept of the herd immunity threshold. The relation $R_{\\mathrm{e}} = R_{0} S$ is a cornerstone of this field. Thus, the problem is scientifically sound.\n*   **Well-Posedness**: The objectives are clearly stated and mathematically derivable from the provided premises. The questions ask for specific quantities ($H^{*}$ and $c$) for which unique solutions exist.\n*   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid as it does not exhibit any of the enumerated flaws. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The solution proceeds.\n\nThe first objective is to derive the minimal immune fraction, denoted $H^{*}$, required to prevent sustained transmission. The threshold for preventing sustained transmission is the point at which the effective reproduction number, $R_{\\mathrm{e}}$, is equal to $1$. At this threshold, each infectious individual produces, on average, one new infection, so the epidemic does not grow.\n\nWe are given the relation:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{e}} = R_{0} S$$\nWe are also given that the susceptible fraction $S$ is related to the immune fraction $H$ by:\n$$S = 1 - H$$\nSubstituting the expression for $S$ into the equation for $R_{\\mathrm{e}}$ yields:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{e}} = R_{0} (1 - H)$$\nTo find the herd immunity threshold $H^{*}$, we set $R_{\\mathrm{e}} = 1$:\n$$1 = R_{0} (1 - H^{*})$$\nWe now solve for $H^{*}$ as a function of $R_{0}$. This is under the assumption that $R_{0}  1$, which is the necessary condition for an epidemic to be possible in the first place. If $R_{0} \\le 1$, no epidemic can occur even in a fully susceptible population, and the required immune fraction is $0$. Given the context and the value $R_{0} = 3.5$, the assumption $R_{0}  1$ is valid.\n$$\\frac{1}{R_{0}} = 1 - H^{*}$$\n$$H^{*} = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_{0}}$$\nThis expression gives the minimal immune fraction needed to achieve herd immunity.\n\nThe second objective is to determine the sensitivity coefficient $c$ that relates the uncertainty in $H^{*}$ to the uncertainty in $R_{0}$. This is achieved using a first-order Taylor series approximation, also known as the delta method. For a function $H^{*}(R_{0})$, the uncertainty propagation is given by:\n$$\\sigma_{H^{*}} \\approx \\left| \\frac{dH^{*}}{dR_{0}} \\right| \\sigma_{R_{0}}$$\nThe problem defines the sensitivity coefficient $c$ as the factor in this approximation:\n$$c = \\left| \\frac{dH^{*}}{dR_{0}} \\right|$$\nWe must compute the derivative of $H^{*}(R_{0}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_{0}} = 1 - R_{0}^{-1}$ with respect to $R_{0}$:\n$$\\frac{dH^{*}}{dR_{0}} = \\frac{d}{dR_{0}} \\left( 1 - R_{0}^{-1} \\right) = 0 - (-1)R_{0}^{-2} = \\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}$$\nSince $R_{0}^{2}$ is always positive for $R_{0}  1$, the derivative is positive, and the absolute value is redundant. Therefore, the sensitivity coefficient is:\n$$c = \\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate both $H^{*}$ and $c$ for the given value $R_{0} = 3.5$.\n\nFor the minimal immune fraction $H^{*}$:\n$$H^{*} = 1 - \\frac{1}{3.5} = 1 - \\frac{1}{7/2} = 1 - \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{5}{7}$$\nThe problem requires this result as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\frac{5}{7} \\approx 0.7142857...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$H^{*} \\approx 0.7143$$\n\nFor the sensitivity coefficient $c$:\n$$c = \\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}} = \\frac{1}{(3.5)^{2}}$$\nThe problem requires an exact expression for this value.\n$$(3.5)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{49}{4} = 12.25$$\nTherefore,\n$$c = \\frac{1}{49/4} = \\frac{4}{49}$$\n\nThe final answer is to be reported as a two-entry row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} H^{*}  c \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe two calculated values are $H^{*} \\approx 0.7143$ and $c = \\frac{4}{49}$.\nThe matrix is thus $\\begin{pmatrix} 0.7143  \\frac{4}{49} \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.7143  \\frac{4}{49} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2543678"}, {"introduction": "While the herd immunity threshold provides a target, its achievability depends critically on how a vaccine functions.

There are no internal contradictions, factual errors, or unrealistic premises. The models of vaccine action are standard idealizations. The question is a straightforward application of fundamental principles and does not contain ambiguity or triviality.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe fundamental principle for a homogeneously mixed population is that the effective reproduction number, $R_{\\text{eff}}$, is the product of the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, and the average susceptibility of the population, here denoted $s_{\\text{avg}}$.\n$$R_{\\text{eff}} = R_0 \\cdot s_{\\text{avg}}$$\n$R_0$ is defined in a fully susceptible population, where $s_{\\text{avg}}=1$. Vaccination reduces the average susceptibility. We must calculate this reduction for each model.\n\n**Analysis of the All-or-None Model**\nIn the all-or-none model, the population is partitioned. A fraction $1-c$ is unvaccinated and has susceptibility $1$. A fraction $c$ is vaccinated. Within this vaccinated group, a fraction $\\text{VE}_S$ is fully protected (susceptibility $0$) and a fraction $1-\\text{VE}_S$ is not protected (susceptibility $1$).\nThe average susceptibility of the population, $s_{\\text{avg, AoN}}$, is the weighted average over these sub-populations:\n$$s_{\\text{avg, AoN}}(c) = (1-c) \\cdot 1 + c \\cdot \\left[ (1-\\text{VE}_S) \\cdot 1 + \\text{VE}_S \\cdot 0 \\right]$$\n$$s_{\\text{avg, AoN}}(c) = 1-c + c(1-\\text{VE}_S) = 1-c+c-c \\cdot \\text{VE}_S$$\n$$s_{\\text{avg, AoN}}(c) = 1 - c \\cdot \\text{VE}_S$$\nThe effective reproduction number for the all-or-none model is therefore:\n$$R_{\\text{eff}, \\text{AoN}}(c) = R_0 (1 - c \\cdot \\text{VE}_S)$$\nThe herd-immunity threshold, $c^{\\ast}$, is the minimum coverage $c$ for which $R_{\\text{eff}, \\text{AoN}}(c) \\leq 1$. We solve for the boundary case $R_{\\text{eff}, \\text{AoN}}(c^{\\ast}) = 1$:\n$$R_0 (1 - c^{\\ast} \\cdot \\text{VE}_S) = 1$$\n$$1 - c^{\\ast} \\cdot \\text{VE}_S = \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n$$c^{\\ast} \\cdot \\text{VE}_S = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n$$c^{\\ast} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}}{\\text{VE}_S}$$\nSubstituting the given values $R_0 = 5$ and $\\text{VE}_S = 0.8$:\n$$c^{\\ast} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{5}}{0.8} = \\frac{1 - 0.2}{0.8} = \\frac{0.8}{0.8} = 1$$\nThus, for the all-or-none model, the required coverage to achieve herd immunity is $c^{\\ast} = 1.0$.\n\n**Analysis of the Leaky Model**\nIn the leaky model, a fraction $1-c$ of the population is unvaccinated (susceptibility $1$). The entire fraction $c$ of vaccinated individuals has their susceptibility reduced to $1-\\text{VE}_S$.\nThe average susceptibility of the population, $s_{\\text{avg, Leaky}}$, is:\n$$s_{\\text{avg, Leaky}}(c) = (1-c) \\cdot 1 + c \\cdot (1-\\text{VE}_S)$$\n$$s_{\\text{avg, Leaky}}(c) = 1-c + c - c \\cdot \\text{VE}_S = 1 - c \\cdot \\text{VE}_S$$\nFor the purpose of calculating the population-level average susceptibility, the two models are equivalent. The effective reproduction number for the leaky model is:\n$$R_{\\text{eff}, \\text{Leaky}}(c) = R_0 (1 - c \\cdot \\text{VE}_S)$$\nThe problem asks whether there exists a coverage $c \\in [0, 1)$ such that $R_{\\text{eff}, \\text{Leaky}}(c) \\leq 1$. We must solve the inequality:\n$$R_0 (1 - c \\cdot \\text{VE}_S) \\leq 1$$\nSubstituting the parameter values:\n$$5 (1 - c \\cdot 0.8) \\leq 1$$\n$$1 - 0.8c \\leq \\frac{1}{5}$$\n$$1 - 0.8c \\leq 0.2$$\n$$0.8 \\leq 0.8c$$\n$$c \\geq 1$$\nThis inequality requires that the vaccination coverage $c$ must be greater than or equal to $1$. The only value of $c$ in the allowed domain $c \\in [0,1]$ that satisfies this condition is $c=1$. There exists no value of $c$ in the interval $[0,1)$ that suffices to bring the effective reproduction number to $1$ or below.\nThis critical case arises because the parameters are chosen such that $R_0(1-\\text{VE}_S) = 5(1-0.8) = 5(0.2) = 1$. This means that even if the entire population is vaccinated ($c=1$), each infected individual still produces, on average, one new infection, and the epidemic can persist. To achieve epidemic control ($R_{\\text{eff}}  1$), one would require a vaccine with higher efficacy or a pathogen with lower transmissibility, such that $R_0(1-\\text{VE}_S)  1$.\nSince no $c  1$ exists that satisfies the condition, the indicator variable $I$ is $0$.\n\nThe final requested quantities are $c^{\\ast} = 1.0$ and $I=0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1.0  0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2543611"}, {"introduction": "Real-world vaccines often confer complex protection, simultaneously reducing susceptibility to infection and the infectiousness of individuals who experience breakthrough infections.

This assumes a standard incidence formulation where the rate of new infections from $I$ infectious individuals into a population of $S$ susceptibles is $\\beta (S/N) I$.\n\nThe next-generation method requires us to define the rates of new infections in each group. Let $\\mathcal{F}_i$ be the rate of new infections in group $i$.\nThe rate of new infections in the unvaccinated group ($\\mathcal{F}_1$) arises from contact with infectious individuals from the unvaccinated group ($I_1$) and the vaccinated group ($I_2$).
