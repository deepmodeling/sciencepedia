We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^{\\circ'}$, for the oxidation of nitrite ($\\text{NO}_2^{-}$) to nitrate ($\\text{NO}_3^{-}$) by a chemolithoautotrophic bacterium using oxygen ($\\text{O}_2$) as the terminal electron acceptor. The process occurs under standard biochemical conditions, which are defined as a temperature of $25\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ and a $\\text{pH}$ of $7$.\n\nThe overall reaction is composed of two half-reactions: the oxidation of the electron donor ($\\text{NO}_2^{-}$) and the reduction of the electron acceptor ($\\text{O}_2$).\n\nFirst, we write the oxidation half-reaction for the nitrite/nitrate couple. The oxidation state of nitrogen in $\\text{NO}_2^{-}$ is $+3$, and in $\\text{NO}_3^{-}$ it is $+5$. This is a loss of two electrons.\nThe balanced half-reaction is:\n$$ \\text{NO}_2^{-} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{NO}_3^{-} + 2\\text{H}^{+} + 2e^{-} $$\nThe standard reduction potential for the electron donor couple is given as $E^\\circ{}'_{\\text{NO}_3^{-}/\\text{NO}_2^{-}} = +0.43\\ \\text{V}$.\n\nSecond, we write the reduction half-reaction for the oxygen/water couple. The oxidation state of oxygen in $\\text{O}_2$ is $0$, and in $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ it is $-2$. Each oxygen atom gains two electrons, so a molecule of $\\text{O}_2$ gains four electrons.\nThe balanced half-reaction is:\n$$ \\text{O}_2 + 4\\text{H}^{+} + 4e^{-} \\rightarrow 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} $$\nThe standard reduction potential for the electron acceptor couple is given as $E^\\circ{}'_{\\text{O}_2/\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} = +0.82\\ \\text{V}$.\n\nTo obtain the balanced overall reaction, we must balance the number of electrons transferred.
