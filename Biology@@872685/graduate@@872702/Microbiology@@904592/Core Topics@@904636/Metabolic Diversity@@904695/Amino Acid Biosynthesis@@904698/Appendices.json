The provided stoichiometries are standard representations of the GS-GOGAT and GDH reactions. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to calculate a unique, meaningful answer. The language is objective and precise. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n**Step 3: Solution Derivation**\n\nWe will now derive the net costs for each pathway by performing stoichiometric analysis. The goal is to determine the net reaction for the synthesis of $1$ mole of L-glutamate from a carbon skeleton ($2$-oxoglutarate) and a nitrogen source (ammonia/ammonium).\n\n**Analysis of the GS-GOGAT Route**\n\nThis pathway involves two sequential reactions. The first reaction \"activates\" ammonia by incorporating it into L-glutamine at the cost of ATP. The second reaction transfers this activated amino group to a carbon skeleton to generate two molecules of L-glutamate, one of which replaces the L-glutamate consumed in the first step.\n\nThe given reactions are:\n$$\n(1) \\quad \\text{L-glutamate} + \\text{ammonia} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{L-glutamine} + \\text{ADP} + \\text{Pi}\n$$\n$$\n(2) \\quad 2\\text{-oxoglutarate} + \\text{L-glutamine} + \\text{NADPH} + \\mathrm{H}^{+} \\rightarrow 2 \\text{ L-glutamate} + \\text{NADP}^{+}\n$$\n\nTo find the net reaction for the cycle, we sum reaction $(1)$ and reaction $(2)$. The intermediate species, $\\text{L-glutamine}$, appears as a product in $(1)$ and a reactant in $(2)$, and thus cancels out.\n\nSum:\n$(\\text{L-glutamate} + \\text{ammonia} + \\text{ATP}) + (2\\text{-oxoglutarate} + \\text{L-glutamine} + \\text{NADPH} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}) \\rightarrow (\\text{L-glutamine} + \\text{ADP} + \\text{Pi}) + (2 \\text{ L-glutamate} + \\text{NADP}^{+})$\n\nWe cancel common species on opposite sides of the reaction arrow.\n- $1$ molecule of L-glutamine cancels.\n- $1$ molecule of L-glutamate on the reactant side cancels with $1$ of the $2$ molecules on the product side, leaving a net production of $1$ molecule of L-glutamate.\n\nThe resulting net reaction for the incorporation of $1$ mole of ammonia is:\n$$\n\\text{Net GS-GOGAT: } 2\\text{-oxoglutarate} + \\text{ammonia} + \\text{ATP} + \\text{NADPH} + \\mathrm{H}^{+} \\rightarrow \\text{L-glutamate} + \\text{ADP} + \\text{Pi} + \\text{NADP}^{+}\n$$\n\nFrom this net stoichiometry, the costs per mole of ammonia incorporated are:\n- ATP cost, $a$: $1$ mole of ATP is hydrolyzed. Thus, $a = 1$.\n- NADPH cost, $b$: $1$ mole of NADPH is oxidized. Thus, $b = 1$.\n\n**Analysis of the GDH Route**\n\nThis pathway involves a single, direct reductive amination of $2$-oxoglutarate. The reaction as provided is:\n$$\n\\text{GDH: } 2\\text{-oxoglutarate} + \\text{ammonium} + \\text{NADPH} + \\mathrm{H}^{+} \\rightarrow \\text{L-glutamate} + \\text{NADP}^{+}\n$$\nThis reaction directly achieves the synthesis of $1$ mole of L-glutamate from $1$ mole of ammonium (the ionized form of ammonia at physiological pH) and $1$ mole of $2$-oxoglutarate.\n\nWe inspect the reaction to determine the costs:\n- ATP cost, $c$: ATP is not a participant in this reaction. Therefore, the ATP cost is $0$. Thus, $c = 0$.\n- NADPH cost, $d$: $1$ mole of NADPH is oxidized to produce $1$ mole of L-glutamate. Thus, $d = 1$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated stoichiometric costs are:\n- For the GS-GOGAT route: $a = 1$ mol ATP / mol ammonia, $b = 1$ mol NADPH / mol ammonia.\n- For the GDH route: $c = 0$ mol ATP / mol ammonia, $d = 1$ mol NADPH / mol ammonia.\n\nThe requested result is the row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c & d \\end{pmatrix}$.

[@problem_id:2469646]", "problem": "An aerobic bacterium encodes two routes for assimilating inorganic nitrogen into L-glutamate: the Glutamine Synthetase–Glutamate Synthase pathway (GS–GOGAT) and Glutamate Dehydrogenase (GDH). In this organism, Glutamine Synthetase (GS) couples ammonia incorporation into L-glutamine to the hydrolysis of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), and Glutamate Synthase (GOGAT) subsequently transfers the amide nitrogen to $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate to form L-glutamate using Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH) as reductant. Glutamate Dehydrogenase (GDH) catalyzes the reductive amination of $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate with $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$ using NADPH, without consuming ATP. The p$K_a$ of the $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}/\\mathrm{NH_3}$ couple is $9.25$, and intracellular $pH$ is $7.5$. Under nitrogen limitation, GS is largely unadenylylated; under nitrogen excess, GS is extensively adenylylated, which decreases its catalytic capacity.\n\nTo interrogate how thermodynamic driving forces, acid–base speciation, enzyme kinetics, and regulation jointly determine pathway usage, consider the following empirically determined parameters at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$:\n\n- For GDH: $K_m(\\mathrm{NH_4^+}) = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{mM}$; $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{GDH}} = 100$ (arbitrary flux units under saturating $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate and NADPH).\n- For GS: $K_m(\\mathrm{NH_3}) = 0.010\\,\\mathrm{mM}$; $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{GS}} = 100$ when unadenylylated; extensive adenylylation reduces $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{GS}}$ by a factor of $5$.\n- GOGAT is not rate limiting under the conditions tested and uses NADPH in this organism.\n- Standard transformed Gibbs free energy change for ATP hydrolysis is approximately $-30.5\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ under biochemical standard conditions; the GDH reductive amination reaction is near thermodynamic equilibrium under typical intracellular metabolite levels.\n\nAssume two regimes of total intracellular ammonia, defined as $[\\text{NH}_x] \\equiv [\\text{NH}_3] + [\\text{NH}_4^+]$: a low-nitrogen regime with $[\\text{NH}_x] = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and a high-nitrogen regime with $[\\text{NH}_x] = 10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$. The concentrations of $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate and NADPH are sufficiently high to avoid saturation differences between the pathways, and other substrates or products are not limiting.\n\nWhich option best explains, from thermodynamic and kinetic principles together with cofactor usage and regulatory logic, why cells favor GS–GOGAT at low $[\\text{NH}_x]$ but switch to GDH at high $[\\text{NH}_x]$?\n\nA. At low $[\\text{NH}_x]$, only a small fraction is present as $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ at $pH\\,7.5$, but the low $K_m(\\mathrm{NH_3})$ of GS and ATP coupling make ammonia incorporation kinetically efficient and thermodynamically favorable; GOGAT then uses NADPH to complete assimilation. Under nitrogen limitation, low L-glutamine and high $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate lead to deadenylylation of GS, maximizing $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{GS}}$, while GDH is kinetically disfavored by its high $K_m(\\mathrm{NH_4^+})$ and is transcriptionally downregulated. At high $[\\text{NH}_x]$, $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$ abundance overcomes GDH’s high $K_m$, allowing high flux without ATP expenditure, while elevated L-glutamine triggers GS adenylylation, reducing its capacity; thus, GDH dominates due to both kinetics and energy economy.\n\nB. At low $[\\text{NH}_x]$, GDH is favored because it has a lower $K_m$ for $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$ than GS has for $\\mathrm{NH_3}$, and GDH uses ATP to drive the reaction; at high $[\\text{NH}_x]$, GS–GOGAT takes over because GOGAT generates NADPH that offsets ATP costs. GS adenylylation activates GS to increase its flux under nitrogen excess.\n\nC. GS–GOGAT dominates at low $[\\text{NH}_x]$ solely because its reactions are more exergonic irrespective of ammonia speciation or enzyme saturation; kinetics and regulation are unnecessary to invoke. GOGAT universally uses Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NADH), not Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH), and therefore the cell avoids depleting NADPH. At high $[\\text{NH}_x]$, GDH remains disfavored because its reaction is endergonic unless $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ is abundant.\n\nD. The decisive factor is that at $pH\\,7.5$ essentially all ammonia is $\\mathrm{NH_3}$, which GS cannot use efficiently, whereas GDH directly binds $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ with low $K_m$; hence GDH always dominates unless GS is adenylylated, which increases GS activity under nitrogen limitation. Cofactor usage is irrelevant because ATP and NADPH costs are comparable between the pathways.", "solution": "The problem statement must first be validated for scientific soundness, self-consistency, and clarity before a solution is attempted.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Metabolic Pathways:** Two pathways for assimilating inorganic nitrogen into L-glutamate in an aerobic bacterium.\n    1.  **GS–GOGAT Pathway:**\n        -   Glutamine Synthetase (GS): Incorporates $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ into L-glutamine, consuming Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n        -   Glutamate Synthase (GOGAT): Transfers amide nitrogen to $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate, forming L-glutamate, using Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH) as a reductant.

The functions, cofactor requirements (ATP for GS, NADPH for GOGAT/GDH), and regulatory mechanisms (adenylylation of GS) are all standard and well-documented concepts in microbiology and biochemistry. The provided kinetic values reflect the known physiological roles: a high-affinity pathway (GS-GOGAT) and a low-affinity pathway (GDH). The chemical data ($\\text{p}K_a$, $\\mathrm{pH}$) are standard. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness and Consistency:** The problem is well-posed. It provides two distinct, well-defined conditions (low and high nitrogen) and gives all necessary kinetic, thermodynamic, and regulatory data required to compare the pathway fluxes and efficiencies under these conditions. The information is internally consistent and sufficient to arrive at a reasoned conclusion.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe choice of pathway is determined by a combination of substrate availability, enzyme kinetics, thermodynamics, and regulation. We must analyze each of these factors for the two specified nitrogen regimes.\n\n**1. Substrate Speciation and Concentration**\nThe substrates for the two pathways are different chemical species: $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ for GS and $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$ for GDH. We must calculate their respective concentrations at $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.5$ using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}/\\mathrm{NH_3}$ equilibrium ($\\mathrm{p}K_a = 9.25$).\n$$ \\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{p}K_a + \\log_{10} \\frac{[\\mathrm{NH_3}]}{[\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]} $$\n$$ 7.5 = 9.25 + \\log_{10} \\frac{[\\mathrm{NH_3}]}{[\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]} $$\n$$ \\log_{10} \\frac{[\\mathrm{NH_3}]}{[\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]} = -1.75 $$\n$$ \\frac{[\\mathrm{NH_3}]}{[\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]} = 10^{-1.75} \\approx 0.01778 $$\nThis ratio indicates that ammonium ion ($\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$) is the predominant species, with $[\\mathrm{NH_4^+}] \\approx 56 \\times [\\mathrm{NH_3}]$. More precisely, the fraction of total ammonia present as $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ is $f_{\\mathrm{NH_3}} = \\frac{10^{-1.75}}{1 + 10^{-1.75}} \\approx 0.0175$, and the fraction as $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$ is $f_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-1.75}} \\approx 0.9825$.\n\nNow we calculate the concentrations for each regime:\n- **Low-Nitrogen Regime:** $[\\text{NH}_x] = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n    - $[\\mathrm{NH_3}] = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{mM} \\times 0.0175 = 0.00175\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n    - $[\\mathrm{NH_4^+}] = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{mM} \\times 0.9825 = 0.09825\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n- **High-Nitrogen Regime:** $[\\text{NH}_x] = 10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n    - $[\\mathrm{NH_3}] = 10\\,\\mathrm{mM} \\times 0.0175 = 0.175\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n    - $[\\mathrm{NH_4^+}] = 10\\,\\mathrm{mM} \\times 0.9825 = 9.825\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n\n**2. Kinetic Analysis and Flux Comparison**\nWe use the Michaelis-Menten equation, $v = V_{\\max} [S] / (K_m + [S])$, to estimate the initial rate of flux through each pathway's first enzyme.\n\n- **Low-Nitrogen Regime ($[\\text{NH}_x] = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$):**\n    - Under nitrogen limitation, GS is unadenylylated, so $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{GS}} = 100$.\n    $$ v_{\\mathrm{GS}} = \\frac{100 \\times [0.00175]}{0.010 + 0.00175} = \\frac{0.175}{0.01175} \\approx 14.9 \\text{ (arbitrary units)} $$\n    $$ v_{\\mathrm{GDH}} = \\frac{100 \\times [0.09825]}{3.0 + 0.09825} = \\frac{9.825}{3.09825} \\approx 3.17 \\text{ (arbitrary units)} $$\n    - Conclusion: The flux through GS is substantially higher ($14.9$ vs. $3.17$). This is because GS has a very high affinity for its substrate (low $K_m$ of $0.010\\,\\mathrm{mM}$), making it an efficient scavenger even when the substrate concentration is below its $K_m$. In contrast, GDH has a low affinity (high $K_m$ of $3.0\\,\\mathrm{mM}$), and the concentration of its substrate is far below saturation ($[S] \\ll K_m$), resulting in a very low reaction rate.\n\n- **High-Nitrogen Regime ($[\\text{NH}_x] = 10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$):**\n    - Under nitrogen excess, GS is adenylylated, reducing its $V_{\\max}$ by a factor of $5$. Thus, $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{GS}} = 100 / 5 = 20$.\n    $$ v_{\\mathrm{GS}} = \\frac{20 \\times [0.175]}{0.010 + 0.175} = \\frac{3.5}{0.185} \\approx 18.9 \\text{ (arbitrary units)} $$\n    $$ v_{\\mathrm{GDH}} = \\frac{100 \\times [9.825]}{3.0 + 9.825} = \\frac{982.5}{12.825} \\approx 76.6 \\text{ (arbitrary units)} $$\n    - Conclusion: The flux through GDH is now significantly higher ($76.6$ vs. $18.9$). The high concentration of $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$ ($9.825\\,\\mathrm{mM}$) overcomes the high $K_m$ of GDH, driving the reaction at over $75\\%$ of its $V_{\\max}$. Concurrently, the GS pathway is down-regulated by adenylylation, limiting its maximum flux even though its substrate, $\\mathrm{NH_3}$, is now at a saturating concentration ($[S] \\gg K_m$).\n\n**3. Thermodynamic and Energetic Considerations**\n- The GS-GOGAT pathway consumes one molecule of ATP per molecule of ammonia assimilated. The hydrolysis of ATP ($\\Delta G'^{\\circ} \\approx -30.5\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$) makes the overall process strongly exergonic and effectively irreversible. This large thermodynamic driving force is critical for scavenging nitrogen when its concentration is low.\n- The GDH pathway consumes no ATP. It is more energy-efficient. The statement that it is 'near thermodynamic equilibrium' implies its standard free energy change is close to zero, and it relies on a high substrate-to-product ratio (mass action) to achieve a net forward flux. This is only feasible when the substrate, $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$, is abundant, as in the high-nitrogen regime.\n\n**Synthesis**\nAt low nitrogen concentrations, the cell prioritizes scavenging efficiency. It expends ATP to power the high-affinity, thermodynamically favorable GS-GOGAT pathway, which is fully active (unadenylylated). The low-affinity, ATP-independent GDH pathway is kinetically incompetent under these conditions.\nAt high nitrogen concentrations, scavenging is no longer a challenge. The cell prioritizes energy conservation. It switches to the GDH pathway, which is now kinetically competent due to high substrate levels and saves ATP. Simultaneously, the cell down-regulates the ATP-consuming GS-GOGAT pathway via adenylylation of GS.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A.** This option correctly states that: (1) $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ is a minor species at $\\mathrm{pH}\\,7.5$; (2) at low nitrogen, the low $K_m$ of GS and ATP coupling make GS-GOGAT kinetically and thermodynamically favorable, while the high $K_m$ of GDH makes it disfavored; (3) at high nitrogen, high $[\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]$ overcomes the high $K_m$ of GDH, allowing a high, ATP-sparing flux; (4) regulation (adenylylation of GS) correctly matches the conditions, reducing GS capacity under nitrogen excess. This provides a complete, multi-faceted, and correct explanation. The mention of transcriptional regulation of GDH is supplementary information not strictly from the prompt, but it does not invalidate the core argument, which is soundly based on the provided data.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n- **B.** This option contains multiple falsehoods. It incorrectly claims GDH is favored at low $[\\text{NH}_x]$, that GDH has a lower $K_m$ than GS, that GDH uses ATP, that GOGAT generates NADPH, and that GS adenylylation is an activation mechanism. Every key assertion is wrong.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n- **C.** This option incorrectly attributes the switch solely to thermodynamics, dismissing kinetics and regulation which are essential. It incorrectly states that GOGAT uses NADH, contradicting the problem statement. It also incorrectly claims GDH remains disfavored at high $[\\text{NH}_x]$ and mistakenly links its activity to $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ instead of $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n- **D.** This option begins with a statement that is diametrically opposed to the facts of ammonia speciation at $\\mathrm{pH}\\,7.5$ (it claims $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ is the major species). It misidentifies the GDH substrate as $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ and its affinity as high (low $K_m$). It reverses the logic of GS regulation by adenylylation. Finally, it wrongly dismisses the crucial energetic difference (ATP consumption) between the pathways.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, option A is the only one that accurately integrates all the provided information—kinetics, thermodynamics, acid-base chemistry, and regulation—to explain the metabolic switch.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2469646"}, {"introduction": "This final practice connects the core process of nitrogen assimilation to the broader network of amino acid biosynthesis.

The keto group of $\\text{3-phosphohydroxypyruvate}$ is replaced by an amino group to form $\\text{3-phosphoserine}$. This reaction is catalyzed by a transaminase, which uses an amino acid/$\\alpha$-keto acid pair. The common amino group donor for this reaction is $\\text{L-glutamate}$, which is converted to its corresponding $\\alpha$-keto acid, $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate.\n$$ \\text{3-phosphohydroxypyruvate} + \\text{L-glutamate} \\rightarrow \\text{3-phosphoserine} + \\alpha\\text{-ketoglutarate} $$\nFrom this reaction, it is clear that the **immediate amino group donor** for the synthesis of the serine backbone is **$\\text{L-glutamate}$**.\n\nStep $3$: Dephosphorylation. The phosphate group is removed from $\\text{3-phosphoserine}$ by hydrolysis, catalyzed by a phosphatase, yielding $\\text{L-serine}$ and inorganic phosphate ($\\mathrm{P_i}$).\n$$ \\text{3-phosphoserine} + \\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O} \\rightarrow \\text{L-serine} + \\mathrm{P_i} $$\n\nTo obtain the net equation for serine synthesis, we sum these three reactions and cancel the intermediates ($\\text{3-phosphohydroxypyruvate}$ and $\\text{3-phosphoserine}$):\n$$ (\\text{3-PG} + \\mathrm{NAD}^+) + (\\text{3-PHP} + \\text{L-Glu}) + (\\text{3-PSer} + \\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}) \\rightarrow (\\text{3-PHP} + \\mathrm{NADH} + \\mathrm{H}^+) + (\\text{3-PSer} + \\alpha\\text{-KG}) + (\\text{L-Ser} + \\mathrm{P_i}) $$\nThe net reaction for serine synthesis, where $\\text{L-glutamate}$ is the amino donor, is:\n$$ \\text{3-phosphoglycerate} + \\mathrm{NAD}^+ + \\text{L-glutamate} + \\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O} \\rightarrow \\text{L-serine} + \\mathrm{NADH} + \\mathrm{H}^+ + \\alpha\\text{-ketoglutarate} + \\mathrm{P_i} $$\n\nNext, we address the regeneration of $\\text{L-glutamate}$ from $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate using ammonium, which is the **ultimate origin of the nitrogen atom**. This is achieved by the glutamine synthetase–glutamate synthase (GS-GOGAT) pathway. The problem provides the stoichiometry for these two reactions:\n$$ \\text{GS:} \\quad \\text{L-glutamate} + \\mathrm{NH_4^+} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{L-glutamine} + \\text{ADP} + \\mathrm{P_i} + \\mathrm{H}^+ $$\n$$ \\text{GOGAT:} \\quad \\text{L-glutamine} + \\alpha\\text{-ketoglutarate} + \\text{NADPH} + \\mathrm{H}^+ \\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{L-glutamate} + \\mathrm{NADP}^+ $$\n\nTo find the net reaction for synthesizing the one molecule of $\\text{L-glutamate}$ required for the serine pathway, we sum the GS and GOGAT reactions. The $\\text{L-glutamine}$ produced by GS is consumed by GOGAT, and one of the two $\\text{L-glutamate}$ molecules produced by GOGAT replaces the one consumed by GS.\n$$ (\\text{L-Glu} + \\mathrm{NH_4^+} + \\text{ATP}) + (\\text{L-Gln} + \\alpha\\text{-KG} + \\text{NADPH} + \\mathrm{H}^+) \\rightarrow (\\text{L-Gln} + \\text{ADP} + \\mathrm{P_i} + \\mathrm{H}^+) + (2\\,\\text{L-Glu} + \\mathrm{NADP}^+) $$\nCanceling the intermediates ($\\text{L-glutamine}$, one $\\text{L-glutamate}$, and one $\\mathrm{H}^+$) from both sides yields the net reaction for nitrogen assimilation into glutamate:\n$$ \\alpha\\text{-ketoglutarate} + \\mathrm{NH}_4^+ + \\text{ATP} + \\text{NADPH} \\rightarrow \\text{L-glutamate} + \\text{ADP} + \\mathrm{P_i} + \\mathrm{NADP}^+ $$\n\nFinally, we combine the net equation for serine synthesis with the net equation for nitrogen assimilation to obtain a single overall reaction that describes the synthesis of $\\text{L-serine}$ from $\\text{3-phosphoglycerate}$ and $\\mathrm{NH}_4^+$. We add the two net equations:\n$$ \\text{Serine Synthesis:} \\quad \\text{3-PG} + \\mathrm{NAD}^+ + \\text{L-Glu} + \\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O} \\rightarrow \\text{L-Ser} + \\mathrm{NADH} + \\mathrm{H}^+ + \\alpha\\text{-KG} + \\mathrm{P_i} $$\n$$ \\text{N-Assimilation:} \\quad \\alpha\\text{-KG} + \\mathrm{NH}_4^+ + \\text{ATP} + \\text{NADPH} \\rightarrow \\text{L-Glu} + \\text{ADP} + \\mathrm{P_i} + \\mathrm{NADP}^+ $$\nSumming these equations allows for the cancellation of the catalytic pair $\\text{L-glutamate}$ and $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate.\n$$ \\text{3-phosphoglycerate} + \\mathrm{NAD}^+ + \\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O} + \\mathrm{NH}_4^+ + \\text{ATP} + \\text{NADPH} \\rightarrow \\text{L-serine} + \\mathrm{NADH} + \\mathrm{H}^+ + 2\\,\\mathrm{P_i} + \\text{ADP} + \\mathrm{NADP}^+ $$\nThis is the final, overall balanced equation.\n\nThe question asks for the net number of moles of adenosine triphosphate hydrolyzed per mole of serine synthesized. From the final overall equation, we can observe the fate of ATP. For each mole of $\\text{L-serine}$ synthesized, one mole of $\\text{ATP}$ is converted to one mole of $\\text{ADP}$ and one mole of inorganic phosphate ($\\mathrm{P_i}$). This conversion represents the hydrolysis of one high-energy phosphoanhydride bond.\nTherefore, the net energy cost is the hydrolysis of $1$ mole of $\\text{ATP}$ per mole of $\\text{L-serine}$ produced.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2469709"}]}
