This exercise challenges you to design a minimal, functional origin of replication (`oriC`) from the ground up, using only first principles of molecular biophysics. By considering the requirements for cooperative protein binding and the mechanics of DNA, you will determine the essential arrangement of DnaA initiator protein binding sites and the DNA Unwinding Element (DUE) needed to kickstart the entire process [@problem_id:2528447]. This practice develops the crucial skill of translating abstract mechanistic knowledge into a concrete, functional design.", "problem": "You are engineering a synthetic minimal origin of replication for a Gram-negative bacterium using the mechanistic features established for the Escherichia coli chromosomal origin. The design must specify only the essential sequence modules: a cluster of DnaA recognition sites (DnaA boxes) and an adjacent Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) Unwinding Element (DUE). Your goal is to choose a design that is sufficient yet minimal, grounded in first principles of cooperative protein binding and DNA mechanics.\n\nUse the following foundational facts to reason your design:\n- DnaA is an Adenosine Triphosphatase (ATPase) of the ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities (AAA+) family that binds sequence-specific DnaA boxes with a defined polarity and forms head-to-tail oligomers on DNA via protein–protein interfaces that depend on the relative orientation and phasing of bound protomers.\n- Cooperative binding requires that adjacent protomers simultaneously stabilize each other through at least two protein–protein interfaces to resist thermal dissociation and to generate sufficient mechanical work to initiate duplex opening.\n- B-form DNA has a helical pitch of approximately $10.5$ base pairs (bp) per turn, so sites separated by approximately integer multiples of $10.5$ bp are aligned on the same helical face.

DnaA is an Adenosine Triphosphatase (ATPase) of the ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities (AAA+) family that binds sequence-specific DnaA boxes with a defined polarity and forms head-to-tail oligomers on Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) via protein–protein interfaces that depend on the relative orientation and phasing of bound protomers.\n2.  Cooperative binding requires that adjacent protomers simultaneously stabilize each other through at least two protein–protein interfaces to resist thermal dissociation and to generate sufficient mechanical work to initiate duplex opening.\n3.  B-form DNA has a helical pitch of approximately $10.5$ base pairs (bp) per turn, so sites separated by approximately integer multiples of $10.5$ bp are aligned on the same helical face. The DnaA box footprint is approximately $9$ bp.\n4.  The DNA Unwinding Element (DUE) must be sufficiently Adenine/Thymine-rich to lower the energetic cost of local strand separation and sufficiently long to support a stable, initiation-competent single-stranded bubble in the presence of physiological negative supercoiling and bound initiator.\n\nThe goal is to identify the minimal specification for a functional oriC-like module based only on these principles.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem is evaluated for validity:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The provided facts about DnaA, cooperative binding, DNA structure, and the function of a DUE are all well-established principles in molecular biology and biophysics, particularly concerning the mechanism of replication initiation in *Escherichia coli*. The problem is firmly based on established science.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem asks for the deduction of a minimal design based on a specified set of constraints. The constraints are clear and allow for a logical derivation of a unique set of architectural features. A meaningful solution can be found.\n-   **Objective**: The language is precise and technical. It presents facts and asks for a logical conclusion, free from subjective or ambiguous phrasing.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It provides a self-contained set of principles from which a solution can be logically derived. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. I will proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\n### Derivation of Minimal Requirements\n\nThe task is to deduce the minimal requirements for the number of DnaA boxes, their orientation, their spacing, and the DUE length, based strictly on the provided principles.\n\n1.  **Minimal Number of DnaA Boxes**:\n    The second principle states that cooperative binding requires \"at least two protein-protein interfaces\". Let us denote a DnaA protomer as $P$.\n    -   If two protomers, $P_1$ and $P_2$, are bound to two DnaA boxes, they can form at most one interface between them: $P_1–P_2$.\n    -   To form two interfaces, a minimum of three protomers, $P_1, P_2, P_3$, are necessary, allowing for two adjacent interfaces: $P_1–P_2$ and $P_2–P_3$.\n    -   Therefore, the absolute minimum number of DnaA boxes required to bind three protomers and satisfy this condition is $3$.\n\n2.  **Orientation of DnaA Boxes**:\n    The first principle states that DnaA forms \"head-to-tail oligomers\". This explicitly defines the mode of protein–protein interaction. For a continuous oligomer to form, each protomer must be oriented in the same direction relative to the DNA backbone. This means the DnaA recognition sites (DnaA boxes) must all have the same orientation (e.g., all \"head-to-tail\" relative to one another along the strand). Any arrangement involving inverted boxes (head-to-head) would disrupt this specific oligomerization.\n\n3.  **Spacing Between DnaA Boxes**:\n    The first and third principles address spacing. For protomers to interact via protein–protein interfaces, they must be positioned correctly with respect to each other.\n    -   Principle 3 states that sites on the same helical face are separated by integer multiples of $\\approx 10.5$ bp. To form a compact oligomer, adjacent protomers must be on the same helical face.\n    -   A center-to-center spacing of approximately one helical turn ($\\approx 10.5$ bp) is the most direct and sterically favorable arrangement for adjacent protomers to interact.\n    -   The DnaA box footprint is stated to be $\\approx 9$ bp. A center-to-center spacing smaller than this, such as $5$ bp, is physically impossible as it would require the DnaA boxes to overlap.\n    -   A spacing of two helical turns ($\\approx 21$ bp) places the protomers on the same face but at a considerable distance. This would likely inhibit the formation of the strong, direct protein–protein contacts characteristic of a stable oligomer, or it would require significant and energetically costly DNA looping between the boxes, making it a non-minimal or less favorable configuration compared to a single-turn spacing.\n    -   Thus, the optimal and minimal spacing is approximately one helical turn, $\\approx 10.5$ bp.\n\n4.  **Minimal DUE Length**:\n    The fourth principle requires the DUE to be long enough to form a \"stable, initiation-competent single-stranded bubble\". While no explicit number is given in the principles, we can use biophysical reasoning. A short stretch of unwound DNA (e.g., $\\approx 10–20$ bp) is thermally unstable and has a high propensity to re-anneal. For a bubble to be stable enough to allow the binding of subsequent replication factors (like DnaB helicase), it must exceed a certain critical length. The canonical *E. coli* oriC contains a DUE consisting of three $13$-mer repeats, for a total length of $39$ bp. This serves as a well-established, biologically functional benchmark for a minimal, stable DUE. A length of $20$ bp is likely insufficient, whereas a length of $39$ bp is a plausible and empirically supported minimum.\n\n**Summary of Derived Minimal Design**:\nA minimal, functional origin should consist of at least $3$ DnaA boxes in a head-to-tail orientation, separated by a center-to-center distance of approximately $10.5$ bp (one helical turn), and adjacent to an AT-rich DUE of at least $\\approx 39$ bp in length.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nEach option is now evaluated against these derived requirements.\n\n**A. $2$ DnaA boxes in head-to-head orientation, separated center-to-center by $10.5$ bp, followed by an AT-rich DUE of $20$ bp.**\n-   **Number of boxes**: $2$ boxes can only form one protein–protein interface, which contradicts the requirement for \"at least two\".\n-   **Orientation**: \"Head-to-head\" orientation is inconsistent with the formation of \"head-to-tail oligomers\".\n-   **DUE length**: $20$ bp is likely too short for a stable bubble.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option violates multiple fundamental principles.\n\n**B. $3$ DnaA boxes in head-to-tail orientation, separated center-to-center by approximately one helical turn (implemented as alternating $10$ bp and $11$ bp such that each adjacent pair is $\\approx 11$ bp), followed by an AT-rich DUE of at least $39$ bp.**\n-   **Number of boxes**: $3$ is the correct minimum number to achieve two protein–protein interfaces.\n-   **Orientation**: \"Head-to-tail\" is the correct orientation for oligomerization.\n-   **Spacing**: \"approximately one helical turn\" is the correct principle. The implementation as integer spacings of $10$ bp and $11$ bp is a practical way to approximate the non-integer $10.5$ bp pitch, maintaining the helical phasing.\n-   **DUE length**: \"at least $39$ bp\" is a biophysically plausible and empirically supported minimal length.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**. This option is fully consistent with all principles derived for a minimal functional design, despite slightly confusing phrasing about spacing implementation.\n\n**C. $4$ DnaA boxes in head-to-tail orientation with $5$ bp center-to-center spacing to maximize local density, followed by an AT-rich DUE of $60$ bp.**\n-   **Spacing**: A center-to-center spacing of $5$ bp is physically impossible, as the footprint of each DnaA box is $\\approx 9$ bp. The binding sites would severely overlap.\n-   **Minimality**: $4$ boxes and a $60$ bp DUE are not minimal if $3$ boxes and a $39$ bp DUE are sufficient.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The proposed spacing is impossible.\n\n**D. $3$ DnaA boxes with alternating head-to-tail and head-to-head orientations (i.e., neighbors inverted), separated center-to-center by $10.5$ bp, followed by an AT-rich DUE of $39$ bp.**\n-   **Orientation**: The \"alternating\" head-to-tail and head-to-head orientation is in direct contradiction with the requirement for forming \"head-to-tail oligomers\". An inverted protomer would break the continuity of the filament.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This design is mechanistically flawed due to incorrect protein orientation.\n\n**E. $3$ DnaA boxes in head-to-tail orientation, separated center-to-center by $21$ bp, followed by an AT-rich DUE of $39$ bp.**\n-   **Spacing**: A spacing of $21$ bp is approximately two full helical turns ($2 \\times 10.5$ bp). While this aligns the protomers on the same helical face, the large separation would hinder the formation of a compact, stable oligomer based on direct protein–protein contacts between adjacent units. It is not the most parsimonious or energetically favorable design for generating mechanical stress. The minimal design would favor the closest possible interaction, which is a spacing of one helical turn.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The spacing is too large for an efficient minimal design based on adjacent protomer interactions.\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, Option B is the only one that correctly integrates all the provided biophysical and molecular principles into a coherent, minimal, and functional design.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2528447"}, {"introduction": "A well-designed system is often best understood by analyzing what happens when it breaks.

The sequence contains exactly three high-affinity DnaA boxes (consensus near TTATCCACA) separated by native-like spacing and orientation, two recognizable low-affinity DnaA sites, and a $40$ base pair adenosine–thymine-rich DNA unwinding element (DUE). No other sequence motifs were purposefully included. Assume the following foundational facts and definitions as a starting point: (i) Adenosine Triphosphate–bound DnaA (DnaA–ATP) can bind both high- and low-affinity DnaA boxes, while Adenosine Diphosphate–bound DnaA (DnaA–ADP) occupies primarily high-affinity boxes; (ii) cooperative oligomerization of DnaA–ATP across multiple low-affinity sites generates torsional strain and promotes melting of the DUE; (iii) DUEs are easier to unwind when enriched in adenosine–thymine base pairs, which have $2$ hydrogen bonds, compared to guanosine–cytosine base pairs, which have $3$; (iv) loading of the replicative DnaB helicase by DnaC requires single-stranded DNA generated from the DUE and is facilitated by direct interactions with the DnaA oligomer; (v) DNA-bending proteins such as Integration Host Factor (IHF) and Factor for Inversion Stimulation (Fis) modulate initiation efficiency and timing but are not strictly essential under permissive conditions; (vi) in many bacteria, short “DnaA-trio” sequence repeats adjacent to the DUE stabilize DnaA interaction with single-stranded DUE and aid helicase loading.\n\nUnder these constraints and assuming normal cellular concentrations of DnaA and accessory factors, which statement best predicts whether initiation would proceed in vivo from this synthetic sequence and identifies the most likely bottleneck step?\n\nA. Initiation would proceed efficiently; the principal bottleneck would occur later at the Tus–Ter replication termination barrier, not during initiation.\n\nB. Initiation would be at best severely inefficient and often fail under physiological conditions; the primary bottleneck is inadequate DnaA–ATP oligomer formation across too few low-affinity sites, leading to unstable DUE melting and ineffective DnaB–DnaC helicase loading, exacerbated by the absence of defined DnaA-trio–like single-stranded recognition elements.\n\nC. Initiation would not occur because the $40$ base pair DUE is too short to unwind; oriC-like DUEs require substantially longer adenosine–thymine tracts to melt.\n\nD.

It describes a plausible molecular biology experiment based on the established mechanism of prokaryotic DNA replication initiation, centered on the DnaA protein and the *oriC* origin in *Escherichia coli*. The provided facts (i-vi) are correct representations of key principles in this process.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a defined system (the synthetic origin) and a set of rules (the foundational facts), and asks for a logical prediction of its function, which is a standard scientific problem structure.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. It provides sufficient information to deduce the most likely outcome without requiring external knowledge beyond what is considered foundational in the field. There are no internal contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A rigorous analysis can proceed.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe initiation of replication at the *Escherichia coli* origin, *oriC*, is a multi-step process that is tightly regulated. We must evaluate the synthetic origin's ability to support this process based on the provided facts.\n\nThe native *E. coli oriC* is approximately $245$ base pairs in length and contains several key elements. These include an array of five high-affinity DnaA boxes (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5), a region for cooperative binding of DnaA–ATP that contains numerous low-affinity sites, and an AT-rich DUE. The process begins with the binding of DnaA molecules to the high-affinity sites, which serves to concentrate the protein at the origin.\n\nThe crucial next step, as stated in fact (ii), is the cooperative oligomerization of DnaA–ATP molecules along the adjacent low-affinity sites. This binding forms a right-handed helical filament that wraps the DNA, inducing significant torsional strain. This strain is what ultimately forces the unwinding of the weak, AT-rich DUE. Without a stable and extensive DnaA–ATP filament, insufficient strain is generated, and the DUE will not melt to create the single-stranded DNA platform needed for helicase loading (fact iv).\n\nLet us analyze the synthetic construct:\n1.  **High-affinity sites**: It contains $3$ high-affinity DnaA boxes. While fewer than the five found in native *oriC*, this is likely sufficient to seed the complex by concentrating DnaA at the locus. This step is not the primary point of failure.\n2.  **Low-affinity sites**: The construct contains only $2$ low-affinity DnaA sites. This represents a catastrophic deficiency. The formation of a functional oligomer capable of generating the required mechanical force for DNA unwinding requires cooperative binding across *multiple* adjacent low-affinity sites. In native *oriC*, this region contains a dozen or more such sites. Two sites are grossly insufficient to support the stable assembly of the required DnaA–ATP filament.\n3.  **DUE**: The $40$ base pair AT-rich DUE is structurally appropriate in length and composition. However, its properties are irrelevant if the machinery to unwind it cannot assemble.\n4.  **Accessory Elements**: The absence of IHF and Fis sites, per fact (v), will reduce efficiency but not block initiation entirely. The absence of DnaA-trio repeats, per fact (vi), removes a stabilizing element that aids helicase loading, further compromising an already flawed process.\n\n**Conclusion**: The primary, and most severe, bottleneck is the drastically insufficient number of low-affinity DnaA sites. This will prevent the formation of a functional DnaA–ATP oligomer, leading to a failure to generate the torsional strain necessary to melt the DUE. Consequently, the replicative helicase (DnaB) cannot be loaded, and initiation fails. The absence of DnaA-trio elements is a secondary defect that would exacerbate the instability of any transiently opened DNA. Therefore, initiation would be, at best, extremely inefficient and most likely non-existent under physiological conditions.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Initiation would proceed efficiently; the principal bottleneck would occur later at the Tus–Ter replication termination barrier, not during initiation.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The analysis demonstrates that initiation itself is fundamentally flawed due to the lack of low-affinity DnaA sites. It will not proceed efficiently. The bottleneck is at the very beginning of the process. Termination is irrelevant if initiation does not occur.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Initiation would be at best severely inefficient and often fail under physiological conditions; the primary bottleneck is inadequate DnaA–ATP oligomer formation across too few low-affinity sites, leading to unstable DUE melting and ineffective DnaB–DnaC helicase loading, exacerbated by the absence of defined DnaA-trio–like single-stranded recognition elements.**\nThis statement accurately reflects the derived conclusion. It correctly identifies the primary bottleneck as the \"inadequate DnaA–ATP oligomer formation across too few low-affinity sites.\" It correctly lists the direct consequences: \"unstable DUE melting\" and \"ineffective DnaB–DnaC helicase loading.\" It also correctly identifies the absence of DnaA-trio elements as an exacerbating factor.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Initiation would not occur because the $40$ base pair DUE is too short to unwind; oriC-like DUEs require substantially longer adenosine–thymine tracts to melt.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The native *E. coli oriC* DUE is composed of three $13$-mer repeats, totaling a similar length. A $40$ base pair region is not inherently too short. The failure is not in the DUE itself, but in the lack of mechanical force to unwind it.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Initiation would not occur primarily because three high-affinity DnaA boxes are insufficient; at least four high-affinity boxes are strictly required to seed the initiation complex.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While fewer than the native five, three high-affinity sites are likely sufficient to create a high local concentration of DnaA to begin the process. This defect is minor compared to the critical failure in the low-affinity oligomerization region. This option misidentifies the primary bottleneck.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Initiation would proceed only if explicit IHF and Fis binding sites are provided; without them initiation in vivo is completely blocked irrespective of DnaA site content and DUE composition.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It is in direct contradiction with fact (v) from the problem statement, which explicitly states that these factors are modulatory and \"not strictly essential under permissive conditions.\" Their absence reduces efficiency but does not cause a complete block on its own.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2528397"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the molecular mechanics of initiation, we now zoom out to see how this event is coordinated with the entire cell cycle. This problem requires you to derive fundamental properties of a bacterial population in steady-state growth, based on the celebrated Cooper-Helmstetter model [@problem_id:2528382]. By connecting the replication period ($C$), the post-replication period ($D$), and the cell generation time ($\\tau$), you will quantitatively predict the average number of origins and the origin-to-terminus copy number ratio, revealing the elegant logic of overlapping replication cycles that fuels rapid proliferation.", "problem": "An Escherichia coli cell has a single circular chromosome that initiates replication at a single origin and terminates near the diametrically opposite terminus. In balanced exponential growth, the cell number increases as $N(t)=N(0)\\exp(\\mu t)$ with specific growth rate $\\mu=\\ln(2)/\\tau$, where $\\tau$ is the generation time. The replication program is temporally organized by two constants: the $C$ period (time from replication initiation to replication termination) and the $D$ period (time from replication termination to cell division). Assume the Cooper–Helmstetter coupling between replication initiation and cell division holds deterministically, replication forks move at constant speed so that termination occurs exactly $C$ minutes after initiation, and the population is asynchronous but in steady state. Also assume that the Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) at the origin is duplicated effectively at the moment of initiation.\n\nUsing only these base assumptions, derive from first principles of balanced exponential growth how the steady-state average copy number per cell of any chromosomal marker depends on the time interval $a$ between that marker’s duplication event and the subsequent cell division of the lineage that produced it.

Report your final result as a two-entry row vector [average origin number, ori/ter ratio]. The final quantities are dimensionless.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the average copy number of a chromosomal marker in a steady-state bacterial population, and then to apply this result to find the average number of replication origins and the origin-to-terminus copy number ratio.\n\nThe foundation of this analysis is the age distribution of cells in an asynchronously dividing population undergoing balanced exponential growth. For a population with generation time $\\tau$, the number of cells grows as $N(t) = N(0) 2^{t/\\tau}$. In this steady state, the fraction of cells with age $x \\in [0, \\tau]$ (time since birth) in the interval $dx$ is given by the normalized age distribution function $P(x)dx$, where\n$$P(x) = \\frac{2 \\ln(2)}{\\tau} 2^{-x/\\tau}$$\nThe average copy number of any marker $M$, denoted $\\langle N_M \\rangle$, is the average of the copy number within a single cell, $g_M(x)$, over this population distribution:\n$$\\langle N_M \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} g_M(x) P(x) dx = \\frac{2 \\ln(2)}{\\tau} \\int_{0}^{\\tau} g_M(x) 2^{-x/\\tau} dx$$\n\nThe problem defines a time interval $a$ between a marker's duplication and the subsequent cell division. Our first task is to determine $g_M(x)$, the number of copies of marker $M$ in a single cell of age $x$. A cell of age $x$ is scheduled to divide at a time $\\tau-x$ in the future. According to the problem's definition, the duplication of marker $M$ for this specific cell division occurs at a time $a$ before the division. Thus, the duplication event happens when the cell's age is $x_{dup} = \\tau - a$. However, this is only true if $0 \\le \\tau-a  \\tau$, which means $0  a \\le \\tau$. Generally, duplication events related to divisions occur at intervals of $\\tau$. The duplication event for the current cell cycle occurs at an age $x_{dup}$ such that $x_{dup} = \\tau - (a \\pmod \\tau)$. Let $r = a \\pmod \\tau = a - \\tau \\lfloor a/\\tau \\rfloor$. Then $x_{dup} = \\tau - r$.\n\nBefore this duplication event ($x  x_{dup}$), the cell has a certain number of copies of the marker, which it inherited at birth. Let this be $g_M(0)$. After the duplication event ($x \\ge x_{dup}$), the forks have passed the marker, and the number of copies in the cell doubles to $2g_M(0)$. So, the copy number function is a step function:\n$$g_M(x) = \\begin{cases} g_M(0)  \\text{for } 0 \\le x  \\tau-r \\\\ 2g_M(0)  \\text{for } \\tau-r \\le x  \\tau \\end{cases}$$\n\nNext, we must determine $g_M(0)$, the number of copies of the marker in a newborn cell. A newborn cell at time $t=0$ inherits its genetic material from a mother cell that just divided. The number of copies it has, $g_M(0)$, corresponds to the number of chromosomes (partially replicated or not) it receives. In the Helmstetter–Cooper model, replication initiation is tied to future cell divisions. A cell division at time $T$ implies a duplication of marker $M$ occurred at time $T-a$. A newborn cell at $t=0$ is the product of a lineage of divisions at times $0, -\\tau, -2\\tau, \\ldots$. The corresponding marker duplication events for this lineage occurred at times $-a, -a-\\tau, -a-2\\tau, \\ldots$. The number of copies a newborn cell inherits, $g_M(0)$, is equal to the number of replication cycles that have already passed the marker's position but have not yet been segregated by a division. This corresponds to the number of past duplication events in the cell's direct lineage whose corresponding divisions are still in the future. The number of such events is the number of non-negative integers $k$ for which the duplication time $-a-k\\tau$ is in the past, relative to the cell's birth at $t=0$. This is equivalent to counting the number of replication cycles initiated on behalf of the cell before its birth, which have proceeded past marker $M$. The number of such completed M-duplication rounds passed to a newborn cell is $k_M = \\lfloor a/\\tau \\rfloor$. Therefore, the number of copies at birth is:\n$$g_M(0) = 2^{\\lfloor a/\\tau \\rfloor}$$\nNote that this correctly predicts that a newborn cell has $g_{ori}(0) = 2^{\\lfloor (C+D)/\\tau \\rfloor}$ origins and $g_{ter}(0) = 2^{\\lfloor D/\\tau \\rfloor}$ termini.\n\nNow we can calculate the average copy number $\\langle N_M \\rangle$ by substituting $g_M(x)$ into the integral:\n$$\\langle N_M \\rangle = \\frac{2 \\ln(2)}{\\tau} \\left[ \\int_{0}^{\\tau-r} g_M(0) 2^{-x/\\tau} dx + \\int_{\\tau-r}^{\\tau} 2g_M(0) 2^{-x/\\tau} dx \\right]$$\n$$\\langle N_M \\rangle = g_M(0) \\frac{2 \\ln(2)}{\\tau} \\left[ \\left(-\\frac{\\tau}{\\ln 2} 2^{-x/\\tau}\\right)_{0}^{\\tau-r} + 2 \\left(-\\frac{\\tau}{\\ln 2} 2^{-x/\\tau}\\right)_{\\tau-r}^{\\tau} \\right]$$\n$$\\langle N_M \\rangle = -2 g_M(0) \\left[ (2^{-(\\tau-r)/\\tau} - 2^0) + 2(2^{-1} - 2^{-(\\tau-r)/\\tau}) \\right]$$\n$$\\langle N_M \\rangle = -2 g_M(0) \\left[ 2^{-1}2^{r/\\tau} - 1 + 1 - 2 \\cdot 2^{-1}2^{r/\\tau} \\right]$$\n$$\\langle N_M \\rangle = -2 g_M(0) [ 2^{-1}2^{r/\\tau} - 2^{r/\\tau} ] = -2 g_M(0) [-2^{-1}2^{r/\\tau}] = g_M(0) 2^{r/\\tau}$$\nSubstituting $g_M(0) = 2^{\\lfloor a/\\tau \\rfloor}$ and $r = a - \\tau\\lfloor a/\\tau \\rfloor$:\n$$\\langle N_M \\rangle = 2^{\\lfloor a/\\tau \\rfloor} \\cdot 2^{(a - \\tau\\lfloor a/\\tau \\rfloor)/\\tau} = 2^{\\lfloor a/\\tau \\rfloor} \\cdot 2^{a/\\tau} \\cdot 2^{-\\lfloor a/\\tau \\rfloor} = 2^{a/\\tau}$$\nThis is the general formula for the average copy number of a chromosomal marker as a function of $a$.\n\nNow we specialize this result.\n1.  **Average number of replication origins per cell**:\n    The origin is duplicated at the moment of replication initiation. The time from initiation to termination is $C$, and from termination to division is $D$. Thus, initiation precedes division by a total time of $C+D$. For the origin, $a_{ori} = C+D$.\n    The average number of origins per cell is:\n    $$\\langle N_{ori} \\rangle = 2^{a_{ori}/\\tau} = 2^{(C+D)/\\tau}$$\n\n2.  **Origin-to-terminus (ori/ter) copy number ratio**:\n    This is the ratio $\\langle N_{ori} \\rangle / \\langle N_{ter} \\rangle$. We need to find the average copy number of the terminus. Replication terminates at a time $C$ after initiation. Division occurs $D$ minutes after termination. Thus, for the terminus, the time between its duplication (termination) and the subsequent cell division is $a_{ter} = D$.\n    The average number of termini per cell is:\n    $$\\langle N_{ter} \\rangle = 2^{a_{ter}/\\tau} = 2^{D/\\tau}$$\n    The ori/ter ratio is therefore:\n    $$\\frac{\\langle N_{ori} \\rangle}{\\langle N_{ter} \\rangle} = \\frac{2^{(C+D)/\\tau}}{2^{D/\\tau}} = 2^{(C+D)/\\tau - D/\\tau} = 2^{C/\\tau}$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate these expressions for the given parameters: $C=40$ min, $D=20$ min, and $\\tau=30$ min.\n\nAverage number of origins:\n$$\\langle N_{ori} \\rangle = 2^{(40+20)/30} = 2^{60/30} = 2^2 = 4$$\n\nOrigin-to-terminus ratio:\n$$\\text{Ratio} = 2^{40/30} = 2^{4/3}$$\n\nThe results are to be reported as a two-entry row vector $\\big[$average origin number, ori/ter ratio$\\big]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4  2^{4/3}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2528382"}]}
