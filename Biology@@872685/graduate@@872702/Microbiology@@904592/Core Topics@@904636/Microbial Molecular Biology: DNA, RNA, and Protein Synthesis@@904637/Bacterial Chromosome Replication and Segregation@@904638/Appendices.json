The relationship $Lk = Tw + Wr$, the concept of supercoiling generated by replication, and the mechanism of Type II topoisomerases are all well-established scientific facts. The provided numerical values for fork speed, helical repeat, and gyrase activity are within physically and biologically realistic ranges for *Escherichia coli*.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is structured to find a unique, meaningful solution. It asks for a specific quantity (the minimum number of enzymes) based on a clear, quantifiable condition (the rate of supercoil generation must be balanced by the rate of removal). All necessary parameters for this calculation ($v$, $h$, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$, $\\Delta Lk$ per gyrase cycle) are provided. The data regarding loop size $s$ and critical density $\\sigma_c$ are not essential for the core calculation under the stated condition of \"no net accumulation,\" but their presence does not create a contradiction; rather, they provide context for the biological importance of the process.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, unbiased scientific language. There are no subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\nVerdict: The problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is deemed **valid**. The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe first step is to determine the rate at which positive supercoils are generated ahead of the replication fork. The replication machinery unwinds the parental DNA duplex as it advances. The helical repeat of B-form DNA is given as $h = 10.5 \\text{ bp turn}^{-1}$. This means that for every $10.5$ base pairs of DNA replicated, the double helix is unwound by one full turn ($2\\pi$ radians). The replication fork translocates at a speed of $v = 840 \\text{ bp s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe rate of helical unwinding, expressed in turns per second, is therefore the translocation speed divided by the number of base pairs per turn:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{unwind}} = \\frac{v}{h}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{unwind}} = \\frac{840 \\text{ bp s}^{-1}}{10.5 \\text{ bp turn}^{-1}} = 80 \\text{ turns s}^{-1}$$\nWithin a topologically constrained domain, the linking number $Lk$ is conserved. From the relation $Lk = Tw + Wr$, a change in linking number $\\Delta Lk$ is given by $\\Delta Lk = \\Delta Tw + \\Delta Wr$. Since the domain is constrained, $\\Delta Lk = 0$. Unwinding the helix corresponds to a decrease in the twist, so $\\Delta Tw  0$. Specifically, unwinding by one turn means $\\Delta Tw = -1$. To conserve the linking number, there must be a compensatory change in writhe: $\\Delta Wr = -\\Delta Tw = -(-1) = +1$. This increase in writhe manifests as the formation of one positive supercoil.\n\nTherefore, the rate of generation of positive supercoils, $R_{\\mathrm{gen}}$, is numerically equal to the rate of helical unwinding.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{gen}} = R_{\\mathrm{unwind}} = 80 \\text{ turns s}^{-1}$$\n\nThe problem requires that there be no net accumulation of these positive supercoils. This imposes a steady-state condition where the rate of supercoil generation must be exactly balanced by the rate of supercoil removal by DNA gyrase.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{gen}} = R_{\\mathrm{removal}}$$\nWe must now determine the total rate of removal. A single DNA gyrase enzyme operates with a catalytic turnover of $k_{\\mathrm{cat}} = 2.0 \\text{ s}^{-1}$, meaning it completes $2$ catalytic cycles per second. In each cycle, it introduces a linking number change of $\\Delta Lk = -2$. This corresponds to the removal of $2$ positive supercoils.\n\nThe rate of supercoil removal by a single gyrase enzyme, $R_{\\mathrm{rem, 1}}$, is the product of its catalytic rate and the magnitude of the linking number change per cycle:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{rem, 1}} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} \\times |\\Delta Lk| = (2.0 \\text{ s}^{-1}) \\times 2 \\text{ turns} = 4.0 \\text{ turns s}^{-1}$$\nLet $N$ be the minimum number of concurrently active DNA gyrase enzymes required to balance the generation rate. The total removal rate, $R_{\\mathrm{removal}}$, is the product of the number of enzymes and the rate per enzyme:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{removal}} = N \\times R_{\\mathrm{rem, 1}} = N \\times 4.0 \\text{ turns s}^{-1}$$\nEquating the generation and removal rates to satisfy the steady-state condition:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{gen}} = R_{\\mathrm{removal}}$$\n$$80 \\text{ turns s}^{-1} = N \\times 4.0 \\text{ turns s}^{-1}$$\nSolving for $N$:\n$$N = \\frac{80}{4.0} = 20$$\nThe calculation yields an integer result. Thus, a minimum of $20$ concurrently active DNA gyrase enzymes are required within this topological domain to continuously remove the positive supercoils generated by the replication fork, thereby preventing fork slowdown and stalling. The information about loop size $s$ and critical superhelical density $\\sigma_c$ is contextual, defining the threshold at which problems would arise, but is not needed for the calculation under the strict condition of zero net accumulation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20}$$", "id": "2475900"}, {"introduction": "On the lagging strand, DNA synthesis occurs discontinuously through the production of Okazaki fragments.

The replication fork exposes single-stranded template at a constant fork velocity $v$ (in nucleotides per second). Primase synthesizes RNA primers on the lagging-strand template as a memoryless stochastic process: initiations occur as a Poisson process with rate $\\alpha$ (in per second). After each successful primer synthesis, the clamp loader executes a required clamp loading step of deterministic duration $\\tau_{c}$ (in seconds) before the replicative polymerase can engage and elongate the fragment; during this clamp loading interval, no new primer can become a functional start site for a new Okazaki fragment (that is, clamp loading imposes a nonparalyzable dead time of length $\\tau_{c}$ on the priming-to-priming cycle).\n\nDefine the length of an Okazaki fragment as the spatial distance along the template between the starts of two consecutive, functionally used primers.

Let $T$ be the random variable representing the total time elapsed between two consecutive functional priming events. A functional priming event is defined as the synthesis of a primer that is successfully used to initiate a new Okazaki fragment.\n\nThe cycle for generating one such fragment consists of two distinct, consecutive phases:\n1. A deterministic clamp loading period of duration $\\tau_{c}$. This is a \"dead time\" during which no new primer can be utilized.\n2. A stochastic waiting period, let us call it $T_{wait}$, for the next successful primase initiation event to occur.

The waiting time for the first event in a Poisson process is described by an exponential distribution. Thus, $T_{wait}$ is an exponentially distributed random variable with rate parameter $\\alpha$. The probability density function is $p(t) = \\alpha \\exp(-\\alpha t)$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nThe expected value of this waiting time, $E[T_{wait}]$, is the reciprocal of the rate:\n$$ E[T_{wait}] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t \\cdot \\alpha \\exp(-\\alpha t) \\, dt = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} $$\nTo find the expected mean time between two consecutive functional priming events, we take the expectation of the total time $T$.
