The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded in the established principles of biophysical modeling of gene regulation.\n\nWe begin by formalizing the system. The promoter can exist in one of three mutually exclusive states:\n$1$. The promoter is empty (unbound).\n$2$. The promoter is bound by a single Ribonucleic Acid polymerase (RNAP) molecule.\n$3$. The promoter is bound by a single repressor protein molecule.\n\nAccording to the prompt, the statistical weight of each state is proportional to $\\exp(-\\beta \\Delta \\epsilon)$, where $\\beta = (k_B T)^{-1}$ and $\\Delta \\epsilon$ is the binding energy of the protein to its specific site on the Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) relative to a nonspecific site. The weights must also account for the concentration of the molecules. The effective concentration is given as the copy number of the protein divided by the number of nonspecific binding sites in the cell, $N_{\\text{NS}}$.\n\nLet us define the statistical weights for each state:\nThe empty state of the promoter is the reference state, so its statistical weight is set to $1$.\nThe statistical weight for the RNAP-bound state, which we denote as $w_p$, is:\n$$w_p = \\frac{P}{N_{\\text{NS}}} \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta \\epsilon_p)$$\nwhere $P$ is the copy number of RNAP and $\\Delta \\epsilon_p$ is its specific-to-nonspecific binding energy difference.\n\nThe statistical weight for the repressor-bound state, denoted as $w_r$, is:\n$$w_r = \\frac{R}{N_{\\text{NS}}} \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta \\epsilon_r)$$\nwhere $R$ is the copy number of the repressor and $\\Delta \\epsilon_r$ is its specific-to-nonspecific binding energy difference.\n\nThe partition function, $Z$, which is the sum of the statistical weights of all possible states, is given by:\n$$Z = 1 + w_p + w_r$$\nThis partition function accounts for all three possible configurations of the promoter when both RNAP and repressor are present.\n\nThe probability of finding the promoter in any particular state is the statistical weight of that state divided by the partition function. The problem states that the transcriptional output is proportional to the probability of RNAP being bound to the promoter, $p_{\\text{bound}}$. Therefore, with the repressor present, this probability is:\n$$p_{\\text{bound}}(R0) = \\frac{w_p}{Z} = \\frac{w_p}{1 + w_p + w_r}$$\n\nTo calculate the fold-change, we must also determine the RNAP occupancy in the absence of the repressor. In this scenario, the repressor copy number $R = 0$, which implies that its statistical weight $w_r = 0$. The system can only be in the empty or RNAP-bound state. The partition function for this unregulated system, $Z_0$, is:\n$$Z_0 = 1 + w_p$$\nThe probability of RNAP binding in the absence of the repressor is then:\n$$p_{\\text{bound}}(R=0) = \\frac{w_p}{Z_0} = \\frac{w_p}{1 + w_p}$$\n\nThe fold-change, $FC$, is defined as the ratio of RNAP occupancy with the repressor present to that without the repressor:\n$$FC = \\frac{p_{\\text{bound}}(R0)}{p_{\\text{bound}}(R=0)} = \\frac{\\frac{w_p}{1 + w_p + w_r}}{\\frac{w_p}{1 + w_p}}$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the general formula for fold-change:\n$$FC = \\frac{1 + w_p}{1 + w_p + w_r}$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for the fold-change.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided parameters:\n- RNAP copy number $P = 2000$\n- Repressor copy number $R = 50$\n- Number of nonspecific DNA binding sites $N_{\\text{NS}} = 4.6 \\times 10^{6}$\n- RNAP binding energy $\\Delta \\epsilon_{p} = -5 \\, k_B T$, which implies $-\\beta \\Delta \\epsilon_{p} = 5$\n- Repressor binding energy $\\Delta \\epsilon_{r} = -15 \\, k_B T$, which implies $-\\beta \\Delta \\epsilon_{r} = 15$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless statistical weights $w_p$ and $w_r$:\n$$w_p = \\frac{2000}{4.6 \\times 10^6} \\exp\\left(5\\right) \\approx (4.3478 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times 148.413 \\approx 0.064525$$\n$$w_r = \\frac{50}{4.6 \\times 10^6} \\exp\\left(15\\right) \\approx (1.0870 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times (3.2690 \\times 10^6) \\approx 35.5328$$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the fold-change expression:\n$$FC = \\frac{1 + w_p}{1 + w_p + w_r} = \\frac{1 + 0.064525}{1 + 0.064525 + 35.5328} = \\frac{1.064525}{36.597325} \\approx 0.0290876$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the fold-change is $0.02909$.\n\nFinally, we must determine the dominance indicator $D$:\n$$D \\equiv \\begin{cases} 1,  \\text{if } w_r  \\max\\{1, w_p\\},\\\\ 0,  \\text{otherwise.} \\end{cases}$$\nWe have calculated $w_p \\approx 0.0645$ and $w_r \\approx 35.53$.\nWe evaluate the condition $\\max\\{1, w_p\\}$:\n$$\\max\\{1, 0.0645\\} = 1$$\nThe condition for $D=1$ becomes $w_r  1$.\nSince $w_r \\approx 35.53$, and $35.53  1$, the condition is satisfied.\nTherefore, the dominance indicator $D = 1$. This indicates that in this regime, the repressor's binding contribution ($w_r$) is the dominant factor in setting the promoter's state, being larger than both the weight of the empty state ($1$) and the RNAP-bound state ($w_p$).\n\nThe final result consists of the calculated fold-change and the dominance indicator.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.02909  1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2540934"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the foundational model of simple repression, our next practice shifts from analysis to design.

Further assume the weak-promoter limit, meaning RNAP occupancy is sufficiently small that it does not alter the statistical weight balance between repressor-bound and repressor-free promoter states.

We shall proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe system under consideration is a single promoter whose activity is controlled by a repressor. The behavior of this system is governed by the principles of equilibrium statistical mechanics. The fold-change in gene expression is defined as the ratio of the mean expression level in the presence of $R$ repressors per cell to the mean expression level in the absence of repressors ($R=0$). The problem states that mean gene expression is proportional to the probability that the promoter is not occupied by a repressor, which we denote as $P_{\\text{unbound}}$.\nTherefore, the fold-change $F$ is given by:\n$$ F = \\frac{\\text{Expression}(R)}{\\text{Expression}(0)} = \\frac{C \\cdot P_{\\text{unbound}}(R)}{C \\cdot P_{\\text{unbound}}(0)} = \\frac{P_{\\text{unbound}}(R)}{P_{\\text{unbound}}(0)} $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nTo determine $P_{\\text{unbound}}$, we model the promoter as existing in one of two states relevant to repression: unbound by a repressor or bound by a repressor. The weak-promoter assumption allows us to neglect the states involving RNA polymerase binding when calculating the repressor-binding equilibrium. The probability of the promoter being in the unbound state is given by the ratio of the statistical weight of the unbound state to the sum of the statistical weights of all possible states (the partition function, $Z$):\n$$ P_{\\text{unbound}} = \\frac{w_{\\text{unbound}}}{Z} = \\frac{w_{\\text{unbound}}}{w_{\\text{unbound}} + w_{\\text{bound}}} $$\nWe can set the statistical weight of the unbound state, $w_{\\text{unbound}}$, to $1$ as our reference state.\nThe statistical weight of the state where the promoter is bound by a repressor, $w_{\\text{bound}}$, is given by the product of the fugacity of the repressor, $\\lambda_{R}$, and the Boltzmann factor for the specific binding energy $\\Delta \\varepsilon_{r}$:\n$$ w_{\\text{bound}} = \\lambda_{R} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta \\varepsilon_{r}}{k_{B}T}\\right) $$\nwhere $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe fugacity $\\lambda_{R}$ represents the effective concentration of repressors available to bind the operator. It is determined by the equilibrium of repressors distributed over the $N_{\\text{NS}}$ non-specific binding sites in the cell, which act as a reservoir. The total number of repressors is $R$. The energy of non-specific binding is taken to be the zero reference energy. The chemical potential $\\mu$ of the repressor reservoir is related to $R$ and $N_{\\text{NS}}$. In the limit where the number of repressors is much smaller than the number of non-specific sites ($R \\ll N_{\\text{NS}}$), the average occupancy of any non-specific site is very low. The relationship between the total number of repressors and the chemical potential is given by $R \\approx N_{\\text{NS}} \\exp(\\mu / (k_{B}T))$. The fugacity is defined as $\\lambda_{R} = \\exp(\\mu / (k_{B}T))$. Therefore, we find:\n$$ \\lambda_{R} \\approx \\frac{R}{N_{\\text{NS}}} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $w_{\\text{bound}}$:\n$$ w_{\\text{bound}} = \\frac{R}{N_{\\text{NS}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta \\varepsilon_{r}}{k_{B}T}\\right) $$\nNow we can write the expression for $P_{\\text{unbound}}$ as a function of $R$:\n$$ P_{\\text{unbound}}(R) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{R}{N_{\\text{NS}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta \\varepsilon_{r}}{k_{B}T}\\right)} $$\nIn the absence of repressors, $R=0$, which gives $w_{\\text{bound}}=0$ and $P_{\\text{unbound}}(0) = 1$.

The provided data are consistent and sufficient for the task. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution is tractable.\n\nThe core of this problem is to model the steady-state transcriptional response of a promoter to varying concentrations of an effector molecule, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The response is assumed to follow a sigmoidal dose-response curve, a common characteristic of systems involving cooperative binding. The Hill equation is a canonical mathematical model for such phenomena. The four-parameter Hill function, relating the input concentration $x$ (of cAMP) to the output $y$ (promoter activity), is given by:\n$$ y(x; b, A, K, n) = b + A \\frac{x^n}{K^n + x^n} $$\nIn this equation:\n- $b$ represents the basal or background promoter activity in the absence of the ligand ($x \\to 0$).\n- $A$ represents the amplitude of the response, such that the maximum activity is $b+A$ at saturating ligand concentrations ($x \\to \\infty$).\n- $K$ is the effective midpoint concentration, at which the activity is half-way between the minimum and maximum, i.e., $y(K) = b + A/2$.

It serves as a measure of cooperativity.\n\nThe values for the parameters $\\{b, A, K, n\\}$ are unknown and must be determined for each of the four datasets. This is achieved by fitting the model to the experimental data. The method of choice is nonlinear least-squares regression. This involves finding the set of parameters that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals, $\\chi^2$, which is the discrepancy between the measured promoter activities, $y_{i, \\text{data}}$, and the activities predicted by the model, $y(x_i; b, A, K, n)$, over all $N$ data points:\n$$ \\chi^2(b, A, K, n) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} [y_{i, \\text{data}} - y(x_i; b, A, K, n)]^2 $$\nThis minimization is a numerical optimization problem. We must respect the physical meaning of the parameters by imposing constraints: $b \\ge 0$, $A \\ge 0$, $K  0$, and $n  0$. These constraints are implemented as bounds in the optimization algorithm.\n\nThe central biophysical interpretation rests on the value of the fitted Hill coefficient, $\\hat{n}$. The transcription factor in question, CRP, is a dimer, and each monomer has a binding site for cAMP. A simplified model of ligand binding to a multi-site protein predicts a theoretical maximum Hill coefficient equal to the number of binding sites, which is $n=2$ for a CRP dimer under the assumption of strong cooperativity. Therefore, the value of the empirical Hill coefficient $\\hat{n}$ is compared to this theoretical value.\n- If $\\hat{n}$ is found to be in the range $[\\,1.75,\\,2.25\\,]$ (code $0$), the observed cooperativity is consistent with the standard model of two cooperative cAMP binding events on a CRP dimer.\n- If $\\hat{n}  2.25$ (code $1$), the system exhibits supercooperativity. This implies that additional cooperative interactions, such as cooperative binding of multiple CRP-cAMP complexes to the DNA, are likely at play.\n- If $\\hat{n}  1.75$ (code $-1$), the system is subcooperative.
