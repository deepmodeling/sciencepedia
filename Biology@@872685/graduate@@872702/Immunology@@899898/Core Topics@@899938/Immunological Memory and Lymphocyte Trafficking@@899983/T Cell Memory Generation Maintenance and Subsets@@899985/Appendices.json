It also specifies that the $2$ molecules of cytosolic Reduced Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NADH) generated during glycolysis are consumed in the reduction of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase.

The goal is to obtain an unbiased estimate across memory clonotypes that differ in T cell receptor (TCR) affinity and to control off-target binding.\n\nUse the following well-tested principles as your base: (i) receptor–ligand binding at equilibrium yields an approximate fractional occupancy $f$ of receptor sites given by $f = \\dfrac{[L]}{[L] + K_{d}}$, where $[L]$ is free ligand concentration and $K_{d}$ is the equilibrium dissociation constant; (ii) detection by tetramer staining requires sufficient bound multimer to surpass a positive gate, which can be modeled as a minimal occupancy threshold $f_{\\mathrm{thr}}$; (iii) off-target events arise from non-TCR interactions with the fluorochrome–streptavidin scaffold, sticky cell types, dead cells, and co-receptor–mediated binding, and can be estimated by matched decoy tetramers and eliminated by appropriate gating.\n\nYou analyze a memory pool in which the true antigen-specific frequency is $1.0\\%$ of CD8 T cells, composed of two clonotypes at equal true frequencies, each with a different effective dissociation constant for the tetramer at $4^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$: clonotype $H$ with $K_{d,\\mathrm{eff}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and clonotype $L$ with $K_{d,\\mathrm{eff}} = 200\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.

We will first analyze the initial staining condition and then evaluate each statement.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $f$, of the T cell receptor (TCR) by the peptide-MHC tetramer is given by the formula $f = \\dfrac{[L]}{[L] + K_{d,\\mathrm{eff}}}$, where $[L]$ is the tetramer concentration and $K_{d,\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the effective dissociation constant.

In this case, only clonotype H is detected. Therefore, the measured frequency is $0.5\\%$. The true frequency is $1.0\\%$. The measurement thus underestimates the true frequency by a factor of $1.0\\% / 0.5\\% = 2$. This underestimation occurs because the staining condition is not sufficiently sensitive to detect the lower-affinity clonotype L, whose receptor occupancy falls below the positivity threshold.\n\nNow, we evaluate the provided statements.\n\nA. At $[L] = 50\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{thr}} = 0.25$, the measured tetramer-positive frequency will underestimate the true frequency by approximately a factor of $2$ because clonotype $L$ falls below the detection threshold.

Let us check the proposed change to $[L] = 500\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\nFor clonotype H: $f_H = \\dfrac{500}{500 + 5} \\approx 0.99$.\nFor clonotype L: $f_L = \\dfrac{500}{500 + 200} = \\dfrac{5}{7} \\approx 0.714$.\nBoth values are well above $f_{\\mathrm{thr}} = 0.25$. Thus, both clonotypes would be detected, yielding a measured frequency of $0.5\\% + 0.5\\% = 1.0\\%$, which corrects the underestimation and reduces affinity bias. The assertion that increasing ligand concentration increases off-target binding is a general principle in binding assays. The use of a matched decoy tetramer is the correct control to quantify and correct for this background. The statement is entirely logical and correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nB. Performing tetramer staining at $37^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ for $5\\,\\mathrm{min}$ uniformly increases tetramer binding for all affinities and rescues low-affinity clonotypes without changing off-target background, making it the standard condition for low-affinity detection.\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. TCR-pMHC binding kinetics is highly temperature-dependent. Increasing temperature from $4^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ to $37^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ dramatically increases the dissociation rate constant ($k_{\\mathrm{off}}$), often more so than the association rate constant ($k_{\\mathrm{on}}$). This leads to an increase in the equilibrium dissociation constant ($K_d = k_{\\mathrm{off}}/k_{\\mathrm{on}}$), meaning a lower affinity and lower fractional occupancy at equilibrium. Staining is performed at low temperature precisely to stabilize labile interactions, particularly for low-affinity TCRs. Staining at $37^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ would exacerbate the under-detection of clonotype L, not rescue it. The claim that this is a \"standard condition for low-affinity detection\" is factually incorrect. Low temperature staining is the standard.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nC. A companion tetramer engineered to disrupt CD8 co-receptor binding (for example, a CD8-null MHC mutant) can reveal CD8-mediated non-specific interactions; true TCR-dependent binding will decrease less than CD8-only interactions, permitting better discrimination of specific from non-specific events.\nThe CD8 co-receptor binds to the MHC class I molecule and significantly stabilizes the interaction, increasing the overall avidity. This contribution is particularly critical for lower-affinity TCRs. A tetramer with a mutation in the CD8 binding site (a CD8-null mutant) serves as an important control to assess the CD8-dependency of the observed staining. While the phrasing \"CD8-only interactions\" is imprecise, the principle is sound. By comparing staining with a wild-type tetramer versus a CD8-null tetramer, one can dissect the nature of the binding. A true, high-affinity TCR might still bind the CD8-null tetramer, whereas a low-affinity TCR's binding would be severely diminished or ablated. This differential effect provides valuable information to discriminate truly TCR-specific cells from populations whose binding is artifactual or overly dependent on the co-receptor. This is a valid advanced control strategy.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nD. Incorporating a “dump channel” to exclude $CD14^+$, $CD16^+$, $CD19^+$ and dead cells is critical to reduce off-target events that inflate apparent frequencies, especially at higher $[L]$, because the streptavidin–fluorophore scaffold can adhere to these lineages and dead cells.\nThis describes a standard and essential practice in flow cytometry. Monocytes ($CD14^+$), NK cells ($CD16^+$), and B cells ($CD19^+$) are known to non-specifically bind fluorescent reagents. Dead cells are notorious for pan-positive staining. These events constitute a major source of background noise that can be mistaken for a true signal. A \"dump channel\" uses antibodies against these markers to gate out, or exclude, these contaminating populations from analysis. This cleanup is critical for accurate quantification, and its importance grows as reagent concentrations (like $[L]$) are increased, which tends to amplify non-specific binding. The statement is a correct description of a crucial experimental control.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nE. Switching to higher-valency peptide–MHC multimers (for example, dextramers) can lessen under-detection of low-affinity memory clonotypes by increasing avidity, but demands stricter decoy subtraction and lineage/dead-cell exclusion to control the concomitant rise in non-specific binding; with these controls, frequency estimates can be less affinity-biased.\nHigher-valency multimers contain more pMHC monomers than a tetramer (which has $4$). This increased valency leads to a substantial increase in binding avidity, which is the collective strength of multiple binding events. Higher avidity results in a much slower effective off-rate, stabilizing the binding of low-affinity TCRs that would otherwise dissociate too quickly for detection. This directly addresses the problem of under-detecting clonotypes like L. However, these larger, more complex reagents also exhibit greater non-specific binding. Therefore, their use mandates even more stringent controls, such as meticulous decoy subtraction and gating to exclude dead cells and \"sticky\" lineages (as in statement D). When these rigorous controls are applied, the resulting data provides a more accurate, less affinity-biased measurement of the true T cell frequency. This statement correctly outlines the advantages, disadvantages, and necessary controls for using higher-valency multimers.\n**Verdict: Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACDE}$$", "id": "2893907"}, {"introduction": "The immune system maintains a finely tuned balance, and the expansion of memory T cells following a booster vaccination is no exception.

The process is predicated on the principle that the per-capita growth rate of the T cell population decreases linearly with its size due to competition for finite resources, such as survival niches and cytokines. This framework leads to a stable, non-zero equilibrium state.\n\nThe derivation and solution will proceed in three stages: first, the formulation of the governing differential equation from the stated first principles; second, the analytical solution of this equation to find the population trajectory $N(t)$; and third, the specification of the numerical method for parameter estimation.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Governing Differential Equation**\n\nLet $N(t)$ be the number of antigen-specific memory T cells at time $t$. The per-capita growth rate is defined as $\\frac{1}{N(t)}\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}$. The core assumption is that this rate decreases linearly with the population size $N(t)$. We can write this relationship as:\n$$ \\frac{1}{N(t)}\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = f(N(t)) = A - B \\cdot N(t) $$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are positive constants.\n\nThe parameters $A$ and $B$ can be interpreted in biological terms. The parameter $A$ represents the theoretical maximum per-capita growth rate, which occurs when the population size is negligible ($N(t) \\to 0$). This is the intrinsic expansion rate, which we shall denote as $r$. Thus, $A = r$.\n\nThe problem states that there exists a single stable non-zero equilibrium. At equilibrium, the net population growth rate is zero, i.e., $\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = 0$. From the differential equation form\n$$ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = N(t)(A - B \\cdot N(t)) $$\nthe equilibrium points are $N(t) = 0$ and $A - B \\cdot N(t) = 0$. The non-zero equilibrium, which corresponds to the carrying capacity $K$, is therefore $N_{eq} = A/B$. Thus, $K = r/B$, which implies $B = r/K$.\n\nSubstituting these re-parameterized constants back into the differential equation yields the standard logistic growth equation:\n$$ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = N(t) \\left(r - \\frac{r}{K} N(t)\\right) = r N(t) \\left(1 - \\frac{N(t)}{K}\\right) $$\nThis equation fully captures the stipulated dynamics: a growth rate that is maximal at low cell numbers and decreases to zero as the population approaches the carrying capacity $K$.\n\n**2. Analytical Solution for the Population Trajectory $N(t)$**\n\nTo find the population size $N(t)$ at any time $t$, we must solve this first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation with the initial condition $N(0) = N_0$. The method of separation of variables is appropriate here.\n$$ \\frac{dN}{N(1 - N/K)} = r \\, dt $$\nThe left-hand side can be integrated using partial fraction decomposition:\n$$ \\frac{K}{N(K - N)} = \\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{1}{K - N} $$\nThus, the differential equation becomes:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{1}{K - N}\\right) dN = r \\, dt $$\nIntegrating both sides yields:\n$$ \\int \\left(\\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{1}{K - N}\\right) dN = \\int r \\, dt $$\n$$ \\ln|N| - \\ln|K - N| = rt + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is the constant of integration. Assuming the population starts below the carrying capacity ($0 < N(t) < K$), we can drop the absolute value signs.\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{N}{K - N}\\right) = rt + C_1 $$\nExponentiating both sides gives:\n$$ \\frac{N(t)}{K - N(t)} = C e^{rt} \\quad \\text{where } C = e^{C_1} $$\nThe constant $C$ is determined by the initial condition $N(0) = N_0$:\n$$ C = \\frac{N_0}{K - N_0} $$\nSubstituting $C$ back into the equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{N(t)}{K - N(t)} = \\frac{N_0}{K - N_0} e^{rt} $$\nSolving for $N(t)$:\n$$ N(t) (K - N_0) = K N_0 e^{rt} - N(t) N_0 e^{rt} $$\n$$ N(t) (K - N_0 + N_0 e^{rt}) = K N_0 e^{rt} $$\n$$ N(t) = \\frac{K N_0 e^{rt}}{K - N_0 + N_0 e^{rt}} $$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $N_0 e^{rt}$ yields the final, more common form of the logistic function:\n$$ N(t) = \\frac{K}{1 + \\left(\\frac{K}{N_0} - 1\\right)e^{-rt}} $$\nThis equation provides the predicted cell count $N(t)$ at any time $t$, given the initial cell count $N_0$, the intrinsic expansion rate $r$, and the carrying capacity $K$.\n\n**3.

We are given time-series data $(t_i, N_{obs,i})$ for $i = 1, \\dots, n$ points.

A reasonable guess for $r$ can be obtained from the initial exponential growth phase: $r \\approx \\frac{1}{t_1-t_0} \\ln(N_1/N_0)$. A good guess for $K$ is on the order of the maximum observed cell count, potentially larger if the population is still in a rapid growth phase.\n4.  Bounds for the parameters. Physically, both parameters must be positive ($r > 0$, $K > 0$). Furthermore, since the datasets show population growth, the carrying capacity $K$ must be greater than the initial population $N_0$, and practically must be at least as large as the maximum observed count.\n\nFor each dataset, this procedure will be executed to find the optimal values of $r$ and $K$. The final answer requires only the value of $K$, rounded to the nearest integer.", "answer": "[2000000,500000,10000000,800000]", "id": "2893964"}]}
