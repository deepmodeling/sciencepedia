Preexisting memory B cells generated against the original strain compete with newly recruited naive B cells to capture antigen. Assume monovalent binding between antigen and B cell receptor (BCR), rapid binding relative to cellular processes, a well-mixed compartment, and that antigen is not appreciably depleted by binding. Let the reversible binding reaction be described by the law of mass action, with the dissociation constant defined by $K_{d} = \\frac{[B][A]}{[BA]}$. The fraction of BCR molecules occupied at equilibrium is determined by this binding.\n\nDefine the total effective capture capacity of a B cell pool $i$ ($i \\in \\{\\text{memory}, \\text{naive}\\}$) as proportional to its total number of available binding sites, its encounter rate, and its fractional occupancy, aggregated into a single pool-specific scaling factor $S_{i}$ that multiplies the equilibrium occupancy. Thus, the instantaneous antigen capture by pool $i$ at antigen concentration $A$ is proportional to $S_{i}$ times the equilibrium fraction of occupied sites determined by $K_{d,i}$.\n\nStarting from these definitions and assumptions, derive an explicit expression for the antigen concentration $A_{\\ast}$ at which the total antigen captured by the memory and naive pools is equal.

We shall proceed with its formal solution.\n\nThe first step is to establish an expression for the fractional occupancy of B cell receptors (BCRs) at equilibrium. A B cell receptor, denoted $B$, binds to an antigen, denoted $A$, to form a complex $BA$. The reversible reaction is $B + A \\rightleftharpoons BA$. The dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action at equilibrium:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[B][A]}{[BA]}$$\nwhere $[B]$ is the concentration of free receptors, $[A]$ is the concentration of free antigen, and $[BA]$ is the concentration of receptor-antigen complexes.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is the ratio of the concentration of occupied receptors to the total concentration of receptors, $[B]_{\\text{total}}$. The total receptor concentration is the sum of free and bound receptors: $[B]_{\\text{total}} = [B] + [BA]$.\nThus, the fractional occupancy is:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[BA]}{[B]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[BA]}{[B] + [BA]}$$\nFrom the definition of $K_d$, we can express the concentration of free receptors as $[B] = \\frac{K_d [BA]}{[A]}$. Substituting this into the denominator of the expression for $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[BA]}{\\frac{K_d [BA]}{[A]} + [BA]}$$\nAssuming a non-zero concentration of complexes, $[BA] \\neq 0$, we can divide the numerator and denominator by $[BA]$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[A]} + 1} = \\frac{[A]}{K_d + [A]}$$\nThis is the standard Hill-Langmuir equation for monovalent binding, which describes the fractional occupancy as a function of antigen concentration and the dissociation constant. The problem states that the antigen concentration, denoted simply as $A$, is not appreciably depleted, so we use $A$ for $[A]$.\n\nThe problem defines the instantaneous antigen capture by a B cell pool $i$ (where $i$ can be memory, 'm', or naive, 'n'), denoted $C_i$, to be proportional to a pool-specific scaling factor $S_i$ and the fractional occupancy $\\theta_i$.

The optimal analytical design must be able to detect this preferential recall while being robust to several specified confounders and making use of available control data.\n\nThe requirements for a valid analytical design, as detailed in the problem statement, are:\n1.

First, the total escape score $\\sum_{i} s_{i}$ is a proxy for the total binding inhibitory activity of the serum. An increase in this sum after a booster ($t=1$ vs. $t=0$) is expected simply due to an increase in total antibody titer, a phenomenon known as an anamnestic response. This method does not normalize for this global titer effect and thus cannot distinguish a change in the *specificity* of the response from a simple increase in its *magnitude*. Second, it sums over all sites $i$, not just those in the original epitope footprint $S_{\\text{orig}}$. Concluding an enrichment specifically within $S_{\\text{orig}}$ from a change in the global sum is a logical non sequitur; the increase could be driven by sites entirely outside of $S_{\\text{orig}}$.

Map the enriched sites onto structure to verify spatial contiguity of the footprint and lack of comparable enrichment in $S_{\\text{other}}$.**\n\nThis design is methodologically sound and comprehensive.\n1.  **Normalization**: The $L^{1}$ normalization, $\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}^{(t)}=\\mathbf{s}^{(t)}/\\sum_{i}s_{i}^{(t)}$, converts the raw escape scores into a relative score or proportion for each site. This effectively controls for the global titer, as a uniform scaling of all $s_{i}^{(t)}$ by a constant factor will not change the normalized profile $\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}^{(t)}$. This addresses the titer confounder.\n2.  **Hypothesis Test**: The statistic being tested is the change in the *proportion* of the total escape signal that falls within the original epitope, $\\sum_{i\\in S_{\\text{orig}}}\\tilde{s}_{i}^{(1)}-\\sum_{i\\in S_{\\text{orig}}}\\tilde{s}_{i}^{(0)}$. This directly quantifies the shift in polyclonal antibody specificity towards the original footprint, which is the central claim of the imprinting hypothesis. It properly uses the pre-boost data as a baseline.\n3.  **Control for Site-Specific Confounders**: The use of a null distribution generated from site sets matched by size, surface exposure ($M$), and mutational tolerance ($\\tau_{i}$) is a critical and sophisticated control. It ensures that any observed enrichment in $S_{\\text{orig}}$ is not simply because the sites in $S_{\\text{orig}}$ are, for example, intrinsically more tolerant to mutations. This robustly controls for known site-specific confounders.\n4.  **Control for Naive Response**: The requirement that the same enrichment is not observed in the naive control group ($\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}^{(1,\\text{naive})}$) is essential. It isolates the effect as being specific to the recall of a pre-existing memory response, distinguishing it from a de novo response that might incidentally target some sites in $S_{\\text{orig}}$.\n5.  **Further Validation**: The final checks for spatial contiguity and lack of enrichment in $S_{\\text{other}}$ (epitopes specific to strain $Y$) provide powerful orthogonal validation of the finding.\nThis method correctly addresses all the requirements for a rigorous test of the hypothesis.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Compute the antigenic distance $d$ between strains $X$ and $Y$ as the Hamming distance in amino-acid sequence, and correlate $d$ with $\\sum_{i\\in S_{\\text{orig}}} s_{i}^{(1)}$ across individuals. A positive correlation indicates imprinting because larger $d$ should recall original specificities more strongly.**\n\nThis proposal is fundamentally flawed. The antigenic distance $d$ between the priming strain $X$ and the booster strain $Y$ is a fixed constant for all individuals in the experiment. One cannot compute a correlation between a variable (the escape sum, which varies across individuals) and a constant ($d$). The proposed statistical analysis is therefore impossible. Moreover, this method uses the raw sum of escape scores, failing to control for titer, and it neglects to use the pre-boost baseline or the naive control data.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Identify the single most escaped site post-boost, $i^{\\star}=\\arg\\max_{i} s_{i}^{(1)}$, and if $i^{\\star}\\in S_{\\text{orig}}$, declare imprinting; otherwise, reject imprinting. This avoids normalization and addresses heterogeneity by focusing on the dominant site.**\n\nThis is a drastic oversimplification. An epitope is a surface patch typically composed of multiple amino acid sites. Reducing the entire polyclonal response to a single \"winner-take-all\" site discards the vast majority of the data and ignores the distributed nature of an epitope. This approach is not robust and is highly susceptible to noise; the single maximum site could be an outlier due to measurement error or high intrinsic mutational tolerance ($\\tau_i$). The claim that avoiding normalization is a benefit is false; this method remains confounded by titer and site-specific properties. It also fails to incorporate the baseline and naive control data, making any conclusion unreliable.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Compute the cosine similarity between $\\mathbf{s}^{(1)}$ and an indicator vector $\\mathbf{1}_{S_{\\text{orig}}}$ and accept imprinting if the similarity increases from $t=0$ to $t=1$, without further controls, because cosine similarity removes titer dependence by construction.**\n\nThis method has some merits but also critical deficiencies. Computing cosine similarity, $\\text{sim}(\\mathbf{s}, \\mathbf{v}) = (\\mathbf{s} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) / (\\|\\mathbf{s}\\|_{2} \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_{2})$, does indeed control for the magnitude of the vectors, providing a form of normalization against titer effects. By comparing the similarity at $t=1$ versus $t=0$, it correctly uses the pre-boost data as a baseline. However, its major failings are stated in its description: \"without further controls\". It fails to control for site-specific properties like mutational tolerance, $\\tau_i$. If sites within $S_{\\text{orig}}$ just happen to be highly tolerant to mutation, they could have high $s_i$ values for reasons unrelated to antibody targeting, which would artifactually inflate the cosine similarity. Most importantly, it completely ignores the naive control group data ($s_{i}^{(1, \\text{naive})}$). Without this control, one cannot determine if an increased focus on $S_{\\text{orig}}$ is a specific feature of memory recall or a general feature of any immune response to strain $Y$. The methodology in option B is superior because it explicitly controls for both of these critical factors.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2856763"}]}
