Annotate TRM as clusters with high CCR7, S1PR1, and KLF2 mRNA, low CD69 protein, and central memory features; validate by confirming high CD62L protein in CITE-seq and high TCR clone sharing between tissue and blood.

Annotate TRM as clusters with coherent upregulation of ZNF683, PRDM1, and RUNX3 and downregulation of KLF2, S1PR1, and CCR7 mRNA, plus tissue-context markers (epithelial: ITGAE; parenchymal: ITGA1 with CXCR6); optionally enriched effector cytokine readiness (e.g., interferon gamma pathway). Validate by CITE-seq protein showing high CD69 and either CD103 or CD49a with CXCR6, low CCR7 and S1PR1; quantitative enrichment in the tissue hashtag by more than 80% and log$_2$ fold-enrichment greater than 1 relative to blood; minimal TCR clonotype sharing with blood quantified by a Jaccard index less than 0.1; and orthogonal immunofluorescence showing CD69/CD103 T cells localized to E-cadherin$^+$ regions in the tissue.\n\nD.

A correct strategy will integrate transcriptional programs, protein expression, tissue localization, and clonal data in a coherent manner.\n\n**A.** This option describes a *recirculating* central memory T cell, not a TRM. High expression of KLF2, S1PR1, and CCR7 promotes tissue egress and circulation, which is the opposite of residency. The validation criteria (high CD62L and high clonal sharing with blood) also confirm a circulating phenotype. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**B.** This profile describes a circulating cytotoxic effector cell (e.g., Temra), not necessarily a TRM. While some TRM are cytotoxic, this is not their defining feature. Critically, the validation criterion of equal representation in tissue and blood is antithetical to the concept of residency. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**C.** This option provides a comprehensive and accurate definition. It correctly identifies the key transcriptional program (high ZNF683/PRDM1, low KLF2/S1PR1/CCR7), the protein phenotype (high CD69/CD103, low CCR7), the expected tissue enrichment (based on hashtags), and the clonal restriction (low sharing with blood, based on TCR-seq). It proposes a multi-modal validation strategy that is rigorous and directly tests the core hypotheses of tissue residency. The mention of orthogonal spatial validation with immunofluorescence is a hallmark of a gold-standard approach. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\n**D.** This option focuses on metabolic markers that are not specific to TRM and can be found in many activated or stressed cell types. It incorrectly ignores the defining markers of tissue egress and residency, making the strategy unreliable. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**E.** This strategy is based on weak premises.
