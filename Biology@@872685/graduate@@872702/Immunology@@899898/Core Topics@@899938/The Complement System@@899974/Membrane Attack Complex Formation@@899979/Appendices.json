We can express this as $R = k \\cdot [C5]_{\\text{free}}$, where $k$ is a proportionality constant. The problem asks for the ratio of the rate with the drug to the rate without the drug.\n$$\n\\text{Fraction} = \\frac{R_{\\text{with drug}}}{R_{\\text{without drug}}} = \\frac{k \\cdot [C5]_{\\text{free, with drug}}}{k \\cdot [C5]_{\\text{free, without drug}}} = \\frac{[C5]_{\\text{free, with drug}}}{[C5]_{\\text{free, without drug}}}\n$$\nIn the absence of the drug, all C5 is free. Therefore, $[C5]_{\\text{free, without drug}} = C_{T}$.\n$$\n\\text{Fraction} = \\frac{[C5]_{\\text{free, with drug}}}{C_{T}}\n$$\nThe primary task is to calculate the concentration of free C5 at equilibrium in the presence of the drug, $[C5]_{\\text{free, with drug}}$. Let us denote the equilibrium concentrations of free C5, free drug, and the C5-drug complex as $[C]_{\\text{free}}$, $[D]_{\\text{free}}$, and $[CD]$, respectively.\n\nThe equilibrium is governed by three equations:\n1.  Conservation of total C5: $C_{T} = [C]_{\\text{free}} + [CD]$\n2.  Conservation of total drug: $D_{T} = [D]_{\\text{free}} + [CD]$\n3.  The law of mass action for dissociation: $K_{D} = \\frac{[C]_{\\text{free}}[D]_{\\text{free}}}{[CD]}$\n\nFrom equation (1), we express the complex concentration as:\n$$\n[CD] = C_{T} - [C]_{\\text{free}}\n$$\nFrom equation (2), we express the free drug concentration as:\n$$\n[D]_{\\text{free}} = D_{T} - [CD] = D_{T} - (C_{T} - [C]_{\\text{free}}) = D_{T} - C_{T} + [C]_{\\text{free}}\n$$\nNow, substitute these expressions for $[CD]$ and $[D]_{\\text{free}}$ into the equilibrium equation (3):\n$$\nK_{D} = \\frac{[C]_{\\text{free}} (D_{T} - C_{T} + [C]_{\\text{free}})}{C_{T} - [C]_{\\text{free}}}\n$$\nFor simplicity, let $y = [C]_{\\text{free}}$.

The term under the square root is strictly positive. The term $(D_{T} - C_{T} + K_{D})$ is also positive. The square root term, $\\sqrt{(D_{T} - C_{T} + K_{D})^2 + 4 K_{D} C_{T}}$, is strictly greater than $|D_{T} - C_{T} + K_{D}|$. Therefore, to ensure $y > 0$, we must select the positive root.\n$$\ny = \\frac{-(D_{T} - C_{T} + K_{D}) + \\sqrt{(D_{T} - C_{T} + K_{D})^2 + 4 K_{D} C_{T}}}{2}\n$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values: $C_{T} = 80$ nM, $D_{T} = 200$ nM, and $K_{D} = 0.5$ nM.\nFirst, calculate the coefficients of the quadratic equation:\n$$\nb = D_{T} - C_{T} + K_{D} = 200 - 80 + 0.5 = 120.5 \\text{ (in nM)}\n$$\n$$\nc = -K_{D} C_{T} = -(0.5)(80) = -40 \\text{ (in nM}^2\\text{)}\n$$\nThe equation is $y^2 + 120.5 y - 40 = 0$.\nNow, solve for $y$:\n$$\ny = \\frac{-120.5 + \\sqrt{(120.5)^2 - 4(1)(-40)}}{2}\n$$\n$$\ny = \\frac{-120.5 + \\sqrt{14520.25 + 160}}{2}\n$$\n$$\ny = \\frac{-120.5 + \\sqrt{14680.25}}{2}\n$$\nThe square root is $\\sqrt{14680.25} \\approx 121.162082$.\n$$\ny \\approx \\frac{-120.5 + 121.162082}{2} = \\frac{0.662082}{2} = 0.331041 \\text{ nM}\n$$\nSo, $[C5]_{\\text{free, with drug}} \\approx 0.331041$ nM.\nThe required fraction is:\n$$\n\\text{Fraction} = \\frac{[C5]_{\\text{free, with drug}}}{C_{T}} = \\frac{0.331041 \\text{ nM}}{80 \\text{ nM}} \\approx 0.0041380125\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\text{Fraction} \\approx 0.004138\n$$\nThis result indicates that the presence of the drug at the specified concentration reduces the MAC formation rate to approximately $0.4138\\%$ of its original value.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.004138}\n$$", "id": "2868425"}, {"introduction": "Successful MAC assembly hinges on a precise sequence of conformational changes and protein-membrane interactions.

The question is objective and answerable through logical deduction based on the provided information.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem provides all necessary information to solve it. It states that the mutant C8 binds C5b-7, which is a crucial piece of information. The provided facts are internally consistent and consistent with established scientific knowledge.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically valid, well-posed, and internally consistent. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe formation of the lytic Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) is a sequential process.\n$1$. The C5b-7 complex forms and, as stated in fact (ii), associates with the target cell membrane. This association is initially superficial and does not constitute a pore.\n$2$. The C8 heterotrimer, composed of C8α, C8β, and C8γ subunits, binds to the C5b-7 complex. The problem states this binding occurs with normal affinity for the mutant C8.\n$3$. According to fact (iii), the function of C8 is to *initiate membrane penetration*. This is a critical, energy-dependent step. The hydrophobic membrane-inserting helices of the MACPF domains within the C8α and C8β subunits undergo a conformational change and insert into the lipid bilayer. This process overcomes the substantial free-energy barrier, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$, for inserting a hydrophilic protein structure into a hydrophobic environment. This initial insertion creates a small, stable, transmembrane defect.\n$4$. Fact (iv) states that C9 monomers polymerize on a *membrane-inserted* C5b-8 complex to form the final, larger pore. The proper insertion of C8 is therefore the structural and energetic prerequisite for the nucleation of C9 polymerization.\n\nNow, we analyze the consequences of the specified mutation. The mutation deletes the hydrophobic membrane-inserting helix of the C8α subunit. This is a critical loss-of-function mutation. While the mutant C8 can still bind to C5b-7 on the membrane, its ability to perform its primary function—initiating membrane penetration—is severely compromised. The C8α subunit is a principal contributor to this insertion event. Without its hydrophobic helix, the C8 complex cannot properly insert into the lipid bilayer. The energy barrier $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ for creating a stable transmembrane structure will not be overcome. The resulting C5b-8 complex will remain a peripheral membrane protein complex, a \"pre-pore,\" rather than an integral, transmembrane one.\n\nBecause the C5b-8 complex is not properly membrane-inserted, it cannot serve as an effective template for C9 polymerization, as required by fact (iv). The specific conformation of the inserted C8 subunits is what nucleates the polymerization of C9. Without this template, C9 monomers cannot be properly recruited, unfolded, and polymerized into the final pore structure.\n\nConclusion: The cascade is arrested at the C5b-8 stage. No transmembrane pore is formed. According to fact (i), a bona fide transmembrane pore is required for lysis. Therefore, lytic activity must be essentially abolished.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. Lytic activity is essentially abolished, because loss of the C8α membrane-inserting helix prevents initial membrane penetration and proper nucleation of C9 polymerization, so the complex remains a non-transmembrane pre-pore.\nThis statement is a precise summary of the derived consequences. The deletion of the helix prevents insertion, which in turn prevents C9 nucleation. Without a C9 pore, there is no lysis. The final state is a non-functional pre-pore complex. This reasoning is sound and directly follows from the provided facts. **Correct**.\n\nB. Lytic activity is modestly reduced (to roughly $20$–$30\\%$ of normal), because C8β and C8γ can partially compensate for insertion and still recruit enough C9 to form functional pores.\nThis is incorrect. First, C8γ does not possess a MACPF domain and is not involved in insertion in the same manner as C8α and C8β. Second, while C8β does have an inserting helix, the proper nucleation of C9 depends on the correctly formed C5b-8 transmembrane structure, to which both C8α and C8β contribute. The loss of the C8α helix is a critical defect that would destabilize the entire inserted structure, making it a very poor, if not entirely non-functional, template for C9. A mere \"modest reduction\" is highly improbable for such a critical structural defect. The outcome should be catastrophic failure, not partial function. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Lytic activity is near-normal, because C5b-7 can directly recruit and polymerize C9 without requiring membrane insertion by C8α.\nThis statement contradicts the provided facts. Fact (iii) and (iv) establish a strict sequence: C5b-7 binds C8, which then inserts, and only then does the resulting C5b-8 complex recruit C9. There is no known direct pathway from C5b-7 to C9 polymerization. The problem even states that the mutant C8 binds to C5b-7, meaning the C5b-8 complex does form, precluding any hypothetical bypass. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Lytic activity is increased, because removal of the C8α helix eliminates an autoinhibitory element and leads to hyperactive C9 polymerization on the membrane surface without the need for insertion.\nThis is biologically and physically nonsensical. The hydrophobic helix is a functional element required for insertion, not an autoinhibitory one. A gain-of-function (increased activity) from deleting a critical functional domain is illogical. Furthermore, polymerization \"on the membrane surface\" without insertion would not create a transmembrane pore, which fact (i) specifies is necessary for lysis. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2868397"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate function of the MAC is to create a stable, lytic pore in the target membrane, leading to osmotic collapse.
