This is a classic problem in chemical kinetics and probability theory, specifically involving competing first-order processes.\n\nLet us define the state of the system. The convertase C3bBb can exist in two states before dissociation:\n1. Unbound state ($C$): The initial state of the C3bBb molecule, which is not bound to FH.\n2. FH-bound state ($C_{FH}$): The C3bBb molecule after it has bound a molecule of FH.\n\nFrom the unbound state $C$, there are two possible transitions, which are competing first-order processes:\n- Spontaneous dissociation: $C \\xrightarrow{k_0} \\text{Products}$.

The time $t_1$ spent in the unbound state is an exponentially distributed random variable with a mean of $1/(k_0 + k_b)$.\n\nOnce FH binds, the convertase enters the bound state $C_{FH}$.

We can compute this using the law of total expectation, conditioning on the outcome of the first event starting from state $C$.\n\nThe probability that the first event is spontaneous dissociation is the ratio of its rate to the total exit rate:\n$$p_{diss} = \\frac{k_0}{k_0 + k_b}$$\nThe probability that the first event is FH binding is:\n$$p_{bind} = \\frac{k_b}{k_0 + k_b}$$\nNote that $p_{diss} + p_{bind} = 1$.\n\nIf the convertase dissociates spontaneously (Path 1), its lifetime is simply the time $t_1$ it spent in the unbound state.

The expected time in the unbound state is $E[t_1] = 1/(k_0+k_b)$. The time $t_2$ in the FH-bound state follows an exponential distribution with rate $2k_0$, so its expectation is $E[t_2] = 1/(2k_0)$.
