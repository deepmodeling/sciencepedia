This problem challenges you to predict the downstream consequences of a mutation that prevents the oligomerization of the key scaffold protein CARD11. By carefully applying the principles of the T cell receptor signaling cascade [@problem_id:2857628], you'll clarify the specific role of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex in activating NF-κB, while appreciating the parallel and independent activation of NFAT and AP-1.", "problem": "A T cell line is engineered to express only a mutant form of caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 11 (CARD11) in which the coiled-coil domain cannot oligomerize upon T cell receptor (TCR) engagement. You stimulate these cells via TCR with appropriate co-stimulation and assess the following readouts: (i) B cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) higher-order assembly by live-cell imaging; (ii) mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) protease activation; (iii) IκB kinase (IKK) activation and inhibitor of κB alpha (IκBα) phosphorylation/degradation; (iv) nuclear translocation of Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB); and, in parallel, (v) activation of Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT) and Activator Protein 1 (AP-1). As orthogonal stimuli, you also test phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin. \n\nUse the following as foundational principles without assuming the outcome: TCR signaling engages proximal tyrosine kinases to assemble the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) and SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76) scaffold, activating phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-γ1). PLC-γ1 generates diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which elevate cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$. DAG activates Protein Kinase C-theta (PKC-θ), which phosphorylates CARD11 to enable its coiled-coil mediated oligomerization. Oligomerized CARD11 nucleates the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex by seeding BCL10 filament assembly, thereby recruiting Tumor Necrosis Factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and TGF-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1) to activate IKK, leading to IκBα phosphorylation, IκBα degradation, and NF-κB nuclear translocation. In parallel, calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT in response to $Ca^{2+}$, and DAG/Ras–Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling induces AP-1. PMA mimics DAG to activate PKC-θ and RasGRP, while ionomycin elevates $Ca^{2+}$.\n\nWhich option best predicts the signaling phenotype of the CARD11 coiled-coil oligomerization-defective mutant T cells upon TCR stimulation and pharmacologic stimulation?\n\nA. TCR stimulation yields BCL10 puncta that fail to elongate into filaments; MALT1 protease activity and IKK activation are severely impaired; IκBα is not phosphorylated or degraded, and NF-κB nuclear translocation is lost. NFAT and AP-1 activation remain near normal because calcineurin and MAPK pathways are intact. PMA fails to rescue NF-κB, whereas ionomycin rescues NFAT.\n\nB. BCL10 filament assembly proceeds normally because BCL10 self-polymerizes independently of CARD11; IKK activation is only modestly reduced and NF-κB nuclear translocation proceeds. PMA fully rescues any remaining deficit.\n\nC. The primary defect is loss of NFAT activation because CARD11 oligomerization is required to couple $Ca^{2+}$ to calcineurin; NF-κB and AP-1 remain largely intact due to compensatory TRAF6 activity.\n\nD. IκBα phosphorylation after TCR stimulation is normal, but its degradation fails due to mutant CARD11 impairing proteasome function; BCL10 filaments form normally.\n\nE. BCL10 forms short filaments that are sufficient to delay, but not prevent, IKK activation; NF-κB translocation occurs with prolonged kinetics, and both NFAT and AP-1 are substantially diminished due to loss of LAT and SLP-76 phosphorylation downstream of the CARD11 mutation.", "solution": "The problem statement is parsed and validated. The givens are self-contained, scientifically grounded in the field of immunology, and logically consistent. The problem asks for the predicted signaling phenotype of a T cell line with a specific mutation in the context of a well-defined signaling pathway. The problem is valid. We proceed to the derivation of the solution.\n\nThe foundational principles provided describe the signaling cascade initiated by T cell receptor (TCR) engagement. We must rigorously trace the consequences of the specified mutation—the inability of the caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 11 (`CARD11`) to oligomerize via its coiled-coil domain—through this cascade.\n\n**Analysis of the Signaling Pathway with the Mutant `CARD11`**\n\nThe provided principles delineate three major transcription factor activation pathways downstream of TCR engagement: Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (`NF-κB`), Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (`NFAT`), and Activator Protein 1 (`AP-1`). We analyze each in the context of the mutation.\n\n1.  **Proximal Signaling (Upstream of `CARD11`):**\n    According to the principles, TCR engagement leads to the assembly of the Linker for Activation of T cells (LAT) and SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76) scaffold, which activates phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-γ1). This enzyme hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into two second messengers: diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ($\\text{IP}_3$). The mutation in `CARD11` is downstream of these events. Therefore, the generation of DAG and $\\text{IP}_3$ upon TCR stimulation is expected to be normal.\n\n2.  **The `NFAT` and `AP-1` Pathways:**\n    The principles state that the `NFAT` and `AP-1` pathways operate \"in parallel\" to the `NF-κB` pathway.\n    -   **`NFAT` Activation:** $\\text{IP}_3$ triggers an elevation in cytosolic calcium concentration ($Ca^{2+}$). This increase in $Ca^{2+}$ activates the phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylates `NFAT`, leading to its nuclear translocation and activation. Since $\\text{IP}_3$ generation is normal, the `NFAT` pathway is unaffected by the `CARD11` mutation.\n    -   **`AP-1` Activation:** DAG, in concert with Ras–Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling, induces `AP-1`. Since DAG generation is normal, the `AP-1` pathway is also expected to be intact and function normally.\n\n3.  **The `NF-κB` Pathway:**\n    This is the pathway directly affected by the mutation.\n    -   DAG activates Protein Kinase C-theta (PKC-θ).\n    -   PKC-θ then phosphorylates `CARD11`. This phosphorylation is a prerequisite for `CARD11` oligomerization. This step should occur normally.\n    -   The next step is coiled-coil mediated oligomerization of `CARD11`. The problem statement explicitly defines the mutation as preventing this step: \"the coiled-coil domain cannot oligomerize\".\n    -   According to the principles, \"Oligomerized `CARD11` nucleates the `CARD11`–B cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (`BCL10`)–mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (`MALT1`) (CBM) complex by seeding `BCL10` filament assembly.\"\n    -   Since `CARD11` cannot oligomerize, it cannot serve as a seed or scaffold for `BCL10` filament assembly. Consequently, readout (i), `BCL10` higher-order assembly, will be abolished.\n    -   The failure to form the CBM complex means that readout (ii), `MALT1` protease activation (an intrinsic property of the complex), will be lost.\n    -   The assembled CBM complex is required to recruit Tumor Necrosis Factor receptor-associated factor 6 (`TRAF6`) and TGF-β activated kinase 1 (`TAK1`) to activate the IκB kinase (`IKK`) complex. Without the CBM complex, `IKK` will not be activated.\n    -   Therefore, readout (iii), `IKK` activation, is lost. As a consequence, phosphorylation of the inhibitor of κB alpha (`IκBα`) by `IKK` will not occur, and subsequent ubiquitination-dependent degradation of `IκBα` will be blocked.\n    -   Finally, because `IκBα` remains intact and bound to `NF-κB` in the cytoplasm, readout (iv), the nuclear translocation of `NF-κB`, is completely abrogated.\n\n**Analysis of Pharmacologic Stimulation**\n\n-   **Ionomycin:** This is a $Ca^{2+}$ ionophore that directly increases cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$, bypassing all upstream membrane-proximal signaling. This will directly activate calcineurin and lead to `NFAT` activation, confirming the integrity of this downstream pathway.\n-   **Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA):** This is a DAG mimetic. It activates PKC-θ and RasGRP. Activation of PKC-θ will result in phosphorylation of the mutant `CARD11`, but this does not circumvent the oligomerization defect. Therefore, PMA cannot rescue the block in the `NF-κB` pathway. It will, however, contribute to `AP-1` activation via RasGRP and the MAPK pathway.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:**\n-   **TCR stimulation:** Intact `NFAT` and `AP-1` activation. Complete block of the `NF-κB` pathway, evidenced by lack of `BCL10` assembly, no `MALT1` or `IKK` activation, stable `IκBα`, and no `NF-κB` nuclear translocation.\n-   **PMA + Ionomycin stimulation:** PMA will fail to activate `NF-κB`. Ionomycin will activate `NFAT`. Together, they will activate `AP-1` and `NFAT`, but not `NF-κB`.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n-   **A. TCR stimulation yields BCL10 puncta that fail to elongate into filaments; MALT1 protease activity and IKK activation are severely impaired; IκBα is not phosphorylated or degraded, and NF-κB nuclear translocation is lost. NFAT and AP-1 activation remain near normal because calcineurin and MAPK pathways are intact. PMA fails to rescue NF-κB, whereas ionomycin rescues NFAT.**\n    This option aligns perfectly with our derivation. The failure of `CARD11` oligomerization prevents it from seeding `BCL10` filaments. \"Puncta that fail to elongate\" is a correct biophysical description for the failure of filament assembly. The downstream consequences for `MALT1`, `IKK`, `IκBα`, and `NF-κB` are all correctly stated as being lost or severely impaired. It correctly identifies that the parallel `NFAT` and `AP-1` pathways are intact. Finally, it correctly predicts the outcomes of pharmacologic stimulation.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **B. BCL10 filament assembly proceeds normally because BCL10 self-polymerizes independently of CARD11; IKK activation is only modestly reduced and NF-κB nuclear translocation proceeds. PMA fully rescues any remaining deficit.**\n    This option contradicts a central tenet provided: that oligomerized `CARD11` seeds `BCL10` filament assembly. If `BCL10` self-polymerized independently, the CBM complex would not be dependent on `CARD11` oligomerization. The downstream conclusions are therefore also incorrect. PMA cannot rescue a defect downstream of its point of action.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. The primary defect is loss of NFAT activation because CARD11 oligomerization is required to couple $Ca^{2+}$ to calcineurin; NF-κB and AP-1 remain largely intact due to compensatory TRAF6 activity.**\n    This option misidentifies both the affected pathway and the mechanism. The principles clearly separate the `NF-κB` pathway (dependent on `CARD11`) from the `NFAT` pathway (dependent on $Ca^{2+}$). There is no stated mechanistic link between `CARD11` oligomerization and calcineurin. The claim that `NF-κB` remains intact is the opposite of the correct conclusion.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. IκBα phosphorylation after TCR stimulation is normal, but its degradation fails due to mutant CARD11 impairing proteasome function; BCL10 filaments form normally.**\n    This option contains multiple errors. `IκBα` phosphorylation is mediated by `IKK`, which will be inactive. Thus, phosphorylation will not be normal. The claim that mutant `CARD11` impairs proteasome function is an unsupported invention; the failure of degradation is a consequence of the lack of phosphorylation, which is the signal for proteasomal targeting. The assertion that `BCL10` filaments form normally is also incorrect.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **E. BCL10 forms short filaments that are sufficient to delay, but not prevent, IKK activation; NF-κB translocation occurs with prolonged kinetics, and both NFAT and AP-1 are substantially diminished due to loss of LAT and SLP-76 phosphorylation downstream of the CARD11 mutation.**\n    This option reverses the order of the pathway. `CARD11` is downstream of LAT and SLP-76, not upstream. A mutation in `CARD11` cannot affect upstream phosphorylation events on LAT/SLP-76. Therefore, the claim that `NFAT` and `AP-1` are diminished for this reason is based on a false premise. While a hypomorphic mutation might lead to a \"delay\" rather than a complete block, the description \"cannot oligomerize\" implies a null-function phenotype, and more importantly, the reasoning for the effect on `NFAT`/`AP-1` is fundamentally wrong.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on rigorous deduction from the provided foundational principles, only option A accurately describes the signaling phenotype.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2857628"}, {"introduction": "The activation of a T cell is a complex decision, not a simple reflex, that depends on the integration of multiple signals. This practice problem explores the molecular basis of T cell anergy, a state of functional unresponsiveness critical for preventing autoimmunity.

Cells are stimulated with weak T cell receptor (TCR) ligation in the absence of CD28 costimulation. Assume the following foundational immunobiology:\n\n- TCR engagement activates phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC-γ1), producing inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ($\\text{IP}_3$) and diacylglycerol (DAG). $\\text{IP}_3$ raises cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$ to activate calcineurin, which dephosphorylates nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), enabling its nuclear entry. DAG activates Ras via RasGRP to drive the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and induce activator protein 1 (AP-1), and also activates protein kinase C-θ (PKC-θ) to assemble the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 complex, leading to IκB kinase activation and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) nuclear translocation.\n- Many effector cytokine promoters and enhancers, such as those of interleukin-2 (Il2) and interferon-γ (Ifng), contain composite sites that require cooperative binding by NFAT and AP-1 for robust transcriptional activation.

All givens are extracted, and the problem is determined to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It provides a sufficient basis of established immunological principles to derive a unique and logical conclusion. Therefore, we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a prediction of the cellular state based on a specific genetic modification and stimulation condition. The analysis must proceed strictly from the provided \"foundational immunobiology\".\n\nLet us analyze the state of the key transcription factors in the nucleus of the engineered CD$4^{+}$ T cell under the specified conditions.\n\n1.  **Stimulation Conditions**: The cells receive weak T cell receptor (TCR) ligation in the absence of CD28 costimulation. According to the problem statement, this type of stimulation is characterized by minimal production of diacylglycerol (DAG).\n\n2.  **Activation of Signaling Pathways**:\n    *   **DAG-dependent pathways**: Since DAG production is minimal, the downstream pathways are weakly activated. This includes:\n        *   The Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which is responsible for inducing activator protein 1 (AP-1). Consequently, nuclear AP-1 levels will be low.\n        *   The protein kinase C-θ (PKC-θ) pathway, which leads to the assembly of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 complex and subsequent activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB). Consequently, nuclear NF-κB levels will be low.\n    *   **$Ca^{2+}$-dependent pathway**: Weak TCR ligation will generate some inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ($\\text{IP}_3$), leading to a rise in cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$ and some activation of calcineurin. However, for the engineered cell, this pathway is bypassed with respect to nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) localization.\n\n3.  **State of Nuclear Transcription Factors**:\n    *   **NFAT**: The cells express a mutant form of NFATc1 that is constitutively dephosphorylated and nuclear, independent of $Ca^{2+}$/calcineurin signaling. Therefore, there will be a high and sustained level of NFATc1 in the nucleus.\n    *   **AP-1**: As derived above, nuclear levels of AP-1 will be low.\n    *   **NF-κB**: As derived above, nuclear levels of NF-κB will be low.\n\nWe are therefore presented with a specific intracellular state: high nuclear NFAT in the context of low nuclear AP-1 and NF-κB. We must now predict the transcriptional and functional consequences.\n\n*   **Effector Cytokine Production**: The problem states that robust transcription from the interleukin-2 (`Il2`) and interferon-γ (`Ifng`) gene loci requires *cooperative binding by NFAT and AP-1*. Since AP-1 is limiting, the high concentration of nuclear NFAT is insufficient to drive robust transcription of these genes. Production of IL-2 and IFN-γ will be low or absent.\n\n*   **Anergy-Associated Gene Expression**: The signaling signature of high nuclear NFAT with low AP-1 is the canonical trigger for the induction of a T cell anergy program. In the absence of its cooperative partner AP-1, NFAT binds to different promoter sites and activates a distinct set of genes. These genes encode proteins that actively suppress T cell responses, including the E3 ubiquitin ligases Cbl-b and Rnf128 (Grail), and transcription factors like early growth response proteins Egr2 and Egr3. Therefore, the expression of these anergy-associated regulators will be strongly upregulated.\n\n*   **Proliferative Capacity**: The problem states that productive proliferation correlates with interleukin-2 production and sufficient NF-κB activity. Since both `Il2` production and NF-κB activity are low, the cells will be hypoproliferative upon this primary stimulation. The induction of anergy-associated factors like Cbl-b and Grail, which target and degrade key signaling molecules, will establish a state of unresponsiveness (anergy), rendering the cells hypoproliferative upon subsequent restimulation.\n\nBased on this derivation, the expected phenotype is the upregulation of anergy-associated genes, a failure to produce effector cytokines, and a hypoproliferative, anergic state. We now evaluate the given options.\n\n**A. Anergy-associated genes (Egr2/Egr3, Rnf128, Cbl-b) are upregulated; interleukin-2 and interferon-γ remain low or absent; cells are hypoproliferative and exhibit anergy upon restimulation.**\nThis option perfectly matches the conclusions derived from the first principles provided. The imbalance between the NFAT signal and the AP-1/NF-κB signals correctly predicts the induction of anergy instead of effector function.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Robust interleukin-2 and interferon-γ are produced despite weak DAG signaling because nuclear NFATc1 alone is sufficient to activate composite cytokine promoters; anergy-associated genes are not induced.**\nThis statement directly contradicts a core premise of the problem: that robust activation of cytokine promoters for `Il2` and `Ifng` requires cooperative binding of NFAT and AP-1. The claim that NFAT alone is sufficient is false within the provided framework. Consequently, the conclusion that anergy genes are not induced is also incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. No significant change relative to wild-type cells under weak stimulation because AP-1 and NF-κB are limiting; constitutively nuclear NFATc1 cannot engage target DNA effectively without them.**\nThis option is flawed. While it correctly identifies that AP-1 and NF-κB are limiting for effector functions, it incorrectly concludes that NFATc1 cannot engage target DNA. NFATc1 will effectively engage the promoters of anergy-associated genes, leading to a profound change in phenotype compared to wild-type cells, which would have low nuclear NFAT under these conditions. The engineered cell will be driven strongly into anergy, a significant change.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Nuclear NFATc1 drives positive cross-talk that elevates NF-κB activity via the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 axis even without costimulation, restoring proliferation and interleukin-2 production.**\nThis proposes a mechanism of positive cross-talk from nuclear NFAT back to the upstream CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 signaling complex.

It is a standard, fundamental problem in biophysical chemistry applied to molecular immunology. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the definitions provided. The goal is to express the fractional occupancy, $f$, in terms of the free transcription factor concentration, $[T]$, and the dissociation constant, $K_d$.\n\nThe definition of fractional occupancy is:\n$$f = \\frac{[PT]}{[P]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$$\nThe total promoter concentration is the sum of the free and bound states:\n$$[P]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [P] + [PT]$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $f$ gives:\n$$f = \\frac{[PT]}{[P] + [PT]}$$\nTo proceed, we must eliminate $[P]$ and $[PT]$ in favor of the desired variables. We use the definition of the dissociation constant, $K_d$:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[P][T]}{[PT]}$$\nFrom this, we can express the concentration of the free promoter, $[P]$, in terms of the bound complex, $[PT]$, the free transcription factor, $[T]$, and $K_d$:\n$$[P] = \\frac{K_{d} [PT]}{[T]}$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[P]$ back into the equation for $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{[PT]}{\\left(\\frac{K_{d} [PT]}{[T]}\\right) + [PT]}$$\nThe term $[PT]$ is common to the numerator and both terms in the denominator. It can be factored out from the denominator and cancelled, provided that $[PT]$ is not zero (which would correspond to the trivial case of no binding):\n$$f = \\frac{[PT]}{[PT] \\left(\\frac{K_{d}}{[T]} + 1\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{d}}{[T]} + 1}$$\nThis expression can be simplified by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $[T]$:\n$$f = \\frac{1 \\cdot [T]}{(\\frac{K_{d}}{[T]} + 1) \\cdot [T]} = \\frac{[T]}{K_{d} + [T]}$$\nThis is the required derivation of $f$ as a function of $[T]$ and $K_d$. This is the Langmuir binding isotherm.\n\nNext, we evaluate $f$ for the given values: $K_d = 5$ nM and $[T] = 20$ nM. The assumption that the nuclear pool of the transcription factor is not appreciably depleted means that the free concentration, $[T]$, can be taken as equal to the total concentration provided.\n$$f = \\frac{20 \\text{ nM}}{5 \\text{ nM} + 20 \\text{ nM}}$$\nThe units of concentration (nM) cancel out, as expected for a dimensionless fractional quantity.\n$$f = \\frac{20}{25}$$\nConverting this fraction to an exact decimal gives:\n$$f = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8$$\nThe fractional occupancy of the κB site is $0.8$.\n\nFinally, the interpretation of this result is required. A fractional occupancy of $f = 0.8$ means that, at any given moment in time under these equilibrium conditions, there is an $80\\%$ probability that the promoter site is occupied by an NF-κB dimer. In a simple two-state promoter model where the promoter can be either \"OFF\" (unbound) or \"ON\" (bound), this value corresponds to the fraction of time the promoter spends in the \"ON\" state. If the rate of initiating a transcriptional burst is proportional to $f$, then a high occupancy of $0.8$ leads to a high frequency of transcriptional bursting. This high occupancy ensures that the promoter is frequently in a state competent for initiating transcription, which in turn results in a robust transcriptional output from the gene, assuming that downstream processes such as elongation are not rate-limiting.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8}$$", "id": "2857697"}]}
