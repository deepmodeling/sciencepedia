At the acidic pH of $6.0$ inside the endosome, the fractional occupancy is high ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0} = 0.8000$). This indicates that IgG molecules internalized into the endosome bind efficiently to FcRn. This binding sequesters the IgG, protecting it from the default pathway of lysosomal degradation. Upon trafficking of the FcRn-IgG complex back to the cell surface, the environment shifts to the neutral pH of $7.4$. At this pH, the binding affinity drops dramatically (as shown by the much larger $K_d$), resulting in a very low fractional occupancy ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{pH}\\,7.4} = 0.03846$). This causes the rapid dissociation and release of the IgG from FcRn back into the bloodstream. This pH-dependent cycle of binding and release is the precise mechanism by which FcRn salvages IgG from catabolism, thereby extending its circulatory half-life.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.8000 & 0.03846 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2875966"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the FcRn mechanism is not just an academic exercise; it is the basis for modern antibody engineering.

If $K_{d,WT}^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0}$ is the wild-type constant and $K_{d,Mut}^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0}$ is the mutant constant, then $K_{d,Mut}^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0} = K_{d,WT}^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0} / 5$.\n7.  **Mutation Effect (Neutral pH):** The dissociation constant at $\\mathrm{pH}\\,7.4$, denoted $K_d^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,7.4}$, remains unchanged. So, $K_{d,Mut}^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,7.4} = K_{d,WT}^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,7.4}$.\n8.  **Constant Parameters:** All other system parameters (endocytic rate, receptor abundance, etc.) are assumed to be constant.\n\n**Validation Verdict:**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, describing the established mechanism of FcRn-mediated IgG homeostasis. The provided binding equation is a standard model in biochemistry. The premises regarding the mutation's effects are specific, and the principles connecting binding to function (salvage and release) are biologically correct. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, with no contradictions or ambiguities. It is a valid problem in immunology and biophysical chemistry. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe serum half-life of IgG is primarily determined by the efficiency of the FcRn salvage pathway, which protects it from lysosomal degradation. This process involves two critical, pH-dependent steps: binding in the acidic endosome and release at the neutral pH of the cell surface.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the effect on binding at endosomal $\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0$.**\nThe problem states that the mutation causes the dissociation constant at $\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0$ to decrease $5$-fold: $K_{d,Mut}^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0} = K_{d,WT}^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0} / 5$.\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is an inverse measure of binding affinity; a smaller $K_d$ corresponds to a stronger binding interaction. Therefore, the mutation increases the binding affinity of IgG for FcRn at the acidic pH of the endosome.\n\nWe now examine the effect on receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, using the given formula: $\\theta = \\dfrac{[L]}{[L] + K_d}$.\nLet $[L_{endo}]$ be the concentration of free IgG in the endosome.\nThe occupancy for the wild-type IgG is $\\theta_{WT}^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0} = \\dfrac{[L_{endo}]}{[L_{endo}] + K_{d,WT}^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0}}$.\nThe occupancy for the mutant IgG is $\\theta_{Mut}^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0} = \\dfrac{[L_{endo}]}{[L_{endo}] + K_{d,Mut}^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0}} = \\dfrac{[L_{endo}]}{[L_{endo}] + (K_{d,WT}^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0}/5)}$.\n\nSince the denominator for the mutant, $[L_{endo}] + K_{d,WT}^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0}/5$, is smaller than the denominator for the wild-type, $[L_{endo}] + K_{d,WT}^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0}$, it follows that $\\theta_{Mut}^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0} > \\theta_{WT}^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0}$.\nThe problem states that salvage efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of occupancy at $\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0$. Since the mutation increases this occupancy, it must also **increase the salvage efficiency**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the effect on release at plasma $\\mathrm{pH}\\,7.4$.**\nThe problem states that the dissociation constant at $\\mathrm{pH}\\,7.4$ is unchanged by the mutation: $K_{d,Mut}^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,7.4} = K_{d,WT}^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,7.4}$.\nEfficient recycling requires the IgG to dissociate from FcRn upon return to the cell surface to re-enter the plasma. This release is governed by the binding affinity at neutral pH. Since $K_d^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,7.4}$ is unchanged, the binding affinity at $\\mathrm{pH}\\,7.4$ is also unchanged. The problem premise states that for the wild-type, binding is already weak enough for efficient release. As this characteristic is preserved in the mutant, the release step is **not impaired**.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude the effect on serum half-life.**\nThe serum half-life of an antibody is the time it takes for its concentration in the blood to reduce by half. This is inversely related to its clearance rate. The FcRn salvage pathway is the dominant mechanism that prevents clearance.\nWe have concluded:\n1.  The mutation increases salvage efficiency, meaning a larger fraction of endocytosed IgG is rescued from degradation.\n2.  The mutation does not impair the release of salvaged IgG back into circulation.\n\nA more efficient salvage process leads to a lower overall rate of degradation and clearance from the plasma. Consequently, the IgG molecule will persist in the circulation for a longer duration. Therefore, the **serum half-life increases**.\n\nCombining these findings, the mutation leads to an increase in salvage efficiency and an increase in serum half-life.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Salvage efficiency increases; serum half-life increases.**\nThis aligns perfectly with our derivation. Increased binding at $\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0$ enhances salvage, and because release at $\\mathrm{pH}\\,7.4$ is unaffected, the net result is a longer half-life.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Salvage efficiency decreases; serum half-life decreases.**\nThis is incorrect. A decrease in $K_d^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0}$ signifies stronger, not weaker, binding. Stronger binding at $\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0$ leads to increased, not decreased, salvage efficiency.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Salvage efficiency increases; serum half-life decreases due to impaired release at $\\mathrm{pH}\\,7.4$.**\nThe first part is correct, but the second is not. Release impairment would occur if binding at $\\mathrm{pH}\\,7.4$ became stronger (i.e., if $K_d^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,7.4}$ decreased). The problem explicitly states that $K_d^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,7.4}$ is unchanged. Therefore, release is not impaired, and half-life does not decrease for this reason.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Salvage efficiency is unchanged; serum half-life is unchanged.**\nThis is incorrect. As derived, a $5$-fold change in $K_d$ at $\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0$ will change the receptor occupancy, $\\theta^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0}$, unless the system is fully saturated ($[L] \\gg K_d$ and $\\theta \\approx 1$), a condition not stated and generally not assumed. A change in occupancy directly implies a change in salvage efficiency.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Salvage efficiency increases; serum half-life is unchanged because recycling saturates completely.**\nThe first part is correct. The second part introduces an unsubstantiated assumption. If \"recycling saturates,\" it might imply that the salvage pathway has a maximum capacity. However, increasing the efficiency of capture into this pathway (higher $\\theta^{\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.0}$) would still be expected to increase the total number of molecules salvaged per unit time, up to that capacity, thus increasing half-life. The conclusion that half-life remains unchanged contradicts the fundamental link between salvage efficiency and half-life unless very specific and unstated saturation conditions are met that would also likely contradict the premise that salvage efficiency increases.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2876004"}, {"introduction": "While individual binding events are key, the overall efficiency of the FcRn salvage pathway behaves as a saturable system with a finite capacity.

It represents a standard exercise in chemical kinetics and receptor theory, applied to a simplified yet canonical model of IgG-FcRn interaction. We shall now proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe system is described by the reversible binding of Immunoglobulin G, with concentration $S$, to the Neonatal Fc Receptor, with concentration $R$, forming a complex with concentration $C$. This is followed by trafficking of the complex into a rescue pathway. The reaction scheme is:\n$$ R + S \\underset{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{\\stackrel{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} C \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{tr}}} \\text{Rescue} $$\nHere, $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is the association rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ is the dissociation rate constant, and $k_{\\mathrm{tr}}$ is the trafficking rate constant.\n\nThe rate of change of the complex concentration, $C$, is described by the following ordinary differential equation, based on the law of mass action:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} R S - k_{\\mathrm{off}} C - k_{\\mathrm{tr}} C = k_{\\mathrm{on}} R S - (k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{tr}}) C $$\n\nWe apply the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) to the complex $C$, assuming its concentration equilibrates rapidly compared to changes in the concentration of free IgG, $S$. This implies setting $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{on}} R S = (k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{tr}}) C $$\n\nThe total receptor concentration, $R_{\\mathrm{T}}$, is conserved within the endosomal compartment, so $R_{\\mathrm{T}} = R + C$. From this, we express the free receptor concentration as $R = R_{\\mathrm{T}} - C$. Substituting this expression for $R$ into the steady-state equation yields:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{on}} (R_{\\mathrm{T}} - C) S = (k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{tr}}) C $$\n\nWe now solve for the steady-state complex concentration, $C$, as a function of $S$:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{on}} R_{\\mathrm{T}} S - k_{\\mathrm{on}} C S = (k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{tr}}) C $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{on}} R_{\\mathrm{T}} S = C (k_{\\mathrm{on}} S + k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{tr}}) $$\n$$ C(S) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}} R_{\\mathrm{T}} S}{k_{\\mathrm{on}} S + k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{tr}}} $$\n\nTo simplify this expression into a more canonical form, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$:\n$$ C(S) = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{T}} S}{S + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{tr}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}} $$\n\nThe salvage flux, $v$, is proportional to the rate of complex trafficking, $k_{\\mathrm{tr}} C$. Assuming a proportionality constant of $1$, we have:\n$$ v(S) = k_{\\mathrm{tr}} C(S) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tr}} R_{\\mathrm{T}} S}{S + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{tr}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}} $$\nThis is a saturable expression of the Michaelis-Menten form, $v(S) = \\frac{V_{\\max} S}{K_m + S}$.

Substituting the expression for $\\mathcal{E}(S)$:\n$$ \\frac{K_m}{K_m + S} \\le \\epsilon $$\nSince $K_m$, $S$, and $\\epsilon$ are positive quantities, we can rearrange the inequality without changing its direction:\n$$ K_m \\le \\epsilon (K_m + S) \\implies K_m \\le \\epsilon K_m + \\epsilon S \\implies K_m(1 - \\epsilon) \\le \\epsilon S $$\nThis gives the explicit criterion:\n$$ S \\ge \\frac{K_m(1 - \\epsilon)}{\\epsilon} $$\nFor the specified threshold $\\epsilon = 0.1$, the criterion simplifies to:\n$$ S \\ge \\frac{K_m(1 - 0.1)}{0.1} = \\frac{K_m(0.9)}{0.1} = 9 K_m $$\nThus, the system is considered capacity-limited when the substrate concentration $S$ is at least $9$ times the effective affinity constant $K_m$.
