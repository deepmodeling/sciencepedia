Flow cytometry demonstrates that the target cell has no detectable Fas (CD95) on its surface, but Western blotting and functional assays confirm normal expression and activity of the mitochondrial apoptosis machinery, including BAX, BAK, cytochrome c release, apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), caspase-9, and executioner caspase-3.

It describes the interaction between a CTL and a target cell, involving the two major mechanisms of T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. All molecules and pathways mentioned (CD8$^+$, Fas/FasL, perforin, granzyme B, BAX/BAK, mitochondrial pathway, caspases) are central to this field. The scenario of a virus-infected cell downregulating a surface receptor like Fas to evade the immune system is a known and realistic biological phenomenon.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear and specific scenario. The absence of the Fas receptor is a critical and unambiguous constraint. The question asks for a logical deduction based on this constraint and the provided definitions of the pathways. A unique and logical conclusion can be derived.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical and precise. It presents factual biological conditions without subjective-opinion or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem statement presents no violations of scientific principles, logical consistency, or objectivity. It is a self-contained, well-posed problem grounded in established immunology.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nDerivation of Solution\nThe problem requires an evaluation of the two canonical CTL killing mechanisms under the specific condition that the target cell lacks the Fas receptor (CD95).\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Fas–FasL Pathway:** This pathway is an example of extrinsic apoptosis, initiated by an external signal. It functions through the interaction of a death ligand, FasL (expressed on the surface of the activated CTL), with its cognate death receptor, Fas (expressed on the surface of the target cell). The problem explicitly states that the target cell has \"no detectable Fas (CD95) on its surface\". According to the principle of receptor–ligand dependence for death receptor signaling, the absence of the receptor renders the pathway non-functional. FasL on the CTL cannot bind to its target, and thus the downstream signaling cascade—recruitment of the FADD adaptor protein, formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), and activation of the initiator caspase, caspase-8—cannot be initiated. Therefore, the Fas–FasL pathway is effectively abrogated.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Perforin–Granzyme Pathway:** This pathway involves the directed release of cytotoxic granules from the CTL into the immunological synapse. These granules contain the pore-forming protein perforin and a family of serine proteases called granzymes, with granzyme B being the most potent in inducing apoptosis. The problem states that the delivery mechanism is \"receptor independence for granule exocytosis–mediated delivery\". Perforin creates pores in the target cell membrane, allowing granzyme B to enter the cytosol. Once inside, granzyme B can initiate apoptosis through multiple routes. It can directly cleave and activate executioner caspases such as caspase-3. Alternatively, and of particular relevance here, it can amplify the apoptotic signal by engaging the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. Granzyme B does this by cleaving the BH3-only protein Bid to its truncated form, tBid. The problem explicitly confirms that the machinery of this pathway—including BAX, BAK, cytochrome c, Apaf-1, caspase-9, and caspase-3—is fully functional. The generated tBid translocates to the mitochondria and induces the oligomerization of BAX and BAK, leading to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). This results in the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. Cytochrome c then binds to Apaf-1, triggering the assembly of the apoptosome, which in turn recruits and activates caspase-9. Active caspase-9 then activates executioner caspase-3, culminating in apoptosis.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Since the Fas–FasL pathway is blocked due to the absence of its receptor, and the perforin–granzyme pathway remains fully competent to act on a functional intrinsic apoptotic machinery within the target cell, the perforin–granzyme pathway will be the dominant, if not exclusive, mechanism for killing this target cell.\n\nEvaluation of Options\n**A. Perforin–granzyme B–mediated killing dominates, because perforin enables delivery of granzyme B into the cytosol where it engages the intrinsic pathway by activating Bid, leading to BAX/BAK-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, cytochrome c release, Apaf-1 apoptosome assembly, caspase-9 activation, and downstream caspase-3–mediated apoptosis.**\nThis option correctly identifies the perforin–granzyme pathway as dominant. The provided rationale is an accurate and detailed description of one of the major mechanisms of granzyme B action—the engagement of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway via Bid cleavage. This mechanism is fully consistent with the givens of the problem, which state that the mitochondrial pathway components are all present and functional.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Fas–FasL remains dominant, because caspase-8 can still be recruited to a death-inducing signaling complex via other adaptors even when Fas is absent, so loss of Fas has little impact on extrinsic apoptosis during cytotoxic T cell killing.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The Fas–FasL signaling pathway is critically dependent on the physical interaction between FasL and the Fas receptor. The formation of the canonical DISC that activates caspase-8 in response to FasL requires the Fas receptor. The claim that this can be bypassed by \"other adaptors\" is a biologically false premise in the context of Fas-mediated signaling. The loss of Fas has a definitive, not \"little\", impact: it completely blocks this specific pathway.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-$\\alpha$)–TNF receptor 1 signaling becomes dominant, because TNF-$\\alpha$ secreted by cytotoxic T cells is sufficient to induce apoptosis in most targets independently of mitochondrial amplification and can substitute for the loss of Fas.**\nThis option introduces a pathway, TNF-$\\alpha$ signaling, that is outside the two canonical pathways specified by the problem. The question asks to predict the dominant pathway from the choice of perforin-granzyme and Fas-FasL. Furthermore, the assertion that TNF-$\\alpha$ induces apoptosis \"independently of mitochondrial amplification\" in \"most targets\" is a gross oversimplification and often untrue. Many cell types require mitochondrial amplification (the \"Type II\" pathway) for TNF-$\\alpha$-mediated apoptosis.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Granulysin-mediated osmotic lysis becomes dominant, because granulysin directly disrupts membranes and therefore bypasses both the Fas–FasL and mitochondrial pathways, making the state of the mitochondrial machinery irrelevant.**\nWhile granulysin is a component of cytotoxic granules and can lyse cells at high concentrations, the primary effector of CTL-induced apoptosis is granzyme B. To posit that granulysin-mediated lysis becomes the *dominant* mechanism is not the standard model. More importantly, the rationale argues that the mitochondrial machinery becomes \"irrelevant\". This is a poor argument when the problem explicitly provides that this machinery is functional, and a well-established pathway (granzyme B -> Bid -> mitochondria) directly utilizes it. The most parsimonious explanation is that the CTL uses the pathway that is available and effective, which is the granzyme B-mitochondrial axis.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)–death receptor DR4/DR5 signaling dominates, because TRAIL is constitutively expressed on cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells and does not require the presence of Fas on the target to trigger caspase-8–dependent apoptosis in most cells.**\nSimilar to option C, this introduces a\nthird pathway (TRAIL signaling) which is not one of the two canonical pathways the problem asks to be considered. The solution must be derived from an analysis of the perforin–granzyme and Fas–FasL pathways, as per the problem constraints.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2880418"}, {"introduction": "The principles of cytotoxicity are not just theoretical; they are the basis for powerful diagnostic assays.

It provides a clear and solvable scenario based on established immunological concepts and assays. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Option Analysis**\n\nThe task is to identify the defective step in the patient's perforin–granzyme pathway by interpreting the given experimental results.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Degranulation (CD107a Assay)**: The data shows that the patient's CTLs upregulate surface CD107a from $2\\%$ to $36\\%$ upon stimulation. This is statistically indistinguishable from the healthy controls, who show an increase from $3\\%$ to $38\\%$. CD107a is a component of the lytic granule membrane that becomes exposed on the CTL surface only when the granule fuses with the plasma membrane to release its contents. Therefore, this result unequivocally demonstrates that the molecular machinery responsible for lytic granule polarization, docking, priming, and fusion at the immunological synapse is intact and functional in the patient's CTLs. The process of degranulation itself is normal.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Fas–FasL Pathway (Annexin V Assay)**: The experiment using CMA to inhibit the perforin pathway and target cells sensitive to Fas-mediated killing shows that the patient's CTLs induce apoptosis (measured by annexin V, a marker of early apoptosis) in $62\\%$ of targets. This is comparable to the $58\\%$ induced by control CTLs. This result confirms that the entire Fas–FasL signaling axis is functional, including the expression and function of FasL on the patient's CTLs and the downstream apoptotic signaling cascade within the target cells. This finding effectively isolates the defect to the perforin–granzyme pathway.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Perforin-Granzyme Pathway ($^{51}\\mathrm{Cr}$ Release Assay)**: This assay measures the release of $^{51}\\mathrm{Cr}$ from the cytoplasm of pre-loaded target cells, which occurs upon loss of membrane integrity. This lytic event is primarily caused by pores formed by the perforin protein. The patient's CTLs show a catastrophic failure in this assay, mediating almost no lysis ($<5\\%$ at $4$ hours) compared to the robust lysis by control CTLs ($40\\%$ at $4$ hours).\n\n**Synthesis of Results**\n\nWe have established the following:\n*   Granule exocytosis (degranulation) is **normal**.\n*   The contents of the lytic granules are released into the immunological synapse.\n*   Target cell killing via the perforin-dependent mechanism is severely **impaired**.\n*   Killing via the Fas–FasL pathway is **normal**.\n\nThe defect must therefore lie downstream of granule fusion but be intrinsic to the components of the perforin-granzyme pathway. The logical steps are: release of granule contents, perforin action on the target membrane, and granzyme action within the target cell. The profound defect in the $^{51}\\mathrm{Cr}$ release assay, which directly reflects membrane damage, points to a failure in the very first step after granule release: the formation of pores in the target cell membrane by perforin.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Docking and priming of lytic granules at the immunological synapse (for example, Rab27a or MUNC13-4 dependent steps)**: This step precedes granule membrane fusion. As established by the normal CD107a upregulation, these processes are functional. A defect here would lead to impaired degranulation, which is contrary to the evidence. Thus, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **B. Perforin pore formation in the target cell membrane (for example, due to perforin protein deficiency or misprocessing)**: This hypothesis is perfectly consistent with all observations. Normal degranulation would release a non-functional or absent perforin protein. Without perforin pores, granzymes cannot enter the target cell, and direct membrane lysis does not occur. This single defect fully explains the severe impairment in the $^{51}\\mathrm{Cr}$ release assay despite normal degranulation and a normal Fas-FasL pathway. This clinical picture is characteristic of Familial Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Type 2 (FHL2), which is caused by mutations in the perforin gene ($PRF1$). Thus, this option is **Correct**.\n\n*   **C. Induction or expression of Fas ligand (FasL) on activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes**: The experiment demonstrates that the patient's CTLs mediate Fas-dependent killing at levels comparable to controls. This directly proves that FasL expression and function are intact. Thus, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. Availability and activity of granzymes within lytic granules (for example, granzyme B loss or cathepsin C–dependent activation defect)**: This is a plausible but less likely explanation. If perforin were functional but granzymes were absent or inactive, granzymes would fail to induce apoptosis after entering the cell. However, the $^{51}\\mathrm{Cr}$ release assay primarily measures perforin-mediated lysis. While downstream apoptotic events induced by granzymes contribute to secondary necrosis and can enhance $^{51}\\mathrm{Cr}$ release over time, the near-complete absence of lysis at $4$ hours ($<5\\%$) strongly implicates a failure of the initial, direct membrane-disrupting action of perforin itself. A perforin defect (Option B) is a more fundamental lesion that explains the failure of the entire pathway, including the lack of granzyme delivery. A granzyme-only defect does not explain the lack of primary perforin-mediated lysis as effectively. Therefore, Option B is the *most likely* cause. Thus, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **E. Target cell initiator caspase-8 function downstream of Fas engagement**: The demonstration of normal Fas-FasL mediated apoptosis, measured by annexin V positivity in the target cells, confirms that the target cell's intrinsic apoptotic machinery, including the initiator caspase-8, is functional. A defect here would have prevented the apoptosis observed in the control experiment.
