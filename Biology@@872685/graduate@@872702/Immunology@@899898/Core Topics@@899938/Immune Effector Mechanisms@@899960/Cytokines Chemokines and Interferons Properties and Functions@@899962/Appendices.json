It is scientifically grounded, based on the fundamental law of mass action and the standard model of single-site receptor-ligand binding, which is a cornerstone of biochemistry and pharmacology. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and parameters for a unique solution. The language is objective and the values provided are physiologically plausible for cytokine signaling systems.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, in terms of the ligand concentration, $[L]$, and the dissociation constant, $K_D$.\nWe are given two fundamental equations:\nThe definition of the dissociation constant:\n$$K_D = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\nAnd the conservation of total receptors:\n$$[R]_T = [R] + [RL]$$\nOur goal is to express $\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T}$ as a function of only $[L]$ and $K_D$. To do this, we must eliminate $[R]$ and $[RL]$ from the definition of $\\theta$.\n\nFrom the definition of $K_D$, we can rearrange to solve for the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$:\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_D [RL]}{[L]}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for the total receptor concentration, $[R]_T$:\n$$[R]_T = \\left( \\frac{K_D [RL]}{[L]} \\right) + [RL]$$\nWe can factor out the term for the ligand-receptor complex concentration, $[RL]$:\n$$[R]_T = [RL] \\left( \\frac{K_D}{[L]} + 1 \\right)$$\nTo simplify the term in the parenthesis, we find a common denominator:\n$$[R]_T = [RL] \\left( \\frac{K_D + [L]}{[L]} \\right)$$\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as $\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T}$. We can now substitute our expression for $[R]_T$ into this definition:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL] \\left( \\frac{K_D + [L]}{[L]} \\right)}$$\nThe term $[RL]$ appears in both the numerator and the denominator, and thus it cancels out, provided $[RL] \\neq 0$, which is true for any finite $[L] > 0$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_D + [L]}{[L]}}$$\nInverting the fraction gives the final, well-known expression for fractional occupancy, also known as the Langmuir binding isotherm:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_D}$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we calculate the numerical value of $\\theta$ using the provided parameters: $[L] = 50\\,\\mathrm{pM}$ and $K_D = 100\\,\\mathrm{pM}$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{50\\,\\mathrm{pM}}{50\\,\\mathrm{pM} + 100\\,\\mathrm{pM}} = \\frac{50}{150} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nAs a decimal rounded to $4$ significant figures, this is $\\theta \\approx 0.3333$.\n\nFollowing this, we compute the expected number of occupied receptors per cell. The total number of receptors per cell, $N_T$, is given as $10^4$. The expected number of occupied receptors, $N_{occ}$, is the product of the total number of receptors and the fractional occupancy:\n$$N_{occ} = N_T \\times \\theta = 10^4 \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 3333.33...$$\nThus, at equilibrium, we expect approximately $3333$ receptors to be bound by the cytokine on an average cell.\n\nFinally, we must reason about the saturation of downstream signaling. Saturation of the initial binding event occurs as $\\theta \\to 1$. In our case, $\\theta \\approx 0.3333$, which is significantly less than $1$. Therefore, the receptor binding process itself is not saturated.\n\nHowever, the question concerns the saturation of the *downstream signaling pathway*. The relationship between receptor occupancy and the final cellular response is frequently non-linear. The conclusion depends on the specific nature of the signal transduction cascade, for which no information is given. We must make explicit assumptions.\n\nAssumption $1$: The signaling pathway exhibits a \"spare receptor\" effect. In such systems, a maximal biological response is achieved at a fractional occupancy significantly less than $1$ (i.e., $\\theta \\ll 1$). This occurs if a downstream signaling component becomes the limiting factor and is saturated before all receptors are occupied. If, for instance, the activation of $1000$ receptors is sufficient to saturate the downstream cascade, then with approximately $3333$ receptors occupied, the signaling output would be fully saturated. This is a common feature in sensitive signaling systems where amplification occurs.\n\nAssumption $2$: The signal is directly and linearly proportional to the number of occupied receptors, with no spare receptors. In this case, the signal strength is given by $S = c \\times N_{occ}$, where $c$ is a proportionality constant. The maximum possible signal, $S_{max}$, would be achieved when all receptors are occupied ($N_{occ} = N_T$). The relative signal intensity would be $\\frac{S}{S_{max}} = \\frac{N_{occ}}{N_T} = \\theta$. Under this assumption, with $\\theta \\approx 0.3333$, the signal is at approximately $33.3\\%$ of its maximum and is therefore not saturated.\n\nConclusion on Saturation: Based on first principles of receptor binding alone, the occupancy of $\\theta \\approx 0.3333$ represents a non-saturating condition. However, without knowledge of the downstream signaling architecture, it is impossible to conclude definitively whether the *signal* is saturated. Given that many cytokine signaling pathways have amplification steps and can exhibit spare receptor phenomena, it is plausible that the downstream signal could be saturated even at this modest level of receptor occupancy. But from a purely analytical standpoint based on the provided information, only the binding step can be evaluated, and it is not near saturation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.3333}\n$$", "id": "2845541"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic principles of receptor binding, we can model more complex biological scenarios.

The derivation will be based on the law of mass action under quasi-steady state and low-occupancy conditions.\n\nFirst, let us define the species and reactions for each pathway.\nThe involved species are Interleukin-6 ($I$), total membrane IL-6 receptor ($R_m$), free soluble IL-6 receptor ($S$), and free glycoprotein 130 ($G$).\nThe concentrations of free species are given as $I$, $S$, and $G$.

Therefore, the concentrations of free species can be approximated by their total concentrations. The problem defines $I$, $S$, and $G$ as the free concentrations, and $R_m$ as the total membrane receptor concentration. The low-occupancy assumption implies that the free membrane receptor concentration, $[R_m]_{\\text{free}}$, is approximately equal to its total concentration, $R_m$.\nSo, we have:\n$[I]_{\\text{free}} = I$\n$[R_m]_{\\text{free}} \\approx R_m$\n$[S]_{\\text{free}} = S$\n$[G]_{\\text{free}} = G$\n\nWe can now express the concentrations of the ternary complexes, $[T_m]$ and $[T_s]$, in terms of these free concentrations and the dissociation constants.\n\nFor the classic pathway, we first solve for $[C_m]$:\n$$ [C_m] = \\frac{[I]_{\\text{free}}[R_m]_{\\text{free}}}{K_{1m}} \\approx \\frac{I R_m}{K_{1m}} $$\nNow, we use this to solve for $[T_m]$:\n$$ [T_m] = \\frac{[C_m][G]_{\\text{free}}}{K_{2m}} \\approx \\frac{\\left(\\frac{I R_m}{K_{1m}}\\right) G}{K_{2m}} = \\frac{I G R_m}{K_{1m} K_{2m}} $$\n\nFor the trans-signaling pathway, we perform analogous steps.

Let $L_{\\mathrm{free}}$, $D_{\\mathrm{free}}$, and $[LD]$ be the equilibrium concentrations of the respective species. The equilibrium is governed by the dissociation constant $K_{D}$.\n\nThe law of mass action is:\n$$K_{D} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{free}} D_{\\mathrm{free}}}{[LD]}$$\n\nThe conservation laws for the total ligand and total decoy receptor are:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{tot}} = L_{\\mathrm{free}} + [LD]$$\n$$D_{\\mathrm{tot}} = D_{\\mathrm{free}} + [LD]$$\nThe problem states we can neglect ligand binding to the signaling receptor for the purpose of calculating $L_{\\mathrm{free}}$, so the conservation of ligand equation is exact under this assumption.\n\nFrom the conservation of the decoy receptor, we express the free decoy concentration:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{free}} = D_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [LD]$$\n\nSubstitute this into the mass action equation:\n$$K_{D} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{free}} (D_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [LD])}{[LD]}$$\n\nRearrange this equation to solve for the concentration of the complex $[LD]$:\n$$K_{D} [LD] = L_{\\mathrm{free}} D_{\\mathrm{tot}} - L_{\\mathrm{free}} [LD]$$\n$$[LD] (K_{D} + L_{\\mathrm{free}}) = L_{\\mathrm{free}} D_{\\mathrm{tot}}$$\n$$[LD] = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{free}} D_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{D} + L_{\\mathrm{free}}}$$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $[LD]$ into the ligand conservation equation to obtain the desired relationship:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{tot}} = L_{\\mathrm{free}} + \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{free}} D_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{D} + L_{\\mathrm{free}}}$$\nThis equation relates $L_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ to $L_{\\mathrm{free}}$. To make this an explicit expression for $L_{\\mathrm{free}}$ as a function of $L_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, we can rearrange it into a quadratic equation for $L_{\\mathrm{free}}$:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{tot}} (K_{D} + L_{\\mathrm{free}}) = L_{\\mathrm{free}} (K_{D} + L_{\\mathrm{free}}) + L_{\\mathrm{free}} D_{\\mathrm{tot}}$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{tot}}K_{D} + L_{\\mathrm{tot}}L_{\\mathrm{free}} = K_{D}L_{\\mathrm{free}} + L_{\\mathrm{free}}^2 + D_{\\mathrm{tot}}L_{\\mathrm{free}}$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{free}}^2 + (K_{D} + D_{\\mathrm{tot}} - L_{\\mathrm{tot}}) L_{\\mathrm{free}} - L_{\\mathrm{tot}} K_{D} = 0$$\nSolving this using the quadratic formula yields $L_{\\mathrm{free}}$ as a function of $L_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, $D_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, and $K_{D}$. This completes the derivation.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the apparent EC50, $EC_{50}^{\\prime}$**\n\nThe apparent half-maximal effective concentration, $EC_{50}^{\\prime}$, is defined as the total ligand concentration $L_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ that produces a half-maximal effect, $E/E_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe effect is given by $\\theta = E/E_{\\max} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{free}}}{K_{R} + L_{\\mathrm{free}}}$.\nSetting this to $\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{free}}}{K_{R} + L_{\\mathrm{free}}}$$\n$$K_{R} + L_{\\mathrm{free}} = 2 L_{\\mathrm{free}}$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{free}} = K_{R}$$\nThus, the half-maximal effect occurs when the free ligand concentration equals the dissociation constant of the signaling receptor.\n\nTo find $EC_{50}^{\\prime}$, we substitute $L_{\\mathrm{free}} = K_{R}$ into the expression derived in Part 1:\n$$EC_{50}^{\\prime} = L_{\\mathrm{tot}}|_{L_{\\mathrm{free}}=K_{R}} = K_{R} + \\frac{K_{R} D_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{D} + K_{R}}$$\nWe are given the values: $K_{R} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $K_{D} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, and $D_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n$$EC_{50}^{\\prime} = 0.5 + \\frac{(0.5)(10)}{0.1 + 0.5} = 0.5 + \\frac{5}{0.6} = 0.5 + \\frac{25}{3}$$\n$$EC_{50}^{\\prime} = 0.5 + 8.333... = 8.8333...\\,\\mathrm{nM}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $EC_{50}^{\\prime} = 8.83\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the maximal fractional effect for $L_{\\mathrm{tot},\\max} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$**\n\nWe need to find the fractional effect $\\theta$ when $L_{\\mathrm{tot}} = L_{\\mathrm{tot},\\max} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. First, we must compute the corresponding free ligand concentration, $L_{\\mathrm{free}}$. We use the quadratic equation derived in Part 1:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{free}}^2 + (K_{D} + D_{\\mathrm{tot}} - L_{\\mathrm{tot}}) L_{\\mathrm{free}} - L_{\\mathrm{tot}} K_{D} = 0$$\nSubstitute the known values: $L_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $D_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $K_{D} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n$$L_{\\mathrm{free}}^2 + (0.1 + 10 - 1.0) L_{\\mathrm{free}} - (1.0)(0.1) = 0$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{free}}^2 + 9.1 L_{\\mathrm{free}} - 0.1 = 0$$\nWe solve for $L_{\\mathrm{free}}$ using the quadratic formula, taking the physically meaningful positive root:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{free}} = \\frac{-9.1 + \\sqrt{(9.1)^2 - 4(1)(-0.1)}}{2} = \\frac{-9.1 + \\sqrt{82.81 + 0.4}}{2}$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{free}} = \\frac{-9.1 + \\sqrt{83.21}}{2} \\approx \\frac{-9.1 + 9.12195}{2} = \\frac{0.02195}{2} = 0.010975\\,\\mathrm{nM}$$\nNow, we calculate the maximal achievable fractional effect, $E_{\\mathrm{app},\\max}/E_{\\max} = \\theta(L_{\\mathrm{tot},\\max})$, using this value of $L_{\\mathrm{free}}$ and the given $K_{R} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n$$\\theta = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{free}}}{K_{R} + L_{\\mathrm{free}}} = \\frac{0.010975}{0.5 + 0.010975} = \\frac{0.010975}{0.510975}$$\n$$\\theta \\approx 0.0214798$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the maximal fractional effect is $0.0215$.\n\nThe final answers are $EC_{50}^{\\prime} \\approx 8.83\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{app},\\max}/E_{\\max} \\approx 0.0215$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 8.83 & 0.0215 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2845550"}]}
