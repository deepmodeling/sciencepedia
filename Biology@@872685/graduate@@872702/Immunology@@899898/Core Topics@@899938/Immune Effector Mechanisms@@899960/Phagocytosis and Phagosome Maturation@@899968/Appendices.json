You load the phagosome with a monoprotic, ratiometric pH-sensitive dye that exists in a protonated form, denoted $\\mathrm{HA}$, and a deprotonated form, denoted $\\mathrm{A}^{-}$.

After sealing, actin around nascent phagosomes normally depolymerizes; sustained cortical actin around phagosomes can impede their engagement with microtubules and the assembly of fusion machinery.\n- Nocodazole depolymerizes microtubules; latrunculin B sequesters globular actin and promotes actin filament depolymerization.\n\nAssuming drugs are added only after phagosome closure, and that $E$ can be expressed qualitatively as $E \\propto k_{\\mathrm{enc}} \\times p_{\\mathrm{fuse}}$, where $k_{\\mathrm{enc}}$ is the rate that phagosomes encounter lysosomes by directed transport and $p_{\\mathrm{fuse}}$ is the probability that an encounter culminates in fusion, which of the following predictions best captures the comparative effects of nocodazole versus latrunculin B on $E$, and justifies them mechanistically under these conditions?\n\nA. Nocodazole will markedly decrease $E$, whereas latrunculin B will have little effect or slightly increase $E$. Microtubule loss reduces $k_{\\mathrm{enc}}$ by eliminating dynein/kinesin-driven transport toward lysosome-rich perinuclear regions, while post-closure actin depolymerization does not impair microtubule-based transport and can relieve actin-based barriers to maturation, modestly increasing $p_{\\mathrm{fuse}}$.\n\nB.

We must analyze the effect of each drug on the terms $k_{\\mathrm{enc}}$ and $p_{\\mathrm{fuse}}$.\n\n1.  **Effect of Nocodazole**:\n    -   Nocodazole depolymerizes microtubules.\n    -   According to the foundational principles, long-range, directed transport of phagosomes to the lysosome-rich perinuclear region is mediated by microtubule-based motors (dynein). This process is the primary determinant of the encounter rate, $k_{\\mathrm{enc}}$.\n    -   By eliminating the microtubule network, nocodazole abolishes this directed transport. Phagosomes and lysosomes are then left to encounter each other via slow, random diffusion (Brownian motion), which drastically reduces the frequency of encounters over the $30$-minute observation period.\n    -   Therefore, nocodazole treatment will cause a significant decrease in $k_{\\mathrm{enc}}$.\n    -   Consequently, the fusion efficiency $E$ is expected to be markedly decreased.\n\n2.  **Effect of Latrunculin B**:\n    -   Latrunculin B promotes the depolymerization of actin filaments.\n    -   The problem states that drugs are added *after* phagosome closure, meaning the essential role of actin in particle engulfment is already complete.\n    -   The foundational principles state that post-closure, the actin coat around the phagosome *normally depolymerizes* and that *sustained* actin can *impede* maturation by blocking access to microtubules or fusion machinery.\n    -   Therefore, adding a drug that promotes the removal of this actin coat should not be inhibitory. It acts in concert with the normal physiological process.\n    -   The effect on $k_{\\mathrm{enc}}$ should be minimal, as microtubule-based transport is unaffected.\n    -   The effect on $p_{\\mathrm{fuse}}$ could be neutral or even slightly positive. By ensuring the complete and rapid removal of a potentially obstructive actin shell, latrunculin B might relieve steric hindrance, thereby facilitating the assembly of the fusion machinery (e.g., SNAREs, Rab effectors) on the phagosome membrane. This could lead to a modest increase in $p_{\\mathrm{fuse}}$.\n    -   Overall, latrunculin B is expected to have little effect on $E$, or potentially cause a slight increase.\n\n**Conclusion**: Nocodazole will strongly inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion by disrupting transport ($k_{\\mathrm{enc}}$). Latrunculin B will not be inhibitory and may even be slightly stimulatory by facilitating later maturation steps ($p_{\\mathrm{fuse}}$).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Nocodazole will markedly decrease $E$, whereas latrunculin B will have little effect or slightly increase $E$. Microtubule loss reduces $k_{\\mathrm{enc}}$ by eliminating dynein/kinesin-driven transport toward lysosome-rich perinuclear regions, while post-closure actin depolymerization does not impair microtubule-based transport and can relieve actin-based barriers to maturation, modestly increasing $p_{\\mathrm{fuse}}$.**\n- This statement accurately reflects the derivation. It correctly attributes the effect of nocodazole to a reduction in $k_{\\mathrm{enc}}$ via microtubule disruption. It also correctly reasons that latrunculin B, acting after closure, would not be inhibitory and could even be beneficial by removing an actin-based barrier, potentially increasing $p_{\\mathrm{fuse}}$.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Both nocodazole and latrunculin B will similarly decrease $E$ because both microtubules and actin are equally required for long-range centripetal transport of phagosomes and lysosomes; disrupting either cytoskeleton reduces $k_{\\mathrm{enc}}$ to a similar extent.**\n- This statement is incorrect. The foundational base explicitly assigns the role of long-range transport to microtubules. Actin's primary role is in the earlier stage of uptake, and its presence post-closure is inhibitory, not facilitatory, to transport and maturation. Thus, they are not \"equally required\" for the post-closure process being measured.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Nocodazole will increase $E$ by dispersing lysosomes and enhancing their diffusive encounters with phagosomes, whereas latrunculin B will decrease $E$ because actin is required for the assembly of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) fusion machinery on maturing phagosomes.**\n- This statement is incorrect. While nocodazole disperses lysosomes, this replaces efficient, directed transport with inefficient, random diffusion, which would decrease, not increase, $k_{\\mathrm{enc}}$ and thus $E$. The claim that latrunculin B is inhibitory because actin is required for SNARE machinery assembly contradicts the provided information that sustained actin is an impediment to maturation.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Latrunculin B will severely decrease $E$ because actin is needed for all fusion events, while nocodazole will have minimal effect because dynein-driven transport can proceed along intermediate filaments in the absence of microtubules.**\n- This statement is incorrect. The reasoning for latrunculin B's effect is flawed, as explained previously. Furthermore, the claim that dynein transport can proceed along intermediate filaments is factually wrong; dynein is a microtubule-specific motor protein. This contradicts the foundational principles.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Both drugs will have minimal effect on $E$ because random Brownian motion dominates organelle collisions in the crowded cytoplasm, making directed transport negligible over tens of minutes at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.**\n- This statement is incorrect. It directly contradicts a central premise of the problem: \"Long-range, directed organelle transport ... occurs primarily on microtubules\". If this premise is accepted, then directed transport cannot be negligible. The existence of motor proteins and cytoskeletal tracks evolved precisely because Brownian motion is insufficient for efficient, long-range transport in eukaryotic cells.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2881424"}]}
