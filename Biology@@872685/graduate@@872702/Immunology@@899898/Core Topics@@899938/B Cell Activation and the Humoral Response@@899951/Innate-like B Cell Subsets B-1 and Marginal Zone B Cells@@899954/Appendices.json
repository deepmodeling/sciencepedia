Self-renewal: This is a per-capita process with rate $r$. Assuming mass-action kinetics, the total rate of self-renewal is the per-capita rate multiplied by the number of cells, which is $r N(t)$.\n    2.  External Source: There is a constant, time-independent source of new cells, $s$.\n    The total rate of gain is therefore $r N(t) + s$.\n\n- **Losses:** The losses consist of two components:\n    1.  Death: This is a per-capita process with rate $d$. The total rate of loss due to death is $d N(t)$.\n    2.  Differentiation: This is a per-capita process with rate $k$. The total rate of loss due to differentiation is $k N(t)$.\n    The total rate of loss is the sum of these two rates: $d N(t) + k N(t) = (d + k) N(t)$.\n\nCombining these terms into the conservation equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = (r N(t) + s) - (d + k) N(t)\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged by grouping the terms dependent on $N(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = (r - d - k) N(t) + s\n$$\nThis is the first-order linear ordinary differential equation governing the dynamics of the B-1 cell population $N(t)$.\n\n**2) Steady-State Analysis**\n\nThe steady-state solution, denoted $N^{\\ast}$, is the population size at which the net rate of change is zero. We find this by setting $\\frac{dN}{dt} = 0$.\n$$\n0 = (r - d - k) N^{\\ast} + s\n$$\nSolving for $N^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n-(r - d - k) N^{\\ast} = s\n$$\n$$\n(d + k - r) N^{\\ast} = s\n$$\nThus, the steady-state solution is:\n$$\nN^{\\ast} = \\frac{s}{d + k - r}\n$$\nFor $N^{\\ast}$ to be a physically meaningful (positive) population number, given that the source term $s$ is inherently non-negative ($s \\geq 0$, and in this problem $s > 0$), the denominator must be positive.\n$$\nd + k - r > 0\n$$\nThis is equivalent to the condition that the total per-capita loss rate must exceed the per-capita renewal rate:\n$$\nd + k > r\n$$\nNext, we analyze the local stability of this steady state. Let the right-hand side of the ODE be $f(N) = (r - d - k) N + s$. A fixed point $N^{\\ast}$ is locally asymptotically stable if the derivative of $f(N)$ evaluated at $N^{\\ast}$ is negative, i.e., $f'(N^{\\ast}) < 0$.\nThe derivative is:\n$$\nf'(N) = \\frac{d}{dN} \\left[ (r - d - k) N + s \\right] = r - d - k\n$$\nSince the derivative is a constant, its value is the same for all $N$, including $N^{\\ast}$.

This is precisely the same condition required for the steady state $N^{\\ast}$ to be positive, assuming $s > 0$.
