It is therefore deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem is a number balance for vesicles within the control volume of the lymph node. Let $N(t)$ be the total number of vesicles within the LN volume $V_{\\mathrm{LN}}$ at time $t$. The concentration of vesicles, assuming perfect mixing, is uniform throughout the volume and is given by $C(t) = N(t)/V_{\\mathrm{LN}}$. The rate of change of the number of vesicles is given by the balance of influx and efflux processes:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = (\\text{Rate In}) - (\\text{Rate Out}) - (\\text{Rate of Capture})\n$$\nThe terms are defined as follows:\n- Rate In: The constant influx of vesicles, given as $r$.\n- Rate Out: The hydrodynamic washout of vesicles via efferent lymph. For a perfectly mixed system, the concentration of vesicles in the exiting fluid is the same as the concentration inside the volume, $C(t)$. The rate of removal is thus $Q \\cdot C(t)$.\n- Rate of Capture: This is a first-order process with rate constant $k_{c}$, so the rate is proportional to the total number of vesicles present, $k_{c} \\cdot N(t)$.\n\nSubstituting these terms and expressing everything in terms of concentration $C(t) = N(t)/V_{\\mathrm{LN}}$ yields the governing ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d(C(t)V_{\\mathrm{LN}})}{dt} = r - Q \\cdot C(t) - k_{c} \\cdot C(t)V_{\\mathrm{LN}}\n$$\nSince $V_{\\mathrm{LN}}$ is a constant volume, we have:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{LN}} \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = r - (Q + k_{c}V_{\\mathrm{LN}})C(t)\n$$\nThe problem specifies steady-state conditions, which implies that the concentration is constant, i.e., $\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = 0$. Let $C_{ss}$ denote the steady-state concentration. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n0 = r - (Q + k_{c}V_{\\mathrm{LN}})C_{ss}\n$$\nSolving for the steady-state concentration gives:\n$$\nC_{ss} = \\frac{r}{Q + k_{c}V_{\\mathrm{LN}}}\n$$\nThe single-pass capture fraction, $p_{\\mathrm{cap}}$, is the fraction of entering vesicles that are captured rather than washed out. At steady state, this fraction is the ratio of the total capture rate to the total input rate.\nThe total capture rate at steady state is $k_{c} \\cdot N_{ss} = k_{c} \\cdot C_{ss} \\cdot V_{\\mathrm{LN}}$.\nThe total input rate is $r$.\nTherefore:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{cap}} = \\frac{k_{c} C_{ss} V_{\\mathrm{LN}}}{r}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{ss}$:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{cap}} = \\frac{k_{c} V_{\\mathrm{LN}}}{r} \\left( \\frac{r}{Q + k_{c}V_{\\mathrm{LN}}} \\right) = \\frac{k_{c}V_{\\mathrm{LN}}}{Q + k_{c}V_{\\mathrm{LN}}}\n$$\nThis expression represents the derived single-pass capture fraction. It correctly compares the effective rate of capture, $k_c V_{\\mathrm{LN}}$, to the sum of the rates of all removal pathways, washout ($Q$) and capture ($k_c V_{\\mathrm{LN}}$), if one divides the numerator and denominator by $V_{LN}$ to work with rate constants ($k_c$ vs $Q/V_{LN}$).\n\nNext, we must find the hourly capture dose, $D$.
