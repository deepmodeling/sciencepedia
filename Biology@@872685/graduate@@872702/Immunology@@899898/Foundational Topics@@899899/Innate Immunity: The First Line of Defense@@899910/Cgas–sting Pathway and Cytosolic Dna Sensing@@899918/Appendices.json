Two ligands—2'-3' cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) produced by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and 3'-3' cyclic di-GMP (CDG) of bacterial origin—compete for this pocket in the cytosol. Assume a well-mixed compartment at equilibrium, constant free ligand concentrations, and that binding obeys the law of mass action with a single non-cooperative site per STING. The dissociation constants are defined by the fundamental relation of reversible binding, namely for each ligand species $i$,\n\n$$\nK_{d,i} \\equiv \\frac{[R][L_i]}{[RL_i]},\n$$\n\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of unbound STING, $[L_i]$ is the free concentration of ligand $i$, and $[RL_i]$ is the concentration of the corresponding STING–ligand complex.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for its resolution. I will therefore proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nLet $R$ denote the STING protein, $L_1$ denote the ligand 2'-3' cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP), and $L_2$ denote the ligand 3'-3' cyclic di-GMP (CDG).

The law of mass conservation for the receptor dictates that:\n$$\n[R_T] = [R] + [RL_1] + [RL_2]\n$$\n\nThe problem requires us to compute the ratio of the fractional occupancies, $f_1/f_2$. Let us express this ratio using the definitions:\n$$\n\\frac{f_1}{f_2} = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{cGAMP}}}{f_{\\mathrm{CDG}}} = \\frac{[RL_1]/[R_T]}{[RL_2]/[R_T]}\n$$\nThe total STING concentration, $[R_T]$, cancels from the expression, simplifying the ratio to:\n$$\n\\frac{f_1}{f_2} = \\frac{[RL_1]}{[RL_2]}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the ratio of occupancies is independent of the total receptor concentration, a crucial simplification.\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $[RL_1]$ and $[RL_2]$ derived from the dissociation constants:\n$$\n\\frac{f_1}{f_2} = \\frac{\\frac{[R][L_1]}{K_{d,1}}}{\\frac{[R][L_2]}{K_{d,2}}}\n$$\nThe concentration of free receptor, $[R]$, also cancels, as it is a common factor for both binding equilibria.

It is not incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or trivial. It requires substantive reasoning based on the provided biophysical principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe problem is analyzed based on the principles of ligand-induced conformational selection and avidity.\n\n1.  **Conformational Equilibrium and Ligand Binding:** STING exists in a thermal equilibrium between an \"open\" and a \"closed\" conformation for its ligand-binding domain lid. In the absence of ligand, this equilibrium favors the open state. The ligand, $2'3'$-cGAMP, preferentially binds to and stabilizes the closed conformation, shifting the equilibrium toward this state. This is a classic conformational selection mechanism. The population of STING in the functional, closed state is a function of the ligand concentration.\n\n2.  **Function of the Closed State:** The problem explicitly states that the lid-closed conformation is what \"promotes higher-order oligomerization\". This oligomerization, in turn, facilitates the \"multivalent clustering of STING units\" and \"exposure/clustering of STING C-terminal tails\". This clustered platform is essential for the efficient, avidity-driven recruitment and activation of TBK$1$. Therefore, the extent and stability of STING oligomerization is directly proportional to the amount of TBK$1$ that can be recruited.\n\n3.  **Impact of the Mutation:** The engineered mutation \"destabilizes the closed conformation\".\n    - **Effect on $EC_{50}$:** The $EC_{50}$ of the dose-response curve represents the ligand concentration required to achieve half of the maximal effect. The \"effect\" here is TBK$1$ recruitment, which depends on STING oligomerization. Because the mutation makes the closed conformation intrinsically less stable, a higher concentration of the stabilizing ligand ($2'3'$-cGAMP) is required to shift the conformational equilibrium to the same point as in the wild-type. In other words, more ligand is needed to achieve the critical concentration of oligomerization-competent, closed-state STING. This means the system becomes less sensitive to the ligand. A decrease in sensitivity corresponds to a rightward shift of the dose-response curve, which is quantified as an **increase in the apparent $EC_{50}$**.\n    - **Effect on $E_{\\max}$:** The $E_{\\max}$ represents the maximal effect achievable at a saturating concentration of ligand. At saturation, we assume all ligand-binding sites on STING are occupied. However, the mutation destabilizes the closed conformation itself. This means that even when ligand-bound, the closed-state STING dimer is less stable and has a higher propensity to revert to the open state, or the oligomers formed from these less stable units are themselves less stable and/or smaller in size. The problem states that efficient TBK$1$ recruitment relies on \"multivalent clustering\", which is an avidity-driven process. Avidity depends critically on the stability and multivalency of the binding platform. A less stable or less extensive oligomer provides a poorer platform for multivalent binding of TBK$1$, thus reducing the overall strength and efficiency of recruitment. Consequently, the maximum level of recruitment that can be attained, even with infinite ligand, will be lower than that of the wild-type. Therefore, **the $E_{\\max}$ will decrease**.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation:** The mutation is predicted to both increase the $EC_{50}$ and decrease the $E_{\\max}$ for TBK$1$ recruitment in response to $2'3'$-cGAMP.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **A. TBK$1$ recruitment efficiency will decrease, with both a right-shifted apparent half-maximal effective concentration ($EC_{50}$ increases) and a lower maximal recruitment ($E_{\\max}$ decreases), because destabilizing the lid-closed state reduces the fraction and lifetime of oligomerization-competent STING and thereby weakens multivalent avidity.**\n    - This statement aligns perfectly with the derivation. It correctly identifies that both $EC_{50}$ will increase and $E_{\\max}$ will decrease. The provided reasoning—that destabilizing the oligomerization-competent state weakens the avidity-dependent recruitment—is precisely the correct biophysical mechanism.\n    - **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n- **B. TBK$1$ recruitment efficiency will increase at low ligand (left-shifted $EC_{50}$) while $E_{\\max}$ remains unchanged, because a destabilized lid cycles faster and accelerates encounter rates with TBK$1$.**\n    - This is incorrect. Destabilizing the active conformation decreases, not increases, sensitivity to the ligand, leading to an increase, not a decrease, in $EC_{50}$. The reasoning about faster cycling enhancing recruitment is flawed; avidity-based interactions require a stable platform, not a transient one. Faster dissociation from the closed state would weaken, not strengthen, the overall process.\n    - **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n- **C. The TBK$1$ recruitment curve will be unchanged, because TBK$1$ binds only the STING C-terminal tail independent of ligand-induced lid closure and oligomerization.**\n    - This is incorrect as it directly contradicts the premises given in the problem statement. The problem explicitly links lid closure to oligomerization, which is required for efficient TBK$1$ recruitment via multivalent clustering.\n    - **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n- **D. Basal (ligand-independent) TBK$1$ recruitment will increase, because the open conformation exposes the C-terminal tail constitutively, increasing TBK$1$ access without ligand.**\n    - This is incorrect. The problem states that the CTTs are exposed and clustered as a consequence of oligomerization, which is promoted by the *closed* state, not the open state. There is no information to suggest the open state is active for TBK$1$ recruitment.\n    - **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n- **E. $E_{\\max}$ will decrease but $EC_{50}$ will be unchanged, because the lid affects only the number of available TBK$1$ docking sites but not their apparent ligand sensitivity.**\n    - This is incorrect. While it correctly predicts a decrease in $E_{\\max}$, it incorrectly claims $EC_{50}$ is unchanged. The stability of the conformation that the ligand induces is thermodynamically linked to the apparent affinity of the ligand for the system. By destabilizing the target conformation, the mutation necessarily reduces the apparent sensitivity of the system to the ligand, thus increasing the $EC_{50}$.\n    - **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2839410"}, {"introduction": "Signaling pathways like cGAS-STING are embedded within complex regulatory networks that ensure responses are appropriately controlled over time.

The objective is to quantify the impact of this feedback by comparing the signaling response to a cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) stimulus in a naive system versus a system previously primed by an initial stimulus.\n\nFirst, we formalize the stated biological mechanisms into a mathematical model. We are given three state variables: the concentration of active STING, denoted $A(t)$; the concentration of an interferon proxy, $F(t)$; and the concentration of USP13, $U(t)$.\n\nThe dynamics of active STING, $A(t)$, are governed by its activation and deactivation. Activation is driven by the cGAMP input signal, $c(t)$, and depends on the available pool of inactive STING, $S(t)$. Given the conservation law $S_{\\mathrm{tot}} = S(t) + A(t)$, where $S_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is the total STING concentration, the inactive pool is $S(t) = S_{\\mathrm{tot}} - A(t)$. The activation rate, following mass-action kinetics, is thus $k_{\\mathrm{on}} c(t) (S_{\\mathrm{tot}} - A(t))$. Deactivation occurs through two pathways: a basal, first-order process with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, and a feedback-driven deubiquitination process. The latter's rate is proportional to both active STING, $A(t)$, and the protease concentration, $U(t)$, with a rate coefficient $k_{\\mathrm{du}}$. Combining these terms, the total deactivation rate is $(k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{du}} U(t))A(t)$. The resulting ODE for $A(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} c(t) (S_{\\mathrm{tot}} - A) - (k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{du}} U) A $$\n\nNext, we model the interferon proxy, $F(t)$. Its production is stipulated to be first-order with respect to active STING, $A(t)$, with a rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{IFN}}$. It undergoes first-order decay with rate constant $k_{F}$. This translates to the following linear ODE:\n$$ \\frac{dF}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{IFN}} A - k_{F} F $$\n\nFinally, we describe the dynamics of the feedback regulator, USP13, represented by $U(t)$. Its production is a sum of a constant basal rate, $u_{0}$, and an interferon-induced term proportional to $F(t)$ with rate constant $k_{U}$. Its degradation is a first-order process with rate constant $k_{dU}$. The ODE for $U(t)$ is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{dU}{dt} = u_{0} + k_{U} F - k_{dU} U $$\n\nThe system of three coupled ODEs is thus fully defined. The initial conditions are specified for a system at basal steady-state, absent any cGAMP stimulus: $A(0) = 0$, $F(0) = 0$, and $U(0) = u_{0} / k_{dU}$. The last condition represents the steady state of the third ODE when $F=0$.\n\nThe core of the problem is to perform a numerical experiment to compare two scenarios. In the \"naive\" scenario, the system is subjected to a single cGAMP pulse, $c(t) = g_{2}$ for $t \\in [0, T_{2}]$. In the \"primed\" scenario, the system receives a preliminary pulse, $c(t) = g_{1}$ for $t \\in [0, T_{1}]$, followed by a recovery period of duration $\\Delta T$ where $c(t)=0$, and then the same second pulse, $c(t) = g_{2}$ for $t \\in [T_{1} + \\Delta T, T_{1} + \\Delta T + T_{2}]$.\n\nThe signaling output is defined as $Y(t) = k_{\\mathrm{IFN}} A(t)$. We are tasked with computing the ratio $R = Y_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{primed}} / Y_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{naive}}$. Here, $Y_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{naive}}$ is the maximum value of $Y(t)$ during the pulse in the naive simulation, i.e., for $t \\in [0, T_{2}]$. Similarly, $Y_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{primed}}$ is the maximum of $Y(t)$ during the *second* pulse in the primed simulation, i.e., for $t \\in [T_{1} + \\Delta T, T_{1} + \\Delta T + T_{2}]$. This ratio $R$ quantifies the attenuation of the signaling response due to the prior stimulation.\n\nTo solve this, we will implement a program that numerically integrates the ODE system for each test case under both naive and primed conditions. We will use a standard numerical integration routine from the SciPy library, `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, which is suitable for such initial value problems. To accurately determine the maximum of $Y(t)$ within the specified time windows, the integrator's dense output feature will be utilized. This allows for evaluation of the solution on a fine time grid covering the window of interest, ensuring the peak value is not missed. For each parameter set, the program will execute the two simulations, find the respective peak outputs, compute the ratio $R$ according to the specified rules, and format the result as required.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructs and solves a dynamical model of the cGAS-STING pathway to compute\n    the effect of IFN priming on subsequent signaling.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Parameter tuple order:\n    # p = (k_on, k_off, k_du, k_IFN, k_F, u0, k_U, k_dU, S_tot, g1, T1, delta_T, g2, T2)\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.2, 0.05, 0.2, 1.5, 0.1, 0.002, 0.05, 0.02, 1.0, 1.0, 60.0, 120.0, 1.0, 60.0),\n        (0.2, 0.05, 0.0, 1.5, 0.1, 0.002, 0.05, 0.02, 1.0, 1.0, 60.0, 120.0, 1.0, 60.0),\n        (0.2, 0.05, 0.2, 1.5, 0.1, 0.002, 0.0, 0.02, 1.0, 1.0, 60.0, 120.0, 1.0, 60.0),\n        (0.2, 0.05, 0.5, 1.5, 0.1, 0.002, 0.1, 0.02, 1.0, 1.0, 120.0, 10.0, 1.0, 60.0),\n        (0.2, 0.05, 0.2, 1.5, 0.1, 0.002, 0.05, 0.02, 1.0, 1.0, 60.0, 600.0, 1.0, 60.0),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    for params_tuple in test_cases:\n        k_on, k_off, k_du, k_IFN, k_F, u0, k_U, k_dU, S_tot, g1, T1, delta_T, g2, T2 = params_tuple\n\n        def odes(t, y, c_func, params):\n            \"\"\"Defines the system of ODEs for the cGAS-STING model.\"\"\"\n            k_on, k_off, k_du, k_IFN, k_F, u0, k_U, k_dU, S_tot = params\n            A, F, U = y\n            c_val = c_func(t)\n            dAdt = k_on * c_val * (S_tot - A) - (k_off + k_du * U) * A\n            dFdt = k_IFN * A - k_F * F\n            dUdt = u0 + k_U * F - k_dU * U\n            return [dAdt, dFdt, dUdt]\n\n        # Shared initial conditions and ODE parameters\n        y0 = [0.0, 0.0, u0 / k_dU if k_dU > 0 else 0.0]\n        ode_params = (k_on, k_off, k_du, k_IFN, k_F, u0, k_U, k_dU, S_tot)\n        integrator_kwargs = {'method': 'RK45', 'dense_output': True, 'rtol': 1e-6, 'atol': 1e-9}\n\n        # --- Naive Simulation ---\n        def c_func_naive(t):\n            return g2 if 0.0 = t = T2 else 0.0\n\n        t_span_naive = [0.0, T2]\n        Y_max_naive = 0.0\n        \n        if T2 > 0:\n            sol_naive = solve_ivp(\n                lambda t, y: odes(t, y, c_func_naive, ode_params),\n                t_span_naive,\n                y0,\n                **integrator_kwargs\n            )\n            t_eval_naive = np.linspace(t_span_naive[0], t_span_naive[1], 500)\n            y_eval_naive = sol_naive.sol(t_eval_naive)\n            A_sol_naive = y_eval_naive[0]\n            Y_naive = k_IFN * A_sol_naive\n            if Y_naive.size > 0:\n                Y_max_naive = np.max(Y_naive)\n\n        # --- Primed Simulation ---\n        def c_func_primed(t):\n            if 0.0 = t = T1:\n                return g1\n            elif T1 + delta_T = t = T1 + delta_T + T2:\n                return g2\n            else:\n                return 0.0\n\n        t_end_primed = T1 + delta_T + T2\n        t_span_primed = [0.0, t_end_primed]\n        Y_max_primed = 0.0\n\n        sol_primed = solve_ivp(\n            lambda t, y: odes(t, y, c_func_primed, ode_params),\n            t_span_primed,\n            y0,\n            **integrator_kwargs\n        )\n            \n        t_window_start = T1 + delta_T\n        t_window_end = t_end_primed\n\n        if t_window_start  t_window_end:\n            t_eval_primed = np.linspace(t_window_start, t_window_end, 500)\n            y_eval_primed = sol_primed.sol(t_eval_primed)\n            A_sol_primed = y_eval_primed[0]\n            Y_primed = k_IFN * A_sol_primed\n            if Y_primed.size > 0:\n                Y_max_primed = np.max(Y_primed)\n\n        # --- Calculate Ratio R as per problem specification ---\n        if Y_max_naive == 0.0:\n            R = 1.0 if Y_max_primed == 0.0 else 0.0\n        else:\n            R = Y_max_primed / Y_max_naive\n        \n        results.append(f\"{R:.3f}\")\n\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2839431"}]}
