They have human serum with a complete genetic deficiency of complement component `$C_2$`. This serum is otherwise normal in levels of `$C_3$`, Factor B, Factor D, properdin, and terminal pathway components `$C_5$` through `$C_9$`. They incubate the `$C_2$`-deficient serum with Gram-negative bacteria whose outer membranes do not strongly inhibit the alternative pathway and then assay for deposition of opsonin `$C_{3b}$` on bacterial surfaces, generation of anaphylatoxins `$C_{3a}$` and `$C_{5a}$`, and assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC; `$C5b-9$`). They further consider downstream consequences for antibody-dependent complement functions and immune complex handling by erythrocyte complement receptor 1 (CR1).\n\nStarting from the core definitions that the complement system has three initiation routes (classical, lectin, and alternative), that all routes converge at cleavage of `$C_3$` to `$C_{3a}$` and `$C_{3b}$`, and that the classical and lectin routes use a `$C_3$` convertase distinct from the alternative route, which of the following statements best predicts which pathway(s) can still deposit `$C_{3b}$` on bacterial surfaces in this setting and which effector functions are impaired?\n\nA. Only the alternative pathway can generate surface `$C_{3b}$`; the classical and lectin pathways are ablated.

The pathways, components (`$C_2, C_3, C_4, C_5-9$`, Factor B, Factor D), effector molecules (`$C_{3a}, C_{3b}, C_{5a}$`, MAC), and functions (opsonization, inflammation, lysis, immune complex clearance) are fundamental concepts in immunology.

There is no ambiguity or subjective content.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Principle-Based Derivation**\nThe complement system's function hinges on the formation of enzymes called convertases. We must analyze the impact of `$C_2$` deficiency on the formation of these convertases in each of the three pathways.\n\n1.  **Classical Pathway**: This pathway is typically initiated by an antibody-antigen complex binding to `$C1q$`. This activates the `$C1$` complex (`$C1qrs$`), which then cleaves `$C_4$` into `$C_{4a}$` and `$C_{4b}$`, and `$C_2$` into `$C_{2a}$` and `$C_{2b}$`. The classical pathway `$C_3$` convertase is the complex `$C4b2a$`. Since component `$C_2$` is completely absent, the `$C4b2a$` complex cannot be formed. Consequently, the classical pathway is entirely blocked at a step prior to `$C_3$` cleavage. All functions dependent on this pathway, such as antibody-mediated complement activation and clearance of immune complexes via erythrocyte CR1, will be impaired.\n\n2.  **Lectin Pathway**: This pathway is initiated when mannose-binding lectin (MBL) or ficolins bind to specific carbohydrate patterns on pathogen surfaces. This activates MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs), specifically MASP-2, which functions analogously to activated `$C1s$`. MASP-2 cleaves `$C_4$` and `$C_2$`. The subsequent formation of the lectin pathway `$C_3$` convertase is identical to the classical pathway: it is the `$C4b2a$` complex. Due to the complete deficiency of `$C_2$`, this convertase cannot be formed. Therefore, the lectin pathway is also entirely blocked.\n\n3.  **Alternative Pathway**: This pathway is initiated by the spontaneous low-level hydrolysis of `$C_3$` to `$C_3(H_2O)$`, or more relevantly here, by the binding of pre-existing `$C_{3b}$` to a permissive surface, such as the specified Gram-negative bacteria. Surface-bound `$C_{3b}$` binds Factor B. This `$C3bB$` complex is then acted upon by Factor D, which cleaves Factor B into `$B_a$` and `$B_b$`. The resulting complex, `$C3bBb$`, is the alternative pathway `$C_3$` convertase. This convertase is stabilized by properdin. The problem states that `$C_3$`, Factor B, Factor D, and properdin are all present at normal levels. Crucially, the formation of `$C3bBb$` does not require `$C_2$`. Therefore, the alternative pathway remains fully functional.\n\n**Analysis of Effector Functions**:\n- **`$C_{3b}$` Deposition (Opsonization) and `$C_{3a}$` Generation**: The functional alternative pathway `$C_3$` convertase (`$C3bBb$`) will cleave `$C_3$` into `$C_{3a}$` and `$C_{3b}$`. `$C_{3b}$` will be deposited on the bacterial surface, acting as an opsonin. `$C_{3a}$` will be released as an anaphylatoxin.\n- **`$C_5$` Convertase Formation**: The alternative pathway `$C_5$` convertase is formed when an additional `$C_{3b}$` molecule associates with the `$C_3$` convertase, forming the complex `$(C_{3b})_2Bb$` (sometimes written `$C3bBbC3b$`). This formation does not require `$C_2$`. In contrast, the classical/lectin pathway `$C_5$` convertase, `$C4b2a3b$`, cannot be formed due to the lack of `$C_2$`.\n- **`$C_{5a}$` Generation and MAC Assembly**: The functional alternative pathway `$C_5$` convertase, `$(C_{3b})_2Bb$`, will cleave `$C_5$` (which is present in normal amounts) into `$C_{5a}$` and `$C_{5b}$`. `$C_{5a}$` is a potent anaphylatoxin and chemoattractant. `$C_{5b}$` initiates the assembly of the terminal Membrane Attack Complex (MAC, `$C5b-9$`) by recruiting `$C_6, C_7, C_8$`, and `$C_9$` (all stated to be normal).\n- **Immune Complex Clearance**: This process is primarily mediated by the classical pathway, which opsonizes immune complexes with `$C_{4b}$` and `$C_{3b}$`. These tagged complexes bind to CR1 on erythrocytes and are transported to the liver and spleen for disposal. As the classical pathway is ablated due to `$C_2$` deficiency, this critical function is severely impaired.\n\n**Summary of Predictions**:\n- **Active Pathway(s)**: Only the alternative pathway.\n- **Blocked Pathway(s)**: Classical and Lectin pathways.\n- **`$C_{3b}$` Deposition**: Yes, via the alternative pathway.\n- **`$C_{3a}$`/`$C_{5a}$` Generation**: Yes, via the alternative pathway.\n- **MAC Formation**: Yes, via the alternative pathway.\n- **Impaired Functions**: Antibody-dependent activation (classical), MBL-dependent activation (lectin), and immune complex clearance (classical).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Only the alternative pathway can generate surface `$C_{3b}$`; the classical and lectin pathways are ablated. Antibody-triggered complement functions and mannose-binding lectin (MBL)-triggered opsonization are impaired, as is immune complex clearance via erythrocyte CR1; however, on permissive bacterial surfaces, membrane attack complex formation and anaphylatoxin generation can still proceed via the alternative pathway.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the derivation. It correctly identifies that only the alternative pathway is functional. It correctly identifies that the `$C_2$`-dependent classical and lectin pathways are blocked, leading to impaired antibody-dependent functions, MBL-triggered functions, and immune complex clearance. It also correctly states that the alternative pathway can proceed to generate anaphylatoxins (`$C_{3a}, C_{5a}$`) and the MAC.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. No complement pathway can generate `$C_{3b}$`; opsonization, anaphylatoxin generation, and membrane attack complex assembly are abolished across the board.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It fails to recognize that the alternative pathway is independent of `$C_2$` and remains functional.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The lectin pathway remains fully active because it does not require `$C_2$`; the classical and alternative pathways are defective.**\nThis statement contains multiple errors. The lectin pathway explicitly requires `$C_2$` to form its `$C_3$` convertase (`$C4b2a$`). The alternative pathway is not defective; it is the only functional pathway in this scenario.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Both the alternative and lectin pathways can generate `$C_{3b}$` because both are antibody-independent; only antibody-dependent functions are impaired, while membrane attack complex formation and immune complex clearance are unaffected.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The lectin pathway is not active due to the `$C_2$` deficiency. Furthermore, immune complex clearance is severely impaired because it depends on the now-defunct classical pathway.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The alternative pathway can deposit `$C_{3b}$` but cannot form a `$C_5$` convertase without `$C_2$`; thus membrane attack complex formation and `$C_{5a}$` production are absent, whereas `$C_{3b}$`-dependent opsonization remains intact.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The formation of the alternative pathway `$C_5$` convertase, `$(C_{3b})_2Bb$`, does not involve `$C_2$`. The premise that a `$C_5$` convertase cannot be formed is false, and therefore the conclusion that MAC formation and `$C_{5a}$` production are absent is also false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2896723"}, {"introduction": "One of the cardinal signs of acute inflammation—swelling, or edema—is a direct result of changes in microvascular fluid exchange.

Consider a single-exchange microvascular unit in which the net volume flux of solvent across the wall is determined by (i) the difference in hydrostatic pressures between capillary and interstitium, (ii) the difference in colloid osmotic pressures between capillary plasma and interstitial fluid, and (iii) barrier properties that scale how these forces are transmitted to the solvent.\n\nLet $P_c$ denote capillary hydrostatic pressure, $P_i$ interstitial hydrostatic pressure, $\\pi_c$ capillary colloid osmotic pressure, and $\\pi_i$ interstitial colloid osmotic pressure.

All necessary data are provided, and the premises are consistent with established principles of microvascular physiology and transport phenomena. No flaws are identified. We may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the net solvent volume flux, $J_v$, across a capillary wall. This phenomenon is governed by the principles of linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The flux of a substance is linearly proportional to its conjugate thermodynamic driving force. For solvent (water) flow across a membrane, the flux is the volume flux $J_v$, and the driving force is the net pressure difference across the membrane.\n\nThe total pressure difference is composed of two components: the hydrostatic pressure difference, $\\Delta P$, and the colloid osmotic (oncotic) pressure difference, $\\Delta \\pi$.\n\nThe hydrostatic pressure difference is given by $\\Delta P = P_c - P_i$, where $P_c$ is the capillary hydrostatic pressure and $P_i$ is the interstitial hydrostatic pressure. This term represents a mechanical force pushing fluid out of the capillary.\n\nThe colloid osmotic pressure difference is given by $\\Delta \\pi = \\pi_c - \\pi_i$, where $\\pi_c$ is the capillary colloid osmotic pressure and $\\pi_i$ is the interstitial colloid osmotic pressure. This term represents a chemical potential-driven force that tends to draw water into the compartment with higher solute (protein) concentration, i.e., into the capillary.\n\nHowever, the capillary wall is not a perfect semipermeable membrane; it is partially permeable to plasma proteins. The Staverman reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$, accounts for this partial permeability. It is a dimensionless parameter where $\\sigma = 1$ signifies a membrane completely impermeable to the solute, allowing the full osmotic pressure difference to be expressed. Conversely, $\\sigma = 0$ signifies a membrane freely permeable to the solute, resulting in no effective osmotic pressure difference across the membrane. The effective colloid osmotic pressure that opposes filtration is therefore $\\sigma \\Delta \\pi = \\sigma (\\pi_c - \\pi_i)$.\n\nThe net pressure driving filtration, $P_{net}$, is the sum of the hydrostatic forces promoting filtration and the effective osmotic forces opposing it.\n$$P_{net} = (P_c - P_i) - \\sigma (\\pi_c - \\pi_i)$$\nThe linear phenomenological law states that the volume flux $J_v$ is directly proportional to this net pressure. The constant of proportionality is the hydraulic filtration coefficient, $K_f$, which incorporates the permeability of the wall to water and the surface area available for exchange.\n$$J_v = K_f \\times P_{net}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_{net}$, we arrive at the Starling equation for transcapillary fluid exchange, which is the required expression derived from first principles:\n$$J_v = K_f [ (P_c - P_i) - \\sigma (\\pi_c - \\pi_i) ]$$\nNow, we compute the numerical values for $J_v$ before and after the histamine pulse using the provided data.

The design must rely only on caspase inhibitors, propidium iodide (PI), and Annexin V, and the justification for each marker’s use must be scientifically grounded. The researcher can trigger canonical inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis through lipopolysaccharide (LPS) priming followed by nigericin, and apoptosis through staurosporine. Three caspase inhibitors are available: the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk), the caspase-1-selective Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone (YVAD-cmk), and the caspase-3-selective Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-CHO (DEVD-CHO).

Apoptosis is a non-lytic programmed cell death driven by executioner caspases (caspase-3 and caspase-7), with early plasma membrane integrity preserved.\n- Annexin V binds externalized phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, a hallmark of early apoptosis; pyroptotic cells can also bind Annexin V but typically coincide quickly with membrane permeabilization.

Run two parallel stimulations: canonical pyroptosis by LPS plus nigericin and apoptosis by staurosporine. For each, include vehicle, zVAD-fmk, YVAD-cmk, and DEVD-CHO conditions. Acquire Annexin V and PI by flow cytometry at $0$, $30$, $60$, $120$, and $240$ minutes.

It is a standard, well-formulated question in experimental design within immunology. A rigorous solution can be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal is to design an experiment that unambiguously distinguishes two distinct cell death pathways. A robust experimental design must be based on the fundamental differences between pyroptosis and apoptosis, as stated in the provided facts. These differences manifest in three key domains: ($1$) the molecular mediators, specifically the initiating and executing caspases; ($2$) the kinetics of cell death; and ($3$) the sequence of plasma membrane alterations.\n\n1.  **Caspase Dependency**: Canonical pyroptosis is dependent on caspase-1. Apoptosis is dependent on executioner caspases like caspase-3. A conclusive experiment must therefore use inhibitors selective for these respective caspases to demonstrate this differential dependency. `YVAD-cmk` should inhibit pyroptosis but not apoptosis, while `DEVD-CHO` should inhibit apoptosis but not pyroptosis. The pan-caspase inhibitor, `zVAD-fmk`, should inhibit both, serving as a control for caspase-mediated death.\n\n2.  **Kinetics**: Pyroptosis is a rapid, lytic event due to gasdermin D pore formation. Apoptosis proceeds through a more controlled, slower sequence, beginning with an \"early\" phase where the membrane is intact, followed by a \"late\" phase of secondary necrosis. To capture this temporal difference, measurements must be taken at multiple time points, including early ones (e.g., `30`–`60` minutes) and later ones (e.g., `120`–`240` minutes).\n\n3.  **Membrane Staining Profile**: The combination of `Annexin V` and `PI` is essential.\n    -   _Apoptosis_: Characterized by an initial `Annexin V`$^+$/`PI`$^-$ population (externalized `PS`, intact membrane), which then progresses to a double-positive `Annexin V`$^+$/`PI`$^+$ state (secondary necrosis).\n    -   _Pyroptosis_: Characterized by the rapid, near-simultaneous appearance of a double-positive `Annexin V`$^+$/`PI`$^+$ population, as lytic pore formation allows both `PI` entry and `$Ca^{2+}$` influx that triggers `PS` scrambling. A stable `Annexin V`$^+$/`PI`$^-$ intermediate is not characteristic of pyroptosis.\n\nAn optimal experimental design must integrate all three of these principles.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**Option A:**\n-   **Experimental Design**: Proposes parallel stimulation, a full panel of inhibitors (`zVAD-fmk`, `YVAD-cmk`, `DEVD-CHO`, and vehicle), and a time course (`0`, `30`, `60`, `120`, `240` minutes) with `Annexin V` and `PI` readout. This design is comprehensive, addressing all three core principles: differential caspase dependency, kinetics, and membrane integrity profiles.\n-   **Interpretation and Justification**: The predicted outcomes are correct. Pyroptosis is defined as rapid `Annexin V`$^+$/`PI`$^+$ cell death, sensitive to `YVAD-cmk` and `zVAD-fmk`, but not `DEVD-CHO`. Apoptosis is defined as an initial `Annexin V`$^+$/`PI`$^-$ stage transitioning to `Annexin V`$^+$/`PI`$^+$ later, sensitive to `DEVD-CHO` and `zVAD-fmk`, but not `YVAD-cmk`. The justifications for using each marker and inhibitor are scientifically accurate.\n-   **Verdict**: This option presents a rigorous, complete, and logically sound experimental plan that would successfully distinguish the two pathways. It is **Correct**.\n\n**Option B:**\n-   **Experimental Design**: Proposes using only the pan-caspase inhibitor `zVAD-fmk` and a single, late time point (`240` minutes). This design is critically flawed. Without the specific inhibitors for caspase-1 and caspase-3, it is impossible to attribute the cell death to one pathway over the other. A single late time point obscures the crucial kinetic differences, as by `240` minutes, many apoptotic cells would be `Annexin V`$^+$/`PI`$^+$, mimicking the pyroptotic phenotype.\n-   **Interpretation and Justification**: The interpretation is factually incorrect. It states that `Annexin V`$^+$/`PI`$^-$ cells are pyroptotic, which contradicts the established profile of apoptosis. It claims `Annexin V`$^-$/`PI`$^+$ cells are apoptotic, which is also incorrect; this profile may represent primary necrosis, not apoptosis. The justification that \"`Annexin V` detects pyroptosis and `PI` detects apoptosis\" is a nonsensical oversimplification.\n-   **Verdict**: This option is based on a flawed design and incorrect scientific reasoning. It is **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C:**\n-   **Experimental Design**: Proposes using only `PI` as a readout, omits the specific caspase-1 inhibitor `YVAD-cmk`, and uses a single time point (`120` minutes). This design is insufficient. By omitting `Annexin V`, it loses the ability to identify the hallmark early apoptotic `Annexin V`$^+$/`PI`$^-$ population. By omitting `YVAD-cmk`, it fails to provide direct evidence for caspase-1 dependence in the pyroptotic arm.\n-   **Interpretation and Justification**: The reasoning is inverted and factually wrong. It claims that a reduction in `PI` positivity by `DEVD-CHO` (a caspase-3 inhibitor) identifies pyroptosis. `DEVD-CHO` should inhibit apoptosis, not pyroptosis. The justification that `PI` alone suffices is flawed, as it ignores the critical temporal and sequential differences between the pathways.\n-   **Verdict**: This option features a poor experimental design and a scientifically invalid interpretation. It is **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D:**\n-   **Experimental Design**: Proposes using only the caspase-1 inhibitor `YVAD-cmk` and a single, very early time point (`30` minutes). This design is too limited. While testing with `YVAD-cmk` is useful, the absence of `DEVD-CHO` means the experiment cannot confirm caspase-3 dependence of apoptosis. A single, very early time point is unreliable; `30` minutes may be too soon to detect a significant apoptotic population, leading to a false-negative result.\n-   **Interpretation and Justification**: The interpretation is confused. It suggests that inhibiting \"`Annexin V` positivity\" with `YVAD-cmk` identifies apoptosis. `YVAD-cmk` inhibits caspase-1 and thus pyroptosis, not apoptosis. The justification that \"`early `Annexin V` alone distinguishes the modalities`\" is incorrect because pyroptotic cells also become `Annexin V` positive, and timing and co-staining with `PI` are essential.\n-   **Verdict**: This option's design is insufficient and its interpretation is flawed. It is **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, Option A is the only one that proposes a scientifically rigorous and comprehensive experiment capable of unambiguously distinguishing canonical pyroptosis from apoptosis based on the provided principles and tools.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2896728"}]}
