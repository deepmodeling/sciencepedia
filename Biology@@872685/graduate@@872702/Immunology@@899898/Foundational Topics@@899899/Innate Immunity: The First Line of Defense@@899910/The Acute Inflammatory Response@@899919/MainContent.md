## Introduction
The [acute inflammatory response](@entry_id:193187) is a fundamental pillar of innate immunity, a rapid and powerful defense mechanism designed to eliminate threats and initiate [tissue repair](@entry_id:189995). However, this essential process is a double-edged sword; when dysregulated, it can drive devastating tissue damage and life-threatening diseases. Understanding the intricate choreography of this response—from the first molecular signals of danger to the active programs that restore balance—is critical for modern medicine and biology. This article serves as a graduate-level guide to this complex system. The first chapter, "Principles and Mechanisms," dissects the core molecular pathways and cellular events that govern inflammation. The second, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections," explores how these principles manifest in diverse physiological contexts and disease states, from [neuroinflammation](@entry_id:166850) to [sepsis](@entry_id:156058). Finally, "Hands-On Practices" provides opportunities to apply this knowledge to solve experimental and conceptual problems, solidifying your understanding of this vital biological process.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The [acute inflammatory response](@entry_id:193187) is a dynamic and tightly regulated process that unfolds through a sequence of distinct yet overlapping phases: initiation, amplification and effector function, and finally, active resolution. This chapter will dissect the core principles and molecular mechanisms that govern each of these phases, from the initial sensing of danger to the ultimate restoration of [tissue homeostasis](@entry_id:156191). We will explore how sentinel cells recognize threats, how the vasculature is remodeled to facilitate an influx of fluid and leukocytes, how these leukocytes are recruited to the precise site of injury, and how this powerful response is actively terminated to prevent chronic damage.

### Initiation: The Sensing of Danger

The inflammatory cascade is not triggered arbitrarily; it is initiated by the recognition of specific molecular cues that signify the presence of microbial invasion or host cell injury. The [innate immune system](@entry_id:201771) has evolved a sophisticated repertoire of germline-encoded receptors to perform this crucial surveillance task.

#### Pathogen- and Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs)

The molecular triggers of [acute inflammation](@entry_id:181503) are broadly categorized into two classes. **Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)** are conserved molecular structures unique to microorganisms and essential for their survival, yet absent from host cells. Their recognition by the innate immune system forms the basis of non-self discrimination. A canonical example is **[lipopolysaccharide](@entry_id:188695) (LPS)**, a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. In contrast, **[damage-associated molecular patterns](@entry_id:199940) (DAMPs)**, also known as alarmins, are endogenous molecules that are released or exposed by host cells upon injury, stress, or necrotic death. Under normal physiological conditions, these molecules are sequestered within cells. Their appearance in the extracellular space serves as a powerful signal of tissue damage. A classic DAMP is extracellular **adenosine triphosphate (ATP)**, which is found at high concentrations inside healthy cells but is released into the milieu upon cell lysis [@problem_id:2896697].

#### Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs)

The detection of PAMPs and DAMPs is mediated by a set of proteins known as **[pattern recognition receptors](@entry_id:146710) (PRRs)**. These receptors are strategically positioned to survey different cellular compartments, including the cell surface, endosomes, and the cytosol. Major families of PRRs include the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and AIM2-like receptors (ALRs).

##### Toll-Like Receptors: Extracellular and Endosomal Surveillance

**Toll-like receptors (TLRs)** are [transmembrane proteins](@entry_id:175222) that play a central role in initiating responses to extracellular and ingested microbes. Their activation leads to the recruitment of intracellular adaptor proteins via conserved **Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)** domains, triggering [signaling cascades](@entry_id:265811) that culminate in the activation of key transcription factors. The specificity of TLR signaling is determined by the receptor itself, its subcellular location, and the specific adaptor proteins it recruits [@problem_id:2896702].

There are two major signaling pathways downstream of TLRs, defined by the primary adaptor protein used: the MyD88-dependent pathway and the TRIF-dependent pathway.

*   The **MyD88-dependent pathway** is utilized by all TLRs except for TLR3. It is defined by the recruitment of the adaptor protein **Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88)**. This leads to the rapid activation of the transcription factor **nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)** and mitogen-activated [protein kinases](@entry_id:171134) (MAPKs), driving the expression of a host of early proinflammatory cytokines such as [tumor necrosis factor](@entry_id:153212) (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1). For TLRs located at the plasma membrane, such as the TLR1/TLR2/TLR6 heterodimers that recognize bacterial [lipoproteins](@entry_id:165681), the recruitment of MyD88 is often bridged by a sorting adaptor, TIRAP.

*   The **TRIF-dependent pathway** is defined by the adaptor protein **TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)**. This pathway is exclusively used by TLR3 (which senses viral double-stranded RNA in endosomes) and secondarily by TLR4. The key outcome of TRIF signaling is the activation of the transcription factor **interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)**, which drives the production of **type I [interferons](@entry_id:164293) (IFN-α/β)**, a critical component of the [antiviral response](@entry_id:192218). TRIF can also activate NF-κB, but with delayed kinetics compared to the MyD88 pathway.

The location and ligand specificity of TLRs are crucial for their function. For instance, **Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)** is located within endolysosomes, where it can survey the contents of phagocytosed microbes. It specifically recognizes unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) motifs, which are abundant in bacterial and viral DNA but rare and typically methylated in vertebrate DNA. This difference in methylation status allows TLR9 to distinguish microbial from host DNA [@problem_id:2896697].

**Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)** provides a fascinating example of how a single receptor can utilize both major signaling pathways from different cellular compartments. At the [plasma membrane](@entry_id:145486), TLR4, in complex with its co-receptors MD-2 and CD14, recognizes the hexa-acylated lipid A portion of LPS. This recognition, which involves the precise fitting of lipid A's six acyl chains into a hydrophobic pocket on MD-2, triggers the MyD88-dependent pathway for rapid proinflammatory [cytokine](@entry_id:204039) production. Following activation, the TLR4 complex can be endocytosed. Within the endosome, it switches adaptors, recruiting TRIF (via the sorting adaptor TRAM) to initiate the TRIF-dependent pathway, leading to type I interferon production [@problem_id:2896702] [@problem_id:2896697].

##### Cytosolic Sensors and the Inflammasome

While TLRs police the extracellular and endosomal spaces, the cytosol is monitored by other PRR families, including the NLRs and ALRs. Upon detecting their specific ligands, certain members of these families can assemble large, cytosolic multiprotein platforms known as **inflammasomes**.

A canonical [inflammasome](@entry_id:178345) consists of three core components: a sensor PRR, an adaptor protein, and an effector pro-caspase. The universal adaptor for most inflammasomes is **Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC)**, which contains two distinct [protein-protein interaction](@entry_id:271634) domains: a pyrin domain (PYD) and a caspase recruitment domain (CARD). The effector is typically **pro-caspase-1**. Assembly occurs via homotypic interactions: the sensor's PYD binds to ASC's PYD, and ASC's CARD then recruits the CARD of pro-caspase-1. This clustering leads to the proximity-induced auto-activation of caspase-1. Active caspase-1 is a protease that cleaves key substrates, most notably the pro-inflammatory [cytokines](@entry_id:156485) pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, into their mature, secretable forms.

A comparison between the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes highlights the different strategies for cytosolic sensing [@problem_id:2896670]:

*   The **NLRP3 [inflammasome](@entry_id:178345)** is an archetype of indirect sensing. Its sensor, **NLRP3**, does not appear to bind directly to any single PAMP or DAMP. Instead, it senses a wide array of disparate stimuli that converge on a common downstream cellular stress signal. A unifying trigger for NLRP3 activation is the efflux of potassium ions ($K^+$) from the cell. For example, high concentrations of extracellular ATP (a DAMP) bind to the P2X7 purinergic receptor on the cell surface, opening an ion channel that leads to massive $K^+$ efflux and subsequent NLRP3 activation. Activation of NLRP3 is a tightly regulated two-step process. A "priming" signal (Signal 1), often from a TLR, is required to induce NF-κB-dependent transcription of both `NLRP3` and `IL1B` (the gene for pro-IL-1β). The second signal (Signal 2), such as $K^+$ efflux or lysosomal rupture, then triggers the assembly of the inflammasome, a process which requires the essential [cofactor](@entry_id:200224) **NEK7**.

*   The **AIM2 inflammasome** represents a model of direct ligand sensing. Its sensor, **Absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2)**, is a direct receptor for cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), a potent signal for viral or bacterial infection, or for host cell damage. AIM2 uses its C-terminal HIN-200 domain to bind directly to the sugar-phosphate backbone of dsDNA. This [ligand binding](@entry_id:147077) event is the primary trigger that induces AIM2 oligomerization and subsequent recruitment of ASC to assemble the inflammasome. Unlike NLRP3, its activation is not dependent on $K^+$ efflux. However, like NLRP3, a priming signal is typically required to ensure that the substrate, pro-IL-1β, is available for processing by the activated caspase-1 [@problem_id:2896670].

### The Effector Response: Local and Systemic Manifestations

Once sentinel cells are activated, they orchestrate the inflammatory response by releasing a battery of soluble mediators, including [cytokines](@entry_id:156485), chemokines, and lipids. These mediators act both locally to orchestrate the [cardinal signs of inflammation](@entry_id:196046) (redness, heat, swelling, pain) and systemically to mount a whole-body response.

#### Proinflammatory Cytokines: TNF, IL-1, and IL-6

Among the first and most important cytokines released by activated [macrophages](@entry_id:172082) and dendritic cells are **Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)**, **Interleukin-1 (IL-1)**, and **Interleukin-6 (IL-6)**. While their functions overlap, they also have distinct and characteristic local and systemic roles [@problem_id:2896733].

*   **Local Effects**: TNF and IL-1 are the principal architects of the local inflammatory environment. They act on the endothelial cells lining local postcapillary venules, inducing profound changes. They promote **endothelial activation**, leading to the upregulation of adhesion molecules that are essential for recruiting leukocytes from the blood (discussed in detail later). They also cause endothelial cell contraction and disrupt junctional integrity, leading to **increased vascular permeability**. This vascular leak allows plasma fluid and proteins to enter the tissue, causing [edema](@entry_id:153997).

*   **Systemic Effects**: When these [cytokines](@entry_id:156485) enter the circulation, they mediate the systemic [acute-phase response](@entry_id:150078).
    *   **Fever**: All three [cytokines](@entry_id:156485) are endogenous pyrogens, acting on the [hypothalamus](@entry_id:152284) in the brain to increase the body's thermoregulatory set-point via the production of prostaglandin $E_2$ ($PGE_2$).
    *   **Acute-Phase Protein Synthesis**: IL-6 is the principal driver of the [acute-phase response](@entry_id:150078) in the liver. It acts on hepatocytes, primarily via JAK-STAT3 signaling, to induce the synthesis and secretion of **acute-phase reactants** such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA). TNF and IL-1 contribute to this response but IL-6 plays the dominant role.
    *   **Leukocytosis**: TNF and IL-1 act on the bone marrow to stimulate the accelerated production and release of leukocytes, particularly neutrophils, into the circulation.
    *   **Pathological Effects**: In cases of severe systemic infection ([sepsis](@entry_id:156058)), the massive, uncontrolled release of TNF can be catastrophic. It can cause systemic [vasodilation](@entry_id:150952), leading to a precipitous drop in [blood pressure](@entry_id:177896) (hypotension), and can trigger widespread activation of the coagulation system, leading to disseminated intravascular [coagulation](@entry_id:202447) (DIC). This constellation of effects constitutes [septic shock](@entry_id:174400).

#### Vascular Permeability and Edema

The swelling (edema) characteristic of [acute inflammation](@entry_id:181503) is a direct consequence of the increased vascular permeability induced by mediators like TNF, IL-1, and [histamine](@entry_id:173823). The movement of fluid across the microvascular endothelium is governed by the balance of hydrostatic and colloid osmotic (oncotic) pressures, as described by the **Starling equation**:

$J_v = K_f [ (P_c - P_i) - \sigma (\pi_c - \pi_i) ]$

Here, $J_v$ is the net fluid flux, $K_f$ is the [hydraulic conductance](@entry_id:165048) (a measure of permeability to water), $P_c$ and $P_i$ are the hydrostatic pressures in the capillary and interstitium, respectively, $\pi_c$ and $\pi_i$ are the oncotic pressures of the capillary plasma and interstitium, and $\sigma$ is the protein reflection coefficient (an index of the barrier's leakiness to protein, where $\sigma=1$ is impermeable and $\sigma=0$ is freely permeable).

Inflammation dramatically alters this balance to favor the net movement of fluid out of the vessel ([filtration](@entry_id:162013)) [@problem_id:2896665]:
1.  **Increased Capillary Hydrostatic Pressure ($P_c \uparrow$)**: Inflammatory mediators cause upstream arteriolar [vasodilation](@entry_id:150952), increasing [blood flow](@entry_id:148677) into the capillary bed and raising the pressure within it.
2.  **Increased Hydraulic Conductance ($K_f \uparrow$)**: Endothelial cell contraction creates gaps between cells, increasing the vessel wall's overall permeability to water.
3.  **Decreased Protein Reflection Coefficient ($\sigma \downarrow$)**: The formation of these inter-endothelial gaps makes the barrier leaky to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. As the barrier becomes less effective at retaining protein, $\sigma$ decreases.
4.  **Increased Interstitial Oncotic Pressure ($\pi_i \uparrow$)**: The leakage of plasma proteins into the interstitial space raises the protein concentration there, increasing its oncotic pull.

The combined effect of these changes is a powerful driving force for fluid [filtration](@entry_id:162013) into the tissue. The resulting fluid, which is rich in plasma proteins due to the leaky barrier, is termed an **exudate**. This is distinct from a **transudate**, a low-protein fluid that forms when the endothelial barrier is intact ($\sigma \approx 1$) but the hydrostatic or oncotic pressure balance is altered (e.g., in congestive heart failure or liver failure).

#### The Complement System

Operating in parallel with cellular activation is the **complement system**, a powerful humoral cascade of over 30 plasma proteins that can be activated at the site of inflammation. Activation proceeds via a [proteolytic cascade](@entry_id:172851), where inactive [zymogens](@entry_id:146857) are cleaved to become active proteases. There are three main initiation pathways that converge on a common set of [effector functions](@entry_id:193819) [@problem_id:2896718].

*   **The Classical Pathway**: This pathway provides a link between the innate and adaptive immune systems. It is typically initiated when the recognition component, `$C1q$`, binds to the Fc regions of antibodies (IgM or clustered IgG) that are already bound to a pathogen or antigen. This binding activates the associated proteases `$C1r$` and `$C1s$`.

*   **The Lectin Pathway**: This is an antibody-independent pathway of [innate immunity](@entry_id:137209). It is initiated when pattern recognition molecules, such as **[mannose-binding lectin](@entry_id:178609) (MBL)** or **ficolins**, bind to specific carbohydrate structures (e.g., mannose) on the surface of [microorganisms](@entry_id:164403). This activates MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs), particularly MASP-2.

*   **The Alternative Pathway**: This pathway provides a constant, low-level surveillance mechanism. It can be initiated through the spontaneous hydrolysis of the central complement component, `$C_3$`, in the plasma, a process called "tickover." This generates a short-lived fluid-phase enzyme that can deposit nascent `$C_{3b}$` onto nearby surfaces. On host cells, this is rapidly inactivated. On microbial surfaces, which lack regulatory proteins, this deposited `$C_{3b}$` can initiate a powerful amplification loop.

All three pathways converge on the generation of a **`$C_3$` convertase**. The classical and lectin pathways form the `$C_3$` convertase **`$C4b2a$`**. The alternative pathway forms the `$C_3$` convertase **`$C3bBb$`**. These enzymes cleave vast quantities of `$C_3$` into `$C_{3a}$` and `$C_{3b}$`. The binding of a `$C_{3b}$` molecule to the `$C_3$` convertase transforms it into a **`$C_5$` convertase** (**`$C4b2a3b$`** for the classical/[lectin pathway](@entry_id:174287), **`$C3bBb3b$`** for the alternative pathway), which then cleaves `$C_5$`. The key outcomes of this cascade are:
1.  **Opsonization**: `$C_{3b}$` fragments coat pathogen surfaces, tagging them for phagocytosis.
2.  **Inflammation**: The small cleavage fragments `$C_{3a}$` and `$C_{5a}$` act as potent **[anaphylatoxins](@entry_id:183599)**, promoting [vasodilation](@entry_id:150952), increased vascular permeability, and [chemotaxis](@entry_id:149822) of leukocytes.
3.  **Cell Lysis**: `$C_{5b}$` initiates the assembly of the **[membrane attack complex](@entry_id:149884) (MAC)**, which can form pores in the membranes of certain pathogens, leading to their lysis.

### Cellular Recruitment: The Leukocyte Adhesion Cascade

A central event in [acute inflammation](@entry_id:181503) is the recruitment of leukocytes, primarily [neutrophils](@entry_id:173698), from the bloodstream into the extravascular tissue. This process, known as extravasation, is a highly orchestrated, multi-step process termed the **[leukocyte adhesion cascade](@entry_id:203604)**. It allows circulating leukocytes to slow down, adhere firmly to the vessel wall, and migrate through the endothelium, all against the substantial shear forces of blood flow [@problem_id:2896687].

The cascade proceeds through the following sequential steps:

1.  **Tethering and Rolling**: Passing [neutrophils](@entry_id:173698) are first captured from the fluid stream and begin to roll along the endothelial surface. This initial, transient adhesion is mediated by **[selectins](@entry_id:184160)**. Inflammatory [cytokines](@entry_id:156485) (like TNF and IL-1) induce the expression of **E-selectin** and **P-selectin** on [endothelial cells](@entry_id:262884). These [selectins](@entry_id:184160) possess lectin domains that bind to specific sialylated carbohydrate ligands, such as **P-selectin Glycoprotein Ligand-1 (PSGL-1)**, on the surface of [neutrophils](@entry_id:173698). The rapid on-rate and moderate off-rate kinetics of these bonds are perfectly suited to mediate rolling rather than immediate arrest.

2.  **Activation and Integrin Conformational Change**: As the neutrophil rolls along the endothelium, it samples the surface for activating signals. These signals are primarily **chemokines** (e.g., **CXCL8**, also known as IL-8) that have been produced in the tissue and are now presented on the endothelial surface, bound to [glycosaminoglycans](@entry_id:173906). The chemokine binds to its specific **G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)** (e.g., **CXCR1/2** for CXCL8) on the [neutrophil](@entry_id:182534). This engagement triggers a rapid and potent [intracellular signaling](@entry_id:170800) cascade, known as **[inside-out signaling](@entry_id:165538)**.

3.  **Integrin Activation: A Deep Dive into Inside-Out Signaling**: The purpose of [inside-out signaling](@entry_id:165538) is to convert **integrins**, the key adhesion receptors for firm arrest, from a default low-affinity state to a high-affinity state. Neutrophils primarily use the β2 integrins **LFA-1** (CD11a/CD18) and **Mac-1** (CD11b/CD18). In their inactive state, these integrins adopt a bent, closed conformation. Chemokine [receptor signaling](@entry_id:197910) activates a small GTPase, **Rap1**. Activated Rap1-GTP then recruits a cascade of effector proteins to the integrin's cytoplasmic tail. A key event is the recruitment of the protein **talin**, which binds to the β-chain of the integrin. This binding event mechanically separates the cytoplasmic tails of the α and β chains, which in turn triggers a large-scale [conformational change](@entry_id:185671) in the integrin's extracellular domain, causing it to extend and its ligand-binding headpiece to open. This shift dramatically increases the integrin's affinity for its ligand (lowers the [dissociation constant](@entry_id:265737), $K_D$). Concurrently, another protein, **kindlin**, also binds the β-tail and cooperates with talin to stabilize the high-affinity state and, critically, to link the integrin to the [actin cytoskeleton](@entry_id:267743) and promote lateral clustering of integrins on the cell surface. This clustering increases the overall binding strength, or **avidity**. In a hypothetical talin-deficient [neutrophil](@entry_id:182534), the critical step of integrin affinity maturation would fail. While rolling might be preserved, the [neutrophil](@entry_id:182534) would be unable to execute chemokine-triggered firm arrest on the endothelium, especially under physiological shear forces [@problem_id:2896726].

4.  **Arrest (Firm Adhesion)**: The now high-affinity integrins on the neutrophil bind tightly to their ligands on the endothelial surface. The main ligands for LFA-1 and Mac-1 are members of the [immunoglobulin superfamily](@entry_id:195049), principally **Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1)**, whose expression is also strongly upregulated by TNF and IL-1. The combination of high affinity and high avidity creates strong, shear-resistant adhesion, bringing the rolling neutrophil to a full stop.

5.  **Diapedesis (Transendothelial Migration)**: The arrested neutrophil then crawls along the endothelial surface to find a suitable site to cross into the tissue, typically at an endothelial cell-cell junction. This process of transmigration is guided by another set of adhesion molecules localized at these junctions, including **Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (PECAM-1)** and **Junctional Adhesion Molecules (JAMs)**. The leukocyte squeezes between the endothelial cells and breaches the basement membrane to enter the tissue, guided by the chemokine gradient towards the site of injury.

### Resolution: The Active Termination of Inflammation

An effective [inflammatory response](@entry_id:166810) must not only be initiated robustly but also be terminated in a timely manner. Failure to resolve inflammation can lead to chronic inflammatory diseases and excessive tissue damage. The **[resolution of inflammation](@entry_id:185395)** is not a passive decay of pro-inflammatory signals but an active, highly coordinated biological program designed to restore tissue structure and function [@problem_id:2896691]. It is fundamentally different from pharmacological [immunosuppression](@entry_id:151329), which may halt inflammation but can also impair healing and pro-resolving pathways.

The cardinal features of active resolution include:

#### Cellular Clearance and Macrophage Reprogramming

As the response progresses, recruited neutrophils, which are inherently short-lived, undergo [programmed cell death](@entry_id:145516) (**apoptosis**). It is critical that these apoptotic cells are swiftly cleared by phagocytes, predominantly tissue [macrophages](@entry_id:172082), in a process termed **[efferocytosis](@entry_id:191608)**. This is a non-inflammatory clearance mechanism that prevents the apoptotic neutrophils from undergoing secondary [necrosis](@entry_id:266267), a process that would release their cytotoxic contents and DAMPs, thereby re-igniting inflammation. Furthermore, the act of engulfing apoptotic cells actively reprograms the macrophage, shifting it from a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype to a pro-resolving and tissue-reparative M2-like phenotype. These pro-resolving macrophages release anti-inflammatory [cytokines](@entry_id:156485) like IL-10 and TGF-β and initiate [tissue repair](@entry_id:189995).

#### The Lipid Mediator Class Switch

A key molecular signature of resolution is a change in the profile of lipid mediators derived from [polyunsaturated fatty acids](@entry_id:180977). This "class switch" shifts production from pro-[inflammatory mediators](@entry_id:194567) to a family of **[specialized pro-resolving mediators](@entry_id:169750) (SPMs)** [@problem_id:2896724].

*   **Pro-inflammatory Phase**: In the early hours of inflammation, [phospholipase](@entry_id:175333) A$_2$ liberates **[arachidonic acid](@entry_id:162954) (AA)** from cell membranes. AA is then metabolized by two major enzymatic pathways. The **cyclooxygenase (COX)** pathway (involving COX-1 and the inducible COX-2) generates prostaglandin $H_2$ ($PGH_2$), which is converted into pro-inflammatory **[prostaglandins](@entry_id:201770)** (like $PGE_2$) and **thromboxanes** (like $TXA_2$). The **5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX)** pathway generates the potent neutrophil chemoattractant **leukotriene B$_4$ ($LTB_4$)**. These mediators dominate the onset of inflammation.

*   **Resolution Phase**: As inflammation progresses, the enzymatic machinery is reprogrammed. This can be driven in part by the early [prostaglandins](@entry_id:201770) themselves, which can signal to induce the expression of resolution-phase enzymes. The production of $PGE_2$ and $LTB_4$ wanes, and new classes of mediators appear. These SPMs include **[lipoxins](@entry_id:197366)**, **[resolvins](@entry_id:188202)**, **protectins**, and **maresins**. For example, **lipoxin A$_4$ ($LXA_4$)** can be generated via transcellular [biosynthesis](@entry_id:174272) when, for example, AA is first converted by **15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX)** in [macrophages](@entry_id:172082), and the product is then further processed by 5-LOX in neutrophils. Other SPMs, like [resolvins](@entry_id:188202) and protectins, are synthesized from [omega-3 fatty acids](@entry_id:165021) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Critically, many SPMs require the same enzymes used to make pro-[inflammatory mediators](@entry_id:194567); for example, 5-LOX is required to synthesize not only $LTB_4$ but also D-series [resolvins](@entry_id:188202). This highlights that resolution is not simply about shutting off enzymes, but about redirecting their activity towards a different set of products.

A unique pharmacological intervention that illuminates this process is **aspirin**. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX enzymes. However, it has a special effect on COX-2: it acetylates the active site, which does not completely abolish its activity but rather switches its product specificity. Aspirin-acetylated COX-2 converts AA into 15R-HETE, which is then rapidly converted by 5-LOX in leukocytes into **15-epi-lipoxin A$_4$**, an "aspirin-triggered" lipoxin that is a potent pro-resolving agent [@problem_id:2896724].

#### Restoration of Tissue Homeostasis

The ultimate goal of resolution is the return to a pre-inflammatory state. This involves the cessation of neutrophil infiltration, the complete clearance of apoptotic cells and [edema](@entry_id:153997) fluid (via lymphatics), the downregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules, and the active repair of the epithelial and endothelial barriers to restore their integrity and function. This active repair process, driven by pro-resolving [macrophages](@entry_id:172082) and SPMs, ensures that the tissue not only survives the inflammatory insult but is also returned to a state of health.
