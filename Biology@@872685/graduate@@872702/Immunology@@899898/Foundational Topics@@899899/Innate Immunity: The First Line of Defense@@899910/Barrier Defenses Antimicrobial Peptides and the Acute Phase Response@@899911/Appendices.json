It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of physical chemistry (Debye-Hückel theory), is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is formulated objectively. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires a quantitative analysis of the effect of ionic strength, $I$, on the electrostatic binding of two antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), AMP-X and AMP-Y, to a negatively charged bacterial membrane.\n\nThe electrostatic interaction free energy, $U_{\\mathrm{elec}}$, at a closest approach distance $d$ is given by:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{elec}}(I) = z e \\psi(d)$$\nwhere $z$ is the peptide's net charge, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $\\psi(d)$ is the electrostatic potential at distance $d$ from the membrane surface.\n\nWithin the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann (Debye-Hückel) framework for a planar surface, the potential is:\n$$\\psi(z) = \\psi_0 e^{-\\kappa z}$$\nThe surface potential $\\psi_0$ is given by $\\psi_0 = \\sigma / (\\varepsilon \\kappa)$, where $\\sigma$ is the surface charge density and $\\varepsilon$ is the permittivity of the medium.

The Debye parameter $\\kappa$ is, however, dependent on $I$. The problem provides the empirical relation for the Debye length:\n$$\\kappa^{-1}(\\mathrm{nm}) = \\frac{0.304}{\\sqrt{I(\\mathrm{M})}}$$\nLet us define the constant $C = 0.304 \\, \\mathrm{nm} \\cdot \\mathrm{M}^{1/2}$. Then $\\kappa^{-1} = C / \\sqrt{I}$, which implies $\\kappa = \\sqrt{I} / C$.\n\nWe can now express the dependence of $U_{\\mathrm{elec}}$ on $I$ explicitly:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{elec}}(I) = z e \\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon} \\left( \\frac{C}{\\sqrt{I}} \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d \\sqrt{I}}{C}\\right)$$\nWe are asked to find the scaling of this energy when the ionic strength increases from a physiological value $I_{\\mathrm{phys}} = 0.15 \\, \\mathrm{M}$ to a high-salt value $I_{\\mathrm{high}} = 0.60 \\, \\mathrm{M}$. This scaling is the ratio $S$:\n$$S = \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{elec}}(I_{\\mathrm{high}})}{U_{\\mathrm{elec}}(I_{\\mathrm{phys}})} = \\frac{z e \\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon} \\left( \\frac{C}{\\sqrt{I_{\\mathrm{high}}}} \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d \\sqrt{I_{\\mathrm{high}}}}{C}\\right)}{z e \\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon} \\left( \\frac{C}{\\sqrt{I_{\\mathrm{phys}}}} \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d \\sqrt{I_{\\mathrm{phys}}}}{C}\\right)}$$\nThe terms $z, e, \\sigma, \\varepsilon, C$ in the pre-exponential factor cancel out. This immediately shows that the fractional change in electrostatic energy is independent of the peptide's valence, $z$.\n$$S = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{I_{\\mathrm{high}}}}{1/\\sqrt{I_{\\mathrm{phys}}}} \\cdot \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{d \\sqrt{I_{\\mathrm{high}}}}{C}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{d \\sqrt{I_{\\mathrm{phys}}}}{C}\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{phys}}}{I_{\\mathrm{high}}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d}{C}(\\sqrt{I_{\\mathrm{high}}} - \\sqrt{I_{\\mathrm{phys}}})\\right)$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$I_{\\mathrm{phys}} = 0.15 \\, \\mathrm{M}$\n$I_{\\mathrm{high}} = 0.60 \\, \\mathrm{M}$\n$d = 0.5 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$\n$C = 0.304 \\, \\mathrm{nm} \\cdot \\mathrm{M}^{1/2}$\n\nFirst, the pre-exponential factor:\n$$\\sqrt{\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{phys}}}{I_{\\mathrm{high}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.15}{0.60}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}} = 0.5$$\nNext, the argument of the exponential:\n$$\\sqrt{I_{\\mathrm{phys}}} = \\sqrt{0.15} \\approx 0.3873 \\, \\mathrm{M}^{1/2}$$\n$$\\sqrt{I_{\\mathrm{high}}} = \\sqrt{0.60} \\approx 0.7746 \\, \\mathrm{M}^{1/2}$$\n$$-\\frac{d}{C}(\\sqrt{I_{\\mathrm{high}}} - \\sqrt{I_{\\mathrm{phys}}}) = -\\frac{0.5}{0.304}(0.7746 - 0.3873) \\approx -1.6447 \\times 0.3873 \\approx -0.6370$$\nThe exponential term is:\n$$\\exp(-0.6370) \\approx 0.5289$$\nThe scaling factor is the product of these two terms:\n$$S \\approx 0.5 \\times 0.5289 = 0.26445$$\nThus, the electrostatic attraction energy at high salt ($I_{\\mathrm{high}}$) is only about $26\\%$ of its value at physiological salt ($I_{\\mathrm{phys}}$). This represents a decrease of approximately $74\\%$.\n\nNow we apply this result to the two peptides.\nFor AMP-X ($z_X = +8$, purely electrostatic): Its total binding energy is $U_X(I) = U_{\\mathrm{elec},X}(I)$.\nWhen salt increases, its binding energy drops to $U_X(I_{\\mathrm{high}}) \\approx 0.26 \\, U_X(I_{\\mathrm{phys}})$. This is a very substantial loss of binding affinity, which, according to the problem, leads to a substantial loss of activity.\n\nFor AMP-Y ($z_Y = +3$, amphipathic): Its total binding energy is the sum of electrostatic and hydrophobic contributions: $U_Y(I) = U_{\\mathrm{elec},Y}(I) + U_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$.\nThe problem states that the hydrophobic contribution is salt-insensitive, with $U_{\\mathrm{hyd}} \\approx -6 \\, k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$.\nAt physiological salt, $U_Y(I_{\\mathrm{phys}}) = U_{\\mathrm{elec},Y}(I_{\\mathrm{phys}}) + U_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$.\nAt high salt, $U_Y(I_{\\mathrm{high}}) = U_{\\mathrm{elec},Y}(I_{\\mathrm{high}}) + U_{\\mathrm{hyd}} \\approx 0.26 \\, U_{\\mathrm{elec},Y}(I_{\\mathrm{phys}}) + U_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$.\nThe hydrophobic term $U_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$ is a large, favorable, and constant contribution to binding. It acts as an \"anchor\" that is not affected by salt. While the electrostatic part of its binding is reduced by the same fraction as for AMP-X, this only affects one component of its total binding energy. The presence of the significant, salt-insensitive hydrophobic energy $U_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$ means that AMP-Y will retain a much larger fraction of its total binding affinity compared to AMP-X. Therefore, AMP-Y is predicted to retain substantial activity at high salt.\n\nWe will now evaluate each statement.\n\nA. When $I$ increases from $0.15\\,\\mathrm{M}$ to $0.60\\,\\mathrm{M}$, the electrostatic attraction at $d=0.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ scales down by a factor of approximately $0.26$ independent of $z$; therefore AMP-X (purely electrostatic, $z=+8$) loses most activity, whereas AMP-Y ($z=+3$ plus $U_{\\mathrm{hyd}}\\approx -6\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$) retains substantial activity.\nThis statement is consistent with our calculation, which yielded a scaling factor of $\\approx 0.26$. Our derivation also showed this factor is independent of $z$. The conclusion about the differential activity loss of AMP-X and AMP-Y is also correct based on our physical analysis. AMP-X's purely electrostatic binding is severely weakened, while AMP-Y's binding is buffered by its salt-insensitive hydrophobic component. **Correct**.\n\nB. Increasing $I$ increases $\\kappa^{-1}$, so screening decreases and both AMPs should become more active at $0.60\\,\\mathrm{M}$ than at $0.15\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\nThis statement contains a fundamental error. According to the formula $\\kappa^{-1} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{I}$, increasing the ionic strength $I$ *decreases*, not increases, the Debye length $\\kappa^{-1}$. A smaller Debye length signifies *stronger* electrostatic screening, which weakens electrostatic interactions. Consequently, activity based on electrostatic attraction should decrease, not increase. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Hydrophobic insertion energies are screened by salt similarly to electrostatic attraction; therefore AMP-Y will lose at least as much activity as AMP-X when $I$ rises to $0.60\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\nThis statement directly contradicts a premise given in the problem: \"...hydrophobic insertion free energy $U_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$\" is \"salt-insensitive\". The conclusion is based on this false premise and is therefore invalid in the context of the problem. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. The fractional drop in electrostatic attraction is larger for higher valence ligands; therefore AMP-X will lose a larger fraction of its electrostatic component than AMP-Y when $I$ increases, even if both approach at the same $d$.\nOur derivation of the scaling factor $S$ explicitly showed that it is independent of the peptide valence $z$. The fractional drop is $1-S$, which is therefore also independent of $z$. While the absolute magnitude of the energy loss, $|\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{elec}}| = |(S-1)U_{\\mathrm{elec}}(I_{\\mathrm{phys}})|$, is indeed proportional to $z$ and thus larger for AMP-X, the statement incorrectly refers to the *fractional* drop. **Incorrect**.\n\nE. Acute phase responses raise plasma protein concentrations sufficiently to increase $I$ from $0.15\\,\\mathrm{M}$ to approximately $0.60\\,\\mathrm{M}$; hence both AMPs will be equivalently inactivated in inflamed serum, irrespective of hydrophobicity.\nThis statement makes two flawed assertions. First, the physiological claim about a four-fold increase in ionic strength during an acute phase response is highly dubious. Second, and more importantly within the problem's physical model, the conclusion that both AMPs are \"equivalently inactivated ... irrespective of hydrophobicity\" is false. Our analysis has shown that the salt-insensitive hydrophobic component of AMP-Y is precisely the reason it is *not* inactivated to the same degree as the purely electrostatic AMP-X. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2835935"}, {"introduction": "Once an antimicrobial protein binds to a bacterium, it can employ one of several killing mechanisms.

The depolarization assay uses the potential-sensitive dye $\\text{DiSC}_3(5)$ to monitor inner membrane potential changes as increased fluorescence. The susceptibility test measures survival by colony-forming units (CFU). Bacteria include a Gram-positive species with a thick, exposed peptidoglycan (PG) layer and a Gram-negative species in which peptidoglycan is shielded by an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS). For each species, both intact cells and cell-wall-deficient spheroplasts are tested. Spheroplasts lack most or all of the cell wall (peptidoglycan) but retain the cytoplasmic membrane.\n\nStarting only from the following foundational facts and definitions:\n- Antimicrobial peptides in barrier defenses can kill by directly disrupting phospholipid bilayers, producing membrane permeability and depolarization.\n- Defensins are cationic, amphipathic peptides that can insert into and permeabilize cytoplasmic membranes independently of cell wall binding.\n- REG$3$A is a bactericidal C-type lectin that binds peptidoglycan with high affinity; access to peptidoglycan is high in Gram-positive bacteria and low in intact Gram-negative bacteria because of the outer membrane.\n- Removal of the cell wall in “spheroplasts” eliminates peptidoglycan binding sites while leaving the cytoplasmic membrane accessible.\n- In a membrane depolarization assay with $\\text{DiSC}_3(5)$, loss of membrane potential yields increased fluorescence; killing linked to membrane permeabilization typically coincides with depolarization.\n\nWhich of the following patterns best distinguishes HNP-$1$ from REG$3$A in terms of their mechanistic behavior across the two assays?\n\nA.

The activity is measured by membrane depolarization (fluorescence) and killing (CFU loss).\n\n**Analysis of HNP-$1$ Behavior:**\nAccording to the provided fact $2$, HNP-$1$ is a defensin that permeabilizes cytoplasmic membranes directly and *independently of the cell wall*. Its mechanism of action relies on the presence of a phospholipid bilayer, which constitutes the cytoplasmic membrane.\n- **Intact Gram-positive bacteria:** These have a cytoplasmic membrane beneath a porous peptidoglycan (PG) wall. HNP-$1$ can penetrate the PG layer to reach and disrupt the membrane. **Expected result:** Membrane depolarization and CFU loss.\n- **Gram-positive spheroplasts:** These lack the PG wall, leaving the cytoplasmic membrane directly exposed. This is an ideal target for HNP-$1$. **Expected result:** Strong membrane depolarization and CFU loss.\n- **Intact Gram-negative bacteria:** These have a cytoplasmic (inner) membrane, but it is shielded by a PG layer and an outer membrane. Cationic peptides like HNP-$1$ are known to interact with the negatively charged LPS on the outer membrane, facilitating their own uptake to reach the inner membrane. **Expected result:** Membrane depolarization and CFU loss.\n- **Gram-negative spheroplasts:** These lack the outer membrane and PG, leaving the cytoplasmic membrane exposed. This is another ideal target for HNP-$1$. **Expected result:** Strong membrane depolarization and CFU loss.\n\nIn summary, HNP-$1$, targeting the universally present cytoplasmic membrane, is predicted to be active against all four bacterial preparations.\n\n**Analysis of REG$3$A Behavior:**\nAccording to the provided fact $3$, REG$3$A is a bactericidal lectin whose activity depends on high-affinity binding to peptidoglycan (PG).\n- **Intact Gram-positive bacteria:** The PG layer is thick and exposed, providing ample binding sites for REG$3$A. **Expected result:** Binding occurs, leading to its bactericidal effect, which is assumed to involve membrane damage, causing depolarization and CFU loss.\n- **Gram-positive spheroplasts:** These \"lack ... peptidoglycan binding sites\" (fact $4$). Without its target, REG$3$A cannot act. **Expected result:** No binding, negligible depolarization, and no CFU loss.\n- **Intact Gram-negative bacteria:** The PG layer is thin and located in the periplasmic space, shielded by the outer membrane. Access is low (fact $3$). **Expected result:** Minimal to no binding, negligible depolarization, and no significant CFU loss.\n- **Gram-negative spheroplasts:** As with Gram-positive spheroplasts, these lack the PG target. **Expected result:** No binding, negligible depolarization, and no CFU loss.\n\nIn summary, REG$3$A, being specific for PG, is predicted to be active *only* against intact Gram-positive bacteria.\n\n**Conclusion:** The distinguishing pattern is that HNP-$1$ is broadly active against all forms, while REG$3$A is narrowly active against only intact Gram-positive cells.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. HNP-$1$ produces a rapid increase in $\\text{DiSC}_3(5)$ fluorescence and CFU loss in both intact and spheroplasted Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. REG$3$A produces strong depolarization and CFU loss only in intact Gram-positive bacteria, with negligible depolarization and no killing of Gram-positive spheroplasts or any Gram-negative condition.**\n- This statement's prediction for HNP-$1$ (activity across all four conditions) and for REG$3$A (activity only against intact Gram-positive bacteria) precisely matches the derived analysis.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. REG$3$A exhibits greater depolarization and killing of Gram-positive spheroplasts than intact Gram-positive cells because removal of the cell wall improves access to the membrane; HNP-$1$ requires the cell wall to concentrate on the surface and therefore shows attenuated depolarization and killing of spheroplasts.**\n- This is incorrect. REG$3$A targets peptidoglycan, which is absent in spheroplasts; therefore, it should be inactive, not more active. The claim that HNP-$1$ requires the cell wall contradicts fact $2$, which states its action is independent of cell wall binding.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Both HNP-$1$ and REG$3$A require LPS to engage and depolarize membranes; therefore both show strong depolarization and killing of intact Gram-negative bacteria but little to no effect on Gram-negative spheroplasts or any Gram-positive condition.**\n- This is incorrect. REG$3$A targets PG, not LPS, and is active against Gram-positive bacteria which lack LPS. HNP-$1$ does not strictly require LPS, as it is active against Gram-positive bacteria as well. The conclusion is also flawed based on this false premise.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Both peptides are blocked by intact cell walls and thus show depolarization and killing only in spheroplasts for both species, with minimal effects on intact cells regardless of Gram status; this indicates that cell wall removal is the primary determinant of their activity.**\n- This is incorrect. The cell wall is the *target* for REG$3$A, not a barrier, so it should be active against intact Gram-positive cells and inactive against spheroplasts.

Multiplying the equation by $I(t)$ gives:\n$$\n\\exp(k_d t) \\frac{dC}{dt} + k_d \\exp(k_d t) C(t) = k_s \\exp(k_d t)\n$$\nThe left side is the derivative of a product:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( C(t) \\exp(k_d t) \\right) = k_s \\exp(k_d t)\n$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$:\n$$\nC(t) \\exp(k_d t) = \\int k_s \\exp(k_d t) dt = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} \\exp(k_d t) + A\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the constant of integration. Solving for $C(t)$:\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} + A \\exp(-k_d t)\n$$\nWe apply the initial condition $C(0) = 0$:\n$$\nC(0) = 0 = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} + A \\exp(0) \\implies A = -\\frac{k_s}{k_d}\n$$\nSubstituting $A$ back into the solution, we obtain the expression for CRP concentration during the synthesis phase, which we denote $C_1(t)$:\n$$\nC_1(t) = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (1 - \\exp(-k_d t)) \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\leq t \\leq \\tau\n$$\n\n**Phase 2: Clearance Only ($t > \\tau$)**\nFor the time interval after synthesis has ceased, the differential equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = -k_d C(t)\n$$\nThis is a separable equation, and its solution is a standard exponential decay:\n$$\nC(t) = B \\exp(-k_d t)\n$$\nwhere $B$ is a constant. We determine $B$ by enforcing the condition of continuity of concentration at time $t = \\tau$. The concentration at the end of Phase 1 must equal the concentration at the start of Phase 2. Let $C_2(t)$ be the concentration in this phase.\n$$\nC_2(\\tau) = C_1(\\tau)\n$$\nFirst, we calculate $C_1(\\tau)$:\n$$\nC_1(\\tau) = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (1 - \\exp(-k_d \\tau))\n$$\nNow we set $C_2(\\tau)$ equal to this value:\n$$\nB \\exp(-k_d \\tau) = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (1 - \\exp(-k_d \\tau))\n$$\nSolving for $B$:\n$$\nB = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (1 - \\exp(-k_d \\tau)) \\exp(k_d \\tau) = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (\\exp(k_d \\tau) - 1)\n$$\nThus, the solution for $t > \\tau$ is:\n$$\nC_2(t) = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (\\exp(k_d \\tau) - 1) \\exp(-k_d t) \\quad \\text{for } t > \\tau\n$$\n\n**Finding the Peak Concentration and Time-to-Peak**\nTo find the maximum concentration, we analyze the derivative of $C(t)$ in each interval.\n- For $0 \\leq t \\leq \\tau$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_1}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (1 - \\exp(-k_d t)) \\right) = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (k_d \\exp(-k_d t)) = k_s \\exp(-k_d t)\n$$\nSince $k_s > 0$ and $\\exp(-k_d t) > 0$ for all $t$, we have $\\frac{dC_1}{dt} > 0$. This demonstrates that the concentration $C(t)$ is strictly increasing throughout the interval $[0, \\tau]$.\n\n- For $t > \\tau$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_2}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (\\exp(k_d \\tau) - 1) \\exp(-k_d t) \\right) = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (\\exp(k_d \\tau) - 1) (-k_d \\exp(-k_d t))\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dC_2}{dt} = -k_s (\\exp(k_d \\tau) - 1) \\exp(-k_d t)\n$$\nGiven the constraints $\\tau \\geq 0$ and $k_d > 0$, the term $\\exp(k_d \\tau)$ is always greater than or equal to $1$. If $\\tau > 0$, then $\\exp(k_d \\tau) - 1 > 0$. Since $k_s > 0$ and the exponential term is positive, $\\frac{dC_2}{dt} < 0$. This indicates that the concentration $C(t)$ is strictly decreasing for all $t > \\tau$. If $\\tau = 0$, the entire process is trivial, $C(t)=0$ for all $t$.\n\nThe function $C(t)$ increases until $t=\\tau$ and then decreases for $t>\\tau$. The maximum value must therefore occur at the point where the behavior changes, which is $t = \\tau$.\nThe time at which the peak concentration occurs is:\n$$\nt_{peak} = \\tau\n$$\nThe peak concentration, $C_{peak}$, is the value of the concentration at this time, $C(\\tau)$. We use the expression for $C_1(t)$ to find this value:\n$$\nC_{peak} = C_1(\\tau) = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (1 - \\exp(-k_d \\tau))\n$$\nThese results are the exact analytic expressions required.\n\nFinal Expressions:\n- Peak Concentration: $C_{peak} = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (1 - \\exp(-k_d \\tau))$\n- Time-to-Peak: $t_{peak} = \\tau$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{k_s}{k_d} (1 - \\exp(-k_d \\tau)) & \\tau \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2835936"}]}
