It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous derivation and calculation. It describes a standard scenario in receptor-ligand biochemistry, based on fundamental principles of chemical equilibrium.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for fractional receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, based on the law of mass action for a simple bimolecular interaction.\n\nThe binding reaction at equilibrium is given as:\n$$[\\mathrm{R}] + [\\mathrm{L}] \\rightleftharpoons [\\mathrm{RL}]$$\nwhere $[\\mathrm{R}]$ is the concentration of the unoccupied receptor (TLR4–MD-2 complex), $[\\mathrm{L}]$ is the concentration of the free ligand (LPS), and $[\\mathrm{RL}]$ is the concentration of the ligand-receptor complex.\n\nBy the law of mass action, the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_{d}$, is defined as the ratio of the product of the concentrations of the reactants to the concentration of the product at equilibrium:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{R}][\\mathrm{L}]}{[\\mathrm{RL}]}$$\nTo proceed, two assumptions are necessary, as requested by the problem statement:\n1.  **Conservation of Receptor:** The total concentration of the receptor, denoted as $[\\mathrm{R}]_{T}$, is constant. This is a fundamental assumption for a closed system at equilibrium.\n2.  **Binding Stoichiometry:** The problem states there is a single, non-cooperative binding site. This implies a $1:1$ stoichiometry.

Mathematically, this is:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[\\mathrm{RL}]}{[\\mathrm{R}]_{T}}$$\nOur goal is to express $\\theta$ in terms of $[\\mathrm{L}]$ and $K_{d}$. To do this, we must eliminate $[\\mathrm{R}]$, $[\\mathrm{RL}]$, and $[\\mathrm{R}]_{T}$ from the expression for $\\theta$ using the other equations.\n\nFrom the receptor conservation equation, we can express the concentration of free receptor as:\n$$[\\mathrm{R}] = [\\mathrm{R}]_{T} - [\\mathrm{RL}]$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[\\mathrm{R}]$ into the definition of $K_{d}$:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{([\\mathrm{R}]_{T} - [\\mathrm{RL}])[\\mathrm{L}]}{[\\mathrm{RL}]}$$\nNow, we must rearrange this equation to solve for the term $[\\mathrm{RL}]$ or, more directly, the ratio $\\frac{[\\mathrm{RL}]}{[\\mathrm{R}]_{T}}$.\n$$K_{d} [\\mathrm{RL}] = ([\\mathrm{R}]_{T} - [\\mathrm{RL}])[\\mathrm{L}]$$\n$$K_{d} [\\mathrm{RL}] = [\\mathrm{R}]_{T}[\\mathrm{L}] - [\\mathrm{RL}][\\mathrm{L}]$$\nCollect the terms containing $[\\mathrm{RL}]$ on one side of the equation:\n$$K_{d} [\\mathrm{RL}] + [\\mathrm{RL}][\\mathrm{L}] = [\\mathrm{R}]_{T}[\\mathrm{L}]$$\nFactor out $[\\mathrm{RL}]$:\n$$[\\mathrm{RL}] (K_{d} + [\\mathrm{L}]) = [\\mathrm{R}]_{T}[\\mathrm{L}]$$\nTo obtain the fractional occupancy, we divide both sides by $[\\mathrm{R}]_{T}$ and by $(K_{d} + [\\mathrm{L}])$:\n$$\\frac{[\\mathrm{RL}]}{[\\mathrm{R}]_{T}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{L}]}{K_{d} + [\\mathrm{L}]}$$\nTherefore, the expression for fractional occupancy $\\theta$ is:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[\\mathrm{L}]}{K_{d} + [\\mathrm{L}]}$$\nThis is the required expression, which is a form of the Langmuir isotherm or Hill-Langmuir equation with a Hill coefficient of $1$.\n\nNext, we must compute the numerical value of $\\theta$ using the provided data:\nEquilibrium dissociation constant, $K_{d} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\nFree ligand concentration, $[\\mathrm{L}] = 30\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.

A rigorous scientific claim requires a multi-faceted strategy combining genetic tools, biochemical manipulations, and pathway analysis to systematically eliminate confounding variables. This practice [@problem_id:2900824] challenges you to design a \"gold-standard\" experiment to validate a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), a critical skill that hones your ability to build a robust and convincing scientific argument.", "problem": "A laboratory isolates two candidate damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs): a protein preparation enriched for High Mobility Group Box protein 1 (HMGB1) from necrotic cell supernatants, and a lipid fraction enriched for oxidized phospholipids (oxPL) from stressed cell membranes. When added to primary murine macrophages, both preparations induce tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-$\\alpha$) and interferon beta (IFN-$\\beta$) production. The investigators are concerned that trace lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or nucleic acid contamination could account for the activity. Starting from core definitions that pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and DAMPs, that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) requires the co-receptor myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD-2) for canonical LPS recognition, that endosomal TLRs require Unc93B1-dependent trafficking, and that biochemical susceptibility profiles differ for proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, select the single option that outlines the most rigorous experimental control suite and interpretive logic to conclude that the HMGB1 and oxPL activities are bona fide DAMP signals rather than artifacts of LPS or nucleic acid contamination. The approach must combine receptor genetics, pathway dependency, and orthogonal biochemical inactivation, and it must include internal controls that verify the effectiveness of each decontamination step.\n\nWhich option best meets these criteria?\n\nA. Implement a layered specificity and susceptibility strategy for each preparation. For HMGB1: (i) treat with polymyxin B to neutralize LPS and demonstrate HMGB1 activity is polymyxin B–insensitive; (ii) treat in parallel with benzonase (a DNase/RNase mix) to degrade contaminating nucleic acids and show activity is nuclease-insensitive; (iii) treat with proteinase K and heat denaturation to test protein dependence, predicting loss of activity if HMGB1 is the agonist; (iv) use macrophages from $TLR4^{-/-}$ and $MD-2^{-/-}$ mice versus wild-type controls to test receptor dependence; (v) use $Unc93B1^{-/-}$ cells and endosomal acidification blockade (e.g., chloroquine) to exclude endosomal TLRs; (vi) verify LPS depletion by passing the preparation over an EndoTrap resin and by a Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay that includes a spike-in LPS recovery control to rule out assay inhibition by lipids or proteins; (vii) validate with endotoxin-free, mammalian-expressed recombinant HMGB1 of defined redox state and demonstrate neutralization with an anti-HMGB1 antibody. For oxPL: (i) demonstrate polymyxin B–insensitivity and LAL negativity with spike-in recovery; (ii) show resistance to proteinase K and nucleases but loss of activity upon phospholipase A$_{2}$ treatment or mild base hydrolysis; (iii) confirm dependence on TLR4 and MD-2 but independence from Unc93B1; (iv) verify that phospholipase A$_{2}$ does not inactivate an LPS control, and that polymyxin B does not inactivate oxPL, to validate orthogonality. Conclude HMGB1 and oxPL are bona fide DAMPs if and only if activities follow the predicted susceptibility and receptor-dependency patterns.\nB. Rely primarily on biochemical purity and heat sensitivity: show both preparations are below the limit of detection by the LAL assay, then heat each at high temperature and demonstrate loss of activity, concluding that heat sensitivity rules out LPS contamination and supports DAMP activity. No genetic receptor controls are necessary if LAL is negative.\nC. Block TLR4 with a neutralizing antibody in wild-type macrophages and demonstrate loss of cytokine induction by both preparations. Add recombinant lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) to sequester any residual LPS. Conclude DAMP authenticity if TLR4 blockade reduces responses and LBP has minimal effect.\nD. Remove endotoxin using a commercial endotoxin removal column and demonstrate polymyxin B insensitivity of the residual activity in a human embryonic kidney reporter line expressing TLR4. Because reporter cells yield clean signals, additional enzymatic controls are unnecessary; endosomal TLRs are unlikely to be involved in reporter lines.\nE. Physically separate the lipid fraction by reverse-phase chromatography and confirm the presence of oxidized phospholipid species by mass spectrometry.

Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) like Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and DAMPs.\n    2.  Canonical LPS recognition by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) requires the co-receptor myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD-2).\n    3.  Endosomal TLRs require Unc93B1-dependent trafficking.\n    4.  Proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids have different biochemical susceptibilities.\n- **Task Requirement:** The selected strategy must be the \"most rigorous\" and must combine (a) receptor genetics, (b) pathway dependency, (c) orthogonal biochemical inactivation, and (d) internal controls to verify decontamination effectiveness.\n\n**Validation Analysis:**\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of innate immunology. HMGB1 and oxPL are known DAMPs that can signal through TLR4. The concern about LPS contamination is a classic, critical, and pervasive challenge in immunology research, especially when studying TLR4 agonists. The experimental tools mentioned (genetic knockouts, enzymatic digestion, specific inhibitors, LAL assay) are standard laboratory techniques. All premises are factually correct and scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for the \"most rigorous\" option, which establishes a clear optimization criterion for evaluating the choices. The goal—to distinguish bona fide DAMP activity from artifact—is unambiguous.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, scientific language. The criteria for rigor are explicitly defined, removing subjectivity from the evaluation.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem statement is scientifically valid, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to proceed with a logical solution. It is a non-trivial problem in experimental design.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Evaluation\n\nA rigorous proof to establish a novel ligand for a pattern recognition receptor must systematically address and exclude all plausible alternative explanations. The problem correctly identifies the main confounders as LPS and nucleic acids, both of which are extremely potent PAMPs. A comprehensive strategy must therefore integrate multiple lines of evidence.\n\n**Core Principles of a Rigorous Approach:**\n1.  **Biochemical Identity:** The activity must be linked to the chemical nature of the putative agonist. This is tested using specific enzymes. For a protein like HMGB1, the activity must be sensitive to proteases (e.g., proteinase K). For a lipid like oxPL, it must be sensitive to lipases (e.g., phospholipase A$_{2}$). Both should be insensitive to nucleases.\n2.  **Exclusion of LPS Contamination:** LPS is a potent TLR4 agonist. Its contribution must be ruled out through multiple, orthogonal methods:\n    - **Neutralization:** Using a specific binding agent like polymyxin B.\n    - **Quantification:** Using an ultrasensitive assay like the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay. Critically, this assay must include a spike-in control to ensure the sample matrix does not inhibit the assay and produce a false negative.\n    - **Genetic Evidence:** Canonical LPS signaling is strictly dependent on both TLR4 and its co-receptor MD-2. Activity that persists in cells lacking either of these proteins (`TLR4^{-/-}` or `MD-2^{-/-}`) is not due to canonical LPS action.\n3.  **Exclusion of Nucleic Acid Contamination:** Unmethylated CpG DNA and double- or single-stranded RNA are PAMPs recognized by endosomal TLRs (TLR9, TLR3, TLR7/8). Their contribution must be ruled out:\n    - **Enzymatic Digestion:** Using broad-spectrum nucleases (DNases and RNases, e.g., benzonase).\n    - **Genetic/Pharmacological Evidence:** Signaling from endosomal TLRs depends on the trafficking protein Unc93B1 and an acidic endosomal pH. Therefore, the activity should be independent of Unc93B1 (tested using `Unc93B1^{-/-}` cells) and resistant to endosomal acidification inhibitors (e.g., chloroquine).\n4.  **Receptor Identification:** The specific receptor(s) for the DAMP must be identified using genetic tools. Since HMGB1 and oxPL are reported TLR4 ligands, demonstrating loss of activity in `TLR4^{-/-}` and `MD-2^{-/-}` cells is essential.\n5.  **Ultimate Proof (Gold Standard):** The activity of the native preparation should be recapitulated by a highly pure, chemically defined, synthetic or recombinant version of the molecule. Furthermore, this activity should be blocked by a specific neutralizing antibody against the DAMP, not by an irrelevant isotype control antibody.\n6.  **Orthogonality of Controls:** It is crucial to show that the controls are specific. For example, polymyxin B should inactivate LPS but not the DAMP; proteinase K should degrade the protein DAMP but not affect LPS activity.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option against this framework of rigor.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThis option proposes a multi-faceted approach for both HMGB1 and oxPL that incorporates nearly every principle of rigor outlined above.\n- **For HMGB1:** It includes (i) polymyxin B for LPS, (ii) benzonase for nucleic acids, (iii) proteinase K/heat for protein identity, (iv) `TLR4^{-/-}`/`MD-2^{-/-}` cells for receptor genetics, (v) `Unc93B1^{-/-}`/chloroquine for endosomal pathway exclusion, (vi) a properly controlled LAL assay (with spike-in), and (vii) the gold-standard validation with endotoxin-free recombinant HMGB1 and a neutralizing antibody. The mention of HMGB1 redox state shows a particularly high level of sophistication.\n- **For oxPL:** It includes (i) rigorous LPS exclusion, (ii) biochemical characterization with lipases and resistance to proteases/nucleases, (iii) confirmation of the expected `TLR4`/`MD-2` dependence and `Unc93B1` independence.\n- **Orthogonality:** It explicitly includes a step (iv for oxPL) to validate the specificity of the control reagents (e.g., phospholipase does not inactivate LPS).\n\nThis option is exceptionally thorough and systematic. It leaves no stone unturned and directly addresses all requirements laid out in the problem.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThis strategy is critically flawed. It relies on two main points: LAL negativity and heat sensitivity. The logic that heat sensitivity rules out LPS is factually incorrect; LPS is famously heat-stable. Loss of activity upon heating only suggests the agonist is heat-labile (like a protein), it does not disprove the presence of a heat-stable contaminant like LPS. The dismissal of genetic controls based on a single, potentially flawed, biochemical assay (LAL without spike-in control) is the antithesis of a rigorous approach. It also completely ignores the possibility of nucleic acid contamination.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis approach is insufficient. While using a TLR4 blocking antibody is a valid step, it is less definitive than genetic knockout. The most significant flaw is the proposed use of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) to \"sequester\" LPS. LBP's physiological function is to facilitate LPS delivery to the receptor complex, thereby *enhancing* the response to low concentrations of LPS. Its use as a sequestering agent in this context is biochemically misguided. The method also lacks any controls for nucleic acid contamination or biochemical characterization of the DAMPs themselves.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThis option suffers from two major weaknesses. First, it relies on a HEK reporter cell line. While useful for screening, these are non-immune, artificial systems that may lack crucial co-receptors or signaling components present in primary macrophages, where the effect was originally observed. Conclusions from such a system are not definitive for a primary immune cell. Second, it explicitly and wrongly states that \"additional enzymatic controls are unnecessary\" and makes an untested assumption about the absence of endosomal TLR pathways. A rigorous approach never dismisses controls as unnecessary.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option E:**\nThis option proposes purification by chromatography and identification by mass spectrometry, which are excellent steps for chemical characterization. However, its conclusion is dangerously flawed. It suggests that if the purified fraction is active, one can infer that contamination is unlikely *without further controls*. This fails to account for the common problem of co-purification of potent contaminants. A trace amount of LPS co-migrating with the protein or lipid fraction could easily account for the activity. A rigorous approach demands that even the highly purified fraction be subjected to the same gauntlet of genetic, pathway, and inhibitor controls as the initial preparation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A is the only one that describes a comprehensive, multi-layered, and logically sound experimental plan that meets the highest standards of scientific rigor in the field of innate immunology. It correctly combines genetics, biochemistry, and pharmacology, including essential controls for the controls themselves, to build an unassailable case for DAMP activity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2900824"}, {"introduction": "Toll-like receptor 4 signaling is a highly dynamic process, distinguished by its temporal shift from an early, MyD88-dependent pathway at the cell surface to a later, TRIF-dependent pathway from endosomes.

This problem is scientifically grounded in immunology, well-posed, and provides all necessary information for its resolution. Therefore, it is deemed valid. We shall proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nFirst, we must derive the system of differential equations from the stated principles. The system involves four state variables: the concentration of surface-bound TLR4 complex, $S(t)$; the concentration of endosomal-bound TLR4 complex, $E(t)$; the activity of the MyD88 pathway, $M(t)$; and the activity of the TRIF pathway, $T(t)$.\n\nThe concentration of free surface receptors, $R_{\\mathrm{free}}(t)$, available for ligand binding is determined by the principle of receptor conservation. The total receptor concentration, $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is constant. Receptors can be free, surface-bound, or endosomal-bound. Thus, we have:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{free}}(t) = R_{\\mathrm{tot}} - S(t) - E(t) $$\n\nThe rate of change for the surface complex, $S(t)$, is governed by three processes:\n$1$. Formation, via binding of ligand $L$ to free receptors $R_{\\mathrm{free}}(t)$, described by mass-action kinetics: $k_{\\mathrm{on}} L R_{\\mathrm{free}}(t)$.\n$2$. Dissociation of the ligand from the surface complex: $k_{\\mathrm{off}} S(t)$.\n$3$. Internalization of the surface complex into the endosome: $k_{\\mathrm{end}} S(t)$.\n\nCombining these gives the first ODE:\n$$ \\frac{dS}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} L (R_{\\mathrm{tot}} - S(t) - E(t)) - (k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{end}}) S(t) $$\n\nThe concentration of the endosomal complex, $E(t)$, is governed by two processes:\n$1$. Influx from the surface via internalization: $k_{\\mathrm{end}} S(t)$.\n$2$. Loss from the endosome through an effective degradation process: $k_{\\mathrm{deg}} E(t)$.\n\nThis yields the second ODE:\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{end}} S(t) - k_{\\mathrm{deg}} E(t) $$\n\nThe activity of the MyD88 pathway, $M(t)$, is assumed to be activated by the surface complex $S(t)$ and undergoes first-order deactivation.\n$1$.

We will use a fine, uniform time grid for evaluation to ensure that features like signal peaks and time averages are computed accurately.\n\nFor each parameter set $(L, k_{\\mathrm{end}})$, we perform the simulation and then evaluate the switching criterion, which consists of three conditions that must all be met.\n\nLet the solution trajectories be numerically computed. We define the following quantities:\n- The difference signal: $D(t) = M(t) - T(t)$.\n- Peak signal amplitudes: $M_{\\max} = \\max_{t \\in [0,T]} M(t)$ and $T_{\\max} = \\max_{t \\in [0,T]} T(t)$.\n- Peak times: $t_{M,\\max} = \\arg\\max_{t \\in [0,T]} M(t)$ and $t_{T,\\max} = \\arg\\max_{t \\in [0,T]} T(t)$.\n- Time-averaged differences over early ($[0, t_e]$ where $t_e=60$) and late ($[t_\\ell, T]$ where $t_\\ell=180, T=240$) windows:\n  $$ \\overline{D}_{\\mathrm{early}} = \\frac{1}{t_e} \\int_{0}^{t_e} D(t) \\,dt $$\n  $$ \\overline{D}_{\\mathrm{late}} = \\frac{1}{T - t_\\ell} \\int_{t_\\ell}^{T} D(t) \\,dt $$\n- An amplitude threshold for significance: $A_{\\min} = 0.1$.\n- A dynamic difference threshold: $\\delta = 0.05 \\cdot \\max\\{M_{\\max}, T_{\\max}\\}$.\n\nThe switching criterion is defined as the logical conjunction of three conditions:\n$1$. Sufficient Amplitude: Both pathways must be substantially activated.\n   $$ M_{\\max} \\ge A_{\\min} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad T_{\\max} \\ge A_{\\min} $$\n$2$. Signal Dominance Switch: The MyD88 pathway must dominate early, and the TRIF pathway must dominate late.\n   $$ \\overline{D}_{\\mathrm{early}} > \\delta \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\overline{D}_{\\mathrm{late}} < -\\delta $$\n$3$. Temporal Precedence: The peak of the MyD88 pathway must occur before the peak of the TRIF pathway.\n   $$ t_{M,\\max} < t_{T,\\max} $$\n\nA Boolean value (True/False) is computed for each of the five test cases based on this criterion. The implementation will proceed by defining a function for the ODE system, iterating through the test cases, solving the ODEs for each, and applying the criterion to the numerical solution. The numerical integrals for the average differences will be computed using the trapezoidal rule on the fine evaluation grid. Case 5, with $L=0.0$, is a negative control; no stimulus should lead to no response, and thus the switching criterion will fail.\n\nThe final code will encapsulate this entire procedure and produce the required output format.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp, trapezoid\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the TLR4 signaling model for multiple parameter sets and\n    evaluates a temporal switching criterion.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Fixed Parameters ---\n    # Total receptor concentration\n    R_tot = 1.0\n    # Ligand on-rate constant (concentration^-1 min^-1)\n    k_on = 5.0\n    # Ligand off-rate constant (min^-1)\n    k_off = 1.0\n    # Effective loss rate of endosomal complex (min^-1)\n    k_deg = 0.1\n    # Activation rate constant for MyD88-pathway (min^-1)\n    k_M = 2.0\n    # Deactivation rate constant for MyD88-pathway (min^-1)\n    d_M = 0.5\n    # Activation rate constant for TRIF-pathway (min^-1)\n    k_T = 1.2\n    # Deactivation rate constant for TRIF-pathway (min^-1)\n    d_T = 0.3\n\n    # --- Numerical Experiment Setup ---\n    # Simulation time span (minutes)\n    t_span = (0, 240.0)\n    # Evaluation time points for high resolution\n    t_eval = np.linspace(t_span[0], t_span[1], 2401)\n    \n    # Switching Criterion Parameters\n    t_e = 60.0  # End of early window (minutes)\n    t_l = 180.0 # Start of late window (minutes)\n    T_sim = 240.0 # Total simulation time\n    A_min = 0.1 # Minimum amplitude threshold\n\n    # --- Test Suite ---\n    # Each case is a tuple (L, k_end)\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.0, 0.3),   # Case 1\n        (1.0, 0.01),  # Case 2\n        (1.0, 2.0),   # Case 3\n        (3.0, 0.4),   # Case 4\n        (0.0, 0.5),   # Case 5 (Negative control)\n    ]\n\n    def model(t, y, params):\n        \"\"\"\n        Defines the system of ODEs for TLR4 signaling.\n        y = [S, E, M, T]\n        \"\"\"\n        S, E, M, T = y\n        L, k_end = params['L'], params['k_end']\n        \n        # Free receptor concentration from conservation law\n        R_free = R_tot - S - E\n        \n        # dS/dt\n        dSdt = k_on * L * R_free - (k_off + k_end) * S\n        # dE/dt\n        dEdt = k_end * S - k_deg * E\n        # dM/dt\n        dMdt = k_M * S - d_M * M\n        # dT/dt\n        dTdt = k_T * E - d_T * T\n        \n        return [dSdt, dEdt, dMdt, dTdt]\n\n    results = []\n    # --- Main Loop ---\n    for L_case, k_end_case in test_cases:\n        \n        # Set parameters for the current case\n        params = {'L': L_case, 'k_end': k_end_case}\n        \n        # Initial conditions\n        y0 = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n        \n        # Solve the ODE system\n        sol = solve_ivp(\n            fun=model,\n            t_span=t_span,\n            y0=y0,\n            args=(params,),\n            dense_output=True,\n            t_eval=t_eval,\n            method='RK45'\n        )\n        \n        M_t = sol.y[2]\n        T_t = sol.y[3]\n        \n        # --- Evaluate Switching Criterion ---\n        \n        # 1.
