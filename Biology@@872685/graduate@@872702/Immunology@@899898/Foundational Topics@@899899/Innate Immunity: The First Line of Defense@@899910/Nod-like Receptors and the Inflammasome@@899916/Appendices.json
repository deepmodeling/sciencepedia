This exercise challenges you to think critically about this sequence and the indispensable role of the adaptor protein ASC, which acts as a central hub connecting upstream sensing to downstream enzymatic activation. By considering a hypothetical loss-of-function scenario, you can deduce the exact point at which this critical signaling cascade would be broken. [@problem_id:2255144]", "problem": "The inflammasome is a large intracellular multi-protein complex that plays a critical role in the innate immune system by activating inflammatory processes. Canonical inflammasome activation in a macrophage, which leads to the maturation of the potent pro-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-1β ($IL-1\\beta$), generally follows a specific sequence. First, a priming signal, such as a Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP), induces the synthesis of inactive precursor proteins, including $pro-IL-1\\beta$ and the sensor protein NLRP3. Second, an activation signal, such as a Damage-Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP), triggers the oligomerization of NLRP3. This sensor then recruits an adaptor protein, which in turn recruits pro-caspase-1, an inactive protease. This recruitment leads to the activation of caspase-1, which then cleaves $pro-IL-1\\beta$ into its mature, active form for secretion.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered macrophage cell line that possesses a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the adaptor protein known as Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC). These cells are exposed to appropriate priming and activation signals that would normally trigger robust NLRP3 inflammasome activity. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the direct outcome of the ASC mutation on $IL-1\\beta$ processing in these cells?\n\nA. The priming signal fails to induce transcription of the gene for $pro-IL-1\\beta$, so no precursor is available for processing.\n\nB. Pro-caspase-1 is not recruited to the inflammasome complex and therefore is not activated, preventing the cleavage of $pro-IL-1\\beta$.\n\nC. The NLRP3 sensor protein fails to oligomerize in response to the activation signal, halting the assembly of the inflammasome at the initial step.\n\nD. Mature, active $IL-1\\beta$ is correctly produced but accumulates in the cytoplasm because the ASC protein is also required for its secretion.", "solution": "Step 1: Establish the canonical sequence of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. The process requires two signals. The priming signal (e.g., a PAMP via Toll-like receptors and NF-κB activation) induces transcription and translation of precursor proteins, including $pro-IL-1\\beta$ and the NLRP3 sensor. The activation signal (e.g., a DAMP) causes NLRP3 to oligomerize and recruit an adaptor protein, ASC, which contains a PYD domain to bind NLRP3 and a CARD domain to recruit pro-caspase-1. Proximity-induced autocatalytic activation of caspase-1 follows, which cleaves $pro-IL-1\\beta$ to mature $IL-1\\beta$ and cleaves gasdermin D to enable secretion.\n\nStep 2: Define the role of ASC. ASC bridges NLRP3 and pro-caspase-1 through PYD-PYD (with NLRP3) and CARD-CARD (with pro-caspase-1) interactions, forming ASC “specks” that nucleate clustering of pro-caspase-1. This clustering is required for caspase-1 activation and subsequent proteolytic processing of $pro-IL-1\\beta$.\n\nStep 3: Predict the effect of ASC loss-of-function. \n- Priming remains intact because ASC is not required for NF-κB–dependent transcription of $pro-IL-1\\beta$ or NLRP3; thus $pro-IL-1\\beta$ and NLRP3 can still be synthesized.\n- NLRP3 can still sense activation signals and oligomerize; ASC is downstream of this step.\n- Without functional ASC, pro-caspase-1 cannot be efficiently recruited to the complex, preventing its activation.\n- Consequently, $pro-IL-1\\beta$ is not cleaved to mature $IL-1\\beta$, and gasdermin D is not cleaved, impairing secretion as well.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options.\n- A is incorrect: Priming and transcription of $pro-IL-1\\beta$ do not require ASC.\n- B is correct: Loss of ASC prevents recruitment and activation of pro-caspase-1, thereby preventing cleavage of $pro-IL-1\\beta$.\n- C is incorrect: NLRP3 oligomerization is upstream of ASC function and can occur without ASC.\n- D is incorrect: Mature $IL-1\\beta$ is not produced in the absence of caspase-1 activation; ASC is not a secretion factor per se, and secretion depends on gasdermin D pores generated by caspase-1 activity, which is absent here.\n\nTherefore, the direct outcome of the ASC mutation is failure to recruit and activate pro-caspase-1, preventing the cleavage of $pro-IL-1\\beta$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2255144"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the inflammasome requires moving beyond static diagrams to visualizing its dynamics within the complex architecture of a cell.

The method is the first-order propagation of uncertainty, also known as the delta method.\n\nFirst, we must express the concentration $C$ as a function of the absorbance $A$. The given model is:\n$$A = m \\log_{10}(C) + b$$\nRearranging to solve for $C$:\n$$A - b = m \\log_{10}(C)$$\n$$\\log_{10}(C) = \\frac{A - b}{m}$$\n$$C(A) = 10^{\\left(\\frac{A-b}{m}\\right)}$$\nFor the purpose of differentiation, it is more convenient to express this function using the natural exponential function, using the identity $10^x = \\exp(x \\ln(10))$:\n$$C(A) = \\exp\\left( \\frac{\\ln(10)}{m} (A - b) \\right)$$\n\nNext, we process the triplicate absorbance measurements $A_1 = 1.04$, $A_2 = 1.01$, and $A_3 = 1.07$.
