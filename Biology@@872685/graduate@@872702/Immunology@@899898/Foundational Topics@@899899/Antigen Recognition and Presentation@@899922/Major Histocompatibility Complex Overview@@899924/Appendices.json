For MHC class I, the two primary anchors are typically at peptide position $P2$ (engaging the so-called B pocket) and the C-terminal position $P\\Omega$ (engaging the F pocket). The binding contribution of a peptide can be reasoned from the compatibility of its side chains at $P2$ and $P\\Omega$ with the allele’s pocket chemistry, along with secondary contributions from other positions.

The description of MHC class $I$ peptide presentation, the role of primary anchor residues at positions $P2$ and $P\\Omega$, the concept of allele-specific binding pockets, and the known binding motif for HLA-B*07:02 (a preference for Proline at $P2$ and hydrophobic residues at the C-terminus) are all factually correct and central to the field.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

The question asks for a comparative assessment, which leads to a unique and meaningful conclusion based on the provided framework.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise, technical, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary information (the peptides, the allele, the binding preferences, and the core principle for evaluation) to arrive at a logical answer. There are no internal contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a standard application of established principles in immunology. A solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe problem requires a comparison of the binding likelihood of two $9$-mer peptides to the MHC class $I$ allele HLA-B*07:02. The fundamental basis for this comparison is the degree to which each peptide satisfies the primary anchor preferences of the allele at positions $P2$ and $P\\Omega$. For a $9$-mer peptide, the C-terminal position $P\\Omega$ is position $P9$.\n\nThe stated preferences for HLA-B*07:02 are:\n1.  Position $P2$: Proline ($P$).\n2.  Position $P\\Omega$ ($P9$): A hydrophobic residue.\n\nLet us analyze each peptide.\n\n**Peptide 1: “APRTVYQLL”**\n- The sequence is $A-P-R-T-V-Y-Q-L-L$.\n- **Position $P2$**: The residue is Proline ($P$). This **satisfies** the primary anchor preference for position $P2$.\n- **Position $P9$ ($P\\Omega$)**: The residue is Leucine ($L$). Leucine is an aliphatic amino acid with a nonpolar, hydrophobic side chain. This **satisfies** the primary anchor preference for a hydrophobic residue at the C-terminus.\n\nConclusion for Peptide 1: “APRTVYQLL” satisfies both of the specified primary anchor preferences for HLA-B*07:02. It is therefore predicted to be a strong binder.\n\n**Peptide 2: “AQPTVYQLL”**\n- The sequence is $A-Q-P-T-V-Y-Q-L-L$.\n- **Position $P2$**: The residue is Glutamine ($Q$). Glutamine has a polar, uncharged side chain. It is not Proline. This **fails to satisfy** the primary anchor preference for position $P2$.\n- **Position $P9$ ($P\\Omega$)**: The residue is Leucine ($L$). As established, Leucine is hydrophobic. This **satisfies** the primary anchor preference for the C-terminus.\n\nConclusion for Peptide 2: “AQPTVYQLL” satisfies only one of the two primary anchor preferences. It fails to meet the critical requirement at position $P2$.\n\n**Comparison**\nBased on the explicit rule that binding is driven by satisfying the primary anchor preferences at $P2$ and $P\\Omega$, \"APRTVYQLL\" is a far more likely binder than \"AQPTVYQLL\". The first peptide fulfills both primary requirements, while the second fulfills only one. The mismatch at $P2$ for the second peptide is a significant defect.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. “APRTVYQLL” is more likely to bind because it satisfies the $P2$-proline and C-terminal hydrophobic preferences, whereas “AQPTVYQLL” does not.**\nThis statement is a precise summary of the derivation above. \"APRTVYQLL\" has $P$ at $P2$ and $L$ (hydrophobic) at $P9$. \"AQPTVYQLL\" has $Q$ at $P2$ (not $P$) and $L$ at $P9$. The reasoning and conclusion are entirely correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. “AQPTVYQLL” is more likely to bind because a proline at $P3$ can substitute for the lack of proline at $P2$ in engaging the B pocket.**\nThis statement is immunologically unsound. The peptide backbone is held in a constrained conformation within the MHC binding groove. The B pocket is structurally positioned to accommodate the side chain of the residue at $P2$. The side chain of the residue at $P3$ projects from a different position on the peptide backbone and typically points away from the B pocket. It cannot physically occupy the B pocket as a substitute for the $P2$ residue. The problem statement itself defines the B pocket as engaging $P2$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Both peptides are equally likely to bind because they share the same C-terminal residue, and the C-terminal anchor dominates over $P2$.**\nThe problem identifies both $P2$ and $P\\Omega$ as *primary* anchors, implying they are both of high importance. It provides no information to suggest that one dominates the other. To assume a hierarchy of anchors is to introduce outside information not supported by the problem statement. Based on the given rules, a peptide satisfying two primary anchors is superior to one satisfying only one. Therefore, they are not equally likely to bind.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Neither peptide is likely to bind because “APRTVYQLL” contains a basic residue at $P3$, and “AQPTVYQLL” lacks a proline at $P2$, so both violate critical rules.**\nThis option contains two claims. The first claim is that \"APRTVYQLL\" violates a critical rule due to the basic residue Arginine ($R$) at $P3$. The problem does not state any prohibitive rules for secondary positions like $P3$. It only mentions \"secondary contributions,\" which can be positive, neutral, or negative, but are not described as \"critical.\" The peptide \"APRTVYQLL\" perfectly satisfies the two explicitly stated critical rules for the primary anchors. The second claim, that \"AQPTVYQLL\" lacks a proline at $P2$, is true, but this does not support the overall conclusion that *neither* is likely to bind. \"APRTVYQLL\" is a very strong candidate.

Assume the following well-established facts: (i) peptide binding stabilizes MHC I heavy chain–beta-2 microglobulin into the folded pMHC I, and the magnitude of stabilization increases with peptide affinity; (ii) higher apparent $T_m$ reflects greater thermodynamic stability of the folded complex; (iii) tapasin, within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) peptide-loading complex, catalyzes peptide exchange and edits the peptide repertoire toward higher-affinity ligands.

It uses established scientific terminology and relies on explicitly stated \"well-established facts\" as axioms for deduction, avoiding any subjective or ambiguous phrasing.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. Therefore, the problem is **valid**, and a solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe solution is derived by a logical synthesis of the three provided principles.\n\n1.  **Function of Tapasin (Principle iii)**: Tapasin is an editor. In wild-type (WT) cells, it ensures that the MHC class I molecules that eventually reach the cell surface are predominantly loaded with high-affinity peptides. It accomplishes this by stabilizing the peptide-receptive state of MHC I within the PLC and catalyzing the dissociation of low-affinity peptides, allowing higher-affinity peptides to bind and form a stable complex that can be exported from the ER.\n\n2.  **Consequence of Tapasin Loss**: In the tapasin-deficient cell line, this critical peptide editing function is absent. MHC class I molecules will load peptides in a less discriminating manner. Consequently, the repertoire of peptides that successfully load onto MHC I and are transported to the cell surface will be much broader and of significantly lower average affinity compared to the WT case. This pool will include many suboptimal peptides. Furthermore, a fraction of MHC I molecules may fail to acquire any stable peptide and either be retained/degraded in the ER or reach the cell surface in a highly unstable, \"partially empty\" or peptide-receptive conformation.\n\n3.  **Relating Peptide Affinity to Stability and $T_m$ (Principles i & ii)**: Principle (i) states that stability is proportional to peptide affinity. Principle (ii) states that $T_m$ is a direct measure of stability. Therefore, a higher peptide affinity results in a higher $T_m$.\n\n4.  **Prediction of the $T_m$ Distribution**:\n    -   Because the tapasin-deficient cells express a pMHC I pool with a lower average peptide affinity, the average thermal stability of this pool must be lower than that of the WT pool. This translates to a **left shift** in the overall $T_m$ distribution, meaning the mean or peak $T_m$ will be at a lower temperature.\n    -   The loss of the editing filter means that the range of peptide affinities represented on the cell surface will be much wider than in WT cells. In WT, selection favors a narrow range of high-affinities. In the knockout, affinities will range from very low to moderate. This increased heterogeneity in stability will cause a **broadening** of the $T_m$ distribution.\n    -   The presence of a significant population of very low-affinity or partially empty complexes, which are extremely unstable, will create a prominent feature at the low-temperature end of the distribution, described as an **increased low-$T_m$ shoulder** or sub-peak.\n    -   It is also an established fact (though provided as a hint within option A, its logic is sound) that certain MHC I alleles are \"tapasin-independent\" and can load high-affinity peptides with reasonable efficiency even without tapasin. Therefore, it is plausible that a **minor subpopulation** of highly stable pMHC I complexes persists, which would be observed as a small peak or tail at high $T_m$ values.\n\nIn summary, the loss of tapasin is expected to result in a pMHC I surface population that is, on average, less stable and more heterogeneous. This corresponds to a $T_m$ distribution that is shifted to lower temperatures, is broader, and possesses a significant low-$T_m$ component.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n-   **A. Relative to wild-type, tapasin-deficient cells show a left-shifted and broadened $T_m$ distribution with an increased low-$T_m$ shoulder, consistent with a larger fraction of suboptimally loaded or partially empty MHC I; a minor high-$T_m$ subpopulation may persist from alleles that are relatively tapasin-independent.**\n    This description perfectly matches the logical deductions made above. The left-shift reflects lower average stability. The broadening reflects increased heterogeneity. The low-$T_m$ shoulder reflects the presence of highly unstable, suboptimally loaded complexes. The persistence of a minor high-$T_m$ population is a known nuance for tapasin-independent alleles. This statement is entirely consistent with the provided principles.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **B. Relative to wild-type, tapasin-deficient cells show a right-shifted and narrowed $T_m$ distribution because the absence of tapasin reduces peptide exchange, locking in only the highest-affinity peptides.**\n    This is incorrect. A \"right-shift\" implies increased stability, which contradicts the known function of tapasin as a quality control factor that promotes stability. The reasoning that loss of exchange \"locks in\" high-affinity peptides is flawed; it is more likely to lock in the *first* peptides that bind, which are statistically more likely to be of low or moderate affinity. Loss of editing leads to decreased, not increased, stringency.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. The mean $T_m$ is unchanged, but the overall fluorescence amplitude decreases because tapasin loss affects dye accessibility rather than thermodynamic stability.**\n    This is incorrect. Principle (iii) states that tapasin edits the peptide repertoire. Principle (i) links the peptide to stability. Principle (ii) links stability to $T_m$. It is therefore a logical necessity that the mean $T_m$ *must* change. Claiming stability is unaffected is a direct contradiction of the problem's premises.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. The distribution becomes bimodal with both modes at higher $T_m$ values because peptide supply from the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) is unrestricted in the absence of tapasin, favoring more stable complexes.**\n    This is incorrect. The prediction of higher $T_m$ values (higher stability) is wrong for the reasons already stated. The reasoning is also factually flawed. Tapasin forms a bridge between MHC I and TAP, facilitating efficient peptide transfer. The loss of tapasin uncouples this interaction, which can *impair*, not unrestrict, the loading of peptides from TAP.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2866002"}]}
