Consider a single-cell context in which HLA-E binds a peptide ligand at a single site with rapid equilibrium governed by the law of mass action. Let the dissociation constant be defined as $K_{d} = \\frac{[H][L]}{[HL]}$, where $[H]$ is the concentration of unbound HLA-E, $[L]$ is the concentration of free peptide, and $[HL]$ is the concentration of the HLA-E–peptide complex. Assume that the total HLA-E concentration is $[H]_{\\mathrm{T}} = [H] + [HL]$, that peptide is in large excess so that $[L]$ can be approximated by the supplied value, and that inhibitory signaling strength is proportional to the density of HLA-E–peptide complexes on the surface. Under these assumptions, inhibitory signaling strength is proportional to the fractional occupancy $f = \\frac{[HL]}{[H]_{\\mathrm{T}}}$.\n\nYou are given three leader peptide variants with measured dissociation constants to HLA-E: $K_{d,1} = 50$ nM, $K_{d,2} = 200$ nM, and $K_{d,3} = 1000$ nM.

Do not round unless necessary; exact forms are acceptable.", "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of a single-site biomolecular binding equilibrium, which is a fundamental concept. We must first validate the problem's premises. The problem describes a standard immunological interaction (HLA-E with leader peptides) using the law of mass action, a cornerstone of chemical kinetics and thermodynamics. The data provided are physically plausible. The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains no ambiguities or contradictions. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is threefold: first, to derive an expression for the fractional occupancy, $f$; second, to compute its value for three peptide variants; and third, to determine the fold-difference in inhibitory signaling between the most and least potent variants.\n\nWe begin with the provided definitions. The dissociation constant, $K_d$, is given by:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[H][L]}{[HL]}$$\nwhere $[H]$ is the concentration of unbound HLA-E, $[L]$ is the concentration of free peptide ligand, and $[HL]$ is the concentration of the HLA-E-peptide complex.\n\nThe total concentration of HLA-E, $[H]_{\\mathrm{T}}$, is conserved, such that:\n$$[H]_{\\mathrm{T}} = [H] + [HL]$$\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $f$, is defined as the fraction of total HLA-E that is bound to the peptide:\n$$f = \\frac{[HL]}{[H]_{\\mathrm{T}}}$$\n\nOur first goal is to derive an expression for $f$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_d$. We can rearrange the mass conservation equation to express the concentration of unbound HLA-E, $[H]$, as:\n$$[H] = [H]_{\\mathrm{T}} - [HL]$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $[H]$ into the equation for $K_d$:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{([H]_{\\mathrm{T}} - [HL])[L]}{[HL]}$$\n\nWe now solve this equation for the ratio $\\frac{[HL]}{[H]_{\\mathrm{T}}}$, which is $f$.\nMultiplying both sides by $[HL]$ gives:\n$$K_{d} [HL] = ([H]_{\\mathrm{T}} - [HL])[L]$$\n$$K_{d} [HL] = [H]_{\\mathrm{T}}[L] - [HL][L]$$\n\nTo isolate terms containing $[HL]$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$K_{d} [HL] + [HL][L] = [H]_{\\mathrm{T}}[L]$$\n$$[HL](K_{d} + [L]) = [H]_{\\mathrm{T}}[L]$$\n\nFinally, to obtain the fractional occupancy $f = \\frac{[HL]}{[H]_{\\mathrm{T}}}$, we divide both sides by $[H]_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and by $(K_{d} + [L])$:\n$$f = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d} + [L]}$$\nThis is the required expression for fractional occupancy, also known as the Langmuir binding isotherm for a single-site interaction.\n\nThe second task is to compute $f$ for the three peptide variants. The problem specifies a peptide concentration of $[L] = 500$ nM and provides the following dissociation constants:\n$K_{d,1} = 50$ nM\n$K_{d,2} = 200$ nM\n$K_{d,3} = 1000$ nM\n\nWe calculate the fractional occupancy for each variant:\nFor variant 1:\n$$f_1 = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,1} + [L]} = \\frac{500}{50 + 500} = \\frac{500}{550} = \\frac{10}{11}$$\nFor variant 2:\n$$f_2 = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,2} + [L]} = \\frac{500}{200 + 500} = \\frac{500}{700} = \\frac{5}{7}$$\nFor variant 3:\n$$f_3 = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d,3} + [L]} = \\frac{500}{1000 + 500} = \\frac{500}{1500} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nThe third task is to find the fold-difference in NK inhibitory signaling between the strongest and weakest variants. The problem states that inhibitory signaling strength, which we denote $S$, is proportional to the fractional occupancy, $f$. That is, $S = c \\cdot f$, where $c$ is a constant of proportionality. Since HLA-E expression is identical, $c$ is the same for all variants.\n\nStronger signaling corresponds to a higher value of $f$. We must compare the computed values of $f$:\n$f_1 = \\frac{10}{11} \\approx 0.909$\n$f_2 = \\frac{5}{7} \\approx 0.714$\n$f_3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333$\n\nClearly, $f_1 > f_2 > f_3$. Therefore, variant 1 induces the strongest inhibition ($S_{strongest} = c \\cdot f_1$) and variant 3 induces the weakest inhibition ($S_{weakest} = c \\cdot f_3$). A lower $K_d$ signifies higher binding affinity, resulting in greater fractional occupancy and thus stronger signaling at a given ligand concentration.\n\nThe fold-difference is the ratio of the strongest signaling to the weakest signaling:\n$$\\text{Fold-difference} = \\frac{S_{strongest}}{S_{weakest}} = \\frac{c \\cdot f_1}{c \\cdot f_3} = \\frac{f_1}{f_3}$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\\text{Fold-difference} = \\frac{\\frac{10}{11}}{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{10}{11} \\times 3 = \\frac{30}{11}$$\n\nThis dimensionless number is the final answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{30}{11}}$$", "id": "2877534"}, {"introduction": "Unlike classical MHC molecules that present peptides, the CD1 family specializes in presenting a diverse array of lipid and glycolipid antigens to T cells.

This gives $8$ state variables: $C_u^{\\mathrm{ER}}, C_b^{\\mathrm{ER}}, C_u^{\\mathrm{G}}, C_b^{\\mathrm{G}}, C_u^{\\mathrm{EE}}, C_b^{\\mathrm{EE}}, C_u^{\\mathrm{Ly}}, C_b^{\\mathrm{Ly}}$.\n- **Trafficking Routes and Rates**:\n    - ER to Golgi: rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{eg}}$ ($\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$).\n    - Golgi to EE: rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{ge}}$ ($\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$).\n    - EE to Ly: rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{el}}$ ($\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$).\n    - Ly to EE: rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{le}}$ ($\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$).\n- **Binding Reactions**:\n    - Occur only in EE and Ly.\n    - EE parameters: on-rate $k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{\\mathrm{EE}}$ ($\\mathrm{(conc \\cdot s)^{-1}}$), off-rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{\\mathrm{EE}}$ ($\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$), antigen abundance $a_{\\mathrm{EE}}$ (dimensionless).\n    - Ly parameters: on-rate $k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{\\mathrm{Ly}}$ ($\\mathrm{(conc \\cdot s)^{-1}}$), off-rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{\\mathrm{Ly}}$ ($\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$), antigen abundance $a_{\\mathrm{Ly}}$ (dimensionless).\n    - Binding in ER and Golgi is zero.\n- **Initial Conditions**: At $t = 0 \\ \\mathrm{s}$, $C_u^{\\mathrm{ER}}(0) = T$, and all other $7$ species concentrations are zero.\n- **Conservation Law**: Total CD1 is conserved: $T = \\sum_{i \\in \\{\\mathrm{ER,G,EE,Ly}\\}} (C_u^i + C_b^i)$.\n- **Constants**: Total CD1 amount $T = 1.0$, simulation end time $t_{\\mathrm{end}} = 200000 \\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n- **Task**: Compute the final bound fraction $F_{\\mathrm{bound}}(t_{\\mathrm{end}}) = (\\sum_{i} C_b^i(t_{\\mathrm{end}})) / T$.\n- **Test Suite**: Four parameter sets (A, B, C, D) are provided with specific numerical values.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on fundamental principles of chemical kinetics and cell biology: mass balance for compartmental models, first-order kinetics for transport processes, and mass-action law for bimolecular reactions. These are standard and rigorously established frameworks for modeling such systems. The biological context, CD1 antigen presentation, is a well-studied area of immunology. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is formulated as an initial value problem for a system of coupled, first-order ODEs. The right-hand side of the ODE system is a set of polynomials in the state variables, which are Lipschitz continuous on any bounded domain. By the Picard-Lindelöf theorem, a unique solution exists for a given set of initial conditions. The recommendation to use a stiff solver is appropriate for systems with potentially disparate timescales (e.g., fast binding vs. slow trafficking), indicating a well-considered problem structure.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms using mathematical and scientific language. It is free from ambiguity, subjectivity, and non-scientific claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: All necessary rate constants, initial conditions, and parameters are defined to construct and solve the mathematical model. The conservation principle is explicitly stated and can be verified to be consistent with the derived ODEs. The problem is self-contained and internally consistent.\n\n### Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined, scientifically grounded task in computational systems biology. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Design: Derivation of the ODE System\n\nThe model is derived from the principle of mass balance, which states that for any species $X$ in a compartment, its rate of change is the sum of all influxes minus the sum of all effluxes. Let $y_0, ..., y_7$ represent the concentrations of the $8$ species:\n$y = [C_u^{\\mathrm{ER}}, C_b^{\\mathrm{ER}}, C_u^{\\mathrm{G}}, C_b^{\\mathrm{G}}, C_u^{\\mathrm{EE}}, C_b^{\\mathrm{EE}}, C_u^{\\mathrm{Ly}}, C_b^{\\mathrm{Ly}}]$.\n\n1.  **ER Compartment**: Unbound ($C_u^{\\mathrm{ER}}$) and bound ($C_b^{\\mathrm{ER}}$) CD1 traffic to the Golgi. No binding occurs.\n    $$ \\frac{dC_u^{\\mathrm{ER}}}{dt} = -k_{\\mathrm{eg}} C_u^{\\mathrm{ER}} $$\n    $$ \\frac{dC_b^{\\mathrm{ER}}}{dt} = -k_{\\mathrm{eg}} C_b^{\\mathrm{ER}} $$\n\n2.  **Golgi Compartment**: Species arrive from the ER and exit to the EE. No binding occurs.\n    $$ \\frac{dC_u^{\\mathrm{G}}}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{eg}} C_u^{\\mathrm{ER}} - k_{\\mathrm{ge}} C_u^{\\mathrm{G}} $$\n    $$ \\frac{dC_b^{\\mathrm{G}}}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{eg}} C_b^{\\mathrm{ER}} - k_{\\mathrm{ge}} C_b^{\\mathrm{G}} $$\n\n3.  **Early Endosome Compartment**: Species arrive from the Golgi and the Lysosome, and exit to the Lysosome. Binding and unbinding reactions occur here.\n    $$ \\frac{dC_u^{\\mathrm{EE}}}{dt} = \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{ge}} C_u^{\\mathrm{G}}}_{\\text{In from G}} + \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{le}} C_u^{\\mathrm{Ly}}}_{\\text{In from Ly}} - \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{el}} C_u^{\\mathrm{EE}}}_{\\text{Out to Ly}} - \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{\\mathrm{EE}} a_{\\mathrm{EE}} C_u^{\\mathrm{EE}}}_{\\text{Binding}} + \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{\\mathrm{EE}} C_b^{\\mathrm{EE}}}_{\\text{Unbinding}} $$\n    $$ \\frac{dC_b^{\\mathrm{EE}}}{dt} = \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{ge}} C_b^{\\mathrm{G}}}_{\\text{In from G}} + \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{le}} C_b^{\\mathrm{Ly}}}_{\\text{In from Ly}} - \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{el}} C_b^{\\mathrm{EE}}}_{\\text{Out to Ly}} + \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{\\mathrm{EE}} a_{\\mathrm{EE}} C_u^{\\mathrm{EE}}}_{\\text{Binding}} - \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{\\mathrm{EE}} C_b^{\\mathrm{EE}}}_{\\text{Unbinding}} $$\n\n4.  **Lysosome Compartment**: Species arrive from the EE and recycle back to the EE. Binding and unbinding reactions also occur.\n    $$ \\frac{dC_u^{\\mathrm{Ly}}}{dt} = \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{el}} C_u^{\\mathrm{EE}}}_{\\text{In from EE}} - \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{le}} C_u^{\\mathrm{Ly}}}_{\\text{Out to EE}} - \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{\\mathrm{Ly}} a_{\\mathrm{Ly}} C_u^{\\mathrm{Ly}}}_{\\text{Binding}} + \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{\\mathrm{Ly}} C_b^{\\mathrm{Ly}}}_{\\text{Unbinding}} $$\n    $$ \\frac{dC_b^{\\mathrm{Ly}}}{dt} = \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{el}} C_b^{\\mathrm{EE}}}_{\\text{In from EE}} - \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{le}} C_b^{\\mathrm{Ly}}}_{\\text{Out to EE}} + \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{\\mathrm{Ly}} a_{\\mathrm{Ly}} C_u^{\\mathrm{Ly}}}_{\\text{Binding}} - \\underbrace{k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{\\mathrm{Ly}} C_b^{\\mathrm{Ly}}}_{\\text{Unbinding}} $$\n\nThis system of $8$ coupled ODEs defines the dynamics of the system. The initial condition is given by $y(0) = [T, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$, with $T=1.0$.\n\n### Numerical Solution Strategy\nThe system will be solved numerically using an appropriate ODE solver. Due to the potential for different timescales between trafficking (slow) and binding/unbinding (potentially fast), the system may be stiff. Therefore, a numerical integration method designed for stiff ODEs, such as the Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF), is appropriate. We will use the `solve_ivp` function from the `scipy.integrate` library with the method set to 'BDF'.\n\nFor each parameter set provided in the test suite, we integrate the system from $t = 0$ to $t = t_{\\mathrm{end}} = 200000 \\ \\mathrm{s}$. The final state vector $y(t_{\\mathrm{end}})$ is used to calculate the fraction of bound CD1:\n$$ F_{\\mathrm{bound}}(t_{\\mathrm{end}}) = \\frac{C_b^{\\mathrm{ER}}(t_{\\mathrm{end}}) + C_b^{\\mathrm{G}}(t_{\\mathrm{end}}) + C_b^{\\mathrm{EE}}(t_{\\mathrm{end}}) + C_b^{\\mathrm{Ly}}(t_{\\mathrm{end}})}{T} $$\nSince $T=1.0$, this is simply the sum of concentrations of bound species: $C_b^{\\mathrm{ER}}(t_{\\mathrm{end}}) + C_b^{\\mathrm{G}}(t_{\\mathrm{end}}) + C_b^{\\mathrm{EE}}(t_{\\mathrm{end}}) + C_b^{\\mathrm{Ly}}(t_{\\mathrm{end}})$. The result for each case will be rounded to exactly six decimal places.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the ODE system for CD1 trafficking and antigen loading for different parameter sets.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: CD1b-like, Ly-centric loading\n        {\n            \"k_eg\": 1e-4, \"k_ge\": 1e-4, \"k_el\": 5e-4, \"k_le\": 5e-5,\n            \"k_on_EE\": 2e-4, \"k_off_EE\": 1e-5, \"a_EE\": 1e-1,\n            \"k_on_Ly\": 1e-3, \"k_off_Ly\": 1e-5, \"a_Ly\": 1.0,\n        },\n        # Case B: CD1a-like, EE-biased loading\n        {\n            \"k_eg\": 1e-4, \"k_ge\": 1e-4, \"k_el\": 1e-5, \"k_le\": 2e-4,\n            \"k_on_EE\": 6e-4, \"k_off_EE\": 1e-5, \"a_EE\": 5e-1,\n            \"k_on_Ly\": 1e-3, \"k_off_Ly\": 1e-5, \"a_Ly\": 1.0,\n        },\n        # Case C: No antigen available\n        {\n            \"k_eg\": 1e-4, \"k_ge\": 1e-4, \"k_el\": 5e-4, \"k_le\": 5e-5,\n            \"k_on_EE\": 2e-4, \"k_off_EE\": 1e-5, \"a_EE\": 0.0,\n            \"k_on_Ly\": 1e-3, \"k_off_Ly\": 1e-5, \"a_Ly\": 0.0,\n        },\n        # Case D: High unbinding\n        {\n            \"k_eg\": 1e-4, \"k_ge\": 1e-4, \"k_el\": 5e-4, \"k_le\": 5e-5,\n            \"k_on_EE\": 2e-4, \"k_off_EE\": 2e-3, \"a_EE\": 1e-1,\n            \"k_on_Ly\": 1e-3, \"k_off_Ly\": 2e-3, \"a_Ly\": 1.0,\n        },\n    ]\n\n    # Global constants\n    T_total = 1.0\n    t_end = 200000.0\n\n    # Initial conditions: all CD1 is unbound in ER\n    y0 = np.array([T_total, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])\n    \n    # Time span for integration\n    t_span = (0.0, t_end)\n\n    results = []\n\n    for params in test_cases:\n        \n        # Define the system of ODEs\n        def ode_system(t, y, p):\n            \"\"\"\n            Defines the 8-component ODE system for CD1 dynamics.\n            y: state vector [Cu_ER, Cb_ER, Cu_G, Cb_G, Cu_EE, Cb_EE, Cu_Ly, Cb_Ly]\n            p: dictionary of parameters\n            \"\"\"\n            Cu_ER, Cb_ER, Cu_G, Cb_G, Cu_EE, Cb_EE, Cu_Ly, Cb_Ly = y\n            \n            # Derivatives\n            dCu_ER_dt = -p[\"k_eg\"] * Cu_ER\n            dCb_ER_dt = -p[\"k_eg\"] * Cb_ER\n            \n            dCu_G_dt = p[\"k_eg\"] * Cu_ER - p[\"k_ge\"] * Cu_G\n            dCb_G_dt = p[\"k_eg\"] * Cb_ER - p[\"k_ge\"] * Cb_G\n            \n            binding_EE = p[\"k_on_EE\"] * p[\"a_EE\"] * Cu_EE\n            unbinding_EE = p[\"k_off_EE\"] * Cb_EE\n            dCu_EE_dt = p[\"k_ge\"] * Cu_G + p[\"k_le\"] * Cu_Ly - p[\"k_el\"] * Cu_EE - binding_EE + unbinding_EE\n            dCb_EE_dt = p[\"k_ge\"] * Cb_G + p[\"k_le\"] * Cb_Ly - p[\"k_el\"] * Cb_EE + binding_EE - unbinding_EE\n            \n            binding_Ly = p[\"k_on_Ly\"] * p[\"a_Ly\"] * Cu_Ly\n            unbinding_Ly = p[\"k_off_Ly\"] * Cb_Ly\n            dCu_Ly_dt = p[\"k_el\"] * Cu_EE - p[\"k_le\"] * Cu_Ly - binding_Ly + unbinding_Ly\n            dCb_Ly_dt = p[\"k_el\"] * Cb_EE - p[\"k_le\"] * Cb_Ly + binding_Ly - unbinding_Ly\n            \n            return [dCu_ER_dt, dCb_ER_dt, dCu_G_dt, dCb_G_dt, \n                    dCu_EE_dt, dCb_EE_dt, dCu_Ly_dt, dCb_Ly_dt]\n\n        # Solve the ODE system using a stiff-capable method (BDF)\n        # t_eval=[t_end] requests the solution only at the final time point for efficiency\n        sol = solve_ivp(ode_system, t_span, y0, method='BDF', args=(params,), t_eval=[t_end])\n\n        if not sol.success:\n            # Handle potential integration failure, though unlikely for this system.\n            # For this problem, we assume success.
