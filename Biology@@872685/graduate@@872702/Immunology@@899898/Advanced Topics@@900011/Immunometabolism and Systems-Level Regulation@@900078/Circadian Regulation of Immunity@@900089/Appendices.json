By considering the consequences of a `Cry1/2` double knockout in macrophages ([@problem_id:2841122]), you will explore the dual function of Cryptochrome proteins, which act both as core components of the circadian clock's negative feedback loop and as direct repressors of inflammatory signaling. Mastering this type of predictive reasoning is essential for designing experiments and interpreting data in chrono-immunology.", "problem": "A laboratory investigates time-of-day gating of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) responses in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages under constant conditions after a single serum-shock synchronization. In wild-type cells, brief LPS stimulation (fixed dose and duration) produces a robust induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA that is maximal near circadian time (CT) $12$ and minimal near CT $0$, consistent with circadian gating of Toll-like receptor $4$ (TLR4)–nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling. The team plans to repeat the time-course in macrophages with a double knockout of Cryptochrome $1$ and Cryptochrome $2$ (Cry$1/2$ double knockout), restricted to the myeloid lineage, and asks you to predict how the LPS time-of-day response curve will change and to justify the prediction mechanistically from first principles of the circadian transcription–translation feedback loop and innate immune signaling.\n\nBase your reasoning only on foundational and widely accepted principles: (i) the central dogma of molecular biology (DNA→RNA→protein), (ii) the core mammalian circadian clock architecture in which the basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor complex BMAL1:CLOCK drives E-box transcription of Period (Per) and Cryptochrome (Cry) genes and outputs, while PER:CRY complexes feed back to inhibit BMAL1:CLOCK activity; and (iii) canonical LPS signaling through TLR$4$–MyD$88$/TRIF into NF-κB– and interferon regulatory factor–dependent transcription.

The curve becomes largely arrhythmic with an upward shift (higher baseline and uniformly higher LPS-induced transcription at essentially all circadian times), because loss of CRY removes repression of BMAL1:CLOCK leading to collapse of circadian output oscillations (loss of rhythmic chromatin gating) and eliminates CRY-mediated dampening of proinflammatory signaling (for example, reduced inhibition of NF-κB/cyclic adenosine monophosphate–protein kinase A axes), thereby enhancing signal flux irrespective of clock phase.\n\nB. The curve inverts its phase and shows increased amplitude, because CRY normally drives the antiphase of the loop; removing CRY causes BMAL1 activity to oscillate in opposite phase, shifting the time of maximal NF-κB responsiveness while enhancing clock-controlled gating.\n\nC. Time-of-day differences are preserved but with reduced amplitude, because constitutively elevated expression of REV-ERB nuclear receptors under high BMAL1:CLOCK drive imposes stronger repression of inflammatory gene promoters selectively at former peak phases, thereby compressing responses without abolishing the phase relationship.\n\nD.

The molecular components ($CRY1/2$, $CLOCK$, $BMAL1$, $TLR4$, NF-κB) and their described interactions are based on established, foundational concepts in molecular biology, circadian rhythms, and immunology. The phenomenon of circadian gating of the immune response to $LPS$ is well-documented.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The question asks for a prediction based on a clearly defined genetic perturbation ($Cry1/2$ DKO) and a specified set of first principles. The system (macrophages) and the expected output (a time-course response curve) are unambiguous. A logical, unique solution can be derived from the provided principles.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is technical and precise, devoid of subjective or speculative claims.\n\nThe problem statement contains no scientific or factual unsoundness, is not metaphorical, is complete, is feasible, and is not trivial. It requires the integration of knowledge from multiple domains to arrive at a mechanistically sound conclusion.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe solution requires dissecting the consequences of $Cry1/2$ double knockout from first principles. This must be analyzed at two levels: the effect on the core circadian oscillator and the effect on the immune signaling pathway output.\n\n1.  **Effect on the Core Circadian Clock**: In the canonical mammalian transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL), the BMAL1:CLOCK heterodimer acts as the primary transcriptional activator, driving expression of genes containing E-box elements in their promoters. Among these are the $Per$ and $Cry$ genes. The resulting $PER$ and $CRY$ proteins accumulate, heterodimerize in the cytoplasm, and translocate to the nucleus to form the primary negative feedback complex. This $PER:CRY$ complex directly binds to and inhibits the transcriptional activity of BMAL1:CLOCK. This inhibition is relieved as $PER$ and $CRY$ proteins are degraded, allowing a new cycle of transcription to begin. The entire cycle takes approximately $24$ hours.\n\n    The genetic ablation of both $Cry1$ and $Cry2$ removes an essential component of the negative feedback complex. Without $CRY$ proteins, the $PER:CRY$ repressor complex cannot form effectively. $PER$ proteins alone are less stable and are inefficient inhibitors of BMAL1:CLOCK. Consequently, the negative feedback is abolished. This leads to the **collapse of the core clock oscillator**. The rhythmic activity of BMAL1:CLOCK ceases, and it instead becomes constitutively active at a high level. As a direct result, the rhythmic expression of all clock-controlled genes (CCGs) is lost, and the cellular state becomes **arrhythmic**. Therefore, any biological process, including the response to $LPS$, that is rhythmically gated by the clock in wild-type cells will lose its rhythmicity in $Cry1/2$ DKO cells. The response curve will flatten.\n\n2.  **Effect on the LPS Response Amplitude**: Having established that the response will be arrhythmic, we must determine the level of this constant response. This requires considering the clock's influence on the $TLR4-NF-κB$ pathway. In wild-type cells, the response to $LPS$ is minimal at CT $0$ and maximal at CT $12$. CT $0$ is the time of peak BMAL1:CLOCK activity, while CT $12$ is near the time of peak $CRY$-mediated repression of BMAL1:CLOCK.\n\n    Two main mechanisms must be considered for the effect of $Cry1/2$ knockout:\n    a.  **Consequence of Constitutive BMAL1:CLOCK Activity**: High BMAL1:CLOCK activity drives high expression of its target genes, including transcriptional repressors such as the nuclear receptor $REV-ERB\\alpha$. $REV-ERB\\alpha$ is known to repress the transcription of key inflammatory genes. In $Cry1/2$ DKO cells, with constitutively high BMAL1:CLOCK activity, one would expect constitutively high $REV-ERB\\alpha$ levels, which would impose a constant state of repression on inflammatory targets. By this logic alone, one might predict a uniformly low response, similar to the trough seen at CT $0$ in wild-type cells.\n\n    b.  **Loss of CRY's Direct Immunomodulatory Function**: Crucially, $CRY$ proteins have functions beyond their role as core clock components. They act as direct molecular repressors in various signaling pathways. It is well-established that $CRY$ proteins can interact with key components of the NF-κB signaling cascade, such as the $p65$ ($RelA$) subunit, to suppress its transcriptional activity. They also modulate other inflammatory pathways. This function serves as a direct brake on inflammation. The genetic removal of $Cry1$ and $Cry2$ eliminates this braking mechanism.\n\n    Reconciling these two effects is key. Extensive experimental evidence from the field demonstrates that the loss of $CRY$-mediated suppression is the dominant effect. Macrophages lacking $Cry1$ and $Cry2$ exhibit a **hyper-inflammatory** phenotype. The removal of the direct $CRY$ brake on the NF-κB pathway leads to a significantly potentiated transcriptional response to stimuli like $LPS$. This effect outweighs the repressive influence of constitutively high $REV-ERB\\alpha$.\n\n    **Conclusion**: The combination of these effects—the collapse of rhythmicity and the removal of a key inflammatory repressor—predicts that the LPS-induced TNF-$\\alpha$ response curve in $Cry1/2$ DKO macrophages will be **largely arrhythmic with a significant upward shift** in magnitude compared to the wild-type average. The response will be high at all time points, exceeding the average wild-type response and potentially even the peak wild-type response.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. The curve becomes largely arrhythmic with an upward shift (higher baseline and uniformly higher LPS-induced transcription at essentially all circadian times), because loss of CRY removes repression of BMAL1:CLOCK leading to collapse of circadian output oscillations (loss of rhythmic chromatin gating) and eliminates CRY-mediated dampening of proinflammatory signaling (for example, reduced inhibition of NF-κB/cyclic adenosine monophosphate–protein kinase A axes), thereby enhancing signal flux irrespective of clock phase.**\nThis option correctly predicts both consequences of the $Cry1/2$ DKO: arrhythmicity and a general increase in response magnitude (upward shift). The justification is also mechanistically sound. It correctly identifies that loss of $CRY$ breaks the clock loop, causing a \"collapse of circadian output oscillations.\" It also correctly identifies the second, critical mechanism: the elimination of \"CRY-mediated dampening of proinflammatory signaling\" (e.g., via NF-κB), which explains the upward shift. The overall conclusion is consistent with established first principles and experimental findings.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The curve inverts its phase and shows increased amplitude, because CRY normally drives the antiphase of the loop; removing CRY causes BMAL1 activity to oscillate in opposite phase, shifting the time of maximal NF-κB responsiveness while enhancing clock-controlled gating.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. Removing an essential component of an oscillator's negative feedback loop, such as $CRY$, does not cause the oscillator to run in antiphase. It causes the oscillator to stop. Therefore, the premise that \"BMAL1 activity to oscillate in opposite phase\" is incorrect. The clock becomes arrhythmic, it does not invert its phase.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Time-of-day differences are preserved but with reduced amplitude, because constitutively elevated expression of REV-ERB nuclear receptors under high BMAL1:CLOCK drive imposes stronger repression of inflammatory gene promoters selectively at former peak phases, thereby compressing responses without abolishing the phase relationship.**\nThis option is incorrect because its primary prediction, that \"Time-of-day differences are preserved,\" is false. A $Cry1/2$ DKO leads to arrhythmicity, not a preserved rhythm. While the reasoning regarding elevated $REV-ERB$ expression is plausible in isolation, it cannot maintain a rhythmic pattern in the absence of a functioning core clock. Repression from a constitutively expressed repressor would be constant, not rhythmic.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The LPS response is abolished across the day, because disruption of the circadian clock prevents TLR4–NF-κB signaling from transmitting to target gene transcription.**\nThis option makes an extreme and incorrect claim. The circadian clock *modulates* or *gates* the NF-κB signaling pathway; it is not a prerequisite for its basic function. The problem's assumptions state that $TLR4$ expression is not impaired. The fundamental signaling machinery from receptor to transcription factor remains intact. Disruption of the clock's modulatory input would alter the response's magnitude and timing, not abolish it entirely. As reasoned above, the response is expected to be enhanced, not eliminated.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2841122"}, {"introduction": "Building on the cellular level, this practice asks you to scale up your thinking to the whole organism.

Assume the following foundational facts and definitions.\n\n- The molecular circadian clock in myeloid cells is built on a transcription–translation feedback loop in which Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput (CLOCK) and Brain and Muscle ARNT-Like 1 (BMAL1) drive transcription of Period ($Per$) and Cryptochrome ($Cry$) genes, as well as Nuclear Receptor Subfamily $1$ Group D Member $1$ (NR$1$D$1$, also called REV-ERB$\\alpha$), which in turn repress clock-controlled outputs with near $24$-hour periodicity.\n- Toll-like receptor $4$ (TLR$4$) stimulation by LPS activates the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway and induces proinflammatory cytokines (for example, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-$\\alpha$), interleukin-$6$ (IL-$6$)) and inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS, also called NOS$2$). Nitric oxide (NO) produced by iNOS in myeloid cells contributes to vasodilation and hypotension in endotoxemia.\n- Hemodynamically, mean arterial pressure satisfies $P_{\\mathrm{MAP}}(t) = Q(t)\\cdot R(t)$, where $Q(t)$ is cardiac output and $R(t)$ is systemic vascular resistance.

The time-of-day difference in hypotension is largely abolished and overall hypotension is exaggerated at both $ZT0$ and $ZT12$, because loss of BMAL1 removes cell-autonomous circadian repression of NF-κB targets (including $Nos2$), increasing NO and proinflammatory cytokines across the cycle.\n\nB.

The time-of-day difference is amplified, with deeper troughs at $ZT12$ and higher MAP at $ZT0$, because BMAL1 normally buffers vasoactive cytokine output; its loss increases the amplitude of circadian NF-κB oscillations.\n\nD.

The roles of $BMAL1$, REV-ERB$\\alpha$, TLR$4$, NF-κB, and iNOS in circadian rhythm and endotoxemia are well-documented in scientific literature. The described interactions are a standard model in the field.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear initial state (WT response), a specific perturbation (myeloid $Bmal1$ knockout), and a well-defined question (predict the change in diurnal response). The provided mechanistic details are sufficient to deduce a unique and logical outcome.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjectivity.\n- **Self-Contained and Consistent:** The givens are internally consistent. The observation that the LPS response is stronger at $ZT12$ (start of the active phase) is consistent with the known mechanism where repressive clock elements, driven by $BMAL1$ (which peaks during the rest phase), dampen inflammation. Therefore, during the rest phase (around $ZT0$), repression is high, and during the active phase (around $ZT12$), repression is low. The premises support each other and lead to a non-contradictory logical framework.\n- **Feasible and Realistic:** The experimental setup described (myeloid-specific knockout, LPS challenge at different Zeitgeber times) is a standard and feasible procedure in biomedical research.\n\nThe problem statement has no identifiable flaws. It is scientifically sound, logically coherent, and well-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. Proceeding to solution derivation.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\n The objective is to predict the effect of myeloid-specific $Bmal1$ deletion on the diurnal variation of LPS-induced hypotension.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Wild-Type (WT) Circadian Response:**\n    The problem states that in WT mice, an LPS challenge at $ZT12$ induces a greater drop in mean arterial pressure ($P_{\\mathrm{MAP}}$) than at $ZT0$. A drop in $P_{\\mathrm{MAP}}$ is hypotension. This hypotension is caused by vasodilation, which results from a decrease in systemic vascular resistance $R(t)$. The primary driver of this vasodilation in the context of endotoxemia is nitric oxide (NO), produced by the enzyme iNOS (encoded by the $Nos2$ gene) in myeloid cells. Formally, a larger drop in $P_{\\mathrm{MAP}}$ implies a larger decrease in $R(t)$, which implies a larger production of NO, and thus higher induction of $Nos2$ and other proinflammatory genes via the NF-κB pathway.\n    Therefore, the inflammatory response to LPS is stronger at $ZT12$ and weaker at $ZT0$.\n\n    The provided mechanism is that \"circadian gating modulates NF-κB-dependent transcription ... via BMAL1-driven outputs (for example, through REV-ERB$\\alpha$) that repress selected inflammatory genes\".\n    - BMAL1 is a core transcriptional activator of the clock. Its expression and activity peak during the rest phase (for a nocturnal rodent, this is the light phase, which starts at $ZT0$).\n    - BMAL1 drives the expression of the repressor REV-ERB$\\alpha$. The protein product, REV-ERB$\\alpha$, accumulates with a delay and reaches its peak levels during the subjective day.\n    - High levels of REV-ERB$\\alpha$ repress target genes, including inflammatory genes like $Nos2$. This explains why the inflammatory response at $ZT0$ (start of rest phase) is dampened.\n    - Conversely, at $ZT12$ (start of active phase), $BMAL1$ activity is low, leading to low levels of its target REV-ERB$\\alpha$. The repressive brake on inflammatory genes is released. This explains why the inflammatory response at $ZT12$ is strong.\n    This model is fully consistent with the givens.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Myeloid-Specific $Bmal1$ Knockout (KO) Mouse:**\n    In this mouse, the $Bmal1$ gene is deleted specifically in myeloid cells.\n    - The consequence is the ablation of the cell-autonomous molecular clock in these cells. Without $BMAL1$, the entire transcriptional-translational feedback loop, including the rhythmic expression of $Per$, $Cry$, and importantly, the repressor $REV-ERB\\alpha$, is lost.\n    - The rhythmic gating of the inflammatory response, which depends on rhythmic levels of repressors like REV-ERB$\\alpha$, is therefore eliminated.\n    - In the WT mouse, the system at $ZT0$ is in a \"repressed\" state, and at $ZT12$ it is in a \"de-repressed\" or \"permissive\" state. In the $Bmal1$ KO, the primary driver ($BMAL1$) of the repressor ($REV-ERB\\alpha$) is gone. The system will therefore exist in a constitutively de-repressed state.\n    - **At $ZT0$**: The KO mouse lacks the repressive machinery that dampens the inflammatory response in the WT mouse. Therefore, the response to LPS will be much stronger than in a WT mouse at $ZT0$, and should approach the high level of response seen at $ZT12$.\n    - **At $ZT12$**: The WT mouse is already in a de-repressed state with a strong inflammatory response. In the KO mouse, the response will also be strong. It will be similar to, or potentially even stronger than, the WT at $ZT12$, as any residual repressive functions of the clock are now completely absent.\n    - **Overall change**: The difference in LPS response between $ZT0$ and $ZT12$ will be largely or completely abolished. The overall level of response across the $24$-hour cycle will be exaggerated, leading to more severe hypotension at both time points compared to the baseline response profile in WT mice (specifically, a large increase at $ZT0$ and maintenance of the high level at $ZT12$).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The time-of-day difference in hypotension is largely abolished and overall hypotension is exaggerated at both $ZT0$ and $ZT12$, because loss of BMAL1 removes cell-autonomous circadian repression of NF-κB targets (including $Nos2$), increasing NO and proinflammatory cytokines across the cycle.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement aligns perfectly with the derivation. Loss of $BMAL1$ ablates the clock in myeloid cells, removing the rhythmic repression of inflammatory genes. This leads to a constitutively de-repressed state, causing a hyper-inflammatory response (exaggerated hypotension) at both $ZT0$ and $ZT12$, thus abolishing the time-of-day difference. The mechanism provided is correct.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. The phase of the diurnal difference is inverted but the magnitude is unchanged, because loss of BMAL1 flips the myeloid clock phase, shifting peak iNOS expression from $ZT12$ to $ZT0$.**\n- **Evaluation:** A knockout of a core, non-redundant clock component like $BMAL1$ ablates the clock; it does not cause a phase inversion. An oscillator cannot \"flip its phase\" when its central driving component is removed; it ceases to oscillate. The mechanism proposed is fundamentally incorrect from a chronobiology standpoint.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The time-of-day difference is amplified, with deeper troughs at $ZT12$ and higher MAP at $ZT0$, because BMAL1 normally buffers vasoactive cytokine output; its loss increases the amplitude of circadian NF-κB oscillations.**\n- **Evaluation:** This is incorrect. Loss of $BMAL1$ eliminates circadian oscillations; it does not increase their amplitude. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm of inflammatory gene expression in myeloid cells would be reduced to near zero. A non-oscillating system cannot have an amplified time-of-day difference.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. There is no meaningful change, because LPS-induced hypotension is determined almost exclusively by endothelial endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS) and cardiac output; myeloid-specific clock disruption does not affect $R(t)$ in $P_{\\mathrm{MAP}}(t) = Q(t)\\cdot R(t)$.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement directly contradicts the premises of the problem. The problem explicitly states that \"Nitric oxide (NO) produced by iNOS in myeloid cells contributes to vasodilation and hypotension\". It also states that circadian gating in myeloid cells modulates NF-κB-dependent transcription. Therefore, myeloid-specific clock disruption must affect iNOS and subsequently affect systemic vascular resistance $R(t)$.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The time-of-day difference is abolished and hypotension is attenuated at both $ZT0$ and $ZT12$, because BMAL1 is required for $Nos2$ induction and its loss reduces NO production regardless of time of day.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option correctly predicts the abolition of the time-of-day difference but incorrectly predicts the direction of the change in overall response. It proposes that hypotension is attenuated (weakened). This would imply that $BMAL1$ is a direct and necessary activator for $Nos2$ induction. However, the provided WT data (stronger response at $ZT12$ when $BMAL1$ activity is low, weaker response at $ZT0$ when $BMAL1$ activity is high) contradicts this mechanism. The data strongly supports a model where the net effect of the $BMAL1$-driven clock is repressive during the rest phase. Therefore, loss of $BMAL1$ should lead to de-repression and an exaggerated, not attenuated, response.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2841077"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the conceptual and systemic aspects of circadian immunity, the final practice shifts to the quantitative methods used to characterize these rhythms.

Consider the $24$ h single-component cosinor model\n$$\ny(t) \\;=\\; M \\;+\\; A \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{24}\\big(t - \\phi\\big)\\right),\n$$\nwhere $M$ is the mesor (mean level), $A$ is the amplitude, and $\\phi$ (in hours) is the acrophase (time-of-day of peak).\n\nYou are given the following sufficient summaries computed from the hourly data with angular frequency $\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{24}$:\n- $N = 48$,\n- $\\sum_{k=0}^{47} y_k \\;=\\; 105.6$,\n- $\\sum_{k=0}^{47} y_k^2 \\;=\\; 248.13$,\n- $\\sum_{k=0}^{47} y_k \\cos(\\omega t_k) \\;=\\; 4.34784$,\n- $\\sum_{k=0}^{47} y_k \\sin(\\omega t_k) \\;=\\; 16.22712$.\n\nBecause the sampling spans exactly two full $24$ h cycles with equal spacing, you may use the orthogonality identities\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{47} \\cos(\\omega t_k) \\;=\\; 0,\\quad \\sum_{k=0}^{47} \\sin(\\omega t_k) \\;=\\; 0,\\quad \\sum_{k=0}^{47} \\cos(\\omega t_k)\\sin(\\omega t_k)\\;=\\; 0,\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{47} \\cos^2(\\omega t_k) \\;=\\; 24,\\quad \\sum_{k=0}^{47} \\sin^2(\\omega t_k) \\;=\\; 24.\n$$\n\nFit the cosinor model by ordinary least squares, derive from first principles the point estimates $\\hat M$, $\\hat A$, and $\\hat\\phi$ and their $95\\%$ confidence intervals, treating the residuals as independent, homoscedastic, mean-zero Gaussian errors. Use the Student’s $t$ critical value $t_{0.975,\\,45} = 2.014$ for $95\\%$ intervals and the delta method where needed. Report $M$ and $A$ in pg/mL and $\\phi$ in hours. Round the three point estimates $\\hat M$, $\\hat A$, and $\\hat\\phi$ to four significant figures for the final answer, and round each reported confidence-interval endpoint to three significant figures. Express the final answer as a single row vector containing only the three point estimates, with no units included in that vector.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in chronobiology and statistics, namely, the fitting of a cosinor model to time-series data using the method of ordinary least squares (OLS). All necessary data, including summary statistics and orthogonality conditions, are provided and internally consistent. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be furnished.\n\nThe non-linear cosinor model is given by\n$$\ny(t) = M + A \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{24}(t - \\phi)\\right)\n$$\nwhere the parameters are the mesor $M$, amplitude $A$, and acrophase $\\phi$. The angular frequency is $\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{24} \\, \\text{rad/h}$. To apply linear least squares, the model must be linearized with respect to its parameters. Using the trigonometric identity $\\cos(x-y) = \\cos(x)\\cos(y) + \\sin(x)\\sin(y)$, we can rewrite the model as:\n$$\ny(t) = M + A \\cos(\\omega\\phi)\\cos(\\omega t) + A \\sin(\\omega\\phi)\\sin(\\omega t)\n$$\nWe define two new parameters, $\\beta = A \\cos(\\omega\\phi)$ and $\\gamma = A \\sin(\\omega\\phi)$. The model becomes a multiple linear regression model, linear in the parameters $M$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$:\n$$\ny_k = M + \\beta \\cos(\\omega t_k) + \\gamma \\sin(\\omega t_k) + \\epsilon_k\n$$\nwhere $t_k = k$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 47\\}$ and $\\epsilon_k$ are the error terms. The goal of OLS is to find the parameter estimates $(\\hat{M}, \\hat{\\beta}, \\hat{\\gamma})$ that minimize the sum of squared residuals, $S(M, \\beta, \\gamma) = \\sum_{k=0}^{47} (y_k - (M + \\beta\\cos(\\omega t_k) + \\gamma\\sin(\\omega t_k)))^2$.\n\nThe normal equations for such a minimization problem are found by setting the partial derivatives of $S$ with respect to each parameter to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial M} = -2 \\sum_{k=0}^{47} (y_k - \\hat{M} - \\hat{\\beta}\\cos(\\omega t_k) - \\hat{\\gamma}\\sin(\\omega t_k)) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\beta} = -2 \\sum_{k=0}^{47} (y_k - \\hat{M} - \\hat{\\beta}\\cos(\\omega t_k) - \\hat{\\gamma}\\sin(\\omega t_k))\\cos(\\omega t_k) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\gamma} = -2 \\sum_{k=0}^{47} (y_k - \\hat{M} - \\hat{\\beta}\\cos(\\omega t_k) - \\hat{\\gamma}\\sin(\\omega t_k))\\sin(\\omega t_k) = 0\n$$\nRearranging and applying the provided orthogonality conditions simplifies this system dramatically. The conditions are $\\sum \\cos(\\omega t_k) = 0$, $\\sum \\sin(\\omega t_k) = 0$, $\\sum \\cos(\\omega t_k)\\sin(\\omega t_k) = 0$. The sums of squares are $\\sum \\cos^2(\\omega t_k) = N/2 = 24$ and $\\sum \\sin^2(\\omega t_k) = N/2 = 24$, where $N=48$.\n\nFrom the first normal equation:\n$$\n\\sum y_k - N\\hat{M} - \\hat{\\beta}\\sum\\cos(\\omega t_k) - \\hat{\\gamma}\\sum\\sin(\\omega t_k) = 0 \\implies \\sum y_k - N\\hat{M} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{M} = \\frac{\\sum y_k}{N} = \\frac{105.6}{48} = 2.2\n$$\nFrom the second normal equation:\n$$\n\\sum y_k \\cos(\\omega t_k) - \\hat{M}\\sum\\cos(\\omega t_k) - \\hat{\\beta}\\sum\\cos^2(\\omega t_k) - \\hat{\\gamma}\\sum\\cos(\\omega t_k)\\sin(\\omega t_k) = 0 \\implies \\sum y_k \\cos(\\omega t_k) - \\hat{\\beta}(N/2) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta} = \\frac{\\sum y_k \\cos(\\omega t_k)}{N/2} = \\frac{4.34784}{24} = 0.18116\n$$\nFrom the third normal equation:\n$$\n\\sum y_k \\sin(\\omega t_k) - \\hat{M}\\sum\\sin(\\omega t_k) - \\hat{\\beta}\\sum\\cos(\\omega t_k)\\sin(\\omega t_k) - \\hat{\\gamma}\\sum\\sin^2(\\omega t_k) = 0 \\implies \\sum y_k \\sin(\\omega t_k) - \\hat{\\gamma}(N/2) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{\\gamma} = \\frac{\\sum y_k \\sin(\\omega t_k)}{N/2} = \\frac{16.22712}{24} = 0.67613\n$$\nNow we transform these estimates back to the original parameters $A$ and $\\phi$ using the definitions $\\beta = A \\cos(\\omega\\phi)$ and $\\gamma = A \\sin(\\omega\\phi)$:\n$$\n\\hat{A} = \\sqrt{\\hat{\\beta}^2 + \\hat{\\gamma}^2} = \\sqrt{(0.18116)^2 + (0.67613)^2} = \\sqrt{0.032819 + 0.457151} = \\sqrt{0.48997} \\approx 0.699979 \\, \\text{pg/mL}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega\\hat{\\phi} = \\operatorname{atan2}(\\hat{\\gamma}, \\hat{\\beta}) = \\operatorname{atan2}(0.67613, 0.18116) \\approx 1.3090 \\, \\text{rad}\n$$\nThe function $\\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)$ is used to determine the correct quadrant.

For an orthogonal design, this simplifies:\n$$\nRSS = \\sum y_k^2 - N\\hat{M}^2 - (N/2)\\hat{\\beta}^2 - (N/2)\\hat{\\gamma}^2 = \\sum y_k^2 - N\\hat{M}^2 - (N/2)(\\hat{\\beta}^2 + \\hat{\\gamma}^2)\n$$\nUsing the given values:\n$$\nRSS = 248.13 - 48(2.2)^2 - 24((0.18116)^2 + (0.67613)^2) = 248.13 - 232.32 - 24(0.48997)\n$$\n$$\nRSS = 15.81 - 11.75928 = 4.05072\n$$\nThe unbiased estimator for the error variance $\\sigma^2$ is $\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{RSS}{N-p}$, where $p=3$ is the number of parameters in the linear model.
