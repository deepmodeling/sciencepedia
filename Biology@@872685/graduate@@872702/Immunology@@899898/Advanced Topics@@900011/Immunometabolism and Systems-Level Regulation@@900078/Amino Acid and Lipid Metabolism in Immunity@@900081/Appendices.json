The core of the problem relies on the direct application of the Michaelis–Menten equation and principles of stoichiometry, which are fundamental to biochemistry.\n\nThere is a potential ambiguity in the problem's definition of survival time. It is stated that CPT1A produces palmitoyl-carnitine, which would replenish the pool, while survival time is defined as the time to deplete this same pool. However, the problem provides an explicit directive: \"Assuming the FAO flux remains constant... determine the survival time... defined as the time until the available palmitoyl–carnitine pool is depleted.\" This constitutes a specific, albeit simplified, model for the calculation. We are instructed to treat the pool as a finite resource consumed at a constant rate, where this rate is determined by the CPT1A kinetics. As the problem is well-defined under this explicit assumption, it is considered valid and solvable as stated.\n\nThe solution will proceed in four steps as requested.\n\n1.  Compute the CPT1A-limited flux of palmitoyl units, $v$.\nThe rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction following Michaelis–Menten kinetics is given by the equation:\n$$v = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_{m} + [S]}$$\nwhere $v$ is the reaction velocity, $V_{\\max}$ is the maximal velocity, $K_{m}$ is the Michaelis constant, and $[S]$ is the substrate concentration. We are given $V_{\\max} = 5\\,\\mathrm{pmol\\,min^{-1}}$, $K_{m} = 20\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$, and $[S] = 50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$.

Compute the oxygen consumption rate, $\\mathrm{OCR_{FAO}}$.\nThe stoichiometry of complete palmitoyl oxidation is given as $23$ molecules of dioxygen ($\\mathrm{O}_{2}$) consumed per molecule of palmitoyl. The oxygen consumption rate is therefore the FAO flux multiplied by this stoichiometric ratio.\n$$\\mathrm{OCR_{FAO}} = v \\times 23 = \\left(\\frac{25}{7}\\,\\mathrm{pmol\\,min^{-1}}\\right) \\times 23 = \\frac{575}{7}\\,\\mathrm{pmol\\,O_{2}\\,min^{-1}}$$\nNumerically, $\\mathrm{OCR_{FAO}} \\approx 82.14\\,\\mathrm{pmol\\,O_{2}\\,min^{-1}}$ per $10^{6}$ cells.\n\n3.

The rate of ATP production is the FAO flux multiplied by this ratio.\n$$\\text{ATP Production Rate} = v \\times 108 = \\left(\\frac{25}{7}\\,\\mathrm{pmol\\,min^{-1}}\\right) \\times 108 = \\frac{2700}{7}\\,\\mathrm{pmol\\,min^{-1}}$$\nTo evaluate if this meets the basal demand, we compare this value to the required $250\\,\\mathrm{pmol\\,min^{-1}}$.\n$$\\frac{2700}{7} \\approx 385.7\\,\\mathrm{pmol\\,min^{-1}}$$\nSince $385.7\\,\\mathrm{pmol\\,min^{-1}} > 250\\,\\mathrm{pmol\\,min^{-1}}$, the ATP production rate from FAO is sufficient to meet the basal energy demand of the cells.\n\n4.  Determine the survival time under glucose withdrawal.\nThe survival time is defined as the time until the available palmitoyl-carnitine pool is depleted. The rate of consumption of this pool is the constant FAO flux, $v$.\nThe total amount of available fuel is the palmitoyl-carnitine pool:\n$$\\text{Pool Size} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{nmol} = 1.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{pmol} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{pmol}$$\nThe rate of consumption is the FAO flux:\n$$\\text{Consumption Rate} = v = \\frac{25}{7}\\,\\mathrm{pmol\\,min^{-1}}$$\nThe time to deplete the pool is the total amount divided by the rate of consumption:\n$$\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Pool Size}}{\\text{Consumption Rate}} = \\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{pmol}}{\\frac{25}{7}\\,\\mathrm{pmol\\,min^{-1}}} = \\frac{1000 \\times 7}{25}\\,\\mathrm{min} = 40 \\times 7\\,\\mathrm{min} = 280\\,\\mathrm{min}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer in hours.

We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities: the steady-state palmitate uptake rate per cell and the total amount of triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulated per cell over a specified time. The solution is derived from first principles: Michaelis-Menten kinetics for membrane transport and the law of conservation of mass for metabolic flux.\n\nFirst, we determine the palmitate uptake rate, $v_0$. The transport is mediated by a finite number of CD36 transporters, each with a specific turnover rate. This process is therefore saturable and can be described by the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$v_0 = V_{max} \\frac{[S]}{K_M + [S]}$$\nwhere $[S]$ is the extracellular palmitate concentration ($80$ $\\mu$M), $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant for the transporter ($20$ $\\mu$M), and $V_{max}$ is the maximum rate of transport.\n\nThe maximum rate, $V_{max}$, is the product of the number of transporters per cell, $N_{CD36}$, and the catalytic turnover number, $k_{cat}$.\n$$V_{max} = N_{CD36} \\cdot k_{cat}$$\nGiven $N_{CD36} = 3.0 \\times 10^{5}$ transporters per cell and $k_{cat} = 40$ s$^{-1}$:\n$$V_{max} = (3.0 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ cell}^{-1}) \\cdot (40 \\text{ s}^{-1}) = 1.2 \\times 10^{7} \\text{ molecules s}^{-1} \\text{ cell}^{-1}$$\nTo use this value in the kinetic equation with molar concentrations, we must convert its units to pmol min$^{-1}$ cell$^{-1}$. This requires Avogadro's number, $N_A = 6.022 \\times 10^{23}$ mol$^{-1}$, and unit conversion factors for time ($60$ s min$^{-1}$) and molar quantity ($10^{12}$ pmol mol$^{-1}$).\n$$V_{max} = \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{7} \\text{ molecules s}^{-1} \\text{ cell}^{-1}}{N_A \\text{ molecules mol}^{-1}} \\times (60 \\text{ s min}^{-1}) \\times (10^{12} \\text{ pmol mol}^{-1})$$\n$$V_{max} = \\frac{(1.2 \\times 10^{7}) \\cdot (60) \\cdot (10^{12})}{6.022 \\times 10^{23}} \\text{ pmol min}^{-1} \\text{ cell}^{-1}$$\n$$V_{max} = \\frac{7.2 \\times 10^{20}}{6.022 \\times 10^{23}} \\text{ pmol min}^{-1} \\text{ cell}^{-1} \\approx 1.195616 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ pmol min}^{-1} \\text{ cell}^{-1}$$\nNow, we calculate the actual uptake rate $v_0$ by substituting the given values into the Michaelis-Menten equation.\n$$v_0 = (1.195616 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ pmol min}^{-1} \\text{ cell}^{-1}) \\cdot \\frac{80}{20 + 80}$$\n$$v_0 = (1.195616 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot \\frac{80}{100} = (1.195616 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot 0.8$$\n$$v_0 \\approx 9.56493 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ pmol min}^{-1} \\text{ cell}^{-1}$$\nThis is the first required quantity.\n\nSecond, we determine the amount of accumulated TAG. The principle of conservation of mass for the intracellular pool of palmitate dictates that the influx rate ($v_0$) must balance the sum of all efflux rates. The efflux pathways are mitochondrial oxidation ($v_{ox}$), non-storage anabolic usage ($v_{anab}$), and storage as TAG ($v_{palmitate \\to TAG}$).\n$$v_0 = v_{ox} + v_{anab} + v_{palmitate \\to TAG}$$\nWe are given the rates for the first two sinks:\n$$v_{ox} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ pmol min}^{-1} \\text{ cell}^{-1}$$\n$$v_{anab} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ pmol min}^{-1} \\text{ cell}^{-1}$$\nThe rate of palmitate flux directed to TAG synthesis is therefore the net influx remaining after the other sinks are supplied.\n$$v_{palmitate \\to TAG} = v_0 - v_{ox} - v_{anab}$$\n$$v_{palmitate \\to TAG} = (9.56493 \\times 10^{-4}) - (5.0 \\times 10^{-4}) - (5.0 \\times 10^{-5})$$\n$$v_{palmitate \\to TAG} = (9.56493 \\times 10^{-4}) - (5.0 \\times 10^{-4}) - (0.5 \\times 10^{-4})$$\n$$v_{palmitate \\to TAG} = (9.56493 - 5.0 - 0.5) \\times 10^{-4} = 4.06493 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ pmol min}^{-1} \\text{ cell}^{-1}$$\nThe total amount of palmitate incorporated into TAG, $M_{palmitate}$, over the time window $\\Delta t = 60$ min is the integral of this rate over time.

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem asks for $f_{\\mathrm{red}}$, the fraction of glutamine-derived citrate production flux that proceeds via reductive carboxylation. Let $V_{\\mathrm{red}}$ be the flux from glutamine to citrate via the reductive pathway, and $V_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ be the flux from glutamine to citrate via the oxidative pathway. The total glutamine-derived citrate production flux is $V_{\\mathrm{gln}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{cit}} = V_{\\mathrm{red}} + V_{\\mathrm{ox}}$. The quantity to be determined is:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{red}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{red}}}{V_{\\mathrm{red}} + V_{\\mathrm{ox}}}$$\nAt isotopic steady state, the fractional enrichment of a given isotopologue in a metabolite pool is proportional to the relative contribution of the flux that produces this specific isotopologue. Let $E_{X}[M+k]$ be the measured fractional enrichment of the $M+k$ isotopologue of metabolite $X$. The total production flux into the citrate pool is denoted $V_{\\mathrm{cit, total}}$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, from the labeled glutamine source pool (with fractional labeling $p_{\\mathrm{gln}}$):\n1.  Citrate $M+5$ is produced exclusively by the reductive carboxylation pathway. The flux producing this isotopologue is proportional to $V_{\\mathrm{red}} \\times p_{\\mathrm{gln}}$.\n2.  Citrate $M+4$ is produced exclusively by the oxidative TCA pathway. The flux producing this isotopologue is proportional to $V_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\times p_{\\mathrm{gln}}$.\n\nWe can write the steady-state balance equations for these two isotopologues:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{Cit}}[M+5] \\times V_{\\mathrm{cit, total}} = c \\cdot V_{\\mathrm{red}} \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{gln}}$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{Cit}}[M+4] \\times V_{\\mathrm{cit, total}} = c \\cdot V_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{gln}}$$\nwhere $c$ is a proportionality constant. Taking the ratio of these two equations eliminates the unknown terms $V_{\\mathrm{cit, total}}$, $p_{\\mathrm{gln}}$, and $c$:\n$$\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{Cit}}[M+5]}{E_{\\mathrm{Cit}}[M+4]} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{red}}}{V_{\\mathrm{ox}}}$$\nThis ratio of fluxes can be directly used to find $f_{\\mathrm{red}}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{red}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{red}}}{V_{\\mathrm{red}} + V_{\\mathrm{ox}}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{red}}/V_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{V_{\\mathrm{red}}/V_{\\mathrm{ox}} + 1}$$\nSubstituting the ratio of enrichments gives the expression for $f_{\\mathrm{red}}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{red}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{Cit}}[M+5]/E_{\\mathrm{Cit}}[M+4]}{E_{\\mathrm{Cit}}[M+5]/E_{\\mathrm{Cit}}[M+4] + 1} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{Cit}}[M+5]}{E_{\\mathrm{Cit}}[M+5] + E_{\\mathrm{Cit}}[M+4]}$$\nThis formula provides the most direct calculation of the required flux fraction, as it uses data from the metabolite pool (citrate) that is the direct subject of the question.\n\nThe provided aspartate data serves as a valuable consistency check. Aspartate is a proxy for oxaloacetate. Aspartate $M+3$ is a unique product of the reductive pathway followed by ATP-citrate lyase cleavage. Aspartate $M+4$ is a unique product of the oxidative pathway. The ratio of their enrichments is:\n$$\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{Asp}}[M+3]}{E_{\\mathrm{Asp}}[M+4]} = \\frac{0.10}{0.15} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nThe ratio of the corresponding citrate enrichments is:\n$$\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{Cit}}[M+5]}{E_{\\mathrm{Cit}}[M+4]} = \\frac{0.14}{0.21} = \\frac{14}{21} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nThe fact that these ratios are identical indicates that the data are internally consistent under the reasonable biological assumption that all reductively synthesized citrate available for cleavage is indeed cleaved to produce cytosolic acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. This confirms the validity of using the citrate data for our calculation.\n\nWe now compute the final value using the derived formula and the provided citrate data.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{Cit}}[M+5] = 0.14$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{Cit}}[M+4] = 0.21$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{red}} = \\frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.21} = \\frac{0.14}{0.35} = \\frac{14}{35} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
