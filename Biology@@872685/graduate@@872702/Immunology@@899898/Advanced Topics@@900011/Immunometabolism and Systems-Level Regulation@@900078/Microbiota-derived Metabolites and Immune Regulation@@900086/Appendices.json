It is complete, consistent, realistic, and formalizable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Fractional Activity**\nThe foundation of this model is the Hill-Langmuir equation, which describes the fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, of a macromolecule's binding sites by a ligand. For an inhibitor with concentration $[B]$ and a Hill coefficient $n$, the fractional occupancy is given by:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[B]^n}{K_d + [B]^n}\n$$\nwhere $K_d$ is a constant related to the dissociation of the inhibitor-enzyme complex.\n\nThe problem states that the fractional inhibition, denoted here as $I_{\\text{frac}}$, is equal to the fractional occupancy $\\theta$.\n$$\nI_{\\text{frac}} = \\theta = \\frac{[B]^n}{K_d + [B]^n}\n$$\nThe fractional activity $A$ is the portion of enzyme activity that remains in the presence of the inhibitor. Assuming the maximum activity is normalized to $1$, the fractional activity is:\n$$\nA = 1 - I_{\\text{frac}}\n$$\nNext, we must relate the constant $K_d$ to the given parameter $\\text{IC}_{50}$. The $\\text{IC}_{50}$ is defined as the inhibitor concentration at which the enzyme activity is reduced by one-half. This means that when $[B] = \\text{IC}_{50}$, the fractional activity $A = 0.5$. Consequently, the fractional inhibition $I_{\\text{frac}}$ must also be $0.5$.\n$$\nI_{\\text{frac}}([B] = \\text{IC}_{50}) = 1 - A([B] = \\text{IC}_{50}) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n$$\nSubstituting $[B] = \\text{IC}_{50}$ and $I_{\\text{frac}} = 0.5$ into the equation for fractional inhibition allows us to solve for $K_d$:\n$$\n0.5 = \\frac{(\\text{IC}_{50})^n}{K_d + (\\text{IC}_{50})^n}\n$$\n$$\n0.5(K_d + (\\text{IC}_{50})^n) = (\\text{IC}_{50})^n\n$$\n$$\n0.5 K_d + 0.5 (\\text{IC}_{50})^n = (\\text{IC}_{50})^n\n$$\n$$\n0.5 K_d = 0.5 (\\text{IC}_{50})^n\n$$\n$$\nK_d = (\\text{IC}_{50})^n\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $K_d$ back into the equation for fractional inhibition:\n$$\nI_{\\text{frac}} = \\frac{[B]^n}{(\\text{IC}_{50})^n + [B]^n}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this into the expression for fractional activity $A$:\n$$\nA = 1 - I_{\\text{frac}} = 1 - \\frac{[B]^n}{(\\text{IC}_{50})^n + [B]^n}\n$$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator:\n$$\nA = \\frac{(\\text{IC}_{50})^n + [B]^n}{(\\text{IC}_{50})^n + [B]^n} - \\frac{[B]^n}{(\\text{IC}_{50})^n + [B]^n}\n$$\n$$\nA = \\frac{(\\text{IC}_{50})^n + [B]^n - [B]^n}{(\\text{IC}_{50})^n + [B]^n}\n$$\nThis yields the final derived expression for fractional activity $A$:\n$$\nA = \\frac{(\\text{IC}_{50})^n}{(\\text{IC}_{50})^n + [B]^n}\n$$\nThis expression can also be written in the equivalent form $A = \\frac{1}{1 + ([B]/\\text{IC}_{50})^n}$, which is a standard representation of an inhibitory dose-response curve. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nThe second part of the problem requires the calculation of $A$ using the provided values: $[B] = 2 \\text{ mM}$, $\\text{IC}_{50} = 0.5 \\text{ mM}$, and $n=1$. The units (mM) are consistent and will cancel, yielding a dimensionless fraction as required.\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\nA = \\frac{(0.5)^1}{(0.5)^1 + (2)^1}\n$$\n$$\nA = \\frac{0.5}{0.5 + 2}\n$$\n$$\nA = \\frac{0.5}{2.5}\n$$\n$$\nA = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2\n$$\nThe problem demands the result be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe objective is to predict the effect of deleting TLR2 from DCs on the induction of Foxp3$^+$IL-10$^+$ Tregs by PSA. The reasoning must be strictly confined to the three given principles.\n\n1.  **Treg Induction Requirements:** According to principle (iii), the differentiation of naive CD4$^+$ T cells into Foxp3$^+$ Tregs requires a specific \"tolerogenic cytokine milieu\" provided by the DCs. This is signal $3$.\n\n2.  **Source of the Tolerogenic Milieu:** How do DCs acquire this tolerogenic state? The system is under \"neutral conditions,\" so no external cytokines are present. Therefore, the DCs themselves must be induced to produce these cytokines. The stimulus for this induction is PSA.\n\n3.  **Mechanism of DC Induction:** Principle (i) dictates the mechanism by which microbial molecules reprogram DCs. PSA, a microbial molecule, must be detected by a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) on the DC. This PRR signaling, through an adaptor like MyD88, is what \"reprogram[s] dendritic cell cytokines and costimulatory profiles\" to create the tolerogenic state. The problem explicitly names TLR2 as the PRR under investigation.\n\n4.  **The Role of Antigen Presentation:** Principle (ii) clarifies that for any T cell differentiation to occur, the T cell must first receive signal $1$, which is the presentation of antigen on MHC class II by the DC. PSA is a large polysaccharide and can be processed and presented by DCs. However, principle (ii) is adamant that \"signal $1$...must be integrated with costimulation and cytokines to specify T cell fate.\" Antigen presentation alone is insufficient.\n\n5.  **Synthesis and Prediction:** In the wild-type DC scenario, the following cascade occurs:\n    -   PSA binds to TLR2 on the DC.\n    -   TLR2 signaling (via MyD88, as per principle i) reprograms the DC to become tolerogenic, causing it to produce the required cytokines (principle iii).\n    -   The DC presents PSA-derived antigens on MHC class II (signal $1$) and provides the correct costimulatory signals (signal $2$) and cytokine milieu (signal $3$).\n    -   The naive CD4$^+$ T cell integrates these signals and differentiates into a Foxp3$^+$IL-10$^+$ Treg.\n\n    Now, consider the case of the TLR2-deficient DC:\n    -   PSA is present, but the DC lacks its specific receptor, TLR2.\n    -   Therefore, the PRR signaling cascade described in principle (i) cannot be initiated by PSA.\n    -   The DC is not reprogrammed. It does not adopt a tolerogenic profile and fails to produce the necessary cytokine milieu for Treg induction (violates the requirement of principle iii).\n    -   The DC may still present PSA on MHC class II (signal $1$), but according to principle (ii), this signal alone is insufficient to drive a specific T cell fate, particularly the complex differentiation into a Treg. Without the proper signals $2$ and $3$, Treg induction fails.\n\n    **Conclusion:** The deletion of TLR2 on DCs will critically impair or completely abolish the PSA-driven induction of Foxp3$^+$IL-10$^+$ Tregs.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A. The frequency of Foxp3$^+$ IL-10 Tregs is markedly decreased or abolished, because PSA-driven tolerogenic programming requires TLR2–MyD88 signaling in DCs to induce regulatory cytokines; MHC class II presentation alone under neutral conditions is insufficient to specify a Treg fate.**\n    -   This option correctly predicts a marked decrease or abolishment of Tregs. The justification perfectly integrates the provided principles: it invokes TLR2 signaling (principle i) as necessary for inducing regulatory cytokines (needed per principle iii), and correctly states that MHC class II presentation alone is insufficient (principle ii). The logic is sound and complete.\n    -   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n-   **B. The frequency of Foxp3$^+$ IL-10 Tregs is unchanged, because PSA is presented on MHC class II to provide signal $1$, and T cell receptor engagement alone is sufficient to induce Foxp3 in naive CD4$^+$ T cells without additional innate sensing.**\n    -   This option's prediction of an \"unchanged\" frequency is incorrect based on the derivation. The justification that \"T cell receptor engagement alone is sufficient\" is in direct contradiction to principle (ii), which states signal $1$ must be integrated with other signals, and principle (iii), which posits a requirement for a specific cytokine environment.\n    -   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **C. The frequency of Foxp3$^+$ IL-10 Tregs is increased, because loss of TLR2 removes proinflammatory signaling in DCs, rendering them constitutively tolerogenic and thereby enhancing Treg differentiation in response to PSA.**\n    -   This option's prediction of an \"increased\" frequency is contrary to the derivation. The justification makes an unsubstantiated assumption that TLR2 signaling is exclusively proinflammatory and that its absence defaults the DC to a tolerogenic state. The problem is framed around PSA *inducing* a tolerogenic program, not revealing a pre-existing one. Removing the receptor for the inducer logically prevents, not enhances, the outcome.\n    -   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. The frequency of Foxp3$^+$ IL-10 Tregs is only mildly reduced, because other innate sensors such as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) or nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) redundantly detect PSA and can substitute for TLR2 to drive an equivalent tolerogenic program in DCs.**\n    -   This option's prediction of a \"mildly reduced\" frequency is inconsistent with the critical role of TLR2 implied by the problem structure. The justification introduces new entities (TLR4, NOD2) and the concept of redundancy, which are not mentioned in the problem statement or the three foundational principles. Reasoning is to be based *only* on the provided principles.
