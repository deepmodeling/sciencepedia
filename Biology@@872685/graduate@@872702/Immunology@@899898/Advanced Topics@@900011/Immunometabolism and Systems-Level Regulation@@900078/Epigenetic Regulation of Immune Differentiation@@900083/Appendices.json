These concepts are fundamental in molecular biology.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The task is to design a principled procedure. While the design space is large, the constraints—monotonicity, affine invariance, and use of only provided data—are clear and restrictive enough to guide the construction of a non-arbitrary, meaningful scoring function. The evaluation metric is unambiguously defined.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical and biological terminology, free of subjective or ambiguous language.\n\nThe problem is a well-formulated quantitative biology task that requires the synthesis of biological first principles into a mathematical model. There are no logical contradictions, scientific inaccuracies, or missing information that would prevent a rigorous solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nWe will construct the solution in three stages: first, design the poising score; second, define the ground-truth labels; third, specify the evaluation procedure.\n\n**1. Design of the Poising Score ($s_i$)**\n\nThe design must satisfy three primary constraints: affine invariance, combination of features on a commensurate scale, and adherence to specified monotonic influences.\n\n**A. Affine Invariance and Feature Scaling**\nThe requirement that the score remains unchanged under an affine transformation of any feature vector $x^{(j)} \\to a \\cdot x^{(j)} + b$ (for $a>0$) is a powerful constraint. This property is naturally achieved by standardizing each feature vector. We will use Z-score standardization. For each feature vector $x^{(j)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^G$, we compute a standardized vector $z^{(j)}$ where the $i$-th component is given by:\n$$ z_i^{(j)} = \\frac{x_i^{(j)} - \\mu_j}{\\sigma_j} $$\nHere, $\\mu_j$ and $\\sigma_j$ are the mean and standard deviation of the vector $x^{(j)}$, respectively. This transformation rescales each feature vector to have a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $1$, placing all features on a common, dimensionless scale. If $\\sigma_j=0$ (i.e., all elements of $x^{(j)}$ are identical), the feature provides no information for ranking genes relative to each other. In this case, we define $z_i^{(j)} = 0$ for all $i$.\n\n**B. Integration of Biological Principles**\nThe poising score for a gene must reflect its readiness for future activation. The problem provides the following qualitative relationships:\n-   **H3K4me1 ($x^{(1)}$)**: A mark of poised enhancers, its presence is positively associated with future activation. Thus, a higher $z^{(1)}$ value should increase the poising score.\n-   **H3K27ac ($x^{(2)}$)**: A mark of active promoters and enhancers, its presence indicates current, not future, activation, thus reducing the \"poised\" state. A higher $z^{(2)}$ value should decrease the poising score.\n-   **H3K27me3 ($x^{(3)}$)**: A repressive mark, its presence is negatively associated with activation. A higher $z^{(3)}$ value should decrease the poising score.\n\nThe most direct and principled way to combine these influences, without introducing additional parameters or assumptions, is a linear model. The poising score $s_i$ for gene $i$ is formulated as a weighted sum of the standardized feature values:\n$$ s_i = w_1 z_i^{(1)} + w_2 z_i^{(2)} + w_3 z_i^{(3)} $$\nBased on the biological principles, the signs of the weights must be $w_1 > 0$, $w_2 < 0$, and $w_3 < 0$. In the absence of any information to justify differential weighting, we apply the principle of parsimony and assign weights of equal magnitude. The simplest choice that respects the signs is $w_1=1$, $w_2=-1$, and $w_3=-1$.\n\n**C. Final Poising Score Formula**\nThis leads to the final definition of the poising score for gene $i$:\n$$ s_i = z_i^{(1)} - z_i^{(2)} - z_i^{(3)} $$\nThis score is high for genes with strong priming marks and low levels of active and repressive marks, which is the canonical signature of a gene poised for activation.\n\n**2. Definition of Imminent Activation Labels ($y_i$)**\n\nThe ground truth for evaluating the predictive power of the poising score is derived from the change in gene expression. As specified, imminent activation for gene $i$ is determined by comparing the change in expression, $\\Delta e_i = e_{t+1,i} - e_{t,i}$, to a fixed threshold $\\Delta = 0.5$. The binary label $y_i$ is defined as:\n$$ y_i = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } e_{t+1,i} - e_{t,i} \\ge 0.5 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } e_{t+1,i} - e_{t,i} < 0.5 \\end{cases} $$\nA label of $y_i=1$ indicates that the gene is activated, while $y_i=0$ indicates it is not.\n\n**3. Evaluation via ROC-AUC**\n\nThe predictive performance of the poising score $s$ is quantified by the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC-AUC). The ROC-AUC is equivalent to the probability that a randomly selected positive sample (a gene with $y_i=1$) has a higher score $s_i$ than a randomly selected negative sample (a gene with $y_j=0$).\n\nLet $P = \\{i \\mid y_i=1\\}$ be the set of indices for positive instances and $N = \\{j \\mid y_j=0\\}$ be the set for negative instances. Let their respective sizes be $N_P = |P|$ and $N_N = |N|$. The ROC-AUC is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{ROC-AUC} = \\frac{1}{N_P N_N} \\sum_{i \\in P} \\sum_{j \\in N} \\mathbb{I}(s_i, s_j) $$\nwhere the comparison function $\\mathbb{I}(s_i, s_j)$ accounts for ties:\n$$ \\mathbb{I}(s_i, s_j) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } s_i > s_j \\\\ 0.5 & \\text{if } s_i = s_j \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } s_i < s_j \\end{cases} $$\nIf either $N_P=0$ or $N_N=0$, there are no pairs to compare, and the ROC-AUC is conventionally defined as $0.5$.

The problem statement assumes such an equilibrium exists. The two potential solutions are $X = \\frac{a \\pm \\sqrt{a^2-4K^2}}{2}$. We will proceed with $X$ satisfying the quadratic relation, as this is sufficient for the derivation.\n\nFor $i \\in \\{2, 3, 4\\}$, at the point $(X, 0, 0, 0)$, we have $x_i = 0$.\n$$ \\frac{dx_i}{dt} = -0 + a\\,\\frac{0^2}{K^2 + 0^2} - b\\,(0)\\,(X + 0 + \\dots) = 0 $$\nThis is satisfied, confirming that $(X, 0, 0, 0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n\nNext, we compute the Jacobian matrix $J$ with elements $J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j}$. The partial derivatives are:\nFor $i=j$:\n$$ J_{ii} = \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_i} = -1 + a\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\left(\\frac{x_i^2}{K^2 + x_i^2}\\right) - b\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\left(x_i \\sum_{k \\neq i}x_k\\right) = -1 + a\\,\\frac{2 K^2 x_i}{(K^2+x_i^2)^2} - b \\sum_{k \\neq i}x_k $$\nFor $i \\neq j$:\n$$ J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j} = -b\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j}\\left(x_i \\sum_{k \\neq i}x_k\\right) = -b x_i $$\nNow, we evaluate these elements at the equilibrium point $(X, 0, 0, 0)$:\n\nElement $J_{11}$:\n$$ J_{11} = -1 + \\frac{2 a K^2 X}{(K^2+X^2)^2} - b(0+0+0) = -1 + \\frac{2 a K^2 X}{(K^2+X^2)^2} $$\nUsing the equilibrium condition $K^2+X^2=aX$, we can simplify $J_{11}$:\n$$ J_{11} = -1 + \\frac{2 a K^2 X}{(aX)^2} = -1 + \\frac{2 K^2}{aX} $$\n\nElements $J_{1j}$ for $j \\in \\{2, 3, 4\\}$:\n$$ J_{1j} = -b x_1 \\Big|_{(X,0,0,0)} = -bX $$\n\nElements $J_{i1}$ for $i \\in \\{2, 3, 4\\}$:\n$$ J_{i1} = -b x_i \\Big|_{(X,0,0,0)} = -b(0) = 0 $$\n\nElements $J_{ii}$ for $i \\in \\{2, 3, 4\\}$:\nFor $i=2$, $x_2=0$ and $\\sum_{k \\neq 2} x_k = X+0+0 = X$.\n$$ J_{22} = -1 + \\frac{2 a K^2 (0)}{(K^2+0)^2} - b(X) = -1 - bX $$\nBy symmetry, $J_{33} = J_{44} = -1 - bX$.\n\nElements $J_{ij}$ for $i,j \\in \\{2, 3, 4\\}$ and $i \\neq j$:\n$$ J_{ij} = -b x_i \\Big|_{(X,0,0,0)} = -b(0) = 0 $$\nThe resulting Jacobian matrix at $(X, 0, 0, 0)$ is:\n$$ J = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 + \\frac{2K^2}{aX} & -bX & -bX & -bX \\\\\n0 & -1-bX & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -1-bX & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -1-bX\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis is an upper triangular matrix, so its eigenvalues are its diagonal entries:\n$$ \\lambda_1 = -1 +  \\frac{2K^2}{aX} $$\n$$ \\lambda_{2,3,4} = -1-bX $$\nThe problem describes the equilibrium as an \"attractor,\" which implies it is stable. For stability, all eigenvalues must have a negative real part. The problem further asks for the largest eigenvalue, which must be less than zero.\nSince $b>0$ and $X>0$, the eigenvalue $\\lambda_{2,3,4} = -1-bX$ is always negative and less than $-1$. This eigenvalue governs the stability in the directions orthogonal to the $x_1$ axis, ensuring that small perturbations in $x_2, x_3, x_4$ decay to zero.\n\nFor $\\lambda_1$, we must eliminate $X$. The solution to $X^2 - aX + K^2 = 0$ that corresponds to a stable high-expression state in such models is the larger root, $X = \\frac{a + \\sqrt{a^2 - 4K^2}}{2}$.\nLet's express $\\frac{1}{X}$ in terms of $a$ and $K$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{X} = \\frac{2}{a + \\sqrt{a^2 - 4K^2}} = \\frac{2(a - \\sqrt{a^2 - 4K^2})}{(a + \\sqrt{a^2 - 4K^2})(a - \\sqrt{a^2 - 4K^2})} = \\frac{2(a - \\sqrt{a^2 - 4K^2})}{a^2 - (a^2-4K^2)} = \\frac{a - \\sqrt{a^2 - 4K^2}}{2K^2} $$\nSubstitute this into the expression for $\\lambda_1$:\n$$ \\lambda_1 = -1 + \\frac{2K^2}{a} \\left(\\frac{1}{X}\\right) = -1 + \\frac{2K^2}{a} \\left(\\frac{a - \\sqrt{a^2-4K^2}}{2K^2}\\right) $$\n$$ \\lambda_1 = -1 + \\frac{a - \\sqrt{a^2-4K^2}}{a} = -1 + 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2-4K^2}}{a} = -\\frac{\\sqrt{a^2-4K^2}}{a} $$\nFor this eigenvalue to correspond to a stable state, we require $\\lambda_1 < 0$. Since $a>2K$, we have $a^2-4K^2>0$, so $\\sqrt{a^2-4K^2}$ is real and positive. Since $a>0$, $\\lambda_1$ is indeed negative.\n\nWe now find the largest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\max}$, by comparing $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_{2,3,4}$.\nWe have $\\lambda_{2,3,4} < -1$.\nFor $\\lambda_1 = -\\frac{\\sqrt{a^2-4K^2}}{a}$, since $a>2K$, we have $0 < \\sqrt{a^2-4K^2} < \\sqrt{a^2} = a$.\nTherefore, $0 < \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2-4K^2}}{a} < 1$, which implies $-1 < \\lambda_1 < 0$.\nComparing the two eigenvalues, we have $\\lambda_{2,3,4} < -1 < \\lambda_1 < 0$.\nThus, the largest eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1$.\n\nThe final expression for the largest real-part eigenvalue is:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\max}(a, K) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 - 4K^2}}{a} $$\nThis eigenvalue dictates the rate of relaxation towards the stable steady state along the principal eigenvector, which is primarily aligned with the $x_1$ axis.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 - 4K^2}}{a}}\n$$", "id": "2847310"}]}
