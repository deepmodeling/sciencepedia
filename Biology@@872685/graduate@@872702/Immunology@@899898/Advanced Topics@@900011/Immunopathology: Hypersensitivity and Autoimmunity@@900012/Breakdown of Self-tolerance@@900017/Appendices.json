In a simplified two-dimensional binding model at the cell-cell interface, treat all species as surface densities.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained; it provides all necessary constants, densities, and a crucial simplifying assumption (the ligand-limited regime) required to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The terminology is precise and the data are physically consistent. Therefore, we proceed to the solution.\n\nThe solution is derived from first principles as demanded. The system consists of two competing reversible binding reactions at equilibrium:\n1. B7 ligand binding to CD28 receptor: $\\text{B7} + \\text{CD28} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{B7--CD28}$\n2. B7 ligand binding to CTLA-4 receptor: $\\text{B7} + \\text{CTLA-4} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{B7--CTLA-4}$\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the equilibrium state for each reaction is described by its two-dimensional dissociation constant, $K_d$.\n\nFor the B7-CD28 interaction, the concentration of complexes, denoted $C_{\\mathrm{CD28}}$, is given by:\n$$K_{d,\\mathrm{CD28}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{CD28,free}} L_{\\mathrm{B7,free}}}{C_{\\mathrm{CD28}}}$$\nRearranging for the complex density yields:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{CD28}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{CD28,free}} L_{\\mathrm{B7,free}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{CD28}}}$$\n\nSimilarly, for the B7-CTLA-4 interaction, the concentration of complexes, $C_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}$, is:\n$$K_{d,\\mathrm{CTLA4}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4,free}} L_{\\mathrm{B7,free}}}{C_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}}$$\nRearranging gives:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4,free}} L_{\\mathrm{B7,free}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{CTLA4}}}$$\n\nThe problem states that the system is in a ligand-limited regime where the total ligand density is low. This justifies the approximation that the amount of bound receptor is negligible compared to the total amount of receptor. Thus, the free receptor density is approximately equal to the total receptor density for both species:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{CD28,free}} \\approx R_{\\mathrm{CD28,total}} = R_{\\mathrm{CD28}}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4,free}} \\approx R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4,total}} = R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}$$\n\nSubstituting this approximation into the expressions for the complex densities:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{CD28}} \\approx \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{CD28}} L_{\\mathrm{B7,free}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{CD28}}}$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}} \\approx \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}} L_{\\mathrm{B7,free}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{CTLA4}}}$$\n\nThe objective is to find the fraction of bound B7 that is complexed with CTLA-4, which is defined as:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}}{C_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}} + C_{\\mathrm{CD28}}}$$\nWe substitute the derived expressions for $C_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{CD28}}$ into this fractional form:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}} = \\frac{\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}} L_{\\mathrm{B7,free}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{CTLA4}}}}{\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}} L_{\\mathrm{B7,free}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{CTLA4}}} + \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{CD28}} L_{\\mathrm{B7,free}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{CD28}}}}$$\nThe term for the free ligand density, $L_{\\mathrm{B7,free}}$, is a common factor in the numerator and the denominator, and thus cancels out:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}} = \\frac{\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{CTLA4}}}}{\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{CTLA4}}} + \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{CD28}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{CD28}}}}$$\nThis is the required analytical expression derived from first principles.

This exercise asks you to reason from first principles to construct the molecular cascade that establishes and stabilizes this anergic state. By connecting initial signaling events to the resulting transcriptional program, you will understand how the cell actively builds a long-lasting barrier to subsequent activation, demonstrating a powerful cell-intrinsic mechanism for maintaining self-tolerance [@problem_id:2837758].", "problem": "A naïve CD4$^+$ T cell encounters peptide–major histocompatibility complex on an antigen-presenting cell that lacks B7 ligands, so the T cell receives T cell receptor (TCR) signaling without CD28 co-stimulation. You are asked to reason, from first principles, how this input pattern drives and stabilizes an anergic state through altered transcriptional programs. Use only the following foundational facts as your starting points, and do not assume any unstated mechanisms.\n\nFoundational facts:\n- Productive T cell activation requires concurrent signals via the TCR and co-stimulatory receptors such as CD28. TCR engagement elevates intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ and activates calcineurin, which dephosphorylates Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT), enabling its nuclear entry. Co-stimulation via CD28 augments phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and protein kinase C theta ($PKC\\theta$), promotes diacylglycerol (DAG)-Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and enhances Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells ($NF-\\kappa B$) and Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) activity.\n- NFAT cooperates with AP-1 to drive productive effector transcription, including interleukin-2 (IL-2). In the relative absence of AP-1, nuclear NFAT can drive a distinct transcriptional program associated with anergy, including upregulation of early growth response genes and negative regulators.\n- The phosphorylation state of signaling proteins reflects a balance between kinases (for example, Lck, ZAP-70, extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and phosphatases (for example, SHP-1, protein phosphatase 2A, PTEN, calcineurin). This balance controls signal amplitude and duration.\n- Ubiquitin E3 ligases catalyze substrate-specific ubiquitination to limit signaling by promoting degradation or functional inactivation of signaling proteins. Lipid kinases such as diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) metabolize second messengers (for example, conversion of DAG to phosphatidic acid), thereby tuning pathway flux.\n\nExperimental observations in this setting:\n- Upon TCR stimulation without CD28, NFAT shows sustained nuclear localization, c-Fos/c-Jun (AP-1) induction is weak, and NF-$\\kappa$B activation is diminished.\n- Transcripts encoding Egr2/Egr3 and proteins such as Cbl-b, Itch, GRAIL (also known as RNF128), and $DGK\\alpha$ increase. On subsequent restimulation, the cell fails to produce IL-2 despite restored antigen and co-stimulation.\n\nWhich option best explains, as a mechanistic chain grounded in the kinase–phosphatase balance and the role of E3 ligases, how TCR signaling in the absence of CD28 co-stimulation stabilizes an anergic state through altered transcriptional programs?\n\nA. The absence of CD28 reduces PI3K/Akt and $PKC\\theta$ inputs, leaving glycogen synthase kinase-3 relatively active and Ras/MAPK signaling weak. Calcineurin still drives NFAT nuclear entry, but with limited AP-1 the nuclear NFAT monomers preferentially induce an anergy-associated transcriptional program (for example, Egr2/Egr3, Cbl-b, Itch, GRAIL, $DGK\\alpha$). The resulting E3 ligases ubiquitinate key signaling intermediates and $DGK\\alpha$ depletes DAG, further dampening Ras/ERK and $PKC\\theta$ on subsequent encounters. This self-reinforcing reduction in kinase activity relative to phosphatase activity stabilizes hyporesponsiveness and suppresses IL-2.\n\nB. The absence of CD28 increases $PKC\\theta$ recruitment, enhancing $NF-\\kappa B$ and AP-1, which directly repress anergy genes while transiently increasing IL-2; anergy ensues secondarily from IL-2 consumption by regulatory T cells.\n\nC. The absence of CD28 hyperactivates ZAP-70 and calcium influx, generating abundant NFAT:AP-1 heterodimers that selectively repress E3 ligase genes; anergy is stabilized because the MAPK pathway becomes desensitized by excessive activation.\n\nD. The absence of CD28 triggers SHP-1 and PTEN to permanently dephosphorylate TCR components, irreversibly fixing anergy independent of transcriptional changes, with no contribution from ubiquitin E3 ligases or second messenger metabolism.\n\nE. Calcineurin remains inactive without CD28, preventing NFAT nuclear import; the resulting global transcriptional silence is sufficient to induce and stabilize anergy without changes in ubiquitination or lipid signaling.\n\nSelect the single best option.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before any attempt at a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n**Initial Conditions:**\n- A naïve $CD4^+$ T cell encounters a peptide–major histocompatibility complex (MHC).\n- The antigen-presenting cell (APC) lacks B7 ligands.\n- The T cell receives T cell receptor (TCR) signaling without CD28 co-stimulation.\n\n**Foundational Facts:**\n1.  Productive T cell activation requires concurrent signals from the TCR (Signal 1) and co-stimulatory receptors like CD28 (Signal 2).\n2.  TCR engagement elevates intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ and activates calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT), facilitating its nuclear entry.\n3.  CD28 co-stimulation augments phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and protein kinase C theta ($PKC\\theta$) signaling, promotes diacylglycerol (DAG)-Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, and enhances Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells ($NF-\\kappa B$) and Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) activity.\n4.  NFAT cooperates with AP-1 to drive productive transcription, such as for interleukin-2 (IL-2).\n5.  In the relative absence of AP-1, nuclear NFAT drives a distinct anergy-associated transcriptional program, upregulating early growth response genes and negative regulators.\n6.  The phosphorylation state of signaling proteins is determined by a balance between kinases (e.g., Lck, ZAP-70, extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and phosphatases (e.g., SHP-1, protein phosphatase 2A, PTEN, calcineurin).\n7.  Ubiquitin E3 ligases catalyze substrate-specific ubiquitination, leading to degradation or functional inactivation of signaling proteins.\n8.  Lipid kinases like diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) metabolize second messengers (e.g., converting DAG to phosphatidic acid) to tune signaling pathway flux.\n\n**Experimental Observations:**\n1.  Upon TCR stimulation without CD28 co-stimulation:\n    - NFAT shows sustained nuclear localization.\n    - Induction of c-Fos/c-Jun (components of AP-1) is weak.\n    - $NF-\\kappa B$ activation is diminished.\n2.  Transcripts encoding Egr2/Egr3, Cbl-b, Itch, GRAIL (RNF128), and $DGK\\alpha$ are increased.\n3.  Upon subsequent restimulation with both antigen and co-stimulation, the cell fails to produce IL-2. This is the definition of the anergic state.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem asks for a mechanistic explanation for the stabilization of T cell anergy based on the provided facts and observations.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on central and well-established principles of T-lymphocyte immunology, specifically the two-signal model of activation and the molecular basis of anergy. All molecules (e.g., NFAT, AP-1, Cbl-b) and pathways (e.g., PI3K/Akt, MAPK) are correctly placed within the context of T cell signaling. The described phenomena are factually sound and represent a standard model taught in immunology.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a set of initial conditions, fundamental principles, and experimental observations, and asks to construct a causal chain that connects them. The question seeks the \"best\" explanation among a set of options, which is a standard format for evaluating conceptual understanding. A unique, logical solution can be derived from the provided information.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical and precise. It is free of ambiguity, subjectivity, or non-scientific claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The \"Foundational Facts\" and \"Experimental Observations\" are self-consistent and sufficient to build the required mechanistic model. For instance, the fact that NFAT without AP-1 drives an anergy program is perfectly consistent with the observation that AP-1 is weak while anergy-associated genes are upregulated.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe task is to construct a mechanistic chain explaining the induction and stabilization of an anergic state based on the provided information.\n\n1.  **Initiation:** The T cell receives Signal 1 (TCR engagement) without Signal 2 (CD28 co-stimulation).\n2.  **Signal Transduction:**\n    - Per the foundational facts, TCR engagement triggers a $Ca^{2+}$ flux, which activates the phosphatase calcineurin.\n    - Calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT, causing its translocation into the nucleus. This is confirmed by the experimental observation of sustained NFAT nuclear localization.\n    - The absence of CD28 signaling means the pathways it normally augments are weak. This includes PI3K/Akt, $PKC\\theta$, and Ras/MAPK. The weakness of these pathways leads to diminished activation of the transcription factors AP-1 and $NF-\\kappa B$, as confirmed by experimental observations.\n3.  **Altered Transcription:**\n    - In the nucleus, NFAT is present, but its cooperative partner for productive activation, AP-1, is not.\n    - The foundational facts state that in the absence of sufficient AP-1, nuclear NFAT initiates an anergy-associated transcriptional program.\n    - The experimental observations confirm this by showing an increase in transcripts for Egr2/Egr3 and for several negative regulatory proteins: the E3 ubiquitin ligases Cbl-b, Itch, and GRAIL, and the lipid kinase $DGK\\alpha$.\n4.  **Stabilization of Anergy:** The key to stabilization lies in the function of these newly synthesized negative regulators.\n    - The E3 ligases (Cbl-b, Itch, GRAIL) will, as per the foundational facts, target key positive signaling molecules for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation or inactivation. This structurally dismantles the TCR signaling cascade.\n    - The lipid kinase $DGK\\alpha$ will metabolize the second messenger DAG into phosphatidic acid. DAG is essential for activating $PKC\\theta$ and the Ras/MAPK pathway. By depleting DAG, $DGK\\alpha$ functionally cripples these pathways.\n    - Together, these actions create a robust negative feedback loop. The initial signaling imbalance leads to the production of molecules that further suppress signaling. This ensures that even upon subsequent, complete stimulation (with both Signal 1 and Signal 2), the cell is unable to mount a productive response (i.e., produce IL-2). The cellular signaling machinery is now biased towards inactivation; the balance between kinases and phosphatases is shifted profoundly towards the latter, either by removal of kinases or by the dominance of constitutively active phosphatases. This constitutes a stable, hyporesponsive anergic state.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The absence of CD28 reduces PI3K/Akt and $PKC\\theta$ inputs, leaving glycogen synthase kinase-3 relatively active and Ras/MAPK signaling weak. Calcineurin still drives NFAT nuclear entry, but with limited AP-1 the nuclear NFAT monomers preferentially induce an anergy-associated transcriptional program (for example, Egr2/Egr3, Cbl-b, Itch, GRAIL, $DGK\\alpha$). The resulting E3 ligases ubiquitinate key signaling intermediates and $DGK\\alpha$ depletes DAG, further dampening Ras/ERK and $PKC\\theta$ on subsequent encounters. This self-reinforcing reduction in kinase activity relative to phosphatase activity stabilizes hyporesponsiveness and suppresses IL-2.**\n- This option correctly follows the logical chain derived from first principles. It accurately describes the consequences of absent CD28 signaling (reduced PI3K/Akt, weak Ras/MAPK), the resulting transcriptional switch by NFAT in the absence of AP-1, and the subsequent stabilization of anergy through the actions of the upregulated E3 ligases and $DGK\\alpha$. The mention of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a correct detail, as its inhibition is a downstream effect of the PI3K/Akt pathway, but the core argument of the option stands even without this detail. The option correctly synthesizes all provided facts and observations into a coherent mechanism.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The absence of CD28 increases $PKC\\theta$ recruitment, enhancing $NF-\\kappa B$ and AP-1, which directly repress anergy genes while transiently increasing IL-2; anergy ensues secondarily from IL-2 consumption by regulatory T cells.**\n- This option makes several claims that directly contradict the provided information. The problem states that absence of CD28 diminishes $NF-\\kappa B$ and AP-1 activity, and that CD28 augments $PKC\\theta$. The option claims the opposite. Furthermore, it posits an extrinsic mechanism of tolerance (Treg-mediated IL-2 consumption) when the problem is clearly describing a cell-intrinsic mechanism of anergy established through transcriptional reprogramming.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The absence of CD28 hyperactivates ZAP-70 and calcium influx, generating abundant NFAT:AP-1 heterodimers that selectively repress E3 ligase genes; anergy is stabilized because the MAPK pathway becomes desensitized by excessive activation.**\n- This option is incorrect on multiple points. There is no basis in the provided text to assume *hyperactivation* of ZAP-70 or calcium. It incorrectly claims the generation of *abundant* NFAT:AP-1 heterodimers, whereas the experimental data show AP-1 induction is *weak*. It claims that E3 ligase genes are repressed, directly contradicting the experimental observation that their transcripts *increase*.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The absence of CD28 triggers SHP-1 and PTEN to permanently dephosphorylate TCR components, irreversibly fixing anergy independent of transcriptional changes, with no contribution from ubiquitin E3 ligases or second messenger metabolism.**\n- This option explicitly excludes the central mechanism described in the problem. The question specifically asks to explain stabilization \"through altered transcriptional programs\". This option claims the mechanism is \"independent of transcriptional changes.\" It also denies the contribution of ubiquitin E3 ligases, which is contrary to the experimental observation that their transcripts are upregulated.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Calcineurin remains inactive without CD28, preventing NFAT nuclear import; the resulting global transcriptional silence is sufficient to induce and stabilize anergy without changes in ubiquitination or lipid signaling.**\n- This option is fundamentally flawed. The foundational facts state that TCR engagement, not CD28 signaling, activates calcineurin. The experimental observations confirm that NFAT shows \"sustained nuclear localization,\" which directly proves that calcineurin is active and NFAT has entered the nucleus. This option's premise is false. Additionally, there is no \"global transcriptional silence\"; rather, a specific anergic program is activated.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2837758"}, {"introduction": "While cellular control mechanisms are robust, they can be overwhelmed by strong inflammatory events, potentially leading to a permanent breakdown of self-tolerance.

A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe solution is approached in two sequential parts: analyzing the system during the infection interval and then analyzing it post-infection to determine the threshold for irreversible growth.\n\n**Part 1: Clonal Dynamics During Infection ($0 \\le t < \\tau$)**\nDuring the infection, the clone size $N(t)$ is governed by the linear ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\left(\\gamma C_{\\mathrm{i}} - \\delta\\right) N(t)\n$$\nLet the net growth rate during infection be denoted by the constant $r_{1} = \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{i}} - \\delta$. The problem specifies that $r_{1} > 0$, indicating exponential growth. The equation is $\\frac{dN}{dt} = r_{1} N$.\nIntegrating this equation from the initial condition $N(0) = N_{0}$ gives the solution for $t \\in [0, \\tau)$:\n$$\nN(t) = N_{0} \\exp(r_{1} t)\n$$\nThe size of the clone at the moment the infection ends, $t=\\tau$, is therefore:\n$$\nN(\\tau) = N_{0} \\exp(r_{1} \\tau)\n$$\nThis value, $N(\\tau)$, serves as the initial condition for the second phase of the dynamics.\n\n**Part 2: Clonal Dynamics Post-Infection ($t \\ge \\tau$)**\nAfter the infection resolves, the dynamics are described by the nonlinear ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\left(\\gamma\\left(C_{\\mathrm{b}} + \\eta N\\right) - \\delta\\right) N = (\\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}} - \\delta + \\gamma \\eta N) N\n$$\nTo understand the long-term behavior of the system, we must find its fixed points by setting $\\frac{dN}{dt} = 0$:\n$$\n(\\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}} - \\delta + \\gamma \\eta N) N = 0\n$$\nThis equation yields two fixed points:\n$1.$ The trivial fixed point, $N^{*}_{1} = 0$, which corresponds to the extinction of the clone (the \"tolerant\" state).\n$2.$ The non-trivial fixed point, $N^{*}_{2}$, obtained by solving $\\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}} - \\delta + \\gamma \\eta N = 0$:\n$$\nN^{*}_{2} = -\\frac{\\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}} - \\delta}{\\gamma \\eta} = \\frac{\\delta - \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}}}{\\gamma \\eta}\n$$\nLet us name this threshold $N_{\\mathrm{crit}} = N^{*}_{2}$. Given the problem constraints $\\delta - \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}} > 0$, $\\gamma > 0$, and $\\eta > 0$, this fixed point is positive, $N_{\\mathrm{crit}} > 0$.\n\nNext, we determine the stability of these fixed points. Let $f(N) = (\\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}} - \\delta + \\gamma \\eta N) N$. Stability is determined by the sign of the derivative $f'(N) = \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}} - \\delta + 2\\gamma \\eta N$ at each fixed point.\n-   At $N^{*}_{1} = 0$, the derivative is $f'(0) = \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}} - \\delta$. By a given constraint, this is negative. Therefore, $N=0$ is a stable fixed point (an attractor).\n-   At $N^{*}_{2} = N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, the derivative is $f'(N_{\\mathrm{crit}}) = (\\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}} - \\delta) + 2\\gamma \\eta \\left(\\frac{\\delta - \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}}}{\\gamma \\eta}\\right) = (\\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}} - \\delta) + 2(\\delta - \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}}) = \\delta - \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}}$. By constraint, this is positive. Therefore, $N=N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ is an unstable fixed point (a repeller).\n\nThe unstable fixed point $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ acts as a separatrix. If the population size at the start of the post-infection phase, $N(\\tau)$, is below this threshold, the clone will contract to extinction ($N \\to 0$). If $N(\\tau)$ is above this threshold, the clone will grow unchecked. This latter case is the \"irreversible expansion\".\n\n**Derivation of the Minimal Infection Duration $\\tau_{\\min}$**\nIrreversible expansion is triggered if $N(\\tau) > N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. The minimal duration $\\tau_{\\min}$ is the time required for the clone to grow such that its size at the end of the infection period exactly reaches the critical threshold:\n$$\nN(\\tau_{\\min}) = N_{\\mathrm{crit}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $N(\\tau_{\\min})$ from Part 1 and $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ from Part 2:\n$$\nN_{0} \\exp\\left((\\gamma C_{\\mathrm{i}} - \\delta) \\tau_{\\min}\\right) = \\frac{\\delta - \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}}}{\\gamma \\eta}\n$$\nWe now solve for $\\tau_{\\min}$. First, isolate the exponential term:\n$$\n\\exp\\left((\\gamma C_{\\mathrm{i}} - \\delta) \\tau_{\\min}\\right) = \\frac{\\delta - \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}}}{N_{0} \\gamma \\eta}\n$$\nThe problem states that $N_0$ is below the threshold, meaning $N_0 < N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. This guarantees that the argument of the logarithm to be taken is greater than $1$, ensuring $\\tau_{\\min} > 0$.\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n(\\gamma C_{\\mathrm{i}} - \\delta) \\tau_{\\min} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\delta - \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}}}{N_{0} \\gamma \\eta}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, dividing by the net growth rate during infection yields the expression for the minimal duration:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma C_{\\mathrm{i}} - \\delta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\delta - \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}}}{N_{0} \\gamma \\eta}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the minimum infection duration required to push the autoreactive clone past the point of no return, into a state of self-sustained, irreversible expansion.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\gamma C_{\\mathrm{i}} - \\delta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\delta - \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{b}}}{N_{0} \\gamma \\eta}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2837775"}]}
