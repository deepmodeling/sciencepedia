This exercise challenges you to connect standard laboratory assays—from microscopic visualization of the core complex to biochemical measures of enzyme activity and cell death—to the precise sequence of events in the canonical NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) pathway. By interpreting how specific inhibitors dissect this pathway, you will develop a critical skill for designing and analyzing inflammasome experiments [@problem_id:2862054].", "problem": "A researcher investigates canonical inflammasome activation in mouse bone marrow–derived macrophages. Cells are primed with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce transcription of pro-interleukin precursors and the sensor platform, and then stimulated with nigericin, a potassium ionophore, to trigger assembly of the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain–containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. The researcher measures four standard readouts: apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) (ASC) speck formation by microscopy, Fluorochrome-Labeled Inhibitor of Caspases (FLICA) caspase-1 activity in live cells, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for secreted IL-1β and IL-18, and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) release as an index of membrane integrity loss.\n\nFoundational facts and definitions for this system include: the canonical inflammasome is an oligomeric signaling platform that forms upon sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), leading to ASC oligomerization, recruitment and autoproteolysis of pro-caspase-1 to active caspase-1, proteolytic maturation of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, and cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD) to form membrane pores that mediate pyroptotic lysis and cytokine release. ELISA detects extracellular protein concentration, FLICA probes bind the active-site cysteine of caspases, ASC “specks” are cytosolic puncta reflecting ASC polymerization, and LDH is a cytosolic enzyme whose appearance in the supernatant indicates loss of plasma membrane integrity regardless of cause.\n\nAfter LPS priming and nigericin stimulation, the following observations are made relative to unstimulated controls: ASC specks are observed in approximately $70\\%$ of cells; FLICA positivity for caspase-1 is markedly increased; IL-1β and IL-18 in the supernatant rise to approximately $1.5\\times 10^{3}$ pg/mL and $8.0\\times 10^{2}$ pg/mL, respectively; and LDH release reaches approximately $45\\%$ of maximal lysis. Addition of a selective caspase-1 inhibitor (e.g., VX-765, $20\\,\\mu\\text{M}$) before nigericin does not change ASC speck frequency, abolishes the FLICA caspase-1 signal, reduces IL-1β/IL-18 to near baseline (approximately $<10^{2}$ pg/mL), and decreases LDH release to approximately $10\\%$. By contrast, addition of a gasdermin D pore inhibitor (e.g., disulfiram, $20\\,\\mu\\text{M}$) does not alter ASC specks or FLICA caspase-1 activity, but markedly lowers IL-1β/IL-18 release (to approximately $10^{2}$–$2\\times 10^{2}$ pg/mL) and decreases LDH to approximately $15\\%$.\n\nBased on the foundational definitions above and the inhibitor response profile, which option best defines what each assay primarily reports in the inflammasome pathway and correctly interprets the inhibitor data?\n\nA. ASC speck imaging reports cytolytic death downstream of pore formation; FLICA indicates the cellular abundance of pro-caspase-1; IL-1β/IL-18 ELISA primarily reflects transcriptional priming; LDH release is a specific marker of inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis. The caspase-1 inhibitor reduces FLICA by downregulating procaspase expression, while the gasdermin D inhibitor reduces ASC specks by blocking assembly.\n\nB. ASC speck imaging reports ASC oligomerization and inflammasome assembly upstream of caspase-1 activation; FLICA reports active caspase-1 enzyme in live cells; IL-1β/IL-18 ELISA reports processed cytokines in the extracellular space, which depend on caspase-1 activity and gasdermin D pores for efficient release; LDH release reports loss of membrane integrity regardless of cause. The caspase-1 inhibitor is expected to leave ASC specks unchanged, abolish FLICA signal, sharply reduce cytokines, and diminish LDH; the gasdermin D inhibitor is expected to leave ASC specks and FLICA unchanged, reduce cytokines, and diminish LDH.\n\nC. ASC speck imaging reports mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation; FLICA records apoptotic caspase-3/7 activity; IL-1β/IL-18 ELISA indicates intracellular stores of pro-cytokines; LDH release reports endoplasmic reticulum stress. The caspase-1 inhibitor increases FLICA by feedback, while the gasdermin D inhibitor increases IL-1β release by preventing cell death.\n\nD. ASC speck imaging reports nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) transcriptional activation; FLICA measures the fraction of cells with inactive zymogen caspase-1; IL-1β/IL-18 ELISA directly reflects mRNA levels; LDH release is sufficient to diagnose inflammasome activation. The caspase-1 inhibitor should increase LDH by blocking cytokine secretion, and gasdermin D inhibition should elevate FLICA by trapping active caspase-1.\n\nE. ASC speck imaging and FLICA both report late membrane rupture; IL-1β/IL-18 ELISA is independent of caspase-1 and gasdermin D; LDH release specifically reports apoptosis. The caspase-1 inhibitor should not alter cytokines, and the gasdermin D inhibitor should not alter LDH.", "solution": "The problem will be validated before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n**Experimental Setup:**\n-   Cells: Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages.\n-   Priming Agent (Signal $1$): Lipopolysaccharide (LPS).\n-   Stimulating Agent (Signal $2$): Nigericin, a potassium ionophore.\n-   Inflammasome studied: NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein $3$ (NLRP3) inflammasome.\n\n**Assays (Readouts):**\n1.

The canonical NLRP3 inflammasome pathway described (LPS priming, K$^{+}$ efflux stimulus, ASC oligomerization, caspase-$1$ activation, cytokine processing, and GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis) is a textbook model of this innate immune response. The assays (ASC microscopy, FLICA, ELISA, LDH) are standard, and their definitions are correct. The inhibitors (VX-$765$ for caspase-$1$, disulfiram for GSDMD) and their described effects are consistent with published literature. The numerical data are plausible for such an experiment.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary definitions, pathway information, and experimental data required to evaluate the options. The question is precise, asking to map assays to pathway steps and interpret inhibitor data. A unique, logical solution can be derived.\n-   **Objective:** The language is scientific, precise, and free of bias or subjective claims.\n\nThe problem statement does not violate any criteria for invalidity. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and formalizable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a systematic interpretation of a well-defined biological signaling pathway using experimental data. The core of the task is to correctly place each measurement (assay) within the sequence of events and understand how specific inhibitors dissect this pathway.\n\n**1. Reconstruct the Signaling Pathway:**\nBased on the provided foundational facts, the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome pathway proceeds in a specific order:\n1.  **Priming (Signal $1$)**: LPS priming induces the expression of inflammasome components like NLRP3 and substrates like pro-IL-$1\\beta$ and pro-IL-$18$.\n2.  **Activation (Signal $2$)**: Nigericin causes potassium ($K^{+}$) efflux, which triggers the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n3.  **Inflammasome Assembly**: NLRP3 oligomerizes and recruits the adaptor protein ASC. ASC then itself polymerizes into a large signaling hub, which is visible by microscopy as an \"ASC speck\".\n4.  **Caspase-$1$ Activation**: Pro-caspase-$1$ is recruited to the ASC speck and undergoes proximity-induced auto-cleavage, generating the active enzyme caspase-$1$.\n5.  **Effector Functions**: Active caspase-$1$ has two main substrates here:\n    a.  It cleaves pro-IL-$1\\beta$ and pro-IL-$18$ into their mature, active forms.\n    b.  It cleaves GSDMD. The N-terminal fragment of GSDMD oligomerizes and inserts into the plasma membrane, forming pores.\n6.  **Cellular Outcomes**: The GSDMD pores lead to two terminal events:\n    a.  **Pyroptosis**: A lytic form of cell death, causing loss of membrane integrity and release of cytosolic contents, including the enzyme LDH.\n    b.  **Cytokine Release**: Mature IL-$1\\beta$ and IL-$18$ are efficiently released from the cell through the GSDMD pores.\n\n**2. Map Assays to Pathway Events:**\n-   **ASC speck imaging**: The definition states these are \"puncta reflecting ASC polymerization\". This assay directly measures Step $3$, the assembly of the core inflammasome platform, which is upstream of all subsequent enzymatic activity.\n-   **FLICA caspase-$1$ activity**: The definition states FLICA \"probes bind the active-site cysteine of caspases\". This assay, therefore, specifically measures active caspase-$1$, corresponding to Step $4$. It does not measure the inactive pro-caspase-$1$ zymogen.\n-   **IL-$1\\beta$/IL-$18$ ELISA**: ELISA measures \"extracellular protein concentration\". This assay quantifies the final outcome of the pathway: the amount of mature cytokine that has been both processed (by caspase-$1$, Step $5$a) and released from the cell (via GSDMD pores, Step $6$b).\n-   **LDH release**: This assay measures the release of a \"cytosolic enzyme\", indicating \"loss of plasma membrane integrity\". In this context, it is the primary readout for pyroptotic cell death (Step $6$a), which is a consequence of GSDMD pore formation.\n\n**3. Interpret Inhibitor Data:**\n-   **Caspase-$1$ inhibitor**: This inhibitor should block all events *downstream* of caspase-$1$ activation (Step $4$).\n    -   *Prediction*: Should not affect upstream events like ASC speck formation (Step $3$). Should abolish FLICA signal (as it directly measures active caspase-$1$). Should prevent cytokine maturation and GSDMD cleavage, thus greatly reducing IL-$1\\beta$/IL-$18$ release and LDH release.\n    -   *Observation*: \"does not change ASC speck frequency, abolishes the FLICA caspase-$1$ signal, reduces IL-$1\\beta$/IL-$18$ to near baseline... and decreases LDH release to approximately $10\\%$.\" The observations perfectly match the prediction, confirming that ASC specks are upstream of caspase-$1$ and that cytokine maturation/release and pyroptosis are downstream.\n-   **GSDMD pore inhibitor**: This inhibitor should block the function of GSDMD pores (Step $6$).\n    -   *Prediction*: Should not affect upstream events like ASC speck formation (Step $3$) or caspase-$1$ activation (Step $4$). Should block the main exit route for cytokines and the mechanism of pyroptosis, thus greatly reducing IL-$1\\beta$/IL-$18$ release and LDH release.\n    -   *Observation*: \"does not alter ASC specks or FLICA caspase-$1$ activity, but markedly lowers IL-$1\\beta$/IL-$18$ release... and decreases LDH to approximately $15\\%$.\" The observations perfectly match the prediction, confirming GSDMD pore formation is downstream of caspase-$1$ activation and is the primary mechanism for both cytokine release and lytic cell death in this system.\n\n**4. Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\n-   **Option A**:\n    -   `ASC speck imaging reports cytolytic death downstream of pore formation`: **Incorrect**. ASC specks are an upstream assembly event.\n    -   `FLICA indicates the cellular abundance of pro-caspase-1`: **Incorrect**. FLICA measures active caspase-$1$.\n    -   `IL-1β/IL-18 ELISA primarily reflects transcriptional priming`: **Incorrect**. It measures secreted protein, a post-translational event.\n    -   `LDH release is a specific marker of inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis`: **Incorrect**. The problem states it measures lysis \"regardless of cause\".\n    -   The interpretation of inhibitor actions is also factually wrong.\n\n-   **Option B**:\n    -   `ASC speck imaging reports ASC oligomerization and inflammasome assembly upstream of caspase-1 activation`: **Correct**. This aligns with the pathway logic and data.\n    -   `FLICA reports active caspase-1 enzyme in live cells`: **Correct**. This is the definition of the assay.\n    -   `IL-1β/IL-18 ELISA reports processed cytokines in the extracellular space, which depend on caspase-1 activity and gasdermin D pores for efficient release`: **Correct**. This accurately describes the two dependencies confirmed by the inhibitor data.\n    -   `LDH release reports loss of membrane integrity regardless of cause`: **Correct**. This is a direct quote of the provided definition.\n    -   The predicted effects of both the caspase-$1$ and gasdermin D inhibitors are also stated correctly and match the experimental observations verbatim.\n\n-   **Option C**:\n    -   This option completely misidentifies the assays. `ASC speck imaging` is not for ROS. The FLICA here is specified for `caspase-1`, not apoptotic `caspase-3/7`. `ELISA` measures extracellular, not intracellular, protein. `LDH` reports plasma membrane rupture, not ER stress. The inhibitor interpretations are contrary to the data. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **Option D**:\n    -   Again, this option misidentifies the assays. `ASC speck imaging` is not `NF-κB` activation (which is priming). `FLICA` is for active, not inactive, caspase. `ELISA` is for protein, not mRNA. `LDH` is a non-specific marker of lysis, not sufficient for diagnosis. The inhibitor interpretations are contrary to the data. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **Option E**:\n    -   This option makes several false claims. `ASC specks` and `FLICA` are upstream of membrane rupture. `ELISA` is clearly dependent on both caspase-$1$ and GSDMD, as shown by the inhibitors. `LDH release` reports pyroptosis in this context, but apoptosis is generally non-lytic. The inhibitor interpretations are explicitly contradicted by the provided data. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption B is the only statement that correctly defines the role of each assay within the inflammasome pathway and provides an accurate interpretation of the inhibitor experimental data, which is fully consistent with the foundational facts provided.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2862054"}, {"introduction": "Inflammasome biology is not a single, monolithic pathway but a network of distinct sensing and execution modules.

By predicting the outcomes of specific stimuli in genetically engineered macrophages, you will learn to reason through complex signaling networks and appreciate the specific roles of key proteins like caspase-4 and NLRP3 [@problem_id:2862065].", "problem": "A research lab generates human monocyte-derived macrophages with a double Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) knockout of caspase-4 and NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3). Cells are first primed with a Toll-like receptor 2 agonist (to induce pro-interleukin-1β and inflammasome components) for $3$ h, washed, and then stimulated under two alternative conditions: (i) cytosolic delivery of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by transfection at $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g/mL}$, or (ii) extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) addition at $5\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ for $30$ min. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in supernatants and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release as a marker of pyroptotic membrane rupture are quantified after $60$ min.\n\nUse only the following foundational facts as the starting point for your reasoning:\n- Canonical inflammasome activation by NLRP3 leads to recruitment and activation of caspase-1, which processes pro-IL-1β into mature IL-1β and cleaves gasdermin D to form membrane pores that cause pyroptosis and LDH release.\n- Noncanonical inflammasome activation in human macrophages occurs when cytosolic LPS binds caspase-4, which cleaves gasdermin D to induce pyroptosis; the resulting ionic fluxes can secondarily activate NLRP3, enabling caspase-1-dependent maturation of IL-1β.\n- Extracellular ATP activates the purinergic P2X7 receptor, causing potassium efflux that directly activates the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n\nBased on these principles, which option best predicts the pattern of IL-1β secretion and LDH release you would observe in the double knockout macrophages after LPS transfection versus ATP addition?\n\nA.

LPS transfection: minimal IL-1β with moderate LDH via caspase-8; ATP addition: moderate IL-1β via caspase-8 with low LDH.", "solution": "Begin from the core definitions and well-established mechanisms:\n\n1. Canonical NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3 senses perturbations such as potassium efflux, recruits the adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), and activates caspase-1. Caspase-1 performs two critical functions: it cleaves pro-interleukin-1β (pro-IL-1β) into mature IL-1β, and it cleaves gasdermin D to generate the N-terminal fragment that forms membrane pores. These pores underlie pyroptosis, which is experimentally read out as LDH release.\n\n2. Noncanonical inflammasome in human macrophages. Cytosolic LPS binds and activates caspase-4 (and caspase-5), which directly cleaves gasdermin D to cause pore formation and pyroptosis. The resulting ionic fluxes, especially potassium efflux, can secondarily activate NLRP3, enabling caspase-1-dependent maturation of IL-1β. Thus, in response to cytosolic LPS, caspase-4 is upstream of gasdermin D–mediated LDH release, and NLRP3 is required for robust caspase-1-dependent IL-1β maturation.\n\n3. ATP stimulation. Extracellular ATP activates the P2X7 receptor, causing potassium efflux that directly engages the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome. In this setting, caspase-1 activation, gasdermin D cleavage, pyroptosis, and IL-1β maturation all depend on NLRP3; caspase-4 is not required for ATP-triggered responses.\n\nNow apply these principles to the double knockout:\n\n- Genotype: caspase-4$^{-/-}$, NLRP3$^{-/-}$ human macrophages.\n\n- LPS transfection (cytosolic LPS):\n  - Without caspase-4, cytosolic LPS cannot initiate noncanonical inflammasome activation. There will be no gasdermin D cleavage via caspase-4, so pyroptotic pore formation is abrogated and LDH release should be minimal.\n  - Without NLRP3, even if any minor upstream signals occurred, the canonical pathway that activates caspase-1 is disabled, so maturation and secretion of IL-1β is expected to be minimal. Priming induces pro-IL-1β, but without caspase-1 (or another active converting protease), mature IL-1β will not be secreted.\n\n- ATP addition:\n  - ATP engages the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome downstream of P2X7-mediated potassium efflux. With NLRP3 deleted, activation of caspase-1 does not occur. Consequently, gasdermin D is not cleaved by caspase-1, so pyroptotic pore formation and LDH release are minimal.\n  - The absence of NLRP3 also prevents caspase-1-dependent processing of pro-IL-1β, so IL-1β secretion remains minimal. Caspase-4 status is irrelevant in this ATP-triggered pathway.\n\nTherefore, in double knockout cells, both cytosolic LPS and ATP fail to produce the two hallmark outputs: mature IL-1β secretion and LDH release.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- Option A: Predicts ATP responses are intact (robust IL-1β and LDH). This contradicts the requirement of NLRP3 for ATP-triggered canonical inflammasome activation; with NLRP3$^{-/-}$, both outputs should be minimal. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- Option B: Predicts high LDH with LPS transfection despite caspase-4 deletion. Cytosolic LPS–induced pyroptosis depends on caspase-4 in human macrophages; without caspase-4, gasdermin D is not cleaved, so LDH should be minimal. ATP predictions (minimal outputs) are correct for NLRP3$^{-/-}$, but the LPS part is wrong. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- Option C: Predicts minimal IL-1β and minimal LDH for both stimuli. This matches the mechanism: LPS transfection cannot signal through caspase-4 (deleted) or activate NLRP3 (deleted), and ATP cannot signal without NLRP3. Verdict: Correct.\n\n- Option D: Suggests robust IL-1β with LPS transfection despite low LDH, and robust LDH with ATP despite low IL-1β. Robust IL-1β secretion requires caspase-1 activation via an inflammasome; with NLRP3 absent and no clear alternate inflammasome engaged by cytosolic LPS in the absence of caspase-4, this is not expected. Likewise, robust LDH with ATP requires gasdermin D cleavage via caspase-1 depending on NLRP3, which is deleted. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- Option E: Proposes caspase-8 as an alternative route yielding moderate outputs. While caspase-8 can participate in certain noncanonical inflammasome or cell death pathways in specific contexts, ATP-triggered NLRP3 activation and cytosolic LPS–triggered caspase-4 activation in human macrophages do not ordinarily reroute to caspase-8 to produce substantial IL-1β and LDH in the combined absence of caspase-4 and NLRP3. Empirically, such double knockout would show near-baseline outputs under these stimuli. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nThus, the best prediction is minimal IL-1β and minimal LDH for both stimuli in the double knockout macrophages.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2862065"}, {"introduction": "Beyond NLRP3, other inflammasomes like NLR family CARD domain-containing protein 4 (NLRC4) provide crucial defense against intracellular bacteria by recognizing specific microbial components.

Since the only available ligand in this experiment is the `T3SS` rod, the relevant sensor for initiating an inflammasome response is `NAIP2`. The sensor `NAIP5` is not expected to be engaged, as its cognate ligand, flagellin, is absent.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Wild-Type Macrophage Response**: In wild-type macrophages, all `NAIP` proteins, including `NAIP2`, are present and functional. Upon infection, the bacterial `T3SS` rod enters the cytosol and is recognized by `NAIP2`. Following the stated principles, this recognition event causes `NAIP2` to nucleate the assembly of the `NLRC4` inflammasome. Downstream of `NLRC4` assembly, `caspase-1` is recruited and activated. Activated `caspase-1` will then cleave `GSDMD` to induce pyroptosis (measured by `LDH` release) and process pro-`IL-1\\beta` (expressed due to `LPS` priming) into mature, secretable `IL-1\\beta` (measured by `ELISA`). Therefore, a robust inflammasome response is expected in wild-type macrophages.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the `NAIP5^{-/-}` Macrophage Response**: The `NAIP5^{-/-}` macrophages lack the `NAIP5` protein. However, as established in step $2$, the `NAIP5` sensor is irrelevant for the specific stimulus used in this experiment. The crucial sensor, `NAIP2`, which detects the `T3SS` rod, is still present and functional in these cells (the knockout is specific to `NAIP5`). Consequently, upon infection, the `T3SS` rod will engage `NAIP2` in the `NAIP5^{-/-}` macrophages, leading to the same cascade of events as in the wild-type cells: `NAIP2`-dependent `NLRC4` inflammasome assembly, `caspase-1` activation, pyroptosis, and `IL-1\\beta` secretion.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The absence of `NAIP5` has no functional consequence in an experiment where its ligand (flagellin) is absent and the active ligand (T`3`SS rod) is sensed by a different protein (`NAIP2`). Therefore, both wild-type and `NAIP5^{-/-}` macrophages are predicted to exhibit a virtually identical, robust inflammasome activation pattern.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Both wild-type and NAIP5$^{-/-}$ macrophages exhibit robust NLRC4-dependent caspase-1 activation, gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis, and interleukin-1β secretion upon cytosolic delivery of the T3SS rod; loss of NAIP5 has no measurable effect in this context.**\n    This statement is in complete agreement with the derivation. The response is `NLRC4`-dependent (nucleated by `NAIP2`), and triggers all downstream readouts. Crucially, it correctly identifies that the loss of `NAIP5` is inconsequential for this specific stimulus. **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. Only wild-type macrophages activate an inflammasome because NAIP5 is required to sense both flagellin and the T3SS rod; NAIP5$^{-/-}$ macrophages are non-responsive.**\n    This statement is factually incorrect according to the provided principles. The principles explicitly assign specificity: `NAIP5` for flagellin and `NAIP2` for the `T3SS` rod. It is false that `NAIP5` senses the `T3SS` rod. Therefore, `NAIP5^{-/-}` macrophages are not non-responsive. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. Neither wild-type nor NAIP5$^{-/-}$ macrophages activate an inflammasome because flagellin is required to trigger NLRC4; the T3SS rod alone is insufficient.**\n    This statement directly contradicts the provided principles, which state that `NAIP2` recognizes the `T3SS` rod and nucleates `NLRC4` inflammasome assembly. The `T3SS` rod is therefore a sufficient stimulus for `NLRC4` activation via `NAIP2`. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. NAIP5$^{-/-}$ macrophages fail to activate NLRC4 but compensate via NLRP3, resulting in delayed yet stronger interleukin-1β secretion than wild-type, with minimal pyroptosis.**\n    This statement contains multiple errors. First, `NAIP5^{-/-}` macrophages do not fail to activate `NLRC4`, as the `NAIP2` pathway is intact. Second, there is no information provided to suggest a compensatory activation of the `NLRP3` inflammasome. Third, the claims of \"stronger\" `IL-1\\beta` secretion and \"minimal\" pyroptosis are speculative and unsupported by the problem's framework. `NLRC4` activation is known to be a potent inducer of pyroptosis. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **E. Wild-type macrophages switch to NLRP3 activation in the absence of flagellin, while NAIP5$^{-/-}$ macrophages are unresponsive because they cannot recruit the adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC).**\n    This statement is fundamentally flawed. Wild-type macrophages do not need to \"switch\" to `NLRP3` because a direct and specific pathway (`NAIP2`-`NLRC4`) exists for the given stimulus. Furthermore, the claim that `NAIP5^{-/-}` macrophages are unresponsive is false. The reasoning provided (inability to recruit `ASC`) is also misleading; `NLRC4` is fully capable of assembling and activating `caspase-1` upon `NAIP2` engagement in `NAIP5^{-/-}` cells. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2862087"}]}
