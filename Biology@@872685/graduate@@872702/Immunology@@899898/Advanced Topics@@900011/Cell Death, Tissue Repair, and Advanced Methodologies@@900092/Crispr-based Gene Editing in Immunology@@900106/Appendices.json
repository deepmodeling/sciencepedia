It provides a simplified but coherent biophysical model for CRISPR-Cas9 gRNA specificity, along with all necessary parameters and data to compute a defined score. Therefore, a rigorous solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for a specificity score, defined as the fraction of total cleavage events that occur at the intended on-target site. We are given a model where the cleavage likelihood at any site is related to the mismatch penalties between the guide RNA (gRNA) and the DNA target.\n\nLet $L_k$ denote the relative likelihood of cleavage at a site $k$. The on-target site, denoted by the subscript $on$, has by definition zero mismatches. For any off-target site, denoted by the subscript $off,j$, there is a set of mismatched nucleotide positions, $M_j$. The total mismatch penalty for this off-target site, $W_j$, is the sum of position-specific mismatch penalty weights, $w_i$, for all mismatched positions $i \\in M_j$.\n$$ W_j = \\sum_{i \\in M_j} w_i $$\nFor the on-target site, the set of mismatches is empty, so its total penalty is $W_{on} = 0$.\n\nThe problem states that a unit of weighted mismatch penalty results in a ten-fold reduction in cleavage likelihood. This implies an exponential relationship. The relative cleavage likelihood, $L_k$, for a site with a total penalty $W_k$ can be expressed as:\n$$ L_k \\propto 10^{-W_k} $$\nLet the proportionality constant be $C$. Then, the likelihood at the on-target site is $L_{on} = C \\times 10^{-W_{on}} = C \\times 10^{-0} = C$. The likelihood for the $j$-th off-target site is $L_{off,j} = C \\times 10^{-W_j}$.\n\nThe specificity score, $S$, is the ratio of the on-target cleavage likelihood to the sum of all cleavage likelihoods (on-target plus all off-targets).\n$$ S = \\frac{L_{on}}{L_{on} + \\sum_{j} L_{off,j}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for likelihood:\n$$ S = \\frac{C}{C + \\sum_{j} C \\times 10^{-W_j}} = \\frac{C}{C \\left(1 + \\sum_{j} 10^{-W_j}\\right)} $$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the specificity score:\n$$ S = \\frac{1}{1 + \\sum_{j} 10^{-W_j}} $$\nwhere the sum is over all predicted off-target loci for a given gRNA.\n\nWe now apply this formula to each candidate gRNA using the provided mismatch penalty weights:\n- $w_i = 2$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$\n- $w_i = 1$ for $i \\in \\{6,7,8,9,10\\}$\n- $w_i = 0.5$ for $i \\in \\{11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20\\}$\n\nFor each candidate, we first calculate the total penalty $W_j$ for each of its off-target sites, then compute the term $\\sum_{j} 10^{-W_j}$, which we will denote as $\\Sigma_{off}$.\n\nCandidate A: Off-target mismatch sets $\\{12,18\\}$, $\\{7\\}$, $\\{2,14\\}$.\n- Off-target 1: Mismatches at $\\{12, 18\\}$. $W_1 = w_{12} + w_{18} = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0$.\n- Off-target 2: Mismatch at $\\{7\\}$. $W_2 = w_7 = 1.0$.\n- Off-target 3: Mismatches at $\\{2, 14\\}$. $W_3 = w_2 + w_{14} = 2.0 + 0.5 = 2.5$.\n$\\Sigma_{off,A} = 10^{-1.0} + 10^{-1.0} + 10^{-2.5} = 0.1 + 0.1 + 10^{-2.5} \\approx 0.2 + 0.003162 = 0.203162$.\n$S_A = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.203162} \\approx 0.83114$.\n\nCandidate B: Off-target mismatch sets $\\{6,9\\}$, $\\{16\\}$, $\\{3\\}$, $\\{1,8,15\\}$.\n- Off-target 1: Mismatches at $\\{6, 9\\}$. $W_1 = w_6 + w_9 = 1.0 + 1.0 = 2.0$.\n- Off-target 2: Mismatch at $\\{16\\}$. $W_2 = w_{16} = 0.5$.\n- Off-target 3: Mismatch at $\\{3\\}$. $W_3 = w_3 = 2.0$.\n- Off-target 4: Mismatches at $\\{1, 8, 15\\}$. $W_4 = w_1 + w_8 + w_{15} = 2.0 + 1.0 + 0.5 = 3.5$.\n$\\Sigma_{off,B} = 10^{-2.0} + 10^{-0.5} + 10^{-2.0} + 10^{-3.5} \\approx 0.01 + 0.316228 + 0.01 + 0.000316 = 0.336544$.\n$S_B = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.336544} \\approx 0.74823$.\n\nCandidate C: Off-target mismatch sets $\\{4\\}$, $\\{5,6\\}$.\n- Off-target 1: Mismatch at $\\{4\\}$. $W_1 = w_4 = 2.0$.\n- Off-target 2: Mismatches at $\\{5, 6\\}$. $W_2 = w_5 + w_6 = 2.0 + 1.0 = 3.0$.\n$\\Sigma_{off,C} = 10^{-2.0} + 10^{-3.0} = 0.01 + 0.001 = 0.011$.\n$S_C = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.011} = \\frac{1}{1.011} \\approx 0.98912$.\n\nCandidate D: Off-target mismatch sets $\\{11,20\\}$, $\\{13\\}$, $\\{10\\}$, $\\{17,18,19\\}$, $\\{2,12\\}$.\n- Off-target 1: Mismatches at $\\{11, 20\\}$. $W_1 = w_{11} + w_{20} = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0$.\n- Off-target 2: Mismatch at $\\{13\\}$. $W_2 = w_{13} = 0.5$.\n- Off-target 3: Mismatch at $\\{10\\}$. $W_3 = w_{10} = 1.0$.\n- Off-target 4: Mismatches at $\\{17, 18, 19\\}$. $W_4 = w_{17} + w_{18} + w_{19} = 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.5$.\n- Off-target 5: Mismatches at $\\{2, 12\\}$. $W_5 = w_2 + w_{12} = 2.0 + 0.5 = 2.5$.\n$\\Sigma_{off,D} = 10^{-1.0} + 10^{-0.5} + 10^{-1.0} + 10^{-1.5} + 10^{-2.5} \\approx 0.1 + 0.316228 + 0.1 + 0.031623 + 0.003162 = 0.551013$.\n$S_D = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.551013} \\approx 0.64474$.\n\nThe computed specificity scores are:\n- $S_A \\approx 0.83114$\n- $S_B \\approx 0.74823$\n- $S_C \\approx 0.98912$\n- $S_D \\approx 0.64474$\n\nThe candidates are ranked from highest to lowest specificity as follows: Candidate C $>$ Candidate A $>$ Candidate B $>$ Candidate D.

Starting with an initial population `$N_{MT}(0)$`, the number after `$n$` cycles is given by a geometric progression:\n$$\nN_{MT}(n) = N_{MT}(0) \\cdot 2^n\n$$\n\nNext, consider the *TP53*-wild-type (WT) cells. Their proliferation depends on the probability of a double-strand break (DSB) and the subsequent cell-cycle arrest. In each cycle, a single WT cell has two possible outcomes:\n1.  The cell divides, producing `$2$` daughter cells. This occurs if there is no DSB (probability `$1-d$`) or if there is a DSB (probability `$d$`) but the cell does not arrest (probability `$1-a$`). The total probability of division is `$P_{div} = (1-d) + d(1-a) = 1-d+d-da = 1-da$`.\n2.  The cell arrests, producing `$1$` surviving cell for the next cycle. This occurs if there is a DSB (probability `$d$`) and the cell arrests (probability `$a$`). The probability of arrest is `$P_{arrest} = da$`.\n\nThe expected number of cells produced by a single WT cell after one cycle is the weighted average of these outcomes:\n$$\n\\text{Growth Factor}_{WT} = 2 \\cdot P_{div} + 1 \\cdot P_{arrest} = 2(1-da) + 1(da) = 2 - 2da + da = 2 - da\n$$\nSince all cells are assumed to act independently, the entire WT population grows by this factor in each cycle. The number of WT cells after `$n$` cycles is therefore:\n$$\nN_{WT}(n) = N_{WT}(0) \\cdot (2 - da)^n\n$$\n\nNow we can calculate the ratio of the populations after `$n$` cycles:\n$$\n\\frac{N_{MT}(n)}{N_{WT}(n)} = \\frac{N_{MT}(0) \\cdot 2^n}{N_{WT}(0) \\cdot (2 - da)^n} = \\frac{N_{MT}(0)}{N_{WT}(0)} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{2 - da}\\right)^n\n$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this result into the expression for enrichment `$E$`:\n$$\nE = \\frac{N_{MT}(n) / N_{WT}(n)}{N_{MT}(0) / N_{WT}(0)} = \\frac{\\frac{N_{MT}(0)}{N_{WT}(0)} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{2 - da}\\right)^n}{\\frac{N_{MT}(0)}{N_{WT}(0)}}\n$$\nThe initial ratio `$\\frac{N_{MT}(0)}{N_{WT}(0)}$` cancels out, yielding the closed-form expression for enrichment as a function of `$a$`, `$d$`, and `$n$`:\n$$\nE = \\left(\\frac{2}{2 - da}\\right)^n\n$$\nThis result quantifies the selective advantage conferred by loss-of-function *TP53* mutations under conditions of continuous DNA damage, which is a key concept in cancer evolution and a documented artifact of CRISPR-based therapies.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{2}{2 - da}\\right)^{n}}\n$$", "id": "2844564"}]}
