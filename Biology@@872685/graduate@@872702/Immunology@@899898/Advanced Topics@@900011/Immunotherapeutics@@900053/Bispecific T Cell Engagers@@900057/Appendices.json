The total concentration of BiTEs is $[B_{tot}] = [B_{A,free}] + [B_{A,mem}] + [B_{A,sol}]$.\nFrom the definition of the dissociation constant, $K_{d} = \\frac{[L_{free}][R_{free}]}{[LR_{complex}]}$, we have:\n$$\nK_{d,A} = \\frac{[B_{A,free}][A_{mem}]}{[B_{A,mem}]} \\implies [B_{A,mem}] = \\frac{[B_{A,free}][A_{mem}]}{K_{d,A}}\n$$\n$$\nK_{d,A} = \\frac{[B_{A,free}][A_{sol}]}{[B_{A,sol}]} \\implies [B_{A,sol}] = \\frac{[B_{A,free}][A_{sol}]}{K_{d,A}}\n$$\nWe have used the non-depletion assumption, which implies the free concentrations of antigens are equal to their total concentrations. Substituting these into the conservation equation for $[B_{tot}]$:\n$$\n[B_{tot}] = [B_{A,free}] + \\frac{[B_{A,free}][A_{mem}]}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{[B_{A,free}][A_{sol}]}{K_{d,A}} = [B_{A,free}] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[A_{mem}]}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{[A_{sol}]}{K_{d,A}} \\right)\n$$\nThe probability that Arm A is bound to membrane antigen, $P(A_{mem})$, is the fraction $\\frac{[B_{A,mem}]}{[B_{tot}]}$:\n$$\nP(A_{mem}) = \\frac{\\frac{[B_{A,free}][A_{mem}]}{K_{d,A}}}{[B_{A,free}] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[A_{mem}]}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{[A_{sol}]}{K_{d,A}} \\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{[A_{mem}]}{K_{d,A}}}{1 + \\frac{[A_{mem}]}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{[A_{sol}]}{K_{d,A}}} = \\frac{[A_{mem}]}{K_{d,A} + [A_{mem}] + [A_{sol}]}\n$$\n\nFor the anti-CD3 arm (Arm C), there is no competitor. Let $[B_{C,free}]$ and $[B_{C,mem}]$ be the concentrations of BiTEs with Arm C unbound and bound to $C_{mem}$, respectively. $[B_{tot}] = [B_{C,free}] + [B_{C,mem}]$.\n$$\nK_{d,C} = \\frac{[B_{C,free}][C_{mem}]}{[B_{C,mem}]} \\implies [B_{C,mem}] = \\frac{[B_{C,free}][C_{mem}]}{K_{d,C}}\n$$\nSubstituting into the conservation equation:\n$$\n[B_{tot}] = [B_{C,free}] + \\frac{[B_{C,free}][C_{mem}]}{K_{d,C}} = [B_{C,free}] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[C_{mem}]}{K_{d,C}} \\right)\n$$\nThe probability that Arm C is bound to membrane CD3, $P(C_{mem})$, is the fraction $\\frac{[B_{C,mem}]}{[B_{tot}]}$:\n$$\nP(C_{mem}) = \\frac{\\frac{[B_{C,free}][C_{mem}]}{K_{d,C}}}{[B_{C,free}] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[C_{mem}]}{K_{d,C}} \\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{[C_{mem}]}{K_{d,C}}}{1 + \\frac{[C_{mem}]}{K_{d,C}}} = \\frac{[C_{mem}]}{K_{d,C} + [C_{mem}]}\n$$\n\nThe productive bridge is formed when Arm A binds $A_{mem}$ and Arm C binds $C_{mem}$. Due to the assumption of independent arm binding, the fraction of productive bridges, $F_{prod}$, is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$\nF_{prod} = P(A_{mem}) \\times P(C_{mem})\n$$\nWe define the fraction of productive bridges in the presence of soluble antigen ($[A_{sol}] > 0$) as $F_{with}$, and in its absence ($[A_{sol}] = 0$) as $F_{without}$.\n\nWith soluble antigen:\n$$\nF_{with} = P(A_{mem})_{with} \\times P(C_{mem}) = \\left( \\frac{[A_{mem}]}{K_{d,A} + [A_{mem}] + [A_{sol}]} \\right) \\left( \\frac{[C_{mem}]}{K_{d,C} + [C_{mem}]} \\right)\n$$\nWithout soluble antigen, the term for $P(A_{mem})$ simplifies as $[A_{sol}]=0$:\n$$\nP(A_{mem})_{without} = \\frac{[A_{mem}]}{K_{d,A} + [A_{mem}]}\n$$\n$$\nF_{without} = P(A_{mem})_{without} \\times P(C_{mem}) = \\left( \\frac{[A_{mem}]}{K_{d,A} + [A_{mem}]} \\right) \\left( \\frac{[C_{mem}]}{K_{d,C} + [C_{mem}]} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the ratio $R = \\frac{F_{with}}{F_{without}}$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{[A_{mem}]}{K_{d,A} + [A_{mem}] + [A_{sol}]} \\right) \\left( \\frac{[C_{mem}]}{K_{d,C} + [C_{mem}]} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{[A_{mem}]}{K_{d,A} + [A_{mem}]} \\right) \\left( \\frac{[C_{mem}]}{K_{d,C} + [C_{mem}]} \\right)}\n$$\nThe term for $P(C_{mem})$ cancels, which is logical as it is unaffected by the soluble competitor for the other arm.\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\frac{[A_{mem}]}{K_{d,A} + [A_{mem}] + [A_{sol}]}}{\\frac{[A_{mem}]}{K_{d,A} + [A_{mem}]}} = \\frac{K_{d,A} + [A_{mem}]}{K_{d,A} + [A_{mem}] + [A_{sol}]}\n$$\nThis is the final symbolic expression for the ratio.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $R$ numerically using the given parameters: $K_{d,A} = 2\\,\\text{nM}$, $[A_{mem}] \\approx 0.83029\\,\\text{nM}$, and $[A_{sol}] = 10\\,\\text{nM}$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{2\\,\\text{nM} + 0.83029\\,\\text{nM}}{2\\,\\text{nM} + 0.83029\\,\\text{nM} + 10\\,\\text{nM}} = \\frac{2.83029}{12.83029}\n$$\n$$\nR \\approx 0.220593...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.2206$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.2206}\n$$", "id": "2837301"}]}
