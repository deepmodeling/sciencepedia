Checkpoint blockade therapies are designed to tip this balance in favor of effector functions to fight cancer, but this can inadvertently lead to autoimmunity.

Consider a simple one-step model grounded in proportional change: if a population increases by a relative amount $p$, its next value is multiplied by $(1+p)$; if an effective capacity is reduced by a fraction $q$, its next effective value is multiplied by $(1-q)$. A patient starts with $100$ effector T cells and $100$ regulatory T cells. After one time step under checkpoint blockade, effector T cell proliferation increases by $30\\%$, and Treg suppressive capacity is reduced by $50\\%$, which we model as the effective Treg count being halved.

The model, based on proportional change, is a standard first-order approximation and does not violate any scientific principles. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary initial conditions and a clear, unambiguous rule for calculation, ensuring a unique solution exists. The data are self-consistent; the statement that Treg capacity is \"reduced by $50\\%$\" is explicitly equated to the \"effective Treg count being halved,\" which corresponds to multiplication by $(1 - 0.50) = 0.50$. All terms are defined, and the question is objective. The problem is therefore deemed valid as it presents a straightforward mathematical modeling exercise within a legitimate scientific context.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the new ratio of effective effector T cells to effective regulatory T cells after one discrete time step. Let $N_{Teff}(t)$ and $N_{Treg}(t)$ denote the number of effector and regulatory T cells at time step $t$, respectively.\n\nThe initial state at $t=0$ is given:\n$$ N_{Teff}(0) = 100 $$\n$$ N_{Treg}(0) = 100 $$\nThe initial effector-to-Treg ratio, $R(0)$, is therefore:\n$$ R(0) = \\frac{N_{Teff}(0)}{N_{Treg}(0)} = \\frac{100}{100} = 1 $$\n\nAfter one time step, we are to compute the new populations, $N_{Teff}(1)$ and the effective $N_{Treg,eff}(1)$.\n\nFor the effector T cells, the population proliferation increases by a relative amount $p = 30\\% = 0.30$. According to the specified proportional change rule, the new population $N_{Teff}(1)$ is:\n$$ N_{Teff}(1) = N_{Teff}(0) \\times (1 + p) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ N_{Teff}(1) = 100 \\times (1 + 0.30) = 100 \\times 1.30 = 130 $$\n\nFor the regulatory T cells, their suppressive capacity is reduced by a fraction $q = 50\\% = 0.50$. This is explicitly modeled as the effective Treg count being modified. The rule for reduction implies the new effective count, $N_{Treg,eff}(1)$, is:\n$$ N_{Treg,eff}(1) = N_{Treg}(0) \\times (1 - q) $$\nThis is consistent with the problem's statement that the \"effective Treg count being halved,\" as $1 - q = 1 - 0.50 = 0.50$.\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ N_{Treg,eff}(1) = 100 \\times (1 - 0.50) = 100 \\times 0.50 = 50 $$\n\nThe new effective effector-to-Treg ratio, $R(1)$, is the ratio of these two new quantities:\n$$ R(1) = \\frac{N_{Teff}(1)}{N_{Treg,eff}(1)} $$\nSubstituting the calculated values for the populations at $t=1$:\n$$ R(1) = \\frac{130}{50} $$\nThis fraction simplifies to:\n$$ R(1) = \\frac{13}{5} = 2.6 $$\nThis is the final required value, a pure number representing the new ratio.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.6}$$", "id": "2858110"}, {"introduction": "Moving from mechanism to clinical practice, diagnosing an irAE like pneumonitis requires careful interpretation of diagnostic tests.

You are considering ICI-associated pneumonitis as part of the differential diagnosis.

This is a direct application of Bayes' theorem. We begin by formally defining the events and probabilities.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has ICI-associated pneumonitis.\nLet $D^c$ be the complementary event, that the patient does not have ICI-associated pneumonitis.\nLet $+$ denote a positive test result.\nLet $-$ denote a negative test result.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are translated into probabilistic terms as follows:\nThe pre-test probability of the disease, or prevalence in this context, is $P(D) = 0.10$.\nThe sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present. This is a conditional probability: $S_e = P(+|D) = 0.85$.\nThe specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test result given that the disease is absent: $S_p = P(-|D^c) = 0.90$.\n\nFrom the pre-test probability, we can deduce the probability of the complementary event:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$$\n\nWe are asked to find the post-test probability of disease given a positive test result, which is the conditional probability $P(D|+)$.\n\nBayes' theorem provides the formal structure for this calculation:\n$$P(D|+) = \\frac{P(+|D) P(D)}{P(+)}$$\n\nThe term in the denominator, $P(+)$, represents the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, which partitions the event $+$ over the sample space defined by $D$ and $D^c$:\n$$P(+) = P(+ \\cap D) + P(+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can rewrite this as:\n$$P(+) = P(+|D) P(D) + P(+|D^c) P(D^c)$$\n\nWe have the values for $P(+|D)$, $P(D)$, and $P(D^c)$. The term $P(+|D^c)$, the probability of a positive test in a patient without the disease (the false positive rate), must be derived from the specificity. The events of obtaining a positive or negative result for a patient without the disease are complementary. Thus:\n$$P(+|D^c) + P(-|D^c) = 1$$\nWe can solve for the false positive rate:\n$$P(+|D^c) = 1 - P(-|D^c) = 1 - S_p = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$$\n\nNow we substitute this back into the law of total probability expression:\n$$P(+) = (P(+|D) \\cdot P(D)) + ((1 - S_p) \\cdot (1 - P(D)))$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this full expression for $P(+)$ into the denominator of Bayes' theorem to obtain the general formula for the post-test probability in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and pre-test probability:\n$$P(D|+) = \\frac{P(+|D) P(D)}{P(+|D) P(D) + P(+|D^c) P(D^c)} = \\frac{S_e \\cdot P(D)}{S_e \\cdot P(D) + (1 - S_p) \\cdot (1 - P(D))}$$\n\nThis is the derived expression requested.

The first part is the true positive probability, which we just calculated as $0.085$.
