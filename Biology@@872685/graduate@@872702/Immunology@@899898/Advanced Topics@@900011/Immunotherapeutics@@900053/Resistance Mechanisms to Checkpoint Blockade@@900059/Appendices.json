This requires a peptide to have at least one allele-specific $\\mathrm{IC}_{50} \\leq 50$ nM to an HLA allele that is *retained* after LOH.\nThe LOH events result in the loss of alleles A*24:02 and C*03:04.\nThe set of retained alleles is: {A*02:01, B*07:02, B*15:01, C*07:02}.\n\nWe re-evaluate the $14$ high-affinity neoantigens against this retained allele set:\n- $P_1$: Retains high-affinity presentation via A*02:01 and B*15:01. **Yes**.\n- $P_2$: The sole high-affinity binding was to the lost allele A*24:02.

No.\n- $P_{15}$: Retains high-affinity presentation via C*07:02. **Yes**.\n\nThe number of neoantigens remaining presentable at high affinity is $N_{retained} = 9$.\n\nThird, we compute the required fraction, which is the number of remaining presentable neoantigens divided by the total number of high-affinity neoantigens prior to LOH.\n$$\n\\text{Fraction} = \\frac{N_{retained}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{9}{14}\n$$\nThis fraction is in its simplest reduced form, as the numerator is $3^2$ and the denominator is $2 \\times 7$, sharing no common prime factors.\n\nFourth, we will briefly discuss the mechanistic implication of this fraction. The efficacy of checkpoint blockade therapies, such as those targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, is contingent upon the pre-existence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes that can recognize and target tumor cells. This recognition is mediated by T-cell receptors binding to neoantigen peptides presented on the tumor cell surface by MHC (HLA) molecules. The fraction $\\frac{9}{14}$ quantifies the proportion of the high-affinity neoantigen repertoire that is preserved despite the tumor's evolution of LOH at specific HLA loci, a known mechanism of immune escape. A higher value indicates that a substantial set of diverse targets remains for T-cell recognition. In this case, since more than half of the high-affinity neoantigenic landscape is retained ($>64\\%$), it suggests that the tumor has not completely evaded immune surveillance via this specific mechanism. Therefore, this finding would inform a cautiously optimistic expectation that reinvigorating T-cells with PD-1 blockade could be effective, as a sufficient number and variety of targets are still presented by the tumor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{9}{14}}$$", "id": "2887330"}, {"introduction": "Resistance to checkpoint blockade is not solely dictated by the tumor cells themselves; the surrounding tumor microenvironment is a decisive factor.

It presents a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective formulation of a discrete-time evolutionary model for tumor clonal dynamics under immunotherapy. All parameters, initial conditions, and governing equations are provided, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. We shall proceed with the derivation of the computational solution.\n\nThe problem requires the simulation of a model describing the competition between $3$ tumor clones, indexed by $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The state of the system at any discrete time $t$ is given by the vector of clonal frequencies, $x(t) = (x_1(t), x_2(t), x_3(t))$, which must satisfy $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_i(t) = 1$. Each clone possesses two fixed traits: antigenicity $a_i \\in [0, 1]$ and Interferon (IFN) signaling effectiveness $s_i \\in [0, 1]$. The specific clonal traits are given as:\n- Clone $1$: $(a_1, s_1) = (0.9, 0.9)$ (immune-visible, IFN-intact)\n- Clone $2$: $(a_2, s_2) = (0.6, 0.5)$ (intermediate)\n- Clone $3$: $(a_3, s_3) = (0.2, 0.2)$ (immune-escape, IFN-impaired)\n\nThe core of the evolutionary dynamics lies in the fitness function, $w_i(B_t)$, which determines the reproductive success of each clone under an immune pressure $B_t \\ge 0$. The fitness is given by:\n$$\nw_i(B_t) = \\exp\\!\\Big(r - \\alpha B_t a_i - \\beta B_t s_i - c_a(1-a_i) - c_s(1-s_i)\\Big)\n$$\nThis expression comprises several terms within the exponent, which represents the net growth rate:\n- $r$: The baseline intrinsic growth rate, equal for all clones, given as $r=0.5$.\n- $-\\alpha B_t a_i$: A fitness penalty from T-cell cytotoxicity, proportional to the immune pressure $B_t$ and the clone's antigenicity $a_i$. The scaling factor is $\\alpha = 2.0$.\n- $-\\beta B_t s_i$: A fitness penalty from the antiproliferative effects of IFN signaling, proportional to $B_t$ and the clone's signaling effectiveness $s_i$. The scaling factor is $\\beta = 1.0$.\n- $-c_a(1-a_i)$ and $-c_s(1-s_i)$: Intrinsic costs associated with immune evasion mechanisms (low antigenicity and impaired IFN signaling). The cost coefficients are $c_a = 0.4$ and $c_s = 0.4$.\n\nThe evolution of frequencies from one generation to the next is governed by a replicator-mutator equation. This update rule can be decomposed into two fundamental processes: natural selection and mutation. The combined update for the frequency of clone $i$ is:\n$$\nx_i(t+1) = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{3} x_j(t)\\, w_j(B_t)\\, Q_{j\\to i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{3}\\sum_{j=1}^{3} x_j(t)\\, w_j(B_t)\\, Q_{j\\to k}}\n$$\nThe term $Q_{j\\to i}$ represents the probability of a clone of type $j$ mutating into a clone of type $i$ in a single generation. The denominator serves as a normalization factor, ensuring that the new frequencies sum to $1$. Given that the mutation matrix $Q$ is right stochastic (i.e., $\\sum_k Q_{j\\to k} = 1$ for any $j$), the denominator simplifies to the mean population fitness, $\\bar{w}(t) = \\sum_j x_j(t) w_j(B_t)$. The mutation matrix $Q$ is specified as:\n$$\nQ =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1-\\mu & \\mu & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1-\\mu & \\mu \\\\\n0 & \\nu & 1-\\nu\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the forward mutation rate and $\\nu$ is the rare reversion rate. This structure models a directed path of resistance acquisition from clone $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$.\n\nThe computational task is to implement this model and simulate its trajectory for a total of $T = T_{\\mathrm{pre}} + T_{\\mathrm{post}}$ time steps. The simulation is divided into a pre-treatment phase of $T_{\\mathrm{pre}}$ steps with immune pressure $B_{\\mathrm{pre}}$, and an on-treatment phase of $T_{\\mathrm{post}}$ steps with pressure $B_{\\mathrm{post}}$. The algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Initialize the clonal frequency vector $x(0)$ using the values provided for a given test case.\n2.  Set up all fixed parameters ($r, \\alpha, \\beta, c_a, c_s$) and the clonal trait vectors $a = (a_1, a_2, a_3)$ and $s = (s_1, s_2, s_3)$.\n3.  Define the case-specific parameters: $T_{\\mathrm{pre}}, T_{\\mathrm{post}}, B_{\\mathrm{pre}}, B_{\\mathrm{post}}, \\mu, \\nu$.\n4.  Construct the mutation matrix $Q$ using the given $\\mu$ and $\\nu$.\n5.  Iterate for $t$ from $0$ to $T-1$:\n    a. Determine the current immune pressure: $B_t = B_{\\mathrm{pre}}$ if $t < T_{\\mathrm{pre}}$, and $B_t = B_{\\mathrm{post}}$ otherwise.\n    b. Compute the fitness vector $w(B_t) = (w_1(B_t), w_2(B_t), w_3(B_t))$ using the vectorized form of the fitness function.\n    c. Apply the update rule. This is efficiently done with vector and matrix operations. First, compute the result of selection: $v(t) = x(t) \\odot w(B_t)$, where $\\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication. Second, apply mutation via matrix multiplication: $x_{\\mathrm{next, unnormalized}} = v(t) \\cdot Q$. Third, normalize to get the new frequency vector: $x(t+1) = x_{\\mathrm{next, unnormalized}} / \\sum_i (x_{\\mathrm{next, unnormalized}})_i$.\n6.  After the loop terminates, the final vector is $x(T)$. Report the third component, $x_3(T)$, which is the final frequency of the immune-escape clone.
