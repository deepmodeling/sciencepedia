A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe problem states that the cell population follows first-order proliferation, which means the rate of increase of the cell population, $\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}$, is directly proportional to the number of cells, $N(t)$, at that time. This is described by the first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = k N(t)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the specific growth rate constant.\n\nTo find the function $N(t)$, we solve this differential equation by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N(t)} dN(t) = k \\, dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides. The integration on the left is from the initial cell number $N_0$ at time $t=0$ to the cell number $N(t)$ at a later time $t$. The integration on the right is over the corresponding time interval from $0$ to $t$.\n$$\n\\int_{N_0}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{N} dN = \\int_{0}^{t} k \\, d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n[\\ln(N)]_{N_0}^{N(t)} = [k\\tau]_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N_0) = k(t - 0)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = kt\n$$\nExponentiating both sides yields the expression for exponential growth:\n$$\nN(t) = N_0 \\exp(kt)\n$$\nThe problem provides the doubling time, $T_d$, which is the time required for the population to double. At $t = T_d$, we have $N(T_d) = 2N_0$. Substituting this into our growth equation gives:\n$$\n2N_0 = N_0 \\exp(k T_d)\n$$\n$$\n2 = \\exp(k T_d)\n$$\nWe solve for the growth rate constant, $k$, by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(2) = k T_d\n$$\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_d}\n$$\nNow we substitute this expression for $k$ back into the equation for $N(t)$:\n$$\nN(t) = N_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_d} t\\right)\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\exp(a \\ln(b)) = b^a$, we can rewrite this as:\n$$\nN(t) = N_0 \\left(\\exp(\\ln(2))\\right)^{t/T_d} = N_0 \\cdot 2^{t/T_d}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for $N(t)$.\n\nNext, we compute the total cell number after $t = 10$ days. The problem gives $T_d$ in hours, so we must ensure consistent units.

The parameters provided are physically realistic for biomolecular interactions at an immunological synapse. The objective is clear and the assumptions, such as the non-depletion of free ligand, are explicitly stated, rendering the problem well-posed. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe binding of a receptor, $R$, to a ligand, $L$, to form a complex, $RL$, is described by the reversible reaction:\n$$ R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL $$\nThis is stipulated as a $1{:}1$ non-cooperative equilibrium.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of the forward reaction (association) is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants:\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{association}} = k_{\\text{on}}[R][L] $$\nwhere $k_{\\text{on}}$ is the association rate constant.\n\nThe rate of the reverse reaction (dissociation) is proportional to the concentration of the product:\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{dissociation}} = k_{\\text{off}}[RL] $$\nwhere $k_{\\text{off}}$ is the dissociation rate constant.\n\nAt equilibrium, the rate of association equals the rate of dissociation:\n$$ k_{\\text{on}}[R][L] = k_{\\text{off}}[RL] $$\n\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined as the ratio of the concentrations of the dissociated species to the concentration of the bound complex at equilibrium. Rearranging the equilibrium condition gives this definition:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]} $$\n\nThe fraction of occupied receptors, $\\theta$, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of occupied receptors, $[RL]$, to the total concentration of receptors, $[R]_{\\text{total}}$. The total receptor concentration is the sum of free (unbound) receptors, $[R]$, and occupied (bound) receptors, $[RL]$:\n$$ [R]_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [RL] $$\nTherefore, the expression for $\\theta$ is:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]} $$\n\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_d$, we must eliminate $[R]$ from this equation. From the definition of $K_d$, we can express the free receptor concentration $[R]$ as:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]} $$\nIt is assumed that the free ligand concentration, $[L]$, is not significantly depleted by binding, so it can be treated as a constant parameter equal to the given value of $10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{M}$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into the denominator of the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{\\left(\\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]}\\right) + [RL]} $$\n\nWe can factor out the term $[RL]$ from the denominator:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL]\\left(\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1\\right)} $$\n\nAssuming a non-zero concentration of ligand and receptors, $[RL]$ is non-zero, and we can cancel this term from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1} $$\n\nTo simplify, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $[L]$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]} $$\nThis is the required expression for the fraction of occupied receptors.

The target is a well-validated lineage-restricted surface antigen, denoted as antigen X. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry show that $90\\%$ of tumor cells express antigen X on the surface. However, single-cell transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry for Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I reveal that $60\\%$ of tumor cells have lost MHC class I expression due to defects in antigen processing machinery. The TCR product is specific for an antigen X-derived peptide presented by Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-A*02:01, and the patient is HLA-A*02:01 positive. The CAR product recognizes antigen X on the cell surface and does not rely on MHC.\n\nFor conceptual modeling, assume the tumor is composed of three non-interconverting subpopulations at treatment initiation:\n- Subpopulation $1$: MHC class I positive, antigen X positive ($30\\%$ of total).\n- Subpopulation $2$: MHC class I negative, antigen X positive ($60\\%$ of total).\n- Subpopulation $3$: antigen X negative ($10\\%$ of total).\n\nAssume each subpopulation grows approximately exponentially with an intrinsic per-capita growth rate $r = 0.2\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$ in the absence of therapy.

TCR-engineered T cells will fail to induce objective responses because most tumor cells are MHC class I negative; CAR T cells will induce a significant initial tumor regression by killing antigen X-positive cells regardless of MHC class I status, but relapse will occur via outgrowth of the antigen X-negative subpopulation.\n\nB. TCR-engineered T cells will outperform CAR T cells because their higher per-capita kill rate will drive a durable remission across the entire tumor despite MHC class I loss.\n\nC. Both therapies will fail equally because antigen presentation on MHC class I is required for recognition by both TCR-engineered T cells and CAR T cells.\n\nD. CAR T cells will be ineffective because target peptides are not presented on MHC class I, whereas TCR-engineered T cells will remain effective by recognizing the native surface antigen X.\n\nE. TCR-engineered T cells will indirectly cure the tumor by provoking Natural Killer cell clearance of MHC class I negative cells, whereas CAR T cells will not, resulting in superior durability for TCR therapy despite the MHC class I loss.", "solution": "The validity of the problem statement must be rigorously ascertained before any attempt at a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides the following data and conditions:\n- **Tumor Subpopulations at Initiation**:\n    - Subpopulation $1$: MHC class I positive, antigen X positive.

The distinct recognition mechanisms of TCRs (peptide-MHC) and CARs (native surface antigen), and the common tumor escape mechanisms of MHC loss and antigen loss, are fundamental concepts in cancer immunotherapy. The use of a logistic-like population model with growth and kill rates is a standard formalization in mathematical oncology. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: All necessary parameters ($r$, $k_{\\text{TCR}}$, $k_{\\text{CAR}}$), initial conditions (subpopulation fractions), and rules of interaction are provided. The question asks for a qualitative prediction based on a quantitative model, for which a unique outcome can be determined. The problem is well-posed.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is precise and unbiased. The scenario is described with quantitative data and clear, objective rules, leaving no room for subjective interpretation.\n4.  **Consistency**: The subpopulation fractions sum to $100\\%$ ($30\\% + 60\\% + 10\\% = 100\\%$). The description of the total tumor composition (90% antigen X positive, 60% MHC class I negative) is perfectly consistent with the defined subpopulations. The problem is internally consistent.\n5.  **Realism**: The chosen parameter values and the scenario itself (heterogeneous tumor with pre-existing resistance mechanisms) are plausible and reflect real-world clinical challenges in adoptive cell therapy.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution can be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe analysis hinges on calculating the effective per-capita growth rate, $r_{\\text{eff}}$, for each subpopulation under each therapeutic modality. The effective rate is defined as $r_{\\text{eff}} = r - k$, where $r$ is the intrinsic growth rate and $k$ is the applicable per-capita kill rate. A subpopulation will shrink if $r_{\\text{eff}} < 0$ and grow if $r_{\\text{eff}} > 0$.\n\n**Analysis of TCR-engineered T cell therapy**\nTCR-engineered T cells recognize a peptide derived from antigen X presented on MHC class I.\n- **Subpopulation 1 (MHC+, AgX+)**: This subpopulation meets the targeting criteria.\n    - The applicable kill rate is $k = k_{\\text{TCR}} = 0.5\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$.\n    - The effective growth rate is $r_{\\text{eff,1,TCR}} = r - k_{\\text{TCR}} = 0.2 - 0.5 = -0.3\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$.\n    - Since $r_{\\text{eff,1,TCR}} < 0$, this subpopulation will shrink.\n- **Subpopulation 2 (MHC-, AgX+)**: This subpopulation lacks MHC class I expression.\n    - The applicable kill rate is $k = 0\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$.\n    - The effective growth rate is $r_{\\text{eff,2,TCR}} = r - 0 = 0.2\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$.\n    - Since $r_{\\text{eff,2,TCR}} > 0$, this subpopulation will grow.\n- **Subpopulation 3 (AgX-)**: This subpopulation lacks antigen X.\n    - The applicable kill rate is $k = 0\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$.\n    - The effective growth rate is $r_{\\text{eff,3,TCR}} = r - 0 = 0.2\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$.\n    - Since $r_{\\text{eff,3,TCR}} > 0$, this subpopulation will grow.\n\n**Outcome for TCR Therapy**: Only $30\\%$ of the initial tumor mass is targeted and shrinks. The remaining $70\\%$ (subpopulations $2$ and $3$) is resistant and will continue to grow exponentially. The dominant subpopulation ($60\\%$ of the tumor) is resistant due to MHC class I loss. Therefore, the therapy will fail to control the overall tumor burden and will not induce an objective response.\n\n**Analysis of CAR T cell therapy**\nCAR T cells recognize the native surface antigen X, independent of MHC presentation.\n- **Subpopulation 1 (MHC+, AgX+)**: This subpopulation expresses antigen X.\n    - The applicable kill rate is $k = k_{\\text{CAR}} = 0.35\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$.\n    - The effective growth rate is $r_{\\text{eff,1,CAR}} = r - k_{\\text{CAR}} = 0.2 - 0.35 = -0.15\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$.\n    - Since $r_{\\text{eff,1,CAR}} < 0$, this subpopulation will shrink.\n- **Subpopulation 2 (MHC-, AgX+)**: This subpopulation also expresses antigen X.\n    - The applicable kill rate is $k = k_{\\text{CAR}} = 0.35\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$.\n    - The effective growth rate is $r_{\\text{eff,2,CAR}} = r - k_{\\text{CAR}} = 0.2 - 0.35 = -0.15\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$.\n    - Since $r_{\\text{eff,2,CAR}} < 0$, this subpopulation will shrink.\n- **Subpopulation 3 (AgX-)**: This subpopulation lacks antigen X.\n    - The applicable kill rate is $k = 0\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$.\n    - The effective growth rate is $r_{\\text{eff,3,CAR}} = r - 0 = 0.2\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$.\n    - Since $r_{\\text{eff,3,CAR}} > 0$, this subpopulation will grow.\n\n**Outcome for CAR Therapy**: Both antigen X-positive subpopulations, constituting $90\\%$ of the initial tumor mass, are targeted and shrink. This will result in a significant initial tumor regression, qualifying as an objective clinical response. However, the pre-existing $10\\%$ antigen X-negative subpopulation is inherently resistant and will continue to grow, eventually leading to clinical relapse with a tumor that is completely antigen X-negative.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. TCR-engineered T cells will fail to induce objective responses because most tumor cells are MHC class I negative; CAR T cells will induce a significant initial tumor regression by killing antigen X-positive cells regardless of MHC class I status, but relapse will occur via outgrowth of the antigen X-negative subpopulation.**\n- This statement accurately summarizes the derived outcomes. The TCR therapy fails due to the large MHC class I-negative population ($60\\%$). The CAR therapy succeeds initially by targeting all antigen X-positive cells ($90\\%$) but eventually fails due to the selective expansion of the antigen-negative clone ($10\\%$).\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. TCR-engineered T cells will outperform CAR T cells because their higher per-capita kill rate will drive a durable remission across the entire tumor despite MHC class I loss.**\n- This is incorrect. The higher kill rate of TCR T-cells ($k_{\\text{TCR}} = 0.5\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$) is irrelevant as it applies to only $30\\%$ of the tumor. CAR T-cell therapy is far more effective initially, targeting $90\\%$ of the tumor. TCR therapy does not drive remission; it fails because of MHC class I loss, not despite it.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Both therapies will fail equally because antigen presentation on MHC class I is required for recognition by both TCR-engineered T cells and CAR T cells.**\n- This is incorrect. The fundamental premise that CAR T cells require MHC class I is false and contradicts the problem statement. The outcomes are also not equal; CAR T cells induce a significant initial response, while TCR T cells do not.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. CAR T cells will be ineffective because target peptides are not presented on MHC class I, whereas TCR-engineered T cells will remain effective by recognizing the native surface antigen X.**\n- This statement incorrectly swaps the recognition mechanisms of CAR T cells and TCR T cells. CARs recognize native antigen, and TCRs recognize peptide-MHC complexes.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. TCR-engineered T cells will indirectly cure the tumor by provoking Natural Killer cell clearance of MHC class I negative cells, whereas CAR T cells will not, resulting in superior durability for TCR therapy despite the MHC class I loss.**\n- This is incorrect. The problem explicitly states to \"Ignore effects from other immune compartments\". Introducing the role of Natural Killer (NK) cells violates this constraint. The conclusion must be drawn only from the provided model.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2831318"}]}
