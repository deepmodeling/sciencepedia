All parameters necessary for a unique solution are provided, and no contradictions are present. The language is objective and precise. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nI will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state probability of ITAM phosphorylation, which we denote as $p$. This probability represents the fraction of total ITAMs on activating CARs that are in a phosphorylated state at steady state. Let $I_{p}$ and $I_{u}$ represent the number of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated ITAMs, respectively. The evolution of the fraction of phosphorylated ITAMs, $p = \\frac{I_p}{I_p + I_u}$, is described by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dt} = k_{f} (1 - p) - k_{r} p $$\nwhere $k_{f}$ is the total phosphorylation rate constant and $k_{r}$ is the total dephosphorylation rate constant. This equation follows from linear mass-action kinetics, where the rate of phosphorylation is proportional to the fraction of unphosphorylated sites, $(1-p)$, and the rate of dephosphorylation is proportional to the fraction of phosphorylated sites, $p$.\n\nAt steady state, $\\frac{dp}{dt} = 0$. This gives:\n$$ k_{f} (1 - p_{ss}) = k_{r} p_{ss} $$\nSolving for the steady-state fraction $p_{ss}$:\n$$ k_{f} = k_{f} p_{ss} + k_{r} p_{ss} = (k_{f} + k_{r}) p_{ss} $$\n$$ p_{ss} = \\frac{k_{f}}{k_{f} + k_{r}} $$\n\nThe problem states that the total phosphorylation rate is proportional to the number of engaged activating CARs, $N_{A}$. Each engaged CAR contributes a rate constant $k_p$. Thus, the total phosphorylation rate constant is:\n$$ k_{f} = k_{p} N_{A} $$\nThe total dephosphorylation rate includes a basal component $k_{0}$ and a component proportional to the number of engaged iCARs, $N_{I}$. Each engaged iCAR contributes a rate constant $k_d$. Thus, the total dephosphorylation rate constant is:\n$$ k_{r} = k_{0} + k_{d} N_{I} $$\n\nThe number of engaged receptors is determined by the ligand concentration $L$ and the dissociation constant $K_d$.
