The problem states that a total dose of $D$ physical particles is administered, and a fraction $\\epsilon$ of these particles effectively reach and productively enter target cells. Therefore, the total number of effective infectious particles is the product of the total dose and this effective fraction:\n$$\nN_{\\text{inf}} = \\epsilon D\n$$\nThe denominator, $N_{\\text{cell}}$, is the total number of target cells in the tissue compartment. The problem provides that the total number of target cells is the product of the tissue volume, $V$, and the target cell density, $\\rho$. Thus:\n$$\nN_{\\text{cell}} = \\rho V\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $N_{\\text{inf}}$ and $N_{\\text{cell}}$ into the equation for $\\lambda$, we obtain the general expression for the multiplicity of infection:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\epsilon D}{\\rho V}\n$$\nThis expression represents the mean of the Poisson distribution that models the number of infectious particles received by any given cell, which is consistent with the problem statement.

In this design exercise for an AAV-based viral vector vaccine platform, you are tasked with evaluating the feasibility of packaging a large antigen expression cassette and, if it does not fit, assessing a conceptually sound alternative rooted in multi-vector strategies.\n\nUse the following fundamental and well-established facts:\n- Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has a practical genome packaging limit of $4.7$ kb that includes both inverted terminal repeats (ITRs).\n- Each inverted terminal repeat (ITR) is $0.145$ kb.\n- The expression cassette comprises a promoter, a coding sequence, and a polyadenylation signal.\n- Homologous recombination (HR)-based dual-vector or multi-vector AAV strategies require an overlap between adjacent vectors to reconstitute the full-length expression cassette in transduced cells.\n\nYou are given an initial cassette totaling $6.5$ kb composed of a promoter of $1.2$ kb, a coding sequence of $4.9$ kb, and a polyadenylation signal of $0.4$ kb. You may miniaturize the promoter to $0.3$ kb and the polyadenylation signal to $0.1$ kb without altering the coding sequence. Consider the following design path:\n\n1. Starting from the fact that the $4.7$ kb AAV limit includes the two ITRs, derive the maximal length available for the expression cassette between ITRs. State this limit in kilobases.\n2.

If it does not fit, compute by first principles the promoter length that would be theoretically required to fit, and comment on feasibility purely by comparing lengths.\n3. As a conceptually sound alternative, consider an $N$-vector homologous recombination strategy in which:\n   - Only the first vector carries the promoter, only the last vector carries the polyadenylation signal, and the coding sequence is partitioned across all $N$ vectors.\n   - Each adjacent pair of vectors shares a homologous overlap of $0.4$ kb that is present in both of the two vectors that meet at that junction.\n   - All vectors must individually satisfy the between-ITR capacity derived in part 1.\n\nStarting from these constraints, derive an expression for the minimal possible value of the maximum per-vector between-ITR content, as a function of $N$, the promoter length $p$, coding length $c$, polyadenylation length $a$, and overlap $o$. Then, using $p=0.3$ kb, $c=4.9$ kb, $a=0.1$ kb, and $o=0.4$ kb, determine the smallest integer $N$ for which an $N$-vector design is feasible under the AAV capacity constraint from part 1.

This limit includes the two inverted terminal repeats (ITRs). The length of a single ITR, $L_{\\text{ITR}}$, is $0.145$ kb. The space available for the expression cassette is the region between the two ITRs. The maximum permissible length for the cassette, $L_{\\text{cassette,max}}$, is therefore the total capacity minus the length of two ITRs.\n$$L_{\\text{cassette,max}} = L_{\\text{total}} - 2 \\times L_{\\text{ITR}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$L_{\\text{cassette,max}} = 4.7~\\text{kb} - 2 \\times 0.145~\\text{kb} = 4.7~\\text{kb} - 0.29~\\text{kb} = 4.41~\\text{kb}$$\nThis is the absolute upper limit for any genetic material packaged between the AAV ITRs.\n\n**Part 2: Feasibility of Miniaturized Single-Vector Design**\nThe miniaturized expression cassette consists of a promoter of length $p = 0.3$ kb, a coding sequence of length $c = 4.9$ kb, and a polyadenylation signal of length $a = 0.1$ kb. The total length of this miniaturized cassette, $L_{\\text{cassette,mini}}$, is the sum of its components:\n$$L_{\\text{cassette,mini}} = p + c + a = 0.3~\\text{kb} + 4.9~\\text{kb} + 0.1~\\text{kb} = 5.3~\\text{kb}$$\nTo determine if this design is feasible, we compare its total length to the maximum capacity derived in Part 1:\n$$L_{\\text{cassette,mini}} = 5.3~\\text{kb} > L_{\\text{cassette,max}} = 4.41~\\text{kb}$$\nThe miniaturized cassette exceeds the packaging capacity. Therefore, this single-vector design is not feasible.\n\nTo find the theoretical promoter length, $p_{\\text{req}}$, that would be required for the design to fit, we set the total cassette length to be at most the maximum capacity, keeping the coding sequence and polyadenylation signal lengths fixed:\n$$p_{\\text{req}} + c + a \\le L_{\\text{cassette,max}}$$\n$$p_{\\text{req}} + 4.9~\\text{kb} + 0.1~\\text{kb} \\le 4.41~\\text{kb}$$\n$$p_{\\text{req}} + 5.0~\\text{kb} \\le 4.41~\\text{kb}$$\n$$p_{\\text{req}} \\le 4.41~\\text{kb} - 5.0~\\text{kb}$$\n$$p_{\\text{req}} \\le -0.59~\\text{kb}$$\nA physical length cannot be negative.

Its payload length is $l_1 = p + |c'_1| + o$.\n-   **Vector $i$ ($1  i  N$):** A middle vector must have an overlap region at its 5' end to recombine with vector $i-1$ and another overlap at its 3' end to recombine with vector $i+1$. Its payload contains one unique coding segment flanked by two overlap regions. Its length is $l_i = o + |c'_i| + o = 2o + |c'_i|$.\n-   **Vector $N$:** Contains the final overlap region, the last unique coding segment, and the polyadenylation signal. Its payload length is $l_N = o + |c'_N| + a$.\n\nEach of these lengths, $l_i$, must be less than or equal to the maximum capacity, $l_i \\le L_{\\text{cassette,max}}$.\n\nTo find the minimal possible value of the maximum per-vector content, we must partition the coding sequence in a way that balances the load across all vectors. The optimal distribution that minimizes the maximum load is one where all loads are equal, i.e., $l_1 = l_2 = \\dots = l_N = L$. From this, we can express the lengths of the unique coding segments in terms of this balanced load $L$:\n-   $|c'_1| = L - p - o$\n-   $|c'_i| = L - 2o$ for $1  i  N$\n-   $|c'_N| = L - o - a$\n\nThe sum of these lengths must equal the total coding sequence length, $c$:\n$$c = \\sum_{i=1}^N |c'_i| = (L - p - o) + (N-2)(L - 2o) + (L - o - a)$$\nWe solve for $L$:\n$$c = L - p - o + (N-2)L - 2(N-2)o + L - o - a$$\n$$c = (1 + N-2 + 1)L - p - a - (o + 2(N-2)o + o)$$\n$$c = NL - p - a - (2o + 2No - 4o)$$\n$$c = NL - p - a - (2No - 2o)$$\n$$c = NL - p - a - 2o(N-1)$$\n$$NL = p + c + a + 2o(N-1)$$\n$$L = \\frac{p + c + a + 2o(N-1)}{N}$$\nThis expression for $L$ is a function of $N$ and represents the minimal possible value of the maximum per-vector content.\n\nFor the design to be feasible, this balanced load $L$ must not exceed the packaging capacity $L_{\\text{cassette,max}}$:\n$$L \\le L_{\\text{cassette,max}}$$\n$$\\frac{p + c + a + 2o(N-1)}{N} \\le L_{\\text{cassette,max}}$$\nSubstituting the given values ($p=0.3$, $c=4.9$, $a=0.1$, $o=0.4$, $L_{\\text{cassette,max}}=4.41$):\n$$\\frac{0.3 + 4.9 + 0.1 + 2(0.4)(N-1)}{N} \\le 4.41$$\n$$\\frac{5.3 + 0.8(N-1)}{N} \\le 4.41$$\n$$\\frac{5.3 + 0.8N - 0.8}{N} \\le 4.41$$\n$$\\frac{4.5 + 0.8N}{N} \\le 4.41$$\nSince $N$ must be a positive integer, we can multiply by $N$:\n$$4.5 + 0.8N \\le 4.41N$$\n$$4.5 \\le 4.41N - 0.8N$$\n$$4.5 \\le 3.61N$$\n$$N \\ge \\frac{4.5}{3.61} \\approx 1.2465$$\nSince the number of vectors $N$ must be an integer, the smallest integer value of $N$ that satisfies this condition is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2905454"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of a vaccine is to orchestrate a protective immune response, a complex process involving numerous interacting components.

This ratio quantifies the relative impact of proteasome inhibition and altered innate signaling on the magnitude of the T cell response.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the peak CD8+ T cell population ratio for several scenarios\n    by numerically solving a system of ordinary differential equations.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Globally fixed parameters as per the problem description.\n    N0 = 1.0\n    A0 = 1.0\n    DEFAULT_KA = 0.7  # day^-1\n    S0 = 1.5          # day^-1 per unit of normalized antigen\n    D0 = 0.4          # day^-1\n    ALPHA = 0.6       # unitless\n    T_END = 14.0      # days\n    DT = 0.01         # days\n\n    def simulate(p, i, k_a):\n        \"\"\"\n        Numerically integrates the T cell population dynamics using forward Euler\n        and returns the peak population size.\n\n        Args:\n            p (float): Proteasome efficiency factor [0, 1].\n            i (float): Innate signaling factor [0, 1].\n            k_a (float): Antigen decay rate (day^-1).\n\n        Returns:\n            float: The maximum T cell population size over the simulation.\n        \"\"\"\n        num_steps = int(T_END / DT)\n        t_values = np.linspace(0, T_END, num_steps + 1)\n        n_values = np.zeros(num_steps + 1)\n        n_values[0] = N0\n\n        # Pre-calculate the constant death rate for the simulation\n        k_death = D0 * (ALPHA + (1 - ALPHA) * i)\n\n        for j in range(num_steps):\n            t_j = t_values[j]\n            n_j = n_values[j]\n\n            # Calculate time-dependent stimulation rate\n            a_eff = p * A0 * np.exp(-k_a * t_j)\n            k_stim = S0 * i * a_eff\n\n            # Net per-capita growth rate\n            net_rate = k_stim - k_death\n\n            # Forward Euler update step\n            n_values[j+1] = n_j * (1 + DT * net_rate)\n\n            # A guard against non-physical negative populations, although\n            # unlikely for the given parameter ranges.\n            if n_values[j+1]  0:\n                n_values[j+1] = 0.0\n\n        return np.max(n_values)\n\n    # Test suite from the problem statement.\n    # Format: (p, i, k_a) where k_a is optional and defaults to DEFAULT_KA.\n    test_cases_spec = [\n        (1.0, 1.0),         # Case 1 (baseline control)\n        (0.5, 1.0),         # Case 2 (moderate proteasome inhibition)\n        (0.2, 1.0),         # Case 3 (severe proteasome inhibition)\n        (0.5, 0.7),         # Case 4 (moderate PI with mild innate reduction)\n        (0.5, 0.3),         # Case 5 (moderate PI with strong innate reduction)\n        (0.0, 1.0),         # Case 6 (complete proteasome blockade)\n        (1.0, 0.0),         # Case 7 (innate signaling abrogated, no PI)\n        (0.5, 0.7, 0.3),    # Case 8 (as Case 4, but slower antigen decay)\n    ]\n\n    # Process specifications into full (p, i, k_a) tuples for simulation.\n    test_cases = []\n    for case in test_cases_spec:\n        if len(case) == 2:\n            test_cases.append((case[0], case[1], DEFAULT_KA))\n        else:\n            test_cases.append(case)\n\n    # Calculate the peak population for the baseline control case (Case 1).\n    p_baseline, i_baseline, ka_baseline = test_cases[0]\n    n_max_baseline = simulate(p_baseline, i_baseline, ka_baseline)\n\n    ratios = []\n    for p, i, k_a in test_cases:\n        n_max_case = simulate(p, i, k_a)\n        if n_max_baseline > 0:\n            ratio = n_max_case / n_max_baseline\n        else: # Avoid division by zero, though baseline max should be > 1.0\n            ratio = 0.0 if n_max_case > 0 else 1.0\n        ratios.append(f\"{ratio:.6f}\") # Format to exactly six decimal places.\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(ratios)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2905494"}]}
