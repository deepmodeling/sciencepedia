This practice explores a fundamental step in this process: quantifying the physical accessibility of target residues on a viral protein.

In the rolling-probe model of solvent exposure used in structural vaccinology, the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of a residue is determined by the surface area that remains accessible to a spherical solvent probe of radius $r_p$ as it rolls over the protein. Model each targeted residue as a sphere of effective radius $r_i$ (representing the local side-chain envelope). The maximum solvent-exposed area for a fully exposed residue is the surface area of a sphere of radius $R_i = r_i + r_p$. In the intact trimer, local occlusion by neighboring protein elements and glycan shielding reduce exposure. Let $f_i$ be the fraction of surface points occluded by protein-protein contacts and $g_i$ be the fraction occluded by glycans, and assume these two processes act independently so that the accessible fraction is $a_i = (1 - f_i)(1 - g_i)$. Thus the SASA of residue $i$ is $A_i = 4 \\pi R_i^2 a_i$.\n\nIn systems vaccinology, the initial B cell receptor (BCR) engagement potential of a neutralizing epitope can be proxied by a weighted accessibility index $E = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} w_i A_i$, where $w_i$ are paratope complementarity weights inferred from deep mutational scanning of antibody contact preferences and normalized so that $\\sum_{i=1}^{5} w_i = 1$.\n\nFor a solvent probe radius $r_p = 0.14$ nm, compute the weighted accessibility index $E$ in $\\text{nm}^2$ for the following residues, and then briefly explain how accessibility mechanistically relates to immunogenicity and BCR engagement in the context of rational vaccine design.

An effective antibody response begins with the physical engagement of a B cell receptor (BCR) on a naive B cell with its cognate epitope on an antigen.\n1.  **BCR Engagement**: The BCR is a large, membrane-anchored antibody molecule. For binding to occur, the epitope must be physically accessible to the binding site (paratope) of the BCR. An epitope that is buried within the interior of a protein or sterically occluded by neighboring structural elements or post-translational modifications, such as dense glycosylation (a \"glycan shield\"), is inaccessible. Such an epitope is effectively invisible to the patrolling B cell repertoire.\n2.  **Immunogenicity**: An epitope's immunogenicity, its capacity to elicit an immune response, is therefore critically dependent upon its accessibility. A high solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) increases the probability of a stochastic encounter and successful binding event with a B cell bearing a complementary BCR. This binding, along with T cell help, triggers B cell activation, clonal expansion, and entry into the germinal center reaction, where affinity maturation and class switching occur, ultimately producing high-affinity secreted antibodies and memory B cells.\n3.  **Rational Vaccine Design**: The principle of \"epitope focusing\" in rational vaccine design leverages this mechanism. Scientists aim to engineer immunogens that present conserved, neutralizing epitopes with maximal accessibility. Conversely, immunodominant but non-neutralizing or strain-specific epitopes may be deliberately occluded or removed. The metric $E$ calculated in this problem is a quantitative proxy for this \"immunogenic potential.\" It refines the simple SASA concept by weighting the contribution of each residue's accessibility ($A_i$) by its importance to antibody binding ($w_i$), providing a more sophisticated tool for computationally evaluating and optimizing vaccine candidates before expensive and time-consuming experimental testing. By maximizing this index for a target neutralizing epitope, one aims to direct the immune response toward producing the desired functional antibodies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.129}$$", "id": "2892930"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the immunogen itself, the vaccine's delivery system and adjuvant components are critical for shaping the resulting immune response.

It describes a standard preclinical experiment in immunology and drug delivery. The provided formulation details and foundational facts are consistent with established scientific principles. The problem is self-contained and provides sufficient information to derive a logical conclusion. There are no contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities. The terminology is precise and standard for the field.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. Proceeding to solution derivation.\n\n**Principle-Based Derivation**\n\nThe task is to predict the dominant innate immune signaling pathways and the resulting transcriptomic signature based on the given formulation. This requires a systematic analysis of the interactions between the LNP-mRNA components and the innate immune system, guided by the provided foundational facts.\n\n1.  **Cargo-Sensor Interactions**:\n    - The mRNA cargo is specified as containing **unmodified uridine**. This makes it a potent agonist for endosomal **TLR$7$** (in mice), which signals through MyD$88$ to activate both **NF-$\\kappa$B** and **IRF$7$**.\n    - The mRNA is stated to be **capped**. This means it possesses a $5'$-cap structure, not a $5'$-triphosphate end. As RIG-I sensing is dependent on $5'$-triphosphate, significant **RIG-I** activation is not expected.\n    - The cargo is **not HPLC-purified** and contains **dsRNA byproducts**. This dsRNA serves as a ligand for endosomal **TLR$3$** (signaling via TRIF to activate **NF-$\\kappa$B** and **IRF$3$**) and potentially for cytosolic **MDA$5$** if it escapes the endosome (also activating NF-$\\kappa$B and IRF$3$).\n    - The cargo is RNA, not DNA. Therefore, activation of the cytosolic DNA sensor **cGAS** and its downstream STING pathway is not expected.\n\n2.  **LNP-Mediated Effects**:\n    - The LNP contains **DSPC** as the helper phospholipid. As per the foundational facts, DSPC increases bilayer rigidity and promotes **longer endosomal residence time**. This property is critical, as it enhances the probability and duration of interaction between the RNA cargo (ssRNA and dsRNA) and the endosomal TLRs (TLR$7$ and TLR$3$).\n    - The ionizable lipid has a p$K_a$ of approximately **$6.7$**. As the endosome acidifies (pH drops from ~$7.4$ to ~$6.5$ and lower), this lipid will become protonated and cationic. A p$K_a$ of $6.7$ is relatively high, leading to strong membrane interactions and, as stated, **endosomal perturbation**. This perturbation, a form of endolysosomal stress, is a known activator (Signal $2$) for the **NLRP$3$ inflammasome**.\n    - For NLRP$3$ to be activated, it first requires priming (Signal $1$), which involves the NF-$\\kappa$B-dependent transcriptional upregulation of *Nlrp3* and *Il1b*. As established above, TLR$7$ and TLR$3$ activation will robustly drive NF-$\\kappa$B, thus providing the necessary priming signal.\n\n3.  **Synthesis of Transcriptomic Signature**\n    - The combined activation of TLR$7$ (MyD$88$) and TLR$3$ (TRIF) pathways will lead to the potent activation of all relevant transcription factors: **NF-$\\kappa$B**, **IRF$3$**, and **IRF$7$**.\n    - **NF-$\\kappa$B activation** will drive the expression of a broad set of pro-inflammatory genes, including cytokines like *Tnf* and *Il6*, chemokines for recruiting myeloid cells like *Ccl2*, *Cxcl1*, and *Cxcl2*, and inflammasome components like *Il1b* and *Nlrp3*.\n    - **IRF$3$/IRF$7$ activation** will drive a strong Type I interferon response module, characterized by upregulation of *Ifnb1* (encoding IFN-$\\beta$) and a wide array of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as *Isg15*, *Oas1*, *Ifit1*, and the IRF-dependent chemokine *Cxcl10*.\n    - The priming by NF-$\\kappa$B and subsequent activation of NLRP$3$ by the LNP itself will lead to Caspase-$1$ activation. At the transcriptomic level, this is reflected by the upregulation of *Il1b*, *Nlrp3*, and *Casp1*.\n\nThe overall prediction is therefore a broad, potent, mixed inflammatory signature involving strong NF-$\\kappa$B-driven inflammation, a robust Type I interferon response, and activation of the NLRP$3$ inflammasome pathway. The cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway will be silent.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Predominant endosomal TLR$7/8$ engagement by uridine-rich single-stranded ribonucleic acid and TLR$3$ sensing of double-stranded ribonucleic acid, with additional NLRP$3$ inflammasome priming due to cationic lipid–induced endolysosomal stress. Expect broad NF-$\\kappa$B and IRF$3/7$ programs: upregulation of *Tnf*, *Il6*, *Ccl2*, *Il1b*, *Nlrp3*, *Casp1*, neutrophil and monocyte chemokines (for example, *Cxcl1*/*Cxcl2*), and type I interferon modules including *Ifnb1*, *Isg15*, *Oas1*, *Ifit1*, and *Cxcl10*; minimal cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase–Stimulator of Interferon Genes (cGAS–STING) DNA-sensing signature.**\n- **Evaluation**: This option correctly identifies the key sensors (TLR$7$, TLR$3$, NLRP$3$), the driving molecular features of the formulation (unmodified uridine, dsRNA, high p$K_a$ lipid), and the resulting downstream pathways (NF-$\\kappa$B, IRF$3$/$7$). The predicted transcriptomic signature, including both pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and a Type I interferon module, with specific and appropriate gene examples, is fully consistent with the derivation. The exclusion of the cGAS-STING pathway is also correct.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Predominant cGAS–STING activation by cytosolic deoxyribonucleic acid, yielding an interferon-only state with high *Ccl5*, *Ifnb1*, and *Tbk1* but little to no NF-$\\kappa$B cytokines (*Tnf*, *Il6*) or *Il1b*, and minimal interferon-stimulated gene induction at $6$–$24$ hours.**\n- **Evaluation**: This option is fundamentally flawed. First, cGAS detects dsDNA, not the mRNA cargo specified in the problem. Second, the STING pathway activates both IRF$3$ and NF-$\\kappa$B, making an \"interferon-only state\" an incorrect description. Third, it nonsensically claims high *Ifnb1* expression with \"minimal interferon-stimulated gene induction,\" which is a direct contradiction, as IFN-$\\beta$ is the primary inducer of ISGs.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Minimal innate activation due to rapid endosomal escape and poor uptake: limited chemokine induction without cytokines or interferon-stimulated genes, because PEG-lipid at $5\\%$ and fusogenic $1,2$-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-$3$-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) prevent endosomal TLR access and the nucleoside-modified, HPLC-purified mRNA avoids TLR$7/8$ and RIG-I/MDA$5$ sensing.**\n- **Evaluation**: This option describes a formulation and outcome that are diametrically opposed to the problem statement. It incorrectly assumes: PEG-lipid at $5\\%$ (given as $2.5\\%$), the presence of DOPE (given as DSPC), nucleoside-modified mRNA (given as unmodified), and HPLC-purified mRNA (given as not purified). Each of these false premises points toward an opposing \"silent\" LNP platform, which is not what was described. The given formulation is highly immunostimulatory, not minimal.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Exclusive cytosolic RIG-I activation by $5'$-triphosphate ends on the delivered mRNA, resulting in a pure interferon-stimulated gene signature (for example, *Ifit1*, *Isg15*, *Oas1*) without NF-$\\kappa$B-driven cytokines or inflammasome-related transcripts, and no involvement of endosomal TLRs at $6$–$24$ hours.**\n- **Evaluation**: This option is incorrect on several grounds. First, it posits \"exclusive\" RIG-I activation, ignoring that the mRNA is \"capped,\" which prevents RIG-I sensing. Second, it incorrectly claims a \"pure\" ISG signature without NF-$\\kappa$B, whereas the RIG-I pathway itself also activates NF-$\\kappa$B. Third, it completely disregards the major stimuli provided in the problem: the unmodified uridine (for TLR$7$), the dsRNA (for TLR$3$/MDA$5$), the DSPC lipid promoting endosomal sensing, and the high p$K_a$ lipid activating NLRP$3$.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2892933"}, {"introduction": "The success of a vaccine is ultimately measured by the quality and functionality of the adaptive immunity it elicits. For antibody-based protection, this means not just the quantity of antibodies, but their specific functional characteristics. This practice delves into the crucial role of antibody effector functions by asking you to compare how different vaccine-induced Immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass and Fc glycoform profiles translate into the ability to mediate Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC), a key mechanism for clearing infected cells [@problem_id:2892870].", "problem": "A vaccinology team compares two adjuvanted formulations that elicit different Immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass and Fc glycoform profiles against the same antigen, with the goal of maximizing Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC). Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) is mediated primarily by Fc gamma receptor IIIa (Fc$\\gamma$RIIIa) on Natural Killer (NK) cells. The team measures the antigen-specific IgG concentration to be equal across cohorts at day $28$ post-boost, namely $10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ in serum for both cohorts. They quantify subclass proportions and the fraction of afucosylated Fc glycans within each subclass, and they compile the following biophysical parameters for binding to Fc$\\gamma$RIIIa (V158 allotype) at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ for fucosylated IgG: IgG1 has $K_d=3.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, IgG3 has $K_d=1.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, IgG2 has $K_d=25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, and IgG4 has $K_d=10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. Consistent with the literature, afucosylation of the Fc N-linked glycan reduces $K_d$ by approximately $20$-fold for IgG1 and IgG3, and by approximately $10$-fold for IgG2 and IgG4, relative to their fucosylated counterparts. Assume monovalent receptor-ligand interaction per IgG Fc, no avidity or clustering effects beyond simple binding, and that other glycan features (e.g., galactosylation, sialylation, bisecting $N$-acetylglucosamine) are similar between cohorts and can be ignored for this comparison.\n\nCohort A yields the following antigen-specific IgG subclass proportions and afucosylation fractions: IgG1 $60\\%$ with $20\\%$ afucosylated, IgG3 $20\\%$ with $40\\%$ afucosylated, IgG2 $15\\%$ with $5\\%$ afucosylated, and IgG4 $5\\%$ with $10\\%$ afucosylated.

Cohort A will produce approximately a $3$-fold higher Fc$\\gamma$RIIIa engagement than Cohort B and thus higher ADCC, driven primarily by the higher IgG3 fraction and greater afucosylation of IgG1 and IgG3 in Cohort A at the same $10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ antigen-specific IgG concentration.\n\nB.

Cohort A will have lower Fc$\\gamma$RIIIa binding than Cohort B because afucosylation reduces Fc$\\gamma$RIIIa affinity, leading to reduced ADCC in Cohort A.", "solution": "The problem requires a quantitative comparison of Fc$\\gamma$RIIIa receptor engagement by two different mixtures of antigen-specific antibodies, produced by Cohort A and Cohort B. The engagement is a function of the concentration of each antibody species and its corresponding affinity for the receptor.\n\nFirst, the validity of the problem statement is confirmed. The premises are scientifically sound, the data provided is quantitative and self-consistent, and the question is well-posed, allowing for a solution based on the principles of receptor-ligand binding.\n\nThe central principle for solving this problem is the law of mass action applied to a system with multiple ligands competing for a single receptor. The total fractional occupancy of the receptor, $\\theta_{\\text{total}}$, in a mixture of ligands $L_i$ with concentrations $[L_i]$ and dissociation constants $K_{d,i}$ is given by:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{\\sum_i \\frac{[L_i]}{K_{d,i}}}{1 + \\sum_i \\frac{[L_i]}{K_{d,i}}} $$\nThe total concentration of bound receptor-ligand complexes is $[RL]_{\\text{total}} = [R]_{\\text{total}} \\theta_{\\text{total}}$, where $[R]_{\\text{total}}$ is the total receptor concentration on the NK cells.\n\nThe problem states that the total antigen-specific IgG concentration, $[\\text{IgG}]_{\\text{total}}$, is $10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ for both cohorts. The dissociation constants, $K_d$, for all relevant IgG species are in the range of $75\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ to $25000\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. Since the total ligand concentration ($10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$) is substantially lower than even the lowest $K_d$ value ($K_{d,3}^{\\text{afuc}} = 75\\,\\mathrm{nM}$), the system is far from saturation. This condition, $\\sum_i [L_i] \\ll K_{d,i}$ for most species, allows for a simplification. The term $\\sum_i \\frac{[L_i]}{K_{d,i}}$ in the denominator is much less than $1$. Therefore, the total receptor occupancy is approximately proportional to this sum:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{total}} \\approx \\sum_i \\frac{[L_i]}{K_{d,i}} $$\nTo compare the relative Fc$\\gamma$RIIIa engagement between the two cohorts, we can compute and compare a \"Binding Score,\" $S$, for each cohort, where $S = \\sum_i \\frac{[L_i]}{K_{d,i}}$.\n\nFirst, let us tabulate the dissociation constants ($K_d$ in $\\mathrm{nM}$) for all IgG species.\n-   IgG1: $K_{d,1}^{\\text{fuc}} = 3000\\,\\mathrm{nM}$; $K_{d,1}^{\\text{afuc}} = \\frac{3000}{20} = 150\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n-   IgG3: $K_{d,3}^{\\text{fuc}} = 1500\\,\\mathrm{nM}$; $K_{d,3}^{\\text{afuc}} = \\frac{1500}{20} = 75\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n-   IgG2: $K_{d,2}^{\\text{fuc}} = 25000\\,\\mathrm{nM}$; $K_{d,2}^{\\text{afuc}} = \\frac{25000}{10} = 2500\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n-   IgG4: $K_{d,4}^{\\text{fuc}} = 10000\\,\\mathrm{nM}$; $K_{d,4}^{\\text{afuc}} = \\frac{10000}{10} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\nNext, we calculate the concentrations of each IgG species for each cohort, based on the total concentration $[\\text{IgG}]_{\\text{total}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\n**Cohort A Calculations:**\n-   IgG1 ($60\\%$): Total conc. $= 0.60 \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 6\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n    -   Afucosylated (afuc): $[\\text{IgG1, afuc}]_A = 0.20 \\times 6\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n    -   Fucosylated (fuc): $[\\text{IgG1, fuc}]_A = 0.80 \\times 6\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 4.8\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n-   IgG3 ($20\\%$): Total conc. $= 0.20 \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 2\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n    -   Afuc: $[\\text{IgG3, afuc}]_A = 0.40 \\times 2\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n    -   Fuc: $[\\text{IgG3, fuc}]_A = 0.60 \\times 2\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n-   IgG2 ($15\\%$): Total conc. $= 0.15 \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n    -   Afuc: $[\\text{IgG2, afuc}]_A = 0.05 \\times 1.5\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 0.075\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n-   IgG4 ($5\\%$): Total conc. $= 0.05 \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n    -   Afuc: $[\\text{IgG4, afuc}]_A = 0.10 \\times 0.5\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nThe Binding Score for Cohort A ($S_A$) is the sum of each species' concentration divided by its $K_d$.

This significant increase in receptor engagement is expected to result in substantially higher ADCC potential. The main drivers for this difference are the higher concentration of high-affinity IgG3 in Cohort A ($2\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ vs $1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$) and, critically, the much larger fraction of afucosylated IgG1 and IgG3, which possess $20$-fold higher affinity.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\nA.

Cohort B will produce higher Fc$\\gamma$RIIIa engagement than Cohort A because its higher IgG1 proportion dominates binding; differences in afucosylation are negligible at $10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n- Our calculation shows Cohort A has higher engagement, not Cohort B. The higher IgG1 proportion in B is insufficient to overcome the higher affinity profile of Cohort A.

Fc$\\gamma$RIIIa is effectively saturated at $10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ antigen-specific IgG regardless of subclass or glycoform, so both cohorts will have similar engagement and ADCC.\n- The total IgG concentration ($10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$) is much lower than all relevant $K_d$ values (starting from $75\\,\\mathrm{nM}$). The receptor is far from saturated. Consequently, engagement is highly dependent on the antibody mixture, and the engagement is not similar between cohorts. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Cohort A will show only a modest increase (about $1.6$-fold) in Fc$\\gamma$RIIIa engagement relative to Cohort B, mainly due to its higher IgG1 content rather than afucosylation, so ADCC will be only slightly higher in Cohort A.\n- The calculated increase is $\\sim 3.25$-fold, not a \"modest\" $1.6$-fold. Furthermore, Cohort A has a lower IgG1 content ($60\\%$) than Cohort B ($70\\%$), and the effect is driven primarily by afucosylation, contrary to what is stated. **Incorrect**.\n\nE. Cohort A will have lower Fc$\\gamma$RIIIa binding than Cohort B because afucosylation reduces Fc$\\gamma$RIIIa affinity, leading to reduced ADCC in Cohort A.\n- Cohort A has higher, not lower, binding.
