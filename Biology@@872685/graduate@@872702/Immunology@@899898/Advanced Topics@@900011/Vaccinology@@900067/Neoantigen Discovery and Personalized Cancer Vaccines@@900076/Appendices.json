Before we can identify neoantigens, we must first interpret the raw sequencing data to understand the tumor's genetic landscape.

By deriving the VAF from first principles, you will gain a deeper understanding of how it is influenced by tumor purity and genomic copy number alterations.", "problem": "A bulk tumor biopsy comprises a mixture of malignant and non-malignant cells. Tumor purity is the fraction of malignant cells in the specimen. Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) is defined as the expected fraction of sequencing reads at a genomic locus that carry a specific mutant allele. Consider a single-nucleotide variant (SNV) that is clonal (present in all malignant cells) and heterozygous within the malignant cells. Assume the following baseline conditions: the locus is diploid in both malignant and non-malignant compartments, the mutant allele is present on exactly one of the two chromosomal copies in every malignant cell, and there is no allelic bias or sequencing bias so that sequencing reads are sampled in proportion to chromosomal copy counts contributed by each compartment.\n\nGiven tumor purity $p = 0.60$ under these baseline conditions, use first principles (mixture of malignant and non-malignant compartments contributing chromosomal copies in proportion to their cellular fractions and locus copy numbers) to derive the expected VAF at this locus and then evaluate it numerically. Report your final numerical answer as a decimal fraction with no units, rounded to four significant figures.\n\nThen, using the same first-principles reasoning, generalize the expression for the expected VAF to the case where the malignant compartment has an arbitrary total locus copy number $C_{\\mathrm{tumor}} \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and the mutant allele has multiplicity $m \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots,C_{\\mathrm{tumor}}\\}$ in malignant cells, while the non-malignant compartment remains diploid with total locus copy number $C_{\\mathrm{normal}}=2$.

Do not include this discussion in your final numeric answer.", "solution": "We begin from definitions and a mixture model. Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) at a locus is the expected fraction of sequencing reads carrying the mutant allele. Under the assumptions stated, sequencing reads are sampled proportionally to the number of chromosomal copies present for that locus, contributed by the malignant and non-malignant compartments in proportion to their cellular fractions. Let the tumor purity be $p \\in [0,1]$, so the non-malignant fraction is $1-p$.\n\nBaseline scenario. The locus is diploid in both compartments, and the SNV is clonal and heterozygous in malignant cells. Thus:\n- Malignant cells contribute $C_{\\mathrm{tumor}}=2$ total locus copies per cell, of which $m=1$ carry the mutant allele (heterozygous).\n- Non-malignant cells contribute $C_{\\mathrm{normal}}=2$ total locus copies per cell, with $0$ mutant copies.\n\nIn an idealized large-sample limit (no sampling noise), the expected total number of locus copies in the mixture is proportional to\n$$\n\\text{Total copies} \\propto p \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{tumor}} + (1-p) \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{normal}}.\n$$\nThe expected number of mutant copies is proportional to\n$$\n\\text{Mutant copies} \\propto p \\cdot m + (1-p) \\cdot 0 = p \\cdot m.\n$$\nTherefore, by definition,\n$$\n\\mathrm{VAF} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{Mutant copies}}{\\text{Total copies}} \\;=\\; \\frac{p \\cdot m}{p \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{tumor}} + (1-p) \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{normal}}}.\n$$\n\nUnder the baseline conditions, $C_{\\mathrm{tumor}}=2$, $m=1$, $C_{\\mathrm{normal}}=2$.

If the malignant compartment undergoes a copy number alteration (CNA) at this locus, the malignant total copy number becomes an arbitrary integer $C_{\\mathrm{tumor}} \\in \\mathbb{N}$, and the mutant allele multiplicity is $m \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots,C_{\\mathrm{tumor}}\\}$.

Illustrative cases:\n- Copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) with duplication of the mutant allele: $C_{\\mathrm{tumor}}=2$, $m=2$. Then\n$$\n\\mathrm{VAF} \\;=\\; \\frac{p \\cdot 2}{p \\cdot 2 + (1-p)\\cdot 2} \\;=\\; p,\n$$\nwhich exceeds the baseline $\\frac{p}{2}$.\n- Hemizygous deletion retaining the mutant allele: $C_{\\mathrm{tumor}}=1$, $m=1$. Then\n$$\n\\mathrm{VAF} \\;=\\; \\frac{p \\cdot 1}{p \\cdot 1 + (1-p)\\cdot 2},\n$$\nwhich, for $p=0.60$, evaluates to $\\frac{0.60}{0.60+0.80}= \\frac{0.60}{1.40}$, higher than the baseline $0.30$.\n- Amplification with a single mutant copy: $C_{\\mathrm{tumor}}=4$, $m=1$. Then\n$$\n\\mathrm{VAF} \\;=\\; \\frac{p \\cdot 1}{p \\cdot 4 + (1-p)\\cdot 2},\n$$\nwhich is lower than the baseline $0.30$ at $p=0.60$ because the denominator increases more than the numerator.\n\nThus, the expected VAF increases with higher mutant multiplicity $m$ (e.g., LOH or duplication of the mutant allele) and decreases with higher $C_{\\mathrm{tumor}}$ when $m$ does not increase proportionally (e.g., amplifications of the wild-type allele or overall locus amplification with a single mutant copy).

We seek the feasible combination with the highest total score. We can test combinations in descending order of their total score.\n\nThe candidates sorted by score are: $n_1 (s_1=9), n_2 (s_2=8), n_3 (s_3=7), n_4 (s_4=6), n_5 (s_5=5), n_6 (s_6=4), n_7 (s_7=3)$.\n\nLet us first summarize the binding data:\n- $n_1 (9)$: Class I: $\\{\\text{A*02:01}, \\text{B*07:02}\\}$, Class II: $\\emptyset$\n- $n_2 (8)$: Class I: $\\{\\text{A*02:01}, \\text{C*07:02}\\}$, Class II: $\\{\\text{DRB1*04:01}\\}$\n- $n_3 (7)$: Class I: $\\{\\text{B*07:02}\\}$, Class II: $\\{\\text{DPB1*04:01}\\}$\n- $n_4 (6)$: Class I: $\\{\\text{C*07:02}\\}$, Class II: $\\emptyset$\n- $n_5 (5)$: Class I: $\\{\\text{A*02:01}\\}$, Class II: $\\{\\text{DRB1*04:01}, \\text{DPB1*04:01}\\}$\n- $n_6 (4)$: Class I: $\\{\\text{B*07:02}, \\text{C*07:02}\\}$, Class II: $\\emptyset$\n- $n_7 (3)$: Class I: $\\emptyset$, Class II: $\\{\\text{DPB1*04:01}\\}$\n\nThe highest possible score is from the combination of the top three candidates: $\\{n_1, n_2, n_3\\}$.\n- **Combination:** $\\{n_1, n_2, n_3\\}$\n- **Total Score:** $s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = 9 + 8 + 7 = 24$.\n- **Check Feasibility:**\n  - **Class I Allele Coverage**:\n    - $n_1$ covers $\\{\\text{A*02:01}, \\text{B*07:02}\\}$.\n    - $n_2$ covers $\\{\\text{A*02:01}, \\text{C*07:02}\\}$.\n    - $n_3$ covers $\\{\\text{B*07:02}\\}$.\n    - The union of covered Class I alleles is $\\{\\text{A*02:01}, \\text{B*07:02}, \\text{C*07:02}\\}$.\n    - The number of distinct covered Class I alleles is $3$. Since $3 \\ge 2$, this constraint is satisfied.\n  - **Class II Allele Coverage**:\n    - $n_1$ covers $\\emptyset$.\n    - $n_2$ covers $\\{\\text{DRB1*04:01}\\}$.\n    - $n_3$ covers $\\{\\text{DPB1*04:01}\\}$.\n    - The union of covered Class II alleles is $\\{\\text{DRB1*04:01}, \\text{DPB1*04:01}\\}$.\n    - The number of distinct covered Class II alleles is $2$. Since $2 \\ge 1$, this constraint is satisfied.\n\nThe combination $\\{n_1, n_2, n_3\\}$ is feasible and yields a total score of $24$. Any other combination of $3$ candidates must involve substituting at least one of $\\{n_1, n_2, n_3\\}$ with a candidate of a lower score. This would necessarily result in a total score strictly less than $24$. For example, the next highest-scoring combination, $\\{n_1, n_2, n_4\\}$, has a score of $9+8+6 = 23$. Since we have found a feasible solution with a score of $24$, this must be the maximum possible score.\n\nTherefore, the optimal objective value is $24$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{24}$$", "id": "2875592"}]}
