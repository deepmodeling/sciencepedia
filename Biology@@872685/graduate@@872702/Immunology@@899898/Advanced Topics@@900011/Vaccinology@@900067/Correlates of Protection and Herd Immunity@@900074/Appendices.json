The transmission potential of a vaccinated infected individual, $T_{\\text{vac}}$, is therefore:\n$$T_{\\text{vac}} = T_{\\text{unvac}} (1 - VE_T)$$\nThe vaccination coverage is $c$, meaning a fraction $c$ of the population is vaccinated and a fraction $1-c$ is unvaccinated. Due to the assumption of random vaccination and homogeneous mixing, a randomly chosen infected individual has a probability $c$ of being vaccinated and $1-c$ of being unvaccinated.\n\nThe population-average transmission potential, $T_{\\text{avg}}$, is the weighted average of the transmission potentials of the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups:\n$$T_{\\text{avg}} = (1-c) \\cdot T_{\\text{unvac}} + c \\cdot T_{\\text{vac}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $T_{\\text{vac}}$:\n$$T_{\\text{avg}} = (1-c) \\cdot T_{\\text{unvac}} + c \\cdot [T_{\\text{unvac}} (1 - VE_T)]$$\nFactor out $T_{\\text{unvac}}$:\n$$T_{\\text{avg}} = T_{\\text{unvac}} \\left[ (1-c) + c(1 - VE_T) \\right]$$\n$$T_{\\text{avg}} = T_{\\text{unvac}} [1 - c + c - c \\cdot VE_T]$$\n$$T_{\\text{avg}} = T_{\\text{unvac}} (1 - c \\cdot VE_T)$$\nThe effective reproduction number $R_e$ is $R_0$ scaled by the ratio of the current average transmission potential $T_{\\text{avg}}$ to the baseline potential $T_{\\text{unvac}}$:\n$$R_e = R_0 \\frac{T_{\\text{avg}}}{T_{\\text{unvac}}} = R_0 \\frac{T_{\\text{unvac}} (1 - c \\cdot VE_T)}{T_{\\text{unvac}}}$$\n$$R_e = R_0 (1 - c \\cdot VE_T)$$\nTo halt the epidemic spread, the effective reproduction number must be less than one, $R_e  1$.

A fraction $p \\in (0,1)$ of hosts carry $M$ and the remaining fraction $1-p$ do not. The biomarker $M$ is known to be a correlate of protection in the sense that, conditional on infection, it predicts a reduction in the duration of viral shedding without affecting the risk of acquiring infection upon exposure or the instantaneous per-contact infectiousness at any given time conditional on shedding. Assume random mixing, equal contact patterns across types, and no assortativity by $M$.\n\nLet the within-host infectiousness kernel for non-carriers be $\\kappa(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$, where $\\kappa(t)$ is proportional to the instantaneous hazard of transmission at infection-age $t$, and let $K \\equiv \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\kappa(t)\\,dt$ denote the baseline infectiousness integral (a time-integrated measure of infectious potential).

They constitute a fraction $1-p$ of the total population.\nType 1: Individuals who carry the biomarker $M$. They constitute a fraction $p$ of the total population, where $p \\in (0,1)$.\n\nThe problem states that the biomarker affects the duration of infectiousness but not susceptibility to infection or instantaneous infectiousness. We are given the integral of the infectiousness kernel for each type. Let $I_0(t)$ be the infectiousness of a type 0 individual at time $t$ since their infection, and $I_1(t)$ be the same for a type 1 individual. The total infectiousness exerted by an individual of type $i$ over their entire infectious period is given by the integral of their infectiousness profile. Let us denote a baseline transmission coefficient by $\\beta$, which encapsulates the contact rate and the per-contact probability of transmission. The problem provides the time-integrated infectiousness kernels, which are proportional to the total number of transmissions an infected individual can cause. For a non-carrier (type 0), the infectiousness integral is $K = \\int_0^\\infty \\kappa(t) dt$. For a carrier (type 1), this integral is given as $fK$, where $f \\in (0,1]$.\n\nThe baseline effective reproduction number, $R_{e,0}$, is defined under the hypothetical condition that all hosts behave as non-carriers (type 0) within the current epidemiological setting (i.e., with the current fraction of susceptible individuals). Let $s$ be the fraction of the population that is susceptible. The problem states \"random mixing\" and \"identical susceptibility,\" which implies that the susceptible fraction $s$ is uniform across both host types. Thus, $R_{e,0}$ is the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infected individual in this hypothetical population and can be written as proportional to the total infectiousness $K$ and the susceptible fraction $s$. Let this proportionality be represented by a constant $\\mathcal{C}$ that incorporates contact rates and transmission probabilities.\n$$\nR_{e,0} = \\mathcal{C} K s\n$$\nThe total number of secondary infections generated by a single infected individual of type 0 (non-carrier) in the actual population is therefore $R_{e,0}$.

This individual generates a total of $R_{e,0}$ secondary infections. Due to random mixing, these new infections are distributed among the population types in proportion to their relative abundance. The fraction of type 0 individuals is $1-p$ and the fraction of type 1 is $p$. Since susceptibility is identical, the new cases will be of type 0 and type 1 in these same proportions.\nTherefore, the number of new infections in type 0 recipients is:\n$$\nG_{00} = R_{e,0} (1-p)\n$$\nAnd the number of new infections in type 1 recipients is:\n$$\nG_{01} = R_{e,0} p\n$$\n\nNext, consider an index case of type $i=1$ (carrier).
