Membrane transporters are uniformly distributed with areal density $\\rho_{t}$, and each transporter has a maximal catalytic turnover $k_{cat}$ (molecules per unit time per transporter).

It is well-posed, with all necessary constants and relationships defined to permit a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and formalizable within the principles of geometry and biophysics. It is not trivial, as it requires correct application of these principles to derive the consequences of a change in scale.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous derivation will now be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a common fold-change factor for two critical biophysical ratios when a spherical cell's diameter doubles. The core of this problem lies in understanding how the surface-area-to-volume ratio scales with size.\n\nFirst, we establish the geometric properties of a sphere of diameter $D$. The surface area, $A$, is given by:\n$$ A = \\pi D^2 $$\nThe volume, $V$, is given by:\n$$ V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{D}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\frac{D^3}{8} = \\frac{1}{6}\\pi D^3 $$\nThe surface-area-to-volume ratio, $\\frac{A}{V}$, is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{A}{V} = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{\\frac{1}{6}\\pi D^3} = \\frac{6}{D} $$\nThis fundamental relationship shows that the surface-area-to-volume ratio is inversely proportional to the diameter.\n\nNow, we evaluate how this ratio changes as the diameter increases from an initial value $d_{initial} = d$ to a final value $d_{final} = 2d$.\nThe initial ratio is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{initial} = \\frac{6}{d_{initial}} = \\frac{6}{d} $$\nThe final ratio is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{final} = \\frac{6}{d_{final}} = \\frac{6}{2d} = \\frac{3}{d} $$\nThe fold-change of the surface-area-to-volume ratio is the final value divided by the initial value:\n$$ \\text{Fold-change}\\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{final}}{\\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{initial}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{d}}{\\frac{6}{d}} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nDoubling the diameter halves the surface-area-to-volume ratio. This is the central scaling law upon which the rest of the analysis depends.\n\nNext, we analyze the two specific ratios given in the problem statement.\n\n1. The ratio of maximal nutrient uptake capacity to metabolic demand.\nThe maximal nutrient uptake capacity is the product of the number of transporters and their maximal turnover rate. The number of transporters is the surface area $A$ multiplied by the areal density $\\rho_{t}$. Thus, uptake capacity is $k_{cat} (\\rho_{t} A)$. The metabolic demand is the volume $V$ multiplied by the volumetric demand rate $q$. Thus, demand is $qV$.\nThe ratio, which we shall call $R_{nutrient}$, is:\n$$ R_{nutrient} = \\frac{k_{cat}\\,\\rho_{t}\\,A}{q\\,V} $$\nThe problem states that $k_{cat}$, $\\rho_{t}$, and $q$ are constants. We can group them into a single constant factor $C_{1} = \\frac{k_{cat}\\,\\rho_{t}}{q}$. The ratio can then be expressed as:\n$$ R_{nutrient} = C_{1} \\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right) $$\nThis shows that the ratio of nutrient supply capacity to demand is directly proportional to the surface-area-to-volume ratio.\n\n2. The ratio of heat dissipation capacity to metabolic heat production.\nThe heat dissipation capacity (per unit temperature difference) is the product of the surface area $A$ and the heat transfer coefficient $h$. Thus, dissipation capacity is $hA$. The metabolic heat production is the product of the volume $V$ and the volumetric power density $p$. Thus, heat production is $pV$.\nThe ratio, which we shall call $R_{heat}$, is:\n$$ R_{heat} = \\frac{h\\,A}{p\\,V} $$\nThe problem states that $h$ and $p$ are constants. We can group them into a single constant factor $C_{2} = \\frac{h}{p}$. The ratio can be expressed as:\n$$ R_{heat} = C_{2} \\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right) $$\nThis shows that the ratio of heat dissipation capacity to production is also directly proportional to the surface-area-to-volume ratio.\n\nSince both $R_{nutrient}$ and $R_{heat}$ are directly proportional to the surface-area-to-volume ratio $\\frac{A}{V}$, their fold-change upon doubling the diameter must be identical to the fold-change of $\\frac{A}{V}$ itself.\nThe fold-change for any quantity $X$ is defined as $\\frac{X_{final}}{X_{initial}}$.\nFor $R_{nutrient}$:\n$$ \\frac{(R_{nutrient})_{final}}{(R_{nutrient})_{initial}} = \\frac{C_{1} \\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{final}}{C_{1} \\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{initial}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{final}}{\\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{initial}} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nFor $R_{heat}$:\n$$ \\frac{(R_{heat})_{final}}{(R_{heat})_{initial}} = \\frac{C_{2} \\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{final}}{C_{2} \\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{initial}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{final}}{\\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{initial}} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThus, the common fold-change factor that applies to both ratios is $\\frac{1}{2}$. This result quantifies the fundamental constraint that as a cell grows, its surface area (which governs transport and exchange with the environment) does not increase as rapidly as its volume (which governs metabolic needs and heat production).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "2938045"}, {"introduction": "A defining feature of a living cell is its ability to maintain an internal environment distinct from its surroundings, a state encoded electrically as the membrane potential.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We will proceed to derive the membrane potential, $V_m$, starting from the Nernst-Planck equation for electrodiffusion.\n\nThe Nernst-Planck equation describes the flux of an ionic species $i$, denoted by $J_i$, under the influence of both a concentration gradient and an electric field.

The potential difference across the membrane is $V_m = V_{\\text{in}} - V_{\\text{out}} = \\phi(L) - \\phi(0)$.

The solution, after applying the boundary conditions $C_i(0) = [i]_{\\text{out}}$ and $C_i(L) = [i]_{\\text{in}}$, and defining the membrane permeability as $P_i = D_i/L$, gives the flux $J_i$. The electric current carried by ion $i$ is $I_i = z_i F J_i$.\nThe resulting Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) current equation for ion $i$ is:\n$$ I_i = P_i \\frac{(z_i F)^2 V_m}{RT} \\frac{[i]_{\\text{in}} - [i]_{\\text{out}}\\exp(z_i F V_m/RT)}{1 - \\exp(z_i F V_m/RT)} $$\nLet us define a dimensionless variable $u = \\frac{F V_m}{RT}$.

This will be true if and only if the given feedback strength $c$ is greater than the minimum value of the function $c(X)$ in the interval $X \\in (0, A)$.\n\nWe find the minimum of $c(X)$ by finding its critical points. We set its derivative, $\\frac{dc}{dX}$, to zero. It is simpler to find the maximum of the denominator, which we define as $h(X) = X^{1/2}(A-X)^{3/2}$. The minimum of $c(X)$ will occur at the same $X$ value that maximizes $h(X)$.\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{dX} = \\frac{1}{2}X^{-1/2}(A-X)^{3/2} + X^{1/2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2}(A-X)^{1/2}(-1) = 0\n$$\nFor $X \\in (0, A)$, we can multiply by $2X^{1/2}$ and divide by $(A-X)^{1/2}$:\n$$\n(A-X) - 3X = 0\n$$\n$$\nA = 4X \\implies X = \\frac{A}{4}\n$$\nThis value of $X$ corresponds to the maximum of $h(X)$ because $h(0) = h(A) = 0$ and $h(X)  0$ for $X \\in (0, A)$. Therefore, it corresponds to the minimum of $c(X)$.\n\nThe minimal feedback strength, $c_{\\min}$, required for bistability is this minimum value of $c(X)$. We substitute $X = A/4$ into our expression for $c(X)$:\n$$\nc_{\\min} = c\\left(\\frac{A}{4}\\right) = \\frac{A}{2 \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{4}} \\left(A-\\frac{A}{4}\\right)^{3/2}}\n$$\n$$\nc_{\\min} = \\frac{A}{2 \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{A}}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3A}{4}\\right)^{3/2}} = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{A} \\frac{(3A)^{3/2}}{4^{3/2}}}\n$$\n$$\nc_{\\min} = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{A} \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}A^{3/2}}{8}} = \\frac{A}{\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}A^2}{8}} = \\frac{8A}{3\\sqrt{3}A^2} = \\frac{8}{3\\sqrt{3}A}\n$$\nFor bistability to exist, we must have $c  c_{\\min}$. The threshold value itself is the minimal strength required. Rationalizing the denominator provides a cleaner representation:\n$$\nc_{\\min} = \\frac{8}{3\\sqrt{3}A} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{8\\sqrt{3}}{9A}\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the minimal feedback strength as a function of $A$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{8\\sqrt{3}}{9A}}$$", "id": "2937999"}]}
