It describes a standard biophysical measurement and requires the application of fundamental principles of electrophysiology. I will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nFirst, the derivation of the relationship between single-channel current, conductance, and driving force is required from first principles.\n\nThe definition of electrical current, $i$, is the rate of flow of electric charge. For a steady current through an ion channel, this current is carried by ions moving down their electrochemical potential gradient. The problem states that the channel acts as a linear, ohmic pore. This is an application of the physical model of Ohm's Law to a microscopic system. In this model, the current is directly proportional to the potential difference that drives the flow of charge carriers.\n\nFor an ion channel embedded in a cell membrane, the flow of ions is governed not solely by the electrical potential difference across the membrane, $V_m$, but by the net electrochemical driving force. This force is the sum of the electrical force and the chemical force (arising from the concentration gradient). The reversal potential, $E_{\\text{rev}}$, is by definition the membrane potential at which the net current through the open channel is zero. At $V_m = E_{\\text{rev}}$, the electrical and chemical forces are precisely balanced. Therefore, the net electrochemical potential difference that drives ionic current at any given membrane potential $V_m$ is the difference $(V_m - E_{\\text{rev}})$.\n\nGiven the assumption of an ohmic pore, the single-channel current, $i$, is linearly proportional to this electrochemical driving force. We can express this proportionality as an equation by introducing a constant of proportionality, which is defined as the single-channel conductance, $\\gamma$. This yields the fundamental relationship:\n$$i = \\gamma (V_m - E_{\\text{rev}})$$\nThis equation is the mathematical formulation that connects the single-channel current ($i$) to the electrochemical driving force ($(V_m - E_{\\text{rev}})$) via the single-channel conductance ($\\gamma$).\n\nNext, we must compute the value of the single-channel conductance, $\\gamma$. To do this, we rearrange the derived equation to solve for $\\gamma$:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{i}{V_m - E_{\\text{rev}}}$$\nThe problem provides the necessary values:\nThe holding membrane potential is $V_m = -80 \\text{ mV}$.\nThe reversal potential is $E_{\\text{rev}} = -20 \\text{ mV}$.\nThe single-channel current is inward with an amplitude of $2 \\text{ pA}$. By electrophysiological convention, inward current is negative, thus $i = -2 \\text{ pA}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the electrochemical driving force:\n$$V_m - E_{\\text{rev}} = (-80 \\text{ mV}) - (-20 \\text{ mV}) = -60 \\text{ mV}$$\nThe negative sign confirms that the driving force is directed inward, which is consistent with the observed inward current.\n\nNow, we substitute the values for current and driving force into the equation for conductance.

The cell's resting membrane potential emerges from the collective activity of these channels.

We shall proceed with its formal derivation and solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the membrane potential in a steady state is the conservation of charge. For a small isopotential cell, the membrane acts as a capacitor. The rate of change of the membrane potential, $V_m$, is related to the total transmembrane current, $I_{\\text{total}}$, and the membrane capacitance, $C_m$, by the equation:\n$$ C_m \\frac{dV_m}{dt} = -I_{\\text{total}} $$\nThe problem defines the resting potential, $V_{\\text{rest}}$, as the steady state where the membrane potential is time-invariant. This condition, $\\frac{dV_m}{dt} = 0$, implies that the total transmembrane current must be zero:\n$$ I_{\\text{total}} = 0 $$\nThe problem states that the only significant currents are the ionic currents through potassium ($K^+$), sodium ($Na^+$), and chloride ($Cl^-$) channels.

The sign of the ionic charge is implicitly accounted for in the value of the Nernst potential, $E_i$.\n\nSubstituting the ohmic relations for $I_{\\text{K}}$, $I_{\\text{Na}}$, and $I_{\\text{Cl}}$ into the zero-current condition, we have:\n$$ g_{\\text{K}}(V_m - E_{\\text{K}}) + g_{\\text{Na}}(V_m - E_{\\text{Na}}) + g_{\\text{Cl}}(V_m - E_{\\text{Cl}}) = 0 $$\nAt steady state, the membrane potential $V_m$ is the resting potential, $V_{\\text{rest}}$.

It describes a fundamental issue in electrophysiology—the voltage error arising from uncompensated series resistance in a voltage-clamp experiment. All provided values and conditions are realistic and physically consistent. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe physical system can be modeled as a simple electrical circuit. The voltage-clamp amplifier acts as a voltage source that applies the command potential, $V_{\\text{cmd}}$, relative to the bath ground. This source is connected in series with the access resistance of the patch pipette, $R_s$, which is in turn connected to the cell membrane. The true transmembrane potential is $V_m$, and the current flowing out of the cell across the membrane and through the series resistance is the measured membrane current, $I_m$.\n\nAccording to Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's voltage law, the command voltage provided by the amplifier must equal the sum of the voltage drop across the cell membrane ($V_m$) and the voltage drop across the series resistance ($V_{Rs}$).\nThe voltage drop across the series resistance is given by Ohm's law:\n$$V_{Rs} = I_m R_s$$\nThe total circuit equation is therefore:\n$$V_{\\text{cmd}} = V_m + I_m R_s$$\nThis equation represents the fundamental relationship between the commanded voltage, the true membrane potential, and the measured current in the presence of a series resistance.\n\nThe problem defines the instantaneous voltage error, which we denote as $V_{\\text{error}}$, as the magnitude of the difference between the command voltage and the true membrane voltage:\n$$V_{\\text{error}} = |V_{\\text{cmd}} - V_m|$$\nBy rearranging the circuit equation, we can express the difference $V_{\\text{cmd}} - V_m$ directly:\n$$V_{\\text{cmd}} - V_m = I_m R_s$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of the voltage error gives the relationship required to estimate it:\n$$V_{\\text{error}} = |I_m R_s|$$\nThis shows that the voltage error is precisely the magnitude of the voltage drop across the uncompensated series resistance.\n\nWe are asked to compute this error at the moment the outward membrane current reaches its peak.

The magnitude of $R_s$ is influenced by the geometry of the pipette tip and the quality of the electrical access to the cell interior. By using pipettes with larger tip openings or by applying brief, strong suction pulses after establishing the whole-cell configuration to further rupture the membrane patch, the experimenter can physically decrease $R_s$. According to the error equation, any reduction in $R_s$ will proportionally reduce $V_{\\text{error}}$ for a given current $I_m$.\n2.  **Use electronic series resistance compensation.** Modern patch-clamp amplifiers contain feedback circuitry designed for this purpose. The circuit measures the membrane current $I_m$ in real-time, multiplies it by a user-set estimate of the series resistance ($R_{s,\\text{est}}$) and a compensation factor ($\\alpha$, typically $0.7$ to $0.8$), and adds this product ($\\alpha I_m R_{s,\\text{est}}$) to the command voltage. The new governing equation becomes $V_{\\text{cmd}} + \\alpha I_m R_{s,\\text{est}} = V_m + I_m R_s$. The resulting voltage error is $V_{\\text{error}} = |V_{\\text{cmd}} - V_m| = |I_m (R_s - \\alpha R_{s,\\text{est}})|$. If the estimate is accurate ($R_{s,\\text{est}} \\approx R_s$), the effective series resistance is reduced to $R_s(1-\\alpha)$, significantly diminishing the voltage error.
