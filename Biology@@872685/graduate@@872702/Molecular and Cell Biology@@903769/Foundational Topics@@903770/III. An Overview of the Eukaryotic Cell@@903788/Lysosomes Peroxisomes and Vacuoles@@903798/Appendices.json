It is a standard, well-posed exercise in biophysical chemistry. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe first task is to derive an expression for the fraction of the total base that is in its protonated form, denoted as $f_{\\mathrm{H}}(\\mathrm{pH})$.\nThe total concentration of the base species, $C_{total}$, is the sum of the concentrations of the unprotonated form, $[\\mathrm{B}]$, and the protonated form, $[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]$.\n$$C_{total} = [\\mathrm{B}] + [\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]$$\nThe fraction that is protonated, $f_{\\mathrm{H}}$, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the protonated form to the total concentration.\n$$f_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}{C_{total}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{B}] + [\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}$$\nTo express this fraction as a function of $\\mathrm{pH}$ and $\\mathrm{p}K_a$, we use the law of mass action for the given equilibrium, $\\mathrm{BH}^{+} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{B} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}$. The acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, is defined as:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}][\\mathrm{H}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}$$\nFrom this expression, we can write the concentration of the unprotonated base, $[\\mathrm{B}]$, in terms of the other species:\n$$[\\mathrm{B}] = \\frac{K_a [\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $f_{\\mathrm{H}}$ gives:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}{\\frac{K_a [\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]} + [\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}$$\nThe term $[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]$ is common to all terms in the fraction and can be cancelled, provided $[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}] \\neq 0$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_a}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]} + 1}$$\nThis expression can be rearranged to a more convenient form:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]}{K_a + [\\mathrm{H}^{+}]}$$\nThe problem requires the final expression to be in terms of $\\mathrm{pH}$ and $\\mathrm{p}K_a$. We use the standard definitions: $\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^{+}])$ and $\\mathrm{p}K_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$. This implies $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}] = 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}$ and $K_a = 10^{-\\mathrm{p}K_a}$. Substituting these into the expression for $f_{\\mathrm{H}}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{H}}(\\mathrm{pH}) = \\frac{10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}}{10^{-\\mathrm{p}K_a} + 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}}$$\nTo simplify, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $10^{\\mathrm{pH}}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{H}}(\\mathrm{pH}) = \\frac{10^{-\\mathrm{pH}} \\cdot 10^{\\mathrm{pH}}}{(10^{-\\mathrm{p}K_a} + 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}) \\cdot 10^{\\mathrm{pH}}} = \\frac{1}{10^{\\mathrm{pH}-\\mathrm{p}K_a} + 1}$$\nThis is the required expression for the protonated fraction as a a function of $\\mathrm{pH}$ and $\\mathrm{p}K_a$.\n\nThe second task is to compute the fold difference, $F$, between the protonated fraction in the lysosomal lumen ($\\mathrm{pH}_{lys} = 4.8$) and the cytosol ($\\mathrm{pH}_{cyt} = 7.2$), given a $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ of $6.8$.\n$$F = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{H}}(\\mathrm{pH}=4.8)}{f_{\\mathrm{H}}(\\mathrm{pH}=7.2)}$$\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, $f_{\\mathrm{H}}(4.8)$. The exponent is $\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_a = 4.8 - 6.8 = -2.0$.\n$$f_{\\mathrm{H}}(4.8) = \\frac{1}{10^{-2.0} + 1} = \\frac{1}{0.01 + 1} = \\frac{1}{1.01}$$\nNext, we calculate the denominator, $f_{\\mathrm{H}}(7.2)$. The exponent is $\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_a = 7.2 - 6.8 = 0.4$.\n$$f_{\\mathrm{H}}(7.2) = \\frac{1}{10^{0.4} + 1}$$\nNow, we compute the ratio $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1.01}}{\\frac{1}{10^{0.4} + 1}} = \\frac{10^{0.4} + 1}{1.01}$$\nWe must now evaluate this expression numerically.\n$$10^{0.4} \\approx 2.511886$$\n$$F \\approx \\frac{2.511886 + 1}{1.01} = \\frac{3.511886}{1.01} \\approx 3.477115$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$F \\approx 3.477$$\nThis result demonstrates that the weak base is significantly more protonated (and thus trapped, as the charged form is typically less membrane-permeant) in the acidic environment of the lysosome compared to the neutral cytosol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.477}$$", "id": "2951684"}, {"introduction": "In experimental cell biology, accurately identifying organelles within a complex micrograph is a fundamental task.

LAMP$1$ is a canonical marker for mammalian lysosomes. PEX$14$ is a marker for peroxisomes in both mammalian and yeast cells. FM$4$-$64$ traces the endocytic pathway to its terminal compartment (lysosome in mammals, vacuole in yeast). LysoTracker accumulates in acidic organelles (lysosomes and vacuoles), and its signal is dissipated by the V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A$1$. The provided quantitative data are physically and biologically plausible.\n-   **Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient data to allow for a logical deduction of organelle identity based on a \"best-fit\" approach, which is standard in the analysis of complex biological data.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using objective, quantitative metrics and asks for a data-driven conclusion.\n\nThe presence of a mixed cell population (mammalian and yeast) is a deliberate complexity, not a flaw. The properties of the markers in these two systems are distinct and are key to solving the problem. The yeast vacuole is the functional equivalent of the mammalian lysosome, and the problem correctly treats them as distinct entities to be identified.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Organelle Identities**\n\nThe fundamental principle is to assign an identity to each puncta class by matching its quantitative profile (marker correlation, dye accumulation, functional response, morphology) to the known properties of candidate organelles: lysosomes, peroxisomes, and vacuoles.\n\n**Analysis of Puncta Class $\\mathcal{P}_1$**\n-   The high Pearson's correlation coefficient with the LAMP$1$ channel ($r_{\\mathrm{LAMP1}} = 0.78 \\pm 0.05$) is very strong evidence. LAMP$1$ is a specific protein marker for the membrane of mammalian lysosomes.\n-   The large fractional decrease in LysoTracker intensity upon treatment with bafilomycin A$1$ ($\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{Lyso}} = -90\\% \\pm 5\\%$) confirms that these organelles are highly acidic and that their acidity is maintained by a V-type H$^+$-ATPase, a hallmark of lysosomes (in mammals) and vacuoles (in yeast).\n-   The low correlation with the PEX$14$ channel ($r_{\\mathrm{PEX14}} = 0.12 \\pm 0.04$) rules out a peroxisomal identity.\n-   The median diameter ($d_{\\mathrm{med}} = 0.35 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$) is within the typical size range for mammalian lysosomes (approximately $0.1-1.2 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$).\n-   The low Manders' overlap coefficient with FM$4$-$64$ ($M_{1,\\mathrm{FM}} = 0.07 \\pm 0.03$) is anomalous, as lysosomes are typically the terminal destination for endocytosed material like FM$4$-$64$. However, considering the overwhelming and highly specific evidence from the LAMP$1$ protein marker and the functional bafilomycin A$1$ assay, this single discrepancy is insufficient to reject the lysosomal identity. Such low overlap might arise from a subpopulation of lysosomes not primarily involved in endocytosis or from kinetic factors not specified.\n-   **Conclusion for $\\mathcal{P}_1$**: The data are most consistent with $\\mathcal{P}_1$ being **lysosomes** (specifically, from the mammalian cells in the sample).\n\n**Analysis of Puncta Class $\\mathcal{P}_2$**\n-   The high Pearson's correlation with the PEX$14$ channel ($r_{\\mathrm{PEX14}} = 0.71 \\pm 0.07$) is definitive evidence for a peroxisomal identity. PEX$14$ is a core component of the peroxisomal protein import machinery.\n-   The low correlation with LAMP$1$ ($r_{\\mathrm{LAMP1}} = 0.10 \\pm 0.06$) and low overlap with FM$4$-$64$ ($M_{1,\\mathrm{FM}} = 0.06 \\pm 0.02$) are consistent with these organelles not being lysosomes or part of the endocytic pathway.\n-   The negligible change in LysoTracker intensity upon bafilomycin A$1$ treatment ($\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{Lyso}} = -8\\% \\pm 6\\%$) confirms that these organelles are not acidic compartments acidified by V-ATPase.\n-   The small diameter ($d_{\\mathrm{med}} = 0.18 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$) is consistent with the typical size of peroxisomes.\n-   **Conclusion for $\\mathcal{P}_2$**: All data points are in strong agreement. $\\mathcal{P}_2$ are **peroxisomes**.\n\n**Analysis of Puncta Class $\\mathcal{P}_3$**\n-   The very high Manders' overlap coefficient with the endocytic tracer FM$4$-$64$ after a $60$-minute chase ($M_{1,\\mathrm{FM}} = 0.82 \\pm 0.06$) indicates these are the terminal compartment of the endocytic pathway.\n-   The large fractional decrease in LysoTracker intensity upon bafilomycin A$1$ treatment ($\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{Lyso}} = -75\\% \\pm 7\\%$) demonstrates that these are acidic compartments, like lysosomes or vacuoles.\n-   The low correlation with the mammalian lysosome marker LAMP$1$ ($r_{\\mathrm{LAMP1}} = 0.18 \\pm 0.08$) argues against them being mammalian lysosomes.\n-   The large median diameter ($d_{\\mathrm{med}} = 1.8 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$) and reported ring-like morphology are highly characteristic of the budding yeast vacuole, which is a large organelle whose membrane would appear as a ring when imaged.\n-   The low correlation with PEX$14$ ($r_{\\mathrm{PEX14}} = 0.11 \\pm 0.05$) rules out a peroxisomal identity.\n-   **Conclusion for $\\mathcal{P}_3$**: The combination of being the terminal endocytic compartment, being acidic, being large with a ring-like morphology, and not being a mammalian lysosome points unequivocally to the identity of **vacuoles** (specifically, from the budding yeast in the sample).\n\n**Summary of Assignments**\n-   $\\mathcal{P}_1$: Lysosomes\n-   $\\mathcal{P}_2$: Peroxisomes\n-   $\\mathcal{P}_3$: Vacuoles\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. $\\mathcal{P}_1$ are lysosomes, $\\mathcal{P}_2$ are peroxisomes, $\\mathcal{P}_3$ are vacuoles.**\n    This assignment perfectly matches the conclusions derived from a systematic analysis of the provided data.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. $\\mathcal{P}_1$ are peroxisomes, $\\mathcal{P}_2$ are lysosomes, $\\mathcal{P}_3$ are vacuoles.**\n    This is incorrect.

The problem is objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. There are no contradictions or invalid premises. Therefore, the problem is **VALID**. I will proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires a three-part analysis: (1) calculating the time-dependent lysosomal pH, (2) determining the resulting change in substrate degradation half-life, and (3) deducing the effect on mTORC1 signaling.\n\n**Part 1: Lysosomal pH Dynamics**\n\nThe relaxation of the lysosomal proton concentration $[\\mathrm{H}^+]_{L}$ towards the constant cytosolic concentration $[\\mathrm{H}^+]_{cyto}$ is described by the first-order differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{d[\\mathrm{H}^+]_{L}}{dt} = -k \\left( [\\mathrm{H}^+]_{L}(t) - [\\mathrm{H}^+]_{cyto} \\right) $$\nThe solution to this equation, given the initial condition $[\\mathrm{H}^+]_{L}(0)$, is:\n$$ [\\mathrm{H}^+]_{L}(t) = [\\mathrm{H}^+]_{cyto} + \\left( [\\mathrm{H}^+]_{L}(0) - [\\mathrm{H}^+]_{cyto} \\right) e^{-kt} $$\nFirst, we convert the given pH values to molar concentrations using the definition $pH = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^+])$.\n- Initial lysosomal proton concentration: $[\\mathrm{H}^+]_{L}(0) = 10^{-pH_L(0)} = 10^{-4.5} \\, \\mathrm{M}$.\n- Constant cytosolic proton concentration: $[\\mathrm{H}^+]_{cyto} = 10^{-pH_{cyto}} = 10^{-7.2} \\, \\mathrm{M}$.\n\nGiven $k = 0.05 \\, \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, we calculate the lysosomal proton concentration and pH at $t=30 \\, \\mathrm{min}$ and $t=60 \\, \\mathrm{min}$.\nAt $t=30 \\, \\mathrm{min}$:\nThe exponential term is $e^{-kt} = e^{-0.05 \\times 30} = e^{-1.5} \\approx 0.2231$.\n$$ [\\mathrm{H}^+]_{L}(30) = 10^{-7.2} + (10^{-4.5} - 10^{-7.2}) \\times 0.2231 $$\n$$ [\\mathrm{H}^+]_{L}(30) \\approx (6.31 \\times 10^{-8}) + (3.16 \\times 10^{-5} - 6.31 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times 0.2231 $$\nSince $[\\mathrm{H}^+]_{L}(0) \\gg [\\mathrm{H}^+]_{cyto}$, we can approximate $([\\mathrm{H}^+]_{L}(0) - [\\mathrm{H}^+]_{cyto}) \\approx [\\mathrm{H}^+]_{L}(0)$.\n$$ [\\mathrm{H}^+]_{L}(30) \\approx 10^{-7.2} + 10^{-4.5} e^{-1.5} \\approx (6.31 \\times 10^{-8}) + (3.16 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 0.2231) \\approx 7.11 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{M} $$\nThe corresponding pH is:\n$$ pH_L(30) = -\\log_{10}(7.11 \\times 10^{-6}) \\approx 5.15 $$\nAt $t=60 \\, \\mathrm{min}$:\nThe exponential term is $e^{-kt} = e^{-0.05 \\times 60} = e^{-3.0} \\approx 0.0498$.\n$$ [\\mathrm{H}^+]_{L}(60) \\approx 10^{-7.2} + 10^{-4.5} e^{-3.0} \\approx (6.31 \\times 10^{-8}) + (3.16 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 0.0498) \\approx 1.63 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{M} $$\nThe corresponding pH is:\n$$ pH_L(60) = -\\log_{10}(1.63 \\times 10^{-6}) \\approx 5.79 $$\nThe pH rises monoexponentially, reaching approximately $pH \\approx 5.1$ at $30 \\, \\mathrm{min}$ and $pH \\approx 5.8$ at $60 \\, \\mathrm{min}$.\n\n**Part 2: Substrate Half-Life Dynamics**\n\nThe activity of the hydrolase is proportional to its protonated fraction, $f_p$. For a single ionizable group with equilibrium $HA \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + A^-$, the protonated fraction is given by:\n$$ f_p(pH) = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_a}} $$\nWith $pK_a = 5.0$. The degradation rate constant, $k_{deg}$, is proportional to $f_p$, and the half-life $\\tau = \\ln(2)/k_{deg}$ is inversely proportional to $f_p$. Therefore, the half-life at time $t$, $\\tau(t)$, can be related to the initial half-life $\\tau_0$ by:\n$$ \\tau(t) = \\tau_0 \\frac{f_p(0)}{f_p(t)} $$\nwhere $\\tau_0 = 30 \\, \\mathrm{min}$ corresponds to $pH(0) = 4.5$.\nFirst, calculate the protonated fractions at the relevant pH values:\n- At $t=0$ ($pH = 4.5$): $f_p(0) = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{4.5 - 5.0}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-0.5}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 0.316} \\approx 0.759$\n- At $t=30 \\, \\mathrm{min}$ ($pH \\approx 5.15$): $f_p(30) = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{5.15 - 5.0}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{0.15}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 1.413} \\approx 0.414$\n- At $t=60 \\, \\mathrm{min}$ ($pH \\approx 5.79$): $f_p(60) = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{5.79 - 5.0}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{0.79}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 6.166} \\approx 0.140$\n\nNow, we calculate the half-lives:\n- At $t=30 \\, \\mathrm{min}$:\n$$ \\tau(30) = 30 \\, \\mathrm{min} \\times \\frac{0.759}{0.414} \\approx 55.0 \\, \\mathrm{min} $$\n- At $t=60 \\, \\mathrm{min}$:\n$$ \\tau(60) = 30 \\, \\mathrm{min} \\times \\frac{0.759}{0.140} \\approx 162.6 \\, \\mathrm{min} $$\nThe substrate half-life increases to approximately $55 \\, \\mathrm{min}$ at $t=30 \\, \\mathrm{min}$ and $160 \\, \\mathrm{min}$ at $t=60 \\, \\mathrm{min}$.\n\n**Part 3: mTORC1 Signaling**\n\nThe problem explicitly states that mTORC1 activation \"requires functional V-ATPase as part of the amino acid sensing machinery\". Treatment with bafilomycin A1, a saturating inhibitor, renders the V-ATPase non-functional. This directly disrupts the amino acid sensing mechanism required for mTORC1 recruitment and activation at the lysosomal surface. Consequently, mTORC1 signaling will be inhibited, irrespective of the ambient amino acid concentrations. This inhibition manifests as decreased phosphorylation of its downstream effectors, such as S6K and 4E-BP1. Cell signaling pathways typically respond on a timescale of minutes, so inhibition within $15$–$30$ minutes is a reasonable expectation.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Upon V-ATPase inhibition, lysosomal pH rises monoexponentially toward the cytosolic value, reaching approximately $\\mathrm{pH}\\approx 5.1$ by $t=30\\,\\mathrm{min}$ and $\\mathrm{pH}\\approx 5.8$ by $t=60\\,\\mathrm{min}$. The protonated active fraction of the hydrolase decreases accordingly, increasing the substrate half-life to roughly $\\sim 55\\,\\mathrm{min}$ at $t=30\\,\\mathrm{min}$ and $\\sim 160\\,\\mathrm{min}$ at $t=60\\,\\mathrm{min}$. mTORC1 is rapidly inhibited (within $\\sim 15$–$30\\,\\mathrm{min}$) due to loss of V-ATPase–dependent amino acid sensing and reduced lysosomal efflux of amino acids, leading to decreased phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor $4$E-binding protein $1$ (4E-BP1).**\n- The calculated pH values ($5.15$ and $5.79$) and half-lives ($55.0 \\, \\mathrm{min}$ and $162.6 \\, \\mathrm{min}$) are in excellent agreement with the values stated. The description of pH change as \"monoexponential\" is correct. The conclusion about mTORC1 inhibition and its downstream consequences is also correct based on the provided premises.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Bafilomycin A1 enhances V-ATPase function, hyperacidifying lysosomes to $\\mathrm{pH}4.0$ within $30\\,\\mathrm{min}$, thereby accelerating degradation and reducing substrate half-life to $\\sim 10\\,\\mathrm{min}$ while activating mTORC1 due to increased amino acid liberation.**\n- This statement is fundamentally flawed. Bafilomycin A1 is a V-ATPase inhibitor, not an enhancer. It causes lysosomal pH to rise (alkalinize), not fall (hyperacidify). All subsequent conclusions are based on this false premise.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Cytosolic buffering prevents any change in lysosomal pH for several hours after bafilomycin A1, so degradative capacity remains near baseline over the first hour; mTORC1 remains active initially and then becomes hyperactivated due to accumulation of amino acids within lysosomes.**\n- This incorrectly conflates the stability of cytosolic pH with that of lysosomal pH. The problem model explicitly describes a change in lysosomal pH due to proton leak. The premise that pH is unchanged is false. The conclusion about mTORC1 hyperactivation is also incorrect, as V-ATPase inhibition inactivates mTORC1.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Lysosomal pH increases linearly with time to reach $\\mathrm{pH}=7.2$ at $t=60\\,\\mathrm{min}$, but hydrolase activity is independent of protonation state so the substrate half-life is unchanged; mTORC1 becomes activated by the accumulation of autophagosomes when degradation stalls.**\n- This statement contains multiple errors. The pH does not increase linearly; it follows a monoexponential decay of the proton concentration difference. Hydrolase activity is explicitly defined as being pH-dependent. mTORC1 is inhibited, not activated, by V-ATPase loss.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Lysosomal pH increases monoexponentially, but mTORC1 activity transiently increases over the first $30\\,\\mathrm{min}$ because blocked lysosomal degradation causes cytosolic amino acids to accumulate; the substrate half-life initially decreases and only later increases as pH continues to rise.**\n- The claim of a transient increase in mTORC1 activity is contrary to its dependence on functional V-ATPase. The claim that substrate half-life initially decreases is also false; as pH rises from $4.5$ away from the pH optimum for this enzyme (which is below the pKa of 5.0), activity continuously decreases, and thus the half-life continuously increases.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2951526"}]}
