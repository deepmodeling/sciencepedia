The values for nuclear radius, NPC density, and stoichiometry of a nucleoporin component are within biologically plausible ranges for a eukaryotic cell. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution through a standard calculation. The terminology is objective and precise. The problem is a straightforward application of geometry and stoichiometry to a biological context, and it does not violate any fundamental principles.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe task is to compute the total number of a specific nucleoporin molecule within a single cell. The problem provides direct measurements that allow for a systematic calculation. We must proceed with logical rigor.\n\nFirst, we must determine the total surface area of the nuclear envelope. The nucleus is modeled as a sphere of radius $r$.

This is found by multiplying the surface area $A$ by the given surface density of pores, $\\sigma = 5\\ \\text{pores}\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$.\n$$N_{\\text{NPC}} = A \\times \\sigma$$\n$$N_{\\text{NPC}} = (144\\pi\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^2) \\times (5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-2}) = 720\\pi$$\nThis result is a dimensionless quantity representing the total count of pores.\n\nThird, we compute the total number of molecules of the nucleoporin of interest, $N_{\\text{total}}$. The problem states there are $N_{\\text{NUP/NPC}} = 32$ copies of this protein per NPC. It is also assumed that all copies are assembled into NPCs. Therefore, we multiply the total number of NPCs by the number of molecules per NPC:\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = N_{\\text{NPC}} \\times N_{\\text{NUP/NPC}}$$\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = (720\\pi) \\times 32 = 23040\\pi$$\n\nFinally, we must provide a numerical answer rounded to three significant figures. We use the value of $\\pi$ to compute the numerical result.\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = 23040 \\times \\pi \\approx 23040 \\times 3.14159265...$$\n$$N_{\\text{total}} \\approx 72382.29...$$\nRounding this value to three significant figures gives $72400$.
