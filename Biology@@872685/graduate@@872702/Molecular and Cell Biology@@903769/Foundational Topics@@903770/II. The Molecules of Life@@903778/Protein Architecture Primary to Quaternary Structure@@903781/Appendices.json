This process forms $5 - 1 = 4$ peptide bonds. Based on the provided principle (i), the formation of each peptide bond results in the elimination of one molecule of water.\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the masses of the individual free amino acids, which we shall denote $M_{sum}$.\n$$M_{sum} = M_{Ala} + M_{Gly} + M_{Ser} + M_{Val} + M_{Thr}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$M_{sum} = 89.094 + 75.067 + 105.093 + 117.148 + 119.119 = 505.521 \\text{ Da}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total mass lost due to the elimination of $4$ water molecules.

The problem states that the side chains are not titratable near $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.00$, so we need only consider the N-terminal amino group and the C-terminal carboxyl group.

The two-state model is a common and valid approximation for many small, single-domain proteins. The provided data are realistic for such an experiment. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution via linear regression. The definition of the parameter $m$ through the specified equation, while potentially divergent from some conventions, is explicitly stated and thus a part of the problem's formal structure, not a flaw. The problem is therefore deemed self-contained, consistent, and solvable under the principles of chemical thermodynamics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be furnished.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Linear Free Energy Relationship**\n\nThe folding of a protein from the unfolded state ($U$) to the native state ($N$) is described by the equilibrium:\n$$U \\rightleftharpoons N$$\nThe equilibrium constant for folding is given by the ratio of the concentrations of the native and unfolded states:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{fold}} = \\frac{[N]}{[U]}$$\nThe standard Gibbs free energy of folding, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$, is related to this equilibrium constant by the fundamental thermodynamic equation:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} = -RT \\ln K_{\\mathrm{fold}}$$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal-gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe central assumption of the linear free energy model is that the chemical potentials, $\\mu$, of both the native and unfolded states vary linearly with the concentration of the denaturant, $[D]$, at least over the concentration range of interest. We can express this dependence as:\n$$\\mu_N([D]) = \\mu_N^{\\circ} + s_N [D]$$\n$$\\mu_U([D]) = \\mu_U^{\\circ} + s_U [D]$$\nHere, $\\mu_N^{\\circ}$ and $\\mu_U^{\\circ}$ are the standard chemical potentials of the native and unfolded states, respectively, in pure water ($[D]=0$). The parameters $s_N$ and $s_U$ are the slopes $\\frac{d\\mu_N}{d[D]}$ and $\\frac{d\\mu_U}{d[D]}$, representing the sensitivity of each state's stability to the denaturant concentration.\n\nThe Gibbs free energy of folding at a given denaturant concentration, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}([D])$, is the difference between the chemical potentials of the final (native) and initial (unfolded) states:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}([D]) = \\mu_N([D]) - \\mu_U([D])$$\nSubstituting the linear relationships gives:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}([D]) = (\\mu_N^{\\circ} + s_N [D]) - (\\mu_U^{\\circ} + s_U [D])$$\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}([D]) = (\\mu_N^{\\circ} - \\mu_U^{\\circ}) + (s_N - s_U)[D]$$\nThe term $(\\mu_N^{\\circ} - \\mu_U^{\\circ})$ is the Gibbs free energy of folding in pure water, which we denote as $\\Delta G_{H_{2}O}$. Thus, we arrive at the derived relationship:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}([D]) = \\Delta G_{H_{2}O} + (s_N - s_U)[D]$$\nThe problem specifies the relationship as $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}([D]) = \\Delta G_{H_{2}O} - m\\,[D]$. By comparing our derived form with the one given in the problem, we identify the parameter $m$ as:\n$$m = -(s_N - s_U) = s_U - s_N$$\nPhysically, denaturants such as urea function by making the solvent a better solvent for the polypeptide chain, thus stabilizing the unfolded state, which has a much larger solvent-accessible surface area than the compact native state. This implies that the chemical potential of the unfolded state is lowered more significantly by the denaturant than that of the native state. Assuming stabilization corresponds to a decrease in chemical potential, both $s_N$ and $s_U$ are negative, with $|s_U|  |s_N|$, which means $s_U  s_N$. Consequently, the slope term $(s_N - s_U)$ is positive, and $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ increases with $[D]$. The parameter $m = s_U - s_N$ must therefore be negative. This completes the required derivation and clarifies the definition of $m$ for this problem.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation and Linear Regression**\n\nFirst, we must calculate the Gibbs free energy of folding, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$, for each data point. For a two-state transition, the equilibrium constant can be expressed in terms of the fraction unfolded, $f_U$:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{fold}} = \\frac{[N]}{[U]} = \\frac{f_N}{f_U} = \\frac{1 - f_U}{f_U}$$\nThen, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ is calculated using:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} = -RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - f_U}{f_U}\\right)$$\nGiven $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, the product $RT = (8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})(298\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 2477.57\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$.

The equation is typically written in terms of the Hill coefficient $n_H$ and the partial pressure at half-saturation, $p_{50}$:\n$$ Y = \\frac{(p_{\\mathrm{O_2}})^{n_H}}{(p_{50})^{n_H} + (p_{\\mathrm{O_2}})^{n_H}} $$\nTo facilitate linear regression, this equation is rearranged and linearized by taking the natural logarithm:\n$$ \\frac{Y}{1 - Y} = \\left(\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}}{p_{50}}\\right)^{n_H} $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{Y}{1 - Y}\\right) = n_H \\ln(p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}) - n_H \\ln(p_{50}) $$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $y = mx + c$, where:\n- The dependent variable is $y = \\ln\\left(\\frac{Y}{1 - Y}\\right)$.\n- The independent variable is $x = \\ln(p_{\\mathrm{O_2}})$.\n- The slope is the Hill coefficient, $m = n_H$.\n- The y-intercept is $c = -n_H \\ln(p_{50})$.\n\nFirst, we must transform the given data points $(p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}, Y)$ into $(x, y)$ coordinates for the Hill plot. The number of data points is $N=5$.\n\nThe given data are:\n1. $(p_{\\mathrm{O_2},1}, Y_1) = (14, 0.2691)$\n2. $(p_{\\mathrm{O_2},2}, Y_2) = (16, 0.3487)$\n3. $(p_{\\mathrm{O_2},3}, Y_3) = (20, 0.5000)$\n4. $(p_{\\mathrm{O_2},4}, Y_4) = (24, 0.6250)$\n5. $(p_{\\mathrm{O_2},5}, Y_5) = (28, 0.7195)$\n\nThe transformed coordinates $(x_i, y_i) = (\\ln(p_{\\mathrm{O_2},i}), \\ln(\\frac{Y_i}{1-Y_i}))$ are calculated as follows:\n1. $x_1 = \\ln(14) \\approx 2.639057$, $y_1 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.2691}{1 - 0.2691}\\right) \\approx \\ln(0.368176) \\approx -1.000010$\n2. $x_2 = \\ln(16) \\approx 2.772589$, $y_2 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.3487}{1 - 0.3487}\\right) \\approx \\ln(0.535391) \\approx -0.624729$\n3. $x_3 = \\ln(20) \\approx 2.995732$, $y_3 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.5000}{1 - 0.5000}\\right) = \\ln(1) = 0$\n4. $x_4 = \\ln(24) \\approx 3.178054$, $y_4 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.6250}{1 - 0.6250}\\right) \\approx \\ln(1.666...) \\approx 0.510826$\n5. $x_5 = \\ln(28) \\approx 3.332205$, $y_5 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.7195}{1 - 0.7195}\\right) \\approx \\ln(2.565062) \\approx 0.941950$\n\nFor an unweighted OLS linear regression, the slope $n_H$ is given by the formula:\n$$ n_H = \\frac{N \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i y_i) - (\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i)(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i)}{N \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i^2) - (\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i)^2} $$\nWe compute the necessary sums from the transformed data:\n- $N = 5$\n- $\\sum x_i = 2.639057 + 2.772589 + 2.995732 + 3.178054 + 3.332205 = 14.917637$\n- $\\sum y_i = -1.000010 - 0.624729 + 0 + 0.510826 + 0.941950 = -0.171963$\n- $\\sum x_i^2 = (2.639057)^2 + (2.772589)^2 + (2.995732)^2 + (3.178054)^2 + (3.332205)^2 \\approx 44.829900$\n- $\\sum x_i y_i = (2.639057)(-1.000010) + (2.772589)(-0.624729) + (2.995732)(0) + (3.178054)(0.510826) + (3.332205)(0.941950) \\approx 0.390810$\n\nNow, we substitute these sums into the slope formula.\nNumerator:\n$ N \\sum(x_i y_i) - (\\sum x_i)(\\sum y_i) = 5 \\times (0.390810) - (14.917637)(-0.171963) $\n$ = 1.954050 - (-2.565264) = 4.519314 $\n\nDenominator:\n$ N \\sum(x_i^2) - (\\sum x_i)^2 = 5 \\times (44.829900) - (14.917637)^2 $\n$ = 224.149500 - 222.535004 = 1.614496 $\n\nThe Hill coefficient is the ratio:\n$$ n_H = \\frac{4.519314}{1.614496} \\approx 2.80008 $$\nRounding this result to three significant figures, we get $n_H = 2.80$.\n\nThe magnitude of the Hill coefficient, $n_H = 2.80$, has a profound biophysical meaning.\n1.  **Positive Cooperativity**: Since $n_H  1$, the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin is positively cooperative. This means that the binding of an oxygen molecule to one subunit of the hemoglobin tetramer increases the affinity of the remaining subunits for oxygen. A value of $n_H = 1$ would imply independent binding sites with no cooperativity (as seen in myoglobin), while $n_H  1$ would indicate negative cooperativity.\n2.  **Subunit Interaction and Allostery**: Hemoglobin is a tetramer, consisting of four subunits ($n=4$). The measured Hill coefficient $n_H$ is an empirical index of cooperativity and is always less than the total number of subunits ($n_H  n$). The value of $2.80$ is significantly greater than $1$ and approaches the theoretical maximum of $4$, indicating a very strong cooperative interaction among the subunits. This high degree of cooperativity is a direct consequence of allostery, specifically the ligand-induced transition between two distinct quaternary structures: the low-affinity Tense (T) state and the high-affinity Relaxed (R) state.\n3.  **Quaternary Structural Transition**: Oxygen binding destabilizes the T-state and favors the conformational shift to the R-state. The T-state is constrained by a network of salt bridges which are broken upon oxygenation. The transition of one subunit to the R-state upon binding oxygen lowers the energetic barrier for the other subunits to also transition to the R-state, thereby increasing their binding affinity. The value $n_H = 2.80$ quantifies the strength of this coupling between oxygen binding and the T-to-R quaternary transition.\n4.  **Physiological Significance**: This strong cooperativity results in a steep, sigmoidal binding curve, which is crucial for efficient oxygen transport. It allows hemoglobin to become nearly fully saturated with oxygen in the lungs, where $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ is high (around $13 \\ \\mathrm{kPa}$), and to release a large fraction of its bound oxygen in the peripheral tissues, where $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ is low (around $2-5 \\ \\mathrm{kPa}$). A non-cooperative protein ($n_H=1$) with the same $p_{50}$ would be far less efficient at delivering oxygen over this physiological pressure range.\n\nIn summary, the calculated Hill coefficient of $2.80$ reflects strong positive cooperativity in hemoglobin, arising from tightly coupled allosteric transitions in its quaternary structure, which is fundamental to its biological role as an oxygen transporter.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.80}$$", "id": "2960144"}]}
