Let the acid dissociation constant of the imidazolium be characterized by $pK_a^{\\mathrm{His}}=6.0$.

Express your answer as a decimal fraction and round your result to four significant figures.\n\nThen, based on your computed fraction and the general dependence of buffer capacity on the proximity of $\\mathrm{pH}$ to $pK_a$ for a monoprotic conjugate acid-base pair, briefly discuss the consequence for the buffer capacity of histidine at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.4$ relative to its maximum.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the fraction of protonated histidine side chains and its evaluation under specified conditions, followed by a discussion of buffer capacity. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We shall proceed.\n\nLet the protonated form of the histidine side chain (imidazolium) be denoted by $HA^+$ and the deprotonated form (imidazole) be denoted by $A$. The acid dissociation equilibrium is described by the reaction:\n$$HA^+ \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + A$$\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, is defined as the ratio of the product of the concentrations of the products to the concentration of the reactant at equilibrium. Given that the activity coefficients are unity, we may use molar concentrations:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[\\text{H}^+][A]}{[HA^+]}$$\nHere, $[\\text{H}^+]$, $[A]$, and $[HA^+]$ represent the molar concentrations of the hydronium ion, the deprotonated side chain, and the protonated side chain, respectively.\n\nThe quantity to be derived is the fraction of histidine molecules whose side chain is protonated, which we denote as $f_{\\mathrm{H^+}}$. This fraction is defined as the concentration of the protonated form divided by the total concentration of all forms of the side chain:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{H^+}} = \\frac{[HA^+]}{[HA^+] + [A]}$$\nTo express $f_{\\mathrm{H^+}}$ in terms of measurable quantities like $[\\text{H}^+]$ and $K_a$, we first rearrange the expression for $K_a$ to solve for $[A]$:\n$$[A] = \\frac{K_a [HA^+]}{[\\text{H}^+]}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[A]$ into the denominator of the equation for $f_{\\mathrm{H^+}}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{H^+}} = \\frac{[HA^+]}{[HA^+] + \\frac{K_a [HA^+]}{[\\text{H}^+]}}$$\nThe term $[HA^+]$ is common to all terms in the fraction and can be cancelled by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by $[HA^+]$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{H^+}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{K_a}{[\\text{H}^+]}}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[\\text{H}^+]$ yields an equivalent and often more convenient form of the expression:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{H^+}} = \\frac{[\\text{H}^+]}{[\\text{H}^+] + K_a}$$\nThis is the required expression derived from first principles.\n\nThis expression can also be cast in terms of $\\mathrm{pH}$ and $pK_a$. We recall the definitions $\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}([\\text{H}^+])$ and $pK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$. From these, we have $[\\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}$ and $K_a = 10^{-pK_a}$. Substituting these into the first derived form for $f_{\\mathrm{H^+}}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{H^+}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{10^{-pK_a}}{10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - pK_a}}$$\nThis latter form is computationally convenient.\n\nWe are given the values $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.4$ and $pK_a^{\\mathrm{His}} = 6.0$. Substituting these into the derived expression:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{H^+}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{7.4 - 6.0}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{1.4}}$$\nWe evaluate the term $10^{1.4}$:\n$$10^{1.4} \\approx 25.118864$$\nNow we can compute the fraction:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{H^+}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 25.118864} = \\frac{1}{26.118864} \\approx 0.0382864$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as required, gives:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{H^+}} \\approx 0.03829$$\n\nThe second part of the problem concerns buffer capacity. The buffer capacity, $\\beta$, of a monoprotic acid-base system is maximized when the concentrations of the conjugate acid and conjugate base are equal, i.e., $[HA^+] = [A]$. This condition occurs when $\\mathrm{pH} = pK_a$. At this point, the buffer is most effective at resisting changes in $\\mathrm{pH}$ upon addition of either acid or base.\n\nIn the given scenario, the $\\mathrm{pH}$ of the solution is $7.4$, while the $pK_a$ of the histidine side chain is $6.0$. The difference is $\\Delta = |\\mathrm{pH} - pK_a| = |7.4 - 6.0| = 1.4$. This is a significant deviation from the condition of maximum buffer capacity. The ratio of the deprotonated form to the protonated form is $\\frac{[A]}{[HA^+]} = 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - pK_a} = 10^{1.4} \\approx 25.1$. This shows that the equilibrium is heavily shifted towards the deprotonated base form ($A$), with only about $3.8\\%$ of the side chains being in the protonated acid form ($HA^+$).\n\nConsequently, the buffering capacity of the histidine side chain at $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.4$ is substantially diminished relative to its maximum capacity at $\\mathrm{pH} = 6.0$. The system has a large reserve of the base form to neutralize added acid, but has very little of the acid form to neutralize added base. Therefore, the solution is poorly buffered against an increase in $\\mathrm{pH}$ (addition of base). Generally, a buffer is considered effective in the range $\\mathrm{pH} = pK_a \\pm 1$. Since $7.4$ is outside the range $6.0 \\pm 1.0$ (i.e., $[5.0, 7.0]$), the histidine side chain alone is a relatively poor buffer at physiological $\\mathrm{pH}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.03829}$$", "id": "2932417"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the principles for a single amino acid, we can predict the overall electrostatic character of an entire peptide by considering all of its ionizable groups.
