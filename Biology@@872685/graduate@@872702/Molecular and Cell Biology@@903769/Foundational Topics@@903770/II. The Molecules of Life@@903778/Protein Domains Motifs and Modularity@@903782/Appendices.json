The binding equilibrium is given as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{P} + \\mathrm{R} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{PR}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{P}$ is the protein (KH domain), $\\mathrm{R}$ is the RNA, and $\\mathrm{PR}$ is the complex.

It is based on standard principles of protein biophysical chemistry, specifically the thermodynamic analysis of protein stability. The provided values are physically realistic for macromolecular unfolding transitions. The problem is self-contained and provides a clear, unambiguous path to a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be presented.\n\nThe analysis of protein unfolding cooperativity relies on comparing the calorimetric enthalpy, $\\Delta H_{\\text{cal}}$, and the van't Hoff enthalpy, $\\Delta H_{\\text{vH}}$. The calorimetric enthalpy is the true, model-independent change in enthalpy for the unfolding process, obtained by integrating the excess heat capacity peak from a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiment. The van't Hoff enthalpy is derived from the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant for unfolding, under the central assumption that the process can be described as a simple two-state equilibrium between the native ($N$) and unfolded ($U$) states: $N \\rightleftharpoons U$.\n\nThe problem states that the measured calorimetric enthalpy, $\\Delta H_{\\text{cal, meas}}$, is given per mole of *total* protein loaded into the calorimeter. However, only a fraction of this protein, $f_{\\text{act}}$, is competent to undergo the cooperative unfolding transition. The remaining fraction, $1 - f_{\\text{act}}$, is presumed to be misfolded or aggregated and does not contribute to the measured heat effect. Therefore, the measured enthalpy must be corrected to reflect the true enthalpy change per mole of *active* protein. The total heat absorbed, $Q$, is the product of the true molar enthalpy, $\\Delta H_{\\text{cal}}$, and the number of active moles, $n_{\\text{act}}$. The measured enthalpy is this total heat divided by the total moles loaded, $n_{\\text{total}}$.\n\nThe relationship is as follows:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{cal, meas}} = \\frac{Q}{n_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{cal}} \\cdot n_{\\text{act}}}{n_{\\text{total}}} $$\nSince $n_{\\text{act}} = f_{\\text{act}} \\cdot n_{\\text{total}}$, we can substitute this into the equation:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{cal, meas}} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{cal}} \\cdot (f_{\\text{act}} \\cdot n_{\\text{total}})}{n_{\\text{total}}} = \\Delta H_{\\text{cal}} \\cdot f_{\\text{act}} $$\nFrom this, we derive the expression for the true calorimetric enthalpy per mole of unfolding protein:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{cal}} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{cal, meas}}}{f_{\\text{act}}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{cal}} = \\frac{3.40 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}}{0.80} = 4.25 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1} $$\nThis value, $\\Delta H_{\\text{cal}}$, represents the actual enthalpy change for the full unfolding of one mole of the protein domain.\n\nThe cooperativity parameter, which we denote as $\\kappa$, is defined as the ratio of the van't Hoff enthalpy to the corrected calorimetric enthalpy:\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vH}}}{\\Delta H_{\\text{cal}}} $$\nFor a true two-state transition, the assumptions underlying both measurements are met, and $\\Delta H_{\\text{vH}} = \\Delta H_{\\text{cal}}$, which means $\\kappa = 1$. Deviations from $\\kappa = 1$ indicate that the two-state model is inadequate.\n\nWe now compute $\\kappa$ using the given $\\Delta H_{\\text{vH}}$ and the calculated $\\Delta H_{\\text{cal}}$:\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{2.40 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}}{4.25 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}} = \\frac{2.40}{4.25} \\approx 0.564705... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\kappa \\approx 0.565 $$\n\nThe brief interpretation of the result $\\kappa  1$ is as follows. The inequality $\\Delta H_{\\text{vH}}  \\Delta H_{\\text{cal}}$ signifies that the unfolding process is not a simple, two-state transition. Instead, the process must involve at least one thermodynamically stable intermediate state. The calorimetric enthalpy measures the total heat absorbed from the beginning (fully native state) to the end (fully unfolded state) of the process. The van't Hoff enthalpy, derived from the sharpness of the transition, reflects the enthalpy of the cooperative unit that \"melts\" in a single step. When $\\kappa  1$, it implies that the cooperative unit of unfolding is smaller than the entire structural domain giving rise to the total calorimetric enthalpy. In the context of modular proteins, this result suggests that the suspected \"single folding domain\" does not unfold as one monolithic unit. Instead, it may undergo fragmentation into smaller cooperative units (subdomains or stable motifs) that unfold in sequential steps, populating one or more intermediate states ($N \\rightleftharpoons I \\rightleftharpoons U$).
