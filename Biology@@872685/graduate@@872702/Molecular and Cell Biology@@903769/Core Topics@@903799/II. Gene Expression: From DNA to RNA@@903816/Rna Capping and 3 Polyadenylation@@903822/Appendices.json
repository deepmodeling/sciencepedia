In $5'$ capping, one guanosine triphosphate (GTP) is used to form a $5'-5'$ triphosphate linkage to the nascent RNA, followed by methyl transfer that uses one molecule of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). In $3'$ polyadenylation, a polyadenosine tail of length $L$ is added by poly(A) polymerase, consuming one adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per adenosine incorporated. Assume the following widely accepted biochemical facts for energetic accounting:\n\n- Each nucleotidyl transfer that incorporates one nucleotide from a nucleoside triphosphate into RNA proceeds by cleavage of the $\\alpha$–$\\beta$ phosphoanhydride bond of the triphosphate, releasing inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), and is thermodynamically driven forward in vivo by hydrolysis of PPi to two orthophosphates. Count both bond cleavages.\n- The $5'$ capping guanylyltransfer reaction likewise proceeds via cleavage of one GTP to guanosine monophosphate (GMP) plus PPi, and the subsequent hydrolysis of PPi to orthophosphate. Count both bond cleavages.\n- Regeneration of one molecule of SAM for methyl transfer during capping consumes one ATP in a manner that, when coupled to PPi hydrolysis, results in the cleavage of two phosphoanhydride bonds in total.

Subsequent hydrolysis of $PP_i$ to two orthophosphates occurs. This constitutes two phosphoanhydride bond cleavages per incorporated nucleotide.\n  - **Capping (Guanylylation):** $GTP$ is cleaved to guanosine monophosphate ($GMP$) plus $PP_i$, followed by $PP_i$ hydrolysis. This constitutes two phosphoanhydride bond cleavages.\n  - **SAM Regeneration:** Regeneration of one $SAM$ molecule consumes one $ATP$ and results in the cleavage of two phosphoanhydride bonds in total.\n  - **Energy Unit:** The standard free energy released per phosphoanhydride bond cleavage is $\\Delta g$, which is identical for $ATP$ and $GTP$.\n- **Assumptions for Calculation:**\n  - One $GTP$ and one $SAM$ regeneration are required per cap.\n  - Exactly $L$ adenosines are added during polyadenylation.\n- **Required Output:** A closed-form expression $E(L)$ for the total standard free energy cost.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem describes a simplified but correct model of eukaryotic mRNA processing based on fundamental principles of molecular biology and bioenergetics. The mechanisms of nucleotide addition, pyrophosphate hydrolysis, and the role of $ATP$ in SAM regeneration are standard biochemical knowledge. The problem is scientifically grounded.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a complete set of rules and defined parameters ($L$, $\\Delta g$) to uniquely determine the total energy cost $E(L)$.

It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed.\n- **Action:** Proceed with the solution.\n\nThe total standard free energy cost, $E(L)$, is the sum of the energy cost for $5'$ capping, $E_{cap}$, and the energy cost for $3'$ polyadenylation, $E_{poly(A)}$.\n$$\nE(L) = E_{cap} + E_{poly(A)}\n$$\nWe will now derive expressions for each component based on the number of high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds cleaved.\n\nFirst, consider the $5'$ capping process. This process has two energetic costs: the guanylylation reaction and the regeneration of $SAM$ for methylation.\n\n1.  **Guanylylation:** The problem states that one molecule of $GTP$ is used, which is cleaved to $GMP$ and $PP_i$. This is the cleavage of the $\\alpha$–$\\beta$ phosphoanhydride bond of $GTP$, which accounts for one high-energy bond. The released pyrophosphate, $PP_i$, is then hydrolyzed to two inorganic phosphates, which involves the cleavage of a second high-energy bond.\n    $$\n    GTP \\rightarrow GMP + PP_i \\quad (\\text{1 bond cleavage})\n    $$\n    $$\n    PP_i + H_2O \\rightarrow 2 P_i \\quad (\\text{1 bond cleavage})\n    $$\n    Thus, the guanylylation step results in the cleavage of $2$ phosphoanhydride bonds, sourced from one $GTP$ molecule.\n\n2.  **Methylation via SAM Regeneration:** The problem states that the regeneration of one molecule of $SAM$ consumes one molecule of $ATP$ and results in the cleavage of two phosphoanhydride bonds. This corresponds to the biological pathway where $ATP$ is hydrolyzed to $AMP$ and $PP_i$, followed by the hydrolysis of the released $PP_i$.\n    $$\n    ATP \\rightarrow AMP + PP_i \\quad (\\text{1 bond cleavage})\n    $$\n    $$\n    PP_i + H_2O \\rightarrow 2 P_i \\quad (\\text{1 bond cleavage})\n    $$\n    This step results in the cleavage of $2$ phosphoanhydride bonds, sourced from one $ATP$ molecule.\n\nThe total number of bonds cleaved during $5'$ capping is the sum from these two steps:\n$$\nN_{cap} = 2 (\\text{from GTP}) + 2 (\\text{from ATP}) = 4 \\text{ bonds}\n$$\nThe energy cost for capping is therefore:\n$$\nE_{cap} = 4 \\Delta g\n$$\n\nNext, we consider the $3'$ polyadenylation process. This involves the addition of a poly(A) tail of length $L$.\n\n1.  **Adenosine Incorporation:** For each of the $L$ adenosine residues added to the tail, one molecule of $ATP$ is consumed. The rule for nucleotidyl transfer applies: the $ATP$ is cleaved to $AMP$ and $PP_i$, and the resulting $PP_i$ is hydrolyzed.\n    For each adenosine added, the reactions are:\n    $$\n    ATP \\rightarrow AMP + PP_i \\quad (\\text{1 bond cleavage})\n    $$\n    $$\n    PP_i + H_2O \\rightarrow 2 P_i \\quad (\\text{1 bond cleavage})\n    $$\n    This means that the incorporation of a single adenosine residue costs $2$ phosphoanhydride bond cleavages.\n\n2.  **Total for Polyadenylation:** Since $L$ adenosine residues are added, the total number of bonds cleaved during polyadenylation is:\n    $$\n    N_{poly(A)} = L \\times 2 = 2L \\text{ bonds}\n    $$\nThe energy cost for polyadenylation is therefore:\n$$\nE_{poly(A)} = (2L) \\Delta g\n$$\n\nFinally, the total standard free energy cost $E(L)$ is the sum of the costs for capping and polyadenylation.\n$$\nE(L) = E_{cap} + E_{poly(A)} = 4 \\Delta g + 2L \\Delta g\n$$\nFactoring out the common term $\\Delta g$ gives the final expression for the total energy cost as a function of $L$.\n$$\nE(L) = (2L + 4) \\Delta g\n$$\n\nFor completeness, we also address the first sub-task. The number of $ATP$ molecules consumed is $1$ (for SAM regeneration) plus $L$ (for polyadenylation), totaling $L+1$. The number of $GTP$ molecules consumed is $1$ (for guanylylation). However, the final answer required is the expression for $E(L)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{(2L + 4)\\Delta g}\n$$", "id": "2835502"}, {"introduction": "The specificity of RNA processing is paramount, and it is largely encoded in the sequence of the transcript itself, particularly within motifs like the polyadenylation signal (PAS).
