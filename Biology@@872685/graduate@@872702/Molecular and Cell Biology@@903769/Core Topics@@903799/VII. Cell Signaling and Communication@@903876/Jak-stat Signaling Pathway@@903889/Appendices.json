{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding a signaling pathway requires a deep appreciation for the function of its constituent proteins. Dominant-negative mutations are invaluable experimental tools that allow researchers to probe protein function within a living cell. This exercise challenges you to think critically about the modular nature of STAT proteins—specifically their SH2 and DNA-binding domains—to explain how a cleverly designed mutant can disrupt signaling even in the presence of the normal protein [@problem_id:2277393].", "problem": "In a laboratory study of erythropoiesis (the production of red blood cells), researchers are using an erythroid progenitor cell line that relies on the hormone erythropoietin (Epo) for survival and differentiation. The signaling cascade initiated by Epo is critical for this process and proceeds through the following well-established pathway:\n\n1.  Epo binds to the Epo receptor on the cell surface, causing the receptor to dimerize.\n2.  This dimerization activates the associated Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2).\n3.  Active JAK2 phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on the intracellular domain of the Epo receptor.\n4.  A protein called Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5 (STAT5), which contains a Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain and a DNA-Binding Domain (DBD), is recruited to the phosphorylated receptor by binding via its SH2 domain.\n5.  The recruited STAT5 is then phosphorylated by JAK2.\n6.  Phosphorylated STAT5 proteins dissociate from the receptor and form homodimers (STAT5-STAT5) through interactions between their respective SH2 domains and phosphorylated tyrosine residues.\n7.  These functional dimers translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to specific DNA sequences via their DBDs to activate the transcription of target genes, such as the anti-apoptotic gene *Bcl-xL*, which promotes cell survival.\n\nThe researchers transfect these cells to cause high-level expression of a mutant STAT5 protein, which we will call STAT5-DN. This mutant protein has a fully functional SH2 domain but completely lacks its DNA-Binding Domain (DBD). The endogenous, wild-type STAT5 is still present in the cells. When these transfected cells are stimulated with Epo, the researchers observe a significant reduction in the transcription of the *Bcl-xL* gene compared to non-transfected cells.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate molecular explanation for this observed dominant-negative inhibition of Epo-induced gene transcription?\n\nA. The STAT5-DN mutant protein binds permanently to the Epo receptor, preventing the binding and phosphorylation of wild-type STAT5.\n\nB. The STAT5-DN mutant protein dimerizes with itself in the cytoplasm and sequesters the JAK2 kinase, preventing it from associating with the Epo receptor.\n\nC. The STAT5-DN mutant protein cannot bind to DNA, but it is still phosphorylated and forms non-functional heterodimers with wild-type STAT5, preventing the wild-type protein from binding to target gene promoters.\n\nD. The STAT5-DN mutant protein lacks a DNA-binding domain, which also prevents its phosphorylation by JAK2, causing it to accumulate in an inactive state and block the pathway through steric hindrance.\n\nE. The STAT5-DN mutant protein enters the nucleus and binds to an inhibitory co-factor, which then actively represses the transcription of all STAT5 target genes.", "solution": "The Epo signaling pathway requires sequential steps: Epo-induced receptor dimerization activates JAK2, which phosphorylates tyrosines on the Epo receptor. STAT5 is recruited via its SH2 domain to these phosphotyrosines, then phosphorylated by JAK2. Phosphorylated STAT5 forms dimers through SH2–phosphotyrosine interactions, translocates to the nucleus, and binds DNA through its DNA-binding domain (DBD) to drive transcription of target genes such as Bcl-xL.\n\nThe mutant STAT5-DN retains an intact SH2 domain but lacks the DBD. Therefore:\n1. Recruitment: Because the SH2 domain is intact, STAT5-DN can still bind phosphorylated receptor sites, compete with endogenous STAT5 for recruitment, and be phosphorylated by JAK2. Lack of a DBD does not impair JAK2 recognition or phosphorylation, which occur on other STAT5 residues.\n2. Dimerization: Once phosphorylated, STAT5-DN can dimerize via the canonical SH2–phosphotyrosine-mediated interface. It can form both homodimers (STAT5-DN:STAT5-DN) and heterodimers with wild-type STAT5 (STAT5-DN:STAT5-WT).\n3. Nuclear function: DNA binding by STAT dimers requires proper engagement of both monomers with their respective half-sites in GAS elements; loss of the DBD in one partner disrupts stable, sequence-specific binding and transcriptional activation. Thus, heterodimers containing STAT5-DN are non-functional on DNA, and homodimers of STAT5-DN are also non-functional. As a result, STAT5-DN acts in a dominant-negative manner by sequestering wild-type STAT5 into non-productive dimers and reducing the pool of functional STAT5-WT homodimers competent for promoter binding and transcriptional activation.\n4. This mechanism directly explains the reduced Epo-induced Bcl-xL transcription observed despite the presence of endogenous STAT5.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because STAT5 binding to receptor phosphotyrosines via SH2 is transient; phosphorylation triggers dissociation and dimerization rather than permanent receptor occupancy.\n- B is incorrect because STAT5 does not sequester JAK2 in the cytoplasm; JAK2 is receptor-associated, and STAT5 dimerization is phosphorylation-dependent at the receptor.\n- C is correct: STAT5-DN is phosphorylated, forms non-functional heterodimers with wild-type STAT5, and prevents wild-type STAT5 from binding target promoters, yielding dominant-negative inhibition.\n- D is incorrect because loss of the DBD does not prevent phosphorylation by JAK2.\n- E is incorrect because STAT5-DN lacks a DBD and would not specifically bind DNA to recruit repressors to all STAT5 targets; there is no evidence for universal active repression by such a mutant.\n\nThus, the most accurate explanation is formation of non-functional heterodimers that block wild-type STAT5 DNA binding and transcriptional activation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2277393"}, {"introduction": "A common challenge in cell signaling is to untangle the specific roles of closely related proteins, such as different members of the Janus kinase family. This practice guides you through the interpretation of a hypothetical, yet highly realistic, gene-editing experiment. By analyzing the effects of knocking out $JAK1$ and $TYK2$ individually and together, you will apply rigorous logical deduction to determine whether these kinases have essential or redundant roles in interferon signaling [@problem_id:2342414].", "problem": "The Type I Interferon (IFN) signaling pathway is a critical component of the innate immune response to viral infections. The pathway is initiated when a ligand, such as IFN-alpha, binds to a heterodimeric cell surface receptor composed of the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits. This binding event brings two receptor-associated kinases, Janus Kinase 1 (JAK1) and Tyrosine Kinase 2 (TYK2), into close proximity. JAK1 is constitutively associated with IFNAR2, and TYK2 is associated with IFNAR1. The subsequent activation cascade involves phosphorylation of key downstream targets, including the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) protein. Phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1) is a critical step for its dimerization and translocation to the nucleus to activate the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes.\n\nA researcher aims to clarify the specific contributions of JAK1 and TYK2 to STAT1 activation in response to IFN-alpha. Using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 gene editing, the researcher generates three distinct knockout (KO) human cell lines from a wild-type (WT) parental line: a JAK1-KO line, a TYK2-KO line, and a double-knockout (DKO) line lacking both JAK1 and TYK2.\n\nAll four cell lines (WT, JAK1-KO, TYK2-KO, and DKO) are treated with a saturating concentration of IFN-alpha for 15 minutes. Cell lysates are then prepared and analyzed by Western blot to detect the levels of phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1). As a control, the total amount of STAT1 protein was confirmed to be equal across all samples. The observed results are as follows:\n\n- **WT cells:** A strong band corresponding to pSTAT1 is detected.\n- **JAK1-KO cells:** No band corresponding to pSTAT1 is detected.\n- **TYK2-KO cells:** A strong band corresponding to pSTAT1 is detected, with an intensity similar to that of the WT cells.\n- **DKO cells:** No band corresponding to pSTAT1 is detected.\n\nBased solely on these experimental results, what is the most accurate conclusion regarding the roles of JAK1 and TYK2 in IFN-alpha-induced STAT1 phosphorylation?\n\nA. JAK1 and TYK2 are fully redundant, meaning either kinase is sufficient on its own to induce the full STAT1 phosphorylation response.\n\nB. TYK2 is the essential kinase for STAT1 phosphorylation, and an unknown compensatory mechanism involving JAK1 exists.\n\nC. Both JAK1 and TYK2 must be present and active for STAT1 phosphorylation to occur, indicating they function as an obligate heterodimer.\n\nD. JAK1 is essential for STAT1 phosphorylation in response to IFN-alpha, whereas TYK2 is dispensable for this specific signaling output.\n\nE. TYK2 functions primarily to phosphorylate JAK1, and JAK1 is the sole kinase that directly phosphorylates STAT1.", "solution": "- The experimental design tests the requirement of JAK1 and TYK2 for IFN-alpha-induced STAT1 phosphorylation by comparing WT, single KOs, and a double KO, with total STAT1 controlled to be equal.\n- Observations:\n  1) WT shows strong pSTAT1, confirming the pathway is functional under the assay conditions.\n  2) JAK1-KO shows no pSTAT1, indicating that JAK1 is necessary for STAT1 phosphorylation in response to IFN-alpha.\n  3) TYK2-KO shows strong pSTAT1 similar to WT, indicating TYK2 is not necessary for this specific output; JAK1 alone suffices.\n  4) DKO shows no pSTAT1, consistent with the requirement for JAK1 and not adding beyond the JAK1-KO result.\n\n- Logical elimination of options based solely on the data:\n  - A (full redundancy) is false because JAK1-KO eliminates pSTAT1; if fully redundant, TYK2 alone would suffice in JAK1-KO.\n  - B (TYK2 essential) is false because TYK2-KO retains strong pSTAT1.\n  - C (obligate heterodimer requirement) is false because TYK2-KO cells respond, so both are not required simultaneously.\n  - D (JAK1 essential, TYK2 dispensable) is directly supported: absence of JAK1 abolishes signaling; absence of TYK2 does not impair it.\n  - E posits a specific mechanistic hierarchy (TYK2 phosphorylating JAK1 and JAK1 directly phosphorylating STAT1). While compatible with the data, this mechanistic claim is not demonstrated by these results alone; the data only show necessity and dispensability with respect to the STAT1 phosphorylation readout, not direct kinase-substrate relationships.\n\n- Therefore, the most accurate conclusion supported strictly by the presented results is that JAK1 is essential for IFN-alpha-induced STAT1 phosphorylation, whereas TYK2 is dispensable for this specific signaling output.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2342414"}, {"introduction": "Beyond understanding the qualitative wiring of a pathway, a quantitative grasp of its regulation is essential, particularly for therapeutic applications.
