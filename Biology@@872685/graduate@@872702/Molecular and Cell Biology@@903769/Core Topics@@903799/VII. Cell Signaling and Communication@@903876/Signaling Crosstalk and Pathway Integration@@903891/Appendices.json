Protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylates Raf-1 (also called c-Raf) on an inhibitory site, reducing Raf-1’s catalytic efficiency. Consider a minimal, mechanistically grounded model linking these branches and quantify how this cross-inhibition modifies the effective gain of the MAPK pathway and the ERK sensitivity to EGF.\n\nAssume the following experimentally supported bases:\n- Receptor-proximal activation produces a Ras–guanosine triphosphate (Ras-GTP) fraction $r(u)$ that increases monotonically with EGF concentration $u$ and, near steady state, is well-approximated by a receptor occupancy form $r(u) = \\dfrac{u}{K_{R}+u}$, where $K_{R}$ is an apparent half-activation constant.\n- EGF also activates Akt with an activity $a(u)$ that follows a similar saturating form $a(u) = A_{\\max}\\dfrac{u}{K_{A}+u}$, where $A_{\\max}$ is the maximal Akt activity (in arbitrary activity units) and $K_{A}$ is the half-activation constant.\n- Raf-1 contains a single inhibitory phosphorylation site $P$ that is phosphorylated by Akt with an effective first-order rate constant $k_{A}\\,a(u)$ and dephosphorylated by a phosphatase with a first-order rate constant $k_{P}$.

The total concentration of Raf-1 is $[Raf]_{T} = [Raf_{unP}] + [Raf_{P}]$. The fraction of phosphorylated Raf-1 is defined as $f_{P}(u) = \\frac{[Raf_{P}]}{[Raf]_{T}}$.

The result represents the fractional change in ERK activity for a small fractional change in EGF concentration.

Let $E_A$ and $E_B$ be the normalized fractional activation, which we interpret as the probability of activation by ligand $A$ at concentration $x$ and ligand $B$ at concentration $y$, respectively. The probability of the system *not* being activated by ligand $A$ is then $(1 - E_A)$, and by ligand $B$ is $(1 - E_B)$.\n\nThe principle of independence states that the probability of the system not being activated by the combination of ligands is the product of the probabilities of it not being activated by each ligand individually. Let $E_{AB}^{\\mathrm{Bliss}}$ be the predicted combined activation under this assumption. The probability of the system *not* being activated by the combination is $(1 - E_{AB}^{\\mathrm{Bliss}})$. Thus, we can write:\n$$1 - E_{AB}^{\\mathrm{Bliss}} = (1 - E_A(x)) \\cdot (1 - E_B(y))$$\nSolving for $E_{AB}^{\\mathrm{Bliss}}$ yields the expression for Bliss independence:\n$$E_{AB}^{\\mathrm{Bliss}} = 1 - (1 - E_A(x))(1 - E_B(y))$$\nExpanding this expression gives the equivalent form:\n$$E_{AB}^{\\mathrm{Bliss}} = E_A(x) + E_B(y) - E_A(x)E_B(y)$$\n\nNext, we must compute the Bliss deviations, $\\Delta_i = E_{AB,i}^{\\mathrm{obs}} - E_{AB,i}^{\\mathrm{Bliss}}$, for the two given experimental conditions.\n\nFor experiment pair $1$: $(x,y) = (20\\,\\text{nM}, 10\\,\\text{nM})$.\nFirst, we calculate the individual activation levels, $E_A$ and $E_B$.\n$$E_{A,1} = E_A(20) = \\frac{20^2}{50^2 + 20^2} = \\frac{400}{2500 + 400} = \\frac{400}{2900} = \\frac{4}{29}$$\n$$E_{B,1} = E_B(10) = \\frac{10}{20 + 10} = \\frac{10}{30} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nNow, we compute the expected Bliss response:\n$$E_{AB,1}^{\\mathrm{Bliss}} = E_{A,1} + E_{B,1} - E_{A,1}E_{B,1} = \\frac{4}{29} + \\frac{1}{3} - \\left(\\frac{4}{29}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{12+29}{87} - \\frac{4}{87} = \\frac{41}{87} - \\frac{4}{87} = \\frac{37}{87}$$\nThe numerical value is $E_{AB,1}^{\\mathrm{Bliss}} \\approx 0.425287$.\nThe observed response is given as $E_{AB,1}^{\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.420$.

A nonzero Bliss deviation indicates a violation of the statistical independence assumption on which the model is built. However, it does **not** necessarily imply direct biochemical crosstalk (e.g., one pathway's components chemically modifying the other's). Such a deviation can, and often does, arise from the network topology itself, specifically when pathways converge on a common, saturable node.\n\nThe Bliss model implicitly assumes that the capacity of the system to respond to one stimulus is unaffected by its concurrent response to another. This is a reasonable approximation at low signal levels where system components are far from saturation. The small deviation $\\Delta_1$ at low concentrations is consistent with this.\n\nHowever, at high signal levels, as in the second experiment, both pathways strongly drive the shared MAPK output. Any shared component in the pathway, including the final MAPK node itself, has a finite number of molecules and a maximum processing rate (i.e., it is saturable). When both pathways attempt to utilize this limited resource at high intensity, they compete. This competition for a finite resource pool causes the combined effect to be less than the sum of independent probabilities would predict, leading to a negative deviation ($\\Delta  0$). This phenomenon is a form of antagonism that arises from resource limitation, not from direct inhibitory crosstalk. The observed negative deviation $\\Delta_2 = -0.04020$ at high concentrations is a classic signature of such saturation at a shared node. Therefore, a nonzero Bliss deviation is an indicator of pathway interaction, but this interaction can be structural (due to shared, saturable nodes) rather than a direct biochemical crosstalk mechanism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -0.005287  -0.04020 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2964740"}, {"introduction": "The spatial organization of signaling components can have profound and sometimes counter-intuitive effects on pathway integration.

The problem states that the two binding sites on the scaffold are independent. Therefore, the joint probability of $U_A$ binding to the $U$-site and $K_B$ binding to the $K$-site is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$ p_{UA,KB} = p_U(U_A) \\cdot p_K(K_B) $$\nwhere $p_U(U_A)$ is the probability of a scaffold's $U$-site being occupied by $U_A$, and $p_K(K_B)$ is the probability of its $K$-site being occupied by $K_B$.\n\nFollowing the law of mass action for competitive binding at a single site, the probability of a site being occupied by a specific ligand is the ratio of the concentration-to-dissociation-constant term for that ligand to the sum of all such terms for all competitors, plus a term for the unoccupied state (which is $1$). This sum is the partition function for the site.\nFor the $U$-site, which can be empty, bound to $U_A$, or bound to $U_B$, the partition function $Z_U$ is:\n$$ Z_U = 1 + \\frac{[U_A]}{K_{UA}} + \\frac{[U_B]}{K_{UB}} $$\nThe probability of the $U$-site being occupied by $U_A$ is:\n$$ p_U(U_A) = \\frac{\\frac{[U_A]}{K_{UA}}}{Z_U} = \\frac{\\frac{[U_A]}{K_{UA}}}{1 + \\frac{[U_A]}{K_{UA}} + \\frac{[U_B]}{K_{UB}}} $$\nSimilarly, for the $K$-site, which can be empty, bound to $K_A$, or bound to $K_B$, the partition function $Z_K$ is:\n$$ Z_K = 1 + \\frac{[K_A]}{K_{KA}} + \\frac{[K_B]}{K_{KB}} $$\nThe probability of the $K$-site being occupied by $K_B$ is:\n$$ p_K(K_B) = \\frac{\\frac{[K_B]}{K_{KB}}}{Z_K} = \\frac{\\frac{[K_B]}{K_{KB}}}{1 + \\frac{[K_A]}{K_{KA}} + \\frac{[K_B]}{K_{KB}}} $$\nNow, these probability expressions are substituted back into the equation for $S_T^{\\ast}$:\n$$ S_T^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha [U_A][K_B]}{M \\left( \\frac{\\frac{[U_A]}{K_{UA}}}{1 + \\frac{[U_A]}{K_{UA}} + \\frac{[U_B]}{K_{UB}}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\frac{[K_B]}{K_{KB}}}{1 + \\frac{[K_A]}{K_{KA}} + \\frac{[K_B]}{K_{KB}}} \\right)} $$\nThis complex fraction can be simplified. We rearrange the terms:\n$$ S_T^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha [U_A][K_B]}{M} \\left( \\frac{1 + \\frac{[U_A]}{K_{UA}} + \\frac{[U_B]}{K_{UB}}}{\\frac{[U_A]}{K_{UA}}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + \\frac{[K_A]}{K_{KA}} + \\frac{[K_B]}{K_{KB}}}{\\frac{[K_B]}{K_{KB}}} \\right) $$\nThe terms $[U_A]$ and $[K_B]$ in the numerator cancel with the corresponding terms in the denominators of the fractions:\n$$ S_T^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha}{M} \\left( \\frac{1 + \\frac{[U_A]}{K_{UA}} + \\frac{[U_B]}{K_{UB}}}{\\frac{1}{K_{UA}}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + \\frac{[K_A]}{K_{KA}} + \\frac{[K_B]}{K_{KB}}}{\\frac{1}{K_{KB}}} \\right) $$\nMultiplying the terms in the first parenthesis by $K_{UA}$ and the terms in the second parenthesis by $K_{KB}$ gives:\n$$ S_T^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha}{M} \\left( K_{UA} \\left(1 + \\frac{[U_A]}{K_{UA}} + \\frac{[U_B]}{K_{UB}}\\right) \\right) \\left( K_{KB} \\left(1 + \\frac{[K_A]}{K_{KA}} + \\frac{[K_B]}{K_{KB}}\\right) \\right) $$\nDistributing $K_{UA}$ and $K_{KB}$ into their respective parentheses yields the final simplified expression:\n$$ S_T^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha}{M} \\left(K_{UA} + [U_A] + [U_B]\\frac{K_{UA}}{K_{UB}}\\right) \\left(K_{KB} + [K_A]\\frac{K_{KB}}{K_{KA}} + [K_B]\\right) $$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the critical total scaffold concentration $S_T^{\\ast}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{\\alpha}{M} \\left(K_{UA} + [U_A] + [U_B]\\frac{K_{UA}}{K_{UB}}\\right) \\left(K_{KB} + [K_A]\\frac{K_{KB}}{K_{KA}} + [K_B]\\right)} $$", "id": "2964724"}]}
