Variant X carries alanine substitutions in conserved residues across the BRC repeats (BRC-mut) that abolish high-affinity interaction with RAD51 recombinase (RAD51), but retains the C-terminal DNA-binding domain and the C-terminal RAD51-interaction site. Variant Y carries point mutations in the C-terminal oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding folds and tower subdomain that abrogate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding and disrupt interaction with DSS1 protein (deleted in split hand/split foot syndrome), but preserves intact BRC repeats. You are to predict, from first principles, how these domain-specific perturbations differentially impact RAD51 filament dynamics on resected DNA ends and the outcome of homology-directed repair (HDR) at a programmed DNA double-strand break (DSB).\n\nUse only the following foundational facts as your starting base:\n\n- In homologous recombination (HR), end resection generates a $3'$ ssDNA tail that is initially coated by Replication Protein A (RPA). Productive RAD51 filaments must nucleate on RPA-coated ssDNA, displace RPA, and extend to form a competent presynaptic filament capable of homology search and displacement loop (D-loop) formation.\n- BRCA2 contains multiple BRC repeats that bind RAD51 monomers and small oligomers in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-bound state, chaperoning their delivery to ssDNA and suppressing promiscuous binding of RAD51 to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA).\n- The C-terminal DNA-binding domain of BRCA2, together with DSS1, binds ssDNA and dsDNA junctions and stabilizes nascent RAD51 filaments by aiding RPA displacement and capping filament ends; this domain also contributes to protection of stalled replication forks but is not required for defining homology per se.\n- Excess RAD51 in the absence of proper chaperoning can form nonproductive filaments on dsDNA, which are inhibitory or toxic to genome stability.\n\nYou perform the following assays after a site-specific DSB is induced in S phase:\n\n- Single-molecule imaging of RAD51 on resected ssDNA tracks measures the initial nucleation frequency per unit ssDNA, the average filament growth length before catastrophe, and the dwell time of RAD51 clusters.\n- A green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based gene conversion reporter quantifies accurate HDR via synthesis-dependent strand annealing.\n- A single-strand annealing (SSA) reporter quantifies RAD52-dependent end joining between repeats.\n- Chromatin fractionation and immunofluorescence assess RAD51 binding to bulk chromatin (enriched for dsDNA) and the kinetics of RPA persistence at breaks.\n- RAD51 overexpression is used to test for dsDNA misloading toxicity.\n\nWhich option best captures the differential impact of BRC-mut (Variant X) versus DBD-mut (Variant Y) on RAD51 filament dynamics and HDR outcomes, given the foundational facts above?\n\nA. BRC-mut shows near-normal nucleation on ssDNA because the C-terminal DNA-binding domain can recruit RAD51; however, filaments fail to extend without intact BRC repeats, so average growth length and dwell time are reduced. DBD-mut, by contrast, nucleates poorly due to loss of DNA binding, but once nucleated via residual pathways its filaments are unusually stable and long because intact BRC repeats compensate at the extension stage. Both variants reduce gene conversion similarly, with no effect on SSA.\n\nB. Both BRC-mut and DBD-mut equivalently reduce RAD51 nucleation, extension, and stability because either domain is individually sufficient for RAD51 delivery and filament maintenance; consequently, both variants cause indistinguishable decreases in gene conversion with proportional increases in SSA, and neither alters RAD51 misloading onto dsDNA.\n\nC. BRC-mut primarily impairs RAD51 nucleation on RPA-coated ssDNA because the BRC repeats are required to chaperone ATP-bound RAD51 to ssDNA and to suppress dsDNA binding; as a result, early RAD51 focus formation and nucleation frequency are low, RPA persists at breaks, and HDR by gene conversion drops, while RAD51 overexpression exacerbates nonproductive dsDNA binding and toxicity. In contrast, DBD-mut with intact BRC repeats can still chaperone RAD51 and seed initial nucleation events, but defective ssDNA binding and DSS1-dependent stabilization compromise RPA displacement and filament maturation, yielding short, unstable filaments with reduced dwell time and growth before catastrophe. Gene conversion decreases, RPA persists transiently, SSA increases modestly as a compensatory pathway, and dsDNA misloading is not markedly enhanced at baseline because BRC-mediated suppression of dsDNA binding remains.\n\nD. BRC repeats physiologically inhibit RAD51 assembly; therefore, BRC-mut relieves this inhibition, increasing both nucleation and extension of RAD51 filaments and elevating gene conversion. DBD-mut eliminates BRCA2 DNA tethering and thus prevents RAD51 overloading on dsDNA, decreasing toxicity under RAD51 overexpression. Consequently, BRC-mut shows hyper-recombination with reduced SSA, whereas DBD-mut shows a mild HDR defect without changes in filament dynamics.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must deduce the consequences of each mutation based on the provided \"foundational facts\" about BRCA2 domain function.\n\n**Analysis of Variant X (BRC-mut):**\nThis variant lacks the BRC repeats' ability to bind RAD51.\n- According to Fact 2, BRC repeats are essential for chaperoning RAD51 monomers to the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) at a break site. Therefore, BRC-mut will be severely deficient in the initial **nucleation** of the RAD51 filament. This leads to low nucleation frequency, persistence of RPA on the ssDNA, and a drastic drop in homology-directed repair (HDR).\n- Fact 2 also states that BRC repeats suppress promiscuous RAD51 binding to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The BRC-mut will have lost this function, leading to increased nonproductive RAD51 binding to bulk chromatin, which is toxic (Fact 4) and would be worsened by RAD51 overexpression.\n\n**Analysis of Variant Y (DBD-mut):**\nThis variant has intact BRC repeats but a non-functional C-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD).\n- Since the BRC repeats are functional, this variant can still chaperone RAD51 to the DNA break, allowing for the **nucleation** of RAD51 filaments (Fact 2).\n- However, Fact 3 states that the DBD is required to **stabilize** the nascent filament, help displace RPA, and cap the filament. Without this function, the filaments that do form will be unstable, prone to disassembly (catastrophe), and fail to extend properly. This results in short filaments with reduced dwell times.\n- Consequently, HDR will be impaired, though perhaps less severely than with BRC-mut. The suppressive effect on dsDNA binding remains intact due to the functional BRC repeats, so no marked increase in dsDNA misloading is expected.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n- **A** is incorrect because BRC-mut shows impaired, not near-normal, nucleation.\n- **B** is incorrect because the defects are distinct (nucleation vs. stabilization), not equivalent.\n- **C** correctly captures the differential impacts. It identifies the primary defect of BRC-mut as impaired nucleation and loss of dsDNA binding suppression. It correctly identifies the defect of DBD-mut as compromised filament maturation and stability after nucleation. All predicted experimental outcomes align with this analysis.\n- **D** is incorrect because it falsely claims that BRC repeats inhibit RAD51 assembly, which contradicts Fact 2.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the most accurate and comprehensive prediction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2948426"}, {"introduction": "The homologous recombination pathway culminates in the processing of complex DNA intermediates, which ultimately determines the genetic outcome of the repair event.
