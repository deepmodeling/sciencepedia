It is a standard application of Michaelis–Menten kinetics to a system with two competing substrates. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe initial rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, $v$, for a single substrate $S$ is described by the Michaelis–Menten equation:\n$$v = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}} [E]_T [S]}{K_M + [S]}$$\nwhere $[E]_T$ is the total enzyme concentration, $[S]$ is the substrate concentration, $k_{\\text{cat}}$ is the turnover number, and $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant.\n\nIn this problem, we have two substrates competing for the same active site: a correct deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate ($\\text{dNTP}^{\\text{corr}}$) and an incorrect one ($\\text{dNTP}^{\\text{inc}}$). For such a system, the rate of conversion for a specific substrate $S_i$ in the presence of competing substrates $S_j$ is given by the steady-state expression:\n$$v_i = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat},i} [E]_T [S_i]}{K_{M,i} \\left( 1 + \\sum_{j} \\frac{[S_j]}{K_{M,j}} \\right)}$$\nThis equation is derived from the steady-state assumption applied to all enzyme-substrate complexes.

The total fidelity of a DNA polymerase, $F_{\\mathrm{total}}$, can be expressed as the product of the base selection fidelity, $F_{\\mathrm{select}}$, and the proofreading fidelity, $F_{\\mathrm{proof}}$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{total}} = F_{\\mathrm{select}} \\times F_{\\mathrm{proof}}$$\nThe base selection fidelity, $F_{\\mathrm{select}}$, arises from the kinetic discrimination against incorrect nucleotides during the incorporation cycle at the polymerase active site. The rate constants associated with this step ($k_{\\mathrm{close}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{open}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{chem}}$ for correct and incorrect substrates) are therefore relevant only to the calculation of $F_{\\mathrm{select}}$.\n\nThe proofreading fidelity, $F_{\\mathrm{proof}}$, is the factor by which the exonuclease activity reduces the fraction of misincorporations that are ultimately extended and fixed as errors. This depends on the kinetic partitioning of the mismatched DNA primer terminus between the polymerase extension pathway and the exonuclease excision pathway. The problem requires the calculation of this factor, $F_{\\mathrm{proof}}$, alone. Therefore, the rate constants for base selection are not needed for this specific question.\n\nWe model the fate of a newly formed mismatch at the polymerase active site. Let this state be $P_{\\mathrm{mismatch}}$. From this state, the mismatch can either be extended at the polymerase site, fixing the error, or be transferred to the exonuclease site for potential removal.\nThe two competing pathways from $P_{\\mathrm{mismatch}}$ are:\n1. Extension: $P_{\\mathrm{mismatch}} \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{ext}}} \\text{Extended Mismatch}$\n2. Transfer to exonuclease site: $P_{\\mathrm{mismatch}} \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{pe}}} E_{\\mathrm{mismatch}}$\n\nOnce the mismatch is at the exonuclease site, state $E_{\\mathrm{mismatch}}$, it again faces two competing fates:\n1.

Return to polymerase site: $E_{\\mathrm{mismatch}} \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{ep}}} P_{\\mathrm{mismatch}}$\n\nThe proofreading fidelity factor, $F_{\\mathrm{proof}}$, can be derived from the kinetic partitioning between the net rate of error removal and the rate of error fixation. The factor is given by the expression:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{proof}} = 1 + P_c$$\nwhere $P_c$ is the partitioning coefficient, defined as the ratio of the effective rate of excision to the rate of extension.\n\nThe rate of extension is simply $k_{\\mathrm{ext}}$.\nThe effective rate of excision is the rate of transfer to the exonuclease site, $k_{\\mathrm{pe}}$, multiplied by the probability that a mismatch, once at the exonuclease site, is excised rather than returned to the polymerase site. This probability is determined by the competition between the rates $k_{\\mathrm{exo}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{ep}}$.\n$$P(\\text{excision} | \\text{at exo site}) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{exo}}}{k_{\\mathrm{exo}} + k_{\\mathrm{ep}}}$$\nThus, the effective rate of excision is $k_{\\mathrm{pe}} \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{exo}}}{k_{\\mathrm{exo}} + k_{\\mathrm{ep}}} \\right)$.\n\nThe partitioning coefficient $P_c$ is:\n$$P_c = \\frac{\\text{Effective Rate of Excision}}{\\text{Rate of Extension}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{pe}} \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{exo}}}{k_{\\mathrm{exo}} + k_{\\mathrm{ep}}}\\right)}{k_{\\mathrm{ext}}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{pe}} k_{\\mathrm{exo}}}{k_{\\mathrm{ext}}(k_{\\mathrm{exo}} + k_{\\mathrm{ep}})}$$\nThe total fidelity improvement from proofreading is then:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{proof}} = 1 + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{pe}} k_{\\mathrm{exo}}}{k_{\\mathrm{ext}}(k_{\\mathrm{exo}} + k_{\\mathrm{ep}})}$$\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$k_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 2~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{pe}} = 50~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{ep}} = 20~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{exo}} = 200~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\n$$F_{\\mathrm{proof}} = 1 + \\frac{(50)(200)}{(2)(200 + 20)}$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{proof}} = 1 + \\frac{10000}{2(220)}$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{proof}} = 1 + \\frac{10000}{440}$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{proof}} = 1 + \\frac{1000}{44}$$\nDividing both numerator and denominator by $4$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{proof}} = 1 + \\frac{250}{11}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\\frac{250}{11} \\approx 22.7272...$$\nSo,\n$$F_{\\mathrm{proof}} = 1 + 22.7272... = 23.7272...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{proof}} \\approx 23.73$$\nThis dimensionless ratio represents the factor by which the exonuclease proofreading activity increases the overall fidelity of DNA synthesis, beyond the initial discrimination provided by base selection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{23.73}$$", "id": "2963072"}, {"introduction": "Moving from individual enzymatic functions to the integrated replisome, this final practice models the entire replication fork as a coordinated molecular machine.

The duration of this paused phase, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{pause}}$, is given directly as:\n    $$\n    \\tau_{\\mathrm{pause}} = \\tau_{d}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Total Cycle Time**:\n    The total time for one complete cycle, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{cycle}}$, is the sum of the durations of the active and paused phases:\n    $$\n    \\tau_{\\mathrm{cycle}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{active}} + \\tau_{\\mathrm{pause}} = \\frac{L}{v_{h}} + \\tau_{d}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Derivation of Average Velocity ($v_{\\mathrm{avg}}$)**:\n    The average velocity, $v_{\\mathrm{avg}}$, is defined as the total distance advanced divided by the total elapsed time. Over one cycle, the fork advances a distance $L$ in a total time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{cycle}}$. Therefore, the expression for $v_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ is:\n    $$\n    v_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\frac{L}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{cycle}}} = \\frac{L}{\\frac{L}{v_{h}} + \\tau_{d}}\n    $$\n    This expression can be algebraically rearranged to:\n    $$\n    v_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\frac{L v_{h}}{L + v_{h} \\tau_{d}}\n    $$\n    This is the first required analytical expression.\n\n5.  **Derivation of Fractional Stalled Time ($f_{\\mathrm{stall}}$)**:\n    The fractional time that the fork spends paused, $f_{\\mathrm{stall}}$, is the ratio of the paused duration to the total cycle duration:\n    $$\n    f_{\\mathrm{stall}} = \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{pause}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{cycle}}} = \\frac{\\tau_{d}}{\\frac{L}{v_{h}} + \\tau_{d}}\n    $$\n    This can also be rearranged:\n    $$\n    f_{\\mathrm{stall}} = \\frac{v_{h} \\tau_{d}}{L + v_{h} \\tau_{d}}\n    $$\n    This is the second required analytical expression.\n\n6.  **Numerical Evaluation**:\n    We now substitute the given numerical values: $v_{h} = 800 \\text{ bp/s}$, $L = 1.5 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ bp}$, and $\\tau_{d} = 0.4 \\text{ s}$.\n\n    First, we calculate the total cycle time, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{cycle}}$:\n    $$\n    \\tau_{\\mathrm{cycle}} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{3}}{800} + 0.4 = 1.875 + 0.4 = 2.275 \\text{ s}\n    $$\n\n    Next, we calculate the average velocity, $v_{\\mathrm{avg}}$:\n    $$\n    v_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\frac{L}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{cycle}}} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{3}}{2.275} \\approx 659.340659... \\text{ bp/s}\n    $$\n    Rounding to three significant figures, we get:\n    $$\n    v_{\\mathrm{avg}} \\approx 659 \\text{ bp/s}\n    $$\n\n    Finally, we calculate the fractional stalled time, $f_{\\mathrm{stall}}$:\n    $$\n    f_{\\mathrm{stall}} = \\frac{\\tau_{d}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{cycle}}} = \\frac{0.4}{2.275} \\approx 0.175824...\n    $$\n    Rounding to three significant figures, we get:\n    $$\n    f_{\\mathrm{stall}} \\approx 0.176\n    $$\n\nThe numerical results are therefore $v_{\\mathrm{avg}} = 659$ and $f_{\\mathrm{stall}} = 0.176$.
