Let's explore a hypothetical scenario based on their experimental design.\n\nA culture of *E. coli* is grown for many generations in a medium where the sole nitrogen source is the heavy isotope, $^{15}$N. Consequently, all the nitrogen atoms in the bacterial DNA are $^{15}$N. These bacteria are then transferred to a new medium containing only the light isotope, $^{14}$N, as the nitrogen source. They are allowed to grow for a period of time exactly equal to one generation, meaning each cell undergoes a single round of DNA replication.\n\nAfter this single generation, the DNA from the entire bacterial population is extracted, purified, and subjected to cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradient centrifugation. This technique separates macromolecules based on their buoyant density.\n\nInstead of the biologically accurate semiconservative model, assume that DNA replication follows a hypothetical **conservative model**. In this model, the original parental DNA double helix remains entirely intact after serving as a template, and a completely new, separate daughter DNA double helix is synthesized from precursors in the new medium.\n\nWhich of the following descriptions accurately predicts the result observed in the density gradient tube after centrifugation under this hypothetical conservative replication model?\n\nA. Two distinct bands of DNA of equal intensity: one at a high density corresponding to pure $^{15}$N DNA, and one at a lower density corresponding to pure $^{14}$N DNA.\n\nB. A single band of DNA at an intermediate density, located precisely halfway between the densities of pure $^{15}$N DNA and pure $^{14}$N DNA.\n\nC. A single, very broad band of DNA, spreading continuously from the intermediate density position to the light ($^{14}$N) density position.\n\nD. A single distinct band of DNA at a low density corresponding to pure $^{14}$N DNA.\n\nE. Two distinct bands of DNA: one at a high density corresponding to pure $^{15}$N DNA, and one at an intermediate density.", "solution": "We begin with bacteria whose DNA contains only the heavy isotope $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$; thus all DNA duplexes are heavy-heavy (denote these as HH) and band at a high buoyant density $\\rho_{H}$ in a CsCl gradient.\n\nUnder the hypothetical conservative replication model, the defining principle is that the original parental double helix remains intact after replication and a completely new daughter double helix is synthesized from available precursors. After transfer to a medium containing only $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$, all newly synthesized nitrogen is light, so new DNA is light-light (denote these as LL) and bands at a lower buoyant density $\\rho_{L}$.\n\nConsider $N$ initial HH duplexes. After one generation (one round of replication), conservative replication yields, for each initial HH duplex, one unchanged HH duplex (the parental molecule) and one newly synthesized LL duplex. Therefore, the total DNA after one generation consists of $N$ HH duplexes and $N$ LL duplexes, i.e.,\n$$\n\\text{HH count} = N, \\quad \\text{LL count} = N, \\quad \\text{total} = 2N.\n$$\nNo hybrid heavy-light (HL) duplexes are produced under conservative replication, so there is no DNA at any intermediate density $\\rho_{I}$ between $\\rho_{H}$ and $\\rho_{L}$.\n\nIn CsCl density gradient centrifugation, DNA separates by buoyant density; thus HH duplexes band at $\\rho_{H}$ and LL duplexes band at $\\rho_{L}$. Because there are equal numbers (and hence equal total mass) of HH and LL duplexes of the same length, the two bands have equal intensity.\n\nTherefore, the expected observation is two distinct bands of equal intensity: one at the high density corresponding to pure $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ DNA (HH) and one at the low density corresponding to pure $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ DNA (LL), which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2075384"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the semiconservative model requires delving into the molecular machinery that executes it, particularly the different processes on the leading and lagging strands. This problem explores the consequences of removing a single, critical enzyme—DNA ligase—from the replication process. Analyzing this hypothetical scenario allows you to dissect the steps of lagging strand synthesis and clarify the distinct roles of polymerases, primer removal, and ligation in creating a continuous DNA strand [@problem_id:2075410].", "problem": "In an experimental study, a special eukaryotic cell line is developed that possesses a temperature-sensitive mutation in the gene encoding for DNA ligase. At a permissive temperature of 30°C, the cells grow and divide normally. However, when shifted to a restrictive temperature of 42°C, the DNA ligase enzyme becomes completely non-functional, while all other proteins involved in DNA replication, such as DNA polymerases and helicases, remain fully functional.\n\nA culture of these cells, synchronized at the beginning of the S phase (the DNA synthesis phase of the cell cycle), is shifted to the restrictive temperature of 42°C. The cells are then allowed to complete exactly one round of semiconservative DNA replication. Assuming all other necessary replication steps (initiation, elongation, primer removal, and gap filling) proceed to completion, which of the following statements most accurately describes the state of the newly synthesized lagging strand in these cells?\n\nA. A single, continuous strand of newly synthesized DNA, identical to what would be found in a wild-type cell.\n\nB. Multiple short DNA segments, each containing a short stretch of RNA at its 5' end.\n\nC.

Cells are synchronized at the start of S phase and permitted exactly one round of semiconservative replication. We are to infer the state of the newly synthesized lagging strand under these conditions.\n\nBy the principle of semiconservative replication, each daughter duplex comprises one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand. On the lagging strand template, DNA synthesis proceeds discontinuously as Okazaki fragments. The standard sequence of steps for lagging-strand synthesis is:\n1. Primase synthesizes short RNA primers to provide free $3'$-hydroxyl ends.\n2. DNA polymerase extends from each RNA primer to synthesize DNA fragments (Okazaki fragments).\n3. RNA primers are removed (e.g., by RNase H and FEN1), leaving gaps where the RNA was.\n4. DNA polymerase fills these gaps with DNA.\n5. DNA ligase catalyzes formation of the missing phosphodiester bonds, joining adjacent DNA fragments by sealing nicks between a $3'$-hydroxyl and a $5'$-phosphate.\n\nThe key enzymatic function of DNA ligase is to seal these nicks by forming covalent phosphodiester bonds, typically using ATP as an energy source. If DNA ligase is nonfunctional, then step 5 cannot occur. The prompt additionally specifies that primer removal and gap filling proceed to completion, which implies that after step 4, all RNA primers have been removed and replaced with DNA, leaving only nicks between adjacent DNA fragments.\n\nTherefore, in the absence of ligase, the lagging strand will consist of multiple discrete DNA segments (Okazaki fragments that have had their RNA primers removed and their gaps filled with DNA) that are aligned adjacent to each other on the template but are not covalently joined into a single continuous polymer. There will be no residual RNA at the $5'$ ends (ruling out options that include RNA), replication will still proceed (ruling out complete failure), and the strand will not be continuous without ligation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because without ligase, the lagging strand cannot be a single continuous polymer.\n- B is incorrect because primer removal and gap filling are specified to be complete, so RNA is absent.\n- C is incorrect because replication can proceed; only the ligation step fails.\n- D is correct: multiple adjacent DNA fragments remain unligated (nicks persist).\n- E is incorrect because there is no RNA remaining after complete primer removal and gap filling.\n\nThus, the most accurate description is multiple discrete DNA segments that are adjacent but not covalently joined.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2075410"}, {"introduction": "A key skill in modern molecular biology is the ability to build quantitative models that connect molecular events to observable, population-level phenomena.

All newly synthesized DNA strands are therefore \"light\". Replication is semiconservative, meaning each new duplex consists of one old template strand and one new strand. The problem specifies that $t_p < \\tau_d$ and no locus undergoes a second round of replication. This implies that the only replication events occurring are the conversion of HH DNA to HL DNA. The formation of LL DNA, which would require the replication of HL templates, does not occur within the time frame $t_p$. Thus, for all $t$ in the interval $[0, t_p]$, we have $M_{LL}(t) = 0$.\n\nThe total mass of DNA synthesized over the time interval $[0, t_p]$ is the increase in total DNA mass:\n$$\\Delta M_{syn}(t_p) = M(t_p) - M(0) = M_0 \\exp(\\mu t_p) - M_0 = M_0 (\\exp(\\mu t_p) - 1)$$\nThis newly synthesized mass, $\\Delta M_{syn}(t_p)$, consists entirely of light strands.\n\nAccording to the stoichiometry of semiconservative replication, the synthesis of new strands requires an equal mass of template strands.
