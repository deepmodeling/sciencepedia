It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, we proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the net mean elongation rate, $\\frac{dn}{dt}$, for a single actin filament barbed end. The process is governed by the reversible reaction:\n$$F_{n} + G \\rightleftharpoons F_{n+1}$$\nwhere $F_{n}$ is an actin filament with $n$ subunits, $G$ is a globular actin (G-actin) monomer, and $F_{n+1}$ is the filament with one additional subunit.\n\nThe problem states that subunit addition and dissociation are independent Poisson processes. The rate of a Poisson process gives the expected number of events per unit time. The net rate of change in the number of subunits, which we denote as the mean elongation rate $\\frac{dn}{dt}$, is the difference between the rate of addition events ($R_{\\text{on}}$) and the rate of dissociation events ($R_{\\text{off}}$).\n$$ \\frac{dn}{dt} = R_{\\text{on}} - R_{\\text{off}} $$\nWe must determine these rates based on mass-action kinetics.\n\nThe forward reaction, $F_{n} + G \\to F_{n+1}$, describes the addition of a G-actin monomer to the filament end. This is a bimolecular reaction. The rate of this reaction for a single filament end is proportional to the concentration of free G-actin, $[G\\text{-actin}]$. The proportionality constant is the on-rate constant, $k_{\\text{on}}^{+}$. Thus, the rate of addition, in units of subunits per second, is:\n$$ R_{\\text{on}} = k_{\\text{on}}^{+} [G\\text{-actin}] $$\nThe units are consistent: $( \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1} ) \\times ( \\mu\\mathrm{M} ) = \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which represents the frequency of association events.\n\nThe reverse reaction, $F_{n+1} \\to F_{n} + G$, describes the dissociation of a subunit from the filament end. This is a unimolecular, or first-order, process. Its rate depends only on the existence of the filament end from which a subunit can dissociate. The rate is given by the off-rate constant, $k_{\\text{off}}^{+}$, which has units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$$ R_{\\text{off}} = k_{\\text{off}}^{+} $$\nThis constant directly represents the frequency of dissociation events.\n\nCombining these two rates, we obtain the general expression for the net mean elongation rate of the barbed end:\n$$ \\frac{dn}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}^{+} [G\\text{-actin}] - k_{\\text{off}}^{+} $$\nThis is the required expression.\n\nNow, we must evaluate this rate using the provided numerical values:\n$$ k_{\\text{on}}^{+} = 11\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ k_{\\text{off}}^{+} = 1.4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ [G\\text{-actin}] = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} $$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$ \\frac{dn}{dt} = (11\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) - 1.4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nFirst, we calculate the addition rate, $R_{\\text{on}}$:\n$$ R_{\\text{on}} = 11 \\times 2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 22\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe dissociation rate, $R_{\\text{off}}$, is given as:\n$$ R_{\\text{off}} = 1.4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe net elongation rate is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{dn}{dt} = 22\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} - 1.4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 20.6\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe net elongation rate is $20.6$ subunits per second.\n\nFinally, we must determine the behavior of the filament end based on the sign of this rate. Since $\\frac{dn}{dt} = 20.6 > 0$, the rate is positive. A positive rate signifies that the rate of subunit addition is greater than the rate of subunit dissociation.

Since we are interested in compressive force, we assume $F > 0$. The equation becomes:\n$$y'''' + k^2 y'' = 0$$\nThis is a fourth-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. The characteristic equation is $r^4 + k^2 r^2 = 0$, which factors as $r^2(r^2 + k^2) = 0$. The roots are $r = 0$ with multiplicity $2$, and $r = \\pm ik$.

Again, since $k \\neq 0$, this implies $C_1 \\sin(kL) = 0$.\n\nNow the system of equations for the coefficients has been reduced. We have $C_2=0$ and $C_4=0$.

Thus $a^\\ast_{\\text{BIOCHEM,C}} \\approx \\dfrac{0.3846153846}{0.6} \\approx 0.6410256410$.\n\nCase D: $(m,\\eta) = (2.0, 0.0)$.\n- PULL: $v_r = 0.1 + 0.4 \\cdot 2.0 \\cdot 0.0 = 0.1$. Denominator $= 0.5 + 0.1 = 0.6$. Thus $a^\\ast_{\\text{PULL,D}} = \\dfrac{1.0}{0.6} = 1.6666666667$.\n- BIOCHEM: numerator unchanged from Case C, $0.3846153846$, denominator $= 0.6$. Thus $a^\\ast_{\\text{BIOCHEM,D}} \\approx 0.6410256410$.\n\nAs a computational experiment to distinguish mechanisms, examine whether reducing adhesion coupling $\\eta$ at high myosin activity rescues actin density:\n- In PULL, comparing Case C to Case D, decreasing $\\eta$ from $1.0$ to $0.0$ at $m = 2.0$ increases $a^\\ast$ from approximately $0.7142857143$ to approximately $1.6666666667$, a substantial rescue driven by reduced advection.\n- In BIOCHEM, the same change in $\\eta$ does not affect $a^\\ast$ (both Cases C and D yield approximately $0.6410256410$), because assembly suppression is independent of adhesion-mediated flow.\n\nHence, the computed steady-state densities across the test suite provide a quantitative signature to discriminate advection-mediated PULL coupling from BIOCHEM assembly suppression.\n\nThe final program output should therefore be the single-line list:\n$[1.6666666667, 1.6666666667, 1.25, 1.1904761905, 0.7142857143, 0.6410256410, 1.6666666667, 0.6410256410]$, up to standard floating-point representation.", "answer": "```python\n# Python 3.12\n# Allowed libraries: numpy 1.23.5, scipy 1.11.4 (not used here)\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef steady_state_pull(m, eta, params):\n    kp, kc, koff, v0, beta, L = params[\"kp\"], params[\"kc\"], params[\"koff\"], params[\"v0\"], params[\"beta\"], params[\"L\"]\n    vr = v0 + beta * m * eta\n    denom = kc + koff + vr / L\n    return kp / denom\n\ndef steady_state_biochem(m, eta, params):\n    kp, kc, koff, v0, L, s = params[\"kp\"], params[\"kc\"], params[\"koff\"], params[\"v0\"], params[\"L\"], params[\"s\"]\n    vr = v0  # independent of m and eta\n    denom = kc + koff + vr / L\n    numerator = kp / (1.0 + s * m)\n    return numerator / denom\n\ndef solve():\n    # Fixed parameters (dimensionless)\n    params = {\n        \"kp\": 1.0,\n        \"kc\": 0.3,\n        \"koff\": 0.2,\n        \"v0\": 0.1,\n        \"beta\": 0.4,\n        \"L\": 1.0,\n        \"s\": 0.8,\n    }\n\n    # Test suite: list of (m, eta)\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.0, 1.0),  # Case A\n        (0.5, 1.0),  # Case B\n        (2.0, 1.0),  # Case C\n        (2.0, 0.0),  # Case D\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for m, eta in test_cases:\n        a_pull = steady_state_pull(m, eta, params)\n        a_biochem = steady_state_biochem(m, eta, params)\n        results.append(a_pull)\n        results.append(a_biochem)\n\n    # Print single-line output in the required format\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```", "id": "2940652"}]}
