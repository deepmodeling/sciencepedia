It is scientifically grounded in established principles of molecular and cell biology, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of parameters, and formulated objectively. All necessary information for a unique solution is provided. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part calculation. First, we determine the number of $\\gamma$-tubulin ring complexes, $N_{\\mathrm{TuRC}}$, from calibrated fluorescence intensity. Second, we determine the total microtubule nucleation rate, $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, from the observed rate of EB comet appearance. Finally, we combine these to compute the per-complex nucleation rate, $k_{\\mathrm{fire}}$.\n\nThe total integrated fluorescence intensity at the centrosome, $I_{\\mathrm{cen}}$, is proportional to the number of fluorophores present. The number of fluorophores is not equal to the total number of $\\gamma$-tubulin molecules, $N_{\\gamma}^{\\mathrm{tot}}$, due to several factors. We must account for the fraction of molecules that are tagged with GFP, $f_{\\mathrm{tag}}$; the fraction of GFP that has matured into a fluorescent state, $f_{\\mathrm{mat}}$; and a local environmental factor, $q$, that alters the brightness of a single GFP molecule relative to its calibrated brightness, $I_{\\mathrm{GFP}}$.\n\nThe number of fluorescently active GFP molecules at the centrosome is $N_{\\gamma}^{\\mathrm{tot}} \\times f_{\\mathrm{tag}} \\times f_{\\mathrm{mat}}$.\nThe effective brightness of a single one of these molecules at the centrosome is $I_{\\mathrm{GFP}} \\times q$.\nThus, the total measured intensity is the product of these two quantities:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{cen}} = (N_{\\gamma}^{\\mathrm{tot}} f_{\\mathrm{tag}} f_{\\mathrm{mat}}) (I_{\\mathrm{GFP}} q)$$\nWe solve for the total number of $\\gamma$-tubulin molecules, $N_{\\gamma}^{\\mathrm{tot}}$:\n$$N_{\\gamma}^{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{cen}}}{I_{\\mathrm{GFP}} f_{\\mathrm{tag}} f_{\\mathrm{mat}} q}$$\nNext, we determine the number of $\\gamma$-tubulin ring complexes, $N_{\\mathrm{TuRC}}$. The problem states that a fraction $f_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ of the total centrosomal $\\gamma$-tubulin is incorporated into these complexes. The number of $\\gamma$-tubulin molecules in complexes is therefore $N_{\\gamma}^{\\mathrm{tot}} \\times f_{\\mathrm{ring}}$. Since each complex contains $s_{\\gamma}$ subunits of $\\gamma$-tubulin, the number of complexes is:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{TuRC}} = \\frac{N_{\\gamma}^{\\mathrm{tot}} f_{\\mathrm{ring}}}{s_{\\gamma}} = \\left( \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{cen}}}{I_{\\mathrm{GFP}} f_{\\mathrm{tag}} f_{\\mathrm{mat}} q} \\right) \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{ring}}}{s_{\\gamma}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$I_{\\mathrm{cen}} = 1.7556 \\times 10^{7}$\n$I_{\\mathrm{GFP}} = 5.00 \\times 10^{3}$\n$f_{\\mathrm{tag}} = 0.95$\n$f_{\\mathrm{mat}} = 0.80$\n$q = 0.88$\n$f_{\\mathrm{ring}} = 0.80$\n$s_{\\gamma} = 14$\n\nFirst, we calculate $N_{\\gamma}^{\\mathrm{tot}}$:\n$$N_{\\gamma}^{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\frac{1.7556 \\times 10^{7}}{(5.00 \\times 10^{3})(0.95)(0.80)(0.88)} = \\frac{1.7556 \\times 10^{7}}{3344} = 5250$$\nNow, we calculate $N_{\\mathrm{TuRC}}$:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{TuRC}} = \\frac{N_{\\gamma}^{\\mathrm{tot}} f_{\\mathrm{ring}}}{s_{\\gamma}} = \\frac{5250 \\times 0.80}{14} = \\frac{4200}{14} = 300$$\nThere are precisely $300$ $\\gamma$-TuRCs per centrosome according to these data.\n\nThe second task is to compute the per-complex nucleation rate, $k_{\\mathrm{fire}}$. The problem states that the appearance of a new EB comet corresponds one-to-one with a microtubule nucleation event. The observed rate of comet appearance is $R_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 1.44 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. This observed rate is an underestimate due to imperfect detection, with a detection probability of $f_{\\mathrm{det}} = 0.60$.\nThe total nucleation rate, $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is therefore:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{obs}}}{f_{\\mathrm{det}}}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\frac{1.44 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.60} = 2.4 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe per-γ-TuRC nucleation rate, $k_{\\mathrm{fire}}$, is the total nucleation rate divided by the number of $\\gamma$-TuRCs.

Phosphorylation at this site promotes release of $\\gamma$-TuRC from PCM, decreasing centrosomal docking in the phospho-mimetic mutant and increasing cytosolic nucleation efficiency to compensate.", "solution": "We begin from three foundational points. First, centrosomal microtubule nucleation is mediated by pericentriolar material (PCM)-docked $\\gamma$-tubulin ring complex ($\\gamma$-TuRC) particles. Second, the total nucleation output of an MTOC in a given time interval is proportional to the number of docked $\\gamma$-TuRC particles, here denoted $N_{\\text{bound}}$, times the average nucleation rate per docked particle, denoted $k_{\\text{nuc}}$. Thus, if $k_{\\text{nuc}}$ is unchanged, changes in output reflect changes in $N_{\\text{bound}}$. Third, protein phosphorylation often regulates binding affinity to scaffolds (affecting $N_{\\text{bound}}$) without necessarily altering the catalytic performance of a complex (affecting $k_{\\text{nuc}}$).\n\nWe now interpret each measurement in light of these principles:\n\n1. Centrosomal $\\gamma$-tubulin intensity serves as a proxy for $N_{\\text{bound}}$. The values WT $= 100$, S$\\rightarrow$A $= 40$, and S$\\rightarrow$E $= 180$ indicate that S$\\rightarrow$A reduces and S$\\rightarrow$E increases $N_{\\text{bound}}$ relative to WT.\n\n2.

Increased PCM area typically provides more docking capacity for $\\gamma$-TuRC, consistent with higher $N_{\\text{bound}}$ in S$\\rightarrow$E, and the converse for S$\\rightarrow$A.\n\n3. The TIRF single-particle nucleation assay directly estimates $k_{\\text{nuc}}$, with WT $= 1.00$, S$\\rightarrow$A $= 0.98$, S$\\rightarrow$E $= 1.05$ events per particle per minute. These are essentially indistinguishable within experimental variability, arguing that intrinsic per-particle catalytic nucleation activity is not materially changed by either mutation.\n\n4. FRAP measurements of $\\gamma$-TuRC turnover at centrosomes (mobile fraction WT $= 0.50$, S$\\rightarrow$A $= 0.80$, S$\\rightarrow$E $= 0.30$) indicate that S$\\rightarrow$E strengthens binding (lower mobile fraction, longer residence), while S$\\rightarrow$A weakens binding (higher mobile fraction, shorter residence). This directly implicates phosphorylation as a positive regulator of PCM docking stability.\n\n5. Cold-induced regrowth yields WT $= 1000$, S$\\rightarrow$A $= 400$, S$\\rightarrow$E $= 1800$ microtubules per centrosome after $2\\,\\text{min}$. These totals scale with centrosomal $\\gamma$-tubulin intensity (proxy for $N_{\\text{bound}}$): the ratios S$\\rightarrow$A:WT:S$\\rightarrow$E are approximately $40:100:180$ for intensity and $400:1000:1800$ for microtubule number, consistent with similar $k_{\\text{nuc}}$ but different $N_{\\text{bound}}$.\n\n6. Cytosolic $\\gamma$-TuRC abundance and assembly state are indistinguishable across genotypes, ruling out a defect in particle assembly or total supply.\n\nWe can formalize the consistency check. Let $N_{\\text{bound}}^{\\text{WT}} \\propto 100$, $N_{\\text{bound}}^{\\text{S}\\rightarrow\\text{A}} \\propto 40$, $N_{\\text{bound}}^{\\text{S}\\rightarrow\\text{E}} \\propto 180$. With $k_{\\text{nuc}}^{\\text{WT}} \\approx k_{\\text{nuc}}^{\\text{S}\\rightarrow\\text{A}} \\approx k_{\\text{nuc}}^{\\text{S}\\rightarrow\\text{E}} \\approx 1$, the predicted relative total nucleation outputs are $40:100:180$, matching the observed microtubule numbers $400:1000:1800$ up to a common proportionality constant. This alignment strongly supports a docking-based mechanism.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Phosphorylation increases affinity for PCM scaffolds, increasing $N_{\\text{bound}}$ without changing $k_{\\text{nuc}}$. This matches all observations: higher centrosomal $\\gamma$-tubulin and PCM area in S$\\rightarrow$E, lower in S$\\rightarrow$A; unchanged per-particle nucleation in TIRF; FRAP indicates stabilized binding in S$\\rightarrow$E and destabilized binding in S$\\rightarrow$A; microtubule regrowth scales with $N_{\\text{bound}}$. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. Phosphorylation reduces intrinsic $k_{\\text{nuc}}$ while leaving docking unaffected. This is contradicted by TIRF data (per-particle rates are unchanged) and by changes in centrosomal $\\gamma$-tubulin intensity and FRAP that demonstrate altered docking. If docking were unaffected, centrosomal intensity and PCM residency would be similar across genotypes, which is not observed. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. Phosphorylation disrupts cytosolic $\\gamma$-TuRC assembly, lowering particle abundance. Size-exclusion chromatography shows indistinguishable cytosolic assembly and abundance across genotypes, arguing against this. Moreover, the coordinated changes in FRAP and centrosomal intensity are docking phenomena, not assembly defects. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. Phosphorylation promotes release from PCM, decreasing $N_{\\text{bound}}$ in the phospho-mimetic and increasing cytosolic nucleation. The data show the opposite: S$\\rightarrow$E has increased centrosomal intensity, larger PCM area, reduced mobile fraction (stronger retention), and higher total nucleation output at centrosomes. No increase in cytosolic activity is observed in TIRF beyond small, likely noise-level differences. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is that phosphorylation at the tested site enhances PCM docking/retention of $\\gamma$-TuRC (or its associated $\\gamma$-tubulin complex proteins), thereby tuning nucleation output by changing the number of docked complexes rather than their per-particle activity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2954055"}, {"introduction": "To understand how molecular events build cellular structures, we can use biophysical models to connect microscopic rates to macroscopic properties.
