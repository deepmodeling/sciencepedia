[@problem_id:2343479]", "problem": "A hypothetical regulatory protein, known as \"Shuttling Factor Zeta\" (SFZ), is essential for cell cycle progression. SFZ is known to be a shuttling protein, meaning it is continuously transported between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This movement is mediated by two distinct peptide sequences within its structure: a Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) that facilitates import into the nucleus, and a Nuclear Export Signal (NES) that facilitates export to the cytoplasm. In a healthy cell, SFZ is observed to be at a dynamic steady-state, with a significant concentration in both compartments.\n\nThis bidirectional transport through the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) is an active process. Import is mediated by importin receptors, and export is mediated by exportin receptors. The directionality of transport is governed by the state of the small G-protein Ran, which is predominantly bound to Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) in the nucleus and Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) in the cytoplasm.\n\nA researcher treats the cells with a novel, highly specific drug called \"Inhibit-X\". This drug functions by completely and irreversibly blocking the ability of the exportin receptor to bind to the NES of SFZ. All other cellular processes, including protein synthesis, the NLS-mediated import pathway, and the Ran-GTP/GDP cycle, remain unaffected.\n\nAssuming the cells are treated for a sufficiently long time to reach a new steady state, which of the following statements best describes the final distribution of the SFZ protein?\n\nA. SFZ will be found exclusively in the cytoplasm.\n\nB. SFZ will be found predominantly in the nucleus.\n\nC. SFZ will be distributed approximately equally between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.\n\nD. SFZ will accumulate at the nuclear envelope, bound within the NPC.\n\nE. The total amount of SFZ will decrease to near zero as it is unable to function and is targeted for degradation.", "solution": "We model SFZ shuttling between cytoplasm and nucleus as an active, receptor-mediated bidirectional transport with linear kinetics. Let $N_{c}(t)$ and $N_{n}(t)$ denote the amounts of SFZ in cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively, and let $N_{T}=N_{c}+N_{n}$ denote the total SFZ, with other cellular processes (including the Ran-GTP/GDP gradient, import by importins, protein synthesis, and basal turnover) unchanged by the drug, as stated.\n\nIn a healthy cell, import is mediated by importin binding to the NLS and export is mediated by exportin binding to the NES, with directionality determined by Ran such that cargo-exportin-RanGTP complexes form in the nucleus and disassemble in the cytoplasm. We model the net import and export fluxes as\n$$\nJ_{\\text{in}}=k_{\\text{in}}N_{c},\\qquad J_{\\text{out}}=k_{\\text{out}}N_{n},\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\text{in}}0$ reflects NLS/importin-mediated import and $k_{\\text{out}}0$ reflects NES/exportin-mediated export.

This eliminates the ability to form the export complex, so $k_{\\text{out}}=0$ while $k_{\\text{in}}$ remains unchanged. The dynamics reduce to\n$$\n\\frac{dN_{n}}{dt}=k_{\\text{in}}N_{c},\\qquad \\frac{dN_{c}}{dt}=-k_{\\text{in}}N_{c}.\n$$\nWith $N_{T}$ conserved (no net change in total SFZ content due to the drug’s specificity), we have $N_{c}(t)\\to 0$ and $N_{n}(t)\\to N_{T}$ as $t\\to\\infty$. Thus, in the absence of export, SFZ accumulates in the nucleus.\n\nIf we include ongoing protein synthesis in the cytoplasm at rate $S$ and basal cytoplasmic degradation at rate $\\delta N_{c}$ (unchanged by the drug), the cytoplasmic balance becomes\n$$\n\\frac{dN_{c}}{dt}=-k_{\\text{in}}N_{c}+S-\\delta N_{c}.\n$$\nAt steady state with $k_{\\text{out}}=0$, this yields\n$$\nN_{c}^{\\ast}=\\frac{S}{k_{\\text{in}}+\\delta},\\qquad N_{n}^{\\ast}=N_{T}-N_{c}^{\\ast}.\n$$\nBecause import remains active and export is eliminated, $N_{c}^{\\ast}$ is minimized and $N_{n}^{\\ast}$ is maximized; SFZ is therefore predominantly nuclear. This analysis rules out the alternatives: not cytoplasmic (A), not equal distribution (C), no accumulation at the NPC because the NPC is not blocked and import proceeds (D), and no necessary decrease in total SFZ since the drug is specific to exportin binding and does not target SFZ for degradation (E).

The fold-increase for a single hotspot substitution is $\\approx 41.0$. Since $7.59  41.0$, the double non-hotspot mutation is indeed less damaging to binding affinity than a single hotspot mutation. Both components of the statement hold.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Any single $\\mathrm{L} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{A}$ substitution has approximately the same effect on $K_d$ because NES recognition by CRM1 depends primarily on the number of leucines rather than their positions.**\nThis statement contradicts the fundamental premise of the model, which is the existence of \"hotspot\" pockets that contribute disproportionately to binding. Our calculations show a $\\approx 3$-fold increase in $K_d$ for a non-hotspot mutation versus a $\\approx 41$-fold increase for a hotspot mutation. These effects are substantially different, differing by a factor of $\\approx 14$. The statement is therefore false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E.
