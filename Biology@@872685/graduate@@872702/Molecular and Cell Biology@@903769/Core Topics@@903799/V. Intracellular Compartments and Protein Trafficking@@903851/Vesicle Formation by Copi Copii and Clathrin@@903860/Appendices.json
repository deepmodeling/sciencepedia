Consider a minimal energetic model in which the membrane bending energy is described by the Helfrich Hamiltonian with zero spontaneous curvature and zero surface tension, and the coat contributes a constant binding free energy density per unit membrane area.

It employs the Helfrich Hamiltonian, a standard and fundamental model in the biophysics of membranes. The concepts of bending modulus, binding energy, and vesicle geometry are central to the study of cellular processes like endocytosis and secretion. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear objective. The language is precise and objective. The numerical values provided are physically realistic for typical lipid bilayers and protein coats. The problem is a standard, non-trivial calculation in theoretical biophysics. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe total free energy change, $\\Delta E_{\\text{total}}$, for forming a coated vesicle from a flat membrane patch is the sum of the bending energy cost, $\\Delta E_{\\text{bend}}$, and the free energy gain from coat protein binding, $E_{\\text{bind}}$.\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta E_{\\text{bend}} + E_{\\text{bind}}\n$$\nFirst, we determine the bending energy cost, $\\Delta E_{\\text{bend}}$. The Helfrich Hamiltonian for bending energy, $E_{\\text{bend}}$, under the specified conditions (zero spontaneous curvature, $H_0=0$, and negligible Gaussian curvature contribution) is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{bend}} = \\int 2\\kappa H^2 dA\n$$\nwhere $H$ is the local mean curvature and the integral is over the membrane surface area $A$.\n\nThe initial state is a flat membrane patch. For a flat surface, the mean curvature is $H_{\\text{flat}}=0$. Therefore, its bending energy is $E_{\\text{bend, flat}} = 0$.\n\nThe final state is a spherical vesicle of radius $R$. For a sphere, the mean curvature is uniform across the surface, given by $H_{\\text{ves}} = \\frac{1}{R}$. The surface area is $A_{\\text{ves}} = 4\\pi R^2$. The bending energy of the spherical vesicle is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{bend, ves}} = \\int_{\\text{sphere}} 2\\kappa \\left(\\frac{1}{R}\\right)^2 dA = \\frac{2\\kappa}{R^2} \\int_{\\text{sphere}} dA = \\frac{2\\kappa}{R^2} (4\\pi R^2) = 8\\pi\\kappa\n$$\nThis is a classic result. The bending energy cost to deform a flat patch into a sphere is the difference between the final and initial bending energies:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{bend}} = E_{\\text{bend, ves}} - E_{\\text{bend, flat}} = 8\\pi\\kappa - 0 = 8\\pi\\kappa\n$$\nNext, we consider the free energy contribution from the coat binding.

Substituting $A_{\\text{ves}} = 4\\pi R^2$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{bind}} = g_c\\,\\phi\\,(4\\pi R^2) = 4\\pi g_c \\phi R^2\n$$\nThe net free energy change is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{total}} = 8\\pi\\kappa + 4\\pi g_c \\phi R^2\n$$\nWe are required to find the minimal coat coverage, $\\phi_{\\min}$, for which this net energy change is zero. We set $\\Delta E_{\\text{total}} = 0$:\n$$\n8\\pi\\kappa + 4\\pi g_c \\phi_{\\min} R^2 = 0\n$$\nNow, we solve for $\\phi_{\\min}$:\n$$\n4\\pi g_c \\phi_{\\min} R^2 = -8\\pi\\kappa\n$$\n$$\n\\phi_{\\min} = \\frac{-8\\pi\\kappa}{4\\pi g_c R^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\phi_{\\min} = -\\frac{2\\kappa}{g_c R^2}\n$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the minimal coat coverage fraction.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values: $\\kappa=20\\,k_B T$, $g_c=-0.02\\,k_B T/\\mathrm{nm}^2$, and $R=40\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n$$\n\\phi_{\\min} = -\\frac{2(20\\,k_B T)}{(-0.02\\,k_B T/\\mathrm{nm}^2) (40\\,\\mathrm{nm})^2}\n$$\nThe units of energy ($k_B T$) and length squared ($\\mathrm{nm}^2$) cancel, as expected for a dimensionless fraction.\n$$\n\\phi_{\\min} = -\\frac{40}{(-0.02) \\times (1600)}\n$$\n$$\n\\phi_{\\min} = -\\frac{40}{-32}\n$$\n$$\n\\phi_{\\min} = \\frac{40}{32} = \\frac{5 \\times 8}{4 \\times 8} = \\frac{5}{4}\n$$\nThe result $\\phi_{\\min} = \\frac{5}{4}$ indicates that, for the given parameters, the energy cost of bending is so high relative to the energy gain from coat binding that even complete coverage ($\\phi=1$) is insufficient to make the process energetically neutral or favorable.

The total concentration is the sum of the concentrations of these species:\n$$[R]_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [RH^{+}] + [C]$$\nThe macroscopic fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of the total receptor population that is bound to the ligand.\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[C]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[C]}{[R] + [RH^{+}] + [C]}$$\nWe must express the concentrations $[R]$ and $[C]$ in terms of $[RH^{+}]$ and the given constants.\n\nFirst, consider the protonation equilibrium, governed by the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation for the acid dissociation $RH^{+} \\rightleftharpoons R + \\mathrm{H}^{+}$:\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{p}K_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[R]}{[RH^{+}]}\\right)$$\nRearranging this equation gives the ratio of deprotonated to protonated receptor:\n$$\\frac{[R]}{[RH^{+}]} = 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a}}$$\nThus, the concentration of the deprotonated receptor is:\n$$[R] = [RH^{+}] \\cdot 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a}}$$\n\nNext, consider the ligand binding equilibrium, $RH^{+} + L \\rightleftharpoons C$. The microscopic dissociation constant, $K_{d}^{H}$, is given by the law of mass action:\n$$K_{d}^{H} = \\frac{[RH^{+}][L]}{[C]}$$\nThe problem states that the deprotonated receptor does not bind, which is consistent with $K_{d}^{U} \\to \\infty$. Rearranging the binding equilibrium equation allows us to express the concentration of the complex, $[C]$, in terms of the free protonated receptor, $[RH^{+}]$:\n$$[C] = \\frac{[RH^{+}][L]}{K_{d}^{H}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $[R]$ and $[C]$ into the equation for the fractional occupancy $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta(\\mathrm{pH}) = \\frac{\\frac{[RH^{+}][L]}{K_{d}^{H}}}{([RH^{+}] \\cdot 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a}}) + [RH^{+}] + \\frac{[RH^{+}][L]}{K_{d}^{H}}}$$\nThe term $[RH^{+}]$ appears in the numerator and in every term of the denominator.

It removes the ER export signal and installs a potent PM internalization signal without creating unintended retrieval/retention motifs.\n\nFor the engineered protein from option A, the original D-A-E COPII-dependent ER export is abolished, which will slow its exit from the ER. Once it does reach the plasma membrane, the newly installed $YXX\\Phi$ motif will be recognized by the AP-2 complex, leading to rapid internalization.
