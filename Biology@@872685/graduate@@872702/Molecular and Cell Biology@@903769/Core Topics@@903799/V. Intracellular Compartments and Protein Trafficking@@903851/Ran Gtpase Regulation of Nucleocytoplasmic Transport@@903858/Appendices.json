The application of Michaelis–Menten kinetics to the RanGAP-catalyzed hydrolysis of RanGTP is a standard and appropriate model in quantitative cell biology. The provided parameters are within physically realistic ranges. We may therefore proceed directly to the solution.\n\n(a) Derivation and Computation of the Volumetric Hydrolysis Rate, $v$.\n\nThe foundational Michaelis–Menten scheme describes a single-substrate enzyme-catalyzed reaction as a two-step process. Let the enzyme be RanGAP, denoted as $E$, and the substrate be RanGTP, denoted as $S$. The enzyme and substrate reversibly form an enzyme-substrate complex, $ES$, which then irreversibly breaks down to release the product, $P$ (RanGDP and inorganic phosphate), and regenerate the free enzyme. The reaction scheme is:\n$$ E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\xrightarrow{k_2} E + P $$\nHere, $k_1$ is the rate constant for the association of $E$ and $S$, $k_{-1}$ is the rate constant for the dissociation of the $ES$ complex, and $k_2$ is the catalytic rate constant for the conversion of $ES$ to $E$ and $P$.\n\nThe rate of formation of the $ES$ complex is governed by the following differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_1 [E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\nThe problem states that we must use the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA). This approximation posits that after a brief initial transient, the concentration of the intermediate complex $[ES]$ remains approximately constant, meaning $\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} \\approx 0$. Applying this condition gives:\n$$ k_1 [E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\nThe total concentration of the enzyme, $[E]_{\\text{tot}}$, is the sum of the free enzyme concentration, $[E]$, and the concentration of the enzyme bound in the complex, $[ES]$:\n$$ [E]_{\\text{tot}} = [E] + [ES] $$\nFrom this mass balance equation, we express the free enzyme concentration as:\n$$ [E] = [E]_{\\text{tot}} - [ES] $$\nSubstituting this expression for $[E]$ into the steady-state equation yields:\n$$ k_1 ([E]_{\\text{tot}} - [ES])[S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\nWe now solve for $[ES]$. Expanding the left side gives:\n$$ k_1 [E]_{\\text{tot}}[S] - k_1 [ES][S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\nRearranging to group terms containing $[ES]$:\n$$ k_1 [E]_{\\text{tot}}[S] = (k_{-1} + k_2 + k_1[S])[ES] $$\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{k_1 [E]_{\\text{tot}}[S]}{k_{-1} + k_2 + k_1[S]} $$\nTo simplify this expression, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $k_1$:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{[E]_{\\text{tot}}[S]}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1} + [S]} $$\nThe Michaelis constant, $K_M$, is defined as the collection of rate constants $K_M \\equiv \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}$. Substituting this definition gives the steady-state concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{[E]_{\\text{tot}}[S]}{K_M + [S]} $$\nThe volumetric reaction rate, $v$, is the rate of product formation, which is given by:\n$$ v = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_2[ES] $$\nSubstituting the expression for $[ES]$:\n$$ v = k_2 \\frac{[E]_{\\text{tot}}[S]}{K_M + [S]} $$\nIn the single-substrate Michaelis–Menten model, the catalytic turnover number, $k_{\\text{cat}}$, is equivalent to the catalytic rate constant, $k_2$. The maximum reaction velocity, $V_{\\text{max}}$, is achieved when the enzyme is fully saturated with substrate ($[S] \\to \\infty$), which means $[ES] \\to [E]_{\\text{tot}}$, and thus $V_{\\text{max}} = k_2 [E]_{\\text{tot}} = k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_{\\text{tot}}$.\n\nReplacing $k_2$ with $k_{\\text{cat}}$, we arrive at the final expression for the Michaelis–Menten equation in terms of the specified parameters:\n$$ v = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_{\\text{tot}}[S]}{K_M + [S]} $$\nIn the context of this problem, $[E]_{\\text{tot}}$ is $[\\text{RanGAP}]_{\\text{tot}}$ and $[S]$ is $[\\text{RanGTP}]$. Therefore, the specific expression is:\n$$ v = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}[\\text{RanGAP}]_{\\text{tot}}[\\text{RanGTP}]}{K_M + [\\text{RanGTP}]} $$\nThis completes the derivation. Now, we compute the numerical value of $v$ using the provided data:\n- $[\\text{RanGAP}]_{\\text{tot}} = 0.20\\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n- $k_{\\text{cat}} = 30\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n- $K_M = 2\\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n- $[\\text{RanGTP}] = 5\\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$ v = \\frac{(30\\ \\text{s}^{-1})(0.20\\ \\mu\\text{M})(5\\ \\mu\\text{M})}{2\\ \\mu\\text{M} + 5\\ \\mu\\text{M}} $$\n$$ v = \\frac{30\\ \\mu\\text{M}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}}{7\\ \\mu\\text{M}} $$\n$$ v = \\frac{30}{7}\\ \\mu\\text{M} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ v \\approx 4.285714... \\ \\mu\\text{M} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, as requested:\n$$ v = 4.286\\ \\mu\\text{M} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1} $$\n\n(b) Interpretation of RanGAP Saturation and Gradient Robustness.\n\nThe Michaelis constant, $K_M$, represents the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is half of its maximum value, $V_{\\text{max}}$. In this case, $K_M = 2\\ \\mu\\text{M}$. The cytosolic substrate concentration is $[\\text{RanGTP}] = 5\\ \\mu\\text{M}$.\n\nSince $[\\text{RanGTP}] > K_M$ (specifically, $[\\text{RanGTP}] = 2.5 \\times K_M$), the enzyme RanGAP is operating at a rate significantly above half its maximal capacity. The degree of saturation can be quantified by the ratio of the current velocity $v$ to the maximal velocity $V_{\\text{max}}$. First, we calculate $V_{\\text{max}}$:\n$$ V_{\\text{max}} = k_{\\text{cat}}[\\text{RanGAP}]_{\\text{tot}} = (30\\ \\text{s}^{-1})(0.20\\ \\mu\\text{M}) = 6\\ \\mu\\text{M} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nThe fractional velocity is:\n$$ \\frac{v}{V_{\\text{max}}} = \\frac{4.286\\ \\mu\\text{M} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}}{6\\ \\mu\\text{M} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}} \\approx 0.714 $$\nAlternatively, from the Michaelis-Menten equation, this ratio is given by $\\frac{[\\text{RanGTP}]}{K_M + [\\text{RanGTP}]} = \\frac{5}{2+5} = \\frac{5}{7} \\approx 0.714$. With approximately $71\\%$ of its active sites occupied and turning over substrate, RanGAP is operating well into its saturation regime, though it is not completely saturated.\n\nThis near-saturating condition has a direct implication for the robustness of the RanGTP gradient. The RanGTP gradient is maintained by high RanGTP concentration in the nucleus and low concentration in the cytosol. RanGAP's function is to act as a cytosolic \"sink\" by rapidly hydrolyzing any RanGTP that exits the nucleus. When the enzyme operates near saturation, its rate of hydrolysis becomes less sensitive to increases in substrate concentration. The rate is approaching a plateau at $V_{\\text{max}}$.\n\nConsequently, if there is a transient surge in RanGTP efflux from the nucleus through the NPCs, the cytosolic RanGAP system will not be able to increase its hydrolysis rate proportionally. The rate will increase, but only from $71\\%$ of $V_{\\text{max}}$ towards $100\\%$. This provides a limited capacity to buffer the surge. A large, sudden influx of RanGTP could temporarily overwhelm the clearance capacity of RanGAP, leading to a transient increase in cytosolic RanGTP concentration and a partial, temporary collapse of the sharp nucleocytoplasmic gradient. The system is robust for steady-state maintenance but demonstrates diminished responsiveness to large, transient perturbations.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{4.286} $$", "id": "2961453"}, {"introduction": "The function of the Ran system is a masterclass in spatial regulation, where the *location* of enzymes is as important as their activity. Directionality in transport arises directly from the sequestration of the RanGEF (RCC1) in the nucleus and RanGAP in the cytoplasm. This conceptual challenge invites you to perform a thought experiment: what happens to transport if this fundamental spatial rule is broken by mislocalizing RCC1 to the cytoplasm? By deducing the consequences and then designing a 'rescue' by strategically retargeting RanGAP, you will develop a deeper intuition for the elegant logic that underpins nucleocytoplasmic transport [@problem_id:2961477].", "problem": "A laboratory re-engineers Regulator of Chromosome Condensation 1 (RCC1), the Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) for Ras-related Nuclear protein (Ran) GTPase, by adding a strong Nuclear Export Signal (NES), causing RCC1 to mislocalize predominantly to the cytoplasm. In wild type cells, RCC1 is chromatin-bound in the nucleus, while Ran GTPase-Activating Protein (RanGAP) is localized on the cytoplasmic face of the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC), typically via Ran-binding protein 2 (RanBP2/Nup358). This compartmentalization yields a high nuclear concentration of GTP-bound Ran, denoted $[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{nuc}$, and a low cytoplasmic concentration, $[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{cyto}$, which confers directionality on importin- and exportin-mediated transport.\n\nAssume the following foundational facts:\n- The Ran cycle couples nucleotide state to compartment: RCC1 catalyzes GDP-to-GTP exchange on Ran where RCC1 is located; RanGAP accelerates RanGTP hydrolysis where RanGAP resides.\n- Ran and accessory factors diffuse rapidly across the NPC, with RanGDP import favored by Nuclear Transport Factor 2 (NTF2), and RanGTP export occurring readily due to its interactions with importins/exportins. For the purposes of this problem, treat diffusion as sufficiently fast that steady-state spatial profiles are set primarily by the spatial separation of catalytic activities.\n- Importins bind cargo with classical Nuclear Localization Signals (NLSs) in the cytoplasm and release them upon RanGTP binding in the nucleus; exportins bind cargo with Nuclear Export Signals (NESs) cooperatively with RanGTP in the nucleus and release them upon RanGTP hydrolysis in the cytoplasm.\n\nDefine the dimensionless RanGTP gradient ratio as\n$$\nR \\equiv \\frac{[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{nuc}}{[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{cyto}} \\, .\n$$\nIn a coarse-grained steady-state description under fast diffusion, $R$ increases with the relative nuclear GEF activity and decreases with the relative nuclear GAP activity, and vice versa for the cytoplasm. Qualitatively, directionality for classical nuclear import and export requires $R \\gg 1$ to ensure importin cargo release in the nucleus and exportin cargo loading in the nucleus.\n\nUpon cytoplasmic mislocalization of RCC1, the lab observes loss of directionality: NLS cargo accumulates in neither compartment, and NES cargo fails to accumulate in the cytoplasm. You are asked to reason from the definitions above and the Ran cycle to explain why directionality collapses when RCC1 is shifted to the cytoplasm, and to propose a single engineered RanGAP targeting strategy that maximizes the magnitude of a steady-state RanGTP gradient and thereby restores predictable directionality (not necessarily the wild-type polarity).\n\nWhich option best captures both the mechanistic explanation and the most effective single-component rescue via engineered RanGAP targeting?\n\nA. Mislocalizing RCC1 to the cytoplasm raises $[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{cyto}$ and lowers $[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{nuc}$, driving $R \\to 0$, so importins release cargo prematurely in the cytoplasm and exportins cannot load cargo in the nucleus; targeting RanGAP to the nuclear face of the NPC (for example by fusing to a nuclear basket nucleoporin) will hydrolyze any nuclear RanGTP and, opposed by cytoplasmic RCC1, establish a steep inverted gradient with $R \\ll 1$, thereby restoring a robust but inverted directionality.\n\nB.

Mislocalizing RCC1 to the cytoplasm depletes nuclear RanGTP; depleting or delocalizing RanGAP away from the NPC will allow RCC1 activity to dominate globally and rebuild $R \\gg 1$ even without nuclear RCC1.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of nucleocytoplasmic transport regulated by the Ran GTPase system. The definitions and assumptions are self-contained, consistent, and well-posed, permitting a logical deduction of the system's behavior under the described perturbation and potential rescue scenarios.\n\nThe problem asks for a mechanistic explanation for the loss of transport directionality upon mislocalization of Regulator of Chromosome Condensation 1 (RCC1) to the cytoplasm, and to identify the most effective single-component rescue strategy involving engineered targeting of Ran GTPase-Activating Protein (RanGAP).\n\nFirst, we analyze the system based on the provided principles. The directionality of transport is dependent on the RanGTP gradient, quantified by the ratio $R \\equiv \\frac{[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{nuc}}{[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{cyto}}$. A steep gradient, where $R \\gg 1$ or $R \\ll 1$, is necessary for efficient and directional transport. This gradient is established by the spatial separation of the Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF), which is RCC1, and the GTPase-Activating Protein (GAP), which is RanGAP.\n\nIn the wild-type cell, RCC1 is localized to the nucleus, and RanGAP is localized to the cytoplasm.\n- The GEF activity of RCC1 in the nucleus catalyzes the reaction $\\text{RanGDP} \\to \\text{RanGTP}$. This generates a high concentration of RanGTP in the nucleus, $[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{nuc}$.\n- The GAP activity of RanGAP in the cytoplasm catalyzes the hydrolysis reaction $\\text{RanGTP} \\to \\text{RanGDP}$. This maintains a very low concentration of RanGTP in the cytoplasm, $[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{cyto}$.\n- The consequence is a large gradient, $R = \\frac{[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{nuc}}{[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{cyto}} \\gg 1$.\n- This gradient ensures directionality. Importins bind Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) cargo in the cytoplasm (low $[\\text{RanGTP}]$) and release it in the nucleus upon binding RanGTP (high $[\\text{RanGTP}]$). Exportins bind Nuclear Export Signal (NES) cargo cooperatively with RanGTP in the nucleus (high $[\\text{RanGTP}]$) and release it in the cytoplasm upon GTP hydrolysis (low $[\\text{RanGTP}]$).\n\nNow, consider the experimental perturbation: RCC1 is mislocalized to the cytoplasm, while RanGAP remains in the cytoplasm.\n- The source of RanGTP production (GEF activity) is moved from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This will dramatically lower $[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{nuc}$, as there is no longer a mechanism to convert the imported RanGDP into RanGTP within the nucleus.\n- In the cytoplasm, both the GEF (RCC1) and the GAP (RanGAP) are now active. While they oppose each other, the presence of RCC1 will inevitably lead to a higher steady-state concentration of $[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{cyto}$ than in the wild-type case, where it is near zero.\n- The net effect is that $[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{nuc}$ becomes very low, while $[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{cyto}$ increases. The ratio $R$ will therefore become very small, approaching $0$.\n- With $R \\ll 1$ (or even $R \\approx 1$, a collapsed gradient), directionality is lost. Importins cannot release their NLS cargo in the nucleus due to the low $[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{nuc}$. Exportins cannot form the trimeric complex (Exportin-NES cargo-RanGTP) in the nucleus, also due to the low $[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{nuc}$. This precisely explains the experimental observation of lost directionality.\n\nThe second part of the question asks for a rescue strategy by re-targeting RanGAP to restore a steep gradient. The GEF (RCC1) is now fixed in the cytoplasm. To re-establish a steep gradient, the opposing GAP activity must be localized to the other compartment, the nucleus.\n- Proposed rescue: Target RanGAP to the nucleus.\n- This creates a new spatial separation: GEF (RCC1) in the cytoplasm and GAP (RanGAP) in the nucleus.\n- This arrangement will generate a high concentration of RanGTP in the cytoplasm, $[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{cyto}$, and a low concentration in the nucleus, $[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{nuc}$, due to hydrolysis by the nuclear RanGAP.\n- This results in a steep, but inverted, gradient where $R \\ll 1$. Such a gradient, while having opposite polarity to wild-type, is nonetheless a large-magnitude gradient and will restore predictable, albeit inverted, directionality. For example, NES-bearing cargo would now be imported into the nucleus, and NLS-bearing cargo would be exported from it.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\nA. Mislocalizing RCC1 to the cytoplasm raises $[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{cyto}$ and lowers $[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{nuc}$, driving $R \\to 0$, so importins release cargo prematurely in the cytoplasm and exportins cannot load cargo in the nucleus; targeting RanGAP to the nuclear face of the NPC (for example by fusing to a nuclear basket nucleoporin) will hydrolyze any nuclear RanGTP and, opposed by cytoplasmic RCC1, establish a steep inverted gradient with $R \\ll 1$, thereby restoring a robust but inverted directionality.\n- The explanation of the problem is entirely correct, matching our derivation. The mislocalization of RCC1 causes $[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{nuc}$ to fall and $[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{cyto}$ to rise, collapsing the normal gradient ($R \\to 0$ or $R \\ll 1$). The consequences for importins and exportins are also correctly stated.\n- The proposed rescue strategy, targeting RanGAP to the nucleus (specifically, the nuclear face of the NPC), is the correct approach to re-establish spatial separation of GEF and GAP activities.\n- The outcome described, a steep inverted gradient ($R \\ll 1$) that restores inverted directionality, is also correct.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Mislocalizing RCC1 to the cytoplasm does not affect $R$ because Ran shuttles freely; leaving RanGAP in the cytoplasm will sequester Ran there and indirectly restore $R \\gg 1$ and wild-type directionality.\n- The premise \"does not affect $R$\" is fundamentally false. The problem explicitly states that the steady-state profile is set by the location of catalytic activities. Moving the location of the primary GEF must drastically alter the RanGTP distribution and thus $R$.\n- The proposed \"rescue\"—doing nothing—and the claim that this restores $R \\gg 1$ are illogical. With both GEF and GAP in the cytoplasm, there is no mechanism to selectively accumulate RanGTP in the nucleus.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Mislocalizing RCC1 to the cytoplasm transiently perturbs $R$, but targeting RanGAP uniformly to both nucleus and cytoplasm will buffer $[\\text{RanGTP}]$ to similar values in both compartments, stabilizing transport cycles and restoring directionality regardless of $R$.\n- Targeting RanGAP uniformly to both compartments would mean GAP activity is everywhere. With GEF activity only in the cytoplasm, nuclear RanGTP would be efficiently hydrolyzed, leading to a very low $[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{nuc}$. This contradicts the claim that concentrations would be \"similar\".\n- The most critical flaw is the statement \"restoring directionality regardless of $R$\". This violates a central principle given in the problem statement: directionality requires a steep gradient ($R \\gg 1$). If $R \\approx 1$, an equilibrium state exists where there is no net directional transport.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Mislocalizing RCC1 to the cytoplasm depletes nuclear RanGTP; depleting or delocalizing RanGAP away from the NPC will allow RCC1 activity to dominate globally and rebuild $R \\gg 1$ even without nuclear RCC1.\n- The proposed rescue is to eliminate or delocalize RanGAP. If RanGAP activity is removed globally, then the GEF (cytoplasmic RCC1) will be unopposed.\n- This would lead to the conversion of most of the cell's Ran pool to the GTP-bound state. Since Ran diffuses across the NPC, this would result in a high concentration of RanGTP everywhere, i.e., $[\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{nuc} \\approx [\\text{RanGTP}]_\\text{cyto}$.\n- The claim that this would \"rebuild $R \\gg 1$\" is false. This scenario leads to $R \\approx 1$, which abolishes the gradient and thus prevents directional transport.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nConclusion: Option A provides the only mechanistically sound explanation and effective rescue strategy consistent with the principles of the Ran system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2961477"}, {"introduction": "While qualitative models and single-component analysis provide crucial insights, a quantitative understanding requires integrating all key processes into a unified mathematical framework.

We can express $N_y, N_u$, and $N_v$ in terms of $N_x$:\nFrom $k_{\\text{exp}} N_x = k_{\\text{gef}} N_y \\implies N_y = \\frac{k_{\\text{exp}}}{k_{\\text{gef}}} N_x$\nFrom $k_{\\text{exp}} N_x = k_{\\text{gap}} N_u \\implies N_u = \\frac{k_{\\text{exp}}}{k_{\\text{gap}}} N_x$\nFrom $k_{\\text{exp}} N_x = k_{\\text{ntf2}} N_v \\implies N_v = \\frac{k_{\\text{exp}}}{k_{\\text{ntf2}}} N_x$\n\nSubstitute these expressions into the conservation equation:\n$$N_x + \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{exp}}}{k_{\\text{gef}}}\\right)N_x + \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{exp}}}{k_{\\text{gap}}}\\right)N_x + \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{exp}}}{k_{\\text{ntf2}}}\\right)N_x = R_{\\text{tot}}$$\n$$N_x \\left(1 + \\frac{k_{\\text{exp}}}{k_{\\text{gef}}} + \\frac{k_{\\text{exp}}}{k_{\\text{gap}}} + \\frac{k_{\\text{exp}}}{k_{\\text{ntf2}}}\\right) = R_{\\text{tot}}$$\nLet $S = 1 + \\frac{k_{\\text{exp}}}{k_{\\text{gef}}} + \\frac{k_{\\text{exp}}}{k_{\\text{gap}}} + \\frac{k_{\\text{exp}}}{k_{\\text{ntf2}}}$. Then $N_x = \\frac{R_{\\text{tot}}}{S}$.\n\nNow, substitute the given parameter values:\n$k_{\\text{gef}} = 1.0 \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\text{exp}} = 0.5 \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\text{gap}} = 1.0 \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\text{ntf2}} = 2.0 \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n$R_{\\text{tot}} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-17}$ mol\n$V_{n} = 0.5 \\text{ pL} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ L}$\n$V_{c} = 2.0 \\text{ pL} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ L}$\n\nCalculate the sum $S$:\n$$S = 1 + \\frac{0.5}{1.0} + \\frac{0.5}{1.0} + \\frac{0.5}{2.0} = 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.25$$\n\nNow we solve for the amounts of each species:\n$N_x = \\frac{R_{\\text{tot}}}{S} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{-17}}{2.25} \\text{ mol} = \\frac{10}{9} \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ mol}$\n$N_y = \\frac{k_{\\text{exp}}}{k_{\\text{gef}}} N_x = \\frac{0.5}{1.0} \\left(\\frac{10}{9} \\times 10^{-17}\\right) \\text{ mol} = \\frac{5}{9} \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ mol}$\n$N_u = \\frac{k_{\\text{exp}}}{k_{\\text{gap}}} N_x = \\frac{0.5}{1.0} \\left(\\frac{10}{9} \\times 10^{-17}\\right) \\text{ mol} = \\frac{5}{9} \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ mol}$\n$N_v = \\frac{k_{\\text{exp}}}{k_{\\text{ntf2}}} N_x = \\frac{0.5}{2.0} \\left(\\frac{10}{9} \\times 10^{-17}\\right) \\text{ mol} = \\frac{2.5}{9} \\times 10^{-17} = \\frac{5}{18} \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ mol}$\n\nFinally, we calculate the concentrations in units of micromolar ($\\mu$M, or $10^{-6}$ mol/L).\n$x = \\frac{N_x}{V_n} = \\frac{\\frac{10}{9} \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ mol}}{0.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ L}} = \\frac{20}{9} \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ M} = \\frac{20}{9} \\times 10^{-5} \\times 10^6 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M} \\approx 22.2222 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M}$\n$y = \\frac{N_y}{V_n} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{9} \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ mol}}{0.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ L}} = \\frac{10}{9} \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ M} = \\frac{10}{9} \\times 10^{-5} \\times 10^6 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M} \\approx 11.1111 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M}$\n$u = \\frac{N_u}{V_c} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{9} \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ mol}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ L}} = \\frac{5}{18} \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ M} = \\frac{5}{18} \\times 10^{-5} \\times 10^6 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M} \\approx 2.7777 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M}$\n$v = \\frac{N_v}{V_c} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{18} \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ mol}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ L}} = \\frac{5}{36} \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ M} = \\frac{5}{36} \\times 10^{-5} \\times 10^6 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M} \\approx 1.3888 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M}$\n\nRounding these values to four significant figures as required:\n$x = 22.22 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M}$\n$y = 11.11 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M}$\n$u = 2.778 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M}$\n$v = 1.389 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M}$\n\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix $[x \\;\\; y \\;\\; u \\;\\; v]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{bmatrix} 22.22 & 11.11 & 2.778 & 1.389 \\end{bmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2961429"}]}
