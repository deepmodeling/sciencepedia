This practice hones the critical skill of connecting a defined molecular perturbation to a complex cellular phenotype through logical deduction.", "problem": "A cell migrates on a fibronectin-coated, two-dimensional ($2\\text{D}$) elastic substrate under constant extracellular matrix (ECM) density and myosin II activity. Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that localizes to integrin-based adhesions, where it undergoes autophosphorylation on tyrosine $397$ to produce a high-affinity docking site for the Src Homology $2$ (SH2) domain of the sarcoma proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (Src). The FAK–Src complex phosphorylates multiple adhesion proteins, such as paxillin and Crk-associated substrate p130Cas (p130Cas), and promotes spatial activation of Rac$1$ while suppressing RhoA via p$190$RhoGAP to control lamellipodial protrusion, traction, and focal adhesion assembly–disassembly dynamics. Consider a mutant FAK in which tyrosine $397$ is replaced by phenylalanine (Y$397$F), eliminating autophosphorylation at this site and thereby preventing Src SH2 engagement. Assume integrin levels, ligand density, actin polymerization rates, and myosin II contractility are unchanged, and that the only engineered perturbation is the FAK Y$397$F substitution.\n\nUsing the following general principles as your base: (i) focal adhesion assembly and disassembly can be modeled as a balance of assembly and disassembly rate constants, with disassembly rate $k_{\\mathrm{dis}}$ defining the mean adhesion lifetime $\\tau$ via $\\tau = 1/k_{\\mathrm{dis}}$; (ii) efficient cell translocation on strongly adhesive $2\\text{D}$ substrates requires a balance wherein adhesions at the leading edge assemble and disassemble on time scales commensurate with protrusion and retraction, and overly stabilized adhesions slow translocation; (iii) FAK–Src signaling promotes phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of adhesion turnover machinery and Rac$1$-dependent protrusion while locally restraining RhoA-mediated adhesion stabilization.\n\nPredict the qualitative effect of the FAK Y$397$F mutation on cell migration speed $v$ and adhesion turnover (as reflected by $k_{\\mathrm{dis}}$ and $\\tau$) relative to wild type.\n\nChoose the best answer.\n\nA.

No substantial change in $v$ or adhesion turnover because talin–vinculin engagement fully compensates for loss of Src binding at FAK Y$397$.", "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific soundness, self-consistency, and clarity.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   **System**: A cell migrating on a fibronectin-coated, two-dimensional ($2\\text{D}$) elastic substrate.\n-   **Constants**: Extracellular matrix (ECM) density and myosin II activity are constant.\n-   **Wild-Type Pathway**: Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) autophosphorylates on tyrosine $397$ (Y$397$). This phosphosite serves as a docking site for the Src Homology $2$ (SH$2$) domain of the sarcoma proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (Src). The resulting FAK–Src complex phosphorylates downstream proteins (e.g., paxillin, p$130$Cas), promotes Rac$1$ activation, suppresses RhoA via p$190$RhoGAP, and regulates lamellipodial protrusion, traction, and focal adhesion dynamics.\n-   **Perturbation**: A mutant FAK where tyrosine $397$ is replaced by phenylalanine (Y$397$F), which prevents autophosphorylation and subsequent Src binding.\n-   **Assumptions**: Integrin levels, ligand density, actin polymerization rates, and myosin II contractility are unchanged. The FAK Y$397$F substitution is the sole perturbation.\n-   **Principle (i)**: The mean adhesion lifetime $\\tau$ is the inverse of the disassembly rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{dis}}$, i.e., $\\tau = 1/k_{\\mathrm{dis}}$.\n-   **Principle (ii)**: Efficient cell translocation requires a balance in adhesion dynamics. Overly stabilized adhesions impede cell migration.\n-   **Principle (iii)**: FAK–Src signaling is responsible for promoting the recruitment of adhesion turnover machinery, enhancing Rac$1$-dependent protrusion, and locally inhibiting RhoA-mediated adhesion stabilization.\n-   **Question**: Predict the qualitative effect of the FAK Y$397$F mutation on cell migration speed $v$ and adhesion turnover, as measured by $k_{\\mathrm{dis}}$ and $\\tau$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is evaluated as follows:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on well-established principles of molecular and cell biology concerning cell migration, focal adhesions, and the FAK-Src signaling axis. The roles of FAK, Src, Rho-family GTPases, and the consequences of the Y$397$F mutation are standard textbook and research knowledge. The principles provided are accurate summaries of complex biological processes. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed and Self-Contained**: The problem provides a clear initial state (wild type), a specific perturbation (FAK Y$397$F), a set of simplifying assumptions to isolate the variable of interest, and guiding principles to logically connect the molecular change to the cellular phenotype. It asks for a qualitative prediction, for which a unique logical answer exists. The problem is well-posed.\n-   **Objective**: The terminology is precise and standard for the field. The description of molecular events is factual and free from subjective bias. The problem is objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived based on the provided information and principles.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe objective is to deduce the consequences of abrogating FAK-Src complex formation by using the FAK Y$397$F mutant. The logical chain of events is as follows:\n\n1.  **Primary Molecular Defect**: The FAK Y$397$F mutation replaces a phosphorylatable tyrosine with a non-phosphorylatable phenylalanine. As stated, this prevents FAK autophosphorylation at this critical site.\n2.  **Loss of Src Recruitment**: The pY$397$ site on FAK is the high-affinity docking site for the Src SH$2$ domain. Without this phosphorylation event, Src cannot be recruited to FAK. The FAK–Src signaling complex, which is central to the downstream pathway, fails to form.\n3.  **Impact on Adhesion Turnover**: Principle (iii) explicitly states that the FAK–Src complex \"promotes recruitment of adhesion turnover machinery.\" This machinery is responsible for the disassembly of focal adhesions. Therefore, in the FAK Y$397$F mutant cells, the recruitment and/or activity of this disassembly machinery is impaired.\n4.  **Change in Kinetic Parameters**: A reduction in disassembly machinery function directly translates to a lower rate of focal adhesion disassembly. This means the disassembly rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{dis}}$, must decrease. According to Principle (i), the mean adhesion lifetime is $\\tau = 1/k_{\\mathrm{dis}}$. A decrease in $k_{\\mathrm{dis}}$ necessarily leads to an increase in $\\tau$. This implies that adhesions become longer-lived, larger, and more stable.\n5.  **Consequence for Rho-GTPase Signaling**: Principle (iii) also notes that FAK-Src signaling suppresses RhoA. The loss of FAK-Src signaling in the mutant cell would lead to a relief of this suppression, causing aberrantly high or spatially misregulated RhoA activity. Active RhoA is a potent promoter of focal adhesion stability and maturation (e.g., via its downstream effector ROCK). This effect reinforces the conclusion that adhesions become more stable. Concurrently, the loss of FAK-Src signaling impairs the promotion of Rac$1$ activity, which is needed for effective lamellipodial protrusion at the cell's leading edge.\n6.  **Effect on Cell Migration Speed**: Principle (ii) states that \"overly stabilized adhesions slow translocation.\" Our analysis in points $4$ and $5$ concludes that the FAK Y$397$F mutation leads to more stable adhesions (increased $\\tau$). These hyper-stable adhesions act as anchors that the cell cannot efficiently detach from, thus impeding the overall cycle of protrusion, adhesion, and retraction required for movement. The reduced Rac$1$ activity further compromises the protrusive engine of the cell. Both effects collaborate to reduce the cell's translocation capability. Therefore, the cell migration speed, $v$, must decrease.\n\n**Summary of Predictions**:\n-   Adhesion turnover: Slows.\n-   Disassembly rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{dis}}$: Decreases.\n-   Mean adhesion lifetime $\\tau$: Increases.\n-   Cell migration speed $v$: Decreases.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Cell migration speed $v$ decreases; adhesion turnover slows with decreased $k_{\\mathrm{dis}}$ and increased $\\tau$ (longer-lived, more stable adhesions).**\nThis statement posits that $v$ decreases, $k_{\\mathrm{dis}}$ decreases, and $\\tau$ increases. This aligns perfectly with the step-by-step derivation above. The loss of FAK-Src signaling cripples the adhesion disassembly process, leading to stabilized adhesions that in turn reduce cell motility.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Cell migration speed $v$ increases; adhesion turnover accelerates with increased $k_{\\mathrm{dis}}$ and decreased $\\tau$ (shorter-lived adhesions).**\nThis statement proposes the opposite outcome for all parameters. This would imply that FAK-Src signaling *inhibits* adhesion turnover, which contradicts Principle (iii) and established biological fact. It is therefore incorrect.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Cell migration speed $v$ decreases; adhesion turnover accelerates with increased $k_{\\mathrm{dis}}$ and decreased $\\tau$ because adhesions cannot mature without FAK–Src.**\nThis statement correctly predicts a decrease in $v$ but incorrectly describes the effect on adhesion turnover. The reason provided, that \"adhesions cannot mature,\" is a misinterpretation. While FAK-Src is involved in the dynamic life cycle of adhesions, its loss (coupled with the resulting increase in RhoA activity) leads to adhesion *hyper-stabilization* and maturation, not a failure to mature. The premises are contradictory.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. No substantial change in $v$ or adhesion turnover because talin–vinculin engagement fully compensates for loss of Src binding at FAK Y$397$.**\nThis statement suggests a complete compensatory mechanism. The talin-vinculin clutch is a core mechanical linkage, but it does not replicate the enzymatic and regulatory signaling functions of the FAK-Src complex. The problem is designed to probe the specific consequences of disrupting the FAK-Src pathway, as described in the principles. Assuming full compensation by an independent mechanism negates the premise of the question and is not a conclusion that can be drawn from the provided information.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2948779"}, {"introduction": "Focal adhesions are not just signaling hubs; they are sophisticated mechanotransducers that convert physical forces into biochemical signals.

You then assess, in parallel, the following readouts: traction force microscopy (cell-averaged traction stress), focal adhesion composition (immunofluorescence of vinculin and zyxin), talin conformational state using a Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) talin tension sensor, phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase at tyrosine $397$ (FAK pY397) and paxillin at tyrosine $118$ (paxillin pY118), actin retrograde flow rates at the leading edge by speckle microscopy, and Yes-Associated Protein (YAP)/Transcriptional co-Activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio.\n\nStarting from fundamental principles and well-tested observations, reason about the integrated effects of inhibiting actomyosin contractility on force transmission and mechanotransduction. The following principles are available as your base: (i) adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis by myosin II generates contractile tension in actin networks that is transmitted to the extracellular matrix (ECM) through integrin-based linkages; (ii) focal adhesion growth and maturation are tension-dependent, in that force stretches talin, exposing vinculin-binding sites and stabilizing adhesions; (iii) certain integrin–ligand bonds exhibit catch-bond behavior in which bond lifetime increases with intermediate force and decreases when force is too low or too high; (iv) phosphorylation of FAK pY397 and paxillin pY118 and nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ are enhanced by cytoskeletal tension and force transmission; (v) reduced coupling between the actin cytoskeleton and the ECM increases actin retrograde flow due to unopposed actin polymerization.\n\nWhich of the following integrated sets of observations is most consistent with the expected consequences of blebbistatin treatment in this system?\n\nA. Cell-averaged traction stress decreases substantially; vinculin and zyxin intensities in adhesions decrease; talin FRET efficiency increases (consistent with reduced talin stretch); FAK pY397 and paxillin pY118 levels decrease; actin retrograde flow increases; YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio decreases; nascent adhesions fail to mature and overall adhesion area shrinks.\n\nB. Cell-averaged traction stress decreases, but vinculin and zyxin intensities increase due to compensatory recruitment; talin FRET efficiency decreases; FAK pY397 and paxillin pY118 increase due to negative feedback release; actin retrograde flow decreases; YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio increases.\n\nC. On stiff substrates, cell-averaged traction stress is unchanged; vinculin recruitment increases because adhesion growth is stiffness-limited rather than force-limited; talin FRET efficiency decreases; FAK pY397 is unchanged while paxillin pY118 increases; actin retrograde flow is unchanged; YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio remains high.\n\nD.

Cell-averaged traction stress decreases; vinculin intensity decreases but zyxin intensity increases as low tension preferentially recruits zyxin; talin FRET efficiency increases; FAK pY397 increases due to enhanced integrin clustering at low force; actin retrograde flow increases; YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio increases due to reduced cytoskeletal opposition to nuclear translocation.", "solution": "The problem statement requires a deduction of the integrated cellular response to acute inhibition of nonmuscle myosin II with blebbistatin, based on a set of provided fundamental principles of mechanobiology.\n\nFirst, a validation of the problem statement is necessary.\nThe givens are:\n1.  **System**: Fibroblasts cultured on fibronectin-coated polyacrylamide hydrogels of varying elastic moduli.\n2.  **Perturbation**: Acute inhibition of nonmuscle myosin II adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity with blebbistatin at a concentration of $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ for $30$ minutes.\n3.  **Readouts**: Cell-averaged traction stress, focal adhesion composition (vinculin, zyxin), talin conformational state (FRET sensor), phosphorylation of FAK (pY397) and paxillin (pY118), actin retrograde flow, and YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio.\n4.  **Principles**:\n    (i) Myosin II ATPase activity generates contractile tension transmitted to the ECM.\n    (ii) Focal adhesion growth and maturation are tension-dependent via talin stretching, which exposes vinculin-binding sites.\n    (iii) Integrin-ligand bonds can exhibit catch-bond behavior.\n    (iv) Phosphorylation of FAK pY397 and paxillin pY118, and nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ, are enhanced by cytoskeletal tension.\n    (v) Reduced cytoskeleton-ECM coupling increases actin retrograde flow.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it describes a standard and well-characterized experiment in cell mechanobiology. The principles provided are cornerstones of the field. The language is objective and precise. The problem is well-posed, asking for the most consistent set of outcomes derived from the given principles. It is self-contained and free of contradictions. The experimental parameters ($50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ blebbistatin, $30$ minutes) are within realistic and commonly used ranges for achieving potent inhibition. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution may be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds by systematically applying the provided principles to deduce the effects of the perturbation.\n\nThe core perturbation is the inhibition of nonmuscle myosin II ATPase activity.\n\n1.  **Effect on Force Generation**: According to principle (i), myosin II activity is the source of contractile tension. Inhibiting this activity with blebbistatin will directly and substantially reduce the generation of intracellular tension. Consequently, the force transmitted to the extracellular matrix (ECM) through focal adhesions will decrease. This leads to the first prediction: **cell-averaged traction stress will decrease substantially.**\n\n2.  **Effect on Focal Adhesions and Talin Tension**: Principle (ii) states that focal adhesion maturation is tension-dependent. Force stretches the focal adhesion protein talin, which acts as a mechanosensor. This stretching exposes cryptic binding sites for other proteins, such as vinculin, leading to adhesion reinforcement and growth.\n    - With reduced tension from myosin II inhibition, the force exerted on talin molecules will decrease. Talin will adopt a more compact, less stretched conformation.\n    - A FRET-based talin tension sensor measures the distance between two fluorophores (a donor and an acceptor) engineered into the talin molecule. Reduced stretch brings the fluorophores closer together, thereby **increasing the Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) efficiency**.\n    - The reduced stretch of talin means fewer vinculin-binding sites will be exposed. This will lead to a **decrease in vinculin recruitment** to focal adhesions. Zyxin is another tension-sensitive protein that is recruited to focal adhesions under force; its levels are also expected to **decrease**.\n    - The loss of these reinforcing proteins and the overall reduction in mechanical load will destabilize the adhesions, causing them to **fail to mature and shrink in size/area**. This effect is further supported by principle (iii), as the reduced force on integrin-ligand bonds would shift them out of the optimal force range for catch-bond behavior, decreasing their lifetime and weakening the adhesion.\n\n3.  **Effect on Mechanosensitive Signaling**: Principle (iv) directly links key signaling events to cytoskeletal tension.\n    - The phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at tyrosine 397 (pY397) and of paxillin at tyrosine 118 (pY118) are well-established markers of active, force-bearing adhesions. As tension is reduced, the activity of the kinases responsible for these phosphorylation events (such as Src-family kinases recruited to active adhesions) will decrease. Therefore, **levels of FAK pY397 and paxillin pY118 will decrease**.\n    - The nuclear localization of the transcriptional regulators YAP and TAZ is also controlled by mechanical cues. High cytoskeletal tension promotes their translocation into the nucleus. The relaxation of the cytoskeleton following blebbistatin treatment will lead to the sequestration of YAP/TAZ in the cytoplasm. Consequently, the **YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio will decrease**.\n\n4.  **Effect on Actin Dynamics**: Principle (v) describes the relationship between ECM coupling and actin retrograde flow. The actin cytoskeleton is coupled to the ECM via integrins and their associated focal adhesions, forming a molecular \"clutch\". This clutch opposes the rearward flow of the actin network, which is driven by actin polymerization at the cell's leading edge.\n    - As established in point $2$, blebbistatin treatment leads to the weakening and disassembly of focal adhesions. This results in a \"reduced coupling\" or disengagement of the molecular clutch.\n    - With the clutch disengaged, the \"brake\" on the actin network is released. The ongoing actin polymerization at the front will now drive a faster rearward movement of the actin meshwork. Therefore, the **rate of actin retrograde flow will increase**.\n\nIn summary, the expected integrated response to blebbistatin treatment is: a substantial decrease in traction stress, an increase in talin FRET efficiency, a decrease in vinculin and zyxin recruitment leading to adhesion shrinkage, a decrease in FAK and paxillin phosphorylation, a decrease in the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of YAP/TAZ, and an increase in actin retrograde flow.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option against this derived set of consequences.\n\n**A. Cell-averaged traction stress decreases substantially; vinculin and zyxin intensities in adhesions decrease; talin FRET efficiency increases (consistent with reduced talin stretch); FAK pY397 and paxillin pY118 levels decrease; actin retrograde flow increases; YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio decreases; nascent adhesions fail to mature and overall adhesion area shrinks.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with all the deductions made from the provided principles. Each stated observation is a direct and logical consequence of inhibiting myosin II-generated tension.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Cell-averaged traction stress decreases, but vinculin and zyxin intensities increase due to compensatory recruitment; talin FRET efficiency decreases; FAK pY397 and paxillin pY118 increase due to negative feedback release; actin retrograde flow decreases; YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio increases.**\nThis option contains multiple contradictions. Vinculin recruitment is tension-dependent (principle ii), so it should decrease, not increase. Talin FRET efficiency should increase with relaxation, not decrease. FAK/paxillin phosphorylation and YAP/TAZ nuclear localization are driven by tension (principle iv), so they should decrease, not increase. Actin retrograde flow increases with reduced coupling (principle v), it does not decrease. The justifications \"compensatory recruitment\" and \"negative feedback release\" are ad hoc and not supported by the givens.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. On stiff substrates, cell-averaged traction stress is unchanged; vinculin recruitment increases because adhesion growth is stiffness-limited rather than force-limited; talin FRET efficiency decreases; FAK pY397 is unchanged while paxillin pY118 increases; actin retrograde flow is unchanged; YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio remains high.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. Blebbistatin inhibits the motor (myosin II), so traction stress *must* decrease regardless of substrate stiffness, contradicting principle (i). All subsequent claims, which are predicated on unchanged or increased tension, are therefore incorrect. Force is a prerequisite for tension-dependent processes, even on stiff substrates.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Cell-averaged traction stress decreases modestly; vinculin intensity is unchanged but zyxin increases as a repair response; talin FRET efficiency is unchanged because talin stretch is force-insensitive; FAK pY397 decreases while paxillin pY118 is unchanged; actin retrograde flow is unchanged; YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio is unchanged because nuclear import depends only on substrate stiffness.**\nThis option makes several factually incorrect statements that violate the principles. Talin is a canonical force sensor, so stating its stretch is \"force-insensitive\" contradicts principle (ii). Vinculin intensity must change as its binding sites are force-dependent. Actin retrograde flow must change due to altered coupling (principle v). YAP/TAZ localization is sensitive to tension, not just substrate stiffness (principle iv). The decrease in stress from $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ blebbistatin would be substantial, not modest.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Cell-averaged traction stress decreases; vinculin intensity decreases but zyxin intensity increases as low tension preferentially recruits zyxin; talin FRET efficiency increases; FAK pY397 increases due to enhanced integrin clustering at low force; actin retrograde flow increases; YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio increases due to reduced cytoskeletal opposition to nuclear translocation.**\nThis option contains a mixture of correct and incorrect statements with faulty reasoning. While it correctly states that traction stress decreases, vinculin decreases, talin FRET increases, and actin flow increases, it incorrectly claims that zyxin increases, FAK pY397 increases, and the YAP/TAZ ratio increases. The justification for zyxin increase is incorrect (zyxin is a tension sensor). The justification for FAK pY397 increase is speculative and contradicts principle (iv). The justification for the YAP/TAZ ratio increase misinterprets the mechanism; cytoskeletal tension is required for nuclear import, so its reduction decreases the ratio.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis of the given principles, Option A is the only one that presents a complete and correct set of consequences for the inhibition of actomyosin contractility.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2948826"}, {"introduction": "The concept of cellular force is central to mechanobiology, but how is it actually measured?

No derivation of $G_{0}$ is required.\n- The Tikhonov-regularized least-squares criterion is an appropriate well-tested approach for stabilizing the inversion of ill-conditioned compliance operators, yielding a unique solution for $t$.\n\nTest suite:\nFor each test case $j$, you are given:\n- Young’s modulus $E_{j}$ (in Pascals).\n- Pixel size $s_{j}$ (in micrometers per pixel).\n- Regularization parameter $\\lambda_{j}$ (in meters per Pascal).\n- A Green’s matrix $G_{0}^{(j)}$ evaluated at $E_{0}=1$ Pascal, with units of meters per Pascal, of shape $(2M_{j}) \\times (2N_{j})$ mapping $2N_{j}$ traction components to $2M_{j}$ displacement components.\n- A measured displacement vector $u_{\\text{px}}^{(j)}$ (in pixels) of length $2M_{j}$.\n\nFor each test case, compute the list of traction magnitudes per node in Pascals, rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n\nProvide results for the following $4$ test cases:\n\n- Test case $1$:\n  - $E_{1} = 1000.0$ (Pascals), $s_{1} = 0.1$ (micrometers per pixel), $\\lambda_{1} = 1.0\\times 10^{-10}$ (meters per Pascal).\n  - $G_{0}^{(1)} = 10^{-6} \\times \\begin{bmatrix}\n  1.00 & 0.20 & 0.05 & -0.03 \\\\\n  -0.10 & 0.80 & 0.02 & 0.04 \\\\\n  0.30 & -0.05 & 0.90 & 0.10 \\\\\n  0.00 & 0.25 & -0.15 & 0.70 \\\\\n  -0.20 & 0.10 & 0.05 & 0.60 \\\\\n  0.05 & -0.10 & 0.00 & 0.50\n  \\end{bmatrix}$, which is of shape $6 \\times 4$.\n  - $u_{\\text{px}}^{(1)} = \\begin{bmatrix} 5.0 & -2.0 & 3.0 & 1.0 & -4.0 & 2.5 \\end{bmatrix}^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\n\n- Test case $2$:\n  - $E_{2} = 1000.0$ (Pascals), $s_{2} = 0.1$ (micrometers per pixel), $\\lambda_{2} = 1.0\\times 10^{-10}$ (meters per Pascal).\n  - $G_{0}^{(2)} = G_{0}^{(1)}$ (same matrix as in test case $1$).\n  - $u_{\\text{px}}^{(2)} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\end{bmatrix}^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\n\n- Test case $3$ (ill-conditioned mapping, tests stabilization by regularization):\n  - $E_{3} = 2000.0$ (Pascals), $s_{3} = 0.065$ (micrometers per pixel), $\\lambda_{3} = 5.0\\times 10^{-10}$ (meters per Pascal).\n  - $G_{0}^{(3)} = 10^{-6} \\times \\begin{bmatrix}\n  1.00 & 0.00 & 1.00 & 0.00 \\\\\n  0.00 & 1.00 & 0.00 & 1.00 \\\\\n  0.99 & 0.01 & 1.01 & -0.01 \\\\\n  0.00 & 1.00 & 0.00 & 1.00 \\\\\n  1.00 & 0.00 & 1.00 & 0.00 \\\\\n  0.99 & 0.01 & 1.01 & -0.01\n  \\end{bmatrix}$, which is of shape $6 \\times 4$.\n  - $u_{\\text{px}}^{(3)} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.2 & -0.1 & 0.0 & 0.1 & -0.2 & 0.05 \\end{bmatrix}^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\n\n- Test case $4$ (overdetermined, $M > N$):\n  - $E_{4} = 1500.0$ (Pascals), $s_{4} = 0.08$ (micrometers per pixel), $\\lambda_{4} = 2.0\\times 10^{-10}$ (meters per Pascal).\n  - $G_{0}^{(4)} = 10^{-6} \\times \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0.90 & 0.10 & 0.20 & -0.10 \\\\\n  0.00 & 0.80 & -0.20 & 0.30 \\\\\n  0.30 & -0.20 & 0.85 & 0.05 \\\\\n  -0.10 & 0.25 & -0.15 & 0.70 \\\\\n  -0.20 & 0.05 & 0.10 & 0.60 \\\\\n  0.05 & -0.10 & 0.00 & 0.50 \\\\\n  0.40 & 0.00 & 0.20 & -0.05 \\\\\n  0.00 & 0.35 & -0.10 & 0.45\n  \\end{bmatrix}$, which is of shape $8 \\times 4$.\n  - $u_{\\text{px}}^{(4)} = \\begin{bmatrix} 8.0 & -1.0 & 2.5 & 3.0 & -3.5 & 4.0 & 1.2 & -2.2 \\end{bmatrix}^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing a list of lists.

The givens are extracted and examined for scientific grounding, formal correctness, and consistency. The problem statement describes the inversion of a linear model for Traction Force Microscopy ($u = G(E)t$), which is a standard problem in the field of mechanobiology. The physical model, including the scaling of the compliance operator $G(E) = G_0/E$, is sound and based on the principles of linear elasticity theory for small deformations. The proposed numerical method, Tikhonov-regularized least squares, is the correct and standard approach for stabilizing this type of ill-posed inverse problem.\n\nThe provided parameters and data are physically plausible and dimensionally consistent. The objective function to be minimized,\n$$\n\\min_{t}\\; \\left\\| G(E)\\,t - u \\right\\|_{2}^{2} \\;+\\; \\lambda^{2}\\,\\left\\| t \\right\\|_{2}^{2},\n$$\nis dimensionally consistent. The first term, $\\left\\| G(E)\\,t - u \\right\\|_{2}^{2}$, has units of $(\\text{meters})^2$ because $G(E)$ has units of $\\text{m/Pa}$, $t$ has units of $\\text{Pa}$, and $u$ has units of $\\text{m}$. The second term, $\\lambda^{2}\\,\\left\\| t \\right\\|_{2}^{2}$, also has units of $(\\text{meters})^2$, given that $\\lambda$ has units of $\\text{m/Pa}$ and $t$ has units of $\\text{Pa}$. This consistency is crucial for a physically meaningful formulation.\n\nThe problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for computing a unique, stable solution for each test case. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a formal solution will be furnished.\n\nThe objective is to find the traction vector $t$ that minimizes the Tikhonov-regularized cost function:\n$$\nJ(t) = \\left\\| G(E)\\,t - u \\right\\|_{2}^{2} \\;+\\; \\lambda^{2}\\,\\left\\| t \\right\\|_{2}^{2}\n$$\nwhere the compliance operator is given by $G(E) = \\frac{1}{E}G_0$. This cost function $J(t)$ is a quadratic function of $t$, and its unique minimum is found by setting its gradient with respect to $t$ to zero. The resulting solution for $t$ must satisfy the normal equations:\n$$\n(G(E)^{\\mathsf{T}}G(E) + \\lambda^2 I) t = G(E)^{\\mathsf{T}}u\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the identity matrix of appropriate dimension. While this formulation provides an analytical expression for $t$ through matrix inversion, direct implementation can be numerically unstable, particularly if the matrix $G(E)^{\\mathsf{T}}G(E)$ is ill-conditioned. A more robust numerical method is to reformulate the problem as a standard linear least-squares problem. The minimization of $J(t)$ is mathematically equivalent to solving the following augmented system in a least-squares sense:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} G(E) \\\\ \\lambda I \\end{pmatrix} t = \\begin{pmatrix} u \\\\ \\mathbf{0} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWhere $I$ is the identity matrix of dimension $2N \\times 2N$ (if $t$ has $2N$ components) and $\\mathbf{0}$ is a zero vector of length $2N$. Let $A' = \\begin{pmatrix} G(E) \\\\ \\lambda I \\end{pmatrix}$ and $b' = \\begin{pmatrix} u \\\\ \\mathbf{0} \\end{pmatrix}$. We then solve for the vector $t$ that minimizes the Euclidean norm of the residual, $\\| A't - b' \\|_2$. This method avoids explicit matrix inversion and is implemented numerically for each test case.\n\nThe computational procedure is executed as follows:\n$1$. For each test case $j$, the inputs are Young’s modulus $E_j$, pixel size $s_j$, regularization parameter $\\lambda_j$, the base Green’s matrix $G_0^{(j)}$, and the measured displacement vector in pixels, $u_{\\text{px}}^{(j)}$.\n$2$. The displacement vector is converted from units of pixels to meters using the provided relation: $u^{(j)} = u_{\\text{px}}^{(j)} \\times s_j \\times 10^{-6}$.\n$3$. The compliance operator $G(E_j)$ is constructed from the base Green's matrix $G_0^{(j)}$ and Young's modulus $E_j$: $G(E_j) = G_0^{(j)} / E_j$.\n$4$. Let the dimensions of $G(E_j)$ be $2M_j \\times 2N_j$. The augmented system matrix $A'_j$ (of size $(2M_j+2N_j) \\times 2N_j$) and augmented vector $b'_j$ (of length $2M_j+2N_j$) are formed:\n$$\nA'_j = \\begin{pmatrix} G(E_j) \\\\ \\lambda_j I_{2N_j} \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad b'_j = \\begin{pmatrix} u^{(j)} \\\\ \\mathbf{0}_{2N_j} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$5$. The linear least-squares problem $A'_j t_j = b'_j$ is solved for the unknown traction vector $t_j$. This yields a vector of length $2N_j$.\n$6$. The resulting vector $t_j$, containing components $[t_{x,1}, t_{y,1}, t_{x,2}, t_{y,2}, \\dots, t_{x,N_j}, t_{y,N_j}]^{\\mathsf{T}}$, is partitioned into $N_j$ pairs $(t_{x,i}, t_{y,i})$, each corresponding to a traction node.\n$7$. The scalar magnitude of the traction force at each node $i$ is computed as $\\|t_i\\| = \\sqrt{t_{x,i}^2 + t_{y,i}^2}$.\n$8$. These magnitudes are collected into a list and rounded to $6$ decimal places, as specified.
