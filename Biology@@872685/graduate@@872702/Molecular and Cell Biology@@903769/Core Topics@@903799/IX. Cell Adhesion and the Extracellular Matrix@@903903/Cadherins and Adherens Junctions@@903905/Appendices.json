In this architecture, the N-terminal $\\beta$-strand (often called the A$^{*}$ strand) of one protomer complements the partner EC1 by inserting a conserved tryptophan at position $2$ (Trp$2$) into a hydrophobic pocket on the partner, while extracellular calcium ions ($\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$) bound between EC repeats rigidify the ectodomain. Consider a mutation that replaces Trp$2$ with alanine (W$2$A). Assume physiological $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ and ionic strength, and that cell-cell adhesive strength scales monotonically with the equilibrium fraction of cadherin engaged in trans strand-swap dimers at the contact.\n\nA mutational thermodynamic study reports that, relative to wild type, W$2$A raises the standard Gibbs free energy of strand-swap dimerization by approximately $+3.5\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$ at $T=298\\,\\mathrm{K}$. No other parts of the interface are altered. Ignore effects on expression and trafficking.\n\nWhich option best explains the structural role of Trp$2$ in EC1 and most accurately predicts the effect of the W$2$A mutation on adhesive strength?\n\nA. Trp$2$ functions as a hydrophobic anchor that inserts into a complementary pocket in the partner EC1 during strand-swap dimerization, stabilizing the swapped interface; replacing it with alanine removes deep hydrophobic packing, selectively destabilizes the strand-swap dimer relative to the transient encounter (X-) dimer, and thus lowers adhesive strength under physiological $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$.\n\nB.

We will proceed to derive the correct conclusion by evaluating the provided options against fundamental principles.\n\nThe central task is to understand the consequences of the W$2$A mutation on the dimerization of classical cadherins and the resulting cell-cell adhesion. The adhesion is mediated by the formation of a *trans* strand-swap dimer, where the N-terminal tryptophan at position $2$ (Trp$2$) of one cadherin molecule is inserted into a hydrophobic pocket of a partner molecule on an opposing cell.\n\nThe mutation replaces tryptophan (Trp), an amino acid with a large, hydrophobic indole side chain, with alanine (Ala), which has a small methyl group side chain. This substitution drastically reduces the size and hydrophobicity of the residue at position $2$. The problem states this mutation raises the standard Gibbs free energy of strand-swap dimerization ($\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{dimerization}}$) by $\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ} \\approx +3.5\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$ at $T=298\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nA positive change in the Gibbs free energy of dimerization signifies that the process has become less thermodynamically favorable. The equilibrium between monomeric ($M$) and dimeric ($D$) cadherin, $M+M \\rightleftharpoons D$, will shift to the left, favoring the monomeric state. The strength of this dimerization is quantified by the dissociation constant, $K_d$, which is related to the standard Gibbs free energy of dimerization by the equation:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{dimerization}} = -RT \\ln K_a = RT \\ln K_d $$\nwhere $K_a$ is the association constant, $K_d = 1/K_a$, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe change in the standard Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}$, relates the dissociation constants of the wild-type ($K_{d,WT}$) and mutant ($K_{d,W2A}$) systems as follows:\n$$ \\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ} = \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{W2A} - \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{WT} = RT \\ln K_{d,W2A} - RT \\ln K_{d,WT} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{d,W2A}}{K_{d,WT}}\\right) $$\nGiven $\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ} = +3.5\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$, $T=298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and $R \\approx 1.987 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, the value of $RT$ is approximately $0.592\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$. We can calculate the fold-change in the dissociation constant:\n$$ \\frac{K_{d,W2A}}{K_{d,WT}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}}{RT}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{+3.5\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}}{0.592\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}}\\right) \\approx \\exp(5.91) \\approx 369 $$\nThis means the W$2$A mutation increases the dissociation constant by a factor of approximately $370$, indicating a severe weakening of the dimerization affinity. As per the problem's assumption, adhesive strength scales with the fraction of engaged dimers. A much weaker affinity will lead to a significantly lower fraction of dimers at equilibrium, and therefore, a substantial reduction in adhesive strength.\n\nWith this foundation, we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. Trp$2$ functions as a hydrophobic anchor that inserts into a complementary pocket in the partner EC1 during strand-swap dimerization, stabilizing the swapped interface; replacing it with alanine removes deep hydrophobic packing, selectively destabilizes the strand-swap dimer relative to the transient encounter (X-) dimer, and thus lowers adhesive strength under physiological $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$.**\nThis statement is entirely consistent with our analysis. It correctly identifies the role of Trp$2$ as a \"hydrophobic anchor,\" a fitting description given the problem statement. Replacing Trp with Ala indeed removes critical hydrophobic packing interactions. This destabilizes the dimer, which is reflected in the positive $\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}$. A destabilized dimer leads to a lower population of *trans* dimers and, consequently, reduced adhesive strength. The mention of the transient X-dimer is contextually appropriate, as selectively destabilizing the final strand-swapped state shifts the equilibrium away from it.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Trp$2$ primarily coordinates extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ between EC repeats; substituting alanine disrupts $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ binding but leaves strand-swap packing intact, so adhesive strength is unchanged when $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ is abundant.**\nThis is factually incorrect. The problem describes Trp$2$ as part of the *trans* dimerization interface at the N-terminus. $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ ions bind in specific pockets formed between adjacent EC repeats (e.g., EC1-EC2, EC2-EC3), which are spatially distinct from the Trp$2$ location. These binding sites are typically composed of acidic residues like aspartate and glutamate, not tryptophan. The mutation would have a minimal, if any, direct effect on $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ binding, but a major effect on strand-swap packing. The conclusion is therefore based on a false premise.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. W$2$A reduces steric clashes at the strand-swap interface and thereby makes dimerization more enthalpically favorable; the dissociation constant decreases and cell-cell adhesion strengthens.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. In a well-evolved protein interface, a large residue like tryptophan fits into a complementary pocket and is not a source of \"steric clash.\" Its large size is crucial for favorable van der Waals contacts and the hydrophobic effect. Removing it creates a void and weakens binding. The claim that dimerization becomes more favorable is directly contradicted by the given data ($\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}=+3.5\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$), which indicates that dimerization is *less* favorable. Consequently, the dissociation constant *increases* (weaker binding), and adhesion *weakens*. Every assertion in this option is wrong.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. If W$2$A raises the standard free energy of strand-swap dimerization by $\\approx +3.5\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$ at $T=298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, the equilibrium dissociation constant increases by only about $\\sim 10$-fold; therefore, the mutation produces at most a minor reduction in adhesive strength.**\nThis option contains a significant quantitative error. As calculated above, a $\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}$ of $+3.5\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$ corresponds to a $\\sim 370$-fold increase in $K_d$, not a $\\sim 10$-fold increase. A $10$-fold increase in $K_d$ would require a $\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}$ of only $RT \\ln(10) \\approx 1.36\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$. Furthermore, a $\\sim 370$-fold reduction in the affinity of the fundamental adhesive bond cannot be considered a \"minor\" effect; it represents a drastic impairment of the interaction and would lead to a major loss of adhesion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. In the absence of $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$, W$2$A will restore adhesion by promoting a $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$-independent *cis*-clustering of cadherins that compensates for the loss of strand-swap trans interactions.**\nThis option is speculative and contradicts established knowledge. It introduces a condition (\"absence of $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$\") not specified in the problem setup, which is under physiological $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$. In the absence of $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$, the cadherin ectodomain loses its rigid, rod-like structure and becomes flexible, which ablates its canonical adhesive function. The idea that the W$2$A mutation, located at the *trans* interface, would promote a compensatory *cis*-clustering mechanism that works in the absence of $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ is unsubstantiated and biologically implausible.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2936400"}, {"introduction": "Adherens junctions are not static; they are dynamic structures that must withstand mechanical forces generated by the cell's own actomyosin cytoskeleton and by neighboring cells.

The solution process may now proceed.\n\nThe force-dependent dissociation rate, $k_{\\mathrm{off}}(F)$, is given to be proportional to $\\exp(-\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(F)/(k_B T))$, where $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(F)$ is the force-dependent activation energy barrier.

The model's validity must be rigorously assessed before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extracted Givens**\n\n- **System Geometry:** A planar system of two polygonal cells defined by two fixed anchor vertices, $L=(-1,0)$ and $R=(1,0)$, and two mobile vertices, $v_1$ and $v_2$.\n- **Initial Conditions:** The mobile vertices are initially at $v_1(0)=(0,-0.2)$ and $v_2(0)=(0,0.2)$.\n- **Cell Definitions:**\n  - Left cell: A counterclockwise polygon $[L, v_1, v_2]$.\n  - Right cell: A counterclockwise polygon $[R, v_2, v_1]$.\n- **Total Mechanical Energy:** The system energy $E$ is given by\n  $$E = \\sum_{e \\in \\mathcal{E}} \\Lambda_e \\, L_e \\;+\\; \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{C}} \\frac{K}{2}\\,\\big(A_i - A_i^{(0)}\\big)^2$$\n  where $\\Lambda_e$ is the line tension of edge $e$ with length $L_e$, and $A_i$ is the area of cell $i$ with target area $A_i^{(0)}$ and area elasticity modulus $K$.\n- **Parameters:**\n  - Line tensions: $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{central}}$ for the central edge $(v_1, v_2)$ and $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{other}}$ for the four lateral edges $(v_1,L), (v_2,L), (v_1,R), (v_2,R)$.\n  - Target areas $A_i^{(0)}$ are the initial areas of the cells.\n- **Minimization Procedure:** Gradient descent with backtracking line search on the coordinates of $v_1$ and $v_2$.\n  - **Gradient of Tension:** For an edge between vertices $\\mathbf{x}_i$ and $\\mathbf{x}_j$, the gradient contribution at $\\mathbf{x}_i$ is $-\\Lambda_e\\,(\\mathbf{x}_j-\\mathbf{x}_i)/L_e$.\n  - **Gradient of Area:** For a cell with CCW vertices $[\\mathbf{x}_0,\\dots,\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}]$, the gradient of area $A$ with respect to vertex $\\mathbf{x}_k$ is $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}_k} A = \\frac{1}{2}\\,(y_{k+1}-y_{k-1},\\,x_{k-1}-x_{k+1})$.

The energy functional, comprising line tension and area elasticity terms, is a standard representation.

The model, although simplified, is based on established biophysical principles.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. The energy function is continuous and differentiable (except at zero-length edges, which are handled by the mechanics of the simulation), ensuring that gradient-based minimization is applicable. All necessary parameters, initial conditions, and termination criteria are specified, defining a unique computational task.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise mathematical and algorithmic language, free of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem formulation does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed computational problem.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be developed and implemented as specified.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Algorithm\n\nThe task is to find the equilibrium configuration of the two-cell system by minimizing the total energy $E$ with respect to the coordinates of the mobile vertices $v_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $v_2 = (x_2, y_2)$. The state of the system can be represented by a vector $\\mathbf{X} = [x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2]^T$.\n\n**1. Initial State and Target Areas**\n\nThe fixed vertices are $L=(-1,0)$ and $R=(1,0)$. The initial positions of the mobile vertices are $v_1(0)=(0,-0.2)$ and $v_2(0)=(0,0.2)$. The target areas $A_i^{(0)}$ are calculated from these initial positions using the Shoelace formula for polygonal area, $A = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (x_k y_{k+1} - x_{k+1} y_k)$ for counterclockwise vertices.\n\n- **Left cell** vertices: $[L, v_1(0), v_2(0)] = [(-1,0), (0,-0.2), (0,0.2)]$.\n  $$A_{\\mathrm{left}}^{(0)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| (-1)(-0.2) - (0)(0) + (0)(0.2) - (-0.2)(0) + (0)(0) - (0.2)(-1) \\right| = 0.2$$\n- **Right cell** vertices: $[R, v_2(0), v_1(0)] = [(1,0), (0,0.2), (0,-0.2)]$.\n  $$A_{\\mathrm{right}}^{(0)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| (1)(0.2) - (0)(0) + (0)(-0.2) - (0.2)(0) + (0)(0) - (-0.2)(1) \\right| = 0.2$$\nDue to symmetry, $A_{\\mathrm{left}}^{(0)} = A_{\\mathrm{right}}^{(0)} = 0.2$.\n\n**2. Energy and Gradient Calculation**\n\nThe total gradient $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{X}} E$ is the sum of gradients from the tension and area terms.\n\n- **Tension Term:** The potential energy of an edge with tension $\\Lambda_e$ between vertices $\\mathbf{x}_i$ and $\\mathbf{x}_j$ is $E_e = \\Lambda_e \\|\\mathbf{x}_j - \\mathbf{x}_i\\|$. The gradient with respect to $\\mathbf{x}_i$ is $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}_i} E_e = \\Lambda_e \\frac{\\mathbf{x}_i - \\mathbf{x}_j}{\\|\\mathbf{x}_j - \\mathbf{x}_i\\|}$. This matches the provided formula. The total tension gradient is the sum over all edges connected to a mobile vertex.\n\n- **Area Term:** The potential energy for a cell $i$ is $E_{A_i} = \\frac{K}{2}(A_i - A_i^{(0)})^2$. The gradient with respect to a vertex $\\mathbf{x}_k$ is $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}_k} E_{A_i} = K(A_i - A_i^{(0)}) \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}_k} A_i$.\n  The gradient of the area itself, $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}_k} A_i$, is given by the specified formula $\\frac{1}{2}(y_{k+1}-y_{k-1}, x_{k-1}-x_{k+1})$. We apply this to both cells for each mobile vertex.\n\n  - **For the left cell** $[L, v_1, v_2]$ ($p_0=L, p_1=v_1, p_2=v_2$):\n    - $\\nabla_{v_1} A_{\\mathrm{left}} = \\frac{1}{2}(y_2 - y_L, x_L - x_2) = \\frac{1}{2}(y_2, -1 - x_2)$\n    - $\\nabla_{v_2} A_{\\mathrm{left}} = \\frac{1}{2}(y_L - y_1, x_1 - x_L) = \\frac{1}{2}(-y_1, x_1 + 1)$\n  - **For the right cell** $[R, v_2, v_1]$ ($q_0=R, q_1=v_2, q_2=v_1$):\n    - $\\nabla_{v_1} A_{\\mathrm{right}} = \\frac{1}{2}(y_R - y_2, x_2 - x_R) = \\frac{1}{2}(-y_2, x_2 - 1)$\n    - $\\nabla_{v_2} A_{\\mathrm{right}} = \\frac{1}{2}(y_1 - y_R, x_R - x_1) = \\frac{1}{2}(y_1, 1 - x_1)$\n\nThe total gradient $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{X}} E$ is a $4$-dimensional vector composed of the gradient contributions to $v_1=(x_1, y_1)$ and $v_2=(x_2, y_2)$.\n\n**3. Minimization Algorithm: Gradient Descent with Backtracking Line Search**\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1. Initialize $\\mathbf{X}^{(0)} = [0, -0.2, 0, 0.2]$.\n2. For iteration $k=0, 1, \\dots, N_{\\max}-1$:\n   a. Calculate the current energy $E^{(k)}$ and gradient $\\mathbf{g}^{(k)} = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{X}} E(\\mathbf{X}^{(k)})$.\n   b. Check for convergence: if $\\|\\mathbf{g}^{(k)}\\| < 10^{-8}$, terminate.\n   c. **Backtracking Line Search:**\n      i. Initialize step size $\\alpha = \\alpha_0 = 0.1$.\n      ii. While $E(\\mathbf{X}^{(k)} - \\alpha \\mathbf{g}^{(k)}) > E^{(k)} - c \\alpha \\|\\mathbf{g}^{(k)}\\|^2$:\n         - Reduce step size: $\\alpha \\leftarrow \\rho \\alpha$, where $\\rho=0.5$.\n      iii. Accept the step size $\\alpha$.\n   d. Update the state: $\\mathbf{X}^{(k+1)} = \\mathbf{X}^{(k)} - \\alpha \\mathbf{g}^{(k)}$.\n3. After termination, calculate the final length of the central interface, $L_{\\mathrm{central}}^{\\ast} = \\|\\mathbf{v}_2^{\\ast} - \\mathbf{v}_1^{\\ast}\\|$.\n4. The prediction is `True` if $L_{\\mathrm{central}}^{\\ast} \\le 10^{-3}$, and `False` otherwise.
