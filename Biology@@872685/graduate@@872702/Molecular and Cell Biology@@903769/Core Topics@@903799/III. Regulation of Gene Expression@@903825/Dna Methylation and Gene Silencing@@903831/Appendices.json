Mastering this simple but critical conversion is the first step toward interpreting methylomes and linking them to gene regulation.", "problem": "A promoter region in a differentiated somatic cell is annotated as a CpG island and contains $120$ cytosine–phosphate–guanine (CpG) sites. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) library preparation relies on sodium bisulfite chemistry, which converts unmethylated cytosines to uracils (read as thymines after polymerase chain reaction), while 5-methylcytosines remain as cytosines. Consequently, reads that report cytosine at a CpG position are counted as methylated, and reads that report thymine at that position are counted as unmethylated. Assume complete conversion of unmethylated cytosines, negligible non-conversion, and no mapping bias; also assume that aggregating reads across all CpG sites in the promoter yields an unbiased region-level estimate.\n\nYou are given aggregated counts across the promoter: $9600$ methylated reads and $2400$ unmethylated reads.

Reads with T at a CpG site are counted as 'unmethylated'.\n- Assumptions: Complete conversion, negligible non-conversion, no mapping bias, and aggregated reads provide an unbiased region-level estimate.\n- Aggregated data:\n    - Methylated reads count: $9600$.\n    - Unmethylated reads count: $2400$.\n- Required task:\n    1. Derive an expression for the promoter methylation level (beta value, $\\beta$).\n    2. Compute the value of $\\beta$ for the given data, rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n    3. Conclude if this $\\beta$ value is consistent with active gene silencing.\n\n**Step 2: Validation**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, describing the fundamental principles of sodium bisulfite sequencing correctly. It is well-posed, providing all necessary numerical data and clear definitions to compute a unique value. The assumptions, while idealizations, are standard for simplifying such problems and do not render it invalid. The language is objective and precise. The number of CpG sites, $120$, provides biological context but is not required for the calculation based on a region-level aggregation of read counts, which is a standard approach in bioinformatics. This does not represent a contradiction. The problem is free of the listed flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe promoter methylation level, or beta value, is defined as the fraction of methylated cytosines at a given set of CpG sites. In the context of sequencing data, this is estimated from the read counts.\n\nLet $M$ be the count of methylated reads and $U$ be the count of unmethylated reads for the promoter region. According to the problem statement, a read is counted as methylated if a cytosine (C) is observed at a CpG position, and as unmethylated if a thymine (T) is observed.\n\nThe given data are:\n- Methylated read count, $M = 9600$.\n- Unmethylated read count, $U = 2400$.\n\nThe total number of reads that provide information about the methylation status of the CpG sites in the promoter is the sum of the methylated and unmethylated reads. Let this total be $N_{total}$.\n$$N_{total} = M + U$$\nThe beta value, $\\beta$, is the ratio of the methylated read count to the total read count. This represents the proportion of sequencing reads that indicate methylation. The expression is therefore:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{M}{M + U}$$\nSubstituting the provided numerical values into this expression:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{9600}{9600 + 2400}$$\nFirst, we compute the sum in the denominator:\n$$9600 + 2400 = 12000$$\nNow we can compute the value of $\\beta$:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{9600}{12000} = \\frac{96}{120}$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. Both are divisible by $24$:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{96 \\div 24}{120 \\div 24} = \\frac{4}{5}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$\\beta = 0.8$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. To express $0.8$ with four significant figures, we write it as $0.8000$.\n\nFinally, we must assess whether this methylation level is consistent with active gene silencing. In developmental biology and epigenetics, it is a well-established principle that CpG islands associated with gene promoters are typically unmethylated in most somatic cells, which correlates with an open chromatin state and transcriptional permissiveness. Conversely, hypermethylation of a CpG island promoter, defined as a high density of methylated cytosines, is a canonical epigenetic mark for stable, long-term gene silencing. A beta value approaching $1$ indicates hypermethylation, while a value approaching $0$ indicates hypomethylation. A $\\beta$ value of $0.8000$ signifies that $80\\%$ of the DNA molecules in the sequenced cell population are methylated at this promoter. This high level of methylation is firmly in the hypermethylated range and is strongly indicative of a transcriptionally repressed state. Therefore, this methylation level is entirely consistent with active gene silencing of the associated gene in this differentiated somatic cell lineage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8000}$$", "id": "2631264"}, {"introduction": "A methylation value gains its biological significance from its genomic context.

It is based on standard concepts in molecular biology such as CpG islands, GC content, and DNA methylation patterns in cancer. The provided data are self-contained, consistent, and plausible. The task is to perform a series of calculations based on these established definitions to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution. Thus, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution process consists of two main steps: first, determining if the promoter region qualifies as a CpG island, and second, calculating the change in methylation based on this classification.\n\nStep 1: Classification of the promoter region as a CpG island. We must verify all three criteria.\n\nCriterion 1: Length.\nThe length of the region is given as $N = 1000$ base pairs. The criterion is length $\\ge 500$ base pairs. Since $1000 \\ge 500$, this criterion is satisfied.\n\nCriterion 2: Guanine-Cytosine (GC) content.\nThe GC content is the fraction of guanine and cytosine bases in the sequence. It is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{GC content} = \\frac{n_G + n_C}{N} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\text{GC content} = \\frac{260 + 260}{1000} = \\frac{520}{1000} = 0.52 $$\nThe criterion is GC content $\\ge 0.5$. Since $0.52 \\ge 0.5$, this criterion is also satisfied.\n\nCriterion 3: Observed-to-expected CpG ratio.\nThe observed number of CpG dinucleotides is given as $n_{\\mathrm{CpG}}^{\\mathrm{obs}} = 50$. We must calculate the expected number of CpG dinucleotides, $n_{\\mathrm{CpG}}^{\\mathrm{exp}}$, under the assumption of first-order independence. The probability of observing a cytosine at any position is $P(C) = \\frac{n_C}{N}$, and the probability of observing a guanine is $P(G) = \\frac{n_G}{N}$. Under independence, the probability of a CpG dinucleotide is $P(\\mathrm{CpG}) = P(C) \\times P(G)$. In a sequence of length $N$, there are $N-1$ possible dinucleotide positions. Therefore, the expected number of CpG dinucleotides is:\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{CpG}}^{\\mathrm{exp}} = (N-1) \\times P(C) \\times P(G) = (N-1) \\frac{n_C}{N} \\frac{n_G}{N} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{CpG}}^{\\mathrm{exp}} = (1000-1) \\times \\frac{260}{1000} \\times \\frac{260}{1000} = 999 \\times 0.26 \\times 0.26 = 999 \\times 0.0676 = 67.5324 $$\nThe observed-to-expected CpG ratio is then:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{CpG}}^{\\mathrm{obs}}}{n_{\\mathrm{CpG}}^{\\mathrm{exp}}} = \\frac{50}{67.5324} \\approx 0.74038 $$\nThe criterion is a ratio $\\ge 0.6$. Since $0.74038 \\ge 0.6$, this third criterion is satisfied.\n\nSince all three criteria (length, GC content, and observed-to-expected CpG ratio) are met, the promoter region is classified as a CpG island (CGI).\n\nStep 2: Calculation of the change in methylation fraction, $\\Delta m$.\nThe calculation depends on the classification from Step 1. As the region is a CGI, we use the rules specified for CGI promoters.\n\nThe average methylation fraction in normal somatic cells for a CGI promoter is:\n$$ m_{\\mathrm{somatic}} = m_{\\mathrm{CGI},S} = 0.1 $$\nIn cancer cells, a fraction $p = 0.3$ of such promoters become hypermethylated to a level of $m_H = 0.8$, while the remaining fraction, $1-p = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$, maintains the normal somatic methylation level, $m_{\\mathrm{CGI},S} = 0.1$. The expected methylation fraction in cancer cells, $m_{\\mathrm{cancer}}$, is the weighted average:\n$$ m_{\\mathrm{cancer}} = p \\times m_H + (1-p) \\times m_{\\mathrm{CGI},S} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ m_{\\mathrm{cancer}} = (0.3 \\times 0.8) + (0.7 \\times 0.1) = 0.24 + 0.07 = 0.31 $$\nThe expected change in methylation fraction, $\\Delta m$, is the difference between the cancer and somatic methylation levels:\n$$ \\Delta m = m_{\\mathrm{cancer}} - m_{\\mathrm{somatic}} $$\n$$ \\Delta m = 0.31 - 0.1 = 0.21 $$\nThis is an exact value. The final result is the change in methylation fraction for this promoter.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.21}$$", "id": "2941928"}, {"introduction": "Before generating any data, a researcher must make a critical strategic decision: which experimental method is best suited for the scientific question at hand? This problem requires you to act as an experimental designer, comparing the strengths and weaknesses of three major DNA methylation profiling technologies [@problem_id:2941935]. By reasoning from first principles, you will learn to evaluate the trade-offs between resolution, genomic coverage, and cost to make an informed methodological choice.", "problem": "A laboratory is designing a study to link cytosine DNA methylation to transcriptional gene silencing across multiple human cell types. They must choose among Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS), and Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (MeDIP-seq). Use only the following foundational facts to reason to an answer: (i) sodium bisulfite deaminates unmethylated cytosines to uracils while 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is protected, so post-conversion sequencing reports methylation at single-nucleotide resolution; (ii) restriction enzyme enrichment and size selection constrain which genomic regions are represented in a library; (iii) antibody-based enrichment captures fragments based on epitope density, not single bases; (iv) the sequencing depth required scales with the fraction of the genome interrogated; and (v) in promoter-proximal CpG-rich regions, methylation often correlates with stable gene silencing.\n\nWhich option most accurately compares the three methods in resolution, coverage bias, and cost, and proposes appropriate use cases and controls for gene silencing studies?\n\nA. WGBS provides single-base resolution across essentially the entire mappable genome at the highest cost because it requires deep sequencing of all converted DNA; it is appropriate for comprehensive methylome profiling, including intergenic and non-CpG contexts, and for defining differentially methylated regions associated with silencing. Appropriate controls include an unmethylated spike-in (for example, lambda DNA) to estimate non-conversion, optional fully methylated spike-ins to monitor over-conversion, and orthogonal validation at sentinel loci. RRBS also provides single-base resolution but is biased toward CpG-dense regions due to restriction digestion and size selection; it is appropriate for promoter/enhancer-focused silencing questions at lower cost, with the same bisulfite conversion spike-in controls and monitoring of fragment size distribution to ensure consistent enrichment. MeDIP-seq yields regional enrichment signals proportional to 5mC density rather than single-base calls, is biased toward CpG- and methylation-dense regions, and is lower cost per sample; it is appropriate for discovering large differentially methylated regions and heterochromatic domains linked to silencing. Appropriate controls include input DNA controls for normalization, immunoglobulin G (IgG) negative controls, and synthetic methylated/unmethylated spike-ins to calibrate recovery and assess specificity, with attention to potential cross-reactivity with 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC).\n\nB. WGBS provides regional (not single-base) resolution but is the least expensive approach because it avoids enrichment steps; it is best suited only to promoters. RRBS is unbiased across the genome and is optimal for low-CpG intergenic regions because it uses the methylation-sensitive enzyme HpaII to exclude methylated sites; appropriate controls for RRBS are IgG negative controls. MeDIP-seq provides single-base resolution when fragments are short and is therefore ideal for precise promoter CpG mapping; appropriate controls for MeDIP-seq are bisulfite conversion spike-ins.\n\nC. WGBS provides single-base resolution but suffers a strong bias toward CpG islands because bisulfite conversion preferentially retains CpG-rich DNA; it is therefore mainly used for promoter methylation at modest cost, with IgG negative controls being the primary control. RRBS has regional resolution because restriction fragments span many CpGs; it is preferred for intergenic methylation and non-CpG methylation, with no specific conversion controls needed if coverage is deep. MeDIP-seq has single-base resolution like WGBS and is unbiased across CpG density if sonication yields fragments of about $100$–$200$ base pairs; appropriate controls are only input DNA controls.\n\nD. WGBS provides single-base resolution and is high cost; it is appropriate for comprehensive methylome analysis, but bisulfite conversion controls are unnecessary if duplicate reads are removed. RRBS provides single-base resolution and is unbiased across CpG density because it uses MspI, and is therefore suited to detect methylation changes in low-CpG deserts at low cost, with IgG controls. MeDIP-seq yields regional signals and is cheapest; it is optimal for detecting non-CpG methylation at single-base precision, with unmethylated lambda spike-ins as the main control.", "solution": "The problem statement must first be validated for its scientific and logical integrity.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\nThe provided data and principles are as follows:\n-   **Technologies**: Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS), and Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (MeDIP-seq).\n-   **Objective**: To compare these methods for a study linking cytosine DNA methylation to transcriptional gene silencing.\n-   **Foundational Fact (i)**: Sodium bisulfite deaminates unmethylated cytosines to uracils, while 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is protected.

Fact (i) describes single-base resolution from bisulfite treatment. Fact (ii) describes the basis of RRBS bias. Fact (iii) describes the regional resolution of affinity-based methods like MeDIP-seq. Fact (iv) is a fundamental principle of sequencing cost. Fact (v) provides the biological rationale for the proposed study.

It provides a set of axioms (the five facts) and asks for a logical deduction based on them to compare three methods. A unique best answer is expected.\n-   **Objectivity**: The language is objective and technical. The problem does not contain subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated question requiring the application of first principles to evaluate complex experimental methodologies. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n**Principle-Based Derivation**\n\nI will now analyze each technology based on the provided foundational facts.\n\n1.  **Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS)**:\n    -   **Resolution**: This method involves bisulfite conversion of the entire genome. According to fact (i), this provides **single-nucleotide resolution**.\n    -   **Coverage**: By definition, it aims to cover the \"whole genome.\" Thus, it is the most comprehensive and, in principle, the least biased method in terms of genomic features covered.\n    -   **Cost**: According to fact (iv), because it interrogates the largest fraction of the genome (nearly $100\\%$), it requires the greatest sequencing depth and is therefore the **highest cost** method.\n    -   **Use Case**: Its comprehensive, high-resolution nature makes it the gold standard for discovering novel differentially methylated regions (DMRs) anywhere in the genome, including intergenic regions, and for studying non-CpG methylation. It is ideal for comprehensive methylome profiling.\n    -   **Controls**: As a bisulfite-based technique, a key control is to assess the chemical conversion efficiency. An unmethylated DNA spike-in (e.g., lambda phage DNA) is used to measure the non-conversion rate of unmethylated cytosines, which is a critical quality metric.\n\n2.  **Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS)**:\n    -   **Resolution**: This method also uses bisulfite conversion. Therefore, per fact (i), it provides **single-nucleotide resolution** within the genomic regions it captures.\n    -   **Coverage**: According to fact (ii), the use of restriction enzymes (e.g., MspI, which cuts at CpG-containing sites) and subsequent size selection means the library is enriched for a specific subset of the genome. This introduces a significant **bias toward CpG-dense regions**, such as CpG islands and promoters.\n    -   **Cost**: RRBS interrogates only a small fraction of the genome. Following fact (iv), this dramatically reduces the required sequencing depth and thus the **cost** compared to WGBS.\n    -   **Use Case**: Given its enrichment for CpG-rich promoters and enhancers, and fact (v) linking promoter methylation to silencing, RRBS is a cost-effective method for studies focused on gene regulatory regions.\n    -   **Controls**: Like WGBS, it requires bisulfite conversion controls (e.g., unmethylated spike-in). Additionally, monitoring the library's fragment size distribution is a necessary quality control to ensure the restriction digest and size selection were effective and consistent.\n\n3.  **Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (MeDIP-seq)**:\n    -   **Resolution**: Fact (iii) explicitly states that antibody-based methods capture fragments based on epitope density. This means the signal is an average over the length of a DNA fragment, not a precise measurement at a single base. Therefore, the resolution is **regional**, not single-base.\n    -   **Coverage**: The method uses an antibody to enrich for methylated DNA. Consequently, its coverage is inherently **biased toward regions of high methylation density**.\n    -   **Cost**: As an enrichment method, it sequences only a fraction of the genome, making it **lower cost** than WGBS, per fact (iv).\n    -   **Use Case**: Due to its regional resolution and bias, it is well-suited for identifying large-scale changes in methylation, such as large DMRs or alterations in heterochromatic domains, providing a genome-wide survey of methylation hotspots.\n    -   **Controls**: As an immunoprecipitation (IP) technique, it requires specific controls: an `input` control (pre-IP DNA) for normalization; a non-specific antibody (e.g., IgG) control to assess background; and methylated/unmethylated spike-in DNA to calibrate antibody enrichment efficiency. A potential issue with anti-5mC antibodies is cross-reactivity with other modifications like 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which must be considered.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **Option A**: This option aligns perfectly with the analysis derived above.\n    -   It correctly states WGBS has single-base resolution, is comprehensive, and is high-cost, with appropriate use cases and bisulfite conversion spike-in controls.\n    -   It correctly identifies RRBS as having single-base resolution but being biased to CpG-rich regions, making it a lower-cost alternative for promoter-focused studies, requiring both conversion controls and fragment size monitoring.\n    -   It correctly describes MeDIP-seq as having regional resolution, being biased to methylated regions, being lower-cost, and appropriate for discovering large DMRs. It also correctly lists the standard controls for an IP-based experiment, including input, IgG, and spike-ins, and notes the potential for 5hmC cross-reactivity.\n    -   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **Option B**: This option is fundamentally flawed.\n    -   It incorrectly claims WGBS has regional resolution and is the least expensive.\n    -   It incorrectly claims RRBS is unbiased and optimal for low-CpG regions. It incorrectly suggests IgG controls for RRBS.\n    -   It incorrectly claims MeDIP-seq has single-base resolution and incorrectly suggests bisulfite controls for it.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **Option C**: This option contains multiple errors.\n    -   It incorrectly claims WGBS is biased toward CpG islands due to bisulfite conversion and suggests IgG controls.\n    -   It incorrectly claims RRBS has regional resolution and is preferred for intergenic regions. It wrongly states conversion controls are not needed.\n    -   It incorrectly claims MeDIP-seq has single-base resolution and is unbiased. It suggests incomplete controls.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **Option D**: This option contains critical errors.\n    -   It incorrectly states that bisulfite conversion controls for WGBS are unnecessary. This is a severe methodological flaw.\n    -   It incorrectly claims RRBS is unbiased and suited for low-CpG regions. It wrongly suggests IgG controls.\n    -   It incorrectly claims MeDIP-seq is optimal for non-CpG methylation at single-base precision and suggests lambda spike-ins (a bisulfite control) as the main control.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on a rigorous application of the provided foundational facts, only Option A provides an accurate and complete comparison of the three methods.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2941935"}]}
