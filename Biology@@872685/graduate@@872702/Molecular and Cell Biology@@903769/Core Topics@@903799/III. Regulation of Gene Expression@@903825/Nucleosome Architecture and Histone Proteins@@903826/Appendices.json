According to the problem's assumptions, these are random variables.\n\nThe fractions of inherited parental marks are defined as:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{lead}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{lead}}}{n} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f_{\\mathrm{lag}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{lag}}}{n}\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the total number of parental histone tetramers.\n\nFrom assumption (i), each of the $n$ tetramers is transferred to exactly one of the two nascent chromatids. Therefore, the sum of the numbers of tetramers on the two strands must be the total number of tetramers:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{lead}} + N_{\\mathrm{lag}} = n\n$$\nUsing this relation, we express the fractional asymmetry, $f_{\\mathrm{lead}} - f_{\\mathrm{lag}}$, in terms of a single random variable, $N_{\\mathrm{lead}}$:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{lead}} - f_{\\mathrm{lag}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{lead}}}{n} - \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{lag}}}{n} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{lead}} - (n - N_{\\mathrm{lead}})}{n} = \\frac{2N_{\\mathrm{lead}} - n}{n}\n$$\nThe quantity to be derived is $A(p,n) \\equiv \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\left(f_{\\mathrm{lead}} - f_{\\mathrm{lag}}\\right)^{2}\\right]$. Substituting the expression above:\n$$\nA(p,n) = \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\left(\\frac{2N_{\\mathrm{lead}} - n}{n}\\right)^{2}\\right] = \\frac{1}{n^{2}} \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\left(2N_{\\mathrm{lead}} - n\\right)^{2}\\right]\n$$\nThe core of the problem reduces to calculating the expectation of the squared term. The distribution of $N_{\\mathrm{lead}}$ must be determined. Based on assumptions (ii) and (iii), the deposition of each of the $n$ parental tetramers is an independent Bernoulli trial. The probability of \"success\" (deposition on the leading-strand chromatid) for each trial is $p$. The total number of successes, $N_{\\mathrm{lead}}$, therefore follows a binomial distribution:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{lead}} \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n, p)\n$$\nThe fundamental properties of a random variable $X \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n, p)$ are its mean (expected value) and variance:\n$$\n\\mu = \\mathbb{E}[X] = np\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\mathbb{E}[(X - \\mu)^{2}] = np(1-p)\n$$\nWe need to evaluate $\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\left(2N_{\\mathrm{lead}} - n\\right)^{2}\\right]$. Let $X = N_{\\mathrm{lead}}$. We can rewrite the term inside the expectation by centering it around the mean $\\mu = np$:\n$$\n2X - n = 2(X - np) + 2np - n = 2(X - \\mu) - n(1 - 2p)\n$$\nNow, we compute the expectation of the square of this expression:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[(2X - n)^{2}] = \\mathbb{E}\\! \\left[ \\left( 2(X - \\mu) - n(1 - 2p) \\right)^{2} \\right]\n$$\nExpanding the binomial square:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[(2X - n)^{2}] = \\mathbb{E}\\! \\left[ 4(X - \\mu)^{2} - 4n(1 - 2p)(X - \\mu) + n^{2}(1 - 2p)^{2} \\right]\n$$\nBy linearity of expectation, we can separate the terms:\n$$\n= 4\\mathbb{E}[(X - \\mu)^{2}] - 4n(1 - 2p)\\mathbb{E}[X - \\mu] + \\mathbb{E}[n^{2}(1 - 2p)^{2}]\n$$\nWe evaluate each term:\n1.  $\\mathbb{E}[(X - \\mu)^{2}]$ is the definition of the variance of $X$, so $\\mathbb{E}[(X - \\mu)^{2}] = \\mathrm{Var}(X) = np(1-p)$.\n2.  $\\mathbb{E}[X - \\mu] = \\mathbb{E}[X] - \\mu = \\mu - \\mu = 0$.\n3.  $n^{2}(1 - 2p)^{2}$ is a constant, so its expectation is the constant itself.\n\nSubstituting these results back into the equation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[(2N_{\\mathrm{lead}} - n)^{2}] = 4(np(1-p)) - 4n(1-2p)(0) + n^{2}(1 - 2p)^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[(2N_{\\mathrm{lead}} - n)^{2}] = 4np(1-p) + n^{2}(1 - 2p)^{2}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this result into the expression for $A(p,n)$:\n$$\nA(p,n) = \\frac{1}{n^{2}} \\left[ 4np(1-p) + n^{2}(1 - 2p)^{2} \\right]\n$$\nSimplifying the expression by distributing the $1/n^2$ factor yields the final closed-form analytic expression:\n$$\nA(p,n) = \\frac{4p(1-p)}{n} + (1-2p)^{2}\n$$\nThis expression represents the expected squared fractional asymmetry of parental mark inheritance between sister chromatids as a function of the total number of nucleosomes, $n$, and the partitioning probability, $p$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{4p(1-p)}{n} + (1-2p)^{2}}\n$$", "id": "2958290"}]}
