Start from the foundational framework of the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and the mechanistic steps of bacterial translation, which couples macromolecular assembly and conformational changes to nucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis. Assume the following empirically established features of bacterial protein synthesis:\n\n- Each aminoacylation of a transfer RNA (tRNA) by an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase consumes one adenosine triphosphate (ATP), hydrolyzed to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate (PPi). Count the initiator methionyl-tRNA among these events. For energetic accounting, treat ATP hydrolyzed to AMP as consuming $2$ high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds.\n- Translation initiation on a bacterial messenger RNA (mRNA) consumes $1$ guanosine triphosphate (GTP) by Initiation Factor $2$ (IF-$2$).\n- Each elongation cycle that adds one amino acid to the nascent chain after initiation requires $2$ GTP: one by Elongation Factor Tu (EF-Tu) to deliver the aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site and one by Elongation Factor G (EF-G) to catalyze translocation.\n- Termination and ribosome recycling together consume $2$ additional GTP: one by Release Factor $3$ (RF$3$) to promote release factor turnover and one by EF-G acting with Ribosome Recycling Factor (RRF) to split the post-termination complex.\n\nLet the final polypeptide length be $n$ amino acids.

Count each ATP hydrolyzed to AMP as $2$ equivalents and each GTP hydrolyzed to GDP as $1$ equivalent. Report your final result as a dimensionless count of high-energy phosphoanhydride bond equivalents. No rounding is required. Provide the final answer as a single analytic expression in terms of $n$.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It provides a set of clear, established premises from molecular biology concerning the stoichiometry of ATP and GTP consumption during bacterial protein synthesis. The task is to derive a total energetic cost function based solely on these premises, which constitutes a valid and formalizable problem. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe total energetic cost, denoted as $E_{total}$, for the synthesis of a single polypeptide of length $n$ amino acids can be expressed as the sum of the costs of four distinct and sequential stages: amino acid activation (aminoacylation), translation initiation, polypeptide chain elongation, and translation termination.\n\n$$E_{total} = E_{acyl} + E_{init} + E_{elong} + E_{term}$$\n\nWe will now derive the energetic cost for each stage from the principles and stoichiometric values provided in the problem statement. The cost is measured in equivalents of high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds.\n\n1.  **Cost of Aminoacylation ($E_{acyl}$)**:\n    A polypeptide of length $n$ is a polymer of $n$ amino acids. Before incorporation into the polypeptide chain, each of these $n$ amino acids must be \"activated\" by being covalently attached to its corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule. This reaction is catalyzed by an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. The problem states that each such event, including the formation of the initiator methionyl-tRNA, consumes one molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is hydrolyzed to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate (PPi). The hydrolysis ATP $\\rightarrow$ AMP + PPi involves the cleavage of two high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds. Therefore, it is accounted as $2$ energy equivalents.\n    For a polypeptide of length $n$, there are $n$ such aminoacylation events. The total cost for this stage is:\n    $$E_{acyl} = n \\times (\\text{cost per aminoacylation})$$\n    $$E_{acyl} = n \\times 2$$\n    $$E_{acyl} = 2n$$\n\n2.  **Cost of Initiation ($E_{init}$)**:\n    The synthesis of each polypeptide chain begins with the assembly of the translation initiation complex on the messenger RNA (mRNA). According to the problem, this process consumes one molecule of guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is hydrolyzed to guanosine diphosphate (GDP). The hydrolysis GTP $\\rightarrow$ GDP + Pi involves the cleavage of one high-energy phosphoanhydride bond, which is counted as $1$ energy equivalent. Initiation is a singular event for each polypeptide synthesized.\n    Thus, the cost of initiation is:\n    $$E_{init} = 1$$\n\n3.  **Cost of Elongation ($E_{elong}$)**:\n    Following initiation, the polypeptide chain is extended by the sequential addition of amino acids. The first amino acid is positioned in the ribosomal P-site during initiation. The remaining $n-1$ amino acids are added during $n-1$ successive cycles of elongation. The problem specifies that each elongation cycle consumes two molecules of GTP. One GTP is used by Elongation Factor Tu (EF-Tu) for the delivery of an aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A-site, and a second GTP is used by Elongation Factor G (EF-G) to catalyze the translocation of the ribosome along the mRNA. Each GTP hydrolysis yields $1$ energy equivalent.\n    The total cost for the $n-1$ elongation cycles is:\n    $$E_{elong} = (n-1) \\times (\\text{cost per cycle})$$\n    $$E_{elong} = (n-1) \\times (1_{\\text{EF-Tu}} + 1_{\\text{EF-G}})$$\n    $$E_{elong} = (n-1) \\times 2$$\n    $$E_{elong} = 2n - 2$$\n\n4.  **Cost of Termination ($E_{term}$)**:\n    When the ribosome reaches a stop codon on the mRNA, the process of translation terminates, and the completed polypeptide is released. The problem states that termination and subsequent ribosome recycling together consume two additional molecules of GTP. These are attributed to RF$3$ and EF-G/RRF activities. This is a singular event marking the end of synthesis for one polypeptide. The hydrolysis of two GTP molecules corresponds to $2$ energy equivalents.\n    Therefore, the cost of termination is:\n    $$E_{term} = 2$$\n\nFinally, to find the total energetic cost, $E_{total}$, we sum the costs of all four stages:\n$$E_{total} = E_{acyl} + E_{init} + E_{elong} + E_{term}$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for each term:\n$$E_{total} = (2n) + (1) + (2n - 2) + (2)$$\nCombining the terms with $n$ and the constant terms:\n$$E_{total} = (2n + 2n) + (1 - 2 + 2)$$\n$$E_{total} = 4n + 1$$\n\nThis closed-form expression represents the total number of high-energy phosphoanhydride bond equivalents required to synthesize a polypeptide of length $n$ in a bacterium, based on the provided stoichiometry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4n + 1}$$", "id": "2967275"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its energetic cost, the accuracy of translation is paramount to cellular function, as even a single incorrect amino acid can lead to a nonfunctional protein.

The stages are as follows.\n\nFrom the initially bound pre-hydrolysis complex $C_{0,X}$, there are two competing, first-order exits: guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis (irreversible activation) at rate $k_{h}^{X}$ to the post-hydrolysis complex $C_{1,X}$, and dissociation (rejection) to the free ribosome at rate $k_{\\mathrm{off},0}^{X}$. From the activated post-hydrolysis complex $C_{1,X}$, there are again two competing exits: peptidyl transfer (irreversible product formation) at rate $k_{\\mathrm{pep}}^{X}$, and proofreading rejection (release) at rate $k_{\\mathrm{pr}}^{X}$.

Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system describes a two-stage selection process for a transfer RNA (tRNA) of class $X$, where $X$ can be cognate ($c$) or near-cognate ($n$). The process starts from an initial complex $C_{0,X}$ and may proceed to a product through an intermediate complex $C_{1,X}$. The transitions are governed by first-order kinetics, which implies that the waiting times for each step are exponentially distributed and the process is memoryless. This allows us to calculate the probability of a particular pathway by considering the branching ratios at each step.\n\nFirst, consider the initial discrimination stage starting from the pre-hydrolysis complex $C_{0,X}$. This complex has two possible fates: irreversible activation via GTP hydrolysis to form $C_{1,X}$ at a rate of $k_{h}^{X}$, or dissociation (rejection) at a rate of $k_{\\mathrm{off},0}^{X}$. The total rate of exit from state $C_{0,X}$ is the sum of these rates, $k_{h}^{X} + k_{\\mathrm{off},0}^{X}$. The probability, $P_{h|X}$, that a complex in state $C_{0,X}$ will proceed to the activated state $C_{1,X}$ is the ratio of the activation rate to the total exit rate:\n$$P_{h|X} = \\frac{k_{h}^{X}}{k_{h}^{X} + k_{\\mathrm{off},0}^{X}}$$\n\nNext, consider the proofreading stage starting from the post-hydrolysis complex $C_{1,X}$. This complex also has two possible fates: irreversible product formation via peptidyl transfer at a rate of $k_{\\mathrm{pep}}^{X}$, or proofreading rejection at a rate of $k_{\\mathrm{pr}}^{X}$. The total rate of exit from state $C_{1,X}$ is $k_{\\mathrm{pep}}^{X} + k_{\\mathrm{pr}}^{X}$.

You overexpress the cognate transfer RNA (tRNA) that uniquely decodes codon $r$ by a factor $n$ (with $n \\gg 1$), without changing any other components. Assume the following fundamental bases:\n- The Central Dogma and the standard model of translation, in which the ribosome moves codon-by-codon and elongation at a codon requires binding of the correctly charged tRNA.\n- At the level of a single codon type $j$, the instantaneous elongation step frequency increases monotonically with the concentration of its correctly charged tRNA, consistent with mass-action binding of tRNA to the ribosomal A-site.\n- The pool of free ribosomal subunits $R_{\\mathrm{free}}$ is determined by ribosome conservation, $R_{\\mathrm{tot}} = R_{\\mathrm{free}} + \\sum_m R_m$, where $R_m$ is the mean number of ribosomes engaged on mRNA $m$; decreasing ribosome dwell time on messages increases $R_{\\mathrm{free}}$, thereby increasing initiation rates on messages that are initiation-limited.\n- The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase for the amino acid specified by codon $r$ (for concreteness, arginyl–tRNA synthetase), here denoted ArgRS, has finite catalytic capacity $V_{\\max}$ and charges all arginine tRNA isoacceptors that compete for the same amino acid and enzyme active sites.\n\nAt baseline, many class $H$ mRNAs exhibit elongation limitation due to ribosome pausing at codon $r$, whereas many class $L$ mRNAs are initiation-limited.

It presents a standard, albeit simplified, model of gene translation that is a cornerstone of modern quantitative and systems biology. The concepts of resource allocation, competition for shared resources (ribosomes, tRNAs, synthetases), and the distinction between initiation- and elongation-limited regimes are well-established. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear initial state, a specific perturbation, and a set of rules (assumptions) within which to deduce the consequences. The language is objective and precise. No scientific, logical, or factual flaws are detected. The setup is internally consistent and does not violate fundamental principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Consequences**\n\nThe system described is one of coupled processes limited by shared resources. The perturbation—a large increase ($n \\gg 1$) in the concentration of the tRNA cognate to the rare codon $r$—propagates through this system in several ways.\n\n1.  **Effect on Elongation at Codon $r$**: According to assumption 2, the rate of the elongation step at codon $r$ is an increasing function of the concentration of its correctly charged tRNA. Overexpressing the tRNA for codon $r$ will, after charging, lead to a dramatic increase in the concentration of the required aminoacyl-tRNA. Consequently, the characteristic pause or \"dwell time\" of ribosomes at codon $r$ will be substantially reduced. The elongation rate through these codons, previously a bottleneck for class $H$ mRNAs, will increase significantly.\n\n2.  **Effect on Class $H$ mRNAs**: These mRNAs are initially elongation-limited due to slow decoding of codon $r$. Relieving this bottleneck has two primary effects:\n    - The overall rate of protein synthesis (translational flux) from each class $H$ mRNA increases because the rate-limiting step has been accelerated.\n    - The average ribosome density on these mRNAs decreases. Ribosome density, $\\rho$, can be approximated as the ratio of the initiation rate, $\\alpha$, to the average elongation velocity, $v$. Even if $\\alpha$ increases (see point 3), the alleviation of a strong bottleneck leads to a disproportionately large increase in $v$ as ribosome queues dissipate. Thus, the number of ribosomes occupying a given class $H$ transcript at any moment will decrease.\n\n3.  **Effect on Free Ribosome Pool ($R_{\\mathrm{free}}$)**: The total number of ribosomes engaged in translation is $\\sum_m R_m$. The quantity $R_m$ for a specific mRNA species $m$ is proportional to its transcript number, its ribosome density, and its length. By decreasing ribosome density on the abundant class $H$ mRNAs (as per point 2), the total number of translating ribosomes, $\\sum_m R_m$, will decrease. According to the conservation law $R_{\\mathrm{tot}} = R_{\\mathrm{free}} + \\sum_m R_m$, and given that $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is fixed, a decrease in the engaged ribosome pool must lead to a corresponding increase in the free ribosome pool, $R_{\\mathrm{free}}$.\n\n4.  **Effect on Class $L$ mRNAs**: These mRNAs are defined as being initiation-limited at baseline. According to assumption 3, the initiation rate for such messages is an increasing function of $R_{\\mathrm{free}}$. Since $R_{\\mathrm{free}}$ increases (point 3), the initiation rate on class $L$ mRNAs will rise. For an initiation-limited gene, the protein output rate is determined by the initiation rate. Therefore, the protein output from class $L$ mRNAs is expected to increase. This is an indirect effect mediated by the reallocation of the shared ribosome pool.\n\n5.  **Effect on tRNA Charging Competition**: Assumption 4 specifies that a single synthetase (ArgRS) with finite capacity $V_{\\max}$ is responsible for charging all isoacceptors for a given amino acid (e.g., arginine). Overexpressing one isoacceptor (for codon $r$) by a factor $n \\gg 1$ drastically increases its concentration. According to the principles of competitive substrate kinetics, this highly abundant tRNA will outcompete the other, less abundant, arginine tRNA isoacceptors for binding to the limited ArgRS enzyme. This competition will reduce the charging rate of the other isoacceptors, leading to a lower steady-state fraction of them being charged. A similar competitive effect would occur if the amino acid pool itself became the limiting factor. Consequently, for any mRNA that uses these other arginine codons, the elongation rate at those specific codons will decrease due to the reduced availability of their cognate charged tRNAs (Assumption 2).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Protein output from class $H$ mRNAs increases, while their average ribosome density decreases, due to relief of an elongation bottleneck at codon $r$.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the analysis in point 2. Relieving the elongation bottleneck directly increases the translational flux (protein output). Simultaneously, the faster transit of ribosomes and dissolution of queues reduces the average number of ribosomes per transcript, thereby decreasing ribosome density.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Protein output from class $L$ mRNAs that are initiation-limited increases, despite lacking codon $r$, because $R_{\\mathrm{free}}$ increases when ribosome queues on class $H$ mRNAs resolve.**\nThis statement accurately describes the indirect coupling between the two classes of mRNA. As derived in points 3 and 4, the relief of elongation bottlenecks on class $H$ mRNAs liberates ribosomes into the free pool ($R_{\\mathrm{free}}$), which are then available to increase the initiation rate on the initiation-limited class $L$ mRNAs, thereby increasing their protein output.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. mRNAs enriched for other arginine codons decoded by different arginine tRNA isoacceptors may slow down in elongation if ArgRS charging capacity $V_{\\max}$ or the intracellular arginine pool becomes limiting, decreasing the charged fraction of those other isoacceptors.**\nThis statement correctly identifies a secondary, negative consequence of the perturbation, as detailed in point 5. The massive overexpression of one tRNA isoacceptor creates a new bottleneck at the level of tRNA charging by overwhelming the synthetase's catalytic capacity. This starves other isoacceptors of the same amino acid, reducing their charged fraction and slowing elongation at their corresponding codons.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Global initiation rates decrease because faster elongation at codon $r$ sequesters more ribosomes on class $H$ messages, reducing $R_{\\mathrm{free}}$.**\nThis statement contains faulty logic. Faster elongation does not sequester *more* ribosomes; it reduces the transit time per ribosome, thus sequestering *fewer* ribosomes on the transcript at any given time. This *increases*, not reduces, $R_{\\mathrm{free}}$. An increase in $R_{\\mathrm{free}}$ would lead to an increase, not a decrease, in global initiation rates. The premise and conclusion are both incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The translational gain is uniform across all mRNAs, independent of codon usage, because the total ribosome number $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is conserved.**\nThis statement misinterprets the role of a conserved resource. The very fact that $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is conserved is what creates competition and resource reallocation, leading to *non-uniform* effects. The impact of the perturbation is highly dependent on the initial limitation (initiation vs. elongation) and the specific codon content of each mRNA. Class $H$ gains directly, class $L$ gains indirectly, and mRNAs with other arginine codons may suffer. The gain is far from uniform.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2967259"}]}
