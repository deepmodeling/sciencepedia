Consider a one-dimensional length variable $L(t) \\ge 0$ for an individual microtubule, which evolves as follows. In the growing state $G$, the length increases deterministically at speed $v_g$ so that $\\mathrm{d}L/\\mathrm{d}t = v_g$, and in the shrinking state $S$, the length decreases deterministically at speed $v_s$ so that $\\mathrm{d}L/\\mathrm{d}t = -v_s$. State transitions occur as independent Poisson processes: catastrophes $G \\to S$ occur with frequency $f_c$, and rescues $S \\to G$ occur with frequency $f_r$. Upon reaching $L=0$ while in state $S$, the microtubule disappears. New microtubules are nucleated at $L=0$ in state $G$ at a constant rate $J$, and a statistical steady state is established under the bounded-growth condition $v_s f_c  v_g f_r$.

Derivation of the Governing Ordinary Differential Equation**\n\nLet $x(t)$ be the fraction of active Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), so $x \\in [0, 1]$. The fraction of inactive CDK1 is correspondingly $(1-x)$. The dynamics of $x$ are governed by the balance between activation and inactivation fluxes.\n\n$\\dfrac{dx}{dt} = J_{\\text{act}}(x, u) - J_{\\text{inact}}(x)$\n\nThe activation flux, $J_{\\text{act}}$, is the rate of conversion of inactive CDK1 to active CDK1. It is proportional to the substrate (inactive CDK1, fraction $1-x$) and the activity of the activating enzyme, Cdc25. The total activation capacity is scaled by the dimensionless cyclin abundance, $u$. The activity of Cdc25 is itself promoted by active CDK1, creating a positive feedback loop. This is modeled by a basal activation rate $k_{a0}$ and a feedback-dependent rate $k_{ap} H_{+}(x; K_{p}, n_{p})$.\n\nThe positive feedback Hill function is given as:\n$H_{+}(x; K_{p}, n_{p}) = \\dfrac{x^{n_{p}}}{K_{p}^{n_{p}} + x^{n_{p}}}$\n\nThus, the activation flux is:\n$J_{\\text{act}}(x, u) = u \\left( k_{a0} + k_{ap} H_{+}(x; K_{p}, n_{p}) \\right) (1-x)$\n\nThe inactivation flux, $J_{\\text{inact}}$, is the rate of conversion of active CDK1 back to its inactive state. It is proportional to the substrate (active CDK1, fraction $x$) and the activity of the inactivating enzyme, Wee1. The basal inactivation strength is $k_{i0}$. The activity of Wee1 is inhibited by active CDK1, creating a double-negative feedback which acts as a positive feedback on $x$. This inhibition is modeled by the decreasing Hill function $H_{-}(x; K_{w}, n_{w})$.\n\nThe decreasing Hill function is given as:\n$H_{-}(x; K_{w}, n_{w}) = \\dfrac{1}{1 + \\left(\\dfrac{x}{K_{w}}\\right)^{n_{w}}} = \\dfrac{K_{w}^{n_{w}}}{K_{w}^{n_{w}} + x^{n_{w}}}$\n\nThus, the inactivation flux is:\n$J_{\\text{inact}}(x) = k_{i0} H_{-}(x; K_{w}, n_{w}) x$\n\nCombining these terms, we obtain the full ODE for the fraction of active CDK1:\n$$\n\\dfrac{dx}{dt} = f(x, u) = u \\left( k_{a0} + k_{ap} \\dfrac{x^{n_{p}}}{K_{p}^{n_{p}} + x^{n_{p}}} \\right) (1-x) - k_{i0} \\dfrac{x}{1 + \\left(\\dfrac{x}{K_{w}}\\right)^{n_{w}}}\n$$\nThis equation describes the temporal evolution of CDK1 activity based on the specified molecular interactions.\n\n**2. Stability and Bifurcation Analysis**\n\nSteady states, denoted by $x^{\\ast}$, are solutions to $\\dfrac{dx}{dt} = 0$, which implies $f(x^{\\ast}, u) = 0$. At steady state, the activation and inactivation fluxes are balanced:\n$$\nu \\left( k_{a0} + k_{ap} H_{+}(x^{\\ast}) \\right) (1-x^{\\ast}) = k_{i0} H_{-}(x^{\\ast}) x^{\\ast}\n$$\nThe stability of a steady state $x^{\\ast}$ is determined by the sign of the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$ evaluated at $x^{\\ast}$. A steady state is stable if $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}|_{x=x^{\\ast}}  0$ and unstable if $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}|_{x=x^{\\ast}} > 0$.\n\nA saddle-node (or fold) bifurcation occurs at a point $(x^{\\ast}, u^{\\ast})$ where a stable and an unstable steady state merge and annihilate. Mathematically, this corresponds to the point where the system is at a steady state and the linear stability condition is marginal. The two conditions are:\n1.  Steady-state condition: $f(x^{\\ast}, u^{\\ast}) = 0$\n2.  Bifurcation condition: $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x^{\\ast}, u^{\\ast}) = 0$\n\nThe existence of two distinct saddle-node bifurcations, at $(x_{\\text{up}}, u_{\\text{up}})$ and $(x_{\\text{down}}, u_{\\text{down}})$, gives rise to an S-shaped steady-state curve in the $(u, x)$ plane. For values of the control parameter $u$ between $u_{\\text{down}}$ and $u_{\\text{up}}$, the system has three steady states: a lower stable state, an intermediate unstable state, and an upper stable state. This is the region of bistability.\n\nThis bistability results in hysteresis. As $u$ is slowly increased from a low value, the system follows the lower stable branch. Upon reaching $u = u_{\\text{up}}$, the lower branch ceases to exist, and the system makes an irreversible switch to the upper stable branch. If $u$ is then decreased, the system remains on the upper branch until it reaches $u = u_{\\text{down}}$, at which point it switches back to the lower branch. The state of the system thus depends on the history of the input parameter $u$, which is the hallmark of hysteresis.\n\n**3. Design of the Numerical Algorithm**\n\nTo find the $(x^{\\ast}, u^{\\ast})$ coordinates of the fold points, we must solve the two simultaneous equations $f(x, u)=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x, u)=0$. We can use the first equation to express $u$ as a function of $x$ along the steady-state curve:\n$$\nu(x) = \\frac{J_{\\text{inact}}(x)}{J_{\\text{act}}(x, u=1)} = \\frac{k_{i0} H_{-}(x) x}{\\left( k_{a0} + k_{ap} H_{+}(x) \\right) (1-x)}\n$$\nA fold bifurcation corresponds to a point where the steady-state curve has a vertical tangent in the $(u, x)$ plane, meaning $\\dfrac{du}{dx} = 0$. This condition can be used to derive a single equation whose roots are the $x$-coordinates of the fold points. Let the activation term be $A(x) = k_{a0} + k_{ap} H_{+}(x)$ and the inactivation term be $I(x) = k_{i0} H_{-}(x) x$. Substituting $u(x)$ from the steady state condition into the bifurcation condition $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 0$ leads to an equation $g(x)=0$ which can be solved for $x^{\\ast}$.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  For a given set of parameters, construct a function $g(x)$ whose roots correspond to the $x$-coordinates of the fold points. This function is derived from the conditions $f(x,u)=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x,u)=0$. The derivatives involved are:\n    $A'(x) = k_{ap} \\dfrac{n_{p} K_{p}^{n_{p}} x^{n_{p}-1}}{(K_{p}^{n_{p}} + x^{n_{p}})^2}$\n    $I'(x)$ is the derivative of $k_{i0} \\frac{x K_w^{n_w}}{K_w^{n_w} + x^{n_w}}$, which is $k_{i0} K_w^{n_w} \\frac{K_w^{n_w} + (1-n_w)x^{n_w}}{(K_w^{n_w} + x^{n_w})^2}$.\n\n2.  Numerically find roots of $g(x) = 0$ in the interval $x \\in (0, 1)$. This is done by partitioning the interval into a large number of subintervals and searching for sign changes of $g(x)$, indicating a root.\n\n3.  For each subinterval $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$ where $g(x_i) \\cdot g(x_{i+1})  0$, a root-finding algorithm (e.g., Brent's method) is used to find the root $x^{\\ast}$ to machine precision.\n\n4.  For each root $x^{\\ast}$, the corresponding bifurcation parameter $u^{\\ast}$ is calculated using the steady-state equation: $u^{\\ast} = u(x^{\\ast})$.\n\n5.  The found pairs $(x^{\\ast}, u^{\\ast})$ are filtered to include only those where $u^{\\ast}$ falls within the specified range $[u_{\\min}, u_{\\max}]$.\n\n6.  If at least two valid fold points are found, the system is bistable. The bistability flag $b$ is set to $1$. The minimum and maximum of the valid $u^{\\ast}$ values are reported as $u_{\\text{down}}$ and $u_{\\text{up}}$. Otherwise, $b$ is set to $0$ and both $u$-values are set to $-1.0$.\n\nThis procedure provides a robust method to determine the existence and bounds of the hysteretic region for the given cell-cycle control model.", "answer": "[[1,0.208,0.407],[0,-1.000,-1.000],[0,-1.000,-1.000],[1,0.245,0.354]]", "id": "2951858"}]}
