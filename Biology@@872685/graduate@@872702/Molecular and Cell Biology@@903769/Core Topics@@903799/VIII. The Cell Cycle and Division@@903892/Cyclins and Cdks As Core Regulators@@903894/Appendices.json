It describes a standard competitive ligand binding scenario, a fundamental topic in biochemistry. All necessary parameters are provided, and the assumptions are clearly stated and physically reasonable for an *in vitro* system. The problem is valid.\n\nLet us denote the molecular species as follows: $K$ for free CDK2, $A$ for free Cyclin A, and $I$ for free p27 inhibitor. The complexes are $KA$ (CDK2:Cyclin A) and $KI$ (CDK2:p27). The total concentration of CDK2 is $[K]_T$. The problem states that only the $KA$ complex is catalytically active.\n\nThe system is governed by two reversible binding equilibria:\n$$K + A \\rightleftharpoons KA$$\n$$K + I \\rightleftharpoons KI$$\n\nUnder the law of mass action, these equilibria are described by their respective dissociation constants, $K_{d,A}$ and $K_{d,I}$:\n$$K_{d,A} = \\frac{[K][A]}{[KA]}$$\n$$K_{d,I} = \\frac{[K][I]}{[KI]}$$\n\nThe total concentration of CDK2 is conserved, according to the principle of mass conservation. Since binding is mutually exclusive, the total CDK2 is the sum of the free form and the two complexed forms:\n$$[K]_T = [K] + [KA] + [KI]$$\n\nFrom the equilibrium expressions, we can express the concentrations of the complexes in terms of the free CDK2 concentration, $[K]$:\n$$[KA] = \\frac{[K][A]}{K_{d,A}}$$\n$$[KI] = \\frac{[K][I]}{K_{d,I}}$$\n\nSubstituting these into the conservation equation for CDK2 gives:\n$$[K]_T = [K] + \\frac{[K][A]}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{[K][I]}{K_{d,I}} = [K] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{[I]}{K_{d,I}} \\right)$$\n\nThe problem states that the total ligand concentrations, $[A]_T$ and $[I]_T$, are much larger than the total CDK2 concentration, $[K]_T$.

It is free of subjectivity or opinion.\n-   **Other Flaws**: The problem does not violate any other criteria. It is not incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, ill-posed, or trivial. It is a formalizable problem directly relevant to the topic.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe core principle for solving this problem is the steady-state assumption, which dictates that the rate of formation of the phospho-form $C_P$ must equal its rate of removal. The rate of formation of $C_P$ is the phosphorylation rate $v_W$, and the rate of its removal is the dephosphorylation rate $v_C$.\n\nTherefore, at steady state:\n$$v_W = v_C$$\nWe are given the specific expressions for these rates. Substituting them into the steady-state condition yields:\n$$\\left(\\frac{k_{cat}^W}{K_M^W}\\right) W_T [C] = V_{max}^C$$\nOur goal is to find the inhibited fraction, $f^\\ast = \\frac{[C_P]}{C_T}$. The current equation involves $[C]$, not $[C_P]$. We must use the conservation relation, $[C] + [C_P] = C_T$, to express $[C]$ in terms of $[C_P]$ and the total concentration $C_T$.\nFrom the conservation relation, we have:\n$$[C] = C_T - [C_P]$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[C]$ into the steady-state equation:\n$$\\left(\\frac{k_{cat}^W}{K_M^W}\\right) W_T (C_T - [C_P]) = V_{max}^C$$\nThis is an algebraic equation for the steady-state concentration $[C_P]$. We must solve for $[C_P]$. First, distribute the term on the left-hand side:\n$$\\left(\\frac{k_{cat}^W}{K_M^W}\\right) W_T C_T - \\left(\\frac{k_{cat}^W}{K_M^W}\\right) W_T [C_P] = V_{max}^C$$\nRearrange the equation to isolate the term containing $[C_P]$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{k_{cat}^W}{K_M^W}\\right) W_T [C_P] = \\left(\\frac{k_{cat}^W}{K_M^W}\\right) W_T C_T - V_{max}^C$$\nNow, solve for $[C_P]$ by dividing both sides by the coefficient of $[C_P]$:\n$$[C_P] = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{k_{cat}^W}{K_M^W}\\right) W_T C_T - V_{max}^C}{\\left(\\frac{k_{cat}^W}{K_M^W}\\right) W_T}$$\nThis expression can be simplified by dividing each term in the numerator by the denominator:\n$$[C_P] = C_T - \\frac{V_{max}^C}{\\left(\\frac{k_{cat}^W}{K_M^W}\\right) W_T}$$\nWe have now found the steady-state concentration of the inhibited form, $[C_P]$, as a function of the given parameters. The final step is to compute the inhibited fraction, $f^\\ast$, using its definition, $f^\\ast = \\frac{[C_P]}{C_T}$.\n$$f^\\ast = \\frac{1}{C_T} \\left( C_T - \\frac{V_{max}^C}{\\left(\\frac{k_{cat}^W}{K_M^W}\\right) W_T} \\right)$$\nDistributing the $\\frac{1}{C_T}$ term, we obtain the final closed-form expression for $f^\\ast$:\n$$f^\\ast = 1 - \\frac{V_{max}^C}{C_T W_T \\left(\\frac{k_{cat}^W}{K_M^W}\\right)}$$\nFor this steady-state solution to be physically meaningful, the fraction $f^\\ast$ must be between $0$ and $1$. The condition $f^\\ast < 1$ is always met, as all parameters are positive physical quantities. The condition $f^\\ast > 0$ requires that $1 > \\frac{V_{max}^C}{C_T W_T \\left(\\frac{k_{cat}^W}{K_M^W}\\right)}$, which rearranges to $C_T W_T \\left(\\frac{k_{cat}^W}{K_M^W}\\right) > V_{max}^C$. This inequality has a clear physical interpretation: for a non-zero fraction of inhibited CDK1 to exist at steady state, the maximum possible rate of phosphorylation (which occurs when all CDK1 is active, i.e., $[C] = C_T$) must be greater than the fixed rate of dephosphorylation. If this condition is not met, the dephosphorylation reaction outpaces phosphorylation under all conditions, and the only stable steady state corresponds to $[C_P] = 0$, i.e., $f^\\ast = 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1 - \\frac{V_{max}^C}{C_T W_T \\left(\\frac{k_{cat}^W}{K_M^W}\\right)}}$$", "id": "2940325"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate test of our understanding is the ability to predict how the entire system behaves when a critical component is altered.

The mutation does not affect Cyclin B synthesis, Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) binding, or kinase activity, and the spindle assembly checkpoint is satisfied under the imaging conditions. The cells are synchronized at the boundary between $G_{2}$ and $M$ phase and released. The investigators track mitotic entry by nuclear envelope breakdown, anaphase onset by a separase activity biosensor, and mitotic exit by dephosphorylation of canonical CDK substrates. In parallel, they quantify turnover of APC/C substrates by immunoblotting and proteasome-inhibited polyubiquitination assays, examining Cyclin B, Securin, and late APC/C coactivator Cell Division Cycle 20 (Cdc20) and APC/C activator Cdc20 homolog 1 (Cdh1) substrates such as Geminin.\n\nUsing only core principles that (i) cyclins activate cyclin-dependent kinases, (ii) APC/C is an E$3$ ubiquitin ligase whose coactivators Cdc20 and Cdh1 confer substrate recognition based on degrons such as the D-box and KEN-box, (iii) protein steady-state levels reflect the balance of synthesis and degradation, and (iv) mitotic exit requires both Securin destruction and CDK downregulation to enable Separase and phosphatase activation, predict the most likely combined outcome for mitotic entry and exit and the expected pattern of APC/C substrate turnover in these D-box mutant Cyclin B cells.\n\nWhich option best matches the expected observations?\n\nA. Mitotic entry occurs with near-normal timing; anaphase onset fails and mitotic exit is blocked because high Cyclin B–CDK1 activity persists. In APC/C assays, Securin is robustly polyubiquitinated and degraded once the spindle assembly checkpoint is satisfied, whereas the D-box mutant Cyclin B is not detectably polyubiquitinated and remains stable. Because CDK activity does not decline, Cdh1 remains inhibited, so late APC/C$^{\\mathrm{Cdh}1}$ substrates (for example, Geminin) and Cdc20 itself fail to turn over.\n\nB. Mitotic entry is delayed because the mutant Cyclin B dominantly sequesters APC/C, and mitotic exit is accelerated because Cyclin B cannot bind APC/C and is therefore degraded faster by Skp1–Cullin–F-box complexes. In APC/C assays, both Securin and Cyclin B show reduced polyubiquitination, while late APC/C$^{\\mathrm{Cdh}1}$ substrates are cleared normally.\n\nC. Mitotic entry is normal and anaphase proceeds with only a slight delay because Securin is degraded; mitotic exit completes, but cytokinesis fails due to excess Cyclin B.

Mitotic entry is advanced due to elevated Cyclin B levels; mitotic exit is unaffected because Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) compensates for sustained CDK activity.

The experimental setup described (knock-in mutation, cell synchronization, biosensors) is standard in modern cell biology research. All molecules and processes mentioned (Cyclin B, CDK1, APC/C, Cdc20, Cdh1, D-box, etc.) are real and their functions are well-characterized.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The initial conditions ($G_2$/$M$ arrest), the specific perturbation (D-box mutation), and the core principles to be used are all clearly defined. This structure allows for a unique, logical deduction of the system's behavior.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is technical, precise, and devoid of subjective claims.\n\nThe problem does not violate any criteria for invalidity. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, or ill-posed. It presents a standard, yet non-trivial, conceptual problem in cell cycle regulation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe problem requires predicting the phenotype of cells expressing a non-degradable Cyclin B. Let us reason through the mitotic progression step-by-step based on the provided principles.\n\n1. **Mitotic Entry**: The cells are synchronized at the $G_2$/$M$ boundary, a point where Cyclin B–CDK1 activity is naturally high and poised to trigger M-phase events. The problem states that the mutant Cyclin B forms an active kinase with CDK1 normally. Therefore, upon release from synchrony, these cells will experience high CDK1 activity, leading to phosphorylation of mitotic substrates and subsequent nuclear envelope breakdown. Mitotic entry will thus occur with timing comparable to wild-type cells.\n\n2. **Metaphase-to-Anaphase Transition**: As cells progress to metaphase, chromosomes align at the metaphase plate. The problem specifies that the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is satisfied. The satisfaction of the SAC relieves its inhibition on the APC/C coactivator Cdc20, leading to the formation of active APC/C$^{Cdc20}$.\nThe primary substrates of APC/C$^{Cdc20}$ are Securin and mitotic cyclins (like Cyclin B).\n- Securin, which contains both D-box and KEN-box degrons, is a valid substrate and will be targeted for polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.\n- The mutant Cyclin B, however, has a mutated D-box that abolishes APC/C recognition. Consequently, it will not be ubiquitinated and will remain stable.\n\n3. **Anaphase Onset**: Anaphase onset is triggered by the activation of Separase, a protease that cleaves the cohesin rings holding sister chromatids together. Separase activity is inhibited by two mechanisms: binding to Securin and inhibitory phosphorylation by CDK1. The degradation of Securin is the primary trigger for Separase activation. However, sustained high CDK1 activity can maintain inhibitory phosphorylation on Separase, preventing its full activation. In this experimental system, Cyclin B–CDK1 activity will remain maximally high because Cyclin B is non-degradable. Even with Securin removed, this persistent high CDK activity is sufficient to block Separase function. Therefore, the biosensor will not detect Separase activity, sister chromatids will not separate, and anaphase onset will fail. The cell will arrest in a metaphase-like state.\n\n4. **Mitotic Exit**: Mitotic exit is defined by the reversal of mitotic phosphorylations, which requires the inactivation of CDK1. Since Cyclin B cannot be degraded, CDK1 activity remains high indefinitely. This blocks mitotic exit by definition. A key event in mitotic exit is the dephosphorylation and activation of the APC/C coactivator Cdh1. Cdh1 activation requires low CDK activity. Because CDK1 activity remains high, Cdh1 stays phosphorylated and inactive. Consequently, the APC/C$^{Cdh1}$ E3 ligase is never formed. Substrates normally degraded by APC/C$^{Cdh1}$ in late mitosis and $G_1$—such as Cdc20 itself, Geminin, and other mitotic proteins—will not be degraded. They will remain stable.\n\n**Summary of Predictions**:\n- **Mitotic Entry**: Normal.\n- **Anaphase Onset**: Fails due to persistent inhibition of Separase by high CDK1 activity.\n- **Mitotic Exit**: Blocked due to high, stable CDK1 activity.\n- **Substrate Turnover**: Securin is polyubiquitinated and degraded. The D-box mutant Cyclin B is stable. APC/C$^{Cdh1}$ substrates (e.g., Geminin) and Cdc20 are also stabilized due to the failure to activate Cdh1.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Mitotic entry occurs with near-normal timing; anaphase onset fails and mitotic exit is blocked because high Cyclin B–CDK1 activity persists. In APC/C assays, Securin is robustly polyubiquitinated and degraded once the spindle assembly checkpoint is satisfied, whereas the D-box mutant Cyclin B is not detectably polyubiquitinated and remains stable. Because CDK activity does not decline, Cdh1 remains inhibited, so late APC/C$^{\\mathrm{Cdh}1}$ substrates (for example, Geminin) and Cdc20 itself fail to turn over.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with our detailed analysis. It correctly predicts normal mitotic entry, failed anaphase onset due to high CDK1 activity, a complete block in mitotic exit, the differential degradation of Securin but not mutant Cyclin B, and the failure to activate APC/C$^{Cdh1}$ and degrade its substrates.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Mitotic entry is delayed because the mutant Cyclin B dominantly sequesters APC/C, and mitotic exit is accelerated because Cyclin B cannot bind APC/C and is therefore degraded faster by Skp1–Cullin–F-box complexes. In APC/C assays, both Securin and Cyclin B show reduced polyubiquitination, while late APC/C$^{\\mathrm{Cdh}1}$ substrates are cleared normally.**\nThis option is incorrect for multiple reasons. 1) The mutation abolishes APC/C binding, so it cannot sequester it; mitotic entry should be normal. 2) Mitotic exit is blocked, not accelerated. 3) Mitotic cyclins are not substrates for SCF complexes. 4) Securin ubiquitination should be robust, not reduced. 5) APC/C$^{Cdh1}$ is not activated, so its substrates are not cleared.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Mitotic entry is normal and anaphase proceeds with only a slight delay because Securin is degraded; mitotic exit completes, but cytokinesis fails due to excess Cyclin B. In APC/C assays, Securin is stabilized due to competitive inhibition by the mutant Cyclin B, whereas Cyclin B is polyubiquitinated through an alternative KEN-box, and late APC/C$^{\\mathrm{Cdh}1}$ substrates are unaffected.**\nThis option contains several errors. 1) Mitotic exit cannot complete if Cyclin B–CDK1 activity is high. 2) Securin is not stabilized by competitive inhibition; the mutant Cyclin B does not bind APC/C. 3) The problem states APC/C recognition is abolished, contradicting the idea of degradation via an alternative degron. 4) Anaphase onset is expected to fail, not proceed.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Mitotic entry is advanced due to elevated Cyclin B levels; mitotic exit is unaffected because Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) compensates for sustained CDK activity. In APC/C assays, global substrate polyubiquitination is unchanged because SCF complexes compensate for loss of APC/C recognition of Cyclin B.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. 1) Cyclin B synthesis is normal, not elevated, so mitotic entry timing should be normal, not advanced. 2) Phosphatases cannot \"compensate\" for constitutively active CDK1; this view contradicts the bistable switch model of mitotic control. Mitotic exit is blocked. 3) SCF complexes do not degrade mitotic cyclins, so they cannot compensate. 4) Global substrate polyubiquitination is drastically changed because a major substrate (Cyclin B) and all APC/C$^{Cdh1}$ substrates are stabilized.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2940299"}]}
