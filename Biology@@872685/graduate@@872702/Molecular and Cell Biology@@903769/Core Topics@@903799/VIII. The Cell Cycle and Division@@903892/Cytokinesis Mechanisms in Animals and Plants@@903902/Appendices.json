The system is in the low Reynolds number regime, where inertial effects are negligible. Therefore, the net force on the contractile ring is zero at all times. This implies that the active contractile force is exactly balanced by the sum of the resistive forces.\n\nThe principle is the force balance equation:\n$$F_{\\text{contractile}} = \\sum F_{\\text{resistive}}$$\nwhere all terms represent the magnitudes of the forces.\n\nWe must identify each force component based on the givens.\n\n1.  **Contractile Force ($F_{\\text{contractile}}$)**: The problem states that the actomyosin ring generates a net contractile force of magnitude $F$. This force drives the inward movement of the furrow.\n    $$F_{\\text{contractile}} = F$$\n\n2.  **Resistive Forces ($F_{\\text{resistive}}$)**: Two resistive forces oppose the contraction.\n\n    a. **Force due to Surface Tension ($F_{\\text{tension}}$)**: The cortical surface tension $\\tau$ gives rise to a resistive force. The problem states that a surface with tension $\\tau$ exerts a line traction of magnitude $\\tau$ per unit length on its boundary. For the circular contractile ring of radius $R$, the boundary is its circumference, which has a length of $2\\pi R$. This tension pulls the ring outward, resisting contraction. The magnitude of this force is the line traction multiplied by the length of the circumference:\n    $$F_{\\text{tension}} = \\tau \\cdot (2\\pi R) = 2\\pi R \\tau$$\n\n    b. **Force due to Viscous Drag ($F_{\\text{visc}}$)**: The movement of the ring through the viscous cytoplasm with viscosity $\\eta$ generates a drag force. The furrow ingression speed is defined as $v(R) \\equiv -\\dot{R}$, where $\\dot{R} = \\frac{dR}{dt}$ is the radial velocity of the ring. Since the ring is contracting, $\\dot{R}$ is negative, and $v(R)$ is positive. The problem gives the form of the viscous resistance as $F_{\\text{visc}}(R,\\dot{R}) = 6\\pi \\eta R \\dot{R}$ opposing the motion. A drag force must have a direction opposite to the velocity. The inward velocity is $\\dot{R}$. Therefore, the drag force must be directed outward, and its expression as a function of the speed $v = |\\dot{R}| = -\\dot{R}$ is obtained from the provided formula by considering its magnitude. The magnitude of the viscous drag force is:\n    $$F_{\\text{visc}} = |6\\pi \\eta R \\dot{R}| = 6\\pi \\eta R |\\dot{R}| = 6\\pi \\eta R v(R)$$\n\nNow, we formulate the force balance equation by equating the magnitude of the contractile force to the sum of the magnitudes of the resistive forces:\n$$F = F_{\\text{tension}} + F_{\\text{visc}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for each force, we obtain:\n$$F = 2\\pi R \\tau + 6\\pi \\eta R v(R)$$\nThe goal is to find an expression for the instantaneous furrow ingression speed, $v(R)$. We must solve the above equation for $v(R)$.\nRearranging the equation to isolate the term containing $v(R)$:\n$$6\\pi \\eta R v(R) = F - 2\\pi R \\tau$$\nFinally, dividing by the coefficient $6\\pi \\eta R$ yields the expression for $v(R)$:\n$$v(R) = \\frac{F - 2\\pi R \\tau}{6\\pi \\eta R}$$\nThis expression can be simplified by splitting the fraction:\n$$v(R) = \\frac{F}{6\\pi \\eta R} - \\frac{2\\pi R \\tau}{6\\pi \\eta R} = \\frac{F}{6\\pi \\eta R} - \\frac{\\tau}{3\\eta}$$\nHowever, the single fraction form is more directly representative of the underlying force balance. This is the closed-form expression for the furrow ingression speed in terms of the given parameters.

Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) measures molecular exchange at a region of interest; slower recovery and a smaller mobile fraction indicate more stable or long-lived binding interactions, whereas faster recovery and a larger mobile fraction indicate rapid turnover.

The contractile ring composition (actin, NMII, scaffolds like anillin) and the phragmoplast structure (microtubules, vesicles, motors, crosslinkers) are textbook facts.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a logical deduction.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nDerivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is the correct interpretation of the provided FRAP data in the context of cytokinesis.\n\n1.  **Interpretation of FRAP Data:**\n    -   **Anillin:** Exhibits a long recovery half-time ($t_{1/2} = 55\\,\\mathrm{s}$) and a small mobile fraction ($40\\%$). This signifies that anillin molecules exchange slowly with the cytoplasmic pool. Furthermore, a large portion ($100\\% - 40\\% = 60\\%$) is effectively immobile on the timescale of the experiment. These characteristics—slow turnover and a large, stable bound population—are the hallmarks of a structural or scaffolding protein. Its role is likely to provide a stable anchor and organizational framework for the contractile ring.\n    -   **Nonmuscle Myosin II (NMII):** Exhibits a short recovery half-time ($t_{1/2} = 8\\,\\mathrm{s}$) and a large mobile fraction ($85\\%$). This signifies that NMII molecules exchange very rapidly. The small immobile fraction ($15\\%$) and fast turnover are characteristic of a dynamic component. This is consistent with its known function as a molecular motor that generates force through rapid cycles of binding to actin, executing a power stroke, and unbinding. This dynamic behavior is essential for sustained contractility.\n\n2.  **Synthesis and Analogy:**\n    -   In animal cells, there is a clear division of labor: anillin acts as a stable scaffold, while NMII acts as a dynamic force generator.\n    -   In plant cells, cytokinesis also requires both structural organization and dynamic activity. The phragmoplast provides a microtubule-based framework for building the cell plate.\n    -   **Structural Analogue (like anillin):** Components that stabilize the phragmoplast structure, such as microtubule crosslinkers (e.g., MAP$65$) that bundle antiparallel microtubules, or tethering complexes (e.g., exocyst) that dock vesicles prior to fusion, are expected to be relatively static. They would show slow FRAP recovery and a small mobile fraction.\n    -   **Dynamic Analogue (like NMII):** Components that actively transport materials, such as motor proteins (e.g., kinesins and myosins) that move vesicles along microtubule tracks to the cell plate midline, are expected to be highly dynamic. They would show fast FRAP recovery and a large mobile fraction.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option based on this reasoning.\n\n**A. The anillin data (slow recovery, small mobile fraction) indicate a scaffold that stabilizes the ring and cortex, while the NMII data (fast recovery, large mobile fraction) indicate dynamic turnover supporting contractile force generation. By analogy, in plants, structural scaffolds at the forming cell plate such as microtubule crosslinkers (for example, MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN $65$) or membrane tethering and fusion assemblies would exhibit slower FRAP recovery than vesicle-transport motors (for example, kinesin and myosin XI) that turn over rapidly.**\nThis option presents a perfectly coherent and correct analysis. It correctly interprets the anillin FRAP data as indicative of a scaffold and the NMII data as indicative of a dynamic motor. The analogy drawn to plant cytokinesis is also correct, properly distinguishing between the expected dynamics of structural elements (crosslinkers, tethering complexes) and transport elements (motors).\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The NMII data (fast recovery, large mobile fraction) indicate that myosin is the primary static scaffold, because a larger mobile fraction implies stronger binding, whereas the anillin data indicate a highly dynamic force generator. By analogy, in plants, kinesins would be static and tethering factors would be highly dynamic.**\nThis option fundamentally misinterprets the principles of FRAP. A large mobile fraction and fast recovery indicate *weak* or *transient* binding and rapid turnover, the opposite of a static scaffold. It incorrectly assigns the dynamic role to the stable anillin and the static role to the dynamic NMII. Consequently, the analogy to the plant system is also inverted and incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Because both anillin and NMII show partial recovery, they must be equally structural; FRAP cannot distinguish stability from dynamics here. In plants, there is no analogous division of labor, because all components must be static to build a new wall.**\nThis option contains multiple falsehoods. First, the statement that FRAP cannot distinguish stability from dynamics is incorrect; the large quantitative differences in recovery half-time ($55\\,\\mathrm{s}$ vs $8\\,\\mathrm{s}$) and mobile fraction ($40\\%$ vs $85\\%$) are precisely what allow for this distinction. They are clearly not \"equally structural.\" Second, the claim that all components in plant cytokinesis must be static is a gross oversimplification and is factually wrong. The construction of the cell plate is an intensely dynamic process involving vesicle transport, fusion, and cytoskeletal rearrangement.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The slower anillin recovery must arise from membrane diffusion limits rather than binding interactions, so neither anillin nor NMII provides structural stability. In plants, the primary static element is filamentous actin, not scaffolding proteins or microtubule-associated factors.**\nThis option's initial premise is explicitly contradicted by an assumption given in the problem statement: \"assume that the cortex is not diffusion-limited at the spatial scale probed.\" Therefore, the conclusion based on this premise is invalid. Furthermore, the claim about plant cytokinesis is biologically inaccurate. The primary structural framework of the phragmoplast is the assembly of antiparallel microtubules, which are organized and stabilized by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), not primarily filamentous actin.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, only option A provides a scientifically sound interpretation of the experimental data and a correct biological analogy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2940526"}]}
