It is a well-posed exercise in deterministic chemical kinetics, applying a standard birth-death process model to mRNA population dynamics.\n\nLet $N(t)$ denote the copy number of the specific mRNA species at time $t$.

The degradation is a first-order process with rate constant $k_d$, making the degradation rate equal to the product $k_d N(t)$. The governing ordinary differential equation, based on these first principles, is:\n$$ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = k_s - k_d N(t) $$\nA steady state is achieved when the copy number of the mRNA no longer changes over time. This condition, expressed as $\\frac{dN}{dt} = 0$, implies that the production and degradation rates are perfectly balanced. Let $N_{ss}$ be the steady-state copy number. Applying this condition to the governing equation gives:\n$$ 0 = k_s - k_d N_{ss} $$\nSolving this algebraic equation for $N_{ss}$ provides the general expression for the steady-state copy number as a function of the kinetic parameters:\n$$ k_d N_{ss} = k_s $$\n$$ N_{ss} = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} $$\nThis completes the required derivation.\n\nWe must now calculate the new steady-state copy number after viral infection.
