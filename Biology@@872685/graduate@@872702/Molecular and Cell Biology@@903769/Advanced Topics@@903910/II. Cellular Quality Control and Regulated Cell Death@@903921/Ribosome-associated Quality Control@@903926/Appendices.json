Once initiated, a ribosome elongates deterministically at speed $v$ (codons per second) until it encounters a programmed stall located at codon position $200$, where it pauses for a fixed dwell time $\\tau$ before resuming elongation. Consider Ribosome-Associated Quality Control (RQC), which is triggered by ribosome collisions when a trailing ribosome arrives at the same codon position as a paused leading ribosome. Assume the following:\n- Initiations are independent and memoryless as in a homogeneous Poisson process.\n- Elongation is deterministic at constant speed $v$ up to the stall.\n- The leading ribosome of interest initiates at time $t=0$ and is the one that stalls.\n- Collisions occur if a trailing ribosome reaches the stall codon while the leading ribosome remains paused.\n- Ignore steric occlusion at the start codon, any re-initiation constraints, and any footprint exclusion effects between ribosomes other than the collision condition defined above.\n- The open reading frame (ORF) length is $600$ codons, ensuring that termination does not occur before or during the stall.\n\nUsing only the definitions of a homogeneous Poisson process and deterministic motion, derive from first principles an expression for the probability that at least one collision occurs during the stall of duration $\\tau$, and then evaluate it for $k_i=0.2\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, $v=5\\,\\text{codons s}^{-1}$, a stall at codon $200$ with $\\tau=10\\,\\text{s}$, and ORF length $600$ codons.

It is self-contained and free of contradictions. The assumptions provided, such as a homogeneous Poisson process for initiation and deterministic elongation, are standard for simplified models of protein translation. We may proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the probability that at least one collision occurs at a programmed stall site and then to evaluate this probability using the given parameters. The derivation must be from first principles.\n\nLet the start of the open reading frame (ORF) be at position $x=0$. Ribosome initiations occur at this position according to a homogeneous Poisson process with a constant rate $k_i$. The elongation speed along the mRNA is a deterministic constant, $v$. A stall site is located at codon position $p=200$. The duration of the pause at this stall site is a fixed time $\\tau$.\n\nLet us first analyze the trajectory of the leading ribosome, which is defined to initiate at time $t=0$. The time it takes for this ribosome to travel from the initiation site to the stall site at position $p$ is given by:\n$$ t_{travel} = \\frac{p}{v} $$\nThe leading ribosome therefore arrives at the stall site at time $t_{arrive, lead} = 0 + t_{travel} = \\frac{p}{v}$. It remains paused at this position for a duration $\\tau$. Thus, the leading ribosome occupies the stall site during the time interval $[t_1, t_2]$, where:\n$$ t_1 = \\frac{p}{v} $$\n$$ t_2 = \\frac{p}{v} + \\tau $$\n\nNow, consider a trailing ribosome that initiates at some later time $t' > 0$. Since elongation is deterministic, this trailing ribosome will also travel at speed $v$. The time it takes for this ribosome to reach the stall site is also $t_{travel} = \\frac{p}{v}$. Its arrival time at the stall site is:\n$$ t_{arrive, trail}(t') = t' + \\frac{p}{v} $$\n\nA collision occurs if a trailing ribosome arrives at the stall site while the leading ribosome is still paused there. This means the arrival time of the trailing ribosome, $t_{arrive, trail}(t')$, must fall within the interval $[t_1, t_2]$. The condition for a collision is:\n$$ \\frac{p}{v} \\le t_{arrive, trail}(t') \\le \\frac{p}{v} + \\tau $$\nSubstituting the expression for $t_{arrive, trail}(t')$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{p}{v} \\le t' + \\frac{p}{v} \\le \\frac{p}{v} + \\tau $$\nSubtracting $\\frac{p}{v}$ from all parts of the inequality yields the condition on the initiation time $t'$ of the trailing ribosome:\n$$ 0 \\le t' \\le \\tau $$\nSince a trailing ribosome must initiate after the leading one ($t' > 0$), the condition is more precisely $0 < t' \\le \\tau$. This shows that a collision will occur if and only if at least one trailing ribosome initiates translation in the time interval $(0, \\tau]$.\n\nThe problem states that ribosome initiations are events of a homogeneous Poisson process with rate $k_i$. The number of events, $N$, occurring in any time interval of duration $\\Delta t$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda = k_i \\Delta t$. The probability of observing $n$ events in this interval is given by the probability mass function:\n$$ P(N=n) = \\frac{\\lambda^n \\exp(-\\lambda)}{n!} = \\frac{(k_i \\Delta t)^n \\exp(-k_i \\Delta t)}{n!} $$\n\nWe are interested in the number of initiations, let us call it $N_{coll}$, in the time interval $(0, \\tau]$, which has a duration of $\\Delta t = \\tau$. The mean number of initiations in this interval is $\\lambda = k_i \\tau$. The probability of at least one collision, $P_{coll}$, is the probability that the number of initiations in this interval is one or more, i.e., $P(N_{coll} \\ge 1)$.\n\nIt is most direct to calculate this probability using the complement rule: the probability of at least one event is $1$ minus the probability of zero events.\n$$ P_{coll} = P(N_{coll} \\ge 1) = 1 - P(N_{coll} = 0) $$\nUsing the Poisson probability mass function for $n=0$:\n$$ P(N_{coll} = 0) = \\frac{(k_i \\tau)^0 \\exp(-k_i \\tau)}{0!} $$\nSince $x^0 = 1$ and $0! = 1$, this simplifies to:\n$$ P(N_{coll} = 0) = \\exp(-k_i \\tau) $$\nTherefore, the probability of at least one collision is:\n$$ P_{coll} = 1 - \\exp(-k_i \\tau) $$\nThis is the general expression derived from first principles.\n\nWe are asked to evaluate this expression for the given parameters: $k_i = 0.2\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, $v = 5\\,\\text{codons s}^{-1}$, stall position $p=200$ codons, and stall duration $\\tau = 10\\,\\text{s}$. Note that the values of $v$ and $p$ were necessary for the derivation to establish the physical scenario and the relevant time window, but they do not appear in the final probability formula.\n\nFirst, we calculate the argument of the exponential, which is the mean number of initiating ribosomes that would cause a collision:\n$$ \\lambda = k_i \\tau = (0.2\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (10\\,\\text{s}) = 2 $$\nThis is a dimensionless quantity, as expected.\n\nNow, we compute the probability:\n$$ P_{coll} = 1 - \\exp(-2) $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ P_{coll} \\approx 1 - 0.13533528... $$\n$$ P_{coll} \\approx 0.86466471... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P_{coll} \\approx 0.8647 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8647}$$", "id": "2963829"}, {"introduction": "Once a ribosome collision is detected, the RQC pathway relies on the precise enzymatic activity of key proteins.

We may proceed.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts: first, the derivation of the initial rate expression from fundamental principles, and second, the calculation of the inhibited rate under specific conditions.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the initial rate expression $v_{0}$.\n\nWe begin with the elementary reaction scheme for a single-substrate enzyme-catalyzed reaction:\n$$E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_{\\text{cat}}}{\\rightarrow} E + P$$\nHere, $E$ represents the enzyme (Hel2), $S$ is the substrate (collided ribosomes), $ES$ is the enzyme-substrate complex, and $P$ is the product (ubiquitinated ribosome).

It is proportional to the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex, $[ES]$:\n$$v_0 = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{\\text{cat}} [ES]$$\n\nWe apply the steady-state approximation, which assumes that the concentration of the intermediate complex, $[ES]$, remains constant over the initial period of the reaction. This means its rate of formation is equal to its rate of breakdown:\n$$\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = 0$$\nRate of formation of $ES = k_1 [E][S]$.\nRate of breakdown of $ES = k_{-1} [ES] + k_{\\text{cat}} [ES] = (k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}) [ES]$.\n\nEquating these rates gives:\n$$k_1 [E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}) [ES]$$\n\nWe introduce the Michaelis constant, $K_{M}$, which is defined as:\n$$K_{M} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_1}$$\nSubstituting this definition into the steady-state equation yields:\n$$k_1 [E][S] = k_1 K_{M} [ES]$$\n$$[E][S] = K_{M} [ES]$$\n\nThe total enzyme concentration, $[E]_{\\text{tot}}$, is the sum of the free enzyme, $[E]$, and the enzyme bound in the complex, $[ES]$:\n$$[E]_{\\text{tot}} = [E] + [ES]$$\nFrom this, we express the free enzyme concentration as $[E] = [E]_{\\text{tot}} - [ES]$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $[E]$ into our rearranged steady-state equation:\n$$([E]_{\\text{tot}} - [ES])[S] = K_{M} [ES]$$\n\nWe now must solve for $[ES]$:\n$$[E]_{\\text{tot}}[S] - [ES][S] = K_{M}[ES]$$\n$$[E]_{\\text{tot}}[S] = K_{M}[ES] + [ES][S]$$\n$$[E]_{\\text{tot}}[S] = [ES](K_{M} + [S])$$\n$$[ES] = \\frac{[E]_{\\text{tot}}[S]}{K_{M} + [S]}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $[ES]$ back into the initial rate equation, $v_0 = k_{\\text{cat}} [ES]$:\n$$v_{0} = k_{\\text{cat}} \\frac{[E]_{\\text{tot}}[S]}{K_{M} + [S]}$$\nThis is the Michaelis-Menten equation, representing the initial rate as a function of $k_{\\text{cat}}$, $K_{M}$, $[E]_{\\text{tot}}$, and $[S]$, which completes the first task.

In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor binds reversibly to the free enzyme active site, competing with the substrate. This type of inhibition increases the apparent Michaelis constant, $K_{M}^{\\text{app}}$, but does not affect the maximal velocity, $V_{\\text{max}}$, because at sufficiently high substrate concentrations, the substrate outcompetes the inhibitor.\n\nThe rate equation in the presence of a competitive inhibitor is thus:\n$$v_{0}^{\\text{(inh)}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{max}}[S]}{K_{M}^{\\text{app}} + [S]} = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}} [E]_{\\text{tot}} [S]}{K_{M}^{\\text{app}} + [S]}$$\n\nThe problem states that the inhibitor concentration is such that it \"doubles the apparent Michaelis constant\".
