The role of potassium efflux in NLRP3 inflammasome activation is a central and well-documented concept. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary conditions and definitions to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The parameters provided ($T=310$ K, ion concentrations) are physiologically realistic. The assumptions, such as the ideal dilute solution approximation and the constancy of intracellular pH, are standard for constructing a tractable biophysical model of this nature.

It is established on the fundamental principles of enzyme kinetics and provides a complete, consistent set of data and conditions. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a multi-step analysis grounded in Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics.\n\nFirst, we derive the Michaelis-Menten representation for the initial reaction rate, $v_0$. The reaction follows the scheme:\n$$ E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_2}{\\rightarrow} E + P $$\nwhere $E$ is the enzyme (caspase-1, CASP1), $S$ is the substrate (pro-IL-1β), $ES$ is the enzyme-substrate complex, and $P$ is the product (mature IL-1β).\n\nThe rate of product formation is given by:\n$$ v = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_2 [ES] $$\nThe rate of change of the enzyme-substrate complex concentration, $[ES]$, is:\n$$ \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_1 [E][S] - k_{-1}[ES] - k_2[ES] $$\nThe quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA) posits that for a significant portion of the reaction, the concentration of the intermediate complex $[ES]$ is approximately constant, i.e., $\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} \\approx 0$.\n$$ k_1 [E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\nThe total enzyme concentration, $[E]_T$, is constant: $[E]_T = [E] + [ES]$. Therefore, the free enzyme concentration is $[E] = [E]_T - [ES]$. Substituting this into the steady-state equation gives:\n$$ k_1 ([E]_T - [ES])[S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\nSolving for $[ES]$:\n$$ k_1 [E]_T [S] - k_1 [ES][S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\n$$ k_1 [E]_T [S] = (k_{-1} + k_2 + k_1 [S])[ES] $$\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{k_1 [E]_T [S]}{k_{-1} + k_2 + k_1 [S]} = \\frac{[E]_T [S]}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1} + [S]} $$\nWe define the Michaelis constant $K_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}$.

A noncompetitive inhibitor reduces the concentration of active enzyme without affecting substrate binding. This leads to a decrease in $V_{\\max}$ while $K_m$ remains unchanged. The problem states that the active CASP1 concentration is reduced to $50\\%$ of its original value. Since $V_{\\max}$ is directly proportional to the total active enzyme concentration ($V_{\\max} = k_2 [E]_T$), the new maximum velocity, $V'_{\\max}$, is:\n$$ V'_{\\max} = 0.5 \\cdot V_{\\max} = 0.5 \\cdot (2 \\text{ nM/s}) = 1 \\text{ nM/s} $$\nThe Michaelis constant remains the same: $K'_m = K_m = 100$ nM.\n\nFourth, we must calculate the product concentration $[P]$ at $t = 300$ s for the inhibited reaction, starting with $[S]_0 = 300$ nM. This requires the integrated form of the Michaelis-Menten equation.\nThe rate equation is $v = -\\frac{d[S]}{dt} = \\frac{V'_{\\max} [S]}{K'_m + [S]}$.\nWe separate variables to integrate:\n$$ -\\frac{K'_m + [S]}{[S]} d[S] = V'_{\\max} dt $$\n$$ -\\left(\\frac{K'_m}{[S]} + 1\\right) d[S] = V'_{\\max} dt $$\nIntegrating from $t=0$ to $t$ and from $[S]=[S]_0$ to $[S]=[S](t)$:\n$$ \\int_{[S]_0}^{[S](t)} -\\left(\\frac{K'_m}{[S]} + 1\\right) d[S] = \\int_0^t V'_{\\max} dt $$\n$$ -[K'_m \\ln[S] + [S]]_{[S]_0}^{[S](t)} = V'_{\\max} t $$\n$$ -(K'_m \\ln[S](t) + [S](t)) + (K'_m \\ln[S]_0 + [S]_0) = V'_{\\max} t $$\n$$ [S]_0 - [S](t) + K'_m \\ln\\left(\\frac{[S]_0}{[S](t)}\\right) = V'_{\\max} t $$\nFrom the reaction stoichiometry, the amount of substrate consumed equals the amount of product formed: $[S]_0 - [S](t) = [P](t)$.

They are defined as:\n$$\nK_{A} = \\frac{[E][A]}{[EA]}\n$$\n$$\nK_{i} = \\frac{[E][I]}{[EI]}\n$$\nThe fractional occupancy of the receptor by the agonist, $\\theta_{A}$, is the ratio of the concentration of agonist-bound receptor to the total receptor concentration $[E]_{T}$:\n$$\n\\theta_{A} = \\frac{[EA]}{[E]_{T}} = \\frac{[EA]}{[E] + [EA] + [EI]}\n$$\nUsing the equilibrium expressions, we can express $[EA]$ and $[EI]$ in terms of the free receptor concentration $[E]$:\n$$\n[EA] = \\frac{[E][A]}{K_{A}}\n$$\n$$\n[EI] = \\frac{[E][I]}{K_{i}}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the equation for $\\theta_{A}$:\n$$\n\\theta_{A} = \\frac{\\frac{[E][A]}{K_{A}}}{[E] + \\frac{[E][A]}{K_{A}} + \\frac{[E][I]}{K_{i}}}\n$$\nThe term for free receptor concentration, $[E]$, is common to all terms in the denominator and can be cancelled.\n$$\n\\theta_{A} = \\frac{\\frac{[A]}{K_{A}}}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{A}} + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}}\n$$\nTo obtain a more standard form, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $K_{A}$:\n$$\n\\theta_{A} = \\frac{[A]}{\\left(1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{A}} + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}\\right)K_{A}} = \\frac{[A]}{K_{A} + [A] + \\frac{K_{A}[I]}{K_{i}}}\n$$\nRearranging the denominator reveals the effect of the inhibitor on agonist binding:\n$$\n\\theta_{A} = \\frac{[A]}{[A] + K_{A}\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}\\right)}\n$$\nThis equation shows that in the presence of a competitive inhibitor, the agonist binds as if its dissociation constant were increased by a factor of $\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}\\right)$.\n\nThe problem states that the observed biological response $R$ is related to agonist concentration through a Hill function, which is a phenomenological model. The response in the absence of inhibitor is:\n$$\nR_{0}([A]) = \\frac{[A]^{n}}{\\operatorname{EC50}_{0}^{\\,n} + [A]^{n}}\n$$\nHere, $\\operatorname{EC50}_{0}$ is the agonist concentration that produces a half-maximal response. It is the functional analogue of the agonist's dissociation constant $K_{A}$. The problem assumes that the transductive mechanism mapping occupancy to response is unaltered by the inhibitor. Therefore, the effect of the competitive inhibitor on the dose-response curve is solely to modify the apparent potency of the agonist. We can thus replace $\\operatorname{EC50}_{0}$ with a new, inhibitor-dependent half-maximal effective concentration, $\\operatorname{EC50}([I])$, which is modified in exactly the same way as $K_{A}$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{EC50}([I]) = \\operatorname{EC50}_{0} \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the analytic expression for the inhibitor-dependent half-maximal concentration. The dose-response curve in the presence of inhibitor $[I]$ is then:\n$$\nR([A];[I]) = \\frac{[A]^{n}}{(\\operatorname{EC50}([I]))^{n} + [A]^{n}}\n$$\nThe fold-shift in the dose-response curve, denoted by the dose ratio $\\mathcal{D}([I])$, is defined as the ratio of the $\\operatorname{EC50}$ in the presence of the inhibitor to the $\\operatorname{EC50}$ in its absence:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}([I]) = \\frac{\\operatorname{EC50}([I])}{\\operatorname{EC50}_{0}}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\operatorname{EC50}([I])$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}([I]) = \\frac{\\operatorname{EC50}_{0} \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}\\right)}{\\operatorname{EC50}_{0}} = 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}\n$$\nThis relationship is a form of the Gaddum-Schild equation. Now, we must compute the numerical value of this dose ratio given the provided data: $K_{i} = 7.5\\,\\text{nM}$ and $[I] = 30\\,\\text{nM}$.\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}([I]) = 1 + \\frac{30\\,\\text{nM}}{7.5\\,\\text{nM}}\n$$\nThe units cancel, as is required for a unitless ratio.\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}([I]) = 1 + 4 = 5\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The exact integer result $5$ is written as $5.00$ to meet this specification.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.00}$$", "id": "2961130"}]}
