It is scientifically grounded in established principles of receptor-ligand kinetics and cell signaling, is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is formulated with objective, precise language. No flaws related to scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity are present.\n\nPart (a): Derivation of equilibrium receptor occupancy $\\theta$.\n\nWe are given the following definitions and relationships:\nThe dissociation constant:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\nThe conservation of total surface receptors:\n$$R_{T} = [R] + [RL]$$\nThe definition of receptor occupancy:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{R_{T}}$$\n\nOur objective is to express $\\theta$ as a function of the ligand concentration $[L]$ and the dissociation constant $K_{d}$. We begin by manipulating the equation for the conservation of receptors to express the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$, in terms of the total and bound receptors:\n$$[R] = R_{T} - [RL]$$\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the definition of the dissociation constant $K_{d}$:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{(R_{T} - [RL])[L]}{[RL]}$$\n\nWe now algebraically solve this equation for the concentration of the ligand-receptor complex, $[RL]$.\n$$K_{d} [RL] = (R_{T} - [RL])[L]$$\n$$K_{d} [RL] = R_{T}[L] - [RL][L]$$\n$$K_{d} [RL] + [RL][L] = R_{T}[L]$$\n$$[RL] (K_{d} + [L]) = R_{T}[L]$$\n$$[RL] = \\frac{R_{T}[L]}{K_{d} + [L]}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $[RL]$ into the definition of the occupancy, $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{R_{T}} = \\frac{1}{R_{T}} \\left( \\frac{R_{T}[L]}{K_{d} + [L]} \\right)$$\nThis simplifies to the desired expression for $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d} + [L]}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate $\\theta$ using the provided numerical values: $[L] = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and $K_{d} = 1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n$$\\theta = \\frac{5\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{1\\,\\mathrm{nM} + 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{5\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{6\\,\\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{5}{6}$$\n\nPart (b): Analysis of receptor trafficking dynamics.\n\nWe are asked to model the dynamics of the surface receptor population, $R_{s}(t)$, which is subject to first-order internalization (rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{int}}$) and recycling (rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{rec}}$). The total cellular receptor pool, $R_{T} = R_{s}(t) + R_{i}(t)$, where $R_{i}(t)$ is the internalized pool, is conserved.\n\nThe rate of change of the surface receptor population, $\\frac{dR_{s}}{dt}$, is determined by the balance between the rate of recycling of internalized receptors back to the surface and the rate of internalization of surface receptors. This is expressed by the following differential equation:\n$$\\frac{dR_{s}}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{rec}} R_{i}(t) - k_{\\mathrm{int}} R_{s}(t)$$\n\nTo solve this equation, we must express it in terms of a single variable, $R_{s}(t)$. We use the conservation relation $R_{i}(t) = R_{T} - R_{s}(t)$ to substitute for $R_{i}(t)$:\n$$\\frac{dR_{s}}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{rec}}(R_{T} - R_{s}(t)) - k_{\\mathrm{int}} R_{s}(t)$$\n$$\\frac{dR_{s}}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{rec}}R_{T} - k_{\\mathrm{rec}}R_{s}(t) - k_{\\mathrm{int}} R_{s}(t)$$\n$$\\frac{dR_{s}}{dt} + (k_{\\mathrm{int}} + k_{\\mathrm{rec}})R_{s}(t) = k_{\\mathrm{rec}}R_{T}$$\n\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. The solution consists of a transient part and a steady-state part. The steady-state solution, $R_{s,ss}$, is found by setting $\\frac{dR_{s}}{dt} = 0$:\n$$(k_{\\mathrm{int}} + k_{\\mathrm{rec}})R_{s,ss} = k_{\\mathrm{rec}}R_{T}$$\n$$R_{s,ss} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{rec}}}{k_{\\mathrm{int}} + k_{\\mathrm{rec}}} R_{T}$$\n\nThe general solution is of the form $R_{s}(t) = C\\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{int}} + k_{\\mathrm{rec}})t) + R_{s,ss}$. We determine the constant $C$ using the initial condition $R_{s}(0) = R_{T}$:\n$$R_{s}(0) = R_{T} = C + R_{s,ss} = C + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{rec}}}{k_{\\mathrm{int}} + k_{\\mathrm{rec}}} R_{T}$$\n$$C = R_{T} - \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{rec}}}{k_{\\mathrm{int}} + k_{\\mathrm{rec}}} R_{T} = R_{T}\\left(1 - \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{rec}}}{k_{\\mathrm{int}} + k_{\\mathrm{rec}}}\\right) = R_{T}\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{int}} + k_{\\mathrm{rec}} - k_{\\mathrm{rec}}}{k_{\\mathrm{int}} + k_{\\mathrm{rec}}}\\right) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{int}}}{k_{\\mathrm{int}} + k_{\\mathrm{rec}}} R_{T}$$\n\nSubstituting $C$ back into the general solution gives the explicit time-dependent expression for the surface receptor population:\n$$R_{s}(t) = \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{int}}}{k_{\\mathrm{int}} + k_{\\mathrm{rec}}} R_{T}\\right) \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{int}} + k_{\\mathrm{rec}})t) + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{rec}}}{k_{\\mathrm{int}} + k_{\\mathrm{rec}}} R_{T}$$\n\nThe signaling competence is given as $S(t) \\propto \\theta \\frac{R_{s}(t)}{R_{T}}$. Since $[L]$ is constant, $\\theta$ is also constant. Therefore, the time course of signaling, $S(t)$, is directly proportional to the fraction of receptors on the surface, $\\frac{R_{s}(t)}{R_{T}}$.\n\nQualitatively, increasing the internalization rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{int}}$ relative to the recycling rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ has two primary effects on the dynamics of $R_{s}(t)$:\n1.  The rate of decay from the initial state ($R_{s}(0) = R_{T}$) to the steady state ($R_{s,ss}$) is determined by the exponential term $\\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{int}} + k_{\\mathrm{rec}})t)$. A larger $k_{\\mathrm{int}}$ leads to a larger value for the overall rate constant $(k_{\\mathrm{int}} + k_{\\mathrm{rec}})$, which means the system approaches its steady state more rapidly. This shortens the time interval during which $R_{s}(t)$ remains close to its initial maximum value, $R_{T}$.\n2.  The steady-state level of surface receptors, $R_{s,ss} = R_{T} \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{rec}}}{k_{\\mathrm{int}} + k_{\\mathrm{rec}}} = R_{T} \\frac{1}{1 + k_{\\mathrm{int}}/k_{\\mathrm{rec}}}$, is reduced. As the ratio $k_{\\mathrm{int}}/k_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ increases, the steady-state fraction of surface receptors decreases, leading to a lower sustained signaling level.\n\nIn conclusion, increasing $k_{\\mathrm{int}}$ relative to $k_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ causes a more rapid depletion of surface receptors to a lower steady-state level. This results in a more transient signaling response, characterized by a shorter duration over which the signal $S(t)$ remains near its initial peak value.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{5}{6}}$$", "id": "2941050"}, {"introduction": "While receptor kinetics describe how a single cell \"sees\" a morphogen, in a three-dimensional organoid, the concentration a cell experiences is determined by its position within the tissue.
