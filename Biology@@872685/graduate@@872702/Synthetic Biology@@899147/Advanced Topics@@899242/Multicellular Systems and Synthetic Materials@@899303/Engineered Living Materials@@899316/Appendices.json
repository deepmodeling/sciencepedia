These bacteria are designed to produce a therapeutic protein, $P$, in response to an external chemical inducer, $I$. The synthesis of $P$ is governed by a simple inducible gene circuit.\n\nThe gene encoding for protein $P$ is regulated by a repressor. In the absence of the inducer $I$, the repressor binds to the DNA and blocks transcription. The inducer molecule $I$ can bind to the repressor, inactivating it and causing it to detach from the DNA. This derepression allows for the transcription of messenger RNA ($M$), which is then translated into the protein $P$.\n\nThe dynamic behavior of the concentrations of mRNA, $[M]$, and protein, $[P]$, can be modeled by the following system of differential equations:\n1.  The rate of transcription of mRNA is described by a Hill function, which models the cooperative binding of the inducer to the repressor. The maximal transcription rate is $\\alpha_M$.\n2.  The translation of mRNA into protein $P$ occurs at a rate proportional to the mRNA concentration, with a rate constant $\\alpha_P$.\n3.  Both mRNA and protein $P$ undergo first-order degradation, with rate constants $\\delta_M$ and $\\delta_P$, respectively.\n\nThe concentration of the inducer, $[I]$, is maintained at a constant level within the hydrogel. The relationship for the transcription rate as a function of inducer concentration is given by:\n$$\n\\text{Transcription Rate} = \\alpha_M \\frac{[I]^n}{K_I^n + [I]^n}\n$$\nwhere $K_I$ is the effective dissociation constant (the inducer concentration at which transcription is at half-maximum), and $n$ is the Hill coefficient for the inducer-repressor interaction.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the steady-state rate of synthesis of the protein $P$.", "solution": "1.
