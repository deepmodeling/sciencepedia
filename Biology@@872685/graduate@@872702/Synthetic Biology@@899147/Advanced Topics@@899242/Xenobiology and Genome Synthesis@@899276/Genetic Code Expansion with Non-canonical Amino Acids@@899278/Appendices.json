The scenario described is a standard problem in the field of genetic code expansion. The kinetic parameters and concentrations are within physically realistic and experimentally observed ranges. The statement is well-posed, providing all necessary information and assumptions to reach a conclusion. The critical assumption that the enzyme is unsaturated ($[S] \\ll K_M$) simplifies the kinetic analysis and makes the problem solvable with the given data, as it dictates the relevant kinetic parameter for determining specificity. The problem is objective and contains no logical contradictions or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A quantitative solution can be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, $v$, is described by the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$v = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}[E_0][S]}{K_M + [S]}$$\nwhere $[E_0]$ is the total enzyme concentration, $[S]$ is the substrate concentration, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ is the turnover number, and $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant.\n\nThe problem explicitly states that the enzyme is not saturated by any of its amino acid substrates. This corresponds to the kinetic regime where $[S] \\ll K_M$. Under this condition, the Michaelis-Menten equation simplifies to a second-order rate equation:\n$$v \\approx \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}[E_0][S]}{K_M} = \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_M}\\right) [E_0] [S]$$\nThe term $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_M$ is the specificity constant, which measures the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme for a given substrate at low concentrations.\n\nWe can now compare the rate of correct charging with the ncAA, $v_{\\mathrm{ncAA}}$, to the total rate of mischarging with all $20$ competing canonical amino acids, $v_{\\mathrm{mischarge}}$.\n\nThe rate of correct charging is:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{ncAA}} = \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_{\\mathrm{ncAA}} [E_0] [\\mathrm{ncAA}]$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{ncAA}} = (5 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}) [E_0] (1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{M}) = 500 [E_0] \\text{ s}^{-1}$$\n\nThe total rate of mischarging is the sum of the rates for each of the $20$ canonical amino acids:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{mischarge}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{20} \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_{\\mathrm{cAA},i} [E_0] [\\mathrm{cAA}_i]$$\nWe are given an upper bound for the specificity constant for any cAA, $(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_M)_{\\mathrm{cAA}}  10^{2} \\, \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}$, and the total concentration of cAAs, $\\sum [\\mathrm{cAA}_i] \\approx 10^{-2}$ M. To assess the worst-case scenario for fidelity, we use the upper bound for the mischarging specificity constant for all cAAs. This leads to an upper bound on the total mischarging rate:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{mischarge}}  [E_0] \\sum_{i=1}^{20} (10^{2} \\, \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}) [\\mathrm{cAA}_i]$$\n$$v_{\\mathrm{mischarge}}  (10^{2} \\, \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}) [E_0] \\sum_{i=1}^{20} [\\mathrm{cAA}_i]$$\n$$v_{\\mathrm{mischarge}}  (10^{2} \\, \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}) [E_0] (1 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\text{M}) = 1 [E_0] \\text{ s}^{-1}$$\n\nThe fidelity of tRNA charging is the fraction of charging events that are correct. This is given by the ratio of the correct charging rate to the total charging rate ($v_{\\mathrm{total}} = v_{\\mathrm{ncAA}} + v_{\\mathrm{mischarge}}$).\n$$\\text{Fidelity} = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{ncAA}}}{v_{\\mathrm{ncAA}} + v_{\\mathrm{mischarge}}}$$\nUsing our calculated values:\n$$\\text{Fidelity} \\approx \\frac{500 [E_0]}{500 [E_0] + 1 [E_0]} = \\frac{500}{501} \\approx 0.998$$\nThis translates to a charging fidelity of approximately $99.8\\%$. This is a high degree of specificity.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Yes. Under the stated concentrations, the engineered aaRS will charge the orthogonal tRNA with the ncAA in $99\\%$ of charging events, so amino acid-level orthogonality is sufficient; additional post-transfer editing would not materially change the outcome.**\nOur calculation demonstrates that the fidelity is approximately $99.8\\%$, which is indeed greater than $99\\%$. A fidelity this high is generally considered sufficient for many in vivo applications of genetic code expansion. The statement that post-transfer editing would not \"materially\" change the outcome is a reasonable judgment, as the system already performs with high precision. This statement is fully supported by the kinetic analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. No. Because the $20$ canonical amino acids sum to about $10$ mM, they will dominate enzyme encounters unless the ncAA reaction is diffusion-limited (on the order of $\\ge 10^{8} \\, \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}$), which it is not, so mischarging will be prevalent.**\nThis statement incorrectly concludes that the higher total concentration of canonical amino acids ($10$ mM) compared to the ncAA ($1$ mM) guarantees prevalent mischarging. It ignores the crucial role of the specificity constant, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_M$. The rate of reaction is proportional to the product of the specificity constant and the substrate concentration. The ratio of the overall rate of correct charging to mischarging is approximately $500:1$ in favor of the ncAA. Therefore, mischarging is rare, not prevalent. The reference to the diffusion limit is misleading; while a diffusion-limited rate would improve specificity, it is not a prerequisite for achieving high fidelity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. No. Without an explicit post-transfer editing domain, misactivated canonical amino acids will be transferred at high frequency irrespective of the measured specificity constants, so amino acid-level orthogonality is insufficient.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The specificity constant $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_M$ is precisely the parameter that quantifies the overall efficiency of an enzyme in converting a substrate to a product. It intrinsically accounts for all steps in the catalytic cycle, including substrate binding, any pre-transfer proofreading, chemical transfer ($k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$), and product release. To state that selectivity is \"irrespective of the measured specificity constants\" is a contradiction of basic enzyme kinetics. High specificity can be achieved without a post-transfer editing domain if the active site has very poor affinity ($K_M$) or catalytic activity ($k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$) for non-cognate substrates. The given data, $(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_M)_{\\mathrm{cAA}}  10^{2} \\, \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}$, reflects this poor efficiency for canonical amino acids.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Inconclusive. Separate knowledge of $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ and $K_M$ is required; the ratio $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_M$ alone cannot inform selectivity in cells even when the enzyme is unsaturated by substrates.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The condition that the enzyme is unsaturated ($[S] \\ll K_M$) is precisely the scenario where the specificity constant, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_M$, is the sole determinant of kinetic preference between competing substrates. The ratio of reaction rates for two substrates $S_1$ and $S_2$ simplifies to $\\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \\frac{(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_M)_1 [S_1]}{(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_M)_2 [S_2]}$. There is no need for separate values of $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ and $K_M$ under this specified condition.

The group observes a significant drop in the ncAA incorporation efficiency when the target protein's gene is moved from a low-copy to a high-copy plasmid. This suggests that the high load of target messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts titrates out the limited pool of ncAA-incorporation machinery.\n\nTo quantify this \"sponge\" effect, consider a simplified kinetic model of the cell. The total cellular concentration of the orthogonal suppressor tRNA, $[T_{total}]$, is constant. The orthogonal aaRS charges the uncharged tRNA with the ncAA at a rate that can be modeled as a first-order process with an effective rate constant $k_{charge}$. The resulting acylated (charged) suppressor tRNA, $[T^*]$, is consumed during translation. This consumption happens at two main sites: the UAG codons on the target gene's mRNA and the natural UAG stop codons of endogenous *E. coli* genes. The total rate of consumption of $[T^*]$ through endogenous gene translation can be modeled with an effective first-order rate constant $k_{endo}$. The rate of consumption of $[T^*]$ due to translation of the target gene is proportional to the plasmid copy number, $C$, and can be described by an effective rate constant $k_{target}$ per plasmid copy.\n\nGiven the following parameters for a strain harboring a high-copy plasmid:\n- Total cellular concentration of orthogonal suppressor tRNA, $[T_{total}] = 2.0$ µM\n- Effective first-order rate constant for tRNA charging, $k_{charge} = 5.0$ s⁻¹\n- Effective first-order rate constant for consumption by endogenous genes, $k_{endo} = 1.0$ s⁻¹\n- Effective first-order rate constant for consumption per target plasmid copy, $k_{target} = 0.20$ s⁻¹\n- Plasmid copy number, $C_{high} = 300$\n\nCalculate the steady-state concentration of the acylated suppressor tRNA, $[T^*]$.

This total number is the sum of the new amino acids encoded by repurposed triplet codons and those encoded by the new quadruplet codons.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the contribution from the repurposed triplet codons. The canonical genetic code contains $4^3 = 64$ total triplet codons. The problem states that the $3$ canonical stop codons are fully repurposed. Each of these $3$ codons is assigned to a distinct non-canonical amino acid. Therefore, the number of additional amino acids from this source is precisely $3$.\n$$ N_{\\text{triplet\\_additional}} = 3 $$\n\nNext, we analyze the contribution from the quadruplet codons. The number of possible quadruplet codons that can be formed from $4$ distinct nucleotides is given by the rule of product, where each of the $4$ positions can be one of $4$ bases.\n$$ N_{\\text{quadruplet\\_total}} = 4^4 = 256 $$\nThe problem specifies that of these $256$ quadruplet codons, exactly $1$ is reserved as a dedicated start signal and exactly $1$ is reserved as a dedicated stop signal for the quadruplet decoding system. These two codons are non-coding in the sense that they do not specify an amino acid to be incorporated into the polypeptide chain. The number of quadruplet codons available for encoding amino acids is therefore:\n$$ N_{\\text{quadruplet\\_coding}} = N_{\\text{quadruplet\\_total}} - N_{\\text{start}} - N_{\\text{stop}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ N_{\\text{quadruplet\\_coding}} = 256 - 1 - 1 = 254 $$\nThe problem further states that each of these available quadruplet codons can be assigned uniquely to a distinct non-canonical amino acid. This means there is a one-to-one mapping between the available codons and the new amino acids. Thus, the number of additional amino acids that can be encoded by the quadruplet system is $254$.\n$$ N_{\\text{quadruplet\\_additional}} = 254 $$\n\nThe total theoretical maximum number of additional amino acids, $N_{\\text{total\\_additional}}$, is the sum of the contributions from both the triplet and quadruplet systems.\n$$ N_{\\text{total\\_additional}} = N_{\\text{triplet\\_additional}} + N_{\\text{quadruplet\\_additional}} $$\n$$ N_{\\text{total\\_additional}} = 3 + 254 = 257 $$\nThis is the theoretical upper bound under the idealized conditions specified.\n\nThe problem also requires a discussion of practical factors that would reduce the realizable number. The theoretical maximum of $257$ new amino acids is a purely combinatorial result and is unattainable in any practical biological system for several fundamental reasons.\n\n1.  **Orthogonality of Translation Machinery**: The creation of $257$ new, mutually orthogonal aminoacyl–tRNA synthetase (aaRS)/tRNA pairs is the primary bottleneck. Each new aaRS must uniquely recognize its cognate non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) and its cognate tRNA, while exhibiting zero cross-reactivity with any of the endogenous $20$ amino acids, endogenous tRNAs, endogenous aaRSs, or the other $256$ engineered systems. The protein engineering challenge to evolve such a vast and perfectly orthogonal set is monumental and far beyond current capabilities.\n\n2.  **Ribosomal Competence**: The ribosome's peptidyl transferase center (PTC) must be able to accommodate and catalyze peptide bond formation with $257$ different non-canonical side chains. Many ncAAs may be too bulky, too reactive, or possess conformations that sterically hinder their entry into the A-site or their subsequent catalysis within the PTC, drastically reducing or inhibiting incorporation efficiency.\n\n3.  **Decoding Fidelity and Efficiency**: Quadruplet decoding is inherently inefficient compared to triplet decoding. The ribosome has a strong intrinsic preference for a $3$-base translocation step. This can lead to ribosomal frameshifting, where a quadruplet codon is read as a triplet, destroying the integrity of the translated protein. Maintaining high fidelity across $254$ distinct quadruplet codons without significant frameshifting or mis-incorporation is not feasible. The efficiency of incorporation would likely vary dramatically among different ncAAs and their corresponding tRNAs.\n\n4.  **Metabolic Burden and Resource Allocation**: Expressing $257$ additional aaRS/tRNA pairs would place an enormous metabolic load on the cell-free system or a host cell, depleting resources (ATP, nucleotides, amino acids) required for essential processes. Furthermore, the synthesis and supply of $257$ distinct, purified ncAAs in sufficient concentrations for efficient translation is a formidable logistical and chemical synthesis challenge. Many ncAAs may be unstable, insoluble under physiological conditions, or cytotoxic.\n\nIn summary, while the theoretical calculation is straightforward, the practical realization is limited by the immense complexity of engineering orthogonal biological components, the physical constraints of the ribosome, and the metabolic and chemical logistics of supporting such a vastly expanded genetic code.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{257}$$", "id": "2581040"}]}
