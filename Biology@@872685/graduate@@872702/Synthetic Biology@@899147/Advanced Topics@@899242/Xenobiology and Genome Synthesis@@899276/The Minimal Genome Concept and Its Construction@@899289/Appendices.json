By translating biological requirements like functional coverage, dependencies, and incompatibilities into a precise mathematical blueprint, you will learn to construct an integer linear program that defines an optimal minimal genome.", "problem": "In synthetic minimal genome design, the guiding starting point is the Central Dogma of molecular biology: genes encode functional products through Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) transcription to Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) and translation into protein, and a viable cell must encode modules that realize essential functions such as DNA replication, transcription, translation, and core metabolism. Consider an abstraction in which a finite set of functional requirements $\\mathcal{F}$ must be satisfied, and a library of candidate genetic modules $\\mathcal{M}$ is available. Each module $i \\in \\mathcal{M}$ has a DNA length $l_i$ measured in kilobase pairs (kbp) and covers a subset $S_i \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}$ of functions due to the activities of its expressed gene products. Selecting a subset of modules assembles a genome. The minimal genome problem is posed as selecting a subset of modules that covers each required function at least a specified redundancy level, while minimizing total genome length, and respecting biological constraints such as dependencies and incompatibilities.\n\nFormulate this minimal genome design as a combinatorial optimization problem using the following primitives:\n\n- Decision variables: for each module $i \\in \\mathcal{M}$, choose a binary decision $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ indicating whether module $i$ is included.\n- Objective: minimize $\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{M}} l_i x_i$.\n- Coverage constraints: for each function $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ with required redundancy $r_f \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$, enforce $\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{M}: f \\in S_i} x_i \\ge r_f$.\n- Dependency constraints: if module $j$ requires module $k$, enforce $x_j \\le x_k$; more generally, if module $j$ requires at least one among a set $\\mathcal{A}$, enforce $x_j \\le \\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} x_a$.\n- Incompatibility constraints: if modules $p$ and $q$ are mutually incompatible, enforce $x_p + x_q \\le 1$.\n\nNow consider the specific instance below.

It is formulated as an integer linear program (ILP). I will first validate the problem statement and then proceed to its solution.\n\nFirst, a validation of the problem statement is required.\n\nThe givens are as follows:\n- A set of functional requirements $\\mathcal{F}=\\{\\text{DNA replication }(R), \\text{ transcription }(T), \\text{ translation }(L), \\text{ phospholipid synthesis }(P), \\text{ nucleotide synthesis }(N), \\text{ amino acid synthesis }(A), \\text{ membrane transport }(M), \\text{ energy metabolism }(E)\\}$.\n- A uniform redundancy requirement $r_f = 1$ for all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$.\n- A set of $13$ candidate modules $\\mathcal{M}=\\{m_1, \\dots, m_{13}\\}$.\n- For each module $m_i$, a length $l_i$ (in kbp) and a set of covered functions $S_i$:\n  - $m_1$: $S_1=\\{R\\}, l_1=5.0$.\n  - $m_2$: $S_2=\\{T\\}, l_2=4.0$.\n  - $m_3$: $S_3=\\{L\\}, l_3=12.0$.\n  - $m_4$: $S_4=\\{P\\}, l_4=6.0$.\n  - $m_5$: $S_5=\\{N\\}, l_5=7.0$.\n  - $m_6$: $S_6=\\{A\\}, l_6=8.0$.\n  - $m_7$: $S_7=\\{M\\}, l_7=3.0$.\n  - $m_8$: $S_8=\\{E\\}, l_8=5.0$.\n  - $m_9$: $S_9=\\{E\\}, l_9=4.2$.\n  - $m_{10}$: $S_{10}=\\{N,A\\}, l_{10}=13.5$.\n  - $m_{11}$: $S_{11}=\\{M\\}, l_{11}=2.6$.\n  - $m_{12}$: $S_{12}=\\{N\\}, l_{12}=4.5$.\n  - $m_{13}$: $S_{13}=\\{R,T\\}, l_{13}=7.9$.\n- Binary decision variables $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for each module $m_i$.\n- An objective function to minimize total genome length: $\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{M}} l_i x_i$.\n- A set of biological constraints:\n  - $x_9 \\le x_7$\n  - $x_{10} \\le x_4$\n  - $x_{12} \\le x_7 + x_{11}$\n  - $x_9 + x_{11} \\le 1$\n  - $x_{13} + x_1 \\le 1$\n  - $x_{13} + x_2 \\le 1$\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, representing a simplified but valid abstraction of the minimal genome design challenge in synthetic biology. The functions listed are indeed essential for cellular life, and the constraints model plausible biological dependencies and incompatibilities. The problem is well-posed; it is a standard integer linear programming formulation with a finite number of variables and constraints, for which an optimal solution is guaranteed to exist. The language is objective and precise, and the provided data are complete and consistent. No scientific principles are violated. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe task is twofold: first, to state the specific integer linear program, and second, to solve it.\n\nPart 1: Integer Linear Programming Formulation\n\nDecision Variables:\nFor a set of modules $\\mathcal{M}=\\{m_1, \\dots, m_{13}\\}$, we define binary decision variables $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ for each $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 13\\}$, where $x_i=1$ if module $m_i$ is selected for the genome, and $x_i=0$ otherwise.\n\nObjective Function:\nMinimize the total genome length $L_{total}$, which is the sum of the lengths of the selected modules:\n$$ \\text{Minimize } L_{total} = 5.0x_1 + 4.0x_2 + 12.0x_3 + 6.0x_4 + 7.0x_5 + 8.0x_6 + 3.0x_7 + 5.0x_8 + 4.2x_9 + 13.5x_{10} + 2.6x_{11} + 4.5x_{12} + 7.9x_{13} $$\n\nConstraints:\nThe solution must satisfy the following constraints.\n\nCoverage Constraints (for each function $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$, with redundancy $r_f=1$):\n- Function $R$ (DNA replication): $x_1 + x_{13} \\ge 1$\n- Function $T$ (transcription): $x_2 + x_{13} \\ge 1$\n- Function $L$ (translation): $x_3 \\ge 1$\n- Function $P$ (phospholipid synthesis): $x_4 \\ge 1$\n- Function $N$ (nucleotide synthesis): $x_5 + x_{10} + x_{12} \\ge 1$\n- Function $A$ (amino acid synthesis): $x_6 + x_{10} \\ge 1$\n- Function $M$ (membrane transport): $x_7 + x_{11} \\ge 1$\n- Function $E$ (energy metabolism): $x_8 + x_9 \\ge 1$\n\nBiological Constraints:\n- Dependency ($m_9$ requires $m_7$): $x_9 \\le x_7$\n- Dependency ($m_{10}$ requires $m_4$): $x_{10} \\le x_4$\n- Conditional dependency ($m_{12}$ requires $m_7$ or $m_{11}$): $x_{12} \\le x_7 + x_{11}$\n- Incompatibility ($m_9$ and $m_{11}$): $x_9 + x_{11} \\le 1$\n- Incompatibility ($m_{13}$ and $m_1$): $x_{13} + x_1 \\le 1$\n- Incompatibility ($m_{13}$ and $m_2$): $x_{13} + x_2 \\le 1$\n\nPart 2: Solution of the Optimization Problem\n\nWe solve the ILP by logical deduction.\n\n1.  Mandatory Modules: The coverage constraints for functions $L$ and $P$ are $x_3 \\ge 1$ and $x_4 \\ge 1$. Since $x_i$ are binary, this forces $x_3=1$ and $x_4=1$. Modules $m_3$ and $m_4$ must be included.\n    - This contributes $l_3 + l_4 = 12.0 + 6.0 = 18.0$ kbp to the total length.\n    - Since $x_4=1$, the dependency $x_{10} \\le x_4$ becomes $x_{10} \\le 1$, which is always true for a binary variable and thus provides no further restriction on $x_{10}$.\n\n2.  Coverage of Functions $R$ and $T$: These functions are covered by modules $\\{m_1, m_2, m_{13}\\}$. The constraints are $x_1 + x_{13} \\ge 1$ and $x_2 + x_{13} \\ge 1$, coupled with incompatibility constraints $x_{13} + x_1 \\le 1$ and $x_{13} + x_2 \\le 1$.\n    - Option A: Select $m_{13}$ ($x_{13}=1$). This immediately satisfies coverage for both $R$ and $T$. The incompatibility constraints imply $x_1=0$ and $x_2=0$. The cost is $l_{13} = 7.9$ kbp.\n    - Option B: Do not select $m_{13}$ ($x_{13}=0$). Coverage constraints require $x_1=1$ and $x_2=1$. The cost is $l_1 + l_2 = 5.0 + 4.0 = 9.0$ kbp.\n    - Option A is cheaper. As this choice does not negatively constrain other parts of the problem, we select $m_{13}$. So, $x_{13}=1, x_1=0, x_2=0$. The cumulative length is $18.0 + 7.9 = 25.9$ kbp.\n\n3.  Coverage of Remaining Functions $\\{M, E, N, A\\}$: We must cover these four functions by selecting from the remaining available modules $\\{m_5, m_6, m_7, m_8, m_9, m_{10}, m_{11}, m_{12}\\}$, while minimizing cost and satisfying all remaining constraints. The key interacting constraints are $x_9 \\le x_7$, $x_{12} \\le x_7 + x_{11}$, and $x_9 + x_{11} \\le 1$. The choice for function $M$ ($m_7$ or $m_{11}$) is pivotal.\n\n    - Case I: Select $m_{11}$ for function $M$ ($x_{11}=1, x_7=0$). The cost for $M$ is $l_{11}=2.6$.\n        - The incompatibility $x_9 + x_{11} \\le 1$ forces $x_9=0$.\n        - To cover function $E$ ($x_8 + x_9 \\ge 1$), we must select $m_8$ ($x_8=1$). Cost for $E$ is $l_8=5.0$.\n        - To cover functions $N$ and $A$, we can either use $m_{10}$ (cost $13.5$) or separate modules. For separate modules, we must use $m_6$ for $A$ (cost $l_6=8.0$) and the cheapest option for $N$. The options for $N$ are $m_5$ ($7.0$), $m_{10}$ ($13.5$), and $m_{12}$ ($4.5$). The cheapest is $m_{12}$. The dependency $x_{12} \\le x_7 + x_{11} \\implies x_{12} \\le 0+1=1$ is satisfied. So we take $m_6$ and $m_{12}$. Total cost for $N$ and $A$ is $l_6+l_{12}=8.0+4.5=12.5$. This is cheaper than $m_{10}$.\n        - Total cost for this case: $l_{11} + l_8 + l_6 + l_{12} = 2.6 + 5.0 + 8.0 + 4.5 = 20.1$ kbp.\n\n    - Case II: Select $m_7$ for function $M$ ($x_7=1, x_{11}=0$). The cost for $M$ is $l_7=3.0$.\n        - To cover function $E$ ($x_8 + x_9 \\ge 1$), we can choose between $m_8$ ($l_8=5.0$) and $m_9$ ($l_9=4.2$). Module $m_9$ is cheaper. Its dependency $x_9 \\le x_7$ is satisfied since $x_7=1$. So we select $m_9$ ($x_9=1, x_8=0$). Cost for $E$ is $l_9=4.2$.\n        - To cover functions $N$ and $A$, as in Case I, the cheapest option is to use separate modules $m_6$ (for $A$) and $m_{12}$ (for $N$). The dependency $x_{12} \\le x_7 + x_{11} \\implies x_{12} \\le 1+0=1$ is satisfied. The cost is $l_6+l_{12}=8.0+4.5=12.5$.\n        - Total cost for this case: $l_7 + l_9 + l_6 + l_{12} = 3.0 + 4.2 + 8.0 + 4.5 = 19.7$ kbp.\n\n    Comparing the two cases, Case II yields a lower cost for covering functions $\\{M, E, N, A\\}$.\n\n4.  Final Solution:\n    The optimal set of modules is the union of the choices from each step.\n    - Mandatory: $\\{m_3, m_4\\}$\n    - For $R, T$: $\\{m_{13}\\}$\n    - For $M, E, N, A$: $\\{m_7, m_9, m_6, m_{12}\\}$ (from Case II)\n    The complete set of selected modules is $\\{m_3, m_4, m_6, m_7, m_9, m_{12}, m_{13}\\}$.\n\n5.  Calculation of Minimal Total Length:\n    The total length is the sum of the lengths of the selected modules:\n    $L_{total} = l_3 + l_4 + l_6 + l_7 + l_9 + l_{12} + l_{13}$\n    $L_{total} = 12.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 3.0 + 4.2 + 4.5 + 7.9$\n    $L_{total} = 45.6$ kbp.\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $45.6$ has three significant figures. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $45.60$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{45.60}\n$$", "id": "2783543"}, {"introduction": "After creating a blueprint for a minimal genome, we need tools to analyze its predicted behavior, especially its metabolic capabilities.

The fundamental base is the steady-state mass balance of intracellular metabolites and the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology operationalized through Gene–Protein–Reaction (GPR) associations. The steady-state assumption imposes that the intracellular accumulation rate is zero, which yields a linear constraint system on reaction fluxes. Essentiality is defined operationally: a reaction or gene set is essential if constraining it to be inactive forces the optimal biomass production flux to be zero. Synthetic lethality refers to the case where two perturbations are jointly lethal although neither alone is lethal.\n\nYou are given a toy, but scientifically consistent, metabolic network with $m$ intracellular metabolites and $n$ reactions. The network is encoded by a stoichiometric matrix $S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$, lower and upper bounds on reaction fluxes $l \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $u \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and an objective vector $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ selecting a “biomass” reaction to be maximized.

A solution is interpreted as “zero growth” if the optimal objective value is less than or equal to a small numerical tolerance $\\varepsilon = 10^{-9}$; otherwise, it is “nonzero growth.” For reporting, round each optimal growth value to $6$ decimal places.\n\nYour program must compute the optimal growth $c^{\\top} v$ for each of the following test cases, in the exact order listed.

Percentages are not used.\n\nScientific realism notes: The steady-state constraint $S v = 0$ approximates intracellular homeostasis over timescales where metabolite pools are quasi-stationary. Exchange or source/sink reactions are represented as bounded fluxes with single-metabolite stoichiometry, which is standard practice in constraint-based reconstruction and analysis when external pools are not explicitly modeled.\n\nImplement the linear programs with a standard linear solver. Do not use shortcuts beyond the stated definitions.

It requires the solution of a series of linear programming problems to determine the optimal growth rate of a toy metabolic network under various genetic and reaction-level perturbations. The problem is scientifically grounded, mathematically consistent, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, it is deemed valid.\n\nThe core of FBA is the steady-state assumption, which posits that for all intracellular metabolites, the rate of production equals the rate of consumption. For a network with $m$ metabolites and $n$ reactions, characterized by a stoichiometric matrix $S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$, this is expressed as a system of linear equations:\n$$\nS v = 0\n$$\nwhere $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the vector of reaction fluxes.

The biological objective, typically biomass production, is represented by a linear objective function $c^{\\top} v$ to be maximized.

A reaction $i$ knockout is implemented by setting its bounds to zero: $l_i = u_i = 0$.\n\nGene knockouts are translated into reaction knockouts via Gene-Protein-Reaction (GPR) associations. The provided GPRs are given in disjunctive normal form (an \"OR of ANDs\"). A reaction is active if at least one of its boolean clauses is true. A clause (an AND-group of genes) is true if and only if all genes within it are present. Consequently, a reaction is inactivated if and only if every one of its clauses is falsified by the gene knockout set.\n\nThe GPR rules are:\n- Reaction $0$ (A\\_imp): $(\\text{gA1}) \\lor (\\text{gA2})$. This reaction is inactive if and only if both gA1 and gA2 are knocked out.\n- Reaction $1$ (B\\_imp): $(\\text{gB})$.

This reaction is inactive if gBiom is knocked out.\n- Reaction $3$ (A\\_to\\_B): $(\\text{gAToB1} \\land \\text{gAToB2})$. This reaction is inactive if gAToB1 or gAToB2 (or both) are knocked out.\n\nThe solution methodology for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Identify the set of knockout genes or reactions specified by the test case.\n2.  If the knockout is specified at the gene level, apply the GPR logic to determine the corresponding set of reactions to be inactivated.\n3.  For each inactivated reaction $i$, adjust its flux bounds to $l_i = 0$ and $u_i = 0$.\n4.  Construct the LP problem instance with the modified bounds.

Solve the LP to find the optimal objective value, which represents the maximal biomass flux.\n6.  The problem states that a predicted growth rate $z_{opt} \\le \\varepsilon$ (where $\\varepsilon = 10^{-9}$) is interpreted as \"zero growth\". However, the output must be the raw numerical value from the solver, rounded to $6$ decimal places.

This problem explores a classic experimental challenge in bacterial genetics: the polar effect, where disrupting one gene in an operon unintentionally silences downstream genes, leading to incorrect assignments of essentiality [@problem_id:2783583]. By critically evaluating various experimental designs, you will develop the reasoning skills needed to devise strategies that distinguish a gene's intrinsic function from artifacts of its genetic context, a crucial skill for validating any minimal genome design.", "problem": "In a bacterial minimal-genome construction project, essentiality is inferred by genome-wide loss-of-function screens combined with reconstruction of precise gene lesions. Consider a polycistronic operon with genes $g_1$, $g_2$, and $g_3$, where independent conditional expression experiments have established that $g_3$ encodes an essential function under the tested condition. A transposon-based screen (transposon insertion sequencing; Tn-seq) with an element that carries an internal bidirectional transcriptional terminator and a single outward-facing promoter revealed strong depletion of insertions across $g_1$, $g_2$, and $g_3$. The team suspects that polar effects are confounding gene-level essentiality calls. Polar effects arise in bacteria because a single promoter can drive a polycistronic messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), transcription by ribonucleic acid polymerase (RNAP) proceeds through downstream open reading frames, translation can be translationally coupled across adjacent coding sequences, and introduced elements such as transcriptional terminators or large insertions can reduce read-through transcription, destabilize the mRNA, or disrupt translation initiation of downstream genes.\n\nStarting from the Central Dogma (deoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid to protein), the definition of bacterial operons (single promoter driving a polycistronic mRNA), and the principles that (i) transcriptional termination reduces downstream transcript abundance, (ii) ribosome binding site accessibility and translational coupling govern downstream translation, and (iii) complementing an upstream gene in trans does not restore transcription through a disrupted operon, select all design features for follow-up experiments that, if implemented, would specifically minimize misattribution of function due to polar effects and allow accurate attribution of essentiality to $g_1$ and $g_2$.\n\nA. Engineer an in-frame, scarless internal deletion within $g_1$ that removes approximately $50\\%$ of its coding sequence while preserving the native intergenic region and ribosome binding site upstream of $g_2$, and, if an antibiotic resistance cassette must be used, choose a cassette lacking a transcriptional terminator and add a synthetic ribosome binding site immediately upstream of $g_2$ to maintain translation initiation.\n\nB. Refactor the operon by integrating an independent constitutive promoter immediately upstream of $g_2$ so that $g_2$ and $g_3$ are transcribed independently of $g_1$; then generate $g_1$ disruptions to assess viability when downstream expression is insulated.\n\nC. Use clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) to target the operon promoter, thereby reducing transcription of $g_1$, and complement $g_1$ in trans from a plasmid under its native promoter to distinguish $g_1$-specific essentiality from polar effects.\n\nD. In the screening library, use a transposon with a strong outward-facing promoter at one end and compare the fitness of sense-orientation versus antisense-orientation insertions within $g_1$; treat orientation-dependent rescue of downstream expression as evidence of polar effects and reclassify $g_1$ accordingly.\n\nE. Introduce a strong intrinsic transcriptional terminator immediately downstream of $g_1$ so that $g_2$ and $g_3$ no longer receive transcriptional read-through from the $g_1$ locus, thereby preventing polar effects.\n\nF. Supply $g_2$ and $g_3$ from an ectopic genomic locus under promoters tuned to match their native expression levels (e.g., by measuring messenger ribonucleic acid abundance and adjusting promoter and ribosome binding site strengths), then introduce an early frameshift in $g_1$ at its native locus and assay viability.\n\nSelect all that apply.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically valid. It presents a classic scenario in bacterial functional genomics where the essentiality of genes within a polycistronic operon is confounded by polar effects. The core task is to identify experimental designs that can distinguish the genuine essentiality of upstream genes ($g_1$, $g_2$) from the lethal consequences of disrupting the expression of a known essential downstream gene ($g_3$).\n\nThe central issue is a polar effect, where a genetic disruption in an upstream gene of an operon (e.g., $g_1$) prevents expression of downstream genes (e.g., $g_2$ and $g_3$). According to the Central Dogma (Deoxyribonucleic acid $\\rightarrow$ Ribonucleic acid $\\rightarrow$ Protein) and the structure of bacterial operons, a single promoter drives a polycistronic messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). The transposon used in the initial screen contained a transcriptional terminator, which, upon insertion into $g_1$ or $g_2$, prematurely stops transcription by Ribonucleic acid polymerase (RNAP). This prevents the synthesis of the portion of the mRNA encoding the essential protein from gene $g_3$, leading to cell death. This makes $g_1$ and $g_2$ appear essential. A successful experimental design must therefore disrupt the function of the $g_1$ or $g_2$ protein product while leaving the expression of $g_3$ intact.\n\nWe will now evaluate each proposed experimental design.\n\nA. Engineer an in-frame, scarless internal deletion within $g_1$ that removes approximately $50\\%$ of its coding sequence while preserving the native intergenic region and ribosome binding site upstream of $g_2$, and, if an antibiotic resistance cassette must be used, choose a cassette lacking a transcriptional terminator and add a synthetic ribosome binding site immediately upstream of $g_2$ to maintain translation initiation.\n\nThis option proposes two robust methods. First, an in-frame, scarless deletion within $g_1$ would produce a non-functional $g_1$ protein without altering the reading frame of the polycistronic transcript. This minimizes the chance of creating premature stop codons that could induce Rho-dependent termination or other forms of transcriptional polarity. By preserving the intergenic region and the ribosome binding site (RBS) for $g_2$, it aims to maintain normal transcription and translation of the downstream genes $g_2$ and $g_3$. This cleanly separates the function of the $g_1$ protein from the integrity of the operon's expression. Second, if a selection marker is required, using a cassette that lacks a transcriptional terminator is critical to allow transcriptional read-through, as stated in principle (i). The addition of a synthetic RBS upstream of $g_2$ is a sophisticated step that directly addresses potential translational polarity (disruption of translational coupling), as described in principle (ii). This ensures that translation of $g_2$ (and subsequently $g_3$) can re-initiate efficiently. Both strategies are designed to specifically test the essentiality of the $g_1$ protein while minimizing polar effects. **Correct**.\n\nB. Refactor the operon by integrating an independent constitutive promoter immediately upstream of $g_2$ so that $g_2$ and $g_3$ are transcribed independently of $g_1$; then generate $g_1$ disruptions to assess viability when downstream expression is insulated.\n\nThis strategy involves genetic refactoring to insulate the expression of the downstream genes from the upstream gene. By inserting a new promoter before $g_2$, a new transcriptional unit is created, making the expression of $g_2$ and $g_3$ entirely independent of the native operon promoter and the status of gene $g_1$. With the expression of the essential gene $g_3$ guaranteed by this new promoter, any method of disrupting $g_1$ (e.g., deletion, frameshift, or even transposon insertion) will no longer exert a fatal polar effect. The viability of the cell then directly and unambiguously reflects the essentiality of the $g_1$ gene product itself. This is a powerful and definitive method for dissecting operon function. **Correct**.\n\nC. Use clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) to target the operon promoter, thereby reducing transcription of $g_1$, and complement $g_1$ in trans from a plasmid under its native promoter to distinguish $g_1$-specific essentiality from polar effects.\n\nThis experimental design is fundamentally flawed. Using CRISPRi to target the single promoter of the operon will inhibit transcription of the *entire* operon, including $g_1$, $g_2$, and the essential gene $g_3$. This will lead to reduced levels of the essential $g_3$ protein, likely causing a severe fitness defect or lethality, regardless of whether $g_1$ is essential. Providing the $g_1$ gene product in trans (from a plasmid) cannot rescue a cell that is dying from a lack of the $g_3$ protein. This experiment does not decouple the knockdown of $g_1$ from the knockdown of $g_3$ and therefore fails to test the specific essentiality of $g_1$. It misunderstands the nature of the problem, and principle (iii) about trans-complementation not restoring transcription is relevant here in spirit—adding back the protein cannot fix a transcriptional defect on other genes. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. In the screening library, use a transposon with a strong outward-facing promoter at one end and compare the fitness of sense-orientation versus antisense-orientation insertions within $g_1$; treat orientation-dependent rescue of downstream expression as evidence of polar effects and reclassify $g_1$ accordingly.\n\nThis describes a sophisticated high-throughput screening method designed specifically to identify polar effects. A transposon with an outward-facing promoter can potentially rescue the expression of downstream genes if it inserts in the correct orientation. If an insertion occurs within $g_1$ in the \"sense\" orientation (i.e., the transposon's promoter is pointing towards $g_2$ and $g_3$), this promoter can drive transcription of the downstream genes, thus bypassing the transcriptional block caused by the insertion itself. If the transposon inserts in the \"antisense\" orientation, its promoter points away from the downstream genes, and the polar effect is not rescued. Therefore, if $g_1$ is non-essential but $g_3$ is, cells with sense-oriented insertions in $g_1$ will survive, while cells with antisense-oriented insertions will not. Observing this orientation-dependent fitness signature is strong evidence that the apparent essentiality of $g_1$ is an artifact of a polar effect on $g_3$. This allows for the correction of essentiality calls on a large scale. **Correct**.\n\nE. Introduce a strong intrinsic transcriptional terminator immediately downstream of $g_1$ so that $g_2$ and $g_3$ no longer receive transcriptional read-through from the $g_1$ locus, thereby preventing polar effects.\n\nThis proposal is illogical and counterproductive. Its action is the very definition of causing a transcriptional polar effect, not preventing one. Introducing a strong terminator after $g_1$ would ensure that RNAP terminates transcription before reaching $g_2$ and the essential gene $g_3$. This would abolish the expression of the essential $g_3$ protein from the native operon, leading to cell death. The stated goal of \"preventing polar effects\" is contradicted by the proposed mechanism. This experiment would engineer a lethal phenotype, providing no useful information about the essentiality of $g_1$ or $g_2$. **Incorrect**.\n\nF. Supply $g_2$ and $g_3$ from an ectopic genomic locus under promoters tuned to match their native expression levels (e.g., by measuring messenger ribonucleic acid abundance and adjusting promoter and ribosome binding site strengths), then introduce an early frameshift in $g_1$ at its native locus and assay viability.\n\nThis is an exemplary \"insulation and complementation\" strategy. By expressing $g_2$ and the essential gene $g_3$ from a separate, ectopic locus, the cell is rescued from any polar effects that might arise from disruptions at the native operon. With the downstream essential functions secured, the native $g_1$ gene can be cleanly inactivated, for instance by an early frameshift mutation, which is a reliable method to create a null allele. The survival of the resulting strain then depends solely on whether the $g_1$ protein itself is essential for viability. The mention of tuning expression levels is a mark of a well-controlled experiment, designed to avoid artifacts from improper gene dosage. This method provides an unambiguous test of $g_1$'s essentiality. **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDF}$$", "id": "2783583"}]}
