It is scientifically grounded in established principles of enzyme kinetics, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of data, and stated objectively. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the rate expression for product formation, starting from first principles, for a single-substrate enzymatic reaction under the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA). The elementary kinetic scheme is given by:\n$$ E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_2}{\\longrightarrow} E + P $$\nHere, $E$ represents the orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS), $S$ is the noncanonical amino acid (ncAA), $ES$ is the enzyme-substrate complex, and $P$ is the product, the ncAA-charged tRNA. The rate constants $k_1$, $k_{-1}$, and $k_2$ correspond to substrate binding, substrate dissociation, and the catalytic step, respectively. The problem states that the turnover number is $k_{\\text{cat}}$, which for this simple scheme is identical to $k_2$. Thus, $k_2 = k_{\\text{cat}}$.\n\nThe rate of product formation, or flux ($v$), is determined by the breakdown of the $ES$ complex into product:\n$$ v = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{\\text{cat}} [ES] $$\nTo find the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex, $[ES]$, we apply the quasi-steady-state approximation. This approximation assumes that the concentration of the intermediate complex $[ES]$ remains constant over the time course of the reaction, meaning its rate of formation is equal to its rate of consumption.\n$$ \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = (\\text{rate of formation of } ES) - (\\text{rate of consumption of } ES) \\approx 0 $$\n$$ k_1 [E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}})[ES] = 0 $$\nSolving for $[ES]$ yields:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{k_1 [E][S]}{k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}} $$\nThe total concentration of enzyme, $[E]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the free enzyme, $[E]$, and the enzyme bound in the complex, $[ES]$:\n$$ [E]_{\\text{total}} = [E] + [ES] \\implies [E] = [E]_{\\text{total}} - [ES] $$\nSubstituting this expression for the free enzyme concentration $[E]$ into the equation for $[ES]$:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{k_1 ([E]_{\\text{total}} - [ES])[S]}{k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}} $$\nWe rearrange to solve for $[ES]$:\n$$ [ES](k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}) = k_1 [E]_{\\text{total}}[S] - k_1[ES][S] $$\n$$ [ES]((k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}) + k_1[S]) = k_1[E]_{\\text{total}}[S] $$\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{k_1[E]_{\\text{total}}[S]}{(k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}) + k_1[S]} $$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $k_1$:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{[E]_{\\text{total}}[S]}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_1} + [S]} $$\nThe Michaelis constant, $K_M$, is defined as $K_M = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_1}$.

The rate is approximately first-order in $[S]$: $v \\approx \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}[E]_{\\text{total}}[S]$.\n2.  **Enzyme saturation** occurs when $[S] \\gg K_M$. The rate is maximal and zero-order in $[S]$: $v \\approx k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_{\\text{total}} = V_{\\text{max}}$.\n\nThe given values are:\n$$ [S] = 0.120 \\ \\text{mM} $$\n$$ K_M = 0.450 \\ \\text{mM} $$\nComparing these values, we find that $[S] < K_M$. Specifically, $[S] = \\frac{0.120}{0.450} K_M \\approx 0.267 K_M$.\nSince the substrate concentration is substantially lower than the Michaelis constant, the enzyme is operating far below its maximum capacity. We can quantify this by calculating the fractional saturation of the enzyme, which is the ratio of the actual velocity $v$ to the maximal velocity $V_{\\text{max}}$:\n$$ \\frac{v}{V_{\\text{max}}} = \\frac{[S]}{K_M + [S]} = \\frac{0.120}{0.450 + 0.120} = \\frac{0.120}{0.570} \\approx 0.211 $$\nThe reaction is proceeding at approximately $21\\%$ of its maximum possible rate. An enzyme is considered saturated when this ratio approaches $1$. A value of $0.211$ clearly indicates that the enzyme is not saturated. The rate of the reaction is highly dependent on the concentration of the substrate, $[S]$.\nTherefore, under these conditions, the charging reaction is dominated by **substrate limitation**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{687}$$", "id": "2756981"}, {"introduction": "An effective orthogonal pair must be a silent guest in the cell; it must perform its new function without disrupting the host's existing metabolic and genetic processes.

Let $m_h$ be the fractional misacylation of the host tRNA, $t_h$, and $m_o$ be that of the orthogonal tRNA, $t_o$.\n\nFor the host tRNA, $t_h$, the cognate enzyme is the host aaRS, $A_h$, and the noncognate enzyme is the orthogonal aaRS, $A_o$. The charging fluxes are proportional to $k_{j,i}E_j$. The fractional misacylation is the ratio of the noncognate flux to the sum of cognate and noncognate fluxes:\n$$\nm_h = \\frac{v_{o,h}}{v_{h,h} + v_{o,h}} = \\frac{k_{o,h} E_o}{k_{h,h} E_h + k_{o,h} E_o}\n$$\nThe proportionality constant related to the tRNA concentration cancels from the ratio.

The fractional misacylation is:\n$$\nm_o = \\frac{v_{h,o}}{v_{o,o} + v_{h,o}} = \\frac{k_{h,o} E_h}{k_{o,o} E_o + k_{h,o} E_h} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{k_{o,o} E_o}{k_{h,o} E_h} + 1}\n$$\n\nThe problem defines two cognate-to-noncognate flux ratios, which we denote as $R_h$ and $R_o$:\n$$\nR_h = \\frac{k_{h,h} E_h}{k_{o,h} E_o} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad R_o = \\frac{k_{o,o} E_o}{k_{h,o} E_h}\n$$\nThe misacylation fractions are thus compactly expressed as:\n$$\nm_h = \\frac{1}{R_h + 1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad m_o = \\frac{1}{R_o + 1}\n$$\n\nThe crosstalk criterion requires that both misacylation fractions be less than the tolerance $\\epsilon$:\n$$\nm_h < \\epsilon \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{1}{R_h + 1} < \\epsilon \\quad \\implies \\quad R_h + 1 > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\quad \\implies \\quad R_h > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1\n$$\n$$\nm_o < \\epsilon \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{1}{R_o + 1} < \\epsilon \\quad \\implies \\quad R_o + 1 > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\quad \\implies \\quad R_o > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1\n$$\nFor the system to be considered orthogonal, both conditions must be met. This requires that the lesser of the two ratios, $R_h$ and $R_o$, must exceed $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1$. The orthogonality score $S$ is defined as $S = \\min(R_h, R_o)$.

It is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear, quantitative criterion for evaluation. The language is objective and precise. The data provided are within realistic ranges for such biophysical systems. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and requires substantive application of scientific principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A quantitative solution can be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe objective is to determine which of the four designs (D1–D4) satisfy the misacylation constraint. The misacylation fraction, $f_{\\mathrm{mis}}$, is the fraction of acylation events involving natural amino acids (Tyr and Phe) relative to all acylation events (ncAA, Tyr, and Phe).\n\nUnder the assumption that the catalytic rate constant ($k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$) is independent of the amino acid substrate, the rate of acylation for a given amino acid $i$ is proportional to the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex, $[E \\cdot i]$. In a competitive binding scenario, the fractional occupancy of the enzyme's active site by ligand $i$ determines its contribution to the total product formation. From statistical mechanics, the probability of the enzyme being bound to ligand $i$ is proportional to the product of its concentration $c_i$ and its Boltzmann factor, $e^{-\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(i) / RT}$.\n\nThe total misacylation fraction $f_{\\mathrm{mis}}$ is the sum of the fractions for each competing natural amino acid, which can be expressed as:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{mis}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in \\{\\mathrm{Tyr}, \\mathrm{Phe}\\}} c_i e^{-\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(i) / RT}}{\\sum_{j \\in \\{\\mathrm{ncAA}, \\mathrm{Tyr}, \\mathrm{Phe}\\}} c_j e^{-\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(j) / RT}} $$\nThe condition for a design to be retained is $f_{\\mathrm{mis}} \\le \\alpha$, where $\\alpha = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the thermal energy term, $RT$.\nUsing the gas constant $R \\approx 1.987 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kcal \\cdot mol^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}}$ and the given temperature $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$ RT = (1.987 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kcal \\cdot mol^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}}) \\times (298\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.592\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mol} $$\n\nNow, we evaluate $f_{\\mathrm{mis}}$ for each design. Let the relative statistical weight of each ligand be $S_i = c_i e^{-\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(i) / RT}$. The concentrations can be used in $\\mathrm{mM}$ as they form ratios.\n\n**Design D1:**\n$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{ncAA}) = -9.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{Tyr}) = -5.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{Phe}) = -6.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$.\n$S_{\\mathrm{ncAA}} = 0.20 \\cdot e^{-(-9.0)/0.592} = 0.20 \\cdot e^{15.20} \\approx 8.00 \\times 10^5$.\n$S_{\\mathrm{Tyr}} = 0.50 \\cdot e^{-(-5.0)/0.592} = 0.50 \\cdot e^{8.45} \\approx 2.34 \\times 10^3$.\n$S_{\\mathrm{Phe}} = 0.50 \\cdot e^{-(-6.0)/0.592} = 0.50 \\cdot e^{10.14} \\approx 1.27 \\times 10^4$.\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{mis}}(\\mathrm{D1}) = \\frac{2.34 \\times 10^3 + 1.27 \\times 10^4}{8.00 \\times 10^5 + 2.34 \\times 10^3 + 1.27 \\times 10^4} = \\frac{1.50 \\times 10^4}{8.15 \\times 10^5} \\approx 1.84 \\times 10^{-2} $$\nSince $1.84 \\times 10^{-2} > 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$, design D1 is **rejected**.\n\n**Design D2:**\n$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{ncAA}) = -8.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{Tyr}) = -1.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{Phe}) = -2.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$.\n$S_{\\mathrm{ncAA}} = 0.20 \\cdot e^{-(-8.0)/0.592} = 0.20 \\cdot e^{13.51} \\approx 1.47 \\times 10^5$.\n$S_{\\mathrm{Tyr}} = 0.50 \\cdot e^{-(-1.0)/0.592} = 0.50 \\cdot e^{1.69} \\approx 2.7$.\n$S_{\\mathrm{Phe}} = 0.50 \\cdot e^{-(-2.0)/0.592} = 0.50 \\cdot e^{3.38} \\approx 14.7$.\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{mis}}(\\mathrm{D2}) = \\frac{2.7 + 14.7}{1.47 \\times 10^5 + 2.7 + 14.7} = \\frac{17.4}{147017.4} \\approx 1.18 \\times 10^{-4} $$\nSince $1.18 \\times 10^{-4} < 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$, design D2 is **retained**.\n\n**Design D3:**\n$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{ncAA}) = -10.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{Tyr}) = -6.5\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{Phe}) = -6.5\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$.\n$S_{\\mathrm{ncAA}} = 0.20 \\cdot e^{-(-10.0)/0.592} = 0.20 \\cdot e^{16.89} \\approx 4.33 \\times 10^6$.\n$S_{\\mathrm{Tyr}} = 0.50 \\cdot e^{-(-6.5)/0.592} = 0.50 \\cdot e^{10.98} \\approx 2.93 \\times 10^4$.\n$S_{\\mathrm{Phe}} = 0.50 \\cdot e^{-(-6.5)/0.592} = 0.50 \\cdot e^{10.98} \\approx 2.93 \\times 10^4$.\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{mis}}(\\mathrm{D3}) = \\frac{2.93 \\times 10^4 + 2.93 \\times 10^4}{4.33 \\times 10^6 + 2.93 \\times 10^4 + 2.93 \\times 10^4} = \\frac{5.86 \\times 10^4}{4.39 \\times 10^6} \\approx 1.33 \\times 10^{-2} $$\nSince $1.33 \\times 10^{-2} > 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$, design D3 is **rejected**.\n\n**Design D4:**\n$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{ncAA}) = -7.5\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{Tyr}) = -1.5\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{Phe}) = -4.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$.\n$S_{\\mathrm{ncAA}} = 0.20 \\cdot e^{-(-7.5)/0.592} = 0.20 \\cdot e^{12.67} \\approx 6.33 \\times 10^4$.\n$S_{\\mathrm{Tyr}} = 0.50 \\cdot e^{-(-1.5)/0.592} = 0.50 \\cdot e^{2.53} \\approx 6.3$.\n$S_{\\mathrm{Phe}} = 0.50 \\cdot e^{-(-4.0)/0.592} = 0.50 \\cdot e^{6.76} \\approx 4.28 \\times 10^2$.\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{mis}}(\\mathrm{D4}) = \\frac{6.3 + 428}{6.33 \\times 10^4 + 6.3 + 428} = \\frac{434.3}{63734.3} \\approx 6.82 \\times 10^{-3} $$\nSince $6.82 \\times 10^{-3} > 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$, design D4 is **rejected**.\n\nThe only retained design is D2.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nThe task requires selecting the option that both proposes a sound computational pipeline and correctly identifies the retained designs.\n\n**A.** The proposed pipeline is mechanistically and thermodynamically rigorous. It correctly accounts for protein flexibility (\"ensemble of... conformers,\" \"flexible... docking\"), uses a consistent physics-based energy function, and crucially respects the orthogonality constraint by keeping tRNA identity residues fixed. Most importantly, it employs the correct, physically-grounded filtering criterion based on thermodynamic competition, which explicitly includes ligand concentrations and temperature. The inclusion of checks for catalytic geometry and against host tRNAs further demonstrates its soundness. The predicted outcome, \"Retained designs under the stated conditions: D2 only,\" matches our independent calculation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** This pipeline is fundamentally flawed. It uses a \"single rigid... backbone,\" an oversimplification. It proposes to \"mutate all pocket residues including those that contact the tRNA,\" which fatally violates the orthogonality constraint. It uses inconsistent energy functions for the ncAA and natural amino acids. The filtering criterion, a simple $\\Delta G$ cutoff independent of concentration and temperature, is physically incorrect and arbitrary. The predicted outcome, \"D1 and D3,\" is inconsistent with the correct thermodynamic analysis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This pipeline is also flawed. It states \"Freeze no residues during design,\" which, like option B, violates the critical orthogonality constraint. The filtering criterion, requiring a fixed specificity gap ($\\Delta \\Delta G_{i} \\ge 4.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$) without regard to concentrations or temperature, is not based on first principles of competitive binding and is therefore incorrect. The predicted outcome, \"D1 and D3,\" is also inconsistent with our findings.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** While starting with a description similar to option A, this pipeline contains two severe errors. First, it proposes using $RT = 2.48\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$ for $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$. This value is numerically incorrect; the correct value is $RT \\approx 0.592\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$. The value $2.48$ corresponds to $RT$ in units of $\\mathrm{kJ/mol}$, and using it with $\\Delta G$ values in $\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$ demonstrates a fundamental dimensional inconsistency. Second, it states, \"Allow optimization of tRNA-contact residues,\" which again violates the core principle of preserving orthogonality. The predicted outcome, \"D4 only,\" is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nOnly option A describes a scientifically valid methodology and arrives at the correct conclusion based on the provided data.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2756999"}]}
