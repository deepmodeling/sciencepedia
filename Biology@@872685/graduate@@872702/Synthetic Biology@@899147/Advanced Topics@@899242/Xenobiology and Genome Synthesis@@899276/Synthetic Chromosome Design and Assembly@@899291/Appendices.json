The designed sequence must encode a fixed amino acid sequence while balancing three design pressures that affect viability, stability, and manufacturability. Let the design variable be the codon sequence $x$ constrained to use only synonymous codons for each amino acid in the target protein. Define three penalties:\n- Codon usage deviation $C(x)$, operationalized as the aggregated Kullback–Leibler divergence between the empirical synonymous codon distribution induced by $x$ and a target reference distribution $q$ for *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, i.e., for each amino acid $a$ with synonymous codon set $\\mathcal{C}_{a}$ and empirical frequencies $p_{a,c}(x)$, the contribution $\\sum_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}_{a}} p_{a,c}(x)\\ln\\!\\big(p_{a,c}(x)/q_{a,c}\\big)$ is summed over all amino acids present in the protein.\n- Repeat propensity $R(x)$, defined as a scalar penalty returned by a repeat-detection routine that increases with the expected count of exact repeats of length at least $k_{0}$ that can mediate homologous recombination or non-allelic homologous recombination during strain construction.\n- Synthesis ease penalty $S(x)$, defined as a scalar penalty that increases with violations of synthesis vendor constraints such as extreme windowed guanine-cytosine content, long homopolymer runs, and high-complexity secondary structure motifs that elevate de novo DNA synthesis failure rates.\n\nAssume multi-objective optimization will be scalarized into a single objective by a convex combination of these three penalties with nonnegative weights that sum to $1$.

For a fair comparison, we assume $n=6$ clones are also assayed for the haploid edit. The \"per-edit detection probability\" is the probability that at least one of the $n$ clones is a hit.\nThe probability of a single clone *not* being a hit is $1 - \\Phi(-1) \\approx 1 - 0.1587 = 0.8413$.\nThe probability of *none* of the $n=6$ clones being hits is $(1 - \\Phi(-1))^6$.\nThe per-edit detection probability is:\n$$P(\\text{detect}_{\\text{haploid}}) = 1 - (1 - \\Phi(-1))^n = 1 - (1 - 0.1587)^6 \\approx 1 - (0.8413)^6 \\approx 1 - 0.3548 = 0.6452$$\nThis value, $0.6452$, indeed exceeds $0.60$.\n\n**Diploid Strategy:**\nFor each of the $n=6$ clones, the edit is installed independently on two homologs with success probability $p=0.5$. The genotype of a clone can be:\n- Homozygous recessive: Both homologs edited. Probability $p^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25$. Here, $s=s_r=-0.02$.\n- Heterozygous: One homolog edited. Probability $2p(1-p) = 2(0.5)(0.5) = 0.5$. Here, $s \\approx h s_r \\approx 0$.\n- Homozygous wild-type: No homologs edited. Probability $(1-p)^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25$. Here, $s=0$.\nThe clones that are not homozygous recessive have a selection coefficient $s \\approx 0$. The probability of this is $1-p^2 = 0.75$.\n\nThe hit probability depends on the clone's genotype:\n- For a homozygous clone ($s=s_r$): $P(\\text{hit}|s=s_r) = \\Phi(-1) \\approx 0.1587$.\n- For a non-homozygous clone ($s=0$): $P(\\text{hit}|s=0) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{-\\tau - 0 \\cdot T}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{-1.2}{0.4}\\right) = \\Phi(-3) \\approx 0.00135$. This is the false positive rate.\n\nThe overall probability of a single random diploid clone being a hit is the weighted average:\n$$P(\\text{hit}_{\\text{diploid\\_clone}}) = p^2 \\cdot P(\\text{hit}|s=s_r) + (1-p^2) \\cdot P(\\text{hit}|s=0)$$\n$$P(\\text{hit}_{\\text{diploid\\_clone}}) \\approx 0.25 \\times 0.1587 + 0.75 \\times 0.00135 \\approx 0.039675 + 0.0010125 = 0.0406875$$\nThe per-edit detection probability is the probability of at least one hit among $n=6$ clones:\n$$P(\\text{detect}_{\\text{diploid}}) = 1 - (1 - P(\\text{hit}_{\\text{diploid\\_clone}}))^6 \\approx 1 - (1 - 0.0406875)^6 \\approx 1 - (0.9593125)^6 \\approx 1 - 0.7801 = 0.2199$$\nThis value is approximately $0.22$.\nBoth parts of the statement are consistent with our calculations.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B.

The approximation $P_{\\text{detect}} \\propto p^2$ requires that the per-clone hit probability is very small, allowing for the approximation $1-(1-x)^n \\approx nx$. Here, this approximation is not sufficiently accurate.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In the haploid strategy, doubling the assay duration from $T = 40$ to $T = 80$ generations will double the per-clone detection probability.**\n\nThe per-clone detection probability is a function of $T$:\n$$P_{\\text{clone}}(T) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{-\\tau - s_r T}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{-1.2 - (-0.02)T}{0.4}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{0.02T}{0.4} - \\frac{1.2}{0.4}\\right) = \\Phi(0.05T - 3)$$\nFor $T=40$:\n$$P_{\\text{clone}}(40) = \\Phi(0.05 \\times 40 - 3) = \\Phi(2-3) = \\Phi(-1) \\approx 0.1587$$\nFor $T=80$:\n$$P_{\\text{clone}}(80) = \\Phi(0.05 \\times 80 - 3) = \\Phi(4-3) = \\Phi(1)$$\nSince $\\Phi(z) = 1 - \\Phi(-z)$, we have $\\Phi(1) = 1 - \\Phi(-1) \\approx 1 - 0.1587 = 0.8413$.\nThe ratio of probabilities is $\\frac{P_{\\text{clone}}(80)}{P_{\\text{clone}}(40)} \\approx \\frac{0.8413}{0.1587} \\approx 5.3$. This is far from doubling. The relationship is highly non-linear due to the sigmoidal shape of the Gaussian CDF.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The masking of recessive deleterious edits in diploids follows directly from the definition of dominance: for dominance coefficient $h \\approx 0$, the heterozygote selection coefficient is $h s_r \\approx 0$, so pooled competition assays that infer effects from frequency shifts will have low power unless homozygotes are present at appreciable frequency.**\n\nThis is a conceptual statement. Let's analyze its components.\n1. `...masking of recessive deleterious edits in diploids follows directly from the definition of dominance: for dominance coefficient $h \\approx 0$, the heterozygote selection coefficient is $h s_r \\approx 0...` This is the standard definition of a recessive allele in population genetics. A heterozygote carrying one copy of the allele shows little to no fitness difference compared to the wild-type homozygote, thus \"masking\" the allele's effect. This part is correct.\n2. `...so pooled competition assays that infer effects from frequency shifts will have low power unless homozygotes are present at appreciable frequency.` Pooled assays measure fitness by tracking frequency changes, which are driven by the selection coefficient $s$. The signal in this assay model is $sT$. If $s \\approx 0$ for heterozygotes, they generate no signal and are indistinguishable from neutral controls, except for rare measurement noise events. Therefore, the statistical power to detect the edit is extremely low for heterozygous clones. To detect the edit at all, one must rely on detecting the homozygous clones, which have $s=s_r$ and produce a signal. If homozygous clones are rare (e.g., if $p$ is very small, making $p^2$ very small), the overall chance of finding a detectable signal for the edit (at the per-edit level) is low. The statement is a correct description of the fundamental challenge of screening for recessive alleles in diploids.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. If diploid clones are made homozygous prior to competition (for example, by a marker-swapping or iterative editing scheme that enforces $s = s_r$ in every edited clone), then, for fixed $s_r$, $T$, and $\\sigma$, the per-clone detectability becomes the same as in the haploid strategy (up to stochastic variation unrelated to ploidy).**\n\nThis is another conceptual statement. We are asked to compare the \"per-clone detectability,\" which is the hit probability for a single clone.\nThe per-clone hit probability is given by $P(\\text{hit}) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{-\\tau - sT}{\\sigma}\\right)$.\nThis probability depends only on the parameters $s$, $T$, $\\tau$, and $\\sigma$.\n- In the haploid strategy, each edited clone has $s = s_r$.\n- In the proposed modified diploid strategy, it is stated that a method is used to make every edited clone homozygous, which \"enforces $s = s_r$ in every edited clone.\"\nGiven that $s_r, T, \\sigma, \\tau$ are the same for both scenarios, and the selection coefficient $s$ is forced to be $s=s_r$ in both cases, the resulting per-clone hit probabilities must be mathematically identical. The biological detail of whether the cell is haploid or diploid is abstracted away in the fitness model, where only the selection coefficient $s$ matters. The phrase \"up to stochastic variation unrelated to ploidy\" acknowledges that real biological systems may have other complexities, but based on the provided model, the statement is true.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nIn summary, statements A, D, and E are correct.", "answer": "ADE", "id": "2778581"}]}
