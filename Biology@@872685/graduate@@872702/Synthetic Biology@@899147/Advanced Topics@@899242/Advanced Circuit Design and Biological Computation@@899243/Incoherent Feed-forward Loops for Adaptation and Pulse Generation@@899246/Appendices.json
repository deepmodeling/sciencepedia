The activating branch must be faster than the repressing branch.\n\nWith $\\tau_r  \\tau_a$, the denominator $\\tau_r - \\tau_a$ in the expression for $t_p$ is positive. For $t_p$ to be positive, the numerator $\\ln\\left(\\frac{g_a \\tau_r}{g_r \\tau_a}\\right)$ must also be positive. This requires $\\frac{g_a \\tau_r}{g_r \\tau_a}  1$, which simplifies to $\\frac{g_a}{\\tau_a}  \\frac{g_r}{\\tau_r}$. This inequality has a clear physical interpretation: the initial rate of production of the activator, $\\dot{x}(0) = g_a/\\tau_a$, must be greater than the initial rate of production of the repressor, $\\dot{y}(0) = g_r/\\tau_r$. This ensures that the output $Z(t)$ initially rises from $Z(0)=0$, which is a prerequisite for a peak.\n\nInterpretation of limiting and special cases:\n-   Case $\\tau_{r} \\gg \\tau_{a}$: The repressing branch is much slower than the activating one. In this limit, $\\frac{\\tau_{r}}{\\tau_{r}-\\tau_{a}} \\to 1$, and $t_{p} \\approx \\tau_{a}\\ln\\left(\\frac{g_{a}\\tau_{r}}{g_{r}\\tau_{a}}\\right)$. The system robustly generates a pulse. The peak time $t_{p}$ increases logarithmically with the repressor time constant $\\tau_{r}$, meaning a slower repression leads to a later peak.\n-   Case $\\tau_{a} \\gg \\tau_{r}$: The activator is much slower than the repressor. The condition for a maximum, $\\tau_{a}  \\tau_{r}$, is violated. No peak (maximum) occurs. Instead, if $\\frac{g_a}{\\tau_a}  \\frac{g_r}{\\tau_r}$, the output $Z(t)$ initially decreases, creating a trough.\n-   Case $g_{a} = g_{r}$: This corresponds to perfect adaptation, where the steady-state output is $Z(\\infty) = g_a - g_r = 0$. The output returns precisely to its pre-stimulus level. The expression for the peak time simplifies to $t_{p} = \\frac{\\tau_{a}\\tau_{r}}{\\tau_{r} - \\tau_{a}}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau_{r}}{\\tau_{a}}\\right)$. A peak exists if and only if $\\tau_{r}  \\tau_{a}$, confirming that the temporal dynamics, not just the steady-state gains, are critical for pulse generation.\n\nThe final derived expression for $t_{p}$ encapsulates these conditions.

Using the derived general formula for $Z_{\\mathrm{ss}}(X)$, these are:\n- Pre-step steady state ($X_{0}$): $Z_{\\mathrm{ss}}(X_{0}) = \\frac{1}{\\beta_{z}} \\left(\\alpha_{1} - \\frac{\\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{y}}{\\beta_{y}}\\right) X_{0} + \\frac{k_{0}}{\\beta_{z}}$\n- Post-step steady state ($X_{1}$): $Z_{\\mathrm{ss}}(X_{1}) = \\frac{1}{\\beta_{z}} \\left(\\alpha_{1} - \\frac{\\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{y}}{\\beta_{y}}\\right) X_{1} + \\frac{k_{0}}{\\beta_{z}}$\n\nPerfect adaptation occurs when the steady-state output $Z_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ is independent of the input level $X$. Inspecting the general expression for $Z_{\\mathrm{ss}}(X)$, this independence requires the coefficient of the term containing $X$ to be zero:\n$$\n\\alpha_{1} - \\frac{\\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{y}}{\\beta_{y}} = 0\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to the well-known condition for perfect adaptation in a linearized I-FFL:\n$$\n\\alpha_{1} \\beta_{y} = \\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{y}\n$$\nThis condition represents a \"balancing\" of the two pathways from $X$ to $Z$: the direct activation path (with strength proportional to $\\alpha_{1}$) and the indirect repression path (with strength proportional to $\\alpha_{2} \\frac{\\alpha_{y}}{\\beta_{y}}$).\n\nThe presence of the leaky expression term $k_{0}$ does not affect the condition for perfect adaptation, as $k_{0}$ does not appear in the expression $\\alpha_{1} \\beta_{y} = \\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{y}$. However, if the adaptation condition is met, the steady-state value of $Z$ becomes $Z_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_{0}}{\\beta_{z}}$. This means that the leaky expression sets the baseline level to which the system adapts.\n\nThe final task is to derive an expression for the baseline-subtracted steady-state change, $\\Delta Z_{\\mathrm{ss,sub}}$.

Using the expression above, this ratio can be written in terms of the effective half-lives of proteins $Y$ and $Z$:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_Y}{\\tau_Z} = \\frac{t_{1/2, Y} / \\ln 2}{t_{1/2, Z} / \\ln 2} = \\frac{t_{1/2, Y}}{t_{1/2, Z}} $$\nThus, the primary design goal is to select tags for $Y$ and $Z$ such that their effective half-lives satisfy the condition:\n$$ \\frac{t_{1/2, Y}}{t_{1/2, Z}} \\approx 3 $$\nThe problem stipulates a tolerance of approximately $10\\%$, which means the target ratio should be in the range $[2.7, 3.3]$.\n\nThe provided data for effective half-lives are:\n- no tag: $t_{1/2, \\text{none}} \\approx 60\\,\\mathrm{min}$\n- ASV tag: $t_{1/2, \\text{ASV}} \\approx 35\\,\\mathrm{min}$\n- AAV tag: $t_{1/2, \\text{AAV}} \\approx 20\\,\\mathrm{min}$\n- LVA tag: $t_{1/2, \\text{LVA}} \\approx 5\\,\\mathrm{min}$\n\nWe will now evaluate each option by checking the half-life ratio and the correctness of the stated degradation rate $\\delta_{\\mathrm{tag},Z}$. The tag-induced degradation rate for $Z$, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{tag},Z}$, is calculated as $\\delta_{\\mathrm{tag},Z} = \\delta_Z - \\mu$. The total decay rate is $\\delta_Z = \\ln 2 / t_{1/2, Z}$, and the dilution rate is $\\mu = \\ln 2 / 60\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, as derived from the cell doubling time of $60\\,\\mathrm{min}$.\n$$ \\delta_{\\mathrm{tag},Z} = \\frac{\\ln 2}{t_{1/2, Z}} - \\frac{\\ln 2}{60\\,\\mathrm{min}} = \\ln 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{t_{1/2, Z}} - \\frac{1}{60\\,\\mathrm{min}} \\right) $$\n\n**Option A: $Y$: no tag, $Z$: AAV; estimated required $\\delta_{\\mathrm{tag},Z} \\approx 0.023\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$**\n- **Tag selection:** For $Y$, \"no tag\" means $t_{1/2, Y} = 60\\,\\mathrm{min}$. For $Z$, the AAV tag means $t_{1/2, Z} = 20\\,\\mathrm{min}$.\n- **Ratio calculation:**\n$$ \\frac{t_{1/2, Y}}{t_{1/2, Z}} = \\frac{60\\,\\mathrm{min}}{20\\,\\mathrm{min}} = 3 $$\nThis ratio is exactly the target value of $3$, which is well within the $10\\%$ tolerance.\n- **Degradation rate calculation:** For the AAV tag on $Z$:\n$$ \\delta_{\\mathrm{tag},Z} = \\ln 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{20\\,\\mathrm{min}} - \\frac{1}{60\\,\\mathrm{min}} \\right) = \\ln 2 \\left( \\frac{3 - 1}{60\\,\\mathrm{min}} \\right) = \\frac{2 \\ln 2}{60\\,\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{\\ln 2}{30}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1} $$\nNumerically, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{tag},Z} \\approx \\frac{0.6931}{30}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1} \\approx 0.0231\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. This matches the estimate of $\\approx 0.023\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$ provided in the option.\n- **Pulse condition:** For pulse generation, the repression arm must be slower, i.e., $\\tau_Y  \\tau_Z$. Here, $\\tau_Y = 3 \\tau_Z$, which is the canonical condition for a strong pulse. The timescale for $Z$ is $\\tau_Z = t_{1/2,Z}/\\ln 2 \\approx 20\\,\\mathrm{min}/0.693 \\approx 29\\,\\mathrm{min}$, which is a sufficiently rapid response for dynamics in *E. coli*.\n- **Verdict on A:** **Correct**. This option satisfies all criteria.\n\n**Option B: $Y$: ASV, $Z$: AAV; estimated required $\\delta_{\\mathrm{tag},Z} \\approx 0.012\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$**\n- **Tag selection:** For $Y$, the ASV tag means $t_{1/2, Y} = 35\\,\\mathrm{min}$. For $Z$, the AAV tag means $t_{1/2, Z} = 20\\,\\mathrm{min}$.\n- **Ratio calculation:**\n$$ \\frac{t_{1/2, Y}}{t_{1/2, Z}} = \\frac{35\\,\\mathrm{min}}{20\\,\\mathrm{min}} = 1.75 $$\nThis ratio is not within the acceptable range of $[2.7, 3.3]$. Furthermore, the estimated $\\delta_{\\mathrm{tag},Z}$ is given as $\\approx 0.012\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, which is inconsistent with the correct value of $\\approx 0.0231\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$ for the AAV tag.\n- **Verdict on B:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C: $Y$: no tag, $Z$: LVA; estimated required $\\delta_{\\mathrm{tag},Z} \\approx 0.023\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$**\n- **Tag selection:** For $Y$, \"no tag\" means $t_{1/2, Y} = 60\\,\\mathrm{min}$. For $Z$, the LVA tag means $t_{1/2, Z} = 5\\,\\mathrm{min}$.\n- **Ratio calculation:**\n$$ \\frac{t_{1/2, Y}}{t_{1/2, Z}} = \\frac{60\\,\\mathrm{min}}{5\\,\\mathrm{min}} = 12 $$\nThis ratio is far from the target of $3$. Also, the estimated $\\delta_{\\mathrm{tag},Z}$ is given as $\\approx 0.023\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, which corresponds to the AAV tag, not the LVA tag. The correct value for the LVA tag would be $\\delta_{\\mathrm{tag},Z} = \\ln 2 (1/5 - 1/60) = \\ln 2 (11/60) \\approx 0.127\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n- **Verdict on C:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D: $Y$: ASV, $Z$: ASV; estimated required $\\delta_{\\mathrm{tag},Z} \\approx 0.008\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$**\n- **Tag selection:** Both $Y$ and $Z$ have the ASV tag, so $t_{1/2, Y} = t_{1/2, Z} = 35\\,\\mathrm{min}$.\n- **Ratio calculation:**\n$$ \\frac{t_{1/2, Y}}{t_{1/2, Z}} = \\frac{35\\,\\mathrm{min}}{35\\,\\mathrm{min}} = 1 $$\nA ratio of $1$ means the activation and repression pathways have identical timescales, which will not produce a transient pulse. The system will behave as a simple activator. This fails the primary design goal. While the estimated $\\delta_{\\mathrm{tag},Z}$ value is approximately correct for the ASV tag ($\\delta_{\\mathrm{tag},Z} = \\ln 2 (1/35 - 1/60) = \\ln 2 (5/420) \\approx 0.00825\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$), the choice of tags is fundamentally wrong for the intended function.\n- **Verdict on D:** **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on this analysis, only option A correctly implements the design specifications for the incoherent feed-forward loop.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2747284"}]}
