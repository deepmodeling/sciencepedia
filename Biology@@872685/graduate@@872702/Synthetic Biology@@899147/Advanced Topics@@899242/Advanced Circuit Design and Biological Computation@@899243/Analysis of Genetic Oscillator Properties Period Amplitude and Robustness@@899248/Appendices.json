Each gene produces a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) that is translated into a protein; both species are degraded. Assume the following fundamental base:\n- Central Dogma of Molecular Biology: DNA is transcribed to mRNA, and mRNA is translated to protein. In a well-mixed cell, the temporal dynamics of abundances can be modeled by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the form production minus degradation.\n- Repression of transcription by a protein is described by a Hill repression function with threshold concentration and cooperativity, reflecting equilibrium binding of transcription factor to promoter sites and strong-timescale separation between binding and transcriptional elongation.\n- First-order degradation of mRNA and protein reflects dilution and active degradation processes.\n\nUsing only these bases, consider a three-gene ring with cyclic indexing, where the protein of gene $i-1$ represses transcription of gene $i$. Choose the option that correctly specifies:\n(i) the standard dimensional ODEs for mRNA and protein for each node in the ring, and\n(ii) a parameter regime usually associated with sustained limit-cycle oscillations in single cells, together with the dominant qualitative dependencies of period and amplitude on key parameters.\n\nOptions:\nA.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing all necessary information to construct the mathematical model and analyze its behavior based on established theory of nonlinear dynamical systems. The problem contains no scientific flaws, ambiguities, or contradictions.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem statement is valid.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Model and Dynamics\n\nWe will now derive the equations and analyze the conditions for oscillation as requested. Let $m_{i}$ be the concentration of the mRNA from gene $i$ and $p_{i}$ be the concentration of the protein from gene $i$. The indices are cyclic, so for $i=1$, $i-1$ is $3$.\n\n**Part (i): Mathematical Model (ODEs)**\n\nFor each gene $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$:\n\n**1. Equation for mRNA concentration, $\\dot{m}_{i}$:**\n*   **Production:** The problem states that transcription of gene $i$ is repressed by protein $p_{i-1}$. This is described by a Hill repression function. The maximal rate of transcription is $\\alpha$. The concentration of the repressor is $p_{i-1}$, the threshold for repression is $K$, and the cooperativity is $n$. The production rate is therefore $\\dfrac{\\alpha}{1 + (p_{i-1}/K)^{n}}$.\n*   **Degradation:** mRNA undergoes first-order degradation with a rate constant $\\delta_{m}$. The degradation rate is $\\delta_{m}m_{i}$.\n*   **Full Equation:** Combining production and degradation gives:\n    $$ \\dot{m}_{i} = \\dfrac{\\alpha}{1+\\left(\\dfrac{p_{i-1}}{K}\\right)^{n}} - \\delta_{m}m_{i} $$\n\n**2. Equation for protein concentration, $\\dot{p}_{i}$:**\n*   **Production:** The protein $p_{i}$ is translated from its mRNA, $m_{i}$. This is modeled as a linear process with a rate constant $\\beta$. The production rate is $\\beta m_{i}$.\n*   **Degradation:** Protein undergoes first-order degradation with a rate constant $\\delta_{p}$. The degradation rate is $\\delta_{p}p_{i}$.\n*   **Full Equation:** Combining production and degradation gives:\n    $$ \\dot{p}_{i} = \\beta m_{i} - \\delta_{p}p_{i} $$\n\nThus, the system of $6$ ODEs for $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ is:\n$$ \\dot{m}_{i}=\\dfrac{\\alpha}{1+\\left(\\dfrac{p_{i-1}}{K}\\right)^{n}}-\\delta_{m}m_{i} $$\n$$ \\dot{p}_{i}=\\beta m_{i}-\\delta_{p}p_{i} $$\n\n**Part (ii): Conditions for Sustained Oscillations**\n\nSustained oscillations in a negative feedback loop require two main features: sufficient time delay and sufficient loop gain (nonlinearity).\n\n*   **Nonlinearity and Gain:** The system must be able to create an instability at its steady state. Linear stability analysis of the repressilator's unique fixed point shows that a Hopf bifurcation, leading to a limit cycle, occurs only if the repression is sufficiently switch-like. This is governed by the Hill coefficient $n$. For a $3$-node ring, the condition for instability is that the cooperativity must be high, specifically $n  2$. Low cooperativity ($n \\le 1$) results in a stable steady state. Furthermore, the overall loop gain must be high enough. This gain depends on the production and degradation parameters. High concentrations, achieved through large synthesis rates ($\\alpha$, $\\beta$) relative to degradation rates ($\\delta_{m}$, $\\delta_{p}$), contribute to a higher loop gain and a wider dynamic range, which are favorable for oscillations.\n\n*   **Time Delay and Period:** A time delay is necessary for the signal propagating around the negative feedback loop to arrive out of phase, thus driving oscillations instead of settling to a steady state. The delay in this system is created by the sequential processes of transcription, translation, and degradation for each of the three genes. The dominant timescale in the system often sets the period of oscillation. A common and robust design involves a separation of timescales where mRNA is much less stable than the protein, i.e., $\\delta_{m} \\gg \\delta_{p}$. In this regime, the mRNA concentration quickly equilibrates relative to the protein concentration. The protein lifetime, $1/\\delta_p$, becomes the slowest process and thus the main contributor to the loop's delay. The period of oscillation, $T$, is then primarily determined by the sum of these slow timescales around the loop, leading to $T$ scaling on the order of $1/\\delta_{p}$.\n\n*   **Amplitude:** The amplitude of the protein oscillations is determined by the range between the minimum and maximum achievable protein concentrations. The maximum concentration is roughly proportional to the product of the maximum production rates and the species' lifetimes, i.e., $p_{max} \\propto (\\alpha/\\delta_m) \\times (\\beta/\\delta_p)$. Therefore, amplitude increases with larger synthesis rates ($\\alpha, \\beta$) and decreases with larger degradation rates ($\\delta_m, \\delta_p$). Stronger cooperativity (larger $n$) makes the repression more switch-like, allowing the system to oscillate between states closer to fully \"on\" and fully \"off\", which also increases the oscillation amplitude.\n\n*   **Robustness:** The robustness of oscillations (their persistence in the face of molecular noise and parameter variations) is enhanced by a stronger instability, which corresponds to a higher loop gain and a more pronounced nonlinearity. Therefore, robustness generally improves with a larger Hill coefficient $n$ and larger production-to-degradation ratios.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**Option A:**\n*   **ODEs:** $\\dot{m}_{i}=\\dfrac{\\alpha}{1+\\left(\\dfrac{p_{i-1}}{K}\\right)^{n}}-\\delta_{m}m_{i}$ and $\\dot{p}_{i}=\\beta m_{i}-\\delta_{p}p_{i}$. These equations match our derivation. **Correct**.\n*   **Dynamics:** States oscillations require ultrasensitivity ($n \\gtrsim 2$), high loop gain, and a timescale separation $\\delta_{m} \\gg \\delta_{p}$. It correctly states that in this regime, the period scales with $1/\\delta_{p}$, and the amplitude increases with $\\alpha$ and $n$ and decreases with $\\delta_{p}$. It also correctly states that robustness improves with larger $n$ and production/degradation ratios. All these statements are consistent with the established theory. **Correct**.\n*   **Verdict:** This option is fully correct.\n\n**Option B:**\n*   **ODEs:** $\\dot{m}_{i}=\\alpha \\dfrac{\\left(\\dfrac{p_{i-1}}{K}\\right)^{n}}{1+\\left(\\dfrac{p_{i-1}}{K}\\right)^{n}}-\\delta_{m}m_{i}$. The production term is a Hill *activation* function, not repression as required by the problem statement. This would create a positive feedback loop. **Incorrect**.\n*   **Dynamics:** States oscillations are favored for $n \\le 1$ (weak repression) and $\\delta_{p} \\gg \\delta_{m}$ (fast protein). These conditions are contrary to the requirements for robust oscillations. It also incorrectly claims amplitude increases with larger $\\delta_{p}$. Increased protein degradation would decrease protein levels and thus amplitude. **Incorrect**.\n*   **Verdict:** This option is incorrect in its formulation of the model and its description of the dynamics.\n\n**Option C:**\n*   **ODEs:** The equations are correct.\n*   **Dynamics:** States oscillations require low cooperativity $n \\le 1$. This is fundamentally incorrect; high cooperativity is required. It also claims that an increase in $\\delta_{p}$ increases amplitude, which is false. **Incorrect**.\n*   **Verdict:** This option, while presenting the correct ODEs, makes multiple false claims about the conditions required for oscillation.\n\n**Option D:**\n*   **ODEs:** Includes a basal leak term $\\alpha_0$. While a plausible model refinement, it is not what is specified by the problem's base principles.\n*   **Dynamics:** Claims oscillations are *only* possible with leak, which is false. It claims that stronger cooperativity $n$ *suppresses* oscillations, which is the exact opposite of the truth. It claims the period *decreases* with smaller $\\delta_{p}$, which is also false (a smaller $\\delta_{p}$ means a longer protein lifetime and thus a *longer* period). It claims amplitude is independent of $\\alpha$, which is false. Every dynamic claim is incorrect. **Incorrect**.\n*   **Verdict:** This option presents a slightly different model and a completely erroneous description of the system's dynamics.\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, Option A is the only one that correctly specifies both the mathematical model and the qualitative properties of the oscillatory regime.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2714244"}, {"introduction": "Building on the foundational model, this practice delves into the rigorous mathematical analysis of an oscillator's stability.

The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of nonlinear dynamics and synthetic biology, is well-posed, and uses objective, formal language. The model, based on a Hill function for repression and first-order degradation, is standard. The use of an amplitude equation derived from averaging methods is a canonical approach for analyzing such oscillators.\n\nThe dynamics of the repressor concentration, $x(t)$, can be described by a differential equation that incorporates production and degradation:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x) - \\gamma x = \\frac{p_{\\max}}{1+\\left(\\frac{x}{K}\\right)^{h}} - \\gamma x\n$$\nThe problem postulates that near a Hopf bifurcation, the solution is a slowly-modulated sinusoid, $x(t) = \\bar{x} + A(t)\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$, where $\\bar{x}$ is the steady-state concentration (the fixed point of the dynamics), and $A(t)$ is the slowly varying amplitude of oscillation.

Our first task is to provide a rationale for the specific form of $\\sigma(A)$ provided.\n\nThe problem states that $\\sigma(A)$ is determined by the promoter's contribution to the fundamental harmonic of the oscillation. This is the central idea of the describing function method. The effective gain of the nonlinearity, when driven by a sinusoid of amplitude $A$, is averaged over one cycle. This effective gain, which we identify with $\\sigma(A)$, must decrease with amplitude due to saturation of the Hill function. For small amplitudes $A \\to 0$, the system behaves linearly, and the growth rate approaches the small-signal loop gain, which we call $\\sigma_0$. As the amplitude $A$ increases, the oscillation begins to sample the saturated parts of the Hill function (where $x \\gg K$ or $x \\ll K$), where the gain $|f'(x)|$ is small. This causes the effective gain $\\sigma(A)$ to decrease.\n\nA rigorous derivation of the describing function for a Hill-type nonlinearity is complex.

For large amplitudes ($A \\gg A_s$), the term $(A/A_s)^h$ dominates the denominator, causing $\\sigma(A)$ to decrease as $A^{-h}$. This represents the gain compression caused by promoter saturation.\n3.  The parameter $A_s$ sets the amplitude scale at which saturation becomes significant. It represents the transition from the linear to the saturated regime.\n4.  The parameter $h$ controls the sharpness of this transition, consistent with its role in determining the steepness of the underlying Hill function.\n\nThis functional form is a standard and effective model for gain saturation in nonlinear systems, and we proceed by accepting its validity as asserted by the problem statement.\n\nNext, we must find the nonzero steady-state amplitude, denoted $A^*$. A steady state for the amplitude implies that a stable limit cycle has been reached, and the amplitude no longer changes, i.e., $\\frac{dA}{dt} = 0$. From the amplitude equation:\n$$\n[\\sigma(A^*) - \\gamma] A^* = 0\n$$\nThis equation has two solutions for $A^*$.\nThe first is the trivial solution, $A^* = 0$. This corresponds to the non-oscillating steady state. The stability of this point is determined by the sign of $\\sigma(0)-\\gamma = \\sigma_0 - \\gamma$. Since the problem gives $\\sigma_0 = 1.8\\ \\text{h}^{-1}$ and $\\gamma = 0.6\\ \\text{h}^{-1}$, we have $\\sigma_0  \\gamma$, which means the fixed point at $A^*=0$ is unstable. Any small perturbation will grow, leading to oscillations.\n\nThe second solution corresponds to the stable limit cycle amplitude and is found by setting the term in brackets to zero:\n$$\n\\sigma(A^*) - \\gamma = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma(A^*)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma_0}{1+\\left(\\frac{A^*}{A_s}\\right)^h} = \\gamma\n$$\nWe now solve for $A^*$:\n$$\n1 + \\left(\\frac{A^*}{A_s}\\right)^h = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\gamma}\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{A^*}{A_s}\\right)^h = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\gamma} - 1 = \\frac{\\sigma_0 - \\gamma}{\\gamma}\n$$\nSince $\\sigma_0  \\gamma$, the right-hand side is positive, yielding a real, positive solution for $A^*$:\n$$\n\\frac{A^*}{A_s} = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_0 - \\gamma}{\\gamma}\\right)^{1/h}\n$$\n$$\nA^* = A_s \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_0 - \\gamma}{\\gamma}\\right)^{1/h}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the nonzero steady-state amplitude. The existence of this finite, stable amplitude demonstrates that promoter saturation imposes an upper bound on the oscillation amplitude, preventing it from growing indefinitely.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $A^*$ using the given parameters: $\\sigma_0 = 1.8\\ \\text{h}^{-1}$, $\\gamma = 0.6\\ \\text{h}^{-1}$, $A_s = 100\\ \\text{nM}$, and $h=4$.\n$$\nA^* = 100 \\left(\\frac{1.8 - 0.6}{0.6}\\right)^{1/4}\n$$\n$$\nA^* = 100 \\left(\\frac{1.2}{0.6}\\right)^{1/4}\n$$\n$$\nA^* = 100 \\left(2\\right)^{1/4}\n$$\nThe value of $2^{1/4}$ is approximately $1.189207$.\n$$\nA^* \\approx 100 \\times 1.189207 = 118.9207\\ \\text{nM}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required, we get:\n$$\nA^* = 118.9\\ \\text{nM}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{118.9}$$", "id": "2714184"}]}
