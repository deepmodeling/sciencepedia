It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in mathematical biology that requires a rigorous application of differential calculus. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe first objective is to find the small-signal gain, $g(u)$, which is the first derivative of $y(u)$ with respect to $u$.\n\nThe given function is:\n$$y(u) = y_{min} + \\left(y_{max} - y_{min}\\right)\\frac{u^{n}}{K^{n} + u^{n}}$$\nLet the constant difference in output levels be $\\Delta y = y_{max} - y_{min}$. The function becomes:\n$$y(u) = y_{min} + \\Delta y \\frac{u^{n}}{K^{n} + u^{n}}$$\nThe gain $g(u)$ is defined as $\\frac{dy}{du}$.\n$$g(u) = \\frac{d}{du} \\left( y_{min} + \\Delta y \\frac{u^{n}}{K^{n} + u^{n}} \\right)$$\nThe derivative of the constant $y_{min}$ is $0$. We apply the constant multiple rule and the quotient rule for differentiation to the second term.\n$$g(u) = \\Delta y \\cdot \\frac{d}{du} \\left( \\frac{u^{n}}{K^{n} + u^{n}} \\right)$$\nUsing the quotient rule, $\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{f}{h} \\right) = \\frac{f'h - fh'}{h^2}$, with $f(u) = u^n$ and $h(u) = K^n + u^n$.\nThe derivatives are $f'(u) = n u^{n-1}$ and $h'(u) = n u^{n-1}$.\nSubstituting these into the quotient rule:\n$$g(u) = \\Delta y \\cdot \\frac{(n u^{n-1})(K^{n} + u^{n}) - (u^{n})(n u^{n-1})}{(K^{n} + u^{n})^{2}}$$\nWe expand the numerator:\n$$g(u) = \\Delta y \\cdot \\frac{n K^{n} u^{n-1} + n u^{2n-1} - n u^{2n-1}}{(K^{n} + u^{n})^{2}}$$\nThe term $n u^{2n-1}$ cancels out, simplifying the expression:\n$$g(u) = \\Delta y \\cdot \\frac{n K^{n} u^{n-1}}{(K^{n} + u^{n})^{2}}$$\nSubstituting back $\\Delta y = y_{max} - y_{min}$, we arrive at the first required expression:\n$$g(u) = (y_{max} - y_{min}) \\frac{n K^{n} u^{n-1}}{(K^{n} + u^{n})^{2}}$$\n\nThe second objective is to find the value of $u$ that maximizes $g(u)$. To find this maximum, we must find the critical points of $g(u)$ by setting its derivative, $\\frac{dg}{du}$, to $0$.\nLet the constant part of $g(u)$ be $C = (y_{max} - y_{min}) n K^{n}$. Since $y_{max} > y_{min}$, $n > 1$, and $K > 0$, the constant $C$ is positive. The maximization problem is equivalent to maximizing the function $f(u) = \\frac{u^{n-1}}{(K^{n} + u^{n})^{2}}$.\n$$\\frac{dg}{du} = C \\cdot \\frac{d}{du} \\left( \\frac{u^{n-1}}{(K^{n} + u^{n})^{2}} \\right) = 0$$\nWe apply the quotient rule again.

We can divide the equation by the common factor $u^{n-2}(K^{n} + u^{n})$:\n$$(n-1)(K^{n} + u^{n}) - 2n u^{n} = 0$$\nNow, we solve for $u^{n}$:\n$$(n-1)K^{n} + (n-1)u^{n} - 2n u^{n} = 0$$\n$$(n-1)K^{n} = 2n u^{n} - (n-1)u^{n}$$\n$$(n-1)K^{n} = (2n - n + 1)u^{n}$$\n$$(n-1)K^{n} = (n+1)u^{n}$$\n$$u^{n} = K^{n} \\frac{n-1}{n+1}$$\nTaking the $n$-th root of both sides gives the value of $u$ that maximizes the gain:\n$$u = K \\left( \\frac{n-1}{n+1} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}}$$\nSince $n>1$, the term $\\frac{n-1}{n+1}$ is always positive and less than $1$, which yields a unique, real, and positive value for $u$. At $u=0$, $g(u)=0$ (since $n-1 > 0$), and as $u \\to \\infty$, $g(u) \\to 0$.

The scale factor $s$ is to be estimated by minimizing the sum of squared residuals for the $N=4$ provided calibration data points $(x_i, y_i)$. The objective function to minimize is:\n$$J(s) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - s x_i)^2$$\nTo find the value of $s$ that minimizes $J(s)$, we compute the derivative with respect to $s$ and set it to zero:\n$$\\frac{dJ}{ds} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{d}{ds} (y_i - s x_i)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} 2(y_i - s x_i)(-x_i) = -2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i x_i - s x_i^2) = 0$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i x_i - s \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i^2 = 0$$\n$$\\hat{s} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i x_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i^2}$$\nThe provided data pairs are $(150, 3.0 \\times 10^3)$, $(1500, 3.0 \\times 10^4)$, $(15000, 3.0 \\times 10^5)$, and $(150000, 3.0 \\times 10^6)$. We observe that for each pair $(x_i, y_i)$, the ratio $y_i/x_i$ is constant:\n$$\\frac{3.0 \\times 10^3}{150} = 20$$\n$$\\frac{3.0 \\times 10^4}{1500} = 20$$\n$$\\frac{3.0 \\times 10^5}{15000} = 20$$\n$$\\frac{3.0 \\times 10^6}{150000} = 20$$\nSince the data points fall perfectly on a line $y = 20x$, the least-squares estimate must be $\\hat{s}=20$. Formally, if $y_i = k x_i$ for a constant $k$, the formula for $\\hat{s}$ yields:\n$$\\hat{s} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (k x_i) x_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i^2} = \\frac{k \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i^2} = k$$\nThus, the calibration factor is $s = 20$ MEFL per arbitrary unit.\n\nPart 2: Calibration of Cell Population Intensities\nUsing the determined scale factor $s=20$, we convert the median fluorescence intensities of the OFF and ON cell populations from arbitrary units to MEFL.\nFor the OFF-state population:\n$$y_{OFF} = s \\cdot x_{OFF} = 20 \\cdot 900 = 18000 \\text{ MEFL}$$\nFor the ON-state population:\n$$y_{ON} = s \\cdot x_{ON} = 20 \\cdot 90000 = 1800000 \\text{ MEFL}$$\n\nPart 3: Derivation of the Bayes-Optimal Decision Threshold\nLet $Y$ be the random variable for a single-cell fluorescence measurement in MEFL. The problem states that $Y$ follows a log-normal distribution. This implies that the variable $Z = \\ln(Y)$ follows a normal (Gaussian) distribution.\nLet $C_{OFF}$ and $C_{ON}$ be the classes for the OFF and ON states, respectively.\nFor a cell in class $C_{OFF}$, its log-fluorescence $Z$ is distributed as $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{OFF}, \\sigma^2)$.\nFor a cell in class $C_{ON}$, its log-fluorescence $Z$ is distributed as $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{ON}, \\sigma^2)$.\nThe variance $\\sigma^2$ is assumed to be equal for both classes.\nThe median of a log-normal distribution with parameters $(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ is $\\exp(\\mu)$. The problem provides the median fluorescence values $y_{OFF}$ and $y_{ON}$. Therefore:\n$\\mu_{OFF} = \\ln(y_{OFF})$\n$\\mu_{ON} = \\ln(y_{ON})$\nThe Bayes-optimal decision rule aims to minimize the probability of misclassification. This is achieved by assigning a measurement $y$ to the class with the highest posterior probability. The decision threshold $y_{th}$ is the value where the posterior probabilities are equal:\n$$P(C_{ON}|y=y_{th}) = P(C_{OFF}|y=y_{th})$$\nUsing Bayes' theorem, $P(C_i|y) = \\frac{p(y|C_i)P(C_i)}{p(y)}$, the condition becomes:\n$$\\frac{p(y_{th}|C_{ON})P(C_{ON})}{p(y_{th})} = \\frac{p(y_{th}|C_{OFF})P(C_{OFF})}{p(y_{th})}$$\n$$p(y_{th}|C_{ON})P(C_{ON}) = p(y_{th}|C_{OFF})P(C_{OFF})$$\nThe problem specifies equal class priors, $P(C_{ON}) = P(C_{OFF})$, so the condition simplifies to equality of the class-conditional likelihoods:\n$$p(y_{th}|C_{ON}) = p(y_{th}|C_{OFF})$$\nIt is more convenient to work with the log-transformed variable $z = \\ln(y)$. The threshold in log space, $z_{th} = \\ln(y_{th})$, is where $p(z_{th}|C_{ON}) = p(z_{th}|C_{OFF})$.
