I will proceed with the derivation.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe problem concerns two competing, independent stochastic processes: termination and elongation. Let $T_{t}$ be the random variable representing the waiting time until termination, and let $T_{e}$ be the random variable representing the waiting time until elongation.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, these waiting times are independent and follow exponential distributions. The probability density function (PDF) of an exponential distribution with a rate parameter $\\lambda$ is given by $f(t) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t)$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nThus, the PDF for the termination time $T_t$ is:\n$$ f_{T_t}(t) = k_{t} \\exp(-k_{t} t) $$\nAnd the PDF for the elongation time $T_e$ is:\n$$ f_{T_e}(t) = k_{e} \\exp(-k_{e} t) $$\n\nRead-through occurs if the elongation event happens before the termination event, which mathematically translates to the condition $T_{e}  T_{t}$. We are asked to find the probability of this event, $P_{\\mathrm{rt}} = P(T_{e}  T_{t})$.\n\nSince $T_{e}$ and $T_{t}$ are independent random variables, their joint probability density function $f(t_e, t_t)$ is the product of their individual PDFs:\n$$ f(t_e, t_t) = f_{T_e}(t_e) f_{T_t}(t_t) = k_{e} \\exp(-k_{e} t_e) \\cdot k_{t} \\exp(-k_{t} t_t) $$\n\nTo find the probability $P(T_{e}  T_{t})$, we must integrate this joint PDF over the region in the $t_e-t_t$ plane where $0 \\le t_e  t_t  \\infty$.\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{rt}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\int_{0}^{t_t} f(t_e, t_t) \\, dt_e \\, dt_t $$\nSubstituting the expression for the joint PDF:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{rt}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\int_{0}^{t_t} k_{e} \\exp(-k_{e} t_e) k_{t} \\exp(-k_{t} t_t) \\, dt_e \\right) \\, dt_t $$\nWe can treat $k_{t} \\exp(-k_{t} t_t)$ as a constant with respect to the inner integral over $t_e$.\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{rt}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} k_{t} \\exp(-k_{t} t_t) \\left( \\int_{0}^{t_t} k_{e} \\exp(-k_{e} t_e) \\, dt_e \\right) \\, dt_t $$\nLet us evaluate the inner integral first:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{t_t} k_{e} \\exp(-k_{e} t_e) \\, dt_e = \\left[ -\\exp(-k_{e} t_e) \\right]_{0}^{t_t} = (-\\exp(-k_{e} t_t)) - (-\\exp(-k_{e} \\cdot 0)) = 1 - \\exp(-k_{e} t_t) $$\nThis inner result represents the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of $T_e$ evaluated at $t_t$, i.e., $P(T_e \\le t_t)$.\n\nNow, we substitute this back into the outer integral:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{rt}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} k_{t} \\exp(-k_{t} t_t) \\left( 1 - \\exp(-k_{e} t_t) \\right) \\, dt_t $$\nWe expand the integrand:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{rt}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} k_{t} \\exp(-k_{t} t_t) \\, dt_t - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} k_{t} \\exp(-k_{t} t_t) \\exp(-k_{e} t_t) \\, dt_t $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{rt}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} k_{t} \\exp(-k_{t} t_t) \\, dt_t - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} k_{t} \\exp(-(k_{t} + k_{e}) t_t) \\, dt_t $$\nThe first integral, $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} k_{t} \\exp(-k_{t} t_t) \\, dt_t$, is the integral of the PDF of $T_t$ over its entire support, which is by definition equal to $1$.\nThe second integral is evaluated as:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} k_{t} \\exp(-(k_{t} + k_{e}) t_t) \\, dt_t = k_{t} \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-(k_{t} + k_{e}) t_t)}{-(k_{t} + k_{e})} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} $$\n$$ = k_{t} \\left( 0 - \\frac{\\exp(0)}{-(k_{t} + k_{e})} \\right) = k_{t} \\left( \\frac{1}{k_{t} + k_{e}} \\right) = \\frac{k_{t}}{k_{t} + k_{e}} $$\nCombining the results of the two integrals:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{rt}} = 1 - \\frac{k_{t}}{k_{t} + k_{e}} = \\frac{(k_{t} + k_{e}) - k_{t}}{k_{t} + k_{e}} = \\frac{k_{e}}{k_{t} + k_{e}} $$\nThis is the derived closed-form expression for the read-through probability. This result is intuitive: the probability of a specific process winning a kinetic competition is its rate divided by the sum of the rates of all competing processes.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nWe are given $k_{t} = 3\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ and $k_{e} = 1\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.
