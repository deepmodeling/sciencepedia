To inform governance decisions, they require a first-principles derivation of the minimal drive efficiency needed for the drive to invade from rarity, given a specified viability cost. Assume the following population-genetic model, grounded in Mendelian inheritance and viability selection:\n\n- There are two alleles at a single locus: a wildtype allele $W$ and a homing gene drive allele $D$.\n- The life cycle is: random mating to form zygotes, viability selection, meiosis with potential homing conversion, and random union of gametes to form the next generation of zygotes.\n- When a $W D$ heterozygote undergoes gametogenesis, homing converts the $W$ allele to $D$ with probability $h \\in [0,1]$. As a result, a $W D$ heterozygote contributes a fraction $(1+h)/2$ of its gametes as $D$, and a fraction $(1-h)/2$ as $W$. Wildtype $W W$ individuals contribute only $W$ gametes. Assume both sexes have identical homing efficiency $h$, and fertility is unaffected by genotype.\n- Viability selection acts before gametogenesis with fitnesses $w_{W W}=1$ and $w_{W D}=1-s$, where $s \\in [0,1)$ is the heterozygote viability cost of carrying the drive. The homozygote $D D$ class may have any fitness, but since the drive is initially rare, its contribution can be neglected to first order in the drive frequency.\n\nLet $p_t$ denote the frequency of the drive allele $D$ among zygotes in generation $t$, with $p_t \\ll 1$. Using only the core definitions of Hardy–Weinberg formation of zygotes, viability selection, and Mendelian segregation modified by homing conversion, derive from first principles the condition under which the drive invades when rare, expressed as a strict inequality on the per-generation growth factor of $p_t$. From this, identify the closed-form expression $h^{\\ast}(s)$ giving the minimal homing efficiency required for invasion as a function of the cost $s$, defined by the property that invasion occurs if and only if $h  h^{\\ast}(s)$.\n\nFinally, specify the parameter ranges in the $(h,s)$ unit square for which invasion is possible, taking into account the biological bounds $h \\in [0,1]$ and $s \\in [0,1)$. Your final answer must be the single analytic expression for $h^{\\ast}(s)$; do not include units. If you obtain a numerical value, round to $4$ significant figures; otherwise provide the exact expression.", "solution": "The problem statement is deemed valid. It presents a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in population genetics, the solution of which is a cornerstone for assessing the behavior of gene drive systems. Such quantitative analysis is an indispensable prerequisite for developing rational governance and biosafety guidelines for emerging biotechnologies like synthetic gene drives. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. I will proceed with a first-principles derivation.\n\nLet $p_t$ be the frequency of the homing drive allele $D$ and $q_t = 1-p_t$ be the frequency of the wildtype allele $W$ among the zygotes of generation $t$. The analysis of invasion from rarity requires us to examine the dynamics of $p_t$ when $p_t \\ll 1$.\n\nStep 1: Zygote Frequencies\nUnder the assumption of random mating, the frequencies of the three genotypes ($WW$, $WD$, $DD$) in the zygotes of generation $t$ are given by the Hardy–Weinberg proportions:\n- Frequency($WW$) $= (1-p_t)^2$\n- Frequency($WD$) $= 2p_t(1-p_t)$\n- Frequency($DD$) $= p_t^2$\n\nStep 2: Viability Selection\nNext, these zygotes are subject to viability selection before reaching reproductive maturity. The relative fitnesses are given as $w_{WW} = 1$ and $w_{WD} = 1-s$. The fitness of the $DD$ homozygote, $w_{DD}$, is not specified, but its contribution is negligible for an invasion analysis, as its frequency is of order $p_t^2$. The frequencies of the genotypes after selection are proportional to their initial frequencies multiplied by their respective fitness values.\nThe mean fitness of the population in generation $t$, $\\bar{w}_t$, is the sum of these products:\n$$ \\bar{w}_t = w_{WW} (1-p_t)^2 + w_{WD} 2p_t(1-p_t) + w_{DD} p_t^2 $$\n$$ \\bar{w}_t = 1 \\cdot (1-p_t)^2 + (1-s) \\cdot 2p_t(1-p_t) + w_{DD} p_t^2 $$\nThe frequencies of the genotypes among the surviving adults are then normalized by $\\bar{w}_t$:\n- Frequency(adult $WW$) $= \\frac{(1-p_t)^2}{\\bar{w}_t}$\n- Frequency(adult $WD$) $= \\frac{2p_t(1-p_t)(1-s)}{\\bar{w}_t}$\n- Frequency(adult $DD$) $= \\frac{w_{DD} p_t^2}{\\bar{w}_t}$\n\nStep 3: Gamete Production and Homing\nThese adults produce gametes to form the next generation. The allele frequencies in this new gamete pool will determine $p_{t+1}$.\n- Adult $WW$ individuals are of frequency $\\frac{(1-p_t)^2}{\\bar{w}_t}$ and produce only $W$ gametes.\n- Adult $WD$ individuals are of frequency $\\frac{2p_t(1-p_t)(1-s)}{\\bar{w}_t}$. Due to homing with efficiency $h$, they produce a fraction $\\frac{1+h}{2}$ of $D$ gametes and a fraction $\\frac{1-h}{2}$ of $W$ gametes.\n- Adult $DD$ individuals are of frequency $\\frac{w_{DD} p_t^2}{\\bar{w}_t}$ and produce only $D$ gametes.\n\nThe frequency of the $D$ allele in the next generation, $p_{t+1}$, is the sum of contributions from heterozygotes and drive homozygotes:\n$$ p_{t+1} = \\left( \\frac{2p_t(1-p_t)(1-s)}{\\bar{w}_t} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1+h}{2} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{w_{DD} p_t^2}{\\bar{w}_t} \\right) \\cdot 1 $$\n$$ p_{t+1} = \\frac{p_t(1-p_t)(1-s)(1+h) + w_{DD} p_t^2}{\\bar{w}_t} $$\n\nStep 4: Invasion Condition (Linear Stability Analysis)\nThe drive allele $D$ will invade the population if its frequency increases when it is rare. This corresponds to the fixed point $p=0$ (a population of only wildtype) being unstable. The stability is determined by the per-generation growth factor, $\\lambda$, evaluated at $p_t=0$. This factor is the derivative of the recurrence relation for $p_t$ with respect to $p_t$, evaluated at $p_t=0$.\nLet $p_{t+1} = f(p_t)$. The invasion condition is $\\lambda = f'(0)  1$.\nTo compute this derivative, we first find the linear approximations for the numerator and denominator of $f(p_t)$ for small $p_t$.\nThe numerator $N(p_t) = p_t(1-p_t)(1-s)(1+h) + w_{DD} p_t^2$.\nTo first order in $p_t$, $N(p_t) \\approx p_t(1)(1-s)(1+h) + O(p_t^2) = p_t(1-s)(1+h)$.\nThe denominator $\\bar{w}_t = (1-p_t)^2 + 2p_t(1-p_t)(1-s) + w_{DD} p_t^2$.\nTo first order in $p_t$, $\\bar{w}_t \\approx (1-2p_t) + 2p_t(1)(1-s) + O(p_t^2) = 1 - 2p_t + 2p_t - 2sp_t = 1 - 2sp_t$.\nSo, for $p_t \\ll 1$:\n$$ p_{t+1} \\approx \\frac{p_t(1-s)(1+h)}{1-2sp_t} \\approx p_t(1-s)(1+h)(1+2sp_t) $$\nExpanding this and keeping only terms up to first order in $p_t$:\n$$ p_{t+1} \\approx p_t(1-s)(1+h) $$\nThe growth factor is the ratio $\\frac{p_{t+1}}{p_t}$:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{p_{t+1}}{p_t} \\approx (1-s)(1+h) $$\nThis linear approximation is equivalent to the formal derivative $f'(0)$.\nThe drive invades if and only if its frequency grows, which means $\\lambda  1$. Thus, the condition for invasion is:\n$$ (1-s)(1+h)  1 $$\n\nStep 5: Derivation of Minimal Homing Efficiency $h^*(s)$\nThe minimal homing efficiency for invasion, $h^*(s)$, is the threshold value of $h$ at which the growth factor is exactly $1$. This defines the boundary between the parameter region where the drive is eliminated and where it invades. We solve for $h$ in the equation:\n$$ (1-s)(1+h) = 1 $$\nSince $s \\in [0,1)$, $1-s  0$, we can divide by it:\n$$ 1+h = \\frac{1}{1-s} $$\n$$ h = \\frac{1}{1-s} - 1 $$\n$$ h = \\frac{1 - (1-s)}{1-s} $$\n$$ h = \\frac{s}{1-s} $$\nTherefore, the minimal homing efficiency required for invasion is $h^*(s) = \\frac{s}{1-s}$. Invasion occurs if $h  h^*(s)$.\n\nFor invasion to be biologically possible, the required minimal efficiency $h^*(s)$ must not exceed its theoretical maximum of $1$. The condition is $h^*(s) \\le 1$:\n$$ \\frac{s}{1-s} \\le 1 $$\nSince $s \\in [0,1)$, $1-s$ is positive, so we can multiply without changing the inequality:\n$$ s \\le 1-s $$\n$$ 2s \\le 1 $$\n$$ s \\le \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThis shows that if the viability cost $s$ to the heterozygote is greater than $\\frac{1}{2}$, invasion is impossible even with perfect homing ($h=1$), because the drive's transmission advantage cannot overcome the selective disadvantage. For any $s \\le \\frac{1}{2}$, there exists a range of homing efficiencies $h \\in (\\frac{s}{1-s}, 1]$ that will lead to invasion. The question asks for the single analytic expression for $h^*(s)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{s}{1-s}}$$", "id": "2766801"}, {"introduction": "Decision-making in biotechnology is rarely static; it must adapt as new information becomes available.

It is not directly given, but we can derive it from the specificity. The events $T^{+}$ and $T^{-}$ are complementary for a given state. Therefore, for the state $\\neg H$:\n$$ P(T^{+} \\mid \\neg H) + P(T^{-} \\mid \\neg H) = 1 $$\nSo, the false positive rate is:\n$$ P(T^{+} \\mid \\neg H) = 1 - P(T^{-} \\mid \\neg H) = 1 - \\text{specificity} $$\nSubstituting these definitions into Bayes' theorem gives the final expression in terms of the specified quantities:\n$$ P(H \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{(\\text{sensitivity}) \\cdot p_{0}}{(\\text{sensitivity}) \\cdot p_{0} + (1 - \\text{specificity}) \\cdot (1 - p_{0})} $$\nThis is the derived analytical expression.
