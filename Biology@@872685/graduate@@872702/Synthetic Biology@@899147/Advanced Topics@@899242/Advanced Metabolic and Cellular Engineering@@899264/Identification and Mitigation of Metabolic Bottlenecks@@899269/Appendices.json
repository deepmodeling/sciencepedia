The fundamental relationship is given as:\n$$\n\\Delta G = \\Delta G^{\\circ}{}' + RT \\ln Q\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G^{\\circ}{}'$ is the standard transformed Gibbs free energy change, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $Q$ is the reaction quotient.

The standard transformed free energy is related to the equilibrium constant, $K_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, by:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ}{}' = -RT \\ln K_{\\mathrm{eq}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Delta G$ yields a more direct formula for the driving force:\n$$\n\\Delta G = -RT \\ln K_{\\mathrm{eq}} + RT \\ln Q = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{Q}{K_{\\mathrm{eq}}}\\right)\n$$\nWe are given $R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, $T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and $K_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 1.5$.

The thermodynamic driving force has increased in magnitude.\n\nThe second task is to determine the fold-change in net reaction flux, $J_1/J_0$. The problem states the reaction is elementary and reversible, following mass-action kinetics. For $X \\underset{k_r}{\\stackrel{k_f}{\\rightleftharpoons}} Y$, the forward rate is $v_f = k_f[X]$ and the reverse rate is $v_r = k_r[Y]$. The net flux $J$ is the difference:\n$$\nJ = v_f - v_r = k_f[X] - k_r[Y]\n$$\nAt equilibrium, $J=0$, which implies $k_f[X]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = k_r[Y]_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. The equilibrium constant is $K_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{[Y]_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{[X]_{\\mathrm{eq}}}$. From the kinetic definition of equilibrium, we find the relationship between the rate constants and the equilibrium constant:\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{k_f}{k_r}\n$$\nWe can use this to eliminate one of the unknown rate constants from the flux equation.

Since the enzyme properties are unchanged, $k_f$ and $k_r$ (and thus $K_{\\mathrm{eq}}$) are constant between the two states.

The unknown constant $k_f$ cancels:\n$$\n\\frac{J_1}{J_0} = \\frac{k_f \\left( [X]_1 - \\frac{[Y]_1}{K_{\\mathrm{eq}}} \\right)}{k_f \\left( [X]_0 - \\frac{[Y]_0}{K_{\\mathrm{eq}}} \\right)} = \\frac{[X]_1 - \\frac{[Y]_1}{K_{\\mathrm{eq}}}}{[X]_0 - \\frac{[Y]_0}{K_{\\mathrm{eq}}}}\n$$\nWe substitute the given numerical values: $[X]_0 = 0.80$, $[Y]_0 = 1.00$, $[X]_1 = 1.00$, $[Y]_1 = 0.90$, and $K_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 1.5$.

Let $v_{3} = v$ for some $v  0$. This implies a steady-state flux vector $\\mathbf{v} = [v, v, v, v]^T$. All reactions are specified as irreversible in the forward direction except for $R_2$. A flux vector with all positive components is consistent with the reaction directions. The uptake flux $v_{\\text{in}}$ is unbounded from above. Therefore, any flux vector $\\mathbf{v} = [v, v, v, v]^T$ with $v  0$ is a valid solution in the FBA framework.\n**Conclusion for Task 1:** FBA alone can admit a nonzero flux to $P_{\\text{ext}}$.\n\n**Task 2: Thermodynamic Feasibility**\nFor the pathway to operate in the forward direction, all reactions must have a non-positive Gibbs free energy change ($\\Delta G_{j} \\leq 0$). We examine the reaction $R_2$, which has a large positive standard Gibbs energy.\nThe reaction is $R_{2}: Y \\rightleftharpoons Z$. The Gibbs energy change is $\\Delta G_{2} = \\Delta G_{2}^{\\circ\\prime} + RT \\ln([Z]/[Y])$.\nFor a forward flux $v_{2}  0$, we require $\\Delta G_{2} \\leq 0$:\n$$ +25\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} + (2.478\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{[Z]}{[Y]}\\right) \\leq 0 $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{[Z]}{[Y]}\\right) \\leq -\\frac{25}{2.478} \\approx -10.089 $$\n$$ \\frac{[Z]}{[Y]} \\leq e^{-10.089} \\approx 4.15 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nThis inequality specifies the required ratio of product to substrate concentration for the reaction to be spontaneous in the forward direction.\nWe must now verify if this ratio is attainable within the given physiological concentration bounds: $[Y] \\in [10^{-6}\\,\\text{M}, 10^{-2}\\,\\text{M}]$ and $[Z] \\in [10^{-6}\\,\\text{M}, 10^{-2}\\,\\text{M}]$.\nTo minimize the ratio $[Z]/[Y]$, we must select the minimum possible concentration of $Z$ and the maximum possible concentration of $Y$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{[Z]}{[Y]}\\right)_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{[Z]_{\\text{min}}}{[Y]_{\\text{max}}} = \\frac{10^{-6}\\,\\text{M}}{10^{-2}\\,\\text{M}} = 10^{-4} $$\nComparing the minimum achievable ratio with the required ratio:\nThe minimum achievable ratio is $10^{-4} = 1 \\times 10^{-4}$. The required ratio is $\\leq 4.15 \\times 10^{-5}$.\nSince $1 \\times 10^{-4}  4.15 \\times 10^{-5}$, the condition for thermodynamic feasibility can never be met. The minimum possible value for $\\Delta G_2$ is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{2, \\text{min}} = 25 + 2.478 \\ln(10^{-4}) \\approx 25 - 22.82 = +2.18\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} $$\nSince $\\Delta G_{2, \\text{min}}  0$, the forward reaction $Y \\rightarrow Z$ is thermodynamically forbidden under all possible concentration values within the specified bounds.\n**Conclusion for Task 2:** $R_2$ constitutes a severe thermodynamic bottleneck. A nonzero forward flux is thermodynamically infeasible, which contradicts the FBA result.\n\n**Task 3: Evaluation of Interventions**\nWe evaluate each option for its ability to make $v_3  0$ feasible under both stoichiometry and thermodynamics, which requires resolving the thermodynamic infeasibility of $R_2$.\n\n**A. Replace $R_{2}$ with an ATP-coupled step.**\nThe new reaction is $Y + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow Z + \\text{ADP} + \\text{P}_{\\text{i}}$. The standard Gibbs energy is the sum of the individual reactions:\n$$ \\Delta G_{2', \\text{new}}^{\\circ\\prime} = \\Delta G_{2}^{\\circ\\prime} + \\Delta G_{\\text{hydrolysis}}^{\\circ\\prime} = +25\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} + (-30.5\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}) = -5.5\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} $$\nThe new standard Gibbs energy is negative. The feasibility condition is $\\Delta G_{2'} \\leq 0$.\n$$ \\Delta G_{2'} = -5.5 + RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[Z][\\text{ADP}][\\text{P}_{\\text{i}}]}{[Y][\\text{ATP}]}\\right) \\leq 0 $$\nAssuming for simplicity that the cellular energy charge term $\\frac{[\\text{ADP}][\\text{P}_{\\text{i}}]}{[\\text{ATP}]}$ does not prevent feasibility, the condition on the metabolite concentrations is significantly relaxed. If we assume the energy charge term is unity for analysis, we need:\n$$ -5.5 + RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[Z]}{[Y]}\\right) \\leq 0 \\implies \\ln\\left(\\frac{[Z]}{[Y]}\\right) \\leq \\frac{5.5}{2.478} \\approx 2.22 \\implies \\frac{[Z]}{[Y]} \\leq 9.2 $$\nThe achievable range for $[Z]/[Y]$ is $[10^{-4}, 10^4]$. The condition $[Z]/[Y] \\leq 9.2$ can be satisfied for a wide range of concentrations. Thus, ATP coupling makes the reaction thermodynamically feasible.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Overexpress the enzyme catalyzing $R_{2}$.**\nEnzymes are biological catalysts. They increase the rate at which a reaction approaches equilibrium by lowering the activation energy. However, they do not alter the equilibrium constant or the overall Gibbs free energy change ($\\Delta G$) of the reaction. Since reaction $R_2$ is thermodynamically forbidden ($\\Delta G_2  0$), increasing the enzyme concentration will not make it spontaneous.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Add a high-capacity exporter for $Z$ and sequestration for $Y$.**\nThis intervention alters the achievable concentrations to $[Z] \\approx 10^{-8}\\,\\text{M}$ and $[Y] \\approx 10^{-2}\\,\\text{M}$. We must check if the original thermodynamic constraint for $R_2$ is satisfied under these new conditions. The new concentration ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{[Z]}{[Y]} \\approx \\frac{10^{-8}\\,\\text{M}}{10^{-2}\\,\\text{M}} = 10^{-6} $$\nThe condition for feasibility remains $[Z]/[Y] \\leq 4.15 \\times 10^{-5}$.\nSince $10^{-6}  4.15 \\times 10^{-5}$, the condition is now satisfied. The Gibbs energy under these conditions is:\n$$ \\Delta G_2 = 25 + 2.478 \\ln(10^{-6}) \\approx 25 + 2.478(-13.82) = 25 - 34.24 \\approx -9.24\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} $$\nWith $\\Delta G_2  0$, the reaction becomes feasible.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**D. Impose a positive lower bound $v_{2} \\geq 1$ in FBA.**\nThis is an artificial modification of the mathematical model. Imposing a constraint on a flux variable in a computational model does not alter the underlying biophysical laws governing the system. The reaction remains thermodynamically forbidden, meaning a flux of $v_2 \\ge 1$ is physically impossible. This intervention produces a physically meaningless FBA solution and does not resolve the actual bottleneck.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Swap the enzyme for a variant with $\\Delta G_{2}^{\\circ\\prime}$ decreased by $10\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$.**\nThis intervention, via protein engineering, changes the standard Gibbs energy of the reaction. The new value is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{2, \\text{new}}^{\\circ\\prime} = +25\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} - 10\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} = +15\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} $$\nThe new feasibility condition is $\\Delta G_2 \\leq 0$:\n$$ +15 + RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[Z]}{[Y]}\\right) \\leq 0 \\implies \\ln\\left(\\frac{[Z]}{[Y]}\\right) \\leq -\\frac{15}{2.478} \\approx -6.053 $$\n$$ \\frac{[Z]}{[Y]} \\leq e^{-6.053} \\approx 2.35 \\times 10^{-3} $$\nThe minimum achievable ratio with the original concentration bounds is $([Z]/[Y])_{\\text{min}} = 10^{-4}$.\nSince $10^{-4}  2.35 \\times 10^{-3}$, there exists a range of achievable concentrations (specifically, when $[Z]/[Y] \\leq 2.35 \\times 10^{-3}$) where the reaction is thermodynamically feasible. For instance, at the minimum ratio:\n$$ \\Delta G_2 = 15 + 2.478 \\ln(10^{-4}) \\approx 15 - 22.82 = -7.82\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} $$\nThis intervention makes the reaction feasible.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2745889"}]}
