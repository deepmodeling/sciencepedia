Let $T$ denote $\\text{target}$ and $N$ denote $\\text{non-target}$.\n\n$1.$ **Seed pairing category ($m$):** This is a discrete categorical feature. The $LLR$ is computed directly from the provided conditional probabilities.\n$$ LLR_m = \\log\\left(\\frac{P(m \\mid T)}{P(m \\mid N)}\\right) $$\n\n$2.$ **$3^{\\prime}$ supplementary pairing count ($k$):** This is modeled by a Poisson distribution, $P(k; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}$.\n$$ LLR_k = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\frac{\\lambda_T^k e^{-\\lambda_T}}{k!}}{\\frac{\\lambda_N^k e^{-\\lambda_N}}{k!}}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_T}{\\lambda_N}\\right)^k e^{-(\\lambda_T - \\lambda_N)}\\right) = k \\log\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_T}{\\lambda_N}\\right) - (\\lambda_T - \\lambda_N) $$\nGiven $\\lambda_T = 3.5$ and $\\lambda_N = 1.0$.\n\n$3.$ **Site accessibility ($\\Delta G_{\\text{open}}$):** This is modeled by a Gaussian (Normal) distribution, $f(x; \\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$. The standard deviations are equal, $\\sigma_T = \\sigma_N = \\sigma = 1.5$.\n$$ LLR_{\\Delta G} = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(\\Delta G_{\\text{open}}-\\mu_T)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(\\Delta G_{\\text{open}}-\\mu_N)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}}\\right) = \\frac{(\\Delta G_{\\text{open}}-\\mu_N)^2 - (\\Delta G_{\\text{open}}-\\mu_T)^2}{2\\sigma^2} $$\nExpanding the squares, we get a linear function of $\\Delta G_{\\text{open}}$:\n$$ LLR_{\\Delta G} = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\left[ 2\\Delta G_{\\text{open}}(\\mu_T - \\mu_N) + \\mu_N^2 - \\mu_T^2 \\right] $$\nGiven $\\mu_T = 4.0$, $\\mu_N = 6.5$, and $\\sigma = 1.5$.\n\n$4.$ **AU-rich context ($f_{\\text{AU}}$):** This is modeled by a Beta distribution, $f(x; \\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{x^{\\alpha-1}(1-x)^{\\beta-1}}{B(\\alpha, \\beta)}$, where $B(\\alpha, \\beta)$ is the Beta function.\n$$ LLR_{f_{\\text{AU}}} = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\frac{f_{\\text{AU}}^{\\alpha_T-1}(1-f_{\\text{AU}})^{\\beta_T-1}}{B(\\alpha_T, \\beta_T)}}{\\frac{f_{\\text{AU}}^{\\alpha_N-1}(1-f_{\\text{AU}})^{\\beta_N-1}}{B(\\alpha_N, \\beta_N)}}\\right) $$\n$$ LLR_{f_{\\text{AU}}} = (\\alpha_T - \\alpha_N)\\log(f_{\\text{AU}}) + (\\beta_T - \\beta_N)\\log(1-f_{\\text{AU}}) + \\log(B(\\alpha_N, \\beta_N)) - \\log(B(\\alpha_T, \\beta_T)) $$\nGiven $(\\alpha_T, \\beta_T) = (4,2)$ and $(\\alpha_N, \\beta_N) = (2,4)$. The Beta function can be computed using Gamma functions: $B(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\Gamma(\\beta)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta)}$, and its logarithm as $\\log B(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\log\\Gamma(\\alpha) + \\log\\Gamma(\\beta) - \\log\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta)$.\n\n$5.$ **Conservation fraction ($c$):** This is also modeled by a Beta distribution. The form of the $LLR_c$ is identical to $LLR_{f_{\\text{AU}}}$, but with its own parameters.\n$$ LLR_c = (\\alpha_T - \\alpha_N)\\log(c) + (\\beta_T - \\beta_N)\\log(1-c) + \\log(B(\\alpha_N, \\beta_N)) - \\log(B(\\alpha_T, \\beta_T)) $$\nGiven $(\\alpha_T, \\beta_T) = (6, 1.5)$ and $(\\alpha_N, \\beta_N) = (1.5, 6)$.\n\nThe total log-posterior odds score $S$ is the sum of the log-prior odds and these five $LLR$ terms.\n$$ S = \\log\\left(\\frac{0.05}{0.95}\\right) + LLR_m + LLR_k + LLR_{\\Delta G} + LLR_{f_{\\text{AU}}} + LLR_c $$\nFinally, to obtain the posterior probability $P(T=\\text{target} \\mid \\vec{x})$, we apply the logistic (sigmoid) function, which is the inverse of the logit function:\n$$ P(T=\\text{target} \\mid \\vec{x}) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-S}} $$\nThis provides the quantitative prediction required.
