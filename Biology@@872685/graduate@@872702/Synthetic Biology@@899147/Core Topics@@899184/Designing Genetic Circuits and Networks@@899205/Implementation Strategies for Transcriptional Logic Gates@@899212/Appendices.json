The assumptions, such as steric hindrance, cooperative binding, and thermodynamic equilibrium, are standard and biophysically realistic approximations used to model gene regulation. The problem is free of pseudoscience.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

The constraints are sufficient to yield a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. All terms are defined, and the tasks are unambiguous.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or vagueness. It represents a standard, formalizable problem in statistical thermodynamics as applied to molecular biology.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will now be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first enumerating all possible microscopic states (microstates) of the promoter and their corresponding statistical weights, as dictated by the principles of statistical mechanics. The probability of any macroscopic state, such as the promoter being bound by RNAP, is the sum of the weights of all microstates consistent with that macroscopic state, divided by the partition function, which is the sum of the weights of all possible microstates.\n\nLet the state of the promoter be represented by the set of bound molecules. The empty promoter is our reference state with a statistical weight of $1$.\n\nThe possible microstates and their statistical weights are as follows, where we use the notation $[X]/K_X$ for the concentration-dependent part of the weight for molecule $X$:\n1.  **Empty state ($\\emptyset$)**: The promoter is unoccupied.\n    Weight: $W_{\\emptyset} = 1$.\n2.  **A bound**: Activator $A$ is bound alone.\n    Weight: $W_A = [A]/K_A$.\n3.  **R bound**: Repressor $R$ is bound alone.\n    Weight: $W_R = [R]/K_R$.\n4.  **P bound**: RNAP $P$ is bound alone.\n    Weight: $W_P = [P]/K_P$.\n5.  **A and R bound**: Since their binding is independent, the weight is the product of their individual weights.\n    Weight: $W_{AR} = ([A]/K_A) \\times ([R]/K_R)$.\n6.  **A and P bound**: These molecules bind cooperatively with an interaction factor $\\omega_{AP}$.\n    Weight: $W_{AP} = ([A]/K_A) \\times ([P]/K_P) \\times \\omega_{AP}$.\n7.  **R and P bound**: This state is forbidden due to steric exclusion.\n    Weight: $W_{RP} = 0$.\n8.  **A, R, and P bound**: This state is also forbidden, as it requires $R$ and $P$ to be co-bound.\n    Weight: $W_{ARP} = 0$.\n\nThe partition function, $Z$, is the sum of the statistical weights of all possible states:\n$$Z = W_{\\emptyset} + W_A + W_R + W_P + W_{AR} + W_{AP}$$\n$$Z = 1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_A} + \\frac{[R]}{K_R} + \\frac{[P]}{K_P} + \\frac{[A]}{K_A}\\frac{[R]}{K_R} + \\omega_{AP}\\frac{[A]}{K_A}\\frac{[P]}{K_P}$$\n\nThe probability that RNAP is bound to the promoter, $p_{\\mathrm{bound}}$, is the ratio of the sum of weights of states containing $P$ to the total partition function $Z$. The states containing $P$ are the 'P bound' and 'A and P bound' states.\n\n$$p_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\frac{W_P + W_{AP}}{Z}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the weights and the partition function, we obtain the exact expression for the RNAP promoter occupancy:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\frac{\\frac{[P]}{K_P} + \\omega_{AP}\\frac{[A]}{K_A}\\frac{[P]}{K_P}}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_A} + \\frac{[R]}{K_R} + \\frac{[P]}{K_P} + \\frac{[A]}{K_A}\\frac{[R]}{K_R} + \\omega_{AP}\\frac{[A]}{K_A}\\frac{[P]}{K_P}}$$\nThe numerator can be factored to complete the first task:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\frac{\\frac{[P]}{K_P} \\left(1 + \\omega_{AP}\\frac{[A]}{K_A}\\right)}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_A} + \\frac{[R]}{K_R} + \\frac{[P]}{K_P} + \\frac{[A]}{K_A}\\frac{[R]}{K_R} + \\omega_{AP}\\frac{[A]}{K_A}\\frac{[P]}{K_P}}$$\nThis is the exact expression for the probability of RNAP binding.\n\nFor the second task, we apply the weak-RNAP-binding limit, which is stated as $[P]/K_P \\ll 1$. In this limit, all terms in the denominator containing the factor $[P]/K_P$ are negligible compared to terms that do not, provided that the activities of $A$ and $R$ are not pathologically small. We can therefore approximate the partition function $Z$ by a reduced form, $Z'$, which omits these terms:\n$$Z \\approx Z' = 1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_A} + \\frac{[R]}{K_R} + \\frac{[A]}{K_A}\\frac{[R]}{K_R}$$\nThis reduced denominator $Z'$ can be factored:\n$$Z' = \\left(1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_A}\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{[R]}{K_R}\\right)$$\nThe numerator of the expression for $p_{\\mathrm{bound}}$ already contains the factor $[P]/K_P$, so it is of the correct small order and must be retained. Therefore, the reduced expression for $p_{\\mathrm{bound}}$ in this limit is:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{bound}} \\approx \\frac{\\frac{[P]}{K_P} \\left(1 + \\omega_{AP}\\frac{[A]}{K_A}\\right)}{\\left(1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_A}\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{[R]}{K_R}\\right)}$$\nThis expression is a Hill-like form. The dependence on the activator concentration $[A]$ and repressor concentration $[R]$ is through rational functions with effective Hill coefficients of unity. The term $(1 + \\omega_{AP}[A]/K_A)$ in the numerator reflects activation, where binding of $A$ enhances the effective affinity of $P$. The term $(1 + [R]/K_R)$ in the denominator reflects repression, where binding of $R$ sequesters the promoter, making it unavailable for $P$. The term $(1 + [A]/K_A)$ in the denominator reflects the fact that activator, even when not promoting RNAP binding, still occupies the promoter and thus competes with the RNAP-activator complex.\n\nThis completes the derivation.

The system is modeled using the Shea-Ackers framework, where the probability of a promoter's microstate is proportional to its statistical weight, determined by the law of mass action. The total transcriptional output is the weighted average of the activity of each state.\n\nLet us first analyze the $1$-site architecture. The promoter has a single operator site to which the repressor transcription factor (TF) can bind. There are two possible states for this system:\n$1$. The operator site is unbound. We denote this state by $S_0$. The number of bound repressors is $n=0$. The transcriptional activity multiplier is $\\eta^0 = 1$.

The activity multiplier is $\\eta^1 = \\eta$. The equilibrium for the binding reaction $TF + Site \\rightleftharpoons TF \\cdot Site$ is described by the dissociation constant $K_d = \\frac{[TF][Site]}{[TF \\cdot Site]}$.
