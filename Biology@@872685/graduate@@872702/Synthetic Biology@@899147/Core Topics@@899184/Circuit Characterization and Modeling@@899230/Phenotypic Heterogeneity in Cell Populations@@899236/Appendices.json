It describes a standard problem in quantitative biology with realistic parameters. All information required for a solution is provided.

Both steps are inherently stochastic, contributing to cell-to-cell variability in protein numbers, $X$. We must determine whether noise from transcription or translation is dominant.\n\nLet us consider the two possibilities presented:\nHypothesis A: The dominant noise source is \"translation shot noise\". This term describes the stochasticity inherent in the synthesis and degradation of individual protein molecules. If the mRNA template concentration were stable and non-fluctuating, protein synthesis would be a simple birth-death process. According to the foundational principles given, such a process, if Poissonian, results in a protein distribution where the variance is equal to the mean.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\langle X \\rangle\n$$\nThis corresponds to a Fano factor, defined as $F \\equiv \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(X)}{\\langle X \\rangle}$, equal to $1$.\n\nHypothesis B: The dominant noise source is \"transcriptional bursting\". This implies that the transcription process itself is highly intermittent. The gene promoter stochastically switches between an active state, producing mRNA molecules in bursts, and an inactive state. This leads to large, sporadic fluctuations in mRNA copy number. These upstream fluctuations in the mRNA template are then transmitted and amplified during translation, resulting in a protein distribution that is \"overdispersed\"—meaning its variance is substantially larger than its mean.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(X) \\gg \\langle X \\rangle\n$$\nThis corresponds to a Fano factor $F \\gg 1$.\n\nNow, we evaluate these hypotheses against the experimental data. The measured mean is $\\langle X \\rangle = 100$ and the variance is $\\mathrm{Var}(X) = 5000$.\nLet us calculate the Fano factor for the observed protein distribution:\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(X)}{\\langle X \\rangle} = \\frac{5000}{100} = 50\n$$\nOur result is $F = 50$. This value is substantially greater than $1$. The variance is $50$ times larger than the mean.\n\nComparing this result to our hypotheses:\n- Hypothesis A predicts $F=1$. The data show $F=50$. This is a severe discrepancy. Therefore, the data strongly contradict the hypothesis that translation shot noise from a stable mRNA pool is the dominant contributor to heterogeneity.\n- Hypothesis B predicts $F \\gg 1$. The data show $F=50$, which is consistent with this prediction. The observation that $\\mathrm{Var}(X)$ dramatically exceeds $\\langle X \\rangle$ is the classic hallmark of bursty gene expression, where the primary source of noise is the stochastic production of mRNA.\n\nConclusion: The large observed variance relative to the mean is incompatible with a simple Poisson model of protein production. It is, however, the direct signature of a burst-like production mechanism. The large fluctuations must originate upstream of translation. Therefore, transcriptional bursting is the more plausible dominant contributor to the observed phenotypic heterogeneity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5}\n$$", "id": "2759682"}, {"introduction": "While experimental data provides snapshots of heterogeneity, mathematical modeling allows us to predict it from first principles.

The detector is in its linear regime, and a constant optical background exists due to dark current and out-of-focus light. Additionally, because a single global segmentation parameter was used for all images, each per-cell mean cytoplasmic intensity is scaled by the same unknown multiplicative factor. Finally, there is additive zero-mean acquisition noise independent of the biological signal. To correct bias and recover the population mean of the true cytoplasmic fluorescence, you performed two calibrations:\n\n1. Background offset calibration: you measured the mean per-pixel intensity in the cytoplasmic channel over blank regions with no cells, obtaining the following six independent readings (arbitrary fluorescence units, a.u.): $101.2$, $102.7$, $103.1$, $102.0$, $103.5$, $101.8$.\n\n2.
