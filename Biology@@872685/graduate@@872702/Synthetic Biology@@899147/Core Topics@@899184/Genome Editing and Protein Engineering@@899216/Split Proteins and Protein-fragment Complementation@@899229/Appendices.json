It describes a standard bimolecular binding equilibrium, a fundamental concept in physical chemistry and biochemistry. The model is based on the law of mass action and conservation of mass, which are core principles. The assumptions provided (ideal solution, $1{:}1$ stoichiometry, no side reactions) are standard simplifications for creating a tractable analytical model. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary parameters ($A_T$, $B_T$, $K_d$) defined to find the requested quantity ($f_A$). The constraints are physically consistent. No flaws listed in the validation criteria are present.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe reconstitution of the functional complex $C$ from fragments $A$ and $B$ is represented by the equilibrium reaction:\n$$\nA + B \\rightleftharpoons C\n$$\nFor a system at equilibrium, the dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action. It is more convenient to consider the dissociation reaction $C \\rightleftharpoons A + B$. The expression for $K_d$ is:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{[A][B]}{[C]}\n$$\nwhere $[A]$, $[B]$, and $[C]$ represent the equilibrium concentrations of the free fragments $A$, free fragments $B$, and the complex $C$, respectively.\n\nThe total concentrations of species $A$ and $B$, denoted $A_T$ and $B_T$, are conserved. These are expressed by the mass balance equations:\n$$\nA_T = [A] + [C]\n$$\n$$\nB_T = [B] + [C]\n$$\nFrom these conservation laws, we can express the free concentrations $[A]$ and $[B]$ in terms of the total concentrations and the concentration of the complex $[C]$:\n$$\n[A] = A_T - [C]\n$$\n$$\n[B] = B_T - [C]\n$$\nThese expressions are valid because the concentration of a component in a complex cannot exceed its total concentration, which means $[C] \\le A_T$ and $[C] \\le B_T$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions for the free concentrations into the equation for the dissociation constant yields:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{(A_T - [C])(B_T - [C])}{[C]}\n$$\nTo solve for $[C]$, we rearrange this equation into a polynomial form. Multiplying both sides by $[C]$ gives:\n$$\nK_d [C] = (A_T - [C])(B_T - [C])\n$$\nExpanding the product on the right-hand side:\n$$\nK_d [C] = A_T B_T - A_T [C] - B_T [C] + [C]^2\n$$\nCollecting all terms on one side results in a standard quadratic equation for $[C]$:\n$$\n[C]^2 - (A_T + B_T + K_d)[C] + A_T B_T = 0\n$$\nThis equation is of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, with $x = [C]$, $a = 1$, $b = -(A_T + B_T + K_d)$, and $c = A_T B_T$. The solution is given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\n[C] = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n$$\nSubstituting the coefficients:\n$$\n[C] = \\frac{(A_T + B_T + K_d) \\pm \\sqrt{(-(A_T + B_T + K_d))^2 - 4(1)(A_T B_T)}}{2(1)}\n$$\n$$\n[C] = \\frac{(A_T + B_T + K_d) \\pm \\sqrt{(A_T + B_T + K_d)^2 - 4A_T B_T}}{2}\n$$\nThe quadratic equation yields two mathematical solutions, but only one is physically valid. To identify the correct root, we examine the behavior under a limiting condition. Let us consider the case where the total concentration of fragment $B$ is zero, $B_T = 0$. In this scenario, no complex $C$ can be formed, so we must have $[C] = 0$.\nSubstituting $B_T = 0$ into the solution for $[C]$:\n$$\n[C] = \\frac{(A_T + K_d) \\pm \\sqrt{(A_T + K_d)^2 - 0}}{2} = \\frac{(A_T + K_d) \\pm (A_T + K_d)}{2}\n$$\nThe solution with the plus sign gives $[C] = \\frac{2(A_T + K_d)}{2} = A_T + K_d$. This result is unphysical, as $[C]$ must be zero.\nThe solution with the minus sign gives $[C] = \\frac{(A_T + K_d) - (A_T + K_d)}{2} = 0$. This result is consistent with the physical expectation.\nTherefore, the negative sign in the quadratic formula provides the physically meaningful solution for all valid parameter values. The correct expression for the equilibrium concentration of the complex is:\n$$\n[C] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (A_T + B_T + K_d) - \\sqrt{(A_T + B_T + K_d)^2 - 4 A_T B_T} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the fraction of fragment $A$ that is incorporated into the complex, defined as $f_A \\equiv [C]/A_T$. We obtain this by dividing the expression for $[C]$ by $A_T$:\n$$\nf_A = \\frac{[C]}{A_T} = \\frac{(A_T + B_T + K_d) - \\sqrt{(A_T + B_T + K_d)^2 - 4 A_T B_T}}{2 A_T}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for $f_A$ as a function of $A_T$, $B_T$, and $K_d$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{(A_T + B_T + K_d) - \\sqrt{(A_T + B_T + K_d)^2 - 4 A_T B_T}}{2 A_T}}$$", "id": "2774885"}, {"introduction": "This practice explores a common design strategy: tethering fragments with a flexible linker to enhance their association rate.

Second, we calculate its numerical value using the provided parameters.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of $k_{\\mathrm{intra}}$\n\nThe effective molarity, $c_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, represents the concentration of a free reactant required to achieve the same reaction rate as the corresponding intramolecular process. It is defined by the relation $k_{\\mathrm{intra}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}c_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, where $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is the second-order rate constant of the bimolecular reaction and $k_{\\mathrm{intra}}$ is the first-order rate constant of the intramolecular reaction.\n\nWe derive $c_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ by equating the probability of finding the reactive fragments within a defined interaction volume for both the intramolecular and an equivalent intermolecular system. Let the capture volume be $V_{cap}$, which is a sphere of radius $a$.\n\nIn the intramolecular case, a single molecule contains both fragments $A$ and $B$, tethered by a linker. The probability of finding fragment $B$ within the capture volume $V_{cap}$ centered on fragment $A$ is given by the integral of the end-to-end probability density function $p(\\mathbf{r})$ over this volume:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{intra}} = \\int_{V_{cap}} p(\\mathbf{r}) dV\n$$\nIn the intermolecular case, we consider a solution of free fragments $A$ and $B$. For a given fragment $A$, the average number of fragments $B$ found within the capture volume $V_{cap}$ depends on the molar concentration of $B$, which we will set to $c_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The number density of $B$ molecules is $c_{\\mathrm{eff}} N_A$. The average number of $B$ molecules in the volume $V_{cap}$ is:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{inter}} = c_{\\mathrm{eff}} N_A V_{cap}\n$$\nThe effective molarity $c_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is defined as the concentration for which this average number of molecules equals the probability $P_{\\mathrm{intra}}$ for the tethered system.

The definition is:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\equiv \\left.\\frac{d}{d\\ln c}\\,\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{p(c)}{1 - p(c)}\\right)\\right|_{p=1/2}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the ratio $\\frac{p(c)}{1 - p(c)}$.\n$$\n1 - p(c) = 1 - \\frac{W_C}{1 + W_C} = \\frac{1 + W_C - W_C}{1 + W_C} = \\frac{1}{1 + W_C}\n$$\nTherefore, the ratio is simply the Boltzmann weight of the complex state:\n$$\n\\frac{p(c)}{1 - p(c)} = \\frac{W_C / (1 + W_C)}{1 / (1 + W_C)} = W_C\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $W_C$:\n$$\n\\frac{p(c)}{1 - p(c)} = \\alpha_A \\alpha_B c^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^0}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nNow we must take the natural logarithm of this quantity:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{p(c)}{1 - p(c)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\alpha_A \\alpha_B c^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^0}{k_B T}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{p(c)}{1 - p(c)}\\right) = \\ln(\\alpha_A \\alpha_B) + \\ln(c^2) - \\frac{\\Delta G^0}{k_B T} = \\ln(\\alpha_A \\alpha_B) + 2\\ln(c) - \\frac{\\Delta G^0}{k_B T}\n$$\nFinally, we differentiate this expression with respect to $\\ln(c)$ to find $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. Let $u = \\ln(c)$. The expression becomes a simple derivative with respect to $u$:\n\\begin{align*}\nn_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{d}{d\\ln c}\\left(\\ln(\\alpha_A \\alpha_B) + 2\\ln(c) - \\frac{\\Delta G^0}{k_B T}\\right) \\\\\n= \\frac{d}{d\\ln c}\\left(\\ln(\\alpha_A \\alpha_B) - \\frac{\\Delta G^0}{k_B T}\\right) + \\frac{d}{d\\ln c}\\left(2\\ln(c)\\right)\n\\end{align*}\nThe terms $\\ln(\\alpha_A \\alpha_B)$ and $\\frac{\\Delta G^0}{k_B T}$ are constants with respect to $c$, so their derivative is zero.\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0 + 2 \\frac{d(\\ln c)}{d(\\ln c)} = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2\n$$\nThe result is a constant value of $2$. The definition of $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ includes an evaluation at the point where $p(c) = 1/2$. Since our derived quantity is a constant and does not depend on $c$ (and therefore not on the value of $p$), this evaluation does not change the result. The effective Hill exponent is $2$. This integer value reflects the stoichiometry of the association reaction, where two species ($A$ and $B$), whose activities both scale linearly with the input $c$, must come together to form the final complex.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "2774854"}]}
