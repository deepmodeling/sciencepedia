The module has a single measured output $y(t)$ driven by a known, externally imposed input $u(t)$.

The model $\\frac{dy}{dt} = k_{1}u(t) - k_{2}y(t)$ is a standard first-order linear time-invariant (LTI) system, a fundamental and widely used abstraction in all STEM fields, including synthetic biology for modeling processes such as protein concentration dynamics under constitutive expression and degradation. The concepts of steady-state analysis, input-output mapping, and structural identifiability are all well-established, rigorous principles in control theory and system identification. The problem is objective, quantitative, and self-contained. The assumptions of noiseless data and perfect inputs are standard for a *structural* identifiability analysis, which seeks to determine what parameters can be identified in principle, given perfect experimental conditions. The problem is therefore well-posed and does not violate any criteria for validity. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe analysis begins from the governing differential equation for the system module:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = k_{1}u(t) - k_{2}y(t)\n$$\nThe experimental protocol is restricted to steady-state measurements. By definition, a system is at steady state when its state variables are no longer changing with time. For this system, this condition implies that the time derivative of the output, $\\frac{dy}{dt}$, must be equal to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\n$$\nFurthermore, during a steady-state experiment, the input is held constant at some value $\\bar{u}$. Consequently, the output will also settle to a constant value, which we denote as $\\bar{y}$.\nSubstituting these conditions, $u(t) = \\bar{u}$ and $y(t) = \\bar{y}$, into the system's dynamic equation at steady state gives:\n$$\n0 = k_{1}\\bar{u} - k_{2}\\bar{y}\n$$\nThis algebraic equation describes the relationship between the experimentally controlled input $\\bar{u}$ and the measured output $\\bar{y}$ at steady state. This is the input-output (I/O) map under the specified experimental conditions.\n\nTo determine which parameters are identifiable, we must express the measurable quantity ($\\bar{y}$) as a function of the controlled quantity ($\\bar{u}$) and the unknown parameters ($k_{1}$, $k_{2}$). Rearranging the steady-state equation to solve for $\\bar{y}$:\n$$\nk_{2}\\bar{y} = k_{1}\\bar{u}\n$$\nSince the problem states that $k_{2} > 0$, we can safely divide by $k_{2}$ without risk of division by zero.\n$$\n\\bar{y} = \\left(\\frac{k_{1}}{k_{2}}\\right) \\bar{u}\n$$\nThis equation reveals that the steady-state output $\\bar{y}$ is directly proportional to the steady-state input $\\bar{u}$. The problem states that we can perform experiments for arbitrarily many distinct positive input levels $\\bar{u}$ and record the corresponding $\\bar{y}$. This is equivalent to being able to trace the function $\\bar{y}(\\bar{u})$. From the equation above, this function is a straight line passing through the origin with a constant slope.\n\nLet us define an experimentally measurable parameter, $P$, as the slope of the line relating $\\bar{y}$ to $\\bar{u}$.\n$$\nP = \\frac{\\bar{y}}{\\bar{u}}\n$$\nBy comparing this with the derived steady-state I/O map, we can equate this observable parameter $P$ to the combination of the unknown model parameters $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$.\n$$\nP = \\frac{k_{1}}{k_{2}}\n$$\nFrom the steady-state experiments, we can only determine the numerical value of $P$. The question of structural identifiability is whether we can uniquely determine the values of $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ from the value of $P$. We have one equation, $P = k_{1} / k_{2}$, and two unknowns, $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$. For any given measured value of $P$, there exists an infinite set of pairs $(k_{1}, k_{2})$ that satisfy this equation. For instance, if the experiment yields $P=5$, the true parameters could be $(k_{1}=5, k_{2}=1)$, or $(k_{1}=10, k_{2}=2)$, or any pair $(k_1, k_2) = (5c, c)$ for any constant $c > 0$. Therefore, the individual parameters $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ are not structurally identifiable from steady-state data alone.\n\nHowever, the *combination* of parameters that constitutes the slope, namely the ratio $\\frac{k_{1}}{k_{2}}$, is uniquely determined by the experiment. This specific grouping of parameters maps directly to an observable quantity. The problem asks for precisely this: the unique parameter combination that is structurally identifiable. This combination is the ratio of the production rate parameter to the degradation rate parameter.\n\nThus, the unique, structurally identifiable parameter combination, expressed as a closed-form analytic function of $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$, is their ratio.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{k_{1}}{k_{2}}}\n$$", "id": "2734577"}, {"introduction": "The principle of modularity envisions biological parts as components that can be connected without altering their intrinsic properties, much like electronic components.

Our goal is to find an expression for $y$ in terms of the parameters $Y_T$, $P_T$, and $K_d$.\n\nWe begin by expressing the unknown concentrations $p$ and $c$ in terms of $y$ and the known parameters using the conservation equations.\nFrom equation ($2$), we isolate $c$:\n$$c = Y_T - y$$\nNext, we substitute this expression for $c$ into equation ($3$):\n$$P_T = p + (Y_T - y)$$\nSolving for $p$ yields:\n$$p = P_T - Y_T + y$$\nNow we have both $p$ and $c$ expressed in terms of $y$.
