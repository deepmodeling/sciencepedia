A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two characteristic lengths in diffraction-limited microscopy and their subsequent ratio.

The descriptions of shot noise (Poisson statistics), read noise (Gaussian), and the principle of adding independent noise sources in quadrature are fundamental and correct concepts in the physics of electronic imaging sensors like CCDs. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters ($S$, $r$, and the number of pixels) to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio for both specified modes. The terminology is precise and objective. There are no contradictions, missing information, or pseudoscientific claims. The problem is a standard, albeit simplified, exercise in signal processing for scientific imaging.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will now be derived.\n\nWe will analyze the two acquisition modes separately, starting from the given principles. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is defined as:\n$$ \\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{\\langle I \\rangle}{\\sigma_{I}} $$\nwhere $\\langle I \\rangle$ is the mean signal and $\\sigma_{I}$ is the standard deviation of the total noise associated with that signal.\n\nThe total signal over the $2 \\times 2$ region is $S = 10{,}000$ photoelectrons. As this signal is uniformly distributed over $4$ pixels, the mean signal per pixel, $S_p$, is:\n$$ S_p = \\frac{S}{4} = \\frac{10{,}000}{4} = 2{,}500~\\text{photoelectrons} $$\n\nThe total noise variance for a single pixel measurement, $\\sigma_p^2$, is the sum of the shot noise variance and the read noise variance, as these are independent sources.\n- Shot noise variance, $\\sigma_{\\text{shot}}^2$, follows Poisson statistics, so it is equal to the mean signal: $\\sigma_{\\text{shot}, p}^2 = S_p$.\n- Read noise variance, $\\sigma_{r}^2$, is given by the square of the RMS value: $\\sigma_{r}^2 = r^2$.\nThus, the total noise variance for a single pixel is:\n$$ \\sigma_p^2 = \\sigma_{\\text{shot}, p}^2 + \\sigma_{r}^2 = S_p + r^2 $$\n\n**Case 1: Unbinned Acquisition**\nIn this mode, each of the $4$ pixels in the $2 \\times 2$ block is read out individually. The total signal, $S_{\\text{unbinned}}$, is then calculated in software by summing the values of the four pixels.\nThe mean total signal is the sum of the mean signals from each pixel:\n$$ \\langle S_{\\text{unbinned}} \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^4 S_p = 4 S_p = S = 10{,}000 $$\nThe total noise variance, $\\sigma_{\\text{unbinned}}^2$, is the sum of the total noise variances from each of the $4$ independent pixel readouts. Since the noise in each pixel is independent, their variances add:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{unbinned}}^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^4 \\sigma_p^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^4 (S_p + r^2) = 4(S_p + r^2) = 4S_p + 4r^2 $$\nSubstituting $S = 4S_p$, we get:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{unbinned}}^2 = S + 4r^2 $$\nThe standard deviation of the total noise is the square root of this variance:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{unbinned}} = \\sqrt{S + 4r^2} $$\nNow, we can compute the SNR for the unbinned mode:\n$$ \\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{unbinned}} = \\frac{\\langle S_{\\text{unbinned}} \\rangle}{\\sigma_{\\text{unbinned}}} = \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{S + 4r^2}} $$\nSubstituting the given values $S = 10{,}000$ and $r=1$:\n$$ \\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{unbinned}} = \\frac{10{,}000}{\\sqrt{10{,}000 + 4(1)^2}} = \\frac{10{,}000}{\\sqrt{10{,}004}} \\approx 99.980001999... $$\nRounding to five significant figures, $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{unbinned}} = 99.980$.\n\n**Case 2: Binned Acquisition**\nIn this mode, the charge from the $4$ physical pixels in the $2 \\times 2$ block is physically combined on the CCD chip into a single \"superpixel\" *before* the readout process. This entire charge packet is then read out only once.\nThe total signal in the superpixel, $S_{\\text{binned}}$, is the sum of the charge from the individual pixels:\n$$ \\langle S_{\\text{binned}} \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^4 S_p = S = 10{,}000 $$\nThe total noise variance, $\\sigma_{\\text{binned}}^2$, is again the sum of the total shot noise variance and the total read noise variance.\n- The total number of photoelectrons collected in the superpixel is $S$. The shot noise associated with this total signal follows Poisson statistics, so the shot noise variance is $\\sigma_{\\text{shot, binned}}^2 = S$.\n- Since the entire superpixel is read out in a single operation, there is only one read noise event. The associated variance is $\\sigma_{r, \\text{binned}}^2 = r^2$.\nThe total noise variance for the binned measurement is therefore:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{binned}}^2 = \\sigma_{\\text{shot, binned}}^2 + \\sigma_{r, \\text{binned}}^2 = S + r^2 $$\nThe standard deviation of the total noise is the square root of this variance:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{binned}} = \\sqrt{S + r^2} $$\nThe SNR for the binned mode is:\n$$ \\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{binned}} = \\frac{\\langle S_{\\text{binned}} \\rangle}{\\sigma_{\\text{binned}}} = \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{S + r^2}} $$\nSubstituting the given values $S = 10{,}000$ and $r=1$:\n$$ \\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{binned}} = \\frac{10{,}000}{\\sqrt{10{,}000 + (1)^2}} = \\frac{10{,}000}{\\sqrt{10{,}001}} \\approx 99.995000124... $$\nRounding to five significant figures, $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{binned}} = 99.995$.\nThe result correctly shows that binning improves SNR in read-noise-limited regimes by reducing the total contribution of read noise.\n\n**Effective Linear Pixel Size under Binning**\nLet the original linear size (edge length) of a single square pixel be $L$. The area of this pixel is $A = L^2$.\nHardware binning of a $2 \\times 2$ block of pixels combines them into a single superpixel. The area of this new superpixel, $A_{\\text{binned}}$, is the sum of the areas of the four original pixels:\n$$ A_{\\text{binned}} = 4 \\times A = 4L^2 $$\nLet the effective linear size of this new square superpixel be $L_{\\text{binned}}$. Its area is $A_{\\text{binned}} = (L_{\\text{binned}})^2$.\nEquating the two expressions for the binned area:\n$$ (L_{\\text{binned}})^2 = 4L^2 $$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n$$ L_{\\text{binned}} = 2L $$\nThe effective linear pixel size is multiplied by a factor of $2$. This is the requested size multiplier.\n\n**Final Answer Compilation**\nThe required components for the final answer are:\n- Size multiplier: $2$\n- $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{unbinned}}$: $99.980$\n- $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{binned}}$: $99.995$\n\nThese are arranged in a row vector as specified.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 99.980 & 99.995\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2716065"}, {"introduction": "Ultimately, microscopy aims to answer biological questions by turning images into quantitative data.
