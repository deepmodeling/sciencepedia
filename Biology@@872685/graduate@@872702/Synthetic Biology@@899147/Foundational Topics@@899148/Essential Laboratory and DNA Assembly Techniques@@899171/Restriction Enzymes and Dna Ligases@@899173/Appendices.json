A single digest with EcoRI gives two fragments of $7.0$ kb and $3.0$ kb, so there are two EcoRI sites partitioning the circle into arcs of lengths $7.0$ and $3.0$. A single digest with BamHI gives two fragments of $6.5$ kb and $3.5$ kb, so there are two BamHI sites partitioning the circle into arcs of lengths $6.5$ and $3.5$. A double digest with EcoRI and BamHI yields four fragments of lengths $4.0$ kb, $3.0$ kb, $2.5$ kb, and $0.5$ kb; these are the consecutive segment lengths between adjacent restriction sites around the circle.\n\nDenote the four double-digest segment lengths as the multiset $\\{0.5,2.5,3.0,4.0\\}$, arranged in some cyclic order $(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4})$ around the plasmid. Each single-digest fragment length must equal the sum of two consecutive double-digest segments, because the single-enzyme cut removes the intervening cuts of the other enzyme and merges adjacent segments.\n\nFor EcoRI, the two single-digest arcs are $7.0$ and $3.0$. Among the given segment lengths, the only way to obtain $3.0$ as a sum of consecutive segments is $0.5+2.5=3.0$. Therefore $0.5$ and $2.5$ must be adjacent and constitute one EcoRI arc, and the remaining two segments $4.0$ and $3.0$ must be adjacent and constitute the other EcoRI arc $4.0+3.0=7.0$.\n\nFor BamHI, the two single-digest arcs are $6.5$ and $3.5$. The only way to obtain $3.5$ as a sum of consecutive segments is $3.0+0.5=3.5$. Therefore $3.0$ and $0.5$ must be adjacent and constitute one BamHI arc, and the remaining two segments $2.5$ and $4.0$ must be adjacent and constitute the other BamHI arc $2.5+4.0=6.5$.\n\nCombining these adjacency constraints, a cyclic order that satisfies both is $0.5-2.5-4.0-3.0$ (unique up to rotation and reversal). In this arrangement, the BamHI sites lie at the boundaries between the BamHI arcs, i.e., between $0.5$ and $2.5$ and between $4.0$ and $3.0$. The two arcs between the BamHI sites then have lengths $2.5+4.0=6.5$ and $3.0+0.5=3.5$. The shortest distance along the plasmid backbone between the two BamHI sites is therefore $3.5$ kb.

After assembling a new plasmid, a critical step is verifying that the components were ligated correctly. This final practice problem places you in the role of a molecular engineer, challenging you to design a diagnostic digest to confirm the orientation of a cloned insert—a common point of failure in ligation. This task requires integrating knowledge of restriction sites and fragment analysis to create a robust verification strategy, a skill central to the synthetic biology design-build-test-learn cycle [@problem_id:2769730].", "problem": "A synthetic biology team assembles a modular expression plasmid by ligating a coding sequence insert into a circular vector using two restriction enzymes that produce compatible cohesive ends. The vector has been linearized by digestion at two unique cloning sites that generate compatible overhangs (e.g., *SpeI*/*XbaI*), so that the insert can ligate in either the intended orientation or the inverted orientation. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ligase seals the backbone after ligation. You are given the following map-level facts and are asked to design a diagnostic restriction digest that uniquely distinguishes the intended construct from a common misligation (insert inversion), and then to calculate the expected fragment sizes for both cases.\n\nFoundational facts to use:\n- A restriction enzyme (RE) that cuts a circular DNA molecule at exactly two unique positions generates exactly two linear fragments whose lengths sum to the total plasmid length.\n- When two cuts occur at positions on two distinct modules (vector backbone and insert), the fragment sizes are the arc lengths between the cut sites along the circle, respecting the specified distances along backbone and insert segments.\n\nConstruction details:\n- Final circular plasmid total length is $L_{\\mathrm{tot}} = L_{\\mathrm{b}} + L_{\\mathrm{i}}$, where the backbone segment length between the two ligation junctions is $L_{\\mathrm{b}} = 3680$ base pairs (bp), and the insert length is $L_{\\mathrm{i}} = 1320$ bp, so that $L_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 5000$ bp.\n- Define the two backbone–insert junctions as $J_{1}$ and $J_{2}$. Along the backbone arc from $J_{1}$ to $J_{2}$, there is a unique *HindIII* site $H$ located at a distance $a = 430$ bp from $J_{1}$ in the $J_{1} \\rightarrow J_{2}$ direction (hence the remaining backbone distance from $H$ to $J_{2}$ along the same direction is $L_{\\mathrm{b}} - a = 3250$ bp).\n- The insert carries a unique *PstI* site $P$ located at an internal distance $p = 290$ bp from the insert end that is at $J_{1}$ in the intended orientation. Consequently, its distance from the insert end at $J_{2}$ is $L_{\\mathrm{i}} - p = 1030$ bp.\n\nTask:\n- Select a two-enzyme diagnostic digest using only the provided unique sites $H$ (*HindIII*, backbone-only) and $P$ (*PstI*, insert-only) that will uniquely resolve the intended orientation versus the inverted orientation. Justify briefly why this digest is diagnostic under the stated map constraints.\n- Calculate the two expected fragment sizes for the intended orientation under this digest.\n- Calculate the two expected fragment sizes for the inverted-orientation misligation under the same digest.\n- Finally, report a single number: the absolute difference, in base pairs, between the smaller fragments produced by the intended orientation versus the inverted orientation. Express your final answer in base pairs (bp). No rounding is required. All intermediate quantities should be treated exactly.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is found to be self-contained, scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular biology, and mathematically well-posed. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to design a diagnostic restriction digest to distinguish between two possible orientations of a DNA insert within a plasmid vector and to calculate the resulting fragment sizes. The plasmid is circular.\n\nFirst, we must select an appropriate enzyme or combination of enzymes for the digest. The problem provides two unique restriction sites: a *HindIII* site, denoted $H$, located on the vector backbone, and a *PstI* site, denoted $P$, located on the insert. A single-enzyme digest with only *HindIII* would cut the circular plasmid once, linearizing it to a length of $L_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 5000$ bp, regardless of the insert's orientation. Similarly, a single-enzyme digest with only *PstI* would also produce a single $5000$ bp linear fragment in both cases. Neither single digest is diagnostic. Therefore, the only logical choice for a diagnostic digest is a double digest using both *HindIII* and *PstI*. This digest will cleave the circular plasmid at two distinct locations, $H$ and $P$, generating two linear fragments. The sizes of these fragments depend on the arc length between $H$ and $P$, which in turn depends on the orientation of the insert. This dependence on orientation is what makes the double digest diagnostic.\n\nLet us model the circular plasmid. The total length is $L_{\\mathrm{tot}} = L_{\\mathrm{b}} + L_{\\mathrm{i}}$, where $L_{\\mathrm{b}} = 3680$ bp is the length of the backbone segment and $L_{\\mathrm{i}} = 1320$ bp is the length of the insert. The junctions between the backbone and the insert are denoted $J_{1}$ and $J_{2}$. The two cleavage sites, $H$ and $P$, divide the circle into two arcs. The lengths of the resulting fragments will be the lengths of these two arcs.\n\nLet us calculate the fragment sizes for the **intended orientation**.\nThe site $H$ is on the backbone at a distance $a = 430$ bp from junction $J_{1}$. The remaining distance on the backbone from $H$ to $J_{2}$ is $L_{\\mathrm{b}} - a = 3680 - 430 = 3250$ bp.\nIn the intended orientation, the site $P$ is on the insert at a distance $p = 290$ bp from the end of the insert that ligates at $J_{1}$. The distance from $P$ to the other end of the insert (at $J_{2}$) is $L_{\\mathrm{i}} - p = 1320 - 290 = 1030$ bp.\n\nThe two fragments produced by the *HindIII*/*PstI* double digest correspond to the two paths along the circle between sites $H$ and $P$.\nPath 1 traverses from $H$ to $J_{1}$ along the backbone and then from $J_{1}$ to $P$ along the insert. The length of this fragment, $F_{\\mathrm{int},1}$, is the sum of these segment lengths:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{int},1} = a + p = 430 + 290 = 720 \\text{ bp}$$\nPath 2 traverses from $H$ to $J_{2}$ along the backbone and then from $J_{2}$ to $P$ along the insert. The length of this fragment, $F_{\\mathrm{int},2}$, is the sum of these segment lengths:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{int},2} = (L_{\\mathrm{b}} - a) + (L_{\\mathrm{i}} - p) = (3680 - 430) + (1320 - 290) = 3250 + 1030 = 4280 \\text{ bp}$$\nAs a check, the sum of the fragment lengths must equal the total plasmid length: $F_{\\mathrm{int},1} + F_{\\mathrm{int},2} = 720 + 4280 = 5000$ bp, which matches $L_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. The two expected fragment sizes for the intended orientation are $720$ bp and $4280$ bp.\n\nNext, we calculate the fragment sizes for the **inverted orientation**.\nIn this case, the insert is flipped. The insert end that was at $J_{1}$ is now at $J_{2}$, and vice-versa. The location of site $H$ on the backbone remains unchanged. However, the position of site $P$ relative to the junctions is now different. The distance from the junction $J_{1}$ to $P$ along the insert is now $L_{\\mathrm{i}} - p$, and the distance from junction $J_{2}$ to $P$ along the insert is now $p$.\n\nWe recalculate the fragment lengths for the inverted case.\nPath 1 traverses from $H$ to $J_{1}$ along the backbone and then from $J_{1}$ to $P$ along the inverted insert. The length of this fragment, $F_{\\mathrm{inv},1}$, is:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{inv},1} = a + (L_{\\mathrm{i}} - p) = 430 + (1320 - 290) = 430 + 1030 = 1460 \\text{ bp}$$\nPath 2 traverses from $H$ to $J_{2}$ along the backbone and then from $J_{2}$ to $P$ along the inverted insert. The length of this fragment, $F_{\\mathrm{inv},2}$, is:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{inv},2} = (L_{\\mathrm{b}} - a) + p = (3680 - 430) + 290 = 3250 + 290 = 3540 \\text{ bp}$$\nAs a check, the sum is $F_{\\mathrm{inv},1} + F_{\\mathrm{inv},2} = 1460 + 3540 = 5000$ bp, which correctly equals $L_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. The two expected fragment sizes for the inverted orientation are $1460$ bp and $3540$ bp.\n\nThe digest is diagnostic because the set of fragment sizes for the intended orientation $\\{720, 4280\\}$ is distinct from the set for the inverted orientation $\\{1460, 3540\\}$.\n\nFinally, the problem requires the absolute difference between the smaller fragments produced in each case.\nThe smaller fragment in the intended orientation is $F_{\\mathrm{int,smaller}} = \\min(F_{\\mathrm{int},1}, F_{\\mathrm{int},2}) = \\min(720, 4280) = 720$ bp.\nThe smaller fragment in the inverted orientation is $F_{\\mathrm{inv,smaller}} = \\min(F_{\\mathrm{inv},1}, F_{\\mathrm{inv},2}) = \\min(1460, 3540) = 1460$ bp.\n\nThe absolute difference, $\\Delta$, between these two smaller fragments is:\n$$\\Delta = |F_{\\mathrm{inv,smaller}} - F_{\\mathrm{int,smaller}}| = |1460 - 720| = 740 \\text{ bp}$$\nThis difference, $740$ bp, is large enough to be easily resolved by standard agarose gel electrophoresis, confirming the diagnostic utility of the *HindIII*/*PstI* double digest.
