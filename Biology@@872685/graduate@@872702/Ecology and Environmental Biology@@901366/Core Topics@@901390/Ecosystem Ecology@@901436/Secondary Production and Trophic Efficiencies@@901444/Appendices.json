By definition (i), this is the fraction of net primary production that is ingested by the herbivores.\n$$E_{c} = \\frac{I}{N}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$E_{c} = \\frac{400~\\mathrm{g~C~m^{-2}~yr^{-1}}}{1000~\\mathrm{g~C~m^{-2}~yr^{-1}}} = 0.40$$\n\nSecond, we determine the assimilation efficiency, $E_{a}$. By definition (ii), this is the fraction of ingested material that is assimilated. The problem states this fraction is $a = 0.50$.\n$$E_{a} = a = 0.50$$\nThe total assimilated carbon is $A = E_{a} \\times I = 0.50 \\times 400~\\mathrm{g~C~m^{-2}~yr^{-1}} = 200~\\mathrm{g~C~m^{-2}~yr^{-1}}$.\n\nThird, we determine the production efficiency, $E_{p}$.

The definitions are clear, self-contained, and consistent. The provided numerical values are plausible. The problem is well-posed, objective, and requires logical deduction based on the provided model. It is not trivial or based on any fallacies. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe objective is to compute the production efficiency, $\\mathrm{PE} = P/I_{C}$. The quantity $P$ represents the carbon incorporated into new biomass. This process is constrained by the availability of assimilated nutrients and the strict stoichiometric requirement of the consumer's biomass, which is a molar C:N ratio of $r_{c} = 6$.\n\nFirst, we determine the amounts of assimilated carbon ($A_{C}$) and nitrogen ($A_{N}$) relative to the ingested carbon, $I_{C}$.\nThe amount of assimilated carbon is given by:\n$$A_{C} = AE_{C} \\cdot I_{C} = 0.7 \\cdot I_{C}$$\nThe amount of ingested nitrogen, $I_{N}$, is related to ingested carbon, $I_{C}$, by the diet's C:N ratio, $r_{d}$:\n$$I_{N} = \\frac{I_{C}}{r_{d}} = \\frac{I_{C}}{20}$$\nThe amount of assimilated nitrogen, $A_{N}$, is then:\n$$A_{N} = AE_{N} \\cdot I_{N} = AE_{N} \\cdot \\frac{I_{C}}{r_{d}} = 0.7 \\cdot \\frac{I_{C}}{20}$$\n\nNext, we must identify the limiting nutrient for growth. This is determined by comparing the ratio of available assimilated nutrients to the ratio required for new biomass. The ratio of assimilated carbon to assimilated nitrogen is:\n$$\\frac{A_{C}}{A_{N}} = \\frac{AE_{C} \\cdot I_{C}}{AE_{N} \\cdot (I_{C}/r_{d})}$$\nGiven that $AE_{C} = AE_{N} = 0.7$, these terms cancel:\n$$\\frac{A_{C}}{A_{N}} = \\frac{I_{C}}{I_{C}/r_{d}} = r_{d} = 20$$\nThe consumer's biomass requires a C:N ratio of $r_{c} = 6$. We compare the ratio of available assimilated nutrients ($A_{C}/A_{N} = 20$) with the ratio required for biomass ($r_{c} = 6$).\nSince $A_{C}/A_{N} > r_{c}$ (that is, $20 > 6$), carbon is available in stoichiometric excess relative to nitrogen. Thus, nitrogen is the limiting nutrient for growth.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, growth proceeds by utilizing the entirety of the limiting nutrient. Therefore, all assimilated nitrogen, $A_{N}$, will be incorporated into new biomass. Let $P_{N}$ be the nitrogen incorporated into production.\n$$P_{N} = A_{N} = 0.7 \\cdot \\frac{I_{C}}{20}$$\nThe amount of carbon incorporated into new biomass, defined as production $P$, must satisfy the consumer's stoichiometric ratio $r_{c}$ with respect to the incorporated nitrogen $P_{N}$.\n$$\\frac{P}{P_{N}} = r_{c}$$\n$$P = r_{c} \\cdot P_{N}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_{N}$:\n$$P = r_{c} \\cdot \\left( 0.7 \\cdot \\frac{I_{C}}{20} \\right)$$\nThe problem asks for the production efficiency, $\\mathrm{PE}$, defined as $P/I_{C}$.\n$$\\mathrm{PE} = \\frac{P}{I_{C}} = \\frac{r_{c} \\cdot \\left( 0.7 \\cdot \\frac{I_{C}}{20} \\right)}{I_{C}}$$\nThe term $I_{C}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding the expression for $\\mathrm{PE}$:\n$$\\mathrm{PE} = \\frac{r_{c} \\cdot 0.7}{r_{d}}$$\nIn a more general form, for nitrogen limitation ($r_{d} > r_{c}$), given $AE_C = AE_N$:\n$$\\mathrm{PE} = \\frac{r_{c} \\cdot AE_{N}}{r_{d}}$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values: $r_{c}=6$, $r_{d}=20$, and $AE_{N}=0.7$.\n$$\\mathrm{PE} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 0.7}{20} = \\frac{4.2}{20}$$\n$$\\mathrm{PE} = 0.21$$\nThe excess assimilated carbon, $A_C^{excess}$, is respired. This is calculated as the total assimilated carbon minus the carbon used for production:\n$A_C^{excess} = A_C - P = (0.7 \\cdot I_C) - (0.21 \\cdot I_C) = 0.49 \\cdot I_C$. This confirms that a substantial portion of assimilated carbon is not used for growth due to stoichiometric imbalance.

You are tasked with calibrating a temperature-dependent bioenergetics model of ingestion and respiration from laboratory measurements and then using the calibrated model to compute predicted gross growth efficiency across specified temperature gradients. Your derivation and implementation must begin only from core definitions and widely accepted empirical temperature-scaling relations and must not assume any target efficiencies a priori.\n\nStart from the following foundational definitions and facts.\n\n1. Organismal energy-budget identity (per individual, per unit time): the ingested energy $I(T)$ is partitioned into growth $G(T)$, respiration $R(T)$, excretion $U(T)$, specific dynamic action $S(T)$ (post-absorptive processing cost), and egestion $F(T)$ (unassimilated feces), so $I(T) = G(T) + R(T) + U(T) + S(T) + F(T)$.\n2. Assimilation efficiency $AE$ is the fraction of ingested energy that is assimilated, so $A(T) = AE \\cdot I(T)$ and $F(T) = (1 - AE) \\cdot I(T)$.\n3. A commonly used representation of post-absorptive costs models $U(T)$ and $S(T)$ as fixed fractions of assimilated energy: $U(T) = e \\cdot A(T)$ and $S(T) = s \\cdot A(T)$, with constants $e$ and $s$ that are independent of $T$ over the studied range.\n4. The gross growth efficiency (GGE) is defined as the fraction of ingestion that becomes growth: $\\mathrm{GGE}(T) = \\dfrac{G(T)}{I(T)}$, expressed as a decimal fraction (unitless).\n5. Over a moderate, sublethal temperature range, many physiological rates are well described by a $Q_{10}$ model: for any rate $X(T)$, $X(T) = X_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\cdot q^{(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}})/10}$, where $X_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is the rate at reference temperature $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, and $q$ is the $Q_{10}$ parameter. Taking natural logarithms yields $\\ln X(T) = \\ln X_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\left(\\dfrac{\\ln q}{10}\\right) (T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}})$, which enables linear least-squares calibration.\n\nCalibration objective: Calibrate two separate $Q_{10}$ models, one for ingestion $I(T)$ and one for respiration $R(T)$, by minimizing the sum of squared residuals in natural-log space between the observed and modeled rates. That is, for each process $X \\in \\{I, R\\}$, estimate $X_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ and $q_X$ by ordinary least squares on the linearized form $\\ln X(T) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}})$, with $\\beta_0 = \\ln X_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ and $\\beta_1 = \\dfrac{\\ln q_X}{10}$.\n\nOnce calibrated, compute predicted $\\mathrm{GGE}(T)$ along specified temperature gradients using only the energy-budget identities and the calibrated $I(T)$ and $R(T)$.
