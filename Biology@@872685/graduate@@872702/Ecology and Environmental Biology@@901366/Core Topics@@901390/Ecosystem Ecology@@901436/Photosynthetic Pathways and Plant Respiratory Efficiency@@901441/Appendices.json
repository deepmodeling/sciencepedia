Assume metabolic steady state: there is no net accumulation of intermediates, and any net export of triose phosphate is balanced by inorganic phosphate return so that total phosphate in the chloroplast remains constant.\n\nUse only the following well-tested biochemical steps and universal conservation constraints to derive the energetic cost per mole of $\\text{CO}_2$ assimilated:\n\n- RuBisCO carboxylation chemistry: one molecule of ribulose-$1,5$-bisphosphate (RuBP; $5$ carbon, $2$ phosphate) reacts with one molecule of $\\text{CO}_2$ and water to yield $2$ molecules of $3$-phosphoglycerate ($3$-PGA; each $3$ carbon, $1$ phosphate). Carbon and phosphate are conserved in this step.\n\n- Phosphoglycerate kinase reaction class: each molecule of $3$-PGA is phosphorylated by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to $1,3$-bisphosphoglycerate ($1,3$-BPG), producing adenosine diphosphate (ADP).\n\n- Glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction class: each molecule of $1,3$-BPG is reduced by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced) (NADPH) to glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate (GAP), releasing inorganic phosphate and producing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (oxidized) (NADP$^{+}$).\n\n- Regeneration of RuBP from triose phosphates proceeds via carbon-skeleton rearrangements without redox chemistry, followed by the phosphoribulokinase reaction: ribulose-$5$-phosphate (Ru$5$P) is phosphorylated by ATP to RuBP.\n\nStarting from these steps and the principles of conservation of carbon and phosphate, determine the minimal closed-cycle stoichiometry that yields a nonzero net export of GAP and compute the total ATP and NADPH consumed per mole of $\\text{CO}_2$ assimilated under these conditions. Do not assume any pre-memorized overall formulas; instead, derive the counts from first principles and integer constraints that arise from carbon conservation in the regeneration network.\n\nReport your final answer as a row matrix $\\left(\\text{ATP per } \\text{CO}_2,\\ \\text{NADPH per } \\text{CO}_2\\right)$ with exact integers.

The quantities are dimensionless molar ratios.", "solution": "We proceed from conservation of carbon and phosphate, using the specified enzymatic steps as the only energetic transactions.\n\nDefine the variables and constraints:\n\n- Let $n$ be the number of RuBisCO carboxylation events operating in one minimal closed turnover that yields a nonzero net export of glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate (GAP). Each carboxylation consumes $1$ RuBP and $1$ $\\text{CO}_2$ and produces $2$ molecules of $3$-phosphoglycerate ($3$-PGA).\n\n- Each molecule of $3$-PGA is converted to $1,3$-bisphosphoglycerate ($1,3$-BPG) by consuming $1$ ATP, and each $1,3$-BPG is reduced to GAP by consuming $1$ NADPH and releasing $1$ inorganic phosphate.\n\n- Regeneration of RuBP from triose phosphate is carbon conserving and redox neutral; the only energetic investment in regeneration is the phosphorylation of ribulose-$5$-phosphate (Ru$5$P) to RuBP by phosphoribulokinase, which consumes $1$ ATP per RuBP regenerated.\n\nStep $1$: Determine the minimal integer $n$ that allows a closed cycle with net export of GAP.\n\n- After $n$ carboxylation events, the amount of triose phosphate produced (before any export or regeneration) is $2n$ GAP equivalents, because each RuBisCO event yields $2$ molecules of $3$-PGA, each of which is reduced to $1$ GAP.\n\n- Regeneration stoichiometry from well-established Calvin–Benson–Bassham network accounting requires $5$ triose-phosphate molecules to regenerate $3$ RuBP molecules, conserving carbon: $5 \\times 3 = 15$ carbon in, $3 \\times 5 = 15$ carbon out. Equivalently, to regenerate $n$ RuBP molecules, the required number of triose-phosphate molecules is $\\frac{5}{3}n$. This implies $n$ must be a multiple of $3$ to keep all molecule counts integral.\n\n- Write $n = 3k$ with integer $k \\geq 1$. Then the total triose phosphate produced is $2n = 6k$, the triose phosphate consumed in regeneration is $\\frac{5}{3}n = 5k$, and the net export of GAP is $6k - 5k = k$ molecules.\n\n- The minimal nonzero net export occurs for $k = 1$, giving $n = 3$ carboxylations, $6$ GAP produced, $5$ GAP used to regenerate $3$ RuBP, and $1$ GAP exported. This is the smallest closed-cycle turnover with a nonzero net product.\n\nThus, the minimal closed cycle that yields net product uses $n = 3$ carboxylations and exports $1$ GAP molecule containing $3$ carbon atoms, corresponding to assimilation of $3$ molecules of $\\text{CO}_2$.\n\nStep $2$: Count ATP and NADPH consumed for $n = 3$.\n\n- Reduction phase (from $3$-PGA to GAP): For each carboxylation event, there are $2$ molecules of $3$-PGA formed. Each $3$-PGA requires $1$ ATP to become $1,3$-BPG and $1$ NADPH to become GAP. Therefore, for $n = 3$, there are $2n = 6$ molecules of $3$-PGA, which consume:\n  - ATP for phosphorylation: $6$ ATP.\n  - NADPH for reduction: $6$ NADPH.\n\n- Regeneration phase (from triose phosphate to RuBP): To close the cycle for $n = 3$, we must regenerate $3$ RuBP molecules from $5$ GAP molecules. The only energetic step specified is phosphoribulokinase, which phosphorylates Ru$5$P to RuBP at a cost of $1$ ATP per RuBP. Therefore, regeneration consumes:\n  - ATP for Ru$5$P phosphorylation: $3$ ATP.\n  - NADPH: $0$ NADPH, because regeneration is redox neutral.\n\n- Total cofactors consumed for $n = 3$:\n  - ATP: $6 + 3 = 9$ ATP.\n  - NADPH: $6$ NADPH.\n\nStep $3$: Normalize per mole of $\\text{CO}_2$ assimilated.\n\n- For $n = 3$, the cycle assimilates $3$ molecules of $\\text{CO}_2$. Therefore, per mole of $\\text{CO}_2$:\n  - ATP per $\\text{CO}_2$: $\\frac{9}{3} = 3$.\n  - NADPH per $\\text{CO}_2$: $\\frac{6}{3} = 2$.\n\nStep $4$: Phosphate conservation consistency check.\n\n- The $6$ phosphorylations of $3$-PGA to $1,3$-BPG consume $6$ ATP (transferring $6$ phosphate groups from ATP to $3$-PGA), and the $6$ reductions of $1,3$-BPG to GAP release $6$ inorganic phosphate, returning those $6$ phosphate groups to the free phosphate pool. The $3$ phosphoribulokinase reactions consume $3$ ATP to add $3$ phosphate groups back to Ru$5$P, regenerating the $3$ RuBP molecules. With net export of $1$ GAP balanced by import of $1$ inorganic phosphate via the triose phosphate/phosphate translocator, the total phosphate content of the chloroplast remains constant. Thus, the ATP and NADPH counts above are consistent with phosphate conservation.\n\nTherefore, under the stated assumptions (no photorespiration; steady state; phosphate conserved), the energetic cost per mole of $\\text{CO}_2$ assimilated in $\\mathrm{C3}$ photosynthesis is $3$ ATP and $2$ NADPH.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}3 & 2\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2520459"}, {"introduction": "While the Calvin-Benson cycle is central to photosynthesis, the dual carboxylase/oxygenase function of RuBisCO introduces a major inefficiency in C3 plants known as photorespiration.
