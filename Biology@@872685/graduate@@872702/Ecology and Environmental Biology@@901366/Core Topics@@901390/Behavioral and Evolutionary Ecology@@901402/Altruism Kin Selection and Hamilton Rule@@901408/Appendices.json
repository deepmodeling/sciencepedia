The inclusive fitness effect, $\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{IF}}$, is the sum of the effects on the actor's own fitness and the effects on the fitness of its relatives, with the latter devalued by the coefficient of relatedness.\n\nThe strategy is to help if and only if a partner is perceived as kin. We must calculate the expected inclusive fitness change per social opportunity, which we denote as $\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{opp}}$. An opportunity is a single encounter with a social partner. The partner is a true kin with probability $p$ and a non-kin with probability $1-p$.\n\nWe sum the inclusive fitness effects over all possible outcomes of an encounter:\n1.  The partner is kin (probability $p$) and is correctly perceived as kin (probability $1-\\beta$). The actor helps. The inclusive fitness effect is the cost to self, $-c$, plus the benefit to the kin recipient weighted by relatedness, $r_k b$. The net effect for this event is $-c + r_k b$.\n2.  The partner is kin (probability $p$) and is incorrectly perceived as non-kin (probability $\\beta$). The actor does not help. The inclusive fitness effect is $0$.\n3.  The partner is non-kin (probability $1-p$) and is incorrectly perceived as kin (probability $\\alpha$). The actor helps. The inclusive fitness effect is $-c + r_0 b$.\n4.  The partner is non-kin (probability $1-p$) and is correctly perceived as non-kin (probability $1-\\alpha$). The actor does not help. The inclusive fitness effect is $0$.\n\nThe expected inclusive fitness change per social opportunity is the probability-weighted sum of these outcomes:\n$$\n\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{opp}} = p(1-\\beta)(-c + r_k b) + p\\beta(0) + (1-p)\\alpha(-c + r_0 b) + (1-p)(1-\\alpha)(0)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{opp}} = p(1-\\beta)r_k b - p(1-\\beta)c + (1-p)\\alpha r_0 b - (1-p)\\alpha c\n$$\nGrouping the benefit and cost terms separately gives:\n$$\n\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{opp}} = \\big[ p(1-\\beta)r_k + (1-p)\\alpha r_0 \\big]b - \\big[ p(1-\\beta) + (1-p)\\alpha \\big]c\n$$\nThe behavioral strategy is favored by natural selection if and only if $\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{opp}}  0$.

We divide by the total probability of giving help, which is $P(\\text{help}) = p(1-\\beta) + (1-p)\\alpha$. Assuming this probability is greater than zero (i.e., help is sometimes given), the condition becomes:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{p(1-\\beta)r_k + (1-p)\\alpha r_0}{p(1-\\beta) + (1-p)\\alpha} \\right) b  c\n$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is the average relatedness of the actor to recipients, conditional on help being performed. We define this as the effective relatedness, $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{eff}} = E[r | \\text{help is given}] = \\frac{p(1-\\beta)r_k + (1-p)\\alpha r_0}{p(1-\\beta) + (1-p)\\alpha}\n$$\nThe condition for the helping strategy to be favored thus simplifies to the per-act Hamilton's rule: $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}b  c$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Conditional on help being given, the parameters $b$ and $c$ per act are unchanged by recognition error. The only modification to the per-act Hamilton’s rule criterion is via the effective relatedness among actual recipients of help,\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\;=\\; \\frac{p(1-\\beta)\\, r_k \\;+\\; (1-p)\\alpha\\, r_0}{p(1-\\beta) \\;+\\; (1-p)\\alpha},\n$$\nso that helping is favored for an act if and only if $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\, b \\;\\; c$.**\n\nThis statement is entirely consistent with our derivation. The problem states that $b$ and $c$ are constant per act. Our derivation shows that the overall condition for the strategy's success can be expressed as a per-act rule where the cost $c$ is compared against the benefit $b$ weighted by an effective relatedness $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The formula provided for $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is identical to the one we derived. This represents the average relatedness to actual recipients, correctly accounting for both types of recognition errors.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. False positives inflate the realized cost per helping act to $c/(1-\\alpha)$ because some help goes to non-kin, but the realized $b$ and $r$ per act remain unchanged.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. First, the cost per helping act is given as $c$. The quantity $c/(1-\\alpha)$ has no theoretical justification and is dimensionally inconsistent if interpreted as a modified cost. The recognition errors affect the *frequency* and *targeting* of altruistic acts, not the intrinsic cost of a single act. Second, the assertion that the \"realized $r$ per act\" remains unchanged is false. As shown in the derivation of $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the average relatedness of a recipient is a function of both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. The entire point is that recognition errors modify the realized (i.e., average) relatedness of recipients.\n\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. The expected inclusive fitness effect per social opportunity equals\n$$\n\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{opp}} \\;=\\; \\big[p(1-\\beta)\\, r_k\\, b \\;+\\; (1-p)\\alpha\\, r_0\\, b\\big] \\;-\\; \\big[p(1-\\beta) \\;+\\; (1-p)\\alpha\\big]\\, c,\n$$\nso both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ reduce the realized benefit term and increase the realized cost term.**\n\nThe formula presented for $\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{opp}}$ is correct; it matches our derivation. However, the subsequent interpretation is flawed. Let's analyze the effect of increasing the error rates on the \"realized benefit term\" $B_{\\mathrm{term}} = [p(1-\\beta)r_k + (1-p)\\alpha r_0]b$ and the \"realized cost term\" $C_{\\mathrm{term}} = [p(1-\\beta) + (1-p)\\alpha]c$.\n-   An increase in the false positive rate $\\alpha$ *increases* $C_{\\mathrm{term}}$ because more help is given. It also *increases* $B_{\\mathrm{term}}$ (assuming typical case $r_0 \\ge 0$), as benefits are now also dispensed to non-kin. The statement claims it reduces the benefit term, which is incorrect.\n-   An increase in the false negative rate $\\beta$ *decreases* both $B_{\\mathrm{term}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{term}}$ because a higher $\\beta$ leads to fewer helping acts being directed toward kin, thus reducing the total benefits dispensed and total costs incurred per opportunity. The statement claims it increases the cost term, which is incorrect.\n\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. False negatives increase the realized per-act benefit $b$ experienced by kin who are helped by a factor $1/(1-\\beta)$ because kin-helping events become rarer and concentrate benefits.**\n\nThis is nonsensical. The problem explicitly premises that the benefit $b$ per act is a constant. The rate of false negatives, $\\beta$, influences the *probability* of a kin being helped, not the *magnitude* of the benefit if help is given. The \"concentration of benefits\" argument has no basis in the model's structure. Lowering the probability of an event does not increase the payoff of the event when it does occur.\n\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. In the special case $r_0 = 0$, reducing $\\alpha$ strictly increases $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and thus relaxes the relatedness threshold for helping, while increasing $\\beta$ reduces $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ but simultaneously lowers the expected cost per social opportunity by reducing the frequency of helping events.**\n\nLet's examine this in the special case $r_0=0$.\nThe effective relatedness becomes $r_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{p(1-\\beta)r_k}{p(1-\\beta) + (1-p)\\alpha}$.\n1.  **Effect of $\\alpha$**: The denominator increases with $\\alpha$ while the numerator is constant. Thus, increasing $\\alpha$ decreases $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. Consequently, reducing $\\alpha$ strictly increases $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. A higher $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ makes the condition $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}b  c$ easier to meet, which means the threshold for helping is relaxed. This part is correct.\n2.  **Effect of $\\beta$ on $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$**: We can write $r_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{r_k}{1 + \\frac{(1-p)\\alpha}{p(1-\\beta)}}$. As $\\beta$ increases, $1-\\beta$ decreases, the fraction in the denominator increases (for $\\alpha0$), and thus $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ decreases. This part is correct.\n3.  **Effect of $\\beta$ on expected cost**: The expected cost per social opportunity is $C_{\\mathrm{opp}} = [p(1-\\beta) + (1-p)\\alpha]c$. The derivative with respect to $\\beta$ is $\\frac{\\partial C_{\\mathrm{opp}}}{\\partial \\beta} = -pc$. Since $p0$ and $c0$, this derivative is negative. Therefore, increasing $\\beta$ lowers the expected cost per social opportunity. This is because fewer kin are helped, reducing the overall frequency of helping acts. This part is also correct.\n\nThe statement accurately describes the tradeoffs associated with recognition errors in this specific scenario.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2471192"}, {"introduction": "The evolution of cooperation is often complicated by non-additive fitness effects, where the benefit of an altruistic act depends on the behavior of others.

Under weak selection, this change $\\Delta \\bar{g}$ is proportional to the selection gradient $S$, which is defined as the covariance between an individual's absolute fitness, $w_i$, and its breeding value, $g_i$.

Let the variables for the Taylor expansion be $a_i$ and $\\bar{a}_{-i}$. The first-order expansion of $w_i(a_i, \\bar{a}_{-i})$ around the point $(0,0)$ is:\n$$w_i(a_i, \\bar{a}_{-i}) \\approx w_i(0,0) + a_i \\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial a_i}\\bigg|_{(0,0)} + \\bar{a}_{-i} \\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial \\bar{a}_{-i}}\\bigg|_{(0,0)}$$\nThe partial derivatives of the fitness function are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial a_i} = -c + s \\bar{a}_{-i}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial \\bar{a}_{-i}} = b + s a_i$$\nEvaluating these derivatives at the resident population state $(a_i, \\bar{a}_{-i})=(0,0)$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial a_i}\\bigg|_{(0,0)} = -c + s(0) = -c$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial \\bar{a}_{-i}}\\bigg|_{(0,0)} = b + s(0) = b$$\nThe fitness at the expansion point is $w_i(0,0) = w_0$. Substituting these into the Taylor expansion gives the linearized fitness function:\n$$w_i^{\\text{lin}} = w_0 - c a_i + b \\bar{a}_{-i}$$\nThe term $s a_i \\bar{a}_{-i}$ is a second-order term in the deviations $a_i$ and $\\bar{a}_{-i}$ and is thus excluded from the first-order approximation as per the instruction.\n\nNow, we compute the selection gradient $S$ using this linearized fitness:\n$$S = \\text{Cov}(w_i^{\\text{lin}}, g_i) = \\text{Cov}(w_0 - c a_i + b \\bar{a}_{-i}, g_i)$$\nUsing the property of covariance that $\\text{Cov}(X+Y, Z) = \\text{Cov}(X,Z) + \\text{Cov}(Y,Z)$ and $\\text{Cov}(kX, Y) = k\\text{Cov}(X,Y)$ for a constant $k$, we have:\n$$S = \\text{Cov}(w_0, g_i) - c\\text{Cov}(a_i, g_i) + b\\text{Cov}(\\bar{a}_{-i}, g_i)$$\nSince $w_0$ is a constant, $\\text{Cov}(w_0, g_i) = 0$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$S = -c\\text{Cov}(a_i, g_i) + b\\text{Cov}(\\bar{a}_{-i}, g_i)$$\nTo evaluate the remaining covariance terms, we use the information from the problem statement.\nFirst, we are given the genotype-phenotype map $\\mathbb{E}[a_i \\mid g_i] = g_i$.

The first term is zero as $g_i$ is constant when conditioned on $g_i$. So, $\\text{Cov}(a_i, g_i) = \\text{Cov}(g_i, g_i) = \\text{Var}(g_i)$.\n\nSecond, the coefficient of relatedness $r$ is defined as the regression of partners' mean phenotype on the focal's breeding value: $r \\equiv \\beta_{\\bar{a}_{-i}, g_i}$. By definition of a regression coefficient:\n$$r = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(\\bar{a}_{-i}, g_i)}{\\text{Var}(g_i)}$$\nRearranging this gives:\n$$\\text{Cov}(\\bar{a}_{-i}, g_i) = r \\cdot \\text{Var}(g_i)$$\nSubstituting these two results back into the expression for the selection gradient $S$:\n$$S = -c \\cdot \\text{Var}(g_i) + b \\cdot (r \\cdot \\text{Var}(g_i))$$\nWe can factor out the genetic variance $\\text{Var}(g_i)$:\n$$S = (-c + br) \\text{Var}(g_i)$$\nThis is the directional selection gradient on the altruistic breeding value. For selection to favor the spread of the altruistic allele, we need $S0$. Since $\\text{Var}(g_i)0$ (for a polymorphic population, which is required for selection to act), this is equivalent to the condition $-c+br0$.\n\nThe problem asks for the critical relatedness threshold $r^{\\dagger}$ at which the altruistic mutant is neutrally stable.
