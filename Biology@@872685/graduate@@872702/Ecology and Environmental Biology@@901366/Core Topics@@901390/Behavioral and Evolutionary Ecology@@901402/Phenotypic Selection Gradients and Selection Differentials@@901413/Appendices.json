The task is to compute the standardized selection differential, which is explicitly defined as the mean shift caused by selection expressed in units of the phenotypic standard deviation of $z$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically sound, as it is a direct application of fundamental principles of quantitative evolutionary genetics, specifically the framework for measuring natural selection. The concepts of phenotypic variance, selection differential, and selection intensity are central to this field. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and numerical values for a unique solution. The provided values are biologically plausible. Therefore, the problem is valid and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe standardized selection differential, or selection intensity $i$, is defined as the selection differential $S$ divided by the phenotypic standard deviation of the trait, $\\sigma_z$.

We are tasked to first derive the fundamental equation relating the selection differential vector $\\mathbf{S}$, the phenotypic variance-covariance matrix $\\mathbf{P}$, and the selection gradient vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, and then to compute $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ and interpret its components for a given system. The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, providing all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nWe begin with the derivation. The problem states that relative fitness $w$ can be approximated as a linear function of the mean-centered phenotype vector $\\mathbf{z}=(z_1, z_2)^{\\top}$. This relationship is expressed by the linear regression model:\n$$w = \\alpha + \\beta_1 z_1 + \\beta_2 z_2 + \\epsilon$$\nIn vector notation, this is $w = \\alpha + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{\\top}\\mathbf{z} + \\epsilon$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = (\\beta_1, \\beta_2)^{\\top}$ is the vector of directional selection gradients and $\\epsilon$ is the error term.\n\nWe take the expectation of both sides. Given that the traits are mean-centered, $E[\\mathbf{z}] = \\mathbf{0}$. The ordinary least squares (OLS) model assumes that the expected value of the error term is zero, $E[\\epsilon] = 0$. The mean relative fitness is given as $\\bar{w} = E[w] = 1$.\n$$E[w] = E[\\alpha + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{\\top}\\mathbf{z} + \\epsilon] = \\alpha + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{\\top}E[\\mathbf{z}] + E[\\epsilon]$$\n$$1 = \\alpha + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{\\top}\\mathbf{0} + 0 \\implies \\alpha = 1$$\nThe linear model for fitness is thus $w = 1 + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{\\top}\\mathbf{z} + \\epsilon$.\n\nThe problem states that the selection differential vector $\\mathbf{S}$ equals the covariance between the traits and relative fitness. By definition, the covariance between a vector of variables $\\mathbf{z}$ and a scalar variable $w$ is:\n$$\\mathbf{S} = \\text{cov}(\\mathbf{z}, w) = E[(\\mathbf{z} - E[\\mathbf{z}])(w - E[w])]$$\nSubstituting the known means, $E[\\mathbf{z}] = \\mathbf{0}$ and $E[w] = 1$, we have:\n$$\\mathbf{S} = E[\\mathbf{z}(w - 1)]$$\nNow, substitute the expression for $(w-1)$ from our linear fitness model, $w - 1 = \\mathbf{z}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\epsilon$.\n$$\\mathbf{S} = E[\\mathbf{z}(\\mathbf{z}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\epsilon)]$$\nUsing the linearity of the expectation operator:\n$$\\mathbf{S} = E[\\mathbf{z}\\mathbf{z}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}] + E[\\mathbf{z}\\epsilon]$$\nSince $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is a vector of constant coefficients, it can be factored out of the expectation:\n$$\\mathbf{S} = E[\\mathbf{z}\\mathbf{z}^{\\top}]\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + E[\\mathbf{z}\\epsilon]$$\nThe term $E[\\mathbf{z}\\mathbf{z}^{\\top}]$ is, by definition, the variance-covariance matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ of the mean-centered traits. The term $E[\\mathbf{z}\\epsilon]$ represents the covariance between the predictor variables and the error term. A fundamental assumption of OLS regression (the \"orthogonality condition\") is that this covariance is zero, i.e., $E[\\mathbf{z}\\epsilon] = \\mathbf{0}$.\nSubstituting these identities, we arrive at the required relationship:\n$$\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{P}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$$\nThis equation is a cornerstone of multivariate selection analysis. It demonstrates that the total selection on a set of traits ($\\mathbf{S}$) is a product of the direct selection pressures on those traits ($\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$) and the pattern of phenotypic variation and covariation among them ($\\mathbf{P}$).\n\nNext, we compute the selection gradient vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ for the given system. We rearrange the derived equation to solve for $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{S}$$\nThe provided matrices are:\n$$\\mathbf{P} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4  1 \\\\ 1  9 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{S} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.2 \\\\ -0.3 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nFirst, we compute the inverse of the phenotypic variance-covariance matrix, $\\mathbf{P}^{-1}$. For a general $2 \\times 2$ matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\\\ c  d \\end{pmatrix}$, the inverse is $\\frac{1}{ad-bc}\\begin{pmatrix} d  -b \\\\ -c  a \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe determinant of $\\mathbf{P}$ is $\\det(\\mathbf{P}) = (4)(9) - (1)(1) = 36 - 1 = 35$.\nThus, the inverse is:\n$$\\mathbf{P}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{35}\\begin{pmatrix} 9  -1 \\\\ -1  4 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nNow, we perform the matrix multiplication $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{S}$. To maintain exactness, we express the components of $\\mathbf{S}$ as fractions: $0.2 = \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5}$ and $-0.3 = -\\frac{3}{10}$.\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\frac{1}{35}\\begin{pmatrix} 9  -1 \\\\ -1  4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1/5 \\\\ -3/10 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\frac{1}{35}\\begin{pmatrix} (9)(\\frac{1}{5}) + (-1)(-\\frac{3}{10}) \\\\ (-1)(\\frac{1}{5}) + (4)(-\\frac{3}{10}) \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{35}\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{9}{5} + \\frac{3}{10} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{12}{10} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nTo combine the terms within the vector, we find a common denominator:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\frac{1}{35}\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{18}{10} + \\frac{3}{10} \\\\ -\\frac{2}{10} - \\frac{12}{10} \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{35}\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{21}{10} \\\\ -\\frac{14}{10} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nFinally, we multiply by the scalar $\\frac{1}{35}$:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{21}{350} \\\\ -\\frac{14}{350} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3 \\times 7}{50 \\times 7} \\\\ -\\frac{2 \\times 7}{50 \\times 7} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{50} \\\\ -\\frac{2}{50} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{50} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{25} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nSo, the components of the selection gradient vector are $\\beta_1 = \\frac{3}{50}$ and $\\beta_2 = -\\frac{1}{25}$.\n\nFinally, we interpret these components. The selection gradient $\\beta_i$ is the partial derivative of relative fitness with respect to trait $z_i$, $\\beta_i = \\partial w / \\partial z_i$. It quantifies the strength of *direct* selection on a trait, holding all other traits in the analysis constant.\nThe first component, $\\beta_1 = \\frac{3}{50} = 0.06$, is positive. This indicates that there is direct positive directional selection on trait $z_1$. An increase of one unit in trait $z_1$, while holding trait $z_2$ constant, corresponds to an increase of $0.06$ in an individual's expected relative fitness.\nThe second component, $\\beta_2 = -\\frac{1}{25} = -0.04$, is negative. This indicates that there is direct negative directional selection (i.e., selection for smaller trait values) on trait $z_2$. An increase of one unit in trait $z_2$, while holding trait $z_1$ constant, corresponds to a decrease of $0.04$ in expected relative fitness.\nIt is crucial to distinguish this from the selection differential $\\mathbf{S}$. The selection differential $S_i$ measures the total change in the mean of trait $i$ and is a function of both direct selection on trait $i$ and indirect selection that arises because trait $i$ is correlated with other traits under selection.
