It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to proceed with a solution. The problem describes a classical ecological field experiment and asks for the calculation and interpretation of an interaction strength, a fundamental concept in community ecology.\n\nThe primary task is to estimate the dynamic interaction strength between a predatory sea star (species $j$) and a consumer mussel (species $i$). This strength is defined as the per capita effect of the predator on the log-abundance of the prey, which is the derivative $\\frac{d(\\ln N_i)}{dN_j}$. The problem states that the relationship between the log-abundance of the mussel, $\\ln N_i$, and the density of the predator, $N_j$, is well-approximated by a linear function over the experimental range.\n\n1. Construction of the Estimator\n\nLet the linear relationship be modeled as:\n$$ \\ln N_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 N_j + \\epsilon $$\nHere, $N_i$ is the density of the mussel, $N_j$ is the density of the sea star, $\\beta_0$ is the intercept (representing the log-abundance of mussels in the absence of predators), $\\beta_1$ is the slope, and $\\epsilon$ is the residual error term, assumed to be additive and homoscedastic.\n\nThe dynamic interaction strength, being the derivative of $\\ln N_i$ with respect to $N_j$, corresponds directly to the slope parameter $\\beta_1$:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\ln N_i)}{dN_j} = \\beta_1 $$\nTo estimate this parameter from the experimental data, we construct an estimator for the slope of the best-fitting linear relationship. The standard method for this is Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), which minimizes the sum of the squared residuals.\n\nLet the data points be denoted as $(x_k, y_k)$ for $k = 1, \\dots, n$, where $n=6$ is the number of plots, $x_k$ is the predator density $N_j$ in the $k$-th plot, and $y_k$ is the corresponding log-abundance of the mussel, $\\ln N_i$. The OLS estimator for the slope, $\\hat{\\beta}_1$, is given by the formula:\n$$ \\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{n} (x_k - \\bar{x})(y_k - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{k=1}^{n} (x_k - \\bar{x})^2} $$\nwhere $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$ are the sample means of the $x_k$ and $y_k$ values, respectively.

The dynamic interaction strength is estimated to be $-0.18$ per predator individual. Rounding to four significant figures gives $-0.1800$.\n\n3. Interpretation\n\nThe computed dynamic interaction strength is $-0.1800$ per predator individual.\n- **Keystone Assessment**: The problem defines a keystone predator (in this context) as one for which the magnitude of the dynamic interaction strength is at least $0.12$. The magnitude of our computed strength is $|-0.1800| = 0.1800$. Since $0.1800 \\ge 0.12$, the predator sea star qualifies as a keystone species under the stated criterion, exercising a strong per capita effect on the mussel population over the $60$-day period.\n\n- **Sign and Indirect Effect**: The negative sign of the interaction strength ($\\hat{\\beta}_1 = -0.1800$) confirms that the direct effect of the predator on the mussel is negative. That is, an increase in predator density $N_j$ causes a decrease in the consumer (mussel) density $N_i$. This is characteristic of a predator-prey relationship.\n\nThe problem states that the mussel, in turn, has a negative effect on the basal algal resource (\"reduces cover of a basal algal resource\"). The indirect effect of the predator on the algae is determined by the pathway:\nPredator ($j$) $\\xrightarrow{\\text{direct, negative}}$ Mussel ($i$) $\\xrightarrow{\\text{direct, negative}}$ Algae (Basal Resource)\n\nThe sign of the indirect effect is the product of the signs of the direct effects along the chain: $(-)\\times(-) = (+)$. Therefore, the predator has a positive indirect effect on the basal algal resource. By preying on mussels, the sea star reduces the grazing pressure on the algae, leading to an increase in algal cover. This phenomenon, where a top predator positively affects a primary producer by controlling the herbivore population, is a classic example of a trophic cascade.\nThe calculation thus supports the hypothesis that the sea star induces a trophic cascade.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.1800}$$", "id": "2541665"}, {"introduction": "Trophic interactions are not limited to consumption alone; the non-lethal effects of predators can be just as important.

We seek the threshold value $\\beta = \\beta^{\\ast}$ where this sign changes, which occurs when $\\frac{\\partial R^{\\ast}}{\\partial P} = 0$.\nWe use the quotient rule to differentiate $R^{\\ast}(P) = \\frac{N(P)}{D(P)}$, where:\n$$ N(P) = m_0 + (\\beta \\gamma + b)P - b \\gamma P^2 $$\n$$ D(P) = e a (1 - \\alpha \\gamma P) $$\nThe derivatives are:\n$$ N'(P) = \\frac{d N}{dP} = \\beta \\gamma + b - 2b \\gamma P $$\n$$ D'(P) = \\frac{d D}{dP} = -e a \\alpha \\gamma $$\nThe derivative of $R^{\\ast}$ is $\\frac{\\partial R^{\\ast}}{\\partial P} = \\frac{N'(P)D(P) - N(P)D'(P)}{[D(P)]^2}$. The sign is determined by the numerator, as $[D(P)]^2  0$.\nThe numerator is:\n$$ N'(P)D(P) - N(P)D'(P) = (\\beta \\gamma + b - 2b \\gamma P)[e a (1 - \\alpha \\gamma P)] - (m_0 + (\\beta \\gamma + b)P - b \\gamma P^2)[-e a \\alpha \\gamma] $$\nFactoring out the common term $e a$:\n$$ = e a \\left[ (\\beta \\gamma + b - 2b \\gamma P)(1 - \\alpha \\gamma P) + \\alpha \\gamma (m_0 + (\\beta \\gamma + b)P - b \\gamma P^2) \\right] $$\nExpanding the terms inside the brackets:\n$$ = e a \\left[ (\\beta \\gamma + b - 2b \\gamma P - \\alpha\\beta\\gamma^2 P - \\alpha b \\gamma P + 2\\alpha b \\gamma^2 P^2) + (\\alpha\\gamma m_0 + \\alpha\\beta\\gamma^2 P + \\alpha b\\gamma P - \\alpha b \\gamma^2 P^2) \\right] $$\nSimplifying by cancellation:\n$$ = e a [\\beta \\gamma + b - 2b \\gamma P + \\alpha \\gamma m_0 + \\alpha b \\gamma^2 P^2] $$\nThe sign change occurs when this expression is zero. We set the term in the brackets to zero and solve for $\\beta$, which we denote as $\\beta^{\\ast}$:\n$$ \\beta^{\\ast} \\gamma + b - 2b \\gamma P + \\alpha \\gamma m_0 + \\alpha b \\gamma^2 P^2 = 0 $$\n$$ \\beta^{\\ast} \\gamma = 2b \\gamma P - b - \\alpha \\gamma m_0 - \\alpha b \\gamma^2 P^2 $$\n$$ \\beta^{\\ast} = \\frac{2b \\gamma P - b - \\alpha \\gamma m_0 - \\alpha b \\gamma^2 P^2}{\\gamma} $$\n$$ \\beta^{\\ast} = 2b P - \\frac{b}{\\gamma} - \\alpha m_0 - \\alpha b \\gamma P^2 $$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the threshold value $\\beta^{\\ast}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{2bP - \\frac{b}{\\gamma} - \\alpha m_0 - \\alpha b \\gamma P^2} $$", "id": "2541628"}]}
