Compute the equilibrium abundance of species $1$, $N_1$, rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem is evaluated against the required criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The Lotka-Volterra model is a cornerstone of theoretical ecology. The problem is firmly rooted in established scientific principles.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a complete set of equations and parameters, and asks for a standard stability analysis and equilibrium calculation. A unique and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The language is precise and mathematical, free from subjectivity.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** All information required for the analysis is provided. There are no contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a well-formulated, standard problem in mathematical biology. We proceed to the solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the general conditions for coexistence. The equilibria of the system are found by setting the time derivatives to zero: $\\frac{dN_1}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dN_2}{dt} = 0$. This yields four possible equilibria:\n1.  The trivial equilibrium: $(N_1, N_2) = (0, 0)$.\n2.  Exclusion of species $2$: $(N_1, N_2) = (K_1, 0)$.\n3.  Exclusion of species $1$: $(N_1, N_2) = (0, K_2)$.\n4.  The coexistence equilibrium, where $N_1  0$ and $N_2  0$. This equilibrium, denoted $(N_1^*, N_2^*)$, is found by solving the system of linear equations for the non-trivial nullclines (isoclines):\n    $$\n    N_1 + \\alpha_{12} N_2 = K_1\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\alpha_{21} N_1 + N_2 = K_2\n    $$\nSolving this system, for instance by using Cramer's rule or substitution, yields the coordinates of the internal equilibrium point:\n$$\nN_1^* = \\frac{K_1 - \\alpha_{12} K_2}{1 - \\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21}}\n$$\n$$\nN_2^* = \\frac{K_2 - \\alpha_{21} K_1}{1 - \\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21}}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the coexistence equilibrium. For this equilibrium to be biologically meaningful, we must have $N_1^*  0$ and $N_2^*  0$.\n\nThe stability of this system, and thus the long-term outcome, is determined by the mutual invasibility conditions. These conditions ascertain whether each species can increase from low numbers when its competitor is at its carrying capacity.\n- **Invasion by species 1:** Can species $1$ invade when species $2$ is at its carrying capacity, $N_2=K_2$? We evaluate $\\frac{dN_1}{dt}$ at $(N_1, N_2) \\approx (0, K_2)$. The growth rate of species $1$ is positive if:\n  $$\n  1 - \\frac{\\alpha_{12} K_2}{K_1}  0 \\implies K_1  \\alpha_{12} K_2\n  $$\n- **Invasion by species 2:** Can species $2$ invade when species $1$ is at its carrying capacity, $N_1=K_1$? We evaluate $\\frac{dN_2}{dt}$ at $(N_1, N_2) \\approx (K_1, 0)$. The growth rate of species $2$ is positive if:\n  $$\n  1 - \\frac{\\alpha_{21} K_1}{K_2}  0 \\implies K_2  \\alpha_{21} K_1\n  $$\nThese two inequalities, $K_1  \\alpha_{12} K_2$ and $K_2  \\alpha_{21} K_1$, are the **mutual invasibility conditions**. If both are met, the boundary equilibria $(K_1, 0)$ and $(0, K_2)$ are unstable, and the system converges to a stable coexistence equilibrium.\nThese conditions have a clear biological interpretation related to **limiting similarity**: each species must inhibit its own growth more strongly than it inhibits the growth of its competitor. The strength of intraspecific competition is scaled to $1$ (in units of $1/K_i$), while interspecific competition is scaled by $\\alpha_{ij}$. Thus, for stable coexistence, interspecific competition must be weaker than intraspecific competition. Note that these two conditions together imply $K_1 K_2  (\\alpha_{12} K_2)(\\alpha_{21} K_1)$, which simplifies to $1  \\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21}$. This means that for the coexistence equilibrium $(N_1^*, N_2^*)$ to be both positive and stable, the numerators and the denominator in its expressions must all be positive.\n\nNow, we apply this framework to the given parameter set:\n- Parameters: $K_1 = 100$, $K_2 = 80$, $\\alpha_{12} = 0.6$, $\\alpha_{21} = 0.7$.\n- We check the mutual invasibility conditions:\n1.  Is $K_1  \\alpha_{12} K_2$?\n    $$\n    100  0.6 \\times 80 \\implies 100  48\n    $$\n    This condition is satisfied.\n2.  Is $K_2  \\alpha_{21} K_1$?\n    $$\n    80  0.7 \\times 100 \\implies 80  70\n    $$\n    This condition is also satisfied.\n\nSince both mutual invasibility conditions are met, the long-term outcome is **stable coexistence**, not competitive exclusion. The globally attracting equilibrium for any positive initial densities is the interior equilibrium $(N_1^*, N_2^*)$.\n\nFinally, we compute the equilibrium abundance for species $1$, $N_1^*$. Using the formula derived earlier:\n$$\nN_1^* = \\frac{K_1 - \\alpha_{12} K_2}{1 - \\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nN_1^* = \\frac{100 - (0.6)(80)}{1 - (0.6)(0.7)}\n$$\n$$\nN_1^* = \\frac{100 - 48}{1 - 0.42}\n$$\n$$\nN_1^* = \\frac{52}{0.58}\n$$\n$$\nN_1^* \\approx 89.65517...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$\nN_1^* \\approx 89.66\n$$\nThe abundance of species $1$ at the globally attracting equilibrium is $89.66$ individuals.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{89.66}\n$$", "id": "2478549"}, {"introduction": "Building on the classical model, this practice connects the Lotka-Volterra equations to the powerful framework of Modern Coexistence Theory.

Each species must be able to achieve a positive per-capita growth rate when it is rare and the other species is at its single-species equilibrium (i.e., its carrying capacity).\n\n1.  Invasion of species $1$ into a population of species $2$ at equilibrium ($N_2 = K_2$):\n    The per-capita growth rate of species $1$ as it invades is:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{N_1} \\frac{dN_1}{dt} \\bigg|_{N_1 \\to 0, N_2 = K_2} = r_1 \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\alpha_{12} K_2}{K_1} \\right) $$\n    For successful invasion, this rate must be positive. Since $r_1  0$, this requires:\n    $$ 1 - \\frac{\\alpha_{12} K_2}{K_1}  0 \\implies K_1  \\alpha_{12} K_2 $$\n\n2.  Invasion of species $2$ into a population of species $1$ at equilibrium ($N_1 = K_1$):\n    Similarly, the per-capita growth rate of species $2$ as it invades is:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{N_2} \\frac{dN_2}{dt} \\bigg|_{N_2 \\to 0, N_1 = K_1} = r_2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\alpha_{21} K_1}{K_2} \\right) $$\n    For successful invasion, we need:\n    $$ 1 - \\frac{\\alpha_{21} K_1}{K_2}  0 \\implies K_2  \\alpha_{21} K_1 $$\n\nThe problem specifies a \"symmetric case\" where the interspecific competition coefficients are equal. It also introduces a \"niche-overlap parameter $\\rho$\". In the context of the symmetric Lotka-Volterra model, this implies $\\alpha_{12} = \\alpha_{21} = \\rho$. The two invasion criteria can thus be rewritten in terms of $\\rho$:\n$$ K_1  \\rho K_2 \\implies \\rho  \\frac{K_1}{K_2} $$\n$$ K_2  \\rho K_1 \\implies \\rho  \\frac{K_2}{K_1} $$\n\nThe problem introduces an \"average fitness ratio\" $f_{2}/f_{1}  1$, indicating that species $2$ is the superior competitor. In the context of this simplified model, where the only source of competitive asymmetry is in the carrying capacities, it is standard to define this fitness ratio as the ratio of the carrying capacities. Thus, we set:\n$$ \\frac{f_2}{f_1} = \\frac{K_2}{K_1} $$\nSince $f_2/f_1  1$, it follows that $K_2  K_1$.\n\nFor coexistence, both invasion inequalities must be satisfied. Given that $K_2  K_1$, the ratio $K_1/K_2$ is less than $1$, while the ratio $K_2/K_1$ is greater than $1$. As $\\rho \\in (0,1)$, the condition $\\rho  K_2/K_1$ is less restrictive than $\\rho  K_1/K_2$. Therefore, the limiting condition for coexistence is determined by the ability of the weaker competitor (species $1$) to invade the stronger one (species $2$). This single condition is:\n$$ \\rho  \\frac{K_1}{K_2} $$\n\nAccording to modern coexistence theory, this inequality states that the niche overlap ($\\rho$) must be less than a \"stabilizing bound\" that is determined by the fitness difference. The stabilizing bound is the maximum tolerable niche overlap that still allows for coexistence. From our inequality, this bound is $K_1/K_2$.\n$$ \\text{Stabilizing Bound} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2} $$\nWe can express this bound in terms of the given fitness ratio:\n$$ \\text{Stabilizing Bound} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-1} = \\left(\\frac{f_2}{f_1}\\right)^{-1} $$\n\nThe problem defines the coexistence margin, $M$, as the difference between this stabilizing bound and the observed niche overlap, $\\rho$.\n$$ M = (\\text{Stabilizing Bound}) - \\rho $$\nSubstituting our derived expression for the stabilizing bound gives the formula for $M$ in terms of the given parameters:\n$$ M = \\left(\\frac{f_2}{f_1}\\right)^{-1} - \\rho $$\n\nNow, we compute the value of $M$ for the specific case where $\\rho = 0.6$ and $f_2/f_1 = 1.3$. To ensure an exact answer, we convert these decimal values to fractions:\n$$ \\rho = 0.6 = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5} $$\n$$ \\frac{f_2}{f_1} = 1.3 = \\frac{13}{10} $$\nSubstitute these fractional values into the expression for $M$:\n$$ M = \\left(\\frac{13}{10}\\right)^{-1} - \\frac{3}{5} $$\n$$ M = \\frac{10}{13} - \\frac{3}{5} $$\nTo subtract the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $13 \\times 5 = 65$.\n$$ M = \\frac{10 \\times 5}{13 \\times 5} - \\frac{3 \\times 13}{5 \\times 13} $$\n$$ M = \\frac{50}{65} - \\frac{39}{65} $$\n$$ M = \\frac{50 - 39}{65} $$\n$$ M = \\frac{11}{65} $$\nThe fraction is in its simplest form, as $11$ is a prime number and $65$ is not a multiple of $11$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{11}{65}}$$", "id": "2478538"}, {"introduction": "This final practice shifts from phenomenological models to a mechanistic one, exploring competitive exclusion from the perspective of resource consumption.

A coexistence equilibrium $R^{\\ast}$ must be a point that lies on all four hyperplanes simultaneously. A fundamental principle of linear algebra dictates that a system of $n$ linear equations in $k$ unknowns, where $n  k$, generally has no solution. A solution can only exist if the equations are not linearly independent. Specifically, the number of linearly independent consumption vectors cannot exceed the number of resources. Since we have $4$ consumer species and $3$ resources, the four consumption vectors $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, c_{4}$ must be linearly dependent for coexistence to be possible.\n\nWe must find a non-zero coefficient vector $a = (a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4})$ such that $\\sum_{i=1}^{4} a_{i} c_{i} = 0$. The vectors $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}$ are linearly independent as the determinant of the matrix formed by them is $\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  1 \\\\ 0  1  1 \\\\ 1  1  0 \\end{pmatrix} = 1(0-1) - 0(0-1) + 1(0-1) = -2 \\neq 0$.

This vector has integer entries, its greatest common divisor is $\\text{gcd}(1, 1, 1, -1) = 1$, and its last entry is negative ($a_{4} = -1$), satisfying all conditions specified in the problem.\n\nFor the system of linear equations to be consistent, the same linear dependency must apply to the constant terms on the right-hand side. That is, it must be true that $\\sum_{i=1}^{4} a_{i} \\frac{m_{i}}{e_{i}} = 0$. The problem defines this sum as the inconsistency residual, $S$. If $S=0$, the system is consistent; if $S \\neq 0$, it is inconsistent and no solution exists.\nWe compute $S$:\n$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} a_{i} \\frac{m_{i}}{e_{i}} = a_{1}\\frac{m_{1}}{e_{1}} + a_{2}\\frac{m_{2}}{e_{2}} + a_{3}\\frac{m_{3}}{e_{3}} + a_{4}\\frac{m_{4}}{e_{4}}$\nSubstituting the values for $a_i$ and $\\frac{m_{i}}{e_{i}}$:\n$S = (1)(2) + (1)(2) + (1)(2) + (-1)(5)$\n$S = 2 + 2 + 2 - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1$.\n\nSince $S = 1 \\neq 0$, the system of equations is inconsistent.
