Whether species $2$ can invade the single-species equilibrium of species $1$.\n\nThe invasion condition for an invader $j$ at a resident $i$'s equilibrium resource state $\\mathbf{R}^{\\text{eq}}_i = (R^{\\text{eq}}_{i,1}, R^{\\text{eq}}_{i,2})$ is $\\mu_j(\\mathbf{R}^{\\text{eq}}_i)  m_j$. Given the growth law, this is equivalent to $\\min\\{\\mu_{j1}(R^{\\text{eq}}_{i,1}), \\mu_{j2}(R^{\\text{eq}}_{i,2})\\}  m_j$. This inequality holds if and only if both $\\mu_{j1}(R^{\\text{eq}}_{i,1})  m_j$ and $\\mu_{j2}(R^{\\text{eq}}_{i,2})  m_j$. Since the functions $\\mu_{ij}$ are strictly increasing, these are equivalent to $R^{\\text{eq}}_{i,1}  R^{*}_{j1}$ and $R^{\\text{eq}}_{i,2}  R^{*}_{j2}$.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the case of species $2$ invading species $1$'s equilibrium. For this, we must determine $\\mathbf{R}^{\\text{eq}}_1$.\nThe ZNGI for species $1$ is the L-shaped boundary defined by the lines $R_1 = R^{*}_{11} = 0.25$ and $R_2 = R^{*}_{12} = 0.50$. The equilibrium resource state $\\mathbf{R}^{\\text{eq}}_1$ is the first point on the resource depletion ray that intersects this ZNGI. The ray starts at $\\mathbf{S}=(1.0, 1.0)$ and moves along the direction $-\\mathbf{c}_1 = (-0.2, -0.8)$.\nThe equation of the ray is $\\mathbf{R}(q) = (1.0 - 0.2q, 1.0 - 0.8q)$ for $q \\geq 0$.\nWe find the value of the parameter $q$ at which the ray intersects each of the two lines of the ZNGI:\n- Intersection with $R_1 = 0.25$: $1.0 - 0.2q = 0.25 \\implies 0.2q = 0.75 \\implies q_1 = \\frac{0.75}{0.2} = 3.75$.\n- Intersection with $R_2 = 0.50$: $1.0 - 0.8q = 0.50 \\implies 0.8q = 0.50 \\implies q_2 = \\frac{0.50}{0.8} = 0.625$.\nThe first intersection occurs at the smaller non-negative $q$, which is $q = q_2 = 0.625$. At this value of $q$, the resource levels are:\n$R_1 = 1.0 - 0.2(0.625) = 1.0 - 0.125 = 0.875$.\n$R_2 = 1.0 - 0.8(0.625) = 1.0 - 0.5 = 0.50$.\nSo, $\\mathbf{R}^{\\text{eq}}_1 = (0.875, 0.50)$. At this point, $R_1 = 0.875  R^{*}_{11} = 0.25$, which confirms it is on the correct portion of the ZNGI. Species $1$ is limited by resource $2$.\n\nNow, we check if species $2$ can invade at $\\mathbf{R}^{\\text{eq}}_1 = (0.875, 0.50)$. The conditions are:\n1. $R^{\\text{eq}}_{1,1}  R^{*}_{21} \\implies 0.875  0.60$. This is true.\n2. $R^{\\text{eq}}_{1,2}  R^{*}_{22} \\implies 0.50  0.20$. This is also true.\nSince both conditions are met, species $2$ can invade the equilibrium of species $1$. Therefore, the variable $x_2$ in the final answer is $1$.\n\nNext, let us analyze the case of species $1$ invading species $2$'s equilibrium. We must determine $\\mathbf{R}^{\\text{eq}}_2$.\nThe ZNGI for species $2$ is defined by $R_1 = R^{*}_{21} = 0.60$ and $R_2 = R^{*}_{22} = 0.20$. The depletion ray starts at $\\mathbf{S}=(1.0, 1.0)$ and moves along $-\\mathbf{c}_2 = (-0.9, -0.3)$.\nThe equation of the ray is $\\mathbf{R}(q) = (1.0 - 0.9q, 1.0 - 0.3q)$ for $q \\geq 0$.\nWe find the value of $q$ for intersection with the ZNGI lines:\n- Intersection with $R_1 = 0.60$: $1.0 - 0.9q = 0.60 \\implies 0.9q = 0.40 \\implies q_1 = \\frac{0.4}{0.9} = \\frac{4}{9}$.\n- Intersection with $R_2 = 0.20$: $1.0 - 0.3q = 0.20 \\implies 0.3q = 0.80 \\implies q_2 = \\frac{0.8}{0.3} = \\frac{8}{3}$.\nThe first intersection occurs at the smaller $q$, which is $q = q_1 = \\frac{4}{9}$. At this $q$, the resource levels are:\n$R_1 = 1.0 - 0.9(\\frac{4}{9}) = 1.0 - 0.4 = 0.60$.\n$R_2 = 1.0 - 0.3(\\frac{4}{9}) = 1.0 - \\frac{1.2}{9} = 1.0 - \\frac{12}{90} = 1.0 - \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{13}{15}$.\nSo, $\\mathbf{R}^{\\text{eq}}_2 = (0.60, \\frac{13}{15})$. At this point, $R_2 = \\frac{13}{15} \\approx 0.867  R^{*}_{22} = 0.20$, confirming it's on the correct part of the ZNGI. Species $2$ is limited by resource $1$.\n\nNow, we check if species $1$ can invade at $\\mathbf{R}^{\\text{eq}}_2 = (0.60, \\frac{13}{15})$. The conditions are:\n1. $R^{\\text{eq}}_{2,1}  R^{*}_{11} \\implies 0.60  0.25$. This is true.\n2. $R^{\\text{eq}}_{2,2}  R^{*}_{12} \\implies \\frac{13}{15}  0.50$. Since $0.50 = \\frac{7.5}{15}$, the inequality $\\frac{13}{15}  \\frac{7.5}{15}$ is true.\nSince both conditions are met, species $1$ can invade the equilibrium of species $2$. Therefore, the variable $x_1$ in the final answer is $1$.\n\nIn summary, species $1$ can invade species $2$'s equilibrium ($x_1=1$) and species $2$ can invade species $1$'s equilibrium ($x_2=1$). This situation is known as mutual invasibility and leads to stable coexistence.\n\nThe final answer is to be reported as a $1 \\times 2$ row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} x_1  x_2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nWith $x_1=1$ and $x_2=1$, the matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2499454"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical predictions of competition must be tested with empirical data, which requires careful experimental design.

This relationship is fundamentally non-linear and saturating. A standard representation is the Monod model for nutrient-limited growth, combined with a constant loss rate (dilution rate $D$ in a chemostat):\n$$g_i(R) = \\mu_{max, i} \\frac{R}{K_i + R} - D$$\nwhere $\\mu_{max, i}$ is the maximum specific growth rate and $K_i$ is the half-saturation constant for resource uptake.\n\nThe condition of resource limitation, $\\frac{\\partial g_i}{\\partial R}  0$, is satisfied for this function, as its first derivative is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial g_i}{\\partial R} = \\frac{\\mu_{max, i} K_i}{(K_i + R)^2}  0$$\nCritically, the second derivative is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 g_i}{\\partial R^2} = -2\\frac{\\mu_{max, i} K_i}{(K_i + R)^3}  0$$\nThis indicates that the function $g_i(R)$ is strictly concave. This mathematical property is central to the analysis. A concave function means that for a fixed increase in the resource concentration, $\\Delta R$, the corresponding increase in the growth rate, $\\Delta g_i$, is smaller at higher baseline levels of $R$.\n\nThe experiment has four treatments, which we can denote by the levels of the two factors (A: Resource +/-; B: Competitor j +/-):\n1.  Control: Resource level `control`, Competitor `present`. Let the corresponding resource concentration be $R_{--}$ and growth rate be $g_{--}$.\n2.  R-addition: Resource level `added`, Competitor `present`. Resource concentration $R_{+-}$, growth rate $g_{+-}$.\n3.  Competitor-removal: Resource level `control`, Competitor `removed`. Resource concentration $R_{-+}$, growth rate $g_{-+}$.\n4.  R-addition + Competitor-removal: Resource level `added`, Competitor `removed`. Resource concentration $R_{++}$, growth rate $g_{++}$.\n\nThe hypothesis is that competition from $j$ is exploitative via $R$. This means both experimental manipulations affect $g_i$ through the same mechanism: changing the concentration of $R$.\n-   **Resource addition**: Increases the supply rate of $R$, thus increasing its ambient concentration. Therefore, $R_{+-}  R_{--}$ and $R_{++}  R_{-+}$.\n-   **Competitor removal**: Eliminates the consumption of $R$ by species $j$, thus increasing its ambient concentration. Therefore, $R_{-+}  R_{--}$ and $R_{++}  R_{+-}$.\n\nCombining these, we have an ordering of resource concentrations across treatments:\n$$R_{--}  R_{+-}, R_{-+}  R_{++}$$\n\nAn interaction between the two factors exists if the effect of one factor depends on the level of the other. Let us examine the effect of resource addition in the absence and presence of the competitor $j$.\n-   Effect of R-addition with $j$ present: $\\Delta g_{i, j\\_present} = g_{+-} - g_{--}$. This is the change in growth rate over the resource interval $[R_{--}, R_{+-}]$.\n-   Effect of R-addition with $j$ removed: $\\Delta g_{i, j\\_removed} = g_{++} - g_{-+}$. This is the change in growth rate over the resource interval $[R_{-+}, R_{++}]$.\n\nSince removing the competitor increases the resource concentration, the baseline resource level is higher when $j$ is removed: $R_{-+}  R_{--}$. Because the function $g_i(R)$ is concave, the response to resource addition will be diminished at this higher baseline resource level. Mathematically:\n$$g_{++} - g_{-+}  g_{+-} - g_{--}$$\nThis inequality signifies a statistical interaction. Specifically, it describes an **antagonistic interaction** (also termed sub-additive), where the combined effect of the two treatments is less than the sum of their individual effects.\n\nTo verify this, we compare the combined effect with the sum of single effects, all relative to the control treatment ($g_{--}$):\n-   Sum of single effects: $E_{sum} = (g_{+-} - g_{--}) + (g_{-+} - g_{--})$.\n-   Observed combined effect: $E_{obs} = g_{++} - g_{--}$.\n\nSub-additivity implies $E_{obs}  E_{sum}$, which is:\n$$g_{++} - g_{--}  (g_{+-} - g_{--}) + (g_{-+} - g_{--})$$\nRearranging this inequality gives:\n$$g_{++} + g_{--}  g_{+-} + g_{-+}$$\nThis is the standard definition of an antagonistic interaction in a $2 \\times 2$ factorial analysis. This is the expected signature for two factors that alleviate the same single limitation pathway governed by a saturating response curve.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. This option proposes purely additive main effects. This would mean $g_{++} + g_{--} = g_{+-} + g_{-+}$. As derived above, this is incorrect because the response of growth rate to the resource is non-linear (concave). The illustration values ($0.02, 0.06, 0.10, 0.14$) show perfect additivity: $(0.14 - 0.10) - (0.06 - 0.02) = 0.04 - 0.04 = 0$. This pattern would suggest that $g_i$ is a linear function of $R$, which is biologically unrealistic. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\nB. This option correctly predicts an antagonistic (sub-additive) interaction where the combined effect is less than the sum of the single effects. The reasoning provided is sound: \"both manipulations act on the same limiting pathway.\" It also correctly states that the resource addition effect is larger when the competitor is present because the resource level is lower. The provided illustration ($g_{--} = -0.02$, $g_{+-} = 0.10$, $g_{-+} = 0.08$, $g_{++} = 0.12$) is consistent with this prediction. Let us check the calculation: The sum of single effects relative to the baseline is $(0.10 - (-0.02)) + (0.08 - (-0.02)) = 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.22$. The combined effect is $0.12 - (-0.02) = 0.14$. Since $0.14  0.22$, this is indeed a sub-additive or antagonistic interaction. The effect of $R$ addition is $0.12$ when $j$ is present, and $0.12 - 0.08 = 0.04$ when $j$ is removed. The effect is larger when $j$ is present. This option is fully consistent with the theoretical derivation. Therefore, this option is **Correct**.\n\nC. This option proposes a synergistic interaction, where the combined effect exceeds the sum of single effects ($g_{++} + g_{--}  g_{+-} + g_{-+}$). This pattern typically arises when two factors alleviate separate, co-limiting pathways (e.g., limitation by both a nutrient and light). This is not the scenario described in the problem, which specifies competition for a single resource $R$. The illustration confirms synergy ($0.15 + 0.02  0.03 + 0.04$, or $0.17  0.07$), but the underlying ecological hypothesis is incorrect for this problem setup. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\nD. This option proposes no main effect of resource addition. This would imply that $\\frac{\\partial g_i}{\\partial R} = 0$, meaning the resource $R$ is not limiting. This directly contradicts the premise of the hypothesis being tested (\"that $R$ limits $i$\"). This experimental outcome would falsify, not support, the hypothesis. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2499403"}]}
