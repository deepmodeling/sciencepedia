A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe instantaneous rate of change of the mean trait, $\\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}/\\mathrm{d}t$, is described by the continuous-time Price equation. In the absence of transmission bias (Assumption iii), this equation states that the rate of evolution due to selection is equal to the covariance between the trait value and Malthusian fitness. For a trait with a heritable component, the response to selection is governed by the breeder's equation. In its continuous-time form, Lande's equation gives the rate of change of the mean trait as the product of the additive genetic variance and the selection gradient:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = G \\beta_s\n$$\nHere, $G$ is the additive genetic variance, as given in Assumption (i). For an asexual population, all genetic variance is additive. The selection gradient, $\\beta_s$, is defined as the partial derivative of the mean Malthusian fitness, $\\bar{m}$, with respect to the mean trait, $\\bar{z}$:\n$$\n\\beta_s = \\frac{\\partial \\bar{m}}{\\partial \\bar{z}}\n$$\nThis formulation is accurate under the given assumptions of a normal trait distribution (ii) and weak selection (iv).\n\nFirst, we define the Malthusian fitness, $m(z_i, N)$, as the natural logarithm of the absolute fitness, $w(z_i, N)$:\n$$\nm(z_i, N) = \\ln(w(z_i, N)) = \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(\\gamma z_{i}-\\beta N-\\frac{\\delta}{2}z_{i}^{2}\\right)\\right) = \\gamma z_i - \\beta N - \\frac{\\delta}{2}z_i^2\n$$\nNext, we calculate the mean Malthusian fitness, $\\bar{m}$, by taking the expectation of $m(z_i, N)$ over the population's trait distribution. Assumption (ii) states this distribution is normal with mean $\\bar{z}$ and variance $P$. As the population is asexual and the trait is determined additively, the phenotypic variance $P$ is equal to the additive genetic variance $G$. Thus, $z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\bar{z}, G)$.\n$$\n\\bar{m} = \\text{E}[m(z, N)] = \\text{E}\\left[\\gamma z - \\beta N - \\frac{\\delta}{2}z^2\\right]\n$$\nBy the linearity of expectation:\n$$\n\\bar{m} = \\gamma \\text{E}[z] - \\beta N - \\frac{\\delta}{2}\\text{E}[z^2]\n$$\nFor a random variable $z$ with mean $\\bar{z}$ and variance $G$, we have $\\text{E}[z] = \\bar{z}$ and $\\text{E}[z^2] = \\text{Var}(z) + (\\text{E}[z])^2 = G + \\bar{z}^2$. Substituting these into the expression for $\\bar{m}$:\n$$\n\\bar{m}(\\bar{z}, N, G) = \\gamma \\bar{z} - \\beta N - \\frac{\\delta}{2}(G + \\bar{z}^2)\n$$\nNow, we compute the selection gradient $\\beta_s$ by differentiating $\\bar{m}$ with respect to $\\bar{z}$. We treat $G$ and $N$ as parameters that do not vary with $\\bar{z}$ for this partial derivative.\n$$\n\\beta_s = \\frac{\\partial \\bar{m}}{\\partial \\bar{z}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}}\\left(\\gamma \\bar{z} - \\beta N - \\frac{\\delta}{2}G - \\frac{\\delta}{2}\\bar{z}^2\\right)\n$$\nThe terms $-\\beta N$ and $-\\frac{\\delta}{2}G$ are constant with respect to $\\bar{z}$, so their derivatives are zero.\n$$\n\\beta_s = \\gamma - \\delta \\bar{z}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for the selection gradient into Lande's equation to find the evolutionary response:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = G \\beta_s = G(\\gamma - \\delta \\bar{z})\n$$\nThis is the instantaneous evolutionary response of the mean trait.\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of how $\\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}/\\mathrm{d}t$ depends on the population density $N$. Examining the derived expression, $\\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}/\\mathrm{d}t = G(\\gamma - \\delta \\bar{z})$, it is evident that it does not contain the variable $N$. The rate of evolutionary change of the mean trait is independent of the current population density. This is because the density-dependent term in the fitness function, $-\\beta N$, is additive in the Malthusian fitness scale. It acts as a uniform pressure on all individuals regardless of their trait value $z_i$. Consequently, it affects the population's mean growth rate (an ecological effect) but does not alter the fitness differences between phenotypes, and therefore does not generate a selective pressure on the trait $z$ itself. The evolutionary dynamics of $\\bar{z}$ are driven solely by the part of selection that is a function of $z_i$, which in this case is the stabilizing selection component $\\gamma z_i - \\frac{\\delta}{2}z_i^2$. This decoupling of the instantaneous evolutionary rate of the trait from population density is a specific consequence of the additive structure of the Malthusian fitness function.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{G(\\gamma - \\delta\\bar{z})}\n$$", "id": "2481855"}, {"introduction": "With an understanding of how traits evolve, we can now explore the other half of the feedback loop: how does evolution alter ecological properties?

This is defined as $S_{\\mathrm{crit}} = R^{*}(\\hat{e})$, where $R^{*}(\\hat{e})$ is the equilibrium resource concentration corresponding to the evolutionarily singular uptake strategy $\\hat{e}$. The derivation proceeds in three parts as specified.\n\nFirst, we determine the resident's ecological equilibrium. An equilibrium state $(\\frac{dR}{dt}=0, \\frac{dB}{dt}=0)$ with a persistent consumer population ($B  0$) requires the per-capita growth rate of the consumer to be zero. From the biomass dynamics equation,\n$$ \\frac{dB}{dt} = \\big(y(e)\\,e\\,R - (m + D)\\big)\\,B = 0, $$\nfor a non-trivial equilibrium where the biomass density $B^{*}  0$, we must have:\n$$ y(e)\\,e\\,R^{*}(e) - (m + D) = 0. $$\nSolving for the equilibrium nutrient concentration $R^{*}(e)$ that just allows the resident population with trait $e$ to persist, we find:\n$$ R^{*}(e) = \\frac{m + D}{y(e)\\,e}. $$\nThis is the well-known $R^{*}$ value for the consumer. For the population to have a positive biomass, its equilibrium density $B^{*}(e)$ must be greater than zero. We find $B^{*}(e)$ by setting the nutrient dynamics to zero at this equilibrium:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = D\\,(S - R^{*}(e)) - e\\,B^{*}(e)\\,R^{*}(e) = 0. $$\n$$ B^{*}(e) = \\frac{D\\,(S - R^{*}(e))}{e\\,R^{*}(e)}. $$\nSince all parameters $D$, $e$, and the concentration $R^{*}(e)$ are positive, the viability condition for a positive biomass, $B^{*}(e)  0$, simplifies to:\n$$ S  R^{*}(e). $$\nThis means the inflow nutrient concentration must be higher than the level to which the consumer depletes it.\n\nSecond, we find the evolutionarily singular strategy, $\\hat{e}$. This is the trait value at which the selection gradient is zero. The selection gradient, $\\mathcal{D}(e)$, is the derivative of the invasion fitness of a mutant $s(e', e)$ with respect to the mutant trait $e'$, evaluated at the resident trait $e$. The invasion fitness is given as:\n$$ s(e',e) = y(e')\\,e'\\,R^{*}(e) - (m + D). $$\nThe selection gradient is therefore:\n$$ \\mathcal{D}(e) = \\left. \\frac{\\partial s(e',e)}{\\partial e'} \\right|_{e'=e} = \\left. \\frac{d}{de'} \\left( y(e')e' \\right) \\right|_{e'=e} R^{*}(e). $$\nWe are given the trade-off function $y(e) = y_{0} - a\\,e$. Let us define the function $f(e) = y(e)e$.\n$$ f(e) = (y_{0} - a\\,e)e = y_{0}e - ae^{2}. $$\nThe derivative of this function is:\n$$ f'(e) = \\frac{d}{de}(y_{0}e - ae^{2}) = y_{0} - 2ae. $$\nThe selection gradient is thus:\n$$ \\mathcal{D}(e) = (y_{0} - 2ae)R^{*}(e). $$\nA singular strategy $\\hat{e}$ is a value of $e$ for which $\\mathcal{D}(\\hat{e}) = 0$.

We use our previously derived expression for $R^{*}(e)$:\n$$ R^{*}(e) = \\frac{m + D}{y(e)e} = \\frac{m + D}{f(e)}. $$\nWe must evaluate the denominator, $f(e) = y(e)e$, at $e=\\hat{e}$:\n$$ f(\\hat{e}) = y(\\hat{e})\\hat{e} = \\left( y_{0} - a\\hat{e} \\right) \\hat{e}. $$\nSubstituting $\\hat{e} = \\frac{y_{0}}{2a}$:\n$$ f(\\hat{e}) = \\left( y_{0} - a\\left(\\frac{y_{0}}{2a}\\right) \\right) \\left(\\frac{y_{0}}{2a}\\right) = \\left( y_{0} - \\frac{y_{0}}{2} \\right) \\left(\\frac{y_{0}}{2a}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{y_{0}}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{y_{0}}{2a}\\right) = \\frac{y_{0}^{2}}{4a}. $$\nNow, we can find $S_{\\mathrm{crit}} = R^{*}(\\hat{e})$ by substituting this result back into the expression for $R^{*}$:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{crit}} = R^{*}(\\hat{e}) = \\frac{m + D}{f(\\hat{e})} = \\frac{m + D}{y_{0}^{2} / (4a)}. $$\nSimplifying this expression gives the final result for the critical inflow concentration:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{4a(m + D)}{y_{0}^{2}}. $$\nThis is the minimum supply nutrient concentration required for the long-term persistence of the consumer population in the face of evolutionary adaptation.
