The task is to compute the Sörensen dissimilarity, report it as a simple fraction, and interpret the result in terms of turnover versus nestedness.\n\nValidation verdict:\nThe problem is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of community ecology, specifically the measurement of beta diversity. The terminology ($a$, $b$, $c$, Sörensen dissimilarity, turnover, nestedness) is standard. The provided data are complete, consistent, and plausible. The problem is well-posed, unambiguous, and admits a unique, meaningful solution. It requires the application of a standard ecological formula and a principled interpretation of its components, which is a legitimate scientific exercise.\n\nThe solution proceeds.\n\nThe problem requires a calculation of compositional dissimilarity between two species assemblages using the incidence-based Sörensen dissimilarity index, denoted here as $\\beta_{sor}$. The data are provided in the standard format for such calculations:\n- $a$: the number of species common to both assemblages (shared species), given as $a=15$.\n- $b$: the number of species present only in the first assemblage (lower band), given as $b=5$.\n- $c$: the number of species present only in the second assemblage (upper band), given as $c=10$.\n\nThe species richness of the lower band is $S_1 = a+b = 15+5 = 20$.\nThe species richness of the upper band is $S_2 = a+c = 15+10 = 25$.\nThe total species richness across both bands is $S_{total} = a+b+c = 15+5+10 = 30$.\n\nThe Sörensen dissimilarity index ($\\beta_{sor}$) is defined for presence–absence data as the ratio of the number of species unique to either assemblage to the sum of the species richnesses of both assemblages. The formula is:\n$$\n\\beta_{sor} = \\frac{b+c}{2a+b+c}\n$$\nThis can also be expressed in terms of the individual richness values as $\\beta_{sor} = \\frac{b+c}{(a+b)+(a+c)} = \\frac{b+c}{S_1+S_2}$.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$\na = 15, \\quad b = 5, \\quad c = 10\n$$\nWe compute the dissimilarity:\n$$\n\\beta_{sor} = \\frac{5+10}{2(15)+5+10} = \\frac{15}{30+15} = \\frac{15}{45}\n$$\nThis fraction must be simplified to its simplest terms. Both the numerator and denominator are divisible by $15$:\n$$\n\\beta_{sor} = \\frac{15 \\div 15}{45 \\div 15} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nSo, the compositional dissimilarity between the two elevational bands is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires an interpretation of this dissimilarity, specifically whether it is primarily driven by species turnover or by nestedness. This can be analyzed by partitioning the total dissimilarity. The total number of unshared species is $b+c = 5+10 = 15$. This total difference can be conceptually decomposed into two additive components:\n1.  A component due to balanced replacement or \"turnover\", which corresponds to the number of species in the poorer site that are replaced by an equal number of different species in the richer site. This is quantified by $2 \\times \\min(b,c)$.\n2.  A component due to richness differences, which leads to a \"nestedness\" pattern where one assemblage is a subset of the other. This is quantified by the absolute difference in the number of unique species, $|b-c|$.\n\nThe sum of these two components must equal the total number of unshared species: $2 \\times \\min(b,c) + |b-c| = b+c$.\nLet us verify this with the given data:\n- The turnover component is $2 \\times \\min(5, 10) = 2 \\times 5 = 10$.\n- The nestedness-related component is $|5 - 10| = |-5| = 5$.\n- The sum is $10 + 5 = 15$, which equals $b+c$.\n\nTo determine which process is the primary driver of the observed dissimilarity, we compare the magnitudes of these two components.\n- Contribution from turnover: $10$ species.\n- Contribution from nestedness/richness difference: $5$ species.\n\nSince the turnover component ($10$) is greater than the nestedness component ($5$), we conclude that the compositional dissimilarity between the lower and upper elevational bands is primarily driven by species turnover (replacement), rather than by a pattern of nested species loss. This indicates that as one moves from the lower to the upper band, many species are not just lost, but are replaced by a different set of species adapted to the higher elevation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}\n$$", "id": "2486627"}, {"introduction": "While ecological factors like temperature and productivity are often invoked to explain mid-elevation diversity peaks, it is crucial to first consider non-ecological null hypotheses.

Consider a species pool of $S$ species, where each species’ elevational range length $L$ is drawn independently from a continuous uniform distribution on $[200, 800]$ $\\mathrm{m}$. Conditional on its range length $L$, a species’ lower endpoint is placed independently and uniformly at random in $[0, D - L]$, so that its realized range occupies a contiguous interval of length $L$ fully contained within $[0, D]$.

The hard boundaries at $0$ and $D$ truncate permissible placements of species’ ranges. For a given $L$, let the lower endpoint be $a \\sim \\mathrm{Unif}[0, D - L]$. A point $x$ is covered if and only if $a \\in [x - L, x]$. Thus, the probability that a species with range length $L$ covers $x$ is the fraction of allowable $a$ that fall in the intersection $[x - L, x] \\cap [0, D - L]$, namely $p(x \\mid L) = \\dfrac{\\max\\{0,\\, \\min(x, D - L) - \\max(0, x - L)\\}}{D - L}$. For $x = D/2 = 1500$ and $L \\in [200, 800]$, we have $L \\leq 1500$ and $1500 \\leq D - L$; hence $p(1500 \\mid L) = \\dfrac{L}{D - L}$, which is the maximum attainable value of $p(x \\mid L)$ over $x \\in [0, D]$. For any $x \\neq 1500$, there is a nonzero measure of $L \\in [200, 800]$ for which $x  L$ or $D - x  L$, making $p(x \\mid L)  \\dfrac{L}{D - L}$. Therefore $E[R(x)] = S \\, E_{L}[p(x \\mid L)]$ is maximized at $x = 1500$.

The MDE is a well-established concept in macroecology and biogeography used to explain species richness gradients. The mathematical implementation via random placement of ranges within a bounded domain is a standard and scientifically valid approach.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is mathematically well-posed. The distributions for range size and placement are clearly defined. The quantity to be calculated, the expected species richness $R(x)$, is a well-defined mathematical expectation that can be derived from the given probability distributions. The question asks for the location of the maximum of this function, which is a standard problem in analysis.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, objective mathematical language.\n-   **Other Flaws:** The problem is self-contained, its parameters are consistent ($L_{\\max}  D$), and it is not trivial. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will now be derived from first principles.\n\n### Derivation of Expected Richness $R(x)$\nThe expected species richness $R(x)$ at an elevation $x$ is the total number of species $S$ multiplied by the probability $p(x)$ that a single randomly chosen species is present at that elevation.\n$$R(x) = S \\cdot p(x)$$\nThe probability $p(x)$ is obtained by averaging over all possible range lengths $L$ and placements $a$. By the law of total probability, we can first find the probability of a species covering $x$ conditional on its range length $L$, denoted $p(x \\mid L)$, and then average this over the distribution of $L$.\n$$p(x) = E_L[p(x \\mid L)] = \\int_{L_{\\min}}^{L_{\\max}} p(x \\mid L) f(L) \\, dL$$\nwhere $f(L)$ is the probability density function (PDF) of $L$. Since $L \\sim \\mathrm{Unif}[200, 800]$, its PDF is:\n$$f(L) = \\frac{1}{800 - 200} = \\frac{1}{600} \\quad \\text{for } L \\in [200, 800]$$\nFor a given range length $L$, a species covers elevation $x$ if its range $[a, a+L]$ contains $x$. This condition is equivalent to $a \\le x$ and $x \\le a+L$, which simplifies to $x-L \\le a \\le x$.\nThe lower endpoint $a$ is drawn uniformly from the interval $[0, D-L]$. The length of this interval of permissible placements is $D-L$.\nThe favorable placements for $a$ are those within the intersection of the two intervals: $[x-L, x] \\cap [0, D-L]$. The length of this intersection is given by $\\max\\{0, \\min(x, D-L) - \\max(0, x-L)\\}$.\nTherefore, the conditional probability is:\n$$p(x \\mid L) = \\frac{\\max\\{0, \\min(x, D-L) - \\max(0, x-L)\\}}{D-L}$$\nFor any $L$ in the given distribution, $L \\in [200, 800]$, we have $2L \\le 1600  3000 = D$. This simplifies the analysis of $p(x \\mid L)$, which takes the form of a symmetric trapezoid as a function of $x$:\n$$p(x \\mid L) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{x}{D-L}  \\text{if } 0 \\le x  L \\\\ \\frac{L}{D-L}  \\text{if } L \\le x \\le D-L \\\\ \\frac{D-x}{D-L}  \\text{if } D-L  x \\le D \\end{cases}$$\nThe maximum value of $p(x \\mid L)$ for a fixed $L$ is $\\frac{L}{D-L}$, and this maximum is achieved for all $x$ in the plateau interval $[L, D-L]$.\n\nTo find the elevation $x$ where the total expected richness $R(x)$ is maximized, we must find where the integral $p(x) = \\int_{200}^{800} p(x \\mid L) \\frac{1}{600} \\, dL$ is maximized. The integral is maximized if the integrand $p(x \\mid L)$ is maximized for every value of $L$ in the integration range. This occurs for any value of $x$ that lies within the plateau region $[L, D-L]$ for *all* $L \\in [200, 800]$. This corresponds to the intersection of all such plateau intervals:\n$$x \\in \\bigcap_{L \\in [200, 800]} [L, D-L]$$\nAs $L$ increases, the lower bound $L$ of the interval increases, and the upper bound $D-L$ decreases. The intersection is therefore determined by the extreme values of $L$:\n$$\\bigcap_{L \\in [200, 800]} [L, D-L] = [L_{\\max}, D-L_{\\max}] = [800, 3000-800] = [800, 2200]$$\nFor any elevation $x$ within the interval $[800, 2200]$, the condition $L \\le x \\le D-L$ holds for all $L \\in [200, 800]$. Thus, for any such $x$, $p(x \\mid L) = \\frac{L}{D-L}$ for all $L$. This means that $R(x)$ is constant and maximal for all $x \\in [800, 2200]\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\nFor any $x$ outside this central plateau (i.e., $x  800$ or $x  2200$), there exists a non-zero measure of $L$ values for which $p(x \\mid L)$ is strictly less than its maximum $\\frac{L}{D-L}$. Consequently, $R(x)$ is lower outside the plateau.\n\nThe question asks where $R(x)$ attains its maximum. It is attained over the entire interval $[800, 2200]]$. The mid-domain point $x=D/2 = 1500 \\ \\mathrm{m}$ is within this interval, and is therefore a point of maximum expected richness.\n\nLet us calculate the value of $R(1500)$:\n$$R(1500) = S \\cdot p(1500) = S \\int_{200}^{800} p(1500 \\mid L) \\frac{1}{600} \\, dL$$\nSince $1500 \\in [800, 2200]$, we use $p(1500 \\mid L) = \\frac{L}{3000-L}$.\n$$R(1500) = \\frac{S}{600} \\int_{200}^{800} \\frac{L}{3000-L} \\, dL$$\nTo solve the integral, we use algebraic manipulation:\n$$\\int \\frac{L}{3000-L} \\, dL = \\int \\frac{-(3000-L) + 3000}{3000-L} \\, dL = \\int \\left(-1 + \\frac{3000}{3000-L}\\right) \\, dL = -L - 3000 \\ln|3000-L|$$\nEvaluating the definite integral:\n$$\\begin{align*} \\int_{200}^{800} \\frac{L}{3000-L} \\, dL = \\left[-L - 3000 \\ln(3000-L)\\right]_{200}^{800} \\\\ = (-800 - 3000 \\ln(2200)) - (-200 - 3000 \\ln(2800)) \\\\ = -600 + 3000 (\\ln(2800) - \\ln(2200)) \\\\ = -600 + 3000 \\ln\\left(\\frac{2800}{2200}\\right) = -600 + 3000 \\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{11}\\right)\\end{align*}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $R(1500)$:\n$$R(1500) = \\frac{S}{600} \\left(-600 + 3000 \\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{11}\\right)\\right) = S \\left(-1 + 5 \\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{11}\\right)\\right)$$\nThis is the exact expression for the maximum expected richness. Numerically, $\\ln(14/11) \\approx 0.24116$, so $R(1500) \\approx S(5 \\times 0.24116 - 1) \\approx 0.2058 S$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A.** This option correctly states the mechanism of boundary truncation. It provides the correct formula for the conditional probability $p(x \\mid L)$. It correctly identifies that for $x = 1500 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $p(1500 \\mid L) = \\frac{L}{D-L}$, which is the maximum value of $p(x \\mid L)$. Its argument for why the peak is at $x=1500$ contains a flaw: \"For any $x \\neq 1500$, there is a nonzero measure of $L ...$ for which $p(x \\mid L)  \\frac{L}{D-L}$.\" As derived above, this is false for $x$ within the plateau $[800, 2200]$. However, the statement that $R(x)$ is maximized at $x=1500$ is true (as it is for any point on the plateau). It correctly claims that the phenomenon is consistent with a \"mid-domain peak\". Finally, it presents the exact expression for $R(1500)$ that we derived: $S \\left(5 \\ln \\frac{2800}{2200} - 1\\right)$. The numerical value provided $(\\approx 0.201 S)$ is a minor discrepancy from the more precise calculation $(\\approx 0.206 S)$, likely due to rounding or a typo, but the symbolic formula is correct. Despite the flaw in its uniqueness argument, its derivation is by far the most accurate and complete. **Correct.**\n\n**B.** This option claims the richness is flat, $E[R(x)] = S \\cdot E[L]/D$. This would be true for a different null model where ranges are placed and then truncated by boundaries, but it is fundamentally incorrect for the specified MDE model with \"hard boundaries\" (ranges fully contained within the domain). The hard boundaries explicitly create a non-uniform richness pattern. **Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This option presents a confused heuristic argument. It correctly calculates the average range length $E[L] = 500 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, but then incorrectly reasons about the distribution of range midpoints to predict a peak at $1000 \\ \\mathrm{m}$. Richness at a point is due to the overlap of ranges, not the density of midpoints. The argument is non-rigorous and its conclusion is wrong. The peak of midpoint density is actually at $D/2 = 1500 \\ \\mathrm{m}$. **Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** This option suggests a bimodal richness pattern with peaks near the edges of the domain, an effect opposite to the MDE. The MDE predicts minimum richness at the boundaries ($R(0)=R(D)=0$) and maximum richness in the center, because boundary constraints are strongest at the edges. This option describes a pattern inconsistent with the MDE mechanism. **Incorrect.**\n\n**E.** This option makes the claim that without environmental gradients, richness patterns cannot exist. This statement is a direct contradiction of the central premise of the mid-domain effect, which is precisely that geometric constraints alone are sufficient to generate a non-uniform, unimodal richness pattern. The entire problem is an exercise to demonstrate this principle. **Incorrect.**\n\n### Conclusion\nOption A provides the correct mathematical framework, correctly derives the expression for the expected richness at the mid-domain, and correctly identifies the mid-domain as a location of maximum richness. Its justification for the uniqueness of this peak is flawed, as a plateau of maximum richness exists. However, compared to the other options which are fundamentally wrong in their reasoning or conclusions, Option A is the most correct and complete description of the phenomenon.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2486575"}, {"introduction": "The link between climate and species distributions is central to understanding elevational gradients, particularly in an era of rapid climate change.

The problem statement is self-contained, with no contradictions or ambiguities. It requires the application of fundamental principles of multivariable calculus to a physical system. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe temperature field $T$ is a function of two independent variables: elevation $z$ and time $t$, so we write $T(z, t)$. An isotherm is a curve of constant temperature. Along the trajectory of an isotherm, denoted by the path $z(t)$, the temperature value does not change. This is expressed mathematically by the condition that the total derivative of temperature with respect to time along this path is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} T(z(t), t) = 0\n$$\nTo evaluate this total derivative, we must apply the chain rule for multivariable functions:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z} \\frac{dz}{dt} + \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{dz}{dt}$ represents the vertical velocity of the isotherm, which we denote as $v_z$. This is the upslope speed we are required to derive. Substituting this notation and the condition for an isotherm ($\\frac{dT}{dt} = 0$), we obtain the governing equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z} v_z + \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = 0\n$$\nThis equation establishes the relationship between the spatial gradient, the temporal trend, and the velocity of the isotherm. It is a direct consequence of the material invariance of temperature along the isotherm's path.\n\nWe can now solve for the upslope speed $v_z$ by rearranging the equation:\n$$\nv_z = - \\frac{\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}}{\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the speed of an isotherm under the given assumptions of a one-dimensional spatial domain. Note that this speed does not depend on the specific temperature of the isotherm (e.g., the $10^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ isotherm moves at the same speed as any other isotherm), because the problem states the gradients are uniform.\n\nNext, we substitute the provided values into this expression.

To do this, it is necessary to convert the units of our calculated speed into a form compatible with the time interval. We shall convert kilometers to meters and decades to years.

The total displacement $\\Delta z$ over a time interval $\\Delta t$ is therefore given by the simple kinematic relation:\n$$\n\\Delta z = v_z \\times \\Delta t\n$$\nSubstituting the values $\\Delta t = 80$ years and $v_z = 5 \\, \\text{m}\\,\\text{year}^{-1}$:\n$$\n\\Delta z = (5 \\, \\text{m}\\,\\text{year}^{-1}) \\times (80 \\, \\text{years}) = 400 \\, \\text{m}\n$$\nThus, the expected upslope displacement of the $10^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ isotherm (and any other isotherm) over an $80$-year period is $400$ meters.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{400}\n$$", "id": "2486578"}]}
