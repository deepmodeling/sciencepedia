It represents a classic application of graph theory to landscape ecology, specifically the calculation of a least-cost path on a resistance surface. The problem is valid and a unique solution for the minimum cost can be determined.\n\nThe problem is equivalent to finding the shortest path in a weighted, undirected graph. The nodes of the graph are the centers of the $25$ cells in the $5 \\times 5$ raster. An edge exists between any two nodes if their corresponding cells are $8$-neighbors (i.e., they share a side or a corner).\n\nThe cost, or weight, of traversing an edge between two cells, say cell $A$ at coordinates $(i_A, j_A)$ and cell $B$ at $(i_B, j_B)$, is defined by the isotropic cost-distance formula:\n$$w(A, B) = \\frac{\\mathbf{C}_{i_A, j_A} + \\mathbf{C}_{i_B, j_B}}{2} \\times d(A,B)$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{C}_{i,j}$ is the resistance cost of the cell at row $i$ and column $j$, and $d(A,B)$ is the Euclidean distance between the cell centers. Given a normalized cell size, the distance $d(A,B)$ is $1$ for orthogonal neighbors (sharing a side) and $\\sqrt{2}$ for diagonal neighbors (sharing a corner). Since all cell costs $\\mathbf{C}_{i,j}$ are positive, all edge weights $w(A,B)$ are positive.\n\nTo find the least-cost path from the start cell $(1,1)$ to the target cell $(5,5)$, we will use Dijkstra's algorithm. Let $D(i,j)$ denote the cumulative least-cost distance from the start cell $(1,1)$ to cell $(i,j)$.\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    The cost to the start cell is zero: $D(1,1) = 0$. The costs to all other cells are initialized to infinity: $D(i,j) = \\infty$ for $(i,j) \\neq (1,1)$. A priority queue, $Q$, is initialized with the start node: $Q = \\{(1,1)\\}$.\n\n2.  **Execution of Dijkstra's Algorithm**:\n    The algorithm iteratively selects the unvisited node with the smallest cumulative cost and updates the costs of its neighbors.\n\n    -   **Step 1**: Extract $(1,1)$ from $Q$. Its cost is $D(1,1)=0$. We update its neighbors:\n        -   Cell $(1,2)$ (orthogonal): $D(1,2) = D(1,1) + \\frac{\\mathbf{C}_{1,1} + \\mathbf{C}_{1,2}}{2} \\times 1 = 0 + \\frac{1+1}{2} \\times 1 = 1$.\n        -   Cell $(2,1)$ (orthogonal): $D(2,1) = D(1,1) + \\frac{\\mathbf{C}_{1,1} + \\mathbf{C}_{2,1}}{2} \\times 1 = 0 + \\frac{1+1}{2} \\times 1 = 1$.\n        -   Cell $(2,2)$ (diagonal): $D(2,2) = D(1,1) + \\frac{\\mathbf{C}_{1,1} + \\mathbf{C}_{2,2}}{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 0 + \\frac{1+1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$.\n        The nodes $(1,2)$, $(2,1)$, and $(2,2)$ are added to $Q$.\n\n    -   **Step 2**: The nodes $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$ have the lowest cost ($1$) in $Q$. We can expand from them. Expanding from these nodes reveals that any path to $(2,2)$ through them is more costly than the direct diagonal path. For instance, the path $(1,1) \\to (1,2) \\to (2,2)$ has a cost of $D(1,2) + \\frac{\\mathbf{C}_{1,2}+\\mathbf{C}_{2,2}}{2} \\times 1 = 1 + \\frac{1+1}{2} \\times 1 = 2$, which is greater than $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n    -   **Step 3**: The next node extracted from $Q$ is $(2,2)$ with cost $D(2,2) = \\sqrt{2}$. We examine its unvisited neighbors. The most promising path leads towards the diagonal, to cell $(3,3)$ which also has a low resistance cost of $\\mathbf{C}_{3,3}=1$.\n        -   Cost to $(3,3)$ (diagonal): $D(3,3) = D(2,2) + \\frac{\\mathbf{C}_{2,2} + \\mathbf{C}_{3,3}}{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1+1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n        Any path from $(2,2)$ to its other neighbors, such as $(2,3)$ or $(3,2)$ (which have cost $\\mathbf{C}=2$), will result in a higher per-step cost. For example, the cost to reach $(2,3)$ is $D(2,2) + \\frac{\\mathbf{C}_{2,2}+\\mathbf{C}_{2,3}}{2} \\times 1 = \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1+2}{2} = \\sqrt{2} + 1.5 \\approx 2.914$. The cost to $(3,3)$ is $2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 2.828$, which is lower.\n\n    -   **Step 4**: The algorithm continues, preferentially expanding along the path of least resistance. The costs for reaching subsequent cells along the main diagonal are:\n        -   From $(3,3)$ to $(4,4)$: The node $(3,3)$ is eventually extracted from $Q$ with cost $D(3,3)=2\\sqrt{2}$. The cost to its neighbor $(4,4)$ is updated:\n        $D(4,4) = D(3,3) + \\frac{\\mathbf{C}_{3,3} + \\mathbf{C}_{4,4}}{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1+1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n        -   From $(4,4)$ to $(5,5)$: The node $(4,4)$ is eventually extracted with cost $D(4,4)=3\\sqrt{2}$. The cost to the target cell $(5,5)$ is updated:\n        $D(5,5) = D(4,4) + \\frac{\\mathbf{C}_{4,4} + \\mathbf{C}_{5,5}}{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 3\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1+1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 4\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n3.  **Path Reconstruction and Final Cost**:\n    The algorithm will continue until $(5,5)$ is extracted from the priority queue as the node with the minimum cost among all unvisited nodes. A rigorous check confirms that no alternative path yields a lower cost than $4\\sqrt{2}$. For example, any deviation from this diagonal path of cost-$1$ cells necessitates traversing cells with higher resistance ($2$ or $8$) or taking more expensive orthogonal steps between cost-$1$ cells, both of which increase the total path cost.\n\n    The least-cost path is therefore the sequence of diagonal cells from the top-left to the bottom-right corner:\n    $$ (1,1) \\to (2,2) \\to (3,3) \\to (4,4) \\to (5,5) $$\n    The total cumulative cost is the sum of the four identical diagonal edge weights:\n    $$ \\text{Total Cost} = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{2} = 4\\sqrt{2} $$\n\n4.  **Numerical Answer**:\n    The problem requires the cumulative least-cost distance rounded to four significant figures.\n    $$ 4\\sqrt{2} \\approx 4 \\times 1.41421356 = 5.65685424 $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures gives $5.657$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.657}$$", "id": "2496843"}, {"introduction": "While individual paths are important, the persistence of a species often depends on population-level processes like colonization.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of metapopulation ecology, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the total instantaneous colonization rate, which we denote as $\\Lambda_i$, for each of the three habitat patches $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The core principles of the Levins-type metapopulation model, as described in the problem, will be used.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the dynamics. The colonization of a patch $i$ is contingent on two factors: the availability of empty habitat in patch $i$ and the influx of propagules from other occupied patches. The fraction of habitat in patch $i$ that is currently unoccupied and thus available for colonization is given by $(1 - p_i)$, where $p_i$ is the probability of occupancy.\n\nSecond, the rate of propagule supply to patch $i$ depends on the occupancy status of the source patches $j$ and the dispersal success between patches, quantified by the colonization coefficient $c_{ij}$. The propagule pressure from a single source patch $j$ to a target patch $i$ is proportional to the probability that patch $j$ is occupied, $p_j$, and the rate coefficient $c_{ij}$. The problem states that propagule inputs from different source patches are additive. Therefore, the total rate of propagule arrival per unit of empty habitat in patch $i$, which we can denote as the force of colonization $C_i$, is the sum of contributions from all other patches $j \\neq i$:\n$$\nC_i = \\sum_{j \\neq i} c_{ij} p_j\n$$\nThe total instantaneous colonization rate into patch $i$, $\\Lambda_i$, is the product of this force of colonization and the fraction of available habitat in patch $i$. This gives the fundamental equation for our calculation:\n$$\n\\Lambda_i = C_i (1 - p_i) = \\left( \\sum_{j \\neq i} c_{ij} p_j \\right) (1 - p_i)\n$$\nThe problem provides the necessary parameters to compute these rates.
