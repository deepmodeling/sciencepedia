This derivation will be based on an analysis of events over an infinitesimal time interval, leading to a differential equation for $p(\\tau)$. Second, leveraging the principle of independent lineages, we will extend this result to a starting population of $N_0$ individuals. Third, we will solve the resulting inequality for the minimal integer $N_0$ that satisfies the conservation manager's risk tolerance.\n\n**1. Derivation of Single-Ancestor Extinction Probability, $p(\\tau)$**\n\nLet $p(t) = \\mathbb{P}(N(t)=0 \\mid N(0)=1)$ be the probability that a population starting with a single individual goes extinct by time $t$. We derive a differential equation for $p(t)$ using the law of total probability, conditioning on the first event in an infinitesimal time interval $[0, dt)$. The process starting with one individual at time $t=0$ can evolve in one of three mutually exclusive ways as $dt \\to 0$:\n\n1.  A death occurs with probability $d \\cdot dt + o(dt)$. The population becomes $0$. Since $0$ is an absorbing state, extinction is assured. The probability of the lineage being extinct by time $t$ is $1$.\n2.  A birth occurs with probability $b \\cdot dt + o(dt)$. The population becomes $2$. By the Markov property and the independence of offspring, the original lineage goes extinct by time $t$ if and only if the two new, independent lineages both go extinct in the remaining time, $t-dt$. The probability of this is $[p(t-dt)]^2$.\n3.  Neither a birth nor a death occurs, with probability $1 - (b+d)dt + o(dt)$. The population remains $1$. The lineage goes extinct by time $t$ if the process, starting from this point, goes extinct in the remaining time $t-dt$. The probability is $p(t-dt)$.\n\nSumming these contributions, we have:\n$$\np(t) = d \\cdot dt \\cdot 1 + b \\cdot dt \\cdot [p(t-dt)]^2 + [1 - (b+d)dt] \\cdot p(t-dt) + o(dt)\n$$\nWe use the Taylor expansion $p(t-dt) = p(t) - \\frac{dp}{dt}dt + O(dt^2)$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$\np(t) = d \\cdot dt + b \\cdot dt \\cdot [p(t)]^2 + \\left( p(t) - \\frac{dp}{dt}dt \\right) - (b+d)dt \\cdot p(t) + O(dt^2)\n$$\nSimplifying and collecting terms of order $dt$:\n$$\n0 = d \\cdot dt + b \\cdot [p(t)]^2 \\cdot dt - \\frac{dp}{dt}dt - (b+d)p(t) \\cdot dt + O(dt^2)\n$$\nDividing by $dt$ and taking the limit as $dt \\to 0$, we obtain the backward Kolmogorov differential equation for $p(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = b p(t)^2 - (b+d)p(t) + d\n$$\nThe right-hand side is a quadratic in $p(t)$ which can be factored:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = (bp(t) - d)(p(t) - 1)\n$$\nThe initial condition is that at time $t=0$, the population is $N(0)=1$, so it cannot be extinct.

Extension to $N_0$ Individuals**\n\nA foundational principle of branching processes is the independence of lineages. A population starting with $N_0$ individuals goes extinct by time $\\tau$ if and only if all $N_0$ independent lineages, each initiated by one of the original individuals, go extinct by time $\\tau$. Therefore, the probability of extinction for the entire population is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(N(\\tau)=0 \\mid N(0)=N_0) = \\left[p(\\tau)\\right]^{N_0}\n$$\nThe manager's criterion is to find the smallest integer $N_0$ such that:\n$$\n[p(\\tau)]^{N_0} \\le \\alpha\n$$\n\n**3. Computation of the Minimum Viable Population $N_0$**\n\nTo find the minimal integer $N_0$, we analyze the inequality.\nIf $\\tau=0$, then $p(0)=0$. The inequality becomes $0^{N_0} \\le \\alpha$, which is true for any $N_0 \\ge 1$ since $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$. The smallest such integer is $N_0=1$.\n\nIf $\\tau0$, then $p(\\tau) \\in (0,1)$. We can take the natural logarithm of both sides. Since $\\ln(p(\\tau))$ is negative, the inequality sign is reversed upon division:\n$$\nN_0 \\ln(p(\\tau)) \\le \\ln(\\alpha) \\implies N_0 \\ge \\frac{\\ln(\\alpha)}{\\ln(p(\\tau))}\n$$\nThe smallest integer $N_0$ satisfying this condition is found using the ceiling function:\n$$\nN_0 = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\ln(\\alpha)}{\\ln(p(\\tau))} \\right\\rceil\n$$\nFor numerical implementation, particularly when $b$ is close to $d$, the formula for $p(\\tau)$ in the $b \\neq d$ case can be susceptible to floating-point error. It is better to use the mathematically equivalent and numerically more stable form involving `expm1(x) = e^x - 1`: let $x=(b-d)\\tau$, then\n$$\np(\\tau) = \\frac{d \\cdot \\text{expm1}(x)}{b \\cdot \\text{expm1}(x) + (b - d)}\n$$\nThis avoids the catastrophic cancellation that can occur when calculating $e^x-1$ for small $x$.\n\nThe final algorithm is as follows:\n1.  For each parameter set $(b,d,\\tau,\\alpha)$, first check if $\\tau=0$. If so, $N_0=1$.\n2.  Otherwise, calculate $p(\\tau)$ using the appropriate formula for the critical ($b=d$) or non-critical ($b \\neq d$) case, employing the numerically robust expression.\n3.  Compute the minimum required $N_0$ using the ceiling formula $N_0 = \\lceil \\ln(\\alpha) / \\ln(p(\\tau)) \\rceil$.

In a logistic model where environmental noise weakens at higher $N$ and demographic stochasticity dominates at low $N$ (so that the coefficient of variation decreases with $N$), the MVP necessarily scales linearly with $K$, because stronger density dependence at larger $K$ imposes a proportional buffer against quasi-extinction.\n\nE. For deterministic logistic growth with $r  0$ and no Allee effect, the deterministic MVP to avoid ever dropping below $N_q$ is $N_q$, whereas under environmental stochasticity with $r - \\sigma_e^2/2  0$, an approximation for the MVP that keeps the probability of ever hitting $N_q$ below a risk level $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ is $N_q \\cdot \\left(1/\\alpha\\right)^{\\sigma_e^2/\\left(2\\left(r - \\sigma_e^2/2\\right)\\right)}$, in which $K$ does not appear.", "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Deterministic model: $\\frac{dN}{dt} = r N \\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right)$, with $r$ as intrinsic growth rate and $K$ as carrying capacity.\n- Quasi-extinction threshold: A level $N_q$ such that $0  N_q  K$.\n- Minimum Viable Population (MVP): The minimal initial size $N_0$ for which the population remains above $N_q$ with a specified probability over a specified horizon.\n- Stochastic model (low density): $dN_t = r N_t \\, dt + \\sigma_e N_t \\, dW_t$, with $\\sigma_e  0$ as environmental noise intensity and $W_t$ as standard Brownian motion.\n- Allee effect: An unstable equilibrium $A$ with $0  A  K$.\n- Fact (i): The deterministic logistic model is monotone increasing for $N_0  0$ (and $N_0  K$).\n- Fact (ii): The process $X_t = \\ln N_t$ corresponding to the stochastic model evolves as $d(\\ln N_t) = \\left(r - \\frac{\\sigma_e^2}{2}\\right) dt + \\sigma_e dW_t$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is well-defined and scientifically grounded. It presents standard models from theoretical ecology: the logistic equation for deterministic density-dependent growth, and geometric Brownian motion as a common approximation for stochastic population dynamics at low densities. The definitions for MVP and quasi-extinction are standard. The inclusion of the Allee effect is also a standard topic in population viability analysis. The mathematical fact provided (Itô's lemma applied to $\\ln N_t$) is correct. The problem does not violate any principles of scientific soundness, is well-posed, objective, and self-contained.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Analysis of Options**\n\nWe shall now evaluate each statement based on the provided framework.\n\n**Option A Analysis**\nThe statement claims that in a deterministic logistic model, the MVP is $K$. The MVP is defined as the *minimal* initial size $N_0$ such that the population size $N(t)$ remains above $N_q$ for all future times. The governing equation is $\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right)$ with $r  0$.\nIf the initial population $N_0$ is in the interval $0  N_0  K$, the derivative $\\frac{dN}{dt}$ is positive, meaning the population will monotonically increase toward $K$. The minimum value of the population for all time $t \\ge 0$ is its initial value, $N_0$. Therefore, to ensure that $N(t)  N_q$ for all $t \\ge 0$, we must have the initial condition $N_0  N_q$. The minimal such value is $N_q$ itself (or infinitesimally greater in a continuous model).\nIf $N_0 \\ge K$, the population decreases towards $K$ (or stays at $K$), so it always remains above $N_q$ since $K  N_q$.\nThe minimal starting population that guarantees staying above $N_q$ is therefore $N_q$. The statement that the MVP is $K$ is false; $K$ is a sufficient starting size, but not the minimal one. The reasoning given is also incorrect; stability of an equilibrium is not the direct determinant of the MVP in this context.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option B Analysis**\nThe statement concerns the stochastic model $dN_t = r N_t \\, dt + \\sigma_e N_t \\, dW_t$ under the condition $r - \\frac{\\sigma_e^2}{2} \\le 0$. The logarithm of the population, $X_t = \\ln N_t$, follows an arithmetic Brownian motion with drift $\\mu = r - \\frac{\\sigma_e^2}{2}$ and volatility $\\sigma_e$.\nThe problem considers an unbounded time horizon and asks about the probability of eventually hitting the quasi-extinction threshold $N_q$. This corresponds to the process $X_t$ hitting the level $\\ln N_q$ starting from $X_0 = \\ln N_0  \\ln N_q$.\nFor an arithmetic Brownian motion $X_t$ with drift $\\mu$ starting at $X_0$, the probability of ever hitting a lower boundary $b  X_0$ is $1$ if the drift $\\mu \\le 0$, and $e^{-2\\mu(X_0 - b)/\\sigma_e^2}$ if $\\mu  0$.\nThe condition given is $\\mu = r - \\frac{\\sigma_e^2}{2} \\le 0$. Under this condition, the probability of the process $X_t = \\ln N_t$ eventually hitting any lower level, including $\\ln N_q$, is exactly $1$, regardless of the starting point $N_0$ (as long as it is finite). This means the probability of eventual quasi-extinction is $1$, and the probability of persistence is $0$.\nTherefore, it is impossible to find a finite initial size $N_0$ that can achieve any specified high persistence probability (e.g., $0.95$). The MVP, as defined, would be infinite. In this regime, the population is bound for extinction, and the carrying capacity $K$ (which is part of the high-density dynamics not even present in this model approximation) is completely irrelevant to the long-term outcome and thus irrelevant as a proxy for a meaningful MVP.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option C Analysis**\nThis option introduces a strong Allee effect, characterized by an unstable equilibrium $A$ ($0  A  K$). In the deterministic model, populations with $N_0  A$ decline to extinction, while populations with $N_0  A$ grow towards $K$. The threshold $A$ is a critical tipping point.\nWhen stochasticity is introduced, a population that starts just above $A$ is at high risk of being pushed below $A$ by random fluctuations, which would then likely lead to extinction. To achieve a high probability of persistence, the initial population $N_0$ must be sufficiently large to provide a buffer against falling below $A$. The MVP is therefore determined by the location of the Allee threshold $A$ and the magnitude of population fluctuations (the \"variance structure\") around $A$.\nThe carrying capacity $K$ describes the upper limit of population growth, a phenomenon that occurs at high densities, far from the critical region around $A$. The value of $K$ has little to no influence on whether a small population overcomes the Allee threshold. For instance, whether $K$ is $1,000$ or $100,000$ does not change the fact that the population must first survive the peril at low densities dictated by $A$. Therefore, $K$ is a poor and potentially misleading proxy for MVP in the presence of a strong Allee effect.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option D Analysis**\nThis statement proposes that MVP \"necessarily scales linearly with $K$\". It provides a justification: \"because stronger density dependence at larger $K$ imposes a proportional buffer\". This justification is fundamentally flawed. In the logistic model, the per capita growth rate is $g(N) = r(1 - N/K)$. The strength of density dependence can be measured by the derivative $|\\frac{dg}{dN}| = \\frac{r}{K}$. This shows that a larger $K$ leads to *weaker*, not stronger, density dependence. So the premise of the reasoning is incorrect.\nFurthermore, as established in other options, the MVP is primarily a function of dynamics at low population sizes, near the quasi-extinction threshold $N_q$. The carrying capacity $K$ is a parameter governing high-density dynamics. For large $K$, the term $(1 - N/K) \\approx 1$ for small $N$, so the influence of $K$ on low-density growth is negligible. There is no fundamental principle to suggest a necessary linear scaling between MVP and $K$. In fact, models that ignore density dependence (valid for large $K$) show that MVP can be entirely independent of $K$ (see Option E). The statement is therefore built on incorrect premises and draws an unsubstantiated conclusion.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option E Analysis**\nThis statement consists of two parts.\nFirst, for deterministic logistic growth, the MVP to avoid ever dropping below $N_q$ is $N_q$. As established in the analysis of Option A, if $N_0  N_q$, the population will grow away from $N_q$. The infimum of initial values that satisfy the condition is $N_q$. This part is correct.\nSecond, it provides a formula for the stochastic MVP. We need to find the minimal $N_0$ such that the probability of ever hitting $N_q$ is less than a risk level $\\alpha$. The process is again $X_t = \\ln N_t$ with drift $\\mu = r - \\frac{\\sigma_e^2}{2}  0$. The probability of hitting the lower boundary $b = \\ln N_q$ from $X_0 = \\ln N_0$ is $P_{ext} = e^{-2\\mu(\\ln N_0 - \\ln N_q)/\\sigma_e^2}$.\nWe require $P_{ext}  \\alpha$:\n$$ e^{-2\\mu\\ln(N_0/N_q)/\\sigma_e^2}  \\alpha $$\nTaking logarithms and rearranging:\n$$ -\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma_e^2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{N_0}{N_q}\\right)  \\ln(\\alpha) $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_0}{N_q}\\right)  -\\frac{\\sigma_e^2}{2\\mu}\\ln(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\sigma_e^2}{2\\mu}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{N_0}{N_q}  \\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right)^{\\frac{\\sigma_e^2}{2\\mu}} $$\nThe MVP is the minimal $N_0$ satisfying this, which is the right-hand side of the inequality. Substituting $\\mu = r - \\frac{\\sigma_e^2}{2}$:\n$$ \\text{MVP} = N_q \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right)^{\\frac{\\sigma_e^2}{2\\left(r - \\sigma_e^2/2\\right)}} $$\nThis matches the formula in the option. This result is derived from the low-density model where density dependence is ignored, which is why the parameter $K$ does not appear. This part of the statement is also correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCE}$$", "id": "2509912"}]}
