The three processes are, in order, $P_{1}$ (electricity supply), $P_{2}$ (nitrogen fertilizer production), and $P_{3}$ (crop cultivation).

All required data and functional relationships are provided, are scientifically sound, and are mathematically consistent. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle of this model is the conservation of flows. The total output of all processes, represented by the activity vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$, must balance the sum of the intermediate demand required to sustain production, which is given by the matrix product $A x$, and the final demand from outside the system, given by the vector $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$. This balance is expressed by the linear equation:\n$$\nx \\;=\\; A x + y\n$$\nTo determine the necessary activity levels $x$ to satisfy a final demand $y$, we must solve this system of linear equations for $x$. We rearrange the equation as follows:\n$$\nx - A x \\;=\\; y\n$$\n$$\n(I - A) x \\;=\\; y\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix. The vector $x$ can be found by pre-multiplying both sides by the inverse of the matrix $(I - A)$, provided this inverse exists.

For this upper triangular matrix, the determinant is the product of the diagonal elements:\n$$\n\\det(I - A) \\;=\\; 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\;=\\; 1\n$$\nSince $\\det(I - A) \\neq 0$, the matrix is invertible.

We are required to compute the climate change impact per FU under three different co-product handling methods.\n\n1.  **Mass Allocation**\n    In attributional LCA, allocation partitions the total environmental burden, $E_{total}$, among the co-products based on a physical property. For mass allocation, the partitioning is based on the mass of the products.\n    The total mass of co-products is $M_{total} = M_{milk} + M_{beef}$.\n    The allocation factor for milk, $AF_{milk, mass}$, is the ratio of the mass of milk to the total mass of co-products:\n    $$AF_{milk, mass} = \\frac{M_{milk}}{M_{milk} + M_{beef}}$$\n    The total emissions allocated to the entire milk output is $E_{milk, mass} = E_{total} \\times AF_{milk, mass}$.\n    The climate change intensity per FU, $I_{milk, mass}$, is the total allocated emissions divided by the total mass of milk produced:\n    $$I_{milk, mass} = \\frac{E_{milk, mass}}{M_{milk}} = \\frac{E_{total} \\times \\frac{M_{milk}}{M_{milk} + M_{beef}}}{M_{milk}} = \\frac{E_{total}}{M_{milk} + M_{beef}}$$\n    Substituting the given numerical values:\n    $$I_{milk, mass} = \\frac{7.2 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\text{kg} \\, \\text{CO}_2\\text{e}}{5.4 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ kg} + 1.77 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ kg}} = \\frac{7.2 \\times 10^{6}}{5.577 \\times 10^{6}} \\frac{\\text{kg} \\, \\text{CO}_2\\text{e}}{\\text{kg}} \\approx 1.29101667 \\frac{\\text{kg} \\, \\text{CO}_2\\text{e}}{\\text{kg milk}}$$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, the result is $1.291$ kg CO$_2$e/kg milk.\n\n2.  **Economic Allocation**\n    For economic allocation, the partitioning is based on the relative market value of the co-products.\n    The total economic value (revenue) is $V_{total} = (M_{milk} \\times P_{milk}) + (M_{beef} \\times P_{beef})$.\n    The allocation factor for milk, $AF_{milk, econ}$, is the ratio of the revenue from milk to the total revenue:\n    $$AF_{milk, econ} = \\frac{M_{milk} \\times P_{milk}}{(M_{milk} \\times P_{milk}) + (M_{beef} \\times P_{beef})}$$\n    The total emissions allocated to the milk output is $E_{milk, econ} = E_{total} \\times AF_{milk, econ}$.\n    The climate change intensity per FU, $I_{milk, econ}$, is:\n    $$I_{milk, econ} = \\frac{E_{milk, econ}}{M_{milk}} = \\frac{E_{total}}{M_{milk}} \\times \\frac{M_{milk} \\times P_{milk}}{(M_{milk} \\times P_{milk}) + (M_{beef} \\times P_{beef})}$$\n    First, we calculate the economic values:\n    - Revenue from milk: $V_{milk} = (5.4 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ kg}) \\times (\\$0.45/\\text{kg}) = \\$2.43 \\times 10^{6}$.\n    - Revenue from beef: $V_{beef} = (1.77 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ kg}) \\times (\\$2.20/\\text{kg}) = \\$3.894 \\times 10^{5}$.\n    - Total revenue: $V_{total} = \\$2.43 \\times 10^{6} + \\$3.894 \\times 10^{5} = \\$2.8194 \\times 10^{6}$.\n    Now, substitute these into the expression for $I_{milk, econ}$:\n    $$I_{milk, econ} = \\frac{7.2 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\text{kg} \\, \\text{CO}_2\\text{e}}{5.4 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ kg}} \\times \\frac{\\$2.43 \\times 10^{6}}{\\$2.8194 \\times 10^{6}} \\approx 1.3333... \\times 0.861878... \\frac{\\text{kg} \\, \\text{CO}_2\\text{e}}{\\text{kg milk}} \\approx 1.1491712 \\frac{\\text{kg} \\, \\text{CO}_2\\text{e}}{\\text{kg milk}}$$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, the result is $1.149$ kg CO$_2$e/kg milk.\n\n3.  **System Expansion with Substitution**\n    This consequential LCA approach avoids allocation by expanding the system boundary. The burden of the multifunctional system is credited with the impacts that are avoided by providing the co-product, which displaces an alternative, single-function process.\n    The production of $M_{beef}$ from the dairy system displaces dedicated beef production. The avoided emissions, $E_{avoided}$, are calculated as:\n    $$E_{avoided} = M_{beef} \\times I_{disp\\_beef}$$\n    The net emissions of the expanded system, which now exclusively produces milk as its function, are the total emissions minus the avoided emissions:\n    $$E_{net} = E_{total} - E_{avoided} = E_{total} - (M_{beef} \\times I_{disp\\_beef})$$\n    The climate change intensity of milk under this method, $I_{milk, sys\\_exp}$, is the net emissions divided by the total mass of milk:\n    $$I_{milk, sys\\_exp} = \\frac{E_{net}}{M_{milk}} = \\frac{E_{total} - (M_{beef} \\times I_{disp\\_beef})}{M_{milk}}$$\n    Substituting the given numerical values:\n    $$E_{avoided} = (1.77 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ kg}) \\times (18 \\frac{\\text{kg} \\, \\text{CO}_2\\text{e}}{\\text{kg}}) = 3.186 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\text{kg} \\, \\text{CO}_2\\text{e}$$\n    $$E_{net} = 7.2 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\text{kg} \\, \\text{CO}_2\\text{e} - 3.186 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\text{kg} \\, \\text{CO}_2\\text{e} = 4.014 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\text{kg} \\, \\text{CO}_2\\text{e}$$\n    $$I_{milk, sys\\_exp} = \\frac{4.014 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\text{kg} \\, \\text{CO}_2\\text{e}}{5.4 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ kg}} = 0.74333... \\frac{\\text{kg} \\, \\text{CO}_2\\text{e}}{\\text{kg milk}}$$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, the result is $0.7433$ kg CO$_2$e/kg milk.\n\nThe three calculated values for the climate change intensity of $1$ kg of milk are: $1.291$ (mass allocation), $1.149$ (economic allocation), and $0.7433$ (system expansion).
