First, a validation of the problem statement is required.\n\nStep 1: Extract Givens.\nThe problem provides the following:\n- A site is visited $K$ times, where $K$ is a positive integer.\n- The detection history is a vector $y=(y_1,\\dots,y_K)$, where $y_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is the binary detection indicator for visit $i$.\n- A latent occupancy state $Z \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is constant for the season, where $Z=1$ means occupied and $Z=0$ means unoccupied.\n- The probability of occupancy is $P(Z=1) = \\psi$.\n- The probability of non-occupancy is $P(Z=0) = 1-\\psi$.\n- The per-visit detection probability, given the site is occupied, is $P(y_i=1 | Z=1) = p$, where $p \\in (0,1)$. This implies the probability of non-detection on a visit, given occupancy, is $P(y_i=0 | Z=1) = 1-p$.\n- There are no false positives, meaning $P(y_i=1 | Z=0) = 0$. This implies $P(y_i=0 | Z=0) = 1$.\n- Detections on different visits are conditionally independent given the latent state $Z$.\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens.\nThe problem is assessed against the required criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes the standard single-season occupancy model (MacKenzie et al., 2002), which is a fundamental and widely accepted framework in ecology and conservation biology for analyzing detection/non-detection data. All assumptions are standard for this model.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined. It requests the derivation of a likelihood function based on a complete and consistent set of probabilistic definitions and assumptions. A unique, meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and devoid of any subjective or non-scientific content.\n\nThe problem statement does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, complete, and formalizable.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to derive the likelihood function $L(\\psi, p | y)$, which is equivalent to the probability of observing the specific detection history $y=(y_1, \\dots, y_K)$ given the parameters $\\psi$ and $p$. We denote this as $P(y | \\psi, p)$.\n\nThe observation of vector $y$ is conditional on the unobserved (latent) state of occupancy, $Z$. We must therefore use the law of total probability to express $P(y)$ by marginalizing over the two possible states of $Z$:\n$$P(y) = P(y | Z=1) P(Z=1) + P(y | Z=0) P(Z=0)$$\n\nWe are given $P(Z=1)=\\psi$ and $P(Z=0)=1-\\psi$. We must now derive the conditional probabilities $P(y|Z=1)$ and $P(y|Z=0)$.\n\nFirst, consider the case where the site is occupied ($Z=1$). The problem states that individual detections $y_i$ are conditionally independent given $Z$. Therefore, the probability of the entire history $y$ given $Z=1$ is the product of the probabilities of the individual observations:\n$$P(y | Z=1) = P(y_1, \\dots, y_K | Z=1) = \\prod_{i=1}^{K} P(y_i | Z=1)$$\nFor each visit $i$, the outcome $y_i$ given $Z=1$ follows a Bernoulli trial with success probability $p$. The probability mass function for a single observation $y_i$ can be written concisely as $p^{y_i} (1-p)^{1-y_i}$. If $y_i=1$, this gives $p^1(1-p)^0=p$. If $y_i=0$, this gives $p^0(1-p)^1=1-p$. Substituting this into the product gives the expression for the joint probability:\n$$P(y | Z=1) = \\prod_{i=1}^{K} p^{y_i} (1-p)^{1-y_i}$$\n\nSecond, consider the case where the site is unoccupied ($Z=0$). Again, using conditional independence:\n$$P(y | Z=0) = P(y_1, \\dots, y_K | Z=0) = \\prod_{i=1}^{K} P(y_i | Z=0)$$\nThe assumption of no false positives states that $P(y_i=1|Z=0)=0$ and consequently $P(y_i=0|Z=0)=1$. We can write a general expression for $P(y_i|Z=0)$ using the value of $y_i$. Note that if $y_i=1$, the probability is $0$. If $y_i=0$, the probability is $1$. This corresponds exactly to the expression $(1-y_i)$. Thus, $P(y_i|Z=0) = (1-y_i)$.\nSubstituting this into the product:\n$$P(y | Z=0) = \\prod_{i=1}^{K} (1-y_i)$$\nThis product has the property that if any $y_i=1$, one term in the product will be $(1-1)=0$, making the entire product zero. This correctly reflects that it is impossible to observe a detection if the site is unoccupied. If all $y_i=0$, then every term is $(1-0)=1$, and the product is $1$.\n\nFinally, we substitute these two conditional probabilities back into the law of total probability:\n$$P(y | \\psi, p) = \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{K} p^{y_i} (1-p)^{1-y_i} \\right) P(Z=1) + \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{K} (1-y_i) \\right) P(Z=0)$$\nReplacing $P(Z=1)$ with $\\psi$ and $P(Z=0)$ with $(1-\\psi)$ yields the final likelihood expression:\n$$L(\\psi, p | y_1, \\dots, y_K) = \\psi \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{K} p^{y_i} (1-p)^{1-y_i} \\right) + (1-\\psi) \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{K} (1-y_i) \\right)$$\nThis is the required closed-form function. It is a single analytic expression that correctly handles both cases:\n1. If at least one detection occurs (some $y_j=1$), the term $\\prod_{i=1}^{K} (1-y_i)$ becomes $0$, and the likelihood simplifies to $L = \\psi \\prod_{i=1}^{K} p^{y_i} (1-p)^{1-y_i}$, indicating the site must be occupied.\n2. If no detections occur (all $y_i=0$), then $\\prod_{i=1}^{K} (1-y_i) = 1$ and $\\prod_{i=1}^{K} p^{y_i} (1-p)^{1-y_i} = \\prod_{i=1}^{K} (1-p) = (1-p)^K$. The likelihood becomes $L = \\psi (1-p)^K + (1-\\psi)$, representing the sum of probabilities of two scenarios: the site being occupied but the species was missed, and the site being truly unoccupied.\nThis completes the derivation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\psi \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{K} p^{y_i} (1-p)^{1-y_i} \\right) + (1-\\psi) \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{K} (1-y_i) \\right)}\n$$", "id": "2476164"}, {"introduction": "While standard occupancy models account for imperfect detection (a type of false negative), data from a diverse pool of citizen scientists often introduces another layer of complexity: species misidentification.

The event $Y_i=1$ is defined as $\\max_{1 \\leq j \\leq K} R_{ij} = 1$, which is equivalent to at least one $R_{ij}$ being equal to $1$. It is more direct to compute the probability of the complement event, $Y_i=0$, which corresponds to $\\max_{1 \\leq j \\leq K} R_{ij} = 0$, or $R_{ij}=0$ for all $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, K\\}$.\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(Y_i=1 \\mid Z_i=1) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(Y_i=0 \\mid Z_i=1) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(R_{i1}=0, R_{i2}=0, \\dots, R_{iK}=0 \\mid Z_i=1) $$\nThe reports $R_{ij}$ are conditionally independent across visits $j$ given the true state $Z_i$. Therefore:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(R_{i1}=0, \\dots, R_{iK}=0 \\mid Z_i=1) = \\prod_{j=1}^{K} \\mathbb{P}(R_{ij}=0 \\mid Z_i=1) $$\nThe probability $\\mathbb{P}(R_{ij}=0 \\mid Z_i=1)$ is the false-negative rate, given as $\\beta$. This rate is constant for all visits. So, the product becomes $\\beta^K$.\nThus, the probability of detecting an occupied site is:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(Y_i=1 \\mid Z_i=1) = 1 - \\beta^K $$\nThe term $\\mathbb{P}(Y_i=1 \\mid Z_i=0)$ is the probability of observing at least one detection at a site that is truly unoccupied. This corresponds to a site-level false positive. We again compute this via the complement:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(Y_i=1 \\mid Z_i=0) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(Y_i=0 \\mid Z_i=0) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(R_{i1}=0, \\dots, R_{iK}=0 \\mid Z_i=0) $$\nUsing conditional independence:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(R_{i1}=0, \\dots, R_{iK}=0 \\mid Z_i=0) = \\prod_{j=1}^{K} \\mathbb{P}(R_{ij}=0 \\mid Z_i=0) $$\nThe probability of a false-positive report is $\\mathbb{P}(R_{ij}=1 \\mid Z_i=0) = \\alpha$. The probability of correctly reporting an absence at an unoccupied site is the complement, $\\mathbb{P}(R_{ij}=0 \\mid Z_i=0) = 1 - \\alpha$.

The number of vocalizations, or calls, is modeled as a Homogeneous Poisson Process with a rate of $\\lambda$ calls per minute. The duration of the recording for a single visit is a random variable $E$, measured in minutes. A detection occurs if one or more calls are registered during this recording period.\n\nFor a fixed recording duration $E=e$, the number of calls $N(e)$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda e$.
