By working through this problem, you will not only practice the essential math but also connect the quantitative result to its profound ecological meaning for coexistence theory. [@problem_id:2522444]", "problem": "Two plant species, denoted $A$ and $B$, were assayed in a reciprocal soil-conditioning experiment to quantify plant–soil feedback (PSF). Each species was first grown to condition a live microbial community in sterilized field soil. Then, in a subsequent assay phase, seedlings of each species were transplanted into soils conditioned by either conspecifics or heterospecifics. For each combination, the response variable is a dimensionless per-capita performance factor $P_{ij} > 0$ (mean relative biomass per plant over the assay interval, normalized to a sterilized uninoculated control), where $i \\in \\{A,B\\}$ indexes the focal species and $j \\in \\{A,B\\}$ indexes the conditioner species.

The validation of the problem statement is the mandatory first step.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the established ecological theory of plant-soil feedbacks, specifically referencing the Bever model framework. It provides a clear, objective task with all necessary data. The given performance factors, $P_{ij}$, are dimensionless and positive, which is consistent with their definition as normalized relative biomass. The logarithmic transformation $\\alpha_{ij} = \\ln P_{ij}$ is a standard method to convert multiplicative effects into an additive scale for linear modeling. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and free of scientific or logical contradictions. It is therefore deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed to the solution. The problem defines the PSF coefficient as an aggregation, across species, of the \"conspecific-versus-heterospecific difference in the soil-biota-mediated per-capita effect.\" Let us formalize this definition.\n\nThe per-capita effect of the soil biota on a plant of species $i$ grown in soil conditioned by species $j$ is given by $\\alpha_{ij} = \\ln P_{ij}$.\n\nFor the focal species $A$ (where $i=A$), the per-capita effect from its own (conspecific) soil is $\\alpha_{AA}$. The per-capita effect from the other (heterospecific) species' soil is $\\alpha_{AB}$. The \"conspecific-versus-heterospecific difference\" for species $A$ is therefore the difference between these two effects:\n$$ \\Delta_A = \\alpha_{AA} - \\alpha_{AB} $$\n\nSimilarly, for the focal species $B$ (where $i=B$), the conspecific effect is $\\alpha_{BB}$ and the heterospecific effect is $\\alpha_{BA}$. The corresponding difference for species $B$ is:\n$$ \\Delta_B = \\alpha_{BB} - \\alpha_{BA} $$\n\nThe problem states that the overall feedback coefficient aggregates these differences across species. In the context of PSF interaction models, \"aggregation\" implies summation. Let us denote the two-species feedback coefficient as $\\Psi$.\n$$ \\Psi = \\Delta_A + \\Delta_B = (\\alpha_{AA} - \\alpha_{AB}) + (\\alpha_{BB} - \\alpha_{BA}) $$\nThis expression represents the total net feedback in the two-species community.\n\nTo express this coefficient purely in terms of the given performance factors $P_{ij}$, we substitute the definition $\\alpha_{ij} = \\ln P_{ij}$:\n$$ \\Psi = (\\ln P_{AA} - \\ln P_{AB}) + (\\ln P_{BB} - \\ln P_{BA}) $$\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, specifically $\\ln x - \\ln y = \\ln(x/y)$ and $\\ln x + \\ln y = \\ln(xy)$, we can simplify this expression:\n$$ \\Psi = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{AA}}{P_{AB}}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{BB}}{P_{BA}}\\right) $$\n$$ \\Psi = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{AA} P_{BB}}{P_{AB} P_{BA}}\\right) $$\nThis is the final expression for the feedback coefficient in terms of the $P_{ij}$ values. It is often referred to in literature as the net feedback index or interaction strength, $I_s$.\n\nNow, we compute its numerical value using the provided data:\n$P_{AA} = 0.82$\n$P_{AB} = 1.05$\n$P_{BA} = 0.96$\n$P_{BB} = 0.74$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ \\Psi = \\ln\\left(\\frac{(0.82) \\times (0.74)}{(1.05) \\times (0.96)}\\right) $$\n$$ \\Psi = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.6068}{1.008}\\right) $$\n$$ \\Psi = \\ln(0.60198412698...) $$\n$$ \\Psi \\approx -0.5075306... $$\n\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the numerical value of the feedback coefficient is $-0.5075$.\n\nFinally, we must interpret the sign of this result. The coefficient $\\Psi$ is negative. A negative value for $\\Psi$ implies that $\\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{AA} P_{BB}}{P_{AB} P_{BA}}\\right)  0$, which in turn means $\\frac{P_{AA} P_{BB}}{P_{AB} P_{BA}}  1$, or $P_{AA} P_{BB}  P_{AB} P_{BA}$. This inequality shows that the product of the performances of the two species in heterospecific soils is greater than the product of their performances in conspecific soils.\n\nLooking at the additive form, $\\Psi = (\\alpha_{AA} - \\alpha_{AB}) + (\\alpha_{BB} - \\alpha_{BA})  0$, we can see that, on average, each species performs more poorly in soil conditioned by its own species than in soil conditioned by the other species. This is the definition of negative plant-soil feedback. For species $A$, the feedback is $\\ln(P_{AA}/P_{AB}) = \\ln(0.82/1.05)  0$. For species $B$, the feedback is $\\ln(P_{BB}/P_{BA}) = \\ln(0.74/0.96)  0$. Both species suffer from negative conspecific feedback relative to heterospecific interactions.\n\nIn population dynamics, this creates negative frequency dependence. When a species becomes abundant, its own self-limiting soil environment (e.g., accumulation of host-specific pathogens) also becomes widespread. This puts the common species at a disadvantage relative to the rare species, which benefits from encountering more heterospecific soil. This mechanism gives the rare species a growth advantage, preventing it from being eliminated and thus stabilizing coexistence between the two species.\n\nConversely, a positive value ($\\Psi  0$) would indicate positive plant-soil feedback, where each species facilitates its own growth more than it facilitates the other's. This leads to positive frequency dependence and priority effects, where the species that starts with a higher abundance tends to competitively exclude the other, destabilizing coexistence.\n\nTherefore, the negative sign of the calculated coefficient indicates that the plant-soil feedback in this system tends to stabilize coexistence through negative frequency dependence.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-0.5075} $$", "id": "2522444"}, {"introduction": "The reliability of any calculated feedback index hinges on the integrity of the underlying experimental design. This next practice moves from calculation to design, challenging you to navigate the complexities of setting up a valid \"home-away\" experiment. The central challenge is to avoid the pervasive issue of pseudoreplication, ensuring that your experimental units are truly independent and that your conclusions about soil biota effects are statistically robust. [@problem_id:2522447]", "problem": "You are tasked with quantifying plant–soil feedback (PSF) in a greenhouse for a community of $s = 4$ perennial plant species using a two-phase design. In the conditioning phase, each species is grown in monoculture to condition soil biota. In the feedback phase, seedlings of each species are planted into pots containing a sterile background substrate amended with a small volume fraction of live inoculum derived from the conditioning phase. Your objectives are to implement a valid home–away scheme (where “home” means conspecific-conditioned inoculum and “away” means heterospecific-conditioned inoculum) and to avoid pseudoreplication of soil inocula. Pseudoreplication is defined as the use of non-independent subsamples as if they were independent replicates of the treatment. You have resources to grow $n \\ge 5$ independent conditioning pots per species and to assemble a balanced set of test pots. Select all protocols below that simultaneously (i) implement a valid home–away PSF comparison and (ii) avoid pseudoreplication of inocula.\n\nA. Two-phase design with independent donor identity retained. Conditioning phase: grow each species in $n$ independent monoculture pots on sterile substrate, then harvest and keep inoculum from each conditioning pot separate. Feedback phase: assemble test pots with sterile background substrate amended with exactly $10\\%$ (by volume) live inoculum. For each test species, create “home” pots by inoculating each test pot with the live inoculum from a single, unique conspecific conditioning pot (no pooling and no reuse of that inoculum across multiple test pots), and create “away” pots by inoculating each test pot with inoculum from a single, unique heterospecific conditioning pot, distributing away donors evenly across heterospecific species. Randomize positions and block as needed. Analyze with a model that treats donor identity as a random effect nested within donor species.\n\nB. Species-level composite inocula. Conditioning phase: grow $n$ conditioning pots per species, then pool all $n$ pots of a species into one composite inoculum per species. Feedback phase: for each test species, create “home” and “away” pots by inoculating $20$ pots per category from the relevant species-level composite. Treat the $20$ pots per category as $20$ replicates in analysis.\n\nC. Community-conditioned soils. Conditioning phase: grow mixed-species stands where all $4$ species are planted together in each pot and allowed to sort naturally. Define “home” for a test species as inoculum harvested from mixed stands where that test species visually comprises the majority of biomass; define “away” as inoculum harvested from mixed stands where a different species is the majority.

Field-based conditioning: for each species, in each of $b = 3$ spatial blocks, collect rhizosphere soil from $k = 4$ distinct field individuals and pool within block to form one block-level composite inoculum per species (yielding $3$ independent donor composites per species). Feedback phase: assemble test pots with sterile background substrate and amend each pot with $10\\%$ live inoculum from a single, unique block-level composite. For each test species, create “home” pots from conspecific block-level composites and “away” pots from heterospecific block-level composites, balanced across blocks and donor species. Do not reuse any composite for more than one test pot per test species. Analyze with block-level composite identity as a random effect and block as a factor.\n\nE. Subsampling a single donor. Conditioning phase: grow $n$ pots per species, select one conditioning pot per species as the donor, and split its inoculum into $q = 10$ equal portions. Feedback phase: use those $q$ subsamples to inoculate $q$ test pots for “home” and another $q$ for “away,” and treat all $q$ pots as independent replicates in analysis because the subsamples occupy different pots and bench positions.\n\nChoose all that apply.", "solution": "The problem requires the identification of experimental protocols that satisfy two criteria for a plant-soil feedback (PSF) study: (i) implementation of a valid home–away comparison, and (ii) avoidance of pseudoreplication. A valid home–away comparison, as per the problem statement, involves contrasting the effects of inoculum from a conspecific monoculture (\"home\") with that from a heterospecific monoculture (\"away\"). Pseudoreplication is explicitly defined as using non-independent subsamples as if they were independent replicates. In this context, the experimental unit for the soil conditioning treatment is an independently conditioned pot of soil. True replication requires multiple such independent units. Subsampling a single unit, or a single pooled composite, and treating the subsamples as independent replicates is the fundamental error of pseudoreplication. The study involves $s = 4$ plant species and at least $n \\ge 5$ conditioning pots per species.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option against these two criteria.\n\nA. Two-phase design with independent donor identity retained.\nThis protocol describes growing $n$ independent conditioning pots for each of the $s = 4$ species. Critically, the inoculum from each of these $n$ pots is kept separate. In the feedback phase, each test pot is inoculated with soil from a single, unique conditioning pot. A test plant of a given species receives \"home\" inoculum from one of its conspecific conditioning pots and \"away\" inoculum from a heterospecific conditioning pot.\n(i) Home–Away Comparison: This design correctly implements the home–away comparison using inocula from monocultures. This criterion is met.\n(ii) Pseudoreplication: The unit of replication is the individual conditioning pot. By keeping inocula from each of the $n$ conditioning pots separate and using them to inoculate individual test pots, the design maintains $n$ true, independent replicates for each conditioning species. The proposed statistical analysis, which treats donor pot identity as a random effect, correctly accounts for the variation among these true replicates. This protocol is the ideal design to avoid pseudoreplication. This criterion is met.\nTherefore, this option is **Correct**.\n\nB. Species-level composite inocula.\nThis protocol involves pooling the soil from all $n$ conditioning pots of a given species into a single, large composite inoculum for that species. Feedback pots are then created by taking subsamples from these species-level composites. The analysis proposes treating the $20$ resulting test pots as $20$ independent replicates.\n(i) Home–Away Comparison: The design contrasts \"home\" soil (from the conspecific composite) with \"away\" soil (from a heterospecific composite). This criterion is met.\n(ii) Pseudoreplication: This design commits a classic error of pseudoreplication. By pooling all $n$ independent conditioning pots, the true replication is lost. All subsamples drawn from a single composite are non-independent; they are subsamples of a single experimental unit (the composite itself). The true number of replicates for the conditioning treatment is $N=1$ per species. Treating the $20$ test pots as $20$ replicates fatally inflates the degrees of freedom for the statistical test, leading to an artificially small error term and a high probability of a Type I error (falsely detecting a significant effect). This criterion is not met.\nTherefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Community-conditioned soils.\nThis protocol uses conditioning in mixed-species stands, not monocultures. \"Home\" is defined as soil from a plot where the test species is dominant, and \"away\" is soil where a different species is dominant.\n(i) Home–Away Comparison: The problem statement explicitly defines the conditioning phase as growing each species in monoculture. This protocol violates this fundamental premise. It tests a different, though potentially interesting, hypothesis about community dominance, not the standard conspecific-monoculture versus heterospecific-monoculture PSF effect. This criterion is not met.\n(ii) Pseudoreplication: The analysis is secondary, as the first criterion is not met.\nTherefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Blocked composite donors with retained replication.\nThis protocol describes a field-based conditioning phase, which is a departure from the greenhouse setting in the main problem description. However, the logical structure of the experimental design is what must be evaluated. In each of $b=3$ spatial blocks, soil from $k=4$ individuals of a species is pooled to create a block-level composite. This procedure yields $3$ independent composite inocula per species. In the feedback phase, each test pot is inoculated from a single, unique block-level composite.\n(i) Home–Away Comparison: The design correctly contrasts \"home\" (conspecific block-level composite) and \"away\" (heterospecific block-level composite) inocula. This criterion is met.\n(ii) Pseudoreplication: This is a sophisticated design that correctly manages replication. The key is that the pooling occurs *within* blocks, but the blocks themselves are independent. The experimental units for the conditioning treatment are the $b=3$ independent block-level composites for each species. By using these composites as the source of inoculum for different test pots and analyzing the data with `block` and `composite identity` as factors, the design maintains true replication. The true number of replicates for the soil conditioning treatment per species is $b=3$. This protocol successfully avoids pseudoreplication by creating and maintaining independent composite replicates. This criterion is met.\nTherefore, this option is **Correct**.\n\nE. Subsampling a single donor.\nThis protocol involves selecting only one conditioning pot per species. The inoculum from this single pot is then subdivided into $q=10$ portions to create $q=10$ test pots, which are then treated as independent replicates in the analysis.\n(i) Home–Away Comparison: A contrast is made between soil from a single conspecific pot and a single heterospecific pot. This criterion is met.\n(ii) Pseudoreplication: This is an extreme case of pseudoreplication. The true number of replicates for the conditioning treatment is $N=1$. The $q=10$ test pots are simply subsamples (pseudoreplicates) of this single conditioning unit. The justification that they are independent because they are in different physical pots is a fallacy; their inocula are not independently derived. This design makes it impossible to distinguish the effect of the treatment (e.g., species 1 conditioning) from the idiosyncratic properties of the single donor pot chosen. This criterion is not met.\nTherefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, only protocols A and D correctly implement a valid home-away comparison while properly managing replication to avoid pseudoreplication.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2522447"}, {"introduction": "Having learned to measure feedback and design experiments, we now scale up to predict the consequences for an entire community.
