Provisioning is energetically linear, so the budget constraint is $E = n z$ with $n \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$. Offspring survival is an increasing, saturating function of per-offspring investment given by $s(z) = 1 - \\exp(-k z)$ with $k0$ a parameter summarizing how efficiently energy investment translates into survival.

The Smith-Fretwell model, which this problem is a variant of, is a foundational concept. The functional forms and constraints are standard and plausible simplifications for modeling biological trade-offs. The problem is free of pseudoscience.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. An objective function ($W$) is provided, along with a set of clear constraints ($E=nz$, $z \\ge z_{\\min}$). The goal is to find the values of the decision variables ($n, z$) that maximize the objective function. The allowance of $n \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$ is a standard simplification for analytical tractability in such models.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective mathematical language.\n- **Other Flaws**: The problem is self-contained, its premises are consistent, and it does not contain undefined terms or logical fallacies.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to maximize the expected fitness, $W$, which is defined as the product of the number of offspring, $n$, and the probability of survival for each offspring, $s(z)$.\n$$W = n \\, s(z)$$\nThe optimization is subject to two primary constraints:\n1.  A fixed energy budget: $E = n z$, where $E=10$.\n2.  A minimum per-offspring provisioning level: $z \\ge z_{\\min}$, where $z_{\\min}=1$.\n\nFirst, we reduce the problem to a single-variable maximization problem. From the budget constraint, we can express the clutch size $n$ as a function of the per-offspring investment $z$:\n$$n(z) = \\frac{E}{z}$$\nSubstituting this expression and the given survival function, $s(z) = 1 - \\exp(-k z)$, into the fitness function $W$, we obtain fitness as a function of $z$ alone:\n$$W(z) = \\frac{E}{z} \\left(1 - \\exp(-k z)\\right)$$\nThe optimization problem is now to maximize $W(z)$ subject to the constraint $z \\ge 1$. Since $E=10$ is a positive constant, maximizing $W(z)$ is equivalent to maximizing $\\frac{W(z)}{E} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-kz)}{z}$.\n\nTo find if an interior optimum exists for $z0$, we must find the critical points of $W(z)$ by taking its derivative with respect to $z$ and setting it to zero. Using the quotient rule for differentiation:\n$$\\frac{dW}{dz} = E \\left[ \\frac{z \\frac{d}{dz}(1 - \\exp(-kz)) - (1 - \\exp(-kz))\\frac{d}{dz}(z)}{z^2} \\right]$$\nThe derivative of the numerator's term is $\\frac{d}{dz}(1 - \\exp(-kz)) = -(-k)\\exp(-kz) = k\\exp(-kz)$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\frac{dW}{dz}$:\n$$\\frac{dW}{dz} = E \\left[ \\frac{z(k\\exp(-kz)) - (1 - \\exp(-kz))}{z^2} \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{dW}{dz} = \\frac{E}{z^2} \\left[ kz\\exp(-kz) - 1 + \\exp(-kz) \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{dW}{dz} = \\frac{E}{z^2} \\left[ (kz+1)\\exp(-kz) - 1 \\right]$$\nFor an interior optimum to exist, the necessary condition is $\\frac{dW}{dz} = 0$. Since $E  0$ and $z^2  0$ for any relevant $z$, this condition simplifies to:\n$$(kz+1)\\exp(-kz) - 1 = 0$$\n$$(kz+1) = \\exp(kz)$$\nLet us analyze the equation $x+1 = \\exp(x)$ with the substitution $x=kz$. A trivial solution is $x=0$, which corresponds to $z=0$. To determine if other solutions exist, we examine the function $f(x) = \\exp(x) - (x+1)$. Its derivative is $f'(x) = \\exp(x) - 1$.\n- For $x  0$, $f'(x)  0$, so $f(x)$ is strictly increasing.\n- For $x  0$, $f'(x)  0$, so $f(x)$ is strictly decreasing.\nThis shows that $f(x)$ has a global minimum at $x=0$, where $f(0) = \\exp(0) - (0+1) = 0$. Therefore, for any $x \\neq 0$, we have $f(x)  0$, which means $\\exp(x)  x+1$.\nConsequently, the only real solution to $(kz+1) = \\exp(kz)$ is $kz=0$. Since $k0$, this implies $z=0$. A solution at $z=0$ is not a biologically meaningful interior optimum; it corresponds to an infinite clutch size of zero-provisioned offspring with zero survival.\n\nFurthermore, for any $z0$, $kz0$, which implies $\\exp(kz)  kz+1$. Dividing by the positive term $\\exp(kz)$ yields $1  (kz+1)\\exp(-kz)$. This can be rearranged to:\n$$(kz+1)\\exp(-kz) - 1  0$$\nThis demonstrates that the term in the brackets in the derivative expression is always negative for $z0$.\n$$\\frac{dW}{dz} = \\frac{E}{z^2} \\times (\\text{a negative value})  0 \\quad \\text{for all } z  0$$\nThe finding that $\\frac{dW}{dz}  0$ for all $z0$ is critical. It establishes that the fitness function $W(z)$ is a strictly monotonically decreasing function of per-offspring investment $z$ over its entire valid domain.\n\nThe task is to maximize this monotonically decreasing function $W(z)$ on the interval defined by the constraint $z \\ge z_{\\min} = 1$. A monotonically decreasing function on a closed interval attains its maximum value at the lowest possible value of its argument. Therefore, the optimal investment $z^*$ must be at the lower boundary of the permissible domain.\n$$z^* = z_{\\min} = 1$$\nThis is the optimal per-offspring provisioning.\n\nThe corresponding optimal clutch size, $n^*$, is found using the budget constraint:\n$$n^* = \\frac{E}{z^*} = \\frac{10}{1} = 10$$\nThus, the optimal strategy is to produce a clutch of $10$ offspring, each provisioned with $1$ unit of energy.\n\nFinally, we must evaluate how an increase in the parameter $k$ alters the optimal provisioning $z^*$. The parameter $k$ quantifies the efficiency of converting investment into survival. Our derivation shows that for any $k0$, the fitness function $W(z)$ is always monotonically decreasing in $z$. The optimization result is therefore a corner solution, determined entirely by the boundary constraint $z_{\\min}$ and not by the specific value of $k$. An increase in $k$ will increase the value of the maximum fitness $W(z^*)$ but will not change the location $z^*$ of that maximum. Therefore, the optimal provisioning level $z^*$ is independent of $k$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1  10 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2503195"}, {"introduction": "Life history strategies involve trade-offs that play out across an organism's entire life cycle.

Using the chain rule for derivatives, $\\frac{d}{dx}\\ln(u) = \\frac{1}{u}\\frac{du}{dx}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dg} \\ln\\left(s_{d}(1-g) + g s_{k}\\right) = \\frac{1}{s_{d}(1-g) + g s_{k}} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dg}\\left(s_{d} - g s_{d} + g s_{k}\\right) = \\frac{s_{k} - s_{d}}{s_{d}(1-g) + g s_{k}}\n$$\nwhere $s_k$ can be either $s_g$ or $s_b$. Applying this to our objective function $L(g)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{dg} = p \\left(\\frac{s_{g} - s_{d}}{s_{d}(1-g) + g s_{g}}\\right) + (1-p) \\left(\\frac{s_{b} - s_{d}}{s_{d}(1-g) + g s_{b}}\\right)\n$$\nSetting this derivative to zero at $g = g^{\\star}$:\n$$\np \\frac{s_{g} - s_{d}}{s_{d}(1-g^{\\star}) + g^{\\star} s_{g}} = -(1-p) \\frac{s_{b} - s_{d}}{s_{d}(1-g^{\\star}) + g^{\\star} s_{b}}\n$$\nGiven the assumption $s_{g}  s_{d}  s_{b}$, we have $s_{g} - s_{d}  0$ and $s_{b} - s_{d}  0$. We can rewrite the equation as:\n$$\np \\frac{s_{g} - s_{d}}{s_{d}(1-g^{\\star}) + g^{\\star} s_{g}} = (1-p) \\frac{s_{d} - s_{b}}{s_{d}(1-g^{\\star}) + g^{\\star} s_{b}}\n$$\nTo solve for $g^{\\star}$, we cross-multiply:\n$$\np (s_{g} - s_{d}) \\left[s_{d}(1-g^{\\star}) + g^{\\star} s_{b}\\right] = (1-p) (s_{d} - s_{b}) \\left[s_{d}(1-g^{\\star}) + g^{\\star} s_{g}\\right]\n$$\nThis equation is linear in $g^{\\star}$. We expand both sides to isolate the terms containing $g^{\\star}$.\nLet us rewrite the terms in brackets as $s_{d} + g^{\\star}(s_{b} - s_{d})$ and $s_{d} + g^{\\star}(s_{g} - s_{d})$.\n$$\np (s_{g} - s_{d}) \\left[s_{d} - g^{\\star}(s_{d} - s_{b})\\right] = (1-p) (s_{d} - s_{b}) \\left[s_{d} + g^{\\star}(s_{g} - s_{d})\\right]\n$$\nExpanding and collecting terms:\n$$\np s_{d} (s_{g} - s_{d}) - p g^{\\star} (s_{g} - s_{d})(s_{d} - s_{b}) = (1-p) s_{d} (s_{d} - s_{b}) + (1-p) g^{\\star} (s_{d} - s_{b})(s_{g} - s_{d})\n$$\nMove all terms involving $g^{\\star}$ to one side and constant terms to the other:\n$$\np s_{d} (s_{g} - s_{d}) - (1-p) s_{d} (s_{d} - s_{b}) = g^{\\star} \\left[ (1-p) (s_{d} - s_{b})(s_{g} - s_{d}) + p (s_{g} - s_{d})(s_{d} - s_{b}) \\right]\n$$\nFactor out common terms on both sides of the equation.\nLeft-hand side (LHS):\n$$\n\\text{LHS} = s_{d} \\left[ p(s_{g} - s_{d}) - (1-p)(s_{d} - s_{b}) \\right] = s_{d} \\left[ p s_{g} - p s_{d} - s_{d} + p s_{d} + s_{b} - p s_{b} \\right] = s_{d} \\left[ p s_{g} + (1-p)s_{b} - s_{d} \\right]\n$$\nRight-hand side (RHS):\n$$\n\\text{RHS} = g^{\\star} (s_{g} - s_{d})(s_{d} - s_{b}) \\left[ (1-p) + p \\right] = g^{\\star} (s_{g} - s_{d})(s_{d} - s_{b})\n$$\nEquating the simplified LHS and RHS:\n$$\ns_{d} \\left[ p s_{g} + (1-p)s_{b} - s_{d} \\right] = g^{\\star} (s_{g} - s_{d})(s_{d} - s_{b})\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $g^{\\star}$ by dividing by the coefficient of $g^{\\star}$:\n$$\ng^{\\star} = \\frac{s_{d} \\left[ p s_{g} + (1-p)s_{b} - s_{d} \\right]}{(s_{g} - s_{d})(s_{d} - s_{b})}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the optimal germination fraction. The second derivative of $L(g)$ is strictly negative for $g \\in (0,1)$, confirming that this stationary point is indeed a maximum.
