## Introduction
The [biosphere](@entry_id:183762), the thin veil of life enveloping our planet, presents a staggering diversity of forms and functions. From the microscopic life deep within the Earth's crust to the vast expanses of tropical rainforests, understanding this complexity requires a systematic framework. How do scientists organize this biodiversity into [coherent units](@entry_id:149899), and what principles govern their global distribution and function? This article addresses this fundamental challenge by exploring the concept of [biomes](@entry_id:139994)—the world's major ecological communities, classified by their dominant vegetation and shaped by climate.

This exploration is structured into three distinct chapters. The first, **Principles and Mechanisms**, lays the theoretical groundwork. It will dissect the hierarchy of ecological systems from communities to [biomes](@entry_id:139994), examine the climate- and soil-based classification systems that define them, and delve into the [functional traits](@entry_id:181313) and disturbance regimes that govern their internal dynamics. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, transitions from theory to practice. Here, we will discover how scientists use satellite [remote sensing](@entry_id:149993) and sophisticated models to monitor the biosphere's health, analyze its crucial role in the global carbon and [nutrient cycles](@entry_id:171494), and predict its response to anthropogenic change. Finally, the third chapter, **Hands-On Practices**, provides an opportunity to apply these concepts directly, offering practical exercises in [biome classification](@entry_id:138444), carbon flux analysis, and landscape-scale budget calculations. Together, these chapters provide a comprehensive, graduate-level journey into the science of [biomes](@entry_id:139994) and the biosphere.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### Defining the Scale: From Biomes to Communities

To understand the biosphere, we must organize its immense complexity into [coherent units](@entry_id:149899). This is achieved through a hierarchical system of classification, where each level is defined by the dominant processes that structure it. At the broadest scale are **[biomes](@entry_id:139994)**, continental to sub-continental expanses of vegetation whose characteristic form and function are shaped by macroclimate. The biome concept is rooted in the principle of **convergent evolution**: similar climatic regimes across geographically disjunct regions filter for similar plant strategies, resulting in structurally similar vegetation, even if the constituent species are unrelated. For example, the succulent life form has evolved independently in the deserts of the Americas (Cactaceae) and Africa (Euphorbiaceae) in response to water scarcity. Thus, a biome is diagnosed not by its species' lineages, but by its dominant **[plant functional types](@entry_id:195453) (PFTs)**—groups of plants with similar responses to the environment and effects on ecosystem processes, such as evergreen needleleaf trees, drought-deciduous broadleaf shrubs, or C4 grasses. The spatial extent of a terrestrial biome is vast, typically on the order of $10^5$ to $10^7 \, \mathrm{km^2}$ [@problem_id:2473776].

This hierarchy of ecological organization proceeds to finer scales. Nested within [biomes](@entry_id:139994) are **ecoregions**, which are large but sub-biome units spanning roughly $10^4$ to $10^5 \, \mathrm{km^2}$. While an ecoregion shares the general climate and physiognomy of its parent biome, its boundaries are defined by a unique combination of regional [geology](@entry_id:142210), soils, disturbance history, and, most importantly, a shared biogeographic history. This shared history results in a distinct species pool with a certain degree of [endemism](@entry_id:187831). For instance, the Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests biome contains both the Appalachian-Blue Ridge Forests ecoregion in North America and the European Atlantic Mixed Forests ecoregion; their vegetation structure is broadly similar, but their species compositions are almost entirely different due to continental separation. The diagnostic criteria for ecoregions therefore shift from plant function to taxonomic turnover and [endemism](@entry_id:187831).

At the finest scale are **communities**, which are local assemblages of interacting populations. Spanning from meters to a few kilometers ($10^{-3}$ to $10^1 \, \mathrm{km^2}$), communities are structured by local environmental filters—such as [microclimate](@entry_id:195467), topography, and specific soil properties—and, crucially, by contemporary [biotic interactions](@entry_id:196274) like competition, [predation](@entry_id:142212), and mutualism. Here, the focus is on species co-occurrence patterns and the structure of their interaction networks. This hierarchical framework, from biome to ecoregion to community, reflects a transition in dominant structuring forces: from macroclimatic filtering at the broadest scale, to biogeographic history at the intermediate scale, to local abiotic conditions and [biotic interactions](@entry_id:196274) at the finest scale [@problem_id:2473776].

### The Climatic Blueprint of Terrestrial Biomes

The strong link between macroclimate and vegetation form has long inspired ecologists to create classification systems that map the world’s [biomes](@entry_id:139994) based on climatic variables. Two of the most influential frameworks are Whittaker’s biome diagram and the Holdridge life zone system.

Robert Whittaker’s diagram is an empirical model that plots major biome types in a two-dimensional space defined by **mean annual temperature ($T$)** and **mean annual precipitation ($P$)**. These two variables serve as effective first-order proxies for the energy and water available to plants. In this climate space, [biomes](@entry_id:139994) such as tropical rainforest, temperate grassland, and tundra occupy distinct, though often overlapping, envelopes. The model's strength lies in its simplicity and its powerful visual illustration of how water and energy gradients shape global vegetation patterns. However, by relying on annual means, the Whittaker diagram implicitly assumes that intra-annual variability, or seasonality, is a secondary factor [@problem_id:2473756].

The Holdridge life zone system offers a more formalized, albeit still empirical, approach. It is structured as a logarithmic, hexagonal lattice based on three axes: annual precipitation, a dryness index, and, most notably, **biotemperature**. Biotemperature is a more physiologically relevant measure of thermal energy for growth than mean annual temperature. It is calculated as the annual mean of monthly temperatures, after first setting any monthly value below $0\,^\circ \mathrm{C}$ to $0\,^\circ \mathrm{C}$. This truncation accounts for periods when temperature is too cold for metabolic activity. Consequently, two locations with identical mean annual temperature and [precipitation](@entry_id:144409) can be classified into different life zones if their seasonality causes them to cross these truncation thresholds [@problem_id:2473756]. For example, a maritime climate with a mild, narrow temperature range might have the same mean annual temperature as a continental climate with very cold winters and warm summers, but the latter's biotemperature would be higher due to the truncation of its sub-zero winter months. The Holdridge system also incorporates an explicit dryness index, the ratio of potential [evapotranspiration](@entry_id:180694) to [precipitation](@entry_id:144409) ($\mathrm{PET}/P$), and formalizes the equivalence between latitude and altitude by defining altitudinal belts that correspond to latitudinal regions based on a constant environmental lapse rate.

### Beyond the Blueprint: The Complexity of Biome Delimitation

While climate-based classifications like those of Whittaker and Holdridge provide a powerful [first-order approximation](@entry_id:147559) of global biome distribution, they are ultimately insufficient for unique and precise delimitation. The relationship between climate and vegetation is complicated by several key factors that can cause the climate-biome mapping to be non-unique [@problem_id:2473780].

First, mean annual temperature ($T$) is a crude proxy for the energy balance that drives plant water use. A more mechanistic understanding comes from the concept of **potential [evapotranspiration](@entry_id:180694) ($\mathrm{PET}$)**, which is the atmospheric demand for water, determined by solar radiation, humidity, and wind speed, as well as temperature. Plant productivity is tightly linked to **actual [evapotranspiration](@entry_id:180694) ($\mathrm{ET}$)**, which is constrained by both water supply ($P$) and atmospheric demand ($\mathrm{PET}$). This fundamental constraint can be expressed as $\mathrm{ET} \le \min(P, \mathrm{PET})$. Simple $T$-$P$ diagrams do not adequately capture this interaction.

Second, plant survival and function are often determined by **climatic extremes**, not annual means. For instance, the poleward limit of many broadleaf evergreen trees is set by the absolute minimum winter temperature and the risk of freezing-induced [xylem embolism](@entry_id:170538), a parameter not captured by mean annual temperature or even a simple seasonality metric. Similarly, the length of the growing season is a critical control that can vary significantly between locations with the same mean annual temperature.

Third, **edaphic (soil) factors** can fundamentally alter the water balance experienced by plants. A sandy soil with low water-holding capacity can create drought stress in a climate that a clay-rich soil would render mesic. Therefore, the same climatic input $(T, P)$ can support different vegetation types depending on the underlying soil texture and depth.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the assumption of a unique climatic equilibrium is broken by the existence of **[alternative stable states](@entry_id:142098)**. These are distinct, self-perpetuating ecosystems that can exist under the same climatic and edaphic conditions. The classic example is the boundary between forest and savanna. In many tropical and temperate regions, the climate could support a closed-canopy forest. However, the presence of a frequent [fire regime](@entry_id:191561), which kills tree saplings but not grasses, can maintain the system in a stable, open savanna state. The grass-fire feedback (grasses provide fuel for fires, which in turn favor grasses over trees) creates a [basin of attraction](@entry_id:142980) that is difficult to leave. Similar feedbacks involving [herbivory](@entry_id:147608) or human activity can also create and maintain [alternative stable states](@entry_id:142098), meaning that different [biomes](@entry_id:139994) can occupy overlapping regions of climate space [@problem_id:2473780].

### The Functional Basis of Biome Structure: Plant Functional Types

The principle of convergence, where similar climates foster similar vegetation forms, operates through [environmental filtering](@entry_id:193391) on plant traits. This has led to the powerful concepts of **Plant Functional Types (PFTs)** and the **Leaf Economics Spectrum (LES)**. A PFT is a group of species that share similar functional characteristics and ecological roles, regardless of their evolutionary history. The LES describes a major axis of variation in plant strategy, representing a trade-off between rapid resource acquisition and long-term resource conservation [@problem_id:2473752].

This spectrum is defined by a suite of coordinated leaf traits. At one end, "acquisitive" species have leaves with high **[specific leaf area](@entry_id:194206) ($\mathrm{SLA}$**, leaf area per unit dry mass). These leaves are typically thin, structurally "cheap," and have high mass-based nitrogen concentration ($N_{\mathrm{mass}}$) and, consequently, a high mass-based maximum [carboxylation](@entry_id:169430) capacity ($V_{\mathrm{max, mass}}$), a measure of photosynthetic potential. This allows for rapid carbon gain in high-resource environments, but the trade-off is a short [leaf lifespan](@entry_id:199745). At the other end, "conservative" species have leaves with low $\mathrm{SLA}$ (and thus high **leaf mass per area, $\mathrm{LMA} = 1/\mathrm{SLA}$**). These leaves are thick, dense, structurally robust, and have lower $N_{\mathrm{mass}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{max, mass}}$. Their construction is a greater investment, but they are more durable and have a longer lifespan, which is advantageous in stressful or low-resource environments [@problem_id:2473752].

Understanding the relationships between these traits requires careful attention to their units (per mass vs. per area). The conversion between bases is governed by the simple relationship: $X_{\mathrm{area}} = X_{\mathrm{mass}} \times \mathrm{LMA}$, or equivalently, $X_{\mathrm{area}} = X_{\mathrm{mass}} / \mathrm{SLA}$. This mathematical rule has profound ecological consequences. For example, while $\mathrm{SLA}$ and $V_{\mathrm{max, mass}}$ are positively correlated along the LES, the relationship between $\mathrm{SLA}$ and area-based photosynthetic capacity ($V_{\mathrm{max, area}}$) is typically negative. This is because as $\mathrm{SLA}$ increases, $N_{\mathrm{mass}}$ increases, but not proportionally. The result is that the ratio $N_{\mathrm{mass}}/\mathrm{SLA}$, which is equal to $N_{\mathrm{area}}$, decreases as $\mathrm{SLA}$ increases. Because $V_{\mathrm{max, area}}$ is proportional to $N_{\mathrm{area}}$, it also decreases. This highlights a critical insight: the sign of a trait-trait covariance can depend entirely on the basis (mass or area) on which the traits are expressed [@problem_id:2473752].

### The Role of Disturbance Regimes

Disturbance is not an external anomaly but an integral process that shapes the structure, function, and boundaries of many [biomes](@entry_id:139994). An ecosystem's characteristic pattern of disturbance is known as its **[disturbance regime](@entry_id:155176)**, which can be described by four key parameters: frequency, intensity, size, and seasonality [@problem_id:2473785].

-   **Frequency** is the recurrence rate of disturbance at a point, typically defined as the inverse of the mean return interval.
-   **Intensity** is a [physical measure](@entry_id:264060) of the energy released during a disturbance event. For fire, this is often quantified by Byram's fireline intensity (in kilowatts per meter), which measures the rate of energy release per unit length of the fire front.
-   **Size** refers to the spatial extent of a single disturbance event. The distribution of event sizes for a given landscape is typically right-skewed, with many small events and a few very large ones.
-   **Seasonality** describes the time of year when disturbances are most likely to occur, governed by climatic cycles that influence factors like fuel moisture or wind patterns.

Contrasting fire-prone [biomes](@entry_id:139994) illustrates how these parameters combine to create unique regimes. A **tropical savanna** is characterized by a high-frequency (return interval of 1–3 years), low-intensity [fire regime](@entry_id:191561). Frequent surface fires burn through cured grasses during the late dry season, preventing tree establishment. In contrast, a **Mediterranean chaparral** shrubland has a low-frequency (30–60 years), very high-intensity regime. Fuels accumulate for decades, leading to massive, wind-driven crown fires in the late summer and autumn. A **boreal coniferous forest** exhibits an even lower frequency (80–150+ years), but the stand-replacing fires that occur in mid-summer can be of high intensity and reach enormous sizes due to vast, contiguous fuel loads and limited suppression capacity [@problem_id:2473785]. These distinct regimes are fundamental to the persistence of each biome.

### Ecosystem Dynamics: Succession and Stability

Following a disturbance, ecosystems undergo a process of change known as **succession**. The nature of this process depends critically on the state of the site post-disturbance. **Primary succession** occurs on entirely new substrates devoid of life and soil, such as a fresh lava flow or a landscape scoured by a retreating glacier. It is an extremely slow process that requires the initial formation of soil through weathering and colonization by [pioneer species](@entry_id:140345). **Secondary succession**, in contrast, occurs on sites where a disturbance has removed the previous community but left the soil and biological legacies—such as seeds, spores, and belowground roots and rhizomes—intact. The recovery following a forest fire is a classic example of [secondary succession](@entry_id:146530) [@problem_id:2473754].

The dynamics of recovery are described by concepts of [ecological stability](@entry_id:152823), primarily **resistance** and **resilience**. Resistance is the ability of an ecosystem to withstand a disturbance and avoid being changed. Resilience is the rate at which it recovers its structure and function afterward. These concepts can be illustrated by comparing recovery trajectories. For instance, after a lava flow completely covers a forest, the system's Net Primary Productivity ($\mathrm{NPP}$) drops to zero, indicating very low resistance. Recovery via [primary succession](@entry_id:142037) is extremely slow, taking many decades to approach the previous state, indicating very low resilience. A site subject to a low-intensity surface fire, however, might retain $40\%$ of its $\mathrm{NPP}$ in the first post-fire year (higher resistance) and recover to $95\%$ of its pre-fire $\mathrm{NPP}$ within five years (higher resilience). This rapid recovery is mechanistically driven by the persistence of soil, [seed banks](@entry_id:182563), and resprouting organs, which are absent in [primary succession](@entry_id:142037) [@problem_id:2473754] [@problem_id:2473754].

It is vital to distinguish this concept of resilience—often called engineering resilience—from a broader concept of **[ecological resilience](@entry_id:151311)**, which refers to the ability of a system to remain within a particular **basin of attraction**. A biome may recover a functional metric like productivity but fail to return to its original structural state, representing a shift to an alternative stable state. For example, if a forest is disturbed and repeated fires then maintain it as a savanna, the system has crossed into the savanna's [basin of attraction](@entry_id:142980). In this context, the original forest state lacked resilience to that sequence of perturbations, even if the savanna's productivity eventually matches that of the old forest [@problem_id:2473754]. Persistence, the ability to remain in a given state, is thus tied to the depth of these basins of attraction and the strength of the feedbacks that maintain them.

### The Foundation Beneath: Soils as a Product and Controller of Biomes

The relationship between [biomes](@entry_id:139994) and soils is deeply reciprocal: climate and organisms are primary drivers of [soil formation](@entry_id:181520) ([pedogenesis](@entry_id:180440)), and the resulting soils, in turn, filter and constrain the vegetation that can grow. The **state [factor model](@entry_id:141879)**, famously articulated by Hans Jenny, provides a framework for understanding this relationship: soil properties are a function of the integrated effects of **Cl**imate, **O**rganisms, **R**elief (topography), **P**arent material, and **T**ime (CLORPT) [@problem_id:2473808].

The interaction of these factors across different [biomes](@entry_id:139994) produces distinct soil types, formally classified into soil orders.
-   In semi-arid **temperate grasslands** (e.g., prairies), a climate with a water deficit ($P  \mathrm{PET}$) limits leaching. The dense, deep roots of grasses contribute vast amounts of organic matter, forming a thick, dark, fertile, base-rich topsoil (a mollic epipedon). The combination of base-rich parent material (like [loess](@entry_id:636680)) and limited leaching often leads to the accumulation of carbonates in the subsoil. These are the defining features of **Mollisols**, some of the world's most productive agricultural soils.
-   In humid **temperate broadleaf forests**, a positive water balance ($P > \mathrm{PET}$) drives moderate leaching. Clays are washed from the surface horizons and accumulate in the subsoil, forming an argillic horizon. On relatively young, base-rich parent material (like glacial till), base saturation remains moderate. This profile defines the **Alfisols**.
-   In cool, humid **boreal conifer forests**, the combination of high water surplus, acidic litter from coniferous trees, and permeable sandy parent material drives an intense leaching process called podzolization. Organic acids strip iron and aluminum from the upper soil, creating a bleached (albic) horizon, and deposit them in a dark subsurface (spodic) horizon, characteristic of **Spodosols**.
-   In hot, wet **tropical rainforests** on ancient, stable landscapes, millions of years of intense weathering and extreme leaching ($P \gg \mathrm{PET}$) destroy nearly all weatherable minerals, leaving a soil dominated by low-activity clays and iron/aluminum oxides. This intensely weathered profile, with its very low nutrient-holding capacity, defines the **Oxisols**.
-   In the **arctic tundra**, the overriding factor is the cold climate, which maintains **permafrost** (perennially frozen ground) near the surface. Any soil with permafrost within $100 \, \mathrm{cm}$ is classified as a **Gelisol**, where freeze-thaw cycles physically churn the soil (cryoturbation) [@problem_id:2473808].

### Biogeochemical Engines: Nutrient Cycling Across Biomes

Biomes are not static structures but dynamic systems that process vast quantities of energy and matter. Their function is governed by [biogeochemical cycles](@entry_id:147568), of which the nitrogen (N) cycle is a paramount example. The flow of nitrogen is controlled by a series of key microbial transformations, whose rates vary dramatically across [biomes](@entry_id:139994) due to differing environmental controls [@problem_id:2473784].

1.  **Biological Nitrogen Fixation**: The conversion of atmospheric $\mathrm{N}_2$ gas to bioavailable ammonia ($\mathrm{NH}_3$). This process is catalyzed by the [nitrogenase enzyme](@entry_id:194267), which is energetically very expensive and irreversibly inhibited by oxygen. $\mathrm{N}_2$ fixation is thus limited by energy supply, [micronutrients](@entry_id:146912) (e.g., Mo, Fe), and the absence of oxygen, and it is often downregulated when mineral nitrogen is already abundant.
2.  **Mineralization (Ammonification)**: The decomposition of organic matter by heterotrophic microbes, releasing nitrogen as ammonium ($\mathrm{NH}_4^+$). Its rate depends on temperature, moisture, and the quality ($\mathrm{C:N}$ ratio) of the organic substrate.
3.  **Nitrification**: The aerobic oxidation of ammonium to nitrate ($\mathrm{NO}_3^-$). This two-step process requires oxygen and is thus restricted to well-aerated environments. It is also sensitive to temperature and typically inhibited by acidic conditions.
4.  **Denitrification**: The anaerobic reduction of nitrate to gaseous forms ($\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$ and $\mathrm{N}_2$). This is a form of [anaerobic respiration](@entry_id:145069) where microbes use nitrate as an electron acceptor when oxygen is unavailable. Its rate is limited by the simultaneous availability of nitrate, labile organic carbon (as an electron donor), and anoxic conditions.

These controls lead to distinct N-cycling dynamics in different [biomes](@entry_id:139994). In a cold, acidic, and water-saturated **boreal bog**, low temperatures and anoxia strongly suppress mineralization and [nitrification](@entry_id:172183), making nitrate scarce. Denitrification is therefore nitrate-limited despite the anoxic conditions. In a warm, well-drained **tropical wet forest**, rapid mineralization and [nitrification](@entry_id:172183) proceed in the oxic topsoil, but episodic [denitrification](@entry_id:165219) can lead to significant gaseous N losses during storm-induced anoxia. In an **arid shrubland**, all processes are severely limited by moisture and occur in brief pulses after rain events. In a heavily **fertilized agricultural field**, additions of ammonium and nitrate fuel high rates of both [nitrification](@entry_id:172183) (in aerated soil) and [denitrification](@entry_id:165219) (in irrigated or waterlogged microsites), while symbiotic $\mathrm{N}_2$ fixation is suppressed by the high availability of mineral N [@problem_id:2473784].

### The Aquatic Realm: Marine Biomes

The biome concept extends to the world's oceans, where large-scale units are delineated not by vegetation but by physical oceanographic drivers that create distinct regimes of light and nutrient availability, thereby structuring [primary production](@entry_id:143862) and food webs [@problem_id:2473767].

The fundamental physics involves Earth’s rotation (the **Coriolis effect**), wind stress, and surface buoyancy fluxes (heating/cooling, precipitation/[evaporation](@entry_id:137264)). Wind blowing over the ocean drives a net transport of water in the surface layer, known as **Ekman transport**, which is directed to the right of the wind in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern. Horizontal variations in wind (wind-stress curl) force large-scale vertical motions: divergence of Ekman transport causes [upwelling](@entry_id:201979), while convergence causes downwelling. These processes, acting at the basin scale, define the major marine [biomes](@entry_id:139994):

-   **Polar Biomes**: Delineated by seasonal sea ice, low annual light, and strong winter cooling that drives deep convection. This convection resupplies nutrients to the surface, but production is light-limited for much of the year. A brief, intense bloom follows the spring retreat of sea ice, which stratifies the surface layer with meltwater.
-   **Westerly Biomes**: In the mid- to subpolar latitudes under the westerly winds, positive wind-stress curl drives Ekman divergence ([upwelling](@entry_id:201979)). Combined with deep winter mixing, this replenishes surface nutrients. A classic spring bloom occurs as increasing light and seasonal warming re-stratify the water column.
-   **Subtropical Gyre Biomes**: Located in the vast centers of ocean basins, these regions are characterized by negative wind-stress curl, leading to Ekman convergence and downwelling. This maintains a deep, permanent [thermocline](@entry_id:195256) and strong stratification, isolating the sunlit surface waters from deep nutrients. These are the oligotrophic "deserts" of the ocean, with low productivity sustained by recycling and intermittent nutrient injections from eddies.
-   **Tropical Upwelling Biomes**: Near the equator, the easterly trade winds combined with the change in sign of the Coriolis parameter cause strong Ekman divergence and persistent [upwelling](@entry_id:201979). This brings cold, nutrient-rich water to the surface, fueling some of the world's most productive fisheries.
-   **Coastal Biomes**: Along continental margins, interactions with bathymetry, tides, rivers, and coastal winds create highly productive and variable conditions. In eastern boundary regions (e.g., off California, Peru), equatorward winds drive offshore Ekman transport, resulting in intense [coastal upwelling](@entry_id:198895) of nutrients [@problem_id:2473767].

### The Anthropocene Biosphere: Novel Ecosystems and Anthromes

In the current epoch, the Anthropocene, human activities have become a dominant force shaping the biosphere. This necessitates an expansion of the biome concept to include systems fundamentally altered or maintained by people. We can distinguish a continuum of human influence, from intact systems to fully artificial ones [@problem_id:2473774].

An **intact biome patch** represents a historical or reference state, where the ecosystem's structure, species composition, and disturbance regimes are governed primarily by regional climate and natural processes, without persistent, overriding human modification. An example would be a remote savanna where fires are ignited by lightning and herbivore populations are naturally regulated [@problem_id:2473774].

At the other extreme are **[anthropogenic biomes](@entry_id:198607)**, or **[anthromes](@entry_id:186285)**. These are ecosystems where humans exert sustained, direct control, dictating the abiotic conditions and biotic composition. The system's state is maintained by continuous inputs of energy and matter, decoupling it from the regional climate. An irrigated urban park, with its mown lawns, fertilized soils, and planted ornamental species from around the world, is a clear example. It exists not as a function of the regional climate but because of active, ongoing human management [@problem_id:2473774].

Between these two lies the important category of **[novel ecosystems](@entry_id:186997)**. These are self-organizing systems that have arisen from past human influence but persist without ongoing, intensive management. They are characterized by historically novel species combinations and/or human-altered abiotic conditions that create a persistent new state. For example, an abandoned agricultural field where past irrigation has caused soil salinization might now support a self-sustaining community of salt-tolerant native and non-native plants. The system is not "intact" because its abiotic foundation and species composition are fundamentally altered, and return to the historical [reference state](@entry_id:151465) is unlikely without major intervention. Yet, it is not an anthrome because it is not actively managed. It has become a new, self-perpetuating ecological entity—a [novel ecosystem](@entry_id:197984) [@problem_id:2473774]. Recognizing this spectrum from intact [biomes](@entry_id:139994) to [anthromes](@entry_id:186285) and [novel ecosystems](@entry_id:186997) is essential for understanding and managing the modern biosphere.
