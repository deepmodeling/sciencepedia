It describes a classic linear box model, a fundamental construct in the study of dynamical systems, particularly in biogeochemistry and environmental engineering. The underlying principle is the conservation of mass, and the kinetics are described by a standard first-order linear ordinary differential equation. The problem provides all necessary conditions to deduce a unique, stable solution. Therefore, we proceed with the derivation.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Governing Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)**\n\nThe principle of conservation of mass dictates that the time rate of change of a conserved quantity within a defined volume is equal to the total rate of input minus the total rate of output. Let $R(t)$ represent the mass of the tracer in the reservoir at time $t$.\n\nThe rate of change of this mass is given by the derivative $\\frac{dR}{dt}$.\n\nThe rate of input is explicitly given as an exogenous function $F_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)$.\n\nThe rate of output is described as a first-order sink with a rate constant $k > 0$. The well-mixed assumption implies that this loss rate is proportional to the total mass $R(t)$ currently in the reservoir. Thus, the output rate is $k R(t)$.\n\nApplying the conservation principle:\n$$\n\\frac{d R(t)}{dt} = \\text{Inputs} - \\text{Outputs}\n$$\nSubstituting the defined terms, we obtain the governing ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{d R(t)}{dt} = F_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) - k R(t)\n$$\nThe physical interpretation of each term is as follows:\n- $\\frac{dR(t)}{dt}$: This is the instantaneous net rate of change of the tracer mass $R$ within the reservoir.\n- $F_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)$: This is the rate of new mass being added to the reservoir from an external source. It is the forcing term of the system.\n- $-k R(t)$: This is the rate of mass removal from the reservoir. The negative sign signifies a loss or sink. The term's proportionality to $R(t)$ indicates a first-order process, where $k$ is the constant of proportionality, representing the fractional loss rate per unit time (units of time$^{-1}$).\n\n**2. Solution for a Step-Change in Forcing**\n\nFor the time period $t \\ge 0$, the input is stepped to a constant value, $F_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) = F_1$. The governing ODE becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = F_1 - kR\n$$\nThis can be written in the standard form for a first-order linear ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} + kR = F_1\n$$\nTo find the unique solution, we must determine the initial condition $R(0)$. The problem states that for $t < 0$, the system was at steady state with a constant input $F_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) = F_0$. At steady state, the mass is constant, meaning $\\frac{dR}{dt} = 0$. Substituting this into the general ODE for the pre-$0$ conditions:\n$$\n0 = F_0 - k R_{\\mathrm{ss}}\n$$\nwhere $R_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ is the steady-state mass for $t < 0$. Solving for $R_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ gives:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{F_0}{k}\n$$\nThe continuity of mass, a consequence of finite-rate physical processes, requires that $R(t)$ does not change instantaneously. Therefore, the mass at $t=0$ must be equal to the steady-state mass immediately prior to the change. The initial condition is:\n$$\nR(0) = \\frac{F_0}{k}\n$$\nThe general solution to the non-homogeneous ODE is the sum of the homogeneous solution ($R_h$) and a particular solution ($R_p$). The homogeneous equation $\\frac{dR_h}{dt} + kR_h = 0$ yields $R_h(t) = C \\exp(-kt)$, where $C$ is the constant of integration. For the particular solution, since the right-hand side is a constant $F_1$, we can seek a constant solution $R_p(t) = A$. Substituting into the ODE: $0 + kA = F_1$, which gives $A = \\frac{F_1}{k}$.\nThe full general solution is:\n$$\nR(t) = R_h(t) + R_p(t) = C \\exp(-kt) + \\frac{F_1}{k}\n$$\nNow, we apply the initial condition $R(0) = \\frac{F_0}{k}$ to find $C$:\n$$\nR(0) = C \\exp(-k \\cdot 0) + \\frac{F_1}{k} = C + \\frac{F_1}{k}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{F_0}{k} = C + \\frac{F_1}{k} \\implies C = \\frac{F_0}{k} - \\frac{F_1}{k} = \\frac{F_0 - F_1}{k}\n$$\nSubstituting this value of $C$ back into the general solution gives the specific solution for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$\nR(t) = \\left( \\frac{F_0 - F_1}{k} \\right) \\exp(-kt) + \\frac{F_1}{k}\n$$\nThis can be more compactly written as:\n$$\nR(t) = \\frac{1}{k} \\left( F_1 + (F_0 - F_1)\\exp(-kt) \\right)\n$$\n\n**3. Identification of the e-folding Adjustment Time $\\tau$**\n\nThe e-folding time $\\tau$ describes the characteristic time scale for the system's adjustment to its new equilibrium. It is defined by the decay of the deviation of $R(t)$ from its new steady state. The new steady state, $R_{\\infty}$, is approached as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$\nR_{\\infty} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} R(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{F_1}{k} + \\frac{F_0 - F_1}{k} \\exp(-kt) \\right) = \\frac{F_1}{k}\n$$\nThe deviation from this new steady state is:\n$$\nR(t) - R_{\\infty} = \\left( \\frac{F_1}{k} + \\frac{F_0 - F_1}{k} \\exp(-kt) \\right) - \\frac{F_1}{k} = \\frac{F_0 - F_1}{k} \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis deviation is proportional to an exponential decay term, $\\exp(-kt)$. The problem defines $\\tau$ such that this decay is proportional to $\\exp(-t/\\tau)$. By direct comparison of the exponential factors:\n$$\n\\exp(-kt) = \\exp(-t/\\tau)\n$$\nEquating the arguments of the exponential function, we find:\n$$\nkt = t/\\tau \\implies k = \\frac{1}{\\tau}\n$$\nTherefore, the e-folding adjustment time is the reciprocal of the first-order rate constant:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{1}{k}\n$$\nThis time scale is also known as the residence time or turnover time of the tracer in the reservoir.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{k} \\left( F_{1} + (F_{0} - F_{1})\\exp(-kt) \\right) & \\frac{1}{k}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2495207"}, {"introduction": "Building on the dynamics of a single element, this problem explores how ecological stoichiometry links the cycles of different life-essential elements.

The problem states that biomass produced has a fixed molar elemental stoichiometry given by the coefficients $R_{C}$, $R_{N}$, and $R_{P}$. By definition, the rate of carbon consumption for new biomass, $D_{C}$, is equal to the NPP rate, $G$.\n$$D_{C} = G$$\nThe rates of consumption for nitrogen, $D_{N}$, and phosphorus, $D_{P}$, are determined by the fixed stoichiometric ratios relative to carbon.\n$$D_{N} = G \\cdot \\frac{R_{N}}{R_{C}}$$\n$$D_{P} = G \\cdot \\frac{R_{P}}{R_{C}}$$\nThe problem specifies a steady-state system where the only sources are external supplies ($S_C, S_N, S_P$) and the only sink is assimilation into new biomass at a rate of $100 \\%$. The principle of conservation of mass dictates that the rate of consumption of any element cannot exceed its rate of supply. This establishes a set of inequalities that constrain the possible values of $G$.\n\nFor carbon:\n$$D_{C} \\leq S_{C} \\implies G \\leq S_{C}$$\nFor nitrogen:\n$$D_{N} \\leq S_{N} \\implies G \\frac{R_{N}}{R_{C}} \\leq S_{N} \\implies G \\leq S_{N} \\frac{R_{C}}{R_{N}}$$\nFor phosphorus:\n$$D_{P} \\leq S_{P} \\implies G \\frac{R_{P}}{R_{C}} \\leq S_{P} \\implies G \\leq S_{P} \\frac{R_{C}}{R_{P}}$$\nLiebig’s law of the minimum posits that growth is controlled by the scarcest resource. In this context, the maximum potential NPP, $G_{\\max}$, is determined by the most restrictive of these three upper bounds. Therefore, $G_{\\max}$ is the minimum of the three possible production rates, each calculated assuming one of the elements is fully consumed.\n$$G_{\\max} = \\min \\left( S_{C}, S_{N} \\frac{R_{C}}{R_{N}}, S_{P} \\frac{R_{C}}{R_{P}} \\right)$$\nThis expression represents the general constraint. An equivalent and more symmetric formulation is obtained by rearranging the terms, which highlights the comparison of supply-to-demand ratios. We divide the supply of each element by its stoichiometric requirement, yielding a \"growth potential\" in molar units of phytoplankton \"formula units\". The minimum of these potentials dictates the overall growth, which is then scaled by $R_C$ to express it in carbon units.\n$$G_{\\max} = R_{C} \\cdot \\min \\left( \\frac{S_{C}}{R_{C}}, \\frac{S_{N}}{R_{N}}, \\frac{S_{P}}{R_{P}} \\right)$$\nThis is the final form of the general constraint.\n\nPart 2: Application to the Coastal Scenario\n\nFirst, we calculate the total external supply rates by summing the contributions from Source A and Source B.\nTotal carbon supply: $S_{C} = S_{C}^{A} + S_{C}^{B} = 0.35 + 0.15 = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-2}\\ d^{-1}}$.\nTotal nitrogen supply: $S_{N} = S_{N}^{A} + S_{N}^{B} = 0.018 + 0.007 = 0.025\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-2}\\ d^{-1}}$.\nTotal phosphorus supply: $S_{P} = S_{P}^{A} + S_{P}^{B} = 0.0009 + 0.0003 = 0.0012\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-2}\\ d^{-1}}$.\n\nThe biomass stoichiometry is the Redfield ratio, so $R_{C}=106$, $R_{N}=16$, and $R_{P}=1$.\n\nTo identify the limiting element, we evaluate the terms inside the minimum function from our derived constraint:\nPotential from Carbon: $\\frac{S_{C}}{R_{C}} = \\frac{0.50}{106} \\approx 0.004717\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ units\\ m^{-2}\\ d^{-1}}$\nPotential from Nitrogen: $\\frac{S_{N}}{R_{N}} = \\frac{0.025}{16} = 0.0015625\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ units\\ m^{-2}\\ d^{-1}}$\nPotential from Phosphorus: $\\frac{S_{P}}{R_{P}} = \\frac{0.0012}{1} = 0.0012\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ units\\ m^{-2}\\ d^{-1}}$\n\nComparing these values: $0.0012 < 0.0015625 < 0.004717$. The minimum value corresponds to the supply of phosphorus. Therefore, **phosphorus is the limiting element** for net primary production under these conditions.\n\nNow, we compute the maximum potential NPP, $G_{\\max}$, in molar units.\n$$G_{\\max} = R_{C} \\cdot \\min \\left( \\frac{S_{C}}{R_{C}}, \\frac{S_{N}}{R_{N}}, \\frac{S_{P}}{R_{P}} \\right) = 106 \\cdot 0.0012 = 0.1272\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ C\\ m^{-2}\\ d^{-1}}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer in mass units of carbon per square meter per day ($\\mathrm{g\\ C\\ m^{-2}\\ d^{-1}}$).
