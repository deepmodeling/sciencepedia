Consider the following two systems and use only fundamental thermodynamic relations, ideal solution approximations, and electroneutrality to derive the governing pressures, then compute a comparative magnitude.\n\nSystem 1 (Plant cell): Water is exchanged across a selectively permeable plasma membrane that is permeable to water but not to solutes, enclosed by a mechanically resistant cell wall. Let the chemical potential of water in compartment $i$ be $\\mu_w^{(i)} = \\mu_w^{0}(T) + RT \\ln a_w^{(i)} + V_w P^{(i)}$, where $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is temperature, $a_w^{(i)}$ is the water activity, $V_w$ is the (assumed constant) partial molar volume of water, and $P^{(i)}$ is the hydrostatic pressure. Define the water potential as $\\Psi_w^{(i)} = \\left(\\mu_w^{(i)} - \\mu_w^{0}(T)\\right)/V_w$. Assume dilute, ideal solution behavior so that the osmotic contribution to water activity is governed by the van 't Hoff relation, and neglect gravity and matrix interactions. Starting from water chemical potential equilibrium across the membrane, derive that the intracellular water potential decomposes as $\\Psi_w = \\Psi_s + \\Psi_p$, where the solute potential $\\Psi_s$ is negative and the pressure potential $\\Psi_p$ is the turgor pressure.

We shall first validate the problem statement.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a self-contained set of definitions, assumptions (ideal solutions, van 't Hoff relation, Donnan equilibrium), and numerical constants. The models described are standard, simplified representations in cell biophysics and polymer physics. The task is to apply fundamental thermodynamic principles to derive specific physical quantities.

Therefore, the problem is valid and we proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we analyze System $1$, the plant cell.\nThe chemical potential of water in compartment $i$ is given as $\\mu_w^{(i)} = \\mu_w^{0}(T) + RT \\ln a_w^{(i)} + V_w P^{(i)}$. At equilibrium, the chemical potential of water must be equal inside ($in$) and outside ($out$) the cell membrane:\n$$ \\mu_w^{(\\mathrm{in})} = \\mu_w^{(\\mathrm{out})} $$\nSubstituting the given expression for chemical potential:\n$$ \\mu_w^{0}(T) + RT \\ln a_w^{(\\mathrm{in})} + V_w P^{(\\mathrm{in})} = \\mu_w^{0}(T) + RT \\ln a_w^{(\\mathrm{out})} + V_w P^{(\\mathrm{out})} $$\nThe standard chemical potential term $\\mu_w^{0}(T)$ cancels. Dividing the entire equation by the partial molar volume of water, $V_w$, yields:\n$$ \\frac{RT}{V_w} \\ln a_w^{(\\mathrm{in})} + P^{(\\mathrm{in})} = \\frac{RT}{V_w} \\ln a_w^{(\\mathrm{out})} + P^{(\\mathrm{out})} $$\nThe problem defines the water potential as $\\Psi_w^{(i)} = (\\mu_w^{(i)} - \\mu_w^{0}(T))/V_w$, which, from the original chemical potential equation, is $\\Psi_w^{(i)} = \\frac{RT}{V_w} \\ln a_w^{(i)} + P^{(i)}$. Thus, the equilibrium condition is equivalent to the equality of water potentials:\n$$ \\Psi_w^{(\\mathrm{in})} = \\Psi_w^{(\\mathrm{out})} $$\nThe problem asks to decompose the water potential as $\\Psi_w = \\Psi_s + \\Psi_p$. This is a decomposition by definition. We identify the pressure potential $\\Psi_p$ with the hydrostatic pressure $P$, and the solute potential $\\Psi_s$ with the term reflecting solute concentration, $\\Psi_s = \\frac{RT}{V_w} \\ln a_w$. For a dilute, ideal solution, the van 't Hoff relation connects water activity $a_w$ to the total solute concentration $C$. The activity of water is approximately its mole fraction, $a_w \\approx x_w = 1 - x_s$, where $x_s$ is the total mole fraction of solutes. For dilute solutions, $\\ln a_w \\approx \\ln(1 - x_s) \\approx -x_s$. The solute mole fraction is $x_s \\approx C V_w$. Therefore, $\\ln a_w \\approx -C V_w$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for solute potential gives:\n$$ \\Psi_s = \\frac{RT}{V_w} (-C V_w) = -RT C $$\nThe solute potential is negative, as stated. Using this decomposition, the equilibrium condition $\\Psi_w^{(\\mathrm{in})} = \\Psi_w^{(\\mathrm{out})}$ becomes:\n$$ \\Psi_s^{(\\mathrm{in})} + \\Psi_p^{(\\mathrm{in})} = \\Psi_s^{(\\mathrm{out})} + \\Psi_p^{(\\mathrm{out})} $$\n$$ -RT C_{\\mathrm{in}} + P^{(\\mathrm{in})} = -RT C_{\\mathrm{out}} + P^{(\\mathrm{out})} $$\nThe turgor pressure, $P^{\\ast}$, is the pressure difference across the cell wall, $P^{\\ast} = P^{(\\mathrm{in})} - P^{(\\mathrm{out})}$. Rearranging the equation to solve for this difference, we find:\n$$ P^{\\ast} = P^{(\\mathrm{in})} - P^{(\\mathrm{out})} = RT (C_{\\mathrm{in}} - C_{\\mathrm{out}}) $$\nThis is the final expression for the turgor pressure.\n\nNext, we analyze System $2$, the extracellular matrix gel.\nThis system is governed by Donnan equilibrium. The gel contains fixed negative charges of concentration $C_f$ and is immersed in a reservoir of a monovalent salt of concentration $C_s$. Let the cation be $M^+$ and the anion be $A^-$. In the external reservoir, we have $[M^+]_{\\mathrm{out}} = C_s$ and $[A^-]_{\\mathrm{out}} = C_s$. The total mobile ion concentration outside is $C_{\\mathrm{out}}^{\\mathrm{mobile}} = [M^+]_{\\mathrm{out}} + [A^-]_{\\mathrm{out}} = 2C_s$.\nFor the mobile ions, electrochemical potential equilibrium between the gel ($in$) and the reservoir ($out$) must hold. This leads to the Donnan relation:\n$$ [M^+]_{\\mathrm{in}} [A^-]_{\\mathrm{in}} = [M^+]_{\\mathrm{out}} [A^-]_{\\mathrm{out}} = C_s^2 $$\nInside the gel, the condition of electroneutrality requires that the total positive charge balances the total negative charge:\n$$ [M^+]_{\\mathrm{in}} = [A^-]_{\\mathrm{in}} + C_f $$\nWe solve this system of two equations. Substitute the second equation into the first:\n$$ ([A^-]_{\\mathrm{in}} + C_f) [A^-]_{\\mathrm{in}} = C_s^2 $$\n$$ ([A^-]_{\\mathrm{in}})^2 + C_f [A^-]_{\\mathrm{in}} - C_s^2 = 0 $$\nSolving the quadratic equation for $[A^-]_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and taking the physically meaningful positive root gives:\n$$ [A^-]_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{-C_f + \\sqrt{C_f^2 + 4C_s^2}}{2} $$\nThe concentration of cations inside is then:\n$$ [M^+]_{\\mathrm{in}} = [A^-]_{\\mathrm{in}} + C_f = \\frac{C_f + \\sqrt{C_f^2 + 4C_s^2}}{2} $$\nThe total concentration of mobile ions inside the gel is the sum:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{in}}^{\\mathrm{mobile}} = [M^+]_{\\mathrm{in}} + [A^-]_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\sqrt{C_f^2 + 4C_s^2} $$\nThe osmotic swelling pressure $\\Pi$ is given by the van 't Hoff law for the excess mobile ion concentration:\n$$ \\Pi = RT (C_{\\mathrm{in}}^{\\mathrm{mobile}} - C_{\\mathrm{out}}^{\\mathrm{mobile}}) = RT(\\sqrt{C_f^2 + 4C_s^2} - 2C_s) $$\nThe problem requires the leading-order expression in the dilute limit $C_f \\ll C_s$. We factor out $2C_s$ from the square root:\n$$ \\sqrt{C_f^2 + 4C_s^2} = 2C_s \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{C_f^2}{4C_s^2}} $$\nUsing the Taylor expansion $(1+x)^{1/2} \\approx 1 + \\frac{1}{2}x$ for small $x = \\frac{C_f^2}{4C_s^2}$:\n$$ \\sqrt{C_f^2 + 4C_s^2} \\approx 2C_s \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{C_f^2}{4C_s^2}\\right) = 2C_s + \\frac{C_f^2}{4C_s} $$\nSubstituting this approximation into the expression for $\\Pi$:\n$$ \\Pi \\approx RT \\left( \\left(2C_s + \\frac{C_f^2}{4C_s}\\right) - 2C_s \\right) = RT \\frac{C_f^2}{4C_s} $$\nThis is the leading-order expression for the swelling pressure.\n\nFinally, we compute the dimensionless ratio $r = P^{\\ast}/\\Pi$.\n$$ r = \\frac{P^{\\ast}}{\\Pi} = \\frac{RT (C_{\\mathrm{in}} - C_{\\mathrm{out}})}{RT \\frac{C_f^2}{4C_s}} = \\frac{4C_s (C_{\\mathrm{in}} - C_{\\mathrm{out}})}{C_f^2} $$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values: $C_{\\mathrm{in}} = 0.40 \\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$, $C_{\\mathrm{out}} = 0.10 \\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$, $C_f = 0.10 \\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$, and $C_s = 0.15 \\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$. Note that the temperature $T$ is not required for the ratio.\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{in}} - C_{\\mathrm{out}} = 0.40 - 0.10 = 0.30 \\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1} $$\n$$ C_f^2 = (0.10)^2 = 0.010 \\ (\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1})^2 $$\n$$ 4C_s = 4 \\times 0.15 = 0.60 \\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1} $$\nPlugging these into the expression for $r$:\n$$ r = \\frac{(0.60)(0.30)}{0.010} = \\frac{0.18}{0.010} = 18 $$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

It is based on the fundamental principles of X-ray scattering and geometry. We shall proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the scattering of X-rays by a periodic structure is Bragg's law. For a set of crystallographic planes separated by a distance $d$, constructive interference of scattered waves occurs when the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength $\\lambda$. This condition is expressed as:\n$$n\\lambda = 2d\\sin(\\theta)$$\nwhere $n$ is an integer representing the order of the reflection and $2\\theta$ is the total scattering angle between the incident and scattered beams.\n\nIn small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we typically work with the scattering vector, $\\vec{q}$, whose magnitude $q$ is related to the scattering angle $2\\theta$ and wavelength $\\lambda$ by:\n$$q = |\\vec{q}| = \\frac{4\\pi}{\\lambda}\\sin(\\theta)$$\nThe position of a Bragg peak in reciprocal space is related to the real-space periodicity $d$ by $q = \\frac{2\\pi n}{d}$. For the first-order maximum ($n=1$), this simplifies to $q = \\frac{2\\pi}{d}$. Combining these relations gives back Bragg's law.\n\nFor SAXS, the scattering angles are very small, justifying the small-angle approximation: $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$ and $\\tan(2\\theta) \\approx 2\\theta$. The geometry of the experimental setup relates the radial position $r$ on the detector to the scattering angle $2\\theta$ and the sample-to-detector distance $L$:\n$$\\tan(2\\theta) = \\frac{r}{L}$$\nUsing the small-angle approximation, this becomes:\n$$2\\theta \\approx \\frac{r}{L}$$\nFrom the first-order Bragg condition ($n=1$), $\\lambda = 2d\\sin(\\theta)$.

The orientation of the scattering vector $\\vec{q}$ is perpendicular to the real-space features that produce the scattering.\n\n    *   For the collagen sample, the specified periodicity is the axial $D$-period of $d_{\\text{collagen}} = 67\\,\\text{nm}$. This is a one-dimensional periodicity along the axis of the collagen fibrils. Therefore, in an ideally aligned sample where all fibrils are, for example, oriented vertically, the scattering corresponding to this periodicity will appear along the meridional direction of the 2D scattering pattern, i.e., on the vertical axis.\n    *   For the plant cell wall sample, the periodicity is the center-to-center spacing of cellulose microfibrils, $d_{\\text{cellulose}} = 20\\,\\text{nm}$. This is a lateral packing distance, perpendicular to the long axis of the microfibrils. Therefore, for a sample with vertically aligned microfibrils, the scattering from this lateral packing will appear in the equatorial direction of the 2D scattering pattern, i.e., on the horizontal axis.\n\n    To extract orientation distributions, a 2D SAXS pattern must be recorded for each sample.\n    *   If the fibrils/microfibrils are randomly oriented (isotropic sample), the directional scattering features are averaged over all angles, producing a uniform, circular ring of intensity at radius $r$.\n    *   If there is a preferred orientation (anisotropic sample), the intensity will be concentrated at specific azimuthal angles, $\\phi$, on this ring.\n    *   The orientation can be quantified by plotting the scattered intensity $I$ as a function of the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ around a circle of constant radius $r$ (or constant $q$), yielding an azimuthal profile $I(\\phi)$. For a vertically oriented fibrillar system, the collagen signal would produce peaks at $\\phi = 90^\\circ$ and $\\phi = 270^\\circ$, while the cellulose signal would produce peaks at $\\phi = 0^\\circ$ and $\\phi = 180^\\circ$. The width of these peaks in the $I(\\phi)$ plot is inversely related to the degree of alignment. A narrow, sharp peak indicates high orientation, whereas a broad peak or constant intensity indicates poor orientation or isotropy. From the shape of the $I(\\phi)$ distribution, a quantitative order parameter can be calculated.\n\n2.  **Calculation of Radial Positions**\n\n    We use the derived formula $r \\approx \\frac{\\lambda L}{d}$.

The derivation proceeds from the foundational principles of diffusion in heterogeneous media. The one necessary modeling assumption is that the effects of accessible volume and pathway tortuosity are combined multiplicatively. This is a common and robust starting point in effective medium theory. We thus write:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{eff}} = D_0 \\cdot f_{\\mathrm{volume}} \\cdot f_{\\mathrm{tortuosity}} $$\nwhere $D_0$ is the bulk diffusion coefficient in the pure solvent, $f_{\\mathrm{volume}}$ is the volume fraction accessible to the solute, and $f_{\\mathrm{tortuosity}}$ is a factor accounting for the non-straight nature of the diffusion paths.\n\nFirst, we formalize the accessible volume fraction. The problem states that the bulk water-filled volume fraction, $\\varepsilon$, is reduced by a steric exclusion factor $(1 - a/R)^2$. This gives the accessible porosity, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{acc}}$, which is the fraction of the total volume that the center of mass of the solute can access.\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{acc}} = \\varepsilon \\left(1 - \\frac{a}{R}\\right)^2 $$\nThis term serves as our volume factor, $f_{\\mathrm{volume}} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{acc}}$.

Both are valid.\n\nSecond, we formalize the tortuosity factor. For diffusion along a tortuous path, the effective displacement along a macroscopic axis (let us call it $z$) is reduced. A random walk step of length $ds$ along a local pathway segment oriented at an angle $\\theta$ to the $z$-axis results in a projected displacement of $dz = ds \\cos\\theta$. The mean square displacement along the $z$-axis is related to the mean square displacement along the path by $\\langle dz^2 \\rangle = \\langle ds^2 \\rangle \\langle \\cos^2\\theta \\rangle$.

The significant reduction in the diffusion coefficient in the cell wall is a combined effect of lower porosity, severe steric exclusion due to small pore size, and unfavorable pathway orientation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1772}\n$$", "id": "2599574"}]}
