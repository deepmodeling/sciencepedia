The language is objective and precise. The parameter values are stated as physically plausible, and a cursory check confirms they are within realistic ranges for soil microbial systems.\n\nA critical element is the instruction to \"Treat the reaction as first-order... when justified\". A Monod reaction can be approximated as first-order when the substrate concentration $S$ is much less than the half-saturation constant $K_m$. In this limit, $v = \\frac{V_{\\max} S}{K_m + S} \\approx \\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_m} S = k_1 S$, where $k_1$ is the first-order rate constant.

Since the concentration inside the aggregate, $S(r)$, will always be less than or equal to $S_b$, the condition $S(r) \\ll K_m$ holds reasonably well throughout the aggregate. Therefore, the use of a first-order approximation to derive the effectiveness factor is justified.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is self-contained, scientifically sound, and internally consistent. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is structured according to the two tasks given.\n\nTask 1: Potential nitrification rate without diffusion limitation.\nIn the absence of diffusion limitation, the concentration of the substrate $NH_4^+$ is uniform throughout the microaggregate and equal to the bulk concentration, $S_b$. The specific reaction rate per unit aggregate volume, $v_{\\text{agg}}$, is given by the Monod equation:\n$$\nv_{\\text{agg}} = \\frac{V_{\\max} S_b}{K_m + S_b}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the potential rate per unit *soil* volume, $v_{\\text{soil, pot}}$. This is obtained by multiplying the rate per aggregate volume by the volume fraction of aggregates, $f$.\n$$\nv_{\\text{soil, pot}} = f \\cdot v_{\\text{agg}} = f \\frac{V_{\\max} S_b}{K_m + S_b}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nv_{\\text{soil, pot}} = (0.010) \\frac{(2.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) (0.010\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3})}{(5.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}) + (0.010\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3})}\n$$\n$$\nv_{\\text{soil, pot}} = 0.010 \\times \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^{-8}}{0.060}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^{-10}}{6.00 \\times 10^{-2}}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$v_{\\text{soil, pot}} \\approx 3.333 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. This is the potential rate against which the diffusion-limited rate will be compared.\n\nTask 2: Diffusion limitation analysis and effective rate calculation.\nThe steady-state reaction-diffusion equation in a spherical coordinate system is:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\frac{dS}{dr}\\right) = v_S\n$$\nwhere $v_S$ is the volumetric reaction rate. Using the justified first-order approximation, $v_S = k_1 S$, with $k_1 = V_{\\max}/K_m$.\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\frac{dS}{dr}\\right) = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_m} S\n$$\nThe boundary conditions are $S=S_b$ at $r=R$ and $dS/dr=0$ at $r=0$.\nTo derive the dimensionless group, we introduce dimensionless variables: $\\psi = S/S_b$ and $\\rho = r/R$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\rho^2} \\frac{d}{d\\rho}\\left(\\rho^2 \\frac{d\\psi}{d\\rho}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{R^2 V_{\\max}}{K_m D_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\\right)\\psi\n$$\nThe dimensionless group is the square of the Thiele modulus, $\\phi$. For a first-order reaction in a sphere:\n$$\n\\phi = R \\sqrt{\\frac{k_1}{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}}} = R \\sqrt{\\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_m D_{\\mathrm{eff}}}}\n$$\nThe analytical solution to this differential equation yields the concentration profile, from which the effectiveness factor, $\\eta$, is derived. The effectiveness factor is the ratio of the actual reaction rate to the rate that would occur if the entire aggregate were at the surface concentration $S_b$. For a first-order reaction in a sphere, the expression for $\\eta$ is:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{3}{\\phi^2} (\\phi \\coth(\\phi) - 1)\n$$\nNow we evaluate $\\phi$ to determine the extent of diffusion limitation.\n$$\n\\phi = (5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}) \\sqrt{\\frac{2.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{(5.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3})(1.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1})}}\n$$\n$$\n\\phi = (5.0 \\times 10^{-5}) \\sqrt{\\frac{2.00 \\times 10^{-6}}{5.00 \\times 10^{-11}}} = (5.0 \\times 10^{-5}) \\sqrt{0.4 \\times 10^5} = (5.0 \\times 10^{-5}) \\sqrt{4.00 \\times 10^4}\n$$\n$$\n\\phi = (5.0 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times (2.00 \\times 10^2) = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2} = 0.010\n$$\nSince $\\phi = 0.010 \\ll 1$, the system is strongly reaction-limited, and diffusion limitation is negligible.

All necessary data and parameters are provided, and the problem is free of contradiction or ambiguity.\n\nThe system of ordinary differential equations is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = gNC - mC = f(C, N)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = I - \\ell N - vNC + rmC = h(C, N)\n$$\nA steady state, or equilibrium point, $(C^{\\ast}, N^{\\ast})$ is found by setting the time derivatives to zero: $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dN}{dt} = 0$.\n\nFrom the first equation, for a strictly positive biomass ($C^{\\ast} > 0$):\n$$\nC^{\\ast}(gN^{\\ast} - m) = 0 \\implies gN^{\\ast} - m = 0 \\implies N^{\\ast} = \\frac{m}{g}\n$$\nThe mineral nitrogen concentration at equilibrium is determined by the ratio of the plant mortality rate to the nitrogen-limited growth coefficient.\n\nSubstituting $N^{\\ast} = m/g$ into the second equation at equilibrium:\n$$\nI - \\ell\\left(\\frac{m}{g}\\right) - v\\left(\\frac{m}{g}\\right)C^{\\ast} + rmC^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\nWe solve for $C^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nI - \\frac{\\ell m}{g} = C^{\\ast}\\left(\\frac{vm}{g} - rm\\right) = C^{\\ast}m\\left(\\frac{v}{g} - r\\right)\n$$\n$$\nC^{\\ast} = \\frac{I - \\frac{\\ell m}{g}}{m\\left(\\frac{v}{g} - r\\right)}\n$$\nThe problem provides the following parameter values:\n$g=\\frac{1}{2}$, $m=\\frac{1}{5}$, $v=\\frac{3}{5}$, $\\ell=\\frac{1}{10}$, $r=\\frac{1}{2}$, $I=\\frac{3}{50}$.\n\nWe calculate the numerical values for the equilibrium point $(C^{\\ast}, N^{\\ast})$:\n$$\nN^{\\ast} = \\frac{m}{g} = \\frac{1/5}{1/2} = \\frac{2}{5}\n$$\n$$\nC^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{50} - \\frac{(1/10)(1/5)}{1/2}}{\\frac{1}{5}\\left(\\frac{3/5}{1/2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{50} - \\frac{1/50}{1/2}}{\\frac{1}{5}\\left(\\frac{6}{5} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{50} - \\frac{2}{50}}{\\frac{1}{5}\\left(\\frac{12-5}{10}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{50}}{\\frac{1}{5}\\left(\\frac{7}{10}\\right)} = \\frac{1/50}{7/50} = \\frac{1}{7}\n$$\nThe strictly positive equilibrium is $(C^{\\ast}, N^{\\ast}) = (\\frac{1}{7}, \\frac{2}{5})$.\n\nNext, we perform a local stability analysis by linearizing the system around this equilibrium. This requires the Jacobian matrix $J$:\n$$\nJ(C, N) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial C} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial N} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial C} & \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial N} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} gN - m & gC \\\\ rm - vN & -\\ell - vC \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe evaluate the Jacobian at the equilibrium point $(C^{\\ast}, N^{\\ast})$, denoted as $J^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nJ^{\\ast} = J(C^{\\ast}, N^{\\ast}) = \\begin{pmatrix} gN^{\\ast} - m & gC^{\\ast} \\\\ rm - vN^{\\ast} & -\\ell - vC^{\\ast} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe elements of $J^{\\ast}$ are calculated:\n$J^{\\ast}_{11} = gN^{\\ast} - m = g(\\frac{m}{g}) - m = m - m = 0$.\n$J^{\\ast}_{12} = gC^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{1}{14}$.\n$J^{\\ast}_{21} = rm - vN^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{6}{25} = \\frac{5 - 12}{50} = -\\frac{7}{50}$.\n$J^{\\ast}_{22} = -\\ell - vC^{\\ast} = -\\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = -\\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{3}{35} = \\frac{-7 - 6}{70} = -\\frac{13}{70}$.\n\nThus, the Jacobian matrix at the equilibrium is:\n$$\nJ^{\\ast} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{1}{14} \\\\ -\\frac{7}{50} & -\\frac{13}{70} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $J^{\\ast}$ determine the local stability. They are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(J^{\\ast} - \\lambda I) = 0$, which can be written as $\\lambda^2 - \\text{Tr}(J^{\\ast})\\lambda + \\det(J^{\\ast}) = 0$.\n\nThe trace of $J^{\\ast}$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Tr}(J^{\\ast}) = J^{\\ast}_{11} + J^{\\ast}_{22} = 0 + \\left(-\\frac{13}{70}\\right) = -\\frac{13}{70}\n$$\nThe determinant of $J^{\\ast}$ is:\n$$\n\\det(J^{\\ast}) = J^{\\ast}_{11}J^{\\ast}_{22} - J^{\\ast}_{12}J^{\\ast}_{21} = (0)\\left(-\\frac{13}{70}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{14}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{7}{50}\\right) = \\frac{7}{14 \\cdot 50} = \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 50} = \\frac{1}{100}\n$$\nSince $\\text{Tr}(J^{\\ast}) < 0$ and $\\det(J^{\\ast}) > 0$, the real parts of both eigenvalues must be negative, which confirms that the equilibrium is locally stable.\n\nTo determine if the return to equilibrium is monotonic (overdamped) or oscillatory (underdamped), we examine the discriminant of the characteristic equation, $\\Delta = (\\text{Tr}(J^{\\ast}))^2 - 4\\det(J^{\\ast})$:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\left(-\\frac{13}{70}\\right)^2 - 4\\left(\\frac{1}{100}\\right) = \\frac{169}{4900} - \\frac{4}{100} = \\frac{169}{4900} - \\frac{196}{4900} = -\\frac{27}{4900}\n$$\nSince $\\Delta < 0$, the eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair, which implies that the system exhibits an oscillatory return to equilibrium. The equilibrium is a stable spiral, and the dynamics are underdamped.\n\nThe eigenvalues are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{\\text{Tr}(J^{\\ast}) \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2} = \\frac{-13/70 \\pm \\sqrt{-27/4900}}{2} = \\frac{-13/70 \\pm i\\frac{\\sqrt{27}}{70}}{2}\n$$\nThis gives:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1,2} = -\\frac{13}{140} \\pm i\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{140}\n$$\nThe problem requires computing the real part of the eigenvalues, which quantifies the rate of damping. The real part of both eigenvalues is:\n$$\n\\text{Re}(\\lambda) = -\\frac{13}{140}\n$$\nThis value represents the exponential decay rate of the amplitude of oscillations as the system returns to equilibrium.
