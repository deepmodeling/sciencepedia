This exercise challenges you to do just that by considering the partial loss of cohesin, the molecular glue that holds sister chromatids together [@problem_id:2615907]. By reasoning from this primary defect, you will deduce the subsequent effects on chromosome attachment, checkpoint signaling, and the distinct outcomes of cytokinesis in animal versus plant cells, thereby integrating concepts of mechanical stability and regulatory oversight.", "problem": "A research group uses targeted partial depletion of the mitotic kleisin subunit of cohesin in two systems: a cultured vertebrate epithelial cell line (animals) and Arabidopsis thaliana root meristem cells (plants). In both models, the depletion reduces total cohesin occupancy on chromosomes to approximately $50\\%$ of wild-type, with a disproportionate loss from centromeric regions relative to chromosome arms. Live imaging and fixed-cell assays are used to score anaphase phenotypes and spindle checkpoint behavior. The following observations are made prior to perturbation: in both systems, sister kinetochores normally achieve amphitelic attachment before anaphase, and anaphase onset requires satisfaction of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC), which inhibits the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) until all kinetochores are stably attached to spindle microtubules. It is known that the SAC primarily responds to unattached kinetochores rather than directly to lack of tension, and that merotelic attachments can escape SAC detection. It is also known that vertebrate cytokinesis is completed by an actomyosin contractile ring with an abscission checkpoint that can delay membrane scission in the presence of midbody chromatin, whereas plant cytokinesis proceeds by phragmoplast-guided cell plate insertion across the spindle midzone.\n\nStarting strictly from these core definitions and facts about cohesin-mediated sister chromatid cohesion, kinetochore–microtubule attachment, and SAC logic, predict the comparative anaphase phenotypes and checkpoint responses expected after partial cohesin depletion ($\\approx 50\\%$) in animals versus plants. Which option best captures the most probable outcome regarding: (i) sister chromatid separation defects (e.g., precocious separation versus chromatin bridges), (ii) the prevalence of lagging chromosomes, (iii) SAC activation dynamics (sustained arrest versus transient activation), and (iv) the fate of lagging chromatin during cytokinesis in each system?\n\nA. Animals: Robust, prolonged metaphase arrest due to SAC sensing reduced inter-kinetochore tension; frequent anaphase chromatin bridges from cohesin retention on arms; few lagging chromosomes; cytokinesis often completes without delay. Plants: Similar robust SAC arrest; frequent precocious sister chromatid separation; lagging chromosomes uncommon; cytokinesis outcomes resemble animals.\n\nB. Animals: Partial cohesin depletion increases precocious separation of sister centromeres, making sister kinetochores behave independently and increasing merotelic attachments; SAC is mostly satisfied once attachments are made, so metaphase delay is limited and anaphase shows frequent lagging chromosomes but rare chromatin bridges; abscission can be delayed by the abscission checkpoint if chromatin persists at the midbody. Plants: The same primary defect (reduced centromeric cohesion) elevates lagging chromosomes at anaphase with rare bridges; SAC activation is detectable early but not sustained once attachments form; cytokinesis proceeds via cell plate insertion, which can sever or exclude lagging chromatin, yielding micronuclei.\n\nC. Animals: Partial cohesin depletion prevents separase activation, causing universal failure to cleave cohesin and extensive anaphase chromatin bridges; the SAC is not activated because microtubule attachments are unaffected. Plants: The SAC is absent in plants, so anaphase proceeds normally with no segregation errors despite cohesin depletion.\n\nD. Animals: Cohesin depletion has minimal effects on kinetochore behavior because centrosomes dominate spindle geometry; SAC is fully silenced and anaphase is normal; cytokinesis proceeds without delay. Plants: Because spindles are acentrosomal, loss of cohesin completely abolishes amphitelic attachment, causing permanent SAC arrest and no anaphase onset.\n\nE. Animals: Reduced cohesin at centromeres causes widespread sister–sister co-orientation to a single pole (syntelic attachment), which is efficiently detected and maintains a permanent SAC arrest; when cells slip into anaphase, bridges are common due to unresolved cohesion. Plants: Plant kinetochores are holocentric, so cohesin depletion does not perturb segregation; SAC activation is not observed.\n\nSelect the best option.", "solution": "The validity of the problem statement must first be established.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Experimental Systems**: $1$. Cultured vertebrate epithelial cell line (animals); $2$. *Arabidopsis thaliana* root meristem cells (plants).\n- **Perturbation**: Targeted partial depletion of the mitotic kleisin subunit of cohesin, reducing total cohesin occupancy to approximately $50\\%$ of wild-type.\n- **Distribution of Depletion**: Disproportionate loss of cohesin from centromeric regions relative to chromosome arms.\n- **Baseline Conditions (Both Systems)**: Sister kinetochores normally achieve amphitelic attachment. Anaphase onset requires satisfaction of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC). The SAC inhibits the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) until all kinetochores are stably attached to spindle microtubules.\n- **Established Principles**:\n    $1$. The SAC primarily responds to unattached kinetochores, not directly to lack of tension.\n    $2$. Merotelic attachments (a single kinetochore attached to microtubules from both spindle poles) can escape SAC detection.\n    $3$. Vertebrate cytokinesis occurs via an actomyosin contractile ring and includes an abscission checkpoint that can delay scission in the presence of midbody chromatin.\n    $4$. Plant cytokinesis occurs via phragmoplast-guided cell plate insertion across the spindle midzone.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded. The concepts described—cohesin, sister chromatid cohesion, kinetochores, SAC, APC/C, amphitelic vs. merotelic attachments, and the differing modes of cytokinesis in animals and plants—are all fundamental and accurately portrayed principles of modern cell biology. The experimental setup (partial depletion of a key protein) is a standard method in biological research. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient information to deduce a logical outcome based on the \"rules\" provided. It is objective and free of non-scientific claims. There are no internal contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe problem requires a prediction of phenotypes resulting from the partial depletion of cohesin, with a specific emphasis on the disproportionate loss at centromeres.\n\n$1$. **Primary Molecular Defect and its Immediate Consequence**: Cohesin's function is to hold sister chromatids together. The centromeric cohesin is particularly critical for resisting the pulling forces of the spindle microtubules and ensuring that the two sister kinetochores function as a single unit, facilitating their attachment to opposite poles (amphitelic attachment). A reduction of cohesin to $\\approx 50\\%$, with disproportionate loss at the centromere, severely weakens this connection. The two sister kinetochores can now behave more independently during their interaction with the spindle. This geometric instability and loss of back-to-back constraint significantly increases the probability of improper kinetochore-microtubule attachments, most notably **merotelic attachment**, where a single kinetochore is captured by microtubules emanating from both spindle poles. It also increases the likelihood of **precocious sister chromatid separation**, where the pulling forces completely sever the weakened centromeric connection before anaphase onset.\n\n$2$. **Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) Response**: A critical premise given is that the SAC responds primarily to **unattached kinetochores**, not the lack of tension, and that **merotelic attachments can escape SAC detection**. In a merotelic attachment, the kinetochore is, by definition, attached to microtubules. Therefore, the biochemical signal for the SAC is satisfied, and the checkpoint is silenced. The cell does not register this as an error. If precocious separation occurs, the two individual chromatids will eventually form stable attachments and also satisfy the SAC. Consequently, a robust, prolonged metaphase arrest is not the expected outcome. Instead, the SAC will be satisfied once all kinetochores have captured microtubules, even if some of these attachments are erroneous. This leads to a limited, if any, metaphase delay before the cell proceeds into anaphase.\n\n$3$. **Anaphase Phenotypes**: Upon SAC satisfaction, the APC/C is activated, leading to separase activation and cleavage of the remaining cohesin on the chromosome arms.\n    - **Lagging Chromosomes**: A merotelically attached chromatid is pulled simultaneously toward opposite poles. It cannot segregate correctly and is left behind at the spindle midzone as the other chromosomes move to the poles. Therefore, a high frequency of **lagging chromosomes** is the direct and most probable consequence of the primary attachment defect.\n    - **Chromatin Bridges**: These are structures that connect separating chromatid masses during anaphase, typically due to failure to resolve DNA catenations or incomplete cleavage of arm cohesin. While some cohesin remains on the arms, the primary defect described is at the centromere, leading to attachment errors. The satisfaction of the SAC implies normal activation of separase, which should cleave arm cohesin. Thus, widespread chromatin bridges are not the expected primary phenotype; lagging chromosomes resulting from merotely are.\n\n$4$. **Comparative Cytokinesis Fates**:\n    - **Animal Cells**: A lagging chromosome becomes trapped in the cleavage furrow at the spindle midbody. The problem states that the **abscission checkpoint** can delay the final membrane scission in the presence of such midbody chromatin. This is a mechanism to prevent DNA damage and aneuploidy, often resulting in a prolonged cytokinesis or outright failure, which can lead to a single tetraploid cell.\n    - **Plant Cells**: Cytokinesis proceeds via the formation of a rigid cell plate, guided by the phragmoplast. This structure grows from the center outwards. A lagging chromosome in the path of the growing cell plate cannot trigger a delay mechanism analogous to the abscission checkpoint. Instead, the advancing cell plate is likely to either **sever (\"guillotine\") the chromosome**, causing catastrophic DNA damage, or physically **exclude it from either daughter nucleus**, resulting in its encapsulation within a small, separate nuclear envelope to form a **micronucleus**.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation**: In both systems, reduced centromeric cohesion leads to merotelic attachments, SAC bypass, and consequent lagging chromosomes in anaphase. The fates of these lagging chromosomes differ due to the distinct mechanisms of cytokinesis: delayed abscission in animals versus cell plate-mediated severing or exclusion in plants.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A**: This option is incorrect. It wrongly posits that the SAC senses tension, leading to a robust arrest. The problem statement explicitly contradicts this. It also incorrectly predicts frequent bridges and few lagging chromosomes, which is the reverse of the expected outcome from merotely.\n\n**B**: This option correctly describes the entire causal chain. It correctly identifies that partial cohesin depletion leads to precocious separation and increased merotelic attachments. It correctly states the SAC is mostly satisfied, leading to limited delay and anaphase onset. It correctly predicts frequent lagging chromosomes and rare bridges. Crucially, it accurately distinguishes the subsequent events in cytokinesis: delay of abscission in animals due to the abscission checkpoint, and severing/exclusion of chromatin by the cell plate in plants leading to micronuclei. This aligns perfectly with the derivation.\n\n**C**: This option is incorrect. It makes the unfounded claim that cohesin depletion prevents separase activation. It also makes the factually incorrect claim that the SAC is absent in plants. *Arabidopsis* has a functional SAC.\n\n**D**: This option is incorrect. It wrongly minimizes the effect of cohesin depletion in animal cells and presents a false dichotomy based on the presence or absence of centrosomes. Cohesin is indispensable for bi-orientation in both systems. Its prediction of a \"permanent SAC arrest\" in plants is also inconsistent with the known escape of merotelic attachments from checkpoint surveillance.\n\n**E**: This option is incorrect. It incorrectly states that *Arabidopsis thaliana* (a dicot plant) has holocentric kinetochores; it has monocentric chromosomes like vertebrates. This completely invalidates its reasoning for the plant system. While it mentions syntelic attachment, it fails to account for the more likely SAC-bypassing merotelic attachments.\n\nTherefore, option B is the only one that is consistent with the provided biological principles and accurately predicts the comparative outcomes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2615907"}, {"introduction": "Beyond mechanical integrity, the cell cycle is governed by a precise biochemical clock that ensures events occur in the correct order. This problem focuses on the critical 'off' switch for mitosis: the degradation of Cyclin B, which leads to the inactivation of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (CDK) activity [@problem_id:2615989]. You will predict the phenotype that results from keeping this mitotic kinase artificially active, a classic thought experiment that reveals the non-negotiable requirement for CDK inactivation to permit mitotic exit and cytokinesis.", "problem": "A central organizing principle of eukaryotic cell-cycle control is that cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity is periodically raised and lowered to gate state transitions: high cyclin B–CDK activity is necessary to enter and maintain mitosis, while a sharp decline in this kinase activity is necessary for mitotic exit and the onset and completion of cytokinesis. This decline is normally driven by the ubiquitin ligase Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), which targets both securin and cyclin B for proteasomal degradation, thereby enabling separase activation for sister-chromatid disjunction and permitting phosphatases such as protein phosphatase $1$ (PP$1$) and protein phosphatase $2$A (PP$2$A) to reverse mitotic phosphorylations. Cytokinesis requires distinct structures and regulations in animals versus plants: animal cells utilize an actomyosin contractile ring under RhoA control and complete abscission via Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT), whereas plant cells build a new cell plate from a microtubule- and actin-rich phragmoplast guided to the division plane.\n\nYou ectopically express a cyclin B variant lacking a canonical destruction box (D-box), rendering it refractory to APC/C-dependent proteolysis (“nondegradable cyclin B”), in two systems: a cultured animal epithelial cell line and a plant root meristem.

High cyclin B–CDK activity is necessary to enter and maintain mitosis.\n2.  A sharp decline in cyclin B–CDK activity is necessary for mitotic exit, and for the onset and completion of cytokinesis.\n3.  This decline is normally driven by the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), which targets securin and cyclin B for proteasomal degradation.\n4.  Securin degradation activates separase, leading to sister-chromatid disjunction.\n5.  Cyclin B degradation allows phosphatases, such as protein phosphatase $1$ (PP$1$) and protein phosphatase $2$A (PP$2$A), to reverse mitotic phosphorylations.\n6.  Animal cell cytokinesis involves an actomyosin contractile ring under RhoA control and abscission via the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT).\n7.  Plant cell cytokinesis involves building a cell plate from a phragmoplast.\n8.

Experimental systems: A cultured animal epithelial cell line and a plant root meristem.\n10. Timing of expression: The nondegradable cyclin B is present from the metaphase–anaphase transition onward.\n11. Control observation: Endogenous securin is still degraded upon APC/C activation.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The statement is based on fundamental, universally accepted principles of eukaryotic cell cycle regulation. The roles of cyclin B-CDK, APC/C, securin, separase, and the general mechanics of cytokinesis in animals and plants are described accurately. The experimental design, using a nondegradable cyclin B mutant, is a classic and powerful tool in cell cycle research.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined. The initial conditions (nondegradable cyclin B present after metaphase begins, securin degradation proceeds normally) are specified, and the question asks for a predictable outcome based on these conditions. A unique solution can be derived from the provided principles.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Consistency and Completeness:** The setup is internally consistent. The crucial piece of information that securin is still degraded is provided, which prevents ambiguity about the activity state of the APC/C. This allows for a logical deduction of downstream events. The problem is self-contained and does not require external information beyond the stated principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-formulated question in cellular and molecular biology. The solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe experimental setup uncouples the two major functions of the APC/C at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition.\n\n1.  **APC/C Activation and Sister Chromatid Segregation:** The problem states that endogenous securin is degraded. Securin is a substrate of the APC/C. Its degradation implies that the APC/C is activated at the metaphase-anaphase transition, as it should be once the spindle assembly checkpoint is satisfied. The degradation of securin liberates the protease separase. Active separase cleaves the cohesin complexes that hold sister chromatids together. Consequently, sister chromatids will separate and move to opposite spindle poles. This means the cells, both animal and plant, will successfully enter anaphase.\n\n2.  **Consequences of Persistently High Cyclin B–CDK Activity:** The problem states that a nondegradable variant of cyclin B is expressed. This means that even though APC/C is active, cyclin B levels will not fall. Because cyclin B is the regulatory subunit of the primary mitotic kinase, CDK1, its persistence maintains high CDK1 activity. The problem explicitly states that a *decline* in this kinase activity is necessary for mitotic exit and cytokinesis. Therefore, the failure to degrade cyclin B will have two major consequences:\n\n    a. **Failure of Mitotic Exit:** Mitotic exit comprises a series of events that reverse the prophase/prometaphase transitions, including chromosome decondensation and nuclear envelope reassembly. These events are driven by the dephosphorylation of CDK substrates by phosphatases like PP$1$ and PP$2$A. High CDK activity antagonizes these phosphatases, keeping the substrates in their phosphorylated, mitotic state. As a result, chromosomes will remain condensed, and the nuclear envelope will fail to re-form around the segregated chromatids. The cells in both systems will be arrested in a late-mitotic state (anaphase/telophase).\n\n    b. **Failure of Cytokinesis:** The problem states that a decline in CDK activity is necessary for the *onset and completion* of cytokinesis. High CDK activity is known to be inhibitory to the key steps of cytokinesis in both animals and plants.\n    - In **animal cells**, high CDK activity inhibits the full activation of the RhoA pathway and the stable assembly and constriction of the actomyosin contractile ring. While some initial membrane furrowing might be observed, it is typically unstable and regresses. The final step, abscission, which involves the ESCRT machinery, is also robustly blocked by high CDK activity.\n    - In **plant cells**, cytokinesis depends on the formation, expansion, and maturation of the cell plate from the phragmoplast. This process is also negatively regulated by high CDK activity. The initiation of the phragmoplast may occur at the cell equator, but its expansion towards the cell periphery and fusion with the mother cell wall are blocked. This results in the formation of incomplete, rudimentary cell plate structures, often referred to as \"cell plate stubs.\"\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation:**\nBased on these first principles, the expected phenotype in both animal and plant cells is:\n- Successful entry into anaphase with sister chromatid separation.\n- Arrest in a late-mitotic state due to failure of mitotic exit, characterized by condensed chromosomes and no nuclear envelope reassembly.\n- Failure to complete cytokinesis, resulting in a regressing furrow in animal cells and an abortive cell plate in plant cells.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Animal cells fail to satisfy the spindle assembly checkpoint and stall in prometaphase with no cleavage furrow; plant root meristem cells complete cell plate formation because plant cytokinesis is independent of mitotic exit.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. First, the problem implies the spindle assembly checkpoint is satisfied because securin degradation (an event downstream of checkpoint satisfaction) occurs. Thus, the arrest is not in prometaphase, but later. Second, the claim that plant cytokinesis is independent of mitotic exit (i.e., independent of CDK inactivation) is factually incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Animal cells enter anaphase but do not complete telophase or cytokinesis; transient cleavage furrow ingression may occur but regresses, with chromosomes remaining condensed and the nuclear envelope unreformed; plant root meristem cells likewise separate sister chromatids but exhibit initiation of a phragmoplast that stalls, producing abortive cell plate “stubs” and failure of nuclear reassembly and chromatin decondensation.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with our derivation. It correctly predicts:\n- Entry into anaphase (sister chromatid separation) in both systems.\n- Failure of telophase events (nuclear reassembly, chromatin decondensation) due to persistent high CDK activity in both systems.\n- Failure of cytokinesis, with specific and accurate descriptions of the resulting phenotypes: a transient/regressing furrow in the animal cell and abortive cell plate \"stubs\" from a stalled phragmoplast in the plant cell.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Animal cells complete cytokinesis and abscission but remain in mitosis with condensed chromosomes; plant root meristem cells complete phragmoplast expansion and cell plate fusion but cannot decondense chromatin, yielding cells that are physically separated yet remain mitotic.**\nThis option incorrectly claims that cytokinesis can be completed in the presence of high CDK activity. This directly contradicts a central premise given in the problem statement (\"a sharp decline in this kinase activity is necessary for ... completion of cytokinesis\").\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Animal cells skip cytokinesis and undergo mitotic slippage into the next interphase, becoming binucleate because cyclin B is stabilized; plant root meristem cells switch to endoreduplication, forming polyploid cells as cytokinesis proceeds normally but mitosis is bypassed.**\nThis option contains multiple inaccuracies. \"Mitotic slippage\" is a potential long-term fate of a cell arrested in mitosis, not the immediate phenotype, which is the arrest itself. Furthermore, slippage typically results in a single tetraploid ($4n$) nucleus, not a binucleate state. The description for plant cells is also incorrect; cytokinesis does not proceed normally, and the cell is arrested *in* mitosis, not bypassing it to switch to endoreduplication.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2615989"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the qualitative consequences of breaking the cell cycle machinery, we now turn to the quantitative engine that drives its operation.

The model is a simplified, yet canonical, representation of the mitotic oscillator, a core mechanism of the cell cycle. The tasks are specified with objective, quantitative criteria, and all necessary parameters and initial conditions are provided. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness. Therefore, a rigorous solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem is partitioned into two distinct tasks: first, the analysis of a three-variable dynamical system for self-sustained oscillations, and second, the analysis of a reduced one-variable system for bistability.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of the Full Mitotic Oscillator**\n\nThe dynamics of the full oscillator are described by a system of three coupled, nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the concentrations of cyclin B ($C$), active CDK1 ($X$), and active APC/C ($A$):\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{dC}{dt} &= k_s - k_{\\mathrm{deg}}\\,A\\,C \\\\\n\\frac{dX}{dt} &= k_c\\,C\\,(1 - X) + k_{\\mathrm{aut1}}\\,X\\,(1 - X) + k_{\\mathrm{aut2}}\\,X^2\\,(1 - X) - \\bigl(k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{ax}}\\,A\\bigr) X \\\\\n\\frac{dA}{dt} &= k_a\\,X^2\\,(1 - A) - k_i\\,A\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nTo determine if the system exhibits oscillations for a given parameter set, we must numerically integrate these equations over a specified time interval, $t \\in [0, 400]$, starting from the initial condition $(C(0), X(0), A(0)) = (0.0, 0.01, 0.0)$. A robust numerical integration scheme, such as an adaptive step-size Runge-Kutta method or a method suitable for stiff systems like `LSODA`, as implemented in the `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` function, is appropriate.\n\nThe analysis of the resulting time series for $C(t)$ and $X(t)$ must be performed on the latter part of the trajectory to ensure that any observed behavior is a sustained limit cycle and not a transient response to the initial conditions. As specified, the first $60\\%$ of the sampled data, corresponding to the time interval $t \\in [0, 240]$, will be discarded.\n\nOscillations are detected if two conditions are met in the analysis window ($t \\in [240, 400]$):\n$1$. The amplitude of oscillation, defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values of a state variable (e.g., $X(t)$), must exceed a minimum threshold: $\\max(X) - \\min(X) > \\Delta_{\\mathrm{min}}$, where $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{min}} = 0.05$.\n$2$. There must be at least $3$ local maxima in the time series. The peaks must be significant, determined by a prominence threshold of $\\delta_{\\mathrm{peak}} = 10^{-3}$. We will use the `scipy.signal.find_peaks` function for this purpose.\n\nThe final output for each oscillator case is a boolean value: `True` if both conditions are met, and `False` otherwise.\n\n**Part 2: Bistability Analysis of the Reduced CDK Activation Module**\n\nTo analyze the bistability of the CDK1 activation switch, we consider a simplified one-dimensional system where cyclin concentration is held constant, $C = C_{\\mathrm{fix}}$, and the feedback from APC/C onto CDK1 is ignored ($k_{\\mathrm{ax}} = 0$). The dynamics of the active CDK1 fraction, $X$, are then governed by:\n$$\n\\frac{dX}{dt} = f(X) = k_c\\,C_{\\mathrm{fix}}\\,(1 - X) + k_{\\mathrm{aut1}}\\,X\\,(1 - X) + k_{\\mathrm{aut2}}\\,X^2\\,(1 - X) - k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,X\n$$\nThe steady states, or equilibria ($X^\\ast$), of this system are the roots of the equation $f(X) = 0$. Expanding the expression for $f(X)$ reveals it is a cubic polynomial:\n$$\nf(X) = a_3 X^3 + a_2 X^2 + a_1 X + a_0 = 0\n$$\nwhere the coefficients are functions of the system parameters:\n$$\na_3 = -k_{\\mathrm{aut2}},\\quad\na_2 = k_{\\mathrm{aut2}} - k_{\\mathrm{aut1}},\\quad\na_1 = k_{\\mathrm{aut1}} - k_{\\mathrm{off}} - k_c\\,C_{\\mathrm{fix}},\\quad\na_0 = k_c\\,C_{\\mathrm{fix}}\n$$\nBistability exists if the system has two or more stable equilibria within the physically meaningful interval $X \\in [0,1]$. The stability of an equilibrium $X^\\ast$ is determined by the sign of the derivative of $f(X)$ evaluated at that point, $f'(X^\\ast)$. An equilibrium is linearly stable if $f'(X^\\ast) < 0$ and unstable if $f'(X^\\ast) > 0$. The derivative is a quadratic polynomial:\n$$\nf'(X) = 3 a_3 X^2 + 2 a_2 X + a_1\n$$\nThe procedure for the bistability analysis is as follows:\n$1$. For each parameter set, calculate the coefficients $a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0$.\n$2$. Find the roots of the cubic polynomial $f(X)=0$. A standard numerical method, such as `numpy.roots`, will be employed.\n$3$. Filter the roots to retain only those that are real and lie within the domain $[0,1]$. A small numerical tolerance should be used to account for floating-point inaccuracies when checking if a root is real.\n$4$. For each valid root $X^\\ast$, evaluate $f'(X^\\ast)$.\n$5$. Count the number of valid roots for which $f'(X^\\ast) < 0$. This count is the number of stable equilibria in the specified domain.\n\nThis methodology will be implemented for all four specified test cases, and the results will be aggregated into the required output format.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\nfrom scipy.signal import find_peaks\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the four test cases for the mitotic oscillator problem.\n    Cases 1 & 2: Analyze the full 3-variable system for oscillations.\n    Cases 3 & 4: Analyze the reduced 1-variable system for bistability.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def analyze_oscillator(params, y0, t_span, t_eval):\n        \"\"\"\n        Integrates the full oscillator ODE system and checks for oscillations.\n        \"\"\"\n        \n        def ode_system(t, y, k_s, k_deg, k_c, k_aut1, k_aut2, k_off, k_ax, k_a, k_i):\n            \"\"\"Defines the 3-variable ODE system.\"\"\"\n            C, X, A = y\n            dCdt = k_s -
