It is based on fundamental principles of meiosis, including diploidy, haploidy, independent assortment, and crossing over. The premises are internally consistent and provide sufficient information for a unique solution. The definition of a \"gamete type\" is precise and unambiguous, being restricted to the identity of the centromeres, which is a critical constraint. The scenario described is a standard conceptual problem in genetics. There are no violations of scientific principles, logical inconsistencies, or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be formulated.\n\n**Solution Formulation**\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the number of unique gamete types based on a specific definition. The organism is diploid with a chromosome number of $2n=14$. This implies that the haploid number, representing the number of homologous chromosome pairs, is $n = \\frac{14}{2} = 7$.\n\nA gamete is haploid, meaning it contains one chromosome from each of the $n=7$ homologous pairs. The principle of independent assortment dictates that the segregation of one homologous pair into gametes is an independent event with respect to all other homologous pairs.\n\nFor each of the $n=7$ pairs, a gamete will inherit a chromosome with either a maternal-origin centromere or a paternal-origin centromere. There are precisely two possibilities for each chromosome pair. Since the assortment is independent across all $7$ pairs, the total number of distinct combinations of centromeres in a gamete is the product of the number of possibilities for each pair.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of distinct gamete types. For $n$ independently assorting chromosome pairs, where each pair has $2$ possible origins (maternal or paternal), the total number of combinations is given by the formula:\n$$N = 2^n$$\nSubstituting the given value of $n=7$:\n$$N = 2^7 = 128$$\nThis calculation is performed under the initial condition of no crossing over.\n\nThe second part of the problem introduces the condition of an obligate chiasma per bivalent, which means at least one crossover event occurs for each homologous pair during prophase I of meiosis. We must evaluate if this condition alters the number of distinct gamete types as defined.\n\nThe definition of a gamete type is crucial: it is based *solely* on the combination of maternal versus paternal centromere-marker states. A crossover event involves the physical exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids of a homologous pair. This exchange occurs on the chromosome arms, distal to the centromere. The centromere itself is a specific locus and is not exchanged during recombination. Thus, after a crossover event, a chromatid that originally had a maternal centromere still possesses a maternal centromere, even if its arm now contains a segment of paternal DNA. Likewise, a chromatid with a paternal centromere retains its paternal centromere.\n\nDuring anaphase I, homologous chromosomes—each consisting of two chromatids joined at the centromere—are segregated. Critically, the homologous *centromeres* are separated. One secondary meiocyte receives a chromosome with a maternal-origin centromere, and the other receives the chromosome with a paternal-origin centromere, for each of the $n=7$ chromosome types. This is true regardless of whether the chromatids are recombinant or non-recombinant.\n\nDuring anaphase II, sister chromatids separate. The centromeres of sister chromatids are identical in origin (both maternal or both paternal). Therefore, segregation at meiosis II does not alter the maternal or paternal origin of the centromere that ultimately resides in the gamete.\n\nBecause the identity of a gamete type is defined strictly by the origin of its centromeres, and crossing over does not alter the origin of centromeres, the introduction of an obligate chiasma has no effect on the number of distinct gamete types so defined. The process generating the diversity of centromere combinations is the independent assortment of homologous chromosomes at meiosis I, which remains the same. The number of possible outcomes for the combination of centromeres is still governed by the expression $2^n$.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct gamete types, as defined by the problem, is unchanged by the presence of crossing over. The number remains $2^7$.\n$$N = 2^7 = 128$$\nWhile crossing over vastly increases the total genetic variation by creating new combinations of alleles along the chromosome, it does not alter the number of combinations of centromere origins. The question, by its precise definition of a \"gamete type,\" isolates the effect of independent assortment from the effect of recombination. The final answer is the integer value for the number of these types.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{128}$$", "id": "2589225"}, {"introduction": "While independent assortment shuffles entire chromosomes, crossing over generates further novelty by exchanging segments between homologous chromosomes, thereby creating new combinations of alleles. This exercise [@problem_id:2589222] provides a practical opportunity to engage with the classic methodology of the three-point testcross, a powerful tool for quantifying recombination. By analyzing hypothetical progeny data, you will infer gene order and calculate recombination frequencies, fundamental skills that bridge classical genetics with modern genomics.", "problem": "A research group studying conserved features of meiosis across angiosperms and insects uses three-point testcross logic to quantify recombination and interference. In a flowering plant, a triple heterozygote with phase $ABC/abc$ is testcrossed to a triple recessive $abc/abc$. Under the standard assumptions for a three-point testcross in eukaryotes—namely, that each scored progeny reflects a single meiotic product, that there is no chromatid interference, and that the most frequent classes are nonrecombinants—progeny are classified into eight genotypic classes corresponding to chromatids recovered.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Mendelian and molecular genetics, specifically gene mapping via testcross analysis. All necessary data are provided, and they are internally consistent (the sum of individual progeny counts is $815+815+114+114+66+66+5+5 = 2000$, which matches the specified total sample size). The problem is well-posed, objective, and requires application of standard, formalizable genetic logic. There are no logical contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe solution proceeds by executing the four tasks specified in the problem statement.\n\n**1. Inference of Gene Order**\n\nThe gene order is inferred by identifying the parental (non-recombinant, NCO) and double-crossover (DCO) classes from the progeny counts.\n-   The parental classes are the most frequent. From the data, these are $ABC$ (count of $815$) and $abc$ (count of $815$). This confirms the parental linkage phase is $ABC/abc$. The total number of non-recombinant progeny is $N_{NCO} = 815 + 815 = 1630$.\n-   The double-crossover (DCO) classes are the least frequent. These are $AbC$ (count of $5$) and $aBc$ (count of $5$). The total number of DCO progeny is $N_{DCO} = 5 + 5 = 10$.\n-   To determine the middle gene, we compare a parental genotype with a DCO genotype. For example, comparing the parental genotype $ABC$ with the DCO genotype $AbC$, the alleles for genes $A$ and $C$ are the same ($A$ and $C$), while the allele for gene $B$ is different ($B$ vs $b$). The gene whose allele is switched relative to the flanking markers is the gene in the middle. Therefore, the gene order is $A-B-C$.\n\n**2. Computation of Recombination Fractions**\n\nWith the gene order established as $A-B-C$, the remaining progeny classes must be single crossovers (SCO).\n-   Single crossovers in Interval $1$ (between gene $A$ and gene $B$) would produce the genotypes $Abc$ and $aBC$. The counts for these classes are $114$ and $114$, respectively. The total number of SCO progeny in Interval $1$ is $N_{SCO1} = 114 + 114 = 228$.\n-   Single crossovers in Interval $2$ (between gene $B$ and gene $C$) would produce the genotypes $ABc$ and $abC$. The counts for these classes are $66$ and $66$, respectively. The total number of SCO progeny in Interval $2$ is $N_{SCO2} = 66 + 66 = 132$.\n-   A consistency check confirms the total progeny: $N = N_{NCO} + N_{SCO1} + N_{SCO2} + N_{DCO} = 1630 + 228 + 132 + 10 = 2000$.\n\nThe recombination fraction ($RF$) for an interval is the frequency of all recombinant events (both SCO and DCO) occurring within that interval.\n-   The recombination fraction for Interval $1$ ($RF_{A-B}$) is:\n$$RF_{A-B} = \\frac{N_{SCO1} + N_{DCO}}{N} = \\frac{228 + 10}{2000} = \\frac{238}{2000} = 0.119$$\n-   The recombination fraction for Interval $2$ ($RF_{B-C}$) is:\n$$RF_{B-C} = \\frac{N_{SCO2} + N_{DCO}}{N} = \\frac{132 + 10}{2000} = \\frac{142}{2000} = 0.071$$\n\n**3. Derivation of Expected Double-Crossover Frequency**\n\nAssuming no interference, the formation of a crossover in one interval is independent of the formation of a crossover in the adjacent interval. Therefore, the expected frequency of double crossovers ($DCO_{exp}$) is the product of the recombination frequencies of the two intervals.\n$$DCO_{exp} = RF_{A-B} \\times RF_{B-C}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$DCO_{exp} = 0.119 \\times 0.071 = 0.008449$$\nThe problem requires this answer as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.008449$ already has exactly four significant figures ($8, 4, 4, 9$). Thus, no further rounding is required.\n\n**4. Computation of Coefficient of Coincidence and Interference**\n\nFor completeness, we compute the coefficient of coincidence ($C$) and interference ($I$).\n-   The observed double-crossover frequency ($DCO_{obs}$) is:\n$$DCO_{obs} = \\frac{N_{DCO}}{N} = \\frac{10}{2000} = 0.005$$\n-   The coefficient of coincidence is the ratio of observed to expected DCO frequencies:\n$$C = \\frac{DCO_{obs}}{DCO_{exp}} = \\frac{0.005}{0.008449} \\approx 0.591786$$\n-   Interference is defined as $I = 1 - C$:\n$$I = 1 - 0.591786 = 0.408214$$\nThe positive interference value ($I \\approx 0.41$) indicates that a crossover in one region reduces the probability of a second crossover nearby, which is a common biological observation.\n\nThe final answer required is the expected double-crossover frequency from part $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.008449}$$", "id": "2589222"}, {"introduction": "The remarkable precision of meiosis is essential for producing viable, euploid gametes, but the process is not infallible.

No numerical approximation is required, and no units are needed.", "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, describing a canonical scenario of meiotic nondisjunction. We shall proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nLet the diploid organism have a chromosome number of $2n$, consisting of $n$ homologous pairs. Before the onset of meiosis, each of the $2n$ chromosomes replicates, so the cell entering meiosis I contains $2n$ chromosomes, each composed of two sister chromatids. These chromosomes pair up to form $n$ bivalents.\n\nThe problem specifies two key events:\n$1$. Exactly one bivalent undergoes nondisjunction during meiosis I (MI). This means that instead of separating, both homologous chromosomes of this single pair migrate to the same pole during anaphase I.\n$2$. The remaining $n-1$ bivalents segregate normally. This means for each of these pairs, the homologous chromosomes separate and migrate to opposite poles.\n$3$. Meiosis II (MII), the separation of sister chromatids, proceeds normally for all chromosomes in both daughter cells from MI.\n\nLet us trace the chromosome content through the two meiotic divisions.\n\nDuring Meiosis I:\nThe $n-1$ normally segregating bivalents will distribute one homologous chromosome (each replicated) to each of the two forming daughter cells.\nThe single bivalent undergoing nondisjunction will send both of its homologous chromosomes (both replicated) to one daughter cell, and none to the other.\n\nAs a result of telophase I and cytokinesis, two secondary meiocytes are formed with unequal chromosome numbers:\n- **Secondary Meiocyte 1**: This cell receives one chromosome from each of the $n-1$ normally segregating pairs, plus both homologous chromosomes from the nondisjoining pair. The total number of chromosomes in this cell is $(n-1) + 2 = n+1$. Each of these $n+1$ chromosomes is still in its replicated state (composed of two sister chromatids).\n- **Secondary Meiocyte 2**: This cell receives one chromosome from each of the $n-1$ normally segregating pairs, but zero chromosomes from the nondisjoining pair. The total number of chromosomes in this cell is $(n-1) + 0 = n-1$. Each of these $n-1$ chromosomes is also in its replicated state.\n\nDuring Meiosis II:\nThe problem states that MII proceeds normally. In MII, sister chromatids separate.\n\n- The division of **Secondary Meiocyte 1** (containing $n+1$ chromosomes) will produce two daughter cells, which are the final gametes. Since sister chromatid separation is normal, each of the $n+1$ chromosomes will yield one chromatid to each gamete. Thus, both gametes produced from this cell will have a chromosome count of $n+1$. These are referred to as $(n+1)$ or disomic gametes (disomic for the chromosome that underwent nondisjunction).\n- The division of **Secondary Meiocyte 2** (containing $n-1$ chromosomes) will also produce two gametes. Normal separation of sister chromatids means that each of the $n-1$ chromosomes will contribute one chromatid to each gamete. Thus, both gametes produced from this cell will have a chromosome count of $n-1$. These are referred to as $(n-1)$ or nullisomic gametes (nullisomic for the chromosome that underwent nondisjunction).\n\nIn summary, the four meiotic products (gametes) resulting from this single meiotic event are:\n- Two gametes with chromosome count $n+1$.\n- Two gametes with chromosome count $n-1$.\n\nThe problem defines an aneuploid gamete as one whose chromosome count deviates from the normal haploid number, $n$.\n- A gamete with count $n+1$ is aneuploid because $n+1 \\neq n$.\n- A gamete with count $n-1$ is aneuploid because $n-1 \\neq n$ (for any biologically relevant case where $n \\ge 1$).\n\nTherefore, all four gametes produced under these specific conditions are aneuploid.\n\nThe expected frequency of aneuploid gametes among the four products is the ratio of the number of aneuploid gametes to the total number of gametes.\nNumber of aneuploid gametes $= 2 (\\text{from } n+1) + 2 (\\text{from } n-1) = 4$.\nTotal number of gametes produced $= 4$.\n\nThe frequency is $\\frac{4}{4} = 1$.\n\nThis result, a frequency of $1$, indicates that $100\\%$ of the gametes are aneuploid.
