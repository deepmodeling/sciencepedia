In animals, the succinyl-coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA) synthetase isoform couples the thioester cleavage to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) phosphorylation to form guanosine triphosphate (GTP), whereas many plant and bacterial isoforms couple this step to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to form adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Consider the canonical mitochondrial TCA cycle operating with the following well-established, experimentally verified catalytic features in the mitochondrial matrix: (i) citrate synthase condenses oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA to citrate; (ii) aconitase performs an isomerization of citrate to isocitrate; (iii) mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase oxidatively decarboxylates isocitrate to $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD$^{+}$), producing reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH); (iv) $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase oxidatively decarboxylates $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA using NAD$^{+}$, producing NADH; (v) succinyl-CoA synthetase couples thioester cleavage to phosphorylation of GDP to GTP; (vi) succinate dehydrogenase oxidizes succinate to fumarate using flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), producing reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide ($FADH_2$); (vii) fumarase hydrates fumarate to malate; (viii) malate dehydrogenase oxidizes malate to oxaloacetate using NAD$^{+}$, producing NADH.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe foundation of chemical thermodynamics lies in the concept of chemical potential, $\\mu_i$, which is the partial molar Gibbs energy of a species $i$. For a general chemical reaction $\\sum_i \\nu_i X_i = 0$, where $\\nu_i$ are the stoichiometric coefficients (negative for reactants, positive for products) and $X_i$ are the chemical species, the Gibbs energy change of reaction, $\\Delta G$, is given by the sum of the chemical potentials of the products minus the sum of the chemical potentials of the reactants, each weighted by its stoichiometric coefficient:\n$$ \\Delta G = \\sum_i \\nu_i \\mu_i $$\nThe chemical potential of a solute $i$ under non-standard conditions is related to its standard chemical potential, $\\mu_i^\\circ$, by the equation:\n$$ \\mu_i = \\mu_i^\\circ + RT \\ln a_i $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $a_i$ is the activity of species $i$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mu_i$ into the equation for $\\Delta G$ gives:\n$$ \\Delta G = \\sum_i \\nu_i (\\mu_i^\\circ + RT \\ln a_i) = \\sum_i \\nu_i \\mu_i^\\circ + RT \\sum_i \\nu_i \\ln a_i $$\nThe term $\\sum_i \\nu_i \\mu_i^\\circ$ is defined as the standard Gibbs energy change, $\\Delta G^\\circ$. The second term can be rewritten using the properties of logarithms:\n$$ RT \\sum_i \\ln(a_i^{\\nu_i}) = RT \\ln \\left(\\prod_i a_i^{\\nu_i}\\right) $$\nThe product term $\\prod_i a_i^{\\nu_i}$ is the definition of the reaction quotient, $Q$. This leads to the fundamental relationship:\n$$ \\Delta G = \\Delta G^\\circ + RT \\ln Q $$\nFor biochemical reactions, it is conventional to use the standard transformed Gibbs energy, $\\Delta G^{\\circ\\prime}$, which is defined at a standard state of $\\mathrm{pH}\\ 7.0$ and considers the activity of water to be constant and equal to $1$.\n\nThe reaction is the hydrolysis of ATP:\n$$ \\mathrm{ATP} + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{ADP} + P_i $$\nThe reaction quotient, $Q$, for this reaction is expressed in terms of activities:\n$$ Q = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{ADP}} \\cdot a_{P_i}}{a_{\\mathrm{ATP}} \\cdot a_{H_2O}} $$\nThe problem states to assume that the activity coefficients are $1$, so the activity $a_i$ of each solute can be replaced by its molar concentration, $[i]$, relative to the standard state of $1\\ \\mathrm{M}$. The activity of water is given as $a_{H_2O} = 1$. Thus, the expression for $Q$ simplifies to:\n$$ Q = \\frac{[\\mathrm{ADP}][P_i]}{[\\mathrm{ATP}]} $$\nThe given concentrations must be converted from millimolar ($mM$) to molar ($M$):\n$[ATP] = 5\\ \\mathrm{mM} = 5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n$[ADP] = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{mM} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{M} = 5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n$[P_i] = 5\\ \\mathrm{mM} = 5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value of $Q$:\n$$ Q = \\frac{(5 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot (5 \\times 10^{-3})}{5 \\times 10^{-3}} = 5 \\times 10^{-4} $$\nThe actual Gibbs energy change, $\\Delta G$, is calculated using the equation involving the standard transformed Gibbs energy, $\\Delta G^{\\circ\\prime}$:\n$$ \\Delta G = \\Delta G^{\\circ\\prime} + RT \\ln Q $$\nWe are given:\n$\\Delta G^{\\circ\\prime} = -30.5\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$\n$T = 310\\ \\mathrm{K}$\nThe universal gas constant is $R = 8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\ K^{-1}\\ mol^{-1}}$.

The actual flux through the pathway, $C_{\\mathrm{night}}$, will be dictated by the most restrictive constraint, also known as the rate-limiting step or bottleneck. We must therefore analyze each given constraint to find the maximum possible value for $C_{\\mathrm{night}}$.\n\nConstraint 1: Vacuolar storage capacity.\nThe maximum nocturnal titratable acidity change is given as $\\Delta H^{+}_{\\max} = 180\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\, m^{-2}}$. Principle (ii) states that malic acid is diprotic, meaning one mole of accumulated malate, $M$, contributes two moles of hydrogen ions to the titratable acidity of the vacuole.\n$$\\Delta H^{+} = 2M$$\nConsequently, the maximum molar amount of malate that can be stored, $M_{\\max}$, is limited by the maximum acidity change:\n$$M_{\\max} = \\frac{\\Delta H^{+}_{\\max}}{2} = \\frac{180\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\, m^{-2}}}{2} = 90\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\, m^{-2}}$$\nAccording to principle (iii), the fixation of one mole of $CO_2$ at night results in the synthesis of one mole of malate.
