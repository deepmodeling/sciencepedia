It is scientifically grounded in the standard multispecies coalescent model, a cornerstone of modern phylogenomics. It is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and definitions provided for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two stages as requested. First, the coalescent length of the internal branch, $t_{c}$, is calculated. Second, the probability of gene tree discordance is derived and evaluated.\n\nStage 1: Calculation of the coalescent length $t_{c}$.\n\nThe internal branch of the species tree exists for the time interval from $\\tau_{1}$ to $\\tau_{2}$ in the past. The length of this branch in coalescent units, $t_{c}$, is the integral of the coalescent rate, $1/\\left(2N_{e}(t)\\right)$, over this time interval. The effective population size $N_{e}(t)$ is piecewise constant. Let us define the time point where $N_{e}$ changes as $\\tau' = \\tau_{1} + 4.0 \\times 10^{5}$ generations.\nThe integral for $t_{c}$ must be split into two parts corresponding to the two constant values of $N_{e}$.\n\nLet $N_{e,1} = 1.0 \\times 10^{5}$ be the effective size in the interval $[\\tau_{1}, \\tau')$, and $N_{e,2} = 2.5 \\times 10^{5}$ be the effective size in the interval $[\\tau', \\tau_{2}]$.\n\nThe integral is:\n$$\nt_{c} = \\int_{\\tau_{1}}^{\\tau_{2}} \\frac{1}{2 N_{e}(t)} dt = \\int_{\\tau_{1}}^{\\tau'} \\frac{1}{2 N_{e,1}} dt + \\int_{\\tau'}^{\\tau_{2}} \\frac{1}{2 N_{e,2}} dt\n$$\nSince $N_{e,1}$ and $N_{e,2}$ are constants within their respective intervals, the integrals are straightforward:\n$$\nt_{c} = \\frac{\\tau' - \\tau_{1}}{2 N_{e,1}} + \\frac{\\tau_{2} - \\tau'}{2 N_{e,2}}\n$$\nWe substitute the given values.\n$\\tau_{1} = 1.2 \\times 10^{6}$\n$\\tau_{2} = 2.3 \\times 10^{6}$\n$\\tau' = \\tau_{1} + 4.0 \\times 10^{5} = 1.2 \\times 10^{6} + 0.4 \\times 10^{6} = 1.6 \\times 10^{6}$\n\nThe durations of the two segments are:\n- First segment duration: $\\tau' - \\tau_{1} = (1.6 \\times 10^{6}) - (1.2 \\times 10^{6}) = 4.0 \\times 10^{5}$ generations.\n- Second segment duration: $\\tau_{2} - \\tau' = (2.3 \\times 10^{6}) - (1.6 \\times 10^{6}) = 7.0 \\times 10^{5}$ generations.\n\nNow we compute the contribution of each segment to $t_{c}$:\n$$\nt_{c} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{5}}{2 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{5})} + \\frac{7.0 \\times 10^{5}}{2 \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{5})} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{5}}{2.0 \\times 10^{5}} + \\frac{7.0 \\times 10^{5}}{5.0 \\times 10^{5}}\n$$\n$$\nt_{c} = 2.0 + 1.4 = 3.4\n$$\nThe length of the internal branch in coalescent units is $3.4$.\n\nStage 2: Derivation of the probability of discordant gene trees.\n\nWe consider the history of three lineages, one sampled from each species $A$, $B$, and $C$, traced backwards in time.\n- From the present ($t=0$) to time $\\tau_{1}$, the lineages from $A$ and $B$ are in separate ancestral populations. They cannot coalesce with each other, nor with the lineage from $C$.\n- At time $\\tau_{1}$, the ancestral populations of $A$ and $B$ merge. For the time interval from $\\tau_{1}$ to $\\tau_{2}$, the lineages from $A$ and $B$ are in a common ancestral population. The lineage from $C$ is still in a separate population.\n- The species tree topology $\\left(\\left(A,B\\right),C\\right)$ is recovered in the gene tree (concordance) if lineages $A$ and $B$ coalesce with each other before either coalesces with lineage $C$. This can happen in two scenarios:\n  1. Lineages $A$ and $B$ coalesce in the internal branch population, during the time interval whose coalescent length is $t_{c} = 3.4$.\n  2. Lineages $A$ and $B$ fail to coalesce in this interval, and all three lineages ($A$, $B$, $C$) enter the single, deep ancestral population at time $\\tau_{2}$. In this case, concordance requires that the first coalescence event in this deep population is between $A$ and $B$.\n- A discordant gene tree—either $\\left(\\left(A,C\\right),B\\right)$ or $\\left(\\left(B,C\\right),A\\right)$—can only arise if lineages $A$, $B$, and $C$ are all present as distinct lineages in the same population. This requires that lineages $A$ and $B$ *do not* coalesce in the internal branch population.\n\nLet us formalize the probability. According to the MSC model, the waiting time for two lineages to coalesce, when measured in coalescent units ($1$ unit = $2N_{e}$ generations), is exponentially distributed with a rate parameter of $\\lambda=1$.\nThe probability that the two lineages ($A$ and $B$) do not coalesce during the interval of length $t_{c}$ is given by the survival function of the exponential distribution:\n$$\nP(\\text{no coalescence on internal branch}) = \\exp(-1 \\times t_{c}) = \\exp(-t_{c})\n$$\nIf this event occurs, with probability $\\exp(-t_{c})$, then at time $\\tau_{2}$ all three lineages ($A$, $B$, $C$) enter the same ancestral population.\nThe problem statement provides that when three lineages are present, any of the three possible pairs—$(A,B)$, $(A,C)$, or $(B,C)$—is equally likely to be the first to coalesce.\n$$\nP(\\text{pair } (A,B) \\text{ coalesces first} | \\text{3 lineages}) = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n$$\nP(\\text{pair } (A,C) \\text{ coalesces first} | \\text{3 lineages}) = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n$$\nP(\\text{pair } (B,C) \\text{ coalesces first} | \\text{3 lineages}) = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nA discordant topology results if the first coalescence event is between $(A,C)$ or between $(B,C)$. The total probability of a discordant topology, given that all three lineages are present, is the sum of these two probabilities:\n$$\nP(\\text{discordance} | \\text{3 lineages}) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThe total probability of observing a discordant gene tree is the probability that no coalescence occurred on the internal branch multiplied by the probability of a discordant coalescence event in the deep ancestral population.\n$$\nP(\\text{discordant tree}) = P(\\text{no coalescence on internal branch}) \\times P(\\text{discordance} | \\text{3 lineages})\n$$\n$$\nP(\\text{discordant tree}) = \\exp(-t_{c}) \\times \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThis formula is the requested derivation from first principles. Now, we evaluate this expression numerically using the calculated value of $t_{c} = 3.4$.\n$$\nP(\\text{discordant tree}) = \\frac{2}{3} \\exp(-3.4)\n$$\nUsing a calculator for the numerical value:\n$\\exp(-3.4) \\approx 0.03337327$\n$$\nP(\\text{discordant tree}) \\approx \\frac{2}{3} \\times 0.03337327 \\approx 0.022248847\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required by the problem statement, we get $0.02225$.\nThis is the expected total fraction of unlinked loci with a discordant gene tree topology.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.02225}\n$$", "id": "2598316"}, {"introduction": "While incomplete lineage sorting is a ubiquitous source of gene tree conflict, other biological processes like introgression or ancient hybridization can also generate discordant signals. Distinguishing between these scenarios is a critical task in resolving complex evolutionary histories.

The test relies on patterns known as ABBA and BABA across biallelic single nucleotide sites distributed across the genome. Under a null model of incomplete lineage sorting without introgression, the expected genome-wide counts of ABBA and BABA are equal. To quantify deviation from this null in a scale-free manner, a statistic commonly used in phylogenomics normalizes the difference in counts by their total. A standard error for this statistic can be obtained by a block jackknife over genomic blocks, and for large numbers of blocks the ratio of the statistic to its standard error is approximately standard normal, enabling a two-sided significance test.\n\nIn a real dataset, genome-wide counts aggregated across blocks yield $n_{ABBA}=120$ and $n_{BABA}=80$. A block jackknife across the genome provides a standard error $SE=0.05$ for the genome-wide statistic. Using these values:\n- Compute the normalized asymmetry statistic $D$ from the counts.\n- Compute the corresponding $Z$-score by scaling $D$ by its standard error (where $Z$-score denotes the standardized normal deviate).\n- Decide whether the deviation is statistically significant under a two-sided test at significance level $\\alpha=0.05$.\n\nReport your final result as a single row matrix $\\big[D,\\;Z,\\;I\\big]$, where $I=1$ if significant at $\\alpha=0.05$ (two-sided) and $I=0$ otherwise.

The provided numerical values ($n_{ABBA}$, $n_{BABA}$, $SE$, $\\alpha$) are plausible and sufficient for a unique solution. The biological context mentioned—\"a clade that includes both animal and plant exemplars\"—is highly unusual and biologically implausible, as animals and plants do not form a clade in this sense and do not hybridize. However, this contextual peculiarity does not invalidate the mathematical and statistical core of the problem, which is to perform a calculation based on given data. The problem does not demand an explanation of this biological scenario but rather the execution of a well-defined statistical test. Therefore, the problem is formalizable and solvable. The problem is deemed scientifically grounded in its statistical methodology, well-posed, and objective.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe normalized asymmetry statistic, denoted as $D$, is calculated based on the counts of ABBA and BABA patterns. The definition provided in the problem, \"normalizes the difference in counts by their total,\" corresponds to the standard formula:\n$$D = \\frac{n_{ABBA} - n_{BABA}}{n_{ABBA} + n_{BABA}}$$\nSubstituting the given values, $n_{ABBA} = 120$ and $n_{BABA} = 80$:\n$$D = \\frac{120 - 80}{120 + 80} = \\frac{40}{200} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $D = 0.200$.\n\nNext, the Z-score is computed. The problem states this is the ratio of the statistic $D$ to its standard error $SE$.\n$$Z = \\frac{D}{SE}$$\nUsing the calculated value of $D$ and the given standard error $SE = 0.05$:\n$$Z = \\frac{0.2}{0.05} = 4$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $Z = 4.00$.\n\nFinally, we must determine if this result is statistically significant. The test is a two-sided test with a significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$. The test statistic $Z$ is assumed to follow a standard normal distribution, $N(0, 1)$, under the null hypothesis. For a two-sided test at $\\alpha = 0.05$, the critical region is defined by $|Z|  z_{\\alpha/2}$, where $z_{\\alpha/2}$ is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to a tail probability of $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$.\nThe standard critical value is $z_{0.025} \\approx 1.96$.\nWe must compare the absolute value of our calculated Z-score to this critical value.\n$$|Z| = |4.00| = 4.00$$\nThe condition for statistical significance is:\n$$|Z|  1.96$$\nSince $4.00  1.96$, the condition is met. We reject the null hypothesis that the counts of ABBA and BABA patterns are equal, which implies that the observed deviation is statistically significant. Therefore, the indicator variable $I$ is $1$.\n\nThe final result is the row matrix $[D, Z, I]$ with values rounded to three significant figures.\n$D = 0.200$\n$Z = 4.00$\n$I = 1$\nThe resulting matrix is $[0.200, 4.00, 1]$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.200  4.00  1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2598312"}, {"introduction": "In phylogenomic analyses, it is common to generate multiple trees, perhaps from different data subsets or using different inference methods.

In $\\mathcal{S}_{1}$, the bipartitions $\\{A,B\\}\\mid\\dots$ and $\\{C,D\\}\\mid\\dots$ indicate a grouping of $((A,B),(C,D))$. In $\\mathcal{S}_{2}$, the bipartitions $\\{A,C\\}\\mid\\dots$ and $\\{B,D\\}\\mid\\dots$ indicate a grouping of $((A,C),(B,D))$. This accounts for $4$ conflicting bipartitions ($2$ from each tree).\n$2$. The placement of taxa $I$ and $J$ relative to the major clades. In $\\mathcal{S}_{1}$, the bipartition $\\{A,B,C,D,I\\}\\mid\\dots$ shows $I$ is more closely related to $\\{A,B,C,D\\}$ than $J$ is. In $\\mathcal{S}_{2}$, the bipartition $\\{A,B,C,D,J\\}\\mid\\dots$ shows $J$ is more closely related to $\\{A,B,C,D\\}$ than $I$ is. This accounts for $2$ conflicting bipartitions ($1$ from each tree).\n\nThe total RF distance is the sum of these mismatches, $4 + 2 = 6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "2598350"}]}
