This is a classic example of a Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility.\n\n1.  **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is scientifically sound. The assumptions of maternal mitochondrial inheritance, Mendelian segregation at a single nuclear locus, and a specific viability selection model are standard and appropriate for constructing a tractable model of mitonuclear incompatibility.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed.

It is self-contained, logically consistent, and scientifically formalizable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe objective is to calculate the F2 breakdown, which is defined as $1 - \\bar{W}_{F2}$, where $\\bar{W}_{F2}$ is the mean viability of the F2 generation. This requires determining the frequencies of all mitonuclear genotypes in the F2 generation before selection.\n\n**1. F1 Generation Genotypes**\nThe F1 generation is produced from two reciprocal crosses in equal proportions.\n\n- Cross 1: Female $A$ ($m_{A}, n_{A}n_{A}$) $\\times$ Male $B$ ($m_{B}, n_{B}n_{B}$).\n  - Offspring inherit mitochondria from the mother, receiving $m_{A}$.\n  - Offspring receive a gamete with allele $n_{A}$ from the mother and a gamete with allele $n_{B}$ from the father.\n  - The resulting genotype is $(m_{A}, n_{A}n_{B})$.\n\n- Cross 2: Female $B$ ($m_{B}, n_{B}n_{B}$) $\\times$ Male $A$ ($m_{A}, n_{A}n_{A}$).\n  - Offspring inherit mitochondria from the mother, receiving $m_{B}$.\n  - Offspring receive a gamete with allele $n_{B}$ from the mother and a gamete with allele $n_{A}$ from the father.\n  - The resulting genotype is $(m_{B}, n_{A}n_{B})$.\n\nThe pooled F1 population, produced in equal numbers from these crosses, consists of $1/2$ individuals of genotype $(m_{A}, n_{A}n_{B})$ and $1/2$ individuals of genotype $(m_{B}, n_{A}n_{B})$. Note that all F1 individuals are heterozygous $n_{A}n_{B}$ at the nuclear locus.\n\n**2. F2 Generation Zygote Frequencies**\nThe F2 generation is produced by random intercrossing of the pooled F1 individuals. We must determine the frequencies of gametes produced by the F1 population.\n\n- **Nuclear Alleles:** All F1 individuals, both male and female, have the nuclear genotype $n_{A}n_{B}$. Due to Mendelian segregation, they produce gametes containing allele $n_{A}$ with frequency $p = \\frac{1}{2}$ and allele $n_{B}$ with frequency $q = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n- **Mitochondrial Haplotypes:** Mitochondria are inherited maternally. The F1 female population consists of $1/2$ individuals with haplotype $m_{A}$ and $1/2$ with haplotype $m_{B}$. Therefore, $1/2$ of the F2 zygotes will inherit $m_{A}$ and $1/2$ will inherit $m_{B}$.\n\nUnder random mating, the frequencies of nuclear genotypes in the F2 generation will follow Hardy-Weinberg proportions:\n- Frequency of $n_{A}n_{A}$ = $p^2 = (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- Frequency of $n_{A}n_{B}$ = $2pq = 2(\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Frequency of $n_{B}n_{B}$ = $q^2 = (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nSince mitochondrial inheritance is independent of nuclear segregation in this cross structure, we can find the frequencies of the six possible mitonuclear genotypes in the F2 zygote pool by multiplying the probabilities:\n- $P(m_{A}, n_{A}n_{A}) = P(m_{A}) \\times P(n_{A}n_{A}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n- $P(m_{A}, n_{A}n_{B}) = P(m_{A}) \\times P(n_{A}n_{B}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- $P(m_{A}, n_{B}n_{B}) = P(m_{A}) \\times P(n_{B}n_{B}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n- $P(m_{B}, n_{A}n_{A}) = P(m_{B}) \\times P(n_{A}n_{A}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n- $P(m_{B}, n_{A}n_{B}) = P(m_{B}) \\times P(n_{A}n_{B}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- $P(m_{B}, n_{B}n_{B}) = P(m_{B}) \\times P(n_{B}n_{B}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\nThe sum of these frequencies is $\\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} = 1$, as expected.\n\n**3.

Proceeding to solution.\n\nLet $p$ be the frequency of the modifier allele $M$ and $q=1-p$ be the frequency of the resident allele $m$. We assume the male-harming mtDNA is fixed in the population. We define the viabilities of the three nuclear genotypes ($MM$, $Mm$, $mm$) in males and females.\n\nThe baseline viability of a wild-type individual is taken to be $1$.\nIn males, the mtDNA variant reduces viability by a factor of $1-s_m$. The resident genotype $mm$ thus has viability $W_{mm, \\text{male}} = 1 - s_m$. The modifier $M$ partially restores viability.

The variance due to drift in a diploid population of size $N_e$ is $V_{\\delta p} = \\frac{p(1-p)}{2 N_e}$.\n\nFor the nuclear allele, we have $M_{\\delta p} = s p(1-p)$ and $V_{\\delta p} = \\frac{p(1-p)}{2 N_{e}^{\\mathrm{nuc}}}$.\nThe ratio required for the diffusion equation is:\n$$ \\frac{2 M_{\\delta p}}{V_{\\delta p}} = \\frac{2 s p(1-p)}{\\frac{p(1-p)}{2 N_{e}^{\\mathrm{nuc}}}} = 4 N_{e}^{\\mathrm{nuc}} s $$\nThis term is a constant. Let $\\gamma = 4 N_{e}^{\\mathrm{nuc}} s$. The function $\\Psi(x)$ becomes $\\exp(-\\gamma x)$. The fixation probability formula simplifies to:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{fix}}^{\\mathrm{nuc}}(x_0) = \\frac{\\int_0^{x_0} \\exp(-\\gamma x) \\, dx}{\\int_0^1 \\exp(-\\gamma x) \\, dx} = \\frac{\\left[-\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\exp(-\\gamma x)\\right]_0^{x_0}}{\\left[-\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\exp(-\\gamma x)\\right]_0^1} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\gamma x_0)}{1 - \\exp(-\\gamma)} $$\nThe problem states that the new allele arises as a single copy in a diploid genome. The initial frequency is thus $x_0 = \\frac{1}{2 N_{e}^{\\mathrm{nuc}}}$.\nSubstituting $x_0$ and $\\gamma$:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{fix}}^{\\mathrm{nuc}} = \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-(4 N_{e}^{\\mathrm{nuc}} s) \\frac{1}{2 N_{e}^{\\mathrm{nuc}}}\\right)}{1 - \\exp(-4 N_{e}^{\\mathrm{nuc}} s)} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-2s)}{1 - \\exp(-4 N_{e}^{\\mathrm{nuc}} s)} $$\nWe are given $s=0.005$ and $N_{e}^{\\mathrm{nuc}} = 10^{5}$.\nThe exponent in the numerator is $-2s = -2(0.005) = -0.01$.\nThe exponent in the denominator is $-4 N_{e}^{\\mathrm{nuc}} s = -4(10^{5})(0.005) = -4(10^{5})(5 \\times 10^{-3}) = -20 \\times 10^{2} = -2000$.\nSo, the fixation probability is:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{fix}}^{\\mathrm{nuc}} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-0.01)}{1 - \\exp(-2000)} $$\n\nNext, we analyze the case of the haploid mitochondrial allele.\nThe effective population size is $N_{e}^{\\mathrm{mt}} = 2 \\times 10^{4}$. For a haploid population, fitnesses are $1$ and $1+s$. The expected change in allele frequency is $M_{\\delta p} \\approx s p(1-p)$, and the variance due to drift is $V_{\\delta p} = \\frac{p(1-p)}{N_e}$.\nFor the mitochondrial allele, we have $M_{\\delta p} = s p(1-p)$ and $V_{\\delta p} = \\frac{p(1-p)}{N_{e}^{\\mathrm{mt}}}$.\nThe ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{2 M_{\\delta p}}{V_{\\delta p}} = \\frac{2 s p(1-p)}{\\frac{p(1-p)}{N_{e}^{\\mathrm{mt}}}} = 2 N_{e}^{\\mathrm{mt}} s $$\nLet $\\sigma = 2 N_{e}^{\\mathrm{mt}} s$. The fixation probability formula is:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{fix}}^{\\mathrm{mt}}(x_0) = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\sigma x_0)}{1 - \\exp(-\\sigma)} $$\nThe new allele arises as a single copy in a haploid population, so its initial frequency is $x_0 = \\frac{1}{N_{e}^{\\mathrm{mt}}}$.\nSubstituting $x_0$ and $\\sigma$:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{fix}}^{\\mathrm{mt}} = \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-(2 N_{e}^{\\mathrm{mt}} s) \\frac{1}{N_{e}^{\\mathrm{mt}}}\\right)}{1 - \\exp(-2 N_{e}^{\\mathrm{mt}} s)} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-2s)}{1 - \\exp(-2 N_{e}^{\\mathrm{mt}} s)} $$\nWe are given $s=0.005$ and $N_{e}^{\\mathrm{mt}} = 2 \\times 10^{4}$.\nThe exponent in the numerator is again $-2s = -0.01$.\nThe exponent in the denominator is $-2 N_{e}^{\\mathrm{mt}} s = -2(2 \\times 10^{4})(0.005) = -4 \\times 10^{4} \\times 5 \\times 10^{-3} = -20 \\times 10^{1} = -200$.\nSo, the fixation probability is:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{fix}}^{\\mathrm{mt}} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-0.01)}{1 - \\exp(-200)} $$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values.\nFor the nuclear allele:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{fix}}^{\\mathrm{nuc}} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-0.01)}{1 - \\exp(-2000)} $$\nThe term $\\exp(-2000)$ is exceedingly small, rendering the denominator effectively equal to $1$.\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{fix}}^{\\mathrm{nuc}} \\approx 1 - \\exp(-0.01) \\approx 1 - 0.99004983 \\approx 0.00995017 $$\nFor the mitochondrial allele:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{fix}}^{\\mathrm{mt}} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-0.01)}{1 - \\exp(-200)} $$\nThe term $\\exp(-200)$ is also extremely small, so the denominator is again effectively equal to $1$.\n$$ P_{\\mathrm_{\\mathrm{fix}}}^{\\mathrm{mt}} \\approx 1 - \\exp(-0.01) \\approx 0.00995017 $$\nThe theoretical result is that when selection is strong compared to drift (i.e., $N_e s \\gg 1$), the fixation probability of a newly arisen beneficial mutation approaches a limit that is independent of the effective population size. In both cases, $N_{e}^{\\mathrm{nuc}} s = 10^5 \\times 0.005 = 500$ and $N_{e}^{\\mathrm{mt}} s = 2 \\times 10^4 \\times 0.005 = 100$. Both are much greater than $1$, so the approximation is valid. The fixation probability in this regime is approximately $2s$ for both the additive diploid and haploid cases. The formula numerator $1-\\exp(-2s)$ gives a more precise value.\n\nRounding both results to four significant figures yields $0.009950$. The final answer is a row vector of these two values.\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} P_{\\mathrm{fix}}^{\\mathrm{nuc}}  P_{\\mathrm{fix}}^{\\mathrm{mt}} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.009950  0.009950 \\end{pmatrix} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.009950  0.009950 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2602160"}]}
