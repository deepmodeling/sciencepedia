It is a standard, well-posed problem in molecular phylogenetics. I will proceed with a full derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the time ($t$) since a duplication event based on the synonymous divergence ($K_s$) between the resulting paralogous genes.\n\nLet us begin from first principles. The duplication event creates two identical gene copies from a single ancestral gene. Let this event occur at time $t=0$. We are interested in the time $t$ that has passed since this event. After duplication, the two copies evolve independently along two separate lineages.\n\nThe substitution rate is given as $r$, in units of substitutions per site per year per lineage. This is the rate at which substitutions accumulate in a single evolutionary line.\n\nThe divergence between the two paralogous sequences is the result of substitutions accumulating in *both* lineages. The total evolutionary time separating the two contemporary sequences is the sum of the lengths of the two branches back to their common ancestor, the duplication node. Each branch has a length of $t$ years. Thus, the total evolutionary path length between the two sequences is $t + t = 2t$.\n\nAccording to the strict molecular clock hypothesis, the number of substitutions is proportional to time. The rate of divergence between the two sequences, let us call it $k_{div}$, is the rate at which differences accumulate between them. Since the two lineages are evolving independently, this rate is the sum of their individual substitution rates.\n$$k_{div} = r_{lineage\\,1} + r_{lineage\\,2}$$\nGiven that both lineages evolve at the same rate $r$, we have:\n$$k_{div} = r + r = 2r$$\n\nThe total synonymous divergence, $K_s$, represents the expected number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site that have occurred between the two sequences since they diverged. It is the product of the rate of divergence and the time elapsed.\n$$K_s = k_{div} \\times t$$\nSubstituting the expression for $k_{div}$, we obtain the fundamental relationship:\n$$K_s = (2r)t$$\n\nIt is important to note that the problem specifies $K_s$ as the Jukes-Cantor corrected distance. This means the provided value of $K_s=1.2$ already accounts for multiple substitutions occurring at the same site over time and directly represents the expected number of substitutions per site. Therefore, the linear relationship derived above is appropriate. If we were given the raw proportion of different sites, $p$, we would first need to compute $K_s$ using the Jukes-Cantor formula, $K = -\\frac{3}{4}\\ln(1-\\frac{4}{3}p)$, but this is not necessary here.\n\nFrom the derived equation, we can now solve for the time since duplication, $t$:\n$$t = \\frac{K_s}{2r}$$\nThis is the required expression for $t$ derived from first principles.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided values:\n-   $K_s = 1.2$ (dimensionless, substitutions per site)\n-   $r = 6 \\times 10^{-9}$ (substitutions per site per year)\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $t$:\n$$t = \\frac{1.2}{2 \\times (6 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ year}^{-1})}$$\n$$t = \\frac{1.2}{12 \\times 10^{-9}} \\text{ years}$$\n$$t = \\frac{1.2}{1.2 \\times 10^{-8}} \\text{ years}$$\n$$t = 1 \\times 10^8 \\text{ years}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in million years (Ma), where $1 \\text{ Ma} = 10^6$ years.\n$$t = (1 \\times 10^8) \\text{ years} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ Ma}}{10^6 \\text{ years}} = 100 \\text{ Ma}$$\n\nFinally, the answer must be rounded to four significant figures.

By doing so, you will learn how to quantitatively test a major evolutionary hypothesis and determine if observed patterns of gene retention support the predictions of dosage-balance theory.", "problem": "A long-standing prediction of the dosage-balance hypothesis is that dosage-sensitive gene classes, such as transcription factors and protein kinases, are preferentially retained after Whole-Genome Duplication (WGD) relative to Small-Scale Duplication (SSD), because WGD preserves stoichiometric balance among interacting partners, whereas SSD does not. Consider a comparative dataset pooled across representative vertebrate and angiosperm clades, in which retained duplicate genes have been classified by duplication mechanism (WGD versus SSD) and by gene class (transcription factor, kinase, metabolic enzyme).
