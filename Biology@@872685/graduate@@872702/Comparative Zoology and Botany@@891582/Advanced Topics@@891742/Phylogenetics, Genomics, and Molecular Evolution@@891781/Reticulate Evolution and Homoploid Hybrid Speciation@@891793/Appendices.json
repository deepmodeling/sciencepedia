An outgroup $O$ is available to polarize relationships. You have inferred rooted gene trees at $L=600$ unlinked loci (each locus spans a recombination-free region). A summary of the inferred topologies, restricted to the quartet $\\{A,B,C,O\\}$, is:\n- Concordant with the species tree $((A,B),C)$: $n_{\\text{conc}}=330$.\n- Discordant topology $((A,C),B)$: $n_{AC|B}=180$.\n- Discordant topology $((B,C),A)$: $n_{BC|A}=90$.\nAssume gene tree inference error is negligible and approximately symmetric across discordant topologies.\n\nBackground and first principles:\n- Under the Multispecies Coalescent (MSC), incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) can generate gene trees discordant with the species tree even in the absence of gene flow. For a rooted three-taxon species tree with internal branch length $t$ (in coalescent units), a core property of the MSC is that the two discordant gene tree topologies have equal probability under ILS-only. This follows from exchangeability of lineages in the ancestral population, which implies that, conditional on a failure to coalesce on the internal branch, any of the three pairs of lineages are equally likely to coalesce first in the deeper ancestral population.\n- Reticulate evolution by introgression breaks this symmetry by elevating the frequency of the discordant topology that groups the introgressing lineages.\n\nYour goal is to choose a valid statistical testing procedure that:\n- Clearly states the null and alternative hypotheses appropriate for distinguishing ILS-only from introgression.\n- Specifies a test statistic with a known or computable null distribution.\n- Controls the Type I error at a pre-specified level $\\alpha=0.05$.\n- When applied to the dataset above, would lead to a rejection of the ILS-only model if justified.\n\nWhich of the following options satisfy these requirements, and, when applied to the counts above, would reject ILS-only at $\\alpha=0.05$?\n\nA. Define the null hypothesis $H_{0}$ as ILS-only under the MSC, which implies that the two discordant topologies occur with equal probability. Condition on the total number of discordant gene trees $k=n_{AC|B}+n_{BC|A}$ and use an exact binomial test of $H_{0}: p=\\tfrac{1}{2}$ versus $H_{A}: p\\neq \\tfrac{1}{2}$, where $p$ is the probability that a discordant gene tree is of type $((A,C),B)$. Use the test statistic $T=\\lvert n_{AC|B}-k/2\\rvert$ with the exact binomial null distribution to compute a two-sided $p$-value, rejecting when the $p$-value is less than $\\alpha=0.05$. To account for any residual linkage, partition loci into approximately independent genomic blocks and verify calibration via a block bootstrap that recomputes $T$ across resampled blocks. Apply this test to the data above.\n\nB. Define $H_{0}$ as ILS-only under the MSC with equal probability for all three rooted gene tree topologies.

Apply this procedure to the data above.\n\nSelect all that apply.", "solution": "The problem requires the evaluation of statistical procedures for detecting introgression against a background of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) using gene tree topology counts. The fundamental principle for this test derives from the Multispecies Coalescent (MSC) model. For a three-taxon species tree, such as $((A,B),C)$ considered here, the MSC model makes a specific prediction under the null hypothesis of no gene flow ($H_0$: ILS-only). While the gene tree topology concordant with the species tree, $((A,B),C)$, is expected to be the most frequent for a sufficiently long internal branch, the two discordant topologies, $((A,C),B)$ and $((B,C),A)$, are predicted to occur with equal probability. This is because, conditional on ILS occurring (i.e., the lineages ancestral to $A$ and $B$ fail to coalesce in their most recent common ancestral population), the three lineages remaining in the deeper ancestral population of $(A,B,C)$ are exchangeable, meaning any pair is equally likely to coalesce first.\n\nReticulate evolution, such as introgression between species $A$ and $C$, would transfer genetic material that increases the frequency of shared ancestry between them, elevating the count of gene trees with the $((A,C),B)$ topology. This breaks the symmetry expected under ILS-only. Therefore, a statistical test for introgression can be formulated as a test for a significant deviation from a $1:1$ ratio in the counts of the two discordant topologies.\n\nThe provided data are:\n-   Total loci: $L=600$.\n-   Count of concordant topology $((A,B),C)$: $n_{\\text{conc}}=330$.\n-   Count of discordant topology $((A,C),B)$: $n_{AC|B}=180$.\n-   Count of discordant topology $((B,C),A)$: $n_{BC|A}=90$.\n\nThe total number of discordant gene trees is $k = n_{AC|B} + n_{BC|A} = 180 + 90 = 270$. The null hypothesis $H_0$ (ILS-only) predicts that, out of these $k=270$ discordant trees, the expected counts for the two types are equal: $E(n_{AC|B}) = E(n_{BC|A}) = k/2 = 135$. The observed counts show a strong asymmetry ($180$ versus $90$), which we must now formally test with the procedures proposed in each option at a significance level of $\\alpha=0.05$.\n\nA. This option proposes a test based on the symmetry of discordant topologies.\n-   **Hypotheses**: The null hypothesis is $H_{0}: p=\\tfrac{1}{2}$, where $p$ is the probability that a randomly chosen discordant gene tree has the topology $((A,C),B)$. The alternative is $H_{A}: p\\neq \\tfrac{1}{2}$. This correctly formalizes the test for symmetry breaking by introgression.\n-   **Test and Statistic**: It conditions on the total number of discordant trees, $k=270$, and uses an exact binomial test. This is a standard and statistically valid approach. It correctly identifies the number of \"trials\" as $k=270$ and the number of \"successes\" (e.g., topology $((A,C),B)$) as $n_{AC|B}=180$. The test statistic $T=\\lvert n_{AC|B}-k/2\\rvert$ measures deviation from the null expectation.\n-   **Application**: We test whether observing $180$ successes in $270$ trials is significantly different from the expectation of $135$ under $H_0: p=0.5$. The two-sided $p$-value is the probability of observing a result at least as extreme as $180$, which is $P(X \\ge 180) + P(X \\le 90)$ where $X \\sim B(270, 0.5)$. Due to the large sample size, we can use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution with continuity correction. The mean is $\\mu = kp = 270 \\times 0.5 = 135$, and the standard deviation is $\\sigma = \\sqrt{kp(1-p)} = \\sqrt{270 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.5} = \\sqrt{67.5} \\approx 8.216$. The Z-score is:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\lvert n_{AC|B} - \\mu \\rvert - 0.5}{\\sigma} = \\frac{\\lvert 180 - 135 \\rvert - 0.5}{8.216} = \\frac{44.5}{8.216} \\approx 5.416 $$\nThe critical Z-value for a two-sided test at $\\alpha=0.05$ is $Z_{\\alpha/2} = 1.96$. Since our observed Z-score of $5.416$ is far greater than $1.96$, the $p$-value is extremely small ($p \\ll 0.05$). Thus, the null hypothesis would be rejected. The mention of a block bootstrap is an additional detail concerning good practice for potentially linked data but does not alter the validity of the core statistical procedure itself.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**. The procedure is statistically valid and leads to a rejection of the null hypothesis with the given data.\n\nB. This option proposes a chi-square goodness-of-fit test.\n-   **Hypotheses**: $H_0$ is that all three rooted gene tree topologies have equal probability, i.e., $P(((A,B),C)) = P(((A,C),B)) = P(((B,C),A)) = 1/3$.\n-   **Critique**: This null hypothesis is scientifically unsound. The MSC model for a bifurcating species tree does not predict equal probabilities for the three topologies, except for the special case of an internal branch of length $t=0$ (a hard polytomy). For any $t0$, the probability of the concordant topology is $P_{\\text{conc}} = 1 - \\frac{2}{3}e^{-t}$, while the probability of each discordant topology is $P_{\\text{disc}} = \\frac{1}{3}e^{-t}$. Thus, $P_{\\text{conc}}  P_{\\text{disc}}$ for any resolved species history. Testing against an incorrect null hypothesis does not constitute a valid test for distinguishing ILS from introgression on a specified species tree.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The procedure is invalid because its null hypothesis is an incorrect representation of the ILS-only model.\n\nC. This option proposes a likelihood ratio test (LRT) between a phylogenetic network and a species tree.\n-   **Procedure**: This is a powerful, model-based approach where one directly compares the likelihood of the data under a model with introgression ($H_A$) and one without ($H_0$).\n-   **Critique**: The procedure specifies using an asymptotic $\\chi^{2}$ null distribution for the LRT statistic. This is a critical statistical error in this context. The null hypothesis of no introgression sets the introgression probability parameter, $\\gamma$, to zero. Since $\\gamma$ cannot be negative, this is a test on the boundary of the parameter space. Standard LRT theory, which yields an asymptotic $\\chi^2$ distribution, does not hold in this case. The correct asymptotic null distribution is a mixture of $\\chi^2$ distributions (e.g., a $50:50$ mixture of a point mass at $0$ and a $\\chi^2_1$ distribution). Using a standard $\\chi^2$ distribution would result in an improperly calibrated test, typically with an inflated Type I error rate. A procedure that fails to control Type I error at the specified level $\\alpha$ is not valid.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The procedure as stated is statistically invalid due to the mis-specification of the null distribution for the test statistic.\n\nD. This option proposes a parametric bootstrap procedure.\n-   **Hypotheses and Statistic**: The null hypothesis is ILS-only on the species tree $((A,B),C)$, and the test statistic is $T=\\lvert n_{AC|B}-n_{BC|A}\\rvert$. This statistic directly quantifies the asymmetry that is the hallmark of introgression. For the observed data, $T_{\\text{obs}} = \\lvert 180 - 90 \\rvert = 90$.\n-   **Procedure**: A parametric bootstrap is used to generate the null distribution of $T$. This involves (1) estimating the parameters of the MSC model (e.g., branch lengths) under $H_0$ using the observed data, (2) simulating a large number of replicate datasets of $L=600$ gene trees from this fitted null model, (3) calculating the statistic $T^*$ for each replicate, and (4) computing a $p$-value as the proportion of replicates where $T^* \\ge T_{\\text{obs}}$.\n-   **Critique**: This is a statistically rigorous and valid framework. Parametric bootstrapping is a gold-standard method for hypothesis testing in complex models, as it does not rely on asymptotic theory that may be inappropriate (as in Option C). It constructs an empirical null distribution that accurately reflects the null hypothesis.\n-   **Application**: Under $H_0$, the rates of the two discordant topologies are equal. The proportion of concordant trees is $330/600 = 0.55$. This allows estimation of the internal branch length under the MSC: $1 - \\frac{2}{3}e^{-t} = 0.55 \\implies t \\approx 0.393$. The expected proportion for each discordant topology is $\\frac{1}{3}e^{-t} \\approx 0.225$. The expected counts are thus $n_{AC|B} = n_{BC|A} = 600 \\times 0.225 = 135$. The observed statistic $T_{\\text{obs}} = 90$ represents a massive deviation from the expected difference of $0$. It is virtually certain that a parametric bootstrap would yield a $p$-value far smaller than $0.05$, leading to rejection of $H_0$.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**. The procedure is statistically valid and robust, and it would reject the null hypothesis with the given data.\n\nIn summary, both Option A and Option D describe valid statistical procedures for testing the hypothesis of introgression, and both would lead to a strong rejection of the null hypothesis of ILS-only given the substantial asymmetry in the provided gene tree counts.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2607882"}, {"introduction": "Patterson’s $D$-statistic, also known as the ABBA-BABA test, is a powerful tool for quantifying genome-wide asymmetry in allele sharing patterns to detect gene flow.

For each chromosome, markers span the entire chromosome from the first to the last listed marker (i.e., there is no additional genetic length outside the listed range), and the interval between adjacent markers is fully covered.\n\nChromosome 1 markers (cM): $0, 20, 55, 95, 135$.\n\nChromosome 2 markers (cM): $0, 30, 60, 95$.\n\nChromosome 3 markers (cM): $0, 25, 48, 70$.\n\nLet the donor ancestry proportion be $m = 0.30$ and time since the admixture pulse be $t = 20$ generations. Work in the continuous-genome limit and ignore end effects due to chromosome termini.\n\nUsing only the fundamental bases stated above, derive from first principles expressions for:\n1) The expected number of species $\\mathrm{A}$ ancestry tracts across the three autosomes after $t$ generations.\n2) The mean length of species $\\mathrm{A}$ ancestry tracts after $t$ generations.\n\nThen evaluate these expressions numerically for the given data. Express the expected number as a pure number and the mean length in Morgans. Round both numerical results to four significant figures. Provide your final answer as two values in the order (expected number, mean length).", "solution": "The problem is validated as self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. The solution proceeds by deriving the required expressions from the fundamental principles provided.\n\nLet $m$ be the donor ancestry proportion from species A, and $t$ be the number of generations since the admixture pulse. The total genetic length of the genome is $L_{total}$, composed of $N_{chr} = 3$ chromosomes.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Expected Number of Ancestry Tracts**\n\nWe begin by deriving the expected density of ancestry junctions. An ancestry junction is a point on a chromosome where the ancestry switches (e.g., from species A to B, or B to A).\n\nAccording to the problem's stated bases:\n- A junction is created when a crossover occurs in a meiosis at a position that is heterozygous for ancestry.\n- The expected number of crossovers per meiosis along a chromosome of length $L$ Morgans is $L$. For a Poisson process, this implies a rate of $1$ crossover per Morgan per meiosis.\n- The ancestry heterozygosity at any site, which is the probability that a diploid individual is heterozygous for ancestry at that site, is given as a constant value $H = 2m(1-m)$.\n\nThe rate of new junction formation per Morgan, per generation, is the product of the crossover rate and the probability of ancestry heterozygosity. Let $\\rho(t)$ be the density of junctions per Morgan at generation $t$. The rate of change of this density is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\rho(t)}{dt} = (\\text{crossover rate}) \\times (\\text{ancestry heterozygosity}) = 1 \\times [2m(1-m)] = 2m(1-m)\n$$\nWe assume that at the time of the pulse, $t=0$, the chromosomes are of pure A or B ancestry, so there are no junctions within any chromosome. Thus, the initial condition is $\\rho(0) = 0$.\n\nIntegrating this differential equation from $t=0$ to the present generation $t$ gives the total accumulated junction density:\n$$\n\\rho(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} 2m(1-m) \\,d\\tau = 2m(1-m)t\n$$\nThe total expected number of junctions across the entire genome, $E[N_J]$, is the product of this density and the total genetic length of the genome, $L_{total}$:\n$$\nE[N_J] = \\rho(t) \\times L_{total} = 2m(1-m)tL_{total}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the expected number of A-ancestry tracts, $E[N_A]$. We are instructed to ignore end effects due to chromosome termini. This implies a model where the genome is long enough that the tracts at the ends of chromosomes do not significantly alter the overall statistics. In this limit, the number of A-tracts is expected to be equal to the number of B-tracts, as any switch from A to B must be followed by a switch from B to A to create the next A-tract. The total number of tracts is approximately the number of junctions. Therefore, the number of A-tracts is half the total number of junctions.\n$$\nE[N_A] = \\frac{1}{2} E[N_J]\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E[N_J]$, we obtain the first required expression:\n$$\nE[N_A] = \\frac{1}{2} [2m(1-m)tL_{total}] = m(1-m)tL_{total}\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Mean Length of Ancestry Tracts**\n\nThe mean length of A-ancestry tracts is the total expected length of all A-ancestry segments divided by the expected number of A-ancestry tracts.\n\nThe total expected length of species A ancestry, $E[L_{A,total}]$, across a genome of total length $L_{total}$ is given by the proportion of A-ancestry, $m$, multiplied by the total length:\n$$\nE[L_{A,total}] = m \\times L_{total}\n$$\nThe mean length of an A-tract, $E[\\bar{L}_A]$, is then:\n$$\nE[\\bar{L}_A] = \\frac{E[L_{A,total}]}{E[N_A]}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions we derived for $E[L_{A,total}]$ and $E[N_A]$:\n$$\nE[\\bar{L}_A] = \\frac{m L_{total}}{m(1-m)tL_{total}}\n$$\nThe terms $m$ and $L_{total}$ cancel, yielding the second required expression:\n$$\nE[\\bar{L}_A] = \\frac{1}{(1-m)t}\n$$\nThis result is independent of the total genome length and depends only on the time since admixture and the proportion of the alternative ancestry.\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total genetic length, $L_{total}$, from the provided marker data. The unit conversion is $1 \\text{ cM} = 0.01 \\text{ M}$.\n- Chromosome $1$ length: $L_1 = (135 - 0) \\text{ cM} = 135 \\text{ cM} = 1.35 \\text{ M}$.\n- Chromosome $2$ length: $L_2 = (95 - 0) \\text{ cM} = 95 \\text{ cM} = 0.95 \\text{ M}$.\n- Chromosome $3$ length: $L_3 = (70 - 0) \\text{ cM} = 70 \\text{ cM} = 0.70 \\text{ M}$.\n\nThe total length of the three autosomes is:\n$$\nL_{total} = L_1 + L_2 + L_3 = 1.35 \\text{ M} + 0.95 \\text{ M} + 0.70 \\text{ M} = 3.00 \\text{ M}\n$$\nThe given parameters are $m = 0.30$ and $t = 20$ generations.\n\nNow we evaluate the derived expressions, rounding to four significant figures as requested.\n\nExpected number of species A ancestry tracts:\n$$\nE[N_A] = m(1-m)tL_{total} = (0.30)(1 - 0.30)(20)(3.00) = (0.30)(0.70)(60) = 0.21 \\times 60 = 12.6\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, the result is $12.60$.\n\nMean length of species A ancestry tracts (in Morgans):\n$$\nE[\\bar{L}_A] = \\frac{1}{(1-m)t} = \\frac{1}{(1 - 0.30)(20)} = \\frac{1}{(0.70)(20)} = \\frac{1}{14} \\text{ M}\n$$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $0.07142857...$ M.
