The described process of diatom valve formation is a valid subject of biophysical inquiry. The parameters provided are plausible and dimensionally consistent, although they require careful unit conversion. The problem asks for the *average molar rate of deposition required* to build a specified structure in a given time. This can be calculated directly from the final mass of the structure and the time interval. The provided Michaelis–Menten kinetic parameters ($[S]_{\\mathrm{ext}}$, $K_{m}$, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$) and the SDV volume ($V_{\\mathrm{SDV}}$) pertain to the silicic acid transport mechanism, which determines the *actual* rate of uptake, but they are not necessary for calculating the *target* average rate based on the final product. The inclusion of this superfluous information does not invalidate the problem; rather, it tests the ability to distinguish relevant from irrelevant data. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**, and a solution can be derived from the specified first principles.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe objective is to compute the average molar rate of silica deposition, which we denote as $R_{avg}$. By definition, an average rate is the total quantity of substance deposited divided by the total time elapsed.\n\nThe average molar rate $R_{avg}$ is given by:\n$$\nR_{avg} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}}}{T}\n$$\nwhere $n_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}}$ is the total number of moles of silica ($\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}$) in the valve and $T$ is the formation time.\n\nThe number of moles $n_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}}$ is determined from the total mass of silica, $m_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}}$, and its molar mass, $M_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}}$.\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}}}{M_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}}}\n$$\n\nThe mass $m_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}}$ is the product of the density of biogenic silica, $\\rho$, and the actual volume of solid silica in the valve, $V_{\\mathrm{solid}}$.\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}} = \\rho \\cdot V_{\\mathrm{solid}}\n$$\n\nThe valve is modeled as a circular plate of radius $r$ and mean thickness $t$. The total volume of this geometric envelope, $V_{\\mathrm{plate}}$, is:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{plate}} = A \\cdot t = (\\pi r^2) \\cdot t\n$$\nThe problem specifies a silica solid fraction $f_{s}$ to account for the porosity and patterning of the valve. The actual volume of solid silica, $V_{\\mathrm{solid}}$, is therefore:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{solid}} = f_{s} \\cdot V_{\\mathrm{plate}} = f_{s} \\pi r^2 t\n$$\n\nCombining these equations, we can express the average molar rate $R_{avg}$ in terms of the given parameters:\n$$\nR_{avg} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}}}{T} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}}}{T \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}}} = \\frac{\\rho \\cdot V_{\\mathrm{solid}}}{T \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}}} = \\frac{\\rho f_{s} \\pi r^2 t}{T M_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}}}\n$$\n\nTo perform the calculation, all parameters must be in a consistent system of units.

In seawater, the molar magnesium-to-calcium ratio is near $5$, providing a high activity of $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ relative to $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$. The smaller ionic radius of $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ relative to $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ in sixfold coordination, $r_{\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}}=0.72\\,\\text{\\AA}$ versus $r_{\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}}=1.00\\,\\text{\\AA}$, implies that when $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ substitutes for $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ in calcite, the lattice contracts.

Organisms can overcome such kinetic barriers by modulating the chemistry of the mineralizing interface, for example via acidic macromolecules that lower the dehydration penalty and stabilize specific ion complexes. In echinoderms, the organic matrix within the stereom can locally concentrate and dehydrate $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$, so that despite kinetic challenges, the high environmental availability of $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ in modern seawater is translated into substantial substitution in the calcite lattice, yielding high-magnesium calcite.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution without internal contradictions. The definitions are clear and objective. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe objective is to compute the dimensionless vulnerability index $V$, defined as the ratio of the characteristic dissolution times for aragonite and calcite, $V = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{arag}}}{t_{\\mathrm{calc}}}$.\n\nFirst, we must derive an expression for the time $t_i$ required to dissolve a uniform surface layer of thickness $h$ from a mineral $i$. The dissolution flux, $R_i$, is defined as the number of moles of solid removed per unit surface area per unit time. Its units are $\\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nConsider a surface area $A$. The total number of moles, $N_i$, dissolved in a time interval $t_i$ is given by:\n$$N_i = R_i \\cdot A \\cdot t_i$$\nThe mass, $m_i$, corresponding to this number of moles is:\n$$m_i = N_i \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}} = (R_i \\cdot A \\cdot t_i) \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}$$\nwhere $M_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}$ is the molar mass of calcium carbonate. The volume, $v_i$, of the dissolved material is related to its mass and density, $\\rho_i$, by:\n$$v_i = \\frac{m_i}{\\rho_i} = \\frac{R_i \\cdot A \\cdot t_i \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}}{\\rho_i}$$\nFor a uniform dissolution process, this volume corresponds to a removed layer of thickness $h$ over the area $A$, such that $v_i = A \\cdot h$. Therefore:\n$$A \\cdot h = \\frac{R_i \\cdot A \\cdot t_i \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}}{\\rho_i}$$\nThe area $A$ cancels, as expected, because the dissolution is a surface phenomenon. We can now solve for the time $t_i$:\n$$t_i = \\frac{h \\cdot \\rho_i}{R_i \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}}$$\nThis expression relates the dissolution time to the physical properties of the mineral ($\\rho_i$), the environmental conditions and mineral reactivity (encapsulated in $R_i$), and the common parameters ($h, M_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}$).\n\nNext, we compute the vulnerability index $V$ by taking the ratio of the dissolution times for aragonite and calcite:\n$$V = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{arag}}}{t_{\\mathrm{calc}}} = \\frac{\\frac{h \\cdot \\rho_{\\mathrm{arag}}}{R_{\\mathrm{arag}} \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}}}{\\frac{h \\cdot \\rho_{\\mathrm{calc}}}{R_{\\mathrm{calc}} \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}}}$$\nThe common parameters $h$ and $M_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}$ cancel, yielding a simplified expression for $V$:\n$$V = \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{arag}}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{calc}}} \\cdot \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{calc}}}{R_{\\mathrm{arag}}}$$\nThe dissolution rates, $R_i$, are calculated using the provided kinetic law, $R_i = k_i (1-\\Omega_i)^{n_i}$. Substituting this into the expression for $V$:\n$$V = \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{arag}}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{calc}}} \\cdot \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{calc}}(1-\\Omega_{\\mathrm{calc}})^{n_{\\mathrm{calc}}}}{k_{\\mathrm{arag}}(1-\\Omega_{\\mathrm{arag}})^{n_{\\mathrm{arag}}}}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this final symbolic expression.
