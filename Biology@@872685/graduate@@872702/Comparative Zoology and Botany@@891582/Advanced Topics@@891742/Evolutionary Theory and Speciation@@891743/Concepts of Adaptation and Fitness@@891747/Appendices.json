In state 1 years, its absolute per-generation fitness (expected multiplicative growth in numbers per generation) is $W_1 = 0.5$, and in state 2 years it is $W_2 = 2.0$. The sequence of environments is strictly alternating and extends indefinitely into the future. Assume non-overlapping generations and that selection acts on multiplicative long-term growth.\n\nUsing only core definitions of absolute fitness, the arithmetic mean across environments, and the long-term multiplicative growth criterion based on the average of logarithmic fitness across time, do the following:\n\n1) Compute the arithmetic mean fitness across years, $M_A$.\n2) Compute the long-term multiplicative mean fitness across years (the geometric mean fitness), $M_G$.\n3) Consider an alternative, variance-reducing phenotype that achieves a constant per-generation absolute fitness $W_c$ in every year, regardless of environmental state.

No rounding is required. Express your answer without units.", "solution": "The problem requires a series of calculations and an interpretation based on fundamental principles of evolutionary fitness in fluctuating environments.\n\n1) Computation of the arithmetic mean fitness, $M_A$.\nThe environment alternates strictly between two states. Over any two-year cycle, the population experiences one year with fitness $W_1$ and one year with fitness $W_2$. The arithmetic mean fitness, $M_A$, is the simple average of the fitness values across these environmental states.\n$$\nM_A = \\frac{W_1 + W_2}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values, $W_1 = 0.5$ and $W_2 = 2.0$:\n$$\nM_A = \\frac{0.5 + 2.0}{2} = \\frac{2.5}{2} = 1.25\n$$\nThe arithmetic mean fitness is $1.25$.\n\n2) Computation of the long-term multiplicative mean fitness, $M_G$.\nThe long-term multiplicative growth rate of a population is determined by the geometric mean of its per-generation fitness values, not the arithmetic mean. Let the initial population size be $N_0$. After one generation in state $1$, the size is $N_1 = N_0 W_1$. After a second generation in state $2$, the size is $N_2 = N_1 W_2 = N_0 W_1 W_2$.\nOver a period of $T$ generations, the final population size is $N_T = N_0 \\prod_{t=1}^{T} W_t$. The average per-generation growth factor is the $T$-th root of the total multiplicative change, which is the geometric mean:\n$$\nM_G = \\left( \\prod_{t=1}^{T} W_t \\right)^{\\frac{1}{T}}\n$$\nFor a two-year cycle, $T=2$, and the product is $W_1 W_2$. The long-term multiplicative mean fitness is therefore the geometric mean of $W_1$ and $W_2$:\n$$\nM_G = (W_1 W_2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nM_G = (0.5 \\times 2.0)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = (1.0)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 1.0\n$$\nThe geometric mean fitness is $1.0$.\n\n3) Derivation of the critical constant fitness, $W_c^{\\ast}$.\nAn alternative phenotype exhibits a constant fitness $W_c$ in all years. Its long-term multiplicative growth over any period is simply $W_c$. We are asked to find the critical value, $W_c^{\\ast}$, that yields the same long-term multiplicative growth as the fluctuating phenotype. This means we must equate the long-term growth rate of the constant phenotype ($W_c$) to the long-term growth rate of the fluctuating phenotype ($M_G$).\n$$\nW_c^{\\ast} = M_G = (W_1 W_2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$\nUsing the value for $M_G$ calculated in the previous step:\n$$\nW_c^{\\ast} = 1.0\n$$\n\nInterpretation:\nThe results show a stark contrast between two measures of average fitness. The arithmetic mean, $M_A = 1.25$, suggests that the population should experience a $25\\%$ increase in size on average per generation. However, the true long-term growth is dictated by the geometric mean, $M_G = 1.0$, which indicates the population size is, in fact, static over the long term. A population with fitness $0.5$ one year and $2.0$ the next will return to its original size every two years ($N_{t+2} = N_t \\times 0.5 \\times 2.0 = N_t$).\n\nThe critical fitness for an equivalent constant strategy, $W_c^{\\ast} = 1.0$, is numerically equal to the geometric mean fitness of the fluctuating strategy. This value is significantly less than the arithmetic mean fitness ($1.0  1.25$). This inequality, $M_G \\le M_A$, is a general mathematical property (the AM-GM inequality), and the difference between the two means increases with the variance of the fitness values.\n\nIn evolutionary terms, selection acts on long-term multiplicative growth. A hypothetical mutant with a constant fitness $W_c > 1.0$, for instance $W_c = 1.01$, would have a greater long-term growth rate than the fluctuating phenotype ($1.01 > 1.0$). This mutant would therefore invade and replace the original population, even though its arithmetic mean fitness ($1.01$) is lower than that of the original population ($1.25$).\n\nThis phenomenon, often termed \"bet-hedging,\" explains why selection can favor strategies that reduce the variance in fitness across generations, even at the cost of reducing the arithmetic mean fitness. In comparative zoology and botany, this principle underlies the evolution of many traits. For example, seed dormancy in desert annuals allows a lineage to \"skip\" disastrously dry years (where fitness would be near zero), and iteroparity (repeated reproduction) in animals allows individuals to average out reproductive success over many seasons, buffering them against the catastrophic impact of a single bad year.
