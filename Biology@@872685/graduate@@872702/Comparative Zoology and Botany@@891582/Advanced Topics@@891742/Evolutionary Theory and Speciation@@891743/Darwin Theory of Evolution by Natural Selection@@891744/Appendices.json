This setting is intended to illustrate the same Darwinian mechanism of differential survival that also operates in animal populations. Consider a single locus with two alleles, $A$ and $a$, and three genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$. At the start of the season (zygote stage), the genotype frequencies in a large, closed population are $x_{AA} = 0.30$, $x_{Aa} = 0.50$, and $x_{aa} = 0.20$. Under high salinity, the relative viabilities (relative fitnesses) are $w_{AA} = 0.88$, $w_{Aa} = 0.96$, and $w_{aa} = 0.52$, measured as survival probabilities scaled relative to the best-surviving genotype in this environment. Assume discrete, non-overlapping generations, viability selection only within the season, random mating after selection, and no mutation, migration, or genetic drift.\n\nUsing only fundamental principles—namely, that relative fitness scales survival in proportion to $w$ for each genotype, that post-selection genotype frequencies are proportional to pre-selection genotype frequencies multiplied by their relative fitness and normalized to sum to $1$, and that allele frequencies are obtained by counting alleles from genotype frequencies—compute the frequency of allele $A$ immediately after viability selection and before mating.\n\nExpress your final answer as a decimal and round to five significant figures.
