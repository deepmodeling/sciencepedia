The resulting mRNA is translated to protein. Protein function is determined by its cellular localization and interaction specificity.\n2.  **ABC Model**: B-class function from *APETALA3* (*AP3*) and *PISTILLATA* (*PI*) specifies petals in whorl $2$ (with A-class and E-class factors) and stamens in whorl $3$ (with C-class and E-class factors).\n3.  **Mutant Phenotype**: In an *ap3;pi* double mutant, whorl $2$ organs are sepals and whorl $3$ organs are carpels. Whorls $1$ and $4$ are unaffected.\n4.  **Protein Function**: B-class MADS-box proteins like AP3 and PI function as obligate heterodimers. These dimers form higher-order complexes (floral quartets) with other MADS-box proteins. Correct function requires both partners to be present in the correct whorls, at sufficient levels, and in the nucleus.\n5.  **Complementation Assay Requirements**: To infer functional conservation, readouts must include organ identity in whorls $2$ and $3$, and expression of downstream marker genes. To rule out artifacts, controls for expression level, spatial domain, copy number, and integration site are necessary.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established principles of molecular genetics and developmental biology ($i.e.$, the Central Dogma, the ABC model). The question is a formal exercise in evaluating experimental design, a critical skill in the sciences. The problem provides a clear set of foundational facts against which the options are to be judged. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies in the problem setup.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A full analysis will be performed.\n\n**Derivation of a Solution from First Principles**\nThe objective is to test for the functional equivalence of gymnosperm B-like proteins with the *Arabidopsis* AP3 and PI proteins. A rigorous experimental design must isolate the variable of interest—protein function—while controlling for all other variables, as stipulated by the foundational facts.\n\n1.  **Background Genotype**: The experiment must be conducted in an *ap3;pi* double mutant background. This provides a null state where any restoration of petal and stamen development can be unambiguously attributed to the introduced transgenes.\n2.  **Gene Expression**: Since AP3 and PI proteins are obligate heterodimers, both gymnosperm B-like genes (orthologs of *AP3* and *PI*, hereafter *GymAP3* and *GymPI*) must be co-expressed.\n3.  **Promoter Choice**: To test the conservation of protein function, one must ensure that the test proteins are expressed in the same spatiotemporal pattern as the proteins they are intended to replace. This isolates protein function from regulatory evolution. Therefore, the *GymAP3* coding sequence (CDS) should be driven by the native *Arabidopsis* AP3 promoter (`pAP3`), and the *GymPI* CDS should be driven by the native `pPI`. Using constitutive promoters ($e.g.$, $35S$) or promoters from other genes ($e.g.$, $LFY$) would introduce confounding variables and test a different hypothesis. Using the native gymnosperm promoters would test the conservation of the entire gene locus (promoter and protein), not just protein function.\n4.  **Controls**: Rigorous controls are non-negotiable.\n    *   **Positive Control**: Demonstrates that the experimental system is functional. Expressing *Arabidopsis* AP3 and PI cDNAs using the identical vector system (`pAP3::AtAP3`, `pPI::AtPI`) must rescue the mutant phenotype.\n    *   **Negative Controls**: Verify that the observed rescue is specific. This includes an empty vector control, expressing each gymnosperm gene alone (to confirm the obligate heterodimer requirement), and, for maximum rigor, a version with a mutated dimerization domain to show that protein-protein interaction is essential.\n5.  **Minimizing Artifacts**: As stated, expression artifacts must be controlled. Random T-DNA insertion leads to position effects and variable copy numbers. Using a system that targets a single-copy transgene to a defined genomic locus (\"landing pad\") or using homology-directed repair at the native locus provides the most robust control over these variables.\n6.  **Verification and Readouts**: It is insufficient to observe a gross morphological change. The rescue must be validated at multiple levels: verification of transgene expression (transcript and protein levels) and correct nuclear localization of the proteins, morphological scoring of organ identity at the tissue and cellular level ($e.g.$, conical cells on petals), and molecular scoring via the expression of known downstream target genes.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Transform an *ap3;pi* double mutant with two separate transgenes: one encoding a gymnosperm AP3-like coding sequence under the Arabidopsis AP3 promoter and one encoding a gymnosperm PI-like coding sequence under the Arabidopsis PI promoter. Use intronless complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA), add a nuclear localization signal, and target each construct to a defined genomic landing pad to obtain single-copy insertions. Generate at least $3$ independent lines per construct and combine them by crossing to coexpress the pair.

Negative controls: empty-vector lines, single-gene lines (gymnosperm AP3-like only or gymnosperm PI-like only), and a dimerization-deficient variant of one gymnosperm gene. Verify transcript and protein accumulation and nuclear localization in whorls $2$ and $3$. Score rescue by morphology (petals and stamens), petal conical cell identity, and activation of petal and stamen marker genes.**\n\nThis design is excellent. It uses the correct genetic background (*ap3;pi*), co-expresses both genes, and uses the correct native *Arabidopsis* promoters to isolate protein function. It employs a state-of-the-art method (landing pads) to control for position and copy number effects. The list of positive and negative controls is comprehensive and demonstrates a deep understanding of the biological system. The verification and scoring methods are rigorous and multi-leveled. The use of cDNA is appropriate to avoid interspecific splicing issues. The addition of an NLS is a reasonable, if potentially unnecessary, precaution.

Negative control: $35$S::GUS reporter. No requirement for coexpression of a second gymnosperm B-like gene.**\n\nThis design is fundamentally flawed. Firstly, it ignores the obligate heterodimer nature of B-class proteins by expressing only a single gene partner. Secondly, it uses a constitutive ($35S$) promoter, which creates a gain-of-function experiment, not a complementation test. This design does not test for functional substitution in the correct developmental context. Thirdly, the positive control ($35S::AG$) is irrelevant to B-class function. This experiment fails to address the scientific question properly.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Transform *ap3;pi* plants with a single gymnosperm B-like gene fused to a viral VP$16$ activation domain driven by the LEAFY (LFY) promoter to ensure early floral expression. Readout is a transcriptional reporter for AP3 or PI promoter activity in whorls $2$ and $3$. No additional controls; assume that transcriptional activation is sufficient to restore B-class function.**\n\nThis design is nonsensical for several reasons. It again incorrectly uses only a single gene. Fusing the protein to a $VP16$ activation domain does not test the protein’s native function; it tests only if the DNA-binding domain can target the artificial activator to promoters. The readout, activation of AP3 or PI promoters, is circular and does not measure the restoration of petal and stamen identity. The promoter choice ($LFY$) is not ideal. The explicit \"No additional controls\" statement is scientifically unacceptable.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Transform *ap3;pi* plants with gymnosperm B-like genes driven by their native gymnosperm promoters and terminators in a single T-DNA, with no further validation. Negative control: none. Score rescue solely by gross floral morphology.**\n\nThis design is profoundly inadequate. While using native gymnosperm promoters is a valid experiment to test the interchangeability of the entire regulatory locus, it confounds the analysis of protein function versus promoter function. More critically, the proposal includes \"no further validation\" and \"no negative control\". An experiment without controls is not an experiment; it is an anecdote. Scoring only by gross morphology is insufficient. This approach is unscientific.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Use clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated protein $9$ (Cas$9$) mediated homology-directed repair to replace the AP3 and PI coding regions in their endogenous Arabidopsis loci with gymnosperm AP3-like and PI-like coding sequences, respectively, while preserving Arabidopsis promoters, untranslated regions, and intron-exon structure where possible. Generate lines with both replacements in the *ap3;pi* background or introduce replacements in wild type and then combine with *ap3* and *pi* null alleles by crossing. Positive control: identical knock-in of Arabidopsis AP3 and PI coding sequences (recoded to be Cas$9$-resistant). Negative controls: single-gene replacement lines (only AP3-like or only PI-like replaced), and a replacement with a gymnosperm B-like dimerization-interface mutant. Verify expression and nuclear localization and assess rescue by whorl $2$ and $3$ organ identity and downstream marker gene expression.**\n\nThis design represents the contemporary gold standard for this type of functional analysis. By using CRISPR-mediated knock-in at the endogenous loci, it ensures that the gymnosperm proteins are expressed under the control of the complete, native *Arabidopsis* regulatory apparatus, including promoters, enhancers, introns, and UTRs. This is the most precise way to isolate protein function and a superior approach to random transgene insertion, even with landing pads. The proposed positive and negative controls are exceptionally well-conceived and thorough. The verification and scoring plan is rigorous. This is an exemplary experimental design.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Conclusion**\nBoth options A and E describe robust, scientifically valid, and well-controlled experimental designs to address the posed question. Option E is arguably superior as it utilizes the most advanced gene editing technology to achieve an even cleaner test of protein function by preserving the full endogenous regulatory context. However, Option A describes a classical and perfectly valid approach that also meets all the necessary scientific criteria. Options B, C, and D are fundamentally flawed and scientifically unacceptable. As the question asks to select all that apply, both A and E are correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2588100"}]}
