This robust design is essential for survival, as it allows the organism to withstand infrequent but critical high-impact loads from activities such as jumping, falling, or fighting, without catastrophic bone failure.

However, this model is a profound oversimplification. Its inadequacy in explaining biological reality is precisely what reveals the evolutionary pressures for more complex systems.\n\nThe key implications are:\n$1$. The calculation is for a *resting* state. Metabolic rate can increase by one or two orders of magnitude during activity. A safety factor of $\\approx 70$ may accommodate moderate activity but is insufficient for sustained, high-energy locomotion.\n$2$. The scaling problem is critical. Metabolic demand (demand) scales with mass (roughly as $M^{0.75}$), while diffusive supply (supply) scales with surface area (roughly as $M^{0.67}$). As an organism's size increases, demand outpaces supply, making pure diffusion a severe limiting factor on maximum body size. For a purely diffusion-limited organism, doubling its linear dimensions increases its volume (and mass) by a factor of $8$, while its surface area only increases by a factor of $4$.\n$3$. The model used a simple slab geometry. Real organisms are not simple slabs, and the internal tracheal systems are complex, tortuous, and branched, which affects the effective diffusion path length and cross-sectional area.\nThese limitations demonstrate why terrestrialization drove the evolution of more sophisticated respiratory strategies. To overcome the constraints of pure diffusion, arthropods evolved complex tracheal systems, and some larger insects even employ active ventilation (convection) by contracting abdominal muscles. Vertebrates evolved lungs, which couple a vast internal surface area with both ventilation (moving air to the exchange surface) and circulation (transporting oxygen via blood from the lungs to the tissues). These convective transport mechanisms effectively shorten the diffusion distance to the thickness of a very thin respiratory membrane, allowing for much larger body sizes and higher metabolic rates than would ever be possible with diffusion alone.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{70.4}\n$$", "id": "2614277"}, {"introduction": "On land, maintaining water balance is a relentless physiological battle against the desiccating power of the atmosphere.
