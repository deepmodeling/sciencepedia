I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the posterior probability of homology given the data, $P(H \\mid D)$. This is achieved using Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nP(H \\mid D) = \\frac{P(D \\mid H) P(H)}{P(D)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(D)$, is the total evidence, which is calculated using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(D) = P(D \\mid H) P(H) + P(D \\mid \\neg H) P(\\neg H)\n$$\nThus, the full expression for the posterior probability is:\n$$\nP(H \\mid D) = \\frac{P(D \\mid H) P(H)}{P(D \\mid H) P(H) + P(D \\mid \\neg H) P(\\neg H)}\n$$\nWe must compute the three main components: the prior probabilities $P(H)$ and $P(\\neg H)$, the likelihood under homology $P(D \\mid H)$, and the likelihood under convergence $P(D \\mid \\neg H)$.\n\nThe priors are given:\n$P(H) = h_{0} = 0.3$\n$P(\\neg H) = 1 - h_{0} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$\n\nNext, we compute the likelihood under homology, $P(D \\mid H)$. The data $D$ represents the observation of both Eda and Fgf pathways. The problem states that pathway retention events are independent. Therefore:\n$$\nP(D \\mid H) = P(\\text{Eda retained} \\mid H) \\times P(\\text{Fgf retained} \\mid H)\n$$\nUsing the given retention probabilities:\n$$\nP(D \\mid H) = r_{\\mathrm{Eda}} \\times r_{\\mathrm{Fgf}} = 0.85 \\times 0.90 = 0.765\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the likelihood under convergence, $P(D \\mid \\neg H)$. Under this hypothesis, the pathways are co-opted independently in the two lineages, and the co-option processes for Eda and Fgf are also independent. Let $D_{\\mathrm{Eda}}$ be the observation of the Eda pathway in both lineages and $D_{\\mathrm{Fgf}}$ be the observation of the Fgf pathway in both lineages. Then $D$ is the conjunction of $D_{\\mathrm{Eda}}$ and $D_{\\mathrm{Fgf}}$.\n$$\nP(D \\mid \\neg H) = P(D_{\\mathrm{Eda}} \\mid \\neg H) \\times P(D_{\\mathrm{Fgf}} \\mid \\neg H)\n$$\nFor a single pathway $p \\in \\{\\mathrm{Eda}, \\mathrm{Fgf}\\}$, the probability of co-option in a single lineage is $q_p$. Since the two lineages are independent, the probability of observing the pathway in both lineages, given a specific value of $q_p$, is $q_p \\times q_p = q_p^2$. However, $q_p$ is not a fixed value but a random variable drawn from a Beta distribution, $q_p \\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(a_p, b_p)$.

It presents a standard, albeit simplified, physics problem that is formalizable and solvable. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this problem is the constitutive law for steady, one-dimensional heat conduction, known as Fourier's Law.
