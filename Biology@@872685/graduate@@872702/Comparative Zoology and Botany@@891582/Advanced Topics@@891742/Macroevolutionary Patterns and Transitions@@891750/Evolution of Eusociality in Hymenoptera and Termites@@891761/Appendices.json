By calculating the threshold for altruism under different degrees of relatedness, you will develop a quantitative intuition for why genetic relatedness is a critical precondition for the evolution of helping behavior. This foundational practice illustrates how a simple mathematical inequality can explain a wide range of social phenomena, from cooperative breeding in birds to the emergence of sterile worker castes in insects.", "problem": "A comparative question in the evolution of social behavior: Consider a rare allele at a social locus in a large, well-mixed population that causes a worker to forego its own reproduction and instead perform a helping action directed at nestmates. Assume weak selection and additive fitness effects. Let the direct fitness cost to the actor be $c$ and the total additive fitness benefit delivered to recipients (summed over all recipients of the helping act) be $b$, both measured as expected numbers of viable gene copies transmitted to the next generation. Let $r$ denote the genetic relatedness (probability of identity by descent at the social locus) between the actor and a randomly chosen recipient of the help. Under the inclusive fitness framework, a social allele increases in frequency when the expected change in inclusive fitness due to the act is positive.\n\nStarting from the definition that inclusive fitness is the sum of the actor’s direct fitness effect and the relatedness-weighted indirect fitness effects on recipients, derive the threshold condition on the benefit-to-cost ratio $b/c$ required for the helping allele to be favored by natural selection in terms of $r$. Then, compute this minimum $b/c$ for $r=0.25$, $r=0.50$, and $r=0.75$. Finally, briefly interpret each threshold in biological terms appropriate to termites (diploid) and Hymenoptera (haplodiploid), focusing on how the magnitude of $r$ changes the stringency of the helping threshold.\n\nReport the three thresholds in the order $r=0.25$, $r=0.50$, $r=0.75$. Provide exact values; no rounding is required. The final answer must be a single row vector of the three values, as an exact analytical expression without units.", "solution": "The problem presented is a standard formulation in the study of social evolution, specifically concerning the logic of kin selection as formalized by W. D. Hamilton. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a complete derivation. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the condition under which a rare allele for altruistic helping behavior can increase in frequency. The foundation for this derivation is the concept of inclusive fitness. The change in an actor's inclusive fitness, denoted as $\\Delta W_{\\text{incl}}$, is defined as the sum of the direct fitness effect on the actor and the indirect fitness effects on all recipients, with the latter being weighted by the coefficient of genetic relatedness, $r$.\n\nThe givens are:\n- The direct fitness cost to the actor is $c$. This represents a decrease in the actor's own reproductive success. Thus, the direct fitness effect is $-c$.\n- The total additive fitness benefit conferred upon all recipients is $b$.\n- The genetic relatedness between the actor and a randomly chosen recipient of the help is $r$.\n\nThe indirect fitness component is the effect of the actor's behavior on the fitness of its relatives, weighted by how related they are. The total benefit $b$ is distributed among recipients to whom the actor is related by $r$. Therefore, the value of this benefit, from the perspective of the actor's genes, is $r \\times b$.\n\nWe can now construct the expression for the change in inclusive fitness:\n$$\n\\Delta W_{\\text{incl}} = (\\text{Direct Fitness Effect}) + (\\text{Indirect Fitness Effect})\n$$\nSubstituting the given components, we have:\n$$\n\\Delta W_{\\text{incl}} = -c + rb\n$$\nThe problem states that the social (helping) allele will be favored by natural selection and increase in frequency when the expected change in inclusive fitness is positive. This gives us the condition:\n$$\n\\Delta W_{\\text{incl}}  0\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for $\\Delta W_{\\text{incl}}$:\n$$\n-c + rb  0\n$$\nThis inequality is the core of Hamilton's rule. To find the threshold condition on the benefit-to-cost ratio, $\\frac{b}{c}$, we must rearrange this inequality. We assume $c  0$ and $r \\ge 0$, which are biologically necessary for the problem to be meaningful.\n$$\nrb  c\n$$\nSince $c$ is a positive cost, we can divide by $c$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{b}{c}  \\frac{1}{r}\n$$\nThis is the threshold condition required for the helping allele to be favored by selection. The ratio of the benefit to the recipients to the cost to the actor must exceed the inverse of the coefficient of relatedness.\n\nNow, we must compute the minimum value for this ratio for the specified values of $r$: $r=0.25$, $r=0.50$, and $r=0.75$. The minimum threshold is the value $\\frac{1}{r}$.\n\nCase 1: $r = 0.25$\nThe minimum benefit-to-cost ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{b}{c} = \\frac{1}{0.25} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{4}} = 4\n$$\n\nCase 2: $r = 0.50$\nThe minimum benefit-to-cost ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{b}{c} = \\frac{1}{0.50} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2\n$$\n\nCase 3: $r = 0.75$\nThe minimum benefit-to-cost ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{b}{c} = \\frac{1}{0.75} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{4}{3}\n$$\n\nFinally, we interpret these thresholds. The condition $\\frac{b}{c}  \\frac{1}{r}$ demonstrates that the \"price\" of altruism is inversely proportional to relatedness. As relatedness $r$ decreases, the required benefit $b$ for a given cost $c$ must be substantially higher for the behavior to be evolutionarily advantageous.\n\n- For $r = 0.75$ ($\\frac{b}{c}  \\frac{4}{3}$): This high degree of relatedness is characteristic of full sisters in haplodiploid species such as Hymenoptera (ants, bees, wasps). A female passes on half her genes to an offspring ($r=0.5$), but she shares, on average, three-quarters of her genes with a full sister ($r=0.75$). Consequently, the threshold for helping a sister ($\\frac{b}{c}  \\frac{4}{3}$) is less stringent than the threshold for raising an offspring ($\\frac{b}{c}  \\frac{1}{0.5} = 2$). This asymmetry, known as the \"haplodiploidy hypothesis,\" provides a powerful explanation for the frequent evolution of eusociality with sterile female castes in this order. A female worker can gain more inclusive fitness by helping her mother produce more sisters than by producing her own offspring.\n\n- For $r = 0.50$ ($\\frac{b}{c}  2$): This is the standard relatedness between full siblings in diploid organisms, such as termites, or between a parent and offspring in any sexually reproducing species. For altruism to evolve, the benefit to a sibling must be more than double the cost to the actor. This is a significant hurdle, but it is met in many monogamous family groups where cooperative breeding and helping at the nest have evolved.\n\n- For $r = 0.25$ ($\\frac{b}{c}  4$): This lower relatedness corresponds to half-siblings (sharing one parent), or between an individual and its nieces or nephews. The condition for altruism becomes very strict: the benefit must be more than four times the cost. This high threshold explains why altruism is much less likely to evolve when directed at more distant relatives.\n\nIn summary, the magnitude of $r$ fundamentally alters the evolutionary calculus of social behavior, with higher relatedness significantly lowering the barrier for the evolution of self-sacrificial helping. The unique genetic system of Hymenoptera creates exceptionally high relatedness among sisters, providing a strong pre-disposition for the evolution of altruistic worker castes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 4  2  \\frac{4}{3} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2570362"}, {"introduction": "Moving from abstract theory to its application, this practice challenges you to act as a field biologist classifying a newly studied insect population.

The classification must be grounded in the three fundamental criteria for defining sociality in animals: cooperative brood care, overlapping generations, and reproductive division of labor.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Study subject:** A subtropical paper wasp population.\n- **Sample:** $n=28$ nests observed over $T=14$ weeks.\n- **Cooperative Brood Care Data:** All non-ovipositing females engaged in provisioning and feeding larvae. On $25$ of $28$ nests, non-ovipositing females performed $80\\%$ of foraging.\n- **Overlapping Generations Data:** On $23$ of $28$ nests, two distinct age cohorts co-resided. On $21$ of $28$ nests, newly emerged adult daughters remained on their natal nest with an older, ovipositing female for $\\geq 3$ weeks. Genetic analysis confirmed mother-daughter pairs ($r \\approx 0.50$) on $19$ nests.\n- **Reproductive Division of Labor Data:**\n    - **Behavioral/Reproductive Skew:** On $24$ of $28$ nests, a single female laid $\\geq 0.85$ of the eggs. Genetic parentage confirmed that $90\\%$ of female brood was produced by a single female on $22$ of $28$ nests.\n    - **Physiological:** Dominant, ovipositing females had well-developed ovaries (median terminal oocyte length $2.8$ mm), while non-ovipositing females had undeveloped ovaries (median $0.4$ mm).\n    - **Worker reproduction:** A small fraction ($0.05$) of haploid males were produced by non-dominant females on $6$ nests.\n- **Caste Morphology Data:** No statistically significant size dimorphism (e.g., head width) was found between ovipositing and non-ovipositing females.\n- **Genetic Structure:** The mean pairwise relatedness among nestmate females was $\\bar{r}=0.62$. The dominant female was singly mated on most nests ($20$ of $22$).\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement provides a detailed, quantitative, and internally consistent description of a social insect population. The data points are typical of those collected in modern sociobiology research and are scientifically plausible for a species of paper wasp (e.g., genus *Polistes*), which are classic models for studying the evolution of eusociality. The question is well-posed, asking for a classification using a universally accepted biological framework. The terminology is precise and objective. There are no scientific or logical flaws, contradictions, or missing information that would prevent a rigorous analysis. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe classification of social systems, particularly in insects, is based on the presence of three key traits, as defined by C.D. Michener and E.O. Wilson:\n1.  **Cooperative Brood Care:** Individuals care for offspring that are not their own.\n2.  **Overlapping Generations:** Offspring remain at the nest and assist their parents in raising subsequent broods.\n3.  **Reproductive Division of Labor:** A reproductive caste (queens) and a largely non-reproductive worker caste exist.\n\nLet us evaluate the provided data against these three criteria.\n\n1.  **Presence of Cooperative Brood Care:** The data unequivocally confirm this criterion. The statement \"All non-ovipositing females were observed performing provisioning trips and larval feeding\" demonstrates that individuals are caring for brood. Since genetic data show that on most nests ($22$ of $28$), a single female laid over $90\\%$ of the eggs, these non-ovipositing females are, by definition, caring for offspring that are not their own (mostly their mother's offspring, i.e., their sisters). The fact that they perform the vast majority of foraging ($80\\%$) solidifies this point. **Criterion 1 is met.**\n\n2.  **Presence of Overlapping Generations:** The data provide multiple lines of evidence for this. The observation of \"2 age cohorts co-residing\" is suggestive. The mark-recapture data are definitive: \"newly eclosed females... remained at the natal nest... while an older female continued oviposition.\" This describes adult daughters coexisting with and working for their mother. The genetic finding of mother-daughter dyads ($r\\approx 0.50$) provides direct confirmation. **Criterion 2 is met.**\n\n3.  **Presence of Reproductive Division of Labor:** This is strongly supported. The oviposition data show extreme reproductive skew, with one female dominating egg-laying. This is a behavioral division of labor. Furthermore, there is a clear physiological division, evidenced by the \"pronounced differences in terminal oocyte length\" between dominant and non-ovipositing females. The latter have undeveloped ovaries, indicating reproductive suppression. The existence of a specialist foraging group (non-ovipositors) and a specialist reproductive (the dominant female) is the essence of a division of labor. The fact that some workers lay a few male eggs does not negate the division of labor; it merely indicates that worker sterility is incomplete, a common feature in primitively social species. **Criterion 3 is met.**\n\n**Synthesis:** A society that meets all three criteria—cooperative brood care, overlapping generations, and reproductive division of labor—is defined as **eusocial**.\n\nThe final step is to determine the level of eusociality.\n- **Primitively Eusocial** societies are characterized by a lack of morphological differentiation between reproductive and non-reproductive castes. Castes are determined by behavior and physiology, and caste status can be flexible.\n- **Obligate (or Advanced) Eusocial** societies exhibit distinct, irreversible morphological castes (e.g., queen and worker honeybees or ants).\n\nThe data state, \"No discrete size dimorphism was detected... (head width difference mean $\\Delta=0.12$ mm, $P0.05$)\". This explicitly rules out the presence of morphological castes. The division of labor is physiological and behavioral. Therefore, the population is best described as **primitively eusocial**.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Communal: Females share a nest site but there is no cooperative brood care; each female provisions only her own brood. The absence of morphological castes and the presence of multiple egg-layers indicate communal nesting with no reproductive division of labor.**\nThis option claims there is no cooperative brood care and no reproductive division of labor. Both claims are directly contradicted by the data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Quasisocial: Females of the same generation share a nest and cooperatively care for brood; all females reproduce. The lack of morphological castes and the occasional multiple-egg-layer nests support quasisociality without reproductive division of labor or overlapping generations.**\nThis option incorrectly claims the absence of both reproductive division of labor and overlapping generations. The data clearly demonstrate strong reproductive skew and the co-residence of mothers and adult daughters.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Semisocial: Females of the same generation share a nest and cooperatively care for brood; some specialize on reproduction while others do not, but there are no overlapping generations. The strong oviposition skew and helper foraging indicate semisociality.**\nThis option incorrectly claims there are \"no overlapping generations.\" The data explicitly show that generations do overlap.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Primitively eusocial: Cooperative brood care occurs, generations overlap (older females co-reside with their daughters), and there is a reproductive division of labor that is behavioral and physiological rather than morphological. The absence of discrete morphological castes places the system as primitively eusocial.**\nThis option correctly identifies that all three criteria for eusociality are met. It correctly classifies the system as \"primitively\" eusocial and provides the correct justification: the division of labor is not based on morphological castes, which aligns perfectly with the observation that there is \"No discrete size dimorphism... but... pronounced differences in terminal oocyte length\". This is a precise and accurate summary of the evidence.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Obligate eusocial: Cooperative brood care, overlapping generations, and irreversible morphological castes produce a permanent worker class with near-complete sterility. The high oviposition skew and low worker male production indicate obligate eusociality.**\nThis option incorrectly posits the existence of \"irreversible morphological castes.\" The data explicitly state there is no significant morphological difference between queens and workers. This is the key distinction between primitive and obligate eusociality.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2570428"}, {"introduction": "This final practice bridges the gap between theoretical models and empirical research by simulating a common task in molecular ecology.

It provides a complete and consistent dataset for a standard analysis in evolutionary genetics. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe primary task is to determine the mean pairwise relatedness, $\\bar r$, among a sample of $N=6$ worker insects from a haplodiploid species. This requires first reconstructing the patrilines (groups of full sisters) within the sample. The principle of this reconstruction rests on the genetics of Hymenoptera. A diploid female worker receives one set of chromosomes from her diploid mother (the queen) and one set from her haploid father (a male, or sire). At any given locus, a worker's genotype consists of one maternal allele and one paternal allele. Since the queen's genotype is known, the paternal allele for each worker can be deduced. All daughters of the same father must share the same paternal allele at a given locus.\n\nWe apply this principle to the provided genotypes at four unlinked microsatellite loci, $L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4$. The queen's genotype is denoted $Q$. Worker genotypes are denoted $W_i$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.

The total number of unique, unordered worker pairs is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{N}{2}$:\n$$ \\text{Total pairs} = \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15 $$\nThese $15$ pairs are of two types: full-sister pairs and half-sister pairs.\nThe problem states the coefficient of relatedness for full sisters is $r_{\\text{full}} = 0.75$, and for half-sisters is $r_{\\text{half}} = 0.25$.\n\n1.  **Number of full-sister pairs ($N_{\\text{full}}$):** These are pairs where both workers belong to the same patriline.\n    - Within Patriline 1 (size $n_1=3$): $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ pairs.\n    - Within Patriline 2 (size $n_2=3$): $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ pairs.\n    - Total full-sister pairs: $N_{\\text{full}} = 3 + 3 = 6$.\n\n2.  **Number of half-sister pairs ($N_{\\text{half}}$):** These are pairs with one worker from each patriline.\n    - Number of pairs between Patriline 1 and Patriline 2: $n_1 \\times n_2 = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n    - Alternatively, $N_{\\text{half}} = \\binom{N}{2} - N_{\\text{full}} = 15 - 6 = 9$.\n\nThe mean relatedness $\\bar r$ is the sum of the relatedness coefficients for all pairs, divided by the total number of pairs.\n$$ \\bar r = \\frac{(N_{\\text{full}} \\times r_{\\text{full}}) + (N_{\\text{half}} \\times r_{\\text{half}})}{N_{\\text{full}} + N_{\\text{half}}} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\bar r = \\frac{(6 \\times 0.75) + (9 \\times 0.25)}{15} $$\n$$ \\bar r = \\frac{4.5 + 2.25}{15} $$\n$$ \\bar r = \\frac{6.75}{15} $$\n$$ \\bar r = 0.45 $$\nThis value is the exact mean pairwise relatedness for this specific sample. It is noted that this differs from the value obtained from the general formula for large populations with a queen mated to $m$ males with equal paternity, $\\bar{r} = 0.25 + 0.5/m$. For $m=2$, that formula yields $\\bar{r}=0.5$. The discrepancy arises because the general formula is an asymptotic approximation for large populations, whereas our calculation is an exact value for a small, finite sample. The probability that a randomly chosen nestmate is a full sister for a focal worker in this sample is precisely $\\frac{n_i-1}{N-1} = \\frac{3-1}{6-1} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$, not $1/m=0.5$. Our calculation is therefore the correct one as per the problem's requirement to compute $\\bar r$ **in this sample**.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to four significant figures, is $0.4500$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4500}$$", "id": "2570379"}]}
