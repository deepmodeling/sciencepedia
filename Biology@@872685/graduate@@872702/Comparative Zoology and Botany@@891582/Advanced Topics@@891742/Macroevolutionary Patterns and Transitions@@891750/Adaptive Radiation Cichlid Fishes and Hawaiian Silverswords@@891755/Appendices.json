By working backward from present-day genetic data, you will apply fundamental principles of population genetics to estimate the time elapsed since this crucial first step, providing a timescale for the subsequent radiation [@problem_id:2544870].", "problem": "A crater-lake cichlid lineage experienced a founder event followed by isolation, analogous in tempo and mode to the colonization and diversification of Hawaiian silverswords (Argyroxiphium alliance) on newly formed volcanic substrates. You are told that genome-wide neutral heterozygosity in the cichlid prior to the bottleneck can be approximated by that of a large, panmictic source population: $H_{0} = 0.019$. A recent whole-genome survey of the isolated crater-lake population finds present-day neutral heterozygosity $H_{t} = 0.010$. Independent population-genomic inference (e.g., temporal method and linkage disequilibrium) indicates that the effective population size ($N_{e}$) during the post-bottleneck isolation has been approximately constant at $N_{e} = 420$ over the relevant interval. Assume a diploid Wright–Fisher model with random mating, neutrality, no mutation, and no migration during this interval.\n\nUsing first principles of genetic drift in a diploid Wright–Fisher population, derive a recursion for the expected neutral heterozygosity across generations, solve it in closed form, and invert it to obtain an estimator for the time since the bottleneck in generations, $t$, expressed as a function of $H_{t}$, $H_{0}$, and $N_{e}$. Then evaluate this expression numerically using the values above. Round your final numerical answer to three significant figures and express it in generations. Provide only the final numerical value of $t$ as your answer.\n\nNote: You should begin from core definitions of identity by descent and heterozygosity under drift in a diploid Wright–Fisher population and do not assume any additional processes.

We will proceed with a solution derived from first principles.\n\nLet $H_t$ represent the expected neutral heterozygosity in a diploid population at generation $t$. Heterozygosity is the probability that two alleles, drawn at random without replacement from the gene pool, are not identical. The problem specifies a diploid Wright-Fisher population of constant effective size $N_e$. The total number of alleles in the gene pool is $2N_e$.\n\nTo derive the change in heterozygosity over one generation, we consider two alleles sampled at generation $t$. We trace their ancestry to generation $t-1$. There are two mutually exclusive possibilities for their origin:\n$1$. The two alleles are copies of the *same* parental allele from generation $t-1$. In a population of $2N_e$ alleles, the probability of sampling the same ancestral allele twice (with replacement, as is the nature of the Wright-Fisher model) is $\\frac{1}{2N_e}$. In this case, the two descendant alleles are identical by descent.\n$2$. The two alleles are copies of *different* parental alleles from generation $t-1$. This occurs with probability $1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}$.\n\nIf the two alleles descend from different ancestral alleles (case $2$), they are non-identical only if their respective ancestral alleles were also non-identical. The probability that two randomly selected alleles in generation $t-1$ were non-identical is, by definition, the heterozygosity of that generation, $H_{t-1}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that two alleles drawn in generation $t$ are non-identical, $H_t$, is the product of the probability that they descend from different ancestral alleles and the probability that those ancestral alleles were themselves non-identical. The assumptions of neutrality, no mutation, and no migration ensure that only genetic drift affects allele frequencies. This gives the fundamental recurrence relation for heterozygosity under drift:\n$$ H_t = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) H_{t-1} $$\n\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous recurrence relation. Its solution can be found by iterative substitution from the initial condition $H_0$ at time $t=0$:\n$$ H_1 = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) H_0 $$\n$$ H_2 = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) H_1 = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right)^2 H_0 $$\nBy induction, the general closed-form solution for $H_t$ after $t$ generations is:\n$$ H_t = H_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right)^t $$\n\nThe task is to estimate the time $t$ since the bottleneck. To do this, we must invert the equation above to solve for $t$. We are given $H_0$, $H_t$, and $N_e$.\nFirst, rearrange the equation:\n$$ \\frac{H_t}{H_0} = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right)^t $$\nTo solve for the exponent $t$, we take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{H_t}{H_0}\\right) = \\ln\\left[ \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right)^t \\right] $$\nUsing the identity $\\ln(x^y) = y \\ln(x)$, we obtain:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{H_t}{H_0}\\right) = t \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) $$\nFinally, isolating $t$ gives the estimator as a function of the given parameters:\n$$ t = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{H_t}{H_0}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right)} $$\nThis derivation, based on the fundamental Wright-Fisher model for a diploid organism, is general.

The biomechanical model provides the following relationships for bite force $F_b$ and bite closure speed $v_b$:\n$$F_b = \\frac{F_m}{L}$$\n$$v_b = L v_m$$\nwhere $F_m$ is the muscle force, $v_m$ is the muscle shortening velocity, and $L$ is the lever ratio.\n\nThe performance requirements to handle prey $(H,E)$ are:\n$$F_b \\ge \\alpha H$$\n$$v_b \\ge \\beta E$$\nwhere $\\alpha  0$ and $\\beta  0$ are constants.\n\nSubstituting the model equations into these requirements, we obtain constraints on the muscle's output:\n$$ \\frac{F_m}{L} \\ge \\alpha H \\implies F_m \\ge \\alpha H L $$\n$$ L v_m \\ge \\beta E \\implies v_m \\ge \\frac{\\beta E}{L} $$\n\nThe muscle's force $F_m$ and velocity $v_m$ are not independent; they are constrained by the Hill force-velocity relationship:\n$$ (F_m + a)(v_m + b) = (F_{m0} + a)b $$\nwhere $F_{m0}$ is the maximum isometric force, and $a, b$ are positive Hill constants. We can solve this for $v_m$ as a function of $F_m$:\n$$ v_m(F_m) = \\frac{(F_{m0} + a)b}{F_m + a} - b = b \\left( \\frac{F_{m0} + a - (F_m + a)}{F_m + a} \\right) = \\frac{b(F_{m0} - F_m)}{F_m + a} $$\nThis relationship holds for the physically relevant range of muscle forces $0 \\le F_m \\le F_{m0}$. The function $v_m(F_m)$ is monotonically decreasing with $F_m$ for $F_m \\ge 0$, since its derivative is $\\frac{d v_m}{d F_m} = -\\frac{b(F_{m0} + a)}{(F_m + a)^2}  0$.\n\nA species can process the prey if there exists a state $(F_m, v_m)$ that simultaneously satisfies all three conditions:\n$1.$ $F_m \\ge \\alpha H L$\n$2.$ $v_m \\ge \\frac{\\beta E}{L}$\n$3.$ $v_m = v_m(F_m) = \\frac{b(F_{m0} - F_m)}{F_m + a}$\n\nWe need to find the condition on $L$ for which the set of $F_m$ satisfying these constraints is non-empty. Specifically, we need to find an $F_m$ in the range $[0, F_{m0}]$ such that $F_m \\ge \\alpha H L$ and $v_m(F_m) \\ge \\frac{\\beta E}{L}$.\n\nBecause $v_m(F_m)$ is a decreasing function of $F_m$, the inequality $v_m(F_m) \\ge \\frac{\\beta E}{L}$ is satisfied for smaller values of $F_m$. Conversely, the inequality $F_m \\ge \\alpha H L$ is satisfied for larger values of $F_m$. For a common solution for $F_m$ to exist, the velocity constraint must hold at the minimum possible force that satisfies the force constraint, which is $F_m = \\alpha H L$. If the velocity is sufficient at this force, $v_m(\\alpha H L) \\ge \\frac{\\beta E}{L}$, then any force $F  \\alpha H L$ could be chosen, but it would have a lower velocity $v_m(F)  v_m(\\alpha H L)$, making it harder to satisfy the velocity constraint. Therefore, the condition for the existence of a valid operating point $(F_m, v_m)$ on the Hill curve is simply that the point corresponding to the threshold force itself provides sufficient (or more than sufficient) velocity.\n\nSo, the condition for a given $L$ to be feasible is:\n$$ v_m(\\alpha H L) \\ge \\frac{\\beta E}{L} $$\nWe must also ensure that the required muscle force is physically attainable, i.e., $\\alpha H L \\le F_{m0}$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $v_m(F_m)$ with $F_m = \\alpha H L$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{b(F_{m0} - \\alpha H L)}{\\alpha H L + a} \\ge \\frac{\\beta E}{L} $$\nThe diet-threshold lever ratio $L^{\\ast}$ is the smallest positive $L$ that satisfies this inequality. The boundary of the solution set for this inequality is found by solving the corresponding equality:\n$$ \\frac{b(F_{m0} - \\alpha H L)}{\\alpha H L + a} = \\frac{\\beta E}{L} $$\nSince $L  0$ and all other parameters are positive, the denominator $\\alpha H L + a$ is positive.

The parabola represented by the quadratic function $y(L) = A L^2 + B L + C$ opens upwards. The inequality derived from the feasibility condition is $A L^2 + B L + C \\le 0$. For a parabola that opens upwards, this inequality is satisfied for $L$ values between its real roots. For such real, positive roots to exist, we must have the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC \\ge 0$ and the sum of roots $-B/A  0$, implying $B  0$. The condition $B  0$ translates to $\\alpha \\beta E H  b F_{m0}$, which is a physically meaningful constraint on the maximum difficulty of prey that can be consumed at all.\n\nAssuming this condition holds, there are two positive real roots, and the set of feasible $L$ values is the interval $[L_1, L_2]$, where $L_1$ is the smaller root and $L_2$ is the larger root. The problem asks for the smallest positive $L$, which is $L^{\\ast} = L_1$.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, the roots are $L = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$.
