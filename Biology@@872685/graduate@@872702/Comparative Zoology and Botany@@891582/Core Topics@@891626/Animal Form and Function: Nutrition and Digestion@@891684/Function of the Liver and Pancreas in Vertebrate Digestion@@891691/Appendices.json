It is not trivial, as it requires the correct application of the definition of buffer capacity in a dynamic system.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived from fundamental principles.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe problem requires the calculation of the total rate of bicarbonate ($\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}$) delivery needed to raise the pH of an acidic stream from an initial value to a final target value within a buffered medium. At steady state, the rate of base addition must exactly counteract the acid load and effect the required pH change.\n\nThe total requirement for base is composed of two distinct components:\n$1$. The amount of base needed to neutralize the initial load of strong acid (protons, $\\mathrm{H}^+$).\n$2$. The amount of base needed to titrate the intrinsic buffer system of the luminal milieu across the specified pH range.\n\nLet $R_{\\text{HCO}_3^-}$ be the required total molar rate of bicarbonate delivery in $\\mathrm{mmol/min}$. This rate can be expressed as the product of the volume flow rate, $V_f$, and the total molar concentration of base, $[B]_\\text{total}$, required per unit volume of the fluid.\n$$R_{\\text{HCO}_3^-} = V_f \\times [B]_\\text{total}$$\n\nWe must determine $[B]_\\text{total}$. The total concentration of base required is the sum of the base needed to neutralize the free $H^+$ and the base needed to deprotonate the buffers present in the milieu.\n\nThe change in free hydrogen ion concentration to be neutralized is $([H^+]_\\text{in} - [H^+]_\\text{out})$.\nThe initial hydrogen ion concentration is given as $[H^+]_\\text{in} = 0.1 \\ \\mathrm{mol/L}$. The corresponding initial pH is $\\text{pH}_\\text{in} = -\\log_{10}([H^+]_\\text{in}) = -\\log_{10}(0.1) = 1$.\nThe final hydrogen ion concentration is $[H^+]_\\text{out} = 10^{-\\text{pH}_\\text{out}} = 10^{-6.5} \\ \\mathrm{mol/L}$. This value is approximately $3.16 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{mol/L}$, which is negligible in comparison to $[H^+]_\\text{in}$.\nThe concentration of base required to neutralize the strong acid is essentially equal to the initial acid concentration:\n$$[B]_\\text{acid} = [H^+]_\\text{in} - [H^+]_\\text{out} \\approx [H^+]_\\text{in} = 0.1 \\ \\mathrm{mol/L}$$\n\nNext, we consider the base required to titrate the intrinsic buffer system. The problem defines the buffer capacity, $\\beta$, as the amount of strong base required per liter to change the pH by one unit. For a constant $\\beta$ over a pH range from $\\text{pH}_\\text{in}$ to $\\text{pH}_\\text{out}$, the total concentration of base consumed by the buffer system, $[B]_\\text{buffer}$, is given by the integral:\n$$[B]_\\text{buffer} = \\int_{\\text{pH}_\\text{in}}^{\\text{pH}_\\text{out}} \\beta \\, d\\mathrm{pH}$$\nSince $\\beta$ is constant, this simplifies to:\n$$[B]_\\text{buffer} = \\beta \\times (\\text{pH}_\\text{out} - \\text{pH}_\\text{in})$$\n\nThe total concentration of base required, $[B]_\\text{total}$, is the sum of these two components:\n$$[B]_\\text{total} = [B]_\\text{acid} + [B]_\\text{buffer} = ([H^+]_\\text{in} - [H^+]_\\text{out}) + \\beta \\times (\\text{pH}_\\text{out} - \\text{pH}_\\text{in})$$\n\nNow, we substitute the provided values into this expression.

The required rate of bicarbonate delivery, $R_{\\text{HCO}_3^-}$, is the product of this concentration and the volume flow rate:\n$$R_{\\text{HCO}_3^-} = V_f \\times [B]_\\text{total} = (0.01 \\ \\mathrm{L/min}) \\times (0.21 \\ \\mathrm{mol/L})$$\n$$R_{\\text{HCO}_3^-} = 0.0021 \\ \\mathrm{mol/min}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in $\\mathrm{mmol/min}$. We convert the units:\n$$R_{\\text{HCO}_3^-} = 0.0021 \\ \\mathrm{mol/min} \\times \\frac{1000 \\ \\mathrm{mmol}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{mol}} = 2.1 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/min}$$\n\nFinally, the result must be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$R_{\\text{HCO}_3^-} = 2.10 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/min}$$\nThe logic is sound: the total acid load entering the system is $0.1 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/mL} \\times 10 \\ \\mathrm{mL/min} = 1 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/min}$. This requires $1 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/min}$ of bicarbonate for direct neutralization.

It presents a standard application of acid-base chemical principles to a physiological context. All necessary parameters and definitions are provided. Therefore, a rigorous solution can be constructed.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the fraction of a monoprotic acid that is ionized, starting from fundamental principles. A generic monoprotic weak acid, denoted $\\text{HA}$, dissociates in aqueous solution according to the equilibrium:\n$$\\text{HA} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{H}^{+} + \\text{A}^{-}$$\nHere, $\\text{HA}$ is the protonated (acid) form and $\\text{A}^{-}$ is the deprotonated (conjugate base or ionized) form.\n\nThe law of mass action applied to this equilibrium gives the definition of the acid dissociation constant, $K_\\text{a}$:\n$$K_\\text{a} = \\frac{[\\text{H}^{+}] [\\text{A}^{-}]}{[\\text{HA}]}$$\nwhere $[...]$ denotes molar concentration.\n\nThe objective is to find the fraction, which we will call $\\alpha$, of the total bile acid species that exists in the ionized form, $\\text{A}^{-}$. The total concentration of the acid is the sum of the concentrations of the protonated and deprotonated forms, $[\\text{HA}] + [\\text{A}^{-}]$. The fraction $\\alpha$ is therefore defined as:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{[\\text{A}^{-}]}{[\\text{HA}] + [\\text{A}^{-}]}$$\nTo express $\\alpha$ as a function of $[\\text{H}^{+}]$ and $K_\\text{a}$, we first rearrange the $K_\\text{a}$ expression to solve for $[\\text{HA}]$:\n$$[\\text{HA}] = \\frac{[\\text{H}^{+}] [\\text{A}^{-}]}{K_\\text{a}}$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[\\text{HA}]$ into the denominator of the equation for $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{[\\text{A}^{-}]}{\\frac{[\\text{H}^{+}] [\\text{A}^{-}]}{K_\\text{a}} + [\\text{A}^{-}]}$$\nThe term $[\\text{A}^{-}]$ is present in the numerator and in both terms of the denominator. We can divide the numerator and denominator by $[\\text{A}^{-}]$ (assuming $[\\text{A}^{-}] \\neq 0$, which is true for any finite amount of acid in solution) to simplify the expression:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{\\frac{[\\text{H}^{+}]}{K_\\text{a}} + 1}$$\nRearranging the terms in the denominator gives:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[\\text{H}^{+}]}{K_\\text{a}}}$$\nThis equation relates the ionized fraction $\\alpha$ to the hydrogen ion concentration $[\\text{H}^{+}]$ and the acid dissociation constant $K_\\text{a}$.\n\nThe problem provides the definitions $pH = -\\log_{10}([\\text{H}^{+}])$ and $pK_\\text{a} = -\\log_{10}(K_\\text{a})$. We can invert these definitions to express $[\\text{H}^{+}]$ and $K_\\text{a}$ in exponential form:\n$$[\\text{H}^{+}] = 10^{-pH}$$\n$$K_\\text{a} = 10^{-pK_\\text{a}}$$\nSubstituting these into our derived expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{10^{-pH}}{10^{-pK_\\text{a}}}}$$\nUsing the property of exponents $\\frac{10^a}{10^b} = 10^{a-b}$, we simplify the fraction in the denominator:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-pH - (-pK_\\text{a})}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pK_\\text{a} - pH}}$$\nThis is the final required expression for the ionized fraction $\\alpha$ as a function of $pH$ and $pK_\\text{a}$. This relationship is a form of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nWe will now apply this formula to the two bile acids at the specified duodenal $pH$ of $6.5$.\n\nFor unconjugated cholate, the given $pK_\\text{a}$ is $5.5$. The $pH$ is $6.5$.\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{cholate}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{5.5 - 6.5}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-1.0}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.1} = \\frac{1}{1.1}$$\nCalculating this value and rounding to $4$ significant figures:\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{cholate}} \\approx 0.909090... \\approx 0.9091$$\n\nFor glycocholate (glycine-conjugated cholate), the given $pK_\\text{a}$ is $4.3$. The $pH$ is again $6.5$.\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{glycocholate}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{4.3 - 6.5}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-2.2}}$$\nTo evaluate $10^{-2.2}$, we calculate its value: $10^{-2.2} \\approx 0.00630957$.

The pair of fractions is $(0.9091, 0.9937)$.\n\nFinally, we interpret these results. The problem states that mixed micelle formation, essential for solubilizing dietary lipids, depends on anionic amphipathic bile salts. The anionic form is the deprotonated form, $\\text{A}^{-}$. Our calculations show that at the duodenal $pH$ of $6.5$, approximately $91\\%$ of unconjugated cholate is in the required anionic form, while over $99\\%$ of glycocholate is anionic. The conjugation of cholate with glycine lowers its $pK_\\text{a}$ from $5.5$ to $4.3$, making it a stronger acid. This lower $pK_\\text{a}$ ensures that the bile acid remains almost completely ionized across the physiological pH range of the duodenum. A higher fraction of ionized bile salt leads to more efficient formation of mixed micelles, thereby enhancing the digestion and absorption of fats. Unconjugated cholate, with a higher $pK_\\text{a}$, is more susceptible to protonation if the duodenal pH falls, which would decrease its effectiveness as a solubilizing agent. Thus, conjugation is a critical biochemical modification that optimizes the function of bile acids for lipid digestion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.9091 & 0.9937 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2575118"}, {"introduction": "With the duodenal environment chemically optimized, the enzymatic breakdown of macronutrients can proceed efficiently.

As substrate concentration increases, the rate increases but approaches the maximum velocity $V_\\text{max}$ asymptotically. This behavior is fundamental to enzyme-catalyzed reactions.\nThe elasticity $\\varepsilon(S)$ measures the fractional change in reaction flux for a fractional change in substrate concentration. It quantifies the sensitivity of the system to its input. Our derived expression $\\varepsilon(S) = \\frac{K_m}{K_m + S}$ shows that elasticity varies from $1$ (for $S \\ll K_m$, where the reaction is first-order and highly sensitive to $S$) to $0$ (for $S \\gg K_m$, where the reaction is zero-order and insensitive to $S$). The calculated value $\\varepsilon(1 \\text{ mM}) = 0.5$ at $S=K_m$ represents a state of intermediate sensitivity.\nIn a biological context, this has significant implications. The problem states that hepatic and pancreatic secretions maintain a stable environment, which is critical because $K_m$ and $V_\\text{max}$ are strongly dependent on factors such as pH. This highlights the integrated nature of the digestive system.\nFor vertebrate taxa, these kinetic parameters are shaped by evolutionary pressures related to diet. Herbivores, consuming large quantities of starch, would likely operate at high luminal substrate concentrations ($S \\gg K_m$). For them, the digestive flux is limited by enzyme quantity ($V_\\text{max}$), and the system is insensitive to fluctuations in starch intake (low elasticity, $\\varepsilon \\to 0$), reflecting a system built for bulk processing. Conversely, a strict carnivore with occasional starch intake might have an amylase system that typically operates at $S < K_m$, where flux is highly responsive to substrate availability (high elasticity, $\\varepsilon \\to 1$), allowing efficient capture of a scarce resource. The value $\\varepsilon = 0.5$ indicates a system operating at a point of balance between efficiency and responsiveness.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5}$$", "id": "2575063"}]}
