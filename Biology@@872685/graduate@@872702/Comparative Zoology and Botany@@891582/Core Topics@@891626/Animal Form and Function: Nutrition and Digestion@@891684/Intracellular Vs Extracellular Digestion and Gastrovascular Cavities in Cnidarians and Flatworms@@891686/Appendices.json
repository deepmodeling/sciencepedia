Consider a simplified, planar model of a flatworm of transverse width $L$ (length measured orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the branches), whose GVC forms $N$ identical, straight first-order branches aligned along the longitudinal axis and distributed uniformly across the width. Assume that the branches act as parallel nutrient sources to surrounding tissue and that, after extracellular digestion in the GVC lumen, nutrient delivery to cells is limited by diffusion across the interbranch space.

It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective problem in biophysical modeling, based on fundamental principles of diffusion and scaling analysis in biology. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for a scaling exponent $\\alpha$ that governs the relationship between the number of gastrovascular cavity branches, $N$, and the transverse width of the organism, $L$, under the constraint that the mean nutrient delivery time, $\\bar{T}$, remains constant as the organism grows. The solution is structured in three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the mean transverse distance $\\mathbb{E}[\\ell]$**\n\nWe model the flatworm's transverse cross-section as a one-dimensional space of width $L$. Within this space, there are $N$ branches of the gastrovascular cavity (GVC), which act as nutrient sources. These branches are uniformly distributed, so the center-to-center spacing between adjacent branches is $s = L/N$.\n\nDue to the uniform arrangement, we can analyze a representative interval between any two adjacent branches without loss of generality. Let these branches be located at transverse positions $x=0$ and $x=s$. A cell located at a position $x \\in [0, s]$ draws nutrients from its nearest branch. The midpoint between these branches is at $x=s/2$.\n- For a cell at position $x \\in [0, s/2]$, the nearest branch is at $x=0$, and the distance to it is $\\ell = x$.\n- For a cell at position $x \\in [s/2, s]$, the nearest branch is at $x=s$, and the distance to it is $\\ell = s-x$.\n\nThe problem states that we should consider a uniform spatial distribution of cells across the half-interval from a branch center to the midpoint. This corresponds to the domain $x \\in [0, s/2]$. The distance from a cell at position $x$ in this domain to its nearest branch (at $x=0$) is $\\ell(x) = x$.\n\nSince the cells are uniformly distributed in this interval, the probability density function (PDF), $p(x)$, for finding a cell at position $x$ is constant over the interval $[0, s/2]$. The PDF must normalize to $1$ over its domain:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{s/2} p(x) \\, dx = 1\n$$\nLet $p(x) = C_0$, where $C_0$ is the constant. The integral becomes:\n$$\nC_0 \\int_{0}^{s/2} dx = C_0 \\left( \\frac{s}{2} \\right) = 1 \\implies C_0 = \\frac{2}{s}\n$$\nSo, the PDF is $p(x) = 2/s$ for $x \\in [0, s/2]$ and $p(x) = 0$ otherwise.\n\nThe mean transverse distance, $\\mathbb{E}[\\ell]$, is the expected value of the distance function $\\ell(x) = x$ with respect to this probability distribution:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\ell] = \\int_0^{s/2} \\ell(x) p(x) \\, dx = \\int_0^{s/2} x \\left( \\frac{2}{s} \\right) \\, dx\n$$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\ell] = \\frac{2}{s} \\int_0^{s/2} x \\, dx = \\frac{2}{s} \\left[ \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_0^{s/2} = \\frac{1}{s} \\left( \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^2 - 0^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{s} \\left( \\frac{s^2}{4} \\right) = \\frac{s}{4}\n$$\nThus, the mean transverse distance is $\\mathbb{E}[\\ell] = s/4$.\n\n**Part 2: Expression for the mean delivery time $\\bar{T}$**\n\nThe diffusive delivery time to a cell at distance $\\ell$ is given by $T(\\ell) \\approx \\ell^2 / (2D)$. The mean delivery time, $\\bar{T}$, is the expectation of this quantity over the distribution of cells. A rigorous treatment requires averaging the time $T(\\ell)$ itself, not evaluating the function $T$ at the average distance $\\mathbb{E}[\\ell]$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\bar{T} = \\mathbb{E}[T(\\ell)] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{\\ell^2}{2D}\\right] = \\frac{1}{2D} \\mathbb{E}[\\ell^2]\n$$\nWe must first calculate $\\mathbb{E}[\\ell^2]$, the mean squared distance. Using the same PDF, $p(x) = 2/s$, and distance function, $\\ell(x)=x$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\ell^2] = \\int_0^{s/2} \\ell(x)^2 p(x) \\, dx = \\int_0^{s/2} x^2 \\left( \\frac{2}{s} \\right) \\, dx\n$$\nEvaluating this integral:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\ell^2] = \\frac{2}{s} \\int_0^{s/2} x^2 \\, dx = \\frac{2}{s} \\left[ \\frac{x^3}{3} \\right]_0^{s/2} = \\frac{2}{3s} \\left( \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^3 - 0^3 \\right) = \\frac{2}{3s} \\left( \\frac{s^3}{8} \\right) = \\frac{s^2}{12}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this result back into the expression for $\\bar{T}$:\n$$\n\\bar{T} = \\frac{1}{2D} \\mathbb{E}[\\ell^2] = \\frac{1}{2D} \\left( \\frac{s^2}{12} \\right) = \\frac{s^2}{24D}\n$$\nFinally, we express $\\bar{T}$ in terms of $L$, $N$, and $D$ by substituting $s = L/N$:\n$$\n\\bar{T} = \\frac{(L/N)^2}{24D} = \\frac{L^2}{24 D N^2}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of the scaling exponent $\\alpha$**\n\nThe problem requires that the mean delivery time $\\bar{T}$ remains independent of the body width $L$ as the flatworm grows. The diffusion coefficient $D$ is also stated to be a fixed constant. Based on the expression derived in Part 2:\n$$\n\\bar{T} = \\frac{L^2}{24 D N^2} = \\text{constant}\n$$\nFor this condition to hold, the entire term must be constant. Since $24$ and $D$ are constants, this implies that the ratio $L^2/N^2$ must also be a constant. Let this constant be $K$:\n$$\n\\frac{L^2}{N^2} = K\n$$\nWe rearrange this equation to find the relationship between $N$ and $L$:\n$$\nN^2 = \\frac{1}{K} L^2 \\implies N = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{K}} L\n$$\nSince $1/\\sqrt{K}$ is a constant of proportionality, this relationship shows that $N$ is directly proportional to $L$:\n$$\nN \\propto L^1\n$$\nThe problem postulates a scaling relation of the form $N \\propto L^{\\alpha}$. By comparing our derived result with this postulated form, we can identify the value of the exponent $\\alpha$.\n$$\nL^{\\alpha} = L^1 \\implies \\alpha = 1\n$$\nTherefore, to maintain a constant diffusion time for nutrients, the number of GVC branches must scale linearly with the width of the organism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2583695"}, {"introduction": "Once nutrients are liberated by extracellular digestion, they must be distributed throughout the organism.

The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}\\cdot \\nabla c = D \\nabla^{2} c\n$$\nThis equation balances the effects of advection (transport by bulk fluid motion, $\\mathbf{u}\\cdot \\nabla c$) and diffusion (transport by random molecular motion, $D \\nabla^{2} c$). To derive the Péclet number, we must compare the characteristic magnitudes of these two terms.\n\nLet $L$ be the characteristic length scale over which concentration varies significantly, and let $U$ be the characteristic velocity of the fluid. The problem specifies $L = r$.\nThe magnitude of the advection term can be estimated by dimensional analysis:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{u}\\cdot \\nabla c| \\sim U \\frac{\\Delta c}{L}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta c$ is the characteristic change in concentration over the length $L$.\n\nThe magnitude of the diffusion term is estimated similarly:\n$$\n|D \\nabla^{2} c| \\sim D \\frac{\\Delta c}{L^2}\n$$\n\nThe Péclet number, $\\mathrm{Pe}$, is defined as the dimensionless ratio of the rate of advection to the rate of diffusion.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Pe} = \\frac{|\\mathbf{u}\\cdot \\nabla c|}{|D \\nabla^{2} c|} \\sim \\frac{U \\frac{\\Delta c}{L}}{D \\frac{\\Delta c}{L^2}} = \\frac{UL}{D}\n$$\nThe problem requires a derivation from characteristic timescales. This is an equivalent, and more physically intuitive, approach.\n\nThe characteristic advective timescale, $\\tau_{adv}$, is the time required for a substance to be transported a distance $L$ by the bulk flow at speed $U$.\n$$\n\\tau_{adv} = \\frac{L}{U}\n$$\nThe characteristic diffusive timescale, $\\tau_{diff}$, is the time required for a substance to diffuse across the same distance $L$.

Since $200 \\gg 1$, solute transport within this gastrovascular canal is strongly **advection-dominated**. This means that the bulk movement of the fluid is the primary mechanism for distributing nutrients along the length of the canal.

It is based on fundamental principles of mass conservation and Fick's law. No flaws are identified. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe physical process is governed by a mass balance over a differential control volume of the tissue. For a one-dimensional system at steady state, the balance between the net rate of diffusion and the rate of consumption is expressed as:\n$$-\\frac{dJ}{dx} - q = 0$$\nwhere $J$ is the molar flux of oxygen and $q$ is the volumetric consumption rate. According to Fick's first law of diffusion, the flux is proportional to the concentration gradient:\n$$J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $C$ is the molar concentration.
