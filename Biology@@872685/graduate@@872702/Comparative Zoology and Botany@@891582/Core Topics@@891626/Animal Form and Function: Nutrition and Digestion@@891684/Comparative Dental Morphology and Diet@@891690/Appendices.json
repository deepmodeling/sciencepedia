This practice will hone your skills in both classical anatomical notation and quantitative population analysis.", "problem": "A central tool in comparative dental morphology is the dental formula, which expresses the count per side of the four tooth classes—incisors, canines, premolars, and molars—in the upper and lower jaws. By convention, the dental formula is written as $I:C:P:M / I:C:P:M$, where the numerator describes the upper jaw and the denominator describes the lower jaw; each entry denotes the number of teeth per side (left or right). It is standard to assume bilateral symmetry within individuals (left and right sides of a given jaw have the same counts for a given tooth class) and that the formula pertains to adult dentition. In comparative studies, inter-individual variation in tooth counts within a population can be modeled probabilistically, and expected totals can be derived from the dental formula framework together with the principle of linearity of expectation.\n\nConsider a hypothetical mammalian lineage adapted to a mixed feeder diet on grasses and leaves, in which the unilateral (per side) counts for each tooth class in the upper and lower jaws vary across individuals as follows. Assume that, within an individual, left and right sides match for the count of a given tooth class, and that variation across tooth classes is probabilistically independent across the population.\n\n- Upper jaw per side:\n  - Incisors $I^{U}$: $3$ with probability $0.85$, $2$ with probability $0.15$.\n  - Canines $C^{U}$: $1$ with probability $1.00$.\n  - Premolars $P^{U}$: $4$ with probability $0.60$, $3$ with probability $0.40$.\n  - Molars $M^{U}$: $3$ with probability $0.90$, $2$ with probability $0.10$.\n- Lower jaw per side:\n  - Incisors $I^{L}$: $3$ with probability $0.95$, $2$ with probability $0.05$.\n  - Canines $C^{L}$: $1$ with probability $1.00$.\n  - Premolars $P^{L}$: $3$ with probability $1.00$.\n  - Molars $M^{L}$: $3$ with probability $0.80$, $2$ with probability $0.20$.\n\nTasks:\n1) Reconstruct the modal dental formula (the most probable per-side counts for each class), in the standard notation $I:C:P:M / I:C:P:M$.\n2) Using only core definitions (per-side dental formula notation, bilateral symmetry, and additivity of counts across sides and jaws) and well-tested probabilistic rules (linearity of expectation), derive and compute the expected total number of teeth per individual in this lineage.\n\nReport only the expected total number of teeth per individual as your final numeric answer.

No logical contradictions, factual errors, or unscientific premises are present. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the minimum required tooth crown height, $H_{\\min}$, for a grazing animal, based on a lifetime wear budget model. The core principle is the Archard wear equation for three-body abrasion, which states that the volume of material removed, $V$, is proportional to the normal load, $W$, and the total sliding distance, $s_{\\text{total}}$, and inversely proportional to the hardness of the material being worn, $H$. The proportionality constant is the dimensionless wear coefficient, $K$.\n\nThe wear equation is:\n$$ V = K \\frac{W s_{\\text{total}}}{H} $$\n\nThe problem specifies that the wear coefficient, $K$, is linearly dependent on the abrasive volume fraction, $\\phi$, with a baseline proportionality constant $k_a$. Thus, we have:\n$$ K = k_a \\phi $$\nSubstituting this into the wear equation gives the total volume of tooth material, $V_{\\text{total}}$, lost over the animal's lifespan:\n$$ V_{\\text{total}} = (k_a \\phi) \\frac{W s_{\\text{total}}}{H} $$\n\nNext, we must determine the total sliding distance, $s_{\\text{total}}$, over the functional lifespan, $L$. The animal performs $C$ chewing cycles per day, with each cycle having a mean sliding distance of $s_c$. The lifespan is $L$ years, with $d_y$ days per year.\n\nThe sliding distance per day is the product of cycles per day and distance per cycle:\n$$ s_{\\text{day}} = C s_c $$\nThe total number of days in the lifespan is $d_{\\text{total}} = L d_y$.\nThe total sliding distance over the lifespan is therefore:\n$$ s_{\\text{total}} = s_{\\text{day}} \\times d_{\\text{total}} = (C s_c)(L d_y) $$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $s_{\\text{total}}$ into the equation for total volume loss:\n$$ V_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{k_a \\phi W (C s_c L d_y)}{H} $$\n\nThe problem states that this volumetric loss is distributed over a constant occlusal working area, $A$. The volume loss is manifested as a reduction in crown height, which we can call $\\Delta H_{\\text{crown}}$. The relationship is:\n$$ V_{\\text{total}} = A \\cdot \\Delta H_{\\text{crown}} $$\nThe total crown height is treated as the available wear budget. Therefore, the required height to sustain wear over the lifespan, let us call it $H_{\\text{req}}$, is equal to the total height loss, $\\Delta H_{\\text{crown}}$.\n$$ A H_{\\text{req}} = \\frac{k_a \\phi W C s_c L d_y}{H} $$\n\nSolving for the required height, $H_{\\text{req}}$, gives:\n$$ H_{\\text{req}} = \\frac{k_a \\phi W C s_c L d_y}{A H} $$\n\nFinally, the problem specifies a design safety factor, $S$, to account for variations. The minimum total crown height, $H_{\\min}$, must be this required height multiplied by the safety factor. This completes the first task.\nThe analytical expression for $H_{\\min}$ is:\n$$ H_{\\min} = S \\frac{k_a \\phi W C s_c L d_y}{A H} $$\n\nFor the second task, we evaluate this expression numerically. All parameters must be in consistent SI units (meters, kilograms, seconds, Newtons, Pascals).\nThe given parameters are:\n- $S = 1.30$ (dimensionless)\n- $k_a = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ (dimensionless)\n- $\\phi = 3.0 \\times 10^{-2}$ (dimensionless)\n- $W = 1.2 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{N}$\n- $C = 4.2 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\text{day}^{-1}$\n- $s_c = 7.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $L = 18$ years\n- $d_y = 365\\ \\text{days year}^{-1}$\n- $A = 1.20 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{mm}^{2} = 1.20 \\times 10^{2} \\times (10^{-3} \\mathrm{m})^2 = 1.20 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2$\n- $H = 3.0 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{Pa} = 3.0 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{N/m}^2$\n\nLet us substitute these values into the derived expression for $H_{\\min}$:\n$$ H_{\\min} = (1.30) \\frac{(2.5 \\times 10^{-3})(3.0 \\times 10^{-2})(1.2 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{N})(4.2 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\text{day}^{-1})(7.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m})(18\\ \\text{years})(365\\ \\text{days year}^{-1})}{(1.20 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2)(3.0 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{N/m}^2)} $$\nThe product of terms with time units $(C \\cdot L \\cdot d_y)$ results in the total number of chewing cycles over the lifespan, which is dimensionless in the context of this product with $s_c$ (distance per cycle).\nThe units in the numerator are $(\\mathrm{N}) \\cdot (\\text{day}^{-1}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{m}) \\cdot (\\text{years}) \\cdot (\\text{days year}^{-1})$, which correctly simplifies to $\\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$. The units in the denominator are $(\\mathrm{m}^2) \\cdot (\\mathrm{N/m}^2) = \\mathrm{N}$. The final unit is $\\mathrm{m}$, as expected for a height.\n\nCalculating the numerator:\nNumerator $= (1.30)(2.5 \\times 10^{-3})(3.0 \\times 10^{-2})(1.2 \\times 10^{2})(4.2 \\times 10^{4})(7.0 \\times 10^{-4})(18)(365)$\nNumerator $= (1.30)(2.5)(3.0)(1.2)(4.2)(7.0)(6570) \\times 10^{-3-2+2+4-4} = (2260048.6) \\times 10^{-3} \\approx 2260.05\\ \\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$\n\nCalculating the denominator:\nDenominator $= (1.20 \\times 10^{-4})(3.0 \\times 10^{9}) = 3.6 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{N}$\n\nNow, we compute the ratio:\n$$ H_{\\min} = \\frac{2260.05\\ \\mathrm{N \\cdot m}}{3.6 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{N}} \\approx 6.2779 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the result in millimeters, rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ H_{\\min} = (6.2779 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}) \\times \\frac{1000\\ \\mathrm{mm}}{1\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 6.2779\\ \\mathrm{mm} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$ H_{\\min} \\approx 6.28\\ \\mathrm{mm} $$\n\nRegarding the interpretation of this crown height: A \"grazer specializing on silica-rich grasses\" for a lifespan of $18$ years occupies a niche with extremely high rates of dental abrasion. Such a niche exerts strong selective pressure for high-crowned, or hypsodont, teeth. The calculated value of $H_{\\min} = 6.28\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ represents the absolute minimum wear budget required for survival under these conditions. While this value itself might seem low compared to the several centimeters of crown height seen in large hypsodont mammals like horses, it is the minimum requirement derived from the model. The implication is not that the animal is brachydont (low-crowned), but that to be a successful specialized grazer under these parameters, its dentition must be at least capable of providing this wear budget, which is a hallmark of the evolutionary trend towards hypsodonty. Therefore, the result implies the animal must possess a hypsodont or at least a significantly mesodont (medium-crowned) morphology to meet this functional demand. A brachydont animal would not survive.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.28}$$", "id": "2556002"}]}
