To resolve whether syngamy occurs internally or externally, the zoologist wishes to design a falsifiable experiment using molecular markers of sperm–egg fusion that distinguishes internal from external fertilization from first principles. The fundamental base for reasoning consists of the following well-established facts and definitions: (i) internal fertilization is defined by sperm–egg membrane fusion (syngamy) occurring within the female reproductive tract prior to oviposition; external fertilization is defined by syngamy occurring outside the female body after oviposition, typically in water; (ii) sperm–egg fusion results in transfer of sperm nuclear content into the egg cytoplasm and triggers cortical granule exocytosis and membrane incorporation events that can be probed by molecular markers; (iii) detection of male-specific deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences inside the egg cytoplasm after rigorous removal of externally adherent material is a direct molecular readout of completed fusion; (iv) experimental falsifiability requires that the procedures yield quantitatively distinct, mutually exclusive predictions for internal versus external syngamy and include controls for contamination, background signal, and time-resolved dynamics. Which of the following experimental designs best satisfies these criteria and would permit a decisive, falsifiable test?\n\nA. Collect eggs by flushing the female oviduct at two time points: immediately after mating but prior to oviposition at time $t_{\\mathrm{pre}}$, and immediately after oviposition at time $t_{\\mathrm{post}}$. For each clutch, enzymatically remove any externally adherent sperm and DNA by sequential pronase and deoxyribonuclease I treatment, confirm membrane integrity with a membrane-impermeant dye exclusion assay, then assay the eggs individually for internalized male-derived DNA using digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting male-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) partitions each sample into $n$ droplets and counts $k$ positives to estimate the fraction $k/n$ above a background threshold $\\alpha$ determined from unmated female controls. In parallel, assay tank water and vegetation swabs by quantitative PCR (qPCR; quantitative polymerase chain reaction) for sperm markers to quantify external release dynamics. Pre-register predictions: under internal syngamy, the proportion $p_{\\mathrm{pre}}$ of oviduct eggs positive for male DNA at $t_{\\mathrm{pre}}$ will be $\\gg \\alpha$, with minimal dependence on external sperm concentration; under external syngamy, $p_{\\mathrm{pre}} \\approx \\alpha$, and the proportion $p_{\\mathrm{post}}$ increases with time after oviposition and external sperm concentration. Include negative controls (unmated females) and positive in vitro controls (eggs exposed to known male sperm externally). Use $N \\geq 3$ replicate pairs.\n\nB. Without handling eggs, sample tank water for an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) against a conserved sperm surface protein at $t = 0$ (before mating), $t = 10$ minutes, and $t = 60$ minutes after mating. If ELISA detects sperm proteins in the water at $t = 10$ minutes or $t = 60$ minutes, infer external fertilization; if not, infer internal fertilization. Do not collect eggs or apply decontamination steps to avoid disturbing natural behavior.\n\nC. Incubate mated females in water containing a membrane fusion–reporter dye that fluoresces upon lipid mixing at low pH. After oviposition, scan eggs on vegetation for fluorescence. If eggs fluoresce, infer external fertilization; if not, infer internal fertilization. Do not include unmated controls, because the dye reports only bona fide fusion events.\n\nD. Perform behavioral observations under infrared illumination to quantify clasp duration and proximity. If the male maintains contact for longer than $t = 120$ seconds, infer internal fertilization; if less than $t = 120$ seconds, infer external fertilization. Validate the inference by checking early cleavage stages in eggs laid within $t = 2$ hours; do not use molecular assays because microscopy of cleavage is sufficient.\n\nE. Genotype embryos at the $4$–$8$ cell stage from eggs collected $t = 24$ hours post-mating to confirm paternity using microsatellite markers, and infer internal fertilization if embryos match the mate. To ensure naturalistic conditions, do not manipulate or time-resolve pre- and post-oviposition eggs; rely solely on embryo genotypes and behavioral notes.\n\nSelect the option that yields mutually exclusive, testable predictions directly tied to sperm–egg fusion inside versus outside the female, minimizes confounds from adherent external sperm, and includes quantitative controls enabling falsification of either hypothesis.", "solution": "To satisfy the given criteria, an ideal experiment must directly probe for the defined molecular event of syngamy—the presence of male DNA *within* the egg ooplasm—at the critical time points that differentiate the two hypotheses.\n\n1.  **Hypothesis of Internal Fertilization:** Fertilization occurs *before* oviposition. Therefore, eggs still within the female's oviduct ($t_{\\mathrm{pre}}$) should already contain male DNA.\n2.  **Hypothesis of External Fertilization:** Fertilization occurs *after* oviposition. Therefore, eggs within the female's oviduct ($t_{\\mathrm{pre}}$) should be unfertilized and lack male DNA. Fertilization, and thus the appearance of internal male DNA, would only begin in eggs sampled *after* they are laid ($t_{\\mathrm{post}}$) and exposed to sperm in the external environment.\n\nA robust experimental design must therefore incorporate the following elements:\n- **Temporal Sampling:** Collection of eggs from both *inside* the female's reproductive tract (pre-oviposition) and *after* laying (post-oviposition).\n- **Confound Control:** A critical confound is the presence of non-fused sperm adhering to the external surface of the egg. A rigorous decontamination procedure to remove external DNA is mandatory before assessing the egg's internal contents.\n- **Direct and Quantitative Assay:** A sensitive and quantitative method to detect male-specific DNA within the egg cytoplasm, as specified by the problem's definition of a direct readout.\n- **Appropriate Controls:** Negative controls (e.g., eggs from unmated females) are essential to establish the baseline or background signal ($\\alpha$) of the assay. Positive controls (e.g., in vitro fertilized eggs) are necessary to validate that the detection method is functional.\n\nThis framework allows for the formulation of mutually exclusive, falsifiable predictions:\n- **Prediction for Internal Fertilization:** The proportion of positive eggs at $t_{\\mathrm{pre}}$ will be significantly greater than the background level $\\alpha$.\n- **Prediction for External Fertilization:** The proportion of positive eggs at $t_{\\mathrm{pre}}$ will be approximately equal to the background level $\\alpha$.\n\nAny proposed experimental design must be evaluated against this logical structure.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Collect eggs by flushing the female oviduct...**\nThis option proposes a design that aligns perfectly with the principles derived above.\n- **Temporal Sampling:** It correctly samples eggs at two distinct and relevant time points: pre-oviposition ($t_{\\mathrm{pre}}$, from the oviduct) and post-oviposition ($t_{\\mathrm{post}}$).\n- **Confound Control:** It includes a rigorous decontamination protocol (pronase and deoxyribonuclease I treatment) to eliminate externally adherent sperm and DNA, which is a critical step to avoid false positives. It further includes a quality control step (membrane integrity assay) to ensure the decontamination process does not compromise the eggs.\n- **Direct and Quantitative Assay:** It uses digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), a highly sensitive and quantitative method, to detect internalized male-specific DNA, directly addressing the core question of syngamy.\n- **Appropriate Controls:** It includes negative controls (unmated females) to determine the background signal threshold $\\alpha$, positive controls (in vitro fertilization), and replication ($N \\geq 3$). It also wisely suggests monitoring the environment (tank water, vegetation) for sperm presence.\n- **Falsifiable Predictions:** It explicitly formulates the correct, mutually exclusive predictions: for internal syngamy, $p_{\\mathrm{pre}} \\gg \\alpha$; for external syngamy, $p_{\\mathrm{pre}} \\approx \\alpha$.\n\nThis design is comprehensive, rigorous, and directly tests the hypotheses according to all the rules laid out in the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Without handling eggs, sample tank water for an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)...**\nThis option is flawed because it relies on an indirect correlate, not a direct measurement of syngamy. The presence of sperm in the water column is not sufficient to prove external fertilization. Many species with internal fertilization may still release sperm into the environment. Conversely, the absence of detectable sperm does not definitively prove internal fertilization; it could be due to efficient transfer or assay insensitivity. This method fails to determine *where* fertilization occurs, which is the central question. It does not probe the egg itself and thus cannot satisfy criterion (iii).\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Incubate mated females in water containing a membrane fusion–reporter dye...**\nThis design is fundamentally flawed. First, it proposes not including unmated controls, which is a violation of sound experimental design and criterion (iv) for establishing background signal. Second, the dye is in the external medium, so it can only report fusion events that happen externally. It provides no means to detect internal fertilization, which would occur prior to the egg's exposure to the dye. A negative result (no fluorescence) is an absence of evidence for external fertilization, not evidence of absence. The design is one-sided and cannot decisively distinguish between the two hypotheses.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Perform behavioral observations under infrared illumination...**\nThis option abandons direct molecular evidence in favor of a behavioral proxy (clasp duration). The link between clasp duration and fertilization mode is correlational at best and not a fundamental mechanistic proof. A specific time threshold like $t = 120$ seconds is arbitrary without prior validation. Furthermore, its \"validation\" method—observing early cleavage—is non-informative for this question. Cleavage confirms that fertilization *occurred*, but it provides no information as to *where* (internally or externally) it occurred. This design fails to directly test the location of syngamy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Genotype embryos at the $4$–$8$ cell stage...**\nThis option confuses paternity analysis with the mechanism of fertilization. Genotyping an embryo confirms its parentage but, like observing cleavage, provides no information about the location or timing of the fertilization event relative to oviposition. Fertilization could have happened internally or externally, and the resulting embryo would have the same genotype. The explicit choice to \"not manipulate or time-resolve\" the samples is a direct violation of the principles required for a falsifiable test as outlined in the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nIn conclusion, Option A is the only experimental design that is scientifically rigorous, directly addresses the question using the specified molecular definition of syngamy, incorporates the necessary controls and temporal resolution, and formulates clear, falsifiable predictions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2573635"}]}
