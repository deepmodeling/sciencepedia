Assume circular symmetry of the root perimeter and the endodermis boundary, and approximate each observed aerenchyma lacuna as a circle with an equivalent radius measured from segmentation. Tissue categories are defined anatomically as follows: the epidermis is the outermost continuous layer; the cortex is the parenchymatous region between the inner limit of the epidermis and the endodermis; the stele (vascular cylinder) is the region interior to the endodermis; aerenchyma refers to air-filled lacunae within the cortex.

Consider two roots (one monocot, one eudicot) modeled as long cylinders with azimuthal symmetry. The cortex is represented as an annulus extending from an outer radius (the epidermis) at $r=R$ to an inner absorbing boundary at $r=a$ (the endodermis–stele interface), where the solute concentration is effectively zero due to rapid loading into the xylem. The soil in contact with the epidermis maintains a fixed solute concentration $c(R)=c_{s}$. Assume steady state, no solute production or consumption within the cortex, and a spatially uniform effective diffusivity $D$ within each cortex.

It provides a standard biophysical model for diffusion in a simplified root geometry with sufficient information to determine a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe transport of solute through the root cortex is governed by the steady-state diffusion equation in cylindrical coordinates. Given a constant effective diffusivity, $D$, the equation is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r D \\frac{dc}{dr}\\right) = 0 $$\nSince $D$ is a non-zero constant and the radial coordinate $r$ is non-zero within the domain of interest ($a \\le r \\le R$), this equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\frac{dc}{dr}\\right) = 0 $$\nIntegrating this equation once with respect to $r$ yields:\n$$ r \\frac{dc}{dr} = C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration.
