The numerical values provided are physically plausible for such a biological system. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific fact. The problem will now be solved.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the fractional receptor occupancy, $f$, in terms of the free gibberellin concentration, $[G]$, and the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$.\n\nWe begin with the provided definitions:\nThe fractional occupancy is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the bound receptor complex, $[RG]$, to the total receptor concentration, $[R]_T$.\n$$f = \\frac{[RG]}{[R]_T}$$\n\nThe total receptor concentration is the sum of the concentrations of the free receptor, $[R]$, and the bound receptor complex, $[RG]$.\n$$[R]_T = [R] + [RG]$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]_T$ into the equation for $f$ gives:\n$$f = \\frac{[RG]}{[R] + [RG]}$$\n\nTo express $f$ in terms of $[G]$ and $K_d$, we must eliminate $[R]$ from this equation. We use the definition of the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[G][R]}{[RG]}$$\n\nFrom this definition, we can solve for the concentration of the free receptor, $[R]$:\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_d [RG]}{[G]}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ back into the equation for $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{[RG]}{\\left(\\frac{K_d [RG]}{[G]}\\right) + [RG]}$$\n\nThe term $[RG]$ is common to all terms in the expression. We can factor $[RG]$ out of the denominator:\n$$f = \\frac{[RG]}{[RG] \\left(\\frac{K_d}{[G]} + 1\\right)}$$\n\nAssuming a non-trivial case where $[G] > 0$ and $[R]_T > 0$, it follows that $[RG] > 0$. We can therefore cancel the $[RG]$ term from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[G]} + 1}$$\n\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $[G]$:\n$$f = \\frac{1 \\cdot [G]}{\\left(\\frac{K_d}{[G]} + 1\\right) \\cdot [G]} = \\frac{[G]}{K_d + [G]}$$\n\nThis is the required expression for the fractional receptor occupancy, $f$, in terms of $[G]$ and $K_d$.
