Assume a large population where $k$ equally effective `$S$-alleles` segregate (no dominance, all alleles enforce incompatibility symmetrically). A focal maternal plant has diploid `$S$-genotype` $S_{a}/S_{b}$ with $a \\neq b$. This plant receives a large mixed pollen cloud whose `$S$-allele` composition is characterized by the allele frequency vector $\\mathbf{p} = (p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots, p_{k})$, where $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_{i} = 1$.

Your final answer must be a single analytic expression.", "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution. The model described is a standard representation of Gametophytic Self-Incompatibility (GSI) in population genetics.\n\nThe task is to find the expected proportion of compatible pollen grains arriving at a focal maternal plant with the genotype $S_{a}/S_{b}$, where $a \\neq b$. The pollen cloud is characterized by an allele frequency vector $\\mathbf{p} = (p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots, p_{k})$ for $k$ distinct `$S$-alleles`, where $p_{i}$ is the frequency of the $S_{i}$ allele and $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_{i} = 1$.\n\nLet us consider a single pollen grain arriving at the stigma of the focal plant. The identity of the `$S$-allele` carried by this pollen grain is a random variable. The sample space of possible alleles is $\\{S_{1}, S_{2}, \\ldots, S_{k}\\}$. Based on the problem statement, the probability that a randomly chosen pollen grain carries the allele $S_{i}$ is given by its frequency in the pollen cloud, $p_{i}$.\n\nThe GSI rule for compatibility is explicitly stated: a pollen grain carrying allele $S_{i}$ is compatible if and only if its allele does not match either of the two alleles present in the maternal diploid style. For the maternal plant with genotype $S_{a}/S_{b}$, this means a pollen grain with allele $S_{i}$ is compatible if and only if $i \\notin \\{a, b\\}$.\n\nLet $C$ be the event that a single, randomly selected pollen grain is compatible. We are asked to find the expected proportion of compatible pollen, which, by the law of large numbers for a large pollen cloud, is equivalent to the probability of this event, $P(C)$.\n\nWe can calculate $P(C)$ by considering the complementary event, $C'$, which is the event that a pollen grain is incompatible. A pollen grain is incompatible if its `$S$-allele` matches one of the maternal alleles. This means a pollen grain carrying allele $S_{i}$ is incompatible if $i \\in \\{a, b\\}$.\n\nThe event $C'$ corresponds to the pollen grain carrying either allele $S_{a}$ or allele $S_{b}$. Since a single pollen grain is haploid and can carry only one `$S$-allele`, the events of carrying $S_{a}$ and carrying $S_{b}$ are mutually exclusive. Therefore, the probability of the pollen being incompatible is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n$$P(C') = P(\\text{pollen is } S_{a}) + P(\\text{pollen is } S_{b})$$\nFrom the problem definition, the probabilities of encountering pollen with alleles $S_{a}$ and $S_{b}$ are their frequencies in the pollen cloud, which are $p_{a}$ and $p_{b}$, respectively.\n$$P(C') = p_{a} + p_{b}$$\nThe event of being compatible, $C$, is the complement of the event of being incompatible, $C'$. The probabilities of complementary events must sum to $1$.\n$$P(C) + P(C') = 1$$\nTherefore, the probability that a pollen grain is compatible is:\n$$P(C) = 1 - P(C')$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(C')$, we obtain:\n$$P(C) = 1 - (p_{a} + p_{b})$$\nThis expression can be written as:\n$$P(C) = 1 - p_{a} - p_{b}$$\nThis probability represents the expected proportion of pollen grains from the cloud that will be compatible with the $S_{a}/S_{b}$ maternal plant. This is the closed-form expression required.\n\nAlternatively, we can arrive at the same result by directly summing the probabilities of all compatible outcomes. The compatible alleles are all alleles $S_{i}$ such that $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\} \\setminus \\{a, b\\}$. The probability of compatibility is the sum of the frequencies of all such compatible alleles:\n$$P(C) = \\sum_{i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\} \\setminus \\{a, b\\}} p_{i}$$\nWe know that the sum of all allele frequencies is $1$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_{i} = 1$$\nThis sum can be partitioned into the sum over compatible alleles and the sum over incompatible alleles:\n$$\\left( \\sum_{i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\} \\setminus \\{a, b\\}} p_{i} \\right) + \\left( \\sum_{i \\in \\{a, b\\}} p_{i} \\right) = 1$$\nSince $a \\neq b$, the sum over the incompatible alleles is simply $p_{a} + p_{b}$. So,\n$$P(C) + (p_{a} + p_{b}) = 1$$\nRearranging this equation gives the same result as before:\n$$P(C) = 1 - p_{a} - p_{b}$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the expected proportion of compatible pollen.

We proceed directly to the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to compute the expected number of compatible mates for a focal pollen donor of genotype $S_{2}/S_{4}$ from a recipient pool of size $M=160$. The expected number, $E$, is given by the product of the number of trials, $M$, and the probability of success in a single trial, $P_{compat}$.

Determine the expressed specificity of the pollen from the focal donor.\n2.  Determine the probability, $P_{compat}$, that a randomly chosen recipient is compatible.\n3.  Compute the final expected value, $E$.\n\n**Stage 1: Focal Pollen Specificity**\nThe focal pollen donor has genotype $S_{2}/S_{4}$. The phenotype of pollen is sporophytically determined by the diploid genotype of the parent plant. The expressed pollen specificity is given by the entry $D^{(p)}_{ij}$ of the pollen dominance matrix $D^{(p)}$ for a parent with genotype $S_{i}/S_{j}$. For the focal donor $S_{2}/S_{4}$, the relevant entry is $D^{(p)}_{24}$.\n$$\nD^{(p)}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\\\n1 & 2 & 2 & 2\\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 & 3\\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFrom this matrix, we find $D^{(p)}_{24} = 2$. Therefore, the pollen produced by the $S_{2}/S_{4}$ donor expresses the $S_{2}$ specificity.\n\n**Stage 2: Probability of a Compatible Mating**\nAccording to the sporophytic self-incompatibility (SSI) rule provided, a pollen grain is rejected if its specificity matches at least one specificity expressed in the recipient's stigma. Consequently, a mating is compatible if and only if the recipient's stigma does *not* express the focal pollen's specificity. In this case, the recipient's stigma must not express the $S_{2}$ specificity.\n\nThe specificities expressed by a stigma of genotype $S_{i}/S_{j}$ are given by the indicator vector $D^{(s)}_{ij}$.
