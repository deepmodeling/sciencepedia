Let the volumetric water flux across the seed coat be proportional to the hydraulic permeability and the water potential difference.\n\nDefine the water content of the seed as $W(t) = m_w(t)/m_d$, where $m_w(t)$ is the mass of water in the seed at time $t$ and $m_d$ is the dry mass of the seed.

The constant $R$ can be factored out.\n$$\\frac{dW}{ds} = R \\frac{d}{ds} \\left[ \\frac{1 - \\exp(-k s)}{s} \\right]$$\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation, where $u(s) = 1 - \\exp(-k s)$ and $v(s) = s$:\n$u'(s) = k \\exp(-k s)$ and $v'(s) = 1$.\n$$\\frac{dW}{ds} = R \\left[ \\frac{s \\cdot (k \\exp(-k s)) - (1 - \\exp(-k s)) \\cdot 1}{s^2} \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{dW}{ds} = \\frac{R}{s^2} \\left[ k s \\exp(-k s) - 1 + \\exp(-k s) \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{dW}{ds} = \\frac{R}{s^2} \\left[ (1 + k s) \\exp(-k s) - 1 \\right]$$\nTo find critical points (potential interior optima), we set the derivative to zero: $\\frac{dW}{ds} = 0$. Since $R/s^2  0$ for $s0$, this requires:\n$$(1 + k s) \\exp(-k s) - 1 = 0$$\n$$(1 + k s) = \\exp(k s)$$\nLet us analyze the equation $1+x = \\exp(x)$, where $x = ks$. Consider the function $f(x) = \\exp(x) - x - 1$. We are looking for the roots of $f(x)=0$. The derivative is $f'(x) = \\exp(x) - 1$. Setting $f'(x)=0$ gives $\\exp(x)=1$, which implies $x=0$. The second derivative is $f''(x) = \\exp(x)$, so $f''(0) = 1  0$, indicating that $x=0$ is a local minimum. As this is the only critical point, it is a global minimum. The minimum value is $f(0) = \\exp(0) - 0 - 1 = 0$.\nThus, the equation $f(x)=0$ has a unique solution at $x=0$. This corresponds to $ks=0$, which, given $k  0$, implies $s = 0$.\n\nHowever, the domain of biologically viable seeds is restricted to $s \\ge s_{\\min}  0$. There are no critical points within the interior of the domain $(s_{\\min}, \\infty)$. The optimum must therefore lie on the boundary.\n\nTo determine if it is a maximum, we must examine the sign of the derivative $\\frac{dW}{ds}$ for $s  0$. The sign is determined by the term $g(s) = (1 + k s) \\exp(-k s) - 1$.\nAs established, the function $f(x) = \\exp(x) - x - 1$ has a global minimum of $0$ at $x=0$ and is positive for all $x \\ne 0$. This means for $x  0$, we have $\\exp(x)  1+x$.

Therefore, the term $g(s) = (1+ks)\\exp(-ks) - 1$ is always negative for all $s  0$.\nThis implies that $\\frac{dW}{ds}  0$ for all $s$ in the domain $[s_{\\min}, \\infty)$. A function with a strictly negative derivative is strictly decreasing. The maximum of a strictly decreasing function on a domain $[s_{\\min}, \\infty)$ occurs at the lowest possible value, which is the boundary point $s = s_{\\min}$.\nTherefore, the optimal seed mass is a boundary solution:\n$$s^{\\ast} = s_{\\min}$$\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Computations\nGiven the parameters $R = 3.57 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{mg}$, $k = 0.62\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$, and $s_{\\min} = 1.23\\ \\mathrm{mg}$.\n\nThe optimal seed mass $s^{\\ast}$ is:\n$$s^{\\ast} = s_{\\min} = 1.23\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as instructed:\n$$s^{\\ast} = 1.230\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe corresponding seed number at the optimum, $n^{\\ast}$, is:\n$$n^{\\ast} = \\frac{R}{s^{\\ast}} = \\frac{3.57 \\times 10^{3}}{1.23} \\approx 2902.439024...$$\nRounding to four significant figures:\n$$n^{\\ast} = 2902$$\n\n### Part 3: Sensitivity Analysis\nWe are asked to compute the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial n^{\\ast}}{\\partial k}$ evaluated at the optimum, $s = s^{\\ast}$. The number of seeds at the optimum is denoted by $n^{\\ast}$.\nFrom Part 1, we determined that the optimal seed mass $s^{\\ast}$ is given by $s^{\\ast} = s_{\\min}$. The value of $s_{\\min}$ is a fixed lower bound, a constant that does not depend on the parameter $k$.\nTherefore, the optimal seed number is:\n$$n^{\\ast}(k) = \\frac{R}{s^{\\ast}} = \\frac{R}{s_{\\min}}$$\nThis expression for the optimal seed number $n^{\\ast}$ is independent of $k$.
