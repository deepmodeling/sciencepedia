Consider a single locule containing $N$ microspores that are equivalent in size and surface properties. Over the pre-dehiscence window of duration $\\tau$, the tapetum secretes tryphine into the locular lumen at a constant rate $q$ (mass per time). Assume the following: the locule is well mixed, there are no competing sinks or losses (no volatilization, no irreversible wall adsorption), and by the time of dehiscence all secreted tryphine has been taken up by the $N$ grains, with each grain receiving an equal share due to symmetry.\n\nUsing conservation of mass as the fundamental starting point, derive an expression for the expected mean mass of tryphine per grain at dehiscence in terms of $q$, $N$, and $\\tau$. Express your final answer as a simplified symbolic expression; no numerical evaluation is required.\n\nThen, using first principles of mass conservation and scaling arguments for thin-film capillary-mediated adhesion at the stigma contact, discuss qualitatively how variations in $q$ would be expected to alter initial pollen adhesion strength and whether diminishing returns might occur as the coat thickens. No numerical answer is required for this discussion.", "solution": "The fundamental basis is conservation of mass applied to tapetal secretion and subsequent partitioning onto the microspores.\n\nDefine $M(t)$ as the cumulative mass of tryphine secreted into the locule by time $t$. The secretion is at a constant rate $q$ (mass per time), so the production rate satisfies\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = q.\n$$\nIntegrating from $t=0$ to $t=\\tau$ with the initial condition $M(0)=0$ gives\n$$\nM(\\tau) = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} q \\, dt = q \\tau.\n$$\nUnder the stated assumptions of a well-mixed compartment, no losses, and symmetry among grains, the total secreted mass $M(\\tau)$ is entirely partitioned among the $N$ grains with equal allocation. Therefore, the mean mass per grain, $m_{\\mathrm{grain}}$, is\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{grain}} = \\frac{M(\\tau)}{N} = \\frac{q \\tau}{N}.\n$$\nThis is the required symbolic expression.\n\nQualitative discussion of how variations in $q$ alter adhesion: Pollen adhesion on the stigma immediately post-contact is strongly influenced by the presence of a viscous, lipidic film that mediates capillary bridging and wetting of the contact. Let $m_{\\mathrm{grain}}$ denote the total coat mass borne by a grain at dehiscence and let $A_{c}$ be an effective contact area relevant to the initial interface with the stigma. A minimal scaling argument posits that the local film thickness $h$ in the contact zone scales as\n$$\nh \\sim \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{grain}}}{A_{c}},\n$$\nprovided that the coat can redistribute over the contact on the relevant timescale. In the thin-film capillary regime where the adhesive contribution is proportional to the film thickness (because the Laplace pressure and wetted area grow monotonically with $h$ before saturation), a representative adhesion metric such as the peak detachment force $F_{\\mathrm{ad}}$ scales as\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{ad}} \\propto h \\propto \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{grain}}}{A_{c}} \\propto \\frac{q \\tau}{N A_{c}}.\n$$\nThus, increasing $q$ increases $m_{\\mathrm{grain}}$ linearly, which increases $h$ and thereby increases initial adhesion strength linearly within this thin-film regime. However, as $h$ becomes comparable to intrinsic roughness or asperity amplitudes of the interacting surfaces, or as the contact approaches complete wetting, the incremental gains in capillary pressure and wetted area diminish. Beyond this crossover, additional increases in $q$ (and hence in $m_{\\mathrm{grain}}$) yield diminishing returns in $F_{\\mathrm{ad}}$, and for sufficiently thick coats other effects (e.g., lubrication reducing solid-solid contributions, gravitational sag, or flow-mediated drainage) may even reduce net adhesion. Therefore, while $F_{\\mathrm{ad}}$ is expected to increase approximately linearly with $q$ at low $q$, a sigmoidal or saturating response is anticipated at higher $q$ because $h$ eventually exceeds the thin-film, roughness-limited regime.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{q \\tau}{N}}$$", "id": "2602385"}, {"introduction": "The astonishingly rapid and directed growth of a pollen tube relies on a finely controlled internal guidance system, a key component of which is a sharp gradient of free calcium ions ($\\text{Ca}^{2+}$) at the very tip.

We begin with the fundamental principle of conservation of mass.\n\nConsider a one-dimensional system along the axis $x$, where $x \\ge 0$. Let us examine an infinitesimal cylindrical volume element of the pollen tube between $x$ and $x + \\Delta x$ with a constant cross-sectional area $A$. The total amount of free calcium in this volume element is $A \\cdot \\Delta x \\cdot C(x,t)$. The rate of change of this amount over time is given by:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} [A \\cdot \\Delta x \\cdot C(x,t)] = A \\cdot \\Delta x \\cdot \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} $$\nThis change is due to two processes: the net flux of calcium into the volume element and the removal of calcium by buffering.\n\nThe flux of calcium, denoted by $J(x,t)$, is governed by Fick's first law of diffusion:\n$$ J(x,t) = -D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} $$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. The rate of calcium entering the volume at $x$ is $A \\cdot J(x,t)$, and the rate of calcium leaving at $x + \\Delta x$ is $A \\cdot J(x+\\Delta x, t)$. The net rate of change due to flux is thus:\n$$ A \\cdot J(x,t) - A \\cdot J(x+\\Delta x, t) $$\n\nThe problem states that calcium is removed through an effective first-order process with a rate constant $k$. This represents the rapid binding to immobile buffers. The rate of removal within the volume element is proportional to the concentration $C(x,t)$ and the volume $A \\cdot \\Delta x$. The total removal rate is:\n$$ k \\cdot C(x,t) \\cdot (A \\cdot \\Delta x) $$\n\nThe conservation of mass dictates that the rate of change of the amount of substance must equal the net influx minus the rate of removal.

The characteristic spatial decay length scale, which we will denote as $L$, is the distance over which the concentration falls to $1/e$ of its initial value.
