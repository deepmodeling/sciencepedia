We may proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe Reynolds number, denoted $Re$, is a dimensionless quantity in fluid mechanics that quantifies the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces within a fluid. For internal flow through a cylindrical conduit, it is defined as:\n$$Re = \\frac{\\rho v L}{\\mu}$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $v$ is the mean velocity of the flow, $L$ is the characteristic linear dimension, and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nThe problem provides the following parameters:\n- Fluid density: $\\rho = 1025\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m}^{-3}$\n- Fluid dynamic viscosity: $\\mu = 1.05 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\,s}$\n- Mean axial speed: $v = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm\\,s}^{-1}$\n- Canal diameter (characteristic length): $d = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n\nBefore calculation, all parameters must be converted to a consistent system of units, specifically the International System of Units (SI).

Since our calculated value of $Re \\approx 0.0488$ is orders of magnitude below this threshold, the flow is unequivocally laminar.\n\nThe physical interpretation of a small Reynolds number ($Re \\ll 1$) is that viscous forces are dominant over inertial forces. This is consistent with the biology of sponge filtration, where slow, non-turbulent flow is necessary for choanocytes to efficiently capture food particles from the water column. The fluid behaves as if it is highly viscous, and any disturbances are quickly damped out, preventing the formation of eddies and turbulence.

This regulation is primarily achieved via protein channels and transporters located in the apical and basolateral membranes, which constitutes the transcellular pathway. The paracellular pathway, through the intercellular junctions, acts as an unregulated shunt.\n\nThe diagnostic index $D = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{para}}}{R_{\\mathrm{trans}}}$ directly compares the electrical resistance of the unregulated shunt pathway ($R_{\\mathrm{para}}$) to the potentially regulated transcellular pathway ($R_{\\mathrm{trans}}$).\n- If $D \\ll 1$, then $R_{\\mathrm{para}} \\ll R_{\\mathrm{trans}}$. This signifies a \"leaky\" epithelium. The path of least resistance is overwhelmingly between the cells. Any attempt by the cell to regulate transport is futile, as the vast majority of ion flow simply bypasses the cell. The sponge pinacoderm, with $D^{(\\mathrm{sp})} = 35/2965 \\approx 0.012$, is a classic example. It does not form an effective ionic barrier.\n- If $D$ is of order $1$ or greater ($D \\gtrsim 1$), then $R_{\\mathrm{para}} \\gtrsim R_{\\mathrm{trans}}$. This signifies a \"tight\" epithelium. The paracellular resistance is substantial, forcing a significant fraction of ion flow to pass through the cells. This allows the cellular transport machinery to effectively control the overall transepithelial flux. Such a layer can maintain steep electrochemical gradients and perform vectorial transport, the hallmarks of a true, physiologically active epithelium. The cnidarian tissue, with $D^{(\\mathrm{cni})} = 2/3 \\approx 0.67$, shows a much greater degree of paracellular sealing than the sponge, indicative of a more advanced, genuine epithelium with true barrier function.

Consider laboratory feeding assays in which each organism is exposed to a homogeneous suspension of identically sized, neutrally buoyant, non-motile tracer particles (for example, heat-killed microalgal cells) at measured particle concentration $C$ (particles mL$^{-1}$).
