A unique, stable, and meaningful solution can be determined.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, free from subjective or ambiguous language.\n\nThe problem is therefore deemed **valid**. It is a standard exercise in applying physical principles to a biological system, requiring meticulous attention to unit consistency.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows.\n\nThe fundamental principle is Fick's first law of diffusion, which relates the molar flux $J$ to the concentration gradient $\\frac{dC}{dx}$. For one-dimensional, steady-state diffusion, the law is written as:\n$$J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}$$\nwhere $J$ is the molar flux, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $\\frac{dC}{dx}$ is the concentration gradient. The negative sign indicates that diffusion occurs in the direction of decreasing concentration.\n\nFor a finite diffusion path length $\\Delta x$ and a constant concentration gradient, the derivative can be approximated by the finite difference:\n$$\\frac{dC}{dx} \\approx \\frac{C_{final} - C_{initial}}{\\Delta x}$$\nIn this problem, diffusion occurs from the seawater (higher concentration) to the hemolymph (lower concentration). We are given the concentration difference $\\Delta C = C_{seawater} - C_{hemolymph} = 0.2$ $\\mathrm{mM}$. Thus, the gradient is $\\frac{C_{hemolymph} - C_{seawater}}{\\Delta x} = -\\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta x}$.\n\nSubstituting this into Fick's law:\n$$J = -D \\left( -\\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta x} \\right) = \\frac{D \\Delta C}{\\Delta x}$$\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of the flux, which is given by this expression. Before calculation, all parameters must be converted to a consistent system of units, specifically one using centimeters, moles, and seconds, to match the target units for the flux.\n\n1.  **Diffusion Coefficient ($D$):**\n    The value is given as $D = 2 \\times 10^{-5}$ $\\mathrm{cm^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$. This is already in the required unit system.\n\n2.  **Diffusion Path Length ($\\Delta x$):**\n    The thickness is given as $\\Delta x = 10$ $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. We convert micrometers to centimeters.\n    Since $1$ $\\mathrm{cm} = 10^{4}$ $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, we have:\n    $$\\Delta x = 10 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\mathrm{cm}}{10^{4} \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 10 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{cm} = 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{cm}$$\n\n3.  **Concentration Difference ($\\Delta C$):**\n    The concentration difference is given as $\\Delta C = 0.2$ $\\mathrm{mM}$. We must convert this to $\\mathrm{mol\\,cm^{-3}}$.\n    First, convert millimolar ($mM$) to molar ($M$ or $\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$):\n    $$\\Delta C = 0.2 \\, \\mathrm{mM} = 0.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{M} = 2 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$$\n    Next, convert liters ($L$) to cubic centimeters ($\\mathrm{cm^3}$). Since $1$ $\\mathrm{L} = 1000$ $\\mathrm{cm^3}$:\n    $$\\Delta C = 2 \\times 10^{-4} \\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\mathrm{L}}{1000 \\, \\mathrm{cm^3}} = 2 \\times 10^{-4} \\times 10^{-3} \\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{cm^3}} = 2 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\mathrm{mol\\,cm^{-3}}$$\n\nNow all parameters are in consistent units. We substitute them into the flux equation:\n$$J = \\frac{D \\Delta C}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{(2 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{cm^{2}\\,s^{-1}}) (2 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\mathrm{mol\\,cm^{-3}})}{10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{cm}}$$\nPerforming the arithmetic:\n$$J = \\frac{4 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\mathrm{mol \\cdot cm^{-1} \\cdot s^{-1}}}{10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{cm}}$$\n$$J = 4 \\times 10^{-12 - (-3)} \\, \\mathrm{mol \\cdot cm^{-2} \\cdot s^{-1}}$$\n$$J = 4 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{mol\\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$$\nThe result is $4 \\times 10^{-9}$ $\\mathrm{mol\\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the ratio of the volumetric flow rate after a change in radius to the flow rate before the change.

The term $A \\exp\\left(\\frac{z}{\\lambda_{char}}\\right)$ grows without bound as $z \\to \\infty$ (since $\\lambda_{char}$ is real and positive).
