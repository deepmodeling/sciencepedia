We proceed with the solution.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Volumetric Flow Rate $Q$**\nWe begin with the Navier-Stokes equation for an incompressible fluid in cylindrical coordinates $(r', \\theta, z)$. For a steady $(\\partial/\\partial t = 0)$, axisymmetric $(\\partial/\\partial \\theta = 0, v_\\theta=0)$, and fully developed $(\\partial v_z/\\partial z = 0)$ flow, the velocity vector is $\\mathbf{v} = v_z(r')\\mathbf{\\hat{z}}$.

The inertial terms are identically zero: $\\rho(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla)v_z = 0$. Assuming gravitational effects are negligible or absorbed into the pressure term, the balance is between the pressure gradient and viscous forces.\n\nThe $z$-component of the steady-state Navier-Stokes equation becomes:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z} + \\eta \\left[ \\frac{1}{r'}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r'}\\left(r' \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial r'}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r'^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial \\theta^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial z^2} \\right] $$\nWith axisymmetry and fully developed flow, the equation further reduces to an ordinary differential equation, as $v_z$ is a function of $r'$ only:\n$$ \\frac{d P}{d z} = \\eta \\frac{1}{r'}\\frac{d}{d r'}\\left(r' \\frac{d v_z}{d r'}\\right) $$\nHere, $\\frac{d P}{d z}$ is a constant as given. We can now integrate this equation twice to find the velocity profile $v_z(r')$.\nRearranging and integrating with respect to $r'$:\n$$ r' \\frac{d}{d r'}\\left(r' \\frac{d v_z}{d r'}\\right) = \\frac{r'}{\\eta} \\frac{d P}{d z} $$\n$$ \\int d\\left(r' \\frac{d v_z}{d r'}\\right) = \\int \\frac{r'}{\\eta} \\frac{d P}{d z} dr' $$\n$$ r' \\frac{d v_z}{d r'} = \\frac{r'^2}{2\\eta} \\frac{d P}{d z} + C_1 $$\nTo determine the constant of integration $C_1$, we apply the boundary condition of finite velocity at the centerline ($r'=0$). Dividing by $r'$ gives $\\frac{d v_z}{d r'} = \\frac{r'}{2\\eta} \\frac{d P}{d z} + \\frac{C_1}{r'}$. The term $\\frac{C_1}{r'}$ would cause the velocity gradient to be infinite at $r'=0$ unless $C_1 = 0$.

The assumptions are:\n$1$. At the source (e.g., a leaf), active transport loads solutes (primarily sucrose) into sieve tube elements.\n$2$. This increase in solute concentration lowers the solute potential, and thus the total water potential, within the sieve tube.\n$3$. Water from adjacent xylem tissue, having a higher water potential, moves into the source-end sieve tube via osmosis.\n$4$. This influx of water generates a high hydrostatic pressure (turgor pressure) at the source.\n$5$. Conversely, at the sink (e.g., a root or fruit), solutes are unloaded from the sieve tube, either actively or passively.\n$6$. This removal of solutes raises the water potential inside the sink-end sieve tube, causing water to flow out via osmosis.\n$7$. This efflux of water results in a low hydrostatic pressure at the sink.\nThe difference between the high pressure at the source and the low pressure at the sink creates the pressure gradient along the length of the sieve tube, driving the bulk flow of sap.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Calculation**\nFlow occurs from high pressure to low pressure. Thus, for flow in the positive $z$-direction, the pressure gradient $\\frac{d P}{d z}$ must be negative. The problem provides the magnitude of the gradient, which we define as $\\frac{\\Delta P}{L} = -\\frac{d P}{d z}$.

We do this by finding the critical points of the function, which occur where its derivative with respect to $c_s$ is zero.\n$$\\frac{dJ}{dc_s} = 0$$\nSince $C$ is a positive constant, we need only differentiate the concentration-dependent part of the expression. Using the product rule for differentiation on $f(c_s) = (c_s^2 - c_k c_s) \\exp(-\\beta c_s)$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dc_s} \\left[ (c_s^2 - c_k c_s) \\exp(-\\beta c_s) \\right] = \\frac{d}{dc_s}(c_s^2 - c_k c_s) \\cdot \\exp(-\\beta c_s) + (c_s^2 - c_k c_s) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dc_s}(\\exp(-\\beta c_s))$$\n$$\\frac{df}{dc_s} = (2c_s - c_k) \\exp(-\\beta c_s) + (c_s^2 - c_k c_s) (-\\beta \\exp(-\\beta c_s))$$\nWe set this derivative to zero:\n$$(2c_s - c_k) \\exp(-\\beta c_s) - \\beta (c_s^2 - c_k c_s) \\exp(-\\beta c_s) = 0$$\nThe term $\\exp(-\\beta c_s)$ is always positive, so we can divide it out, leaving a polynomial equation:\n$$2c_s - c_k - \\beta(c_s^2 - c_k c_s) = 0$$\n$$2c_s - c_k - \\beta c_s^2 + \\beta c_k c_s = 0$$\nRearranging this into a standard quadratic form $a x^2 + b x + c = 0$ for the variable $c_s$:\n$$\\beta c_s^2 - (2 + \\beta c_k) c_s + c_k = 0$$\nWe solve this quadratic equation for $c_s$ using the quadratic formula, $c_s = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = \\beta$, $b = -(2 + \\beta c_k)$, and $c = c_k$.\n$$c_s = \\frac{(2 + \\beta c_k) \\pm \\sqrt{(-(2 + \\beta c_k))^2 - 4(\\beta)(c_k)}}{2\\beta}$$\n$$c_s = \\frac{2 + \\beta c_k \\pm \\sqrt{(2 + \\beta c_k)^2 - 4\\beta c_k}}{2\\beta}$$\nSimplifying the term under the square root:\n$$(2 + \\beta c_k)^2 - 4\\beta c_k = (4 + 4\\beta c_k + (\\beta c_k)^2) - 4\\beta c_k = 4 + (\\beta c_k)^2$$\nThus, the two solutions for the critical points are:\n$$c_s = \\frac{2 + \\beta c_k \\pm \\sqrt{4 + (\\beta c_k)^2}}{2\\beta}$$\nThe physical domain of the problem is $c_s \\geq c_k$, as a smaller source concentration would reverse the flow. At the boundary $c_s = c_k$, the flux $J(c_k) = 0$. For very large $c_s$, the exponential term $\\exp(-\\beta c_s)$ dominates and $J(c_s) \\to 0$. Since $J(c_s)$ is positive for $c_s  c_k$, there must be a single maximum within this domain. We analyze the two roots. The root with the minus sign, $c_s = \\frac{2 + \\beta c_k - \\sqrt{4 + (\\beta c_k)^2}}{2\\beta}$, is less than $c_k$ and thus outside the physical domain of interest. The maximum must therefore correspond to the root with the plus sign.\nThe optimal source concentration, $c_{s,opt}$, is given by:\n$$c_{s,opt} = \\frac{2 + \\beta c_k + \\sqrt{4 + (\\beta c_k)^2}}{2\\beta}$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided parameter values:\n- $\\beta = 4.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m^{3}\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $c_k = 50\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}$\n\nFirst, calculate the dimensionless product $\\beta c_k$:\n$$\\beta c_k = (4.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m^{3}\\,mol^{-1}}) \\times (50\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}) = 0.2$$\nSubstitute this value into the expression for $c_{s,opt}$:\n$$c_{s,opt} = \\frac{2 + 0.2 + \\sqrt{4 + (0.2)^2}}{2 \\times (4.0 \\times 10^{-3})}$$\n$$c_{s,opt} = \\frac{2.2 + \\sqrt{4 + 0.04}}{8.0 \\times 10^{-3}}$$\n$$c_{s,opt} = \\frac{2.2 + \\sqrt{4.04}}{8.0 \\times 10^{-3}}$$\nCalculating the numerator:\n$$\\sqrt{4.04} \\approx 2.00997512$$\n$$2.2 + 2.00997512 = 4.20997512$$\nFinally, performing the division:\n$$c_{s,opt} = \\frac{4.20997512}{8.0 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx 526.24689\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$c_{s,opt} \\approx 526.2\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}$$\nThe other given parameters ($r$, $L$, $R$, $T$, $\\eta_w$) affect the magnitude of the flux $J(c_s)$, but not the location of its maximum, $c_{s,opt}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{526.2}$$", "id": "2596174"}]}
