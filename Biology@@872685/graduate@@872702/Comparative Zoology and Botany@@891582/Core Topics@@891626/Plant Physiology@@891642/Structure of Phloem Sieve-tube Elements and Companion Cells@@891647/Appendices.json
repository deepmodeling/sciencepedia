It is a well-posed, constrained optimization problem with all necessary information provided and no internal contradictions. The language is objective and the parameters are physically realistic for the biological system in question. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution may be pursued.\n\nThe objective is to maximize the total conductance $G_{\\text{tot}}(r, n)$. First, we must express this quantity as a function of a single variable, either $r$ or $n$. The constraint $n \\pi r^{2} = f A$ allows us to write $n$ in terms of $r$:\n$$\nn = \\frac{fA}{\\pi r^{2}}\n$$\nThe per-pore resistance is the sum of the tube and orifice resistances:\n$$\nR_{p}(r) = R_{\\text{HP}} + R_{\\text{S}} = \\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi r^{4}} + \\frac{3 \\mu}{r^{3}}\n$$\nTo facilitate combination, we find a common denominator:\n$$\nR_{p}(r) = \\frac{8 \\mu L + 3 \\mu \\pi r}{\\pi r^{4}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $n$ and $R_{p}(r)$ into the formula for the total conductance $G_{\\text{tot}}$:\n$$\nG_{\\text{tot}}(r) = \\frac{n}{R_{p}(r)} = \\left(\\frac{fA}{\\pi r^{2}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\pi r^{4}}{8 \\mu L + 3 \\mu \\pi r}\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields:\n$$\nG_{\\text{tot}}(r) = \\frac{f A r^{2}}{8 \\mu L + 3 \\mu \\pi r} = \\frac{fA}{\\mu} \\left(\\frac{r^{2}}{8L + 3\\pi r}\\right)\n$$\nTo find the radius $r$ that maximizes $G_{\\text{tot}}$, we must analyze the behavior of this function with respect to $r$. We can examine its derivative. Let $C = \\frac{fA}{\\mu}$ be a positive constant. We need to maximize the function $g(r) = \\frac{r^{2}}{8L + 3\\pi r}$. Using the quotient rule for differentiation with respect to $r$:\n$$\n\\frac{dg}{dr} = \\frac{(2r)(8L + 3\\pi r) - (r^2)(3\\pi)}{(8L + 3\\pi r)^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dg}{dr} = \\frac{16Lr + 6\\pi r^2 - 3\\pi r^2}{(8L + 3\\pi r)^{2}} = \\frac{16Lr + 3\\pi r^2}{(8L + 3\\pi r)^{2}}\n$$\nSince pore radius $r$ and plate thickness $L$ must be positive physical quantities, the terms in the derivative have the following properties for $r > 0$:\n- Numerator: $16Lr + 3\\pi r^2 = r(16L + 3\\pi r) > 0$\n- Denominator: $(8L + 3\\pi r)^{2} > 0$\nTherefore, $\\frac{dg}{dr} > 0$ for all physically meaningful values of $r$. This proves that $G_{\\text{tot}}(r)$ is a monotonically increasing function of the pore radius $r$.\n\nGiven that the objective function $G_{\\text{tot}}(r)$ is monotonically increasing, its maximum value will occur at the largest possible value of $r$ that is permitted by the problem's constraints. We must formalize these constraints in terms of $r$.\n1. Defense constraint: $r \\le r_{\\max}$\n2. Redundancy constraint: $n \\ge n_{\\min}$. We use the area constraint $n = \\frac{fA}{\\pi r^{2}}$ to translate this into a constraint on $r$:\n$$\n\\frac{fA}{\\pi r^{2}} \\ge n_{\\min} \\implies r^{2} \\le \\frac{fA}{n_{\\min}\\pi} \\implies r \\le \\sqrt{\\frac{fA}{n_{\\min}\\pi}}\n$$\nLet us define $r_{n} = \\sqrt{\\frac{fA}{n_{\\min}\\pi}}$. The optimal radius $r^{\\star}$ must satisfy both upper bounds simultaneously. To maximize $r$, we must therefore choose the most restrictive (i.e., the smallest) of these upper bounds. The analytical expression for the optimal radius is thus:\n$$\nr^{\\star} = \\min\\left(r_{\\max}, \\sqrt{\\frac{fA}{n_{\\min}\\pi}}\\right)\n$$\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided parameters. All values must be in base SI units (meters, etc.).\n$A = 2.01 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{m}^{2}$\n$f = 0.06$\n$n_{\\min} = 20$\n$r_{\\max} = 0.50 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the constraint boundary from the redundancy requirement:\n$$\nr_{n} = \\sqrt{\\frac{fA}{n_{\\min}\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(0.06)(2.01 \\times 10^{-10})}{(20)\\pi}} \\ \\text{m}\n$$\n$$\nr_{n} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.206 \\times 10^{-11}}{20\\pi}} \\ \\text{m} \\approx \\sqrt{1.919 \\times 10^{-13}} \\ \\text{m}\n$$\n$$\nr_{n} \\approx 4.3808 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\text{m}\n$$\nNow, we compare this value with $r_{\\max}$:\n$r_{n} \\approx 4.3808 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\text{m}$\n$r_{\\max} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\text{m}$\n\nSince $r_{n} < r_{\\max}$, the redundancy constraint is the limiting factor. The optimal radius is $r^{\\star} = r_{n}$.\n$r^{\\star} \\approx 4.3808 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\text{m}$\nThe problem requires the answer in micrometers, rounded to three significant figures.\n$1 \\ \\mu\\text{m} = 10^{-6} \\ \\text{m}$, so $r^{\\star} \\approx 0.43808 \\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\nRounding to three significant figures gives $r^{\\star} = 0.438 \\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nFinally, the biological trade-offs implied by this solution are considered. The analysis shows that for a fixed open area fraction $f$, hydraulic conductance is maximized by making pores as large as possible. This is because resistance decreases with radius faster than the required number of pores does ($R_p$ scales between $r^{-3}$ and $r^{-4}$, while $n$ scales as $r^{-2}$). This leads to a preference for fewer, larger pores. This drive towards larger pores is checked by two constraints.\n1.  **Efficiency vs. Defense**: The $r \\le r_{\\max}$ constraint represents a defense mechanism. Phloem sap is under high pressure and rich in sugars. An injury could lead to catastrophic loss of resources. Pores must be small enough to be rapidly sealed by P-proteins and callose deposition. Pores larger than $r_{\\max}$ would be too difficult to plug.\n2.  **Efficiency vs. Redundancy**: The $n \\ge n_{\\min}$ constraint ensures robustness against blockage. Even without injury, pores can become occluded. If the system consisted of only a few highly efficient large pores, the blockage of one would severely cripple transport. A minimum number of pores provides redundancy, ensuring that the system can tolerate some failures.\nIn this specific case, the optimal design is limited by redundancy, not by the maximum defensible pore size. The system sacrifices some potential hydraulic efficiency to maintain a sufficient number of parallel transport channels. The entire system, consisting of the sieve-tube element and its associated companion cell, is governed by these physical compromises. The metabolic energy supplied by the companion cell to drive transport (i.e., maintain $\\Delta P$) is utilized most effectively when hydraulic resistance is low, but the long-term survival of the organism requires that the transport system be both defensible and robust, justifying the constraints that prevent the attainment of the theoretical maximum hydraulic efficiency.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.438}$$", "id": "2612900"}]}
