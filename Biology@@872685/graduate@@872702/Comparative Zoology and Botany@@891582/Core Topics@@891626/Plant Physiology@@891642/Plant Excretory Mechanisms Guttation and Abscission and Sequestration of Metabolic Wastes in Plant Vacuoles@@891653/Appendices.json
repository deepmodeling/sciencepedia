The calculation is made numerically stable by using a `log1p` function, which is designed to accurately compute $\\ln(1+x)$ for small $x$. Therefore, we calculate $\\ln(1-S)$ as `log1p(-S)`.\n- Compute $k_i = (R_i/S) k_{\\text{tot}}$ for $i \\in \\{v,g,m,a\\}$.\n- Round each rate to six decimal places and return the list $[k_v, k_g, k_m, k_a, k_{\\text{tot}}]$ for each test case.\n\nMass-balance verification (implicit): With the computed $k_{\\text{tot}}$ and $k_i$, the model-predicted recovered fractions are $\\widehat{R}_i = (k_i/k_{\\text{tot}})(1 - \\exp(-k_{\\text{tot}} T)) = (R_i/S) S = R_i$, so the calibration is exact under the stated model.\n\nComputational complexity is constant per case, dominated by a few floating-point operations. Numerical stability is maintained for $S$ near $0$ by evaluating $\\ln(1 - S)$ carefully; rounding to six decimal places ensures standardized output.\n\nApplying the algorithm to the four specified cases yields deterministic outputs in $\\text{day}^{-1}$, printed as a single line containing a list of lists in the order $[k_v, k_g, k_m, k_a, k_{\\text{tot}}]$ for each case.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calibrate_rates(T, Rv, Rg, Rm, Ra):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calibrate first-order rates (per day) for vacuolar sequestration, guttation,\n    metabolic conversion, and abscission from tracer recoveries over a season of length T days.\n\n    Returns (kv, kg, km, ka, ktot).\n    \"\"\"\n    S = Rv + Rg + Rm + Ra\n    if not (T > 0.0):\n        raise ValueError(\"Season length T must be positive.\")\n    if not (0.0  S  1.0):\n        raise ValueError(\"Sum of recoveries must be in (0,1).\")\n    # Numerically stable computation of ktot\n    ktot = -np.log1p(-S) / T  # -ln(1 - S) / T\n    # Partition rates proportional to recoveries\n    kv = (Rv / S) * ktot\n    kg = (Rg / S) * ktot\n    km = (Rm / S) * ktot\n    ka = (Ra / S) * ktot\n    return kv, kg, km, ka, ktot\n\ndef format_case(result):\n    # Format each float to 6 decimal places\n    return \"[\" + \",\".join(f\"{x:.6f}\" for x in result) + \"]\"\n\ndef solve():\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each tuple: (T, Rv, Rg, Rm, Ra)\n    test_cases = [\n        (90.0, 0.25, 0.15, 0.10, 0.20),   # Case 1\n        (7.0, 0.02, 0.005, 0.003, 0.002), # Case 2\n        (180.0, 0.80, 0.05, 0.04, 0.06),  # Case 3\n        (120.0, 0.30, 0.20, 0.20, 0.29),  # Case 4\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        T, Rv, Rg, Rm, Ra = case\n        kv, kg, km, ka, ktot = calibrate_rates(T, Rv, Rg, Rm, Ra)\n        results.append([kv, kg, km, ka, ktot])\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(\"[\" + \",\".join(format_case(res) for res in results) + \"]\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```", "id": "2600290"}]}
