Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe total water potential, $\\Psi_{w}$, of a plant cell is the sum of its component potentials. Given that gravitational potential ($\\Psi_{g}$) and matric potential ($\\Psi_{m}$) are to be neglected, the equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\Psi_{w} = \\Psi_{s} + \\Psi_{p} $$\nwhere $\\Psi_{s}$ is the solute (or osmotic) potential and $\\Psi_{p}$ is the pressure potential (or turgor pressure).\n\nThe first task is to compute the solute potential, $\\Psi_{s}$. The solute potential is a function of the solute concentration and is related to the osmotic pressure, $\\Pi$, of the solution. The relationship is given by:\n$$ \\Psi_{s} = -\\Pi $$\nThe negative sign indicates that the presence of solutes lowers the water potential.\n\nThe osmotic pressure, $\\Pi$, for a dilute ideal solution is described by the van 't Hoff equation:\n$$ \\Pi = i C_{s} R T $$\nwhere $i$ is the van 't Hoff factor, $C_{s}$ is the molar concentration of the solute, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of physical chemistry and plant physiology, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. We shall proceed.\n\nThe solution is partitioned into three components as requested: derivation of the osmotic potential expression, numerical evaluation for the given conditions, and a qualitative discussion of non-ideal effects.\n\nFirst, we derive the dilute-solution expression for the osmotic (solute) potential, $\\Psi_s$. Water potential, $\\Psi_w$, is defined as the chemical potential of water, $\\mu_w$, relative to the chemical potential of pure water at reference pressure, $\\mu_w^o$, normalized by the partial molar volume of water, $\\bar{V}_w$.\n$$ \\Psi_w = \\frac{\\mu_w - \\mu_w^o}{\\bar{V}_w} $$\nConsider a system at thermodynamic equilibrium, where a solution is separated from pure water by a membrane permeable only to water. The pure water is at reference pressure $P_o$, and the solution is at pressure $P$, which is elevated by the osmotic pressure, $\\Pi$, such that $P = P_o + \\Pi$. At equilibrium, the chemical potential of water is uniform throughout the system:\n$$ \\mu_w(\\text{pure water at } P_o) = \\mu_w(\\text{solution at } P) $$\nBy definition, $\\mu_w(\\text{pure water at } P_o) = \\mu_w^o$. The chemical potential of water in the solution is given by:\n$$ \\mu_w(\\text{solution at } P) = \\mu_w^*(P) + RT \\ln(x_w) $$\nHere, $\\mu_w^*(P)$ is the chemical potential of pure water at pressure $P$, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $x_w$ is the mole fraction of water in the solution.\n\nThe pressure dependence of chemical potential is given by $(\\partial \\mu_w^*/\\partial P)_T = \\bar{V}_w$. Assuming water is an incompressible fluid, $\\bar{V}_w$ is constant. Integrating from $P_o$ to $P$ yields:\n$$ \\mu_w^*(P) - \\mu_w^*(P_o) = \\bar{V}_w(P - P_o) = \\bar{V}_w \\Pi $$\nSince $\\mu_w^*(P_o)$ is simply $\\mu_w^o$, we have $\\mu_w^*(P) = \\mu_w^o + \\bar{V}_w \\Pi$. Substituting this into the equilibrium condition:\n$$ \\mu_w^o = (\\mu_w^o + \\bar{V}_w \\Pi) + RT \\ln(x_w) $$\n$$ -\\bar{V}_w \\Pi = RT \\ln(x_w) $$\nThis expression relates osmotic pressure to the mole fraction of water. The osmotic potential, $\\Psi_s$, is the solute-dependent component of the total water potential. For a solution at the reference pressure $P_o$, the pressure potential $\\Psi_p = P - P_o = 0$, and thus $\\Psi_w = \\Psi_s$. The water potential is:\n$$ \\Psi_s = \\frac{\\mu_w(\\text{solution at } P_o) - \\mu_w^o}{\\bar{V}_w} = \\frac{(\\mu_w^o + RT \\ln(x_w)) - \\mu_w^o}{\\bar{V}_w} = \\frac{RT}{\\bar{V}_w} \\ln(x_w) $$\nNote that $\\Psi_s = -\\Pi$. The solute potential is inherently negative as $x_w  1$ and thus $\\ln(x_w)  0$.\n\nFor a dilute solution, we introduce approximations. The mole fraction of water is $x_w = 1 - x_{\\text{solutes}}$, where $x_{\\text{solutes}}$ is the total mole fraction of all solute particles. For a dilute solution, $x_{\\text{solutes}} \\ll 1$, and we can use the Taylor series expansion $\\ln(1 - z) \\approx -z$ for small $z$.\n$$ \\ln(x_w) = \\ln(1 - x_{\\text{solutes}}) \\approx -x_{\\text{solutes}} $$\nThe solute mole fraction is $x_{\\text{solutes}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{solutes}}}{n_w + n_{\\text{solutes}}} \\approx \\frac{n_{\\text{solutes}}}{n_w}$, where $n_{\\text{solutes}}$ and $n_w$ are the moles of solute particles and water, respectively.\nSubstituting these approximations gives:\n$$ \\Psi_s \\approx \\frac{RT}{\\bar{V}_w} \\left(-\\frac{n_{\\text{solutes}}}{n_w}\\right) = -RT \\left(\\frac{n_{\\text{solutes}}}{n_w \\bar{V}_w}\\right) $$\nThe term $n_w \\bar{V}_w$ is the total volume of the solvent, water. For a dilute aqueous solution, this volume is approximately equal to the total volume of the solution, $V$. The term $n_{\\text{solutes}}/V$ is the total molar concentration of all solute particles, $C_{\\text{solutes}}$.\n$$ \\Psi_s \\approx -RT C_{\\text{solutes}} $$\nFor an electrolyte with a stoichiometric concentration $c$, the concentration of solute particles is given by $C_{\\text{solutes}} = i \\cdot c$, where $i$ is the van 't Hoff factor, representing the number of independent particles formed per formula unit of the solute in solution. For a $1{:}1$ electrolyte such as potassium chloride ($\\text{KCl}$), ideal dissociation ($\\text{KCl} \\rightarrow \\text{K}^+ + \\text{Cl}^-$) yields two particles, so $i = 2$. Therefore, the desired expression is:\n$$ \\Psi_s = -i c R T $$\nThis is the van 't Hoff equation for osmotic potential.\n\nSecond, we evaluate $\\Psi_s$ for the given conditions.\nThe parameters are:\n-   Stoichiometric concentration, $c = 0.35$ mol L$^{-1}$\n-   van 't Hoff factor, $i = 2$\n-   Universal gas constant, $R = 0.008314$ MPa L mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$\n-   Absolute temperature, $T = 298.15$ K\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$ \\Psi_s = -(2) \\cdot (0.35 \\text{ mol L}^{-1}) \\cdot (0.008314 \\text{ MPa L mol}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}) \\cdot (298.15 \\text{ K}) $$\nThe calculation is executed as follows:\n$$ \\Psi_s = -(0.7) \\cdot (0.008314) \\cdot (298.15) \\text{ MPa} $$\n$$ \\Psi_s = -1.73516... \\text{ MPa} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we obtain:\n$$ \\Psi_s = -1.735 \\text{ MPa} $$\n\nThird, we discuss qualitatively the effect of short-range ion association. The ideal-dissociation model, which assumes $i=2$ for $\\text{KCl}$, neglects electrostatic interactions between ions. In a real solution, particularly at a non-negligible concentration of $0.35$ mol L$^{-1}$, oppositely charged ions ($\\text{K}^+$ and $\\text{Cl}^-$) attract one another and can form transient, non-covalent aggregates known as \"ion pairs\". An ion pair, such as $[\\text{K}^+\\text{Cl}^-]^0$, behaves osmotically as a single particle rather than two distinct ions.\n\nThis phenomenon reduces the total number of independent, osmotically active particles in the solution compared to the stoichiometric expectation. To account for this non-ideality within the dilute-solution framework, the ideal van 't Hoff factor $i$ is replaced by an effective, non-ideal parameter. This is most rigorously done using the osmotic coefficient, $\\phi$. The osmotic potential expression becomes:\n$$ \\Psi_s = -\\nu \\phi c R T $$\nwhere $\\nu$ is the number of ions per formula unit from stoichiometry (for $\\text{KCl}$, $\\nu=2$) and $\\phi$ is the osmotic coefficient, which is less than $1$ for a non-ideal solution with attractive inter-ionic forces. Alternatively, one can use an effective van 't Hoff factor, $i_{\\text{eff}} = \\nu \\phi$. Since $\\phi  1$, it follows that $i_{\\text{eff}}  \\nu = 2$.\n\nThe consequence of ion pairing is that the actual magnitude of the osmotic potential, $|\\Psi_s|$, is less than the ideal calculated value. The solute potential becomes less negative (i.e., higher) than the $-1.735$ MPa computed under the ideal assumption.\n$$ |\\Psi_s|_{\\text{real}} = |-\\nu \\phi c R T|  |-\\nu c R T| = |\\Psi_s|_{\\text{ideal}} $$\nWater moves down a water potential gradient. The driving force for water to enter the cell symplast from the apoplast is $\\Delta\\Psi_w = \\Psi_{w, \\text{symplast}} - \\Psi_{w, \\text{apoplast}}$. The apoplastic water potential is dominated by the solute potential, $\\Psi_{w, \\text{apoplast}} \\approx \\Psi_s$. Because ion pairing makes $\\Psi_s$ less negative (a higher value), it raises the water potential of the apoplastic solution. This reduces the magnitude of the water potential gradient across the plasma membrane, $|\\Delta\\Psi_w|$. Consequently, ion pairing diminishes the thermodynamic driving force for water transport from the apoplast into the symplast. A lesser driving force for symplastic uptake implies that a greater proportion of water flow through the root tissue would proceed via the apoplastic pathway, bypassing the cell membranes.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-1.735} $$", "id": "2621711"}, {"introduction": "We now transition from the thermodynamic state of a single cell to the dynamics of water transport across an entire tissue.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and definitions to derive a unique solution without ambiguity or contradiction. It is a formalizable problem that requires a logical derivation based on the provided model.\n\nWe begin by formalizing the relationship between volumetric water flux, $J_{v}$, and water potential, $\\Psi_{w}$. The problem states that for a single anatomical layer, the flux is proportional to the drop in water potential across that layer. For a layer indexed by $i$, this is expressed as:\n$$J_{v} = K_{i} \\Delta \\Psi_{w,i}$$\nwhere $K_{i}$ is the hydraulic conductance of the layer and $\\Delta \\Psi_{w,i}$ is the water potential difference across it. Hydraulic resistance, $R_i$, is defined as the reciprocal of conductance:\n$$R_{i} = \\frac{1}{K_{i}}$$\nSubstituting this definition into the flux equation gives:\n$$J_{v} = \\frac{1}{R_{i}} \\Delta \\Psi_{w,i}$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to express the potential drop as a function of flux and resistance, which is analogous to Ohm's Law in electrical circuits:\n$$\\Delta \\Psi_{w,i} = J_{v} R_{i}$$\nThe problem models the radial water transport across the root as a series of layers: epidermis ($e$), cortex ($c$), endodermis ($\\mathrm{endo}$), and pericycle ($p$). At steady state, the principle of mass conservation dictates that the volumetric flux, $J_{v}$, must be constant through each layer in the series. If it were not, water would accumulate or be depleted within a layer, which contradicts the steady-state assumption.\n\nThe total drop in water potential across the entire root segment, $\\Delta \\Psi_{w,\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the potential drops across the individual layers connected in series:\n$$\\Delta \\Psi_{w,\\text{total}} = \\Delta \\Psi_{w,e} + \\Delta \\Psi_{w,c} + \\Delta \\Psi_{w,\\mathrm{endo}} + \\Delta \\Psi_{w,p}$$\nSubstituting the expression $\\Delta \\Psi_{w,i} = J_{v} R_{i}$ for each layer into this sum, we obtain:\n$$\\Delta \\Psi_{w,\\text{total}} = J_{v} R_{e} + J_{v} R_{c} + J_{v} R_{\\mathrm{endo}} + J_{v} R_{p}$$\nSince the flux $J_{v}$ is constant throughout the series, it can be factored out:\n$$\\Delta \\Psi_{w,\\text{total}} = J_{v} (R_{e} + R_{c} + R_{\\mathrm{endo}} + R_{p})$$\nNow, we consider the entire root segment as a single composite layer with a total resistance $R_{\\text{total}}$. The relationship for this composite layer is:\n$$\\Delta \\Psi_{w,\\text{total}} = J_{v} R_{\\text{total}}$$\nBy comparing the two preceding expressions for $\\Delta \\Psi_{w,\\text{total}}$, we can equate them:\n$$J_{v} R_{\\text{total}} = J_{v} (R_{e} + R_{c} + R_{\\mathrm{endo}} + R_{p})$$\nAssuming a non-zero water flow ($J_{v} \\neq 0$), we can divide both sides by $J_{v}$, which yields the rule for a series-resistance model:\n$$R_{\\text{total}} = R_{e} + R_{c} + R_{\\mathrm{endo}} + R_{p}$$\nThis justifies the statement that the total resistance across multiple layers in series is the sum of the individual layer resistances.\n\nNext, we are tasked with computing the fraction of the total resistance contributed by the endodermis.
