It is a fundamental derivation, not a trivial exercise.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a straightforward and fundamental problem in biophysical transport phenomena. A solution will now be derived from first principles as requested.\n\nThe derivation proceeds as follows. The system consists of two diffusive domains in series: the boundary layer and the stomatal pores. The core principle for a steady-state system is the conservation of mass flux, which dictates that the flux of carbon dioxide, $J_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}}$, must be constant through each domain.\n\nWe are given the general relation for flux across a domain with conductance $g$ as $J = g \\,(C_{\\mathrm{upstream}} - C_{\\mathrm{downstream}})$. The problem defines $J_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}}$ to be positive for movement from the atmosphere towards the intercellular airspace. This sign convention must be applied consistently.\n\nFirst, consider the boundary layer. The upstream concentration is the ambient concentration, $C_a$, and the downstream concentration is at the leaf surface, $C_s$. The conductance is $g_{bl}$. Therefore, the flux across the boundary layer is:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}} = g_{bl} (C_a - C_s)$$\nThis equation is consistent with our sign convention: if $C_a > C_s$, the flux $J_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}}$ is positive, corresponding to influx.\n\nNext, consider the stomatal pores. The flux $J_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}}$ now passes from the leaf surface into the intercellular airspace. Here, the upstream concentration is $C_s$ and the downstream concentration is $C_i$. The conductance is $g_{st}$. The flux across the stomatal domain is:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}} = g_{st} (C_s - C_i)$$\nAgain, this is consistent: if $C_s > C_i$, the flux is positive.\n\nAt steady state, the flux must be conserved across the series domains. Therefore, we have a system of two equations for the single unknown flux $J_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}}$:\n$$(1) \\quad J_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}} = g_{bl} (C_a - C_s)$$\n$$(2) \\quad J_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}} = g_{st} (C_s - C_i)$$\n\nThe objective is to eliminate the intermediate, and typically unmeasurable, surface concentration $C_s$. We can rearrange both equations to express the concentration drops in terms of the flux:\nFrom equation $(1)$:\n$$C_a - C_s = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}}}{g_{bl}}$$\nFrom equation $(2)$:\n$$C_s - C_i = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}}}{g_{st}}$$\n\nNow, we can add these two equations. The term $C_s$ will cancel out:\n$$(C_a - C_s) + (C_s - C_i) = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}}}{g_{bl}} + \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}}}{g_{st}}$$\nSimplifying the left side gives the total concentration drop across the entire system:\n$$C_a - C_i = J_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}} \\left( \\frac{1}{g_{bl}} + \\frac{1}{g_{st}} \\right)$$\n\nThis expression reveals the additive nature of the resistances ($1/g$) in series. To find the final expression for $J_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}}$, we solve for it. First, combine the terms in the parenthesis using a common denominator:\n$$C_a - C_i = J_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}} \\left( \\frac{g_{st} + g_{bl}}{g_{bl} g_{st}} \\right)$$\n\nFinally, isolating $J_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}}$ by multiplying both sides by the inverse of the term in parentheses yields the desired closed-form expression:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}} = \\frac{g_{bl} g_{st}}{g_{bl} + g_{st}} (C_a - C_i)$$\nThis result is analogous to Ohm's law ($I = V/R$) where $J_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}}$ is the current (flux), $(C_a - C_i)$ is the potential difference (concentration gradient), and the term $\\frac{g_{bl} + g_{st}}{g_{bl} g_{st}}$ is the total resistance $R_{total} = R_{bl} + R_{st} = \\frac{1}{g_{bl}} + \\frac{1}{g_{st}}$. The pre-factor $\\frac{g_{bl} g_{st}}{g_{bl} + g_{st}}$ is therefore the total or effective conductance of the system, $g_{total}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{J_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}} = \\frac{g_{bl} g_{st}}{g_{bl} + g_{st}} (C_a - C_i)}\n$$", "id": "2611895"}, {"introduction": "A plant's actual assimilation rate is determined at the intersection of the physical supply of $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ and its biochemical demand.

It describes a standard, simplified model of carbon isotope discrimination in C$_3$ plants, known as the Farquhar model. The assumptions are clearly stated to define the scope of the model, and the provided parameters are realistic. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\n(a) We are asked to derive a linear expression for the net isotopic discrimination, $\\Delta$, as a function of the ratio of intercellular to atmospheric $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ partial pressure, $C_i/C_a$, and the discrimination factors for diffusion, $a$, and carboxylation, $b$.\n\nThe net assimilation rate, A, is described by two processes in series: diffusion of $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ from the atmosphere to the intercellular air spaces, and subsequent biochemical fixation by Rubisco.\n\nThe Fickian model for diffusion through stomata is given as:\n$$A = g_{sc}(C_a - C_i)$$\nwhere $g_{sc}$ is the stomatal conductance to $\\mathrm{CO}_2$.\n\nFor the purpose of isotopic analysis, we consider the fluxes of both $^{12}\\mathrm{CO}_2$ and $^{13}\\mathrm{CO}_2$. Let $A$, $C_a$, and $C_i$ represent the quantities for $^{12}\\mathrm{CO}_2$ (the abundant isotope), and let $^{13}A$, $R_a C_a$, and $R_i C_i$ represent the corresponding quantities for $^{13}\\mathrm{CO}_2$, where $R$ is the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}/^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ ratio. The discrimination factors are defined based on the kinetic isotope effect. For diffusion, the conductance for $^{13}\\mathrm{CO}_2$ is $g_{sc} / (1 + a/1000)$, where $a$ is the discrimination in parts per thousand. Let us use fractional notation for simplicity in the derivation, such that the discrimination factor for diffusion is $(1+a)$ and for carboxylation is $(1+b)$.\n\nThe flux of $^{13}\\mathrm{CO}_2$ from the atmosphere to the intercellular space is:\n$$ ^{13}A_{diffusion} = \\frac{g_{sc}}{1+a}(C_a R_a - C_i R_i) $$\nwhere $R_a$ and $R_i$ are the isotope ratios in the atmosphere and intercellular space, respectively.\n\nThe flux of $^{13}\\mathrm{CO}_2$ consumed by carboxylation is:\n$$ ^{13}A_{carboxylation} = \\frac{V_{max\\_eff} C_i R_i}{1+b} $$\nwhere $V_{max\\_eff}$ is an effective carboxylation rate constant. The corresponding flux for $^{12}\\mathrm{CO}_2$ is $A = V_{max\\_eff} C_i$.\nThus, $^{13}A_{carboxylation} = A \\frac{R_i}{1+b}$.\n\nAt steady state, the net flux of each isotope must be equal through all steps of the process. Let $R_p$ be the isotope ratio of the assimilated organic matter. Then $^{13}A = A R_p$.\nFrom the carboxylation step, we have:\n$$ A R_p = A \\frac{R_i}{1+b} \\implies R_p = \\frac{R_i}{1+b} $$\nNow we equate the diffusive and net assimilation fluxes for $^{13}\\mathrm{CO}_2$:\n$$ A R_p = \\frac{g_{sc}}{1+a}(C_a R_a - C_i R_i) $$\nSubstitute $R_i = R_p(1+b)$:\n$$ A R_p = \\frac{g_{sc}}{1+a}(C_a R_a - C_i R_p(1+b)) $$\nDivide the entire equation by $A=g_{sc}(C_a - C_i)$:\n$$ R_p = \\frac{C_a R_a - C_i R_p(1+b)}{(1+a)(C_a - C_i)} $$\n$$ R_p(1+a)(C_a - C_i) = C_a R_a - C_i R_p(1+b) $$\nWe rearrange to solve for the overall discrimination, which relates $R_p$ to $R_a$. Let the overall discrimination factor be $(1+\\Delta) = R_a/R_p$. So, $R_p = R_a / (1+\\Delta)$.\n$$ \\frac{R_a}{1+\\Delta}(1+a)(C_a - C_i) = C_a R_a - C_i \\frac{R_a}{1+\\Delta}(1+b) $$\nWe can cancel $R_a$ from all terms:\n$$ \\frac{1}{1+\\Delta}(1+a)(C_a - C_i) = C_a - \\frac{C_i}{1+\\Delta}(1+b) $$\nMultiply by $(1+\\Delta)$:\n$$ (1+a)(C_a - C_i) = C_a(1+\\Delta) - C_i(1+b) $$\n$$ C_a - C_i + a C_a - a C_i = C_a + C_a \\Delta - C_i - b C_i $$\nThe terms $C_a$ and $-C_i$ cancel on both sides:\n$$ a C_a - a C_i = C_a \\Delta - b C_i $$\nSolving for $C_a \\Delta$:\n$$ C_a \\Delta = a C_a - a C_i + b C_i = a(C_a - C_i) + b C_i $$\nDividing by $C_a$ gives the expression for $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta = a \\frac{C_a - C_i}{C_a} + b \\frac{C_i}{C_a} $$\nThis expression can be rearranged into the required linear form as a function of $C_i/C_a$:\n$$ \\Delta = a\\left(1 - \\frac{C_i}{C_a}\\right) + b \\frac{C_i}{C_a} = a - a \\frac{C_i}{C_a} + b \\frac{C_i}{C_a} $$\n$$ \\Delta = a + (b-a)\\frac{C_i}{C_a} $$\nThis is the explicit linear expression for $\\Delta$.\n\n(b) We are asked to express intrinsic water-use efficiency, iWUE, in terms of $C_a$, $a$, $b$, and $\\Delta$.\nThe definition of iWUE is given as:\n$$ \\text{iWUE} = \\frac{A}{g_{sw}} $$\nWe are given the relations $A = g_{sc}(C_a - C_i)$ and $g_{sw} = 1.6 \\, g_{sc}$.\nSubstituting these into the iWUE definition:\n$$ \\text{iWUE} = \\frac{g_{sc}(C_a - C_i)}{1.6 \\, g_{sc}} $$\nThe term $g_{sc}$ cancels:\n$$ \\text{iWUE} = \\frac{C_a - C_i}{1.6} = \\frac{C_a}{1.6} \\left(1 - \\frac{C_i}{C_a}\\right) $$\nFrom part (a), we have the expression $\\Delta = a + (b-a)\\frac{C_i}{C_a}$. We must rearrange this to solve for the ratio $C_i/C_a$:\n$$ \\Delta - a = (b-a)\\frac{C_i}{C_a} \\implies \\frac{C_i}{C_a} = \\frac{\\Delta - a}{b - a} $$\nNow, substitute this expression for $C_i/C_a$ into the equation for iWUE:\n$$ \\text{iWUE} = \\frac{C_a}{1.6} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta - a}{b - a}\\right) $$\nTo simplify the term in parentheses:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{\\Delta - a}{b - a} = \\frac{(b - a) - (\\Delta - a)}{b - a} = \\frac{b - a - \\Delta + a}{b - a} = \\frac{b - \\Delta}{b - a} $$\nTherefore, the final expression for iWUE is:\n$$ \\text{iWUE} = \\frac{C_a}{1.6} \\left(\\frac{b - \\Delta}{b - a}\\right) $$\n\n(c) We must evaluate the iWUE numerically.\nThe given values are:\n$\\Delta = 19.7$ parts per thousand\n$C_a = 40.5 \\, \\text{Pa}$\n$a = 4.4$ parts per thousand\n$b = 27$ parts per thousand\n\nWe use the formula derived in part (b).
