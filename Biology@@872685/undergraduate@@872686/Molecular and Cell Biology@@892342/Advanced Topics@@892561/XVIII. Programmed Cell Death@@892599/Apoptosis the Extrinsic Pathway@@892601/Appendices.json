This pathway is initiated when an external signaling molecule, a death ligand, binds to a death receptor on the cell's surface. In this particular mutant cell line, there is a specific loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the Fas-Associated Death Domain (FADD) protein. This mutation completely disrupts the three-dimensional structure of FADD's C-terminal Death Domain (DD), rendering it unable to participate in protein-protein interactions. However, the N-terminal Death Effector Domain (DED) of the mutant FADD protein remains structurally intact and functional.\n\nThese mutant cells are then treated with an appropriate death ligand, Fas Ligand (FasL), which successfully binds to its corresponding Fas Receptor (FasR) and causes the receptors to cluster on the cell membrane. Despite this initial activation step, the apoptotic cascade fails to proceed.\n\nWhich of the following molecular events is the most direct cause of the observed failure to induce apoptosis in these mutant cells?\n\nA. The binding of the FADD adaptor protein to the activated FasR.\n\nB. The cleavage and activation of executioner caspase-3.\n\nC. The recruitment of procaspase-8 to the FADD adaptor protein.\n\nD. The binding of the FasL to the FasR.\n\nE. The release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol.", "solution": "The extrinsic pathway of apoptosis initiated by FasL-FasR proceeds through the following ordered molecular interactions:\n- FasL binds FasR and induces receptor trimerization and clustering at the membrane.\n- The cytoplasmic Death Domain (DD) of FasR engages the DD of the adaptor protein FADD via DD-DD interactions.\n- The N-terminal Death Effector Domain (DED) of FADD then recruits procaspase-8 through DED-DED interactions to form the Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC).\n- Within the DISC, procaspase-8 is activated, which subsequently activates executioner caspases such as caspase-3, leading to apoptosis.\n\nIn the mutant described, the C-terminal DD of FADD is structurally disrupted, while the N-terminal DED remains intact. Consequently:\n- FasL binding to FasR and receptor clustering occur normally.\n- However, the next obligatory step—DD-mediated binding of FADD to the activated FasR—cannot occur because FADD’s DD is nonfunctional.\n- Without FADD binding to FasR, DISC assembly fails; thus, even though the DED is intact, procaspase-8 cannot be recruited to the receptor complex.\n- Downstream events such as caspase-8 activation and caspase-3 cleavage therefore do not occur, but these failures are secondary to the lack of FADD recruitment to FasR.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A identifies the specific step that is immediately blocked by the DD loss-of-function mutation; this is the most direct cause of failure.\n- C (procaspase-8 recruitment) also fails but is a consequence of A; it is less direct given the intact DED.\n- B (caspase-3 activation) is downstream.\n- D (FasL binding) occurs normally.\n- E (cytochrome c release) pertains to the intrinsic pathway and is not the primary defect here.\n\nTherefore, the most direct cause is the failure of FADD to bind the activated FasR via DD-DD interaction, corresponding to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2304356"}, {"introduction": "A key goal in cell biology research is to find experimental evidence for cellular processes, moving from conceptual models to tangible data. This practice [@problem_id:2304314] asks you to interpret the results of a Western blot, a foundational technique for analyzing proteins.

The researcher hypothesizes that Compound Y induces apoptosis in lymphoma cells by activating the extrinsic pathway. To test this, they treat a culture of lymphoma cells with Compound Y for several hours. They then lyse the cells, collect the total protein, and perform a Western blot analysis using an antibody that specifically recognizes caspase-8. The activation of the extrinsic pathway involves the formation of a Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC), which leads to the activation of the initiator caspase, procaspase-8.\n\nAssuming the researcher's hypothesis is correct, which of the following observations on the Western blot would provide the most direct evidence for the activation of caspase-8?\n\nA. A decrease in the band corresponding to procaspase-8 and the appearance of new, smaller bands.\n\nB. A significant increase in the intensity of the single band corresponding to procaspase-8.\n\nC. A shift to a higher molecular weight for the band corresponding to caspase-8, indicating its phosphorylation.\n\nD. The complete disappearance of all bands recognized by the caspase-8 antibody, indicating its degradation.\n\nE. The appearance of a single, very high molecular weight band, suggesting aggregation of procaspase-8.", "solution": "The extrinsic apoptotic pathway is initiated by ligand binding to death receptors, leading to assembly of the Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC). DISC recruits adaptor proteins (such as FADD) and procaspase-8. Activation of procaspase-8 occurs via proximity-induced dimerization and autocatalytic proteolytic cleavage. Proteolytic activation converts the inactive zymogen (procaspase-8) into active caspase-8 composed of cleaved subunits (commonly referred to as p18 and p10), which appear as lower molecular weight bands on a Western blot. Therefore, the most direct biochemical evidence of caspase-8 activation on a Western blot probed with a caspase-8 antibody is a reduction in the intensity of the full-length procaspase-8 band together with the appearance of smaller cleavage products.\n\nOption A describes exactly this pattern: a decrease in the procaspase-8 band with the appearance of new, smaller bands corresponding to cleaved, active caspase-8. Option B indicates accumulation of procaspase-8 without activation (no cleavage). Option C suggests phosphorylation and a higher apparent molecular weight, which is not the canonical mechanism of caspase activation. Option D indicates complete degradation, which is not specific for activation and would eliminate detection of both zymogen and cleaved forms. Option E suggests aggregation into a very high molecular weight species, which is not a hallmark of activation and would not represent functional caspase-8.\n\nThus, the most direct evidence for activation of caspase-8 is the appearance of cleaved, lower molecular weight bands with a concurrent decrease in the procaspase-8 band.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2304314"}, {"introduction": "The interactions governing apoptosis are not simple on/off switches; they are dynamic equilibria governed by concentrations and binding affinities.

By applying principles of chemical equilibrium, you will learn how mathematical models can predict the outcomes of complex molecular competitions within the cell.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating the mechanism by which a virus inhibits apoptosis in host cells. The extrinsic apoptosis pathway is initiated when a ligand binds to a death receptor, leading to the recruitment of an adaptor protein, Fas-Associated protein with Death Domain (FADD).

This assembly of the Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC) leads to the activation of procaspase-8 and commitment to cell death.\n\nThe virus under study produces a viral FLICE-inhibitory protein (v-FLIP), which mimics procaspase-8 by also containing DEDs. This allows v-FLIP to compete with procaspase-8 for binding to FADD, thereby preventing the formation of a functional DISC and blocking apoptosis.\n\nTo quantify this competitive interaction, the biologist prepares an in-vitro-reconstituted system in a buffer solution at physiological conditions.
