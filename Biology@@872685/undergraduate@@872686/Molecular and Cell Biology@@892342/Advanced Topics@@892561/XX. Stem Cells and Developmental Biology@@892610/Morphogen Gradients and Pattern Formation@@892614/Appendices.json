Fintin is a secreted protein produced by a small group of cells located at the posterior-most tip of the developing fin tissue. It diffuses away from this source, establishing a stable concentration gradient that is highest at the posterior end and lowest at the anterior end.\n\nThe fate of a cell within the fin tissue is determined by the local concentration of Fintin it experiences. This concentration-dependent response is governed by two thresholds, $C_L$ and $C_H$:\n- If the Fintin concentration is above $C_H$, the cell differentiates into a structural \"Ray cell\".\n- If the Fintin concentration is between $C_L$ and $C_H$, the cell differentiates into a flexible \"Web cell\".\n- If the Fintin concentration is below $C_L$, the cell differentiates into a protective \"Epidermal cell\".\n\nIn the wild-type organism, this mechanism produces a functional fin with a posterior block of Ray cells, a central band of Web cells, and an anterior region of Epidermal cells.\n\nConsider a rare genetic mutation that affects the Fintin receptor protein. This mutation causes the receptor to become **constitutively active**, meaning it perpetually activates its downstream intracellular signaling pathway at the maximum possible level, even in the complete absence of the Fintin morphogen.\n\nAssuming all cells in the developing fin express this mutant receptor, what is the most likely phenotype of the fin in an individual that is homozygous for this constitutively active receptor mutation?\n\nA. The entire fin tissue will be composed of Ray cells.\n\nB. The entire fin tissue will be composed of Epidermal cells.\n\nC. The patterning of the fin will be inverted, with Ray cells at the anterior and Epidermal cells at the posterior.\n\nD. The fin will exhibit a normal pattern of Ray, Web, and Epidermal cells, but will be much smaller than in a wild-type larva.\n\nE. The fin tissue will fail to form entirely, resulting in a larva with no fin.", "solution": "Let $x$ denote position along the fin from posterior (source) to anterior, and let $C(x)$ be the steady-state Fintin concentration profile with $C(x)$ strictly decreasing with increasing $x$.

The fate thresholds stated in terms of $C(x)$ correspond to signaling thresholds $f(C_L)$ and $f(C_H)$. In wild type, posterior cells have $C(x) > C_H$ and thus $S(x) \\geq f(C_H)$ (Ray), intermediate cells have $f(C_L) \\leq S(x) \\leq f(C_H)$ (Web), and anterior cells have $S(x)  f(C_L)$ (Epidermal).\n\nUnder the constitutively active receptor mutation, by assumption the receptor produces maximal signaling output independent of ligand, so for all $x$,\n$$\nS(x) = S_{\\max},\n$$\neven if $C(x)=0$. Since $S_{\\max}$ equals the maximum pathway activity attainable, it corresponds to an effective perception of a concentration at or above the high threshold, i.e. there exists an effective $C_{\\text{eff}}(x)$ such that $f(C_{\\text{eff}}(x)) = S_{\\max}$ with $C_{\\text{eff}}(x) \\geq C_H$ for all $x$. Therefore, for every cell position,\n$$\nS(x) = S_{\\max} \\geq f(C_H) \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\text{fate} = \\text{Ray cell}.\n$$\n\nThis yields a uniform high-signal fate across the entire fin. By the given rules, a uniform outcome above $C_H$ produces only Ray cells. This excludes:\n- B, which would require $S(x)$ to be uniformly below $f(C_L)$ (the opposite of constitutive activation).\n- C, which would require inversion of the gradient; instead, signaling is uniform and maximal, not inverted.\n- D, which would require preservation of graded thresholds; constitutive maximal signaling collapses patterning to a single fate, not three zones.\n- E, which would require failure of fin formation; the rules specify fates under high signal (Ray), not an absence of differentiation.\n\nThus the most likely phenotype is that the entire fin tissue is composed of Ray cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2325643"}, {"introduction": "Having established the importance of signal interpretation, we now turn to the properties of the gradient itself.
