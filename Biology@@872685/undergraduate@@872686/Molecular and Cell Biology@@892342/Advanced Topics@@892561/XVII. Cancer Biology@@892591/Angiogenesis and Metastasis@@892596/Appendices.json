By analyzing a hypothetical clinical scenario, you will practice distinguishing the direct biophysical consequence of losing this adhesion molecule from other downstream events in tumor progression.", "problem": "An oncologist is studying a biopsy from an epithelial tumor. Genetic analysis of the cancerous cells reveals a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the *CDH1* gene. This gene encodes the protein E-cadherin, a transmembrane glycoprotein essential for the formation of adherens junctions between epithelial cells. The oncologist notes that this specific mutation is a primary indicator that the tumor may be transitioning towards a malignant, metastatic phenotype.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate and primary consequence of this specific genetic alteration that contributes to the initiation of the metastatic cascade?\n\nA. The mutation enhances the secretion of signaling molecules, such as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), which triggers the formation of new blood vessels to supply the tumor.\n\nB. The mutation disrupts the calcium-dependent homophilic binding between adjacent cancer cells, leading to a loss of intercellular adhesion and allowing individual cells to dissociate from the primary tumor mass.\n\nC. The mutation leads to the inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway, thereby preventing the cancer cells from undergoing programmed cell death (apoptosis) once they have detached.\n\nD. The mutation causes a significant upregulation in the expression and secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes that actively degrade the basement membrane and surrounding extracellular matrix.\n\nE. The mutation directly alters intracellular signaling pathways, leading to a dramatic and uncontrolled increase in the rate of cell proliferation, causing the tumor to grow much faster.", "solution": "E-cadherin, encoded by the CDH1 gene, is a transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates adherens junctions in epithelial tissues. Its extracellular domain forms calcium-dependent homophilic interactions with E-cadherin on adjacent cells, while its intracellular domain binds catenins (such as beta-catenin and alpha-catenin) to link to the actin cytoskeleton, creating stable intercellular adhesion.\n\nA homozygous loss-of-function mutation in CDH1 eliminates functional E-cadherin from the cell surface. The immediate and primary biophysical consequence is the loss of calcium-dependent homophilic binding between neighboring epithelial cells, which disrupts adherens junctions. This reduces intercellular cohesion, allowing individual tumor cells to detach from the primary epithelial sheet. This detachment is a key initiating event in the metastatic cascade and is characteristic of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- Option A (VEGF upregulation and angiogenesis) describes a later event in tumor progression and is not a direct consequence of E-cadherin loss.\n- Option B directly describes the immediate loss of calcium-dependent homophilic adhesion mediated by E-cadherin, leading to cell dissociation, which is the primary and proximal effect.\n- Option C (p53 pathway inactivation) is unrelated mechanistically to CDH1/E-cadherin loss as an immediate consequence.\n- Option D (MMP upregulation) is a downstream effect that may occur during invasion/EMT but is not the immediate primary consequence of losing E-cadherin.\n- Option E (direct increase in proliferation) is not the primary effect of E-cadherin loss; while E-cadherin can influence signaling, the proximal consequence is adhesion loss, not a dramatic proliferation surge.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that the mutation disrupts calcium-dependent homophilic binding and intercellular adhesion, enabling detachment from the primary tumor mass.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2303931"}, {"introduction": "For a tumor to grow beyond a few millimeters, it must recruit its own blood supply through a process called angiogenesis.
