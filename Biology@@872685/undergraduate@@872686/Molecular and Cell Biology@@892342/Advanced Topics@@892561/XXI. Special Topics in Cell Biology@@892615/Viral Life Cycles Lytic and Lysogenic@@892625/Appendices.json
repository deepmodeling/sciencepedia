To ensure the efficacy and safety of the final product, the concentration of active phage particles in the stock solution must be accurately determined. The researcher performs a serial dilution of the phage stock and then conducts a plaque assay. In this procedure, a small volume of a diluted phage solution is mixed with a large number of host bacteria and spread onto a nutrient agar plate. Each viable phage infects a bacterium, replicates, and lyses it, releasing progeny phages that infect and lyse surrounding bacteria. This chain reaction creates a clear, circular zone of clearing called a plaque on the otherwise opaque lawn of bacterial growth.\n\nThe researcher takes $0.100$ mL from the $10^{-6}$ dilution tube and plates it. After incubation, a count of the plaques on the plate reveals 45 distinct clearings.

By examining the consequences of mutations in key regulatory genes, we can dissect the logic of this biological circuit. This problem [@problem_id:2347484] explores what happens when the primary protein responsible for maintaining lysogeny, the cI repressor, is non-functional, providing a clear window into its critical role.", "problem": "In the life cycle of the bacteriophage lambda, the decision to enter either the lytic or lysogenic pathway is controlled by a delicate genetic switch. This switch primarily involves the interplay between two key regulatory proteins encoded by the phage genome: the cI repressor and the Cro protein. The cI repressor protein promotes the lysogenic state by repressing the transcription of genes required for the lytic cycle. Conversely, the Cro protein promotes the lytic cycle by repressing the synthesis of the cI repressor.\n\nA molecular biologist creates a mutant strain of bacteriophage lambda. This mutant possesses a *null mutation* in the *cI* gene, which completely prevents the synthesis of any functional cI repressor protein. A population of susceptible, healthy *E. coli* cells in a nutrient-rich medium is then infected with this mutant phage.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected outcome for a cell infected by this mutant phage?\n\nA. The phage will be unable to inject its genetic material into the host bacterium.\n\nB. The phage will be obligately lysogenic, immediately integrating its genome into the host chromosome.\n\nC. The phage will be obligately lytic and will not be able to establish lysogeny.\n\nD. The phage genome will be circularized but will remain inert within the host cell cytoplasm, unable to initiate either life cycle.\n\nE. The choice between lytic and lysogenic cycles will now be determined solely by the host cell's metabolic state, bypassing the need for cI.", "solution": "We analyze the genetic switch controlling lytic versus lysogenic development in bacteriophage lambda, focusing on the roles of the cI repressor and Cro. In wild-type lambda, early after infection, transcription from promoters $P_{L}$ and $P_{R}$ produces regulators including N, Cro, and, via the CII/CIII pathway, activation of the $P_{RE}$ promoter that drives cI expression to establish lysogeny. The cI repressor, once present, shuts down $P_{L}$ and $P_{R}$ to block lytic functions and activates $P_{RM}$ to maintain its own expression, thereby stabilizing the lysogenic state.\n\nConsider the mutant with a null mutation in cI that prevents synthesis of any functional cI repressor protein:\n1. Upon infection, DNA injection and circularization are unaffected by cI status, so the phage genome enters the host and can be transcribed from $P_{L}$ and $P_{R}$.\n2. In the absence of functional cI protein, there is no repression of $P_{L}$ and $P_{R}$, so early lytic genes, including cro, are expressed.\n3. Cro represses $P_{RM}$, which prevents maintenance or initiation of cI expression from its maintenance promoter, further ensuring that no active cI accumulates.\n4. Even if host conditions favor CII activity, activation of $P_{RE}$ cannot rescue the phenotype because the cI coding sequence is null; therefore, establishment of lysogeny is impossible.\n5. Without cI, the lytic program proceeds: antitermination (N, Q), DNA replication, late gene expression, and lysis occur. Maintenance or establishment of lysogeny cannot occur because the essential repressor is absent.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because cI does not control DNA injection.\n- B is incorrect because lysogeny requires cI; without it, lysogeny cannot be established or maintained.\n- C is correct: the phage is obligately lytic and cannot establish lysogeny.\n- D is incorrect: the genome will not remain inert; lytic transcription proceeds.\n- E is incorrect because although host metabolic state influences CII stability, lysogeny still requires functional cI; there is no bypass.\n\nTherefore, the expected outcome is obligate lysis with an inability to establish lysogeny.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2347484"}, {"introduction": "Observing that a host cell has survived a phage infection does not definitively prove lysogeny; the phage might have simply failed to infect. To confirm that a phage has integrated its DNA to become a prophage, we need a molecular test. This practice problem [@problem_id:2347503] challenges you to think like an experimentalist by designing a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay to definitively prove the physical linkage between phage and host DNA, a key skill in molecular genetics.", "problem": "A team of microbiologists is investigating the life cycle of a newly discovered temperate bacteriophage, designated Phage Z, which exclusively infects the bacterium *Astroides hydrogenophilus*. The bacterium possesses a single, circular chromosome of 4.2 million base pairs (bp). The linear genome of Phage Z is 38,000 bp long. Through genetic mapping, the researchers have determined that Phage Z integrates its genome into the bacterial chromosome at a single, specific attachment site, known as the *attB* site, located at coordinate 3,105,400 on the bacterial chromosome.\n\nTo verify the formation of a lysogen (a bacterium containing an integrated prophage), the team designs a specific diagnostic test using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), a technique used to amplify a specific segment of DNA. They synthesize two primers for this purpose:\n- **Primer Fwd**: A forward primer that anneals to the bacterial chromosome. Its\n3' end, from which DNA synthesis begins, is located at chromosome coordinate 3,105,150.\n- **Primer Rev**: A reverse primer that anneals to the phage genome. Its 3' end is located at a position corresponding to 225 bp from the end of the phage genome that initially inserts into the bacterial chromosome.\n\nAssuming that Phage Z has successfully integrated into the *Astroides hydrogenophilus* chromosome to form a prophage, what is the expected size of the DNA fragment that will be amplified by this specific PCR experiment? Express your answer in base pairs (bp).", "solution": "The core principle of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is the amplification of a specific DNA segment located between a forward primer and a reverse primer. For an amplification product to be generated, the two primers must bind to the same continuous stretch of template DNA, oriented such that they point towards each other.\n\nIn this problem, one primer (Primer Fwd) binds to the bacterial chromosome, and the other primer (Primer Rev) binds to the phage genome. In a culture of uninfected bacteria or in a mixture containing only free phage particles, these two primers target separate DNA molecules. Therefore, no PCR product would be formed under these conditions.\n\nHowever, the problem statement asks for the result assuming the phage has entered the lysogenic cycle and integrated its genome into the bacterial chromosome. This integration event creates a single, larger, continuous DNA molecule (the bacterial chromosome now containing the prophage). This physical linkage makes it possible for the PCR to amplify a fragment spanning the junction between the bacterial and phage DNA.\n\nLet's determine the boundaries of the DNA segment to be amplified. The amplified region starts at the 3' end of the forward primer and ends at the 3' end of the reverse primer.\n\n1.  **Identify the location of the forward primer's 3' end:** Primer Fwd's 3' end is at coordinate 3,105,150 on the bacterial chromosome.\n\n2.  **Identify the location of the integration site:** The phage genome integrates at the *attB* site, which is at coordinate 3,105,400 on the bacterial chromosome.\n\n3.  **Calculate the length of the amplified segment from the bacterial genome:** This is the distance from the forward primer's 3' end to the integration junction.\n    Length_bacterial = |Integration site coordinate - Primer Fwd coordinate|\n    Length_bacterial = |3,105,400 bp - 3,105,150 bp| = 250 bp.\n\n4.  **Identify the location of the reverse primer's 3' end:** Primer Rev's 3' end is located 225 bp into the phage genome, measured from the point of integration.\n\n5.  **Calculate the length of the amplified segment from the phage genome:** This is the distance from the integration junction to the reverse primer's 3' end.\n    Length_phage = 225 bp.\n\n6.  **Calculate the total size of the PCR product:** The total amplified fragment will be the sum of the segment from the bacterial DNA and the segment from the phage DNA.\n    Total size = Length_bacterial + Length_phage\n    Total size = 250 bp + 225 bp = 475 bp.\n\nTherefore, if the phage has successfully integrated, the PCR experiment using Primer Fwd and Primer Rev will produce a DNA fragment of 475 base pairs.
