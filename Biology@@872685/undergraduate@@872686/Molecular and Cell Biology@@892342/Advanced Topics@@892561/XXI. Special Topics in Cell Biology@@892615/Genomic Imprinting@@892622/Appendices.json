{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding genomic imprinting begins with mastering its specific terminology, which can sometimes be counterintuitive. This first exercise [@problem_id:1494601] directly addresses a common point of confusion: the distinction between a gene that is \"maternally imprinted\" and one that is \"maternally expressed.\" Correctly interpreting this language is the foundational skill needed to solve any problem involving parent-of-origin effects.", "problem": "In mammals, genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon that causes genes to be expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. This process involves DNA and histone modifications that silence one of the two parental alleles. Consider a hypothetical gene, *Gene X*, which is essential for normal embryonic development. *Gene X* is known to be maternally imprinted. Assuming normal inheritance and expression patterns, which of the following statements accurately describes the activity of *Gene X* in a healthy offspring?\n\nA. The allele for *Gene X* inherited from the mother is expressed.\n\nB. The allele for *Gene X* inherited from the father is expressed.\n\nC. Both the maternal and paternal alleles for *Gene X* are expressed.\n\nD. Neither the maternal nor the paternal allele for *Gene X* is expressed.\n\nE. The expression of *Gene X* depends on the sex of the offspring, with males expressing one allele and females expressing the other.", "solution": "Genomic imprinting is a parent-of-origin-specific epigenetic regulation in which one parental allele is silenced via DNA methylation and histone modifications, resulting in monoallelic expression. The key principle is that the term \"maternally imprinted\" means the allele inherited from the mother carries silencing marks and is not expressed, while the paternal allele is not imprinted and therefore is expressed.\n\nApplying this to Gene X:\n- Gene X is maternally imprinted, so the maternal allele is silenced.\n- Consequently, in a healthy offspring with normal imprinting, only the paternal allele of Gene X is active.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the maternal allele is silenced.\n- B is correct because the paternal allele is expressed.\n- C is incorrect because imprinting leads to monoallelic, not biallelic, expression.\n- D is incorrect because one allele (paternal) is expressed in normal imprinting.\n- E is incorrect because imprinting depends on parent of origin, not the sex of the offspring.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1494601"}, {"introduction": "With a clear grasp of the terminology, we can now explore how imprinting alters expected Mendelian inheritance patterns. This practice problem [@problem_id:1935197] uses a classic genetic technique—the reciprocal cross—to reveal the functional consequences of parent-of-origin-specific gene silencing. By comparing outcomes when a lethal allele is inherited from the mother versus the father, you will see how imprinting creates dramatically different results from crosses that would otherwise be genetically equivalent.", "problem": "In a species of bioluminescent fungus, a gene called *Luminase* is essential for embryonic development. There are two alleles for this gene: a functional wild-type allele, $L$, and a non-functional, recessive lethal allele, $l$. This gene is subject to genomic imprinting. Specifically, the paternal copy of the *Luminase* gene is always methylated and silenced, meaning only the allele inherited from the maternal parent is expressed in the offspring. Therefore, the allele $l$ is lethal only when inherited from the mother. Heterozygous individuals ($Ll$) are phenotypically normal and fully viable.\n\nConsider two reciprocal crosses:\n\n**Cross 1:** A heterozygous ($Ll$) female is crossed with a wild-type homozygous ($LL$) male.\n**Cross 2:** A wild-type homozygous ($LL$) female is crossed with a heterozygous ($Ll$) male.\n\nWhat are the expected proportions of viable offspring produced from Cross 1 and Cross 2, respectively?\n\nA. 1/2 and 1\n\nB. 1 and 1/2\n\nC. 1/2 and 1/2\n\nD. 3/4 and 1\n\nE. 1 and 3/4\n\nF. 3/4 and 3/4", "solution": "Genomic imprinting here silences the paternal allele; thus only the maternal allele is expressed. Let $L$ denote the functional allele and $l$ the non-functional, recessive lethal allele. Because only the maternal allele is expressed, an offspring is viable if and only if the maternal allele is $L$, and it is lethal if the maternal allele is $l$, regardless of the paternal genotype.\n\nCross 1: Female $Ll$ and male $LL$. The female produces eggs carrying $L$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $l$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. The male produces sperm carrying $L$ only. Offspring from maternal $L$ receive an expressed $L$ and are viable; offspring from maternal $l$ receive an expressed $l$ and are non-viable. Therefore, the proportion of viable offspring is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nCross 2: Female $LL$ and male $Ll$. The female produces eggs carrying $L$ only. Thus, every offspring has maternal allele $L$ expressed, regardless of the paternal allele, and is viable. Therefore, the proportion of viable offspring is $1$.\n\nThese correspond to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1935197"}, {"introduction": "Moving from classical genetics to modern molecular biology, our final practice delves into how scientists identify new imprinted genes using high-throughput technologies. This problem [@problem_id:2317408] introduces the two key molecular signatures of imprinting: monoallelic expression, measured by RNA-sequencing, and parent-specific DNA methylation, measured by bisulfite sequencing. By analyzing and integrating these two data types, you will apply the quantitative methods that are at the forefront of epigenetic research.", "problem": "A molecular biology research group is investigating genomic imprinting in the mouse placenta. They have performed a genome-wide screen combining RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and haplotype-resolved Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) on placental tissue from F1 hybrid mice derived from a cross between two inbred strains (Strain A female x Strain B male). Their goal is to identify novel imprinted genes by looking for two key signatures: parent-of-origin-specific gene expression and parent-of-origin-specific DNA methylation.\n\nThey are currently analyzing a candidate gene, which they have named *Transcribed Placental Locus 7* (*Tpl7*). Within an exon of *Tpl7*, there exists a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) that differs between the parental strains, allowing for allele-specific expression analysis. At the promoter of *Tpl7*, there is a CpG island, a region rich in cytosine-guanine dinucleotides.\n\nThe analysis pipeline defines an \"Imprinting Score\" (IS) for any given gene, calculated as the product of two other metrics: the Allelic Expression Imbalance (AEI) and the Differential Methylation Index (DMI).\n- The AEI is defined as the absolute value of the difference between the fraction of RNA-seq reads originating from the maternal allele and the fraction originating from the paternal allele. The fractions are calculated relative to the total number of reads mapping to the SNP.\n- The DMI is defined as the absolute difference between the average methylation level (expressed as a decimal) of the CpG island on the maternal allele and that on the paternal allele.\n\nFrom their sequencing data for the *Tpl7* gene in the F1 hybrid placenta, the researchers obtained the following results:\n- **RNA-seq at the exonic SNP:** A total of 8,240 reads mapped to this locus. Of these, 7,828 reads corresponded to the maternal allele (Strain A) and the remaining reads corresponded to the paternal allele (Strain B).\n- **WGBS at the promoter CpG island:** The average methylation level of the maternal allele was 0.915 (or 91.5%). The average methylation level of the paternal allele was 0.065 (or 6.5%).\n\nBased on this data, calculate the Imprinting Score (IS) for the *Tpl7* gene.
