{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The power of gel electrophoresis lies in its ability to separate molecules, but achieving clear separation, or resolution, depends on thoughtful experimental design. A critical parameter in DNA analysis is the concentration of the agarose gel itself, which determines the pore size of the molecular sieve. This practice challenges you to think like an experimentalist, choosing the right tool for the job to distinguish between two DNA fragments that are very close in size [@problem_id:2317042]. Mastering this concept is key to designing experiments that yield clean, unambiguous results.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is conducting a genotyping experiment on mice using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The experiment aims to distinguish between a wild-type allele and a mutant allele of a particular gene. The PCR amplification of the wild-type allele produces a DNA fragment of 400 base pairs (bp). The mutant allele contains a small deletion, resulting in a shorter PCR product of 350 bp. To determine if a mouse is homozygous wild-type (one 400 bp band), homozygous mutant (one 350 bp band), or heterozygous (both a 350 bp and a 400 bp band), the biologist must separate and visualize the PCR products using agarose gel electrophoresis. The primary challenge is to achieve clear resolution between the 350 bp and 400 bp fragments in the sample from a potentially heterozygous mouse. Which of the following agarose gel concentrations would be the most effective choice for this purpose?\n\nA. 0.7% agarose\n\nB. 1.2% agarose\n\nC. 2.0% agarose\n\nD. 3.5% agarose", "solution": "We need to resolve two DNA fragments of lengths $350$ bp and $400$ bp. The relative size difference is\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{rel}}=\\frac{400-350}{400}=\\frac{50}{400}=\\frac{1}{8},\n$$\nso clear separation requires good resolution in the few-hundred-base-pair range.\n\nPrinciple: In agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA mobility depends on fragment length via a sieving mechanism; higher agarose concentration decreases pore size and improves resolution of smaller fragments, while lower concentration favors separation of larger fragments. Empirically, gels with lower concentration are best for kilobase-scale fragments, and higher concentration is best for fragments below about $1000$ bp. However, excessively high concentration can impede migration, increase run time, and cause band distortion without appreciable benefit at the $350$–$400$ bp range.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A (low concentration) provides large pores, suitable for large fragments, and gives poor resolution for fragments near a few hundred bp with a small size difference.\n- Option B (moderate concentration) improves resolution compared to A but is still suboptimal for tightly spaced bands at a few hundred bp.\n- Option C (higher concentration appropriate for small fragments) is commonly used to resolve fragments in the $100$–$700$ bp range and provides sufficient resolving power to distinguish a $50$ bp difference near $350$–$400$ bp.\n- Option D (very high concentration) is typically used for very small fragments (tens to low hundreds of bp) and often results in very slow migration and practical issues (e.g., heat and band distortion) for fragments around $350$–$400$ bp, making it less effective in practice than Option C for this specific need.\n\nTherefore, the most effective choice among the options for resolving $350$ bp and $400$ bp PCR products is Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2317042"}, {"introduction": "Once you have run a gel, the next step is often to move beyond qualitative observation and extract precise, quantitative data. This practice demonstrates how to determine the exact size of an unknown DNA fragment by using a set of known standards, or a \"DNA ladder,\" run in an adjacent lane.
