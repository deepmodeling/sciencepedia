The plasmid is known to be a single species of circular DNA, meaning all molecules should have the identical sequence and length. The student takes a small aliquot of this purified, circular plasmid DNA, and without performing any restriction enzyme digestion, loads it into a well of an agarose gel for electrophoresis. After the gel is run and stained with a DNA-intercalating dye, the student is surprised to see three distinct bands in the lane corresponding to their sample.\n\nAssuming the purification procedure was performed correctly, yielding a chemically pure sample of the intended plasmid with no significant contamination, which of the following statements provides the most accurate explanation for the appearance of multiple bands?\n\nA. The high-salt buffer used for plasmid storage causes the plasmid to partially degrade into a set of discrete, smaller linear fragments, each producing a band.\n\nB. The bacterial culture was a mixed population containing three different plasmids, and the purification procedure successfully co-isolated all of them.\n\nC. A homogeneous population of circular plasmids can exist in different topological forms (isomers), such as supercoiled and relaxed-circular, which possess different three-dimensional shapes and thus migrate at different rates through the gel matrix.\n\nD. During sample preparation, the plasmid DNA spontaneously ligates with other plasmid molecules to form stable dimers and trimers of integer-multiple lengths, resulting in bands at higher molecular weights.\n\nE. The electric field applied during electrophoresis causes some of the circular plasmid molecules to break at a specific, weak point in their sequence, creating a single, linear species that runs alongside the original circular form.", "solution": "We analyze why undigested, circular plasmid DNA from a single, pure plasmid species yields three distinct bands on an agarose gel.\n\nFirst, a single plasmid species can adopt different topological states (topoisomers) without any change in sequence or length. The key biological principle is that covalently closed circular DNA can exist in distinct conformations depending on superhelical density and strand integrity:\n- Supercoiled (covalently closed, intact both strands; often called Form I). This is compact and migrates faster through agarose due to its smaller effective hydrodynamic radius.\n- Open circular or relaxed (nicked; one strand contains a single-strand break; often called Form II). Loss of superhelical tension makes the molecule more extended, so it migrates more slowly.\n- Linear (double-strand break; often called Form III). Its migration is typically intermediate relative to supercoiled and open circular of the same length in a standard agarose gel.\n\nTherefore, even a homogeneous population of plasmids by sequence naturally presents multiple bands because different topological forms migrate differently in the gel matrix, leading to discrete bands corresponding to supercoiled, linear, and nicked circular species.\n\nNow we evaluate the options:\n\nA is incorrect because high salt does not reproducibly create a discrete set of shorter linear fragments; random shearing or degradation would produce a smear rather than sharp bands at defined sizes.\n\nB is unlikely and inconsistent with starting from a single isolated colony and a known single plasmid species; co-isolation of multiple different plasmids would require a mixed culture, which contradicts the setup.\n\nC is correct. A homogeneous circular plasmid preparation commonly yields multiple discrete bands due to different topological forms (supercoiled, relaxed/nicked circular, and linear), which differ in shape and hence gel mobility.\n\nD is incorrect because spontaneous ligation into dimers/trimers during sample preparation would require ligase activity and a high-energy cofactor (e.g., ATP). Such multimer formation in vitro under standard miniprep storage and loading conditions is not expected and would not explain the canonical three-band pattern.\n\nE is incorrect because the electric field does not induce breakage at a specific site to yield a single, uniform linear species; any breakage would be random and typically lead to smearing or a distribution, not reproducible discrete bands aligned with the undigested circular forms.\n\nThus, the observation is best explained by different topological isomers of the same plasmid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2325226"}, {"introduction": "Once a cloning experiment is complete, you must verify that the gene was inserted correctly into the vector. Restriction enzyme digestion is a classic and powerful technique for this purpose, creating a unique 'fingerprint' for the plasmid. This practice [@problem_id:2325245] challenges you to predict the outcome of such a digest, a critical skill for designing and confirming any cloning strategy.", "problem": "A molecular biology student is performing a cloning experiment. The starting materials are a circular plasmid vector, pVEC, and a linear Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) fragment that will serve as the insert.\n\nThe pVEC plasmid has a total size of 3000 base pairs (bp). Its map contains a single recognition site for the restriction enzyme BamHI at position 500 and a single recognition site for the enzyme EcoRI at position 2200. The positions are numbered starting from a designated origin at position 0.\n\nThe linear DNA insert is 1200 bp in length. It contains a single internal EcoRI recognition site located 400 bp from its 5' end. For the cloning procedure, this insert has been engineered to have BamHI recognition sites at both its 5' and 3' ends.\n\nThe student first digests the pVEC plasmid with BamHI to linearize it. Then, the 1200 bp insert is ligated into the linearized pVEC, resulting in a new, larger circular recombinant plasmid.

Thus, in the recombinant circle there are:\n- two BamHI sites (at the two junctions),\n- one EcoRI site in the vector (at the original 2200 position within the 3000 bp vector arc),\n- one EcoRI site within the insert (400 bp from one BamHI junction along the 1200 bp insert).\n\nA complete double digest with BamHI and EcoRI makes four cuts on the circular plasmid, hence produces four fragments.\n\nFragment sizes are determined by cutting the two arcs between the BamHI junctions:\n\n1) Insert arc: length 1200 bp, cut once by EcoRI at 400 bp, giving two fragments\n$$\n400,\\quad 1200-400=800.\n$$\n\n2) Vector arc: length 3000 bp, cut once by EcoRI at position 2200 relative to the vector origin.

A common observation is the appearance of small 'satellite' colonies around a large, robust colony, which can be confusing. This problem [@problem_id:2325214] delves into the biochemical basis of ampicillin resistance to explain this phenomenon, sharpening your ability to troubleshoot and accurately interpret experimental outcomes.", "problem": "A molecular biology student performs a transformation experiment to introduce a plasmid into a strain of *E. coli* that is sensitive to the antibiotic ampicillin. The plasmid contains the ampicillin resistance gene, *bla*, which encodes the enzyme beta-lactamase. After the transformation procedure, the student plates the bacterial suspension onto a Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plate containing a concentration of ampicillin sufficient to kill non-transformed cells.\n\nAfter incubating the plate overnight, the student observes several large, well-formed colonies, indicating successful transformation. However, surrounding one of the largest colonies, the student also notices a distinct 'halo' composed of numerous much smaller colonies. These are commonly known as \"satellite colonies.\" Assuming the initial stock of *E. coli* was pure and the ampicillin concentration in the plate was initially uniform and correct, which of the following statements provides the most accurate explanation for the appearance of these satellite colonies?\n\nA. The large central colony began transferring the ampicillin-resistance plasmid to nearby non-transformed cells via conjugation, allowing them to grow.\n\nB. The large colony, composed of transformed cells, actively secretes the beta-lactamase enzyme into the surrounding agar. This enzyme degrades the ampicillin in the immediate vicinity, creating a zone where non-transformed, ampicillin-sensitive cells can survive and form small colonies.\n\nC. The satellite colonies arose from a few non-transformed cells that underwent spontaneous mutation, coincidentally acquiring ampicillin resistance and growing near the large colony.\n\nD. The non-transformed cells forming the satellite colonies established a symbiotic relationship with the central colony, exchanging nutrients that allowed them to collectively overcome the toxic effects of ampicillin.\n\nE. During the plating process, the ampicillin was not spread perfectly evenly, resulting in a small patch with a lower-than-lethal concentration of the antibiotic where satellite colonies could form.", "solution": "The plate contains ampicillin at a lethal concentration for non-transformed cells because ampicillin inhibits peptidoglycan cross-linking, causing death of cells lacking resistance. Transformed cells carry a plasmid with the bla gene encoding beta-lactamase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes the beta-lactam ring of ampicillin, thereby inactivating the antibiotic.\n\nA large, well-established transformed colony produces substantial beta-lactamase. Although beta-lactamase is localized to the periplasm, it is exported and can diffuse or leak into the surrounding agar. Enzymatic degradation of ampicillin near the colony creates a local concentration gradient of active antibiotic: close to the colony, the effective ampicillin concentration is reduced below the minimal inhibitory concentration for sensitive cells, permitting nearby non-transformed cells to survive long enough to form very small colonies. These appear as a halo of satellite colonies around the producer colony. This phenomenon is characteristic of ampicillin plates, especially after prolonged incubation, due to enzyme diffusion and degradation of ampicillin over time.\n\nAlternative explanations are less consistent with the observation:\n- Conjugation (option A) requires conjugative functions (tra genes) not present on standard lab cloning plasmids and would produce truly resistant progeny, not numerous tiny satellites limited to a halo around a single colony within the short incubation period.\n- Spontaneous mutation (option C) to ampicillin resistance is exceedingly rare, and the spatial clustering specifically around a single colony is inconsistent with random mutation.\n- A generic symbiotic nutrient exchange (option D) would not neutralize ampicillin; specific enzymatic inactivation is required.\n- Uneven ampicillin distribution (option E) would produce random patches across the plate, not a halo centered on a single colony; the problem also states the antibiotic was initially uniform and correct.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is that beta-lactamase secreted by the transformed colony degrades ampicillin locally, allowing nearby sensitive cells to grow as satellites.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2325214"}]}
