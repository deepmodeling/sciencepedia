This practice explores the crucial concept of passive immunity, where pre-made protection is transferred from one individual to another. By analyzing the presence of specific antibodies in a newborn, you will apply your knowledge to distinguish between immunity that is actively generated versus passively acquired, a vital distinction in clinical immunology [@problem_id:2320532].", "problem": "A healthy, full-term newborn infant is evaluated by a pediatrician. Blood tests reveal a significant concentration of pathogen-specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against a common environmental virus. The infant's mother has a well-documented history of immunity to this specific virus. This clinical finding is notable because a primary adaptive immune response in a neonate to a first-time pathogen exposure typically involves a much slower production of antibodies, which begins with the Immunoglobulin M (IgM) isotype.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate biological explanation for the presence of these specific IgG antibodies in the newborn's bloodstream?\n\nA. The infant's exceptionally mature immune system mounted a rapid primary response, allowing naive B cells to quickly undergo class switching from IgM to IgG production.\n\nB. The infant acquired these specific IgG antibodies from the mother, as IgG is the only antibody isotype capable of being transported across the placenta during gestation.\n\nC. Key cells of the infant's innate immune system, specifically macrophages and dendritic cells, were stimulated to produce pathogen-specific IgG upon exposure.\n\nD. Secretory antibodies, primarily Immunoglobulin A (IgA), were transferred to the infant through breastfeeding and were subsequently converted into the IgG isotype within the infant's circulatory system.", "solution": "We assess the biological source of pathogen-specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) detected in a newborn. The fundamental immunological principles involved are:\n- Primary adaptive responses begin with production of Immunoglobulin M (IgM) by naive B cells, followed by class switching to IgG, which requires T helper cell help, germinal center reactions, and time. In neonates, immune responses are slower and less robust, making rapid class switching unlikely during a first exposure.\n- Passive immunity in the fetus occurs via transplacental transport of maternal IgG mediated by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) in the placenta, especially during late gestation. Importantly, IgG is the only immunoglobulin isotype that efficiently crosses the placenta; IgM and IgA do not.\n- Antibodies are produced by B cells/plasma cells; innate immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells do not synthesize antibodies.\n- Breast milk provides secretory Immunoglobulin A (IgA), which primarily protects mucosal surfaces in the gastrointestinal tract and is not converted into IgG nor substantially transported into the infant’s bloodstream.\n\nEvaluate the options:\nA. Incorrect. A neonate’s primary response would start with IgM, and class switching to IgG would not occur rapidly in a first exposure; neonatal adaptive immunity is relatively immature.\nB. Correct. The infant acquired pathogen-specific IgG transplacentally from the mother; IgG is uniquely transported across the placenta, providing passive immunity that reflects the mother’s antigenic history.\nC. Incorrect. Macrophages and dendritic cells are innate immune cells and do not produce antibodies; antibody production is a function of B cells.\nD. Incorrect. Breastfeeding transfers predominantly secretory IgA, not IgG; there is no physiologic conversion of IgA to IgG within the infant’s circulation, and secretory IgA mainly acts in mucosal compartments.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is maternal transplacental transfer of IgG.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2320532"}, {"introduction": "Pathogens and host immune systems are locked in a perpetual evolutionary arms race, with viruses constantly developing new ways to evade detection. This thought experiment examines a common viral strategy: hiding from cytotoxic T cells by removing the cell-surface markers (MHC class I molecules) they use for recognition. This problem challenges you to identify the clever innate immune mechanism that has evolved to counter this exact trick, a principle known as \"missing-self\" recognition [@problem_id:2320577].", "problem": "A novel pathogen, designated Virus-X, has developed a sophisticated immune evasion strategy. Upon infecting a human epithelial cell, Virus-X expresses a unique protein that targets the host cell's Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules for degradation, effectively removing them from the cell surface. Despite this loss of MHC class I, the host's immune system is still capable of recognizing and efficiently eliminating these infected cells. This clearance is primarily mediated by a specific type of lymphocyte that operates as part of the innate immune system.\n\nWhich of the following statements best explains the immunological mechanism responsible for the elimination of Virus-X infected cells?\n\nA. Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) recognize viral peptides presented on the cell surface and induce apoptosis.\n\nB. Macrophages engulf the infected cells after recognizing stress-induced molecules on their surface through phagocytosis.\n\nC. Natural Killer (NK) cells are activated because the absence of MHC class I molecules removes a critical inhibitory signal, leading to the release of cytotoxic granules.\n\nD. Helper T cells release cytokines that directly lyse the infected cells.\n\nE. B cells generate antibodies that bind to the infected cells, marking them for destruction by the complement system.", "solution": "Key immunological principles:\n- MHC class I molecules are expressed on nearly all nucleated cells and present endogenous peptides to CD8^{+} cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Recognition by CTLs requires peptide-MHC class I complexes. Thus, if a virus downregulates or removes MHC class I, CTLs cannot recognize and kill the infected cells.\n- Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that integrate activating and inhibitory signals. A central inhibitory signal is delivered when NK inhibitory receptors (such as KIRs or CD94/NKG2A) engage self MHC class I. The \"missing self\" hypothesis states that the absence or reduction of MHC class I removes this inhibitory signal, allowing activating signals (e.g., through NKG2D binding to stress ligands) to predominate, triggering NK cytotoxicity via perforin and granzymes, leading to apoptosis of the target cell.\n- Macrophages primarily phagocytose opsonized or dying cells and are not the principal effectors for killing live virus-infected epithelial cells via recognition of missing self.\n- Helper T cells (CD4^{+}) provide cytokine help but do not directly lyse infected cells.\n- Antibody- and complement-mediated lysis is not the primary mechanism for eliminating nucleated host cells; complement is relatively ineffective at lysing healthy nucleated cells, and antibody responses target extracellular antigens or mediate ADCC, which still relies on effector cells like NK cells.\n\nApplication to the scenario:\n- Virus-X removes MHC class I from infected cells. This prevents CTL recognition (excluding option A).\n- The absence of MHC class I removes inhibitory signaling to NK cells, enabling NK activation and cytotoxic granule release (supporting option C).\n- Options B, D, and E do not align with the primary, well-established mechanism for surveillance of MHC class I loss.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is that NK cells detect the absence of MHC class I (\"missing self\"), leading to activation and killing via cytotoxic granules.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2320577"}, {"introduction": "A defining feature of adaptive immunity is the generation of immunological memory, which ensures a faster and more potent response upon subsequent encounters with the same pathogen.
