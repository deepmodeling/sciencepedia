This exercise demonstrates how a principle from classical optics—thin-film interference—provides a surprisingly accurate, real-time method for judging section thickness during ultramicrotomy. By learning to \"read\" the colors of sections floating on water, you can assess their suitability for high-resolution imaging before they even reach the microscope [@problem_id:2346591].", "problem": "A cell biology researcher is preparing a tissue sample for analysis with a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). The sample has been fixed, dehydrated, and embedded in an epoxy resin with a refractive index of $n_{resin} = 1.55$. Using an ultramicrotome, the researcher cuts sections from the resin block, which are then floated onto the surface of a water-filled trough ($n_{water} = 1.33$). When observing the sections under white light at near-normal incidence, they consistently display a bright, uniform gold color. This color indicates that light with a vacuum wavelength of approximately $\\lambda_{gold} = 600$ nm is being strongly reflected. For high-resolution ultrastructural analysis (e.g., resolving the detailed structure of ribosomes or membranes), the section thickness should ideally be no more than 70 nm.\n\nBased on the observed color, which of the following options provides the most accurate estimate for the section thickness and a correct assessment of its suitability for high-resolution TEM imaging? Assume the thinnest possible section that could produce this color.\n\nA. The estimated thickness is approximately 97 nm, which is unsuitable for high-resolution imaging.\n\nB.

Reflection at the air–resin interface (low to high index) incurs a phase shift of $\\pi$, while reflection at the resin–water interface (high to low index) incurs no phase shift. Therefore, there is a net $\\pi$ phase difference between the two reflected rays independent of thickness.\n\nFor a film with one phase inversion, constructive interference in reflection at vacuum wavelength $\\lambda_{0}$ occurs when the total phase difference equals an even multiple of $2\\pi$:\n$$\n\\frac{4\\pi n_{resin} t}{\\lambda_{0}} + \\pi = 2\\pi m,\n$$\nwhere $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ and $t$ is the film thickness.
