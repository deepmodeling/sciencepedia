By solving this problem [@problem_id:2343889], you will solidify your understanding of the relationship between the number of amino acid residues, $n$, and the $n-1$ covalent linkages that form the protein backbone.", "problem": "A hypothetical protein complex, known as the 'mitotic spindle regulator' (MSR), is crucial for cell division. The functional MSR complex is a heterotrimer, assembled from two identical Alpha subunits and one Beta subunit. Biochemical analysis has determined that a single Alpha subunit is a linear polypeptide chain composed of 115 amino acid residues, and the single Beta subunit is a linear polypeptide chain composed of 98 amino acid residues. Assuming the subunits associate non-covalently to form the final complex, calculate the total number of peptide bonds present in a single, functional MSR complex.", "solution": "A peptide bond is formed between adjacent amino acids during polymerization; therefore, a linear polypeptide chain with $n$ amino acid residues contains $n-1$ peptide bonds.\n\nFor one Alpha subunit with $115$ residues, the number of peptide bonds is:\n$$115 - 1 = 114.$$\nSince there are two identical Alpha subunits, their combined peptide bonds are:\n$$2 \\times 114 = 228.$$\n\nFor the single Beta subunit with $98$ residues, the number of peptide bonds is:\n$$98 - 1 = 97.$$\n\nBecause the subunits associate non-covalently, no additional peptide bonds are formed between subunits.

This charge is highly dependent on the surrounding pH and is a key determinant of a protein's structure and function. This practice problem [@problem_id:2343918] challenges you to calculate the net charge of a dipeptide at a specific pH, reinforcing your ability to apply $pK_a$ values to predict the ionization state of its various functional groups.", "problem": "A dipeptide is formed from the amino acids aspartic acid (Asp) and lysine (Lys), with aspartic acid serving as the N-terminal residue and lysine as the C-terminal residue.

The peptide bond connects the Asp side of the peptide to the Lys side, leaving four ionizable groups: the N-terminal alpha-amino group on Asp ($pK_a$ given as $9.8$), the side-chain carboxyl group on Asp ($pK_a$ given as $3.9$), the C-terminal alpha-carboxyl group on Lys ($pK_a$ given as $2.2$), and the Lys side-chain amino group ($pK_a$ given as $10.5$).

The structure is:\n$\\text{H}_2\\text{N-CH}_2\\text{-CO-NH-CH(CH}_3\\text{)-CO-NH-CH(CH(CH}_3)_2\\text{)-COOH}$\nThis tripeptide has two peptide bonds: one between Glycine (Gly) and Alanine (Ala), and another between Alanine (Ala) and Valine (Val). Complete hydrolysis means both of these bonds will be broken.\n\nThe general reaction for peptide bond hydrolysis is the addition of a water molecule across the amide bond to yield a carboxylic acid and an amine:\n$\\text{R}_1\\text{-CO-NH-R}_2 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{R}_1\\text{-COOH} + \\text{H}_2\\text{N-R}_2$\n\nThe mechanism for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis is a nucleophilic acyl substitution.\n1.  The carbonyl oxygen of the peptide bond is protonated by the acid catalyst, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic.\n2.  A water molecule from the solvent (in this case, $\\text{H}_2^{18}\\text{O}$) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon.\n3.  This forms a tetrahedral intermediate. The oxygen atom from the attacking water molecule is now part of this intermediate.\n4.  After a proton transfer, the C-N bond is cleaved, and the amine portion of the bond departs as a leaving group (after being protonated).\n5.  The tetrahedral intermediate collapses, reforming the C=O double bond and yielding a carboxylic acid. Crucially, one of the oxygen atoms in this newly formed carboxyl group comes from the nucleophilic water molecule.\n\nLet's apply this mechanism to the hydrolysis of Gly-Ala-Val.\n\nStep 1: Hydrolysis of the peptide bond between Alanine and Valine.\nThe peptide bond is between the carbonyl group of Alanine and the amino group of Valine. A molecule of $\\text{H}_2^{18}\\text{O}$ will attack the carbonyl carbon of the alanine residue.\n$\\text{Ala-CO-NH-Val} + \\text{H}_2{^{18}}\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{Ala-CO}^{18}\\text{OH} + \\text{H}_2\\text{N-Val}$\nFollowing the mechanism, the $^{18}\\text{O}$ atom from the water molecule is incorporated into the newly formed carboxyl group of Alanine. This hydrolysis event liberates the free amino acid Valine.\n\nStep 2: Hydrolysis of the peptide bond between Glycine and Alanine.\nThe peptide bond is between the carbonyl group of Glycine and the amino group of Alanine. A second molecule of $\\text{H}_2^{18}\\text{O}$ will attack the carbonyl carbon of the glycine residue.\n$\\text{Gly-CO-NH-Ala} + \\text{H}_2{^{18}}\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{Gly-CO}^{18}\\text{OH} + \\text{H}_2\\text{N-Ala}$\nSimilarly, the $^{18}\\text{O}$ atom from this water molecule is incorporated into the newly formed carboxyl group of Glycine. This hydrolysis event liberates the free amino acid Alanine (which now has both a free amino group and a newly labeled carboxyl group).\n\nStep 3: Analyze the final products.\nThe final products of the complete hydrolysis are three free amino acids: Glycine, Alanine, and Valine.\n-   **Glycine**: Its carboxyl group was formed by the hydrolysis of the Gly-Ala peptide bond. Therefore, it incorporates one $^{18}\\text{O}$ atom.\n-   **Alanine**: Its carboxyl group was formed by the hydrolysis of the Ala-Val peptide bond. Therefore, it also incorporates one $^{18}\\text{O}$ atom.\n-   **Valine**: This is the C-terminal amino acid. Its carboxyl group was already present in the original tripeptide; it was not formed by a hydrolysis event. The problem explicitly states to ignore any subsequent isotopic exchange between existing carboxyl groups and the solvent. Therefore, the carboxyl group of Valine remains unlabeled with $^{16}\\text{O}$ atoms.\n\nSummary of labeling:\n-   Glycine: Labeled with one $^{18}\\text{O}$ atom in its carboxyl group.\n-   Alanine: Labeled with one $^{18}\\text{O}$ atom in its carboxyl group.\n-   Valine: Unlabeled.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nLet's review the other options:\n-   A is incorrect because the C-terminal valine's carboxyl group is not formed by hydrolysis.\n-   C is incorrect because the Gly-Ala bond is hydrolyzed, labeling glycine, not valine.\n-   D is incorrect because valine is not labeled, and no double labeling occurs from a single hydrolysis event.\n-   E is incorrect because the oxygen from water attacks the carbonyl carbon, not the amine nitrogen. The nitrogen atoms are not labeled.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2343898"}]}
