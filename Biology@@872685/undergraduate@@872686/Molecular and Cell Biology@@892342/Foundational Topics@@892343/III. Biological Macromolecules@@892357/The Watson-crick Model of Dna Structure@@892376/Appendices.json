A hybrid double helix composed of one DNA strand and one RNA strand.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the structure and composition of a viral nucleic acid based on its base composition. We will analyze the provided molar percentages by comparing them to the known structural rules of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) and Ribonucleic Acid (RNA).\n\nThe provided base composition is:\n- %A = 24.0%\n- %G = 18.0%\n- %C = 26.0%\n- %T = 0.0%\n- %U = 32.0%\n\nFirst, we determine whether the nucleic acid is DNA or RNA. The key distinction is the presence of either Thymine (T) or Uracil (U). DNA molecules contain Thymine, while RNA molecules contain Uracil. The analysis shows that the molar percentage of Thymine is 0.0%, while the molar percentage of Uracil is 32.0%. The presence of U and the complete absence of T is the definitive characteristic of RNA. Therefore, the viral genome is composed of RNA. This immediately allows us to eliminate all options involving DNA.\n\n- Option A (double-stranded DNA) is incorrect.\n- Option C (single-stranded DNA) is incorrect.\n- Option E (mixture of dsDNA) is incorrect.\n- Option F (DNA-RNA hybrid) is also incorrect, as the DNA strand in such a hybrid would contain Thymine, which is absent from the sample.\n\nNow we are left with the possibilities that the genome is either double-stranded RNA (Option B) or single-stranded RNA (Option D).\n\nTo distinguish between double-stranded and single-stranded structures, we apply Chargaff's rules, which are a consequence of the base-pairing in a Watson-Crick double helix. For a double-stranded molecule, Adenine (A) pairs with the complementary base, and Guanine (G) pairs with its complementary base.\n- In dsDNA, A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. Thus, %A = %T and %G = %C.\n- In dsRNA, A pairs with U, and G pairs with C. Thus, %A = %U and %G = %C.\n\nLet's test the data against the rules for dsRNA:\n1.  Check the A-U pairing: The mole percent of Adenine is %A = 24.0%, and the mole percent of Uracil is %U = 32.0%. Since 24.0% is not equal to 32.0%, the condition %A = %U is not met.\n2.  Check the G-C pairing: The mole percent of Guanine is %G = 18.0%, and the mole percent of Cytosine is %C = 26.0%. Since 18.0% is not equal to 26.0%, the condition %G = %C is not met.\n\nSince the molar percentages of the complementary bases are not equal, the nucleic acid does not form a complete, base-paired double helix. Therefore, the viral genome must be single-stranded.\n\nCombining our conclusions:\n1. The nucleic acid is RNA (due to the presence of U and absence of T).\n2. The nucleic acid is single-stranded (due to the violation of Chargaff's rules for a double helix).\n\nThus, the viral genome consists of a single-stranded RNA molecule. This corresponds to Option D.\n\nFinal check of all options:\n- A. Double-stranded DNA: Incorrect. It is RNA, and the pairing rules are violated.\n- B. Double-stranded RNA: Incorrect. The pairing rules (%A=%U, %G=%C) are violated.\n- C. Single-stranded DNA: Incorrect. It is RNA, not DNA.\n- D. Single-stranded RNA: Correct. It is RNA, and the lack of stoichiometric base pairing indicates a single-stranded structure.\n- E. Mixture of dsDNA: Incorrect. The sample is RNA.\n- F. Hybrid DNA-RNA double helix: Incorrect. The absence of T rules this out.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2085759"}, {"introduction": "The structure of DNA elegantly explains its function, particularly its ability to be replicated faithfully. The rules of the Watson-Crick model are not merely descriptive; they are the instructions for synthesizing a new strand of DNA. This practice puts you in the role of a DNA polymerase enzyme, challenging you to construct a new DNA strand by applying the core principles of base complementarity and antiparallel orientation.

Adenine (A) always pairs with Thymine (T), and Guanine (G) always pairs with Cytosine (C). We can use this rule to determine the sequence of bases in the new strand.\n\nThe template strand is given as:\n5'- A T G C G T -3'\n\nApplying the pairing rules to each base in the template:\n- The base complementary to A is T.\n- The base complementary to T is A.\n- The base complementary to G is C.\n- The base complementary to C is G.\n- The base complementary to G is C.\n- The base complementary to T is A.\n\nSo, the sequence of complementary bases is T-A-C-G-C-A.\n\nStep 2: Understand the Antiparallel Orientation.\nDNA strands are antiparallel, meaning they run in opposite directions. If one strand is oriented in the 5' to 3' direction, its complementary strand must be oriented in the 3' to 5' direction relative to it.\n\nThe template strand is given in the 5' to 3' direction:\nTemplate: 5'- A T G C G T -3'\n\nTherefore, the new strand, as it pairs with the template, will have a 3' to 5' orientation:\nTemplate:   5'- A T G C G T -3'\nComplement: 3'- T A C G C A -5'\n\nStep 3: Convention for Writing DNA Sequences.\nBy scientific convention, single-stranded DNA sequences are written in the 5' to 3' direction unless specified otherwise. DNA polymerase also synthesizes new DNA in the 5' to 3' direction. The question asks for the sequence and orientation of the *newly synthesized strand*. To express our result from Step 2 in the standard 5' to 3' notation, we must read the sequence 3'-TACGCA-5' from right to left (from its 5' end to its 3' end).\n\nReading 3'-TACGCA-5' from the 5' end gives:\n5'- A C G C A T -3'\n\nStep 4: Compare with the Options.\nWe now compare our derived sequence and orientation with the given choices:\nA. 5'-TACGCA-3': This sequence is complementary but runs parallel to the template, which is incorrect. This mistake arises from forgetting the antiparallel nature of DNA.\nB. 3'-ACGCAT-5': This has the correct sequence of bases but is written in the 3' to 5' direction. While technically representing the same molecule as the correct answer, it's not the conventional way to write the final product. More importantly, reading this from the 5' end (right to left) would give 5'-TACGCA-3', which is the incorrect sequence found in option A.\nC. 5'-ATGCGT-3': This is identical to the template strand, not the complementary strand.\nD. 5'-ACGCAT-3': This sequence is both complementary and antiparallel to the template, and it is written in the standard 5' to 3' direction.
