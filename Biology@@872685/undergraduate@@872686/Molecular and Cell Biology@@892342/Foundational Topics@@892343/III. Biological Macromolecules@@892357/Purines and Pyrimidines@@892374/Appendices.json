This fundamental principle, known as complementary base pairing, dictates a strict stoichiometry within any double-stranded DNA molecule. This practice exercise challenges you to apply these rules, first articulated by Erwin Chargaff, to deduce the complete base composition of a DNA sample from a single piece of information, a foundational skill for any molecular biologist.

The genome is found to consist of a single, linear molecule of double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Through base composition analysis, it is determined that cytosine bases account for 22.0% of the total nitrogenous bases in the molecule. Assuming standard Watson-Crick base pairing governs the structure of this DNA, calculate the expected proportion of adenine bases.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the fractions of the four bases in the double-stranded DNA be denoted by $p_{A}$, $p_{T}$, $p_{G}$, and $p_{C}$. Standard Watson-Crick pairing implies Chargaff’s rules: $p_{A} = p_{T}$ and $p_{G} = p_{C}$. The fractions must sum to unity:\n$$\np_{A} + p_{T} + p_{G} + p_{C} = 1.\n$$\nGiven $p_{C} = 0.220$, we have $p_{G} = p_{C} = 0.220$. Therefore\n$$\np_{A} + p_{T} = 1 - (p_{G} + p_{C}) = 1 - 2p_{C}.\n$$\nUsing $p_{A} = p_{T}$ gives\n$$\n2p_{A} = 1 - 2p_{C} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad p_{A} = \\frac{1 - 2p_{C}}{2}.\n$$\nSubstituting $p_{C} = 0.220$,\n$$\np_{A} = \\frac{1 - 0.440}{2} = \\frac{0.560}{2} = 0.280.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, the expected proportion of adenine is $0.280$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.280}$$", "id": "1516170"}, {"introduction": "Beyond understanding their final structure in DNA, it is crucial to know how purine and pyrimidine bases are constructed by the cell.

The bacteria are cultured in a minimal medium where the sole source of nitrogen for pyrimidine synthesis is provided as glutamine, and the sole source of single carbons for the pyrimidine ring is bicarbonate. The medium is specifically supplemented with two isotopically labeled compounds: bicarbonate in which the carbon atom is a heavy isotope, $^{13}\\text{C}$, and glutamine in which the amide nitrogen atom is a heavy isotope, $^{15}\\text{N}$. After sufficient time for growth and replication, the newly synthesized Uridine Monophosphate (UMP) is extracted.\n\nThe pyrimidine ring, the core of UMP, is a six-membered heterocycle. The standard atom numbering for this ring follows the sequence N1-C2-N3-C4-C5-C6, which forms a closed loop between atom C6 and atom N1. The nitrogen atoms are at positions 1 and 3.\n\nBased on the known biochemical pathway for de novo pyrimidine synthesis, predict the specific locations of the $^{13}\\text{C}$ and $^{15}\\text{N}$ isotopes within the pyrimidine ring of the newly formed UMP.\n\nA.

Carbamoyl phosphate is synthesized by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase from bicarbonate (source of the carbonyl carbon), glutamine amide nitrogen (source of the amide nitrogen), and phosphate. Aspartate transcarbamoylase then condenses carbamoyl phosphate with aspartate to form carbamoyl aspartate, which cyclizes to dihydroorotate and is oxidized to orotate; subsequent addition of PRPP and decarboxylation yields UMP. During OMP decarboxylation, the carboxyl group derived from aspartate at the orotate C6 position is lost as carbon dioxide, but the ring atoms remain.\n\nThe atom-origin mapping for the pyrimidine ring is as follows, based on standard biochemistry:\n- The carbonyl carbon of carbamoyl phosphate, which originates from bicarbonate, becomes ring carbon $C2$.\n- The amide nitrogen of carbamoyl phosphate, which originates from the glutamine amide nitrogen, becomes ring nitrogen $N3$.\n- The remaining ring atoms $N1$, $C4$, $C5$, and $C6$ derive from aspartate.\n\nGiven the labeling in the medium:\n- Bicarbonate carries $^{13}\\text{C}$, so the labeled carbon will appear at $C2$.\n- Glutamine’s amide nitrogen carries $^{15}\\text{N}$, so the labeled nitrogen will appear at $N3$.\n\nTherefore, the correct assignment is $^{13}\\text{C}$ at $C2$ and $^{15}\\text{N}$ at $N3$, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2333953"}, {"introduction": "The precise structure of each purine and pyrimidine is critical for the faithful replication of genetic information. When molecules that mimic these bases, known as base analogs, are introduced into the cell, they can be mistakenly incorporated into DNA and cause pairing errors.

This bacterium is subjected to a two-stage experiment.\n\nIn the first stage, the bacterium is cultured for exactly one generation in a medium containing a mutagenic agent, 5-bromouracil (5-BU). The agent 5-BU is a base analog of thymine (T), and in its most common stable form (keto form), it pairs with adenine (A) during DNA replication.\n\nIn the second stage, the two cells resulting from the first division are immediately transferred to a new medium that is completely free of 5-BU. They are then allowed to grow for exactly one more generation. It is known that if a 5-BU base has been incorporated into a DNA strand, it has a significant probability of temporarily shifting to its rare, unstable tautomeric form (enol form) when it serves as a template in the next replication round. In this enol form, 5-BU preferentially pairs with guanine (G).\n\nAssuming that the 5-BU is incorporated into a new DNA strand during the first replication round and the subsequent mispairing event occurs during the second replication round, what will be the composition of the base pairs at this specific locus across the four granddaughter DNA molecules?\n\nA.

This produces one daughter duplex containing an A-5BU pair.\n- The complementary parental strand with template T directs incorporation of A, producing the other daughter duplex containing a normal A-T pair.\nThus, after the first generation, there are two duplexes: one with A-5BU and one with A-T.\n3) Second replication (in 5-BU-free medium), allowing mispairing from the incorporated 5-BU:\n- Replication of the A-5BU duplex yields two granddaughter duplexes:\n  a) The parental A strand templates a new T, yielding a granddaughter duplex with an A-T pair.\n  b) The parental strand containing 5-BU now serves as a template; by the stated assumption, it undergoes the tautomeric shift to the enol form during templating and pairs with G. This yields a granddaughter duplex with a G-5BU pair at the locus.\n- Replication of the A-T duplex yields two granddaughter duplexes, both with normal A-T pairs, since there is no 5-BU present and no mispairing is specified.\n\nTally across the four granddaughter DNA molecules: three duplexes with A-T pairs and one duplex with a G-5BU pair.
