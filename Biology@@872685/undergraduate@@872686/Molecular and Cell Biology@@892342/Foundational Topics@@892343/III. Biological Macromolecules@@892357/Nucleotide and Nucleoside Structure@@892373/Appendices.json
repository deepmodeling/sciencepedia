This thought experiment challenges you to consider why nature exclusively uses the D-enantiomer of sugars in nucleic acids [@problem_id:2327028]. By predicting the structure of a hypothetical DNA made from L-sugars, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how molecular chirality dictates macroscopic biological structure.", "problem": "In terrestrial life, the backbone of nucleic acids such as Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) and Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) is constructed from nucleotides containing a pentose sugar in its D-enantiomeric form (specifically D-2'-deoxyribose for DNA and D-ribose for RNA). These D-nucleotides polymerize to form the familiar right-handed double helix of B-form DNA under physiological conditions.\n\nImagine a hypothetical scenario where life evolved using L-sugars instead. A researcher synthesizes a DNA-like polymer exclusively from nucleotides containing L-2'-deoxyribose, while keeping the nitrogenous bases (A, T, C, G) and the phosphodiester linkages the same. Assuming this polymer anneals with its complementary strand to form a stable double helix, which of the following statements most accurately describes the resulting helical structure?\n\nA. It would form a left-handed double helix, which is the mirror image of the canonical right-handed B-form helix.\n\nB. It would spontaneously form a Z-DNA like structure, characterized by a zig-zag backbone and purines in the *syn* conformation.\n\nC. It would be unable to form a stable double helix because the steric clashes introduced by the L-sugar would prevent proper base pairing.\n\nD. It would form a right-handed double helix, but with its major and minor grooves having approximately equal widths.\n\nE. It would form a stable double helix where both strands run in the same direction, known as a parallel double helix.", "solution": "We proceed by analyzing how inverting the sugar chirality affects the geometry and symmetry of a DNA duplex while keeping base identity and phosphodiester connectivity unchanged.\n\nFirst, the chirality of the pentose sugar determines the overall three-dimensional configuration of the nucleic acid backbone, because the sugar’s stereocenters define the allowed ranges and signs of the backbone torsion angles and the sugar puckering modes. In standard DNA, the backbone built from D-2'-deoxyribose adopts B-form geometry under physiological conditions, yielding a right-handed double helix when two complementary antiparallel strands anneal.\n\nSecond, if every sugar is replaced by its enantiomer (L-2'-deoxyribose), the entire polymer’s local chiral environment is inverted. An enantiomeric substitution of all chiral centers produces the mirror image of the original three-dimensional structure when all other components (bases and linkages) remain unchanged. This is a direct consequence of enantiomeric symmetry: the structure composed of the enantiomeric monomers is the mirror image of the structure composed of the original monomers, provided the same nonchiral constraints (Watson–Crick base pairing and phosphodiester connectivity) apply.\n\nThird, base pairing is governed by complementary hydrogen-bonding patterns of the nitrogenous bases and does not require the absolute configuration of the sugar to be D; L-nucleotides form Watson–Crick pairs with L-complements. Therefore, replacing D-sugars with L-sugars does not preclude stable duplex formation, as long as both strands have the same sugar chirality and are complementary; the strands still adopt antiparallel orientation to optimize phosphate–phosphate spacing and base stacking, as in the canonical case.\n\nFourth, because the duplex of L-nucleotides is the mirror image of the D-based duplex, the handedness of the helix is inverted: the mirror image of a right-handed helix is a left-handed helix. Thus, an L-DNA duplex that is the B-form mirror will be left-handed. At the same time, the relative widths of the major and minor grooves are preserved under mirroring (they are swapped left-right in a mirror but not equalized), so the assertion that the grooves become approximately equal in width is incorrect. Furthermore, the formation of Z-DNA requires specific sequence and conformational features (alternating purine–pyrimidine, syn glycosidic conformations for purines, and zig-zag backbone), not merely inversion of sugar chirality; thus L-sugar alone does not impose Z-DNA geometry. Finally, parallel strand orientation is not induced by sugar enantiomerization; antiparallel polarity is retained for optimal hydrogen bonding and stacking.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that an L-2'-deoxyribose DNA duplex forms the left-handed mirror image of the canonical right-handed B-form duplex.\n\nThis analysis rules out the other options: it does not force Z-DNA (reject B), it can form a stable duplex (reject C), it is not right-handed with equal grooves (reject D), and it is not parallel (reject E). The accurate statement is that it forms a left-handed mirror-image B-form helix (option A).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2327028"}]}
