This thought experiment challenges you to trace the intricate signaling cascade that activates cholesterol synthesis genes. By considering a specific mutation that blocks a key proteolytic step, you can deduce the consequences for gene expression and appreciate the elegant logic of this feedback system. [@problem_id:2338885]", "problem": "Cellular cholesterol homeostasis is tightly regulated by a feedback mechanism involving the Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein (SREBP) family of transcription factors. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), SREBP is complexed with SREBP Cleavage-Activating Protein (SCAP). When cellular sterol levels are low, the SREBP-SCAP complex is transported to the Golgi apparatus. In the Golgi, SREBP undergoes sequential proteolytic cleavage. First, Site-1 Protease (S1P) cleaves SREBP within its luminal loop. This cleavage allows a second enzyme, Site-2 Protease (S2P), to cleave SREBP within its first transmembrane domain. This second cleavage releases the N-terminal domain of SREBP (nSREBP), which then translocates to the nucleus. In the nucleus, nSREBP binds to sterol regulatory elements in the promoter regions of target genes, activating their transcription. A key target gene is HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. When sterol levels are high, sterols bind to SCAP, inducing a conformational change that causes the SREBP-SCAP complex to be retained in the ER, preventing SREBP activation and thus downregulating cholesterol synthesis.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered human cell line that expresses a mutant form of SREBP-2. This mutant protein is identical to the wild-type SREBP-2, except that the specific amino acid sequence recognized and cleaved by S1P has been deleted. These cells are cultured in a medium completely depleted of sterols.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes best describes the expected expression level of the HMG-CoA reductase gene in these mutant cells under these specific conditions?\n\nA. The expression will be highly upregulated compared to wild-type cells grown in high-sterol media.\n\nB. The expression will be maintained at a low, basal level, similar to that of wild-type cells grown in high-sterol media.\n\nC. The expression will be completely silenced, with zero transcripts produced.\n\nD. The expression will be constitutively active at the maximum possible level, regardless of the SREBP-2 mutation.\n\nE. The expression will be moderately upregulated, but to a lesser extent than in wild-type cells grown in sterol-depleted media.", "solution": "The regulatory mechanism for SREBP activation requires two sequential proteolytic cleavages in the Golgi. Under low sterol conditions, SCAP escorts SREBP from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. Site-1 protease (S1P) first cleaves SREBP within the luminal loop; this initial cleavage is necessary to expose the Site-2 protease (S2P) cleavage site in the first transmembrane domain. S2P then performs intramembrane cleavage to release the N-terminal transcription factor (nSREBP), which translocates to the nucleus and activates target genes, including HMG-CoA reductase.\n\nIn the engineered mutant, the amino acid sequence recognized by S1P is deleted. Therefore:\n- S1P cannot cleave SREBP at its luminal site.\n- Without S1P cleavage, S2P cannot access or cleave its site, so nSREBP cannot be released.\n- Consequently, even though low sterol conditions promote SCAP-dependent trafficking to the Golgi, no active nSREBP is generated.\n\nWithout nSREBP, there is no SREBP-mediated transcriptional activation of the HMG-CoA reductase gene. However, complete loss of transcription is not expected because basal promoter activity and other transcription factors can sustain low-level expression. This expression level corresponds to the low, basal state observed in wild-type cells under high-sterol conditions, where SREBP activation is similarly prevented due to ER retention.\n\nTherefore, the expected outcome is that HMG-CoA reductase expression remains at a low, basal level, comparable to wild-type cells in high-sterol media, and not zero, not moderately or highly upregulated, and not constitutively maximal.\n\nThus, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2338885"}, {"introduction": "Beyond synthesizing its own cholesterol, a cell must also import it from the bloodstream through receptor-mediated endocytosis, a process that can fail in genetic diseases like familial hypercholesterolemia. This practice focuses on the LDL receptor and asks you to distinguish between its two primary functions: binding LDL particles and initiating their internalization. Analyzing the effect of a specific mutation that uncouples these two steps will deepen your understanding of how protein structure dictates cellular function. [@problem_id:2338898]", "problem": "Cholesterol is transported in the bloodstream primarily within Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) particles. Cells regulate their internal cholesterol levels by taking up LDL from the blood via receptor-mediated endocytosis, a process initiated by the LDL Receptor (LDLR). The LDLR is a transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain that binds LDL and a cytoplasmic tail essential for internalization. This internalization occurs through clathrin-coated pits. For the LDLR to be incorporated into a forming pit, its cytoplasmic tail must bind to the Adaptor Protein 2 (AP-2) complex, which acts as a bridge to the clathrin protein lattice.\n\nA research team is studying a specific inherited form of familial hypercholesterolemia. They have isolated fibroblasts from a patient and identified a point mutation in the LDLR gene. This mutation results in a single amino acid substitution within the short amino acid sequence in the receptor's cytoplasmic tail responsible for binding to AP-2. Further biochemical assays confirm that while the mutant LDLR protein is correctly synthesized, folded, and transported to the plasma membrane, its ability to interact with the AP-2 complex is completely abolished.\n\nTo characterize the functional consequence of this mutation, the researchers conduct an experiment. They culture two cell populations: one of normal (wild-type) fibroblasts and one of the patient's mutant fibroblasts. Both cultures are incubated in a medium containing a fixed concentration of fluorescently-labeled LDL particles. The experiment is designed to independently assess the ability of the cells to bind LDL to their surface and their ability to internalize the bound LDL. Based on the molecular defect described, which of the following outcomes is the most likely observation when comparing the mutant cells to the wild-type cells?\n\nA. The mutant cells will exhibit a capacity for LDL binding to the cell surface that is comparable to wild-type cells, but they will show a severe reduction in the rate of LDL internalization.\n\nB. The mutant cells will exhibit a significantly reduced capacity to bind LDL to the cell surface, leading to a correspondingly low rate of LDL internalization.\n\nC. The mutant cells will be completely unable to bind LDL particles, and therefore, no LDL internalization will be observed.\n\nD. The mutant cells will bind LDL normally but will internalize LDL at a significantly accelerated rate compared to wild-type cells due to compensatory mechanisms.\n\nE. Both LDL binding and LDL internalization in the mutant cells will be indistinguishable from those in the wild-type cells, indicating the mutation has no functional effect on the uptake pathway.\n\nF. The mutant cells will bind and internalize LDL normally, but the LDL particles will become trapped within late endosomes and fail to release their cholesterol content.", "solution": "The biological mechanism of LDL uptake proceeds via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The LDL receptor (LDLR) has two separable functional regions: an extracellular domain that binds LDL and a cytoplasmic tail that contains a specific internalization signal required for recruitment into clathrin-coated pits. Incorporation into clathrin-coated pits requires binding of the LDLR cytoplasmic tail to the AP-2 adaptor complex, which links cargo to the clathrin lattice.\n\nGiven the mutation described, the following constraints are established by the experimental findings:\n1. The mutant LDLR is correctly synthesized, properly folded, and trafficked to the plasma membrane. Therefore, its surface expression level is not impaired.\n2. The mutation is confined to the short sequence in the cytoplasmic tail that mediates AP-2 binding, and biochemical assays show AP-2 interaction is abolished.\n3. The extracellular LDL-binding domain is intact; thus, ligand binding per receptor remains normal.\n\nFrom these constraints, two functional steps must be considered separately:\n- Surface binding: Because the receptor is present on the plasma membrane and its LDL-binding ectodomain is intact, the capacity to bind fluorescent LDL on the cell surface should be comparable to wild-type cells, assuming similar receptor density at the surface.\n- Internalization: Without AP-2 binding, the receptor cannot be efficiently recruited into clathrin-coated pits. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis of LDLR–LDL complexes will be severely reduced. Therefore, the rate of LDL internalization will be markedly decreased relative to wild-type.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A matches the predicted dissociation between normal binding and defective internalization due to loss of AP-2 interaction.\n- B and C incorrectly predict reduced or absent binding, which would require defects in the extracellular domain or absence from the surface.\n- D contradicts the loss of AP-2 interaction by proposing accelerated internalization.\n- E contradicts the confirmed loss of AP-2 binding, which is essential for internalization.\n- F proposes a defect downstream in endosomal trafficking, not supported by the AP-2 binding defect at the internalization step.\n\nTherefore, the most likely observation is normal surface binding with severely reduced internalization, corresponding to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2338898"}]}
