This process is primarily mediated by two enzymes. First, glycogen phosphorylase sequentially cleaves glucose units from the non-reducing ends of the glycogen molecule via phosphorolysis of $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ glycosidic bonds. However, this enzyme's activity ceases when it approaches to within four glucose residues of an $\\alpha(1\\to6)$ branch point. At this stage, a bifunctional enzyme called the glycogen debranching enzyme intervenes. This enzyme possesses two distinct catalytic activities:\n\n1.  A **4-$\\alpha$-glucanotransferase** activity, which acts as a transferase. It transfers a block of three glucose residues from the four-residue branch to the non-reducing end of another, longer chain.\n2.  An **$\\alpha(1\\to6)$-glucosidase** activity, which hydrolyzes the single remaining glucose residue attached at the $\\alpha(1\\to6)$ branch point, releasing it as free glucose.\n\nNow, consider a hypothetical scenario involving a rare genetic disorder affecting a patient's liver cells. In these cells, the gene for the glycogen debranching enzyme has mutated such that the enzyme completely loses its 4-$\\alpha$-glucanotransferase (transferase) activity, while its $\\alpha(1\\to6)$-glucosidase activity remains fully intact and functional.\n\nAssuming glycogenolysis is initiated in these affected liver cells, which of the following statements best describes the structural characteristic of the glycogen molecules that would predominantly accumulate?\n\nA. Normal glycogen structure, as other enzymes would compensate for the defect.\n\nB. Glycogen is completely degraded into free glucose, as the retained glucosidase activity becomes hyperactive.\n\nC. Accumulation of molecules where the outer branches have been uniformly shortened to four glucose residues from each $\\alpha(1\\to6)$ branch point.\n\nD. Glycogen molecules with abnormally short outer branches, each consisting of only a single glucose residue attached at the $\\alpha(1\\to6)$ branch points.\n\nE. Formation of long, linear, unbranched polysaccharide chains.", "solution": "Glycogen phosphorylase removes glucose units as glucose-1-phosphate by cleaving $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ linkages from nonreducing ends, but it halts when it is within four residues of an $\\alpha(1\\to6)$ branch point. This produces a phosphorylase limit structure in which each outer branch remains as a four-residue stub proximal to the $\\alpha(1\\to6)$ junction.\n\nNormally, the glycogen debranching enzyme resolves this limit structure in two steps:\n1) Its $4-\\alpha$-glucanotransferase activity transfers a block of three glucose residues from the four-residue stub to another chain, leaving a single glucose residue at the $\\alpha(1\\to6)$ branch point.\n2) Its $\\alpha(1\\to6)$-glucosidase activity then hydrolyzes that single, now-exposed $\\alpha(1\\to6)$-linked glucose, releasing free glucose.\n\nIn the hypothetical defect, the $4-\\alpha$-glucanotransferase activity is absent, while the $\\alpha(1\\to6)$-glucosidase remains intact. Without the transferase step, the three distal $\\alpha(1\\to4)$-linked residues on each branch cannot be removed, so the single $\\alpha(1\\to6)$-linked residue is never exposed as a lone branch-point glucose. Consequently, the intact $\\alpha(1\\to6)$-glucosidase cannot act. Therefore, glycogen phosphorylase will proceed until its normal limit and stop, yielding accumulation of phosphorylase limit dextrin: branches uniformly shortened to four residues from each $\\alpha(1\\to6)$ branch point.\n\nEliminating the options:\n- A is false because no other enzyme compensates for the missing transferase.\n- B is false because the glucosidase cannot access the branch point without prior transferase action.\n- D is false because a single branch-point glucose requires the transferase step to precede glucosidase.\n- E describes branching enzyme deficiency (long unbranched chains), not debranching transferase loss.\n\nThe best description is uniform four-residue outer branches at each $\\alpha(1\\to6)$ branch point.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2339131"}, {"introduction": "Metabolic pathways are often defined by their energetic efficiency. This final practice challenges you to quantify why cells use phosphorolysis, rather than simple hydrolysis, to mobilize glucose from storage polymers. By calculating the net energy difference between breaking down a linear polymer versus a hypothetical branched one with a costly hydrolysis step, you will connect molecular structure and enzymatic mechanism directly to the bioenergetic balance sheet of the cell [@problem_id:2339172].", "problem": "In a study of extremophile metabolism, a novel bacterium is discovered that stores glucose in two distinct polysaccharide forms. The first is a simple linear polymer, Amyloform, consisting of glucose residues linked by $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ glycosidic bonds. The second is a highly branched polymer, Glycoform, which has a distinct structural organization and a unique catabolic pathway. A Glycoform molecule is constructed such that, on average, for every 9 glucose residues linked in a linear $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ chain, a 10th residue is added as an $\\alpha(1\\to6)$ branch point, defining a branching frequency.\n\nThe cell mobilizes these polymers to feed glucose units into its glycolytic pathway. The universal entry point for glycolysis is Glucose-6-Phosphate (G6P). The metabolic pathways for mobilization are as follows:\n\n1.  **Amyloform Mobilization**: This occurs via a standard phosphorylase enzyme, which cleaves $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ bonds using inorganic phosphate to yield Glucose-1-Phosphate (G1P).\n2.  **Glycoform Mobilization**: This process is more complex due to the branches and a peculiarity in its enzymatic machinery.\n    - A phosphorylase acts on the accessible $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ linkages, producing G1P.\n    - The cell lacks a standard debranching enzyme. Instead, it utilizes a specialized enzyme, 'branch-hydrolase', to cleave the $\\alpha(1\\to6)$ bond at each branch point. This hydrolysis releases a molecule of free glucose but requires the coupled hydrolysis of one molecule of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP).\n    - Any free glucose released into the cytoplasm must be phosphorylated to G6P by a hexokinase-like enzyme, a process that consumes one molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n3.  **Shared Steps**: For both pathways, all G1P produced is converted to G6P by a phosphoglucomutase at no net energy cost. For all bioenergetic accounting purposes, the hydrolysis of one molecule of GTP is considered energetically equivalent to the hydrolysis of one molecule of ATP.\n\nConsider two separate storage depots in the bacterium. One depot contains a single large Amyloform molecule and the other contains a single large Glycoform molecule, with each polymer being composed of exactly 12,500 glucose residues. Calculate the difference in the net number of ATP-equivalent molecules consumed to convert all 12,500 glucose residues from the Glycoform molecule into G6P, compared to converting all 12,500 residues from the Amyloform molecule into G6P.", "solution": "Let the total number of glucose residues be $N=12500$.\n\nFor Amyloform (linear $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ polymer), a phosphorylase cleaves $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ bonds by phosphorolysis to yield G1P, and phosphoglucomutase converts G1P to G6P at no net energy cost. Thus the net ATP-equivalent consumption for converting all residues to G6P is\n$$A_{\\text{Amylo}}=0.$$\n\nFor Glycoform, the branching frequency is defined such that for every 9 residues linked in $\\alpha(1\\to4)$, a 10th residue is added as an $\\alpha(1\\to6)$ branch point. Interpreting this as one $\\alpha(1\\to6)$ linkage per 10 residues, the number of branch points (and hence the number of residues released as free glucose upon debranching) is\n$$B=\\frac{N}{10}=\\frac{12500}{10}=1250.$$\nAt each branch point, the branch-hydrolase cleaves the $\\alpha(1\\to6)$ bond, releasing one free glucose at the cost of hydrolyzing one GTP. The free glucose is then phosphorylated to G6P by a hexokinase-like enzyme at the cost of one ATP. Counting GTP hydrolysis as energetically equivalent to ATP hydrolysis, the ATP-equivalents consumed per branch point are\n$$1\\ \\text{GTP} + 1\\ \\text{ATP} = 2\\ \\text{ATP-equivalents}.$$\nTherefore, the total ATP-equivalents consumed for Glycoform are\n$$A_{\\text{Glyco}}=2B=2 \\times 1250=2500.$$\nAll other residues, numbering $N-B=12500-1250=11250$, are released as G1P by phosphorylase and converted to G6P at no net energy cost.\n\nHence, the difference in ATP-equivalents consumed to convert all residues from Glycoform into G6P compared to Amyloform is\n$$\\Delta A = A_{\\text{Glyco}} - A_{\\text{Amylo}} = 2500 - 0 = 2500.$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2500}$$", "id": "2339172"}]}
