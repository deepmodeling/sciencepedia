The cell membrane, which separates the internal aqueous cytosol from the external aqueous medium, is a phospholipid bilayer. These phospholipid molecules are amphipathic: they possess a polar, hydrophilic \"head\" group (containing phosphate) and two nonpolar, hydrophobic \"tail\" groups (composed of hydrocarbon chains). In water, they spontaneously assemble into a bilayer where the hydrophobic tails are shielded from the water, forming a nonpolar core, while the hydrophilic heads face the aqueous environments on both the inside and outside of the cell.\n\nNow, consider a hypothetical single-celled organism, an \"oleophile,\" that has evolved to thrive in an environment consisting entirely of a nonpolar solvent, such as liquid hexane. However, this organism's internal biochemistry is still water-based, meaning its cytosol is an aqueous solution. To survive, the oleophile must maintain a stable membrane that effectively separates its internal polar environment from the external nonpolar environment.\n\nWhich of the following statements most plausibly describes the structure and composition of this organism's cell membrane?\n\nA.

A bilayer composed of novel \"anti-amphipathic\" lipids that have nonpolar heads and polar tails, arranged to form a stable barrier.\n\nE. A thick membrane composed of purely nonpolar lipids to form a strong barrier against the internal aqueous environment.", "solution": "The fundamental principle governing the formation of a stable biological membrane is the minimization of thermodynamically unfavorable interactions. This principle is often summarized as \"like dissolves like,\" meaning polar groups preferentially interact with other polar groups, and nonpolar groups with other nonpolar groups. The boundary between a polar and a nonpolar environment is energetically costly. A stable membrane must arrange its constituent molecules to create favorable interactions at both its inner and outer surfaces.\n\nLet's analyze the environments for the hypothetical \"oleophile\" cell:\n- **External Environment:** A nonpolar solvent (hexane). For the membrane to be stable, its outer surface must be nonpolar.\n- **Internal Environment:** An aqueous cytosol. For the membrane to be stable, its inner surface, which faces the cytosol, must be polar.\n\nThe membrane's components must therefore be able to interface with both a polar and a nonpolar environment. This requires the molecules to be **amphipathic**, possessing both polar (hydrophilic) and nonpolar (hydrophobic) regions. Standard phospholipids fit this description.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option based on these principles:\n\n**A. A monolayer composed of standard amphipathic lipids, with their hydrophilic heads facing the internal aqueous cytosol and their hydrophobic tails facing the external nonpolar solvent.**\n- **External Interface:** The hydrophobic tails face the nonpolar solvent. This is a favorable nonpolar-nonpolar interaction.\n- **Internal Interface:** The hydrophilic heads face the polar aqueous cytosol. This is a favorable polar-polar interaction.\n- **Conclusion:** This arrangement creates stable interfaces with both the exterior and interior environments. It forms a continuous, stable barrier separating the two distinct phases. This configuration is the most energetically favorable and plausible solution.\n\n**B. A standard lipid bilayer, identical to that of a terrestrial cell...**\n- **Arrangement:** Hydrophilic heads face outwards, and hydrophobic tails form an inner core.\n- **External Interface:** The hydrophilic heads would be exposed to the nonpolar solvent. This polar-nonpolar interaction is highly unfavorable and would make the membrane unstable.\n- **Conclusion:** This option is not viable.\n\n**C. An \"inverted\" lipid bilayer, where standard amphipathic lipids arrange with their hydrophobic tails facing both the external solvent and the interior cytosol...**\n- **Arrangement:** Hydrophobic tails point towards both the exterior and interior, with hydrophilic heads forming the core of the bilayer.\n- **External Interface:** The hydrophobic tails face the nonpolar solvent. This is a stable interaction.\n- **Internal Interface:** The hydrophobic tails would face the polar aqueous cytosol. This nonpolar-polar interaction is highly unfavorable and would destabilize the membrane.\n- **Conclusion:** This option is not viable.\n\n**D. A bilayer composed of novel \"anti-amphipathic\" lipids that have nonpolar heads and polar tails...**\n- Let's analyze a bilayer made of such molecules. To have a nonpolar outer surface and a polar inner surface, the outer leaflet molecules would need to orient their nonpolar heads outwards, and the inner leaflet molecules would orient their polar tails inwards toward the cytosol. The core of the membrane would then consist of the polar tails of the outer leaflet molecules interacting with the nonpolar heads of the inner leaflet molecules. This polar-nonpolar interface within the core of the membrane would be highly unstable.\n- **Conclusion:** No simple bilayer arrangement of these hypothetical molecules can create a stable membrane under the given conditions.\n\n**E. A thick membrane composed of purely nonpolar lipids...**\n- **Interaction:** Purely nonpolar molecules are fully miscible with the nonpolar hexane solvent. They would not form a distinct, stable boundary separating the cell from its environment. Instead, they would tend to dissolve into the solvent. Furthermore, they cannot form a stable interface with the internal aqueous cytosol.\n- **Conclusion:** This would not form a cohesive membrane.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only structure that satisfies the thermodynamic requirements for stability in both the internal polar and external nonpolar environments is the monolayer described in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2319283"}, {"introduction": "While the principles of hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions provide a qualitative guide, scientists often need to make quantitative predictions about molecular behavior.

Consider a simplified model for designing such an interface on a protein, P1.\n\nThe interaction surface of P1 is modeled as a flat circular disk of total radius $R_{total}$. This surface is engineered to have two distinct regions: a central circular hydrophobic patch of radius $R_p$, surrounded by a peripheral hydrophilic \"sealing\" ring that extends from $R_p$ to $R_{total}$.\n\nThe thermodynamics of these interactions are governed by the following principles:\n1.  **Hydrophobic Effect**: The change in Gibbs free energy from burying a hydrophobic surface area from an aqueous solvent is given by $\\Delta G_{hydro} = -\\gamma \\cdot A_{buried}$, where $\\gamma$ is the effective interfacial tension (a positive constant with units of energy per area) and $A_{buried}$ is the area of the hydrophobic surface that becomes inaccessible to the solvent.\n2.  **On-Target Binding (P1 + P2 → P1:P2)**: Protein P1 is designed to bind to a complementary protein, P2. Upon binding, the hydrophobic patches align perfectly, burying a total area of $2\\pi R_p^2$. The complementary hydrophilic rings also align perfectly, forming a favorable \"seal\". This sealing interaction contributes a stabilizing free energy proportional to the perimeter of the patch: $\\Delta G_{seal} = -\\sigma \\cdot (2\\pi R_p)$, where $\\sigma$ is the favorable seal line tension (a positive constant with units of energy per length).\n3.  **Off-Target Aggregation (P1 + P1 → P1_2)**: Two identical P1 proteins can undergo self-aggregation. In this process, the two hydrophobic patches align and bury a total area of $2\\pi R_p^2$. However, because the proteins are identical, their peripheral hydrophilic rings are non-complementary and clash upon self-association. This clash introduces a destabilizing free energy penalty proportional to the area of one of the clashing rings: $\\Delta G_{clash} = \\beta \\cdot A_{ring}$, where $\\beta$ is the clash penalty (a positive constant with units of energy per area) and $A_{ring}$ is the area of the hydrophilic ring on a single protein.\n\nYour task is to determine the optimal design of the hydrophobic patch. Specifically, find the radius $R_p$ that maximizes the thermodynamic selectivity for on-target binding over off-target aggregation. This selectivity is maximized by maximizing the difference in the Gibbs free energies of the two processes, $\\Delta \\Delta G = \\Delta G_{agg} - \\Delta G_{bind}$.\n\nAssuming that a physically meaningful solution exists within the constraint $0 < R_p < R_{total}$, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the optimal patch radius, $R_{p, opt}$, in terms of the given parameters.", "solution": "Let the hydrophobic patch on each protein be a disk of radius $R_{p}$ and the outer hydrophilic ring extend from $R_{p}$ to $R_{total}$.
