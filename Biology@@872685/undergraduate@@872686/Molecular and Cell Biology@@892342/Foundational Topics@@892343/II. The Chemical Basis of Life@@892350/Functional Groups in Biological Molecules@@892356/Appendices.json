This practice explores how the ability to form hydrogen bonds, a direct consequence of a molecule's functional group, dictates its solubility in water, the universal solvent of life. By comparing an alcohol and an ether with the same molecular formula, we can isolate the effect of the hydroxyl group on intermolecular interactions [@problem_id:2316612].", "problem": "Consider two distinct, uncharged structural isomers with the molecular formula $C_3H_8O$.\n- **Compound A** is propan-1-ol, which has a hydroxyl group ($-OH$) bonded to a terminal carbon atom.\n- **Compound B** is methoxyethane, an ether where an oxygen atom is bonded to a methyl group ($-CH_3$) and an ethyl group ($-CH_2CH_3$).\n\nA biochemist is developing an aqueous buffer solution and needs to select an organic cosolvent. The miscibility of the cosolvent in water is a critical factor.

Compound A is significantly more soluble in water than Compound B.\n\nB. Compound B is significantly more soluble in water than Compound A.\n\nC. Both compounds are expected to have nearly identical, high solubility in water.\n\nD. Both compounds are nonpolar and therefore effectively insoluble in water.", "solution": "We compare the water solubility of two structural isomers with formula $C_{3}H_{8}O$ by analyzing their functional groups and resulting intermolecular interactions with water. Compound A (propan-1-ol) is a primary alcohol with a terminal $-OH$ group; Compound B (methoxyethane) is an ether with an oxygen bonded to two alkyl groups.\n\nWater is a strongly hydrogen-bonding solvent. A solute’s ability to dissolve well in water correlates with its ability to participate in hydrogen bonding and with its overall polarity relative to its hydrophobic surface area. An $-OH$ group can both donate and accept hydrogen bonds: the O–H hydrogen can donate a hydrogen bond to a water oxygen, and the oxygen lone pairs can accept a hydrogen bond from a water hydrogen. In contrast, an ether oxygen has lone pairs and thus can accept hydrogen bonds from water, but it cannot donate a hydrogen bond because it lacks an X–H bond with $X$ being an electronegative atom.\n\nTherefore, Compound A can engage in more and stronger specific interactions with water than Compound B: it can act as both hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor, whereas the ether can only act as an acceptor. Additionally, in propan-1-ol the $-OH$ group is terminal and more accessible to the aqueous hydrogen-bonding network, while in methoxyethane the oxygen is flanked by two alkyl groups, increasing hydrophobic character around the polar site and sterically hindering hydration. Since both molecules have comparable hydrophobic size (three carbons), the difference in hydrogen-bonding capacity and accessibility dominates, making the alcohol significantly more water-soluble than the ether.\n\nThus, Compound A is expected to be significantly more soluble in water than Compound B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2316612"}, {"introduction": "Beyond physical properties, functional groups are central to the chemical reactivity of biomolecules, particularly their behavior as acids and bases.
