This fundamental difference is rooted in the energetic favorability of the interactions a solute can form with the surrounding water molecules. This exercise provides a simplified model to calculate and directly compare the total interaction energy of a molecule capable of extensive hydrogen bonding with one that can only engage in weaker van der Waals forces, offering a clear illustration of hydrogen bonding's dominant role in aqueous solubility [@problem_id:2319110].", "problem": "The solubility of a molecule in water is largely dictated by the favorability of the non-covalent interactions it can form with water molecules compared to the interactions water molecules form with each other. To explore this principle, consider two small molecules: the simple sugar glyceraldehyde ($\\text{C}_3\\text{H}_6\\text{O}_3$) and the hydrocarbon propane ($\\text{C}_3\\text{H}_8$).\n\nWe will use a simplified model to estimate the total interaction energy of a single solute molecule with its surrounding water solvent. The total interaction energy is the sum of energies from all possible hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions.\n\nThe parameters and rules for this model are as follows:\n- The average energy released from the formation of one hydrogen bond between the solute and a water molecule is $E_H = 21.0 \\text{ kJ/mol}$.\n- The average van der Waals interaction energy between a single non-hydrogen atom (i.e., a carbon or oxygen atom) of the solute and the surrounding water is $E_V = 1.3 \\text{ kJ/mol}$. Hydrogen atoms on the solute are considered to have a negligible contribution to the van der Waals energy in this model.\n\nTo count the number of interactions for each molecule:\n1.  **Glyceraldehyde ($\\text{HOCH}_2-\\text{CH}(\\text{OH})-\\text{CHO}$):** This molecule has two hydroxyl (-OH) groups and one aldehyde (-CHO) group.\n    - Each hydroxyl group can form a maximum of three hydrogen bonds with water molecules.\n    - The oxygen atom of the aldehyde group can form a maximum of two hydrogen bonds with water. The hydrogen atom attached to the carbonyl carbon in the aldehyde group does not participate in hydrogen bonding.\n2.  **Propane ($\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_3$):** This molecule is a non-polar hydrocarbon.\n    - Propane cannot form any hydrogen bonds with water.\n3.  For both molecules, the total van der Waals energy is calculated based on the number of non-hydrogen atoms.\n\nBased on this model, calculate the ratio of the total estimated interaction energy for a single glyceraldehyde molecule in water to that for a single propane molecule in water. Express your answer as a single numerical value, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "We model the total interaction energy of a solute molecule in water as the sum of hydrogen bond contributions and van der Waals contributions:\n$$E_{\\text{total}}=N_{H}E_{H}+N_{V}E_{V},$$\nwhere $N_{H}$ is the number of hydrogen bonds formed with water and $N_{V}$ is the number of non-hydrogen atoms (C or O) in the solute.\n\nFor glyceraldehyde ($\\text{HOCH}_{2}-\\text{CH}(\\text{OH})-\\text{CHO}$):\n- Hydrogen bonds: each hydroxyl group contributes up to $3$ hydrogen bonds and the aldehyde oxygen contributes up to $2$ hydrogen bonds.

By analyzing the change from a polar to a nonpolar residue, you will delve into the molecular basis of the hydrophobic effect, a primary driving force in protein folding. Understanding this concept is crucial for grasping how a protein achieves its unique three-dimensional structure within the aqueous cellular environment [@problem_id:2319120].", "problem": "An enzyme that functions in the aqueous environment of the cell cytoplasm has a serine residue on its solvent-exposed surface. A point mutation occurs in the gene encoding this enzyme, causing this serine residue to be replaced by a valine residue. Both amino acids have side chains of roughly similar size, so steric effects are not the primary concern.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physical description of the change in the local interactions between this part of the protein and the surrounding water molecules?\n\nA. The new valine residue is capable of forming strong hydrogen bonds, which compels the surrounding water to adopt a highly ordered, low-entropy configuration.\n\nB. The original serine residue, being larger than a water molecule, disrupted the hydrogen-bonding network of water. Its replacement by valine allows the surrounding water molecules to become more disordered, resulting in an increase in the entropy of the water.\n\nC. The nonpolar side chain of the new valine residue is unable to participate in hydrogen bonding. Consequently, the surrounding water molecules rearrange to form a highly ordered, cage-like structure around the valine side chain to maximize their hydrogen bonds with each other, leading to a local decrease in the entropy of the water.\n\nD. Both serine and valine side chains primarily interact with water through van der Waals forces. Since their sizes are similar, the mutation leads to a negligible change in the local solvent structure and its associated entropy.\n\nE. The hydrophobic valine side chain actively repels the polar water molecules, creating a small, localized vacuum at the protein surface and thereby increasing the entropy of the bulk water.", "solution": "The problem asks us to evaluate the consequences of a mutation that replaces a polar amino acid (serine) with a nonpolar amino acid (valine) on a protein's surface, specifically concerning its interaction with the surrounding water molecules. This requires an understanding of intermolecular forces and the hydrophobic effect.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the properties of the original amino acid, serine.\nThe side chain of serine is $-\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}$. The hydroxyl group ($-\\text{OH}$) is polar due to the high electronegativity of the oxygen atom. This allows the serine side chain to act as both a hydrogen bond donor (via the hydrogen on the hydroxyl group) and a hydrogen bond acceptor (via the lone pairs on the oxygen atom). Because of this capability, a serine residue on the protein surface can integrate favorably into the extensive hydrogen-bonding network of the surrounding liquid water.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the properties of the new amino acid, valine.\nThe side chain of valine is $-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)_2$. This is an isopropyl group, which consists entirely of carbon and hydrogen atoms. The electronegativity difference between carbon and hydrogen is very small, making the C-H bonds effectively nonpolar. As a result, the entire valine side chain is nonpolar and hydrophobic. It cannot act as a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the interaction of the nonpolar valine with water (the hydrophobic effect).\nWater is a highly polar molecule that forms an extensive and dynamic network of hydrogen bonds. When a nonpolar group, like the valine side chain, is exposed to water, it cannot participate in this network. The water molecules at the interface with the nonpolar group cannot form hydrogen bonds with it. To compensate and maximize their bonding stability, these water molecules reorient themselves to form hydrogen bonds exclusively with other neighboring water molecules. This forces them into a more ordered, rigid, cage-like arrangement (often called a clathrate structure) around the nonpolar group.\n\nStep 4: Determine the thermodynamic consequences of this ordering.\nEntropy is a measure of disorder or the number of available microstates. The highly ordered, cage-like structure of water molecules around the valine side chain represents a significant reduction in their translational and rotational freedom compared to bulk water. This increased order corresponds to a decrease in the entropy of the water in that local region. This entropic penalty is the primary thermodynamic basis of the hydrophobic effect.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options based on this analysis.\n- Option A is incorrect. Valine is nonpolar and cannot form strong hydrogen bonds with water.\n- Option B is incorrect. The polar serine integrates well with water. It is the nonpolar valine that causes the water to become more ordered, not less. Therefore, the entropy of the water decreases, it does not increase.\n- Option C is correct. It accurately describes that valine is nonpolar, cannot form hydrogen bonds, and thus forces the surrounding water into an ordered, cage-like structure, which constitutes a local decrease in the entropy of the water.\n- Option D is incorrect. While van der Waals forces are present in both cases, the dominant difference is the loss of hydrogen bonding capability. The effect of replacing a polar, hydrogen-bonding group with a nonpolar one is far from negligible and is the central driver of the hydrophobic effect.\n- Option E is incorrect. The concept of \"active repulsion\" is a common misconception. The hydrophobic effect is not driven by a repulsive force between individual nonpolar and polar molecules but rather by the entropic cost of organizing water around the nonpolar solute. No vacuum is formed; the water molecules aperiodically surround the side chain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2319120"}, {"introduction": "This advanced thought experiment challenges our conventional understanding of protein stability by changing the rules of the game. By transferring a protein from its natural aqueous environment to a nonpolar solvent, we can explore how the driving forces of folding are fundamentally altered. This exercise reveals that the hydrophobic effect is not an intrinsic property but an emergent one of the solvent system, and it highlights the crucial, context-dependent role of intramolecular hydrogen bonds in stabilizing protein structure [@problem_id:2319080].", "problem": "A hypothetical globular protein, \"Solubilin-X,\" is perfectly stable and functional in an aqueous buffer at pH 7.0. Its native tertiary structure is characterized by a compact core rich in nonpolar amino acid residues, stabilized primarily by the hydrophobic effect, and a surface rich in polar and charged residues. The protein is carefully isolated from the buffer and transferred into an anhydrous (water-free) nonpolar, aprotic solvent, such as cyclohexane. Assuming the protein's covalent backbone and the ionization state of its residues remain unchanged, which of the following statements best describes the changes in the noncovalent interactions and the likely fate of the protein's overall structure?\n\nA. The protein's tertiary structure will become more compact and stable because the nonpolar solvent molecules will have strong, favorable van der Waals interactions with the protein's nonpolar core.\n\nB. The hydrophobic effect will intensify in the nonpolar solvent, driving the protein to fold even more tightly to completely exclude the nonpolar solvent from its interior.\n\nC. The relative contribution of intramolecular hydrogen bonds to the stability of the structure will decrease, leading to the rapid and complete unfolding of all secondary and tertiary structures.\n\nD. The hydrophobic effect will be eliminated as a major organizing force, and intramolecular hydrogen bonds will become the most significant stabilizing interactions for any residual structure, likely preserving some secondary structure elements even as the overall tertiary fold is lost.\n\nE. Ionic bonds between charged surface residues will be significantly weakened by the low dielectric constant of the nonpolar solvent, causing the protein to expand and denature.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the structural fate of a globular protein when moved from a polar, protic solvent (water) to a nonpolar, aprotic solvent (cyclohexane). We must analyze how the change in solvent affects the key noncovalent forces that stabilize protein structure.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the initial state in aqueous buffer.\nIn an aqueous environment, the folding of a globular protein like Solubilin-X is primarily driven by the hydrophobic effect. Water molecules form a highly ordered \"cage\" around nonpolar side chains. To maximize the entropy of the solvent (water), these nonpolar side chains are sequestered into the core of the protein, away from the water. This effect is the dominant force that organizes the protein's overall tertiary structure. Other forces, such as hydrogen bonds (stabilizing secondary structures like alpha-helices and beta-sheets), van der Waals forces (contributing to packing in the core), and ionic bonds (between charged residues), also play crucial roles.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the properties of the new solvent.\nCyclohexane is a nonpolar, aprotic solvent. \"Nonpolar\" means it interacts favorably with other nonpolar molecules (like the side chains of leucine or valine) via London dispersion forces. \"Aprotic\" means its molecules cannot act as hydrogen bond donors.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the change in the hydrophobic effect.\nThe hydrophobic effect is an emergent property of the high ordering of water molecules around nonpolar solutes. Since the new solvent is nonpolar (cyclohexane), there is no entropic penalty for solvating the protein's nonpolar side chains. In fact, these interactions are favorable (like dissolves like). Consequently, the primary driving force for maintaining a compact, folded structure with a nonpolar core is completely eliminated. The protein has no incentive to keep its nonpolar residues buried. This immediately invalidates option B, which incorrectly suggests the hydrophobic effect would intensify.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the role of intramolecular hydrogen bonds.\nIn water, a polypeptide's internal hydrogen bonds (e.g., between a backbone amide proton and a carbonyl oxygen) are in competition with hydrogen bonds to water molecules. If an internal hydrogen bond breaks, the exposed polar groups can form new hydrogen bonds with the surrounding water, mitigating the energetic cost.\nIn a nonpolar, aprotic solvent like cyclohexane, this is not possible. The solvent cannot form hydrogen bonds. Therefore, breaking an internal hydrogen bond and exposing the polar amide and carbonyl groups to the nonpolar solvent is extremely energetically unfavorable. This means that the energetic stability gained from forming an intramolecular hydrogen bond is much greater in the nonpolar solvent than it was in water. The relative contribution of hydrogen bonds to stabilizing local structure *increases* significantly. They become the most important remaining interaction for holding the polypeptide chain together in any ordered fashion. This directly invalidates option C, which claims their contribution will decrease. It strongly supports option D, which states they become the most significant stabilizing interactions for any *residual* structure. While the overall tertiary structure is lost due to the disappearance of the hydrophobic effect, the now-stronger internal hydrogen bonds can preserve secondary structure elements like alpha-helices and beta-sheets.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the role of van der Waals forces and overall compactness.\nWhile there are van der Waals (London dispersion) forces between the protein and the cyclohexane, these forces are weak and non-directional. They provide no impetus for the protein to adopt a specific, compact tertiary structure. The loss of the powerful organizing hydrophobic effect means the protein will likely unravel from its specific native fold into a more disordered state. Therefore, the claim in option A that the protein will become more compact and stable is incorrect.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the role of ionic bonds.\nThe strength of an ionic bond (a type of electrostatic interaction) is inversely proportional to the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium. Water has a very high dielectric constant (around 80), which effectively shields and weakens electrostatic interactions. A nonpolar solvent like cyclohexane has a very low dielectric constant (around 2). Therefore, any ionic bonds between charged residues on the protein would become *much stronger* in cyclohexane, not weaker. This invalidates option E. While these bonds would become stronger, the charged residues are typically on the surface and are now in a highly unfavorable nonpolar environment. They would tend to seek each other out, but this would more likely lead to aggregation of different protein molecules rather than stabilizing the original, native tertiary fold of a single molecule.\n\nStep 7: Conclusion.\nBased on the analysis, the hydrophobic effect, the main driver of tertiary folding, is lost. This causes the protein to lose its specific tertiary structure. However, intramolecular hydrogen bonds become relatively much stronger and are now the dominant force preserving any local order, such as secondary structures. Option D accurately captures this sequence of events: the elimination of the hydrophobic effect as the organizing force and the increased relative importance of hydrogen bonds in stabilizing residual structure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2319080"}]}
