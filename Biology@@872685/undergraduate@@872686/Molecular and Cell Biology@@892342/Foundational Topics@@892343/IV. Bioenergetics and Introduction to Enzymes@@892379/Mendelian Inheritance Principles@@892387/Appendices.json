This exercise introduces the concept of a recessive lethal allele, where a specific homozygous genotype is non-viable, thus altering the observable phenotypic ratios among surviving offspring. Working through this scenario demonstrates how to account for viability selection, a crucial factor in both experimental genetics and evolution [@problem_id:2953576].", "problem": "A single autosomal locus with alleles $A$ and $a$ controls a visible trait such that $A$ is completely dominant to $a$ for the trait. However, individuals with genotype $AA$ are inviable due to embryonic lethality, whereas individuals with genotypes $Aa$ and $aa$ are viable and have equal viability. Two heterozygous parents are crossed: $Aa \\times Aa$. Starting from Mendel’s law of segregation (each heterozygote produces $A$ and $a$ gametes with probability $1/2$) and the definition of viability selection (only $AA$ have viability $0$, while $Aa$ and $aa$ have viability $1$), derive the expected zygotic genotype frequencies prior to selection. Then impose the viability constraint and renormalize the surviving classes to obtain the expected phenotypic composition among live offspring.

Each parent produces two types of gametes, $A$ and $a$, each with a probability of $P(A) = 1/2$ and $P(a) = 1/2$. The formation of zygotes is the result of random fusion of these gametes. The probabilities of the resulting zygotic genotypes are calculated as follows:\n- The probability of genotype $AA$ is $P(AA) = P(A \\text{ from parent 1}) \\times P(A \\text{ from parent 2}) = (1/2) \\times (1/2) = 1/4$.\n- The probability of genotype $Aa$ is $P(Aa) = [P(A \\text{ from parent 1}) \\times P(a \\text{ from parent 2})] + [P(a \\text{ from parent 1}) \\times P(A \\text{ from parent 2})] = [(1/2) \\times (1/2)] + [(1/2) \\times (1/2)] = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2$.\n- The probability of genotype $aa$ is $P(aa) = P(a \\text{ from parent 1}) \\times P(a \\text{ from parent 2}) = (1/2) \\times (1/2) = 1/4$.\n\nThus, the expected zygotic genotype frequencies prior to selection are $P(AA) = 1/4$, $P(Aa) = 1/2$, and $P(aa) = 1/4$.\n\nNext, we impose the viability constraint. The viability of genotype $AA$ is $w_{AA} = 0$, while the viabilities of genotypes $Aa$ and $aa$ are $w_{Aa} = 1$ and $w_{aa} = 1$, respectively. The frequency of each genotype class after selection is proportional to its initial frequency multiplied by its relative viability.\n- The post-selection frequency of $AA$ is $P(AA) \\times w_{AA} = (1/4) \\times 0 = 0$.\n- The post-selection frequency of $Aa$ is $P(Aa) \\times w_{Aa} = (1/2) \\times 1 = 1/2$.\n- The post-selection frequency of $aa$ is $P(aa) \\times w_{aa} = (1/4) \\times 1 = 1/4$.\n\nThe total proportion of surviving offspring is the sum of these post-selection frequencies:\n$$ \\text{Total survival proportion} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} $$\nTo find the expected frequencies among the live offspring, we must renormalize the surviving classes by dividing their post-selection frequencies by the total survival proportion.\n- The frequency of genotype $Aa$ among surviving progeny is $P'(Aa) = \\frac{P(Aa) \\times w_{Aa}}{\\text{Total survival proportion}} = \\frac{1/2}{3/4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n- The frequency of genotype $aa$ among surviving progeny is $P'(aa) = \\frac{P(aa) \\times w_{aa}}{\\text{Total survival proportion}} = \\frac{1/4}{3/4} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe expected genotypic ratio among live offspring is $2 Aa : 1 aa$.\n\nFinally, we determine the phenotypic composition. Allele $A$ is completely dominant to allele $a$.\n- Individuals with genotype $Aa$ will exhibit the dominant phenotype.\n- Individuals with genotype $aa$ will exhibit the recessive phenotype.\nThe genotype $AA$, which would also have shown the dominant phenotype, does not survive.\n\nThe proportion of surviving progeny that exhibit the dominant phenotype is the frequency of the $Aa$ genotype among the survivors, which is $2/3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$$", "id": "2953576"}, {"introduction": "While some genes assort independently, many are physically linked on the same chromosome and tend to be inherited together.
