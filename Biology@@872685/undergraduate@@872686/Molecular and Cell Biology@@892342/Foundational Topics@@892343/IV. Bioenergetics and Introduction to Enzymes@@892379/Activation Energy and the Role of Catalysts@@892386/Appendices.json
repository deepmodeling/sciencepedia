A site-directed mutation is introduced in the active site of the enzyme, changing a critical lysine residue to an alanine. Experimental analysis reveals two key findings:\n1. The mutated enzyme shows no detectable catalytic activity above the background rate of the uncatalyzed reaction.\n2. The standard Gibbs free energy change ($\\Delta G^{\\circ'}$) for the conversion of xylosonate to 2-keto-3-deoxy-xylosonate in solution is identical, regardless of whether the wild-type enzyme, the mutated enzyme, or no enzyme is present.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for these observations?\n\nA. The mutation raises the free energy of the transition state for the reaction, thereby increasing the activation energy, but does not alter the free energies of the substrate or the product.\n\nB. The mutation increases the overall standard Gibbs free energy change ($\\Delta G^{\\circ'}$), making the reaction thermodynamically unfavorable and thus preventing it from proceeding.\n\nC. The mutation destabilizes the ground state of the substrate when it binds to the enzyme, which prevents the reaction from initiating.\n\nD. The mutation specifically stabilizes the product, which increases the activation energy for the forward reaction and halts catalysis.\n\nE. The mutation changes the equilibrium constant ($K_{\\text{eq}}$) of the reaction to favor the substrate so strongly that product formation is negligible.", "solution": "We analyze the thermodynamics and kinetics of the reaction and the effects of catalysis and mutation using standard relationships.\n\nFirst, the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction in solution relates to the equilibrium constant by\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ'}=-RT\\ln K_{\\text{eq}}.\n$$\nThe observation that $\\Delta G^{\\circ'}$ is identical whether the wild-type enzyme, the mutant enzyme, or no enzyme is present implies that $K_{\\text{eq}}$ is unchanged by the presence or absence of either enzyme. This establishes that the standard free energies of the substrate and the product, denoted $G_{S}^{\\circ'}$ and $G_{P}^{\\circ'}$ with $\\Delta G^{\\circ'}=G_{P}^{\\circ'}-G_{S}^{\\circ'}$, are not altered by either enzyme. Therefore, any claim that the mutation changes $\\Delta G^{\\circ'}$ or $K_{\\text{eq}}$ is incompatible with the data. This rules out statements B and E. Moreover, any mechanism that specifically stabilizes the product relative to the substrate would change $\\Delta G^{\\circ'}$ (and thus $K_{\\text{eq}}$), contradicting the observation; therefore D is also ruled out.\n\nSecond, the rates are governed by activation free energies via transition state theory. For a given pathway, the rate constant is\n$$\nk=\\frac{k_{B}T}{h}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{RT}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}=G_{\\text{TS}}-G_{S}$ is the activation free energy, with $G_{\\text{TS}}$ the transition state free energy and $G_{S}$ the ground-state substrate free energy along that pathway. A catalyst accelerates the reaction by lowering $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, typically by stabilizing the transition state. Let $G_{\\text{TS}}^{\\text{wt}}$, $G_{\\text{TS}}^{\\text{mut}}$, and $G_{\\text{TS}}^{\\text{uncat}}$ denote the transition state free energies along the wild-type, mutant, and uncatalyzed pathways, respectively. The observation that the mutant shows no detectable catalytic activity above background implies\n$k_{\\text{mut}}\\approx k_{\\text{uncat}}$, which implies $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{mut}}\\approx \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{uncat}}$,\nhence\n$G_{\\text{TS}}^{\\text{mut}}\\approx G_{\\text{TS}}^{\\text{uncat}}$.\nBy contrast, the wild-type enzyme must have\n$\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{wt}}<\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{uncat}}$, which implies $G_{\\text{TS}}^{\\text{wt}}<G_{\\text{TS}}^{\\text{uncat}}$.\nTherefore, the mutation that replaces the catalytic lysine with alanine eliminates transition state stabilization, effectively raising the transition state free energy back toward the uncatalyzed level and increasing the activation energy, while leaving $G_{S}^{\\circ'}$ and $G_{P}^{\\circ'}$ (and thus $\\Delta G^{\\circ'}$ and $K_{\\text{eq}}$) unchanged. This is the most fundamental and accurate explanation of both observations.\n\nFinally, option C posits destabilization of the ground state of the bound substrate. Ground-state destabilization, if anything, can lower $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ relative to that bound state and does not directly account for the loss of catalytic rate to the uncatalyzed background. More importantly, it does not address the central, general principle that enzymes act by stabilizing the transition state without altering the thermodynamics of reactants and products. Hence C is not the most accurate explanation.\n\nThus, the correct choice is that the mutation raises the free energy of the transition state (removes its stabilization), increasing the activation energy, without changing the free energies of substrate or product or the overall $\\Delta G^{\\circ'}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2316428"}, {"introduction": "Having established that enzymes lower activation energy by stabilizing the transition state, we can now ask: how is this achieved at the molecular level?

The reaction proceeds through a high-energy transition state with significant negative charge character on the alpha-carbon after the carboxyl group departs.

(Arg, Met, Pro)", "solution": "The core task is to design a catalytic center within a peptide to facilitate the decarboxylation of acetoacetate. The reaction is:\n$$ \\text{CH}_3\\text{COCH}_2\\text{COO}^- + \\text{H}^+ \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_3\\text{COCH}_3 + \\text{CO}_2 $$\nThe key challenge described is the stabilization of a high-energy intermediate or transition state that has a significant carbanion character on the carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group. A successful catalyst must lower the activation energy of the reaction, which is achieved by providing a lower-energy reaction pathway. Let's analyze the most effective catalytic strategies and evaluate the given options.\n\nThere are two main strategies to stabilize the developing negative charge on the alpha-carbon during decarboxylation:\n1.  **Non-covalent Stabilization**: This involves using nearby positively charged groups (electrostatic stabilization) or hydrogen bond donors to stabilize the negative charge of the carbanion intermediate. This is a possible, but generally less efficient, catalytic mechanism.\n2.  **Covalent Catalysis**: This strategy involves the temporary formation of a covalent bond between the substrate and a residue on the enzyme. This creates an alternative reaction pathway with intermediates that are more stable than the carbanion.\n\nFor carbonyl compounds like acetoacetate, the most powerful and common biological strategy for decarboxylation is covalent catalysis via the formation of a **Schiff base** (or imine). This involves a nucleophilic attack on the substrate's ketone carbon by a primary amine, typically from the side chain of a **Lysine** residue.\n\nThe Schiff base mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1.  The primary amine of a Lysine side chain attacks the ketone of acetoacetate, forming a protonated Schiff base intermediate.\n2.  The substrate, now covalently linked to the peptizyme, undergoes decarboxylation. The key advantage here is that the electron pair (the \"negative charge\") from the broken C-C bond does not form a high-energy carbanion. Instead, it is delocalized into the iminium system, forming a stable, neutral enamine intermediate. The positively charged nitrogen acts as an \"electron sink,\" effectively stabilizing the charge.\n3.  The enamine is then hydrolyzed to release the acetone product and regenerate the free amine of the Lysine residue, completing the catalytic cycle.\n\nThis mechanism requires not only a primary amine (from Lysine) but also general acid/base catalysts to facilitate proton transfers during Schiff base formation and hydrolysis.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options based on their ability to support this superior catalytic mechanism:\n\n**A. (Asp, Glu, His)**: This triplet consists of acidic (Asp, Glu) and basic (His) residues. They could participate in general acid-base catalysis or provide electrostatic stabilization for a carbanion. However, none of them possesses a primary amine capable of forming a Schiff base. This catalytic center would be relatively inefficient.\n\n**B. (Trp, Phe, Val)**: These residues are all large and hydrophobic (or aromatic). They would be excellent for creating a nonpolar binding pocket for the substrate but lack any functional groups for chemical catalysis (acid-base, covalent, etc.).\n\n**C. (Lys, Tyr, Asp)**: This is the most promising option.\n*   **Lysine (Lys)**: Provides the essential primary $\\epsilon$-amino group to form a Schiff base, creating the highly effective electron sink pathway.\n*   **Tyrosine (Tyr)**: The hydroxyl group of Tyr is an excellent hydrogen bond donor and can act as a general acid-base catalyst. It could polarize the substrate's carbonyl group to facilitate the initial attack by Lysine, and later donate a proton to the enamine intermediate during product release.\n*   **Aspartate (Asp)**: The negatively charged carboxylate group can act as a general base to accept a proton during the reaction. It can also help orient the positively charged Lysine residue by electrostatic interaction (pKa modulation) or interact directly with the substrate. This triad provides all the necessary components for a sophisticated and efficient catalytic mechanism.\n\n**D. (Ser, Thr, Cys)**: These residues have nucleophilic side chains (hydroxyls for Ser/Thr, thiol for Cys). While they can act as nucleophiles, the primary amine of Lysine is uniquely suited for forming a Schiff base with a ketone that can effectively stabilize the decarboxylation intermediate through resonance. The hydroxyls are weaker nucleophiles, and a thioester intermediate (from Cys) would not provide the same \"electron sink\" benefit for decarboxylation.\n\n**E. (Arg, Met, Pro)**: \n*   **Arginine (Arg)**: While positively charged, its guanidinium group is resonance-stabilized, making it a very poor nucleophile compared to Lysine's primary amine. It cannot effectively form a Schiff base. It could offer electrostatic stabilization, but this is less effective.\n*   **Methionine (Met)**: Its thioether side chain is largely non-reactive in this context.\n*   **Proline (Pro)**: It is a secondary amine and structurally disruptive to alpha-helical structures, which are common in such scaffolds. It cannot form a Schiff base in the required manner.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of Lysine, Tyrosine, and Aspartate provides the most complete and efficient catalytic machinery. Lysine enables the superior covalent catalysis pathway via a Schiff base, while Tyrosine and Aspartate provide the necessary auxiliary functions of general acid-base catalysis and electrostatic positioning.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2302373"}]}
