This foundational exercise guides you through the logic of designing a decisive experiment to distinguish between these two possibilities. By considering how different enzymes affect RNA and protein, you can establish the chemical nature of an unknown catalyst, a critical skill in molecular biology [@problem_id:2344452].", "problem": "A molecular biology student has isolated a purified preparation of a specific RNA molecule, named \"Cleav-RNA,\" from an extremophilic bacterium. In a buffered solution containing magnesium ions, this Cleav-RNA preparation is observed to catalyze the cleavage of a specific target substrate RNA molecule into two smaller fragments. A supervisor raises a critical point: the observed catalytic activity might not be an intrinsic property of the Cleav-RNA (i.e., it is not a ribozyme), but could be due to a highly active, trace-level contaminating protein, specifically a ribonuclease (RNase), that co-purified with the RNA.\n\nThe student has access to the following reagents: the purified Cleav-RNA preparation, the target substrate RNA, a broad-spectrum protease that degrades all proteins, and a generic RNase that degrades most RNA molecules. The student's goal is to design a single, decisive experiment to distinguish between the two possibilities: that the catalyst is the Cleav-RNA itself or a contaminating protein.\n\nWhich of the following experimental designs provides the most rigorous and conclusive evidence to determine the chemical nature of the catalyst?\n\nA. Divide the Cleav-RNA preparation into two samples. Treat one with protease and leave the other untreated. Then, add the substrate RNA to both and measure the reaction rate. If the rates are similar, the catalyst is RNA.\n\nB. Divide the Cleav-RNA preparation into three samples. Leave one as an untreated control. Treat the second sample with protease. Treat the third sample with a generic RNase. Afterwards, add the substrate RNA to all three samples and compare the cleavage activity.\n\nC. Run the Cleav-RNA preparation on a high-resolution protein gel and stain it with a highly sensitive silver stain. If no protein bands are visible, it confirms the activity is from the RNA.\n\nD. Divide the Cleav-RNA preparation into two samples. Boil one sample for 10 minutes and then cool it to the reaction temperature, leaving the other sample unboiled. Add the substrate RNA to both and measure the activity.\n\nE. Divide the Cleav-RNA preparation into two samples. Treat one with a generic RNase and leave the other untreated.

If the activity is lost in the treated sample, the catalyst is RNA.", "solution": "We need to determine whether the catalytic activity in the Cleav-RNA preparation is due to RNA (a ribozyme) or a contaminating protein (RNase). The decisive principle is differential susceptibility of catalysts to proteases and RNases:\n- Protease degrades proteins but does not degrade RNA; thus, true RNA-based catalysis should be resistant to protease.\n- RNase degrades RNA; thus, a ribozyme catalyst should be abolished by RNase, whereas a protein catalyst should remain intact after RNase treatment.\n\nDefine the measurable outcome as the initial cleavage rate of the substrate RNA under otherwise identical buffer and metal ion conditions. Let $v_{0}$ be the rate for the untreated preparation, $v_{P}$ be the rate after protease treatment, and $v_{N}$ be the rate after RNase treatment. The experimental design must include a no-treatment control and independent treatments with protease and RNase applied to the catalyst preparation before the substrate is introduced. To avoid confounds, enzymatic treatments should be followed by appropriate inactivation or removal prior to adding the substrate RNA, so that any loss of activity reflects loss of catalyst rather than ongoing degradation of the substrate by residual RNase.\n\nDecision logic based on biochemical specificity:\n- If the catalyst is RNA (ribozyme): protease should not affect the RNA catalyst, so $v_{P} \\approx v_{0}$; RNase should degrade the RNA catalyst, so $v_{N} \\approx 0$.\n- If the catalyst is protein (contaminating RNase): protease should degrade the protein catalyst, so $v_{P} \\approx 0$; RNase should not affect the protein catalyst, so $v_{N} \\approx v_{0}$.\n\nTherefore, the most rigorous single experiment is to split the preparation into three aliquots: untreated control, protease-treated, and RNase-treated, then assay activity in all three with identical substrate and conditions. This is exactly option B. \n\nWhy the other options are not conclusive:\n- A lacks the RNase arm; if $v_{P} \\approx v_{0}$, the catalyst could still be a protease-resistant protein, so it is not decisive.\n- C relies on failure to detect trace protein by staining, which lacks sufficient sensitivity to rule out catalysis by trace contaminants.\n- D boiling can disrupt both proteins and RNA folding; loss or retention of activity is not specific to chemical nature of the catalyst.\n- E lacks the protease control and is confounded because RNase can also destroy the substrate RNA, abolishing apparent activity regardless of the catalyst.\n\nThus, only B provides the necessary and sufficient controls to decisively determine the chemical nature of the catalyst by comparing $v_{0}$, $v_{P}$, and $v_{N}$ with clear, mutually exclusive outcomes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2344452"}, {"introduction": "Once a molecule is confirmed as a ribozyme, the next step is to understand its mechanism. This practice explores the chemical basis of RNA catalysis by examining the crucial role of the 2'-hydroxyl group, a feature that distinguishes RNA from DNA. Using hypothetical data from a deoxyribonucleotide substitution experiment, you will quantitatively analyze how specific changes in the catalytic core affect the ribozyme's efficiency, providing insight into its structure-function relationship [@problem_id:2344491].", "problem": "A researcher is investigating the catalytic mechanism of a hammerhead ribozyme as a model system for the Ribonucleic acid (RNA) world hypothesis. The ribozyme is a chimeric molecule, constructed primarily from Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for enhanced stability, but its catalytic core, responsible for cleaving a specific RNA substrate, is composed of RNA. The catalytic activity is quantified by the observed first-order rate constant, $k_{obs}$.\n\nThe researcher proposes a model where the overall catalytic rate is a product of a basal rate constant, $k_{basal}$, and several catalytic factors, $f_i$, each representing the contribution of the 2'-hydroxyl group at a specific nucleotide position in the core. The model is given by $k_{obs} = k_{basal} \\times \\prod_{i} f_i$. If a ribonucleotide at position $i$ is present, its factor $f_i > 1$. If it is substituted with a deoxyribonucleotide, which lacks the 2'-hydroxyl group, its contribution factor becomes 1 ($f_i = 1$).\n\nThe wild-type (WT) ribozyme, with a fully RNA-based catalytic core, is assayed. Subsequently, three different single-substitution mutants are created by replacing a single ribonucleotide in the core with its corresponding deoxyribonucleotide at positions G5, A9, and G8, respectively. The measured rate constants are as follows:\n\n-   WT ribozyme (all-RNA core): $k_{obs, WT} = 1.20\\ \\text{min}^{-1}$\n-   dG5 mutant (G at position 5 is deoxyguanosine): $k_{obs, dG5} = 0.080\\ \\text{min}^{-1}$\n-   dA9 mutant (A at position 9 is deoxyadenosine): $k_{obs, dA9} = 0.40\\ \\text{min}^{-1}$\n-   dG8 mutant (G at position 8 is deoxyguanosine): $k_{obs, dG8} = 0.024\\ \\text{min}^{-1}$\n\nBased on this model and the provided data, a new double mutant is constructed with deoxyribonucleotide substitutions at positions G5 and G8 simultaneously (dG5/dG8 mutant).

The solution is based on the multiplicative model provided: $k_{obs} = k_{basal} \\times \\prod_{i} f_i$.\n\nLet the key catalytic contributions come from the 2'-hydroxyl groups at positions G5, A9, and G8. The corresponding contribution factors are $f_{G5}$, $f_{A9}$, and $f_{G8}$.\n\nThe observed rate constant for the wild-type (WT) ribozyme, which has ribonucleotides at all three positions, is given by:\n$$k_{WT} = k_{basal} \\times f_{G5} \\times f_{A9} \\times f_{G8}$$\n\nWhen a ribonucleotide at a specific position is replaced by a deoxyribonucleotide, its corresponding factor becomes 1. Thus, for the single mutants, the rate constants are:\n-   For the dG5 mutant: $k_{dG5} = k_{basal} \\times (1) \\times f_{A9} \\times f_{G8} = k_{basal} \\times f_{A9} \\times f_{G8}$\n-   For the dA9 mutant: $k_{dA9} = k_{basal} \\times f_{G5} \\times (1) \\times f_{G8} = k_{basal} \\times f_{G5} \\times f_{G8}$\n-   For the dG8 mutant: $k_{dG8} = k_{basal} \\times f_{G5} \\times f_{A9} \\times (1) = k_{basal} \\times f_{G5} \\times f_{A9}$\n\nThe problem asks for the rate constant of the double mutant dG5/dG8. In this mutant, the ribonucleotides at positions G5 and G8 are replaced by deoxyribonucleotides, so both $f_{G5}$ and $f_{G8}$ become 1. The ribonucleotide at position A9 remains, so its factor $f_{A9}$ is still active. Therefore, the rate constant for the double mutant is:\n$$k_{dG5/dG8} = k_{basal} \\times (1) \\times f_{A9} \\times (1) = k_{basal} \\times f_{A9}$$\n\nTo find the value of $k_{dG5/dG8}$, we need to determine the product $k_{basal} \\times f_{A9}$. We can do this by combining the given equations without explicitly solving for each individual factor or the basal rate.\n\nLet's manipulate the expressions for the measured rate constants.

The input values $0.080$ and $0.024$ have two significant figures, while $1.20$ has three.
