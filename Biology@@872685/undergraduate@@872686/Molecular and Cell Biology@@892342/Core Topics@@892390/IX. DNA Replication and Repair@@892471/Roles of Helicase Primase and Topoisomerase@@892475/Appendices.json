{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To understand the role of topoisomerase, we must first appreciate the topology of DNA. A circular DNA molecule, like a plasmid, possesses a topological property called the linking number ($L_k$), which is the sum of its twist ($T_w$) and writhe ($W_r$). This exercise provides a quantitative look at how Type I topoisomerases alter this fundamental property, changing the linking number in discrete steps to relieve the torsional stress of supercoiling. By working through this problem [@problem_id:2337018], you will calculate the direct impact of a single enzymatic event on a plasmid's topology.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is studying a 4200 base pair (bp) covalently closed circular DNA plasmid. Under the experimental conditions, the plasmid adopts a B-form DNA conformation with a helical pitch ($h_0$) of 10.5 base pairs per helical turn in its most stable, relaxed state. Gel electrophoresis analysis reveals that the supercoiled plasmid isolated from the cell has a writhe ($W_r$) of -20.\n\nThe researcher then incubates this plasmid with a purified sample of Type I DNA topoisomerase. This enzyme functions by creating a transient single-strand break, allowing the intact strand to pass through, and then resealing the break, thereby altering the DNA's topology.\n\nCalculate the new linking number of the plasmid after the topoisomerase has completed exactly one single, complete catalytic cycle to begin the process of relaxing the plasmid's superhelical stress. The final answer should be a single integer.", "solution": "For a covalently closed circular DNA, the Calugareanu-White relation gives the topological invariant linking number as\n$$\nL_{k} = T_{w} + W_{r}\n$$\nIn the relaxed B-form state, the twist equals the relaxed linking number, with\n$$\nT_{w,0} = L_{k,0} = \\frac{N_{\\text{bp}}}{h_{0}} = \\frac{4200}{10.5} = 400\n$$\nThe isolated supercoiled plasmid has a measured writhe $W_{r} = -20$. Assuming the twist remains at its relaxed value under these conditions, the initial linking number of the supercoiled plasmid is\n$$\nL_{k,\\text{initial}} = L_{k,0} + W_{r} = 400 + (-20) = 380\n$$\nA Type I DNA topoisomerase changes the linking number in integer steps of one per catalytic cycle. Because the enzyme relaxes negative supercoils, it increases $L_{k}$ by $+1$ in one cycle.

While helicase unwinds the double helix to expose the template strands, this action introduces severe torsional strain, or positive supercoiling, ahead of the replication fork. This practice explores the crucial partnership between helicase and topoisomerase, challenging you to calculate the rate at which topoisomerase must work to counteract the supercoiling generated by helicase, ensuring that replication can proceed smoothly [@problem_id:2336988].", "problem": "In an *in vitro* experiment designed to study the dynamics of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) replication, a researcher uses a covalently closed circular plasmid. The plasmid DNA is in the standard B-form, which has a helical pitch of 10.5 base pairs (bp) per turn. The replication process is initiated at a single origin, and a helicase enzyme moves along the DNA, unwinding the double helix to create a single replication fork. The replication fork is observed to advance at a constant rate of 315 bp per second.\n\nTo manage the topological strain that builds up ahead of the advancing fork, a eukaryotic Type I topoisomerase is included in the reaction mixture. Assume this enzyme works with perfect efficiency, meaning it completely and instantaneously relaxes any supercoiling that is induced by the helicase activity.\n\nTo maintain a constant topological state (i.e., to prevent any net change in superhelical density) in the unreplicated portion of the plasmid, what is the required rate of change in the linking number, expressed in units of linking number per minute, that must be catalyzed by the topoisomerase?", "solution": "A covalently closed circular DNA has its total linking number conserved unless changed by topoisomerase activity. As the helicase advances, it unwinds the duplex, removing helical turns at a rate equal to the base pairs unwound per time divided by the helical pitch. This induces positive supercoiling ahead of the fork; to maintain a constant topological state (no net change in superhelical density) in the unreplicated region, the topoisomerase must change the linking number at the opposite rate.\n\nLet the helical pitch be $p=10.5$ bp per turn and the fork speed be $v=315$ bp per second. The number of helical turns unwound per second is\n$$\nr=\\frac{v}{p}=\\frac{315}{10.5}=30\\ \\text{turns per second}\n$$\nTo keep the unreplicated region relaxed, the required rate of change of linking number due to topoisomerase is\n$$\n\\frac{d\\,\\mathrm{Lk}}{dt}=-r=-30\\ \\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nConverting to per minute,\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d\\,\\mathrm{Lk}}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{per minute}}=-30\\times 60=-1800\\ \\text{min}^{-1}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the topoisomerase must decrease the linking number to counteract the positive supercoils generated by helicase activity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1800}$$", "id": "2336988"}, {"introduction": "Lagging strand synthesis presents a unique puzzle: it must be synthesized discontinuously in short Okazaki fragments. Each fragment requires a primer, a task fulfilled by the enzyme primase. This conceptual exercise [@problem_id:2337032] explores a fundamental question: why does primase synthesize primers from RNA (ribonucleotides) and not DNA (deoxyribonucleotides)? By considering a hypothetical mutant, you will uncover the critical downstream consequences and appreciate why the chemical identity of the primer is essential for creating a final, continuous DNA strand.", "problem": "In a hypothetical prokaryotic organism, a mutation occurs in the gene encoding the enzyme primase. This mutant primase synthesizes primers using deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) instead of the usual ribonucleotides (rNTPs). All other enzymes involved in DNA replication, including helicase, DNA polymerase I, DNA polymerase III, topoisomerase, and DNA ligase, are unchanged and function normally. Consider the process of lagging strand synthesis in this mutant organism. Which of the following statements describes the most direct and significant challenge that will prevent the completion of a continuous lagging strand?\n\nA. DNA polymerase III will be unable to extend the deoxyribonucleotide primers because it requires an RNA-DNA hybrid junction to initiate synthesis.\n\nB. The deoxyribonucleotide primers will be rapidly degraded by the 3' to 5' proofreading exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase III, preventing the synthesis of Okazaki fragments.\n\nC. Topoisomerase will be unable to relieve the positive supercoiling ahead of the replication fork because the all-DNA Okazaki fragments will alter the helical tension of the parent molecule.\n\nD. DNA polymerase I will be unable to remove the deoxyribonucleotide primers, which in turn prevents DNA ligase from joining the Okazaki fragments.\n\nE. DNA ligase will mistakenly identify the deoxyribonucleotide primers as DNA damage and recruit repair enzymes, stalling the entire replication fork.", "solution": "We analyze the canonical steps of lagging strand synthesis and assess which step fails when primase synthesizes DNA primers (dNTPs) rather than RNA primers (rNTPs), while all other enzymes are normal.\n\nStep 1: Initiation and elongation by DNA polymerase III. DNA polymerase III requires only a free $3'$-hydroxyl to initiate extension; it does not require an RNA–DNA junction. Therefore, if primase lays a DNA primer, DNA polymerase III can still extend from the primer’s $3'$-OH to synthesize an Okazaki fragment. Hence, the claim that DNA polymerase III would be unable to extend because it needs an RNA–DNA junction is incorrect, eliminating option A.\n\nStep 2: Proofreading by DNA polymerase III. The $3' \\to 5'$ exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase III removes only misincorporated nucleotides from the growing strand terminus. It does not act upstream to degrade intact primers (whether RNA or DNA). Therefore, it will not rapidly degrade the DNA primers and block Okazaki fragment synthesis, eliminating option B.\n\nStep 3: Topological control by topoisomerase. Topoisomerase relieves supercoils ahead of the fork independently of whether Okazaki fragments are initiated with RNA or DNA. The chemical nature of primers in Okazaki fragments does not alter the helical tension of the parental duplex in a way that would disable topoisomerase function, eliminating option C.\n\nStep 4: Okazaki fragment maturation—primer removal and nick sealing. In bacteria, RNA primers on the lagging strand are normally removed by RNase H (which specifically degrades RNA in RNA–DNA hybrids) and by the $5' \\to 3'$ exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I, which performs nick translation while filling the resulting gap with DNA. Crucially:\n- RNase H cannot degrade DNA; it requires RNA in an RNA–DNA hybrid.\n- The standard maturation pathway relies on removal of primers to create a ligatable nick and then sealing by DNA ligase, which requires a $3'$-OH and a $5'$-monophosphate on DNA substrates.\n\nWith DNA primers, RNase H cannot act at all. The maturation step must therefore depend on DNA polymerase I’s ability to remove the primer. In the canonical framework of this question, DNA polymerase I is described as the enzyme that removes RNA primers via its $5' \\to 3'$ exonuclease while filling with DNA; if primers are DNA, this specific RNA-primer removal function is not available. Consequently, primer removal fails, and DNA ligase cannot join Okazaki fragments. This directly prevents formation of a continuous lagging strand. Thus, the most direct and significant challenge among the provided choices is that DNA polymerase I will be unable to remove the deoxyribonucleotide primers, blocking ligation, which corresponds to option D.\n\nStep 5: Excluding option E. DNA ligase does not act as a DNA damage sensor recruiting repair enzymes to DNA–DNA junctions; its role is to seal nicks given proper termini chemistry. Therefore, E is not the direct block.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2337032"}]}
