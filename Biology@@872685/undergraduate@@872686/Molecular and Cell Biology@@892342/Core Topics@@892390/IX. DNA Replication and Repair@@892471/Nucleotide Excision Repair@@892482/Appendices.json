{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The Nucleotide Excision Repair pathway operates like a highly specific cellular emergency service, and every response begins with a crucial first step: detecting the problem. This practice problem focuses on the role of the XPC protein, the primary damage sensor in the global genome repair sub-pathway. By considering a scenario where this sensor is disabled, you can explore why successful damage recognition is the non-negotiable gateway to initiating the entire repair process [@problem_id:1506424].", "problem": "In a molecular biology laboratory, a researcher is studying a specific human cell line that has been genetically engineered to possess a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the Xeroderma Pigmentosum, Complementation group C (XPC) protein. The XPC protein is known to be involved in DNA repair. To investigate the consequences of this mutation, the researcher exposes a culture of these cells to a controlled dose of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which is known to cause the formation of bulky lesions, primarily pyrimidine dimers, in the DNA.\n\nAssuming the cells are not currently undergoing DNA replication, which of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate fate of a pyrimidine dimer formed within the genome of one of these cells, specifically in the context of the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) pathway?\n\nA. The pyrimidine dimer will be recognized and bound by the transcription factor II H (TFIIH) complex, but the DNA around the lesion will not be unwound.\n\nB. The distortion in the DNA helix caused by the pyrimidine dimer will not be recognized, and as a result, the subsequent steps of the repair pathway will not be initiated.\n\nC. The pyrimidine dimer will be recognized and the DNA will be unwound, but the damaged strand will not be incised because the XPC protein itself is the endonuclease responsible for cutting the DNA.\n\nD. The UvrA and UvrB proteins will bind to the pyrimidine dimer, but the repair process will halt because the cells lack the UvrC nuclease.\n\nE. The pyrimidine dimer will be directly reversed by a photolyase enzyme, a process that is independent of the XPC protein.", "solution": "We first recall the distinct roles of the human nucleotide excision repair (NER) subpathways. In global genome NER (GG-NER), helix-distorting lesions such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers are recognized in any genomic region by the XPC complex (XPC with hHR23B and CETN2). In transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER), damage in actively transcribed strands is recognized when RNA polymerase II stalls, with initiation mediated by CSA and CSB rather than XPC. After initial lesion recognition, both subpathways converge by recruiting TFIIH (containing XPB and XPD helicases) to unwind DNA around the lesion, followed by verification (XPA, RPA) and dual incision by XPF-ERCC1 (on the `$5'$` side) and XPG (on the `$3'$` side), gap filling by DNA polymerases, and ligation.\n\nGiven a loss-of-function mutation in XPC:\n1) In GG-NER, the initial recognition of helix-distorting lesions is defective, so the distortion caused by a pyrimidine dimer will not be efficiently recognized, and downstream steps (TFIIH recruitment, unwinding, incision, repair synthesis) will not be initiated.\n2) The scenario specifies cells are not undergoing DNA replication; this excludes replication-coupled processes but does not, by itself, ensure active transcription at the lesion. In the absence of ongoing transcription through the lesion, TC-NER would not initiate, leaving the lesion unrecognized in the XPC-deficient GG-NER context.\n3) Evaluate each option:\n- Option A is incorrect because TFIIH-dependent unwinding requires prior damage recognition and recruitment; moreover, TFIIH does unwind DNA once recruited.\n- Option B correctly states that without functional XPC in the GG-NER context, the helix distortion will not be recognized and subsequent repair steps will not initiate.\n- Option C is incorrect because XPC is not the endonuclease; the dual incisions are made by XPF-ERCC1 and XPG.\n- Option D is incorrect because UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC are bacterial NER proteins and are not involved in human NER.\n- Option E is incorrect because human cells lack photolyase-mediated photoreactivation; direct reversal by photolyase does not occur in humans.\n\nTherefore, the immediate fate of a pyrimidine dimer in these XPC-deficient human cells, in the GG-NER context, is failure of lesion recognition and failure to initiate repair, as stated in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1506424"}, {"introduction": "Once a DNA lesion is recognized, the repair machinery must gain access to the damaged strand. This requires actively unwinding the stable DNA double helix, a process driven by the molecular motor TFIIH, which functions as a helicase. This exercise challenges you to think like a biochemist, using a hypothetical scenario with a special ATP analog, `$ATP-\\gamma-S$`, to determine the precise step at which the NER pathway stalls when its energy supply is cut off [@problem_id:2327179].", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) pathway is a critical mechanism for removing bulky DNA adducts and lesions, such as those caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The process involves a cascade of protein complexes that recognize the lesion, unwind the DNA, excise the damaged segment, and synthesize a new, correct strand. A key multi-protein complex in this pathway is the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH), which possesses two DNA helicase subunits, XPB and XPD. These helicases are essential for locally unwinding the DNA around the lesion to form an open \"bubble,\" a step that requires the hydrolysis of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nConsider an in-vitro experiment where a segment of double-stranded DNA containing a single, well-defined bulky lesion is mixed with a complete set of purified human proteins required for NER. However, instead of normal ATP, the reaction mixture is supplied with `$ATP-\\gamma-S$`, a non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP. This analog can bind to the ATP-binding sites of enzymes but cannot be broken down to release energy.\n\nWhich of the following descriptions most accurately portrays the specific molecular state and protein composition of the complex that would be expected to stably accumulate at the site of the DNA lesion under these experimental conditions?\n\nA. A complex of XPC, TFIIH, XPA, and RPA assembled on an open DNA bubble of approximately 25 nucleotides, poised for incision.\n\nB. A complex of XPC and TFIIH bound to the damaged DNA, which remains in a closed, double-stranded conformation.\n\nC.

A complex containing DNA polymerase $\\delta$ and the sliding clamp PCNA, positioned at a gap in the DNA where the lesion has been removed.", "solution": "The Nucleotide Excision Repair pathway proceeds through ordered steps:\n1) Damage recognition: In global genome NER, the XPC-RAD23B (with CETN2) complex recognizes the bulky lesion on duplex DNA. This binding is ATP-independent.\n2) TFIIH recruitment: XPC recruits TFIIH to the damaged site through protein-protein interactions; this assembly does not require ATP hydrolysis.\n3) DNA opening and damage verification: TFIIH uses its XPB and XPD helicase/translocase activities to unwind DNA around the lesion and verify the damaged strand. Both XPB and XPD require ATP hydrolysis to drive strand separation and to form the open repair bubble.\n4) Stabilization and pre-incision complex formation: XPA and RPA are recruited to the single-stranded bubble to stabilize the open DNA and position the structure-specific endonucleases XPF-ERCC1 and XPG.\n5) Dual incision and repair synthesis: XPF-ERCC1 and XPG excise a 24–32 nucleotide segment, after which DNA polymerase and PCNA perform gap filling, followed by ligation.\n\nUnder the experimental condition where ATP is replaced by `$ATP-\\gamma-S$`:\n- `$ATP-\\gamma-S$` binds ATP-binding sites but cannot be hydrolyzed, so it prevents the helicase/translocase activities of XPB and XPD that require ATP hydrolysis.\n- Recruitment of TFIIH by XPC is not blocked by the absence of ATP hydrolysis; thus XPC and TFIIH can still assemble at the lesion.\n- Because ATP hydrolysis is blocked, TFIIH cannot unwind the DNA; therefore, the DNA remains in a closed, double-stranded conformation with no open bubble.\n- Without an open bubble, XPA and RPA do not stably assemble; incision by XPF-ERCC1 and XPG does not occur; no excised oligonucleotide is generated; and downstream gap filling by DNA polymerase and PCNA does not take place.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: an open bubble of approximately 25 nucleotides and stable recruitment of XPA and RPA require ATP hydrolysis by TFIIH helicases, which is blocked by `$ATP-\\gamma-S$`.\n- B is correct: XPC and TFIIH can assemble on the damaged site, but the DNA remains closed due to the inability to hydrolyze ATP and unwind.\n- C is incorrect: excision of the 24–32 nucleotide fragment requires prior bubble formation and endonuclease action, which will not occur.\n- D is incorrect: TFIIH recruitment is not blocked by `$ATP-\\gamma-S$`; the analog impairs helicase activity, not the protein-protein recruitment step.\n- E is incorrect: DNA polymerase $\\delta$ and PCNA act after excision; no gap is generated without prior incision.\n\nTherefore, the molecular state that accumulates is a complex of XPC and TFIIH at the lesion on closed duplex DNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2327179"}, {"introduction": "The \"excision\" in Nucleotide Excision Repair is performed by two highly specialized molecular scissors, the endonucleases XPF-ERCC1 and XPG. These enzymes don't cut randomly; they make precise incisions on either side of the DNA lesion to remove the damaged segment. This problem puts you in the role of a molecular biologist, challenging you to predict the exact size of DNA fragments produced in a laboratory assay, based on the specific cutting rules of these two key enzymes [@problem_id:1506440].", "problem": "In an in vitro biochemistry experiment designed to study Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), you are provided with a synthetic DNA substrate that mimics the open complex formed around a DNA lesion. The substrate consists of two DNA strands, each 90 nucleotides (nt) in length. The \"top\" strand is radiolabeled exclusively at its `$5'$` end. This top strand is annealed to a complementary \"bottom\" strand, except for a central region where the strands are non-complementary, forming a single-stranded \"bubble\". The bubble on the top strand spans from nucleotide position 41 to position 65, inclusive (nucleotides are numbered 1 to 90 from the `$5'$` end to the `$3'$` end).\n\nYou incubate this substrate in two separate reactions: one with purified human XPF-ERCC1 endonuclease and another with purified human XPG endonuclease. Based on prior structural and functional studies, the specific cleavage activities of these enzymes on this type of substrate are known:\n\n1.  **XPF-ERCC1**: This complex makes a single phosphodiester bond incision on the damaged strand at the `$5'$` side of the bubble. The cut occurs at the phosphodiester bond immediately to the `$5'$` side of the nucleotide located 4 bases upstream (towards the `$5'$` end) from the first nucleotide of the single-stranded bubble.\n2.  **XPG**: This enzyme makes a single phosphodiester bond incision on the damaged strand at the `$3'$` side of the bubble. The cut occurs at the phosphodiester bond immediately to the `$3'$` side of the nucleotide located 6 bases downstream (towards the `$3'$` end) from the last nucleotide of the single-stranded bubble.\n\nAfter incubation, the reaction products are analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which separates DNA fragments based on their length. Determine the expected lengths, in nucleotides, of the `$5'$-radiolabeled fragments generated in each of the two reactions.

We need to analyze each enzyme's action separately.\n\nThe substrate is a 90-nucleotide (nt) long DNA strand, labeled at its `$5'$` end. Nucleotides are numbered 1 to 90 from the `$5'$` end to the `$3'$` end. The single-stranded bubble extends from nucleotide 41 to 65.\n\nThis means:\n- The `$5'$` double-stranded region is from nucleotide 1 to 40.\n- The single-stranded bubble region is from nucleotide 41 to 65.\n- The `$3'$` double-stranded region is from nucleotide 66 to 90.\n\nA phosphodiester bond \"to the `$5'$` side\" of nucleotide `n` is the bond between nucleotide `n-1` and `n`.

A cut at this bond on a `$5'$-labeled strand will release a fragment of length `n`.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the fragment size from the XPF-ERCC1 reaction.**\n\nThe rule for XPF-ERCC1 is that it cuts at the phosphodiester bond immediately to the `$5'$` side of a specific target nucleotide. This target nucleotide is 4 bases upstream (towards the `$5'$` end) from the first nucleotide of the bubble.\n\n1.  The first nucleotide of the bubble is at position 41.\n2.  Moving 4 bases upstream from position 41 means moving to a smaller nucleotide number. The position of the target nucleotide is $41 - 4 = 37$.\n3.  The enzyme cleaves the phosphodiester bond immediately to the `$5'$` side of this target nucleotide (position 37). This is the bond between nucleotide 36 and nucleotide 37.\n4.  A cut at the bond between nucleotides 36 and 37 will sever the strand into two pieces. Since the strand is labeled at the `$5'$` end (at position 1), the resulting radiolabeled fragment will contain nucleotides 1 through 36.\n5.  Therefore, the length of the radiolabeled fragment produced by XPF-ERCC1 is 36 nucleotides.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the fragment size from the XPG reaction.**\n\nThe rule for XPG is that it cuts at the phosphodiester bond immediately to the `$3'$` side of a specific target nucleotide. This target nucleotide is 6 bases downstream (towards the `$3'$` end) from the last nucleotide of the bubble.\n\n1.  The last nucleotide of the bubble is at position 65.\n2.  Moving 6 bases downstream from position 65 means moving to a larger nucleotide number. The position of the target nucleotide is $65 + 6 = 71$.\n3.  The enzyme cleaves the phosphodiester bond immediately to the `$3'$` side of this target nucleotide (position 71). This is the bond between nucleotide 71 and nucleotide 72.\n4.  A cut at the bond between nucleotides 71 and 72 will sever the strand into two pieces. The `$5'$-labeled fragment will contain all nucleotides from the `$5'$` end up to the point of cleavage. This fragment will contain nucleotides 1 through 71.\n5.  Therefore, the length of the radiolabeled fragment produced by XPG is 71 nucleotides.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results.**\n\nThe problem asks for the lengths of the fragments from the XPF-ERCC1 reaction and the XPG reaction, respectively.\n- Length from XPF-ERCC1 reaction = 36 nt.\n- Length from XPG reaction = 71 nt.\n\nThe final answer should be presented as a pair (36, 71).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 36 & 71 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1506440"}]}
