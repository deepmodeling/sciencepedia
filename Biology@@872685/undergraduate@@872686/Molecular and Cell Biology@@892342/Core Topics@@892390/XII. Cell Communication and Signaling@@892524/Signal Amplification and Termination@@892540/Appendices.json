By calculating the total output from a single initial event, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the logic of signal amplification.", "problem": "In a simplified model of a cellular signaling pathway, a three-tier kinase cascade is initiated by the activation of a single receptor. This single activation event at time $t=0$ leads to the immediate activation of one molecule of a protein known as Kinase A.\n\nThe cascade proceeds as follows:\n1.  An activated molecule of Kinase A can phosphorylate and activate molecules of Kinase B. Each activated Kinase A molecule does so at a constant rate of $k_B$ molecules of Kinase B per second.\n2.  An activated molecule of Kinase B can, in turn, phosphorylate and activate molecules of Kinase C. Each activated Kinase B molecule does so at a constant rate of $k_C$ molecules of Kinase C per second.\n\nAll activated kinases (A, B, and C) are subject to deactivation by phosphatases. For simplicity, we assume that any activated kinase molecule has a constant probability of being deactivated, described by a single deactivation rate constant, $\\lambda$, with units of $s^{-1}$. This means that the average lifetime of any single activated kinase molecule is $1/\\lambda$.\n\nAssuming an unlimited supply of inactive Kinase A, B, and C molecules, derive an expression for the total number of activated molecules of Kinase C, $N_{C,\\text{total}}$, generated over the entire duration of the signaling event, in terms of $k_B$, $k_C$, and $\\lambda$.", "solution": "Let $A(t)$, $B(t)$, and $C(t)$ denote the expected numbers of activated Kinase A, B, and C molecules at time $t$. A single molecule of Kinase A is activated at $t=0$, so $A(0)=1$, and initially $B(0)=0$, $C(0)=0$.\n\nEach activated kinase deactivates with rate constant $\\lambda$, so the expected number of active Kinase A molecules satisfies\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt}=-\\lambda A,\\quad A(0)=1,\n$$\nwhose solution is\n$$\nA(t)=\\exp(-\\lambda t).\n$$\n\nActivated Kinase A produces activated Kinase B at rate $k_{B}$ per active A, while B deactivates at rate $\\lambda$.

This problem explores the fundamental mechanism of signal termination in G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways, one of the largest and most diverse families of signaling proteins [@problem_id:2338151]. By considering a hypothetical scenario with a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, a tool commonly used in molecular biology research, you will uncover why the intrinsic GTPase activity of G-proteins is an essential \"off switch\" for the cell.", "problem": "In a typical G-protein signaling pathway, a hormone binds to a G-protein-coupled receptor, causing the associated heterotrimeric G-protein to release its bound Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) and bind a molecule of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP). This binding activates the G-protein, which then modulates the activity of an effector enzyme. The signal is naturally terminated when the G-protein's intrinsic GTPase activity hydrolyzes GTP back to GDP, rendering the G-protein inactive.\n\nConsider an experimental study on isolated hepatocytes (liver cells) that respond to the hormone glucagon. The glucagon signal transduction pathway involves the activation of a G-protein that stimulates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. Activated adenylyl cyclase produces the second messenger cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP), which in turn activates Protein Kinase A (PKA) to initiate a cascade leading to glycogen breakdown.\n\nIn this experiment, the hepatocytes are treated with a brief pulse of glucagon to initiate signaling. Simultaneously, the cells are supplied with a high concentration of Guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP-gamma-S), a synthetic analog of GTP. A key feature of GTP-gamma-S is that it can bind to G-proteins in the same manner as GTP, but it is resistant to hydrolysis by the G-protein's intrinsic GTPase activity.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the state of the glucagon signaling pathway within these cells a short time after the initial stimulus?\n\nA. The G-protein will be unable to bind to the glucagon receptor, preventing any signal initiation from occurring.\n\nB. The G-protein will become constitutively active, leading to a sustained and high-level production of cAMP.\n\nC. The adenylyl cyclase enzyme will be continuously inhibited, causing a rapid decrease in intracellular cAMP levels below the basal state.\n\nD. The concentration of intracellular cAMP will oscillate, as the cell attempts to counteract the effect of the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog.\n\nE. The G-protein will fail to dissociate from its beta and gamma subunits after binding GTP-gamma-S, thus preventing the activation of adenylyl cyclase.", "solution": "Glucagon binds its G-protein-coupled receptor, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. This catalyzes the release of GDP from the heterotrimeric G protein and promotes binding of GTP to the $G_{\\alpha s}$ subunit. The GTP-bound $G_{\\alpha s}$ dissociates from $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ and activates adenylyl cyclase, increasing the conversion of ATP to cAMP. Under normal conditions, the intrinsic GTPase activity of $G_{\\alpha s}$ hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, which terminates signaling by allowing reassociation with $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$ and cessation of adenylyl cyclase stimulation.\n\nIn the presence of GTP-gamma-S, which binds in place of GTP but is resistant to hydrolysis by the intrinsic GTPase of $G_{\\alpha s}$, the termination step (GTP to GDP hydrolysis) is blocked. Therefore, once $G_{\\alpha s}$ binds GTP-gamma-S, it remains locked in the active, GTP-bound conformation and stays dissociated from $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$. As a result, adenylyl cyclase remains persistently stimulated, so cAMP production continues at a high rate. Although phosphodiesterases degrade cAMP, sustained production by continuously active adenylyl cyclase drives intracellular cAMP to remain elevated above basal levels a short time after stimulation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because receptor-G protein coupling and nucleotide exchange still occur; GTP-gamma-S does not prevent receptor coupling.\n- B is correct because non-hydrolyzable binding locks $G_{\\alpha s}$ in the active state, producing sustained, high cAMP.\n- C is incorrect because $G_{\\alpha s}$ stimulates, not inhibits, adenylyl cyclase.\n- D is incorrect because there is no mechanism here to induce oscillations; the dominant effect is persistent activation.\n- E is incorrect because GTP-bound $G_{\\alpha s}$ normally dissociates from $G_{\\beta\\gamma}$; non-hydrolyzability does not prevent this dissociation.\n\nThus, the glucagon signaling pathway will be constitutively active downstream of the G protein, leading to sustained and high-level production of cAMP.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2338151"}, {"introduction": "Having explored amplification and termination separately, this final practice integrates these concepts into a single, comprehensive cycle.

Consider a single, complete cycle of signaling initiated by the binding of one ligand molecule to one GPCR, followed by all necessary termination steps to return the system to its pre-stimulus basal state. The process follows the specific steps and stoichiometry outlined below.\n\n1.  **G-protein Activation**: The single activated GPCR acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, activating $N_G = 120$ heterotrimeric G-proteins. Each activation event involves the exchange of a bound guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) on the G-protein $\\alpha$-subunit.\n\n2.  **Second Messenger Production**: Each of the $N_G$ activated G-protein $\\alpha$-subunits binds to and activates one molecule of adenylyl cyclase. Each activated adenylyl cyclase enzyme synthesizes $N_{cAMP} = 250$ molecules of cAMP from adenosine triphosphate (ATP).\n\n3.  **Kinase Activation**: The cell contains a pool of inactive Protein Kinase A (PKA) holoenzymes. Each PKA holoenzyme is a tetramer, which dissociates into two active catalytic subunits and a regulatory dimer upon the cooperative binding of four molecules of cAMP.\n\n4.  **Downstream Effects**: Each released active PKA catalytic subunit phosphorylates $N_P = 80$ distinct target proteins. Each phosphorylation reaction consumes one molecule of ATP.\n\n5.  **Signal Termination**:\n    *   To terminate the signal at the receptor level, a G-protein coupled receptor kinase (GRK) phosphorylates the activated GPCR at $N_{phos} = 4$ distinct sites, a process that prepares the receptor for arrestin binding and internalization. Each phosphorylation by GRK consumes one molecule of ATP.\n    *   Each of the $N_G$ active G-protein $\\alpha$-subunits intrinsically hydrolyzes its bound GTP to GDP, thus inactivating itself.\n    *   All cAMP molecules generated are hydrolyzed to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) by phosphodiesterases.\n    *   All proteins phosphorylated by PKA are eventually dephosphorylated by cellular phosphatases. The hydrolysis of cAMP and the dephosphorylation of proteins do not consume ATP or GTP.\n\nAssuming the cell has a sufficient supply of all necessary components (ATP, GTP, enzymes, substrates), calculate the total number of ATP molecules and GTP molecules consumed for this single, complete signaling and termination cycle.
