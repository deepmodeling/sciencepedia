This first practice challenges you to apply your knowledge of the JAK-STAT sequence by considering the effect of a specific inhibitor [@problem_id:2342451]. By determining where a JAK kinase inhibitor breaks the chain of communication, you will solidify your understanding of which steps depend on phosphorylation versus simple protein-protein binding.", "problem": "The Janus Kinase-Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway is a crucial signaling cascade used by cells to respond to extracellular signals like cytokines and growth factors, playing a key role in immunity, cell growth, and differentiation. The canonical pathway proceeds through a series of well-defined steps:\n\n1.  A cytokine binds to its specific transmembrane receptor.\n2.  This binding event induces the dimerization or oligomerization of receptor subunits.\n3.  The receptor-associated JAK proteins are brought into close proximity, leading to their activation through trans-phosphorylation.\n4.  The activated JAKs phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues on the intracellular tails of the receptors.\n5.  These newly created phosphotyrosine sites serve as docking sites for the recruitment of cytosolic STAT proteins.\n6.  Once docked, the STAT proteins are themselves phosphorylated by the activated JAKs.\n7.  Phosphorylated STATs dissociate from the receptor, form stable dimers, and translocate into the cell nucleus.\n8.  Inside the nucleus, STAT dimers bind to specific DNA sequences in the promoter regions of target genes, thereby regulating their transcription.\n\nA cell biologist is investigating an inflammatory response mediated by a specific cytokine in a culture of human immune cells. To test the necessity of the JAK-STAT pathway, the biologist adds a potent and highly specific small-molecule inhibitor to the cell culture. This inhibitor is designed to bind to the ATP-binding pocket of JAKs, thus blocking their catalytic (kinase) activity, but it does not interfere with protein-protein interactions.\n\nIf the cytokine is added to the cells after they have been treated with this JAK inhibitor, at which of the following steps would the signaling cascade be most immediately and directly blocked?\n\nA. The binding of the cytokine to its cell surface receptor.\n\nB. The dimerization of the cytokine receptor subunits.\n\nC. The phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the cytokine receptor.\n\nD. The translocation of STAT dimers from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.\n\nE. The binding of STAT dimers to target gene promoters in the nucleus.", "solution": "The inhibitor is described as a potent, specific blocker of the ATP-binding pocket of JAKs, eliminating their catalytic (kinase) activity while not perturbing protein-protein interactions. The core biochemical principle is that kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation requires ATP binding to the kinase active site; occupying this pocket prevents phosphate transfer to substrates. In the canonical JAK-STAT pathway, the steps that require JAK catalytic activity are phosphorylation events: first, JAKs phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the receptor cytoplasmic tails, creating phosphotyrosine docking sites for STATs; subsequently, JAKs phosphorylate STATs themselves once docked.\n\nBecause the inhibitor does not affect protein-protein interactions, cytokine binding to its receptor and receptor subunit dimerization remain intact. Likewise, mere juxtaposition of receptor-associated JAKs via receptor dimerization still occurs, but their activation via trans-phosphorylation is a kinase reaction that requires ATP and thus is prevented by the inhibitor. Among the listed options, the earliest step that is most immediately and directly dependent on JAK kinase activity is the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the receptor. Without this phosphorylation, STATs cannot dock, cannot be phosphorylated, and thus will not dimerize, translocate, or bind DNA; however, all those later failures are downstream consequences. Therefore, the first directly blocked step in the provided list is the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the cytokine receptor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2342451"}, {"introduction": "Signal transduction relies on precise molecular recognition, often mediated by specialized protein domains. This exercise zooms in on the STAT protein, asking you to predict the consequences of a dysfunctional Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain [@problem_id:2342438]. Solving this problem requires understanding that the SH2 domain acts as a specific \"docking\" module, and its failure reveals the critical importance of targeted protein-protein interactions for transmitting a signal from the cell membrane to the nucleus.", "problem": "The Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway is a critical signaling cascade used by cells to respond to extracellular signals like cytokines and growth factors. The general mechanism involves the binding of a ligand to a transmembrane receptor, which causes the receptor to dimerize. This brings the associated, but non-covalently bound, JAK proteins into close proximity, allowing them to phosphorylate each other (autophosphorylation) and then phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor. These newly created phosphotyrosine sites serve as docking points for downstream signaling proteins.\n\nConsider a scenario in a cell line where a specific mutation has been introduced into the gene encoding a particular STAT protein. This mutation completely inactivates the function of the STAT protein's Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain but leaves the rest of the protein structure, including its C-terminal transactivation domain and DNA-binding domain, intact. All other components of the pathway, including the cytokine receptor and the JAK protein, are wild-type and fully functional. When these cells are stimulated with the appropriate cytokine, what is the most immediate molecular event that is blocked, thereby preventing the subsequent activation and function of the mutant STAT protein?\n\nA. The dimerization of two STAT proteins.\n\nB. The phosphorylation of the JAK proteins.\n\nC. The translocation of the STAT protein into the nucleus.\n\nD. The binding of the STAT protein to the phosphorylated receptor.\n\nE. The binding of the cytokine to its cell surface receptor.", "solution": "The canonical JAK-STAT sequence is as follows: a cytokine binds its receptor, the receptor dimerizes, the associated JAK kinases are brought into proximity and undergo trans-autophosphorylation, and then JAKs phosphorylate specific tyrosines on the receptor cytoplasmic tails, generating phosphotyrosine docking sites. STAT proteins are recruited to these sites by their SH2 domains, enabling JAKs to phosphorylate STAT on a critical tyrosine. Phosphorylated STATs then dimerize via reciprocal SH2–phosphotyrosine interactions, translocate to the nucleus, bind DNA via their DNA-binding domains, and activate transcription via their transactivation domains.\n\nIn the described mutant, only the SH2 domain of the STAT protein is inactivated; all other domains of STAT and all upstream components (cytokine, receptor, JAK) are wild-type and functional. Therefore, cytokine binding to the receptor, receptor dimerization, JAK activation and autophosphorylation, and phosphorylation of receptor tyrosines all proceed normally.\n\nThe first step that requires the STAT SH2 domain is the docking of STAT to the phosphorylated receptor tail. Without a functional SH2 domain, the STAT cannot bind to these phosphotyrosine sites. Consequently, subsequent steps that depend on this recruitment—STAT phosphorylation by JAK, STAT dimerization, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activation—are all secondarily blocked. Among the provided choices, the most immediate molecular event that is blocked is the binding of the STAT protein to the phosphorylated receptor.\n\nThus, the correct option is D. For completeness: A (dimerization) occurs later and requires prior STAT phosphorylation; B (JAK phosphorylation) occurs upstream and is unaffected; C (nuclear translocation) requires prior dimerization; E (cytokine binding) is the initiating event and is unaffected.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2342438"}, {"introduction": "A key skill for a molecular biologist is not only understanding how a pathway works but also how to measure its activity.
