{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding how cells interact with their environment is fundamental to cell biology. This first practice explores the specific molecular handshake between cells and the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin. By simulating an experiment with a competitive inhibitor, you will see how a small, soluble peptide containing the critical RGD sequence can be used to disrupt cell adhesion, illustrating the principle of receptor-ligand competition in a tangible way [@problem_id:2310218].", "problem": "In a cell biology experiment, a researcher coats the surface of a plastic culture dish with fibronectin, a key protein of the Extracellular Matrix (ECM). Fibronectin contains a specific amino acid sequence, Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD), which is recognized by integrin receptors on the surface of animal cells. This interaction is crucial for cell adhesion, allowing cells to attach to the ECM.\n\nThe researcher then seeds fibroblasts, a type of cell that expresses integrin receptors, onto the fibronectin-coated dish. After giving the cells a short time to begin adhering, the researcher adds a high concentration of a small, soluble synthetic peptide, whose sequence consists only of the RGD motif, to the cell culture medium.\n\nAssuming all other conditions are optimal for cell adhesion, what is the most likely immediate effect of adding this soluble RGD peptide on the fibroblasts' ability to adhere to the fibronectin-coated dish?\n\nA. Cell adhesion will be enhanced because the RGD peptide activates the integrin receptors.\n\nB. Cell adhesion will be inhibited because the soluble peptide will compete with the immobilized fibronectin for binding to the integrin receptors.\n\nC. There will be no effect on cell adhesion because the peptide is soluble and not part of a larger protein structure.\n\nD. Cell adhesion will be inhibited because the soluble peptide will bind to and block the RGD sites on the fibronectin-coated surface.\n\nE. Cell adhesion will be enhanced because the peptide will create cross-links between the cells and the fibronectin on the dish.", "solution": "1. Identify the specific receptor-ligand interaction: Integrin receptors on fibroblasts recognize and bind the RGD motif present within fibronectin. This binding to immobilized fibronectin on the dish promotes integrin clustering, formation of focal adhesions, and stable cell adhesion.\n\n2. Define the experimental manipulation: The researcher adds a high concentration of a small, soluble peptide consisting solely of the RGD motif to the medium. This peptide presents the same integrin-binding determinant as fibronectin but is not immobilized and lacks additional domains required for multivalent engagement and downstream adhesion strengthening.\n\n3. Apply receptor-ligand competition principles: Because both immobilized fibronectin and the soluble RGD peptide contain the same binding motif for integrins, they compete for the same binding site on the integrin extracellular domain. By the law of mass action, a high concentration of the soluble ligand will occupy a substantial fraction of integrin binding sites.\n\n4. Infer functional consequence of soluble ligand binding: When integrins are occupied by soluble RGD, they are prevented from binding to the immobilized fibronectin on the surface. Soluble RGD cannot provide the mechanical resistance, spatial organization, or multivalency required for integrin clustering and force transmission, so it does not support adhesion; instead, it blocks productive binding to the ECM.\n\n5. Immediate experimental outcome: The net effect is a rapid inhibition of cell adhesion due to competitive inhibition of integrin-fibronectin interactions by the soluble RGD peptide.\n\n6. Evaluate alternatives:\n- A is incorrect: Binding of a monovalent soluble peptide does not enhance adhesion; it prevents productive engagement with immobilized ligand and does not promote the necessary integrin clustering.\n- C is incorrect: Solubility does not preclude biological activity; soluble RGD peptides are classic integrin inhibitors.\n- D is incorrect: The soluble peptide does not bind fibronectin’s RGD sites; it mimics them and binds integrins.\n- E is incorrect: A small monovalent peptide cannot cross-link integrins to fibronectin; it lacks multivalency and immobilization.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is competitive inhibition of adhesion by the soluble RGD peptide.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2310218"}, {"introduction": "Now that we've examined a key cell-matrix attachment point, let's turn to how the matrix itself is constructed. This exercise focuses on the biosynthesis of type I collagen, the primary structural protein in many tissues. You will predict the outcome of blocking a crucial extracellular processing step, linking a specific enzymatic inhibition to its effect on the final architecture of the matrix and reinforcing the idea that protein function is determined by a precise assembly pathway [@problem_id:2310214].", "problem": "A research team is investigating the formation of connective tissue by culturing human fibroblasts, which are known to produce and secrete components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), primarily type I collagen. To study the assembly process, they treat the culture with a novel, highly specific small-molecule inhibitor. This inhibitor irreversibly blocks the enzymatic activity of procollagen C-proteinase (also known as bone morphogenetic protein 1, BMP-1). In the normal pathway, this enzyme is secreted and functions exclusively in the extracellular space to cleave the C-terminal propeptide from the procollagen molecule.\n\nAfter allowing the treated cells to synthesize and secrete new ECM components for 24 hours, the culture is prepared for analysis by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), a technique that allows for high-resolution imaging of cellular and extracellular structures.\n\nGiven your understanding of collagen biosynthesis and assembly, which of the following statements best describes the most likely observation of the newly formed ECM in the TEM images?\n\nA. The extracellular space will be filled with randomly oriented, soluble procollagen molecules or loose, non-fibrillar aggregates, lacking the typical 67-nm periodic banding pattern.\n\nB. Secretory vesicles within the fibroblasts will become massively engorged with procollagen, as the cleavage of the propeptide is a required signal for exocytosis.\n\nC. The collagen fibrils that do form will be exceptionally thick and densely packed, as the retained C-propeptides act as nucleation sites that promote excessive lateral aggregation.\n\nD. The matrix will appear structurally normal, but its ability to connect to cell surfaces via fibronectin and integrins will be completely abolished.\n\nE. The newly synthesized collagen will form a delicate, web-like network characteristic of collagen type IV found in basal laminae, instead of the typical fibrillar structure.", "solution": "Collagen type I biosynthesis proceeds as follows: fibroblasts synthesize preprocollagen, which, after removal of the signal peptide in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, becomes procollagen containing N-terminal and C-terminal propeptides. These propeptides maintain solubility and prevent intracellular fibril formation. Post-translational modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues and glycosylation; procollagen chains assemble into a triple helix and are secreted as procollagen into the extracellular space.\n\nIn the extracellular compartment, specific proteinases remove the propeptides: the N-propeptide is cleaved by procollagen N-proteinase (e.g., ADAMTS-2), and the C-propeptide is cleaved by procollagen C-proteinase (BMP-1). Removal of both propeptides generates tropocollagen, which spontaneously self-assembles into striated fibrils exhibiting the characteristic D-periodicity banding (approximately 67 nm) and subsequently undergoes covalent cross-linking mediated by lysyl oxidase to achieve tensile strength.\n\nIn this experiment, BMP-1 activity is irreversibly inhibited. Because BMP-1 functions extracellularly, secretion of procollagen from fibroblasts proceeds normally; exocytosis does not require prior propeptide cleavage. However, without C-propeptide removal, procollagen cannot convert to mature tropocollagen. The retained C-propeptides sterically and electrostatically hinder lateral assembly into fibrils, thereby blocking formation of the typical striated fibrils with D-periodic banding. As a result, the extracellular space accumulates soluble procollagen molecules and possibly loose, non-fibrillar or poorly organized aggregates that lack the characteristic banding pattern detectable by Transmission Electron Microscopy.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A aligns with the predicted outcome: absence of mature fibrils and D-periodic banding, with accumulation of soluble or loosely aggregated procollagen.\n- Option B is incorrect because cleavage is extracellular and not required for exocytosis; secretory vesicles will not be engorged due to this inhibition.\n- Option C is incorrect because the retained C-propeptides inhibit, rather than promote, fibril nucleation and lateral aggregation.\n- Option D is incorrect because blocking BMP-1 does not specifically abolish fibronectin-integrin interactions; the matrix would not appear structurally normal and would primarily lack proper fibrils.\n- Option E is incorrect because the collagen type produced remains type I; inhibition of BMP-1 does not convert fibrillar collagen into a type IV network.\n\nTherefore, the most likely TEM observation is described by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2310214"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice integrates the concepts of cell attachment and matrix structure into a single experimental design. Here, you will analyze hypothetical data to test the hypothesis that fibronectin acts as a molecular bridge, connecting fibroblasts to a collagen substrate. This quantitative problem challenges you to interpret the results of an experiment using domain-specific blocking antibodies, a powerful technique for dissecting the function of multi-domain proteins in complex biological systems [@problem_id:2310181].", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the mechanism of fibroblast attachment to a substrate coated with Type I collagen. The central hypothesis is that fibroblasts require an intermediary protein, fibronectin, which they secrete and use as a molecular bridge to bind to the collagen matrix. To test this, an experiment is conducted using specific blocking antibodies.\n\nThe experiment is set up in four identical culture wells, each coated with purified Type I collagen. An initial population of $2.00 \\times 10^5$ fibroblasts is added to each well. The wells contain a serum-free medium supplemented with one of the following reagents:\n\n*   **Well 1 (Positive Control):** No additional reagent. Fibroblasts are expected to secrete their own fibronectin and attach.\n*   **Well 2 (Isotype Control):** A non-specific Control Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, added at the same concentration as the blocking antibodies. This controls for any non-specific effects of adding a large protein molecule to the culture.\n*   **Well 3 (Anti-Cell-Binding Domain):** A blocking antibody, `Ab-CBD`, that specifically binds to the cell-binding domain on fibronectin, preventing it from interacting with the fibroblast's cell-surface receptors.\n*   **Well 4 (Anti-Collagen-Binding Domain):** A blocking antibody, `Ab-CollBD`, that specifically binds to the collagen-binding domain on fibronectin, preventing it from anchoring to the collagen substrate.\n\nAfter a 90-minute incubation period, the wells are gently washed to remove all non-adherent cells. The number of fibroblasts remaining attached to the bottom of each well is then carefully counted. The results are as follows:\n\n*   Number of attached cells in Well 1: $N_1 = 1.56 \\times 10^5$\n*   Number of attached cells in Well 2: $N_2 = 1.54 \\times 10^5$\n*   Number of attached cells in Well 3: $N_3 = 2.20 \\times 10^4$\n*   Number of attached cells in Well 4: $N_4 = 3.60 \\times 10^4$\n\nThe effectiveness of a blocking antibody can be quantified by the number of cell attachments it prevents, a value we will call the \"inhibited attachment count\".
