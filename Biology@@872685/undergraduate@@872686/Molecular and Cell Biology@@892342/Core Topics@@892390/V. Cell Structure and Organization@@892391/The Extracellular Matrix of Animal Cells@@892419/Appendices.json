This first practice challenges you to think like a cell biologist by designing a foundational experiment to test whether a cell line requires the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin to attach to a surface. By comparing outcomes on different substrates, you will learn to interpret experimental data to support or refute a specific biological hypothesis [@problem_id:2341874].", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating a newly isolated animal cell line, designated \"Cell-Y\", to understand its requirements for adhesion. The researcher hypothesizes that Cell-Y depends on the glycoprotein fibronectin, a major component of the Extracellular Matrix (ECM), for attachment and spreading. To test this hypothesis, the biologist prepares an experiment. Two types of sterile plastic culture dishes are used. Dish A is an untreated standard tissue culture dish. Dish B is an identical dish that has been pre-coated with a solution of purified fibronectin, allowed to adsorb to the surface, and then rinsed to remove any unbound protein. Equal numbers of Cell-Y are seeded into both Dish A and Dish B, in identical culture media. The dishes are incubated for several hours under standard conditions, after which the cells are observed using a phase-contrast microscope.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes would provide the strongest evidence to support the hypothesis that Cell-Y requires fibronectin for adhesion and spreading?\n\nA. In both Dish A and Dish B, the majority of cells are firmly attached to the surface and have a flattened, spread-out morphology.\n\nB. In Dish A, cells are firmly attached and spread out, while in Dish B, the majority of cells are floating in the medium and have a rounded morphology.\n\nC. In both Dish A and Dish B, the majority of cells are floating in the medium and have a rounded morphology.\n\nD. In Dish A, the majority of cells are floating in the medium and have a rounded morphology, while in Dish B, cells are firmly attached and have a flattened, spread-out morphology.\n\nE. In both Dish A and Dish B, the majority of cells undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) and detach from the surface.", "solution": "We restate the hypothesis: Cell-Y requires fibronectin, an ECM glycoprotein, as a substrate ligand for integrin-mediated adhesion and subsequent spreading. Therefore, if fibronectin is necessary, then providing fibronectin on the surface should permit adhesion and spreading, whereas its absence should lead to poor adhesion, with cells remaining rounded and often floating.\n\nExperimental setup: Dish A is untreated plastic, expected to lack specifically presented fibronectin. Dish B is coated with purified fibronectin and rinsed, so the surface should present fibronectin to which fibronectin-binding integrins can adhere. Equal numbers of cells in identical medium and conditions ensure that any difference in adhesion and morphology is attributable to the presence or absence of fibronectin on the surface.\n\nPredicted outcome if the hypothesis is correct: On Dish B (fibronectin-coated), cells should adhere strongly and spread (flattened morphology), indicating integrin-fibronectin binding and downstream cytoskeletal engagement. On Dish A (untreated), cells should fail to adhere robustly, remaining rounded and frequently floating, reflecting the lack of the required ligand.\n\nEvaluation of the provided outcomes:\n- Option A: Both dishes show firm attachment and spreading. This does not support a requirement for fibronectin because adhesion occurs without fibronectin coating, implying that Cell-Y can adhere via other ligands or nonspecific mechanisms.\n- Option B: Dish A adherent and spread, Dish B rounded and floating. This contradicts the hypothesis, as fibronectin coating should not reduce adhesion if fibronectin is required.\n- Option C: Both dishes show rounded, floating cells. This neither supports nor refutes the specific requirement for fibronectin; it suggests either poor cell viability or absence of required conditions on both dishes.\n- Option D: Dish A rounded and floating, Dish B adherent and spread. This matches the prediction under the hypothesis, providing strong, positive evidence that fibronectin is necessary for adhesion and spreading.\n- Option E: Both dishes undergo apoptosis and detach. This indicates a viability issue and does not test the adhesion requirement, thus does not support the hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the outcome that provides the strongest evidence for the hypothesis is the one where cells preferentially adhere and spread only on the fibronectin-coated surface while failing to do so on the untreated surface, which corresponds to Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2341874"}, {"introduction": "Once we establish that a cell requires a protein like fibronectin for adhesion, the next question is *how* it recognizes that protein. This exercise explores the molecular basis of this interaction by introducing a competitive inhibitor—a small peptide mimicking the Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD) binding site found on fibronectin. Your task is to predict how this soluble competitor will affect the ability of cells to bind to a fibronectin-coated surface, illustrating a powerful method for dissecting molecular recognition pathways [@problem_id:2341852].", "problem": "A cell biology researcher is investigating the mechanisms of cell adhesion. The experimental system consists of a culture of fibroblast cells, which are known to express integrin receptors on their plasma membrane, and a set of polystyrene culture dishes. The surface of these dishes has been coated with purified fibronectin, a major protein component of the Extracellular Matrix (ECM). In a control experiment, the fibroblasts are plated onto the fibronectin-coated dish, and they adhere and spread out as expected.\n\nFor the main experiment, the researcher prepares a solution containing a high concentration of a small, synthetic, soluble peptide. The amino acid sequence of this peptide is simply Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD). This RGD-containing solution is added to the cell culture medium just before the fibroblasts are plated onto the fibronectin-coated dish.\n\nAssuming the an RGD sequence is the primary recognition site for the relevant integrin-fibronectin interaction and the added peptide is stable in the culture medium, which of the following outcomes is the most likely immediate effect of adding the soluble RGD peptide?\n\nA. Cell adhesion to the dish will be significantly inhibited.\n\nB. Cell adhesion to the dish will be significantly enhanced.\n\nC. Cell adhesion will be unaffected because the cells will secrete their own ECM components.\n\nD. The cells will increase their expression of integrin receptors to compensate.\n\nE. The fibronectin on the dish will be denatured by the peptide.", "solution": "We identify the molecular interaction: fibroblast integrins bind fibronectin primarily via the RGD recognition motif on fibronectin. Let $I$ denote integrin receptors on the cell surface, $F$ the immobilized fibronectin on the dish, and $P$ the soluble RGD peptide added to the medium. The key assumption given is that the RGD sequence is the primary recognition site for the relevant integrin–fibronectin interaction and that the peptide is stable in the medium.\n\nBy mass action, the relevant equilibria are:\n$$\nI + F \\rightleftharpoons IF \\quad \\text{with } K_{d,F}=\\frac{[I][F]}{[IF]},\n$$\n$$\nI + P \\rightleftharpoons IP \\quad \\text{with } K_{d,P}=\\frac{[I][P]}{[IP]}.\n$$\nBecause $P$ contains the same RGD motif recognized by the integrin, $P$ competes with $F$ for the same binding site on $I$. The fraction of integrins occupied by fibronectin under competitive conditions is given by the standard competitive binding expression:\n$$\n\\theta_{F}=\\frac{\\frac{[F]}{K_{d,F}}}{1+\\frac{[F]}{K_{d,F}}+\\frac{[P]}{K_{d,P}}}.\n$$\nAs the concentration $[P]$ is increased to a high level, the term $\\frac{[P]}{K_{d,P}}$ becomes large, thereby reducing $\\theta_{F}$. This directly lowers the formation of $IF$ complexes, which are required for adhesion and spreading on the fibronectin-coated surface. Thus, the immediate effect is a significant inhibition of cell adhesion.\n\nConsidering alternatives:\n- Enhancement of adhesion is inconsistent with competitive inhibition by a soluble ligand mimicking the binding epitope.\n- Secretion of endogenous ECM could eventually occur but will not prevent the immediate, competitive blockade, especially upon initial plating.\n- Upregulation of integrin expression is a longer-term transcriptional response and not an immediate effect of adding peptide.\n- Denaturation of fibronectin by a small RGD peptide is not expected; the peptide is not a denaturant and specifically competes for integrin binding.\n\nTherefore, the most likely immediate effect is significant inhibition of cell adhesion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2341852"}, {"introduction": "The extracellular matrix is a dynamic environment, constantly remodeled by the balanced action of enzymes that degrade it and inhibitors that control them.
