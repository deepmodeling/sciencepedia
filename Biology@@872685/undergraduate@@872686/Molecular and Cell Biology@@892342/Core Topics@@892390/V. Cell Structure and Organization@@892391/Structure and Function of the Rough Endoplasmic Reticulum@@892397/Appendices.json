The rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) serves as the entry point for the secretory pathway, and this entry is controlled by a specific \"address label\" on the protein itself. This first exercise challenges you to predict the consequences of removing this label, a fundamental thought experiment that clarifies the default state of protein synthesis and the critical role of signal sequences [@problem_id:2339416].", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the ultimate destination of a newly synthesized protein is dictated by specific amino acid sequences that act as sorting signals. A well-studied example is the pathway for proteins destined for secretion. This process begins with translation on a free ribosome in the cytoplasm. A special N-terminal signal sequence on the nascent polypeptide targets the ribosome-mRNA complex to the membrane of the rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). This allows the protein to be fed into the ER lumen as translation proceeds, marking its entry into the secretory pathway, which continues through the Golgi apparatus and ends with exocytosis from the cell.\n\nConsider a scenario in a cell biology laboratory where a gene encoding a typical secreted protein is genetically modified. The modification consists of the precise deletion of the codons corresponding to the protein's N-terminal signal sequence. The rest of the gene remains intact, and this altered gene is successfully transcribed and translated within the cell. Assuming this protein does not possess any other targeting signals for other organelles, what will be the final, predominant location of this modified protein?\n\nA. Secreted into the extracellular space\n\nB. Freely diffusing in the cytoplasm\n\nC. Embedded within the plasma membrane\n\nD. Accumulated in the nucleus\n\nE. Trapped within the lumen of the Golgi apparatus", "solution": "Translation of virtually all eukaryotic proteins initiates on free ribosomes in the cytosol. Proteins destined for the secretory pathway possess an N-terminal ER signal sequence that is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP). SRP binding pauses translation and targets the ribosome–nascent chain complex to the rough ER membrane, where translation resumes with co-translational translocation of the polypeptide into the ER lumen. From there, the protein proceeds through the Golgi and can be secreted, inserted into membranes, or targeted to endomembrane compartments.\n\nIf the codons encoding the N-terminal ER signal sequence are precisely deleted, SRP cannot recognize or bind the nascent polypeptide. Consequently, the ribosome remains free in the cytosol and translation proceeds entirely in the cytoplasm. Upon termination, the complete polypeptide is released into the cytosol.\n\nIn the absence of any other targeting signals (e.g., no nuclear localization signal, no mitochondrial targeting sequence, no peroxisomal targeting signal, no internal signal-anchor for membranes), the default localization of a polypeptide is the cytosol. Therefore, the predominant location of the modified protein will be the cytoplasm.\n\nBy elimination of the options:\n- It cannot be secreted (A) or accumulate in the Golgi (E) because it never enters the ER.\n- It will not be embedded in the plasma membrane (C) because membrane insertion for secretory/membrane proteins requires ER targeting and often signal-anchor sequences.\n- It will not accumulate in the nucleus (D) without an explicit nuclear localization signal.\nThus, the correct choice is freely diffusing in the cytoplasm (B).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2339416"}, {"introduction": "Not all proteins pass completely into the RER; many are embedded within its membrane, where they perform essential functions. This practice moves beyond soluble proteins to explore the biogenesis of these vital transmembrane proteins. By comparing two different types of membrane anchors, you will learn to apply predictive principles, like the \"positive-inside rule,\" that govern how proteins are precisely woven into the lipid bilayer [@problem_id:2339455].", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the biogenesis of two newly discovered single-pass transmembrane proteins, Protein X and Protein Y, which are both destined for the membrane of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). The cytosol and the ER lumen represent the two distinct compartments separated by the ER membrane. The targeting signals for these proteins are characterized as follows:\n\n- **Protein X**: This protein is targeted co-translationally. It possesses a single, internal, non-cleavable hydrophobic sequence that acts as a signal-anchor. Biochemical analysis reveals that the cluster of amino acids immediately N-terminal to this hydrophobic sequence carries a significantly greater net positive charge than the cluster of amino acids C-terminal to it.\n\n- **Protein Y**: This protein is fully synthesized on free ribosomes in the cytosol before targeting. It is a tail-anchored protein, meaning its single hydrophobic membrane anchor sequence is located at its extreme C-terminus. This C-terminal location prevents recognition by the co-translational machinery, and it is instead inserted into the ER membrane post-translationally by a specialized pathway.\n\nBased on the established mechanisms of protein translocation into the ER, which of the following statements accurately describes the final topological orientation of both mature proteins within the ER membrane?\n\nA. Protein X: N-terminus in the cytosol, C-terminus in the ER lumen. Protein Y: N-terminus in the cytosol, C-terminus in the ER lumen.\n\nB.

Both proteins have opposite orientations: one has its N-terminus in the cytosol while the other has its N-terminus in the ER lumen.", "solution": "We apply the established topogenic principles for ER membrane protein insertion.\n\nFor Protein X:\n- It has a single internal, non-cleavable hydrophobic signal-anchor sequence used co-translationally with the Sec61 translocon.\n- The orientation of such internal signal-anchor sequences is governed by the positive-inside rule: the side of the transmembrane segment with the higher net positive charge remains on the cytosolic side.\n- The problem states that residues immediately N-terminal to the hydrophobic segment carry a greater net positive charge than those C-terminal to it. Therefore, the N-terminal side is retained in the cytosol, and the C-terminal side is translocated into the ER lumen.\n- Conclusion for Protein X: N-terminus in cytosol, C-terminus in ER lumen (the classic Type II topology).\n\nFor Protein Y:\n- It is a tail-anchored protein with a single hydrophobic anchor at the extreme C-terminus, synthesized fully in the cytosol and inserted post-translationally via the GET/TRC pathway.\n- Tail-anchored proteins generally insert so that the long N-terminal domain remains in the cytosol, while the very short sequence C-terminal to the transmembrane helix ends up in the ER lumen. This is consistent with the positive-inside rule, as positive charges are typically enriched N-terminal to the transmembrane segment, favoring a cytosolic N-terminus.\n- Conclusion for Protein Y: N-terminus in cytosol, C-terminus in ER lumen.\n\nTherefore, both Protein X and Protein Y have the orientation: N-terminus in the cytosol and C-terminus in the ER lumen, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2339455"}, {"introduction": "The RER is far more than a simple translocation channel; it is a sophisticated quality control checkpoint that ensures the integrity of the proteome. This final problem delves into the RER's elegant quality control mechanism, the calnexin cycle, which relies on modifications to sugar chains attached to newly made proteins. By analyzing a hypothetical enzymatic defect, you will gain insight into how the cell monitors protein folding and maintains the health of the entire secretory pathway [@problem_id:2339430].", "problem": "In the quality control system for glycoprotein folding within the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the calnexin cycle plays a crucial role. A newly synthesized polypeptide is typically co-translationally modified by the attachment of a pre-formed oligosaccharide with the structure `$Glc_3Man_9GlcNAc_2$`. Sequential trimming of glucose residues by glucosidase I and glucosidase II generates a monoglucosylated glycan (`$Glc_1Man_9GlcNAc_2$`), which serves as the recognition signal for the lectin-like chaperone calnexin. Binding to calnexin facilitates proper folding. For the protein to be released from calnexin and assessed for correct folding, this final glucose residue must be removed by glucosidase II. If the protein is found to be misfolded, the enzyme UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) can add a glucose back, allowing the protein to re-bind calnexin for another folding attempt.\n\nConsider a mutant cell line where the gene encoding glucosidase II has a specific point mutation. This mutation renders the enzyme capable of its first catalytic action (removing the second glucose from the initial `$Glc_3$` glycan to produce the monoglucosylated form) but completely inhibits its second catalytic action (removing the final, innermost glucose from the monoglucosylated glycan).\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary consequence of this specific mutation on the calnexin folding cycle for a newly synthesized glycoprotein in this cell line?\n\nA. The glycoprotein will bind to calnexin but will be permanently trapped in the complex, arresting the folding and quality control cycle.\n\nB. The glycoprotein will be unable to bind to calnexin in the first place, causing it to aggregate in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen.\n\nC. The glycoprotein will cycle through calnexin binding and release much faster than normal, leading to the export of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nD. The glycoprotein, once bound to calnexin, will be immediately released and recognized as misfolded by UGGT, causing it to enter a futile cycle of re-glucosylation and re-binding.\n\nE. The glycoprotein will be correctly deglucosylated but will fail to be recognized by calnexin, bypassing the quality control cycle entirely.", "solution": "The core quality-control logic is as follows:\n1) A pre-formed N-linked glycan $Glc_3Man_9GlcNAc_2$ is transferred to the polypeptide. Glucosidase I removes the outermost glucose to give $Glc_2Man_9GlcNAc_2$.\n2) Glucosidase II removes the next glucose to generate the monoglucosylated glycan $Glc_1Man_9GlcNAc_2$, which is the specific ligand for calnexin. Calnexin binding facilitates folding.\n3) For release from calnexin, glucosidase II must remove the final glucose, converting $Glc_1Man_9GlcNAc_2$ to $Man_9GlcNAc_2$. If the protein is misfolded, UGGT adds back a single glucose to $Man_9GlcNAc_2$, regenerating $Glc_1Man_9GlcNAc_2$ to re-enter the calnexin cycle.\n\nGiven the mutation: glucosidase II retains only its first catalytic step (removing the second glucose from $Glc_3$ to form $Glc_1Man_9GlcNAc_2$) but cannot perform its second step (removing the final, innermost glucose from the monoglucosylated glycan). Therefore:\n- The glycoprotein reaches the monoglucosylated state $Glc_1Man_9GlcNAc_2$ and binds calnexin normally.\n- It cannot be deglucosylated to $Man_9GlcNAc_2$, so it cannot be released from calnexin.\n- Without release, the substrate does not present the deglucosylated form required for UGGT recognition; thus, re-glucosylation cycling cannot proceed.\n- The primary consequence is persistent trapping in the calnexin complex, arresting the folding/quality-control cycle.\n\nThis outcome corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2339430"}]}
