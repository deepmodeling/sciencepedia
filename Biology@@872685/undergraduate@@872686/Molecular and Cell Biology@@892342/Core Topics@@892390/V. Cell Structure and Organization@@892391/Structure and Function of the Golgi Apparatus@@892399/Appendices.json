This thought experiment simulates a classic \"pulse-chase\" study, a powerful technique used by cell biologists to track molecules over time. By using a temperature-sensitive fluorescent protein, we can create a synchronized wave of cargo leaving the Endoplasmic Reticulum and ask a simple but fundamental question: where does it go first? [@problem_id:2339256]", "problem": "A cell biology research group is investigating the dynamics of protein transport through the secretory pathway. They have engineered a cell line to express a special fusion protein: a temperature-sensitive mutant of the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus glycoprotein (ts-VSV-G) tagged with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP).\n\nThis ts-VSV-G protein has a specific property:\n- At a high, \"restrictive\" temperature of 40°C, the protein misfolds and is retained by the quality control machinery within the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER).\n- At a lower, \"permissive\" temperature of 32°C, the protein folds correctly, allowing it to exit the ER and proceed through the secretory pathway.\n\nThe experiment is conducted as follows:\n1. The cells are incubated at the restrictive temperature (40°C) for several hours to cause a large accumulation of the ts-VSV-G-GFP protein throughout the ER network.\n2. At time $t=0$, the cell culture medium is replaced with fresh medium containing cycloheximide (a drug that halts all new protein synthesis), and the temperature is simultaneously shifted to the permissive temperature (32°C). This initiates a synchronized \"pulse\" of pre-existing, fluorescently-tagged protein transport.\n\nBased on the established model of anterograde (forward) protein transport, which of the following describes the most likely predominant subcellular localization of the GFP signal at a short time point after the shift, specifically at $t = 7$ minutes?\n\nA. Evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm.\n\nB. Concentrated at the trans-face of the Golgi apparatus and in secretory vesicles budding from it.\n\nC. Remaining entirely within the Endoplasmic Reticulum.\n\nD. Primarily localized to the cis-face of the Golgi apparatus.\n\nE. Accumulated on the exterior of the plasma membrane.", "solution": "We apply the established sequence of anterograde transport in the secretory pathway: properly folded secretory membrane proteins exit the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) in COPII-coated carriers at ER exit sites, then traverse the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) to reach the cis-face of the Golgi apparatus, subsequently progressing through medial and trans cisternae to the trans-Golgi network and finally to secretory vesicles and the plasma membrane.\n\nGiven the properties of the engineered protein and the experimental design:\n1. At the restrictive temperature, the ts-VSV-G-GFP misfolds and is retained within the ER by quality control, causing accumulation throughout the ER.\n2. At $t=0$, the shift to the permissive temperature allows the accumulated pool to fold correctly. Cycloheximide simultaneously halts new protein synthesis, ensuring that only the pre-existing pool proceeds; this does not prevent trafficking of the existing pool.\n3. After permissive folding, export from the ER begins rapidly as COPII vesicles bud from ER exit sites. This early stage occurs within minutes and leads to delivery to the ERGIC and then the cis-Golgi.\n4. Progression to the trans-face of the Golgi and formation of secretory vesicles budding from it occurs later, typically on the order of tens of minutes after ER exit. Arrival at the plasma membrane occurs still later.\n5. Therefore, at an early time point such as $t=7$ minutes, the predominant localization is expected to be at early Golgi entry compartments: ERGIC and the cis-face of the Golgi. It would not yet be concentrated at the trans-face or the plasma membrane, and it would not remain entirely in the ER because exit initiates promptly upon folding. It would also not be evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm because trafficking is along defined membrane-bound compartments.\n\nAmong the provided options, the description that best matches the expected predominant localization at $t=7$ minutes is the cis-face of the Golgi apparatus.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2339256"}, {"introduction": "The function of the Golgi as a protein modification \"assembly line\" is inseparable from its unique structure as a stack of flattened sacs, or cisternae. But what holds this stack together? This exercise delves into the architectural underpinnings of the Golgi, focusing on the role of specific proteins that act as a molecular \"glue.\" By considering a hypothetical scenario where this glue is missing, you can deduce the importance of stacking for the Golgi's overall function [@problem_id:2339277].", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is investigating a newly discovered eukaryotic microbe. This organism demonstrates a peculiar defect: while it successfully synthesizes proteins at the ribosome and modifies them within the endoplasmic reticulum, it is unable to perform the complex, sequential glycosylation steps required for many of its secreted proteins. Genetic analysis reveals a loss-of-function mutation in a gene encoding a protein homologous to the mammalian Golgi Reassembly Stacking Protein 65 (GRASP65), a key component known to be involved in the architecture of the Golgi apparatus.\n\nBased on the known function of GRASP proteins in maintaining Golgi structure, which of the following observations would you most likely expect to see when examining the cell's ultrastructure using transmission electron microscopy?\n\nA. The Golgi apparatus appears as a normal stack of cisternae, but each cisterna is significantly swollen and dilated.\n\nB. The Golgi apparatus completely disassembles into a dispersed cloud of small transport vesicles, with no discernible cisternal structures.\n\nC. The entire Golgi apparatus appears to have collapsed and fused back into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nD. The Golgi stack is intact and morphologically normal, but it is mislocalized to the cell periphery instead of its typical perinuclear region.\n\nE. Individual Golgi cisternae are still present, but they are no longer organized into stacks and are instead scattered throughout the perinuclear cytoplasm.", "solution": "We identify the key cellular function implicated: GRASP65 (and GRASP55) are Golgi matrix proteins that mediate the stacking of Golgi cisternae by trans-oligomerization across adjacent cisternal membranes, maintaining the architecture of the Golgi stack. A loss-of-function mutation in a GRASP protein would primarily disrupt cisternal stacking rather than cause global vesiculation, ER fusion, or mislocalization driven by cytoskeletal interactions.\n\nGiven the phenotype described—normal protein synthesis and ER processing but failure in complex, sequential glycosylation—this is consistent with a loss of ordered passage of cargo through sequential cis-, medial-, and trans-Golgi compartments, which requires properly stacked cisternae. Thus, we expect the structural defect to be specific to stacking.\n\nWe evaluate the options:\n- Option A (swollen, dilated cisternae with normal stacking) suggests secretory traffic block or osmotic/ion imbalance causing cisternal distension, not a stacking defect. This does not match the known role of GRASP proteins.\n- Option B (complete disassembly into small vesicles) is characteristic of disruptions in COPI/ARF1 function or mitotic disassembly, not specific GRASP loss, which typically leaves cisternae present but unstacked.\n- Option C (collapse into the ER) corresponds to brefeldin A or ARF1 GEF inhibition, causing Golgi membranes to fuse with the ER, not a GRASP-specific phenotype.\n- Option D (intact stack mislocalized to the periphery) is characteristic of microtubule or dynein disruption (e.g., nocodazole), not GRASP function.\n- Option E (individual cisternae present but unstacked and scattered) matches the canonical phenotype of GRASP depletion: cisternae persist but are no longer organized into stacks, leading to dispersed unstacked cisternae in the perinuclear region and consequent impairment of sequential glycosylation.\n\nTherefore, the most likely ultrastructural observation is unstacked, scattered cisternae with the loss of organized Golgi stacks.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2339277"}, {"introduction": "After proteins are processed and modified as they travel through the Golgi stack, they arrive at the trans-Golgi network, which acts as the cell's main sorting and distribution hub. This exercise explores one of the most critical sorting pathways: the delivery of powerful digestive enzymes to the lysosome. By examining the consequence of a failure in the molecular addressing system—the mannose-6-phosphate tag—you will uncover the default fate of proteins that lack a specific destination signal [@problem_id:2339292].", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the sorting of proteins to their correct destinations is a highly regulated process. The journey for newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases begins in the endoplasmic reticulum and continues through the Golgi apparatus. In the cis-Golgi network, a specific molecular tag is added to these enzymes to ensure they are ultimately delivered to the lysosome. This tag is a Mannose-6-Phosphate (M6P) group. The creation of this tag is a two-step enzymatic process.\n\nConsider a hypothetical cell line derived from a patient with a rare genetic disorder. In this cell line, the enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase, which catalyzes the first of the two steps required to generate the M6P tag, is completely non-functional due to a mutation.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary consequence of this enzymatic defect on the cell's lysosomes?\n\nA. The hydrolytic enzymes will fail to be recognized in the trans-Golgi network, causing them to be packaged into secretory vesicles and released into the extracellular space, leaving lysosomes devoid of their essential enzymes.\n\nB. The hydrolytic enzymes will be correctly synthesized but will accumulate within the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, causing it to swell and eventually triggering apoptosis.\n\nC. The untagged hydrolytic enzymes will be recognized as misfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum and will be retro-translocated into the cytoplasm for degradation by the proteasome.\n\nD. The lysosomes will form and function normally for digesting internal cellular components (autophagy), but they will be unable to fuse with endosomes to degrade materials brought in from outside the cell.\n\nE. The untagged hydrolytic enzymes will be randomly and incorrectly incorporated into other organelles, such as mitochondria and peroxisomes, disrupting their functions.", "solution": "Newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases enter the endoplasmic reticulum, acquire N-linked oligosaccharides, and move to the cis-Golgi network. The specific tag that directs them to lysosomes is mannose-6-phosphate (M6P), generated by a two-step process: first, N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase transfers N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to mannose residues on the hydrolase’s N-linked oligosaccharide (forming a phosphodiester); second, an uncovering enzyme removes the N-acetylglucosamine to expose the M6P. In the trans-Golgi network, M6P receptors bind the M6P-tagged enzymes, packaging them into clathrin-coated vesicles destined for endosomes and ultimately lysosomes.\n\nIf N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase is non-functional, the first step fails and no M6P is generated. Without M6P, hydrolases cannot bind M6P receptors in the trans-Golgi network. In the absence of specific retention or sorting signals, these correctly folded hydrolases follow the default constitutive secretory pathway and are packaged into secretory vesicles and released extracellularly. Consequently, lysosomes are deprived of their essential acid hydrolases, leading to a functional deficiency of lysosomal degradation—classically seen in I-cell (mucolipidosis II) disease.\n\nEvaluating the options:\nA is correct: lack of M6P prevents recognition in the trans-Golgi network; enzymes are secreted, leaving lysosomes without hydrolases.\nB is incorrect: the enzymes do not accumulate in the Golgi; they are secreted by default.\nC is incorrect: the proteins are properly folded; the defect is in tagging, not folding, so ER-associated degradation is not triggered.\nD is incorrect: the primary defect is loss of hydrolases, not a fusion defect; both autophagy and endocytosed cargo degradation are impaired because enzymes are missing.\nE is incorrect: organelle targeting is signal-dependent; without appropriate targeting sequences for mitochondria or peroxisomes, the default fate is secretion, not random misincorporation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2339292"}]}
