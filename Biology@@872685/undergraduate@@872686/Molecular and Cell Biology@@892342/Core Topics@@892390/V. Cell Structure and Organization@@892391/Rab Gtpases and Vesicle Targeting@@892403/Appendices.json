This first exercise explores the crucial activation step of the Rab cycle by introducing a \"dominant negative\" mutant protein. By predicting the outcome of this hypothetical scenario, you will gain insight into how these molecular switches are turned on and why regulatory proteins like Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs) can be a bottleneck in a cellular pathway.", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating a vesicular transport pathway regulated by a small GTPase named Rab-Z. They create a mutant version of Rab-Z, denoted Rab-Z(mut), which is permanently locked in its Guanine Diphosphate (GDP)-bound state and cannot be converted to the active Guanine Triphosphate (GTP)-bound form. When Rab-Z(mut) is overexpressed in cells that also produce the normal, wild-type Rab-Z, the transport pathway is strongly inhibited. This phenomenon is known as a dominant negative effect.\n\nThe function of Rab proteins is controlled by two key regulatory proteins: Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs), which activate Rab proteins by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP, and GTPase-Activating Proteins (GAPs), which inactivate Rab proteins by stimulating GTP hydrolysis.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate molecular explanation for the dominant negative inhibition caused by Rab-Z(mut)?\n\nA. The Rab-Z(mut) protein directly binds to and sequesters the cargo molecules intended for transport, preventing them from being loaded into vesicles.\n\nB. The Rab-Z(mut) protein competitively binds to the specific GTPase-Activating Protein (GAP) for Rab-Z, preventing the inactivation of any wild-type Rab-Z that happens to become active.\n\nC. The Rab-Z(mut) protein competitively binds to and sequesters the specific Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) for Rab-Z, preventing the activation of the wild-type Rab-Z protein.\n\nD. The Rab-Z(mut) protein is misfolded and aggregates, forming large intracellular protein clumps that physically obstruct the movement of vesicles.\n\nE. The Rab-Z(mut) protein outcompetes the wild-type Rab-Z for binding to effector proteins on the target membrane, thus blocking vesicle fusion.", "solution": "1) Identify the regulatory cycle of Rab proteins: Rab proteins alternate between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. Activation requires a Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) to promote GDP release and GTP loading. Inactivation is accelerated by a GTPase-Activating Protein (GAP), which stimulates GTP hydrolysis back to GDP.\n\n2) Describe the mutant: Rab-Z(mut) is locked in the GDP-bound state and cannot be converted to the GTP-bound form. Therefore, it cannot carry out active, effector-binding functions characteristic of GTP-bound Rab.\n\n3) Define dominant negative logic: A dominant negative mutant inhibits the function of the wild-type protein by interfering with a shared, limiting regulatory component or interaction partner that is required for wild-type activity.\n\n4) Apply to Rab regulatory interactions: A well-established mechanism for dominant negative small GTPases (e.g., Ras, Rho, Rab) is that GDP-locked (or nucleotide-free-favoring) mutants bind tightly to their specific GEFs. Because the mutant cannot proceed to the GTP-bound state, it effectively sequesters the GEF, reducing GEF availability for the wild-type protein.\n\n5) Predict consequence: Sequestration of the specific GEF by Rab-Z(mut) prevents efficient GDP-GTP exchange on wild-type Rab-Z, thereby lowering the pool of active, GTP-bound wild-type Rab-Z and inhibiting the transport pathway.\n\n6) Exclude alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because Rab proteins do not directly bind and sequester cargo; cargo loading is mediated by coat/adaptor complexes, not by GDP-bound Rab.\n- B is incorrect because GAPs act on the GTP-bound form to stimulate inactivation; competitive binding to GAP would, if anything, reduce inactivation, and GDP-locked Rab is not the relevant substrate for GAP.\n- D is incorrect because dominant negative effects are specific molecular interferences, not nonspecific aggregation-based obstruction.\n- E is incorrect because effector binding generally requires the GTP-bound form; a GDP-locked Rab would not outcompete wild-type for effector binding.\n\n7) Therefore, the most accurate molecular explanation is that the GDP-locked Rab-Z(mut) sequesters the specific GEF, preventing activation of wild-type Rab-Z.\n\nConclusion: Option C is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2334847"}, {"introduction": "Once a Rab GTPase is activated by a GEF, its primary job is to recruit other proteins, known as effectors, to perform the task of vesicle targeting. This practice focuses on that critical hand-off from the Rab protein to its downstream effector. We will investigate a scenario where this connection is severed to better understand the specific role of tethering factors in bridging the gap between a transport vesicle and its correct destination membrane.", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the transport of proteins to their correct destination is mediated by transport vesicles. This process is tightly regulated by a family of small proteins called Rab GTPases. When a Rab protein on a vesicle surface is bound to Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP), it is in its active state and can recruit specific effector proteins. One class of Rab effectors, known as tethering factors, is responsible for establishing the initial, long-range connection between a transport vesicle and its target membrane, a crucial step before the vesicle can dock and fuse.\n\nConsider a cell line engineered with a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding a specific tethering factor. This mutation completely abolishes the ability of the tethering factor to bind to its corresponding active Rab-GTP on the surface of vesicles budding from the trans-Golgi network, which are destined for the plasma membrane. All other cellular machinery, including vesicle formation and Rab protein activation, remains functional. In these mutant cells, where would you expect the vesicles carrying secretory proteins to predominantly accumulate?\n\nA. Fused indiscriminately with various organelles within the cell.\n\nB. Freely dispersed in the cytoplasm, unable to associate with the plasma membrane.\n\nC. Trapped within the cisternae of the trans-Golgi network, unable to bud off.\n\nD. Immediately targeted to and degraded within the lysosomes.\n\nE. Docked tightly at the plasma membrane, but unable to fuse.", "solution": "Rab GTPases in their GTP-bound state recruit specific effector proteins, including tethering factors, to mediate the initial, long-range capture of transport vesicles at the correct target membrane. Tethering precedes and enables subsequent docking (mediated by SNARE pairing and associated factors) and fusion.\n\nGiven the mutation abolishes binding between the specific tethering factor and its corresponding active Rab-GTP on vesicles from the trans-Golgi network destined for the plasma membrane, the immediate consequence is loss of the initial capture step at the plasma membrane. All other machinery, including vesicle budding from the trans-Golgi network and Rab activation, is intact, so vesicles will form and be transported.\n\nBecause tethering is specifically required before docking, the vesicles will not be able to dock tightly at the plasma membrane; thus option E (docked but unable to fuse) is inconsistent, as that defect would reflect impaired fusion machinery (e.g., SNARE or fusion regulators), not tethering. They will not be trapped in the trans-Golgi network (option C), since budding is unaffected. They will not fuse indiscriminately (option A), because fusion requires correct docking and SNARE specificity, which is not bypassed by loss of tethering. They are also not targeted to lysosomes for degradation (option D), as that would require recognition and sorting into the endolysosomal pathway, which is not implied by the loss of tethering.\n\nTherefore, lacking tethering to the plasma membrane, the vesicles will predominantly remain in the cytoplasm without being captured by the target membrane, effectively accumulating as freely dispersed vesicles unable to associate productively with the plasma membrane.\n\nThe correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2334864"}, {"introduction": "A biological cycle is only sustainable if its components can be reset and recycled. The final step in a Rab protein's journey involves inactivation, ensuring the protein is available for another round of transport. This problem presents a classic thought experiment with a \"constitutively active\" mutant—one that is permanently stuck in the \"on\" state—to reveal why turning the signal off is just as critical for the transport process as turning it on.", "problem": "In a cell biology experiment, researchers are investigating the vesicular transport pathway that delivers newly synthesized proteins from the Trans-Golgi Network (TGN) to the plasma membrane for secretion. This specific pathway relies on a particular Rab GTPase, which we will call RabS (for Secretion). The normal function of RabS involves cycling between an inactive, Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP)-bound state and an active, Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP)-bound state. In its active GTP-bound form, RabS on the vesicle surface binds to tethering proteins on the inner face of the plasma membrane, facilitating vesicle docking and subsequent fusion.\n\nThe researchers engineer a cell line to express a mutant form of RabS. This mutant, RabS-mut, has a single amino acid substitution that completely abolishes its ability to hydrolyze GTP, even in the presence of its specific GTPase-Activating Protein (GAP). However, the mutation does not affect its ability to exchange GDP for GTP or to bind to its downstream effector proteins (tethering factors) when in the GTP-bound state.\n\nAssuming this mutant RabS-mut is expressed at levels comparable to the native RabS protein, what is the most direct and immediate consequence on the TGN-to-plasma membrane secretion pathway?\n\nA. Secretory vesicles will be unable to form and bud from the TGN.\n\nB. Secretory vesicles will form but will accumulate in the cytosol because they cannot bind to the motor proteins required for transport to the plasma membrane.\n\nC. Secretory vesicles will be transported to the plasma membrane but will be unable to dock, resulting in a buildup of undocked vesicles near the cell periphery.\n\nD. Secretory vesicles will successfully dock and fuse with the plasma membrane, but the RabS-mut protein and its associated tethering machinery will become irreversibly locked at the fusion site, preventing their reuse in subsequent transport cycles.\n\nE. The RabS-mut protein will be unable to bind to the membrane of newly formed secretory vesicles and will remain soluble and inactive in the cytosol.", "solution": "The problem asks for the primary consequence of introducing a mutant Rab GTPase (RabS-mut) that cannot hydrolyze its bound GTP. To solve this, we must understand the key steps of the Rab GTPase cycle and the role of GTP hydrolysis in this process.\n\n1.  **The Rab GTPase Cycle Overview:** Rab proteins act as molecular switches in vesicle trafficking. They cycle between an inactive, GDP-bound form, which is typically soluble in the cytosol (often complexed with a GDP-dissociation inhibitor, or GDI), and an active, GTP-bound form, which is associated with a membrane (either a vesicle or a target organelle).\n\n2.  **Activation and Function:** A Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) on the donor membrane (here, the TGN) catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on the Rab protein. This activation (Rab-GDP -> Rab-GTP) induces a conformational change that exposes a lipid anchor, causing the Rab protein to insert into the membrane of the budding vesicle. The active Rab-GTP on the vesicle surface then acts as a recognition marker. When the vesicle reaches its destination (the plasma membrane), the Rab-GTP binds to specific effector proteins, most notably tethering factors on the target membrane. This tethering event brings the vesicle close to the target, allowing for the interaction of v-SNAREs (on the vesicle) and t-SNAREs (on the target membrane), which ultimately drives membrane fusion.\n\n3.  **Inactivation and Recycling (The Crucial Step):** After vesicle fusion is complete, the Rab protein must be inactivated and recycled to be used for another round of transport. This inactivation is achieved through the hydrolysis of its bound GTP back to GDP (Rab-GTP -> Rab-GDP). This hydrolysis step is intrinsically slow for Rab proteins and is greatly accelerated by a GTPase-Activating Protein (GAP), which is typically located on the target membrane. The resulting inactive Rab-GDP protein changes conformation, loses its affinity for the membrane and its effectors, and is extracted from the membrane by a GDI, returning it to the cytosolic pool for reuse.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Mutant (RabS-mut):** The problem states that RabS-mut can be activated (exchange GDP for GTP) and can bind its effectors (tethering proteins) but cannot hydrolyze GTP. Let's trace its path:\n    *   RabS-mut will be activated to the GTP-bound state at the TGN and correctly incorporated into the membrane of a new secretory vesicle.\n    *   The vesicle, now studded with active RabS-mut-GTP, will be transported to the plasma membrane.\n    *   At the plasma membrane, the active RabS-mut-GTP will successfully bind to its tethering factors, leading to docking.\n    *   Docking will lead to SNARE-mediated fusion, and the vesicle will deliver its contents to the exterior of the cell.\n\n5.  **The Post-Fusion Consequence:** The critical failure occurs *after* fusion. Normally, the GAP at the plasma membrane would trigger GTP hydrolysis to inactivate RabS. However, RabS-mut is immune to this. It remains in its active, GTP-bound state, firmly attached to the plasma membrane and likely still bound to its tethering effector. It cannot be inactivated and cannot be extracted by GDI for recycling.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A: \"Secretory vesicles will be unable to form and bud from the TGN.\" This is incorrect. Rab activation and recruitment occur as part of, or just after, budding. The mutation doesn't prevent this initial step.\n    *   B: \"Secretory vesicles will form but will accumulate in the cytosol because they cannot bind to the motor proteins...\" This is incorrect. The primary role of Rab proteins is in tethering/docking, not directly binding motor proteins (though they can recruit proteins that do). The mutation creates a \"permanently on\" signal, which would not inhibit transport.\n    *   C: \"Secretory vesicles will be transported to the plasma membrane but will be unable to dock...\" This is the opposite of what would happen. The GTP-bound form is *required* for docking. Since the mutant is locked in this form, it will be very efficient at docking.\n    *   D: \"Secretory vesicles will successfully dock and fuse with the plasma membrane, but the RabS-mut protein and its associated tethering machinery will become irreversibly locked at the fusion site, preventing their reuse in subsequent transport cycles.\" This is the correct conclusion. The initial transport events will work, but the system cannot be reset. The essential RabS protein and its machinery will be sequestered at the plasma membrane, depleting the available pool and eventually halting the entire pathway.\n    *   E: \"The RabS-mut protein will be unable to bind to the membrane of newly formed secretory vesicles...\" This is incorrect. Binding to the membrane is a consequence of being in the active, GTP-bound state, which the mutant protein can achieve and maintain.\n\nTherefore, the most direct consequence is the successful fusion event followed by the failure of the system to reset, leading to the accumulation of the active Rab protein on the target membrane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2334849"}]}
