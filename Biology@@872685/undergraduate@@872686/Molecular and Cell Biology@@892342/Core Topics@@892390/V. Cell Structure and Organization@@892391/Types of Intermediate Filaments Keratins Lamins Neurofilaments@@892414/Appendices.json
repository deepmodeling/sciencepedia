{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Neurofilaments are the architectural backbone of axons, but unlike simpler polymers, they often require a specific mix of protein subunits to assemble correctly. This practice challenges you to think like a geneticist by predicting the cellular outcome when a key component, the neurofilament light chain (NF-L), is removed. By doing so, you will test the crucial concept of \"obligate heteropolymer\" assembly, a fundamental rule governing the structure of the neuronal cytoskeleton. [@problem_id:2346947]", "problem": "In vertebrate neurons, the axonal cytoskeleton is primarily composed of neurofilaments, a type of intermediate filament that plays a crucial role in providing structural support and defining axonal caliber. These neurofilaments are obligate heteropolymers assembled from three different subunit proteins: the neurofilament light chain (NF-L), the neurofilament medium chain (NF-M), and the neurofilament heavy chain (NF-H). The widely accepted model of assembly proposes that NF-L forms the central core of the 10 nm filament, while NF-M and NF-H co-assemble with NF-L and project their long C-terminal domains as \"side-arms\" that regulate inter-filament spacing.\n\nA research team has developed a transgenic mouse line in which the gene encoding the NF-L protein has been specifically knocked out. The genes for NF-M and NF-H remain intact and are expressed at normal levels. Based on the established role of NF-L as the core structural component, what is the most probable outcome for the neurofilament network within the axons of these genetically modified neurons?\n\nA. The axons will contain a normal density of neurofilaments, as NF-M and NF-H will self-assemble into functional filaments to compensate for the absence of NF-L.\n\nB. The axons will exhibit an increased density of neurofilaments because the smaller NF-M and NF-H filaments can pack more tightly without the NF-L core.\n\nC. The number of neurofilaments within the axons will be drastically reduced because NF-M and NF-H subunits fail to assemble into filaments and are largely retained within the neuronal cell body.\n\nD. The axons will contain neurofilaments that are packed much closer together than normal, as they will be composed only of NF-M and NF-H, which lack the bulky NF-L subunit.\n\nE. The neurofilament network will be completely replaced by an expanded network of microtubules, maintaining the axon's structural integrity and caliber without any significant pathology.", "solution": "Goal: Determine the most probable outcome for the axonal neurofilament network when NF-L, the core subunit of neurofilaments, is knocked out while NF-M and NF-H are expressed normally.\n\nStep 1: State the established assembly principle.\nNeurofilaments in vertebrate neurons are intermediate filaments formed as obligate heteropolymers. The canonical assembly model requires NF-L to form the central core of the 10 nm filament. NF-M and NF-H co-assemble with NF-L and contribute long C-terminal side-arms that regulate inter-filament spacing. Critically, NF-M and NF-H do not efficiently self-assemble into filaments in the absence of NF-L in vivo.\n\nStep 2: Apply the assembly pathway constraint.\nIntermediate filament assembly proceeds via coiled-coil dimer formation, antiparallel tetramers, unit-length filaments, and radial compaction to 10 nm filaments. In the neurofilament system, NF-L provides the essential scaffold for co-assembly; NF-M and NF-H require NF-L to form stable dimers/tetramers capable of further assembly. Without NF-L, the assembly pathway is aborted because NF-M and NF-H alone do not form stable, transport-competent filaments in neurons.\n\nStep 3: Apply axonal transport principles.\nNeurofilament subunits are conveyed to axons primarily as assembled polymers or competent precursors via slow axonal transport. Unassembled subunits, especially NF-M and NF-H lacking NF-L, are inefficiently transported and tend to be retained within the neuronal soma, where they may be degraded or form nonproductive aggregates. Therefore, axons in NF-L knockout neurons become largely devoid of neurofilaments.\n\nStep 4: Predict the axonal phenotype and exclude alternatives.\n- Option A is invalid because NF-M and NF-H do not self-assemble into functional neurofilaments in vivo without NF-L.\n- Option B is invalid because there is not an increase in filament density; instead, there is a profound loss of neurofilaments due to failed assembly and transport.\n- Option D is invalid for the same reason; axons will not contain filaments composed only of NF-M and NF-H.\n- Option E is invalid because microtubules do not fully replace neurofilament function in maintaining axonal caliber; typical findings include reduced axonal caliber and conduction abnormalities, not a normal structural phenotype.\n\nConclusion: The most probable outcome is a drastic reduction of neurofilaments in axons because NF-M and NF-H fail to assemble without NF-L and are retained in the neuronal cell body.

This exercise uses a classic microinjection thought experiment to explore this dynamism, asking you to contrast the fate of soluble building blocks (tetramers) versus fully formed filaments when introduced into a living cell. [@problem_id:2346946] Your analysis will reveal the fundamental mechanism of subunit exchange that allows keratin networks to be both stable and adaptable.", "problem": "An experiment is designed to investigate the dynamics of keratin, a type of intermediate filament, within a mature, polarized epithelial cell layer. These cells possess a well-established endogenous network of keratin filaments that provides structural support and is anchored to desmosomes (cell-cell junctions) and hemidesmosomes (cell-matrix junctions).\n\nTwo separate microinjection experiments are performed.\n- In Experiment 1, a solution containing fluorescently-labeled, soluble keratin tetramers is microinjected into the cytoplasm of a single epithelial cell.\n- In Experiment 2, a suspension containing fluorescently-labeled, fully pre-assembled keratin filaments is microinjected into the cytoplasm of an identical cell.\n\nAfter allowing sufficient time for the injected components to distribute and interact with the cellular machinery, the localization of the fluorescent signal is observed via microscopy. Which of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of these two experiments?\n\nA. In Experiment 1, the fluorescent signal will gradually incorporate into the endogenous filamentous network, showing clear localization at cell junctions. In Experiment 2, the fluorescent signal will appear as distinct, insoluble aggregates or bundles within the cytoplasm, failing to integrate into the endogenous network.\n\nB. In both experiments, the fluorescently-labeled components will successfully integrate into the endogenous keratin network, leading to a fluorescent signal that perfectly co-localizes with the existing filament system anchored at cell junctions.\n\nC. In Experiment 1, the injected tetramers will be rapidly degraded by the cell's quality control machinery, resulting in no significant fluorescent signal. In Experiment 2, the pre-assembled filaments will be recognized as structural elements and will correctly integrate into the endogenous network.\n\nD. In both experiments, the injected components will be recognized as foreign entities and targeted for degradation via autophagy, resulting in a diffuse, weak fluorescent signal localized to lysosomes and no incorporation into the cytoskeleton.\n\nE. In Experiment 1, the tetramers will assemble into a de novo network surrounding the nucleus, separate from the existing keratin system. In Experiment 2, the filaments will migrate to the cell periphery and align along the apical-basal axis, independent of cell junctions.", "solution": "We proceed by applying established principles of intermediate filament (IF) biology, keratin assembly dynamics, and prior microinjection and FRAP observations in epithelial cells.\n\n1. Structural and assembly properties of keratin IFs:\n- Keratin IFs are assembled from soluble subunits (coiled-coil dimers) that associate antiparallel into tetramers. Tetramers laterally and longitudinally assemble into unit-length filaments and mature filaments.\n- IFs are apolar and exhibit dynamic subunit exchange along the filament length rather than exclusively at ends (unlike actin and microtubules). This allows soluble pools of subunits to incorporate into pre-existing filaments distributed throughout the cytoplasm.\n- In polarized epithelial cells, keratin networks are physically connected to desmosomes and hemidesmosomes, which serve as anchoring sites that influence network organization and can nucleate or stabilize assembly locally. Therefore, newly incorporated keratin subunits are expected to show enrichment where the endogenous network is anchored at cell junctions.\n\n2. Predicted outcome for Experiment 1 (injected fluorescent soluble keratin tetramers):\n- The injected tetramers represent the physiological assembly-competent pool.\n- Given IF subunit exchange along filament length and templated assembly into the pre-existing network, the injected fluorescent tetramers will be captured and incorporated into endogenous keratin filaments.\n- Over time, fluorescence will co-localize with the existing network architecture and show clear localization at anchoring junctions (desmosomes and hemidesmosomes), reflecting normal network turnover and polymer capture.\n- Therefore, the fluorescent signal will become filamentous and junction-associated as it integrates into the endogenous network.\n\n3. Predicted outcome for Experiment 2 (injected fluorescent pre-assembled keratin filaments):\n- Pre-assembled IFs are large, polymerized structures that are not the normal exchange-competent species. The endogenous network does not incorporate entire exogenous filaments into its lattice; instead, it exchanges subunits.\n- There is no established mechanism to splice or intercalate whole exogenous filaments into an already cross-linked, anchored keratin network. Moreover, IFs lack intrinsic polarity-driven end dynamics that would facilitate end-joining in vivo.\n- Consequently, injected pre-assembled filaments are expected to remain as separate entities. Without proper integration and crosslinking to the endogenous network or junctional complexes, they typically persist as cytoplasmic bundles or aggregates, often appearing as distinct fluorescent clumps or short fibers that do not co-localize with the endogenous keratin network at junctions.\n\n4. Elimination of alternative options:\n- Option B (both integrate) is inconsistent with IF dynamics that favor subunit exchange rather than wholesale filament insertion.\n- Option C (tetramers degraded; pre-assembled filaments integrate) reverses known biology: soluble subunits are the normal assembly pool; whole filaments are not readily integrated.\n- Option D (both degraded via autophagy) contradicts the known stability and turnover pathway of keratin; injected tetramers are not preferentially routed to lysosomes under normal conditions.\n- Option E (tetramers form a de novo, separate perinuclear network; pre-assembled filaments migrate and align independently of junctions) conflicts with the templated incorporation of subunits into existing networks and with the lack of directed migration/integration mechanisms for pre-assembled filaments.\n\nConclusion: The predicted outcomes match Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2346946"}, {"introduction": "The function of many proteins is dictated by their precise location, a process often controlled by chemical modifications. This problem focuses on nuclear lamins and the essential role of a lipid modification—farnesylation—in guiding them to the inner nuclear membrane. By considering a mutant lamin protein that cannot be farnesylated, you will connect a specific molecular event to the large-scale process of nuclear reassembly following cell division. [@problem_id:2346922]", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the nuclear lamina is a dense fibrillar network on the inner surface of the nuclear envelope, composed of intermediate filaments called lamins. Lamins are critical for maintaining nuclear structure and organizing chromatin. B-type lamins, such as Lamin B1 and B2, are distinguished by a particular post-translational modification. They possess a C-terminal amino acid sequence motif known as a \"CaaX box\" (where 'C' is cysteine, 'a' is an aliphatic amino acid, and 'X' can be one of several residues). This motif directs the enzymatic attachment of a 15-carbon lipid group called a farnesyl group to the cysteine residue. This lipid modification, or farnesylation, is essential for mediating the protein's interaction with membranes.\n\nConsider a cell biology experiment where a human cell line is genetically engineered to express a mutant form of Lamin B1. In this mutant protein, the four amino acids that constitute the C-terminal CaaX box have been deleted. The expression level of this non-farnesylated mutant Lamin B1 is similar to that of the wild-type protein in control cells. These engineered cells are synchronized and observed as they progress through mitosis and enter the subsequent G1 phase.\n\nBased on the known roles of B-type lamins and protein lipidation, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the cellular localization of the mutant Lamin B1 protein and the principal consequence for nuclear reassembly after anaphase?\n\nA. The mutant Lamin B1 will remain soluble in the cytoplasm and fail to associate with chromatin-bound vesicles, leading to a severe impairment or failure of nuclear envelope reassembly.\n\nB. The mutant Lamin B1 will be recognized as improperly modified and will be rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, leading to a phenotypically normal cell due to compensation by other lamins.\n\nC. The mutant Lamin B1 will successfully incorporate into the reforming nuclear lamina but will be unable to polymerize correctly, resulting in an abnormally fragile nuclear envelope that is prone to rupture.\n\nD. The mutant Lamin B1 will mislocalize and permanently associate with the general endoplasmic reticulum membrane, sequestering binding partners and thus indirectly inhibiting nuclear reformation.\n\nE. The farnesyl group is only required for interphase targeting, so the mutant Lamin B1 will localize correctly to the reforming nuclear envelope, but the resulting nucleus will be unable to expand to its normal size.", "solution": "Principle 1: B-type lamins (e.g., Lamin B1) contain a C-terminal CaaX motif that is farnesylated by protein farnesyltransferase. The attached farnesyl group is a hydrophobic anchor that mediates stable association of Lamin B with membranes, including inner nuclear membrane and nuclear envelope precursor membranes.\n\nPrinciple 2: In contrast to Lamin A, which ultimately loses its farnesyl group during maturation, B-type lamins remain permanently farnesylated. This lipidation is required for their membrane targeting and for recruiting/anchoring nuclear envelope membranes to chromatin during mitotic exit and early G1.\n\nManipulation: Deleting the four residues of the CaaX box eliminates the acceptor cysteine and thus prevents farnesylation. The mutant Lamin B1 therefore lacks the hydrophobic anchor necessary for membrane association.\n\nPrediction for localization: Without farnesylation, Lamin B1 is unable to stably associate with endoplasmic reticulum–derived and nuclear envelope precursor membranes or with chromatin-bound vesicles during anaphase/telophase. It will remain soluble in the cytoplasm rather than being targeted to the reforming nuclear envelope.\n\nConsequence for nuclear reassembly: B-type lamins are critical for nuclear envelope reassembly at mitotic exit by facilitating membrane recruitment and lamina formation around decondensing chromosomes. Failure of membrane association by Lamin B1 severely impairs this process, leading to defective or failed nuclear envelope reformation. Alternatives are inconsistent: rapid degradation conflicts with the stated similar expression level; polymerization defects are not the primary consequence of lost farnesylation; mislocalization to ER requires farnesylation rather than its absence; the requirement for farnesylation is not limited to interphase but is crucial at mitotic exit.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that the mutant remains soluble and causes severe impairment in nuclear envelope reassembly.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2346922"}]}
