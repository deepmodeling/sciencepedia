This exercise [@problem_id:2338593] explores the fundamental necessity of this molecular machinery. By simulating the effect of a highly specific toxin, you can deduce the direct consequences of breaking a single, critical link in the chain of events leading to neurotransmitter release.", "problem": "A team of neurobiologists is investigating a novel toxin, \"Silentin,\" isolated from a marine sponge. When applied to a neuronal culture, Silentin causes a rapid and complete cessation of communication between neurons. Further biochemical analysis reveals that the toxin's sole molecular action is to act as a highly specific protease that cleaves a single protein: synaptobrevin. Synaptobrevin is a v-SNARE, a class of proteins found on the membrane of synaptic vesicles. These vesicles are filled with neurotransmitters and are located in the presynaptic terminal. The fusion of these vesicles with the presynaptic membrane is mediated by the formation of a Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein REceptor (SNARE) complex, which involves synaptobrevin, as well as the t-SNARE proteins syntaxin and SNAP-25 on the presynaptic plasma membrane.\n\nAssuming the toxin has no other effects on the neuron, what is the most direct and immediate consequence of synaptobrevin cleavage by Silentin on the process of synaptic transmission?\n\nA. The propagation of the action potential along the presynaptic axon is blocked.\n\nB. Synaptic vesicles are unable to fuse with the presynaptic membrane to release their neurotransmitter content.\n\nC. The synthesis of neurotransmitter molecules within the presynaptic terminal is inhibited.\n\nD. Neurotransmitters are released normally, but they are prevented from binding to their receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.\n\nE. Synaptic vesicles are unable to be filled with neurotransmitter molecules by their specific transporters.", "solution": "We are told Silentin is a highly specific protease that cleaves synaptobrevin. Synaptobrevin is a v-SNARE located on synaptic vesicles. Neurotransmitter release at chemical synapses requires $Ca^{2+}$-triggered fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. This membrane fusion is mediated by formation of the trans-SNARE complex, which minimally requires the v-SNARE synaptobrevin on the vesicle and the t-SNAREs syntaxin and SNAP-25 on the presynaptic membrane.\n\nCleavage of synaptobrevin removes a necessary component of the SNARE complex. Without intact synaptobrevin, the trans-SNARE complex cannot assemble. In the absence of a functional SNARE complex, synaptic vesicles cannot undergo the membrane fusion step of exocytosis, even if $Ca^{2+}$ enters normally in response to an action potential.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate consequence is prevention of synaptic vesicle fusion with the presynaptic membrane and thus failure to release neurotransmitter. This specifically matches option B. The other options are not directly affected by synaptobrevin cleavage: action potential propagation along the axon depends on voltage-gated $Na^{+}$ and $K^{+}$ channels (not SNAREs), neurotransmitter synthesis and vesicular filling depend on biosynthetic enzymes and vesicular transporters with a proton gradient (not SNAREs), and postsynaptic receptor binding is downstream of release and not directly altered by a presynaptic v-SNARE proteolysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2338593"}, {"introduction": "After driving membrane fusion, SNARE proteins are left in a highly stable, tangled state that must be reset for the next round of vesicle trafficking. This practice [@problem_id:2338583] challenges you to identify the energy-dependent step in this recycling process. Understanding where energy from ATP hydrolysis is consumed is crucial to appreciating the full dynamics of the SNARE cycle and sustained cellular communication.", "problem": "In neurons, the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft is a tightly regulated process involving the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. This fusion is orchestrated by a family of proteins known as SNAREs. A vesicle-associated SNARE (v-SNARE) on the synaptic vesicle interacts with two target-membrane SNAREs (t-SNAREs) on the plasma membrane. This interaction drives the formation of a stable four-helix bundle, known as the trans-SNARE complex, which pulls the two membranes into close proximity, catalyzing their fusion.\n\nFollowing the fusion event and release of neurotransmitters, the v-SNARE and t-SNAREs remain entangled on the plasma membrane in an extremely stable configuration called the cis-SNARE complex. For sustained neurotransmission to occur, this cis-SNARE complex must be disassembled, allowing the SNARE proteins to be recycled for subsequent rounds of vesicle fusion. This disassembly process is an active, energy-dependent step.\n\nAn experiment is conducted on a preparation of isolated nerve terminals. A high concentration of ATP-γS, a non-hydrolyzable analog of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), is introduced into the cytosol. ATP-γS can bind to ATP-binding sites on enzymes but cannot be hydrolyzed to release energy.\n\nGiven this experimental setup, which of the following specific steps in the SNARE-mediated fusion cycle will be directly arrested?\n\nA. The initial docking of the synaptic vesicle to the presynaptic membrane before the SNAREs engage.\n\nB. The \"zippering\" of the v-SNARE and t-SNAREs, leading to the formation of the tight four-helix bundle that drives membrane fusion.\n\nC. The dissociation of the stable cis-SNARE complex after membrane fusion has occurred.\n\nD. The conformational change in the t-SNARE syntaxin from a \"closed\" to an \"open\" state, which is a prerequisite for its engagement with other SNAREs.\n\nE. The influx of $Ca^{2+}$ ions through voltage-gated channels, which serves as the primary trigger for rapid, synchronous fusion.", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the specific step in the SNARE-mediated fusion cycle that is inhibited by a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog. This requires identifying the step that directly consumes energy via ATP hydrolysis.\n\nLet's analyze the SNARE cycle and the role of ATP.\n\n1.  **Vesicle Docking and trans-SNARE Complex Formation:** The initial docking of a vesicle is mediated by tethering proteins. The subsequent formation of the trans-SNARE complex, where the v-SNARE on the vesicle pairs with the t-SNAREs on the target membrane, is an energetically favorable, spontaneous process. It does not require ATP hydrolysis. Option A is incorrect.\n\n2.  **Membrane Fusion:** The \"zippering\" of the SNARE proteins from their membrane-distal ends towards their membrane-proximal ends to form a tight four-helix bundle is a highly exergonic process. The energy released from this conformational change is used to overcome the electrostatic and hydration barriers to bring the lipid bilayers together and induce fusion. This step does not require an input of energy from ATP hydrolysis; rather, it releases energy. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\n3.  **cis-SNARE Complex Disassembly:** After fusion, the v-SNARE and t-SNAREs are locked together in a very stable cis-SNARE complex on the target membrane. This complex is thermodynamically stable and will not dissociate on its own. To recycle the SNARE proteins for another round of fusion, this complex must be actively disassembled. This task is performed by a protein called NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor), which is a member of the AAA (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) family of proteins.\n\n4.  **The Role of NSF and ATP:** NSF, in conjunction with adaptor proteins called SNAPs (Soluble NSF Attachment Proteins), binds to the cis-SNARE complex. NSF then uses the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis (ATP → ADP + Pi) to undergo a large conformational change. This change generates a mechanical force that unravels the tightly wound SNARE helices, thereby dissociating the cis-SNARE complex.\n\n5.  **Effect of ATP-γS:** The non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, ATP-γS, can bind to the ATP-binding pocket of NSF. However, since it cannot be hydrolyzed, NSF cannot perform the power stroke required to unwind the SNARE complex. The system becomes arrested with NSF and SNAPs bound to the cis-SNARE complex, but disassembly cannot proceed. This directly corresponds to the step described in option C.\n\n6.  **Other Steps:** The activation of syntaxin from a closed to an open conformation (Option D) is primarily regulated by proteins of the Sec1/Munc18 family, not directly by NSF-mediated ATP hydrolysis. The influx of $Ca^{2+}$ (Option E) is a signaling event mediated by ion channels and is upstream of the final fusion machinery's action; it is not part of the ATP-dependent recycling of the SNARE machinery itself.\n\nTherefore, the introduction of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog specifically arrests the disassembly of the cis-SNARE complex because the NSF ATPase cannot obtain the energy required to do its work.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2338583"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a qualitative to a quantitative understanding is a key step in mastering molecular biology, allowing us to describe not just what happens, but how fast.

They prepare two distinct populations of liposomes (artificial lipid vesicles). The first population, representing the synaptic vesicle, has the v-SNARE protein synaptobrevin incorporated into its membrane. Each synaptobrevin protein is tagged with a donor fluorophore. The second population, representing the presynaptic target membrane, has the t-SNARE proteins (syntaxin and SNAP-25) incorporated, with the t-SNARE complex being tagged with a compatible acceptor fluorophore.\n\nThe fluorophore pair is designed for Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), a process where energy is transferred non-radiatively from an excited donor to an acceptor fluorophore. This transfer is highly efficient only when the two fluorophores are in very close proximity (a few nanometers), a condition that is met upon the successful formation of the stable *trans*-SNARE complex from its v-SNARE and t-SNARE components.\n\nThe experiment is initiated at time $t=0$ by mixing the two liposome populations.

The FRET signal, which is proportional to the concentration of assembled *trans*-SNARE complexes, is monitored over time and measured in arbitrary fluorescence units (AFU). After allowing the reaction to proceed for a very long time, it reaches completion, and the maximum FRET signal is recorded as $F_{max} = 850$ AFU.
