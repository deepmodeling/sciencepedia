{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding the kinetics of actin polymerization is fundamental to cell biology. This first exercise ([@problem_id:2302218]) uses the scenario of a pyrene-actin fluorescence assay to explore why actin filament formation has a slow initial 'lag' phase and how the Arp2/3 complex dramatically accelerates this process. By analyzing this hypothetical data, you will solidify your understanding of nucleation as the rate-limiting step and the core function of branching nucleators.", "problem": "A cell biologist is studying actin dynamics using a pyrene-actin fluorescence assay. In this assay, the fluorescence of pyrene-labeled globular actin (G-actin) monomers is low but increases significantly upon their incorporation into filamentous actin (F-actin). The rate of fluorescence increase is therefore a direct measure of the overall rate of actin polymerization.\n\nThe experiment compares two conditions:\n1.  A solution containing only G-actin monomers above the critical concentration.\n2.  A solution containing G-actin (at the same concentration as in condition 1), a small number of pre-existing F-actin \"mother\" filaments, the Actin-Related Protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex, and a Nucleation-Promoting Factor (NPF).\n\nThe biologist observes that the rate of fluorescence increase is dramatically faster in the second condition compared to the first, and the initial lag period seen in the first condition is virtually absent in the second. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate mechanistic explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The Arp2/3 complex directly enhances the rate constant for G-actin monomer addition onto the barbed ends of all existing filaments.\nB. The Arp2/3 complex, upon activation by the NPF, binds to the sides of pre-existing F-actin and templates the formation of new daughter filaments, thereby exponentially increasing the number of sites for polymerization.\nC. The NPF acts as a potent polymerase that rapidly assembles G-actin into filaments, with the Arp2/3 complex serving only to anchor these newly formed filaments to the mother filaments.\nD. The Arp2/3 complex functions by severing the pre-existing F-actin filaments into smaller fragments, which creates a larger total number of filament ends available for elongation.\nE. The Arp2/3 complex accelerates polymerization by cross-linking actin filaments into highly stable, parallel bundles that are resistant to depolymerization.", "solution": "We interpret the pyrene-actin fluorescence increase as proportional to the net rate of F-actin mass accumulation. For elongation at barbed ends when $[A]$ (G-actin) is above the critical concentration, the net polymer mass growth rate can be written schematically as\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} \\propto n_{b}\\left(k_{+}[A]-k_{-}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $n_{b}$ is the number of barbed ends available for elongation, $k_{+}$ is the second-order on-rate constant for monomer addition at barbed ends, and $k_{-}$ is the first-order off-rate constant. Above the critical concentration, $k_{+}[A]-k_{-}>0$, so the rate is dominated by $n_{b}$.\n\nCondition 1 (only G-actin above critical concentration) exhibits an initial lag because actin nucleation is rate-limiting: spontaneous formation of a stable nucleus (approximately a trimer) is energetically unfavorable, so $n_{b}$ remains low until nuclei form. Once nuclei and initial filaments appear, elongation proceeds, increasing fluorescence.\n\nCondition 2 includes pre-existing mother filaments, Arp2/3, and an NPF. NPFs activate Arp2/3, which then binds the sides of existing F-actin and templates nucleation of a new, branched daughter filament whose pointed end is capped by the Arp2/3 complex and whose barbed end is free to elongate rapidly. This mechanism directly increases $n_{b}$ by creating new barbed ends on daughter filaments. Because each new filament can itself serve as a substrate for further Arp2/3-mediated branching, $n_{b}$ can grow approximately exponentially during the early phase, greatly accelerating $\\frac{dM}{dt}$ and removing the lag associated with spontaneous nucleation.\n\nWe now evaluate the options mechanistically:\n- A is incorrect because Arp2/3 does not directly increase $k_{+}$ at barbed ends; it increases $n_{b}$ by nucleating branches.\n- B is correct: NPF-activated Arp2/3 binds filament sides and nucleates new daughter filaments, increasing the number of barbed ends and eliminating the nucleation lag.\n- C is incorrect because NPFs are not polymerases; they activate Arp2/3 and can deliver actin monomers but do not catalyze elongation like a polymerase. Arp2/3 is not merely an anchor; it is the branching nucleator.\n- D is incorrect because severing is primarily mediated by proteins such as cofilin; Arp2/3 is a branching nucleator rather than a severing factor.\n- E is incorrect because cross-linking into bundles (e.g., by fascin or fimbrin) does not explain the rapid increase in barbed ends or the elimination of the lag; Arp2/3 forms branched, not parallel bundled, networks.\n\nTherefore, the observed rapid fluorescence increase and absence of lag in condition 2 are best explained by Arp2/3-mediated branching nucleation activated by the NPF, which increases $n_{b}$ and bypasses the nucleation barrier.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2302218"}, {"introduction": "While the Arp2/3 complex is famous for creating branched networks, cells also need to build long, unbranched filaments for structures like stress fibers and the contractile ring. This is the job of formins, a distinct class of nucleators. This problem ([@problem_id:2302179]) presents a thought experiment involving a constitutively active formin mutant to help you contrast its function with that of Arp2/3 and appreciate how tight regulation of these powerful enzymes is essential for cytoskeletal organization.", "problem": "Formin proteins are a group of essential regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. They function as dimers to nucleate the formation of new actin filaments and remain associated with the growing (barbed) end, promoting the addition of G-actin monomers to create long, unbranched filaments. The activity of many formins is tightly controlled by an autoinhibitory mechanism. In this inactive state, the C-terminal region of the protein folds back and binds to the N-terminal formin-homology 2 (FH2) domain, blocking its ability to nucleate actin. This autoinhibition is typically relieved by the binding of an active Rho family GTPase, an event that triggers a conformational change and exposes the FH2 domain.\n\nConsider a quiescent, non-motile fibroblast cell in culture. A researcher introduces a genetic mutation into this cell that results in the expression of a formin variant in which the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain has been deleted. This mutated formin is therefore constitutively active, meaning it is always capable of nucleating actin filaments, independent of upstream cellular signals. T-actin, the total concentration of actin (both monomeric G-actin and filamentous F-actin), remains constant within the cell.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary consequence of expressing this constitutively active formin on the cell's actin cytoskeleton?\n\nA. An accumulation of long, unbranched actin filaments and a decrease in the concentration of free G-actin monomers.\nB. A significant increase in the density of the branched, dendritic actin network at the cell cortex.\nC. A complete disassembly of all existing actin filaments due to a failure in the recruitment of capping proteins.\nD. A rapid fragmentation of existing actin stress fibers into shorter filaments, increasing filament turnover.\nE. No significant change in the actin cytoskeleton, as the cell is non-motile and lacks the necessary signals for large-scale actin remodeling.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the core biochemical functions and regulation of formins. Formins dimerize and nucleate actin filaments, remaining processively associated with the barbed end via the FH2 domain while the FH1 domain recruits profilin–actin to promote elongation. Many formins are autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between an N-terminal regulatory region and the C-terminal FH2-containing region; binding of active Rho GTPases relieves this autoinhibition. Deletion of the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain yields a constitutively active enzyme that can nucleate and elongate filaments independent of upstream signals.\n\nLet the total actin concentration be constant:\n$$\nT_{\\text{actin}} = [\\text{G-actin}] + [\\text{F-actin}].\n$$\nConstitutively active formin will nucleate new filaments and accelerate barbed-end elongation of unbranched filaments. Therefore, $[\\text{F-actin}]$ increases. Because $T_{\\text{actin}}$ is constant, an increase in $[\\text{F-actin}]$ necessarily decreases $[\\text{G-actin}]$:\n$$\n\\Delta[\\text{F-actin}] > 0 \\implies \\Delta[\\text{G-actin}] < 0 \\quad \\text{given} \\quad \\Delta T_{\\text{actin}}=0.\n$$\nMoreover, formin-bound barbed ends are protected from capping proteins and efficiently supplied with profilin–actin via FH1, further biasing the pool toward filament elongation and away from free G-actin.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n- A: Predicts accumulation of long, unbranched filaments and a decrease in free monomer. This matches formin’s activity and the mass-balance constraint on $T_{\\text{actin}}$.\n- B: Branched network is primarily generated by the Arp2/3 complex activated by WASP/WAVE family proteins; formins do not increase branching and often compete for monomers, so a significant increase in branching is not expected.\n- C: Complete disassembly due to failure of capping recruitment is incorrect; formin protects barbed ends and promotes elongation rather than causing global disassembly.\n- D: Rapid fragmentation and increased turnover are hallmarks of severing proteins such as cofilin, not formin, which stabilizes elongating barbed ends.\n- E: Although the cell is quiescent, constitutive activation bypasses upstream signals; thus a significant shift toward unbranched F-actin and reduced G-actin is expected.\n\nTherefore, the primary consequence is described by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2302179"}, {"introduction": "Having established the functions of Arp2/3 and formins, we can now delve deeper into the molecular choreography of their activation. This advanced problem ([@problem_id:2302233]) challenges you to predict the outcome of a FRET-based assay designed to monitor the conformational changes within the Arp2/3 complex in real-time. Successfully navigating this scenario requires a detailed, step-by-step understanding of the activation process, moving from what the complex does to precisely how it does it.", "problem": "A cell biology researcher is investigating the activation mechanism of the Arp2/3 complex, a key protein assembly responsible for nucleating branched actin filaments. The current model suggests that the complex is inactive in solution and undergoes a significant conformational change to become an active nucleus. This change is thought to involve the two Actin-Related Proteins, Arp2 and Arp3, moving closer together to form a template that mimics an actin dimer.\n\nTo monitor this conformational change in real-time, the researcher has engineered a special version of the Arp2/3 complex. In this version, the Arp2 subunit is genetically fused to a Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP), which serves as a Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) donor. The Arp3 subunit is fused to a Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP), which serves as the FRET acceptor.\n\nThe experiment is conducted in a test tube. Initially, the tube contains only the purified, doubly-labeled Arp2/3 complex in a buffer solution that supports actin polymerization. The FRET signal is monitored as the ratio of YFP emission to CFP emission when the sample is excited with light at the CFP excitation wavelength. The following components are added sequentially to the tube, with the FRET signal being recorded after each addition and subsequent equilibration:\n\n1.  A solution of pre-polymerized, unlabeled \"mother\" actin filaments.\n2.  A solution of monomeric, ATP-bound G-actin.\n3.  A solution of the VCA (Verprolin-homology, cofilin-homology, and acidic) domain from the Nucleation Promoting Factor (NPF) N-WASP.\n\nBased on the widely accepted model of Arp2/3 activation, which of the following options best describes the sequence of *changes* in the FRET signal observed after each sequential addition, relative to the signal just before that addition?\n\nA. (1) No Change, (2) No Change, (3) Large Increase\nB. (1) Slight Increase, (2) No Change, (3) Large Increase\nC. (1) Large Increase, (2) No Change, (3) No Change\nD.

Under excitation of the donor (CFP), the FRET efficiency $E$ between donor and acceptor depends on the donor–acceptor distance $r$ as\n$$\nE=\\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{r}{R_{0}}\\right)^{6}},\n$$\nwhere $R_{0}$ is the Förster radius. The measured readout is the emission ratio $R=\\frac{I_{\\text{YFP}}}{I_{\\text{CFP}}}$ under donor excitation. Since $I_{\\text{YFP}}\\propto E$ and $I_{\\text{CFP}}\\propto 1-E$ (for constant excitation and detection conditions), we have $R\\propto \\frac{E}{1-E}$, which is a monotonic increasing function of $E$. Therefore, any decrease in $r$ produces an increase in $E$ and thus an increase in $R$.\n\nAccording to the widely accepted model of Arp2/3 activation: (i) in solution Arp2/3 is inactive with Arp2 and Arp3 separated, giving a baseline low $E$ (low $R$); (ii) binding to the side of a pre-existing actin “mother” filament positions the complex and can induce a modest structural rearrangement within Arp2/3, typically producing a small decrease in $r$ between Arp2 and Arp3; (iii) VCA from an NPF binds Arp2/3 (via the CA region) and recruits an actin monomer (via the V region), and together with the mother filament promotes the major conformational change that brings Arp2 and Arp3 into a dimer-like, short-pitch arrangement, substantially decreasing $r$.\n\nStep-by-step for the sequential additions, each judged relative to the signal just before that addition:\n\n1. Addition of pre-polymerized mother actin filaments: Arp2/3 can bind to the filament side even without NPF. This binding is known to induce at most a modest conformational tightening that slightly decreases $r$, hence slightly increases $E$ and thus $R$. Predicted change: slight increase.\n\n2. Addition of ATP–G-actin monomers: In the absence of VCA, G-actin does not bind productively to Arp2/3, and there is no expected conformational activation. Hence $r$ is unchanged, $E$ unchanged, and $R$ unchanged. Predicted change: no change.\n\n3. Addition of VCA (from N-WASP): VCA binds Arp2/3 and recruits an actin monomer; in the presence of the mother filament this triggers the large activation rearrangement that brings Arp2 and Arp3 together, substantially decreasing $r$, thus producing a large increase in $E$ and $R$. Predicted change: large increase.\n\nThe sequence of changes is therefore: (1) slight increase, (2) no change, (3) large increase, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2302233"}]}
