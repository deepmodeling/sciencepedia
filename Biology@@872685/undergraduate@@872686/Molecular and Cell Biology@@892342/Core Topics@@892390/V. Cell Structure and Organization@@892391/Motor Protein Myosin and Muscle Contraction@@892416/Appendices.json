To truly understand this molecular engine, it is essential to dissect the specific roles of ATP binding versus its subsequent hydrolysis. This practice uses a thought experiment with a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog to clarify how ATP binding alone affects the interaction between myosin and actin, a key step in resetting the motor for another cycle. [@problem_id:2325845]", "problem": "In a laboratory experiment, a researcher prepares a sample of skeletal muscle fibers that have been treated with a mild detergent. This treatment makes the cell membranes and sarcoplasmic reticulum permeable, allowing direct access to the contractile machinery (actin and myosin) while washing away the cell's native Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$). To initiate contraction, the researcher adds a buffer solution containing a high concentration of calcium ions. Following this, a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog is introduced into the buffer. This analog can bind to the ATP-binding site on the myosin head with the same affinity as ATP, but it cannot be broken down into ADP and inorganic phosphate.\n\nWhat is the most immediate and primary consequence for the myosin heads within the cross-bridge cycle upon the introduction of this non-hydrolyzable ATP analog?\n\nA. Myosin heads will remain permanently attached to the actin filaments in a state of rigor.\n\nB. Myosin heads will detach from the actin filaments and will be unable to re-bind to them.\n\nC. The power stroke will occur, but the myosin heads will then be unable to detach from the actin filaments.\n\nD. The sarcoplasmic reticulum will release a massive, uncontrolled flood of calcium ions, causing titanic contraction.\n\nE. Myosin heads will bind to actin but will be unable to perform the power stroke.", "solution": "The cross-bridge cycle relies on the following nucleotide-dependent transitions of the myosin head ($M$) with actin ($A$):\n1) In the absence of nucleotide, the myosin head is tightly bound to actin (rigor): $A\\cdot M$.\n2) Binding of ATP to myosin induces a conformational change that markedly lowers myosin’s affinity for actin, causing detachment:\n$$A\\cdot M + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow A + M\\cdot \\text{ATP}.$$\n3) Hydrolysis of ATP while myosin is detached cocks the head:\n$$M\\cdot \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow M\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{\\text{i}}.$$\n4) The cocked $M\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{\\text{i}}$ weakly binds actin:\n$$M\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{\\text{i}} + A \\rightleftharpoons A\\cdot M\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{\\text{i}}.$$\n5) Release of $P_{\\text{i}}$ triggers the power stroke and strong binding; subsequent ADP release returns to the rigor-like $A\\cdot M$ state:\n$$A\\cdot M\\cdot \\text{ADP}\\cdot P_{\\text{i}} \\rightarrow A\\cdot M\\cdot \\text{ADP} + P_{\\text{i}} \\rightarrow A\\cdot M + \\text{ADP}.$$\n\nIn the experiment, the fibers are permeabilized, and native ATP and $Ca^{2+}$ are washed out. High $Ca^{2+}$ is then supplied, exposing actin sites.

The sarcoplasmic reticulum is irrelevant here due to permeabilization, and rigor attachment would only occur in the absence of any ATP-like ligand.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2325845"}, {"introduction": "While ATP provides the power for contraction, the process is not constantly active. Skeletal muscle contraction is precisely regulated by calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$), which function as a crucial molecular switch. This exercise explores the critical role of the troponin complex in this regulatory pathway, asking you to predict the physiological outcome of a hypothetical mutation that disables its ability to sense calcium, thereby highlighting the necessity of this control mechanism. [@problem_id:2325876]", "problem": "In skeletal muscle cells, contraction is a finely regulated process initiated by a nerve impulse. The impulse triggers the release of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from an intracellular storage organelle, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). These released $Ca^{2+}$ ions interact with a protein complex called troponin, which is attached to another protein, tropomyosin. In a resting muscle, tropomyosin is positioned along the actin filaments in a way that physically blocks the sites where myosin heads would otherwise bind.\n\nThe troponin complex itself consists of three subunits: troponin C (the calcium-binding site), troponin I (the inhibitory subunit), and troponin T (which links the complex to tropomyosin). The binding of $Ca^{2+}$ to troponin C is the critical step that causes a conformational change in the entire troponin-tropomyosin complex, shifting it to expose the myosin-binding sites on actin, thereby permitting contraction to begin.\n\nConsider a hypothetical genetic condition where an individual's muscle cells produce a mutated form of troponin C. This mutated protein is synthesized, folds correctly, and is properly integrated into the troponin complex on the actin filaments. However, due to a change in its primary structure, its $Ca^{2+}$ binding sites are non-functional, meaning it has a binding affinity for $Ca^{2+}$ that is effectively zero. Assume all other cellular components and systems, including the nervous system, SR calcium release/re-uptake, and ATP supply, are functioning perfectly.\n\nWhich of the following options best describes the resulting physiological state of the skeletal muscles in an individual with this condition?\n\nA. The muscles will be in a state of constant, rigid contraction (spastic paralysis or tetany).\n\nB. The muscles will be unable to contract in response to nerve signals (flaccid paralysis).\n\nC. The muscles will contract normally in response to nerve signals but will be unable to relax afterward.\n\nD. The muscles will be able to contract, but the force generated will be significantly weaker than normal.\n\nE.

In normal skeletal muscle activation, calcium binding to troponin C can be represented by the equilibrium\n$$\\text{TnC} + Ca^{2+} \\leftrightharpoons \\text{TnC}\\cdot Ca^{2+},$$\nwith dissociation constant\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[\\text{TnC}][Ca^{2+}]}{[\\text{TnC}\\cdot Ca^{2+}]},$$\nand fractional occupancy\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}]}{K_{d} + [Ca^{2+}]}.$$\nThe conformational change of the troponin-tropomyosin complex that exposes myosin-binding sites on actin is triggered by $Ca^{2+}$ binding, so the probability of thin filament activation is an increasing function of $\\theta$.\n\n2. In the described mutation, the troponin C $Ca^{2+}$ binding sites are non-functional, meaning the binding affinity is effectively zero. In equilibrium terms, this corresponds to $K_{d} \\to \\infty$.

With tropomyosin remaining in the blocking position, strong myosin-actin cross-bridges cannot form. Force production in muscle fibers scales with the number of cycling cross-bridges, for example\n$$F \\propto n_{\\text{xb}},$$\nwhere $n_{\\text{xb}}$ is the fraction of available, strongly bound cross-bridges.

A simplified kinetic model of this cycle in a fast-twitch muscle fiber under zero external load (allowing for maximum shortening velocity) consists of four sequential steps with the following average durations for a wild-type (WT) myosin motor:\n\n1.  **ATP Binding and Detachment**: The binding of an Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) molecule to the myosin head causes it to detach from the actin filament. Duration: $t_1 = 1.0$ ms.\n2.  **ATP Hydrolysis and Recovery Stroke**: The myosin head hydrolyzes ATP to Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi), and its lever arm \"re-cocks\" into a high-energy position. Duration: $t_2 = 4.0$ ms.\n3.  **Actin Binding and Power Stroke**: The myosin head binds weakly to actin, then releases Pi, which triggers the power stroke, a conformational change that pulls the actin filament. Duration: $t_3 = 1.5$ ms.\n4.  **ADP Release**: After the power stroke, ADP is released from the myosin head. This is the final step before a new ATP can bind. Duration: $t_4 = 2.5$ ms.\n\nThe total cycle time, $T$, is the sum of the durations of these four steps. The maximum shortening velocity, $v_{max}$, of the muscle fiber is inversely proportional to this total cycle time ($v_{max} \\propto 1/T$).\n\nThe \"duty ratio,\" $d$, represents the fraction of the total cycle time during which the myosin head is strongly bound to the actin filament and capable of producing or resisting force. In this model, the strong-binding state corresponds to the power stroke and ADP release phases (Steps 3 and 4).\n\nNow, consider a specific genetic mutation that alters the myosin head's affinity for ADP. This mutation does not affect the durations of Steps 1, 2, or 3, but it dramatically slows the dissociation of ADP, increasing the duration of Step 4 by a factor of 40.\n\nBased on this model, which of the following statements most accurately describes the consequences of this mutation on the muscle fiber's properties?\n\nA.
