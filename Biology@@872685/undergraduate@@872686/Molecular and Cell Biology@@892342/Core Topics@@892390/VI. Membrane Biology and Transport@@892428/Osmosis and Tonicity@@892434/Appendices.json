To do this, four uniform cylindrical cores are bored from a single potato. The initial mass of each core is measured. Each core is then submerged in a separate beaker containing a sucrose solution of a specific, known molarity. The beakers are left undisturbed for 90 minutes to allow the potato cells to equilibrate with the surrounding solution. After the incubation period, the cores are removed, carefully blotted dry to remove excess surface water, and their final mass is measured. The student's recorded data is presented below:\n\n| Sample | Sucrose Molarity (mol/L) | Initial Mass (g) | Final Mass (g) |\n| :----: | :----------------------: | :--------------: | :--------------: |\n| 1      | 0.0                      | 1.512            | 1.633            |\n| 2      | 0.2                      | 1.505            | 1.550            |\n| 3      | 0.4                      | 1.521            | 1.460            |\n| 4      | 0.6                      | 1.518            | 1.397            |\n\nThe isotonic point is the molar concentration of the external solution at which there is no net movement of water into or out of the cells, and thus no change in mass.
