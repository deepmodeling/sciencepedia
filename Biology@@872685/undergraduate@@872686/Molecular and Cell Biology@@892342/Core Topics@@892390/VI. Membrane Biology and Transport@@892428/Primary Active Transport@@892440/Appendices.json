Its primary role is to establish and maintain the electrochemical gradients for sodium and potassium ions, a process fundamental to nerve impulses, nutrient transport, and cell volume regulation. This first exercise focuses on the pump's strict stoichiometry, connecting the macroscopic rate of energy consumption (ATP hydrolysis) to the microscopic movement of individual charges across the membrane [@problem_id:2064247].", "problem": "A neuron maintains its resting membrane potential through the action of the Sodium-Potassium (Na+/K+) pump, a crucial example of primary active transport. This pump operates with a specific stoichiometry: for each molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) that is hydrolyzed to fuel the process, the pump actively transports three sodium ions (Na+) out of the cell and two potassium ions (K+) into the cell. Assume that both Na+ and K+ are singly-charged positive ions.\n\nA particular cultured neuron is observed under conditions where the Na+/K+ pump is its primary metabolic load. The cell is found to hydrolyze ATP solely for this purpose at a constant rate of $2.50 \\times 10^{-6}$ moles per minute.\n\nGiven Avogadro's number, $N_A = 6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\text{mol}^{-1}$, calculate the total number of individual positive charges that are exported from the neuron by the Na+/K+ pump over a period of 1.00 minute.

The ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily represents another major class of transporters, essential for moving a vast array of substrates across membranes. This conceptual problem explores the intricate mechanical cycle of an ABC transporter, where ATP binding, not just its hydrolysis, powers critical conformational changes [@problem_id:2331326].", "problem": "A bacterial cell expresses a specific type of ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter that functions as an efflux pump, actively transporting a certain antibiotic out of the cytoplasm. The normal transport cycle for this protein is understood to proceed through the following key steps:\n1.  The transporter is in an inward-facing conformation, exposing its substrate-binding site to the cytoplasm.\n2.  The antibiotic substrate binds to the transporter from the cytoplasm.\n3.  Two molecules of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) bind to the transporter's Nucleotide-Binding Domains (NBDs).\n4.  The binding of ATP induces a major conformational change, causing the transporter to switch to an outward-facing state. This change simultaneously lowers the affinity for the substrate, causing its release into the extracellular space.\n5.  The subsequent hydrolysis of ATP to Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi), followed by the release of ADP and Pi, resets the transporter back to its original inward-facing conformation, ready for another cycle.\n\nConsider a scenario where a genetic mutation is introduced into the catalytic residue within the NBDs. This specific mutation allows the NBDs to bind ATP with normal affinity but completely prevents the hydrolysis of the bound ATP.\n\nAssuming both the antibiotic and ATP are present in sufficient concentrations to initiate one transport event, which of the following options best describes the resulting state of this single, mutated transporter molecule?\n\nA. The transporter remains permanently in the inward-facing conformation, bound to the antibiotic.\n\nB. The transporter becomes arrested in a stable, outward-facing conformation.\n\nC. The transporter continuously and rapidly cycles between the inward- and outward-facing conformations without net transport of the antibiotic.\n\nD. The transporter successfully transports one molecule of antibiotic and then hydrolyzes ATP, but fails to release the resulting ADP and Pi.\n\nE. The transporter binds ATP but immediately releases it without a conformational change, as it cannot be hydrolyzed.", "solution": "We model the transporter as an ABC exporter with two coupled domains: transmembrane domains (TMDs) that switch between inward- and outward-facing conformations, and nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) that bind and hydrolyze ATP. The key mechanistic principles are:\n- ATP binding to the NBDs drives NBD dimerization, which allosterically switches the TMDs from inward- to outward-facing and lowers substrate affinity on the cytosolic side.\n- Substrate is released to the extracellular space upon the outward-facing transition.\n- ATP hydrolysis followed by release of ADP and $P_{i}$ breaks the NBD dimer and resets the transporter to the inward-facing conformation.\n\nLet $E_{\\text{in}}$ denote the inward-facing transporter, $E_{\\text{out}}$ the outward-facing transporter, $S$ the substrate (antibiotic), and $\\text{ATP}$, $\\text{ADP}$, $P_{i}$ the nucleotides and phosphate.

Therefore, the following steps occur when both $S$ and ATP are available:\n1. Substrate binding:\n$$\nE_{\\text{in}} + S \\to E_{\\text{in}}:S.\n$$\n2. ATP binding (with normal affinity):\n$$\nE_{\\text{in}}:S + 2\\,\\text{ATP} \\to E_{\\text{in}}:S:(\\text{ATP})_{2}.\n$$\n3. ATP-induced conformational change (NBD dimerization leads to TMD switch and reduced substrate affinity, causing release to the outside):\n$$\nE_{\\text{in}}:S:(\\text{ATP})_{2} \\to E_{\\text{out}}:(\\text{ATP})_{2} + S_{\\text{out}}.\n$$\n4.

The consequence is arrest in a stable outward-facing, ATP-bound state.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is false because ATP binding triggers the outward-facing transition; the transporter does not remain inward-facing with substrate bound.\n- B is true because the protein reaches the outward-facing state upon ATP binding and becomes arrested there without hydrolysis to reset.\n- C is false because cycling requires hydrolysis to reset; without hydrolysis, no rapid oscillation occurs.\n- D is false because hydrolysis cannot occur in the mutant.\n- E is false because ATP binding still induces the conformational change; it is not immediately released for lack of hydrolysis.\n\nTherefore, the best description is arrest in a stable outward-facing conformation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2331326"}, {"introduction": "Ultimately, all active transporters are molecular machines governed by the laws of thermodynamics.
