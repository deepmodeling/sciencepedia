This exercise explores the fundamental trade-off between molecular size and lipid solubility (hydrophobicity), two key determinants of diffusion rate. By analyzing two hypothetical anesthetics, you will practice quantifying how these competing properties affect the overall flux across a membrane, a core concept in pharmacology and drug design [@problem_id:2338295].", "problem": "Two novel gaseous anesthetics, Anesthesin-A and Anesthesin-B, are being evaluated for their potential to rapidly cross the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), a selective membrane that protects the central nervous system. The transport of these anesthetics across the BBB occurs primarily via simple diffusion through the lipid bilayer of the endothelial cells.\n\nFor a molecule crossing a lipid membrane via simple diffusion, the rate of transport (flux) for a given concentration gradient is governed by its physicochemical properties. Based on biophysical models, this flux is known to be directly proportional to the molecule's lipid/water partition coefficient, $K$, and inversely proportional to its effective molecular radius, $r$. The partition coefficient $K$ is a measure of a molecule's hydrophobicity; a higher value indicates greater solubility in lipids.\n\nAnesthesin-A is the current standard, with an effective molecular radius of $r_A$ and a partition coefficient of $K_A$. The newly synthesized Anesthesin-B is smaller but more polar. Its effective molecular radius, $r_B$, is 80% of Anesthesin-A's radius. Due to its increased polarity, its partition coefficient, $K_B$, is only 60% of Anesthesin-A's coefficient.\n\nAssuming that identical initial concentration gradients are established for both anesthetics across the BBB, calculate the ratio of the initial diffusion flux of Anesthesin-B to that of Anesthesin-A.
