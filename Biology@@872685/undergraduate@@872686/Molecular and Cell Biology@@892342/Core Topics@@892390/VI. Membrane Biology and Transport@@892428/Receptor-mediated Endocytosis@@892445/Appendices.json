This selectivity is enforced by adaptin proteins, which act as crucial intermediaries that recognize cargo-bound receptors and recruit the clathrin machinery. This exercise [@problem_id:2335139] invites you to perform a thought experiment, predicting the cellular consequence of severing this critical link and thereby illuminating the primary function of adaptins in concentrating cargo.", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, receptor-mediated endocytosis is a crucial process for the selective uptake of macromolecules from the extracellular environment. This process involves a series of coordinated molecular events. A specific macromolecule, the ligand, binds to a transmembrane receptor. On the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, this ligand-receptor complex is recognized by adaptin proteins. Adaptins act as a bridge, binding both to the cytoplasmic tail of the cargo-loaded receptor and to clathrin molecules. Clathrin then polymerizes into a cage-like structure, forming a \"coated pit\" that invaginates and eventually pinches off to form a \"coated vesicle\" containing the ligand-receptor complex.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario in which a cell line is engineered with a specific mutation. In these mutant cells, the adaptin proteins are fully functional in every way, except they have lost their ability to bind to the cytoplasmic domains of any cargo receptors. All other proteins involved in endocytosis, including receptors, clathrin, and dynamin, are normal.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary and most immediate consequence of this specific mutation on the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis in this cell line?\n\nA. The specific association between cargo receptors and the clathrin coat would be disrupted, preventing the concentration of cargo into nascent vesicles.\nB. Clathrin triskelions would fail to assemble into a polyhedral lattice on the membrane surface.\nC. Coated vesicles would form successfully but would be unable to shed their clathrin coat in the cytoplasm.\nD. The GTPase dynamin would be unable to hydrolyze GTP, preventing the scission of the vesicle from the plasma membrane.\nE. Receptors would be unable to bind their specific extracellular ligands.", "solution": "Receptor-mediated endocytosis depends on specific recruitment of cargo receptors into clathrin-coated pits via adaptin complexes (e.g., AP2). In the normal pathway: (1) ligand binds its transmembrane receptor extracellularly; (2) cytoplasmic sorting motifs in the receptor tail are recognized by adaptins; (3) adaptins bind both the receptor tails and clathrin, bridging cargo to the forming clathrin lattice; (4) clathrin polymerizes into a cage to form a coated pit; (5) dynamin mediates scission; (6) the coat is shed by uncoating factors such as Hsc70 and auxilin.\n\nIn the engineered mutation, adaptins retain all functions except binding to receptor cytoplasmic tails. Therefore:\n- Adaptins can still bind clathrin and membrane components (such as phosphoinositides), so clathrin assembly per se is not inherently blocked.\n- However, the critical bridge between cargo receptors and the clathrin coat is lost, so receptors cannot be specifically captured and concentrated into nascent coated pits.\n- Consequently, the most immediate and primary effect is the disruption of the specific association between cargo receptors and the clathrin coat, preventing cargo concentration.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is correct: it states the loss of specific receptor–clathrin association via adaptins, preventing cargo concentration.\n- B is incorrect: clathrin can still assemble because adaptins can still interact with clathrin and the membrane; receptor binding by adaptins is not required for lattice assembly.\n- C is incorrect: uncoating involves Hsc70 and auxilin, not the receptor–adaptin interaction.\n- D is incorrect: dynamin’s GTPase activity is independent of adaptin–receptor binding.\n- E is incorrect: extracellular ligand binding to receptors is unaffected by the cytoplasmic adaptin-binding mutation.\n\nThus, the primary and immediate consequence is the failure to recruit and concentrate cargo receptors into coated pits.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2335139"}, {"introduction": "Once a clathrin-coated pit has formed and captured its cargo, it must successfully pinch off from the plasma membrane to become an independent vesicle. This scission event is a complex mechanical process driven by the GTPase dynamin, which assembles into a collar at the vesicle's neck. In this problem [@problem_id:2335160], we will explore the critical role of energy release in this process by examining a hypothetical scenario where dynamin can assemble but cannot hydrolyze GTP, effectively freezing the vesicle at its final stage of formation.", "problem": "In a cell biology research laboratory, a team is studying the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis, a critical pathway for the selective uptake of extracellular macromolecules. The normal process involves the binding of a ligand to its receptor, followed by the assembly of a clathrin protein coat on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane, which helps deform the membrane into a bud. A key protein in this process is dynamin, a large GTPase. In a particular experiment, the researchers are working with a genetically engineered cell line that expresses a mutant form of dynamin. This mutant dynamin is able to bind to Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) and correctly polymerize into a ring-like collar around the neck of a fully formed clathrin-coated pit. However, this mutant version has completely lost its ability to hydrolyze GTP into Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) and inorganic phosphate.\n\nAssuming all other cellular components are functioning normally, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the direct consequence of this specific dynamin mutation on the endocytic pathway in these cells?\n\nA. Ligands will fail to bind to their corresponding receptors on the outer surface of the plasma membrane.\nB. Clathrin and its associated adaptin proteins will be unable to assemble into a coated pit at the plasma membrane.\nC. Clathrin-coated pits will form and invaginate, but they will be unable to pinch off from the plasma membrane to become free vesicles.\nD. Endocytic vesicles will form successfully but will be unable to shed their clathrin coats once inside the cytosol.\nE. The transport of cargo from the resulting endocytic vesicles to the early endosome will be blocked.", "solution": "Receptor-mediated endocytosis proceeds through these key steps: extracellular ligands bind specific transmembrane receptors; adaptor proteins such as AP2 recruit clathrin to the cytosolic face, assembling a clathrin-coated pit that invaginates; dynamin, a large GTPase, assembles as a helical ring around the neck of the invaginated pit. Dynamin’s binding to GTP allows assembly at the neck, and the hydrolysis of GTP drives a conformational change that constricts the neck and catalyzes membrane scission, producing a free clathrin-coated vesicle. After scission, uncoating is mediated primarily by Hsc70 and auxilin and requires ATP, not GTP.\n\nIn the described mutant, dynamin can bind GTP and polymerize into the collar at the neck, but cannot hydrolyze GTP. Therefore, the crucial GTP hydrolysis–driven conformational change required for membrane constriction and scission cannot occur. As a direct consequence, clathrin-coated pits will still form (ligand binding and clathrin/adaptin assembly are intact) and will invaginate, but they will remain connected to the plasma membrane and fail to pinch off as free vesicles.\n\nThis rules out:\n- A: Ligand-receptor binding occurs upstream and is unaffected by dynamin’s GTPase activity.\n- B: Clathrin and adaptin assembly does not require dynamin’s GTP hydrolysis.\n- D: Uncoating depends on Hsc70 and auxilin with ATP, and in any case uncoating cannot occur if vesicles never pinch off.\n- E: Transport to early endosomes is downstream; the direct block is at scission, preventing vesicle formation in the first place.\n\nThus, the most accurate direct consequence is failure of scission of clathrin-coated pits.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2335160"}, {"introduction": "The efficiency of endocytosis can be finely tuned, and this regulation often occurs at the level of molecular recognition.

The cytoplasmic tail of the wild-type (WT) CAR protein contains a canonical sorting motif, $YXX\\Phi$ (where Y is tyrosine, X is any amino acid, and $\\Phi$ is a bulky hydrophobic residue), which is essential for its recruitment into clathrin-coated pits. This recruitment is mediated by the binding of the Adaptor Protein 2 (AP-2) complex to this motif. For high-affinity binding to occur, the tyrosine residue within the motif must first be phosphorylated by a specific cellular kinase.\n\nTo study the importance of this phosphorylation, the biologist creates a mutant version of the receptor (MUT) in which the critical tyrosine residue is replaced by phenylalanine (F). Phenylalanine is structurally similar to tyrosine but lacks the hydroxyl group, making it impossible to phosphorylate.\n\nBiochemical measurements reveal the following kinetic parameters for the interaction between the CAR receptor's cytoplasmic tail and the AP-2 complex:\n- The dissociation constant for the interaction between the phosphorylated WT motif and AP-2 is $K_{d,WT}$.\n- The dissociation constant for the interaction between the non-phosphorylatable MUT motif and AP-2 is $K_{d,MUT}$.
