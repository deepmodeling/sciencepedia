The focus of the study is the complete aerobic oxidation of stearic acid ($C_{18}H_{36}O_2$), a common 18-carbon saturated fatty acid. To quantify its energy contribution, the biochemist needs to determine the total net yield of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) from one molecule of stearic acid.\n\nFor your calculation, you must use the following established metabolic conversion values:\n- The initial activation of the fatty acid in the cytosol (converting it to stearoyl-CoA) requires an investment equivalent to 2 molecules of ATP.\n- Each cycle of beta-oxidation produces one molecule of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and one molecule of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2).\n- The complete oxidation of one molecule of acetyl-CoA in the citric acid cycle generates 3 NADH, 1 FADH2, and 1 guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Assume GTP is energetically equivalent to ATP.\n- In the electron transport chain, the re-oxidation of each molecule of NADH yields 2.5 ATP, and each molecule of FADH2 yields 1.5 ATP.\n\nCalculate the total net number of ATP molecules generated from the complete oxidation of a single molecule of stearic acid.

This perturbs the required hydride transfer and formation of the planar enoyl intermediate. In practice, cyclopropylacyl-CoA derivatives are poor substrates and can act as mechanism-based inhibitors of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, leading to failure of the very first step of the cycle once the ring reaches the $\\beta$ position.\n\nEnzymes acting earlier (acyl-CoA synthetase, carnitine acyltransferase I) function before the ring is at a problematic position, and enzymes acting later (enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, thiolase) are not reached because the initial dehydrogenation fails.
