Under these conditions, the cells efficiently produce Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation. The process relies on an electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, known as the proton-motive force (PMF), which is established by the electron transport chain (ETC).\n\nAn experiment is performed where the supply of oxygen to the culture is abruptly and completely halted, creating an anoxic environment. Assuming no other changes are made to the system, which of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate consequences for the mitochondrial electron transport chain and the proton-motive force?\n\nA. The electron transport chain will become fully reduced, halting the pumping of protons and causing a rapid dissipation of the proton-motive force.\nB. The proton-motive force will paradoxically increase, as protons are no longer consumed in the matrix to form water with oxygen, leading to a steeper gradient.\nC. The electron transport chain will reverse its direction of electron flow, actively pumping protons back into the mitochondrial matrix, thus collapsing the proton-motive force.\nD. ATP synthase will immediately stop functioning due to its direct requirement for oxygen, which in turn causes electrons to back up in the electron transport chain and the proton-motive force to collapse.\nE. The electron transport chain will continue to operate at a reduced rate by passing electrons to an alternative acceptor like lactate, thereby maintaining a weaker but stable proton-motive force.", "solution": "Oxidative phosphorylation couples exergonic electron transfer to endergonic proton pumping to build the proton-motive force across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The proton-motive force can be written as\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\Delta \\psi - \\frac{2.303 RT}{F}\\,\\Delta \\mathrm{pH},\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta \\psi$ is the electrical potential difference, $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ is the pH gradient (matrix minus intermembrane space), $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $F$ is Faraday’s constant. Maintenance of $\\Delta p$ requires continuous proton pumping by the electron transport chain (ETC), primarily at complexes I, III, and IV, which is driven by downhill electron flow from reduced substrates to the terminal electron acceptor oxygen.\n\nUnder normoxic conditions, electron flow from NADH and $FADH_2$ to oxygen via the ETC is thermodynamically favorable (negative $\\Delta G$), and the ETC pumps protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space, establishing $\\Delta p$. ATP synthase then allows protons to return to the matrix, coupling this flux to ATP synthesis; ATP synthase itself does not directly require oxygen, but it depends on $\\Delta p$.\n\nWhen oxygen is abruptly removed, the terminal electron acceptor is lost. Consequently:\n1) Electron transfer to oxygen at complex IV ceases immediately because the acceptor site is empty; complex IV remains in a reduced state.\n2) Upstream redox carriers (cytochrome c, coenzyme Q, complexes I and III, and matrix NADH pools) accumulate in reduced forms because electrons cannot be passed forward. Thus, the ETC becomes highly reduced.\n3) Because forward electron flow halts, proton pumping at complexes I, III, and IV stops, so the source term for building $\\Delta p$ becomes negligible. Denote the proton fluxes as $J_{H^{+}}^{\\mathrm{pump}}$ (ETC pumping), $J_{H^{+}}^{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ (proton influx through ATP synthase), and $J_{H^{+}}^{\\mathrm{leak}}$ (all other proton leak pathways). The balance governing the stored gradient is qualitatively\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(\\Delta p)\\propto J_{H^{+}}^{\\mathrm{pump}} - \\left(J_{H^{+}}^{\\mathrm{ATP}} + J_{H^{+}}^{\\mathrm{leak}}\\right).\n$$\nWith oxygen removed, $J_{H^{+}}^{\\mathrm{pump}}\\to 0$, while $J_{H^{+}}^{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ and $J_{H^{+}}^{\\mathrm{leak}}$ remain finite initially, so $\\Delta p$ decays rapidly.\n4) During this decay, ATP synthase can transiently continue to allow protons to flow into the matrix while synthesizing ATP until the gradient weakens; as $\\Delta p$ collapses, ATP synthase activity falls. There is no mechanism by which the ETC reverses to pump protons into the matrix under these conditions, nor does ATP synthase require oxygen directly. Eukaryotic mitochondria do not employ lactate as an alternative terminal acceptor to sustain proton pumping; cytosolic fermentation regenerates $NAD^+$ by reducing pyruvate to lactate but does not maintain mitochondrial proton pumping.\n\nTherefore, the immediate consequences of anoxia are: the ETC becomes fully reduced, proton pumping halts, and the existing proton-motive force dissipates rapidly due to continued proton influx through ATP synthase and intrinsic membrane leak pathways.
