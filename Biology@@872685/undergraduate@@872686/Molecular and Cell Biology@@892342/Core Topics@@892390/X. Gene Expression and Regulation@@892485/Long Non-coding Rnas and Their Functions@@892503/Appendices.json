A classic and powerful strategy is the \"loss-of-function\" approach: if we remove a component and a specific process breaks, we can infer the component was necessary for that process. This first exercise challenges you to select the most appropriate method for testing if a specific long non-coding RNA is essential for maintaining cell structure, introducing you to the fundamental technique of RNA interference (RNAi). [@problem_id:2321554]", "problem": "A molecular biology research team has identified a novel long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), a type of RNA molecule that is not translated into a protein. They have named this lncRNA `CytoScaffold`. The team observes that in cultured human skin cells, high expression levels of `CytoScaffold` correlate with a highly organized and robust actin cytoskeleton. Based on this correlation, they hypothesize that the `CytoScaffold` lncRNA is essential for maintaining cytoskeletal structure. To test this hypothesis, they need to perform an experiment that specifically reduces or eliminates the function of the `CytoScaffold` RNA molecule and then observe the effect on the actin cytoskeleton.\n\nWhich of the following experimental strategies represents the most direct and widely used loss-of-function approach to test the role of a specific RNA molecule like `CytoScaffold`?\n\nA. Overexpress `CytoScaffold` by transfecting the cells with a plasmid vector containing its gene under the control of a strong constitutive promoter.\n\nB. Use the CRISPR-Cas9 system to introduce a deletion in the `CytoScaffold` gene on the chromosome, thus creating a permanent gene knockout.\n\nC. Perform a Western blot using an antibody designed to recognize and bind to a unique sequence within the `CytoScaffold` lncRNA.\n\nD. Introduce a small interfering RNA (siRNA) designed to be complementary to the `CytoScaffold` RNA sequence into the cells.\n\nE. Treat the cells with a general transcription inhibitor, such as actinomycin D, which blocks the synthesis of all RNA molecules by RNA polymerase.", "solution": "We want a direct, specific loss-of-function test for an RNA molecule’s function in cells. The principle is to reduce or eliminate the RNA and observe phenotypic consequences (here, actin cytoskeleton organization).\n\nEvaluate each option against the criteria of specificity to the RNA and being a direct, widely used loss-of-function approach:\n- A is gain-of-function (overexpression), not loss-of-function, and thus does not test necessity.\n- B uses CRISPR-Cas9 to delete the genomic locus. While this is a loss-of-function of the gene, for lncRNAs this can introduce confounds by disrupting DNA regulatory elements or transcription at the locus independent of the RNA molecule itself. It is also less direct for testing RNA function per se and is not the most straightforward or widely used first approach to deplete an RNA transcript.\n- C is incorrect because Western blot detects proteins, not RNA; to detect RNA one would use Northern blot or RT-qPCR, but these are not loss-of-function interventions.\n- D uses siRNA complementary to the target RNA, leveraging RNA interference to specifically degrade the RNA transcript, yielding a direct, widely used, and rapid loss-of-function of the RNA molecule itself.\n- E is nonspecific; a general transcription inhibitor suppresses all RNA synthesis, preventing attribution of observed effects specifically to the target lncRNA.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and widely used loss-of-function approach for testing a specific RNA like a lncRNA is siRNA-mediated knockdown.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2321554"}, {"introduction": "While loss-of-function experiments test necessity, \"gain-of-function\" experiments test sufficiency—can introducing a lncRNA into a new context trigger a specific cellular change? However, proving this requires more than just observing an effect; it demands rigorous controls to rule out experimental artifacts. This practice focuses on designing the most critical control experiment to demonstrate that a lncRNA's specific sequence, and not some other factor, is responsible for a dramatic change in cell identity. [@problem_id:2321545]", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is investigating a newly discovered long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), which they have named `Myo-lnc1`. This lncRNA is highly expressed in developing skeletal muscle cells (myoblasts) but is completely absent in skin cells (fibroblasts). The team hypothesizes that forced expression of `Myo-lnc1` is *sufficient* to induce the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into myoblasts.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, they perform a gain-of-function experiment. They culture human fibroblasts and transfect them with a specially designed expression plasmid. This plasmid uses a strong, constitutive promoter to drive the high-level expression of the `Myo-lnc1` sequence. After several days, they analyze the cells and find that a significant portion now expresses `MyoD`, a master transcription factor that is a hallmark of myoblast identity.\n\nTo firmly establish that the specific biological activity of the `Myo-lnc1` molecule is sufficient for this cellular reprogramming, what is the most critical and specific control experiment the team must perform?\n\nA. Transfecting a parallel culture of fibroblasts with a plasmid expressing a scrambled RNA sequence of the same length and similar base composition as `Myo-lnc1`.\n\nB. Transfecting a parallel culture of fibroblasts with an \"empty\" plasmid that contains the strong promoter but lacks the `Myo-lnc1` sequence.\n\nC.

Measuring the expression levels of other known muscle-specific genes in the `Myo-lnc1`-transfected fibroblasts.\n\nE. Treating a parallel culture of untransfected fibroblasts with a chemical cocktail known to induce myogenic conversion and comparing the efficiency to their `Myo-lnc1` experiment.", "solution": "The goal is to determine whether the specific biological activity of the lncRNA sequence Myo-lnc1 is sufficient to drive fibroblast-to-myoblast reprogramming. A sufficiency test requires a gain-of-function approach with appropriate controls that isolate the effect of the specific sequence and structure of Myo-lnc1 from non-specific consequences of transfection, promoter activity, RNA abundance, vector backbone, and generic RNA-mediated effects.\n\nFirst, using a strong constitutive promoter to express Myo-lnc1 tests sufficiency by gain of function. To confirm that the observed induction of MyoD is due to the specific sequence-dependent function of Myo-lnc1 rather than non-specific artifacts, the most critical control must match all features of the experimental condition except the functional sequence. An empty vector control matches promoter strength and transfection conditions but lacks any RNA payload; this rules out promoter- or vector-driven artifacts but cannot exclude non-specific effects of RNA abundance or structure. Therefore, it is insufficiently specific.\n\nA scrambled RNA control that is the same length and has similar base composition, driven by the same promoter in the same vector context, controls for RNA expression level, length, GC content, potential generic RNA metabolism or innate immune responses, and the burden of RNA processing, while differing only in the primary sequence (and thus presumed secondary structure/function) that confers Myo-lnc1’s specific activity. If MyoD induction occurs only with Myo-lnc1 and not with the scrambled control, this supports that the sequence-specific activity of Myo-lnc1 is sufficient for reprogramming.\n\nDeleting the endogenous Myo-lnc1 locus in myoblasts tests necessity in the native context, not sufficiency in fibroblasts, and is therefore not the critical control for this particular claim. Measuring other muscle genes characterizes the phenotype but is not a control that isolates sequence-specific causality. Comparing to a chemical cocktail tests alternative routes and efficiency, not specificity of Myo-lnc1.\n\nTherefore, the most critical and specific control is transfecting a scrambled RNA of the same length and composition under the same promoter to isolate the sequence-specific function of Myo-lnc1.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2321545"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond qualitative understanding, modern biology often requires quantitative modeling to predict and engineer outcomes.

This advanced problem asks you to apply principles of chemical equilibrium and competitive binding to a therapeutic scenario, calculating the precise concentration of a synthetic \"decoy\" RNA needed to counteract the effects of an oncogenic lncRNA and restore normal cell function. [@problem_id:2321530]", "problem": "In a particular type of cancer cell, an oncogenic long non-coding RNA, designated `OncoLnc`, is overexpressed. `OncoLnc` functions by binding to the Embryonic Ectoderm Development (`EED`) subunit of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), recruiting it to the promoter of a critical tumor suppressor gene, `TSG1`. This recruitment leads to local histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and potent transcriptional silencing of `TSG1`.\n\nTo counteract this, a therapeutic strategy is developed using a synthetic, nuclease-resistant RNA mimic called `DecoyRNA`. This molecule is designed to bind to the same site on `EED` as `OncoLnc`, thereby acting as a competitive inhibitor. The relevant intracellular concentrations and binding affinities at equilibrium are as follows:\n\n-   Total intracellular concentration of the `EED` subunit, $[EED]_{\\text{total}}$ = 100 nM\n-   Total intracellular concentration of the oncogenic lncRNA, $[OncoLnc]_{\\text{total}}$ = 80 nM\n-   Dissociation constant for the `OncoLnc`-`EED` interaction, $K_{d, \\text{Onco}}$ = 20 nM\n-   Dissociation constant for the `DecoyRNA`-`EED` interaction, $K_{d, \\text{Decoy}}$ = 5 nM\n\nAssume that the transcriptional activity of `TSG1` is linearly and inversely related to the proportion of total `EED` protein that is bound by `OncoLnc`. Specifically, the fractional activity of `TSG1` (where 1.0 represents full, unsuppressed activity) is given by the expression: $1 - \\frac{[\\text{OncoLnc:EED}]}{[EED]_{\\text{total}}}$, where $[\\text{OncoLnc:EED}]$ is the concentration of the repressive complex.\n\nCalculate the total intracellular concentration of `DecoyRNA` that must be introduced to these cells to restore the transcriptional activity of `TSG1` to 50% of its maximal level.
