This exercise explores how a common, naturally occurring variation in the canonical polyadenylation signal (PAS) affects its processing efficiency. By working through this problem, you will develop a quantitative understanding of how subtle changes in the pre-mRNA sequence can directly regulate gene expression levels. [@problem_id:2314793]", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the process of generating a mature messenger RNA (mRNA) from a precursor-mRNA (pre-mRNA) involves several critical modifications. One such modification is the addition of a poly(A) tail to the 3' end, a process known as polyadenylation. This process is guided by a specific nucleotide sequence in the pre-mRNA known as the polyadenylation signal (PAS). The most common and efficient canonical PAS is the sequence AAUAAA.\n\nA researcher is studying a gene where a common Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) has altered the canonical PAS from AAUAAA to AUUAAA. Experimental data indicates that the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery processes pre-mRNA transcripts containing the AUUAAA signal with only 65% of the efficiency of transcripts that have the canonical AAUAAA signal.\n\nAssuming that the rate of transcription, the efficiency of all splicing events, the export of mature mRNA from the nucleus, the stability of the polyadenylated mRNA in the cytoplasm, and the rate of translation per mRNA molecule are all unaffected by this single nucleotide change, what is the most likely outcome for the production of functional protein from the gene with the AUUAAA signal compared to the gene with the canonical AAUAAA signal?\n\nA. The amount of functional protein will be approximately 65% of the original amount.\n\nB. The amount of functional protein will be significantly less than 65% of the original amount due to compounded negative effects on mRNA stability and translation.\n\nC. The amount of functional protein will not change, as the protein-coding sequence of the gene remains unaltered.\n\nD. The amount of functional protein will increase, as the AUUAAA variant is a known enhancer element in certain cellular contexts.\n\nE. No functional protein will be produced, as any mutation in the canonical PAS completely abolishes polyadenylation.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the effect of a mutation in the polyadenylation signal (PAS) on the final quantity of functional protein produced. We can solve this by tracing the steps of gene expression from transcription to translation and considering the impact of the specified change at each stage.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of pre-mRNA transcripts produced by transcription per unit time. The problem states that the rate of transcription is unaffected by the mutation, so $N$ is the same for both the gene with the canonical (AAUAAA) and the variant (AUUAAA) PAS.\n\nThe key step affected is the 3' end processing, specifically cleavage and polyadenylation.\nFor the canonical gene (AAUAAA), let's assume the processing efficiency is 100% (or some baseline efficiency $\\epsilon_{canonical}$). The number of mature, polyadenylated mRNA molecules produced is proportional to $N \\times \\epsilon_{canonical}$.\n\nFor the variant gene (AUUAAA), the problem states that the processing efficiency is 65% of the canonical efficiency. Therefore, the number of mature, polyadenylated mRNA molecules produced is proportional to $N \\times (0.65 \\times \\epsilon_{canonical})$.\nThis means that for every 100 pre-mRNA transcripts produced, only 65 will be successfully processed into mature mRNA, while the remaining 35 are likely degraded in the nucleus as they are not properly terminated.\n\nThe problem provides a crucial simplifying assumption: all subsequent steps are unaffected on a per-molecule basis. Let's analyze these steps:\n1.  **mRNA Export:** Only properly processed, mature mRNA is efficiently exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Since the amount of mature mRNA produced by the variant gene is 65% of the canonical gene, the amount of mRNA exported to the cytoplasm will also be 65% of the canonical amount.\n2.  **mRNA Stability:** The problem states that the stability of the polyadenylated mRNA is unaffected. This means that once an mRNA molecule is successfully polyadenylated and exported, its half-life in the cytoplasm is the same regardless of whether it came from a canonical or variant transcript.\n3.  **Translation Rate:** The problem states that the rate of translation *per mRNA molecule* is unchanged. This means that each individual mature mRNA molecule, once in the cytoplasm, will serve as a template for protein synthesis with the same efficiency.\n\nCombining these points, the total amount of protein synthesized is the product of the number of available mature mRNA templates and the translation rate per template. Since the number of mature mRNA templates in the cytoplasm for the variant gene is 65% of that for the canonical gene, and the translation rate per template is the same, the total amount of functional protein produced will be 65% of the amount produced by the canonical gene.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this reasoning:\n*   **A. The amount of functional protein will be approximately 65% of the original amount.** This matches our conclusion. The reduction in processing efficiency directly propagates to a proportional reduction in the final protein product, given the assumptions.\n*   **B. The amount of functional protein will be significantly less than 65%...** This is incorrect. It suggests a compounding effect, but the problem explicitly assumes that downstream processes like stability and translation rate per molecule are unaffected.\n*   **C. The amount of functional protein will not change...** This is incorrect. It ignores the critical role of non-coding regulatory sequences, like the PAS, in controlling gene expression levels.\n*   **D. The amount of functional protein will increase...** This contradicts the information given in the problem, which specifies a *reduction* in processing efficiency.\n*   **E. No functional protein will be produced...** This is incorrect. Biological signals are often not all-or-nothing. The problem states the efficiency is 65%, not 0%, indicating that processing still occurs, albeit less efficiently.\n\nTherefore, the only bottleneck introduced is the 3' processing step, which reduces the pool of mature mRNA to 65% of the normal level, leading directly to a 65% protein output.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2314793"}, {"introduction": "Having seen the importance of the polyadenylation signal sequence, we now turn our attention to the complex molecular machinery responsible for processing the 3' end of a pre-mRNA. This practice problem uses a hypothetical drug, Endocleavastatin, as a tool to dissect this intricate process. By inhibiting a specific enzymatic step—cleavage—you will uncover its critical role and its surprising connection to the termination of transcription itself, providing a deeper insight into how these fundamental events are coordinated. [@problem_id:2314836]", "problem": "In a molecular biology laboratory, a new synthetic compound named \"Endocleavastatin\" is being studied for its potential as a therapeutic agent. Cellular assays reveal that Endocleavastatin is a highly specific, non-competitive inhibitor of the endonuclease subunit of the eukaryotic Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF). The compound does not affect the ability of CPSF to recognize and bind to the canonical AAUAAA polyadenylation signal on a pre-mRNA transcript, nor does it inhibit the enzymatic activity of Poly(A) Polymerase (PAP).\n\nTo investigate the in-vivo consequences of this inhibition, researchers treat a culture of human HeLa cells with an effective concentration of Endocleavastatin. After several hours, they isolate total RNA from the nuclei of these cells for analysis. For the purposes of this problem, assume that the processes of transcription initiation, 5' capping, and pre-mRNA splicing are not affected by the drug treatment. Furthermore, recall that the standard model of transcription termination for RNA Polymerase II is tightly coupled to the cleavage of the nascent transcript at the polyadenylation site.\n\nWhich of the following descriptions best characterizes the predominant, anomalous form of a typical protein-coding pre-mRNA that would be expected to accumulate in the nucleus of these Endocleavastatin-treated cells?\n\nA. Transcripts that are 5' capped and spliced, but extend hundreds or thousands of nucleotides beyond the normal polyadenylation signal site and lack a poly(A) tail.\n\nB. No significant accumulation of specific gene transcripts, as the drug causes premature transcription termination immediately upon recognition of the polyadenylation signal by the inhibited CPSF complex.\n\nC.

Full-length, mature mRNAs (5' capped, spliced, and polyadenylated) that are unable to be exported from the nucleus.\n\nF. An accumulation of small, degraded RNA fragments corresponding to the 5' end of transcripts, resulting from exonucleolytic decay initiated at the stalled 3' processing complex.", "solution": "The drug is a non-competitive inhibitor of the endonuclease subunit of CPSF, and it does not impair CPSF recognition of the AAUAAA signal. Therefore, CPSF still binds the polyadenylation signal on the pre-mRNA but cannot catalyze the endonucleolytic cleavage at the polyadenylation site. Poly(A) Polymerase (PAP) requires the free 3' hydroxyl generated by this cleavage on the upstream RNA fragment in order to add a poly(A) tail; without cleavage, there is no suitable substrate terminus for PAP, so polyadenylation cannot occur despite PAP being catalytically competent.\n\nIn the standard model for RNA Polymerase II transcription termination, cleavage at the polyadenylation site is tightly coupled to termination via the torpedo mechanism: after cleavage, the downstream RNA is degraded by a 5' to 3' exonuclease (e.g., Xrn2), which catches up to RNA Polymerase II and promotes termination. If cleavage does not occur, there is no entry site for the exonuclease, so RNA Polymerase II fails to terminate at the normal site and instead continues transcription beyond the polyadenylation signal (readthrough). Because 5' capping and splicing are unaffected, the transcripts will be capped and spliced but will remain uncleaved at the normal polyadenylation site, lack a poly(A) tail, and extend hundreds to thousands of nucleotides beyond the canonical site. Such improperly processed transcripts are expected to accumulate in the nucleus due to quality control and export dependency on proper 3' end formation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A matches the predicted outcome: capped and spliced transcripts that read through beyond the polyadenylation site and lack a poly(A) tail.\n- B is incorrect because inhibition of cleavage impairs, rather than promotes, termination; it causes readthrough, not premature termination.\n- C is incorrect because PAP cannot add a poly(A) tail internally without the requisite cleaved 3' end; PAP does not synthesize internal poly(A) tracts on an intact transcript.\n- D is incorrect because cleavage is specifically blocked; correctly cleaved transcripts should not predominate.\n- E is incorrect because the transcripts fail cleavage and polyadenylation, so they are not mature mRNAs; export defects are secondary but not the defining feature.\n- F is incorrect because, without cleavage, there is no 5' end created downstream to initiate the torpedo exonuclease that would generate small 5' fragments as predominant species.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2314836"}, {"introduction": "Our deep understanding of molecular mechanisms like polyadenylation opens the door to developing novel therapeutic strategies.
