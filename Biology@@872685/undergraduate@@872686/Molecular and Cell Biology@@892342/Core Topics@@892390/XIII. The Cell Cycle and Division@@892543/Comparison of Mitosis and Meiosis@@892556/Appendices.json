In G1, the number of chromosomes equals the diploid number:\n$$C_{\\text{G1}}=2n=28.$$\n\nB. A primary spermatocyte is a diploid cell that has completed S phase and is entering meiosis I. After S phase, each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids, so the number of DNA molecules (each chromatid corresponds to one DNA double helix) doubles relative to G1. Thus, the chromosome count remains $2n$, but the DNA molecule count is $4n$:\n$$D_{\\text{primary spermatocyte}}=4n=56.$$\n\nC. A secondary oocyte is produced after meiosis I, in which homologous chromosomes segregate into different cells.

A human diploid cell has $2n=46$ chromosomes; thus $46$ individual chromosomes, each composed of two sister chromatids, align independently.\n- In meiosis I (metaphase I), homologous chromosomes pair to form tetrads (bivalents); therefore, there are $n=23$ aligned structures, each a homologous pair (tetrad), with two chromosomes (four chromatids) per structure.\n\nTherefore:\n- Cell A is in metaphase of mitosis (because it shows $46$ individually aligned replicated chromosomes).\n- Cell B is in metaphase I of meiosis (because it shows $23$ tetrads/bivalents).\n\nNow determine the outcomes upon completion of the respective full division processes.\n\nFor Cell A (mitosis):\n- Anaphase separates sister chromatids, distributing one chromatid from each chromosome to opposite poles.\n- Telophase and cytokinesis produce two daughter cells, each with the same chromosome number as the parent, i.e., $2n=46$. Immediately after division, each chromosome consists of a single chromatid; after S phase in the next cycle, chromosomes will replicate again.\n- The two daughter cells are genetically identical to each other (barring mutation), because mitosis preserves the genome without recombination or independent assortment.\n\nFor Cell B (meiosis, starting at metaphase I):\n- Anaphase I separates homologous chromosomes; sister chromatids remain together.\n- Telophase I and cytokinesis produce two cells that are haploid in chromosome set (each has $n=23$ chromosomes), but each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids.\n- Meiosis II then separates sister chromatids, producing a total of four haploid cells, each with $n=23$ chromosomes, each chromosome now consisting of a single chromatid.\n- Due to independent assortment and crossing over in meiosis I, the final products are genetically distinct from each other.\n\nEvaluate each statement:\n- A: False. Mitosis yields diploid daughters with $2n=46$, not haploid $23$.\n- B: False. Meiosis yields haploid products; not diploid $46$.\n- C: True. Mitosis (Cell A) produces genetically identical daughters; meiosis (Cell B), after its full process, produces genetically distinct haploid cells.\n- D: False. Mitosis produces two cells; meiosis produces four.\n- E: False. After the immediate next anaphase and telophase from metaphase I (i.e., after meiosis I), each daughter has $23$ chromosomes, each still with two sister chromatids, not a single chromatid.\n\nThus, only statement C is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2287887"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice presents a deductive reasoning puzzle that integrates the concepts we've covered so far.

This challenge sharpens your analytical skills by forcing a direct comparison between the subtle yet critical differences in mitotic anaphase and meiotic anaphase II.", "problem": "A biologist is studying the cell division processes in a newly discovered species of crustacean. Through karyotyping of its somatic cells, the organism is determined to have a diploid chromosome number of 24 (2n = 24). While examining prepared tissue samples from the organism's gonad, the biologist identifies a cell in a specific stage of division. The key feature of this cell is that structures that were once sister chromatids have separated and are actively migrating to opposite poles of the cell. A careful count reveals a total of 24 of these newly separated chromosomes within the single dividing cell.\n\nBased on this complete set of information, which of the following statements is the correct identification of the cellular process and its outcome?\n\nA. The cell is in anaphase of mitosis, and its daughter cells will be diploid with 24 chromosomes each.\n\nB. The cell is in anaphase I of meiosis, and its daughter cells will be haploid with 12 chromosomes each.\n\nC. The cell is in anaphase II of meiosis, and the resulting cells will be haploid with 12 chromosomes each.\n\nD. The cell is in anaphase of mitosis, and its daughter cells will be haploid with 12 chromosomes each.\n\nE. The cell is in anaphase II of meiosis, and the resulting cells will be diploid with 24 chromosomes each.", "solution": "The organism’s diploid chromosome number is given as $2n=24$, which implies the haploid number is $n=12$.\n\nKey cytological principle: chromosome number refers to the number of centromeres. Sister chromatids count as one chromosome before separation; once sister chromatids separate at anaphase, each chromatid becomes an independent chromosome, doubling the chromosome count within the single cell during that phase.\n\nThe observation states that structures that were once sister chromatids have separated and are moving to opposite poles. This excludes anaphase I of meiosis, because in anaphase I homologous chromosomes separate while sister chromatids remain together. Therefore, the stage must be either anaphase of mitosis or anaphase II of meiosis.\n\nNow compare expected chromosome counts within a single cell at anaphase:\n- In anaphase of mitosis for a diploid cell with $2n=24$, separation of sister chromatids yields $48$ chromosomes transiently within the cell. This contradicts the observed count of $24$ separated chromosomes.\n- In anaphase II of meiosis, each cell entering meiosis II is haploid with $n=12$ chromosomes (each still composed of sister chromatids). When sister chromatids separate in anaphase II, the number of chromosomes within that single cell becomes $24$ (each former chromatid now an independent chromosome), matching the observation.\n\nTherefore, the dividing cell is in anaphase II of meiosis. The products of meiosis II are haploid, each with $n=12$ chromosomes.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A is incorrect because mitotic anaphase would show $48$ chromosomes within the cell at that moment, not $24$.\n- B is incorrect because anaphase I does not involve separation of sister chromatids.\n- C is correct: anaphase II with resulting haploid cells of $12$ chromosomes each.\n- D is incorrect because mitosis does not produce haploid daughter cells.\n- E is incorrect because meiosis II produces haploid, not diploid, cells.\n\nHence, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2310412"}]}
