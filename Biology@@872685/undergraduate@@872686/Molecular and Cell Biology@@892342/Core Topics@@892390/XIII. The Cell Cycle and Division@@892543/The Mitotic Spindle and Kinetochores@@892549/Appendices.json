This exercise challenges you to think like a cell biologist and predict the consequences of disrupting this balance. By considering a hypothetical scenario of kinesin-13 overexpression, you will explore how the regulated activity of microtubule-depolymerizing proteins is essential for constructing a spindle of the correct size and stability [@problem_id:2343010].", "problem": "The formation of the bipolar mitotic spindle is a complex and highly regulated process essential for accurate chromosome segregation. This structure is primarily composed of microtubules, which are dynamic polymers that can grow (polymerize) and shrink (depolymerize). The balance between these two activities is controlled by a variety of microtubule-associated proteins. One such protein is kinesin-13, a unique member of the kinesin superfamily that does not function as a typical motor protein but rather acts as a potent adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent microtubule depolymerase. It plays a crucial role in regulating microtubule length and dynamics throughout mitosis.\n\nImagine a cell biologist has created a genetically modified cell line in which the gene encoding kinesin-13 is constitutively overexpressed, leading to a significant surplus of the kinesin-13 protein within the cytoplasm. Based on the known function of kinesin-13, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the primary consequence for this cell line as it attempts to undergo mitosis?\n\nA. The cells will form a hyper-elongated mitotic spindle with exceptionally long and stable microtubules, ultimately causing a failure in cytokinesis.\n\nB. The cells will exhibit an accelerated progression through prometaphase and metaphase, leading to a higher rate of aneuploidy due to premature sister chromatid separation.\n\nC. The cells will fail to form a stable, bipolar spindle of appropriate size; instead, they will likely exhibit very short spindles or a collapse of microtubule structures, resulting in a cell cycle arrest prior to anaphase.\n\nD. The cells will display hyper-stabilized kinetochore-microtubule attachments that cannot be resolved, preventing the proper segregation of chromosomes during anaphase due to an inability to depolymerize the microtubules at the kinetochore.\n\nE. The cells will frequently form multipolar spindles due to the abnormal duplication of centrosomes, leading to catastrophic chromosome mis-segregation.", "solution": "Kinesin-13 family proteins (e.g., MCAK/KIF2) are ATP-dependent microtubule depolymerases that act at microtubule ends to increase catastrophe frequency and drive depolymerization. During mitosis, spindle assembly and maintenance require a balance between tubulin polymerization and depolymerization, with proper microtubule length and stability needed for a robust, bipolar spindle and stable kinetochore-microtubule attachments. \n\nIf kinesin-13 is constitutively overexpressed, the balance shifts strongly toward depolymerization. The immediate mechanistic consequences are:\n- Increased catastrophe and reduced microtubule length throughout the spindle.\n- Destabilization of kinetochore-microtubule attachments, leading to persistent unattached or improperly attached kinetochores.\n- Failure to achieve or maintain a spindle of appropriate length and rigidity, with a tendency toward very short spindles or spindle collapse.\n- Activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint due to unattached or tensionless kinetochores, causing arrest before anaphase rather than accelerated progression.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because overexpression of a depolymerase would not produce hyper-elongated, stable microtubules; the effect would be the opposite.\n- B is incorrect because destabilized attachments activate the spindle checkpoint, delaying rather than accelerating progression; premature sister chromatid separation is not the expected outcome of excessive depolymerization.\n- C is correct: excess depolymerization yields short or collapsed spindles and pre-anaphase arrest.\n- D is incorrect because overexpression would not hyper-stabilize attachments; it would destabilize them, impairing proper segregation but primarily by preventing stable biorientation rather than by inability to depolymerize.\n- E is not the primary predicted outcome; multipolar spindles arise from centrosome amplification or pole fragmentation, which is not the direct, primary effect of kinesin-13 overexpression.\n\nTherefore, the best prediction is failure to form a stable, appropriately sized bipolar spindle with resultant arrest prior to anaphase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2343010"}, {"introduction": "Once a bipolar spindle is assembled, it must be correctly positioned and oriented within the cell to ensure that division occurs along the proper axis. This process relies on forces generated at the cell periphery. This problem asks you to analyze the specific role of astral microtubules and the motor protein dynein at the cell cortex, helping you understand the elegant mechanism cells use to control the spindle's spatial arrangement [@problem_id:2343002].", "problem": "In a cell biology experiment, a line of animal cells is genetically engineered to eliminate the function of a specific protein complex that anchors the motor protein dynein to the cell cortex, the specialized layer of cytoplasm on the inner face of the plasma membrane. All other functions of dynein, such as its roles at the kinetochore and in intracellular transport, remain intact. Furthermore, the machinery for microtubule polymerization and depolymerization, as well as all other motor proteins like kinesins, are unaffected.\n\nGiven this specific molecular defect, which of the following options describes the most direct and primary consequence for the process of mitosis in these cells?\n\nA. Chromosomes will fail to congress to the center of the cell, preventing the formation of a stable metaphase plate.\n\nB.

The bipolar spindle itself will fail to form, resulting in a monopolar arrangement of chromosomes.", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the primary defect in mitosis in a cell where the motor protein dynein cannot be anchored to the cell cortex. To solve this, we must understand the structure of the mitotic spindle and the specific role of cortical dynein.\n\nFirst, let's break down the mitotic spindle. It is composed of microtubules organized by two centrosomes, which form the spindle poles. There are three main classes of microtubules in the spindle:\n1.  **Kinetochore microtubules**: These attach to chromosomes at a structure called the kinetochore and are responsible for pulling chromosomes.\n2.  **Interpolar (or polar) microtubules**: These extend from each pole and overlap in the middle of the spindle. They are involved in pushing the poles apart.\n3.  **Astral microtubules**: These radiate outward from the spindle poles towards the cell periphery, or cell cortex.\n\nMotor proteins, such as dyneins and kinesins, \"walk\" along these microtubule tracks to generate forces that drive mitotic events. Dyneins are minus-end directed motors, meaning they move toward the minus ends of microtubules. In the spindle, the minus ends of all microtubules are located at the spindle poles (the centrosomes).\n\nThe problem states that dynein is specifically unable to anchor at the cell cortex. This implicates the function of astral microtubules, as they are the ones that interact with the cortex. Cortically-anchored dynein motors bind to the plus ends of astral microtubules and attempt to walk towards their minus ends (located at the spindle poles). This action generates a pulling force on the astral microtubules, effectively pulling the entire spindle pole towards the cortex.\n\nThe collective action of these pulling forces across the cell periphery is crucial for two main functions:\n1.  **Spindle Positioning**: The balance of pulling forces from different regions of the cortex positions the spindle within the cell. In a symmetrically dividing cell, equal forces from all sides center the spindle. In asymmetric division, a higher concentration of active cortical dynein on one side pulls the spindle towards it.\n2.  **Spindle Orientation**: These forces also orient the spindle along a specific axis, which in turn determines the plane of cell division and the subsequent positioning of the daughter cells.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consequence of losing this cortically-anchored dynein function. Without the anchoring, the pulling forces on the astral microtubules from the cell cortex are eliminated. The spindle can still form because centrosome separation (driven by kinesin-5 on interpolar microtubules) and chromosome capture (by kinetochore microtubules) are unaffected. However, the mechanism for positioning and orienting the fully formed spindle within the cell is lost. The spindle may drift randomly within the cytoplasm or fail to align with the intended division axis.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options in light of this understanding:\n\n*   **A. Failure of chromosome congression...**: Chromosome congression to the metaphase plate is primarily mediated by forces acting at the kinetochores, involving both kinesins and dyneins on the kinetochore microtubules. This process is independent of the cortical interaction of astral microtubules. The problem states that kinetochore dynein function is normal. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n*   **B. The mitotic spindle will form but will be improperly positioned and/or oriented...**: This matches our analysis perfectly. The loss of cortical pulling forces directly impairs the cell's ability to control the location and orientation of the spindle. This is the primary and most direct consequence.\n*   **C. Sister chromatids will fail to separate...**: The separation of sister chromatids is triggered by the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), which leads to the cleavage of the cohesin proteins holding them together. This is a biochemical signaling event, not directly related to mechanical forces from the cell cortex. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n*   **D. Kinetochore microtubules will be unable to shorten...**: The shortening (depolymerization) of kinetochore microtubules during anaphase A is a complex process driven by depolymerizing enzymes and motor proteins at the kinetochore and spindle pole. It does not depend on dynein at the cell cortex. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n*   **E. The bipolar spindle itself will fail to form...**: The initial separation of duplicated centrosomes to form a bipolar spindle is primarily driven by plus-end directed kinesin-5 motors acting on the antiparallel interpolar microtubules, pushing the poles apart. This is independent of cortical dynein. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the most direct consequence of disabling cortical dynein anchoring is the loss of control over spindle position and orientation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2343002"}, {"introduction": "To prevent catastrophic errors in chromosome segregation, cells have evolved a sophisticated surveillance system called the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC). This checkpoint acts as a quality control mechanism, delaying cell division until every chromosome is properly attached to the spindle. This practice delves into the molecular logic of the SAC, asking you to explain why a specific type of attachment error maintains the checkpoint signal, thereby revealing the crucial role of physical tension in satisfying the checkpoint [@problem_id:2343017].", "problem": "During mitosis in a eukaryotic cell, the accurate segregation of chromosomes is monitored by a surveillance mechanism known as the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC). This checkpoint ensures that anaphase does not commence until all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle in a bipolar, or \"amphitelic,\" fashion. Consider a specific error where a single chromosome achieves a \"syntelic attachment,\" meaning both of its sister kinetochores become attached to microtubules originating from the same spindle pole. This incorrect configuration fails to satisfy the SAC, meaning the checkpoint remains active and delays the onset of anaphase.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate molecular reason for why a syntelic attachment maintains an active checkpoint signal?\n\nA. The lack of tension across the sister kinetochores prevents the kinetochore-associated checkpoint proteins from being silenced, leading to continued inhibition of the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C).\n\nB. Since both kinetochores are attached to microtubules, the checkpoint machinery is partially satisfied, allowing for a weak, but ultimately insufficient, activation of the APC/C.\n\nC. The syntelic attachment is inherently unstable and the kinetochores frequently detach from microtubules, which is interpreted by the SAC as a completely unattached chromosome.\n\nD. A syntelic attachment prevents the phosphorylation of the protein Securin, which is the direct signal required to satisfy the SAC and initiate anaphase.\n\nE. The physical proximity of the two sister kinetochores in a syntelic attachment causes a steric hindrance that blocks the recruitment of motor proteins necessary for silencing the checkpoint.", "solution": "The Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) inhibits APC/C activation via the mitotic checkpoint complex when kinetochores are not in the proper state. Proper silencing of the SAC requires two key molecular criteria at each kinetochore: end-on microtubule attachment that displaces Mps1 and Mad1–Mad2 from the Ndc80 complex, and tension across sister kinetochores that spatially separates kinetochore substrates from Aurora B kinase and promotes recruitment of phosphatase PP1 to KNL1, thereby dephosphorylating MELT motifs and releasing Bub proteins to stop further checkpoint signaling.\n\nIn a syntelic attachment, both sister kinetochores attach to microtubules from the same pole. This configuration lacks inter-kinetochore tension because sister kinetochores are pulled in the same direction rather than opposing directions. Without tension, Aurora B continues to phosphorylate outer kinetochore substrates (including Ndc80 and KNL1), which inhibits the stable recruitment of PP1 and prevents the full removal of checkpoint proteins (Mad1–Mad2, Bub1–Bub3–BubR1) from the kinetochore. As a result, the kinetochore continues to generate the mitotic checkpoint complex, maintaining inhibition of APC/C and delaying anaphase onset.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate molecular reason is that the lack of tension across sister kinetochores in a syntelic attachment prevents SAC silencing and sustains APC/C inhibition.\n\nOption A states precisely this mechanism. Option B is incorrect because mere attachment without proper tension does not weakly activate APC/C; instead, the SAC remains active. Option C is not the most accurate, as the checkpoint is primarily maintained due to unsilenced kinetochore signaling rather than frequent detachment alone. Option D is incorrect because securin phosphorylation is not the SAC satisfaction signal; securin degradation is downstream of APC/C activation. Option E is not supported; steric hindrance of motor proteins is not the canonical mechanism for SAC maintenance in syntelic attachments.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2343017"}]}
