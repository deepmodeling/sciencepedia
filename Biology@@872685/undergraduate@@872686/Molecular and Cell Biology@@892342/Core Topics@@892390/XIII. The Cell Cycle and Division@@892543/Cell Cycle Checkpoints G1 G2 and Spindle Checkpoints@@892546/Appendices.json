This exercise explores the role of the Retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a critical tumor suppressor that acts as a gatekeeper for S phase entry. By analyzing a hypothetical scenario involving the loss of Rb function, you will develop a deeper understanding of how internal cell cycle regulators respond to external growth signals. [@problem_id:2307286]", "problem": "In vertebrate cells, progression from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle is controlled by a critical checkpoint known as the restriction point. This checkpoint ensures that cells only replicate their DNA when appropriate external growth signals are present. A key regulator of this checkpoint is the Retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, a tumor suppressor. In its active, hypophosphorylated state, Rb binds to and sequesters the E2F family of transcription factors, preventing them from activating the genes required for S phase entry. When a cell is stimulated by growth factors, specific Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs) phosphorylate Rb. This phosphorylation inactivates Rb, causing it to release E2F, which then drives the cell into S phase.\n\nConsider a human fibroblast cell line that has a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in its *RB1* gene, meaning it produces no functional Rb protein. These mutant cells are cultured in a medium completely lacking any growth factors.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes most accurately describes the immediate cell cycle progression of these mutant fibroblasts under these conditions?\n\nA. The cells will arrest in the G1 phase because the absence of growth factors prevents the activation of S-phase-promoting CDKs.\n\nB. The cells will undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) immediately upon failing to detect growth factors.\n\nC. The cells will proceed through the G1 phase and enter the S phase.\n\nD. The cells will arrest at the G2/M checkpoint due to genomic instability caused by the mutation.\n\nE. The cells will permanently exit the cell cycle and enter a state of senescence (G0 phase).", "solution": "The restriction point in G1 is governed by the Rb–E2F axis. In normal cells without growth factors, cyclin D–CDK4/6 is not activated, so Rb remains hypophosphorylated and active, binds E2F, and prevents transcription of S-phase genes, resulting in G1 arrest. When growth factors are present, cyclin D–CDK4/6 phosphorylates Rb, inactivating it and releasing E2F, which induces genes such as cyclin E and cyclin A to drive G1/S progression.\n\nIn the mutant fibroblasts described, there is a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in RB1, so no functional Rb protein is present. Therefore, E2F is not sequestered by Rb and is free to activate transcription of S-phase genes irrespective of upstream mitogenic signaling. This constitutive E2F activity can induce cyclin E and cyclin A expression and activate CDK2, thereby bypassing the need for growth factor–dependent Rb phosphorylation at the restriction point. Consequently, these cells do not arrest in G1 in response to growth factor deprivation but instead proceed through G1 and enter S phase. Immediate apoptosis, G2/M arrest, or permanent senescence are not the direct immediate outcomes dictated by the loss of Rb at the G1 restriction point under these conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2307286"}, {"introduction": "Before a cell commits to the dramatic process of mitosis, the G2/M checkpoint serves as a final quality control inspection, primarily scanning for DNA damage. This practice problem illustrates the direct physical consequences of bypassing this checkpoint after DNA has been damaged. You will connect the abstract concept of a double-strand break to a concrete, observable chromosomal defect in anaphase, highlighting why this checkpoint is essential for maintaining genomic stability. [@problem_id:2307337]", "problem": "In a cell biology research project, a population of actively dividing eukaryotic cells is treated with a compound that inhibits the G2/M checkpoint, effectively allowing cells to enter mitosis regardless of their DNA integrity. The cells are also exposed to a low dose of an agent that induces a small number of random, double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the chromosomes.\n\nAn investigator isolates a single cell that has just entered mitosis. It is determined that this cell experienced exactly one DSB during the G2 phase. The break occurred on the long arm of one of its chromosomes, not near the centromere or telomeres. What is the most likely visible chromosomal abnormality that will be observed in this specific cell as it progresses into anaphase?\n\nA.

The entire chromosome that sustained the break will fail to attach to the spindle and will drift randomly in the cytoplasm.\n\nE. All sister chromatids will separate from each other prematurely during metaphase, before the anaphase promoting complex is activated.", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the direct consequence of an unrepaired double-strand break (DSB) occurring in G2, followed by a forced entry into mitosis, specifically observing the cell during anaphase.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the state of the chromosome in G2.**\nThe cell cycle proceeds from G1 to S to G2 and then to M (mitosis). During the S phase, DNA replication occurs. Therefore, a cell in the G2 phase has chromosomes that have already been duplicated. Each chromosome consists of two identical sister chromatids, which are joined together at a region called the centromere.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the effect of the double-strand break.**\nThe problem states that a single DSB occurs on the long arm of one chromosome during the G2 phase. This means the break happens *after* DNA replication. The break will therefore affect only *one* of the two sister chromatids. This break severs the chromatid into two pieces:\n1.  A larger piece that includes the centromere.\n2.  A smaller, acentric fragment (a piece without a centromere) corresponding to the end of the chromosome arm.\nThe other sister chromatid of the same chromosome remains intact.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the progression into mitosis.**\nThe cell bypasses the G2/M checkpoint and enters mitosis. The chromosomes condense during prophase and align at the metaphase plate during metaphase. The damaged chromosome aligns along with the others. At this point, it is structurally composed of one intact chromatid and one broken chromatid, both linked at the centromere.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the events of anaphase.**\nAnaphase is characterized by the separation of sister chromatids. The cohesin proteins holding them together are cleaved. Microtubules from the spindle poles attach to kinetochores, which are protein structures assembled at the centromeres. The microtubules then pull the separated chromatids to opposite poles of the cell.\n\nLet's trace the fate of the parts of the damaged chromosome:\n*   The intact sister chromatid has a centromere, so it is pulled normally to one spindle pole.\n*   The piece of the broken chromatid that is still attached to the centromere is also pulled normally, along with the intact chromatid's centromere, to the other spindle pole.\n*   The acentric fragment, however, lacks a centromere. Without a centromere, it cannot form a kinetochore, and therefore spindle microtubules cannot attach to it. As a result, this fragment is not segregated to either pole. It is left behind in the middle of the cell, near the position of the former metaphase plate. This is referred to as a \"lagging\" fragment.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the given options.**\n*   **A:** Failure of homologous chromosomes to separate is a hallmark of errors in meiosis I, not mitosis. Nondisjunction in mitosis involves the failure of sister chromatids to separate. In either case, this is not the direct result of a DSB but rather an issue with spindle function or chromatid cohesion, often caught by the spindle checkpoint. This option is incorrect.\n*   **B:** This option describes an acentric fragment lagging at the cell's equator. As derived in Step 4, this is the precise and most direct consequence of an unrepaired DSB on a chromatid arm in G2. This option is correct.\n*   **C:** The fusion of two non-homologous chromosomes describes a translocation. While this can be a result of faulty DSB repair, it is not the immediate consequence of a single, unrepaired break. A bridge that breaks is typically a dicentric chromosome (a chromosome with two centromeres), which might form from other types of DNA damage or repair errors (e.g., fusion of two broken chromosome ends). This is not the most direct outcome described. This option is incorrect.\n*   **D:** The entire chromosome would not be lost. The centromere is intact and attached to one of the chromatids (and part of the other). The kinetochore will form at this centromere, allowing spindle attachment. Only the part of the chromosome that is physically severed from the centromere (the acentric fragment) will be unable to segregate properly. This option is incorrect.\n*   **E:** Premature separation of all sister chromatids is a condition known as cohesion failure. This is a global problem affecting all chromosomes and is related to the proteins that hold chromatids together, not a localized DSB. This option is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most likely observable abnormality is the presence of an acentric fragment left behind during anaphase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2307337"}, {"introduction": "The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) provides a high-fidelity mechanism to ensure that every daughter cell inherits the correct number of chromosomes. This problem presents a scenario where the SAC fails, allowing cell division to proceed despite a critical error in chromosome attachment to the mitotic spindle.

Before mitosis begins, the cell undergoes the S phase of the cell cycle, where its DNA is replicated. After replication, the cell still contains 8 chromosomes, but each chromosome is now composed of two identical sister chromatids joined at the centromere.\n\n**Step 2: Describe a normal mitotic division.**\nIn a normal mitosis, the 8 replicated chromosomes align at the metaphase plate. The spindle assembly checkpoint ensures that each pair of sister chromatids is attached to microtubules from opposite poles. Once this is confirmed, the cell enters anaphase. During anaphase, the sister chromatids separate. The 8 chromatids from each chromosome pair are pulled to opposite poles. Thus, 8 chromatids (which are now considered individual chromosomes) move to one pole, and 8 chromosomes move to the opposite pole. The cell then divides via cytokinesis, producing two genetically identical daughter cells, each with a diploid number of 8 chromosomes.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the specified error and checkpoint failure.**\nIn this scenario, the spindle assembly checkpoint fails. This allows the cell to enter anaphase despite an attachment error affecting one of the 8 chromosomes. For this one specific chromosome, both sister chromatids are attached to the same spindle pole. The other 7 chromosomes are attached correctly.\n\n**Step 4: Trace the segregation of chromosomes during anaphase.**\nWhen anaphase begins, the following events occur:\n- For the 7 correctly attached chromosomes, the sister chromatids separate as normal. This means 7 chromatids move toward one spindle pole (let's call it Pole A) and 7 chromatids move toward the other spindle pole (Pole B).\n- For the 1 incorrectly attached chromosome, both of its sister chromatids are pulled together to the same pole they are attached to (Pole A). The other pole (Pole B) receives no part of this chromosome.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the chromosome count for each forming nucleus.**\nLet's tally the number of chromatids that arrive at each pole at the end of anaphase. In cytology, once sister chromatids separate during anaphase, each is considered a full-fledged chromosome.\n- **Pole A receives:** 7 chromosomes (from the normally separating pairs) + 2 chromosomes (the two sister chromatids from the non-disjoined pair). The total number of chromosomes moving to Pole A is $7 + 2 = 9$.\n- **Pole B receives:** 7 chromosomes (from the normally separating pairs) + 0 chromosomes (from the non-disjoined pair). The total number of chromosomes moving to Pole B is $7 + 0 = 7$.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the chromosome number of the final daughter cells.**\nAfter anaphase, telophase and cytokinesis occur, dividing the cell into two. The chromosomes that collected at each pole form the nucleus of a new daughter cell.\n- The daughter cell formed from the contents of Pole A will have 9 chromosomes. This condition is known as trisomy (2n+1).\n- The daughter cell formed from the contents of Pole B will have 7 chromosomes. This condition is known as monosomy (2n-1).\n\nTherefore, the two resulting daughter cells will have chromosome numbers of 9 and 7.
