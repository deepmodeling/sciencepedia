## Introduction
Following the segregation of chromosomes, a cell faces its final tasks: concluding nuclear division and physically partitioning itself into two distinct daughter cells. These processes, known as [telophase](@entry_id:169480) and cytokinesis, represent a highly regulated transition from the dramatic upheaval of [mitosis](@entry_id:143192) back to the functional state of [interphase](@entry_id:157879). Far from being a simple conclusion, this stage involves the systematic disassembly of mitotic structures and the precise re-establishment of cellular architecture, ensuring that each new cell is viable and genetically identical to the parent. This article addresses how a cell orchestrates this complex reversal, dismantling the very machinery that drove it into division. Across the following chapters, you will explore the intricate molecular events that define these final stages. Chapter one, "Principles and Mechanisms," will dissect the core molecular machinery and regulatory switches that govern nuclear reassembly and cytoplasmic division. Chapter two, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections," will broaden this view to see how these mechanisms are adapted across different life forms and connected to disease, physics, and development. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will challenge you to apply this knowledge in experimental scenarios, solidifying your understanding of this fundamental biological process.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Following the dramatic segregation of [sister chromatids](@entry_id:273764) during [anaphase](@entry_id:165003), the cell enters the final stages of division: [telophase](@entry_id:169480) and [cytokinesis](@entry_id:144612). Telophase marks the conclusion of nuclear division ([mitosis](@entry_id:143192)), while cytokinesis accomplishes the physical separation of the cytoplasm to create two independent daughter cells. These processes are not merely a conclusion but a highly orchestrated transition, dismantling the mitotic machinery and meticulously re-establishing the functional architecture of [interphase](@entry_id:157879) cells. This chapter will dissect the principles and molecular mechanisms governing these terminal events of cell division.

### Telophase: Restoring the Interphase Nucleus

Telophase can be understood as the systematic reversal of the events that initiated mitosis in [prophase](@entry_id:170157) and [prometaphase](@entry_id:174947). As the two sets of daughter chromosomes arrive at opposite poles of the spindle, the cell begins to reverse the profound structural changes that facilitated [chromosome segregation](@entry_id:144865). The initiation of [telophase](@entry_id:169480) is cytologically marked by the first visible signs of chromosome decondensation, where the tightly coiled mitotic chromosomes begin to unfurl into a more diffuse state [@problem_id:2324886].

This transition involves several hallmark events that mirror and reverse those of [prophase](@entry_id:170157) [@problem_id:2324843]:

1.  **Chromosome Decondensation:** The compact mitotic chromosomes uncoil and relax, returning to their dispersed interphase form known as chromatin. This process is essential for the resumption of cellular function. The highly condensed state, while perfect for segregation, renders the DNA inaccessible. Decondensation is a prerequisite for the transcriptional machinery to access gene [promoters](@entry_id:149896) and [enhancers](@entry_id:140199), allowing the newly formed daughter cells to synthesize the RNAs and proteins necessary for growth and metabolism in the subsequent G1 phase [@problem_id:2324834].

2.  **Nuclear Envelope Reformation:** A new [nuclear envelope](@entry_id:136792) assembles around each set of segregated chromosomes, re-establishing the boundary between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This is a direct reversal of the [nuclear envelope breakdown](@entry_id:177901) that occurred during [prometaphase](@entry_id:174947).

3.  **Nucleolus Reappearance:** The [nucleolus](@entry_id:168439), the site of ribosome synthesis which disappears during [prophase](@entry_id:170157), reappears within each newly formed nucleus. This signifies the re-initiation of [ribosome biogenesis](@entry_id:175219), a critical activity for cell growth.

4.  **Mitotic Spindle Disassembly:** The [microtubule](@entry_id:165292)-based mitotic spindle, having completed its function of [chromosome segregation](@entry_id:144865), is disassembled.

The coordinated execution of these events ensures that each daughter cell receives a complete genome enclosed within a functional nucleus, ready to commence the next phase of the cell cycle.

### Molecular Mechanisms of Nuclear Reassembly

The reformation of the nucleus is a complex architectural process governed by precise [biochemical switches](@entry_id:191763). The reassembly of the [nuclear envelope](@entry_id:136792), in particular, provides a clear example of how mitotic regulatory signals are reversed to drive cellular reconstruction.

The structural integrity of the [nuclear envelope](@entry_id:136792) is dependent on the **[nuclear lamina](@entry_id:138734)**, a meshwork of [intermediate filaments](@entry_id:140996) called **lamins** that underlies the inner nuclear membrane. The assembly state of this lamina is directly controlled by reversible phosphorylation. During [prophase](@entry_id:170157), Mitosis-Promoting Factor (MPF), a complex of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1 ($CDK1$) and Cyclin B, phosphorylates [lamin proteins](@entry_id:169994). This phosphorylation induces conformational changes that cause the lamin filaments to depolymerize, leading to the breakdown of the nuclear envelope. The exit from mitosis requires the reversal of this process. As mitotic activity wanes, specific [protein phosphatases](@entry_id:178718), such as Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1), become active and remove the phosphate groups from the lamins. This **[dephosphorylation](@entry_id:175330) of [nuclear lamins](@entry_id:166158)** is the direct biochemical trigger that allows them to repolymerize on the surface of the segregated chromosomes, initiating the reassembly of the [nuclear lamina](@entry_id:138734) and, consequently, the nuclear envelope [@problem_id:2324853].

A key question in this process is the origin of the membranes and proteins that form the new envelope. Rather than being synthesized entirely *de novo*, evidence strongly supports a **reassembly model**. During mitotic breakdown, membrane components of the [nuclear envelope](@entry_id:136792), including [integral membrane proteins](@entry_id:140847), are absorbed into the interconnected network of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Live-[cell imaging](@entry_id:185308) experiments, using fusion proteins such as an inner nuclear membrane protein tagged with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), have demonstrated this process elegantly. In such experiments, the distinct fluorescent ring of the interphase nuclear envelope is seen to disperse into the broader ER network during [prophase](@entry_id:170157). Then, during [telophase](@entry_id:169480), this fluorescence is observed to specifically accumulate around the decondensing chromatin masses, eventually coalescing to form two new, complete nuclear envelopes. This demonstrates that the old components are recycled from the ER reservoir to build the new structures [@problem_id:2324825].

### Regulation of Mitotic Exit: The Inactivation of MPF

The transition from the mitotic state to the interphase state is not a passive process but is driven by a master regulatory switch: the inactivation of **Mitosis-Promoting Factor (MPF)**. The high activity of the MPF kinase ($CDK1$-Cyclin B) is responsible for driving the cell into [mitosis](@entry_id:143192) and maintaining it in that state by phosphorylating a vast array of substrates, including lamins (promoting [nuclear envelope breakdown](@entry_id:177901)) and [condensin](@entry_id:193794) components (promoting [chromosome condensation](@entry_id:171077)).

To exit mitosis, MPF must be inactivated. This is accomplished by the degradation of its regulatory subunit, Cyclin B. At the [metaphase](@entry_id:261912)-to-anaphase transition, a large E3 ubiquitin [ligase](@entry_id:139297) complex called the **Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C)** is activated. The APC/C targets Cyclin B for [ubiquitination](@entry_id:147203) by recognizing a specific motif known as the "destruction box." Ubiquitinated Cyclin B is then rapidly degraded by the proteasome, leading to a sharp drop in MPF activity.

The necessity of MPF inactivation for [mitotic exit](@entry_id:172994) can be demonstrated through genetic experiments. If cells are engineered to express a mutant form of Cyclin B that lacks its destruction box, the APC/C cannot target it for degradation. Even after anaphase begins, MPF activity remains persistently high. In such cells, the events of [telophase](@entry_id:169480) are profoundly inhibited: the chromosomes fail to decondense, the nuclear envelope fails to reform, and cytokinesis is blocked. This powerful experimental result confirms that the inactivation of MPF is an absolute prerequisite for a cell to reverse the mitotic program and complete division [@problem_id:2324842].

### Cytokinesis: Division of the Cytoplasm

Cytokinesis is the physical process that divides the cytoplasm of a parental cell into two daughter cells. While it often overlaps temporally with [telophase](@entry_id:169480), it is a mechanistically distinct process. The strategy employed for cytokinesis differs fundamentally between animal cells, which have a flexible plasma membrane, and plant cells, which are encased in a rigid cell wall.

### Cytokinesis in Animal Cells: Contraction and Abscission

In animal cells, [cytokinesis](@entry_id:144612) is achieved by the formation and constriction of an **[actomyosin contractile ring](@entry_id:150299)**. This process can be broken down into three key stages: positioning, contraction, and [abscission](@entry_id:154777).

First, the cell must determine the plane of division. This is not dictated by the cell's geometric center but by the position of the mitotic spindle. During [anaphase](@entry_id:165003), the **central spindle**, the region of overlapping microtubules between the separating sets of chromosomes, generates a positive signal. This signal leads to the localized activation of the small GTPase **RhoA** in a narrow band at the overlying [cell cortex](@entry_id:172828). Classic experiments involving the physical displacement of the mitotic spindle have shown that the [cleavage furrow](@entry_id:269476) invariably forms at the midplane of the spindle, regardless of its position within the cell. This results in an [asymmetric division](@entry_id:175451), producing daughter cells of unequal size, proving that the spindle itself dictates the division plane [@problem_id:2324817].

Second, active RhoA at the equatorial cortex orchestrates the assembly of the contractile ring. This ring is not formed entirely from scratch. Instead, it is primarily assembled through the reorganization and recruitment of actin filaments from the pre-existing **[cell cortex](@entry_id:172828)**, a dense meshwork of actin underlying the [plasma membrane](@entry_id:145486) [@problem_id:2324840]. Active RhoA promotes both the polymerization of new [actin filaments](@entry_id:147803) and the activation of myosin II [motor proteins](@entry_id:140902), which generate the contractile force. The ring then constricts, pulling the [plasma membrane](@entry_id:145486) inward and forming a **[cleavage furrow](@entry_id:269476)** that progressively deepens until the connection between the nascent daughter cells is a thin stalk of cytoplasm called the **intercellular bridge**.

Finally, the division must be completed by severing this bridge in a process called **[abscission](@entry_id:154777)**. The intercellular bridge contains a dense, stable bundle of microtubules derived from the central spindle, known as the **midbody**. This structure serves as a platform for the recruitment of the machinery that performs the final cut. The key players in this step are the **Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT)** machinery. These protein complexes are recruited to the midbody and assemble into spiral-like filaments that constrict the membrane from within, ultimately leading to [membrane fission](@entry_id:175637) and the separation of the two daughter cells. Inhibition of ESCRT recruitment to the midbody prevents [abscission](@entry_id:154777), causing cells to complete furrow [ingression](@entry_id:265618) but remain physically connected by the intercellular bridge [@problem_id:2324841].

### Cytokinesis in Plant Cells: Construction of the Cell Plate

Plant cells cannot utilize a contractile ring and [cleavage furrow](@entry_id:269476). The fundamental reason for this difference is the presence of a **rigid cell wall** made of cellulose and other polymers that encases the cell. This external structure provides immense structural support but cannot be indented or "pinched in" by an internal contractile force [@problem_id:2324882]. Therefore, plant cells have evolved a strategy to build a new partition from the inside out.

Following [anaphase](@entry_id:165003), a unique microtubule-based structure called the **[phragmoplast](@entry_id:138034)** forms in the center of the cell, between the two daughter nuclei. The [phragmoplast](@entry_id:138034) is composed of two opposing sets of [microtubules](@entry_id:139871), and it functions as a scaffold to guide the delivery of vesicles to the cell's equatorial plane.

These vesicles, which contain the building materials for the new partition, are derived primarily from the **Golgi apparatus**. The Golgi synthesizes and packages cell wall precursors, such as pectins and hemicelluloses, along with lipids and proteins for the new plasma membrane, into [secretory vesicles](@entry_id:173380). These vesicles are transported along the [phragmoplast](@entry_id:138034) [microtubules](@entry_id:139871) to the center of the cell, where they fuse with one another. This fusion event creates a nascent, membrane-bound structure called the **[cell plate](@entry_id:140424)**. The [cell plate](@entry_id:140424) grows centrifugally, expanding outwards as more Golgi-derived vesicles are added at its perimeter, until it eventually fuses with the parental [plasma membrane](@entry_id:145486) and cell wall, completing the separation of the two daughter cells [@problem_id:2324879]. The contents of the fused vesicles form the new middle lamella and primary cell walls, while their membranes become the new plasma membranes of the daughter cells.
