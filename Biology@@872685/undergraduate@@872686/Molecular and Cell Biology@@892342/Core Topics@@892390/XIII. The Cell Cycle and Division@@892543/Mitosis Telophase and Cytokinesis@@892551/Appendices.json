In this first exercise, we will explore the mechanics of animal cell cytokinesis through a thought experiment where we specifically disable the molecular 'motor' of the contractile ring. This practice will help clarify the essential role of myosin-II and distinguish the process of cytoplasmic division (cytokinesis) from nuclear division (karyokinesis). [@problem_id:2324836]", "problem": "An experimental biologist is studying the cell cycle in a culture of animal fibroblast cells. A specific cell is observed to have successfully completed anaphase, with its duplicated chromosomes fully separated and localized at the opposite poles of the cell. At this precise moment, a potent and highly specific small-molecule inhibitor, \"Myoblockin,\" is introduced into the culture medium. Myoblockin is known to exclusively bind to and inactivate the motor protein myosin-II, preventing it from hydrolyzing Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and generating force. Assuming all other cellular processes remain unaffected, which of the following descriptions most accurately predicts the final state of this specific cell after the mitotic and cytokinetic processes would normally have concluded?\n\nA. A single, enlarged cell containing two distinct nuclei.\n\nB. A single cell arrested in anaphase, with chromosomes condensed at the poles.\n\nC. A single cell containing one large nucleus with double the normal chromosome content.\n\nD. Two separate, genetically identical daughter cells of normal size.\n\nE. The cell will immediately fragment and undergo apoptosis due to checkpoint failure.", "solution": "The key facts and logical sequence are as follows.\n\n1) State of the cell at drug addition: The cell has completed anaphase, meaning sister chromatids have been segregated to opposite poles by the mitotic spindle. This implies that the spindle-assembly checkpoint has been satisfied, separase has acted, cohesin has been cleaved, and anaphase A/B have occurred to position chromosomes at the poles.\n\n2) Role of myosin-II in subsequent events: Cytokinesis in animal cells requires assembly and constriction of the actomyosin contractile ring at the equatorial cortex. Myosin-II is the ATPase motor that interacts with filamentous actin to generate constriction force and drive cleavage furrow ingression. Inhibiting myosin-II ATPase activity prevents contractile ring constriction and furrow ingression.\n\n3) Processes unaffected by Myoblockin: By assumption, all other cellular processes remain unaffected. Therefore, mitotic exit proceeds: the cell transitions to telophase, spindle disassembles, the nuclear envelope re-forms around each segregated chromosome set, and chromosomes decondense within each nascent nucleus. Karyokinesis thus completes, producing two nuclei.\n\n4) Consequence for cytokinesis: Without myosin-II–driven constriction, the cleavage furrow cannot ingress, the intercellular bridge and midbody cannot be properly formed to completion, and abscission cannot occur. Therefore, the plasma membrane does not divide the cytoplasm into two separate cells.\n\n5) Predicted final state: The cell will not split; it will remain as one cell containing two re-formed nuclei (a binucleated cell). This matches a single, enlarged cell with two distinct nuclei.\n\n6) Exclusion of alternatives:\n- Option B is incorrect because anaphase has already been completed and Myoblockin does not arrest chromosomes at the poles; mitotic exit proceeds.\n- Option C is incorrect because one large nucleus with doubled DNA content would require failure of karyokinesis; here, nuclear envelopes re-form around each segregated set, yielding two nuclei.\n- Option D is incorrect because cytokinesis fails without myosin-II, so two daughter cells do not form.\n- Option E is incorrect because immediate apoptosis due to checkpoint failure is not mandated; the spindle checkpoint has been satisfied, and cells commonly become binucleated after cytokinesis failure rather than undergoing immediate apoptosis.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is a single binucleated cell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2324836"}, {"introduction": "While animal cells pinch in two, plant cells must build a new wall from the inside out, a consequence of their rigid exterior. This next problem shifts our focus to plant cytokinesis, a fundamentally different process involving the assembly of a cell plate from Golgi-derived vesicles. By imagining a scenario where these vesicular building blocks cannot fuse, we can better appreciate the unique molecular machinery involved in dividing a walled cell. [@problem_id:2324871]", "problem": "In a controlled laboratory experiment, a synchronized culture of onion root tip cells is allowed to proceed through mitosis. Just as the cells enter telophase, a researcher introduces a novel chemical agent called \"fusostatin.\" This agent has a highly specific effect: it completely inhibits the fusion of vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus without affecting any other cellular processes, such as vesicle transport or the function of the cytoskeleton. What is the most likely and immediate structural outcome for a cell treated with fusostatin as it attempts to complete cell division?\n\nA. The cell would become binucleate, containing two separate nuclei within a single, shared cytoplasm.\n\nB. The cell would form a contractile ring and divide via cleavage furrowing, similar to an animal cell.\n\nC. The cell would arrest in anaphase, as the separation of sister chromatids would be blocked.\n\nD. Two distinct daughter cells would form, but they would be separated only by a plasma membrane, lacking a cell wall and middle lamella.\n\nE. The chromosomes from both poles would decondense into a single, large tetraploid nucleus.", "solution": "Key cellular principles:\n- In plant cytokinesis, the phragmoplast guides Golgi-derived vesicles to the cell equator. These vesicles must fuse to form the cell plate, which simultaneously generates the new plasma membranes of the daughter cells and deposits cell wall materials that become the middle lamella and primary walls between the daughters.\n- Vesicle fusion is required both to create a continuous membrane sheet (new daughter plasma membranes at the division plane) and to assemble the nascent cell wall matrix. Transport of vesicles without fusion only accumulates vesicles without forming a continuous plate.\n- Telophase involves reformation of nuclear envelopes around segregated chromosome sets and chromosome decondensation; this proceeds independently of vesicle fusion for the cell plate.\n\nGiven fusostatin blocks Golgi vesicle fusion but not transport or cytoskeletal function:\n1. Vesicles will still be delivered to the midline by the intact phragmoplast but will fail to fuse, preventing formation of a continuous cell plate.\n2. Because the new daughter plasma membranes at the division plane arise from the fusion of these vesicles, no separating plasma membrane will form at the equator if fusion is inhibited. Therefore, two distinct daughter cells separated only by a plasma membrane cannot arise.\n3. Karyokinesis (chromosome segregation) has already occurred by telophase; thus, anaphase arrest is not relevant, and sister chromatid separation is not affected by the drug.\n4. Plant cells do not switch to contractile ring cleavage furrowing in the presence of an intact cell wall; moreover, the agent does not reprogram the cytokinetic mechanism.\n5. The two chromosome sets will each become enclosed by their own reforming nuclear envelopes during telophase, yielding two separate nuclei. There is no mechanism to fuse them into a single tetraploid nucleus under these conditions.\n\nImmediate structural outcome:\n- Cytokinesis fails, but nuclear division completes, yielding a single cell containing two separate nuclei within a shared cytoplasm (a binucleate cell).\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2324871"}, {"introduction": "Scientific knowledge advances by testing competing hypotheses through carefully designed experiments. This final practice moves beyond understanding known mechanisms and challenges you to think like a cell biologist trying to solve a puzzle about the central spindle's function. By predicting the outcomes of a hypothetical laser ablation experiment, you will learn how to use experimental logic to distinguish between plausible scientific models. [@problem_id:2324816]", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the role of the central spindle in animal cell cytokinesis. The central spindle is a structure composed of microtubule bundles that forms between the separating sets of chromosomes during anaphase and telophase. Two primary, non-exclusive hypotheses for its function are debated:\n\nHypothesis 1: The central spindle is required to send an initial signal that specifies the position of the cleavage furrow at the cell equator. Once this positioning signal is delivered, the spindle's role is complete, and the furrow can ingress autonomously.\n\nHypothesis 2: The central spindle is required throughout cytokinesis, not only for positioning the furrow but also for providing continuous signals that maintain the contractile ring and drive its ingression.\n\nTo distinguish between these hypotheses, the biologist designs two experiments using a high-precision laser microbeam to ablate the central spindle in a dividing cell, without damaging other structures.\n- Experiment A: The central spindle is ablated during early anaphase, before any visible sign of cleavage furrow formation.\n- Experiment B: The central spindle is ablated during telophase, after the cleavage furrow has already formed and has ingressed to approximately 25% of the cell's diameter.\n\nWhich of the following sets of observations from these experiments would provide the strongest and most direct support for Hypothesis 2 over Hypothesis 1?\n\nA. In Experiment A, a cleavage furrow fails to form. In Experiment B, the existing cleavage furrow continues to ingress and successfully divides the cell.\n\nB. In Experiment A, a cleavage furrow fails to form. In Experiment B, the existing cleavage furrow halts its ingression and then regresses, leading to a failed cytokinesis.\n\nC. In Experiment A, a cleavage furrow forms normally. In Experiment B, the existing cleavage furrow halts its ingression and then regresses.\n\nD. In Experiment A, a cleavage furrow forms at a random, non-equatorial position. In Experiment B, the existing cleavage furrow continues to ingress and successfully divides the cell.\n\nE. In both Experiment A and Experiment B, the cleavage furrow forms and ingresses normally, leading to successful cell division.", "solution": "We compare the predictions of the two hypotheses against the outcomes of ablating the central spindle at two different times.\n\nBy Hypothesis 1 (initial-positioning-only): The central spindle is required to deliver the initial spatial cue that specifies the equatorial site of cleavage. After that cue is received, the contractile ring and furrow ingression proceed autonomously. Therefore:\n- If the central spindle is ablated early (before furrow formation), the furrow should fail to form (no initial cue delivered).\n- If the central spindle is ablated late (after the furrow has formed and begun ingression), the furrow should continue ingression to completion (maintenance signals are unnecessary).\n\nBy Hypothesis 2 (continuous requirement throughout cytokinesis): The central spindle is required not only for initial positioning but also for ongoing maintenance and progression of the contractile ring and furrow ingression. Therefore:\n- If the central spindle is ablated early (before furrow formation), the furrow should fail to form (no initial cue).\n- If the central spindle is ablated late (after the furrow has formed and partially ingressed, e.g., to about one quarter of the cell diameter), the furrow should halt and regress because the maintenance/ingression-driving signals are lost.\n\nNow match the predicted outcomes to the options:\n- Option A reports early failure to form a furrow and late normal completion. This aligns with Hypothesis 1 and contradicts Hypothesis 2’s prediction of late failure.\n- Option B reports early failure to form a furrow and late halting and regression of the existing furrow. This matches both aspects required by Hypothesis 2: initial requirement and ongoing requirement, and contradicts Hypothesis 1’s prediction of late autonomy.\n- Option C reports early normal furrow formation despite early ablation, which is inconsistent with both hypotheses as stated (both posit at least an initial role for the central spindle), though the late failure is consistent with Hypothesis 2. This is not the strongest or most direct support.\n- Option D reports early mispositioning (random, non-equatorial) and late normal completion, supporting a positioning-only role consistent with Hypothesis 1.\n- Option E reports no effect at either time, indicating the spindle is not required, contradicting both hypotheses.\n\nThus, the strongest and most direct support for Hypothesis 2 over Hypothesis 1 is provided by Option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2324816"}]}
