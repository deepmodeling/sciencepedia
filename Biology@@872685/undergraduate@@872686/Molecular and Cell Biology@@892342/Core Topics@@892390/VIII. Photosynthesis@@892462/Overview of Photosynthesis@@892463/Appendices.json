In essence, $CO_{2}$ is reduced to carbohydrate, retaining oxygen atoms in the product $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$, while water serves as the electron and proton source and contributes the oxygen that is released as $O_{2}$.\n\nApply isotopic tracing to each experiment:\n\nExperiment I: Medium has $H_{2}^{18}O$ and supplied gas is $C^{16}O_{2}$.\n- From the photolysis step, the evolved $O_{2}$ will contain the heavy isotope because its oxygen atoms come from $H_{2}^{18}O$. Therefore, $^{18}O$ appears in $O_{2}$.\n- The glucose formed incorporates carbon and oxygen from $CO_{2}$; since the $CO_{2}$ contains $^{16}O$, the oxygen in $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$ will be $^{16}O$, not $^{18}O$.\n\nExperiment II: Medium has $H_{2}^{16}O$ and supplied gas is $C^{18}O_{2}$.\n- The evolved $O_{2}$ derives from $H_{2}O$, which here is $H_{2}^{16}O$, so $O_{2}$ will contain $^{16}O$, not $^{18}O$.\n- The glucose oxygen atoms are derived from $CO_{2}$; because the $CO_{2}$ is $C^{18}O_{2}$, $^{18}O$ will be incorporated into $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$.\n\nTherefore, in Experiment I, $^{18}O$ is found in $O_{2}$; in Experiment II, $^{18}O$ is found in $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2328734"}, {"introduction": "Having established the source of photosynthetic oxygen, we now turn to the mechanism of energy conversion. The light reactions harness solar energy to produce two essential molecules: ATP and NADPH. This thought experiment probes the core principle of ATP synthesis—chemiosmosis—by asking you to predict the outcome of a specific molecular disruption. By considering a hypothetical chloroplast with a thylakoid membrane that is \"leaky\" to protons, you can isolate and appreciate the critical importance of maintaining a proton gradient for powering ATP synthase [@problem_id:2328776].", "problem": "In a typical chloroplast, the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis occur across the thylakoid membranes. A key aspect of this process is the generation of a proton ($H^+$) concentration gradient across the thylakoid membrane, which is normally impermeable to protons except through specific channels. This gradient is essential for producing Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). Concurrently, these reactions also produce reduced Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH).\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario in which a plant cell contains chloroplasts with a genetic mutation. This mutation causes the thylakoid membranes to become freely permeable to protons, allowing them to diffuse across the membrane without restriction. Assume that all other components of the photosynthetic machinery, including the photosystems and the electron transport chain, are fully functional and that the chloroplast is illuminated with an adequate supply of light.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the direct and immediate effect of this mutation on the rates of ATP and NADPH synthesis?\n\nA. The rate of synthesis of both ATP and NADPH will decrease to zero.\n\nB.

With coupling stoichiometry $n_{\\text{H}}$ protons per ATP, the available driving work per ATP is $n_{\\text{H}}F\\Delta p$. When $\\Delta p\\rightarrow 0$, the forward driving force for ATP synthesis vanishes, so the rate of ATP synthesis decreases to near zero.\n\nBy contrast, NADPH synthesis results from linear electron flow driven by light: electrons from water oxidation pass through the photosystems and cytochrome $b_{6}f$ to ferredoxin, reducing NADP^{+} to NADPH at ferredoxin–NADP^{+} reductase. This electron transfer is powered by photon-induced charge separations and does not require a proton gradient as a direct driving force. With photosystems and the electron transport chain fully functional and adequate light, the immediate rate of NADPH production remains largely unaffected by dissipation of $\\Delta p$ (indeed, removal of lumen acidification can relieve photosynthetic control at cytochrome $b_{6}f$, but the key direct effect is on ATP synthesis, not NADPH formation).\n\nTherefore, the direct and immediate effect is that ATP synthesis falls to near zero, while NADPH synthesis is largely unaffected.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2328776"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept that a proton gradient is essential for ATP synthesis, this next practice invites you to look \"under the hood\" at the machinery that builds this gradient. The electron transport chain features elegant molecular complexes that couple electron flow to proton translocation. This problem asks you to perform a careful accounting of the protons moved by one such machine, the cytochrome $b_6f$ complex, as it executes the sophisticated Q-cycle. Mastering this calculation provides a deeper, quantitative appreciation for how light energy is efficiently converted into the proton-motive force that drives the synthesis of ATP [@problem_id:2328720].", "problem": "In the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane is established, which drives the synthesis of ATP. A critical contributor to this gradient is the linear electron flow from Photosystem II (PSII) to Photosystem I (PSI).\n\nThe process begins with the oxidation of water at the oxygen-evolving complex associated with PSII, which is located on the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane. This reaction produces electrons, protons, and molecular oxygen.\n\nThe electrons are then transferred via PSII to a mobile electron carrier, plastoquinone (PQ). Upon receiving two electrons, a PQ molecule also picks up two protons from the stroma, becoming fully reduced to plastoquinol (PQH₂).\n\nThis PQH₂ molecule then diffuses to the cytochrome $b_6f$ complex (Cyt $b_6f$), which facilitates the transfer of electrons to PSI via the mobile carrier plastocyanin. This transfer occurs through a mechanism known as the Q-cycle, which proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  A first PQH₂ molecule binds to the Qp site of the Cyt $b_6f$ complex, facing the thylakoid lumen. It releases its two protons into the lumen and transfers its two electrons along two different paths. One electron is passed to PSI via the high-potential chain (involving an Iron-Sulfur protein and cytochrome f, and then plastocyanin). The other electron is passed via the low-potential chain (involving hemes $b_L$ and $b_H$) to a PQ molecule bound at the Qn site, which faces the stroma. This reduces the PQ to a plastosemiquinone radical anion (PQ⁻•).\n\n2.  A second PQH₂ molecule binds to the Qp site, also releasing its two protons into the lumen. Again, one electron is transferred to PSI via the high-potential chain. The second electron is transferred via the low-potential chain to the Qn site, where it fully reduces the plastosemiquinone radical. This doubly reduced PQ then binds two protons from the stroma, regenerating one molecule of PQH₂. This new PQH₂ can re-enter the plastoquinone pool.\n\nBased solely on the mechanisms described, calculate the total net number of protons that accumulate in the thylakoid lumen for every pair of electrons that are successfully transferred from water, through PSII and the Cyt $b_6f$ complex, to PSI.", "solution": "We track protons moved per pair of electrons, keeping explicit stoichiometry for each mechanistic step described.\n\nFrom water oxidation at the PSII oxygen-evolving complex on the lumenal side, the reaction is:\n$$2\\,\\mathrm{H_{2}O} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{O_{2}} + 4\\,\\mathrm{H^{+}_{lumen}} + 4\\,e^{-}.$$\nThus, for $2\\,e^{-}$ transferred, the proportionate proton release into the lumen is:\n$$4\\,e^{-} \\Rightarrow 4\\,\\mathrm{H^{+}_{lumen}} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad 2\\,e^{-} \\Rightarrow 2\\,\\mathrm{H^{+}_{lumen}}.$$\n\nPlastoquinone reduction at PSII occurs on the stromal side:\n$$\\mathrm{PQ} + 2\\,e^{-} + 2\\,\\mathrm{H^{+}_{stroma}} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{PQH_{2}},$$\nwhich does not add protons to the lumen but removes $2\\,\\mathrm{H^{+}}$ from the stroma.\n\nThrough the cytochrome $b_{6}f$ Q-cycle, to pass a pair of electrons to PSI, two $\\mathrm{PQH_{2}}$ bind sequentially at the Qp site and each releases $2\\,\\mathrm{H^{+}}$ into the lumen:\n$$2\\,\\mathrm{PQH_{2}} \\xrightarrow{\\mathrm{Qp}} 4\\,\\mathrm{H^{+}_{lumen}} + \\text{electrons to high/low potential chains}.$$\nConcurrently, at the Qn site, one $\\mathrm{PQ}$ is reduced back to $\\mathrm{PQH_{2}}$ by taking up $2\\,\\mathrm{H^{+}_{stroma}}$:\n$$\\mathrm{PQ} + 2\\,e^{-} + 2\\,\\mathrm{H^{+}_{stroma}} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{PQH_{2}},$$\nwhich again does not add protons to the lumen.
