A specific type of molecule, transfer RNA (tRNA), is responsible for deciphering this code by matching its three-nucleotide anticodon to a corresponding three-nucleotide codon on the mRNA. This binding ensures that the correct amino acid, carried by the tRNA, is added to the growing polypeptide chain.\n\nThe interaction between the codon and anticodon follows the rules of complementary base pairing (Adenine with Uracil; Guanine with Cytosine) and occurs in an antiparallel fashion.\n\nConsider a tRNA molecule that transports the amino acid tryptophan.

The \"wobble hypothesis\" explains how a single tRNA molecule can recognize multiple, distinct codons for the same amino acid, reducing the number of tRNAs a cell must produce. This practice delves into this elegant concept by examining the role of modified bases, such as inosine (I), at the first position of the anticodon, revealing the expanded pairing rules that govern this crucial interaction [@problem_id:2346036].", "problem": "In the process of protein synthesis, a transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule recognizes a specific three-nucleotide sequence on a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule, known as a codon. This recognition is mediated by the tRNA's anticodon loop. The pairing between the first two bases of the mRNA codon and the last two bases of the tRNA anticodon follows standard Watson-Crick base pairing rules. However, the pairing between the third base of the codon and the first base of the anticodon can be more flexible, a phenomenon described by the \"wobble hypothesis\".\n\nConsider a specific tRNA that carries the anticodon 5'-IGC-3'. The 'I' in this sequence represents inosine, a modified purine base commonly found at the wobble position of tRNAs.

This requires an understanding of codon-anticodon pairing, including its antiparallel nature and the wobble hypothesis.\n\nFirst, we must establish the correct orientation for pairing. The mRNA codon and the tRNA anticodon bind in an antiparallel fashion. This means the 5' end of the codon pairs with the 3' end of the anticodon, and vice versa.\n\nThe given tRNA anticodon is 5'-IGC-3'. To visualize the pairing with an mRNA codon (which is read 5' to 3'), it's helpful to write the anticodon in the 3' to 5' direction:\nAnticodon: 3'-CGI-5'\n\nNow, let's determine the complementary mRNA codon, which will have the orientation 5'-XYZ-3':\n$$\n\\text{mRNA codon: } 5' - X\\;Y\\;Z - 3' \\\\\n\\text{tRNA anticodon: } 3' - C\\;G\\;I - 5'\n$$\n\nThe pairing occurs between the bases at each position:\n- The first base of the codon (X) pairs with the third base of the anticodon (C).\n- The second base of the codon (Y) pairs with the second base of the anticodon (G).\n- The third base of the codon (Z) pairs with the first base of the anticodon (I).\n\nThe first two pairs follow standard Watson-Crick base pairing rules:\n- At the first position of the codon, X pairs with C. Therefore, X must be Guanine (G).\n- At the second position of the codon, Y pairs with G. Therefore, Y must be Cytosine (C).\n\nSo far, we know the codon must be of the form 5'-GCZ-3'.\n\nThe third position of the codon (Z) pairs with the first position of the anticodon (I). This is the \"wobble\" position. The wobble hypothesis states that the pairing rules at this position are less strict. For Inosine (I) at the 5' position of the anticodon, it can form hydrogen bonds with three different bases at the 3' position of the codon: Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), and Uracil (U). Inosine cannot pair with Guanine (G).\n\nTherefore, the third base of the codon, Z, can be A, C, or U.\n\nCombining this with our findings for the first two positions, we can list all possible codons:\n1. If Z = A, the codon is 5'-GCA-3'.\n2. If Z = C, the codon is 5'-GCC-3'.\n3. If Z = U, the codon is 5'-GCU-3'.\n\nThus, the tRNA with the anticodon 5'-IGC-3' can recognize three different mRNA codons: 5'-GCA-3', 5'-GCC-3', and 5'-GCU-3'.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n- A. 5'-GCA-3' only: This is incomplete.\n- B. 5'-GCC-3' only: This is incomplete and only considers the standard G-C like pairing.\n- C. 5'-GCA-3', 5'-GCC-3', and 5'-GCU-3': This list matches our derived set of possible codons.\n- D. 5'-GCA-3', 5'-GCC-3', 5'-GCU-3', and 5'-GCG-3': This is incorrect because it includes 5'-GCG-3', which would require I to pair with G. This pairing does not occur in wobble interactions.\n- E. 5'-ACG-3', 5'-CCG-3', and 5'-UCG-3': This is incorrect and likely results from a misunderstanding of the antiparallel nature of pairing, potentially by reversing the codon sequence.\n\nThe correct choice is the one that lists all three valid codons and no others.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2346036"}, {"introduction": "Accurate translation depends not only on correct codon-anticodon pairing at the ribosome but also on the preceding step: ensuring each tRNA is charged with its correct amino acid. This critical process is carried out by enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. This thought experiment challenges us to consider how a synthetase identifies its specific tRNA, forcing us to look beyond the anticodon and appreciate that a tRNA's \"identity\" is often written in other parts of its structure, a key principle in the fidelity of protein synthesis [@problem_id:2346065].", "problem": "In a molecular biology laboratory, a team is investigating the specificity of protein synthesis machinery. They perform a genetic engineering experiment on the gene encoding the transfer RNA for Alanine (tRNA$^{\\text{Ala}}$). Using site-directed mutagenesis, they precisely alter the three nucleotides of the anticodon, changing them from the Alanine anticodon (5'-IGC-3', where I is Inosine) to the Glycine anticodon (5'-UCC-3'). All other regions of the tRNA molecule, including the acceptor stem, remain identical to the original tRNA$^{\\text{Ala}}$.\n\nThis synthetic, chimeric tRNA is then placed in a controlled *in vitro* reaction mixture. The mixture contains all necessary components for tRNA charging, including an abundance of both Alanine and Glycine amino acids, as well as the full complement of functional aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS), specifically including Alanine-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) and Glycine-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS).\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the fate of this chimeric tRNA in the reaction mixture?\n\nA. The chimeric tRNA will be exclusively charged with Glycine, as the anticodon is the primary and sole determinant for recognition by the correct aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.\n\nB. The chimeric tRNA will be exclusively charged with Alanine, because critical recognition sites for the Alanine-tRNA synthetase exist outside of the anticodon loop.\n\nC. The chimeric tRNA will be charged with both Alanine and Glycine in approximately equal amounts, as the conflicting recognition signals will lead to non-specific charging by both synthetases.\n\nD. The chimeric tRNA will not be charged with any amino acid, because the contradictory features will prevent recognition by either the Alanine-tRNA synthetase or the Glycine-tRNA synthetase.\n\nE. The chimeric tRNA will be recognized by the ribosome but will fail to deliver an amino acid, causing translation to stall.", "solution": "The aminoacylation (charging) of a tRNA is determined by identity elements recognized by its cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS). While some aaRSs use the anticodon as a major identity determinant, many rely primarily on sequence and structural elements elsewhere, especially in the acceptor stem and the discriminator base.\n\nFor $tRNA^{\\text{Ala}}$, the principal and historically well-defined identity determinant resides in the acceptor stem: the wobble base pair G3-U70. This single base pair is both necessary and sufficient for recognition by alanine-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS). Experimental evidence shows that:\n- Transplanting the G3-U70 pair into non-alanine tRNAs confers alanine charging by AlaRS.\n- Mutating G3-U70 in $tRNA^{\\text{Ala}}$ abolishes alanine charging.\n- The anticodon of $tRNA^{\\text{Ala}}$ is largely dispensable for recognition and charging by AlaRS.\n\nIn the engineered tRNA described, only the anticodon has been changed from the alanine anticodon to the glycine anticodon. All other regions, including the acceptor stem, remain identical to native $tRNA^{\\text{Ala}}$. Therefore:\n1. AlaRS will still recognize the unchanged alanine identity elements (notably the G3-U70 base pair) in the acceptor stem and will charge this tRNA with alanine.\n2. GlyRS relies on glycine tRNA identity elements that include features outside the anticodon; since these are absent in this chimeric tRNA, GlyRS will not efficiently recognize or charge it, despite the presence of a glycine anticodon.\n3. Because aminoacylation specificity is dictated by the synthetase–tRNA interaction rather than by the anticodon alone, changing only the anticodon will not redirect charging to glycine.\n\nConsequently, the chimeric tRNA will be exclusively charged with alanine. Options proposing exclusive glycine charging (A), mixed charging (C), no charging (D), or ribosomal stalling without aminoacylation (E) contradict the established identity rules for $tRNA^{\\text{Ala}}$ and the known dispensability of its anticodon for AlaRS recognition.\n\nThus, the correct prediction is that the chimeric tRNA will be charged with alanine due to recognition by AlaRS via identity elements outside the anticodon loop.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2346065"}]}
