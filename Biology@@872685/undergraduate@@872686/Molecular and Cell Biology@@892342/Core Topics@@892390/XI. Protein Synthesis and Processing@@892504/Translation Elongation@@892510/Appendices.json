Mastering this allows you to predict which amino acid will be added to the growing polypeptide chain based on the genetic sequence [@problem_id:1531712].", "problem": "During an *in vitro* study of translation elongation, a researcher uses ribosomal profiling to determine the precise location of a ribosome on a messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript.

The tRNA anticodon must pair with this codon by Watson-Crick base pairing and in antiparallel orientation.

This practice uses a classic biochemical thought experiment involving a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog to dissect the elongation cycle. By analyzing where the process stalls, you will uncover the specific role of the elongation factor EF-Tu and appreciate why GTP hydrolysis is an indispensable checkpoint for tRNA selection before peptide bond formation can occur [@problem_id:2346195].", "problem": "An *in vitro* prokaryotic translation system is reconstituted from purified components. The system contains 70S ribosomes, a specific messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule, all necessary charged transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and the required protein elongation factors. The ribosome has successfully initiated translation, with the initiator tRNA carrying N-formylmethionine (fMet-tRNA) properly positioned in the P site. The A site is currently vacant and positioned over the second codon of the mRNA.\n\nFor the elongation phase to proceed, this system is supplied with all the required components, except that the standard Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) is completely replaced with GTPγS, a synthetic analog that can bind to GTP-binding proteins but cannot be hydrolyzed.\n\nGiven this setup, at which of the following stages will the translation elongation cycle be terminally arrested?\n\nA. The ribosome remains with a vacant A site because the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA complex cannot bind.\n\nB. An aminoacyl-tRNA binds to the A site, and the fMet is successfully transferred to it forming a dipeptide, but the ribosome is unable to translocate.\n\nC.

This ternary complex binds to the A site and samples codon-anticodon pairing. Correct pairing stimulates EF-Tu GTPase activity.\n\n2) GTP hydrolysis and accommodation: Hydrolysis of GTP on EF-Tu induces a conformational change that lowers EF-Tu’s affinity for tRNA and the ribosome, allowing EF-Tu-GDP to dissociate. Only after EF-Tu release can the aminoacyl-tRNA fully accommodate into the peptidyl transferase center (A/A state). This accommodation is a prerequisite for peptidyl transfer.\n\n3) Peptidyl transfer: The ribosomal peptidyl transferase catalyzes peptide bond formation between the peptidyl-tRNA in the P site and the aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site. This chemistry does not require GTP hydrolysis, but it strictly requires that the A-site tRNA be accommodated, which in turn requires prior EF-Tu GTP hydrolysis and release.\n\n4) Translocation: EF-G bound to GTP binds the pre-translocation ribosome and, upon GTP hydrolysis, drives movement of the tRNAs and mRNA to the next register, freeing the A site for the next cycle.\n\nNow replace GTP with the nonhydrolyzable analog GTP$\\gamma$S.

Consequently, the ternary complex remains ribosome-bound in the A/T state, and the aminoacyl-tRNA cannot accommodate into the peptidyl transferase center. Without accommodation, peptidyl transfer cannot occur.\n- Steps 3 and 4 therefore cannot be reached; EF-G action is irrelevant because the block occurs earlier.\n\nThis mechanistic analysis eliminates:\n- A: incorrect, because the ternary complex can bind the A site with GTP$\\gamma$S.\n- B: incorrect, because peptidyl transfer cannot occur without EF-Tu hydrolysis and release-driven accommodation.\n- C and E: incorrect, because the cycle stalls before EF-G engagement; EF-G-dependent translocation is never reached.\n\nThe stall point corresponds to the ternary complex binding but being unable to dissociate and permit accommodation, thereby preventing peptide bond formation, which matches option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2346195"}, {"introduction": "The remarkable accuracy of protein synthesis is not achieved by a single decision point but through a multi-step verification process called proofreading, which comes at an energetic cost. This problem moves beyond the initial selection step to explore kinetic proofreading, a mechanism that provides a final opportunity to reject a mismatched tRNA after GTP has already been spent. By calculating the \"GTP cost\" per rejected tRNA, you will quantify the energetic investment required to maintain high fidelity in protein synthesis, illustrating the fundamental trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and energy consumption in cellular processes [@problem_id:1531734].", "problem": "During protein synthesis in bacteria, the ribosome maintains high fidelity through a multi-step process. One of these steps is kinetic proofreading, which helps to reject incorrectly matched aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs). Consider the events that occur after a ternary complex, composed of Elongation Factor Thermo unstable (EF-Tu), Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP), and a near-cognate aa-tRNA, binds to the A-site of a translating ribosome.\n\nThe process can be simplified into the following model:\n1.  Upon initial binding, the ternary complex can either dissociate from the ribosome (a GTP-free event) or EF-Tu can hydrolyze its bound GTP.\n2.  If GTP hydrolysis occurs, the EF-Tu-GDP complex is released. This event consumes exactly one molecule of GTP.\n3.  Following GTP hydrolysis, the near-cognate aa-tRNA is in an unstable state at the A-site and faces two mutually exclusive, competing kinetic pathways:\n    *   **Accommodation:** The aa-tRNA undergoes a conformational change and is incorrectly incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain. This occurs with a first-order rate constant $k_{\\text{acc}}$.\n    *   **Rejection:** The aa-tRNA dissociates from the A-site before peptide bond formation can occur. This successful proofreading step occurs with a first-order rate constant $k_{\\text{rej}}$.\n\nBoth accommodation and rejection at this stage are contingent upon the prior hydrolysis of one GTP molecule.
