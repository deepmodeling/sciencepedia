This exercise [@problem_id:2325046] challenges you to predict the fate of a protein when this balance is disrupted by a mutation in its hydrophobic core. By working through this scenario, you'll reinforce your understanding of protein stability and the cell's essential quality control machinery, which recognizes and eliminates potentially harmful misfolded proteins.", "problem": "A hypothetical cytosolic enzyme, GlucoSynthase, plays a critical role in a newly discovered metabolic pathway in eukaryotic cells. Its stable, globular three-dimensional structure is essential for its catalytic activity and is maintained by a tightly packed hydrophobic core. A spontaneous point mutation occurs in the gene encoding GlucoSynthase, resulting in the substitution of a leucine residue with a serine residue at position 152 (Leu152Ser). This particular leucine residue has been determined to be located deep within the protein's hydrophobic core, far from the active site and any protein-protein interaction surfaces.\n\nAssuming the cell's protein synthesis and quality control machinery (e.g., chaperones, proteasome) are fully functional, what is the most probable fate of the newly synthesized Leu152Ser mutant GlucoSynthase protein within the cytoplasm?\n\nA. The protein will fold correctly and be fully functional, as the single amino acid change is too minor to affect the overall structure.\n\nB. The protein will fold normally but will be incorrectly transported to the mitochondria, mistaking the serine for a mitochondrial targeting signal.\n\nC. The protein will misfold due to the disruption of the hydrophobic core, be recognized by molecular chaperones, and subsequently targeted for degradation.\n\nD. The protein will fold into a stable, alternative conformation that grants it a new, unrelated enzymatic function, a process known as neofunctionalization.\n\nE. The protein will fold correctly, but its catalytic activity will be significantly enhanced because the polar serine residue stabilizes the transition state of the reaction.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most likely consequence of mutating a hydrophobic amino acid (leucine) to a polar amino acid (serine) within the hydrophobic core of a cytosolic protein. To determine the correct answer, we must analyze the principles of protein folding and cellular quality control.\n\nFirst, let's consider the fundamental driving forces of protein folding in an aqueous environment like the cytoplasm. The hydrophobic effect is a major contributor. Nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acid side chains, like that of leucine, are energetically driven to sequester themselves away from water. This leads to the formation of a stable hydrophobic core in globular proteins. Polar and charged residues typically remain on the protein surface where they can interact with water molecules.\n\nThe mutation in question is Leu152Ser. Leucine has a nonpolar, hydrophobic side chain ($-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH(CH}_3)_2$). Serine has a polar side chain ($-\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$) due to the presence of a hydroxyl group, which can act as a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor.\n\nThe substitution of the hydrophobic leucine with the polar serine at a position buried within the protein's core introduces a significant energetic penalty. The polar hydroxyl group of serine is now forced into a nonpolar environment where it cannot form favorable hydrogen bonds with water. This disruption destabilizes the packing of the hydrophobic core and, consequently, the protein's native three-dimensional structure. The protein is therefore highly unlikely to fold into its correct, stable, and functional conformation. This immediately makes options A and E improbable. Option A is incorrect because a single amino acid change in a critical location, such as the hydrophobic core, can have drastic effects on protein stability. Option E is incorrect because the protein must first fold correctly for its active site to be functional; a destabilized structure is more likely to be non-functional, not hyper-functional. Furthermore, the mutation is stated to be far from the active site.\n\nWith the protein likely misfolding, we must consider the cell's response. Cells possess sophisticated protein quality control systems to deal with misfolded or unfolded proteins. Misfolded proteins often expose hydrophobic patches on their surface that would normally be buried in the core. These exposed patches are recognized as a \"danger\" signal by a class of proteins called molecular chaperones (e.g., the Hsp70 and Hsp90 families).\n\nThe primary role of molecular chaperones is to bind to these exposed hydrophobic regions and attempt to facilitate correct refolding. However, if the protein is too badly damaged or intrinsically unstable due to a mutation like Leu152Ser, it may be unable to achieve its native state even with chaperone assistance. In such cases of persistent misfolding, the chaperone machinery, in conjunction with other factors, mediates the tagging of the misfolded protein for destruction. This tagging process typically involves the covalent attachment of a small protein called ubiquitin. A chain of ubiquitin molecules serves as a signal for the proteasome, a large, multi-subunit protease complex that recognizes, unfolds, and degrades the tagged protein into small peptides.\n\nThis pathway—misfolding, recognition by chaperones, and targeting for proteasomal degradation—is the cell's primary mechanism for eliminating potentially toxic, aggregation-prone, misfolded proteins. Therefore, this represents the most probable fate for the mutant GlucoSynthase.\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options.\nOption B is incorrect. While specific amino acid sequences can act as targeting signals, a single serine residue does not constitute a mitochondrial targeting signal. These signals are typically N-terminal amphipathic helices. Furthermore, the primary problem is misfolding, which would likely preclude proper transport anyway.\nOption D, neofunctionalization, describes an evolutionary process where a duplicated gene acquires a mutation that gives its protein product a new function. While theoretically possible, it is an extremely rare event and certainly not the immediate, \"most probable\" fate of a single misfolded protein within a cell. The default cellular response to misfolding is degradation.\nOption C accurately describes the entire sequence: the mutation disrupts the hydrophobic core, leading to misfolding. The misfolded state is recognized by chaperones, and because correct folding is unlikely, the protein is ultimately targeted for degradation. This prevents the accumulation of non-functional and potentially harmful protein aggregates.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2325046"}, {"introduction": "Molecular chaperones like Hsp70 are not static scaffolds; they are dynamic machines powered by ATP. This practice problem [@problem_id:2325051] explores the heart of the Hsp70 mechanism: its ATP-driven cycle of binding and releasing misfolded proteins. By considering how an inhibitor affects this cycle, you can gain a deeper appreciation for how energy is used to regulate protein affinity and drive the process of assisted folding.", "problem": "The Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family of molecular chaperones plays a critical role in cellular protein quality control. These proteins function by binding to unfolded or misfolded polypeptides, preventing their aggregation and facilitating their correct folding. The binding and release of substrate proteins by Hsp70 is tightly regulated by a cycle involving the binding and hydrolysis of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario where a living cell is treated with a novel, specific pharmacological inhibitor. This inhibitor is designed to permeate the cell membrane and block the binding of ATP to all Hsp70-family chaperones, without affecting their ability to bind substrate proteins or hydrolyze an already-bound ATP molecule to ADP.\n\nWhich of the following would be the most direct and significant consequence of introducing this inhibitor into the cell?\n\nA. A substantial increase in the overall cellular concentration of ATP, as a major ATP-consuming process has been inhibited.\n\nB. The immediate and complete cessation of all protein synthesis, as ribosomes become stalled.\n\nC. Misfolded proteins would be rapidly targeted for destruction by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which would be upregulated to compensate for chaperone failure.\n\nD. Hsp70 would become irreversibly locked in a high-affinity state with its substrate proteins, leading to widespread protein aggregation.", "solution": "Hsp70 chaperones cycle between nucleotide states that determine substrate affinity. The ATP-bound state has low substrate affinity and rapid binding-release kinetics; upon ATP hydrolysis to ADP (stimulated by J-domain cochaperones), Hsp70 shifts to a high-affinity, slow off-rate state that clamps substrates. Release of bound substrates requires nucleotide exchange factors to remove ADP and, critically, subsequent binding of ATP to drive the conformational switch back to the low-affinity state, which triggers substrate release.\n\nThe inhibitor in the prompt specifically prevents ATP from binding to Hsp70, while leaving substrate binding and the hydrolysis of any already-bound ATP intact. Therefore:\n1. Any Hsp70 currently in the ATP-bound state can still hydrolyze ATP to ADP, converting to the high-affinity state.\n2. Nucleotide exchange factors may remove ADP, but because ATP binding is blocked, Hsp70 cannot enter the ATP-bound, low-affinity state.\n3. Without ATP rebinding, Hsp70 remains in an ADP-bound or nucleotide-free conformation that maintains high substrate affinity, so bound substrates cannot be efficiently released.\n\nThe most direct and significant consequence is that Hsp70 becomes functionally locked in a high-affinity, substrate-bound state, halting its chaperone cycle and trapping client proteins. This loss of chaperone turnover impairs protein quality control and promotes accumulation of misfolded proteins, increasing aggregation.\n\nBy contrast:\n- A is unlikely because Hsp70 is not a dominant cellular ATP sink; inhibiting its ATP binding would not cause a substantial global ATP rise.\n- B is incorrect because ribosomes do not require Hsp70 for the core translational cycle; protein synthesis does not immediately cease.\n- C is not the direct consequence. While proteostasis pathways cross-talk, immediate upregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system is not guaranteed, and Hsp70 activity is often required for efficient triage to degradation.\n\nThus, D best matches the direct mechanistic outcome of blocking ATP binding to Hsp70.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2325051"}, {"introduction": "Understanding protein folding isn't just about cellular mechanisms; it's also about harnessing these principles for biotechnology.
