This exercise simulates a common type of genetic alteration, a single-base substitution, and asks you to predict its effect on the final protein.

This practice problem investigates the impact of a frameshift mutation, an event that scrambles the entire genetic message downstream from the error. You will not only observe how this can generate a premature stop signal and a nonfunctional protein but also explore the fascinating concept of a \"suppressor\" mutation that can restore the correct reading frame and rescue protein function.

The coding sequence of the Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) transcribed from this gene begins as follows:\n\n`5'-AUG CCU GGC UAU GCA AGU UGU AAA GAG CUU UAG-3'`\n\nA spontaneous mutation occurs, causing the insertion of a single Guanine (G) nucleotide between the second codon (CCU) and the third codon (GGC). This mutation results in a truncated, nonfunctional protein.\n\nTo recover a functional version of the protein, the geneticist screens for secondary \"suppressor\" mutations. Which of the following independent, secondary mutations in the already-mutated gene is most likely to restore the synthesis of a near-normal length and largely functional protein?\n\nFor your analysis, use the following partial codon table:\n- `AUG`: Methionine (Start)\n- `CCU`: Proline\n- `GGC`, `GGG`: Glycine\n- `UAU`: Tyrosine\n- `CAU`: Histidine\n- `CUA`: Leucine\n- `GCA`: Alanine\n- `AGU`: Serine\n- `UAA`, `UAG`: Stop\n\nA.

The sequence is\n5'-AUG CCU GGC UAU GCA AGU UGU AAA GAG CUU UAG-3',\nwhich groups into codons as\nAUG | CCU | GGC | UAU | GCA | AGU | UGU | AAA | GAG | CUU | UAG.\nUsing the provided codon table, this translates as Met–Pro–Gly–Tyr–Ala–Ser–Cys–Lys–Glu–Leu–Stop.\n\nApply the first mutation: insertion of a single G between the second (CCU) and third (GGC) codons. This causes a +1 frameshift. The once-mutated sequence becomes:\n`5'-AUG CCU G GGC UAU GCA AGU UGU AAA GAG CUU UAG-3'`\nReading from the start codon, the new codons are\nAUG | CCU | GGG | CUA | UGC | AAG | UUG | UAA | …\nThus, a premature stop `UAA` appears, yielding a truncated protein.\n\nEvaluate each proposed secondary mutation on this already-mutated gene.\n\nA. Insert a single C after the 12th nucleotide of the original sequence. A second single-nucleotide insertion gives a net frameshift of $+2$ (since $+1+ +1\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$), which does not restore the original reading frame. Indeed, although this additional insertion can move the premature stop out of frame at that local region, the reading frame remains incorrect throughout, producing a largely altered amino acid sequence rather than a near-normal protein. Therefore, this does not plausibly restore a near-normal, largely functional protein.\n\nB. Delete the single U at the 10th position of the original sequence. A single-nucleotide deletion will cancel the single-nucleotide insertion, as the net indel is $+1$ (first insertion) and $-1$ (this deletion), giving $+1-1=0$, i.e., no net frameshift. This restores the reading frame from the point of the deletion onwards. Explicitly, the mutated region `[+G] GGC [-U] UAU` becomes `G GGC AU`, which is read as the codons `GGG CAU`. The codons then become\nAUG | CCU | GGG | CAU | GCA | AGU | UGU | AAA | GAG | CUU | UAG.\nRelative to the original, the third codon changes from GGC to GGG (both Gly; a synonymous change), and the fourth codon changes from UAU (Tyr) to CAU (His), after which all downstream codons exactly match the original through the stop. This yields a near-normal length protein with only a single amino acid substitution beyond a synonymous change, which is the hallmark of a frameshift suppressor restoring function.\n\nC. Substitute the Guanine (G) at the 13th position of the original sequence with an Adenine (A). A single-nucleotide substitution does not change the frameshift; the reading frame remains $+1$ out of register, and the premature stop `UAA` persists, so the truncation remains.\n\nD. Delete the three nucleotides GGC at original positions 7–9. This is an in-frame deletion. The net indel becomes $+1-3=-2\\equiv +1 \\pmod{3}$, so the reading frame remains shifted. This does not restore a near-normal, largely functional protein.\n\nBy the principle of frameshift suppression, only an additional single-nucleotide deletion downstream of the original single-nucleotide insertion will restore the original reading frame and, if positioned early, will minimize amino acid changes. Option B does exactly this and yields a near-normal length, largely functional protein.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1527164"}]}
