This foundational exercise challenges you to connect atmospheric conditions—specifically, the direction of the wind—to a major biological event: a phytoplankton bloom. By working through this conceptual problem [@problem_id:1868728], you will identify the crucial physical mechanism of Ekman transport that drives the upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water, setting the stage for life to flourish at the ocean's surface.", "problem": "A marine environmental monitoring agency is studying the conditions that lead to large-scale phytoplankton blooms off the coast of California, which lies in the Northern Hemisphere. These blooms are crucial as they form the base of the marine food web. The agency observes a consistent correlation: sustained northerly winds (blowing from north to south, parallel to the coastline) are frequently followed by significant blooms, whereas southerly winds (blowing from south to north) are not. Assuming all other factors like sunlight and temperature are favorable, which of the following statements provides the primary physical mechanism that explains why northerly winds are more likely to trigger these phytoplankton blooms?\n\nA. The northerly wind drives a surface current to the south. In the Northern Hemisphere, the Coriolis effect deflects this surface flow to the right (westward, away from the coast). This offshore movement of surface water, known as Ekman transport, forces cold, nutrient-rich water from the deep ocean to rise up to the surface in a process called upwelling, which fuels the bloom.\n\nB. The northerly wind drives a surface current to the south. In the Northern Hemisphere, the Coriolis effect deflects this surface flow to the left (eastward, towards the coast). This onshore movement of water piles up at the coast and leads to downwelling, which brings nutrients up from the seafloor.\n\nC. The southerly wind drives a surface current to the north. In the Northern Hemisphere, the Coriolis effect deflects this surface flow to the right (eastward, towards the coast). The resulting downwelling warms the coastal waters, creating ideal thermal conditions for phytoplankton reproduction.\n\nD. Northerly winds originate from colder landmasses and are less humid. This leads to increased evaporation at the ocean surface, which increases the salinity and density of surface waters, causing them to sink and mix with nutrient-rich bottom layers.\n\nE. Phytoplankton are passively carried by winds. Northerly winds pick up dormant phytoplankton spores from inland sources and deposit them into the coastal ocean, directly seeding the bloom, while southerly winds blowing from the ocean do not.", "solution": "Set a right-handed coordinate system with $x$ pointing east, $y$ pointing north, and $z$ pointing upward. Approximate the California coast as aligned meridionally along $y$ at $x=0$, with the ocean to the west at $x<0$.\n\nThe depth-integrated Ekman transport per unit width is given by\n$$\n\\mathbf{M}_{E}=\\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\times \\hat{z}}{\\rho f},\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is the wind stress vector, $\\rho$ is seawater density, and $f=2\\Omega \\sin\\phi$ is the Coriolis parameter (positive in the Northern Hemisphere).\n\nFor a northerly wind (blowing from north to south), the wind stress points southward:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}=-\\tau\\,\\hat{y},\\quad \\tau>0.\n$$\nThen\n$$\n\\mathbf{M}_{E}=\\frac{(-\\tau \\hat{y})\\times \\hat{z}}{\\rho f}=-\\frac{\\tau}{\\rho f}\\,(\\hat{y}\\times \\hat{z})=-\\frac{\\tau}{\\rho f}\\,\\hat{x}.\n$$\nThus the Ekman transport is offshore (negative $x$, i.e., westward, away from the coast). This offshore export of surface water along a coastline creates divergence in the surface layer; mass continuity requires an upward vertical velocity near the coast to replace the exported water, i.e., coastal upwelling of deeper water. The upwelled water is typically colder and enriched in nutrients from below the nutricline, which, under favorable light and temperature, fuels phytoplankton blooms.\n\nBy contrast, for a southerly wind (blowing from south to north),\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}=+\\tau\\,\\hat{y}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\mathbf{M}_{E}=+\\frac{\\tau}{\\rho f}\\,\\hat{x},\n$$\nwhich is onshore Ekman transport (eastward), causing surface convergence and downwelling that tends to suppress the supply of nutrients to the surface.\n\nTherefore, the primary physical mechanism linking northerly winds to phytoplankton blooms is offshore Ekman transport and consequent upwelling, exactly as described in option A. Options B and C incorrectly assign the direction of Ekman transport or the nutrient effect of downwelling; D invokes an evaporation–salinity mechanism that is neither primary nor generally applicable; E is physically incorrect because phytoplankton are not wind-borne across land–sea interfaces in this manner.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1868728"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of wind-driven transport, this exercise moves from the conceptual to the quantitative. The movement of plankton, pollutants, or other particles in the ocean is rarely due to a single force; it's the result of multiple currents acting together. This practice problem [@problem_id:1868756] asks you to calculate the actual path of a passive drifter by combining a steady coastal current with the surface water movement caused by Ekman transport, demonstrating how to translate physical principles into a predictive trajectory.", "problem": "An oceanographic research team is studying larval dispersal within an eastern boundary current system, modeled after the Canary Current off the coast of Portugal. They deploy a small, neutrally buoyant drifter at the sea surface to simulate the passive transport of a planktonic larva. The research area is characterized by two primary water movements:\n\n1.  A steady, geostrophic coastal current that flows directly south, parallel to the coastline. The speed of this current is $v_c = 0.25 \\, \\text{m/s}$.\n2.  A net surface water movement due to Ekman transport. Persistent northerly winds (blowing from North to South) in this region induce a net transport of water in the surface layer at an angle of 90 degrees to the right of the wind direction. The speed of this Ekman transport is $v_E = 0.10 \\, \\text{m/s}$.\n\nAssume the coastline runs perfectly North-South.

The drifter's motion is the vector sum of the coastal current velocity and the Ekman transport velocity. We will determine the vector components for each movement, sum them to find the resultant velocity vector, and then calculate its direction as specified.\n\nFirst, we define the velocity vectors in the given coordinate system, where the positive y-axis is North and the positive x-axis is East.\n\nThe coastal current flows \"directly south\" with a speed of $v_c$. The south direction corresponds to the negative y-axis. Therefore, the velocity vector for the coastal current, $\\vec{v}_c$, is:\n$$ \\vec{v}_c = 0 \\hat{i} - v_c \\hat{j} = (0, -v_c) $$\n\nNext, we determine the velocity vector for the Ekman transport, $\\vec{v}_E$. The wind is \"northerly\", meaning it blows from North to South. This corresponds to a wind direction along the negative y-axis. Ekman transport in the Northern Hemisphere occurs at 90 degrees to the right of the wind direction. A 90-degree turn to the right (clockwise) from the negative y-axis direction (South) points along the negative x-axis direction (West). The speed of this transport is $v_E$. Therefore, the velocity vector for the Ekman transport is:\n$$ \\vec{v}_E = -v_E \\hat{i} + 0 \\hat{j} = (-v_E, 0) $$\n\nThe resultant velocity of the drifter, $\\vec{v}_{res}$, is the vector sum of these two velocities:\n$$ \\vec{v}_{res} = \\vec{v}_c + \\vec{v}_E = (-v_E, 0) + (0, -v_c) = (-v_E, -v_c) $$\nThe components of the resultant velocity are $v_x = -v_E$ and $v_y = -v_c$. Since both components are negative, the resultant vector points into the third quadrant (South-West).\n\nThe problem asks for the angle of this vector measured clockwise from North (the positive y-axis). Let's call this angle $\\alpha$. We can find this angle by considering the geometry. The direction of South (the negative y-axis) is 180 degrees clockwise from North. The resultant vector is deflected further clockwise from South by an angle $\\theta$.\n\nThis angle $\\theta$ is the angle between the negative y-axis and the vector $\\vec{v}_{res}$. We can find $\\theta$ using trigonometry on the components of the resultant velocity. The side \"opposite\" to $\\theta$ (in the westward direction) has a magnitude of $|v_x| = v_E$, and the side \"adjacent\" to $\\theta$ (in the southward direction) has a magnitude of $|v_y| = v_c$.\n$$ \\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}} = \\frac{|v_x|}{|v_y|} = \\frac{v_E}{v_c} $$\nSo, the angle of deflection westward from South is:\n$$ \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{v_E}{v_c}\\right) $$\nThe total angle $\\alpha$ clockwise from North is the sum of the 180 degrees to get to South, plus the angle $\\theta$:\n$$ \\alpha = 180^\\circ + \\theta = 180^\\circ + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{v_E}{v_c}\\right) $$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given numerical values: $v_c = 0.25 \\, \\text{m/s}$ and $v_E = 0.10 \\, \\text{m/s}$.\n$$ \\alpha = 180^\\circ + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{0.10}{0.25}\\right) $$\n$$ \\alpha = 180^\\circ + \\arctan(0.4) $$\nUsing a calculator set to degrees mode:\n$$ \\arctan(0.4) \\approx 21.8014^\\circ $$\n$$ \\alpha = 180^\\circ + 21.8014^\\circ = 201.8014^\\circ $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\alpha \\approx 202^\\circ $$\nThe final angle is 202 degrees clockwise from North.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{202}$$", "id": "1868756"}, {"introduction": "This final practice problem shifts our focus from the physical causes of upwelling to its profound biological consequences.

At time $t=0$, the wind driving the upwelling ceases, leading to the formation of a stable, stratified surface layer. The mixed layer at $t=0$ is rich in a single limiting nutrient (e.g., nitrate) with a concentration of $[N]_0 = 20.0$ micromoles per liter ($\\mu$M). Due to consumption by phytoplankton and the lack of replenishment from deep water, the nutrient concentration $[N]$ in the surface layer decays over time $t$ (in days) according to the model:\n$$ [N](t) = [N]_0 \\exp(-k_N t) $$\nwhere the decay constant is $k_N = 0.50 \\, \\text{day}^{-1}$.\n\nThe specific growth rate, $\\mu$, for a phytoplankton group is dependent on the nutrient concentration and is described by the Monod equation:\n$$ \\mu = \\mu_{\\text{max}} \\frac{[N]}{K_s + [N]} $$\nwhere $\\mu_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum specific growth rate and $K_s$ is the half-saturation constant, which is the nutrient concentration at which the growth rate is half of its maximum.\n\nThe ecosystem contains three competitively distinct phytoplankton groups, initially present in equal, low biomass: Diatoms, Dinoflagellates, and Picophytoplankton.

The succession over time corresponds to the change in competitive advantage as $[N]$ decreases from $20.0 \\, \\mu\\text{M}$ towards $0 \\, \\mu\\text{M}$.\n\nLet $N$ represent the nutrient concentration for simplicity. We define the net growth rate functions for each group:\n*   Diatoms: $r_{1}(N) = 1.50 \\frac{N}{4 + N} - 0.30$.\n*   Dinoflagellates: $r_{2}(N) = 0.70 \\frac{N}{0.5 + N} - 0.10$.\n*   Picophytoplankton: $r_{3}(N) = 0.90 \\frac{N}{1 + N} - 0.15$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the competition at very high nutrient concentrations ($N \\to \\infty$).

This eliminates options B and D. At $N=20.0$, all growth rates are positive, eliminating option E.\n\nTo determine the succession as nutrients decline, we find the crossover points by solving for the nutrient concentrations where the net growth rates of two groups are equal (e.g., $r_i(N) = r_j(N)$).\n\n1.

As time passes and nutrients are consumed, the concentration will fall. It will pass through a phase where Picophytoplankton are dominant, and finally, at low nutrient levels, it will enter a phase where Dinoflagellates are the superior competitors.\n\nThe statement that best describes this overall succession is that Diatoms are superior initially, and as nutrients become depleted, Dinoflagellates eventually become the superior competitors.
