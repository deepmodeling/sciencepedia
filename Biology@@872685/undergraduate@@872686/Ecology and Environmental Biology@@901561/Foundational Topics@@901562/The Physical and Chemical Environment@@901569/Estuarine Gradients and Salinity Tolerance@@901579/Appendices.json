This first practice explores the fundamental relationship between an organism's metabolic rate and the salinity of its environment. By analyzing physiological data, you will learn to identify the 'isosmotic point'—the salinity at which an organism is in perfect balance and expends the least energy on osmoregulation, a key concept for understanding estuarine life [@problem_id:1846339].", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the physiological adaptations of a newly discovered species of estuarine crab, *Portunus caeruleus*. The study involves placing individual crabs in controlled laboratory tanks with varying water salinities and measuring their rate of oxygen consumption as a proxy for their metabolic rate. The results show a distinct pattern: the crab's metabolic rate is at its absolute minimum at a salinity of 22 parts per thousand (ppt). When the salinity is either decreased below 22 ppt or increased above 22 ppt, the crab's metabolic rate steadily increases. Based on these physiological data, what does the salinity of 22 ppt most accurately represent for *Portunus caeruleus*?\n\nA. The salinity at which the crab's internal body fluids are isosmotic with the surrounding water.\n\nB. The salinity that marks the crab's upper lethal limit for survival.\n\nC. The average salinity of the open ocean environment from which the crab evolved.\n\nD. The salinity at which the crab switches from being an osmoconformer to an osmoregulator.\n\nE. The salinity that induces a dormant or hibernation-like state to conserve energy.", "solution": "We are told that the crab’s metabolic rate is at an absolute minimum at a salinity of 22 ppt and increases as salinity deviates either below or above 22 ppt. This describes a U-shaped relationship between metabolic rate and environmental salinity.\n\nPrinciple: The total metabolic rate can be decomposed into a baseline component plus an osmoregulatory cost:\n$$\nM(C_{e}) = M_{0} + M_{\\text{osmo}}(C_{e}),\n$$\nwhere $C_{e}$ is the external salinity (expressed in equivalent osmotic units), $M_{0}$ is the baseline maintenance metabolism that is approximately independent of salinity, and $M_{\\text{osmo}}$ is the energetic cost of maintaining internal osmotic and ionic balance. The work required for active ion transport generally increases with the magnitude of the osmotic/ionic gradient between the internal body fluids and the external medium, so we can express this qualitatively as\n$$\nM_{\\text{osmo}}(C_{e}) = f\\big(|C_{e} - C_{i}|\\big),\n$$\nwith $f$ a monotonically increasing function and $C_{i}$ the internal osmotic concentration of the crab’s body fluids.\n\nFrom this, the metabolic rate is minimized when the osmotic gradient is zero:\n$$\n|C_{e} - C_{i}| = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad C_{e} = C_{i}.\n$$\nThe condition $C_{e} = C_{i}$ is the isosmotic condition. Therefore, the observed minimum metabolic rate at 22 ppt indicates that the crab’s internal body fluids are isosmotic to the external medium at 22 ppt.\n\nEliminating alternatives:\n- B (upper lethal limit) is inconsistent with a central minimum; lethal limits occur at extremes where survival fails, not where metabolism is minimized.\n- C (average open ocean salinity) is about 35 ppt and is unrelated to the observed physiological minimum at 22 ppt.\n- D (switch from osmoconformer to osmoregulator) is not necessarily where energetic cost is minimal; the minimum occurs at isosmotic conditions regardless of the regulatory mode on either side.\n- E (dormancy-like state) is not implied by a smooth U-shaped dependence; dormancy is typically a discrete state triggered by multiple cues, not a single salinity minimum with symmetric increases on either side.\n\nHence, the salinity of 22 ppt most accurately represents the isosmotic point for the crab’s body fluids.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1846339"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principle that organisms have an optimal salinity to minimize energy costs, we can predict that mobile animals will actively seek out these conditions.
