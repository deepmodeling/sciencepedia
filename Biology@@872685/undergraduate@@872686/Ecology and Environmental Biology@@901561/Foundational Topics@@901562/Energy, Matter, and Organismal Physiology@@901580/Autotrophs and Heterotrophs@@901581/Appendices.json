This practice focuses on the fundamental energy budget of autotrophs, distinguishing between the total energy captured through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis (Gross Primary Production, or $GPP$) and the energy that remains for heterotrophs after the producers' own metabolic needs are met (Net Primary Production, or $NPP$). By working through this problem, you will apply the core equation $NPP = GPP - R_a$ to determine the total energy input into a controlled ecosystem, a crucial first step in any ecological energy analysis [@problem_id:1831536].", "problem": "In an experimental, closed-system biosphere designed for long-term space missions, a species of genetically engineered algae serves as the primary producer. The Net Primary Production (NPP) of this algal community, which represents the energy stored as new biomass and made available to the first level of heterotrophs, is measured to be $4,500$ kcal/m$^2$/year. Bio-monitoring reveals that the algae's own metabolic activities, defined as autotrophic respiration ($R_a$), consistently consume an amount of energy equivalent to 40% of the system's Gross Primary Production (GPP). The GPP is the total rate at which the algae capture and store chemical energy.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the total Gross Primary Production (GPP) of this algal ecosystem. Express your answer in units of kcal/m$^2$/year.", "solution": "Net primary production (NPP), gross primary production (GPP), and autotrophic respiration ($R_{a}$) are related by the energy balance\n$$\n\\text{NPP} = \\text{GPP} - R_{a}.\n$$\nThe problem states that autotrophic respiration consumes 40 percent of GPP, which we represent as a fraction to maintain exactness:\n$$\nR_{a} = \\frac{2}{5}\\,\\text{GPP}.\n$$\nSubstituting this into the NPP relation gives\n$$\n\\text{NPP} = \\text{GPP} - \\frac{2}{5}\\,\\text{GPP} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{5}\\right)\\text{GPP} = \\frac{3}{5}\\,\\text{GPP}.\n$$\nSolving for GPP in terms of NPP,\n$$\n\\text{GPP} = \\frac{5}{3}\\,\\text{NPP}.\n$$\nWith the given $\\text{NPP} = 4500$ kcal/m$^{2}$/year, we obtain\n$$\n\\text{GPP} = \\frac{5}{3}\\times 4500 = 5\\times 1500 = 7500.\n$$\nThus, the gross primary production is 7500 kcal/m$^{2}$/year.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7500}$$", "id": "1831536"}, {"introduction": "Once energy is fixed by autotrophs, it flows to heterotrophs through various trophic levels. However, this transfer is notoriously inefficient, a concept often simplified by the \"10% rule.\" This exercise demonstrates how the laws of thermodynamics govern the structure of food chains, leading to a dramatic decrease in available energy at each successive level. Calculating the energy that reaches the top of a food chain from its base will solidify your understanding of the energy pyramid and why populations of apex predators are naturally limited [@problem_id:1831530].", "problem": "In a simplified aquatic ecosystem, phytoplankton serve as the autotrophic producers. They are consumed by zooplankton (primary consumers), which are in turn consumed by small fish (secondary consumers). Finally, a species of larger predatory fish acts as the tertiary consumer by feeding on the small fish. Field measurements indicate that the total chemical energy stored in the phytoplankton biomass within a specific volume of the ecosystem is $25,000$ Joules. Assuming that the efficiency of energy transfer between each successive trophic level is exactly $10\\%$, calculate the total amount of energy available to the population of tertiary consumers from this food chain. Express your answer in Joules.", "solution": "Energy flow through trophic levels follows the principle of ecological transfer efficiency: only a fixed fraction of energy at one trophic level is available to the next. If the transfer efficiency is denoted by $\\eta$, then after $n$ transfers the available energy is multiplied by $\\eta^{n}$.\n\nGiven producer energy $E_{\\text{producers}}=25000$ and transfer efficiency $\\eta=\\frac{1}{10}$ for each step, there are three transfers to reach the tertiary consumers (producers $\\to$ primary $\\to$ secondary $\\to$ tertiary).

It presents a thought experiment involving a closed ecosystem populated only by heterotrophs to challenge your understanding of energy flow versus nutrient cycling. By analyzing this hypothetical scenario, you will confront the second law of thermodynamics as it applies to biology, grasping why the continuous input of energy by autotrophs is non-negotiable for the long-term persistence of any ecosystem [@problem_id:1831483].", "problem": "An advanced bio-engineering project creates a perfectly sealed and isolated terrestrial biome called \"Erebus-1\". This system is completely cut off from all external energy and matter exchange, meaning no sunlight can penetrate its walls and no substances can enter or leave. The initial environment within Erebus-1 contains an atmosphere (with oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide), liquid water, a sterile mineral substrate, and a large, finite supply of non-living organic matter (detritus).\n\nInto this environment, scientists introduce a complex community of organisms consisting exclusively of heterotrophs: a variety of animals, fungi, and heterotrophic bacteria. No autotrophic organisms, such as plants or chemosynthetic bacteria, are included.\n\nAssuming the initial conditions are suitable for the survival and reproduction of these organisms, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the long-term fate of the community within Erebus-1?\n\nA. The community will thrive indefinitely, as the decomposers will efficiently recycle all nutrients from waste products and dead organisms, creating a stable, self-sustaining loop.\n\nB. The community will eventually decline and perish, as the total usable energy in the system will steadily decrease with each metabolic transaction due to inescapable heat loss, and there is no primary energy source to replenish it.\n\nC. The community will survive by having some of its members rapidly evolve the ability to perform chemosynthesis, using the inorganic minerals in the substrate to generate new organic energy for the ecosystem.\n\nD. The community will thrive for a very long time but eventually collapse due to the depletion of atmospheric oxygen, which, once used for respiration, cannot be regenerated.\n\nE. The community will reach a stable equilibrium where the rate of consumption by animals is perfectly balanced by the rate of decomposition by fungi and bacteria, allowing the total biomass to remain constant indefinitely.", "solution": "We model Erebus-1 as an isolated thermodynamic system: no exchange of matter or energy with the surroundings. By the first and second laws of thermodynamics,\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dt}=0, \\qquad \\frac{dS}{dt}\\ge 0,\n$$\nwhere $U$ is internal energy and $S$ is entropy. The organisms are exclusively heterotrophs that can extract work only by oxidizing the finite stock of organic detritus with available electron acceptors (primarily $O_{2}$ initially). A representative net catabolic reaction is\n$$\n\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{O}+O_{2}\\rightarrow CO_{2}+H_{2}O, \\qquad \\Delta G_{r}<0,\n$$\nor, for average detritus composition $C_{a}H_{b}O_{c}N_{d}$,\n$$\nC_{a}H_{b}O_{c}N_{d}+\\nu O_{2}\\rightarrow a\\,CO_{2}+\\frac{b-3d}{2}\\,H_{2}O+d\\,NH_{3},\n$$\nwith $\\nu=a+\\frac{b}{4}-\\frac{c}{2}-\\frac{3d}{4}$. This consumes $O_{2}$ and converts high free-energy substrates to low free-energy products. Let $E_{\\text{chem}}(t)$ denote the total chemical free energy (exergy) stored in the detritus plus oxidants relative to the equilibrium mixture. Metabolic power satisfies\n$$\n\\frac{dE_{\\text{chem}}}{dt}=-P_{\\text{met}}(t), \\qquad P_{\\text{met}}(t)=\\dot{W}(t)+\\dot{Q}(t), \\qquad 0<\\eta(t)=\\frac{\\dot{W}(t)}{P_{\\text{met}}(t)}<1,\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{W}$ is biological work rate, $\\dot{Q}$ is heat dissipation, and $\\eta$ is metabolic efficiency. Because $E_{\\text{chem}}(0)$ is finite (finite detritus and finite oxidants), and $P_{\\text{met}}(t)\\ge 0$ whenever organisms are active, $E_{\\text{chem}}(t)$ decreases monotonically and is exhausted in finite total time integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty}P_{\\text{met}}(t)\\,dt=E_{\\text{chem}}(0),\n$$\nso eventually $E_{\\text{chem}}\\to 0$ and thus $\\dot{W}\\to 0$, causing maintenance and reproduction to fail and the community to perish. In an isolated system, $\\dot{Q}>0$ cannot be exported; it increases $S$ and leaves $U$ constant, but it cannot regenerate chemical free energy. Consequently, each trophic or decomposer transformation irreversibly dissipates energy. For any closed loop of transformations with efficiencies $\\eta_{i}<1$,\n$$\n\\eta_{\\text{cycle}}=\\prod_{i}\\eta_{i}<1,\n$$\nso a putative perfect recycling loop necessarily loses free energy each cycle, forbidding indefinite sustainment without external energy input, directly by the second law.\n\nMatter balances reinforce this: for community-scale respiration rate $R(t)\\ge 0$,\n$$\n\\frac{d[O_{2}]}{dt}=-\\nu R(t)<0, \\qquad \\frac{d[CO_{2}]}{dt}>0,\n$$\nand without autotrophy there is no pathway to regenerate $O_{2}$ from $CO_{2}$. Oxygen depletion may further accelerate collapse, but even if alternative electron acceptors were present, their finite pools also bound $E_{\\text{chem}}$ and are exhausted in the same sense.\n\nTherefore:\n- A and E are false because nutrient recycling cannot recycle free energy; total usable energy declines with unavoidable heat dissipation.\n- C is false because evolution cannot conjure a new external energy source in an isolated system; any chemosynthetic route would still be limited by finite redox gradients and would constitute autotrophy absent at the outset.\n- D identifies a real symptom (oxygen depletion) but is not the fundamental, most general driver; collapse is dictated by the steady decrease of total usable energy in an isolated system.\n\nThe most accurate prediction is that the community will ultimately decline and perish due to the irreversible depletion of usable chemical free energy in the absence of any primary energy source.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1831483"}]}
