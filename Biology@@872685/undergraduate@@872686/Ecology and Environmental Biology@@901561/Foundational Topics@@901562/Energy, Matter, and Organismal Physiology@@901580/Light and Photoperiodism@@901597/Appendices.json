This first practice places you in the role of a scientist tasked with classifying a newly discovered plant species. By analyzing a set of experimental results, you will learn to distinguish between short-day, long-day, and day-neutral plants, focusing on how the length of the uninterrupted dark period and the effect of a \"night-break\" flash provide the crucial clues [@problem_id:1860579].", "problem": "An ecologist discovers a new flowering plant species, *Planta incognita*, on a remote island. To understand its reproductive strategy, the ecologist conducts a series of experiments in controlled environmental chambers to classify its photoperiodism. The plant's response to different light and dark cycles is recorded in the table below. The \"Special Conditions\" column notes any interruption to the standard 24-hour light/dark cycle.\n\n| Experiment | Light Period (hours) | Dark Period (hours) | Special Conditions | Result |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 1 | 10 | 14 | None | Flowering |\n| 2 | 13 | 11 | None | Vegetative Growth |\n| 3 | 10 | 14 | A 1-hour flash of light applied in the middle of the dark period. | Vegetative Growth |\n| 4 | 11 | 13 | None | Flowering |\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following statements most accurately classifies *Planta incognita*?\n\nA. Long-day plant with a critical night length of 12 hours.\n\nB. Short-day plant with a critical night length of 11 hours.\n\nC. Day-neutral plant.\n\nD. Short-day plant with a critical night length of 12 hours.\n\nE. Long-day plant with a critical day length of 10 hours.", "solution": "Define $N$ as the continuous dark (night) length and $N_{c}$ as the critical night length. Photoperiodic principles:\n- Short-day (long-night) plants flower if and only if $N \\geq N_{c}$ and the night is not interrupted by light.\n- Long-day (short-night) plants flower if and only if $N \\leq N_{c}$, and a night break (light flash) can promote flowering by effectively shortening the night.\n- Day-neutral plants do not change flowering with photoperiod.\n\nAnalyze each experiment:\n\n1) Experiment 1: $N=14$ (uninterrupted), result: Flowering. This is consistent with a short-day plant with $N_{c} \\leq 14$. For a long-day plant, flowering at $N=14$ would require $N_{c} \\geq 14$.\n\n2) Experiment 2: $N=11$ (uninterrupted), result: Vegetative Growth. For a short-day plant, lack of flowering implies $N  N_{c}$, so $N_{c}  11$. For a long-day plant with $N_{c} \\geq 14$ (from Experiment 1), we would predict flowering at $N=11$ because $11 \\leq N_{c}$, which contradicts the result. Hence, the long-day classification is ruled out. Day-neutral is also ruled out because responses differ across photoperiods.\n\n3) Experiment 3: $N=14$ with a 1-hour light flash mid-night, result: Vegetative Growth. In short-day plants, a night interruption prevents the required continuous dark, effectively splitting the night into two shorter dark intervals (e.g., $7$ and $7$ hours), each less than $N_{c}$, suppressing flowering. This is the hallmark diagnostic of a short-day plant. In long-day plants, a night break often promotes flowering, which does not match the observed vegetative outcome under the long night.\n\n4) Experiment 4: $N=13$ (uninterrupted), result: Flowering. This further constrains for a short-day plant that $N_{c} \\leq 13$.\n\nCombine inequalities from Experiments 2 and 4:\n$$11  N_{c} \\leq 13.$$\nA critical night length of $12$ hours is consistent with all observations: flowering when $N \\geq 12$ and uninterrupted (Experiments 1 and 4), no flowering when $N=11$ (Experiment 2), and loss of flowering when a $14$-hour night is interrupted (Experiment 3). Therefore, the plant is a short-day plant with $N_{c}$ near $12$ hours.\n\nAmong the options, this corresponds to statement D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1860579"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of photoperiodism lies a remarkable molecular switch: the phytochrome pigment system. This exercise challenges you to predict a flowering outcome based on the precise sequence of light flashes interrupting the night, testing your grasp of photoreversibility. By working through this scenario, you will solidify your understanding of how the \"last light wins\" principle determines the plant's physiological state and its decision to flower [@problem_id:1766706].", "problem": "A team of horticulturalists is studying the flowering mechanism of *Chrysanthemum morifolium*, a classic short-day plant (SDP). This species is known to require a continuous dark period that exceeds a critical night length of 9.5 hours to initiate flowering. The plants are cultivated in an environmentally controlled growth chamber under a photoperiod consisting of 8 hours of light followed by 16 hours of darkness, a condition that reliably induces flowering.\n\nIn a specific experiment, a group of these plants is subjected to the same 8-hour light / 16-hour dark cycle. However, exactly at the midpoint of the 16-hour dark period, the plants are exposed to a rapid sequence of three brief, high-intensity light flashes. The sequence is as follows:\n1. A flash of red light (R, wavelength ~660 nm).\n2. Immediately followed by a flash of far-red light (FR, wavelength ~730 nm).\n3. Immediately followed by a final flash of red light (R).\n\nBased on the established phytochrome model of photoperiodic timekeeping, what is the expected flowering outcome for this experimental group of plants?\n\nA. The plants will flower, as the far-red light flash effectively reversed the effect of the first red light flash, rendering the sequence neutral.\n\nB. The plants will not flower, because the final flash of red light leaves the phytochrome in its biologically active, flower-inhibiting form.\n\nC. The plants will flower, as the total duration of the light flashes is negligible compared to the length of the dark period.\n\nD. The plants will not flower, because any interruption of the required dark period, regardless of the quality of light, inhibits flowering in short-day plants.\n\nE. The flowering response cannot be determined, as the rapid sequence of opposing light signals creates a conflicting state in the phytochrome system.", "solution": "We model the phytochrome system with two interconvertible forms: $P_{r}$ (red-absorbing, inactive for short-day flowering) and $P_{fr}$ (far-red-absorbing, biologically active for inhibiting flowering in short-day plants). The photoconversions follow:\n$$P_{r} \\xrightarrow{\\text{R}} P_{fr}, \\quad P_{fr} \\xrightarrow{\\text{FR}} P_{r}, \\quad P_{fr} \\xrightarrow{\\text{dark}} P_{r}.$$\nFor a short-day plant, flowering requires a continuous dark interval exceeding the critical night length during which the level of $P_{fr}$ remains below an inhibitory threshold. Let the inhibitory threshold be $\\theta$ and denote the instantaneous level of the active form by $[P_{fr}]$. The night-break phenomenon is triggered when a flash of red light during the dark period converts $P_{r}$ to $P_{fr}$ such that $[P_{fr}]$ exceeds $\\theta$, thereby inhibiting flowering; a subsequent far-red flash can reverse this effect by converting $P_{fr}$ back to $P_{r}$, reducing $[P_{fr}]$ below $\\theta$. The outcome of a rapid R/FR sequence is therefore determined by the last effective flash, because the photoconversion is reversible and saturable on short time scales relative to the dark period.\n\nUnder the control condition (8 hours light / 16 hours dark), the continuous dark of 16 hours exceeds the critical 9.5 hours, so $[P_{fr}]$ decays via dark reversion, remaining below $\\theta$ and inducing flowering. In the experiment, at the midpoint of the dark period, the plants receive a rapid sequence R, then FR, then R. At mid-dark, prior to the flashes, dark reversion ensures $[P_{fr}]$ is low relative to $\\theta$. The flash sequence produces the following state transitions:\n1. First R flash: $P_{r} \\to P_{fr}$, so $[P_{fr}]$ increases above $\\theta$ (night-break inhibition).\n2. Subsequent FR flash: $P_{fr} \\to P_{r}$, undoing the red effect so that $[P_{fr}]$ falls below $\\theta$ (cancels inhibition).\n3. Final R flash: $P_{r} \\to P_{fr}$ again, restoring high $[P_{fr}]$ above $\\theta$ at the conclusion of the sequence (reinstating inhibition).\n\nBecause even brief flashes can act as an effective night break and the last flash is red, the phytochrome pool is left predominantly as $P_{fr}$ at the critical moment, which inhibits flowering in a short-day plant despite the overall long dark duration. Therefore, the plants will not flower. This corresponds to option B and rules out the other options: A ignores the final red flash, C ignores the potency of night-break flashes, D ignores wavelength-specific reversibility, and E is incorrect because the phytochrome model makes a clear prediction based on the last flash being red.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1766706"}, {"introduction": "A plant's response to photoperiod is not a localized event but a coordinated, organism-wide process. This final practice explores the crucial question of where the light stimulus is perceived and how that signal is transmitted to induce flowering at the shoot apex. This thought experiment, based on classic findings in plant physiology, will introduce you to the concept of a mobile flowering hormone, often called florigen, which communicates the message from leaf to bud [@problem_id:1766684].", "problem": "A botanist is studying photoperiodism in a specific variety of soybean, which is classified as a short-day plant (SDP). A short-day plant is an organism that flowers only when the length of the night period exceeds a certain critical duration. For this particular soybean variety, the critical night length required to initiate flowering is 12 hours.\n\nThe botanist conducts an experiment using a healthy, mature plant that is still in its vegetative (non-flowering) stage. The entire plant, except for one single, fully expanded leaf, is kept in a growth chamber under a non-inductive light cycle consisting of 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness each day.\n\nThe single, selected leaf is carefully enclosed in a light-proof, breathable bag. This bag is applied and removed daily so that this specific leaf experiences an inductive light cycle of 8 hours of light and 16 hours of darkness. The experimental conditions are maintained for several weeks, and all other factors such as temperature, water, and nutrients are kept at optimal levels for growth and flowering.\n\nBased on the established principles of plant physiology, which of the following outcomes is the most likely?\n\nA. The plant will not flower because the vast majority of its leaves are exposed to non-inductive short-night conditions.\n\nB. The plant will flower because the photoperiodic stimulus is perceived by the leaf and the resulting signal is transmissible to the flowering sites.\n\nC. The plant will develop a single flower at the axil of the covered leaf, but the rest of the plant will remain vegetative.\n\nD. The plant will not flower because a single leaf cannot produce a strong enough flowering signal to affect the entire plant.\n\nE. The outcome cannot be determined because the inhibition from the non-induced leaves will counteract the promotion from the single induced leaf.", "solution": "A short-day plant requires that the uninterrupted night length exceed a critical duration to initiate flowering. For the given soybean, the critical night length is 12 hours, so any organ perceiving a night of at least 12 hours is under inductive conditions, while shorter nights are non-inductive.\n\nPhotoperiodic perception occurs in leaves. When a leaf of a short-day plant experiences inductive long nights, it produces a transmissible flowering signal (classically termed florigen, molecularly associated with FT-like proteins), which is transported via the phloem to the shoot apical meristems where it induces flowering. This signal is systemic and not confined to the vicinity of the induced leaf. Classic experiments have shown that even a single induced leaf can generate sufficient florigen to induce flowering in an otherwise non-induced plant, and non-induced leaves do not generate a counteracting inhibitory signal that would negate the florigen effect.\n\nApplying these principles to the experiment: the whole plant is under non-inductive 16 hours light and 8 hours dark, except one leaf that is bagged to experience 8 hours light and 16 hours dark. The bagged leaf thus experiences nights longer than the 12-hour critical night length and becomes induced. Over several weeks, this induced leaf will produce florigen, which will move to the shoot apices and trigger flowering of the plant. The effect is not restricted to the axil of the covered leaf, and inhibition from the non-induced leaves is not expected to prevent flowering.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that the plant will flower because the photoperiodic stimulus is perceived by the leaf and the resulting signal is transmissible to the flowering sites.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A is incorrect because one induced leaf can suffice to induce flowering.\n- B is correct for the reasons above.\n- C is incorrect because the signal is systemic, not local to a single axil.\n- D is incorrect because a single leaf can produce sufficient florigen.\n- E is incorrect because there is no general inhibitory effect from non-induced leaves that cancels florigen.\n\nThus, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1766684"}]}
