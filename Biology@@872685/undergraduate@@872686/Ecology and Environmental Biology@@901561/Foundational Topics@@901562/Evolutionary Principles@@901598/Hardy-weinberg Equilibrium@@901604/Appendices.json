This exercise provides hands-on practice with this fundamental skill, using a hypothetical sample of snails to show how to calculate the frequency of an allele directly from observed genotype counts. Mastering this calculation is essential for any further application of the Hardy-Weinberg principle. [@problem_id:1852850]", "problem": "A team of marine biologists is studying a newly discovered species of hydrothermal vent snail. They observe that the snails exhibit two distinct shell phenotypes: a thick, dark shell and a thinner, lighter shell. Genetic analysis reveals that this trait is controlled by a single gene with two alleles: a dominant allele, $T$, which codes for the thick shell, and a recessive allele, $t$, which codes for the thin shell. In a large, isolated vent field, the biologists collect a random sample of 500 snails. After genotyping each snail, they find the following distribution: 180 individuals are homozygous dominant ($TT$), 240 are heterozygous ($Tt$), and 80 are homozygous recessive ($tt$).\n\nBased on this sample, what is the frequency of the recessive allele, $t$? Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "Let $n_{TT}=180$, $n_{Tt}=240$, $n_{tt}=80$, and $N=500$ denote the genotype counts and total sample size. In a diploid population, the total number of alleles is $2N$. The number of recessive alleles $t$ present is $2n_{tt}+n_{Tt}$ because each $tt$ individual contributes two $t$ alleles and each $Tt$ individual contributes one $t$ allele. Therefore, the recessive allele frequency $q$ is\n$$\nq=\\frac{2n_{tt}+n_{Tt}}{2N}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given counts,\n$$\nq=\\frac{2\\cdot 80+240}{2\\cdot 500}=\\frac{160+240}{1000}=\\frac{400}{1000}=0.4.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4}$$", "id": "1852850"}, {"introduction": "Once allele frequencies are known, the true power of the Hardy-Weinberg principle emerges: its ability to predict the expected genotype frequencies for the next generation, assuming equilibrium conditions hold.
