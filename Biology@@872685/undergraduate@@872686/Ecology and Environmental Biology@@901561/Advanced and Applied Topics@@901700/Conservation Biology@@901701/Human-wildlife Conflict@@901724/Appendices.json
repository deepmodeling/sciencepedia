The university's buildings are classified into three distinct categories based on their size and typical usage patterns.\n\nThe research group has compiled the following data:\n\n1.  **Low-Rise Academic Buildings:** There are $N_L = 40$ of these buildings. Each has an average window surface area of $A_L = 350$ square meters. The estimated bird-strike mortality rate for this building type is $M_L = 0.85$ fatalities per square meter per year.\n\n2.  **Mid-Rise Residential Halls:** There are $N_M = 12$ of these dormitories.

This exercise connects the core ecological concept of carrying capacity ($K$) to a real-world management scenario. By modeling how a gull population might change after a landfill closure, you will practice predicting the large-scale ecological consequences of management decisions, a critical skill for conservation and urban planning [@problem_id:1853643].", "problem": "A coastal city's primary landfill site provides a significant, artificial food source for a large population of Silver Gulls (*Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae*). Ecological studies have determined that the gull population in the area is currently stable and can be described by a logistic growth model. The current carrying capacity, $K_{current}$, for the gulls is 15,000 individuals. This carrying capacity is sustained by a total of 2,500 kilograms per day of accessible food resources from all sources in the region. It is estimated that 80% of this total food resource is directly scavenged from the landfill, with the remainder coming from natural coastal and urban habitats.\n\nThe city has approved a plan to permanently close the landfill. As part of an environmental remediation project, a new 50-hectare coastal wetland will be established nearby. This new wetland is projected to create a stable, natural food source providing 350 kilograms per day of accessible food for the gulls.\n\nAssuming that the carrying capacity of the gull population is directly proportional to the total daily mass of available food resources, calculate the new carrying capacity, $K_{new}$, for the Silver Gull population after the landfill is closed and the new wetland is established.
