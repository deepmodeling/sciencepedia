The boundary of a reserve is a zone of interaction with the surrounding landscape, often leading to \"edge effects\" that can reduce habitat quality for interior-specialist species. This first exercise provides a quantitative look at this principle by comparing the amount of protected \"core\" habitat in two reserves of identical area but different shapes, demonstrating why a lower perimeter-to-area ratio is often a key objective in reserve design [@problem_id:1854171].", "problem": "A conservation organization is planning to establish a new nature reserve with a total area of $144 \\text{ km}^2$.

These effects penetrate a uniform distance, $d = 0.25 \\text{ km}$, from every edge of a reserve. The area unaffected by these edge effects is known as the \"core habitat,\" which is crucial for the survival of sensitive interior species.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the core habitat area of the square-shaped reserve to the core habitat area of the rectangular riparian reserve.
