Initially, it is composed entirely of moss-and-shrub-dominated tundra, which has a baseline net sequestration rate, $S_{moss}$, of 20.0 kg of carbon per hectare per year.\n\nThe reintroduction of the Borean Grazer is predicted to have two primary, independent effects on the ecosystem's carbon cycle:\n\n1.  **Vegetation Shift**: The grazers' activity gradually converts the moss-shrub tundra into a grassland-steppe ecosystem. This conversion occurs at a constant rate, $r_{conv}$, where a fraction of 0.00500 of the total preserve area is converted each year. The resulting grassland-steppe has a higher net sequestration rate, $S_{grass}$, of 150.0 kg of carbon per hectare per year. Assume the conversion process is linear and that once an area is converted, it immediately adopts the sequestration rate of grassland.\n\n2.  **Permafrost Insulation**: Throughout the winter, the grazers trample the snowpack across the entire preserve. This compaction reduces the snow's insulating properties, leading to deeper and more intense freezing of the soil. This effect suppresses microbial activity and significantly reduces carbon loss from winter soil respiration. This mechanism provides an additional net carbon sink, $S_{trample}$, equivalent to 50.0 kg of carbon per hectare per year, which applies across the entire area $A$ of the preserve, starting from the moment the grazers are introduced.\n\nYour task is to calculate the total net change in the carbon stock of the preserve after a period, $T$, of 50.0 years.
