This exercise will guide you through calculating $N_e$ in a common scenario where the number of breeding males and females is unequal, a crucial first step in assessing genetic risks [@problem_id:2309247].", "problem": "A conservation team has established a captive breeding program for the critically endangered Quokka, a small wallaby-like marsupial. The founding population, which is the entire group available for breeding in the first generation, consists of a total of 150 individuals. However, the sex ratio is heavily skewed, with only 25 breeding males (boomers) and 125 breeding females (jills). A key metric for assessing the genetic health and risk of inbreeding in such a population is the effective population size, denoted as $N_e$. This value represents the size of an idealized population that would experience the same magnitude of genetic drift as the actual population. Given the number of breeding males and females, calculate the effective population size ($N_e$) for this founding group.

A small or fluctuating $N_e$ accelerates the loss of genetic diversity—the raw material for adaptation—which can increase a population's vulnerability to future environmental changes. This practice asks you to quantify the erosion of heterozygosity over several generations, demonstrating how genetic drift can systematically reduce a population's resilience [@problem_id:1874390].", "problem": "A conservation program established a new island population of the critically endangered Blue-crested Anole (*Anolis cyaneus*) using a small group of founders. Over the first five years, which corresponds to five generations for this species, annual monitoring provided estimates of the effective population size ($N_e$). The estimated values were 10, 8, 12, 6, and 15 for generations one through five, respectively. Assuming genetic drift is the only significant evolutionary force acting on the population, calculate the total proportion of the original genetic diversity lost from the population by the end of the fifth generation.
