{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The central goal of defining a Minimum Viable Population (MVP) is to ensure the long-term persistence of a species by preserving its genetic health. Small populations are particularly susceptible to the loss of genetic diversity through a random process called genetic drift. This exercise provides a foundational calculation to quantify this risk, connecting population size directly to the erosion of genetic variation. By working through this problem [@problem_id:1947176], you will calculate the expected loss of heterozygosity in a single generation for a small, newly founded population, revealing the immediate genetic cost of a population bottleneck.", "problem": "A conservation biology team is undertaking a captive breeding program for the critically endangered Iberian lynx. They establish a new, isolated population with a founding group of 20 individuals. For the purpose of a simplified initial model, assume this new population behaves as an ideal diploid population, meaning it exhibits random mating, a 1:1 sex ratio, non-overlapping generations, and that there is no selection, mutation, or migration occurring. Under these idealized conditions, calculate the fraction of the initial genetic heterozygosity that is expected to be lost after exactly one generation due to genetic drift. Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "In a Wright-Fisher ideal diploid population, the expected heterozygosity follows the recursion\n$$\nH_{t+1} = H_{t}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_{e}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $N_{e}$ is the effective population size. The fraction of initial heterozygosity lost in one generation is therefore\n$$\n1 - \\frac{H_{1}}{H_{0}} = \\frac{1}{2N_{e}}.\n$$\nFor an ideal population with a 1:1 sex ratio and random mating, the effective size equals the census size. Using the standard sex-ratio formula,\n$$\nN_{e} = \\frac{4N_{m}N_{f}}{N_{m}+N_{f}},\n$$\nwith $N_{m}=10$ and $N_{f}=10$, gives $N_{e}=20$. Hence,\n$$\n1 - \\frac{H_{1}}{H_{0}} = \\frac{1}{2\\cdot 20} = \\frac{1}{40} = 0.025.\n$$\nThus, the fraction of initial heterozygosity lost after one generation is $0.025$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.025}$$", "id": "1947176"}, {"introduction": "While the total number of individuals in a population (census size, $N_c$) is easy to grasp, it's often a poor predictor of genetic outcomes. A more accurate measure is the effective population size ($N_e$), which represents the size of an idealized population that would experience the same amount of genetic drift. This practice [@problem_id:1947207] explores one of the most common reasons for a discrepancy between $N_c$ and $N_e$: an unequal number of breeding males and females. Understanding this calculation is crucial for accurately assessing a population's vulnerability, as social structures and mating systems can dramatically reduce its genetic resilience.", "problem": "A team of marine biologists is studying an isolated population of a recently discovered species of deep-sea anglerfish, *Cryptospectrus luminosus*. The total observed population, or census size ($N_c$), is counted to be 120 individuals. In this species, mating is highly selective due to intense competition among males. Over a full breeding season, the research team's underwater drones observe that only 8 males successfully mate with the females. In contrast, 62 females in the population are found to carry fertilized eggs, indicating they have successfully reproduced. The remaining individuals in the population do not participate in breeding during this season.\n\nThe genetic health and susceptibility of a population to phenomena like genetic drift are more accurately reflected by its Effective Population Size ($N_e$) than by its simple census size. Calculate the effective population size for this *Cryptospectrus luminosus* population.\n\nProvide your answer as a number rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The effective population size for a dioecious species with unequal numbers of breeding males and females is given by Wright’s sex-ratio formula:\n$$\nN_{e}=\\frac{4N_{m}N_{f}}{N_{m}+N_{f}}.\n$$\nHere, the number of breeding males is $N_{m}=8$ and the number of breeding females is $N_{f}=62$.

These fluctuations, especially sharp declines known as bottlenecks, have a profound impact on a population's long-term genetic health. The long-term effective population size is not a simple average but is instead governed by the harmonic mean of the sizes in each generation. This exercise [@problem_id:1864917] demonstrates the powerful and lasting influence of bottlenecks, showing how a single year with a low effective population size can disproportionately reduce the overall genetic stability of a population over many generations.", "problem": "A conservation team is managing a captive breeding program for a critically endangered species. The team monitors the genetic health of the population by calculating the effective population size ($N_e$), which represents the size of an idealized population that would experience the same amount of genetic drift.
