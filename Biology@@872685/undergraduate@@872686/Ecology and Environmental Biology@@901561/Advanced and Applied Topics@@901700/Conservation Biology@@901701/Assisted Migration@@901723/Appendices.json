With limited resources, deciding which species to prioritize for a high-effort strategy like assisted migration requires a strong ethical and ecological framework. This exercise [@problem_id:1831284] presents a classic conservation dilemma, forcing you to look beyond a species' charisma and consider its functional role within the ecosystem, a core tenet of modern conservation biology.", "problem": "A conservation agency, the Global Climate Adaptation Fund (GCAF), has a grant to fund one of two competing assisted migration projects for species impacted by climate change. The resources are sufficient to fund only one project.\n\nProject 1 concerns the Frost-Tailed Pika (*Ochotona crystallina*), a small, charismatic mammal whose high-altitude alpine meadow habitat is rapidly shrinking due to warming temperatures. The pika is a beloved local icon with high potential to generate ecotourism revenue, which could in turn fund future conservation efforts. Its ecological role is that of a primary herbivore and a prey animal, but other species in its habitat fill similar niches. The proposed translocation project has an estimated 60% chance of successfully establishing a new, viable population in a suitable location.\n\nProject 2 concerns the Bedrock Lichen (*Rhizocarpon glacialis*), a primary colonizing species on bare rock surfaces recently exposed by retreating glaciers. This lichen initiates primary succession by chemically weathering the rock to create the first layer of soil. This process is the critical foundation for the entire ecosystem that follows, from plants to insects to birds. Without this specific lichen, the newly exposed landscape would remain barren for centuries longer than it would otherwise. The lichen has no public recognition or direct economic value. This project has an estimated 90% chance of success.\n\nThe GCAF's decision-making team is deeply divided. A decision to prioritize the Bedrock Lichen over the Frost-Tailed Pika would be most strongly and fundamentally justified by which of the following conservation principles?\n\nA. Triage Principle: Prioritizing species or projects with the highest likelihood of success to ensure the most efficient use of limited conservation resources, regardless of other factors.\n\nB. Anthropocentric Utilitarianism: Prioritizing species that provide the greatest measurable good—such as economic, aesthetic, or cultural benefits—to the greatest number of people.\n\nC. Ecosystem-Based Management: Prioritizing the health, integrity, and functional processes of the entire ecosystem over the fate of any single species, with special focus on species that have a disproportionately large effect on their environment relative to their abundance (keystone species).\n\nD. Phylogenetic Preservationism: Prioritizing species that are considered more sentient or are more closely related to humans on the evolutionary tree, such as mammals over lichens, based on an intrinsic value hierarchy.", "solution": "We identify the central decision: whether to fund a project for a charismatic mammal with moderate ecological redundancy and a lower probability of assisted migration success, or a poorly recognized lichen with a pivotal, non-redundant role in initiating primary succession and a higher probability of success.\n\nWe evaluate each conservation principle against the facts provided.\n\nFirst, consider anthropocentric utilitarianism. The Frost-Tailed Pika has cultural and economic value via ecotourism, whereas the Bedrock Lichen lacks public recognition or direct economic value. Therefore, anthropocentric utilitarianism would favor the pika, not the lichen. Hence, option B does not justify prioritizing the lichen.\n\nSecond, consider phylogenetic preservationism. This principle elevates taxa closer to humans (e.g., mammals) or perceived as more sentient. This would favor the pika over the lichen. Hence, option D does not justify prioritizing the lichen.\n\nThird, consider the triage principle. This principle prioritizes projects with the higher likelihood of success to maximize efficient use of limited resources, regardless of other factors. Since the lichen project has a higher success probability than the pika project, triage would support the lichen. However, the explicit clause “regardless of other factors” means the choice is justified solely by success probability, not by ecological function. While this principle supports choosing the lichen, it is not the most fundamental justification given the problem’s emphasis on the lichen’s unique and foundational ecological role.\n\nFourth, consider ecosystem-based management. This principle prioritizes the health and functional integrity of entire ecosystems, with special attention to species whose effects are disproportionately large relative to their abundance, such as keystone or foundation species. The Bedrock Lichen is described as initiating primary succession by chemically weathering bare rock to create initial soil, forming the critical foundation for subsequent colonization by plants, insects, and birds. Without it, the landscape remains barren for centuries longer. This is the archetypal case of a foundational or ecosystem-engineering species whose presence enables the assembly and function of an entire ecosystem. Therefore, prioritizing the lichen most strongly and fundamentally aligns with ecosystem-based management, because the choice is justified by maintaining ecosystem processes and structure rather than individual species’ charisma or human-centered benefits.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- B and D would favor the pika and thus do not justify selecting the lichen.\n- A can justify selecting the lichen, but only on success-probability grounds and explicitly “regardless of other factors,” which is less fundamental given the central ecological rationale presented.\n- C directly captures the core ecological reasoning presented, emphasizing ecosystem function and the disproportionate influence of the lichen.\n\nTherefore, the most strongly and fundamentally justified principle is ecosystem-based management.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1831284"}, {"introduction": "Once a species is selected for assisted migration, a critical next step is to project its long-term population trajectory to set realistic expectations for success.
