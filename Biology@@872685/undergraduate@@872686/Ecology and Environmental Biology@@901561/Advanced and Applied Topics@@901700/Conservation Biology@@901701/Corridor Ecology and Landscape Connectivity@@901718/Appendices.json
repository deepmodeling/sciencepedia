Ecologists know that the habitat quality near the boundary of the corridor differs from the interior due to the \"edge effect\". This effect, marked by changes in light, temperature, and wind, penetrates the corridor from each of its two long sides.

Express your answer as a single decimal value.", "solution": "The problem asks for the proportion of the total corridor area that is considered edge habitat. This can be calculated as the ratio of the edge habitat area to the total corridor area.\n\nFirst, we define the necessary areas symbolically. The corridor is a rectangle with length $L$ and width $W$.\nThe total area of the corridor, $A_{\\text{total}}$, is given by:\n$$A_{\\text{total}} = L \\times W$$\n\nThe \"edge effect\" penetrates a distance $d$ from each of the two long sides of the corridor. This means there is a central rectangular region, the \"core habitat,\" that is unaffected. The length of this core region is still $L$, but its width, $W_{\\text{core}}$, is reduced by the penetration depth from both sides.\n$$W_{\\text{core}} = W - 2d$$\n\nThe area of the core habitat, $A_{\\text{core}}$, is therefore:\n$$A_{\\text{core}} = L \\times W_{\\text{core}} = L \\times (W - 2d)$$\n\nThe area of the edge habitat, $A_{\\text{edge}}$, is the total area of the corridor minus the area of the core habitat.\n$$A_{\\text{edge}} = A_{\\text{total}} - A_{\\text{core}}$$\n$$A_{\\text{edge}} = (L \\times W) - (L \\times (W - 2d))$$\n$$A_{\\text{edge}} = LW - LW + 2Ld$$\n$$A_{\\text{edge}} = 2Ld$$\n\nThe proportion of edge habitat, $P_{\\text{edge}}$, is the ratio of the edge habitat area to the total area.\n$$P_{\\text{edge}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{edge}}}{A_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{2Ld}{LW}$$\nBy canceling the common term $L$, we find that the proportion is independent of the corridor's length.\n$$P_{\\text{edge}} = \\frac{2d}{W}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given numerical values into this final expression. We are given:\n- Width of the corridor, $W = 50 \\text{ m}$.\n- Depth of edge effect, $d = 10 \\text{ m}$.\n\n$$P_{\\text{edge}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10 \\text{ m}}{50 \\text{ m}} = \\frac{20}{50} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$$\n\nAlternatively, we can solve the problem by first calculating the numerical areas. It is crucial to use consistent units. Let's convert all length measurements to meters.\n- Length $L = 2.0 \\text{ km} = 2.0 \\times 1000 \\text{ m} = 2000 \\text{ m}$.\n- Width $W = 50 \\text{ m}$.\n- Edge depth $d = 10 \\text{ m}$.\n\nThe total area of the corridor is:\n$$A_{\\text{total}} = L \\times W = 2000 \\text{ m} \\times 50 \\text{ m} = 100000 \\text{ m}^2$$\n\nThe width of the core habitat is:\n$$W_{\\text{core}} = W - 2d = 50 \\text{ m} - 2 \\times 10 \\text{ m} = 30 \\text{ m}$$\n\nThe area of the core habitat is:\n$$A_{\\text{core}} = L \\times W_{\\text{core}} = 2000 \\text{ m} \\times 30 \\text{ m} = 60000 \\text{ m}^2$$\n\nThe area of the edge habitat is:\n$$A_{\\text{edge}} = A_{\\text{total}} - A_{\\text{core}} = 100000 \\text{ m}^2 - 60000 \\text{ m}^2 = 40000 \\text{ m}^2$$\n\nFinally, the proportion of edge habitat is:\n$$P_{\\text{edge}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{edge}}}{A_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{40000 \\text{ m}^2}{100000 \\text{ m}^2} = 0.4$$\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.

The instances where non-target species were detected are explicitly stated to be effective trap-days, as the plates were still functional. Therefore, we only need to subtract the disturbed trap-days from the total.\n\nGiven:\n- Non-effective trap-days ($D_{disturbed}$) = 52\n\nTotal Effective Trap-Days = Total Trap-Days - $D_{disturbed}$\n$$\n\\text{Total Effective Trap-Days} = 560 - 52 = 508\n$$\n\nNow we have all the components to calculate the visitation rate.
