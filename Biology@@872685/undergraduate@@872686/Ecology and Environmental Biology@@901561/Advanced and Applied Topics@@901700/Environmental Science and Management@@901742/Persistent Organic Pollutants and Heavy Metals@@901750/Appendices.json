This is often the primary task of an environmental scientist in the field. This exercise challenges you to think like an investigator, using your knowledge of a pollutant's chemical properties to design a sampling plan that can efficiently pinpoint a source of contamination along a river [@problem_id:1870966]. Mastering this logical approach is fundamental to all environmental assessment and monitoring.", "problem": "An environmental agency is investigating pollution in the Silver Creek river, which flows through the industrial city of Veridia. Analysis of riverbed sediment has revealed that concentrations of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), a class of persistent and toxic industrial chemicals, are low upstream of Veridia but increase significantly and remain high for several kilometers downstream. The agency's working hypothesis is that there is a single, active point source of PCB contamination located along the 2-kilometer stretch of the river that borders the city's old industrial zone. This zone contains several factories and a municipal wastewater treatment plant, all with potential discharge points into the river.\n\nYou are tasked with selecting the most efficient and scientifically sound initial sampling strategy to locate the specific point source of the PCB contamination from the options below. Which of the following proposals describes the best approach?\n\nA. Collect sediment samples at 1 km intervals, starting 10 km downstream of Veridia and moving further away from the city. This will allow for modeling the pollutant's downstream transport and eventual dilution.\n\nB. Collect a large number of sediment samples at random locations all along the 2-kilometer industrial zone stretch and average the concentrations to identify a general \"hotspot\" region.\n\nC. Collect a water sample from the direct outflow of the municipal wastewater treatment plant, as this facility processes industrial effluent and is therefore the most probable single source.\n\nD. Begin sampling at the downstream end of the industrial zone. Systematically move upstream, collecting one sediment sample immediately above and one immediately below each potential discharge outfall (e.g., from each factory and the treatment plant).\n\nE. Collect a series of water samples, rather than sediment, from the center of the river channel at 100-meter intervals along the industrial zone, as this will provide a more immediate snapshot of current discharge activities.", "solution": "Goal: identify a single active point source of PCBs within a 2-kilometer reach that contains multiple discrete outfalls.\n\nKey physical-chemical principle: PCBs are strongly hydrophobic and persistent. Their distribution between water and solids is governed by partitioning, typically expressed as $K_{d} = K_{oc} f_{oc}$, where $K_{oc}$ is the organic carbon normalized partition coefficient and $f_{oc}$ is the fractional organic carbon of the sediment. High $K_{ow}$ compounds like PCBs have large $K_{oc}$, so they preferentially sorb to sediments and accumulate over time. Consequently, sediment concentrations integrate over temporal variability and provide a stable spatial tracer of chronic point discharges, whereas water-phase concentrations can be transient and close to method detection limits.\n\nEfficient diagnostic sampling design: To isolate a specific point source among multiple outfalls, the most informative and efficient approach is to collect paired sediment samples immediately upstream and immediately downstream of each potential discharge point. Let $C_{\\text{up}}$ be the sediment PCB concentration just upstream of an outfall and $C_{\\text{down}}$ the concentration just downstream in the same depositional setting. A true source will produce a positive step change $\\Delta C = C_{\\text{down}} - C_{\\text{up}} > 0$ that is larger than background spatial variability and analytical uncertainty, while non-contributing outfalls will yield $\\Delta C \\approx 0$. Repeating this pairing for each outfall along the 2-kilometer reach systematically tests each candidate source while controlling for longitudinal trends, mixing, and confounders.\n\nWhy the proposed options rank as they do:\n- Option D specifies exactly this paired, bracketed sediment sampling at each outfall while moving systematically along the reach. This directly tests each discrete point source using the appropriate matrix (sediment) for PCBs and yields an unambiguous attribution via the step-change diagnostic $\\Delta C$ for each outfall.\n- Option E relies on water-column sampling at center channel. For PCBs, water-phase concentrations are low and variable; near-bank plumes from unmixed outfalls may not be detected at centerline, and transient signals can obscure chronic sources. It lacks the robust integrating property of sediment and does not isolate individual outfalls.\n- Option C targets only the wastewater treatment plant a priori. This is not comprehensive and risks missing other point sources among the factories.\n- Option B uses random sediment sampling and averaging, which obscures spatial contrasts; averaging across random locations can dilute hotspot signals and cannot attribute a source to a specific outfall.\n- Option A samples far downstream of the suspected reach at coarse spacing, which cannot localize a source within the 2-kilometer zone and mainly reflects transport and dilution, not source identification.\n\nTherefore, the most efficient and scientifically sound initial strategy among the options is the systematic, paired upstream and downstream sediment sampling at each outfall described in Option D, using the step-change criterion $\\Delta C = C_{\\text{down}} - C_{\\text{up}}$ to identify the active point source.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1870966"}, {"introduction": "Once a pollutant is confirmed to be present in an ecosystem, the critical next step is to determine the risk it poses to wildlife.

The average concentration of lead, $C_{Pb}$, in the muscle tissue of the deer carcasses consumed by the condors is $5.0$ micrograms per gram ($\\mu$g/g).\n2.
