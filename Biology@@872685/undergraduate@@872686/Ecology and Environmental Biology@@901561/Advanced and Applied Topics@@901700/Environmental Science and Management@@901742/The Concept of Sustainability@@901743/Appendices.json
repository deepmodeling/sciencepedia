The sustained fishing pressure at the rate $H_{applied}$ creates a strong selection pressure that favors fish that mature earlier and at smaller body sizes. This evolutionary shift degrades the stock's overall reproductive potential. This degradation is modeled as a change in the intrinsic growth rate, $r$.
