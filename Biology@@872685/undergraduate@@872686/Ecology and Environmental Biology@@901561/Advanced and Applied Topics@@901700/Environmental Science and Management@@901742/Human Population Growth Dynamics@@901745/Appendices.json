This practice [@problem_id:1853427] uses a simplified cohort-component model to explore the powerful phenomenon of population momentum.

In this model, the population is divided into three distinct, non-overlapping 25-year age cohorts: a pre-reproductive cohort (ages 0-24), a reproductive cohort (ages 25-49), and a post-reproductive cohort (ages 50-74). The model advances in discrete 25-year time steps.\n\nThe rules for population projection over one 25-year cycle are as follows:\n1.  All individuals in the post-reproductive cohort (50-74) at the beginning of a cycle are assumed to have passed away by the end of the cycle.\n2.  The number of individuals in the new reproductive cohort (25-49) is equal to the number of individuals from the previous pre-reproductive cohort (0-24) who survive. The survival rate for this transition, $S_1$, is 0.98.\n3.  The number of individuals in the new post-reproductive cohort (50-74) is equal to the number of individuals from the previous reproductive cohort (25-49) who survive. The survival rate for this transition, $S_2$, is 0.90.\n4.  The new pre-reproductive cohort (0-24) consists entirely of the children born during the 25-year cycle. The number of births is determined by the reproductive cohort (25-49). Assume a constant 1:1 sex ratio across all age groups.\n\nBoth countries currently have an identical Total Fertility Rate (TFR) of 2.1 children per woman. The TFR represents the average number of children a woman would have over her lifetime if she experienced the current age-specific fertility rates. For this model, this TFR is applied to the female population within the single reproductive cohort.\n\nThe initial population distributions (at time $t=0$) for the two countries are given below, both with a total population of 100 million people but different age structures.\n-   **Country A**: 60 million (0-24), 30 million (25-49), 10 million (50-74). This reflects a history of high fertility followed by a recent, rapid decline.\n-   **Country B**: 35 million (0-24), 35 million (25-49), 30 million (50-74).
