{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Molecular ecology often begins with quantifying the raw material of evolution: genetic variation. Before we can ask complex questions about adaptation or population history, we must first master the fundamental skill of describing a population's genetic makeup. This exercise provides a direct, hands-on opportunity to calculate allele frequencies from genotype counts, a foundational calculation for nearly all studies in population genetics [@problem_id:1865179].", "problem": "Conservation biologists are monitoring a small, isolated population of an endangered species of diploid salamander to assess its genetic diversity. They focus on a single gene locus that influences tail coloration. The gene has two alleles: a dominant allele *G* and a recessive allele *g*. By collecting tissue samples from every individual in the population and performing genetic analysis, they determined the genotypes of all 50 salamanders. The survey revealed that 10 individuals are homozygous dominant (GG), 15 are heterozygous (Gg), and 25 are homozygous recessive (gg).\n\nBased on this complete population census, calculate the frequency of the recessive allele *g*. Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "Let $N$ be the total number of diploid individuals and $n_{GG}$, $n_{Gg}$, $n_{gg}$ be the genotype counts. Each individual contributes $2$ alleles, so the total number of alleles is $2N$. The number of recessive alleles $g$ is given by $2n_{gg}+n_{Gg}$, since $gg$ contributes two $g$ alleles per individual and $Gg$ contributes one.\n\nGiven $N=50$, $n_{GG}=10$, $n_{Gg}=15$, and $n_{gg}=25$, the frequency $q$ of allele $g$ is\n$$\nq=\\frac{2n_{gg}+n_{Gg}}{2N}=\\frac{2\\cdot 25+15}{2\\cdot 50}=\\frac{65}{100}=0.65.\n$$\nThus, the recessive allele frequency is $0.65$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.65}$$", "id": "1865179"}, {"introduction": "The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a cornerstone technique in molecular ecology, allowing us to amplify minute amounts of DNA for analysis. However, its remarkable sensitivity makes it vulnerable to contamination, which can lead to false conclusions. This scenario challenges you to interpret a common but critical experimental outcome—a positive signal in a negative control—and underscores why rigorous experimental design and validation are paramount to generating trustworthy scientific data [@problem_id:1865171].", "problem": "A molecular ecologist is investigating the diet of a rare owl species by analyzing fecal pellets collected from its habitat. The goal is to determine if the owls are preying on a specific species of vole. The ecologist extracts DNA from the fecal pellets and uses a technique called Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to amplify a short, species-specific DNA sequence from the vole.\n\nTo ensure the validity of the results, several controls are included. One crucial control is the \"no-template\" negative control, which contains all the PCR reagents (water, primers, DNA polymerase, etc.) but no DNA extract from any sample. After amplification, the PCR products are visualized using gel electrophoresis, which separates DNA fragments by size.\n\nUpon examining the gel, the ecologist observes that the lanes corresponding to several fecal samples show a distinct DNA band at 450 base pairs, which is the expected size for the vole-specific DNA sequence. However, the lane for the no-template negative control also shows a clear band at the same 450 base pair size.\n\nWhich of the following is the most likely and scientifically sound interpretation of this specific observation in the negative control lane?\n\nA. The results are invalid because one or more of the PCR reagents were contaminated with vole DNA.\n\nB. The PCR primers are binding to each other and creating a product of 450 base pairs.\n\nC. The experiment was highly successful, demonstrating that the PCR is sensitive enough to detect even trace amounts of DNA.\n\nD. The owl species has endogenous DNA sequences that are similar enough to the vole-specific sequence to be amplified.\n\nE. The gel electrophoresis was run at an incorrect voltage, causing DNA from an adjacent lane to leak into the negative control lane.", "solution": "PCR detects specific DNA sequences by primer-directed amplification using DNA polymerase. A no-template negative control contains all reagents except any DNA extract; therefore, the only scientifically valid expectation for this control is no amplification, resulting in no band on the gel.\n\nObservation: A clear band at the expected target size of 450 base pairs appears in the no-template control. In a no-template reaction, the only way to generate a specific-sized amplicon is the presence of unintended template DNA carrying the target sequence (commonly aerosolized carryover amplicon from previous PCRs or contaminated reagents/primers). Thus, the most likely interpretation is contamination.\n\nWhy the other options are not consistent:\n- Primer-dimer artifacts (option B) typically produce much smaller products, often less than 100 base pairs, and do not reproducibly form a clean, specific band matching the exact expected target size of 450 base pairs.\n- High sensitivity (option C) does not explain amplification in the complete absence of intended template; sensitivity does not justify a positive signal in a negative control and instead points to contamination.\n- Endogenous owl sequences (option D) cannot explain a band in the no-template control because no DNA was added to that reaction.\n- Incorrect gel voltage (option E) can distort migration but does not create bands in an empty lane. Physical spillover from adjacent wells is a loading error, not a voltage issue, and would not reliably produce a sharp, target-sized band.\n\nTherefore, the most scientifically sound interpretation is contamination of one or more PCR components with target DNA or its amplicon, rendering the results invalid until the contamination source is eliminated.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1865171"}, {"introduction": "Modern molecular ecology leverages whole-genome data to unravel the evolutionary forces shaping populations. Different processes, such as natural selection or demographic history, can sometimes leave similar footprints in the genome, creating a significant analytical challenge. This advanced problem requires you to think like a population geneticist and devise a strategy to distinguish a selective sweep from a population bottleneck, forcing a deeper consideration of how different evolutionary statistics, when used in concert, can resolve complex questions about adaptation [@problem_id:1865164].", "problem": "A team of ecologists is studying a plant species, *Silene metallica*, that has colonized the tailings of an old copper mine. This \"tolerant\" population thrives in soil with high heavy metal concentrations, while an adjacent \"non-tolerant\" population of the same species on uncontaminated soil cannot survive on the mine tailings. Whole-genome sequencing reveals a striking pattern: a 150 kilobase (kb) region on chromosome 3 in the tolerant population exhibits extremely low nucleotide diversity ($\\pi$, a measure of local genetic variation) and a very high Fixation Index ($F_{ST}$, a measure of genetic differentiation) when compared to the non-tolerant population.\n\nTwo primary hypotheses are proposed to explain this genomic signature:\n\n1.  **Hard Selective Sweep:** A single, new beneficial mutation conferring heavy metal tolerance arose in this region and rapidly swept to high frequency, carrying linked neutral DNA with it and thus purging genetic variation locally.\n2.  **Localized Bottleneck Effect:** The tolerant population was founded by a very small number of individuals who, purely by chance (i.e., through genetic drift), happened to carry similar haplotypes for this specific 150 kb region, while retaining more variation elsewhere in the genome. Such a scenario is sometimes referred to as \"surfing\" on the wave of a spatial expansion.\n\nYour task is to identify the most robust and powerful follow-up analysis strategy that could most effectively distinguish between these two hypotheses. In your evaluation, consider that a population bottleneck followed by rapid population growth can produce a Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS) skewed towards rare alleles, a signature also characteristic of a selective sweep. Assume you have access to the complete genome sequences for many individuals from both the tolerant and non-tolerant populations.\n\nWhich of the following research strategies offers the most definitive approach to differentiate a hard selective sweep from a localized bottleneck effect in this scenario?\n\nA. Focus exclusively on the 150 kb region and sequence a much larger sample of individuals from both populations. This will provide more accurate estimates of $\\pi$ and $F_{ST}$, which can then be used to definitively test models of selection versus drift.\n\nB. Perform a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) for the metal tolerance trait using individuals from both populations. If the most significant genetic variant associated with tolerance is located within the 150 kb region, this would conclusively prove the selective sweep hypothesis.\n\nC. Calculate Tajima's D, a statistic that summarizes the Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS), for the 150 kb region in the tolerant population. A significantly negative Tajima's D indicates an excess of rare alleles, which is a unique and unambiguous signature of a hard selective sweep.\n\nD. Compute and compare population genetic statistics from the 150 kb region against the background of the entire genome. Specifically, analyze if the observed reduction in nucleotide diversity ($\\pi$), the pattern of Linkage Disequilibrium (LD), and the skew in the SFS are uniquely pronounced in the focal region or if similar, albeit less extreme, patterns are present genome-wide.\n\nE. Sequence the homologous 150 kb region in several other geographically distant, non-tolerant populations of *Silene metallica*. If these populations also show moderately low diversity in this region, it suggests a pre-existing low-diversity state, favoring the bottleneck hypothesis where founders were drawn from such a population.", "solution": "We want to choose the approach that most powerfully distinguishes a local hard selective sweep from a demographic founder effect localized by chance. A hard selective sweep leaves a spatially localized footprint tied to recombination around the selected site: a pronounced trough in nucleotide diversity $\\pi$ centered on the target that decays with distance, an extended haplotype of unusually high homozygosity and strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) near the selected site that relaxes with distance according to the local recombination rate, and a distinctive skew in the site frequency spectrum (SFS), including an excess of high-frequency derived variants (detectable with statistics such as Fay and Wu’s $H$) in addition to an excess of rare variants. In contrast, a demographic bottleneck and expansion primarily impose genome-wide patterns: reduced $\\pi$ genome-wide, globally elevated LD, and a genome-wide SFS skew towards rare alleles. Even if a small founder group happens by chance to carry similar haplotypes in a particular region, it will not create the canonical, recombination-anchored decay of diversity and haplotype homozygosity centered on a specific locus, nor will it produce a uniquely extreme outlier relative to the genome-wide null once the demographic history has been accounted for.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n\nOption A proposes only increasing sample size and re-estimating $\\pi$ and $F_{ST}$ in the focal region. Low $\\pi$ and high $F_{ST}$ are consistent with both selective sweeps and demographic events, so more precise estimates of these two summaries alone cannot definitively distinguish selection from drift. Without contrasting these statistics against genome-wide distributions under an inferred demographic model, this is not decisive.\n\nOption B proposes a GWAS across the two populations. While a GWAS may localize the trait to the 150 kb region, population stratification can induce spurious associations, and a true association does not distinguish whether the local reduction in diversity and LD patterns result from a recent hard sweep versus drift in founders carrying a pre-existing causative allele. GWAS addresses genetic architecture of the trait but not the evolutionary process that produced the regional genomic signature.\n\nOption C proposes using Tajima’s $D$. The statistic is $D=\\frac{\\hat{\\theta}_{\\pi}-\\hat{\\theta}_{W}}{\\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}_{\\pi}-\\hat{\\theta}_{W})}}$, where $\\hat{\\theta}_{\\pi}$ is based on average pairwise differences and $\\hat{\\theta}_{W}$ is Watterson’s estimator from the number of segregating sites. A significantly negative $D$ indicates an excess of rare alleles. However, both recent selective sweeps and bottleneck-then-expansion histories generate negative $D$, so this signature is not unique to sweeps and is not decisive without a genome-wide demographic control.\n\nOption D explicitly uses the entire genome as a control to build a demographic null and then asks whether the focal region is an extreme outlier in multiple, complementary summaries: $\\pi$, LD patterns (for example, long-range extended haplotype homozygosity and its decay with recombination distance), and the SFS (including Tajima’s $D$ and Fay and Wu’s $H$), as well as cross-population haplotype-based tests (e.g., XP-EHH, XP-CLR) and sweep-detection composite likelihoods calibrated on the inferred demographic history. Under a hard sweep, one expects a uniquely strong, localized reduction in diversity and elevated, long-range haplotype homozygosity centered on the selected site with a decay tied to the recombination map, and a skew in the SFS that is more extreme than genome-wide patterns attributable to demography. Under a bottleneck, similar skews and elevated LD appear genome-wide, and the focal region would not stand out as a unique outlier once demographic history is accounted for. Thus, contrasting the focal region to the genome-wide background while modeling demography provides a robust, powerful, and widely accepted framework to discriminate selection from drift.\n\nOption E surveys the same region in other non-tolerant populations. Modestly low diversity elsewhere could reflect background selection, low recombination, or conserved constraint and does not by itself distinguish a recent hard sweep in the tolerant population from demographic explanations. It is informative but not definitive.\n\nBecause only a genome-wide, demography-aware contrast can cleanly separate locus-specific selection from genome-wide demographic effects, the most definitive strategy among the choices is to compute and compare the focal region’s statistics against the full-genome background (Option D), ideally accompanied by explicit demographic inference and selection scans calibrated to that demographic model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1865164"}]}
