The Leaf Economic Spectrum (LES) is a prime example, contrasting fast-growing, 'resource-acquisitive' species with slow-growing, 'resource-conservative' ones. This practice challenges you to quantify a species' position on this spectrum by calculating an index from key leaf traits, helping you understand how multiple traits combine to define an organism's ecological strategy [@problem_id:1893334].", "problem": "An ecologist is studying plant functional strategies using the framework of the Leaf Economic Spectrum (LES). The LES describes a universal trade-off in plant leaf traits, ranging from \"resource-acquisitive\" species (which grow fast but are less durable) to \"resource-conservative\" species (which grow slowly but are more robust). Two key traits on this spectrum are the Specific Leaf Area (SLA), defined as the leaf area per unit of dry leaf mass, and the mass-based Leaf Nitrogen Content (LNC). Acquisitive species typically exhibit high SLA and high LNC.\n\nTo compare the strategies of four candidate tree species for a restoration project, the ecologist measures their average leaf traits. To create a single metric, she defines a \"Relative Acquisitiveness Index\" (RAI). The RAI for any given species is calculated as the product of its normalized SLA and its normalized LNC. The normalization for each trait is performed by dividing the species' trait value by the maximum value observed for that trait across all four candidate species. The RAI is a dimensionless quantity.\n\nThe collected data are as follows:\n- **Species A:** SLA = 28.0 m²/kg; LNC = 2.10 g/100g\n- **Species B:** SLA = 15.0 m²/kg; LNC = 1.20 g/100g\n- **Species C:** SLA = 9.5 m²/kg; LNC = 0.80 g/100g\n- **Species D:** SLA = 21.5 m²/kg; LNC = 1.80 g/100g\n\nBased on this dataset and the definition provided, calculate the Relative Acquisitiveness Index (RAI) for Species B.

Ecological stoichiometry examines the balance of chemical elements in ecological interactions, and an organism's ability to maintain its internal elemental balance (homeostasis) is a critical functional trait.

A prevailing hypothesis suggests a trade-off between strict homeostasis and life-history traits like growth and survival.\n\nConsider a controlled laboratory experiment designed to investigate this trade-off in two hypothetical species of terrestrial isopods, Species A and Species B, which are both detritivores. Species A is known to be a \"stoichiometrically flexible\" consumer, meaning its body's carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio tends to shift towards the C:N ratio of its diet. In contrast, Species B is \"stoichiometrically rigid,\" maintaining a nearly constant body C:N ratio regardless of its food source.\n\nIn the experiment, two separate populations, one for each species, are established. Each population begins with 100 individuals. All individuals of both species have an initial average body mass ($m_0$) of 10.0 mg. Both populations are fed exclusively on a low-quality diet of dried oak leaf litter, which has a high C:N mass ratio. The experiment is run for a duration ($t$) of 30 days.\n\nAt the end of the 30-day period, the following data were collected for each species:\n- **For Species A:** 60 individuals survived. The average final mass ($m_f$) of these survivors was 15.0 mg.\n- **For Species B:** 90 individuals survived. The average final mass ($m_f$) of these survivors was 12.5 mg.\n\nTo quantify the performance trade-off between the two species on this challenging diet, we define a \"Growth-Survival Trade-off Index,\" $T$, as:\n$$T = \\frac{g_A \\cdot s_B}{g_B \\cdot s_A}$$\nwhere $s_A$ and $s_B$ are the survival fractions (number of survivors / initial number) for Species A and B, respectively. The terms $g_A$ and $g_B$ represent the specific growth rates for each species, calculated using the standard formula:\n$$g = \\frac{\\ln(m_f) - \\ln(m_0)}{t}$$\nwhere $\\ln$ is the natural logarithm.\n\nBased on the experimental data provided, calculate the numerical value of the Growth-Survival Trade-off Index, $T$.
