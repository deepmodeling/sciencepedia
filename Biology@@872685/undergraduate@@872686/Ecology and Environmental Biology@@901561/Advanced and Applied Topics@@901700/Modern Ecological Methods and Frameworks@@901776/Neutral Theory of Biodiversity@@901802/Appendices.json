Before exploring the theory's predictions, it is crucial to understand what kinds of real-world observations would challenge this core premise. This exercise [@problem_id:1866715] challenges you to think like a field ecologist and identify the strongest evidence of niche differentiation—the opposite of neutrality—from a set of ecological patterns.", "problem": "An ecologist is studying a plant community in a one-hectare plot of a stable, old-growth temperate forest to test the predictions of the Neutral Theory of Biodiversity. The central assumption of this theory is functional equivalence, which posits that, at a per capita level, all individuals of all species within the same trophic level have identical probabilities of birth, death, and migration. Community composition changes primarily due to stochastic demographic events (ecological drift) rather than deterministic differences in species' competitive abilities or environmental adaptations.\n\nThe ecologist records several observations about the distribution and abundance of the plant species in the plot. Which of the following observations, if true, would provide the strongest evidence *against* the core assumption of functional equivalence?\n\nA. The relative abundance distribution of the different plant species fits a hollow curve, where a few species are highly abundant and most species are rare.\n\nB. After a localized landslide disturbed a small section of the plot, the first species to colonize the bare ground was the one that happened to be most abundant along the undisturbed edge.\n\nC. Individuals of Species X are predominantly found growing in waterlogged, low-lying areas of the plot, while individuals of Species Y are almost exclusively found on the well-drained, elevated slopes. Both species are present in similar overall numbers in the plot.\n\nD. A map of all individuals in the plot shows that individuals of most species, especially the rarer ones, are spatially clumped rather than randomly distributed.\n\nE. Over a ten-year census period, one of the rarest species in the plot, which initially had only five individuals, went locally extinct, while a common species increased its population size.", "solution": "Under the Neutral Theory’s core assumption of functional equivalence, all species at the same trophic level have identical per capita demographic rates: for each species $i$, the per capita birth rate $b_{i}$, death rate $d_{i}$, and migration rate $m_{i}$ satisfy $b_{i}=b$, $d_{i}=d$, and $m_{i}=m$, independent of species identity and, in the simplest formulations, independent of microhabitat. Community patterns then emerge from stochastic demographic events (ecological drift) and dispersal limitation rather than from deterministic differences among species.\n\nEvaluate each observation against this assumption:\n\nA. A hollow-curve relative abundance distribution (few common species, many rare) is a canonical prediction of neutral models (e.g., logseries-like patterns) and also arises under various other mechanisms. Its presence is therefore not evidence against functional equivalence.\n\nB. Following a small disturbance, the first colonist being the species most abundant at the nearby edge is consistent with neutral expectations via propagule pressure: if all species have identical per capita dispersal $m$, a species with more individuals near the boundary will, by chance, contribute more dispersers and thus is more likely to colonize first. This does not require species differences.\n\nC. Strong habitat segregation, where Species X is predominantly in waterlogged lowlands and Species Y almost exclusively on well-drained slopes, implies systematic, environment-dependent performance differences. Formally, this requires habitat-specific per capita rates $b_{i,h}$, $d_{i,h}$ such that, for some habitats $h$, $b_{X,h}-d_{X,h}$ differs from $b_{Y,h}-d_{Y,h}$ in a consistent way, i.e., $b_{X,h},d_{X,h}$ are not equal to $b_{Y,h},d_{Y,h}$. Such deterministic niche differentiation (environmental filtering) violates functional equivalence.\n\nD. Spatial clumping, especially of rare species, is expected under neutral dynamics with limited dispersal, where local recruitment leads to aggregated spatial patterns. Thus clumping is not evidence against neutrality.\n\nE. The local extinction of a very rare species and increase of a common species over a decade aligns with ecological drift: small populations are more prone to stochastic extinction, while common species may stochastically increase. This pattern does not require differences in per capita rates.\n\nTherefore, the observation that most strongly contradicts the assumption that all species are functionally equivalent is the consistent, niche-based habitat segregation described in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1866715"}, {"introduction": "A central theme of neutral theory is the role of chance, or stochasticity, in shaping communities. This randomness extends to how we observe nature; our samples are just small, random draws from a much larger system.

Chance and random dispersal thus play a major role in shaping community composition.\n\nConsider a simplified, isolated metacommunity modeled under these neutral assumptions. At a particular point in time, the community consists of a total of $N$ individuals, distributed among three distinct species: a common species (Species 1), a species with intermediate abundance (Species 2), and a rare species (Species 3). The populations are $N_1$, $N_2$, and $N_3$ for Species 1, 2, and 3, respectively, such that $N = N_1 + N_2 + N_3$.\n\nAn ecologist performs a census by collecting a random sample of $n$ individuals from this metacommunity without replacement. A primary concern in such sampling is whether the sample accurately reflects the full biodiversity of the community.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the probability that the sample is \"incomplete,\" defined as the sample failing to contain at least one individual from every species present in the metacommunity (i.e., at least one of the three species is completely absent from the sample). The expression should be in terms of $N_1$, $N_2$, $N_3$, and $n$.
