The ecologist models the equilibrium number of species, $S_{eq}$, on an island using a simplified version of the MacArthur-Wilson theory of island biogeography.\n\nIn this model, the immigration rate of new species is given by $I(S) = \\frac{C}{D} \\left(1 - \\frac{S}{P}\\right)$, and the extinction rate of existing species is $E(S) = \\frac{K}{A} \\frac{S}{P}$.\n\nHere, $A$ is the area of the island, $D$ is its distance from the mainland, and $S$ is the number of species currently on the island. The model uses three constants: $P$, the total number of species in the mainland source pool; $C$, an immigration-related coefficient; and $K$, an extinction-related coefficient. The equilibrium number of species, $S_{eq}$, is achieved on an island when the immigration rate equals the extinction rate, i.e., $I(S_{eq}) = E(S_{eq})$.\n\nThe ecologist has determined the following parameters for the region:\n- Mainland species pool: $P = 300$ species\n- Immigration coefficient: $C = 1.00 \\times 10^3 \\text{ species} \\cdot \\text{km/year}$\n- Extinction coefficient: $K = 2.00 \\times 10^3 \\text{ species} \\cdot \\text{km}^2\\text{/year}$\n\nThe island characteristics are:\n- Isola Grande has an area of $A_{IG} = 600 \\text{ km}^2$ and is located $D_{IG} = 200 \\text{ km}$ from the mainland.\n- Isola Piccola has an area of $A_{IP} = 150 \\text{ km}^2$.\n\nField surveys reveal a surprising finding that is contrary to the simple expectation that larger islands support more species.
