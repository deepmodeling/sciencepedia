Instead of attempting to capture and test host amphibians, which is invasive and logistically challenging, the team plans to use environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis. This technique involves filtering water and testing for the presence of genetic material shed by the target organism. Previous studies in similar ecosystems suggest that when the fungus is present, its free-floating DNA fragments are found at a very low average concentration, which can be modeled as a stochastic process. The team assumes an average concentration of $\\lambda = 3.5$ DNA copies per cubic meter of water. To consider the wetland \"positive\" for the fungus, the team must detect at least one DNA copy. What is the minimum volume of water, in liters, they must filter to be at least 98% certain of detecting the fungus, assuming it is present?\n\nFor your calculation, you may need the conversion factor $1 \\text{ m}^3 = 1000 \\text{ L}$.

Sample A is collected from a pristine, high-altitude pond, believed to be the exclusive habitat of a rare endemic species, the Alpine Salamander. Sample B is from a lowland marsh known to be densely populated by an invasive species, the American Bullfrog, with negligible presence of other vertebrate species.\n\nTo prepare the samples for sequencing, DNA from each sample is amplified using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and tagged with a unique pair of indices (Index A for Sample A, Index B for Sample B). The two resulting libraries are then pooled together for sequencing on a platform known to be susceptible to \"index hopping\". Index hopping is an artifact where an indexing primer intended for one library fragment incorrectly attaches to a fragment from a different library during the sequencing process. Assume that for any given DNA fragment, there is a small, constant probability, $h$, that it will be mis-assigned to the *other* sample's index pool during sequencing.\n\nAfter sequencing, bioinformatics analysis yields the following results:\n1.  The pool of reads assigned to Index A (the Alpine Salamander pond) contains a total of $N_A$ = 1,120,000 reads.\n2.  Within this Index A pool, a fraction $f_{B \\to A} = 0.035$ of the reads are taxonomically identified as belonging to the American Bullfrog.\n3.  Initial quantification of the DNA libraries before pooling showed that the concentration of amplifiable Bullfrog DNA (from Sample B) was 25 times greater than that of the Alpine Salamander DNA (from Sample A).\n\nAssuming the ratio of true reads generated from each sample is directly proportional to their initial DNA concentration in the pool, calculate the total number of true Alpine Salamander reads that were incorrectly assigned to the American Bullfrog (Index B) pool due to index hopping.

This gives us the ratio of true reads:\n$$K = \\frac{T_B}{T_A} = 25$$\n\nThe number of reads observed in the Index A pool, $N_A$, is composed of two parts: the true Salamander reads that were correctly indexed, and the true Bullfrog reads that incorrectly \"hopped\" to Index A.\nThe number of correctly indexed Salamander reads is $T_A(1-h)$.\nThe number of Bullfrog reads that hopped to Index A is $T_B \\times h$.\nSo, the total observed reads for Index A is $N_A = T_A(1-h) + T_B h$.\n\nThe problem states that a fraction $f_{B \\to A} = 0.035$ of the reads in the Index A pool were identified as Bullfrog.
