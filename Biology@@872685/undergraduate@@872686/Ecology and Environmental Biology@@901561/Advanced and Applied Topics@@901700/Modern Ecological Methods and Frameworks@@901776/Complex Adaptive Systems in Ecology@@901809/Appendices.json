Using a simplified model of disease spread, we will see how a small change in a local parameter—the probability of transmission, $p$—can lead to a dramatic shift in the global behavior of the system. By approximating the critical threshold, you will gain hands-on experience with a powerful analytical tool and develop an intuition for how large-scale emergent phenomena arise from simple, local rules [@problem_id:1836602].", "problem": "An agricultural research station is studying a new fungal blight affecting a crop planted in a vast, uniform grid. The spread of the blight can be modeled using a spatial simulation on an infinite two-dimensional square lattice, where each lattice site represents a plant.\n\nThe disease spreads from an infected plant to its immediate neighbors. The set of immediate neighbors for any given plant consists of the four plants located in the adjacent northern, southern, eastern, and western positions (this is known as a von Neumann neighborhood). If a plant becomes infected, it attempts to infect each of its four susceptible neighbors. Each of these transmission attempts is an independent event that succeeds with a probability $p$. Once a plant is infected, it remains infected and continues to be a source of infection.\n\nEcologists observe a phase transition in the system's behavior. For small values of the transmission probability $p$, any outbreak started from a single infected plant remains confined to a small, finite cluster of plants. However, if $p$ exceeds a certain critical probability, $p_c$, a single infected plant can trigger a large-scale epidemic that has a non-zero chance of spreading indefinitely across the entire grid.\n\nYour task is to estimate this critical probability, $p_c$. To do this, use a simplified branching process approximation. In this model, consider the outward spread of the disease from an infection source. The key assumption is that the infection does not immediately double back; that is, a newly infected plant will spread the disease to its susceptible neighbors, but not back to the specific plant that just infected it. A large-scale epidemic is possible only if each infected plant, on average, infects at least one *new* plant.\n\nDetermine the value of this critical probability $p_c$. Express your answer as a single, irreducible fraction.", "solution": "We approximate the spread by a Galton–Watson branching process under the stated no-immediate-backtracking assumption. Each infection event to a neighbor is an independent Bernoulli trial with success probability $p$.\n\nAt the initial source (generation $0$), there are $4$ susceptible neighbors, so the number of new infections in generation $1$ is $\\mathrm{Bin}(4,p)$ with expectation\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Z_{1}]=4p.\n$$\nFor every subsequent generation, a newly infected plant has $3$ forward neighbors (excluding the one from which it was infected).

We will focus on the Allee effect, where populations below a certain density are doomed to extinction because cooperation is necessary for survival or reproduction.

The population density is denoted by $N$. Due to the necessity of cooperative hunting for acquiring sufficient resources for reproduction, the per capita birth rate is density-dependent. It can be modeled by the expression $b \\frac{N}{K_b + N}$, where $b$ is the maximum achievable per capita birth rate at very high densities and $K_b$ is the population density at which the cooperative hunting benefit yields half of this maximum birth rate.\n\nThe population faces two primary sources of mortality. First, there is a constant, density-independent per capita death rate, $d$, due to natural causes and harsh environmental conditions. Second, as the population grows, competition for territory and secondary resources introduces a density-dependent mortality component, with a per capita rate of $cN$, where $c$ is a constant representing the strength of intraspecific competition.\n\nUnder certain conditions for the parameters $b, K_b, d,$ and $c$, the population has a critical density threshold below which it will inevitably decline to extinction. This threshold is an unstable equilibrium point. Above this threshold, the population will grow towards a stable carrying capacity.\n\nAssuming the parameters are such that two distinct, positive, non-zero equilibrium densities exist, derive an expression for the critical density threshold, often called the Allee threshold.
