Ecologists are interested in predicting the equilibrium number of insect species that will eventually colonize these islands. Both islands have an identical surface area, $A = 500 \\text{ km}^2$. The primary source of colonizing insects is a large mainland continent which has a species pool of $P = 400$ distinct insect species. Isola Vicina is located at a distance $D_V = 150 \\text{ km}$ from the mainland, while Isola Lontana is much farther, at a distance $D_L = 1200 \\text{ km}$.\n\nBased on the theory of island biogeography, the colonization and extinction dynamics are modeled as follows:\nThe rate of immigration of new species, $I$, for an island with $S$ species already present is given by the linear model $I(S) = I_{max} \\left(1 - \\frac{S}{P}\\right)$. The maximum immigration rate, $I_{max}$, which occurs when the island is empty ($S=0$), is inversely proportional to the distance from the mainland, $D$, such that $I_{max} = \\frac{\\mathcal{I}}{D}$.\nThe rate of extinction of species, $E$, is given by $E(S) = E_{max} \\left(\\frac{S}{P}\\right)$.
