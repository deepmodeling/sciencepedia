This phenomenon is a classic example of resource partitioning. We can model their foraging success using principles from optimal foraging theory.\n\nThe net rate of energy gain, $R(L)$, for a predator is defined as the net energy obtained from a prey item divided by the handling time, $R(L) = (E(L) - C(L)) / T(L)$. Here, $L$ is a characteristic dimension of the prey, which we take to be the bivalve's shell length in centimeters. $E(L)$ is the total energy content of the bivalve, $C(L)$ is the energetic cost of predation (capturing, handling, and consuming), and $T(L)$ is the handling time.\n\nThe energy content of a bivalve is proportional to its biomass, which scales with its volume. Thus, we model the energy content as $E(L) = \\alpha L^3$.\n\nFor the Crusher Crab, both the energetic cost and the time required to break the shell increase rapidly with its size and thickness. The cost and handling time are modeled as:\n- Cost: $C_{crab}(L) = \\beta L^4$\n- Handling Time: $T_{crab}(L) = \\gamma L^2$\n\nFor the Driller Snail, which uses a radula to drill a hole through the shell, the cost and handling time are primarily dependent on the shell thickness, which scales linearly with length:\n- Cost: $C_{snail}(L) = \\delta L$\n- Handling Time: $T_{snail}(L) = \\epsilon L$\n\nThe parameters for these models have been empirically determined as follows:\n- $\\alpha = 20.0 \\text{ J/cm}^3$\n- $\\beta = 5.00 \\text{ J/cm}^4$\n- $\\gamma = 10.0 \\text{ s/cm}^2$\n- $\\delta = 36.0 \\text{ J/cm}$\n- $\\epsilon = 4.00 \\text{ s/cm}$\n\nResource partitioning theory predicts that the boundary between the preferred prey sizes for each predator occurs where their net rates of energy gain are equal.
