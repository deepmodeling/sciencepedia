The ecologist samples the population and records the number of individuals found utilizing five different host plant species. The niche breadth, a measure of the variety of resources a species uses, can be quantified using Levins' index, $B$, given by the formula:\n$$B = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^{R} p_i^2}$$\nwhere $R$ is the total number of resource categories (in this case, host plant species) and $p_i$ is the proportion of individuals of the species found utilizing resource category $i$.\n\nInitially, the ecologist collects the following data for what is assumed to be the single species *Phalaena ficta*:\n- Host Plant 1: 250 individuals\n- Host Plant 2: 250 individuals\n- Host Plant 3: 200 individuals\n- Host Plant 4: 150 individuals\n- Host Plant 5: 150 individuals\n\nSubsequent genetic analysis reveals a surprising discovery: *P. ficta* is not a single species but is composed of two morphologically identical cryptic species, Species A and Species B, which are reproductively isolated. The ecologist re-analyzes the original samples using genetic markers and is able to assign each individual to its correct species. The new breakdown of host plant utilization for each specialist species is as follows:\n\n**Species A:**\n- Host Plant 1: 200 individuals\n- Host Plant 2: 200 individuals\n- Host Plant 3: 50 individuals\n- Host Plant 4: 25 individuals\n- Host Plant 5: 25 individuals\n\n**Species B:**\n- Host Plant 1: 50 individuals\n- Host Plant 2: 50 individuals\n- Host Plant 3: 150 individuals\n- Host Plant 4: 125 individuals\n- Host Plant 5: 125 individuals\n\nYour task is to quantify the change in the ecological assessment of niche structure due to this discovery.

The outcome of their competition can be predicted using Tilman's resource-ratio theory. The key parameters for each species $j$ are its break-even resource concentrations ($R^*_{Si,j}$ and $R^*_{N,j}$), below which net growth is negative, and its per-biomass resource consumption constants ($c_{Si,j}$ and $c_{N,j}$). A species can achieve positive net growth only when the ambient concentrations of both silicate and nitrate are above their respective $R^*$ values.\n\nThe parameters for the two species are as follows:\n\nFor *Thalassiosira competitora* (Species A):\n-   $R^*_{Si,A} = 1.2$ micromoles/liter\n-   $R^*_{N,A} = 5.0$ micromoles/liter\n-   $c_{Si,A} = 0.08$ micromoles of Si per mg of biomass\n-   $c_{N,A} = 0.50$ micromoles of N per mg of biomass\n\nFor *Asterionella ecologica* (Species B):\n-   $R^*_{Si,B} = 3.5$ micromoles/liter\n-   $R^*_{N,B} = 1.8$ micromoles/liter\n-   $c_{Si,B} = 0.30$ micromoles of Si per mg of biomass\n-   $c_{N,B} = 0.20$ micromoles of N per mg of biomass\n\nThese species inhabit a region with a strong environmental gradient, causing the supply ratio of silicate to nitrate to vary significantly.

The outcome of competition between two species for two limiting resources is determined by their respective break-even resource concentrations ($R^*$) and their resource consumption vectors.\n\nFirst, we must determine the competitive abilities of each species for each resource. A species is a superior competitor for a resource if it has a lower $R^*$ value for that resource, meaning it can sustain its population at a lower ambient concentration.\n-   For silicate (Si): $R^*_{Si,A} = 1.2 \\, \\mu\\text{M}$ and $R^*_{Si,B} = 3.5 \\, \\mu\\text{M}$.

The ZNGI for a species is an L-shaped line in the resource plane (e.g., $R_{Si}$ vs. $R_N$), with the corner at $(R^*_{Si}, R^*_{N})$. A stable coexistence equilibrium can occur at the intersection of the two ZNGIs, where each species' growth is limited by the resource for which it is the poorer competitor. This equilibrium point, E, has coordinates $(R_{Si}, R_N) = (R^*_{Si,B}, R^*_{N,A})$.\n-   At this point, Species A is limited by nitrate ($R_N = R^*_{N,A}$).\n-   At this point, Species B is limited by silicate ($R_{Si} = R^*_{Si,B}$).\n\nCoexistence is stable if the resource supply point, $(S_{Si}, S_N)$, lies within a specific \"coexistence cone\" a region in the supply space.

Let's analyze the regions outside this range:\n-   If $\\frac{S_{Si}}{S_N} < 0.16$, the supply of silicate is very low relative to nitrate. In this scenario, competition is primarily for silicate.
