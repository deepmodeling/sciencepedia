{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A classic method for distinguishing between a species' fundamental and realized niche is the transplant experiment. By moving a species to a new environment and manipulating the presence of competitors, ecologists can determine whether its absence is due to physiological intolerance of the abiotic conditions or exclusion by other species. This exercise challenges you to interpret the results of a quintessential transplant study, a cornerstone of experimental ecology, to deduce the primary factor limiting a plant's distribution [@problem_id:1850555].", "problem": "An ecologist is studying *Calystegia collina*, a plant species that, in nature, is found exclusively on serpentine soils. Serpentine soils are characterized by low levels of essential nutrients (like nitrogen and calcium) and high concentrations of toxic heavy metals (like magnesium, nickel, and chromium). The ecologist wants to determine why this species is restricted to this challenging environment. The **fundamental niche** is the full range of environmental conditions and resources a species can use to survive and reproduce, based on its physiological limits and in the absence of adverse biotic interactions (like competition and predation). The **realized niche** is the portion of the fundamental niche that the species actually occupies when such interactions are present.\n\nTo investigate this, the ecologist conducts a transplant experiment. Seeds of *C. collina* are planted into three types of experimental plots:\n1.  **Plot S (Serpentine Control):** An area of typical serpentine soil.\n2.  **Plot N-C (Non-serpentine with Competitors):** An area of nearby fertile, non-serpentine soil with its natural vegetation left intact.\n3.  **Plot N+C (Non-serpentine Cleared):** An area of the same fertile, non-serpentine soil, but with all existing vegetation carefully removed before planting.\n\nAfter one growing season, the ecologist measures the survival and average biomass of the *C. collina* seedlings in each plot. The results are as follows:\n-   In Plot S, the seedlings survived and grew to a modest size.\n-   In Plot N-C, none of the seedlings survived.\n-   In Plot N+C, the seedlings not only survived but grew much larger and more vigorously than in Plot S.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following is the most accurate conclusion?\n\nA. The fundamental niche of *Calystegia collina* is identical to its realized niche.\n\nB. *Calystegia collina* is physiologically restricted to serpentine soils due to its unique metabolic requirements.\n\nC. The distribution of *Calystegia collina* is limited primarily by the abiotic factors of non-serpentine soils.\n\nD. The realized niche of *Calystegia collina* is smaller than its fundamental niche due to interspecific competition.\n\nE. *Calystegia collina* is a superior competitor in non-serpentine soils but an inferior competitor in serpentine soils.", "solution": "Define terms: The fundamental niche is the set of environmental conditions and resources where a species can survive and reproduce in the absence of negative biotic interactions (like competition). The realized niche is the subset of the fundamental niche that is actually occupied in nature when accounting for these biotic interactions.\n\nInterpret the experimental outcomes relative to abiotic versus biotic limits.\n1. In Plot S (serpentine control), seedlings survived and attained modest size. This establishes that serpentine soils are within the species’ fundamental niche, though the modest growth suggests stressful abiotic conditions.\n2. In Plot N+C (non-serpentine, cleared of vegetation), seedlings survived and grew much larger and more vigorously than in Plot S. Because all other vegetation was removed, this treatment isolates abiotic conditions of non-serpentine soils. The strong performance demonstrates that the abiotic environment of non-serpentine soils is not limiting; rather, it supports better growth. Therefore, non-serpentine abiotic conditions lie within, and even favor, the species’ fundamental niche. This directly contradicts any claim of a physiological restriction to serpentine soils.\n3. In Plot N-C (non-serpentine with competitors), none of the seedlings survived. The key difference from Plot N+C is the presence of the resident plant community. Since abiotic conditions are the same as in Plot N+C where seedlings thrived, the failure here must be attributed to biotic interactions, most parsimoniously interspecific competition from the established vegetation, which prevents establishment and survival.\n\nSynthesis: The species can grow and reproduce on non-serpentine soils under benign abiotic conditions when competitors are absent, so the fundamental niche includes non-serpentine soils. However, in nature, non-serpentine habitats contain competitors that exclude the species, so the realized niche is restricted to serpentine habitats where competitors are fewer or weaker due to harsh abiotic stress. Thus, the realized niche is smaller than the fundamental niche due to interspecific competition.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is false because the experiment shows the fundamental niche is broader than the realized niche.\n- B is false because performance on cleared non-serpentine soils indicates no physiological restriction to serpentine.\n- C is false because abiotic factors on non-serpentine are not limiting; they enhance growth.\n- D is correct: the realized niche is smaller than the fundamental niche due to interspecific competition.\n- E is false: the species is not a superior competitor on non-serpentine (it fails when competitors are present); its success on serpentine is due to tolerance of abiotic stress that limits competitors, not superior competitive ability there.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1850555"}, {"introduction": "In nature, a species' realized niche is often shaped by a complex web of interactions, not just a single competitor. This problem builds upon the concept of biotic limitation by presenting a more realistic scenario where a species is simultaneously squeezed by different pressures at opposite ends of its fundamental range. Your task is to synthesize the effects of predation and interspecific competition along a temperature gradient to accurately describe the boundaries of the Shaded Darter's realized niche [@problem_id:1850590].", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the distribution of two fish species, the Shaded Darter and the Sunfin Minnow, along a stable longitudinal temperature gradient in a river. The Shaded Darter can physiologically tolerate a temperature range of $10^\\circ\\text{C}$ to $22^\\circ\\text{C}$. The Sunfin Minnow can tolerate a range of $16^\\circ\\text{C}$ to $28^\\circ\\text{C}$. In laboratory settings where they are kept in separate tanks, both species thrive throughout their respective tolerable temperature ranges.\n\nHowever, field observations reveal a more complex distribution. A predatory bird, the River Kingfisher, forages heavily in the cooler, clearer upstream waters where temperatures range from $10^\\circ\\text{C}$ to $15^\\circ\\text{C}$, but it rarely hunts in the warmer, more turbid downstream sections. Furthermore, in the zone of thermal overlap ($16^\\circ\\text{C}$ to $22^\\circ\\text{C}$), the Sunfin Minnow is a much more aggressive and efficient forager, and it consistently outcompetes the Shaded Darter for resources.\n\nBased on these interactions, which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between the fundamental thermal niche and the realized thermal niche of the Shaded Darter in this river system?\n\nA. The realized niche is identical to the fundamental niche.\n\nB. The realized niche is a subset of the fundamental niche, restricted solely by predation from the River Kingfisher.\n\nC.

The realized niche is a subset of the fundamental niche, restricted solely by interspecific competition from the Sunfin Minnow.\n\nE. The realized niche is larger than the fundamental niche due to the combined effects of competition and predation.\n\nF. The fundamental and realized niches are both determined exclusively by the abiotic temperature gradient, with biotic interactions being negligible.", "solution": "We begin by distinguishing the fundamental thermal niche from the realized thermal niche. The fundamental thermal niche of the Shaded Darter is defined by the abiotic temperature range it can physiologically tolerate in the absence of biotic interactions. From the laboratory evidence, the Shaded Darter thrives across the range from $10^\\circ\\text{C}$ to $22^\\circ\\text{C}$. Thus, its fundamental thermal niche is this range.\n\nNext, we incorporate the biotic interactions that determine the realized niche in the field:\n- Predation: The River Kingfisher forages heavily in the cooler upstream waters where temperatures are from $10^\\circ\\text{C}$ to $15^\\circ\\text{C}$. This predation pressure restricts the Shaded Darter at the cooler end of its fundamental range. Therefore, the cooler portion of the fundamental niche is reduced or rendered unsuitable due to predation.\n- Interspecific competition: In the overlap zone from $16^\\circ\\text{C}$ to $22^\\circ\\text{C}$, the Sunfin Minnow is more aggressive and efficient, consistently outcompeting the Shaded Darter. This restricts the Shaded Darter at the warmer end of its fundamental range, effectively excluding it from this zone due to competition.\n\nCombining these interactions, the realized thermal niche is strictly a subset of the fundamental thermal niche, with the cooler end constrained by predation and the warmer end constrained by interspecific competition. It is not identical to the fundamental niche, not larger than it, and not restricted solely by a single biotic factor.\n\nTherefore, the statement that best captures this relationship is that the realized niche is a subset of the fundamental niche, restricted by interspecific competition at the warmer end and by predation at the cooler end.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1850590"}, {"introduction": "Ecological concepts can be powerfully described and predicted using mathematical models. This practice moves from conceptual understanding to quantitative analysis by modeling a species' niche as an energetic function. By representing the fundamental niche as an energy gain curve and competition as a cost, we can use calculus to predict precisely how a species will shift its optimal foraging behavior in response to a new competitor, thus defining the peak of its realized niche [@problem_id:1850597].", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the foraging behavior of a bird species, the Crimson-capped Finch, in a montane forest. In the absence of competitors, the finch's foraging strategy can be modeled by its fundamental niche. The net energy gain rate, $G_F(h)$, for foraging at a vertical height $h$ above the ground is well-described by a parabolic function:\n$$G_F(h) = G_{max} - \\alpha (h - h_0)^2$$\nHere, $h_0$ is the intrinsically optimal foraging height, $G_{max}$ is the maximum possible energy gain rate at this height, and $\\alpha$ is a positive constant that characterizes the bird's degree of specialization (a higher $\\alpha$ means a narrower niche).\n\nA new, invasive species of insectivorous lizard arrives in the forest. This lizard forages on the same insects as the finch but is restricted to the lower strata of the forest. This introduces interspecific competition, which imposes an energetic cost on the finch when it forages at lower heights. This competition cost, $C(h)$, decreases linearly with height and is modeled as:\n$$C(h) = C_{max} - \\beta h$$\nwhere $C_{max}$ is the maximum competition cost at ground level ($h=0$), and $\\beta$ is a positive constant representing how quickly the competitive pressure eases with increasing height. This cost function is valid for heights where $C(h) \\geq 0$.\n\nThe finch, being an optimal forager, will adjust its behavior to maximize its new net energy gain rate, which defines its realized niche. The realized niche is described by the function $G_R(h) = G_F(h) - C(h)$.\n\nDetermine the finch's new optimal foraging height, $h_{opt}$, which is the height that maximizes the net energy gain function $G_R(h)$. Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of the parameters $h_0$, $\\alpha$, and $\\beta$.", "solution": "The realized net energy gain is\n$$G_{R}(h)=G_{F}(h)-C(h)=\\left[G_{max}-\\alpha(h-h_{0})^{2}\\right]-\\left[C_{max}-\\beta h\\right]=(G_{max}-C_{max})-\\alpha(h-h_{0})^{2}+\\beta h.$$\nSince additive constants do not affect the maximizer, we maximize\n$$f(h)=-\\alpha(h-h_{0})^{2}+\\beta h.$$\nTake the derivative with respect to $h$ and set it to zero to find critical points:\n$$\\frac{df}{dh}=-2\\alpha(h-h_{0})+\\beta=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad h=h_{0}+\\frac{\\beta}{2\\alpha}.$$\nThe second derivative is\n$$\\frac{d^{2}f}{dh^{2}}=-2\\alpha<0,$$\nbecause $\\alpha>0$, so the critical point is a unique global maximum for the quadratic.
