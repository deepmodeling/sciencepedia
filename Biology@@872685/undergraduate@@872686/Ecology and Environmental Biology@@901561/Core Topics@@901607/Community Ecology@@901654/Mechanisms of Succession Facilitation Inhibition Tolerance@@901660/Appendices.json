The ecologist hypothesizes that early colonizing plants might be engaging in atmospheric nitrogen fixation, a key process of facilitation. To test this, tissue samples are collected from two plant species: a pioneer species, *Vulkania primus*, and a late-successional species, *Successio tarda*, which is known to be incapable of nitrogen fixation.\n\nThe stable nitrogen isotope composition of these samples is analyzed and expressed as a $\\delta^{15}\\text{N}$ value in parts per thousand (‰). The $\\delta^{15}\\text{N}$ value of atmospheric nitrogen ($N_2$) is defined as 0‰.

The colonization of this patch is driven by the stochastic arrival of propagules (e.g., seeds, spores) from a regional species pool.

The species of the arriving colonist is drawn randomly and independently from the set $\\{S_F, S_I, S_C\\}$, with each species having an equal probability of arrival at any step. The ecological succession of the patch is governed by the following strict rules of interaction:\n\n1.  **From an 'Empty' patch:**\n    *   If $S_F$ arrives, it colonizes successfully. The patch state becomes 'Facilitated-Immature'.\n    *   If $S_I$ arrives, it colonizes successfully. The patch state becomes 'Inhibited'.\n    *   If $S_C$ arrives, it cannot establish on the unmodified ground and fails to colonize.
