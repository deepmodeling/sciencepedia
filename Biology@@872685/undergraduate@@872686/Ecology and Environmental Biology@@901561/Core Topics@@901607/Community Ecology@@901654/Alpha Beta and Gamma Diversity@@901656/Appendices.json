It presents a standard exercise in quantitative ecology. We shall proceed with the derivation from first principles.\n\nThe analysis concerns $3$ local communities, designated by the sets of species they contain: $A=\\{1,2,3\\}$, $B=\\{2,3,4\\}$, and $C=\\{3,4,5\\}$. The species are identified by integer labels.\n\nThe first quantity to be determined is the local species richness for each community, which is the alpha diversity, denoted as $\\alpha$. The richness of a set is its cardinality, which is the count of its distinct elements.\nFor community $A$, the species richness is $\\alpha_{A} = |A| = |\\{1,2,3\\}| = 3$.\nFor community $B$, the species richness is $\\alpha_{B} = |B| = |\\{2,3,4\\}| = 3$.\nFor community $C$, the species richness is $\\alpha_{C} = |C| = |\\{3,4,5\\}| = 3$.\n\nThe next quantity required is the mean local richness, denoted as $\\bar{\\alpha}$. This is defined as the arithmetic mean of the individual local richness values. For a system of $N$ communities, it is given by $\\bar{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_i$.\nIn this case, $N=3$, so we have:\n$$ \\bar{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\alpha_{A} + \\alpha_{B} + \\alpha_{C}}{3} = \\frac{3 + 3 + 3}{3} = \\frac{9}{3} = 3 $$\nThus, the mean local richness is $\\bar{\\alpha} = 3$.\n\nThe third quantity is the regional richness, or gamma diversity, denoted as $\\gamma$. It is defined as the total number of species in the regional pool. The regional pool is the union of all local species sets.\nLet the regional species set be $R = A \\cup B \\cup C$.\n$$ R = \\{1,2,3\\} \\cup \\{2,3,4\\} \\cup \\{3,4,5\\} $$\nThe union of these sets contains all unique elements present across all sets:\n$$ R = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\} $$\nThe regional richness $\\gamma$ is the cardinality of this regional set:\n$$ \\gamma = |R| = |\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}| = 5 $$\nThus, the regional richness is $\\gamma = 5$.\n\nFinally, we must compute the Whittaker multiplicative beta diversity, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{W}}$. The problem statement provides its definition: it is the multiplicative factor by which regional richness exceeds mean local richness. This relationship is formally expressed as $\\gamma = \\bar{\\alpha} \\times \\beta_{\\mathrm{W}}$.\nTo find $\\beta_{\\mathrm{W}}$, we rearrange this fundamental equation:\n$$ \\beta_{\\mathrm{W}} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\bar{\\alpha}} $$\nSubstituting the computed values for $\\gamma$ and $\\bar{\\alpha}$:\n$$ \\beta_{\\mathrm{W}} = \\frac{5}{3} $$\nThis value represents the effective number of distinct communities in the region, reflecting the degree of compositional turnover among them.\n\nThe problem requires the final result as an ordered triple $(\\bar{\\alpha}, \\gamma, \\beta_{\\mathrm{W}})$. Based on our derivations, the components of this triple are:\nMean local richness, $\\bar{\\alpha} = 3$.\nRegional richness, $\\gamma = 5$.\nWhittaker beta diversity, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{W}} = \\frac{5}{3}$.\n\nThe final result is provided in exact fractional form as required.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 5 & \\frac{5}{3} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2470400"}, {"introduction": "A single beta diversity value tells us that communities differ, but not *how* they differ.

Turnover represents the replacement of species from one site to another, while nestedness represents the degree to which species-poor sites are subsets of species-rich sites.\n\nThe partitioning will be based on the Sørensen index of dissimilarity ($\\beta_{sor}$) and its components. For any pair of sites with $a$ shared species, $b$ species unique to the first site, and $c$ species unique to the second site, the indices are calculated as follows:\n1.  The pairwise Sørensen dissimilarity:\n    $$ \\beta_{sor} = \\frac{b+c}{2a+b+c} $$\n2.  The pairwise turnover component, given by the Simpson dissimilarity index:\n    $$ \\beta_{sim} = \\frac{\\min(b,c)}{a + \\min(b,c)} $$\n\nThe pairwise nestedness component, $\\beta_{nes}$, is the portion of $\\beta_{sor}$ not accounted for by turnover, i.e., $\\beta_{nes} = \\beta_{sor} - \\beta_{sim}$.\n\nTo obtain a single measure for the entire lake system, you must calculate the average value of each index across all possible pairs of lakes.
