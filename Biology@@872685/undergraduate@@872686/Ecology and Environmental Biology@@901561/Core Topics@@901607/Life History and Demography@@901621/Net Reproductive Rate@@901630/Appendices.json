At the start of Year 1 (age class $x=0$), these seeds germinated into seedlings. Of this initial cohort, 350 individuals survived to the start of Year 2 (age class $x=1$). First-year plants (age class 0) do not produce seeds, so their age-specific fecundity ($m_0$) is 0. The surviving second-year plants (age class 1) produce an average of 9.5 seeds each ($m_1 = 9.5$) before they die.\n\nUsing this life table data, calculate the net reproductive rate, $R_0$, for this Cinderbloom population.
