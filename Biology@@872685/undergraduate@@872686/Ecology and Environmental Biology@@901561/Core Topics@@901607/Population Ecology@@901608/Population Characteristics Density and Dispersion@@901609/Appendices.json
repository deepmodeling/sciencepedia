The standard field protocol involves using square quadrats of side length $L = 0.25$ meters to sample the population. For each quadrat deployed, the total number of individual barnacles, $N$, is counted.\n\nA new research assistant, tasked with calculating the mean population density from a recent survey, misinterprets the data analysis protocol. Instead of calculating density as count per unit area, the assistant establishes a procedure where, for each quadrat, they calculate a \"density index\" by dividing the number of barnacles counted ($N$) by the side length of the quadrat ($L$). They then compute the arithmetic mean of these individual \"density indices\" from all quadrats to report a single value as the final mean population density for the surveyed area.\n\nThe counts from the five quadrats in the recent survey are as follows:\n- Quadrat 1: 12 individuals\n- Quadrat 2: 8 individuals\n- Quadrat 3: 15 individuals\n- Quadrat 4: 11 individuals\n- Quadrat 5: 14 individuals\n\nYour task is to determine the magnitude of the assistant's procedural error.

One week later, a second sampling session is conducted, and a total of $C=110$ squirrels are captured. Of these, $R=28$ are found to be marked from the first session.\n\nAfter reviewing footage from cameras placed near the traps, the ecologist discovers a behavioral bias. The squirrels have learned to associate the traps with a food reward, a phenomenon known as being \"trap-happy\".

By analyzing whether individuals are clumped, uniform, or randomly distributed, we can infer processes like facilitation or competition.

A common observation is that these bushes exhibit a remarkably uniform dispersion pattern. The prevailing hypothesis is that this uniformity arises from intense below-ground competition for limited water resources.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, the ecologist establishes two large, adjacent plots of land with similar initial conditions.\n- **Control Plot:** The plot is left undisturbed, receiving only natural rainfall.\n- **Supplemented Plot:** This plot receives a regular, substantial supply of additional water, effectively eliminating water as a limiting resource.\n\nAfter several years, allowing the plant community to respond, the ecologist divides each plot into a grid of 10 identical quadrats and counts the number of established creosote bushes in each. The counts are as follows:\n\n- **Control Plot Quadrat Counts:** `{3, 3, 2, 4, 3, 4, 2, 3, 3, 3}`\n- **Supplemented Plot Quadrat Counts:** `{3, 1, 4, 0, 5, 2, 6, 2, 4, 3}`\n\nGiven these data, which of the following conclusions regarding the hypothesis is best supported?\n\nA.

Removing water limitation shifted the dispersion from uniform toward random, which supports the hypothesis that intense below-ground competition for water produces uniform spacing.\n\nRegarding the distractors: density (mean count) remained the same in both plots, but the hypothesis concerns pattern, not density, so unchanged density does not reject the hypothesis. The pattern clearly changed, and a sample of $10$ quadrats with a clear shift in $I$ is sufficient to detect the change.\n\nTherefore, the best-supported conclusion is that the hypothesis is supported because removing water competition caused the dispersion to shift toward random.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1873892"}]}
