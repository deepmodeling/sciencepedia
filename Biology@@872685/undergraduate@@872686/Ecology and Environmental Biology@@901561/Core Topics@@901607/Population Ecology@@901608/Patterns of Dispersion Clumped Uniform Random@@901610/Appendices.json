This exercise sharpens your interpretative skills by providing the statistical summary—a mean and a variance—and asking you to connect the resulting pattern to a plausible biological mechanism.

To quantify its distribution pattern, the ecologist uses a standard quadrat sampling method. A large number of square quadrats, each with an area of 1 square meter, are randomly placed throughout the study site, and the number of isopod burrow entrances is counted within each quadrat. After compiling the data, the analysis yields a sample mean of $\\bar{x} = 3.2$ burrow entrances per quadrat and a sample variance of $s^2 = 15.8$.\n\nBased on these statistical results, which of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the isopods' dispersion pattern and a plausible ecological cause?\n\nA. The dispersion is uniform, suggesting that the isopods are solitary and engage in intense competition for resources, forcing them to maintain a minimum distance from one another.\n\nB. The dispersion is random, indicating that the presence of one isopod has no influence on the location of another, which would be expected if key resources were distributed homogeneously.\n\nC. The dispersion is clumped, implying that the isopods are aggregated in groups, possibly because the sandy soil conditions required for burrowing are patchily distributed or due to a social tendency to cluster.\n\nD. The dispersion cannot be determined from the mean and variance alone; concluding the pattern would require a complete census and mapping of every individual in the population.", "solution": "We are given counts of burrow entrances per unit-area quadrat.

Therefore, the statement that best matches both the statistical pattern (variance markedly exceeding the mean) and a biologically plausible cause is that the dispersion is clumped due to patchy habitat or social clustering. It is not necessary to fully census and map every individual to detect departure from randomness; the mean-variance relationship from quadrat counts already provides evidence of aggregation.\n\nHence, the correct choice is the clumped pattern with a plausible cause as described.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1870363"}, {"introduction": "Observing patterns and forming hypotheses are crucial, but the heart of science lies in rigorous testing. This practice immerses you in the logic of experimental ecology, where the goal is to untangle competing explanations for an observed distribution. By analyzing the results of a controlled transplant experiment, you will learn how to isolate variables like dispersal limitation and resource availability (both biotic and abiotic) to pinpoint the specific process driving a population's clumped pattern. [@problem_id:1870341]", "problem": "An ecologist is studying a rare alpine flower, *Floris alpina*, which is observed to grow only in dense, isolated clumps despite the surrounding terrain appearing suitable. Two primary hypotheses are proposed to explain this clumped distribution:\n1.  **Dispersal Limitation:** The plant's seeds are heavy and do not travel far from the parent plant.\n2.  **Resource Limitation:** The plant requires a specific soil property found only in the locations where it currently grows. This property could be either abiotic (e.g., a unique mineral concentration) or biotic (e.g., a symbiotic soil microbe).\n\nTo test these hypotheses, the ecologist conducts a controlled experiment. Soil is collected from two locations: a \"Patch Site\" where a dense clump of *F. alpina* is growing, and an adjacent \"Bare Site\" with similar elevation, slope, and sun exposure, but no *F. alpina* plants. A portion of the soil from each site is sterilized by autoclaving to kill all living organisms, including microbes and seeds, while leaving the abiotic chemical composition largely intact.\n\nFour treatment groups are established in a common environmental chamber, with 100 seeds of *F. alpina* planted in pots for each treatment:\n-   **Treatment A:** Seeds are planted in sterilized soil from the Patch Site.\n-   **Treatment B:** Seeds are planted in unsterilized (live) soil from the Patch Site.\n-   **Treatment C:** Seeds are planted in sterilized soil from the Bare Site.\n-   **Treatment D:** Seeds are planted in unsterilized (live) soil from the Bare Site.\n\nAfter a growing season, the number of surviving seedlings is counted for each treatment. The results are as follows:\n-   **Treatment A:** 7 survivors\n-   **Treatment B:** 89 survivors\n-   **Treatment C:** 5 survivors\n-   **Treatment D:** 6 survivors\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following conclusions is most strongly supported?\n\nA. The clumped distribution of *Floris alpina* is primarily explained by dispersal limitation.\n\nB. The clumped distribution of *Floris alpina* is primarily explained by its dependence on a specific abiotic soil property.\n\nC. The clumped distribution of *Floris alpina* is primarily explained by its dependence on a specific biotic component of the soil.\n\nD. Both dispersal limitation and abiotic soil properties are equally responsible for the clumped distribution.\n\nE. The experiment is fundamentally flawed and no valid conclusion can be drawn from the results.", "solution": "We begin by translating the two mechanistic hypotheses into testable predictions that separate abiotic from biotic soil effects.\n\nPrinciples:\n- Sterilization by autoclaving removes living components (microbes, viable seeds, pathogens, and mutualists) while leaving the abiotic chemical composition largely intact. Therefore, any difference between unsterilized (live) and sterilized soil from the same location isolates a biotic cause.\n- Comparing soils from Patch versus Bare sites evaluates whether the necessary factor is localized to the Patch sites or is widespread in nearby soils.\n\nPredictions:\n1. Dispersal limitation hypothesis: If clumping is due mainly to limited seed movement, then when seeds are supplied equally to all soil treatments under uniform environmental conditions, survival should not depend strongly on soil origin or sterilization state, provided the abiotic environment is suitable. In particular, seeds planted into Bare Site soils (live or sterilized) should establish at rates comparable to Patch Site soils because the limitation has been removed experimentally by adding seeds.\n2. Abiotic-dependence hypothesis: If a specific abiotic soil property unique to Patch sites is required, then both sterilized and unsterilized Patch soils should support similarly high survival, because sterilization leaves abiotic chemistry intact. Bare Site soils (sterilized or live) should show low survival if they lack that abiotic property.\n3. Biotic-dependence hypothesis: If a specific biotic soil component is required (e.g., a mutualistic microbe), then unsterilized Patch soil should support high survival, sterilization of Patch soil should reduce survival substantially, and Bare Site soils (even when unsterilized) should show low survival if they lack the required biota.\n\nObserved results:\n- Treatment A (sterilized Patch): 7 survivors → low survival when Patch soil is sterilized.\n- Treatment B (live Patch): 89 survivors → high survival when Patch soil biota are present.\n- Treatment C (sterilized Bare): 5 survivors → low survival in sterilized Bare soil.\n- Treatment D (live Bare): 6 survivors → low survival in unsterilized Bare soil.\n\nLogical evaluation:\n- Dispersal limitation is not supported: Supplying seeds to Bare Site soils did not yield high survival (Treatments C and D both low). If dispersal were the primary cause, added seeds should have established broadly, not only in one treatment.\n- Abiotic-dependence is contradicted: If an abiotic Patch property were necessary and sufficient, sterilization would not reduce its effect. Yet sterilized Patch soil (A) has low survival, while live Patch soil (B) has high survival. Thus the critical factor cannot be purely abiotic.\n- Biotic-dependence is strongly supported: The dramatic contrast between live Patch (B, high) and sterilized Patch (A, low) indicates that a living component in Patch soil is necessary. The failure of live Bare soil (D) to support survival implies the beneficial biota are specific to Patch soils and absent from nearby Bare soils, consistent with a localized symbiont or other facilitative biotic agent.\n\nPotential confound of a Patch seed bank in unsterilized soil cannot explain the full pattern because the key diagnostic contrast is that sterilization of the same Patch soil collapses survival despite unchanged abiotic composition, which uniquely indicates the necessity of a biotic factor. Furthermore, live Bare soil, which could contain any generalized beneficial microbes, does not support survival, suggesting specificity of the Patch-associated biota.\n\nTherefore, the data most strongly support dependence on a specific biotic component of the soil localized to Patch sites.\n\nConclusion: Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1870341"}]}
