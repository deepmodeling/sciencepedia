This first practice challenges you to construct a Leslie matrix from fundamental life history data—fecundity and survival rates.

The study focuses on the female population, which is categorized into three distinct age classes based on an annual census: Juveniles (first-year birds), Subadults (second-year birds), and Adults (third-year birds). The life cycle is modeled such that all birds die after their third year.\n\nBased on several years of field data, the researchers have determined the following average annual vital rates for the female population:\n- Juveniles do not reproduce.\n- Each subadult female produces 0.8 new female juveniles that survive to be counted in the next census.\n- Each adult female produces 1.5 new female juveniles that survive to be counted in the next census.\n- The probability of a juvenile surviving one year to become a subadult is 0.3.\n- The probability of a subadult surviving one year to become an adult is 0.6.\n\nAt the beginning of the study (year $t=0$), the census records a population of 200 juvenile females, 100 subadult females, and 50 adult females.
