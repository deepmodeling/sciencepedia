Using the point-slope form of a linear equation with the point $(100, 0.64)$:\n$$r_{pc} - 0.64 = -0.0016 (N - 100)$$\n$$r_{pc} = -0.0016N + 0.16 + 0.64$$\n$$r_{pc} = 0.8 - 0.0016N$$\nThus, $c = 0.8$.\n\nThe carrying capacity, $K$, is defined as the population size at which the population growth rate is zero.
