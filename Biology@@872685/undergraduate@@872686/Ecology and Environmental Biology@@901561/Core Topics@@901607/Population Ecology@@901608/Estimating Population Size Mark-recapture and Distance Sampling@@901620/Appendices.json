{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Let's begin with the foundational technique for estimating the size of an animal population: the Lincoln-Petersen estimator. This method is elegant in its simplicity, relying on the logic of proportions to make an educated guess about a total you cannot directly count. By capturing, marking, and releasing a known number of individuals and then resampling the population, we can use the ratio of marked to unmarked animals to estimate the entire population size, as demonstrated in this introductory exercise [@problem_id:1846111].", "problem": "A conservation biologist is working to estimate the population size of a newly discovered and critically endangered species of desert tortoise, *Gopherus agassizii novus*, which is endemic to a small, isolated canyon system. To do this without disturbing the entire population, the biologist employs a mark-recapture technique.\n\nOn the first visit to the canyon, the biologist captures, non-destructively marks the shell of, and releases $M = 8$ tortoises.\n\nTwo months later, allowing for the marked individuals to reintegrate fully into the population, the biologist returns for a second survey. During this second visit, a total of $C = 12$ tortoises are captured. Upon inspection, it is found that $R = 1$ of these captured tortoises bears the mark from the first visit.\n\nAssuming the population is closed (i.e., there are no births, deaths, immigration, or emigration between the two visits), that all tortoises have an equal probability of being captured, and that no marks were lost, calculate the estimated total population size, $N$, for this species of tortoise in the canyon. Provide your answer as a whole number.", "solution": "We use the Lincoln–Petersen estimator under the stated assumptions (closed population, equal capture probability, no mark loss). After the first visit, the fraction of marked individuals in the population is $M/N$. In the second sample, the fraction of marked individuals observed is $R/C$.

After a period of $T=10$ days, the ecologist returns to conduct a second survey. However, a parallel study has revealed a complication: while the paint is harmless to the snails' physiology, its conspicuous color makes them more vulnerable to predation by birds. This study determined that the daily survival probability for an unmarked snail is $s_{u} = 0.98$, whereas the daily survival probability for a snail marked with the paint is $s_{m} = 0.95$. These probabilities are constant for each day of the 10-day period.\n\nIn the second survey, the ecologist captures a total of $C=350$ snails. Among these, $R=50$ are found to bear the paint mark from the initial capture.\n\nUsing this information, calculate the best estimate for the total number of snails, $N$, in the park at the time of the initial marking.

Working through this problem will give you a glimpse into how modern ecological studies unravel the intricate processes that govern population structure and change over time.", "problem": "An ecological research team is studying the population dynamics of a fictional species, the Aetherean Glass Salamander, in a protected wetland ecosystem. This species has a complex life cycle with two distinct post-larval stages: a terrestrial juvenile stage (State J) and an aquatic adult stage (State A). Adults are known to be obligately aquatic and cannot revert to the juvenile stage.\n\nTo estimate demographic parameters, the team conducted a three-year mark-recapture study. At the beginning of the study period each year (Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3), they captured, identified, marked (if new), and released a sample of individuals. The life stage of each captured individual was recorded. For this analysis, you may assume that survival probabilities ($\\phi$), transition probabilities ($\\psi$), and capture probabilities ($p$) are constant over the three-year study period, although they may vary by life stage. The transition probability $\\psi^{JA}$ is defined as the conditional probability that a juvenile surviving from one year to the next transitions into the adult stage.\n\nThe summarized data from the study are as follows:\n- **Releases:**\n  - Year 1: 200 marked juveniles ($R_1^J$) and 100 marked adults ($R_1^A$) were released.\n  - Year 2: 250 marked juveniles ($R_2^J$) and 150 marked adults ($R_2^A$) were released.\n- **Recaptures of Marked Individuals:**\n  - In Year 2, recaptures from the Year 1 release cohort included: 14 individuals that were juveniles in both years ($m_{12}^{JJ}$), 24 individuals that transitioned from juvenile to adult ($m_{12}^{JA}$), and 40 individuals that remained adults ($m_{12}^{AA}$).\n  - In Year 3, recaptures from the Year 2 release cohort included: 18 individuals that were juveniles in both years ($m_{23}^{JJ}$), 30 individuals that transitioned from juvenile to adult ($m_{23}^{JA}$), and 60 individuals that remained adults ($m_{23}^{AA}$).\n  - No instances of adults being recaptured as juveniles ($m^{AJ}$) were observed.\n- **Total Captures in Year 2:**\n  - A total of 200 juveniles ($C_2^J$) and 400 adults ($C_2^A$) were captured in Year 2.\n\nAdditionally, two key parameters are considered known from separate, highly accurate studies:\n- From a fine-scale telemetry study on a subset of the population, the annual capture probability for adults is known to be $p^A = 0.50$.\n- A parallel laboratory study established the annual survival probability for juveniles to be $\\phi^J = 0.60$.\n\nUsing the provided data and known parameters, calculate the following five quantities:\n1.

We will use the provided summary statistics and known parameters to derive the unknown quantities step-by-step. The core of the method relies on relating the expected number of recaptures to the demographic parameters.\n\nThe expected number of individuals released in state $r$ at time $i$ and recaptured in state $s$ at time $i+1$, denoted $E[m_{i,i+1}^{rs}]$, is given by the model:\n$$E[m_{i,i+1}^{rs}] = R_i^r \\phi^r \\psi^{rs} p^s$$\nwhere $R_i^r$ is the number of marked individuals released in state $r$ at time $i$, $\\phi^r$ is the annual survival probability for state $r$, $\\psi^{rs}$ is the conditional probability of transitioning from state $r$ to state $s$ upon survival, and $p^s$ is the capture probability for state $s$. We assume these parameters are constant over time.\n\nBased on the problem description, we have two states J (juvenile) and A (adult). The biological constraint that adults cannot revert to juveniles implies $\\psi^{AJ}=0$, and therefore $\\psi^{AA}=1$ (an adult that survives remains an adult). For juveniles, they can either remain juveniles or transition to adults, so $\\psi^{JJ} + \\psi^{JA} = 1$.\n\n**Step 1: Estimate the adult survival probability, $\\phi^A$.**\nThe number of marked adults released at time $i$ and recaptured as adults at time $i+1$ is given by $m_{i,i+1}^{AA}$. The expected value is $E[m_{i,i+1}^{AA}] = R_i^A \\phi^A \\psi^{AA} p^A = R_i^A \\phi^A p^A$.\nWe have data from two intervals (Year 1 to 2, and Year 2 to 3). To get a more robust estimate, we can pool the data:\n$$m_{12}^{AA} + m_{23}^{AA} \\approx (R_1^A + R_2^A) \\phi^A p^A$$\nWe can solve for the product $\\phi^A p^A$:\n$$\\hat{\\phi}^A \\hat{p}^A = \\frac{m_{12}^{AA} + m_{23}^{AA}}{R_1^A + R_2^A} = \\frac{40 + 60}{100 + 150} = \\frac{100}{250} = 0.40$$\nThe problem states that the adult capture probability $p^A = 0.50$ is known.

The expected value is $E[m_{i,i+1}^{JJ}] = R_i^J \\phi^J \\psi^{JJ} p^J$. Since $\\psi^{JJ} = 1 - \\psi^{JA}$, this is $E[m_{i,i+1}^{JJ}] = R_i^J \\phi^J (1 - \\psi^{JA}) p^J$.\nPooling the data as before:\n$$m_{12}^{JJ} + m_{23}^{JJ} \\approx (R_1^J + R_2^J) \\phi^J (1 - \\psi^{JA}) p^J$$\nWe solve for the three-parameter product:\n$$\\hat{\\phi}^J (1-\\hat{\\psi}^{JA}) \\hat{p}^J = \\frac{m_{12}^{JJ} + m_{23}^{JJ}}{R_1^J + R_2^J} = \\frac{14 + 18}{200 + 250} = \\frac{32}{450}$$\nWe know $\\phi^J = 0.60$ and we have just estimated $\\psi^{JA} = 0.40$.
