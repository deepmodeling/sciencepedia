By understanding the spatial requirements of a species, we can estimate the carrying capacity of a given habitat, a crucial first step in planning reintroductions or managing protected areas.

The preserve has a total area of 25,000 hectares. Ecological surveys have determined that only 78% of this land consists of the sandy and stony desert terrain that constitutes suitable habitat for the Sand Cat. The remaining area is composed of rocky cliffs and salt flats where the cats cannot hunt or establish dens.\n\nPrevious studies on Sand Cat populations have shown that each individual cat maintains an exclusive, non-overlapping circular territory with an average radius of 2.1 km. To ensure the long-term viability of the reintroduced population, the team needs to estimate the preserve's carrying capacity based on these spatial requirements.\n\nAssuming that territories must be fully contained within the suitable habitat area and cannot overlap, calculate the maximum number of Sand Cats that the preserve can support.

This problem asks you to identify the correct procedure for constructing an MCP, forcing you to think critically about the definition and distinguish it from other plausible but incorrect spatial metrics [@problem_id:1885237].", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the spatial ecology of a great white shark (*Carcharodon carcharias*) in a coastal region. Using satellite telemetry, the ecologist has collected a set of 50 Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates, each representing the shark's location at a specific point in time over a one-month observation period. To estimate the shark's home range, the ecologist decides to use the Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) method. The MCP is defined as the smallest possible convex polygon that encloses all of the observed location points.\n\nWhich one of the following procedures correctly describes the fundamental process for determining the home range area using the MCP method based on the collected GPS data?\n\nA. Calculate the geographic mean (centroid) of all 50 coordinates. The home range is then defined as the area of a circle centered at this centroid, with a radius equal to the average distance from the centroid to all 50 points.\n\nB.
