This exercise [@problem_id:2277852] presents a classic scenario of an alarm call, a common form of altruism in social animals. By working through this problem, you will practice the core calculation of inclusive fitness, learning how to weigh the cost to the altruist against the total benefit received by relatives, correctly adjusted by their coefficient of relatedness ($r$).", "problem": "In a population of a diploid, sexually-reproducing ground-dwelling mammal, an individual can perform an altruistic act by sounding an alarm call upon spotting a predator. This action alerts other members of its social group but increases the caller's personal probability of being captured.\n\nLet the fitness cost, $C$, to the individual giving the call be defined as $C = 0.05$. The alarm call is heard by a nearby group consisting of four of the caller's full siblings. For each of these four siblings, the warning provides a fitness benefit, $B_{\\text{ind}}$, of $0.10$.\n\nAccording to the principles of kin selection and inclusive fitness, would this altruistic behavior be evolutionarily favored in this specific scenario? Select the option that provides the correct conclusion and reasoning.\n\nA. Yes, because the total benefit to the siblings ($0.40$) is greater than the cost to the caller ($0.05$).\n\nB. Yes, because the relatedness-weighted benefit ($0.20$) is greater than the direct fitness cost to the caller ($0.05$).\n\nC. No, because any behavior that incurs a personal fitness cost, however small, will be selected against by natural selection.\n\nD. No, because the fitness benefit to a single sibling ($0.10$) is not large enough to justify the cost to the caller ($0.05$).\n\nE. No, because the relatedness-weighted benefit ($0.20$) is less than the total benefit accrued by the siblings ($0.40$).", "solution": "Apply Hamilton's rule from kin selection: an altruistic behavior is favored when the inclusive fitness condition $r \\sum B_{i} > C$ holds, where $r$ is the coefficient of relatedness between the actor and each recipient, $B_{i}$ is the fitness benefit to recipient $i$, and $C$ is the fitness cost to the actor.\n\nFor full siblings in a diploid, sexually reproducing species without inbreeding, the coefficient of relatedness is $r = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThere are four full siblings, each receiving a benefit $B_{\\text{ind}} = 0.10$, so the total benefit across recipients is\n$$\nB_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} B_{i} = 4 \\times 0.10 = 0.40.\n$$\nThe relatedness-weighted benefit is therefore\n$$\nr B_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.40 = 0.20.\n$$\nCompare this to the direct cost $C = 0.05$.

Here, you must first determine the coefficient of relatedness between individuals in a hypothetical lion pride before you can assess the evolutionary trade-off. This practice will sharpen your skills in pedigree analysis and demonstrate how the specific kinship structure of a group influences the conditions under which altruism can evolve, allowing you to solve for the minimum benefit ($B$) required to favor a costly helpful act.", "problem": "In a simplified model of a lion pride's social dynamics, two dominant males, Male A and Male B, cooperate to defend the pride. These two males are half-brothers, sharing the same mother but having different fathers. We can assume the population is large and outbred, meaning their respective fathers are unrelated to each other and to their shared mother.\n\nMale A successfully sires a cub. One day, this cub is cornered by a hyena, and Male B has the opportunity to intervene and defend it. This act of defense is not without risk; undertaking the defense imposes a fitness cost on Male B, which is quantified as a loss of $0.35$ in his expected future reproductive success (i.e., cost $C = 0.35$). For this altruistic act of defense to be an evolutionarily stable strategy favored by kin selection, the fitness benefit to the cub must outweigh the cost to Male B, as weighted by their genetic relatedness.\n\nAssuming diploid genetics, calculate the minimum fitness benefit ($B$) that the cub must receive for Male B's altruistic behavior to be favored. Express your answer as a real number.", "solution": "We use Hamilton’s rule for kin selection: an altruistic act is favored when $rB > C$, where $r$ is the coefficient of relatedness between actor and recipient, $B$ is the fitness benefit to the recipient, and $C$ is the fitness cost to the actor.\n\nFirst, compute the relatedness $r$ between Male B and the cub sired by Male A.

Using a hypothetical case of cannibalism among tadpoles, you are asked to calculate the critical coefficient of relatedness ($r_{crit}$) that marks the tipping point between selfish and altruistic behavior.

The baseline probability for any given tadpole to survive to metamorphosis and reproduce is $p_s = 0.22$.\n2.  Consuming another tadpole provides a nutritional benefit that increases the cannibal's own probability of survival to metamorphosis by an absolute amount of $\\Delta p = 0.08$. The consumed tadpole's survival probability becomes zero.\n3.  The expected number of offspring for any individual that successfully survives to metamorphosis is a constant, $F$. This value is the same for all survivors.\n\nAn altruistic decision to spare a relative is considered evolutionarily favorable if the fitness benefit to the relative, weighted by the coefficient of relatedness, exceeds the fitness cost to the actor.
