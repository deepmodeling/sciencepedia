[@problem_id:1835861]", "problem": "In a temperate forest ecosystem, several species interactions are observed on and around a fallen log. Consider the following three distinct interactions, labeled A, B, and C:\n\n**Interaction A**: A large, mature oak tree casts a dense shadow over the forest floor. At the base of the oak, a small, light-demanding wildflower species attempts to grow. Due to the low light conditions created by the oak's canopy, the wildflower's growth is severely stunted and it fails to produce seeds. The large oak tree is entirely unaffected by the presence of the tiny wildflower beneath it.\n\n**Interaction B**: A species of shelf fungus is growing on a fallen, dead log. The metabolic activity of the fungus breaks down the tough woody material, creating softened pockets and galleries within the log. These modified areas provide a crucial protected habitat for the larvae of a jewel beetle species. Without the fungus's preparatory action, the log would be too hard for the larvae to inhabit. The fungus, in turn, is not measurably harmed or benefited by the beetle larvae living within the wood it is decomposing.\n\n**Interaction C**: After completing their larval stage, the jewel beetles emerge as winged adults. These adult beetles fly to the canopy of the living oak tree described in Interaction A and feed on its leaves for sustenance. This consumption of leaf tissue represents a loss of photosynthetic capacity and biomass for the oak tree.\n\nBased on these descriptions, which of the following options correctly classifies the ecological relationship for Interaction A, Interaction B, and Interaction C, respectively?\n\nA.

The oak is unaffected by the wildflower’s presence. This is negative for the wildflower and neutral for the oak, which matches amensalism.\n\nInteraction B: The fungus decomposes the dead log, creating softened galleries that enable jewel beetle larvae to inhabit the wood; the fungus is not measurably affected by the larvae’s presence. This is positive for the beetle larvae and neutral for the fungus, which matches commensalism.\n\nInteraction C: Adult beetles feed on leaves of the living oak, reducing its photosynthetic capacity and biomass, while the beetles gain resources. This is positive for the beetles and negative for the oak, which is exploitation (specifically herbivory).\n\nComparing to the options, the sequence Amensalism, Commensalism, Exploitation corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1835861"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand the consequences of species interactions, ecologists often translate them into the language of mathematics. This problem guides you through the process of modeling a classic commensal relationship, where one species directly benefits from the presence of another that remains unaffected.

The population dynamics of these two species are described by a coupled system of logistic growth equations.\n\nThe tree population, denoted by $N_T$, is unaffected by the presence of the liana. Its population dynamics follow a standard logistic growth model, with an intrinsic rate of increase $r_T$ and a carrying capacity $K_T$.\n\nThe liana population, denoted by $N_L$, benefits from the structural support provided by the trees, which increases its access to sunlight and other resources. Consequently, its growth is also logistic, with an intrinsic rate of increase $r_L$, but its carrying capacity, $K_L$, is not a fixed value. Instead, it is a linear function of the tree population size:\n$$K_L(N_T) = K_{L0} + \\beta N_T$$\nHere, $K_{L0}$ represents the liana's baseline carrying capacity on the forest floor in the complete absence of trees, and $\\beta$ is a positive constant known as the \"commensal support coefficient,\" which quantifies the additional carrying capacity for the liana population provided by a single tree.

[@problem_id:1835825]", "problem": "In an ecosystem, an amensalistic relationship exists between a species of night-flying moth and a particular orchid species. The moth's reproductive success hinges on a precise chemical signal. A female moth emits a two-component sex pheromone, consisting of component A and component B, at constant rates of $Q_A = 12.0$ nanograms per hour and $Q_B = 60.0$ nanograms per hour, respectively. A male moth can only successfully navigate towards a female if the perceived concentration ratio of component A to component B, denoted as $R_p$, is within a narrow tolerance window around the emitted ratio. Specifically, successful mate location requires that $R_p$ satisfies the condition $R_0(1-\\delta) \\le R_p \\le R_0(1+\\delta)$, where $R_0 = Q_A/Q_B$ is the ratio at the source, and the tolerance factor is $\\delta = 0.25$.\n\nThe orchid passively releases a fragrant volatile that is chemically identical to the moth's pheromone component A. The emission rate of this mimic compound from the orchid, $Q_{orchid}$, is $600.0$ nanograms per hour. This interference can disrupt the moth's mating a \"zone of confusion\" around the orchid.\n\nTo model this scenario, assume that the concentration $C$ of any emitted compound at a distance $r$ from its point source follows a simplified inverse-square dispersion law, $C(r) = Q/(\\beta r^2)$, where $Q$ is the emission rate and $\\beta$ is an atmospheric dispersion coefficient that is constant for all compounds.
