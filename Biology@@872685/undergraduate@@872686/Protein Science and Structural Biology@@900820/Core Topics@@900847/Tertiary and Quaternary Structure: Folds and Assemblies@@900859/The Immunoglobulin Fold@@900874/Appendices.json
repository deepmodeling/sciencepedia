This exercise demonstrates the fundamental principle of how a protein's primary sequence dictates its three-dimensional arrangement.

In a β-sheet, the constituent β-strands are characterized by a repeating pattern where the side chains of adjacent amino acid residues point in opposite directions relative to the plane of the sheet.\n\nConsider a seven-residue peptide segment, `Val-Thr-Leu-Thr-Cys-Leu-Ile`, which forms a single β-strand that is part of one of the β-sheets in an Ig-like domain. The side chain of the first residue, Valine (Val), is oriented inward, pointing directly into the hydrophobic core of the protein. The relevant amino acids have the following properties: Valine (Val), Leucine (Leu), and Isoleucine (Ile) are strongly hydrophobic; Threonine (Thr) is polar; Cysteine (Cys) is also generally hydrophobic and is frequently found within the core of Ig domains.\n\nBased on the principle of alternating side-chain orientation in a β-strand, which of the following choices correctly identifies the complete set of residues from this segment that are buried in the hydrophobic core?\n\nA.

If the first residue is inward, then all odd-numbered residues are inward and all even-numbered residues are outward.\n\nLabel the residues by position $i=1$ to $7$:\n1: Val, 2: Thr, 3: Leu, 4: Thr, 5: Cys, 6: Leu, 7: Ile.\n\nGiven that residue $1$ (Val) points inward, the inward-facing positions are the odd indices $i \\in \\{1,3,5,7\\}$. Therefore, the residues buried in the hydrophobic core are Val (1), Leu (3), Cys (5), and Ile (7).

This thought experiment invites you to predict the consequences of breaking this critical link on the protein's overall stability, measured by its melting temperature ($T_m$). This practice will deepen your understanding of the thermodynamic forces, particularly the role of conformational entropy, that hold a protein together [@problem_id:2144237].", "problem": "The Immunoglobulin (Ig) domain is one of the most common protein folds found in nature, forming the basis for antibodies and a vast array of cell surface receptors. The canonical Ig domain structure consists of a beta-sandwich, where two anti-parallel beta-sheets are packed against each other. A key, highly conserved feature of most Ig domains is a single intradomain disulfide bond that covalently links a cysteine residue on one beta-sheet to a cysteine residue on the other, effectively \"stapling\" the sandwich together.\n\nThe thermal stability of a protein is often characterized by its melting temperature ($T_m$), which is the temperature at which 50% of the protein population is in the denatured (unfolded) state. A higher $T_m$ indicates greater stability.\n\nImagine a biochemical experiment where a specific Ig domain is subjected to site-directed mutagenesis. One of the two conserved cysteine residues forming the disulfide bond is mutated to an alanine residue. Alanine is a small, non-polar amino acid that cannot form disulfide bonds.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the effect of this Cys-to-Ala mutation on the structural integrity and melting temperature ($T_m$) of the Ig domain, compared to the wild-type (unmutated) protein?\n\nA. The protein will likely still fold into a recognizably correct beta-sandwich structure, but its thermodynamic stability will be significantly reduced, resulting in a lower melting temperature ($T_m$).\n\nB. The protein will be completely unable to fold into the correct beta-sandwich structure and will primarily exist as an unfolded random coil at physiological temperatures.\n\nC. The melting temperature ($T_m$) of the protein will increase because breaking the rigid covalent disulfide bond allows the beta-sheets more conformational freedom to form stronger, more optimal hydrophobic interactions.\n\nD. The overall structure and the melting temperature ($T_m$) will be virtually unchanged because the hydrophobic interactions between the beta-sheets are the sole determinants of the protein's fold and stability.\n\nE. The protein will fold correctly into two separate beta-sheets, but these sheets will no longer associate with each other to form the beta-sandwich and will exist as independent structures in solution.", "solution": "We consider the Ig domain as a two-state folder with folded (F) and unfolded (U) states in equilibrium. The thermodynamic stability is governed by the Gibbs free energy change on folding,\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}} = \\Delta H_{\\text{fold}} - T \\Delta S_{\\text{fold}}.\n$$\nAt the melting temperature, by definition, the populations of F and U are equal, so the equilibrium constant is $K=1$, which implies\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}(T_{m}) = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad T_{m} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{fold}}}{\\Delta S_{\\text{fold}}}.\n$$\nA covalent disulfide bond within a domain acts as an intramolecular crosslink that reduces the conformational entropy of the unfolded ensemble. In folding thermodynamics, the entropic term is dominated by the loss of conformational entropy upon folding, so $\\Delta S_{\\text{fold}}<0$. Introducing a disulfide reduces the magnitude of the entropic penalty, making $\\Delta S_{\\text{fold}}$ less negative (i.e., increases $\\Delta S_{\\text{fold}}$ toward zero), which stabilizes the folded state (more negative $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ at a given $T$) and increases $T_{m}$ if $\\Delta H_{\\text{fold}}$ is approximately unchanged.\n\nConversely, mutating one cysteine to alanine eliminates the disulfide, increasing the conformational entropy of the unfolded state and thereby making the entropic penalty of folding larger in magnitude. In the sign convention above, this makes $\\Delta S_{\\text{fold}}$ more negative.

While the disulfide is a conserved stabilizing element, many Ig-like domains can still adopt a recognizably correct fold without it, albeit with reduced thermodynamic stability and increased susceptibility to unfolding and aggregation. Therefore, complete inability to fold is unlikely in general, and claims that $T_{m}$ increases or remains unchanged contradict the thermodynamic role of the disulfide crosslink. The notion that the two beta-sheets would exist as independent structures in solution is incompatible with a single polypeptide chain and the cooperative nature of the fold.\n\nThus, the most accurate prediction is that the domain can still fold into a recognizably correct beta-sandwich but with significantly reduced stability and a lower $T_{m}$ compared to wild type.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2144237"}, {"introduction": "The immunoglobulin fold is one of the most widespread domains in the human proteome, but how do we find all of its instances? This practical exercise bridges theoretical knowledge with essential bioinformatics skills, guiding you through the process of using a real-world database like Pfam. By devising an efficient search strategy, you will learn how to leverage powerful computational tools to identify and classify protein families on a genomic scale [@problem_id:2144243].", "problem": "A student in an introductory structural biology course is assigned a project to identify all proteins encoded in the human reference proteome that contain at least one immunoglobulin-like domain. The primary tool for this task is the Protein families (Pfam) database, a large collection of protein domain families, each represented by multiple sequence alignments and profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The student must devise a strategy to query the Pfam database through its public web interface to generate this list of human proteins.\n\nWhich of the following describes the most effective and direct strategy to accomplish this task?\n\nA. Download the amino acid sequence of a single, well-characterized immunoglobulin protein (e.g., the heavy chain of a human IgG antibody). Use this sequence as a query for a protein-protein Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search against the entire human proteome.\n\nB. Navigate to the Pfam homepage and use the keyword search function with the term `Homo sapiens`. From the human proteome page, manually click into the entry for each of the ~20,000 proteins and visually inspect its domain architecture diagram to check for the presence of an immunoglobulin domain.\n\nC. Use the search bar on the Pfam homepage to search for the keyword \"immunoglobulin\". Identify the primary Pfam-A family accession for the immunoglobulin domain (which is PF00047) from the search results. Access the page for this domain family and use the provided tools on that page to view all associated proteins specifically from the *Homo sapiens* proteome.\n\nD. Perform a \"sequence search\" on the Pfam website by pasting the entire human proteome (all ~20,000 protein sequences) into the query box. The tool will then scan these sequences against the Pfam-A database of HMMs. Manually read through the raw output to find all lines corresponding to hits for the immunoglobulin domain.\n\nE. Browse the full list of Pfam \"Clans\" (superfamilies). Locate the Ig-like clan (CL0011) and, for each individual family within that clan (e.g., V-set, I-set, C1-set), navigate to its page and look at the \"Species Distribution\" chart to confirm the presence of *Homo sapiens*, then cross-reference with a separate protein database.", "solution": "Goal: generate a list of all proteins in the human reference proteome that contain at least one immunoglobulin-like domain using the Pfam public web interface. The most direct and effective approach should leverage Pfam’s domain-centric organization (profile HMMs for domain families) and its built-in species/proteome filtering to return protein-level matches.\n\nKey principle: Pfam is organized around domain families (Pfam-A), each represented by a profile HMM that detects the domain across proteins. To find all proteins containing a given domain in a particular species/proteome, the efficient method is to locate the correct Pfam domain family page and use its “Species” or “Proteomes” tools to retrieve the list of matching proteins from that species.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n\n- Option A: Using BLAST with a single immunoglobulin protein sequence against the human proteome is not domain-centric, is biased by the query sequence, and will miss remote homologs and domain variants. It is not the intended Pfam approach and is not efficient for domain-wide enumeration.\n\n- Option B: Manually inspecting domain architecture for ~20,000 human proteins is impractical and error-prone. Pfam provides domain-to-protein mappings precisely to avoid this.\n\n- Option C: Searching “immunoglobulin” on Pfam to locate the canonical immunoglobulin domain family (PF00047) and then using the family page’s built-in tools (e.g., “Species,” “Proteomes,” or “Matches” filtered to Homo sapiens) yields exactly the desired list of human proteins containing that domain. This directly exploits Pfam’s profile HMM for the immunoglobulin domain and its species/proteome filtering, providing a comprehensive, downloadable set of protein matches via the web interface.\n\n- Option D: Pasting the entire human proteome into Pfam’s sequence search is not feasible through the web interface (input limits, performance) and would require tedious manual parsing. It is neither efficient nor robust.\n\n- Option E: While the Ig-like clan (CL0011) encompasses multiple related families (e.g., V-set, I-set, C1-set), the proposed workflow—checking “Species Distribution” per family and cross-referencing externally—is cumbersome and does not directly produce a consolidated list within Pfam. Although clans are conceptually comprehensive, this method is not the most direct way to generate the required list via the Pfam interface.\n\nConclusion: The most effective and direct strategy via the Pfam web interface is to identify the immunoglobulin domain family (PF00047) and use the family page’s tools to list all matched human proteins.
