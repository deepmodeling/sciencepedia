Long before a 3D structure is available, we can use computational tools to predict the location of functional domains. This practice introduces hydropathy analysis, a fundamental bioinformatic method used to identify transmembrane domains—regions of the protein that are sufficiently hydrophobic to stably embed within a cell membrane. By applying the Kyte-Doolittle scale, you will practice translating sequence data into a structural hypothesis, a critical first step in characterizing membrane proteins [@problem_id:2127453].", "problem": "A biochemist is analyzing the primary structure of a newly sequenced protein, \"Aquaporin-Z,\" which is hypothesized to be an integral membrane protein responsible for water transport. To predict its topology, a hydropathy analysis based on the Kyte-Doolittle scale is performed. On this scale, a more positive hydropathy index indicates greater hydrophobicity, while a more negative index signifies greater hydrophilicity. The analysis involves calculating the average hydropathy index over a sliding window of 19 amino acids, a typical length for a single alpha-helical transmembrane segment.\n\nThe average hydropathy indices for five distinct, non-overlapping 19-amino-acid segments of the Aquaporin-Z polypeptide are listed below.\n\nA. Segment 22-40: Average Hydropathy Index = -2.8\n\nB. Segment 71-89: Average Hydropathy Index = +0.1\n\nC. Segment 105-123: Average Hydropathy Index = -1.9\n\nD. Segment 154-172: Average Hydropathy Index = +2.3\n\nE.

Transmembrane alpha-helical segments are typically hydrophobic stretches of approximately 19 amino acids. Therefore, the most plausible transmembrane domain is the 19-residue segment with the largest positive average hydropathy index.\n\nDefine the average hydropathy indices for the five non-overlapping segments as $H_{A}=-2.8$, $H_{B}=+0.1$, $H_{C}=-1.9$, $H_{D}=+2.3$, and $H_{E}=-3.5$. The candidate segment is selected by\n$$\n\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{i \\in \\{A,B,C,D,E\\}} H_{i}.\n$$\nCompute the comparison:\n- $H_{A}=-2.8$ (hydrophilic)\n- $H_{B}=+0.1$ (near-neutral, weakly hydrophobic)\n- $H_{C}=-1.9$ (hydrophilic)\n- $H_{D}=+2.3$ (strongly hydrophobic)\n- $H_{E}=-3.5$ (strongly hydrophilic)\n\nThe maximum is $H_{D}=+2.3$. Given the typical threshold for transmembrane helices being positive and substantially above zero, Segment 154-172 (D) is the most plausible transmembrane domain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2127453"}, {"introduction": "Once a protein's three-dimensional structure is determined, visualizing its domains is key to understanding its architecture and function. Molecular graphics programs like PyMOL are indispensable tools for structural biologists, allowing them to manipulate and color specific regions of a protein. This exercise provides practical experience with PyMOL, guiding you through the process of selectively coloring domains based on their residue numbers. Mastering this skill is essential for creating clear, informative figures for research presentations and publications that highlight the modular nature of protein structures [@problem_id:2127465].", "problem": "You are an undergraduate researcher analyzing the structure of the enzyme Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from *Escherichia coli*. You have loaded the crystal structure with the Protein Data Bank (PDB) identifier `1U8F` into the molecular visualization software PyMOL. For your analysis, you are focusing on a single monomer, chain A.\n\nChain A of this enzyme is known to be composed of two major structural and functional domains:\n1.  An N-terminal domain, which is responsible for binding the cofactor NAD, spanning residues 1 through 149.\n2.  A C-terminal domain, which contains the catalytic site, spanning residues 150 through 333.\n\nTo create a figure for your research presentation, you need to visually differentiate these two domains. Your plan is to color the entire N-terminal domain (residues 1-149) red and the entire C-terminal domain (residues 150-333) blue.\n\nWhich of the following single-line commands, when typed into the PyMOL command line, will correctly perform this coloring operation?\n\nA. `color red, resi 1-149; color blue, resi 150-333`\n\nB. `color red, name N; color blue, name C`\n\nC. `color red, resi 1:149 & color blue, resi 150:333`\n\nD. `color by_domain, red, blue`\n\nE. `color blue, resi 1-149; color red, resi 150-333`", "solution": "Goal: color the N-terminal domain (residues 1–149) red and the C-terminal domain (residues 150–333) blue for the selected structure in PyMOL, focusing on chain A. In PyMOL, the general syntax for coloring is “color <color>, <selection>”. Residue ranges are selected with “resi start-end”. Multiple commands can be placed on one line separated by semicolons. If one wanted to restrict to a specific chain, one would use “chain A and resi …”, but among the provided options, only residue-range selections without chain specifiers are offered.\n\nEvaluate each option against PyMOL syntax and the requested coloring:\n- Option A: “color red, resi 1-149; color blue, resi 150-333” correctly uses the “color” command with residue ranges and separates two commands by a semicolon. This achieves the exact requested mapping of colors to residue ranges. Although it does not specify “chain A”, it correctly performs the coloring operation for those residue ranges and is syntactically valid.\n- Option B: “color red, name N; color blue, name C” uses atom name selectors (“N” for backbone nitrogen and “C” for carbonyl carbon), not residue ranges. This does not correspond to domain coloring by residue indices, so it is incorrect.\n- Option C: “color red, resi 1:149 & color blue, resi 150:333” is incorrect for two reasons: PyMOL uses “start-end” (dash) for ranges, not colons, and “&” is a boolean operator inside a selection, not a command separator. The correct command separator is a semicolon.\n- Option D: “color by_domain, red, blue” is not a valid PyMOL command. There is no “by_domain” mode in the “color” command.\n- Option E: “color blue, resi 1-149; color red, resi 150-333” reverses the requested colors, assigning blue to the N-terminal domain and red to the C-terminal domain, so it does not satisfy the requirement.\n\nTherefore, only Option A correctly performs the requested coloring with valid PyMOL syntax.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2127465"}, {"introduction": "The modularity of proteins is not just a structural curiosity; it is often central to their function, particularly in enzymes that undergo conformational changes. Many enzymes consist of multiple domains connected by flexible linkers that act as hinges, allowing the domains to move relative to one another. This exercise presents a thought experiment where you must interpret a set of biochemical data—structural, binding, and kinetic—to deduce why replacing a flexible linker with a rigid one abolishes an enzyme's activity. This practice will challenge you to connect static structure with the dynamic motions required for catalysis, illustrating the concept of \"induced fit\" on a domain level [@problem_id:2127424].", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a hypothetical enzyme called \"Flexase,\" which is known to be a member of the kinase family. The native enzyme consists of two distinct globular domains, a larger N-terminal domain and a smaller C-terminal domain. These two domains are connected by a short, flexible peptide linker composed primarily of glycine and serine residues. The enzyme's catalytic active site is located in a cleft formed at the interface between the two domains.\n\nTo investigate the role of the linker, the biochemist creates a mutant version of Flexase. In this mutant, the original flexible linker is replaced by a rigid, alpha-helical peptide segment of the same length, composed of alanine and leucine residues. The biochemist then performs a series of experiments on both the native (wild-type) and the mutant enzyme, obtaining the following key results:\n\n1.  Circular Dichroism spectroscopy indicates that in the mutant enzyme, both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains have folded correctly into their native tertiary structures, and the new linker segment has successfully formed a stable alpha-helix.\n2.  Isothermal Titration Calorimetry experiments show that the mutant enzyme binds its primary substrate with a dissociation constant ($K_d$) that is nearly identical to that of the wild-type enzyme.\n3.  An enzyme kinetics assay reveals that while the wild-type enzyme exhibits robust catalytic activity, the mutant enzyme shows no detectable activity, even in the presence of saturating substrate concentrations.\n\nBased on these experimental observations, which of the following statements provides the most plausible explanation for the complete loss of function in the mutant Flexase?\n\nA. The rigid alpha-helical linker sterically obstructs the substrate's path to the binding site in the cleft.\n\nB. The replacement of the flexible linker with a rigid helix destabilizes the entire protein, causing it to unfold and aggregate.\n\nC. The catalytic mechanism requires a large-scale conformational change, such as a domain closure motion where the two domains pivot towards each other after substrate binding, which is prevented by the rigid linker.\n\nD. The amino acid substitutions in the linker fundamentally altered the electrostatic environment of the active site, rendering the catalytic residues non-functional.", "solution": "We interpret the experimental observations using standard binding and enzymatic kinetics principles. The isothermal titration calorimetry measurement of the substrate dissociation constant reports that the mutant and wild-type have nearly identical $K_{d}$, where $K_{d} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}}$. This indicates that the substrate-binding interactions in the active-site cleft are preserved to first order in the mutant. In particular, similar $K_{d}$ implies that affinities and the local binding-site geometry needed for ground-state ligand recognition are largely unchanged.\n\nThe enzyme kinetics assay shows that the wild-type has robust activity but the mutant has no detectable activity even at saturating substrate. Under Michaelis-Menten conditions, the initial velocity is given by\n$$\nv = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}} E_{0} S}{K_{M} + S}.\n$$\nIn the saturating limit $S \\gg K_{M}$, this reduces to\n$$\nv \\approx k_{\\text{cat}} E_{0}.\n$$\nThus, an absence of detectable activity at saturating substrate implies that $k_{\\text{cat}} \\approx 0$ for the mutant, indicating that the chemical step and/or essential conformational steps required to reach the catalytically competent state are abolished, rather than a deficiency in substrate binding. This conclusion is consistent with the unchanged $K_{d}$ and inconsistent with a simple substrate-access obstruction that would typically reduce apparent affinity.\n\nWe next evaluate the options:\n\nA. A steric obstruction of the substrate’s path to the binding site would be expected to reduce substrate binding or alter the observed $K_{d}$. Given that $K_{d}$ is nearly unchanged, and that the substrate evidently reaches the binding site, option A is not the most plausible explanation.\n\nB. Global destabilization, unfolding, or aggregation is contradicted by the circular dichroism data indicating correctly folded domains and a stable helix in the linker, and further contradicted by the preserved $K_{d}$, which requires an intact and properly folded binding site. Therefore, B is not supported.\n\nC. Many kinases require an induced-fit conformational change, often a domain-closure or hinge-bending motion that brings catalytic residues and cofactors into precise alignment, excludes bulk solvent, and stabilizes the transition state. Replacing a short, flexible glycine/serine-rich linker with a rigid alpha-helical segment plausibly restricts the relative motion of the two domains, preventing the necessary domain closure after substrate binding. This would keep $K_{d}$ similar (ground-state binding remains intact) while driving $k_{\\text{cat}}$ effectively to zero because the enzyme cannot attain the catalytically competent conformation. This directly explains the combination of observations.\n\nD. Altered electrostatics in the active site due to linker substitutions would typically affect both binding and catalysis. The observation that $K_{d}$ is nearly unchanged argues against a substantial electrostatic perturbation at the binding site. While subtle electrostatic changes could selectively impact transition-state stabilization, the more direct and encompassing explanation given the engineered increase in linker rigidity is the prevention of required conformational dynamics, as in option C.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation, consistent with unchanged substrate binding, preserved domain folding, and complete loss of catalytic turnover at saturating substrate, is that a required domain movement for catalysis is blocked by the rigid linker.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2127424"}]}
