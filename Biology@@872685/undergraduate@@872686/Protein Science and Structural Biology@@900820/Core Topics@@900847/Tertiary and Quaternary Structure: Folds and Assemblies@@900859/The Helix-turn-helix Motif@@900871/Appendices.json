This first practice explores the heart of the helix-turn-helix motif's function: the \"recognition helix.\" By considering a targeted mutation of a key amino acid [@problem_id:2143238], you will dissect how a single residue can be responsible for both recognizing a specific DNA sequence and ensuring the protein binds tightly to the DNA.", "problem": "In structural biology, the Helix-Turn-Helix (HTH) is a common DNA-binding protein motif. It consists of two alpha-helices joined by a short loop of amino acids. One of these helices, known as the \"recognition helix,\" fits into the major groove of the DNA double helix and makes specific contacts with the DNA bases, allowing the protein to recognize a particular nucleotide sequence.\n\nConsider a hypothetical bacterial transcription factor, named Factor-G, which utilizes an HTH motif to bind to its target operator sequence on the DNA. Structural analysis reveals that a critical interaction for sequence-specific binding involves an arginine residue at position 52 (Arg52) within the recognition helix. The side chain of Arg52 extends into the major groove and forms two specific hydrogen bonds with a guanine base in the operator sequence. Additionally, its positive charge contributes to the overall affinity for the negatively charged DNA backbone.\n\nA researcher creates a mutant version of Factor-G by site-directed mutagenesis, replacing the arginine at position 52 with an alanine (a mutation denoted as R52A). Based on the chemical properties of these amino acids, what is the most likely consequence of the R52A mutation on the interaction between Factor-G and its target DNA operator sequence?\n\nA. The mutant protein will bind to the target DNA sequence with significantly increased affinity.\n\nB. The mutant protein will be unable to fold into its correct three-dimensional structure.\n\nC. The mutant protein will exhibit a drastic reduction in both sequence specificity and overall binding affinity.\n\nD. The mutant protein will switch its binding preference from the major groove to the minor groove of the DNA.\n\nE. The mutant protein will lose its sequence specificity but will bind to any DNA sequence with the same high affinity as the original protein.", "solution": "We start from the structural and chemical roles of Arg52 in the recognition helix of a Helix-Turn-Helix motif. The side chain of arginine presents a guanidinium group that is both positively charged at physiological pH and capable of forming multiple directional hydrogen bonds. In the described complex, Arg52 forms two specific hydrogen bonds to a guanine base in the DNA major groove, establishing sequence-specific recognition, and also contributes favorable electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged DNA phosphate backbone.\n\nReplacing arginine with alanine (R52A) removes the guanidinium group entirely. The alanine side chain is a small, nonpolar methyl group, which:\n1) Cannot donate or accept hydrogen bonds in a way that substitutes for the two specific hydrogen bonds to guanine; thus sequence-specific base contacts are lost.\n2) Lacks the positive charge; thus the favorable electrostatic interaction with the DNA backbone is diminished, reducing overall binding affinity.\n\nThese two consequences together predict a drastic reduction in both sequence specificity (loss of base-specific hydrogen bonds in the major groove) and overall affinity (reduced electrostatics and loss of specific contacts). By contrast:\n- An increase in affinity (option A) is implausible because favorable interactions are being removed.\n- Global misfolding (option B) is unlikely from a single conservative-to-nonpolar substitution in a surface-exposed recognition position; HTH folds are generally robust to such single substitutions outside the hydrophobic core.\n- Switching to minor groove binding (option D) is not supported, as the HTH architecture and helix geometry determine major-groove insertion, and alanine does not introduce new minor-groove-specific interactions.\n- Loss of specificity but retention of high, nonspecific affinity (option E) is inconsistent with the loss of the positive charge and hydrogen bonds; nonspecific affinity should also decrease.\n\nTherefore, the most likely consequence is a drastic reduction in both sequence specificity and overall binding affinity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2143238"}, {"introduction": "Effective gene regulation requires not only strong binding but also highly specific binding. This exercise challenges you to distinguish between 'binding affinity' (the overall strength of interaction) and 'binding specificity' (the ability to tell the right DNA sequence from the wrong one). By analyzing a mutation outside the recognition helix [@problem_id:2143247], you'll learn how these two crucial properties can be independently affected, providing a more nuanced understanding of protein-DNA interactions.", "problem": "A hypothetical bacterial transcription factor uses a common structural motif, the Helix-Turn-Helix (HTH), to recognize and bind to a specific DNA sequence, its operator site. The binding free energy of this protein to DNA can be understood as an additive combination of two primary types of interactions:\n\n1.  **Sequence-Specific Interactions**: Hydrogen bonds formed between the amino acid side chains of the protein's \"recognition helix\" and the unique pattern of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors presented by the DNA bases in the major groove. This component is primarily responsible for recognizing the correct target sequence.\n2.  **Sequence-Nonspecific Interactions**: Electrostatic attractions (salt bridges) between positively charged amino acid residues on the protein surface (such as lysine or arginine) and the uniformly negative phosphodiester backbone of the DNA. This component contributes to the overall stability of the protein-DNA complex, regardless of the specific DNA sequence.\n\nWe define two key properties of this interaction:\n-   **Binding Affinity**: The overall strength of the protein's binding to its specific operator DNA sequence. Higher affinity means stronger binding.\n-   **Binding Specificity**: The protein's ability to discriminate between its specific operator sequence and other random, non-target (nonspecific) sequences in the genome. It is quantified as the ratio of the binding affinity for the specific site to the binding affinity for a nonspecific site.\n\nA scientist creates a mutant version of this transcription factor by replacing a single lysine residue with an alanine residue. This particular lysine was known to form a salt bridge with the DNA backbone but was not part of the recognition helix and did not interact with any DNA bases. The mutation does not alter the protein's three-dimensional structure.\n\nBased on this information, what is the most likely effect of this lysine-to-alanine mutation on the protein's binding affinity and binding specificity?\n\nA. Binding affinity decreases, and binding specificity increases.\n\nB. Binding affinity decreases, and binding specificity is unchanged.\n\nC.

The problem states to assume Chimera-X folds into a stable and functional HTH motif, implying that the recognition helix from RAPA is properly positioned to engage the major groove and make its characteristic base-specific contacts.\n\nConsequently, Chimera-X is expected to exhibit the sequence specificity of RAPA’s recognition helix.
