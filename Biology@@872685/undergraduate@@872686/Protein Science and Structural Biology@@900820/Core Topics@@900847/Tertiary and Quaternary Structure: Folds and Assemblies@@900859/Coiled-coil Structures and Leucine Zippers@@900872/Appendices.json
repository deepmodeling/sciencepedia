[@problem_id:2105806]", "problem": "Coiled-coils are a common structural motif in proteins, where two or more alpha-helices twist around each other to form a stable supercoil. The primary sequence of proteins that form coiled-coils often exhibits a characteristic seven-residue pattern known as a heptad repeat, denoted $(abcdefg)_n$. In a canonical coiled-coil, the residues at positions $a$ and $d$ are typically hydrophobic and pack together to form a buried core. The residues at positions $e$ and $g$, which flank the hydrophobic core, are often charged and can form stabilizing or destabilizing electrostatic interactions between helices.\n\nConsider a synthetic peptide with the repeating sequence `(LEALEGK)n`, which is known to be highly alpha-helical in solution. At neutral pH, the side chain of Glutamate (E) is negatively charged, and the side chain of Lysine (K) is positively charged.

Here, $a=\\mathrm{L}$ and $d=\\mathrm{L}$, giving a strong hydrophobic stripe that disfavors exposure to water and thus promotes oligomerization via a coiled-coil rather than a monomeric helix.\n- Positions $e$ and $g$ flank the core and often form interhelical electrostatic pairs. At neutral pH, $\\mathrm{E}$ is negatively charged (denote $\\mathrm{E}^{-}$) and $\\mathrm{K}$ is positively charged (denote $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$). Thus $e=\\mathrm{E}^{-}$ and $g=\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ provide complementary charges.\n\nOrientation determination by electrostatics:\n- In a parallel two-helix coiled-coil, the geometric register places $g$ of one helix opposite $e'$ of the partner and $e$ opposite $g'$ (where primes denote the facing positions on the partner helix). Therefore, the interhelical pairs are $g^{+}\\leftrightarrow e'^{-}$ and $e^{-}\\leftrightarrow g'^{+}$, both attractive salt bridges that stabilize the interface.\n- In an antiparallel two-helix coiled-coil, the register places like positions opposite each other across the interface, leading to $e^{-}\\leftrightarrow e'^{-}$ and $g^{+}\\leftrightarrow g'^{+}$, which are electrostatically repulsive and thus destabilizing.\n\nOligomeric state:\n- The presence of leucine at both $a$ and $d$ positions is characteristic of leucine zippers, which predominantly form dimers due to favorable knobs-into-holes packing in a two-helix interface. Trimers or higher oligomers typically require different core residue patterns at $a$ and $d$ to alter the supercoil geometry and packing; the given $a/d=\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{L}$ pattern most strongly supports a dimer.\n- A monomeric alpha-helix would expose the hydrophobic $a/d$ stripe to solvent and is disfavored in aqueous solution. A random coil is inconsistent with the high alpha-helical propensity of leucine, alanine, glutamate, and lysine, and with the designed heptad pattern promoting coiled-coils.\n\nTherefore, the most stable assembly at neutral pH is a parallel coiled-coil dimer stabilized by complementary $e/g$ interhelical salt bridges and a leucine-based $a/d$ hydrophobic core.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2105806"}, {"introduction": "Having established the rules for coiled-coil assembly, this practice challenges you to predict the consequences of breaking them. You will consider a common scenario in molecular biology—a single point mutation—and analyze its impact on protein stability. This thought experiment highlights the critical importance of the hydrophobic core in holding coiled-coils together and demonstrates why even small changes can have dramatic functional effects. [@problem_id:2105840]", "problem": "In structural biology, the coiled-coil is a common protein structural motif where two or more alpha-helices are coiled together like a rope. A well-known example is the leucine zipper, frequently found in transcription factors that must form dimers to function. The primary sequence of a leucine zipper domain is characterized by a heptad repeat, a repeating pattern of seven amino acids denoted as $(abcdefg)_n$. In this structure, the residues at the $a$ and $d$ positions form the buried interface between the helices and are crucial for dimerization. These positions are typically occupied by nonpolar amino acids.\n\nConsider a wild-type protein that contains a leucine zipper domain and readily forms a stable homodimer (a dimer of two identical protein chains). In this protein, a specific residue at a $d$ position of the heptad repeat is leucine, which is an amino acid with a nonpolar, hydrophobic side chain. A site-directed mutagenesis experiment is performed, creating a variant of this protein where this single leucine residue is replaced with an aspartic acid residue. Aspartic acid has a side chain that is negatively charged and hydrophilic at physiological pH.\n\nAssuming this mutation does not otherwise alter the alpha-helical propensity of the sequence, what is the most likely effect of this L-to-D mutation on the formation of the protein's homodimer at physiological pH?\n\nA. The mutation will destabilize the homodimer, making its formation less favorable.\n\nB. The mutation will stabilize the homodimer through the formation of new favorable electrostatic interactions.\n\nC. The mutation will have no significant effect on homodimer stability because it is only a single amino acid change.\n\nD. The mutation will cause the two protein chains to repel each other so strongly that they adopt an unfolded conformation.\n\nE. The mutation will lead to the formation of a more stable homotetramer (a complex of four identical chains) instead of a homodimer.", "solution": "The leucine zipper adopts a coiled-coil with a heptad repeat $(abcdefg)_{n}$ in which residues at the $a$ and $d$ positions form a hydrophobic stripe that packs at the dimer interface via the hydrophobic effect and van der Waals interactions. A leucine at a $d$ position contributes favorable burial of nonpolar surface and tight knob-into-hole packing.\n\nReplacing this leucine with aspartic acid at a $d$ position introduces a side chain that is negatively charged at physiological pH. In the coiled-coil core, the environment is largely nonpolar. Burying a charged group without a complementary countercharge incurs a large desolvation penalty and electrostatic self-energy cost, and also disrupts hydrophobic packing. These effects increase the standard free energy of dimerization.\n\nLet the wild-type dimerization equilibrium be $2\\text{M} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{D}$ with equilibrium constant $K_{\\text{wt}} = [\\text{D}]/[\\text{M}]^{2}$ and standard free energy $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{wt}} = -RT \\ln K_{\\text{wt}}$. For the mutant, introducing the buried charge yields an unfavorable contribution $\\Delta \\Delta G > 0$, so\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{mut}} = \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{wt}} + \\Delta \\Delta G,\n$$\nand therefore\n$$\nK_{\\text{mut}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{mut}}}{RT}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{wt}} + \\Delta \\Delta G}{RT}\\right) = K_{\\text{wt}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta \\Delta G}{RT}\\right)  K_{\\text{wt}}.\n$$\nThus, homodimer formation is less favorable.\n\nOption B would require a complementary positive charge at the interface to form a buried salt bridge; the partner residue remains leucine, so no such stabilization is available, and buried salt bridges are not generally stabilizing without precise complementarity. Option C is incorrect because a single substitution at a core interface position can have large effects on stability. Option D overstates the effect: the mutation is not expected to globally unfold the helices given unchanged helical propensity. Option E is not supported, as introducing a charged residue at the hydrophobic interface disfavors oligomerization rather than promoting a higher-order homotetramer.\n\nTherefore, the most likely effect is destabilization of the homodimer, making its formation less favorable.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2105840"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative prediction to quantitative design, this problem introduces a simplified computational model for protein engineering.
