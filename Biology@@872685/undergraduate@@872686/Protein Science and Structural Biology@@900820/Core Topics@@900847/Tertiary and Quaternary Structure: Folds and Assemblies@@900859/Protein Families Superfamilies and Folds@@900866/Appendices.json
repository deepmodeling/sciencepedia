Tools like the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) are indispensable, but their output is statistical, not deterministic.

Mastering this concept is critical for distinguishing a meaningful evolutionary signal from statistical noise when inferring homology.

To investigate a potential evolutionary relationship, a sequence alignment is performed using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm. The search compares the amino acid sequence of Protein Alpha against the sequence of Protein Beta. The result of this alignment yields an Expect-value (E-value) of 15. The E-value in this context represents the number of alignments with the observed level of similarity that would be expected to occur by random chance. A lower E-value indicates a more statistically significant alignment.\n\nBased solely on this E-value, select the most appropriate conclusion regarding the relationship between Protein Alpha and Protein Beta.\n\nA. Protein Alpha and Protein Beta are almost certainly members of the same protein family.\n\nB.

By definition, the E-value, denoted $E$, is the expected number of alignments with a score at least as high as the observed score that would occur by random chance under a suitable null model of unrelated sequences. Under the Karlin–Altschul statistics for local alignments, the expected count of random hits with score at least $S$ scales as\n$$\nE = K m n \\exp(-\\lambda S),\n$$\nwhere $m$ and $n$ are the effective lengths of the query and database (or target) sequences, $\\lambda$ and $K$ are positive parameters determined by the scoring system and background frequencies, and $S$ is the raw alignment score. Equivalently, the number of such random hits can be modeled as a Poisson random variable with mean $E$, so the probability of observing at least one random hit at that score or higher is\n$$\nP(\\text{at least one random hit}) = 1 - \\exp(-E).\n$$\nSignificance for homology inference typically requires $E \\le \\alpha$ for a small threshold $\\alpha$ with $\\alpha \\ll 1$, so that $1 - \\exp(-E) \\approx E$ is also $\\ll 1$ and the null hypothesis of random similarity is unlikely.\n\nIn the present case, the reported E-value is $E=15$. Since $E \\gg 1$, the Poisson model implies\n$$\nP(\\text{at least one random hit}) = 1 - \\exp(-E) \\approx 1,\n$$\nwhich indicates that alignments of the observed similarity level are expected to occur frequently by chance alone. Therefore, the alignment is not statistically significant, and one cannot infer homology or membership in the same family or superfamily based on this sequence similarity.\n\nEvaluating the options under this interpretation:\n- Option A claims strong homology at the family level, which is not supported because $E \\gg 1$.\n- Option B suggests superfamily-level relatedness, which also requires statistical support not present at $E \\gg 1$.\n- Option C states that it is highly improbable that they are members of the same family based on sequence similarity alone, which correctly reflects the lack of statistical significance when $E$ is large.\n- Option D asserts the absence of any evolutionary relationship, which is too strong; lack of sequence-level significance does not rule out remote homology undetectable by BLAST or detectable via structure.\n- Option E asserts structural fold identity, which cannot be concluded from a non-significant alignment.\n\nThus, based solely on the given E-value, the most appropriate conclusion is Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2127737"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply identifying homologs, it is crucial to understand their specific evolutionary history as either orthologs or paralogs. These different evolutionary paths impose distinct selective pressures, which in turn affect the rate of structural change over time. This practice challenges you to connect evolutionary theory to structural biology by predicting which type of homolog is likely to be more structurally conserved, a relationship quantified by metrics like the Root Mean Square Deviation ($RMSD$). [@problem_id:2127768]", "problem": "In evolutionary and structural biology, homologous proteins are compared to understand their functional and evolutionary relationships. Homologs are classified as either orthologs or paralogs. Orthologs are homologous proteins found in different species that arose from a single ancestral gene in the last common ancestor; this divergence occurs due to a speciation event. Orthologs typically retain the same biological function. Paralogs are homologous proteins within the same species that arose from a gene duplication event; following duplication, one copy is often free to diverge and acquire a new, though often related, function.\n\nThe structural similarity between two proteins can be quantified using the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), which measures the average distance between the atoms (usually the backbone atoms) of superimposed protein structures. A lower RMSD value indicates a greater degree of structural similarity.\n\nConsider three proteins:\n- Protein X, found in Species Alpha.\n- Protein Y, found in Species Beta.\n- Protein Z, also found in Species Alpha.\n\nProtein X and Protein Y are orthologs. Protein X and Protein Z are paralogs.\n\nBased on the theoretical principles of molecular evolution, which pair of proteins would you generally expect to be more structurally similar (i.e., have a lower RMSD), and what is the primary evolutionary reason for this expectation?\n\nA. The orthologs (X and Y), because speciation events are inherently less disruptive to protein structure than gene duplication events.\n\nB. The paralogs (X and Z), because they exist within the identical cellular environment and regulatory network of Species Alpha.\n\nC. The orthologs (X and Y), because they are generally under strong selective pressure to conserve an ancestral function across different species.\n\nD. The paralogs (X and Z), because their shared evolutionary history within a single species lineage leads to greater structural conservation.\n\nE. Both pairs are expected to have a similar RMSD, as the rate of structural evolution is constant and independent of the type of homology.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the definitions and evolutionary expectations regarding orthologs and paralogs. Orthologs are homologous genes in different species that diverged due to a speciation event; they typically retain the ancestral function and therefore experience strong purifying selection to conserve that function across species. Paralogs are homologous genes within the same species that arose from gene duplication; following duplication, one copy often experiences relaxed constraint and may undergo subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization, which can be accompanied by changes in sequence, active-site geometry, and even overall structure.\n\nStructural similarity between proteins is commonly quantified by RMSD after structural superposition; a lower RMSD indicates greater structural similarity. Under purifying selection to maintain the same biochemical function, structural features critical to that function (including the overall fold and key local geometries) tend to be conserved, leading to lower RMSD. Conversely, when one paralog is freed from the full ancestral functional constraints after duplication, it may adapt to a modified or new function, which can be reflected in greater structural divergence and thus a higher RMSD on average.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because a speciation event is not inherently less “disruptive” to protein structure than a duplication event; rather, the selective regime after the event governs structural conservation. Orthologs tend to retain function under purifying selection, not because the speciation event itself preserves structure.\n- Option B is incorrect because sharing the same cellular environment does not guarantee stronger structural conservation; paralogs often diverge functionally due to relaxed or shifted selective pressures after duplication.\n- Option C is correct: orthologs (X and Y) are generally expected to be more structurally similar (lower RMSD) because they are under strong selective pressure to conserve the ancestral function across species, which constrains structural evolution.\n- Option D is incorrect because sharing an ancestral lineage within a species does not imply stronger conservation; duplication specifically enables divergence in one copy.\n- Option E is incorrect because the rate of structural evolution is not constant and depends on functional constraints and selection; paralogs often experience altered constraints compared to orthologs.\n\nTherefore, the expected more structurally similar pair is the orthologs, and the primary evolutionary reason is the stronger purifying selection to conserve ancestral function across species.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2127768"}, {"introduction": "In the era of AI-driven structure prediction, we often possess a high-quality 3D model for a protein whose sequence shows no obvious relationship to known families.

PSI-BLAST builds a position-specific scoring matrix iteratively, increasing sensitivity to remote homologs compared to standard BLAST. This is a logical next step after no hits with standard BLAST.\n- B: Submitting the 3D coordinates to structural alignment servers such as DALI or Foldseek is directly aligned with structure-based classification, identifying structural neighbors in the PDB that are often already mapped to CATH/SCOP.\n- C: Concluding a new fold purely because BLAST failed is inappropriate and illogical; many remote homologs evade standard BLAST yet share established folds detectable by profile or structure-based methods.\n- D: Discarding a high-confidence AI model is not justified. While threading can be used as complementary evidence, the option explicitly instructs to discard the existing model, which is not a sound step in a standard workflow given a high-confidence structure.\n- E: Calculating isoelectric point and molecular weight and searching by these properties does not aid fold/superfamily classification; these features are not fold-specific and are not used by CATH/SCOP.\n- F: Visual inspection of secondary structure arrangement and topology using molecular graphics is a standard and valuable step to verify and interpret automated structural matches and to map to CATH/SCOP architectural and topological terms.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate and logical actions are A, B, and F.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABF}$$", "id": "2127725"}]}
