This practice problem guides you to identify the dominant stabilizing interaction in a homo-tetramer by observing the effect of a single amino acid substitution at the subunit interface. This exercise hones your ability to connect molecular properties to macroscopic behavior, a crucial skill for interpreting experimental data in structural biology. [@problem_id:2113576]", "problem": "A hypothetical protein, called Quartzin, naturally assembles into a stable homo-tetramer, which is a complex formed by four identical protein subunits. Biophysical analysis reveals that the interfaces where these subunits contact each other are predominantly lined with non-polar amino acid residues. A scientist uses site-directed mutagenesis to create a mutant version of Quartzin. In this mutant, a single leucine residue, located at the very center of a subunit-subunit interface, is replaced with an aspartate residue. When this mutant protein is placed in a buffered aqueous solution at physiological pH, it fails to form the tetramer and exists solely as monomers.\n\nBased on this experimental observation, which of the following is the most significant stabilizing interaction responsible for the assembly of the wild-type Quartzin homo-tetramer?\n\nA. Covalent disulfide bonds formed between cysteine residues on adjacent subunits.\n\nB. A network of salt bridges involving electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged residues at the interface.\n\nC. The hydrophobic effect, which drives the association of non-polar surfaces to minimize their contact with water.\n\nD. An extensive array of hydrogen bonds between polar, uncharged residues at the interface.\n\nE. Coordination of a divalent metal cation that bridges the subunits.", "solution": "We are told the wild-type homo-tetramer interface is predominantly non-polar and that replacing a central leucine (hydrophobic, uncharged) with an aspartate (charged, polar at physiological pH due to deprotonated side chain carboxylate) abolishes tetramerization in aqueous buffer at physiological pH. The key physical principle is the hydrophobic effect: non-polar surfaces tend to associate to minimize exposure to water, reducing the ordering of surrounding water and lowering the free energy. Burial of non-polar side chains at a protein–protein interface is stabilized largely by this effect and by van der Waals packing.\n\nIntroducing a charged residue (aspartate) at the center of a hydrophobic interface imposes a large desolvation penalty and creates an unfavorable energetic environment for a charged group in a non-polar context, thereby destabilizing the interface and preventing oligomerization. This specific sensitivity to replacing a hydrophobic residue with a charged residue at the interface strongly implicates hydrophobic interactions as the dominant stabilizing force.\n\nWe evaluate the options:\n- A: Disulfide bonds are covalent and would not be disrupted by a single Leu to Asp substitution unless cysteines were directly involved. The description emphasizes non-polar interfaces rather than cysteine-mediated covalent crosslinks, so this is inconsistent.\n- B: Salt bridges require complementary charged residues; a non-polar interface argues against a dense network of salt bridges. Moreover, introducing a negatively charged aspartate could, in principle, create rather than abolish a salt bridge if positives were present; the observed disruption argues the interface was not stabilized primarily by salt bridges.\n- C: The hydrophobic effect matches both observations: a non-polar interface and disruption upon introducing a polar/charged residue centrally.\n- D: Hydrogen bond networks would suggest many polar, uncharged residues at the interface, which contradicts the stated predominance of non-polar residues.\n- E: Metal coordination typically involves residues such as His, Asp, or Glu; a predominantly non-polar interface and a central leucine are inconsistent with metal-mediated assembly. Introducing Asp would more likely create a potential metal-binding site rather than eliminate an existing one.\n\nTherefore, the most significant stabilizing interaction is the hydrophobic effect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2113576"}, {"introduction": "Once we understand the forces holding oligomers together, we can explore the consequences of mixing different types of subunits. This thought experiment asks you to predict the variety of dimeric proteins that form when two distinct subunits, a wild-type and a mutant, are allowed to randomly associate. This practice is key to understanding the formation of hetero-oligomers and provides a basis for interpreting data from biochemical separation techniques.

This problem presents a classic case of interallelic complementation, where two different inactive mutant subunits combine to restore enzymatic activity. Solving this puzzle reveals how interactions within a hetero-oligomer can rescue function, showcasing the elegance and robustness of biological systems. [@problem_id:2113523]", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment, a research team is studying a fictional enzyme called \"Colorase,\" which functions as a stable homodimer. Each subunit of Colorase consists of two distinct functional domains: a Dimerization Domain (DD) required for the two subunits to bind to each other, and a Catalytic Domain (CD) that performs the chemical reaction. The functional enzyme converts a colorless substrate into a bright red product.\n\nThe researchers have two mutant strains of cells.\n- **Strain 1** expresses a mutant version of Colorase called C-alpha. The C-alpha protein has a point mutation in its Catalytic Domain, rendering it completely inactive. However, its Dimerization Domain is perfectly functional. Cells from Strain 1 do not produce any red color.\n- **Strain 2** expresses a different mutant version of Colorase called C-beta. The C-beta protein has a point mutation in its Dimerization Domain that prevents it from forming stable dimers. Its Catalytic Domain, however, is structurally and functionally intact. Cells from Strain 2 also do not produce any red color.\n\nWhen the genes for C-alpha and C-beta are co-expressed in a new host cell, the cells are observed to produce the red product, indicating that functional Colorase activity has been partially restored. Which of the following statements provides the most plausible molecular explanation for this phenomenon?\n\nA. The C-alpha subunit acts as a molecular chaperone, helping the C-beta subunit to fold correctly and form functional C-beta homodimers.\n\nB. Spontaneous mutations in the co-expressing cells frequently revert either the C-alpha or C-beta gene back to the wild-type sequence, producing functional wild-type enzymes.\n\nC. A heterodimer forms between one C-alpha subunit and one C-beta subunit. In this complex, the functional Dimerization Domain from C-alpha stabilizes the dimer, allowing the functional Catalytic Domain from C-beta to be active.\n\nD. The C-alpha protein binds to an allosteric site on the C-beta protein, inducing a conformational change that activates C-beta's catalytic function without requiring dimerization.\n\nE. Through a process of gene conversion, the DNA sequence of the functional domain from one gene is used as a template to repair the mutated domain in the other gene, leading to the synthesis of wild-type protein.", "solution": "The wild-type enzyme is a stable homodimer, so functional activity requires two conditions: dimer formation via the Dimerization Domain (DD) and catalytic competence via the Catalytic Domain (CD). Strain 1 produces C-alpha with an inactive CD but functional DD; C-alpha can dimerize but cannot catalyze, so no product forms. Strain 2 produces C-beta with a defective DD but intact CD; C-beta cannot form the required dimer, so its catalytic activity is not realized, and no product forms.\n\nWhen both proteins are co-expressed, the observation of red product implies that some complexes satisfy both requirements: dimerization and at least one functional CD. A plausible mechanism is interallelic (domain) complementation via a heterodimer composed of one C-alpha and one C-beta subunit, where the intact DD of C-alpha stabilizes the dimeric complex sufficiently for the intact CD of C-beta to perform catalysis. This would yield partial restoration, consistent with the observation, because only one of the two CDs in the heterodimer is active.\n\nOption-by-option evaluation:\n- A is implausible because C-beta’s defect is in dimerization, not folding, and forming C-beta homodimers would still require a functional DD in both subunits.\n- B is unlikely because frequent spontaneous reversion restoring wild-type function is not a plausible routine explanation and would not predict consistent partial (rather than full) restoration.\n- C directly describes heterodimerization-mediated complementation: C-alpha contributes dimerization, C-beta contributes catalysis, matching the observed partial rescue.\n- D contradicts the requirement that the enzyme functions as a dimer; merely allosteric activation without dimerization would not restore activity if dimerization is essential.\n- E (gene conversion) is an infrequent genomic event and would more likely restore wild-type levels rather than partial activity; it is not the most plausible immediate mechanistic explanation.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation is the formation of a C-alpha/C-beta heterodimer with functional dimerization provided by C-alpha and catalysis by C-beta.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2113523"}]}
