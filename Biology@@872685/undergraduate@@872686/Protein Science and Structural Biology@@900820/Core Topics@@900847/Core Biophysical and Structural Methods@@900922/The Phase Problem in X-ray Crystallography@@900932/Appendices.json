This first exercise breaks down the composition of a Patterson map in a simplified scenario, helping you visualize how it is built from vectors within a single molecule (self-Patterson) and vectors between different molecules (cross-Patterson). Understanding this fundamental principle is the first step toward interpreting the complex maps used in real structure solutions [@problem_id:2145243].", "problem": "In the field of X-ray crystallography, a Patterson map provides crucial information for solving the phase problem, especially when dealing with structures containing heavy atoms or known molecular fragments. A Patterson map is calculated from the experimentally measured diffraction intensities and its peaks correspond to the set of all interatomic vectors within the crystal's unit cell.\n\nConsider a hypothetical homodimeric protein, Dimerin, which crystallizes in the space group P1 (i.e., with no symmetry operations other than lattice translations) in an orthorhombic unit cell with dimensions $a, b, c$. Each unit cell contains exactly one Dimerin molecule. The two identical monomers that form the dimer, M1 and M2, are related to each other by a single, pure translation vector $\\vec{T} = (\\frac{a}{2}, 0, 0)$.\n\nLet the complete set of non-zero, intra-monomer vectors (i.e., vectors from one atom to another atom within the same monomer) be denoted by the set $\\mathcal{V}_{intra}$. These vectors, along with their centrosymmetric counterparts, define the \"self-Patterson\" of a single monomer. Based on this information, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected pattern of non-origin peaks in the native Patterson map computed from the Dimerin crystal?\n\nA. The non-origin peaks are found only at positions corresponding to the vectors in $\\mathcal{V}_{intra}$ and their inverses.\n\nB. The map contains two clusters of peaks: one centered at the vector position $\\vec{T}$ and an identical, inverted cluster centered at $-\\vec{T}$.\n\nC. The only non-origin peaks are a single strong peak at the position $\\vec{T}$ and its centrosymmetric partner at $-\\vec{T}$.\n\nD. The non-origin peaks are distributed in three main clusters. One cluster is centered at the origin $(0,0,0)$ and corresponds to vectors in $\\mathcal{V}_{intra}$. A second, identical cluster is centered at $\\vec{T}$. A third, centrosymmetrically-related cluster is centered at $-\\vec{T}$.\n\nE. The Patterson map is completely uniform except for the origin peak, because the translational relationship between the monomers causes all interatomic vector contributions to destructively interfere.", "solution": "The Patterson function, $P(\\vec{u})$, gives the distribution of interatomic vectors within the unit cell. It can be defined as the auto-correlation of the electron density, $\\rho(\\vec{r})$:\n$$P(\\vec{u}) = \\int_{\\text{unit cell}} \\rho(\\vec{r}) \\rho(\\vec{r}+\\vec{u}) d\\vec{r}$$\nA peak at a position $\\vec{u}$ in the Patterson map indicates that there is a pair of atoms in the unit cell separated by the vector $\\vec{u}$.\n\nIn this problem, the total electron density in the unit cell, $\\rho_{cell}(\\vec{r})$, is the sum of the electron densities of the two monomers, M1 and M2. Let's denote the electron density of monomer M1 as $\\rho_1(\\vec{r})$. Since monomer M2 is a translated copy of M1 by the vector $\\vec{T}$, its electron density, $\\rho_2(\\vec{r})$, can be written in terms of $\\rho_1(\\vec{r})$:\n$$\\rho_2(\\vec{r}) = \\rho_1(\\vec{r}-\\vec{T})$$\nThe total electron density is:\n$$\\rho_{cell}(\\vec{r}) = \\rho_1(\\vec{r}) + \\rho_2(\\vec{r}) = \\rho_1(\\vec{r}) + \\rho_1(\\vec{r}-\\vec{T})$$\n\nThe Patterson function is the auto-correlation (or, equivalently, the convolution with the inverted function) of the total electron density:\n$$P(\\vec{u}) = \\rho_{cell}(\\vec{r}) * \\rho_{cell}(-\\vec{r})$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\rho_{cell}(\\vec{r})$:\n$$P(\\vec{u}) = [\\rho_1(\\vec{r}) + \\rho_2(\\vec{r})] * [\\rho_1(-\\vec{r}) + \\rho_2(-\\vec{r})]$$\nUsing the distributive property of convolution, we can expand this into four terms:\n$$P(\\vec{u}) = [\\rho_1(\\vec{r}) * \\rho_1(-\\vec{r})] + [\\rho_2(\\vec{r}) * \\rho_2(-\\vec{r})] + [\\rho_1(\\vec{r}) * \\rho_2(-\\vec{r})] + [\\rho_2(\\vec{r}) * \\rho_1(-\\vec{r})]$$\n\nLet's analyze each term:\n\n1.  **Term 1: $\\rho_1(\\vec{r}) * \\rho_1(-\\vec{r})$**\n    This is the auto-correlation of monomer M1 with itself. The peaks of this function correspond to all the intra-monomer vectors within M1. This set of vectors is exactly what the problem defines as the \"self-Patterson\" of the monomer, which includes the vectors in $\\mathcal{V}_{intra}$ and their inverses. This cluster of peaks is centered at the origin $\\vec{u}=(0,0,0)$ of the Patterson map.\n\n2.  **Term 2: $\\rho_2(\\vec{r}) * \\rho_2(-\\vec{r})$**\n    This is the auto-correlation of monomer M2 with itself. Since M2 is identical to M1, this term produces the exact same set of peaks as Term 1, also centered at the origin. Therefore, the peaks corresponding to intra-monomer vectors are superimposed and strengthened.\n\n3.  **Term 3: $\\rho_1(\\vec{r}) * \\rho_2(-\\vec{r})$**\n    This \"cross-Patterson\" term corresponds to vectors pointing from an atom in M2 to an atom in M1. Let $\\vec{r}_j$ be the position of an atom in M1 and $\\vec{r}_k$ be the position of an atom in M2. The corresponding Patterson peak is at $\\vec{u} = \\vec{r}_j - \\vec{r}_k$. Since M2 is a translated copy of M1, we can write $\\vec{r}_k = \\vec{r}_{k'} + \\vec{T}$, where $\\vec{r}_{k'}$ is the position of the equivalent atom in M1.\n    Substituting this, we get $\\vec{u} = \\vec{r}_j - (\\vec{r}_{k'} + \\vec{T}) = (\\vec{r}_j - \\vec{r}_{k'}) - \\vec{T}$.\n    The term $(\\vec{r}_j - \\vec{r}_{k'})$ represents an intra-monomer vector (a vector within the reference frame of M1). The set of all such vectors is the self-Patterson of the monomer. Therefore, this entire collection of cross-vectors is the set of all intra-monomer vectors shifted by $-\\vec{T}$. This forms a cluster of peaks identical to the self-Patterson, but centered at $\\vec{u}=-\\vec{T}$.\n\n4.  **Term 4: $\\rho_2(\\vec{r}) * \\rho_1(-\\vec{r})$**\n    This cross-Patterson term corresponds to vectors pointing from an atom in M1 to an atom in M2. Let $\\vec{r}_j$ be in M2 and $\\vec{r}_k$ be in M1. A peak is at $\\vec{u} = \\vec{r}_j - \\vec{r}_k$.\n    We can write $\\vec{r}_j = \\vec{r}_{j'} + \\vec{T}$, where $\\vec{r}_{j'}$ is the equivalent atom in M1.\n    Substituting this gives $\\vec{u} = (\\vec{r}_{j'} + \\vec{T}) - \\vec{r}_k = (\\vec{r}_{j'} - \\vec{r}_k) + \\vec{T}$.\n    Similar to the previous case, the term $(\\vec{r}_{j'} - \\vec{r}_k)$ represents an intra-monomer vector. The full set of these cross-vectors is the set of all intra-monomer vectors shifted by $+\\vec{T}$. This forms another cluster of peaks identical to the self-Patterson, but centered at $\\vec{u}=+\\vec{T}$.\n\n**Summary of Peak Locations:**\n-   **Intra-monomer vectors (Terms 1  2):** A cluster of peaks corresponding to the monomer self-Patterson ($\\mathcal{V}_{intra}$ and its inverse), centered at the origin $(0,0,0)$.\n-   **Inter-monomer vectors M1 $\\rightarrow$ M2 (Term 4):** A copy of the monomer self-Patterson, where the entire cluster is shifted to be centered at $\\vec{T} = (\\frac{a}{2}, 0, 0)$. These are often called Harker peaks in cases with crystallographic symmetry, but here they arise from non-crystallographic symmetry.\n-   **Inter-monomer vectors M2 $\\rightarrow$ M1 (Term 3):** A copy of the monomer self-Patterson, where the entire cluster is shifted to be centered at $-\\vec{T} = (-\\frac{a}{2}, 0, 0)$.\n\nThus, the Patterson map contains three distinct clusters of peaks, all exhibiting the same internal pattern of the monomer's self-Patterson. One is at the origin, one at $\\vec{T}$, and one at $-\\vec{T}$.\n\nComparing this to the options:\n-   A is incorrect as it ignores the inter-monomer (cross-Patterson) vectors.\n-   B is incorrect as it ignores the intra-monomer (self-Patterson) vectors centered at the origin.\n-   C is incorrect as it falsely simplifies the cross-Patterson to a single peak. The cross-Patterson is a whole set of peaks.\n-   D correctly describes the three clusters: the self-Patterson at the origin, and two cross-Patterson clusters shifted by $\\vec{T}$ and $-\\vec{T}$. A Patterson map is always centrosymmetric, so the cluster at $-\\vec{T}$ is centrosymmetrically related to the one at $\\vec{T}$. Since the monomer self-Patterson is itself centrosymmetric, all three clusters of peaks are actually identical.\n-   E is incorrect; the vectors add constructively to form distinct features.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the most accurate description.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2145243"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic principles of the Patterson map, this next practice delves into its most critical application in experimental phasing: locating heavy atoms.

One common method to solve this is Single Isomorphous Replacement (SIR), where heavy atoms are introduced into the protein crystal. The positions of these heavy atoms can be determined by analyzing a \"difference Patterson map,\" which is a map of vectors between the heavy atoms in the crystal's unit cell.\n\nA biochemist has successfully crystallized a novel enzyme. The crystals are found to belong to the monoclinic space group $P2_1$. The symmetry operation for this space group relates an atom at fractional coordinates $(x, y, z)$ to a symmetry-equivalent atom at $(-x, y + 1/2, -z)$ within the unit cell. To solve the structure, a heavy-atom derivative is prepared by soaking the crystal in a solution containing mercury. After collecting diffraction data from both the native and derivative crystals, a difference Patterson map, denoted as $P(u, v, w)$, is calculated. The analysis focuses on a specific two-dimensional plane within the three-dimensional Patterson map known as a Harker section.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct physical reason for specifically analyzing the Harker section at $v=1/2$ to locate the position of the single mercury atom?\n\nA. This section directly reveals the electron density of the mercury atom at its coordinates $(x_H, y_H, z_H)$, where the screw axis forces its $y_H$ coordinate to be $1/2$.\n\nB. The peaks in this section correspond to vectors of the form $(0, 1/2, 2z_H)$ which directly reveal the $z$-coordinate of the mercury atom.\n\nC. This section contains Patterson peaks corresponding to vectors between symmetry-related mercury atoms, and the coordinates of these peaks are of the form $(2x_H, 1/2, 2z_H)$, allowing for the determination of the mercury atom's $x_H$ and $z_H$ coordinates.\n\nD. The Patterson function is a convolution of the electron density with itself, and for a screw axis, this convolution simplifies to reveal the original atom's coordinates $(x_H, y_H, z_H)$ only on the $v=1/2$ plane.\n\nE. This section contains Patterson peaks of the form $(2x_H, 2y_H, 1/2)$, which allows for the determination of the $x_H$ and $y_H$ coordinates of the mercury atom.", "solution": "The Patterson function in fractional coordinates, including the difference Patterson for isomorphous derivatives, is defined as the autocorrelation of the electron density, so that peaks occur at vectors between pairs of atoms.

This is precisely the rationale stated in option C. Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect because the Patterson map does not directly give original atomic coordinates, the $v$ coordinate is fixed at $1/2$ (not $2y_H$), and $u$ and $w$ are not generally zero unless the atom lies on special positions, which is not assumed here.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2145261"}, {"introduction": "While experimental phasing relies on interpreting Patterson maps, the most common method for solving the phase problem today is Molecular Replacement (MR), provided a homologous structure is known. This practice shifts our focus from interpreting raw vector maps to strategic problem-solving in an MR context. You are presented with a common but frustrating scenario: a seemingly straightforward MR calculation fails [@problem_id:2145254]. Success requires thinking beyond simple homology and considering how the protein's quaternary structure and the contents of the asymmetric unit can critically impact the success of the search.", "problem": "In the field of protein X-ray crystallography, the phase problem is a central challenge that is often overcome using a technique called Molecular Replacement (MR). MR works by using a known, homologous protein structure as a \"search model\" to determine the orientation and position of the unknown protein in its crystal lattice.\n\nImagine a scenario where you have successfully crystallized a protein that is known to function as a stable tetramer (a complex of four identical subunits). You have access to a high-resolution crystal structure of a single subunit (a monomer) from a closely related species, which you decide to use as your search model for MR. After running the MR protocol, the software fails to find a convincing solution.\n\nThe crystallographic asymmetric unit is the smallest part of the crystal's unit cell that, when operated on by the crystal's symmetry elements, reproduces the entire unit cell. The tetrameric protein possesses its own internal symmetry relating the four monomers, which is not part of the crystal's overall symmetry; this is known as Non-Crystallographic Symmetry (NCS).\n\nAssuming the monomer search model is of good quality and truly homologous to the protein subunits in your crystal, which of the following statements provides the most likely reason, specifically related to the protein's assembly and NCS, for the failure of the molecular replacement search?\n\nA. The asymmetric unit contains multiple copies of the monomer (e.g., the entire tetramer), so the search model accounts for only a fraction of the scattering matter, leading to a low signal-to-noise ratio in the search.\n\nB. The Non-Crystallographic Symmetry operators are identical to the crystallographic symmetry operators, causing destructive interference that eliminates the signal.\n\nC. The tetrameric assembly forces the individual subunits into a conformation that is too different from the monomeric search model, even if they are homologous.\n\nD. The rotation function, a key step in MR, is fundamentally unable to find orientations for molecules that are part of a symmetric assembly.\n\nE. The presence of four subunits in the tetramer means the volume of the search model is exactly one-quarter of the target, an integer relationship that causes systematic errors in the translation search algorithm.", "solution": "We identify the relevant principles of molecular replacement (MR) and non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS):\n- MR signal strength in both rotation and translation functions scales with how much of the true scattering the search model accounts for. If the search model represents only a fraction of the asymmetric unit content, the signal-to-noise ratio is reduced.\n- NCS implies multiple copies of a related subunit in the asymmetric unit that are related by non-crystallographic operators. Strong NCS produces strong self-rotation peaks and can complicate or dilute the signal when searching with only a single subunit.\n- Using a monomer to search for an oligomer that occupies the asymmetric unit is common, but when the asymmetric unit contains several copies (e.g., the entire tetramer), a single monomer accounts for only a fraction of the diffracting matter, potentially weakening both rotation and translation functions.\n\nEvaluate each option against these principles and the stated assumptions:\n\nA. If the asymmetric unit contains the entire tetramer and the search model is a monomer, the model represents only a fraction, typically $\\frac{1}{4}$, of the scattering content. MR signal strength approximately scales with this fraction; thus, the correlation peaks in rotation/translation functions can be weak. Moreover, strong NCS can produce multiple equivalent or ambiguous orientations for a monomer and reduce the distinctiveness of the correct solution. This provides a natural, NCS-related reason for MR failure with a monomeric model when the true content is a tetramer.\n\nB. By definition, NCS operators are not crystallographic. If the operators were identical to crystallographic symmetry, they would be crystallographic symmetry, not NCS. The idea of “destructive interference eliminating the signal” is not how MR failure occurs in this context. This is incorrect.\n\nC. Although oligomerization can induce conformational changes, the problem states the monomer search model is of good quality and truly homologous, making this a less likely failure mode. Moreover, this explanation is not specifically about NCS; it is about conformational mismatch, which the premise discourages.\n\nD. The rotation function is not fundamentally unable to find orientations for molecules in a symmetric assembly. In fact, symmetric assemblies often produce strong, interpretable self-rotation peaks. This is incorrect.\n\nE. There is no principle in MR stating that an exact integer relationship between model volume and target volume causes systematic errors in the translation function. This is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most likely reason specifically tied to assembly and NCS is that the asymmetric unit contains multiple copies (the tetramer), while the search model is only a monomer, causing the model to account for only a fraction (e.g., $\\frac{1}{4}$) of the scattering matter and thereby weakening the MR signal sufficiently to prevent a convincing solution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2145254"}]}
