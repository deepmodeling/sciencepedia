Their strategy is to create a potent competitive inhibitor for this enzyme. After synthesizing and testing numerous compounds, they have narrowed down the candidates to two promising molecules: Compound X1 and Compound Y2.\n\nThrough detailed kinetic analysis, the team determines the inhibition constant ($K_i$) for each compound. The $K_i$ for Compound X1 is found to be 40.0 nanomolar (nM). The $K_i$ for Compound Y2 is found to be 4.00 micromolar ($\\mu$M).\n\nBased on these inhibition constants, which of the following statements most accurately describes the relative potency of the two compounds as competitive inhibitors?\n\nA. Compound Y2 is 100 times more potent than Compound X1 because its $K_i$ value is numerically smaller.\n\nB. Compound X1 and Compound Y2 are equally potent because the Michaelis constant ($K_M$) of the enzyme is not provided.\n\nC. Compound X1 is 100 times more potent than Compound Y2.\n\nD.

Therefore, at fixed conditions, relative potency is inversely proportional to $K_{i}$.\n\nWrite the given $K_{i}$ values in common units:\n$$\nK_{i,\\text{X1}} = 40.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ M}, \\quad K_{i,\\text{Y2}} = 4.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ M}.\n$$\nCompute the relative potency as the inverse ratio of $K_{i}$ values:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{potency of X1}}{\\text{potency of Y2}} = \\frac{K_{i,\\text{Y2}}}{K_{i,\\text{X1}}} = \\frac{4.00 \\times 10^{-6}}{40.0 \\times 10^{-9}} = \\frac{4.00}{40.0} \\times 10^{3} = 100.\n$$\nThus, Compound X1 is $100$ times more potent than Compound Y2.
