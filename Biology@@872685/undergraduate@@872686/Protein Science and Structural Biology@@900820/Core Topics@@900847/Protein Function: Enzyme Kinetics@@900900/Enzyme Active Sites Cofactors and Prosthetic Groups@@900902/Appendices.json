The active site of substratase contains a key aspartate residue at position 95 (Asp-95). At physiological pH, this Asp-95 residue is known to form a crucial ionic bond with a positively charged region of the substrate S, thereby anchoring it in the correct orientation for catalysis. A researcher performs a site-directed mutagenesis experiment and creates a mutant version of substratase where Asp-95 is replaced by a lysine residue (Lys-95).\n\nAssume standard physiological pH for all enzyme activity assays. Let $K_M$ be the Michaelis constant and $k_{cat}$ be the turnover number for the reaction. Which of the following statements most accurately predicts the change in the kinetic parameters for the mutant enzyme compared to the wild-type enzyme?\n\nA. $K_M$ will increase, and $k_{cat}$ will decrease.\n\nB. $K_M$ will decrease, and $k_{cat}$ will increase.\n\nC. $K_M$ will increase, and $k_{cat}$ will remain relatively unchanged.\n\nD. $K_M$ will decrease, and $k_{cat}$ will decrease.\n\nE. $K_M$ will remain relatively unchanged, and $k_{cat}$ will decrease.", "solution": "Consider the standard Michaelis–Menten scheme:\n$$\nE + S \\xrightleftharpoons[k_{-1}]{k_{1}} ES \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{cat}}} E + P\n$$\nwith\n$$\nv=\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_{T}[S]}{K_{M}+[S]}, \\quad K_{M}=\\frac{k_{-1}+k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_{1}}.\n$$\nAt physiological pH, an aspartate side chain is deprotonated and negatively charged, whereas a lysine side chain is protonated and positively charged. In the wild-type enzyme, Asp-95 engages in a favorable ionic interaction with a positively charged region of the substrate, stabilizing the ES complex and orienting the substrate for catalysis. Replacing Asp-95 with Lys-95 removes this favorable electrostatic attraction and instead introduces an electrostatic repulsion with the same positively charged substrate region.\n\nConsequences for binding and thus for $K_{M}$:\n- Loss of the favorable ionic bond and introduction of repulsion will weaken ES binding. In kinetic terms, the association step becomes less favorable (effective decrease in $k_{1}$) and/or the ES complex becomes less stable (effective increase in $k_{-1}$).\n- From $K_{M}=(k_{-1}+k_{\\text{cat}})/k_{1}$, a decrease in $k_{1}$ and/or an increase in $k_{-1}$ increases $K_{M}$.\nTherefore, $K_{M}$ is expected to increase.\n\nConsequences for $k_{\\text{cat}}$:\n- The prompt specifies that the ionic bond at Asp-95 is “crucial” for anchoring the substrate in the correct orientation for catalysis. Loss of correct orientation typically slows the chemical step in the active site because properly aligned catalytic groups are required to lower the activation barrier. Thus, even if Asp-95 is not a direct acid/base or covalent catalyst, disrupting orientation commonly reduces $k_{\\text{cat}}$.\n- Introducing a positively charged Lys at that position may further distort the active site electrostatics, compounding misorientation and possibly destabilizing the transition state, which also tends to decrease $k_{\\text{cat}}$.\n\nPutting these effects together, the most accurate prediction is that $K_{M}$ will increase and $k_{\\text{cat}}$ will decrease.\n\nHence, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2110043"}, {"introduction": "While the protein scaffold provides the catalytic framework, many enzymes are inactive on their own and require non-protein components called cofactors to function.

Any potential removal of inhibitory contaminant metals by EDTA is outweighed by chelation of the essential $Zn^{2+}$, so the net effect is a rate decrease.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the rate decreases because EDTA chelates and removes the essential $Zn^{2+}$ cofactor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2110021"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of active site structure not only allows us to interpret enzyme function but also empowers us to modify it through protein engineering. This final problem challenges you to think like an enzyme designer, predicting how altering the size of an active site residue can fine-tune substrate specificity. This practice will deepen your appreciation for how physical principles like steric hindrance govern an enzyme's preference for one substrate over another, a concept quantified by the specificity constant, $k_{cat}/K_M$.

The active site of this enzyme contains a deep binding pocket perfectly contoured to fit the small malonate molecule (structure: HOOC-CH₂-COOH). At the base of this pocket lies a glycine residue, whose small size (side chain: -H) provides the necessary space for malonate to bind optimally.\n\nThe biochemist observes that the wild-type enzyme also exhibits a very low level of activity towards a larger, structurally similar molecule, ethylmalonate (structure: HOOC-CH(CH₂CH₃)-COOH). To investigate the structural basis of this specificity, a site-directed mutagenesis experiment is performed, replacing the glycine residue at the base of the pocket with a phenylalanine residue (side chain: a bulky, nonpolar benzyl group).\n\nThe catalytic efficiency of an enzyme for a particular substrate is quantified by the specificity constant, which is the ratio of the catalytic rate constant ($k_{cat}$) to the Michaelis constant ($K_M$). A higher specificity constant indicates a greater catalytic efficiency. The enzyme's preference for one substrate (A) over another (B) can be evaluated by comparing their respective specificity constants, i.e., by the ratio $((k_{cat}/K_M)_A) / ((k_{cat}/K_M)_B)$.\n\nBased on the principles of enzyme structure and function, how would this glycine-to-phenylalanine mutation most likely alter the enzyme's substrate preference?\n\nA. The enzyme’s preference for malonate over ethylmalonate will increase.\n\nB. The enzyme’s preference for ethylmalonate over malonate will increase.\n\nC. The mutation will decrease catalytic efficiency for both substrates to a similar degree, leaving the substrate preference largely unchanged.\n\nD. The enzyme will become completely inactive towards both substrates.\n\nE. The mutation will increase the catalytic efficiency for both substrates due to new hydrophobic interactions.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the effect of mutating a small glycine (Gly) residue to a bulky phenylalanine (Phe) residue in the substrate-binding pocket of Malonate Decarboxylase. We need to assess how this change affects the enzyme's preference for its small native substrate, malonate, versus a larger alternative substrate, ethylmalonate.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Wild-Type Enzyme:** The wild-type enzyme has a glycine at the base of its active site pocket. Glycine's side chain is just a hydrogen atom, making it the smallest amino acid. This creates a pocket with maximal space, perfectly accommodating the small malonate substrate. The larger ethylmalonate can also bind, but its bulkier ethyl group likely causes a suboptimal fit, resulting in a lower binding affinity (higher $K_M$) and/or a less efficient catalysis (lower $k_{cat}$) compared to malonate. Therefore, for the wild-type enzyme, the specificity constant for malonate, $(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{malonate}}$, is significantly higher than for ethylmalonate, $(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{ethylmalonate}}$. The enzyme strongly prefers malonate.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Mutation:** The mutation replaces glycine with phenylalanine. Phenylalanine has a large, rigid, and nonpolar benzyl side chain. This bulky group will now protrude into the space at the base of the active site pocket that was previously unoccupied. This is a classic example of introducing steric hindrance.\n\n3.  **Effect on Malonate (Small Substrate):** The binding of malonate will be affected by the new bulky phenylalanine. The pocket is now more crowded. While malonate is small and may still be able to bind, the fit will be less ideal than in the wild-type enzyme. This steric clash will likely decrease its binding affinity (increase its $K_M$) and could also distort the geometry required for the catalytic reaction, thus decreasing the catalytic rate (lower $k_{cat}$). The overall catalytic efficiency, $(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{malonate}}$, for the mutant enzyme is expected to decrease compared to the wild-type.\n\n4.  **Effect on Ethylmalonate (Large Substrate):** The binding of ethylmalonate, which was already a tight fit in the wild-type enzyme due to its ethyl group, will be much more severely affected. The large phenylalanine side chain will clash significantly with the ethyl group of the substrate. This severe steric hindrance will make it extremely difficult for ethylmalonate to enter and bind productively in the active site. This will cause a very large increase in its $K_M$ (dramatically reduced binding affinity) and likely a very large decrease in its $k_{cat}$, as correct positioning for catalysis will be nearly impossible. The reduction in the specificity constant, $(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{ethylmalonate}}$, will be much more drastic than the reduction seen for malonate.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Change in Preference:** We are interested in the ratio of the specificity constants, which represents substrate preference:\n    $$ \\text{Preference for Malonate} = \\frac{(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{malonate}}}{(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{ethylmalonate}}} $$\n    Let's compare this ratio for the wild-type (WT) and mutant (MUT) enzymes.\n    - For the WT, this ratio is large and positive, indicating a strong preference for malonate.\n    - For the MUT, the numerator, $(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{malonate}}$, decreases. However, the denominator, $(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{ethylmalonate}}$, decreases much more dramatically, possibly approaching zero.\n    When a fraction's numerator decreases slightly but its denominator decreases drastically, the value of the fraction as a whole increases.\n    $$ \\left( \\frac{(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{malonate}}}{(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{ethylmalonate}}} \\right)_{\\text{MUT}} > \\left( \\frac{(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{malonate}}}{(k_{cat}/K_M)_{\\text{ethylmalonate}}} \\right)_{\\text{WT}} $$\n    Therefore, the mutant enzyme's relative preference for malonate over ethylmalonate will increase. It becomes an even more selective (though less efficient overall) catalyst for the smaller substrate.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A. The enzyme’s preference for malonate over ethylmalonate will increase. This matches our reasoning. The enzyme's ability to process the larger substrate is almost eliminated, while its ability to process the smaller substrate is only moderately hindered, thus increasing the relative selectivity.\n    *   B. The enzyme’s preference for ethylmalonate over malonate will increase. This is incorrect. The bulky Phe group would clash with the ethyl group, not favor it.\n    *   C. The mutation will decrease catalytic efficiency for both substrates to a similar degree... This is incorrect because the steric effect is highly dependent on the size of the substrate. The larger substrate is affected disproportionately.\n    *   D. The enzyme will become completely inactive towards both substrates. This is too extreme. While the activity will decrease, complete inactivation from a single, non-catalytic residue mutation is not guaranteed, especially for the small native substrate.\n    *   E. The mutation will increase the catalytic efficiency for both substrates... This is incorrect. The introduction of steric bulk into a well-defined pocket is almost always detrimental to binding and catalysis for the original substrates.\n\nThe correct conclusion is that the mutation makes the enzyme more selective for the smaller substrate, malonate, by disproportionately penalizing the binding and turnover of the larger substrate, ethylmalonate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2110055"}]}
