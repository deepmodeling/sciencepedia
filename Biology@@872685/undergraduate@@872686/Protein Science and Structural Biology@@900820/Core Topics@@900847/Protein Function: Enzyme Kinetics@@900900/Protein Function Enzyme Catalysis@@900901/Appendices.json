The student conducts a series of experiments to measure the initial rate of reaction at a constant enzyme concentration but with varying concentrations of the substrate.

By strategically mutating specific amino acids in the active site, we can test hypotheses about their roles in the catalytic mechanism. This exercise puts you in the role of a molecular biologist, asking you to design the most informative experiment to test whether a specific residue acts as a general base in catalysis [@problem_id:2128315].", "problem": "A team of biochemists is studying a newly discovered enzyme, \"Hydrolysin,\" which catalyzes the cleavage of a specific peptide bond in a substrate protein. The established reaction mechanism involves a key step where a water molecule must be deprotonated to act as a nucleophile. Structural analysis of the active site suggests that the residue Aspartate-87 (D87) is positioned correctly to perform this function. The lead researcher hypothesizes that the carboxylate side chain of D87 acts as a general base, abstracting a proton from the water molecule to generate a reactive hydroxide ion.\n\nTo rigorously test this hypothesis using site-directed mutagenesis, the team plans to create a mutant version of Hydrolysin with a single amino acid substitution at position 87.

Aspartate’s carboxylate is deprotonated under physiological conditions and can serve as a general base. To test this role with minimal structural perturbation, the optimal mutation should eliminate the negative charge and proton-accepting capability while preserving side-chain size and hydrogen-bonding geometry as much as possible, so that any loss of activity specifically implicates the base function rather than gross structural disruption.\n\nEvaluate each substitution:\n- D87E: Glutamate preserves a negatively charged carboxylate and similar chemistry, only adding one methylene. It could still act as a general base; thus it is not informative for eliminating base catalysis.\n- D87K: Lysine introduces a long, positively charged amine that can itself participate in acid-base chemistry and substantially alters electrostatics and geometry, confounding interpretation.\n- D87N: Asparagine replaces the carboxylate with an isosteric, neutral carboxamide. It closely preserves size and hydrogen-bonding geometry but removes the negative charge and the ability to act as a general base at physiological pH (the amide is not deprotonatable under these conditions). This isolates the base function with minimal structural perturbation.\n- D87A: Alanine removes nearly the entire side chain, eliminating both charge and hydrogen-bonding capability and causing a cavity; this is a larger structural perturbation than necessary.\n- D87F: Phenylalanine introduces a bulky hydrophobic ring, drastically altering the local environment and sterics, making it unsuitable.\n\nTherefore, D87N is the most informative and appropriate substitution to test the general base hypothesis while minimizing structural disruption.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2128315"}]}
