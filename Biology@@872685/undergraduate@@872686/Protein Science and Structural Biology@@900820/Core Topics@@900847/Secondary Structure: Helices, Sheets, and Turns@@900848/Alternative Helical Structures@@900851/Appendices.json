The collagen triple helix, a structure vital for the integrity of our connective tissues, is a perfect illustration of this principle. This first practice challenges you to act like a structural bioinformatician, scanning a peptide sequence to identify the simple, repeating motif that is the unmistakable signature of a collagen-like structure [@problem_id:2098061].", "problem": "In structural biology, the primary sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is the fundamental determinant of its final three-dimensional conformation and function. The protein collagen, a major component of connective tissue in animals, possesses a distinctive triple helix structure. This unique quaternary structure is stabilized by a characteristic, highly repetitive motif within its primary sequence.\n\nImagine a biochemist is studying a synthetic peptide segment intended to self-assemble into a collagen-like fibril. The primary sequence of this peptide segment is given as:\n\nGlycine(G)-Proline(P)-Histidine(H)-Glycine(G)-Alanine(A)-Proline(P)-Glycine(G)-Leucine(L)-Methionine(M)\n\nBased on this sequence, identify the most general and consistently repeating tripeptide (three-amino-acid) motif that is characteristic of collagen and is present throughout this entire segment.\n\nA.

Pro-X-Gly, where X represents any amino acid.\n\nE. Gly-X-Gly, where X represents any amino acid.", "solution": "The solution to this problem involves identifying the repeating amino acid pattern in the given sequence that is characteristic of collagen's structure.\n\nFirst, let's state the foundational principle of collagen structure. The stability of the collagen triple helix requires a specific repeating tripeptide motif, which is Gly-X-Y. In this motif, Glycine (G) must occupy every third position. The 'X' and 'Y' positions can be filled by any amino acid, but are frequently occupied by Proline (P) and Hydroxyproline (a modified version of Proline), respectively. The requirement for Glycine at every third position is absolute because Glycine is the only amino acid with a side chain small enough (a single hydrogen atom) to fit into the sterically crowded center of the tightly packed triple helix. Any other amino acid at this position would disrupt the helical structure.\n\nNow, let's analyze the provided peptide sequence:\nG-P-H-G-A-P-G-L-M\n\nWe can examine the sequence for a repeating pattern of three amino acids. Let's list the amino acids by their position number:\n1: G (Glycine)\n2: P (Proline)\n3: H (Histidine)\n4: G (Glycine)\n5: A (Alanine)\n6: P (Proline)\n7: G (Glycine)\n8: L (Leucine)\n9: M (Methionine)\n\nWe observe that Glycine (G) appears at positions 1, 4, and 7. This is a consistent pattern where Glycine appears at every third residue ($1, 1+3, 1+2 \\times 3$). This strongly suggests that the repeating unit is a triplet that begins with Glycine.\n\nLet's break the sequence into triplets based on this observation:\n- Triplet 1: Positions 1-3 form `G-P-H`\n- Triplet 2: Positions 4-6 form `G-A-P`\n- Triplet 3: Positions 7-9 form `G-L-M`\n\nNow we can evaluate the given options:\n\nA. **Gly-Pro-X**: The first triplet is `G-P-H`, which fits this pattern (X = H). However, the second triplet is `G-A-P`. Here, the amino acid in the second position is Alanine (A), not Proline (P). Therefore, the `Gly-Pro-X` motif is not consistently found throughout the sequence.\n\nB. **Gly-X-Y**: Let's check this against our parsed triplets.\n- Triplet 1: `G-P-H`. This fits the pattern with X = P and Y = H.\n- Triplet 2: `G-A-P`. This fits the pattern with X = A and Y = P.\n- Triplet 3: `G-L-M`. This fits the pattern with X = L and Y = M.\nThis motif is consistent for every triplet in the sequence.\n\nC. **X-Pro-Gly**: This motif requires Glycine (G) to be at the end of each triplet (positions 3, 6, 9, etc.). In our sequence, Glycine is at positions 1, 4, and 7. This option is incorrect.\n\nD. **Pro-X-Gly**: This motif requires the triplet to start with Proline (P) and end with Glycine (G). This is inconsistent with the observed sequence where triplets start with Glycine. This option is incorrect.\n\nE. **Gly-X-Gly**: This motif requires Glycine to be at the first and third positions of each triplet. \n- Triplet 1 is `G-P-H`. The third position is Histidine (H), not Glycine (G).\nTherefore, this motif is not present.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only motif that is consistently repeated throughout the entire peptide segment is Gly-X-Y, where X and Y can be any amino acid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2098061"}, {"introduction": "Having learned to recognize the characteristic Gly-X-Y pattern of collagen [@problem_id:2098061], we now delve deeper into the \"why.\" Why is this sequence rule so absolute? This problem presents a hypothetical mutation, a common tool in biochemistry to probe structural principles, asking you to predict the outcome when the tiny glycine is replaced by a slightly larger alanine. Your reasoning will illuminate the severe steric constraints at the core of the triple helix and provide insight into the molecular basis of collagen-related diseases [@problem_id:2098019].", "problem": "Collagen, the most abundant protein in mammals, forms a characteristic triple helix structure crucial for its function in connective tissues. This structure is typically formed from three polypeptide chains, each consisting of a repeating amino acid sequence of the form Gly-X-Y, where X is often proline and Y is often hydroxyproline. In the assembled triple helix, the glycine residues from each of the three chains are directed towards the central axis of the helix, a space that is extremely sterically crowded.\n\nConsider a synthetic collagen-like peptide designed to form a stable triple helix under physiological conditions. A single point mutation is introduced into the gene encoding this peptide, causing one of the glycine residues located in the middle of the polypeptide chain to be substituted with an alanine residue. All other residues remain unchanged.\n\nBased on the principles of protein structure, what is the most likely consequence of this single Gly-to-Ala mutation on the triple helix assembly?\n\nA. The mutation will significantly stabilize the triple helix due to favorable hydrophobic interactions from the new alanine side chain.\n\nB. The mutation will have no significant effect on the structure, as alanine is also a small, nonpolar amino acid.\n\nC. The mutation will cause a local disruption or prevent the proper formation of the triple helix due to steric hindrance at the helical core.\n\nD. The mutation will alter the twist of the triple helix, changing it from a left-handed to a right-handed supercoil.\n\nE. The mutation will promote the formation of a more stable, alternative helical structure, such as an alpha-helix, within the affected chain.", "solution": "We begin from the structural principle that collagen triple helices require a repeating Gly-X-Y motif, with glycine at every third position. In the assembled triple helix, the three glycine residues from the three chains pack into the central core of the superhelix. This location is extremely sterically constrained because three backbones converge; only glycine, with a hydrogen as its side chain, can be accommodated without steric clashes.\n\nSubstituting glycine with alanine replaces the hydrogen side chain with a methyl group. Even though alanine is small and nonpolar, its methyl group is substantially larger than a hydrogen atom and introduces steric bulk at the core. This causes steric hindrance within the tightly packed central axis, perturbing interchain packing and the geometry required for interchain hydrogen bonding.\n\nFrom these principles, the most likely consequence of a Gly-to-Ala substitution at a core glycine position in collagen is a local disruption of the triple helix, often manifesting as delayed folding, local unwinding, kink formation, or complete prevention of proper triple-helix assembly at and around the mutation site. This destabilization is a well-established outcome of glycine substitutions in collagen and underlies various pathologies when occurring in vivo.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because adding a methyl group in the crowded core does not create favorable hydrophobic interactions; it creates steric clashes.\n- B is incorrect because, despite being small, alanine is not small enough for the collagen core; the difference between hydrogen and methyl is critical here.\n- C is correct because steric hindrance at the helical core from alanine disrupts or prevents correct triple-helix formation.\n- D is incorrect because the handedness of the collagen supercoil arises from chain geometry and is not flipped by a single point mutation.\n- E is unlikely; the sequence context (rich in proline/hydroxyproline) disfavors alpha-helix formation, and a single alanine substitution would not promote a stable alternative helix in the assembled trimer.\n\nTherefore, the most likely consequence is a local disruption or prevention of proper triple-helix formation due to steric hindrance in the core.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2098019"}, {"introduction": "While collagen has its unique triple helix, single polypeptide chains can also form alternative helices, such as the compact $3_{10}$-helix, often found at the ends of canonical $\\alpha$-helices.
