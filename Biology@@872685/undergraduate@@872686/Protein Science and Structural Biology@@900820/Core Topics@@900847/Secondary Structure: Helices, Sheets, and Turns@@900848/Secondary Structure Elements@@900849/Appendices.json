This consistency allows us to make precise calculations about its physical dimensions directly from its amino acid sequence.

A segment of this polypeptide is engineered to form a single, continuous, and stable alpha-helix. This helical segment is composed of exactly 45 amino acid residues. For an ideal alpha-helix, the structure is characterized by an average of 3.6 residues per complete turn and an axial rise of 0.15 nm per residue along the central axis of the helix.\n\nCalculate the total length of this alpha-helical segment, measured along its central axis. Express your answer in nanometers (nm) and round it to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total length of an alpha-helical segment of a polypeptide. We are given the number of amino acid residues in the helix, the number of residues per turn, and the axial rise per residue.\n\nLet $L$ be the total length of the alpha-helix.\nLet $N$ be the total number of amino acid residues in the helix.\nLet $d$ be the axial rise per residue.\nLet $n$ be the number of residues per turn.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n$N = 45$\n$d = 0.15$ nm\n$n = 3.6$\n\nThe total length of the helix is determined by the cumulative rise contributed by each amino acid residue along the helix axis. Each residue contributes a length $d$ to the total length $L$. Therefore, the total length is the product of the number of residues and the axial rise per residue.\n\nThe formula for the total length is:\n$$L = N \\times d$$\n\nThe number of residues per turn, $n=3.6$, is a characteristic property of the alpha-helix that defines its pitch (the length of one full turn), but it is not directly needed to calculate the total length of the helix given the number of residues. The pitch, $P$, would be $P = n \\times d = 3.6 \\times 0.15 \\text{ nm} = 0.54 \\text{ nm}$, but the total length is independent of the number of turns.\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into the length equation:\n$$L = 45 \\times 0.15 \\text{ nm}$$\n\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$L = 6.75 \\text{ nm}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

By learning to identify a \"helix-breaking\" residue, you will gain a deeper understanding of the chemical principles that govern protein folding and stability [@problem_id:2135532].", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a short, eight-residue peptide with the sequence Ala-Glu-Val-Ala-Lys-Leu-Met-Ala. Experimental data from Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy confirms that this peptide readily adopts an alpha-helical conformation in an aqueous buffer at physiological pH. The researcher aims to engineer a variant of this peptide that is significantly less likely to form an alpha-helix. They decide to achieve this by introducing a single point mutation at the fourth position, replacing the original Alanine (Ala) residue.\n\nWhich of the following single amino acid substitutions at position 4 would be the most effective at disrupting the alpha-helical structure of the peptide?\n\nA. Proline (Pro)\n\nB. Glycine (Gly)\n\nC. Aspartic Acid (Asp)\n\nD. Tryptophan (Trp)\n\nE. Leucine (Leu)", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the single amino acid substitution at position 4 of the peptide `Ala-Glu-Val-Ala-Lys-Leu-Met-Ala` that would be most disruptive to its alpha-helical structure. The original amino acid at position 4 is Alanine (Ala), which has a high propensity to form alpha-helices. We must evaluate the properties of each potential substitute amino acid in the context of alpha-helix stability.\n\nAn alpha-helix is a stable secondary structure characterized by specific backbone dihedral angles (phi, $\\phi \\approx -57^\\circ$ and psi, $\\psi \\approx -47^\\circ$) and a regular hydrogen-bonding pattern where the carbonyl oxygen of residue $i$ forms a hydrogen bond with the amide hydrogen of residue $i+4$. Any substitution that interferes with these structural requirements will destabilize the helix.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A. Proline (Pro)**\nProline is unique among the 20 common amino acids because its side chain is a five-membered ring that covalently bonds back to the backbone nitrogen atom. This has two major consequences for alpha-helices:\n1.  **Conformational Rigidity:** The ring structure restricts the possible values for the phi ($\\phi$) dihedral angle to approximately $-65^\\circ$. This value is outside the allowed range for a stable right-handed alpha-helix, introducing a severe kink in the backbone.\n2.  **Loss of Hydrogen Bond Donor:** The backbone nitrogen of proline is a secondary amine and lacks the hydrogen atom necessary to act as a hydrogen bond donor. Therefore, it cannot participate in the crucial $i \\to i+4$ hydrogen bonding pattern that stabilizes the helix.\nDue to these two factors, proline is known as a potent \"helix breaker\" and its presence in the middle of a helical segment is extremely disruptive.\n\n**B. Glycine (Gly)**\nGlycine has the simplest side chain, a single hydrogen atom. This lack of a bulky side chain gives glycine a very high degree of conformational flexibility. While it can technically adopt the phi/psi angles of an alpha-helix, it is not conformationally restricted to this state like other amino acids. There is a significant entropic cost to constraining the highly flexible glycine residue into the rigid helical conformation. Therefore, glycine tends to destabilize alpha-helices and is often found in flexible loops and turns. However, its disruptive effect is generally considered less severe than that of proline, which imposes a direct structural clash.\n\n**C. Aspartic Acid (Asp)**\nAspartic acid is a negatively charged amino acid at physiological pH. Replacing a small, non-polar residue like Alanine with a charged residue can be destabilizing, particularly if it is placed near other residues of like charge (though none are immediately adjacent here) or in a hydrophobic environment. However, aspartic acid itself does not have an intrinsic structural feature that prevents it from participating in an alpha-helix. Its helix propensity is lower than Alanine's but it is not considered a strong helix breaker.\n\n**D. Tryptophan (Trp)**\nTryptophan has a very large and bulky aromatic side chain. While extreme bulk can sometimes cause steric hindrance, Tryptophan is actually considered a moderate helix-former. Its bulk is not at the beta-carbon (unlike Val or Ile), so it does not sterically clash with the peptide backbone as severely. It can be readily accommodated within an alpha-helix.\n\n**E. Leucine (Leu)**\nLeucine is a hydrophobic amino acid with a branched aliphatic side chain. Along with Alanine and Methionine, Leucine is one of the strongest alpha-helix formers. Replacing one strong helix former (Ala) with another (Leu) would likely either maintain or even increase the stability of the alpha-helix, which is the opposite of the desired effect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing the options, Proline is the most disruptive substituent. It introduces a direct structural incompatibility by forcing an incorrect backbone angle and breaks the essential hydrogen-bonding network. While Glycine is also destabilizing due to entropic effects, the structural constraints imposed by Proline make it the most powerful and reliable helix breaker. Therefore, substituting Alanine at position 4 with Proline would be the most effective strategy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2135532"}, {"introduction": "The Ramachandran plot, which maps the distribution of backbone dihedral angles ($\\phi$ and $\\psi$), is a fundamental tool for validating protein structures. While it defines sterically \"allowed\" and \"disallowed\" conformations, real structures occasionally feature residues in disallowed regions for compelling functional reasons.

They discover that a single valine residue, located in the enzyme's active site, has backbone angles of $\\phi = +70^\\circ$ and $\\psi = +60^\\circ$. This point falls within a region of the Ramachandran plot that is generally considered disallowed for a valine residue. Despite this, the electron density map from the crystallographic data is unambiguous and confirms this conformation.\n\nWhich of the following statements presents the most plausible and chemically sound reason for this single valine residue to stably adopt an energetically unfavorable backbone conformation?\n\nA. The valine is located within a standard alpha-helical segment, where the collective hydrogen bonding of the helix is strong enough to accommodate the local strain of one residue.\n\nB. The crystal structure was solved from data collected at cryogenic temperatures (100 K), which can trap molecules in transient, high-energy states not present at physiological temperatures.\n\nC. This specific conformation allows the backbone carbonyl oxygen of the valine to form a crucial and exceptionally strong hydrogen bond with a hydroxyl group on the enzyme's bound substrate, an interaction essential for catalysis.\n\nD. The valine residue is immediately preceded by a proline residue, which restricts the rotational freedom of the polypeptide chain and forces the valine into this unusual conformation.\n\nE. The high concentration of salt in the crystallization buffer altered the hydrophobic effect, causing the valine's side chain to pack in an unusual way that forces the backbone to twist.", "solution": "We begin from the principle that the Ramachandran plot reflects steric constraints dictated by van der Waals radii and peptide geometry; for most residues (excluding glycine and proline), large regions of $(\\phi,\\psi)$ are sterically disallowed. The observed $(\\phi,\\psi)$ for valine, $\\phi=+70^{\\circ}$ and $\\psi=+60^{\\circ}$, lies in a generally disallowed region for non-gly, non-pro residues, implying an intrinsic torsional penalty $\\Delta G_{\\text{torsion}}>0$ associated with steric strain.\n\nFor a residue to stably adopt such a conformation, the total free energy change must be favorable:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{total}}=\\Delta G_{\\text{torsion}}+\\Delta G_{\\text{int}}+\\Delta G_{\\text{env}}  0,\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G_{\\text{int}}$ encompasses stabilizing specific interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds, electrostatics, metal coordination) and $\\Delta G_{\\text{env}}$ reflects environmental contributions (e.g., desolvation, packing). In active sites, desolvated microenvironments can strengthen hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions, increasing the magnitude of negative $\\Delta G_{\\text{int}}$ sufficiently to offset positive $\\Delta G_{\\text{torsion}}$.\n\nEvaluate each option against these physical-chemical criteria:\n\nA. Alpha helices have canonical dihedrals near $\\phi\\approx -60^{\\circ}$, $\\psi\\approx -45^{\\circ}$. A residue at $\\phi=+70^{\\circ}$, $\\psi=+60^{\\circ}$ would not integrate into a standard helix without disrupting the backbone hydrogen-bonding pattern and geometry. Helical collective hydrogen bonds stabilize helical conformations but do not plausibly stabilize one residue in a left-handed, disallowed sector. Thus, this does not provide a chemically sound mechanism for stabilizing the specific unusual angles.\n\nB. Cryogenic data collection can trap conformations by reducing kinetic energy, but this is not a stabilizing thermodynamic mechanism; rather, it suggests a potential artifact. The prompt states that the electron density is unambiguous, and the question asks for a reason the residue can stably adopt the conformation. Cryo-cooling alone does not provide a specific energetic stabilization term $\\Delta G_{\\text{int}}$ and therefore is not the most plausible chemical explanation for stability.\n\nC. A specific backbone carbonyl–substrate hydroxyl hydrogen bond can be strong, particularly in a low-dielectric, desolvated active site with optimal geometry. This introduces a stabilizing term $\\Delta G_{\\text{HB}}0$ that can offset $\\Delta G_{\\text{torsion}}0$, satisfying\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{torsion}}+\\Delta G_{\\text{HB}}  0\n$$\nif the hydrogen bond is sufficiently strong and functionally optimized (as is often observed in catalysis, where backbone atoms help position and stabilize substrates or transition states). This is a well-established and chemically sound mechanism for stabilizing otherwise unfavorable backbone conformations in enzyme active sites.\n\nD. Proline primarily restricts its own $\\phi$ angle and affects the cis/trans isomerization of the preceding peptide bond. While proline can influence local backbone conformations, it does not typically force the subsequent residue into a highly disallowed $(\\phi,\\psi)$ in the positive-$\\phi$ quadrant. This is not a recognized general mechanism to generate and stabilize the specific observed angles.\n\nE. Salt concentration can modulate ionic interactions and solvation but does not directly impose backbone torsional angles via the hydrophobic effect on a valine side chain. Crystal packing and ionic strength effects are not a robust or specific mechanism for forcing and stabilizing a single residue’s backbone into a disallowed conformation, especially without a clear specific interaction compensating the torsional penalty.\n\nTherefore, the only option that provides a specific, chemically plausible stabilizing interaction of sufficient magnitude to counteract the torsional strain, consistent with active-site function and unambiguous density, is a strong, functionally essential hydrogen bond made possible by the unusual backbone geometry.\n\nThe most plausible and chemically sound reason is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2135544"}]}
