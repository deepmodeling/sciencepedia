The mathematical form of the Hill equation becomes identical to the equation for independent binding sites, indicating that the binding of a ligand to one site does not alter the affinity of other sites on the protein for the same ligand.\n\nB.

This statement correctly points out that when $n_H=1$, the Hill equation reduces to the simpler equation for independent binding sites. It correctly interprets this mathematical simplification to mean that the binding sites do not influence each other's affinity. This is the definition of non-cooperative binding. This statement is correct.\n\nB. This is incorrect. Perfect or strong positive cooperativity is characterized by a large Hill coefficient ($n_H  1$). A value of $n_H=1$ signifies the absence of cooperativity.\n\nC. This is incorrect. Negative cooperativity is characterized by a Hill coefficient less than 1 ($n_H  1$).\n\nD. This is incorrect. The Hill coefficient ($n_H$) is a measure of cooperativity, not affinity. Affinity is measured by the dissociation constant ($K_d$ or the related $K_A$). A protein can have high or low affinity for its ligand, regardless of whether its binding is cooperative, non-cooperative, or anti-cooperative. Therefore, $n_H=1$ gives no information about the magnitude of the affinity.\n\nE. This statement is a plausible but not a necessary conclusion. A monomeric protein with a single binding site will indeed have $n_H=1$ because cooperativity requires multiple interacting binding sites. However, a multimeric protein (e.g., a tetramer) can also exhibit $n_H=1$ if its multiple binding sites are completely independent and do not communicate with each other. Thus, observing $n_H=1$ does not *prove* the protein is a monomer.\n\nBased on this analysis, statement A provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for why a Hill coefficient of 1 signifies non-cooperative binding.
