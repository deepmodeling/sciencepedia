In its ATP-bound state, Hsp70 has an \"open\" conformation with low affinity for its unfolded protein substrates, allowing for their rapid binding and release. The hydrolysis of ATP to Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate triggers a conformational change to a \"closed\" state, which has a high affinity for the substrate, effectively locking the substrate in place for folding.\n\nImagine a biochemical experiment where a purified Hsp70 system, containing all necessary co-chaperones, is provided with an abundance of unfolded protein substrate.

The function of Hsp70 is governed by a nucleotide-dependent cycle. In its Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)-bound state, Hsp70 has low affinity for its substrates and exhibits rapid binding and dissociation. Upon binding a substrate, ATP is hydrolyzed to Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP), a process greatly accelerated by co-chaperones of the Hsp40 family. This hydrolysis triggers a conformational change that locks Hsp70 into a high-affinity, ADP-bound state, tightly gripping the substrate protein. The cycle is completed when a Nucleotide Exchange Factor (NEF) catalyzes the release of ADP and the binding of a new ATP molecule, which returns Hsp70 to its low-affinity state and releases the substrate.\n\nImagine a genetically engineered mutant of Hsp70.
