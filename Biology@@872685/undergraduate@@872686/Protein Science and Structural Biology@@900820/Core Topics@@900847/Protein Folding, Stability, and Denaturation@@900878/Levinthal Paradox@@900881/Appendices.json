One early hypothesis proposed that folding occurs through a random search process, where the protein explores all possible conformations until it finds the one with the lowest energy. Let's investigate the feasibility of this hypothesis.\n\nConsider a small, hypothetical protein consisting of a chain of $L=100$ amino acid residues. To simplify the model, assume that for each residue, the peptide backbone can adopt one of $k=3$ distinct, stable conformational states.

The protein has $L=100$ residues, and each residue can independently be in one of $k=3$ states.
