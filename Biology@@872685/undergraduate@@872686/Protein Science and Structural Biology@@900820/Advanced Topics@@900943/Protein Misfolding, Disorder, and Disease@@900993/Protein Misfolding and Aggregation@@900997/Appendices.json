This exercise asks you to apply this fundamental principle to a practical problem of protein engineering. By considering how different mutations might disrupt a tightly packed hydrophobic core, you can learn to predict which changes are most likely to lead to destabilization and misfolding [@problem_id:2129379].", "problem": "A hypothetical globular protein, named cryostabilin, functions optimally in a cold-water organism and possesses a well-defined, tightly packed hydrophobic core. A key residue for maintaining this core structure is an isoleucine located at position 87 (Ile87), which is completely buried and surrounded by other nonpolar side chains. A researcher aims to create a mutant version of cryostabilin that is significantly more susceptible to misfolding and aggregation when subjected to a moderate increase in temperature (thermal stress). Which of the following single amino acid substitutions at position 87 would be most likely to achieve this goal?\n\nA. Isoleucine to Leucine (Ile87Leu)\n\nB. Isoleucine to Valine (Ile87Val)\n\nC. Isoleucine to Aspartic Acid (Ile87Asp)\n\nD. Isoleucine to Phenylalanine (Ile87Phe)", "solution": "Goal: identify the single substitution at a completely buried, hydrophobic-core isoleucine (Ile87) that most increases susceptibility to misfolding and aggregation under moderate thermal stress. Thermodynamically, this corresponds to choosing the mutation that most destabilizes the native fold.\n\nUse the protein folding free energy framework. The thermodynamic stability is given by\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}} = \\Delta H_{\\text{fold}} - T \\Delta S_{\\text{fold}},\n$$\nand the mutational effect on stability is\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}^{\\text{mut}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}^{\\text{WT}}.\n$$\nA positive $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ indicates destabilization of the folded state, lowering the barrier to unfolding and thus increasing misfolding and aggregation upon heating.\n\nFor a tightly packed hydrophobic core, stability is dominated by the hydrophobic effect and optimal packing. Consider each substitution:\n\n1) Ile87Leu (A): Both Ile and Leu are aliphatic, nonpolar, and of similar volume and hydrophobicity. Core packing and the hydrophobic effect are largely preserved. Therefore,\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}(\\text{Ile} \\to \\text{Leu}) \\approx 0,\n$$\nimplying minimal destabilization.\n\n2) Ile87Val (B): Val is slightly smaller but still nonpolar and hydrophobic. While a small cavity could form, the hydrophobic character is maintained. The destabilization is typically modest:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}(\\text{Ile} \\to \\text{Val}) > 0 \\text{ (small)}.\n$$\n\n3) Ile87Asp (C): Aspartic acid carries a negatively charged side chain under physiological conditions. Burying a charged, polar group in a hydrophobic core incurs a large desolvation penalty and often leaves hydrogen-bonding capacity unsatisfied, both strongly destabilizing the folded state. This produces a large positive shift in folding free energy:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}(\\text{Ile} \\to \\text{Asp}) \\gg 0.\n$$\nConsequently, $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ becomes much less negative (or even positive), lowering the melting temperature and promoting partial unfolding under moderate heat, which exposes hydrophobic patches and drives aggregation.\n\n4) Ile87Phe (D): Phenylalanine is hydrophobic and often compatible with cores, though bulkier. While it may introduce some steric strain if packing is tight, it maintains the hydrophobic character and can even be stabilizing in some contexts. Thus,\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}(\\text{Ile} \\to \\text{Phe}) \\approx 0 \\text{ to modest } > 0,\n$$\nbut typically far less destabilizing than burying a charged residue.\n\nComparative conclusion: Introducing a buried charge (Asp) maximally destabilizes the hydrophobic core due to large enthalpic penalties from desolvation and unsatisfied interactions, producing the largest positive $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ and thus the greatest susceptibility to thermally induced misfolding and aggregation. Therefore, the most effective single substitution is Ile87Asp.\n\nHence, the correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2129379"}, {"introduction": "Protein misfolding is not just a theoretical concept; it is a physical process with observable consequences.

In its native, functional state in a buffer solution, Aggregatin is known to be predominantly composed of alpha-helical secondary structures. When the solution is incubated at 37°C with gentle agitation for several hours, the protein denatures and subsequently aggregates to form insoluble amyloid fibrils. Further biophysical characterization reveals that these amyloid fibrils are rich in beta-sheet structures.\n\nThe entire process, from the initial soluble state to the final aggregated state, is monitored using far-ultraviolet (far-UV) Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Which of the following choices best describes the expected change in the CD spectrum as the native, alpha-helical protein converts into beta-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils?\n\nA. The spectrum will transition from having a broad negative minimum around 218 nm to having two distinct negative minima at approximately 222 nm and 208 nm.\n\nB.

The spectrum will show a significant increase in the magnitude of the negative signal at both 222 nm and 208 nm, indicating stabilization of the structure.\n\nE. The spectrum will remain largely unchanged because Circular Dichroism is primarily sensitive to the concentration of the protein, which does not change.", "solution": "Far-UV Circular Dichroism (CD) monitors secondary structure because the peptide bond exhibits distinct differential absorption of left- versus right-circularly polarized light arising from its electronic transitions (notably the amide transitions). Each major secondary structure yields a characteristic CD signature:\n- An alpha-helix gives two distinct negative minima at approximately 222 nm and 208 nm, and a positive maximum near 190 nm.\n- A beta-sheet gives a single, broad negative minimum centered around 216 to 218 nm, and a positive maximum near 195 nm.\n- An unordered (random coil) structure typically shows a single strong negative band near 195 to 200 nm.\n\nIn the scenario, the native Aggregatin is alpha-helical in solution and, upon incubation at 37 °C with agitation, denatures and aggregates into amyloid fibrils that are beta-sheet-rich. Therefore, as the protein transitions from alpha-helix to beta-sheet, the CD spectrum is expected to change from having two distinct negative minima at approximately 222 nm and 208 nm (alpha-helix) to having a single, broad negative minimum around 218 nm (beta-sheet).\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A describes the reverse transition (beta-sheet to alpha-helix), so it is incorrect.\n- Option B describes the random coil signature near 200 nm, not beta-sheet, so it is incorrect.\n- Option C correctly states a transition from two minima at 222 nm and 208 nm to a single broad minimum around 218 nm, matching alpha-helix to beta-sheet.\n- Option D implies increased alpha-helical stabilization, contradicting fibril formation.\n- Option E is incorrect because CD is sensitive to secondary structure, not primarily to concentration.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2129375"}, {"introduction": "The tendency of a protein to aggregate is directly linked to its thermodynamic stability—the less stable the folded state, the more unfolded, aggregation-prone species will be present at equilibrium.

The aggregation process is known to be initiated by the formation of a stable nucleus. For AggreProt, experimental data show that the rate-limiting step is the formation of a dimer from two unfolded protein monomers. Therefore, the initial rate of aggregation is directly proportional to the square of the concentration of the unfolded protein, $[U]$.\n\nThe stability of the protein is characterized by the Gibbs free energy of folding, $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$, which represents the free energy difference between the folded (F) and unfolded (U) states, $G_F - G_U$. In pure aqueous buffer at a temperature of $310$ K, $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ for AggreProt is $-35.0$ kJ/mol.
