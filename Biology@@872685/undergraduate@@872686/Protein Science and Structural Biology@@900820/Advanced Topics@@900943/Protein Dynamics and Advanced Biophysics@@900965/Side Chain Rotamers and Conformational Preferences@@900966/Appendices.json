The lysine side chain is a linear chain of four methylene groups followed by an amino group. The structure, starting from the alpha-carbon (C$\\alpha$), is:\n-C$\\alpha$ -- C$\\beta$H$_2$ -- C$\\gamma$H$_2$ -- C$\\delta$H$_2$ -- C$\\epsilon$H$_2$ -- N$\\zeta$H$_3^+$\n\nA $\\chi$ angle corresponds to a rotation around a single bond connecting two non-hydrogen atoms in the side chain. We can identify these bonds sequentially starting from the C$\\alpha$-C$\\beta$ bond:\n1.  The C$\\alpha$-C$\\beta$ bond. Rotation around this bond is defined by the dihedral angle $\\chi_1$ (atoms N-C$\\alpha$-C$\\beta$-C$\\gamma$).\n2.  The C$\\beta$-C$\\gamma$ bond. Rotation around this bond is defined by the dihedral angle $\\chi_2$ (atoms C$\\alpha$-C$\\beta$-C$\\gamma$-C$\\delta$).\n3.  The C$\\gamma$-C$\\delta$ bond. Rotation around this bond is defined by the dihedral angle $\\chi_3$ (atoms C$\\beta$-C$\\gamma$-C$\\delta$-C$\\epsilon$).\n4.  The C$\\delta$-C$\\epsilon$ bond. Rotation around this bond is defined by the dihedral angle $\\chi_4$ (atoms C$\\gamma$-C$\\delta$-C$\\epsilon$-N$\\zeta$).\n\nThe final bond is C$\\epsilon$-N$\\zeta$. While there is rotation around this bond, the standard definition of $\\chi$ angles for lysine typically includes the four rotations within its carbon-chain framework. Thus, the lysine side chain has 4 definable $\\chi$ angles.\n\nNext, let's analyze the side chain of tryptophan. The tryptophan side chain consists of a methylene group attached to an indole ring. The structure, starting from the C$\\alpha$, is:\n-C$\\alpha$ -- C$\\beta$H$_2$ -- C$\\gamma$ -- (Indole Ring)\n\nWe identify the rotatable single bonds between heavy atoms:\n1.  The C$\\alpha$-C$\\beta$ bond. Rotation around this bond is defined by the dihedral angle $\\chi_1$ (atoms N-C$\\alpha$-C$\\beta$-C$\\gamma$).\n2.  The C$\\beta$-C$\\gamma$ bond. Rotation around this bond is defined by the dihedral angle $\\chi_2$ (atoms C$\\alpha$-C$\\beta$-C$\\gamma$-C$\\delta_1$). This rotation changes the orientation of the entire indole ring relative to the backbone.\n\nThe indole ring itself is a rigid, planar aromatic system. The bonds within the ring are part of a conjugated system and are not freely rotatable. Therefore, there are no further $\\chi$ angles within the indole group. Thus, the tryptophan side chain has 2 definable $\\chi$ angles.\n\nFinally, we compare the number of $\\chi$ angles for each side chain.\nNumber of $\\chi$ angles for lysine = 4.\nNumber of $\\chi$ angles for tryptophan = 2.\n\nThe difference is $4 - 2 = 2$.\nTherefore, lysine has 2 more $\\chi$ angles than tryptophan. This corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2137281"}, {"introduction": "Once we know how many $\\chi$ angles a side chain has, the next step is to visualize the specific conformations, or rotamers, that result from rotation around these bonds. Newman projections are an essential tool for this, allowing us to look down a bond and clearly see the steric relationships between substituents. This exercise [@problem_id:2137294] will guide you through relating the defined $\\chi_1$ angles of valine to their Newman projections and using hypothetical energy values to identify the most stable conformation in a specific environment.", "problem": "In structural biology, the conformation of amino acid side chains, described by rotamers, is crucial for protein folding and function. You are studying a specific valine residue located in the binding pocket of an enzyme. Due to interactions with a bound substrate, the typical energetic preferences of the valine side-chain rotamers are altered. The three canonical staggered rotamers about the $C_{\\alpha}$-$C_{\\beta}$ bond are defined by the dihedral angle $\\chi_1$, which is the angle between the N-$C_{\\alpha}$-$C_{\\beta}$-$C_{\\gamma1}$ atoms. The rotamers are: gauche-plus (g+), with $\\chi_1 \\approx +60^{\\circ}$; trans (t), with $\\chi_1 \\approx 180^{\\circ}$; and gauche-minus (g-), with $\\chi_1 \\approx -60^{\\circ}$.\n\nYour quantum mechanical calculations for this specific valine residue have yielded the following relative potential energies for these three rotamers:\n\n-   $E(\\text{g+}) = 2.1 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n-   $E(\\text{t}) = 8.5 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n-   $E(\\text{g-}) = 5.4 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n\nConsidering a Newman projection for this L-valine residue looking down the $C_{\\alpha}$-$C_{\\beta}$ bond (with $C_{\\alpha}$ as the front carbon and $C_{\\beta}$ as the back carbon), which of the following statements accurately describes the most energetically favorable conformation? The substituents on the front carbon ($C_{\\alpha}$) are the main-chain amide Nitrogen (N), the main-chain carbonyl Carbon (C'), and the alpha-hydrogen (H$_{\\alpha}$). The substituents on the back carbon ($C_{\\beta}$) are the beta-hydrogen (H$_{\\beta}$), the gamma-1 carbon ($C_{\\gamma1}$), and the gamma-2 carbon ($C_{\\gamma2}$).\n\nA.

The $C_{\\gamma1}$ carbon is syn-periplanar to the main-chain Nitrogen, leading to a fully eclipsed conformation.\n\nE. One of the gamma-substituents is a hydroxyl group, which is positioned anti-periplanar to the main-chain Nitrogen to form a stabilizing hydrogen bond.", "solution": "The first step is to identify the most energetically favorable conformation using the provided energy values. The conformation with the lowest potential energy will be the most stable and thus the most favorable.\nThe given energies are:\n$E(\\text{g+}) = 2.1 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n$E(\\text{t}) = 8.5 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n$E(\\text{g-}) = 5.4 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n\nComparing these values, the gauche-plus (g+) conformation has the lowest energy ($2.1 \\text{ kJ/mol}$), making it the most favorable conformation for this specific valine residue.\n\nThe second step is to determine the spatial arrangement of the atoms in the g+ conformation as viewed in a Newman projection looking down the $C_{\\alpha}$-$C_{\\beta}$ axis.\n\nThe front carbon is $C_{\\alpha}$, and its substituents are the main-chain amide N, the main-chain carbonyl C', and the alpha-hydrogen H$_{\\alpha}$. For an L-amino acid, when viewed from $C_{\\alpha}$ to $C_{\\beta}$, these groups are arranged in a clockwise order: N, C', H$_{\\alpha}$. We can set up a reference Newman projection by placing the main-chain Nitrogen (N) at the 12 o'clock position. Given the clockwise arrangement, the Carbonyl Carbon (C') would be at the 4 o'clock position, and the alpha-hydrogen (H$_{\\alpha}$) at the 8 o'clock position.\n\nThe back carbon is $C_{\\beta}$. Its substituents are H$_{\\beta}$, $C_{\\gamma1}$, and $C_{\\gamma2}$. These will be located at the staggered positions: 2 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and 10 o'clock.\n\nThe problem specifies that the g+ conformation corresponds to a dihedral angle $\\chi_1 = \\angle(\\text{N-C}_{\\alpha}\\text{-C}_{\\beta}\\text{-C}_{\\gamma1}) \\approx +60^{\\circ}$. A positive dihedral angle corresponds to a clockwise rotation of the substituent on the back carbon ($C_{\\gamma1}$) relative to the substituent on the front carbon (N).\n\nStarting with N at the 12 o'clock position, a +60° rotation places $C_{\\gamma1}$ at the 2 o'clock position.\nNow we can analyze the relationship of $C_{\\gamma1}$ to the substituents on the front carbon:\n-   The angle between $C_{\\gamma1}$ (at 2 o'clock) and N (at 12 o'clock) is 60°. This is a \"gauche\" relationship.\n-   The angle between $C_{\\gamma1}$ (at 2 o'clock) and C' (at 4 o'clock) is also 60°. This is also a \"gauche\" relationship.\n-   The angle between $C_{\\gamma1}$ (at 2 o'clock) and H$_{\\alpha}$ (at 8 o'clock) is 180°. This is an \"anti\" or \"anti-periplanar\" relationship.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\nA. \"The $C_{\\gamma1}$ carbon is positioned such that it is gauche to both the main-chain Nitrogen and the main-chain Carbonyl Carbon.\" This description perfectly matches our analysis of the g+ conformation.\n\nB. \"The $C_{\\gamma1}$ carbon is positioned anti-periplanar to the main-chain Nitrogen...\" This describes the trans (t) rotamer, where $\\chi_1 \\approx 180^{\\circ}$. In our projection, this would place $C_{\\gamma1}$ at the 6 o'clock position. This is not the most favorable conformation.\n\nC. \"The $C_{\\gamma1}$ carbon is positioned such that it is gauche to both the main-chain Nitrogen and the alpha-hydrogen.\" For $C_{\\gamma1}$ to be gauche to N (12 o'clock) and H$_{\\alpha}$ (8 o'clock), it would need to be at the 10 o'clock position. This corresponds to the gauche-minus (g-) rotamer, where $\\chi_1 \\approx -60^{\\circ}$. This is not the most favorable conformation.\n\nD. \"The $C_{\\gamma1}$ carbon is syn-periplanar to the main-chain Nitrogen, leading to a fully eclipsed conformation.\" Syn-periplanar means a dihedral angle of 0°, which is a high-energy eclipsed conformation, not a staggered one. The energies given are for the low-energy staggered rotamers.\n\nE. \"One of the gamma-substituents is a hydroxyl group...\" This is factually incorrect. The side chain of valine consists of an isopropyl group (two methyl groups, $C_{\\gamma1}$ and $C_{\\gamma2}$, attached to $C_{\\beta}$), not a hydroxyl group. This option describes threonine or serine.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that correctly describes the most energetically favorable (g+) conformation is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2137294"}, {"introduction": "While rotamer libraries provide a valuable guide to the most probable, low-energy side-chain conformations, protein structures are not governed by intrinsic preferences alone. In the complex environment of an active site, a side chain's final conformation is determined by the net free energy of the entire system, including interactions with substrates or other residues. This problem [@problem_id:2137277] presents a common scenario in structural biology: the observation of a rare, high-energy rotamer, challenging you to deduce the biophysical reason why such a state might be specifically selected for a crucial biological function.", "problem": "In structural biology, the conformation of an amino acid side chain is described by a set of torsion angles known as chi angles ($\\chi$). Due to steric hindrance and torsional strain, side chains preferentially adopt specific low-energy conformations called rotamers. These preferred rotamers are cataloged in libraries (e.g., the Dunbrack rotamer library) and represent the most statistically probable states.\n\nAn investigator has determined a high-resolution (1.5 Å) X-ray crystal structure of a novel enzyme. In the active site, they observe an Asparagine (Asn) residue whose side chain conformation corresponds to a very rare, high-energy rotamer. This specific conformation would, in isolation, create a significant steric clash between the side chain's carboxamide group and atoms of the protein's own backbone. Further biochemical experiments have confirmed that this particular Asparagine residue is absolutely essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity.\n\nGiven this context, which of the following statements provides the most likely biophysical explanation for why this energetically unfavorable rotamer is observed in the structure?\n\nA. The Ramachandran plot, which governs protein stereochemistry, dictates that as long as the backbone is in an allowed conformation, any side chain rotamer is equally probable.\n\nB. The observation is an artifact of the crystallization process; interactions with adjacent molecules in the crystal lattice have forced the side chain into a non-physiological conformation not relevant to its function in solution.\n\nC. The high intrinsic energy of this specific rotamer is more than compensated for by the formation of crucial, highly favorable stabilizing interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds) with the enzyme's substrate, which is a prerequisite for catalysis.\n\nD. The force fields used to classify rotamers as \"high-energy\" are known to be inaccurate for polar amino acids like Asparagine, so the observed conformation is likely a low-energy state that is misclassified.\n\nE. Random thermal energy at physiological temperatures allows the side chain to freely rotate, and the crystal structure simply captured a random, transient, high-energy state which has no particular functional significance.", "solution": "We model side-chain conformational populations using thermodynamics. For a given rotamer $i$ with free energy $\\Delta G_{i}$ in a given environment, its population satisfies\n$$\nP_{i} \\propto \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{i}}{k_{B} T}\\right).\n$$\nIntrinsic rotamer preferences (as in rotamer libraries) reflect $\\Delta G_{i}$ in an average protein environment without specific binding partners, where sterics and torsional strain dominate. The problem states that the Asn rotamer is intrinsically high energy and would clash with the backbone “in isolation,” i.e., without compensating interactions. However, the residue is essential for catalysis, implying functional selection of its conformation.\n\nIn an enzyme active site, the relevant free energy includes not only the intrinsic rotameric strain but also stabilizing interactions with bound ligands (substrate, transition-state analog, or product) and the active-site environment. We can decompose a rotamer’s free energy in the catalytic complex as\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{rotamer strain}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{int}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{env}},\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G_{\\text{rotamer strain}} > 0$ for a rare, strained rotamer, $\\Delta G_{\\text{int}} < 0$ accounts for favorable specific interactions with the ligand (e.g., hydrogen bonds, electrostatics, dipole interactions), and $\\Delta G_{\\text{env}}$ reflects other environmental contributions (e.g., desolvation, packing). If $|\\Delta G_{\\text{int}}|$ is sufficiently large, then $\\Delta G_{\\text{total}}$ can be lower than that of alternative rotamers, making the high-energy rotamer the most populated state in the functional complex:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{total}}^{\\text{rare}} < \\Delta G_{\\text{total}}^{\\text{common}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad P_{\\text{rare}} > P_{\\text{common}}.\n$$\nThis is consistent with the principle of active-site preorganization and with catalysis by preferential stabilization of the transition state: enzymes often pay an internal strain cost to position key residues so they can form optimal interactions with the substrate or, especially, the transition state, thereby lowering the activation free energy.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because the Ramachandran plot concerns backbone $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ angles, not side-chain $\\chi$ rotamers, and side-chain rotamers are not equally probable; their probabilities follow $P \\propto \\exp(-\\Delta G/(k_{B} T))$.\n- B is less likely as a primary explanation in this context: high-resolution active-site conformations, especially for residues essential for catalysis, typically reflect functionally relevant states. While crystal contacts can influence conformations, the most biophysically grounded reason for a strained, essential residue is stabilization by specific interactions with the substrate or transition state.\n- C is the most consistent explanation: the energy penalty of the rare rotamer is compensated by strong, favorable interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds) with the substrate or transition state, which are necessary for catalysis, making the net free energy favorable.\n- D is incorrect; rotamer libraries are primarily empirical, derived from high-resolution structures. Asparagine side-chain energetics are well characterized; a global misclassification for polar residues is unlikely.\n- E is unlikely because X-ray structures report time- and ensemble-averaged electron density; capturing a random, transient, high-energy conformation without functional stabilization is improbable, and the residue’s essential role argues for functional selection rather than random sampling.\n\nTherefore, the most likely biophysical explanation is that favorable, catalytically essential interactions with the substrate compensate for the intrinsic strain of the rare rotamer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2137277"}]}
