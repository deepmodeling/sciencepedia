Genetic and biochemical data suggest that Motilin-R has a distinct two-domain architecture: a long, intrinsically disordered N-terminal tail comprising residues 1-40, and a well-structured, rigid globular core domain comprising residues 41-150.\n\nTo probe the backbone dynamics of this protein on the picosecond-to-nanosecond timescale, the biologist performs a $^{15}\\text{N}\\{^1\\text{H}\\}$ heteronuclear Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) experiment.

The key is to understand the relationship between the measured NOE value and the molecular motion of the protein backbone.\n\nStep 1: Understand the principle of the heteronuclear NOE experiment.\nThe $^{15}\\text{N}\\{^1\\text{H}\\}$ heteronuclear NOE measures the transfer of magnetization from a proton ($^1\\text{H}$) to its directly bonded nitrogen ($^{15}\\text{N}$) via dipole-dipole interactions. The efficiency of this transfer is highly dependent on the motional properties of the N-H bond vector. Specifically, it is sensitive to motions on the timescale ranging from picoseconds to nanoseconds (ps-ns). The problem statement provides the essential interpretation for a protein of this size:\n- High positive NOE (e.g., ~0.8) indicates restricted motion, or rigidity. The N-H vector tumbles slowly with the overall molecule.\n- Low positive, zero, or negative NOE indicates fast internal motion, or flexibility. The N-H vector reorients rapidly on a ps-ns timescale, in addition to the overall molecular tumbling.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the dynamic properties of the different regions of Motilin-R.\nThe protein is described as having two distinct regions:\n- **Residues 1-40:** This is the N-terminal tail, described as \"long, intrinsically disordered.\" Disordered regions lack a stable tertiary structure and are characterized by a high degree of conformational flexibility. Their backbone segments undergo rapid, large-amplitude motions on the ps-ns timescale.\n- **Residues 41-150:** This is the core domain, described as \"well-structured, rigid globular.\" In a rigid, folded domain, the backbone N-H bond vectors are constrained. Their primary motion is the slow tumbling of the entire protein molecule in solution, with very little independent internal motion on the fast ps-ns timescale.\n\nStep 3: Predict the NOE values for each region.\n- For the flexible N-terminal tail (residues 1-40), the fast internal motions will lead to an inefficient NOE transfer. This will result in low positive, zero, or even negative NOE values.\n- For the rigid core domain (residues 41-150), the restricted internal motion means the N-H vectors tumble slowly with the protein. This condition leads to an efficient NOE transfer, resulting in high positive NOE values, typically around 0.8 for a protein of this size.\n\nStep 4: Synthesize the full plot and evaluate the options.\nA plot of NOE value versus residue number should show a clear distinction between the two regions. We expect a segment of low/negative values for residues 1-40, followed by a sharp transition to a segment of high, relatively uniform positive values for residues 41-150.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given choices against this prediction:\n- **A:** This option suggests high NOE values for the tail and low values for the core. This is the exact opposite of our prediction and incorrectly associates flexibility with high NOE and rigidity with low NOE.\n- **B:** This option describes low or negative values for the first 40 residues (the flexible tail) and high positive values for residues 41-150 (the rigid core). This perfectly matches our analysis.\n- **C:** This option suggests uniform flexibility for the entire protein. This is incorrect as it ignores the presence of the rigid core domain.\n- **D:** This option describes a gradual linear increase. This is physically unrealistic. Protein domains typically have distinct dynamic properties, leading to sharp transitions in dynamic parameters at domain boundaries, not a smooth gradient across the entire sequence.\n- **E:** This option suggests uniform rigidity for the entire protein. This is incorrect as it ignores the presence of the long, flexible N-terminal tail.\n\nTherefore, the description that best characterizes the expected experimental outcome is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2122255"}, {"introduction": "Building on the ability to interpret a static dynamic profile, we can use NMR relaxation to probe how dynamics respond to specific perturbations, such as mutations. This exercise explores how a site-directed mutation designed to alter local flexibility would manifest in the NMR data. By predicting the consequences of replacing a small, flexible residue with a large, bulky one, you will solidify your understanding of both the heteronuclear NOE and the closely related generalized order parameter, $S^2$ [@problem_id:2122235].", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a hypothetical protein called \"Flexilin\" using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. A particular region of interest is a highly flexible surface loop. To investigate the loop's dynamics, a site-directed mutation is introduced at position 75, changing the original small, flexible Glycine (Gly) residue to a large, bulky Tryptophan (Trp) residue. The experiments are designed to measure two key parameters that report on protein dynamics on the picosecond to nanosecond timescale: the $^{15}\\text{N}$-$^1\\text{H}$ Heteronuclear Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) and the generalized order parameter, $S^2$.\n\nThe NOE value in this context reflects the motional properties of the N-H bond; values closer to a theoretical maximum of approximately 0.85 indicate restricted motion, while lower or even negative values indicate high flexibility. The order parameter, $S^2$, directly quantifies the spatial amplitude of the N-H bond vector's motion, ranging from 0 for completely unrestricted, isotropic motion to 1 for a completely rigid, fixed orientation.\n\nAssuming the mutation from Glycine to Tryptophan at position 75 causes the local backbone segment to become significantly more rigid, what is the most likely effect on the measured NOE and $S^2$ values for this specific residue?\n\nA. The NOE value will decrease, and the $S^2$ value will decrease.\n\nB. The NOE value will increase, and the $S^2$ value will decrease.\n\nC. The NOE value will decrease, and the $S^2$ value will increase.\n\nD. The NOE value will increase, and the $S^2$ value will increase.\n\nE. There will be no significant change in either the NOE or the $S^2$ value.", "solution": "We identify the relevant physical interpretations. The heteronuclear NOE reflects the motional properties of the N-H bond on the picosecond to nanosecond timescale; for restricted motion, the NOE approaches its maximal positive value (approximately 0.85 in typical experimental conditions), while for highly flexible sites the NOE is reduced and can be near zero or negative. The generalized order parameter $S^2$ quantifies the spatial restriction of the N-H bond vector; by definition $0 \\leq S^2 \\leq 1$, with $S^2 = 1$ for a completely rigid bond and $S^2 = 0$ for completely unrestricted, isotropic motion.\n\nWe analyze the effect of the mutation. Replacing a small, flexible Gly with a large, bulky Trp at position 75 introduces steric hindrance and packing, which reduces local internal motions and increases rigidity of the backbone segment containing the N-H bond. Therefore, the amplitude of internal fluctuations decreases and the bond vector becomes more constrained.\n\nWe connect rigidity to the observables. Increased rigidity reduces fast internal motion contributions to the spectral density at high frequencies and increases the effective cross-relaxation relative to longitudinal relaxation, leading to an increased heteronuclear NOE value toward its theoretical maximum. Simultaneously, because $S^2$ measures the restriction of the angular space accessible to the N-H vector, a decrease in motional amplitude directly increases $S^2$ toward $1$.\n\nTherefore, if the mutation causes significant local rigidification, both the NOE and $S^2$ increase.
