This first practice challenges you to predict the 2D gel pattern for a heterotetrameric protein. A key insight to gain here is understanding that the standard conditions of 2D-GE, particularly the use of SDS, are denaturing and will dissociate non-covalently linked subunits, meaning you resolve the individual components, not the intact complex [@problem_id:2116012].", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a newly-discovered protein named \"motilin-associated regulator\" (MAR), which is known to be a heterotetramer. The complex consists of two identical alpha subunits and two identical beta subunits, held together by non-covalent interactions. Through separate experiments, the properties of the individual subunits have been determined:\n\n- The alpha subunit has an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.0 and a molecular weight (MW) of 25 kDa.\n- The beta subunit has an isoelectric point (pI) of 8.0 and a molecular weight (MW) of 45 kDa.\n\nA purified sample of the intact MAR protein is subjected to standard two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The first dimension is isoelectric focusing (IEF) performed on a strip with a linear pH gradient from 3.0 (left side) to 10.0 (right side). The second dimension is Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), where proteins migrate vertically from top to bottom. In this second dimension, lower molecular weight proteins migrate further down the gel than higher molecular weight proteins.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the pattern of spots that will be observed on the gel?\n\nA. A single spot will be observed, corresponding to the intact tetrameric complex with a molecular weight of 140 kDa.\n\nB. Four distinct spots will be observed, as each of the four individual polypeptide chains will migrate to a unique position on the gel.\n\nC. Two distinct spots will be observed: one at a position corresponding to pI = 6.0 and MW = 25 kDa, and another at a position corresponding to pI = 8.0 and MW = 45 kDa.\n\nD.

Two distinct horizontal bands will be observed, but they will not be resolved in the pH dimension, resulting in spots at the same horizontal position but different vertical positions.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the outcome of a two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis experiment on a heterotetrameric protein, MAR. To solve this, we must understand the principles of each dimension of the separation.\n\nThe first step is to analyze the effect of the experimental conditions on the protein sample. The procedure involves SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) is a powerful anionic detergent that serves two main purposes: it denatures proteins and imparts a uniform negative charge-to-mass ratio. The denaturation process breaks all non-covalent interactions, including those that hold the subunits of a multimeric protein together. Consequently, the MAR heterotetramer (composed of two alpha and two beta subunits) will dissociate into its four individual constituent polypeptide chains: two separate alpha subunits and two separate beta subunits. This means the intact 140 kDa tetramer will not be present during the separation process. Therefore, option A, which suggests a single spot for the intact tetramer, is incorrect.\n\nThe second step is to consider how these individual subunits will be separated on the 2D gel.\n\nThe first dimension is Isoelectric Focusing (IEF). In this dimension, proteins or polypeptides migrate through a stable pH gradient under the influence of an electric field. Each polypeptide chain will move until it reaches a point in the gradient where the pH is equal to its isoelectric point (pI). At this pH, the polypeptide has a net charge of zero and ceases to migrate. This separation is based solely on the pI of the polypeptide.\n- The alpha subunits have a pI of 6.0. They will migrate to and focus at the horizontal position on the gel corresponding to pH 6.0.\n- The beta subunits have a pI of 8.0. They will migrate to and focus at the horizontal position on the gel corresponding to pH 8.0.\nSince the separation in this dimension is purely based on pI, and not on MW, this refutes option E, which incorrectly claims the subunits would not be resolved in the pH dimension.\n\nThe third step is to analyze the separation in the second dimension, which is SDS-PAGE. After IEF, the gel strip is subjected to SDS-PAGE. As established, SDS has already denatured the protein and dissociated the subunits. The SDS also coats each polypeptide chain, giving it a large negative charge that is proportional to its mass. As a result, the intrinsic charge of the polypeptide (related to its pI) becomes negligible, and separation in the electric field is based almost exclusively on size (i.e., molecular weight). The polyacrylamide gel acts as a molecular sieve. Smaller polypeptides navigate the pores of the gel more easily and thus migrate further down the gel than larger polypeptides.\n- The alpha subunits have a MW of 25 kDa.\n- The beta subunits have a MW of 45 kDa.\nThe alpha subunits will migrate further down the gel (to a lower position) than the larger beta subunits.\n\nThe final step is to combine the results from both dimensions to determine the number and coordinates of the spots. A spot on a 2D gel represents a population of identical molecules that have been resolved to a specific pI and MW coordinate.\n- There are two alpha subunits, but they are identical. They both have a pI of 6.0 and a MW of 25 kDa. Therefore, they will co-migrate to the exact same position, forming a single spot at the coordinate (pI = 6.0, MW = 25 kDa).\n- Similarly, the two beta subunits are identical. They both have a pI of 8.0 and a MW of 45 kDa. They will co-migrate to a second, distinct spot at the coordinate (pI = 8.0, MW = 45 kDa).\n\nTherefore, we expect to see exactly two spots on the final gel. This conclusion eliminates option B, which incorrectly suggests that each of the four subunits would create a separate spot. Identical molecules are not resolved from each other and appear as a single spot.\n\nComparing our prediction with the remaining options:\n- Option C states that two spots will be observed: one at (pI = 6.0, MW = 25 kDa) and another at (pI = 8.0, MW = 45 kDa). This perfectly matches our analysis.\n- Option D suggests two spots, but it incorrectly pairs the pI and MW values (pI = 6.0 with MW = 45 kDa, and pI = 8.0 with MW = 25 kDa). This is inconsistent with the properties given for the alpha and beta subunits.\n\nThus, the correct prediction is described in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2116012"}, {"introduction": "Having established that subunits are resolved individually, we now focus on the chemical principles governing their separation. This exercise explores how a protein's primary amino acid sequence directly influences its isoelectric point ($pI$). By comparing two protein isoforms that differ in their content of acidic and basic residues, you will practice predicting their relative positions along the horizontal, pH-driven axis of the gel, reinforcing the connection between protein composition and electrophoretic behavior [@problem_id:2116016].", "problem": "A researcher is studying two newly identified protein isoforms, named Isoform A and Isoform B. Both proteins are determined to have an identical molecular weight of approximately 42 kDa. However, amino acid analysis reveals a key difference in their composition: Isoform A has a significantly higher abundance of lysine residues, while Isoform B has a significantly higher abundance of aspartate residues.\n\nTo visualize and separate these isoforms, the researcher performs a two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis experiment. In this technique, the protein mixture is first separated in the horizontal dimension by Isoelectric Focusing (IEF) across an immobilized pH gradient that ranges from pH 3 (conventionally placed on the left, the acidic end) to pH 10 (on the right, the basic end). Subsequently, the proteins are separated in the vertical dimension by Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), where proteins migrate from top to bottom, with smaller proteins migrating further down.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the relative positions of Isoform A and Isoform B on the final 2D gel?\n\nA. Isoform A will be located towards the acidic end of the gel (left), and Isoform B will be located towards the basic end (right).\n\nB. Both isoforms will migrate to the same horizontal position but will be separated vertically, with one appearing above the other.\n\nC. Both isoforms will appear at approximately the same spot on the gel, as their molecular weights are identical.\n\nD. Isoform A will be located towards the basic end of the gel (right), and Isoform B will be located towards the acidic end (left), both at the same vertical level.\n\nE. Both isoforms will migrate to the same vertical position, but their horizontal positions cannot be determined without more detailed information about their full amino acid sequences.", "solution": "First principle for the first dimension (IEF): In an immobilized pH gradient, each protein migrates under an electric field until it reaches the position where its net charge is zero, i.e., where $pH = pI$. Thus horizontal location is determined by $pI$, with lower $pI$ focusing toward the acidic end (left, lower $pH$) and higher $pI$ toward the basic end (right, higher $pH$):\n$$\n\\text{Focus when } pH = pI.\n$$\n\nEffect of amino acid composition on $pI$: Lysine has a basic side chain (positively charged at neutral $pH$), so an increased abundance of lysine raises the protein’s basicity and thus increases $pI$. Aspartate has an acidic side chain (negatively charged at neutral $pH$), so an increased abundance of aspartate lowers $pI$. Therefore:\n$$\npI_{A} > pI_{B}.\n$$\nConsequently, Isoform A (lysine-rich) will focus farther to the right (basic end), and Isoform B (aspartate-rich) will focus farther to the left (acidic end).\n\nSecond principle for the second dimension (SDS-PAGE): SDS binds to polypeptides approximately in proportion to their length, conferring a nearly constant charge-to-mass ratio. Electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE depends primarily on molecular mass; proteins of the same mass migrate to the same vertical position. Since both isoforms have identical molecular weight (approximately $42$ kDa), their vertical positions will be the same.\n\nCombining both dimensions: Isoform A and Isoform B will separate horizontally according to $pI$ (A to the right, B to the left) while remaining at the same vertical level due to equal molecular weight.

The first dimension of separation is Isoelectric Focusing (IEF), performed on a gel strip with a linear pH gradient from 4 to 7. This step separates proteins based on their isoelectric point (pI). The second dimension is Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), which separates the proteins based on their molecular mass.\n\nAfter staining the final gel, the researcher observes that a specific protein, which is known from previous experiments to be a single polypeptide chain with no post-translational modifications, appears not as a single, tight spot, but as a distinct horizontal streak. This streak indicates that the protein has migrated correctly in the second dimension (consistent molecular mass) but has separated into multiple species across a range of pI values in the first dimension.\n\nAssuming the original protein sample was pure and correct, which of the following common technical artifacts is the most likely explanation for this observation?\n\nA.

A horizontal streak after 2D-PAGE indicates that the protein species have essentially the same apparent molecular mass in SDS-PAGE (no vertical spread) but differ in pI (horizontal spread). For a protein known to be a single polypeptide with no post-translational modifications, this pattern strongly suggests formation of multiple charge variants during sample preparation or the IEF step rather than genuine biological microheterogeneity.\n\nA well-known chemical artifact in IEF buffers is carbamylation, which arises when urea decomposes to cyanate, especially when urea solutions are old or have been overheated. Cyanate reacts with primary amino groups (for example, at the N-terminus and on lysine side chains), converting them to carbamylated derivatives (for example, homocitrulline), thereby reducing positive charge at a given pH and shifting the pI to more acidic values. Because carbamylation can occur to varying extents across protein molecules in the sample, it generates a ladder of species with incrementally shifted pI values. Importantly, these modifications typically do not produce large enough changes in apparent molecular mass under SDS-PAGE to alter the position in the second dimension, so the result is a horizontal streak.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- A (overheating in second-dimension SDS-PAGE) would distort migration vertically (for example, smiling or band distortion), not produce multiple pI species at the same mass.\n- B (poor equilibration of the IEF strip with SDS) leads to incomplete SDS binding and aberrant migration in the second dimension, typically causing vertical streaking or mass-dependent anomalies, not a clean horizontal spread at constant mass.\n- C (improper polyacrylamide gradient in the second dimension) affects resolution by molecular mass and would not create multiple pI species; it would alter vertical separation.\n- D (boiling in sample loading buffer before IEF) introduces SDS before IEF, which interferes with focusing and typically prevents proper IEF or causes vertical smearing in the second dimension rather than multiple discrete pI species at equal mass.\n- E (old or overheated urea) causes cyanate formation and carbamylation, yielding a heterogeneous set of charge variants with unchanged apparent molecular mass in SDS-PAGE, observed as a horizontal streak.\n\nTherefore, the most likely technical artifact is carbamylation due to degraded or overheated urea used for IEF sample preparation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2115992"}]}
