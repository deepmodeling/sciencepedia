It is commonly found in transcription factors and is crucial for their ability to bind to Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). In a typical Cys₂His₂ motif, the Zn$^{2+}$ ion is coordinated by the side chains of four amino acid residues: two cysteines and two histidines.\n\nConsider the process of forming this coordination center. Initially, the four amino acid residues are part of an unstructured polypeptide chain at a physiological pH of 7.0. The side chain of an unbound cysteine has a $pK_a$ of 8.3, and the side chain of an unbound histidine has a $pK_a$ of 6.0. In the final, folded state, the two cysteine side chains are deprotonated to form thiolate anions, and the two histidine side chains remain electrically neutral, all coordinating the central Zn$^{2+}$ ion.\n\nCalculate the net change in the total electrical charge of these four amino acid side chains as they transition from their unbound state at pH 7.0 to their coordinated state within the zinc finger motif.
