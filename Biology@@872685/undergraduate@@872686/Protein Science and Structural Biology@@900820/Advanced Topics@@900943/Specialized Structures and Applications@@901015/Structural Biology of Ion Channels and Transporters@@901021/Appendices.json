This exercise explores this core principle by presenting a thought experiment involving a \"chimeric\" channel. By conceptually combining parts from different channels, you can test your understanding of how distinct structural domains—the voltage sensor and the pore—independently contribute to the channel's overall function, namely its voltage sensitivity and ion selectivity.", "problem": "A team of biophysicists is investigating the modular nature of ion channel domains. They construct a chimeric ion channel by genetically fusing the Voltage-Sensor Domain (VSD) of a typical mammalian voltage-gated sodium channel ($\\text{Na}_\\text{V}$) with the Pore Domain (PD) of a classic voltage-gated potassium channel ($\\text{K}_\\text{V}$). The VSD comprises the first four transmembrane helices (S1-S4) and is responsible for detecting changes in membrane potential. The PD comprises the last two transmembrane helices (S5-S6) and the intervening P-loop, which forms the ion-conduction pathway and the selectivity filter.\n\nThis newly engineered chimeric channel is expressed in a host cell that has no native voltage-gated ion channels. The cell is then studied using patch-clamp electrophysiology. The intracellular solution is maintained with a high concentration of potassium ions and a low concentration of sodium ions, while the extracellular solution has a high concentration of sodium ions and a low concentration of potassium ions, mimicking typical physiological conditions. The membrane is initially held at a hyperpolarized potential of -90 mV and is then subjected to a series of depolarizing voltage steps to +50 mV.\n\nBased on the established principles of ion channel structure and function, which of the following outcomes most accurately describes the expected functional properties of this chimeric channel?\n\nA. The channel is non-functional and exhibits no ion current in response to voltage changes.\n\nB. The channel is voltage-gated, opening upon membrane depolarization, and is selective for Na$^+$ ions.\n\nC. The channel functions as a \"leak\" channel, being constitutively open and allowing a steady flow of ions regardless of membrane voltage, and is selective for K$^+$ ions.\n\nD. The channel is voltage-gated, opening upon membrane depolarization, and is selective for K$^+$ ions.\n\nE. The channel is voltage-gated, opening upon membrane depolarization, but has lost its ionic specificity, becoming a non-selective cation channel.", "solution": "We identify the functional modules and their known biophysical roles. The Voltage-Sensor Domain (VSD; S1–S4) determines voltage dependence of gating, and the Pore Domain (PD; S5–S6 with the P-loop/selectivity filter) determines ion permeation and selectivity. This modularity is well established: VSDs can allosterically gate pores through the S4–S5 linker, and the selectivity filter within the P-loop sets ionic specificity independent of the VSD identity.\n\nVoltage dependence. In a typical $\\text{Na}_{\\text{V}}$, the S4 helix carries positively charged residues that move outward upon depolarization. This movement lowers the free-energy barrier for pore opening. In symbols, the open probability is an increasing function of membrane voltage, $P_{\\text{open}}(V_{m})$, because the gating charge $q$ moved by the VSD couples to the membrane field, changing the open–closed equilibrium by a factor proportional to $\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{q V_{m}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$ in a two-state approximation. Therefore, replacing the $\\text{K}_{\\text{V}}$ VSD with a $\\text{Na}_{\\text{V}}$ VSD preserves voltage-gated opening upon depolarization, provided the mechanical coupling via the S4–S5 linker is retained.\n\nIonic selectivity. The $\\text{K}_{\\text{V}}$ PD contains the canonical TVGYG selectivity filter. Selectivity arises from the geometry and carbonyl coordination in the P-loop, not from the VSD. Thus the chimera’s pore remains selective for $\\text{K}^{+}$ over $\\text{Na}^{+}$.\n\nPredicted currents under the stated ionic and voltage conditions follow from the Nernst equation and Ohmic driving-force form. With intracellular $[\\text{K}^{+}]_{i}$ high and extracellular $[\\text{K}^{+}]_{o}$ low, and the reverse for sodium, the Nernst potentials are\n$$\nE_{\\text{K}}=\\frac{R T}{z F}\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[\\text{K}^{+}]_{o}}{[\\text{K}^{+}]_{i}}\\right),\\quad\nE_{\\text{Na}}=\\frac{R T}{z F}\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[\\text{Na}^{+}]_{o}}{[\\text{Na}^{+}]_{i}}\\right),\n$$\nwith $z=+1$. Under typical conditions, $E_{\\text{K}}$ is negative and $E_{\\text{Na}}$ is positive. Because the pore is $\\text{K}^{+}$-selective, the macroscopic current during depolarizing steps is\n$$\nI_{\\text{K}}=g_{\\text{K}}\\,P_{\\text{open}}(V_{m})\\,[\\,V_{m}-E_{\\text{K}}\\,],\n$$\nwhich is outward when $V_{m}E_{\\text{K}}$. Starting from $V_{m}=-90\\,\\text{mV}$ and stepping to depolarized potentials up to $+50\\,\\text{mV}$ will increase $P_{\\text{open}}(V_{m})$ and produce voltage-activated outward $\\text{K}^{+}$ currents. The channel will not conduct $\\text{Na}^{+}$ significantly because the selectivity filter remains that of a $\\text{K}_{\\text{V}}$ PD.\n\nTherefore:\n- Not A: chimeras of VSD and PD are known to be functional due to modular coupling.\n- Not B: selectivity is set by the PD; a $\\text{K}_{\\text{V}}$ pore is not $\\text{Na}^{+}$-selective.\n- Not C: the presence of a functional VSD implies voltage dependence, not constitutive leak.\n- Not E: the $\\text{K}_{\\text{V}}$ selectivity filter preserves $\\text{K}^{+}$ selectivity; loss of specificity is not expected.\n\nThe most accurate outcome is that the channel is voltage-gated by depolarization and selective for $\\text{K}^{+}$ ions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2139940"}, {"introduction": "From conceptual models, we move to quantitative experimental analysis.
