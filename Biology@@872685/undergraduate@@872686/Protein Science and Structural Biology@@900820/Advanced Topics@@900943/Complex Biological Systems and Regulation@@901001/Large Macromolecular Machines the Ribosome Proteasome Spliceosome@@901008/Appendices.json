This intricate process depends on recognizing key landmarks within the pre-mRNA. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2116518] challenges you to predict the outcome when one of these crucial signals—the branch point sequence—is disabled, testing your understanding of the fundamental chemical mechanism of splicing.", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the process of converting a gene's genetic code into a functional protein involves transcribing Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) into a precursor messenger Ribonucleic Acid (pre-mRNA). This pre-mRNA molecule contains both protein-coding regions, known as exons, and non-coding intervening regions, known as introns. Before this transcript can be translated into a protein, it must undergo a process called splicing, where the introns are precisely removed and the exons are ligated together to form a mature messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA).\n\nThis intricate cutting and pasting task is performed by a large molecular machine called the spliceosome. The spliceosome recognizes specific consensus sequences within the pre-mRNA to identify the boundaries of an intron. These key sequences are:\n1.  The **5' splice site**, located at the 5' end of the intron.\n2.  The **3' splice site**, located at the 3' end of the intron.\n3.  The **branch point sequence**, located within the intron (typically 15-45 nucleotides upstream of the 3' splice site), which contains a critical adenosine (A) nucleotide.\n\nThe splicing reaction proceeds in two main chemical steps. In the first step, the 2'-hydroxyl group of the branch point adenosine acts as a nucleophile, attacking the phosphodiester bond at the 5' splice site. This cleaves the upstream exon from the intron and forms a characteristic lariat-shaped intermediate.\n\nConsider a hypothetical eukaryotic gene that contains two exons (Exon 1 and Exon 2) separated by a single intron. A researcher introduces a point mutation that alters the branch point sequence within this intron so that it is no longer recognized by the spliceosome. All other sequences, including the 5' and 3' splice sites, remain intact and functional.\n\nWhat is the most likely outcome for the final mRNA transcript produced from this mutated gene after it undergoes nuclear processing?\n\nA. The intron will be correctly spliced out, as the 5' and 3' splice sites are sufficient for the spliceosome to recognize and remove the intron.\n\nB. The spliceosome will utilize a random adenosine nucleotide within the intron as a substitute branch point, leading to an unpredictably altered but spliced mRNA.\n\nC. The intron will fail to be excised, resulting in a mature mRNA transcript that contains the entire, unprocessed intron sequence located between Exon 1 and Exon 2.\n\nD. The spliceosome will skip over the intron and the adjacent Exon 2, ligating Exon 1 directly to the next exon downstream in the gene, if one exists.", "solution": "The problem asks to determine the fate of a pre-mRNA transcript when its intron's branch point sequence is mutated and rendered non-functional. To solve this, we must understand the sequential mechanism of splicing in detail.\n\nThe process of splicing, catalyzed by the spliceosome, is a two-step transesterification reaction.\n\nStep 1: The first transesterification reaction.\nThe spliceosome machinery assembles at the intron, recognizing the 5' splice site, the 3' splice site, and the branch point sequence. The first chemical step is initiated by the 2'-hydroxyl group ($2'$-OH) of a specific adenosine nucleotide within the branch point sequence. This $2'$-OH group performs a nucleophilic attack on the phosphodiester bond at the 5' splice site. This attack breaks the bond between the end of the first exon (Exon 1) and the beginning of the intron. A new phosphodiester bond is formed between the 5' end of the intron and the branch point adenosine, creating a looped structure called an intron lariat. The Exon 1 is left with a free 3'-hydroxyl group ($3'$-OH).\n\nStep 2: The second transesterification reaction.\nThe free $3'$-OH group of Exon 1 now acts as a nucleophile, attacking the phosphodiester bond at the 3' splice site (the boundary between the intron and Exon 2). This attack joins Exon 1 and Exon 2 together, forming a continuous coding sequence. Concurrently, the intron is released as a lariat, which is subsequently degraded.\n\nAnalysis of the mutation's effect:\nThe problem states that the branch point sequence is inactivated by a mutation. The branch point adenosine is not merely a recognition site; it is an active chemical participant in the very first catalytic step of splicing. Its $2'$-OH group is the nucleophile that initiates the entire process.\n\nIf the spliceosome cannot recognize the branch point, or if the critical adenosine is altered, the first transesterification reaction cannot occur. The nucleophilic attack on the 5' splice site will fail. Without the successful completion of this first step, the second step (ligation of the exons) cannot be initiated because the necessary nucleophile—the free 3'-OH group of Exon 1—is never generated.\n\nTherefore, the splicing reaction is stalled at its inception for this particular intron. The pre-mRNA molecule may still undergo other processing events like 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation, but the intron will remain within the transcript. The final processed mRNA that is exported to the cytoplasm for translation will be aberrant, containing the sequence of Exon 1, followed by the entire unspliced intron, followed by the sequence of Exon 2.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this understanding:\nA. This is incorrect. The branch point is absolutely essential for the first catalytic step of splicing. The 5' and 3' splice sites alone are not sufficient.\nB. This is less likely to be the primary outcome. While the use of \"cryptic\" splice sites can occur, the question states the canonical branch point is *inactivated*, making a complete failure of the reaction the most direct and highly probable consequence. Random substitution is not the default mechanism.\nC. This correctly describes the consequence of blocking the first step of splicing. The spliceosome fails to catalyze the excision, and the intron is retained in the final mRNA product. This is the most direct and certain outcome.\nD. This describes an event called exon skipping, which is a different type of splicing error. It's not the direct consequence of inactivating a branch point within the adjacent intron. Such an event would typically be caused by mutations that weaken the splice sites flanking the skipped exon.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is the retention of the intron in the final mRNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2116518"}, {"introduction": "Once a mature mRNA is produced, the ribosome takes center stage to translate the genetic code into a polypeptide chain.

To allow for cell division in response to an external stimulus, STA must be degraded. This degradation is initiated when a growth factor binds to its receptor, activating a kinase that phosphorylates a specific serine residue within a phosphodegron motif on STA. This phosphorylation event creates a binding site for a specific F-box protein, which is part of a Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex. The binding of the F-box protein to phosphorylated STA (pSTA) leads to polyubiquitination and subsequent rapid degradation of STA by the 26S proteasome.\n\nThe degradation of pSTA follows first-order kinetics, with a degradation rate constant, $k_{deg}$.
