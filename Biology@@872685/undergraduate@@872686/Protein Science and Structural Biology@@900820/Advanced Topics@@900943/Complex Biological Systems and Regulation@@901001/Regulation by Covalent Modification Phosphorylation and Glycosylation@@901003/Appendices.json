{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The regulation of protein activity by phosphorylation is a highly specific process. Out of thousands of serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues in the proteome, how does a particular kinase select its correct target? This specificity is often achieved through recognition of a short amino acid sequence, or motif, surrounding the phosphorylation site. This exercise provides practice in identifying such a consensus motif, a fundamental skill for predicting and understanding kinase-substrate interactions.

They hypothesize that its activity is regulated by phosphorylation. The primary amino acid sequence of Signalin, written from the N-terminus (position 1) to the C-terminus, is:\n\n`V-D-A-R-K-S-I-G-R-R-L-T-A-P-V-S-E-L`\n\nProtein Kinase A (PKA) is a common enzyme that catalyzes phosphorylation. Its consensus recognition motif is $R\\text{-}R\\text{-}X\\text{-}S/T$, where R is Arginine, X can be any amino acid, and phosphorylation occurs on the Serine (S) or Threonine (T) residue within the motif.\n\nBased on the provided sequence and recognition motif, which of the following residues in Signalin is the most likely target for phosphorylation by PKA?\n\nA. S6\n\nB. R9\n\nC. T12\n\nD.

Phosphorylation occurs on the serine or threonine at position $j+3$ of the motif.\n\nWe scan the sequence for $R\\text{-}R\\text{-}X\\text{-}S/T$:\n- At positions $9$ to $12$, the sequence is $R9\\text{-}R10\\text{-}L11\\text{-}T12$, which matches $R\\text{-}R\\text{-}X\\text{-}T$. Therefore, residue $12$ (T12) is the phosphoacceptor site predicted for PKA.\n- No other consecutive $R\\text{-}R$ pairs appear elsewhere in the sequence, so there are no alternative matches to the consensus motif.\n- Residues S6 and S16 do not satisfy the required preceding $R\\text{-}R\\text{-}X$ pattern, and R9 is not a phosphoacceptor residue.\n\nThus, the most likely PKA phosphorylation site in Signalin is T12, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2133230"}, {"introduction": "Once a potential phosphorylation site is identified, the next critical question is to determine its functional consequence. Site-directed mutagenesis is a powerful tool used to probe the role of a specific amino acid. This thought experiment explores the use of two common types of mutations: a \"phospho-dead\" mutation that prevents phosphorylation, and a \"phosphomimetic\" mutation that mimics the negative charge of a phosphate group. Understanding the outcomes of these mutations is key to deciphering the logic of signaling pathways. [@problem_id:2133240]", "problem": "An enzyme, named \"Catalytic Regulator of Apoptosis\" (CRA), plays a crucial role in a cell signaling pathway. In its basal, non-phosphorylated state, CRA is inactive. The activity of CRA is switched on when a specific kinase phosphorylates a single regulatory serine residue at position 85 (Ser-85). This phosphorylation event induces a conformational change that activates the enzyme.\n\nTo investigate the function of CRA, a researcher genetically engineers two distinct populations of cells. Each population expresses a different mutant form of the CRA protein instead of the wild-type version.\n- **Mutant A**: The serine residue at position 85 has been replaced by an alanine residue.\n- **Mutant B**: The serine residue at position 85 has been replaced by a glutamate residue.\n\nAssuming the mutations do not affect protein folding stability or expression levels, and that the activating kinase is present and functional in both cell populations, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected catalytic activity of the CRA enzyme in these cells?\n\nA. The CRA from Mutant A will be constitutively active, while the CRA from Mutant B will be permanently inactive.\n\nB. The CRA from both Mutant A and Mutant B will be permanently inactive.\n\nC. The CRA from both Mutant A and Mutant B will be regulated by the kinase in the same manner as the wild-type protein.\n\nD. The CRA from Mutant A will be permanently inactive, while the CRA from Mutant B will be constitutively active.\n\nE. The CRA from Mutant A will have normal, regulated activity, while the CRA from Mutant B will be constitutively active.", "solution": "The stated regulatory mechanism is that CRA is inactive when unphosphorylated and becomes active upon phosphorylation of Ser-85 by a kinase. This implies that the hydroxyl group of serine at position 85 is required as the substrate for phosphorylation, and that the resulting phosphate introduces a negative charge that stabilizes an active conformation.\n\nFor Mutant A (S85A), serine is replaced by alanine. Alanine lacks the hydroxyl group required for phosphorylation by a serine/threonine kinase. Therefore, the kinase cannot phosphorylate position 85 in this mutant. Without the phosphate, the activating negative charge and the associated conformational switch cannot occur, so CRA remains in its basal inactive state irrespective of kinase presence. Hence, Mutant A is predicted to be permanently inactive.\n\nFor Mutant B (S85E), serine is replaced by glutamate. Glutamate carries a constitutive negative charge at physiological pH and is commonly used as a phosphomimetic substitution to mimic the effect of phosphorylation. This negative charge at position 85 can stabilize the active conformation even without actual phosphorylation by the kinase, leading to activity independent of kinase regulation. Therefore, Mutant B is predicted to be constitutively active.\n\nComparing these outcomes to the provided choices, the description that matches is that Mutant A is permanently inactive, while Mutant B is constitutively active.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2133240"}, {"introduction": "Beyond phosphorylation, glycosylation—the attachment of sugar chains—is another widespread covalent modification that dramatically impacts protein properties. N-linked glycosylation, in particular, adds substantial mass to a polypeptide, altering its behavior in common analytical techniques.
