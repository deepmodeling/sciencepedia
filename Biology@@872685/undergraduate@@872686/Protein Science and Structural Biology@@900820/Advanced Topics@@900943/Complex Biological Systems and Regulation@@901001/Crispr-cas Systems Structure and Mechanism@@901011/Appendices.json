This exercise provides hands-on practice with the fundamental first step of any CRISPR experiment: analyzing a DNA sequence to locate a valid PAM and then designing the precise crRNA sequence required to guide the Cas9 nuclease to that target for cleavage [@problem_id:2106309]. Mastering this process is essential for programming the system to edit any gene of interest.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is designing a gene-editing experiment using the CRISPR-Cas9 system from *Streptococcus pyogenes* (SpCas9). The SpCas9 nuclease is guided to a specific DNA locus by a short CRISPR RNA (crRNA), and its binding is dependent on the presence of a Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). For SpCas9, the required PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3', where 'N' can be any deoxyribonucleotide. This PAM sequence must be located on the \"non-target\" DNA strand (the strand that does not bind to the crRNA) immediately downstream (at the 3' end) of the 20-nucleotide DNA sequence known as the protospacer.\n\nThe researcher has identified the following double-stranded DNA segment from the gene of interest:\n\n5'-GATTACAGATTACAAGTCATCGATGCGTACGTCACGGCTAGCATGC-3'\n3'-CTAATGTCTAATGTTCAGTAGCTACGCATGCAGTGCCGATCGTACG-5'\n\nTo successfully target a site within this segment, the researcher must synthesize a crRNA containing a 20-nucleotide spacer sequence. Identify the single valid SpCas9 target site within this DNA segment and determine the corresponding 20-nucleotide crRNA spacer sequence required to direct Cas9 to this location. Your answer should be the RNA sequence written in the 5' to 3' direction.", "solution": "The SpCas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes requires a 5'-NGG-3' PAM on the non-target DNA strand immediately 3' of the 20-nucleotide protospacer. To find valid target sites, we scan both strands for a PAM and check that a full 20-nucleotide protospacer lies immediately upstream (in the 5' direction) on the same strand.\n\nFirst, scan the given top strand (5' to 3') for 5'-NGG-3'. The sequence is:\n5'-GATTACAGATTACAAGTCATCGATGCGTACGTCACGGCTAGCATGC-3'\n\nThe only occurrence of 'GG' on the top strand is at positions 36–37, giving the PAM 5'-CGG-3' at positions 35–37. This leaves exactly 20 nucleotides immediately upstream on the same strand (positions 15–34), which are:\nAGTCATCGATGCGTACGTCA\n\nNext, verify that there is no valid PAM on the bottom strand. An NGG on the bottom strand corresponds to a CCN on the top strand. Scanning the top strand shows no 'CC' dinucleotide, so there is no 5'-NGG-3' PAM on the bottom strand with a valid 20-nucleotide upstream protospacer within the segment. Therefore, the site identified on the top strand is unique within the given sequence.\n\nSince the PAM is on the non-target strand (the top strand here), the crRNA spacer that base-pairs with the target strand is identical to the 20-nucleotide sequence upstream of the PAM on the non-target strand, with uracils replacing thymines.

This thought experiment explores the consequences of inactivating one of these domains, revealing the basis for engineered \"nickases\" that cut only one DNA strand [@problem_id:2106329]. Understanding this modular function is key to appreciating how scientists have repurposed Cas9 for a variety of genomic manipulations beyond simple knockout.", "problem": "The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system is a powerful tool for genome engineering, functioning as a programmable deoxyribonuclease. The Cas9 protein from *Streptococcus pyogenes* is directed to a specific target DNA sequence by a guide RNA (gRNA). Upon binding, Cas9 introduces a double-strand break (DSB) in the target DNA. This cleavage is performed by two distinct nuclease domains within the Cas9 protein: the HNH domain and the RuvC-like domain. The HNH domain is responsible for cleaving the target strand (the DNA strand that is complementary to the gRNA sequence), while the RuvC domain cleaves the non-target strand (the DNA strand that does not base-pair with the gRNA). The catalytic activity of both domains is required to create a DSB.\n\nA researcher is investigating the catalytic mechanism of the RuvC domain. It is known that a specific aspartate residue (an acidic amino acid) in the active site of the RuvC domain is critical for its nuclease activity. The researcher constructs a mutant Cas9 protein where this single critical aspartate residue is replaced by an alanine residue (a small, non-polar amino acid). This mutant Cas9 protein is then assembled with a functional gRNA and introduced into a test system containing the intended target DNA sequence.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the functional outcome of this specific mutation?\n\nA. The mutant Cas9 protein will be unable to bind to its target DNA sequence.\n\nB. The mutant Cas9 protein will bind to the target DNA and generate a double-strand break, exhibiting activity identical to the wild-type protein.\n\nC. The mutant Cas9 protein will bind to the target DNA and cleave only the target strand, resulting in a single-strand break (a nick).\n\nD. The mutant Cas9 protein will bind to the target DNA and cleave only the non-target strand, resulting in a single-strand break (a nick).\n\nE. The mutation will cause the Cas9 protein to lose its specificity and cleave DNA at random locations throughout the genome.", "solution": "Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage requires both nuclease domains: the HNH domain cleaves the target strand (complementary to the gRNA), and the RuvC-like domain cleaves the non-target strand. A double-strand break is produced only if both domains are catalytically active.\n\nA single critical aspartate in the RuvC active site is essential for catalysis because its carboxylate side chain coordinates divalent metal ions and participates in the catalytic mechanism typical of RNase H-like nucleases. Substituting this aspartate with alanine removes the acidic side chain necessary for metal ion coordination and acid-base catalysis, thereby abolishing the RuvC nuclease activity.\n\nDNA target recognition and binding are driven by PAM recognition and RNA-DNA base pairing, which are structurally and functionally distinct from the RuvC catalytic residues. Therefore, mutating the RuvC catalytic aspartate is not expected to prevent DNA binding.\n\nWith RuvC inactivated and HNH intact, the enzyme will bind the target DNA and only the HNH domain will cleave, producing a nick in the target strand. The non-target strand will not be cleaved because the RuvC domain is catalytically inactive. This is consistent with the well-characterized Cas9 D10A nickase, where the RuvC active-site Asp to Ala mutation yields target-strand nicking only.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because binding remains intact.\n- B is incorrect because loss of RuvC activity prevents a double-strand break.\n- C is correct: the enzyme binds and cleaves only the target strand via HNH, yielding a nick.\n- D is incorrect because the mutated RuvC cannot cleave the non-target strand.\n- E is incorrect because specificity is governed by gRNA and PAM, not by the RuvC catalytic Asp.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2106329"}, {"introduction": "Effective gene editing requires understanding not only the mechanics of CRISPR-Cas9 but also the fundamental principles of gene expression. This practice problem challenges you to connect the molecular event of DNA cleavage to its ultimate biological outcome on the final protein product [@problem_id:2311240]. It highlights why the choice of target site within a gene's architecture—specifically, whether to target an exon or an intron—is critical for achieving a successful gene knockout.", "problem": "A molecular biology student is learning about gene editing and is designing a theoretical experiment to generate a non-functional, or \"knockout,\" version of a specific protein in a eukaryotic cell line. The standard strategy for this involves using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. This system uses a guide RNA (gRNA) to direct the Cas9 nuclease to a specific target sequence in the cell's genomic DNA, where Cas9 creates a double-strand break. The cell's primary repair mechanism for such breaks, Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), is error-prone and frequently introduces small insertions or deletions (indels) at the break site. If an indel that is not a multiple of three base pairs occurs within a protein-coding region (an exon), it causes a frameshift mutation, typically leading to a premature stop codon and the production of a truncated, non-functional protein.\n\nThe student identifies the target gene, which consists of several exons separated by introns. They propose targeting a sequence in the middle of a large intron, far from any exon-intron boundaries. Assuming the CRISPR-Cas9 machinery successfully generates an indel at this intronic location, which of the following statements best explains why this strategy is highly unlikely to result in a knockout of the final protein product?\n\nA. The Cas9 nuclease can only cleave DNA within exons; it cannot access the more tightly compacted DNA structure of introns.\n\nB. Guide RNAs are designed to bind to messenger RNA (mRNA), not genomic DNA, and introns are not present in the final mRNA.\n\nC. An indel within an intron, while present in the initial RNA transcript, is typically removed during the process of RNA splicing, resulting in a mature mRNA that is identical to the wild-type and thus produces a functional protein.\n\nD. The protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, which is required for Cas9 recognition and cleavage, is only found in the exon regions of genes.\n\nE. Any mutation occurring within an intron is automatically and perfectly corrected by a specialized DNA repair pathway that does not operate on exons.", "solution": "We start from the core mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9 gene disruption in eukaryotic cells. A guide RNA (gRNA) directs the Cas9 nuclease to a complementary genomic DNA sequence adjacent to a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), where Cas9 introduces a double-strand break. The predominant repair pathway in many cells, Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), is error-prone and frequently generates small insertions or deletions (indels) at the break site. Within a protein-coding exon, indels that are not multiples of three nucleotides disrupt the reading frame (frameshift), commonly leading to premature termination codons and a truncated, non-functional protein.\n\nNext, consider the genomic organization of eukaryotic genes. Coding sequences (exons) are interspersed with non-coding sequences (introns). Transcription produces a primary transcript (pre-mRNA) that contains both exons and introns. During RNA processing, introns are removed by the spliceosome, and exons are ligated to form the mature mRNA. Consequently, sequence changes confined to introns that do not disrupt essential splicing signals (canonical splice donor/acceptor sites, branch point, polypyrimidine tract) or critical intronic regulatory elements typically do not alter the mature mRNA sequence. Therefore, if a CRISPR-induced indel is introduced in the middle of a large intron, far from exon-intron boundaries and key splicing motifs, the altered intronic sequence will be excised during splicing, yielding a mature mRNA that is effectively identical to wild-type. As a result, the translated protein remains functional, and a knockout is highly unlikely.\n\nNow assess the options:\n- Option A is incorrect. Cas9 can target accessible DNA throughout the genome, including intronic regions; there is no intrinsic restriction to exons. DNA accessibility is governed by chromatin state, not exon versus intron identity per se.\n- Option B is incorrect. gRNAs base-pair with genomic DNA at the target locus (adjacent to a PAM) to direct Cas9; they are not designed to bind mRNA. While mature mRNA lacks introns, that fact is irrelevant because CRISPR-Cas9 acts on DNA, not mRNA.\n- Option C is correct. An indel within an intron that is far from splice sites will be present in the pre-mRNA but removed during splicing, resulting in a mature mRNA identical to the wild-type and a functional protein.\n- Option D is incorrect. PAM sequences are widely distributed across the genome and are not restricted to exons.\n- Option E is incorrect. There is no specialized, perfect DNA repair pathway that selectively corrects intronic mutations and not exonic ones.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is that intronic indels distant from splicing determinants are spliced out and do not affect the mature mRNA or the final protein product, matching Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2311240"}]}
