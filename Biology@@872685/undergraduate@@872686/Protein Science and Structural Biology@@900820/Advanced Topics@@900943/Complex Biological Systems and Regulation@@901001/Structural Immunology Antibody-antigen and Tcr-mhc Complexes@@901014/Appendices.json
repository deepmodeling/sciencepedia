The interaction between a T-cell and an antigen-presenting cell hinges on the precise fit of a peptide within the groove of an MHC molecule. This exercise challenges you to apply a set of biophysical rules to determine how a specific peptide docks into a hypothetical MHC molecule, highlighting the crucial role of anchor residues in defining immune recognition [@problem_id:2140186].", "problem": "In human adaptive immunity, Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules present short peptide fragments to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. The binding of a peptide to the MHC groove is a highly specific process, primarily dictated by a few \"anchor residues\" within the peptide whose side chains fit into corresponding pockets in the MHC molecule.\n\nConsider a hypothetical Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA), designated HLA-Z*01:01. Structural analysis reveals the key characteristics of its peptide-binding pockets:\n- **Pocket B**, which accommodates the side chain of the peptide's second residue (P2), is deep and lined with nonpolar amino acids, showing a strong preference for large, aromatic side chains (such as Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, or Tryptophan).\n- **Pocket F**, which accommodates the side chain of the peptide's C-terminal residue (PΩ), has a distinct hydrophobic character and is sized to best accommodate a medium-sized, aliphatic side chain (such as Leucine or Isoleucine).\n\nYou are given a nine-amino-acid viral peptide with the following sequence (from N-terminus to C-terminus):\n`Arg-Tyr-Leu-Gly-Glu-Pro-Ser-Val-Leu`\n\nBased on the described properties of the HLA-Z*01:01 binding pockets, identify the pair of amino acids from the peptide that most likely serve as the primary anchor residues by fitting into the B and F pockets, respectively.\n\nA.

For class I molecules, the canonical primary anchors typically occur at the second residue (P2) for pocket B and at the C-terminal residue ($P\\Omega$) for pocket F.\n\nMap the peptide positions:\n- The peptide sequence is Arg (P1), Tyr (P2), Leu (P3), Gly (P4), Glu (P5), Pro (P6), Ser (P7), Val (P8), Leu (P9).\n- Pocket B accommodates P2 and favors large, aromatic side chains (Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, Tryptophan).\n- Pocket F accommodates the C-terminal residue ($P\\Omega$), here P9, and favors medium-sized aliphatic side chains (Leucine, Isoleucine).\n\nEvaluate residue compatibility:\n- At P2, the residue is Tyrosine, which is large and aromatic, matching the preference of pocket B.\n- At P9 (the C-terminus, $P\\Omega$), the residue is Leucine, which is a medium-sized aliphatic side chain, matching the preference of pocket F.\n\nCheck alternatives to exclude:\n- Any option using P1 for pocket B is incompatible because pocket B takes P2.\n- Any option using P8 for pocket F is incompatible because pocket F binds the C-terminal residue at P9.\n- Any option placing Leucine at P3 as a primary anchor for pocket B is incorrect because pocket B is specific for P2 and prefers aromatic residues, not aliphatic Leucine.\n\nTherefore, the primary anchor residues are Tyrosine at P2 (pocket B) and Leucine at P9 (pocket F), which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2140186"}, {"introduction": "The specificity of antibody-antigen interactions is not merely a geometric puzzle; it is a matter of energetic stability, dictated by precise biophysical forces. A single mutation in a pathogen can disrupt a key interaction, rendering an antibody ineffective. In this final practice, you will analyze how a specific point mutation abolishes antibody binding by targeting a critical electrostatic interaction, providing a direct link between protein sequence, 3D structure, and biological function [@problem_id:2140211].", "problem": "A team of virologists is studying the interaction between a novel monoclonal antibody, mAb-2B7, and a specific epitope on the Hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein of the Aurelian Flu Virus (AFV). Structural analysis of the antibody-antigen complex reveals that the binding is primarily stabilized by a small number of key interactions within the antibody's Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs).\n\nThe most critical interaction for binding affinity is a salt bridge formed between the side chain of Arginine at position 98 (Arg-98) on the antibody's heavy chain and the side chain of Aspartic Acid at position 124 (Asp-124) on the viral HE protein. A secondary, less critical interaction involves a hydrogen bond between a Glutamine on the antibody and a Tyrosine on the HE protein at a different location within the epitope.\n\nResearchers discover a new, antibody-resistant strain of AFV. Sequencing reveals a single point mutation in the HE protein gene, resulting in the substitution of Aspartic Acid at position 124 with an Alanine (a D124A mutation). Experimental assays confirm that mAb-2B7 can no longer bind to the HE protein of this new strain.\n\nAssuming the antibody mAb-2B7 remains unchanged, what is the primary biophysical reason for the abolition of mAb-2B7 binding to the mutated HE protein?\n\nA. The mutation eliminates a critical electrostatic interaction (salt bridge) between the epitope and the antibody's CDR.\n\nB. The larger side chain of Alanine compared to Aspartic Acid introduces a steric clash that prevents the antibody from docking correctly.\n\nC. The mutation disrupts a network of stabilizing hydrogen bonds involving the residue at position 124.\n\nD. The mutation causes a global conformational change in the entire HE protein, which indirectly alters the shape of the epitope.\n\nE. The mutation replaces a polar residue with a non-polar one, causing the epitope to be buried in the hydrophobic core of the protein.", "solution": "We are told the highest-affinity interaction is a salt bridge between Arg-98 on the antibody and Asp-124 on the HE protein epitope. A salt bridge is a strong electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged side chains. In this case, the guanidinium group of arginine carries a positive charge and the carboxylate of aspartate carries a negative charge. The dominant physical principle is Coulombic attraction, with pairwise interaction energy scaling as\n$$\nE_{\\text{Coul}} \\propto \\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{4\\pi \\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon_{r} r},\n$$\nwhere $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ are the charges of the interacting groups, $r$ is their separation, and $\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon_{r}$ accounts for the dielectric environment. The D124A mutation replaces a negatively charged aspartate ($q_{2}<0$) with a neutral alanine ($q_{2}\\approx 0$), thereby eliminating this favorable electrostatic term.\n\nThe overall binding free energy can be represented as a sum of contributions,\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{electrostatic}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{H-bond}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{vdW}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{desolvation}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{conformational}} + \\cdots.\n$$\nBecause the salt bridge was identified as the critical stabilizing interaction, the D124A mutation removes a major favorable $\\Delta G_{\\text{electrostatic}}$ contribution. The secondary hydrogen bond (between a glutamine and a tyrosine at a different epitope location) remains unchanged and is insufficient to compensate for the loss of the salt bridge, consistent with the observed abolition of binding.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is correct: replacing Asp with Ala at position 124 removes the negative charge and thus abolishes the salt bridge with Arg-98, eliminating the dominant electrostatic attraction.\n- B is incorrect: alanine has a smaller side chain than aspartic acid; it does not introduce a steric clash and, if anything, creates a small cavity rather than hindrance.\n- C is not the primary reason: while Asp can participate in hydrogen bonding, the problem states the critical interaction is the salt bridge; the secondary hydrogen bond mentioned is at a different site and is less critical.\n- D is unlikely: a single conservative-to-nonpolar surface mutation rarely induces a global conformational change of the entire protein; the observed effect is better explained by the direct loss of the key contact.\n- E is not the main effect: substituting a surface polar residue with alanine does not generally cause the entire epitope to bury in the hydrophobic core; the immediate and sufficient cause for loss of binding is the loss of charge and thus the salt bridge.\n\nTherefore, the primary biophysical reason is the elimination of the critical electrostatic salt bridge interaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2140211"}]}
