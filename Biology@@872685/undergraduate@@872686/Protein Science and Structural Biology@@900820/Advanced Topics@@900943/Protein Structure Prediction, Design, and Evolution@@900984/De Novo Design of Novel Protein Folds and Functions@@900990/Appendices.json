To characterize its folding and stability, the team conducted a thermal denaturation experiment monitored by Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The molar ellipticity at 222 nm, $[\\theta]_{222}$, was used to track the loss of alpha-helical secondary structure as a function of temperature.\n\nThe experiment revealed a fully reversible thermal transition with the following characteristics:\n- The melting temperature, $T_m$, defined as the temperature at which the protein is 50% unfolded, was found to be $60.0 \\text{ °C}$.\n- The transition from the folded state to the unfolded state was notably broad, spanning a wide temperature range.\n- The slope of the fraction of unfolded protein, $f_U$, with respect to temperature, $T$, evaluated at the melting temperature, $(\\frac{d f_U}{dT})_{T=T_m}$, was determined to be $0.0200 \\text{ K}^{-1}$.\n\nThe cooperativity of a two-state folding transition can be quantified by the van't Hoff enthalpy, $\\Delta H_{\\text{vH}}$, which is related to the steepness of the denaturation curve at $T_m$ by the equation:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{vH}} = 4 R T_m^2 \\left( \\frac{d f_U}{dT} \\right)_{T=T_m} $$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $R = 8.314 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1}$, and $T_m$ is in Kelvin.

Artichorin exhibits highly cooperative, two-state folding, characteristic of a smooth folding energy landscape. Its van't Hoff enthalpy is approximately $370 \\text{ kJ/mol}$.\n\nB. The broad transition indicates that Artichorin is irreversibly aggregating upon heating, a common failure mode for designed proteins, which invalidates the concept of a folding energy landscape.\n\nC. Artichorin displays low folding cooperativity, suggesting a rugged folding energy landscape with significantly populated intermediate states. Its van't Hoff enthalpy is approximately $74 \\text{ kJ/mol}$.\n\nD. The CD data suggests that Artichorin lacks a stable folded structure even at low temperatures and exists as a random coil across the entire temperature range. The calculated van't Hoff enthalpy is thus physically meaningless.\n\nE. Artichorin shows high thermodynamic stability due to its broad melting transition. This is consistent with a highly cooperative folding mechanism and a van't Hoff enthalpy of approximately $150 \\text{ kJ/mol}$.", "solution": "The goal is to interpret the provided experimental data for the designed protein Artichorin and select the most accurate description of its folding properties from the given options. This involves both a qualitative interpretation of the broad denaturation curve and a quantitative calculation of the van't Hoff enthalpy.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the qualitative information. The problem states that the thermal denaturation transition is \"notably broad.\" In protein folding, the sharpness of the melting curve is a direct measure of the cooperativity of the unfolding transition. A sharp, sigmoidal curve indicates high cooperativity, where the protein molecule transitions from a predominantly folded state to a predominantly unfolded state over a narrow temperature range. This is often described as an \"all-or-none\" or two-state transition (Folded $\\rightleftharpoons$ Unfolded). Conversely, a broad transition indicates low cooperativity. This suggests that the unfolding process is not a simple two-state event. Instead, there are likely one or more thermodynamically stable intermediate states that become populated as the temperature increases. This corresponds to a \"rugged\" folding energy landscape, where, in addition to the global minimum of the native state, there are other local minima corresponding to these intermediate states.\n\nSecond, let's perform the quantitative analysis by calculating the van't Hoff enthalpy, $\\Delta H_{\\text{vH}}$, which quantifies the cooperativity. The formula is given as:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{vH}} = 4 R T_m^2 \\left( \\frac{d f_U}{dT} \\right)_{T=T_m} $$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Ideal gas constant, $R = 8.314 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1}$.\n- Melting temperature, $T_m = 60.0 \\text{ °C}$. We must convert this to Kelvin: $T_m(\\text{K}) = 60.0 + 273.15 = 333.15 \\text{ K}$.\n- Slope of the fraction unfolded at $T_m$, $(\\frac{d f_U}{dT})_{T=T_m} = 0.0200 \\text{ K}^{-1}$. The small value of this slope is the mathematical representation of the \"broad\" transition.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the equation:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{vH}} = 4 \\times (8.314 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (333.15 \\text{ K})^2 \\times (0.0200 \\text{ K}^{-1}) $$\nFirst, calculate the square of the temperature:\n$$ (333.15 \\text{ K})^2 = 110989.2225 \\text{ K}^2 $$\nNow, multiply all the terms:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{vH}} = 4 \\times 8.314 \\times 110989.2225 \\times 0.0200 \\text{ J/mol} $$\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{vH}} = 73824.9 \\text{ J/mol} $$\nTo compare this with the typical range given in the problem (200-500 kJ/mol), we convert our result to kJ/mol:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{vH}} = \\frac{73824.9}{1000} \\text{ kJ/mol} \\approx 73.8 \\text{ kJ/mol} $$\nThis calculated value is significantly lower than the typical range for cooperatively folding proteins, which quantitatively confirms the interpretation of low cooperativity.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the given options:\n- **A:** Claims high cooperativity and calculates $\\Delta H_{\\text{vH}} \\approx 370 \\text{ kJ/mol}$. This is incorrect. The broad curve indicates low cooperativity, and our calculation confirms a low $\\Delta H_{\\text{vH}}$.\n- **B:** Suggests irreversible aggregation. The problem explicitly states the transition was \"fully reversible,\" so this option is incorrect.\n- **C:** Claims low folding cooperativity, a rugged energy landscape with intermediates, and calculates $\\Delta H_{\\text{vH}} \\approx 74 \\text{ kJ/mol}$. This matches both our qualitative interpretation and our quantitative calculation.\n- **D:** Claims the protein lacks a stable folded structure. This contradicts the CD experiment, which shows a transition from a structured state (implied by monitoring ellipticity at 222 nm, which tracks alpha-helices) to an unfolded state. A transition would not be observed if the protein were always a random coil.\n- **E:** Confuses a broad transition with high thermodynamic stability and incorrectly suggests high cooperativity. A broad transition means low cooperativity. The calculation of $\\Delta H_{\\text{vH}} \\approx 150 \\text{ kJ/mol}$ is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2107610"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate ambition of de novo design often extends beyond creating a stable fold to engineering a specific function, such as binding a target molecule.

Consider the task of designing a novel protein that serves as a specific sensor for Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) but does not bind its precursor, Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP). The sole structural difference between these molecules is that ATP possesses a terminal (gamma) phosphate group which is absent in ADP.\n\nThe design process utilizes two core principles:\n1.  **Positive Design**: Engineering stabilizing interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds, salt bridges) between the protein and the desired target ligand (ATP) to achieve high affinity.\n2.  **Negative Design**: Engineering destabilizing interactions (e.g., steric clashes, electrostatic repulsion) that specifically penalize the binding of undesired, competing ligands (ADP).\n\nAn effective strategy must integrate both principles. Which of the following proposed design strategies for the protein's binding pocket is most likely to achieve high affinity for ATP and high specificity against ADP?\n\nA. Maximize the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors and positive charges (e.g., Lysine, Arginine) throughout the binding pocket to create an extremely high overall affinity for the phosphate groups present in ATP.\n\nB. Introduce several negatively charged residues (e.g., Aspartate, Glutamate) into the binding pocket, positioned to create a general electrostatic repulsion field against the negatively charged phosphate backbone of any nucleotide, but engineer a single, highly specific pocket for the adenine base.\n\nC. Position a positively charged residue (e.g., Arginine) to form a salt bridge specifically with the gamma-phosphate of ATP. Simultaneously, place a negatively charged residue (e.g., Aspartate) nearby such that it forms a stabilizing intra-protein salt bridge with the Arginine when ATP is bound, but would be forced into close, repulsive proximity with the beta-phosphate of ADP if ADP were to bind.\n\nD. Engineer a deep, rigid pocket that perfectly fits the adenosine and ribose moieties. For the phosphate-binding region, introduce a large, non-polar residue (e.g., Tryptophan) that would sterically occupy the space where the gamma-phosphate of ATP would bind, thereby preventing ATP binding but allowing ADP to fit.\n\nE.

It lacks negative design and risks promiscuity for other polyphosphates.\nB. Introducing a general negative electrostatic field repels phosphate groups of both ATP and ADP, increasing both binding free energies similarly, while only a single adenine pocket provides specificity unrelated to the $\\gamma$-phosphate. This reduces affinity and does not create a large positive $\\Delta\\Delta G$ favoring ATP.\nC.
