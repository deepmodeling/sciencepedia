A homologous protein structure is used as a search model. After the MR search, two promising solutions, Solution A and Solution B, are identified. Both solutions have a nearly identical initial Translation Function Z-score (TFZ) of 8.5, making it difficult to distinguish them purely on the search statistics. The primary difference between the two solutions is the placement of the molecule within the unit cell, resulting in distinct crystal packing arrangements.\n\nTo break the ambiguity, an initial, brief round of rigid-body refinement is performed independently for both solutions against the experimental diffraction data. A randomly selected subset of 5% of the total reflections was set aside as a \"free\" set, which was not used during the refinement calculations. The quality of the fit between the model and the data is assessed using two metrics: the working R-factor ($R_{work}$), calculated for the 95% of reflections used in refinement, and the free R-factor ($R_{free}$), calculated for the 5% of \"free\" reflections. The results are as follows:\n\n*   **Solution A:** $R_{work} = 0.350$, $R_{free} = 0.365$\n*   **Solution B:** $R_{work} = 0.345$, $R_{free} = 0.480$\n\nBased on these refinement statistics, which of the following statements provides the most accurate assessment of the situation?\n\nA. Solution B is correct because it has a lower $R_{work}$, indicating a better fit to the majority of the data.\n\nB. Solution A is correct because the difference between its $R_{free}$ and $R_{work}$ is much smaller than for Solution B, indicating less overfitting.\n\nC. Both solutions are incorrect because both $R_{free}$ values are too high, and a new search model should be used.\n\nD. The comparison is inconclusive; more extensive refinement is required before any conclusion can be drawn.\n\nE. Solution B is correct because a lower $R_{work}$ is always the primary indicator of a correct model, regardless of the $R_{free}$ value.", "solution": "Define the crystallographic R-factor for a given set of reflections as\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\sum_{h} \\left|\\,|F_{obs}(h)| - |F_{calc}(h)|\\,\\right|}{\\sum_{h} |F_{obs}(h)|},\n$$\nwhere the sum runs over the specified set of reflections, $|F_{obs}|$ are observed structure factor amplitudes, and $|F_{calc}|$ are calculated amplitudes from the model. The working R-factor $R_{work}$ is computed over the working (refinement) set, and the free R-factor $R_{free}$ is computed over the disjoint free set reserved for cross-validation.\n\nCross-validation principle: when comparing alternative models refined against the same data with an identical free set, $R_{free}$ is the unbiased indicator of model quality. A small gap $\\Delta R = R_{free} - R_{work}$ indicates limited overfitting, whereas a large gap indicates substantial overfitting or model bias. Between competing MR solutions, the one with lower $R_{free}$ and a smaller $\\Delta R$ is generally preferred.\n\nCompute the overfitting gaps for each solution:\n$$\n\\Delta R_{A} = R_{free}^{(A)} - R_{work}^{(A)} = 0.365 - 0.350 = 0.015,\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta R_{B} = R_{free}^{(B)} - R_{work}^{(B)} = 0.480 - 0.345 = 0.135.\n$$\nSolution A has both a markedly lower $R_{free}$ (0.365 versus 0.480) and a much smaller $\\Delta R$ (0.015 versus 0.135). The lower $R_{work}$ of Solution B does not outweigh its much worse $R_{free}$ and large gap, which indicates overfitting to the working set and poor generalization to unseen data. Therefore, Solution A is the better and likely correct placement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because $R_{work}$ alone is not decisive. Option C is not supported because an $R_{free}$ near 0.365 after brief rigid-body refinement is plausible for an initial MR solution, and the relative comparison clearly favors Solution A. Option D is unnecessary here because the cross-validated metrics already distinguish the solutions.

The second derivative (PH2) is prepared similarly using a platinum compound.

While strong, specific binding is ideal, some locations can systematically eliminate the very phasing information you seek to obtain. This challenging problem [@problem_id:2119560] explores the consequences of heavy atoms binding to a 'special position' on a crystallographic symmetry axis, revealing how this seemingly good outcome can render a derivative useless for phasing certain reflections.", "problem": "A protein crystallographer is working to determine the structure of a novel enzyme using the method of Multiple Isomorphous Replacement (MIR). The native protein crystallizes in the tetragonal space group $P4/m$. For this space group, a general coordinate $(x, y, z)$ implies the existence of seven other symmetry-related positions in the unit cell. To obtain phase information, a heavy-atom derivative is prepared by soaking the crystal in a solution containing a mercury compound. After data collection, analysis of the Patterson map indicates that the mercury atoms have bound exclusively to the Wyckoff special position set '2e'. This special position lies on the 4-fold rotation axis and forces the heavy atoms to occupy only two positions within the unit cell, with fractional coordinates $(0, 0, z_H)$ and $(0, 0, -z_H)$. Let the atomic scattering factor for the mercury atom be denoted as $f_H$.\n\nUpon analyzing the diffraction data from the derivative crystal, the crystallographer makes a crucial observation: the heavy-atom derivative provides absolutely no phasing information for any reflection $(h,k,l)$ where the Miller index $l$ is an odd integer. This is because the heavy-atom structure factor contribution, $F_H$, is systematically zero for this entire class of reflections. Given this experimental observation, determine the specific fractional coordinate $z_H$ of the mercury atom. Your answer should be a single numerical value, constrained by the crystallographic convention that $0 < z_H \\le 1/2$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the fractional coordinate $z_H$ of a heavy atom, given that its contribution to the structure factor, $F_H$, is zero for all reflections where the Miller index $l$ is odd. The protein crystallizes in the space group $P4/m$, and the heavy atoms are located at the special positions $(0, 0, z_H)$ and $(0, 0, -z_H)$ within the unit cell.\n\nFirst, we must derive the expression for the heavy-atom structure factor, $F_H(hkl)$. The general formula for the structure factor is a sum over all atoms in the unit cell:\n$$F(hkl) = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} f_j \\exp[2\\pi i (hx_j + ky_j + lz_j)]$$\nIn our case, the sum is only over the two heavy atoms ($N=2$) at the specified positions. Let the scattering factor for both atoms be $f_H$.

Rearranging this gives $\\exp(i\\theta) + \\exp(-i\\theta) = 2\\cos(\\theta)$.\nLetting $\\theta = 2\\pi l z_H$, we can rewrite the expression for $F_H(hkl)$:\n$$F_H(hkl) = f_H [2\\cos(2\\pi l z_H)]$$\n$$F_H(hkl) = 2 f_H \\cos(2\\pi l z_H)$$\n\nThe problem states that this derivative provides no phasing information for reflections where $l$ is an odd integer. Phasing information from a heavy-atom derivative in MIR is derived from the difference in diffraction amplitudes between the native and derivative crystals, which depends on the magnitude of the heavy-atom structure factor, $|F_H|$. If the phasing information is zero, it means that $|F_H(hkl)| = 0$ for that reflection.\n\nWe are given that $|F_H(hkl)| = 0$ for all reflections where $l$ is an odd integer.\n$$|2 f_H \\cos(2\\pi l z_H)| = 0 \\quad \\text{for } l \\in \\{\\dots, -3, -1, 1, 3, \\dots\\}$$\nSince $f_H$ (the atomic scattering factor) is non-zero, this condition requires that the cosine term must be zero:\n$$\\cos(2\\pi l z_H) = 0$$\nThe cosine function equals zero when its argument is an odd integer multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.

Let's pick $z_H = 1/4$ (corresponding to $n=0$) and check if it makes the cosine term zero for any odd $l$. Let $l_{odd} = 2m+1$ for any integer $m$.\nThe argument of the cosine becomes:\n$$2\\pi l_{odd} z_H = 2\\pi (2m+1) \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = (2m+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}$$\nThis argument is always an odd integer multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Therefore, $\\cos((2m+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2})$ is always zero for any integer $m$. This confirms that $z_H=1/4$ is a valid solution that holds for all odd $l$.
