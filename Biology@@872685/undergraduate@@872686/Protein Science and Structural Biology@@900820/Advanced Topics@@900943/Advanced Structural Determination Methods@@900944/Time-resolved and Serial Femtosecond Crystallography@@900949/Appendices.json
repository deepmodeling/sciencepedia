An intense X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) pulse is used to probe the crystal. However, this same probe pulse can induce radiation damage within its own duration (typically a few femtoseconds), complicating the interpretation of the resulting diffraction patterns.\n\nConsider a simplified model for this intra-pulse damage. We assume that during the probe pulse, the crystal's electron density can be described as a time-dependent mixture of two states: an \"initial\" state (the state of interest) and a \"damaged\" state. A single measured diffraction pattern, consisting of a set of Bragg peak intensities $\\{I_{\\text{obs},k}\\}$, is thus a weighted average. Let $f$ be the fraction of the total scattering signal that originates from molecules in the damaged state, so that the observed intensity for the $k$-th reflection is given by $I_{\\text{obs},k} = (1-f)I_{\\text{ref},k} + f I_{\\text{dam},k}$. Here, $\\{I_{\\text{ref},k}\\}$ are the known intensities from a pure \"initial\" state reference, and $\\{I_{\\text{dam},k}\\}$ are the intensities from the \"damaged\" state. The value of $f$ can vary from shot to shot.\n\nThe damage is hypothesized to systematically alter the electron density in a specific way. This leads to a model where for a fraction $p$ of the reflections (the \"damage-sensitive\" set), the damaged state intensity is uniformly reduced: $I_{\\text{dam},k} = \\alpha I_{\\text{ref},k}$, where $\\alpha$ is a constant factor with $0 \\le \\alpha  1$. For the remaining fraction $(1-p)$ of reflections (the \"damage-insensitive\" set), the intensity is unaffected, i.e., $I_{\\text{dam},k} = I_{\\text{ref},k}$.\n\nTo create a metric for filtering out damaged patterns, we analyze the statistical distribution of the logarithmic intensity ratios, $L_k = \\ln(I_{\\text{obs},k} / I_{\\text{ref},k})$, for all reflections in a given pattern. One powerful statistical measure is the skewness of the distribution of $L_k$ values.
