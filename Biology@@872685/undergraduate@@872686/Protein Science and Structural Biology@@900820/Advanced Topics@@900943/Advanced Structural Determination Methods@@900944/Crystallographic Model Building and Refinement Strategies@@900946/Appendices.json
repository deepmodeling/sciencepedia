To assess the geometric quality of this initial model, a Ramachandran plot is generated. The Ramachandran plot is a two-dimensional plot of the main-chain dihedral angles, phi ($\\phi$) and psi ($\\psi$), for each amino acid residue in the protein.\n\nThe analysis reveals that a specific valine residue in the model has adopted a conformation with $\\phi \\approx +80^\\circ$ and $\\psi \\approx +70^\\circ$. This region of the plot, characterized by positive $\\phi$ values, is typically referred to as the \"glycine-only\" region, as glycine is the only one of the twenty standard amino acids commonly found there.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental chemical explanation for why a valine residue in this conformation is considered a severe stereochemical error?\n\nA. The nonpolar isopropyl side chain of valine cannot form the necessary hydrogen bonds to stabilize a backbone conformation with a positive $\\phi$ angle.\n\nB. A positive $\\phi$ angle forces the $C_\\alpha\\text{-}C_\\beta$ bond of the valine side chain into a position where it causes a severe steric clash with the carbonyl oxygen atom of its own peptide backbone.\n\nC. This conformation is energetically unfavorable because the large valine side chain disrupts the local water structure more significantly than it would in an alpha-helical or beta-sheet conformation.\n\nD. The peptide bond preceding the valine residue must be in the *cis* configuration to allow for a positive $\\phi$ angle, and over 99% of non-proline peptide bonds are *trans*.", "solution": "The Ramachandran plot catalogs sterically allowed combinations of the backbone dihedral angles $\\phi$ (about the $N-C_{\\alpha}$ bond) and $\\psi$ (about the $C_{\\alpha}-C'$ bond) based on short-range, intramolecular steric interactions. For most amino acids, the allowed regions arise fundamentally from avoidance of close contacts that would violate van der Waals exclusion; the energy rises sharply when any pairwise atomic distance $r_{ij}$ falls below the sum of the corresponding van der Waals radii $r_{i}^{\\mathrm{vdW}}+r_{j}^{\\mathrm{vdW}}$, i.e.,\n$$\nr_{ij}<r_{i}^{\\mathrm{vdW}}+r_{j}^{\\mathrm{vdW}} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad E(r_{ij}) \\text{ is very large (steric clash)}.\n$$\nGlycine is exceptional because it lacks a $C_{\\beta}$ atom; its $C_{\\alpha}$ bears only hydrogen. This eliminates key steric contacts, allowing glycine to populate regions of the Ramachandran plot with positive $\\phi$ that are disallowed for residues with side chains.\n\nFor a residue like valine, rotation to a positive $\\phi$ angle positions the $C_{\\alpha}-C_{\\beta}$ substituent so that it approaches the backbone carbonyl oxygen associated with its own residue ($C'=O$ of the same residue). In this geometry, the $C_\\beta \\cdots O$ distance becomes too short,\n$$\nr_{C_{\\beta}O} < r_{C_{\\beta}}^{\\mathrm{vdW}} + r_{O}^{\\mathrm{vdW}},\n$$\nproducing a severe steric clash and a large energy penalty. This is the primary, local steric reason that non-glycine residues are almost never observed with $\\phi>0$, whereas glycine, lacking a $C_{\\beta}$ atom, avoids this clash and can occupy the “glycine-only” region.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because allowed $\\phi,\\psi$ regions are not determined by the ability of a side chain to form hydrogen bonds; the constraint is steric, not hydrogen-bond stabilization of the side chain.\n- B is correct: positive $\\phi$ brings the $C_{\\alpha}-C_{\\beta}$ vector into steric conflict with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of the same residue, a clash avoided only when $C_{\\beta}$ is absent (as in glycine).\n- C is incorrect because perturbation of bulk water structure is not the fundamental origin of the Ramachandran constraints; local steric repulsion is.\n- D is incorrect because a positive $\\phi$ does not require a cis peptide bond; peptide bond is overwhelmingly trans for non-proline irrespective of $\\phi$ sign, and cis/trans relates to the $C'-N$ bond planarity rather than the $N-C_{\\alpha}$ rotation.\n\nTherefore, the severe stereochemical error arises from a fundamental steric clash between the valine side chain and its own backbone carbonyl oxygen at positive $\\phi$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2107402"}, {"introduction": "Model building is an iterative process of proposing a structure and then using the experimental data to correct it.
