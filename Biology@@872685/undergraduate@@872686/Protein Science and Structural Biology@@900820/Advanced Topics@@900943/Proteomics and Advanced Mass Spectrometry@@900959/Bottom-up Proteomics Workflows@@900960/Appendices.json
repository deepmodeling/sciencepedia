This enzymatic digestion step, typically using trypsin, must be efficient to ensure the entire protein is represented in the final analysis. This exercise presents a common experimental challenge—incomplete digestion—and asks you to trace it back to its source, a crucial skill for troubleshooting and optimizing your proteomics workflow. [@problem_id:2101850]", "problem": "An undergraduate student is conducting a bottom-up proteomics experiment to identify the proteins present in a yeast cell lysate. The experimental workflow consists of several key stages: (1) extraction of total protein from the yeast cells, (2) denaturation of the proteins, followed by reduction and alkylation of cysteine residues, (3) enzymatic digestion of the proteins into smaller peptides using trypsin, (4) desalting of the resulting peptide mixture, and finally (5) analysis by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS).\n\nTrypsin is a protease that specifically cleaves peptide chains on the C-terminal side of lysine (K) and arginine (R) residues, unless either is followed by a proline (P). After analyzing the data, the student notes that an unusually high percentage of the identified peptides contain one or more \"missed cleavages\". A missed cleavage refers to a potential trypsin cleavage site within a peptide sequence that remained uncut.\n\nWhich of the following stages of the workflow is the most probable cause for the high number of observed missed cleavages?\n\nA. Peptide separation by liquid chromatography.\n\nB. Protein extraction from the yeast cells.\n\nC. The mass analysis step within the mass spectrometer.\n\nD. The desalting of the peptide mixture.\n\nE. The enzymatic digestion with trypsin.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the proteolytic specificity of trypsin: it cleaves peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of lysine (K) and arginine (R), except when either residue is followed by proline (P). A \"missed cleavage\" is defined as an internal K or R (not followed by P) that remains uncleaved within an identified peptide. Therefore, an elevated frequency of missed cleavages indicates that trypsin did not fully cleave all accessible K/R sites.\n\nThe most direct and mechanistically relevant causes of missed cleavages are factors that reduce the efficiency of the proteolytic reaction, including but not limited to suboptimal pH or temperature, insufficient digestion time, inadequate enzyme-to-substrate ratio, protease inactivation or inhibition, or residual denaturants that impair trypsin activity. All such factors are inherent to the enzymatic digestion step.\n\nWe now consider each workflow stage in the options:\n- Protein extraction (B) determines protein yield and composition but does not dictate whether trypsin cleaves K/R sites once digestion conditions are set; errors here may reduce protein recovery but do not preferentially generate missed cleavages.\n- Denaturation, reduction, and alkylation are critical for exposing cleavage sites, but this stage is not among the provided answer options; thus we evaluate only the listed choices.\n- Enzymatic digestion with trypsin (E) is the step where cleavage occurs and is the proximate source of missed cleavages if conditions are suboptimal. High missed cleavages are classically attributed to incomplete or inefficient digestion in this step.\n- Desalting (D) removes salts and small contaminants and does not affect whether a peptide contains uncleaved K/R internally; it cannot introduce missed cleavages.\n- Peptide separation by liquid chromatography (A) affects retention and separation but does not alter peptide primary structure; it cannot create missed cleavages.\n- Mass analysis (C) measures mass-to-charge ratios and fragmentation; while data quality can affect identification confidence, it does not cause uncleaved sites within the peptide sequences present.\n\nTherefore, the most probable cause for a high number of missed cleavages is the enzymatic digestion with trypsin.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2101850"}, {"introduction": "Following digestion, the resulting peptide mixture is incredibly complex, often containing thousands of unique molecules. To analyze them effectively, they must first be separated, and the primary tool for this is Reversed-Phase Liquid Chromatography (RPLC). This practice will strengthen your understanding of how a peptide's chemical properties, specifically its hydrophobicity, dictate its behavior during RPLC separation, allowing you to predict which peptides will be retained longer on the column. [@problem_id:2101857]", "problem": "In a bottom-up proteomics workflow, a biochemist uses Reversed-Phase Liquid Chromatography (RPLC) to separate a mixture of peptides obtained from enzymatic digestion. The RPLC system utilizes a C18 column, which contains a non-polar (hydrophobic) stationary phase. The separation is performed using a gradient elution, where the mobile phase composition changes over time. The experiment starts with Solvent A (an aqueous solution with 0.1% formic acid, making it highly polar) and the percentage of Solvent B (acetonitrile, a less polar organic solvent) is gradually increased. The mobile phase is maintained at a pH of approximately 2.5 throughout the run.\n\nConsider two synthetic tetrapeptides present in the mixture:\n1.  **Peptide F4**: A tetrapeptide with the sequence Phe-Phe-Phe-Phe, composed of four Phenylalanine (F) residues.\n2.  **Peptide E4**: A tetrapeptide with the sequence Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu, composed of four Glutamic Acid (E) residues.\n\nWhich peptide will be retained longer on the column, thus requiring a higher concentration of Solvent B (acetonitrile) to elute, and what is the fundamental reason for this behavior?\n\nA. Peptide E4, because its side chains are more polar, leading to stronger interactions with the non-polar stationary phase.\n\nB. Peptide F4, because its side chains are large and non-polar, leading to stronger hydrophobic interactions with the stationary phase.\n\nC. Peptide E4, because its side chains are acidic and become deprotonated, leading to strong ionic interactions with the stationary phase.\n\nD. Peptide F4, because its side chains are aromatic, allowing it to move faster through the polar mobile phase.\n\nE. Both peptides will elute at the same time and concentration of Solvent B because they have the same number of amino acid residues.", "solution": "We identify the chromatographic mode and dominant interactions. In Reversed-Phase Liquid Chromatography (RPLC) with a C18 stationary phase, the stationary phase is non-polar (hydrophobic), while the starting mobile phase is polar. Retention increases with analyte hydrophobicity: more hydrophobic analytes partition more strongly into the non-polar stationary phase, exhibit larger distribution coefficients, and thus elute later, requiring a higher proportion of the less polar organic solvent (acetonitrile) to disrupt these interactions.\n\nWe analyze the ionization state of the peptide side chains at the stated pH. The glutamic acid side chain has a carboxylic acid group with an acid dissociation constant characterized by $pK_{a,\\mathrm{Glu}}$. The Henderson–Hasselbalch relation for a weak acid is\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} = pK_{a,\\mathrm{Glu}} + \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{HA}]}\\right),\n$$\nso equivalently\n$$\n\\frac{[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{HA}]} = 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - pK_{a,\\mathrm{Glu}}}.\n$$\nBecause the run is maintained at $\\mathrm{pH} \\approx 2.5$ with $\\mathrm{pH} < pK_{a,\\mathrm{Glu}}$, it follows that $10^{\\mathrm{pH} - pK_{a,\\mathrm{Glu}}} < 1$, so the side-chain carboxyl groups in glutamic acid residues are predominantly in the protonated (neutral) form. Nevertheless, even when protonated, carboxylic acid groups are polar and hydrogen-bonding, rendering the peptide more hydrophilic than one composed of non-polar side chains.\n\nWe compare the two peptides’ side-chain properties:\n- Peptide F4 (Phe-Phe-Phe-Phe) presents four large, non-polar aromatic side chains, which are highly hydrophobic. Such side chains promote strong hydrophobic interactions with the C18 stationary phase, increasing retention.\n- Peptide E4 (Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu) presents four carboxylic acid side chains. At $\\mathrm{pH} < pK_{a,\\mathrm{Glu}}$ they are largely protonated (neutral) but remain polar and more compatible with the polar aqueous mobile phase, leading to weaker hydrophobic interactions with the stationary phase and shorter retention relative to F4.\n\nTherefore, the peptide requiring a higher concentration of acetonitrile (Solvent B) to elute will be the more hydrophobic one, namely F4, because its large non-polar aromatic side chains engage in stronger hydrophobic interactions with the non-polar C18 stationary phase.\n\nThis eliminates incorrect alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because greater polarity does not increase interaction with a non-polar stationary phase.\n- C is incorrect because at the given pH the glutamate side chains are mostly protonated and, regardless, the stationary phase is non-ionic.\n- D is incorrect because aromaticity increases hydrophobic interactions with the stationary phase, not mobility in the polar mobile phase.\n- E is incorrect because retention depends on hydrophobicity, not merely on peptide length or residue count.\n\nThus, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2101857"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of proteomics lies the mass spectrometer, an instrument that precisely measures the mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) of ions.
