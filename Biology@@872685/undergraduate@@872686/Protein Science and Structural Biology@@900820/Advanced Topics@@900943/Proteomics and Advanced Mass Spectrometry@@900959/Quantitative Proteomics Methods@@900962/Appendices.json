To quantify this effect, they employ a quantitative proteomics technique known as Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC).\n\nTwo populations of human cells are cultured. The first, the control group, is grown in a standard \"light\" medium. The second, the experimental group, is treated with the drug and grown in a \"heavy\" medium, in which all lysine amino acids have been replaced with their heavy isotope-labeled counterparts. After the treatment period, equal numbers of cells from both the control and experimental groups are combined. The total protein content is extracted from the mixed cell lysate, and the proteins are digested into peptides using the enzyme trypsin.\n\nThe resulting peptide mixture is analyzed by a mass spectrometer. A specific peptide unique to Protein P is identified for quantification. The mass spectrometer detects two peaks for this peptide: one \"light\" version from the control cells and one \"heavy\" version from the drug-treated cells. The integrated signal intensity for the light peptide peak is measured to be 150,000 units, while the intensity for the heavy peptide peak is 450,000 units.\n\nAssuming the peak intensity in the mass spectrum is directly proportional to the amount of peptide present, calculate the relative abundance of Protein P in the drug-treated cells compared to the control cells.", "solution": "We use the SILAC quantification principle: the integrated MS peak intensity is directly proportional to the amount of the corresponding peptide. With equal numbers of control and drug-treated cells mixed prior to lysis, the ratio of heavy (drug-treated) to light (control) peptide intensities equals the relative abundance of the protein in drug-treated versus control cells.\n\nLet $I_{L}$ be the integrated intensity of the light peptide (control) and $I_{H}$ be the integrated intensity of the heavy peptide (drug-treated). The relative abundance $R$ is\n$$\nR=\\frac{I_{H}}{I_{L}}.\n$$\nGiven $I_{L}=150000$ and $I_{H}=450000$, we compute\n$$\nR=\\frac{450000}{150000}=3.\n$$\nTherefore, Protein P is three times as abundant in the drug-treated cells compared to the control cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2132097"}, {"introduction": "To interpret mass spectrometry data, we must first predict what peptide fragments will be generated from our proteins of interest.
