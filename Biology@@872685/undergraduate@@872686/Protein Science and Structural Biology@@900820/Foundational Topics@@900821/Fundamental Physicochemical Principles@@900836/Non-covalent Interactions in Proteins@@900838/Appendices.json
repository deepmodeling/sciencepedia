The hydrophobic core is a prime example, where stability arises from both the hydrophobic effect and the exquisitely tight packing of nonpolar side chains that maximizes stabilizing van der Waals forces. This problem explores the dramatic consequences of disrupting that packing, demonstrating how creating a small void can lead to a significant loss of stability and highlighting the critical importance of atomic complementarity in protein architecture [@problem_id:2122548].", "problem": "In the study of protein folding and stability, a key principle is the formation of a densely packed hydrophobic core. Consider a hypothetical globular protein, Stabilin, which is highly stable at physiological temperatures. Deep within its hydrophobic core, at position 112, lies an isoleucine residue. This isoleucine is completely buried from the solvent and makes numerous contacts with surrounding nonpolar residues. A researcher creates a mutant version of Stabilin where the isoleucine at position 112 is replaced by a glycine residue. Assuming the mutation does not prevent the protein from folding into a three-dimensional structure, what is the most likely effect on the overall thermodynamic stability of the protein?\n\nA. The stability will significantly increase because the smaller glycine residue relieves steric strain within the tightly packed core.\n\nB. The stability will be largely unaffected because both isoleucine and glycine are nonpolar amino acids, preserving the hydrophobic nature of the core.\n\nC. The stability will significantly decrease because the small size of glycine creates a void in the core, leading to a loss of favorable van der Waals interactions and a disruption of the hydrophobic effect.\n\nD. The stability will significantly increase due to the greater conformational flexibility of glycine, which allows the protein backbone to adopt a lower energy state.\n\nE. The stability will significantly decrease because glycine is a polar amino acid and its introduction into the hydrophobic core is energetically unfavorable.", "solution": "We interpret thermodynamic stability of a folded protein via the folding free energy,\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}=\\Delta H_{\\text{fold}}-T\\Delta S_{\\text{fold}},\n$$\nwhere lower (more negative) $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ indicates higher stability. The relevant physical principles here are: (i) the hydrophobic effect, which favors burial of nonpolar surface area in the core, (ii) van der Waals packing, whose favorable enthalpy arises from tight, complementary side-chain contacts, and (iii) conformational entropy, where increased backbone flexibility in the unfolded state makes folding entropically more costly.\n\nThe wild-type residue at position 112 is isoleucine, a bulky, hydrophobic side chain that is completely buried and makes numerous nonpolar contacts. This contributes favorably to $\\Delta H_{\\text{fold}}$ via van der Waals interactions; qualitatively, the favorable packing enthalpy scales with buried contact area $A$, so one may write a heuristic relation $H_{\\text{vdW}}\\propto -A$.

This introduces a cavity (void) in the core. The enthalpic consequence is a loss of favorable van der Waals contacts and reduced hydrophobic burial, so $\\Delta H_{\\text{fold}}$ becomes less favorable (more positive) upon mutation.\n\nFor the entropic term, glycine increases backbone conformational freedom in the unfolded state, so $S_{\\text{unfold}}^{\\text{mut}}>S_{\\text{unfold}}^{\\text{wt}}$.

Structural analysis of Dimerase reveals that a key interaction involves the side chain of an Alanine at position 84 (Ala84) on Monomer A fitting into a tight, hydrophobic pocket on the surface of Monomer B. This pocket is formed by the side chains of a Leucine at position 112 (Leu112) and a Valine at position 115 (Val115).

Ala84Gly: Gly is smaller than Ala, reduces steric bulk and increases backbone flexibility. It does not introduce charge. It fails to produce steric repulsion and fails to introduce a buried charge; it may also destabilize the monomeric loop by increasing flexibility.\n- B. Ala84Phe: Phe is bulky and hydrophobic; it can create steric clash in a tight pocket (satisfies mechanism (i)) but does not introduce a charge (fails mechanism (ii)). On the monomer surface, a large hydrophobe may be unfavorable due to solvent exposure and potential aggregation, risking monomer stability/solubility.\n- C. Ala84Asp: Asp introduces a negative charge at $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.4$ (satisfies mechanism (ii)). However, Asp’s side chain is relatively short and not especially bulky, so it provides limited steric repulsion compared to larger residues (only partly satisfies mechanism (i)). Asp on a solvent-exposed loop is generally tolerated in the monomer.\n- D. Ala84Lys: Lys introduces a positive charge at $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.4$ (satisfies mechanism (ii)) and has a long, bulky side chain that will strongly sterically clash within a tight hydrophobic pocket (satisfies mechanism (i)). In the monomer, Lys on a surface-exposed loop is well tolerated due to favorable solvation and typically does not compromise the monomeric fold; upon dimerization, the now-buried charged group will be highly destabilizing in the hydrophobic interface.\n- E. Ala84Pro: Pro can significantly perturb local backbone dihedral angles and often destabilizes loops or disrupts secondary structure; it is not charged and only modestly bulky. It fails mechanism (ii) and risks compromising monomer stability.\n\nConclusion: Ala84Lys best maximizes both steric repulsion and the introduction of an unsatisfied buried charge in the dimer interface, while being well tolerated on the monomer’s solvent-exposed loop, thereby minimally affecting the monomeric fold.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2122552"}]}
