For xylosamine, with its non-ionizable side chain, we only need to consider the alpha-carboxyl group and the alpha-amino group. We can determine the average charge of each group at the given pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the alpha-carboxyl group. The ionization equilibrium for this acidic group is:\n$$ \\text{R-COOH} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{R-COO}^{-} + \\text{H}^{+} $$\nThe protonated form (R-COOH) has a charge of 0, and the deprotonated form (R-COO⁻) has a charge of -1. The pKa for this equilibrium is given as $2.10$.\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates pH, pKa, and the ratio of the deprotonated form ([A⁻]) to the protonated form ([HA]):\n$$ \\text{pH} = \\text{pKa} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\text{A}^{-}]}{[\\text{HA}]}\\right) $$\nWe can rearrange this to find the fraction of the group that is in the deprotonated, negatively charged state, $f_{\\text{A}^{-}}$.\n$$ f_{\\text{A}^{-}} = \\frac{[\\text{A}^{-}]}{[\\text{HA}] + [\\text{A}^{-}]} = \\frac{10^{\\text{pH}-\\text{pKa}}}{1 + 10^{\\text{pH}-\\text{pKa}}} $$\nThe average charge of the carboxyl group, $q_{\\text{carboxyl}}$, is the charge of the deprotonated form (-1) multiplied by its fractional abundance:\n$$ q_{\\text{carboxyl}} = (-1) \\cdot f_{\\text{A}^{-}} = -\\frac{10^{\\text{pH}-\\text{pKa}}}{1 + 10^{\\text{pH}-\\text{pKa}}} $$\nSubstituting the given values, pH = 1.75 and pKa = 2.10:\n$$ q_{\\text{carboxyl}} = -\\frac{10^{1.75 - 2.10}}{1 + 10^{1.75 - 2.10}} = -\\frac{10^{-0.35}}{1 + 10^{-0.35}} $$\n$$ q_{\\text{carboxyl}} \\approx -\\frac{0.44668}{1 + 0.44668} \\approx -\\frac{0.44668}{1.44668} \\approx -0.30876 $$\n\nNext, let's analyze the alpha-amino group.
