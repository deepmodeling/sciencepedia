The isoelectric point ($pI$) is a critical parameter, representing the pH at which an amino acid has no net charge.

To calibrate the equipment, they need to calculate the isoelectric point (pI) of alanine, which is the specific pH at which the molecule carries no net electrical charge.\n\nFrom literature, the acid dissociation constant ($pKa$) values for the ionizable groups of alanine are known. The pKa of the alpha-carboxyl group (-COOH) is $pKa_1 = 2.34$, and the pKa of the alpha-amino group (-NH$_{3}^{+}$) is $pKa_2 = 9.69$. The side chain of alanine is a methyl group, which is not ionizable in the typical aqueous pH range.\n\nUsing this information, calculate the isoelectric point (pI) of L-alanine. Express your answer as a numerical value rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The amino acid alanine possesses two ionizable groups: the alpha-carboxyl group and the alpha-amino group. The charge of the alanine molecule is dependent on the pH of the solution. We need to determine the isoelectric point (pI), which is the pH at which the net charge on the molecule is zero.\n\nLet's consider the protonation states of alanine at different pH values:\n1.  At a very low pH (e.g., pH  2), both the carboxyl and amino groups are protonated. The carboxyl group is neutral (-COOH), and the amino group has a positive charge (-NH$_{3}^{+}$). Thus, the net charge of the molecule is +1.\n2.  As the pH of the solution increases and passes the first pKa value ($pKa_1 = 2.34$), the more acidic group, the alpha-carboxyl group, deprotonates. It loses a proton and becomes a negatively charged carboxylate group (-COO$^{-}$). In the pH range between $pKa_1$ and $pKa_2$, the molecule exists primarily as a zwitterion, with a negatively charged carboxylate group and a positively charged amino group (-NH$_{3}^{+}$). The net charge of this zwitterionic form is 0.\n3.  As the pH continues to increase and surpasses the second pKa value ($pKa_2 = 9.69$), the alpha-amino group deprotonates. The -NH$_{3}^{+}$ group loses a proton to become a neutral -NH$_{2}$ group. The molecule now has a net charge of -1 due to the carboxylate group.\n\nThe isoelectric point (pI) is the pH where the concentration of the positively charged species equals the concentration of the negatively charged species, resulting in an average net charge of zero for the population of molecules. For an amino acid with a non-ionizable side chain, such as alanine, the pI is located at the midpoint between the two pKa values that define the zwitterionic state. These are the pKa for the carboxyl group ($pKa_1$) and the pKa for the amino group ($pKa_2$).\n\nTherefore, the pI can be calculated as the arithmetic mean of these two pKa values. The formula is:\n$$pI = \\frac{pKa_1 + pKa_2}{2}$$\n\nWe are given the values $pKa_1 = 2.34$ and $pKa_2 = 9.69$. Substituting these into the formula:\n$$pI = \\frac{2.34 + 9.69}{2}$$\n\nFirst, we perform the addition in the numerator:\n$$pI = \\frac{12.03}{2}$$\n\nNext, we perform the division:\n$$pI = 6.015$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value, 6.015, already contains four significant figures (6, 0, 1, and 5).
