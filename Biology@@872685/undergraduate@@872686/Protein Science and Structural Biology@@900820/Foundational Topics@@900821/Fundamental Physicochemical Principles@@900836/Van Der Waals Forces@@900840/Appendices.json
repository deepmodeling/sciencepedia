While they are individually weak, their cumulative effect is substantial and highly dependent on molecular shape. This exercise explores this principle by comparing two isomers, n-pentane and neopentane, which have the same chemical formula ($\\text{C}_5\\text{H}_{12}$) but different structures. By analyzing how their shapes influence their boiling points, you will develop a fundamental intuition for how molecular surface area dictates the strength of intermolecular attractions [@problem_id:2046099].", "problem": "In a physical chemistry laboratory, a student is presented with two colorless, volatile liquids, labeled A and B. Both liquids are known to be structural isomers with the identical chemical formula $\\text{C}_{5}\\text{H}_{12}$. Liquid A is n-pentane, which has a linear, chain-like molecular structure. Liquid B is neopentane (systematic name: 2,2-dimethylpropane), which has a compact, nearly spherical molecular structure. Since they are isomers, they have the same molar mass. Both molecules are non-polar. The task is to predict the relationship between their boiling points by considering the nature of the intermolecular forces.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly predicts the relative boiling points and provides the correct physical reasoning?\n\nA. Neopentane will have a higher boiling point than n-pentane because its spherical shape allows for more efficient packing, increasing the density of the liquid and the strength of intermolecular attractions.\n\nB. n-Pentane will have a higher boiling point than neopentane because its larger surface area allows for more significant intermolecular contact, leading to stronger overall London dispersion forces.\n\nC. Both liquids will have nearly identical boiling points because they have the same molar mass and number of electrons, and van der Waals forces depend only on these factors.\n\nD. n-Pentane will have a higher boiling point than neopentane because its linear structure creates a small permanent dipole moment, leading to dipole-dipole interactions that are absent in the symmetrical neopentane.\n\nE. Neopentane will have a higher boiling point because the C-C bonds in its branched structure are stronger than those in n-pentane, requiring more energy to break.", "solution": "Identify the dominant intermolecular forces: Both n-pentane and neopentane are nonpolar hydrocarbons, so their intermolecular attractions are London dispersion forces. For nonpolar species, the attractive potential between two molecules at separation $r$ is well modeled by a term of the form $U(r) \\sim -\\frac{C_{6}}{r^{6}}$, where $C_{6}$ depends on the molecular polarizabilities and ionization energies. While structural isomers have very similar total polarizability and ionization energy, the magnitude of the net dispersion interaction in the condensed phase also depends on molecular shape because shape controls how much surface area can come into close contact and how molecules can orient to maximize instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions.\n\nRelate shape to dispersion strength: A linear molecule (n-pentane) has a larger accessible surface area and anisotropic polarizability tensor that allows favorable alignment with neighbors, producing larger effective contact area and thus stronger overall dispersion attractions. A compact, nearly spherical molecule (neopentane) minimizes contact area and presents more isotropic polarizability, leading to weaker net dispersion interactions between molecules in the liquid.\n\nConnect intermolecular force strength to boiling point: Stronger intermolecular attractions imply a larger enthalpy of vaporization $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}$. From the Clausius–Clapeyron relation in its integrated form,\n$$\n\\ln P = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}}{R\\,T} + C,\n$$\nat a fixed external pressure $P$, a larger $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}$ requires a larger temperature $T$ to reach boiling. Therefore, the liquid with stronger dispersion forces will have the higher boiling point.\n\nEvaluate each statement:\n- A is incorrect: while compact shapes may pack efficiently in the solid, in liquids and for boiling points the dominating factor for nonpolar isomers is dispersion strength, which decreases with increased branching (reduced surface area). Neopentane, being more compact, exhibits weaker, not stronger, dispersion interactions.\n- B is correct: n-pentane’s greater surface area allows more intermolecular contact and stronger cumulative London dispersion forces, yielding a higher boiling point than neopentane.\n- C is incorrect: van der Waals (dispersion) forces also depend on molecular shape and surface area, not only on molar mass or electron count.\n- D is incorrect: both molecules are essentially nonpolar alkanes with no permanent dipole; dipole–dipole interactions are absent. The difference arises from dispersion forces, not permanent dipoles.\n- E is incorrect: boiling does not require breaking C–C covalent bonds; it overcomes intermolecular forces. Intramolecular bond strength is not the controlling factor for boiling point differences between isomers.\n\nConclusion: n-pentane has the higher boiling point due to its larger surface area and correspondingly stronger London dispersion forces.

Larger, more polarizable, nonpolar surfaces yield larger $\\sum C_{6,ij}$ and hence more negative (stabilizing) $\\Delta U_{\\text{disp}}$.\n\nComparing the options:\n- Glycine removes side-chain heavy atoms entirely, decreasing the number of contacts and reducing stabilization relative to alanine.\n- Valine and isoleucine are branched aliphatic residues; isoleucine is larger than valine and would provide more dispersion than valine but still less than an even bulkier side chain.\n- Tryptophan has the largest hydrophobic surface among the listed residues, with extensive aromatic electron clouds that increase polarizability and thus $C_{6,ij}$, maximizing the summed dispersion interactions in a spacious, nonpolar pocket.\n\nGiven that steric clashes are not limiting and the energetic change is dominated by van der Waals forces, the substitution that maximizes stabilizing interactions is tryptophan.\n\nTherefore, the most effective choice is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2149860"}, {"introduction": "The van der Waals interaction is a tale of two effects: a gentle, long-range attraction and a harsh, short-range repulsion.
