The conformational flexibility of this chain, which is critical for protein folding, is determined by rotations around the bonds within this backbone. In a naturally occurring polypeptide, the peptide bond connecting the C' of residue $i$ to the N of residue $i+1$ exhibits significant partial double-bond character due to electron resonance. This property confers rigidity and planarity to the peptide group, severely restricting rotation around this C'-N bond.\n\nNow, consider a hypothetical thought experiment.
