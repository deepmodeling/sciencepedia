This problem delves into the logic of Edman degradation, a classic protein sequencing method that relies entirely on this feature. By troubleshooting a failed sequencing experiment [@problem_id:2124549], you will deduce how a common chemical modification can \"block\" the N-terminus, revealing its critical role in biochemical characterization.", "problem": "A biochemist is characterizing a newly isolated peptide hormone, which we will call \"Peptide-H\". Total acid hydrolysis followed by amino acid analysis reveals that Peptide-H is composed of one residue each of Alanine (Ala), Asparagine (Asn), Glutamine (Gln), Phenylalanine (Phe), and Tyrosine (Tyr). To determine the primary sequence, the biochemist employs the automated Edman degradation method. This technique sequentially removes, identifies, and quantifies N-terminal amino acids. The core of the method involves a coupling reaction where phenylisothiocyanate (PITC) reacts with the free $\\alpha$-amino group of the peptide's N-terminal residue. This is followed by a cleavage step that releases the derivatized N-terminal residue as a phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-amino acid, which is then identified. This cycle is repeated to sequence the peptide.\n\nIn this experiment, the analysis of the first cycle from the Edman sequencer shows no detectable PTH-amino acid. Subsequent cycles are also blank, indicating a complete failure of the sequencing reaction from the very first step. The biochemist suspects a spontaneous post-translational modification has occurred at the N-terminus, which is known to be Glutamine (Gln) from other enzymatic cleavage data.\n\nConsidering that the N-terminal residue is Glutamine, which of the following provides the most plausible and direct chemical explanation for the complete failure of the Edman degradation experiment?\n\nA. The N-terminal glutamine has undergone an intramolecular cyclization to form a pyroglutamate residue. This conversion eliminates the free alpha-amino group required for the PITC coupling reaction.\n\nB. The tyrosine residue's hydroxyl group has become phosphorylated. This modification introduces a large, negatively charged group that causes the entire peptide to precipitate out of the reaction solvent.\n\nC. The asparagine residue has been deamidated to aspartate. The resulting negative charge on its side chain forms a salt bridge with a positively charged group, folding the peptide in such a way that the N-terminus is sterically inaccessible.\n\nD. The C-terminal carboxyl group has been converted to an amide. This modification induces a conformational change that propagates along the peptide backbone, blocking the N-terminus.\n\nE. The N-terminal glutamine's side-chain amide has formed a covalent cross-link with the Phenylalanine side chain, creating a branched peptide that cannot be processed by the sequencer.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most chemically sound explanation for the complete failure of an Edman degradation experiment on a peptide with an N-terminal glutamine residue.\n\nThe Edman degradation process is initiated by the reaction of phenylisothiocyanate (PITC) with a free $\\alpha$-amino group ($-\\text{NH}_2$) at the N-terminus of a polypeptide chain. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the nitrogen of the amino group acts as the nucleophile. If this initial reaction cannot occur, the entire sequencing process fails from the start, which matches the experimental observation of no PTH-amino acid being detected in any cycle. We must therefore evaluate which of the proposed scenarios eliminates this crucial reactive group.\n\nLet's analyze the chemistry of the N-terminal glutamine residue. Glutamine has a side chain ending in an amide group ($-\\text{CO-NH}_2$). The N-terminus of the peptide consists of a free $\\alpha$-amino group ($-\\text{NH}_2$). A well-known spontaneous reaction for N-terminal glutamine is an intramolecular cyclization. The nucleophilic $\\alpha$-amino group attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of its own side chain. This is an intramolecular nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction. In this reaction, the side chain's amide group ($-\\text{NH}_2$) is eliminated as an ammonia molecule ($\\text{NH}_3$), and a new amide bond is formed between the $\\alpha$-amino nitrogen and the side-chain carbonyl carbon. This process creates a five-membered lactam ring. The resulting N-terminal residue is called pyroglutamic acid (pGlu).\n\nThe critical consequence of this transformation is that the nitrogen atom that was once part of the free $\\alpha$-amino group is now part of the internal amide bond of the pyroglutamate ring. As a tertiary amide nitrogen, it is no longer basic or nucleophilic and lacks the free protons needed for the PITC coupling chemistry. Therefore, it cannot react with PITC. This \"blocking\" of the N-terminus completely prevents the first step of the Edman degradation, leading to the observed total failure of the sequencing experiment. This matches the description in option **A**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the other options to understand why they are less likely explanations.\n\nOption B: Phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue. While phosphorylation is a common modification, it occurs at a distal position from the N-terminus. While it could potentially affect solubility, it is unlikely to cause such complete precipitation under the varied solvent conditions of a modern sequencer that it would lead to zero signal. More importantly, it does not directly chemically modify the N-terminal amino group, which is the primary site of the reaction.\n\nOption C: Deamidation of asparagine to aspartate. This modification creates a negative charge but occurs at an internal residue, not the N-terminus. While a salt bridge could affect conformation, it is unlikely to cause a complete and absolute steric block of the N-terminus. Such conformational effects might reduce reaction efficiency but rarely abolish it entirely. Furthermore, the N-terminal glutamine itself remains chemically unchanged in this scenario.\n\nOption D: C-terminal amidation. A modification at the C-terminus is very unlikely to have a direct and absolute effect on the chemical reactivity of the N-terminus, which is several residues away. Such \"allosteric\" effects on the reactivity of a small, flexible peptide's terminus are not a standard or direct explanation for Edman degradation failure. The primary cause is almost always a direct chemical modification of the N-terminus itself.\n\nOption E: Cross-linking between Gln and Phe. While cross-linking can occur, a spontaneous reaction between a glutamine side-chain amide and an inert phenylalanine phenyl ring is not a chemically favorable or common reaction under physiological or sequencing conditions. The formation of pyroglutamate is a much more common and spontaneous intramolecular reaction.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and well-established chemical reason for the failure of Edman degradation on a peptide with N-terminal glutamine is its spontaneous cyclization to pyroglutamate, which chemically blocks the N-terminus.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2124549"}]}
