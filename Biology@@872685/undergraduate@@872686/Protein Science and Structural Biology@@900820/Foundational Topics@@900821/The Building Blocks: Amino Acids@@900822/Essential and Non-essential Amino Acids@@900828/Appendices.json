This practice places you in the role of a biochemist tasked with interpreting experimental data from a newly discovered fungus. By analyzing how the absence of a single amino acid from the growth medium affects the organism, you will apply the operational definition of essentiality to classify amino acids based on empirical evidence. [@problem_id:2110740]", "problem": "A team of biochemists is investigating the metabolic capabilities of a newly discovered extremophilic fungus, tentatively named *Myceliothermophilus ignis*. To characterize its nutritional requirements, they aim to identify its essential amino acids. An essential amino acid is one that an organism cannot synthesize on its own and therefore must obtain from its environment to survive and grow.\n\nThe researchers prepared a basal growth medium containing a carbon source (glucose), essential salts, and vitamins, but no amino acids. They confirmed that the fungus cannot grow on this basal medium alone. They then created a \"complete medium\" by adding all 20 standard proteinogenic amino acids to the basal medium, in which the fungus exhibited vigorous growth.\n\nTo test for essentiality, they conducted a series of experiments using \"single-dropout\" media. Each dropout medium was identical to the complete medium but lacked exactly one specific amino acid. The growth of *M. ignis* was observed in each dropout medium after a standard incubation period. The results for a subset of the tested amino acids are summarized in the table below.\n\n| Amino Acid Omitted from Medium | Observed Fungal Growth |\n| :----------------------------- | :--------------------- |\n| Alanine (Ala)                  | Vigorous Growth        |\n| Arginine (Arg)                 | Slow Growth            |\n| Cysteine (Cys)                 | Vigorous Growth        |\n| Histidine (His)                | No Growth              |\n| Leucine (Leu)                  | No Growth              |\n| Methionine (Met)               | No Growth              |\n| Phenylalanine (Phe)            | No Growth              |\n| Proline (Pro)                  | Vigorous Growth        |\n| Threonine (Thr)                | No Growth              |\n\nBased on the definition of an essential amino acid and the experimental data provided in the table, which of the following lists correctly identifies all the essential amino acids for *M. ignis* from the subset tested?\n\nA.

An essential amino acid is one that the organism cannot synthesize itself and must acquire from its environment for growth.\n\nThe experimental design is based on systematically removing one amino acid at a time from a complete growth medium. The effect of this removal on the fungus's growth reveals whether the omitted amino acid is essential or not.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Principle**:\n    - If the fungus can grow normally without a particular amino acid in the medium, it means the fungus can synthesize that amino acid *de novo*. Such an amino acid is considered **non-essential**.\n    - If the fungus fails to grow when a particular amino acid is removed, it means the fungus cannot synthesize it and relies on an external supply. Such an amino acid is **essential**.\n    - If growth is significantly reduced but not completely halted, the amino acid is often termed **conditionally essential** or **semi-essential**. This implies the organism can synthesize it, but not at a rate sufficient for optimal growth. For the purpose of a strict definition, it is not considered essential in the same way as one whose absence completely prevents growth.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Experimental Results from the Table**:\n    - **Vigorous Growth**: The omission of Alanine (Ala), Cysteine (Cys), and Proline (Pro) from the medium did not impede growth. This indicates that *M. ignis* can produce these three amino acids on its own. Therefore, Alanine, Cysteine, and Proline are non-essential.\n    - **No Growth**: The omission of Histidine (His), Leucine (Leu), Methionine (Met), Phenylalanine (Phe), and Threonine (Thr) each resulted in a complete cessation of growth. This demonstrates that *M. ignis* cannot synthesize these five amino acids. According to the definition, Histidine, Leucine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, and Threonine are the essential amino acids within this tested group.\n    - **Slow Growth**: The omission of Arginine (Arg) resulted in slow growth. This means the fungus can synthesize arginine, but not efficiently enough to support vigorous growth. Arginine is therefore conditionally essential, but not strictly essential by the \"no growth\" criterion.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Multiple-Choice Options**:\n    - **A. Alanine, Cysteine, Proline**: This list contains the non-essential amino acids identified in the experiment. This is incorrect.\n    - **B. Arginine**: This identifies the conditionally essential amino acid. It is not a complete list of the essential amino acids. This is incorrect.\n    - **C. Histidine, Leucine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Threonine**: This list includes all the amino acids whose absence led to \"No Growth\". This correctly identifies all the essential amino acids from the tested subset.\n    - **D. Histidine, Leucine, Methionine**: This is an incomplete list of the essential amino acids, as it omits Phenylalanine and Threonine. This is incorrect.\n    - **E. Arginine, Histidine, Leucine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Threonine**: This list incorrectly includes the conditionally essential amino acid (Arginine) along with the essential ones. This is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only option that correctly and completely lists the essential amino acids for *M. ignis* from the provided data is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2110740"}, {"introduction": "While essential amino acids must be obtained from the diet, non-essential amino acids are built using precursors from central metabolism.

The key is to trace the fate of labeled carbons through these steps, recognizing that at short times the oxaloacetate pool is initially unlabeled while acetyl-CoA carbons from the labeled glucose are labeled.\n\nStep 1: Label flow through glycolysis.\nFrom $[\\mathrm{U}\\text{-}^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{6}]$ glucose, glycolysis produces $[\\mathrm{U}\\text{-}^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{3}]$ pyruvate:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{U}\\text{-}^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{6}] \\ \\text{glucose} \\ \\longrightarrow \\ 2 \\times [\\mathrm{U}\\text{-}^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{3}] \\ \\text{pyruvate}.\n$$\n\nStep 2: Pyruvate dehydrogenase to acetyl-CoA.\nPyruvate dehydrogenase removes pyruvate C1 as $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and converts pyruvate C2 and C3 into acetyl-CoA C1 (carbonyl) and C2 (methyl), respectively.

At short times, the pre-existing OAA pool is largely unlabeled. In the first turn of the cycle, the two carbons introduced from acetyl-CoA are not lost as $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$; the decarboxylations of isocitrate and $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate remove carbons derived from OAA.

[@problem_id:2110729]", "problem": "Certain plants, as a defense mechanism against herbivores, produce canavanine, a non-proteinogenic amino acid that is a structural analog of the essential amino acid arginine. An unsuspecting herbivore consuming such a plant may incorporate canavanine into its nascent polypeptide chains, as the arginyl-tRNA synthetase enzyme cannot efficiently distinguish between arginine and canavanine. This incorporation leads to widespread disruption of protein function.\n\nThe key structural difference is that the terminal methylene group (–CH₂–) of the arginine side chain is replaced by an oxygen atom in canavanine. This substitution significantly alters the basicity of the side chain's guanidino group. The pKa of the arginine side chain is approximately 12.5, while the pKa of the canavanine side chain is approximately 7.0.\n\nAssuming the herbivore's intracellular physiological pH is maintained at 7.4, which of the following statements most accurately describes the primary molecular reason for the disruptive effect of canavanine incorporation on protein structure and function?\n\nA. The presence of canavanine leads to the widespread loss of ionic bonds (salt bridges) that are essential for stabilizing protein tertiary and quaternary structure.\n\nB. The canavanine side chain is significantly bulkier than the arginine side chain, causing steric clashes within the protein's core that disrupt its compact folding.\n\nC. The canavanine molecule cannot form a stable peptide bond with adjacent amino acids, leading to premature termination of protein synthesis.\n\nD. The canavanine side chain is more basic than arginine's, causing it to form overly strong and often incorrect ionic bonds that make the protein structure too rigid.\n\nE.

For a basic side chain that exists in equilibrium between the protonated cationic form, denoted $BH^{+}$, and the neutral base form $B$, the equilibrium is\n$$BH^{+} \\rightleftharpoons B + H^{+}.$$\nBy definition,\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{p}K_{a} + \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{[B]}{[BH^{+}]}\\right).\n$$\nRearranging gives\n$$\n\\frac{[B]}{[BH^{+}]} = 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a}},\n$$\nand the fraction of the side chains that are protonated (thus positively charged) is\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{prot}} = \\frac{[BH^{+}]}{[B]+[BH^{+}]} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a}}}.\n$$\n\nApply this to arginine and canavanine at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.4$:\n- Arginine has $\\mathrm{p}K_{a} \\approx 12.5$ for its guanidino group. Since $\\mathrm{pH}  \\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ by a large margin, $10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a}} \\ll 1$, so\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{prot}} \\approx 1,\n$$\nmeaning the arginine side chain is overwhelmingly protonated and positively charged under physiological conditions. This cationic character enables strong ionic interactions (salt bridges) with negatively charged partners (e.g., Asp/Glu side chains, phosphate groups), which stabilize tertiary and quaternary structure.\n- Canavanine has $\\mathrm{p}K_{a} \\approx 7.0$ for its side chain. Here $\\mathrm{pH} > \\mathrm{p}K_{a}$, so $10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a}} > 1$ and\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{prot}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a}}}  \\frac{1}{2},\n$$\nindicating the side chain is predominantly deprotonated and thus largely neutral at physiological pH. Therefore, when canavanine replaces arginine, many sites that would normally contribute a stable positive charge lose that charge, leading to loss or weakening of salt bridges and other electrostatic interactions critical for proper folding, stability, and function.\n\nEvaluation of the options in light of this analysis:\n- Option A is consistent with the above: the reduced basicity and lower protonation of the canavanine side chain at physiological pH causes loss of positive charge and thus loss of ionic bonds that stabilize structure.\n- Option B is incorrect: replacing a methylene with an oxygen does not make the side chain significantly bulkier; steric clashes are not the primary issue.\n- Option C is incorrect: canavanine is incorporated into polypeptides via normal peptide bonds; translation does not terminate due to an inability to form peptide bonds.\n- Option D is incorrect: canavanine is less basic than arginine (lower $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$), not more basic.\n- Option E is incorrect: replacing a methylene with an oxygen increases polarity and decreases hydrophobicity; aggregation via hydrophobic interactions is not the primary mechanism.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that the incorporation of canavanine leads to the loss of essential ionic interactions due to reduced side-chain protonation at physiological pH.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2110729"}]}
