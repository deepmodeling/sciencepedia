They are examining a specific gene locus that influences this trait, which has two codominant alleles: $T_1$ and $T_2$. Using gel electrophoresis on tissue samples, they are able to distinguish between the three possible genotypes. From a large, randomly collected sample of 1123 individual worms from a specific vent site, the biologists identified the following genotype counts:\n\n- 147 individuals with the $T_1T_1$ genotype\n- 562 individuals with the $T_1T_2$ genotype\n- 414 individuals with the $T_2T_2$ genotype\n\nBased on this observed data from the sample, what are the estimated frequencies of the $T_1$ allele and the $T_2$ allele in this population? Calculate these frequencies and express your answers as decimal values rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The goal is to calculate the frequencies of the alleles $T_1$ and $T_2$ from the provided counts of the three genotypes. Let's denote the frequency of the $T_1$ allele as $p$ and the frequency of the $T_2$ allele as $q$.\n\nFirst, we identify the number of individuals for each genotype:\nNumber of $T_1T_1$ individuals, $N_{T_1T_1} = 147$.\nNumber of $T_1T_2$ individuals, $N_{T_1T_2} = 562$.\nNumber of $T_2T_2$ individuals, $N_{T_2T_2} = 414$.\n\nThe total number of individuals in the sample, $N_{total}$, is the sum of these counts:\n$$N_{total} = N_{T_1T_1} + N_{T_1T_2} + N_{T_2T_2} = 147 + 562 + 414 = 1123$$\n\nSince these organisms are diploid, each individual carries two alleles for this gene. Therefore, the total number of alleles in the gene pool of this sample is twice the number of individuals:\n$$\\text{Total number of alleles} = 2 \\times N_{total} = 2 \\times 1123 = 2246$$\n\nNext, we count the number of $T_1$ and $T_2$ alleles in the sample.\n- Each $T_1T_1$ individual has two $T_1$ alleles.\n- Each $T_1T_2$ individual has one $T_1$ allele and one $T_2$ allele.\n- Each $T_2T_2$ individual has two $T_2$ alleles.\n\nThe total count of the $T_1$ allele is:\n$$\\text{Count of } T_1 = (2 \\times N_{T_1T_1}) + (1 \\times N_{T_1T_2}) = (2 \\times 147) + 562 = 294 + 562 = 856$$\n\nThe total count of the $T_2$ allele is:\n$$\\text{Count of } T_2 = (1 \\times N_{T_1T_2}) + (2 \\times N_{T_2T_2}) = 562 + (2 \\times 414) = 562 + 828 = 1390$$\n\nAs a check, the sum of the allele counts should equal the total number of alleles in the gene pool: $856 + 1390 = 2246$, which is correct.\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency of each allele. The frequency of an allele is its total count divided by the total number of alleles in the gene pool.\n\nThe frequency of the $T_1$ allele, $p$, is:\n$$p = \\frac{\\text{Count of } T_1}{\\text{Total number of alleles}} = \\frac{856}{2246} \\approx 0.38112199...$$\n\nThe frequency of the $T_2$ allele, $q$, is:\n$$q = \\frac{\\text{Count of } T_2}{\\text{Total number of alleles}} = \\frac{1390}{2246} \\approx 0.61887800...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answers to be rounded to three significant figures.\nFor the $T_1$ allele frequency:\n$$p \\approx 0.381$$\n\nFor the $T_2$ allele frequency:\n$$q \\approx 0.619$$\n\nThe sum of the frequencies should be 1. Checking our rounded values: $0.381 + 0.619 = 1.000$. The results are consistent.

Tolerance to this mineral is determined by a single gene with two alleles, a dominant allele $A$ and a recessive allele $a$. Individuals with at least one $A$ allele (genotypes $AA$ and $Aa$) are fully tolerant and have normal reproductive success. Individuals with the $aa$ genotype have a slightly reduced viability, leading to a lower reproductive success compared to the tolerant individuals.\n\nWe can quantify this effect using relative fitness values ($w$), where a value of 1 represents the highest reproductive success. For this population, the relative fitness values for the three genotypes are:\n- Fitness of $AA$ genotype: $w_{AA} = 1.0$\n- Fitness of $Aa$ genotype: $w_{Aa} = 1.0$\n- Fitness of $aa$ genotype: $w_{aa} = 0.9$\n\nAssume the population is large, mating is random, and that before the described selection pressure acts, the frequency of the recessive allele $a$ in the gene pool is exactly $0.5$.\n\nCalculate the change in the frequency of allele $a$ in this population after one complete generation of selection.

We are given the initial frequency of allele $a$, $q_0 = 0.5$, and the relative fitness values for the genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$.\n\nFirst, we determine the initial frequency of the dominant allele $A$, denoted as $p_0$.
