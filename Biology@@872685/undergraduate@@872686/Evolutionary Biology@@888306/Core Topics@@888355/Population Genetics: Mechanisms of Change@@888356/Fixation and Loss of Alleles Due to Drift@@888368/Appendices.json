This first exercise explores the most fundamental scenario: the emergence of a single, neutral allele in a simple, haploid population. By calculating its initial frequency and ultimate probability of fixation, you will uncover a core principle of population genetics that connects an allele's starting proportion to its long-term destiny under the influence of random drift. [@problem_id:1929733]", "problem": "In a large, isolated laboratory culture of a haploid bacterium, the population size is maintained at a constant number, $N$. A spontaneous mutation occurs in a single bacterium, giving rise to a new allele at a specific genetic locus. This new allele is selectively neutral, meaning it confers no reproductive advantage or disadvantage compared to the original allele. The fate of this new allele will be determined solely by genetic drift.\n\nAmong the following statements, which one correctly describes both the initial frequency of this new neutral allele in the population and its ultimate probability of fixation (i.e., the probability that it will eventually be the only allele present at that locus in the entire population)?\n\nA.

The initial frequency is $\\frac{1}{N}$, but the probability of fixation cannot be determined without knowing the mutation rate.", "solution": "The problem asks for two quantities related to a new neutral mutation in a haploid population of size $N$: its initial frequency and its probability of fixation. We will determine each quantity step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's determine the initial frequency of the new allele. The population consists of $N$ haploid individuals. This means there are a total of $N$ copies of the gene (allele) in question within the entire population. The problem states that the new mutation arises in a single bacterium. Therefore, there is exactly one copy of the new mutant allele, and the remaining $N-1$ copies are the original (wild-type) allele.\n\nThe frequency of an allele is defined as the number of copies of that allele divided by the total number of copies of all alleles for that gene in the population.\nLet $p_0$ be the initial frequency of the new allele.\n$$p_0 = \\frac{\\text{Number of copies of the new allele}}{\\text{Total number of alleles in the population}}$$\nIn this case, the number of copies of the new allele is 1, and the total number of alleles is $N$.\n$$p_0 = \\frac{1}{N}$$\n\nSecond, let's determine the probability of fixation of this new allele. A fundamental result of population genetics, particularly from the neutral theory of molecular evolution, states that for a selectively neutral allele, its probability of eventually becoming fixed in the population is equal to its current frequency. This is because, under pure genetic drift, every allele present in the current generation has an equal chance of being the ancestor of all alleles in a distant future generation.\n\nSince the allele is new, its \"current\" frequency is its initial frequency, $p_0$.\nLet $P_{\\text{fix}}$ be the probability of fixation.\n$$P_{\\text{fix}} = p_0$$\nSubstituting the value we found for $p_0$:\n$$P_{\\text{fix}} = \\frac{1}{N}$$\n\nTherefore, the initial frequency of the new allele is $\\frac{1}{N}$, and its probability of fixation is also $\\frac{1}{N}$.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\nA. The initial frequency is $\\frac{1}{N}$, and the probability of fixation is $\\frac{1}{N}$. This matches our derivation.\nB. The initial frequency is $\\frac{1}{2N}$, and the probability of fixation is $\\frac{1}{2N}$. This would be correct for a new mutation in a single individual in a diploid population of size $N$, where the total number of alleles is $2N$. The problem specifies a haploid population.\nC. The initial frequency is $\\frac{1}{N}$, and the probability of fixation is $1$. This is incorrect. A fixation probability of 1 would imply the allele is certain to take over, which would require an extremely strong selective advantage, not neutrality.\nD. The initial frequency is $1$, and the probability of fixation is $\\frac{1}{N}$. An initial frequency of 1 means the allele is already fixed, which contradicts the scenario of a new mutation in a single individual.\nE. The initial frequency is $\\frac{1}{N}$, but the probability of fixation cannot be determined without knowing the mutation rate. The mutation rate determines how often new alleles arise, but the fixation probability of an *existing* neutral allele depends only on its frequency and the population size (which is embedded in the frequency calculation), not the rate at which other new mutations might appear.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only correct statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1929733"}, {"introduction": "Our theoretical models often assume an 'ideal' population, but nature is far more complex. This practice introduces the crucial concept of effective population size ($N_e$), the number that truly governs the strength of genetic drift. By analyzing a hypothetical seal population with an uneven number of breeding males and females, you will see how social structure can dramatically reduce a population's genetic size, making it more susceptible to the random loss of alleles and a key consideration in conservation biology.

A complete census of the island where they live reveals a total population of 350 individuals. However, detailed behavioral monitoring during the breeding season shows that the mating system is highly polygynous. The breeding population consists of only 20 dominant, territory-holding males that mate successfully. The number of breeding females is found to be 140. The remaining individuals are non-breeding juveniles, subordinate males, or post-reproductive adults.\n\nA key parameter for assessing the risk of genetic diversity loss in such a population is the Effective Population Size ($N_e$), defined as the size of an idealized population that would experience the same magnitude of random genetic drift as the actual population.\n\nAssuming non-overlapping generations and random mating among the specified breeding individuals, calculate the effective population size $N_e$ for this seal population.

This exercise scales up our perspective, simulating a classic experiment to see how an allele's initial frequency dictates the pattern of fixation and loss across multiple, identical populations.

The sum of the probabilities of fixation and loss must be 1.\n$$P_{fix}(A_2) + P_{loss}(A_2) = 1$$\n\nTherefore, the probability that allele $A_2$ is lost, $P_{loss}(A_2)$, is:\n$$P_{loss}(A_2) = 1 - P_{fix}(A_2) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the expected number of populations where $A_2$ is lost.**\n\nThe experiment involves $N_{pop} = 150$ independent populations, each starting with the same initial conditions. The event of allele $A_2$ being lost in any given population is an independent trial with a probability of success (where success is defined as loss) of $P_{loss}(A_2) = 0.7$.\n\nThe expected number of populations exhibiting a particular outcome is the total number of populations multiplied by the probability of that outcome occurring in a single population.\n\nExpected number of populations where $A_2$ is lost = $N_{pop} \\times P_{loss}(A_2)$\n$$E(\\text{loss of } A_2) = 150 \\times 0.7$$\n$$E(\\text{loss of } A_2) = 105$$\n\nThus, the expected number of populations in which the allele $A_2$ will be completely lost is 105.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{105}$$", "id": "1929727"}]}
