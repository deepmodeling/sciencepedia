{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Calculating allele frequencies is a cornerstone of population genetics, and the most direct way to do this is by counting. This first practice problem [@problem_id:1912320] guides you through this fundamental 'gene counting' method using a scenario with co-dominant alleles, where the genotype of each individual is directly visible from its phenotype. Mastering this basic calculation is the essential first step before tackling more complex evolutionary scenarios.", "problem": "A team of population geneticists is studying a specific enzyme in a species of insect that inhabits a remote island. This enzyme's gene locus has two co-dominant alleles, which we will call $E_1$ and $E_2$. The co-dominance means that the phenotype of an individual, as determined by protein gel electrophoresis, directly reveals its genotype. An individual with genotype $E_1E_1$ will show a single \"fast-migrating\" band on the gel. An individual with genotype $E_2E_2$ will show a single \"slow-migrating\" band. A heterozygous individual, with genotype $E_1E_2$, will show both bands.\n\nThe researchers collected a sample of 50 insects from the island population. After analyzing the enzyme from each insect using gel electrophoresis, they observed the following results:\n- 10 individuals showed only the fast-migrating band.\n- 25 individuals showed both the fast- and slow-migrating bands.\n- 15 individuals showed only the slow-migrating band.\n\nBased on this sample, calculate the frequency of the $E_2$ allele (the 'slow' allele) in the population. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "Because the alleles are co-dominant, each phenotype reveals the genotype counts directly. Let $n_{11}=10$ (genotype $E_{1}E_{1}$), $n_{12}=25$ (genotype $E_{1}E_{2}$), $n_{22}=15$ (genotype $E_{2}E_{2}$), and total sample size $N=50$. Each individual carries two alleles, so the total number of alleles is $2N$. The total number of $E_{2}$ alleles is $2n_{22}+n_{12}$, since each $E_{2}E_{2}$ contributes two $E_{2}$ alleles and each heterozygote contributes one.\n\nTherefore, the sample frequency of the $E_{2}$ allele is\n$$\nf_{E_{2}}=\\frac{2n_{22}+n_{12}}{2N}.\n$$\nSubstituting the observed counts,\n$$\nf_{E_{2}}=\\frac{2\\cdot 15+25}{2\\cdot 50}=\\frac{55}{100}=0.55.\n$$\nRounded to two significant figures, this is $0.55$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.55}$$", "id": "1912320"}, {"introduction": "Often in nature, we cannot directly determine every individual's genotype because of dominant and recessive alleles. This is where the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) principle becomes an invaluable tool. This exercise [@problem_id:1912351] challenges you to work backward from the observed frequency of a recessive phenotype to calculate the frequencies of both the recessive ($t$) and dominant ($T$) alleles, a common task in real-world population studies.", "problem": "A team of microbiologists is studying a population of extremophilic bacteria isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. They have identified a single gene responsible for tolerance to high concentrations of the heavy metal cadmium. The gene has two alleles: a dominant allele $T$ which confers tolerance, and a recessive allele $t$ which results in susceptibility. The population is assumed to be large and randomly mating, and thus in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with respect to this gene.\n\nTo determine the allele frequencies, the researchers collected a random sample of 12,500 individual bacteria. They cultured each bacterium to form a colony and then tested the phenotype of each colony by replica plating onto a growth medium containing a high concentration of cadmium. They observed that 450 of the colonies failed to grow, indicating they were susceptible to cadmium.\n\nBased on this experimental data, calculate the frequency of the dominant tolerance allele $T$ in this bacterial population. Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $p$ be the frequency of the dominant allele $T$ and $q$ be the frequency of the recessive allele $t$, with $p+q=1$. Under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the genotype frequencies are $p^{2}$ for $TT$, $2pq$ for $Tt$, and $q^{2}$ for $tt$. The susceptible phenotype corresponds to the homozygous recessive genotype $tt$, so its frequency is $q^{2}$.\n\nFrom the data, the observed frequency of susceptible colonies is the sample proportion\n$$\nq^{2}=\\frac{450}{12500}=\\frac{9}{250}.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\nq=\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{250}}=\\frac{3}{5\\sqrt{10}}.\n$$\nThe frequency of the dominant allele is\n$$\np=1-q=1-\\frac{3}{5\\sqrt{10}}.\n$$\nFor the required numerical value rounded to three significant figures,\n$$\np=1-\\frac{3}{5\\sqrt{10}}\\approx 0.810263\\ldots \\approx 0.810.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.810}$$", "id": "1912351"}, {"introduction": "Evolutionary processes are not confined to single, uniform populations. This advanced practice problem [@problem_id:1912295] simulates a realistic conservation scenario where two populations with different ploidy levels are merged. To find the new allele frequency, you must think of the gene pool as the total collection of alleles, weighting the contribution of each population by both its size and its ploidy, demonstrating how foundational principles apply to complex, real-world genetic management questions.", "problem": "Conservation biologists are managing two isolated populations of an endangered flowering plant. The first population, located in a remote nature reserve, consists of 150 individuals, all of which are diploid. In this reserve population, the frequency of a beneficial allele, denoted as $R$, is 0.10. The second population, cultivated in a specialized botanical garden, consists of 100 individuals that are all stable autotetraploids (meaning they have four sets of chromosomes). The frequency of the same allele $R$ in the garden population is 0.85.\n\nTo create a more robust and genetically diverse group, a new sanctuary is established, and all individuals from both the reserve and the garden are relocated and merged into a single, interbreeding population.

Let $N_{2}$ be the number of autotetraploids, $c_{2}$ their ploidy, and $p_{2}$ the frequency of $R$ in population $2$.
