While advantageous mutations are favored by natural selection, the destiny of a neutral allele is governed entirely by chance. This exercise provides a foundational understanding of genetic drift by calculating the probability that a single new allele will, over many generations, randomly become the only version of that gene in the entire population. Understanding this simple yet powerful principle, where the fixation probability equals the allele's initial frequency ($p = \\frac{1}{2N}$), is the first step in appreciating the significant role of randomness in evolution.

The founding population consists of 60 diploid, sexually reproducing individuals. Shortly after their introduction, a spontaneous and selectively neutral mutation occurs on a single chromosome within a single bird. Assuming no further mutations at this genetic locus and no migration to or from the island, calculate the probability that this new variant of the gene will eventually become the only version present in the entire population.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability that a new, neutral mutation will reach fixation in a small, isolated population. The key principle governing this process is genetic drift.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of gene copies (alleles) for the locus in question within the entire population. The population is described as diploid, meaning each individual carries two alleles for each autosomal gene. The population size, denoted by $N$, is given as 60 individuals.\nThe total number of alleles in the gene pool is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{Total alleles} = 2 \\times N = 2 \\times 60 = 120\n$$\n\nNext, we identify the initial frequency of the new mutant allele. The problem states that the mutation arises on a single chromosome in a single individual. This means there is exactly one copy of the new mutant allele in the entire gene pool at the moment of its appearance.\n\nThe initial frequency, $p$, of a new allele is the number of copies of that allele divided by the total number of alleles in the population.\n$$\np = \\frac{\\text{Number of copies of the new allele}}{\\text{Total number of alleles}} = \\frac{1}{2N}\n$$\n\nA fundamental result in population genetics, established by Motoo Kimura, states that for a selectively neutral allele, its probability of eventually becoming fixed in the population (i.e., reaching a frequency of 1.0) is equal to its initial frequency.\n\nTherefore, the probability of fixation for this new neutral mutation is:\n$$\nP_{\\text{fixation}} = p = \\frac{1}{2N}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given population size $N=60$ into this formula gives:\n$$\nP_{\\text{fixation}} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 60} = \\frac{1}{120}\n$$\n\nTo express this as a decimal rounded to three significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{120} \\approx 0.0083333...\n$$\n\nRounding to three significant figures, we look at the first three non-zero digits (8, 3, 3) and the fourth digit (3).

Real populations often fluctuate, experiencing periods of abundance and scarcity. This practice explores the concept of *effective population size* ($N_e$), a measure that reflects a population's genetic behavior more accurately than its simple census count. By calculating $N_e$ for a population that has undergone a severe bottleneck, you will discover how past demographic events can have a lasting and disproportionate impact on genetic drift, making a population genetically \"smaller\" than it appears.

Wildlife biologists recorded the census population size for four consecutive generations as 400, 30, 25, and 500.
