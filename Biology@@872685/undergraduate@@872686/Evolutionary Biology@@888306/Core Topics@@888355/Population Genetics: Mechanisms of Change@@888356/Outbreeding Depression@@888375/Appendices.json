Population A originates from a cool, moist coastal environment, while Population B comes from a hot, arid inland region. These populations have been evolving independently for many generations.\n\nTo assess the fitness effects of crossing these populations, the biologist conducts a controlled breeding experiment. The fitness of individuals is quantified using a composite metric called Lifetime Reproductive Success (LRS), which integrates survival to adulthood, mating success, and total number of viable offspring. The LRS values are normalized relative to the inland population.\n\nThe experiment yielded the following mean LRS values for each group:\n\n*   **Parental Cross (A × A):** The average LRS for offspring from within the coastal population is 0.96.\n*   **Parental Cross (B × B):** The average LRS for offspring from within the inland population is 1.00.\n*   **F1 Hybrid Cross:** Offspring from crosses between Population A and Population B (both A♂ × B♀ and B♂ × A♀) have an average LRS of 1.12.\n*   **F2 Hybrid Cross:** Offspring produced by intercrossing the F1 hybrids (F1 × F1) have an average LRS of 0.75.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following evolutionary phenomena is most clearly demonstrated by the sharp change in fitness observed in the F2 generation?\n\nA.

Founder effect", "solution": "Define the measured mean fitness (LRS) of each cross type as relative fitness values:\n$$w_{AA}=0.96,\\quad w_{BB}=1.00,\\quad w_{F1}=1.12,\\quad w_{F2}=0.75.$$\n\nAssess the F1 outcome relative to the parental lines. Compute the difference between the F1 and the best parent:\n$$w_{F1}-\\max\\{w_{AA},w_{BB}\\}=1.12-1.00=0.12>0.$$\nThis inequality indicates that F1 hybrids exceed both parental lines in fitness, which is the signature of heterosis (hybrid vigor). Thus, the F1 result is consistent with heterosis.\n\nAssess the F2 outcome relative to the parents and F1. First, compare F2 to the worse parent:\n$$w_{F2}-\\min\\{w_{AA},w_{BB}\\}=0.75-0.96=-0.21<0,$$\nso F2 is less fit than either parent. Also, compare F2 to F1:\n$$w_{F2}-w_{F1}=0.75-1.12=-0.37<0,$$\nso there is a sharp drop from F1 to F2.\n\nInterpretation based on genetic principles:\n- Heterosis in F1 commonly arises from dominance complementation and favorable epistasis when divergent populations are crossed.\n- A sharp reduction in F2 fitness relative to both parents and the F1 is expected when recombination breaks up coadapted gene complexes and reveals negative epistatic interactions (e.g., Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibilities). This phenomenon is termed hybrid breakdown and is a canonical manifestation of outbreeding depression, which typically appears in F2 or later generations because recombination and segregation generate maladaptive allele combinations.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A (Genetic drift): A stochastic change in allele frequencies at the population level; it does not explain the systematic F1 elevation and F2 collapse observed in controlled crosses.\n- B (Inbreeding depression): Results from increased homozygosity exposing deleterious recessives within a single population, typically evident in consanguineous matings; the pattern here arises from interpopulation crosses and recombination-driven breakdown, not classical inbreeding within a lineage.\n- C (Outbreeding depression): Reduced fitness due to mating between genetically divergent populations that disrupts coadapted gene complexes; classically most evident in F2 and later. This matches the sharp F2 fitness drop.\n- D (Heterosis): Explains the F1 elevation, but the question asks for the phenomenon most clearly demonstrated by the sharp change in the F2 generation.\n- E (Founder effect): A demographic sampling phenomenon; not relevant to these cross-type fitness patterns.\n\nTherefore, the sharp reduction in F2 fitness most clearly demonstrates outbreeding depression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1951938"}, {"introduction": "After identifying the pattern of outbreeding depression, the next step is to understand its underlying genetic cause. This exercise provides a classic two-locus model of a genetic incompatibility, where parental genotypes are fit but certain novel recombinant genotypes in the F2 generation are not [@problem_id:1951925]. By applying principles of Mendelian inheritance, you will calculate the precise expected mean fitness of the F2 generation, bridging the gap between a conceptual phenomenon and a quantitative prediction.", "problem": "Two geographically isolated populations of a diploid plant species have been studied. Genetic analysis reveals that all individuals in Population 1 are homozygous for the genotype $AAbb$, while all individuals in Population 2 are homozygous for the genotype $aaBB$. The two gene loci, $A$/$a$ and $B$/$b$, are located on different chromosomes and assort independently. These genotypes represent locally adapted gene complexes.\n\nWhen hybrids are created in a controlled environment, a form of post-zygotic reproductive isolation is observed, a phenomenon known as outbreeding depression. While the parental genotypes ($AAbb$ and $aaBB$) are perfectly viable and are assigned a relative fitness of $w=1.0$, certain novel combinations of alleles are deleterious. Specifically, the genotypes $AABB$ and $aabb$ are embryonic lethal, resulting in a fitness of $w=0$. All other seven possible genotypes are found to be fully viable, with a fitness of $w=1.0$.\n\nAn experiment is conducted where an individual from Population 1 is crossed with an individual from Population 2, producing an F1 generation.

Genetic analysis reveals that they are fixed for different alleles at several loci. We are interested in two unlinked autosomal loci, $N$ and $H$, and the mitochondrial genome, $M$.\n\n- Population A is genetically uniform, with genotype $N_A N_A$, $H_A H_A$, and mitochondrial haplotype $M_A$.\n- Population B is genetically uniform, with genotype $N_B N_B$, $H_B H_B$, and mitochondrial haplotype $M_B$.\n\nThe overall fitness of an individual is determined by the multiplicative effects of fitness components associated with these loci. The baseline fitness is 1.\n\n1.  **Mito-nuclear Interaction**: A specific incompatibility exists. The protein product of the nuclear allele $N_A$ interferes with cellular respiration in the presence of the mitochondrial haplotype $M_B$. Consequently, the fitness of any individual possessing at least one $N_A$ allele *and* the $M_B$ mitochondrial haplotype is multiplied by a factor of $(1-s_m)$, where $s_m$ is the mito-nuclear selection coefficient ($0 < s_m < 1$).

Individuals homozygous at this locus ($H_A H_A$ or $H_B H_B$) experience a fitness reduction, with their fitness multiplied by a factor of $(1-d)$, where $d$ is an inbreeding depression coefficient ($0 < d < 1$). Heterozygous individuals ($H_A H_B$) exhibit hybrid vigor at this locus and suffer no such fitness cost (fitness multiplier of 1).\n\nScientists perform two sets of reciprocal crosses. In the first experiment, F1 hybrids are produced by crossing population A males with population B females. In the second, F1 hybrids are produced by crossing population B males with population A females. Within each experiment, the resulting F1 hybrids are allowed to randomly mate among themselves (equivalent to self-fertilization for a hermaphrodite) to produce an F2 generation.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the mean fitness of the F2 generation from the \"B male x A female\" cross to the mean fitness of the F2 generation from the \"A male x B female\" cross.
