This first exercise provides a clear and controlled scenario, an artificial selection experiment on fruit flies, to illustrate the core principle of disruptive selection.

The experiment begins with a large, genetically diverse population where the number of abdominal bristles, a quantitative trait, is normally distributed. In every generation, the biologist implements a rigorous artificial selection protocol. After all flies in a generation have matured, they are scored for their bristle count. The top 15% of flies with the highest bristle counts and the bottom 15% of flies with the lowest bristle counts are isolated and allowed to reproduce to create the next generation. The 70% of flies with intermediate bristle counts are culled from the population and do not contribute to the subsequent generation's gene pool.\n\nThis experimental procedure is a direct and controlled application of a specific mode of natural selection. Which of the following terms best describes the selective pressure being imposed on the fly population?\n\nA. Stabilizing selection\n\nB. Directional selection\n\nC. Disruptive selection\n\nD. Negative frequency-dependent selection\n\nE. Balancing selection", "solution": "Let $z$ denote an individual fly’s abdominal bristle count (a quantitative trait).

By definition, this is disruptive (diversifying) selection, which increases phenotypic variance and favors both extremes over intermediates.\n\nTo exclude alternatives:\n- Stabilizing selection would have an inverted U-shaped $w(z)$, favoring intermediates and culling extremes, which is the opposite of this design.\n- Directional selection would have a monotonic $w(z)$ favoring only one extreme (either high or low), not both.\n- Negative frequency-dependent selection requires fitness to depend on trait frequency; here fitness is assigned by fixed phenotype thresholds, not by rarity.\n- Balancing selection is a broader category that maintains variation via mechanisms such as heterozygote advantage, frequency dependence, or fluctuating selection; the specific pattern here is explicitly disruptive selection.\n\nTherefore, the selective pressure imposed is disruptive selection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1928569"}, {"introduction": "Disruptive selection does more than just shape phenotypic distributions; it directly alters the genetic makeup of a population. This practice challenges you to quantify these genetic consequences within a classic ecological scenario involving a plant adapting to a bimodal resource landscape.

This bimodal resource availability imposes strong disruptive selection on the plant's germination timing.

This final practice explores how disruptive selection can emerge from such trade-offs, using a model of sexual selection in a lekking bird species. You will analyze how the balance between mating success (which favors specialists) and survival cost (which favors generalists) determines the overall evolutionary outcome, and derive the critical threshold where the population is pushed toward splitting into two distinct forms. [@problem_id:1919458]", "problem": "In a hypothetical species of lekking bird, males compete for mates by producing a complex signal with two components: an acoustic signal and a visual signal. The investment a male makes into the acoustic signal is denoted by $x$, and the investment into the visual signal is denoted by $y$. Due to a physiological trade-off, the total signaling investment for any male is constrained by a fixed energy budget, $E$, such that $x+y=E$. A male's signaling strategy is therefore determined by his choice of $x$ in the range $[0, E]$. A strategy with $x=E/2$ is termed \"generalist\", while strategies with $x=0$ or $x=E$ are termed \"specialists\".\n\nA male's overall reproductive success (fitness) depends on two factors: his mating success and his subsequent survival.\n\n1.  **Mating Success**: Females of this species exhibit a \"disjunctive\" mate choice rule, meaning they are disproportionately attracted to males who are exceptionally strong in either one of the signal components. This behavioral preference leads to a male's mating success, $W_{\\text{mate}}$, being proportional to the sum of the squares of his signal investments. This can be modeled as $W_{\\text{mate}}(x, y) = k_m (x^2 + y^2)$, where $k_m$ is a positive constant.\n\n2.  **Survival Cost**: Extreme specialization in signaling is physiologically costly, imposing a survival penalty. The probability of a male's survival after the breeding season, $W_{\\text{surv}}$, is highest for generalists and decreases for specialists. This is modeled by a Gaussian function centered on the generalist strategy: $W_{\\text{surv}}(x) = \\exp\\left( - \\frac{(x - E/2)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\right)$. The parameter $\\sigma > 0$ represents the breadth of physiologically viable strategies; a larger $\\sigma$ indicates weaker survival selection against specialists.\n\nThe total relative fitness of a male, $W(x)$, is the product of his mating success and survival probability. Disruptive selection occurs when the fitness landscape favors specialists over generalists, meaning the generalist strategy ($x=E/2$) corresponds to a local minimum of fitness. This regime emerges when the stabilizing effect of survival cost is weak compared to the diversifying effect of female choice.\n\nDetermine the critical value of the dimensionless ratio $\\sigma/E$ at which the overall selection pressure transitions from stabilizing (favoring generalists) to disruptive (favoring specialists).", "solution": "The energy budget constraint implies $y=E-x$, so the mating success is\n$$W_{\\text{mate}}(x)=k_{m}\\left(x^{2}+(E-x)^{2}\\right)=k_{m} f(x),$$\nwhere\n$$f(x)=x^{2}+(E-x)^{2}=2x^{2}-2Ex+E^{2}.$$\nThe survival probability is\n$$W_{\\text{surv}}(x)=\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-E/2)^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)=\\exp\\!\\big(g(x)\\big),$$\nwith\n$$g(x)=-\\frac{(x-E/2)^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}.$$\nThus total fitness is\n$$W(x)=k_{m} f(x)\\exp\\!\\big(g(x)\\big).$$\nTo determine whether $x^{*}=E/2$ is a local maximum (stabilizing selection) or a local minimum (disruptive selection), evaluate the curvature at $x^{*}$.
