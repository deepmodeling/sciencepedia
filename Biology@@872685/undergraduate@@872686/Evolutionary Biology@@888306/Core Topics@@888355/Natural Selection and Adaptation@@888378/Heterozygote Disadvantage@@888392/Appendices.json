This process is the crucial first step in linking observable ecological interactions, like predation, to their underlying genetic and evolutionary consequences.", "problem": "A population geneticist is studying a species of moth where a single gene with two alleles, $A_1$ and $A_2$, controls the primary wing color. This coloration is crucial for camouflage against specific predators. The two homozygous genotypes, $A_1A_1$ and $A_2A_2$, result in phenotypes that are well-camouflaged in the local environment, but the heterozygous genotype, $A_1A_2$, produces an intermediate coloration that stands out, leading to higher predation. This phenomenon is a classic example of heterozygote disadvantage, or underdominance.\n\nTo quantify the strength of selection, the researcher tags a cohort of 800 newly emerged moths. Genotyping reveals the initial counts to be 300 individuals of genotype $A_1A_1$, 200 of genotype $A_1A_2$, and 300 of genotype $A_2A_2$. After one predation season, the surviving moths are recaptured and counted. The census finds 282 survivors of genotype $A_1A_1$, 156 of genotype $A_1A_2$, and 288 of genotype $A_2A_2$.\n\nCalculate the selection coefficient, $s$, for the heterozygous genotype ($A_1A_2$).
