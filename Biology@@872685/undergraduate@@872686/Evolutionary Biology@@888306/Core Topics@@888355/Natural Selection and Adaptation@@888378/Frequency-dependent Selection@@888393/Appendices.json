The dominant frequency of this song is a heritable quantitative trait that varies continuously among males in the population. Field biologists have observed a unique mating behavior: females exhibit a strong preference for males whose song frequencies are the least common in the population at any given time. This means that a male with a rare song frequency (either unusually high, unusually low, or even an intermediate frequency, as long as it is rare) achieves significantly higher mating success than males with common song frequencies. As a consequence, the most prevalent song frequencies in one generation often become less successful in the next, as they are no longer rare.\n\nWhich of the following evolutionary mechanisms best describes the selection acting on the song frequency in this katydid population?\n\nA. Stabilizing selection\n\nB. Positive frequency-dependent selection\n\nC. Directional selection\n\nD. Disruptive selection\n\nE. Negative frequency-dependent selection", "solution": "We are asked to identify which evolutionary mechanism best describes selection when females prefer rare male song frequencies, regardless of whether they are high, low, or intermediate, and where the most common frequencies in one generation become less successful in the next.\n\nDefine the quantitative trait as $x$ (song frequency), and let $p(x)$ denote the frequency (proportion) of males with trait value $x$ in the population at a given time. Let $w(x)$ denote the mating fitness of males with trait $x$. The observed behavior states that rarer trait values have higher mating success; equivalently, fitness decreases as the trait’s population frequency increases. This implies a negative relationship between $w$ and $p$:\n$$\n\\frac{dw}{dp}  0.\n$$\nA simple qualitative form consistent with the description is $w(x)=f(p(x))$ with $f$ strictly decreasing. This captures that any $x$ that is rare (small $p(x)$) has elevated fitness, and as $p(x)$ increases in the next generation, its fitness advantage diminishes. This produces fluctuating dynamics where formerly common types lose advantage because they are no longer rare.\n\nWe now evaluate the options by comparing their expected $w$–$p$ relationship and phenotypic pattern:\n\n- Stabilizing selection (A) favors intermediate trait values and reduces variance around a mean; its fitness pattern is a function of trait value $x$, not directly of $p(x)$, and does not require $ \\frac{dw}{dp}  0$. It typically yields maximal $w$ at intermediate $x$ regardless of rarity, so it does not match the rare-type advantage observed.\n\n- Positive frequency-dependent selection (B) satisfies $ \\frac{dw}{dp}  0$, where common variants have higher fitness; this is the opposite of the observed rare-type advantage.\n\n- Directional selection (C) systematically favors higher or lower $x$ (one tail), shifting the mean; fitness depends on $x$ in a monotonic manner, not on $p(x)$, and does not generally invert when the favored type becomes common. It does not match the reported dependence on rarity.\n\n- Disruptive selection (D) favors both extremes over intermediates based on $x$, usually increasing variance. It is not inherently dependent on rarity and would not, by itself, grant any rare intermediate $x$ an advantage. Thus it does not match the observation that any rare $x$ (including intermediate) is favored.\n\n- Negative frequency-dependent selection (E) is defined by fitness that decreases with a variant’s own frequency, i.e., $ \\frac{dw}{dp}  0$. This exactly matches the observation: rare song frequencies, regardless of their absolute value, enjoy higher mating success, and formerly common variants lose their advantage when they become common.\n\nTherefore, the mechanism is negative frequency-dependent selection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1961875"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic concept, this practice delves into the real-world biological phenomena of mimicry to illustrate the nuances of frequency-dependent selection. You will analyze two classic mimicry systems—Batesian and Müllerian—which provide a powerful contrast between negative and positive frequency-dependent dynamics [@problem_id:1916883]. This exercise sharpens your ability to discern how the costs and benefits of a trait's frequency shape different evolutionary outcomes.", "problem": "Consider two distinct evolutionary scenarios involving mimicry, the phenomenon where one species evolves to resemble another.\n\n**Scenario 1:** On an isolated island, a non-venomous snake species, the \"Gilded Tree Snake,\" is palatable to local predatory birds. It shares its habitat with the \"Emerald Viper,\" a highly venomous species. Over many generations, the Gilded Tree Snake has evolved a bright green and yellow pattern that is strikingly similar to the warning coloration of the Emerald Viper. Predators that learn to avoid the venomous viper consequently also avoid the harmless tree snake.\n\n**Scenario 2:** In a specific neotropical forest, two unrelated species of poison frogs, \"Frog A\" and \"Frog B,\" are both noxious and unpalatable to predators due to toxins in their skin. Despite belonging to different evolutionary lineages, both species have independently evolved an identical, vibrant red-and-blue skin pattern. Predators in the forest learn to associate this specific pattern with a highly unpleasant experience and avoid attacking any frog that displays it.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes a fundamental difference in the evolutionary selective pressures governing these two scenarios?\n\nA. The mimicry in Scenario 1 is an example of positive frequency-dependent selection, whereas the mimicry in Scenario 2 is an example of negative frequency-dependent selection.\n\nB. In Scenario 1, the presence of the Gilded Tree Snake imposes a negative fitness cost on the Emerald Viper, whereas in Scenario 2, the presence of Frog A provides a positive fitness benefit to Frog B.\n\nC. Both scenarios are driven by positive frequency-dependent selection, where the mimic's fitness increases as it becomes more common.\n\nD. The evolution of mimicry in Scenario 1 provides a fitness benefit only to the mimic (Gilded Tree Snake), while in Scenario 2, it results in a fitness cost for both Frog A and Frog B due to increased competition.\n\nE. Effective mimicry in Scenario 1 requires predators to have a perfect, life-long memory of a single bad encounter, while Scenario 2 only requires short-term learning.", "solution": "Step 1: Classify the mimicry types based on the scenarios and state the governing principles.\n- Scenario 1 describes Batesian mimicry: a palatable (harmless) mimic (Gilded Tree Snake) resembles an unpalatable or dangerous model (Emerald Viper). Predators learn to avoid the model’s warning signal, and the mimic benefits by reduced predation. In Batesian mimicry, the mimic’s fitness advantage is typically subject to negative frequency-dependent selection: as the frequency of the mimic increases relative to the model, the reliability of the warning signal is diluted, predators may sample more often, and the model can incur a fitness cost.\n- Scenario 2 describes Müllerian mimicry: two unpalatable species (Frog A and Frog B) converge on the same warning signal. Both species benefit because predators learn a single association more efficiently, reducing predation on all co-mimics. The shared aposematic pattern is subject to positive frequency-dependent selection: as the frequency of the shared signal increases, its efficacy and the fitness of each bearer increase.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate each option against these principles.\n- Option A states that Scenario 1 is positive frequency-dependent and Scenario 2 is negative frequency-dependent. This reverses the standard frequency dependence of Batesian (negative) and Müllerian (positive) mimicry, so it is incorrect.\n- Option B states that in Scenario 1 the presence of the mimic imposes a negative fitness cost on the model, and in Scenario 2 the presence of one co-mimic provides a positive fitness benefit to the other. This matches Batesian (model harmed by abundant mimics) and Müllerian (mutual benefit via shared predator education), so it is correct.\n- Option C states both are driven by positive frequency-dependent selection, which is incorrect for Batesian mimicry of the mimic.\n- Option D claims Müllerian mimicry results in fitness costs due to increased competition, which is not the fundamental selective pressure shaping aposematic convergence; the key selective force is predator learning that reduces predation risk for both species.\n- Option E invokes a requirement for perfect, life-long memory in Scenario 1, which is not necessary; both scenarios rely on predator learning and generalization, not perfect memory, and this is not the fundamental difference.\n\nConclusion: Option B most accurately captures the fundamental difference in selective pressures between Batesian and Müllerian mimicry in the given scenarios.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1916883"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice shifts from qualitative identification to quantitative analysis, demonstrating how negative frequency-dependent selection can be mathematically modeled to predict evolutionary outcomes. By examining a coevolutionary arms race between a host and a pathogen [@problem_id:2297374], you will calculate the stable equilibrium allele frequency that this selection maintains. This hands-on calculation reveals how negative frequency-dependent selection acts as a crucial mechanism for preserving genetic variation within a population.", "problem": "In a simplified model of host-parasite coevolution, consider a large, randomly mating population of a diploid plant species. A single gene locus in this plant determines its resistance to a prevalent fungal pathogen. This locus has two alleles: a dominant allele $R$ that confers resistance, and a recessive allele $S$ that results in susceptibility. Let $p$ be the frequency of the $R$ allele and $q$ be the frequency of the $S$ allele in the population's gene pool.\n\nThe pathogen population is highly adaptive and exerts strong negative frequency-dependent selection on the host. This means that the more common a host phenotype (resistant or susceptible) is, the less fit it becomes, because the pathogen specializes in attacking the most abundant target. The relative fitness, $w$, of any individual plant is modeled as $w = 1 - k \\cdot f$, where $f$ is the frequency of that individual's phenotype in the overall population, and $k$ is a positive constant representing the intensity of the selection pressure. Aside from this selection, all other Hardy-Weinberg conditions are met.\n\nCalculate the stable, non-trivial equilibrium frequency of the resistance allele $R$.

Because $R$ is dominant, the resistant phenotype frequency is $f_R = p^2+2pq = 1-q^2$ and the susceptible phenotype frequency is $f_S = q^2$.\n\nNegative frequency-dependent selection assigns fitness $w=1-k f$ to an individual with phenotype frequency $f$.
