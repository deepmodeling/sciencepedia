This exercise demonstrates how to calculate the narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$), a fundamental parameter in quantitative genetics, by analyzing the results of a single generation of artificial selection. By comparing the traits of parents, their selected subgroup, and their offspring, you can determine the proportion of selection that translates into an evolutionary response.
