Individuals with at least one $A$ allele (genotypes $AA$ and $Aa$) display a bright, conspicuous color pattern. Individuals with the homozygous recessive genotype ($aa$) display a cryptic, camouflaged pattern.\n\nDue to differential predation, the conspicuous fish have a lower survival rate. Specifically, their probability of surviving from zygote to reproductive age is 20% lower than that of the camouflaged fish.\n\nAssume the population mates randomly, has non-overlapping generations, and that natural selection is the only evolutionary force acting on this locus. If the initial frequency of the dominant allele $A$ in the population's gene pool is 0.5, what will be the frequency of the recessive allele $a$ in the gene pool of the next generation?\n\nProvide your answer as a number rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "Let $p$ be the frequency of the dominant allele $A$ and $q$ be the frequency of the recessive allele $a$. The problem gives the initial frequency of allele $A$ as $p_0 = 0.5$. Since there are only two alleles at this locus, the initial frequency of allele $a$ is $q_0 = 1 - p_0 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$.\n\nThe problem describes selection based on phenotype. The conspicuous phenotype (genotypes $AA$ and $Aa$) has a survival rate that is 20% lower than the camouflaged phenotype (genotype $aa$). We can quantify this by assigning relative fitness values ($w$) to each genotype. Let's set the fitness of the most successful genotype, the camouflaged $aa$, to 1.\n$w_{aa} = 1.0$\n\nThe fitness of the conspicuous genotypes ($AA$ and $Aa$) is 20% lower, which means their fitness is $1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\n$w_{AA} = 0.80$\n$w_{Aa} = 0.80$\n\nAssuming the population is initially in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of the three genotypes in the zygotes are:\nFrequency of $AA$ $= p_0^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25$\nFrequency of $Aa$ $= 2p_0q_0 = 2(0.5)(0.5) = 0.50$\nFrequency of $aa$ $= q_0^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25$\n\nAfter selection acts, the contribution of each genotype to the next generation's gene pool is proportional to its initial frequency multiplied by its relative fitness.
