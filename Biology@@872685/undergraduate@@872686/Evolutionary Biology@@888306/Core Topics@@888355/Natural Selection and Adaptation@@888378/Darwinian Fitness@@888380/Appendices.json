By working through this problem, you'll gain a quantitative understanding of how natural selection can favor different strategies based on their net reproductive output.", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the life history of a rare species of annual plant, *Silene novellus*. This plant species exhibits a fixed energy budget for reproduction and displays a genetic polymorphism that results in two distinct reproductive strategies.\n\nThe first strategy, termed the \"high-yield\" strategy, involves the production of a large number of small, lightweight seeds. Individuals with this genotype produce, on average, 150 seeds per plant. These seeds have a low provisioning of nutrients, and extensive field studies have shown their probability of surviving to germination and establishment of a new seedling is 4%.\n\nThe second strategy, termed the \"high-investment\" strategy, involves producing a smaller number of large, nutrient-rich seeds. Individuals with this genotype produce, on average, 25 seeds per plant. Due to the significant nutrient stores, these seeds have a much higher probability of survival, measured at 28%.\n\nAssuming that these survival probabilities are constant and that all other factors are equal, determine which reproductive strategy results in a higher absolute fitness, defined here as the total number of surviving offspring produced by an average individual.\n\nA. The \"high-yield\" strategy is superior.\n\nB. The \"high-investment\" strategy is superior.\n\nC. Both strategies result in equal absolute fitness.\n\nD. The relative fitness cannot be determined without information on the population size.", "solution": "Absolute fitness, defined as the expected number of surviving offspring per individual, is given by the expected value of a binomial process: if each seed survives independently with probability $p$ and $N$ seeds are produced, then the expected number of survivors is $E = Np$.\n\nFor the high-yield strategy:\nThe number of seeds is $N_{y} = 150$ and the survival probability is $p_{y} = 0.04 = \\frac{4}{100} = \\frac{1}{25}$. Therefore,\n$$\nE_{y} = N_{y} p_{y} = 150 \\cdot 0.04 = 6.\n$$\n\nFor the high-investment strategy:\nThe number of seeds is $N_{i} = 25$ and the survival probability is $p_{i} = 0.28 = \\frac{28}{100} = \\frac{7}{25}$. Therefore,\n$$\nE_{i} = N_{i} p_{i} = 25 \\cdot 0.28 = 7.\n$$\n\nSince $E_{i} = 7 > E_{y} = 6$, the high-investment strategy yields higher absolute fitness under the given assumptions.

This problem [@problem_id:1917447] challenges you to calculate and compare the lifetime reproductive success for two distinct life cycles: a semelparous octopus and an iteroparous nautilus. Mastering this calculation is key to understanding the evolution of different life histories in response to varying survival and fecundity schedules.", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying the life history strategies of two marine cephalopods: a species of octopus that exhibits semelparity (a single reproductive event followed by death) and a species of nautilus that exhibits iteroparity (multiple reproductive events over its lifetime). The biologist has collected demographic data for females of both species.\n\nFor the semelparous octopus:\n- The maximum lifespan is 2 years. Individuals reproduce only at the end of their second year of life.\n- The probability of a newly hatched female octopus surviving to her first birthday is $p_{_O, 1} = 0.10$.\n- The probability of a one-year-old female surviving to her second birthday is $p_{_O, 2} = 0.80$.\n- A female that survives to age 2 produces, on average, $M_O = 300$ female offspring before dying.\n\nFor the iteroparous nautilus:\n- The maximum lifespan is 4 years. Individuals begin reproducing at age 2 and continue to reproduce annually until they die after their fourth year.\n- The annual survival probability for a female nautilus of any age is constant, $p_{_N} = 0.90$.\n- A female nautilus that is age 2 or older produces, on average, $M_N = 15$ female offspring each year.\n\nAssuming these demographic rates are constant, calculate the ratio of the nautilus's lifetime reproductive success to the octopus's lifetime reproductive success. The lifetime reproductive success is defined as the total expected number of female offspring produced by a single newborn female throughout her entire life. Give your answer as a numerical value rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Define lifetime reproductive success (LRS) as the expected total number of female offspring produced by a single newborn female over her life.\n\nFor the semelparous octopus, reproduction occurs once at the end of year 2. The probability a newborn survives to that event is the product of annual survival probabilities, so the survival to reproduction is $p_{O,1}p_{O,2}$. Hence the octopus LRS is\n$$\n\\text{LRS}_{O} = M_{O}\\,p_{O,1}p_{O,2}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $p_{O,1}=0.10$, $p_{O,2}=0.80$, and $M_{O}=300$,\n$$\n\\text{LRS}_{O} = 300 \\times 0.10 \\times 0.80 = 300 \\times 0.08 = 24.\n$$\n\nFor the iteroparous nautilus, reproduction occurs once at the end of each of years 2, 3, and 4, with constant annual survival $p_{N}$. The probability a newborn is alive at the end of year $k$ is $p_{N}^{k}$.

This practice [@problem_id:1917454] delves into a complex, realistic scenario of a hybrid zone, where mating preferences and the sterility of hybrids impact the fitness of the parent species. By solving this, you will learn how to quantify the fitness consequences of interbreeding and understand its role in maintaining species boundaries.", "problem": "In Lake Victoria, two closely related species of cichlid fish, which we will call species A and species B, were historically separated by clear water conditions that allowed for visual mate recognition. Due to increased water turbidity from environmental changes, the visual barriers have weakened, leading to the formation of a hybrid zone where both species coexist and occasionally interbreed.\n\nAn ecological study in this hybrid zone provides the following data. The local breeding population consists of $N_A = 450$ individuals of species A and $N_B = 150$ individuals of species B. Females of species A exhibit a degree of assortative mating; they are more likely to choose a male of their own species. This preference is quantified by a mating coefficient, $\\alpha = 4.0$, meaning a species A female is four times more likely to mate with a species A male than a species B male, given an equal number of both. Assume the probability of a female of species A mating with a male of either species is proportional to the male's population size, weighted by this preference coefficient.\n\nFurther analysis reveals the following fitness components:\n- Offspring from a pure A x A cross have a juvenile survival probability (viability) of $V_A = 0.20$ and an average lifetime fecundity of $F_A = 50$ offspring per successful adult.\n- Offspring from an interspecies A x B cross (F1 hybrids) exhibit hybrid vigor (heterosis), showing an enhanced juvenile survival probability of $V_H = 0.30$. However, all F1 hybrids are found to be completely sterile.\n\nCalculate the mean relative fitness of the species A population in this hybrid contact zone. The relative fitness is defined as the mean absolute fitness of a species A individual in the contact zone, divided by the absolute fitness it would have in a theoretical environment where species B is absent. The final answer should be a dimensionless value.
