{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The modern understanding of life's three domains—Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya—is rooted in molecular evidence, not just observable structures like the presence or absence of a nucleus. This practice challenges you to think like a pioneering molecular evolutionist faced with a completely novel life form. By evaluating different molecular targets, you will identify the single most robust tool for placing an organism on the universal tree of life, reinforcing the foundational principle upon which the three-domain system was built [@problem_id:1975267].", "problem": "An astrobiologist is analyzing a sample returned from a distant moon, believed to harbor subterranean oceans. Within the sample, a viable, unicellular, self-replicating organism is isolated. Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals it has a cell membrane and cytoplasm, but lacks a visible nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles like mitochondria or chloroplasts. The biologist's primary goal is to determine if this new life form belongs to the domain Bacteria, Archaea, or if it represents a novel branch of life entirely. To achieve this, the biologist plans to perform a single, decisive molecular analysis. Which of the following molecular targets would provide the most robust and informative data for placing this organism within the universal tree of life?\n\nA. The sequence of a gene found within its mitochondrial Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA).\nB. The chemical structure of its primary cell wall polymer.\nC. The gene sequence encoding the small ribosomal subunit Ribonucleic Acid (rRNA).\nD. The presence or absence of genes encoding for histone proteins.\nE. The total number of unique types of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) polymerase enzymes it produces.", "solution": "Goal: choose a single molecular target that most robustly and informatively places an unknown, unicellular, membrane-bound but organelle-lacking organism within the universal tree of life, distinguishing Bacteria, Archaea, or a novel lineage.\n\nPrinciple of molecular phylogeny: robust deep phylogenetic placement requires a universally conserved, vertically inherited, slowly evolving informational macromolecule present in all cellular life, with conserved regions for reliable alignment across distant taxa and variable regions to resolve relationships. The canonical target that satisfies these constraints and underpins the three-domain framework is the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (16S rRNA in prokaryotes, 18S rRNA in eukaryotes), as demonstrated by Woese and colleagues. This marker is present in all known cellular life, encodes an essential component of the ribosome, resists horizontal gene transfer relative to many metabolic genes, and provides both conserved and hypervariable regions enabling universal primer design and phylogenetic inference across all domains.\n\nEvaluate each option against these criteria:\n\nA. A mitochondrial DNA gene requires the presence of mitochondria. The organism lacks membrane-bound organelles, so mitochondrial DNA is not expected. Even if such a gene were found, it would trace the evolutionary history of a eukaryotic endosymbiont lineage (derived from Alphaproteobacteria), not place a prokaryote-like organism or a novel lineage universally. It is therefore inapplicable and non-universal.\n\nB. The chemical structure of the primary cell wall polymer is not sufficiently robust for universal phylogeny. Bacteria often have peptidoglycan, whereas Archaea can have pseudopeptidoglycan or S-layers with diverse compositions; some Bacteria lack cell walls, and convergent or divergent evolution of wall components is common. This trait is ecological and biochemical, prone to homoplasy, and lacks the resolution and universality needed for deep phylogenetic placement.\n\nC. The gene sequence encoding the small ribosomal subunit rRNA is universal in cellular life, functionally constrained, and contains conserved and variable regions enabling multiple-sequence alignment and model-based phylogenetic inference across the tree of life. This is the standard and most informative single-locus framework for assigning organisms to Bacteria, Archaea, or Eukarya and for detecting novel deep lineages.\n\nD. Presence or absence of histone genes is not decisive. Many Archaea possess histone-like proteins; Bacteria typically lack canonical histones but have other DNA-binding proteins (for example, HU, IHF), and the distribution of histone homologs is patchy with possible horizontal transfers and convergent functional analogs. Gene presence/absence is a coarse and potentially misleading character for deep phylogeny compared to sequence-based phylogenetics of universal genes.\n\nE. The total number of RNA polymerase enzymes is not a single, definitive phylogenetic discriminator for universal placement. Bacteria have a single multi-subunit RNA polymerase; Archaea typically have one that resembles eukaryotic RNA polymerase II; eukaryotes have multiple nuclear RNA polymerases. Counting enzymes does not provide the breadth, resolution, or universality afforded by small subunit rRNA gene phylogeny and can be confounded by gene duplications, losses, or functional specialization.\n\nConclusion: the small ribosomal subunit rRNA gene sequence is the single most robust and informative molecular target for placing the organism within the universal tree of life and distinguishing Bacteria, Archaea, or a novel lineage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1975267"}, {"introduction": "Simply categorizing life into three distinct domains only scratches the surface of their intricate evolutionary history. The origin of the eukaryotic cell, for instance, represents a monumental fusion event between two of these domains. This problem delves into the chimeric nature of the eukaryotic genome, where different parts of our cellular machinery have clear ancestries in either the Archaea or Bacteria, and asks you to evaluate the leading hypothesis that explains this fascinating mosaic [@problem_id:1975282]. Understanding this solves a major puzzle about our own origins and highlights the dynamic, symbiotic processes that drive major evolutionary transitions.", "problem": "Phylogenetic analyses of eukaryotic genomes have revealed a fundamental dichotomy. Genes involved in information processing, such as those encoding core ribosomal proteins, DNA polymerases, and RNA polymerases (collectively termed \"informational genes\"), show the highest sequence similarity to genes from the Archaea domain, particularly the Asgard superphylum. In contrast, many genes involved in core metabolic processes, such as enzymes for glycolysis and amino acid biosynthesis (collectively termed \"operational genes\"), as well as all genes encoded within the mitochondrial genome, show the highest sequence similarity to genes from the Bacteria domain.\n\nWhich of the following hypotheses provides the most parsimonious and widely accepted scientific explanation for this chimeric nature of the eukaryotic genome?\n\nA. The Archezoa Hypothesis, which posits that the earliest-diverging eukaryotes were primitively amitochondriate, and the endosymbiotic event that introduced the mitochondrion occurred only in a sub-lineage of later eukaryotes.\nB. The Proto-Eukaryote Hypothesis, which proposes that the eukaryotic lineage arose from a unique, non-archaeal ancestral cell that had already evolved a nucleus and cytoskeleton before it later engulfed the alpha-proteobacterial ancestor of the mitochondrion.\nC. The Eocyte (or Syntrophy) Hypothesis, which posits that the eukaryotic cell arose from within the Archaea domain through a symbiotic fusion between an archaeal host cell and an alpha-proteobacterial guest, which subsequently became the mitochondrion.\nD. The Convergent Evolution Hypothesis, which argues that the observed molecular similarities are not due to shared ancestry but are the result of independent evolutionary pressures causing archaeal and eukaryotic informational systems to converge on a similar design, and bacterial and eukaryotic metabolisms to converge on similar pathways.\nE. The Universal Gene Pool Hypothesis, which suggests that the last common ancestor of all life was a community of pre-cellular entities that exchanged genes freely, and the three domains \"crystallized\" with different, coincidental assortments of informational and operational genes from this common pool.", "solution": "We are asked to identify the most parsimonious and widely accepted explanation for the chimeric origin of the eukaryotic genome, in which informational genes are archaeal-like (especially Asgard-related) and operational genes, including mitochondrial ones, are bacterial-like.\n\nFirst, apply the principle of parsimony and the well-supported endosymbiotic framework: a single event of endosymbiosis involving an alpha-proteobacterium that became the mitochondrion explains why mitochondrial genes are bacterial. Endosymbiotic gene transfer from the mitochondrial ancestor to the host nucleus explains why many nuclear-encoded operational genes also show bacterial affinity. Meanwhile, the archaeal-like nature of informational genes aligns with an archaeal host lineage, particularly Asgard archaea in modern phylogenies. This combination is most directly captured by a model in which eukaryotes arose from within Archaea via symbiogenesis with an alpha-proteobacterium.\n\nEvaluate each option against these criteria:\n- A (Archezoa Hypothesis): Posits primitively amitochondriate early eukaryotes and a later mitochondrial acquisition in only some lineages. This is contradicted by extensive evidence that all extant eukaryotes descend from a mitochondriate ancestor, with amitochondriate forms being secondarily derived. It does not parsimoniously explain the pervasive bacterial signature in operational genes across eukaryotes.\n- B (Proto-Eukaryote Hypothesis): Invokes a unique, non-archaeal proto-eukaryote with advanced features prior to mitochondrial acquisition. This fails to account for the strong archaeal affinity of informational genes, especially their association with Asgard archaea, and is less parsimonious than an archaeal host.\n- C (Eocyte or Syntrophy Hypothesis): Proposes eukaryotes arose from within Archaea via a syntrophic symbiosis between an archaeal host (providing informational systems) and an alpha-proteobacterial endosymbiont (becoming the mitochondrion, contributing metabolic pathways). This directly explains the archaeal nature of informational genes, the bacterial nature of operational genes, and the mitochondrial origin, and it aligns with the two-domain tree of life supported by phylogenomics.\n- D (Convergent Evolution Hypothesis): Convergence cannot plausibly account for pervasive, gene-by-gene sequence homology patterns across core informational and operational systems; shared ancestry is the supported explanation.\n- E (Universal Gene Pool Hypothesis): While gene exchange likely occurred early, this does not parsimoniously explain the specific and consistent archaeal-versus-bacterial partitioning observed in eukaryotic genomes, nor the central role of mitochondrial endosymbiosis.\n\nTherefore, the most parsimonious and widely accepted explanation is the Eocyte or Syntrophy hypothesis in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1975282"}, {"introduction": "In fields like metagenomics, scientists analyze complex environmental samples containing DNA from thousands of unknown species.

The goal is to classify a short, uncharacterized Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) fragment into one of the three domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria, or Eukarya.
