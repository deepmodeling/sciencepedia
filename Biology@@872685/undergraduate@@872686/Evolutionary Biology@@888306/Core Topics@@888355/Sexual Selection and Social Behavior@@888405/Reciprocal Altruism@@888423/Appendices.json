To test this principle, we must move beyond qualitative descriptions and into quantitative analysis. This first practice problem provides a foundational exercise in calculating the expected fitness payoffs for individuals in a reciprocal exchange, using a classic hypothetical example from the study of animal behavior [@problem_id:1877294]. By assigning numerical values to the cost ($c$), benefit ($b$), and probability of reciprocation ($p$), you can determine whether cooperation is a winning strategy from an individual's perspective.", "problem": "In studies of animal behavior, reciprocal altruism is a model used to explain cooperative acts between unrelated individuals. Consider a simplified model of blood-sharing in a colony of vampire bats, where fitness gains and losses are quantified in abstract 'energy units'. The cost to a donor bat for sharing a blood meal is denoted by $c$. The benefit to the recipient, which is often near starvation, is denoted by $b$.\n\nNow, consider a single interaction sequence between two unrelated bats, Bat A and Bat B. Bat A is known to be a 'cooperator' and initiates the sequence by sharing its meal with Bat B. Bat B, however, does not always reciprocate. For any given act of kindness it receives, the probability that Bat B will reciprocate in a future encounter is $p$. Assume the act of reciprocation, if it occurs, involves the same cost and benefit values.\n\nGiven the following parameters:\n- Cost of donation, $c = 8$ energy units\n- Benefit of reception, $b = 30$ energy units\n- Probability of reciprocation, $p = 0.75$\n\nCalculate the expected net fitness change for Bat A and the expected net fitness change for Bat B from this entire interaction sequence, which is initiated by Bat A.

The expected value of a quantity that depends on probabilistic outcomes is calculated by summing the products of each possible outcome's value and its probability of occurrence.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the expected net fitness change for Bat A. The interaction sequence involves two parts for Bat A: the initial definitive cost and the potential future benefit.\n1.  Bat A initiates the sharing. This is a certain event. The cost to Bat A is $c$, so its fitness changes by $-c$.\n2.  Bat B may or may not reciprocate later. The benefit to Bat A depends on Bat B's action.\n    -   With probability $p$, Bat B reciprocates, and Bat A receives a benefit of $b$.\n    -   With probability $(1-p)$, Bat B does not reciprocate, and Bat A receives no benefit (a change of 0).\nThe expected benefit for Bat A from this probabilistic event is the sum of (value of outcome $\\times$ probability of outcome):\n$$E[\\text{Benefit for A}] = (b \\times p) + (0 \\times (1-p)) = pb$$\nThe total expected net fitness change for Bat A, denoted $E_A$, is the sum of the initial cost and the expected future benefit:\n$$E_A = -c + pb$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$E_A = -8 + (0.75)(30) = -8 + 22.5 = 14.5$$\nSo, the expected net fitness change for Bat A is 14.5 energy units.\n\nNext, let's analyze the expected net fitness change for Bat B.

The benefit to Bat B is $b$, so its fitness changes by $+b$.\n2.  Bat B may or may not reciprocate later. The cost to Bat B depends on its own action.\n    -   With probability $p$, Bat B reciprocates, incurring a cost of $c$. The fitness change associated with this cost is $-c$.\n    -   With probability $(1-p)$, Bat B does not reciprocate, incurring no cost (a change of 0).\nThe expected fitness change for Bat B from its own potential action is:\n$$E[\\text{Cost for B}] = (-c \\times p) + (0 \\times (1-p)) = -pc$$\nThe total expected net fitness change for Bat B, denoted $E_B$, is the sum of the initial benefit and the expected future cost:\n$$E_B = b - pc$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$E_B = 30 - (0.75)(8) = 30 - 6 = 24$$\nSo, the expected net fitness change for Bat B is 24 energy units.\n\nThe final answer is the pair of expected net fitness changes for Bat A and Bat B, respectively.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 14.5  24 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1877294"}, {"introduction": "While calculating payoffs for a single scenario is useful, evolutionary theory seeks general rules that predict when cooperation can evolve and persist. Game theory, specifically the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, provides the framework for deriving such rules. This problem challenges you to analyze the stability of a cooperative strategy known as 'Grim Trigger' against invasion by a purely selfish 'Always Defect' strategy [@problem_id:1959351]. Your goal is to derive a critical threshold for the probability of future interaction ($w$), often called the 'shadow of the future,' which demonstrates mathematically why long-term relationships are essential for the evolution of reciprocity.", "problem": "In an evolutionary model of social behavior, two individuals engage in a series of interactions. In each round, an individual can either 'Cooperate' (C) or 'Defect' (D). The payoff for an interaction is determined by a matrix, where the payoffs for the row player are given by:\n\n- If both cooperate, each receives a 'Reward' payoff, $R$.\n- If both defect, each receives a 'Punishment' payoff, $P$.\n- If one cooperates and the other defects, the cooperator receives a 'Sucker's' payoff, $S$, and the defector receives a 'Temptation' payoff, $T$.\n\nThe payoffs are ordered such that $T  R  P  S$. After each round of interaction, there is a constant probability, $w$, that the two individuals will interact again in a future round. Consequently, the probability that the interaction terminates after any given round is $(1-w)$.\n\nConsider a population composed almost entirely of individuals using the 'Grim Trigger' (GT) strategy. A GT player cooperates on the first move and continues to cooperate as long as its opponent has cooperated in all previous moves. If the opponent defects even once, the GT player will defect in all subsequent rounds.\n\nNow, a rare mutant individual employing the 'Always Defect' (AD) strategy is introduced into this population. An AD player defects on every move, regardless of the opponent's past actions. For the GT strategy to be stable and resist invasion by the AD strategy, the expected lifetime payoff for a GT individual interacting with another GT individual must be greater than the expected lifetime payoff for the rare AD mutant interacting with a GT individual.\n\nDetermine the critical threshold for the probability of future interaction, $w$, above which the 'Grim Trigger' strategy can resist invasion by 'Always Defect'. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $T$, $R$, and $P$.", "solution": "Define the expected lifetime payoff of a repeated interaction with continuation probability $w$ as the sum over rounds of the per-round payoff weighted by the probability the round occurs.

Altruistic-looking behaviors can often be explained by alternative mechanisms, most notably kin selection. This final exercise puts you in the role of a field ecologist tasked with designing an experiment to disentangle these competing hypotheses [@problem_id:1877290]. Evaluating the potential outcomes will sharpen your ability to distinguish the unique, contingent nature of reciprocal altruism—where help is specifically returned by those who received it—from other forms of cooperation.", "problem": "An ecologist is studying helping behavior in a species of bird, the fictitious Sapphire-Winged Finch. In this species, some breeding pairs are assisted by a \"helper\" bird, which aids in nest defense and feeding the chicks but does not breed itself. The ecologist wants to determine whether this altruistic behavior is driven by kin selection or reciprocal altruism, particularly in cases where the helper is not related to the breeding pair.\n\nThe ecologist designs a long-term field experiment with two phases. In Phase 1, she identifies and creates territories for several breeding pairs. For each pair, she introduces a subordinate, unrelated helper bird from a different population. She then observes and records the interactions for the entire breeding season. In Phase 2, which takes place during the following breeding season, she tracks the same individuals. Some of the helper birds from Phase 1 have now managed to secure their own territories and mates. The ecologist's goal is to observe the behavior of the birds that received help in Phase 1 towards these new breeding pairs.\n\nWhich of the following hypothetical outcomes from this experiment would provide the strongest evidence that helping behavior in unrelated Sapphire-Winged Finches is maintained by reciprocal altruism?\n\nA. In Phase 1, helpers that provide the most food to the chicks are observed to have a higher social standing and are less likely to be attacked by the dominant breeding pair.\n\nB. In Phase 1, the presence of an unrelated helper significantly increases the number of chicks that fledge, and the helper itself benefits from a higher survival rate over the winter compared to solitary birds.\n\nC. In Phase 2, individuals that received a large amount of help in Phase 1 are significantly more likely to act as helpers for their original helper's new nest than would be expected by chance.\n\nD. Genetic analysis reveals that even birds presumed to be unrelated helpers are, on average, distant cousins to the breeding pair, sharing more genes than random individuals from the population.", "solution": "We first define the competing hypotheses and their key predictions.\n\nKin selection predicts that helping behavior is favored when helpers are genetically related to recipients, because helping increases inclusive fitness through shared genes. A critical prediction is that helpers will preferentially assist relatives or individuals more related than average.\n\nReciprocal altruism predicts that individuals help non-kin contingent on past interactions, specifically that help is repaid over time. Key predictions include: (i) help given now increases the probability of help received later when roles reverse, (ii) the magnitude of help received predicts the magnitude or likelihood of later help given back, and (iii) this contingency persists after controlling for relatedness.\n\nWe now evaluate each option against these predictions.\n\nOption A states that in Phase 1, helpers that provide the most food gain higher social standing and suffer fewer attacks from the dominant pair. This indicates immediate direct benefits to the helper mediated by social dynamics, which is consistent with pay-to-stay, prestige, or mutualism. It does not demonstrate a delayed, contingent return of aid when roles reverse, so it does not uniquely support reciprocal altruism.\n\nOption B states that in Phase 1, the presence of an unrelated helper increases fledging success and the helper has higher winter survival. This shows mutual benefits and could reflect byproduct mutualism or group augmentation, but it does not show that help is contingent on later reciprocation by specific individuals. Therefore it does not strongly support reciprocal altruism.\n\nOption C states that in Phase 2, individuals that received a large amount of help in Phase 1 are significantly more likely to act as helpers for their original helper’s new nest than expected by chance. This matches the core prediction of direct reciprocal altruism: help given earlier is repaid later by the specific recipient when roles reverse, and the likelihood of reciprocation scales with the amount of prior help. This is the strongest evidence for reciprocal altruism among unrelated individuals.\n\nOption D reveals unexpected relatedness among “unrelated” helpers and recipients, supporting kin selection rather than reciprocal altruism. It undermines the premise of unrelated helping and does not provide evidence for reciprocity.\n\nTherefore, the outcome most strongly supporting reciprocal altruism is Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1877290"}]}
