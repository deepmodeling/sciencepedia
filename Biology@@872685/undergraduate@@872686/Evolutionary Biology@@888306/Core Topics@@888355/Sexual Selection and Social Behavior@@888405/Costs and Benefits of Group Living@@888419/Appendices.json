The choice is based on maximizing net daily energy intake.\n\nA solitary forager gathers an average of $F_S$ food items per day. The acquisition of each food item incurs an energetic cost of $C_S$.\n\nWhen living in a group, foraging is more efficient due to cooperative effects. Each of the two group members (both dominant and subordinate) gathers an average of $F_G$ food items per day, but the energetic cost per item is reduced to $C_G$. Within this group, a dominance hierarchy is established, compelling the subordinate individual to cede a fraction, $\\alpha$, of all the food it gathers to the dominant individual. Each food item, regardless of how it is acquired, provides an energy value of $V$.\n\nAn individual will opt for the strategy that yields a higher net daily energy intake, calculated as the total energy from the food an individual ultimately possesses minus its total energetic cost of foraging. Determine the maximum possible value of the fraction $\\alpha$ for which joining the group is at least as beneficial as living a solitary life for the subordinate individual.

A male's reproductive success is threatened by two main factors: nest predation and extra-pair copulations (EPCs) by his mate.\n\nFrom long-term studies, the biologist has determined the following:\n1. For a solitary pair nesting alone, the probability of the entire nest being lost to predation during the season is $p_{p, \\text{solitary}} = 0.40$.\n2. For any pair nesting within a colony (regardless of its size or the pair's position), the collective defense and dilution effects reduce the probability of nest predation to $p_{p, \\text{colonial}} = 0.15$.\n3. Living in a colony, however, increases the risk of EPCs. For each adjacent neighboring nest, there is an independent probability $p_e = 0.05$ that a male's mate will engage in an EPC with the male from that specific neighboring nest. The occurrence of an EPC with one neighbor is independent of an EPC with any other neighbor.

Consider a fictional species of highly social bird, the Azure-Crested Manakin (*Aureocrista caerulea*). The fitness of an individual in this species is strongly dependent on the size of its social group. We can model the net fitness contribution, $W(N)$, for an individual in a group of size $N$ as the difference between a benefit function $B(N)$ and a cost function $C(N)$.\n\nThe primary benefit of group living is enhanced predator detection through collective vigilance. As the group size $N$ increases, the total vigilance increases, but with diminishing returns for each additional member. This benefit is modeled by the function $B(N) = k_1 \\ln(N)$, where $k_1$ is a positive constant representing the efficacy of collective vigilance and $\\ln$ denotes the natural logarithm.\n\nThe primary cost arises from the cognitive stress associated with tracking the complex web of social relationships. The number of pairwise relationships an individual must monitor grows quadratically with group size. This cognitive and social load is modeled as a cost function $C(N) = k_2 N^2$, where $k_2$ is a positive constant representing the per-relationship cognitive cost.\n\nAssuming that natural selection will favor the group size that maximizes the net fitness for an individual member, determine the optimal group size, $N_{opt}$.
