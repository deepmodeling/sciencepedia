Through genetic sequencing, the biologist has reconstructed the evolutionary history of these populations, all of which descended from a single ancestral population that colonized the islands. The Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC) defines a species as the smallest diagnosable monophyletic group sharing a common ancestor. For the purpose of this problem, assume each numbered population is a diagnosable unit.\n\nThe evolutionary relationships are as follows:\n- An ancestral population first split into two lineages. One lineage led to modern-day Population 1. The other lineage gave rise to all other populations.\n- The second lineage then split, with one branch leading to Population 2, and the other giving rise to the remaining populations.\n- This remaining group subsequently diverged into two major clades.\n- The first clade consists of two sister populations: Population 3 and Population 4.\n- The second clade is composed of three populations. Within this second clade, Population 5 is the most basal member, having diverged before the most recent common ancestor of Population 6 and Population 7.\n\nBased on this phylogenetic history, how many distinct species of lizard would be recognized on the Galara Archipelago according to the Phylogenetic Species Concept?", "solution": "According to the Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC), a species is the smallest diagnosable monophyletic group sharing a common ancestor. The problem explicitly states that each numbered population is a diagnosable unit. In a rooted phylogeny, terminal populations that are diagnosable and monophyletic are the smallest diagnosable clades because they contain no further diagnosable subunits.\n\nGiven the described tree:\n- Population 1 is a terminal diagnosable lineage.\n- Population 2 is a terminal diagnosable lineage.\n- Populations 3 and 4 are terminal diagnosable lineages within their clade.\n- Populations 5, 6, and 7 are terminal diagnosable lineages within the second clade, with Population 5 basal to the clade containing Populations 6 and 7.\n\nWhile larger clades (e.g., the clade comprising Populations 6 and 7) may also be monophyletic and potentially diagnosable, they are not the smallest diagnosable units because each contains smaller diagnosable monophyletic groups (the individual populations). Therefore, under the PSC, each terminal diagnosable population corresponds to a distinct species.\n\nCounting the diagnosable terminal populations gives Populations 1 through 7, for a total of 7 species.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7}$$", "id": "1954334"}, {"introduction": "Moving from abstract trees to tangible data, this problem explores how fixed genetic differences are used as diagnostic characters to delimit species.

These fish inhabit two geographically isolated, high-altitude river systems: the Crystal River and the Sunstone River. The two rivers have had no connection for the last 50,000 years.

Populations C and S share a more recent common ancestor with each other than either does with the outgroup, Population G.\n2.  All individuals sampled from Population C possess a unique allele, designated `F-ATPase-c`, which is fixed in this population.

The phylogeny shows that Populations C and S share a more recent common ancestor with each other than with the outgroup G. This establishes that C and S together form a clade relative to G, but PSC assigns species status at the smallest diagnosable units, not necessarily at the level of a larger clade that contains subdivided, diagnosable terminal units.\n2.

This practice challenges you with such a scenario, where nuclear DNA suggests two distinct oak species, but mitochondrial DNA hints at historical interbreeding. Your task is to apply the PSC by weighing the evidence to determine the most likely species history, learning how to navigate gene tree-species tree discordance and justify a taxonomic conclusion [@problem_id:1954322].", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying two populations of oaks that are each other's closest relatives. One population, which she provisionally names *Quercus altus*, is found only at high elevations, while the other, *Quercus humilis*, is found only in adjacent low-lying valleys. To determine their species status, she sequences both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA from multiple individuals of both populations.\n\nThe phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear DNA, which represents the overall genetic history of the organisms, shows that all individuals of *Q. altus* form a single, well-supported monophyletic group, and all individuals of *Q. humilis* also form their own well-supported monophyletic group. The two groups are reciprocally monophyletic.\n\nHowever, the analysis of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is maternally inherited, reveals a different pattern. While the *Q. altus* individuals still form a monophyletic group, the *Q. humilis* lineage is paraphyletic. Specifically, the mtDNA of some *Q. humilis* individuals is nested within the *Q. altus* clade, making the *Q. altus* clade and these few *Q. humilis* individuals a sister group to the rest of the *Q. humilis* individuals. This pattern is strong evidence of historical hybridization and the flow of genes (introgression) from *Q. altus* mothers to *Q. humilis* populations.\n\nThe biologist decides to apply the Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC). For the purpose of this problem, the PSC defines a species as the smallest diagnosable monophyletic group of organisms within which there is a parental pattern of ancestry and descent.\n\nBased on a strict application of the Phylogenetic Species Concept to the evidence provided, which of the following conclusions is the most appropriate?\n\nA. They should be classified as one species, because the presence of historical gene flow means they are not fully reproductively isolated.\n\nB.

They should be classified as two distinct species, because they occupy different ecological niches (mountains vs. valleys), which is the primary criterion for speciation.", "solution": "The core of this problem is to apply the Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC) to a scenario with conflicting genetic signals, a common challenge in modern systematics.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC)**\nThe problem provides a working definition of the PSC: \"a species is the smallest diagnosable monophyletic group of organisms...\". The key operational criterion here is **monophyly**. A monophyletic group, or a clade, is a group consisting of an ancestor and ALL of its descendants. Under the PSC, for a population to be recognized as a distinct species, it must form a monophyletic group that is distinct from all other such groups.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Genetic Evidence**\nThere are two sources of genetic data that give conflicting results (a situation known as gene tree-species tree discordance).\n- **Nuclear DNA:** This represents thousands of genes from across the genome and is generally considered the best indicator of the overall evolutionary history of the organism (the \"species tree\"). The nuclear DNA analysis shows that *Q. altus* is monophyletic and *Q. humilis* is monophyletic. This is a pattern of reciprocal monophyly, which is strong evidence for two separate lineages under the PSC.\n- **Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA):** This represents a single, maternally inherited locus (a \"gene tree\"). The mtDNA analysis shows that *Q. altus* is monophyletic, but *Q. humilis* is **paraphyletic**. This means the *Q. humilis* group does not contain all descendants of its common ancestor; some of its descendants are in the *Q. altus* group (or more accurately, some individuals identified as *Q. humilis* carry mitochondria that phylogenetically belong to the *Q. altus* lineage). This is a classic signature of introgression, where hybridization has occurred and genes from one population have crossed into the other.\n\n**Step 3: Reconcile the Conflicting Data and Apply the PSC**\nThe conflict arises because the species tree (inferred from nuclear DNA) and one of the gene trees (mtDNA) do not match. Biologists must decide which line of evidence is more representative of the species boundary.\n- The mtDNA represents the history of just the mitochondrion. Because it is a single genetic unit, its history can be different from the history of the organism as a whole due to processes like introgression or incomplete lineage sorting.\n- The nuclear DNA, comprising the vast majority of the genome, reflects the history of the population of organisms.\nA pragmatic application of the PSC, even a \"strict\" one, prioritizes the evidence that best reflects the overall \"parental pattern of ancestry and descent\" for the entire organism. The nuclear genome's signal of reciprocal monophyly is the strongest evidence for two distinct, historically isolated lineages that have maintained their integrity despite a limited instance of mitochondrial exchange. The paraphyly of the mtDNA is best interpreted as a historical event (introgression) that has affected a single gene region but has not erased the overall differentiation of the two lineages. Therefore, the most defensible conclusion under the PSC is that there are two species, diagnosed by the monophyly of their nuclear genomes.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Options**\n- **A. They should be classified as one species, because the presence of historical gene flow means they are not fully reproductively isolated.** This invokes the criterion of reproductive isolation, which is the cornerstone of the Biological Species Concept (BSC), not the PSC. The PSC is concerned with historical patterns of ancestry (monophyly), not the current potential for interbreeding. Therefore, this option is incorrect as it misapplies a different species concept.\n- **B. They should be classified as two distinct species, because the two populations are reciprocally monophyletic according to the nuclear DNA, which reflects the overall organismal lineage history.** This option correctly identifies the nuclear DNA as the most robust indicator of the species' lineage history and applies the PSC criterion of monophyly to this data. It correctly interprets the mtDNA signal as a case of gene tree-species tree discordance that does not override the primary pattern. This is the best conclusion.\n- **C. They should be classified as one species, because the *Q. humilis* population is not a monophyletic group according to the mitochondrial DNA, and thus the only diagnosable monophyletic group is the one that contains all individuals from both populations.** This represents an overly literal and brittle interpretation of the \"monophyly\" rule. While it is true that the mtDNA makes *Q. humilis* not diagnosable as monophyletic *based on that single gene*, this ignores the stronger, genome-wide evidence. In systematics, species are hypotheses, and all available evidence must be weighed. The nuclear data provides a much stronger basis for a two-species hypothesis. This option incorrectly prioritizes a single anomalous gene tree over the species tree.\n- **D. They should be classified as two distinct species, because they occupy different ecological niches (mountains vs. valleys), which is the primary criterion for speciation.** This invokes the criterion of ecological distinctiveness, which is the basis of the Ecological Species Concept (ESC). While the ecological information is relevant context, it is not the defining criterion of the PSC. Therefore, this option is incorrect as it applies the wrong species concept.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1954322"}]}
