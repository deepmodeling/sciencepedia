This exercise demonstrates a fundamental technique used by evolutionary biologists: the creation of a hybrid index. By measuring continuous morphological traits, such as the tail and ear length in deer mice, we can quantitatively score an individual's position on a spectrum between the two parent species, providing a powerful first look into the structure of a hybrid zone [@problem_id:1939417].", "problem": "An ecologist is studying a potential hybrid zone between two closely related species of deer mice. The forest-dwelling species, *Peromyscus sylvaticus*, is adapted for climbing and has, on average, a longer tail and smaller ears. The field-dwelling species, *Peromyscus campestris*, is adapted for open terrain and has a shorter tail and larger ears.\n\nTo quantify the morphological characteristics of individuals from the zone of overlap, the ecologist develops a Hybrid Index ($HI$). This index scales an individual's traits relative to the average traits of the two parental species. The phenotype of a pure *P. sylvaticus* is assigned a score of 0, and the phenotype of a pure *P. campestris* is assigned a score of 1.\n\nThe reference measurements from pure populations are as follows:\n- *P. sylvaticus*: Mean tail length ($\\mu_{TL,syl}$) = 105 mm; Mean ear length ($\\mu_{EL,syl}$) = 15 mm.\n- *P. campestris*: Mean tail length ($\\mu_{TL,cam}$) = 75 mm; Mean ear length ($\\mu_{EL,cam}$) = 22 mm.\n\nThe score for each trait is calculated by scaling the individual's measurement ($X_i$) relative to the means of the two parental populations ($\\mu_{syl}$ and $\\mu_{cam}$).\n1.  The standardized score for tail length ($S_{TL}$) is given by: $S_{TL} = \\frac{\\mu_{TL,syl} - TL_{i}}{\\mu_{TL,syl} - \\mu_{TL,cam}}$\n2.  The standardized score for ear length ($S_{EL}$) is given by: $S_{EL} = \\frac{EL_{i} - \\mu_{EL,syl}}{\\mu_{EL,cam} - \\mu_{EL,syl}}$\n\nThe overall Hybrid Index ($HI$) is the average of these two standardized scores: $HI = \\frac{S_{TL} + S_{EL}}{2}$.\n\nAn individual mouse is captured in the contact zone with a tail length ($TL_i$) of 87 mm and an ear length ($EL_i$) of 19 mm. Calculate the Hybrid Index for this individual. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The Hybrid Index is defined as the mean of the standardized trait scores:\n$$HI=\\frac{S_{TL}+S_{EL}}{2},$$\nwith\n$$S_{TL}=\\frac{\\mu_{TL,syl}-TL_{i}}{\\mu_{TL,syl}-\\mu_{TL,cam}}, \\quad S_{EL}=\\frac{EL_{i}-\\mu_{EL,syl}}{\\mu_{EL,cam}-\\mu_{EL,syl}}.$$\n\nSubstituting the given values for tail length,\n$$S_{TL}=\\frac{105-87}{105-75}=\\frac{18}{30}=\\frac{3}{5}=0.6.$$\n\nSubstituting the given values for ear length,\n$$S_{EL}=\\frac{19-15}{22-15}=\\frac{4}{7}.$$\n\nCompute the Hybrid Index:\n$$HI=\\frac{\\frac{3}{5}+\\frac{4}{7}}{2}=\\frac{\\frac{21}{35}+\\frac{20}{35}}{2}=\\frac{\\frac{41}{35}}{2}=\\frac{41}{70}\\approx 0.585714\\ldots.$$\n\nRounding to three significant figures gives\n$$HI\\approx 0.586.$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.586}$$", "id": "1939417"}, {"introduction": "While some traits vary continuously, others fall into discrete categories, such as flower color or leaf shape. This practice explores how to adapt the hybrid index concept for such categorical data, using a classic example from plant biology [@problem_id:1939450]. By assigning scores to different phenotypic states, we can still construct a robust, normalized index to assess an individual's ancestry, highlighting the versatility of this analytical tool.", "problem": "In a mountain valley, two distinct species of paintbrush flowers, *Castilleja montis* and *Castilleja vallis*, are known to hybridize. To study the genetic makeup of the hybrid population, botanists have developed a simple hybrid index based on three key morphological traits.\n\nThe parental species are characterized as follows:\n- ***Castilleja montis* (Species M):** Possesses scarlet bracts, entire (smooth-edged) leaves, and a glabrous (hairless) stem.\n- ***Castilleja vallis* (Species V):** Possesses yellow bracts, deeply lobed leaves, and a pubescent (hairy) stem.\n\nFor each of the three traits (bract color, leaf shape, stem texture), a score is assigned to an individual plant based on its phenotype:\n- A score of 0 is given for a trait identical to Species M.\n- A score of 1 is given for a trait that is intermediate between the two parental species (e.g., orange bracts, shallowly lobed leaves, sparsely hairy stem).\n- A score of 2 is given for a trait identical to Species V.\n\nThe overall hybrid index for an individual is calculated by summing the scores for the three traits and then normalizing this sum by dividing it by the maximum possible total score. This results in an index ranging from 0 (pure Species M) to 1 (pure Species V).\n\nAn ecologist samples a particular plant from the hybrid zone and records its traits as follows:\n- Bract Color: Orange\n- Leaf Shape: Deeply lobed\n- Stem Texture: Sparsely hairy\n\nCalculate the normalized hybrid index for this sampled plant.
