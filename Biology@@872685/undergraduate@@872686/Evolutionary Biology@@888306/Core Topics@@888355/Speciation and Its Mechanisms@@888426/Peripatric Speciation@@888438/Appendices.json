This exercise presents a classic geographical scenario involving a population split, challenging you to apply the core definition of peripatric speciation—the formation of a new species from a small, peripheral isolate—and differentiate it from large-scale vicariance. By analyzing the relative sizes of the newly isolated populations, you will practice identifying the signature conditions that initiate this unique evolutionary pathway [@problem_id:1953026].", "problem": "A large, continuous population of a hypothetical amphibian species, the Ridgeback Salamander, occupies a wide, low-lying river valley. A major geological event causes the main river to dramatically alter its course, carving a new, impassable channel through the center of the salamanders' habitat. This event creates two reproductively isolated populations. One population, now located west of the new river, is large, comprising thousands of individuals and retaining most of the ancestral population's genetic diversity. The other population, now trapped in a newly formed, small oxbow lake east of the new river, is very small, consisting of fewer than one hundred individuals. Over many generations, the two populations are observed to diverge genetically.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes a specific mode of speciation that is likely occurring?\n\nA. The large western population is undergoing peripatric speciation.\n\nB. Both populations are undergoing sympatric speciation.\n\nC. The small oxbow lake population is undergoing peripatric speciation.\n\nD. The small oxbow lake population is undergoing parapatric speciation.\n\nE. Both populations are undergoing an identical mode of allopatric speciation, and no more specific term applies.", "solution": "First, recall definitions of speciation modes:\n- Allopatric speciation occurs when a physical barrier divides a population, eliminating gene flow; it includes two common scenarios:\n  - Vicariant allopatry: a geographic barrier splits a population into two sizable subpopulations.\n  - Peripatric speciation: a small, isolated founder population becomes separated at the periphery of the original range, with strong effects of genetic drift and founder events.\n- Parapatric speciation involves adjacent populations with limited gene flow and a selection gradient across a cline, not a complete barrier.\n- Sympatric speciation occurs without geographic separation; populations remain in the same area with ongoing potential contact.\n\nApply these to the scenario:\n- A new, impassable river divides a continuous population into two reproductively isolated groups. This is allopatric speciation.\n- One group is large (thousands) and retains most ancestral diversity; the other is very small (fewer than one hundred) and is isolated in a small oxbow lake.\n- The small size of the eastern oxbow population implies strong genetic drift and founder effects, which is characteristic of peripatric speciation.\n- The large western population does not fit peripatric criteria because it is not a small founder isolate; it is the majority remnant of the ancestral population.\n- The presence of an impassable barrier rules out both sympatric and parapatric speciation (no shared habitat and no clinal contact zone).\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A is incorrect: the large western population is not peripatric.\n- B is incorrect: sympatric speciation is inconsistent with an impassable barrier.\n- C is correct: the small oxbow lake population fits peripatric speciation.\n- D is incorrect: parapatric speciation requires adjacent populations with some gene flow, which is absent.\n- E is incorrect: although both are allopatric, a more specific term applies to the small isolated population (peripatric), so they are not undergoing identical modes.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the small oxbow lake population is undergoing peripatric speciation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1953026"}, {"introduction": "A founding event is not a guarantee of successful colonization or speciation; in fact, it is a genetically perilous moment for a new population. This problem explores the significant risks faced by a small group of founders, focusing on how the founder effect and subsequent inbreeding can lead to rapid extinction, even in an ideal environment [@problem_id:1953001]. You will investigate the role of deleterious recessive alleles and understand why the \"genetic revolution\" proposed for founder populations is often a high-stakes gamble.", "problem": "A small group of 12 diploid, sexually-reproducing mammals (6 males and 6 females) from a large, genetically diverse mainland population becomes isolated on a small, remote island. The island is rich in resources and free of predators, presenting an ideal environment for colonization. In the mainland population, there exists a gene critical for metabolic function. A specific recessive allele, denoted as $m$, is present at this locus. When an individual is homozygous for this allele (genotype $mm$), it suffers from a fatal metabolic syndrome and does not survive to reproductive age. The frequency of this deleterious allele $m$ in the large mainland population is $q = 0.02$.\n\nBy random chance during the founding event, one of the 12 founding individuals is a heterozygous carrier of this allele (genotype $Mm$), while the other 11 are homozygous dominant ($MM$). Despite the favorable environmental conditions, the island population struggles to grow and goes extinct within five generations.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most direct and significant genetic explanation for the failure of this founder population?\n\nA. Strong directional selection on the island rapidly favored a new phenotype that was not present in the genetic makeup of the 12 founders.\n\nB. The complete lack of gene flow from the mainland prevented the introduction of new, beneficial mutations required for adapting to the island.\n\nC. The founder effect caused an immediate, random increase in the frequency of the deleterious 'm' allele, and subsequent inbreeding among the founders' descendants increased the likelihood of producing non-viable homozygous 'mm' offspring.\n\nD. High rates of random mutation following the colonization event introduced numerous new harmful alleles that quickly drove the population to extinction.\n\nE. Stabilizing selection was too strong in the new environment, preventing the population from diversifying and leading to a collapse in fitness.", "solution": "We identify the core evolutionary genetics mechanisms and quantify their immediate consequences for the founding population.\n\nPrinciples and equations used:\n- Founder effect: a form of genetic drift in which allele frequencies in a small founder sample differ randomly from the source population.\n- Inbreeding and genotype frequencies: if the inbreeding coefficient is $F$, then with allele frequencies $p$ and $q$ (with $p+q=1$), expected genotype frequencies are $P(\\text{AA})=p^{2}+Fpq$, $P(\\text{Aa})=2pq(1-F)$, and $P(\\text{aa})=q^{2}+Fpq$.\n- Heterozygosity decay and inbreeding increase in a small closed population: $H_{t}=H_{0}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2N_{e}}\\right)^{t}$ and $F_{t}=1-\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2N_{e}}\\right)^{t}$, where $N_{e}$ is the effective population size.\n\nStep-by-step genetic reasoning applied to the scenario:\n1) Initial allele frequency shift due to the founder effect. In the founders, there are $2N$ gene copies with $N=12$. Exactly one $m$ allele is present (the single heterozygote), so the initial island frequency is\n$$\nq_{0}=\\frac{1}{2N}.\n$$\nGiven $N=12$, this is $q_{0}=\\frac{1}{24}$. This differs from the mainland frequency $q=0.02$; the founder sampling has randomly increased the deleterious allele frequency. This is the founder effect.\n\n2) Consequence of small population size: rapid rise in inbreeding. In a closed, very small population, $N_{e}$ is small, so $F_{t}=1-\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2N_{e}}\\right)^{t}$ increases rapidly with $t$. This elevates homozygosity and reduces heterozygosity $H_{t}$. Because the population is small and closed, mating among relatives becomes common, so $F_{t}$ becomes appreciable within a few generations.\n\n3) Expression of recessive lethality under inbreeding. With allele frequencies $p=1-q$ and $q$ for the $M$ and $m$ alleles, the expected frequency of lethal homozygotes is\n$$\nP(mm)=q^{2}+Fpq.\n$$\nUnder random mating ($F=0$), $P(mm)=q^{2}$ is small when $q$ is small. However, in a small, inbred population, the term $Fpq$ increases the frequency of $mm$ above $q^{2}$. Because $mm$ individuals die before reproduction, each generation experiences inbreeding depression.\n\n4) Demographic feedback and extinction risk. The death of $mm$ zygotes reduces the number of breeders, which further reduces $N_{e}$, increasing $F_{t}$ even faster (an extinction vortex). Even if selection removes $mm$ each generation, the demographic cost in a tiny, closed population can prevent growth and drive extinction within a few generations.\n\n5) Evaluation of alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because selection cannot immediately favor a phenotype that is absent from the founders’ genetic variation; the problem explicitly frames extinction without requiring a novel phenotype.\n- B is incorrect because gene flow introduces existing alleles, not new mutations, and the environment is already favorable; lack of gene flow is not the primary cause here.\n- D is incorrect because mutation rates are too low to generate “numerous new harmful alleles” that drive rapid extinction; drift and inbreeding are the dominant forces at this timescale and size.\n- E is incorrect because stabilizing selection maintaining existing phenotypes does not explain rapid extinction in an otherwise favorable environment; the key mechanism is inbreeding depression exposing recessive lethals.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and significant genetic explanation is the founder effect increasing the deleterious allele frequency combined with subsequent inbreeding elevating $mm$ mortality.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1953001"}, {"introduction": "Geographic isolation initiates divergence, but what happens if the barrier disappears before reproductive isolation is complete? This final practice examines the critical test of secondary contact, where a once-isolated peripheral population reunites with its large ancestral source [@problem_id:1953073]. By considering the powerful homogenizing effect of gene flow, you will learn why the establishment of reproductive isolating barriers is the ultimate deciding factor in whether a temporary divergence becomes a permanent speciation event.", "problem": "A large, genetically diverse population of a particular species of flightless beetle inhabits a vast, continuous temperate forest. Due to a sudden and massive landslide, a small peripheral group of 50 beetles becomes geographically isolated in a secluded valley. This new, isolated population is cut off from the main ancestral population, preventing any gene flow between them. The environment in the valley is nearly identical to the main forest, so there are no strong new selective pressures on the isolated group.\n\nAfter a period of 100 generations, a brief but intense period of geological activity causes the land bridge to the valley to be restored, allowing the now-differentiated peripheral population to come back into secondary contact with the much larger ancestral population. Assume the following:\n1. The ancestral population size has remained large and stable.\n2. The individuals from the two populations are still capable of mating and producing viable, fertile offspring.\n3. The only significant evolutionary force acting to differentiate the isolated population was genetic drift.\n4. The 100-generation separation is considered a very short time on an evolutionary scale for this species.\n\nWhich of the following describes the most likely long-term evolutionary outcome for the peripheral population's distinct gene pool upon re-establishing contact with the ancestral population?\n\nA. The two populations will hybridize extensively, and their gene pools will merge back into one, effectively erasing the divergence that occurred in isolation.\n\nB. The two populations will evolve stronger pre-zygotic isolating mechanisms, leading to the completion of speciation, because any hybrid offspring are slightly less fit.\n\nC. A stable, narrow hybrid zone will form where the two populations meet, with limited gene flow occurring between them.\n\nD. The individuals from the ancestral population will outcompete the individuals from the peripheral population, driving the latter to extinction.\n\nE. The peripheral population will be immediately recognized as a new species by the ancestral population, and no interbreeding will occur.", "solution": "We begin by identifying the evolutionary forces and constraints described. The isolated population was small, with census size $N \\approx 50$, and the only significant differentiating force during isolation was genetic drift. The ancestral population remained large and experienced no significant drift-induced shifts (by assumption of large, stable size). The environment remained similar, and individuals from both populations can interbreed to produce viable, fertile offspring, indicating no post-zygotic isolation and no strong pre-zygotic barriers.\n\nPrinciple 1: Genetic drift causes random changes in allele frequencies with a magnitude that scales inversely with effective population size. The per-generation variance in allele frequency change under drift scales as $\\operatorname{Var}(\\Delta p) \\propto \\frac{p(1-p)}{2N_{e}}$, so a small isolated population (with $N_e$ on the order of the census size $N$) can accumulate some random divergence. However, the separation time is only $100$ generations, which is short on the evolutionary timescale for a species with large ancestral populations; thus, the magnitude of divergence is expected to be modest and primarily neutral.\n\nPrinciple 2: Upon secondary contact with no reproductive isolation and with viable, fertile offspring, gene flow acts to homogenize allele frequencies between populations. This is captured by the standard migration model. Let $p_I(t)$ be the allele frequency in the isolated population at generation $t$ after secondary contact, and $p_A$ the allele frequency in the ancestral population (assumed approximately constant due to its very large size). If $m$ is the proportion of genes in the isolated population each generation that derive from migrants from the ancestral population, then the recursion is\n$$\np_{I}(t+1) = (1 - m)\\,p_{I}(t) + m\\,p_{A}.\n$$\nThis implies the difference from the ancestral frequency decays geometrically:\n$$\np_{I}(t) - p_{A} = (1 - m)^{t}\\,\\big(p_{I}(0) - p_{A}\\big),\n$$\nso $p_I(t) \\to p_A$ as $t \\to \\infty$, with the rate of convergence governed by $m$. Because the ancestral population is very large relative to the peripheral population, the effective $m$ into the peripheral population is nontrivial, while the reverse flow into the large ancestral population produces negligible change in $p_A$. Therefore, gene flow will rapidly swamp drift-induced differences in the small population, merging its gene pool back toward the ancestral state.\n\nPrinciple 3: A stable hybrid zone requires a balance between dispersal and selection against hybrids or ecologically based spatially varying selection. Here, assumptions include no strong new selective pressures and no reduction in hybrid fitness (individuals are viable and fertile), so there is no selection maintaining a cline; thus, a stable, narrow hybrid zone is not expected.\n\nPrinciple 4: Reinforcement (evolution of stronger pre-zygotic isolation) requires selection against hybrids. Given viable, fertile hybrids and no stated reduction in hybrid fitness, reinforcement is not favored, especially over a short timescale. Moreover, the divergence arose via drift rather than divergent selection, further reducing the likelihood of reinforcement.\n\nPrinciple 5: Competitive exclusion driving the peripheral population to extinction would require consistent fitness disadvantages or ecological inferiority. With similar environments and drift-driven differences presumed mostly neutral, there is no basis for systematic outcompetition; instead, the primary effect is genetic swamping via gene flow.\n\nSynthesizing these principles, the most likely long-term outcome is extensive interbreeding with the large ancestral population, leading to homogenization and effective erasure of the drift-induced divergence. This corresponds to option A. Alternatives B, C, D, and E are inconsistent with the assumptions: B requires selection against hybrids; C requires a balance of dispersal and selection; D requires a fitness disadvantage; E contradicts the given interbreeding capability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1953073"}]}
