{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Reproductive isolation often begins with changes in behavior. This practice explores behavioral isolation, a powerful prezygotic barrier where differences in courtship rituals prevent populations from interbreeding. By analyzing a hypothetical mate-choice experiment with guppies, you will learn to predict the outcomes that signal the evolution of distinct mating preferences, a critical first step in the divergence of species. [@problem_id:1960475]", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying two geographically separate populations of guppies, *Poecilia reticulata*. The first population, \"Crimson Creek,\" is exposed to high levels of predation, and the males have evolved muted coloration and a rapid, twitchy courtship dance. The second population, \"Azure Pool,\" lives in a predator-free environment, and its males have evolved brilliant, iridescent colors and a slow, elaborate courtship dance. The two populations are known to be able to produce viable, fertile offspring when crossed in a laboratory setting.\n\nTo test for the presence of behavioral isolation, the biologist designs a mate-choice experiment. A single virgin female from one of the populations is placed in the central chamber of an aquarium. This central chamber is connected to two side chambers, each containing a single male—one from Crimson Creek and one from Azure Pool. Clear, non-porous partitions separate the chambers, allowing the female to see both males and their courtship displays but preventing any chemical or physical contact. The amount of time the female spends near the partition of each male is recorded over a 30-minute period as a proxy for her mating preference. The experiment is repeated multiple times with different virgin females from both Crimson Creek and Azure Pool.\n\nIf strong behavioral isolation has evolved between these two populations, which of the following outcomes is the most likely result of this experiment?\n\nA. Females from both populations will spend approximately equal time interacting with each male, showing no significant preference.\n\nB. Crimson Creek females will strongly prefer Crimson Creek males, and Azure Pool females will strongly prefer Azure Pool males.\n\nC. Females from both populations will consistently prefer the more vibrantly colored Azure Pool males.\n\nD. Crimson Creek females will strongly prefer Crimson Creek males, but Azure Pool females will show no preference between the two types of males.\n\nE. No meaningful interactions will be observed, as females will typically hide or remain motionless for the duration of the experiment.", "solution": "Behavioral isolation is a prezygotic isolating mechanism in which differences in mating signals and preferences reduce the likelihood of interbreeding. In this system, males in the two populations differ in visual courtship traits (coloration and display behavior), and females potentially exhibit assortative preferences for these traits.\n\nThe experiment isolates visual and behavioral cues by using clear, non-porous partitions that prevent chemical or physical contact. Thus, any preference measured via spatial association time reflects female response to visual courtship traits, directly testing behavioral isolation.\n\nLet $T_{C\\to C}$ denote the time a Crimson Creek female spends near the Crimson Creek male, and $T_{C\\to A}$ the time she spends near the Azure Pool male. Similarly, let $T_{A\\to A}$ denote the time an Azure Pool female spends near the Azure Pool male, and $T_{A\\to C}$ the time she spends near the Crimson Creek male. Spatial association time is used as a proxy for mating preference: greater time indicates stronger preference.\n\nPrediction under strong behavioral isolation: females from each population preferentially attend to, and hence would prefer to mate with, males from their own population, because divergent courtship signals and female preferences coevolve. Therefore, we expect\n$$T_{C\\to C} > T_{C\\to A} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad T_{A\\to A} > T_{A\\to C}.$$\nThis outcome corresponds to reciprocal assortative preferences, consistent with strong behavioral isolation.\n\nAlternative outcomes are less consistent with strong behavioral isolation:\n- Equal time with both males (no significant preference) would indicate no behavioral isolation.\n- A universal preference for the more colorful Azure Pool males would indicate a general sensory bias rather than population-specific behavioral isolation.\n- Asymmetrical preference (e.g., only Crimson Creek females preferring conspecific males) would indicate partial or asymmetric isolation, not strong reciprocal behavioral isolation.\n- No interaction would suggest an experimental artifact or stress response, not informative about behavioral isolation.\n\nThus, the most likely result consistent with strong behavioral isolation is that females from both populations prefer males from their own population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1960475"}, {"introduction": "When prezygotic barriers fail, postzygotic mechanisms come into play, often by reducing the fitness of hybrid offspring. This exercise focuses on hybrid sterility, a common postzygotic barrier, and challenges you to translate a biological observation into a precise evolutionary cost. By calculating the selection coefficient against partially sterile hybrid flycatchers, you will gain a quantitative understanding of how natural selection acts to prevent the mixing of gene pools. [@problem_id:1960439]", "problem": "Two historically isolated populations of a species of flycatcher, let's call them the Upland Flycatcher (Population U) and the Lowland Flycatcher (Population L), have come into secondary contact in a valley. Individuals from both populations can interbreed, but they exhibit a form of postzygotic reproductive isolation. Extensive field and lab studies have revealed the following:\n\n1.  First-generation (F1) hybrid offspring resulting from U-L crosses are fully viable and reach sexual maturity at the same rate as purebred offspring (from U-U or L-L crosses).\n2.  Mating success is random within the contact zone; males of all types (purebred U, purebred L, and F1 hybrid) are equally successful at securing mates.\n3.  F1 hybrid females are just as fertile as purebred females.\n4.  F1 hybrid males, however, exhibit partial sterility. On average, they produce only 10.0% of the number of viable sperm found in the ejaculates of purebred males.\n\nAssume that a male's reproductive success is determined solely by the number of eggs he can fertilize, and that this is directly proportional to the number of viable sperm he produces. Under this assumption, calculate the selection coefficient, $s$, acting against the F1 hybrid male genotype due to this reduced fertility. Report your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Define relative fitness as proportional to realized reproductive success. Because viability and mating success are equal across male types and reproductive success is assumed directly proportional to the number of viable sperm produced, set the purebred male’s relative fertility to $1$ and the F1 hybrid male’s relative fertility to $0.100$.\n\nThus, the F1 hybrid male’s relative fitness is\n$$\nw_{\\text{hyb}}=0.100.\n$$\nThe selection coefficient against the F1 hybrid male genotype is defined by\n$$\ns=1-w_{\\text{hyb}}=1-0.100=0.900.\n$$\nThis uses the given that F1 females are unaffected and all other fitness components (viability, mating success) are equal, so only male fertility reduces fitness.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.900}$$", "id": "1960439"}, {"introduction": "Reproductive isolating mechanisms are not static; they evolve in response to selection. This final practice explores reinforcement, a key evolutionary process where selection against unfit hybrids drives the evolution of stronger prezygotic barriers. You will analyze a classic scenario involving firefly flash patterns to understand how the costly consequences of hybridization can accelerate divergence between species where they live together. [@problem_id:1960493]", "problem": "In an extensive tropical forest, two closely related species of firefly, *Photinus alpha* and *Photinus beta*, have geographic ranges that are largely separate but overlap in a central zone of sympatry. In their respective allopatric zones (where only one species is present), the flashing patterns used by males to attract females are very similar in rhythm and color. However, extensive field studies have revealed a striking pattern: in the sympatric zone, the flash pattern of *P. alpha* is significantly faster and more yellow, while the pattern of *P.beta* is slower and more green, making them easily distinguishable. Genetic analysis confirms that while interspecies mating can occur, the resulting hybrid larvae have a significantly lower survival rate to adulthood compared to purebred larvae.\n\nWhich of the following evolutionary mechanisms provides the most accurate explanation for the observed divergence in flash patterns within the zone of sympatry?\n\nA. Reinforcement\n\nB. Genetic Drift\n\nC. High Gene Flow\n\nD. Ecological Character Displacement\n\nE. Allopatric Speciation", "solution": "The critical observations are: (i) in allopatry, the mating flash signals of Photinus alpha and Photinus beta are similar; (ii) in sympatry, the signals diverge markedly (alpha becomes faster and more yellow; beta becomes slower and more green), making species recognition easy; (iii) interspecific mating is possible, but hybrid larvae have substantially lower survival to adulthood, indicating reduced hybrid fitness.\n\nNatural selection acting to avoid the production of low-fitness hybrids favors any prezygotic traits that reduce heterospecific mating where the species co-occur. This process is termed reinforcement, and its phenotypic signature is reproductive character displacement: mating signals diverge more strongly in zones of sympatry than in allopatry to enhance assortative mating. The observed divergence in flash patterns specifically in sympatry, aligned with evidence of reduced hybrid fitness, matches the hallmark prediction of reinforcement.\n\nAlternative mechanisms are less consistent with the pattern. Genetic drift produces random divergence and does not predict consistent, directional divergence specifically in sympatry counter to homogenizing effects. High gene flow would homogenize signals rather than generate increased divergence in the contact zone. Ecological character displacement refers to divergence in resource-use or competitive niche traits due to interspecific competition, not primarily to mating signals driven by selection against hybridization; thus it does not directly account for the link to reduced hybrid fitness. Allopatric speciation describes divergence due to geographic isolation and cannot explain the enhanced divergence of mating signals uniquely within sympatry driven by selection to avoid maladaptive hybridization.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate mechanism explaining the sympatry-specific divergence in mating signals, given reduced hybrid fitness, is reinforcement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1960493"}]}
