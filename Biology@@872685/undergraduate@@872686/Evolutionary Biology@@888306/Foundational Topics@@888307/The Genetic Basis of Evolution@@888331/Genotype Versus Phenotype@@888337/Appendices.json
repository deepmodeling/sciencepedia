This exercise explores epistasis, a phenomenon where the effect of one gene is modified by one or several other genes. By analyzing a classic case of flower color inheritance in sweet peas, you will see how gene interactions can lead to surprising phenotypic outcomes that reveal underlying biochemical pathways. [@problem_id:1935481]", "problem": "In a particular species of flowering plant, the synthesis of a purple flower pigment is controlled by a two-step biochemical pathway. A colorless precursor molecule is first converted into a colorless intermediate by the action of Enzyme C. This intermediate is then converted into the final purple pigment by Enzyme P. The production of a functional Enzyme C is determined by a dominant allele, $C$, at one genetic locus, while the recessive allele, $c$, results in a non-functional enzyme. Similarly, the production of a functional Enzyme P is determined by a dominant allele, $P$, at a second, independently assorting genetic locus, while the recessive allele, $p$, results in a non-functional enzyme. Any disruption in this pathway results in white flowers.\n\nAn experiment is conducted where a true-breeding white-flowered plant from one pure line is crossed with a true-breeding white-flowered plant from a different pure line. All of the resulting F1 generation plants have purple flowers. These F1 plants are then allowed to self-pollinate to produce an F2 generation.\n\nWhat is the expected phenotypic ratio of purple-flowered plants to white-flowered plants in the F2 generation?\n\nA. 9 purple : 7 white\n\nB. 9 purple : 3 light purple : 3 pink : 1 white\n\nC. 3 purple : 1 white\n\nD. 1 purple : 1 white\n\nE. 1 purple : 3 white", "solution": "Let the two independently assorting loci be $C/c$ and $P/p$. Because the pigment pathway is serial (precursor $\\xrightarrow{\\text{Enzyme C}}$ intermediate $\\xrightarrow{\\text{Enzyme P}}$ pigment), a functional enzyme is required at both steps to obtain purple flowers. Thus:\n- Purple phenotype occurs only for genotypes with at least one dominant allele at each locus, i.e., $C\\_P\\_$.\n- Any genotype with $cc$ (no Enzyme C) or with $pp$ (no Enzyme P) results in a pathway block and hence white flowers.\n\nThe observation that crossing two different true-breeding white lines yields all-purple F1 indicates complementation: one line is homozygous recessive at $C$ but not $P$, and the other is homozygous recessive at $P$ but not $C$.

This practice delves into the concept of polygenic inheritance, where multiple genes contribute additively to a single phenotype. Through a simplified hypothetical model, you will discover how simple Mendelian segregation at several loci can explain how offspring can exhibit phenotypes more extreme than those of their parents, a phenomenon known as transgressive segregation. [@problem_id:1935470]", "problem": "Consider a simplified genetic model for a quantitative trait, such as height, in a hypothetical organism. The organism's height is determined by a baseline height of 150 cm, plus an additional height contribution from a set of four unlinked gene loci: A, B, C, and D. Each locus has two possible alleles: an additive allele (denoted with a subscript '1', e.g., $A_1$) that contributes 5 cm to the final height, and a non-additive allele (denoted with a subscript '0', e.g., $A_0$) that contributes 0 cm to the final height. The effects of the additive alleles are cumulative, and there are no dominance effects.\n\nTwo parent organisms both exhibit a phenotype of exactly 170 cm in height. They produce an offspring that has a height of 185 cm.\n\nAssuming no new mutations occurred, which of the following statements provides the most accurate genetic explanation for how the parents could produce an offspring with this substantially different phenotype?\n\nA. The parents are likely heterozygous at multiple loci controlling height. By chance, during meiosis, the offspring inherited a combination of gametes that resulted in a greater total number of additive alleles than was present in either parent's diploid genome.\n\nB. Height is a trait showing blending inheritance. Therefore, it is impossible for the offspring to be this tall, and the measurement must be an error, as the offspring's height must lie between the parental heights.\n\nC. The additive alleles ($A_1, B_1$, etc.) are recessive to the non-additive alleles. Both parents were heterozygous carriers, and the offspring inherited the correct combination of recessive alleles to express the tall phenotype.\n\nD. Environmental factors must be responsible. The offspring was raised in a significantly better environment than its parents, which caused the over-expression of its height genes, leading to the taller phenotype.\n\nE. The parents' genotypes were homozygous for different sets of alleles that averaged out to the same height. The offspring's height resulted from combining these different homozygous alleles. For example, one parent was $A_1A_1B_1B_1C_0C_0D_0D_0$ and the other was $A_0A_0B_0B_0C_1C_1D_1D_1$.", "solution": "Let $N_{1}$ denote the total number of additive alleles (the alleles with subscript $1$) across the four unlinked loci in a diploid organism.

This problem puts you in the role of an ecologist tasked with resolving this very issue for an observed correlation between a mother's size and her offspring's success. You will critically evaluate different experimental designs to determine which one most powerfully isolates the influence of genetic inheritance from the influence of the environment provided by parental care. [@problem_id:1935465]", "problem": "In studies of a fictional bird species, the \"Crimson-Crested Warbler,\" ornithologists have consistently observed a strong positive correlation between the body mass of a female and the average survival rate of her offspring from hatching to fledging. Two primary hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon:\n\n1.  **The \"Good Genes\" Hypothesis**: Larger females possess genotypes that confer general fitness advantages (e.g., more robust immune systems, greater foraging efficiency). They pass these beneficial alleles to their offspring, which then inherently have a higher probability of survival, regardless of the quality of parental care they receive.\n2.  **The \"Maternal Care\" Hypothesis**: Larger females are phenotypically more capable parents. Their size allows them to better defend the nest against predators and to provision their nestlings with more food. This superior parental environment, which is non-genetic, is the primary driver of the increased offspring survival.\n\nYou are tasked with designing a field experiment to definitively distinguish which of these two hypotheses is the primary explanation for the observed pattern. Which of the following experimental designs is the most powerful and appropriate for separating the influence of the mother's genes from the influence of her parental care?\n\nA. Monitor a large number of warbler nests in the wild. For each nest, record the female's body mass, the rate at which she delivers food, nest predation events, and the final number of surviving fledglings. Use statistical analysis to determine whether female body mass or parental care behaviors are stronger predictors of offspring survival.\n\nB. Conduct a supplemental feeding experiment. For a randomly selected group of nests belonging to small females, provide a high-quality food supplement near the nest daily. Compare the fledgling survival rate in these supplemented nests to non-supplemented nests of other small females and the nests of large females.\n\nC. Perform a cross-fostering experiment. Locate a set of nests from large females and a set from small females that hatch on the same day. As soon as the chicks hatch, swap the entire clutches of chicks between nests of large and small females. For control, also monitor non-swapped nests of both large and small females. Track and compare the survival rates of all fledglings based on their genetic origin and their rearing environment.\n\nD. Implement a \"common garden\" experiment. Collect eggs from the nests of both large and small females just before they are due to hatch. Incubate the eggs in a controlled laboratory setting. After hatching, raise all chicks by hand under identical, standardized conditions, providing the same amount and type of food to each. Compare the survival rates of the chicks originating from large versus small mothers.", "solution": "The core challenge is to experimentally separate the genetic contribution of a mother from the environmental contribution she provides through parental care. To achieve this, we need an experimental design that makes these two factors independent of each other. Let's analyze each option.\n\n**Option A: Observational Study**\nThis approach is purely observational and correlational. While it might reveal that, for instance, food delivery rate is a strong predictor of offspring survival, it cannot establish causality or untangle the hypotheses. Larger females might be good at provisioning *because* they are large (supporting the Maternal Care hypothesis), but it's also possible that the genes that make them large and good providers are also the \"good genes\" that they pass to their offspring, which would independently increase survival (the Good Genes hypothesis). Since female size, provisioning ability, and genetic inheritance are all correlated in this design, it's impossible to isolate the true causal factor.\n\n**Option B: Supplemental Feeding**\nThis experiment directly tests one specific aspect of the Maternal Care hypothesis: food limitation. If supplemented nests of small females show offspring survival rates equal to those of large females, it provides strong evidence that food provisioning is a key component of the observed effect. However, this design is incomplete. First, parental care involves more than just food (e.g., nest defense, sanitation, brooding). If survival does not increase, it doesn't disprove the Maternal Care hypothesis, as other factors could be at play. Second, and more importantly, this design does not directly test the Good Genes hypothesis. It only manipulates the environment for one group and does not create the reciprocal conditions needed for a full comparison.\n\n**Option D: Common Garden Experiment**\nIn this design, all offspring are raised in an identical environment, completely removing the variable of post-hatching parental care. If offspring from large mothers still have higher survival rates under these hand-reared conditions, it would provide strong support for a pre-hatching effect. This could be due to the Good Genes hypothesis or a pre-hatching maternal effect (e.g., larger females laying more nutritious eggs). However, this experiment completely fails to test the proposed \"Maternal Care\" hypothesis, which is specifically about the *post-hatching* environment created by the mother. Therefore, it cannot distinguish between the two stated hypotheses.\n\n**Option C: Cross-Fostering Experiment**\nThis is the classic and most powerful design for this question. By swapping chicks between nests, the experiment creates four distinct groups for comparison:\n1.  Genetically from large mother, raised by large mother (control).\n2.  Genetically from small mother, raised by small mother (control).\n3.  Genetically from large mother, raised by small (foster) mother.\n4.  Genetically from small mother, raised by large (foster) mother.\n\nThis design orthogonally varies the genetic origin of the chicks and the environment (parental care quality) in which they are raised. We can now make clear predictions:\n-   If the \"Good Genes\" hypothesis is correct, chicks from large mothers (groups 1 and 3) should have high survival, while chicks from small mothers (groups 2 and 4) should have low survival, regardless of which mother raised them. Survival depends on the biological mother.\n-   If the \"Maternal Care\" hypothesis is correct, chicks raised by large mothers (groups 1 and 4) should have high survival, while chicks raised by small mothers (groups 2 and 3) should have low survival, regardless of their genetic origin. Survival depends on the foster mother.\n\nBy comparing the survival rates across these four groups, one can directly and powerfuly disentangle the effects of genetics from the effects of the post-hatching parental environment. Therefore, this is the most appropriate experimental design.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1935465"}]}
