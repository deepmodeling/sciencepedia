This exercise asks you to pinpoint the precise stage of meiosis that corresponds to Mendel's First Law, the segregation of alleles. Correctly identifying this event is crucial for understanding how genetic variation is generated and passed on from one generation to the next.", "problem": "In a hypothetical flowering plant, the gene for petal color has two alleles: a dominant allele $P$ for purple petals and a recessive allele $p$ for white petals. A primary germline cell from a heterozygous plant ($Pp$) enters meiosis to produce four gametes. For the purpose of this question, assume that no new mutations arise during the process. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the specific meiotic event that is the physical basis for the segregation of the $P$ and $p$ alleles into different gametes, as predicted by the chromosomal theory of inheritance?\n\nA. The process of DNA replication in the S phase, where the chromosome carrying the $P$ allele and the chromosome carrying the $p$ allele are both duplicated.\n\nB. The separation of homologous chromosomes during anaphase I.\n\nC. The alignment of individual chromosomes along the metaphase plate during metaphase II.\n\nD. The separation of sister chromatids during anaphase II.\n\nE. The exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes (crossing over) during prophase I.", "solution": "We consider a single locus with two alleles, $P$ (dominant) and $p$ (recessive), in a heterozygous plant with genotype $Pp$. Under the chromosomal theory of inheritance, each allele resides on one member of a homologous chromosome pair: one homolog carries the $P$ allele and the other homolog carries the $p$ allele.\n\nBefore meiosis, during the S phase, each chromosome is replicated so that each homolog becomes two sister chromatids. Specifically, the $P$-bearing chromosome becomes two sister chromatids both carrying $P$, and the $p$-bearing chromosome becomes two sister chromatids both carrying $p$. This DNA replication duplicates alleles but does not separate them into different cells, so it is not the physical basis of segregation. Therefore, option A is not correct.\n\nDuring meiosis I, homologous chromosomes pair in prophase I and align as bivalents at the metaphase plate in metaphase I. The key event for Mendel’s law of segregation is anaphase I, when homologous chromosomes separate and move to opposite poles. At this moment, the $P$-bearing homolog and the $p$-bearing homolog are physically segregated into different daughter cells. This separation of homologs is the physical basis for the segregation of alleles into different gametes as predicted by the chromosomal theory. Therefore, option B correctly identifies the event.\n\nBy contrast, metaphase II involves the alignment of individual chromosomes (each typically with two sister chromatids) at the metaphase II plate, but alignment itself does not effect segregation of alleles; hence option C does not describe the basis of segregation.\n\nAnaphase II is the separation of sister chromatids. In a standard meiosis without recombination within the locus, the two sister chromatids of a given chromosome carry the same allele at that locus (both $P$ or both $p$), so their separation does not constitute the initial segregation of the $P$ and $p$ alleles. Even if crossing over occurred between the locus and the centromere, the law of segregation still fundamentally arises from the separation of homologs in anaphase I; anaphase II resolves sister chromatids. Therefore, option D is not the primary physical basis of segregation.\n\nCrossing over during prophase I (option E) exchanges genetic material between homologs and increases genetic variation by recombining linked loci, but it is not necessary for nor does it constitute the segregation of alleles at a single locus. Segregation occurs whether or not crossing over takes place. Thus, option E is not correct.\n\nHence, the specific meiotic event that physically underlies allele segregation is the separation of homologous chromosomes in anaphase I.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1524330"}, {"introduction": "Mendel's Law of Segregation implies that which of a parent's two alleles is passed to an offspring is a matter of chance, analogous to a coin flip. While in a very large population these probabilities play out predictably, in a small population, this random sampling can lead to dramatic shifts in allele frequencies—a process known as genetic drift. This practice challenges you to quantify the effect of this Mendelian lottery in a small founding population, providing a tangible calculation of how quickly valuable genetic diversity can be lost [@problem_id:1946914].", "problem": "A conservation program initiates a new, isolated population of an endangered diploid species, the Azure Fritillary butterfly. The founding population consists of a single breeding pair: one male and one female (total population size $N=2$). Genetic screening shows that for a specific gene locus controlling antennal segment number, both founding butterflies are heterozygous. Let the two alleles at this locus be denoted by $B$ and $b$. Thus, both parents have the genotype $Bb$. These alleles are known to be selectively neutral.\n\nThe pair mates and produces a large number of offspring, from which two individuals survive to form the next generation, maintaining the constant population size of $N=2$. Assuming the gametes that form the offspring are a random draw from the parental gene pool, what is the probability that the allele $b$ is completely lost in this new generation? Express your answer as a simplified fraction.", "solution": "Both founders are heterozygous $Bb$, so the parental gene pool contains $2N=4$ gene copies: two $B$ alleles and two $b$ alleles. Thus the allele frequency of $b$ in the parental generation is $p=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe next generation consists of two diploid individuals, i.e., $2N=4$ gene copies. Under random mating and random union of gametes (selective neutrality and no segregation distortion), each of these $4$ gene copies is an independent draw from the parental gene pool with probability $p=\\frac{1}{2}$ of being $b$ and probability $1-p=\\frac{1}{2}$ of being $B$. Therefore, the number of $b$ alleles in the next generation, denoted $X$, follows a binomial distribution:\n$$\nX \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(4, p).\n$$\nComplete loss of $b$ in the new generation means $X=0$.

However, not all inheritance follows these rules, and recognizing the limits of a model is as important as knowing how to use it. This problem explores a scenario involving mitochondrial DNA to highlight the fundamental assumptions—specifically diploidy and biparental inheritance—that underpin standard population genetic models [@problem_id:1495628]. Analyzing why the familiar $p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$ framework breaks down is essential for appreciating its proper application and recognizing the diversity of inheritance patterns in nature.", "problem": "In a large, isolated population of a hypothetical rodent species, a particular metabolic function is controlled exclusively by a single gene located on the mitochondrial genome. This gene has two alleles: a functional wild-type allele, denoted as 'W', and a non-functional mutant allele, denoted as 'w', which leads to a mild, non-lethal metabolic inefficiency. A population biologist attempts to model the frequencies of these alleles and the prevalence of the metabolic condition using the standard Hardy-Weinberg Principle.\n\nWhich of the following foundational assumptions of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is most directly and fundamentally violated by the genetic basis of this specific trait, making the principle's standard formulation ($p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$) inapplicable?\n\nA. The population is sufficiently large to be unaffected by genetic drift.\n\nB. Mating between individuals occurs at random with respect to the mitochondrial alleles.\n\nC. There is no natural selection acting on the phenotypes associated with the 'W' and 'w' alleles.\n\nD. Alleles are inherited through Mendelian mechanisms, including diploidy and segregation from two parental gametes.\n\nE. No new mutations arise, and there is no migration of individuals into or out of the population.", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the primary assumption of the Hardy-Weinberg Principle (HWP) that is violated in the case of a trait determined by a mitochondrial gene.\n\nFirst, let's recall the core assumptions of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium model. The standard model, which leads to the genotype frequency equation $p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$ (where $p$ and $q$ are the frequencies of the two alleles), rests on several explicit and implicit assumptions for a population to be in equilibrium:\n1.  No natural selection.\n2.  No mutation.\n3.  No gene flow (migration).\n4.  Large (effectively infinite) population size to prevent genetic drift.\n5.  Random mating (panmixia).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental, often unstated, assumption upon which the entire mathematical framework of HWP is built: the organism must be diploid and follow Mendelian inheritance for the gene in question. The terms in the equation represent the probabilities of forming specific diploid genotypes from a random pool of gametes.\n-   $p^2$ represents the frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype (e.g., WW), formed by the union of two gametes both carrying the 'W' allele.\n-   $q^2$ represents the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (e.g., ww), formed by the union of two gametes both carrying the 'w' allele.\n-   $2pq$ represents the frequency of the heterozygous genotype (e.g., Ww), formed by the union of a 'W' gamete and a 'w' gamete.\n\nThis framework inherently assumes that an offspring receives one allele from its male parent and one allele from its female parent.\n\nNow, let's analyze the scenario described in the problem. The gene controlling the metabolic trait is located on the mitochondrial genome (mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA). In nearly all animals, mitochondria—and thus all the genes contained within them—are inherited maternally. The sperm contributes its nuclear DNA to the egg, but its mitochondria are typically destroyed shortly after fertilization and do not become part of the resulting zygote.\n\nThis mode of inheritance, known as maternal or uniparental inheritance, directly contradicts the foundational basis of the HWP model.\n-   **Violation of Diploidy and Biparental Inheritance:** An individual does not possess two copies of the mitochondrial gene, one from each parent. Instead, all of its mitochondria are inherited from the mother. An individual is effectively haploid for its mitochondrial genome.\n-   **Violation of Segregation:** The concept of alleles from two parents segregating and recombining to form new genotypes in the offspring is not applicable. An offspring simply inherits the maternal mitochondrial haplotype. A father cannot pass his mitochondrial 'W' or 'w' allele to his offspring.\n\nTherefore, the genotype frequencies cannot be calculated as $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2$. The entire mathematical structure of the Hardy-Weinberg principle breaks down because it is designed for diploid, biparental, Mendelian inheritance.\n\nLet's examine the other options:\n-   A, C, E: While violations of large population size (drift), no selection, and no mutation/migration would cause a population to deviate from HWP, the principle would still be the *correct theoretical model* to apply and test against. The problem here is more fundamental: the HWP model is structurally incorrect for mitochondrial genes from the start, even if all these other conditions were perfectly met.\n-   B: Mating itself can still be random. A male with a particular mitochondrial type can mate with any female, regardless of her mitochondrial type. The issue is not the choice of mates, but the mechanism of genetic transmission *after* mating. Therefore, the assumption of random mating is not the primary one being violated.\n\nThe most direct and fundamental violation is the assumption of diploidy and biparental inheritance, which is a core component of Mendelian genetics. This corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1495628"}]}
