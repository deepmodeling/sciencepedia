{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "While Gregor Mendel's principles of dominance and recessiveness form a cornerstone of genetics, many traits don't follow this simple binary. This problem explores incomplete dominance, a pattern where the heterozygous phenotype is an intermediate blend of the two homozygous parental phenotypes. By analyzing a hypothetical cross, you will learn to distinguish this key source of variation from other genetic interactions and appreciate how it generates novel traits. [@problem_id:1965007]", "problem": "In a species of bioluminescent fungus, the color of the light emitted is determined by a single gene. A researcher performs a cross between a pure-breeding strain that emits a deep blue light and another pure-breeding strain that emits a bright yellow light. All of the resulting offspring in the first filial (F1) generation emit a pale green light, a phenotype that is intermediate and distinct from both parents.\n\nWhich of the following genetic principles best describes the interaction between the alleles for light color in this fungus?\n\nA. Complete Dominance\n\nB. Pleiotropy\n\nC. Incomplete Dominance\n\nD. Codominance\n\nE. Epistasis", "solution": "The problem describes a classic non-Mendelian inheritance pattern. To identify the correct principle, we must analyze the relationship between the parental phenotypes and the offspring's phenotype.\n\nLet's denote the allele for blue light as $A^B$ and the allele for yellow light as $A^Y$.\nThe parental generation consists of two pure-breeding (homozygous) strains.\nThe blue-light fungus has the genotype $A^B A^B$.\nThe yellow-light fungus has the genotype $A^Y A^Y$.\n\nWhen these two strains are crossed, all offspring in the F1 generation inherit one allele from each parent. Therefore, the genotype of all F1 offspring is heterozygous: $A^B A^Y$.\n\nThe problem states that these heterozygous F1 offspring exhibit a pale green phenotype, which is described as an intermediate between the parental deep blue and bright yellow phenotypes. We can now evaluate the given options based on this outcome.\n\nA. **Complete Dominance**: In a complete dominance scenario, one allele (the dominant one) would completely mask the effect of the other allele (the recessive one). If the blue allele were dominant, the F1 offspring ($A^B A^Y$) would all be deep blue. If the yellow allele were dominant, they would all be bright yellow. Since the F1 phenotype is a new, intermediate one (green), complete dominance is incorrect.\n\nB. **Pleiotropy**: This occurs when a single gene influences multiple, often unrelated, phenotypic traits. The problem describes a single gene affecting only one trait: the color of bioluminescence. There is no information to suggest that this gene affects any other characteristic of the fungus. Therefore, pleiotropy is not the correct explanation.\n\nC. **Incomplete Dominance**: This pattern occurs when the heterozygous phenotype is an intermediate or a blend of the two homozygous phenotypes. In this case, the heterozygous genotype $A^B A^Y$ results in a green phenotype, which is a blend of blue and yellow. This perfectly matches the observation. The heterozygote expresses a phenotype that is quantitatively intermediate between the two parent phenotypes.\n\nD. **Codominance**: In codominance, both alleles are fully and simultaneously expressed in the heterozygote. The resulting phenotype would show both parental traits distinctly, not as a blend. For example, a codominant fungus might have patches of deep blue light and separate patches of bright yellow light. The observed phenotype is a uniform pale green, which is a blend, not a patchwork. Thus, codominance is incorrect.\n\nE. **Epistasis**: This refers to the interaction between different genes (at different loci), where one gene can mask or modify the phenotypic expression of another gene. The problem states that the light color is determined by a single gene. There is no mention of a second gene influencing the outcome. Therefore, epistasis is not the correct explanation for the described single-gene system.\n\nBased on the analysis, the F1 generation's intermediate green phenotype resulting from a cross between blue and yellow parents is the hallmark of incomplete dominance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1965007"}, {"introduction": "Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment holds true for genes on different chromosomes, but what happens when genes reside on the same chromosome? This exercise uses experimental data that deviates from expected Mendelian ratios to illustrate the principle of genetic linkage. You will analyze how the physical proximity of genes on a chromosome causes them to be inherited together, limiting the generation of new phenotypic combinations and revealing the \"geography\" of the genome. [@problem_id:1965018]", "problem": "A biologist is studying the inheritance of two traits in a species of moth: wing pattern and antenna length. The gene for wing pattern has two alleles: a dominant allele $P$ for patterned wings and a recessive allele $p$ for plain wings. The gene for antenna length also has two alleles: a dominant allele $L$ for long antennae and a recessive allele $l$ for short antennae.\n\nThe biologist performs a test cross by mating a moth that is heterozygous for both genes ($PpLl$) with a moth that is homozygous recessive for both genes ($ppll$). According to Mendel's law of independent assortment, the expected phenotypic ratio in the offspring would be 1:1:1:1 (patterned-long : patterned-short : plain-long : plain-short).\n\nHowever, after analyzing a large number of offspring, the biologist observes the following distribution of phenotypes:\n- 46% have patterned wings and long antennae.\n- 4% have patterned wings and short antennae.\n- 4% have plain wings and long antennae.\n- 46% have plain wings and short antennae.\n\nThe parental genotypes in the dihybrid cross were derived from pure-breeding lines, one with patterned wings and long antennae ($PPLL$) and the other with plain wings and short antennae ($ppll$), meaning the heterozygous parent ($PpLl$) has the alleles $P$ and $L$ on one chromosome and $p$ and $l$ on the homologous chromosome.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for why the observed phenotypic ratios deviate so significantly from the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio?\n\nA. The two genes are subject to codominance, where both dominant and recessive alleles are expressed simultaneously, altering the phenotypic ratios.\n\nB. Epistasis is occurring, where the gene for wing pattern masks the expression of the gene for antenna length, preventing independent assortment.\n\nC. The genes for wing pattern and antenna length are located very close together on the same chromosome, causing them to be inherited together more frequently than they are separated by meiotic recombination.\n\nD. A high rate of mutation from the dominant to the recessive alleles is occurring in the gametes of the heterozygous parent, leading to an overabundance of recessive phenotypes.\n\nE. Strong selective pressures in the laboratory environment favor the survival of moths with the parental combinations of traits, while moths with new combinations are less viable.", "solution": "The expected 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio in a test cross $PpLl \\times ppll$ follows from Mendel’s law of independent assortment, which presumes that the two genes assort independently, producing equal frequencies of the four gamete types from the heterozygote: $PL$, $Pl$, $pL$, and $pl$, each with probability $0.25$. The homozygous recessive tester contributes only $pl$ gametes, so the four phenotypes appear in equal proportions.\n\nThe observed offspring distribution is $0.46$ patterned-long, $0.04$ patterned-short, $0.04$ plain-long, and $0.46$ plain-short. The heterozygous parent was produced from $PPLL \\times ppll$, and hence carries $P$ with $L$ in coupling phase on one chromosome and $p$ with $l$ on the homolog (cis configuration: $PL/pl$). In such a coupling-phase dihybrid, if the two genes are linked with recombination fraction $r$, then by standard meiotic recombination principles:\n- Parental gametes $PL$ and $pl$ are produced with probabilities $\\frac{1 - r}{2}$ each.\n- Recombinant gametes $Pl$ and $pL$ are produced with probabilities $\\frac{r}{2}$ each.\n\nIn a test cross with $ppll$, the resulting phenotypes and their expected frequencies are:\n- Patterned-long ($PpLl$) from $PL \\times pl$: frequency $\\frac{1 - r}{2}$.\n- Plain-short ($ppll$) from $pl \\times pl$: frequency $\\frac{1 - r}{2}$.\n- Patterned-short ($Ppll$) from $Pl \\times pl$: frequency $\\frac{r}{2}$.\n- Plain-long ($ppLl$) from $pL \\times pl$: frequency $\\frac{r}{2}$.\n\nMatching these to the observations gives $\\frac{1 - r}{2} \\approx 0.46$ and $\\frac{r}{2} \\approx 0.04$, which are consistent with $1 - r \\approx 0.92$ and $r \\approx 0.08$. Thus, parental combinations greatly exceed recombinant combinations because crossing over between the loci is infrequent.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is that the genes for wing pattern and antenna length are tightly linked, i.e., located very close together on the same chromosome, so they are inherited together more often than they are separated by meiotic recombination. This corresponds to option C. Alternative explanations (codominance, epistasis, mutation, or selection) do not predict the symmetric excess of parental types with equal and small recombinant classes characteristic of tight linkage in a test cross.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1965018"}, {"introduction": "An organism's phenotype is a product of both its genes and its environment. This problem moves beyond purely genetic effects to explore the dynamic interplay between the two, known as a genotype-by-environment (GxE) interaction. By interpreting how the fitness of two distinct genotypes changes across different temperatures, you will grapple with the concept of a \"norm of reaction\" and understand why the \"best\" genotype is often dependent on its environmental context.

Two distinct, asexually reproducing clones, which are therefore genetically uniform and can be referred to as Genotype A and Genotype B, are selected for the study.

The ecologist measures the average daily fecundity (number of offspring produced per female per day) as a measure of fitness for each genotype in each environment.\n\nThe results are as follows:\n- In the low-temperature environment (15°C), Genotype A exhibits a higher average fecundity than Genotype B.\n- In the high-temperature environment (25°C), Genotype B exhibits a higher average fecundity than Genotype A.\n\nIf one were to plot these results on a graph with temperature on the x-axis and fecundity on the y-axis, the lines representing the response of each genotype to the environmental change (their norms of reaction) would cross each other. Based on this observation, what does the crossing of the reaction norms signify?\n\nA.
