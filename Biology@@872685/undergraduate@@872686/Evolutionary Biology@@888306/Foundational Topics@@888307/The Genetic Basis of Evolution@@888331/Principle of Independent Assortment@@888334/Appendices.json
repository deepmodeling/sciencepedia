They have determined that purple flowers (P) are dominant over white flowers (p), and a smooth stem surface (S) is dominant over a thorny stem surface (s). The genes for these two traits are located on different chromosomes and thus assort independently.\n\nA researcher has a plant that exhibits both dominant phenotypes: purple flowers and a smooth stem. To determine the exact genotype of this plant, they perform a test cross with another plant that has white flowers and a thorny stem.

The two genes assort independently (on different chromosomes). A test cross uses a homozygous recessive partner, here $ppss$, so the phenotypes of the offspring directly reflect the gametes produced by the unknown parent.\n\nLet the unknown parent be one of the listed genotypes and cross it with $ppss$:\n\n1) If the parent is $PPSS$, its only gamete is $PS$, and with $ps$ from $ppss$ all offspring are $PpSs$ (all purple, smooth). This contradicts the presence of all four phenotypic classes observed.\n\n2) If the parent is $PPSs$, its gametes are $PS$ and $Ps$ in equal frequency. With $ps$, offspring are $PpSs$ (purple, smooth) and $Ppss$ (purple, thorny) in a $1:1$ ratio.

Crossing with $ppss$ (gamete $ps$) yields the four genotypes $PpSs$, $Ppss$, $ppSs$, and $ppss$ in the ratio $1:1:1:1$, corresponding to the four phenotypes purple-smooth, purple-thorny, white-smooth, and white-thorny, each with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$.
