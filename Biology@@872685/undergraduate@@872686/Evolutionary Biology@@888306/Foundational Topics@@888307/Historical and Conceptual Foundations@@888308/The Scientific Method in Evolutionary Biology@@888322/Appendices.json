In evolutionary biology, especially in long-term experiments, a meticulously designed control group is essential to distinguish the effects of a specific selective pressure from other evolutionary forces like genetic drift or adaptation to lab conditions. This practice challenges you to design the most rigorous control for a multi-generational study, forcing you to think critically about what makes a comparison scientifically valid [@problem_id:1974534].", "problem": "A team of evolutionary biologists is investigating the long-term effects of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) on plant anatomy. Their central hypothesis is that, over many generations, a plant population exposed to elevated CO2 levels will evolve a lower stomatal density. Stomata are microscopic pores on the surface of plant leaves that are critical for gas exchange, but through which plants also lose water. A lower density might be advantageous in a CO2-rich environment.\n\nTo test this, the researchers plan a multi-generational experiment using a fast-growing plant species with a short life cycle. They will begin with a large, genetically diverse seed stock, which they term the \"ancestral population.\" The main experimental line will be grown for 50 consecutive generations inside a controlled environmental chamber where the CO2 concentration is maintained at 800 parts per million (ppm), a level projected for the near future. All other conditions, such as light, temperature, water, and nutrients, will be kept constant and optimal. After 50 generations, the biologists will measure the average stomatal density of the resulting plant population.\n\nTo properly attribute any observed changes in stomatal density to an evolutionary response specifically driven by the high CO2 levels, a carefully designed control group is essential. Which of the following experimental designs represents the most appropriate and scientifically rigorous control group for this study?\n\nA. The original ancestral population of seeds, which have been kept dormant in a seed bank under stable, cold, and dry conditions for the duration of the 50-generation experiment.\n\nB. A parallel population of a different plant species, such as a type of grass, grown for 50 generations in a separate but identical chamber maintained at the current ambient CO2 level of approximately 420 ppm.\n\nC. A parallel population of the same plant species, started from the same ancestral population, grown for 50 generations in an identical chamber, but with the CO2 level allowed to fluctuate randomly around the current ambient level of 420 ppm.\n\nD. A parallel population of the same plant species, started from the same ancestral population, grown for 50 generations in an identical chamber with all conditions matching the experimental line, except that the CO2 level is maintained at the current ambient level of 420 ppm.\n\nE. A parallel population of the same plant species, started from the same ancestral population, grown for a single generation in an identical chamber with the CO2 level maintained at the current ambient level of 420 ppm.", "solution": "Goal: Attribute any evolved change in stomatal density after 50 generations specifically to selection imposed by elevated CO2. The control must isolate CO2 as the sole causal factor by matching all other variables and evolutionary processes.\n\nPrinciple 1 (Controlled comparison): To infer causation, the control must differ from the experimental treatment in only one factor (here, CO2 concentration). All other environmental conditions must be identical.\n\nPrinciple 2 (Shared ancestry and parallel evolution): To separate selection from standing differences, both lines must start from the same ancestral population and be propagated in parallel to control for drift, inbreeding, lab adaptation, and any cumulative non-CO2 environmental effects.\n\nPrinciple 3 (Equivalent evolutionary time): Because the hypothesis concerns evolutionary change across generations, the control must experience the same number of generations under matched conditions other than CO2 to ensure that any differences reflect selection by CO2 rather than time-dependent processes.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A: Dormant ancestral seeds are not propagated for 50 generations. Differences after 50 generations could reflect laboratory adaptation, drift, and selection unrelated to CO2. This violates Principles 2 and 3.\n- B: A different species introduces confounding species-specific traits and responses, violating Principle 2.\n- C: Randomly fluctuating CO2 around ambient introduces an additional variable (variance in CO2) and does not tightly control the selective environment, violating Principle 1. It also creates a different selection regime than constant ambient CO2.\n- D: Same species, same ancestral start, identical chamber conditions, parallel propagation for 50 generations, with the only difference being CO2 at ambient rather than 800 ppm. This satisfies Principles 1, 2, and 3 and is the appropriate, rigorous control.\n- E: Only one generation at ambient CO2 cannot control for multi-generational evolutionary processes, violating Principle 3.\n\nConclusion: The most rigorous control is the parallel 50-generation line at ambient CO2 with all else identical, i.e., option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1974534"}, {"introduction": "Powerful scientific theories do more than just explain past observations; they generate precise, testable predictions about the natural world. Hamilton's rule ($rB > C$) provides a classic quantitative framework for understanding the evolution of altruism. In this exercise, you will act as a behavioral ecologist, applying this rule to predict how a ground squirrel's decision to give an alarm call should vary depending on the genetic relatedness of its audience [@problem_id:1974509].", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying altruistic behavior in a population of Belding's ground squirrels. When a squirrel spots a terrestrial predator, it can emit a loud alarm call. This call alerts other squirrels in the vicinity, allowing them to flee to safety, but it also draws the predator's attention to the caller, increasing its personal risk of predation. The biologist aims to predict the likelihood of a squirrel making an alarm call based on the principles of kin selection, as described by Hamilton's rule.\n\nHamilton's rule states that an altruistic gene will be favored by natural selection if $rB > C$, where $C$ is the fitness cost to the actor, $B$ is the sum of fitness benefits to all recipients, and $r$ is the coefficient of relatedness between the actor and a recipient.\n\nAssume we are observing a single focal female squirrel that has detected a predator. The willingness of this squirrel to make an alarm call is directly proportional to the total inclusive fitness benefit it receives, which is calculated as the sum of the benefits to each nearby individual, devalued by their relatedness to the caller ($\\sum r_i B_i$). For this model, you can assume that the fitness benefit ($B_i$) conferred upon any single squirrel that hears the call is identical. Therefore, the willingness to call simply depends on the sum of the coefficients of relatedness of the audience.\n\nThe coefficients of relatedness ($r$) for this diploid species are as follows:\n- Parent-Offspring: $r = 0.5$\n- Full Siblings: $r = 0.5$\n- Half-Siblings (sharing one parent): $r = 0.25$\n- First Cousins: $r = 0.125$\n- Unrelated individuals: $r = 0.0$\n\nBelow are four different social contexts (I-IV) describing the individuals near the focal squirrel.

An allele that has rapidly increased in frequency may be the direct target of selection, or it may simply have \"hitchhiked\" to high frequency due to its close proximity on a chromosome to a different beneficial mutation. This advanced problem asks you to think like a population geneticist and choose the study design that can most powerfully distinguish between these two scenarios by analyzing the specific patterns of genetic variation around a candidate gene [@problem_id:1974508].", "problem": "Researchers are studying a population of coastal marine copepods (*Tigriopus californicus*) that has shown a rapid and significant increase in tolerance to heavy metal pollution (specifically, cadmium) over the past 50 years. Population genomic analysis, comparing samples from before and after the major industrialization of the local harbor, reveals a non-coding Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), designated allele 'C', that has increased in frequency from less than 1% to over 85%. This SNP is located in the upstream regulatory region of a gene named *MtnP*, which is known to encode a metallothionein-like protein involved in sequestering heavy metal ions.\n\nTwo competing hypotheses have been proposed to explain the rise of allele 'C':\n\n1.  **Direct Selection Hypothesis**: Allele 'C' itself is the target of positive selection. It is part of a cis-regulatory element that enhances the transcription of the *MtnP* gene in the presence of cadmium, directly conferring a survival advantage.\n2.  **Genetic Hitchhiking Hypothesis**: The true target of selection is a different, currently unidentified, advantageous mutation elsewhere in the *MtnP* gene or a nearby gene. Allele 'C' has no functional effect on fitness but has increased in frequency simply because it was in strong Linkage Disequilibrium (LD), a non-random association of alleles at different loci, with the actual selected allele when the selective sweep began.\n\nWhich of the following proposed studies, along with its predicted outcome, provides the most powerful and direct line of evidence to distinguish between the direct selection hypothesis and the genetic hitchhiking hypothesis using data from the contemporary, high-tolerance copepod population?\n\nA. Use a quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) to measure the expression level of the *MtnP* gene in individuals with and without allele 'C' when exposed to cadmium. A finding that individuals with allele 'C' show significantly higher *MtnP* expression would strongly favor the direct selection hypothesis.\n\nB. Sequence the entire genomic region (approximately 200 kilobases) centered on the *MtnP* gene in a large sample of individuals from the population. Under the direct selection hypothesis, one would expect to find a distinct \"valley\" of extremely low nucleotide diversity ($\\pi$) and a sharp peak of long-range haplotype homozygosity, with the apex of this signature centered precisely on the location of allele 'C'.\n\nC. Calculate the Fixation Index ($F_{\\text{ST}}$) for thousands of markers across the genome by comparing the contemporary polluted-harbor population with a nearby, unpolluted reference population. Observing that the locus containing allele 'C' is one of the highest $F_{\\text{ST}}$ outliers in the entire genome would confirm the direct selection hypothesis.\n\nD. Perform laboratory crosses to create individuals that are heterozygous for allele 'C' and homozygous for the ancestral allele at this locus. A finding that the heterozygous individuals have intermediate cadmium tolerance compared to the two homozygotes would support the direct selection hypothesis due to gene dosage effects.\n\nE. Search for the presence of allele 'C' in other geographically distinct populations of *Tigriopus californicus* that are also known to tolerate high levels of heavy metals. Finding allele 'C' at high frequency in these other populations would confirm it is the direct target of selection.", "solution": "We want a study and an outcome that directly discriminate whether the focal non-coding SNP (allele C) is itself the target of selection (direct selection hypothesis) versus merely a passenger that rose due to tight linkage with a different selected mutation (genetic hitchhiking hypothesis). The key population-genetic principle is that a completed or near-completed hard selective sweep produces a characteristic reduction in nucleotide diversity and elevated long-range haplotype homozygosity centered on the actual target of selection; the spatial apex of these signatures (minimum of nucleotide diversity and maximum of extended haplotype homozygosity) aligns with the causal site, not with merely linked markers.\n\nLogical structure:\n1. Under a classic sweep on a single causal site at genomic coordinate $x^{\\ast}$ with selection coefficient $s>0$ and recombination rate $r$ per base per generation, the expected nucleotide diversity $\\pi(d)$ as a function of distance $d$ from $x^{\\ast}$ shows a pronounced trough centered at $d=0$ (the selected site), with recovery as $|d|$ increases due to recombination breaking associations during and after the sweep. Similarly, extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) or related metrics like iHS/SDS exhibit a maximal signal centered on $x^{\\ast}$ and decay with increasing $|d|$.\n2. If allele C itself is the selected mutation, then $x^{\\ast}$ coincides with the position of C, so the center (apex) of sweep signals (minimum of $\\pi$, maximum of EHH) will be precisely at C.\n3. If allele C merely hitchhiked with a different causal mutation at $x^{\\dagger}\\neq x^{\\ast}$, then despite strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) during the sweep—quantified by $D=p_{AB}-p_{A}p_{B}$ or standardized $D'$—the population-genetic sweep signatures necessarily center on $x^{\\ast}$, not on C. Therefore, when one finely maps the valley of $\\pi$ and peak of haplotype homozygosity across a sufficiently dense set of polymorphisms in the region, the apex will align with $x^{\\ast}$ and be offset from C by the physical distance $|x^{\\ast}-x_{C}|>0$.\n4. Thus, dense resequencing of the region and analysis of sweep-centeredness can distinguish between direct selection on C (apex at C) and hitchhiking (apex displaced from C).\n\nEvaluate each proposed study against this discriminative criterion:\n- A (qPCR expression differences in C carriers under cadmium): A cis-eQTL pattern where C correlates with elevated expression of MtnP is consistent with a functional effect but does not rule out an alternative causal regulatory variant in strong LD with C. LD can produce the same expression association even when C is neutral. Without isolating the SNP by manipulation (e.g., allele swap on identical backgrounds), A cannot decisively distinguish direct selection from hitchhiking.\n- B (fine-scale resequencing and sweep-centeredness on C): This directly tests whether the apex of sweep signatures (trough in $\\pi$, peak in long-range haplotype homozygosity) is centered exactly on C. Because the apex localizes to the true selected site $x^{\\ast}$, observing the apex precisely at C strongly supports C as the causal target; observing the apex elsewhere supports hitchhiking. Among the options, this is the most powerful and direct population-genetic discriminator using data from the contemporary high-tolerance population.\n- C (genome-wide $F_{\\mathrm{ST}}$ outlier status for the C locus): An $F_{\\mathrm{ST}}$ outlier implicates local adaptation in the region but cannot discriminate whether C is causal or merely linked to the causal mutation; both hypotheses predict high differentiation.\n- D (lab crosses and intermediate phenotype in heterozygotes): As stated, the description is internally inconsistent (“heterozygous for C and homozygous for the ancestral allele at this locus” cannot simultaneously hold). Even if corrected to compare C/C, C/A, and A/A, genotype–phenotype association at this locus still cannot rule out LD with a nearby causal site; recombination in limited crosses may not fully decouple markers from the causal variant, so this remains non-decisive.\n- E (survey of C in other tolerant populations): Parallel high frequency of C elsewhere could reflect convergent selection on the same mutation, but could also arise via gene flow or repeated hitchhiking on similar haplotypes; moreover, failure to find C elsewhere would not refute its causality in the focal population. Hence, it does not directly discriminate the two hypotheses for this population.\n\nTherefore, the most powerful and direct study among those listed is to resequence the region and test whether the sweep signature is centered precisely on allele C, as in option B, and the predicted outcome described there would distinguish direct selection on C from hitchhiking.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1974508"}]}
