The Hardy-Weinberg principle provides exactly that—a mathematical null model describing the allele and genotype frequencies in a population that is not evolving. By applying this principle in a hypothetical scenario involving Galapagos tortoises [@problem_id:1951381], you can practice a foundational skill: using phenotypic data to infer the underlying genetic structure of a population.", "problem": "A team of evolutionary biologists is conducting a field study on a remote, fictional island in the Galapagos archipelago. They are observing a population of endemic giant tortoises. One of the traits they are tracking is the pattern on the tortoise's carapace, which can be either uniformly colored or exhibit faint stripes. Through genetic analysis, it has been determined that this trait is controlled by a single gene with two alleles. The allele for a striped carapace is recessive, while the allele for a uniform carapace is dominant.\n\nThe team conducts a census of the entire tortoise population on the island, finding a total of 200 individuals. Among these, 18 tortoises are observed to have a striped carapace. Assuming this population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with respect to this gene, calculate the expected frequency of heterozygous tortoises in this population.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $p$ denote the frequency of the dominant allele (uniform carapace) and $q$ the frequency of the recessive allele (striped carapace). Under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, genotype frequencies are $p^2$ (homozygous dominant), $2pq$ (heterozygous), and $q^2$ (homozygous recessive). Because the striped phenotype is recessive, its frequency equals $q^2$.\n\nFrom the census, $18$ out of $200$ tortoises are striped, so\n$$\nq^2 = \\frac{18}{200} = 0.09.\n$$\nThus, the allele frequency $q$ is\n$$\nq = \\sqrt{0.09} = 0.3.\n$$\nSince allele frequencies must sum to 1,\n$$\np = 1 - q = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.\n$$\nThe expected heterozygote frequency is given by $2pq$:\n$$\n2pq = 2 \\times 0.7 \\times 0.3 = 0.42.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $0.420$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.420}$$", "id": "1951381"}, {"introduction": "Natural selection is a powerful engine of evolution, but its effects are not arbitrary; they can be quantified and predicted. The breeder's equation, $R = h^2S$, is a cornerstone of quantitative genetics that connects the strength of selection ($S$) on a trait and its heritability ($h^2$) to the evolutionary response ($R$) in the next generation.

Their primary food source was a low-growing species of prickly pear cactus. A sudden and severe fungal blight completely eradicated this cactus species. The only remaining plant-based food source for the tortoises is a taller, native cactus species, *Opuntia altacolla*, whose lowest edible pads grow at a significant height. This shift has imposed a strong selective pressure on the tortoise population, favoring individuals with longer necks who can reach the new food source.\n\nA team of evolutionary biologists had been monitoring this population. Their data from just before the blight showed that the mean neck length for the entire adult tortoise population was 25.0 cm. Following the ecological shift, the biologists observed that only a subset of the original population could successfully reach the *Opuntia altacolla* pads to feed and reproduce. The mean neck length of these successfully reproducing tortoises was measured to be 28.5 cm. Prior genetic analysis of this specific tortoise population has robustly established the narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$) for the neck length trait to be 0.75.\n\nBased on this data, predict the mean neck length of the first offspring generation born after this selection event.
