One of his most famous discoveries was a sharp boundary, now known as the Wallace Line, separating the distinct fauna of Asia and Australia. This practice problem allows you to quantify this biogeographical break using the Jaccard Similarity Index, a standard tool in modern ecology, thereby connecting Wallace's historical observations to rigorous, data-driven analysis [@problem_id:1907307].", "problem": "In the mid-19th century, naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace observed a stark division in the faunal compositions of islands in the Malay Archipelago. This boundary, now known as the Wallace Line, separates the biogeographic realms of Asia (the Sunda Shelf) and Australia (the Sahul Shelf). To quantitatively assess such biogeographic discontinuities, ecologists often use similarity indices.\n\nAn ecologist has compiled lists of terrestrial vertebrate genera from two hypothetical islands, Pulau Barat (\"West Island\") and Pulau Timur (\"East Island\"), situated on opposite sides of the Wallace Line. Your task is to calculate the faunal similarity between them.\n\nThe faunal list for Pulau Barat, representing the Sunda realm, is:\n*Macaca*, *Panthera*, *Viverra*, *Sus*, *Tragulus*, *Galeopterus*, *Helarctos*, *Manis*, *Tupaia*, *Petaurista*, *Rattus*, *Cynopterus*\n\nThe faunal list for Pulau Timur, representing the Sahul realm, is:\n*Dendrolagus*, *Phalanger*, *Dasyurus*, *Perameles*, *Zaglossus*, *Cacatua*, *Varanus*, *Morelia*, *Litoria*, *Thylogale*, *Pteropus*, *Rattus*, *Cynopterus*\n\nTo measure the similarity, you will use the Jaccard Similarity Index ($J_s$). For two sets, $A$ and $B$, the Jaccard index is defined as the size of the intersection of the sets divided by the size of their union. The formula is:\n$$J_s = \\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|A \\cup B|}$$\nCalculate the Jaccard Similarity Index for the two faunal lists. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $A$ be the set of genera from Pulau Barat and $B$ be the set of genera from Pulau Timur. By counting the listed genera, $|A|=12$ and $|B|=13$.\n\nThe shared genera between the two islands are Rattus and Cynopterus, so $|A \\cap B|=2$. Using the set identity $|A \\cup B|=|A|+|B|-|A \\cap B|$, we obtain\n$$\n|A \\cup B|=12+13-2=23.\n$$\n\nThe Jaccard Similarity Index is defined as\n$$\nJ_{s}=\\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|A \\cup B|}=\\frac{2}{23}.\n$$\nConverting to a decimal and rounding to three significant figures yields\n$$\nJ_{s}\\approx 0.0870.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0870}$$", "id": "1907307"}, {"introduction": "From his observations of geographical variation, Wallace formulated a powerful mechanism for evolutionary change, which he titled 'On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type.' This phrase encapsulates the core of speciation by natural selection. This exercise challenges you to translate Wallace's 19th-century articulation of this process into the precise language of modern population genetics, a crucial skill for understanding how foundational concepts in science are refined and formalized over time [@problem_id:1907327].", "problem": "In 1858, the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace sent a manuscript to Charles Darwin outlining a theory of evolution remarkably similar to Darwin's own. The title of Wallace's essay was \"On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type.\" This phrase captures the essence of evolution by natural selection, describing how new species can arise from existing ones.\n\nUsing the modern vocabulary of population genetics, which of the following statements most accurately and completely rephrases the process described by Wallace's title?\n\nA. In the absence of gene flow, populations under divergent selective pressures will experience directional changes in their allele frequencies. Over time, this can lead to the accumulation of genetic differences sufficient to cause reproductive isolation.\n\nB. In small, isolated populations, random, non-adaptive fluctuations in allele frequencies, a process known as genetic drift, will inevitably cause the population's genetic makeup to diverge from its ancestral state.\n\nC. The continuous introduction of new alleles through mutation is the primary force that causes a population's average phenotype to depart from its original form, as it provides a constant source of novelty.\n\nD. Natural selection primarily acts through stabilizing selection to remove extreme phenotypes, ensuring that a variety remains well-adapted and does not depart significantly from its optimal, original type.\n\nE. Gene flow between neighboring populations ensures that advantageous traits are shared, causing all connected varieties to evolve in unison and gradually depart from their more primitive, shared ancestral type.", "solution": "Wallace's phrasing \"tendency of varieties to depart indefinitely from the original type\" describes adaptive divergence driven by natural selection, where different environments impose different selective pressures, causing directional changes in allele frequencies that, in the continued absence of homogenizing forces like gene flow, can accumulate to the point of reproductive isolation (speciation). Using population genetics terms, the mechanism centers on natural selection changing allele frequencies in different directions in different populations, with reduced gene flow allowing divergence to persist and accumulate until isolation emerges.\n\nEvaluate each option against this framework:\n- Option A specifies the absence of gene flow, divergent selective pressures, directional changes in allele frequencies due to selection, and eventual reproductive isolation through accumulated genetic differences. This precisely rephrases adaptive divergence and speciation as envisioned by Wallace.\n- Option B emphasizes genetic drift in small populations as an inevitable driver of divergence. Drift is stochastic, not necessarily causing adaptive, indefinite departure, and was not Wallace’s mechanism; it also misuses \"inevitably\" in the adaptive sense.\n- Option C elevates mutation as the primary force causing departure. Mutation supplies variation, but selection is the primary driver of adaptive shifts; this misstates causality central to Wallace’s idea.\n- Option D describes stabilizing selection that prevents departure, the opposite of Wallace’s \"depart indefinitely.\"\n- Option E invokes gene flow causing unison evolution; gene flow homogenizes and counteracts divergence, conflicting with the mechanism of divergence leading to speciation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete rephrasing is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1907327"}, {"introduction": "A hallmark of a robust scientific theory is its ability to generate testable predictions, and Wallace's work on warning coloration and mimicry provided some of the most compelling early evidence for natural selection. This exercise places you in the role of a modern field ecologist interpreting an experiment to distinguish between Batesian and Müllerian mimicry. By analyzing the hypothetical data, you will engage in the process of scientific reasoning that allows us to test evolutionary hypotheses directly, demonstrating how Wallace's foundational ideas continue to drive active research today [@problem_id:1907279].", "problem": "Inspired by the pioneering fieldwork of Alfred Russel Wallace in the Malay Archipelago, a modern ecologist designs an experiment to investigate the relationship between two co-occurring, conspicuously colored butterfly species. Species T (*Toxicus wallacei*) is known to be unpalatable to local avian predators due to sequestered toxins. Species S (*Simulans alfredi*) bears a striking resemblance to Species T, but its own palatability is unknown.\n\nThe ecologist's goal is to determine if Species S is a Batesian mimic (a palatable species mimicking an unpalatable one) or if it is part of a Müllerian mimicry complex (where both species are unpalatable and share a warning signal).\n\nTo test this, the ecologist creates realistic, edible models of Species S and also of a third, local butterfly, Species C (*Controlus communis*). Species C is known to be palatable and has a cryptic, non-mimetic coloration. The experiment is conducted in two large, geographically separate forest reserves:\n- **Location 1**: A reserve where the unpalatable model, Species T, is naturally abundant.\n- **Location 2**: A reserve, with a similar avian predator community, but where Species T is naturally absent.\n\nIn each location, 400 models of Species S and 400 models of the palatable control, Species C, are placed in the environment. After a set period, the models are collected, and the number showing clear evidence of avian predation attempts (e.g., beak marks) is recorded. The results are as follows:\n\n- **In Location 1 (with Species T present):**\n  - Models of Species S: 24 predation attempts.\n  - Models of Species C: 168 predation attempts.\n\n- **In Location 2 (without Species T present):**\n  - Models of Species S: 162 predation attempts.\n  - Models of Species C: 172 predation attempts.\n\nBased on these experimental results, what is the most likely evolutionary relationship between Species S and Species T?\n\nA. Species S is a Batesian mimic of Species T.\n\nB. Species S and Species T form a Müllerian mimicry complex.\n\nC. Species S is also unpalatable and is aposematically colored, but it is not mimicking Species T.\n\nD. Species S is a predator of Species T, engaging in aggressive mimicry.\n\nE. The data are inconclusive as the predation pressure on the real Species T was not measured.", "solution": "We define the ecologist’s test as measuring attack probabilities on edible models, which reflect avian predators’ learned avoidance of unpalatability and visual signals. Let $p_{S,1}$ and $p_{C,1}$ denote the predation probabilities on Species S and Species C in Location 1 (with Species T present), and $p_{S,2}$ and $p_{C,2}$ the corresponding probabilities in Location 2 (without Species T).\n\nCompute the observed attack probabilities:\n- In Location 1: $p_{S,1} = \\frac{24}{400} = \\frac{3}{50} = 0.06$, and $p_{C,1} = \\frac{168}{400} = \\frac{21}{50} = 0.42$.\n- In Location 2: $p_{S,2} = \\frac{162}{400} = \\frac{81}{200} = 0.405$, and $p_{C,2} = \\frac{172}{400} = \\frac{43}{100} = 0.43$.\n\nState the key evolutionary hypotheses and their predictions:\n- Batesian mimicry (Species S palatable mimicking unpalatable Species T): \n  - Prediction 1: When Species T is present, predators generalize avoidance, so $p_{S,1} \\ll p_{C,1}$.\n  - Prediction 2: When Species T is absent, no avoidance is learned from the model, so $p_{S,2} \\approx p_{C,2}$ (both high, as both are palatable-looking/edible).\n- Müllerian mimicry (both S and T unpalatable sharing a warning signal):\n  - Prediction 1: When Species T is present, $p_{S,1} \\ll p_{C,1}$ due to shared warning.\n  - Prediction 2: Even when Species T is absent, if S itself is unpalatable, predators should learn to avoid S from direct encounters, leading to $p_{S,2} \\ll p_{C,2}$ and a generally low $p_{S,2}$.\n\nCompare observations with predictions:\n- In Location 1 (with T present): $p_{S,1} = 0.06$ is far lower than $p_{C,1} = 0.42$, matching both Batesian and Müllerian predictions of protection via the warning signal.\n- In Location 2 (without T): $p_{S,2} = 0.405$ is approximately equal to $p_{C,2} = 0.43$, indicating S is attacked at nearly the same high rate as the known palatable control. This matches the Batesian prediction ($p_{S,2} \\approx p_{C,2}$), and contradicts the Müllerian prediction ($p_{S,2}$ should remain low if S were unpalatable).\n\nThus, the context dependence—strong protection only where T is present and loss of protection where T is absent—indicates that S is palatable and benefits from the presence of the unpalatable model T through predator generalization. Therefore, Species S is a Batesian mimic of Species T.\n\nEliminate alternatives:\n- B is inconsistent with the high $p_{S,2}$ in the absence of T.\n- C is inconsistent with S’s high attack rate in Location 2 relative to a palatable control.\n- D is irrelevant to the observed avian predation patterns on edible models.\n- E is incorrect because the experimental design directly tests predator responses to S under varying presence of the model T; the contrast across locations is decisive without measuring attacks on real T.\n\nTherefore, the most likely relationship is Batesian mimicry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1907279"}]}
