An outgroup species, *Progenotrix antiqua*, is used to root the phylogenetic tree. The biologist has coded five discrete morphological and metabolic characters, with '0' representing the ancestral state (as seen in the outgroup) and '1' representing the derived state.\n\nThe character data matrix is as follows:\n- *Progenotrix antiqua* (Outgroup): 00000\n- Taxon A: 10001\n- Taxon B: 11000\n- Taxon C: 11101\n- Taxon D: 11110\n\nThe biologist proposes a phylogenetic hypothesis represented by the following cladogram structure: Taxa C and D form a clade (a monophyletic group). This (C,D) clade is the sister group to Taxon B. Finally, the clade containing B, C, and D is the sister group to Taxon A.\n\nBased on the principle of parsimony, one of these five characters is an autapomorphy for one of the taxa on the proposed cladogram.

Thus the ingroup topology is $(((C,D),B),A)$ with the outgroup rooting outside the ingroup. The outgroup is coded $00000$, so the ancestral state for each character is $0$. Under parsimony, each character contributes a number of steps equal to the minimum number of state changes required on this tree. An autapomorphy is a derived state $1$ unique to a single terminal taxon, contributing a single change on that terminal branch and no information about relationships.\n\nEvaluate each character against the topology:\n\n- Character 1: A, B, C, D are all $1$, outgroup $0$. This is a single $0 \\to 1$ change on the branch leading to the ingroup, a synapomorphy for the ingroup, not an autapomorphy. Steps = $1$.\n\n- Character 2: States are A $0$, B $1$, C $1$, D $1$. This is a single $0 \\to 1$ on the branch subtending the clade $(B,(C,D))$, a synapomorphy for B, C, and D. Steps = $1$.\n\n- Character 3: States are A $0$, B $0$, C $1$, D $1$.
