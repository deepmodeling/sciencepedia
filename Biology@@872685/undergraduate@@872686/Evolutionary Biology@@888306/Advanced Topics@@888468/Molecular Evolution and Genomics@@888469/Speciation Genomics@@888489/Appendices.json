This principle allows us to use genetic divergence as a yardstick to estimate the time since species last shared a common ancestor.

The genetic architecture of the traits under selection—whether they are controlled by a few major genes or many genes of small effect—profoundly shapes this genomic landscape. This final problem challenges you to predict the genome-wide pattern of differentiation that arises when speciation is driven by selection on a complex, polygenic trait in the face of ongoing gene flow [@problem_id:1965509].", "problem": "Two populations of a species of wildflower are in the process of speciation. One population grows at a high elevation where a short growing season favors early flowering, while the other population grows in a lower valley where a longer season favors later flowering to maximize growth before reproduction. This difference in flowering time is beginning to cause reproductive isolation. Assume that flowering time is a complex, polygenic trait, meaning it is controlled by a large number of genes, each contributing a small effect to the phenotype. There is still a low but consistent rate of gene flow between the high-elevation and valley populations due to pollen dispersal by wind.\n\nA team of researchers samples individuals from both populations and sequences their entire genomes. They then analyze the pattern of genetic differentiation across the genome by calculating the fixation index ($F_{ST}$) in sliding windows. Which of the following patterns of genomic differentiation is the most likely outcome of this scenario?\n\nA. Many small regions of moderate differentiation scattered across multiple chromosomes, corresponding to the many small-effect loci under selection.\n\nB.

Uniformly low differentiation across the entire genome, with no discernible peaks of differentiation.\n\nE. One or two distinct peaks of extremely high differentiation, each restricted to a single chromosome where major flowering-time genes are clustered.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the genomic signature of divergence between two plant populations where speciation is being driven by selection on a polygenic trait (flowering time) in the presence of gene flow.\n\nStep 1: Understand the forces at play.\nThere are two main evolutionary forces acting on the genomes of these populations:\n1.  **Divergent Selection:** The differing environmental conditions (high elevation vs. valley) impose opposing selective pressures on the trait of flowering time. This force promotes genetic differentiation between the populations, particularly at genes that influence this trait.\n2.  **Gene Flow:** The dispersal of pollen between populations acts as a homogenizing force. It mixes alleles between the populations, counteracting differentiation and preventing the genomes from diverging uniformly.\n\nStep 2: Consider the interaction between gene flow and selection.\nIn a \"speciation-with-gene-flow\" scenario, the genome becomes a mosaic of differentiated and undifferentiated regions. Gene flow effectively swamps out random genetic drift, keeping most of the genome similar between the two populations (low differentiation). However, in genomic regions that are under strong divergent selection, selection can overpower the homogenizing effect of gene flow. This allows alleles favored in one environment to increase in frequency there, despite the influx of different alleles from the other population. This process creates \"islands of differentiation\" in a \"sea of genomic homogeneity.\" The differentiation statistic, $F_{ST}$, will be low across most of the genome but will show peaks at these selected regions.\n\nStep 3: Factor in the genetic architecture of the trait.\nThe problem crucially states that flowering time is a **polygenic trait**. This means that the phenotype is not determined by one or two major genes, but rather by the cumulative small effects of many genes (loci) spread throughout the genome.\n\nStep 4: Predict the genomic pattern.\nSince divergent selection is acting on the polygenic trait of flowering time, it is simultaneously targeting all of the numerous loci that contribute to it. Each of these loci will be a small \"island\" where selection resists the homogenizing effect of gene flow. Because the loci controlling a polygenic trait are often scattered across different chromosomes, we would expect to see many peaks of differentiation distributed throughout the genome, not concentrated in one or two large blocks.\n\nFurthermore, because each locus has only a **small effect** on the overall phenotype, the strength of selection acting on any single locus is relatively weak. Strong selection leads to very high $F_{ST}$ peaks. Weaker selection (relative to gene flow) will lead to more moderate $F_{ST}$ peaks. Therefore, we expect to see many peaks, but each peak might only represent moderate, not extreme, differentiation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options.\n-   **A. Many small regions of moderate differentiation scattered across multiple chromosomes, corresponding to the many small-effect loci under selection.** This matches our prediction perfectly. The polygenic nature of the trait leads to many targets for selection, and the small effect of each locus leads to moderate differentiation at each peak.\n-   **B. A small number of very large genomic regions showing extremely high differentiation (often called \"speciation islands\").** This pattern is expected when speciation is driven by one or a few genes of major effect, or by large chromosomal rearrangements (like an inversion) that suppress recombination over a large area. It is not the expected pattern for a classic polygenic trait with many unlinked, small-effect loci.\n-   **C. Uniformly high differentiation across the entire genome.** This would only occur in the complete absence of gene flow (allopatric speciation) over a long period, where the entire genomes diverge due to both selection and drift. The stated presence of gene flow makes this outcome incorrect.\n-   **D. Uniformly low differentiation across the entire genome.** This would occur if gene flow is much stronger than selection, preventing any significant divergence. This would mean speciation is not effectively proceeding, which contradicts the premise of the problem.\n-   **E. One or two distinct peaks of extremely high differentiation, each restricted to a single chromosome where major flowering-time genes are clustered.** This is a more specific version of option B. While it's possible for quantitative trait loci to cluster, the general expectation for a polygenic trait is that the causal loci are scattered. This is not the most likely general outcome.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the most plausible scenario is a \"polygenic architecture of speciation\" resulting in many small peaks of moderate differentiation across the genome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1965509"}]}
