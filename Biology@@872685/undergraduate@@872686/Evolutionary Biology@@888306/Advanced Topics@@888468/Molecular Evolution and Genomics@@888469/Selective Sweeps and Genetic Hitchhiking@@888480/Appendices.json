A selective sweep can be a remarkably rapid process, and we can model its dynamics mathematically to get a tangible feel for the timescale involved. This first exercise allows you to apply the fundamental logistic growth equation of population genetics to calculate how many generations it takes for a highly advantageous allele, like one conferring antibiotic resistance, to spread from being very rare to nearly universal in a population. [@problem_id:1962115]", "problem": "In a large, sexually reproducing population, a new beneficial allele arises. The spread of this advantageous allele through the population due to positive selection is known as a selective sweep. The change in the frequency, $p$, of this beneficial allele over time in generations, $t$, can be modeled by the logistic differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dt} = sp(1-p) $$\nwhere $s$ is the selection coefficient, a measure of the fitness advantage of the allele.\n\nConsider a bacterial population where a mutation confers resistance to a newly introduced antibiotic. This resistance allele has a selection coefficient of $s = 0.045$. Calculate the number of generations it takes for the frequency of this resistance allele to increase from an initial frequency of $p_0 = 0.005$ to a frequency of $p_f = 0.995$.\n\nExpress your answer for the number of generations as a real number, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the time $T$ it takes for an allele frequency $p$ to change from an initial value $p_0$ to a final value $p_f$, governed by the differential equation $\\frac{dp}{dt} = sp(1-p)$.\n\nFirst, we must solve this differential equation to find an expression for the time $T$. We can do this by separating the variables $p$ and $t$.\n$$ \\frac{dp}{p(1-p)} = s \\, dt $$\nTo find the total time $T$ required for the frequency to change from $p_0$ to $p_f$, we integrate both sides of the equation over the corresponding intervals.
