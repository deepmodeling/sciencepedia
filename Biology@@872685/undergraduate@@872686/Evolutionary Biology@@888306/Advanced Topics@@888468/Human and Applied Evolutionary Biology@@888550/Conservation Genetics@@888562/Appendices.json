Conservation genetics uses the concept of effective population size, $N_e$, to quantify the rate of genetic drift a population actually experiences. This first exercise demonstrates how a skewed sex ratio, a common issue in small or managed populations, can cause the effective population size to be dramatically lower than the census size, accelerating the loss of genetic diversity [@problem_id:1479190].", "problem": "A conservation team has established a captive breeding program for the critically endangered Gilded Sun-wing Butterfly, a species recently decimated by a fungal pathogen. The founding population of this program consists of 45 breeding adults. Genetic screening reveals that this group is composed of only 5 sexually mature males, with the remainder being sexually mature females.\n\nThe effective population size ($N_e$) is a crucial metric in conservation genetics, representing the size of a theoretical, idealized population that would experience the same amount of random genetic drift as the actual population under study. Given the unequal sex ratio in the Gilded Sun-wing Butterfly breeding program, calculate the effective population size ($N_e$) for this founding group.

Since the total population consists of only males and females, we can find $N_f$ by subtracting the number of males from the total population:\n$N_f = N_{total} - N_m$\n$N_f = 45 - 5 = 40$\nSo, there are 40 breeding females.\n\nThe formula for calculating the effective population size ($N_e$) when there is an unequal sex ratio of breeding individuals is:\n$$N_e = \\frac{4 N_m N_f}{N_m + N_f}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the values of $N_m$ and $N_f$ into this formula:\n$N_m = 5$\n$N_f = 40$\n\n$$N_e = \\frac{4 \\times 5 \\times 40}{5 + 40}$$\n\nWe perform the arithmetic in the numerator and the denominator:\nNumerator: $4 \\times 5 \\times 40 = 20 \\times 40 = 800$\nDenominator: $5 + 40 = 45$\n\nSo, the expression for $N_e$ becomes:\n$$N_e = \\frac{800}{45}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$N_e = 17.777...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are 1, 7, and 7. The fourth digit is 7, which is 5 or greater, so we round up the third significant figure.\n$$N_e \\approx 17.8$$\n\nThus, the effective population size of the founding colony is approximately 17.8.

These bottlenecks have a disproportionately large and lasting impact on a population's genetic diversity.

This species is particularly sensitive to climatic fluctuations. Field data collected over several decades reveal a consistent cyclical pattern in the population's size, driven by a recurring four-year weather cycle. For three consecutive years of the cycle, environmental conditions are favorable, and the census population size is stable at 500 individuals. However, the fourth year of the cycle is marked by an unusually warm and dry summer, leading to a severe population crash where the census size drops to just 20 individuals. This four-year cycle is observed to repeat consistently.\n\nFor the purpose of modeling the long-term genetic health of this population, assume that one generation corresponds to one year and that the census size in any given year is equal to the effective population size for that single generation.\n\nCalculate the long-term effective population size ($N_e$) for this pika population over one full cycle.

By working through this problem, you will learn how to quantify the \"resistance\" of different habitat types to gene flow, providing critical insights for designing effective wildlife corridors and conservation areas [@problem_id:1479191].", "problem": "A conservation biologist is studying a reclusive species of salamander that inhabits a set of four isolated ponds, designated A, B, C, and O. Pond O is centrally located and serves as a hub, connecting to the three peripheral ponds A, B, and C via distinct, linear corridors. Each corridor is composed of a single, uniform habitat type.\n\n- The corridor from pond O to pond A has a length $L_A = 2.0$ km and consists entirely of pristine forest (Habitat 1).\n- The corridor from pond O to pond B has a length $L_B = 3.0$ km and consists entirely of agricultural pasture (Habitat 2).\n- The corridor from pond O to pond C has a length $L_C = 4.0$ km and consists entirely of managed pine plantation (Habitat 3).\n\nThe biologist's working hypothesis is that any salamander migration between the peripheral ponds (A, B, and C) must occur by passing through the central pond O. The genetic differentiation between any two populations is modeled using the principle of Isolation by Resistance (IBR). In this model, the linearized Fixation Index ($F_{ST}$), which is a measure of population differentiation, is defined as $G_{ij} = \\frac{F_{ST, ij}}{1 - F_{ST, ij}}$. The model posits a direct proportionality between this value and the effective resistance distance, $D_{\\text{eff}, ij}$, between any two ponds $i$ and $j$, such that $G_{ij} = k \\cdot D_{\\text{eff}, ij}$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality. The effective resistance distance is calculated by summing the products of corridor length and the habitat's specific resistance value for all segments along the path connecting the two ponds.\n\nBy convention, the resistance of the most permeable habitat, the pristine forest, is normalized to one. Therefore, the resistance for Habitat 1 is $R_1=1$.
