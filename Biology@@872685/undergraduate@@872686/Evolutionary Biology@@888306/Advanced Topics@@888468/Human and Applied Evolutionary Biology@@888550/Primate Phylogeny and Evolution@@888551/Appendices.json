By aligning these intron sequences, they find that the sequences differ by 4.8%. Assuming a constant rate of evolution, calculate the underlying mutation rate. Express your answer in units of substitutions per site per year, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the mutation rate ($\\mu$) given the divergence time and sequence divergence between two species. This can be calculated using the principles of the molecular clock.\n\nThe core relationship is that the sequence divergence ($D$) between two lineages is proportional to the mutation rate ($\\mu$) and the total time elapsed since they diverged. The time since the last common ancestor is given as $T$. When two species diverge from a common ancestor, mutations accumulate independently in each lineage. Therefore, the total time for divergence to occur is the sum of the time along both branches of the evolutionary tree, which is $2T$.\n\nThe formula relating these quantities is:\n$$D = 2 \\mu T$$\n\nHere, we are given:\n- Sequence divergence, $D = 4.8\\%$. This must be converted to a decimal fraction, so $D = 0.048$ substitutions per site.\n- Time since divergence, $T = 25$ million years, which is $T = 25 \\times 10^{6}$ years.\n\nWe need to solve for the mutation rate, $\\mu$. Rearranging the formula:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{D}{2T}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into the equation:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{0.048}{2 \\times (25 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ years})}$$\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n$$2T = 2 \\times 25 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ years} = 50 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ years} = 5.0 \\times 10^{7} \\text{ years}$$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for $\\mu$:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{0.048}{5.0 \\times 10^{7} \\text{ years}}$$\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can write 0.048 in scientific notation as $4.8 \\times 10^{-2}$:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{4.8 \\times 10^{-2}}{5.0 \\times 10^{7}} \\text{ substitutions/site/year}$$\n\n$$\\mu = \\frac{4.8}{5.0} \\times \\frac{10^{-2}}{10^{7}} \\text{ substitutions/site/year}$$\n\n$$\\mu = 0.96 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ substitutions/site/year}$$\n\nTo express this in standard scientific notation (where the leading digit is between 1 and 10), we can write:\n$$\\mu = 9.6 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ substitutions/site/year}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures.

This evidence is crucial for testing hypotheses about the mode of speciation, such as whether a new species arose through a gradual transformation (anagenesis) or a branching event (cladogenesis). In this problem [@problem_id:1957038], you will use the overlapping fossil ranges of early hominins to evaluate which of these evolutionary patterns is better supported.", "problem": "In paleoanthropology, two primary models are used to describe the tempo and mode of speciation. The first model, **anagenesis** (or phyletic gradualism), proposes that a species gradually transforms into a new species over time, such that the ancestral species as a whole is replaced by the descendant species. This process suggests a linear, non-branching evolutionary lineage. The second model, **cladogenesis**, describes the splitting of an ancestral species into two or more descendant species, leading to a branching pattern of evolution where the ancestral species may coexist for a time with the new descendant species before potentially going extinct.\n\nConsider the following fossil data for two hominin species:\n- ***Homo habilis***: Fossils are found in geological strata dated from 2.1 million years ago (mya) to 1.5 mya.\n- ***Homo erectus***: Fossils are found in geological strata dated from 1.9 mya to 0.1 mya.\n\nAssuming these fossil ranges are an accurate representation of the species' existence in time, which of the following statements provides the most accurate interpretation of this evidence?\n\nA. Cladogenesis is supported, as the overlapping time ranges suggest that the ancestral species (*Homo habilis*) coexisted with the descendant species (*Homo erectus*) rather than transforming directly into it.\n\nB. Anagenesis is supported, as the fossil record shows *Homo habilis* being replaced by the more recent *Homo erectus*, indicating a clear temporal sequence of replacement.\n\nC. Anagenesis is supported, because *Homo erectus* appears later in time than *Homo habilis*, which is the defining feature of a direct evolutionary progression.\n\nD. Cladogenesis is supported, because the existence of two distinct species with different names (*habilis* and *erectus*) inherently implies a branching event must have occurred.", "solution": "Define time in millions of years ago (mya) as a one-dimensional axis.

Given the assumption that fossil ranges accurately represent existence, this implies no temporal coexistence; formally, strict anagenesis predicts\n$$\nT_{\\text{ancestor}} \\cap T_{\\text{descendant}} = \\varnothing.\n$$\n- Under cladogenesis (branching), a descendant species splits off while the ancestral species may persist for some time, allowing temporal coexistence; thus cladogenesis is consistent with\n$$\nT_{\\text{ancestor}} \\cap T_{\\text{descendant}} \\neq \\varnothing.\n$$\n\nApplying these expectations to the observed intervals:\n- Since $T_{\\text{habilis}} \\cap T_{\\text{erectus}} = [1.9, 1.5] \\neq \\varnothing$, the data contradict strict anagenesis (which would require no overlap) and are consistent with cladogenesis (which allows overlap).\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A aligns with the observed overlap and the cladogenesis expectation; it correctly interprets coexistence as support for cladogenesis.\n- Option B incorrectly claims anagenesis is supported; the overlap contradicts the no-overlap condition expected under strict anagenesis given accurate fossil ranges.\n- Option C falsely identifies mere later appearance as sufficient for anagenesis; cladogenesis also produces later-appearing descendants, so later appearance alone is not diagnostic, especially in the presence of overlap.\n- Option D incorrectly asserts that different species names inherently imply branching; anagenetic sequences can also involve distinct species designations without necessarily implying a branching event.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate interpretation is cladogenesis based on the overlapping ranges.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1957038"}, {"introduction": "The evolution of key adaptations, like hominin bipedalism, can be understood as the result of ecological pressures and energetic trade-offs.
