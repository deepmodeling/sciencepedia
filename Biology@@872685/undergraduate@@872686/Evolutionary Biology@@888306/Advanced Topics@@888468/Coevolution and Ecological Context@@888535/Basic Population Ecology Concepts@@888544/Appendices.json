Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem describes a population undergoing exponential growth. The standard mathematical model for exponential growth is given by the equation:\n$$N(t) = N_0 \\exp(rt)$$\nwhere $N(t)$ is the population size (or biomass) at time $t$, $N_0$ is the initial population size at $t=0$, $r$ is the intrinsic rate of increase, and $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nThe problem states that the population's doubling time, which we will denote as $t_d$, is 18 months. The doubling time is the time required for the population to become twice its initial size. Therefore, at $t = t_d$, the population size is $N(t_d) = 2N_0$.\n\nWe can substitute this condition into the exponential growth equation:\n$$2N_0 = N_0 \\exp(r t_d)$$\n\nTo solve for the intrinsic rate of increase $r$, we first simplify the equation by dividing both sides by the initial population size $N_0$, which is non-zero:\n$$2 = \\exp(r t_d)$$\n\nNext, we need to isolate $r$. We can do this by taking the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides of the equation:\n$$\\ln(2) = \\ln(\\exp(r t_d))$$\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that $\\ln(\\exp(x)) = x$, the right side of the equation simplifies to:\n$$\\ln(2) = r t_d$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $r$ by dividing by the doubling time $t_d$:\n$$r = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_d}$$\n\nThe problem provides the value of the doubling time as $t_d = 18$ months. We can now substitute this value into our derived formula for $r$:\n$$r = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{18 \\text{ months}}$$\n\nUsing the approximate value for the natural logarithm of 2, $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147...$, we can calculate the numerical value for $r$:\n$$r \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{18} \\text{ months}^{-1}$$\n$$r \\approx 0.03850817... \\text{ months}^{-1}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
