The interaction is governed by a simple gene-for-gene model involving a single locus in each species.\n\nIn the host plant, a single locus with two alleles determines resistance. The allele $R$ is dominant and codes for a receptor protein, while the allele $r$ is recessive and does not produce a functional receptor.\n\nIn the parasite fungus, a single locus with two alleles determines its ability to be detected. The allele $A$ is dominant and codes for an avirulence signal protein, while the allele $a$ is recessive and does not produce this signal protein.\n\nA successful host defense (i.e., resistance) occurs if and only if a host plant possesses at least one $R$ allele to produce the receptor, and the infecting fungus possesses at least one $A$ allele to produce the corresponding signal. All other combinations of host and parasite genotypes result in a successful infection.\n\nField surveys indicate that both populations are large, diploid, and can be modeled as being in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. The frequency of the resistance allele $R$ in the host population is 0.75. The frequency of the avirulence allele $A$ in the parasite population is 0.40.\n\nAssuming that any host is equally likely to be encountered by any parasite, calculate the overall proportion of random encounters that will result in a successful infection for the parasite. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the overall proportion of encounters that result in a successful infection. A successful infection occurs in any scenario except for the specific case of resistance. Therefore, it is easier to first calculate the probability of resistance, `P(Resistance)`, and then find the probability of infection, `P(Infection)`, using the relationship `P(Infection) = 1 - P(Resistance)`.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, resistance occurs if and only if the host has a resistant genotype (at least one $R$ allele) AND the parasite has an avirulent genotype (at least one $A$ allele). Since the encounters are random, the probabilities of the host and parasite genotypes are independent.\nTherefore, `P(Resistance) = P(Host is resistant) \\times P(Parasite is avirulent)`.\n\nLet's calculate each of these probabilities.\n\nFirst, consider the host population.\nLet $p_H$ be the frequency of the $R$ allele and $q_H$ be the frequency of the $r$ allele.\nWe are given $p_H = f(R) = 0.75$.\nSince there are only two alleles, $q_H = f(r) = 1 - p_H = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$.\n\nThe host is resistant if its genotype is $RR$ or $Rr$. The host is susceptible only if its genotype is $rr$. Since the population is in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), we can calculate the frequency of the susceptible genotype $rr$ as $f(rr) = q_H^2$.\nThe probability that a randomly chosen host is resistant, `P(Host is resistant)`, is $1 - f(rr)$.\nSymbolically, `P(Host is resistant)` = $1 - q_H^2$.\nSubstituting the value of $q_H$:\n`P(Host is resistant)` = $1 - (0.25)^2 = 1 - 0.0625 = 0.9375$.\n\nNext, consider the parasite population.\nLet $p_P$ be the frequency of the $A$ allele and $q_P$ be the frequency of the $a$ allele.\nWe are given $p_P = f(A) = 0.40$.\nSince there are only two alleles, $q_P = f(a) = 1 - p_P = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$.\n\nThe parasite is avirulent (i.e., it can be detected by a resistant host) if its genotype is $AA$ or $Aa$. The parasite is virulent (stealthy) if its genotype is $aa$. Since the population is in HWE, the frequency of the virulent genotype $aa$ is $f(aa) = q_P^2$.\nThe probability that a randomly chosen parasite is avirulent, `P(Parasite is avirulent)`, is $1 - f(aa)$.\nSymbolically, `P(Parasite is avirulent)` = $1 - q_P^2$.\nSubstituting the value of $q_P$:\n`P(Parasite is avirulent)` = $1 - (0.60)^2 = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64$.\n\nNow we can calculate the probability of a resistant interaction.\n`P(Resistance) = P(Host is resistant) \\times P(Parasite is avirulent)`\n`P(Resistance)` = $(1 - q_H^2) \\times (1 - q_P^2)$\n`P(Resistance)` = $0.9375 \\times 0.64 = 0.60$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the probability of a successful infection.\n`P(Infection) = 1 - P(Resistance)`\n`P(Infection) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$.\n\nThe question asks for the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n`0.40` can be written as `0.4000` to satisfy this requirement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4000}$$", "id": "1938917"}, {"introduction": "Coevolutionary interactions are rarely static; instead, they often manifest as a dynamic arms race where the selective advantage shifts between host and parasite.

The widespread introduction of Zeon-X causes the frequency of the $Res$ allele in the total cultivated corn population of a large, isolated agricultural valley to increase to nearly 1.0. At the time of introduction, the local pathogen population is composed almost entirely of individuals carrying the avirulence allele $avr$, which is unable to infect corn plants with the $Res$ allele. A corresponding virulence allele, $Vir$, which allows the pathogen to successfully infect $Res$-carrying corn, is present but extremely rare in the pathogen population.\n\nAssume that there is a small but significant metabolic fitness cost associated with carrying the $Res$ allele for the corn (e.g., a slightly reduced yield in a pathogen-free environment) and a similar fitness cost for the pathogen to carry the $Vir$ allele (e.g., a slower replication rate on susceptible corn plants). After thirty years of continuous farming in the valley, during which farmers have dynamically chosen corn varieties to maximize yield, which of the following scenarios most accurately describes the expected state of the allele frequencies in the corn ($Res$) and pathogen ($Vir$) populations, based on the principles of coevolution?\n\nA. Both the $Res$ allele in the corn and the $Vir$ allele in the pathogen have reached fixation (100% frequency), resulting in a permanent, high-level arms race equilibrium.\n\nB. The $Res$ allele has been completely lost from the corn population due to its fitness cost, and consequently, the $Vir$ allele is nearly absent in the pathogen population due to its own cost and lack of selective advantage.\n\nC. The frequencies of the $Res$ allele in the corn and the $Vir$ allele in the pathogen are both at intermediate, non-zero levels and are likely undergoing oscillations over time.\n\nD. The $Res$ allele has been driven to extinction because it provides no benefit, while the $Vir$ allele has reached fixation in the pathogen population.\n\nE. The system has reached a stable equilibrium where the $Res$ allele frequency is 0.5 in the corn and the $avr$ allele frequency is 0.5 in the pathogen.", "solution": "Let $p_{R}$ denote the frequency of the resistance allele in corn, $p_{V}$ the frequency of the virulence allele in the pathogen, $c_{R}0$ the fitness cost of carrying $Res$ in corn, $c_{V}0$ the fitness cost of carrying $Vir$ in the pathogen, and let $D0$ represent the fitness reduction to corn from successful infection.\n\nAssume a standard gene-for-gene interaction:\n- The avirulent pathogen genotype $avr$ can infect only non-resistant corn (lacking $Res$).\n- The virulent pathogen genotype $Vir$ can infect both resistant and non-resistant corn but pays cost $c_{V}$.\n- Corn carrying $Res$ avoids infection by $avr$, but pays cost $c_{R}$; it remains susceptible to $Vir$.\n\nHost fitnesses under random encounter with pathogens are then\n$$\nW_{R}=1-c_{R}-p_{V}D,\\qquad W_{S}=1-D,\n$$\nbecause resistant hosts suffer infection only from $Vir$ (frequency $p_{V}$), while susceptible hosts are infected by both $avr$ and $Vir$ and thus incur $D$ regardless of $p_{V}$.

As $p_{V}$ rises, the condition $p_{V}1-c_{R}/D$ eventually fails, making $Res$ net-costly; farmers optimizing yield will reduce $Res$ usage, decreasing $p_{R}$. When $p_{R}$ falls below $c_{V}$, $Vir$ becomes disfavored due to its cost and declines. As $p_{V}$ declines, $Res$ again confers net benefit when $p_{V}1-c_{R}/D$, prompting increased $Res$ usage. These reciprocal, frequency-dependent selection pressures generate an internal polymorphism and typically yield temporal oscillations (Red Queen dynamics) around intermediate, non-zero frequencies determined by the cost parameters and epidemiological damage $D$, not fixation or a fixed value like $0.5$.\n\nTherefore, after thirty years with dynamic farmer choice and costs on both $Res$ and $Vir$, the most accurate expectation is that both alleles persist at intermediate, non-zero frequencies, likely undergoing oscillations over time.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1938887"}, {"introduction": "A parasite's virulence—the degree of harm it inflicts on its host—is not an arbitrary trait but is itself an product of evolution. The trade-off hypothesis of virulence suggests that parasites evolve to an optimal level of virulence that balances the benefit of increased transmission against the cost of killing the host too quickly. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1853164] illustrates how crucial ecological factors, such as the parasite's mode of transmission, can fundamentally alter this trade-off and shape the evolution of different virulence strategies.", "problem": "In the study of host-parasite coevolution, the \"trade-off hypothesis\" of virulence posits that parasites face an evolutionary trade-off between the rate of transmission to new hosts and the harm (virulence) they inflict upon their current host. Consider a hypothetical scenario involving two closely related species of pathogens that infect the same population of small, mobile mammals.\n\nPathogen Alpha is transmitted directly from host to host through social contact, such as grooming and sharing burrows. Successful transmission of Pathogen Alpha is therefore dependent on the host being mobile and engaging in normal social behaviors.\n\nPathogen Beta is transmitted exclusively by an external vector, a species of biting insect that is attracted to warm-blooded animals regardless of their health or activity level. The insect vector can acquire the pathogen by biting an infected host and can then transmit it to a healthy host in a subsequent bite.\n\nAssuming both pathogens have been coevolving with this host population for a long time, and that higher parasite replication rates within a host lead to both increased virulence (i.e., more severe disease and higher host mortality) and a higher probability of transmission per contact/bite, which of the following statements represents the most likely evolutionary outcome predicted by the trade-off hypothesis?\n\nA. Pathogen Alpha is expected to evolve higher virulence than Pathogen Beta because direct contact is a more efficient transmission mechanism, favoring rapid parasite replication.\n\nB. Pathogen Beta is expected to evolve higher virulence than Pathogen Alpha because its transmission is not dependent on host mobility, thus reducing the selective cost of harming or immobilizing the host.\n\nC. Both pathogens are expected to evolve toward minimal virulence (near-zero), as harming the host is always evolutionarily disadvantageous to the parasite.\n\nD. Both pathogens are expected to evolve a similar intermediate level of virulence, as the primary constraint on virulence is the host's immune system, which is the same for both infections.\n\nE. The virulence of Pathogen Beta is expected to decrease over time, as the biting insects will learn to avoid hosts that are visibly ill.", "solution": "Let $x$ denote the within-host replication rate. By the trade-off hypothesis, higher $x$ increases both virulence and transmission probability per contact or bite. Let $\\beta(x)$ be the probability of transmission per contact/bite with $\\frac{d\\beta}{dx}0$, and let $d(x)$ be the expected duration of infectiousness with $\\frac{dd}{dx}0$ (due to increased host mortality at higher $x$). Let $c$ represent the rate at which potentially infectious contacts or bites occur.\n\nFor Pathogen Alpha (direct contact dependent on host mobility and social behavior), let $c_{A}(x)$ denote the contact rate, with $\\frac{dc_{A}}{dx}0$ because increased virulence reduces host mobility and social interactions. The basic reproductive number can be written as\n$$\nR_{0,A}(x)=c_{A}(x)\\,\\beta(x)\\,d(x).\n$$\nFor Pathogen Beta (vector-borne, with biting independent of host activity per the scenario), let $c_{B}$ denote the vector biting/contact rate, which is approximately independent of host condition, so $\\frac{dc_{B}}{dx}=0$. Its basic reproductive number is\n$$\nR_{0,B}(x)=c_{B}\\,\\beta(x)\\,d(x).\n$$\n\nThe evolutionarily favored virulence corresponds to the value of $x$ that maximizes $R_{0}$.

However, Alpha has the additional negative term $\\frac{d}{dx}\\ln c_{A}(x)0$, which further penalizes increases in $x$. Therefore, for Alpha the marginal cost of increasing $x$ (through reduced contact rate and shorter infectious period) is greater than for Beta, shifting the optimal $x$ to a lower value. Since virulence increases with $x$, the optimal virulence for Alpha is lower than for Beta, while Beta, facing no reduction in contact rate with increasing virulence, evolves a higher optimal $x$ and thus higher virulence.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: although higher $x$ raises per-contact transmission, Alpha’s transmission depends on host mobility, which is reduced by virulence, selecting against very high virulence.\n- B is correct: Beta’s transmission is decoupled from host mobility; thus the selective cost of harming the host is reduced, favoring higher virulence.\n- C is incorrect: the trade-off hypothesis predicts an intermediate optimum, not minimal virulence.\n- D is incorrect: transmission mode alters the cost of virulence beyond host immune constraints.\n- E is incorrect: the scenario states vectors bite regardless of host health; moreover, learning avoidance is not the operative evolutionary mechanism posited here.\n\nTherefore, the trade-off hypothesis predicts higher virulence for the vector-borne Pathogen Beta than for the directly transmitted Pathogen Alpha.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1853164"}]}
