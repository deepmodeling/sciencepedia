The second model, an uncorrelated relaxed clock ($M_R$), posits that each branch has its own evolutionary rate drawn independently from a shared underlying distribution.\n\nTo formally compare these two models in a Bayesian framework, the biologist calculates the marginal likelihood of the data under each model using a computationally intensive method.
