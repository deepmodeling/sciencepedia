This exercise challenges you to connect a key epidemiological event—the emergence of drug resistance from a single source—to its corresponding phylogenetic pattern. Mastering this skill is fundamental for tracking the spread of important viral traits like new variants or resistance mutations. [@problem_id:1953611]", "problem": "In a public health investigation, scientists are tracking the evolution of a novel, rapidly mutating RNA virus. A powerful new antiviral drug has been deployed to treat infected patients. After several months, cases of drug resistance begin to appear. Genetic sequencing of viral samples from a large cohort of patients reveals both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant viral strains. A key hypothesis from the epidemiology team is that the specific genetic mutation conferring drug resistance arose exactly once in a single patient and subsequently spread to other individuals via transmission.\n\nAssuming this single-origin hypothesis is correct, if the scientists construct a phylogenetic tree from the sequences of all sampled viruses (both resistant and sensitive), which of the following patterns would they most likely observe?\n\nA.

The resistant strains will cluster together, but they will not share a single most recent common ancestor that is unique to them.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the pattern of drug-resistant viral strains on a phylogenetic tree, given the crucial information that the resistance mutation occurred only once.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a phylogenetic tree represents. A phylogenetic tree is a diagram that depicts the evolutionary relationships among a group of organisms or, in this case, viruses. The branching pattern illustrates how different lineages diverged from common ancestors over time. The root of the tree represents the most recent common ancestor of all entities in the tree, and the tips (or leaves) represent the individual sampled viruses.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the \"single-origin hypothesis.\" This means that a specific mutation conferring drug resistance arose in the viral population of a single patient at a single point in time. This mutated virus then replicated, and its descendants were passed on to other patients through transmission.\n\nLet's trace the implications of this event on the evolutionary history:\n1.  Before the mutation event, all viruses in the population were drug-sensitive. These ancestral lineages form the \"backbone\" and many of the branches of the phylogenetic tree.\n2.  At one specific point on one of these evolving lineages, the resistance mutation occurs. This point corresponds to an internal node (a common ancestor) on the future phylogenetic tree.\n3.  All viruses that descend from this specific ancestor will inherit the resistance mutation.\n4.  Therefore, the original virus with the mutation and all of its descendants form a distinct lineage of resistant viruses.\n\nNow, let's relate this to phylogenetic terminology. A group that consists of a common ancestor and all of its descendants is called a **monophyletic group**, or a **clade**. Since all the resistant viruses in this scenario share a single common ancestor (the first virus to have the mutation) and this ancestor is unique to them (in the sense that its other relatives, like its sister lineages, are not part of the resistant group), the resistant viruses will form a single, distinct clade on the tree.\n\nLet's analyze the given options based on this understanding:\n\nA. **The resistant strains will form a monophyletic group (a clade).** This is the correct description. The single mutational event creates a single ancestral resistant virus. All subsequent viruses in the transmission chain originating from this event are its descendants. This group, containing the common ancestor and all its descendants, is by definition a monophyle or clade.\n\nB. **The resistant strains will be scattered randomly throughout the tree, intermingled with sensitive strains.** This pattern would be expected if drug resistance emerged independently multiple times in different viral lineages. This phenomenon is known as convergent evolution. It directly contradicts the single-origin hypothesis.\n\nC. **The resistant strains will only be found at the tips of the phylogenetic tree, forming a paraphyletic group.** A paraphyletic group includes a common ancestor but not all of its descendants. The single-origin scenario implies all descendants will carry the trait, not just some of them. While resistant strains are indeed found at the tips of their respective branches, stating they form a paraphyletic group is incorrect and the description is incomplete as it misses the core grouping principle.\n\nD. **The phylogenetic tree will show two distinct clades branching from the root, one containing all resistant strains and the other containing all sensitive strains.** This would imply that the resistance mutation occurred at the very beginning of the outbreak, right at the first common ancestor of all sampled viruses. The problem states that resistance appeared \"after several months\" of the drug's deployment, meaning the mutation happened well after the initial outbreak began, within an already established and diverse viral population.\n\nE. **The resistant strains will cluster together, but they will not share a single most recent common ancestor that is unique to them.** This describes a polyphyletic group, which would arise if the resistant trait appeared in several different lineages that do not share an immediate common ancestor (i.e., convergent evolution), but we incorrectly group them based on the trait. This again contradicts the single-origin hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the only pattern consistent with a single origin for the drug resistance trait is that all resistant viruses will form a single monophyletic group (a clade).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1953611"}, {"introduction": "Phylogenetic reconstruction from real genetic data is a process of statistical inference, meaning results always have some degree of uncertainty. It is therefore crucial to assess how much confidence we should have in any particular relationship shown on a tree.

[@problem_id:1953582]", "problem": "A team of public health researchers is investigating an outbreak of a newly identified pathogen, the \"Coronal Respiratory Virus\" (CRV). They have collected and sequenced the complete viral genomes from infected individuals in four different cities: Alston, Benton, Canton, and Denton. To understand the transmission pathways and evolutionary relationships between these viral isolates, they constructed a phylogenetic tree from the aligned genome sequences.\n\nTo assess the statistical confidence in the branching patterns of their tree, they performed a bootstrap analysis, generating 1000 replicate datasets. In their final tree, a specific branching point (a node) groups the viral isolates from Alston and Benton together into a single clade, to the exclusion of the isolates from Canton and Denton. The bootstrap support value for this specific node is calculated to be 42%.\n\nBased on this information, what is the most accurate interpretation of the bootstrap support value of 42% for the node defining the \"Alston-Benton\" clade?\n\nA. The evolutionary divergence event that separated the Alston-Benton lineage from the other lineages occurred very rapidly.\n\nB. The low value indicates that the viral genomes from Alston and Benton are likely the result of a recombination event between two more distantly related CRV lineages.\n\nC. The entire phylogenetic tree is statistically unreliable, and no conclusions should be drawn from any of the relationships it depicts.\n\nD. There is low statistical confidence in the hypothesis that the viruses from Alston and Benton form a unique monophyletic group; the data does not robustly support this specific grouping over alternative arrangements.\n\nE.
