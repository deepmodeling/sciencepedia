To understand the genetic signature of this introduction, they sequenced a region of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from 200 individual fish sampled across the reservoir. Their analysis revealed a total of six distinct DNA sequences, referred to as haplotypes (H1 through H6).\n\nThe relationships and frequencies of these haplotypes are described as follows:\n-   Haplotype H1 is the most common, found in 185 of the 200 fish.\n-   Haplotypes H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 are all rare, with each being found in only 3 fish.\n-   Genetic analysis shows that each of the rare haplotypes (H2 through H6) differs from the common haplotype H1 by only a single nucleotide substitution.\n-   No haplotype is an intermediate between H1 and any of the other rare haplotypes. For example, H2 does not lie on a mutational path between H1 and H3.\n\nBased on this genetic data, which of the following scenarios provides the most likely explanation for the population history of the Crimson-spotted Minnow in this reservoir?\n\nA. The reservoir was colonized by a large, genetically diverse population from an ancient and stable source.\n\nB. The population in the reservoir has been established for a very long time and has maintained a large, stable size.\n\nC. The population in the reservoir has recently experienced a severe and prolonged population bottleneck, leading to the loss of most genetic diversity.\n\nD. The reservoir was colonized by a small number of founders, followed by a period of rapid population growth and expansion.\n\nE. The reservoir is experiencing continuous migration from two genetically distinct source populations that have recently come into contact.", "solution": "We interpret the mtDNA data as follows. There are six haplotypes, with one dominant haplotype $H1$ found in $185$ of $200$ individuals and five rare haplotypes $H2$–$H6$, each present in $3$ individuals. All rare haplotypes differ from $H1$ by exactly one substitution, and none is intermediate between any other pair. This defines a star-like haplotype network with $H1$ at the center and single-step tips $H2$–$H6$ radiating from it.\n\nUnder standard neutral models (e.g., infinite-sites with no recombination), a recent population expansion from a small number of founders produces (i) a star-like genealogy, (ii) a single high-frequency ancestral haplotype, and (iii) multiple low-frequency derived haplotypes that are one mutational step from the ancestor. Coalescent reasoning: a rapid growth event compresses coalescence times near the present, so most lineages coalesce quickly to a recent common ancestor corresponding to the high-frequency haplotype (here $H1$), while independent new mutations arising on short external branches lead to multiple single-step, low-frequency variants (here $H2$–$H6$). The site-frequency spectrum under such an expansion is skewed toward rare variants, consistent with negative Tajima's $D$ and a star-like haplotype network.\n\nWe exclude the alternatives by contradiction with the observed pattern:\n- Large, genetically diverse source (A) or long-term large, stable population (B) would generate deeper coalescence times, higher haplotype richness, multiple common haplotypes, and multi-step mutational paths with intermediates, not a single dominant haplotype with only one-step rare derivatives.\n- A severe and prolonged bottleneck without subsequent expansion (C) would likely purge diversity to one or very few haplotypes; with a prolonged small effective size, few new mutations would be present in multiple copies across the population within a short calendar time, and the characteristic pattern of several independent one-step low-frequency haplotypes present in multiple individuals is less expected without expansion.\n- Continuous migration from two distinct sources (E) would tend to produce at least two common haplotypes and two clusters separated by multiple mutational steps, not a single central haplotype with all others one step away.\n\nTherefore, the data most parsimoniously indicate a founder event followed by rapid demographic expansion, matching option D: colonization by a small number of founders with subsequent rapid growth, yielding a star-like haplotype network centered on the ancestral haplotype $H1$ and several rare, single-step derivatives.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1954849"}, {"introduction": "This practice explores the profound genetic consequences of large-scale climate change, a central theme in phylogeography. You will apply the concept of serial founder effects to predict how genetic diversity is spatially structured following a species' range expansion from a glacial refugium. Understanding this process is key to interpreting continental-scale patterns of biodiversity [@problem_id:1954825].", "problem": "Imagine a species of flightless beetle, *Cryophilus expandens*, that currently inhabits a wide range of temperate forests in Europe. Paleoclimatological and fossil evidence strongly suggest that during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), approximately 20,000 years ago, the entire species was restricted to a single, large refugium in the Iberian Peninsula (modern-day Spain and Portugal). As the glaciers retreated, the beetles expanded northwards, colonizing the newly available habitats over thousands of years.\n\nAn evolutionary biologist plans to sample two populations to study the genetic legacy of this expansion.\n-   **Population S:** Located in a mountain forest in Northern Spain, near the center of the proposed LGM refugium.\n-   **Population N:** Located in a forest in Southern Sweden, representing the northernmost limit of the species' current range.\n\nAssuming the expansion occurred as a wave of colonization from south to north and that there has been limited gene flow between distant populations since the initial expansion, which of the following statements is the most accurate prediction regarding the neutral genetic diversity (e.g., number of alleles per locus, heterozygosity) of these two populations?\n\nA. Population S will have higher genetic diversity than Population N, because Population N was established through a series of founder events that progressively reduced genetic variation during the northward expansion.\n\nB. Population N will have higher genetic diversity than Population S, because the challenges of colonizing new, harsher northern environments would have spurred rapid mutation and adaptation.\n\nC. Population S and Population N will have approximately equal genetic diversity, because 20,000 years is a sufficient amount of time for gene flow and mutation to homogenize the gene pool across the entire species' range.\n\nD. Population S will have lower genetic diversity than Population N, because the refugial population likely experienced a severe bottleneck during the LGM, while the expanding northern populations grew rapidly.\n\nE. The relative genetic diversity cannot be predicted, as the pattern is primarily determined by unpredictable local events of selection and extinction that occurred independently in each population.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the relative neutral genetic diversity of a southern (\"rear edge\") population and a northern (\"leading edge\") population of a species that expanded from a single glacial refugium. The core principles at play are the founder effect and genetic drift, which are central to the field of phylogeography.\n\nFirst, let's establish the historical context. The entire species survived the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in a single refugium in the Iberian Peninsula. This refugial population contained the total genetic diversity of the species at that time.\n\nSecond, let's consider the process of range expansion. The northward expansion was not an instantaneous movement of the entire population. Instead, it occurred as a \"wave of colonization,\" where small groups of individuals from the edge of the range would migrate a short distance north to establish a new population. This process was repeated over many generations, covering the distance from Spain to Sweden.\n\nThird, we apply the concept of the founder effect. Each time a new population is established by a small number of colonizing individuals, these \"founders\" carry only a subset of the genetic variation present in the larger source population. This random sampling of alleles is a classic example of genetic drift known as the founder effect.\n\nFourth, we consider the cumulative impact of this process, known as \"serial founder effects.\" The first population established just north of the refugium would have experienced one founder effect, resulting in a slight reduction in genetic diversity compared to the refugial population. A population established further north from this new population would experience a second founder effect, and so on. This creates a gradient of decreasing genetic diversity with increasing distance from the original refugium.\n\nNow, let's analyze the two specific populations:\n-   **Population S (Spain):** This population is located within the original LGM refugium. It represents the \"rear edge\" of the expansion. As such, it is the direct descendant of the ancestral source population and has not been subjected to the chain of founder effects that characterized the northward expansion. It is expected to have retained a high level of the ancestral genetic diversity.\n-   **Population N (Sweden):** This population is at the \"leading edge\" of the expansion, the furthest point from the refugium. Its ancestors must have gone through a long series of successive founder events during the multi-millennial journey from Spain. Each step of this journey would have filtered out some genetic diversity. Therefore, Population N is expected to have significantly lower genetic diversity than Population S.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the given options based on this reasoning:\n-   **A:** This statement correctly predicts that Population S will have higher diversity than Population N and correctly attributes this pattern to serial founder events during the northward expansion. This aligns perfectly with our analysis.\n-   **B:** This statement is incorrect. While local adaptation to new environments certainly occurs, it does not typically lead to an overall *increase* in neutral genetic diversity compared to the larger, older source population. The dominant force shaping large-scale patterns of neutral diversity during rapid expansion is genetic drift (founder effects), which causes a loss of variation.\n-   **C:** This statement is incorrect. While gene flow acts to homogenize populations, it is often a slow process, especially for a flightless beetle over continental distances. The strong signature of drift from the rapid post-glacial expansion is a well-documented phenomenon and is not easily erased by subsequent gene flow in such a short evolutionary timeframe.\n-   **D:** This statement incorrectly assesses the effect of the bottleneck. While the refugial population was likely smaller than the total pre-LGM population, it was the source of *all* subsequent diversity. The key process is the *loss* of this diversity during expansion, not a greater bottleneck in the south compared to the expansion process itself. The expansion process is a series of bottlenecks.\n-   **E:** This statement is incorrect. While local events do matter, the large-scale, directional process of post-glacial expansion from a single refugium creates a highly predictable continental-scale pattern of genetic diversity (a south-to-north decline). It is one of the most classic and robust patterns in phylogeography.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that the southern population (S) will be more genetically diverse than the northern population (N).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1954825"}, {"introduction": "This final exercise challenges you to act like a research scientist by using multiple lines of genetic evidence to test competing historical hypotheses. By synthesizing data on both within-population diversity ($\\pi$) and between-population differentiation ($F_{ST}$), you will learn to distinguish between scenarios of long-term isolation in multiple refugia versus expansion from a single source.

Two primary hypotheses are under consideration. The first, the \"Single Large Refuge Hypothesis\" (SLRH), posits that the entire species survived in one large, continuous refuge in a southern, lower-elevation area and subsequently re-colonized the higher mountains after the glaciers retreated. The second, the \"Multiple Microrefugia Hypothesis\" (MMH), suggests that several small, isolated populations persisted in distinct, geographically separated microrefugia (e.g., warmer, unglaciated mountain valleys) and expanded locally after the climate warmed.\n\nTo test these hypotheses, the researcher sampled individuals from four geographically distinct mountain-top populations, labeled A, B, C, and D. For each population, a large set of nuclear genetic markers was analyzed to calculate two standard population genetic summary statistics: nucleotide diversity ($\\pi$), which measures the average number of nucleotide differences per site between any two DNA sequences chosen randomly from a population, and pairwise Wright's Fixation Index ($F_{ST}$), which quantifies the level of genetic differentiation between two populations. The collected data are presented in the tables below. $F_{ST}$ values range from 0 (no differentiation) to 1 (complete differentiation).\n\n**Table 1: Within-Population Nucleotide Diversity**\n| Population | Nucleotide Diversity ($\\pi$) |\n|------------|------------------------------|\n| A          | 0.012                        |\n| B          | 0.011                        |\n| C          | 0.013                        |\n| D          | 0.015                        |\n\n**Table 2: Pairwise Population Differentiation ($F_{ST}$)**\n|            | Population A | Population B | Population C | Population D |\n|------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Population A |      -       |              |              |              |\n| Population B |     0.05     |      -       |              |              |\n| Population C |     0.45     |     0.48     |      -       |              |\n| Population D |     0.42     |     0.46     |     0.04     |      -       |\n\nBased on a rigorous interpretation of these data, which of the following conclusions is the most strongly supported?\n\nA. The MMH is supported, because the $F_{ST}$ values indicate the existence of at least two deeply divergent genetic clusters, each cluster having low internal differentiation, which is consistent with long-term isolation in separate refugia.\n\nB. The SLRH is supported, because the high nucleotide diversity in all populations suggests a large, stable ancestral population, and the variation in $F_{ST}$ values is best explained by a simple pattern of isolation-by-distance during post-glacial expansion.\n\nC. The MMH is supported, because the low nucleotide diversity across all populations points to severe bottlenecks expected from survival in small, isolated refugia.\n\nD. The SLRH is supported, because the low $F_{ST}$ values (e.g., between A-B and C-D) indicate significant recent gene flow among all populations, which would have homogenized them after expansion from a single source.\n\nE. The data are inconclusive, as high nucleotide diversity supports the SLRH while high $F_{ST}$ values support the MMH, presenting a contradictory signal that cannot distinguish between the two hypotheses.", "solution": "We interpret the two summary statistics in light of expectations under the Single Large Refuge Hypothesis (SLRH) and the Multiple Microrefugia Hypothesis (MMH). The statistic $\\pi$ measures within-population genetic variation; higher values indicate larger long-term effective size or retention of ancestral diversity. The statistic $F_{ST}$ measures relative genetic differentiation between populations; values near $0$ indicate little differentiation (suggesting recent common ancestry or ongoing gene flow), whereas values approaching $1$ indicate deep divergence (suggesting long-term isolation).\n\nExpectations under SLRH: If the species persisted in a single large refuge and subsequently recolonized, then after post-glacial expansion one expects relatively low $F_{ST}$ among all populations (recent common source and homogenization), possibly a shallow pattern of isolation-by-distance rather than discrete, deeply divergent clusters. Nucleotide diversity $\\pi$ might be moderate to high if the ancestral refuge was large, but high $\\pi$ alone is not diagnostic of SLRH; crucially, a single source should not produce pairs of populations that are deeply subdivided relative to others, unless there has been extensive, recent post-expansion isolation driving strong divergence, which would typically be more gradual or clinal across geography rather than forming two tightly cohesive clusters.\n\nExpectations under MMH: If multiple small, isolated refugia existed, then populations descending from different refugia should show high $F_{ST}$ between them (deep divergence due to long-term isolation), while populations within the same refugium should show low $F_{ST}$ (shared history and potential local connectivity). Nucleotide diversity $\\pi$ under MMH need not be uniformly low; if refugia maintained sufficient effective sizes over time, $\\pi$ can remain moderate to high. Thus, MMH predicts a pattern of discrete clusters with low internal $F_{ST}$ and high between-cluster $F_{ST}$.\n\nEvaluate the data:\n1) Pairwise $F_{ST}$ shows two clear clusters:\n- Within-cluster low differentiation: $F_{ST}(\\text{A,B}) = 0.05$ and $F_{ST}(\\text{C,D}) = 0.04$ indicate little differentiation within each pair.\n- Between-cluster high differentiation: $F_{ST}$ between A or B versus C or D ranges from $0.42$ to $0.48$, indicating deep divergence between these groups.\nThis discrete two-cluster structure (AB versus CD) with low within-cluster and high between-cluster $F_{ST}$ strongly matches MMH expectations of long-term isolation in separate refugia, followed by local expansion.\n\n2) Within-population nucleotide diversity $\\pi$ is similar and relatively high across all populations (A: $0.012$, B: $0.011$, C: $0.013$, D: $0.015$). These values do not indicate severe bottlenecks; they are consistent with refugia that maintained reasonable effective sizes. Therefore, the data do not support the claim that low $\\pi$ across all populations occurred.\n\nAssess the options:\n- A: Supported. The $F_{ST}$ matrix indicates two deeply divergent clusters (AB and CD) with low internal differentiation and high inter-cluster differentiation, consistent with long-term isolation in separate refugia under MMH; the $\\pi$ values do not contradict this.\n- B: Not supported. SLRH would predict low differentiation across all populations or a smooth isolation-by-distance pattern, not two sharply distinct clusters with $F_{ST}$ near one-half between them.\n- C: Not supported. It asserts low nucleotide diversity, which is contradicted by the observed $\\pi$ values.\n- D: Not supported. It generalizes low $F_{ST}$ to all populations, but between-cluster $F_{ST}$ is high, contradicting recent homogenization from a single source.\n- E: Not supported. The signals are not contradictory: high $\\pi$ with structured, high between-cluster $F_{ST}$ coherently supports MMH with sizeable refugia.\n\nTherefore, the most strongly supported conclusion is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1954823"}]}
