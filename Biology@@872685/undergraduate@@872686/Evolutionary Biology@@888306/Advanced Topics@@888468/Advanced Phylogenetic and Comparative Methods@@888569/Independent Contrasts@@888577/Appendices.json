This common scenario forces us to confront the confounding effects of shared ancestry. The following thought experiment [@problem_id:1940602] presents just such a case, challenging you to deduce the most likely evolutionary explanation when an apparent correlation disappears after accounting for phylogeny.", "problem": "An astrobiologist is studying a group of 30 recently discovered species of \"Lithovores,\" organisms that metabolize rock on a distant exoplanet. The biologist proposes a hypothesis that species with larger mandibles (for crushing rock) are able to support a larger body mass. To test this, the biologist measures the average mandible size and average body mass for all 30 species and creates a scatterplot. The plot reveals a strong, statistically significant positive correlation between mandible size and body mass.\n\nHowever, being a careful researcher, the biologist recognizes that these species are not independent data points because they share evolutionary history. Using DNA sequence data, a robust phylogenetic tree is constructed for the 30 species. The biologist then applies the method of Phylogenetic Independent Contrasts (PIC) to analyze the relationship between mandible size and body mass. After this analysis, the correlation is no longer statistically significant.\n\nAssuming the measurements and the phylogenetic tree are accurate, what is the most likely explanation for the discrepancy between the analysis of the raw species data and the PIC analysis?\n\nA. The two traits, mandible size and body mass, are not actually evolving in a correlated manner. The initial correlation was a non-causal artifact created because large-bodied, large-mandibled species were all concentrated in one or more closely related groups (clades) due to shared ancestry.\n\nB. The sample size of 30 species is too small to obtain a significant result using the PIC method, which is known to be less powerful than simple linear regression.\n\nC. The strong correlation in the raw data was caused by a consistent measurement error that biased both mandible size and body mass in the same direction, an effect that the PIC method corrects for.\n\nD. The relationship between mandible size and body mass is an example of developmental plasticity, where individuals grow larger mandibles in response to having a larger body, a phenomenon that PIC is not designed to detect.\n\nE. The evolutionary process at work is directional selection, pushing all species towards larger mandibles and larger bodies over time, which invalidates the statistical assumptions of the PIC method.", "solution": "The central issue this problem addresses is the non-independence of data points in comparative studies of species. Species are related by a history of shared ancestry, which means they are not independent samples from a statistical perspective. The method of Phylogenetic Independent Contrasts (PIC) is specifically designed to correct for this non-independence.\n\nFirst, let's understand why the initial analysis of raw species data might be misleading. If an ancestral species happened to evolve both large mandibles and a large body mass, all of its descendant species would likely inherit both of these traits. If this clade of descendants makes up a substantial portion of the 30 species sampled, it would create a cluster of points on the scatterplot with high values for both variables. Similarly, if another ancestral species was small-bodied with small mandibles, its descendants would form another cluster. These clusters, driven by shared history rather than an ongoing evolutionary correlation between the traits, can create a strong, but spurious, positive correlation when all species are plotted together. This is a classic example of \"phylogenetic pseudoreplication.\"\n\nThe PIC method transforms the species trait data to account for this shared history. Instead of comparing the trait values of the species themselves (which are the tips of the phylogenetic tree), PIC calculates a set of \"contrasts\" for each internal node of the tree. Each contrast represents the difference in trait values between the two lineages descending from that node, standardized by the amount of evolutionary time (branch length) that separates them. These calculated contrasts are phylogenetically independent of each other and represent independent instances of evolutionary divergence. Therefore, a correlation analysis performed on these contrasts tests whether the two traits have a tendency to evolve together.\n\nIn this problem, the raw data showed a strong correlation, but the PIC analysis, which controls for phylogeny, showed no significant correlation. This directly implies that the initial correlation was an artifact of the phylogenetic relationships among the species, not a result of the two traits being functionally or genetically linked in their evolution. The PIC method \"removed\" the confounding effect of shared ancestry, revealing the underlying lack of a correlated evolutionary trend between mandible size and body mass.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. This option correctly identifies the issue. It states that the initial correlation was an artifact of phylogenetic history (i.e., closely related species sharing traits from a common ancestor) and that the traits are not truly evolving in a correlated fashion. This is precisely the scenario that PIC is designed to identify. The disappearance of the correlation after PIC analysis is the classic signature of this effect.\n\nB. This statement is incorrect. While it is true that statistical power can be a concern, there is no reason to assume that 30 species is inherently too small for a PIC analysis. More importantly, PIC doesn't necessarily have less power; it has the *correct* power for the question being asked (about evolutionary correlation). Attributing the result to low power is less parsimonious than attributing it to the very effect PIC is designed to measure.\n\nC. PIC corrects for phylogenetic non-independence, not for systematic measurement error. If a consistent error created an artificial correlation, it would likely persist in some form even after the PIC transformation, as the error would be present in the tip data from which contrasts are calculated. PIC is a statistical tool for evolutionary biology, not a tool for correcting faulty data collection.\n\nD. Developmental plasticity (phenotypic changes within an individual's lifetime) is a different level of analysis from macroevolutionary correlation across species. PIC analyzes the patterns of change between species over evolutionary time. While plasticity is a real biological phenomenon, it is not what PIC is designed to test for or distinguish from heritable evolutionary change. The discrepancy between the two statistical methods points to a phylogenetic artifact, not a confusion between plasticity and evolution.\n\nE. Directional selection acting on both traits does not inherently invalidate the PIC method. PIC calculates the differences between diverging sister lineages. If both lineages are under directional selection, the contrast simply reflects the differential change between them. PIC would still be the correct tool to ask if the *rate or direction* of change in one trait is correlated with the *rate or direction* of change in the other. A lack of correlation in PIC results would suggest that even under directional selection, the evolution of the two traits is not coupled.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1940602"}, {"introduction": "Like any statistical model, the independent contrasts method rests on a set of assumptions about the evolutionary process, most commonly a Brownian motion model.

To account for the non-independence of species data due to shared ancestry, she employs the method of Phylogenetic Independent Contrasts (PIC). This method models trait evolution using a Brownian Motion (BM) model, which makes several key assumptions. One core assumption is that the rate of trait evolution (the variance of change per unit time, $\\sigma^2$) is constant across all branches of the phylogenetic tree.\n\nAfter calculating the standardized independent contrasts for her dataset, she creates a diagnostic plot to check the adequacy of the BM model. The plot shows the absolute value of each standardized contrast on the y-axis versus the corresponding nodal height on the x-axis, where nodal height is defined as the time elapsed from the root of the tree to that node. Upon performing a linear regression on these points, she finds a statistically significant positive correlation.\n\nGiven this specific result, which of the following core assumptions of the standard Brownian Motion model is most directly and clearly violated?\n\nA.

Consequently, under the BM assumption of constant rate, there should be no correlation between $|C_{i}|$ and nodal height.\n\nEmpirically, the researcher finds a statistically significant positive correlation between $|C_{i}|$ and nodal height. This implies that the dispersion of contrasts increases systematically with time from the root, i.e., older versus younger nodes exhibit different magnitudes after standardization. Formally, this indicates that\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(C_{i}\\mid \\text{height}=h_{i})=\\tau^{2}(h_{i})\n$$\nwith $\\tau^{2}(h_{i})$ increasing in $h_{i}$, which cannot occur if $\\sigma^{2}$ is constant, because the standardization is constructed to remove the effect of branch-length differences under a homogeneous rate.\n\nTherefore, the most directly and clearly violated BM assumption indicated by the positive correlation of $|C_{i}|$ with nodal height is the constancy of the evolutionary rate $\\sigma^{2}$ across the tree.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are not directly implicated by a trend in contrast magnitude with nodal height: normality (B) concerns the shape of the distribution, independence (C) concerns correlations among branches, and the root state (D) is irrelevant for contrasts.
