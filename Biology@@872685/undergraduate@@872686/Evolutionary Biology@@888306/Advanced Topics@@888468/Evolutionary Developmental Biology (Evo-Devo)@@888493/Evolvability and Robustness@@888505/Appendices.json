Its cells are perfectly spherical, a shape that is optimal for this environment. This \"robust\" phenotype is determined by a genetic locus. Let's call the wild-type strain 'Strain R'. Through mutation, a new variant, 'Strain E', can arise. Strain E exhibits phenotypic plasticity, meaning it can alter its cell shape. This plasticity, however, comes at a metabolic cost. In the original open liquid environment, Strain E has a relative reproductive fitness that is 4% lower than that of Strain R.\n\nA new environmental niche becomes accessible to the population. This new niche consists of a network of microscopic crevices. The robust, spherical Strain R cannot colonize these crevices and fails to reproduce there. In contrast, the plastic Strain E can deform its shape to fit within the crevices, where it thrives, achieving a relative reproductive fitness that is 80% higher than Strain R's fitness in the original open liquid environment.\n\nConsider a metapopulation model where the bacteria are distributed across both the original open liquid environment and the new crevice environment. After reproduction, the offspring are randomly dispersed throughout the total combined habitat. Let $p_{crevice}$ represent the fraction of the total habitat volume that consists of crevices, with the remaining fraction ($1 - p_{crevice}$) being the open liquid environment.\n\nAssuming that Strain E is initially rare (having just arisen by mutation), determine the minimum value of $p_{crevice}$ that would allow the 'evolvable' Strain E to successfully invade the population (i.e., for its frequency to increase from a very low value).
