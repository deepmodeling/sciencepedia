This practice delves into the crucial distinction between arithmetic and geometric mean fitness, the cornerstone of bet-hedging theory.

The plant is dioecious, meaning individuals are either male or female. A parent plant can control the sex ratio of the seeds it produces. The reproductive success of its offspring (measured in the number of surviving grand-offspring each produces) depends on the environmental conditions of the year they mature in, as follows:\n\n*   In a **Wet year**: The average son produces 0.5 grand-offspring. The average daughter produces 2.0 grand-offspring.\n*   In a **Dry year**: The average son produces 5.0 grand-offspring. The average daughter produces 1.0 grand-offspring.\n\nWe will compare two different reproductive strategies a parent plant could employ:\n\n*   **Strategy A (The \"Arithmetic-Mean Maximizer\"):** This strategy involves producing only the sex that has the higher arithmetic mean reproductive success, averaged across both Wet and Dry years.\n*   **Strategy B (The \"Bet-Hedger\"):** This strategy involves producing an equal number of sons and daughters (a 1:1 sex ratio).\n\nIn evolutionary biology, the long-term fitness of a lineage in a fluctuating environment is best measured by the geometric mean of its reproductive output across generations, not the arithmetic mean, because population growth is a multiplicative process.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the long-term fitness of Strategy B to the long-term fitness of Strategy A.

This exercise models a classic evolutionary trade-off faced by a sessile organism: how much energy to allocate to risky local growth versus safer, but less efficient, dispersal. By calculating the optimal allocation fraction that maximizes fitness in the face of potential catastrophe, you will develop skills in optimization and gain a deeper intuition for how organisms manage risk. [@problem_id:1911540]", "problem": "A species of sessile, colonial marine organism, similar to a coral, faces an evolutionary trade-off in its resource allocation strategy. Each year, an established colony allocates its total available energy between two functions: colonial growth and larval dispersal. A fraction of energy, $(1-x)$, is invested in increasing the size of the parent colony, while the remaining fraction, $x$, is used to produce mobile larvae that disperse to establish new colonies.\n\nThe returns on these investments are defined as follows:\n- An investment in growth yields a reproductive return factor of $g$. That is, one unit of energy invested in growth increases the colony's reproductive potential by a factor of $g$ in the following year. It is given that $g > 1$.\n- An investment in dispersal yields a reproductive return factor of $b$. That is, one unit of energy invested in dispersal results in a total reproductive potential of $b$ from all newly founded colonies in the following year. Typically, growing an existing colony is more efficient than establishing new ones, so it is given that $g > b$.\n\nThe environment is unpredictable. Each year, there is a small but non-zero probability, $p$, of a catastrophic event (e.g., a localized storm or disease outbreak) that completely destroys the parent colony. The larvae, having already dispersed, are unaffected by this event. If the catastrophe does not occur (with probability $1-p$), the parent colony survives.\n\nNatural selection is expected to favor an allocation strategy, $x$, that maximizes the long-term geometric mean fitness of the lineage.
