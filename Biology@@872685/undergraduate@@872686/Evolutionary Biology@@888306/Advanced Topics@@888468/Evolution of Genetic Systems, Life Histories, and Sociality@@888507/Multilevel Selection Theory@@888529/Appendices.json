You will track the frequency of an altruistic allele and see how it can decrease within every single sub-group, yet increase in the population as a whole—a classic example of Simpson's Paradox.

The voles are organized into a metapopulation consisting of 100 distinct colonies, each with a fixed size of 50 individuals.\n\nWithin this population, a gene controls a key cooperative behavior. The altruistic allele, $H$, causes an individual to engage in a special \"shivering\" behavior that generates communal heat in the burrow, increasing the colony's chance of surviving the winter. This behavior comes at a personal metabolic cost. The selfish allele, $h$, does not confer this behavior, allowing the individual to conserve its energy.\n\nAt the start of the season, the metapopulation is heterogeneous. 50 of the colonies are \"High-H,\" where the initial frequency of the $H$ allele is $p_{H, \\text{initial}} = 0.80$. The remaining 50 colonies are \"Low-H,\" with an initial $H$ allele frequency of $p_{L, \\text{initial}} = 0.30$.\n\nThe evolutionary dynamics unfold in two stages over a single year:\n\n1.  **Within-Colony Selection:** During the summer and autumn, individuals with the selfish $h$ allele have a slight survival and reproductive advantage within every colony because they conserve energy. This leads to a decrease in the frequency of the $H$ allele.\n    *   In each of the High-H colonies, the frequency of the $H$ allele drops from $0.80$ to an end-of-season frequency of $p'_{H} = 0.75$.\n    *   In each of the Low-H colonies, the frequency of the $H$ allele drops from $0.30$ to an end-of-season frequency of $p'_{L} = 0.25$.\n    The size of each colony remains at 50 individuals just before winter.\n\n2.  **Between-Colony Selection:** The harshness of the winter imposes a form of group selection. A colony's survival depends on the total amount of communal heat generated, which is directly related to its frequency of $H$ alleles at the end of the season. A colony survives the winter only if its end-of-season allele frequency ($p'$) is greater than or equal to a critical thermal threshold of $0.50$. Any colony with an allele frequency below this threshold perishes entirely.\n\nFollowing the winter, all individuals from the surviving colonies disperse and form a single, randomly mating gene pool that will found the next generation's colonies.\n\nCalculate the net change in the frequency of the altruistic $H$ allele in the total metapopulation, from the start of the season to the formation of the new gene pool after winter.

Cooperators produce a beneficial public good, an exopolysaccharide (EPS), which helps protect the entire colony from environmental stress. This production, however, incurs a metabolic cost. Defectors do not produce EPS and thus pay no cost.\n\nThe fitness of an individual bacterium is determined by a baseline fitness (normalized to 1), the cost of cooperation (if any), and the benefit from the EPS present in the colony.

The fitness benefit for any individual in the colony is given by $\\beta p$, where $\\beta$ is a positive constant representing the effectiveness of the EPS.\n\nThe metabolic cost of producing EPS is not constant.

If increasing the proportion of cooperators actually decreases a colony's productivity, then within-group selection, which always favors defectors, will drive cooperators to extinction without any countervailing force.\n\nDetermine the maximum possible colony size, $N_{max}$, beyond which group-level selection ceases to favor cooperation.
