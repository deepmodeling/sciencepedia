The payoff for an individual using strategy $I$ when encountering an opponent using strategy $J$ is denoted by $E(I, J)$.\n\nThe observed average payoffs are given as follows:\n- When a \"Sit-and-Wait\" lizard encounters another \"Sit-and-Wait\" lizard, the payoff is $E(S, S) = 5$.\n- When a \"Sit-and-Wait\" lizard encounters an \"Active-Forage\" lizard, the payoff is $E(S, A) = 2$.\n- When an \"Active-Forage\" lizard encounters a \"Sit-and-Wait\" lizard, the payoff is $E(A, S) = 6$.\n- When an \"Active-Forage\" lizard encounters another \"Active-Forage\" lizard, the payoff is $E(A, A) = 3$.\n\nAn Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS) is a strategy which, if adopted by a population of players, cannot be invaded by any alternative strategy that is initially rare.

This problem introduces the concept of a mixed ESS, where stability is achieved at a specific frequency of different behaviors in the population.

Consider a hypothetical species of fish, the Lythrian Pipefish, where males exhibit one of two distinct reproductive strategies.\n\n1.  **Guarder Strategy**: Large, territorial males build and defend nests. Females are attracted to these nests to lay their eggs, which the Guarder male then fertilizes and protects.\n2.  **Sneaker Strategy**: Smaller, non-territorial males do not build nests. Instead, they attempt to locate a Guarder's nest and surreptitiously fertilize some of the eggs laid by visiting females.\n\nThe reproductive success (fitness) of a male depends on its chosen strategy and the prevalence of the other strategy in the population. This can be summarized by a payoff matrix, which quantifies the average fitness units gained by an individual employing a \"Focal Strategy\" when interacting with a random individual employing an \"Opponent Strategy\". The payoff matrix for the Lythrian Pipefish is given as:\n\n| | Opponent Strategy: Guarder | Opponent Strategy: Sneaker |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Focal Strategy: Guarder** | 5 | 8 |\n| **Focal Strategy: Sneaker** | 10 | 0 |\n\nThe value of 0 for a Sneaker meeting a Sneaker reflects the fact that if there are no Guarders to establish nests, the Sneaker strategy yields no reproductive success.\n\nAssuming the population frequencies of these strategies evolve to an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS), what is the equilibrium frequency of the Sneaker strategy?

The success of their offspring is critically dependent on the quality of this shared nest. An individual's strategy is defined by the proportion of its daily effort, $x \\in [0, 1]$, that it invests in nest construction.\n\nThe reproductive benefit, measured in fitness units, is a shared resource for the pair. It depends on the total investment from both partners, $X = x_1 + x_2$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the investment levels of the two individuals. This benefit follows a saturating function given by:\n$$B(X) = \\frac{B_0 X}{K+X}$$\nHere, $B_0$ is the maximum possible benefit, and $K$ is a saturation constant that determines how quickly the benefit approaches its maximum.\n\nThe investment has a direct cost to the individual, representing energy and time diverted from other survival activities. This cost is linear with the individual's own investment level, $x_i$, and is given by:\n$$C(x_i) = c x_i$$\nwhere $c$ is the marginal cost of investment.\n\nThe net fitness payoff for individual 1 is therefore $W(x_1, x_2) = B(x_1+x_2) - C(x_1)$.\n\nConsider a large population where individuals are paired randomly for nest building.
