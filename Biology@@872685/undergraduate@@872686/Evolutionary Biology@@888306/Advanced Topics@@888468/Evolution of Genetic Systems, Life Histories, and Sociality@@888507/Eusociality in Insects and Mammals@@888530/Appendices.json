{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The scientific study of any biological phenomenon begins with a precise definition. This exercise challenges you to act as a field biologist and apply the three core criteria of eusociality—cooperative brood care, overlapping generations, and reproductive division of labor—to determine if a newly discovered species truly fits this rare and complex social structure.", "problem": "An entomology research team is studying a newly discovered species of gall-forming thrips, which they have named *Thrips adamantinus*. The thrips live in large, sealed plant galls. The team's observations of their social structure have revealed the following key characteristics:\n1.  Multiple generations of adult thrips coexist within a single gall, meaning offspring and their parents are simultaneously present and active in the colony.\n2.  Adult females collectively care for the brood, providing food and defense to all larvae within the gall, not just their own direct offspring.\n3.  Through careful marking and long-term observation, it was determined that all adult females in a colony are fertile and successfully reproduce at some point during their lives. While there is some variation in fecundity (number of eggs laid), no distinct, non-reproductive 'worker' or 'soldier' caste exists.\n\nBased on the established biological criteria for social systems, which of the following statements most accurately classifies the social structure of *Thrips adamantinus*?\n\nA. The species is eusocial because it exhibits both cooperative brood care and overlapping generations.\n\nB. The species is eusocial because all females contribute to reproduction, which is a hallmark of primitively eusocial systems.\n\nC. The species is not eusocial because it lacks a reproductive division of labor into distinct castes, a necessary criterion.\n\nD. The species is communal because multiple generations live together in the same nest.", "solution": "Eusociality is defined by three jointly required criteria: cooperative brood care, overlapping generations of adults and their offspring, and reproductive division of labor, in which at least some adults specialize as non-reproductives (workers or soldiers), even if there is no morphological caste differentiation in primitively eusocial systems.\n\nApplying these criteria to Thrips adamantinus:\n- The observations describe overlapping generations: multiple generations of adult thrips coexist within a gall.\n- The observations describe cooperative brood care: adult females care for all larvae, not just their own.\n- However, all adult females are fertile and successfully reproduce during their lives, and there is no distinct non-reproductive caste. Therefore, there is no reproductive division of labor.\n\nBecause the reproductive division of labor criterion is not met, the species is not eusocial. This eliminates options A and B, both of which assert eusociality. Option D incorrectly classifies the system as communal; in communal systems, females share a nest but each tends only her own brood, and communal sociality does not depend on overlapping generations. The described system most closely matches quasisociality (cooperative brood care with all females reproducing), but since that choice is not offered, the most accurate statement among the options is that the species is not eusocial due to lacking reproductive division of labor.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1922331"}, {"introduction": "The evolution of altruistic behavior, the bedrock of eusociality, is explained by kin selection, which is mathematically expressed through the coefficient of relatedness, $r$. While the high relatedness ($r=0.75$) between full sisters in haplodiploid species offers a powerful explanation, the reality in many insect societies is more complex. This problem [@problem_id:1922313] guides you through calculating the average relatedness in a colony founded by a polyandrous queen, demonstrating how real-world mating systems modify the predictions of kin selection theory.", "problem": "In the study of evolutionary biology, the genetic system of a species can have profound effects on its social structure. Consider a hypothetical species of eusocial insect, which exhibits a haplodiploid sex-determination system. In this system, males develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid, while females develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid.\n\nA young queen of this species embarks on a single mating flight and mates with exactly three unrelated males. She stores the sperm from all three males and subsequently uses it in equal proportions to fertilize the eggs that will develop into the female workers of her new colony. All workers in the colony are daughters of this single queen.\n\nAssuming this mating pattern, what is the average coefficient of relatedness between any two randomly selected female workers in this colony?\n\nA. $1/4$\n\nB. $1/3$\n\nC. $5/12$\n\nD. $1/2$\n\nE. $3/4$", "solution": "We want the average coefficient of relatedness between two randomly chosen female workers in a haplodiploid system where a single queen mates with exactly three unrelated males and uses stored sperm in equal proportions.\n\nFirst, classify pairs of workers:\n- With probability that both workers share the same father, they are full sisters.\n- With the complementary probability, they have different fathers and are half sisters (but share the same mother).\n\nBecause the queen uses sperm from each of three males in equal proportion, the probability that two independently chosen workers have the same father is the sum of squared sire proportions:\n$$\nP(\\text{same father})=\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{2}=\\frac{1}{3}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nP(\\text{different fathers})=1-\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{2}{3}.\n$$\n\nNext, compute relatedness values under haplodiploidy:\n- Full sisters (same father): Each daughter receives exactly the same paternal haploid genome, so the paternal half is identical by descent with probability 1. From the diploid mother, each daughter receives one allele at random; the probability that two daughters receive the same maternal allele is $\\frac{1}{2}$.

A central question is how individuals develop into distinct reproductive (queen) and non-reproductive (worker) castes. This practice exercise [@problem_id:1922343] puts you in the role of an experimental biologist, tasking you with designing a conclusive experiment to distinguish between genetic and environmental triggers for caste differentiation, a core skill for testing hypotheses in biology.", "problem": "An entomologist discovers a new species of eusocial ant, provisionally named *Myrmica experimentalis*. This species exhibits clear caste differentiation, with morphologically distinct queens and workers. Two primary hypotheses are proposed to explain the mechanism of caste determination.\n\n**Hypothesis 1 (Environmental Determinism):** Caste is determined by the quality and quantity of nutrition received during the larval stage. All female larvae are genetically totipotent, but only those fed a specific, protein-rich \"royal jelly\" develop into queens.\n\n**Hypothesis 2 (Genetic Determinism):** Caste is predetermined by the larva's genotype. A specific genetic locus or a combination of alleles directs development towards either a queen or a worker phenotype, regardless of nutrition.\n\nYou are tasked with designing a single experiment to most definitively distinguish between these two hypotheses. Which of the following experimental plans provides the most direct and conclusive test?\n\nA. Sequence the complete genomes of a random sample of adult queens and adult workers from multiple colonies to identify any consistent genetic polymorphisms correlated with caste.\n\nB. Use high-performance liquid chromatography to analyze and compare the chemical composition of the food regurgitated by nurse ants to larvae developing in queen cells versus larvae in worker cells.\n\nC. Selectively breed queens and males that have produced a high ratio of queens in the past and observe if this trait is heritable over several generations.\n\nD. In a controlled laboratory nest, carefully transfer a set of newly-hatched larvae from their original worker-rearing cells into queen-rearing cells, and simultaneously transfer larvae from queen-rearing cells into worker-rearing cells. Then, observe their developmental outcomes.\n\nE. Drastically alter the temperature and humidity conditions of the nest, which are known to affect metabolic rates, and record any changes in the queen-to-worker ratio produced by the colony.", "solution": "Goal: Discriminate between environmental determinism (nutrition during larval stage governs caste) and genetic determinism (genotype predetermines caste irrespective of nutrition) using a single, decisive experiment.\n\nLogical predictions:\n- Under environmental determinism, larval fate depends on rearing environment and provisioning. Therefore, larvae placed into queen-rearing conditions (including access to the specific protein-rich diet) should develop into queens, regardless of their genetic origin, and larvae placed into worker-rearing conditions should develop into workers.\n- Under genetic determinism, larval fate depends on genotype. Therefore, exchanging the rearing environment should not change outcomes; larvae genetically destined to be queens will develop as queens even if placed in worker-rearing conditions, and vice versa.\n\nEvaluation of experimental plans:\n- Option A (genome sequencing): Correlation between genotype and caste would be suggestive of genetic influence but not causal; absence of consistent polymorphisms would not rule out polygenic, regulatory, or epigenetic mechanisms. It does not directly manipulate environment versus genotype to test causality and cannot definitively distinguish the hypotheses.\n- Option B (nutritional chemical profiling): Demonstrating different food composition is consistent with environmental determinism but does not establish causality (differences could be a consequence rather than a cause of caste trajectory). It does not test whether changing the food switches caste.\n- Option C (selective breeding): Apparent heritability of queen ratio could be confounded by maternal effects, colony-level social environment, or nurse behavior. It is indirect and not decisive in separating genetic from environmental determination.\n- Option D (reciprocal cross-fostering of larvae between queen and worker rearing cells): This directly manipulates the environment while holding genotype constant for each larva. Decisive predictions: If environmental determinism is correct, caste will follow the rearing condition; if genetic determinism is correct, caste will follow the larva’s origin genotype and be insensitive to rearing condition. With appropriate controls (age-matched larvae at the same instar, marking transferred larvae, standardized nurse populations, blinding outcome assessment), this provides a direct and conclusive test.\n- Option E (altering temperature/humidity): Changes in ratio would show environmental sensitivity but are nonspecific and do not isolate the proposed nutritional mechanism; lack of effect would not prove genetic determinism. It is not definitive.\n\nConclusion: The reciprocal transfer of larvae between queen and worker rearing environments offers a direct, causal test that cleanly distinguishes the two hypotheses in a single experiment. Therefore, option D is the most definitive.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1922343"}]}
