This next problem explores what happens when the \"cost\" of producing a son is different from that of a daughter, a common situation in species where one sex may require more resources or parental care. By deriving the evolutionarily stable sex ratio from first principles when costs are unequal, you will see how the logic of equal investment, not just equal numbers, governs the evolution of sex allocation [@problem_id:2709671].", "problem": "A large, randomly mating, sexually reproducing population has maternal control of the primary sex ratio, defined as the fraction of zygotes that are male at conception. Assume equal mating opportunity among individuals of the same sex, no differential viability or fertility after birth beyond the sex-specific production costs, and that maternal investment is the sole limiting resource. Let the cost to produce one son be $c_m$ and the cost to produce one daughter be $c_f$, with costs measured in identical resource units. Each mother has a fixed budget $B$ and can continuously allocate a fraction $x$ of her budget to sons and the remainder $1-x$ to daughters. Assume that offspring of a given sex are identical in expected viability and future mating success conditional on population sex ratio, and that gene transmission through sons and daughters is symmetric so that any constant Mendelian transmission factors cancel in comparisons between the sexes.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions and well-tested facts, including (i) random mating implies that the average mating success of an individual of a given sex is inversely proportional to that sex’s frequency, and (ii) at an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) the marginal fitness return per unit investment is equalized across alternative investments, derive from first principles a condition for the resident population primary sex ratio by number, $p$, to be an ESS. Then, compute the ESS primary sex ratio by number when $c_m=2$ and $c_f=1$. Your final answer must be a single number. If you choose to approximate, round to four significant figures; otherwise, provide an exact value without approximation. Do not include units.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the condition for an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) for the primary sex ratio by number, denoted $p$, and for the computation of this ratio given specific costs for producing males and females. The analysis will be based on the principles of evolutionary game theory.\n\nA mother's evolutionary fitness is proportional to the total number of her grand-offspring. In a diploid, sexually reproducing population, every offspring results from the fusion of one male and one female gamete. Consequently, the total reproductive value of all males in a generation must equal the total reproductive value of all females in that generation. Let $N_m$ be the total number of males and $N_f$ be the total number of females in the population at reproductive age. Let the average reproductive value of a single male be $v_m$ and that of a single female be $v_f$. The equality of total reproductive values implies $N_m v_m = N_f v_f$. From this, we see that the reproductive value of an individual is inversely proportional to the frequency of its sex in the population, which is consistent with fact (i) from the problem statement. Specifically, $v_m \\propto \\frac{1}{N_m}$ and $v_f \\propto \\frac{1}{N_f}$.\n\nThe problem states that a mother has a fixed budget $B$ and allocates a fraction $x$ to sons and $1-x$ to daughters. The cost to produce one son is $c_m$, and the cost to produce one daughter is $c_f$. The number of sons a mother produces is $n_m = \\frac{xB}{c_m}$, and the number of daughters is $n_f = \\frac{(1-x)B}{c_f}$. Her fitness, $W$, is the sum of the reproductive values of her offspring:\n$$W = n_m v_m + n_f v_f = \\left(\\frac{xB}{c_m}\\right)v_m + \\left(\\frac{(1-x)B}{c_f}\\right)v_f$$\nThe values of $v_m$ and $v_f$ are determined by the population-wide sex ratio, which is set by the resident strategy, not the strategy of a single (potentially mutant) mother.\n\nAccording to fact (ii), an ESS is reached when the marginal fitness return per unit of investment is equalized across all possible investment choices. Here, the choices are investing in sons versus investing in daughters. The investment in sons is the budget portion $xB$, and the investment in daughters is $(1-x)B$.\n\nThe marginal fitness return from investing in sons is the derivative of the fitness component from sons, $n_m v_m$, with respect to the investment in sons, $I_m = xB$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial (n_m v_m)}{\\partial I_m} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (xB)} \\left(\\frac{xB}{c_m}v_m\\right) = \\frac{v_m}{c_m}$$\nSimilarly, the marginal fitness return from investing in daughters is the derivative of the fitness component from daughters, $n_f v_f$, with respect to the investment in daughters, $I_f = (1-x)B$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial (n_f v_f)}{\\partial I_f} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial ((1-x)B)} \\left(\\frac{(1-x)B}{c_f}v_f\\right) = \\frac{v_f}{c_f}$$\nAt the ESS, these marginal returns must be equal:\n$$\\frac{v_m}{c_m} = \\frac{v_f}{c_f}$$\nSubstituting the proportionality $v_m \\propto \\frac{1}{N_m}$ and $v_f \\propto \\frac{1}{N_f}$ (where the constant of proportionality is the same for both), we get:\n$$\\frac{1}{c_m N_m} = \\frac{1}{c_f N_f}$$\nThis simplifies to the central condition for an ESS population state, known as Fisher's principle:\n$$c_m N_m = c_f N_f$$\nThis condition states that at the ESS, the total parental investment in sons in the population must equal the total parental investment in daughters.\n\nThe problem asks for a condition on the primary sex ratio by number, $p$. By definition, $p = \\frac{N_m}{N_m + N_f}$, and the proportion of females is $1-p = \\frac{N_f}{N_m + N_f}$. We can express $N_m$ and $N_f$ in terms of $p$ and the total population size $N_{tot} = N_m + N_f$:\n$$N_m = p N_{tot}$$\n$$N_f = (1-p) N_{tot}$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the ESS condition $c_m N_m = c_f N_f$:\n$$c_m (p N_{tot}) = c_f ((1-p) N_{tot})$$\nSince $N_{tot}$ is non-zero, it can be cancelled from both sides, yielding the condition for the resident population primary sex ratio $p$ to be an ESS:\n$$c_m p = c_f (1-p)$$\nThis is the first part of the required derivation.\n\nTo compute the ESS primary sex ratio for the given costs, we solve this equation for $p$:\n$$c_m p = c_f - c_f p$$\n$$c_m p + c_f p = c_f$$\n$$p(c_m + c_f) = c_f$$\n$$p = \\frac{c_f}{c_m + c_f}$$\nThis is the general expression for the ESS primary sex ratio by number.\n\nThe problem provides the specific costs $c_m = 2$ and $c_f = 1$. Substituting these values into the expression for $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{1}{2 + 1} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThis is the ESS primary sex ratio by number. The population should be composed of one-third males and two-thirds females at conception. This result makes intuitive sense: because sons are twice as expensive to produce as daughters, the population stabilizes at a point where there are half as many sons as daughters, thereby equalizing the total parental investment in each sex. The answer is an exact rational number.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$$", "id": "2709671"}, {"introduction": "Evolutionary strategies are not always uniform across a population; sometimes the best strategy depends on an individual's own circumstances. The Trivers–Willard hypothesis proposes that a parent's physiological condition can influence whether it's better to produce a son or a daughter. This exercise presents a fascinating hypothetical species where, contrary to the most common examples, female reproductive success is more variable than male success [@problem_id:1963029]. By applying the Trivers–Willard logic to this reversed scenario, you will test your understanding of the core principle: parents in good condition should invest in the sex with the highest potential reproductive payoff.", "problem": "The Trivers–Willard hypothesis proposes that parents in good physiological condition should bias their offspring sex ratio towards the sex with higher reproductive variance, while parents in poor condition should favor the sex with lower reproductive variance.\n\nConsider a hypothetical species of deep-sea isopod, the Abyssal Brooder (*Bathynomus profundus*). This species exhibits a unique life history. Females are highly competitive and fight for control over nutrient-rich hydrothermal vent sites, which are essential for brooding offspring. A female who secures a prime vent site can produce a large clutch of well-nourished offspring, whereas a female who fails to secure a territory, or holds a poor-quality one, has drastically lower or even zero reproductive success. In contrast, males are non-territorial and rove between vent sites. While some males may achieve more matings than others, the variation in male reproductive success is significantly lower than the variation observed in females.\n\nBased on the Trivers–Willard hypothesis applied to this scenario, which of the following predictions is the most accurate?\n\nA. Females in good condition (holding prime territories) will produce a majority of daughters, while females in poor condition (without territories) will produce a majority of sons.\n\nB. Females in good condition (holding prime territories) will produce a majority of sons, while females in poor condition (without territories) will produce a majority of daughters.\n\nC. All females, regardless of their condition or territory status, will produce an equal ratio of sons and daughters to maintain the population's overall 1:1 sex ratio.\n\nD. Both high- and low-condition females will produce a majority of daughters, as this is the sex that directly utilizes the limited vent-site resources.\n\nE. The condition of the female will not affect the sex ratio of her offspring, but females in good condition will produce a larger total number of offspring.", "solution": "The Trivers–Willard hypothesis states that when parental condition positively affects the reproductive prospects of one sex more than the other, parents in good condition should bias investment toward the sex with the stronger positive response (i.e., higher variance and condition dependence), while parents in poor condition should bias investment toward the sex with lower variance and weaker condition dependence. Formally, let $c$ denote maternal condition and let $W_{s}(c)$ denote the expected reproductive success of an offspring of sex $s \\in \\{F,M\\}$ as a function of condition. If $\\frac{dW_{F}}{dc} > \\frac{dW_{M}}{dc}$ over relevant $c$, then as $c$ increases the optimal sex ratio shifts toward daughters; if the inequality reverses, it shifts toward sons.\n\nIn the Abyssal Brooder scenario, female reproductive success is highly variable and strongly condition-dependent because success hinges on securing a high-quality vent site, which enables production of large, well-nourished clutches; failure yields drastically reduced or zero success. In contrast, males are non-territorial and experience substantially lower variance in reproductive success, and male success is less dependent on maternal condition at birth. Therefore, the female function $W_{F}(c)$ is more condition-sensitive than $W_{M}(c)$, implying $\\frac{dW_{F}}{dc} > \\frac{dW_{M}}{dc}$ for relevant $c$.\n\nBy the Trivers–Willard prediction, high-condition females (e.g., those holding prime territories, large $c$) maximize expected grandchildren by producing relatively more daughters, who can capitalize on the high-condition environment to achieve large reproductive payoffs. Low-condition females (e.g., without territories, small $c$) maximize expected grandchildren by producing relatively more sons, whose reproductive success is less sensitive to poor condition and thus offers a more reliable return under low $c$.\n\nEvaluating the options, this matches option A: females in good condition will produce a majority of daughters, while females in poor condition will produce a majority of sons. Options B, D, and E contradict the condition-dependent bias predicted by the Trivers–Willard hypothesis, and option C incorrectly assumes that equal sex ratios must be produced by each female rather than emerging as a population-level outcome from differential strategies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1963029"}]}
