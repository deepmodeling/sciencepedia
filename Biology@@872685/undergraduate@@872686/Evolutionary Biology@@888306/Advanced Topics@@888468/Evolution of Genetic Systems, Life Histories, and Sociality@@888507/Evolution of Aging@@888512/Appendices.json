This exercise explores this fundamental concept using a hypothetical scenario involving two plant species with different lifespans. By comparing an annual plant that reproduces once and a perennial plant that reproduces for many seasons, you will analyze how the force of natural selection values early-life benefits versus late-life costs, a core principle of the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging [@problem_id:1923952].", "problem": "An ecologist studies two closely related species of flowering plants, Species A and Species B, that have colonized a stable, resource-rich island with very few herbivores or pathogens. Species A is an annual plant; it germinates, grows, reproduces once by producing seeds, and then dies within a single year. Species B is a perennial plant; it also reproduces via seeds each year but can live and reproduce for many successive years.\n\nA new mutation arises independently in both populations. This mutation is in a gene we will call `Gene-X`. The allele `X` of this gene has a pleiotropic effect: it significantly increases the number of seeds produced in the plant's first reproductive season, but it also accelerates cellular breakdown and tissue degradation (senescence) immediately following that first season.\n\nAssuming the mutation has arisen and all other environmental factors are equal for both species, which of the following outcomes is the most likely prediction based on the evolutionary theory of aging?\n\nA. The allele `X` will increase in frequency in the population of Species B (the perennial) but not in Species A (the annual).\n\nB. The allele `X` will be strongly selected against and eliminated from both populations because it causes accelerated senescence.\n\nC. The allele `X` will increase in frequency in the population of Species A (the annual) but not in Species B (the perennial).\n\nD. The allele `X` will increase in frequency in both populations because increased seed production always enhances fitness.\n\nE. The evolutionary fate of allele `X` cannot be predicted without knowing the exact percentage increase in seed production.", "solution": "We apply the evolutionary theory of aging via antagonistic pleiotropy and disposable soma: selection weights early-life reproduction more strongly than late-life survival, but the fitness effect of late costs depends critically on life history. For a semelparous annual (Species A), there is no reproduction after the first season; for an iteroparous perennial (Species B), future survival and reproduction contribute substantially to fitness, especially in a stable, low-extrinsic-mortality environment.\n\nLet expected lifetime reproductive success be the sum of expected seed outputs across years, discounted by survival between years. Denote first-year seed production by $f_{1}$ and subsequent-year seed outputs by $f_{2}, f_{3}, \\dots$, and let adult survival between consecutive years be $s$.\n\nFor Species A (annual, semelparous), by definition $s = 0$, so the baseline fitness is\n$$\nW_{A,0} = f_{1}.\n$$\nThe allele $X$ increases first-year seed production by $\\Delta f > 0$, and its post-first-season senescence is irrelevant because the annual has no reproduction after the first season anyway. Thus\n$$\nW_{A,X} = f_{1} + \\Delta f > W_{A,0},\n$$\nso allele $X$ is favored and will increase in frequency in Species A.\n\nFor Species B (perennial, iteroparous), with low extrinsic mortality on a stable, resource-rich island, $s > 0$ is expected to be relatively high, so the baseline fitness is\n$$\nW_{B,0} = f_{1} + s f_{2} + s^{2} f_{3} + \\dots.\n$$\nWith allele $X$, first-year output becomes $f_{1}' = f_{1} + \\Delta f$, but accelerated senescence immediately after the first season reduces survival and/or future fecundity. In an extreme but illustrative case where post-first-season survival is nearly eliminated by senescence, $s' \\approx 0$, the mutant’s fitness is approximately\n$$\nW_{B,X} \\approx f_{1} + \\Delta f.\n$$\nAllele $X$ would then be favored only if\n$$\nf_{1} + \\Delta f > f_{1} + s f_{2} + s^{2} f_{3} + \\dots \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad \\Delta f > s f_{2} + s^{2} f_{3} + \\dots.\n$$\nGiven high $s$ and positive $f_{i}$ values in this environment, the right-hand side is typically large; hence, the inequality is unlikely to hold. Even if senescence is partial (so that $s'$ and/or $f_{i}'$ are reduced rather than eliminated), the reduction in future terms still tends to make $W_{B,X}  W_{B,0}$. Therefore, allele $X$ will generally be selected against in Species B.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is that allele $X$ will increase in frequency in Species A but not in Species B, matching option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1923952"}, {"introduction": "Having established the conceptual basis of life history trade-offs, we can now quantify them to predict evolutionary outcomes.

By calculating the net reproductive rate, $R_0$, you will directly measure the Darwinian fitness of different alleles and determine which is favored by selection.", "problem": "In a hypothetical population of vertebrates, the intensity of the immune inflammatory response is controlled by a single gene locus with two alleles: `H` and `L`. The `H` allele leads to a high-inflammatory response, while the `L` allele codes for a low-inflammatory response.

Fitness is determined by lifetime reproductive output. The key life history parameters for each genotype are defined as follows:\n\n-   **Genotypes and Phenotypes**: The `H` allele's early-life benefit is dominant, while its late-life cost is additive (or shows incomplete dominance).\n    -   `HH` and `HL` genotypes exhibit a robust, high-inflammatory response.\n    -   `LL` genotype exhibits a weaker, low-inflammatory response.\n\n-   **Early-life Selection (Survival to Age 1)**: The population is exposed to a virulent pathogen during juvenile development. The high-inflammatory response provides a significant survival advantage.\n    -   The probability of an individual with the `LL` genotype surviving from birth to age 1 is $p_{0,LL} = 0.50$.\n    -   The probability of an individual with the `HH` or `HL` genotype surviving from birth to age 1 is $p_{0,H*} = 0.90$.\n\n-   **Late-life Selection (Survival from Age 1 to Age 2)**: The high-inflammatory response causes chronic, low-grade systemic inflammation (a phenomenon known as \"inflammaging\"), which accelerates senescence and reduces lifespan.\n    -   The probability of an `LL` individual surviving from age 1 to age 2 is $p_{1,LL} = 0.90$.\n    -   The probability of an `HH` individual surviving from age 1 to age 2 is $p_{1,HH} = 0.30$.\n    -   The `HL` heterozygote experiences an intermediate cost, with its survival probability from age 1 to age 2 being the arithmetic mean of the two homozygotes.\n\n-   **Fecundity**: Fecundity is constant for any individual that survives to a given reproductive age, regardless of genotype.\n    -   An individual reproducing at age 1 has $m_1 = 5$ offspring.\n    -   An individual reproducing at age 2 has $m_2 = 3$ offspring.\n\nThe lifetime reproductive success of a genotype is quantified by its net reproductive rate, $R_0$, which is the sum of the expected number of offspring produced at each age class. For this life cycle, it is given by $R_0 = p_0 m_1 + p_0 p_1 m_2$, where $p_0$ is the survival probability to age 1, and $p_1$ is the conditional survival probability from age 1 to age 2.\n\nCalculate the Darwinian fitness of the heterozygote (`HL`) relative to the `LL` homozygote.
