In the classic model, an asexual lineage composed entirely of females grows twice as fast as a sexual lineage where half the individuals are non-egg-laying males. This model, however, assumes males contribute nothing to offspring survival.\n\nConsider a hypothetical animal species where we can compare an asexual (parthenogenetic) lineage and a sexual lineage.\n1. In the asexual lineage, females are the only sex. A single mother provides all parental care. The probability of an offspring surviving from birth to reproductive maturity under this maternal-only care is $P_A$.\n2. In the sexual lineage, the population maintains a 1:1 sex ratio. Males in this lineage provide extensive parental care alongside the females. This biparental care is so effective that the probability of an offspring surviving from birth to reproductive maturity is $P_S$.\n\nIn all other respects, the lineages are identical: females in both populations produce the same number of eggs per clutch, and the resource costs of producing an individual egg are the same.\n\nIf the survival probability with maternal care alone is $P_A = 0.55$ and the survival probability with biparental care is $P_S = 0.95$, calculate the effective reproductive cost for the sexual lineage. This cost is defined as the ratio of the asexual lineage's per-capita growth rate to the sexual lineage's per-capita growth rate.\n\nRound your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $E$ be the number of eggs produced per female per reproductive episode (identical in both lineages).\n\nAsexual lineage:\n- All adults are females, and only mothers provide care.\n- The expected number of offspring reaching reproductive maturity per adult (per-capita growth rate) is\n$$\nr_{A} = E P_{A}.\n$$\n\nSexual lineage:\n- The sex ratio is $1:1$, so in a population of $N$ adults, there are $N/2$ females.\n- Each female produces $E$ eggs and biparental care yields survival probability $P_{S}$.\n- The total number of offspring reaching maturity is $(N/2) E P_{S}$, so the per-capita growth rate is\n$$\nr_{S} = \\frac{(N/2) E P_{S}}{N} = \\frac{1}{2} E P_{S}.\n$$\n\nThe effective reproductive cost of sex, defined as the ratio of asexual to sexual per-capita growth, is\n$$\nC \\equiv \\frac{r_{A}}{r_{S}} = \\frac{E P_{A}}{(1/2) E P_{S}} = \\frac{2 P_{A}}{P_{S}}.\n$$\nSubstituting $P_{A} = 0.55$ and $P_{S} = 0.95$,\n$$\nC = \\frac{2 \\times 0.55}{0.95} = \\frac{1.10}{0.95} \\approx 1.157894\\ldots\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $1.16$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.16}$$", "id": "1925328"}, {"introduction": "Having established that the cost of sex can be mitigated, we now turn to its advantages. One of the most significant benefits of recombination is its ability to separate beneficial mutations from linked deleterious alleles, a phenomenon sometimes called \"genetic hitchhiking\" in reverse. This practice explores a hypothetical scenario that clearly illustrates how recombination can \"rescue\" a favorable new allele from the bad genetic neighborhood in which it arose, allowing natural selection to act more efficiently [@problem_id:1925374].", "problem": "Consider a large population of a vegetatively haploid fungus that primarily reproduces asexually. The wild-type population is sensitive to a newly introduced antifungal agent. Within this population, a single, strongly beneficial point mutation, allele `R`, arises at the `resistance` locus, conferring complete resistance to the agent. By chance, this mutation occurs on a chromosome that also carries a distinct, pre-existing, weakly deleterious mutation, allele `d`, at the `dubious` locus. The `dubious` locus is physically close to the `resistance` locus on the same chromosome. The original, non-deleterious allele at this locus is `D`. Therefore, the first resistant individual has the haplotype `Rd`.\n\nThe vast majority of the fungal population has the wild-type haplotype `rD` (sensitive to the agent, no deleterious `d` allele). While primarily asexual, this fungal species can engage in a rare sexual cycle where two haploid individuals fuse to form a transient diploid cell, which then immediately undergoes meiosis to produce new haploid spores. This process allows for genetic recombination between homologous chromosomes.\n\nIn the presence of the antifungal agent, which of the following statements best describes the primary advantage that genetic recombination provides for the spread of the beneficial `R` allele in this specific scenario?\n\nA. Recombination increases the overall mutation rate, generating new beneficial alleles faster than asexual reproduction.\n\nB. Recombination allows the population to purge the deleterious `d` allele by creating homozygous `dd` diploid individuals that are quickly eliminated by selection.\n\nC. Recombination allows for the creation of a new `RD` haplotype, which has a higher fitness than the original `Rd` haplotype and can therefore spread more rapidly through the population.\n\nD. Recombination allows the deleterious effects of the `d` allele to be masked by the `D` allele in the transient diploid state, preventing the `R` allele from being eliminated.\n\nE. Recombination reverses the effects of Muller's Ratchet by recreating chromosomes that have fewer deleterious mutations than the fittest individuals in the population.", "solution": "Define two linked loci on the same chromosome: the resistance locus with alleles $R$ (resistant) and $r$ (sensitive), and the dubious locus with alleles $D$ (non-deleterious) and $d$ (deleterious).

On a broader, population-wide scale, sex acts as a constant engine for shuffling genes and breaking down non-random associations between alleles at different loci, a state known as linkage disequilibrium. This exercise provides a mathematical model to quantify how the rate of sexual reproduction directly governs the decay of these associations over generations, solidifying your understanding of sex as a fundamental force for creating genetic variation [@problem_id:1925330].", "problem": "In a large population of a certain species of facultatively sexual organism, individuals can reproduce either asexually (clonally) or sexually. Consider two gene loci, Locus 1 and Locus 2, located on the same chromosome. The recombination rate between these two loci during meiosis is $r$. The population is characterized by a parameter $\\sigma$, which represents the fraction of the population that reproduces sexually in each generation. The remaining fraction, $(1-\\sigma)$, reproduces asexually.

Let $D_t$ be the linkage disequilibrium in the population at generation $t$. We want to find an expression for $D_{t+1}$ in terms of $D_t$.\n\nThe population in generation $t+1$ is formed from two distinct groups of offspring: those produced asexually and those produced sexually.\n\nFirst, consider the fraction $(1-\\sigma)$ of the population that reproduces asexually. Asexual reproduction is clonal, meaning offspring are genetically identical to their parent. Therefore, the haplotypes are passed down without modification. In this sub-population of offspring, the linkage disequilibrium remains unchanged from the parental generation. The contribution to the total linkage disequilibrium from this group is $(1-\\sigma) D_t$.\n\nSecond, consider the fraction $\\sigma$ of the population that reproduces sexually. In this subgroup, individuals undergo meiosis to produce gametes. Recombination can occur between the two loci with a probability $r$. The standard result for a fully sexual population is that linkage disequilibrium decreases by a factor of $(1-r)$ in each generation. Specifically, if the parental linkage disequilibrium is $D_t$, the linkage disequilibrium among the gametes produced by this sexually reproducing group will be $D_t(1-r)$. These gametes then combine randomly to form the sexually produced offspring, and the linkage disequilibrium among these offspring will also be $D_t(1-r)$. Therefore, the contribution to the total linkage disequilibrium from this sexually-produced group is $\\sigma D_t(1-r)$.\n\nThe total linkage disequilibrium in the next generation, $D_{t+1}$, is the weighted average of the disequilibrium from the asexually and sexually produced offspring.\n$$D_{t+1} = (1-\\sigma) D_t + \\sigma [D_t(1-r)]$$\n\nWe can factor out $D_t$ from the expression:\n$$D_{t+1} = D_t [(1-\\sigma) + \\sigma(1-r)]$$\n\nNow, we simplify the term inside the brackets:\n$$D_{t+1} = D_t [1 - \\sigma + \\sigma - \\sigma r]$$\n$$D_{t+1} = D_t [1 - \\sigma r]$$\n\nThis equation gives the recursive relationship for the change in linkage disequilibrium over one generation. To find the linkage disequilibrium after $t$ generations, we can apply this relationship iteratively, starting with $D_0$.\n\nFor $t=1$:\n$$D_1 = D_0(1 - \\sigma r)$$\nFor $t=2$:\n$$D_2 = D_1(1 - \\sigma r) = [D_0(1 - \\sigma r)](1 - \\sigma r) = D_0(1 - \\sigma r)^2$$\nFor a general generation $t$:\n$$D_t = D_0(1 - \\sigma r)^t$$\n\nThis expression shows that the decay of linkage disequilibrium depends not only on the recombination rate $r$ but also on the effective rate of recombination in the population, which is moderated by the fraction of individuals participating in sexual reproduction, $\\sigma$. The term $\\sigma r$ can be interpreted as the effective recombination rate at the population level.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA. $D_t = D_0 (1-r)^{t}$ is the formula for a fully sexual population ($\\sigma=1$).\nB. $D_t = D_0 (1-\\sigma r)^{t}$ matches our derived formula.\nC. $D_t = D_0 (1-r)^{\\sigma t}$ is mathematically incorrect.\nD. $D_t = D_0 (\\sigma (1-r))^{t}$ is mathematically incorrect.\nE. $D_t = D_0 ((1-\\sigma) + \\sigma r)^{t}$ is mathematically incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression is given by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1925330"}]}
