This gene has two alleles: a dominant allele $G$, which when expressed causes a 'Giant' phenotype, and a recessive allele $g$, which results in a 'Normal-sized' phenotype. The expression of this gene is governed by genomic imprinting, a phenomenon where the expression of an allele is dependent on its parental origin. For this particular gene, only the allele inherited from the father (the paternal allele) is expressed; the allele inherited from the mother (the maternal allele) is completely silenced, regardless of whether it is dominant or recessive.\n\nConsider two true-breeding lines of these marsupials: one line consists entirely of homozygous Giant individuals ($GG$) and the other consists entirely of homozygous Normal-sized individuals ($gg$). Two reciprocal crosses are set up:\n\n- **Cross 1:** A Giant male from the true-breeding Giant line is mated with a Normal-sized female from the true-breeding Normal-sized line.\n- **Cross 2:** A Normal-sized male from the true-breeding Normal-sized line is mated with a Giant female from the true-breeding Giant line.\n\nWhich of the following options accurately predicts the phenotypes of all offspring in the F1 generation resulting from these two crosses?\n\nA.

The problem states that only the paternally-inherited allele for the size gene is expressed, while the maternally-inherited allele is silenced.

Therefore, all sperm he produces will carry the allele $G$. This will be the paternal allele in the offspring.\n- **Gametes from the female:** The female has a genotype of $gg$. Therefore, all eggs she produces will carry the allele $g$.

According to the imprinting rule, only the paternal allele is expressed. The expression of the paternal $G$ allele causes the 'Giant' phenotype.

According to the imprinting rule, only the paternal allele is expressed. The expression of the paternal $g$ allele leads to the 'Normal-sized' phenotype. The maternal $G$ allele, despite being dominant, is silenced and has no effect on the phenotype.\n- **Conclusion for Cross 2:** All offspring from Cross 2 will be Normal-sized.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:**\n- F1 generation from Cross 1: All Giant.\n- F1 generation from Cross 2: All Normal-sized.\n\nThis outcome demonstrates a classic non-Mendelian inheritance pattern where reciprocal crosses yield different results.

In this scenario, we explore how paternal imprinting—the silencing of the allele from the father—can determine offspring viability when a recessive lethal allele is involved. This practice will sharpen your ability to calculate survival probabilities under these non-Mendelian rules [@problem_id:1935197].", "problem": "In a species of bioluminescent fungus, a gene called *Luminase* is essential for embryonic development. There are two alleles for this gene: a functional wild-type allele, $L$, and a non-functional, recessive lethal allele, $l$. This gene is subject to genomic imprinting. Specifically, the paternal copy of the *Luminase* gene is always methylated and silenced, meaning only the allele inherited from the maternal parent is expressed in the offspring. Therefore, the allele $l$ is lethal only when inherited from the mother. Heterozygous individuals ($Ll$) are phenotypically normal and fully viable.\n\nConsider two reciprocal crosses:\n\n**Cross 1:** A heterozygous ($Ll$) female is crossed with a wild-type homozygous ($LL$) male.\n**Cross 2:** A wild-type homozygous ($LL$) female is crossed with a heterozygous ($Ll$) male.\n\nWhat are the expected proportions of viable offspring produced from Cross 1 and Cross 2, respectively?\n\nA. 1/2 and 1\n\nB. 1 and 1/2\n\nC. 1/2 and 1/2\n\nD. 3/4 and 1\n\nE. 1 and 3/4\n\nF. 3/4 and 3/4", "solution": "Genomic imprinting here silences the paternal allele; thus only the maternal allele is expressed.

This final practice challenges you to trace an imprinted trait through a family tree, requiring careful deduction of genotypes based on phenotypes and parent-of-origin effects. It also introduces the critical concept of imprint erasure and re-establishment during gametogenesis, where an individual's sex determines the epigenetic marks they pass on to their children [@problem_id:1935227].", "problem": "In a hypothetical species of primate, *Nocturnus argenteus*, a non-sex-linked condition known as Silver-Back Sheen (SBS) causes a distinct silver shimmer on the fur of an individual's back. The inheritance of SBS is governed by a single gene with two alleles: a dominant allele $S$ which causes the condition, and a recessive allele $s$ for normal fur.\n\nThe expression of this gene is subject to genomic imprinting. The $S$ allele is only expressed phenotypically if it is inherited from the father. If an individual inherits the $S$ allele from their mother, the allele is silenced, and the individual will appear normal (unaffected by SBS), unless they also inherit an active $S$ allele from their father.\n\nConsider the following lineage: An initial pairing occurs between a male who has SBS and a female who does not. The affected male's own mother was unaffected. The unaffected female partner comes from a long lineage where no individuals have ever shown SBS. This pair produces an unaffected daughter.\n\nThis unaffected daughter later mates with an unaffected male. This male's father had SBS, but his mother did not. A genetic analysis of this unaffected male confirms that he is heterozygous, carrying one copy of the $S$ allele.\n\nAssuming Mendelian segregation and the described imprinting pattern, what is the probability that the first child of this final pairing (the unaffected daughter and the heterozygous unaffected male) will have Silver-Back Sheen? Express your answer as an exact fraction.", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability that a child will have Silver-Back Sheen (SBS), a condition caused by a paternally expressed dominant allele $S$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the genotypes of the final pairing: the unaffected daughter and the heterozygous unaffected male.\n\nLet's analyze the daughter's parents. Her father had SBS, and his own mother was unaffected. For the father to have SBS, he must carry at least one $S$ allele, and it must have come from his father (since his mother was unaffected and thus could not have passed on an active $S$ allele). Her mother was unaffected and from a lineage with no history of SBS, so we can assume her genotype is homozygous recessive, $ss$. The father and mother produced an unaffected daughter. For the daughter to be unaffected, she cannot have a paternally-inherited $S$ allele. Since her mother is $ss$, the daughter must receive an $s$ allele from her mother. To be unaffected, she must have also received an $s$ allele from her father. Therefore, the father's genotype must be $Ss$, and the unaffected daughter's genotype is $ss$.\n\nNext, let's analyze the male in the final pairing. The problem states he is unaffected but also that he is a heterozygous carrier of the $S$ allele. An individual can be heterozygous ($Ss$) and unaffected only if the $S$ allele they carry is silenced. According to the imprinting rule, the $S$ allele is silenced when inherited from the mother. This is consistent with his family history: his father had SBS (and thus passed on an active allele to any offspring who got it), but he is unaffected, meaning he must have inherited the $s$ allele from his father. He inherited his $S$ allele from his mother. Therefore, the unaffected male's genotype is $Ss$, with the $S$ allele being of maternal origin.\n\nNow we have the final pairing:\n- The female (the unaffected daughter) has a genotype of $ss$.\n- The male (the heterozygous unaffected male) has a genotype of $Ss$.\n\nWe need to find the probability of their child having SBS. A child will have SBS only if it inherits an $S$ allele from its father.\n\nLet's consider the gametes produced by each parent.\nThe female ($ss$) will produce only one type of egg, containing the $s$ allele. The probability of producing an $s$ egg is 1.\n\nThe male ($Ss$) will undergo gametogenesis. During this process, the existing imprints on his alleles are erased and re-established according to his own sex (male). This means the $S$ allele he carries, although silenced in his somatic cells because it came from his mother, will become active in his sperm. He will produce two types of sperm in equal proportions (by Mendelian segregation):\n- Sperm containing the $S$ allele (which is now paternally imprinted and thus active). Probability = $1/2$.\n- Sperm containing the $s$ allele. Probability = $1/2$.\n\nNow, let's determine the possible genotypes and corresponding phenotypes of the offspring. The child will inherit an $s$ allele from the mother with certainty.\n\n- **Case 1**: The child inherits the $S$ allele from the father.\nThe genotype will be $Ss$. Since the $S$ allele is inherited from the father, it will be expressed, and the child will have Silver-Back Sheen (SBS). The probability of this event is the probability of the father producing an $S$-carrying sperm, which is $1/2$.\n\n- **Case 2**: The child inherits the $s$ allele from the father.\nThe genotype will be $ss$. The child will be unaffected by SBS. The probability of this event is the probability of the father producing an $s$-carrying sperm, which is $1/2$.\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the child will have Silver-Back Sheen. This corresponds to Case 1.\n\nTherefore, the probability is $1/2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "1935227"}]}
