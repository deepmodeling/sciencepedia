Let's break down the process of finding the correct complementary strand step-by-step and then analyze Charles's mistake.\n\nThe original template strand is given as 5'-GCAATTCGGT-3'.\n\n**Step 1: Apply Complementary Base Pairing**\nThe first principle of DNA double helix formation is complementary base pairing. Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T), and Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C). We apply this rule to each base in the template strand to find the sequence of bases on the complementary strand.\n- G pairs with C\n- C pairs with G\n- A pairs with T\n- A pairs with T\n- T pairs with A\n- T pairs with A\n- C pairs with G\n- G pairs with C\n- G pairs with C\n- T pairs with A\n\nFollowing the template strand from the 5' end, the sequence of complementary bases is: C, G, T, T, A, A, G, C, C, A. So the sequence of the complementary strand is CGTTAAGCCA. This is the sequence that Charles correctly identified.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Antiparallel Principle**\nThe second fundamental principle of the DNA double helix structure is that the two strands are **antiparallel**. This means that they run in opposite directions. If the template strand has a 5' to 3' polarity, its complementary strand must have a 3' to 5' polarity.\n\nSo, by aligning the complementary bases against the template strand, we get the correctly oriented complementary strand:\n\nTemplate:     5'-GCAATTCGGT-3'\nComplement:   3'-CGTTAAGCCA-5'\n\nThis, 3'-CGTTAAGCCA-5', is the correct, full description of the complementary strand.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Charles's Answer and Identify the Error**\nCharles's proposed answer is 5'-CGTTAAGCCA-3'.\n- He correctly identified the base sequence: CGTTAAGCCA.\n- However, he assigned it a 5' to 3' orientation.\n\nThis implies a structure where both strands run in the same direction:\nTemplate:     5'-GCAATTCGGT-3'\nCharles's ans:  5'-CGTTAAGCCA-3'  (Incorrect: implies parallel strands)\n\nThis proposed structure is **parallel**, not **antiparallel**. The fundamental principle that Charles failed to apply is that the two strands of a DNA double helix are antiparallel.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Multiple-Choice Options**\n- A. The phosphodiester bonds linking the nucleotides can only form in the 3' to 5' direction. This is incorrect. DNA polymerase synthesizes DNA by adding nucleotides to the 3' end, so the strand grows in the 5' to 3' direction. This statement is factually wrong and doesn't directly address the orientation error.\n- B. One strand of a DNA molecule contains only purines, while the complementary strand contains only pyrimidines. This is incorrect. The given template strand 5'-GCAATTCGGT-3' contains both purines (G, A) and pyrimidines (C, T).\n- C. The two strands of a DNA double helix are antiparallel, meaning their 5' to 3' orientations run in opposite directions. This statement correctly describes the principle that Charles overlooked. His answer implicitly assumes a parallel structure, demonstrating a failure to apply the antiparallel rule.\n- D. The hydrogen bonds between Guanine and Cytosine are stronger than those between Adenine and Thymine, causing the strand to twist. While it is true that G-C pairs have three hydrogen bonds and A-T pairs have two, this fact relates to the stability and melting temperature of DNA, not the relative orientation or directionality of the two strands.\n- E. The complementary strand must be an exact copy of the template strand, but with Uracil replacing Thymine. This describes the process of transcription into RNA, not DNA replication. It is fundamentally incorrect for forming a DNA double helix.\n\nTherefore, the statement that best identifies the principle Charles failed to apply is C. He correctly found the complementary bases but failed to reverse the orientation of the strand to make it antiparallel to the template.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1526600"}, {"introduction": "The strict A-T and G-C pairing rules have a direct quantitative consequence, first observed by Erwin Chargaff.

Further analysis indicates that the number of adenine bases is 30% of the number of guanine bases within this fragment.\n\nFor Fragment Beta, it is determined that its cytosine content is 40% of the total bases in the fragment.\n\nBased on the principles of DNA structure, calculate the ratio of the total percentage of adenine-thymine base pairs in Fragment Alpha to the total percentage of adenine-thymine base pairs in Fragment Beta.

The key condition is that adenine is 30% ($3/10$) of guanine, so:\n$$\nA = \\frac{3}{10}G\n$$\nFrom Chargaff's rules, we also know $T=A$ and $C=G$.

The double helix is not just a static ladder; it is a twisted structure where the rotational position of base pairs is critical for biological processes like gene regulation. This final problem [@problem_id:1526597] requires you to think about DNA as a physical object, calculating how inserting base pairs can rotationally reorient protein-binding sites on the helical surface.", "problem": "In a simplified model of gene regulation, two specific protein-binding sites, Site A and Site B, are located on a long strand of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). For two proteins bound at these sites to interact optimally, their binding sites must be rotationally aligned on the same face of the DNA double helix. In our scenario, Site A and Site B are initially separated by a DNA sequence that places them in such an optimal, same-face alignment.\n\nA molecular biologist aims to disrupt this protein-protein interaction by inserting a new, non-coding DNA sequence between Site A and Site B. The goal is to reorient Site B so that it lies on the opposite face of the DNA helix relative to Site A.\n\nAssume the DNA is in the standard B-conformation, which has a helical repeat of 10.5 base pairs per full 360-degree turn.

Each inserted base pair advances the helical phase by an angle of $\\frac{360^\\circ}{10.5}$ or $\\frac{1}{H}=\\frac{2}{21}$ of a full turn. Inserting $N$ base pairs changes the relative phase by:\n$$\n\\Delta\\phi = \\frac{N}{H}=\\frac{2N}{21} \\quad (\\text{in units of turns})\n$$\nWe want to place Site B on the opposite face relative to Site A, which corresponds to a rotation of 180 degrees, or half a turn. Thus, we want the phase change $\\Delta\\phi$ to be as close as possible to $\\frac{1}{2}$ turn, or more generally, $m + \\frac{1}{2}$ turns for any integer $m$. We need to find the smallest positive integer $N$ that minimizes the quantity:\n$$\n\\min_{m\\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\left|\\frac{2N}{21}-\\left(m+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right|\n$$\nTo work with integers, we can multiply the expression inside the absolute value by $42$:\n$$\n\\min_{m\\in \\mathbb{Z}} |4N-42(m+1/2)| = \\min_{m\\in \\mathbb{Z}} |4N-42m-21|\n$$\nAn exact 180-degree opposition would require this value to be zero, i.e., $4N - 42m - 21 = 0$, which implies $4N = 42m + 21$. This is impossible for integers $N$ and $m$ because the left-hand side ($4N$) is even, while the right-hand side ($42m+21$) is always odd.\n\nTherefore, we must find the smallest possible non-zero integer value for $|4N - 42m - 21|$. Since the expression is an integer, the smallest possible magnitude is $1$. This occurs when:\n$$\n4N - 42m - 21 = \\pm 1\n$$\nThis gives us two cases, expressed as congruences modulo 42:\n1. $4N \\equiv 21+1 \\pmod{42} \\implies 4N \\equiv 22 \\pmod{42}$\n2. $4N \\equiv 21-1 \\pmod{42} \\implies 4N \\equiv 20 \\pmod{42}$\n\nLet's solve these for the smallest positive integer $N$:\n\nCase 1: $4N \\equiv 22 \\pmod{42}$. Dividing by 2 gives $2N \\equiv 11 \\pmod{21}$. To solve for $N$, we multiply by the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 21. Since $2 \\times 11 = 22 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{21}$, the inverse is 11.\n$$ N \\equiv 11 \\times 11 \\pmod{21} \\implies N \\equiv 121 \\pmod{21} $$\nSince $121 = 5 \\times 21 + 16$, we have $N \\equiv 16 \\pmod{21}$. The smallest positive solution is $N=16$.\n\nCase 2: $4N \\equiv 20 \\pmod{42}$.
