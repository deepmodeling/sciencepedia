Standard Watson-Crick pairing implies Chargaff’s rules: $p_{A} = p_{T}$ and $p_{G} = p_{C}$. The fractions must sum to unity:\n$$\np_{A} + p_{T} + p_{G} + p_{C} = 1.\n$$\nGiven $p_{C} = 0.220$, we have $p_{G} = p_{C} = 0.220$.

This bacterium is subjected to a two-stage experiment.\n\nIn the first stage, the bacterium is cultured for exactly one generation in a medium containing a mutagenic agent, 5-bromouracil (5-BU). The agent 5-BU is a base analog of thymine (T), and in its most common stable form (keto form), it pairs with adenine (A) during DNA replication.\n\nIn the second stage, the two cells resulting from the first division are immediately transferred to a new medium that is completely free of 5-BU. They are then allowed to grow for exactly one more generation. It is known that if a 5-BU base has been incorporated into a DNA strand, it has a significant probability of temporarily shifting to its rare, unstable tautomeric form (enol form) when it serves as a template in the next replication round. In this enol form, 5-BU preferentially pairs with guanine (G).\n\nAssuming that the 5-BU is incorporated into a new DNA strand during the first replication round and the subsequent mispairing event occurs during the second replication round, what will be the composition of the base pairs at this specific locus across the four granddaughter DNA molecules?\n\nA.

This produces one daughter duplex containing an A-5BU pair.\n- The complementary parental strand with template T directs incorporation of A, producing the other daughter duplex containing a normal A-T pair.\nThus, after the first generation, there are two duplexes: one with A-5BU and one with A-T.\n3) Second replication (in 5-BU-free medium), allowing mispairing from the incorporated 5-BU:\n- Replication of the A-5BU duplex yields two granddaughter duplexes:\n  a) The parental A strand templates a new T, yielding a granddaughter duplex with an A-T pair.\n  b) The parental strand containing 5-BU now serves as a template; by the stated assumption, it undergoes the tautomeric shift to the enol form during templating and pairs with G. This yields a granddaughter duplex with a G-5BU pair at the locus.\n- Replication of the A-T duplex yields two granddaughter duplexes, both with normal A-T pairs, since there is no 5-BU present and no mispairing is specified.\n\nTally across the four granddaughter DNA molecules: three duplexes with A-T pairs and one duplex with a G-5BU pair.
