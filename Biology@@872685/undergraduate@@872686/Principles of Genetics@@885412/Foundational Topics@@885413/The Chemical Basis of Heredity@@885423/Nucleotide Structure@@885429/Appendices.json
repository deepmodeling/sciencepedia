A DNA molecule is a double helix composed of two polynucleotide chains that are complementary to each other. The building blocks of these chains are nucleotides, each containing one of four nitrogenous bases: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T). The complementarity is governed by specific base-pairing rules: Adenine pairs with Thymine, and Guanine pairs with Cytosine. Furthermore, the two strands are antiparallel, meaning they run in opposite directions. The orientation of a strand is indicated by its 5' (five prime) and 3' (three prime) ends.\n\nConsider a short, single-stranded DNA sequence that is a fragment of a gene's coding region, given as:\n`5'-ATGCAG-3'`\n\nWhich of the following options correctly represents the sequence and orientation of the complementary DNA strand?\n\nA. 3'-UACGUC-5'\n\nB. 5'-TACGTC-3'\n\nC. 3'-TACGTC-5'\n\nD. 3'-GCATGA-5'\n\nE. 5'-GCATGA-3'", "solution": "We use the DNA base-pairing rules (A pairs with T, and G pairs with C) and the fact that the two strands are antiparallel, meaning the complementary strand runs in the opposite orientation: the $5'$ end of one strand aligns with the $3'$ end of the other.\n\nStarting from the given strand 5'-ATGCAG-3', we determine the complementary bases for each position:\nA pairs with T, T pairs with A, G pairs with C, C pairs with G, A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. This yields the complementary sequence of bases TACGTC.\n\nBecause the strands are antiparallel, the complementary strand must be written from its $3'$ end opposite the given strand’s $5'$ end. Therefore, the correct complementary strand with proper orientation is 3'-TACGTC-5'.\n\nOption A is invalid because it uses U (uracil), which is found in RNA, not DNA. Option B presents the correct base sequence but in the wrong (parallel) orientation. Options D and E have incorrect base sequences.

Although this nucleotide still possesses 3'-OH and 5'-OH groups, the backbone immediately adjacent to the terminus now contains a 3'-2' linkage rather than the canonical 3'-5' linkage. DNA polymerases are structurally and catalytically optimized to bind a primer-template junction that presents a terminal 3'-OH preceded by a 3'-5' phosphodiester linkage, which correctly positions the 3'-OH for further in-line attack on the alpha phosphate of the next incoming nucleotide.
