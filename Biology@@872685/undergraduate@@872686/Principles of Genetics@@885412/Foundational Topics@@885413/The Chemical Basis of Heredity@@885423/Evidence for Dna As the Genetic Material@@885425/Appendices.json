{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "In the early days of genetics, scientists faced a fundamental question: which molecule carries the blueprint of life? Based on what was known at the time, proteins, with their 20 different amino acid building blocks, seemed far more capable of encoding complex biological information than the seemingly simple DNA, which has only four nucleotide bases. This exercise [@problem_id:2315433] allows you to quantify this \"complexity argument\" and appreciate the reasoning that initially favored proteins as the genetic material.", "problem": "In the early 20th century, before the seminal work of Hershey and Chase, the scientific community widely believed that proteins, not Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA), were the carriers of genetic information. This belief was partly based on a simple argument about structural complexity and information-carrying capacity. Proteins are constructed from a set of 20 standard amino acids, whereas DNA is built from only 4 nucleotide bases (Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, and Thymine).\n\nConsider a short macromolecule of length $n=4$ units. Let $N_{protein}$ be the total number of unique sequences possible for a polypeptide of this length, and let $N_{DNA}$ be the total number of unique sequences for a DNA strand of the same length. To quantify the difference in potential information content that influenced early researchers, calculate the value of the ratio $\\frac{N_{protein}}{N_{DNA}}$. Assume that any of the constituent units (amino acids or bases) can appear at any position along the chain.", "solution": "We model a sequence of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $a$ using the rule of product (fundamental counting principle): each position has $a$ independent choices, so the total number of unique sequences is $a^{n}$.\n\nFor a polypeptide of length $n=4$ with $a=20$ possible amino acids at each position, the number of unique sequences is\n$$\nN_{protein} = 20^{4}.\n$$\nFor a DNA strand of length $n=4$ with $a=4$ possible nucleotide bases at each position, the number of unique sequences is\n$$\nN_{DNA} = 4^{4}.\n$$\nThe ratio of the numbers of sequences is\n$$\n\\frac{N_{protein}}{N_{DNA}} = \\frac{20^{4}}{4^{4}} = \\left(\\frac{20}{4}\\right)^{4} = 5^{4} = 625.\n$$\nThus, for length $4$, proteins have $625$ times as many possible sequences as DNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{625}$$", "id": "2315433"}, {"introduction": "While the debate over proteins and DNA continued, key insights into DNA's chemical nature were emerging. Erwin Chargaff's meticulous analysis revealed a stunningly simple but profound pattern in the composition of DNA: the amount of adenine ($A$) always equals that of thymine ($T$), and the amount of guanine ($G$) always equals that of cytosine ($C$). This practice [@problem_id:2315420] gives you hands-on experience applying these foundational rules, which were essential for disproving the idea of DNA as a simple, repetitive polymer and were a critical clue for the double-helix model.", "problem": "A team of biochemists is sequencing the genome of a newly isolated bacterial species. They determine that the genetic material is a single, circular, double-stranded Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) molecule. After fragmenting the DNA and performing a base composition analysis, they find that cytosine accounts for 18% of the total nitrogenous bases in the sample. Assuming the standard model of DNA structure holds for this organism, what proportion of the bases in its genome is adenine?\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal value.", "solution": "Let the genomic base fractions be $f_{A}, f_{T}, f_{C}, f_{G}$ with the normalization condition $f_{A} + f_{T} + f_{C} + f_{G} = 1$. For standard double-stranded DNA, Chargaff’s rules apply: $f_{A} = f_{T}$ and $f_{C} = f_{G}$. Given that cytosine accounts for $0.18$ of all bases, we have $f_{C} = 0.18$, hence $f_{G} = 0.18$, so\n$$\nf_{C} + f_{G} = 2 f_{C} = 0.36.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nf_{A} + f_{T} = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64,\n$$\nand since $f_{A} = f_{T}$,\n$$\nf_{A} = \\frac{0.64}{2} = 0.32.\n$$\nThus, the proportion of adenine is $0.32$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.32}$$", "id": "2315420"}, {"introduction": "The pivotal experiment by Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty was designed to definitively identify the \"transforming principle\" first observed by Griffith.

The principle is isolated from heat-killed S-type bacteria.\n\nA novel hypothesis is proposed: the transforming principle is a stable, covalent DNA-protein adduct. In this model, the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) component carries the genetic information for the polysaccharide capsule that confers virulence. The protein component, however, serves as a necessary shuttle, being absolutely required for the uptake of the entire adduct into the recipient R-type cells. The protein itself has no genetic function.\n\nTwo parallel experiments are conducted on separate, identical aliquots of the isolated transforming principle:\n1.  **Experiment 1**: The aliquot is treated with a purified protease, an enzyme that completely and specifically hydrolyzes all peptide bonds, thus destroying proteins.\n2.  **Experiment 2**: The aliquot is treated with a purified Deoxyribonuclease (DNase), an enzyme that completely and specifically hydrolyzes the phosphodiester backbone of DNA.\n\nFollowing each treatment, the resulting mixture is added to a fresh culture of living R-type cells and incubated under conditions that would normally allow for transformation.

By the hypothesis, $P$ is absolutely required for uptake of the adduct; without $P$, $D$ cannot enter R-type cells. Therefore, even if $D$ remains chemically intact, there is no cellular uptake and thus no transformation.\n\nExperiment 2 (DNase treatment):\n- Reaction: $$D\\text{-}P \\xrightarrow{\\text{DNase}} \\text{oligonucleotides/mononucleotides} + P.$$\n- Consequence: The DNA $D$ is degraded, eliminating the genetic information required for capsule synthesis. Even if $P$ could mediate uptake, there is no intact $D$ to confer heritable change. Therefore, no transformation occurs.\n\nPrediction:\n- After protease (Experiment 1): No transformation (uptake blocked due to absence of $P$).\n- After DNase (Experiment 2): No transformation (genetic information destroyed due to absence of intact $D$).\n\nThus, transformation will not be observed after either treatment, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2315411"}]}
