{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Tracking the amount of DNA in a cell is fundamental to understanding the cell cycle. This exercise uses the concept of the $C$-value to quantify the cell's total DNA content at key mitotic stages, reinforcing the critical distinction between chromosome number and the amount of genetic material after replication [@problem_id:1522934]. It provides a quantitative foundation for visualizing the dynamic changes the genome undergoes.", "problem": "A biologist is studying a species of diploid fungus. A single somatic cell from this organism is isolated during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The total amount of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) in a haploid set of this organism's unreplicated chromosomes is denoted by the variable $C$.\n\nDetermine the total DNA content of this single cell at two subsequent points in time:\n1. During mitotic prophase.\n2. Immediately after the centromeres divide and the sister chromatids separate during mitotic anaphase, but before the cell itself has divided.\n\nPresent your answers as an ordered pair in terms of the variable $C$, corresponding to the DNA content at prophase and anaphase, respectively.", "solution": "Let $C$ denote the total DNA content of one haploid set of unreplicated chromosomes.\n\nA diploid somatic cell in G1 contains two haploid sets, each unreplicated, so its total DNA at G1 is\n$$D_{\\text{G1}}=2C.$$\n\nDNA replication occurs during S phase, doubling the DNA content without changing ploidy. Therefore, by the end of S and throughout G2 and into mitotic prophase, the total DNA is\n$$D_{\\text{prophase}}=2 \\times D_{\\text{G1}}=4C.$$\n\nDuring mitotic anaphase, after centromeres divide and sister chromatids separate, the chromatids become independent chromosomes and segregate, but the cell has not yet divided. No DNA is gained or lost at this step, so the total DNA within the single cell remains\n$$D_{\\text{anaphase}}=D_{\\text{prophase}}=4C.$$\n\nThus, the ordered pair (prophase, anaphase) of DNA contents is $(4C, 4C)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(4C, 4C)}$$", "id": "1522934"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply counting chromosomes, a deeper understanding of mitosis requires visualizing their physical structure. This problem challenges you to count telomeres—the protective caps at the ends of linear chromosomes—during anaphase, a stage where the number of distinct chromosomal structures temporarily doubles within the cell [@problem_id:1522910]. This practice sharpens your attention to the structural details of genetic material during cell division.", "problem": "A healthy human somatic cell is undergoing mitosis. In humans, the normal diploid number of chromosomes is 46. Telomeres are the protective structures found at both ends of a linear chromosome. Considering the state of the genetic material during the mitotic process, determine the total number of telomeres present within the entire cell at the specific point in time when it is in anaphase.", "solution": "A healthy human somatic cell has a diploid chromosome number of $N_{\\text{chrom}}=46$ at $G_1$. After $S$ phase and entering mitosis, each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids, so the total number of chromatids is\n$$\nN_{\\text{chromatid}}=2\\times N_{\\text{chrom}}=2\\times 46=92.\n$$\nEach linear chromatid has two telomeres (one at each end). Therefore, the total number of telomeres in the entire cell is\n$$\nN_{\\text{tel}}=2\\times N_{\\text{chromatid}}=2\\times 92=184.\n$$\nAt anaphase, sister chromatids have separated and are counted as individual chromosomes, but the total number of chromatids (now individual chromosomes) within the entire cell remains $92$, so the total telomere count remains\n$$\nN_{\\text{tel}}=184.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{184}$$", "id": "1522910"}, {"introduction": "Mitosis is not just a mechanical process but a tightly regulated sequence of molecular events. This thought experiment explores the critical control point of the metaphase-to-anaphase transition by asking what would happen if cohesin, the molecular 'glue' holding sister chromatids together, were indestructible [@problem_id:1522926]. Solving this will test your grasp of the enzymes and checkpoint mechanisms that ensure faithful chromosome segregation.", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is studying a novel, engineered eukaryotic cell line. In these cells, the cohesin protein complex, which is responsible for holding sister chromatids together after DNA replication, has been modified. Specifically, a key subunit of the complex has been mutated such that it is completely resistant to cleavage by the protease enzyme known as separase. Assume all other cellular machinery, including the spindle assembly checkpoint and the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), functions normally.\n\nIf these engineered cells are allowed to enter the mitotic cycle, at which of the following stages will the cell cycle permanently arrest?\n\nA. Prophase\n\nB. Metaphase\n\nC. Anaphase\n\nD. Telophase\n\nE. Interphase", "solution": "1) State the normal roles and sequence of mitotic regulators. After S phase, sister chromatids are held together by the cohesin complex. During mitosis, arm cohesin is largely removed in prophase/prometaphase, while centromeric cohesin remains to maintain sister chromatid cohesion at kinetochores. The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) permits activation of the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) only when all kinetochores are properly attached and under tension. Upon SAC satisfaction, APC/C ubiquitinates securin and cyclin B, leading to securin degradation and activation of separase. Activated separase cleaves the kleisin subunit of cohesin, releasing cohesion and triggering the onset of anaphase.\n\n2) Apply the engineered modification to this sequence. The engineered mutation renders a key cohesin subunit completely resistant to separase cleavage. Therefore, even when APC/C is activated and separase is fully active (normal APC/C and SAC assumed), separase cannot cleave cohesin at centromeres. Sister chromatid cohesion thus persists.\n\n3) Infer the stage at which progression fails. Without cohesin cleavage, sister chromatids cannot separate, which is the defining event for anaphase onset. Although chromosomes can align at the metaphase plate with proper bipolar attachment and tension (thus satisfying the SAC), the mechanical separation that initiates anaphase cannot occur.\n\n4) Conclude the arrest point. Because anaphase onset strictly requires cohesin cleavage by separase, and that cleavage is impossible in these cells, the cell cannot transition out of metaphase. Therefore, the cell will arrest in metaphase rather than progressing to anaphase, telophase, or returning to interphase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1522926"}]}
