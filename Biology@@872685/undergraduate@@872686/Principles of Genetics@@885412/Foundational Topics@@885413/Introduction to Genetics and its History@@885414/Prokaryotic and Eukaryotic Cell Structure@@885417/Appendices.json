This process of protein sorting is not random; it relies on specific molecular \"address labels\" within the protein's sequence. This first exercise explores the most critical entry point into the secretory pathway, challenging you to predict the fate of a protein when its N-terminal signal peptide—its \"entry ticket\" into the endoplasmic reticulum—is missing [@problem_id:1514038]. Understanding this reveals the cell's default destination for proteins that fail to enter this complex trafficking network.", "problem": "A biotechnology firm is using genetically engineered CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells to produce a therapeutic enzyme called \"Secretase-X\". Under normal conditions, Secretase-X is synthesized and actively secreted from the cells into the culture medium. This process is known to be directed by a specific 20-amino-acid sequence at the N-terminus of the newly synthesized polypeptide, which acts as a signal peptide. A new cell line is generated with a mutation in the gene for Secretase-X. This mutation results in a precise deletion of the genetic code for this 20-amino-acid N-terminal signal peptide, but the rest of the protein's coding sequence remains intact and functional. Assuming the mutated protein is stable and correctly folded, where would it predominantly accumulate within these CHO cells?\n\nA. The nucleus\n\nB. The cytosol\n\nC. The mitochondrial matrix\n\nD. Secreted into the culture medium\n\nE. Bound to the exterior of the plasma membrane", "solution": "- Principle of protein targeting to the secretory pathway: Proteins destined for secretion or for residence in the endomembrane system typically possess an N-terminal signal peptide that is recognized co-translationally by the signal recognition particle (SRP). SRP binding pauses translation and targets the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where translation resumes and the polypeptide is translocated into the ER lumen. The signal peptide is generally cleaved in the ER. From the ER, the protein traffics through the Golgi apparatus and is ultimately secreted.\n\n- Consequence of deleting the N-terminal signal peptide: If the 20-amino-acid N-terminal signal peptide is precisely deleted, SRP will not recognize the nascent chain, the ribosome will not be targeted to the ER membrane, and translation will proceed on free cytosolic ribosomes. Without entry into the ER, the protein cannot access the secretory pathway and therefore cannot be secreted.\n\n- Default localization in the absence of targeting signals: In eukaryotic cells, the default destination for proteins synthesized on free ribosomes without any positive targeting signals is the cytosol.\n\n- Exclusion of other compartments:\n  - Nucleus (Option A): Nuclear localization requires an internal nuclear localization signal (NLS), typically rich in Lys and Arg; deletion of a secretory signal does not create an NLS, and none is indicated. Thus nuclear accumulation is not expected.\n  - Mitochondrial matrix (Option C): Mitochondrial import generally requires an N-terminal amphipathic targeting sequence distinct from an ER signal peptide. None is provided, so mitochondrial targeting is not expected.\n  - Secreted (Option D): Secretion requires ER entry via the signal peptide; without it, secretion will not occur.\n  - Bound to the exterior of the plasma membrane (Option E): Cell-surface localization typically requires passage through the secretory pathway and often a transmembrane segment or GPI anchor; without ER targeting, this is not expected.\n\n- Given that the mutated protein is stable and correctly folded, in the absence of any other targeting signals, it will predominantly remain in the cytosol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1514038"}, {"introduction": "Once a protein successfully enters the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), its journey is far from over. It must be transported to the Golgi apparatus for further processing and sorting. This exercise introduces you to the machinery of this transport, specifically the COPII-coated vesicles that act as cargo carriers between the ER and Golgi. By analyzing a classic cell biology experiment involving a temperature-sensitive mutation, you will learn how scientists can dissect this dynamic pathway and predict the consequences of a transport blockage [@problem_id:1514047].", "problem": "A team of geneticists is studying protein trafficking in a cultured line of eukaryotic cells. They have identified a strain with a temperature-sensitive mutation in a gene encoding a crucial component of the Coat Protein Complex II (COPII). At the permissive temperature (32°C), the protein functions normally, and the cells exhibit a wild-type phenotype. However, when the cells are shifted to the restrictive temperature (40°C), the mutant COPII protein rapidly denatures and becomes non-functional.\n\nThe researchers' goal is to trace the fate of newly synthesized secretory proteins after the transport machinery is disabled. To do this, they first culture the cells at 32°C. They then add a pulse of a radiolabeled amino acid to the culture medium for a very short period to label newly synthesized proteins. Immediately after the pulse, they shift the culture to the restrictive temperature of 40°C. They then allow the cells to incubate for a period sufficient for these labeled proteins to have been fully secreted in wild-type cells.\n\nGiven that COPII is essential for the formation of vesicles that mediate anterograde transport in the early secretory pathway, which of the following outcomes would the researchers most likely observe in the mutant cells at the restrictive temperature?\n\nA. Radiolabeled proteins will accumulate in the cytoplasm, and the nucleus will become abnormally enlarged.\n\nB. Radiolabeled proteins will accumulate in the lumen of the Endoplasmic Reticulum, and the Endoplasmic Reticulum will become abnormally enlarged.\n\nC. Radiolabeled proteins will accumulate in the cisternae of the *cis*-Golgi network, and the Golgi apparatus will become abnormally enlarged.\n\nD. Radiolabeled proteins will accumulate within lysosomes, and the lysosomes will become abnormally enlarged.\n\nE. Radiolabeled proteins will accumulate in secretory vesicles near the plasma membrane, and the *trans*-Golgi network will become abnormally enlarged.", "solution": "The key biological principles are: secretory proteins destined for secretion or the plasma membrane are synthesized on ribosomes bound to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) due to an N-terminal signal sequence and are cotranslationally translocated into the ER lumen; anterograde transport from the ER to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and the cis-Golgi requires vesicle budding mediated by COPII; temperature-sensitive mutations render the COPII component nonfunctional at the restrictive temperature, thereby blocking ER export; pulse-chase labeling marks proteins synthesized during the pulse, and a shift immediately after the pulse freezes subsequent trafficking steps according to the status of the transport machinery at the new temperature.\n\nApply these to the experiment: cells are cultured at the permissive temperature so COPII is functional. A brief pulse of radiolabeled amino acid labels proteins being synthesized in that short window; those secretory proteins enter the ER lumen cotranslationally. Immediately after the pulse, the culture is shifted to the restrictive temperature, at which the mutant COPII protein denatures and COPII function is lost. Because exit from the ER requires COPII-coated vesicle formation, the labeled cohort that has just entered the ER cannot bud from the ER once the temperature is shifted. Even though the incubation time would suffice for secretion in wild-type cells, in the mutant at restrictive temperature the labeled proteins are retained in the ER lumen. Accumulation of proteins within the ER lumen leads to ER distension and enlargement.\n\nEvaluate options based on these principles: accumulation in the cytoplasm (A) is incorrect because secretory proteins are targeted into the ER rather than remaining cytosolic; accumulation in the cis-Golgi (C), lysosomes (D), or secretory vesicles near the plasma membrane (E) would require successful ER export, which is blocked when COPII is nonfunctional. Therefore, radiolabeled proteins will accumulate in the ER lumen, and the ER will become enlarged.\n\nThus, the most likely observation is radiolabeled proteins accumulating in the lumen of the ER with ER enlargement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1514047"}, {"introduction": "After journeying through the ER and Golgi, proteins arrive at the *trans*-Golgi Network, the cell's primary sorting station. Here, proteins are packaged into different vesicles based on specific molecular tags that direct them to their final locations. This practice focuses on the specific mannose-6-phosphate ($M6P$) tag that acts as an \"address label\" for enzymes destined for the lysosome. By examining a scenario analogous to a human genetic disorder, you will determine what happens when this crucial sorting signal is absent, thereby uncovering the default or \"constitutive\" secretory route [@problem_id:1513993].", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the proper functioning of lysosomes relies on the accurate delivery of newly synthesized acid hydrolases. This trafficking is orchestrated by a specific molecular tag. Proteins destined for the lysosome are first co-translationally imported into the endoplasmic reticulum and then transported to the Golgi apparatus. In the *cis*-Golgi network, the enzyme GlcNAc-phosphotransferase normally adds a phosphate group to mannose residues on these hydrolases, creating a mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) tag. This tag is later recognized by M6P-receptors in the *trans*-Golgi network, ensuring the enzymes are sorted into vesicles bound for the lysosome.\n\nConsider a cell line derived from a patient with a severe form of inclusion-cell (I-cell) disease. These cells possess a genetic defect rendering the GlcNAc-phosphotransferase enzyme completely non-functional. As a result, the mannose-6-phosphate tag cannot be added to the lysosomal hydrolases. Assuming the hydrolase proteins themselves are synthesized and folded correctly, what will be the primary final destination of these untagged lysosomal hydrolases?\n\nA. They will be retained and accumulate in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nB. They will be returned to the cytoplasm and degraded by the proteasome.\n\nC. They will enter the constitutive secretory pathway and be released into the extracellular space.\n\nD. They will accumulate in the *trans*-Golgi network, unable to be packaged into vesicles.\n\nE. They will be correctly delivered to the lysosomes but will remain inactive due to the absence of the tag.", "solution": "Lysosomal acid hydrolases are synthesized into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, traverse to the Golgi apparatus, and in the cis-Golgi normally receive a mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) modification catalyzed by GlcNAc-phosphotransferase. This M6P tag is the sorting signal recognized by M6P receptors in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), which package the hydrolases into clathrin-coated vesicles destined for endosomes and then lysosomes. Thus, the physical principle of receptor-mediated sorting in the TGN depends on the presence of the M6P tag.\n\nIn I-cell disease (mucolipidosis II), GlcNAc-phosphotransferase is nonfunctional, so soluble lysosomal hydrolases do not acquire M6P. Without the M6P tag, these hydrolases cannot bind M6P receptors and therefore cannot be specifically sorted into lysosome-directed transport vesicles. In the absence of a positive sorting signal, soluble proteins that have correctly folded and exited the ER follow the default constitutive secretory pathway from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, where they are released into the extracellular space. This leads to a characteristic increase in lysosomal enzyme activity in extracellular fluids and a deficiency of these enzymes within lysosomes, causing accumulation of undegraded substrates (inclusion bodies).\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because correctly folded hydrolases lack ER retention signals (such as KDEL) and are not retained in the ER.\n- Option B is incorrect because ER-associated degradation with retrotranslocation to the cytosol and proteasomal degradation targets misfolded proteins; the hydrolases here are properly folded.\n- Option C is correct because, lacking M6P, the hydrolases are not captured by M6P receptors in the TGN and therefore enter the constitutive secretory pathway and are secreted.\n- Option D is incorrect because, without receptor capture, the hydrolases do not accumulate in the TGN; they proceed by default to secretion.\n- Option E is incorrect because the issue is mistargeting, not catalytic inactivity; absence of M6P impairs sorting, not enzyme activity per se.\n\nTherefore, the primary final destination of the untagged lysosomal hydrolases is the extracellular space via constitutive secretion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1513993"}]}
