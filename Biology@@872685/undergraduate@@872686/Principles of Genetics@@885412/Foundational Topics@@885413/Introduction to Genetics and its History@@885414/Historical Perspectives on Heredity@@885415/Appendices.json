He studied continuous traits, such as height, and observed a phenomenon he termed \"regression toward mediocrity\" (now known as regression toward the mean). His empirical model for this phenomenon can be described as follows:\n\nFor a given quantitative trait, let the population average be $\\mu$. The \"mid-parent\" value, $P_{mid}$, is defined as the arithmetic mean of the trait values of the two parents. Galton observed that the expected trait value of an offspring, $O$, does not typically equal the mid-parent value. Instead, the deviation of the offspring's value from the mid-parent value is a fixed fraction of the mid-parent's deviation from the population mean. Specifically, for the trait he studied, he found:\n\n$$P_{mid} - O = \\frac{2}{3} (P_{mid} - \\mu)$$\n\nNow, consider a hypothetical quantitative trait in a plant species that follows this Galtonian model of inheritance. A researcher selects two parent plants from a large population. The first parent's trait value is measured to be $9.0$ units greater than the population average. The second parent's trait value is $6.0$ units greater than the population average. Based on Galton's regression principle as stated above, what is the expected trait value of an offspring produced by these two parents, expressed as a deviation from the population average?\n\nCalculate your answer in units, and round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "We use Galton’s empirical regression relation for the expected offspring value $O$ relative to the mid-parent value $P_{mid}$ and the population mean $\\mu$:\n$$P_{mid} - O = \\frac{2}{3}\\left(P_{mid} - \\mu\\right).$$\nRearrange to express $O - \\mu$:\n$$O = P_{mid} - \\frac{2}{3}\\left(P_{mid} - \\mu\\right),$$\n$$O - \\mu = \\left(P_{mid} - \\mu\\right) - \\frac{2}{3}\\left(P_{mid} - \\mu\\right) = \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\left(P_{mid} - \\mu\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(P_{mid} - \\mu\\right).$$\nCompute the mid-parent deviation from the mean.

To settle a dispute at their university's biology club, two students, one a proponent of Francis Galton's Law of Ancestral Heredity and the other a champion of the emerging polygenic Mendelian model, design a definitive experiment.\n\nThey start with a species of self-pollinating plant and choose a quantitative trait: nectar sugar concentration, measured in grams per 100 mL. They have access to two distinct, true-breeding (pure) lines:\n-   Line A, which consistently produces nectar with a high sugar concentration of $C_A = 30.0$ g/100mL.\n-   Line B, which consistently produces nectar with a low sugar concentration of $C_B = 10.0$ g/100mL.\n\nThe experiment proceeds in stages:\n1.  **P Generation:** Plants from Line A are crossed with plants from Line B.\n2.  **F1 Generation:** The resulting F1 offspring are allowed to self-pollinate.\n3.  **F2 Generation:** A large F2 population is grown. As predicted by the Mendelian model, the F2 generation exhibits a wide range of nectar concentrations. From this population, a single plant, which we'll call S1, is selected for its exceptionally high nectar concentration of $C_{S1} = 32.0$ g/100mL. This value is even higher than the original pure high-concentration line, a phenomenon known as transgressive segregation.\n4.  **F3 Generation:** The selected plant S1 is allowed to self-pollinate to produce the F3 generation.\n\nThe two students must now predict the average nectar concentration of this F3 population, $C_{F3}$, based on their competing models.\n\n**Model 1 (Galtonian):** A simplified interpretation of Galton's views is that of \"regression to the mean.\" This model posits that the expected phenotype of the progeny from a self-pollinated parent is the arithmetic mean of the parent's phenotype and the ancestral mean of the population. For this experiment, the ancestral mean, $\\mu$, is defined as the average phenotype of the two original pure-breeding lines (Line A and Line B).\n\n**Model 2 (Mendelian):** A polygenic Mendelian model assumes the trait is controlled by many additive genes. In this idealized scenario, assume that the selected F2 plant (S1) is the result of perfect selection, meaning it has become homozygous for all possible \"high-concentration\" alleles that were segregating in the F2 population. Furthermore, assume environmental effects on the phenotype are negligible, so the phenotype is a perfect reflection of the genotype.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the predicted mean F3 concentration from the Mendelian model ($C_{F3, \\text{Mendel}}$) to the predicted mean F3 concentration from the Galtonian model ($C_{F3, \\text{Galton}}$).
