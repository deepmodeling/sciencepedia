This exercise places you in the role of a classical geneticist, using the results of breeding experiments to test a fundamental hypothesis. By applying the chi-square ($\\chi^2$) goodness-of-fit test, you will statistically determine if a newly discovered trait behaves according to the simple Mendelian model of a single gene with dominant and recessive alleles [@problem_id:1526851].", "problem": "A geneticist discovers a new heritable trait in fruit flies (*Drosophila melanogaster*) which they call \"Luminous Bristles\" (LB). The wild-type phenotype is \"Normal Bristles\" (NB). To investigate the genetic basis of this trait, a series of controlled crosses are performed.\n\nFirst, a true-breeding fly with Luminous Bristles is crossed with a true-breeding fly with Normal Bristles. All of the resulting F1 generation flies exhibit Luminous Bristles.\n\nTwo experiments are then conducted:\n1.  **Experiment 1**: F1 flies are intercrossed, producing an F2 generation. The F2 generation consists of 921 flies with Luminous Bristles and 279 flies with Normal Bristles.\n2.  **Experiment 2**: F1 flies are crossed with true-breeding Normal Bristle flies. The offspring from this cross consist of 418 flies with Luminous Bristles and 382 flies with Normal Bristles.\n\nYou are tasked with evaluating the hypothesis that the Luminous Bristles trait is controlled by a single gene with simple dominance, consistent with Mendelian inheritance. To do this, perform a chi-square ($\\chi^2$) goodness-of-fit test on the data from *both* experiments. Calculate the individual $\\chi^2$ value for each experiment based on the expected Mendelian ratios, and then find the sum of these two values.\n\nWhat is the total $\\chi^2$ value for the combined results of both experiments?

This thought experiment replicates the logic of the Nobel Prize-winning work that deciphered the genetic code. By analyzing the products of a synthetic mRNA, you will explore the triplet nature of codons and the critical importance of the \"reading frame\" in translation [@problem_id:1526881].", "problem": "In an experiment mimicking the classic work of Nirenberg and Khorana to decipher the genetic code, a biochemist synthesizes a long strand of synthetic messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) with a repeating trinucleotide sequence, `(GUC)n`. This synthetic mRNA is then added to a cell-free translation system containing all the necessary components for protein synthesis (ribosomes, tRNAs, amino acids, and energy sources). In this simplified system, translation can initiate at any position along the mRNA strand, meaning there is no fixed start codon.\n\nGiven the following partial genetic code table, which of the following best describes the polypeptide products synthesized in this experiment?\n\n- `GUC`: Valine (Val)\n- `UCG`: Serine (Ser)\n- `CGU`: Arginine (Arg)\n- `GCA`: Alanine (Ala)\n- `CUG`: Leucine (Leu)\n- `UGC`: Cysteine (Cys)\n\nA.

For a perfectly repeating trinucleotide polymer, there are exactly three possible reading frames:\n\n1. Initiation at the first nucleotide of a `GUC` triplet yields the repeating codon sequence `GUC`, `GUC`, `GUC`, $\\ldots$, which encodes Valine. This produces a homopolypeptide of Valine.\n\n2. Initiation at the second nucleotide (the `U` of `GUC`) yields the repeating codon sequence `UCG`, `UCG`, `UCG`, $\\ldots$, which encodes Serine. This produces a homopolypeptide of Serine.\n\n3. Initiation at the third nucleotide (the `C` of `GUC`) yields the repeating codon sequence `CGU`, `CGU`, `CGU`, $\\ldots$, which encodes Arginine.

This problem explores the crucial process of mRNA splicing, where introns are removed to form a mature message. You will diagnose a surprising molecular outcome where a mutation deep within an intron leads to the loss of an entire exon, highlighting that a gene's function depends on more than just its coding regions [@problem_id:1526880].", "problem": "A researcher is studying a gene in a eukaryotic organism that encodes a 400-amino-acid protein. The gene consists of 5 exons and 4 introns. A spontaneous point mutation is identified deep within Intron 3 (the intron separating Exon 3 and Exon 4). Analysis of the protein produced from this mutated gene reveals that it is a stable protein, but it is missing precisely the 25 amino acids that are encoded by Exon 3. The rest of the protein sequence, corresponding to Exons 1, 2, 4, and 5, is completely normal. Which of the following is the most likely molecular explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The mutation created a premature stop codon within Intron 3, triggering nonsense-mediated decay of the portion of the pre-mRNA corresponding to Exon 3.\n\nB. The mutation destroyed the canonical 5' splice donor site at the boundary between Exon 3 and Intron 3.\n\nC. The mutation created a new promoter sequence within Intron 3, leading to the synthesis of a truncated transcript initiated from that point.\n\nD. The mutation disrupted an intronic splicing enhancer (ISE) element within Intron 3, which is required for the proper recognition of Exon 3 by the spliceosome.\n\nE. The mutation created a new, cryptic 3' splice acceptor site within Intron 3 that is used preferentially, leading to a frameshift and premature termination of the protein after Exon 2.", "solution": "We are told that a point mutation occurs deep within Intron 3 (between Exon 3 and Exon 4), and the resulting protein is stable but lacks precisely the amino acids encoded by Exon 3, with all other exons’ sequences normal. This pattern is most consistent with exon skipping during pre-mRNA splicing, specifically skipping of Exon 3.\n\nKey splicing principle: proper exon inclusion depends on exon definition, which involves splice sites at exon-intron boundaries and auxiliary cis-elements such as exonic and intronic splicing enhancers and silencers. Disruption of enhancers needed for exon recognition can cause the spliceosome to skip that exon, joining the flanking exons directly. If the length of the skipped exon in nucleotides is divisible by $3$, then the open reading frame is preserved, and the protein remains stable but lacks the exact segment encoded by that exon. Since each amino acid corresponds to $3$ nucleotides, $L_{\\text{nt}}=3L_{\\text{aa}}$, and exon skipping preserves the reading frame when $L_{\\text{nt}}$ is a multiple of $3$. The observation that the protein is stable and missing exactly the amino acids encoded by Exon 3 implies that Exon 3’s length is a multiple of $3$, so exon skipping yields an in-frame deletion.\n\nEvaluate the options in light of the location and consequence:\n- Option A (premature stop codon in an intron causing nonsense-mediated decay of the portion corresponding to Exon 3) is incorrect because introns are removed during splicing; a stop codon in an intron has no effect unless the intron is retained. Nonsense-mediated decay targets the entire mRNA containing a premature termination codon upstream of an exon-exon junction and does not selectively delete a single exon to produce a stable protein missing exactly that exon’s amino acids.\n- Option B (destruction of the canonical $5'$ splice donor at the Exon 3–Intron 3 boundary) is unlikely both because the mutation is stated to be deep within the intron (not at the boundary) and because such a lesion commonly leads to intron retention or activation of cryptic splice sites, often causing frameshifts or premature termination rather than a clean, in-frame loss of an entire exon with all other exons normal.\n- Option C (a new promoter in Intron 3) would initiate transcription downstream of Exon 3, typically producing a transcript lacking all upstream exons (e.g., Exons 1–3) or altering the $5'$ end, not a product missing only Exon 3 with Exons 1, 2, 4, and 5 intact and properly joined.\n- Option D (disruption of an intronic splicing enhancer within Intron 3 required for recognition of Exon 3) directly fits both the location (“deep within” the intron) and the outcome (exon skipping of Exon 3). Loss of an intronic splicing enhancer impairs spliceosome recruitment and exon definition for the adjacent exon, leading to its exclusion while the remaining exons are spliced normally. If Exon 3 is $3k$ nucleotides long, skipping it removes exactly $k$ amino acids and preserves the reading frame, consistent with a stable protein missing precisely those amino acids.\n- Option E (creation of a cryptic $3'$ acceptor in Intron 3 leading to a frameshift and premature termination after Exon 2) predicts a frameshift and truncated, likely unstable protein, not a full-length stable protein missing only Exon 3.\n\nTherefore, the most likely molecular explanation is disruption of an intronic splicing enhancer necessary for Exon 3 inclusion, causing Exon 3 skipping and an in-frame deletion of its encoded amino acids.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1526880"}]}
