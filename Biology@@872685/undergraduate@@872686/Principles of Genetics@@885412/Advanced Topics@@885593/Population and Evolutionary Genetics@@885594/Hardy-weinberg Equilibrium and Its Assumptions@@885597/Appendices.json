This first practice exercise [@problem_id:1495607] demonstrates the most fundamental application of this principle. By knowing the frequency of a recessive phenotype, we can directly calculate the frequency of the recessive allele and, subsequently, the dominant allele, providing a baseline snapshot of the population's gene pool.", "problem": "A species of deep-sea cnidarian, *Cryofax abyssalis*, commonly known as 'Abyssal Flares', exhibits variation in its bioluminescent properties. The ability to produce a bright, continuous glow is controlled by a single gene with two alleles. The allele for a bright glow ($G$) is dominant over the allele for a faint, pulsating glow ($g$). A large, isolated population of these organisms is studied by marine biologists. It is assumed that the population mates randomly and is not subject to mutation, gene flow, or natural selection with respect to this trait. A recent survey of the population reveals that 16% of the individuals exhibit the faint, pulsating glow phenotype.\n\nBased on these observations, what is the frequency of the dominant allele for a bright glow ($G$) in this population? Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "Assuming Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (random mating, no mutation, no migration, no selection), let $p$ be the frequency of the dominant allele $G$ and $q$ be the frequency of the recessive allele $g$.
