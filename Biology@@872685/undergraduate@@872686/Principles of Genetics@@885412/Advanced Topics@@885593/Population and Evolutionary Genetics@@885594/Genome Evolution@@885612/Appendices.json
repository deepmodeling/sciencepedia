The distinction between orthologs and paralogs is fundamental, as it allows us to differentiate between genes separated by speciation events and those that arose from duplication within a single lineage. This exercise will test your ability to apply these key definitions to a classic example from the globin gene family, a cornerstone for understanding genome evolution [@problem_id:1494077].", "problem": "In the field of evolutionary genetics, homologous genes are genes that share a common evolutionary ancestor. These homologs can be further classified into two distinct categories: orthologs and paralogs. Consider the $\\beta$-globin gene, which codes for a subunit of hemoglobin. Both humans and gorillas possess a functional $\\beta$-globin gene in their genomes. A student is asked to determine the evolutionary relationship between the human $\\beta$-globin gene and the gorilla $\\beta$-globin gene.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately classifies this pair of genes and provides the correct evolutionary justification?\n\nA. They are orthologs because they exist in different species (human and gorilla) and originated from a single ancestral gene in the last common ancestor of these two species. Their divergence is the result of a speciation event.\n\nB. They are paralogs because, while they share a common ancestor, they have diverged in function slightly between humans and gorillas. Their divergence is the result of a gene duplication event in the last common ancestor.\n\nC. They are orthologs because the $\\beta$-globin gene is part of the larger globin gene family, which arose through multiple rounds of gene duplication.\n\nD. They are paralogs because they are found in two different, albeit closely related, species. Their divergence is the result of a speciation event that separated the human and gorilla lineages.", "solution": "I begin by recalling the standard definitions in evolutionary genetics. Homologous genes are genes that share a common evolutionary ancestor. Among homologs, orthologs are homologous genes found in different species that diverged following a speciation event from a single gene present in the last common ancestor of those species. Paralogs are homologous genes that arise within a lineage due to a gene duplication event; their divergence is attributed to duplication, not speciation.\n\nThe $\\beta$-globin gene in humans and the $\\beta$-globin gene in gorillas are corresponding genes at the same locus in their respective genomes. Both derive from the $\\beta$-globin gene present in the last common ancestor of humans and gorillas. The divergence between the human and gorilla versions occurred when the human and gorilla lineages split; this is a speciation event. Therefore, by definition, these two genes are orthologs.\n\nIt is important to distinguish this from the relationship among different members of the globin gene family (such as $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, $\\delta$), which arose through gene duplication events. Those relationships (for example, human $\\beta$ versus human $\\delta$) are paralogous. However, comparing the same gene copy across species (human $\\beta$ versus gorilla $\\beta$) reflects orthology, not paralogy.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A correctly states that the human and gorilla $\\beta$-globin genes are orthologs, tracing to a single ancestral gene in their last common ancestor, with divergence due to speciation. This matches the definition.\n- Option B incorrectly classifies them as paralogs and attributes divergence to gene duplication in the last common ancestor. That mechanism would produce paralogs within a genome, not orthologs across species.\n- Option C gives an incorrect justification: while the globin family arose via duplications, that fact supports paralogy among different globin copies, not orthology of the same gene across species.\n- Option D misdefines paralogs and incorrectly attributes their divergence to speciation, which is contradictory since speciation defines orthology.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification and justification are given in Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1494077"}, {"introduction": "One of the most powerful ideas in evolutionary biology is the molecular clock, which allows us to estimate the timing of past events by measuring genetic divergence. By assuming a steady rate of neutral mutation, the number of genetic differences between two lineages can act as a stopwatch, ticking since they last shared a common ancestor. In this practice, you will apply the molecular clock concept to a classic population genetics scenario to calculate the divergence time between two isolated groups [@problem_id:1494041].", "problem": "Population geneticists are studying two isolated populations of an endangered salamander species, one found in the northern mountains and the other in the southern mountains. They hypothesize that these two populations were once a single, larger population that was split by a past geological event. To estimate the time of this separation, they analyzed a specific neutral region of their mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).\n\nUpon comparing the sequences from a sample of individuals from both populations, they found that a segment of length $L = 1500$ base pairs has an average of $n = 25$ nucleotide differences between the two groups. The established neutral mutation rate for this mtDNA region in related species is $\\mu = 1.8 \\times 10^{-8}$ substitutions per site per year.\n\nAssuming the molecular clock model applies and that the mutation rate has been constant, calculate the estimated time since the two salamander populations diverged.

The mutation rate, $\\mu$, is given for a single lineage. Since the two populations diverged from a common ancestor, mutations have been accumulating independently in both lineages.

This problem challenges you to act as a molecular detective, using sequence divergence data and the principles of the molecular clock to date a sophisticated gene duplication event. You will see how different evolutionary rates between a functional gene and its non-functional 'pseudogene' copy can be used to reconstruct the history of the genome [@problem_id:1494053].", "problem": "A team of molecular evolutionists is investigating the origin of a lectin gene in a species of flowering plant. The gene, which we will call `G_plant`, encodes a protein with two structural domains, `A` and `B`. In related fungal species, the homologous lectin protein is encoded by a gene `G_fungus` and has its domains arranged in the order `N-terminus -- A -- B -- C-terminus`. However, in the plant, the gene `G_plant` encodes a protein with a circularly permuted structure, `N-terminus -- B -- A -- C-terminus`.\n\nThe prevailing hypothesis for this rearrangement is a tandem duplication event of an ancestral gene (`G_anc`, identical in structure to `G_fungus`) that occurred at a time `T_event` in the past within the plant lineage. This duplication created a `[Domain A] - [Domain B] - [Domain A] - [Domain B]` sequence on the chromosome. Subsequently, mutations to transcriptional and translational signals caused a new functional gene, `G_plant`, to be expressed from the central `[Domain B] - [Domain A]` segment.\n\nThe original outermost domains from the duplicated segment—the first `Domain A` and the last `Domain B`—were not incorporated into the new gene. These segments became non-functional \"fossil\" sequences known as pseudogenes, `psi_A` and `psi_B`, which can still be found flanking the active `G_plant` gene.\n\nThe functional domains within `G_plant` (`A_func` and `B_func`) are under purifying selection and accumulate nucleotide substitutions at a suppressed rate of `r_s = 2.1 \\times 10^{-9}` substitutions per site per year. The pseudogene `psi_A`, being free from selective pressure, accumulates substitutions at the higher neutral rate of `r_n = 6.5 \\times 10^{-9}` substitutions per site per year.\n\nBy sequencing and comparing the DNA of the functional domain `A_func` with its corresponding pseudogene `psi_A`, the researchers have measured the total nucleotide divergence between them to be `K = 0.535` substitutions per site. Assume that the divergence `K` between two DNA sequences that diverged `T` years ago and evolved at respective rates `r_1` and `r_2` is given by the formula $K = (r_1 + r_2)T$. At the moment of duplication, the sequences for `A_func` and `psi_A` were identical.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the time `T_event` when the gene duplication event occurred.
