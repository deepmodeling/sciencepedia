This first exercise establishes the fundamental principle: if we know how long two species have been evolving independently and the rate at which their genes accumulate mutations, we can predict the amount of genetic difference we expect to see between them today [@problem_id:1504027]. Mastering this forward calculation, based on the core equation $D = 2rT$, is the first step toward using molecular clocks to unravel evolutionary history.", "problem": "Biologists are studying the evolutionary history of two distinct species of extremophilic archaea, *Thermococcus profundus* and *Thermococcus ignis*, which were isolated from separate deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Geological analysis of the volcanic activity in the region combined with fossil evidence of related microorganisms suggests that a single ancestral population was separated into two, leading to the divergence of these two species exactly 2.5 million years ago.\n\nThe researchers sequenced a specific gene coding for a ribosomal protein, which is assumed to be evolving neutrally (i.e., not under the influence of natural selection). For this gene, the rate of nucleotide substitution has been reliably estimated to be constant at a rate, $r$, of $1.2 \\times 10^{-9}$ substitutions per site per year.\n\nAssuming the molecular clock hypothesis is valid for this gene, calculate the expected proportion of nucleotide sites that will differ between the two species when this gene is compared.", "solution": "The molecular clock hypothesis asserts that, for a neutrally evolving gene with constant substitution rate $r$ (substitutions per site per year), each lineage accumulates substitutions at rate $r$. If two lineages diverged $T$ years ago, the expected number of substitutions per site along each lineage is $rT$, and because the two lineages evolve independently after divergence, the expected total substitutions per site separating the two sequences is the sum over both branches:\n$$\nD = 2rT.\n$$\nFor small divergences, where multiple hits at the same site are negligible, the expected proportion of nucleotide sites that differ between the two species (the $p$-distance) equals this expected substitutions-per-site:\n$$\np = 2rT.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $r = 1.2 \\times 10^{-9}$ substitutions per site per year and $T = 2.5 \\times 10^{6}$ years,\n$$\np = 2 \\times \\left(1.2 \\times 10^{-9}\\right) \\times \\left(2.5 \\times 10^{6}\\right)\n= 2 \\times 1.2 \\times 2.5 \\times 10^{-9+6}\n= 6.0 \\times 10^{-3}.\n$$\nThus, the expected proportion of differing sites is $6.0 \\times 10^{-3}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.0 \\times 10^{-3}}$$", "id": "1504027"}, {"introduction": "While predicting divergence is a useful exercise, the true power of the molecular clock for biologists lies in its ability to work in reverse. By measuring the genetic divergence between two species today, we can estimate the time that has passed since they shared a common ancestor [@problem_id:2304075]. This practice puts you in the role of a molecular detective, using DNA evidence from the present to uncover events that happened millions of years in the past.", "problem": "Two populations of a rare, cave-dwelling amphipod (a type of small crustacean) are discovered in two geographically isolated, water-filled cave systems. Biologists hypothesize that these two populations diverged from a common ancestral population when the underground river system connecting the caves collapsed. To estimate when this separation occurred, they sequenced a specific non-coding region of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) from several individuals in both populations.\n\nThe comparison of these sequences reveals an average of 3.5% divergence; that is, 3.5% of the nucleotide sites differ between the two populations. Based on studies of related species and geological dating, the substitution rate for this particular DNA region is estimated to be constant at $r = 2.1 \\times 10^{-9}$ substitutions per site per year.\n\nAssuming this substitution rate has been constant for both lineages since their split, calculate the time that has passed since the two populations diverged.

The divergence time, $T$, can be estimated using the formula $T = \\frac{D}{2r}$, where $D$ is the proportion of divergent amino acid sites between two homologous protein sequences (a dimensionless quantity), and $r$ is the rate of substitution per site per year.\n\nAssume that for the globin gene family, the average rate of amino acid substitution has been empirically determined to be $r = 0.90 \\times 10^{-9}$ substitutions per site per year.\n\nA researcher, intending to calculate the divergence time between the common mouse (*Mus musculus*) and the brown rat (*Rattus norvegicus*), makes a procedural error. Instead of comparing the sequences of an orthologous gene between the two species (e.g., mouse beta-globin vs. rat beta-globin), they mistakenly align and compare the protein sequences of alpha-globin and beta-globin taken from *only the mouse*. The alignment and subsequent analysis show that the proportion of differing amino acid sites between the mouse alpha-globin and mouse beta-globin sequences is $D = 0.855$.\n\nUsing the given substitution rate $r$ and the researcher's flawed data, calculate the apparent divergence time this analysis would suggest.
