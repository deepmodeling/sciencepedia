{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The development of the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, provides one of the most well-understood examples of pattern formation, with the *bicoid* gene product establishing the primary anterior-posterior axis. The Bicoid protein acts as a morphogen, forming a concentration gradient from the head to the tail, where different concentrations specify distinct body regions. This exercise [@problem_id:1507670] challenges you to predict the developmental outcome when the initial amount of this morphogen is doubled, a fundamental test of your understanding of how morphogen dosage translates into positional information.", "problem": "In the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster*, the establishment of the anterior-posterior body axis in the early embryo is a classic example of pattern formation driven by positional information. This process is initiated by maternal effect genes, whose products are deposited into the egg by the mother. One of the most critical of these genes is *bicoid*. The *bicoid* protein functions as a transcription factor, and its concentration within the syncytial embryo determines the developmental fate of different regions. A very high concentration of Bicoid protein at the anterior end of the embryo specifies the formation of head structures. Progressively lower concentrations along the axis specify the formation of thoracic structures. In regions where the Bicoid protein concentration falls below a certain minimal threshold, posterior abdominal structures are formed.\n\nA developmental biologist has created a transgenic strain of *Drosophila* in which females are homozygous for a duplication of the chromosome arm carrying the *bicoid* gene. As a result, these females possess four functional copies of the *bicoid* gene instead of the normal two copies found in wild-type flies. These females are then mated with wild-type males.\n\nConsidering the role of the Bicoid protein in providing positional information, which of the following outcomes is the most likely phenotype for the embryos produced by these transgenic mothers?\n\nA. The embryos will develop two heads, one at the anterior end and a second at the posterior end.\n\nB. The head and thoracic structures will occupy a larger fraction of the embryo's length than in wild-type, leading to a reduction and compression of the abdominal segments at the posterior end.\n\nC. The embryos will be indistinguishable from wild-type embryos, because developmental systems are robust and will compensate for the increased gene dosage.\n\nD. The embryos will fail to develop any head or thoracic structures and will instead consist almost entirely of abdominal segments.\n\nE. The overall size of the embryos will be doubled, but the relative proportions of the head, thoracic, and abdominal segments will be identical to wild-type.", "solution": "In early Drosophila embryos, the maternal transcription factor Bicoid forms an anterior-to-posterior concentration gradient and specifies positional information via concentration thresholds that activate different zygotic targets. A standard model for the Bicoid gradient is an exponential profile:\n$$\nC(x)=C_{0}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $x$ is the position from the anterior pole, $C_{0}$ is the anterior concentration amplitude set by maternal deposition of bicoid mRNA and protein, and $\\lambda$ is the characteristic length scale of the gradient. Developmental fates are specified at positions $x$ where the concentration crosses fate-specific thresholds $T_{i}$; the boundary for threshold $T$ is defined by solving $C(x_{T})=T$:\n$$\nC_{0}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x_{T}}{\\lambda}\\right)=T \\;\\Rightarrow\\; x_{T}=\\lambda\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{T}\\right).\n$$\nIncreasing maternal bicoid gene dosage from the wild-type to a higher copy number increases the deposited Bicoid pool, scaling the amplitude $C_{0}$ by a factor $k>1$ while leaving $\\lambda$ approximately unchanged. With $C_{0}'=kC_{0}$, the new threshold position becomes\n$$\nx_{T}'=\\lambda\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{kC_{0}}{T}\\right)=\\lambda\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{T}\\right)+\\lambda\\ln k=x_{T}+\\lambda\\ln k,\n$$\nwhich is a posterior shift by $\\lambda\\ln k$. Thus, all anterior and thoracic fate boundaries move posteriorly, expanding the domains specified by higher Bicoid concentrations and compressing the posterior abdominal region where Bicoid is below minimal thresholds.\n\nThis prediction rules out two heads (which would require an ectopic posterior source of Bicoid, not merely increased dosage), rules out a normal phenotype (because threshold positions depend logarithmically on $C_{0}$ and are dosage-sensitive), rules out loss of head/thorax (which occurs with reduced or absent Bicoid), and rules out doubled embryo size (gene dosage of bicoid affects patterning thresholds, not overall embryo dimensions). Therefore, the most likely phenotype is expansion of head and thoracic structures with a posterior compression of abdominal segments.\n\nThe correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1507670"}, {"introduction": "While a single morphogen can establish a basic axis, many developmental systems use multiple, often opposing, gradients to achieve greater precision and define intermediate regions.

Consider a simplified one-dimensional model of a developing tissue that occupies the region $x \\ge 0$. A morphogen, S, is produced at a localized source at $x=0$ and diffuses into the tissue, establishing a steady-state exponential concentration gradient given by $[S](x) = S_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, where $S_0$ is the concentration at the source, $x$ is the distance from the source, and $\\lambda$ is the characteristic decay length of the gradient.\n\nThis morphogen gradient orchestrates the expression of a target gene, G, through a simple regulatory network. The morphogen S directly activates two intermediate regulatory genes: an activator, A, and a repressor, R. The expression of these genes is governed by sharp concentration thresholds:\n- Gene A is expressed at any position $x$ where the local morphogen concentration $[S](x)$ is greater than a threshold $K_A$.\n- Gene R is expressed at any position $x$ where $[S](x)$ is greater than a threshold $K_R$.\n\nThe synthesis of the protein product of gene G is, in turn, controlled by A and R. Gene G is expressed if and only if gene A is expressed and gene R is not expressed. You are given that the thresholds are different, with $K_R > K_A$, and that the source concentration $S_0$ is greater than both $K_R$ and $K_A$. This network architecture results in the expression of gene G within a well-defined stripe of finite width.\n\nYour task is to derive a closed-form analytic expression for the width of this expression stripe, $\\Delta x$, in terms of the given parameters.", "solution": "The problem asks for the width of the spatial domain where gene G is expressed. According to the problem statement, gene G is expressed only when gene A is expressed AND gene R is not expressed. We must first determine the spatial regions where genes A and R are expressed.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the expression domain of gene A.**\nGene A is expressed where the morphogen concentration $[S](x)$ exceeds the threshold $K_A$. The morphogen concentration is given by $[S](x) = S_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$.\nThe condition for A's expression is:\n$$[S](x) > K_A$$\n$$S_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda) > K_A$$\nTo find the extent of this region, we solve for the boundary position, which we can call $x_A$, where $[S](x_A) = K_A$. For any $x < x_A$, the concentration will be higher, and for any $x > x_A$, the concentration will be lower.\n$$S_0 \\exp(-x_A/\\lambda) = K_A$$\nWe can solve for $x_A$:\n$$\\exp(-x_A/\\lambda) = \\frac{K_A}{S_0}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\frac{x_A}{\\lambda} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_A}{S_0}\\right)$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(a/b) = -\\ln(b/a)$:\n$$\\frac{x_A}{\\lambda} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_0}{K_A}\\right)$$\n$$x_A = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_0}{K_A}\\right)$$\nSince $S_0 > K_A$, the argument of the logarithm is greater than 1, and $x_A > 0$. Gene A is expressed in the interval $0 \\le x < x_A$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the expression domain of gene R.**\nSimilarly, gene R is expressed where the morphogen concentration $[S](x)$ exceeds the threshold $K_R$.\nThe condition for R's expression is:\n$$[S](x) > K_R$$\n$$S_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda) > K_R$$\nWe find the boundary position, $x_R$, where $[S](x_R) = K_R$.\n$$S_0 \\exp(-x_R/\\lambda) = K_R$$\nSolving for $x_R$:\n$$\\exp(-x_R/\\lambda) = \\frac{K_R}{S_0}$$\n$$-\\frac{x_R}{\\lambda} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_R}{S_0}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{x_R}{\\lambda} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_0}{K_R}\\right)$$\n$$x_R = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_0}{K_R}\\right)$$\nSince $S_0 > K_R$, the argument of the logarithm is greater than 1, and $x_R > 0$. Gene R is expressed in the interval $0 \\le x < x_R$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the expression domain of gene G.**\nGene G is expressed where A is ON and R is OFF.\n- The region where A is ON is $0 \\le x < x_A$.\n- The region where R is ON is $0 \\le x < x_R$. This means R is OFF for $x \\ge x_R$.\n\nWe need to satisfy both conditions simultaneously.\n1. `A is ON`: $x < x_A$\n2. `R is OFF`: $x \\ge x_R$\n\nCombining these gives the expression domain for G: $x_R \\le x < x_A$.\nThis defines a stripe that starts at $x_{start} = x_R$ and ends at $x_{end} = x_A$.\n\nThe problem states that $K_R > K_A$.
