This practice is crucial for understanding the experimental basis of cancer genetics and the definition of an oncogene [@problem_id:1507154].", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating the genetic basis of a highly aggressive form of human bladder carcinoma. The primary hypothesis is that the cancer is driven by a single, dominant, activated oncogene. To test this, the biologist prepares two samples of genomic DNA:\n1.  `T-DNA`: DNA extracted from the cancerous bladder tumor cells.\n2.  `N-DNA`: DNA extracted from normal, non-cancerous bladder tissue from a healthy donor.\n\nThe biologist uses a well-characterized mouse fibroblast cell line, NIH/3T3, for the experiment. These cells normally exhibit contact inhibition, meaning they grow in a flat, single layer (a monolayer) and stop dividing once they cover the surface of the culture dish. The loss of contact inhibition, leading to cells piling up and forming dense clumps known as foci, is a hallmark of cancerous transformation.\n\nThree parallel cultures of NIH/3T3 cells are prepared:\n-   **Culture 1**: Transfected with the `T-DNA`.\n-   **Culture 2**: Transfected with the `N-DNA`.\n-   **Culture 3**: Subjected to a mock transfection procedure (all steps are followed, but no DNA is added).\n\nThe cells are then allowed to grow for several weeks. Assuming the initial hypothesis is correct, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected macroscopic appearance of the three cultures?\n\nA. All three cultures will form uniform monolayers with no foci.\n\nB. All three cultures will show the formation of multiple foci.\n\nC. Culture 1 will form a uniform monolayer, while Cultures 2 and 3 will show the formation of multiple foci.\n\nD. Culture 1 will show the formation of multiple foci, while Cultures 2 and 3 will form uniform monolayers.\n\nE. Cultures 1 and 2 will show the formation of multiple foci, while Culture 3 will form a uniform monolayer.", "solution": "The experimental setup uses NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, which are contact-inhibited and thus form a uniform monolayer under normal conditions. Transformation by an activated oncogene leads to loss of contact inhibition, producing macroscopic foci. The hypothesis states that the tumor is driven by a single dominant activated oncogene. Dominant in this context means that introduction of a single active copy into a recipient cell is sufficient to confer a transformed phenotype. Genomic DNA from tumor cells (T-DNA) is therefore expected to contain fragments harboring the activated oncogene such that, upon transfection, a subset of NIH/3T3 cells will integrate and express the oncogene, become transformed, and form foci. Because only a fraction of cells will receive and express the oncogenic fragment, the culture will not be uniformly transformed but will exhibit multiple discrete foci against a background monolayer.\n\nIn contrast, genomic DNA from normal tissue (N-DNA) lacks an activated oncogene; its transfection into NIH/3T3 should not induce transformation, so the culture will retain contact inhibition and remain a uniform monolayer. The mock transfection introduces no DNA, so it also yields a uniform monolayer. Therefore, under the stated hypothesis, only Culture 1 (transfected with T-DNA) is expected to show multiple foci, while Cultures 2 and 3 form uniform monolayers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1507154"}, {"introduction": "Oncogenic activation often arises from subtle point mutations that disrupt a protein's normal regulation. This problem asks you to deduce the functional outcome of a single amino acid substitution in the c-Src proto-oncogene, a classic example of a gain-of-function mutation. Understanding how such a small change can lead to a constitutively active protein is fundamental to comprehending the molecular mechanisms of cancer [@problem_id:1507157].", "problem": "The cellular proto-oncogene c-Src encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth, division, and survival. The activity of the c-Src protein is tightly controlled. A key part of this regulation involves the phosphorylation of a specific tyrosine residue, Tyr-527, located near the protein's C-terminus. This phosphorylation event, carried out by another kinase, induces a conformational change that locks c-Src in an inactive state.\n\nConsider a genetic engineering experiment where a mutant version of the c-Src gene is introduced into a line of normal, non-cancerous cells. In this mutant gene, the codon for the regulatory tyrosine at position 527 has been altered to code for phenylalanine. Phenylalanine is an amino acid that is structurally very similar to tyrosine, but it lacks the hydroxyl (-OH) group on its aromatic ring.\n\nAssuming the mutant c-Src protein is expressed at normal levels and is otherwise stable, which of the following outcomes is the most likely consequence of this single amino acid substitution?\n\nA. The cells will exhibit characteristics of cancerous transformation, such as increased proliferation and loss of contact inhibition, because the mutant c-Src will be constitutively active.\n\nB. The mutant c-Src protein will be completely non-functional, leading to no observable change in cellular behavior compared to cells lacking c-Src entirely.\n\nC. The activity of the mutant c-Src protein will be indistinguishable from the wild-type protein, showing normal cycles of activation and inactivation.\n\nD. The mutant c-Src protein will be recognized as misfolded due to the substitution and will be rapidly targeted for degradation by the proteasome.\n\nE. The substrate specificity of the c-Src kinase will change, causing it to phosphorylate serine and threonine residues instead of tyrosine residues.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the cellular outcome of a specific mutation in the proto-oncogene c-Src. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Understand the wild-type regulation of c-Src:** The problem states that c-Src is a proto-oncogenic tyrosine kinase. Its activity is negatively regulated by the phosphorylation of a specific tyrosine residue, Tyr-527. When Tyr-527 is phosphorylated, the protein adopts an inactive conformation. This means that to be active, c-Src must be *dephosphorylated* at this position. This regulatory mechanism ensures that the kinase is only active when appropriate signals are received by the cell.\n\n2.  **Analyze the structure of the involved amino acids:** The mutation replaces tyrosine (Tyr) with phenylalanine (Phe). Both are aromatic amino acids and are structurally similar. However, the key difference, as stated in the problem, is that tyrosine possesses a hydroxyl (-OH) group on its phenyl ring, whereas phenylalanine does not.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the consequence of the mutation on the regulatory mechanism:** The process of phosphorylation involves the enzymatic addition of a phosphate group ($\\text{PO}_4^{3-}$) to an amino acid. For tyrosine kinases, this phosphate group is attached to the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue. Since the mutant protein has a phenylalanine at position 527, it lacks the necessary hydroxyl group at that site. Therefore, the mutant c-Src protein cannot be phosphorylated at position 527.\n\n4.  **Deduce the effect on protein activity:** The inhibitory signal for c-Src is the phosphorylation of Tyr-527. By replacing tyrosine with phenylalanine, we have removed the target for this inhibitory signal. The mutant c-Src can no longer be \"switched off\" by this mechanism. It cannot be locked into the inactive conformation that depends on the phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail. As a result, the kinase domain remains in an open, active conformation, making the enzyme constitutively (continuously) active.\n\n5.  **Connect protein activity to cellular phenotype:** c-Src is a proto-oncogene. Proto-oncogenes code for proteins that promote cell growth and division. When they become hyperactive or are expressed at excessive levels, they can become oncogenes, driving uncontrolled cell proliferation and leading to cancer. A constitutively active c-Src protein will continuously send growth-promoting signals downstream by phosphorylating its target proteins, irrespective of external growth signals. This unregulated signaling leads to hallmark cancer phenotypes like uncontrolled cell division and loss of contact inhibition.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   **A. The cells will exhibit characteristics of cancerous transformation, such as increased proliferation and loss of contact inhibition, because the mutant c-Src will be constitutively active.** This aligns perfectly with our deduction. The loss of the inhibitory phosphorylation site leads to a constitutively active kinase, which drives oncogenic transformation.\n    *   **B. The mutant c-Src protein will be completely non-functional...** This is incorrect. The mutation affects a regulatory site, not the catalytic active site of the kinase. The core machinery for phosphorylation is intact.\n    *   **C. The activity of the mutant c-Src protein will be indistinguishable from the wild-type protein...** This is incorrect. The mutation specifically eliminates the primary \"off-switch\" for the protein, fundamentally altering its regulation.\n    *   **D. The mutant c-Src protein will be recognized as misfolded...and will be rapidly targeted for degradation...** This is unlikely. Phenylalanine is structurally very similar to tyrosine, so a major conformational disruption leading to misfolding and degradation is not the expected outcome. This type of mutation is a classic example of a gain-of-function, not loss-of-function through instability.\n    *   **E. The substrate specificity of the c-Src kinase will change...** This is incorrect. Substrate specificity is determined by the architecture of the kinase's active site (the catalytic domain). The mutation is in the C-terminal regulatory region, which is spatially distinct from the active site and primarily controls overall activity, not which substrates it binds.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that the mutant c-Src becomes an oncogene, driving cancerous transformation due to its constitutive activity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1507157"}, {"introduction": "Instead of altering a protein's function, cancer can arise from simply producing too much of it through a process called gene amplification. This exercise introduces Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH), a powerful diagnostic technique used in clinics to visualize and quantify gene copy numbers in patient tumor cells. By interpreting hypothetical FISH results, you will learn to distinguish true gene amplification from other chromosomal abnormalities, a critical skill in molecular pathology [@problem_id:1507203].", "problem": "In molecular oncology, the conversion of a proto-oncogene into an oncogene can drive uncontrolled cell proliferation. One common mechanism for this conversion is gene amplification, where the copy number of a specific proto-oncogene is significantly increased. A pathologist is analyzing a breast cancer biopsy to determine the status of the *ERBB2* gene, a proto-oncogene located on chromosome 17.\n\nTo do this, the pathologist uses a technique called Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH). This method uses fluorescently labeled DNA probes that bind to specific target sequences on chromosomes within the cell nucleus. For this analysis, two distinct probes are used simultaneously on the interphase nuclei of the tumor cells:\n1. A probe that emits a red signal when bound to the *ERBB2* gene locus.\n2. A control probe that emits a green signal when bound to the centromere of chromosome 17 (CEP17). The centromere probe is used to count the number of copies of chromosome 17 in each cell.\n\nA normal, non-cancerous human somatic cell is diploid and is expected to have two copies of chromosome 17. The pathologist examines numerous cells from the biopsy under a fluorescence microscope. Which of the following observations would be the definitive evidence for *ERBB2* gene amplification, as opposed to other chromosomal abnormalities like polysomy (an increase in the number of whole chromosomes)?\n\nA. The majority of cells display exactly 2 red signals and 2 green signals.\n\nB. The majority of cells display approximately 15 red signals and 2 green signals.\n\nC. The majority of cells display 0 red signals and 2 green signals.\n\nD. The majority of cells display exactly 4 red signals and 4 green signals.\n\nE. The majority of cells display 1 red signal and 1 green signal.", "solution": "The goal of this Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis is to determine if the *ERBB2* proto-oncogene has undergone amplification. This requires distinguishing between an increase in the number of genes due to the duplication of the gene itself (amplification) and an increase in the number of genes due to the duplication of the entire chromosome (polysomy).\n\nLet's break down the experimental setup:\n- The red probe targets the *ERBB2* gene. The number of red signals corresponds to the total number of copies of the *ERBB2* gene.\n- The green probe targets the centromere of chromosome 17 (CEP17). The number of green signals corresponds to the total number of copies of chromosome 17.\n\nA normal diploid cell has two copies of chromosome 17. Therefore, a normal cell would show 2 red signals (for the two copies of the *ERBB2* gene) and 2 green signals (for the two copies of chromosome 17). The ratio of *ERBB2* signals to CEP17 signals is $2/2 = 1.0$.\n\n*ERBB2* gene amplification is characterized by a significant increase in the copy number of the *ERBB2* gene *relative to* the copy number of its host chromosome, chromosome 17. This means we are looking for a scenario where the ratio of red signals to green signals is significantly greater than 1.0.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The majority of cells display exactly 2 red signals and 2 green signals. This pattern represents a normal, diploid cell with no amplification and no chromosomal abnormality. The ratio of red to green signals is $2/2 = 1.0$. This is the baseline for a healthy cell.\n\nB. The majority of cells display approximately 15 red signals and 2 green signals. In this case, the cell contains two copies of chromosome 17 (as indicated by the 2 green signals), but it has about 15 copies of the *ERBB2* gene (as indicated by the 15 red signals). The ratio of red to green signals is approximately $15/2 = 7.5$. This ratio is much greater than 1.0, indicating that the *ERBB2* gene has been selectively and extensively duplicated on the existing chromosomes. This is the definition of gene amplification.\n\nC. The majority of cells display 0 red signals and 2 green signals. This would indicate that the cell has two copies of chromosome 17, but both copies have lost the *ERBB2* gene locus. This represents a homozygous deletion, not amplification.\n\nD. The majority of cells display exactly 4 red signals and 4 green signals. Here, there are four copies of the *ERBB2* gene and four copies of chromosome 17. The ratio of red to green signals is $4/4 = 1.0$. This indicates that the cell has four complete copies of chromosome 17, a condition known as tetrasomy (a specific type of polysomy). While the absolute number of *ERBB2* genes is elevated, it is due to an increase in the chromosome number, not selective amplification of the gene itself. Therefore, this is evidence for polysomy, not gene amplification.\n\nE. The majority of cells display 1 red signal and 1 green signal. This would indicate that the cells are monosomic for chromosome 17, meaning they have only one copy of this chromosome. This is a chromosomal number abnormality, but not amplification.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only observation that definitively indicates *ERBB2* gene amplification is a high number of red signals paired with a normal or low number of green signals, resulting in a significantly elevated red-to-green signal ratio.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1507203"}]}
