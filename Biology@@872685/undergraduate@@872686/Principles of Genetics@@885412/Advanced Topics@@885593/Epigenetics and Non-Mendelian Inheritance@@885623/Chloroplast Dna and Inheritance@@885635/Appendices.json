{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A cornerstone of genetic analysis is the reciprocal cross, which can reveal whether a trait is passed down through nuclear genes or cytoplasmic organelles. This practice puts you in the role of a geneticist designing a definitive experiment. By using molecular markers—distinct DNA fragments that act as labels for chloroplasts from different populations—you can deduce the mode of organellar inheritance and see the principles of maternal inheritance demonstrated with clear, experimental evidence [@problem_id:1474527].", "problem": "A geneticist is investigating the inheritance of chloroplasts in a newly discovered plant species, *Ficticia undulata*. They identify two distinct populations, P1 and P2, which are morphologically identical but have a detectable polymorphism in a non-coding region of their chloroplast DNA (cpDNA). Using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to amplify this region, the geneticist finds that all plants from population P1 yield a DNA fragment of 350 base pairs (bp), while all plants from population P2 yield a fragment of 500 bp.\n\nTo determine the mode of inheritance, the geneticist performs two reciprocal crosses:\n\n1.  **Cross A**: A plant from population P1 was used as the female (ovule donor) and was crossed with a plant from population P2, which was used as the male (pollen donor).\n2.  **Cross B**: A plant from population P2 was used as the female and was crossed with a plant from population P1, which was used as the male.\n\nThe F1 progeny from both crosses were grown, and their cpDNA was analyzed using the same PCR method. The results were as follows:\n\n-   All F1 progeny from Cross A showed only the 350 bp DNA fragment.\n-   All F1 progeny from Cross B showed only the 500 bp DNA fragment.\n\nBased solely on these experimental results, what is the mode of inheritance for chloroplasts in *Ficticia undulata*?\n\nA. Paternal inheritance, where chloroplasts are inherited exclusively from the male parent.\n\nB. Biparental inheritance, where chloroplasts from both parents are contributed to the offspring.\n\nC. Maternal inheritance, where chloroplasts are inherited exclusively from the female parent.\n\nD. Mendelian inheritance, where the 350 bp allele is dominant to the 500 bp allele.\n\nE. The inheritance pattern is random and cannot be determined from the given data.", "solution": "We formalize the cpDNA marker state as a maternally informative, non-recombining cytoplasmic polymorphism whose PCR amplicon length reflects the chloroplast genotype: population P1 has a fragment of length $350$ bp, and population P2 has a fragment of length $500$ bp. In reciprocal crosses, the diagnostic pattern of cytoplasmic inheritance is inferred by whether the F1 progeny carry the cpDNA type of the female or the male parent, or both.\n\nConsider the predictions under different inheritance modes:\n- Maternal inheritance: all F1 inherit chloroplasts exclusively from the female parent; hence the F1 fragment length equals the female parent’s fragment length in each reciprocal cross.\n- Paternal inheritance: all F1 inherit chloroplasts exclusively from the male parent; hence the F1 fragment length equals the male parent’s fragment length in each reciprocal cross.\n- Biparental inheritance: both parental chloroplasts are transmitted; in F1 one would expect either detection of both $350$ and $500$ bp bands (heteroplasmy) or a variable mixture among offspring due to segregation/drift, not a uniform single band matching only one parent across all F1 in both crosses.\n- Mendelian (nuclear) inheritance with dominance: reciprocal crosses would yield the same F1 genotype distributions if nuclear, and a single-band outcome cannot be explained by nuclear dominance because the cpDNA band length is not encoded by a nuclear locus; furthermore, the reciprocal crosses give different F1 outcomes, implicating cytoplasmic (non-Mendelian) inheritance.\n\nNow compare the observations:\n- Cross A (P1 female, P2 male) yields F1 with only the $350$ bp band, which matches the female parent (P1).\n- Cross B (P2 female, P1 male) yields F1 with only the $500$ bp band, which matches the female parent (P2).\n\nThese results match exactly the prediction for maternal inheritance and contradict paternal inheritance (which would have produced the male parent’s band in each cross), biparental inheritance (which would have produced both bands or variable mixtures), and Mendelian nuclear dominance (which would not depend on the direction of the cross and does not apply to an organellar marker). Therefore, the mode of inheritance for chloroplasts in this species is maternal inheritance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1474527"}, {"introduction": "The beautiful mosaic of green and white patches on a variegated plant is a direct visualization of chloroplast genetics at work. This phenomenon arises from cells containing a mixture of functional and non-functional chloroplasts, a state known as heteroplasmy. This exercise explores how the random segregation of these mixed plastids during egg cell formation leads to a fascinating and predictable variety of offspring phenotypes, a hallmark of non-Mendelian inheritance [@problem_id:1474502].", "problem": "In the four-o'clock plant, *Mirabilis jalapa*, leaf color variegation is a well-known phenomenon. This trait is controlled by the type of plastids present in the cytoplasm of the cells. There are two types of plastids: normal chloroplasts, which are green and photosynthetically active, and mutant plastids, which are white and non-photosynthetic. The phenotype of any given plant tissue is determined by the plastids it contains. This trait exhibits a non-Mendelian inheritance pattern where the plastids are inherited exclusively through the cytoplasm of the egg cell; the pollen contributes no plastids to the zygote.\n\nConsider a flower that develops on a variegated branch, which contains a mix of green and white tissue. This flower is self-pollinated to produce seeds. Assuming the random segregation of plastids during the formation of the egg cells, which of the following choices best describes the phenotypes expected among the offspring that grow from these seeds?\n\nA. Offspring that are entirely green, offspring that are entirely white, and offspring that are variegated.\n\nB. Offspring displaying a 3:1 phenotypic ratio of green to variegated.\n\nC. Only variegated offspring, as this trait is passed on directly from the parent branch.\n\nD. A mix of green and white offspring, with the phenotype determined by the plastids contributed by the pollen.\n\nE. Only green offspring, as the white plastids represent a non-heritable somatic mutation.", "solution": "Principle: In Mirabilis jalapa, plastids are inherited cytoplasmically and maternally: the egg provides the plastids to the zygote, while pollen contributes no plastids. Therefore, the offspring phenotype depends solely on the plastid composition of the egg cell from which the zygote forms.\n\nStarting condition: A flower on a variegated branch has tissues containing a mixture of green (functional chloroplast) and white (mutant, non-photosynthetic) plastids. During ovule and egg formation, plastids segregate randomly among daughter cells.\n\nConsequence of random segregation: The eggs can become:\n- Homoplasmic green (only green plastids),\n- Homoplasmic white (only white plastids),\n- Heteroplasmic (a mixture of green and white plastids).\n\nFertilization effect: Because pollen contributes no plastids, self-pollination does not alter the plastid composition of the zygote. Thus:\n- A homoplasmic green egg yields an entirely green offspring.\n- A homoplasmic white egg yields an entirely white offspring (typically non-viable long-term but phenotypically white).\n- A heteroplasmic egg yields a variegated offspring due to sorting-out and differential proliferation of plastids during development.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A matches the three possible maternal plastid states (green, white, variegated).\n- B invokes a Mendelian 3:1 ratio, which does not apply to cytoplasmic inheritance.\n- C is incorrect because heteroplasmic eggs are not guaranteed; homoplasmic eggs can occur.\n- D is incorrect because pollen contributes no plastids; paternal plastids do not determine phenotype.\n- E is incorrect because white plastids in this context are heritable via the egg cytoplasm, not merely a non-heritable somatic mutation.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is the presence of all three phenotypes: entirely green, entirely white, and variegated offspring.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1474502"}, {"introduction": "While we often learn about maternal inheritance as an absolute rule, biology is full of fascinating exceptions. \"Paternal leakage\" is one such nuance, where a small number of chloroplasts from the male parent occasionally make their way into the zygote. This practice moves beyond qualitative predictions to a quantitative challenge, asking you to calculate the probability of a phenotypic outcome based on leakage frequency and a critical threshold for expression [@problem_id:1474513].", "problem": "In a genetic engineering program for a novel crop species, *Arabis genetica*, researchers are conducting a cross between two strains. The maternal (seed-bearing) parent is a wild-type variety that is susceptible to a potent herbicide. The paternal (pollen-donating) parent possesses a mutation in its chloroplast genome that confers complete resistance to this herbicide.\n\nInheritance of chloroplasts in this species is almost exclusively maternal. However, a phenomenon known as \"paternal leakage\" allows for the rare transmission of chloroplasts from the pollen to the zygote. Extensive studies have shown that paternal leakage occurs in 1 out of every 2,500 successful fertilization events.\n\nThe egg cell of *Arabis genetica* contains, on average, $N=200$ chloroplasts. In cases of paternal leakage, the pollen contributes a small but consistent number of $k=15$ chloroplasts to the zygote. For an F1 offspring to exhibit the herbicide-resistant phenotype, the fraction of total chloroplasts in its cells that are of paternal origin must be greater than a critical value of $0.06$.\n\nAssuming that the initial ratio of chloroplasts in the zygote is maintained in all subsequent cell divisions, calculate the probability that a randomly selected F1 offspring from this cross will be resistant to the herbicide. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "Let the probability of paternal leakage per fertilization be $p_{L}=\\frac{1}{2500}$. If no leakage occurs, the paternal chloroplast fraction in the zygote is $0$, which is less than $0.06$, so the F1 is not resistant in that case.\n\nIf leakage occurs, the maternal and paternal contributions to the zygote are $N$ and $k$ chloroplasts, respectively. The initial paternal fraction is\n$$\nf=\\frac{k}{N+k}.\n$$\nResistance requires $f>0.06$.

Therefore, an offspring is resistant if and only if paternal leakage occurs.\n\nThus, the probability that a randomly selected F1 is resistant equals the leakage probability:\n$$\nP(\\text{resistant})=p_{L}=\\frac{1}{2500}=0.0004.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, this is $0.0004000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0004000}$$", "id": "1474513"}]}
