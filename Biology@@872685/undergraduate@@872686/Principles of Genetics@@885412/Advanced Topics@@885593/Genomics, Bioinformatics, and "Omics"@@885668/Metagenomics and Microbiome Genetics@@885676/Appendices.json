Alpha diversity incorporates two main components: species richness (the number of different species present) and species evenness (the relative abundance of these species). A commonly used quantitative measure for this is the Simpson's Index of Diversity.\n\nThe Simpson's Index of Diversity is calculated as $1 - D$, where $D$ is the Simpson's Dominance Index, given by the formula:\n$$D = \\sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i^2$$\nHere, $S$ is the total number of species in the sample (richness), and $p_i$ is the proportion of the community represented by the $i$-th species.

They collect fecal samples from each patient once a week for ten consecutive weeks. From each sample, they extract bacterial DNA and perform 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify the operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which serve as proxies for bacterial species.\n\nTo compare the microbial community composition between all collected samples, they perform a beta diversity analysis using Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA). PCoA is a method used to explore and visualize dissimilarities between samples; on a PCoA plot, samples that are more similar to each other appear closer together, while samples that are more dissimilar appear farther apart.\n\nThe researchers generate two separate PCoA plots based on two different distance metrics:\n\n1.  **Unweighted UniFrac:** This metric measures the dissimilarity between two communities based only on the presence or absence of phylogenetic lineages. It is highly sensitive to the presence of rare OTUs.\n2.  **Weighted UniFrac:** This metric also incorporates the relative abundance of the phylogenetic lineages. The final distance value is therefore dominated by the most abundant OTUs in the communities.\n\nThe results are as follows:\n*   In the PCoA plot generated using the **unweighted** UniFrac metric, all 10 samples from Patient A form a tight, distinct cluster, and all 10 samples from Patient B form another tight, distinct cluster.

Unweighted UniFrac measures dissimilarity based solely on presence or absence of phylogenetic lineages and is particularly sensitive to rare OTUs. Weighted UniFrac incorporates relative abundances and is dominated by differences in the most abundant OTUs. In PCoA, tighter within-individual clustering indicates temporal stability, and separation between individuals indicates compositional differences according to the aspects emphasized by the chosen metric.\n\n2) Interpret the unweighted UniFrac result. The formation of two tight, well-separated clusters, one for each patient, under unweighted UniFrac implies that the sets of taxa present (especially rare lineages, to which this metric is highly sensitive) differ consistently between Patient A and Patient B. This indicates patient-specific presence/absence profiles, particularly among rare OTUs.\n\n3) Interpret the weighted UniFrac result. The intermingling of samples from both patients under weighted UniFrac implies that the communities are similar when considering the relative abundances of taxa, meaning the dominant (most abundant) OTUs and their abundances are largely shared across the two patients.\n\n4) Synthesize the observations. The combination of separation with unweighted (presence/absence; rare lineages) and intermingling with weighted (abundance-dominated) supports the conclusion that the most abundant taxa are shared between patients, while rare taxa differ in a patient-specific way.\n\n5) Match to the provided options.
