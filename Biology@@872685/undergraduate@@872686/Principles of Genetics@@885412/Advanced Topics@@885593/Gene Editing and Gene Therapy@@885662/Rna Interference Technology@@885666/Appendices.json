A positive control is essential for confirming that your technique is functional—that the siRNA can enter the cells and that the cellular machinery can execute the silencing command. This exercise [@problem_id:1518851] challenges you to think like an experimentalist and choose the most informative positive control to validate an RNAi setup before testing your actual gene of interest.", "problem": "A team of molecular biologists is investigating the function of a recently discovered gene, `GeneT`, within a specific line of human cancerous skin cells (melanoma cells). Their primary experimental approach is to use RNA interference (RNAi) to selectively \"knock down\" the expression of `GeneT` and observe the downstream effects on cell proliferation. To perform this, they synthesize a Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) molecule designed to be perfectly complementary to the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript of `GeneT`. Before conducting their main experiment with the anti-`GeneT` siRNA, they must first perform a control experiment to confirm that their chosen methodology is working. This validation step is crucial to ensure that the melanoma cells can be effectively transfected with siRNA and that the cells' intrinsic RNAi machinery is active and capable of mediating gene silencing.\n\nWhich one of the following would serve as the most appropriate and effective positive control for this RNAi validation experiment?\n\nA. An siRNA molecule with a scrambled nucleotide sequence that has no significant homology to any known gene in the human genome.\n\nB. The custom-synthesized siRNA molecule designed to target the mRNA of `GeneT`.\n\nC. A solution containing only the lipid-based transfection reagent that is used to deliver the siRNA into the cells, but with no siRNA molecules included.\n\nD. An siRNA molecule designed to target the mRNA of `tyrosinase` (`TYR`), an enzyme crucial for melanin pigment production which is highly expressed in melanoma cells but whose knockdown does not typically cause cell death.\n\nE. An siRNA molecule designed to target the mRNA of a universally expressed housekeeping gene, such as `Lamin A/C` (`LMNA`), whose knockdown is known to have a clear and well-documented effect of inducing cell death (apoptosis).", "solution": "The goal of a positive control in an RNAi validation experiment is to demonstrate that the experimental system can (i) successfully deliver siRNA into the cells (effective transfection) and (ii) activate the endogenous RNAi machinery to produce a predictable, measurable phenotype. An optimal positive control should therefore target a gene whose knockdown yields a robust, well-characterized, and easy-to-detect effect in the specific cell type being used.\n\nEvaluate each option with respect to these criteria:\n\nA. A scrambled siRNA with no homology to human genes is a negative control. It tests for nonspecific effects of transfection and siRNA presence, not for RNAi efficacy. It should produce no phenotype and thus is not a positive control.\n\nB. The anti-GeneT siRNA is the experimental condition itself. Without prior knowledge of its phenotype, it cannot serve as a validation control to confirm RNAi functionality or transfection efficiency.\n\nC. Transfection reagent alone (mock) is another negative control that assesses toxicity or effects of the delivery vehicle, not RNAi activity.\n\nD. An siRNA against tyrosinase (TYR), a highly expressed gene in melanoma, could reduce melanin production and thus provide a measurable phenotype if pigment readouts are feasible. However, the phenotype may be context-dependent, may require specific assays (e.g., melanin quantification), and typically does not produce a strong universal readout like cell death. This makes it less robust as a general positive control for RNAi validation across assays.\n\nE. An siRNA against a housekeeping gene such as Lamin A/C (LMNA), whose knockdown is well documented to induce apoptosis, provides a strong, reproducible, and easily observable phenotype (loss of viability, nuclear morphology changes) across many human cell types, including melanoma. This directly demonstrates effective siRNA delivery and functional RNAi machinery with a clear, robust outcome, satisfying the requirements for a positive control more effectively than the other options.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate and effective positive control is the siRNA targeting a housekeeping gene such as LMNA with a known, strong phenotype (apoptosis).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1518851"}, {"introduction": "Once an RNAi experiment is performed, the next critical step is to quantify its effect.
