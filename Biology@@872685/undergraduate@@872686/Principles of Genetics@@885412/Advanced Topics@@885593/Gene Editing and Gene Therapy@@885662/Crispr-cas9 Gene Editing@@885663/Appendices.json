Think of the gRNA as a specific GPS coordinate that directs the Cas9 enzyme to the exact location you want to edit in the vast landscape of the genome. This exercise will walk you through the fundamental rules of gRNA design, focusing on identifying a valid target site by locating the crucial Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence.

The gene's DNA sequence is provided below, with the top strand being the coding strand. The gene contains two exons and one intron. The first exon spans from nucleotide position 1 to 30, and the second exon begins at nucleotide position 61.\n\n5'- AATTGGCCTTAAGGCCTTAAGGCCTTAAGGGTACTGTACTGTACTGTACTGTACTGTACTGATTACAGATTACAGATTACAGGCTATAGCTAGCTAGCTA -3'\n3'- TTAACCGGAATTCCGGAATTCCGGAATTCCCATGACATGACATGACATGACATGACATGACCTAATGTCTAATGTCTAATGTCCTGATATCGATCGATCGAT -5'\n\nTo disrupt this gene, the biologist plans to use the CRISPR-Cas9 system from *Streptococcus pyogenes* (SpCas9). This system employs a synthetic single guide RNA (sgRNA) to direct the Cas9 nuclease to a specific location in the genome. The targeting specificity is determined by two factors: a 20-nucleotide sequence within the sgRNA and a DNA motif called the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM).\n\nThe rules for SpCas9 targeting are as follows:\n1.  The Cas9 enzyme first recognizes the PAM sequence on the DNA. For SpCas9, the PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3', where 'N' can be any of the four DNA bases (A, T, C, G).\n2.  The PAM sequence must be present on the non-template strand (the strand that is not used as a template for gRNA binding).\n3.  The 20-nucleotide target site, known as the protospacer, is the sequence on the non-template strand located immediately upstream (to the 5' side) of the PAM sequence.\n4.  The 20-nucleotide guide portion of the sgRNA must have a sequence that is complementary to the template strand at the target site. This is equivalent to saying the sgRNA sequence is identical to the protospacer sequence, with all instances of Thymine (T) replaced by Uracil (U).\n\nYour task is to design a 20-nucleotide sgRNA sequence that will direct the Cas9 nuclease to cut as close as possible to the beginning of the second exon.\n\nProvide the sequence of this 20-nucleotide guide RNA in the 5' to 3' orientation.", "solution": "We are given that the top strand is the coding strand and that exon 2 begins at nucleotide position 61. For SpCas9, the targeting rules to apply are:\n- The PAM must be 5'-NGG-3' on the non-template strand.\n- The 20-nt protospacer is immediately upstream (5' side) of the PAM on the same non-template strand.\n- The sgRNA guide sequence is identical to the protospacer sequence with all T replaced by U (RNA), and is written 5' to 3'.\n\nIndex the provided top-strand sequence and mark the exon boundary at position 61. The intron spans positions 31 to 60, so the second exon begins at position 61. We search for the nearest PAM 5'-NGG-3' on the non-template strand as close as possible to position 61. Taking the top strand as the non-template strand for a potential target, scan for NGG near position 61. In the second exon region, the first occurrence of NGG on the top strand is at positions 81–83, which is 5'-AGG-3'.\n\nBy rule, the corresponding 20-nt protospacer on the non-template (top) strand is the sequence immediately upstream of that PAM, i.e., positions 61 through 80 inclusive. Reading the top strand from position 61 to 80 gives the 20-nt protospacer:\nGATTACAGATTACAGATTAC.\n\nThis site places the protospacer starting exactly at the beginning of exon 2 (position 61), and the PAM-adjacent cut by SpCas9 would occur upstream of the PAM, keeping the cleavage close to the exon start. Checking the opposite orientation (PAM on the bottom strand), which would require a 5'-CCN-3' motif on the top strand near position 61, reveals no CCN motif close enough to yield a cut closer to position 61 than the top-strand PAM at 81–83. Therefore, the top-strand PAM at 81–83 provides the closest feasible cut to the beginning of exon 2.\n\nThe sgRNA guide sequence is identical to the protospacer with T replaced by U, written 5' to 3'.

Unintended edits at other locations, known as off-target effects, can have serious consequences, particularly in therapeutic applications. This practice challenges you to think like a seasoned researcher by evaluating the risk of off-target binding, introducing the concept of the 'seed region' which is vital for the gRNA's specificity. [@problem_id:1480232]", "problem": "A molecular biologist is planning an experiment using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system from *Streptococcus pyogenes* to functionally inactivate a gene of interest, \"Gene X\", in a human cell line. The inactivation will be achieved by introducing a double-strand break, leading to a frameshift mutation via non-homologous end joining.\n\nThe system works as follows: The Cas9 nuclease is directed to a specific 22-nucleotide DNA target sequence by a guide RNA (gRNA). The 22-nucleotide spacer region of the gRNA is complementary to one of the DNA strands (the target strand). For the Cas9 protein to bind and cleave the DNA, the target sequence must be immediately followed by a specific Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) on the non-target DNA strand. For *S. pyogenes* Cas9, the PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3', where N can be any nucleotide.\n\nThe researcher is concerned about potential \"off-target\" effects, where the gRNA-Cas9 complex might cleave an unintended location in the genome. An off-target cleavage event in an essential gene, \"Gene Y\", would be lethal to the cells. It is known that the tolerance for mismatches between the gRNA spacer and the DNA is not uniform; mismatches in the 8-10 nucleotides at the 3' end of the gRNA spacer (the \"seed region,\" which is adjacent to the PAM) are much more likely to abolish binding than mismatches located further away from the PAM.\n\nThe researcher has found a potential off-target site within the coding sequence of the essential Gene Y. The sequence of the non-target DNA strand in this region is:\n**Gene Y site:** `5'-...AGAGATTGCTAGGACATGCACC TGG...-3'`\n\nThe researcher has designed two possible gRNAs to target Gene X.

The gRNA spacer base-pairs to the opposite (target) strand and is therefore identical in sequence to the non-target protospacer (both written 5' to 3'), aside from any mismatches. Off-target risk is dominated by complementarity in the seed region, the approximately 8 to 10 nucleotides at the 3' end of the spacer adjacent to the PAM; mismatches in this seed region strongly reduce binding and cleavage, whereas mismatches far from the PAM (at the 5' end of the spacer) are more readily tolerated.\n\nIdentify the potential off-target site in Gene Y: The non-target strand given is 5'-...AGAGATTGCTAGGACATGCACC TGG...-3'. The substring 5'-TGG-3' is a valid PAM (NGG), so the sequence immediately upstream, 5'-AGAGATTGCTAGGACATGCACC-3', is the protospacer on the non-target strand. Thus, a gRNA spacer that closely matches this protospacer, especially in its 3' seed region, poses a higher off-target risk.\n\nCompare gRNA Spacer A to the Gene Y protospacer. Write both 5' to 3':\nGene Y protospacer: AGAGATTGCTAGGACATGCACC\ngRNA Spacer A:      AGAGATTGCTCGGACATGCACC\nAligning position by position from the 5' end, the two sequences match at positions 1 through 10; they differ at position 11 (Gene Y has A, Spacer A has C); and they match again at positions 12 through 22. Therefore, Spacer A has a single mismatch located outside the seed region, because the seed region corresponds to the approximately last 8 to 10 positions adjacent to the PAM (positions near the 3' end). Consequently, Spacer A exhibits perfect identity across the seed region adjacent to the PAM and only one distal mismatch, a pattern known to be compatible with efficient off-target binding and cleavage.\n\nCompare gRNA Spacer B to the Gene Y protospacer:\nGene Y protospacer: AGAGATTGCTAGGACATGCACC\ngRNA Spacer B:      TACCATTGCTAGGACAGGGGCC\nPosition-by-position comparison shows mismatches at positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (5' distal), and, critically, mismatches within the seed region near the PAM, including at positions 17, 19, and 20 (counted from the 5' end toward the PAM at the 3' end). Thus, Spacer B contains multiple mismatches in the seed region, which are expected to strongly reduce off-target binding and cleavage at this Gene Y site.\n\nGiven that the Gene Y site presents a valid PAM and that off-target lethality would occur if cleavage happens there, the poorer design is the gRNA whose spacer most closely matches the Gene Y protospacer in the seed region. Spacer A, with perfect seed complementarity and only a single non-seed mismatch, represents a substantially higher off-target risk than Spacer B, which carries multiple seed mismatches.

This can lead to a fascinating phenomenon called genetic mosaicism, where a single individual contains cells with different genotypes. This thought experiment explores the possible genetic outcomes following an *in vivo* gene editing procedure, helping you understand the distinct results of the two major DNA repair pathways: Homology-Directed Repair (HDR) and Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ).

The allele $G$ (dominant) results in grey fur, while the allele $g$ (recessive) results in white fur. To study gene function, researchers perform an *in vivo* somatic cell editing experiment. They deliver a gene editing system based on Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 directly into the mouse's tissues. The system is designed to target and modify the dominant $G$ allele.\n\nThe delivered package contains three components:\n1. The Cas9 nuclease, which creates a double-strand break in DNA.\n2. A guide RNA (gRNA) engineered to be highly specific to a sequence within the $G$ allele, leaving the $g$ allele untouched.\n3. A small, synthetic DNA donor template carrying the sequence of the $g$ allele. This template is intended to be used by the cell's Homology-Directed Repair (HDR) pathway to replace the $G$ allele with a new copy of the $g$ allele.\n\nDue to the nature of gene editing in a living organism, not all cells will be successfully edited, and among those that are, the DNA repair outcome can vary. If the double-strand break occurs but the HDR pathway is not utilized, the cell's primary alternative is the Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway. NHEJ is an error-prone process that often introduces small random insertions or deletions (indels) at the break site, which typically results in a non-functional, or \"null,\" allele.

The CRISPR-Cas9 system is designed so that the gRNA recognizes only the $G$ allele, leaving the $g$ allele uncut. After delivery, individual cells can experience different outcomes because cutting and repair occur stochastically, yielding mosaicism.\n\nPrinciple 1: If no double-strand break occurs in a given cell (Cas9 fails to cut), the genotype remains unchanged. Therefore, $Gg$ persists in some cells, matching option A.\n\nPrinciple 2: If Cas9 cuts the $G$ allele and the HDR pathway uses the supplied donor template encoding the $g$ sequence, the $G$ allele is converted to $g$. Since the $g$ allele is not targeted and remains $g$, the resulting genotype is $gg$, matching option C.\n\nPrinciple 3: If Cas9 cuts the $G$ allele but HDR is not used, repair proceeds via NHEJ, which is error-prone and typically yields a loss-of-function indel. By the problem’s definition, a null allele created from the $G$ allele is denoted $g_{null}$. With the other allele remaining $g$ (untargeted), the resulting genotype is $g_{null}g$, matching option D.\n\nExclusions based on design constraints:\n- Option B ($GG$) would require creating or preserving two $G$ alleles. The $g$ allele is not targeted for conversion to $G$, and the donor template carries $g$, not $G$, so $GG$ cannot plausibly arise.\n- Option E ($G g_{null}$) would require converting the $g$ allele into a null, but the $g$ allele is not cut by the gRNA. Moreover, $g_{null}$ is explicitly defined as arising from the $G$ allele after NHEJ, so this configuration is not plausible.\n- Option F ($g_{null}g_{null}$) would require both alleles to be cut and repaired by NHEJ, but only the $G$ allele is cut; the $g$ allele remains uncut and thus cannot become $g_{null}$ under the stated design.\n\nTherefore, the plausible genotypes present in different somatic cells of the mosaic animal are A, C, and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "1480249"}]}
