They created an F2 intercross population by mating domestic chickens (selected for large body size) with their wild ancestors, the Red Junglefowl. After measuring the body weight of hundreds of F2 individuals and genotyping them at various genetic markers, they performed a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) analysis. A QTL is a region of the genome associated with variation in a particular quantitative trait.\n\nThe strength of the association between a genomic region and the trait is measured by a Logarithm of Odds (LOD) score. A high LOD score at a specific chromosomal location suggests that a QTL is likely located there. The researchers have established a significance threshold for their study: a local peak in the LOD score of 3.0 or greater is considered significant evidence for the presence of a QTL.\n\nBelow are the LOD scores calculated at several positions along chromosome 4. The positions are given in centiMorgans (cM), a unit of genetic map distance.\n\n- Position 10 cM: LOD Score = 0.9\n- Position 35 cM: LOD Score = 2.4\n- Position 50 cM: LOD Score = 4.2\n- Position 65 cM: LOD Score = 3.1\n- Position 80 cM: LOD Score = 1.5\n- Position 105 cM: LOD Score = 1.9\n- Position 120 cM: LOD Score = 5.6\n- Position 135 cM: LOD Score = 4.0\n- Position 150 cM: LOD Score = 2.1\n- Position 165 cM: LOD Score = 1.2\n- Position 180 cM: LOD Score = 2.8\n\nBased on this data and the significance threshold, how many significant QTLs affecting body weight are located on chromosome 4, and what are their most likely positions?\n\nA.

This problem simulates how researchers use marker data to infer the mode of gene action—whether alleles have an additive effect or if one is dominant over the other. By comparing the average trait values of different genotype groups, you can deduce the underlying genetic mechanism, a key step in predicting the outcomes of genetic crosses [@problem_id:1501642].", "problem": "A plant geneticist is studying the genetic basis of fruit weight, a complex quantitative trait, in a species of Capsicum (pepper). Two true-breeding (inbred) lines are used as the parental generation (P).\n- Line A is homozygous for alleles that result in small fruit. Its genotype at a specific Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) influencing fruit weight is denoted as `q1q1`.\n- Line B is homozygous for alleles that result in large fruit. Its genotype at the same QTL is `q2q2`.\n\nA codominant molecular marker, M, has been identified that is very tightly linked to this QTL, meaning that the marker and the QTL are almost always inherited together. Line A has the marker genotype `M1M1`, and Line B has the marker genotype `M2M2`.\n\nThe geneticist crosses Line A and Line B to produce an F1 generation, and then self-pollinates individuals from the F1 generation to create a large F2 population. In the F2 population, each plant is genotyped for the marker locus (M), and their average fruit weight is measured. This allows the F2 population to be sorted into three distinct groups based on their marker genotype: `M1M1`, `M1M2`, and `M2M2`. Let $W_{11}$, $W_{12}$, and $W_{22}$ represent the mean fruit weight for F2 plants with marker genotypes `M1M1`, `M1M2`, and `M2M2`, respectively.\n\nThe geneticist wants to determine the mode of gene action at the `q` locus. Which of the following statements correctly describes the expected relationship between the mean fruit weights of the three marker classes for two different genetic scenarios?\n\n**Scenario I:** The `q` locus exhibits purely additive gene action.\n**Scenario II:** The allele for large fruit, `q2`, is completely dominant over the allele for small fruit, `q1`.\n\nA.

Scenario I: $W_{12} = (W_{11} + W_{22}) / 2$; Scenario II: $W_{12} = W_{22}$", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the phenotypic relationship (mean fruit weight) among F2 individuals grouped by their genotype at a molecular marker `M`. This marker is tightly linked to a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL), `q`, which influences fruit weight.\n\nFirst, let's establish the genotypes of the different generations.\nThe parental lines are:\n- Line A: `M1q1 / M1q1`. This line has small fruit. The mean weight corresponds to the `q1q1` genotype.\n- Line B: `M2q2 / M2q2`. This line has large fruit. The mean weight corresponds to the `q2q2` genotype.\n\nThe F1 generation is a cross between Line A and Line B, so all F1 individuals will be heterozygous: `M1q1 / M2q2`.\n\nThe F2 generation is produced by self-pollinating the F1 generation. Since the marker `M` and the QTL `q` are tightly linked, we can assume no recombination occurs between them. Therefore, the F1 individuals produce two types of gametes: `M1q1` and `M2q2`. Random fertilization of these gametes leads to the F2 genotypes in a 1:2:1 ratio:\n- 1/4 of F2 will have genotype `M1q1 / M1q1`. At the marker locus, this is genotype `M1M1`. At the QTL, this is genotype `q1q1`. The mean fruit weight for this group is $W_{11}$.\n- 2/4 of F2 will have genotype `M1q1 / M2q2`. At the marker locus, this is genotype `M1M2`. At the QTL, this is genotype `q1q2`. The mean fruit weight for this group is $W_{12}$.\n- 1/4 of F2 will have genotype `M2q2 / M2q2`. At the marker locus, this is genotype `M2M2`. At the QTL, this is genotype `q2q2`. The mean fruit weight for this group is $W_{22}$.\n\nFrom the problem description, `q1q1` results in small fruit and `q2q2` results in large fruit. Therefore, we know that $W_{11} < W_{22}$. Now we can analyze the two scenarios for the heterozygote `q1q2`.\n\n**Scenario I: Additive Gene Action**\nIn the case of purely additive gene action, the phenotype of the heterozygote is exactly intermediate between the phenotypes of the two homozygotes. The effect of each allele on the phenotype is additive. Thus, the mean fruit weight of the heterozygous `q1q2` individuals will be the arithmetic mean of the weights of the `q1q1` and `q2q2` individuals.\nThe `M1M2` marker class corresponds to the `q1q2` QTL genotype. Therefore, the mean weight $W_{12}$ will be the average of $W_{11}$ (from `q1q1`) and $W_{22}$ (from `q2q2`).\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$W_{12} = \\frac{W_{11} + W_{22}}{2}$$\n\n**Scenario II: Complete Dominance of `q2` over `q1`**\nIn the case of complete dominance, the phenotype of the heterozygote is identical to the phenotype of the dominant homozygote. The problem states that `q2` (large fruit) is completely dominant over `q1` (small fruit).\nThis means that individuals with the `q1q2` genotype will have the same phenotype (large fruit) as individuals with the `q2q2` genotype.\nThe `M1M2` marker class corresponds to the `q1q2` QTL genotype, and the `M2M2` marker class corresponds to the `q2q2` QTL genotype. Therefore, the mean weight of the `M1M2` group will be equal to the mean weight of the `M2M2` group.\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$W_{12} = W_{22}$$\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy combining the results from both scenarios, we get:\n- For Scenario I (Additive): $W_{12} = (W_{11} + W_{22}) / 2$\n- For Scenario II (Dominant `q2`): $W_{12} = W_{22}$\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA. Scenario I: $W_{12} = W_{11}$; Scenario II: $W_{12} = W_{22}$ (Incorrect for Scenario I)\nB. Scenario I: $W_{12} = (W_{11} + W_{22}) / 2$; Scenario II: $W_{12} = W_{11}$ (Incorrect for Scenario II, this would be dominance of `q1`)\nC. Scenario I: $W_{12} = W_{22}$; Scenario II: $W_{12} = (W_{11} + W_{22}) / 2$ (Incorrect, scenarios are swapped)\nD. Scenario I: $W_{12} > W_{22}$; Scenario II: $W_{12} = W_{11}$ (Incorrect for both scenarios; first part suggests overdominance)\nE. Scenario I: $W_{12} = (W_{11} + W_{22}) / 2$; Scenario II: $W_{12} = W_{22}$ (Correct for both scenarios)\n\nThus, option E correctly describes the expected relationships for both scenarios.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1501642"}, {"introduction": "Effective QTL mapping requires careful planning and strategic experimental design.
