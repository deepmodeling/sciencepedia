Its most significant consequence is a predictable decrease in the frequency of heterozygous individuals compared to the expectations of the Hardy-Weinberg principle. This first exercise [@problem_id:1498636] provides a direct application of this concept, allowing you to calculate the expected heterozygote frequency in a population with a known level of inbreeding.", "problem": "In a remote island ecosystem, conservation biologists are monitoring a small, isolated population of the Crimson-Eared Finch. They are concerned about the effects of inbreeding on the genetic diversity of this endangered species. Their research focuses on a specific gene locus that influences immune response. This locus has two alleles, a dominant allele `R` and a recessive allele `r`.\n\nFrom extensive genetic sampling, the biologists have determined that the frequency of the dominant allele `R` is $p = 0.80$ and the frequency of the recessive allele `r` is $q = 0.20$. Due to the population's isolation, a significant level of inbreeding occurs. The average inbreeding coefficient ($F$) for this population has been estimated to be $0.25$.\n\nCalculate the expected frequency of heterozygous individuals (`Rr`) in this population, taking into account the effects of inbreeding.

Let allele frequencies be $p$ for $R$ and $q$ for $r$, with $p+q=1$, and let the inbreeding coefficient be $F$.\n\nUnder random mating (Hardy–Weinberg), the heterozygote frequency is $2pq$. Inbreeding reduces heterozygosity by a factor of $(1-F)$, yielding the standard result\n$$\nP(Rr)=2pq(1-F).\n$$\nThis follows from the partition of genotypes into those formed by alleles identical by descent (with probability $F$, which can only form homozygotes) and those formed by independent sampling (with probability $1-F$, which follows Hardy–Weinberg proportions).\n\nSubstitute the given values $p=0.80$, $q=0.20$, and $F=0.25$:\n$$\nP(Rr)=2(0.80)(0.20)\\bigl(1-0.25\\bigr)=0.32\\times 0.75=0.24.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $0.240$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.240}$$", "id": "1498636"}, {"introduction": "Now that we understand how the inbreeding coefficient ($F$) influences genotype frequencies, the next essential skill is to calculate it from a pedigree. The value of $F$ for an individual is determined by the degree of relationship between its parents, which can be traced through common ancestors.

In one generation, two siblings from Family A, a brother and a sister, marry two siblings from Family B, a sister and a brother, respectively. The first couple produces a child, named Child 1. The second couple produces a child, named Child 2. These two children, who are known as double first cousins, later marry and have a child of their own, designated as Individual X.\n\nYou are given that the four founding grandparents (the parents of the siblings in Family A and the parents of the siblings in Family B) are all non-inbred and entirely unrelated to one another.\n\nYour task is to determine the probability that for any single genetic locus, the two alleles present in Individual X are identical by descent.

The parents of Individual X are double first cousins (Child 1 and Child 2), and therefore their common ancestors are exactly the four founders $A_{1}, A_{2}, B_{1}, B_{2}$.\n\nThe inbreeding coefficient of Individual X equals the kinship coefficient between the parents. Using the standard path-counting formula for the inbreeding coefficient via common ancestors,\n$$\nF_{X}=\\sum_{k}(1/2)^{n_{1}(k)+n_{2}(k)+1}\\left(1+F_{k}\\right),\n$$\nwhere the sum runs over all common ancestors $k$ of the parents, $n_{1}(k)$ and $n_{2}(k)$ are the number of meioses from $k$ to each parent, and $F_{k}$ is the inbreeding coefficient of ancestor $k$.\n\nHere, for each of the four founders $k\\in\\{A_{1},A_{2},B_{1},B_{2}\\}$, we have $F_{k}=0$ (founders are non-inbred) and $n_{1}(k)=2$, $n_{2}(k)=2$ (grandparent to parent to the focal parent on each side).
