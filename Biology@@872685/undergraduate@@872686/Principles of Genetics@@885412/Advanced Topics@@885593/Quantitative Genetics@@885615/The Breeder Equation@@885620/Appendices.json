Marbling is assessed on a quantitative scale. The current generation of the entire herd has an average marbling score of 5.00 units. From this herd, a select group of bulls and cows are chosen for breeding. This selected group has a much higher average marbling score of 5.50 units.

This practice challenges you to rearrange the Breeder's Equation to solve for narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$).

From this population, the engineers select the top-performing individuals to be the parents of the next generation. The mean lipid content of this selected group of parents is 45.0%. After allowing these selected parents to reproduce, the resulting offspring generation is found to have a mean lipid content of 31.0%.\n\nAssuming the change in lipid content is due to this artificial selection process, calculate the narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$) for lipid content in this algal population.

You will first calculate narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$) from its fundamental components—additive genetic variance ($V_A$) and total phenotypic variance ($V_P$). You will then apply the Breeder's Equation iteratively to predict the cumulative change over several generations, under the simplifying assumption that heritability and the selection differential remain constant.
