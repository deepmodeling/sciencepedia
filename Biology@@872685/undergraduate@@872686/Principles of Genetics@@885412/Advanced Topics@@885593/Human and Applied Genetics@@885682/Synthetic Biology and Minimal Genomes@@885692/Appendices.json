They are using the Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) cycle, a fundamental iterative process in engineering biology.\n\n*   **Design:** The team designed a metabolic pathway introducing three enzymes (A, B, and C) intended to convert a native *E. coli* metabolite into vanillin. The planned sequence is: Native Metabolite $\\xrightarrow{\\text{Enzyme A}}$ Intermediate 1 $\\xrightarrow{\\text{Enzyme B}}$ Protocatechuic Acid $\\xrightarrow{\\text{Enzyme C}}$ Vanillin.\n*   **Build:** They successfully synthesized the genes for enzymes A, B, and C, assembled them into a plasmid, and transformed the plasmid into an *E. coli* host strain.\n*   **Test:** The engineered bacteria were cultured in a growth medium that should induce the expression of the new enzymes. The team observed that the cell culture grew poorly and then lysed (burst). Chemical analysis of the culture supernatant revealed a high concentration of protocatechuic acid, but no detectable vanillin. Further research confirms that protocatechuic acid is toxic to *E. coli* at the concentrations measured.\n\nBased on these observations, the results from which phase of the DBTL cycle revealed the critical flaw in the engineered system, and what is the immediate next phase the team should enter to address the problem?\n\nA.

During Design, the pathway architecture was proposed, but no empirical flaw can be revealed without implementation and measurement. During Build, the genes were synthesized, assembled, and transformed; successful construction does not expose functional toxicity or pathway bottlenecks by itself. During Test, the engineered cells were induced and phenotypic and chemical measurements were made. The observed poor growth, lysis, and chemical profile showing accumulation of protocatechuic acid with no vanillin directly reveal a functional flaw: the pathway stalls at the step catalyzed by Enzyme C, causing buildup of a toxic intermediate. This flaw is an empirical outcome of testing. By definition of the DBTL cycle order (Design → Build → Test → Learn), the immediate next phase after Test is Learn, where results are analyzed to generate hypotheses (e.g., Enzyme C expression/activity is insufficient; cofactor or transport limitations; need to mitigate intermediate toxicity) that inform a revised design for the next iteration. Therefore, the Test phase revealed the flaw, and the next phase should be Learn.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1524586"}, {"introduction": "A central goal in synthetic biology is the creation of a 'minimal genome'—a streamlined cellular chassis containing only the essential genetic parts for life under defined conditions. This practice introduces transposon mutagenesis, a powerful experimental technique used to functionally map an entire genome for non-essential genes [@problem_id:1524622]. By analyzing the results of a large-scale screen, you will learn how raw genomic data is translated into a functional classification of genes, a critical first step in any genome minimization project.", "problem": "A research team in synthetic biology is working to engineer a minimal genome for a novel bacterium, *Bacillus syntheticus*, which currently has a genome containing 4,100 distinct protein-coding genes. Their goal is to identify all non-essential genes that can be removed without compromising the organism's viability on a specific rich nutrient medium.\n\nTo achieve this, they employ a technique called transposon mutagenesis. They introduce a transposon, which carries a gene for kanamycin resistance, into a large population of *B. syntheticus*. The transposon inserts itself quasi-randomly into the bacterial chromosome. The entire bacterial population is then grown on the rich nutrient medium supplemented with kanamycin. Only cells that have successfully incorporated a transposon can survive this selection.\n\nAfter cultivation, the researchers collect millions of surviving cells and use high-throughput sequencing to identify the precise genomic location of the transposon insertion in each cell. By compiling the data from the entire surviving population, they find that the transposon had inserted into and disrupted a total of 3,280 different protein-coding genes. Each of these 3,280 genes was disrupted in at least one surviving bacterium.\n\nBased on the results of this large-scale screen, calculate the proportion of protein-coding genes in *B. syntheticus* that are considered non-essential under these specific growth conditions.

This advanced problem challenges you to quantitatively model a genetic AND gate, a fundamental building block of biological computation, constructed using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) technology [@problem_id:1524604]. Mastering this calculation demonstrates your ability to connect molecular parameters, like binding affinities, to the emergent, systems-level behavior of an engineered genetic device.", "problem": "A synthetic biology team is engineering a genetic circuit in *Escherichia coli* to act as a three-input AND gate for transcriptional control. The system uses the CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) mechanism. The core components of the circuit are as follows:\n\n1.  A gene encoding a deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) protein is expressed constitutively at a high, non-limiting level.\n2.  A reporter gene encoding Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) is placed under the control of a constitutive promoter, `P_const`.\n3.  Downstream of `P_const` but upstream of the GFP coding sequence, an engineered operator region has been inserted. This operator contains three unique, non-overlapping, and contiguous target sites, `S_A`, `S_B`, and `S_C`.\n4.  Three genes encoding specific guide RNAs (gRNAs) — `gRNA_A`, `gRNA_B`, and `gRNA_C` — are designed to direct the dCas9 protein to the target sites `S_A`, `S_B`, and `S_C`, respectively. The expression of each gRNA is controlled by a distinct inducible promoter, activated by small molecules `I_A`, `I_B`, and `I_C`.\n\nThe binding of a dCas9:gRNA complex to its target site sterically blocks transcription. The design of the AND gate is such that significant repression of GFP expression is achieved **only** when all three sites (`S_A`, `S_B`, and `S_C`) are simultaneously occupied by their corresponding dCas9:gRNA complexes. If one or two sites are occupied, the level of GFP expression is assumed to be indistinguishable from the fully unrepressed state.\n\nFrom experimental characterization, the following parameters are known:\n-   In the presence of a saturating concentration of its respective inducer, the steady-state intracellular concentration of each active dCas9:gRNA complex (`C_A`, `C_B`, or `C_C`) is `500` nM. In the absence of an inducer, the corresponding complex concentration is zero.\n-   The binding of each complex `C_k` to its site `S_k` is an independent equilibrium process described by a dissociation constant, `K_D`. For simplicity, all three sites have been engineered to have an identical `K_D` of `10.0` nM.\n-   The fully repressed state (all three sites occupied) still allows for a small amount of basal \"leaky\" expression. This expression level, `E_rep`, is 1% of the fully unrepressed expression level, `E_unrep`. That is, `E_rep = 0.01 \\times E_unrep`.\n\nCalculate the fold-repression of the circuit when all three inducers (`I_A`, `I_B`, and `I_C`) are added at saturating concentrations. The fold-repression is defined as the ratio of the GFP expression level in the absence of all inducers to the GFP expression level in the presence of all inducers. Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The fraction of time a single target site is occupied by its cognate dCas9:gRNA complex at equilibrium is given by the standard ligand-binding isotherm\n$$\np=\\frac{C}{C+K_{D}},\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the free complex concentration and $K_{D}$ is the dissociation constant. With all three inducers saturating, each complex concentration is $C=500$ nM and each site has $K_{D}=10$ nM, so\n$$\np=\\frac{500}{500+10}=\\frac{50}{51}.\n$$\nAssuming independent binding to the three non-overlapping sites, the probability that all three sites are simultaneously occupied is\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{all}}=p^{3}=\\left(\\frac{50}{51}\\right)^{3}=\\frac{125000}{132651}.\n$$\nBy design, expression is unrepressed unless all three sites are occupied.
