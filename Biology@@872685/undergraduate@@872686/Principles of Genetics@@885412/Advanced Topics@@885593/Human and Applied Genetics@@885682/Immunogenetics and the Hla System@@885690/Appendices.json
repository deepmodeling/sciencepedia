Because the major HLA genes are clustered together on chromosome 6, they are typically passed down from parent to child as a single unit, or haplotype.

Mastering this concept is the first step in appreciating why finding a suitable organ donor can be a challenge even within families.", "problem": "The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system is a critical group of genes located on chromosome 6 that play a central role in the immune system's ability to recognize self versus non-self tissues. For organ transplantation, the matching of HLA antigens between donor and recipient is paramount to prevent rejection. The major HLA genes (e.g., HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DR) are situated very close to each other and are typically inherited from a parent as a single, linked block of genes known as a haplotype.\n\nConsider a family where the parents are genetically unrelated. The father possesses two distinct HLA haplotypes, which we will denote as P1 and P2. The mother also possesses two distinct HLA haplotypes, M1 and M2, which are different from both P1 and P2. Each child inherits exactly one haplotype from the father and one from the mother.\n\nSuppose this couple has two children. Based on the principles of Mendelian inheritance and assuming no genetic recombination occurs within the HLA gene complex, what are the respective probabilities that the second sibling will be a zero-haplotype match, a one-haplotype match, and a two-haplotype match with the first sibling?\n\nA. The probability of a zero-match is 1/4, a one-haplotype match is 1/2, and a two-haplotype match is 1/4.\n\nB. The probability of a zero-match is 1/3, a one-haplotype match is 1/3, and a two-haplotype match is 1/3.\n\nC. The probability of a zero-match is 1/2, a one-haplotype match is 1/4, and a two-haplotype match is 1/4.\n\nD. A zero-haplotype match between full siblings is genetically impossible, so the probability is 0.\n\nE. The probability of a zero-match is 1/8, a one-haplotype match is 3/4, and a two-haplotype match is 1/8.", "solution": "Assume no recombination within the HLA complex, so each child inherits exactly one intact haplotype from the father and one from the mother. Let the father’s haplotypes be $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$, and the mother’s haplotypes be $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$, all distinct. For each parent, transmission to each child is an independent fair choice between the two haplotypes by Mendelian segregation.\n\nLet $F_{i}\\in\\{P_{1},P_{2}\\}$ denote the paternal haplotype inherited by child $i$, and $M_{i}\\in\\{M_{1},M_{2}\\}$ the maternal haplotype. For siblings 1 and 2, define indicator variables for sharing paternal and maternal haplotypes:\n$$\nX_{p}=\\mathbf{1}\\{F_{1}=F_{2}\\},\\qquad X_{m}=\\mathbf{1}\\{M_{1}=M_{2}\\}.\n$$\nBy Mendelian segregation, $\\mathbb{P}(F_{2}=F_{1})=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\mathbb{P}(M_{2}=M_{1})=\\frac{1}{2}$, so $X_{p}\\sim\\text{Bernoulli}\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ and $X_{m}\\sim\\text{Bernoulli}\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$. Paternal and maternal transmissions are independent, hence $X_{p}$ and $X_{m}$ are independent.\n\nThe number of shared haplotypes is\n$$\nS=X_{p}+X_{m}\\in\\{0,1,2\\}.\n$$\nTherefore $S$ has the $\\text{Binomial}(2,\\frac{1}{2})$ distribution:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(S=2)=\\mathbb{P}(X_{p}=1)\\mathbb{P}(X_{m}=1)=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{4},\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(S=1)=\\mathbb{P}(X_{p}=1,X_{m}=0)+\\mathbb{P}(X_{p}=0,X_{m}=1)=2\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{2},\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(S=0)=\\mathbb{P}(X_{p}=0)\\mathbb{P}(X_{m}=0)=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nThus the probabilities for zero-, one-, and two-haplotype matches are $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{2}$, and $\\frac{1}{4}$, respectively, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1498367"}, {"introduction": "Moving from inheritance to molecular function, we explore what makes the HLA system so specific. An HLA molecule's primary job is to bind and present short protein fragments, called peptides, to T-cells. However, this binding is highly selective, akin to a lock and key. This practice [@problem_id:1498357] provides a simplified model that mimics how immunologists predict peptide binding, focusing on critical \"anchor residues\" that determine affinity. By scoring potential viral peptides, you will gain a hands-on understanding of the molecular basis for antigen presentation, which is central to how our bodies recognize and fight infection.", "problem": "In human immunology, cell-surface proteins encoded by the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), known as Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA), play a crucial role in the adaptive immune response. MHC class I molecules survey a cell's internal protein content by binding to short peptides derived from intracellular proteins. If the peptide originates from a virus, the MHC-peptide complex is displayed on the cell surface, flagging the infected cell for destruction by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.\n\nThe binding affinity of a peptide to a specific HLA allele is determined by 'anchor' residues within the peptide that fit into pockets of the HLA binding groove. For this problem, consider the HLA-B*27:05 allele and its interactions with viral nonapeptides (peptides of 9 amino acids in length, with positions designated P1 through P9 from the N-terminus to the C-terminus).\n\nThe binding affinity can be estimated using a simplified scoring model. The total binding score for a peptide is the sum of the scores from individual amino acid positions according to the following rules. A higher total score correlates with stronger predicted binding.\n\n**Scoring Rules for HLA-B*27:05:**\n1.  **Primary Anchor (P2):** An Arginine (R) at this position contributes +10 to the score.

Neutrophils", "solution": "We identify the molecular defect: Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome Type II is characterized by an absence of HLA class II expression on professional antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, while HLA class I expression is normal.\n\nWe apply the core principles of antigen presentation:\n- HLA class II molecules present exogenous peptides to $CD4^{+}$ helper T lymphocytes. Activation of $CD4^{+}$ T cells requires T cell receptor recognition of a peptide–HLA class II complex plus costimulation; without HLA class II on APCs, this signal cannot occur, so $CD4^{+}$ T cells cannot be activated.\n- HLA class I molecules present endogenous peptides to $CD8^{+}$ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In this scenario, HLA class I expression and function are normal, so $CD8^{+}$ T cells can still receive their antigen-specific activation signal, though optimal priming and memory may be impaired due to absent $CD4^{+}$ T cell help; this is an indirect effect, not a fundamental inability of $CD8^{+}$ T cells to be activated by HLA class I.\n- Natural killer cells do not require HLA class II for activation; they are regulated largely by the presence or absence of HLA class I and other ligands. With normal HLA class I, NK cell regulation is not directly compromised by the lack of HLA class II.\n- Plasma cells arise from B cells; T-dependent antibody responses require $CD4^{+}$ T cell help (e.g., CD40L–CD40 interactions and cytokines), so class switching and affinity maturation are severely impaired. However, B cells can still respond to T-independent antigens and differentiate into IgM-secreting plasma cells; thus plasma cells are not intrinsically unable to function, but are indirectly affected.\n- Neutrophils are innate effector cells whose activation and function do not depend on HLA class II; they are not directly affected by this defect.\n\nTherefore, the cell population most directly and fundamentally unable to be activated and perform its primary function in the absence of HLA class II is the $CD4^{+}$ helper T lymphocytes.\n\nThere is no mistake in the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1498377"}]}
