This first exercise challenges you to think like a molecular biochemist, focusing on the precise chemical requirements for attaching a ubiquitin tag to a target protein. By considering the consequences of mutating key amino acid residues, you will develop a deeper appreciation for the molecular specificity that is essential for this entire process [@problem_id:2332487].", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the regulation of a specific transcription factor, Protein T. Experimental evidence has shown that the intracellular concentration of Protein T is tightly controlled, and its degradation is mediated exclusively by the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS). In the critical step of this process, ubiquitin molecules are attached to the target protein, marking it for destruction by the proteasome.\n\nTo study this pathway in detail, the researcher uses genetic engineering to create a mutant version of Protein T. In this mutant form, every single lysine (Lys) residue in the protein's amino acid sequence has been replaced by an arginine (Arg) residue. The overall three-dimensional structure of the protein is confirmed to be unchanged by this set of mutations. The researcher then compares the stability of the wild-type Protein T and the mutant Protein T within living cells.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes is the most likely observation?\n\nA. The mutant Protein T is degraded at a rate identical to the wild-type protein, because arginine is also a basic, positively charged amino acid like lysine.\n\nB. The mutant Protein T is degraded more rapidly than the wild-type protein because the proteasome has a higher affinity for arginine-rich sequences.\n\nC. The mutant Protein T displays significantly increased stability (i.e., it is degraded much more slowly) compared to the wild-type protein.\n\nD. The degradation rate is unaffected, but the mutant Protein T is now degraded by lysosomal autophagy instead of the proteasome.\n\nE. The mutant Protein T gets ubiquitinated on its N-terminal amino group, leading to a normal rate of degradation.", "solution": "The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) targets proteins for degradation by covalently attaching ubiquitin to specific sites on substrate proteins, followed by proteasomal recognition of polyubiquitin chains. The key biochemical step is formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal carboxyl group of ubiquitin (specifically Gly76) and the epsilon-amino group of a lysine side chain on the substrate. This reaction is catalyzed by the concerted action of E1 (activating), E2 (conjugating), and E3 (ligase) enzymes, with E3 conferring substrate specificity and positioning a substrate lysine for ubiquitin transfer. Subsequent ubiquitin molecules are typically linked via lysine residues on ubiquitin (such as K48) to build a polyubiquitin chain that is recognized by the proteasome.\n\nReplacing all lysine residues in the substrate with arginine preserves overall positive charge and can preserve structure, but it removes the epsilon-amino groups required for isopeptide bond formation to the substrate. Arginine’s guanidinium group cannot serve as a nucleophile to form the requisite isopeptide linkage with ubiquitin’s C-terminus. Therefore, canonical lysine-directed ubiquitination on the substrate is abolished.\n\nWithout efficient substrate ubiquitination and polyubiquitin chain assembly, the proteasome will not recognize and degrade the protein at the normal rate. Although non-lysine ubiquitination (for example, on the N-terminal alpha-amino group or on serine, threonine, or cysteine residues) can occur in certain contexts, these alternatives are less common and typically require specific ligases and signals; they do not generally restore a normal degradation rate when all lysines are removed. Hence, the most likely observation is a marked increase in stability of the mutant protein relative to wild type.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because matching charge does not provide the correct nucleophilic functional group for isopeptide bond formation.\n- B is incorrect because proteasomal recognition depends on polyubiquitin tags, not intrinsic affinity for arginine-rich sequences.\n- C is correct: loss of lysine residues prevents normal ubiquitination and proteasomal targeting, increasing stability.\n- D is incorrect: there is no basis for a switch to lysosomal autophagy solely due to Lys→Arg substitutions.\n- E is not the most likely outcome: N-terminal ubiquitination can occur but is not generally sufficient to maintain a normal degradation rate in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is significantly increased stability of the mutant Protein T.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2332487"}, {"introduction": "Protein degradation is not a random event; it is a tightly regulated process critical for cellular function, such as controlling the cell cycle. Building on the chemical basis of ubiquitination, this problem explores how cells control *when* a protein is marked for destruction. You will investigate how a post-translational modification, phosphorylation, can act as a specific signal to create a recognizable degradation motif, or \"degron,\" thereby ensuring proteins are destroyed only at the appropriate time [@problem_id:1515118].", "problem": "In a eukaryotic cell, the concentration of a critical cell cycle regulatory protein, named Cyclin-X, must be tightly controlled. Its timely destruction is essential for the cell to exit mitosis and enter the next phase of the cell cycle. This degradation is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The process begins when a specific kinase phosphorylates a serine residue at position 85 (Ser-85) of Cyclin-X. This phosphorylation event creates a recognition site, known as a degron, that is bound by a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme. The E3 ligase then attaches a chain of ubiquitin molecules to Cyclin-X, marking it for rapid degradation by the proteasome.\n\nA researcher creates a mutant cell line where the gene encoding Cyclin-X has been altered. The mutation changes the codon for the serine at position 85 into a codon for alanine (Ala). Assuming this Ser-85 to Ala mutation does not otherwise affect the protein's folding or its primary function as a cell cycle regulator, what is the most likely consequence for the half-life of the mutant Cyclin-X protein compared to the wild-type protein?\n\nA. The half-life of the mutant Cyclin-X protein will decrease significantly because alanine is a signal for immediate degradation.\n\nB. The half-life of the mutant Cyclin-X protein will increase significantly because its primary degradation signal cannot be generated.\n\nC. The half-life of the mutant Cyclin-X protein will remain unchanged because the proteasome can still recognize the protein.\n\nD. The half-life of the mutant Cyclin-X protein will become zero as the mutation causes the protein to be non-functional and it is immediately cleared.\n\nE. The half-life of the mutant Cyclin-X protein will fluctuate randomly because the regulatory system is now unstable.", "solution": "We analyze the degradation pathway described: Cyclin-X is targeted for proteasomal degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, with a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase recognizing a degron that is created only after phosphorylation of Ser-85 by a kinase. Thus, phosphorylation at Ser-85 is a prerequisite for E3 ligase binding and subsequent ubiquitination.\n\nKey biochemical principle: phosphorylation-dependent degron formation. A serine residue can be phosphorylated due to its hydroxyl side chain, creating a phospho-degron recognized by certain E3 ligases (for example, SCF complexes use phospho-degrons). Alanine lacks a hydroxyl group and therefore cannot be phosphorylated, so a Ser-to-Ala mutation at position 85 would prevent formation of the phospho-degron.\n\nConsequence for ubiquitination: Without the phospho-degron, the specific E3 ligase cannot bind effectively, so the rate of ubiquitin chain attachment to Cyclin-X is strongly reduced. In turn, targeting to the proteasome is diminished.\n\nKinetic consequence for half-life: If protein degradation follows first-order kinetics with degradation rate constant $k_{\\text{deg}}$, the half-life is\n$$\nt_{1/2}=\\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\text{deg}}}.\n$$\nIn the wild type, phosphorylation enables rapid E3 binding and ubiquitination, giving a relatively large $k_{\\text{deg,WT}}$ and therefore a shorter $t_{1/2,\\text{WT}}=\\ln(2)/k_{\\text{deg,WT}}$. In the S85A mutant, loss of the phospho-degron reduces E3 binding and ubiquitination, decreasing the effective degradation rate constant to $k_{\\text{deg,mut}}<k_{\\text{deg,WT}}$. Therefore,\n$$\nt_{1/2,\\text{mut}}=\\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\text{deg,mut}}}>\\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\text{deg,WT}}}=t_{1/2,\\text{WT}}.\n$$\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect: alanine is not a signal for immediate degradation.\n- B is correct: the primary degradation signal (phospho-degron) cannot be generated, stabilizing the protein and increasing its half-life.\n- C is incorrect: the proteasome does not recognize unmodified Cyclin-X directly; ubiquitination is required.\n- D is incorrect: the mutation does not imply immediate clearance or zero half-life, nor does it necessarily abolish primary function as stated.\n- E is incorrect: the regulatory outcome is not random; loss of the degron predictably stabilizes the protein.\n\nTherefore, the half-life of the mutant Cyclin-X will increase significantly.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1515118"}, {"introduction": "Moving from foundational principles to experimental practice, a key skill for any cell biologist is designing experiments and interpreting data to elucidate molecular pathways.
