They observe that while the gene's promoter is active and transcription proceeds at a normal rate, the cellular concentration of the final enzyme is drastically lower than expected. Further analysis of the messenger RNA (mRNA) in the cytoplasm reveals that the transcripts are unstable and degraded much more rapidly than their wild-type counterparts. Upon sequencing the gene and its transcripts, the biologist discovers a single point mutation in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR). The canonical AAUAAA sequence, which is normally found near the end of the transcript, has been mutated to AAGAAA.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most direct and accurate molecular explanation for the observed low enzyme levels?\n\nA. The mutation creates a new binding site for microRNA (miRNA), leading to the targeted destruction of the mRNA transcript.\n\nB. The mutation prevents the proper termination of transcription by RNA Polymerase II, resulting in an excessively long and non-functional transcript that is immediately degraded.\n\nC. The mutation alters the Kozak consensus sequence, which significantly reduces the efficiency of translation initiation by the ribosome.\n\nD. The mutation impairs the binding of the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF), leading to failed 3' end cleavage and the absence of a protective poly-A tail.\n\nE. The mutation disrupts an exonic splicing enhancer, causing the spliceosome to incorrectly remove an essential exon from the pre-mRNA.", "solution": "The canonical sequence 5'-AAUAAA-3' in the 3' UTR is the polyadenylation signal that is specifically recognized by the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF). This recognition is essential for two tightly coupled steps: (i) endonucleolytic cleavage of the pre-mRNA at a defined site downstream of the signal, and (ii) subsequent addition of the poly-A tail by poly(A) polymerase, which is stabilized by poly(A)-binding proteins.\n\nStep 1: Identify the key regulatory element affected.\nThe reported single-nucleotide change from AAUAAA to AAGAAA occurs within the canonical polyadenylation signal. AAUAAA is the optimal CPSF-binding motif; substitutions in this hexamer markedly reduce CPSF affinity and thereby impair 3' end processing.\n\nStep 2: Deduce the molecular consequence of impaired CPSF binding.\nIf CPSF cannot bind efficiently, the pre-mRNA fails to undergo proper 3' end cleavage. Without this cleavage, the poly(A) polymerase cannot add the poly-A tail at the correct site, resulting in transcripts that lack or have severely compromised polyadenylation.\n\nStep 3: Connect loss of poly-A tail to mRNA instability and reduced protein.\nThe poly-A tail, bound by cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding proteins, protects the mRNA from rapid exonucleolytic decay and promotes translation initiation via the closed-loop interaction with the cap-binding complex. Absence or severe reduction of the poly-A tail leads to rapid deadenylation-independent decay and poor translation, yielding low cellular levels of the encoded enzyme despite normal promoter activity and transcription rate.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate alternatives to ensure the most direct and accurate explanation.\n- Option A (miRNA site creation) is speculative and not directly supported by the specific AAUAAA to AAGAAA change; miRNA targeting requires specific seed matches and auxiliary features, and the problem highlights the loss of the canonical polyadenylation signal.\n- Option B (termination failure) can be a secondary consequence of failed cleavage, but the most direct cause of cytoplasmic instability and low protein is the absence of a protective poly-A tail due to failed 3' end processing, not merely elongated transcripts.\n- Option C (Kozak sequence) pertains to the 5' UTR near the start codon, not the 3' UTR; it does not explain instability.\n- Option E (exonic splicing enhancer) concerns splicing regulation within exons; while the 3' UTR lies within the last exon, the specific functional element affected here is the polyadenylation signal, not an ESE.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and accurate molecular explanation is impaired CPSF binding causing failed 3' end cleavage and absence of a protective poly-A tail, leading to unstable mRNA and low enzyme levels.\n\nThe correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1467288"}, {"introduction": "The cell's genetic grammar is powerful but can be subverted by even a single mutation, leading to unexpected outcomes. This exercise [@problem_id:1467246] presents a scenario where a polyadenylation signal arises in a novel location—an internal exon. Solving this puzzle will challenge you to predict the dramatic consequences for the final protein, illustrating the important concept of alternative polyadenylation and its role in generating protein diversity or disease.", "problem": "A hypothetical eukaryotic gene, named *REG1*, is crucial for cellular metabolism. The *REG1* gene contains three exons and two introns. The start codon (AUG) is located in Exon 1, and the normal stop codon and the canonical polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) are located in Exon 3.\n\nA research team discovers a new allele of this gene containing a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). A single base-pair change has occurred within the coding region of Exon 2. This specific mutation has changed a pre-existing nucleotide sequence into a new, fully functional AAUAAA polyadenylation signal. Assume the cell's processing machinery recognizes and acts upon this newly created signal.\n\nWhat is the most likely primary structure of the protein product translated from the messenger RNA (mRNA) produced by this mutant *REG1* allele?\n\nA. A full-length REG1 protein, but with a single amino acid substitution corresponding to the site of the SNP.\n\nB. A full-length REG1 protein identical to the wild-type protein.\n\nC. A protein product where the amino acid sequence corresponding to Exon 2 has been spliced out, resulting in a fusion of the peptides from Exon 1 and Exon 3.\n\nD. A truncated protein that contains the amino acid sequence from Exon 1 and a portion of Exon 2, but lacks the sequences from the rest of Exon 2 and all of Exon 3.\n\nE. No protein product is formed because the mutation leads to the complete and immediate degradation of the pre-mRNA transcript.", "solution": "The canonical 3' end processing of a eukaryotic pre-mRNA requires recognition of a polyadenylation signal, typically AAUAAA, by cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factors. Recognition of AAUAAA leads to endonucleolytic cleavage approximately 10–30 nucleotides downstream, addition of a poly(A) tail by poly(A) polymerase, and transcription termination downstream of the cleavage site. The location of the functional polyadenylation signal thus defines the mature mRNA’s 3' end.\n\nIn the wild-type *REG1* gene, the start codon (AUG) is in Exon 1, and both the normal stop codon and the canonical polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) are in Exon 3. Therefore, the mature mRNA contains Exons 1, 2, and 3 joined by correct splicing, and translation yields the full-length REG1 protein.\n\nIn the mutant allele, a single nucleotide change within the coding region of Exon 2 creates a functional AAUAAA polyadenylation signal. By the problem’s assumption, the processing machinery recognizes and acts on this ectopic signal. Consequently:\n- Cleavage and polyadenylation occur within Exon 2, upstream of the normal Exon 3 AAUAAA and stop codon.\n- The pre-mRNA is cleaved within Exon 2, so sequences downstream of the cleavage site (the remainder of Exon 2, Intron 2, and all of Exon 3) are not included in the mature mRNA.\n- Upstream splicing (removal of Intron 1) can still occur, producing an mRNA composed of Exon 1 followed by only the 5' portion of Exon 2 up to the cleavage site, ending with a poly(A) tail.\n\nTranslation initiates at the AUG in Exon 1 as usual and proceeds into Exon 2. Because the normal stop codon in Exon 3 is absent from this shortened mRNA, translation cannot reach that stop codon. Practical outcomes of lacking a proper stop codon include truncated translation at or near the new 3' end and potential nonstop decay; in any case, the encoded polypeptide lacks the remainder of Exon 2 and all of Exon 3 sequences. Among the provided options, this corresponds to a truncated protein containing the amino acid sequence from Exon 1 and a portion of Exon 2, but lacking the rest of Exon 2 and all of Exon 3.\n\nTherefore, the most likely primary structure is described by option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1467246"}, {"introduction": "Beyond understanding how mRNA is made, it's crucial to learn how scientists measure its lifecycle in the lab.
