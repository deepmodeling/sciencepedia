To appreciate this, we can build a simple model that accounts for the energetic cost, measured in high-energy phosphate bonds, for each stage of translation. This exercise challenges you to calculate and compare the energetic efficiency of synthesizing proteins of different lengths, revealing how fixed costs and variable costs contribute to the overall expenditure [@problem_id:1528596].", "problem": "In a hypothetical prokaryotic system, the synthesis of a protein via translation incurs energetic costs in the form of high-energy phosphate bond hydrolysis from Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP). The total cost can be determined by summing the costs of the four main stages of translation, which are defined as follows:\n\n1.  **Initiation**: The assembly of the ribosomal subunits on the messenger RNA (mRNA) and the binding of the initiator transfer RNA (tRNA) costs a total of 3 high-energy phosphate bonds. This is a fixed cost incurred once per protein.\n2.  **Amino Acid Activation**: Before an amino acid can be incorporated into the protein, it must be attached to its corresponding tRNA molecule. This activation process consumes energy equivalent to 2 high-energy phosphate bonds for each amino acid.\n3.  **Elongation**: For each subsequent amino acid added to the growing polypeptide chain after the first one, a cycle of reactions occurs. This cycle consumes a total of 2 high-energy phosphate bonds for tRNA delivery and ribosome translocation.\n4.  **Termination**: The release of the completed polypeptide chain from the ribosome requires the hydrolysis of 1 high-energy phosphate bond.\n\nConsider two different proteins synthesized in this system: Protein A, which is 100 amino acids long, and Protein B, which is 200 amino acids long.

This problem explores the consequences of such a 'nonsense mutation' and introduces a fascinating cellular mechanism known as suppression. By analyzing a scenario with a 'suppressor tRNA,' you will uncover how the cell can sometimes read through a premature stop codon, illustrating the dynamic competition between termination and continued translation [@problem_id:1528644].", "problem": "In a particular eukaryotic cell line, the gene for a structural protein called \"Stabilitin\" encodes a polypeptide that is normally 350 amino acids long. A spontaneous mutation occurs in this gene, changing the 100th codon from CAG, which codes for the amino acid glutamine, to UAG, which is a stop codon.\n\nIndependently, a second mutation arises in the same cell line. This mutation affects a gene encoding a specific transfer Ribonucleic Acid (tRNA). The tRNA that normally carries the amino acid serine (tRNA-Ser) and has the anticodon 3'-UCG-5' is altered. The mutation changes its anticodon to 3'-AUC-5', allowing it to recognize the UAG stop codon. The cell contains a population of both the normal tRNA-Ser and this new mutant \"suppressor\" tRNA-Ser.\n\nAssuming the ribosome encounters the mutant Stabilitin messenger RNA (mRNA) in this cell, which of the following choices best describes the protein products that will be synthesized?\n\nA. Only a truncated Stabilitin protein of 99 amino acids.\n\nB. Only a full-length Stabilitin protein of 350 amino acids, with serine at position 100.\n\nC. A mixture of a 99-amino-acid truncated protein and a full-length 350-amino-acid protein with serine at position 100.\n\nD. A mixture of a 99-amino-acid truncated protein and a full-length 350-amino-acid protein with glutamine at position 100.\n\nE. No Stabilitin protein will be produced, as the suppressor tRNA will be sequestered at the premature stop codon, halting all translation of this mRNA.", "solution": "The problem asks to determine the outcome of translating a specific messenger RNA (mRNA) in a cell that contains both a premature stop codon in the mRNA and a suppressor transfer Ribonucleic Acid (tRNA).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the initial mutation in the Stabilitin gene. The normal protein is 350 amino acids long. A mutation changes codon 100 from CAG (glutamine) to UAG (a stop codon). This type of mutation is called a nonsense mutation. In a normal cell without any other mutations, when the ribosome translating the Stabilitin mRNA reaches codon 100 (UAG), it will not recruit a tRNA. Instead, a protein known as a release factor will bind to the stop codon in the A-site of the ribosome. This binding triggers the hydrolysis of the bond linking the polypeptide chain to the tRNA in the P-site, causing the release of the newly synthesized, but incomplete, polypeptide. The ribosome then dissociates from the mRNA. The resulting protein would be a truncated version of Stabilitin, containing only the first 99 amino acids.\n\nNext, we must consider the effect of the second mutation, which creates a suppressor tRNA. A gene for a tRNA that normally carries serine (tRNA-Ser) has been mutated. The crucial point about tRNA function is that the amino acid is attached to the tRNA by an enzyme called an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. This enzyme recognizes the overall three-dimensional structure of its specific tRNA, not just the anticodon sequence. Therefore, despite the mutation in its anticodon, this suppressor tRNA will still be charged with the amino acid serine. The mutation changes the anticodon from 3'-UCG-5' (which pairs with the serine codon 5'-AGC-3') to 3'-AUC-5'. This new anticodon, 3'-AUC-5', is complementary to the stop codon 5'-UAG-3'.\n\nNow, we combine these two events. The ribosome begins translating the mutant Stabilitin mRNA. When it arrives at codon 100, which is UAG, the A-site is presented with a stop codon. At this point, there is a competition between two possible events:\n\n1.  **Termination:** The protein release factor can bind to the UAG codon, leading to the termination of translation and the release of a truncated 99-amino-acid polypeptide, just as it would in a cell without the suppressor tRNA.\n\n2.  **Suppression:** The mutant suppressor tRNA-Ser, which now has an anticodon (3'-AUC-5') that can pair with the UAG codon, can bind to the A-site. If it binds, the ribosome treats it like any other codon-anticodon pairing. It catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond, adding a serine to the growing polypeptide chain. Translation then continues along the mRNA until the ribosome reaches the original, true stop codon at the end of the gene (after codon 350). This process results in a full-length, 350-amino-acid Stabilitin protein. However, this protein is not identical to the wild-type; it has serine at position 100 instead of the original glutamine.\n\nSince the cell contains both the protein release factors and the suppressor tRNA, these two events (termination and suppression) will both occur, competing with each other at the UAG stop codon. The efficiency of suppression is never 100%. Consequently, the cell will not produce only one type of protein product from this mRNA. Instead, it will produce a mixture of two distinct polypeptide chains: the 99-amino-acid truncated protein resulting from termination, and the full-length 350-amino-acid protein (with serine at position 100) resulting from suppression.\n\nTherefore, the correct description of the outcome is a mixture of the truncated protein and the full-length, altered protein. This corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n- Option A is incorrect because it ignores the presence and function of the suppressor tRNA.\n- Option B is incorrect because it assumes suppression is 100% efficient, which is not the case. There is always competition from release factors.\n- Option D is incorrect because the suppressor tRNA is a modified tRNA-Ser and thus inserts serine, not the original amino acid glutamine. The translational machinery has no \"memory\" of the original genetic code at that position.\n- Option E is incorrect. While the suppressor tRNA binds to the UAG codon, it does not permanently halt translation; rather, it allows translation to continue, and it does not prevent termination from occurring in other instances.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1528644"}, {"introduction": "While most eukaryotic translation initiates at the 5' cap of an mRNA, some transcripts, especially those from viruses, use an alternative 'cap-independent' mechanism. These mRNAs contain a special sequence called an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) that recruits the ribosome directly.

To test this, the biologist designs several mRNA constructs and uses them in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate cell-free translation system, which contains all the necessary components for protein synthesis.\n\nThe core experimental design relies on a bicistronic vector. This vector is an mRNA molecule engineered to encode two distinct reporter proteins. The first reporter is Renilla Luciferase (RLuc), and the second is Firefly Luciferase (FLuc). Translation of RLuc is initiated via the standard 5' cap-dependent mechanism. Translation of the second reporter, FLuc, can only occur efficiently if the sequence inserted between the RLuc and FLuc coding regions functions as an IRES.\n\nThe following four mRNA constructs were prepared and added to separate translation reactions, each containing identical concentrations of mRNA:\n\n1.  **Negative Control**: A bicistronic mRNA with a non-functional spacer sequence between the RLuc and FLuc coding regions.\n    `5'-Cap-[RLuc]-[Spacer]-[FLuc]-Poly(A)-3'`\n2.  **Positive Control**: A bicistronic mRNA containing a well-characterized, strong IRES from the Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) between the RLuc and FLuc coding regions.\n    `5'-Cap-[RLuc]-[EMCV IRES]-[FLuc]-Poly(A)-3'`\n3.  **Test Construct**: A bicistronic mRNA containing the viral 5' untranslated region of interest (the Test Sequence) between the RLuc and FLuc coding regions.\n    `5'-Cap-[RLuc]-[Test Sequence]-[FLuc]-Poly(A)-3'`\n\nAfter incubation, the activity of both RLuc and FLuc was measured in each reaction. The luminescence, reported in Relative Light Units (RLU), is directly proportional to the amount of protein synthesized.
