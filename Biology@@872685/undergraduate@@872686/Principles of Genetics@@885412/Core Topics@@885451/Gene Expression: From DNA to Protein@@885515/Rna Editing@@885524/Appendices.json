This post-transcriptional modification can change the information encoded by the gene.\n\nConsider a short segment of a gene. The sequence of the non-template (or coding) DNA strand is given as:\n`5'-ATGGCA TTAGCGAAC-3'`\n\nAfter transcription and subsequent RNA editing, the corresponding mature mRNA molecule has the following sequence:\n`5'-AUGGUA UUAGCGGAC-3'`\n\nAssuming that the primary transcript (pre-mRNA) has a sequence directly corresponding to the coding DNA strand (with Uracil, U, replacing Thymine, T) and that Adenosine (A) to Inosine (I) editing occurs (where Inosine is read as Guanosine, G, by the ribosome), which of the following statements accurately describes the RNA editing event(s) that have occurred?

By the central dogma rule for transcription of the coding strand, the primary transcript (pre-mRNA) has the same sequence as the coding strand with $T$ replaced by $U$, giving:\n`5'-AUGGCAUUAGCGAAC-3'`.\n\nNumbering nucleotides from the $5'$ end, the pre-mRNA positions are:\n1 A, 2 U, 3 G, 4 G, 5 C, 6 A, 7 U, 8 U, 9 A, 10 G, 11 C, 12 G, 13 A, 14 A, 15 C.\n\nThe mature mRNA provided is `5'-AUGGUAUUAGCGGAC-3'`, whose positions are:\n1 A, 2 U, 3 G, 4 G, 5 U, 6 A, 7 U, 8 U, 9 A, 10 G, 11 C, 12 G, 13 G, 14 A, 15 C.\n\nComparing position by position:\n- At position 5: pre-mRNA has $C$, mature mRNA has $U$.

This exercise explores the direct functional consequences of RNA editing on protein synthesis. You will see how a single C-to-U edit can drastically alter a codon's meaning, in this case, converting an amino acid-coding codon into a stop signal, thereby demonstrating how editing can create profound changes from seemingly minor alterations [@problem_id:1518563].", "problem": "In certain eukaryotic organisms, a post-transcriptional modification process known as RNA editing can alter the sequence of an mRNA molecule. One common type is Cytidine-to-Uridine (C-to-U) editing, where a cytidine (C) nucleotide in the RNA is enzymatically converted to a uridine (U).\n\nConsider a hypothetical gene whose mRNA transcript contains the codon `5'-CGA-3'` at a critical position. During protein synthesis, this unedited codon is translated into an amino acid. However, if a C-to-U editing event occurs at the first position of this specific codon, it results in a non-synonymous change in the polypeptide chain.\n\nGiven the following partial genetic code table where codons are written 5' to 3':\n- `CGA`: Arginine\n- `UGG`: Tryptophan\n- `CUA`: Leucine\n- `UGA`: Stop\n\nWhat is the specific consequence of this C-to-U editing event at the first position of the `CGA` codon on the resulting polypeptide?\n\nA. A synonymous change, where the codon still codes for Arginine.\n\nB. A non-synonymous change, resulting in the incorporation of a Tryptophan residue.\n\nC. A non-synonymous change, resulting in the incorporation of a Leucine residue.\n\nD. A non-synonymous change, leading to premature termination of translation.\n\nE. A frameshift mutation, altering the entire downstream amino acid sequence.", "solution": "The problem asks for the consequence of a specific RNA editing event on protein synthesis. We can determine the outcome by following these steps.\n\nStep 1: Identify the original mRNA codon and the amino acid it codes for.\nThe problem states that the original codon in the mRNA sequence is `5'-CGA-3'`. According to the provided genetic code table, the codon `CGA` codes for the amino acid Arginine.\n\nStep 2: Determine the change that occurs due to RNA editing.\nThe editing process is described as Cytidine-to-Uridine (C-to-U) editing at the first position of the codon. This means the first base, Cytidine (C), is converted into Uridine (U).\n\nStep 3: Determine the new codon after the editing event.\nThe original codon is `CGA`. Changing the first base from C to U results in the new codon `5'-UGA-3'`.\n\nStep 4: Determine the meaning of the new, edited codon.\nWe refer to the provided genetic code table to find what the `UGA` codon specifies. The table indicates that `UGA` is a stop codon.\n\nStep 5: Analyze the consequence of the change from an amino acid-coding codon to a stop codon.\nThe original codon `CGA` would have led to the incorporation of an Arginine amino acid into the growing polypeptide chain. The new codon `UGA` is a termination signal. When the ribosome encounters a stop codon, it does not incorporate an amino acid; instead, it releases the polypeptide chain, terminating the process of translation. This leads to a truncated (shortened) protein, which is almost always non-functional. This type of mutation, which changes an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon, is called a nonsense mutation.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the given options based on this analysis.\n- Option A is incorrect. The change is from Arginine to a stop signal, which is a non-synonymous change, not a synonymous one.\n- Option B is incorrect. The edited codon is `UGA`, not `UGG` (which codes for Tryptophan).\n- Option C is incorrect. The edited codon is `UGA`, not `CUA` (which codes for Leucine).\n- Option D is correct. The change from an Arginine codon (`CGA`) to a stop codon (`UGA`) results in premature termination of translation. This is a type of non-synonymous change.\n- Option E is incorrect. A frameshift mutation is caused by the insertion or deletion of nucleotides, which shifts the reading frame. This event is a single-base substitution, which does not cause a frameshift.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1518563"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond the effect on a single molecule, this problem challenges you to think quantitatively about the impact of RNA editing at a cellular level. Given that editing is often an incomplete process, you must calculate the proportion of functional protein complexes when a specific percentage of transcripts are edited into a non-functional version. This exercise bridges the gap between molecular efficiency and the overall functional output in a cell, requiring you to apply principles of probability to a biological scenario [@problem_id:1518594].", "problem": "In the study of post-transcriptional gene regulation, a specific protein, which we will call Dimer-Dependent Kinase Regulator (DDKR), is found to be crucial for a cellular signaling pathway. The DDKR protein is only active when it forms a homodimer, a complex made of two identical DDKR protein units. The gene for DDKR undergoes a specific and well-characterized messenger RNA (mRNA) editing event where a single nucleotide is altered. This editing event produces a variant of the DDKR protein monomer that is completely non-functional, as it cannot bind to its target or form a stable dimer interface.\n\nExtensive sequencing has determined that this RNA editing process has an efficiency of 60.0%. This means that in the cellular pool of DDKR mRNA transcripts, 60.0% are edited, and the remaining are unedited. Assume that the protein monomers (both functional from unedited mRNA and non-functional from edited mRNA) are synthesized in direct proportion to the abundance of their respective transcripts and that they combine randomly to form dimers.\n\nCalculate the proportion of DDKR protein complexes that are fully functional within the cell. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the fraction of edited (nonfunctional) transcripts be $f_{e}=0.600$. Because protein synthesis is proportional to transcript abundance, the fraction of nonfunctional monomers is also $f_{e}=0.600$. The fraction of unedited (functional) monomers is therefore\n$$\nf_{u}=1-f_{e}=1-0.600=0.400.\n$$\nAssuming random combination into dimers, selecting the two monomers is independent. The possible pairings and their probabilities are $f_{u}^{2}$ (unedited–unedited), $2f_{u}f_{e}$ (heterodimer), and $f_{e}^{2}$ (edited–edited). Only the unedited–unedited dimer is fully functional. Hence, the proportion of fully functional dimers in the cellular pool is\n$$\nf_{\\text{functional}}=f_{u}^{2}=(0.400)^{2}=0.160.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this remains $0.160$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.160}$$", "id": "1518594"}]}
