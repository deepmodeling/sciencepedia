This practice challenges you to think like a molecular biologist and devise an experiment to prove it. By comparing the results of a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on genomic DNA versus a Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR) on mRNA, you can directly visualize the consequence of intron removal [@problem_id:1511942]. This exercise will solidify your understanding of gene structure and the fundamental outcome of splicing.", "problem": "A researcher is studying a newly discovered eukaryotic gene, `GEN-Y`. The gene is composed of two exons, Exon 1 and Exon 2, which are separated by a single intron, Intron 12. The known lengths of these regions are:\n- Exon 1: 210 base pairs (bp)\n- Intron 12: 550 bp\n- Exon 2: 340 bp\n\nTo investigate the expression and processing of `GEN-Y`, the researcher isolates total messenger RNA (mRNA) from cells and performs a Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) experiment. A pair of DNA primers is used for this analysis. The forward primer is designed to anneal to a sequence located entirely within Exon 1, and the reverse primer is designed to anneal to a sequence located entirely within Exon 2.\n\nAs a control, the researcher also uses the same primer pair to perform a standard PCR using genomic DNA as the template. This control experiment produces a DNA fragment of 780 bp.\n\nAssuming that Intron 12 is completely and correctly removed from the pre-mRNA to form the mature mRNA in these cells, calculate the expected size of the DNA fragment that will be produced by the RT-PCR experiment. Express your answer in base pairs (bp).", "solution": "Let the forward primer lie within Exon 1 at a distance $x$ from the Exon 1–Intron 12 junction (measured along Exon 1 toward the junction), and let the reverse primer lie within Exon 2 at a distance $y$ from the Exon 2–Intron 12 junction (measured along Exon 2 away from the junction). By design, both primers are entirely within their respective exons.\n\nPrinciple: In a genomic DNA PCR, the amplified fragment spans from the forward primer in Exon 1 through the entire intron to the reverse primer in Exon 2, so its length is the sum of the exon segments between the primers and the full intron length. Thus,\n$$\nL_{\\text{genomic}}=x+L_{\\text{intron}}+y.\n$$\nGiven $L_{\\text{genomic}}=780$ and $L_{\\text{intron}}=550$, we obtain\n$$\nx+y=780-550=230.\n$$\n\nPrinciple: In RT-PCR using mature mRNA (with the intron completely removed), the amplified cDNA fragment spans the same exon segments but without the intron. Therefore, the RT-PCR product length equals $x+y$. Hence,\n$$\nL_{\\text{RT-PCR}}=x+y=230.\n$$\n\nThis value is consistent with the given exon lengths, as it is possible for portions of Exon 1 (length $\\le 210$ bp) and Exon 2 (length $\\le 340$ bp) to have a combined length of 230 bp.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{230}$$", "id": "1511942"}, {"introduction": "Splicing is not a simple cut-and-paste process; it is exquisitely regulated, allowing for the production of multiple proteins from a single gene. This regulation is controlled by specific sequences in the RNA, including elements found within the exons themselves. This problem introduces you to the concept of an Exonic Splicing Silencer (ESS), a regulatory sequence that can cause the splicing machinery to skip an entire exon [@problem_id:1511952]. By analyzing the effect of a mutation that creates an ESS, you will explore a key mechanism behind alternative splicing and its role in genetic disease.", "problem": "A hypothetical human gene, designated *CELLREG1*, plays a role in cell cycle regulation. The pre-mRNA transcript of the wild-type *CELLREG1* gene consists of three exons and two introns, arranged in the following order from 5' to 3': Exon 1, Intron 1, Exon 2, Intron 2, Exon 3. In a healthy individual, the spliceosome correctly processes this pre-mRNA by removing both introns and ligating the three exons together to form the mature mRNA.\n\nResearchers have identified a patient with a rare genetic disorder linked to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the *CELLREG1* gene. This SNP is located within the sequence of Exon 2. This single base-pair change does not introduce a stop codon, but it creates a potent Exonic Splicing Silencer (ESS). An ESS is a cis-regulatory element that, when present within an exon, recruits specific inhibitory proteins. In this case, the binding of these proteins to the newly formed ESS in Exon 2 sterically interferes with the ability of the spliceosome to recognize the canonical splice sites immediately flanking Exon 2.\n\nAssuming this interference is highly effective, which of the following statements most accurately describes the predominant structure of the mature *CELLREG1* mRNA transcript produced from this mutated allele?\n\nA. The mature mRNA will consist of Exon 1 joined directly to Exon 3.\n\nB. The mature mRNA will be identical to the wild-type mRNA, but its translation will be terminated prematurely.\n\nC. The mature mRNA will contain Exon 1, Intron 1, and Exon 2, as the silencer prevents the removal of the first intron.\n\nD. The mature mRNA will contain all three exons and both introns, as the entire splicing process is inhibited.\n\nE. The pre-mRNA will be completely degraded, and no mature mRNA will be produced.\n\nF. The mature mRNA will consist of Exon 1 and Exon 2, with Exon 3 being excluded.", "solution": "The pre-mRNA is arranged as Exon 1, Intron 1, Exon 2, Intron 2, Exon 3. In normal splicing, both introns are removed and Exons 1, 2, and 3 are ligated to form the mature mRNA. An Exonic Splicing Silencer (ESS) within Exon 2 recruits inhibitory splicing factors, such as hnRNP proteins, that block spliceosome access to the canonical splice sites flanking Exon 2 (both the upstream 3' splice site at the end of Intron 1 and the downstream 5' splice site at the start of Intron 2). When this interference is highly effective, the spliceosome fails to recognize Exon 2 as an exon, resulting in exon skipping. In exon skipping, the spliceosome pairs the 5' splice site upstream of Exon 2 (at the end of Exon 1) with the 3' splice site downstream of Exon 2 (at the start of Exon 3), thereby excising Intron 1, Exon 2, and Intron 2 together as a single unit and ligating Exon 1 directly to Exon 3.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A describes exon skipping of Exon 2, which is the expected outcome of a strong ESS within Exon 2 that blocks recognition of its flanking splice sites.\n- B is incorrect because the SNP does not introduce a stop codon; the primary effect is on splicing, not on translation termination.\n- C is incorrect because the ESS does not specifically prevent removal of Intron 1; instead, it causes failure to include Exon 2, not intron retention.\n- D is incorrect because a global inhibition of all splicing does not follow from an ESS localized to Exon 2.\n- E is incorrect because pre-mRNA is not necessarily degraded; a predominant mature isoform via exon skipping is expected.\n- F is incorrect because exclusion of Exon 3 would not result from an ESS in Exon 2; the typical consequence is skipping of Exon 2.\n\nTherefore, the predominant mature mRNA consists of Exon 1 joined directly to Exon 3.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1511952"}, {"introduction": "With the complexity of splicing regulation, errors can inevitably occur, leading to messenger RNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs). To prevent the synthesis of potentially harmful truncated proteins, cells have evolved a sophisticated quality control system called Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD).

Applying a simplified rule, you will predict which mRNAs are targeted for destruction, gaining insight into this crucial surveillance mechanism.", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, a crucial quality control mechanism known as Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) identifies and degrades messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts that contain a Premature Termination Codon (PTC). This process prevents the synthesis of potentially harmful truncated proteins. The cell distinguishes a PTC from a legitimate stop codon based on its position relative to Exon Junction Complexes (EJCs), which are protein assemblies deposited on the mRNA during splicing.\n\nFor the purposes of this problem, we will model this complex biological process with a simplified but effective rule, often referred to as the \"50-nucleotide rule\". According to this rule, a termination codon is recognized as premature and the corresponding mRNA is targeted for degradation if, and only if, the codon is located more than 50 nucleotides upstream of the final exon-exon junction in the coding sequence. Stop codons found within 50 nucleotides of the final exon-exon junction, or located anywhere in the terminal exon, are considered legitimate and do not trigger NMD.\n\nConsider a hypothetical eukaryotic gene, designated *GENE-X*, which is composed of 5 exons.

The translation initiation codon (AUG) is located at the very beginning of Exon 1, and the gene's natural termination codon resides within Exon 5.\n\nSeveral different single-nucleotide mutations have been identified in *GENE-X*, each creating a PTC at a specific location. The locations are specified by the exon number and the nucleotide position within that exon, using 1-based indexing (i.e., the first nucleotide of an exon is at position 1).\n\nWhich of the following mutational scenarios would result in the degradation of the `GENE-X` mRNA transcript via the NMD pathway?\n\nA. A PTC is created at position 75 within Exon 1.\n\nB. A PTC is created at position 50 within Exon 3.\n\nC. A PTC is created at position 90 within Exon 4.\n\nD.
