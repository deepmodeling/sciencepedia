The formula for RSCU for a specific codon $i$ is given by:\n$$\nRSCU_i = \\frac{X_i}{\\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{j=1}^{k} X_j}\n$$\nwhere:\n- $X_i$ is the number of times codon $i$ is observed.\n- $k$ is the number of synonymous codons for the amino acid in question.\n- $\\sum_{j=1}^{k} X_j$ is the sum of the counts of all synonymous codons for that amino acid.\n\nThe term in the denominator, $\\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{j=1}^{k} X_j$, represents the expected count for any given codon if all synonymous codons were used equally (i.e., the average count).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the necessary values from the problem statement.**\nThe amino acid is Glycine, which is encoded by four synonymous codons. Therefore, the number of synonymous codons, $k$, is 4.\nThe codon of interest is GGC. The observed count for this codon, $X_{GGC}$, is 78.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total count of all synonymous codons for Glycine.**\nWe sum the counts for GGU, GGC, GGA, and GGG.\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{4} X_j = (\\text{Count of GGU}) + (\\text{Count of GGC}) + (\\text{Count of GGA}) + (\\text{Count of GGG})\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{4} X_j = 52 + 78 + 23 + 11 = 164\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the expected frequency (average count).**\nThis is the total count divided by the number of synonymous codons.\n$$\n\\text{Expected Count} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{j=1}^{k} X_j = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 164 = 41\n$$\nThis means if all four codons were used equally, we would expect each to appear 41 times.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the RSCU for the GGC codon.**\nNow we divide the observed count of GGC by the expected count.\n$$\nRSCU_{GGC} = \\frac{X_{GGC}}{\\text{Expected Count}} = \\frac{78}{41}\n$$\n$$\nRSCU_{GGC} \\approx 1.902439...\n$$\n\n**Step 5: Round the final answer to three significant figures.**\nThe first three significant figures are 1, 9, and 0.

The degeneracy of the genetic code presents a common challenge in molecular biology, especially when trying to amplify a gene whose exact sequence is unknown. This next practice problem [@problem_id:1477945] explores how to design a \"degenerate\" PCR primer, calculating the mixture's complexity to ensure all possible coding sequences for a target peptide are accounted for.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating a newly discovered family of metabolic enzymes and has identified a short, highly conserved peptide motif with the amino acid sequence: Methionine-Tryptophan-Lysine-Glutamine-Phenylalanine. To isolate the gene encoding this protein from a related organism, the biologist plans to use a degenerate primer in a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) experiment. A degenerate primer is a mixture of oligonucleotides that accounts for the redundancy in the genetic code.\n\nAssuming the standard genetic code applies, you are given the messenger RNA (mRNA) codons for each amino acid in the motif:\n- Methionine (Met): AUG\n- Tryptophan (Trp): UGG\n- Lysine (Lys): AAA, AAG\n- Glutamine (Gln): CAA, CAG\n- Phenylalanine (Phe): UUU, UUC\n\nCalculate the minimum number of unique DNA oligonucleotide sequences that must be synthesized to create a degenerate primer mixture that fully accounts for all possible coding sequences for this five-amino-acid motif.", "solution": "We are to determine how many distinct DNA oligonucleotide sequences are required in a degenerate primer mixture to cover all possible nucleotide sequences encoding the peptide motif Methionine–Tryptophan–Lysine–Glutamine–Phenylalanine under the standard genetic code.\n\nFirst, translate the provided mRNA codons into DNA codons by replacing $U$ with $T$:\n- Methionine (Met): mRNA $AUG$ corresponds to DNA $ATG$. There is $1$ codon.\n- Tryptophan (Trp): mRNA $UGG$ corresponds to DNA $TGG$. There is $1$ codon.\n- Lysine (Lys): mRNA $AAA$, $AAG$ correspond to DNA $AAA$, $AAG$. There are $2$ codons.\n- Glutamine (Gln): mRNA $CAA$, $CAG$ correspond to DNA $CAA$, $CAG$. There are $2$ codons.\n- Phenylalanine (Phe): mRNA $UUU$, $UUC$ correspond to DNA $TTT$, $TTC$. There are $2$ codons.\n\nIn a degenerate primer synthesized with standard DNA nucleotides, the number of unique sequences present in the mixture equals the product of the degeneracies at each amino acid position because each independent choice at a codon position multiplies the total number of distinct oligonucleotides in the mixture.\n\nTherefore, the total number of unique oligonucleotides required is\n$$\nN = 1 \\times 1 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8.\n$$\nThis is the minimum because Methionine and Tryptophan contribute no degeneracy, while Lysine, Glutamine, and Phenylalanine each contribute a twofold choice at their third nucleotide, yielding $2^{3}$ total combinations.

However, simply swapping codons to the host's most frequent choices can sometimes backfire. This final exercise [@problem_id:2026563] delves into a fascinating and realistic scenario where an \"optimized\" sequence leads to *less* protein, demonstrating how synonymous codon changes can unintentionally create secondary structures in mRNA that block translation. It's a powerful reminder that the effects of codon choice go beyond simple tRNA availability.", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is working to express a foreign protein in *Escherichia coli*. The initial construct, plasmid `pWT`, produces the protein at a low level. To improve this, the biologist creates a new construct, `pOPT`, by performing \"codon optimization.\" This involves making synonymous mutations (changing the DNA sequence without altering the resulting amino acid sequence) to match the codons to those most frequently used by *E. coli*. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the target protein is Met-Gly-Val.\n\nThe 5' Untranslated Region (5' UTR) of the mRNA, which lies upstream of the protein-coding sequence, is identical for both constructs. It contains a key sequence, `5'-CACCC-3'`, located just before the Ribosome Binding Site (RBS). The protein Coding Sequence (CDS) begins immediately after the 5' UTR with the start codon `AUG`.\n\nThe specific codon changes are as follows:\n- **`pWT` construct:** Uses the codons `GGU` for Glycine and `GUU` for Valine.\n- **`pOPT` construct:** Uses the optimized codons `GGG` for Glycine and `GUG` for Valine.\n\nCounter-intuitively, the biologist observes that the `pOPT` construct produces significantly *less* protein than the `pWT` construct. The suspected cause is the unintended formation of a stable mRNA hairpin loop that sequesters the RBS, preventing translation initiation.\n\nA simplified model is proposed to assess the stability of this potential hairpin. A stem can form via an intramolecular interaction between the `5'-CACCC-3'` sequence in the 5' UTR and the corresponding five-nucleotide sequence in the CDS starting at the +4 position (where the A of the `AUG` start codon is position +1).\n\nThe Gibbs free energy of formation for the 5-base-pair stem, $\\Delta G_{stem}$, is the sum of the energies of the individual pairs:\n- Guanine-Cytosine (G-C) pair: $\\Delta G_{GC} = -3.4 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n- Adenine-Uracil (A-U) pair: $\\Delta G_{AU} = -2.1 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n- Guanine-Uracil (G-U) wobble pair: $\\Delta G_{GU} = -1.1 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n- Mismatched pairs contribute $0 \\text{ kJ/mol}$ to the stability.\n\nCalculate the change in hairpin stem stability resulting from the codon optimization, defined as $\\Delta (\\Delta G_{stem}) = \\Delta G_{stem, pOPT} - \\Delta G_{stem, pWT}$.
