Each of these enzymes is responsible for attaching a specific amino acid to its corresponding set of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. This \"charging\" reaction creates an aminoacyl-tRNA, which then participates in translation.\n\nConsider a hypothetical eukaryotic cell line in which a mutation has occurred in the gene encoding seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS). This mutation alters the amino acid binding pocket of the SerRS enzyme, causing it to lose its ability to recognize its normal substrate, the amino acid serine. Instead, the mutated enzyme now exclusively recognizes and binds the amino acid threonine. However, the mutation does not affect the enzyme's ability to recognize and bind its cognate tRNAs, the seryl-tRNAs ($tRNA^{Ser}$). All other components of the translational machinery, including the threonyl-tRNA synthetase, threonine codons, and serine codons on messenger RNAs (mRNAs), are normal.\n\nWhat would be the most direct and immediate consequence for proteins synthesized in this cell line?\n\nA. Threonine would be incorporated into the polypeptide chain at positions specified by serine codons.\n\nB. Serine would be incorporated into the polypeptide chain at positions specified by threonine codons.\n\nC. Translation would halt at serine codons because the ribosome would reject the incorrectly charged tRNA.\n\nD. The seryl-tRNA's anticodon would be modified by the mutated synthetase to match a threonine codon.", "solution": "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases ensure translational fidelity by attaching the correct amino acid to its cognate tRNA; the ribosome then selects tRNAs based on codon-anticodon base pairing without checking the attached amino acid. Normally, seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) catalyzes the reaction\n$$\n\\text{Ser} + \\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ser}} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{Ser-tRNA}^{\\text{Ser}} + \\text{AMP} + \\text{PP}_{\\text{i}}.\n$$\nIn the mutant described, the enzyme’s amino acid recognition pocket has switched specificity from serine to threonine while retaining recognition of $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ser}}$.

However, these $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ser}}$ molecules now carry threonine. The ribosome does not proofread the amino acid on the tRNA; it accepts any amino acid attached to a tRNA whose anticodon correctly pairs with the codon. Consequently, at positions in the polypeptide specified by serine codons, threonine will be incorporated.\n\nAll other possibilities are inconsistent with these principles: serine will not be redirected to threonine codons (the mutated enzyme does not charge $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Thr}}$), translation will not halt at serine codons because the ribosome does not reject misacylated tRNAs based on amino acid identity, and the synthetase does not modify tRNA anticodons to change codon specificity.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate consequence is incorporation of threonine at positions specified by serine codons.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1468663"}, {"introduction": "While synthetases are highly specific, discriminating between structurally similar amino acids like isoleucine and valine poses a significant challenge. To overcome this, many synthetases have evolved a proofreading function. This practice [@problem_id:2303560] examines what happens when this crucial editing mechanism is lost, forcing you to consider how biological systems achieve such high fidelity through multi-step verification processes.", "problem": "The fidelity of protein synthesis is critically dependent on the accuracy of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS), enzymes that catalyze the attachment of a specific amino acid to its corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA). This process is called tRNA charging. Some aaRS enzymes possess a hydrolytic editing domain that acts as a proofreading mechanism to remove incorrectly attached amino acids.\n\nA well-studied example is isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS), which is responsible for charging isoleucine (Ile) onto its cognate tRNA, $tRNA^{Ile}$. Due to the high structural similarity between isoleucine and valine (Val), IleRS occasionally binds valine by mistake in its activation site.\n\nConsider a bacterial strain with a mutation that renders the hydrolytic editing domain of its IleRS enzyme completely non-functional. However, the domains responsible for amino acid activation and tRNA charging remain fully active. What is the most likely consequence of this mutation on proteins synthesized within these bacterial cells?\n\nA. Valine will be incorporated into proteins at positions where isoleucine is specified by the genetic code.\n\nB. Isoleucine will be incorporated into proteins at positions where valine is specified by the genetic code.\n\nC.

The ribosome will reject the incorrectly charged $tRNA^{Ile}$, preventing any errors in the final protein sequence.\n\nE. Leucine will be incorporated into proteins at positions where isoleucine is specified by the genetic code.", "solution": "Principles:\n- Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) determine the amino acid identity attached to a given tRNA; the ribosome selects tRNAs based on codon-anticodon pairing, not by verifying the attached amino acid.\n- IleRS normally activates isoleucine but can misactivate valine due to structural similarity. An editing (hydrolytic) domain proofreads by hydrolyzing misactivated valine or mischarged valyl-tRNA to prevent errors.\n- If the editing domain is non-functional while activation and charging remain intact, mischarged tRNAs will accumulate.\n\nMechanism:\n1. Normal charging reaction (intended):\n$$\n\\text{Ile} + \\text{ATP} + \\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ile}} \\xrightarrow{\\text{IleRS}} \\text{Ile-tRNA}^{\\text{Ile}} + \\text{AMP} + \\text{PP}_{\\text{i}}.\n$$\n2.

In the mutant lacking hydrolytic editing, step 3 fails. Consequently, the enzyme proceeds to mischarge:\n$$\n\\text{Val} + \\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ile}} \\xrightarrow{\\text{IleRS (no editing)}} \\text{Val-tRNA}^{\\text{Ile}}.\n$$\n5. During translation, the ribosome accepts $\\text{tRNA}^{\\text{Ile}}$ at isoleucine codons (AUU, AUC, AUA) based on correct anticodon pairing.

The overall fidelity of an aaRS is often achieved through a two-step mechanism: an initial discrimination at the aminoacylation (synthesis) site and a subsequent proofreading step at a separate editing site.\n\nConsider the case of Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS), which must distinguish its cognate amino acid, isoleucine (Ile), from the structurally similar non-cognate amino acid, valine (Val). In a wild-type cell, the synthesis site of IleRS exhibits a discrimination factor of 100, meaning it preferentially binds isoleucine over valine by a factor of 100. After the amino acid is attached to the tRNA, any incorrectly formed Val-$tRNA^{Ile}$ is subjected to proofreading. The editing site of the wild-type IleRS has a discrimination factor of 250, meaning it is 250 times more likely to recognize and hydrolyze an incorrect Val-$tRNA^{Ile}$ than to release it intact.\n\nNow, imagine a scenario where a genetic mutation results in the complete deletion of the IleRS editing domain, rendering the proofreading step entirely non-functional.

Thus the escaping (released) fraction of incorrect product, relative to the case with no editing, is reduced by a factor $D_{e}$, so the surviving fraction is\n$$\nf_{\\text{survive}}=\\frac{1}{D_{e}}.\n$$\n\nTherefore:\n- With wild-type enzyme (synthesis plus editing), the fraction of incorrect product that survives to potentially be used for translation is\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{D_{s}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{D_{e}}\\right).\n$$\n- With the mutant lacking editing, the fraction of incorrect product that survives is\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{D_{s}}\\right).\n$$\n\nHence, the fold increase in valine misincorporation when editing is deleted is\n$$\n\\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{D_{s}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{1}{D_{s}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{D_{e}}\\right)}=D_{e}.\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given value $D_{e}=250$, the fold increase is $250$.
