[@problem_id:1467433]", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the 5' end of a newly synthesized pre-mRNA transcript undergoes a crucial modification process known as 5' capping. This process is essential for mRNA stability, efficient splicing, nuclear export, and initiation of translation. The capping process is a coordinated series of three enzymatic reactions that occur co-transcriptionally.\n\n1.  **Phosphatase activity**: An RNA triphosphatase enzyme removes the terminal (gamma) phosphate from the 5' triphosphate end of the nascent pre-mRNA.\n2.  **Transferase activity**: A guanylyltransferase enzyme catalyzes the addition of a guanosine monophosphate (GMP) moiety, derived from a Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) molecule, to the 5' diphosphate end of the transcript. This forms an unusual 5'-to-5' triphosphate linkage.\n3.  **Methylase activity**: A methyltransferase enzyme adds a methyl group to the nitrogen at position 7 of the newly added guanine base, forming the final 7-methylguanosine ($m^7G$) cap structure.\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment involving a mutant strain of yeast. This strain possesses a loss-of-function mutation in the gene that encodes the RNA triphosphatase enzyme, rendering it completely inactive. However, the guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase enzymes are present and fully functional. Assume that transcription by RNA Polymerase II initiates normally in this strain, producing a pre-mRNA with a triphosphate group at its 5' end.\n\nWhich one of the following options best represents the chemical structure that would be found at the 5' end of the majority of pre-mRNA transcripts after they are synthesized and subjected to the available capping machinery in these mutant cells?\n\nFor the options below, let `N` represent the first nucleotide of the transcript, `G` represent the added guanosine, `$m^7G$` represent the 7-methylguanosine, `p` represent a phosphate group, `pp` a diphosphate, etc. The notation `(5')ppp(5')` signifies a 5'-5' triphosphate linkage.\n\nA. $m^7\\text{G(5')ppp(5')N}$\n\nB. $\\text{pppN}$\n\nC. $\\text{ppN}$\n\nD. $m^7\\text{G(5')pppp(5')N}$\n\nE. $\\text{G(5')ppp(5')N}$", "solution": "The normal 5' capping pathway on a nascent pre-mRNA synthesized by RNA Polymerase II proceeds via three co-transcriptional enzymatic steps:\n\n1) RNA triphosphatase removes the terminal gamma phosphate from the 5' end of the transcript. If the nascent RNA begins with a 5' triphosphate (denoted pppN, where N is the first nucleotide), this step converts $\\text{pppN} \\to \\text{ppN}$.\n\n2) Guanylyltransferase adds GMP from GTP to the 5' diphosphate end of the RNA through a 5'-5' triphosphate linkage. Mechanistically, the enzyme first forms a covalent enzyme–GMP intermediate from GTP with release of pyrophosphate, then transfers GMP to the RNA 5' diphosphate. This step requires a 5' diphosphate end as the acceptor and converts $\\text{ppN} \\to \\text{G(5')ppp(5')N}$.\n\n3) Methyltransferase methylates the added guanine at the N7 position, converting $\\text{G(5')ppp(5')N} \\to m^7\\text{G(5')ppp(5')N}$.\n\nIn the mutant strain described, the RNA triphosphatase is completely inactive, while guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase are fully functional. Therefore:\n\n- The initial 5' end produced by RNA Polymerase II is $\\text{pppN}$.\n- Without triphosphatase activity, the conversion $\\text{pppN} \\to \\text{ppN}$ cannot occur. Thus, the RNA 5' end remains triphosphorylated and never becomes the required 5' diphosphate acceptor for guanylyltransferase.\n- Guanylyltransferase cannot add GMP to a 5' triphosphate end; its substrate requirement is a 5' diphosphate RNA. Therefore, no cap structure is formed.\n- Methyltransferase requires the guanosine cap substrate for N7 methylation; in the absence of a transferred G cap, it has no substrate and cannot act.\n\nBy elimination of the options:\n\n- A ($m^7\\text{G(5')ppp(5')N}$) requires successful guanylyltransferase addition and subsequent methylation, which cannot occur because the 5' end is not converted to a diphosphate.\n- B ($\\text{pppN}$) corresponds to the unchanged 5' triphosphate on the nascent transcript and matches the biochemical block.\n- C ($\\text{ppN}$) would be the product of triphosphatase alone; this enzyme is inactive here.\n- D ($m^7\\text{G(5')pppp(5')N}$) is not produced in canonical capping and also requires an initial transfer reaction that cannot proceed.\n- E ($\\text{G(5')ppp(5')N}$) is the unmethylated cap; it still requires guanylyltransferase action on a 5' diphosphate, which is unavailable.\n\nTherefore, the majority of pre-mRNA 5' ends remain as the original triphosphate, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1467433"}, {"introduction": "After understanding how the 5' cap is synthesized, it's crucial to explore its biological function. This problem uses the concept of a competitive inhibitor, a common tool in biochemistry, to probe the cap's critical role in initiating protein synthesis by interacting with specific translation factors. [@problem_id:1467472]", "problem": "A researcher is investigating the process of protein synthesis using a eukaryotic cell-free translation system. This system contains all the necessary components for translation, including functional ribosomes, a full complement of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) with their corresponding aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, amino acids, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and a pool of mature, capped, and polyadenylated messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts for a specific protein. The system is functioning optimally, producing the expected protein. The researcher then introduces a high concentration of a synthetic cap analog, 7-methylguanosine monophosphate (7-mGMP), into the reaction mixture.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate molecular event that disrupts the initiation of translation in this system?\n\nA. The eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) will bind to the free 7-mGMP, preventing its association with the 5' end of mature mRNAs.\nB. The 7-mGMP will directly block the interaction between the eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) scaffold protein and the Poly(A)-Binding Protein (PABP).\nC. The 7-mGMP will bind to the 3' poly(A) tail of mRNAs, leading to their premature degradation by exonucleases.\nD. The 40S ribosomal subunit will fail to associate with the 60S subunit to form the functional 80S ribosome at the start codon.\nE. The 7-mGMP will competitively inhibit RNA Polymerase II, preventing the synthesis of any new mRNA transcripts within the system.", "solution": "We identify the key step of eukaryotic translation initiation in a cap-dependent, cell-free system. In eukaryotes, initiation begins when the cap-binding protein eIF4E recognizes and binds the 5' cap structure of mature mRNA, which is a 7-methylguanosine linked by a triphosphate bridge to the first nucleotide (commonly denoted as m7GpppN). eIF4E is a subunit of the eIF4F complex (with eIF4G and eIF4A). eIF4G also binds PABP at the 3' poly(A) tail to promote mRNA circularization, and eIF3 links the eIF4F-bound mRNA to the 43S preinitiation complex. After cap recognition and 43S recruitment, scanning occurs, followed by start-codon recognition and subsequent 60S joining to form the 80S ribosome.\n\nThe researcher adds a high concentration of 7-methylguanosine monophosphate (7-mGMP), a cap analog. The immediate biochemical consequence depends on competitive interactions at the cap-binding step. eIF4E specifically recognizes the methylated guanine moiety of the cap. A free cap analog such as 7-mGMP can occupy the cap-binding pocket of eIF4E and thereby competitively inhibit eIF4E binding to the authentic 5' cap on mRNAs. At sufficiently high concentration, the analog sequesters eIF4E away from capped mRNAs, preventing the formation of the eIF4F complex on the mRNA and blocking recruitment of the 43S preinitiation complex. This disrupts initiation at the earliest cap recognition step.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A states that eIF4E will bind the free 7-mGMP, preventing its association with the 5' end of mature mRNAs. This precisely describes the immediate competitive sequestration of eIF4E by the cap analog, blocking cap-dependent initiation.\n- Option B suggests direct blockade of the eIF4G–PABP interaction by 7-mGMP; this is a protein–protein interaction not directly targeted by a cap analog.\n- Option C suggests binding of 7-mGMP to the 3' poly(A) tail; this is incorrect both in specificity and mechanism.\n- Option D describes failure of subunit joining at the start codon, which is a downstream step; the immediate effect occurs earlier at cap recognition.\n- Option E posits inhibition of RNA Polymerase II, which is irrelevant in a translation-only cell-free system supplied with mature mRNAs and not the direct target of 7-mGMP.\n\nTherefore, the immediate molecular event is the sequestration of eIF4E by the cap analog, preventing eIF4E from binding the mRNA 5' cap, as in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1467472"}, {"introduction": "This final practice moves beyond qualitative descriptions to a quantitative analysis of the capping process.

An RNA triphosphatase removes the terminal gamma-phosphate from the 5' end of the transcript.\n2.  A guanylyltransferase adds a Guanosine Monophosphate (GMP) molecule, derived from a Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) substrate, to the 5' end, forming a 5'-5' triphosphate linkage.\n3.  Two methylation reactions occur. The universal methyl donor for these reactions is S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). The regeneration of one molecule of SAM from its byproduct, S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH), is an energy-dependent process that ultimately requires the consumption of one molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). The two standard methylation events for a Cap 1 structure are the methylation of the guanine base at the N7 position and the methylation of the 2'-hydroxyl group of the first nucleotide of the RNA chain.\n\nThe virus under investigation produces a unique enzyme that performs two *additional* methylation reactions on the host's Cap 1 structure. This viral enzyme methylates the 2'-hydroxyl group of the *second* nucleotide in the RNA sequence and adds a second methyl group to the capping guanine base at a different position.\n\nAssuming the entire process begins with a 5'-triphosphate on the nascent pre-mRNA, calculate the stoichiometric ratio of the total number of GTP molecules consumed to the total number of ATP molecules consumed for the complete synthesis of one of these virally-modified, hyper-methylated caps.
