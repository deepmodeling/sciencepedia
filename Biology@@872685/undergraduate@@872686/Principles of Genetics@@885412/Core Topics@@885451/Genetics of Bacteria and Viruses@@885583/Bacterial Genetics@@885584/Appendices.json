The goal is to isolate mutants with temperature-sensitive (ts) lethal mutations. A ts-lethal mutant is a strain that can grow and divide at a lower \"permissive\" temperature but cannot survive at a higher \"restrictive\" temperature, typically due to a mutation in an essential gene.\n\nThe experimental procedure is as follows:\n1. A liquid culture of wild-type *E. coli* is treated with a chemical mutagen to induce random mutations.\n2. The mutagenized cells are spread onto a master plate containing a complete nutrient medium.\n3. This master plate is incubated at the permissive temperature of 30°C, which allows all viable cells (wild-type and mutants) to form colonies.\n4. Using a sterile velvet pad, the colonies from the master plate are transferred to two new plates (Plate A and Plate B) in a process called replica plating. Both new plates contain the same complete nutrient medium as the master plate.\n5. Plate A is incubated at the permissive temperature of 30°C.\n6. Plate B is incubated at the restrictive temperature of 42°C.\n\nAfter a suitable incubation period, the pattern of colonies on Plate A and Plate B is compared. Which of the following statements correctly describes how the geneticist can identify the colonies corresponding to the desired temperature-sensitive lethal mutants?\n\nA. Colonies that appear on Plate B but are absent from the corresponding position on Plate A.\n\nB. Colonies that appear on both Plate A and Plate B.\n\nC.

Let $T_{p}$ denote the permissive temperature and $T_{r}$ the restrictive temperature, with $T_{p}=30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and $T_{r}=42^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Define a growth indicator function $G(T)$ for a given clone such that $G(T)=1$ if the clone forms a colony at temperature $T$ on complete medium, and $G(T)=0$ otherwise. Then:\n- For wild-type: $G(T_{p})=1$ and $G(T_{r})=1$.\n- For a ts-lethal mutant: $G(T_{p})=1$ and $G(T_{r})=0$.\n- For nonviable mutants: $G(T_{p})=0$ and $G(T_{r})=0$ (these will not appear on the master plate).\n- For cold-sensitive mutants (not sought here): $G(T_{p})=0$ and $G(T_{r})=1$ (these would not appear on the master plate grown at $T_{p}$).\n\nIn the procedure, the master plate is incubated at $T_{p}$, so only clones with $G(T_{p})=1$ produce colonies there. Replica plating preserves the spatial pattern of colonies; thus:\n- Plate A, incubated at $T_{p}$, shows colonies for all clones with $G(T_{p})=1$ (same pattern as the master plate, allowing for occasional transfer loss).\n- Plate B, incubated at $T_{r}$, shows colonies only for clones with $G(T_{r})=1$.\n\nThe desired ts-lethal mutants satisfy $G(T_{p})=1$ and $G(T_{r})=0$, which corresponds to colonies present on Plate A (permissive) but absent at the same positions on Plate B (restrictive).\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A: Colonies on Plate B but absent on Plate A would imply $G(T_{r})=1$ and $G(T_{p})=0$, inconsistent with initial growth at $T_{p}$ and indicative of cold sensitivity, not ts-lethality.\n- B: Colonies on both plates have $G(T_{p})=1$ and $G(T_{r})=1$, consistent with wild-type or non-ts mutants.\n- C: Colonies on Plate A but absent on Plate B have $G(T_{p})=1$ and $G(T_{r})=0$, the defining signature of ts-lethal mutants.\n- D: Colonies absent from both plates would not have been recoverable from the master plate grown at $T_{p}$ (or reflect transfer failure), and do not identify ts-lethal mutants.\n\nTherefore, the correct identification criterion is colonies present on Plate A but absent on Plate B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1470923"}, {"introduction": "Once mutants are identified, a key next step is to understand where the responsible genes are located on the chromosome. This problem explores bacterial conjugation, a natural mechanism of DNA transfer that geneticists have harnessed for gene mapping. By analyzing the results of a hypothetical High-frequency recombination (Hfr) mating experiment, you can practice calculating the frequency of gene transfer and appreciate why genes located far from the starting point of transfer are inherited so rarely [@problem_id:1470893].", "problem": "In a bacterial genetics experiment, a High-frequency recombination (Hfr) strain of *E. coli* is mated with an F- recipient strain. The Hfr strain is prototrophic for all required nutrients and sensitive to the antibiotic streptomycin ($Str^s$). Its chromosome transfers genes in a specific linear sequence, starting from an origin of transfer, *oriT*. For this particular Hfr strain, the gene order is *oriT*...*leu*...*trp*...*his*...*F-factor*. The F-factor, which contains the genes for donor ability, is the terminal segment to be transferred. The F- recipient strain is auxotrophic for leucine, tryptophan, and histidine ($leu^-$, $trp^-$, $his^-$) and is resistant to streptomycin ($Str^r$).\n\nThe two strains are mixed and allowed to conjugate for 120 minutes. After this incubation, the Hfr donor cells are selectively killed by adding streptomycin to the culture. The remaining cells, which are potential recombinants, are then plated on a minimal medium containing streptomycin and supplemented with leucine and tryptophan, but lacking histidine. This selective plating strategy ensures that only recipient cells that have incorporated the `$his^+$` gene and are resistant to streptomycin ($Str^r$ $his^+$) can form colonies.\n\nFrom this procedure, a total of 625 $Str^r$ $his^+$ recombinant colonies were counted. To determine the frequency of donor conversion, a sample of these 625 colonies was then individually tested for fertility by checking their ability to transfer genetic material to a new F- strain. This detailed analysis revealed that only 4 of these $Str^r$ $his^+$ colonies had successfully received the F-factor and were converted into donor cells.\n\nBased on these experimental results, calculate the probability that a recipient cell that has successfully integrated the `$his^+$` gene marker also becomes a donor cell. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "We are asked for the probability that a recipient cell which has successfully integrated the $his^{+}$ marker also becomes a donor (i.e., received the F-factor). The experimental selection ensures that only recipient-derived $Str^{r} his^{+}$ recombinants form colonies. Therefore, among the observed recombinant colonies, the fraction that became donors equals the number that received the F-factor divided by the total number of $Str^{r} his^{+}$ recombinants.\n\nLet $D$ denote the event “cell is donor (received F-factor)” and $H$ denote the event “cell is a $Str^{r} his^{+}$ recombinant.” The required probability is\n$$\nP(D \\mid H)=\\frac{\\text{number of }Str^{r} his^{+}\\text{ recombinants that are donors}}{\\text{total number of }Str^{r} his^{+}\\text{ recombinants}}=\\frac{4}{625}.\n$$\nTo express this as a decimal, note that $625=5^{4}$ and\n$$\n\\frac{4}{625}=\\frac{4 \\times 16}{625 \\times 16}=\\frac{64}{10000}=0.0064.\n$$\nRounded to two significant figures, $0.0064$ already has two significant digits, so the rounded value remains $0.0064$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0064}$$", "id": "1470893"}, {"introduction": "Bacterial conjugation not only allows for gene mapping but also for the construction of special strains, such as partial diploids (merodiploids), that are crucial for understanding gene regulation. This problem challenges you to dissect the famous *lac* operon by predicting the outcome in a merodiploid cell. Success requires applying the critical distinction between *cis*-acting elements, which are DNA sequences that only affect the gene copy they are part of, and *trans*-acting factors, which are diffusible proteins that can act on any relevant gene copy in the cell [@problem_id:1470896].", "problem": "A genetics student is studying the regulation of the *lac* operon in *Escherichia coli*. The operon's key components are defined as follows:\n- `*I*`: The regulator gene, which codes for a repressor protein. The wild-type allele `$I^+$` produces a functional repressor.\n- `*P*`: The promoter, where RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription. The wild-type allele is `$P^+$`.\n- `*O*`: The operator, the binding site for the repressor protein.

Thus any $I^{+}$ allele produces functional repressor that can diffuse and bind to any $O^{+}$ operator in the cell.\n2) The operator $O$ acts in cis. An $O^{c}$ mutation prevents repressor binding only to that same DNA molecule; it does not affect the operator on the other copy.\n3) The $Z$ gene encodes beta-galactosidase; $Z^{+}$ yields functional enzyme, $Z^{-}$ yields a non-functional enzyme.\n4) Induction by lactose occurs when the inducer (allolactose) binds the repressor, preventing its binding to $O^{+}$ and allowing transcription from $P^{+}$.\n\nEvaluate each chromosomal/plasmid copy:\n- Copy 1: $I^{+}P^{+}O^{c}Z^{-}$. Because $O^{c}$ prevents repressor binding in cis, transcription from this operon is constitutive. However, $Z^{-}$ produces no functional beta-galactosidase, so this copy never contributes functional enzyme, regardless of lactose.\n- Copy 2: $I^{+}P^{+}O^{+}Z^{+}$. This operon is regulatable: in the absence of inducer, the $I^{+}$ repressor binds $O^{+}$ and blocks transcription; in the presence of lactose (inducer), the repressor is inactivated and transcription proceeds, producing functional beta-galactosidase from $Z^{+}$.\n\nPredict phenotypes by condition:\n- No lactose present (glucose as sole carbon source): There is no inducer, so the $I^{+}$ repressor binds $O^{+}$ on the $Z^{+}$ operon and prevents transcription. The $O^{c}Z^{-}$ operon, although transcribed, cannot produce functional enzyme. Net result: no functional beta-galactosidase.\n- Lactose present (lactose as sole carbon source): Inducer inactivates the $I^{+}$ repressor, allowing transcription from the $P^{+}O^{+}Z^{+}$ operon, producing functional beta-galactosidase. The $O^{c}Z^{-}$ operon still does not produce functional enzyme, but it is irrelevant to the functional output.\n\nTherefore, the strain produces functional beta-galactosidase only in the presence of lactose, i.e., inducible expression.\n\nThe correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1470896"}]}
