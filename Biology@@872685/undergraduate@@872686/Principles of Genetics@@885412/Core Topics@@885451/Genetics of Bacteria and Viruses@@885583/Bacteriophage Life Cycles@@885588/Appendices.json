The experiment is set up by mixing phages and bacteria such that the average number of phages per bacterium, known as the Multiplicity of Infection (MOI), is 4.0. The random attachment of phages to bacteria follows the Poisson distribution, where the probability $P(k)$ of a single cell being infected by $k$ phages is given by the formula:\n$$P(k) = \\frac{\\lambda^{k} \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nIn this equation, $\\lambda$ represents the MOI.\n\nIt is hypothesized that a lytic cycle is almost certainly triggered if a cell is infected by at least two phages.

By analyzing a classic co-infection experiment with temperature-sensitive mutants, you'll uncover the principle of genetic complementation, a cornerstone of genetic analysis that allows scientists to determine if two mutations affect the same or different genes.", "problem": "In a genetics laboratory, a researcher is studying two different temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of bacteriophage T4, a virus that infects *Escherichia coli* bacteria. Plaque formation on a lawn of bacteria is used as an indicator of a successful lytic infection cycle, where phages replicate and lyse the host cells.\n\nThe two mutants, designated `ts1` and `ts2`, behave as follows:\n- At a permissive temperature of 30°C, both `ts1` and `ts2` can infect *E. coli* and form plaques normally.\n- At a non-permissive temperature of 42°C, neither `ts1` nor `ts2` can form plaques when used to infect *E. coli* cultures on their own. Further analysis reveals that the `ts1` mutation is in a gene essential for viral DNA replication, while the `ts2` mutation is in a gene required for the assembly of the phage's tail fibers.\n\nThe researcher then performs a co-infection experiment. A culture of *E. coli* is simultaneously infected with a high concentration of both `ts1` and `ts2` phages and incubated at the non-permissive temperature of 42°C. The result is the formation of plaques, indicating that a productive lytic cycle occurred and functional progeny phages were released.\n\nWhich of the following genetic principles is the primary explanation for the production of functional progeny phages in this co-infection experiment?\n\nA. Genetic Recombination\nB. Complementation\nC. Generalized Transduction\nD. Lysogenic Conversion\nE. Intragenic Suppression", "solution": "We are given two temperature-sensitive mutants of bacteriophage T4:\n- ts1 has a mutation in a gene essential for viral DNA replication. At the non-permissive temperature, a ts1-only infection cannot replicate the phage genome, so the lytic cycle cannot proceed to produce progeny.\n- ts2 has a mutation in a gene essential for tail fiber assembly. At the non-permissive temperature, a ts2-only infection cannot assemble functional virions capable of infecting new cells, so plaque formation does not occur.\n\nKey principle: Complementation occurs when two different mutants, each defective in a different gene, infect the same cell and provide each other with the missing functional gene products in trans. If the affected functions are encoded by distinct genes and the gene products are diffusible or otherwise usable in the shared cytoplasm, the cell can complete a productive cycle.\n\nApply this to co-infection at the non-permissive temperature:\n1. In a co-infected cell, the ts1 genome cannot supply a functional replication factor at the non-permissive temperature, but ts2 carries a wild-type allele for that replication gene and produces a functional replication gene product. This complements ts1’s defect.\n2. Conversely, the ts2 genome cannot supply functional tail fiber proteins at the non-permissive temperature, but ts1 carries a wild-type allele for the tail fiber gene and produces functional tail fibers. This complements ts2’s defect.\n3. Because both essential functions (replication and tail fiber assembly) are provided in trans within the same cell, a full lytic cycle can proceed and functional progeny virions can be assembled and released, leading to plaque formation under the non-permissive condition.\n\nWhy the other options are not primary:\n- Genetic recombination could, in principle, generate wild-type recombinants that grow at the non-permissive temperature, but plaque formation under high-multiplicity co-infection at the restrictive temperature is classically explained by complementation, which does not require recombination. Moreover, recombination requires replication, which ts1 cannot perform on its own at the non-permissive temperature; the immediate production of functional progeny in the co-infection is directly explained by complementation.\n- Generalized transduction and lysogenic conversion are not relevant mechanisms for a strictly lytic T4 infection in this context.\n- Intragenic suppression involves second-site mutations within the same gene restoring function; here, the two mutations are in different genes and the rescue occurs by providing functional products in trans.\n\nTherefore, the primary explanation is complementation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1471112"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of the lambda phage's life cycle is a beautifully precise genetic switch that decides between immediate replication (lysis) or dormancy (lysogeny). This decision hinges on a molecular competition between two key regulatory proteins, cI and Cro. This thought experiment challenges you to predict the fate of a phage with a specific mutation in the cI repressor, forcing you to dissect the logic of this critical regulatory circuit.", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the temperate bacteriophage lambda can enter one of two life cycles upon infection: the lytic cycle or the lysogenic cycle. The decision is governed by a complex genetic switch, primarily controlled by the interplay between two key regulatory proteins: the cI repressor and the Cro protein. Both proteins compete for binding to specific DNA sequences within the right operator region, $O_R$.\n\nThe right operator, $O_R$, contains three binding sites ($O_{R1}$, $O_{R2}$, $O_{R3}$) and controls two promoters that transcribe in opposite directions: $P_R$ (promoter right) and $P_{RM}$ (promoter for repressor maintenance).\n- The cI repressor, encoded by the *cI* gene, promotes lysogeny. When cI binds to $O_{R1}$ and $O_{R2}$, it represses transcription from $P_R$ (blocking lytic genes) and simultaneously activates transcription from $P_{RM}$ (promoting its own synthesis to maintain the lysogenic state).\n- The Cro protein, encoded by the *cro* gene, promotes lysis. When Cro binds to $O_{R3}$, it represses transcription from $P_{RM}$, thereby preventing the synthesis of the cI repressor and favoring the expression of lytic genes from the $P_R$ promoter.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of the lambda phage. This strain possesses a point mutation in the *cI* gene, resulting in a cI repressor protein that is synthesized and folds into a stable tertiary structure, but its DNA-binding domain is altered such that it is completely incapable of binding to any of the operator sites. The structure and function of the Cro protein, as well as all DNA operator and promoter sequences, remain unchanged.\n\nAssuming this mutant phage infects a susceptible *E. coli* cell under physiological conditions that would normally allow for either the lytic or lysogenic pathways, what is the definitive outcome of this infection?\n\nA. The phage will exclusively establish lysogeny, creating a stable prophage.\nB. The phage will be unable to replicate its genome or produce viral particles, resulting in an aborted infection.\nC. The phage will get 'stuck' in an indeterminate state, with low-level expression of both lytic and lysogenic genes, but will not lyse the cell or form a stable prophage.\nD. The phage will exclusively enter the lytic cycle, leading to the production of new virions and lysis of the host cell.\nE. The phage will establish a defective prophage that randomly and frequently switches into the lytic cycle without an external induction signal.", "solution": "The problem asks to determine the life cycle outcome of a mutant lambda phage infection. The mutation results in a non-functional cI repressor that cannot bind to DNA, while the Cro protein and all DNA regulatory sites are normal.\n\n1.  **Initial State of Infection:** Upon injection of the phage DNA into the *E. coli* host, transcription begins from the early promoters, $P_L$ and $P_R$. Transcription from $P_R$ leads to the production of mRNA for the *cro* gene, and transcription from other early promoters leads to the production of mRNA for the *cI* gene (via the $P_{RE}$ promoter, promoter for repressor establishment, not to be confused with $P_{RM}$). Therefore, in the initial moments of infection, both Cro protein and the mutant cI protein are synthesized.\n\n2.  **Role of the Mutant cI Repressor:** The problem states that the mutant cI protein cannot bind to its operator sites. The primary functions of cI are to (a) repress the lytic promoter $P_R$ and (b) activate its own maintenance promoter $P_{RM}$. Since the mutant cI cannot bind to DNA, it fails to perform both of these critical functions. It cannot shut down the lytic pathway, and it cannot establish the positive feedback loop required to maintain the lysogenic state.\n\n3.  **Role of the Cro Protein:** The Cro protein, which is synthesized from the $P_R$ promoter, is fully functional. Its primary role in the switch is to bind to the operator site $O_{R3}$. This binding event represses transcription from the $P_{RM}$ promoter.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Competition:** In a normal infection, there's a race between cI and Cro to dominate the $O_R$ operator.\n    - If cI wins, it represses $P_R$ (stopping Cro production) and activates $P_{RM}$ (boosting its own production), locking the cell into the lysogenic state.\n    - If Cro wins, it represses $P_{RM}$ (stopping cI production), allowing the lytic genes transcribed from $P_R$ to be fully expressed, committing the cell to the lytic cycle.\n\n5.  **Consequence of the Mutation:** In this scenario, there is no competition. The mutant cI protein is a non-participant in this regulatory battle. Transcription from $P_R$ proceeds unchecked by cI. This leads to the continuous production of Cro protein and other proteins required for the lytic cycle (such as replication and capsid proteins). The functional Cro protein will bind to $O_{R3}$, actively repressing the $P_{RM}$ promoter. This action ensures that even if some initial transcription of *cI* occurred, there is no way to establish the $P_{RM}$-driven feedback loop needed for lysogeny.\n\n6.  **Definitive Outcome:** With the $P_R$ promoter active and the $P_{RM}$ promoter silenced, the genetic cascade proceeds irreversibly down the lytic pathway. The phage will replicate its DNA, synthesize new viral proteins, assemble new virions, and ultimately lyse the host cell. Therefore, the phage will exclusively enter the lytic cycle.\n\n7.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A: Incorrect. Establishing lysogeny requires a functional cI repressor to shut down lysis and maintain its own expression.\n    *   B: Incorrect. The machinery for lytic replication and particle production is transcribed from $P_R$ and downstream promoters. Since $P_R$ is active, these processes will occur.\n    *   C: Incorrect. The system is not stuck. The action of Cro actively represses the lysogenic maintenance pathway ($P_{RM}$), definitively pushing the switch towards lysis.\n    *   D: Correct. The inability of cI to repress $P_R$ and the ability of Cro to repress $P_{RM}$ ensures the lytic cycle is the only possible outcome.\n    *   E: Incorrect. A prophage cannot be established in the first place without a functional cI repressor. The concept of a prophage switching to a lytic cycle is irrelevant if lysogeny can never be achieved.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1471118"}]}
