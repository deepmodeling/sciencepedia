PKU is an autosomal recessive condition, meaning it only manifests in individuals who are homozygous for the recessive allele. Let's denote the dominant allele, which allows for normal phenylalanine metabolism, as $P$, and the recessive allele, which causes PKU, as $p$.\n\nThe man is known to be heterozygous for the gene ($Pp$). The woman has PKU. They plan to have a child. Assuming Mendelian inheritance patterns, calculate the following two probabilities:\n1. The probability that their child will be born with Phenylketonuria.\n2. The probability that their child will be a carrier of the PKU allele but will not have the condition (i.e., will be heterozygous).\n\nExpress your answers as two decimal fractions. The first value in your answer should correspond to the probability of the child having PKU, and the second value should correspond to the probability of the child being a carrier.", "solution": "PKU is autosomal recessive, so the phenotype appears only in homozygotes for the recessive allele $p$.
