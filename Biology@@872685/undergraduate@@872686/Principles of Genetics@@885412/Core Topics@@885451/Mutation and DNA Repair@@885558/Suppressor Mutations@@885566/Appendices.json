This hands-on problem challenges you to work with such a system in the model organism *C. elegans*. By predicting the fraction of viable offspring in a genetic cross involving a temperature-sensitive lethal mutation and a recessive suppressor, you will apply fundamental Mendelian principles to a realistic experimental scenario, reinforcing your understanding of how suppressors can rescue an otherwise lethal phenotype and alter expected progeny ratios [@problem_id:1524119].", "problem": "In a genetics laboratory, researchers are studying the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*. They have a true-breeding strain that is homozygous for a recessive temperature-sensitive lethal mutation, `let-7(ts)`. Worms of this strain can grow and reproduce at a permissive temperature of 15°C, but they arrest development and die at a restrictive temperature of 25°C.\n\nThrough mutagenesis and screening, a new true-breeding strain was isolated that can survive and reproduce at the restrictive temperature of 25°C. Genetic analysis revealed that this survival is due to the presence of a single, recessive suppressor mutation, `sup-1`, which is located on a different chromosome from `let-7(ts)`. The genotype of this suppressed, true-breeding strain is therefore `let-7/let-7 ; sup-1/sup-1`.\n\nTo further characterize the genetic interaction, a \"wild-type\" (N2) strain, which has the genotype `+/+ ; +/+` and is viable at all temperatures, is crossed with the suppressed strain (`let-7/let-7 ; sup-1/sup-1`). All crosses and initial rearing are performed at the permissive temperature of 15°C. The resulting F1 generation heterozygotes are then allowed to self-fertilize to produce an F2 generation.\n\nIf a large number of these F2 progeny are subsequently shifted to the restrictive temperature of 25°C as embryos, what fraction of them is expected to develop into viable, adult worms?", "solution": "Let the two unlinked loci be:\n- Locus L: wild-type allele denoted by $+$ and the recessive temperature-sensitive lethal allele by $\\text{let-7}$.

This question explores the concept of pleiotropy, where one gene influences multiple, seemingly unrelated traits.

Further analysis reveals that the original `c/c` mutation is still present and that the reversion is caused by a second, unlinked, autosomal recessive mutation called a suppressor, designated `s`. The wild-type allele at this second locus is `S`.

By leveraging the principles of P1 transduction and genetic linkage, you will design an experiment and predict its outcome, providing a clear-cut answer [@problem_id:1524076]. This problem highlights how core techniques in microbial genetics are applied to solve fundamental questions about mutation and suppression.", "problem": "A geneticist is studying an *Escherichia coli* strain that is auxotrophic for the amino acid histidine, meaning it cannot synthesize its own histidine and requires it in the growth medium. This phenotype is caused by a mutation in the `hisD` gene, making the strain's genotype `hisD-`. After treating a culture of this auxotroph with a mutagen, the geneticist isolates a \"revertant\" colony that is now prototrophic (phenotype `His+`), meaning it can grow on a Minimal Medium (MM) lacking histidine.\n\nThere are two primary hypotheses for the genetic basis of this `His+` revertant:\n1.  **True Reversion:** A back-mutation occurred at the original site, restoring the wild-type gene. The isolate's genotype is `hisD+`.\n2.  **Intergenic Suppression:** The original mutation is still present, but a new mutation in a different gene, called a suppressor, compensates for the defect. The isolate's genotype is `hisD- supE+`, where `supE+` is the suppressor allele. The suppressor gene `supE` is known to be **unlinked** to the `hisD` gene on the bacterial chromosome.\n\nTo distinguish between these two possibilities, the geneticist performs a P1 phage transduction experiment. The `His+` revertant isolate is used as the donor strain. This donor strain is also engineered to be resistant to the antibiotic streptomycin, conferred by a resistance allele `strR` that is very closely linked to the `hisD` gene. The recipient strain is the original `hisD-` auxotroph, which is sensitive to streptomycin (`strS`).\n\nThe experimental procedure is as follows: P1 phage is grown on the donor strain (`His+`, `strR`), and the resulting phage lysate is used to infect a culture of the recipient strain (`hisD-`, `strS`). The mixture is then plated on two different types of agar plates.\n\n-   **Plate 1:** Complete medium (containing histidine) supplemented with streptomycin.\n-   **Plate 2:** Minimal medium (lacking histidine) supplemented with streptomycin.\n\nAfter incubation, the geneticist observes that 1,200 colonies grew on Plate 1. Assuming the **Intergenic Suppression hypothesis** is correct, approximately how many colonies would you expect to grow on Plate 2?\n\nA. 1,200\n\nB. 900\n\nC. 600\n\nD. 300\n\nE. Close to 0", "solution": "We begin by formalizing the two hypotheses about the donor genotype and the selection design.\n\nUnder the Intergenic Suppression hypothesis, the donor strain is genotypically hisD- supE+ strR. The recipient strain is hisD- supE- strS. The P1 phage packages a single, short, contiguous fragment of donor DNA; therefore, co-transduction occurs only for loci that are closely linked on the chromosome. The marker strR is stated to be very closely linked to hisD, while the suppressor gene supE is unlinked to hisD. Thus, the probability of co-transducing supE with strR and/or hisD in a single transducing particle is effectively zero.\n\nPlate 1 (complete medium with streptomycin) selects only for acquisition of streptomycin resistance, so the number of colonies on Plate 1 (1,200) equals the number of strR transductants recovered. Because histidine is supplied, these transductants can grow regardless of their hisD or supE status. Therefore, Plate 1 gives 1,200 strR transductants.\n\nPlate 2 (minimal medium lacking histidine, with streptomycin) imposes two simultaneous requirements for growth: streptomycin resistance and the His+ phenotype. For a recipient cell to grow on Plate 2, it must (i) acquire strR to survive the antibiotic and (ii) become His+. Under the Intergenic Suppression hypothesis, the donor does not carry hisD+, only hisD-, so co-transduction of strR with hisD cannot restore His+. The only route to His+ is acquisition of the unlinked suppressor supE+.\n\nBecause P1 transduces a single contiguous fragment, selection for strR enriches for donor fragments from the str-his region. The unlinked supE+ cannot be co-transduced with strR in the same transducing particle. The only way a cell could obtain both strR and supE+ would be through two independent transduction events into the same cell, one delivering strR (linked to hisD-) and a separate one delivering supE+. The probability of this double event under standard transduction conditions is negligibly small. Let the probability that a selected strR transductant also acquires supE+ via a second, independent event be denoted by $\\epsilon$, with $\\epsilon \\approx 0$. Then the expected number of colonies on Plate 2 is\n$$\n1200 \\times \\epsilon \\approx 0.\n$$\nTherefore, under the Intergenic Suppression hypothesis, essentially no colonies are expected on Plate 2.\n\nThis reasoning matches option E (Close to 0).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1524076"}]}
