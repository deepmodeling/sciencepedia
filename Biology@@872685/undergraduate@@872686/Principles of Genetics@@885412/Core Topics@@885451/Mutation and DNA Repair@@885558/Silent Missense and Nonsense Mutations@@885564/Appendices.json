This problem challenges you to think like a geneticist and rank different mutations—nonsense, missense, and silent—based on their likelihood of causing a severe, or \"null,\" phenotype.

The researcher identifies three independent, single-nucleotide point mutations within the coding regions of the *ENZ4* gene in different patient populations. The mutations are described as follows:\n\n- **Mutation 1:** A nonsense mutation that converts a codon specifying an amino acid in exon 1 into a stop codon.\n- **Mutation 2:** A conservative missense mutation, where the altered codon specifies a new amino acid that has very similar biochemical properties (e.g., size, polarity, charge) to the original amino acid.\n- **Mutation 3:** A silent mutation, where the change in the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence results in a different codon that still specifies the exact same amino acid as the original.\n\nYour task is to rank these three mutations based on their likelihood of causing a null phenotype.

We compare the three point mutations by their typical molecular consequences and their likelihood to abolish enzymatic function.\n\nA nonsense mutation in exon 1 introduces a premature termination codon very early in the coding sequence. Such a premature stop typically triggers nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA if it is located sufficiently upstream of the final exon-exon junction, markedly reducing transcript abundance. Even if any truncated polypeptide were produced, it would lack most domains of a 500-amino-acid enzyme and almost certainly be catalytically inactive. Therefore, Mutation 1 is most likely to produce a null phenotype.\n\nA conservative missense mutation replaces one amino acid with another of similar biochemical properties. Such substitutions are often tolerated, especially outside of active or binding sites, and are less likely to abolish function than a premature stop. While some conservative changes in critical residues can impair activity, their overall probability of yielding a null phenotype is lower than that of a nonsense mutation. Thus, Mutation 2 is less likely than Mutation 1 to cause a null phenotype.\n\nA silent (synonymous) mutation does not alter the amino acid sequence. Although rare exceptions exist where synonymous changes affect splicing, mRNA stability, or translation kinetics, these are the least commonly associated with complete loss of function compared to nonsense or even conservative missense variants.
