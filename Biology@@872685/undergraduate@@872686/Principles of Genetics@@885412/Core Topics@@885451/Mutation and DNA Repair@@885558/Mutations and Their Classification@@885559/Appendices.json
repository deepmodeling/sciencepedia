{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding genetic mutations begins at the most fundamental level: the single nucleotide change. Before we can analyze the impact of a mutation on an organism, we must first classify the chemical nature of the substitution itself. This exercise challenges you to distinguish between two primary classes of point mutations—transitions and transversions—based on the molecular structure of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) bases, a foundational skill in molecular genetics [@problem_id:1505597].", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating a gene in a newly discovered species of archaea. The wild-type version of this gene contains the following short Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) sequence on its template strand:\n\n5' - GAC TGG CAT TCG - 3'\n\nIn a non-functional variant of the gene, a point mutation was identified, altering the sequence to:\n\n5' - GAC TGG CAA TCG - 3'\n\nFor reference, in DNA, Adenine (A) and Guanine (G) are classified as purines, while Cytosine (C) and Thymine (T) are classified as pyrimidines.\n\nHow would this specific nucleotide substitution be classified?\n\nA. Transition\n\nB. Transversion\n\nC. Frameshift\n\nD. Inversion\n\nE. Deletion", "solution": "We compare the wild-type template-strand sequence 5' - GAC TGG CAT TCG - 3' to the mutant 5' - GAC TGG CAA TCG - 3' to identify the precise change. The sequences are identical except at the third triplet, where \"CAT\" becomes \"CAA\". Thus, the single-nucleotide substitution is at the third position of that triplet on the template strand: T is replaced by A, i.e., T → A.\n\nUsing the given classification, Adenine (A) and Guanine (G) are purines, while Cytosine (C) and Thymine (T) are pyrimidines. Therefore, the change T → A is a pyrimidine → purine substitution.\n\nBy definition:\n- A transition is a substitution within the same base class (purine ↔ purine or pyrimidine ↔ pyrimidine), i.e., A ↔ G or C ↔ T.\n- A transversion is a substitution between different base classes (purine ↔ pyrimidine), i.e., A or G ↔ C or T.\n\nSince T (pyrimidine) → A (purine) changes base class, it is a transversion. It is not a frameshift because the sequence length is unchanged (no insertion or deletion), not an inversion because no segment is reversed, and not a deletion because no nucleotide is removed.\n\nTherefore, the substitution is classified as a transversion, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1505597"}, {"introduction": "A single change in the DNA sequence can have dramatically different outcomes for the protein it encodes. One of the most severe consequences is the premature termination of protein synthesis, leading to a truncated and often non-functional product. In this practice problem, you will analyze a specific point mutation to classify it based on this functional outcome, learning to identify what is known as a nonsense mutation [@problem_id:1505658].", "problem": "A team of geneticists is studying a heritable disorder that leads to the production of a truncated and non-functional protein. Their investigation focuses on the gene responsible for this protein. Through sequence analysis of the messenger RNA (mRNA) produced in affected individuals, they pinpoint a single nucleotide substitution as the cause. In the corresponding gene sequence from healthy individuals, a specific codon is `5'-UGG-3'`, which directs the ribosome to incorporate the amino acid Tryptophan. However, in individuals with the disorder, this codon has been altered to `5'-UGA-3'`. The `5'-UGA-3'` codon is one of the canonical termination codons that signal the ribosome to stop protein synthesis.\n\nBased on its functional consequence on the resulting polypeptide chain, which of the following best classifies this specific mutation?\n\nA. Missense mutation\n\nB. Frameshift mutation\n\nC. Silent mutation\n\nD. Nonsense mutation\n\nE. Samesense mutation", "solution": "We identify the molecular event described. The healthy codon is 5'-UGG-3', which encodes the amino acid tryptophan. In affected individuals, this codon is altered to 5'-UGA-3', which is one of the standard stop codons. This change is a single nucleotide substitution that converts a sense codon into a termination codon.\n\nThe functional consequence of substituting a sense codon with a stop codon is premature termination of translation, yielding a truncated polypeptide. By definition, a single-base substitution that produces a premature stop codon is a nonsense mutation.\n\nTo exclude the other options:\n- A missense mutation changes a codon to one that specifies a different amino acid, not a stop codon; this does not apply here because 5'-UGA-3' does not encode an amino acid.\n- A frameshift mutation results from insertion or deletion of nucleotides not in multiples of three, altering the reading frame; no insertion or deletion is described.\n- A silent mutation (synonymous) changes a codon without altering the encoded amino acid; here, the amino acid is replaced by a stop signal, so it is not silent.\n- \"Samesense mutation\" is not a standard classification distinct from synonymous/silent changes and does not fit the introduction of a stop codon.\n\nTherefore, the best classification of this specific mutation, based on its consequence of creating a premature stop codon and truncating the protein, is a nonsense mutation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1505658"}, {"introduction": "Genetics is full of fascinating puzzles, and the interplay between different mutations provides a compelling example. While a single mutation can disable a gene, a second mutation can sometimes rescue its function in a surprising way. This exercise explores the elegant concept of a suppressor mutation, where a new mutation at a different site counteracts the effect of an initial one, offering a powerful lesson in genetic compensation and the dynamic nature of the genome [@problem_id:1505665].", "problem": "A geneticist is studying a bacterial gene, `enzX`, which codes for an essential metabolic enzyme. The wild-type bacteria exhibit a normal phenotype. The geneticist isolates a non-functional mutant, designated `M1`, which is unable to grow on a minimal medium that requires the function of the `enzX` protein. DNA sequencing of the `enzX` gene in the `M1` mutant reveals a single nucleotide deletion at position +54 (relative to the start of the coding sequence).\n\nThis `M1` mutant culture is then subjected to conditions that favor the survival of any bacteria that regain `enzX` function. A new strain, designated `M2`, is isolated that can once again grow on the minimal medium, indicating at least partial restoration of enzyme function. Sequencing of the `enzX` gene in the `M2` strain reveals that the original deletion at position +54 is still present. However, a new, single nucleotide insertion is found at position +78 of the coding sequence.\n\nGiven this information, how is the second mutation (the insertion at +78) best classified in the context of its relationship to the first mutation (the deletion at +54)?\n\nA. Back mutation\n\nB. Silent mutation\n\nC. Nonsense mutation\n\nD. Suppressor mutation\n\nE. Forward mutation", "solution": "The problem asks to classify a second mutation that restores function lost due to a first mutation. Let's analyze the effects of each mutation to determine the correct classification.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first mutation.\nThe initial mutation in the `M1` strain is a single nucleotide deletion at position +54. The genetic code is read in non-overlapping triplets of nucleotides called codons. A single nucleotide deletion causes a \"frameshift.\" This means that from the point of the deletion onwards, the grouping of nucleotides into codons is shifted by one base. This shift alters every subsequent codon, leading to the incorporation of incorrect amino acids into the polypeptide chain. A frameshift mutation almost always results in a completely non-functional protein, often due to the premature creation of a stop codon in the new reading frame. This explains why the `M1` mutant is non-functional.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second mutation and its effect.\nThe `M2` strain has a second mutation: a single nucleotide insertion at position +78. Let's consider the combined effect of both mutations.\n- The deletion at +54 shifts the reading frame.\n- The region between position +54 and position +78 will be translated in this incorrect, shifted frame, resulting in a sequence of incorrect amino acids.\n- At position +78, the insertion of a single nucleotide shifts the reading frame back to the original frame. From position +78 to the end of the gene, the codons are read correctly again.\n- The resulting protein will have a short segment of incorrect amino acids (coded by the region between +54 and +78), but the remainder of the protein will have the correct, wild-type amino acid sequence. Because the majority of the protein structure is restored, it is plausible that partial or even full enzyme function is regained, as observed by the `M2` strain's ability to grow.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the given options based on the analysis.\nA. Back mutation (or reverse mutation): A back mutation would be a mutation that restores the original DNA sequence. For example, if the nucleotide at position +54 were re-inserted, perfectly reversing the initial deletion. This is not what happened; the second mutation occurred at a different site (+78). Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. Silent mutation: A silent mutation is a change in the DNA sequence that does not result in a change in the amino acid sequence of the protein (e.g., due to the redundancy of the genetic code where multiple codons specify the same amino acid). The insertion at +78, while restoring the reading frame, is part of a process that results in a segment of altered amino acids. Thus, it is not a silent mutation. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nC. Nonsense mutation: A nonsense mutation is a point mutation that results in a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated and usually non-functional protein. The insertion at +78 does not create a stop codon; on the contrary, it helps restore the functional protein. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. Suppressor mutation: A suppressor mutation is a second mutation that alleviates or \"suppresses\" the phenotypic effects of an already existing mutation. Suppressor mutations occur at a different site from the original mutation. In this case, the insertion at +78 counteracts the phenotypic effect (loss of function) of the deletion at +54 by restoring the reading frame. This perfectly fits the definition. This specific type is an intragenic suppressor (occurring within the same gene), but it falls under the general class of suppressor mutations. Therefore, this is the correct classification.\n\nE. Forward mutation: A forward mutation is a mutation that changes the wild-type phenotype to a mutant phenotype. The initial deletion was a forward mutation. The second mutation, which restores the wild-type phenotype (or close to it), is a form of reversion, not a new forward mutation. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the second mutation is a suppressor mutation because it occurs at a different site than the first mutation and suppresses its phenotypic effect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1505665"}]}
