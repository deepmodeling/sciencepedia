A frameshift mutation at position 8", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must first identify the location and nature of the change between the wild-type and mutant DNA sequences, and then classify this change as either a transition or a transversion.\n\nFirst, let's define the two classes of nitrogenous bases in DNA. The purines are Adenine (A) and Guanine (G). The pyrimidines are Cytosine (C) and Thymine (T).\n\nA point mutation is a change in a single nucleotide. Point mutations are classified as follows:\n- A **transition** is a substitution of one purine for another purine (A ↔ G) or one pyrimidine for another pyrimidine (C ↔ T).\n- A **transversion** is a substitution of a purine for a pyrimidine, or a pyrimidine for a purine (e.g., A ↔ C, A ↔ T, G ↔ C, G ↔ T).\n\nNow, let's align the two sequences and compare them base by base. We number the positions from left to right, starting at 1.\n\nPosition:      1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\nWild-type:  5'-T  A  C  G  G  T  C  C  A  G  A  G  T  T  A-3'\nMutant:     5'-T  A  C  G  G  T  C  A  A  G  A  G  T  T  A-3'\n\nBy comparing the two sequences, we can see that they are identical at all positions except for position 8. At position 8, the wild-type sequence has a Cytosine (C), while the mutant sequence has an Adenine (A).\n\nThe mutation is a change from C to A at position 8.\n- Cytosine (C) is a pyrimidine.\n- Adenine (A) is a purine.\n\nSince the substitution is from a pyrimidine (C) to a purine (A), this type of mutation is classified as a **transversion**.\n\nTherefore, the mutation is a transversion at position 8.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. A transition at position 8: The position is correct, but the classification is wrong. It's a transversion, not a transition.\nB. A transversion at position 9: The classification is correct, but the position is wrong. The mutation is at position 8.\nC. A transition at position 9: Both the classification and the position are wrong.\nD. A transversion at position 8: Both the classification (transversion) and the position (8) are correct.\nE. A frameshift mutation at position 8: A frameshift mutation is caused by an insertion or deletion of nucleotides, not a substitution. Since one base was substituted for another, this is not a frameshift mutation.\n\nThe correct description is a transversion at position 8.

This practice moves from simple DNA sequence analysis to the level of the genetic code itself, asking you to map out the mutational pathway between two different amino acid codons. By determining the types of mutations required, you'll gain insight into how the chemical nature of base substitutions can make certain evolutionary changes more or less likely than others [@problem_id:1510350].", "problem": "A molecular biologist is analyzing a specific enzyme active site. The wild-type version of the enzyme in one organism has a Methionine residue at a critical position. In a related, newly discovered extremophile, the corresponding residue is a Cysteine, which is thought to contribute to the enzyme's stability under harsh conditions.\n\nTo understand the evolutionary steps that might have led to this substitution, the biologist examines the underlying genetic code. The specific messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) codon for Methionine in the wild-type organism is AUG. The corresponding codon for Cysteine in the extremophile is UGU.\n\nIn the context of point mutations, nucleotides are categorized as purines (Adenine, A; Guanine, G) and pyrimidines (Cytosine, C; Uracil, U). A *transition* is a point mutation that substitutes a purine for another purine (A ↔ G) or a pyrimidine for another pyrimidine (C ↔ U). A *transversion* is a point mutation that substitutes a purine for a pyrimidine, or vice versa.\n\nAssuming the transformation from the codon AUG to the codon UGU occurred via the minimum number of sequential point mutations, determine the required number of transitions and transversions.\n\nExpress your answer as a row matrix `[N_trans, N_transv]`, where `N_trans` is the total number of transitions and `N_transv` is the total number of transversions.", "solution": "We compare the initial codon $s_{1}=\\text{AUG}$ and the target codon $s_{2}=\\text{UGU}$ position by position.

You must apply your knowledge of mutation specificity to predict whether a particular chemical can be detected as a mutagen, demonstrating how fundamental molecular principles directly guide experimental strategy and data interpretation in the lab.", "problem": "In molecular genetics, point mutations are categorized based on the type of base substitution. A **transition** is a substitution of a purine for another purine (Adenine ↔ Guanine) or a pyrimidine for another pyrimidine (Cytosine ↔ Thymine). A **transversion** is a substitution of a purine for a pyrimidine or vice versa (e.g., Adenine ↔ Cytosine).\n\nA genetics student is using the Ames test to screen a new chemical, Compound Z, for mutagenic properties. The test utilizes a special strain of *Salmonella typhimurium* that is an auxotroph for histidine, meaning it cannot grow on a medium lacking this amino acid. This auxotrophic phenotype is the result of a single point mutation in the *hisD* gene. The wild-type gene at this position contains the codon 5'-GGC-3' (encoding the amino acid Glycine), which is part of the active site of the enzyme. The student's tester strain has suffered a G-to-T transversion at the first position of this codon, creating the mutant codon 5'-TGC-3' (encoding Cysteine). This single amino acid change completely inactivates the enzyme.\n\nThe student's research suggests that if Compound Z is mutagenic, it exclusively causes transition mutations. Assuming that only a true reversion of the mutant Cysteine codon back to the wild-type Glycine codon can restore enzyme function and thus allow the bacteria to grow on the histidine-lacking medium, which of the following conclusions is the most appropriate for the student to draw about the expected outcome of the experiment?\n\nA. Compound Z will be identified as a potent mutagen because a transition mutation on the template strand will restore the original GGC codon.\n\nB. Compound Z will not be identified as a mutagen using this specific tester strain, as a transition mutation cannot cause the necessary T-to-G reversion.\n\nC. The test will be inconclusive because the rate of spontaneous reversion from TGC back to GGC is high enough to mask any effect from Compound Z.\n\nD. Compound Z will be identified as a weak mutagen because a transition at the third position of the codon (C to T) could potentially restore enzyme function.\n\nE. The Ames test is not suitable because Compound Z causes transitions, which are generally less harmful than transversions and do not typically lead to prototrophic reversion.", "solution": "A transition is a base substitution within the same class: purine to purine (A ↔ G) or pyrimidine to pyrimidine (C ↔ T). A transversion is a base substitution between classes: purine to pyrimidine or pyrimidine to purine (A or G ↔ C or T).\n\nThe wild-type coding-strand codon is 5'-GGC-3' (Gly). The tester strain’s mutant coding-strand codon is 5'-TGC-3' (Cys), produced by a G-to-T transversion at the first position relative to the wild type. To achieve a true reversion restoring enzyme function under the stated assumption, the mutant codon 5'-TGC-3' must be changed back exactly to 5'-GGC-3'.\n\nComparing 5'-TGC-3' to 5'-GGC-3':\n- Second position: G → G, already identical.\n- Third position: C → C, already identical.\n- First position: T must change to G.\n\nThe required change at the first position is T → G. Since T is a pyrimidine and G is a purine, T → G is a transversion, not a transition.\n\nBecause Compound Z is assumed to cause exclusively transitions, it cannot effect the necessary T → G transversion. Therefore, under the stated condition that only a true reversion to 5'-GGC-3' restores function, Compound Z will not produce revertants and will not be identified as a mutagen using this tester strain.\n\nAddressing the distractors:\n- Option A incorrectly claims a transition on the template strand could restore the original codon. The template of TGC is ACG; reverting to GGC requires template CCG, which at the first position is A → C, a purine-to-pyrimidine transversion, not a transition.\n- Option C is unjustified; spontaneous true reversion rates at a specific base are typically low and cannot be assumed to mask effects, especially when the mutagen cannot cause the required change.\n- Option D suggests a transition at the third position (C → T) could restore function. Changing TGC to TGT is still Cys, not Gly, and thus does not restore function; moreover, the problem stipulates only true reversion to GGC restores activity.\n- Option E is incorrect in its rationale; the key issue is not the general severity of transitions but the specificity that only a transversion (T → G) can achieve the required true reversion here.\n\nThus, the correct conclusion is that Compound Z will not be identified as a mutagen with this tester strain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1510353"}]}
