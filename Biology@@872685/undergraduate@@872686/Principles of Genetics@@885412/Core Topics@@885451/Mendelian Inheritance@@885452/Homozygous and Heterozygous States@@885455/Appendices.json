This first exercise takes us back to Mendel's foundational experiments, focusing on the creation of a genetically uniform F1 generation. By determining the necessary parental cross to ensure all offspring are heterozygous, you will solidify your understanding of fundamental concepts like 'true-breeding,' 'homozygous,' and 'heterozygous' and their roles in simple inheritance.", "problem": "A team of marine biologists is studying the genetics of a fictional deep-sea jellyfish, *Chrysaora noctiluca*. They observe that the jellyfish's bell can have one of two textures: smooth or gelatinous. This trait is determined by a single gene that follows simple Mendelian inheritance patterns. The allele for a smooth bell ($S$) is completely dominant over the allele for a gelatinous bell ($s$).\n\nThe research team wants to conduct a specific cross to produce a new generation of jellyfish (the F1 generation) that are all genetically uniform for this bell texture gene. Furthermore, if any two individuals from this F1 generation are crossed with each other, they must be capable of producing offspring with both smooth and gelatinous bells.\n\nWhich of the following parental crosses is required to reliably produce an F1 generation that meets these specific criteria?\n\nA. A cross between a jellyfish with a smooth bell and a jellyfish with a gelatinous bell.\n\nB. A cross between two jellyfish, both of which have a smooth bell but had one parent with a gelatinous bell.\n\nC. A cross between a true-breeding smooth-belled jellyfish and a true-breeding gelatinous-belled jellyfish.\n\nD. A cross between two true-breeding smooth-belled jellyfish.", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the specific parental cross that will produce an F1 generation where all individuals are genetically identical for the bell-texture gene, and which, when interbred, can produce offspring of both phenotypes. Let's analyze the genetics of the system first.\n\nThe gene for bell texture has two alleles:\n- $S$: The dominant allele for a smooth bell.\n- $s$: The recessive allele for a gelatinous bell.\n\nThe possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes are:\n- $SS$: Homozygous dominant, resulting in a smooth bell.\n- $Ss$: Heterozygous, also resulting in a smooth bell due to the dominance of the $S$ allele.\n- $ss$: Homozygous recessive, resulting in a gelatinous bell.\n\nThe term \"true-breeding\" means an organism is homozygous for a particular trait. Therefore:\n- A true-breeding smooth-belled jellyfish has the genotype $SS$.\n- A true-breeding gelatinous-belled jellyfish has the genotype $ss$.\n\nThe problem has two conditions for the F1 generation:\n1. All individuals must be genetically uniform (have the same genotype for this gene).\n2. When interbred, they must be able to produce offspring with both smooth ($S\\_$) and gelatinous ($ss$) phenotypes.\n\nFor the second condition to be met, the F1 individuals must be able to produce gametes carrying the $s$ allele. If an F1 individual were $SS$, it could only produce $S$ gametes and could never have $ss$ offspring. Therefore, the F1 individuals must carry the $s$ allele. They must also carry the $S$ allele to potentially produce smooth-belled offspring. The only genotype that satisfies this is the heterozygous genotype, $Ss$. A cross between two heterozygous individuals ($Ss \\times Ss$) produces offspring with genotypes $SS$, $Ss$, and $ss$ in a 1:2:1 ratio, which corresponds to smooth and gelatinous phenotypes.\n\nThus, the goal is to find a parental cross that guarantees 100% of the offspring will have the heterozygous genotype ($Ss$). Let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **A cross between a jellyfish with a smooth bell and a jellyfish with a gelatinous bell.**\nThe smooth-belled parent could be $SS$ or $Ss$. The gelatinous-belled parent must be $ss$.\n- If the cross is $SS \\times ss$, all offspring will be $Ss$. This meets the condition.\n- If the cross is $Ss \\times ss$, the offspring will be 50% $Ss$ and 50% $ss$. This does not produce a genetically uniform F1 generation.\nSince this cross does not *guarantee* the desired outcome, option A is incorrect.\n\nB. **A cross between two jellyfish, both of which have a smooth bell but had one parent with a gelatinous bell.**\nA jellyfish with a smooth bell that had a parent with a gelatinous bell ($ss$) must have inherited an $s$ allele from that parent. To have a smooth bell, it must also have an $S$ allele. Therefore, both parents in this cross are heterozygous ($Ss$).\n- The cross is $Ss \\times Ss$.\n- The offspring genotypes are 25% $SS$, 50% $Ss$, and 25% $ss$. This F1 generation is not genetically uniform. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\nC. **A cross between a true-breeding smooth-belled jellyfish and a true-breeding gelatinous-belled jellyfish.**\nThis explicitly defines the genotypes of the parents.\n- The true-breeding smooth parent is $SS$.\n- The true-breeding gelatinous parent is $ss$.\n- The cross is $SS \\times ss$.\nThe $SS$ parent can only produce gametes containing the $S$ allele. The $ss$ parent can only produce gametes containing the $s$ allele. Upon fertilization, all offspring will have the genotype $Ss$. This F1 generation is 100% heterozygous and thus genetically uniform. As established, these $Ss$ individuals can produce offspring with both phenotypes when interbred. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nD. **A cross between two true-breeding smooth-belled jellyfish.**\nThis means crossing two homozygous dominant individuals.\n- The cross is $SS \\times SS$.\n- All offspring will have the genotype $SS$. While this F1 generation is genetically uniform, these individuals can only produce gametes with the $S$ allele. If interbred ($SS \\times SS$), they can only produce $SS$ offspring. They cannot produce offspring with the gelatinous ($ss$) phenotype. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, only the cross described in option C guarantees an F1 generation that meets both specified criteria.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1497840"}, {"introduction": "Having explored how to create heterozygous individuals ([@problem_id:1497840]), we now test the robustness of this genetic state. This thought experiment uses the horticultural technique of grafting to question where an organism's genetic identity resides. You will need to consider whether the genotype of a grafted branch is influenced by its rootstock, thereby clarifying that an organism's gametes are determined solely by the genotype of the tissue from which they arise.", "problem": "In a horticultural experiment, a student studies the inheritance of stem height in pea plants. The allele for tall stems ($T$) is completely dominant over the allele for dwarf stems ($t$). The student takes a scion, which is a young shoot, from a mature pea plant that is heterozygous for the height gene ($Tt$). This scion is then carefully grafted onto the rootstock of a different pea plant that is homozygous recessive and thus has a dwarf phenotype ($tt$). The graft is successful, and the scion develops into a healthy, mature branch which eventually produces flowers.\n\nAssuming that the grafting procedure does not induce any new mutations, which of the following options correctly describes the genotype(s) of the pollen grains produced by the flowers on the grafted scion?\n\nA. Only pollen with the genotype $T$.\n\nB. Only pollen with the genotype $t$.\n\nC. Pollen with genotypes $T$ and $t$.\n\nD. Only pollen with the genotype $Tt$.\n\nE. Pollen with genotypes $Tt$ and $tt$.", "solution": "The core of this problem is to understand the genetic relationship between a scion and a rootstock in a graft, and how gametes are formed.\n\nFirst, we must identify the source of the pollen. The problem asks for the genotype of pollen produced by the flowers on the grafted scion. Flowers, and the reproductive cells they contain, are generated from the mitotic division and subsequent differentiation of the cells of the branch on which they grow. In this case, that branch is the scion.\n\nSecond, we must establish the genotype of the scion tissue. The problem explicitly states that the scion was taken from a heterozygous tall pea plant with the genotype $Tt$. Therefore, every cell in the scion, including those that will develop into the floral organs, has the genotype $Tt$.\n\nThird, we must consider the effect of grafting. Grafting is a physical fusion of tissues from two different plants. The scion and rootstock are joined, allowing the vascular systems (xylem and phloem) to connect, enabling the transport of water and nutrients. However, grafting does not involve the fusion of genetic material. The cells of the scion remain genetically distinct from the cells of the rootstock. The DNA of the $tt$ rootstock does not alter the DNA of the $Tt$ scion.\n\nFourth, we analyze the process of gamete formation (specifically, pollen formation or microsporogenesis) in the scion's flowers. Pollen grains are male gametes and are haploid, meaning they contain only one set of chromosomes. They are produced through the process of meiosis from diploid precursor cells (microspore mother cells) in the anthers of the flower. Since the flower is part of the scion, these precursor cells have the genotype $Tt$.\n\nFifth, we apply Mendel's Law of Segregation. During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate. In this case, the chromosome carrying the dominant allele $T$ will segregate from the homologous chromosome carrying the recessive allele $t$. As a result, the haploid cells produced at the end of meiosis will contain either the $T$ allele or the $t$ allele, but not both.\n\nTherefore, the diploid ($Tt$) cells in the anthers of the scion's flowers will produce two types of haploid pollen grains in approximately equal proportions: half of the pollen will have the genotype $T$, and the other half will have the genotype $t$. The genotype of the rootstock ($tt$) is irrelevant to the genetic makeup of the gametes produced by the scion.\n\nComparing this conclusion to the given options:\n- A. Only pollen with the genotype $T$. This is incorrect, as the $t$ allele will also be passed on.\n- B. Only pollen with the genotype $t$. This is incorrect, as the $T$ allele will also be passed on. This might be chosen if one mistakenly believes the rootstock influences the scion's gametes.\n- C. Pollen with genotypes $T$ and $t$. This is correct, as meiosis in a $Tt$ individual produces both $T$ and $t$ gametes.\n- D. Only pollen with the genotype $Tt$. This is incorrect. Pollen grains are haploid gametes; $Tt$ is a diploid genotype.\n- E. Pollen with genotypes $Tt$ and $tt$. This is incorrect for the same reason as D; it confuses diploid zygotic genotypes with haploid gamete genotypes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1497841"}, {"introduction": "This final practice builds on the concept of a stable heterozygous genotype ([@problem_id:1497841]) to explore its profound implications for genetic diversity. When an organism is heterozygous for one gene, it can produce two types of gametes; this exercise asks you to quantify the exponential increase in variation as we consider multiple heterozygous genes. This calculation reveals how heterozygosity serves as a powerful engine for creating the genetic novelty essential for evolution and selective breeding.", "problem": "A plant geneticist is studying a newly cultivated variety of pea plant. This particular plant is heterozygous for four distinct genes, each located on a different chromosome, ensuring they assort independently during meiosis. The genes are as follows:\n\n-   Controlling seed shape (Alleles: $R$ for round, $r$ for wrinkled)\n-   Controlling seed color (Alleles: $Y$ for yellow, $y$ for green)\n-   Controlling flower color (Alleles: $P$ for purple, $p$ for white)\n-   Controlling plant height (Alleles: $T$ for tall, $t$ for dwarf)\n\nThe genotype of this plant is therefore $RrYyPpTt$. During the formation of gametes (pollen and ovules), these alleles are segregated. Calculate the total number of unique gamete genotypes that this single plant can produce with respect to these four genes.", "solution": "The plant has genotype $RrYyPpTt$, meaning it is heterozygous at four loci that assort independently because each gene is on a different chromosome. By Mendel's law of segregation, each gamete receives one allele from each gene pair. Because each locus is heterozygous, there are exactly $2$ allele options per locus for any given gamete.\n\nBy the multiplication principle for independent choices, if there are $2$ independent choices at each of $4$ loci, the total number of distinct gamete genotypes is\n$$\nN=\\prod_{i=1}^{4} 2=2^{4}.\n$$\nEvaluating this power gives\n$$\n2^{4}=16.\n$$\nTherefore, the plant can produce $16$ unique gamete genotypes with respect to these four genes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16}$$", "id": "1497837"}]}
