This distance is measured in map units (m.u.) or centiMorgans (cM), where 1% recombination frequency is equivalent to 1 cM.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given two recombination frequencies:\n1. Recombination frequency between gene `T` and gene `P` = 22%. This corresponds to a map distance of 22 cM. Let's denote this as $d(T, P) = 22$ cM.\n2. Recombination frequency between gene `P` and gene `S` = 16%. This corresponds to a map distance of 16 cM. Let's denote this as $d(P, S) = 16$ cM.\n\nTo determine the linear order of the three genes (T, P, S), we must consider all three possibilities for which gene lies in the middle. The total distance between the two outer (flanking) genes must equal the sum of the distances of the smaller segments defined by the middle gene.\n\n**Case 1: Assume gene `P` is in the middle.**\nIf `P` is the middle gene, the order would be T-P-S (or its equivalent reverse, S-P-T).\nThe distance between the two flanking genes, `T` and `S`, would be the sum of the intermediate distances:\n$d(T, S) = d(T, P) + d(P, S)$\n$d(T, S) = 22 \\text{ cM} + 16 \\text{ cM} = 38 \\text{ cM}$\nSince this results in a positive, physically meaningful distance, the order T-P-S is a valid possibility. Therefore, gene `P` could be the middle gene.\n\n**Case 2: Assume gene `T` is in the middle.**\nIf `T` is the middle gene, the order would be P-T-S (or S-T-P).\nIn this arrangement, the largest distance would be between the flanking genes `P` and `S`. The given distances must satisfy the relationship:\n$d(P, S) = d(P, T) + d(T, S)$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$16 \\text{ cM} = 22 \\text{ cM} + d(T, S)$\nSolving for the unknown distance $d(T, S)$:\n$d(T, S) = 16 \\text{ cM} - 22 \\text{ cM} = -6 \\text{ cM}$\nA negative map distance is physically impossible. Therefore, the order P-T-S is not a valid possibility, and gene `T` cannot be the middle gene.\n\n**Case 3: Assume gene `S` is in the middle.**\nIf `S` is the middle gene, the order would be T-S-P (or P-S-T).\nIn this arrangement, the largest distance would be between the flanking genes `T` and `P`. The given distances must satisfy the relationship:\n$d(T, P) = d(T, S) + d(S, P)$\nNote that $d(S, P)$ is the same as $d(P, S)$. Substituting the known values:\n$22 \\text{ cM} = d(T, S) + 16 \\text{ cM}$\nSolving for the unknown distance $d(T, S)$:\n$d(T, S) = 22 \\text{ cM} - 16 \\text{ cM} = 6 \\text{ cM}$\nSince this results in a positive, physically meaningful distance, the order T-S-P is a valid possibility. Therefore, gene `S` could be the middle gene.\n\nBased on our analysis, there are two possible gene orders consistent with the data: T-P-S and T-S-P. In the first case, `P` is the middle gene. In the second case, `S` is the middle gene. Thus, either gene `P` or gene `S` could be in the middle.

The total number of offspring is 2000.\n\n1.  **Identify Parental, SCO, and DCO Classes**:\n    -   Parental (non-recombinant) classes are the two most frequent phenotypes. These correspond to the gametes produced by the F1 parent without any crossing over.\n        -   Purple, Fragrant, Spiny: 623\n        -   pink, faint, smooth: 622\n        -   Total Parental = 623 + 622 = 1245.\n    -   Double crossover (DCO) classes are the two least frequent phenotypes. These result from a crossover event in both regions between the three genes.\n        -   Purple, faint, Spiny: 23\n        -   pink, Fragrant, smooth: 22\n        -   Total DCO = 23 + 22 = 45.\n    -   Single crossover (SCO) classes are the remaining four intermediate-frequency phenotypes.\n\n2.  **Determine the Gene Order**:\n    To find the gene order, we compare the allele combination of the parental (non-recombinant) classes with the double crossover (DCO) classes. The parental gametes are `PFS` and `pfs` (the most frequent). The DCO gametes are `PfS` and `pFs` (the least frequent). Comparing a parental gamete (e.g., `PFS`) with a DCO gamete (`PfS`) shows that the alleles for the outer genes (`P` and `S`) are the same, while the allele for the middle gene (`F`/`f`) has been swapped. This indicates that the Fragrance gene (F) is located in the middle. The correct gene order is therefore P-F-S.\n\n3.  **Categorize SCO Classes and Calculate Recombination Frequencies**:\n    Now that we know the gene order is $P-F-S$, we can identify the two SCO classes based on the phenotypes. Since this is a test cross, the phenotype reveals the gamete from the heterozygous parent.\n    -   SCO between $P$ and $F$ (Region I): These offspring result from a single crossover between the $P$ and $F$ genes. The corresponding gametes are `pFS` and `Pfs`.\n        -   pink, Fragrant, Spiny (`pFS`): 128\n        -   Purple, faint, smooth (`Pfs`): 127\n        -   Total SCO Region I = 128 + 127 = 255.\n    -   SCO between $F$ and $S$ (Region II): These offspring result from a single crossover between the $F$ and $S$ genes. The corresponding gametes are `PFs` and `pfS`.\n        -   Purple, Fragrant, smooth (`PFs`): 228\n        -   pink, faint, Spiny (`pfS`): 227\n        -   Total SCO Region II = 228 + 227 = 455.\n\n    The recombination frequency (RF) for a region is calculated as the sum of SCOs in that region and all DCOs, divided by the total number of offspring.\n    -   RF for Region I ($P-F$):\n        $$ \\text{RF}_{P-F} = \\frac{\\text{SCO}_{\\text{I}} + \\text{DCO}}{\\text{Total Offspring}} = \\frac{255 + 45}{2000} = \\frac{300}{2000} = 0.15 $$\n        The map distance between $P$ and $F$ is $0.15 \\times 100 = 15$ cM.\n\n    -   RF for Region II ($F-S$):\n        $$ \\text{RF}_{F-S} = \\frac{\\text{SCO}_{\\text{II}} + \\text{DCO}}{\\text{Total Offspring}} = \\frac{455 + 45}{2000} = \\frac{500}{2000} = 0.25 $$\n        The map distance between $F$ and $S$ is $0.25 \\times 100 = 25$ cM.\n\n4.  **Calculate Interference**:\n    Interference ($I$) measures the degree to which a crossover event in one region affects the likelihood of a crossover event in an adjacent region. It is calculated as $I = 1 - C$, where $C$ is the coefficient of coincidence.\n\n    The coefficient of coincidence ($C$) is the ratio of the observed frequency of double crossovers to the expected frequency of double crossovers.\n    -   Observed DCO frequency:\n        $$ \\text{Observed DCO Freq} = \\frac{\\text{Total DCO}}{\\text{Total Offspring}} = \\frac{45}{2000} = 0.0225 $$\n    -   Expected DCO frequency: This is the product of the recombination frequencies of the two adjacent regions, assuming the crossover events are independent.\n        $$ \\text{Expected DCO Freq} = \\text{RF}_{P-F} \\times \\text{RF}_{F-S} = 0.15 \\times 0.25 = 0.0375 $$\n    -   Coefficient of Coincidence ($C$):\n        $$ C = \\frac{\\text{Observed DCO Freq}}{\\text{Expected DCO Freq}} = \\frac{0.0225}{0.0375} = 0.6 $$\n    -   Interference ($I$):\n        $$ I = 1 - C = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4 $$\n\n    Rounding the result to three significant figures gives 0.400.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.400}$$", "id": "1492711"}, {"introduction": "Genetic analysis often encounters biological phenomena that violate simple Mendelian expectations, requiring a deeper level of critical thinking. This advanced problem [@problem_id:1492760] presents a scenario complicated by meiotic drive, a mechanism where one allele is transmitted more frequently than expected.

A trihybrid individual, known to be derived from parental stocks of `P C W / P C W` and `p c w / p c w`, is test-crossed with a `p c w / p c w` individual.\n\nThe geneticist observes an unusual inheritance pattern. It is known that a meiotic drive element is very tightly linked to the `c` locus. In heterozygous `Cc` individuals, meiosis is distorted such that the chromosome carrying the `c` allele is passed on to 75% of the functional gametes, while the chromosome carrying the `C` allele is passed on to the remaining 25%.\n\nThe test cross produces a total of 1000 progeny with the following phenotypes:\n- Plain, Straight, Weak (`Pcw`): 66\n- Patterned, Curved, Whole (`pCW`): 22\n- Plain, Curved, Weak (`PCw`): 47\n- Patterned, Straight, Whole (`pcW`): 141\n- Plain, Curved, Whole (`PCW`): 178\n- Patterned, Straight, Weak (`pcw`): 534\n- Plain, Straight, Whole (`PcW`): 9\n- Patterned, Curved, Weak (`pCw`): 3\n\nThe map distance in centimorgans (cM) is defined as the average number of crossover events occurring in an interval per 100 meioses.

Report your answer in cM, rounded to the nearest whole number.", "solution": "The core of this problem is to correct the observed progeny counts, which are distorted by meiotic drive, to uncover the true frequencies of gametes produced by meiosis. Once we have the true gamete frequencies, we can perform a standard three-point test cross analysis to determine the map distance.\n\nStep 1: Understand and model the meiotic drive.\nThe problem states that in the `Cc` trihybrid, gametes receive the `c` chromosome 75% of the time and the `C` chromosome 25% of the time. In a normal meiosis, both would be transmitted 50% of the time. This means the observed frequency of any gamete class containing the `c` allele is artificially inflated, while the frequency of any gamete class with the `C` allele is artificially deflated.\n\nLet `f_{true}(gamete_i)` be the frequency of a given gamete `i` produced by meiosis before the drive effect. Let `f_{obs}(gamete_i)` be the final observed frequency in the progeny.\nThe sum of true frequencies for all `c`-bearing gametes is `\\sum f_{true}(c-gametes) = 0.5`.\nThe sum of true frequencies for all `C`-bearing gametes is `\\sum f_{true}(C-gametes) = 0.5`.\n\nThe drive skews these so that the total observed proportion of `c`-gametes is 0.75 and `C`-gametes is 0.25.\nThe scaling factor for any `c`-bearing gamete is the ratio of final proportion to initial proportion: `Factor_c = 0.75 / 0.50 = 1.5`.\nThe scaling factor for any `C`-bearing gamete is `Factor_C = 0.25 / 0.50 = 0.5`.\n\nTherefore, for any gamete type `i`:\n- If it has allele `c`: `N_{obs}(i) \\propto 1.5 \\times N_{true}(i)`\n- If it has allele `C`: `N_{obs}(i) \\propto 0.5 \\times N_{true}(i)`\n\nStep 2: Correct the observed progeny counts.\nTo find the true relative numbers of gametes produced by meiosis (`N_{true}`), we must reverse the distortion. We can do this by dividing the observed counts of `c`-bearing progeny by 1.5 and `C`-bearing progeny by 0.5. An equivalent and arithmetically simpler method is to establish a common baseline. Let's scale the `C`-bearing progeny counts up so they are comparable to the `c`-bearing progeny counts. The relative distortion between `c` and `C` gametes is `Factor_c / Factor_C = 1.5 / 0.5 = 3`. This means a `c`-gamete is three times more likely to be observed than a `C`-gamete that was produced at the same initial meiotic frequency.\n\nTo correct for this, we multiply the counts of all `C`-bearing progeny by 3.\n\nObserved counts for `c`-bearing progeny (no change for this step):\n- `Pcw` (Plain, Straight, Weak): 66\n- `pcW` (Patterned, Straight, Whole): 141\n- `pcw` (Patterned, Straight, Weak): 534\n- `PcW` (Plain, Straight, Whole): 9\n\nObserved counts for `C`-bearing progeny:\n- `pCW` (Patterned, Curved, Whole): 22\n- `PCw` (Plain, Curved, Weak): 47\n- `PCW` (Plain, Curved, Whole): 178\n- `pCw` (Patterned, Curved, Weak): 3\n\nApplying the correction factor of 3 to the `C`-bearing classes:\n- Corrected `pCW`: `22 \\times 3 = 66`\n- Corrected `PCw`: `47 \\times 3 = 141`\n- Corrected `PCW`: `178 \\times 3 = 534`\n- Corrected `pCw`: `3 \\times 3 = 9`\n\nNow we have a full set of corrected relative counts that reflect the true meiotic output:\n- `PCW`: 534\n- `pcw`: 534\n- `pCW`: 66\n- `Pcw`: 66\n- `PCw`: 141\n- `pcW`: 141\n- `pCw`: 9\n- `PcW`: 9\n\nStep 3: Perform a three-point cross analysis on the corrected data.\nThe trihybrid parent had the genotype `P C W / p c w`.\nWe can now identify the gamete classes based on their frequencies:\n- **Non-crossover (NCO)** / Parental: The most frequent classes.\n  - `PCW`: 534\n  - `pcw`: 534\n  - Total NCO = `534 + 534 = 1068`\n- **Double crossover (DCO)**: The least frequent classes.

A single crossover event (SCO) counts as one crossover. A double crossover event (DCO) involves two crossover events. Therefore, the total number of crossover events is `N_{SCO1} + N_{SCO2} + 2 \\times N_{DCO}`.\n\nTotal crossover events = `132 + 282 + 2 \\times 18`\nTotal crossover events = `132 + 282 + 36 = 450`\n\nThe frequency of crossover events between `p` and `w` is the total number of crossover events divided by the total number of progeny:\nFrequency = `450 / 1500 = 0.30`\n\nTo express this as a map distance in centimorgans, we multiply the frequency by 100:\nMap distance = `0.30 \\times 100 = 30` cM.\n\nAlternatively, one can calculate the distances for the two sub-intervals and add them:\n`d(p-c) = (SCO1 + DCO) / Total \\times 100 = (132 + 18) / 1500 \\times 100 = 150 / 1500 \\times 100 = 10` cM.\n`d(c-w) = (SCO2 + DCO) / Total \\times 100 = (282 + 18) / 1500 \\times 100 = 300 / 1500 \\times 100 = 20` cM.\nTotal map distance `d(p-w) = d(p-c) + d(c-w) = 10 + 20 = 30` cM.\n\nThe question asks for the answer rounded to the nearest whole number, which is 30.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{30}$$", "id": "1492760"}]}
