This first practice problem [@problem_id:1508242] challenges you to apply the core definition of penetrance to a population of organisms. By calculating the expected number of individuals who do not express a trait despite carrying the necessary allele, you will solidify the concept of penetrance as a key statistical tool in genetics.", "problem": "In the field of genetics, penetrance refers to the proportion of individuals carrying a particular variant of a gene (genotype) that also express an associated trait (phenotype). A newly discovered deep-sea crustacean, *Cryoluxa profunda*, possesses a dominant allele, `F`, which is responsible for producing a fluorescent protein that makes the organism glow under specific frequencies of blue light. However, this trait exhibits incomplete penetrance.\n\nA research team is studying a captive population of *Cryoluxa profunda*. They have genetically screened a sample of 350 individuals and confirmed that every one of them carries at least one copy of the dominant `F` allele. Previous large-scale studies have established that the penetrance for the fluorescence phenotype associated with the `F` allele is 86%. It is also noted that among the crustaceans that do fluoresce, the intensity of the glow varies significantly from one individual to another.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the number of individuals in the screened sample that are expected to show no fluorescence.", "solution": "Penetrance is the probability that a carrier of the allele expresses the phenotype. Let $p$ denote the penetrance for fluorescence among carriers of the dominant $F$ allele. From the problem, $p=0.86$. The fraction of carriers who do not express the phenotype is therefore $1-p$, which equals $1-0.86=0.14$.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of genetically confirmed carriers in the sample. From the problem, $N=350$. The expected number of non-fluorescent individuals is then given by the product of the total number of carriers and the non-expression fraction:\n$$\nN_{\\text{non-fluorescent}}=N\\,(1-p)=350\\times 0.14.\n$$\nCarrying out the multiplication,\n$$\n350\\times 0.14=49.\n$$\nTherefore, the expected number of individuals showing no fluorescence is $49$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{49}$$", "id": "1508242"}, {"introduction": "Genetic traits rarely exist in isolation. This next exercise [@problem_id:1508239] elevates the challenge by incorporating incomplete penetrance into a classic dihybrid cross. You will learn how to adjust expected Mendelian ratios to account for the probability that a dominant allele may not be expressed, a crucial skill for predicting phenotypic outcomes in more complex, realistic genetic scenarios.", "problem": "In a genetic study of a fictional species, the Glimmerwing Butterfly (*Luminoptera ficta*), researchers are investigating two distinct, independently assorting traits: bioluminescence and wing pattern.\n\nThe ability to produce bioluminescence is controlled by the Lumi-1 gene. The dominant allele, $L$, confers the potential for luminescence, while the recessive allele, $l$, does not. However, the expression of the dominant allele is subject to incomplete penetrance. An individual with at least one $L$ allele (genotypes $LL$ or $Ll$) has a probability $P_L = 0.75$ of actually being luminescent. Individuals with the $ll$ genotype are never luminescent.\n\nThe wing pattern is controlled by the Stripe-Gene, which exhibits complete Mendelian dominance. The allele for striped wings, $S$, is dominant to the allele for solid-colored wings, $s$.\n\nTwo butterflies, both heterozygous for both genes (genotype $LlSs$), are crossed. Assuming the two genes are located on different chromosomes, what is the probability that an offspring from this cross will be non-luminescent and have striped wings? Provide your answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "Let the two loci assort independently. For the luminescence locus from $Ll \\times Ll$, Mendelian segregation gives\n$$P(LL)=\\frac{1}{4},\\quad P(Ll)=\\frac{1}{2},\\quad P(ll)=\\frac{1}{4},$$\nso $P(\\text{L-})=P(LL\\ \\text{or}\\ Ll)=\\frac{3}{4}$. With incomplete penetrance, an $\\text{L-}$ individual is luminescent with probability $P_{L}$ and non-luminescent with probability $1-P_{L}$, while an $ll$ individual is always non-luminescent.

This advanced problem [@problem_id:1508253] puts you in the role of a research geneticist faced with ambiguous data. You will use logical deduction to see how a carefully designed series of crosses can distinguish between incomplete penetrance and other phenomena like partial lethality, demonstrating how to use genetics to rigorously test hypotheses.", "problem": "In the fictional beetle *Coleoptera magnificus*, a dominant allele `D` causes the presence of iridescent spots on the elytra (wing covers), while the recessive allele `d` results in a plain, non-iridescent phenotype.\n\nA geneticist performs an initial cross between a beetle from a true-breeding iridescent line ($DD$) and a beetle from a true-breeding plain line ($dd$), generating an F1 generation. All F1 individuals are iridescent ($Dd$), confirming the dominance of the `D` allele.\n\nNext, the geneticist performs a backcross by mating F1 iridescent beetles ($Dd$) with beetles from the true-breeding plain line ($dd$). Analyzing a large number of progeny from this backcross, the geneticist observes a deviation from the expected 1:1 Mendelian ratio of iridescent to plain beetles.\n\nTwo hypotheses are proposed to explain this deviation:\n1.  **Incomplete Penetrance:** The `D` allele has a penetrance $P$ (where $0 < P < 1$), meaning only a fraction $P$ of individuals with at least one `D` allele actually express the iridescent phenotype. All genotypes are assumed to be equally viable.\n2.  **Partial Embryonic Lethality:** The heterozygous genotype $Dd$ has a fractional survival viability of $S$ (where $0 < S < 1$), meaning a fraction $(1-S)$ of $Dd$ embryos do not survive to hatching. The $dd$ genotype is assumed to have a viability of 1.\n\nTo distinguish between these hypotheses, the geneticist isolates a large, representative sample of the *plain, non-iridescent* progeny from the $Dd \\times dd$ backcross. Each of these plain beetles is then individually mated with a beetle from the true-breeding plain line ($dd$). It is observed that a fraction, $f$, of these matings produce at least some iridescent offspring. The remaining $(1-f)$ fraction of matings produce only plain offspring.\n\nThis result conclusively refutes the partial embryonic lethality hypothesis. Assuming the incomplete penetrance model is correct, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the penetrance $P$ of the `D` allele as a function of the observed fraction $f$.", "solution": "In the backcross $Dd \\times dd$, assuming equal gamete contributions and no viability differences, the zygotic genotype frequencies are $P(Dd)=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $P(dd)=\\frac{1}{2}$. Under incomplete penetrance with penetrance $P$ for the iridescent phenotype among $D$-carriers, the phenotype probabilities are:\n- For $Dd$: iridescent with probability $P$ and plain with probability $1-P$.\n- For $dd$: always plain.\n\nTherefore, the total probability that a backcross progeny is plain is\n$$\nP(\\text{plain})=\\frac{1}{2}(1-P)+\\frac{1}{2}=1-\\frac{P}{2}.\n$$\nBy Bayes’ rule, the fraction of plain progeny that are actually $Dd$ (i.e., non-penetrant $D$-carriers) is\n$$\nP(Dd \\mid \\text{plain})=\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(1-P)}{1-\\frac{P}{2}}=\\frac{1-P}{2-P}.\n$$\n\nThe testcross of each plain individual to $dd$ will produce at least some iridescent offspring if and only if the tested plain parent is genotypically $Dd$ (because $dd \\times dd$ yields only plain), and with large brood sizes the probability that a $Dd \\times dd$ mating yields zero iridescent progeny tends to zero for any $P>0$. Hence, the observed fraction $f$ of plain parents that yield at least some iridescent offspring equals the fraction of plain parents that are $Dd$:\n$$\nf=P(Dd \\mid \\text{plain})=\\frac{1-P}{2-P}.\n$$\nSolving for $P$ gives\n$$\nf(2-P)=1-P \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad 2f-fP=1-P \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad P(1-f)=1-2f,\n$$\nand thus\n$$\nP=\\frac{1-2f}{1-f}.\n$$\n\nThis also explains why the observation refutes partial embryonic lethality: under the lethality model with full penetrance of $Dd$ for iridescence, every plain backcross progeny must be $dd$, so no testcross would ever produce iridescent offspring, implying $f=0$, contrary to the observation of positive $f$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1-2f}{1-f}}$$", "id": "1508253"}]}
