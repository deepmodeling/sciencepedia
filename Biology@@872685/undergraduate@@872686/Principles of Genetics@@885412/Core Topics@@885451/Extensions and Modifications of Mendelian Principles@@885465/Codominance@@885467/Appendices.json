This first exercise explores the fundamental outcome of codominance in a straightforward monohybrid cross. By tracking the inheritance of leaf patterns in a hypothetical plant, you will see how the $\\text{F}_2$ generation's phenotypic ratio provides a clear window into the underlying genotypic ratio, a hallmark of codominance that distinguishes it from complete dominance [@problem_id:1477625].", "problem": "In the study of a fictional ornamental plant, *Pictoria variegata*, the gene for leaf pattern has two codominant alleles. One allele, denoted as $L^S$, results in a striped leaf pattern. The other allele, $L^P$, results in a spotted leaf pattern. Due to codominance, heterozygous plants ($L^S L^P$) exhibit leaves that are simultaneously striped and spotted.\n\nAn evolutionary biologist begins an experiment by crossing a pure-breeding plant with striped leaves with a pure-breeding plant with spotted leaves. The resulting offspring are then allowed to self-pollinate to produce a second generation.\n\nAssuming Mendelian inheritance, what is the expected phenotypic ratio in this second generation? Express your answer as three numbers in a row matrix representing the ratio in the order of (Striped : Spotted : Striped-and-Spotted).", "solution": "Let the two codominant alleles be $L^{S}$ (striped) and $L^{P}$ (spotted). Under codominance, the heterozygote $L^{S}L^{P}$ expresses both patterns simultaneously.\n\nParental generation: a pure-breeding striped plant has genotype $L^{S}L^{S}$ and a pure-breeding spotted plant has genotype $L^{P}L^{P}$. Crossing these yields:\n$$L^{S}L^{S} \\times L^{P}L^{P} \\Rightarrow \\text{F}_1: \\text{all } L^{S}L^{P}$$\nby Mendel’s law of segregation, since each parent contributes one allele to the offspring.\n\nThe $\\text{F}_1$ plants are all $L^{S}L^{P}$ and self-pollinate. Each $L^{S}L^{P}$ individual produces gametes $L^{S}$ and $L^{P}$ with probabilities $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{2}$, respectively, by the law of segregation.

The allele $A^1$ codes for a deep indigo pigment, while the allele $A^2$ codes for a bright silver pigment. These alleles are codominant, meaning a plant with the genotype $A^1A^2$ will have petals with distinct patches of both indigo and silver.\n\nThe second gene controls the plant's height. The allele for tall stems, $B$, is completely dominant over the allele for dwarf stems, $b$.\n\nConsider a dihybrid cross between two Stardust Orchid plants, both having the genotype $A^1A^2Bb$.
