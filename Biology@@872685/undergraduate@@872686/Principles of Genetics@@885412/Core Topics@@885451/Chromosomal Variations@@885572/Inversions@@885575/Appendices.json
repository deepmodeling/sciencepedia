{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "This first practice problem establishes the fundamental consequence of a single crossover within a paracentric inversion loop: reduced fertility. By calculating the expected frequency of viable gametes from a given crossover rate, you will directly quantify the genetic cost of this meiotic event and understand why inversions effectively suppress the recovery of recombinant offspring. This exercise provides a quantitative foundation for understanding the impact of inversions [@problem_id:1499887].", "problem": "A geneticist is studying a laboratory population of the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster*. A particular fly is found to be heterozygous for a paracentric inversion on one of its autosomes. This means that for one homologous pair of chromosomes, one chromosome has the standard gene order, while the other contains a segment that is flipped in orientation. Cytological analysis reveals that in the germline cells of this fly, a single chiasma (the physical manifestation of a crossover) is formed within the bounds of this inverted region in exactly 30% of all meiotic divisions. For the remaining 70% of meiotic divisions, no crossover occurs within the inverted region. Assuming that any gamete with a chromosomal aberration (such as a deletion or duplication) resulting from the crossover is non-viable, calculate the expected frequency of viable gametes produced by this heterozygous fly. Express your answer as a decimal value.", "solution": "To determine the total frequency of viable gametes, we must consider the outcomes of two distinct classes of meiotic events: those without a crossover in the inverted region and those with a single crossover in the inverted region. We are given the frequencies of these events.\n\nLet's denote the total number of meioses as $N$.\nThe number of meioses with no crossover in the inverted region is $0.70 N$.\nThe number of meioses with a single crossover in the inverted region is $0.30 N$.\n\nCase 1: Meiosis with no crossover within the inversion (70% of meioses).\nIn a paracentric inversion heterozygote, the homologous chromosomes form an inversion loop to allow for synapsis. If no crossover occurs within this loop, the homologous chromosomes segregate normally during Anaphase I. The subsequent Meiosis II also proceeds normally. This process results in four gametes from each meiotic event.\n- Two gametes will contain the chromosome with the normal gene order. These are balanced and viable.\n- Two gametes will contain the chromosome with the inverted gene order. These are also genetically balanced and are considered viable.\nTherefore, for every meiotic event in this category, all 4 out of 4 products are viable.\nThe proportion of viable gametes from this group is $1.0$ (or 100%).\nThe contribution to the total pool of viable gametes from this class of meioses is the frequency of these meioses multiplied by the proportion of viable gametes they produce: $0.70 \\times 1.0 = 0.70$.\n\nCase 2: Meiosis with a single crossover within the inversion (30% of meioses).\nWhen a single crossover occurs within the inversion loop of a paracentric inversion heterozygote, the meiotic products are different. The crossover involves two of the four chromatids. The resulting four chromatids at the end of Meiosis I are:\n- One chromatid that was not involved in the crossover and has the normal gene order. This will produce one viable gamete.\n- One chromatid that was not involved in the crossover and has the inverted gene order. This will also produce one viable gamete.\n- One chromatid that is dicentric (has two centromeres). During Anaphase I, this chromatid is pulled towards opposite poles, forming a dicentric bridge. This bridge will eventually break at a random point. The resulting gamete will be unbalanced, carrying deletions and duplications, and is therefore non-viable.\n- One acentric fragment (lacks a centromere). This fragment cannot attach to the spindle fibers and is lost during cell division. The gamete that should have received it will be missing a large block of genes and is therefore non-viable.\nSo, for every meiotic event in this category, only 2 out of the 4 products are viable.\nThe proportion of viable gametes from this group is $2/4 = 0.5$ (or 50%).\nThe contribution to the total pool of viable gametes from this class of meioses is the frequency of these meioses multiplied by the proportion of viable gametes they produce: $0.30 \\times 0.5 = 0.15$.\n\nTotal Frequency of Viable Gametes:\nTo find the total expected frequency of viable gametes, we sum the contributions from both cases.\nTotal Frequency = (Contribution from Case 1) + (Contribution from Case 2)\nTotal Frequency = $0.70 + 0.15 = 0.85$.\n\nThus, the expected frequency of viable gametes is 0.85.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.85}$$", "id": "1499887"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand why inversions affect fertility, it is essential to know when they do not. This problem provides a critical contrast by positioning the crossover event completely outside the inverted region, where homologous chromosomes can pair linearly. Analyzing this scenario will clarify that the formation of non-viable gametes is not an inevitable outcome for an inversion heterozygote, but is specifically dependent on the location of the crossover relative to the inversion loop [@problem_id:1499914].", "problem": "Consider a hypothetical diploid organism where a particular chromosome has the normal gene order `cen-A-B-C-D-E-F`, where `cen` represents the centromere and the letters represent distinct gene loci. A population of this organism contains individuals with a paracentric inversion that encompasses the gene segment `B-C-D-E`. An individual that is heterozygous for this inversion, possessing one normal and one inverted chromosome, undergoes meiosis.\n\nDuring prophase I of meiosis in a single germ-line cell, the homologous chromosomes form the characteristic inversion loop to facilitate pairing. A single crossover event occurs in the chromosomal region between the centromere and the `A` locus.\n\nAssuming that gametes are viable only if they contain a full haploid set of genes (`A` through `F`) and are monocentric (possess exactly one centromere), what percentage of the four gametes resulting from this specific meiotic event will be viable?\n\nA. 0%\nB. 25%\nC. 50%\nD. 75%\nE. 100%", "solution": "The normal homolog has gene order cen-A-B-C-D-E-F. The paracentric inversion on the homologous chromosome inverts only the segment B through E, so the inverted homolog has order cen-A-E-D-C-B-F. In a heterozygote, homologous pairing in prophase I forms an inversion loop only across the inverted region B through E; regions outside that interval pair linearly.\n\nKey cytogenetic principle: In paracentric inversion heterozygotes, a single crossover within the inverted segment produces an acentric fragment and a dicentric bridge, leading to unbalanced, nonviable products. By contrast, a crossover outside the inverted interval occurs in a collinear region and produces balanced, monocentric recombinants.\n\nHere, the single crossover occurs between the centromere and locus A, which is outside the inverted segment. Let the crossover involve one chromatid from each homolog. Denote the segments:\n- For the normal chromatid: proximal segment $P_{N}$ (from the centromere to the crossover point) and distal segment $D_{N} = \\text{A-B-C-D-E-F}$.\n- For the inverted chromatid: proximal segment $P_{I}$ and distal segment $D_{I} = \\text{A-E-D-C-B-F}$.\n\nA single crossover exchanges distal segments, giving recombinants\n$$\nR_{1} = P_{N} + D_{I} = \\text{(centromere)} + \\text{A-E-D-C-B-F},\n$$\n$$\nR_{2} = P_{I} + D_{N} = \\text{(centromere)} + \\text{A-B-C-D-E-F}.\n$$\nEach recombinant carries exactly one centromere (it resides in the proximal segment) and a complete set of loci A through F. The two nonrecombinant sister chromatids (one normal, one inverted) are also balanced and monocentric.\n\nTherefore, all four resulting chromatids yield gametes that are both monocentric and contain the full haploid gene set. Hence, the fraction of viable gametes from this meiotic event is $4/4$, i.e., all.\n\nThe correct choice is E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1499914"}, {"introduction": "Now, let's apply these principles to a scenario mirroring the work of a geneticist. The apparent suppression of recombination within an inverted segment is not just a meiotic curiosity; it is a powerful signal that can be used to map chromosomal rearrangements. In this exercise, you will analyze recombination frequency data from a test cross to deduce the breakpoints of an unknown inversion, demonstrating how meiotic behavior can be used as an investigative tool [@problem_id:1499910].", "problem": "A geneticist is studying a wild population of *Drosophila melanogaster* and has identified a strain that is homozygous for a large chromosomal inversion on chromosome 2. To map the approximate location of this inversion, a series of experiments are conducted.\n\nFirst, a standard genetic map of a segment of chromosome 2 is provided, based on studies with lab strains that do not have the inversion. This map uses several recessive marker genes: `net` (net veins), `pr` (purple eyes), `b` (black body), `c` (curved wings), `px` (plexus wings), and `sp` (speck body).\n\nThe standard map order and distances are:\n`net` --- 10 cM --- `pr` --- 8 cM --- `b` --- 17 cM --- `c` --- 5 cM --- `px` --- 9 cM --- `sp`\n\nAn F1 fly is produced by crossing the homozygous inversion strain (which is homozygous for the wild-type dominant alleles for all markers) with a homozygous lab strain that has a standard chromosome arrangement and is homozygous for all six recessive marker alleles.\n\nThis F1 fly, which is heterozygous for the inversion and for all marker genes, is then test-crossed with a fly from the homozygous recessive lab strain. The phenotypes of 10,000 progeny from this test cross are scored, and the recombination frequencies (RF) between adjacent genes are calculated as follows:\n\n- RF between `net` and `pr`: 10.2%\n- RF between `pr` and `b`: 0.15%\n- RF between `b` and `c`: 0.21%\n- RF between `c` and `px`: 0.09%\n- RF between `px` and `sp`: 9.3%\n\nBased on these data, which of the following statements most accurately describes the location of the inversion's breakpoints?\n\nA. The inversion is small and located entirely within the interval between genes `b` and `c`.\nB. The inversion contains only gene `b`, with breakpoints in the intervals `pr-b` and `b-c`.\nC. The inversion contains genes `b` and `c`, with breakpoints located in the interval `pr-b` and the interval `c-px`.\nD. The inversion spans the entire region from `pr` to `px`, with breakpoints in the intervals `net-pr` and `px-sp`.\nE. The data are inconclusive because it is not specified whether the inversion is paracentric or pericentric.", "solution": "The standard marker order and map distances are net — pr — b — c — px — sp with adjacent distances of 10, 8, 17, 5, and 9 map units, respectively. In a test cross without structural heterozygosity, the recombination frequency (RF) between adjacent markers approximates the map distance. In an inversion heterozygote, however, crossovers within the inverted segment (and in intervals that straddle the inversion breakpoints) are rarely recovered because they generate unbalanced chromatids (paracentric inversions) or duplication/deletion products (pericentric inversions). Consequently, RF is strongly suppressed for intervals inside the inversion or overlapping a breakpoint, whereas intervals entirely outside the inversion retain near-standard RF.\n\nCompare the observed adjacent RFs with the standard map:\n- net–pr: observed RF is $0.102$, which matches the standard $0.10$; therefore net–pr is entirely outside the inversion and does not straddle a breakpoint.\n- px–sp: observed RF is $0.093$, which matches the standard $0.09$; therefore px–sp is entirely outside the inversion and does not straddle a breakpoint.\n- pr–b: observed RF is $0.0015$ versus standard $0.08$; this drastic suppression shows that this interval lies within or overlaps the inversion.\n- b–c: observed RF is $0.0021$ versus standard $0.17$; this is also strongly suppressed, indicating inclusion within the inversion.\n- c–px: observed RF is $0.0009$ versus standard $0.05$; this is likewise suppressed, indicating inclusion within or overlap with the inversion.\n\nFrom these comparisons, the intervals pr–b, b–c, and c–px are all suppressed, while net–pr and px–sp remain normal. Therefore, the inverted segment must include b and c and extend at least from within the pr–b interval through b–c and into the c–px interval. Because net–pr shows normal RF, a breakpoint cannot lie in net–pr; because px–sp shows normal RF, a breakpoint cannot lie in px–sp. The only configuration consistent with all observations is that the breakpoints are located within the pr–b interval and within the c–px interval, placing genes b and c inside the inversion, with net–pr and px–sp outside and unaffected.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because suppression is not confined to b–c; pr–b and c–px are also suppressed.\n- B is incorrect because suppression extends beyond pr–b and b–c to c–px, so the inversion contains more than just b.\n- C is correct: the inversion contains b and c, with breakpoints in pr–b and c–px, yielding suppressed RFs for pr–b, b–c, and c–px, and normal RFs for net–pr and px–sp.\n- D is incorrect because placing breakpoints in net–pr and px–sp would suppress those intervals, contrary to the observed near-standard RFs there.\n- E is incorrect because the pattern of suppression suffices to localize the breakpoints relative to the markers regardless of whether the inversion is paracentric or pericentric.\n\nThus, the data most accurately support that the inversion contains genes b and c, with breakpoints in the pr–b and c–px intervals.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1499910"}]}
