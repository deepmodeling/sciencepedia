{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding a genetic condition like Turner syndrome begins with the fundamental cellular processes that can go awry. This first practice focuses on meiotic nondisjunction, the most common cause of aneuploidy. By tracing the journey of sex chromosomes through a faulty meiotic division, you will determine the potential genetic makeup of gametes, a foundational skill for grasping how conditions like monosomy X arise [@problem_id:1533595].", "problem": "In human genetics, aneuploidy, an abnormal number of chromosomes, often results from an error during meiosis called nondisjunction. Consider a healthy human female with a normal XX sex chromosome constitution. If nondisjunction of the homologous sex chromosomes occurs during Meiosis I of oogenesis, what is the resulting set of sex chromosome constitutions for the four cells produced at the completion of meiosis?

X, X, O, O", "solution": "Principle: In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes segregate to opposite poles; nondisjunction in meiosis I means both homologs travel to the same pole. In meiosis II, sister chromatids of each chromosome separate.\n\nStart: A normal human female germ cell has an XX pair of sex chromosomes.\n\nEvent: Nondisjunction of the homologous X chromosomes occurs during Meiosis I. Therefore, after Meiosis I:\n- One secondary oocyte receives both X homologs (disomic for X; genotype XX).\n- The other cell (the first polar body) receives no X chromosome (nullisomic for X; genotype O).\n\nProceed to Meiosis II:\n- The disomic (XX) secondary oocyte undergoes Meiosis II. In this division, the sister chromatids of the two X chromosomes separate, resulting in two products that are also disomic (genotype XX).\n- The nullisomic (O) cell also divides in Meiosis II, producing two products that remain nullisomic (genotype O).\n\nCollecting the four products at the completion of meiosis gives the set of genotypes: XX, XX, O, O, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1533595"}, {"introduction": "Once a chromosomal abnormality is identified, a key question in genetic counseling is determining its origin. This exercise puts you in the role of a genetic detective, using a family's pedigree and the inheritance pattern of an X-linked trait to pinpoint the parental origin of the nondisjunction event leading to Turner syndrome. This practice demonstrates how classical Mendelian principles are applied in a modern clinical context to unravel the history of a genetic condition [@problem_id:1533575].", "problem": "In a clinical genetics consultation, a family's genetic makeup is analyzed to understand the origin of their daughter's condition. The daughter has been diagnosed with Turner syndrome, a condition characterized by the presence of a single X chromosome and the absence of a second sex chromosome (genotype XO).\n\nFor a particular X-linked gene related to red-green color vision, there are two alleles: a dominant allele for normal color vision, denoted $X^{CV}$, and a recessive allele for color blindness, denoted $X^{cv}$.\n\nGenetic testing and phenotype analysis reveal the following:\n- The father has normal color vision.\n- The mother is colorblind.\n- The daughter, who has Turner syndrome, is also colorblind.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements correctly identifies the origin of the chromosomal error?\n\nA. The nondisjunction event occurred in the mother.\n\nB. The nondisjunction event occurred in the father.\n\nC. The nondisjunction could have occurred in either parent; the provided information is insufficient to distinguish.\n\nD. A mitotic error occurred in the zygote after fertilization, not a meiotic error in a parent.\n\nE. The nondisjunction occurred in both parents simultaneously.", "solution": "We use principles of X-linked inheritance and meiotic nondisjunction.\n\nLet the X-linked alleles be $X^{CV}$ (dominant, normal vision) and $X^{cv}$ (recessive, colorblind). Because the father is a phenotypically normal male, his genotype must be $X^{CV}Y$. Because the mother is a colorblind female, she must be homozygous recessive, $X^{cv}X^{cv}$.\n\nThe daughter has Turner syndrome, so her karyotype is $XO$. She is colorblind, so the single X she carries must be $X^{cv}$. Therefore, the daughter’s genotype is $X^{cv}O$. This immediately implies that the X chromosome present in the daughter is maternal (since the father’s only X is $X^{CV}$, which would confer normal vision if present).\n\nHence, the missing sex chromosome must have been the paternal contribution. We analyze which parental nondisjunction can produce an $XO$ zygote with the observed phenotype:\n\n1) Maternal nondisjunction: A nondisjunction in the mother can produce eggs that are $XX$ or $O$. For an $XO$ daughter to result from maternal nondisjunction, the $O$ egg must be fertilized by a paternal $X$ sperm, yielding $X^{CV}O$. This would produce a Turner daughter with normal color vision, contradicting the observation of color blindness. Therefore, maternal nondisjunction cannot explain the observed $X^{cv}O$ colorblind Turner daughter given a normal-vision father.\n\n2) Paternal nondisjunction: A nondisjunction in the father can produce sperm that are $XY$ or $O$. Fertilization of a normal maternal $X^{cv}$ egg by an $O$ sperm yields $X^{cv}O$, precisely matching the daughter’s Turner karyotype and colorblind phenotype. Thus, the data are consistent with paternal nondisjunction producing a nullisomic ($O$) sperm.\n\n3) Post-zygotic mitotic error: A mitotic error after fertilization starting from a zygote with two sex chromosomes typically produces mosaicism (e.g., $XO/XX$), not a uniform $XO$ line in all cells; furthermore, starting from $X^{CV}X^{cv}$, loss of the paternal $X^{CV}$ in all cells to produce uniform $X^{cv}O$ is not the expected outcome and is not required to explain the data. The straightforward and sufficient explanation is paternal meiotic nondisjunction.\n\nTherefore, the nondisjunction event occurred in the father.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1533575"}, {"introduction": "The clinical spectrum of Turner syndrome is linked to a variety of underlying genetic changes, not just the classic 45,X karyotype. This problem delves into a common structural variant, the isochromosome, to explore the concept of gene dosage in more detail. By calculating the number of gene copies from the short ($p$) and long ($q$) arms of the X chromosome, you will see how partial monosomy and partial trisomy can coexist and contribute to the phenotype, illustrating a crucial principle in genotype-phenotype correlation [@problem_id:1533609].", "problem": "In human genetics, the short arm of a chromosome is designated as the 'p' arm (from the French *petit*), and the long arm is the 'q' arm. A chromosomally normal female has a 46,XX karyotype, possessing two copies of both the p and q arms of the X chromosome. Classic Turner syndrome results from a 45,X karyotype, where an individual has only one X chromosome.\n\nA significant variant of Turner syndrome involves the formation of an isochromosome. An isochromosome is an abnormal chromosome with two identical arms (either two short arms or two long arms) due to a transverse, rather than longitudinal, division of the centromere during cell division.\n\nConsider an individual with a karyotype of 46,X,i(Xq).
