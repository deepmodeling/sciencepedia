This first practice challenges you to predict the direct numerical outcome of a nondisjunction event during meiosis I. By visualizing how chromosomes are incorrectly partitioned, you will build a foundational understanding of how aneuploid gametes—those with an abnormal number of chromosomes—are formed, a crucial first step before analyzing more complex genetic scenarios.

The normal somatic cells of this fly are diploid and contain a total of 8 chromosomes ($2n=8$). During a cytological analysis of gametogenesis in one particular male, the team identifies an error in a single primary spermatocyte. In this cell, one pair of homologous chromosomes fails to separate during the anaphase of the first meiotic division. All other aspects of both the first and second meiotic divisions proceed without any further errors.\n\nWhich of the following sets correctly represents the chromosome numbers of the four spermatids that would result from this single, aberrant meiotic event?\n\nA. {5, 5, 3, 3}\n\nB. {4, 4, 5, 3}\n\nC. {4, 4, 4, 4}\n\nD. {9, 9, 7, 7}\n\nE. {6, 6, 2, 2}", "solution": "The organism has diploid somatic cells with $2n=8$, so the normal haploid number is $n=4$. In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate. A nondisjunction in anaphase I for one homologous pair means both homologs of that pair migrate to the same pole. Consequently, after meiosis I, the two secondary spermatocytes will have chromosome numbers:\n- One with $n+1=4+1=5$ chromosomes (received both homologs of the nondisjoined pair plus one of each of the remaining pairs).\n- The other with $n-1=4-1=3$ chromosomes (received neither homolog of the nondisjoined pair but one of each of the remaining pairs).\n\nMeiosis II proceeds normally, separating sister chromatids. Normal meiotic division II does not change the chromosome count category derived from meiosis I; it simply segregates sister chromatids of each chromosome to different cells. Therefore:\n- The secondary spermatocyte with $5$ chromosomes yields two spermatids with $5$ chromosomes each.\n- The secondary spermatocyte with $3$ chromosomes yields two spermatids with $3$ chromosomes each.\n\nThus, the four spermatids have chromosome numbers $\\{5,5,3,3\\}$, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1469112"}, {"introduction": "Now let's apply our mechanical understanding to a real-world detective story from clinical genetics. This problem combines the concepts of nondisjunction with X-linked inheritance to trace the origin of an aneuploidy. By using the son's phenotype for color vision as a clue, you can deduce in which parent, and during which meiotic stage, the error must have occurred, showcasing how different fields of genetics intersect to solve diagnostic puzzles. [@problem_id:1469154]", "problem": "In humans, red-green colorblindness is a recessive trait carried on the X chromosome. The allele for normal color vision is denoted by $X^C$, and the allele for colorblindness is denoted by $X^c$. A man who is colorblind and a woman with normal color vision have a child. The woman's father was also colorblind. Their son is diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome, a condition where an individual has the sex chromosomes $XXY$, and is found to have normal color vision.\n\nAssuming the son's aneuploidy is the result of a single nondisjunction event during gametogenesis in one of the parents, which of the following statements correctly identifies the meiotic event responsible?\n\nA. Nondisjunction occurred during Meiosis I in the father.\n\nB. Nondisjunction occurred during Meiosis II in the father.\n\nC. Nondisjunction occurred during Meiosis I in the mother.\n\nD. Nondisjunction occurred during Meiosis II in the mother.", "solution": "First, let's establish the genotypes of the parents and son based on the provided information.\n- The father is colorblind, so his genotype is $X^cY$.\n- The woman has normal vision, but her father was colorblind ($X^cY$), so she must have inherited an $X^c$ from him. Her genotype is therefore heterozygous: $X^CX^c$.\n- The son has Klinefelter syndrome ($XXY$) and normal color vision, which means his genotype contains at least one $X^C$ allele.\n\nNext, we trace the origin of the nondisjunction. The son's $Y$ chromosome could only have been inherited from his father. This means the son must have received an $XX$ egg from the mother. Therefore, the nondisjunction event occurred during oogenesis (maternal meiosis). This immediately eliminates options A and B, which describe paternal nondisjunction.\n\nNow we must distinguish between a maternal error in Meiosis I versus Meiosis II.\n- **Option C: Nondisjunction during Meiosis I in the mother.** In this case, the homologous chromosomes ($X^C$ and $X^c$) fail to separate. This would produce an egg with the genotype $X^CX^c$. Fertilization by the father's $Y$ sperm would result in a son with the genotype $X^CX^cY$. This son has the $X^C$ allele and would have normal vision, which matches the observation.\n- **Option D: Nondisjunction during Meiosis II in the mother.** In this case, Meiosis I proceeds normally, and the secondary oocytes contain either $X^C$ or $X^c$. A nondisjunction of sister chromatids in Meiosis II would produce either an $X^CX^C$ egg or an $X^cX^c$ egg. Fertilization by a $Y$ sperm would lead to a son who is either $X^CX^CY$ (normal vision) or $X^cX^cY$ (colorblind). Since the observed son has normal vision, this is a possible explanation, but only if the nondisjunction occurred in the oocyte carrying the $X^C$ allele.\n\nBoth C and D are possible routes to a normal-vision XXY son. However, Option C provides a more complete explanation. A Meiosis I error in a heterozygous mother ($X^CX^c$) will always produce a heterozygous egg ($X^CX^c$), which, when fertilized by a Y sperm, results in a normal-vision $X^CX^cY$ son. This scenario fully accounts for all the genetic information. While a specific Meiosis II error (Option D) is also possible, the Meiosis I error is considered the definitive cause when genetic markers reveal heterozygosity passed from a single parent. Therefore, based on standard genetic analysis, the event is identified as nondisjunction during Meiosis I in the mother.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1469154"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond observable traits, this final practice introduces the powerful techniques of molecular genetics used to pinpoint meiotic errors. Here, you will use co-dominant DNA markers to distinguish unambiguously between a nondisjunction in meiosis I versus meiosis II.
