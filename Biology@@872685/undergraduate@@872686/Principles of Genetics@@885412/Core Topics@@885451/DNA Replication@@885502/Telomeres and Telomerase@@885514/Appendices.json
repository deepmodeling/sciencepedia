This exercise challenges you to apply the principles of reverse transcription to predict the DNA sequence synthesized by telomerase, using its internal RNA component as a guide. Mastering this core mechanism is the first step to understanding how cells preserve the integrity of their chromosomes during division [@problem_id:1524872].", "problem": "In the field of molecular biology, the maintenance of chromosome ends in eukaryotes is a critical process managed by an enzyme called telomerase. Telomerase acts as a reverse transcriptase, synthesizing DNA repeats to extend the 3' overhang of a linear chromosome, thereby compensating for the end-replication problem. To perform this function, telomerase carries its own internal RNA molecule which it uses as a template.\n\nA researcher is studying a newly discovered species of extremophilic yeast. They isolate the telomerase enzyme and determine that its internal RNA template has the sequence 3'-CCUAAAC-5'. Based on the known mechanism of telomerase, what is the sequence of the single-stranded DNA that would be synthesized using this template?

DNA synthesis proceeds in the $5' \\to 3'$ direction while reading the RNA template in the antiparallel $3' \\to 5'$ direction. Base-pairing in a DNA–RNA hybrid follows standard complementarity: RNA $A$ pairs with DNA $T$, RNA $U$ pairs with DNA $A$, RNA $C$ pairs with DNA $G$, and RNA $G$ pairs with DNA $C$.\n\nThe given RNA template is $3'$-CCUAAAC-$5'$.

This thought experiment explores the distinct roles of these two components by imagining a hypothetical hybrid enzyme made from different species [@problem_id:1524869]. By predicting the outcome, you can solidify your understanding of how the RNA component acts as the specific blueprint for telomere synthesis, a key principle of telomerase function.", "problem": "Telomerase is a specialized ribonucleoprotein enzyme responsible for maintaining the length of chromosome ends, known as telomeres. It functions as a reverse transcriptase, consisting of two primary components: a catalytic protein subunit called Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT), and an RNA component known as the Telomerase RNA Component (TERC), which provides the template for synthesizing telomeric DNA repeats.\n\nIn humans, the G-rich telomere strand consists of tandem repeats of the sequence 5'-TTAGGG-3'. The template region within the human TERC (hTERC) that directs this synthesis is 3'-CAAUCCCAAUC-5'. In contrast, the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* has telomere repeats that are more irregular, but the synthesis is directed by a template region within yeast TERC (yTERC) of 3'-CACACCCACAC-5'.\n\nA molecular biologist conducts an *in vitro* experiment to probe the modularity of the telomerase enzyme. They successfully purify the human TERT protein (hTERT) and the yeast TERC RNA (yTERC). They then reconstitute a chimeric telomerase enzyme by combining hTERT and yTERC in a reaction tube. This chimeric enzyme is supplied with a short, single-stranded DNA primer (5'-AGAGAGAGAGAG-3'), an abundance of all four deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP), and a buffer that supports enzymatic activity. While protein-RNA interactions across highly divergent species can be non-functional, the core catalytic and template-binding domains of TERT and TERC are known to be structurally conserved across eukaryotes, suggesting a functional assembly is plausible.\n\nWhich of the following options describes the most likely outcome of this experiment?\n\nA. The primer is extended by the addition of the canonical human telomeric sequence, 5'-GGTTAGGGTTA-3'.\n\nB. The primer is extended by the addition of a sequence templated by the yeast TERC, 5'-GTGTGGGTGTG-3'.\n\nC. The primer is extended by the addition of a DNA sequence identical to the yeast TERC template region, 5'-CACACCCACAC-3'.\n\nD. The primer is rapidly degraded by an intrinsic 3' to 5' exonuclease activity of the human TERT protein.\n\nE. No reaction occurs, as the human TERT protein cannot form a functional complex with the yeast TERC RNA.", "solution": "Telomerase is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (a reverse transcriptase). The catalytic TERT subunit extends the 3' end of a DNA primer by copying the sequence specified by the internal RNA template within TERC. By the rules of reverse transcription, the DNA product is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction and is the Watson-Crick complement of the RNA template (RNA C pairs with DNA G, RNA A pairs with DNA T, and RNA U pairs with DNA A); the product is not identical to the RNA template sequence.\n\nIn the chimeric complex described, the only available template is the yeast TERC (yTERC) with a template region 3'-CACACCCACAC-5'. Therefore, if the human TERT (hTERT) and yeast TERC assemble into a functional ribonucleoprotein (made plausible by the stated conservation of core domains), the extension added to the DNA primer will be the complement of this RNA template, written 5' to 3'. Applying the base-pairing rules position by position to 3'-CACACCCACAC-5' yields the DNA sequence 5'-GTGTGGGTGTG-3'.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A would require the human TERC template; it is not present, so the canonical human repeat is not expected.\n- Option B matches the DNA complement of the yeast template region and is exactly what a functional chimeric telomerase would synthesize.\n- Option C incorrectly proposes a DNA sequence identical to the RNA template; telomerase synthesizes the complement, not a direct copy.\n- Option D is incorrect because TERT does not possess an intrinsic 3' to 5' exonuclease activity that would rapidly degrade the primer.\n- Option E is disfavored by the problem’s note that the conserved core domains make a functional assembly plausible; thus the most likely outcome is templated extension from yTERC.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the sequence templated by yTERC, 5'-GTGTGGGTGTG-3'.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1524869"}, {"introduction": "The length of our telomeres can be modeled as a biological clock, counting down with each cell division.

The cells are known to enter a state of replicative senescence when their average telomere length reaches a critical threshold. Initially, the average telomere length in the culture is $L_0 = 11.0$ kilobases (kb). The critical senescent length for these cells is $L_{crit} = 5.0$ kb. Due to the end-replication problem, these fibroblasts lose $R_{loss} = 65$ base pairs (bp) from their telomeres with each cell division.\n\nThe researcher divides the primary culture into two identical sub-cultures: Culture A (Control) and Culture B (Treated). Culture A is allowed to divide normally. Culture B is treated with an experimental compound that partially activates the Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT) enzyme. This activation is imperfect and only restores $R_{add} = 20$ bp to the telomeres per cell division.\n\nAssuming the rates of loss and addition remain constant, calculate how many more generations the cells in Culture B can undergo compared to the cells in Culture A before they reach the critical senescent length.
