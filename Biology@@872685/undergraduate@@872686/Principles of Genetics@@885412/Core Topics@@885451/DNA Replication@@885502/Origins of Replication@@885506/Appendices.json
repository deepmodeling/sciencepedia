This exercise challenges you to predict the fate of a bacterial population whose chromosomal origin, *oriC*, has been precisely removed. This scenario forces a deep consideration of the fundamental coupling between DNA replication and cell division, clarifying why the *oriC* is non-negotiable for the propagation of a bacterial lineage [@problem_id:1507434].", "problem": "A geneticist is studying the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, a prokaryote with a single, circular chromosome. The researcher uses a precision gene-editing tool to perfectly delete the *oriC* sequence from the chromosome of every bacterium in a starting population. The *oriC* (origin of chromosomal replication) is the specific DNA locus where the initiation of chromosome replication normally begins. The modified bacteria are then transferred to a flask containing a nutrient-rich liquid medium and incubated under conditions that are optimal for growth.\n\nWhich of the following statements describes the most direct and immediate consequence for this population of bacteria?\n\nA. The bacteria will immediately die, as the deletion of *oriC* disrupts essential metabolic pathways required for cellular respiration and nutrient synthesis.\nB. The bacteria will attempt to replicate their DNA by initiating the process at random locations on the chromosome, leading to the formation of fragmented, non-functional genomes.\nC. The existing bacteria will remain metabolically active but will be unable to initiate chromosome replication, and therefore cannot undergo cell division, leading to a halt in population growth.\nD. The existing bacteria will continue to grow in size and will proceed with cell division without replicating their DNA, resulting in the production of anucleated (genomeless) daughter cells.", "solution": "Escherichia coli has a single, circular chromosome with a unique, cis-acting origin of replication, oriC. Initiation of chromosomal replication in E. coli is origin-dependent and requires the initiator protein DnaA in its ATP-bound form to bind specific DnaA boxes within oriC, melt the adjacent DNA unwinding element, and recruit the replicative helicase (DnaB) via DnaC, followed by primase (DnaG) and DNA polymerase assembly to form two replisomes that proceed bidirectionally. Thus, chromosomal replication initiation is strictly oriC-dependent.\n\nDeleting oriC removes the only native site at which the replication initiation machinery can assemble. Without oriC, DnaA cannot nucleate origin melting, DnaB cannot be loaded, and no replication forks can form. Therefore, initiation of chromosomal replication cannot occur at all. In bacteria, there is no general mechanism to initiate chromosome replication at random loci; helicase loading and replisome assembly are origin-specific. Consequently, fragmented or randomly initiated replication (as in option B) does not occur.\n\nMetabolic activity per se does not directly depend on oriC. The deletion of oriC does not globally abrogate transcription or translation of metabolic genes already present and expressed; existing cells can remain metabolically active for some time in a rich medium. Therefore, immediate death due to disruption of respiration or biosynthesis (as in option A) is not the direct and immediate consequence of losing oriC.\n\nCell division in E. coli is coordinated with DNA replication and chromosome segregation. Assembly and constriction of the FtsZ ring are regulated by systems including nucleoid occlusion (e.g., SlmA bound to specific chromosomal sites) and the Min system, which together prevent septation over an unsegregated nucleoid. When replication does not initiate, the chromosome remains unreplicated and unsegregated, maintaining nucleoid occlusion that inhibits cytokinesis. While cells may increase in mass or length temporarily in nutrient-rich conditions, division is blocked in the absence of replication initiation. Systematic production of anucleate daughter cells without prior DNA replication (as in option D) is therefore not the expected immediate outcome; instead, division is halted.\n\nThus, the most direct and immediate consequence of deleting oriC from all bacteria in the population is that the existing bacteria remain metabolically active but cannot initiate chromosome replication, and therefore cannot undergo cell division, halting population growth.

This problem explores what happens when a plasmid is unable to replicate itself, demonstrating how genetic information is passively diluted and ultimately lost in a growing population.

This plasmid contains a gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic tetracycline but was accidentally constructed without a functional origin of replication (ori). The transformed bacterium is immediately transferred to a large flask of nutrient-rich liquid medium that contains no tetracycline. The culture is then incubated under ideal conditions, allowing the bacterial population to grow exponentially through binary fission.

What if a plasmid *lacking* an origin is nevertheless stably maintained in a bacterial population? This scenario challenges you to think like a molecular biologist, moving beyond simple rules to propose a plausible mechanism that explains this surprising result by integrating your knowledge of other fundamental genetic processes [@problem_id:2052792].", "problem": "A synthetic biology student is working with *Escherichia coli*. The goal is to have the bacteria stably express a kanamycin resistance gene, `kanR`. The student transforms a strain of *E. coli* with a specially designed circular plasmid named `pSYN-1`. This plasmid contains the `kanR` gene. However, due to a design error, the plasmid's origin of replication (ori), which is necessary for initiating its own DNA replication, is non-functional. The plasmid `pSYN-1` also happens to carry a 1,000 base pair DNA sequence that is identical to a segment of the *E. coli* chromosome's non-essential `lacZ` gene.\n\nThe student plates the transformed bacteria on a nutrient agar containing kanamycin. To the student's surprise, after incubation, several colonies are observed to be growing. When cells from these colonies are re-streaked onto fresh kanamycin plates, they continue to grow, indicating that the kanamycin resistance is a stable, heritable trait.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most plausible molecular mechanism for the stable inheritance of the `kanR` gene from the ori-deficient `pSYN-1` plasmid?\n\nA. The plasmid integrates into the host chromosome through homologous recombination between the `lacZ` sequence on the plasmid and the `lacZ` gene on the chromosome, and is subsequently replicated as part of the host genome.\nB. The plasmid is maintained as an episome (an extrachromosomal element) by utilizing the host cell's chromosome partitioning machinery, which ensures at least one copy of `pSYN-1` is segregated to each daughter cell during division.\nC. The host cell's DNA polymerase enzymes recognize the defective ori as damaged DNA and \"repair\" it into a functional sequence, allowing the plasmid to replicate independently.\nD. A host-encoded enzyme that initiates rolling-circle replication in bacteriophages randomly nicks the `pSYN-1` plasmid, initiating replication without the need for a specific origin.\nE. The KanR protein produced from the plasmid is exceptionally stable and is distributed between daughter cells upon division, conferring a \"pseudo-resistance\" that allows survival for several generations until a spontaneous mutation restores the ori.", "solution": "The core of the problem is to explain how a plasmid that cannot replicate on its own (`ori-deficient`) can still be stably maintained in a dividing bacterial population under selective pressure (kanamycin). Without a replication mechanism, any plasmid would be diluted by a factor of two at each cell division. After a few generations, most cells would have no plasmid and would be killed by the antibiotic. The fact that stable, growing colonies are formed implies that the genetic information for resistance (the `kanR` gene) is being replicated and passed on to daughter cells. Let's analyze each option.\n\n**Option A: Integration via Homologous Recombination**\nThis is the most plausible mechanism. Homologous recombination is a natural process in bacteria that allows for the exchange of genetic material between two similar DNA sequences. The problem states that the plasmid `pSYN-1` contains a sequence identical to a part of the host's `lacZ` gene. A single crossover event between the circular plasmid and the bacterial chromosome at these homologous `lacZ` regions would result in the linearization and insertion of the entire plasmid into the host chromosome. Once integrated, the plasmid DNA, including the `kanR` gene, becomes a permanent part of the host's genome. It will now be replicated along with the entire chromosome by the host's own replication machinery, which initiates at the chromosomal origin (`oriC`), not the defective plasmid ori. This ensures that every daughter cell inherits a copy of the `kanR` gene, explaining the stable resistance to kanamycin. This type of cell, with an integrated plasmid, is known as an Hfr (High-frequency recombination) cell.\n\n**Option B: Use of Partitioning Machinery**\nThis option is incorrect. Partitioning systems (like Par) are responsible for the active segregation of already replicated plasmids into daughter cells. Their function is to ensure that a low-copy-number plasmid isn't lost by chance by ending up in only one daughter cell. However, partitioning machinery does not replicate the DNA. If the plasmid is not replicating in the first place, there will soon be only one copy left in the entire cell lineage, which will be passed to only one daughter cell at division. The plasmid concentration in the population would still be diluted out. Therefore, partitioning alone cannot compensate for a lack of replication.\n\n**Option C: DNA Polymerase Repair**\nThis option is highly unlikely. DNA repair mechanisms, carried out by enzymes like DNA polymerase, are designed to fix small errors like base mismatches, insertions, deletions, or chemical damage (e.g., thymine dimers). They work by using the complementary strand as a template. \"Repairing\" a large, non-functional sequence like a defective origin into a complex, functional one would require a massive, non-templated synthesis of a specific sequence. This is not a known function of a cell's standard repair machinery.\n\n**Option D: Random Rolling-Circle Replication**\nWhile rolling-circle replication is a valid mechanism for some plasmids and viruses, it is initiated at a specific sequence, the double-strand origin (DSO). It is not initiated by random nicks created by a host enzyme. A random, unregulated replication process would be inefficient and unstable, and is not a recognized mechanism for maintaining a plasmid population-wide. It would not guarantee a copy for each daughter cell in a reliable manner.\n\n**Option E: Protein Stability and Distribution**\nThis option confuses the persistence of a protein with the inheritance of a gene. While a stable protein might persist for a few cell divisions, it would be diluted at each division just like a non-replicating plasmid. Eventually, its concentration would fall below the level needed to confer resistance. More importantly, this mechanism provides no way for the genetic blueprint (the `kanR` gene) to be replicated and passed on. Without inheritance of the gene, the ability to produce more KanR protein would be lost, and the resistance would not be a stable, heritable trait as observed in the experiment.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, the only mechanism that explains the stable replication and inheritance of the `kanR` gene from an ori-deficient plasmid is the integration of the plasmid into the host chromosome. Option A correctly describes this process.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2052792"}]}
