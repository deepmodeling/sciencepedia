Assuming that each cell division is preceded by one round of DNA replication, calculate the total number of individual polynucleotide DNA strands across the entire final population of cells that contain the $^{15}\\text{N}$ isotope.", "solution": "The problem requires us to track the fate of the original DNA strands through three generations of replication. The fundamental principle governing this process is the semiconservative model of DNA replication. This model states that a parent DNA double helix unwinds, and each of its two strands serves as a template for the synthesis of a new, complementary strand.\n\nLet's denote an original strand, labeled with $^{15}\\text{N}$, as $S_{15}$, and a newly synthesized strand, made with $^{14}\\text{N}$, as $S_{14}$.\n\n**Generation 0 (Initial State):**\nWe begin with one bacterial cell. Its single chromosome consists of a DNA double helix where both strands are composed entirely of $^{15}\\text{N}$.\n- Number of cells: $1$\n- DNA molecule composition: One molecule of ($S_{15}$/$S_{15}$).\n- Total number of $S_{15}$ strands in the population: $2$.\n- Total number of $S_{14}$ strands in the population: $0$.\n\n**Generation 1 (After the first round of replication):**\nThe initial cell divides into two cells. Before division, its DNA replicates. The ($S_{15}$/$S_{15}$) molecule unwinds into two separate $S_{15}$ strands. Each of these strands serves as a template for a new strand, synthesized using the $^{14}\\text{N}$ available in the medium.\n- The two template $S_{15}$ strands each get a new $S_{14}$ partner.\n- This results in two new DNA molecules, both of which are hybrids: ($S_{15}$/$S_{14}$).\n- These two molecules are segregated into the two daughter cells.\n- Population size: $2$ cells.\n- DNA composition: Each cell has one ($S_{15}$/$S_{14}$) molecule.\n- Total number of $S_{15}$ strands in the population: still $2$. These are the original two strands from Generation 0.\n- Total number of $S_{14}$ strands in the population: $2$.\n\n**Generation 2 (After the second round of replication):**\nThe two cells from Generation 1 divide, resulting in four cells. Each of the two hybrid ($S_{15}$/$S_{14}$) molecules replicates.\n- Each ($S_{15}$/$S_{14}$) molecule unwinds to provide one $S_{15}$ template and one $S_{14}$ template.\n- From the two cells, we have a total of two $S_{15}$ templates and two $S_{14}$ templates.\n- The two $S_{15}$ templates are used to synthesize two new $S_{14}$ strands, resulting in two hybrid ($S_{15}$/$S_{14}$) molecules.\n- The two $S_{14}$ templates are used to synthesize two new $S_{14}$ strands, resulting in two fully light ($S_{14}$/$S_{14}$) molecules.\n- Population size: $4$ cells.\n- DNA composition: The population contains two cells with hybrid ($S_{15}$/$S_{14}$) DNA and two cells with light ($S_{14}$/$S_{14}$) DNA.\n- Total number of $S_{15}$ strands in the population: remains $2$.\n- Total number of $S_{14}$ strands in the population: $2$ (from Gen 1) + $4$ (newly synthesized in Gen 2) = $6$.\n\n**Generation 3 (After the third round of replication):**\nThe four cells from Generation 2 divide, resulting in eight cells. The DNA from the four cells (two hybrid, two light) replicates.\n- The two hybrid ($S_{15}$/$S_{14}$) molecules unwind, providing two $S_{15}$ templates and two $S_{14}$ templates.\n- The two light ($S_{14}$/$S_{14}$) molecules unwind, providing four $S_{14}$ templates.\n- In total, we have two $S_{15}$ templates and $2+4=6$ $S_{14}$ templates.\n- The two $S_{15}$ templates are used to synthesize two new $S_{14}$ strands, resulting in two hybrid ($S_{15}$/$S_{14}$) molecules.\n- The six $S_{14}$ templates are used to synthesize six new $S_{14}$ strands, resulting in six light ($S_{14}$/$S_{14}$) molecules.\n- Population size: $8$ cells.\n- DNA composition: The final population contains two cells with hybrid ($S_{15}$/$S_{14}$) DNA and six cells with light ($S_{14}$/$S_{14}$) DNA.\n- Total number of $S_{15}$ strands in the population: $2$.\n- Total number of $S_{14}$ strands in the population: $6$ (from Gen 2) + $8$ (newly synthesized in Gen 3) = $14$.\n\nThe two original strands labeled with $^{15}\\text{N}$ are conserved throughout the process; they are never degraded but are passed down to subsequent generations, each acting as a template in every round of replication.

This inhibitor completely blocks the function of DNA helicase, the enzyme responsible for unwinding the Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) double helix, without otherwise harming the cells or their existing DNA.\n\nThe culture is then incubated for a duration exactly equal to the time it would normally take for one complete round of DNA replication and cell division.

Consequently, after shifting from a $^{15}\\text{N}$ medium to a $^{14}\\text{N}$ medium, any new DNA synthesis would incorporate $^{14}\\text{N}$, yielding hybrid ($^{15}\\text{N}$/$^{14}\\text{N}$) DNA after one round of replication under normal conditions.\n\n- In this experiment, before the shift, bacteria have been grown for many generations in $^{15}\\text{N}$, so all chromosomal DNA molecules are fully \"heavy.\"\n\n- Upon transfer to the $^{14}\\text{N}$ medium, a highly specific inhibitor completely blocks DNA helicase. Helicase is essential for creating and advancing replication forks by unwinding the parental duplex; without unwinding, DNA polymerases cannot access single-stranded templates for processive replication.\n\n- Because helicase function is completely inhibited, replication forks cannot form or advance. Therefore, no semiconservative DNA replication occurs during the incubation period, even though the duration matches a normal generation time.\n\n- Since no new DNA synthesis occurs, there is no incorporation of $^{14}\\text{N}$ into DNA. Thus, no hybrid or light DNA is produced. The existing $^{15}\\text{N}$-labeled DNA remains intact (the inhibitor does not damage DNA), so the population’s DNA remains entirely \"heavy.\"\n\n- In CsCl density-gradient centrifugation, intact, fully $^{15}\\text{N}$-labeled DNA will band at the heavy position, yielding a single band at the heavy density. There is no fragmentation to smear the DNA, and no intermediate or light bands can appear without replication.\n\n- Therefore, the expected outcome is a single band at the heavy position.\n\nHence, the correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1483818"}, {"introduction": "Beyond qualitative predictions, a robust understanding of semiconservative replication allows us to make powerful quantitative forecasts about the genetic makeup of a population over time.
