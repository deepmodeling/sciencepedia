By analyzing a hypothetical outcome that deviates from the classic Meselson-Stahl prediction, you will learn to critically evaluate the assumptions underlying an experiment, such as the synchronization of cell division, which is key to interpreting any biological data correctly [@problem_id:1502779].", "problem": "In a hypothetical study inspired by the classic Meselson-Stahl experiment, a population of *E. coli* bacteria is cultured for many generations in a growth medium where the sole nitrogen source is the heavy isotope, ${}^{15}\\text{N}$.

DNA replication in *E. coli* is a mixed process, where conservative, semi-conservative, and dispersive mechanisms occur simultaneously in different cells of the population.\nB. The original bacterial culture was contaminated with a small number of bacteria containing light ${}^{14}\\text{N}$-DNA at the moment of transfer to the new medium.\nC. The bacterial culture was not perfectly synchronized, meaning that at the time of sampling, some cells had not yet replicated, some had completed one round of replication, and some had already completed a second round.\nD. DNA replication is conservative, and the hybrid band is an experimental artifact caused by the physical association of heavy and light DNA molecules during extraction.\nE. The ${}^{15}\\text{N}$ isotope is unstable and spontaneously decays into ${}^{14}\\text{N}$, leading to a mixture of nitrogen isotopes in the DNA strands even before replication begins in the new medium.", "solution": "We begin with the established principle that DNA replication in bacteria such as Escherichia coli is semi-conservative. If all DNA is initially heavy (each duplex is ${}^{15}\\text{N}/${}^{15}\\text{N}$), then after exactly one round of replication in a medium containing only ${}^{14}\\text{N}$, each original heavy duplex yields two hybrid duplexes (${}^{15}\\text{N}/${}^{14}\\text{N}$). Thus, under perfect synchrony and after exactly one round per cell, only a single hybrid band should be observed in a CsCl density gradient.\n\nThe observation of three distinct bands—heavy (${}^{15}\\text{N}/${}^{15}\\text{N}$), hybrid (${}^{15}\\text{N}/${}^{14}\\text{N}$), and light (${}^{14}\\text{N}/${}^{14}\\text{N}$)—implies that, at the time of sampling, the population contained cells in different replication states. To formalize this, let $f_{k}$ denote the fraction of the initial population that has completed $k$ rounds of replication in the ${}^{14}\\text{N}$ medium by the sampling time, with $\\sum_{k\\geq 0} f_{k} = 1$.\n\n- Cells with $k=0$ have not replicated: their DNA remains heavy (${}^{15}\\text{N}/${}^{15}\\text{N}$), producing the heavy band.\n- Cells with $k=1$ have completed exactly one round: their DNA is hybrid (${}^{15}\\text{N}/${}^{14}\\text{N}$), producing the intermediate band.\n- Cells with $k=2$ have completed two rounds: starting from ${}^{15}\\text{N}/${}^{15}\\text{N}$, after one round each duplex is ${}^{15}\\text{N}/${}^{14}\\text{N}$; after a second round, each hybrid duplex yields one hybrid (${}^{15}\\text{N}/${}^{14}\\text{N}$) and one light (${}^{14}\\text{N}/${}^{14}\\text{N}$). Therefore, $k=2$ cells contribute both hybrid and light DNA, in a $1:1$ ratio per original duplex.\n\nBecause the sampling time equals one generation (the time for the total population to double), the total cell number constraint provides:\n$$\nN(T) \\;=\\; N_{0}\\big( f_{0}\\cdot 1 + f_{1}\\cdot 2 + f_{2}\\cdot 4 + \\cdots \\big) \\;=\\; 2N_{0}\n$$\nwhich simplifies to\n$$\nf_{0} + 2 f_{1} + 4 f_{2} + \\cdots \\;=\\; 2,\\quad \\sum_{k\\geq 0} f_{k} = 1.\n$$\nThese equations admit solutions with $f_{0} > 0$ and $f_{2} > 0$ simultaneously (for example, choose any $f_{0}$ with $0 < f_{0} < \\frac{1}{2}$, set $f_{2}=f_{0}$, and $f_{1}=1-2f_{0}$; then $f_{0} + 2(1-2f_{0}) + 4f_{0} = 2$). Hence, even though the total population doubled, some cells may not have replicated at all (heavy band), some completed one round (hybrid band), and some completed two rounds (producing both hybrid and light DNA), yielding three bands in aggregate DNA.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n\n- A: Proposes mixed replication mechanisms across cells. This contradicts the well-established semi-conservative mechanism in E. coli and is unnecessary to explain the data.\n- B: Contamination with ${}^{14}\\text{N}$-DNA cells could account for a light band, but cannot explain the persistence of the heavy band after one generation unless asynchrony is also invoked. It is less parsimonious than asynchrony alone.\n- C: An asynchronous culture naturally yields subpopulations at $k=0,1,2$, satisfying the doubling constraint and producing heavy, hybrid, and light bands as derived above. This directly and plausibly explains the observation.\n- D: Conservative replication would predict heavy and light bands after one generation but no hybrid band; invoking an artifact to create the hybrid band is inconsistent with classic CsCl controls and unnecessary.\n- E: ${}^{15}\\text{N}$ is a stable isotope; it does not spontaneously decay to ${}^{14}\\text{N}$, so this cannot explain the mixture.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation is that the culture was not synchronized, as in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1502779"}]}
