{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The accurate transcription of protein-coding genes is fundamental to life, and RNA Polymerase II is the central enzyme responsible for this task in eukaryotes. To initiate transcription correctly, it relies on a sophisticated set of DNA signals, including core promoters and distant enhancers. This problem asks you to analyze the regulatory architecture of a newly discovered gene and deduce which polymerase is at work, reinforcing your ability to connect specific DNA features to the function of RNA Polymerase II [@problem_id:1487015].", "problem": "A team of geneticists is characterizing a newly identified gene in the mouse genome. Their analysis reveals several key features of its regulatory architecture. The gene possesses a core promoter containing a TATA box, located just upstream of the transcription start site. Further analysis uncovers multiple promoter-proximal elements within 200 base pairs of the promoter. Additionally, a strong enhancer sequence that significantly boosts gene expression is found approximately 10 kilobases (kb) upstream. The transcribed product of this gene is a messenger RNA (mRNA) destined for translation into a critical enzyme for glycolysis.\n\nBased on this detailed description, which of the following enzymes is responsible for transcribing this gene?\n\nA. RNA Polymerase I\n\nB. RNA Polymerase II\n\nC. RNA Polymerase III\n\nD. DNA Polymerase III\n\nE. Telomerase", "solution": "The gene is in a eukaryote (mouse) and produces an mRNA that will be translated into a protein (a glycolytic enzyme). In eukaryotes, the enzyme responsible for transcribing protein-coding genes into mRNA is RNA polymerase II.\n\nThe presence of a TATA box in the core promoter indicates binding by TATA-binding protein (TBP), which is a component of TFIID, a general transcription factor that assembles with RNA polymerase II to form the preinitiation complex. Promoter-proximal elements within roughly 200 base pairs of the promoter are characteristic binding sites for transcription factors that regulate RNA polymerase II transcription. A strong enhancer located approximately 10 kilobases upstream is also a hallmark of RNA polymerase II-regulated genes; enhancers can act at long distances and in an orientation-independent manner by looping to interact with the mediator complex and the RNA polymerase II machinery.\n\nBy contrast, RNA polymerase I transcribes most ribosomal RNA (28S, 18S, 5.8S), RNA polymerase III transcribes tRNAs and 5S rRNA (and some small RNAs), DNA polymerase III is a prokaryotic DNA replication enzyme, and telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that extends telomeres, not a nuclear RNA polymerase for mRNA synthesis.\n\nTherefore, the enzyme responsible for transcribing this gene is RNA polymerase II.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1487015"}, {"introduction": "While many genes have their primary control switches located upstream, eukaryotic cells have evolved diverse strategies for gene regulation. RNA Polymerase III, in particular, often utilizes a surprising mechanism for transcribing genes like those for transfer RNA (tRNA). This exercise presents an experimental puzzle that challenges the conventional notion of a promoter's location, prompting you to consider how transcription can be accurately initiated even when the entire upstream region is missing [@problem_id:1487022].", "problem": "A molecular biology student is investigating the transcriptional regulation of a gene encoding a specific transfer RNA (tRNA) in a eukaryotic system. Using recombinant DNA technology, the student creates a mutant version of this gene where the entire 5' flanking region, extending several hundred base pairs upstream from the transcription start site, has been completely deleted. This modified DNA is then used as a template in a cell-free in vitro transcription assay, which includes purified RNA Polymerase III, all the necessary general transcription factors (TFs), and a supply of ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs). To the student's surprise, the assay successfully produces tRNA transcripts of the expected length.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate explanation for this observation?\n\nA. RNA Polymerase III does not require a promoter and can initiate transcription at any random position on the DNA template.\n\nB. The essential promoter elements required for the initiation of transcription by RNA Polymerase III for this gene are located within the DNA sequence that is transcribed into RNA.\n\nC. The general transcription factors for RNA Polymerase III bind to the 3' untranscribed region downstream of the gene, recruiting the polymerase from that end.\n\nD. In the absence of the normal promoter, RNA Polymerase II first transcribes the gene, and the resulting precursor RNA is then processed to form the mature tRNA.\n\nE. The purified RNA Polymerase III enzyme preparation was contaminated with a DNA repair enzyme that reconstructed the missing 5' promoter sequence in the test tube.", "solution": "Fundamental principle: In eukaryotes, most tRNA genes are transcribed by RNA Polymerase III using internal promoter elements embedded within the transcribed region of the gene. Specifically, these are the A box and B box internal control regions. The general transcription factor TFIIIC recognizes and binds these internal elements, then recruits TFIIIB to a site upstream of the transcription start site, assembling a preinitiation complex that positions RNA Polymerase III for accurate initiation.\n\nLogical steps applied to the experiment:\n1. The student deleted the entire 5' flanking region upstream of the transcription start site. If initiation required an external upstream promoter, transcription would fail.\n2. However, tRNA genes use internal promoters within the coding region; thus the necessary promoter elements remain intact despite removal of the 5' flanking DNA.\n3. The in vitro system supplied RNA Polymerase III and its general transcription factors, enabling TFIIIC to bind the internal A and B boxes and recruit TFIIIB and RNA Polymerase III for initiation at the correct site, producing correctly sized tRNA transcripts.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because RNA Polymerase III requires promoter elements; it does not initiate randomly.\n- B is correct because the essential promoter elements for tRNA genes are within the transcribed region.\n- C is incorrect because, for tRNA genes, promoter control is internal to the transcribed region, not in the 3' untranscribed downstream region.\n- D is incorrect because tRNA genes are transcribed by RNA Polymerase III, not RNA Polymerase II.\n- E is implausible and unnecessary given the established internal promoter mechanism.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is that the essential promoter elements reside within the transcribed region of the tRNA gene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1487022"}, {"introduction": "In biology, understanding the general rules is just as important as recognizing the exceptions, which often reveal deeper evolutionary and functional insights. While we can draw clear distinctions between the promoter types for RNA Polymerase II and most RNA Polymerase III genes, some genes blur these lines. This question focuses on the U6 snRNA gene, a fascinating case that forces you to integrate your knowledge, as it is a target of Polymerase III but employs a promoter structure typically associated with Polymerase II [@problem_id:1486991].", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, three distinct ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerases are responsible for transcribing different classes of genes. RNA polymerase I transcribes most ribosomal RNA genes, RNA polymerase II transcribes all protein-coding genes and some small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes, and RNA polymerase III transcribes genes for transfer RNAs (tRNAs), 5S ribosomal RNA, and other small RNAs, including the U6 snRNA.\n\nThe promoter elements that direct transcription initiation are structurally diverse. For genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II, essential promoter elements are typically located upstream of the transcription start site. In contrast, the promoters for most genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III (e.g., tRNA and 5S rRNA genes) are of an internal type, meaning their critical control elements (like Box A, Box B, and Box C) are located downstream of the transcription start site, within the transcribed region of the gene itself.\n\nThe gene for U6 snRNA represents a notable exception to these general rules. Although it is transcribed by RNA polymerase III, its promoter architecture is highly unusual when compared to the vast majority of other Pol III-transcribed genes. Which of the following statements accurately describes the key structural feature that makes the U6 snRNA gene promoter distinct from typical RNA polymerase III promoters?\n\nA. Its promoter elements are located entirely downstream of the transcription start site, embedded within the gene's transcribed sequence.\n\nB. It is the only RNA polymerase III promoter that is composed exclusively of repetitive guanine-cytosine (GC) rich sequences.\n\nC. Its essential promoter elements, including a TATA-like box, are located entirely upstream of the transcription start site.\n\nD. It completely lacks recognizable promoter elements and relies on the structure of the surrounding chromatin to recruit RNA polymerase III.", "solution": "RNA polymerase III commonly uses internal promoters for tRNA and 5S rRNA genes, where essential control elements such as Box A, Box B, and Box C lie within the transcribed region downstream of the transcription start site. In contrast, RNA polymerase II promoters typically contain upstream elements, including a TATA box near the start site.\n\nThe U6 snRNA gene is an exception among RNA polymerase III-transcribed genes: despite being transcribed by RNA polymerase III, its promoter resembles a Pol II-type architecture. Specifically, the U6 promoter contains essential upstream elements, including a TATA-like box located approximately upstream of the transcription start site, along with other upstream regulatory elements such as a proximal sequence element. Thus, its key distinguishing structural feature is the upstream location of essential promoter elements rather than internal promoter elements.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because it describes the typical internal promoters of tRNA and 5S rRNA genes, not U6.\n- B is incorrect because GC-rich composition is not the defining feature of the U6 promoter.\n- C is correct because the U6 promoter contains essential upstream elements, including a TATA-like box.\n- D is incorrect because the U6 promoter has well-characterized promoter elements and does not rely solely on chromatin structure.\n\nTherefore, the accurate statement is that its essential promoter elements, including a TATA-like box, are located upstream of the transcription start site.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1486991"}]}
