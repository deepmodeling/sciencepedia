Cells must precisely control protein activity, and one of the most elegant mechanisms for this is allosteric regulation. This practice problem [@problem_id:1532466] explores a classic case of feedback inhibition, where the final product of a metabolic pathway binds to and inhibits an early enzyme, preventing wasteful overproduction. Mastering this concept is key to understanding how cells maintain metabolic homeostasis.", "problem": "A team of biochemists is studying a newly discovered bacterium that thrives in high-pressure deep-sea vents. This bacterium produces a crucial cryoprotectant molecule, which we will call 'cryostabilin', that prevents ice crystal formation within its cytoplasm. The biosynthesis of cryostabilin is a multi-step metabolic pathway, beginning with a precursor molecule 'X'. The first enzymatic step in this pathway is catalyzed by the enzyme 'X-convertase'. The researchers observe that as the concentration of cryostabilin increases within the cell, molecules of cryostabilin begin to bind directly to the X-convertase enzyme. This binding event occurs at a regulatory site that is physically distinct from the enzyme's active site, where molecule 'X' normally binds. The binding of cryostabilin to this regulatory site induces a conformational change in X-convertase, significantly reducing its catalytic activity. This inhibition is reversible; if the cellular concentration of cryostabilin falls, it detaches from the enzyme, restoring its full activity.\n\nWhich of the following terms best describes this specific method of cellular regulation?\n\nA. Transcriptional attenuation\n\nB. Competitive inhibition\n\nC. Allosteric feedback inhibition\n\nD. RNA interference (RNAi)\n\nE. Covalent modification", "solution": "The scenario describes the end product of a metabolic pathway (cryostabilin) binding to a site on the first enzyme (X-convertase) that is distinct from the active site and thereby decreasing the enzyme’s catalytic activity. This binding is reversible and depends on the concentration of the end product in the cell. Such binding at a site other than the active site defines allosteric regulation, and when the regulator is the end product of the pathway that inhibits an upstream step, it is specifically feedback inhibition.\n\nEliminating alternatives:\n- Transcriptional attenuation regulates gene expression at the level of transcription, not by direct modulation of enzyme activity through metabolite binding.\n- Competitive inhibition involves a molecule competing with the substrate for the active site; here, binding occurs at a distinct regulatory site, not the active site.\n- RNA interference (RNAi) reduces gene expression post-transcriptionally via small RNAs targeting mRNA, not by direct enzyme inhibition through metabolite binding.\n- Covalent modification implies enzyme regulation via covalent attachment (e.g., phosphorylation), whereas the described inhibition is through reversible, noncovalent binding at an allosteric site.\n\nTherefore, the method described is best classified as allosteric feedback inhibition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1532466"}, {"introduction": "Regulation can also occur before a protein is even made, by controlling its translation from messenger RNA. This exercise [@problem_id:1532435] introduces the concept of a riboswitch, a remarkable regulatory segment of an mRNA that can directly bind a small molecule and switch off translation. By applying principles of chemical equilibrium, you will calculate how the concentration of a metabolite can quantitatively control gene expression at the translational level.", "problem": "In a certain species of bacterium, the synthesis of a vital enzyme is regulated by a negative feedback mechanism at the level of translation. The enzyme's product, a small vitamin molecule, can directly bind to a specific structure within the 5' Untranslated Region (5' UTR) of the enzyme's messenger RNA (mRNA). In the absence of the vitamin, the 5' UTR adopts a conformation that permits efficient initiation of translation by the ribosome. When the vitamin binds to the 5' UTR, it induces a conformational change that stalls the ribosome, effectively halting the synthesis of the enzyme. This binding process is reversible.\n\nLet the dissociation constant, $K_d$, for the binding of the vitamin to the mRNA's 5' UTR be $45.5$ nM. Assuming this binding reaction is at equilibrium within the cell, calculate the intracellular concentration of the vitamin that would reduce the rate of enzyme synthesis to exactly 20% of its maximum possible rate (i.e., the rate observed in the complete absence of the vitamin).\n\nExpress your answer in nanomolar (nM), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $M$ denote the mRNA 5' UTR, $L$ the vitamin, and $ML$ the bound complex.

The factor exists in two states: an unphosphorylated form (CSF-U) and a phosphorylated form (CSF-P). A specific cellular kinase converts CSF-U to CSF-P, a reaction that can be modeled as a first-order process with a rate constant $k_p$. Conversely, a phosphatase converts CSF-P back to CSF-U, also a first-order process with a rate constant $k_d$.\n\nThe cell's degradation machinery, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, exclusively recognizes and degrades the unphosphorylated form, CSF-U. This degradation is modeled as a first-order decay process with a rate constant $k_{deg}$.
