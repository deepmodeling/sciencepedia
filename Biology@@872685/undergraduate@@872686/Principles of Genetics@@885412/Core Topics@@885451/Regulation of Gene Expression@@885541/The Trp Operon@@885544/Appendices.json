The Trp operon's repression system is a prime example, where a repressor protein, activated by tryptophan, blocks gene expression. This exercise [@problem_id:1529092] challenges you to predict the outcome of a 'super-repressor' mutation that keeps the switch permanently off, providing a clear and powerful illustration of negative control and its consequences for the cell's metabolism.", "problem": "In *Escherichia coli*, the synthesis of the amino acid tryptophan is regulated by the *trp* operon. This operon includes a regulatory gene, $trpR$, which produces a repressor protein, and a set of structural genes (`trpE`, `trpD`, `trpC`, `trpB`, `trpA`) that encode the enzymes for the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway. The expression of the structural genes is controlled by the binding of the repressor protein to an operator site, $trpO$. In wild-type cells, the repressor protein is synthesized in an inactive form. It only binds to the operator and halts transcription when it forms a complex with its corepressor, tryptophan. Consequently, wild-type *E. coli* can grow on a minimal medium lacking tryptophan, as they can synthesize their own.\n\nA geneticist isolates a mutant strain with a specific mutation in the $trpR$ gene, designated $trpR^S$. The protein product of this $trpR^S$ allele is a \"super-repressor\" that has an altered conformation, allowing it to bind to the wild-type operator site $trpO$ even in the complete absence of tryptophan.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the phenotype of this $trpR^S$ mutant strain?\n\nA. The structural genes of the *trp* operon will be transcribed constitutively, leading to an overproduction of tryptophan.\n\nB. The cell will exhibit a wild-type phenotype, with transcription of the *trp* operon being appropriately regulated by the intracellular concentration of tryptophan.\n\nC. The structural genes of the *trp* operon will be permanently repressed, and the cell will be unable to grow on a minimal medium unless it is supplemented with tryptophan.\n\nD. The presence of lactose in the medium will be required to induce transcription of the *trp* operon structural genes.\n\nE. The cell will only be able to transcribe the *trp* operon structural genes when tryptophan is present at high concentrations in the medium.", "solution": "Wild-type principle: The $trp$ operon is a repressible system. The regulatory gene $trpR$ encodes a repressor that is synthesized in an inactive form. Binding of tryptophan (the corepressor) converts the repressor to its active conformation, which then binds the operator $trpO$ and blocks RNA polymerase from transcribing the structural genes `trpE`, `trpD`, `trpC`, `trpB`, `trpA`. Therefore, in the absence of tryptophan, the repressor remains inactive, does not bind $trpO$, and the operon is transcribed to synthesize tryptophan.\n\nMutant mechanism: In the $trpR^S$ super-repressor allele, the repressor protein has an altered conformation that allows it to bind $trpO$ even without tryptophan. Thus, operator binding becomes independent of corepressor and is constitutive. When the operator is occupied by the repressor, RNA polymerase is blocked from initiating transcription of the structural genes, so the operon remains off regardless of tryptophan concentration.\n\nPhenotypic consequence: Because transcription of `trpE` through `trpA` is repressed constitutively, the enzymes for tryptophan biosynthesis are not produced. The cell cannot synthesize tryptophan and therefore cannot grow on minimal medium unless tryptophan is supplied.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because constitutive transcription would require a loss of repressor function or an operator-constitutive mutation preventing repressor binding; the super-repressor causes constitutive repression, not expression.\n- B is incorrect because regulation is no longer responsive to intracellular tryptophan; repression occurs even when tryptophan is absent.\n- C is correct: the structural genes are permanently repressed, making the strain a tryptophan auxotroph that requires tryptophan supplementation.\n- D is incorrect because lactose regulates the lac operon, not the trp operon.\n- E is incorrect because the super-repressor binds without tryptophan and remains bound even at high tryptophan; tryptophan does not relieve repression in this mutant.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the operon is permanently repressed and requires tryptophan supplementation for growth.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1529092"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple repression, the Trp operon features a second, more elegant regulatory layer: attenuation. This mechanism fine-tunes expression by sensing the availability of charged $tRNA^{\\mathrm{Trp}}$ via a 'sensor' sequence in the leader mRNA. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1529113] asks you to dissect this very mechanism by altering its sensory codons, forcing a deeper look at the interplay between transcription and translation that lies at the heart of attenuation.", "problem": "In *Escherichia coli*, the biosynthesis of the amino acid tryptophan is regulated by the *trp* operon. This system employs two layers of control: repression and attenuation. This problem focuses on the attenuation mechanism, which fine-tunes the expression of the structural genes (`trpE`, `trpD`, `trpC`, `trpB`, `trpA`).\n\nAttenuation occurs in the leader region (`trpL`), located upstream of the structural genes. This leader sequence contains four distinct regions (1, 2, 3, and 4) that can form alternative stem-loop secondary structures in the transcribed mRNA. The formation of a stem-loop between regions 2 and 3 acts as an anti-terminator, allowing transcription to proceed. Conversely, the formation of a stem-loop between regions 3 and 4 acts as a rho-independent terminator, halting transcription prematurely.\n\nCrucially, the leader sequence also contains a short open reading frame that codes for a 14-amino-acid leader peptide. Within the coding sequence for this peptide are two adjacent codons for tryptophan. The rate of translation of this leader peptide dictates which stem-loop structure forms.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered mutant strain of *E. coli*. In this strain, the two adjacent tryptophan codons in the `trpL` gene have been mutated to codons that specify the amino acid alanine. The primary repression system, involving the Trp repressor protein and the operator sequence, remains fully functional. Assuming that the cellular concentration of charged tRNA for alanine ($tRNA^{\\mathrm{Ala}}$) is always high and not a limiting factor for translation, what is the most likely consequence of this mutation on the regulation of the *trp* operon?\n\nA. The expression of the *trp* structural genes will be significantly reduced under all tryptophan concentrations due to constitutive attenuation.\n\nB. The expression of the *trp* structural genes will be constitutively high, regardless of tryptophan concentration, as attenuation will be completely abolished.\n\nC. The attenuation mechanism will not be affected, and the expression of the structural genes will continue to be regulated by tryptophan levels.\n\nD. The mutation will prevent the Trp repressor protein from binding to the operator, leading to constitutive expression of the operon.\n\nE. The expression of the *trp* operon will now be regulated by the intracellular concentration of alanine instead of tryptophan.", "solution": "We analyze attenuation in the trp operon by tracking how ribosome position on the leader mRNA dictates which RNA secondary structure forms.\n\n1) Wild-type attenuation logic:\n- The leader mRNA has regions 1, 2, 3, 4 that can pair to form either the 2-3 antiterminator or the 3-4 terminator.\n- Translation of the leader peptide begins while transcription proceeds. The leader peptide includes two adjacent Trp codons.\n- If $[\\mathrm{Trp}]$ is high, charged $tRNA^{\\mathrm{Trp}}$ is abundant, the ribosome translates through the two Trp codons without stalling, moves into and covers region 2, thereby preventing 2-3 pairing. Consequently, regions 3 and 4 pair to form the intrinsic terminator, and transcription terminates prematurely. Symbolically: high $[\\mathrm{Trp}] \\Rightarrow$ no stall at Trp codons $\\Rightarrow$ 2 is occluded $\\Rightarrow$ 3-4 forms $\\Rightarrow$ termination.\n- If $[\\mathrm{Trp}]$ is low, charged $tRNA^{\\mathrm{Trp}}$ is scarce, the ribosome stalls at the two Trp codons in region 1, leaving region 2 free. Regions 2 and 3 pair to form the antiterminator, allowing RNA polymerase to transcribe the structural genes. Symbolically: low $[\\mathrm{Trp}] \\Rightarrow$ stall at Trp codons in 1 $\\Rightarrow$ 2 free $\\Rightarrow$ 2-3 forms $\\Rightarrow$ readthrough.\n\n2) Effect of the mutation:\n- In the mutant, the two Trp codons in trpL are replaced by Ala codons. By assumption, the cellular concentration of charged $tRNA^{\\mathrm{Ala}}$ is always high and not limiting.\n- Therefore, the ribosome will not stall at these positions regardless of $[\\mathrm{Trp}]$; translation of the leader peptide proceeds rapidly through the region that normally senses tryptophan.\n- As in the high-tryptophan wild-type scenario, the ribosome will enter and occlude region 2, preventing 2-3 pairing and favoring 3-4 terminator formation. This yields constitutive attenuation.\n- Thus, attenuation becomes insensitive to $[\\mathrm{Trp}]$ and is effectively “always on,” reducing transcription into the structural genes at all tryptophan levels, provided transcription initiates.\n\n3) Role of the primary repression system:\n- The Trp repressor-operator system remains intact and will still repress when $[\\mathrm{Trp}]$ is high. However, under low $[\\mathrm{Trp}]$, although repression would normally be relieved, the constitutive attenuation in the mutant will still cause premature termination, keeping expression low.\n\n4) Evaluation of options:\n- A matches the prediction: constitutive attenuation leads to significantly reduced expression under all tryptophan concentrations.\n- B is incorrect: abolishing attenuation would require preventing 3-4 formation or otherwise ensuring stable 2-3 formation; replacing Trp codons with Ala codons that are efficiently translated does the opposite.\n- C is incorrect: the attenuation mechanism is altered and no longer responds to $[\\mathrm{Trp}]$.\n- D is incorrect: the mutation is in the leader peptide coding region, not the operator; repressor binding is unaffected.\n- E is incorrect: although attenuation can be sensitive to the availability of the cognate charged tRNA for the codons in the leader, the assumption explicitly states $tRNA^{\\mathrm{Ala}}$ is always abundant, so regulation does not switch to alanine; moreover, the primary repression remains tryptophan-dependent.\n\nTherefore, the most likely consequence is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1529113"}, {"introduction": "Qualitative understanding of regulatory mechanisms is the first step, but quantitative insight reveals their true biological impact.

The expression of this operon is controlled by two primary mechanisms: repression and attenuation.\n\n1.  **Repression**: In the presence of high intracellular Trp concentrations, the TrpR repressor protein, activated by Trp, binds to the operator site ($trpO$). This binding reduces the transcription initiation rate by a repression factor, $F_{\\text{rep}}$.\n2.  **Attenuation**: A secondary mechanism involves a leader sequence (`trpL`) that can terminate transcription prematurely.
