The mRNA sequence is identical to the coding strand except that uracil (U) replaces thymine (T). This follows the base-pairing rules: in RNA, A pairs with U, and G pairs with C; consequently, the mRNA matches the coding strand with T replaced by U.\n\nTherefore, starting from the first nucleotide as specified, the mRNA sequence is 5'-AUGCGUACCAUUGCAGUC-3'.

One such mechanism involves the \"race\" between the transcribing RNA polymerase and the translating ribosome, which can influence transcription termination. This advanced problem [@problem_id:1530424] presents a quantitative model to explore how changes in translation speed can expose the nascent mRNA to termination factors like the Rho protein, providing a deeper understanding of how cellular processes are coordinated to control gene expression.", "problem": "In prokaryotic gene expression, transcription and translation are coupled processes. This coupling is crucial for certain regulatory mechanisms, including rho-dependent transcription termination. The Rho protein is a helicase that can bind to specific sequences on the nascent messenger RNA (mRNA) and translocate along the transcript, chasing the transcribing RNA polymerase (RNAP). If Rho catches the RNAP, it can induce termination. However, ribosomes translating the same mRNA act as physical barriers, preventing Rho's movement. Consequently, premature termination is often prevented because ribosomes closely follow the RNAP, shielding the mRNA.\n\nConsider a model for premature rho-dependent termination within a specific bacterial gene. In this model, termination becomes possible only if the length of \"naked\" mRNA between the leading edge of the RNAP and the trailing edge of the lead ribosome exceeds a certain critical distance, $d_{\\text{critical}}$. Let the probability of a termination event, $P_{\\text{term}}$, be given by the formula $P_{\\text{term}} = 1 - \\exp(-k \\cdot T_{\\text{exposed}})$, where $T_{\\text{exposed}}$ is the total time during which this gap is greater than $d_{\\text{critical}}$, and $k$ is a rate constant.\n\nYou are studying a gene with a total length $L_{\\text{gene}} = 3000$ nucleotides. In its wild-type form, the gene is translated efficiently, and the small, constant gap between the RNAP and the lead ribosome is $d_{\\text{initial}} = 40$ nucleotides, which is less than the critical distance required for termination. A mutant allele of this gene is created where a 30-nucleotide-long segment of optimal codons, starting at position $x_{\\text{start}} = 500$ nucleotides from the transcription start site, is replaced by a cluster of rare codons. This mutation dramatically slows down translation over this specific region.\n\nAssume the following constant parameters for your analysis:\n-   RNA polymerase (RNAP) transcription velocity, $v_{\\text{RNAP}} = 50$ nucleotides/s.\n-   Ribosome translation velocity on optimal codons, $v_{\\text{trans, opt}} = 50$ nucleotides/s.\n-   Ribosome translation velocity on the rare codon cluster, $v_{\\text{trans, rare}} = 5$ nucleotides/s.\n-   Critical RNAP-ribosome gap distance for termination, $d_{\\text{critical}} = 100$ nucleotides.\n-   Termination rate constant, $k = 0.01$ s$^{-1}$.\n\nAssuming the wild-type allele has a premature termination probability of zero, calculate the probability of premature rho-dependent termination for the mutant allele.

In the wild type, $v_{\\text{RNAP}}=v_{\\text{trans,opt}}$, so $d(t)=d_{\\text{initial}}<d_{\\text{critical}}$ at all times, which implies $T_{\\text{exposed}}=0$ and hence $P_{\\text{term}}=0$, as stated.\n\nFor the mutant, set $t=0$ when the ribosome begins translating the rare-codon cluster at $x_{\\text{start}}$.
