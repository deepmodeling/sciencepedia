Consider two adjacent parenchyma cells, a \"source\" cell and a \"sink\" cell, separated by a cell wall of uniform thickness. A small, water-soluble signaling molecule is produced in the source cell and consumed in the sink cell, maintaining a constant concentration $C_1$ in the source cell's cytoplasm and a lower constant concentration $C_2$ in the sink cell's cytoplasm.\n\nAssume that transport of this molecule between the cells occurs exclusively through the plasmodesmata. Each plasmodesma can be modeled as a cylindrical channel of radius $r_p$ and length $L$ (equal to the cell wall thickness). Inside each channel is a central, impermeable cylindrical structure called a desmotubule, with radius $r_d$. The molecule diffuses only through the annular region between the channel wall and the desmotubule, known as the cytoplasmic sleeve. The plasmodesmata are distributed uniformly over the cell wall with a density of $\\rho_{pd}$ (number of plasmodesmata per unit area of the cell wall). The diffusion coefficient of the molecule within the cytoplasm of the sleeve is $D$.\n\nDerive a closed-form analytic expression for the net flux of the signaling molecule, $J_{net}$, across the cell wall. This flux should be defined as the total number of moles of the molecule passing from the source cell to the sink cell per unit time, per unit area of the cell wall.

This exercise explores how a key physiological stress—water loss and reduced turgor pressure—influences plasmodesmatal function [@problem_id:1768488]. By considering a fluorescent tracer experiment, you will connect the physical principles of transport to the biological reality of dynamic regulation.", "problem": "A botanist is investigating the dynamic nature of cell-to-cell communication in plants. They use a microinjection technique to introduce a fluorescent, water-soluble tracer molecule into the cytoplasm of a single epidermal cell on a leaf. The tracer molecule has a molecular weight that places its size just below the typical Size Exclusion Limit (SEL) of plasmodesmata, allowing it to diffuse into neighboring cells under normal physiological conditions.\n\nThe botanist prepares two leaf samples from the same plant. Sample A is kept well-hydrated, ensuring its cells maintain high turgor pressure. Sample B is left in a dry environment until it begins to show signs of wilting, indicating a significant loss of turgor pressure in its cells, but not to the point of severe plasmolysis where the plasma membrane detaches from the cell wall.\n\nThe tracer is then injected into a single epidermal cell in both Sample A and Sample B. After a set period, the extent of the tracer's diffusion into the surrounding tissue is observed using fluorescence microscopy. Which of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of this experiment?\n\nA. The tracer will spread to fewer cells in Sample B compared to Sample A because the reduced turgor pressure causes a constriction of the plasmodesmatal channels.\n\nB. The tracer will spread to more cells in Sample B compared to Sample A because the flaccid cell walls offer less resistance to molecular transport.\n\nC. The spread of the tracer will be identical in both Sample A and Sample B because the structure of plasmodesmata is fixed and unaffected by turgor pressure.\n\nD. The tracer will not spread at all in Sample B because the loss of turgor pressure causes the plasmodesmata to be completely and permanently severed.\n\nE. The tracer will spread to more cells in Sample B compared to Sample A because the lower pressure in the wilted cells creates a 'suction' that actively pulls the tracer from the injected cell.", "solution": "We identify the transport pathway as symplastic movement through plasmodesmata. For a small, water-soluble tracer with size just below the typical Size Exclusion Limit (SEL), passive diffusion through plasmodesmata is the dominant mechanism under normal conditions. The diffusive flux between adjacent cells is governed by Fick’s law, and for transport through a cylindrical pore, the effective permeability is proportional to the pore cross-sectional area and inversely proportional to its length. Writing the effective intercellular permeability as\n$$\nP \\propto D \\frac{A}{L} = D \\frac{\\pi r^{2}}{L},\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the tracer’s diffusion coefficient in the pore, $A$ is the cross-sectional area, $r$ is the effective pore radius at the plasmodesmatal neck, and $L$ is the effective pore length. The net diffusive flux between two adjacent cells can be written as\n$$\n\\Phi = P \\Delta c,\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta c$ is the concentration difference across the pore. Thus, any reduction in the effective radius $r$ reduces $A$ and therefore reduces $P$ and $\\Phi$, limiting spread into neighboring cells.\n\nPlasmodesmata are dynamically regulated. Under osmotic or drought stress (as in wilting), plants typically increase callose deposition at the plasmodesmatal neck, which decreases the effective radius $r$ and reduces the SEL. This lowers symplastic permeability and restricts movement of even sub-SEL tracers. Moreover, reduced turgor diminishes any pressure-driven bulk flow component; there is no “suction” mechanism that actively pulls solutes—passive diffusion depends primarily on concentration gradients and pore permeability, not on a lower hydrostatic pressure per se. The structure of plasmodesmata is not fixed; gating is reversible and regulated (e.g., via callose synthases and beta-1,3-glucanases). In this scenario, plasmodesmata are not completely severed because severe plasmolysis has not occurred, but their aperture is expected to be reduced under wilting stress.\n\nApplying these principles:\n- Sample A (high turgor): lower callose at plasmodesmata, larger effective $r$, larger $A$, higher $P$, so greater tracer spread.\n- Sample B (wilted, low turgor): stress-induced narrowing of plasmodesmata (smaller $r$), smaller $A$, lower $P$, so reduced tracer spread.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is correct: reduced turgor associated with wilting correlates with plasmodesmatal constriction and decreased symplastic permeability, so fewer cells show tracer in Sample B.\n- B is incorrect: flaccidity does not widen pores; plasmodesmata narrow under stress.\n- C is incorrect: plasmodesmata are dynamically gated; structure and SEL are not fixed.\n- D is incorrect: without severe plasmolysis, plasmodesmata are not completely severed; transport is reduced, not abolished.\n- E is incorrect: there is no active “suction” pulling tracer; pressure differences do not override the dominant reduction in permeability and diffusion is governed by $\\Delta c$ and $P$.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1768488"}, {"introduction": "The ability to regulate plasmodesmatal permeability is critical for a plant's survival, especially when under attack.

The viral infection begins in the first cell at time $t=0$. The virus has a characteristic replication time, $T_{rep}$, which is the time it requires to replicate within a host cell to a sufficient concentration to begin infecting adjacent cells.\n\nAfter replication is complete, the virus moves to an adjacent cell through a plasmodesma. The time taken for this transit, $T_{move}$, is found to be inversely proportional to the effective cross-sectional area of the plasmodesmatal pore.\n\nThe biologist compares two types of plants: a wild-type (WT) and a mutant (MT).\n- In the **wild-type (WT)** plant, the cell's defense mechanism responds to infection by depositing callose, a polysaccharide that constricts the plasmodesmatal pore to a smaller, stable radius $r_{WT}$.\n- The **mutant (MT)** plant is deficient in the enzyme callose synthase, meaning it cannot produce callose to constrict its plasmodesmata. Consequently, the pores remain at their initial, unconstricted radius, $r_0$.\n\nFor the MT plant with its open plasmodesmata, the movement time is observed to be a fraction of the replication time, given by $T_{move, MT} = \\beta T_{rep}$. The ratio of the constricted radius in the WT plant to the open radius in the MT plant is given by the dimensionless constant $\\gamma = \\frac{r_{WT}}{r_0}$.\n\nThe velocity of the infection front, $v$, is defined as the number of new cells infected per unit time.
