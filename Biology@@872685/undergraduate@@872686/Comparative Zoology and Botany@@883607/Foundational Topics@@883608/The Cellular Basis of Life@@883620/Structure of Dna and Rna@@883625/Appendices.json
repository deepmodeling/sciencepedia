This exercise provides a foundational test of your understanding of Chargaff's rules, which form the quantitative basis for the Watson-Crick model.

Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "Let the molar fractions of the four bases be denoted by $f_{A}$, $f_{T}$, $f_{G}$, and $f_{C}$. By Chargaff’s rules for double-stranded DNA under Watson-Crick pairing, we have:\n$$\nf_{A} = f_{T}, \\quad f_{G} = f_{C}, \\quad f_{A} + f_{T} + f_{G} + f_{C} = 1.\n$$\nGiven $f_{C} = 0.22$, it follows that:\n$$\nf_{G} = 0.22 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad f_{G} + f_{C} = 0.44.\n$$\nTherefore:\n$$\nf_{A} + f_{T} = 1 - 0.44 = 0.56.\n$$\nUsing $f_{A} = f_{T}$, we obtain:\n$$\nf_{A} = \\frac{0.56}{2} = 0.28.\n$$\nThus, the proportion that is adenine is $0.28$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.28}$$", "id": "2304972"}, {"introduction": "The base composition of a DNA molecule has profound consequences for its physical properties. This problem explores the concept of DNA melting temperature ($T_m$), a critical measure of the helix's thermal stability, and challenges you to connect it to the underlying molecular structure [@problem_id:2304950]. Understanding the relationship between Guanine-Cytosine content and thermal stability is essential for laboratory techniques like PCR and for appreciating how organisms' genomes are adapted to their thermal environments.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is studying the genomes of two newly discovered extremophilic bacteria. The first species, *Ignicoccus thermophilus*, was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent and thrives at temperatures near boiling point. The second species, *Glacibacter frigoris*, was found within an Antarctic ice core and is adapted to sub-zero temperatures.\n\nThe biologist isolates a particular gene of identical length, 1200 base pairs, from both organisms. A subsequent sequence analysis reveals that the gene from *Ignicoccus thermophilus* has a Guanine-Cytosine (G-C) content of 72%. In contrast, the homologous gene from *Glacibacter frigoris* has a G-C content of 38%.\n\nThe melting temperature ($T_m$) of DNA is defined as the temperature at which 50% of the double-stranded DNA molecules in a solution have denatured into single strands. Based on the fundamental principles of nucleic acid structure, which of the following statements correctly predicts the relative melting temperatures of these two genes and provides the correct scientific rationale?\n\nA. The gene from *Glacibacter frigoris* will have a higher $T_m$ because the stacking interactions between Adenine-Thymine pairs are stronger than those between Guanine-Cytosine pairs.\n\nB. Both genes will have the same $T_m$ because melting temperature is determined solely by the length of the DNA fragment, and both genes are 1200 base pairs long.\n\nC. The gene from *Ignicoccus thermophilus* will have a higher $T_m$ because Guanine and Cytosine are larger purine and pyrimidine bases, respectively, leading to a more stable structure.\n\nD. The gene from *Ignicoccus thermophilus* will have a higher $T_m$ because a Guanine-Cytosine base pair is joined by three hydrogen bonds, whereas an Adenine-Thymine pair is joined by only two.\n\nE. The gene from *Glacibacter frigoris* will have a higher $T_m$ because the lower G-C content allows for a tighter helical twist, which increases thermal stability.", "solution": "We are comparing melting temperatures of two DNA genes of equal length $L=1200$ base pairs, with different G-C fractions: for Ignicoccus thermophilus, $f_{GC}^{(I)}=0.72$, and for Glacibacter frigoris, $f_{GC}^{(G)}=0.38$. The melting temperature $T_{m}$ is the temperature at which half of the duplex molecules are denatured. The thermodynamic stability of a DNA duplex is governed primarily by two factors: hydrogen bonding between complementary bases and base-stacking interactions. A Guanine-Cytosine base pair forms three hydrogen bonds, whereas an Adenine-Thymine base pair forms two hydrogen bonds. Therefore, at fixed length and solution conditions, increasing the fraction of G-C pairs increases duplex stability and thus increases $T_{m}$. This qualitative dependence is standard and can be summarized as: for two sequences of the same length under the same conditions, $T_{m}$ is an increasing function of $N_{GC}$ (or equivalently $f_{GC}$). Since $f_{GC}^{(I)}  f_{GC}^{(G)}$, it follows that $T_{m}^{(I)}  T_{m}^{(G)}$.\n\nNow evaluate the statements:\n- A is incorrect because Adenine-Thymine stacking interactions are not stronger than those of Guanine-Cytosine on average, and A-T pairs also have fewer hydrogen bonds.\n- B is incorrect because $T_{m}$ depends on base composition (and ionic strength), not solely on length; holding $L$ fixed, higher G-C content increases $T_{m}$.\n- C is incorrect because the rationale is wrong: both A-T and G-C pairs are purine-pyrimidine pairs with matched geometry; the higher stability of G-C is not due to larger base size but to the additional hydrogen bond (and generally stronger stacking).\n- D is correct: a G-C pair has three hydrogen bonds while an A-T pair has two, so higher G-C content increases duplex stability and $T_{m}$.\n- E is incorrect because lower G-C content does not lead to a tighter helix that increases thermal stability; in fact, lower G-C content reduces stability and lowers $T_{m}$.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2304950"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its linear sequence and thermal stability, the three-dimensional shape, or topology, of a DNA molecule is critical for its biological function and experimental analysis. This practice asks you to predict the outcome of a common laboratory technique, agarose gel electrophoresis, based on the different conformations of a plasmid [@problem_id:2304960]. This scenario beautifully illustrates how the macroscopic behavior of molecules in an experiment is a direct consequence of their microscopic shape and compactness.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is working with a specific type of bacterial plasmid, which is a small, circular piece of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). During the purification process, the sample becomes a mixture of three different topological forms of this same plasmid, all of which have the same molecular weight.

In agarose gel electrophoresis, charged molecules migrate through a porous gel matrix under the influence of an electric field. The migration speed is primarily dependent on the molecule's conformation (shape and compactness), as this determines how easily it can navigate the pores of the gel. All three plasmid forms carry the same net negative charge per unit length.\n\nPredict the relative order of migration for these three forms, from the one that travels the farthest through the gel (fastest) to the one that travels the shortest distance (slowest).\n\nA.

In a porous agarose gel, the frictional coefficient $f$ increases with effective hydrodynamic size and susceptibility to pore entanglement; more compact conformations have smaller $f$.
