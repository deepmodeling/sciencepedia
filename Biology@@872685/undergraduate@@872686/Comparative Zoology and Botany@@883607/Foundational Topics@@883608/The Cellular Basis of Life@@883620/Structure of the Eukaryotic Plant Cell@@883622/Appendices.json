Unlike nuclear genes, organelles like chloroplasts and mitochondria contain their own genetic material and typically follow a non-Mendelian, maternal pattern of inheritance. This exercise [@problem_id:1776497] uses a classic reciprocal cross, a powerful experimental design in genetics, to explore the consequences of this uniparental inheritance on the phenotype of the next generation.", "problem": "In a controlled breeding experiment, a botanist uses two distinct, true-breeding varieties of a flowering plant. The first variety, designated \"Veridian,\" is fully green due to its cells containing normal, photosynthetically active chloroplasts. The second variety, designated \"Albus,\" is entirely white (albino) because its cells contain plastids with a genetic mutation that prevents the synthesis of chlorophyll, rendering them non-functional for photosynthesis.\n\nThe botanist performs two reciprocal crosses:\n\nCross 1: A Veridian plant is used as the female parent (ovule donor) and is pollinated by an Albus plant (pollen donor).\nCross 2: An Albus plant is used as the female parent (ovule donor) and is pollinated by a Veridian plant (pollen donor).\n\nAssuming the typical mode of plastid inheritance observed in the vast majority of angiosperms, predict the phenotype of the F1 generation seedlings that will grow from the seeds produced by these two crosses.\n\nA.

The problem specifies the typical plastid inheritance in angiosperms, which is uniparental maternal inheritance: the embryo’s plastids are derived from the egg cytoplasm; pollen typically does not contribute plastids to the zygote. Therefore, the plastid genotype of the F1 seedlings is determined by the female parent’s plastids.\n\nLet $C^{+}$ denote functional plastids (green phenotype) and $C^{-}$ denote mutant plastids (albino phenotype). True-breeding indicates homoplasmy in each line: Veridian is $C^{+}$ only and Albus is $C^{-}$ only. Under strict maternal inheritance of plastids:\n- In Cross 1 (Veridian female $\\times$ Albus male), the egg provides $C^{+}$ plastids, and the pollen contributes no plastids. Thus, all embryos inherit $C^{+}$ plastids and express the green phenotype.\n- In Cross 2 (Albus female $\\times$ Veridian male), the egg provides $C^{-}$ plastids, and the pollen contributes no plastids. Thus, all embryos inherit $C^{-}$ plastids and express the albino phenotype.\n\nVariegation would require heteroplasmy in the maternal plant (a mixture of $C^{+}$ and $C^{-}$ plastids) and subsequent sorting, but the problem states both parental lines are true-breeding, implying homoplasmy, so variegation is not expected.\n\nTherefore, all seedlings from Cross 1 will be green, and all seedlings from Cross 2 will be albino, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1776497"}, {"introduction": "The final shape of a plant cell is not accidental; it is a highly controlled process directed by an internal scaffold, the cytoskeleton.

Let the volume of the cell at the end of this normal growth phase be $V_{aniso}$.\n\nNow, consider a scenario where the developing cell is treated with a novel herbicide. This herbicide's sole mechanism of action is to prevent the polymerization of cortical microtubules, leading to a loss of directional guidance for cellulose microfibril deposition.
