{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "One of the most compelling pieces of evidence for the endosymbiotic theory lies in the \"fossils\" found within modern organelles. Mitochondria and chloroplasts retain features of their free-living prokaryotic ancestors, including their own distinct ribosomes. This exercise uses a thought experiment involving a hypothetical drug to test your understanding of this crucial difference between organellar (70S) and eukaryotic cytoplasmic (80S) ribosomes, a distinction that forms a foundational argument for the theory [@problem_id:1781078].", "problem": "In a cell biology research laboratory, a new experimental drug called Ribostatin-70 is being tested. This drug is known to be a highly specific inhibitor of the peptidyl transferase center of 70S ribosomes, effectively halting protein synthesis by these ribosomes. The drug can freely pass through the plasma membrane and the double membranes of organelles, but it cannot cross the nuclear envelope. Consider an *in vitro* experiment where two separate cultures of healthy, metabolically active cells are treated with a sufficient concentration of Ribostatin-70: one culture contains typical mammalian somatic cells (animal cells) and the other contains photosynthetic leaf mesophyll cells (plant cells).\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary, differential effects of Ribostatin-70 on these two cell types?\n\nA. Neither cell type will be affected, as both are eukaryotic and primarily utilize 80S ribosomes for protein synthesis.\n\nB. Protein synthesis in the cytoplasm will be halted in both cell types, but the plant cell will be more resilient due to its ability to photosynthesize.\n\nC. Only the plant cell will be affected, leading to a shutdown of photosynthesis due to the inhibition of chloroplast function.\n\nD. In the animal cell, mitochondrial protein synthesis will be inhibited. In the plant cell, protein synthesis within both mitochondria and chloroplasts will be inhibited.\n\nE. The animal cell's energy production will be halted, while the plant cell will be unaffected as it can rely entirely on photosynthesis, a process localized in the cytoplasm.", "solution": "The drug Ribostatin-70 is specified to be a highly specific inhibitor of the peptidyl transferase center of 70S ribosomes. The peptidyl transferase center resides in the large rRNA of the ribosome and catalyzes peptide bond formation during translation. Therefore, inhibiting it will block protein synthesis only in ribosomes of the 70S type.\n\nIn eukaryotic cells:\n1) Cytosolic ribosomes are 80S, not 70S. Thus, cytoplasmic protein synthesis will not be directly inhibited by a 70S-specific drug.\n2) Mitochondria contain bacterial-type 70S ribosomes. Therefore, mitochondrial protein synthesis will be inhibited.\n3) In plant cells, chloroplasts also contain 70S ribosomes. Therefore, chloroplast protein synthesis will be inhibited in addition to mitochondrial protein synthesis.\n\nMembrane permeability considerations given in the problem:\n- The drug can cross the plasma membrane and the double membranes of organelles, so it will reach mitochondria and, in plant cells, chloroplasts. Hence, it can access mitochondrial and chloroplast ribosomes.\n- The drug cannot cross the nuclear envelope, but this does not affect the conclusion because translation does not occur in the nucleus. The nuclear restriction does not protect mitochondria or chloroplasts.\n\nConsequences by cell type:\n- Animal (mammalian somatic) cell: Only mitochondria possess 70S ribosomes. Thus, mitochondrial translation will be inhibited, impairing synthesis of mitochondrially encoded components of the oxidative phosphorylation system.\n- Plant (photosynthetic mesophyll) cell: Both mitochondria and chloroplasts possess 70S ribosomes. Thus, translation will be inhibited in both organelles, impairing mitochondrial function and chloroplast function (including photosynthetic complexes with chloroplast-encoded subunits).\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Incorrect. Although cytosolic ribosomes are 80S, organelles have 70S ribosomes that will be inhibited.\n- B: Incorrect. Cytoplasmic translation will not be halted by a 70S-specific inhibitor, and plant resilience via photosynthesis is undermined because chloroplast translation is inhibited.\n- C: Incorrect. The animal cell is also affected via mitochondrial 70S ribosomes; additionally, in plants the effect is not limited to photosynthesis alone since mitochondria are also affected.\n- D: Correct. Animal cells lose mitochondrial protein synthesis; plant cells lose both mitochondrial and chloroplast protein synthesis.\n- E: Incorrect. Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts, not in the cytoplasm, and plant cells are affected at both mitochondria and chloroplasts.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that mitochondrial translation is inhibited in animal cells, and both mitochondrial and chloroplast translation are inhibited in plant cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1781078"}, {"introduction": "A robust scientific theory does more than just explain past observations; it makes specific, falsifiable predictions about what we should find in the future. The canonical endosymbiotic model predicts that an engulfed prokaryote would result in an organelle with a double membrane. This problem challenges you to think critically about this prediction by considering a hypothetical discovery where an organelle has prokaryotic-like genetics but a single membrane, forcing you to evaluate which pieces of evidence are most critical to the theory [@problem_id:1781075].", "problem": "The canonical endosymbiotic theory proposes a specific mechanism for the origin of certain eukaryotic organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts. This theory posits that a large ancestral host cell engulfed a smaller, free-living prokaryote. Instead of being digested, the prokaryote established a symbiotic relationship, eventually evolving into an organelle. Key predictions of this model include: (1) The resulting organelle should be enclosed by a double membrane—one derived from the prokaryote's original plasma membrane and a second derived from the host cell's vacuole membrane formed during engulfment. (2) The organelle should possess its own genetic material, typically a single circular chromosome of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), similar to that of prokaryotes.\n\nImagine that a team of astrobiologists studying a newly discovered single-celled eukaryote-like organism from an extraterrestrial environment identifies a novel, energy-producing organelle within its cytoplasm. Further analysis reveals that this organelle contains its own small, circular DNA molecule and ribosomes that resemble those of prokaryotes. However, detailed imaging shows the organelle is consistently enclosed by only a single membrane.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate explanation for how this specific finding challenges the canonical endosymbiotic theory as the origin for *this particular organelle*?\n\nA. The presence of a single membrane is inconsistent with the engulfment (phagocytosis) mechanism, which predicts a double membrane.\n\nB. The discovery of prokaryote-like ribosomes within the organelle is a direct contradiction to the endosymbiotic theory.\n\nC. The fact that the organelle possesses its own circular DNA molecule is contrary to the predictions for an organelle of endosymbiotic origin.\n\nD. A single membrane suggests the organelle evolved through secondary endosymbiosis, where a eukaryotic cell engulfs another eukaryotic cell.\n\nE. The finding supports the hypothesis that the organelle originated from an invagination of the host cell's own plasma membrane, which later pinched off.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the canonical endosymbiotic theory’s mechanistic prediction for organelles derived from the engulfment of a free-living prokaryote via phagocytosis. The key expectations are:\n- The organelle should have its own genome, typically a single circular DNA molecule, reflecting its prokaryotic ancestry.\n- The organelle should contain prokaryote-like ribosomes, also reflecting its prokaryotic origin.\n- Critically, the organelle should be surrounded by two membranes. The inner membrane is derived from the original prokaryote’s plasma membrane, while the outer membrane is derived from the host’s phagocytic vacuole membrane formed during engulfment.\n\nIn the extraterrestrial organism, the organelle has its own small circular DNA and prokaryote-like ribosomes; both observations are congruent with an endosymbiotic origin and therefore do not challenge the theory. However, the observation that the organelle is consistently enclosed by only a single membrane directly conflicts with the double-membrane expectation that follows from the phagocytic engulfment mechanism.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n- Option A states that a single membrane is inconsistent with a phagocytosis-based origin, which predicts a double membrane. This directly identifies the specific contradiction and is therefore accurate.\n- Option B claims prokaryote-like ribosomes contradict endosymbiosis; this is incorrect because such ribosomes are predicted by the theory.\n- Option C claims circular DNA contradicts endosymbiosis; this is likewise incorrect because circular DNA is a predicted feature.\n- Option D asserts that a single membrane suggests secondary endosymbiosis. Secondary endosymbiosis typically yields organelles with more than two membranes (commonly three or four), not a single membrane, so this is inaccurate and does not resolve the inconsistency.\n- Option E proposes an alternative mechanism (invagination and pinching off of the host plasma membrane) that could explain a single membrane. While this is a plausible alternative hypothesis, the question asks which statement most accurately explains how the single-membrane finding challenges the canonical endosymbiotic theory for this organelle. The most direct challenge is the failure of the double-membrane prediction, as stated in Option A.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation for how the observation challenges the canonical endosymbiotic origin is that a single membrane conflicts with the double-membrane outcome expected from phagocytic engulfment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1781075"}, {"introduction": "While the endosymbiotic origins of mitochondria and chloroplasts are well-established, the evolutionary history of other organelles can be more ambiguous. The peroxisome is a perfect example of a real-world scientific puzzle where multiple lines of evidence must be weighed to distinguish between competing hypotheses. This practice problem simulates the work of an evolutionary cell biologist, requiring you to analyze a set of experimental findings and decide which hypothesis—endosymbiotic origin or endomembrane origin—is better supported by the data [@problem_id:1781064].", "problem": "The evolutionary origin of the peroxisome, a single-membrane-bound organelle found in virtually all eukaryotic cells, is a subject of ongoing scientific debate. Two primary hypotheses have been proposed:\n\n1.  **The Endosymbiotic Hypothesis**: This posits that the peroxisome is a relic of an ancient prokaryotic endosymbiont that, over evolutionary time, lost its autonomy and genome, with its genes being transferred to the host nucleus. Its existence would be analogous to that of mitochondria and chloroplasts, albeit far more reduced.\n2.  **The Endomembrane Origin Hypothesis**: This proposes that the peroxisome is not of foreign origin but arose from the cell's own endomembrane system, specifically budding off from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER).\n\nConsider the following set of established experimental observations regarding peroxisome biology:\n\n(I) Peroxisomes contain no genetic material (neither DNA nor RNA) and no ribosomes. All of their constituent proteins are encoded by nuclear genes.\n\n(II) Peroxisomes can proliferate through the growth and subsequent fission of pre-existing peroxisomes, a process morphologically similar to mitochondrial and bacterial division.\n\n(III) Modern cell-labeling and trafficking studies show that a class of peroxisomal membrane proteins are first inserted into the Endoplasmic Reticulum, which then buds off vesicles that can mature into or fuse with existing peroxisomes.\n\n(IV) The vast majority of peroxisomal proteins (matrix proteins) are synthesized on free ribosomes in the cytosol and imported post-translationally into the organelle. This import mechanism is distinct from both the co-translational import into the ER and the import mechanisms of mitochondria.\n\n(V) The metabolic pathways within peroxisomes, such as the breakdown of very long-chain fatty acids and detoxification of reactive oxygen species, are deeply integrated with metabolic activities in the cytosol and mitochondria.\n\nWhich pair of observations, taken together, provides the most direct and compelling evidence in support of the Endomembrane Origin Hypothesis for peroxisomes?\n\nA. I and II\n\nB. II and IV\n\nC. I and III\n\nD. IV and V\n\nE. III and V", "solution": "We are asked to identify which pair of observations most directly supports the Endomembrane Origin Hypothesis for peroxisomes, which posits that peroxisomes arise from the host cell’s endomembrane system, specifically via the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), rather than from an engulfed endosymbiont.\n\nLogical evaluation of each observation with respect to the two hypotheses proceeds as follows:\n\n1. Observation (I) states that peroxisomes contain no genetic material and no ribosomes, and all peroxisomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes. This is consistent with an endomembrane origin because endomembrane-derived organelles typically rely entirely on nuclear genes and do not contain their own genomes or ribosomes. In contrast, the classic endosymbiotic organelles (mitochondria and chloroplasts) retain their own genomes and translation machinery. While it is theoretically possible for an endosymbiont to lose its genome entirely over evolution, the complete absence of genetic material and ribosomes removes a key hallmark of an endosymbiotic origin and therefore weakens that hypothesis relative to an ER-derived one. Thus, (I) supports the endomembrane origin by negating a central endosymbiotic feature.\n\n2. Observation (II) notes that peroxisomes proliferate by growth and fission of pre-existing peroxisomes, morphologically similar to mitochondrial and bacterial division. This resemblance could be interpreted as supportive of an endosymbiotic-like property, or as a convergent cellular mechanism for organelle maintenance. It does not specifically implicate the ER and therefore does not directly support the endomembrane origin; if anything, it could be seen as consistent with endosymbiotic behavior.\n\n3. Observation (III) demonstrates that a class of peroxisomal membrane proteins are first inserted into the ER, followed by ER-derived vesicle budding that matures into or fuses with peroxisomes. This is direct evidence of peroxisome biogenesis from the ER, a defining prediction of the endomembrane hypothesis. In contrast, organelles of endosymbiotic origin do not insert their membrane proteins into the ER for organelle biogenesis; rather, their membrane proteins are generally synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes and imported via organelle-specific translocases.\n\n4. Observation (IV) indicates that most peroxisomal matrix proteins are synthesized on free cytosolic ribosomes and imported post-translationally via a mechanism distinct from both ER co-translational import and mitochondrial import. While this highlights a unique import pathway, post-translational import from free ribosomes is not diagnostic of ER origin, since mitochondria also import many proteins post-translationally from the cytosol. Thus, (IV) does not specifically support endomembrane origin.\n\n5. Observation (V) states that peroxisomal metabolism is integrated with cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolism. Such integration is common for many organelles regardless of origin and is not diagnostic of the endomembrane hypothesis.\n\nFrom this analysis, the observation that most directly supports the endomembrane origin is (III). The strongest companion observation that further undermines the endosymbiotic hypothesis and thus bolsters the endomembrane case is (I), because the complete absence of nucleic acids and ribosomes is unlike known endosymbiotic organelles. Other pairings either include observations that are neutral or potentially consistent with endosymbiosis (e.g., II), or are nonspecific (IV, V).\n\nTherefore, the most direct and compelling pair in support of the Endomembrane Origin Hypothesis is observations (I) and (III), corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1781064"}]}
