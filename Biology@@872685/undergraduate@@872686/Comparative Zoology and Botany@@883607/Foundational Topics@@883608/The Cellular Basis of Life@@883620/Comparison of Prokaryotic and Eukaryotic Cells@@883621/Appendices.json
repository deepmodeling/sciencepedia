Through a series of biochemical and microscopic analyses, the following observations are made about their processes for cellular respiration:\n\n- **Organism A:** The complete breakdown of glucose to generate Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) involves glycolysis occurring in the cytoplasm, followed by subsequent reactions of the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain that are carried out within the cytoplasm and at the inner surface of the cell membrane, respectively.\n- **Organism B:** Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm, but the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation are localized within specialized, double-membrane-bound organelles distributed throughout the cell's cytoplasm.\n\nBased on these fundamental differences in cellular organization and metabolic processes, correctly identify the cell type for each organism.\n\nA.

Both Organism A and Organism B are eukaryotes.", "solution": "Principle 1: Prokaryotic cells lack membrane-bound organelles (including mitochondria). Consequently, glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm, the Krebs cycle enzymes are cytosolic or associated with the inner surface of the plasma membrane, and the electron transport chain resides in the plasma membrane. Thus, oxidative phosphorylation uses the proton motive force across the plasma membrane.\n\nPrinciple 2: Eukaryotic cells possess mitochondria, which are double-membrane-bound organelles. In eukaryotes, glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm, the Krebs cycle occurs in the mitochondrial matrix, and the electron transport chain with ATP synthase (oxidative phosphorylation) is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n\nApplication to Organism A: The description states that glycolysis is in the cytoplasm, with subsequent Krebs cycle reactions in the cytoplasm and the electron transport chain at the inner surface of the cell membrane. This matches the organization of prokaryotes (no mitochondria; ETC on plasma membrane).\n\nApplication to Organism B: The description states that glycolysis is in the cytoplasm, but the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation occur inside specialized, double-membrane-bound organelles. This identifies mitochondria and therefore indicates a eukaryotic cell.\n\nConclusion: Organism A is a prokaryote; Organism B is a eukaryote.

This exercise focuses on the fate of messenger RNA (mRNA) after it is transcribed from DNA. By recognizing the hallmark modifications unique to eukaryotic mRNA, you can not only identify the cell type but also appreciate the sophisticated mechanisms that protect and regulate gene expression in complex cells [@problem_id:2288119].", "problem": "An astrobiologist studying samples from a subterranean ocean on a distant moon isolates a novel, single-celled microorganism. Subsequent molecular analysis reveals that after transcribing a gene into a primary RNA transcript, the organism's cellular machinery modifies the transcript before protein synthesis. Specifically, a 7-methylguanosine residue is added to the 5' end, and a long sequence of approximately 200 adenosine monophosphates is added to the 3' end. These fully processed messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules are then used as templates for translation.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements correctly classifies the microorganism and describes the primary purposes of these modifications?\n\nA. The organism is eukaryotic; the modifications protect the mRNA from enzymatic degradation, facilitate its export from the nucleus, and promote efficient initiation of translation.\n\nB. The organism is prokaryotic; the modifications are used to signal the precise start of transcription and to anchor the mRNA to the cell membrane for localized protein synthesis.\n\nC. The organism is eukaryotic; the 5' modification's main role is to signal the termination of transcription, while the 3' modification is essential for the cell to correctly splice out introns.\n\nD. The organism is prokaryotic; the modifications stabilize the mRNA in the harsh extracellular environment and act as a binding site for ribosomes.\n\nE. The organism is eukaryotic; the sole purpose of the modifications is to increase the catalytic activity of the mRNA, allowing it to function as a ribozyme.", "solution": "The described RNA processing events are (i) addition of a $7$-methylguanosine cap to the $5^{\\prime}$ end (the $m^{7}G$ cap) and (ii) addition of a polyadenosine tail of approximately $200$ adenosine monophosphates to the $3^{\\prime}$ end (poly(A) tail). These are hallmark features of eukaryotic messenger RNA processing that occur co- and post-transcriptionally in the nucleus. Prokaryotes generally do not add an $m^{7}G$ cap and do not typically add long stabilizing poly(A) tails; when polyadenylation occurs in bacteria, it is short and often marks RNAs for degradation rather than stabilization. Therefore, the organism is eukaryotic.\n\nThe primary purposes of these modifications are as follows:\n- Protection from enzymatic degradation: the $5^{\\prime}$ $m^{7}G$ cap protects against $5^{\\prime}\\to 3^{\\prime}$ exonucleases and the poly(A) tail, bound by poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs), protects against $3^{\\prime}\\to 5^{\\prime}$ exonucleases; shortening of the tail (deadenylation) and decapping are key steps in mRNA decay.\n- Facilitation of nuclear export: the cap-binding complex and proteins associated with the poly(A) tail contribute to recruitment of nuclear export factors, promoting transport of the processed mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.\n- Promotion of efficient translation initiation: the cap is recognized by the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E (as part of eIF4F), and PABP bound to the poly(A) tail interacts with eIF4G, promoting mRNA circularization and efficient ribosome recruitment.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A correctly identifies the organism as eukaryotic and lists the primary purposes: protection from degradation, facilitation of nuclear export, and efficient translation initiation.\n- B is incorrect because prokaryotes do not use an $m^{7}G$ cap or long stabilizing poly(A) tails, and start of transcription is determined by DNA promoter elements, not RNA modifications; anchoring mRNA to membranes is not a general function of these modifications.\n- C is incorrect because the $5^{\\prime}$ cap does not signal transcription termination, and while $3^{\\prime}$ end processing is coupled to transcription termination and can influence splicing, the poly(A) tail itself is not primarily essential for intron splicing.\n- D is incorrect because prokaryotes do not use these modifications for extracellular stabilization or ribosome binding; bacterial translation initiation relies on the Shine–Dalgarno sequence, not a cap or poly(A) tail.\n- E is incorrect because the modifications do not primarily exist to confer catalytic (ribozyme) activity; most mRNAs are not catalytic and their modifications serve stability, export, and translation functions.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2288119"}, {"introduction": "Why are eukaryotic cells so much more structurally complex than prokaryotic cells? This practice explores the fundamental physical constraints that answer this question, using a quantitative approach. By calculating and comparing diffusion times within a small prokaryote and a much larger eukaryote, you will uncover the physical limitations of passive transport and understand why the evolution of active transport systems was essential for the emergence of large, complex cells [@problem_id:2288081].", "problem": "To understand the physical constraints that shape cellular architecture, consider the process of passive diffusion within a cell. We will model a typical prokaryotic cell and a typical eukaryotic cell as simple spheres. The prokaryotic cell has a diameter of $1.0\\ \\mu\\text{m}$, while the eukaryotic cell has a diameter of $20\\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nA small molecule, such as glucose, must travel from the cell membrane to various locations within the cell to be utilized. The characteristic time for a molecule to diffuse across a certain distance is a key factor in the efficiency of cellular processes. Assume the cytoplasm in both cells has a consistency such that the diffusion coefficient for this small molecule is $D = 5.0 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}$.\n\nCalculate the approximate time it would take for the molecule to diffuse from the cell periphery (membrane) to the cell's geometric center for both the prokaryote and the eukaryote. Based on your calculations, select the option below that presents the correct approximate times and the most accurate biological conclusion. For the purposes of this problem, the time values presented in the options have been rounded to two significant figures.\n\nA. Prokaryote: $2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{s}$; Eukaryote: $1.0\\ \\text{s}$. The substantial increase in diffusion time for the eukaryote suggests that passive diffusion is too slow to support the metabolic needs of a large cell, necessitating the evolution of active intracellular transport systems.\n\nB. Prokaryote: $2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{s}$; Eukaryote: $0.050\\ \\text{s}$. The diffusion time scales linearly with cell radius, so the 20-fold increase in radius leads to a 20-fold increase in time, a manageable difference that does not require specialized transport.\n\nC. Prokaryote: $5.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{s}$; Eukaryote: $0.20\\ \\text{s}$. The much longer diffusion time in eukaryotes is primarily due to their more structured and dense cytoplasm, which increases the effective diffusion distance.\n\nD. Prokaryote: $1.0\\ \\text{s}$; Eukaryote: $2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{s}$. The faster diffusion in eukaryotes demonstrates that their complex endomembrane system creates efficient channels for molecular transport, making them superior to prokaryotes.\n\nE.

Moreover, diffusion time scales as $t \\propto L^{2}$, so the 20-fold increase in radius from prokaryote to eukaryote yields roughly a 400-fold increase in diffusion time (from milliseconds to about one second), indicating that passive diffusion becomes limiting over eukaryotic length scales and supporting the biological conclusion that active intracellular transport systems are necessary in larger cells.
