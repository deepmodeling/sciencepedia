{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The separation of the genome within the nucleus is a hallmark of eukaryotic cells, but this compartmentalization necessitates a highly regulated system for molecular traffic. Proteins required in the nucleus, such as histones, are synthesized in the cytoplasm and must be actively imported. This exercise [@problem_id:1776200] presents a hypothetical scenario to test your understanding of this fundamental process, asking you to predict the immediate cellular consequence of a complete blockade of the nuclear pore complexes, the gatekeepers of the nucleus.", "problem": "A novel experimental drug, \"Poriblok,\" is being tested for its effects on eukaryotic animal cells. The drug's mechanism of action is to selectively and completely bind to and inhibit all functions of the Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs), the protein channels that span the nuclear envelope. Histones are a family of basic proteins that associate with Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) in the nucleus to form chromatin, which is crucial for DNA compaction. As with most cellular proteins, the synthesis of histones via translation occurs on ribosomes in the cytoplasm.\n\nAssuming a cell is treated with an effective dose of Poriblok, which of the following describes the most immediate and direct consequence for the population of newly synthesized histone proteins?\n\nA. Their synthesis on ribosomes will be immediately halted.\n\nB. They will be unable to enter the nucleus and will accumulate in the cytoplasm.\n\nC. They will enter the nucleus but will be unable to bind to DNA.\n\nD. They will accumulate within the nucleolus.\n\nE. They will be rapidly degraded by proteasomes in the nucleus.", "solution": "The nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) mediate all macromolecular traffic between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, including import of nuclear proteins bearing nuclear localization signals via importin/karyopherin pathways. Histones are synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes and must be transported into the nucleus through NPCs to associate with DNA and form chromatin. If Poriblok completely inhibits all functions of NPCs, then nuclear import is blocked.\n\nEvaluate each option based on this principle:\n\nA. Cytoplasmic translation on ribosomes does not require NPC function; thus histone synthesis is not immediately halted by NPC inhibition. While NPC blockade will eventually impede export of newly transcribed mRNAs and ribosomal subunits, the immediate and direct effect on newly synthesized histones is not cessation of translation.\n\nB. Newly synthesized histones in the cytoplasm require NPC-mediated import to enter the nucleus. With NPCs inhibited, they cannot cross the nuclear envelope and will remain in, and accumulate within, the cytoplasm. This is the most immediate and direct consequence.\n\nC. NPC inhibition does not affect the intrinsic DNA-binding capacity of histones; rather, it prevents their nuclear entry.\n\nD. The nucleolus is inside the nucleus; with NPCs blocked, histones cannot reach the nucleolus.\n\nE. Newly synthesized histones will not reach the nucleus; therefore, they will not be degraded by nuclear proteasomes as an immediate consequence. Any degradation that occurs would more likely be cytoplasmic and is not the most direct immediate outcome.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that newly synthesized histone proteins will be unable to enter the nucleus and will accumulate in the cytoplasm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1776200"}, {"introduction": "Animal cells rarely exist in isolation; they assemble into complex tissues that must withstand various physical forces. This structural integrity is provided by specialized cell-cell junctions that anchor cells to one another. This problem [@problem_id:1776216] focuses on desmosomes, the \"spot welds\" of the cell, and challenges you to deduce the tissue-level consequences of their specific failure, thereby connecting molecular structure to mechanical function.", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the properties of a cultured sheet of simple columnar epithelial cells derived from the intestinal lining. These cells are interconnected by a standard junctional complex, including tight junctions, adherens junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions. They are also anchored to an underlying extracellular matrix via hemidesmosomes.\n\nThe biologist introduces a highly specific toxin that selectively and irreversibly cleaves the extracellular domains of the cadherin proteins desmoglein and desmocollin. This leads to the complete and simultaneous functional failure of all desmosomes within the epithelial sheet. All other types of cell junctions and cell components, including the cytoskeletal networks, remain intact and functional immediately after the toxin's action.\n\nWhich of the following describes the most immediate and significant structural consequence for this epithelial sheet?\n\nA. The tissue loses its resistance to mechanical stress, allowing individual cells to be pulled apart from one another.\n\nB. The paracellular pathway becomes fully permeable, leading to unregulated leakage of fluid across the epithelial sheet.\n\nC. The entire epithelial sheet detaches as a single, cohesive unit from the underlying extracellular matrix.\n\nD. The coordinated contractility of the cell sheet is lost due to the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton network between cells.\n\nE. The passage of ions and small signaling molecules between the cytoplasm of adjacent cells is blocked.", "solution": "- The epithelial sheet contains multiple junction types with distinct functions:\n  - Tight junctions (claudins, occludins) seal the paracellular pathway and control permeability.\n  - Adherens junctions (classical cadherins such as E-cadherin linked to actin) coordinate actomyosin-based contractility and provide adhesive belts.\n  - Desmosomes (desmoglein and desmocollin cadherins linking to intermediate filaments via plakoglobin and desmoplakin) provide strong spot adhesions that confer resistance to mechanical stress by coupling keratin intermediate filament networks between neighboring cells.\n  - Gap junctions (connexins) allow passage of ions and small molecules between cytoplasms of adjacent cells.\n  - Hemidesmosomes (integrins such as $\\alpha6\\beta4$, BP antigens) anchor cells to the basal lamina/extracellular matrix.\n- The toxin selectively and irreversibly cleaves the extracellular domains of desmoglein and desmocollin. Cadherin-mediated adhesion requires extracellular domain trans-interactions between cadherins on adjacent cells. Cleavage abolishes these interactions, causing complete functional failure of desmosomes while all other junctions remain intact.\n- Immediate structural consequence of desmosome failure:\n  - Loss of the desmosomal cadherin linkages uncouples the intermediate filament networks across cells, removing the principal intercellular structures that distribute and resist mechanical shear and tensile forces.\n  - This produces a marked reduction in tissue mechanical integrity and cohesion under stress, predisposing to cells being pulled apart from one another (acantholysis), as seen in conditions targeting desmogleins.\n- Exclusion of other options given intact other junctions:\n  - Tight junctions are intact; therefore paracellular permeability is not rendered fully permeable (rules out B).\n  - Hemidesmosomes are intact; the sheet will not detach from the extracellular matrix as a unit (rules out C).\n  - Adherens junctions and actin networks are intact; coordinated actomyosin contractility is preserved (rules out D).\n  - Gap junctions are intact; intercellular ion/small molecule passage is not blocked (rules out E).\n- Therefore, the most immediate and significant structural consequence is loss of resistance to mechanical stress allowing cells to be pulled apart from one another.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1776216"}, {"introduction": "Much of our knowledge in cell biology comes not from simple observation, but from clever experiments designed to test competing hypotheses. The mechanism of protein transport through the Golgi apparatus was long debated, with two major models proposed. This practice [@problem_id:1776201] places you in the role of an investigator, asking you to analyze the results of a classic pulse-chase experiment and determine which observation provides definitive support for the Cisternal Maturation Model, sharpening your skills in experimental interpretation.", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the mechanism of protein transport through the Golgi apparatus in a eukaryotic animal cell line. Two dominant models exist: the Vesicular Transport Model, which proposes that Golgi cisternae are static and cargo moves between them in vesicles, and the Cisternal Maturation Model, which proposes that the cisternae themselves mature and progress from the cis- to the trans-face, carrying the cargo within them.\n\nTo distinguish between these models, the researcher genetically engineers the cells to express two fluorescently-tagged proteins. The first is a temperature-sensitive variant of the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus G protein (VSV-G) fused to a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). This ts-VSV-G-GFP protein misfolds and is retained in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) at a restrictive temperature of 40°C but folds correctly and enters the secretory pathway at a permissive temperature of 32°C. The second is a resident medial-Golgi enzyme, mannosidase II, tagged with a red fluorescent protein.\n\nThe experimental procedure is as follows:\n1.  Cells are cultured at the restrictive temperature (40°C), causing the ts-VSV-G-GFP to accumulate uniformly throughout the ER.\n2.  Cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, is added to the culture medium to ensure that no new fluorescent proteins are made.\n3.  The cells are then shifted to the permissive temperature (32°C), releasing a synchronized \"pulse\" of ts-VSV-G-GFP from the ER, which then traffics into the Golgi apparatus.\n4.  The movement of the green cargo protein (ts-VSV-G-GFP) and the location of the red resident enzyme are observed using live-cell fluorescence microscopy.\n\nWhich of the following observations would provide the strongest and most direct evidence in favor of the Cisternal Maturation Model?\n\nA. The green cargo appears in small transport vesicles that bud from a stationary cis-Golgi cisterna and fuse with the next stationary, red-labeled medial-Golgi cisterna.\n\nB. The green cargo is observed to remain within a single, distinct saccule that itself moves from the cis- towards the trans-position of the Golgi stack. This saccule is seen to transiently acquire the red-labeled medial-Golgi enzyme and later lose it as the saccule continues to progress.\n\nC. The red-labeled resident enzymes are observed to move in a forward (anterograde) direction through the Golgi stack, co-packaged with the green cargo in vesicles, and are eventually secreted from the cell.\n\nD. The green cargo is observed to enter the cis-Golgi and then immediately appears in retrograde transport vesicles moving back towards the Endoplasmic Reticulum, while the red-labeled cisternae remain stationary.\n\nE. Both the stationary Golgi cisternae and the transport vesicles moving between them are observed to simultaneously contain a stable mixture of both the green cargo protein and the red resident enzyme.", "solution": "First, state the mechanistic predictions of the two models. In the Vesicular Transport Model, Golgi cisternae are stationary, and anterograde cargo moves between them in transport vesicles, while resident enzymes remain in their respective cisternae and are not carried forward with cargo. In the Cisternal Maturation Model, a cisterna forms at the cis side and physically progresses toward the trans side while carrying cargo within it; the cisterna changes identity by transiently acquiring and then losing resident enzymes through continual retrograde vesicular trafficking of those resident enzymes.\n\nSecond, interpret the experimental design. The temperature-sensitive cargo accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum under restrictive conditions and, upon shift to permissive conditions with cycloheximide present, a synchronized cohort of pre-existing green cargo enters the Golgi. Because no new fluorescent proteins are synthesized, the experiment tracks the fate of the same cargo molecules and the existing red-labeled resident enzyme, allowing direct observation of whether cargo remains in a moving cisterna that changes enzyme composition (cisternal maturation) or moves between stationary cisternae in vesicles (vesicular transport).\n\nThird, derive the specific observational signatures each model predicts under these conditions.\n- Under the Vesicular Transport Model: cargo should appear in small vesicles budding from a stationary cis cisterna and fuse with the next stationary cisterna; resident enzymes should remain localized to their respective cisternae and not be carried forward with cargo, aside from their own retrograde recycling that keeps them in place.\n- Under the Cisternal Maturation Model: a single cargo-containing cisterna (a distinct saccule) should be seen to progress from cis to trans positions, while its composition of resident enzymes changes over time; specifically, it should transiently acquire the red medial-Golgi enzyme (mannosidase II) as it attains medial identity and later lose it as it matures further toward a trans identity. Resident enzymes themselves should primarily undergo retrograde trafficking to earlier cisternae, not anterograde co-packaging with cargo for secretion.\n\nFourth, evaluate each option against these predictions.\n- Option A describes cargo in small vesicles moving between stationary cisternae, precisely matching the Vesicular Transport Model, and therefore argues against cisternal maturation.\n- Option B describes the cargo remaining within a single, distinct saccule that migrates from cis to trans, with that saccule transiently acquiring and then losing the red medial-Golgi enzyme as it progresses. This is the hallmark prediction of the Cisternal Maturation Model: a maturing cisterna that changes its enzyme composition over time while carrying cargo forward.\n- Option C claims red resident enzymes move anterogradely with cargo and are secreted, which contradicts the defining feature of resident enzymes and the retrograde retrieval central to cisternal maturation; this does not support the model and is biologically implausible for resident Golgi enzymes.\n- Option D highlights retrograde movement of cargo back to the endoplasmic reticulum with stationary red cisternae, which neither demonstrates cisternal maturation nor the expected anterograde cargo flow in this pulse-chase setup.\n- Option E posits a stable mixture of cargo and resident enzymes in both cisternae and vesicles simultaneously, which does not show the time-dependent acquisition and loss of specific resident enzymes by a single moving cisterna; it lacks the diagnostic temporal signature of cisternal maturation.\n\nTherefore, the strongest and most direct evidence in favor of the Cisternal Maturation Model is the observation in Option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1776201"}]}
