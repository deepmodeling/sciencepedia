This set includes 38 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. In a male dog, the process of spermatogenesis occurs in the testes to produce sperm. This process begins with a diploid cell, a primary spermatocyte, which undergoes two successive meiotic divisions (Meiosis I and Meiosis II). The first meiotic division of a primary spermatocyte results in the formation of two secondary spermatocytes. Each of these secondary spermatocytes then proceeds to undergo the second meiotic division.\n\nConsidering this process, determine the number of chromosomes present in a single secondary spermatocyte of a male dog.\n\nA. 156\n\nB. 78\n\nC. 39\n\nD. 38\n\nE. 23", "solution": "The problem asks for the number of chromosomes in a secondary spermatocyte of a male dog, given that its somatic cells have 78 chromosomes.\n\nFirst, let's establish the ploidy level of the somatic cells. Somatic cells are diploid, meaning they contain two sets of chromosomes. The diploid number is denoted as $2n$. We are given that for a dog, $2n = 78$.\n\nThe process of spermatogenesis involves meiosis, which reduces the chromosome number by half to produce haploid gametes. The process starts with a diploid primary spermatocyte. Before meiosis begins, the cell's DNA replicates during the S phase of interphase. At this point, the primary spermatocyte still has a chromosome number of $2n=78$, but each chromosome consists of two identical sister chromatids.\n\nMeiosis I is the first meiotic division, and it is a reductional division. During Meiosis I, homologous chromosome pairs separate from each other and move to opposite poles of the cell. The primary spermatocyte ($2n$) divides to form two secondary spermatocytes. Because the homologous pairs have been separated, each resulting secondary spermatocyte is haploid, meaning it contains only one set of chromosomes. The chromosome number in a haploid cell is denoted as $n$.\n\nWe can calculate the haploid number ($n$) from the diploid number ($2n$):\n$$n = \\frac{2n}{2}$$\nGiven $2n = 78$, we find:\n$$n = \\frac{78}{2} = 39$$\n\nTherefore, a secondary spermatocyte contains 39 chromosomes. It is important to note that at this stage (after Meiosis I but before Meiosis II), each of these 39 chromosomes still consists of a pair of sister chromatids. The sister chromatids will separate during Meiosis II, resulting in spermatids that also have $n=39$ chromosomes, but each chromosome is now a single chromatid. However, the question specifically asks for the number of chromosomes in a secondary spermatocyte, which is the haploid number, $n$.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. 156: This would be the total number of chromatids in a primary spermatocyte after DNA replication ($78 \\text{ chromosomes} \\times 2 \\text{ chromatids/chromosome} = 156 \\text{ chromatids}$). This is incorrect.\nB. 78: This is the diploid number ($2n$), which is the number of chromosomes in a somatic cell or a primary spermatocyte. It is also the number of chromatids in a secondary spermatocyte ($39 \\text{ chromosomes} \\times 2 \\text{ chromatids/chromosome} = 78 \\text{ chromatids}$). This is incorrect as the question asks for the chromosome count.\nC. 39: This is the haploid number ($n$), which is the correct number of chromosomes in a secondary spermatocyte.\nD. 38: This represents the number of autosomes in a haploid set. A gamete or secondary spermatocyte contains 38 autosomes plus one sex chromosome (either X or Y), for a total of 39 chromosomes. This option incorrectly excludes the sex chromosome.\nE. 23: This is the haploid number of chromosomes for humans ($n=23$), not for dogs.\n\nThus, the correct number of chromosomes in a dog's secondary spermatocyte is 39.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1756277"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply counting chromosomes, a deeper understanding of meiosis involves tracking the total amount of DNA within the cell at each stage. This practice uses the concept of the C-value to quantify DNA content as a cell progresses through both meiotic divisions.

This plant is diploid. The amount of DNA in one of its haploid gametes (e.g., a mature pollen nucleus) is defined as having a value of C.

C, C\n\nE. 4C, C", "solution": "The problem asks for the DNA content at two key stages of meiosis, starting from a diploid cell in prophase I with a DNA content of 4C. The value C represents the amount of DNA in a single, unreplicated haploid set of chromosomes.\n\nThe initial cell is a diploid microspore mother cell. Before meiosis, it undergoes the S phase of interphase, where its DNA is replicated.\n- A G1 diploid cell has a chromosome number of 2n and a DNA content of 2C.\n- After DNA replication (S phase), the cell enters meiosis I. The chromosome number is still considered 2n (as the centromere count has not changed), but each chromosome now consists of two identical sister chromatids. This doubles the amount of DNA.\n- Therefore, the starting state in prophase I is a cell with 2n chromosomes (each replicated) and a DNA content of 4C.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the DNA content after Meiosis I and Cytokinesis I.**\nMeiosis I is characterized by the separation of homologous chromosomes. The parent cell (2n, 4C) divides into two daughter cells. Each daughter cell receives one chromosome from each homologous pair.\n- The key event is that homologous pairs separate, but sister chromatids remain attached.\n- As a result, each of the two daughter cells is now haploid (n) in terms of chromosome number.\n- Since each chromosome in these daughter cells still consists of two sister chromatids, the DNA content of each cell is half that of the original parent cell.\n- DNA content per cell after Meiosis I = (Total DNA at start) / 2 = 4C / 2 = 2C.\n\nSo, the DNA content of a single cell immediately after the first meiotic division is 2C.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the DNA content after Meiosis II and Cytokinesis II.**\nMeiosis II is analogous to mitosis. It involves the separation of sister chromatids. Each of the two cells produced from meiosis I (each being n, 2C) undergoes this second division.\n- In each cell, the chromosomes align at the metaphase plate, and the sister chromatids are pulled apart to opposite poles.\n- Each cell then divides, resulting in a total of four cells from the original parent cell.\n- Each of these final four cells (microspores) is haploid (n) and contains chromosomes consisting of a single chromatid.\n- The DNA content of each final cell is therefore half that of the cells entering meiosis II.\n- DNA content per cell after Meiosis II = (DNA content after Meiosis I) / 2 = 2C / 2 = C.\n\nSo, the DNA content of a single microspore after the second meiotic division is C.\n\nCombining the results, the DNA content is 2C after meiosis I and C after meiosis II.
