{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The establishment of the three-domain system represented a paradigm shift, moving classification away from purely structural observations toward an evolutionary framework based on molecular data. This exercise challenges the outdated concept of \"prokaryotes\" as a single, unified group. Understanding why this term is phylogenetically invalid is crucial for grasping the evolutionary relationships that form the very foundation of modern biology.", "problem": "Historically, life was often categorized based on observable structural characteristics. This led to the concept of \"prokaryotes\" (organisms lacking a membrane-bound nucleus, e.g., bacteria) and \"eukaryotes\" (organisms with a nucleus). In this framework, prokaryotes were grouped into a single kingdom, Monera. However, pioneering work in molecular phylogeny by Carl Woese in the 1970s, which utilized comparative sequencing of ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA), led to the establishment of the three-domain system: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. This new system fundamentally challenged the validity of \"prokaryote\" as a formal phylogenetic classification.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental reason why the taxon \"Prokaryota\" (comprising all bacteria and archaea) is considered phylogenetically invalid under the three-domain system?\n\nA. The lack of a nucleus is a primitive (plesiomorphic) characteristic and cannot be used to define a valid evolutionary group.\n\nB. The metabolic diversity found within Bacteria and Archaea is far too great to justify placing them in a single group.\n\nC. The grouping 'Prokaryota' is paraphyletic because molecular evidence shows that the domain Eukarya shares a more recent common ancestor with the domain Archaea than Archaea does with the domain Bacteria.\n\nD. The domains Bacteria and Archaea are polyphyletic, as they arose independently from different last universal common ancestors.\n\nE. The term 'prokaryote' is functionally useful for describing cell structure but is irrelevant to genetics, which is the sole basis for modern classification.", "solution": "Goal: Identify why the taxon Prokaryota (Bacteria + Archaea) is phylogenetically invalid under the three-domain system.\n\nPrinciple: In phylogenetic systematics, a valid higher taxon should be monophyletic, meaning it must include a common ancestor and all of its descendants. A paraphyletic group includes an ancestor but excludes one or more descendants; a polyphyletic group unites taxa without their most recent common ancestor.\n\nEmpirical basis: Carl Woese’s molecular phylogenies based on small-subunit rRNA revealed that the deepest split divides Bacteria from a clade comprising Archaea and Eukarya. This can be represented as the topology Bacteria as sister to the clade (Archaea + Eukarya). Consequently, the most recent common ancestor of Archaea and Eukarya is more recent than the most recent common ancestor of Archaea and Bacteria. Therefore, grouping Bacteria and Archaea together as Prokaryota excludes Eukarya, despite Eukarya sharing a more recent common ancestor with Archaea than Archaea does with Bacteria. This makes Prokaryota paraphyletic.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: While the lack of a nucleus is indeed a plesiomorphic character and plesiomorphies do not diagnose clades, the decisive phylogenetic reason under the three-domain system is specifically the paraphyly of Prokaryota, not merely the primitiveness of the character.\n- B: Metabolic diversity does not determine phylogenetic validity; it is irrelevant to whether a group is monophyletic.\n- C: Correct. It states the paraphyly and the key molecular finding: Eukarya shares a more recent common ancestor with Archaea than Archaea does with Bacteria, so Prokaryota excludes a descendant lineage and is thus invalid as a clade.\n- D: Incorrect. Bacteria and Archaea do not arise from different last universal common ancestors; there is a single LUCA in standard models.\n- E: Incorrect framing. Although the term prokaryote can be functionally useful, phylogenetic classification is based on evolutionary relationships inferred from multiple data sources, with molecular data being central, and the invalidity arises from paraphyly, not from supposed irrelevance to genetics.\n\nConclusion: The most accurate and fundamental reason is that Prokaryota is paraphyletic due to the Archaea + Eukarya relationship revealed by molecular phylogeny.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1782104"}, {"introduction": "Once the broad evolutionary tree of life is established, we can use specific molecular and cellular features as diagnostic markers to classify newly discovered organisms. This problem focuses on one such powerful clue: the proteins used for DNA packaging. By analyzing the presence and type of histone proteins, you can deduce the likely domain classification of a hypothetical microorganism, highlighting the deep molecular distinctions between Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.", "problem": "A team of scientists studying extremophiles discovers a novel, single-celled microorganism flourishing in the highly acidic, geothermal vents of a deep-sea hydrothermal field. Initial analysis of the organism's cellular machinery reveals a crucial detail about its genetic organization: its circular chromosome of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is compacted and organized by histone proteins, forming structures analogous to the nucleosomes found in more complex life forms.\n\nBased on the modern three-domain system of classification (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya), and this specific molecular finding, which of the following options most accurately identifies the domains into which this organism could plausibly be classified?\n\nA. Bacteria and Archaea\n\nB. Archaea and Eukarya\n\nC. Bacteria and Eukarya\n\nD. Only Eukarya\n\nE. The organism cannot be classified into any of the existing domains.", "solution": "1. In the three-domain system, diagnostic molecular features help distinguish Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.\n2. The key finding here is that the organism’s DNA is compacted by histone proteins into structures analogous to nucleosomes.\n3. Histone-based nucleosome organization is a defining feature of Eukarya and is also present in many Archaea (archaeal histones wrap DNA into nucleosome-like particles). Therefore, the presence of true histones organizing DNA into nucleosome-like structures is consistent with Archaea and Eukarya.\n4. In contrast, Bacteria typically lack true histones; they use histone-like proteins (e.g., HU, IHF) that do not form nucleosomes. Thus, this molecular finding excludes Bacteria.\n5. The circular chromosome detail aligns with Archaea (and Bacteria) and contrasts with the linear nuclear chromosomes of Eukarya; however, the question asks for the domains consistent with the specific molecular finding of histone-based nucleosome-like organization. On that basis, the domains that fit are Archaea and Eukarya.\n6. Therefore, among the provided options, the most accurate identification is Archaea and Eukarya.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1782132"}, {"introduction": "In scientific practice, a conclusion is strongest when supported by multiple, independent lines of evidence. This case study simulates the real-world process of classifying a novel microorganism isolated from an extreme environment. You will act as the lead investigator, integrating data from gene sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, biochemistry, and cell biology to make a definitive classification, demonstrating how a confluence of evidence leads to a robust scientific conclusion.", "problem": "A research team has isolated a novel, single-celled, extremophilic microorganism, designated strain V-24a, from a volcanic-ash-laden cryoconite hole on a glacier in Iceland. The environment is characterized by a low pH of 3.5 and fluctuating temperatures. To determine its evolutionary placement within the three-domain system of life, the team has performed a series of molecular and biochemical analyses. You are tasked with interpreting the following consolidated data to classify the organism.\n\n1.  **Gene Sequence Analysis**: The complete small subunit (SSU) ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene of V-24a was sequenced. The resulting sequence is 1792 base pairs long.\n\n2.  **Sequence Homology Search**: A Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) was used to compare the V-24a SSU rRNA sequence against a comprehensive database of known sequences. The top statistically significant alignments were:\n    *   Hit A: *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (a fungus) - 93% sequence identity.\n    *   Hit B: *Acanthamoeba castellanii* (an amoeba) - 91% sequence identity.\n    *   Hit C: *Sulfolobus acidocaldarius* (an archaeon) - 68% sequence identity.\n    *   Hit D: *Escherichia coli* (a bacterium) - 65% sequence identity.\n\n3.  **Phylogenetic Reconstruction**: A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method, incorporating the SSU rRNA sequence of V-24a along with sequences from a representative set of organisms from all three domains. The resulting tree topology shows that strain V-24a forms a monophyletic group with members of the class Lobosea. This entire group shares a more recent common ancestor with the Fungi/Metazoa group than with any member of the Archaea or Bacteria.\n\n4.  **Cellular and Biochemical Properties**:\n    *   Microscopic examination reveals the presence of a membrane-bound nucleus and mitochondria.\n    *   The cell membrane is composed of fatty acids linked to glycerol via ester bonds.\n    *   The organism's ribosomes are sensitive to the antibiotic cycloheximide, but are insensitive to chloramphenicol.\n\nBased on an integrated assessment of all the provided evidence, into which domain of life should strain V-24a be classified?\n\nA. Bacteria\n\nB. Archaea\n\nC. Eukarya\n\nD. A new, fourth domain of life, since its habitat is extreme but it possesses features of multiple domains.", "solution": "We aim to classify strain V-24a within the three-domain system (Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya) by integrating phylogenetic signal from SSU rRNA, cellular ultrastructure, membrane biochemistry, and antibiotic sensitivity. The guiding principles are: (i) SSU rRNA sequence identity and phylogenetic reconstruction reflect evolutionary relatedness; (ii) presence of a membrane-bound nucleus and mitochondria is diagnostic for Eukarya; (iii) lipid chemistry distinguishes Archaea (ether-linked isoprenoid chains) from Bacteria and Eukarya (ester-linked fatty acids); and (iv) differential antibiotic sensitivity distinguishes eukaryotic cytosolic ribosomes (sensitive to cycloheximide) from bacterial ribosomes (sensitive to chloramphenicol).\n\nFirst, the SSU rRNA gene length is 1792 base pairs. Eukaryotic SSU (18S rRNA) genes are typically around 1800 to 2100 base pairs, whereas bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes are commonly near 1500 base pairs. While length alone is not definitive, 1792 base pairs is consistent with a eukaryotic 18S rRNA and less consistent with typical bacterial or archaeal 16S lengths.\n\nSecond, the BLAST homology results show top hits to eukaryotes: Hit A (fungus) with identity 0.93, Hit B (amoeba) with identity 0.91, and substantially lower identities to an archaeon (Hit C, 0.68) and a bacterium (Hit D, 0.65). Under the principle that higher SSU rRNA sequence identity indicates closer phylogenetic relatedness, these values support placement within Eukarya rather than Archaea or Bacteria.\n\nThird, phylogenetic reconstruction by maximum likelihood places V-24a in a monophyletic group with members of Lobosea and shows this clade sharing a more recent common ancestor with the Fungi/Metazoa group than with any Archaea or Bacteria. As Lobosea are amoebozoan eukaryotes and the Fungi/Metazoa group is unequivocally eukaryotic, this tree topology directly supports assignment to Eukarya.\n\nFourth, cellular ultrastructure reveals a membrane-bound nucleus and mitochondria. By definition, Eukarya possess a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, whereas Bacteria and Archaea lack a nucleus. Therefore, these features are diagnostic for Eukarya and exclude Bacteria and Archaea.\n\nFifth, membrane lipid chemistry shows fatty acids linked to glycerol via ester bonds. Eukaryotes and bacteria characteristically have ester-linked fatty acid membranes, whereas Archaea characteristically have ether linkages to isoprenoid chains. The observed ester linkages therefore exclude Archaea and are fully consistent with Eukarya.\n\nSixth, antibiotic sensitivity patterns indicate that the organism’s ribosomes are sensitive to cycloheximide but insensitive to chloramphenicol. Cycloheximide inhibits eukaryotic cytosolic (80S) ribosomes, while chloramphenicol inhibits bacterial (70S) ribosomes. Sensitivity to cycloheximide and insensitivity to chloramphenicol thus identify the cytosolic translation machinery as eukaryotic, arguing against a bacterial or archaeal identity.\n\nFinally, the extremophilic habitat (acidic, temperature fluctuations in a glacial cryoconite hole) does not necessitate classification as Archaea or a new domain. Extremophily occurs across all domains, including Eukarya. Domain-level assignment must follow phylogeny and core cellular features, both of which unambiguously indicate Eukarya.\n\nIntegrating all lines of evidence—SSU rRNA length and identity patterns, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic placement with Lobosea and proximity to Fungi/Metazoa, presence of nucleus and mitochondria, ester-linked membrane lipids, and cycloheximide sensitivity with chloramphenicol insensitivity—the correct classification is Eukarya, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1782107"}]}
