{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A fundamental skill in comparative biology is \"tree-thinking\"—the ability to correctly interpret evolutionary relationships as depicted in a phylogenetic tree. This exercise challenges you to move beyond superficial similarities and apply the core principle of cladistics: evolutionary relatedness is determined exclusively by the recency of shared ancestry. By working through a textual description of vertebrate phylogeny, you will practice identifying the most recent common ancestors to determine which groups are the closest relatives [@problem_id:1769766].", "problem": "In modern biology, the evolutionary relationships between different groups of organisms are visualized using phylogenetic trees or cladograms. The branching patterns of these diagrams represent a hypothesis about the sequence of divergence events from common ancestors. The principle of cladistics states that two taxa are considered more closely related to each other than to a third taxon if they share a more recent common ancestor.\n\nConsider the following simplified textual description of the phylogeny of a subset of vertebrate animals:\n\nThe group known as bony vertebrates (Osteichthyes) is divided into two major lineages. The first lineage is the ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii), a group that includes the modern Salmon. The second lineage is the lobe-finned fishes (Sarcopterygii). The sarcopterygian lineage itself gave rise to the tetrapods, or four-limbed vertebrates. The earliest tetrapods eventually diverged into two principal groups: the amphibians and the amniotes. The amniotes, characterized by eggs adapted for life on land, subsequently split into two major clades. One clade, the synapsids, includes all mammals. The other clade, the sauropsids, further diversified. Within the sauropsids, a key divergence separated the lepidosaurs, which include the modern Lizard, from the archosaurs. This archosaur group is the ancestral lineage that includes both crocodilians and birds, such as the modern Sparrow.\n\nBased solely on this textual description of evolutionary relationships, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. The lizard is more closely related to the salmon than to the sparrow.\n\nB. The lizard is more closely related to the sparrow than to the salmon.\n\nC. The lizard is equally related to the salmon and the sparrow.\n\nD. The relationship cannot be determined from the information provided.", "solution": "We apply the cladistic principle: among three taxa, the pair that shares a more recent common ancestor is more closely related.\n\nFrom the description, the sequence of splits is:\n- Osteichthyes divides into Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes, including Salmon) and Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes).\n- Sarcopterygii gives rise to Tetrapods.\n- Tetrapods split into Amphibians and Amniotes.\n- Amniotes split into Synapsids (mammals) and Sauropsids.\n- Sauropsids split into Lepidosaurs (including Lizard) and Archosaurs (including birds such as Sparrow).\n\nLet $L$ denote Lizard (a lepidosaur within Sauropsida), $Sp$ denote Sparrow (an archosaur within Sauropsida), and $Sa$ denote Salmon (an actinopterygian).\n\n- The most recent common ancestor $\\operatorname{MRCA}(L,Sp)$ lies within Sauropsida, i.e., after the Amniote split and specifically at the Sauropsid node preceding the Lepidosaur–Archosaur divergence.\n- The most recent common ancestor $\\operatorname{MRCA}(L,Sa)$ lies at the base of Osteichthyes, at the split between Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii, because $L$ descends from Sarcopterygii via Tetrapods and $Sa$ is Actinopterygii.\n\nSince the Sauropsid node is a descendant of the Osteichthyan node along the lizard’s lineage, we have that $\\operatorname{MRCA}(L,Sp)$ is more recent than $\\operatorname{MRCA}(L,Sa)$. By the cladistic criterion, $L$ is more closely related to $Sp$ than to $Sa$.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the lizard is more closely related to the sparrow than to the salmon.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1769766"}, {"introduction": "Phylogenetic trees are hypotheses about evolutionary history that can be constructed from various forms of data, most powerfully from genetic sequences.
