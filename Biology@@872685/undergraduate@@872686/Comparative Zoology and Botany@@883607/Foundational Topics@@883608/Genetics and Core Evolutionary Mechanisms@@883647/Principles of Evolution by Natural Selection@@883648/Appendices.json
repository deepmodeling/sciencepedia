This first practice explores directional selection, a mode where environmental pressures favor individuals at one extreme of a trait's distribution. By analyzing a hypothetical scenario involving a plant and a new herbivore, you can develop an intuition for how selective pressures can systematically shift a population's average characteristics over generations [@problem_id:1770584].", "problem": "A population of a wind-pollinated plant, *Ventus perennis*, grows in a stable meadow ecosystem. In this population, the diameter of the flowers is a heritable trait and follows a normal distribution with a consistent mean and variance over many generations. An invasive species of beetle, *Flosvorax major*, is introduced to the meadow. This beetle feeds exclusively on the floral tissues of *V. perennis*. Due to their flight patterns and visual acuity, the beetles are significantly more successful at locating and consuming flowers with the largest diameters before these flowers can release their pollen. Conversely, flowers with smaller diameters are much less likely to be found and consumed by the beetles.\n\nAssuming the beetle population persists and continues to exert this selective pressure, and that there is sufficient genetic variation for flower size in the plant population, which of the following statements describes the most likely evolutionary consequence for the *V. perennis* population over many subsequent generations?\n\nA. Disruptive selection will occur, leading to a bimodal distribution where the most common phenotypes are very small flowers and very large flowers.\n\nB. There will be no evolutionary change in flower size, as the selective pressure is environmental, not genetic.\n\nC. Stabilizing selection will occur, leading to a decrease in the variation of flower size, with the average flower size remaining the same.\n\nD. Directional selection will occur, leading to an increase in the average flower diameter in the population.\n\nE. Directional selection will occur, leading to a decrease in the average flower diameter in the population.\n\nF. The plant population will face immediate extinction because all individuals will be consumed by the beetles.", "solution": "Let the flower diameter be the quantitative trait $z$ with initial mean $\\bar{z}$ and a normal distribution. The trait is heritable, so there is nonzero additive genetic variance $V_{A}$ and heritability $h^{2} \\in (0,1]$.\n\nThe invasive beetle preferentially consumes large flowers before pollen release, reducing fitness as $z$ increases. Let $p(z)$ denote the probability a flower is consumed before reproducing, with $\\frac{dp}{dz} > 0$. Let $w_{0}$ be the baseline fitness absent beetles. Then the realized fitness is\n$$\nw(z) = w_{0}\\bigl(1 - p(z)\\bigr),\n$$\nand since $\\frac{dp}{dz} > 0$, it follows that $\\frac{dw}{dz} = -w_{0}\\frac{dp}{dz} < 0$. Thus fitness is a monotonically decreasing function of $z$.\n\nFor a continuous trait with density $f(z)$, the mean after selection is\n$$\n\\bar{z}_{\\text{sel}} = \\frac{\\int z\\, w(z)\\, f(z)\\, dz}{\\int w(z)\\, f(z)\\, dz},\n$$\nand the selection differential is\n$$\nS = \\bar{z}_{\\text{sel}} - \\bar{z} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(w,z)}{\\bar{w}},\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{w} = \\int w(z) f(z)\\, dz$. Because $w(z)$ is decreasing in $z$, $\\operatorname{Cov}(w,z) < 0$, hence\n$$\nS < 0.\n$$\n\nThe breeder’s equation relates the evolutionary response to selection to heritability:\n$$\nR = \\Delta \\bar{z} = h^{2} S.\n$$\nGiven $h^{2} > 0$ (the trait is heritable) and $S < 0$, we have\n$$\nR < 0,\n$$\nso the population mean flower diameter decreases across generations. This is directional selection toward smaller flower size.\n\nThis outcome rules out the alternatives:\n- Disruptive selection (bimodality) requires both extremes to be favored relative to intermediates, which is not indicated; large flowers are disfavored, small flowers favored, so no bimodality.\n- No evolutionary change is incorrect because heritability and persistent selection imply a genetic response.\n- Stabilizing selection would reduce variance around an unchanged mean if both extremes were disfavored; here only one extreme (large) is disfavored.\n- Directional selection increasing mean contradicts $S < 0$.\n- Immediate extinction is not implied because smaller flowers have higher fitness under this selective regime.\n\nTherefore, the most likely long-term evolutionary consequence is directional selection leading to a decrease in average flower diameter.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1770584"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond qualitative descriptions, evolutionary biology often uses mathematical models to make precise, testable predictions. This exercise introduces a cornerstone of quantitative genetics, the breeder's equation, $R = h^2 S$. This practice will allow you to apply this formula to calculate the expected evolutionary response in a plant population under intense selective pressure, bridging the gap between the concept of selection and its measurable outcome [@problem_id:1770561].", "problem": "In a remote alpine meadow, a population of the flowering plant *Campanula montivaga* is being studied for its co-evolutionary relationship with a specialist florivorous weevil, *Miarus campanulae*. The plant produces a class of phenolic compounds in its petals that deter feeding by the weevil. The concentration of these compounds is a quantitative trait.\n\nA team of evolutionary biologists established that the mean concentration of these defensive phenolics across the entire plant population at the beginning of the flowering season was 88.0 micrograms per gram ($\\mu g/g$) of petal tissue. The narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$) of this trait in this specific population and environment was previously determined to be 0.40.\n\nDuring one particularly harsh season, an unusually large population of *Miarus campanulae* emerged, leading to intense selective pressure. The weevils preferentially consumed the petals of plants with lower phenolic concentrations. Consequently, only the plants that survived this intense herbivory were able to successfully reproduce. The mean phenolic concentration of these surviving, reproductive individuals was measured to be 103.0 $\\mu g/g$.\n\nAssuming this instance of herbivory is the only source of selection on this trait, predict the expected mean concentration of defensive phenolics in the immediate offspring generation. Express your answer in micrograms per gram ($\\mu g/g$) of petal tissue, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "We use the breeder’s equation from quantitative genetics, which relates the response to selection to the selection differential via narrow-sense heritability:\n$$R = h^{2} S.$$\nHere, the selection differential is the difference between the mean of the selected (reproducing) parents and the original population mean:\n$$S = \\bar{z}_{\\text{selected}} - \\bar{z}_{\\text{original}}.$$\nThe expected offspring mean is the original mean plus the response:\n$$\\bar{z}_{\\text{offspring}} = \\bar{z}_{\\text{original}} + R.$$\n\nSubstitute the given values.

This final practice presents a classic evolutionary puzzle: distinguishing the effects of natural selection from those of genetic drift. By evaluating different lines of evidence, you will learn to think like an evolutionary biologist, dissecting a scenario to determine whether a trait's prevalence is due to adaptive advantage or the random chance inherent in small populations [@problem_id:1770590].", "problem": "A mainland population of a flowering plant, *Petalidium grandiflorum*, is primarily pollinated by a nocturnal moth species. This plant has two alleles for flower color: a dominant allele `W` that produces white flowers, and a recessive allele `p` that produces purple flowers. On the mainland, the white-flowered phenotype has a significant fitness advantage as the moths are strongly attracted to white petals in low light, leading to much higher rates of pollination and seed production. Consequently, the recessive `p` allele is found at a very low frequency in the vast mainland population.\n\nA small group of seeds from this mainland population is transported by a storm and colonizes a remote, isolated island that has no native *Petalidium* plants. After several generations, botanists discover this new island population and are surprised to find that the frequency of the purple-flowered `p` allele is extremely high. The botanists wish to determine whether this high frequency is a result of genetic drift (specifically, the founder effect) or a result of natural selection acting differently in the new island environment.\n\nWhich of the following subsequent observations would provide the strongest evidence that the high frequency of the `p` allele on the island is a consequence of genetic drift rather than natural selection?\n\nA. A native bee species on the island is discovered to be the primary pollinator, and it shows a strong preference for visiting purple flowers over white flowers.\n\nB. The population size on the island remains small, and over the next several decades, the frequency of the `p` allele is observed to fluctuate unpredictably, with no clear correlation to rainfall, temperature, or pollinator activity.\n\nC. Seeds and pollen from the mainland are found to be arriving on the island at a steady rate, and the frequency of the `p` allele begins to decline, approaching the low frequency seen on the mainland.\n\nD. A detailed study of reproductive success reveals that, on average, individual purple-flowered plants on the island produce significantly more viable seeds per season than white-flowered plants.\n\nE. Genetic sequencing reveals that the rate at which the `W` allele mutates into the `p` allele is an order of magnitude higher in the island's environmental conditions than on the mainland.", "solution": "Define $q$ as the frequency of the recessive purple allele $p$ in the island population. The relevant population-genetic expectations under different evolutionary forces are:\n\n- Genetic drift in a diploid population of effective size $N_{e}$ causes random changes in allele frequency with\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta q]=0,\\quad \\operatorname{Var}(\\Delta q)=\\frac{q(1-q)}{2N_{e}}$$\nper generation (Wright-Fisher model). Drift is strongest when $N_{e}$ is small and produces unpredictable, non-directional fluctuations with no necessary correlation to environmental variables or fitness differences.\n\n- Directional natural selection generates a systematic change in allele frequency. If the purple allele increases fitness by selection coefficient $s$ (for concreteness, suppose purple has higher fitness), then, ignoring dominance for illustration, the expected change is approximately\n$$\\Delta q \\approx \\frac{s\\,p\\,q}{\\bar{w}},\\quad p=1-q,$$\nwhich is directional and should correlate with measurable fitness differences (e.g., pollinator preference, seed output).\n\n- Founder effect is a special case of drift: an initial sampling event from a large source population into a small number of colonists can produce a high $q$ by chance; subsequent dynamics in a small, isolated population will continue to reflect drift unless selection or migration dominates.\n\nEvaluate each observation:\n\nA. A strong pollinator preference for purple indicates a fitness advantage to purple flowers, predicting directional selection for the $p$ allele (nonzero average $\\Delta q$ correlated with pollinator behavior), which supports selection, not drift.\n\nB. Persistently small population size and allele-frequency fluctuations that are unpredictable and uncorrelated with environmental factors or pollinator activity match the drift signature: $\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta q]=0$ with variance inversely proportional to $N_{e}$, consistent with founder effect establishing a high initial $q$ and ongoing random changes.\n\nC. Steady gene flow from the mainland causing $q$ to decline toward the mainland value indicates migration overriding island dynamics. This does not distinguish drift from selection as the initial cause; migration can counter either.\n\nD. Higher average viable seed production by purple plants directly demonstrates a fitness advantage to the $p$ allele, predicting directional selection ($\\Delta q>0$ on average), not drift.\n\nE. An elevated mutation rate from $W$ to $p$ points to mutation pressure as the cause of high $q$, not drift; this is a different mechanism.\n\nTherefore, the observation that most strongly supports genetic drift (founder effect) rather than natural selection is the small population with unpredictable, uncorrelated allele-frequency fluctuations.\n\nHence, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1770590"}]}
