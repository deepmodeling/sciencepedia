{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A single genome contains the blueprint for every cell in an organism, yet a root cell is vastly different from a petal cell. Epigenetic modifications provide the \"instructions\" that dictate which parts of the blueprint are used in each cell type. This first exercise challenges you to think like a molecular biologist, using data on DNA methylation to deduce a gene's function based on where it is epigenetically silenced or activated [@problem_id:1746271]. This skill of linking expression patterns to biological roles is fundamental to modern genetics.", "problem": "In many eukaryotes, gene expression is regulated by epigenetic modifications, which do not alter the Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) sequence itself. One common modification is DNA methylation, where the addition of methyl groups to a gene's promoter region typically leads to transcriptional silencing, effectively turning the gene \"off\".\n\nA molecular biologist is investigating gene regulation in a model plant species. They focus on a gene named `FLOR1`. Their research reveals that the promoter of the `FLOR1` gene is heavily methylated in root cells, and consequently, the gene is not transcribed in these cells. Conversely, in the cells of the flower's petals, the `FLOR1` promoter is found to be unmethylated, and the gene is actively transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA).\n\nBased solely on this pattern of differential gene expression, which of the following describes the most probable function of the protein encoded by the `FLOR1` gene?\n\nA. Facilitating the transport of water and minerals through the plant's vascular tissue.\n\nB. Synthesizing Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) through glycolysis in the cytoplasm.\n\nC. Producing a volatile organic compound that functions to attract pollinators.\n\nD. Repairing DNA damage from various mutagens in all living tissues of the plant.\n\nE. It is fundamentally impossible to infer any aspect of a gene's function from its expression pattern.", "solution": "Principle: Epigenetic DNA methylation at a gene’s promoter typically represses transcription; an unmethylated promoter permits transcription. Therefore, promoter methylation status correlates inversely with gene expression.\n\nGiven observations: In root cells, the FLOR1 promoter is heavily methylated and the gene is not transcribed; in petal cells, the promoter is unmethylated and the gene is actively transcribed into mRNA. Thus, FLOR1 exhibits tissue-specific expression: off in roots, on in petals.\n\nInference: A gene that is silenced in roots but active in petals most likely encodes a function required in petals, not a housekeeping or ubiquitous function. Housekeeping functions (e.g., glycolysis, DNA repair, core transport in vascular tissues) are generally required in most or all living cells and therefore are typically expressed broadly and constitutively, not restricted to petals via promoter methylation.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A. Facilitating transport of water and minerals through vascular tissue is a ubiquitous function involving xylem/phloem throughout the plant, including roots and stems. This should not be restricted to petals; inconsistent with petal-specific expression.\n- B. ATP synthesis via glycolysis is a core metabolic pathway required in nearly all cells, including roots; inconsistent with repression in roots.\n- C. Producing a volatile organic compound to attract pollinators is a classic petal-associated function, often enriched in floral tissues where scent is produced; consistent with expression in petals and repression in non-floral tissues like roots.\n- D. DNA repair is essential in all living tissues; such genes are typically broadly expressed; inconsistent with silencing in roots.\n- E. It is not fundamentally impossible to infer function from expression; tissue-specific expression patterns are routinely used to hypothesize gene function.\n\nConclusion: The observed petal-specific expression pattern most strongly supports a role in producing compounds for pollinator attraction.\n\nTherefore, the most probable function is described by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1746271"}, {"introduction": "Inferring gene function from epigenetic patterns is powerful, but how do scientists actually \"see\" these marks on the DNA? To test hypotheses about epigenetic inheritance, researchers rely on specialized molecular techniques. This problem focuses on bisulfite sequencing, the gold-standard method for mapping DNA methylation, and asks you to pinpoint its precise role within a transgenerational inheritance experiment [@problem_id:1746299]. Understanding the tools of the trade is crucial for critically evaluating scientific claims in epigenetics.", "problem": "A team of researchers is investigating a potential case of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in a mouse model. They expose a group of male mice (the $F_0$ generation) to a novel environmental compound and observe that these mice develop a distinct anxiety-like behavior. To test if this acquired trait is heritable, they breed these exposed $F_0$ males with unexposed females. The resulting offspring (the $F_1$ generation), which are never directly exposed to the compound, also exhibit the same anxiety-like behavior.\n\nThe researchers hypothesize that the inherited behavioral change is mediated by DNA methylation. To test this, they decide to perform whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on DNA isolated from the sperm of the $F_0$ males and from the somatic cells of the $F_1$ offspring. What is the fundamental scientific purpose of using bisulfite sequencing in this experimental context?\n\nA. To detect any new germline mutations in the primary DNA nucleotide sequence (A, T, C, G) induced by the compound.\n\nB. To measure the relative abundance of different messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts related to neural function.\n\nC. To identify the specific locations of histone modifications, such as acetylation and phosphorylation, on the chromatin.\n\nD. To determine the positions of methylated cytosines versus unmethylated cytosines across the entire genome.", "solution": "The experimental question is whether an acquired behavioral phenotype is transmitted via DNA methylation marks between generations. To test a methylation-based mechanism, the assay must directly distinguish methylated cytosines from unmethylated cytosines across the genome.\n\nBisulfite sequencing is designed precisely for this. The core chemical principle is that sodium bisulfite deaminates unmethylated cytosines to uracil, whereas 5-methylcytosines are resistant to this conversion. After bisulfite treatment and PCR amplification, uracils are replicated as thymines, while methylated cytosines remain as cytosines. When the treated DNA is sequenced and aligned to the reference genome, cytosines that appear as thymines indicate originally unmethylated sites, and cytosines that remain as cytosines indicate originally methylated sites. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing applies this at base-pair resolution across the entire genome, producing a methylome map.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because detecting new germline mutations in the primary DNA sequence is the purpose of standard whole-genome sequencing without bisulfite conversion; bisulfite treatment deliberately alters the sequence at unmethylated cytosines and is not optimized for calling primary sequence mutations.\n- Option B is incorrect because measuring mRNA abundance is performed by RNA sequencing or related transcriptomic methods, not DNA bisulfite sequencing.\n- Option C is incorrect because mapping histone modifications requires chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) with modification-specific antibodies, not bisulfite chemistry.\n- Option D is correct because bisulfite sequencing determines the genomic positions of methylated versus unmethylated cytosines at single-base resolution.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental scientific purpose in this context is to determine methylation status across the genome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1746299"}, {"introduction": "Epigenetic marks are not necessarily permanent; their stability determines whether they function as a temporary switch or a heritable trait. The persistence of these marks across cell divisions is governed by a balance between passive dilution and active maintenance. This final practice moves beyond qualitative descriptions to a quantitative model, asking you to derive an expression for the stability of an epigenetic mark [@problem_id:1746285]. By comparing a simple passive inheritance model with one that includes active reinforcement, you will gain a deeper, mathematical appreciation for the mechanisms that ensure epigenetic memory.", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the transgenerational effects of a rare environmental stressor on two model organisms: a simple invertebrate (Species A) and an annual plant (Species P). The stressor induces a specific DNA methylation pattern, or 'epigenetic mark', at a single genetic locus.\n\nIn Species A, which has a segregated germline, the mark is successfully induced in a single germline stem cell. This cell then undergoes $n$ synchronous rounds of mitosis to generate the population of gamete precursors. The inheritance of this epigenetic mark is imperfect. At each cell division, a daughter cell of a marked parent has a probability $p$ of correctly inheriting the mark. If a cell does not inherit the mark, it and all its descendants will remain unmarked.\n\nIn Species P, the epigenetic mark is induced in a single apical meristem cell. This cell and its descendants also undergo $n$ synchronous rounds of mitosis to form the tissue that will eventually produce gametes. The inheritance in Species P involves two processes. First, there is a passive inheritance step identical to that in Species A, where the mark is passed to a daughter cell with probability $p$. Second, if a daughter cell *fails* to inherit the mark passively (an event with probability $1-p$), an active maintenance mechanism specific to the plant has a probability $q$ of recognizing the locus and re-establishing the mark. This active reinforcement occurs immediately after the division and only acts on cells that would have otherwise become unmarked.\n\nLet $P_A(n)$ be the probability that a single descendant cell, chosen at random after $n$ divisions, carries the epigenetic mark in Species A. Let $P_P(n)$ be the corresponding probability for Species P. Assume the initial single cell in both cases is marked before the first division.\n\nDerive a concise, closed-form analytic expression for the ratio $R(n) = \\frac{P_P(n)}{P_A(n)}$ as a function of $n$, $p$, and $q$ for $n \\ge 1$.", "solution": "We model the probability that a randomly chosen descendant after $n$ synchronous divisions is marked by following a single random lineage from the initially marked cell through $n$ successive divisions. Due to symmetry and exchangeability among the $2^{n}$ descendants, the probability that a uniformly chosen terminal cell is marked equals the probability that the mark persists along a single ancestral path of length $n$. Moreover, once the mark is lost at any division along the lineage, all descendants on that path remain unmarked.\n\nSpecies A:\nLet $P_A(n)$ denote the probability a random descendant is marked after $n$ divisions, starting from a marked initial cell. At each division along the lineage, conditional on the parent being marked, the daughter inherits the mark with probability $p$. Therefore, the mark persists through $n$ consecutive divisions if and only if inheritance succeeds at all $n$ steps. This yields the recurrence\n$$\nP_A(n+1) = p\\,P_A(n), \\quad P_A(0)=1,\n$$\nwhose solution is\n$$\nP_A(n) = p^{n}.\n$$\n\nSpecies P:\nLet $P_P(n)$ denote the analogous probability for the plant. For a marked parent, the daughter ends marked after one division if either the passive step succeeds (probability $p$) or the passive step fails (probability $1-p$) but the active maintenance restores the mark (probability $q$). Thus the effective per-division transmission probability from a marked parent is\n$$\np+(1-p)q = 1 - (1-p)(1-q).\n$$\nAs loss remains irreversible (no acquisition from an unmarked parent), the lineage-level recurrence is\n$$\nP_P(n+1) = \\big(p+(1-p)q\\big)\\,P_P(n), \\quad P_P(0)=1,\n$$\ngiving\n$$\nP_P(n) = \\big(p+(1-p)q\\big)^{n}.\n$$\n\nRatio:\nTherefore, for $n \\ge 1$,\n$$\nR(n) = \\frac{P_P(n)}{P_A(n)} = \\left(\\frac{p+(1-p)q}{p}\\right)^{n}.\n$$\nThis expression also equals $\\left(1+\\frac{(1-p)q}{p}\\right)^{n}$ or $\\left(\\frac{1-(1-p)(1-q)}{p}\\right)^{n}$, all algebraically equivalent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{p+(1-p)q}{p}\\right)^{n}}$$", "id": "1746285"}]}
