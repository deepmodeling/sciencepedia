This model posits that the identity of organs developing in the four concentric whorls of a flower is determined by the combinatorial expression of three classes of homeotic genes: A, B, and C. The rules of this model for a wild-type flower are as follows:\n\n1.  There are four floral whorls, numbered 1 (outermost) to 4 (innermost).\n2.  A-class gene expression alone in whorl 1 specifies sepals.\n3.  Co-expression of A-class and B-class genes in whorl 2 specifies petals.\n4.  Co-expression of B-class and C-class genes in whorl 3 specifies stamens.\n5.  C-class gene expression alone in whorl 4 specifies carpels.\n6.  A-class and C-class genes are mutually antagonistic: expression of A-class genes represses C-class genes, and vice-versa. In a wild-type flower, this results in A-class expression being confined to whorls 1 and 2, and C-class expression being confined to whorls 3 and 4. B-class genes are normally expressed in whorls 2 and 3.\n\nConsider a genetic engineering experiment where a biologist creates a transgenic plant. In this plant, the B-class genes are placed under the control of a constitutive promoter, causing them to be expressed in all four floral whorls (1, 2, 3, and 4). Assume that the expression patterns and antagonism of A-class and C-class genes are unaffected.\n\nBased on the rules of the ABC model, what sequence of floral organs, from the outermost whorl (1) to the innermost whorl (4), would you expect to find in the flowers of this transgenic plant?\n\nA.
