To begin our practice, we will examine a clear-cut case of an increased developmental rate, known as acceleration.

The first species, *Xerophytum perennis*, is a perennial that lives in a semi-arid region with relatively predictable seasonal rainfall. This species is considered to represent the ancestral developmental pattern for the genus. The second species, *Xerophytum annuum*, is an annual that has adapted to a hyper-arid desert environment, where rainfall is infrequent and ephemeral.\n\nThe botanist records the following developmental milestones for both species, starting from the day of germination (Day 0):\n\nFor *Xerophytum perennis* (ancestral perennial):\n- The primary taproot reaches a depth of 10 cm on Day 12.\n- The first set of true leaves fully expands on Day 15.\n- The plant reaches sexual maturity, marked by the opening of the first flower, on Day 70.\n\nFor *Xerophytum annuum* (derived annual):\n- The primary taproot reaches a depth of 10 cm on Day 5.\n- The first set of true leaves fully expands on Day 15.\n- The plant reaches sexual maturity, marked by the opening of the first flower, on Day 40.\n\nThe evolutionary modification observed in the development of the primary taproot in *Xerophytum annuum* compared to its ancestor is a classic example of what specific type of heterochrony?\n\nA.

Predisplacement", "solution": "Heterochrony refers to evolutionary changes in the timing or rate of developmental processes relative to an ancestor, producing morphological or life-history differences. The principal categories relevant here are:\n- Changes in developmental rate: acceleration (increased rate) versus deceleration; in whole-organism somatic terms, deceleration is often termed neoteny.\n- Shifts in onset: predisplacement (earlier onset) versus postdisplacement (later onset).\n- Shifts in offset: hypermorphosis (later offset/extended development) versus progenesis (earlier offset/earlier reproductive maturity).\n\nWe compare the specific developmental event for the primary taproot between the ancestral perennial and the derived annual:\n- In the ancestor, the primary taproot reaches a depth of 10 cm on Day 12.\n- In the derived species, the primary taproot reaches a depth of 10 cm on Day 5.\nBoth timelines are measured from germination (Day 0), the natural onset of root development, so there is no evidence that the onset of taproot development starts earlier than Day 0 in the derived species. The same absolute event (reaching 10 cm depth) occurs earlier in absolute time, which most parsimoniously indicates a higher rate of taproot elongation.\n\nTherefore, the taproot shows an increased rate of development relative to the ancestor, which is the definition of acceleration. By contrast:\n- Predisplacement would require an earlier onset of the process; the onset is already at germination and no earlier onset is indicated.\n- Postdisplacement and neoteny/deceleration predict later or slower attainment of the milestone, contrary to observation.\n- Progenesis and hypermorphosis concern the offset of development or timing of reproductive maturity and are not the correct characterization of this specific organ-level change (even though the species as a whole also flowers earlier).\n\nHence, the observed heterochronic change in taproot development is acceleration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1750409"}, {"introduction": "Evolutionary change is not always about developing faster or further; sometimes, retaining juvenile features into adulthood, a process called paedomorphosis, opens up new adaptive possibilities. This practice explores a classic example in skinks [@problem_id:1750468], where a slower rate of somatic development, or neoteny, results in a novel adult form. Your task will be to correctly identify this mechanism by carefully comparing the timing of somatic growth to the onset of sexual maturity.", "problem": "In the Philippine archipelago, two closely related lineages of skinks from the genus *Brachymeles* provide a classic example of evolutionary adaptation. One lineage is a surface-dweller and represents the ancestral condition. A typical surface-dwelling individual undergoes a developmental process where its body becomes covered in large, overlapping, protective keratinous scales. This process of scale formation is essentially complete by the time the skink reaches sexual maturity at an age of 12 months.\n\nA second lineage, having diverged from the first, is adapted to a fossorial (burrowing) lifestyle. A key adaptation for this lifestyle is a reduction in friction against the soil. These burrowing skinks achieve this with exceptionally smooth skin. Examination reveals that this phenotype is the result of a modification to the ancestral developmental program. In the burrowing lineage, the rate of scale growth and differentiation is dramatically reduced compared to the surface-dwelling ancestor. Consequently, when an individual from the burrowing lineage reaches sexual maturity, also at an age of 12 months, its scales are rudimentary, small, and non-overlapping, resembling an early developmental stage of its surface-dwelling relatives.\n\nBased on the principles of evolutionary developmental biology, which of the following terms best describes the heterochronic process responsible for the evolution of the smooth-skinned phenotype in the burrowing skink?\n\nA. Peramorphosis via acceleration\n\nB. Paedomorphosis via progenesis\n\nC. Paedomorphosis via neoteny\n\nD. Peramorphosis via hypermorphosis\n\nE. Recapitulation", "solution": "We identify the process as a form of heterochrony, defined as a change in the timing and/or rate of developmental processes relative to an ancestor.\n\nLet $t_{m}$ denote the age at sexual maturity and $D(t)$ denote the degree of scale differentiation attained by time $t$. Let $r_{s}$ denote the rate of scale growth and differentiation.\n\nFor the surface-dwelling ancestor:\n- Sexual maturity occurs at $t_{m,\\text{anc}}=12$ months.\n- By $t_{m,\\text{anc}}$, the scales are fully differentiated, so $D_{\\text{anc}}(t_{m,\\text{anc}})=D_{\\text{adult}}$.\n\nFor the burrowing lineage:\n- Sexual maturity occurs at the same time, $t_{m,\\text{bur}}=12$ months.\n- The rate of somatic development of scales is reduced, so $r_{s,\\text{bur}}<r_{s,\\text{anc}}$.\n- Consequently, at $t_{m,\\text{bur}}$, the organism retains juvenile-like scale morphology, so $D_{\\text{bur}}(t_{m,\\text{bur}})\\approx D_{\\text{juvenile}}$.\n\nThis outcome—an adult retaining juvenile somatic traits because somatic development proceeds more slowly while the timing of reproductive maturity is unchanged—corresponds to paedomorphosis via neoteny.\n\nRuling out alternatives:\n- Paedomorphosis via progenesis requires accelerated reproductive maturation (a decrease in $t_{m}$), which is not observed since $t_{m,\\text{bur}}=t_{m,\\text{anc}}$.\n- Peramorphosis via acceleration or hypermorphosis would produce exaggerated or extended adult traits, not juvenile-like traits.\n- Recapitulation is not the correct heterochronic mechanism and does not match the described pattern.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is paedomorphosis via neoteny.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1750468"}, {"introduction": "While qualitative descriptions are useful, a deeper understanding of heterochrony comes from quantifying developmental changes.

Population A, the ancestral group, inhabits a large, stable lake and undergoes a typical metamorphic life cycle. Population B is found in a recently formed, isolated pond and has evolved paedomorphosis, a condition where individuals become sexually mature while retaining juvenile features, such as external gills, and remaining fully aquatic.\n\nTo understand the developmental changes underlying this evolutionary shift, the biologists raised larvae from both populations in a controlled laboratory setting. They tracked the time required for individuals to reach metamorphosis. For the naturally paedomorphic Population B, metamorphosis was induced artificially at different body masses using a standard hormone treatment.\n\nThe relationship between the time from hatching to metamorphosis, $T_{meta}$ (in days), and the body mass at the onset of metamorphosis, $M$ (in grams), is described by the allometric equation:\n$$T_{meta} = \\beta M^{\\alpha}$$\nHere, $\\alpha$ is the scaling exponent, which governs how developmental time scales with body mass, and $\\beta$ is the allometric coefficient, which is inversely related to the overall rate of development.\n\nThe researchers collected the following data:\n- **Population A (Ancestral):**\n  - An individual metamorphosed at a mass of $M = 9.0$ g after $T_{meta} = 120$ days.\n  - Another individual metamorphosed at a mass of $M = 25.0$ g after $T_{meta} = 200$ days.\n- **Population B (Paedomorphic, Induced Metamorphosis):**\n  - An individual induced to metamorphose at $M = 16.0$ g completed the process after a total of $T_{meta} = 304$ days from hatching.\n  - Another individual induced to metamorphose at $M = 81.0$ g completed the process after $T_{meta} = 1026$ days.\n\nTo quantify the primary driver of the evolutionary change, the biologists propose calculating the 'evolutionary divergence ratio', $R$, defined as the ratio of the fractional change in the scaling exponent ($\\alpha$) to the fractional change in the allometric coefficient ($\\beta$). This is given by:\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{|\\alpha_B - \\alpha_A|}{\\alpha_A}}{\\frac{|\\beta_B - \\beta_A|}{\\beta_A}}$$\nwhere $\\alpha_A$ and $\\beta_A$ are the parameters for Population A, and $\\alpha_B$ and $\\beta_B$ are for Population B.
