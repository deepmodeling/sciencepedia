The behavior is quantified using an open-field test, where each mouse is placed in a novel gridded arena. Its 'exploratory score' is the number of unique grid squares the mouse enters within a 5-minute observation period.\n\nThe initial parental generation has a mean exploratory score of 52.0. From this population, the researchers select a specific group of individuals with the highest scores to be the parents of the next generation. The mean exploratory score of this selected parental group is 87.0.\n\nFor this mouse population, the narrow-sense heritability of the exploratory score trait has been determined to be 0.35.\n\nAssuming the selection proceeds as described and all environmental factors remain constant across generations, calculate the expected mean exploratory score for the offspring generation.

This practice explores this trade-off by examining the case of the domestic silk moth, a species so modified by human selection that it can no longer survive in its ancestral environment. By calculating its relative fitness, you will quantify the profound evolutionary consequences of domestication [@problem_id:1731941].", "problem": "The domestic silk moth, *Bombyx mori*, has been subject to thousands of years of artificial selection for traits that maximize silk production. This process has resulted in significant divergence from its wild ancestor, *Bombyx mandarina*. Consider a hypothetical scenario where a large population of *Bombyx mori* is accidentally released into a protected nature reserve, which constitutes the native habitat of *Bombyx mandarina*.\n\nTo assess the potential impact and long-term viability of the released population, we want to calculate its overall fitness relative to its wild ancestor. The fitness of an organism is a measure of its total reproductive success and can be modeled as the product of the probabilities of surviving through different life stages and the number of offspring produced.\n\nThe wild ancestor, *Bombyx mandarina*, is perfectly adapted to this environment, and we define its overall fitness as a baseline value of 1.0. The domesticated traits of *Bombyx mori* alter its fitness components as follows when placed in this wild environment:\n\n1.  **Larval Survival:** The conspicuous white coloration of *B. mori* larvae, a trait selected for by humans, makes them highly visible to predators. Consequently, their probability of surviving from hatching to pupation is only 4.0% of that of the well-camouflaged *B. mandarina* larvae.\n\n2.  **Adult Success (Survival and Mating):** Adult *B. mori* moths have lost the ability to fly. The females are sedentary, and males exhibit only a weak, fluttering flight. This drastically impairs their ability to evade predators and for males to locate the stationary females. The combined effect is that the probability of a *B. mori* adult surviving long enough to mate *and* successfully finding a mate is a mere 0.50% of that for a wild *B. mandarina* adult.\n\n3.  **Fecundity:** Artificial selection has resulted in larger *B. mori* females that produce more eggs. A *B. mori* female that successfully mates will lay, on average, 1.8 times the number of eggs as a wild *B. mandarina* female.\n\nAssuming these three factors are multiplicative in their effect on overall fitness, calculate the overall relative fitness value of the released *Bombyx mori* population.

This final practice moves from single-generation predictions to modeling the long-term evolutionary trajectory of an allele under a consistent breeding strategy. You will calculate how truncation selection in a soybean population can drive a beneficial allele for oil content towards fixation, providing a deeper look into the genetic engine of artificial selection [@problem_id:1731953].", "problem": "A team of agricultural scientists is running a breeding program to increase the oil content in a specific variety of soybean. The oil content is a quantitative trait influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Their analysis has identified a single major gene locus that significantly impacts oil content. This locus has two alleles: $A_1$, which contributes to higher oil content, and $A_2$. The genetic effect is purely additive: the baseline oil content is determined by the $A_2A_2$ genotype, the $A_1A_2$ genotype has an oil content that is higher by an amount $\\alpha$, and the $A_1A_1$ genotype is higher by $2\\alpha$. The observed phenotypic variation in oil content is also subject to environmental influences, which are captured by an environmental variance, $\\sigma_E^2$.\n\nThe breeding strategy employed is truncation selection. In each generation, the scientists measure the oil content of all plants and select only the top 25% of individuals with the highest oil content to be the parents for the next generation. These parents are then randomly mated to produce offspring.\n\nInitially, in generation 0, the allele frequency of the high-oil allele ($A_1$) is $p_0 = 0.5$, and the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. You are given the following parameters:\n- Additive effect of the $A_1$ allele: $\\alpha = 0.5$ (in units of oil percentage points).\n- Environmental variance: $\\sigma_E^2 = 0.375$ (in units of oil percentage points squared).\n- The selection intensity, $i$, corresponding to selecting the top 25% of a normally distributed trait is $i = 1.271$.\n\nTo simplify the analysis, you are to assume that the total phenotypic standard deviation of the population, $\\sigma_P$, remains constant throughout the selection process and is equal to its initial value in generation 0.\n\nCalculate the allele frequency of $A_1$ after 20 generations of this selection protocol.
