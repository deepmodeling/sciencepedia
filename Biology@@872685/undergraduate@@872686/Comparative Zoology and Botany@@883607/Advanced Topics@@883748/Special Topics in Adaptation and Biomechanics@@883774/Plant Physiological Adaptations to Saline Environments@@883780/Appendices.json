This first exercise simulates an \"osmotic shock\" scenario, where a plant unaccustomed to salt is suddenly exposed to a saline solution. By calculating and comparing the water potential of the soil and the plant, you will quantitatively determine the direction of water flow and predict the immediate physiological consequences for the plant, providing a crucial baseline for understanding why specialized adaptations are necessary [@problem_id:1766377].", "problem": "A botanist is investigating the effects of salinity on a tomato plant (*Solanum lycopersicum*), a species not adapted to saline conditions. The plant is initially healthy and well-watered, and the water potential ($\\Psi_{\\text{plant}}$) within its root xylem is measured to be -0.75 megapascals (MPa). The botanist suddenly irrigates the plant's soil with a 200 millimolar (mM) sodium chloride (NaCl) solution.\n\nAssume the soil temperature is 25 °C and the saline solution rapidly equilibrates with the soil water. The ideal gas constant, $R$, is 8.314 J·mol⁻¹·K⁻¹. For the purpose of this problem, assume that sodium chloride completely dissociates into its constituent ions in the solution and that the pressure potential of the soil water is zero.\n\nBased on a comparison of water potentials, which of the following describes the immediate, primary physiological response of the plant's roots?\n\nA. Water will move from the soil into the root cells, causing a rapid increase in turgor pressure.\n\nB. Water will move out of the root cells into the surrounding soil, leading to plasmolysis and causing the plant to wilt.\n\nC. No net movement of water will occur, as the water potential of the plant and the soil solution are approximately equal.\n\nD. The root cells will actively transport water into the plant against the water potential gradient to prevent dehydration.\n\nE.

The key to their survival is not just preventing water from leaving, but actively managing internal salt concentrations. This thought experiment invites you to explore the molecular machinery behind vacuolar sequestration, a primary strategy for salt tolerance, by predicting the consequences of disabling a critical component in this transport system [@problem_id:1766358].", "problem": "A halophyte is a plant species that has evolved physiological adaptations to survive and reproduce in environments with high salt concentrations. A key strategy for these plants is \"vacuolar sequestration,\" where they actively transport excess salt ions, particularly sodium ($Na^{+}$), from the cytoplasm into the large central vacuole of their cells. This process prevents cytoplasmic ion toxicity and helps maintain a favorable water potential gradient, allowing the plant to absorb water from saline soil.\n\nThis sequestration mechanism relies on two main proteins located on the vacuolar membrane, also known as the tonoplast:\n1.  The vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase): A primary active transport pump that hydrolyzes Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to move protons ($H^{+}$) from the cytoplasm into the vacuole.\n2.  The Na+/H+ antiporter: A secondary active transport protein that uses the electrochemical gradient established by the V-ATPase to move $Na^{+}$ ions into the vacuole while moving $H^{+}$ ions out.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered halophyte in which a specific mutation completely disables the function of its vacuolar H+-ATPase pumps, while all other cellular components, including the Na+/H+ antiporters, remain fully functional. Which of the following statements most accurately predicts the primary consequence of this mutation on the plant's ability to tolerate high-salinity conditions?\n\nA. The plant's salt tolerance will increase because the cell conserves a significant amount of ATP that would otherwise be used by the V-ATPase.\n\nB. The plant's salt tolerance will be unaffected because the Na+/H+ antiporters can still transport sodium, and the plant can rely solely on synthesizing organic solutes in the cytoplasm for osmotic adjustment.\n\nC. The plant's salt tolerance will drastically decrease because the Na+/H+ antiporters will lack the necessary proton motive force to sequester sodium ions in the vacuole.\n\nD. The plant's salt tolerance will be unaffected because pumps on the plasma membrane will expel the excess sodium ions from the cell, completely compensating for the loss of vacuolar sequestration.\n\nE. The plant's salt tolerance will drastically decrease because the mutation will cause the vacuolar membrane to become freely permeable to all ions, leading to a collapse of cellular function.", "solution": "The vacuolar H^{+}-ATPase (V-ATPase) is a primary active transporter that hydrolyzes ATP to pump protons into the vacuole, establishing a proton electrochemical gradient across the tonoplast. The electrochemical potential difference for protons is\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu_{H^{+}} = RT \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[H^{+}]_{\\text{vacuole}}}{[H^{+}]_{\\text{cytosol}}}\\right) + zF\\Delta \\psi,\n$$\nwith $z=+1$ for $H^{+}$, $R$ the gas constant, $T$ the absolute temperature, $F$ the Faraday constant, and $\\Delta \\psi$ the tonoplast potential (vacuole relative to cytosol). The V-ATPase makes $\\Delta \\mu_{H^{+}}$ large and positive inside the vacuole, so that $H^{+}$ has a strong tendency to move from the vacuole to the cytosol.\n\nThe vacuolar $Na^{+}/H^{+}$ antiporter uses this stored energy to drive secondary active transport: it couples $Na^{+}$ influx into the vacuole to $H^{+}$ efflux to the cytosol. For a one-for-one exchange, the coupled free energy change is\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{coupled}} = \\Delta \\mu_{Na^{+}}^{\\text{in}} + \\Delta \\mu_{H^{+}}^{\\text{out}},\n$$\nwhere\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu_{Na^{+}}^{\\text{in}} = RT \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[Na^{+}]_{\\text{vacuole}}}{[Na^{+}]_{\\text{cytosol}}}\\right) + F\\Delta \\psi,\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu_{H^{+}}^{\\text{out}} = RT \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[H^{+}]_{\\text{cytosol}}}{[H^{+}]_{\\text{vacuole}}}\\right) - F\\Delta \\psi = -\\Delta \\mu_{H^{+}}.\n$$\nSequestration of $Na^{+}$ into the vacuole against its gradient requires $\\Delta \\mu_{Na^{+}}^{\\text{in}} > 0$, which is only made thermodynamically favorable if it is offset by a sufficiently negative $\\Delta \\mu_{H^{+}}^{\\text{out}}$ supplied by the V-ATPase-generated proton motive force.\n\nIf the V-ATPase is completely disabled, $\\Delta \\mu_{H^{+}} \\to 0$ and hence $\\Delta \\mu_{H^{+}}^{\\text{out}} \\to 0$. The antiporter then lacks the driving force to move $Na^{+}$ into the vacuole against its electrochemical gradient, so vacuolar sequestration of $Na^{+}$ fails. The result is elevated cytosolic $Na^{+}$, leading to ion toxicity, disruption of enzyme function and metabolic processes, and loss of the osmotic advantage conferred by vacuolar ion storage. Energy conservation from not running the V-ATPase does not mitigate these effects, and alternative mechanisms such as plasma membrane extrusion cannot fully compensate for the lack of intracellular sequestration under high salinity. The mutation does not render the tonoplast freely permeable; it specifically abolishes active $H^{+}$ pumping.\n\nTherefore, the primary consequence is a drastic decrease in salt tolerance due to the loss of the proton motive force required by the $Na^{+}/H^{+}$ antiporter.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1766358"}, {"introduction": "This final practice integrates the concepts of water potential and cellular adaptation into a whole-plant, real-world context.
