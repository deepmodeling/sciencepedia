The ADL is determined by the total usable oxygen stores and the rate at which this oxygen is consumed (the metabolic rate).\n\nConsider a hypothetical marine mammal. A fundamental physiological response to diving, known as the dive reflex, involves a significant reduction in metabolic rate. For this particular animal, the dive reflex suppresses its overall metabolic rate to $30.0\\%$ of its resting metabolic rate at the surface.
