Consider a seed from this species being released from a height $H = 25.0$ m into a steady horizontal wind of speed $v_{wind} = 5.00$ m/s. Due to its low mass and high air resistance, the seed is assumed to fall vertically at its constant terminal velocity, $v_{t} = 0.400$ m/s, relative to the air around it. The horizontal motion of the seed is determined solely by the wind.\n\nThe seeds of *Z. ponderosa* are heavy nuts. They are primarily dispersed by a species of forest rodent that collects the nuts and buries them in caches for later consumption. This rodent forages within a circular home range of radius $R_{home} = 215$ m, centered on the parent tree. For the purpose of this problem, the characteristic dispersal distance for *Z. ponderosa* is defined as the average distance from the center of a circle to any randomly chosen point within that circle.
