The goal is to maximize the genetic diversity retained in this small population before a future reintroduction into the wild. In the current generation, the breeding pool consists of a total of 100 individuals. However, due to breeding behaviors and availability, the number of males successfully contributing offspring ($N_m$) is 20, while the number of successfully breeding females ($N_f$) is 80. A key measure for assessing the risk of genetic drift is the effective population size ($N_e$), which represents the size of an idealized population that would experience the same rate of inbreeding and loss of genetic variation as the actual population.\n\nGiven the unequal number of breeding males and females, calculate the effective population size ($N_e$) for this generation of the Alpine Jewel Beetle.", "solution": "The effective population size for a population with separate sexes and unequal numbers of breeding males and females is given by Wright’s formula for the inbreeding effective size:\n$$\nN_{e} = \\frac{4 N_{m} N_{f}}{N_{m} + N_{f}}.\n$$\nSubstitute the given values $N_{m} = 20$ and $N_{f} = 80$:\n$$\nN_{e} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 20 \\cdot 80}{20 + 80}.\n$$\nCompute the denominator:\n$$\n20 + 80 = 100.\n$$\nCompute the numerator:\n$$\n4 \\cdot 20 \\cdot 80 = 6400.\n$$\nDivide numerator by denominator:\n$$\nN_{e} = \\frac{6400}{100} = 64.\n$$\nThus, the effective population size for this generation is $64$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{64}$$", "id": "1741401"}, {"introduction": "Wild populations rarely maintain a constant size; they often fluctuate due to environmental factors like resource availability.
