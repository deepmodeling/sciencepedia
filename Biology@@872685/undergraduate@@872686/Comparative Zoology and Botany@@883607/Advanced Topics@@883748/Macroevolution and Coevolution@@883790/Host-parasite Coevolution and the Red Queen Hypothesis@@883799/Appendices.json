This event provides an opportunity to study the initiation of a coevolutionary arms race, often described by the Red Queen hypothesis.\n\nWe model the interaction using a simplified gene-for-gene system:\n- The host plant population has a single gene for resistance, `G`, with two alleles: a dominant resistance allele `R` and a recessive susceptibility allele `r`.\n- The pathogenic fungus population has a single gene for virulence, `A`, with two alleles: an avirulent allele `v` and a virulent allele `V`.\n\nThe rules of infection are as follows:\n- Plants with at least one `R` allele (genotypes `RR` or `Rr`) are resistant to infection by fungi with the `v` allele, but are susceptible to fungi with the `V` allele.\n- Plants with the `rr` genotype are susceptible to infection by fungi with either the `v` or `V` allele.\n\nThe fitness consequences are defined by the following parameters, where host fitness is defined on a scale from 0 to 1:\n- Any successful infection reduces the host plant's fitness by a fraction `L = 0.45`.\n- A plant carrying the `R` allele incurs a constitutive fitness cost of `c_R = 0.060`, regardless of whether it is infected.\n\nThe founding population of the fungus that colonizes the new host has an avirulent allele frequency of `q_v = 0.70`.\n\nAssuming the `R` allele is initially very rare in the naive host population, a strong selective pressure to increase its frequency will arise. This pressure can be quantified by the initial selection coefficient, `s_R`, for the `R` allele. The selection coefficient is defined as the difference between the average fitness of the resistance allele (`W_R`) and the average fitness of the susceptible allele (`W_r`).\n\nCalculate the numerical value of the initial selection coefficient, `s_R`.

Under the gene-for-gene rules:\n- Hosts with genotype $rr$ are infected by both $v$ and $V$, so their infection probability is $1$.\n- Hosts carrying $R$ (when rare, almost all are $Rr$) are infected only by $V$, so their infection probability is $q_{V}$ and their non-infection probability is $q_{v}$.\n\nFitness effects are:\n- Any infection reduces fitness by $L$, so an infected plant has fitness $1 - L$.\n- Carrying $R$ imposes a constitutive cost $c_{R}$, so a plant with $R$ has a baseline fitness $1 - c_{R}$, whether infected or not.\n\nTherefore, the expected fitnesses are:\n- For $rr$ (always infected): \n$$\nW_{rr} = 1 - L.\n$$\n- For a carrier of $R$ (when rare, take $Rr$): with probability $q_{v}$ not infected and with probability $q_{V}$ infected,\n$$\nW_{R} = q_{v}(1 - c_{R}) + q_{V}(1 - c_{R} - L) = 1 - c_{R} - q_{V}L.\n$$\n\nThe initial selection coefficient for $R$ is the marginal fitness difference between the $R$ and $r$ alleles when $R$ is rare, which here is the difference between $W_{R}$ and $W_{rr}$:\n$$\ns_{R} = W_{R} - W_{rr} = \\left(1 - c_{R} - q_{V}L\\right) - \\left(1 - L\\right) = L(1 - q_{V}) - c_{R} = L q_{v} - c_{R}.\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given values $L = 0.45$, $q_{v} = 0.70$, and $c_{R} = 0.060$,\n$$\ns_{R} = 0.45 \\times 0.70 - 0.060 = 0.315 - 0.060 = 0.255.\n$$\nRounded to two significant figures, this is $0.26$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.26}$$", "id": "1751907"}, {"introduction": "Coevolutionary dynamics unfold over many generations, leaving behind patterns that can be deciphered through carefully designed experiments.

Every 20 generations, they collect and freeze samples of both the yeast population and the virus population.\n\nAfter the 200 generations are complete, they conduct a \"time-shift\" experiment to test predictions of different coevolutionary models.

A \"future\" host population, isolated at generation 140 (`H_140`).\n\nInfectivity is quantified by measuring the \"lysis efficiency,\" which is the proportion of host cells destroyed by the virus in a standard assay.

These layers form a \"frozen\" fossil record that can be dated accurately. By taking a sediment core, researchers can hatch *Daphnia* and culture parasites from specific time periods in the past.\n\nThis system provides a unique opportunity to test a key prediction of the Red Queen hypothesis. This hypothesis posits that hosts and parasites are locked in a continuous co-evolutionary arms race. A specific prediction arising from this is that parasites should be most adapted to infect their contemporary hosts—the hosts they co-evolved with at the same point in time—compared to hosts from the past (which may have outdated defenses) or the future (which may have evolved novel defenses).\n\nImagine you are a researcher who has successfully collected and dated a sediment core, from which you can resurrect *Daphnia* and parasites from three distinct time layers: Layer 1 (oldest), Layer 2 (intermediate), and Layer 3 (most recent). Your goal is to design an experiment that provides the most direct and robust test of the Red Queen prediction of temporal local adaptation.\n\nWhich of the following experimental designs would best achieve this goal?\n\nA. In a fully crossed design, expose hosts from each of the three layers to parasites from each of the three layers (e.g., Layer 1 hosts vs. Layer 1 parasites, Layer 1 hosts vs. Layer 2 parasites, etc., for all nine combinations).

Measure the infection success rate for each of these three pairings and compare them.\n\nD. Sequence the genomes of the *Daphnia* and the parasites from all three layers. Look for changes in the frequency of alleles known to be associated with host resistance and parasite infectivity over time.\n\nE. Expose hosts from the intermediate layer (Layer 2) to parasites from all three layers. At the same time, expose a standard laboratory strain of *Daphnia* (originally from a different ecosystem) to the same sets of parasites from the three layers. Compare the infection patterns between the resurrected host and the lab host.", "solution": "The Red Queen prediction of temporal local adaptation states that parasites should exhibit the highest infectivity against hosts from the same time period with which they co-evolved, compared to hosts from earlier or later periods. The most direct and robust empirical test is to measure infection success across all pairwise time-shifted host-parasite combinations and ask whether the contemporaneous combinations (the diagonal of a time-by-time infection matrix) show higher infectivity than mismatched combinations (the off-diagonals). This requires a fully reciprocal, time-shift cross-infection design that allows separation of host time effects, parasite time effects, and their interaction, and enables explicit comparison of diagonal versus off-diagonal performance.\n\nOption A implements exactly this design: resurrect hosts and parasites from three dated layers and perform all nine cross-infections. This allows:\n- Direct testing of the key prediction by comparing infectivity on the diagonal (Layer i parasites on Layer i hosts) to off-diagonals (Layer i parasites on Layer j hosts with i \\neq j).\n- Control for main effects of host and parasite time and their interaction, supporting robust statistical inference on temporal local adaptation.\n- Detection of asymmetries (e.g., parasites being better on recent or past hosts) and non-linear patterns across time.\n\nOption B only uses hosts from the most recent time and thus cannot assess whether parasites are specifically best on their own contemporaneous hosts, because it omits hosts from the other layers. It conflates parasite evolution with host background effects and does not test the diagonal versus off-diagonal contrast.\n\nOption C tests only contemporaneous pairs and provides no off-diagonal comparisons; it cannot test temporal local adaptation because it lacks mismatched time combinations.\n\nOption D relies on genomic data alone, which is indirect without a complete and validated genotype-to-phenotype map for infectivity and resistance; it cannot directly measure infection outcomes and thus is less direct and potentially misleading.\n\nOption E uses only one resurrected host layer and a non-coevolved lab strain; this does not constitute a full time-shift test and introduces confounding due to lack of shared evolutionary history in the lab strain.\n\nTherefore, the fully crossed, reciprocal time-shift infection assay in Option A is the most direct and robust test of the Red Queen prediction in this system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1974507"}]}
