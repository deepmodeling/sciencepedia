{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "In ecological research, a common challenge is to determine why a biological process, like symbiotic nodulation, is failing in a particular environment. Is the failure due to a limitation in the environment, such as the absence of a microbial partner, or is it due to an inherent defect in the host organism? This practice [@problem_id:1758352] guides you through designing a bioassay, a classic method that uses controlled comparisons to untangle these possibilities and pinpoint the root cause of the symbiotic failure.", "problem": "A botanist is investigating a field where a specific legume, which we will call *Legume-X*, is growing poorly and shows no signs of root nodule formation, a key process for nitrogen fixation. The botanist hypothesizes two possible causes for this failure:\n1. The field soil lacks the specific species of symbiotic *Rhizobium* bacteria required to form nodules with *Legume-X*.\n2. The population of *Legume-X* in this field has a genetic mutation that impairs its signaling pathway, preventing it from recognizing or establishing a symbiosis with compatible *Rhizobium*, even if they are present.\n\nTo distinguish between these two hypotheses, an experiment is designed using four treatment groups. The experiment uses plants from the field (*Field Legume-X*) and a control strain of the same species known to be healthy and fully capable of nodulation (*Control Legume-X*). It also uses soil from the field (*Field Soil*) and a laboratory-prepared culture containing a high concentration of the correct, compatible *Rhizobium* species (*Control Inoculum*).\n\nThe four treatment groups are set up as follows, with all other growth conditions (water, light, temperature, and non-nitrogen nutrients) being optimal for nodulation:\n\n- **Treatment 1**: *Field Legume-X* grown in sterile potting mix with an addition of *Field Soil*.\n- **Treatment 2**: *Field Legume-X* grown in sterile potting mix with an addition of *Control Inoculum*.\n- **Treatment 3**: *Control Legume-X* grown in sterile potting mix with an addition of *Field Soil*.\n- **Treatment 4**: *Control Legume-X* grown in sterile potting mix with an addition of *Control Inoculum*.\n\nAfter several weeks, the root systems are examined for the presence of nodules. Which of the following outcomes would most definitively support the hypothesis that the *Legume-X* from the field has a genetic signaling defect?\n\nA.

If compatible Rhizobium are absent from the growth medium, or if the plant’s signaling is defective, nodules will not form. Sterile potting mix ensures that only added microbial sources (Field Soil or Control Inoculum) supply bacteria. Control Legume-X (CL) is known to be capable of nodulation; Control Inoculum (CI) supplies a high concentration of the correct Rhizobium; Field Soil (FS) may or may not contain compatible Rhizobium; Field Legume-X (FL) may or may not be defective.\n\nLabel treatments:\n- Treatment 1: FL + FS.\n- Treatment 2: FL + CI.\n- Treatment 3: CL + FS.\n- Treatment 4: CL + CI.\n\nState the two hypotheses:\n- H1 (soil-lack hypothesis): FS lacks compatible Rhizobium.\n- H2 (plant-defect hypothesis): FL carries a genetic signaling defect preventing symbiosis even with compatible Rhizobium.\n\nDerive predictions under H1:\n- T1 (FL + FS): No nodules if FS lacks compatible Rhizobium.\n- T2 (FL + CI): Nodules form because CI supplies compatible Rhizobium and FL is assumed normal under H1.\n- T3 (CL + FS): No nodules if FS lacks compatible Rhizobium, even though CL is competent.\n- T4 (CL + CI): Nodules form because both partners are compatible and present.\n\nThus, a characteristic H1 pattern is T3 fails while T2 and T4 succeed; T1 fails.\n\nDerive predictions under H2:\n- T2 (FL + CI): No nodules because FL is defective, regardless of CI presence.\n- T4 (CL + CI): Nodules form because CL and CI are compatible.\n- T3 (CL + FS): Outcome depends on whether FS contains compatible Rhizobium. If FS does contain them, CL should nodulate; if it does not, CL will not nodulate.\n- T1 (FL + FS): No nodules if either FS lacks compatible Rhizobium or FL is defective; either way, failure here is non-diagnostic.\n\nDetermine the outcome that most definitively supports H2:\n- To attribute failure specifically to a defect in FL, we need to show (i) that FL cannot nodulate even when compatible Rhizobium are provided (T2 fails), and (ii) that compatible Rhizobium are indeed present in the FS (so the environment is not at fault), demonstrated by CL nodulating with FS (T3 succeeds). This pattern isolates the defect to the FL genotype.\n- This is exactly the pattern described in Option A: Nodules fail to form in Treatment 2 (FL + CI fails), but nodules do form in Treatment 3 (CL + FS succeeds), showing that the bacteria are present in FS and that CI being ineffective is unlikely when considered alongside T3 success and the overall design. In practice, T4 would also be expected to succeed, confirming CI functionality, but among the given options, A most directly and definitively supports H2.\n\nExclude other options:\n- B (T2 forms, T3 fails) supports H1 (soil lacks compatible Rhizobium), not H2.\n- C (T2 and T3 both form) implies both plants and both microbial sources are functional; this does not support a defect in FL.\n- D (T2 and T3 both fail) is ambiguous: could reflect simultaneous soil lack and plant defect, or problems with CI or conditions; not definitive for H2.\n- E (T1 fails, T4 forms) is expected under multiple scenarios and does not discriminate between H1 and H2.\n\nTherefore, the most definitive outcome for a genetic signaling defect in the field plants is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1758352"}, {"introduction": "Mycorrhizal symbioses are broadly categorized based on how the fungus interacts with the plant's root cells, leading to distinct structural and functional outcomes. To properly classify these relationships, scientists must act like detectives, gathering multiple lines of evidence. This exercise [@problem_id:1758398] challenges you to combine anatomical observations from microscopy with a quantitative analysis of the nutrient-for-carbon trade, allowing you to make a definitive classification and appreciate how structure and function are deeply intertwined in these mutualisms.", "problem": "A plant ecologist is investigating the nature of a symbiotic relationship between a newly discovered temperate forest tree, *Sylva nova*, and a fungus isolated from its native soil. To classify the symbiosis, the ecologist performs both structural and functional analyses.\n\nFor the structural analysis, fine roots of *Sylva nova* grown in the presence of the fungus are carefully excavated, fixed, cleared of their cytoplasm, and stained with a fungal-specific dye. Microscopic examination reveals that fungal hyphae penetrate the cell walls of the root's cortical cells, forming highly branched structures known as arbuscules within them. No evidence of a thick external fungal mantle encasing the root tips or an intercellular hyphal network (Hartig net) is found.\n\nFor the functional analysis, the ecologist quantifies the phosphorus-for-carbon trade-off. A \"Symbiotic Exchange Efficiency,\" $\\eta_{sym}$, is defined to compare different mycorrhizal types. This efficiency is the ratio of the relative increase in plant phosphorus uptake due to the fungus to the fractional carbon cost paid by the plant. The formula is:\n$$ \\eta_{sym} = \\frac{(P_M - P_{NM}) / P_{NM}}{C_{cost}} $$\nwhere:\n- $P_M$ is the phosphorus concentration in mycorrhizal plants.\n- $P_{NM}$ is the phosphorus concentration in non-mycorrhizal (control) plants.\n- $C_{cost}$ is the fraction of the plant's total photosynthetically fixed carbon that is transferred to the fungus.\n\nFrom a controlled growth experiment, the ecologist gathers the following data:\n- $P_M = 9.1$ mg of phosphorus per gram of dry plant tissue.\n- $P_{NM} = 3.2$ mg of phosphorus per gram of dry plant tissue.\n- $C_{cost} = 0.15$.\n\nGeneral physiological models indicate that Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) associations are characterized by highly efficient phosphorus uptake, typically yielding $\\eta_{sym}$ values greater than 10. In contrast, Ectomycorrhizal (EM) associations, which often invest heavily in extensive external mycelial networks, tend to have a different exchange economy, typically resulting in $\\eta_{sym}$ values less than 8.\n\nBased on both the structural observations and your calculation of the Symbiotic Exchange Efficiency, which of the following conclusions is the most strongly supported?\n\nA. The association is Ectomycorrhizal, because the structural evidence is ambiguous and the calculated $\\eta_{sym}$ is low.\n\nB. The association is Arbuscular Mycorrhizal, and the calculated $\\eta_{sym}$ is consistent with this classification.\n\nC. The association is Ectomycorrhizal, and the calculated $\\eta_{sym}$ is consistent with this classification.\n\nD. The association is Arbuscular Mycorrhizal, but the calculated $\\eta_{sym}$ contradicts this classification, suggesting an atypical symbiosis.\n\nE. The data is insufficient to distinguish between AM and EM associations, as the structural and functional evidence conflict.", "solution": "The problem requires a two-part analysis to determine the type of mycorrhizal association: first, an interpretation of the structural (microscopic) evidence, and second, a calculation and interpretation of the functional (metabolic) evidence.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structural description. The problem states that \"fungal hyphae penetrate the cell walls of the root's cortical cells, forming highly branched structures known as arbuscules within them.\" It also explicitly states that \"No evidence of a thick external fungal mantle ... or a Hartig net is found.\" The intracellular penetration to form arbuscules is the defining characteristic of an Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) association. The absence of a fungal mantle and a Hartig net (an intercellular network) effectively rules out an Ectomycorrhizal (EM) association. Therefore, the structural evidence strongly and unambiguously points to an AM symbiosis.\n\nSecond, let's perform the quantitative functional analysis by calculating the Symbiotic Exchange Efficiency, $\\eta_{sym}$. The formula provided is:\n$$ \\eta_{sym} = \\frac{(P_M - P_{NM}) / P_{NM}}{C_{cost}} $$\nThe problem provides the necessary values:\n- $P_M = 9.1 \\text{ mg/g}$\n- $P_{NM} = 3.2 \\text{ mg/g}$\n- $C_{cost} = 0.15$\n\nWe begin by calculating the numerator, which represents the relative increase in phosphorus uptake:\n$$ \\text{Relative P increase} = \\frac{P_M - P_{NM}}{P_{NM}} = \\frac{9.1 - 3.2}{3.2} = \\frac{5.9}{3.2} $$\nNow, we compute the value of this fraction:\n$$ \\frac{5.9}{3.2} = 1.84375 $$\nThis means the mycorrhizal association caused a 184.375% increase in the plant's phosphorus concentration compared to the non-mycorrhizal control.\n\nNext, we substitute this result back into the formula for $\\eta_{sym}$:\n$$ \\eta_{sym} = \\frac{1.84375}{C_{cost}} = \\frac{1.84375}{0.15} $$\nPerforming the final division gives the efficiency value:\n$$ \\eta_{sym} \\approx 12.29166... $$\nThe calculated value for $\\eta_{sym}$ is approximately 12.3.\n\nNow, we must interpret this value in the context provided. The problem states that AM associations typically yield $\\eta_{sym} > 10$, while EM associations typically result in $\\eta_{sym} < 8$. Our calculated value of $\\approx 12.3$ falls squarely within the range characteristic of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal associations.\n\nFinally, we synthesize both pieces of evidence. The structural analysis (presence of arbuscules, absence of a mantle/Hartig net) identifies the symbiosis as AM. The functional analysis (calculated $\\eta_{sym} \\approx 12.3$) provides quantitative support that is fully consistent with an AM classification. Both lines of evidence converge on the same conclusion.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n- A: Incorrect. The structural evidence is not ambiguous and points to AM. The calculated $\\eta_{sym}$ is high, not low.\n- B: Correct. The structural evidence indicates an AM association, and the calculated $\\eta_{sym}$ of ~12.3 is consistent with the typical range for AM associations ($\\eta_{sym} > 10$).\n- C: Incorrect. Both the structural and functional evidence contradict an EM classification.\n- D: Incorrect. The calculated $\\eta_{sym}$ *supports* the AM classification; it does not contradict it.\n- E: Incorrect. The structural and functional evidence are in complete agreement, not in conflict.\n\nTherefore, the most strongly supported conclusion is that the association is Arbuscular Mycorrhizal, with the functional data corroborating the structural findings.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1758398"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of any mutualism is an exchange of resources, and the legume-rhizobia symbiosis is a prime example of a complex metabolic partnership.
