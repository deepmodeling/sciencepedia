This exercise explores how the distribution and quality of resources can dictate the optimal mating strategy for both males and females. By analyzing a hypothetical scenario based on the well-established \"polygyny threshold model,\" you will deduce why resource-defense polygyny evolves when high-quality territories are limited and defensible [@problem_id:1755552].", "problem": "In a population of a hypothetical bird species, the Crimson-crested Reed-warbler, males establish and defend breeding territories along a riverbank. The quality of these territories varies significantly; some are resource-rich with abundant insect life and well-concealed nesting sites, while others are resource-poor and more exposed to predators. Extensive field studies have shown that a female's reproductive success (the number of chicks she successfully fledges) is almost entirely determined by the quality of the territory in which she nests, rather than any intrinsic quality of the male himself. Females survey multiple territories before selecting a mate. Given this strong selective pressure where female mate choice is driven primarily by the benefits of a high-quality territory, which of the following mating systems is most likely to evolve in the Crimson-crested Reed-warbler?\n\nA. Monogamy, where one male and one female form an exclusive pair bond for a breeding season.\n\nB. Resource-defense polygyny, where a single male mates with multiple females, all of whom nest within his high-quality territory.\n\nC. Polyandry, where a single female mates with multiple males.\n\nD. Lek polygyny, where males gather at a communal display area to attract females, but do not provide any territory or parental care.\n\nE. Serial monogamy, where individuals have only one partner at any one time, but have different partners in different breeding seasons.", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the fitness currency and causal driver. Let a female’s reproductive success be $F$, and let territory quality be $Q$. The problem states that $F$ is almost entirely a function of $Q$ and not of male intrinsic quality, so we write $F=F(Q)$ and assume $\\frac{dF}{dQ}0$.\n\nStep 2: Establish ecological preconditions. There is substantial spatial variation in $Q$ along the riverbank, and males establish and defend territories. Therefore, high-$Q$ patches are discrete, defendable resources that can be monopolized by males.\n\nStep 3: Female choice rule. Females survey multiple territories and choose locations that maximize $F(Q)$. If multiple females can obtain high $F(Q)$ within a single male’s defended area (i.e., the defended resource is sufficiently extensive or productive), then several females will select the same high-$Q$ territory even if it entails sharing a male.\n\nStep 4: Male fitness strategy. Because $F$ depends on $Q$ rather than male intrinsic traits, male reproductive success is maximized by acquiring and defending the highest-$Q$ territory that can accommodate multiple nesting females. This favors defense of resource-rich territories over other strategies (e.g., display arenas without resources).\n\nStep 5: Polygyny threshold logic. Let the fitness difference in moving from a lower-quality territory to a higher-quality territory be $\\Delta F=F(Q_{\\text{high}})-F(Q_{\\text{low}})$. Let the cost to a female of sharing a male (e.g., reduced male attention) be $C$. If $\\Delta FC$, a female gains higher $F$ by nesting in the high-$Q$ territory even if it is already occupied by another female. Given substantial $Q$ variation and female assessment, this inequality is likely to be met, leading multiple females to choose the same defended high-quality resource.\n\nStep 6: Predicted mating system. The combination of (i) defendable, heterogeneous resources, (ii) female fitness determined by resource quality, and (iii) female sampling and settlement on high-$Q$ sites, predicts resource-defense polygyny: males defend high-quality territories that attract and contain multiple nesting females.\n\nStep 7: Exclude alternatives.\n- A (Monogamy): More likely when resources are uniformly distributed or when biparental care is essential and cannot be shared; here, female fitness depends on $Q$ and high-$Q$ patches can attract multiple females.\n- C (Polyandry): Typically evolves when male-only care limits female reproductive rate or when females compete for males that provide care; not supported by resource-driven female fitness.\n- D (Lek polygyny): Arises when males cannot defend resources or provide parental care and females choose based on displays; contradicted by strong territory-quality effects on female fitness and defendable territories.\n- E (Serial monogamy): Describes partner turnover across seasons but does not capitalize on spatial heterogeneity in $Q$ within a season; it does not explain aggregation of multiple females on a single high-$Q$ territory.\n\nConclusion: The conditions match resource-defense polygyny.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1755552"}, {"introduction": "While conceptual models provide a framework, quantitative analysis allows us to make precise predictions about evolutionary tipping points. This problem challenges you to build a mathematical model to determine the exact conditions under which monogamy would become a more successful strategy than polyandry for a female shorebird. You will calculate the fitness trade-off between having more broods with lower survival versus one brood with higher survival, a core skill in evolutionary modeling [@problem_id:1755531].", "problem": "A species of shorebird, the Spotted Sandpiper (*Actitis macularius*), often exhibits a polyandrous mating system. In this system, a female may mate with multiple males during a single breeding season. A particularly successful female can lay a maximum of $N_{max} = 4$ clutches of eggs per season. After laying a clutch for one male, she leaves the eggs in his care (uniparental care) and attempts to find a new mate. The probability that she successfully finds a new, available male for each subsequent clutch is a constant, $p_m = 0.75$. The probability of a clutch surviving to fledge at least one chick under uniparental care is denoted by $S_u$.\n\nNow, consider a hypothetical ecological shift that makes an alternative strategy, monogamy, possible. In a monogamous pairing, a female and a male bond for the season. They collaborate to raise a single clutch of eggs. This biparental care is more effective, raising the clutch survival probability to $S_b$.\n\nFrom an evolutionary fitness perspective, natural selection will favor the mating strategy that maximizes the female's expected number of surviving clutches per season. Assume that any successful clutch, regardless of the mating system, produces the same average number of viable offspring.\n\nCalculate the minimum value of the survival probability ratio, $\\frac{S_b}{S_u}$, for which monogamy becomes the more evolutionarily advantageous strategy for a female.", "solution": "We compare the expected number of surviving clutches per season under polyandry (uniparental care) and monogamy (biparental care).\n\nUnder polyandry, the female can lay at most $N_{max}=4$ clutches. The first clutch is produced, and then each subsequent clutch occurs only if she finds a new mate, which happens independently with probability $p_{m}$ each time. Let $K$ be the number of clutches laid. Using indicator variables $I_{k}$ for the event “at least $k$ clutches are laid,” we have\n$$\nK=\\sum_{k=1}^{N_{max}} I_{k}, \\quad \\text{so} \\quad \\mathbb{E}[K]=\\sum_{k=1}^{N_{max}} \\mathbb{P}(I_{k}=1).\n$$\nWith the first clutch certain and each additional clutch requiring one successful mate-finding event, \n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(I_{1}=1)=1,\\quad \\mathbb{P}(I_{2}=1)=p_{m},\\quad \\mathbb{P}(I_{3}=1)=p_{m}^{2},\\quad \\mathbb{P}(I_{4}=1)=p_{m}^{3}.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[K]=1+p_{m}+p_{m}^{2}+p_{m}^{3}=\\sum_{i=0}^{N_{max}-1} p_{m}^{i}.\n$$\nEach laid clutch under uniparental care survives with probability $S_{u}$.

This exercise uses a game theory approach to find the stable equilibrium, or Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS), in a population where female fitness is a function of both male genetic quality and the amount of paternal care they receive. You will determine the proportion of females expected to adopt a polygynous strategy when its payoff is diluted by the number of competitors [@problem_id:1755555].", "problem": "In a hypothetical species of bird, the Gilded Flycatcher, a female's reproductive success is determined by the genetic quality of her mate and the total amount of care her offspring receive. The fitness, measured by the number of surviving offspring, is given by the product of the male's genetic quality factor and the total units of care (maternal plus paternal) provided to the nest.\n\nAll females provide a constant amount of maternal care, $M_c$. Males in the population are of two types: a large number of low-quality males and a smaller, limited number of high-quality males.\n\nA female has two reproductive strategies:\n1.  **Monogamy**: Mate with a low-quality male. The male is completely devoted to her nest, providing his full potential of parental care, $P_{max}$. Low-quality males have a genetic quality factor of $g_L$.\n2.  **Polygyny**: Attempt to mate with a high-quality male. High-quality males have a superior genetic quality factor, $g_H$. However, because they are sought after, they divide their parental care among all the females they mate with. Like low-quality males, their total potential for parental care is also $P_{max}$.\n\nConsider a large population of these birds where the ratio of the total number of females to the number of high-quality males is $R$.

All females pursuing the monogamous strategy can find an unmated low-quality male.\n\nAssuming a stable, mixed strategy exists in the female population, determine the proportion of females that will choose to mate with high-quality males.

The ratio of total females to high-quality males is $R$, so the number of females per high-quality male is $xR$.
