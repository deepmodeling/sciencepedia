This exercise explores this fundamental principle using the classic example of territoriality.

Fitness, in this context, is a measure of reproductive success. The total benefit gained from a territory of area $A$ is related to the amount of food and nesting sites it contains. This benefit, $B(A)$, is found to follow a saturation model:\n$$B(A) = \\frac{B_{\\text{max}} A}{K_A + A}$$\nwhere $B_{\\text{max}} = 120.0$ fitness units is the maximum possible benefit from an infinitely large territory, and $K_A = 2.00$ hectares is the half-saturation constant, representing the territory area at which the benefit is half of the maximum.\n\nThe total cost of maintaining the territory, $C(A)$, is primarily due to the energy expended in patrols and disputes with neighbors. This cost is modeled as being directly proportional to the area of the territory:\n$$C(A) = c A$$\nwhere the cost coefficient is $c = 5.00$ fitness units per hectare.\n\nThe net fitness, $F(A)$, of the warbler is the difference between the total benefit and the total cost.

This practice investigates the value of information through the fascinating phenomenon of eavesdropping, where one species intercepts another's signals to its own advantage. By quantitatively comparing a strategy based on eavesdropping with one based on random searching, you will see how access to a communication signal can drastically improve foraging success and, ultimately, an animal's fitness [@problem_id:1774804].", "problem": "In a study of interspecific competition and communication, biologists observe two insect species: the \"Sun-petal Bee\" and the \"Nectar Raider.\" The Nectar Raider is a poor forager but has evolved to exploit the behavior of the more efficient Sun-petal Bee.\n\nA Nectar Raider can adopt one of two foraging strategies for an entire 8.0-hour day:\n\n**Strategy 1: Random Foraging**\nWhen foraging on its own, a Nectar Raider finds a patch of flowers on average every 45 minutes. The probability that any randomly discovered patch is a \"rich patch\" is 15%. A rich patch provides a yield of 50 microliters of nectar. A non-rich patch provides a yield of 8.0 microliters of nectar.\n\n**Strategy 2: Eavesdropping**\nA Nectar Raider can wait near the nest of a Sun-petal Bee. Sun-petal Bees emit a specific \"rich-patch buzz\" upon returning to their nest after finding a high-yield nectar source. An eavesdropping Raider uses this signal. The average time a Raider must wait to detect one of these buzzes is 60 minutes. Once a buzz is detected, the Raider immediately attempts to follow the bee on its return flight to the patch. This follow-flight takes 10 minutes. The probability of successfully tracking the bee to the rich patch is 80%. A successful follow always leads to a rich patch, yielding 50 microliters of nectar. If the follow fails (a 20% chance), the Raider has wasted the 10-minute flight time, obtains 0 nectar, and must return to the nest to begin its wait again.\n\nCalculate the net difference in total nectar collected between a Raider that exclusively employs the eavesdropping strategy and one that exclusively employs the random foraging strategy.

Signalers can alter their messages depending on who is watching, a phenomenon known as the \"audience effect.\" This final practice challenges you to think like an ethologist by interpreting experimental data to test for the presence of an audience effect, revealing the sophisticated, context-dependent nature of animal signaling [@problem_id:1774806].", "problem": "An ethologist is investigating the \"audience effect\" in male Siamese fighting fish (*Betta splendens*). The audience effect refers to the phenomenon where individuals alter their signaling behavior depending on the presence and identity of observers. The experiment is designed to test if a male betta alters its agonistic (aggressive) display towards a rival male when a female is present as an audience.\n\nThe researcher uses a central tank for a focal male and two smaller, transparent, and sealed containers that can be placed adjacent to the main tank. One container holds a \"rival\" male, and the other holds a \"female\" conspecific. The focal male's behavior is recorded for a 5-minute period under four different experimental conditions:\n\n*   **Condition A (Control):** The focal male is alone in its tank with no other fish visible.\n*   **Condition B (Rival Only):** The container with the rival male is placed next to the focal male's tank.\n*   **Condition C (Rival + Female Audience):** The container with the rival male and the container with the female are both placed next to the focal male's tank, on opposite sides.\n*   **Condition D (Female Only):** The container with the female is placed next to the focal male's tank.\n\nTwo key agonistic behaviors are quantified: the total duration of opercular flaring (gill cover erection) in seconds, and the total frequency of tail beats. The mean results from multiple trials are summarized below:\n\n*   **Condition A:** Opercular Flaring = 5 seconds; Tail Beats = 8.\n*   **Condition B:** Opercular Flaring = 95 seconds; Tail Beats = 110.\n*   **Condition C:** Opercular Flaring = 225 seconds; Tail Beats = 250.\n*   **Condition D:** Opercular Flaring = 7 seconds; Tail Beats = 12.\n\nBased on these results, which of the following is the most accurate conclusion about the social behavior of male *Betta splendens*?\n\nA. The presence of a female is the sole trigger for agonistic displays in male betta fish.\n\nB. The presence of a rival male is a sufficient and necessary condition for achieving the maximum intensity of agonistic displays.\n\nC. The data provide evidence for an audience effect, where males intensify their agonistic displays towards rivals when a female audience is present.\n\nD. Male betta fish are unable to behaviorally distinguish between male rivals and potential female mates.\n\nE. The intensity of agonistic displays is a random behavior that is not systematically influenced by the social context.", "solution": "We evaluate how social context modulates agonistic displays by comparing the focal male’s behavior across the four conditions.\n\nFirst, establish the baseline. In Condition A (control), both opercular flaring and tail beats are low (5 seconds; 8), indicating minimal spontaneous agonistic behavior without social stimuli.\n\nSecond, test the effect of a rival male. In Condition B (rival only), both measures increase sharply (95 seconds; 110), demonstrating that the presence of a rival is sufficient to elicit strong agonistic displays relative to baseline.\n\nThird, test the effect of a female alone. In Condition D (female only), behavior remains near baseline (7 seconds; 12), showing that a female by herself does not trigger strong agonistic displays. This directly contradicts the claim that a female is the sole trigger, and it shows males can behaviorally distinguish between rivals and females.\n\nFourth, test whether a female audience modulates responses to a rival. In Condition C (rival plus female audience), both measures rise to their highest levels (225 seconds; 250), exceeding the rival-only condition. This indicates that the presence of a female audience amplifies the male’s agonistic display towards a rival, consistent with an audience effect.\n\nNow assess each option:\n- A is false because a female alone does not elicit strong displays (Condition D near baseline).\n- B is false because a rival alone does not produce the maximum intensity; the maximum occurs when a female audience is also present (Condition C  Condition B), so the rival alone is not sufficient for the maximum.\n- C is supported: displays intensify in the presence of a rival when a female audience is present (Condition C  Condition B), evidencing an audience effect.\n- D is false because the fish show distinct responses to rival males versus females (B high vs. D near baseline).\n- E is false because display intensity systematically varies with social context (A  D ≈ baseline  B  C), not randomly.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that the data provide evidence for an audience effect whereby males intensify their agonistic displays toward rivals when a female audience is present.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1774806"}]}
