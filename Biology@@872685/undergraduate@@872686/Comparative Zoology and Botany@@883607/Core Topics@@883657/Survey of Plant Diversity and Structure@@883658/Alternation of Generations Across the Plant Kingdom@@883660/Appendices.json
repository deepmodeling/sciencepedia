This involves a cycle between a multicellular diploid ($2n$) sporophyte generation and a multicellular haploid ($n$) gametophyte generation. The ploidy level refers to the number of sets of chromosomes in a cell. Haploid cells ($n$) contain one set, while diploid cells ($2n$) contain two sets.\n\nConsider the life cycles of both angiosperms (flowering plants) and gymnosperms (e.g., conifers). Determine the ploidy level ($n$ or $2n$) for each of the following three structures, respectively:\n\n1.  A nucleus within the growing pollen tube of an angiosperm.\n2.

A nucleus within the growing pollen tube of an angiosperm is part of the male gametophyte (the pollen grain develops into the pollen tube). Both the tube (vegetative) nucleus and the generative/sperm nuclei are products of the haploid microspore and remain haploid. Therefore, the nucleus is $n$.\n\n2. An antipodal cell within the mature embryo sac of an angiosperm belongs to the female gametophyte (the embryo sac arises from mitoses of a single haploid megaspore). Thus all its cells (egg, synergids, antipodals, and the nuclei prior to fertilization) are haploid. Therefore, the antipodal cell is $n$.\n\n3. A cell from the seed coat of a mature pine seed (gymnosperm) is derived from the integument of the ovule, which is maternal sporophytic tissue. Sporophyte tissues are diploid. Therefore, the seed coat cell is $2n$.\n\nPutting these in order gives $n$, $n$, $2n$, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1728158"}, {"introduction": "Moving from seed plants, we now explore the life cycle of ferns, which showcases a fascinating intermediate step in plant evolution. Unlike the dependent gametophytes of seed plants, the fern gametophyte is often a distinct, free-living organism capable of photosynthesis. This problem [@problem_id:1728205] asks you to examine the characteristics of the fern gametophyte, known as a prothallus, connecting its haploid state to its structure and independent mode of nutrition.", "problem": "A botanist is examining the life cycle of a terrestrial fern from the phylum Pteridophyta. A soil sample collected from a moist, shaded area near mature fern sporophytes is cultured in a petri dish. After several weeks, a number of small, independent, heart-shaped structures, each approximately 5 mm in diameter, are observed. These structures are green, indicating the presence of chlorophyll, and are anchored to the growth medium by fine, root-like filaments known as rhizoids. Microscopic examination reveals the presence of both antheridia and archegonia on the ventral surface of these structures. Based on these characteristics, the structures are identified as fern prothalli (gametophytes).\n\nWhich one of the following statements correctly describes the ploidy level of the prothallus cells and the primary mode by which this organism acquires nutrients during its free-living stage, before the subsequent sporophyte generation becomes established and photosynthetically active?\n\nA. Haploid ($n$); it is photosynthetic, producing its own organic compounds, and absorbs water and inorganic minerals from the substrate via its rhizoids.\n\nB. Diploid ($2n$); it is photosynthetic, producing its own organic compounds, and absorbs water and inorganic minerals from the substrate via its rhizoids.\n\nC. Haploid ($n$); it is non-photosynthetic and derives all its nutrition from the energy reserves contained within the original spore from which it germinated.\n\nD. Diploid ($2n$); it grows from the fertilized egg and is initially nourished by the gametophyte tissue before developing its own photosynthetic capacity.\n\nE. Haploid ($n$); it is a saprophyte, obtaining all its required organic nutrients by secreting enzymes to decompose dead organic matter in the substrate.", "solution": "First, identify the observed structures. The description of small, independent, green, heart-shaped bodies with rhizoids and bearing both antheridia and archegonia on the ventral surface clearly identifies them as fern prothalli, which are the free-living gametophytes of ferns.\n\nNext, determine the ploidy of the prothallus. In the fern life cycle, the gametophyte develops from a spore produced by meiosis on the sporophyte. Because spores are meiotic products, each spore is haploid, and the gametophyte that develops from it is also haploid. Therefore, all somatic cells of the prothallus are haploid ($n$).\n\nThen, determine the nutritional mode of the prothallus. The prothallus is explicitly described as green, indicating the presence of chlorophyll. Green fern gametophytes are photosynthetic and thus autotrophic for organic carbon, producing their own organic compounds via photosynthesis. They lack true roots and vascular tissue; instead, they possess rhizoids that anchor the gametophyte and absorb water and inorganic minerals from the substrate. Hence, during its free-living stage before the sporophyte is established, a typical green prothallus obtains water and minerals via rhizoids and synthesizes organic nutrients by photosynthesis.\n\nFinally, evaluate the options:\n- Option A states haploid and photosynthetic with water and mineral uptake via rhizoids, which matches the biology of a green fern gametophyte.\n- Option B is incorrect because the prothallus is not diploid.\n- Option C is incorrect because a green prothallus is photosynthetic; while some fern gametophytes can be non-photosynthetic and mycoheterotrophic, that does not match the described green, chlorophyll-bearing form.\n- Option D describes the diploid sporophyte nourished initially by the gametophyte; this does not apply to the prothallus itself.\n- Option E is incorrect because a green prothallus is not a saprophyte; it is autotrophic.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1728205"}, {"introduction": "The principles governing alternation of generations are powerful tools for understanding plant evolution in action.

They identify two distinct parent species, Fern A and Fern B. Both are typical diploid organisms whose somatic cells have a total of $2n$ chromosomes.

This hybrid grows into a mature sporophyte, but it is found to be sterile because its chromosomes from the two different parent species cannot form homologous pairs and segregate properly during meiosis.\n\nSubsequently, a somatic cell in this sterile hybrid undergoes a mitotic error known as endoreduplication, where the chromosomes replicate but the cell does not divide.
