This exercise challenges you to apply your knowledge of the chordate body plan and vertebrate diversity to a real-world scenario.

In its larval stage, known as an ammocoete, the organism is a blind, toothless, filter-feeder that burrows in the sandy sediment of freshwater streams. A dissection of this larval form reveals the presence of a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, and pharyngeal slits, but no true vertebrae. After several years, the larva undergoes a radical metamorphosis. The resulting adult form is often found in larger bodies of water, where it lives as an ectoparasite on larger fish. This adult possesses a circular, jawless mouth surrounded by a suctorial funnel, a skeleton made entirely of cartilage, and a series of paired gill pouches.\n\nBased on this detailed life history, to which of the following vertebrate classes does this organism belong?\n\nA. Chondrichthyes\n\nB. Osteichthyes\n\nC. Cephalochordata\n\nD. Petromyzontida\n\nE. Myxini", "solution": "We begin by matching the described larval and adult characteristics to major chordate and vertebrate groups.\n\nThe larval stage is explicitly an ammocoete: a blind, toothless, filter-feeding, burrowing larva in freshwater streams. It possesses a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, and pharyngeal slits, but no true vertebrae. The term “ammocoete” uniquely refers to lamprey larvae, which are characteristic of the cyclostome lineage Petromyzontida. Although the listed chordate features (notochord, dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits) are shared broadly across chordates, the specific ecology and morphology of the ammocoete larva (freshwater, sedentary, endobenthic filter-feeder) are diagnostic for lampreys and not found in Myxini (hagfishes), which lack an ammocoete stage and exhibit direct development.\n\nThe adult stage described is an ectoparasite on larger fish with a circular, jawless mouth surrounded by a suctorial funnel, a cartilaginous skeleton, and paired gill pouches. This constellation of traits precisely matches lampreys (Petromyzontida): jawless vertebrates with an oral disc used to attach to hosts, keratinized tooth-like structures on the oral disc and tongue, a cartilaginous skeleton, and typically seven pairs of gill pouches. The suctorial funnel and ectoparasitic habit are not features of Myxini, which are mostly scavengers/predators lacking an oral disc and typically marine; moreover, Myxini do not have the freshwater ammocoete larval stage.\n\nWe eliminate alternative options:\n- Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes like sharks and rays) possess jaws and paired fins; the organism is jawless and has a suctorial oral disc, which excludes this class.\n- Osteichthyes (bony fishes) have a bony endoskeleton and jaws; the organism is jawless with a cartilaginous skeleton and parasitic oral disc, excluding this class.\n- Cephalochordata (lancelets) are non-vertebrate chordates; they do not undergo a metamorphosis to an ectoparasitic adult with a suctorial funnel and are not vertebrates.\n- Myxini (hagfishes) are jawless but lack an ammocoete larval stage, are typically marine scavengers with slime glands, and do not have a suctorial funnel for ectoparasitism.\n\nTherefore, the organism belongs to Petromyzontida.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2284873"}, {"introduction": "Not all chordates retain their defining features throughout their lives. This problem delves into the fascinating world of urochordates (tunicates), whose adult forms often disguise their chordate ancestry. By predicting the adult morphology from a classic \"tadpole\" larva, you will explore the profound impact of metamorphosis on an animal's body plan and lifestyle, highlighting the concept that key evolutionary traits can be present only transiently during development [@problem_id:1762142].", "problem": "A marine biology student is analyzing a plankton sample and discovers a microscopic, free-swimming larval organism. Detailed examination reveals that the larva possesses all five key characteristics of the phylum Chordata: a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, a post-anal tail, and an endostyle. Through genetic sequencing, the student confirms that the organism belongs to the subphylum Urochordata. Assuming the organism follows the most common developmental pathway for this subphylum, which of the following statements best describes the morphology and lifestyle of its adult form?\n\nA. The adult will be a motile, fish-like organism that retains all five chordate features, actively preying on smaller organisms in the water column.\n\nB. The adult will remain a free-swimming, planktonic organism that retains its larval morphology and all five chordate features throughout its life, feeding on microorganisms.\n\nC. The adult will be a sessile, filter-feeding organism that has lost its notochord, post-anal tail, and dorsal nerve cord, but retains an enlarged pharynx with slits and an endostyle for feeding.\n\nD. The adult will be a burrowing, worm-like organism that retains its notochord and pharyngeal slits but loses its tail, using its muscular body to move through sediment.\n\nE. The adult will metamorphose into a free-swimming predator, where the notochord is replaced by a cartilaginous vertebral column and the pharyngeal slits develop into gill supports.", "solution": "We start from the given facts: the larva is confirmed to be a urochordate (tunicate) and exhibits all five chordate features in the larval stage: notochord, dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, post-anal tail, and endostyle.\n\nPrinciple of urochordate development: In the most common urochordate life history (e.g., ascidiaceans), the organism has a free-swimming, tadpole-like larva that disperses, then settles on a substrate and undergoes metamorphosis into a sessile adult. During this metamorphosis, the following morphological changes occur:\n- The notochord is resorbed and lost.\n- The post-anal tail is resorbed and lost.\n- The dorsal hollow nerve cord largely degenerates, with the adult retaining only a cerebral ganglion rather than a dorsal tubular nerve cord.\n- The pharynx enlarges to form a pharyngeal basket with numerous gill slits used for filter feeding.\n- The endostyle is retained and functions in mucus production to trap food particles during filter feeding.\n\nTherefore, the typical adult urochordate is a sessile filter feeder that has lost the notochord, tail, and dorsal hollow nerve cord, but retains and enlarges the pharyngeal apparatus with slits and keeps the endostyle.\n\nNow we evaluate each option against this established developmental pattern:\n- A: Describes a vertebrate-like, motile predator retaining all chordate features; this contradicts typical urochordate adult morphology.\n- B: States lifelong retention of larval morphology and all five chordate features; while some urochordates (appendicularians/larvaceans) retain a tail and remain planktonic, this is not the most common pathway and they do not retain all five features exactly as in the larva; thus this is incorrect for the “most common” case.\n- C: Matches the canonical ascidian adult: sessile, filter-feeding; loses notochord, tail, and dorsal nerve cord; retains enlarged pharynx with slits and an endostyle.\n- D: Describes a burrowing, worm-like organism retaining notochord and pharyngeal slits but losing tail; this better fits cephalochordates (and they do not lose the tail), not urochordates.\n- E: Describes evolution into a vertebrate with a vertebral column and gill supports; this is not urochordate development.\n\nHence, the correct choice is the description of a sessile, filter-feeding adult retaining the pharyngeal basket and endostyle while losing the notochord, tail, and dorsal nerve cord.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1762142"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the evolutionary history of chordates requires us to interpret the fossil record. This exercise places you in the role of a paleontologist who has discovered a puzzling Cambrian fossil, forcing you to use the principle of parsimony—the idea that the simplest evolutionary explanation is often the best one. By evaluating a mosaic of primitive and derived features, you will practice constructing a phylogenetic argument, a core skill in tracing the deep evolutionary origins of major animal groups like our own [@problem_id:1762134].", "problem": "A paleontologist examining Cambrian shale deposits discovers a remarkably well-preserved fossil of a small, sessile, marine organism, which is named *Palaeotunicatus ambiguus*. The organism's anatomy, discernible from the impression, reveals a complex pharyngeal basket with numerous gill-like slits and a distinct, unsegmented, flexible rod running along its dorsal side, consistent in position and morphology with a notochord. However, there is no evidence of a cranium, vertebrae, or a post-anal tail.\n\nFor context, the three major subphyla of Chordata are:\n-   **Urochordata (Tunicates):** Typically sessile as adults, possessing a large pharyngeal basket but lacking a notochord and post-anal tail. Their free-swimming larvae, however, possess all the classic chordate features.\n-   **Cephalochordata (Lancelets):** Small, fish-like filter-feeders that retain the notochord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail throughout their life.\n-   **Vertebrata/Craniata:** Characterized by a cranium, a vertebral column (which typically replaces the notochord in adults), and a post-anal tail.\n\nBased on the combination of features present and absent in *Palaeotunicatus ambiguus*, which of the following phylogenetic placements is the most parsimonious and best supported by the evidence?\n\nA. As a basal chordate that diverged before the evolution of the post-anal tail, making it a sister taxon to all other known chordates (Urochordata + Cephalochordata + Vertebrata).\n\nB. As a stem-group Urochordate, representing a lineage that diverged after Cephalochordata but before the emergence of modern tunicates.\n\nC. As a stem-group Cephalochordate that secondarily lost its post-anal tail.\n\nD. As a stem-group Vertebrate that diverged before the evolution of the cranium and secondarily lost its post-anal tail.\n\nE. As a member of the Phylum Hemichordata, with the rod-like structure being a convergent evolution of a notochord (i.e., not a true notochord).", "solution": "First, identify the character states preserved in the fossil. The specimen is sessile and has a large pharyngeal basket with numerous gill-like slits; these are hallmark features of tunicate adults. It also shows a distinct, unsegmented, flexible dorsal rod consistent with a notochord. There is no evidence of a cranium, vertebrae, or a post-anal tail.\n\nNext, use these characters to exclude placements inconsistent with the observed combination:\n1) Vertebrata/Craniata can be rejected because the absence of a cranium and vertebrae contradicts the defining features of this clade; furthermore, a sessile habit is highly inconsistent with stem vertebrate ecology. Thus option D is not supported and would require multiple ad hoc losses (cranium and tail) and a major ecological shift, making it unparsimonious.\n2) Hemichordata can be rejected because, although hemichordates can be sessile (pterobranchs) and possess pharyngeal slits, they lack a true notochord. Their stomochord is an anterior structure and not a continuous dorsal axial rod. Interpreting the clearly dorsal, axial, notochord-like structure as a convergence would add an extra, unlikely homoplasy. Therefore option E is less parsimonious than accepting the structure as a true notochord within Chordata.\n3) Cephalochordata are small, fish-like, and retain a post-anal tail and notochord throughout life; they are not sessile. Explaining a sessile, tailless form as a stem cephalochordate requires at least two major, independent changes (loss of the post-anal tail and a shift to sessility), while also failing to explain the large, tunicate-like pharyngeal basket. Hence option C is less parsimonious.\n\nNow evaluate the remaining chordate placements in light of parsimony and known chordate character distributions:\n4) A basal chordate lacking a post-anal tail (option A) would imply that the post-anal tail evolved after this lineage diverged, requiring the tail to be gained in both cephalochordates and the lineage leading to tunicate larvae and vertebrates. However, the post-anal tail is widely considered a chordate synapomorphy, present in cephalochordates, vertebrates, and tunicate larvae. It is more parsimonious that the tail was ancestrally present and lost in adult tunicates, rather than absent at the base of Chordata and gained multiple times. Therefore A is disfavored.\n5) A stem-group urochordate (option B) best matches the mosaic of features: a sessile adult with a large pharyngeal basket and no post-anal tail (tunicate-like), combined with the presence of a notochord (a plesiomorphic chordate feature). This scenario requires only a single subsequent shift within crown tunicates: restriction of the notochord to the larval stage and the loss of the adult tail, both of which characterize modern tunicates. It does not require convergence of a notochord-like structure or multiple independent gains/losses of the post-anal tail across major chordate lineages.\n\nBy the principle of parsimony—minimizing the number of character state changes—the most economical and evidentially consistent placement is as a stem-group urochordate. Therefore the best-supported choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1762134"}]}
