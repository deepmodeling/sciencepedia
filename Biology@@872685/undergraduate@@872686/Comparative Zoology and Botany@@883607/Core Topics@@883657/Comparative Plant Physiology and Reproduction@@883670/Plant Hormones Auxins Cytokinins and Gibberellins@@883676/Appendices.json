This thought experiment, based on a classic laboratory demonstration known as the Richmond-Lang effect, allows us to visualize this process in a controlled way. By considering a detached leaf, we can isolate the direct effect of applying cytokinin to one half while the other half serves as a control, revealing the hormone's power to maintain cellular health and chlorophyll content. [@problem_id:1765066]", "problem": "A botany student conducts an experiment on a single, healthy, mature spinach leaf recently detached from the plant. The student carefully applies a thin, waterproof, inert barrier along the entire length of the leaf's central midrib, effectively isolating the two halves. The student then paints the top surface of one half of the leaf with a solution containing a synthetic cytokinin (kinetin). The other half is painted with an identical solution that lacks the cytokinin, serving as a control. The entire leaf is then placed on a moist filter paper inside a sealed, light-proof container and is kept at room temperature for two weeks.\n\nAssuming the leaf does not desiccate or become infected by microbes, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected visual state of the leaf after the two-week period?\n\nA. The half treated with cytokinin will be yellow and withered, while the untreated control half will remain green.\n\nB. The half treated with cytokinin will remain largely green, while the untreated control half will turn yellow.\n\nC. Both halves of the leaf will turn yellow at approximately the same rate.\n\nD. The half treated with cytokinin will develop numerous small, adventitious roots.\n\nE. The half treated with cytokinin will show a noticeable increase in surface area compared to the control half.", "solution": "The experimental design isolates two halves of a detached, mature spinach leaf by placing a waterproof barrier along the midrib, preventing vascular and apoplastic exchange between halves. One half receives exogenous cytokinin (kinetin) on the upper surface; the other half receives a cytokinin-free control solution. The leaf is kept moist, sealed, and in complete darkness at room temperature for two weeks, so it does not desiccate and is not photosynthesizing.\n\nPrinciple of leaf senescence: Once detached from the plant and kept in darkness, a mature leaf undergoes senescence. Key features include degradation of chlorophyll and proteins, leading to visible yellowing. In intact plants, endogenous cytokinins synthesized primarily in roots and transported via xylem delay senescence. In a detached leaf deprived of that source, senescence proceeds unless counteracted by exogenous cytokinin.\n\nCytokinin action (Richmond-Lang effect): Exogenous cytokinins delay senescence by maintaining chlorophyll and protein content, stabilizing photosynthetic apparatus, and mobilizing nutrients to treated tissue. This results in retention of green coloration in treated regions compared to untreated regions under identical stress conditions (darkness and detachment).\n\nRole of the midrib barrier: The waterproof barrier prevents lateral movement of the applied cytokinin across the midrib, ensuring that any effect remains confined to the treated half and does not rescue the control half.\n\nPredictions and evaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because cytokinin does not promote yellowing; it retards senescence.\n- B is correct: the cytokinin-treated half will remain largely green (delayed senescence), while the untreated control half will yellow due to senescence in darkness.\n- C is incorrect because the differential presence of cytokinin will produce different senescence rates.\n- D is incorrect: adventitious root formation is promoted by auxin, not cytokinin, and a mature leaf blade in darkness would not develop numerous roots from cytokinin application.\n- E is incorrect: cytokinins primarily promote cell division in meristematic tissues and delay senescence; they do not appreciably increase the surface area of a mature leaf half, especially in darkness where growth is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate expected visual outcome is that the cytokinin-treated half remains largely green while the untreated half turns yellow.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1765066"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand how hormones orchestrate plant development, we must look beyond their observable effects and examine the molecular machinery that allows cells to perceive them. This problem challenges you to think like a geneticist by predicting the large-scale, whole-plant consequences of a single molecular defect: a non-functional auxin receptor. By reasoning through the loss of auxin perception, you can solidify your understanding of this hormone's central roles in maintaining apical dominance and initiating adventitious roots. [@problem_id:1765069]", "problem": "A plant biologist is studying the genetic basis of plant architecture. They discover a novel mutant strain of a common herbaceous plant. Through molecular analysis, they determine that this mutant possesses a single gene defect that results in the synthesis of a non-functional auxin receptor protein. This defective receptor is expressed in all tissues where the wild-type receptor would normally be found, but it is completely unable to bind to its ligand, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the primary native auxin.\n\nAssuming all other hormone signaling pathways (e.g., for cytokinins and gibberellins) are initially normal, which of the following phenotypes is most likely to be observed in this mutant plant compared to its wild-type counterpart?\n\nA. Enhanced apical dominance, leading to a taller, less branched plant, and a significant increase in adventitious root formation on stem cuttings.\n\nB. A complete loss of apical dominance, resulting in a bushy, highly branched phenotype, and a severe impairment of adventitious root formation on stem cuttings.\n\nC. A dwarf phenotype with shortened internodes, but with normal apical dominance and normal adventitious root formation.\n\nD. Excessive elongation of the main stem, a loss of apical dominance, but with a normal capacity for adventitious root formation.\n\nE. Enhanced apical dominance, but a complete inability to form adventitious roots on stem cuttings.", "solution": "The mutant expresses a non-functional auxin receptor in all tissues, which cannot bind indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Hormone action requires ligand-receptor binding to initiate signal transduction; therefore, if the receptor cannot bind IAA, auxin signaling is effectively abolished throughout the plant.\n\nAuxin’s major roles relevant here include:\n1) Maintenance of apical dominance: In wild-type shoots, auxin produced by the apical meristem moves basipetally and suppresses axillary bud outgrowth, in part via interactions that promote strigolactone signaling and suppress cytokinin effects in buds. If auxin cannot be perceived, this inhibitory signal fails in axillary buds and stem tissues, leading to loss of apical dominance and increased lateral branching (a bushy phenotype).\n\n2) Adventitious root formation: Auxin is necessary and typically sufficient to induce adventitious root initiation on stem cuttings. Without auxin perception, the transcriptional and cellular programs for root initiation cannot be activated, resulting in severely impaired adventitious root formation.\n\n3) Stem elongation: Auxin promotes cell elongation via the acid growth mechanism and auxin-responsive gene expression. Loss of auxin signaling generally reduces elongation (dwarfing). Although this aspect is not required to select among the options, it helps eliminate choices that propose excessive elongation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A and E (enhanced apical dominance) require heightened auxin signaling or sensitivity, which contradicts a null auxin perception state.\n- D (excessive elongation and normal rooting) contradicts the expected reduction in elongation and the required role of auxin in adventitious rooting.\n- C includes dwarfism but incorrectly claims normal apical dominance and rooting, both of which require auxin perception.\n- B correctly predicts loss of apical dominance (bushy, highly branched) and severely impaired adventitious root formation, matching the consequences of a global loss of auxin signaling.\n\nTherefore, B is the most consistent phenotype.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1765069"}, {"introduction": "Plant science often moves from qualitative observation to quantitative prediction. While we know auxin promotes cell elongation, this advanced problem challenges you to model this process with mathematical precision using the famous Lockhart equation for cell wall expansion. You will integrate the dynamic, time-dependent effects of an auxin pulse on key biophysical parameters—wall extensibility ($\\phi$) and yield threshold ($Y$). Mastering this exercise bridges the gap between abstract hormonal concepts and the concrete physics governing plant growth.
