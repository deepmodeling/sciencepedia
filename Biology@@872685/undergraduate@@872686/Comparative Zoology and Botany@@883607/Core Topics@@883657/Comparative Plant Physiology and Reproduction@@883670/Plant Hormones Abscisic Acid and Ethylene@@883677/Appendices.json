In this practice, you will act as a plant biologist presented with a mystery mutant. By carefully analyzing its unique characteristics—from seedling development to fruit ripening—you can piece together the evidence to diagnose the specific hormonal imbalance at play, highlighting the distinct and varied roles of ethylene [@problem_id:1764820].", "problem": "A team of botanists is investigating a novel tomato plant variant, designated `mutant-X`. To characterize its phenotype, they conduct a series of comparative experiments against a standard wild-type (WT) tomato plant. Their collected observations are as follows:\n\n1.  When seeds were germinated and grown in complete darkness for one week, `mutant-X` seedlings were significantly shorter and thicker, and displayed a more pronounced curvature of the apical hook compared to the elongated, thin WT seedlings.\n2.  In mature, well-watered plants grown under normal light conditions, the lower leaves of `mutant-X` began to yellow and fall off approximately two weeks earlier than those of WT plants.\n3.  Fruits from `mutant-X` plants, when harvested at the same mature green stage as WT fruits, consistently began to soften and turn red in half the time required for WT fruits.\n4.  When both `mutant-X` and WT plants were subjected to a controlled drought by withholding water, microscopic analysis revealed that the stomata on the leaves of `mutant-X` plants closed, and the plants began to wilt at a rate indistinguishable from the WT plants.\n\nBased on these four observations, which of the following is the most plausible molecular-genetic basis for the `mutant-X` phenotype?\n\nA. `mutant-X` possesses a mutation that renders its cells insensitive to Abscisic Acid (ABA).\n\nB. `mutant-X` possesses a mutation causing constitutive overproduction of the hormone ethylene.\n\nC. `mutant-X` possesses a mutation that blocks the synthesis of Abscisic Acid (ABA).\n\nD. `mutant-X` possesses a mutation that renders its cells insensitive to the hormone ethylene.\n\nE. `mutant-X` possesses a mutation causing constitutive overproduction of Abscisic Acid (ABA).", "solution": "I proceed by matching each observation to known hormone-regulated physiological responses, using established principles of plant hormone action, and then intersecting the implications to identify a single mutation consistent with all four observations.\n\nFirst, in dark-grown seedlings, ethylene elicits the classical triple response, which consists of: (i) reduced hypocotyl and root elongation (shorter seedlings), (ii) increased radial swelling (thicker hypocotyl), and (iii) exaggerated apical hook curvature. Observation 1 reports that in complete darkness mutant-X seedlings are significantly shorter and thicker and display a more pronounced apical hook than wild type. This matches the ethylene triple response and thus indicates elevated ethylene signaling in mutant-X in the dark. This is consistent with constitutive ethylene overproduction or constitutive ethylene signaling, and is inconsistent with ethylene insensitivity (which would abolish the triple response and typically yield elongated, less curved seedlings). It is not characteristic of Abscisic Acid (ABA) action, which does not produce the triple response.\n\nSecond, ethylene promotes leaf senescence and abscission. Observation 2 states that under normal light and adequate water, lower leaves in mutant-X yellow and drop approximately two weeks earlier than wild type. This is characteristic of elevated ethylene signaling and inconsistent with ethylene insensitivity, which would delay senescence and abscission. ABA is primarily associated with stress responses (especially stomatal regulation) and seed dormancy; constitutive ABA effects would more directly impact stomatal behavior and growth under non-stress conditions rather than specifically causing premature abscission in well-watered plants.\n\nThird, ethylene is the key regulator of climacteric fruit ripening such as in tomato; increased ethylene accelerates softening and color change, while ethylene insensitivity delays or prevents ripening. Observation 3 reports that mutant-X fruits ripen in half the time of wild type when harvested at the same mature green stage, which is a hallmark of elevated ethylene signaling and contradicts ethylene insensitivity. ABA is not the primary driver of climacteric ripening in tomato.\n\nFourth, ABA mediates stomatal closure under drought; ABA-deficient mutants (blocked synthesis) or ABA-insensitive mutants fail to close stomata properly and show altered wilting dynamics compared to wild type when water is withheld. Observation 4 states that under controlled drought, mutant-X stomata close and plants wilt at rates indistinguishable from wild type. This indicates normal ABA biosynthesis and signaling, thereby excluding both ABA insensitivity and ABA biosynthetic blockade. Constitutive ABA overproduction would be expected to alter stomatal behavior even in the absence of drought (e.g., increased closure at baseline) and could change drought response kinetics, which is not observed.\n\nIntegrating all four observations:\n- The dark-grown seedling morphology (short, thick, exaggerated hook), premature senescence/abscission, and accelerated climacteric fruit ripening each specifically support elevated ethylene signaling.\n- The normal drought-induced stomatal closure excludes defects in ABA signaling or synthesis and argues against constitutive ABA overproduction altering stomatal behavior.\n\nAmong the provided options, only a mutation causing constitutive overproduction of ethylene explains all observations while remaining consistent with the normal ABA-dependent drought response.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1764820"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond observing hormone effects, this exercise delves into the specific molecular machinery that drives them. Here, we consider a plant engineered with a permanently active component of the Abscisic Acid (ABA) signaling pathway, the SnRK2 kinase. Your task is to predict the whole-plant consequences of this targeted molecular intervention, a challenge that tests your understanding of how internal signaling cascades translate into organism-level traits like growth and stress response [@problem_id:1764782].", "problem": "Plant scientists are investigating strategies to enhance drought tolerance in crops by manipulating the signaling pathway of the phytohormone Abscisic Acid (ABA). ABA is a key regulator of plant responses to water deficit, primarily by inducing stomatal closure to reduce water loss and by inhibiting growth. A central component of the ABA signaling cascade is a family of protein kinases known as SNF1-related protein kinases 2 (SnRK2s). In a non-stressed plant, SnRK2s are kept in an inactive state. Upon perception of ABA, which increases during drought, SnRK2s become activated and phosphorylate numerous downstream targets that execute the drought-response program.\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment where a genetically engineered line of a model plant is created. This line expresses a \"constitutively active\" version of a key SnRK2 kinase. This modification means the kinase is perpetually active, regardless of the plant's internal ABA concentration. The engineered plants and unmodified wild-type plants are grown side-by-side.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the observable phenotypes of the engineered plant, specifically concerning its overall growth (measured as shoot biomass accumulation) and stomatal behavior, when compared to the wild-type plant under both well-watered and mild drought conditions?\n\nA. Compared to the wild-type, the engineered plant will show significantly reduced growth and a higher proportion of closed stomata under well-watered conditions. When subjected to mild drought, its phenotype will change little, thus appearing more water-conserving than the wild-type but at the cost of persistently low growth.\n\nB. The engineered plant will exhibit enhanced growth under both well-watered and mild drought conditions because the constant stress signal primes the plant for more efficient resource utilization.\n\nC. The engineered plant will grow normally under well-watered conditions, but will demonstrate a superiorly rapid and complete stomatal closure response upon the onset of mild drought, resulting in better overall performance than the wild-type.\n\nD. Under all conditions, the engineered plant will have larger stomatal apertures and will wilt more quickly than the wild-type, because the constant activity of SnRK2 leads to a desensitization of the entire ABA signaling pathway.\n\nE. The engineered plant will exhibit a dwarf phenotype with closed stomata under well-watered conditions, but upon exposure to mild drought, it will reverse this phenotype, opening its stomata to try and boost photosynthesis for survival.", "solution": "Abscisic acid signaling in drought operates through ABA perception by PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, inhibition of clade A PP2C phosphatases, and consequent activation of SnRK2 kinases. Active SnRK2s phosphorylate guard cell ion channels and downstream transcriptional regulators, leading to stomatal closure and growth suppression. In non-stressed plants with low ABA, PP2Cs keep SnRK2s inactive; thus stomata remain more open and growth proceeds.\n\nEngineering a constitutively active SnRK2 bypasses the ABA requirement and PP2C control, locking the pathway in an “ABA-on” state regardless of water status. Therefore:\n- Under well-watered conditions, the engineered plant will display ABA-like responses: increased stomatal closure reduces transpiration and CO₂ uptake, lowering photosynthesis and shoot biomass accumulation; growth-inhibitory transcriptional programs are active, further reducing growth.\n- Under mild drought, the wild-type will increase ABA and activate SnRK2s to close stomata and slow growth, but the engineered plant is already in this state. Hence its phenotype will change little with drought compared to its well-watered state. Relative to wild-type under mild drought, it will appear more water-conserving due to already-closed stomata but will continue to pay a growth penalty.\n\nThese predictions match option A and contradict the others: B is incorrect because ABA/SnRK2 activation suppresses growth rather than enhancing it; C is incorrect because growth would not be normal under well-watered conditions if SnRK2 is constitutively active; D is incorrect because constitutive downstream kinase activity does not cause larger stomatal apertures or desensitization that reverses the closure signal; E is incorrect because there is no mechanistic basis for a switch to stomatal opening upon drought with constitutive SnRK2 activity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1764782"}, {"introduction": "Plant survival and development depend on the dynamic interplay between different hormone pathways.
