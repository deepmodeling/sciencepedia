Correctly identifying this pathway is essential for grasping the cellular basis of double fertilization and subsequent seed formation.", "problem": "In the vast majority of flowering plants (angiosperms), the development of the female gametophyte, or embryo sac, follows a specific and highly regulated pattern known as the *Polygonum*-type. This process begins with a single specialized diploid cell within the ovule, the Megaspore Mother Cell (MMC), and culminates in a multicellular structure ready for fertilization.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately and completely describes the sequence of meiotic and mitotic events, as well as the fate of the resulting cells and nuclei, during the formation of a single, mature *Polygonum*-type embryo sac from one MMC?\n\nA. One meiotic division is followed by three mitotic divisions, resulting in a seven-celled, eight-nucleate structure where the large central cell contains only one haploid nucleus.\n\nB. One meiotic division produces four haploid megaspores. All four megaspores remain functional and undergo one round of mitosis each to collectively contribute the eight nuclei to the final embryo sac.\n\nC. The Megaspore Mother Cell undergoes three successive mitotic divisions to create the eight-nucleate embryo sac. This structure is then fertilized by a diploid sperm nucleus from the pollen tube.\n\nD. One meiotic division produces four haploid megaspores, three of which degenerate. The remaining functional megaspore undergoes three rounds of mitosis, ultimately forming a mature structure containing seven cells and eight haploid nuclei.\n\nE. One meiotic division and two subsequent mitotic divisions occur from the functional megaspore, producing a four-nucleate embryo sac that cellularizes into an egg cell, two synergids, and one large central cell.", "solution": "The Megaspore Mother Cell (MMC) is diploid, denoted $2n$. In the Polygonum-type development, the MMC undergoes meiosis (a single meiotic event comprising two successive divisions), yielding a linear tetrad of four haploid megaspores, each $n$. Of these four megaspores, three degenerate and only one remains functional (typically the chalazal-most). This satisfies the monosporic condition.\n\nThe single functional megaspore (haploid, $n$) then undergoes three successive mitotic divisions without immediate cytokinesis. Each mitotic division doubles the number of nuclei, so starting from $1$ nucleus, after three rounds there are $2^{3}=8$ haploid nuclei distributed within a common cytoplasm.\n\nThese $8$ nuclei are arranged such that $4$ migrate toward the micropylar end and $4$ toward the chalazal end; then one nucleus from each pole migrates to the center, forming two polar nuclei within the large central cell. The remaining nuclei differentiate into cells upon cellularization: at the micropylar end, the egg apparatus comprises one egg cell and two synergids; at the chalazal end, three antipodal cells are formed. Thus, the mature embryo sac is seven-celled and eight-nucleate, with the central cell containing two haploid polar nuclei (which may fuse to form a diploid secondary nucleus prior to fertilization).\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the central cell does not contain only one haploid nucleus; it contains two polar nuclei before fusion.\n- B is incorrect because in the Polygonum-type only one megaspore is functional; three degenerate.\n- C is incorrect because it omits meiosis and incorrectly states fertilization by a diploid sperm nucleus; sperm nuclei are haploid.\n- D correctly states that meiosis produces four haploid megaspores with three degenerating, and that the remaining functional megaspore undergoes three mitotic divisions to yield a seven-celled, eight-nucleate embryo sac.\n- E is incorrect because only two mitotic divisions would yield $4$ nuclei, not the characteristic $8$ of the mature Polygonum-type sac.\n\nTherefore, the correct and complete description is given by option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1764552"}, {"introduction": "Following fertilization, the developing embryo requires nourishment, which is provided by specialized tissues within the seed. This problem explores the genetic and developmental origins of two distinct nutritive tissues: the endosperm and the perisperm [@problem_id:1764535]. By comparing their ploidy levels and origins, you can deepen your understanding of the different strategies plants have evolved to provision their offspring.", "problem": "In certain angiosperm families, such as Chenopodiaceae (e.g., beets, quinoa) and Piperaceae (e.g., black pepper), the mature seed contains two distinct types of nutritive tissue. The first is the endosperm, which is common in most flowering plants. The second is the perisperm, a nutritive tissue that develops from the maternal nucellar tissue surrounding the embryo sac.\n\nConsider a diploid (2n) flowering plant that undergoes normal sexual reproduction through double fertilization. A seed produced by this plant contains both a persistent perisperm and a well-developed endosperm.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly contrasts the genetic origin and ploidy level of the perisperm and the endosperm found within this mature seed?\n\nA. The perisperm is diploid (2n) and genetically identical to the maternal parent, while the endosperm is triploid (3n) and contains genetic material from both the male and female parents.\n\nB. The perisperm is triploid (3n) and genetically identical to the maternal parent, while the endosperm is diploid (2n) and is a product of fertilization.\n\nC.

The perisperm is diploid (2n) and a product of fertilization, while the endosperm is triploid (3n) and is of purely maternal origin.\n\nE. Both the perisperm and the endosperm are triploid (3n), but the perisperm is of purely maternal origin while the endosperm contains genetic material from both parents.", "solution": "To determine the correct statement, we must analyze the developmental origin and resulting ploidy of both the perisperm and the endosperm, based on the life cycle of a typical diploid angiosperm.\n\nFirst, let's consider the perisperm. The problem states that the perisperm develops from the nucellus. The nucellus is part of the ovule, which is a structure of the parent sporophyte. Since the parent plant is diploid (2n), all of its somatic tissues, including the nucellus, are also diploid (2n). The perisperm is simply the proliferation of this maternal tissue without any genetic contribution from the male parent. Therefore, the perisperm is diploid (2n) and genetically identical to the mother plant.\n\nNext, let's analyze the endosperm. The endosperm is a product of the double fertilization process unique to angiosperms. In this process, two fertilization events occur within the embryo sac (the female gametophyte).\n1.  One male gamete (a sperm nucleus, which is haploid, n) fuses with the egg cell (also haploid, n) to form the zygote (diploid, 2n). The zygote develops into the embryo.\n2.  The second male gamete (sperm nucleus, haploid, n) fuses with the central cell of the embryo sac. The central cell typically contains two haploid polar nuclei (n + n).\n\nThe fusion of one haploid sperm nucleus (n) with the two haploid polar nuclei (n + n) results in the formation of the primary endosperm nucleus. The ploidy of this nucleus is the sum of the ploidies of the fusing nuclei: $n + (n + n) = 3n$. This primary endosperm nucleus then undergoes mitosis to develop into the endosperm tissue. Consequently, the endosperm is triploid (3n). Because it is formed from the fusion of a male gamete and female polar nuclei, the endosperm contains genetic material from both the male and female parents.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the given options:\n\nA. \"The perisperm is diploid (2n) and genetically identical to the maternal parent, while the endosperm is triploid (3n) and contains genetic material from both the male and female parents.\" This statement is consistent with our analysis. The perisperm is 2n and maternal. The endosperm is 3n and a product of fertilization involving both parents. This is the correct statement.\n\nB. \"The perisperm is triploid (3n) and genetically identical to the maternal parent, while the endosperm is diploid (2n) and is a product of fertilization.\" This incorrectly states the ploidy of both tissues.\n\nC. \"Both the perisperm and the endosperm are diploid (2n), but the perisperm is of purely maternal origin while the endosperm results from fertilization.\" This incorrectly states the ploidy of the endosperm.\n\nD. \"The perisperm is diploid (2n) and a product of fertilization, while the endosperm is triploid (3n) and is of purely maternal origin.\" This incorrectly describes the origin of both tissues. Perisperm does not result from fertilization, and endosperm is not purely maternal.\n\nE. \"Both the perisperm and the endosperm are triploid (3n), but the perisperm is of purely maternal origin while the endosperm contains genetic material from both parents.\" This incorrectly states the ploidy of the perisperm.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that accurately describes the origin and ploidy of both tissues is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1764535"}, {"introduction": "The development of a fruit from a flower is a complex process orchestrated by a network of regulatory genes. This practice challenges you to think like a developmental biologist, using the phenotype of a hypothetical fruit mutant to deduce the function of a key developmental gene [@problem_id:1764537]. Solving this requires applying your knowledge of MADS-box gene function to a practical problem in fruit tissue differentiation.", "problem": "A team of botanists studying apple (*Malus domestica*) cultivars discovers a new spontaneous mutant, which they name 'Petracarpa'. An apple is a pome, a type of accessory fruit where the fleshy part consumed is primarily derived from the floral hypanthium (the fused base of the sepals, petals, and stamens). The central core, which encloses the seeds, is derived from the ovary wall, which is composed of five fused carpels. In a standard wild-type apple, this carpel-derived core differentiates into two distinct tissues: an outer, somewhat fleshy layer (the mesocarp) and an inner, tough, cartilaginous layer (the endocarp) that directly surrounds the seed locules.\n\nIn the 'Petracarpa' mutant, the hypanthium-derived flesh appears completely normal in size, texture, and taste. However, the entire carpel-derived core develops into a single, uniformly hard, stone-like (lignified) structure, with no discernible boundary or difference in texture between the expected mesocarp and endocarp regions.\n\nFruit development and tissue differentiation in plants are largely controlled by the MADS-box family of transcription factors (named for four founding members: *MCM1*, *AGAMOUS*, *DEFICIENS*, and *SERUM RESPONSE FACTOR*). Specific clades of these genes orchestrate different aspects of fruit identity and maturation. For instance, in model plants, C-class genes like *AGAMOUS* (AG) specify carpel identity, while other MADS-box genes like *FRUITFULL* (FUL) and *SHATTERPROOF* (SHP) are known to function antagonistically to pattern the carpel wall, with FUL promoting fleshiness and repressing lignification, and SHP promoting lignification and dehiscence zone formation (the hardened pod-shattering layer in plants like *Arabidopsis*).\n\nBased on the described phenotype of the 'Petracarpa' mutant, which of the following genetic modifications is the most plausible underlying cause?\n\nA. A loss-of-function mutation in a *Malus domestica* gene that is a homolog of the *Arabidopsis* *FRUITFULL* (FUL) gene.\n\nB. A loss-of-function mutation in a *Malus domestica* gene that is a homolog of the *Arabidopsis* C-class gene *AGAMOUS* (AG).\n\nC. A gain-of-function mutation that causes ectopic expression of a hypanthium development gene within the carpel tissues.\n\nD. A loss-of-function mutation in a *Malus domestica* gene that is a homolog of the *Arabidopsis* B-class gene *APETALA3* (AP3).\n\nE. A loss-of-function mutation in the *Malus domestica* floral meristem identity gene that is a homolog of *Arabidopsis* *LEAFY* (LFY).", "solution": "We begin by mapping the described phenotype to known regulatory roles of MADS-box genes in carpel and fruit development. In the wild type, the carpel-derived core differentiates into two tissues: an outer, more fleshy mesocarp and an inner, lignified endocarp around the seed locules. In the mutant, the entire carpel-derived core is uniformly hard and lignified, with no boundary between mesocarp and endocarp, while the hypanthium-derived flesh is normal. Therefore, the defect is specific to carpel-wall patterning and lignification control, not to hypanthium identity or development.\n\nIn model plants, antagonistic roles are established: *FUL* promotes fleshy growth and represses lignification programs, whereas *SHP* promotes lignification and dehiscence-zone identity. A loss of *FUL* function is known to derepress *SHP*-like activities across the carpel wall, leading to ectopic and expanded lignification rather than a restricted endocarp layer. The observed uniform lignification of the entire carpel-derived core in the mutant is thus most consistent with reduced or absent *FUL* activity in the carpel tissues.\n\nWe now evaluate each option against these principles:\n\n- Option A (loss of function in a *FUL* homolog): This would remove repression of lignification programs in carpel tissues, allowing *SHP*-like factors to promote lignification broadly, converting what should be mesocarp plus endocarp into a uniformly hard, lignified structure. This directly matches the phenotype.\n\n- Option B (loss of function in *AG*): *AG* specifies carpel identity and floral determinacy. Loss of *AG* typically eliminates carpels and seeds and causes indeterminacy with reiterated perianth whorls; it would not produce a normal hypanthium with a lignified carpel-derived core. This contradicts the presence of a carpel-derived core and seeds.\n\n- Option C (gain of function: ectopic hypanthium gene in carpel): Hypanthium identity genes would be expected to promote fleshy accessory tissue characteristics, not a stone-like lignified core. Moreover, the hypanthium is reported as normal, making ectopic hypanthium identity in carpels unlikely to cause uniform lignification.\n\n- Option D (loss of function in *AP3*): *AP3* (a B-class gene) specifies petals and stamens. Its loss typically converts petals to sepals and stamens to carpels, but does not inherently reprogram carpel wall tissue toward uniform lignification. While organ identity changes could alter whorl composition, they do not explain the specific tissue-level shift to an entirely lignified carpel wall with loss of the mesocarp/endocarp boundary.\n\n- Option E (loss of function in *LFY*): *LFY* is a floral meristem identity gene; its loss severely impairs flower formation and thus fruit development, inconsistent with a normal hypanthium and a formed carpel-derived core.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is most parsimoniously explained by a loss-of-function mutation in a *FUL* homolog, leading to widespread derepression of lignification programs in the carpel wall and loss of proper mesocarp versus endocarp patterning.\n\nHence, the most plausible cause is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1764537"}]}
