This practice presents a classic thought experiment that vividly illustrates the pathways fluids take within these two designs [@problem_id:1729208]. By predicting the distribution of a dye in a grasshopper and an earthworm, you can build a clear mental model of contained versus uncontained flow, which is the defining feature separating these two major evolutionary strategies.", "problem": "An experimental zoologist is studying circulatory efficiency in invertebrates. The experiment involves two subjects: a common grasshopper (*Melanoplus femurrubrum*) and a common earthworm (*Lumbricus terrestris*). A small, fixed volume of a harmless, vibrant blue dye that is soluble in the circulatory fluid is carefully injected into the main dorsal vessel of each animal. The zoologist's objective is to observe the pattern of dye distribution throughout an organism's body a few minutes after the injection.\n\nAssuming both animals are healthy and their circulatory systems are functioning normally, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the observations?\n\nA. In both the grasshopper and the earthworm, the dye will be observed to remain entirely within a well-defined network of vessels, circulating rapidly from the dorsal vessel through smaller connecting vessels and back.\n\nB. In both the grasshopper and the earthworm, the dye will quickly exit the dorsal vessel and diffuse broadly into the main body cavity, directly bathing the internal organs in a blue-tinted fluid.\n\nC. In the grasshopper, the dye will remain confined to the dorsal vessel and a few branching arteries. In the earthworm, the dye will be pumped from the dorsal vessel into the general coelomic cavity, mixing with the coelomic fluid.\n\nD. In the grasshopper, the dye will be pumped out of the dorsal vessel into the main body cavity, slowly mixing with the fluid that bathes the tissues. In the earthworm, the dye will remain confined within the vascular network, moving from the dorsal vessel to the ventral vessel via connecting vessels.\n\nE. In the grasshopper, the dye rapidly perfuses all tissues via a dense capillary network. In the earthworm, the dye slowly percolates through the body cavity after being emptied from the dorsal vessel.", "solution": "The question asks to predict the distribution of a dye injected into the primary dorsal vessel of a grasshopper and an earthworm. To answer this, we must first identify the type of circulatory system present in each organism and understand its fundamental mechanism.\n\nStep 1: Identify the circulatory system of the grasshopper.\nThe grasshopper is an insect, a member of the Phylum Arthropoda. Arthropods possess an open circulatory system. In this type of system, the circulatory fluid, called hemolymph, is not always contained within vessels. A heart (or in the case of insects, a tube-like dorsal vessel) pumps the hemolymph through short vessels into a large, open body cavity known as the hemocoel. Within the hemocoel, the hemolymph directly bathes the tissues and organs, facilitating the exchange of nutrients and wastes. The hemolymph then slowly re-enters the dorsal vessel through small openings called ostia.\n\nStep 2: Predict the dye distribution in the grasshopper.\nWhen the dye is injected into the grasshopper's dorsal vessel, it will be mixed with the hemolymph. As the dorsal vessel pumps, it will expel this blue-tinted hemolymph into the hemocoel. Consequently, the dye will spread throughout the body cavity, directly surrounding the internal organs. This process is relatively slow and operates under low pressure.\n\nStep 3: Identify the circulatory system of the earthworm.\nThe earthworm is an annelid, a member of the Phylum Annelida. Annelids possess a closed circulatory system. In this system, the blood is always confined within a continuous network of vessels. The earthworm has a main dorsal vessel and a main ventral vessel, which are connected by smaller vessels, including a series of five \"hearts\" (aortic arches) near the anterior end and a network of capillaries that permeate the tissues. The dorsal vessel pumps blood forward, the aortic arches pump it to the ventral vessel, and the ventral vessel carries it toward the posterior end, distributing it to the body tissues via capillaries.\n\nStep 4: Predict the dye distribution in the earthworm.\nWhen the dye is injected into the earthworm's dorsal vessel, it becomes part of the blood. Since the blood is always contained within vessels, the dye will also remain confined to this vascular network. It will flow from the dorsal vessel, through the aortic arches, into the ventral vessel, and throughout the capillary network before returning to the dorsal vessel. This circulation is efficient, rapid, and occurs under higher pressure compared to an open system. The dye will not enter the general body cavity (the coelom).\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options based on the analysis.\nA. Incorrect. This describes a closed system for both. It is wrong for the grasshopper.\nB. Incorrect. This describes an open system for both. It is wrong for the earthworm.\nC. Incorrect. This description mischaracterizes both systems. The dye does not remain confined in the grasshopper's vessels, and it does not enter the coelomic cavity in the earthworm.\nD. Correct. This statement accurately describes the outcome for both animals. For the grasshopper (open system), the dye enters the main body cavity (hemocoel). For the earthworm (closed system), the dye remains within the vascular network.\nE. Incorrect. This statement reverses the characteristics of the two systems. The grasshopper lacks a dense capillary network for perfusion, and the earthworm's dye does not enter the body cavity.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that the dye will disperse into the body cavity of the grasshopper and remain within the vessels of the earthworm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1729208"}, {"introduction": "An organism's anatomy is profoundly shaped by the demands of its environment and lifestyle. This problem challenges you to act like an evolutionary biologist, using physiological data—such as size, activity level, and metabolic rate—to predict the type of circulatory system a newly discovered organism must possess [@problem_id:1729216]. This exercise moves beyond simple identification and encourages you to analyze why a closed system is an essential adaptation for large, active animals, linking circulatory structure directly to metabolic function.", "problem": "A team of marine biologists has discovered a new species of annelid-like organism, designated *Praedatorius abyssalis*, dwelling in deep-sea hydrothermal vent fields. This worm is notable for its large size, reaching up to 1.5 meters in length, and its highly active predatory behavior, which involves rapid, undulating movements to hunt smaller vent fauna. Physiological studies on captured specimens reveal a metabolic rate that is exceptionally high for an invertebrate of its phylum and is comparable to that of some small, active fish.\n\nBased on these biological characteristics—specifically its large size, active predatory lifestyle, and high metabolic rate—predict which type of circulatory system *Praedatorius abyssalis* most likely possesses and the primary functional reason for it.\n\nA. Open circulatory system: The low-pressure system is metabolically less costly to maintain, conserving energy in the resource-scarce deep-sea environment.\n\nB. Closed circulatory system: The high-pressure, rapid flow is necessary to efficiently deliver oxygen and nutrients to support its high metabolic demands.\n\nC. No circulatory system: Its worm-like body plan and aquatic environment allow it to rely solely on cutaneous respiration and direct diffusion across its body wall.\n\nD. Open circulatory system: Direct bathing of tissues in hemolymph allows for more effective bulk transfer of heat absorbed from the hydrothermal vents.\n\nE. Closed circulatory system: Confining the transport fluid within vessels prevents it from mixing with the toxic chemical-rich interstitial fluid of the vent environment.", "solution": "We begin by matching physiological demand to transport capacity. The organism is large (length up to 1.5 meters), highly active, and has a high metabolic rate. High aerobic metabolism imposes a high whole-body oxygen consumption rate, which can be expressed by the Fick principle:\n$$\n\\dot{V}_{O_{2}} = Q\\left(C_{aO_{2}} - C_{vO_{2}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{V}_{O_{2}}$ is oxygen consumption rate, $Q$ is convective flow (cardiac output or its analog), and $C_{aO_{2}}-C_{vO_{2}}$ is the arteriovenous oxygen content difference. To support a large $\\dot{V}_{O_{2}}$, the organism must achieve a large $Q$ and/or large arteriovenous difference. Achieving a large, precisely distributed $Q$ to active tissues is facilitated by a high-pressure, high-velocity vascular system with controlled perfusion.\n\nPure diffusion cannot meet the transport requirement over meter-scale distances. Diffusive flux follows Fick’s law:\n$$\nJ = -D \\nabla c,\n$$\nand the characteristic diffusion time over distance $L$ scales as\n$$\nt \\sim \\frac{L^{2}}{D}.\n$$\nFor large $L$, $t$ grows quadratically, making diffusion alone too slow to supply oxygen and nutrients to deep tissues in a large, active organism. Hence, bulk convective transport is required.\n\nBetween open and closed convective systems, the ability to generate and sustain high flow rates to specific tissues depends on achievable pressure gradients and controlled vascular resistances. For laminar flow in a vessel, Poiseuille’s law gives\n$$\nQ = \\frac{\\pi r^{4}}{8 \\eta L}\\,\\Delta P,\n$$\nwhere $r$ is vessel radius, $\\eta$ is dynamic viscosity, $L$ is vessel length, and $\\Delta P$ is the pressure difference. A closed circulatory system permits higher $\\Delta P$ and finely regulated vascular architecture, enabling higher $Q$ and targeted perfusion to active musculature, thereby meeting high $\\dot{V}_{O_{2}}$.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n- A. Open circulatory system for energy conservation conflicts with the stated high metabolic rate and activity, which demand rapid delivery; conserving pump work at the expense of delivery would be maladaptive in this context.\n- B. Closed circulatory system with high-pressure, rapid flow directly addresses the need for large $Q$ and targeted perfusion, satisfying the Fick principle requirement for high $\\dot{V}_{O_{2}}$.\n- C. No circulatory system relying on diffusion is incompatible with the diffusion time scaling $t \\sim L^{2}/D$ at meter-scale body size and high metabolic demand.\n- D. Open circulation to enhance heat transfer is not the primary selective pressure; deep-sea invertebrates are generally poor at endogenously retaining heat, and heat transfer from vents is more constrained by external exchange than by internal mixing of hemolymph. Moreover, open systems do not inherently confer superior targeted bulk transport for metabolism.\n- E. Preventing mixing with toxic external fluids is not a relevant distinction between open and closed systems; either system’s internal fluids are segregated from the environment by epithelia. The primary driver here is delivery capacity, not environmental chemical separation.\n\nTherefore, the organism most likely possesses a closed circulatory system to achieve the high-pressure, rapid convective transport necessary to support its large size, active predatory lifestyle, and high metabolic rate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1729216"}, {"introduction": "The differences between open and closed systems can be quantified using the principles of physics, revealing the dramatic contrast in their operational demands.

Assume that for both systems, the fluid-dynamic resistance is directly proportional to the fluid's viscosity.

Calculate the ratio of the absolute increase in cardiac power required by the CCS to the absolute increase in cardiac power required by the OCS to meet this physiological demand.", "solution": "For an idealized circulatory system, cardiac output satisfies $Q=\\frac{P}{R}$, where $P$ is the mean pressure and $R$ is the total resistance.
