At a specific research outpost, the ambient barometric pressure is measured to be $633$ mmHg. The dry air at this altitude consists of 21.0% oxygen ($O_2$). Within the lungs of the vizcacha, the inhaled air becomes warmed to its core body temperature and fully saturated with water vapor. This saturation contributes a water vapor partial pressure of $47.0$ mmHg. To understand the efficiency of gas exchange, the first step is to determine the oxygen pressure gradient.

We are given the total ambient barometric pressure, the percentage of oxygen in dry air, and the partial pressure of water vapor in the saturated alveolar air.\n\nThe guiding principle is Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures, which states that the total pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual component gases.\n\nIn the alveoli, the total pressure is equal to the ambient barometric pressure, $P_{atm}$. This total pressure is composed of the partial pressure of the inspired dry gases (oxygen, nitrogen, etc.) and the partial pressure of water vapor ($P_{H_2O}$), with which the air is saturated.\n$$P_{atm} = P_{dry\\_gases} + P_{H_2O}$$\n\nWe are given:\n- Total ambient barometric pressure, $P_{atm} = 633$ mmHg\n- Partial pressure of water vapor, $P_{H_2O} = 47.0$ mmHg\n\nFirst, we must determine the total pressure exerted by the dry gases in the alveoli. We can rearrange the equation above:\n$$P_{dry\\_gases} = P_{atm} - P_{H_2O}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P_{dry\\_gases} = 633 \\text{ mmHg} - 47.0 \\text{ mmHg} = 586 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n\nNow, we know the total pressure of the dry gas component of the alveolar air. The problem states that dry air is 21.0% oxygen. The partial pressure of oxygen ($P_{O_2}$) is this fraction of the total dry gas pressure.\n\nThe fraction of oxygen, $F_{O_2}$, is given as 21.0%, which is equivalent to 0.210 in decimal form.\n$$P_{O_2} = F_{O_2} \\times P_{dry\\_gases}$$\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n$$P_{O_2} = 0.210 \\times 586 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n$$P_{O_2} = 123.06 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

By relating diffusion distance to metabolic rate, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how insects dynamically regulate oxygen supply to meet cellular demands.", "problem": "In many insects, the terminal ends of the tracheal system, known as tracheoles, penetrate deep into tissues to deliver gaseous oxygen directly to respiring cells, such as flight muscles. The very tip of each tracheole is typically filled with a fluid. During periods of low metabolic activity (resting), this fluid-filled section can be relatively long. However, during periods of intense metabolic activity, such as flight, this fluid is drawn back towards the larger tracheae, effectively shortening the fluid-filled portion and bringing the air-fluid interface closer to the muscle cells.\n\nConsider a simplified model where a single, cylindrical tracheole of constant radius $r$ supplies oxygen to a muscle cell. Let the diffusion of oxygen occur only through the terminal, fluid-filled portion of the tracheole, which has a length $L$.
