The study focuses on two herbivorous species with distinct feeding strategies: the Bornean orangutan (*Pongo pygmaeus*), which is primarily a frugivore (fruit-eater), and the black-and-white colobus monkey (*Colobus guereza*), which is a folivore (leaf-eater).\n\nTo isolate the effect of diet, the zoologist considers two hypothetical individuals, one of each species, with an identical total body mass, $M_{total} = 70.0 \\text{ kg}$.\n\nBased on extensive physiological data, it is known that for a typical colobus monkey, the mass of the entire digestive tract (stomach, small intestine, and large intestine) constitutes approximately $P_C = 27\\%$ of its total body mass. For a typical orangutan, this value is significantly lower, with the digestive tract accounting for $P_O = 13\\%$ of its total body mass.\n\nCalculate the absolute difference in the mass of the digestive tracts between the hypothetical colobus monkey and the orangutan.
