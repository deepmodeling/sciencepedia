This exercise provides a fundamental scenario to test your understanding of how opening ion channels drives this change. By comparing the neuron's resting potential to the specific ion's equilibrium potential, you can predict whether the effect will be excitatory or inhibitory, a core principle in neurophysiology.

This neuron forms a synapse with another neuron that releases a specific neurotransmitter. When this neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, it exclusively opens ligand-gated ion channels that are permeable to a single species of ion. Through independent measurement, the equilibrium potential for this specific ion has been determined to be $E_{ion} = -90 \\text{ mV}$.\n\nWhat will be the immediate effect on the postsynaptic neuron's membrane potential at the site of the synapse when these channels open?\n\nA. The membrane will depolarize, becoming less negative.\n\nB. The membrane will hyperpolarize, becoming more negative.\n\nC. The membrane potential will not change.\n\nD.

The membrane will repolarize.", "solution": "Principle: When ligand-gated channels selective for a single ion open, the membrane potential $V_{m}$ is driven toward that ion’s equilibrium potential $E_{\\text{ion}}$ by the ionic current. For a channel with conductance $g_{\\text{ion}}$, the ionic current is\n$$\nI_{\\text{ion}} = g_{\\text{ion}}\\left(V_{m} - E_{\\text{ion}}\\right),\n$$\nand the membrane equation gives\n$$\nC_{m}\\frac{dV_{m}}{dt} = - I_{\\text{ion}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{dV_{m}}{dt} = - \\frac{g_{\\text{ion}}}{C_{m}}\\left(V_{m} - E_{\\text{ion}}\\right).\n$$\nUpon channel opening, $g_{\\text{ion}} > 0$. Given that $E_{\\text{ion}}$ is more negative than the resting $V_{m}$ (specifically, $E_{\\text{ion}} = -90 \\text{ mV}$ and $V_{m} = -70 \\text{ mV}$, so $E_{\\text{ion}} < V_{m}$), it follows that\n$$\nV_{m} - E_{\\text{ion}} > 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{dV_{m}}{dt} < 0.\n$$\nTherefore, immediately after the channels open, $V_{m}$ becomes more negative at the synapse and is driven toward $E_{\\text{ion}}$.
