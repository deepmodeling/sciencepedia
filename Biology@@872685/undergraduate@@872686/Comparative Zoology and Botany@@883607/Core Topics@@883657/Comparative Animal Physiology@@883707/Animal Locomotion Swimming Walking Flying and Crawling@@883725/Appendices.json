This can be achieved by different biomechanical strategies. Consider simplified models for a diving beetle (which swims fully submerged) and a water strider (which moves on the water surface).\n\nWe define a \"stroke efficiency ratio,\" $\\mathcal{R}$, as the ratio of the propulsive force during the power stroke to the resistive drag force during the recovery stroke: $\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{F_{\\text{power}}}{F_{\\text{recovery}}}$.

For this simplified analysis, assume the speed of the leg, $v$, is the same for both the power and recovery strokes.\n\n1.  **Diving Beetle Model:** The beetle swims underwater. It propels itself by changing the effective area of its oar-like legs. During the power stroke, the leg is broad, presenting a large area, $A_p$. During the recovery stroke, the leg is 'feathered' to present a smaller area, $A_r$. We are given that the ratio of these areas is $\\frac{A_p}{A_r} = 12.0$. The drag coefficient, $C_{D, \\text{beetle}}$, is assumed to be constant for both strokes.\n\n2.  **Water Strider Model:** The strider moves on the water surface. Its legs maintain a constant area of interaction with the water, $A_{\\text{strider}}$. Propulsion is achieved by changing the way the leg interacts with the surface. During the power stroke, the leg pushes down and back, creating a dimple and generating significant propulsion, modeled by a high effective drag coefficient, $C_{D,p}$. During the recovery stroke, it glides forward with minimal disturbance, modeled by a low effective drag coefficient, $C_{D,r}$. We are given that the ratio of these coefficients is $\\frac{C_{D,p}}{C_{D,r}} = 9.0$.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the diving beetle's stroke efficiency to the water strider's stroke efficiency, $\\frac{\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{beetle}}}{\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{strider}}}$.

It propagates a wave of contraction along its body. For this problem, we model the burrowing process as the annelid pushing its narrowed anterior segment through the substrate.
