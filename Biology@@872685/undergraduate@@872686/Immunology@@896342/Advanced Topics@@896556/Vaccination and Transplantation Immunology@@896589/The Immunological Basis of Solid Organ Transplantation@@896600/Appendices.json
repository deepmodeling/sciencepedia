This first practice problem places you in a classic clinical scenario, challenging you to interpret the timing of organ dysfunction and key microscopic findings from a biopsy.

The pre-transplant crossmatch test for pre-formed antibodies against the donor was negative. The initial post-operative period is unremarkable, and the new kidney functions well. However, seven days post-transplantation, the patient presents with a fever, graft tenderness, and a significant rise in serum creatinine levels, indicating acute kidney dysfunction. A renal biopsy is performed, and the histopathological examination reveals a dense infiltration of lymphocytes, predominantly T-cells, within the kidney interstitium and tubules, along with evidence of tubulitis.\n\nBased on the timing of the onset and the specific histopathological findings, which of the following is the most likely immunological diagnosis?\n\nA. Hyperacute rejection\n\nB. Acute cellular rejection\n\nC. Chronic rejection\n\nD. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)\n\nE. Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR)", "solution": "We first analyze the timing of the dysfunction. The onset at seven days post-transplantation is consistent with an acute rejection process rather than hyperacute (which occurs within minutes to hours) or chronic (which typically develops over months to years). Therefore, the timing supports an acute rejection category.\n\nNext, we interpret the histopathology. The biopsy shows a dense infiltration of lymphocytes, predominantly T-cells, within the interstitium and tubules, with tubulitis. This pattern is characteristic of acute cellular (T-cell mediated) rejection, a type IV hypersensitivity reaction driven by recipient T-cells recognizing donor alloantigens, leading to interstitial inflammation and tubulitis; endothelitis may also be seen.\n\nWe then exclude the alternatives:\n- Hyperacute rejection is mediated by preformed anti-donor antibodies (type II hypersensitivity), producing immediate graft failure with widespread thrombosis, neutrophilic infiltrates, and fibrinoid necrosis. A negative pre-transplant crossmatch and the delayed timing argue strongly against this.\n- Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in the acute setting would show microvascular injury with peritubular capillaritis, glomerulitis, $C4d$ deposition, and prominent neutrophils/plasma cells, not a predominantly T-cell interstitial infiltrate with tubulitis.\n- Chronic rejection presents later with progressive interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and vascular intimal thickening, not acute T-cell–rich interstitial infiltrates and tubulitis.\n- Graft-versus-host disease is a complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in which donor T-cells attack recipient tissues; it is not the typical process in solid organ transplantation such as kidney.\n\nCombining the timing and the specific T-cell–predominant interstitial infiltrate with tubulitis, the most likely diagnosis is acute cellular rejection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2276641"}, {"introduction": "Preventing rejection is as critical as diagnosing it. Modern immunosuppressive strategies often rely on targeting specific molecular pathways that are crucial for the activation of alloreactive lymphocytes. This exercise [@problem_id:2276597] delves into the mechanism of basiliximab, a widely used induction agent, asking you to connect the fundamental role of Interleukin-2 ($IL-2$) in T-cell proliferation to the drug's therapeutic effect.", "problem": "A patient undergoing a solid organ transplantation, such as a kidney transplant from an unrelated donor, is at high risk for graft rejection. This rejection is primarily mediated by the recipient's T-lymphocytes that recognize the donor's cells as foreign, a phenomenon known as alloreactivity. To prevent this, the patient is treated with an immunosuppressive drug called basiliximab. Basiliximab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the alpha chain (also known as CD25) of the Interleukin-2 ($IL-2$) receptor. The high-affinity $IL-2$ receptor, which is crucial for T-cell function, is composed of three chains: alpha (CD25), beta (CD122), and gamma (CD132). The alpha chain (CD25) is not highly expressed on resting T-cells but is rapidly upregulated upon their activation.\n\nGiven the mechanism of action of basiliximab, what is the primary consequence for the alloreactive T-cells that have been activated by the foreign graft tissue?\n\nA. Inhibition of clonal proliferation.\n\nB. Direct and immediate induction of apoptosis in resting T-cells.\n\nC. Blockade of the initial interaction between the T-cell receptor and the foreign Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules.\n\nD. Prevention of T-cell differentiation into memory cells.\n\nE. Upregulation of inhibitory co-stimulatory molecules on the T-cell surface.", "solution": "1. Fundamental immunology of allorejection: Alloreactive T-lymphocytes recognizing donor antigen presented on foreign MHC become activated through TCR engagement plus costimulation. Upon activation, these T-cells rapidly upregulate the alpha chain (CD25) of the high-affinity $IL-2$ receptor, whose full high-affinity form comprises the alpha (CD25), beta (CD122), and common gamma (CD132) chains. Activated T-cells also produce $IL-2$, which binds in an autocrine and paracrine fashion to the high-affinity $IL-2$ receptor, triggering JAK/STAT signaling that drives entry into the cell cycle, clonal expansion, and differentiation. Thus, $IL-2$ signaling is the critical driver of clonal proliferation of activated T-cells.\n\n2. Mechanism of basiliximab: Basiliximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against CD25 (the IL-2R alpha chain). By binding CD25, basiliximab blocks the assembly and/or function of the high-affinity $IL-2$ receptor on activated T-cells, preventing $IL-2$ from productively engaging its receptor and transducing proliferative signals. Resting T-cells express little to no CD25, so they are largely spared.\n\n3. Primary consequence for activated alloreactive T-cells: Because $IL-2$ signaling is required for clonal expansion after activation, blockade of CD25 primarily prevents $IL-2$–dependent proliferation of these activated T-cells. It does not directly induce apoptosis of resting T-cells, does not interfere with the initial TCR–MHC interaction (signal 1), and does not specifically upregulate inhibitory co-stimulatory molecules. While reduced proliferation can secondarily diminish the pool from which memory cells arise, the principal and most immediate effect is inhibition of clonal proliferation.\n\n4. Option assessment:\n- A. Inhibition of clonal proliferation: Correct, as explained above via $IL-2$ receptor blockade on activated T-cells.\n- B. Direct and immediate induction of apoptosis in resting T-cells: Incorrect; resting T-cells lack high CD25 expression and basiliximab is not an apoptotic agent for resting T-cells.\n- C. Blockade of the initial interaction between the T-cell receptor and foreign MHC: Incorrect; this interaction involves the TCR and MHC, not IL-2R.\n- D. Prevention of T-cell differentiation into memory cells: Not the primary mechanism; any effect is indirect and secondary to reduced proliferation.\n- E. Upregulation of inhibitory co-stimulatory molecules: Not the mechanism of basiliximab.\n\nTherefore, the primary consequence is inhibition of clonal proliferation of activated alloreactive T-cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2276597"}, {"introduction": "While T-cell and anti-Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) antibody responses are primary drivers of rejection, the field increasingly recognizes other pathogenic pathways. This advanced scenario [@problem_id:2276585] presents a diagnostic puzzle: signs of antibody-mediated rejection without the typical anti-HLA antibodies. You will explore the role of non-HLA antibodies and trace their pathological effects through the complement cascade, revealing a more nuanced and complex picture of graft injury.", "problem": "A 45-year-old patient receives a kidney transplant from a deceased donor. The pre-transplant crossmatch, which tests for pre-formed donor-specific anti-Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) antibodies in the recipient's serum, was negative. Three months post-transplantation, the patient presents with rising serum creatinine and proteinuria, indicative of graft dysfunction. A kidney biopsy reveals features consistent with antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), including inflammation of peritubular capillaries (capillaritis) and deposition of the complement component $C4d$ on the endothelial lining of these capillaries.\n\nHowever, repeated sensitive post-transplant testing for donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies remains negative. Further investigation reveals the presence of high-titer agonistic autoantibodies against the Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor (AT1R) in the patient's serum. AT1R is a G-protein coupled receptor expressed on vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, which normally binds angiotensin II to mediate vasoconstriction and inflammation. Assume these anti-AT1R antibodies are of the IgG isotype and can activate the classical complement pathway.\n\nGiven this scenario, which of the following sets of downstream cellular and molecular events is the most direct and likely consequence of anti-AT1R antibody binding to the endothelial cells of the transplanted kidney, leading to the observed AMR pathology?\n\nA. Activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, leading to direct lysis of endothelial cells via perforin and granzyme release.\n\nB. Chronic activation of AT1R signaling, leading to decreased production of reactive oxygen species and inhibition of the $NF-\\kappa B$ pathway, causing endothelial cell apoptosis.\n\nC. Formation of membrane attack complexes (MAC) leading to endothelial cell injury, and recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes via complement split products like C5a.\n\nD. Internalization of the antibody-receptor complex, leading to T-cell anergy and long-term graft tolerance.\n\nE. Binding of antibodies to AT1R expressed on renal tubular epithelial cells, causing direct inhibition of sodium reabsorption and leading to proteinuria.", "solution": "We identify the pathological context and map the most direct mechanistic consequences of the detected antibodies to the observed biopsy findings.\n\n1. Clinical and pathological clues:\n- The biopsy shows capillaritis and $C4d$ deposition in peritubular capillaries, which are classic features of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR).\n- Post-transplant tests for donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies are negative, but there are high-titer agonistic IgG autoantibodies against AT1R, a receptor on vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells.\n- The problem stipulates that these IgG antibodies can activate the classical complement pathway.\n\n2. Direct mechanism initiated by anti-AT1R IgG:\n- IgG bound to AT1R on endothelial cells presents Fc regions that can bind $C1q$, initiating the classical complement pathway.\n- Classical complement activation sequence:\n  - $C1q$ binding to Fc regions activates $C1r$ and $C1s$.\n  - $C1s$ cleaves $C4$ into $C4a$ and $C4b$; $C4b$ covalently binds to the endothelial surface.\n  - $C2$ binds $C4b$ and is cleaved to form $C2a$, generating the $C3$ convertase $C4b2a$.\n  - $C4b2a$ cleaves $C3$ into $C3a$ and $C3b$; $C3b$ associates to form the $C5$ convertase $C4b2a3b$.\n  - $C4b2a3b$ cleaves $C5$ into $C5a$ and $C5b$; $C5b$ seeds assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC) $C5b-9$.\n- Consequences of complement activation:\n  - $C4d$ deposition: $C4b$ on the endothelial surface is degraded to $C4d$, which remains covalently attached, explaining the biopsy finding of $C4d$ positivity.\n  - MAC formation ($C5b-9$) causes direct endothelial cell injury.\n  - Anaphylatoxins $C3a$ and especially $C5a$ promote recruitment and activation of neutrophils and monocytes, increasing vascular permeability and driving capillaritis.\n\n3. Relationship to observed pathology:\n- Endothelial injury by MAC and leukocyte recruitment via $C5a$ directly explain peritubular capillaritis, $C4d$ deposition, rising creatinine, and proteinuria due to glomerular microvascular injury and increased permeability.\n- This is the canonical pathway of AMR when complement-fixing IgG binds targets on the endothelium, even if the antigen is non-HLA (here, AT1R).\n\n4. Exclusion of other options:\n- A: Activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes with perforin/granzyme is characteristic of cell-mediated rejection, not the complement-dependent AMR with $C4d$ deposition driven by antibodies.\n- B: AT1R signaling typically promotes vasoconstriction, inflammation, increased reactive oxygen species, and activation of $NF-\\kappa B$, not decreased reactive oxygen species or inhibition of $NF-\\kappa B$; moreover, this does not account for complement-mediated $C4d$ deposition.\n- D: Internalization leading to T-cell anergy and tolerance contradicts the ongoing AMR pathology and does not explain $C4d$ deposition or capillaritis.\n- E: While AT1R is most relevant on vascular cells in this context, antibody binding to tubular epithelial cells to inhibit sodium reabsorption does not explain complement activation, $C4d$ deposition, or capillaritis; proteinuria arises from glomerular microvascular injury rather than direct tubular sodium handling inhibition.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and likely consequence is complement activation with MAC-mediated endothelial injury and leukocyte recruitment via complement split products such as $C5a$, matching option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2276585"}]}
