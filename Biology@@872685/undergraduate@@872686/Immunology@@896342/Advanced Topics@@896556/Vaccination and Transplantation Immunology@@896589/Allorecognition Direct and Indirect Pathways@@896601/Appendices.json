By analyzing the components of a one-way MLR, this exercise challenges you to identify which specific allorecognition pathway is being modeled, providing a concrete understanding of the cellular events that kickstart the rejection process [@problem_id:2215635].", "problem": "An immunology researcher is investigating the mechanisms of acute graft rejection using an in vitro model. The experimental setup is a standard one-way Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction (MLR). For this assay, the researcher isolates two cell populations:\n\n1.  A highly purified population of T-lymphocytes, which will act as the responder cells, from a potential transplant recipient mouse (Strain A).\n2.  A population of splenocytes, which will act as the stimulator cells, from a potential organ donor mouse (Strain B). Splenocytes contain various cell types, including professional Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells. The splenocytes from Strain B are treated with gamma irradiation, which renders them incapable of cell division but keeps them metabolically active and structurally intact for the duration of the assay.\n\nThe two cell populations are co-cultured. T-cell activation and proliferation from Strain A are then measured. The results show a robust proliferative response from the recipient's T-lymphocytes. This in vitro reaction is designed to predominantly model one of the key immunological pathways that can lead to graft rejection in vivo. The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules are the primary targets of this recognition.\n\nWhich of the following pathways of allorecognition is this experimental setup predominantly designed to simulate?\n\nA.

Natural Killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity", "solution": "The experimental design is a standard one-way Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction in which responder T-lymphocytes from Strain A are co-cultured with gamma-irradiated splenocytes from Strain B. Gamma irradiation prevents the stimulator cells from proliferating but preserves their metabolic activity, surface molecules, and antigen-presenting function. Thus, the donor splenocytes, including their professional Antigen-Presenting Cells, retain intact donor Major Histocompatibility Complex molecules with bound peptides on their surface.\n\nIn a one-way MLR, the proliferative response measured arises from the activation of responder T cells that recognize alloantigens presented by the stimulator population. Because the stimulator cells are donor-derived and maintain intact donor Major Histocompatibility Complex molecules, the responder T cells from the recipient directly engage these intact allogeneic Major Histocompatibility Complex–peptide complexes via their T-cell receptors. This mechanism corresponds to the direct pathway of allorecognition, in which recipient T cells recognize intact donor Major Histocompatibility Complex on donor Antigen-Presenting Cells.\n\nBy contrast, the indirect pathway would require donor antigens to be processed by recipient Antigen-Presenting Cells and presented on self Major Histocompatibility Complex, which is not the primary interaction promoted in this assay since donor Antigen-Presenting Cells are present and active. The semi-direct pathway involves transfer of intact donor Major Histocompatibility Complex to recipient Antigen-Presenting Cells (cross-dressing), which is not the intended principal mechanism modeled here. Humoral rejection mediated by B cells and Natural Killer cell–mediated cytotoxicity are not the primary readouts of a T-cell proliferation–based MLR and are not specifically modeled by this setup.\n\nTherefore, the robust T-cell proliferation observed in this one-way MLR with irradiated donor splenocytes predominantly models the direct pathway of allorecognition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2215635"}, {"introduction": "A key feature of allorecognition is the striking difference in the number of T cells that can be activated by the direct versus the indirect pathway. The direct pathway engages a surprisingly large fraction of the T cell repertoire, explaining the potent nature of acute rejection. This exercise uses a hypothetical but conceptually elegant mouse model to quantify this disparity, demonstrating through calculation why eliminating the T cell clones responsible for direct recognition has such a profound impact on the initial anti-graft response [@problem_id:2215634].", "problem": "In the field of transplant immunology, allorecognition describes the process by which the recipient's immune system recognizes and responds to the tissues of a genetically different donor. This response is primarily mediated by T cells and can occur through two main pathways: the direct and indirect pathways.\n\nConsider an experimental model involving a skin graft from a C3H donor mouse (expressing the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) haplotype H-2k) to a C57BL/6 recipient mouse (haplotype H-2b). An immunologist prepares two groups of recipient C57BL/6 mice.\n\n**Group 1 (Control):** These are normal, unmodified C57BL/6 mice. Their T cells can recognize the donor H-2k tissue through both direct and indirect pathways.\n**Group 2 (Tolerized):** These are genetically engineered C57BL/6 mice that, during their embryonic development, expressed the donor H-2k MHC molecule exclusively within their thymus. This process induces central tolerance, leading to the deletion of all T cell clones whose T Cell Receptors (TCRs) can strongly bind to the intact allogeneic H-2k MHC molecule. Consequently, in these mice, the direct pathway of allorecognition is non-functional.\n\nUpon transplantation of the C3H skin graft, T cell activation begins in the draining lymph node. Assume the following parameters for the initial activation events:\n- The total number of naive CD4$^+$ T cells in the draining lymph node of a recipient mouse is $N_T = 5.0 \\times 10^6$.\n- The precursor frequency of naive CD4$^+$ T cells that can be activated via the **direct pathway** (i.e., cells whose TCRs directly recognize the intact allogeneic H-2k MHC molecules on donor Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs)) is $f_{direct} = 0.01$.\n- The cumulative precursor frequency of naive CD4$^+$ T cells that can be activated via the **indirect pathway** (i.e., cells whose TCRs recognize peptides derived from donor H-2k proteins presented by the recipient's own H-2b MHC molecules on recipient APCs) is $f_{indirect} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the total number of initially responding naive CD4$^+$ T cells in a control mouse to the total number of initially responding naive CD4$^+$ T cells in a tolerized mouse. Your final answer should be an exact integer.", "solution": "We are asked for the ratio of the total number of initially responding naive CD4^{+} T cells in a control mouse to that in a tolerized mouse. Let $N_{T}$ be the total naive CD4^{+} T cells in the draining lymph node, $f_{direct}$ the precursor frequency for the direct pathway, and $f_{indirect}$ the cumulative precursor frequency for the indirect pathway.\n\nBy definition of precursor frequency, the expected number of initially responding cells equals the total naive pool multiplied by the relevant precursor frequency for the pathway(s) available.\n\nIn the control mouse, both pathways are available, so the total initially responding cells are\n$$\nN_{\\text{control}}=N_{T}\\left(f_{direct}+f_{indirect}\\right).\n$$\n\nIn the tolerized mouse, central tolerance has deleted all clones capable of direct allorecognition of intact H\\text{-}2k, so only the indirect pathway contributes.

While the direct pathway, fueled by donor antigen-presenting cells (APCs), dominates acute rejection, it wanes as these \"passenger\" cells disappear. This final practice delves into a complex clinical scenario twenty years post-transplant, where a genetic change within the graft poses a new threat. Your task is to deduce the only viable pathway for rejection in this late stage, highlighting the critical role of recipient APCs and the indirect pathway in chronic graft injury [@problem_id:2215654].", "problem": "A 25-year-old patient with end-stage liver disease receives a liver allograft. The patient's relevant Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) haplotype is HLA-A*02:01 / HLA-B*07:02, and the donor's is HLA-A*02:01 / HLA-A*11:01 / HLA-B*08:01. The transplant is successful, with a single mismatch at the HLA-A locus (patient lacks HLA-A*11:01) and one at the HLA-B locus. The patient is maintained on long-term immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nTwenty years post-transplantation, routine surveillance biopsy of the graft reveals a small, distinct population of hepatocytes that has undergone a somatic mutational event. Genetic analysis of this clone of cells shows a targeted Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) at the donor's HLA-A locus. Specifically, the cells have lost the chromosome segment containing the shared HLA-A*02:01 allele, resulting in a cell population that is now homozygous for the mismatched allele, expressing only HLA-A*11:01. The professional \"passenger\" donor Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells, that originally populated the graft at the time of transplant are now completely absent, having been replaced by recipient-derived APCs.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the principal T-cell-mediated immunological pathway that could initiate rejection against this newly emerged hepatocyte population?\n\nA. Rejection is initiated via the direct pathway, where recipient CD8$^+$ T-cells recognize the increased density of HLA-A*11:01 molecules on the surface of the mutated hepatocytes, which then migrate to draining lymph nodes to activate a T-cell response.\n\nB. Rejection is initiated via the indirect pathway, where recipient APCs phagocytose apoptotic mutated hepatocytes, process the foreign HLA-A*11:01 protein, and present its peptides on their own recipient Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class II molecules to activate recipient CD4$^+$ T-cells.\n\nC. No T-cell mediated rejection will occur, as the recipient's immune system has been peripherally tolerant to the donor's HLA-A*11:01 antigen for two decades, and the change in gene dosage at this locus is insufficient to break this established tolerance.\n\nD. Rejection is initiated via the direct pathway, where recipient CD8$^+$ T-cells that were anergized by the original graft now become activated by the homozygous HLA-A*11:01 hepatocytes, leading to a potent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response within the liver sinusoids.\n\nE. Rejection is initiated by a semi-direct pathway, where recipient T-cells recognize intact donor HLA-A*11:01 molecules that have been acquired and displayed on the surface of recipient APCs through a process of membrane exchange (trogocytosis).", "solution": "Identify the relevant pathways of allorecognition and their requirements. In the direct pathway, intact donor MHC on professional donor APCs is recognized by recipient T-cell receptors. This requires the continued presence of donor APCs that migrate to secondary lymphoid organs to prime naive T cells with adequate costimulation. In the indirect pathway, recipient APCs phagocytose donor-derived material (including donor MHC proteins), process it, and present donor-derived peptides in the context of recipient MHC, typically MHC class II to activate recipient $CD4^{+}$ T cells; cross-presentation on recipient MHC class I can also prime $CD8^{+}$ T cells. In the semi-direct pathway, recipient APCs acquire intact donor MHC molecules (for example by trogocytosis) and present these intact donor MHCs to recipient T cells.\n\nApply the scenario constraints. Twenty years post-transplant, donor professional APCs are absent, having been replaced by recipient-derived APCs. Therefore, the direct pathway that depends on donor APCs is not available as the principal route for initiating a new T-cell response. Hepatocytes are parenchymal cells; they are not professional APCs, typically lack sufficient costimulatory molecule expression to prime naive T cells, and do not migrate to draining lymph nodes to initiate primary T-cell activation. The newly emerged hepatocyte clone expresses only the mismatched donor HLA-A*11:01 due to loss of the shared HLA-A*02:01 allele (loss of heterozygosity). This increases the proportion of donor-alloantigen on these cells, but it does not create donor professional APCs nor confer lymph node migratory or costimulatory capacity to hepatocytes.\n\nDetermine the pathway most likely to initiate rejection under these conditions. Recipient APCs in the graft and draining lymphoid tissues continuously sample cell debris; they can phagocytose apoptotic mutated hepatocytes, process the donor HLA-A*11:01 protein, and present peptides derived from HLA-A*11:01 on recipient MHC class II to activate recipient $CD4^{+}$ T cells. This is the canonical indirect pathway operative in late post-transplant settings where donor APCs are absent. Activated $CD4^{+}$ T cells can then provide help for $CD8^{+}$ T-cell responses via cross-priming by recipient APCs and support effector mechanisms that mediate graft injury.\n\nExclude the incorrect options. Option A incorrectly assigns a direct pathway initiated by parenchymal hepatocytes that would migrate to lymph nodes; hepatocytes neither function as professional APCs nor mediate direct priming, and donor APCs are absent. Option D similarly misattributes activation to a direct pathway by hepatocytes and suggests reversal of anergy by increased HLA density without appropriate costimulation or donor APCs; this is not how direct allorecognition is initiated. Option C assumes durable peripheral tolerance to HLA-A*11:01 that cannot be broken by altered gene dosage; however, in the absence of donor APCs, new priming via the indirect pathway remains possible when recipient APCs process and present HLA-A*11:01-derived peptides, and peripheral tolerance is neither assured nor immutable under ongoing antigen sampling and potential inflammatory cues. Option E describes the semi-direct pathway, which can occur when recipient APCs acquire intact donor MHC; while possible, it is not the principal late pathway emphasized in scenarios where donor APCs are absent. The dominant initiating mechanism in this late post-transplant context is the indirect pathway.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the principal T-cell-mediated pathway initiating rejection against the new hepatocyte population is the indirect pathway described in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2215654"}]}
