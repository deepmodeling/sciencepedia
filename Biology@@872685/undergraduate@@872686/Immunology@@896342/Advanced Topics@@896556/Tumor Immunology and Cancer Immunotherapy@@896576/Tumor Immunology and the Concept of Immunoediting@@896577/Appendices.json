{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A central theme in tumor immunology is the constant battle between the immune system's ability to detect cancer and the cancer's ability to hide. This exercise explores a classic immunoediting scenario, focusing on the dual role of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I molecules. By examining a hypothetical tumor cell that loses MHC-I expression [@problem_id:2282575], you can directly explore the \"missing-self\" hypothesis and understand the delicate trade-off between evading Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) and becoming a target for Natural Killer (NK) cells.", "problem": "In the field of tumor immunology, a central concept is how cancer cells evolve to evade the immune system. Two primary cytotoxic effector cells involved in anti-tumor immunity are Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) and Natural Killer (NK) cells.\n\n- **Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs)** are a component of the adaptive immune system. They recognize and kill target cells by using their T-cell receptor to bind to specific foreign or mutated peptides presented on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I molecules on the surface of the target cell.\n- **Natural Killer (NK) cells** are part of the innate immune system. Their activity is governed by a balance of signals from activating and inhibitory receptors. A crucial inhibitory signal for NK cells is the recognition of self-MHC Class I molecules on a cell's surface. The absence of these molecules, a phenomenon described by the \"missing-self\" hypothesis, removes this inhibition and can lead to NK cell-mediated killing of the target cell.\n\nA research team is studying a human melanoma cell line. They engineer a mutant version of this cell line by deleting the gene for beta-2-microglobulin ($\\beta_2$m). The $\\beta_2$m protein is a necessary component for the stable assembly and expression of MHC Class I molecules on the cell surface. Consequently, the mutant cell line fails to display MHC Class I molecules.\n\nCompared to the original, unmodified (wild-type) melanoma cells which express normal levels of MHC Class I, how would the susceptibility of this new mutant cell line to killing by CTLs and NK cells be altered?\n\nA. It would become more susceptible to both CTLs and NK cells.\n\nB. It would become less susceptible to both CTLs and NK cells.\n\nC. It would become more susceptible to CTLs but less susceptible to NK cells.\n\nD. It would become less susceptible to CTLs but more susceptible to NK cells.\n\nE. There would be no change in its susceptibility to either cell type.", "solution": "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes require recognition of specific peptides bound to Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I on target cells through their T-cell receptors to initiate killing. Deletion of beta-2-microglobulin prevents the proper assembly and surface expression of MHC Class I, thereby eliminating peptide–MHC Class I complexes on the melanoma cell surface. Without MHC Class I, CTLs cannot engage their T-cell receptor with antigen-presenting complexes on these tumor cells, so the mutant cells become less susceptible to CTL-mediated killing.\n\nNatural Killer cells integrate activating and inhibitory signals, with a key inhibitory input being recognition of self–MHC Class I on potential target cells. According to the missing-self hypothesis, loss of MHC Class I removes this inhibitory signal, tipping the balance toward activation and cytotoxicity by NK cells. Therefore, absence of MHC Class I due to beta-2-microglobulin deletion makes the mutant melanoma cells more susceptible to NK cell-mediated killing.\n\nCombining these two effects, the mutant cell line is less susceptible to CTLs but more susceptible to NK cells, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2282575"}, {"introduction": "Immune evasion by tumors can be more subtle than simply becoming invisible. Even when a T cell successfully recognizes a tumor antigen presented on an MHC molecule (Signal 1), the tumor may fail to provide the necessary secondary \"go\" signal (Signal 2) required for full activation. This practice problem [@problem_id:2282564] investigates how the absence of costimulatory molecules on a tumor cell can switch off an anti-tumor T cell response, inducing a state of functional paralysis known as anergy.", "problem": "A research group is investigating a novel mechanism of tumor immune evasion in a murine model of carcinoma. The engineered tumor cells are designed to express a strong, non-self peptide antigen, designated `TAA-1`, which is effectively processed and presented on their surface by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules. However, genetic modification ensures these tumor cells completely lack the cell-surface expression of B7 family costimulatory molecules (specifically, B7-1/CD80 and B7-2/CD86). When naive CD8+ T cells whose T-cell receptors (TCRs) are specific for the `TAA-1`/MHC-I complex are co-cultured with these tumor cells, the T cells not only fail to become activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes but are subsequently unable to respond to the same antigen when presented by fully competent professional antigen-presenting cells. This induced state of unresponsiveness is known as anergy.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and direct explanation for the induction of anergy in these CD8+ T cells?\n\nA. The affinity of the T-cell receptor for the `TAA-1`/MHC-I complex is too low to initiate an intracellular signaling cascade, preventing Signal 1 of T cell activation.\n\nB. The tumor cells actively secrete inhibitory cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-$\\beta$), which override the activation signals and induce a quiescent state in the T cells.\n\nC. The interaction between the TCR and the `TAA-1`/MHC-I complex delivers the first activation signal, but the absence of B7-mediated co-stimulation through CD28 on the T cell results in an anergic state instead of full activation.\n\nD. The T cells recognize the `TAA-1` peptide but fail to activate because they do not express the necessary co-receptor, CD8, required to stabilize the MHC-I interaction.\n\nE. The tumor cells express PD-L1, which binds to the PD-1 receptor on the T cells, delivering a potent inhibitory signal that actively shuts down the T cell's activation program.", "solution": "Fundamental principle: Naive T cell activation requires two signals. Signal 1 is delivered when the TCR recognizes a specific peptide-MHC complex. Signal 2 is delivered when CD28 on the T cell binds B7-1 (CD80) or B7-2 (CD86) on the antigen-presenting cell. In the absence of Signal 2, TCR engagement alone induces anergy rather than activation, characterized by failure to produce interleukin-2 and long-lasting unresponsiveness to subsequent antigen exposure. Symbolically,\n$$\n\\text{Activation} \\iff S_{1} \\land S_{2}, \\qquad \\text{Anergy} \\iff S_{1} \\land \\neg S_{2}.\n$$\n\nApplication to the scenario: The engineered tumor cells process and present the non-self antigen `TAA-1` on MHC class I, ensuring that naive CD8^{+} T cells receive Signal 1 via their TCRs recognizing the `TAA-1`/MHC-I complex. However, these tumor cells lack B7-1 and B7-2, so they cannot provide co-stimulation through CD28; therefore Signal 2 is absent. Thus, in this system $S_{1}=\\text{true}$ and $S_{2}=\\text{false}$, which by the rule above leads to anergy.\n\nWhy the alternatives are less accurate:\n- Option A is incorrect because Signal 1 is present by design: the antigen is effectively processed and presented, and the T cells are specific for `TAA-1`/MHC-I.\n- Option B introduces inhibitory cytokines such as TGF-$\\beta$, which can suppress T cells, but the most direct and sufficient cause given is the absence of B7-mediated co-stimulation; cytokine secretion is not specified and is not required to explain anergy here.\n- Option D is incorrect because the cells are CD8^{+} T cells, so they do express CD8; lack of CD8 is not the issue.\n- Option E involves PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory signaling, which is not described here and is not necessary to explain the observed anergy; the defining experimental manipulation is the absence of B7 ligands.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and direct explanation is that TCR engagement (Signal 1) without B7-CD28 co-stimulation (Signal 2) induces anergy, as stated in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2282564"}, {"introduction": "Modern immunotherapies, such as Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, are designed to overcome the immune evasion tactics used by cancer. However, their power comes with significant risks rooted in the fundamental challenge of distinguishing tumor cells from healthy tissue. This clinical scenario [@problem_id:2282558] asks you to predict the consequences of targeting an antigen that, while overexpressed on cancer cells, is also found on healthy cells, illustrating the critical concept of \"on-target, off-tumor\" toxicity.", "problem": "A team of immunologists is developing a novel Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for a subset of aggressive breast cancers. This therapy involves genetically engineering a patient's own T cells to express a CAR that specifically recognizes and binds to the Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2), a protein found on the cell surface. In the targeted cancer cells, HER2 is significantly overexpressed, promoting uncontrolled cell growth. However, detailed proteomic analysis of healthy human tissues reveals that HER2 is also expressed, although at very low concentrations, on the surface of cardiomyocytes, the muscle cells of the heart.\n\nA patient with HER2-positive breast cancer is treated with this new CAR T-cell therapy. Following the infusion of the engineered cells, the patient's tumors begin to shrink, but the patient also develops a serious complication. Based on the mechanism of CAR T-cell action and the specified distribution of the target antigen, which of the following is the most direct and predictable major adverse effect of this specific therapy?\n\nA. Severe bone marrow suppression, leading to anemia and neutropenia.\n\nB. Onset of acute kidney injury due to tumor lysis syndrome.\n\nC. Cardiotoxicity, manifesting as inflammation and damage to the heart muscle.\n\nD. Anaphylactic shock resulting from a type I hypersensitivity reaction to the infused T cells.\n\nE. Widespread neurotoxicity, including confusion and seizures, caused by systemic cytokine release.", "solution": "CAR T-cell therapy works by engineering patient T cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor that binds a specific surface antigen independent of major histocompatibility complex, leading to T-cell activation and targeted cytotoxicity against any cell expressing that antigen. A key, predictable risk is on-target, off-tumor toxicity: if the target antigen is also present on healthy tissues, CAR T cells will attack those healthy cells proportionally to antigen expression.\n\nIn this scenario, the CAR targets HER2, which is overexpressed on the tumor but also present at low levels on cardiomyocytes. Because CAR T recognition depends on antigen presence rather than tissue type, these engineered T cells can bind HER2 on cardiomyocytes and mediate immune injury, causing myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, or heart failure. Thus, cardiotoxicity is the most direct and predictable adverse effect given the specified antigen distribution.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Severe bone marrow suppression (A) is typical of cytotoxic chemotherapies, not a direct, antigen-driven effect of CAR T cells.\n- Tumor lysis syndrome and acute kidney injury (B) can occur with rapid tumor kill but are not specifically predicted by HER2’s expression on heart tissue; this is a class effect dependent on tumor burden rather than antigen distribution in healthy tissues.\n- Anaphylaxis from a type I hypersensitivity to infused T cells (D) is unlikely, particularly with autologous cells, and is not a mechanism-based prediction from target distribution.\n- Neurotoxicity from cytokine release (E) is a recognized class effect (ICANS/CRS) of CAR T therapies but is not the most direct and predictable adverse effect stemming from the specified expression of HER2 on cardiomyocytes. The question explicitly anchors the prediction to the antigen’s distribution, pointing to on-target, off-tumor cardiotoxicity.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and predictable major adverse effect in this HER2-targeted CAR T therapy is cardiotoxicity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2282558"}]}
