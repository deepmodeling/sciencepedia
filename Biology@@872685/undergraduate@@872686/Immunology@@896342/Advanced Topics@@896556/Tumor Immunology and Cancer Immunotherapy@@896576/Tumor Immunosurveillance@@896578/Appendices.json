Upon molecular analysis of the tumor cells, they discover a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the gene that codes for the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) protein. All nucleated somatic cells normally process a sample of their internal proteins, known as endogenous antigens, and display fragments of them on their surface to be surveyed by the immune system. This process is fundamental for the detection and elimination of cancerous or virally infected cells by Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs), which recognize these fragments when they are presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules.\n\nGiven this specific mutation, which of the following describes the most direct and significant consequence for the antigen presentation capabilities of these melanoma cells?\n\nA.

To answer this, we must review the canonical MHC class I antigen presentation pathway.\n\n**Step 1: The MHC Class I Pathway for Endogenous Antigens**\nThe MHC class I pathway is responsible for presenting peptides from endogenous proteins, which are proteins synthesized within the cell's own cytoplasm. In a cancer cell, this includes mutated or overexpressed proteins that can act as tumor antigens.\n\n1.  **Protein Degradation**: Endogenous proteins are constantly being turned over. Proteins targeted for degradation are ubiquitinated and then broken down into short peptide fragments by a large, cylindrical protease complex in the cytoplasm called the proteasome.\n2.  **Peptide Transport**: These peptide fragments must be transported from the cytoplasm into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where new MHC class I molecules are being synthesized.\n3.  **The Role of TAP**: This transport step is actively mediated by the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP). TAP is a heterodimeric protein (composed of TAP1 and TAP2 subunits) embedded in the ER membrane, forming a channel that specifically pumps peptides from the cytoplasm into the ER.\n4.  **MHC Class I Loading**: Inside the ER, newly synthesized MHC class I heavy chains associate with a smaller protein called beta-2 microglobulin. This complex is held in a receptive state by a group of chaperone proteins, collectively known as the peptide-loading complex, which includes TAP itself. When a peptide of the appropriate length and sequence is transported into the ER by TAP, it binds to the peptide-binding groove of the MHC class I molecule.\n5.  **Surface Expression**: The binding of a peptide stabilizes the MHC class I molecule, which is then released from the peptide-loading complex and transported through the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface.\n6.  **Immune Surveillance**: On the cell surface, the peptide-MHC class I complex can be recognized by the T-cell receptor of a CD8+ Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL). If the peptide is recognized as foreign (e.g., from a virus) or abnormal (e.g., from a cancerous mutation), the CTL is activated to kill the presenting cell.\n\n**Step 2: Consequence of the TAP Mutation**\nThe problem states there is a loss-of-function mutation in the TAP protein. This means the peptide pump is non-functional.\n\n-   The proteasome will still function correctly, degrading endogenous proteins into peptides in the cytoplasm (disproving option B).\n-   However, these peptides cannot be transported into the endoplasmic reticulum.\n-   Without a supply of peptides in the ER, the newly synthesized MHC class I molecules cannot bind a peptide.\n-   MHC class I molecules that fail to bind a peptide are inherently unstable. They are retained within the ER and eventually targeted for degradation through a process called ER-associated degradation (ERAD).\n-   Therefore, very few, if any, stable MHC class I molecules will ever complete their journey to the cell surface.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating the Options**\n-   **A. An inability to process and load peptides derived from extracellular pathogens onto MHC class II molecules.** This is incorrect. The MHC class II pathway handles *exogenous* antigens (those taken up from outside the cell). This pathway involves endosomes and lysosomes and does not use the TAP protein.\n-   **B. The proteasome in the cytoplasm will be unable to degrade mutated cancer-associated proteins into peptide fragments.** This is incorrect. The proteasome's function is upstream of and independent from TAP's function. The mutation in TAP does not affect protein degradation.\n-   **C. A significant reduction in the quantity of stable, peptide-loaded MHC class I molecules expressed on the cell surface.** This is correct. As explained above, the lack of peptide transport into the ER prevents the stable assembly and subsequent surface expression of MHC class I molecules. This is a classic mechanism of immune evasion by tumors.\n-   **D. A significant increase in the quantity of MHC class I molecules on the cell surface, as they are no longer being loaded with peptides.** This is incorrect. Unloaded MHC class I molecules are unstable and are degraded, not transported to the surface. Their surface expression is therefore dramatically reduced, not increased.\n-   **E. The melanoma cells will present intact, whole proteins on their surface via MHC class I molecules instead of short peptides.** This is incorrect. The binding groove of an MHC class I molecule is physically constrained and can only accommodate short peptides (typically 8-10 amino acids), not intact proteins.\n\nTherefore, the direct and most significant consequence of a non-functional TAP protein is the failure to load MHC class I molecules with peptides, leading to their instability and a drastic reduction in their expression on the cell surface.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2282850"}, {"introduction": "Cancer's evolution is a story of escape. When tumor cells successfully evade detection by $CD8^+$ T cells by downregulating MHC class I expression, the immune system is not out of options. This exercise introduces the crucial role of Natural Killer (NK) cells, which operate on a different logic known as \"missing-self\" recognition.

A patient with metastatic melanoma is found to have a subpopulation of tumor cells that have selectively lost the expression of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules on their surface, while still expressing stress-associated ligands. This adaptation makes them resistant to the primary mechanism of adaptive cytotoxic immunity.\n\nGiven this specific molecular change, which of the following immune cell types would be primarily responsible for recognizing and eliminating these MHC-I-deficient tumor cells?\n\nA.

Neutrophils", "solution": "We identify the immune mechanisms relevant to tumor cell recognition:\n1) Cytotoxic T lymphocytes ($CD8^+$ T cells) require antigenic peptides presented on MHC class I molecules to engage the T cell receptor and mediate killing. If tumor cells lose MHC class I expression, $CD8^+$ T cells cannot recognize them, so this mechanism is evaded.\n2) Helper T lymphocytes ($CD4^+$ T cells) recognize peptides presented on MHC class II. Typical tumor cells, including melanoma cells, do not express MHC class II constitutively, and $CD4^+$ T cells are not the primary cytotoxic effector against MHC class I-deficient tumor cells.\n3) Natural killer (NK) cells integrate inhibitory and activating signals. Inhibitory receptors (such as KIRs) recognize self MHC class I on target cells and suppress NK cell activation. Loss of MHC class I removes this inhibitory signal (“missing-self” recognition). Concurrently, stress-associated ligands on tumor cells (such as MIC-A/B or ULBPs) engage activating receptors on NK cells (such as NKG2D), providing an activating signal (“induced-self”). The combination of missing inhibitory signaling and present activating signaling primes NK cells to recognize and eliminate MHC class I-deficient tumor cells.\n4) B lymphocytes primarily mediate humoral immunity by producing antibodies; they are not the primary effectors for recognizing and killing MHC class I-deficient tumor cells based on missing-self.\n5) Neutrophils are innate phagocytes important for bacterial defense and inflammatory responses; they are not the primary cells that recognize missing-self and stress ligands to kill such tumor cells.\n\nTherefore, the immune cell type primarily responsible for recognizing and eliminating MHC class I-deficient tumor cells that express stress ligands is Natural Killer cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2282831"}, {"introduction": "Immune evasion is not limited to hiding from recognition; tumors can also actively fight back against immune cells.
