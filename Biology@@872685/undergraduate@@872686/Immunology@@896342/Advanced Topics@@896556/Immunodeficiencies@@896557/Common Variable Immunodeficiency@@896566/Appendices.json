She reports being generally healthy in childhood and adolescence. An immunology workup is initiated to investigate a possible primary immunodeficiency. The results of her serum immunoglobulin tests and post-vaccination antibody titers are provided below.

This pattern indicates hypogammaglobulinemia with low IgG and low IgA, with IgM not preserved at a robust normal level.\n\nEvaluate functional antibody responses: The post-vaccination antibody titers show non-protective response to a protein antigen (tetanus toxoid) and a non-protective response to most serotypes of a polysaccharide antigen (pneumococcal polysaccharide). Impaired responses to both protein and polysaccharide antigens indicate a broad defect in humoral immune function.\n\nConsider IgG subclass data: IgG2 is decreased. While this can explain poor polysaccharide responses, an isolated subclass deficiency typically occurs with normal total IgG and often preserved response to protein antigens, which is not the case here.\n\nSynthesize against diagnostic categories:\n1. Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID): Characterized by decreased IgG with decreased IgA and/or IgM, poor specific antibody responses to vaccination, and onset after early childhood. This patient has low IgG and IgA, poor responses to both protein and polysaccharide vaccines, and adult presentation, all consistent with CVID.\n2. Selective IgA Deficiency: Would show isolated low IgA with normal IgG and IgM and typically preserved vaccine responses; this does not fit the patient’s low IgG and poor functional responses.\n3. X-linked Agammaglobulinemia (XLA): Presents in male infants or young boys with profoundly low immunoglobulins and absent B cells; incompatible with this adult female.\n4. Isolated IgG2 Subclass Deficiency: Generally has normal total IgG; often shows impaired response to polysaccharide but preserved response to protein antigens; does not explain low total IgG and poor protein antigen response.\n5.

This problem delves into the concept of locus heterogeneity, a key feature of CVID where mutations in different genes can lead to the same clinical syndrome [@problem_id:2222410].

The genetic basis of CVID is complex and heterogeneous, with multiple genes implicated.\n\nConsider a simplified genetic model for CVID involving two unlinked autosomal genes, which we will call Gene 1 (alleles `A` for wild-type, `a` for mutant) and Gene 2 (alleles `B` for wild-type, `b` for mutant). For both genes, the mutant allele is recessive. An individual will exhibit the CVID phenotype if they are homozygous for the mutant allele in *either* Gene 1 (`aa`) or Gene 2 (`bb`).\n\nA couple seeks genetic counseling. Both partners have been diagnosed with CVID. A detailed genetic workup reveals the following:\n- The male partner's CVID is caused by his genotype for Gene 1. He is also a heterozygous carrier for the mutation in Gene 2. His complete genotype is `aa Bb`.\n- The female partner's CVID is caused by her genotype for Gene 2. She is also a heterozygous carrier for the mutation in Gene 1. Her complete genotype is `Aa bb`.\n\nAssuming the genes assort independently, what is the probability that their child will have CVID?

The inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive, but with locus heterogeneity, meaning a homozygous recessive genotype at either of two unlinked gene loci (Gene 1 or Gene 2) will result in the disease phenotype.\n\nStep 1: Define the condition for the CVID phenotype.\nAn individual has CVID if their genotype is `aa --` (homozygous recessive for Gene 1, any genotype for Gene 2) or `-- bb` (any genotype for Gene 1, homozygous recessive for Gene 2). This also includes the genotype `aa bb`.\n\nStep 2: Identify the genotypes of the parents.\n- Male partner's genotype: `aa Bb`\n- Female partner's genotype: `Aa bb`\n\nStep 3: Determine the possible gametes produced by each parent.\nSince the genes are unlinked, they assort independently. We can determine the gametes for each parent.\n- The male partner (`aa Bb`) can produce two types of gametes. The allele for Gene 1 will always be `a`. The allele for Gene 2 can be `B` or `b` with equal probability.\n  - Gamete 1: `aB` (Probability = 1/2)\n  - Gamete 2: `ab` (Probability = 1/2)\n- The female partner (`Aa bb`) can also produce two types of gametes. The allele for Gene 2 will always be `b`. The allele for Gene 1 can be `A` or `a` with equal probability.\n  - Gamete 1: `Ab` (Probability = 1/2)\n  - Gamete 2: `ab` (Probability = 1/2)\n\nStep 4: Determine the possible genotypes of the offspring and their probabilities.\nWe can use a Punnett square to visualize the combinations of parental gametes.\n\n| Male Gametes | `Ab` (from female, P=1/2) | `ab` (from female, P=1/2) |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **`aB`** (from male, P=1/2) | `Aa Bb` | `aa Bb` |\n| **`ab`** (from male, P=1/2) | `Aa bb` | `aa bb` |\n\nNow we calculate the probability of each of the four possible offspring genotypes:\n- `Aa Bb`: P = P(male `aB`) × P(female `Ab`) = (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4\n- `aa Bb`: P = P(male `aB`) × P(female `ab`) = (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4\n- `Aa bb`: P = P(male `ab`) × P(female `Ab`) = (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4\n- `aa bb`: P = P(male `ab`) × P(female `ab`) = (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total probability of the child having CVID.\nWe identify which of the offspring genotypes result in the CVID phenotype based on the condition from Step 1 (`aa --` or `-- bb`).\n- `Aa Bb`: The individual is heterozygous for both genes. They do not have genotype `aa` or `bb`. Phenotype: Unaffected.\n- `aa Bb`: The individual is homozygous `aa`. Phenotype: CVID.\n- `Aa bb`: The individual is homozygous `bb`. Phenotype: CVID.\n- `aa bb`: The individual is homozygous `aa` and `bb`. Phenotype: CVID.\n\nThe total probability of the child having CVID is the sum of the probabilities of the genotypes that cause the phenotype.\nP(CVID) = P(`aa Bb`) + P(`Aa bb`) + P(`aa bb`)\nP(CVID) = 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 3/4\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the probability of the child being unaffected and subtract it from 1. The only unaffected genotype is `Aa Bb`, which has a probability of 1/4.\nP(CVID) = 1 - P(unaffected) = 1 - P(`Aa Bb`) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.

This therapy consists of regular infusions of a pooled immunoglobulin G (IgG) preparation, which is a concentrated solution of antibodies collected from the plasma of thousands of healthy donors. A significant fraction of the donor population has been exposed to the West Nile Virus (WNV), and as a result, the therapeutic IgG preparation contains WNV-specific antibodies.
