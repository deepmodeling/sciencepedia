This condition is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.\n\nConsider a couple where both individuals are phenotypically healthy but are confirmed to be heterozygous carriers of the recessive allele that causes LAD-I. They are planning to have a family and wish to understand the genetic risks. Assuming that the outcome for each child is an independent event, calculate the probability that if they have four children, at least one of them will be affected by LAD-I.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let 'A' represent the dominant, healthy allele and 'a' represent the recessive allele responsible for Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency, Type I (LAD-I). Since the disorder is autosomal recessive, an individual must have the genotype 'aa' to be affected. Individuals with genotypes 'AA' (homozygous dominant) or 'Aa' (heterozygous) are phenotypically healthy. The problem states that both parents are heterozygous carriers, so their genotype is 'Aa'.\n\nFirst, we determine the probability of a single child being affected by LAD-I. We can use a Punnett square for the cross between two heterozygous parents ('Aa' x 'Aa').\n\nThe possible genotypes for their offspring are:\n- AA (homozygous dominant, unaffected): 1 out of 4 possible outcomes, so the probability is $P(\\text{AA}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- Aa (heterozygous, unaffected carrier): 2 out of 4 possible outcomes, so the probability is $P(\\text{Aa}) = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- aa (homozygous recessive, affected): 1 out of 4 possible outcomes, so the probability is $P(\\text{aa}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nLet $p$ be the probability that a single child is affected with LAD-I.\n$$p = P(\\text{aa}) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nLet $q$ be the probability that a single child is unaffected (either 'AA' or 'Aa').\n$$q = P(\\text{unaffected}) = 1 - p = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\n\nWe need to find the probability that at least one out of four children is affected. Let $X$ be the random variable representing the number of affected children. We want to calculate $P(X \\ge 1)$.\n\nCalculating $P(X \\ge 1)$ directly would involve summing the probabilities of having exactly one, two, three, or four affected children: $P(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X=3) + P(X=4)$.\n\nA more straightforward approach is to calculate the probability of the complementary event, which is that *none* of the four children are affected, i.e., $P(X=0)$, and subtract this from 1.\n$$P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0)$$\n\nThe probability that a single child is unaffected is $q = \\frac{3}{4}$. Since the outcome for each of the four children is an independent event, the probability that all four children are unaffected is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(X=0) = q \\times q \\times q \\times q = q^{4} = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{4}$$\n$$P(X=0) = \\frac{3^{4}}{4^{4}} = \\frac{81}{256}$$\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one child being affected:\n$$P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - \\frac{81}{256}$$\n$$P(X \\ge 1) = \\frac{256}{256} - \\frac{81}{256} = \\frac{256 - 81}{256} = \\frac{175}{256}$$\n\nFinally, we convert this fraction to a decimal and round to three significant figures as requested.\n$$\\frac{175}{256} \\approx 0.68359375$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get 0.684.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.684}$$", "id": "2244291"}, {"introduction": "Moving from genetics to functional diagnostics, this practice explores how immunologists can distinguish between different subtypes of a disease that appear similar clinically. You will analyze hypothetical data from an in-vitro adhesion assay designed to differentiate LAD-I (absence of the integrin protein) from LAD-III (a defect in the signaling that activates the integrin). This exercise demonstrates how specific molecular probes, like manganese ions that bypass cellular signaling, are powerful tools for dissecting protein function and pinpointing the precise molecular cause of a disorder [@problem_id:2244270].", "problem": "An immunologist is investigating two patients, P1 and P2, who both present with recurrent, life-threatening bacterial infections and impaired wound healing. These symptoms are characteristic of a group of genetic disorders known as Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD). The investigation aims to distinguish between LAD-I, caused by a failure to produce the $\\beta_2$ integrin subunit and thus a lack of key adhesion molecules on the neutrophil surface, and LAD-III, caused by a defect in the intracellular signaling pathway required for activating these integrins.\n\nTo achieve this, an *in vitro* adhesion assay is conducted. Neutrophils are isolated from a healthy control subject and from patients P1 and P2. These cells are placed into culture wells coated with a purified form of Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which is the natural ligand for the neutrophil integrin LFA-1 (Lymphocyte Function-associated Antigen-1). The percentage of cells that firmly adhere to the ICAM-1 surface is quantified. This \"Adhesion Efficiency\" is measured under three distinct experimental conditions:\n1.  **Resting:** Cells are incubated in a standard physiological buffer.\n2.  **Chemokine-Stimulated:** Cells are treated with a chemokine, which mimics the physiological signal that triggers \"inside-out\" signaling to activate integrins.\n3.  **Manganese-Treated:** Cells are treated with Manganese(II) chloride ($\\text{MnCl}_2$).
