This practice presents a classic immunological scenario, asking you to predict the fate of a T-cell encountering its antigen on a non-professional antigen-presenting cell. By working through this problem, you can apply the two-signal hypothesis to a realistic biological context and understand why incomplete activation is a critical safety mechanism to prevent autoimmunity [@problem_id:2271400].", "problem": "A naive CD8+ T-cell, which has successfully completed its development in the thymus, circulates through the body. It encounters a skin cell that has been infected with a non-cytopathic virus. As a result of the infection, the skin cell is presenting a specific viral peptide for which the naive T-cell's receptor is specific. This peptide is displayed on the skin cell's Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules. However, being a non-professional antigen-presenting cell, the skin cell does not express the co-stimulatory molecule B7 on its surface.\n\nWhich of the following describes the most immediate and direct immunological outcome for this naive T-cell upon this single encounter?\n\nA. The T-cell becomes activated, proliferates, and differentiates into a cytotoxic T lymphocyte capable of killing infected cells.\n\nB. The T-cell enters a state of anergy, rendering it functionally unresponsive to future encounters with the same antigen.\n\nC. The T-cell is completely unaffected by the interaction and continues to circulate in its naive state.\n\nD. The T-cell immediately undergoes apoptosis (programmed cell death) due to incomplete signaling.\n\nE. The T-cell switches its lineage and differentiates into a CD4+ helper T-cell.", "solution": "The activation of a naive CD8+ T-cell requires two signals:\n- Signal 1: Antigen-specific recognition via the T-cell receptor (TCR) engaging peptide presented on MHC class I on the stimulating cell.\n- Signal 2: Co-stimulatory signaling, classically via CD28 on the T-cell binding B7 (CD80/CD86) on the antigen-presenting cell.\n\nProfessional antigen-presenting cells (e.g., dendritic cells) provide both signals. In contrast, non-professional cells, such as infected skin keratinocytes, present peptide on MHC class I but typically do not express B7.\n\nIn the described encounter:\n- Signal 1 is present: the naive CD8+ T-cell's TCR recognizes its specific viral peptide on MHC class I.\n- Signal 2 is absent: the skin cell lacks B7.\n\nAccording to the two-signal model of T-cell activation, Signal 1 in the absence of Signal 2 induces a tolerogenic outcome, classically anergy, characterized by functional unresponsiveness upon subsequent antigen encounter, rather than productive activation. This is the most immediate and direct consequence of this single encounter.\n\nWhy the other options are incorrect:\n- A is incorrect because activation, proliferation, and differentiation of a naive CD8+ T-cell require co-stimulation and often additional help (e.g., licensed dendritic cells and CD4 help).\n- C is incorrect because TCR engagement without co-stimulation is not a neutral event; it actively induces unresponsiveness rather than leaving the T-cell unchanged.\n- D is incorrect because immediate apoptosis is not the canonical immediate outcome of Signal 1 without Signal 2; deletion is more associated with activation-induced pathways or repeated tolerogenic stimulation.\n- E is incorrect because lineage commitment to CD4 versus CD8 occurs in the thymus and does not switch in the periphery.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and direct outcome is induction of anergy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2271400"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theory to practice, this exercise challenges you to think like an experimental immunologist. Anergy is not merely a lack of response; it is a specific, induced state of long-term unresponsiveness. This problem requires you to design an experiment that can definitively prove the induction of anergy, forcing you to consider the necessary controls and the crucial two-stage process of induction and subsequent challenge [@problem_id:2271430].", "problem": "The activation of a naive T-lymphocyte requires two distinct signals delivered by an Antigen-Presenting Cell (APC). Signal 1 is provided when the T-Cell Receptor (TCR) binds a specific peptide antigen presented on a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecule on the APC surface. Signal 2, a co-stimulatory signal, is typically provided when the CD28 protein on the T-cell surface binds to a B7 family molecule (e.g., CD80 or CD86) on the APC. If a T-cell receives Signal 1 in the absence of Signal 2, it does not become activated but instead enters a state of unresponsiveness called anergy. An anergic T-cell is unable to mount a productive response even if it later encounters an APC providing both signals.\n\nA researcher aims to design an in vitro experiment to demonstrate that the absence of CD28-B7 co-stimulation during initial antigen encounter specifically induces anergy in T-cells. The researcher has the following materials:\n1.  A pure population of naive CD4+ T-cells specific for a known peptide antigen 'X'. These cells express both the specific TCR and CD28.\n2.  A population of professional APCs that express the correct MHC class II molecules and B7 molecules. These APCs can be loaded with peptide X.\n3.  A population of genetically modified \"stimulator cells\" that express the same MHC class II molecules as the APCs and can be loaded with peptide X, but crucially, these cells *do not* express any B7 molecules.\n4.  A reliable assay to measure T-cell activation by quantifying the secretion of the cytokine Interleukin-2 (IL-2).\n\nWhich of the following experimental designs and corresponding expected outcomes would correctly and most completely demonstrate the induction of T-cell anergy due to the lack of co-stimulation?\n\nA. Co-culture the naive T-cells with the B7-deficient stimulator cells loaded with peptide X. The expected outcome is that the T-cells will proliferate and produce high levels of IL-2, as TCR engagement is the primary driver of activation.\n\nB. The experiment is conducted in two stages. In Stage 1, the naive T-cells are co-cultured with the B7-deficient stimulator cells loaded with peptide X. As expected, no significant IL-2 production is observed. In Stage 2, these T-cells are recovered, washed, and then co-cultured with the same B7-deficient stimulator cells again. The expected outcome is that the T-cells will now produce a robust IL-2 response, having been primed in Stage 1.\n\nC. The experiment is conducted in two stages. In Stage 1, two parallel cultures are set up: (i) T-cells with professional APCs loaded with peptide X, and (ii) T-cells with B7-deficient stimulator cells loaded with peptide X. The expected outcome is IL-2 production in culture (i) but not in culture (ii). In Stage 2, T-cells from culture (ii) are recovered, washed, and co-cultured with fresh professional APCs loaded with peptide X. The expected outcome is that these T-cells will fail to produce significant IL-2.\n\nD. The experiment involves three parallel cultures: (i) T-cells alone, (ii) T-cells with professional APCs loaded with peptide X, and (iii) T-cells with B7-deficient stimulator cells loaded with peptide X. The expected outcome is no IL-2 production in culture (i), high IL-2 in culture (ii), and no IL-2 in culture (iii). This difference between (ii) and (iii) is sufficient to prove anergy.\n\nE. The experiment is conducted by co-culturing the naive T-cells with professional APCs loaded with peptide X, but in the presence of a blocking antibody that binds to the TCR. The expected outcome is no IL-2 production. This demonstrates that Signal 1 is necessary, and its absence leads to non-responsiveness, which is equivalent to anergy.", "solution": "First principles:\n- Activation of naive T cells requires two signals: Signal 1 via TCR recognition of peptide-MHC and Signal 2 via co-stimulation (CD28 binding B7). \n- Absence of Signal 2 during initial antigen recognition leads to anergy, defined operationally as a durable state in which the T cell fails to respond (e.g., does not produce IL-2) upon subsequent encounters even when both Signal 1 and Signal 2 are provided.\n- Therefore, to demonstrate anergy specifically due to lack of co-stimulation, an experiment must: (i) expose naive T cells to antigen with Signal 1 but without Signal 2, (ii) show no activation initially, and crucially (iii) show hyporesponsiveness upon restimulation with professional APCs that provide both signals. Appropriate controls must show that naive T cells can respond when co-stimulation is present and that the assay and APCs are functional.\n\nLogical derivation of necessary experimental structure:\n1. Stage 1 exposure condition: Provide Signal 1 without Signal 2 to induce anergy. This is achieved by co-culturing naive antigen-specific T cells with B7-deficient stimulator cells loaded with peptide X. Prediction: minimal or no IL-2 during Stage 1.\n2. Positive control for Stage 1: Parallel culture with professional APCs loaded with peptide X (provide both signals) to verify that naive T cells and the IL-2 assay are functional. Prediction: robust IL-2 in this control.\n3. Stage 2 test for anergy: Recover T cells exposed in Stage 1 to the no co-stimulation condition, wash to remove confounders, then restimulate with fresh professional APCs that provide both signals. Definition of anergy predicts failure to produce IL-2 in this Stage 2 despite full co-stimulation.\n4. Optional but strengthening control: T cells from Stage 1 that did receive co-stimulation should remain responsive upon restimulation, but this is not strictly necessary if Stage 1 already shows the system is functional.\n\nEvaluation of options against the derived criteria:\n- Option A fails because it predicts high IL-2 with Signal 1 only; this contradicts the two-signal requirement and does not test anergy.\n- Option B fails because it predicts that prior exposure to Signal 1 without co-stimulation “primes” T cells to respond upon re-exposure to the same B7-deficient stimulator; this contradicts anergy and does not include a test with full co-stimulation in Stage 2.\n- Option C implements the required two-stage design with appropriate Stage 1 controls and a Stage 2 rechallenge using professional APCs. Expected outcomes match the definition of anergy: IL-2 in the professional APC culture but not in the B7-deficient culture in Stage 1; failure to produce IL-2 upon Stage 2 rechallenge with professional APCs for the T cells previously exposed without co-stimulation.\n- Option D shows only the immediate requirement for co-stimulation (no IL-2 with B7-deficient cells versus high IL-2 with professional APCs) but does not test for durable hyporesponsiveness upon rechallenge; thus it does not demonstrate anergy.\n- Option E tests necessity of Signal 1 by blocking the TCR but does not address the role of co-stimulation nor the durable unresponsive state; non-responsiveness here is not equivalent to anergy.\n\nConclusion: Only Option C both induces anergy by initial Signal 1 without Signal 2 and demonstrates its presence by subsequent failure to respond under full co-stimulatory conditions, with appropriate controls confirming system functionality.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2271430"}, {"introduction": "This advanced practice moves beyond a qualitative understanding to a more quantitative and mechanistic model of anergy induction. By considering how a specific molecular defect—a change in the Lck kinase's affinity for the CD4 co-receptor—affects the signaling strength $\\sigma_1$, you can explore the concept of an \"anergy threshold.\" This exercise highlights how the graded nature of biochemical signals, rather than simple on/off switches, governs complex cellular decisions like T-cell activation versus anergy [@problem_id:2271442].", "problem": "The activation of a naive helper T-cell requires two distinct signals from an Antigen-Presenting Cell (APC). Signal 1 is delivered through the engagement of the T-cell Receptor (TCR) and its co-receptor (e.g., CD4) with a specific peptide-Major Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC) on the APC surface. Signal 2 is a costimulatory signal, typically provided by the interaction of CD28 on the T-cell with B7 molecules on a professional APC. If a T-cell receives Signal 1 in the absence of Signal 2, as is the case when encountering a non-professional APC, it does not become activated but instead enters a state of unresponsiveness known as anergy.\n\nTo model this process, let us consider the following simplified framework. The strength of Signal 1, denoted by $\\sigma_1$, is directly proportional to two factors: the surface concentration of the specific pMHC, denoted as $[pMHC]$, and the effective activity of the lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck). Lck is a critical enzyme that associates with the cytoplasmic tail of the CD4 co-receptor and initiates the intracellular signaling cascade upon TCR/CD4 engagement with pMHC. The effective activity of Lck at the immunological synapse is, in turn, considered to be directly proportional to its binding affinity for the CD4 co-receptor. Anergy is induced if and only if the Signal 1 strength $\\sigma_1$ surpasses a fixed internal anergy-induction threshold, $\\sigma_{anergy}$. The \"anergy threshold\" of the T-cell is defined as the minimum concentration of pMHC, denoted $[pMHC]_{anergy}$, required to induce this state.\n\nNow, consider a T-cell line that has a genetic mutation in the gene encoding Lck. This mutation does not affect the kinase's catalytic function but specifically reduces its binding affinity for the CD4 co-receptor to be 40% of the wild-type affinity. All other cellular parameters, including the anergy-induction threshold $\\sigma_{anergy}$ and TCR affinity for the pMHC, remain unchanged.\n\nHow is the anergy threshold, $[pMHC]_{anergy}$, of this mutant T-cell altered compared to a wild-type T-cell?\n\nA. The anergy threshold is increased.\n\nB. The anergy threshold is decreased.\n\nC. The anergy threshold is unchanged.\n\nD. The T-cell can no longer become anergic under any pMHC concentration.\n\nE. The T-cell is now anergic even in the absence of any pMHC.", "solution": "By the problem statement, Signal 1 strength is proportional to the product of the pMHC concentration and the effective Lck activity. Writing this as an equality with a positive proportionality constant $c$,\n$$\n\\sigma_{1}=c\\,[pMHC]\\,(Lck_{\\text{eff}}).\n$$\nThe effective Lck activity at the synapse is directly proportional to the CD4-Lck binding affinity. Let $K$ denote this affinity. Then\n$$\nLck_{\\text{eff}} \\propto K \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\sigma_{1}=c'\\,[pMHC]\\,K,\n$$\nwhere $c'>0$ absorbs the proportionality constants common to both wild-type and mutant cells.\n\nAnergy is induced when $\\sigma_{1}\\ge \\sigma_{anergy}$. The anergy threshold $[pMHC]_{anergy}$ is defined by equality,\n$$\n\\sigma_{anergy}=c'\\,[pMHC]_{anergy}\\,K \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad [pMHC]_{anergy}=\\frac{\\sigma_{anergy}}{c'\\,K}.\n$$\nFor the wild-type cell, let the affinity be $K_{\\text{wt}}$. For the mutant, the affinity is reduced to a fraction $\\alpha$ of wild-type with $\\alpha=0.4$, so $K_{\\text{mut}}=\\alpha K_{\\text{wt}}$. Therefore,\n$$\n[pMHC]_{anergy}^{\\text{mut}}=\\frac{\\sigma_{anergy}}{c'\\,K_{\\text{mut}}}=\\frac{\\sigma_{anergy}}{c'\\,\\alpha K_{\\text{wt}}}=\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\,\\frac{\\sigma_{anergy}}{c'\\,K_{\\text{wt}}}=\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\,[pMHC]_{anergy}^{\\text{wt}}.\n$$\nSince $\\alpha=0.4$, it follows that $\\frac{1}{\\alpha}>1$, so the mutant requires a higher $[pMHC]$ to reach the same $\\sigma_{1}$ threshold for anergy.
