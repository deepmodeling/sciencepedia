{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The activation of a T-cell is a tightly controlled process designed to launch a potent immune response while preventing accidental attacks on the body's own tissues. This control is achieved through a \"two-signal\" requirement. This first practice problem explores the foundational concept of T-cell anergy, a state of functional unresponsiveness induced when a T-cell receives the first signal (antigen recognition) without the crucial second, co-stimulatory signal. Understanding this principle is essential for grasping how peripheral tolerance is maintained and how it can be therapeutically manipulated [@problem_id:2259655].", "problem": "A patient with a severe autoimmune disorder is enrolled in a clinical trial for a new therapeutic agent. The drug is a monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to the CD28 protein found on the surface of T-lymphocytes. This binding physically obstructs the interaction between CD28 on the T-cell and its corresponding B7 family ligands (e.g., CD80, CD86) expressed on the surface of Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs). An APC is a specialized cell that processes and presents antigens to T-cells.\n\nDuring the course of treatment, the patient is exposed to a novel pathogen. Consider a single naive T-cell within this patient that has not previously encountered its specific antigen. This T-cell's T-cell Receptor (TCR) successfully recognizes and binds to its cognate peptide-antigen complex presented by an APC derived from this new pathogen.\n\nGiven the mechanism of the therapeutic agent, what is the most likely functional fate of this naive T-cell following this initial encounter with its antigen?\n\nA. Clonal expansion and differentiation into effector T-cells.\n\nB. Induction of a long-lived state of functional unresponsiveness.\n\nC. Immediate induction of programmed cell death (apoptosis).\n\nD. Differentiation into a memory T-cell.\n\nE. Maturation into a regulatory T-cell that suppresses other immune responses.", "solution": "The activation of a naive T-cell requires two distinct signals delivered by an Antigen Presenting Cell (APC). First, the T-cell receptor must recognize and bind a specific peptide presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex on the APC (signal 1). Second, a costimulatory signal must be provided through the interaction of CD28 on the T-cell with B7 family ligands (CD80 or CD86) on the APC (signal 2). Both signals are necessary for full activation, clonal expansion, and differentiation into effector cells.\n\nThe therapeutic agent in this scenario is a monoclonal antibody that binds CD28 on T-cells with high affinity, physically preventing its engagement with B7 ligands. Consequently, even though the TCR successfully recognizes its cognate antigen (signal 1 is present), the essential costimulatory signal via CD28 is absent due to the drug’s blockade (signal 2 is missing).\n\nIn naive T-cells, receipt of signal 1 in the absence of signal 2 most commonly induces a state of anergy, defined as long-lived functional unresponsiveness characterized by failure to produce interleukin-2 upon restimulation and impaired proliferative capacity. This is a central tenet of peripheral tolerance and is the canonical outcome of TCR engagement without costimulation in naive T-cells.\n\nBy contrast:\n- Clonal expansion and differentiation into effector T-cells require both signals and therefore will not occur without CD28 costimulation, excluding option A.\n- Immediate programmed cell death can occur under some conditions, but the most typical and primary outcome of signal 1 without signal 2 in naive T-cells is anergy rather than acute apoptosis, making option C less likely.\n- Differentiation into memory T-cells requires successful activation and clonal expansion, which are absent here, excluding option D.\n- Maturation into regulatory T-cells depends on specific cytokine and signaling milieus (e.g., transforming growth factor beta and interleukin-2) and is not the default consequence of absent costimulation; additionally, CD28 signals generally support Treg homeostasis rather than their default induction under costimulatory blockade, making option E inappropriate.\n\nTherefore, the most likely functional fate of the naive T-cell after this initial encounter is induction of a long-lived state of functional unresponsiveness (anergy).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2259655"}, {"introduction": "Beyond inducing unresponsiveness in potentially self-reactive T-cells, the immune system employs a specialized cellular police force known as Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) to actively suppress immune responses. This exercise delves into the molecular machinery that Tregs use to perform their duties, focusing on the inhibitory receptor CTLA-4. By examining a hypothetical mutation, this problem [@problem_id:2259687] challenges you to dissect the sophisticated, contact-dependent mechanisms that make Tregs such potent guardians of self-tolerance.", "problem": "In an immunological study, a genetically engineered mouse model is created to investigate the specific mechanisms of peripheral T-cell tolerance. These mice have Regulatory T cells (Tregs) that express a mutant form of Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). Normally, Treg-mediated suppression of Conventional T cells (Tconvs) relies on contact-dependent mechanisms involving CTLA-4. One key mechanism is that the high-affinity CTLA-4 on Tregs outcompetes the lower-affinity CD28 on Tconvs for binding to the costimulatory ligands CD80 and CD86 on Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs), thereby inhibiting Tconv activation. A second critical mechanism involves the CTLA-4-mediated removal and internalization of CD80/CD86 from the surface of APCs by the Treg, a process known as trans-endocytosis, which depletes the APC of its ability to provide costimulation.\n\nThe specific mutation introduced into the CTLA-4 protein in this mouse model is located in its cytoplasmic tail. This mutation completely prevents the endocytosis (internalization) of the CTLA-4 molecule from the Treg cell surface, but it does not affect its surface expression level or its extracellular domain's ability to bind to CD80 and CD86.\n\nYou perform an in-vitro suppression assay where you co-culture Tconvs, APCs, and either wild-type Tregs or the mutant Tregs. Based on the known functions of CTLA-4, what is the most likely outcome regarding the contact-dependent suppressive capacity of the Tregs expressing the non-internalizing CTLA-4 compared to wild-type Tregs?\n\nA. The suppressive capacity of the mutant Tregs is completely abolished.\n\nB. The suppressive capacity of the mutant Tregs is significantly enhanced.\n\nC. The suppressive capacity of the mutant Tregs is partially reduced.\n\nD. The suppressive capacity of the mutant Tregs is unchanged.\n\nE. The mutant Tregs switch from a suppressive to an activating phenotype.", "solution": "We proceed by explicit consideration of the two established, contact-dependent CTLA-4–mediated suppressive mechanisms of Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and how the stated mutation affects each mechanism.\n\n1) Mechanism 1: Competitive ligand binding. CTLA-4 on Tregs has higher affinity than CD28 on Conventional T cells (Tconvs) for the APC ligands CD80 and CD86. By binding these ligands, CTLA-4 outcompetes CD28 and thereby reduces costimulatory signaling to Tconvs. In the described mutant, the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 is intact and retains normal binding to CD80/CD86. The mutation does not reduce surface expression levels. Therefore, this competitive binding mechanism remains functional.\n\n2) Mechanism 2: Trans-endocytosis of CD80/CD86 from APCs. CTLA-4 on Tregs can remove CD80/CD86 from APC surfaces via trans-endocytosis, requiring the CTLA-4 cytoplasmic tail and its endocytic motifs for internalization. The mutation described is in the CTLA-4 cytoplasmic tail and completely prevents endocytosis. Consequently, the trans-endocytosis mechanism is specifically abolished.\n\n3) Predicted net effect on suppression. Since mechanism 1 (competition for ligands) remains intact while mechanism 2 (ligand removal via trans-endocytosis) is eliminated, the overall contact-dependent suppressive capacity is expected to be reduced relative to wild-type, but not abolished. The mutation does not enhance suppression because it does not increase binding affinity or surface levels beyond wild-type and removes a major suppressive pathway. It does not leave suppression unchanged because a key mechanism is lost. It does not convert Tregs to an activating phenotype because CTLA-4 still competes for ligands and does not deliver costimulatory signals.\n\n4) Mapping to options:\n- A (completely abolished): incorrect, because competitive binding remains.\n- B (significantly enhanced): incorrect, no gain-of-function; one mechanism is lost.\n- C (partially reduced): correct, one mechanism intact, one lost.\n- D (unchanged): incorrect, loss of trans-endocytosis reduces suppression.\n- E (switch to activating): incorrect, CTLA-4 does not mediate activation and competition persists.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is a partial reduction in contact-dependent suppressive capacity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2259687"}, {"introduction": "While tolerance mechanisms are vital for preventing autoimmunity, they can be subverted by chronic diseases like cancer to create a shield against immune attack. This leads to a state of T-cell exhaustion, where immune cells that infiltrate a tumor lose their ability to fight it. This final practice [@problem_id:2259692] investigates this phenomenon by focusing on the inhibitory receptor LAG-3, a key player in T-cell exhaustion. By analyzing this clinical scenario, you will explore how tumors exploit these \"off-switches\" to evade destruction.", "problem": "A clinical immunologist is studying the mechanisms of immune evasion in a patient with metastatic melanoma. Analysis of the tumor microenvironment reveals a significant population of Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs), which are T-cells that have penetrated the tumor mass. Despite their presence, the tumor continues to grow. Further investigation using flow cytometry and gene expression profiling shows that a large fraction of these TILs, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, are in a state of exhaustion, characterized by poor effector function. A key molecular finding is the abnormally high surface expression of the inhibitory receptor Lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3, also known as CD223) on these exhausted T-cells. To understand the functional consequences of this observation, it is crucial to identify the primary molecular interaction driving this inhibitory pathway.\n\nWhich one of the following statements most accurately describes the primary ligand for LAG-3 and the direct consequence of their binding, leading to the T-cell exhaustion observed in this patient?\n\nA. LAG-3 binds to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells or some tumor cells, delivering an inhibitory signal that suppresses T-cell activation and cytokine secretion.\n\nB. LAG-3 binds to the B7 family molecule Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells, which synergizes with the PD-1 receptor to more effectively inhibit T-cell receptor signaling.\n\nC. LAG-3 binds to the co-stimulatory molecule CD28 on the same T-cell, acting as a competitive inhibitor that prevents the binding of CD80/CD86 and blocks essential survival signals.\n\nD. LAG-3 functions as a co-receptor for the T-cell Receptor (TCR), binding to MHC class I molecules with higher affinity than CD8, thereby causing an excessively strong signal that leads to activation-induced cell death.\n\nE. LAG-3 is a receptor for the cytokine Interleukin-10 (IL-10), and its activation by tumor-secreted IL-10 initiates a signaling cascade that directly upregulates transcription factors associated with anergy.", "solution": "We are asked to identify the primary ligand for LAG-3 (CD223) and the direct functional consequence of their interaction that explains T-cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment.\n\nFirst, LAG-3 is an inhibitory immune checkpoint receptor expressed on activated and exhausted T cells, including both CD4^{+} and CD8^{+} subsets. Its canonical and primary ligand is Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHC class II). LAG-3 binds MHC class II with higher affinity than CD4, and this interaction transduces an inhibitory signal that dampens T-cell receptor signaling. The downstream consequence is reduced T-cell activation, proliferation, and effector functions, including decreased cytokine secretion such as interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma. This mechanism contributes to the exhausted phenotype of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n\nA. LAG-3 binds MHC class II on antigen-presenting cells and sometimes on tumor cells, generating an inhibitory signal that suppresses T-cell activation and cytokine secretion. This accurately states both the primary ligand (MHC class II) and the direct inhibitory consequence consistent with T-cell exhaustion. This matches known biology.\n\nB. LAG-3 does not bind PD-L1. PD-L1 is the ligand for PD-1, not LAG-3. Although LAG-3 and PD-1 pathways can be co-expressed and functionally synergistic in exhaustion, there is no direct LAG-3–PD-L1 binding.\n\nC. LAG-3 does not bind CD28 and does not competitively block CD28 interactions. The inhibitory checkpoint that competes with CD28 for CD80/CD86 is CTLA-4, not LAG-3.\n\nD. LAG-3 is not a co-receptor for the TCR that binds MHC class I; the co-receptor for MHC class I is CD8. LAG-3’s canonical ligand is MHC class II, and its effect is inhibitory, not activation-induced cell death due to excessive signaling.\n\nE. LAG-3 is not a receptor for IL-10. IL-10 signals through the IL-10 receptor complex; LAG-3 is unrelated to IL-10 receptor function.\n\nTherefore, the statement that best matches established immunology is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2259692"}]}
