This exercise delves into the molecular mechanics of this choice, using a simplified quantitative model of alternative RNA splicing to explore how a single regulatory protein can act as a critical switch. By modeling this process, you will see what happens when the regulatory mechanism is broken, preventing the cell from becoming an antibody factory [@problem_id:2261107].", "problem": "The differentiation of a B lymphocyte into an antibody-secreting plasma cell involves a crucial change in the processing of the Immunoglobulin M (IgM) heavy chain pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). In naive B cells, alternative splicing favors the production of a membrane-bound form of IgM (mIgM). Upon activation, the splicing machinery shifts to predominantly produce a secreted form (sIgM).\n\nConsider a simplified model for this regulation. A single Splicing Regulator Protein (SRP) governs the choice between the two splice forms. The μ heavy chain pre-mRNA contains a critical intronic silencer sequence.\n1.  When unphosphorylated SRP binds to this silencer, it represses the splicing pathway for sIgM and promotes the pathway for mIgM.\n2.  Upon B-cell activation, a specific kinase phosphorylates SRP. This phosphorylated SRP (pSRP) is unable to bind the silencer, which de-represses the sIgM pathway, leading to high levels of antibody secretion.\n\nLet's quantify this model. The rate of production of sIgM mRNA is proportional to the fraction of silencer sites that are unbound by SRP, while the rate of mIgM mRNA production is proportional to the fraction of bound sites. The ratio of the maximal production rate for the secreted form to the membrane form is a constant, $\\alpha = r_s / r_m$. The binding of unphosphorylated SRP to the silencer is a reversible process at equilibrium with a dissociation constant $K_D$.\n\nIn a healthy, stimulated B cell, the phosphorylation reaction $SRP \\rightleftharpoons pSRP$ is also at equilibrium, characterized by the constant $K_p = [pSRP] / [SRP]$, where $[SRP]$ and $[pSRP]$ are the equilibrium concentrations of the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms, respectively. The total cellular concentration of the SRP protein (in both forms combined) is $[SRP]_T$.\n\nA patient presents with an immunodeficiency. Genetic analysis reveals a mutation in the gene for SRP that prevents its phosphorylation, even though the kinase is fully active. Assume $[SRP]_T$ is the same in the patient's cells and healthy cells.\n\nLet the \"secretion ratio\" $R$ be defined as the ratio of the production rate of sIgM mRNA to that of mIgM mRNA. Find a symbolic expression for the ratio $R_{patient} / R_{healthy}$, which compares the secretion ratio in the patient's stimulated B cells to that of a healthy individual's stimulated B cells.", "solution": "Let the silencer site be denoted by S and its complex with unphosphorylated SRP by C.
