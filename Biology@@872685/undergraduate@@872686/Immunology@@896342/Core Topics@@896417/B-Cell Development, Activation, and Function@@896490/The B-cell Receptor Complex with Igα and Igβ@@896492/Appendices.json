By determining the minimal genetic toolkit required, you will reinforce your understanding of which components are essential for antigen binding, surface expression, and signal transduction [@problem_id:2273703].", "problem": "A cell biologist aims to study the signaling cascade initiated by the B-cell Receptor (BCR) complex in a controlled environment. They choose a fibroblast cell line, which does not naturally express any components of the BCR. To reconstitute a functional BCR complex—one that is expressed on the cell surface and is capable of initiating a signal upon antigen binding—the biologist plans to transfect the fibroblasts with a specific set of genes.\n\nWhich of the following represents the minimal set of genes that must be successfully transfected and expressed to achieve this goal?\n\nA) A gene for the membrane-bound form of an Immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain and a gene for an Ig light chain.\n\nB) A gene for the membrane-bound form of an Ig heavy chain, a gene for an Ig light chain, and the gene encoding Igα (also known as CD79a).\n\nC) The gene encoding Igα (CD79a) and the gene encoding Igβ (also known as CD79b).\n\nD) A gene for the membrane-bound form of an Ig heavy chain, a gene for an Ig light chain, the gene encoding Igα (CD79a), and the gene encoding Igβ (CD79b).\n\nE) A gene for the membrane-bound form of an Ig heavy chain, a gene for an Ig light chain, the gene encoding Igα (CD79a), the gene encoding Igβ (CD79b), and a gene for the tyrosine kinase Lyn.", "solution": "The B-cell receptor (BCR) complex that mediates antigen recognition and initiates signaling consists of two functional modules: \n(1) the antigen-binding component, which is the membrane-bound immunoglobulin (mIg) composed of an Ig heavy chain in its membrane-bound form paired with an Ig light chain; and \n(2) the signaling module, which is the heterodimer of Igα (CD79a) and Igβ (CD79b), each containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in their cytoplasmic tails.\n\nPrinciple 1: Antigen binding requires a complete immunoglobulin molecule, i.e., an Ig heavy chain paired with an Ig light chain, with the heavy chain in its membrane-bound form to anchor the receptor to the plasma membrane.\n\nPrinciple 2: Surface expression of the BCR requires association of mIg with the Igα/Igβ heterodimer. The mIg heavy chain’s short cytoplasmic tail lacks the signals necessary for proper transport and surface expression; without Igα/Igβ, mIg is not efficiently expressed on the cell surface.\n\nPrinciple 3: Signal initiation upon antigen binding requires the ITAMs present in the cytoplasmic domains of Igα and Igβ. Crosslinking of the BCR leads to phosphorylation of these ITAMs by Src-family kinases. While Lyn is the canonical Src-family kinase in B cells, fibroblasts generally express endogenous Src-family kinases (for example, Src, Fyn, or Yes), which can phosphorylate ITAMs and initiate downstream signaling. Therefore, exogenous Lyn is not required for minimal reconstitution of signaling competence.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A lacks Igα/Igβ, so it would not support proper surface expression or signaling.\n- B includes Igα but omits Igβ; both are required as a heterodimer for assembly, transport, and signaling.\n- C includes Igα/Igβ but lacks the antigen-binding mIg (heavy and light chains), so no receptor is present to bind antigen.\n- D includes the membrane Ig heavy chain, the Ig light chain, and both Igα and Igβ, which together are necessary and sufficient for a surface-expressed, signaling-competent BCR.\n- E adds Lyn, which is not minimally required because endogenous Src-family kinases in fibroblasts can fulfill the kinase role for ITAM phosphorylation.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of genes necessary to reconstitute a functional, surface-expressed, signaling BCR in fibroblasts is the membrane-bound Ig heavy chain, the Ig light chain, Igα (CD79a), and Igβ (CD79b).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2273703"}, {"introduction": "Having identified the essential components of the BCR, we now explore the critical division of labor within the complex. This practice presents a thought experiment where the antigen-binding surface immunoglobulin is functionally uncoupled from its signaling partners, Igα and Igβ. Analyzing the outcome of this separation will clarify why the physical association between these modules is absolutely required to translate antigen recognition into a cellular response [@problem_id:2273667].", "problem": "In a laboratory experiment, a genetic engineering technique is used to modify a mature B lymphocyte. The modification specifically alters the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the B cell's surface-bound immunoglobulin (sIg), which is the primary component of the B-cell receptor (BCR). This alteration completely prevents the sIg from physically associating with its crucial signaling partners, the Igα/Igβ heterodimer (also known as CD79a/CD79b). The antigen-binding regions of the sIg molecule remain unaltered and fully functional.\n\nThese engineered B cells are then placed in a culture with an optimal concentration of their specific antigen. What is the most likely functional outcome for these B cells following exposure to the antigen?\n\nA. The B cells will be unable to bind to the antigen, as the Igα/Igβ heterodimer is essential for stabilizing the antigen-binding site.\n\nB. The B cells will bind the antigen and immediately undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) due to the incomplete signaling event.\n\nC. The B cells will bind the antigen, but will fail to initiate the intracellular signaling cascade necessary for their activation, proliferation, and differentiation.\n\nD. The B cells will bind the antigen and proceed with normal activation, proliferation, and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells.", "solution": "The B-cell receptor (BCR) consists of two functionally distinct parts: the surface immunoglobulin (sIg), which contains the antigen-binding variable regions, and the associated signaling heterodimer Igα/Igβ (CD79a/CD79b), which contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in their cytoplasmic tails. The sIg heavy chain cytoplasmic tail is extremely short and lacks signaling motifs, so antigen binding by sIg alone cannot initiate intracellular signaling. Instead, upon antigen-induced BCR clustering, Src-family kinases phosphorylate the ITAMs on Igα/Igβ, recruiting Syk and initiating downstream signaling cascades (including activation of BLNK, BTK, PLCγ2, calcium flux, and transcription factors such as NF-κB, NFAT, and AP-1) that drive B-cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation.\n\nIn the engineered cells, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of sIg are altered specifically to prevent physical association with Igα/Igβ, while the antigen-binding sites remain intact and fully functional. Therefore:\n1. Antigen binding will still occur, because this depends on the extracellular variable regions of sIg, which are unaltered. Igα/Igβ does not stabilize the antigen-binding site; it mediates signaling.\n2. Signal transduction will fail, because the physical coupling between sIg and Igα/Igβ is required to transmit antigen binding into ITAM phosphorylation and downstream signaling. Without association, there is no phosphorylation of Igα/Igβ ITAMs, no Syk recruitment, and no downstream activation pathway.\n3. As a result, the cells will not undergo normal activation, proliferation, or differentiation. Immediate apoptosis upon antigen binding is not the expected outcome; rather, the dominant effect here is failure to initiate the intracellular signaling cascade. Over time, lack of BCR signaling can lead to non-responsiveness or loss, but the defining functional outcome in this setup is failure to activate despite antigen binding.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: antigen binding does not require Igα/Igβ.\n- B is incorrect: immediate apoptosis due to incomplete signaling is not the primary, necessary outcome.\n- C is correct: binding occurs, but intracellular signaling necessary for activation, proliferation, and differentiation fails.\n- D is incorrect: normal activation requires intact Igα/Igβ-mediated signaling.\n\nTherefore, the most likely functional outcome is described by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2273667"}, {"introduction": "This final practice takes our understanding from the level of protein complexes down to the critical function of a single amino acid. We examine a hypothetical immunodeficiency caused by a subtle mutation within an Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motif (ITAM) of the Igα chain. By diagnosing the molecular failure at the heart of this condition, you will gain a precise appreciation for how the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues serves as the master switch for initiating the entire B-cell activation cascade [@problem_id:2273680].", "problem": "The activation of a B cell is initiated by the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex. This complex consists of a membrane-bound immunoglobulin (mIg), which is responsible for antigen binding, and an associated heterodimer of two transmembrane proteins, Igα (CD79a) and Igβ (CD79b). The primary function of the Igα/Igβ heterodimer is to transduce signals into the cell after the mIg has bound to an antigen. The cytoplasmic tails of both Igα and Igβ contain conserved sequences known as Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs (ITAMs). These ITAMs are essential for signaling and contain specific tyrosine residues that become phosphorylated by cellular kinases.\n\nConsider a patient with a rare form of inherited immunodeficiency. Genetic analysis reveals that the patient's B cells harbor a specific point mutation in the gene encoding the Igα protein. This mutation results in the substitution of a single, critical tyrosine residue within an ITAM motif with a phenylalanine residue. Assume that all other components of the B cell's signaling machinery, including the Igβ protein, are normal, and the mutant Igα protein is expressed and correctly assembled into the BCR complex on the cell surface.\n\nWhich of the following statements describes the most direct molecular consequence of this specific tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutation, leading to the failure of B-cell activation?\n\nA.

The mutation disrupts the non-covalent association between the Igα/Igβ heterodimer and the membrane-bound immunoglobulin (mIg).\n\nE. The mutation causes the entire BCR complex to be constitutively internalized and degraded, even in the absence of antigen.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most direct molecular consequence of a tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutation within an Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motif (ITAM) of the Igα subunit of the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex. To determine the correct answer, we must analyze the canonical B-cell activation signaling cascade step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: The Normal B-Cell Activation Cascade**\n1.  **Antigen Binding and Cross-linking:** The process begins when a multivalent antigen binds to and cross-links multiple mIg molecules on the B-cell surface. This brings the associated Igα/Igβ heterodimers into close proximity.\n2.  **ITAM Phosphorylation by Src-family Kinases:** This clustering allows a constitutively associated Src-family kinase, primarily Lyn, to become activated. Activated Lyn then phosphorylates the specific tyrosine residues located within the ITAMs on the cytoplasmic tails of both Igα and Igβ.\n3.  **Recruitment and Activation of Syk:** The now doubly-phosphorylated ITAMs act as high-affinity docking sites for another critical kinase, the Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). Syk possesses two tandem Src Homology 2 (SH2) domains, which specifically recognize and bind to phosphotyrosine residues. The binding of Syk to the two phosphorylated tyrosines in an ITAM brings multiple Syk molecules close together, leading to their trans-autophosphorylation and full activation.\n4.  **Downstream Signaling:** Activated Syk then phosphorylates a number of downstream adaptor proteins and enzymes (such as BLNK/SLP-65 and PLC-γ2), propagating the signal through various pathways that ultimately lead to changes in gene expression, B-cell proliferation, and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Specific Mutation**\nThe mutation described is a substitution of a tyrosine with a phenylalanine residue.\n*   **Tyrosine:** An amino acid with a side chain containing a phenol group (a benzene ring with a hydroxyl `-OH` group). This hydroxyl group is the site of phosphorylation.\n*   **Phenylalanine:** An amino acid with a side chain containing a phenyl group (a benzene ring). It is structurally similar to tyrosine but critically lacks the hydroxyl group.\n\nBecause phenylalanine does not have a hydroxyl group, it cannot be a substrate for a tyrosine kinase like Lyn. Therefore, the ITAM motif containing this mutation cannot be phosphorylated at this specific site.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Consequence of the Mutation on the Cascade**\nSince the tyrosine residue in the Igα ITAM cannot be phosphorylated, the ITAM motif cannot become a complete, high-affinity docking site. The SH2 domains of Syk specifically require phosphotyrosine for binding. Without this key phosphorylation event, Syk cannot be stably recruited to the cytoplasmic tail of the Igα protein at the BCR complex. Consequently, Syk is not activated, and the entire downstream signaling cascade is blocked at this crucial step. This failure to transduce the initial antigen-binding signal results in immunodeficiency.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\n*   **A. The mutation prevents the membrane-bound immunoglobulin (mIg) portion of the BCR from binding to its cognate antigen.** This is incorrect. Antigen binding is the function of the extracellular variable domains of the mIg, which is a separate protein. The mutation is in the cytoplasmic tail of Igα and has no effect on the antigen-binding site.\n*   **B. The mutation directly inhibits the catalytic activity of the Src-family kinase Lyn, preventing it from phosphorylating any substrates.** This is incorrect. Lyn is the kinase that acts *upstream* on the ITAM. The mutation affects the *substrate* (the tyrosine), not the *enzyme* (Lyn). Lyn's catalytic activity remains intact, but it has no hydroxyl group to phosphorylate at the mutated site.\n*   **C. The mutation prevents the stable recruitment and subsequent activation of the Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) at the receptor complex.** This is correct. As explained in Step 3, Syk recruitment is directly dependent on the phosphorylation of the ITAM tyrosines. Because the phenylalanine cannot be phosphorylated, Syk cannot dock onto the mutated ITAM, and the signal is not propagated. This is the most direct and critical consequence of the mutation.\n*   **D. The mutation disrupts the non-covalent association between the Igα/Igβ heterodimer and the membrane-bound immunoglobulin (mIg).** This is incorrect. The problem states the mutant BCR complex is correctly assembled on the cell surface. The association between these components occurs primarily within their transmembrane domains and is not dependent on the phosphorylation state of the cytoplasmic tails.\n*   **E. The mutation causes the entire BCR complex to be constitutively internalized and degraded, even in the absence of antigen.** This is incorrect. This describes a defect in protein trafficking or stability, not signaling. While signaling can lead to receptor internalization, this mutation's primary effect is to block the initiation of that signal, not to cause constitutive internalization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2273680"}]}
