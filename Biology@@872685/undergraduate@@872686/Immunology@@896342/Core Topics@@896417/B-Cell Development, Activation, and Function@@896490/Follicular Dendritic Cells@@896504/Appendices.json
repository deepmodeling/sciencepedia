In the bustling microenvironment of a germinal center, follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) are a rare, non-hematopoietic population surrounded by a sea of lymphocytes. This exercise challenges you to think like an experimental immunologist and select a specific cell surface marker to uniquely identify FDCs, a critical first step for studying their role in immunity [@problem_id:2229000].", "problem": "An immunologist is studying the cellular dynamics within a germinal center of a lymph node. The goal is to isolate and characterize the Follicular Dendritic Cells (FDCs), a unique stromal cell population critical for B cell affinity maturation. The researcher has a mixed cell suspension from the germinal center, which predominantly contains B cells, T cells, and the FDCs of interest. To differentiate the FDCs from the abundant B cell population using flow cytometry, the researcher needs to select an appropriate cell surface marker.\n\nWhich one of the following cell surface markers would be most effective for positively identifying the FDC population while simultaneously excluding the germinal center B cells?\n\nA. CD19\n\nB. CD3\n\nC. Surface Immunoglobulin M (IgM)\n\nD. CD45\n\nE. CD35 (Complement Receptor 1)", "solution": "We need a marker that is present on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) and not on germinal center B cells, allowing positive identification of FDCs while excluding B cells by absence on B cells.\n\n- CD19 (option A) is a pan-B-cell marker expressed on B cells, not on FDCs; using it would identify B cells, not FDCs.\n- CD3 (option B) is a T-cell marker, not expressed on FDCs or B cells, so it neither identifies FDCs nor specifically excludes B cells in a positive fashion.\n- Surface IgM (option C) is a B-cell receptor component present on naive B cells; germinal center B cells often have undergone class switching and may have reduced or absent surface IgM. Regardless, it marks B cells, not FDCs, and thus does not positively identify FDCs.\n- CD45 (option D) is the leukocyte common antigen expressed on hematopoietic cells, including B cells and T cells, but FDCs are non-hematopoietic stromal cells and are CD45 negative. While CD45 negativity can help exclude leukocytes, it does not provide a positive marker for FDCs.\n- CD35 (Complement Receptor 1; option E) is highly expressed on FDCs and is used to trap immune complexes; although some B cells can express complement receptors, FDCs characteristically show strong expression of CD35. Among the listed options, CD35 is the most effective for positively identifying FDCs and, in practical gating strategies, distinguishes them from germinal center B cells when used as a positive marker.\n\nTherefore, the best single marker from the provided choices to positively identify FDCs while excluding germinal center B cells is CD35 (CR1).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2229000"}, {"introduction": "A defining feature of FDCs is their ability to act as a long-term antigen library for B cells. This function depends on specialized receptors that trap and display intact antigens for months. This problem presents a hypothetical genetic scenario to probe your understanding of this crucial mechanism, asking you to predict the consequences of disabling the complement receptor system on FDCs and its impact on the germinal center response [@problem_id:2228950].", "problem": "Follicular Dendritic Cells (FDCs) are specialized stromal cells residing within the B-cell follicles of secondary lymphoid organs. A key function of FDCs is to create a long-term reservoir of intact antigens, which is critical for the selection and affinity maturation of B cells during a Germinal Center (GC) reaction. FDCs trap antigens through two primary receptor systems. One involves receptors for the Fc portion of antibodies, and the other involves receptors for complement components.\n\nConsider an experimental mouse strain that has a targeted genetic mutation rendering its FDCs incapable of expressing the complement receptors CD21 (also known as CR2) and CD35 (also known as CR1). All other FDC functions, including the expression of Fc receptors and the production of survival factors, remain normal. Based on this specific molecular defect, which of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate and primary consequence for antigen handling in these mice?\n\nA. The trapping of antigens opsonized with complement fragments, such as C3d and C3b, will be severely impaired, likely leading to a weaker and less sustained germinal center response.\n\nB. FDCs will be unable to process and present peptide antigens via MHC class II molecules, thus failing to provide activation signals to T follicular helper cells.\n\nC. The trapping of pre-existing immune complexes, composed of antigen and IgG antibodies, will be completely abolished.\n\nD. FDCs will lose the ability to express the chemokine CXCL13, leading to a failure of B cells to migrate into and organize within the B-cell follicle.", "solution": "FDCs serve as a reservoir of intact, native antigens in B-cell follicles by trapping immune complexes on their surface. This trapping is mediated primarily by two receptor systems: Fc receptors that bind the Fc portion of antibodies in immune complexes, and complement receptors that bind complement fragments deposited on antigens.\n\nCD21 (CR2) and CD35 (CR1) are the principal complement receptors on FDCs. CR2 binds C3d (and iC3b-derived fragments), while CR1 binds C3b and C4b. Antigen opsonization with complement fragments (especially C3d) enhances its retention on FDCs via these receptors. This complement-dependent trapping is crucial for maintaining a depot of native antigen during germinal center reactions, thereby supporting selection and affinity maturation of B cells.\n\nIn the described mouse, FDCs lack CD21 and CD35, but retain normal Fc receptor expression and other functions. The immediate and primary consequence is that antigens that rely on complement opsonization (C3b, iC3b, C3d, C4b) for capture will not be efficiently trapped on FDCs. However, Fc receptor-mediated binding of preformed antigen-IgG immune complexes remains intact, so immune complex capture is not abolished. FDCs are not classical antigen-presenting cells for T cells and do not provide MHC class II peptide presentation to T follicular helper cells; that function is executed primarily by dendritic cells and B cells. The mutation is specific to complement receptors and does not affect chemokine production such as CXCL13, which organizes B-cell follicles.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that complement-opsonized antigen trapping is severely impaired, with the likely downstream effect of a weaker and less sustained germinal center response.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2228950"}, {"introduction": "The selection of B cells within the germinal center is a game of probability, where survival depends on the strength and duration of binding to antigen on FDCs. We can translate this biological competition into a quantitative model to better appreciate the principles of affinity maturation. This exercise asks you to apply concepts from probability and kinetics to calculate a B cell's chance of survival, linking the molecular property of a B-cell receptor's off-rate, $k_{off}$, directly to the cell's ultimate fate [@problem_id:2229011].", "problem": "In the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs, B cells undergo a process of affinity maturation to improve the binding strength of their antibodies. This selection process heavily relies on interactions with Follicular Dendritic Cells (FDCs), which present antigens on their surface. A B cell's fate—survival or apoptosis—depends on its ability to efficiently capture antigen from the FDC.\n\nConsider a simplified model for this interaction. A B cell interacts with an FDC for a fixed period, during which it can make a total of $M=4$ independent attempts to bind and acquire an antigen molecule. For an antigen to be successfully \"acquired\" (e.g., internalized for processing), the B-Cell Receptor (BCR) on the B cell surface must remain bound to the antigen for a minimum duration of $\\tau_{acq} = \\ln(3)$ seconds. The dissociation of a single BCR-antigen complex is a first-order kinetic process governed by a dissociation rate constant, $k_{off}$. A specific B cell clone expresses a BCR with an off-rate of $k_{off} = 1.0 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n\nTo receive a pro-survival signal and avoid apoptosis, the B cell must acquire a minimum of $N_{thresh} = 3$ antigen molecules during its interaction with the FDC.\n\nAssuming each binding attempt is an independent event, calculate the probability that this B cell clone will receive the survival signal. Express your answer as an exact fraction in simplest form.", "solution": "Each BCR-antigen complex has a bound lifetime that is exponentially distributed with rate constant $k_{off}$ because dissociation is a first-order process.
