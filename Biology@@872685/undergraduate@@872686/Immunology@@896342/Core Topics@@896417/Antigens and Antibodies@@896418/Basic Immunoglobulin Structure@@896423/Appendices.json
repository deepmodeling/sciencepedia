This practice breaks down the Immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecule into its fundamental components, allowing you to perform a straightforward calculation based on its subunit masses. By determining the molecular weight of a Fragment, antigen-binding (Fab), you will build a quantitative understanding of the relationship between the whole antibody and its crucial antigen-recognition machinery.", "problem": "An Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody is a protein complex crucial for the adaptive immune response. A typical human IgG molecule has a total molecular weight of approximately 150 kiloDaltons (kDa). This structure is composed of four polypeptide chains: two identical heavy chains, each with a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa, and two identical light chains, each with a molecular weight of approximately 25 kDa. The chains are held together by disulfide bonds.\n\nEnzymatic cleavage at a specific site, known as the hinge region, can break the IgG molecule into distinct fragments. One such fragment is the Fragment, antigen-binding (Fab). A single Fab fragment consists of one entire light chain covalently linked to the N-terminal portion of one heavy chain. This heavy chain portion constitutes approximately half of the heavy chain's total mass.\n\nGiven this information, calculate the approximate molecular weight of a single Fab fragment. Express your answer in kiloDaltons (kDa).", "solution": "The goal of the problem is to calculate the molecular weight of a single Fragment, antigen-binding (Fab). We are provided with the molecular weights of the constituent components of an Immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecule.\n\nFirst, let's list the information given in the problem statement:\n- Molecular weight of a single heavy chain, $M_H = 50$ kDa.\n- Molecular weight of a single light chain, $M_L = 25$ kDa.\n- The total molecular weight of an IgG molecule is $M_{IgG} = 150$ kDa. We can verify the consistency of the component weights: $2 \\times M_H + 2 \\times M_L = 2 \\times 50 \\text{ kDa} + 2 \\times 25 \\text{ kDa} = 100 \\text{ kDa} + 50 \\text{ kDa} = 150 \\text{ kDa}$. This matches the given total molecular weight, confirming the data is consistent.\n\nThe problem states that a single Fab fragment is composed of two parts:\n1.  One entire light chain.\n2.  The N-terminal portion of one heavy chain, which has a mass equal to approximately half of the total heavy chain mass.\n\nLet's calculate the mass of the heavy chain portion present in the Fab fragment.\nMass of the heavy chain portion = $\\frac{1}{2} \\times M_H$\nMass of the heavy chain portion = $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 50 \\text{ kDa} = 25 \\text{ kDa}$.\n\nThe total molecular weight of the Fab fragment, $M_{Fab}$, is the sum of the masses of its components.\n$M_{Fab} = (\\text{Mass of one light chain}) + (\\text{Mass of the heavy chain portion})$\n$M_{Fab} = M_L + (\\frac{1}{2} \\times M_H)$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this equation:\n$M_{Fab} = 25 \\text{ kDa} + 25 \\text{ kDa}$\n$M_{Fab} = 50 \\text{ kDa}$\n\nThus, the approximate molecular weight of a single Fab fragment is 50 kDa. The question asks for the answer to be expressed in kDa.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{50}$$", "id": "2218684"}, {"introduction": "While Immunoglobulin G (IgG) serves as the classic model for antibody structure, the immunoglobulin family is diverse. This exercise explores the assembly of multimeric antibodies like Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin A (IgA), which form pentamers and dimers, respectively. By considering a hypothetical scenario where the essential Joining (J) chain is absent, you will probe the rules governing their complex quaternary structure and the consequences of disrupting a key molecular component.", "problem": "In plasma B cells, certain classes of immunoglobulins (antibodies) are assembled into multimeric complexes before secretion. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) is typically secreted as a pentamer (a complex of five monomer units), and secretory Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is secreted as a dimer (a complex of two monomer units). This polymerization is critically dependent on a small protein called the Joining (J) chain, which links the antibody monomers together.\n\nConsider a hypothetical B cell line that has been genetically engineered to completely lack the gene encoding the J chain. These cells successfully mature and are stimulated to produce and secrete both IgM and IgA. Assuming all other cellular machinery for protein synthesis, modification, and secretion is functioning correctly, what are the resulting quaternary structures of the IgM and IgA molecules secreted by these engineered cells?\n\nA. IgM will be a pentamer, and IgA will be a dimer.\n\nB. IgM will be a monomer, and IgA will be a monomer.\n\nC. IgM will be a pentamer, and IgA will be a monomer.\n\nD. IgM will be a monomer, and IgA will be a dimer.\n\nE. Neither IgM nor IgA will be secreted, as polymerization is required for export.", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the normal quaternary structures and the role of the J chain. Secreted IgM is typically a pentamer and secretory IgA is a dimer. Both of these polymeric forms require the Joining (J) chain, which mediates linkage of immunoglobulin monomers via tailpiece cysteines to form higher-order complexes and enables interaction with the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor.\n\nStep 2: Apply the biological principle to the engineered condition. In a B cell line lacking the J chain gene, the J chain protein is absent. Without the J chain, the specific polymerization steps that produce IgM pentamers and IgA dimers cannot occur, because the J chain is required to nucleate and stabilize these polymeric assemblies.\n\nStep 3: Determine secretion competence in the absence of polymerization. The problem states that all other cellular machinery for synthesis, folding, modification, and secretion is intact. Monomeric IgM and monomeric IgA are properly folded Ig molecules that can be secreted without requiring J chain. Therefore, polymerization is not required for export per se; only the polymeric forms require J chain.\n\nStep 4: Conclude the resulting quaternary structures. Without J chain, secreted IgM will not form pentamers and will be secreted as monomers. Similarly, secretory IgA will not form dimers and will be secreted as monomers.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that both IgM and IgA will be monomers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2218685"}, {"introduction": "This final challenge asks you to think from the ground up, like a molecular designer. This thought experiment strips away the complexity of modern antibodies to focus on their essential functional modules: the immunoglobulin domains. By designing a minimalist 'proto-immunoglobulin' from first principles, you will synthesize your knowledge of how distinct domains for antigen binding and effector signaling can be combined into a single, functional protein.", "problem": "An immunologist is tasked with designing a hypothetical, minimalist \"proto-immunoglobulin\" molecule capable of performing two fundamental functions of a modern antibody: specific binding to a target antigen and interaction with a primitive effector receptor on a cell surface. The entire molecule must be constructed from a single continuous polypeptide chain.\n\nThe basic building block for this molecule is the standard Immunoglobulin (Ig) domain. Based on our understanding of modern antibodies, the following functional requirements are established for the proto-immunoglobulin:\n\n1.  **Specific Target Binding**: This function requires the non-covalent association of two distinct variable-type Ig domains: one \"heavy-type\" variable domain (VH) and one \"light-type\" variable domain (VL). A single VH or VL domain alone is insufficient for specific binding.\n2.  **Effector Receptor Interaction**: This function requires a structure analogous to the modern antibody's Fragment crystallizable (Fc) region. For stable interaction with the primitive effector receptor, two distinct constant-type Ig domains are necessary: a \"proximal\" constant domain (analogous to CH2) and a \"distal\" constant domain (analogous to CH3).\n\nGiven these constraints, what is the absolute minimum total number of Ig domains required to construct a single polypeptide chain that fulfills both of these functions?\n\nA. 2\nB. 3\nC. 4\nD. 5\nE. 6", "solution": "We are to design a single continuous polypeptide that can (i) perform specific antigen binding, and (ii) interact with a primitive effector receptor, using standard Immunoglobulin (Ig) domains as building blocks.\n\nBy requirement 1 (Specific Target Binding), specific binding necessitates the non-covalent association of two distinct variable-type Ig domains: one heavy-type variable domain (VH) and one light-type variable domain (VL). A single VH or VL alone is insufficient. Therefore, the minimal number of variable domains needed to realize binding is\n$$\nN_{\\text{bind}}=2.\n$$\nBecause the whole molecule must be a single polypeptide, these two domains can be arranged in tandem with a flexible linker to allow intramolecular non-covalent association (as in a single-chain variable fragment), satisfying the constraint without requiring additional chains or domains.\n\nBy requirement 2 (Effector Receptor Interaction), stable interaction with the primitive effector receptor requires a structure analogous to an Fc region comprising two distinct constant-type Ig domains: a proximal constant domain (CH2-like) and a distal constant domain (CH3-like). Thus, the minimal number of constant domains required for effector function is\n$$\nN_{\\text{eff}}=2.\n$$\nNo additional domains (such as CH1 or CL) are mandated by the stated functional requirements, and multichain assembly is disallowed by the single-polypeptide constraint.\n\nTherefore, to fulfill both functions within a single polypeptide, the absolute minimum total number of Ig domains is the sum of the required variable and constant domains:\n$$\nN_{\\text{total}}=N_{\\text{bind}}+N_{\\text{eff}}=2+2=4.\n$$\nThis corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2218680"}]}
