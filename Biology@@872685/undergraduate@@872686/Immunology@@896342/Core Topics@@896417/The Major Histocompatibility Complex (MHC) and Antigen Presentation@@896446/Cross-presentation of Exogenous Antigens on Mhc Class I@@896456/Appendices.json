{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To initiate a powerful cytotoxic T cell response against viruses, the immune system must solve a critical logistical problem: how can a naive T cell be activated by a virus it has never \"seen,\" especially if that virus doesn't infect the professional antigen-presenting cells that specialize in T cell activation? This exercise [@problem_id:2222708] explores the indispensable role of dendritic cells and the process of cross-presentation in bridging this gap. By considering a hypothetical scenario involving the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP), you will deduce why this specific molecular machinery within dendritic cells is essential for mounting an effective defense.", "problem": "An experimental mouse model is developed to study viral immunity. In this model, the gene encoding the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) has been selectively deleted only in dendritic cells (DCs). All other cell types, including epithelial cells, have functional TAP proteins. These mice are subsequently infected with a virus that primarily infects respiratory epithelial cells but does not infect DCs or other professional antigen-presenting cells. Despite the infected epithelial cells being capable of expressing viral antigens on their cell surface, the mice fail to mount an effective cytotoxic immune response and cannot clear the infection.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and direct explanation for this immunological failure?\n\nA. The dendritic cells are unable to process and present viral antigens on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules, leading to a failure in activating helper T cells.\n\nB. The infected epithelial cells cannot be recognized and killed by Natural Killer (NK) cells because the lack of TAP in dendritic cells globally suppresses NK cell activity.\n\nC. The infected epithelial cells cannot transport their own endogenous viral peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto MHC class I molecules.\n\nD. The dendritic cells cannot activate naive `$CD8^{+}$ T cells because they are unable to load peptides from the exogenous viral antigens onto their MHC class I molecules.\n\nE. The lack of TAP in dendritic cells prevents them from migrating to the lymph nodes to interact with T cells.", "solution": "The key experimental manipulation is the selective deletion of TAP in dendritic cells (DCs), while all other cells, including respiratory epithelial cells, retain functional TAP. The virus infects epithelial cells but does not infect DCs or other professional antigen-presenting cells.\n\nFirst, consider antigen processing pathways. For the MHC class I pathway, endogenous (cytosolic) proteins are degraded by the proteasome, peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum by TAP, loaded onto MHC class I, and displayed to `$CD8^{+}$ T cells. For the MHC class II pathway, exogenous proteins are processed in endosomal/lysosomal compartments and loaded onto MHC class II via the invariant chain/CLIP and HLA-DM; this pathway is independent of TAP.\n\nInfected epithelial cells have functional TAP and therefore can present their endogenous viral peptides on their own MHC class I molecules. However, naive `$CD8^{+}$ T cells are not effectively primed by non-professional APCs such as epithelial cells because these lack necessary costimulatory molecules and do not traffic to lymph nodes to initiate naive T cell activation. Effective priming of naive `$CD8^{+}$ T cells requires DCs presenting antigen on MHC class I with costimulation in secondary lymphoid organs.\n\nBecause the virus does not infect DCs, DCs would need to acquire viral antigens from infected epithelial cells as exogenous material and present them to `$CD8^{+}$ T cells via cross-presentation. The dominant cross-presentation pathway in DCs involves transfer of exogenous antigens into the cytosol, proteasomal degradation, and TAP-dependent transport of the resulting peptides into the ER for loading onto MHC class I. Deletion of TAP specifically in DCs disrupts this cross-presentation pathway, preventing DCs from loading peptides from exogenous viral antigens onto MHC class I and thereby preventing activation (priming) of naive `$CD8^{+}$ T cells. Without primed cytotoxic T lymphocytes, the host fails to clear the infection despite epithelial cells displaying viral peptides.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because MHC class II processing is TAP-independent; helper T cell activation via MHC class II would not be directly impaired by TAP loss.\n- B is incorrect because TAP deficiency in DCs does not globally suppress NK cell activity; moreover, infected epithelial cells with intact MHC class I are not NK targets.\n- C is incorrect because epithelial cells have functional TAP and can present endogenous viral peptides on MHC class I.\n- D is correct because DCs lacking TAP cannot cross-present exogenous viral antigens on MHC class I and thus cannot activate naive `$CD8^{+}$ T cells.\n- E is incorrect because TAP does not control DC migration to lymph nodes.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and direct explanation is that TAP-deficient DCs cannot cross-present exogenous viral antigens on MHC class I to prime naive `$CD8^{+}$ T cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2222708"}, {"introduction": "Cross-presentation allows dendritic cells to route external antigens into their internal MHC class I pathway, a process that requires moving proteins across membranes. This problem [@problem_id:2222687] focuses on the \"cytosolic pathway\" of cross-presentation, a mechanism where viral proteins are transported out of the phagosome and into the cytosol. By analyzing the effect of a hypothetical drug that blocks the Sec61 translocon, you will dissect the specific molecular steps required for priming `$CD8^{+}$ T cells while distinguishing them from those needed to activate `$CD4^{+}$ helper T cells.", "problem": "A new immunomodulatory drug, `Reroutinib`, is being developed. Its sole mechanism of action is the high-affinity, non-competitive inhibition of the Sec61 protein translocon complex, effectively blocking the passage of polypeptides through its channel. This drug is tested in a clinical trial where subjects receive a new vaccine formulation. The vaccine consists of whole, chemically inactivated viral particles from the fictional `Parvus` virus. In healthy, untreated individuals, this vaccine is known to reliably induce robust, protective immune responses mediated by both virus-specific `$CD4^{+}$ helper T cells and `$CD8^{+}$ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).\n\nThe problem specifies that for the `Parvus` virus, the dominant pathway for generating the `$CD8^{+}$ T cell response from this inactivated vaccine involves the following steps within a dendritic cell:\n1. Phagocytosis of the viral particle into a phagosome.\n2. Recruitment of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)-associated machinery to the phagosome membrane.\n3. Retro-translocation of whole viral proteins from the phagosome lumen into the cytosol, a process mediated by the Sec61 complex.\n4. Subsequent processing and presentation of viral antigens via the canonical MHC class I pathway.\n\nGiven this specific mechanism, which of the following outcomes most accurately predicts the primary effect of `Reroutinib` administration on the immune response to the `Parvus` virus vaccine?\n\nA. The activation of virus-specific `$CD8^{+}$ T cells will be unaffected, but the activation of virus-specific `$CD4^{+}$ T cells will be completely blocked.\n\nB. The activation of both virus-specific `$CD4^{+}$ T cells and `$CD8^{+}$ T cells will be severely impaired.\n\nC. The activation of virus-specific `$CD8^{+}$ T cells will be severely impaired or abrogated, while the activation of virus-specific `$CD4^{+}$ T cells will be largely unaffected.\n\nD. The activation of virus-specific `$CD8^{+}$ T cells will be significantly enhanced due to an accumulation of viral proteins in the cytosol.\n\nE. The activation of virus-specific `$CD4^{+}$ T cells will be unaffected, and the `$CD8^{+}$ T cell response will be redirected to recognize a different set of viral protein epitopes.", "solution": "1. Identify the dominant pathway for `$CD8^{+}$ T cell priming from the inactivated Parvus virus vaccine as stated in the problem: phagocytosis of viral particles, recruitment of ER-associated machinery to the phagosome, Sec61-mediated retro-translocation of intact viral proteins from the phagosome lumen into the cytosol, followed by proteasomal processing and presentation via the canonical MHC class I pathway.\n2. State the specific molecular target and effect of Reroutinib: high-affinity, non-competitive inhibition of the Sec61 protein translocon complex, blocking polypeptide passage through the Sec61 channel.\n3. Deduce the immediate mechanistic consequence on the `$CD8^{+}$ pathway: inhibition of Sec61 blocks retro-translocation (step 3), preventing delivery of exogenous viral proteins from the phagosome into the cytosol. Without cytosolic access, proteasomal degradation and subsequent TAP-dependent peptide loading onto MHC class I are abrogated; thus, cross-presentation via the cytosolic pathway is severely impaired or eliminated. Therefore, virus-specific `$CD8^{+}$ T cell activation from this vaccine is expected to be severely impaired or abrogated.\n4. Analyze the `$CD4^{+}$ T cell pathway: exogenous antigens are processed in endo-lysosomal compartments and loaded onto MHC class II within the endosomal system. This MHC class II antigen presentation pathway does not require retro-translocation through Sec61 from the phagosome to the cytosol. Consequently, Reroutinib’s Sec61 blockade does not directly disrupt this exogenous processing route, so virus-specific `$CD4^{+}$ T cell activation should be largely unaffected.\n5. Evaluate alternatives:\n   - A is incorrect because `$CD8^{+}$ activation depends on Sec61-mediated cross-presentation in this scenario and will be impaired; `$CD4^{+}$ does not depend on Sec61-mediated retro-translocation.\n   - B is incorrect because `$CD4^{+}$ activation via MHC class II should remain largely intact.\n   - D is incorrect because Sec61 blockade prevents, rather than increases, cytosolic accumulation of antigens.\n   - E is incorrect because blocking the dominant Sec61-dependent pathway reduces `$CD8^{+}$ priming rather than redirecting it; while a vacuolar cross-presentation route may exist, the problem specifies the Sec61-dependent route as dominant, so the primary effect is quantitative impairment, not qualitative redirection.\n6. Conclude that the primary predicted effect is severe impairment or abrogation of `$CD8^{+}$ T cell activation with largely unaffected `$CD4^{+}$ T cell activation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2222687"}, {"introduction": "While understanding the pathways of cross-presentation is crucial, immunology also relies on quantitative experiments to measure and compare these biological functions.

By using data from a reporter T-cell line and a provided calibration curve, you will translate raw experimental measurements into a meaningful comparison of cellular activity, highlighting how theoretical concepts are tested and quantified at the bench.", "problem": "An immunology researcher is investigating the efficiency of cross-presentation by different subsets of dendritic cells (DCs). Bone marrow progenitor cells are cultured under two distinct conditions to generate two populations of Bone Marrow-Derived DCs (BMDCs). Population A is generated using Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF), while Population B is generated using Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L).\n\nTo assay cross-presentation, a fixed number of DCs from each population ($1 \\times 10^5$ cells) is incubated with an excess of latex beads coated with the protein ovalbumin (OVA). During this incubation, the DCs phagocytose the beads and process the exogenous OVA, presenting a specific peptide fragment, SIINFEKL, on their Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules.\n\nFollowing the antigen processing period, a fixed number of B3Z cells ($2 \\times 10^5$ cells) are added to each well. The B3Z cell line is a T-cell hybridoma whose T-Cell Receptor (TCR) specifically recognizes the SIINFEKL peptide bound to the $H-2K^b$ MHC class I molecule. Engagement of the B3Z TCR triggers the expression of a lacZ reporter gene, leading to the production of the enzyme β-galactosidase. The activity of this enzyme is then quantified by adding a chromogenic substrate, which results in a color change measured as absorbance. The experiment is conducted in identical volumes and for identical incubation times for both DC populations. The final absorbance readings are $0.543$ for Population A (GM-CSF derived) and $0.918$ for Population B (Flt3L derived).\n\nA separate calibration experiment using synthetic SIINFEKL peptide provides a standard curve relating peptide concentration to T-cell activation. In this calibration, the relationship between the known concentration of synthetic SIINFEKL peptide, $C$ (in units of picomolar, pM), and the measured absorbance, $A$, is found to be linear according to the equation:\n$$A = (1.85 \\times 10^{-2}) \\times C + 0.065$$\nThis absorbance reflects the response of the same number of B3Z cells as used in the main experiment.\n\nAssuming that the cross-presentation efficiency is directly proportional to the effective concentration of SIINFEKL peptide presented on the DC surface, calculate the ratio of the cross-presentation efficiency of the Flt3L-derived DCs (Population B) to that of the GM-CSF-derived DCs (Population A).
