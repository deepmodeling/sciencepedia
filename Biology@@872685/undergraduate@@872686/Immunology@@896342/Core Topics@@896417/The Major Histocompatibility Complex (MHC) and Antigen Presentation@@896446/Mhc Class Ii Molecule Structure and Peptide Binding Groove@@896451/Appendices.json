These molecules are categorized into two main classes, Class I and Class II, which possess distinct structures and functions. An immunology student is tasked with identifying the correct structural model for a functional MHC class II molecule as it would be found on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate structural description of an MHC class II molecule?\n\nA. The molecule consists of two non-covalently associated polypeptide chains: a larger alpha (α) chain and a smaller beta (β) chain. Both chains are transmembrane proteins. The peptide-binding groove is formed by the interaction of the outermost domains of both chains, specifically the α1 and β1 domains.\n\nB. The molecule consists of a single, large, transmembrane alpha (α) chain that is non-covalently associated with a small, non-transmembrane protein called beta-2 microglobulin (β2m). The peptide-binding groove is formed entirely by domains of the alpha chain, specifically the α1 and α2 domains.\n\nC. The molecule is a heterodimer composed of an alpha (α) chain and a beta (β) chain. Only the alpha chain possesses a transmembrane region that anchors the complex to the cell membrane, while the beta chain is entirely extracellular and disulfide-bonded to the alpha chain.\n\nD.

Antigen-binding sites are formed at the N-terminal ends by the combination of one heavy chain and one light chain.", "solution": "We identify the essential structural features of MHC class II molecules from immunology principles:\n- An MHC class II molecule is a heterodimer composed of two non-covalently associated polypeptide chains, denoted $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n- Both the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ chains are transmembrane glycoproteins, each with two extracellular domains (for $\\alpha$: $\\alpha_{1}$ and $\\alpha_{2}$; for $\\beta$: $\\beta_{1}$ and $\\beta_{2}$), a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic tail.\n- The peptide-binding groove of MHC class II is formed by the pairing of the N-terminal domains $\\alpha_{1}$ and $\\beta_{1}$ and is typically open at both ends, accommodating longer peptides.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n- Option A states there are two non-covalently associated chains, a larger $\\alpha$ and a smaller $\\beta$, both transmembrane, and that the peptide-binding groove is formed by $\\alpha_{1}$ and $\\beta_{1}$.

This specificity arises from the chemical nature of amino acid \"pockets\" that interact with peptide \"anchor residues.\" This problem [@problem_id:2249292] provides a hands-on scenario to predict binding affinity based on fundamental principles of electrostatic interactions, demonstrating how allelic variation in MHC molecules creates a diverse immune repertoire.", "problem": "In human immunology, the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules are critical for initiating adaptive immune responses. They are expressed on antigen-presenting cells and display peptides, typically 13-25 amino acids long, to $CD4^+$ T-helper cells. The specificity of this interaction is largely determined by the binding of peptide \"anchor residues\" into specific pockets within the peptide-binding groove of the MHC molecule. The amino acid composition of these pockets varies between different MHC alleles, leading to different peptide-binding repertoires.\n\nConsider a hypothetical 13-mer peptide, referred to as Peptide-Z, with the sequence G-L-Y-A-I-S-F-V-**D**-K-T-V-M. The residue at position 9 (P9), which is Aspartate (D), serves as the primary C-terminal anchor residue for this peptide.\n\nNow, consider two different human MHC class II alleles:\n1.  **Allele-DR4X**: A variant of the HLA-DRB1 locus. A key residue contributing to the formation of its P9 pocket is Glutamate (E) at position 86 of the beta chain.\n2.  **Allele-DP2Y**: A variant of the HLA-DPB1 locus. A key residue contributing to the formation of its P9 pocket is Lysine (K) at position 85 of the beta chain.\n\nAssuming physiological pH (approximately 7.4), predict the binding interaction of Peptide-Z with these two MHC alleles. Based on the principles of protein-ligand interactions, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and mechanistically sound prediction?\n\nA. Peptide-Z will bind with high affinity to Allele-DR4X due to a favorable salt bridge formation, but will be repelled by Allele-DP2Y due to electrostatic repulsion in the P9 pocket.\nB. The size of the Aspartate side chain is the primary determinant of binding, not its charge. Therefore, Peptide-Z will bind with similar affinity to both alleles, provided the P9 pockets are large enough to accommodate it.\nC. Peptide-Z will bind with high affinity to Allele-DP2Y due to favorable electrostatic attraction, but will be repelled by Allele-DR4X due to electrostatic repulsion in the P9 pocket.\nD. The binding affinity is determined by the overall net charge of the entire peptide and the entire MHC molecule. Since this information is not provided, no reasonable prediction can be made about the specific P9 interaction.\nE. Peptide-Z will bind poorly to both alleles because interactions between charged residues, whether attractive or repulsive, are inherently destabilizing compared to hydrophobic interactions which typically dominate MHC-peptide binding.", "solution": "We proceed by applying acid-base ionization principles and electrostatic interaction rules to the specific residues that define the P9 pocket interaction, as specified.\n\nFirst, determine the ionization states at physiological pH. For an acidic side chain with acid dissociation constant $K_{a}$ and $pK_{a}=\\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{K_{a}}\\right)$, the Henderson–Hasselbalch relationship implies that when $\\mathrm{pH}>pK_{a}$ the acid is deprotonated and carries a negative charge, whereas for a basic side chain when $\\mathrm{pH}<pK_{a}$ the base is protonated and carries a positive charge. At physiological pH (approximately $7.4$ as given, but no numerical substitution is needed), the side chains behave as follows:\n- Aspartate (D) at P9 is an acidic residue; it is deprotonated and thus carries charge $q_{\\mathrm{Asp}}=-1$.\n- Glutamate (E) in the P9 pocket of Allele-DR4X is also acidic; it is deprotonated and carries charge $q_{\\mathrm{Glu}}=-1$.\n- Lysine (K) in the P9 pocket of Allele-DP2Y is basic; it is protonated and carries charge $q_{\\mathrm{Lys}}=+1$.\n\nSecond, evaluate the electrostatic interaction sign using Coulombic considerations. The electrostatic interaction energy between two point charges is\n$$\nU \\propto \\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{\\epsilon r},\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the effective dielectric constant and $r$ is the separation. The sign of $U$ is set by $q_{1}q_{2}$: if $q_{1}q_{2}<0$ the interaction is attractive (stabilizing), and if $q_{1}q_{2}>0$ the interaction is repulsive (destabilizing).\n\nApply this to the P9 interaction:\n- For Peptide-Z P9 Aspartate with Allele-DR4X P9 Glutamate: $q_{\\mathrm{Asp}}q_{\\mathrm{Glu}}=(-1)\\times(-1)=+1$, which predicts electrostatic repulsion and thus unfavorable binding at the P9 anchor pocket.\n- For Peptide-Z P9 Aspartate with Allele-DP2Y P9 Lysine: $q_{\\mathrm{Asp}}q_{\\mathrm{Lys}}=(-1)\\times(+1)=-1$, which predicts electrostatic attraction, a favorable salt bridge, and thus stabilizing binding at the P9 anchor pocket.\n\nThird, consider mechanistic implications:\n- Salt bridge formation between opposite charges in a binding pocket is a well-established stabilizing interaction and often contributes significantly to specificity in MHC-peptide binding. Therefore, an Aspartate at P9 would be favored by a Lysine-containing P9 pocket but disfavored by a Glutamate-containing P9 pocket.\n- Option B is inconsistent with established MHC pocket chemistry because charge complementarity at anchor positions is a primary determinant of specificity; side-chain size alone is insufficient to predict binding when charge-based attraction or repulsion is strong.\n- Option D is incorrect because the interaction at the P9 anchor is local and specifically sensitive to the charge complementarity between the anchor residue and the pocket residue; the overall net charges of the peptide and MHC are not required to make a prediction about the P9 interaction.\n- Option E is incorrect because attractive charged interactions (salt bridges) are not inherently destabilizing; they are commonly stabilizing in protein-ligand interfaces, including MHC-peptide pockets.\n\nHence, the mechanistically sound prediction is that Peptide-Z will bind with high affinity to Allele-DP2Y via favorable electrostatic attraction (salt bridge) and will be disfavored by Allele-DR4X due to electrostatic repulsion at the P9 pocket.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2249292"}, {"introduction": "Finally, we place the MHC class II-peptide complex into its physiological context—the immunological synapse. Successful T-cell activation depends not only on T-cell Receptor (TCR) recognition of the peptide but also on stabilizing interactions with co-receptors like CD4. This exercise [@problem_id:2249283] presents a thought experiment involving a targeted mutation, challenging you to predict the functional consequences of disrupting the MHC-CD4 interaction and highlighting the cooperative nature of immune recognition.", "problem": "The activation of a naive helper T-cell by an Antigen Presenting Cell (APC) is a finely tuned process. It fundamentally requires the T-cell Receptor (TCR) to recognize a specific peptide antigen bound to a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecule on the APC's surface. In humans, these MHC molecules are known as Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA). This primary recognition event is stabilized by the interaction of the CD4 co-receptor on the T-cell with a non-polymorphic region of the MHC class II molecule. Specifically, transmembrane protein CD4 binds to the β2 domain of the HLA-DR molecule, a common type of human MHC class II. This co-receptor binding is critical for sustaining the T-cell-APC interaction and for recruiting intracellular signaling molecules, such as the kinase Lck, to the TCR complex.\n\nConsider a biomedical research scenario where a cell line of APCs is genetically engineered to express a mutated form of the HLA-DR molecule. This mutation is a single amino acid substitution located in an exposed loop of the β2 domain. Biochemical assays demonstrate two key properties of this mutated HLA-DR:\n1. It binds and presents its target peptide antigen with the same affinity and conformation as the wild-type HLA-DR molecule.\n2. The mutation completely prevents the binding of the CD4 co-receptor, while not affecting any other part of the molecule's structure.\n\nThese engineered APCs, loaded with a high concentration of the specific peptide, are co-cultured with a population of naive helper T-cells whose TCRs are specific for this peptide-HLA-DR complex. Assume that all other conditions are optimal for T-cell activation, including the normal expression and function of co-stimulatory signal molecules (e.g., B7 on the APC and CD28 on the T-cell).\n\nWhich of the following choices most accurately predicts the functional consequence for T-cell activation in this experimental system?\n\nA. T-cell activation will proceed with normal kinetics and magnitude, as the primary recognition of the peptide by the TCR is unaffected.\nB. T-cells will fail to be activated and will enter a state of anergy, as the lack of CD4 engagement is functionally equivalent to receiving Signal 1 without Signal 2.\nC. T-cell activation will be significantly attenuated, requiring a much higher antigen dose or a TCR with intrinsically higher affinity to achieve a response comparable to that seen with wild-type HLA-DR.\nD. The T-cells will immediately undergo activation-induced cell death (apoptosis) due to the incomplete and anomalous signaling from the TCR complex.\nE. The interaction will be completely non-productive, with the T-cells failing to recognize or bind to the APCs in any measurable way.", "solution": "T-cell activation of naive $CD4^+$ T cells requires at minimum Signal 1 (TCR engagement of peptide–MHC class II) and Signal 2 (costimulation, e.g., CD28 binding B7). The CD4 co-receptor is not a separate “signal,” but it is essential for efficient Signal 1 by stabilizing TCR–MHC class II interactions and, critically, by recruiting the Src-family kinase Lck to the TCR–CD3 complex to phosphorylate ITAMs and initiate robust downstream signaling.\n\nGiven the engineered HLA-DR:\n- The peptide–MHC class II complex is presented normally, so TCR recognition (Signal 1 ligand) is intact.\n- CD4 binding to the HLA-DR beta2 domain is abolished, specifically removing CD4-mediated stabilization and Lck recruitment.\n- Costimulation via B7–CD28 (Signal 2) is intact and normal.\n\nLogical consequences:\n1. TCR–pMHC binding still occurs because the mutation does not alter the peptide-binding groove or TCR contact residues, so recognition is not abolished.\n2. Loss of CD4 binding diminishes the effective avidity of the T cell–APC interaction and markedly reduces proximal TCR signaling due to impaired Lck delivery to CD3 ITAMs. This raises the activation threshold.\n3. Because Signal 2 is present, the scenario is not equivalent to “Signal 1 without Signal 2,” so classic anergy induction is not expected from missing costimulation.\n4. Naive $CD4^+$ T cells are especially dependent on CD4-mediated signal amplification; therefore, activation will be weaker and require higher antigen density or higher intrinsic TCR affinity to reach the activation threshold comparable to wild-type HLA-DR conditions.\n5. Immediate activation-induced cell death is unlikely, as AICD typically follows repeated or strong activation, not attenuated signaling.\n6. Non-recognition is incorrect because TCR–pMHC recognition persists.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that activation is significantly attenuated and requires higher antigen dose or higher TCR affinity to achieve a response comparable to wild-type HLA-DR, matching option C. Options A, B, D, and E are inconsistent with the outlined signaling biology: A ignores the essential amplification role of CD4; B misattributes the effect to absent costimulation; D predicts apoptosis despite reduced signaling; E contradicts preserved TCR recognition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2249283"}]}
