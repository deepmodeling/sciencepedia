This typing relies on the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system, a group of genes located on chromosome 6. For simplicity in this problem, we will consider three key gene loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR. The specific versions, or alleles, of these genes are inherited from parents to children in blocks known as haplotypes. A haplotype is the set of alleles present on a single chromosome.\n\nA couple is undergoing genetic counseling to understand the potential HLA profiles of their future children. The genetic analysis reveals the paternal and maternal haplotypes as follows:\n\nThe father possesses two distinct haplotypes, one inherited from each of his parents:\n- Haplotype 1F: (HLA-A1, HLA-B8, HLA-DR3)\n- Haplotype 2F: (HLA-A2, HLA-B7, HLA-DR4)\n\nThe mother also possesses two distinct haplotypes:\n- Haplotype 1M: (HLA-A3, HLA-B5, HLA-DR1)\n- Haplotype 2M: (HLA-A9, HLA-B12, HLA-DR2)\n\nAssuming the genes for HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR are so tightly linked that meiotic recombination between them is negligible, which of the following represent all possible HLA genotypes for a child of this couple?
