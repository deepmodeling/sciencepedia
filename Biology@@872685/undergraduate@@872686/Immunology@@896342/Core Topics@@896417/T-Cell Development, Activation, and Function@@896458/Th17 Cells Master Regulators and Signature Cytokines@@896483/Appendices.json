Using hypothetical data from a Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiment, you will learn how to quantify the concept of cooperative binding, providing a mathematical basis for understanding how these proteins collaborate to orchestrate the Th17 program [@problem_id:2272874].", "problem": "T helper 17 (Th17) cells are a subset of T lymphocytes crucial for host defense against extracellular pathogens but are also implicated in the pathology of autoimmune diseases. Their function is mediated by signature cytokines, primarily Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and Interleukin-17F (IL-17F), whose genes are co-located in the *Il17a/Il17f* locus. The differentiation of Th17 cells and expression of these cytokines are orchestrated by a network of transcription factors, with Retinoid-related Orphan Receptor gamma t (RORγt) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) being the master regulators.\n\nTo investigate the interplay between these two factors, a researcher performs a Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiment. This technique quantifies the binding of a specific protein to DNA across the genome. The resulting data is expressed as a normalized, dimensionless \"binding signal\" ($S$). The experiment focuses on a key regulatory element within the *Il17a/Il17f* locus known as Conserved Non-coding Sequence 2 (CNS2).\n\nThe binding signals for STAT3 and RORγt at the CNS2 region were measured in differentiating Th17 cells under three genetic conditions: wild-type (WT), RORγt-knockout (RORγt KO), and STAT3-knockout (STAT3 KO). The results are as follows:\n- The binding signal of STAT3 in WT cells is $S_{STAT3}^{WT} = 157.8$.\n- The binding signal of RORγt in WT cells is $S_{ROR\\gamma t}^{WT} = 124.5$.\n- The binding signal of STAT3 in RORγt KO cells is $S_{STAT3}^{ROR\\gamma t\\ KO} = 32.1$.\n- The binding signal of RORγt in STAT3 KO cells is $S_{ROR\\gamma t}^{STAT3\\ KO} = 25.6$.\n\nTo quantify the cooperative binding between the two transcription factors, a \"Symmetric Cooperativity Index\" (SCI) is proposed. It is calculated in two steps. First, the \"recruitment enhancement factor\" of a transcription factor A by a transcription factor B, denoted $E_{A \\leftarrow B}$, is defined as the ratio of factor A's binding signal in the presence of factor B (WT cells) to its signal in the absence of factor B (B-knockout cells). Second, the SCI is defined as the geometric mean of the two reciprocal recruitment enhancement factors, i.e., the enhancement of STAT3 by RORγt and the enhancement of RORγt by STAT3.\n\nBased on the provided data and definitions, calculate the Symmetric Cooperativity Index (SCI) for the interaction between RORγt and STAT3 at the CNS2 locus.

This practice problem places you in the role of a drug developer, tasked with evaluating potential therapeutic compounds based on potency and selectivity. By analyzing data from a Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) assay, you will apply rigorous, quantitative criteria to identify a promising drug candidate that selectively inhibits the pro-inflammatory IL-23 pathway, a key goal in treating autoimmune diseases [@problem_id:2272899].", "problem": "In the field of immunology, T helper 17 (Th17) cells are critical for host defense but are also implicated in the pathology of numerous autoimmune diseases. The differentiation and function of these cells are governed by specific signaling molecules called cytokines. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is important for the initial development of Th17 cells, while Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is crucial for their maintenance, expansion, and pathogenic activity. Both IL-6 and IL-23 exert their effects by activating a common intracellular protein: the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3). Upon cytokine receptor binding, STAT3 becomes phosphorylated (p-STAT3) and binds to the receptor's cytoplasmic tail, initiating a downstream signaling cascade.\n\nA new therapeutic strategy aims to selectively curb the pathogenic activity of Th17 cells by blocking the IL-23 signaling pathway without affecting the broader, often beneficial, roles of IL-6. To achieve this, a drug discovery program is screening synthetic peptide mimetics designed to competitively inhibit the binding of p-STAT3 to the IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) cytoplasmic tail.\n\nThe screening is performed using a Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) based competition assay. In this setup, a peptide fragment corresponding to a p-STAT3 binding site is immobilized on a sensor chip. A solution containing a fixed concentration of p-STAT3 is then flowed over the chip. The ability of a candidate peptide mimetic to disrupt this interaction is quantified by its half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), which is the concentration of the mimetic required to reduce the binding of p-STAT3 to the immobilized peptide by 50%. A lower IC50 value indicates a more potent inhibitor.\n\nTwo parallel assays are conducted for each candidate mimetic:\n1.  **IL-23 Pathway Assay**: A peptide fragment from the IL-23R tail (`Pep23`) is immobilized. The resulting IC50 is denoted as `IC50_23`.\n2.  **IL-6 Pathway Assay**: A peptide fragment from the IL-6 receptor complex subunit gp130 (`Pep6`) is immobilized.
