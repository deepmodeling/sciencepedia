By considering the effect of a specific inhibitor, you can deduce the indispensable role of the proteasome in generating the peptide signals necessary to sound the alarm against internal threats.", "problem": "A research team is investigating an experimental compound, \"Compound X,\" for its potential antiviral properties. They set up an in vitro experiment to assess its effect on the immune response to a viral infection. They use dendritic cells (DCs), a type of professional antigen-presenting cell, which they infect with a specific virus that replicates within the cytoplasm. These infected DCs are then co-cultured with naive CD8$^{+}$ T cells that are genetically engineered to recognize a specific peptide derived from a viral protein.\n\nThe experiment is conducted under two conditions:\n1.  Infected DCs co-cultured with the specific naive CD8$^{+}$ T cells.\n2.  Infected DCs co-cultured with the specific naive CD8$^{+}$ T cells in the presence of Compound X.\n\nSubsequent biochemical analysis reveals that Compound X is a highly specific and potent inhibitor of the proteasome, the cellular machinery responsible for degrading cytosolic proteins into smaller peptides. Based on this mechanism of action for Compound X, what would be the most likely outcome on T cell activation observed in the second condition compared to the first?\n\nA. Enhanced activation of naive CD8$^{+}$ T cells due to an accumulation of viral proteins in the DC.\n\nB. No significant change in the activation of naive CD8$^{+}$ T cells, as antigen presentation to CD8$^{+}$ T cells primarily relies on extracellular antigens.\n\nC. A significant reduction in the activation of naive CD8$^{+}$ T cells because the appropriate viral peptide cannot be generated for presentation.\n\nD. A significant reduction in the activation of naive CD8$^{+}$ T cells because the drug prevents viral entry into the DCs.\n\nE. A shift in T cell response, where the CD8$^{+}$ T cells now recognize the intact viral proteins on the DC surface.", "solution": "1) Identify the antigen processing pathway used: The virus replicates in the cytoplasm of dendritic cells, producing endogenous viral proteins. Endogenous antigens are processed for presentation to CD8-positive T cells via the major histocompatibility complex class I pathway. Canonically, this pathway proceeds as follows: cytosolic proteins are degraded into short peptides by the proteasome; these peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum by the transporter associated with antigen processing; peptides of suitable length and sequence bind to the peptide-binding groove of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules; peptide-major histocompatibility complex class I complexes traffic to the plasma membrane for recognition by CD8-positive T cells.\n\n2) Analyze the baseline (condition 1): Infected dendritic cells process cytosolic viral proteins via the proteasome, generate the specific viral peptide recognized by the engineered CD8-positive T cells, load this peptide onto major histocompatibility complex class I, and present it at the surface, resulting in activation of the naive CD8-positive T cells.\n\n3) Introduce the perturbation (condition 2): Compound X is a highly specific and potent proteasome inhibitor. Inhibition of the proteasome prevents proteolytic generation of the short peptides from cytosolic viral proteins that are required for loading onto major histocompatibility complex class I.\n\n4) Consequence for antigen presentation: With the proteasome inhibited, appropriate viral peptides are not produced in sufficient quantity or at all. Consequently, peptide transport by the transporter associated with antigen processing into the endoplasmic reticulum is reduced, peptide loading onto major histocompatibility complex class I is impaired, and the number of surface peptide-major histocompatibility complex class I complexes specific for the engineered T cell receptor decreases.\n\n5) Consequence for T cell activation: Reduced density of the cognate peptide-major histocompatibility complex class I complexes on dendritic cells diminishes T cell receptor engagement and co-stimulation efficacy for the specific naive CD8-positive T cells, producing a significant reduction in T cell activation compared to the first condition.\n\n6) Exclude incorrect alternatives: Accumulation of intact viral proteins (option A) does not enhance class I presentation because processing is blocked; antigen presentation to CD8-positive T cells does not primarily rely on extracellular antigens (option B), which are typically routed to major histocompatibility complex class II unless cross-presentation occurs, and in any case peptide generation for class I still requires proteasomal activity; proteasome inhibition does not prevent viral entry (option D); CD8-positive T cells recognize peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex class I, not intact proteins on the cell surface (option E).\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is a significant reduction in activation due to failure to generate the appropriate peptide for presentation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2263422"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to internal threats, professional APCs must also alert the immune system to dangers lurking outside the cell, such as extracellular bacteria. This practice problem [@problem_id:2263421] investigates the MHC class II pathway, which handles these exogenous antigens.

The ability of the macrophage to migrate towards chemical signals (chemotaxis) released at the site of infection.", "solution": "The $V$-type $H^{+}$-ATPase in lysosomal and phagolysosomal membranes actively transports $H^{+}$ into the lumen, establishing and maintaining a low intraluminal pH. A loss-of-function mutation in this pump prevents acidification of endosomes, lysosomes, and phagolysosomes.\n\nLow pH is essential for:\n- Activation and optimal function of acid-dependent hydrolases and proteases (e.g., cathepsins) that degrade internalized proteins.\n- Degradation of the invariant chain (Ii) to CLIP in the MHC class II pathway, a process mediated by acid-dependent proteases.\n- Efficient peptide loading onto MHC class II in the late endosome/MIIC compartment, facilitated by HLA-DM in an acidic environment.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and significant immunological impairment is in the MHC class II antigen processing and presentation pathway for exogenous (phagocytosed) antigens. Without acidification, phagocytosed bacterial proteins are poorly degraded into peptides, Ii is not properly removed, and peptide loading onto MHC class II is inefficient, resulting in diminished presentation to CD4-positive T cells.\n\nBy contrast:\n- Recognition and engulfment of bacteria (option A) occur via surface receptors and opsonins and precede acidification; this step is not directly dependent on lysosomal pH.\n- MHC class I presentation of cytosolic viral peptides (option B) uses the proteasome, TAP transport into the endoplasmic reticulum, and loading onto MHC class I independently of lysosomal acidification.\n- Cytokine synthesis and secretion (option D), such as TNF-alpha production after bacterial recognition, are primarily driven by receptor signaling and transcriptional pathways; while certain endosomal TLRs require acidification, the key responses to extracellular bacteria (e.g., via TLR2 and TLR4 at the plasma membrane) and the general cytokine production machinery are not directly dependent on lysosomal acidification.\n- Chemotaxis (option E) depends on cytoskeletal dynamics and chemokine receptor signaling, not on lysosomal pH.\n\nThus, the defect most directly compromises presentation of peptides from phagocytosed extracellular bacteria on MHC class II molecules.\n\nThe correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2263421"}, {"introduction": "Effective antigen presentation is necessary for T cell activation, but it is not sufficient. The immune system has a crucial safety check to prevent accidental self-reactivity, known as the \"two-signal model\". This problem [@problem_id:2263414] challenges you to predict the outcome when a T cell receives the specific antigen signal (Signal 1) without the essential \"danger\" signal (Signal 2) from the APC, illustrating a fundamental mechanism of peripheral tolerance known as anergy.", "problem": "The activation of a naive T lymphocyte is a critical event in initiating an adaptive immune response. This process is governed by a \"two-signal\" model. Signal 1 is provided by the T Cell Receptor (TCR) binding to a specific peptide antigen presented by a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecule on an Antigen Presenting Cell (APC). Signal 2 is a co-stimulatory signal, typically involving the interaction of the CD28 on the T cell with a B7 family molecule (such as CD80 or CD86) on the APC.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario involving a specialized professional APC, such as a dendritic cell. This APC successfully engulfs, processes, and presents an exogenous peptide antigen on its MHC Class II molecules, providing a perfect Signal 1 to a naive CD4$^{+}$ T cell that recognizes this specific peptide-MHC complex. However, due to a specific cellular defect, this APC completely fails to upregulate the expression of B7 molecules on its surface. What is the most likely fate of the naive T cell upon this interaction?\n\nA. The T cell will undergo robust clonal expansion and differentiate into an effector helper T cell.\n\nB. The T cell will immediately undergo apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death.\n\nC. The T cell will become anergic, entering a state of long-lived functional unresponsiveness.\n\nD. The T cell will differentiate into a memory T cell without first becoming an effector cell.\n\nE. The T cell will switch its specificity and recognize a different antigen.", "solution": "The activation of naive T cells is a tightly regulated process that prevents inappropriate immune responses, such as those directed against self-antigens. The \"two-signal hypothesis\" is central to understanding this regulation.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the signals delivered to the T cell.**\nThe problem states that the Antigen Presenting Cell (APC) successfully presents the antigen via its Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecule. A naive CD4$^{+}$ T cell with a corresponding T Cell Receptor (TCR) recognizes this complex. This interaction constitutes **Signal 1**. The problem also explicitly states that due to a defect, the APC fails to upregulate B7 molecules. B7 molecules (CD80/CD86) on the APC bind to the CD28 receptor on the T cell to provide **Signal 2**. Therefore, in this scenario, the T cell receives Signal 1 but does not receive Signal 2.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the two-signal model of T cell activation.**\nThe rules of the two-signal model are as follows:\n-   **Signal 1 + Signal 2:** Leads to full T cell activation, proliferation (clonal expansion), and differentiation into effector and memory cells.\n-   **Signal 1 alone (without Signal 2):** Does not lead to activation. Instead, it induces a state of tolerance known as clonal anergy.\n-   **Signal 2 alone (without Signal 1):** Has no effect on the T cell.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the outcome based on the delivered signals.**\nSince the T cell receives Signal 1 in the absence of Signal 2, it will not be activated. Instead, it will be driven into a state of **clonal anergy**. An anergic T cell is not deleted (it does not die via apoptosis immediately), but it becomes functionally unresponsive. If this anergic cell later encounters an APC providing both Signal 1 and Signal 2, it will still fail to mount an effective response. This mechanism is a crucial way the immune system maintains peripheral tolerance to self-antigens, as self-reactive T cells might encounter self-antigens on tissue cells that lack costimulatory B7 molecules.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options.**\n-   **A. The T cell will undergo robust clonal expansion and differentiate into an effector helper T cell.** This is incorrect. This outcome requires both Signal 1 and Signal 2.\n-   **B. The T cell will immediately undergo apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death.** While apoptosis is a mechanism of tolerance, anergy is the classic and primary outcome for a naive T cell receiving Signal 1 without Signal 2. Activation-induced cell death is a different process that typically occurs after a T cell has already been activated.\n-   **C. The T cell will become anergic, entering a state of long-lived functional unresponsiveness.** This is the correct outcome according to the two-signal model for T cell activation.\n-   **D. The T cell will differentiate into a memory T cell without first becoming an effector cell.** This is incorrect. Memory cell formation is a consequence of a successful primary activation (requiring both signals), where a subset of expanded effector cells differentiates into long-lived memory cells.\n-   **E. The T cell will switch its specificity and recognize a different antigen.** This is incorrect. The specificity of the TCR is fixed by V(D)J recombination during T cell development in the thymus and does not change upon antigen encounter in the periphery.\n\nTherefore, the interaction described induces a state of clonal anergy in the naive T cell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2263414"}]}
