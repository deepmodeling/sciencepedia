This exercise asks you to predict the fate of a mouse that cannot produce the CD28 protein, effectively removing the primary 'Signal 2' for its T cells. By considering this scenario [@problem_id:2274251], you can explore the non-negotiable role costimulation plays in mounting a successful adaptive immune response against a new pathogen.", "problem": "The activation of a naive T cell, a critical event for initiating an adaptive immune response, is governed by a \"two-signal\" model. The first signal is delivered when the T-cell Receptor (TCR) on the T-cell surface recognizes a specific peptide antigen presented by a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecule on an Antigen Presenting Cell (APC). However, this signal alone is insufficient for full activation. A second, costimulatory signal, delivered by the interaction of other pairs of molecules on the T cell and the APC, is also required.\n\nConsider a laboratory mouse that has been genetically engineered to be a \"knockout\" for the CD28 gene. This means the mouse is unable to produce the CD28 protein, which is normally expressed on the surface of its T cells and serves as a key costimulatory receptor. This mouse is then infected for the first time with a specific pathogenic virus that it has never encountered before.\n\nBased on your understanding of T-cell activation, which of the following outcomes is the most likely consequence for this mouse's ability to combat the primary viral infection?\n\nA. The mouse will mount a hyper-aggressive and uncontrolled T-cell response, leading to severe immunopathology.\n\nB. The mouse's T cells will fail to become properly activated, leading to a severely compromised adaptive immune response and an inability to clear the virus.\n\nC. The mouse's immune response will be completely normal, as other costimulatory pathways will fully compensate for the lack of CD28.\n\nD. The mouse will exhibit normal cytotoxic T-cell activity against infected cells, but will be unable to produce virus-specific antibodies.\n\nE. The mouse will successfully clear the initial viral infection but will be unable to form a long-lasting immunological memory.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the immunological outcome in a mouse lacking the CD28 protein when faced with a primary viral infection. This requires understanding the two-signal model of naive T-cell activation.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the role of CD28 in T-cell activation.**\nNaive T-cell activation is the process by which a T cell that has not previously encountered its specific antigen is triggered to proliferate and differentiate into an effector cell. This process requires two distinct signals delivered by an Antigen Presenting Cell (APC), such as a dendritic cell that has captured viral antigens.\n*   **Signal 1 (Antigen-specific signal):** This is provided by the binding of the T-cell Receptor (TCR) and its co-receptor (CD4 or CD8) to the peptide-MHC complex on the APC surface. This signal confers specificity to the response.\n*   **Signal 2 (Costimulatory signal):** This is an antigen-independent signal required for full activation. The most critical and well-studied costimulatory interaction for naive T cells is the binding of the CD28 protein on the T cell to B7 proteins (B7-1/CD80 and B7-2/CD86) on the APC. APCs upregulate B7 proteins only when they detect signs of infection or inflammation (e.g., through pattern recognition receptors).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the consequence of receiving Signal 1 without Signal 2.**\nA central tenet of immunology is that if a naive T cell receives Signal 1 (TCR engagement) in the absence of Signal 2 (costimulation), it does not become an activated effector cell. Instead, it enters a state of long-lived functional unresponsiveness known as **anergy**. An anergic T cell cannot be properly activated even if it later encounters an APC providing both signals. In some cases, receiving Signal 1 without Signal 2 can also lead to apoptosis (programmed cell death) of the T cell. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining peripheral tolerance and preventing autoimmunity, as it ensures T cells are only activated in the context of a genuine infection signaled by the APC.\n\n**Step 3: Apply this knowledge to the CD28 knockout mouse.**\nThe mouse in the problem is a CD28 knockout, meaning its T cells lack the CD28 protein. When this mouse is infected with a virus, its APCs will process viral antigens and present them on MHC molecules. Naive T cells specific to these viral antigens will recognize them and receive Signal 1. However, because the T cells lack CD28, they cannot engage with the B7 proteins on the APCs. Therefore, they will not receive the essential Signal 2.\n\nConsequently, the virus-specific T cells in this mouse will become anergic or die. They will fail to proliferate and differentiate into effector helper T cells (which are needed to help B cells and cytotoxic T cells) and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (which are needed to kill virus-infected cells). The result is a failure to mount an effective adaptive immune response.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options.**\n*   **A. The mouse will mount a hyper-aggressive and uncontrolled T-cell response...** This is incorrect. CD28 is a positive, activating signal. Its absence would lead to a lack of response, not a hyper-response. A hyper-response might be seen if a negative regulator (like CTLA-4 or PD-1) were knocked out.\n*   **B. The mouse's T cells will fail to become properly activated...** This is correct. The lack of Signal 2 (via CD28) prevents T-cell activation and leads to anergy, crippling the adaptive immune response and making it impossible to clear the virus.\n*   **C. The mouse's immune response will be completely normal...** This is incorrect. While some other costimulatory molecules exist, the CD28-B7 pathway is non-redundant and essential for the activation of naive T cells. Other pathways cannot fully compensate for its absence in a primary response.\n*   **D. The mouse will exhibit normal cytotoxic T-cell activity, but will be unable to produce virus-specific antibodies.** This is incorrect. The activation of both cytotoxic T cells and the helper T cells required for antibody production is dependent on the initial activation step that requires CD28. Therefore, both arms of the T-cell response will be deficient.\n*   **E. The mouse will successfully clear the initial viral infection but will be unable to form a long-lasting immunological memory.** This is incorrect. The defect occurs at the very beginning of the adaptive response—the initial activation. The mouse will not be able to effectively clear the virus in the first place, so the question of memory formation is secondary and also would not occur properly.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is a severe failure of the adaptive immune response.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2274251"}, {"introduction": "While the first practice established the necessity of costimulation, this next scenario explores why this powerful signal must be strictly regulated. We will consider a hypothetical individual whose antigen-presenting cells express B7 costimulatory molecules at all times, even without an infection. This exercise [@problem_id:2274256] challenges you to think about the role of the CD28-B7 pathway in maintaining self-tolerance and the devastating consequences that arise when this control is lost.", "problem": "The activation of a naive T-lymphocyte into an effector cell is a critical event in initiating an adaptive immune response. This process is governed by the \"two-signal hypothesis\". Signal 1 is provided when the T-cell receptor (TCR) specifically recognizes a peptide antigen presented by a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecule on the surface of an Antigen-Presenting Cell (APC). Signal 1 alone is insufficient for activation and, in the absence of a second signal, leads to a state of T cell unresponsiveness known as anergy. Full T-cell activation requires a concurrent Signal 2, known as costimulation. A primary costimulatory pathway involves the CD28 receptor on the T cell binding to B7 proteins (such as B7-1/CD80 and B7-2/CD86) on the APC. In a healthy individual, B7 proteins are only significantly expressed on APCs that have been activated by detecting danger signals, such as those associated with an infection. This mechanism ensures that T cells are activated only against legitimate threats and helps maintain self-tolerance.\n\nConsider a hypothetical individual with a rare genetic mutation. This mutation affects the regulatory genes controlling B7 protein expression in all of their APCs (e.g., dendritic cells, macrophages). As a result, these APCs constitutively express high levels of B7 proteins on their surface at all times, even in the complete absence of infection or inflammation.\n\nWhich of the following describes the most likely immunological consequence for this individual?\n\nA. Widespread autoimmune reactions against self-tissues.\n\nB. A state of immunodeficiency characterized by a failure to respond to foreign pathogens.\n\nC. A selective inability of B-cells to undergo class switching, leading to the production of only IgM antibodies.\n\nD. Failure of T-cell positive and negative selection in the thymus.\n\nE. A significant increase in the number of anergic, unresponsive T cells in circulation.", "solution": "The two-signal hypothesis requires that naive T cells receive both Signal 1 (TCR recognition of peptide–MHC on an APC) and Signal 2 (costimulation, classically CD28 on T cells binding B7-1/B7-2 on APCs) for full activation. In the absence of costimulation, Signal 1 alone drives tolerance mechanisms such as anergy.\n\nIn healthy individuals, peripheral tolerance is maintained in part because resting APCs presenting self-peptides do not express significant levels of B7. Therefore, self-reactive naive T cells encountering self–peptide–MHC typically receive Signal 1 without Signal 2 and become anergic or are deleted. Costimulatory B7 expression is normally upregulated only when APCs detect danger signals, restricting T-cell activation to contexts of infection or inflammation.\n\nIn the described mutation, APCs constitutively express high levels of B7 irrespective of danger signals. Consequently, when naive T cells encounter self–peptide–MHC complexes on these APCs, they will receive both Signal 1 and Signal 2. This converts what would ordinarily induce anergy into full activation, leading to the proliferation and differentiation of self-reactive T cells. The net effect is a breakdown of peripheral tolerance with inappropriate activation of autoreactive T cells and resultant autoimmunity.\n\nThis scenario does not predict immunodeficiency (opposite of B), a selective defect in B-cell class switching (C), or a failure of thymic selection (D), which are governed by different mechanisms. Constitutive costimulation prevents anergy rather than increasing the number of anergic T cells, making E incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2274256"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the qualitative 'on/off' rules of T-cell activation, we now transition to a more quantitative perspective.
