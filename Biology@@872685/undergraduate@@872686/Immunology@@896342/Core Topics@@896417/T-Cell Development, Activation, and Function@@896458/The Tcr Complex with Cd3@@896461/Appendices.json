This practice focuses on the CD3$\\zeta$ (zeta) homodimer, the primary signaling powerhouse of the TCR complex, due to its high density of Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs (ITAMs). By performing a straightforward calculation [@problem_id:2279866], you will quantify the total number of phosphorylatable tyrosine residues, providing a concrete measure of the complex's signaling potential.", "problem": "The T-Cell Receptor (TCR) complex is a multi-protein assembly on the surface of T-lymphocytes responsible for recognizing antigens. Signal transduction following antigen recognition is initiated by accessory molecules, collectively known as CD3. A critical part of these accessory molecules is a signaling motif called the Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motif (ITAM).\n\nThe canonical structure of a single ITAM contains exactly two tyrosine (Y) residues that can be phosphorylated by kinases, which is essential for initiating downstream signaling cascades.\n\nThe CD3 complex includes several distinct polypeptide chains. One of the most important for signaling is the CD3 zeta (CD3ζ) chain. In a typical TCR complex, the CD3ζ component is a homodimer, meaning it is composed of two identical CD3ζ chains associated with each other. Each individual CD3ζ polypeptide chain contains exactly three ITAMs in its cytoplasmic domain.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the total number of phosphorylatable tyrosine residues located within all the ITAMs of a single CD3ζ homodimer.", "solution": "An ITAM contains exactly two phosphorylatable tyrosine residues. Let the number of tyrosines per ITAM be $t=2$.\n\nEach CD3$\\zeta$ polypeptide chain contains exactly three ITAMs. Let the number of ITAMs per chain be $i=3$.\n\nThe CD3$\\zeta$ component is a homodimer, so there are two identical chains. Let the number of chains be $c=2$.\n\nThe total number of ITAMs in the homodimer is\n$$\nI_{\\text{total}}=c \\times i=2 \\times 3=6.\n$$\nEach ITAM has $t=2$ tyrosines, so the total number of phosphorylatable tyrosine residues is\n$$\nY_{\\text{total}}=I_{\\text{total}} \\times t=(2 \\times 3) \\times 2=12.\n$$\nTherefore, the CD3$\\zeta$ homodimer contains $12$ phosphorylatable tyrosine residues within all of its ITAMs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "2279866"}, {"introduction": "Signal initiation is not just about the presence of phosphorylation sites; it depends on their precise arrangement and the ability of downstream molecules to recognize them. This problem [@problem_id:2279882] presents a thought experiment involving a specific mutation within the ITAMs of the CD3$\\zeta$ chain. Analyzing this scenario will allow you to explore the critical role of dual tyrosine phosphorylation in creating a high-affinity docking site for the ZAP-70 kinase, a pivotal event for propagating the activation signal.", "problem": "T-cell activation is a critical event in the adaptive immune response, initiated by the T-cell Receptor (TCR) recognizing a specific peptide antigen presented by a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecule on an antigen-presenting cell. The TCR itself has no intrinsic signaling capacity. Instead, it is non-covalently associated with the CD3 complex, which includes the CD3ζ (zeta) homodimer. Each CD3ζ chain contains three intracellular Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs (ITAMs).\n\nThe canonical signaling pathway begins when TCR engagement leads to the activation of the Src-family kinase Lck. Lck then phosphorylates both tyrosine residues within the consensus sequence of the ITAMs (YxxL/I-x$_{6-8}$-YxxL/I). This dual phosphorylation creates a high-affinity docking site for the tandem SH2 domains of a cytosolic kinase, the Zeta-associated protein of 70 kDa (ZAP-70). Upon recruitment to the plasma membrane, ZAP-70 is itself phosphorylated and activated by Lck. Activated ZAP-70 then phosphorylates key downstream adaptor proteins, such as the Linker for Activation of T cells (LAT), propagating the signal.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered T-cell line in which the endogenous CD3ζ gene has been replaced with a mutant version. In this mutant protein, the C-terminal tyrosine residue within every ITAM has been substituted with a phenylalanine (F). Phenylalanine is structurally similar to tyrosine but lacks the hydroxyl group necessary for phosphorylation. All other cellular components are wild-type.\n\nThese mutant T cells are stimulated with their cognate peptide-MHC complex. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the state of the proximal T-cell signaling machinery immediately following this stimulation?\n\nA. Lck fails to become catalytically active, preventing any phosphorylation of the CD3ζ chains.\n\nB. The N-terminal tyrosines of the CD3ζ ITAMs become phosphorylated, but ZAP-70 is not efficiently recruited to the TCR complex, leading to a failure in LAT phosphorylation.\n\nC. ZAP-70 binds to the singly-phosphorylated ITAMs with normal affinity but cannot be activated by Lck because the second tyrosine site is absent.\n\nD. The TCR/CD3 complex is recognized as faulty and is rapidly degraded, preventing any possibility of signal initiation.\n\nE. ZAP-70 fails to bind, but the related kinase Syk, normally found in B cells, is recruited as a compensatory mechanism, leading to a modified but functional signal.", "solution": "TCR engagement with peptide-MHC initiates proximal signaling by activating the Src-family kinase Lck via co-receptor interactions. This step does not require intact, doubly phosphorylatable ITAMs on CD3ζ; thus, Lck becomes catalytically active upon stimulation in both wild-type and mutant cells.\n\nIn the wild-type case, active Lck phosphorylates both tyrosines within each ITAM consensus sequence $YxxL/I-x_{6-8}-YxxL/I$, producing doubly phosphorylated ITAMs that create a high-affinity docking site for the tandem SH2 domains of ZAP-70. Stable membrane recruitment of ZAP-70 via both SH2 domains is required for efficient subsequent phosphorylation and activation of ZAP-70 by Lck, and for phosphorylation of LAT downstream.\n\nIn the engineered mutant, the C-terminal tyrosine in every ITAM is replaced by phenylalanine, which cannot be phosphorylated. Consequently:\n- Lck activation still occurs upon TCR engagement because it is upstream of ITAM phosphorylation.\n- Lck can phosphorylate only the remaining N-terminal tyrosine in each ITAM; the C-terminal site is absent, so no ITAM can become doubly phosphorylated.\n- ZAP-70’s tandem SH2 domains require two phosphotyrosines in the correct spacing/orientation for high-affinity binding; with only a single phosphotyrosine per ITAM, binding is weak and not efficiently sustained.\n- Without efficient recruitment, ZAP-70 is not effectively activated by Lck at the TCR complex, and LAT is not phosphorylated.\n\nTherefore, the immediate proximal signaling state is that the N-terminal tyrosines are phosphorylated by Lck, but ZAP-70 is not efficiently recruited, leading to failure in LAT phosphorylation. This corresponds to option B. Options A and D are incorrect because Lck activation and complex stability do not depend on intact C-terminal ITAM tyrosines in this immediate timeframe. Option C is incorrect because ZAP-70 does not bind singly phosphorylated ITAMs with normal affinity, and the absence of the second ITAM tyrosine does not prevent Lck from catalyzing ZAP-70 phosphorylation per se; it prevents ZAP-70 recruitment. Option E is not accurate for T cells under these conditions; compensatory Syk recruitment is not a typical immediate mechanism here.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2279882"}, {"introduction": "Immunological concepts are often visualized as diagrams, but how can we experimentally verify the molecular motions they imply? This exercise introduces you to Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), a powerful biophysical technique that acts as a 'molecular ruler' to measure distances between proteins inside a living cell.
