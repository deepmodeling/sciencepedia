Before any wet-lab experiments are run, bioinformatic tools can screen the entire protein makeup (the proteome) of a pathogen for short sequences that resemble known human autoantigens. This exercise [@problem_id:2250519] simulates this crucial first step, challenging you to use a simplified scoring system to quantify the similarity between a human self-peptide and several bacterial candidates. By calculating a \"bio-similarity score,\" you will practice the logic used to identify the most likely microbial trigger for an autoimmune response.", "problem": "Immunologists are investigating a potential case of molecular mimicry, where an infection with a pathogenic bacterium is suspected of triggering an autoimmune response in a patient. A key human autoantigenic epitope, the part of the self-protein recognized by the immune system, has been identified as the 7-amino-acid peptide with the sequence $\\text{S-K-V-F-L-D-A}$. The letters represent single-letter codes for amino acids.\n\nTo identify a potential triggering peptide from the bacterium, researchers have searched its proteome and found four candidate peptides of the same length. Your task is to determine which of these bacterial peptides is the most likely culprit by calculating a \"bio-similarity score\" between the human epitope and each bacterial candidate. The peptide with the highest score is considered the most probable cause of the molecular mimicry.\n\nThe bio-similarity score is calculated by summing the scores for each amino acid pair at each position (1 through 7) based on the following rules and amino acid groupings:\n\n**Scoring Rules:**\n*   **Identity Match:** An identical amino acid at the same position (e.g., S vs. S) scores +5 points.\n*   **Conservative Substitution:** A non-identical amino acid from the same functional group scores +3 points.\n*   **Semi-Conservative Substitution:** A substitution between an amino acid from the 'Aliphatic' group and one from the 'Aromatic' group scores +1 point.\n*   **Non-Conservative Substitution:** Any other mismatch scores -10 points.\n\n**Amino Acid Functional Groups:**\n*   **Group 1 (Aliphatic):** G, A, V, L, I, P\n*   **Group 2 (Aromatic):** F, Y, W\n*   **Group 3 (Polar, uncharged):** S, T, C, M, N, Q\n*   **Group 4 (Acidic):** D, E\n*   **Group 5 (Basic):** K, R, H\n\n**Candidate Bacterial Peptides:**\n\nA. $\\text{S-K-V-F-Q-D-A}$\n\nB. $\\text{T-R-I-Y-I-E-V}$\n\nC. $\\text{S-H-A-Q-P-D-A}$\n\nD. $\\text{Q-D-M-A-K-S-W}$\n\nBased on this scoring system, which of the following bacterial peptides is the most likely candidate for molecular mimicry?", "solution": "The human autoantigenic peptide is $\\text{S-K-V-F-L-D-A}$, whose residues belong to the following functional groups: S is Group 3 (polar, uncharged), K is Group 5 (basic), V is Group 1 (aliphatic), F is Group 2 (aromatic), L is Group 1 (aliphatic), D is Group 4 (acidic), and A is Group 1 (aliphatic). The scoring rules are: identity at a position gives +5; a conservative substitution within the same group gives +3; a semi-conservative substitution between Group 1 (aliphatic) and Group 2 (aromatic) gives +1; any other mismatch gives -10.\n\nFor candidate A ($\\text{S-K-V-F-Q-D-A}$), the position-wise comparisons yield: S vs S is identity (+5); K vs K is identity (+5); V vs V is identity (+5); F vs F is identity (+5); L (Group 1) vs Q (Group 3) is non-conservative (-10); D vs D is identity (+5); A vs A is identity (+5).

This is especially complex when the self-antigen is normally hidden from the immune system within our cells. This problem [@problem_id:2250537] presents a scenario that requires you to trace the immunological events from an initial viral infection to the destruction of healthy cells, forcing you to apply your knowledge of antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and the concept of sequestered antigens to solve the puzzle of how tolerance is broken.", "problem": "An individual is infected with a novel, non-lytic virus that specifically targets and replicates within pancreatic beta cells. A viral structural protein, named `VP-11`, contains a short amino acid sequence that is nearly identical to a sequence within a host enzyme called Glucokinase Regulatory Protein (GKRP), which is normally sequestered and confined to the nucleus of pancreatic beta cells. The initial viral infection is successfully cleared by the patient's immune system. However, several weeks later, the patient is diagnosed with autoimmune Type 1 diabetes, resulting from the specific destruction of their own pancreatic beta cells.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, assume the following definitions:\n- **Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I**: Molecules on the surface of all nucleated cells that present peptides from proteins made *inside* the cell (endogenous antigens).\n- **Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class II**: Molecules on the surface of professional Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs) (e.g., dendritic cells, macrophages) that present peptides from proteins taken up from *outside* the cell (exogenous antigens).\n- **Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte (CTL)**: A type of immune cell that kills target cells after recognizing a specific peptide on MHC Class I.\n\nWhich of the following choices most accurately describes the sequence of key events that leads from the initial viral infection to the subsequent autoimmune destruction of healthy, uninfected pancreatic beta cells?\n\nA. Professional APCs engulf viral particles and present the VP-11 peptide on MHC Class I molecules. This activates CTLs, which then mistakenly recognize the similar GKRP peptide on healthy beta cells and destroy them.\n\nB. Antibodies produced against the viral protein VP-11 cross-react with the GKRP protein on the surface of healthy beta cells, marking them for destruction by the complement system.\n\nC. Virus-infected beta cells present the VP-11 peptide on their MHC Class I molecules, activating CTLs. These CTLs kill the infected cells, causing them to release their contents, including the GKRP protein. APCs then take up the released GKRP, process it, and present its peptide on MHC Class II. This process activates a new population of T-cells that orchestrate the attack on remaining healthy beta cells.\n\nD. The initial viral infection causes inflammatory signals that make healthy beta cells express the normally sequestered GKRP protein on their surface via MHC Class I. Pre-existing CTLs that were activated by the virus then recognize this self-peptide and initiate the autoimmune attack.\n\nE. Healthy beta cells constantly present low levels of the GKRP peptide via MHC Class I. During the viral infection, a general state of inflammation lowers the activation threshold for T-cells, allowing CTLs activated by the virus to cross-react with and attack the healthy beta cells.", "solution": "The problem asks for the correct immunological pathway that explains how a viral infection can trigger autoimmunity against a normally sequestered self-antigen through molecular mimicry. Let's analyze the sequence of events step-by-step and evaluate each option.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n1.  **Antigen Presentation:** Endogenous antigens (like viral proteins made inside a cell or normal self-proteins) are presented on MHC Class I molecules. Exogenous antigens (proteins or pathogens taken up from the extracellular environment) are presented on MHC Class II molecules by professional Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs).\n2.  **T-Cell Activation:** Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes (CTLs) are activated when their T-cell receptor recognizes a specific peptide-MHC Class I complex. Helper T-cells are activated by recognizing a peptide-MHC Class II complex on an APC.\n3.  **Molecular Mimicry & Sequestered Antigens:** Autoimmunity can occur when a foreign peptide (from a pathogen) mimics a self-peptide. If the self-peptide is from a sequestered antigen (one not normally exposed to the immune system), then T-cells reactive to it are not deleted during their development (central tolerance). An immune response against the pathogen can thus prime T-cells that can later cross-react with the self-antigen if it becomes exposed.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivation of the Correct Mechanism:**\n\n1.  **Initial Viral Infection:** The virus infects pancreatic beta cells. Inside these cells, the virus replicates, producing viral proteins, including VP-11.\n2.  **Anti-Viral Response Initiation:** The infected beta cells, like all nucleated cells, process their internal proteins (both self and viral) and present fragments on their MHC Class I molecules. The peptide from the viral VP-11 is presented on the surface of infected beta cells.\n3.  **CTL Activation against the Virus:** CTLs with receptors specific for the VP-11 peptide-MHC Class I complex will recognize and become activated.\n4.  **Clearance of Infection and Collateral Damage:** The activated CTLs kill the virus-infected beta cells to eliminate the source of the virus. This cell killing is a normal part of the anti-viral immune response.\n5.  **Release of Sequestered Antigen:** When the beta cells are killed, they rupture and release all their intracellular contents into the surrounding tissue. This includes the normally sequestered nuclear protein, GKRP.\n6.  **Initiation of Autoimmunity:** Professional APCs in the pancreas (e.g., dendritic cells) act as scavengers, cleaning up the debris from the dead cells. They phagocytose the released cellular components, including the free GKRP protein. Because GKRP was taken up from the extracellular environment, the APC processes it via the exogenous pathway.\n7.  **Presentation of Self-Antigen:** The APC presents peptides from the GKRP protein on its MHC Class II molecules. This includes the specific peptide that mimics the viral VP-11 peptide.\n8.  **Activation of Self-Reactive T-cells:** The APC now presents this self-peptide on MHC Class II to helper T-cells. Because GKRP is sequestered, helper T-cells that recognize this peptide may have escaped deletion during thymic selection. These self-reactive helper T-cells become activated.\n9.  **Epitope Spreading and Autoimmune Attack:** The activated helper T-cells can now provide \"help\" to activate other immune cells, including B-cells (to make anti-GKRP antibodies) and, crucially, CTLs that are specific for the GKRP peptide. Even healthy, uninfected beta cells will present very low levels of peptides from their own proteins (like GKRP) on MHC Class I. A newly primed, self-reactive CTL, with help from the activated helper T-cells, can now recognize this self-peptide on healthy beta cells and kill them. This leads to the progressive destruction of the beta cell population, resulting in Type 1 diabetes.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\n*   **A:** Incorrect. Professional APCs present exogenous antigens (like an engulfed virus) on MHC Class II to activate helper T-cells, not on MHC Class I to activate CTLs. The primary activation of CTLs happens by recognizing antigen on the infected tissue cell itself or through a process called cross-presentation, but the mechanism described here is flawed.\n*   **B:** Incorrect. The self-antigen GKRP is sequestered inside the nucleus. Antibodies circulate in the blood and tissue fluid and cannot access intracellular proteins to bind to them on the cell surface.\n*   **C:** Correct. This option accurately describes the full sequence: (1) CTLs clear the initial infection presented on MHC Class I. (2) This killing releases the sequestered self-antigen (GKRP). (3) APCs pick up this released self-antigen and present it on MHC Class II, which is the key step to break tolerance and activate the autoimmune response targeting the self-antigen. The description correctly identifies that this leads to an attack on the remaining healthy cells.\n*   **D:** Incorrect. This reverses the cause and effect. The inflammatory signals are a result of the anti-viral response. Healthy cells do not suddenly start expressing a nuclear protein on MHC Class I at high levels just because of inflammation. The crucial event is the *release* of the protein from dead cells so it can be picked up by APCs.\n*   **E:** Incorrect. While inflammation does lower T-cell activation thresholds, this model misses the critical step of exposing the sequestered antigen. T-cells specific for a self-antigen (even one presented at low levels) are typically deleted or anergized by tolerance mechanisms. The anti-viral response doesn't just \"spill over\"; it fundamentally changes the context by releasing a previously hidden self-antigen, allowing a new primary response to be mounted against it, a process known as epitope spreading.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the most comprehensive and accurate description of the immunological events.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2250537"}, {"introduction": "After identifying a candidate peptide and hypothesizing a mechanism, the final step is to seek direct experimental proof from the affected patient.

The leading hypothesis is molecular mimicry, suggesting that antibodies produced against a bacterial protein are cross-reacting with a human protein in the nervous system. To test this, the lab has isolated the suspected bacterial surface protein, `Bac-P70`, and the structurally similar human neuronal protein, `Neuro-P71`. They also have serum samples from the patient (`Serum-PostInfection`) and from a healthy individual with no history of this infection or neurological condition (`Serum-Control`).\n\nThe proposed experimental technique is an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), a plate-based assay designed to detect and quantify substances such as antibodies. In an indirect ELISA, an antigen is immobilized on a surface, and then a primary antibody (from the serum) is added, which binds to the antigen. A secondary antibody that is linked to an enzyme and recognizes the primary antibody is then added.

Insufficient.\n- B tests both antigens with patient serum; it suggests cross-reactivity if both are positive, but lacks controls with healthy serum to exclude nonspecific or common reactivity. Incomplete.\n- C mismatches sera to antigens and fails to test both sera across both antigens. It cannot distinguish nonspecific binding or background reactivity. Inadequate design.\n- D systematically tests both antigens with both sera, providing positive and negative controls and allowing direct comparison. Molecular mimicry is supported if Serum-PostInfection binds both antigens while Serum-Control is negative or significantly lower on both, especially Neuro-P71.\n- E is a competitive inhibition (blocking) assay showing that Bac-P70 can absorb antibodies that would otherwise bind Neuro-P71, which strongly supports shared epitopes.
