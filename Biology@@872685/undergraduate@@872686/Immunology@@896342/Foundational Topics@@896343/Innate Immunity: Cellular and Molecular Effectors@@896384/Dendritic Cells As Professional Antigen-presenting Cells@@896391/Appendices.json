A crucial part of this process is distinguishing between intracellular pathogens, like viruses, and extracellular ones, like bacteria or toxins. This exercise [@problem_id:2224747] challenges you to apply the fundamental rules of antigen processing to predict which presentation pathway—MHC class I or MHC class II—a dendritic cell will use for different types of antigens, a distinction that ultimately determines which arm of the T cell response is activated.", "problem": "A dendritic cell, a type of professional antigen-presenting cell, is simultaneously exposed to two distinct pathogenic challenges in a tissue environment. The first challenge is a soluble protein toxin, Antigen X, secreted by an extracellular bacterium. The second challenge is an active infection by an intracellular protozoan parasite, which synthesizes its own proteins within the cytoplasm of the dendritic cell; one such protein is Antigen Y. Dendritic cells process these antigens and present peptide fragments on their surface using Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules to activate T-cells.\n\nBased on the canonical pathways for antigen processing and presentation, predict which MHC class of molecules will be predominantly used to present peptides derived from Antigen X and Antigen Y, respectively.\n\nA. Antigen X on MHC class I; Antigen Y on MHC class II.\n\nB. Antigen X on MHC class II; Antigen Y on MHC class I.\n\nC. Both Antigen X and Antigen Y on MHC class I.\n\nD. Both Antigen X and Antigen Y on MHC class II.\n\nE. The presentation pathway for both antigens depends on whether the responding T-cell is a helper or a cytotoxic T-cell, and cannot be determined from the origin of the antigen alone.", "solution": "Step 1: Classify the antigen sources.\n- Antigen X is a soluble protein toxin secreted by an extracellular bacterium. This is an exogenous antigen, acquired from outside the cell by endocytosis or phagocytosis.\n- Antigen Y is synthesized within the cytoplasm of the dendritic cell by an intracellular protozoan parasite. This is an endogenous antigen, produced within the host cell cytosol.\n\nStep 2: Recall the canonical MHC presentation pathways.\n- Exogenous antigens are processed in endosomal/lysosomal compartments and presented on MHC class II molecules. Key features include loading of peptides onto MHC class II in acidified endosomes after removal of the invariant chain/CLIP with the assistance of HLA-DM, leading to presentation to CD4 T cells.\n- Endogenous antigens are processed by the proteasome in the cytosol, peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum by TAP, and loaded onto MHC class I molecules for presentation to CD8 T cells.\n\nStep 3: Apply the pathways to the specific antigens.\n- Antigen X (exogenous soluble toxin) will be predominantly processed via the endosomal pathway and presented on MHC class II.\n- Antigen Y (endogenous, synthesized in the cytosol by an intracellular parasite) will be predominantly processed by the proteasome and presented on MHC class I.\n\nStep 4: Address potential exceptions.\n- While dendritic cells can perform cross-presentation of exogenous antigens on MHC class I, the problem asks for the canonical, predominant pathways. Therefore, the standard mapping applies: exogenous to MHC class II and endogenous to MHC class I.\n\nStep 5: Match to the provided options.\n- This corresponds to Antigen X on MHC class II and Antigen Y on MHC class I, which is option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2224747"}, {"introduction": "Activating a naive T cell is not a simple on/off switch; it requires a carefully orchestrated molecular dialogue with a professional antigen-presenting cell. This interaction is best described by the \"three-signal model,\" which ensures that the T cell response is robust, specific, and appropriate to the threat. This practice [@problem_id:2224765] will test your understanding of this complete activation sequence by asking you to identify the specific receptor-ligand pairs responsible for antigen recognition (Signal 1), co-stimulation (Signal 2), and differentiation (Signal 3).", "problem": "The activation of a naive CD4+ T helper cell is a critical event in initiating an adaptive immune response. This process is orchestrated by a professional Antigen-Presenting Cell (APC), most potently a dendritic cell, which presents processed antigens in secondary lymphoid organs. Full activation and differentiation of the naive T cell requires the successful integration of three distinct signals at the immunological synapse. These are commonly referred to as Signal 1 (antigen-specific activation), Signal 2 (co-stimulatory survival signal), and Signal 3 (differentiation-directing signal).\n\nConsider a scenario where a dendritic cell has processed an exogenous protein antigen and is now interacting with a naive CD4+ T cell specific for a peptide derived from that antigen. Which of the following options correctly identifies the essential molecular pairings for all three signals required to activate this T cell?\n\nA.\n- Signal 1: The T-cell Receptor (TCR) and CD4 co-receptor on the T cell interacting with a peptide presented by a Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHC-II) molecule on the dendritic cell.\n- Signal 2: The CD28 molecule on the T cell interacting with a B7 molecule (CD80/CD86) on the dendritic cell.\n- Signal 3: A cytokine receptor on the T cell interacting with a corresponding cytokine (e.g., Interleukin-12) secreted by the dendritic cell.\n\nB.\n- Signal 1: The TCR and CD8 co-receptor on the T cell interacting with a peptide presented by a Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC-I) molecule on the dendritic cell.\n- Signal 2: The CD28 molecule on the T cell interacting with a B7 molecule on the dendritic cell.\n- Signal 3: A cytokine receptor on the T cell interacting with a corresponding cytokine secreted by the dendritic cell.\n\nC.\n- Signal 1: The TCR and CD4 co-receptor on the T cell interacting with a peptide presented by an MHC-II molecule on the dendritic cell.\n- Signal 2: The Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) on the T cell interacting with a B7 molecule on the dendritic cell.\n- Signal 3: A cytokine receptor on the T cell interacting with a corresponding cytokine secreted by the dendritic cell.\n\nD.\n- Signal 1: The TCR and CD4 co-receptor on the T cell interacting with a peptide presented by an MHC-II molecule on the dendritic cell.\n- Signal 2: The CD40 Ligand (CD40L) on the T cell interacting with the CD40 molecule on the dendritic cell.\n- Signal 3: The LFA-1 integrin on the T cell interacting with the ICAM-1 molecule on the dendritic cell.\n\nE.\n- Signal 1: The B-cell Receptor (BCR) on the T cell interacting with an MHC-II molecule on the dendritic cell.\n- Signal 2: The CD28 molecule on the T cell interacting with a B7 molecule on the dendritic cell.\n- Signal 3: The Fas Ligand (FasL) on the T cell interacting with the Fas receptor on the dendritic cell.", "solution": "A naive CD4+ T helper cell recognizing an exogenous protein antigen requires three coordinated signals delivered by a professional Antigen-Presenting Cell, typically a dendritic cell.\n\nFirst, exogenous protein antigens are processed through the endosomal pathway and loaded onto MHC class II molecules. Therefore, Signal 1 for a naive CD4+ T cell is antigen-specific activation mediated by the TCR recognizing a specific peptide bound to MHC-II on the dendritic cell, with the CD4 co-receptor stabilizing and enhancing TCR signaling.\n\nSecond, full activation requires a co-stimulatory survival signal. The canonical co-stimulatory interaction is CD28 on the T cell binding to B7 family ligands (CD80 and CD86) on the dendritic cell. This signal prevents anergy and supports proliferation and survival.\n\nThird, differentiation into specific T helper subsets is directed by cytokines secreted by the dendritic cell and sensed by cytokine receptors on the T cell. For example, interleukin-12 skews differentiation toward the Th1 lineage; other cytokines direct alternative fates.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A correctly lists Signal 1 as TCR with CD4 recognizing peptide–MHC-II, Signal 2 as CD28–B7 (CD80/CD86), and Signal 3 as cytokine receptor–cytokine (e.g., interleukin-12), matching the established requirements.\n- Option B incorrectly specifies CD8 with MHC-I, which pertains to CD8 cytotoxic T cells and endogenous antigen presentation, not naive CD4+ T cells responding to exogenous antigen.\n- Option C incorrectly uses CTLA-4 for Signal 2; CTLA-4 binding to B7 is inhibitory and dampens activation rather than providing co-stimulation.\n- Option D replaces the co-stimulatory signal with CD40L–CD40, which is important for dendritic cell licensing and B cell help but is not the primary co-stimulatory Signal 2 for T cells; it also mislabels adhesion (LFA-1–ICAM-1) as Signal 3 instead of cytokine-mediated differentiation.\n- Option E is biologically incorrect because T cells do not express a B-cell receptor, and FasL–Fas interactions deliver apoptotic signals rather than activation or differentiation cues.\n\nThus, only Option A correctly identifies all three essential molecular pairings for naive CD4+ T cell activation in this context.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2224765"}, {"introduction": "The immune system has powerful safety mechanisms to prevent accidental activation of T cells against harmless substances or our own tissues. The \"two-signal model\" is a critical checkpoint, demanding that T cells receive both an antigen signal (Signal 1) and a danger signal (Signal 2, or co-stimulation) from a licensed APC to become fully activated. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2224758] explores what happens when this safety check is enforced, asking you to predict the fate of a T cell that receives Signal 1 in the absence of co-stimulation, thereby revealing the important concept of clonal anergy.", "problem": "An immunology researcher is investigating the requirements for the activation of naive CD4+ T cells. They prepare an *in vitro* co-culture system containing two cell populations:\n1. A purified population of naive CD4+ T cells isolated from a mouse. These T cells possess a T Cell Receptor (TCR) that is specific for an antigenic peptide \"PepX\".\n2. A population of mature Dendritic Cells (DCs), which are a type of professional Antigen-Presenting Cell (APC). The researcher has pre-loaded these DCs with PepX, causing them to present the peptide on their Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules. Mature DCs normally express high levels of co-stimulatory ligands.\n\nIn the experimental condition, the researcher adds a high concentration of a specific monoclonal antibody to the culture. This antibody binds to the CD28 receptor on the surface of the T cells, effectively preventing CD28 from interacting with its natural ligands (B7 molecules) on the DCs.\n\nAfter several days of incubation, what is the most probable fate of the naive CD4+ T cells that recognize the PepX-MHC complex on the DCs in this specific experimental condition?\n\nA. They will undergo robust clonal expansion and differentiate into effector T helper cells that secrete cytokines.\n\nB. They will enter a state of clonal anergy, rendering them unresponsive to future stimulation by the same antigen.\n\nC. They will be unaffected and remain in their quiescent, naive state as if they never encountered the DCs.\n\nD. They will immediately undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) upon receiving the signal from the TCR.\n\nE. They will differentiate into memory T cells, preparing them for a more rapid response in the future.", "solution": "The activation of naive CD4+ T cells follows the two-signal model. Define $S_{1}$ as TCR engagement with peptide–MHC class II and $S_{2}$ as co-stimulation via CD28 binding to B7 (CD80/CD86) on the APC. The rule for activation is that clonal expansion and effector differentiation occur only if both $S_{1}=1$ and $S_{2}=1$. In contrast, if $S_{1}=1$ but $S_{2}=0$, naive T cells enter clonal anergy, a state of antigen-specific unresponsiveness.\n\nIn this experiment: (i) the dendritic cells present PepX on MHC class II, so PepX-specific T cells receive $S_{1}=1$ via TCR–PepX–MHC class II interaction; (ii) although mature dendritic cells express B7, the added monoclonal antibody blocks CD28 on T cells, making the effective co-stimulatory signal $S_{2}=0$. Therefore, the condition is $S_{1}=1$ and $S_{2}=0$, which by the two-signal rule leads to anergy rather than activation.\n\nMechanistically, $S_{1}$ alone induces a transcriptional program dominated by NFAT without adequate AP-1 and $NF-\\kappa B$ support, promoting expression of anergy-associated genes (for example, E3 ubiquitin ligases) and failure to produce interleukin-2, resulting in no proliferation or effector differentiation. Over several days, this stabilizes into clonal anergy, making the T cells unresponsive to future encounters with the same antigen even if co-stimulation is later provided.\n\nExcluding alternatives:\n- Robust clonal expansion and effector differentiation (option A) requires $S_{2}=1$, which is prevented here.\n- Remaining quiescent (option C) would require $S_{1}=0$, but $S_{1}=1$ occurs due to TCR recognition of PepX–MHC class II.\n- Immediate apoptosis (option D) is not the canonical fate of naive T cells receiving $S_{1}$ without $S_{2}$; the predominant outcome is anergy, with deletion being context-dependent and not immediate.\n- Differentiation into memory T cells (option E) requires prior activation and expansion, which are absent.\n\nTherefore, the most probable fate is clonal anergy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2224758"}]}
