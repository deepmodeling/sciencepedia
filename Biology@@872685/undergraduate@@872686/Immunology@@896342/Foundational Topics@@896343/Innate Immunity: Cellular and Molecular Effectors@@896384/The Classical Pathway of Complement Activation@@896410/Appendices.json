It is initiated when the C1 complex binds to antibodies that have attached to a pathogen. This binding triggers the catalytic activity of the C1s subunit within the C1 complex. The purpose of this activated C1s is to generate a C3 convertase, an enzyme complex that is crucial for amplifying the downstream effects of the complement cascade. This C3 convertase is formed from fragments of complement components C2 and C4.\n\nConsider a patient with a rare genetic disorder resulting in a complete absence of the C4 protein. All other complement proteins, including C1 and C2, are synthesized normally and are fully functional. Why does the classical pathway fail to proceed to the formation of a C3 convertase in this patient?\n\nA. C4 is required to bind directly to the C1 complex to allosterically activate its C1s enzymatic subunit.\n\nB. C4 must be cleaved by C1s, and its resulting fragment, C4b, provides the necessary docking site for C2, allowing C2 to then be cleaved by C1s.\n\nC. C4 is the enzyme responsible for cleaving C2; the C1 complex's only role is to activate C4.\n\nD. C4 forms a stable, inactive complex with C2 in the bloodstream, and the activation of C1 serves to release active C2 from this complex.\n\nE. C4's primary role is to clear immune complexes; its absence leads to an accumulation of complexes that inhibit the C1 enzyme.", "solution": "The classical complement pathway is initiated when C1q binds antibody Fc regions on a pathogen surface, which activates the associated serine proteases C1r and then C1s. Activated C1s is a serine protease that acts on specific substrates in a defined sequence characteristic of a proteolytic cascade of zymogens.\n\nThe first essential substrate of C1s in the classical pathway is C4. C1s cleaves C4 into C4a and C4b. C4b exposes a reactive thioester that allows it to covalently attach to the pathogen surface in the vicinity of the activated C1 complex. This surface-bound C4b then serves as the necessary docking site for C2. C2 binds to C4b to form the proconvertase C4bC2. While C2 is bound to C4b, C1s cleaves C2 to generate the fragments commonly designated C2a (the larger fragment that remains associated) and C2b (the smaller released fragment). The complex C4b2a formed on the pathogen surface is the classical pathway C3 convertase.\n\nIn the complete absence of C4, activated C1s has no C4 substrate to cleave and therefore cannot generate C4b. Without C4b, there is no docking platform for C2 on the pathogen surface, and C1s cannot produce the surface-bound C4b2a C3 convertase. Thus, despite normal C1 and C2, the pathway fails at the step of C3 convertase formation because C4b is indispensable for recruiting and positioning C2 for C1s-mediated cleavage and for assembling the C4b2a enzyme complex. This mechanism corresponds to the statement that C4 must be cleaved by C1s and its fragment C4b provides the docking site for C2, allowing subsequent C2 cleavage by C1s.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. The other options are incorrect: C4 does not allosterically activate C1s (A), C4 is not the enzyme for C2 cleavage (C), C4 and C2 do not circulate as a stable inactive complex awaiting C1 activation (D), and while C4 deficiency can impair immune complex clearance, that is not the mechanistic reason the C3 convertase fails to form in this scenario (E).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2274724"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theory to practice, this problem puts you in the role of a clinical immunologist. You will use data from a classic laboratory assay, the Total Hemolytic Complement (CH50) test, to diagnose a complement deficiency. This exercise hones your logical reasoning skills by showing how understanding the complement cascade's sequence allows you to interpret experimental results and identify the exact point of failure in the pathway [@problem_id:2274746].", "problem": "A patient's serum is analyzed for classical complement pathway activity using a Total Hemolytic Complement (CH50) assay. This assay measures the ability of serum to lyse antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes (red blood cells). A complete and functional classical pathway, from C1 through C9, is required to form the terminal Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) and cause cell lysis.\n\nThe initial assay using only the patient's serum results in a complete absence of erythrocyte lysis, indicating a functional defect somewhere in the classical pathway. To identify the specific deficient component, the laboratory performs a series of mixing studies. In each separate study, the patient's serum is incubated with the antibody-sensitized erythrocytes along with one specific, purified, and functional complement component. The results are as follows:\n\n- **Study 1:** Addition of purified C1 complex -> No lysis observed.\n- **Study 2:** Addition of purified C4 -> No lysis observed.\n- **Study 3:** Addition of purified C2 -> Normal lysis observed.\n- **Study 4:** Addition of purified C3 -> No lysis observed.\n\nBased on these findings, which of the following complement components is the patient most likely deficient in?\n\nA. C1\n\nB. C2\n\nC. C3\n\nD. C4", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify a deficient complement component based on the results of a CH50 assay and subsequent mixing studies. To solve this, we must understand the sequence of events in the classical complement pathway and how the mixing studies work to pinpoint a deficiency.\n\nFirst, let's review the activation sequence of the early classical complement pathway, which leads to cell lysis:\n1.  The pathway is initiated when the C1 complex (composed of C1q, C1r, and C1s) binds to antibodies that are attached to an antigen on a target surface (in this case, the sheep erythrocytes).\n2.  Binding activates the C1 complex, which becomes an enzyme.\n3.  Activated C1 cleaves C4 into two fragments, C4a and C4b. C4b covalently attaches to the target surface.\n4.  Activated C1 also cleaves C2 into C2a and C2b. The larger fragment (C2a) binds to the surface-bound C4b.\n5.  The combination of C4b and C2a forms the C4b2a complex, which is the classical pathway C3 convertase. This is a critical enzymatic step.\n6.  The C3 convertase cleaves large amounts of C3 into C3a and C3b. C3b molecules coat the cell surface.\n7.  Subsequent steps involving C5, C6, C7, C8, and C9 lead to the formation of the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC), which punches a hole in the cell membrane, causing lysis.\n\nThe principle of a mixing study is that if you add the *specific* component that is missing or non-functional in the patient's serum, you will restore the entire pathway's function, and lysis will occur. If adding a component does not cause lysis, it implies that the deficiency lies elsewhere, specifically downstream of the added component.\n\nNow, let's analyze the experimental results step-by-step:\n- **Initial Result (Patient serum alone):** No lysis. This confirms there is a break in the C1-C9 sequence.\n\n- **Study 1 (Addition of purified C1):** No lysis. If the patient were deficient in C1, adding functional C1 would have restored the pathway and caused lysis (assuming C2, C3, C4, etc., are present). Since lysis did not occur, we can conclude that the patient is not deficient in C1, and the defect must be \"downstream\" of C1 (i.e., in C4, C2, C3, or later components).\n\n- **Study 2 (Addition of purified C4):** No lysis. Similar to the C1 study, if the patient were C4 deficient, adding functional C4 would have repaired the pathway. The lack of lysis indicates the patient has functional C4, and the defect is downstream of C4's action.\n\n- **Study 3 (Addition of purified C2):** Normal lysis observed. This is the crucial result. The addition of functional C2 protein successfully restored the entire lytic pathway. This could only happen if all components *before* C2 (C1, C4) and all components *after* C2 (C3, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9) were present and functional in the patient's serum. The only missing piece was C2. Adding it allowed the formation of the C3 convertase (C4b2a), enabling the rest of the cascade to proceed to completion.\n\n- **Study 4 (Addition of purified C3):** No lysis. This result confirms that C3 is not the deficient component. If C3 were deficient, adding it would have restored lysis. The reason no lysis occurs here is that the step *required to activate C3* is blocked. Specifically, the C3 convertase (C4b2a) cannot be formed because of the lack of endogenous C2. Therefore, even with an abundance of added C3, it cannot be cleaved to C3b to continue the pathway.\n\nBased on this logical deduction, the restoration of lysis exclusively upon the addition of purified C2 indicates that the patient is deficient in complement component C2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2274746"}, {"introduction": "The formation of the C3 convertase is not the end of the story; it is the beginning of a massive amplification step.
