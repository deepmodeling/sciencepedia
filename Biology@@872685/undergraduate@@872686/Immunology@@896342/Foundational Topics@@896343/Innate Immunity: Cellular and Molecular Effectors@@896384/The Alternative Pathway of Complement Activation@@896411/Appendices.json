However, this amplification is not without cost, as it consumes key protein components from the plasma. This first practice problem uses the real-world scenario of sepsis to explore the dynamics of component consumption, specifically focusing on Factor B, helping you to understand its role as a consumable substrate rather than a catalyst in the formation of the $C3$ convertase [@problem_id:2273430].", "problem": "A patient is diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening systemic inflammatory response triggered by a widespread bacterial infection. The surfaces of many bacteria are potent activators of the complement system. A key part of the initial innate immune response to such pathogens is the alternative pathway of complement activation. This pathway involves the protein Factor B. In the presence of a target surface like a bacterium, C3b (a fragment of complement component 3) binds to the surface. Factor B then binds to this surface-bound C3b, forming a C3bB complex. This complex is subsequently cleaved by a plasma protease, Factor D, which consumes Factor B to help form an enzyme complex that perpetuates the complement cascade.\n\nGiven the massive and sustained activation of the alternative pathway during a severe systemic bacterial infection, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected change in the plasma concentration of Factor B?\n\nA. The concentration of Factor B will significantly increase as the liver upregulates its production as part of the acute phase response to the infection.\n\nB. The concentration of Factor B will remain relatively stable because it is a catalytic component and is regenerated after each reaction cycle.\n\nC. The concentration of Factor B will be unaffected because the classical pathway, which does not use Factor B, is the dominant complement pathway for eliminating bacterial pathogens.\n\nD. The concentration of Factor B will significantly decrease because it is continuously consumed as a substrate in the formation of the alternative pathway's C3 convertase.", "solution": "We use the mechanistic steps of the alternative complement pathway and the role of Factor B.\n\n1) Surface deposition and binding:\nWhen bacterial surfaces are present, spontaneously generated $C3b$ binds to the microbial surface. Factor B (denoted $B$) binds to surface-bound $C3b$ to form the pro-convertase:\n$$\nC3b + B \\longrightarrow C3bB.\n$$\n\n2) Proteolytic cleavage by Factor D:\nFactor D (denoted $D$), a serine protease, cleaves the bound Factor B within $C3bB$ into fragments $Ba$ and $Bb$. The $Bb$ fragment remains associated with $C3b$ to form the active alternative pathway C3 convertase $C3bBb$:\n$$\nC3bB + D \\longrightarrow C3bBb + Ba + D.\n$$\nHere, $D$ acts catalytically and is not consumed, whereas $B$ is cleaved into products; thus $B$ is used stoichiometrically as a substrate to form the enzyme complex.\n\n3) Amplification and continuous consumption:\nThe $C3bBb$ convertase cleaves additional $C3$ to generate more $C3b$, which can bind more $B$, perpetuating the cycle. During massive and sustained activation (as in severe systemic bacterial infection), the flux through the reactions above increases, leading to continuous consumption of $B$ into $Ba$ and $Bb$ fragments. Because $B$ is not regenerated in the reaction cycle (unlike $D$), its plasma concentration decreases with ongoing activation.\n\n4) Consideration of acute-phase production:\nAlthough the liver can upregulate synthesis of many complement components during the acute-phase response, in severe sepsis the rate of consumption of Factor B in forming $C3bBb$ typically exceeds the rate of production, leading to a net decrease in plasma Factor B levels. This is analogous to the well-described decreases in $C3$ and other alternative pathway components during strong activation.\n\n5) Elimination of incorrect options:\n- Option A is less accurate: while acute-phase upregulation occurs, consumption outpaces production in massive activation, so net levels fall rather than significantly increase.\n- Option B is incorrect because Factor B is not catalytic; it is proteolytically consumed to form $Bb$ in the convertase.\n- Option C is incorrect because the alternative pathway is a key early and continuous amplifier against bacterial surfaces; it is not bypassed by the classical pathway in this context.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that Factor B concentration significantly decreases due to continuous consumption as a substrate in forming the alternative pathway C3 convertase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2273430"}, {"introduction": "While the formation of the $C3$ convertase, $C3bBb$, is central to the alternative pathway, this complex is inherently unstable. To ensure a robust and sustained response against pathogens, the system employs positive regulators. This exercise examines the role of properdin, a key positive regulator, by exploring the consequences of its absence, thereby highlighting how stability is crucial for the amplification loop to function effectively [@problem_id:2273435].", "problem": "A patient is diagnosed with a rare X-linked genetic disorder characterized by the complete inability to produce functional properdin (also known as Factor P). Properdin is a plasma protein involved in the innate immune response. The patient's classical and lectin complement pathways are found to be functionally intact. Considering the known mechanisms of the complement system, which of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate and primary biochemical consequence for the alternative pathway of complement activation in this patient?\n\nA. The C3 convertase of the alternative pathway, C3bBb, will have a severely reduced half-life, preventing effective amplification of the complement cascade.\n\nB. The initial spontaneous hydrolysis of complement component C3 to C3(H₂O), which initiates the pathway, will be completely blocked.\n\nC. The cleavage of Factor B into Ba and Bb by Factor D will be inhibited, preventing the formation of any C3 convertase.\n\nD. The formation of the C5 convertase from the C3 convertase will be directly blocked, even if the C3 convertase itself is stable.\n\nE. Uncontrolled activation of the alternative pathway will occur on host cells, as properdin is the primary negative regulator of the cascade.", "solution": "The alternative pathway of complement activation proceeds via continuous low-level spontaneous hydrolysis of $C3$ in plasma, a process often termed “tickover.” This yields $C3(\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O})$, which can bind Factor B ($B$). Factor D ($D$) then cleaves $B$ into Ba and Bb, generating the fluid-phase $C3$ convertase $C3(\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O})Bb$, which cleaves $C3$ to $C3a$ and $C3b$. Surface-deposited $C3b$ binds $B$, and $D$ cleaves $B$ to form the surface-bound alternative pathway $C3$ convertase $C3bBb$. This $C3$ convertase then amplifies the pathway by generating more $C3b$, which further propagates convertase formation, and with an additional $C3b$ can form the $C5$ convertase $C3bBbC3b$.\n\nProperdin (Factor P), denoted here as $P$, is a positive regulator of the alternative pathway. It binds to and stabilizes the $C3$ convertase $C3bBb$, markedly increasing its half-life on microbial surfaces. Properdin can also facilitate assembly of the convertase on pathogen surfaces. In the absence of $P$, the $C3bBb$ complex is intrinsically unstable and decays rapidly due to its short natural half-life and the action of regulatory proteins such as Factor H and decay-accelerating factor. Thus, without properdin, the immediate and primary biochemical consequence is a severely reduced stability (half-life) of the alternative pathway $C3$ convertase $C3bBb$, which impairs the amplification loop.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A states that the alternative pathway $C3$ convertase $C3bBb$ will have a severely reduced half-life, preventing effective amplification. This directly reflects the known role of properdin as a stabilizer of $C3bBb$ and is correct.\n- Option B claims that the initial spontaneous hydrolysis of $C3$ to $C3(\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O})$ will be completely blocked. This hydrolysis is an intrinsic property of $C3$ and does not require properdin; therefore, this is incorrect.\n- Option C claims that cleavage of Factor B by $D$ will be inhibited. Factor D cleaves $B$ when $B$ is bound to $C3b$ or $C3(\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O})$, and this process does not require properdin; therefore, this is incorrect.\n- Option D claims direct blockade of $C5$ convertase formation even if $C3$ convertase is stable. Properdin does not directly block $C5$ convertase formation; rather, its absence destabilizes $C3bBb$, indirectly reducing $C5$ convertase formation. The immediate and primary effect is on $C3bBb$ stability, not a direct block at $C5$ convertase.\n- Option E asserts uncontrolled activation on host cells because properdin is the primary negative regulator. Properdin is a positive regulator; negative regulators include Factor H, Factor I, DAF, and MCP. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n\nHence, the most accurate statement is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2273435"}, {"introduction": "A system as powerful as the complement cascade must be tightly controlled to prevent it from running unchecked and damaging host tissues. This is achieved through a suite of negative regulatory proteins. In this problem, you will analyze the consequences of a deficiency in Factor I, a critical enzyme that acts as a permanent \"off-switch\" by inactivating $C3b$. This scenario demonstrates how a breakdown in negative regulation leads to uncontrolled component consumption and severe clinical consequences [@problem_id:2273448].", "problem": "The complement system is a crucial component of the innate immune response. Its alternative pathway provides immediate, non-specific defense against pathogens. This pathway is initiated by the spontaneous hydrolysis of the C3 protein, which leads to the formation of a C3 convertase enzyme complex (C3bBb). This enzyme cleaves more C3 molecules, creating a powerful amplification loop. To prevent excessive activation and damage to host tissues, this process is tightly regulated. A key regulatory enzyme is Factor I, a plasma serine protease that permanently inactivates the C3b protein, a central component of the C3 convertase.\n\nConsider a patient with a rare genetic disorder resulting in a complete deficiency of functional Factor I.

Markedly low plasma C3 levels and a decreased susceptibility to pyogenic bacterial infections.\n\nE. Normal plasma C3 levels and normal susceptibility to pyogenic bacterial infections.", "solution": "1) Core mechanism: In the alternative pathway, spontaneous hydrolysis of $C3$ generates $C3b$ that binds Factor B; Factor D then cleaves Factor B to form the C3 convertase $C3bBb$. This enzyme cleaves additional $C3$, creating a positive feedback amplification loop. Regulation requires permanent inactivation of $C3b$ by Factor I (with cofactors such as Factor H, CR1, and MCP), converting $C3b$ to inactive fragments (for example, $iC3b$) and thereby terminating further C3 convertase formation.\n\n2) Effect of Factor I deficiency on complement dynamics: In the absence of functional Factor I, $C3b$ cannot be inactivated. Persisting $C3b$ supports continuous formation of C3 convertase ($C3bBb$), which sustains and accelerates cleavage of $C3$. This leads to uncontrolled activation and consumption of $C3$. Therefore, plasma $C3$ levels become markedly low due to ongoing consumption.\n\n3) Consequences for host defense: $C3b$ and its breakdown product $iC3b$ are major opsonins. Markedly reduced effective $C3b$/$iC3b$ opsonization impairs phagocytosis of pyogenic (encapsulated) bacteria. Clinically, this results in increased susceptibility to pyogenic bacterial infections.\n\n4) Synthesis of clinical and laboratory findings: The expected laboratory finding is markedly low plasma $C3$ levels (due to consumption), and the expected clinical finding is increased susceptibility to pyogenic bacterial infections (due to impaired opsonization).
