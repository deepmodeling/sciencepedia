In immunology, flow cytometry is an indispensable technique for dissecting cell populations. This first exercise challenges you to think like a laboratory scientist designing an experiment to isolate these unique lymphocytes from a sea of other cells, based on their definitive molecular signature [@problem_id:2285809].", "problem": "An immunologist is designing a flow cytometry experiment to quantify a rare lymphocyte population, the γδ T cells, from a human peripheral blood sample. The experimental strategy involves using fluorescently-labeled antibodies to identify cells based on their surface protein expression. It is known that all mature T cells universally express the CD3 protein complex as part of their T-cell Receptor (TCR). T cells are broadly divided into two distinct lineages based on the composition of their TCR: the conventional αβ T cells and the unconventional γδ T cells.\n\nThe researcher's goal is to use a two-marker strategy to specifically and positively identify the γδ T cell population. The first marker is an antibody against CD3, which will be used to gate on all T cells present in the sample. To then distinguish the γδ T cells from the more numerous αβ T cells within this CD3-positive gate, the researcher must select a single additional antibody.\n\nWhich of the following antibodies would serve as the most effective and comprehensive *positive* marker for identifying the entire γδ T cell lineage from the initial population of all T cells?\n\nA. An antibody against the CD4 co-receptor.\n\nB. An antibody against the CD8 co-receptor.\n\nC. An antibody that recognizes the constant region of the TCR β-chain.\n\nD.

An antibody against the Natural Killer cell marker CD56.", "solution": "We are asked to identify the single most effective and comprehensive positive marker to distinguish the entire γδ T cell lineage within a CD3-positive T cell gate using flow cytometry.\n\nLogical framework:\n- Principle: All mature T cells express CD3; thus, gating on CD3 selects the T cell compartment.\n- Requirement: Within CD3-positive cells, we need a marker that is both specific to γδ T cells and comprehensive (i.e., labels all γδ T cells), serving as a positive identifier.\n- Lineage biology: T cells are divided into αβ and γδ lineages according to their TCR chain composition. A lineage-defining constant region epitope is ideal for comprehensive positive identification.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A (anti-CD4): CD4 is a co-receptor primarily on helper αβ T cells and is absent on many γδ T cells. It is neither specific to γδ nor comprehensive for them. Therefore, not suitable.\n- B (anti-CD8): CD8 is a co-receptor typically on cytotoxic αβ T cells; some γδ T cells may express CD8αα, but many do not. It is not specific to γδ and not comprehensive for them. Therefore, not suitable.\n- C (anti-TCR β constant region): This positively labels the αβ T cell lineage and excludes γδ T cells. It functions as a negative marker for γδ but does not provide positive identification of γδ cells as required. Therefore, not suitable.\n- D (anti-TCR δ constant region): The TCR δ-chain is a defining component of the γδ TCR, present on all γδ T cells and absent from αβ T cells. Targeting the constant region ensures recognition across all variable region diversity, making it both specific and comprehensive for the entire γδ lineage. Therefore, this is the ideal positive marker.\n- E (anti-CD56): CD56 is a marker for natural killer cells; it can also be expressed on some T cells (including some γδ and NKT subsets) but is neither specific to γδ T cells nor comprehensively expressed by them. Therefore, not suitable.\n\nConclusion: The antibody recognizing the constant region of the TCR δ-chain is the most effective comprehensive positive marker for γδ T cells within the CD3-positive T cell population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2285809"}, {"introduction": "One of the most fascinating aspects of γδ T cells is their ability to act as sentinels, providing a rapid, first line of defense that bypasses the rules of conventional adaptive immunity. This thought experiment places you in a scenario where the classical MHC class I-dependent pathway for clearing viral infections is broken. By solving this immunological puzzle, you'll uncover the critical role of γδ T cells in recognizing cellular stress, a mechanism that is vital for immune surveillance at mucosal surfaces [@problem_id:2285873].", "problem": "A virology research team is studying a patient with a rare genetic disorder affecting the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) protein complex. This defect results in a complete failure to load endogenous peptides onto Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules. Consequently, the patient's intestinal epithelial cells are unable to express MHC class I on their surface. Despite this deficiency, which would normally cripple the cytotoxic T lymphocyte response, the patient is observed to mount a surprisingly effective and rapid cytotoxic response against a localized, non-lytic viral infection within the gut mucosa, successfully clearing the virus by inducing apoptosis in infected epithelial cells.\n\nWhich of the following hypotheses provides the most plausible explanation for the observed MHC-I-independent cytotoxic T-cell activity in the patient's intestine?\n\nA. Conventional CD8+ αβ T cells are activated in the lymph nodes by dendritic cells that have cross-presented viral antigens, and these T cells then return to the gut to kill infected epithelial cells.\n\nB. Viral antigens are presented on MHC class II molecules on the surface of infected epithelial cells, which are then recognized and killed by a specialized population of cytotoxic CD4+ αβ T cells.\n\nC. Intraepithelial γδ T cells, a population of T cells abundant in mucosal tissues, are activated by recognizing stress-induced ligands expressed on the surface of the virally infected epithelial cells.\n\nD. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the gut are converted into cytotoxic cells upon encountering viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), leading to the elimination of infected cells.\n\nE. Natural Killer T (NKT) cells recognize viral glycolipid antigens presented by the non-classical MHC molecule CD1d on infected epithelial cells, triggering a cytotoxic response.", "solution": "TAP deficiency prevents the transport of endogenous peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum, so peptide loading onto MHC class I fails. As a result, infected epithelial cells lack surface MHC class I. Conventional cytotoxic CD8$^{+}$ T lymphocytes require recognition of specific peptide–MHC class I complexes on target cells to exert cytotoxicity; therefore, in the absence of MHC class I on intestinal epithelial cells, classical CD8$^{+}$ αβ T cells cannot mediate killing of these infected targets.\n\nEvaluate each hypothesis in light of this constraint and known mucosal immunology:\n- Option A is implausible because, although cross-presentation by dendritic cells in lymph nodes can prime conventional CD8$^{+}$ αβ T cells, their effector function still requires cognate peptide–MHC class I on the infected epithelial targets, which is absent due to the TAP defect.\n- Option B is unlikely because intestinal epithelial cells generally do not express MHC class II; while IFN-γ can induce some MHC class II in nonprofessional cells, cytotoxic CD4$^{+}$ αβ T-cell killing of epithelial targets via MHC class II is not the typical or rapid mechanism in this context.\n- Option C is the most plausible. Intraepithelial γδ T cells are abundant in mucosal epithelia and can recognize stress-induced ligands (for example, MICA/MICB) via receptors such as NKG2D, independent of classical MHC class I. Upon recognizing these stress signals on virally infected or transformed epithelial cells, γδ T cells can rapidly induce apoptosis through perforin/granzyme release or Fas–FasL interactions, providing an MHC-I-independent cytotoxic response well suited to the gut mucosa.\n- Option D is not supported by established mechanisms; regulatory T cells do not commonly convert into cytotoxic effectors in response to PAMPs in a way that would account for rapid, effective epithelial cytotoxicity.\n- Option E is less plausible because invariant NKT cells recognize lipid antigens presented by CD1d; most viruses do not provide glycolipid antigens, and the option’s mechanism hinges on “viral glycolipid” presentation, which is atypical for viral infections of epithelial cells.\n\nTherefore, the observed rapid, MHC-I-independent cytotoxicity in the gut mucosa is best explained by activation of intraepithelial γδ T cells recognizing stress-induced ligands on infected epithelial cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2285873"}, {"introduction": "While γδ T cells are essential for host defense, their potent inflammatory capabilities can also drive autoimmune diseases like psoriasis. This final practice bridges basic immunology with clinical application, tasking you with a drug design challenge. To develop a therapy that is both effective and safe, you must identify a molecular target that is highly specific to the pathogenic γδ T cell subset, illustrating how a deep understanding of cellular differentiation pathways is key to modern medicine [@problem_id:2285819].", "problem": "Psoriasis is an autoimmune skin disease characterized by chronic inflammation. A key pathogenic cell type implicated in the formation of psoriatic lesions is a subset of γδ T cells that reside in the skin and produce a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine, Interleukin-17 (IL-17). These cells are often referred to as γδT17 cells.\n\nA biotechnology firm aims to develop a novel therapeutic drug that specifically inhibits the inflammatory function of these pathogenic γδT17 cells, with the goal of minimizing \"off-target\" effects on other beneficial or unrelated lymphocyte populations. You are tasked with evaluating several potential molecular targets for this new drug.\n\nGiven the descriptions below, which molecular target would provide the highest degree of specificity for inhibiting the IL-17-producing function of the pathogenic γδ T cell subset involved in psoriasis, while sparing the widest range of other T cell functions?\n\nA. **CD3**: A protein complex associated with the T cell receptor on the surface of all T cells, essential for signal transduction upon antigen recognition.\n\nB. **The γδ T Cell Receptor (TCR)**: The unique antigen receptor that defines all γδ T cells, distinguishing them from conventional αβ T cells.\n\nC. **The IL-17 Receptor (IL-17R)**: A cell surface receptor found on various cell types, including keratinocytes in the skin, which binds to IL-17 and initiates a downstream inflammatory signaling cascade.\n\nD. **ROR$\\gamma$t (Retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma t)**: An intracellular transcription factor that is considered the master regulator for the differentiation and function of all IL-17-producing T cells, including both γδT17 and conventional Th17 cells.\n\nE. **CCR6 (C-C chemokine receptor type 6)**: A cell surface chemokine receptor expressed by γδT17 and Th17 cells that directs their migration to inflamed tissues, such as the skin, by responding to the chemokine CCL20.", "solution": "We need a target that is as specific as possible for the IL-17-producing function of pathogenic skin-resident γδT17 cells, while sparing other T cell functions and unrelated lymphocyte populations.\n\nEvaluate each option against specificity for IL-17-producing function and sparing other T cells:\n\nA. CD3 is a universal component of TCR signaling on all T cells (both αβ and γδ). Inhibiting CD3 would broadly suppress activation across essentially all T cells, which is not specific to IL-17 producers. Therefore, this has poor specificity and high off-target impact on T cell functions.\n\nB. The γδ TCR is present on all γδ T cells irrespective of cytokine profile. Targeting it would inhibit beneficial γδ T cell subsets (e.g., IFN-γ producers, tissue surveillance, wound repair) in multiple tissues. It is not specific for IL-17-producing function and would still spare αβ T cells, but it is overly broad within the γδ compartment. Thus, it lacks the desired functional specificity.\n\nC. The IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) is broadly expressed on many non-lymphoid and myeloid cells (e.g., keratinocytes, fibroblasts, epithelial cells). Blocking IL-17R would prevent downstream signaling from IL-17 irrespective of its cellular source (Th17, γδT17, ILC3, etc.). While this would spare intrinsic T cell receptor signaling and many other T cell functions, it is not specific to the pathogenic γδT17 subset and would broadly neutralize IL-17 biology across tissues, with attendant risks to host defense. Hence, it is less specific to the target cell subset.\n\nD. ROR$\\gamma$t is the lineage-defining transcription factor for IL-17-producing T cells and is required for differentiation and effector function of both γδT17 and Th17 cells. Inhibiting ROR$\\gamma$t directly suppresses the IL-17 transcriptional program, targeting the specific cytokine-producing function while largely sparing other T cell lineages (Th1, Th2, Treg, cytotoxic CD8) and non-IL-17 γδ T cell functions. Although it also affects Th17, among the listed options it provides the highest functional specificity for IL-17 production and best preserves unrelated T cell functions.\n\nE. CCR6 controls trafficking to CCL20-rich inflamed tissues and is expressed by γδT17 and Th17 cells, but also by other immune cells (e.g., some Tregs, memory B cells, dendritic cells). Blocking CCR6 would modulate migration rather than specifically suppress IL-17 production, and would affect multiple cell types beyond the target subset. Therefore, it is less specific for inhibiting the IL-17-producing function.\n\nComparative conclusion: ROR$\\gamma$t most specifically targets the IL-17-producing program itself across relevant T17 lineages while sparing the widest range of other T cell functions among the provided choices.
