This exercise [@problem_id:2278975] challenges you to think critically about the structure of an antibody and predict how removing a key part, the Fragment, crystallizable (Fc) region, impacts its ability to bridge the gap between a bacterium and a macrophage.", "problem": "An immunology laboratory is investigating the mechanisms of phagocytosis using cultured macrophages and a specific strain of bacterium, *Bacterium exempli*. They quantify the efficiency of this process using a \"Phagocytic Index,\" defined as the average number of bacteria ingested per macrophage over a 30-minute incubation period.\n\nIn their first experiment (Control), they mix the macrophages with *B. exempli* and observe a Phagocytic Index of 5. This represents the basal level of phagocytosis.\n\nIn their second experiment (Opsonized), they first coat the *B. exempli* with a specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody that binds to the bacterial surface. When these opsonized bacteria are mixed with the macrophages, the Phagocytic Index is observed to be 100.\n\nFor a third experiment (Modified Opsonin), the researchers plan to use a proteolytic enzyme that specifically cleaves the IgG antibody, completely removing its Fragment, crystallizable (Fc) portion while leaving the two Fragment, antigen-binding (Fab) regions connected and functional. This modified antibody fragment will then be used to coat the bacteria before incubation with the macrophages.\n\nAssuming the enzyme treatment has no other effects, what is the most likely Phagocytic Index that will be observed in this third experiment?\n\nA. 0\n\nB. 5\n\nC. 50\n\nD. 95\n\nE. 100", "solution": "Let $PI$ denote the Phagocytic Index. The control experiment gives the basal value\n$$PI_{\\text{control}}=5.$$\nOpsonization with intact Immunoglobulin G (IgG) raises the index to\n$$PI_{\\text{IgG}}=100,$$\nbecause macrophage Fc receptors (Fc$\\gamma$ receptors) bind the Fc region of IgG attached to bacteria, which enhances phagocytosis.\n\nIn the third experiment, the IgG is proteolytically cleaved to remove the Fc portion while keeping the two Fab regions connected and functional, yielding an $F(ab')_{2}$-type fragment. This fragment can still bind antigen on the bacterial surface via Fab, but it lacks the Fc region required for engagement of Fc$\\gamma$ receptors on macrophages. Therefore, Fc receptor-mediated opsonization is abolished. Under the stated assumption that there are no other effects, there is no enhancement of phagocytosis beyond the basal level. Hence the expected index returns to baseline:\n$$PI_{\\text{modified}}=PI_{\\text{control}}=5.$$\nAmong the provided options, this corresponds to choice B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2278975"}, {"introduction": "Once a pathogen is recognized, the phagocyte must physically engulf it in a dynamic process of membrane remodeling. This cellular feat is powered by the actin cytoskeleton, which rapidly assembles to push the cell membrane forward and form a phagocytic cup. In this scenario [@problem_id:2279010], you will explore the direct consequences of inhibiting this machinery, revealing the indispensable role of actin polymerization in the capture phase of phagocytosis.", "problem": "A researcher is conducting an in-vitro experiment to study the cellular mechanics of the innate immune system. A sample of human neutrophils is co-cultured with bacteria that have been opsonized with antibodies. To investigate the role of the cytoskeleton, the researcher treats one group of these neutrophils with Cytochalasin D, a mycotoxin known to specifically bind to the barbed end of actin filaments and block both the polymerization and the elongation of actin. The researcher then observes the interaction between the drug-treated neutrophils and the opsonized bacteria under a microscope.\n\nWhich of the following describes the most immediate and primary consequence of the Cytochalasin D treatment on the process of phagocytosis?\n\nA. The neutrophils will be unable to extend pseudopods to engulf the bacteria, thus arresting the formation of a phagosome.\n\nB. The neutrophils will be unable to migrate towards the chemical signals released by the bacteria.\n\nC. A phagosome will successfully form around a bacterium, but it will fail to fuse with a lysosome to form a phagolysosome.\n\nD. The neutrophils will successfully engulf and destroy the bacteria, but will be unable to present bacterial antigens on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules.\n\nE. The antibodies will be unable to bind to the surface of the bacteria, preventing opsonization.", "solution": "Cytochalasin D specifically binds to the barbed (plus) ends of actin filaments and blocks actin polymerization and elongation. In Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis of opsonized bacteria, engagement of Fc receptors triggers rapid actin polymerization at the cell membrane to form the phagocytic cup. This actin-driven process underlies the extension of pseudopods that wrap around the particle and culminates in closure of the membrane around the target to form a phagosome.\n\nBecause the formation and extension of pseudopods is an actin-dependent process, inhibition of actin polymerization immediately prevents the neutrophil from generating the phagocytic cup and from enclosing the bacterium, thereby arresting phagosome formation at the earliest step. This is the primary and most immediate defect in phagocytosis with Cytochalasin D.\n\nIn contrast, while chemotaxis (cell migration toward chemoattractants) is also actin dependent, the question asks specifically for the primary consequence on the process of phagocytosis observed during interaction with opsonized bacteria; failure of pseudopod extension directly blocks phagocytic cup formation. Fusion of formed phagosomes with lysosomes depends more critically on microtubule-based trafficking rather than actin polymerization, so a selective actin polymerization inhibitor would not primarily cause a phagosome–lysosome fusion defect. Neutrophils are not major MHC class II antigen-presenting cells, and opsonization is a property of antibodies binding bacterial antigens, independent of neutrophil actin dynamics.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and primary consequence of Cytochalasin D in this context is the inability to extend pseudopods and form a phagosome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2279010"}, {"introduction": "Beyond understanding the mechanisms, a key skill in immunology is quantifying cellular processes to assess their efficiency.
