A powerful modern strategy for this is the De Bruijn graph, which simplifies the problem by breaking reads into even smaller, overlapping \"k-mers\" of a fixed length $k$. This exercise [@problem_id:2290987] allows you to step into the role of an assembly algorithm, constructing a De Bruijn graph from a set of k-mers and tracing the path that reconstructs the original DNA sequence.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is performing *de novo* genome assembly on a short, linear DNA fragment from a newly discovered extremophilic bacterium. The sequencing process yielded a collection of short, overlapping reads. To reconstruct the original DNA sequence, the biologist employs a De Bruijn graph assembly strategy. The process begins by breaking down all the sequencing reads into a complete set of k-mers, which are short substrings of a fixed length $k$.\n\nFor this particular assembly, a value of $k=4$ was used. The complete, unordered set of all 4-mers obtained from the reads is:\n`{ ATGC, TGCG, GCGT, CGTA, GTAC, TACG, ACGT, CGTG }`\n\nYou are tasked with reconstructing the original, contiguous DNA sequence from this set of 4-mers. To do this, you must first construct the corresponding De Bruijn graph. In this specific graph model:\n1.  The nodes (or vertices) of the graph are all the unique (k-1)-mers. A (k-1)-mer is a sequence of length $k-1=3$. These nodes are derived from the prefixes (the first 3 bases) and suffixes (the last 3 bases) of every 4-mer in the given set.\n2.  A directed edge is drawn from a node `U` to a node `V` if and only if there exists a 4-mer in the set whose prefix is `U` and whose suffix is `V`. Each 4-mer in the set corresponds to exactly one directed edge in the graph.\n\nBy finding the unique path that traverses every edge exactly once, determine the full DNA sequence of the original linear fragment.", "solution": "The problem asks us to reconstruct a DNA sequence from a set of k-mers using a De Bruijn graph. The given set of k-mers with $k=4$ is `{ATGC, TGCG, GCGT, CGTA, GTAC, TACG, ACGT, CGTG}`.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the nodes of the De Bruijn graph.**\nThe nodes are the unique (k-1)-mers, which are 3-mers (trinucleotides). We can find them by listing the prefixes and suffixes of all the given 4-mers.\n\nThe 4-mers are:\n- `ATGC`: prefix `ATG`, suffix `TGC`\n- `TGCG`: prefix `TGC`, suffix `GCG`\n- `GCGT`: prefix `GCG`, suffix `CGT`\n- `CGTA`: prefix `CGT`, suffix `GTA`\n- `GTAC`: prefix `GTA`, suffix `TAC`\n- `TACG`: prefix `TAC`, suffix `ACG`\n- `ACGT`: prefix `ACG`, suffix `CGT`\n- `CGTG`: prefix `CGT`, suffix `GTG`\n\nThe set of all prefixes is `{ATG, TGC, GCG, CGT, GTA, TAC, ACG}`.\nThe set of all suffixes is `{TGC, GCG, CGT, GTA, TAC, ACG, GTG}`.\n\nThe complete set of unique nodes is the union of these two sets:\nNodes = `{ATG, TGC, GCG, CGT, GTA, TAC, ACG, GTG}`.\n\n**Step 2: Construct the directed edges.**\nEach 4-mer corresponds to a directed edge from its prefix node to its suffix node.\n\n- `ATGC` → edge from `ATG` to `TGC`\n- `TGCG` → edge from `TGC` to `GCG`\n- `GCGT` → edge from `GCG` to `CGT`\n- `CGTA` → edge from `CGT` to `GTA`\n- `GTAC` → edge from `GTA` to `TAC`\n- `TACG` → edge from `TAC` to `ACG`\n- `ACGT` → edge from `ACG` to `CGT`\n- `CGTG` → edge from `CGT` to `GTG`\n\n**Step 3: Find the start and end nodes of the Eulerian path.**\nReconstructing the sequence requires finding an Eulerian path, which is a path that visits every edge exactly once. For a directed graph, an Eulerian path exists if and only if the graph is connected and at most one vertex has `out-degree - in-degree = 1`, at most one vertex has `in-degree - out-degree = 1`, and all other vertices have `in-degree = out-degree`.\n\nLet's calculate the in-degree and out-degree for each node:\n- **ATG**: out-degree = 1 (to TGC), in-degree = 0. Difference = +1. This is the starting node.\n- **TGC**: out-degree = 1 (to GCG), in-degree = 1 (from ATG). Difference = 0.\n- **GCG**: out-degree = 1 (to CGT), in-degree = 1 (from TGC). Difference = 0.\n- **CGT**: out-degree = 2 (to GTA, to GTG), in-degree = 2 (from GCG, from ACG). Difference = 0.\n- **GTA**: out-degree = 1 (to TAC), in-degree = 1 (from CGT). Difference = 0.\n- **TAC**: out-degree = 1 (to ACG), in-degree = 1 (from GTA). Difference = 0.\n- **ACG**: out-degree = 1 (to CGT), in-degree = 1 (from TAC). Difference = 0.\n- **GTG**: out-degree = 0, in-degree = 1 (from CGT). Difference = -1. This is the ending node.\n\nThe graph has a single start node (`ATG`) and a single end node (`GTG`), so a unique Eulerian path exists.\n\n**Step 4: Trace the Eulerian path and reconstruct the sequence.**\nThe path starts at the node `ATG`. The sequence begins with the string of the starting node, which is `ATG`. We then append the last character of each subsequent k-mer traversed in the path.\n\n1.  Start at `ATG`. The only outgoing edge corresponds to the k-mer `ATGC`. Sequence so far: `ATGC`. We are now at node `TGC`.\n2.  From `TGC`, the outgoing edge corresponds to `TGCG`. We append the last character, `G`. Sequence: `ATGCG`. We are now at node `GCG`.\n3.  From `GCG`, the outgoing edge corresponds to `GCGT`. We append `T`. Sequence: `ATGCGT`. We are now at node `CGT`.\n4.  From `CGT`, there are two outgoing edges, `CGTA` and `CGTG`. We know `GTG` is the final node in the entire path, so we should not traverse the edge to `GTG` yet, unless it's the only option. Let's take the edge for `CGTA`. We append `A`. Sequence: `ATGCGTA`. We are now at node `GTA`.\n5.  From `GTA`, the outgoing edge corresponds to `GTAC`. Append `C`. Sequence: `ATGCGTAC`. We are now at node `TAC`.\n6.  From `TAC`, the outgoing edge corresponds to `TACG`. Append `G`. Sequence: `ATGCGTACG`. We are now at node `ACG`.\n7.  From `ACG`, the outgoing edge corresponds to `ACGT`. Append `T`. Sequence: `ATGCGTACGT`. This leads us back to node `CGT`.\n8.  We are at `CGT` again. The edge for `CGTA` has been used. The only remaining unused edge from `CGT` is the one for `CGTG`. We traverse this edge. Append `G`. Sequence: `ATGCGTACGTG`. We arrive at the final node `GTG`.\n\nAll 8 edges (k-mers) have been used exactly once. The path starts at `ATG` and ends at `GTG`. The final reconstructed sequence is the string we have built.\n\nFinal Sequence: `ATGCGTACGTG`.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ATGCGTACGTG}$$", "id": "2290987"}, {"introduction": "Once a stretch of DNA is sequenced, the next critical step is annotation—identifying its functional elements, most notably the genes.
