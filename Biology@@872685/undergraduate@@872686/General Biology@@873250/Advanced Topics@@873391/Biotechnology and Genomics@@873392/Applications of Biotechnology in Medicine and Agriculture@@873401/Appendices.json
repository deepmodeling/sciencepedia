While CRISPR systems are famous for gene editing, enzymes like Cas12a have a unique property that makes them exceptional diagnostic tools. This exercise explores how the \"collateral cleavage\" activity of a target-activated Cas12a enzyme can be used to generate a fluorescent signal, turning a molecular detection event into a measurable output. By working through this problem, you will learn how to use kinetic data from a CRISPR-based diagnostic assay to determine the precise concentration of pathogen DNA in a sample [@problem_id:2280007].", "problem": "A researcher is developing a rapid diagnostic test for a bacterial pathogen using the CRISPR-Cas12 system. The assay mixture contains an engineered Cas12a-gRNA (guide Ribonucleic Acid) complex designed to bind specifically to a unique DNA sequence from the pathogen. The mixture also includes a large excess of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) reporter molecule. This reporter consists of a short ssDNA strand with a fluorophore attached to one end and a quencher molecule to the other, such that its fluorescence is suppressed when the strand is intact.\n\nWhen the Cas12a-gRNA complex binds to its target pathogen DNA, it becomes conformationally activated. This activation unleashes a \"collateral cleavage\" activity, where the enzyme begins to indiscriminately cleave any ssDNA molecules in its vicinity, including the reporter molecules. Cleavage of a reporter separates the fluorophore from the quencher, resulting in an increase in fluorescence.\n\nAssume the following conditions and parameters for the experiment:\n1. The binding of the target pathogen DNA to the Cas12a-gRNA complex is instantaneous and complete. The concentration of the target DNA is the sole limiting factor for the formation of activated enzyme complexes.\n2. The initial concentration of the ssDNA reporter molecules, `[Reporter]_0`, is 2.50 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n3. The turnover number for the collateral cleavage activity, `k_cat`, is 1150 s⁻¹. This constant represents the number of reporter molecules cleaved per second by a single activated Cas12a-gRNA-target complex. Assume this rate is constant over the measurement period.\n4. After running the reaction for a time `t` of 90.0 seconds, a fluorescence signal `F(t)` of 1.80 x 10⁴ Relative Fluorescence Units (RFU) is measured.\n5. The maximum possible fluorescence signal, `F_max`, which would be achieved if all reporter molecules were cleaved, is 6.00 x 10⁴ RFU.\n\nCalculate the initial concentration of the pathogen's target DNA in the sample.

Let $[T]_{0}$ be the initial concentration of target DNA, which equals the concentration of activated Cas12a-gRNA-target complexes due to instantaneous and complete binding with target as the sole limiting factor.\n\nEach activated complex cleaves reporters at rate $k_{cat}$, so the concentration of reporters cleaved by time $t$ is $[T]_{0} k_{cat} t$.

The field of synthetic biology is at the forefront of this effort, engineering \"living therapeutics\"—probiotic bacteria programmed to function as smart, microscopic doctors. This practice challenges you to think like a bioengineer, designing a genetic circuit that enables a bacterium to sense the complex microenvironment of a tumor and respond by producing a therapeutic drug only when and where it's needed. Successfully designing this circuit requires a deep understanding of how to logically assemble promoters, genes, and regulatory proteins to execute a precise program [@problem_id:2280020].", "problem": "A research team is developing a novel \"living therapeutic\" for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) using a genetically engineered probiotic strain of *Escherichia coli*. The engineered bacterium is intended to sense a key biomarker of gut inflammation and, in response, produce and secrete a therapeutic protein directly at the site of inflammation.\n\nFor the design of the genetic circuit, the following components are available. All components are to be encoded on a single plasmid.\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n*   **Inflammation Sensor:** Nitric Oxide (NO) is a molecule produced at high concentrations during intestinal inflammation. The bacterial promoter *P_norV* is transcriptionally silent by default but becomes strongly activated in the presence of NO. This activation requires the transcriptional activator protein, NorR.\n*   **Transcriptional Activator:** The protein NorR, encoded by the *norR* gene, binds to *P_norV* and activates transcription only when NO is present.\n*   **Therapeutic Protein:** Human Interleukin-10 (hIL-10), encoded by the *hIL-10* gene, is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that can ameliorate IBD symptoms.\n*   **Pro-inflammatory Cytokine:** Human Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (hTNF-$\\alpha$), encoded by the *hTNF_alpha* gene, is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that exacerbates IBD.\n*   **Secretion System:** To export the therapeutic protein out of the bacterial cell, the Type I Secretion System (T1SS) from an *E. coli* uropathogenic strain will be used. This requires:\n    1.  A C-terminal fusion of the protein to be secreted with the Hemolysin A secretion signal (HlyA_signal). A gene fusion is denoted as `gene-HlyA_signal`.\n    2.  The presence of the T1SS channel proteins, HlyB and HlyD, encoded by the genes *hlyB* and *hlyD*.\n*   **Promoter:** A strong, constitutive promoter, denoted as *P_const*, which ensures continuous gene expression.\n\n**Circuit Notation:**\n\n*   A genetic circuit is described as a series of transcriptional units separated by semicolons (`;`).\n*   Each transcriptional unit is written as `Promoter -> Gene(s)`. For example, `P_const -> norR` means the *norR* gene is expressed from the constitutive promoter *P_const*.\n*   `hlyB + hlyD` indicates that both genes are co-transcribed as an operon.\n\nGiven these components and goals, which of the following plasmid designs represents the most functionally sound and logical approach for the intended living therapeutic?\n\nA. `P_const -> norR ; P_norV -> hIL-10-HlyA_signal ; P_const -> hlyB + hlyD`\n\nB. `P_const -> norR ; P_const -> hIL-10-HlyA_signal ; P_const -> hlyB + hlyD`\n\nC. `P_const -> norR ; P_norV -> hTNF_alpha-HlyA_signal ; P_const -> hlyB + hlyD`\n\nD. `P_norV -> hIL-10-HlyA_signal ; P_const -> hlyB + hlyD`\n\nE. `P_const -> norR ; P_norV -> hIL-10`", "solution": "We identify the design requirements from the stated biological principles:\n1) The inflammation sensor logic requires that the NO-inducible promoter is silent without NO and activates transcription only in the presence of NO when NorR is available. Therefore, NorR must be present in the cell irrespective of NO, implying it should be expressed from a constitutive promoter.\n2) The therapeutic must be produced only at the site of inflammation, so hIL-10 expression should be placed under the NO-inducible promoter rather than a constitutive promoter.\n3) Secretion via T1SS requires both a C-terminal HlyA secretion signal fused to the cargo protein and the constitutive presence of the secretion channel proteins HlyB and HlyD to ensure secretion capacity whenever the cargo is produced.\n4) The design must not exacerbate inflammation; thus, expression of a pro-inflammatory cytokine like hTNF_alpha is contraindicated.\n5) A therapeutic that is intended to act extracellularly must include the secretion signal and the secretion machinery; omitting either compromises function.\n\nEvaluate each option against these requirements:\n- Option A: NorR is expressed constitutively, enabling NO-responsive activation of P_norV; hIL-10 is under P_norV and fused to HlyA_signal, ensuring NO-triggered production and secretion; HlyB and HlyD are constitutively available. This meets all requirements.\n- Option B: hIL-10-HlyA_signal is under a constitutive promoter, which eliminates NO-responsiveness and risks continuous cytokine secretion; this violates requirement 2.\n- Option C: Places the pro-inflammatory hTNF_alpha under the NO-inducible promoter; this contradicts therapeutic goals by potentially worsening inflammation; violates requirement 4.\n- Option D: Lacks constitutive norR expression, so P_norV would not be properly activated by NO; violates requirement 1.\n- Option E: Misses the secretion signal and secretion machinery needed for extracellular delivery; violates requirement 3.\n\nTherefore, only Option A satisfies all logical and functional constraints for the intended living therapeutic design.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2280020"}, {"introduction": "The development of any new technology, especially one involving genetically modified organisms (GMOs), requires a careful assessment of its potential ecological consequences.

These escaped salmon are all homozygous dominant (WW) for the fast-growth allele. They migrate to a river that supports a stable, isolated wild salmon population of 50,000 individuals, all of whom are homozygous recessive (ww).\n\nUpon integrating, the escaped and wild salmon form a single, randomly mating population. The total population size is assumed to remain constant at 51,000 in all subsequent generations due to the carrying capacity of the ecosystem. Ecological studies reveal a critical trade-off associated with the 'W' allele. Although it promotes rapid growth, it also causes pleiotropic effects that reduce viability in the wild environment, such as altered camouflage and less effective predator avoidance behaviors.
