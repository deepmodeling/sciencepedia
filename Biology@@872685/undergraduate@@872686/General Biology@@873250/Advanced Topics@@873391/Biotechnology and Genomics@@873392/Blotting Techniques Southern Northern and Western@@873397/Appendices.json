Her hypothesis is that affected individuals possess a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding this receptor. This type of mutation introduces a premature stop codon, which she predicts would lead to the synthesis of a truncated, and therefore smaller, non-functional protein. She has two cell lines in her lab: a wild-type line expressing the normal, full-length receptor protein, and a patient-derived line suspected to express the truncated version. Her primary goal is to obtain direct experimental evidence that the patient-derived cells are indeed producing a receptor protein that is smaller in size than the one produced by the wild-type cells.\n\nWhich of the following molecular biology techniques would be the most direct and effective method for Dr. Sharma to specifically test her hypothesis about the protein's size?\n\nA. Western Blot\n\nB. Southern Blot\n\nC. Northern Blot\n\nD. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) followed by Sanger Sequencing\n\nE. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)", "solution": "Dr. Sharma’s hypothesis is that a nonsense mutation introduces a premature stop codon in the receptor gene, producing a truncated protein that is smaller than the wild-type full-length receptor. The most direct experimental test is to compare the molecular size of the receptor protein produced in wild-type versus patient-derived cells.\n\nTo directly assess protein size, one must separate proteins based on molecular weight and then specifically detect the receptor. Western blotting accomplishes this by:\n1. Denaturing and resolving cellular proteins by size using SDS-PAGE, where smaller polypeptides migrate further than larger ones.\n2. Transferring proteins to a membrane and probing with an antibody specific to the receptor, ensuring detection is specific to the protein of interest.\n3. Visualizing band positions: a truncated protein will appear as a band at a lower apparent molecular weight compared to the wild-type band, thereby providing direct evidence about protein size.\n\nEvaluation of alternatives:\n- Southern blot analyzes DNA fragments; it cannot provide information about protein size.\n- Northern blot analyzes RNA size; it does not inform on protein size and is confounded by potential nonsense-mediated decay, which may reduce mRNA levels without indicating protein size.\n- PCR followed by Sanger sequencing detects the genetic mutation at the DNA level; while it can confirm a premature stop codon, it does not directly demonstrate whether a truncated protein is produced or its size in cells.\n- ELISA quantifies protein abundance via antibody binding but does not resolve proteins by size and therefore cannot distinguish full-length from truncated forms.\n\nTherefore, Western blot is the most direct and effective method to test the hypothesis about the protein’s size.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2282386"}, {"introduction": "Success in Southern blotting hinges on meticulous experimental design, particularly the choice of restriction enzymes. This exercise puts you in the role of a researcher who must analyze a genomic map to select an enzyme that will cleanly isolate a target gene for detection [@problem_id:2282421]. This skill is crucial for mapping genes, identifying polymorphisms, and verifying genetic constructs.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating a specific gene, designated *Neurogenin-X* (*NGNX*), which is believed to play a role in neural development. The team has successfully mapped a 30 kilobase (kb) contiguous segment of genomic Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that contains the *NGNX* gene. The entire 30 kb segment is represented on a linear map, with coordinates from 0 kb to 30 kb. The *NGNX* gene sequence itself spans the region from coordinate 12.0 kb to 16.5 kb.\n\nTo verify the presence and size of the *NGNX* gene in different tissue samples, the researcher plans to perform a Southern blot analysis. A key component of this technique is a DNA probe, which has been designed to be complementary to a unique 1.0 kb sequence located entirely within the *NGNX* gene, specifically from coordinate 13.5 kb to 14.5 kb.\n\nThe experimental protocol requires digesting the genomic DNA with a restriction enzyme. The ideal enzyme must cut the DNA in such a way that it generates a distinct, single DNA fragment that contains the entire, intact *NGNX* gene. This fragment will then be detected by the probe. The researcher has four purified restriction enzymes available, and their recognition and cut sites along the 30 kb DNA segment have been mapped as follows:\n\n*   **Enzyme A (Eco47I):** Has cut sites at positions 11.5 kb and 17.0 kb.\n*   **Enzyme B (BamH5):** Has a single cut site at position 14.0 kb.\n*   **Enzyme C (Hind21):** Has cut sites at positions 10.0 kb and 15.5 kb.\n*   **Enzyme D (Pst88):** Has cut sites at positions 12.8 kb and 18.2 kb.\n\nBased on the information provided, which of the four enzymes is the most suitable for this Southern blot experiment?\n\nA. Enzyme A (Eco47I)\nB. Enzyme B (BamH5)\nC. Enzyme C (Hind21)\nD. Enzyme D (Pst88)", "solution": "We require a restriction digest that yields a single fragment containing the entire intact gene and therefore also the probe sequence. Let the gene span be the closed interval $[12.0,16.5]$ (in kb), and the probe lie within $[13.5,14.5]$. For a single fragment to contain the intact gene, the chosen enzyme must satisfy:\n- No cut sites in the open interval $(12.0,16.5)$, so that the gene is not split.\n- At least one cut site to the left of $12.0$ and at least one cut site to the right of $16.5$, so the gene is enclosed within a single restriction fragment, which will then include the probe by containment.\n\nEvaluate each enzyme using these criteria:\n\n- Enzyme A: cut sites at $11.5$ and $17.0$. Since $11.5<12.0$ and $17.0>16.5$ with no cut in $(12.0,16.5)$, the middle fragment $[11.5,17.0]$ has length $17.0-11.5=5.5$ kb and contains the entire gene $[12.0,16.5]$ and the probe $[13.5,14.5]$. This satisfies the requirement.\n\n- Enzyme B: single cut at $14.0$. Since $14.0\\in(12.0,16.5)$, the gene is cut into two pieces lying in $[0,14.0]$ and $[14.0,30.0]$, so no single fragment contains the intact gene. Not suitable.\n\n- Enzyme C: cut sites at $10.0$ and $15.5$. Since $15.5\\in(12.0,16.5)$, the gene is cut internally. Not suitable.\n\n- Enzyme D: cut sites at $12.8$ and $18.2$. Since $12.8\\in(12.0,16.5)$, the gene is cut internally. Not suitable.\n\nTherefore, only Enzyme A produces a single, distinct fragment that contains the entire intact gene and the probe sequence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2282421"}, {"introduction": "Blotting techniques often reveal results that are more complex than a single band, providing deep insights into biological regulation. In this scenario, a Western blot shows an unexpected 'ladder' of bands, challenging you to move beyond simple detection and interpret the pattern in the context of post-translational modifications [@problem_id:2282418]. Solving this puzzle demonstrates how blotting can be used to decipher dynamic cellular processes like protein degradation.", "problem": "A cell biology student is investigating a newly identified protein called *Stabilitin,* which has a predicted molecular weight of 60.0 kDa. The student hypothesizes that Stabilitin is targeted for degradation in response to a specific cellular stressor. To test this, they perform a Western blot analysis. Lysates were prepared from a control group of cells and a group of cells exposed to the stressor for one hour. The lysates were separated by Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to a membrane, and probed with a highly specific antibody against Stabilitin.\n\nThe results show a single, sharp band at 60.0 kDa for the control sample. In contrast, the sample from the stressed cells shows a band at 60.0 kDa, along with additional distinct bands at approximately 68.5 kDa, 77.0 kDa, and 85.5 kDa.\n\nFor your reference, the monomeric protein ubiquitin has a molecular weight of approximately 8.5 kDa. The addition of a single phosphate group during phosphorylation adds approximately 80 Da (0.080 kDa) to a protein's mass.\n\nBased on these results, which of the following is the most plausible molecular explanation for the pattern observed in the stressed cells?\n\nA. Stabilitin undergoes extensive proteolytic degradation.\nB. Stabilitin forms stable dimers and trimers.\nC. Stabilitin is multiply phosphorylated.\nD. Stabilitin undergoes polyubiquitination.\nE.

Also, such isoforms would not necessarily be stress-dependent and would not form a ubiquitin-sized ladder.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation is stress-induced polyubiquitination of Stabilitin, yielding a ladder at $M_{0}+nU$ and marking the protein for degradation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2282418"}]}
