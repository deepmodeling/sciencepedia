The target gene fragment has a known length of 1,200 base pairs (bp).\n\nThe experimental setup includes three types of samples:\n1.  **Positive Control:** A reaction containing a purified plasmid known to carry the 1,200 bp target gene.\n2.  **Experimental Samples:** Reactions containing DNA extracted from individual bacterial colonies being screened.\n3.  **Negative Control:** A \"no-template\" reaction containing all the necessary PCR reagents (water, buffer, primers, DNA polymerase, and dNTPs) but with no DNA template intentionally added.\n\nAfter running the PCR and separating the products on an agarose gel, the student observes the following results:\n- The positive control lane shows a clear, bright band at the expected 1,200 bp position.\n- Some experimental sample lanes show a band at 1,200 bp, while others are empty.\n- The negative control lane, which should have been empty, shows a distinct band at the 1,200 bp position, identical in size to the band in the positive control.\n\nGiven this unexpected outcome, what is the most likely explanation for the presence of the 1,200 bp band in the negative control lane?\n\nA. The primers used in the reaction were degraded and did not function correctly.\n\nB. The agarose gel concentration was too low, causing all DNA to migrate incorrectly.\n\nC. The primers annealed to each other, forming a large \"primer-dimer\" concatemer of 1,200 bp.\n\nD. One of the common stock reagents, such as the water or polymerase, was contaminated with template DNA containing the target gene.\n\nE. The DNA polymerase enzyme was hyperactive, leading to non-specific amplification of random DNA sequences.", "solution": "We reason from the experimental observations and standard PCR and gel electrophoresis principles.\n\nFirst, the positive control shows a clear band at 1,200 bp. This demonstrates that the PCR components (primers, polymerase, buffer, dNTPs, cycling conditions) and the gel conditions are capable of producing and resolving the expected product size. Therefore, any hypothesis that would globally disrupt amplification or gel resolution is unlikely.\n\nSecond, some experimental samples show the 1,200 bp band while others are empty. This is consistent with a mixture of colonies where some contain the target insert and others do not, or with variable DNA quality or quantity in colony preps. It reinforces that the assay can detect the target when it is present.\n\nThird, the negative control (no template) shows a distinct 1,200 bp band identical in size to the positive control. In a properly controlled PCR, the negative control should contain no template DNA, so any amplicon in this reaction indicates either contamination with template DNA or an artifact that mimics the expected size.\n\nWe evaluate each option:\n- A (degraded primers): If primers were degraded, amplification would be inefficient or absent across all reactions, including the positive control. The strong, correctly sized band in the positive control contradicts this.\n- B (agarose concentration too low): A suboptimal gel concentration may alter resolution or cause bands to run together, but it would not generate a specific band in a reaction that lacks template. Moreover, the positive control band appears at the expected position, arguing against gross gel problems.\n- C (primer-dimer concatemer at 1,200 bp): Primer-dimers typically produce small products near the bottom of the gel (on the order of two primer lengths, often less than 100–150 bp) and frequently appear as smears or diffuse bands rather than a sharp band that exactly matches the expected 1,200 bp amplicon. Formation of a clean 1,200 bp concatemer precisely matching the target size in the negative control is highly unlikely.\n- D (contaminated common reagent with template DNA): Contamination of shared components such as water, polymerase, or buffer with DNA carrying the target sequence would introduce template into the negative control, producing a band at exactly 1,200 bp. This explanation accounts directly for the presence of an amplicon of the correct size in a no-template reaction and is a well-known cause of false positives in PCR.\n- E (hyperactive polymerase causing non-specific amplification): DNA polymerases require a template to extend primers; they do not amplify random sequences de novo. Non-specific bands, if any, are typically variable in size and conditions-dependent, and would not reliably match the exact expected product size in a no-template control.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation for the 1,200 bp band in the negative control is contamination of a shared reagent with template DNA containing the target gene.\n\nConclusion: D is the best answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2311777"}, {"introduction": "A successful cloning experiment relies on a well-conceived strategy, but crucial details about your DNA sequence can sometimes be overlooked.

The circular plasmid vector, pVEC, is 3000 base pairs (bp) in length and contains a single recognition site for the restriction enzyme EcoRI within its multiple cloning site.\n\nThe student uses Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to amplify the target gene, which results in a linear double-stranded DNA product of 1200 bp. The primers used for the PCR were designed with EcoRI recognition sites at their 5' ends to facilitate directional cloning into the pVEC vector.\n\nUnbeknownst to the student, the DNA sequence of the target gene itself contains a single, naturally occurring EcoRI recognition site. This internal site is located 400 bp from the end of the PCR product corresponding to the forward primer.\n\nThe student proceeds with the experiment:\n1.  The pVEC plasmid and the 1200 bp PCR product are both separately and completely digested with the EcoRI enzyme.\n2.

The ligation mixture is used to transform competent *E. coli* cells, and the cells are plated on a selective medium.\n4.  Plasmids are isolated from several different transformed colonies.

When completely digested with EcoRI, the circular plasmid is linearized, resulting in a single linear DNA fragment of 3000 bp.\n$$ \\text{pVEC (3000 bp, circular)} \\xrightarrow{\\text{EcoRI}} \\text{Linear pVEC (3000 bp)} $$\n\nNext, let's analyze the digestion of the PCR product. The PCR product is a 1200 bp linear DNA fragment. The primers added EcoRI sites at both ends. Additionally, there is a natural, internal EcoRI site 400 bp from one end. Therefore, this linear fragment has three EcoRI sites in total: one at each end, and one internally. Digestion with EcoRI will cut the 1200 bp product at two locations (the internal site and one of the ends doesn't matter, but for calculation, let's consider the internal cuts). The cuts will be at position 0 (start), position 400, and position 1200 (end). This will generate two smaller fragments.\nThe first fragment will have a length of 400 bp (from position 0 to 400).\nThe second fragment will have a length of $1200 \\text{ bp} - 400 \\text{ bp} = 800 \\text{ bp}$ (from position 400 to 1200).\n$$ \\text{PCR product (1200 bp)} \\xrightarrow{\\text{EcoRI}} \\text{Fragment A (400 bp)} + \\text{Fragment B (800 bp)} $$\n\nNow, consider the ligation step.

Several ligation events can occur:\n\n1.  **Vector Self-Ligation:** The 3000 bp linearized vector can ligate back onto itself, re-forming the original 3000 bp circular pVEC plasmid. If a colony contains this plasmid, a subsequent diagnostic digest with EcoRI will linearize it, producing a single band at 3000 bp.\n\n2.  **Ligation of the 400 bp fragment:** The 3000 bp linearized vector can ligate with the 400 bp fragment. This creates a new recombinant plasmid with a total size of $3000 \\text{ bp} + 400 \\text{ bp} = 3400 \\text{ bp}$. This plasmid now contains two EcoRI sites flanking the inserted fragment. If a colony contains this 3400 bp plasmid, a diagnostic digest with EcoRI will cut out the insert from the vector, yielding two bands: one for the vector backbone at 3000 bp and one for the insert at 400 bp.\n\n3.  **Ligation of the 800 bp fragment:** The 3000 bp linearized vector can ligate with the 800 bp fragment. This creates a new recombinant plasmid with a total size of $3000 \\text{ bp} + 800 \\text{ bp} = 3800 \\text{ bp}$. Similar to the case above, this plasmid has two EcoRI sites. If a colony contains this 3800 bp plasmid, a diagnostic digest with EcoRI will release the insert from the vector, yielding two bands: one for the vector backbone at 3000 bp and one for the insert at 800 bp.\n\nThe problem asks for all possible major DNA fragment sizes observed across various lanes of the gel, assuming different colonies (containing the different possible plasmids) are analyzed.\n- From a colony with a self-ligated vector, we see a 3000 bp band.\n- From a colony with the 400 bp insert, we see a 3000 bp band and a 400 bp band.\n- From a colony with the 800 bp insert, we see a 3000 bp band and an 800 bp band.\n\nTherefore, the set of all unique band sizes that could be observed across the different lanes is {3000 bp, 800 bp, 400 bp}.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. 1200, 3000: This would be the result if the internal EcoRI site in the PCR product was ignored.\nB. 400, 800, 3000: This correctly lists all possible fragment sizes from the three types of plasmids (self-ligated, 400 bp insert, and 800 bp insert).\nC. 4200: This would be the size of an undigested plasmid containing the full 1200 bp insert.

However, simple procedural errors can render an entire experiment uninterpretable at this last hurdle.

The student performs a restriction enzyme digest on the resulting recombinant plasmid.

However, the student makes a critical error: they mix their digested DNA sample with pure, deionized water instead of the standard loading buffer, which normally contains glycerol and tracking dyes. They then pipet this mixture into a well of the agarose gel, apply a constant voltage, and run the gel for the standard amount of time.

To solve this, we must understand the function of the components in a standard DNA loading buffer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Composition and Function of DNA Loading Buffer:** A standard loading buffer for agarose gel electrophoresis serves two primary functions, achieved through two main types of components:\n    *   **A Density Agent:** This is typically glycerol or Ficoll. The purpose of this agent is to increase the density of the DNA sample. The agarose gel is submerged in an aqueous running buffer (like TAE or TBE). The DNA sample, which is also in an aqueous solution, has a density very similar to that of the running buffer. Without a density agent, when the sample is pipetted into the well, it will not sink. Instead, it will immediately disperse and diffuse out of the well into the surrounding, much larger volume of running buffer.\n    *   **Tracking Dyes:** These are typically one or more small, colored, and charged molecules (e.g., bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol). These dyes do not stain the DNA itself but migrate through the gel at predictable rates. Their purposes are to (a) provide visual confirmation that the sample has been successfully loaded into the well and (b) allow the researcher to monitor the progress of the electrophoresis run, as the dye front's position gives an approximate indication of the migration of small DNA fragments.\n\n2.  **Identify the Specific Error:** The student omitted the entire loading buffer, mixing their DNA sample with pure water instead. This means both the density agent (glycerol) and the tracking dyes are absent.\n\n3.  **Determine the Critical Consequence:** While the absence of tracking dyes is an inconvenience (the student cannot see where they are loading or how far the run has progressed), the absence of the density agent is a fatal error for the experiment. As explained in step 1, without glycerol, the DNA sample is not dense enough to remain in the well. It will float out and disperse into the electrophoresis buffer.\n\n4.  **Predict the Final Observation:** When the electric field is applied, there will be little to no DNA concentrated within the well to be driven into the gel matrix. The vast majority of the DNA fragments will be floating in the buffer chamber, not migrating through their designated lane. After the run is complete, the gel is stained with a fluorescent dye that binds to DNA. Since there is virtually no DNA in the lane to bind the dye, the lane will appear dark or empty under UV illumination. In a best-case scenario, if a minuscule amount of DNA happened to enter the gel matrix right at the edge of the well before diffusing away, a very faint, diffuse smear of fluorescence might be visible at the very top of the lane, but distinct bands will certainly not be present.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   **A. The lane will appear empty, or at best, show a very faint, diffuse fluorescence near the well.** This matches our prediction. The lack of glycerol causes the sample to float out of the well, leading to a\n        lack of DNA in the lane to be visualized.\n    *   **B. The DNA will be stuck in the well and will not have migrated into the gel, appearing as a single, bright band at the very top of the lane.** This is incorrect. The electric field provides the motive force for DNA migration. The loading buffer does not enable migration; it ensures the sample is in the correct starting position. DNA getting \"stuck\" is usually associated with very large DNA molecules (like uncut plasmids) or contaminants, not the absence of loading buffer.\n    *   **C. Two distinct DNA bands will be visible, but their positions will be incorrect because they migrated significantly faster than expected.** This is incorrect. The loading buffer has a negligible effect on the intrinsic migration speed of DNA fragments, which is primarily determined by their size and the gel concentration/voltage. Furthermore, this option wrongly assumes the DNA would form bands at all.\n    *   **D. The entire gel, including the lane in question, will fluoresce uniformly, making it impossible to distinguish any specific bands.** This is incorrect. This outcome would suggest a problem with the staining procedure itself, such as excessive stain left in the gel, rather than an issue with sample loading.\n    *   **E. Two distinct DNA bands will be visible at their expected sizes, but they will be very blurry and poorly resolved.** This is incorrect. While band smearing can be caused by factors like high salt concentration in the sample or running the gel too fast, the primary consequence of omitting loading buffer is the complete loss of the sample from the well, preventing any bands from forming in the first place.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the outcome is the loss of the sample from the well, resulting in an empty lane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2311813"}]}
