This exercise [@problem_id:2314547] provides a direct, quantitative application of Hamilton's rule, challenging you to calculate the maximum cost an individual can bear for an altruistic act to be evolutionarily favored when multiple types of relatives are involved.", "problem": "A field biologist is studying the social behavior of a species of highly social rodent. In this species, individuals often emit a loud alarm call when a predator is spotted, which alerts their nearby relatives but also increases the caller's own chances of being captured. This trade-off between personal cost and relatives' benefit is a classic example of kin selection.\n\nThe biologist's team has quantified these effects in terms of reproductive fitness units. They observe a specific event where an individual (the caller) gives an alarm call that successfully warns a group of its kin. This group consists of 4 full siblings and 6 first cousins. From extensive population data, it is known that the coefficient of relatedness between full siblings is $r_{\\text{sibling}} = 0.5$, and between first cousins is $r_{\\text{cousin}} = 0.125$.\n\nThe biologist estimates that by being warned, each surviving sibling gains an average fitness benefit of $b_{\\text{sibling}} = 2.0$ units, and each surviving cousin gains an average fitness benefit of $b_{\\text{cousin}} = 1.5$ units. For this altruistic act of giving an alarm call to be evolutionarily favored, the cost to the caller must be less than the total relatedness-weighted benefit to the recipients.\n\nCalculate the maximum possible fitness cost, $C$, that the caller can incur for this specific act to still be favored by natural selection.

These sites confer a significant reproductive advantage, which can be quantified as a fitness payoff. Within this population, two distinct, genetically-determined behavioral strategies for acquiring these sites have been observed: \"Usurper\" and \"Sit-and-Wait\".\n\nA Usurper will always attempt to aggressively take over an occupied nesting site. A Sit-and-Wait individual will never initiate an aggressive encounter but will occupy any suitable vacant site it discovers. The fitness consequences of any given encounter depend on the strategies of the two interacting lizards. The fitness payoffs are defined as follows:\n\n1.  The value of securing a nesting site, $V$, is equivalent to a fitness gain of 60 units.\n2.  When a Usurper encounters a Sit-and-Wait individual at a site, the Usurper always takes the site without a fight.\n3.  When two Sit-and-Wait individuals encounter the same vacant site, they do not fight. Each has an equal probability of claiming the site.\n4.  When two Usurpers encounter each other over a site, they engage in a costly fight. The winner takes the site, but both individuals incur a fitness cost, $C$, of 100 units due to injury and energy expenditure.

But how do animals actually do this? This final practice [@problem_id:2314574] moves from theory to experimental design, challenging you to interpret data to distinguish between two competing hypotheses for kin recognition in salamander larvae. By analyzing the results of a carefully designed experiment, you will determine whether cannibalistic restraint is driven by an innate genetic comparison (\"phenotype matching\") or by learned familiarity (\"environmental association\").", "problem": "In certain populations, the larvae of the tiger salamander (*Ambystoma tigrinum*) exhibit facultative cannibalism. Interestingly, studies have shown that these cannibalistic larvae are significantly less likely to attack and consume their own siblings compared to unrelated individuals. To investigate the mechanism behind this kin recognition, two primary hypotheses have been proposed:\n\n1.  **The Phenotype Matching Hypothesis**: Salamanders possess an innate ability to recognize their kin by comparing the phenotype of other larvae (likely via chemical cues) to their own, a process that does not require prior association. Genetic relatedness is the key factor.\n2.  **The Environmental Association Hypothesis**: Salamanders learn the cues of the individuals they are raised with in their natal pond. They treat familiar individuals as \"kin\" and unfamiliar individuals as \"non-kin,\" regardless of their actual genetic relatedness. Shared environment and familiarity are the key factors.\n\nAn experiment was designed to distinguish between these two hypotheses. Four groups of larvae were established using different combinations of kinship and rearing conditions. After a period of development, a single \"focal\" larva was placed in a tank with a single \"stimulus\" larva, and the rate of cannibalistic attacks over a 24-hour period was recorded. The results are summarized below:\n\n*   **Treatment A**: A focal larva was paired with its sibling. Both were reared in the same tank since hatching. The observed cannibalism rate was 0.19 attacks/day.\n*   **Treatment B**: A focal larva was paired with its sibling. The two were reared in separate, isolated tanks since hatching and had no prior contact. The observed cannibalism rate was 0.22 attacks/day.\n*   **Treatment C**: A focal larva was paired with an unrelated larva. Both were reared in the same tank with other unrelated larvae since hatching. The observed cannibalism rate was 0.78 attacks/day.\n*   **Treatment D**: A focal larva was paired with an unrelated larva. The two were reared in separate, isolated tanks since hatching. The observed cannibalism rate was 0.81 attacks/day.\n\nBased on the results of this experiment, which of the following conclusions is the most strongly supported?\n\nA. The results primarily support the Phenotype Matching Hypothesis.\n\nB. The results primarily support the Environmental Association Hypothesis.\n\nC. The results indicate that both phenotype matching and environmental association contribute equally to kin recognition.\n\nD.
