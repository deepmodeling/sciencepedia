This action alerts other members of its social group but increases the caller's personal probability of being captured.\n\nLet the fitness cost, $C$, to the individual giving the call be defined as $C = 0.05$. The alarm call is heard by a nearby group consisting of four of the caller's full siblings. For each of these four siblings, the warning provides a fitness benefit, $B_{\\text{ind}}$, of $0.10$.\n\nAccording to the principles of kin selection and inclusive fitness, would this altruistic behavior be evolutionarily favored in this specific scenario? Select the option that provides the correct conclusion and reasoning.\n\nA. Yes, because the total benefit to the siblings ($0.40$) is greater than the cost to the caller ($0.05$).\n\nB.

No, because any behavior that incurs a personal fitness cost, however small, will be selected against by natural selection.\n\nD. No, because the fitness benefit to a single sibling ($0.10$) is not large enough to justify the cost to the caller ($0.05$).\n\nE.
