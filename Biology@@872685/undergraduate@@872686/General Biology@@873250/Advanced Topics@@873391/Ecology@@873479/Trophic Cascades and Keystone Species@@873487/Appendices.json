This exercise places you in the role of a modern ecologist replicating this foundational work.

The ecologist hypothesizes that a specific species of predatory crab, *Carcinus vastator*, is a keystone species. The hypothesis posits that *C. vastator*'s predation on a competitively dominant species of mussel, *Mytilus dominus*, is crucial for maintaining biodiversity by preventing the mussel from monopolizing the limited rock-face habitat.\n\nTo test this, the ecologist sets up a number of $1 \\text{ m}^2$ plots. Half of these are designated as control plots, which are left open and accessible to the crabs. The other half are exclusion plots, which are covered by cages with a mesh size that prevents adult *C. vastator* from entering but is large enough to allow free water flow and the passage of planktonic larvae of all species, including the mussels.\n\nAt the beginning of the experiment (time t=0), the ecological conditions in all plots were assessed and found to be statistically similar. The average species richness (the number of distinct species of macroinvertebrates and algae) was 14, and the percentage of rock surface covered by the mussel *Mytilus dominus* was 25%.\n\nAfter 36 months, the plots were surveyed again with the following results:\n- **Control plots (crabs present):** The average species richness was 13, and the average mussel cover was 30%.\n- **Exclusion plots (crabs absent):** The average species richness had fallen to 4, and the average mussel cover had increased to 92%.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following ecological principles is most directly and comprehensively demonstrated by the role of the crab, *Carcinus vastator*, in this ecosystem?\n\nA. Keystone predation\n\nB. Trophic cascade\n\nC. Competitive exclusion\n\nD. Resource partitioning\n\nE. Bottom-up control", "solution": "We begin by identifying the experimental design: two treatments differing only in predator presence. At time $t=0$, both treatments are statistically similar, with species richness equal to $14$ and mussel cover equal to $0.25$. After $36$ months, in the control plots with crabs present, richness is $13$ and mussel cover is $0.30$, i.e., little change. In the exclusion plots without crabs, richness declines to $4$ and mussel cover increases to $0.92$. Because the only systematic difference between treatments is predator access, the observed divergence is attributable to the presence versus absence of the predatory crab.\n\nSpace on rock is a limiting resource in intertidal systems, and the mussel is a competitively dominant space monopolist. The dramatic increase of mussel cover from $0.25$ to $0.92$ in exclusion plots indicates competitive release of the dominant species when the predator is absent. The concomitant collapse of species richness from $14$ to $4$ indicates that most other species are excluded as the mussel monopolizes space. In contrast, where the crab is present, mussel cover remains moderate and species richness remains high, indicating that crab predation limits the dominant competitor and thereby maintains diversity.\n\nThis mechanism matches the definition of keystone predation: a predator disproportionately reduces the abundance of a competitively dominant prey, thereby preventing competitive exclusion and maintaining higher community diversity. The role of the crab directly and comprehensively demonstrates this principle.\n\nWe evaluate alternatives:\n- Trophic cascade (top-down effects propagating across multiple trophic levels) may also occur, but the most direct and comprehensive principle shown here is the predator maintaining diversity by suppressing the dominant competitor, i.e., keystone predation.\n- Competitive exclusion is the process observed within exclusion plots by the mussel excluding others, but the question asks for the principle demonstrated by the role of the crab, which is to prevent that outcome; thus keystone predation is the correct principle.\n- Resource partitioning is not evidenced, as no niche partitioning among coexisting species is demonstrated.\n- Bottom-up control is not supported, as the primary driver is predator presence, indicating top-down control rather than limitation by primary resources.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is keystone predation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1773323"}, {"introduction": "The influence of a keystone predator extends beyond direct consumption; their very presence can create a \"landscape of fear\" that alters prey behavior. This problem [@problem_id:2325175] explores such a non-consumptive, or behaviorally-mediated, trophic cascade.

Ecologists initiate a conservation program by reintroducing the Crested Hawk, a native predator whose primary prey is the Field Vole. After the reintroduction, researchers observe two significant changes: first, the overall population of Field Voles does not decrease dramatically, but their foraging behavior shifts, with the voles now avoiding open fields and staying near the cover of dense shrubs. Second, the population of Sunpetal Clover in the open fields begins to recover and thrive.\n\nGiven this information, which of the following ecological terms most accurately describes the role of the Crested Hawk in this ecosystem?\n\nA.

Ecosystem Engineer", "solution": "We identify the ecological mechanisms at play from the described observations. The reintroduction of the Crested Hawk does not cause a large reduction in the Field Vole population size, but it alters vole foraging behavior: voles avoid open fields and remain near shrubs. This is a nonconsumptive, trait-mediated effect often called a landscape of fear, where predators change prey behavior rather than strongly reducing prey density. As a consequence, the Sunpetal Clover recovers in the open fields that voles now avoid, indicating an indirect positive effect of the predator on the plant via altered herbivory pressure. This is a behaviorally mediated trophic cascade, a form of top-down control.\n\nA keystone species is defined as a species whose impact on community structure and ecosystem processes is disproportionately large relative to its abundance, often via trophic cascades. Keystone predators can drive strong community changes even when prey density does not collapse, particularly through trait-mediated effects that alter prey habitat use and feeding.\n\nWe evaluate alternatives:\n- Indicator species: used to assess environmental conditions; not supported by the scenario.\n- Apex predator: while the hawk may be high on the food chain, the term is less precise about the specific role of driving community structure via a cascade; the defining observation is the cascade effect, not merely trophic position.\n- Foundation species: typically abundant primary producers or habitat-formers (e.g., corals, trees); does not apply.\n- Ecosystem engineer: modifies the physical environment (e.g., beavers); not indicated here.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate ecological term describing the role of the Crested Hawk given the observed behaviorally mediated trophic cascade and disproportionate community effect is keystone species.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2325175"}, {"introduction": "Trophic cascades initiated by keystone predators can have consequences that ripple all the way to fundamental ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling. This advanced exercise challenges you to quantify one such effect, linking the chronic stress experienced by herbivores—the \"ecology of fear\"—to changes in their digestive physiology. By solving this problem [@problem_id:2325135], you will calculate how a predator's presence can create biogeochemical hotspots, demonstrating the profound and often hidden influence of a keystone species.", "problem": "An ecological research team is studying a non-lethal trophic cascade in a montane ecosystem following the reintroduction of a keystone predator. The study focuses on a large herbivore population and how the chronic stress induced by the predator's presence—an effect known as the \"ecology of fear\"—alters landscape-level nutrient cycling.\n\nBefore the predator's reintroduction, the herbivore population, consisting of $N$ individuals, roamed and foraged uniformly across the entire habitat of area $A_{total}$. After reintroduction, the herbivores, to avoid predation, restrict their foraging and resting activities exclusively to dense forested patches, which collectively cover an area $A_{forest}$.\n\nThis chronic stress also impacts the herbivores' physiology. Specifically, it alters their gut microbiome, reducing their digestive efficiency for nitrogen. The baseline digestive efficiency (the fraction of ingested nitrogen that is assimilated by the body) is $\\eta_{base}$ in the absence of the predator. In the presence of the predator, this efficiency drops to a lower value, $\\eta_{stressed}$. The unassimilated nitrogen is excreted back into the environment. Assume that each herbivore's daily intake of plant biomass, $I$, and the nitrogen concentration of this biomass, $C_N$, remain constant regardless of the predator's presence. The population size $N$ is also assumed to be stable over the observation period.\n\nGiven the following parameters:\n- Total habitat area, $A_{total} = 80.0 \\text{ km}^2$\n- Total forested patch area, $A_{forest} = 15.0 \\text{ km}^2$\n- Baseline digestive efficiency, $\\eta_{base} = 0.55$\n- Stressed digestive efficiency, $\\eta_{stressed} = 0.42$\n\nCalculate the ratio of the mean nitrogen deposition rate per unit area (in kg of N per km² per day) within the forested patches *after* predator reintroduction to the rate within those same patches *before* reintroduction. Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let's denote the nitrogen deposition rate per unit area *before* reintroduction as $R_{before}$ and *after* reintroduction as $R_{after}$. The problem asks for the ratio $\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{R_{after}}{R_{before}}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the general formula for the amount of nitrogen excreted by a single herbivore per day.\nThe daily nitrogen intake for one herbivore is the product of its biomass intake and the nitrogen concentration of that biomass: $N_{intake, daily} = I \\cdot C_N$.\nThe amount of nitrogen assimilated by the herbivore is this intake multiplied by the digestive efficiency, $\\eta$: $N_{assimilated, daily} = I \\cdot C_N \\cdot \\eta$.\nThe amount of nitrogen excreted is the difference between intake and assimilation:\n$N_{excreted, daily} = N_{intake, daily} - N_{assimilated, daily} = I \\cdot C_N - I \\cdot C_N \\cdot \\eta = I \\cdot C_N \\cdot (1 - \\eta)$.\n\nThe total nitrogen excreted by the entire population of $N$ herbivores per day is:\n$N_{excreted, total} = N \\cdot I \\cdot C_N \\cdot (1 - \\eta)$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the deposition rate per unit area for the two scenarios.\n\n**Scenario 1: Before Predator Reintroduction**\nIn this state, the herbivores forage uniformly over the entire habitat area, $A_{total}$. The digestive efficiency is the baseline efficiency, $\\eta_{base}$.\nThe total amount of nitrogen excreted per day is:\n$E_{before} = N \\cdot I \\cdot C_N \\cdot (1 - \\eta_{base})$.\nThis amount is distributed evenly over the area $A_{total}$. Therefore, the nitrogen deposition rate per unit area is uniform across the landscape, including within the forested patches.\n$$R_{before} = \\frac{E_{before}}{A_{total}} = \\frac{N \\cdot I \\cdot C_N \\cdot (1 - \\eta_{base})}{A_{total}}$$\n\n**Scenario 2: After Predator Reintroduction**\nIn this state, the herbivores are stressed, so their digestive efficiency drops to $\\eta_{stressed}$. They also confine their activities to the forested patches of area $A_{forest}$.\nThe total amount of nitrogen excreted per day is:\n$E_{after} = N \\cdot I \\cdot C_N \\cdot (1 - \\eta_{stressed})$.\nThis amount is now distributed only over the area $A_{forest}$. Therefore, the nitrogen deposition rate per unit area within these forested patches is:\n$$R_{after} = \\frac{E_{after}}{A_{forest}} = \\frac{N \\cdot I \\cdot C_N \\cdot (1 - \\eta_{stressed})}{A_{forest}}$$\n\n**Calculating the Ratio**\nWe can now compute the desired ratio, $\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{R_{after}}{R_{before}}$.\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\frac{N \\cdot I \\cdot C_N \\cdot (1 - \\eta_{stressed})}{A_{forest}}}{\\frac{N \\cdot I \\cdot C_N \\cdot (1 - \\eta_{base})}{A_{total}}}$$\nThe terms $N$, $I$, and $C_N$ cancel out, simplifying the expression significantly. This shows that the ratio is independent of the herbivore population size, their food intake, and the nitrogen content of their food, as these were assumed constant.\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{1 - \\eta_{stressed}}{1 - \\eta_{base}} \\cdot \\frac{A_{total}}{A_{forest}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this symbolic expression:\n- $A_{total} = 80.0 \\text{ km}^2$\n- $A_{forest} = 15.0 \\text{ km}^2$\n- $\\eta_{base} = 0.55$\n- $\\eta_{stressed} = 0.42$\n\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{1 - 0.42}{1 - 0.55} \\cdot \\frac{80.0}{15.0}$$\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{0.58}{0.45} \\cdot \\frac{80.0}{15.0}$$\n$$\\mathcal{R} \\approx 1.2888... \\cdot 5.3333...$$\n$$\\mathcal{R} \\approx 6.874074...$$\n\nThe problem asks to round the final answer to three significant figures.\nThe fourth significant figure is 4, so we round down.\n$\\mathcal{R} \\approx 6.87$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.87}$$", "id": "2325135"}]}
