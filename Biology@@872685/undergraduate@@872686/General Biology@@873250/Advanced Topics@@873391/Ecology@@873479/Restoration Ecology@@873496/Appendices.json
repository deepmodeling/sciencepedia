The soil is contaminated with a heavy metal at an initial concentration $C_{initial}$. They plan to introduce a target tree species (Species T), which is sensitive to this metal. To aid its establishment, they will first plant a metal-tolerant nurse plant (Species N).\n\nThe nurse plant has a dual effect on the target species. First, it facilitates growth by taking up the metal, reducing the effective concentration in the soil. Second, it competes with the target species for light and water. The ecologists have developed a model for the first-year survival probability, $S_T$, of a newly planted Species T seedling as a function of the planting density of the nurse plant, $N_N$ (in plants per hectare).\n\nThe model is given by:\n$$S_T(N_N) = S_0 \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{C_{eff}}{C_{crit}}\\right) \\cdot \\exp(-\\alpha N_N)$$\n\nWhere:\n- $S_0$ is the baseline survival probability of Species T on uncontaminated soil with no competition.\n- $C_{crit}$ is the critical metal concentration above which no Species T seedlings can survive.\n- $\\alpha$ is a coefficient representing the strength of competition from the nurse plant.\n- $C_{eff}$ is the effective metal concentration experienced by the seedling, which is reduced by the nurse plants according to the linear relationship $C_{eff} = C_{initial} - \\beta N_N$. Here, $\\beta$ is a coefficient representing the ameliorating effect of each nurse plant. This relationship is valid as long as $C_{eff} \\ge 0$.\n\nYour task is to determine the optimal planting density of the nurse plant, $N_N$, that maximizes the first-year survival probability, $S_T$, of the target species.\n\nUse the following parameter values:\n- Initial metal concentration, $C_{initial} = 260 \\text{ mg/kg}$\n- Critical metal concentration for Species T, $C_{crit} = 310 \\text{ mg/kg}$\n- Competition coefficient, $\\alpha = 0.0022 \\text{ hectare/plant}$\n- Amelioration coefficient, $\\beta = 0.35 \\text{ (mg/kg) per (plant/hectare)}$\n- Baseline survival probability, $S_0 = 0.85$\n\nAssuming that the optimal density occurs in a range where $C_{eff} > 0$, calculate the optimal nurse plant density.

This problem focuses on a common restoration goal: the reintroduction of an animal species. It challenges you to think beyond the obvious needs of the adult organism and consider the entire life cycle, revealing that the success or failure of the project can hinge on a single, critical resource required by the most vulnerable life stage [@problem_id:2313266].", "problem": "A conservation team is planning the reintroduction of a species of butterfly, the Silver-spotted Skipper (*Epargyreus clarus*), to a restored meadow habitat. Extensive planting has already been completed, resulting in a high density of flowering plants like clover, thistle, and milkweed, which provide an abundant source of nectar for the adult butterflies. For the reintroduction to be successful and lead to a self-sustaining, long-term population, another key resource must be readily available. Which of the following resources is most critical for the establishment of the Silver-spotted Skipper population, aside from the nectar sources for the adults?\n\nA. Sufficiently dense ground cover to provide overwintering sites for the adult butterflies.\n\nB. The presence of specific host plants, such as Black Locust or other legumes, for the larval stage.\n\nC. A nearby source of open water, such as a pond or stream, for hydration and mineral uptake.\n\nD. A high diversity of predatory insects and birds to maintain a natural ecological balance.", "solution": "We are asked to determine which resource, besides adult nectar sources, is most critical for establishing a self-sustaining population of the Silver-spotted Skipper. The key biological principle is that butterflies are holometabolous insects, with adults and larvae occupying different niches and having different dietary requirements. Population persistence requires successful reproduction, which in turn requires that females locate appropriate host plants for oviposition and that larvae have suitable food for growth and development. In many Lepidoptera, larval host specificity is strong; without the correct host plants, eggs may be laid unsuccessfully or larvae will starve, preventing recruitment into the adult stage and making population establishment impossible despite abundant adult nectar.\n\nFor Epargyreus clarus specifically, the larvae feed on legumes, with known hosts including Black Locust and other leguminous plants. Thus, the presence of specific larval host plants is the most critical additional resource.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is not the key limitation. Silver-spotted Skippers do not overwinter as adults; they overwinter in the immature stage, so dense ground cover for adult overwintering is not the critical factor for establishment compared to larval host availability.\n- Option B correctly identifies the essential larval host plants (e.g., Black Locust and other legumes), which are necessary for successful reproduction and population persistence.\n- Option C is not essential. Butterflies can obtain water and minerals through nectar and puddling behavior; a nearby open water source is not typically a limiting factor for population establishment.\n- Option D is not a resource for the reintroduced species; predation represents top-down pressure and is not required to establish the target population.\n\nTherefore, the most critical resource is the presence of the specific larval host plants.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2313266"}, {"introduction": "How do we know if a restoration project is truly working? This final practice challenges you to think like a field ecologist by designing a monitoring plan to track ecosystem recovery. It moves beyond simple species counts to explore the use of modern, non-invasive tools like passive acoustic monitoring to assess changes in biodiversity. By evaluating different experimental designs, you will learn why including controls and reference sites is essential for drawing scientifically valid conclusions about the success of a restoration effort [@problem_id:2313279].", "problem": "A conservation agency is undertaking a large-scale restoration project in a temperate freshwater marsh. A 50-hectare area, previously a monoculture of the invasive common reed (*Phragmites australis*), has been cleared to encourage the re-establishment of native plant and animal communities. The agency wishes to monitor the success of this restoration over the next five years by quantitatively assessing the recovery of native soniferous (sound-producing) insect and amphibian populations, which are key indicators of wetland health. They will use passive acoustic monitoring, deploying automated sound recorders.\n\nYou are tasked with selecting the most scientifically rigorous and effective monitoring plan from the options below. The ideal plan must be able to distinguish the effects of restoration from natural environmental fluctuations and provide a robust measure of biodiversity change.\n\nWhich of the following monitoring plans is the most appropriate for this objective?\n\nA. Deploy ten acoustic recorders at randomly selected points within the 50-hectare restored area. Program the units to record for five minutes at the top of every hour, 24 hours a day, for the entire five-year period. For analysis, calculate a single site-wide average for the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) for each month, and track this value over time.\n\nB. Establish three treatment types, each with three replicated 10-hectare sites: restored sites, unrestored sites still dominated by *Phragmites*, and pristine reference sites in a nearby conservation area. In each of the nine total sites, place four recorders, stratified by microhabitat (e.g., open water edge, newly vegetated mudflat). Program them to record for 10 minutes at four specific times daily: dawn (capturing the dawn chorus), midday, dusk (capturing crepuscular insects), and midnight (capturing nocturnal amphibians). For analysis, calculate both the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) to estimate vocal richness and the Bioacoustic Index (BI) to assess the relative abundance of biophony, comparing the trends among the three treatment types.\n\nC. Establish two treatment sites: the 50-hectare restored area and an equivalent-sized, pristine reference marsh. In each site, create a 100-meter transect and place an acoustic recorder every 20 meters. Program the units to record for the first 10 minutes of every hour only during daylight hours (sunrise to sunset) from May to August. For analysis, use the Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI) to quantify the level of anthropogenic noise versus biological sound.\n\nD. Deploy one high-sensitivity acoustic recorder in the geometric center of the restored area and one in the center of a nearby unrestored *Phragmites* patch. Program the recorders to operate continuously (24/7) for one week during the peak amphibian breeding season (mid-April) and one week during peak insect activity (mid-July) each year. For analysis, calculate the average Root-Mean-Square (RMS) sound pressure level for each recording week to measure total acoustic energy.\n\nE. Establish two treatment sites: the restored area and an unrestored control area. In each, deploy five acoustic recorders. For the entire five-year period, manually listen to a randomly selected 1% of the recordings from each recorder. Identify every audible species and create a comprehensive species list for each site for each year. Restoration success will be measured by the increase in the number of native species identified in the restored site.", "solution": "Goal: choose the plan that best isolates restoration effects from natural environmental fluctuations and yields a robust quantitative measure of biodiversity change for soniferous insects and amphibians using passive acoustic monitoring. The necessary design principles are: (i) appropriate controls and references sampled concurrently to separate treatment effects from background variability; (ii) replication at the site and within-site levels to estimate variance and avoid pseudoreplication; (iii) stratification across relevant microhabitats to capture spatial heterogeneity; (iv) temporal sampling aligned with diel activity of target taxa and replicated across years to capture seasonal and interannual variability; and (v) use of complementary acoustic indices that reflect vocal activity richness and relative biological acoustic energy rather than undifferentiated sound level, enabling inference about biodiversity rather than just noise.\n\nOption A lacks appropriate controls or references, so any trend in the restored area cannot be distinguished from natural interannual variability, climate anomalies, or regional population cycles. A single monthly site-wide ACI average aggregates across the diel cycle and weather variation, masking informative structure; this promotes pseudoreplication (ten recorders treated as if representing a single site) and reduces power to detect biologically meaningful change in specific taxa (e.g., crepuscular insects or nocturnal amphibians).\n\nOption B establishes three treatment types along a meaningful ecological gradient—restored, unrestored invaded, and pristine reference—each replicated across three independent 10-hectare sites to estimate among-site variance and avoid pseudoreplication. Within each site, four recorders are placed with microhabitat stratification, reducing within-site variance due to habitat heterogeneity and improving detectability across target guilds. Temporal sampling is standardized at four biologically relevant times (dawn, midday, dusk, midnight) that align with peak activity of birds/insects/amphibians, and repeated daily over years, enabling robust repeated-measures comparisons among treatments through time. Use of two complementary indices (ACI reflecting complexity/vocal richness; BI reflecting relative biological acoustic energy) provides a more robust characterization of change in biophony than any single index. Because unrestored invaded and pristine reference sites are monitored concurrently, difference-in-differences style comparisons over the five years can isolate restoration effects from regional environmental fluctuations. Thus, Option B satisfies controls, replication, stratification, temporal coverage, and appropriate metrics.\n\nOption C includes only restored versus pristine, omitting the crucial unrestored invaded control that would attribute changes specifically to restoration rather than to general differences from pristine systems. Its sampling excludes night hours and most of the year, missing peak amphibian choruses and seasonal insect activity, and relies primarily on NDSI, which partitions anthropogenic versus biological sound but is not optimized to quantify biodiversity change in target taxa.\n\nOption D uses only one recorder per site and only two short seasonal windows per year, providing inadequate spatial and temporal replication. RMS sound pressure level measures total acoustic energy and is highly sensitive to abiotic noise (wind, rain) and anthropogenic sounds, with weak linkage to biodiversity or species composition, undermining inference about restoration success.\n\nOption E relies on manual listening to a small random subset of recordings to compile species lists. This approach lacks standardized detectability models, provides presence-only data without abundance or activity proxies, and introduces observer and subsampling biases. It also lacks a pristine reference and microhabitat stratification, and species richness alone is a limited indicator compared to multi-metric acoustic indices.\n\nBy meeting all key design principles—controls plus pristine reference, replication at multiple scales, microhabitat stratification, diel coverage matched to taxa, multi-year repeated measures, and use of relevant bioacoustic indices—Option B is the most scientifically rigorous and effective plan for distinguishing restoration effects from natural variation and quantifying biodiversity change.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2313279"}]}
