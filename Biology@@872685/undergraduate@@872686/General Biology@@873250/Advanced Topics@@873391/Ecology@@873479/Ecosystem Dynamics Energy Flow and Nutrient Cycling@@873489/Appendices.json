This flow is often visualized as a pyramid, with a large energy base at the bottom (producers) and progressively smaller amounts of energy at higher trophic levels. This exercise provides a quantitative look at this principle, allowing you to calculate how much energy, originally captured by phytoplankton, makes its way to secondary consumers based on a specific trophic efficiency [@problem_id:2291633].", "problem": "An ecological research team is modeling the energy flow in a simplified coastal estuary food web. The base of this food web is composed of phytoplankton, which are the primary producers. The team has determined that the net primary productivity (NPP) of the phytoplankton in this ecosystem is 6,250 kilocalories per square meter per year (kcal/(m²·year)).\n\nIn this model, the primary consumers are zooplankton that feed exclusively on the phytoplankton. The secondary consumers are small fish that feed exclusively on the zooplankton. The energy transfer between successive trophic levels, known as trophic efficiency, is assumed to be a constant 14.0% for this particular system.\n\nCalculate the amount of energy that is available to the secondary consumer trophic level (the small fish).

This concept, known as ecological stoichiometry, is crucial for understanding what limits growth in an ecosystem.

Ecologists are tasked with modeling the recovery of soil organic carbon over time after planting the new forest.\n\nThey employ a simplified single-compartment model for the soil organic carbon pool. In this model, the change in soil carbon is determined by two main fluxes: the input of carbon from plant litter (dead leaves, roots, etc.) and the loss of carbon through decomposition by soil microbes, which releases it back to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.\n\nThe model is based on the following assumptions and parameters:\n1.  The newly planted forest is assumed to reach a state of maturity where it contributes a constant rate of carbon to the soil through litterfall. This input rate is denoted by $L$, with a value of $L = 0.450 \\text{ kg C m}^{-2} \\text{yr}^{-1}$.\n2.
