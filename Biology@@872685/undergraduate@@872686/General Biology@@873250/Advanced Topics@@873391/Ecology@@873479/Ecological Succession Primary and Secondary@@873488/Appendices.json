Such high sedge and herb signal with minimal arboreal pollen indicates a cold, open, treeless landscape consistent with tundra-like conditions. This matches stage (B).\n\nZone 2: Spruce (Picea) dominates at approximately 0.60, with sedge reduced to approximately 0.10 and pine at approximately 0.15.

This matches stage (E).\n\nZone 3: Pine (Pinus) dominates at approximately 0.55, with spruce at approximately 0.25 and low sedge (approximately 0.02). This shift to pine dominance reflects an intermediate successional conifer forest replacing earlier spruce stands. This matches stage (C).\n\nZone 4: Oak (Quercus) is high at approximately 0.45 and hickory (Carya) at approximately 0.20, while conifers are much reduced (spruce approximately 0.05, pine approximately 0.15) and ragweed is minimal (approximately 0.02).
