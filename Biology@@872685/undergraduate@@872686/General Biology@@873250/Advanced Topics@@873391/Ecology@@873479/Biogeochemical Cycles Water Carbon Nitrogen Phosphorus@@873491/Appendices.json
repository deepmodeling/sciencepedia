By linking nitrogen isotope data to iron fertilization, nitrogen fixation, and the Redfield ratio, you will quantify how changes in nutrient cycles may have amplified the efficiency of the ocean's biological carbon pump, demonstrating the profound interconnectedness of Earth's systems.

During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), approximately 20,000 years ago, atmospheric carbon dioxide was significantly lower than during the pre-industrial Holocene. One leading hypothesis, the \"iron hypothesis,\" suggests that increased wind-blown dust deposition during the LGM fertilized vast regions of the ocean with iron, a limiting micronutrient for nitrogen-fixing organisms (diazotrophs). This would have stimulated marine productivity and enhanced the biological carbon pump, drawing down atmospheric $CO_2$.\n\nTo test this, scientists analyze chemical proxies in marine sediments. The nitrogen isotope ratio of bulk sediments, a proxy for the average nitrate isotopic composition ($\\delta^{15}\\text{N}$) of the ocean, provides a key constraint. Nitrogen fixation preferentially uses atmospheric $N_2$, which has a $\\delta^{15}\\text{N}$ value near 0‰, inputting isotopically \"light\" nitrogen into the ocean. In contrast, denitrification preferentially removes \"light\" nitrogen, leaving the remaining ocean nitrate pool isotopically \"heavy.\" Therefore, the global average $\\delta^{15}\\text{N}$ of seawater nitrate reflects the balance between these two processes.\n\nConsider a simplified model based on paleo-reconstructions.\n1.
