The studies are conducted in two different, but ecologically identical and isolated, tropical reserves. Both teams use the mark-recapture method.\n\nThe first team (Team A) uses a new technology: a miniature, biocompatible transponder injected under the skin, which is completely invisible and does not affect the frog's behavior or survival.\n- In their initial capture, Team A caught and marked $M_A = 120$ frogs.\n- Two weeks later, they conducted a second capture session, collecting a sample of $C_A = 100$ frogs.\n- Upon scanning, they found that $R_A = 24$ of these frogs were marked.\nThe estimate derived from Team A's study, $N_A$, is considered to be an accurate, unbiased baseline for a population of this type.\n\nThe second team (Team B), lacking the newer technology, uses a traditional method involving a small dab of non-toxic, bright yellow paint on the frogs' backs.\n- In their initial capture, Team B also caught and marked $M_B = 120$ frogs.\n- Two weeks later, they also captured a sample of $C_B = 100$ frogs.\n- However, they discovered that the bright paint made the marked frogs significantly more visible to avian predators. As a result, they found only $R_B = 15$ marked frogs in their second sample.\nThe estimate derived from Team B's study is denoted as $N_B$.\n\nAssuming that all other conditions for the mark-recapture method are perfectly met in both studies, calculate the ratio of the biased population estimate to the unbiased population estimate, $\\frac{N_B}{N_A}$.
