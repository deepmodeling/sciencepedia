The Resource-Ratio Hypothesis provides a powerful framework for predicting the winner by comparing the ratio of available nutrients in the environment to the ratio required by each competing species.

The ecologist focuses on the competition between two dominant species of microalgae: *Acutodesmus aequalis* and *Fragilaria crotonensis*. It is known from laboratory studies that the optimal cellular composition for these species, reflecting their nutrient demand, varies.\n\n- *Acutodesmus aequalis* grows best when its internal molar ratio of Nitrogen to Phosphorus (N:P) is 10:1.\n- *Fragilaria crotonensis* thrives when its internal molar ratio of Nitrogen to Phosphorus (N:P) is 30:1.\n\nChemical analysis of the lake water reveals that the molar ratio of total available dissolved inorganic nitrogen to soluble reactive phosphorus (the nutrient supply ratio) is consistently 5:1.\n\nAssuming that competition for nitrogen and phosphorus is the primary driver of the phytoplankton community structure and that other factors like grazing, temperature, and light are not limiting for either species, which of the following outcomes is most likely?\n\nA. *Acutodesmus aequalis* will competitively exclude *Fragilaria crotonensis*.\n\nB. *Fragilaria crotonensis* will competitively exclude *Acutodesmus aequalis*.\n\nC. The two species will coexist in a stable equilibrium.\n\nD. The outcome cannot be determined without knowing the absolute concentrations of N and P.\n\nE. Both species are equally matched, and the winner will be determined by random chance.", "solution": "This problem can be solved using the principles of the resource-ratio hypothesis, which predicts the outcome of interspecific competition based on resource supply and species' requirements.\n\nFirst, we must identify the limiting nutrient. A nutrient is considered limiting if its availability in the environment, relative to other nutrients, is less than a species' demand for it. We compare the environmental supply ratio to the demand ratio (cellular stoichiometry) for each species.\n\nThe environmental supply ratio is given as N:P = 5:1.\n\nFor *Acutodesmus aequalis*, the demand ratio is N:P = 10:1.\nWe compare the supply ratio to the demand ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{N supply}}{\\text{P supply}} = \\frac{5}{1} < \\frac{10}{1} = \\frac{\\text{N demand}}{\\text{P demand}} $$\nSince the supply ratio of N to P is lower than the demand ratio, *A. aequalis* will exhaust the available nitrogen before it exhausts the available phosphorus. Thus, nitrogen is the limiting nutrient for *A. aequalis*.\n\nFor *Fragilaria crotonensis*, the demand ratio is N:P = 30:1.\nWe again compare the supply ratio to the demand ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{N supply}}{\\text{P supply}} = \\frac{5}{1} < \\frac{30}{1} = \\frac{\\text{N demand}}{\\text{P demand}} $$\nSimilarly, the supply ratio of N to P is much lower than the demand ratio for *F. crotonensis*. This means nitrogen is also the limiting nutrient for *F. crotonensis*.\n\nSince both species are limited by the same resource (nitrogen), the principle of competitive exclusion predicts that one species will outcompete and eliminate the other. The successful competitor will be the species that can survive and grow at the lowest concentration of the limiting resource. In the context of resource ratios, this is the species with the lower requirement for the limiting nutrient relative to the non-limiting nutrient.\n\nWe compare the nitrogen requirements of the two species:\n- *A. aequalis* requires 10 moles of N for every 1 mole of P.\n- *F. crotonensis* requires 30 moles of N for every 1 mole of P.\n\n*Acutodesmus aequalis* has a lower nitrogen demand relative to phosphorus than *Fragilaria crotonensis*. This indicates that *A. aequalis* is a more efficient user of nitrogen and is a superior competitor when nitrogen is the limiting factor. It can sustain growth at lower ambient nitrogen concentrations than *F. crotonensis*.\n\nTherefore, in the nitrogen-limited environment of the lake (N:P supply = 5:1), *Acutodesmus aequalis* is expected to outcompete and eventually exclude *Fragilaria crotonensis*. This corresponds to option A. Option D is incorrect because the ratios are sufficient to determine the limiting nutrient and thus predict the competitive outcome, according to this model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2312945"}, {"introduction": "While resource levels are fundamental, ecologists also model competition by focusing on the net effects species have on each other's populations. The classic Lotka-Volterra model uses competition coefficients, represented by the Greek letter alpha ($\\alpha$), to quantify these interactions, allowing us to predict outcomes without necessarily measuring the resources directly. In this exercise [@problem_id:2312956], you will analyze a competitive interaction between two fungi to see how comparing the strength of intraspecific competition (self-limitation) to interspecific competition (limitation by a competitor) determines whether one species inevitably drives the other to extinction.", "problem": "Two species of symbiotic, wood-decomposing fungi, *Mycena lux* (Species 1) and *Panellus umbra* (Species 2), are competing for a limited substrate within a sealed terrarium. The population dynamics of these two species can be described by a standard competitive interaction model where the effect of one species on the other is quantified by competition coefficients.\n\nThe carrying capacity of the terrarium for *Mycena lux* in the absence of a competitor is $K_1$. The carrying capacity for *Panellus umbra* under similar isolated conditions is $K_2$. The competition coefficient $\\alpha_{12}$ represents the per capita effect of *Panellus umbra* on the growth of *Mycena lux*, while $\\alpha_{21}$ represents the per capita effect of *Mycena lux* on the growth of *Panellus umbra*. For this specific interaction, it has been determined that the carrying capacities are equal for both species, such that $K_1 = K_2 = 5000$ colonies. The competition coefficients are measured to be $\\alpha_{12} = 0.75$ and $\\alpha_{21} = 1.5$. Both species are introduced into the terrarium in small numbers.\n\nAssuming the system is allowed to evolve over a very long time, which of the following describes the most likely stable outcome for the populations of *Mycena lux* ($N_1$) and *Panellus umbra* ($N_2$)?\n\nA. Both species coexist at stable, non-zero population levels.\n\nB. *Mycena lux* outcompetes *Panellus umbra*, leading to $N_1 = 5000$ and $N_2 = 0$.\n\nC. *Panellus umbra* outcompetes *Mycena lux*, leading to $N_1 = 0$ and $N_2 = 5000$.\n\nD.

Then $1-\\alpha_{12}>0$ implies $N_{1}^{*}<0$, and $1-\\alpha_{21}<0$ implies $N_{2}^{*}>0$. Because $N_{1}^{*}$ is negative, there is no feasible coexistence equilibrium in the positive quadrant.\n\nTo determine the stable boundary equilibrium, compare isocline intercepts. Species 1’s isocline intercepts are $(K_{1},0)$ and $(0,K_{1}/\\alpha_{12})$, and species 2’s are $(K_{2}/\\alpha_{21},0)$ and $(0,K_{2})$. With $K_{1}=K_{2}$, $\\alpha_{12}<1$ gives $K_{1}/\\alpha_{12}>K_{1}$, and $\\alpha_{21}>1$ gives $K_{2}/\\alpha_{21}<K_{2}$. Thus species 1’s isocline lies outside species 2’s in both axes directions, which yields competitive exclusion of species 2 by species 1. Therefore the globally stable outcome is $(N_{1},N_{2})=(K_{1},0)$, i.e., $N_{1}=5000$ and $N_{2}=0$.\n\nHence the correct choice is that Mycena lux outcompetes Panellus umbra.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2312956"}, {"introduction": "If competitive exclusion were the only possible outcome, ecosystems would be far less diverse.
