A critical property for a protocell is the ability to maintain an internal environment distinct from the external surroundings, which depends on the selective permeability of its boundary membrane.\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment designed to test this property. A large population of fatty acid vesicles is prepared. Each vesicle consists of a single bilayer membrane of simple fatty acids enclosing an aqueous buffer solution. These vesicles are suspended in a larger volume of the same aqueous buffer.\n\nTwo different small molecules are then added to the external buffer solution:\n1.  **LipoDye (LD):** A small, nonpolar, lipid-soluble fluorescent molecule.\n2.  **¹⁴C-Glucose:** A small, polar molecule of glucose, where one of the carbon atoms is the radioactive isotope Carbon-14.\n\nThe entire suspension is gently mixed and allowed to sit for several hours to approach equilibrium. After this period, the vesicles are separated from the external solution, and the contents of the vesicles' aqueous interior are analyzed for the presence of LD and ¹⁴C-Glucose.\n\nBased on the physiochemical properties of a simple fatty acid bilayer, which of the following outcomes is the most likely result of the analysis?\n\nA. Both the interior of the vesicles and the external solution will contain LD, but ¹⁴C-Glucose will be found almost exclusively in the external solution.\n\nB. The interior of the vesicles will contain significant concentrations of both LD and ¹⁴C-Glucose.\n\nC. Neither LD nor ¹⁴C-Glucose will be found in the interior of the vesicles; both will remain exclusively in the external solution.\n\nD. Both the interior of the vesicles and the external solution will contain ¹⁴C-Glucose, but LD will be found almost exclusively in the external solution.\n\nE. Both LD and ¹⁴C-Glucose will be actively transported out of the vesicles, resulting in lower concentrations inside the vesicles than in the external solution.", "solution": "We identify the governing physical principle for passive permeation across a lipid bilayer as diffusion driven by chemical potential gradients, expressible for an uncharged solute in dilute solution by Fick’s law. The flux across a membrane of area $A$ is\n$$\nJ = P A \\left(C_{\\text{out}} - C_{\\text{in}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere the permeability $P$ is given by the solubility-diffusion model,\n$$\nP = \\frac{K D}{\\Delta x}.\n$$\nHere $K$ is the membrane-water partition coefficient of the solute, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of the solute within the membrane core, and $\\Delta x$ is the membrane thickness. At long times, if $P0$, the system approaches equilibrium where the chemical potentials match across the membrane, and for an ideal dilute solute without binding this yields $C_{\\text{in}} \\to C_{\\text{out}}$.\n\nWe evaluate $P$ for each solute based on physiochemical properties of a simple fatty acid bilayer:\n\n1. For LipoDye (LD), described as small, nonpolar, and lipid-soluble, the partition coefficient into the hydrophobic core of the bilayer is large, $K \\gg 1$. Nonpolarity also supports a relatively large $D$ in the core. Thus $P = \\frac{K D}{\\Delta x}$ is large and $J$ is substantial. Over several hours, LD will cross the membrane repeatedly and approach equilibrium such that the aqueous interior contains LD in concentrations comparable to the exterior (subject to possible additional accumulation within the membrane itself due to $K \\gg 1$, but with a nonzero aqueous population inside). Therefore, LD will be detected within the vesicle interior as well as in the external solution.\n\n2. For $^{14}\\text{C}$-Glucose, the molecule is small but strongly polar and extensively hydrogen-bonded to water, which implies a very small membrane-water partition coefficient, $K \\ll 1$, and thus an extremely small permeability, $P \\approx 0$, through a simple fatty acid bilayer lacking protein channels. In the absence of specific transporters or defects, the flux $J$ is negligible over the experimental time, so $C_{\\text{in}}$ for glucose remains near zero while $C_{\\text{out}}$ remains high. Consequently, $^{14}\\text{C}$-Glucose remains almost exclusively in the external solution.\n\nWe also rule out active transport: simple fatty acid vesicles lack embedded protein machinery and energy transduction systems, so no active transport can occur. Therefore, any redistribution must be by passive processes governed by the permeability $P$ as above.\n\nComparing with the options:\n- A matches the analysis: LD equilibrates across the membrane and is found inside and outside; $^{14}\\text{C}$-Glucose remains almost exclusively outside.\n- B would require high permeability for glucose, which is contrary to $K \\ll 1$.\n- C would require LD not to permeate, contradicting $K \\gg 1$.\n- D inverts the polarity-based expectations and is incorrect.\n- E invokes active transport, which is not available in simple fatty acid vesicles.\n\nHence, the most likely outcome is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2305791"}, {"introduction": "The \"RNA World\" hypothesis posits that RNA was the first self-replicating molecule, but this requires a prebiotic source of its sugar component, ribose.

Consider a simplified model of such a pond where the formose reaction continuously produces various pentose sugars, including ribose and its stereoisomer, arabinose, at an identical and constant rate, $P$. All pentoses in their free form are subject to a first-order degradation process into non-biological tar with a rate constant, $k_{deg}$.\n\nThe pond water contains a constant background concentration of borate ions, $[B]$, which do not react with arabinose.
