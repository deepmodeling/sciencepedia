To begin constructing a phylogenetic tree, the biologist decides to create a character matrix based on five key observable and developmental traits. The presence of a derived trait is coded as '1' and its absence (the ancestral state) is coded as '0'.\n\nThe organisms and traits are defined as follows:\n\n**Organisms:**\n-   **Sponge:** A simple, sessile animal lacking true tissues and organs.\n-   **Jellyfish:** A free-swimming animal with true tissues and radial symmetry.\n-   **Clam:** A bivalve mollusk with bilateral symmetry and a specialized tissue layer called a mantle that secretes its shell.\n-   **Crab:** An arthropod with bilateral symmetry and a hard, chitinous exoskeleton that it molts to grow.\n-   **Sea Star:** An echinoderm that exhibits bilateral symmetry in its larval stage and undergoes deuterostome development.\n\n**Traits (Characters):**\n1.  **True Tissues:** The presence of integrated groups of cells that share a common structure and function, separated by membranous layers.\n2.  **Bilateral Symmetry:** The property of being divisible into symmetrical halves on either side of a unique plane.\n3.  **Chitinous Exoskeleton:** The presence of a hard external skeleton made of chitin.\n4.  **Mantle:** The presence of a significant part of the anatomy of mollusks, a dorsal body wall which covers the visceral mass.\n5.  **Deuterostome Development:** A developmental mode where the first opening in the embryo (the blastopore) becomes the anus.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following matrices correctly represents the character states for these organisms? The rows correspond to the organisms in the order: Sponge, Jellyfish, Clam, Crab, Sea Star. The columns correspond to the traits in the order: True Tissues, Bilateral Symmetry, Chitinous Exoskeleton, Mantle, Deuterostome Development.\n\nA.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nB.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nC.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nD.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$", "solution": "We determine the presence (coded as $1$) or absence (coded as $0$) of each derived trait for each organism in the given row and column order.\n\nFor the sponge: It lacks true tissues, lacks bilateral symmetry, lacks a chitinous exoskeleton, lacks a mantle, and is not a deuterostome. Therefore its row is $(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$.\n\nFor the jellyfish (a cnidarian): It has true tissues, but has radial rather than bilateral symmetry, has no chitinous exoskeleton, no mantle, and is not a deuterostome. Therefore its row is $(1, 0, 0, 0, 0)$.\n\nFor the clam (a mollusk): It has true tissues, bilateral symmetry, no chitinous exoskeleton (its shell is calcium carbonate, not chitin), has a mantle, and is a protostome rather than a deuterostome. Therefore its row is $(1, 1, 0, 1, 0)$.\n\nFor the crab (an arthropod): It has true tissues, bilateral symmetry, a chitinous exoskeleton, no mantle, and is a protostome rather than a deuterostome. Therefore its row is $(1, 1, 1, 0, 0)$.\n\nFor the sea star (an echinoderm): It has true tissues, exhibits bilateral symmetry in the larval stage (hence the trait is present), lacks a chitinous exoskeleton, lacks a mantle, and has deuterostome development. Therefore its row is $(1, 1, 0, 0, 1)$.\n\nCollecting these rows in the specified order (Sponge, Jellyfish, Clam, Crab, Sea Star) and the columns in the specified order (True Tissues, Bilateral Symmetry, Chitinous Exoskeleton, Mantle, Deuterostome Development), the matrix is\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhich matches option B.

For the character where all ingroup taxa share state $1$ and the outgroup is $0$, the minimal length is $1$ on any tree (one change on the ingroup stem).\n\nThe three characters with two $1$s each are:\n- Bioluminescence: $1$ in $\\{G,S\\}$ (favors clade $\\{G,S\\}$).\n- Armored plates: $1$ in $\\{W,T\\}$ (favors clade $\\{W,T\\}$).\n- Acid spit: $1$ in $\\{G,W\\}$ (favors clade $\\{G,W\\}$).\n\nThese three favored splits are mutually incompatible in the sense that no binary tree can simultaneously contain all three; however, a tree can contain the two compatible splits $\\{G,S\\}$ and $\\{W,T\\}$, but then it necessarily excludes $\\{G,W\\}$.

To understand its origins, the biologist has reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships among eight hypothetical insect species based on extensive genetic data. The relationships are described as follows:\n\nThe phylogeny has a single common ancestor for all eight species. This ancestor gave rise to two primary lineages.\n- The first primary lineage leads directly to a single species, *Mantis solus*.\n- The second primary lineage leads to a large clade containing the other seven species.

It subsequently splits into two terminal branches, one leading to *Blatta quies* and the other to *Termes structor*.\n  - The second secondary lineage is the Hymenoptera clade (species related to wasps, bees, and ants). Its most recent common ancestor gave rise to two tertiary lineages.\n    - The first tertiary lineage leads directly to the species *Vespa solitaria*.\n    - The second tertiary lineage contains species related to bees and ants.
