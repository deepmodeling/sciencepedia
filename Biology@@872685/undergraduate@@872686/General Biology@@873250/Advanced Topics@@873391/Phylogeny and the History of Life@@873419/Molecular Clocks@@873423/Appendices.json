This practice [@problem_id:1757769] presents a more realistic and complex scenario where a gene duplication event has occurred. You must use careful evolutionary reasoning to distinguish between divergence times reflecting speciation and those reflecting an ancient duplication, a common and critical task in phylogenetic analysis.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating the evolutionary history of three closely related plant species: Species X, Species Y, and Species Z. It is well-established from fossil records that the lineage leading to Species X diverged from the common ancestor of Species Y and Z approximately 25 million years (Myr) ago. The biologist is studying a family of genes known as \"Growth Factor Receptor\" (GFR). Through sequencing, they identify the following GFR genes in the modern species:\n- Species X contains one copy, which we will call `GFR-X`.\n- Species Y contains one copy, which we will call `GFR-Y`.\n- Species Z contains two distinct copies, which we will call `GFR-Z1` and `GFR-Z2`.\n\nUsing a calibrated molecular clock, the biologist estimates the divergence times between pairs of these genes. The results are as follows:\n1. The divergence between `GFR-Z1` and `GFR-Z2` is estimated to be 18 Myr.\n2. The divergence between `GFR-Y` and `GFR-Z1` is estimated to be 18 Myr.\n3. The divergence between `GFR-Y` and `GFR-Z2` is estimated to be 12 Myr.\n4. The divergence between `GFR-X` and any of the genes in species Y or Z (`GFR-Y`, `GFR-Z1`, `GFR-Z2`) is consistently estimated to be approximately 25 Myr.\n\nBased on this complete set of molecular data, determine the most plausible estimate for the time of the speciation event that separated the lineage of Species Y from the lineage of Species Z. Express your answer in millions of years (Myr).", "solution": "Let $T_{X\\mid(Y,Z)}$ denote the divergence time between the lineage of Species X and the common ancestor of Species Y and Z, $T_{Y\\mid Z}$ the Y–Z speciation time, and $T_{dup}$ the duplication time that produced the two GFR copies now observed in Species Z. The calibrated molecular clock provides:\n$$T_{X\\mid(Y,Z)}=25,$$\n$$T_{Z1,Z2}=18,$$\n$$T_{Y,Z1}=18,$$\n$$T_{Y,Z2}=12,$$\nand $T_{X,Y}\\approx T_{X,Z1}\\approx T_{X,Z2}\\approx 25$, consistent with $T_{X\\mid(Y,Z)}=25$.\n\nKey principles relating gene and species trees under a molecular clock are:\n1) For orthologs (gene copies separated by speciation), the pairwise divergence time equals the speciation time of the corresponding species lineages.\n2) For paralogs (gene copies separated by duplication), the pairwise divergence time equals the duplication time.\n\nFrom $T_{Z1,Z2}=18$, we infer the duplication time\n$$T_{dup}=18.$$\nConsider whether the duplication occurred before or after the Y–Z speciation.\n\nAssume, for contradiction, that duplication occurred after the Y–Z split, i.e., $T_{dup}>0$ with $T_{dup}<T_{Y\\mid Z}$. In that case, both pairs $(Y,Z1)$ and $(Y,Z2)$ would be orthologous and thus satisfy\n$$T_{Y,Z1}=T_{Y,Z2}=T_{Y\\mid Z},$$\nwhich contradicts the observed $T_{Y,Z1}=18$ and $T_{Y,Z2}=12$.\n\nTherefore, the duplication must have occurred before the Y–Z split, so $T_{dup}>T_{Y\\mid Z}$. In this scenario, one Z copy is orthologous to the single Y copy and the other Z copy is paralogous to it. Then we must have\n$$T_{Y,Z_{\\text{orth}}}=T_{Y\\mid Z}, \\quad T_{Y,Z_{\\text{para}}}=T_{dup}.$$\nThe data identify `GFR-Z2` as the ortholog of `GFR-Y`, because $T_{Y,Z2}=12$ is younger than the duplication time, while `GFR-Z1` is paralogous to `GFR-Y`, because $T_{Y,Z1}=18$ equals $T_{dup}$. Hence,\n$$T_{Y\\mid Z}=T_{Y,Z2}=12.$$\n\nThis result is also consistent with $T_{X\\mid(Y,Z)}=25$: Species X diverged from the common ancestor of Y and Z at $25$, the GFR family duplicated within that ancestor at $18$, and then Y and Z speciated at $12$, with Z retaining both duplicates and Y retaining only one.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "1757769"}, {"introduction": "The previous exercises assumed a known substitution rate.
