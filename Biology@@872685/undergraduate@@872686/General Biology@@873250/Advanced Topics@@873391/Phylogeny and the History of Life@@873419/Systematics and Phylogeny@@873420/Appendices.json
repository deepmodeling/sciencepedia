Their phylogenetic relationships are described by the hierarchical list below. The nodes, designated by numbers, represent extinct common ancestors, while the named organisms are extant species.\n\n1.  A primordial ancestor, designated as Node 1, is the root of the entire evolutionary tree.\n2.  Node 1 diverged into two lineages: one leading to the extant species *Cryptopteryx* and the other leading to an ancestral group, Node 2.\n3.  Node 2 diverged, giving rise to the lineage for the extant species *Heliodraco* and another ancestral group, Node 3.\n4.  Node 3 underwent a divergence, splitting into the lineage for the extant species *Umbrafelis* and another ancestral group, Node 4.\n5.  Node 4 is the Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA) for two major clades.\n6.  The first clade descending from Node 4 consists of a single lineage leading to the extant species *Noctiserpens*.\n7.

The other clade proceeds to Node 5, which then splits to Aquaraptor and Node 6, and Node 6 is the MRCA of Silvavolans and Petramimus.\n- Therefore, the lineage of Noctiserpens ascends to Node 4, while the lineage of Silvavolans ascends to Node 6, then Node 5, and then Node 4.\n- Tracing both paths upward from the tips, the first shared node is Node 4.\n\nHence, the MRCA of Noctiserpens and Silvavolans is Node 4, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2316572"}, {"introduction": "Phylogenetic thinking extends beyond species to the genes within their genomes. Gene families often arise from ancient duplication events, creating multiple copies of a gene that then evolve independently through subsequent speciation events. Distinguishing between orthologs (genes separated by speciation) and paralogs (genes separated by duplication) is therefore critical for everything from comparative genomics to understanding protein function. This practice [@problem_id:2316579] challenges you to untangle a history of duplication and speciation to correctly classify homologous genes.", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying a family of fluorescent protein genes in a clade of fictional marine organisms called \"Coralmorphs\". Through genomic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, the following evolutionary history for a gene, initially called `GFPanc`, has been established for three species: *Acropora Solaris*, *Porites Lividus*, and *Favia Stellaris*.\n\n1.  In the single common ancestor of all three species, the ancestral gene `GFPanc` underwent a duplication event, resulting in two distinct gene copies, which are now referred to as the `GFP-A` and `GFP-B` gene families.\n2.  Following this duplication, the ancestral population underwent a speciation event, splitting into two lineages. One lineage eventually evolved into the modern species *Acropora Solaris*. The other lineage became the common ancestor of *Porites Lividus* and *Favia Stellaris*.\n3.  Much later, a final speciation event occurred in the second lineage, causing it to diverge and form the two distinct species, *Porites Lividus* and *Favia Stellaris*.\n\nAs a result, the genome of each modern species contains a descendant of `GFP-A` and a descendant of `GFP-B`. Let's denote the genes as `GFP-A_S` and `GFP-B_S` in *Acropora Solaris*; `GFP-A_L` and `GFP-B_L` in *Porites Lividus*; and `GFP-A_F` and `GFP-B_F` in *Favia Stellaris*.\n\nBased on this evolutionary history, determine the correct homologous relationship (ortholog or paralog) for each of the following three gene pairs.\n\n-   **Pair 1:** The `GFP-A` gene in *Acropora Solaris* (`GFP-A_S`) and the `GFP-A` gene in *Porites Lividus* (`GFP-A_L`).\n-   **Pair 2:** The `GFP-A` gene and the `GFP-B` gene within *Porites Lividus* (`GFP-A_L` and `GFP-B_L`).\n-   **Pair 3:** The `GFP-A` gene in *Acropora Solaris* (`GFP-A_S`) and the `GFP-B` gene in *Favia Stellaris* (`GFP-B_F`).\n\nSelect the option that correctly classifies all three pairs.\n\nA.

Thus, the duplication event predates any speciation.\n- Then, a speciation split produced the Acropora Solaris lineage and the lineage leading to Porites Lividus and Favia Stellaris.\n- Finally, the second lineage split to form Porites Lividus and Favia Stellaris.\n\nFrom this, the event order is: duplication (creating A vs B) occurs before either speciation. Therefore:\n- Any A vs B comparison, regardless of species, traces its most recent common ancestor to the duplication node and is paralogous.\n- Any A vs A (or B vs B) comparison across species, where the divergence is due to the later speciation events, is orthologous.\n\nClassification of pairs:\n- Pair 1: GFP-A_S vs GFP-A_L. These descend from the same A lineage and were separated when the lineage split into Acropora Solaris and the ancestor of Porites Lividus and Favia Stellaris. Their most recent common ancestor is the A copy in that ancestor, and the separating event is speciation. Therefore, Pair 1 is orthologous.\n- Pair 2: GFP-A_L vs GFP-B_L within Porites Lividus. These descend from the duplication that created A and B before any speciation. Their most recent common ancestor is the duplication node. Therefore, Pair 2 is paralogous.\n- Pair 3: GFP-A_S vs GFP-B_F. These belong to different post-duplication lineages (A vs B). Their most recent common ancestor is the duplication event predating speciation.
