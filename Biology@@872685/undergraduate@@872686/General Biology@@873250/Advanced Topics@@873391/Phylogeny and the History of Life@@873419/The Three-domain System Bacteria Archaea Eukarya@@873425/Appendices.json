{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Classifying a newly discovered microorganism is like solving a puzzle with molecular clues. Each fundamental feature of a cell—its structure, its genetic organization, and the very chemistry of its membranes—provides a piece of evidence pointing toward its place in the tree of life. This first practice challenges you to act as a microbial detective, synthesizing a set of key observations to assign a novel organism to its correct domain [@problem_id:2323969].", "problem": "A team of astrobiologists studying a deep-sea hydrothermal vent on Earth, as an analog for potential life on other celestial bodies, has isolated a novel, unicellular microorganism. Through a series of laboratory analyses, they have compiled the following key characteristics:\n\n1.  Genetic material is organized as a single, circular chromosome located in a region of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid, with no surrounding nuclear envelope.\n2.  The cell wall is present but chemical analysis confirms the complete absence of peptidoglycan.\n3.  The plasma membrane is composed of lipids where the hydrocarbon tails are joined to the glycerol backbone by ether linkages.\n4.  Biochemical assays reveal the presence of proteins, structurally similar to eukaryotic histones, that are associated with the organism's DNA.\n\nBased on this collection of evidence, which of the following is the most accurate classification for this newly discovered organism?\n\nA. Bacteria\n\nB. Archaea\n\nC. Eukarya\n\nD. Protista", "solution": "We analyze each provided characteristic and infer the taxonomic domain that uniquely satisfies all observations. First, the presence of a single, circular chromosome localized in a nucleoid without a nuclear envelope indicates a prokaryote, which restricts the classification to Bacteria or Archaea, and excludes Eukarya and thus also Protista (which are eukaryotes and possess a membrane-bound nucleus and typically linear chromosomes). Second, the presence of a cell wall with complete absence of peptidoglycan argues strongly against Bacteria, because bacterial cell walls characteristically contain peptidoglycan; while some bacteria (e.g., Mycoplasma) lack a cell wall entirely, the statement specifies that a cell wall is present but without peptidoglycan, which is consistent with Archaea that possess cell walls composed of pseudopeptidoglycan or an S-layer and not peptidoglycan. Third, the plasma membrane lipids having ether linkages between glycerol and hydrocarbon chains are a hallmark of Archaea; Bacteria and Eukarya instead have ester linkages. Fourth, the presence of histone-like proteins associated with DNA is characteristic of many Archaea, which possess proteins homologous to eukaryotic histones; Bacteria generally do not have true histones, using different DNA-binding proteins instead.\n\nCombining these independent lines of evidence, the organism is most accurately classified as Archaea rather than Bacteria, Eukarya, or Protista.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2323969"}, {"introduction": "Once an organism is identified as a prokaryote, the next step is to distinguish between the two vast domains of Bacteria and Archaea. While some characteristics overlap, others provide the definitive evidence that underpins the three-domain system established by Carl Woese. This exercise shifts the focus from simple identification to scientific strategy, asking you to determine which set of investigations would provide the most conclusive proof of an organism's domain-level identity [@problem_id:2323985].", "problem": "A microbiologist analyzing a water sample from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent discovers a novel, single-celled organism. Preliminary microscopic analysis reveals that the organism lacks a membrane-bound nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles; its genetic material is concentrated in a nucleoid region. Based on this observation, the organism is classified as a prokaryote. To definitively assign the organism to either the domain Bacteria or the domain Archaea, further tests are required. Which of the following sets of investigations would provide the most conclusive evidence for this distinction?\n\nA. Analysis of the organism's cell shape (e.g., spherical, rod-shaped) and a test for its ability to form endospores.\n\nB. Sequencing the gene for the small ribosomal subunit's Ribonucleic Acid (RNA), analyzing the chemical structure of its membrane lipids, and testing for the presence of peptidoglycan in its cell wall.\n\nC. Determining if the organism's primary chromosome is circular or linear and checking for the presence of plasmids.\n\nD. Identifying the organism's metabolic strategy (e.g., chemoautotroph, photoheterotroph) and its optimal growth temperature.", "solution": "We begin with the given observation that the organism is prokaryotic (lacks a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles, has a nucleoid). To distinguish between the domains Bacteria and Archaea, we must rely on features that are diagnostic at the domain level, as established by comparative molecular phylogenetics and fundamental cell envelope chemistry.\n\n1. Domain-level phylogeny is most robustly resolved by sequencing the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (the 16S rRNA gene in prokaryotes). Carl Woese’s classification of the three domains is based on conserved differences in small subunit rRNA sequences. Therefore, sequencing the gene for the small ribosomal subunit RNA provides direct phylogenetic evidence to assign the organism to Bacteria or Archaea.\n\n2. Membrane lipid chemistry differs fundamentally between the two domains:\n   - Bacteria typically possess ester-linked fatty acids attached to glycerol-3-phosphate backbones.\n   - Archaea possess ether-linked isoprenoid chains attached to glycerol-1-phosphate backbones, and can form monolayer tetraether membranes, especially in extremophiles.\n   Thus, analyzing the chemical structure of membrane lipids is a strong diagnostic test.\n\n3. Cell wall composition is distinct:\n   - Bacteria characteristically have peptidoglycan (murein) in their cell walls.\n   - Archaea lack peptidoglycan; some have pseudopeptidoglycan (pseudomurein) or proteinaceous S-layers.\n   Therefore, testing for the presence of peptidoglycan is diagnostic for Bacteria; its absence (with alternative archaeal cell wall components) supports Archaea.\n\n4. Evaluation of the alternatives:\n   - Option A (cell shape and endospores) is not conclusive: cell shape overlaps across both domains, and endospore formation is restricted to certain bacterial lineages; absence of endospores does not imply Archaea, and many bacteria do not form endospores.\n   - Option C (chromosome topology and plasmids) is not conclusive: both domains typically have circular chromosomes; both can have plasmids; there are exceptions (e.g., some bacteria have linear chromosomes), so these traits are not domain-diagnostic.\n   - Option D (metabolic strategy and optimal temperature) is not conclusive: both domains encompass diverse metabolic strategies (including chemoautotrophy and photoheterotrophy in various forms) and a broad range of temperature adaptations, including thermophily and hyperthermophily.\n\n5. Therefore, the most conclusive set of investigations to distinguish Bacteria from Archaea is the combination of small subunit rRNA gene sequencing, membrane lipid chemistry analysis, and peptidoglycan testing, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2323985"}, {"introduction": "The branches on the tree of life are not always neatly separated; they are often interconnected by the transfer of genes between distant relatives. This phenomenon, known as Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT), results in \"mosaic\" genomes, particularly in prokaryotes adapting to extreme environments. This advanced practice delves into a realistic scenario from modern genomics, where you must interpret an organism's chimeric genetic makeup and appreciate how borrowing genes is a powerful evolutionary strategy for colonizing new niches [@problem_id:2323983].", "problem": "A team of microbiologists discovers a novel, unicellular organism, which they name *Cryohydrogena vesicula*, living within hypersaline brine channels in Antarctic sea ice. Initial genomic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of this organism yield two key sets of findings:\n\n1.  The genes responsible for the organism's core information-processing machinery—including DNA replication, transcription, and translation (e.g., genes for DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase subunits, and ribosomal proteins)—show a clear and strong phylogenetic relationship to the Euryarchaeota, a major phylum within the domain Archaea.\n\n2.  A significant portion of the organism's operational genes—specifically those encoding for proteins that manage osmotic stress and synthesize cold-adapted enzymes—do not cluster with known archaeal genes. Instead, they are phylogenetically most similar to genes found in several species of psychrophilic (cold-loving) Bacteria that co-inhabit the same sea-ice environment. These bacterial-like genes are fully integrated into the main chromosome of *Cryohydrogena vesicula*.\n\nBased on this evidence, which of the following statements provide the most scientifically robust interpretations of the evolutionary history and biology of *Cryohydrogena vesicula*? Select all that apply.\n\nA. The organism is an evolutionary intermediate that demonstrates the direct vertical lineage from a common ancestor of Bacteria and Archaea, predating their split.\n\nB. The acquisition of pre-adapted bacterial genes for cold survival via Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) was a key evolutionary event that enabled this archaeon's ancestor to successfully colonize the extreme sea-ice niche.\n\nC. The similarity in operational genes is a classic example of convergent evolution, where the archaeon and the bacteria independently evolved nearly identical gene sequences in response to the same environmental pressures.\n\nD. The findings suggest the archaeal sample was contaminated with bacterial DNA, and the operational genes are not truly part of the *Cryohydrogena vesicula* genome.\n\nE. The organism's chimeric genome, which combines a conserved archaeal core with adaptable bacterial metabolic and environmental-response modules, represents a powerful strategy for rapid adaptation.\n\nF. This pattern indicates that the last archaeal common ancestor possessed these cold-adaptation genes, which were subsequently lost in all other known archaeal lineages except for *Cryohydrogena vesicula*.", "solution": "Goal: Determine which statements are most consistent with the evidence: an archaeal core genome (informational genes) and many operational genes phylogenetically most similar to co-occurring psychrophilic Bacteria, fully integrated into the archaeal chromosome.\n\nStep 1: Interpret the phylogenetic signal of core informational genes.\n- Principle: Informational genes (DNA replication, transcription, translation) are highly conserved within domains and rarely exchanged by HGT (the complexity hypothesis). A strong affiliation of these genes with Euryarchaeota robustly assigns the organism to Archaea, specifically within Euryarchaeota.\n- Conclusion: The organism is archaeal, not a pre-split intermediate between Bacteria and Archaea. Therefore, A is not supported.\n\nStep 2: Interpret the phylogenetic signal of operational genes similar to psychrophilic Bacteria.\n- Principle: Operational genes (metabolism, stress responses) are frequently transferred across lineages and domains by HGT, especially in shared environments where donor and recipient co-occur. When many such genes cluster phylogenetically with cohabiting bacteria, parsimony favors HGT over vertical inheritance.\n- Conclusion: The most robust explanation is cross-domain HGT of adaptive modules from psychrophilic Bacteria to the archaeon. Therefore, B is supported.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate convergent evolution as an alternative.\n- Principle: Convergent evolution can yield similar functions but rarely produces near-identical gene sequences across many loci. Phylogenetic clustering at the sequence level across multiple genes strongly indicates shared ancestry (via transfer), not independent convergence.\n- Conclusion: Convergence is unlikely to explain multiple bacterial-like operational genes with strong sequence similarity. Therefore, C is not supported.\n\nStep 4: Assess the contamination hypothesis.\n- Principle: Evidence of full integration into the main chromosome (e.g., contiguity on long reads, consistent coverage, codon usage amelioration, synteny with archaeal context) argues against contamination. Contaminants typically appear as separate contigs with divergent coverage/GC or lack chromosomal integration signatures.\n- Conclusion: Given explicit integration into the archaeal chromosome, contamination is unlikely. Therefore, D is not supported.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the chimeric genome interpretation.\n- Principle: Many prokaryotes exhibit mosaic genomes: a conserved informational core and a flexible accessory genome enabling ecological adaptation via HGT. Such chimerism can be advantageous for rapid niche adaptation, especially in extreme environments.\n- Conclusion: The described pattern fits a chimeric genome strategy facilitating rapid adaptation. Therefore, E is supported.\n\nStep 6: Assess the ancestral-retention-with-widespread-loss hypothesis.\n- Principle: Parsimony disfavors invoking ancestral possession followed by near-universal loss across Archaea when a simpler explanation (recent HGT from co-occurring psychrophilic Bacteria) exists. Phylogenetic affinity specifically to local bacterial lineages further contradicts deep ancestral retention.\n- Conclusion: Ancestral retention with subsequent loss is not the most parsimonious or supported explanation. Therefore, F is not supported.\n\nFinal selection: B and E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BE}$$", "id": "2323983"}]}
