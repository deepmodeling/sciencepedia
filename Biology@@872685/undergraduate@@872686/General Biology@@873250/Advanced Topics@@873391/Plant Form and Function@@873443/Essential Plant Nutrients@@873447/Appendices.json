Learning to read these signs is a fundamental skill for any botanist, farmer, or gardener. This first exercise challenges you to act as a \"plant doctor,\" using the specific location and pattern of chlorosis (yellowing) to diagnose a nutrient deficiency. Successfully solving this requires applying the crucial concept of nutrient mobility—whether an element can be moved from old tissues to new ones—to pinpoint the problem [@problem_id:2293990].", "problem": "A botanist is conducting a hydroponics experiment to investigate the effects of nutrient deficiencies on a specific crop species. One group of plants is grown in a complete nutrient solution, serving as the control. An experimental group is grown in a solution that is identical to the control except that it completely lacks a single, essential mineral element.\n\nAfter several weeks, the botanist observes that the plants in the experimental group are exhibiting distinct symptoms. The newest, youngest leaves at the top of the plants are showing severe interveinal chlorosis, where the leaf tissue between the veins has turned a pale yellow, but the veins themselves have remained dark green. The older, lower leaves appear relatively healthy.\n\nBased on these specific symptoms (interveinal chlorosis) and their location on the plant (youngest leaves), which of the following essential *micronutrients* is most likely deficient in the experimental solution?\n\nA. Magnesium (Mg)\n\nB. Nitrogen (N)\n\nC. Iron (Fe)\n\nD. Potassium (K)\n\nE. Phosphorus (P)", "solution": "We apply the principle of nutrient mobility within plants: deficiencies of mobile nutrients manifest first in older leaves because the plant can remobilize these elements from older to younger tissues, whereas deficiencies of immobile nutrients appear first in the youngest leaves because they cannot be readily transported from older tissues.\n\nInterveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins with veins remaining green) specifically localized to the youngest leaves is characteristic of a deficiency of an immobile micronutrient. Iron is a classic immobile micronutrient whose deficiency produces interveinal chlorosis in the youngest leaves, with older leaves often remaining relatively unaffected initially.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A. Magnesium: a mobile macronutrient; deficiency causes interveinal chlorosis first in older leaves. Does not match age pattern and is not a micronutrient.\n- B. Nitrogen: a highly mobile macronutrient; deficiency causes generalized chlorosis in older leaves. Does not match symptoms or location and is not a micronutrient.\n- C. Iron: an immobile micronutrient; deficiency causes interveinal chlorosis in the youngest leaves with green veins. Matches both symptom and location and satisfies micronutrient requirement.\n- D. Potassium: a mobile macronutrient; deficiency causes marginal chlorosis/necrosis starting in older leaves. Does not match and is not a micronutrient.\n- E. Phosphorus: a mobile macronutrient; deficiency often causes dark green or purpling of older leaves. Does not match and is not a micronutrient.\n\nTherefore, the most likely deficient micronutrient is iron.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2293990"}, {"introduction": "In plant care, as in many things, more is not always better. While fertilizers provide essential nutrients, an excess can be disastrous, leading to a condition commonly known as \"fertilizer burn.\" This practice moves from visual diagnosis to the underlying biophysical cause, asking you to apply the concept of water potential ($\\Psi$) to explain this phenomenon. By calculating the direction of water movement under osmotic stress, you will gain a deeper, quantitative understanding of how plants interact with their aqueous environment [@problem_id:2293961].", "problem": "In plant biology, water potential ($\\Psi$) is a measure of the potential energy of water, which dictates the direction of water movement. It is the sum of solute potential ($\\Psi_s$) and pressure potential ($\\Psi_p$), such that $\\Psi = \\Psi_s + \\Psi_p$. Solute potential, also known as osmotic potential, is determined by the concentration of dissolved solutes; it is always negative or zero for a solution. Pressure potential is the physical pressure on water; it is typically positive in living plant cells due to turgor but zero in an open container of water. Water always moves from a region of higher (less negative) water potential to a region of lower (more negative) water potential.\n\nA horticulturalist is maintaining tomato plants in a hydroponic system where the roots are bathed in a nutrient solution. Initially, the system is at equilibrium. The root cells of the tomato plants have an internal water potential ($\\Psi_{\\text{root}}$) of $-0.7$ Megapascals (MPa), resulting from a solute potential ($\\Psi_{s,\\text{root}}$) of $-0.9$ MPa and a pressure potential ($\\Psi_{p,\\text{root}}$) of $+0.2$ MPa. The surrounding nutrient solution is at atmospheric pressure and has a water potential that is also $-0.7$ MPa.\n\nThe horticulturalist makes an error and adds an excessive amount of a concentrated, water-soluble fertilizer to the system. This action does not change the pressure potential of the solution (which remains at 0 MPa), but it drastically lowers the solution's solute potential to a new value of $-1.5$ MPa.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate physiological response of the root cells to this change?\n\nA. Water will move from the external solution into the root cells, causing them to become more turgid as their pressure potential increases.\n\nB. The addition of solutes increases the water potential of the external solution, creating a gradient that forces water into the root cells.\n\nC. The water potential of the external solution is now lower than that of the root cells, causing a net movement of water out of the roots and leading to a decrease in the cells' pressure potential.\n\nD. Water will move out of the root cells into the external solution primarily because the pressure potential of the solution has become strongly negative.\n\nE. There will be no net movement of water because the rigid cell walls of the root cells prevent any change in cell volume.", "solution": "Water potential is defined as $\\Psi=\\Psi_{s}+\\Psi_{p}$, and water moves from higher (less negative) $\\Psi$ to lower (more negative) $\\Psi$.

Loss of water from the cells reduces their turgor, so $\\Psi_{p,\\text{root}}$ decreases.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that the external solution now has a lower water potential than the root cells, driving water out of the roots and decreasing the cells’ pressure potential. This corresponds to option C. Options A and B contradict the sign of the water potential change, option D is incorrect because $\\Psi_{p,\\text{ext}}$ remains $0\\,\\text{MPa}$, and option E is incorrect because cell walls do not prevent changes in cell water content or turgor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2293961"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the scale of a single plant to an entire agricultural ecosystem, this final practice places you in the role of an agroecologist. Managing nutrients on a farm involves a critical balance: maximizing crop yield while minimizing environmental impact.
