{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Plants may seem static, but they are constantly sensing and responding to their environment. A classic example is phototropism, the growth of a shoot towards a light source. This exercise lets you step into the shoes of early plant biologists like Charles Darwin to deduce *where* the plant perceives the light, separating the 'eye' of the plant from its 'muscles' [@problem_id:2307937]. By analyzing this foundational experiment, you will practice the critical skill of isolating variables to uncover a fundamental biological mechanism.", "problem": "An experiment is designed to investigate the mechanism of phototropism in young oat seedlings. The coleoptile, which is the protective sheath covering the embryonic shoot, is the subject of the study. Several groups of identical seedlings are prepared and placed in a dark environment, then exposed to a unidirectional light source coming from the right.\n\nThe experimental conditions for one specific group, Group X, are as follows: the very tip of each coleoptile is carefully covered with a small, opaque, light-proof cap that does not inhibit growth. The rest of the coleoptile remains exposed to the unidirectional light.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the growth response of the coleoptiles in Group X after several hours?\n\nA. The coleoptiles will bend towards the light source.\n\nB. The coleoptiles will bend away from the light source.\n\nC. The coleoptiles will grow straight up, showing no bending.\n\nD. The coleoptiles will cease all growth.\n\nE. The coleoptiles will bend towards the light source, but at a much slower rate than an uncovered coleoptile.", "solution": "We begin with the established mechanism of phototropism in coleoptiles as demonstrated by classic experiments (Darwin; Boysen-Jensen): the perception of directional light occurs at the coleoptile tip, where light induces a lateral redistribution of auxin. Auxin is then transported basipetally and accumulates more on the shaded side. In coleoptiles, auxin promotes cell elongation, so the shaded side elongates more than the illuminated side, producing curvature toward the light.\n\nLet $A_{\\text{sh}}$ and $A_{\\text{lit}}$ denote auxin concentrations on the shaded and illuminated sides, respectively. Let the local elongation rate be $g = f(A)$ with $f'(A)>0$ in the physiological range (auxin promotes elongation). The differential growth driving curvature satisfies\n$$\n\\Delta g \\equiv g(A_{\\text{sh}}) - g(A_{\\text{lit}}),\n$$\nand the instantaneous curvature rate satisfies\n$$\n\\frac{d\\kappa}{dt} \\propto \\Delta g.\n$$\nFor an uncovered coleoptile in unilateral light, tip perception produces $A_{\\text{sh}} > A_{\\text{lit}}$, hence $\\Delta g>0$ and the organ bends toward the light.\n\nIn Group X, the tip is covered with an opaque cap that blocks light perception without inhibiting growth. Because the site of perception and the source of lateral auxin redistribution is the tip, blocking light at the tip prevents the light-induced lateral redistribution of auxin. Basipetal transport continues, but remains symmetric with respect to the flanks; thus\n$$\nA_{\\text{sh}} = A_{\\text{lit}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\Delta g = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{d\\kappa}{dt} = 0.\n$$\nTherefore, there is no bending; growth proceeds but remains straight.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because bending toward light requires tip perception, which is blocked.\n- B is incorrect because that would require relatively greater elongation on the illuminated side, which does not occur here.\n- C is correct: no bending, straight growth continues.\n- D is incorrect because growth does not cease; the cap does not inhibit growth.\n- E is incorrect because the response is not merely slower; it is absent (no curvature).\n\nHence, Group X coleoptiles grow straight up with no bending.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2307937"}, {"introduction": "Once scientists knew that signals were being sent within the plant, the next question was: what are these signals? This led to the discovery of plant hormones, chemical messengers that regulate nearly every aspect of growth and development. This practice presents a common scenario in genetics and agronomy—a 'rescue' experiment—where a growth defect is corrected by an external treatment [@problem_id:2307965]. Your task is to identify the specific hormone responsible for stem elongation by linking a clear phenotype to the function of a major hormone class.", "problem": "A team of agronomists is investigating a new cultivar of rice (*Oryza sativa*) that exhibits a pronounced dwarf phenotype, growing to only half the height of the standard, wild-type variety under identical conditions. They hypothesize that this dwarfism is the result of a single-gene mutation that disrupts the synthesis pathway for one specific class of plant hormones. To investigate this, they cultivate several of the dwarf plants in a controlled environment. Once the plants are established, they are divided into groups, and each group is sprayed with a solution containing one of the major plant hormones. After several weeks, the group treated with one particular hormone class shows significant growth, with stem internodes elongating until the plants reach a height comparable to the wild-type variety. All other treated groups remain dwarfed.\n\nBased on this experimental outcome, which of the following hormone classes was most likely used in the successful treatment?\n\nA. Auxins\n\nB. Gibberellins\n\nC. Cytokinins\n\nD. Abscisic Acid\n\nE. Ethylene", "solution": "The observation is that a rice cultivar exhibits a dwarf phenotype at approximately half the height of wild type, and that exogenous application of one specific hormone class restores internode elongation and overall height to wild type. The hypothesis specifies a single-gene mutation disrupting the synthesis pathway of a hormone; if this is correct, applying that hormone should rescue the phenotype by bypassing the biosynthetic block.\n\nGibberellins are the primary plant hormones that promote stem elongation and internode growth. Classic dwarf mutants in several species, including rice, commonly result from mutations in gibberellin biosynthesis genes (for example, mutations in GA20-oxidase in the rice sd1 gene), and exogenous gibberellin application restores normal stem elongation and plant height. This precisely matches the experimental rescue by spraying with one hormone class.\n\nAuxins promote cell elongation and maintain apical dominance, but auxin application typically does not correct dwarfism caused by gibberellin deficiency and is not specifically associated with restoring internode elongation to wild-type stature in GA-deficient mutants. Cytokinins primarily stimulate cell division and shoot branching and delay senescence; they are not the principal drivers of internode elongation to wild-type height. Abscisic acid generally inhibits growth and promotes stress responses, so it would not rescue dwarfism. Ethylene commonly inhibits stem elongation (e.g., triple response) and would not restore height.\n\nTherefore, the hormone class that most likely rescued the dwarf phenotype is gibberellins.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2307965"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple directional growth, plants can perform sophisticated timekeeping, such as measuring the length of day and night to control when they flower. This ability, called photoperiodism, is crucial for reproductive success. This problem challenges you to unravel the logic of the molecular switch that governs this timing in short-day plants [@problem_id:2307933]. By analyzing the effects of brief light flashes during the night, you will discover the elegant, reversible nature of the phytochrome system, a photoreceptor that acts as the plant's internal clock.", "problem": "An agricultural botanist is investigating the flowering mechanism of a particular cultivar of chrysanthemum, which is known to be a Short-Day Plant (SDP). This means it flowers only when the length of the continuous dark period exceeds a specific critical duration. For this cultivar, the critical night length required to initiate flowering is 11 hours.\n\nThe botanist prepares four groups of these plants. All groups are grown under an identical light/dark cycle of 8 hours of light followed by 16 hours of darkness. This cycle should normally induce flowering. The four groups are treated as follows during the middle of the 16-hour dark period:\n\n- **Control Group:** The dark period is left completely uninterrupted.\n- **Group A:** The plants are exposed to a brief, intense flash of red light (wavelength ~660 nm).\n- **Group B:** The plants are exposed to a brief, intense flash of red light, which is immediately followed by a brief, intense flash of far-red light (wavelength ~730 nm).\n- **Group C:** The plants are exposed to a brief, intense flash of far-red light, which is immediately followed by a brief, intense flash of red light.\n\nAssuming the Control Group flowers as expected, which of the experimental groups (A, B, and/or C) will be inhibited from flowering?\n\nA. Group A only\n\nB. Group C only\n\nC. Groups A and B\n\nD. Groups A and C\n\nE. Groups B and C\n\nF. All three groups", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the flowering response in three experimental groups of a Short-Day Plant (SDP) whose long night period is interrupted by different light flashes.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the physiology of Short-Day Plants.**\nA Short-Day Plant, contrary to its name, is more accurately described as a \"long-night plant.\" It flowers when the continuous period of darkness exceeds a certain critical length. In this problem, the critical night length is 11 hours. The experimental setup provides a 16-hour night, which is longer than the critical length, so the control group is expected to flower. The key to photoperiodic timekeeping in plants is a photoreceptor pigment called phytochrome.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the phytochrome system.**\nPhytochrome exists in two interconvertible forms:\n1.  **$P_r$ (Phytochrome red):** This form absorbs red light (around 660 nm).\n2.  **$P_{fr}$ (Phytochrome far-red):** This form absorbs far-red light (around 730 nm).\n\nThe conversion between these forms is central to the mechanism:\n- When $P_r$ absorbs red light, it is converted to $P_{fr}$.\n- When $P_{fr}$ absorbs far-red light, it is converted back to $P_r$.\n- In darkness, $P_{fr}$ slowly and spontaneously reverts to $P_r$.\n\nThe biologically active form of phytochrome that regulates flowering is $P_{fr}$. In Short-Day Plants, a high concentration of $P_{fr}$ *inhibits* flowering. For an SDP to flower, the $P_{fr}$ concentration must drop below a certain threshold, which happens naturally during a long, uninterrupted night as $P_{fr}$ reverts to $P_r$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the effect of the light interruption in each group.**\nThe light interruptions occur in the middle of the 16-hour dark period (at the 8-hour mark). At this point, a significant amount of the $P_{fr}$ accumulated during the preceding light period has already reverted to $P_r$.\n\n- **Control Group:** The 16-hour dark period is uninterrupted. $P_{fr}$ levels continue to fall, dropping below the critical threshold for well over the required duration. This removes the inhibition, and the plant flowers. This confirms our baseline.\n\n- **Group A (Red light flash):** A flash of red light is absorbed by the $P_r$ form, which is abundant after 8 hours of darkness. This converts a large amount of $P_r$ back into $P_{fr}$. The concentration of the inhibitory $P_{fr}$ form is suddenly raised, effectively \"breaking\" the long night into two 8-hour dark periods. Since neither 8-hour period is longer than the 11-hour critical night length, the condition for flowering is not met. Therefore, flowering is inhibited in Group A.\n\n- **Group B (Red light flash followed by Far-red light flash):** The initial red light flash converts $P_r$ to $P_{fr}$, as in Group A. However, the immediate subsequent flash of far-red light is absorbed by this newly formed $P_{fr}$, converting it straight back to $P_r$. The effect of the red light is almost instantly reversed. The plant's phytochrome system is returned to a state with low $P_{fr}$, as if the interruption never occurred. The plant continues to experience a long, continuous night. Therefore, flowering is induced (not inhibited) in Group B.\n\n- **Group C (Far-red light flash followed by Red light flash):** The initial flash is far-red light. After 8 hours of darkness, most of the phytochrome is already in the $P_r$ form, so there is very little $P_{fr}$ to absorb the far-red light. This flash has a negligible effect. The subsequent flash of red light, however, is absorbed by the abundant $P_r$, converting it to $P_{fr}$. This raises the $P_{fr}$ concentration and breaks the long night, just as the single red flash did in Group A. The condition for flowering is not met. Therefore, flowering is inhibited in Group C.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude which groups are inhibited.**\nBased on the analysis, both Group A and Group C will be inhibited from flowering because in both cases, the final light exposure is red light, which leads to a high concentration of the inhibitory $P_{fr}$ form. Group B will flower because the final far-red flash reverses the effect of the red light.\n\nTherefore, the experimental groups that will be inhibited from flowering are A and C. This corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2307933"}]}
