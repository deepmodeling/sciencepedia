This skill is essential for tracing genetic information through generations.", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the life cycle of a rare species of flowering plant (an angiosperm). Through microscopic examination of root tip cells undergoing mitosis, the ecologist determines that the diploid chromosome number for this species' sporophyte is $2n=54$. The plant follows a typical alternation of generations with double fertilization. What are the respective chromosome numbers for a cell in the mature male gametophyte (the pollen grain), a cell in the seed coat (which develops from the maternal ovule's integuments), and a cell in the nutritive endosperm tissue within the seed?\n\nSelect the correct list of chromosome numbers corresponding to the pollen grain, seed coat, and endosperm, in that order.\n\nA. 27, 27, 54\n\nB. 54, 27, 81\n\nC. 27, 54, 54\n\nD. 27, 54, 81\n\nE. 54, 54, 108", "solution": "The sporophyte of the angiosperm has diploid chromosome number $2n=54$. Therefore the haploid number is obtained by dividing by $2$, giving $n=\\frac{2n}{2}=27$.\n\nA mature male gametophyte (pollen grain) is produced by meiosis and is haploid, so any cell in the pollen grain has $n$ chromosomes, which here is $n=27$.\n\nThe seed coat develops from the maternal ovule integuments, which are part of the maternal sporophyte. Sporophytic tissues are diploid, so seed coat cells have $2n$ chromosomes, which here is $2n=54$.\n\nIn angiosperms, double fertilization yields a diploid zygote (from egg $n$ plus sperm $n$) and a triploid endosperm (from fusion of a sperm $n$ with two haploid polar nuclei $n+n$). Thus endosperm is triploid with $3n$ chromosomes, which here is $3n=81$.\n\nTherefore, the chromosome numbers for pollen grain, seed coat, and endosperm are $27$, $54$, and $81$, respectively, corresponding to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1753286"}, {"introduction": "Building upon basic ploidy, this problem integrates Mendelian genetics into the alternation of generations. You will explore how alleles on homologous chromosomes in a diploid sporophyte are segregated during meiosis. Understanding this process is crucial for predicting the genetic makeup of the resulting haploid gametophytes, which is the first step in tracking traits from one generation to the next.", "problem": "A plant biologist is studying the genetics of a newly discovered ornamental angiosperm. The plant's flower color is determined by a single gene with two alleles: a dominant allele ($P$) for purple flowers and a recessive allele ($p$) for white flowers.

In angiosperms, this mature plant represents the diploid sporophyte generation.\n\nThis sporophyte produces microspores within its anthers, which will subsequently develop into male gametophytes (pollen grains).

In angiosperms, microspores are the haploid products of meiosis of diploid microsporocytes (microspore mother cells) in the anthers.\n\nBy Mendel’s law of segregation, during meiosis I the homologous chromosomes carrying the $P$ and $p$ alleles separate into different daughter cells. Meiosis II then separates sister chromatids, yielding haploid products. Therefore, each resulting microspore (haploid, $n$) contains exactly one allele at this locus: either $P$ or $p$.\n\nAssuming no meiotic errors or segregation distortion, the two allele types occur with equal frequency, so each microspore carries $P$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ or $p$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.

The key principles are:\n- Meiosis halves the ploidy of the sporophyte to form gametes.\n- Each polar nucleus in the central cell has the same ploidy as the egg (i.e., the female gametic ploidy).\n- The endosperm ploidy equals the sum of the two maternal polar nuclei plus one paternal sperm nucleus.\n\nGiven that the branch is tetraploid, all sporophytic tissues of the flower are $4n$.
