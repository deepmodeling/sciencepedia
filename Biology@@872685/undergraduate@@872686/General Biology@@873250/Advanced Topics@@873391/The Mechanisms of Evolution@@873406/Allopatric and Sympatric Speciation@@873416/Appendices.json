{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The first step in mastering the concept of speciation is to grasp the fundamental role of geography in the process. This exercise presents two classic, contrasting scenarios that are central to understanding the distinction between allopatric and sympatric speciation. By analyzing the divergent evolutionary paths of the salamander and grass populations, you will practice applying the core definitions that form the bedrock of speciation theory [@problem_id:1487844].", "problem": "An ecologist is studying two distinct cases of speciation.\n\nCase 1: A contiguous population of fire-bellied salamanders inhabits a large, humid valley. Over a period of several million years, significant tectonic uplift leads to the formation of a high, arid mountain range that bisects the valley, creating two geographically isolated habitats. The salamanders cannot cross this new mountain barrier. Consequently, the two separated salamander populations cease to interbreed and begin to accumulate distinct genetic differences, eventually becoming separate species.\n\nCase 2: In a single, large meadow, a species of grass, *Poa annua*, reproduces sexually. A rare error in meiosis within one plant results in the production of diploid (2n) gametes instead of the usual haploid (n) gametes. Self-fertilization of this plant leads to a tetraploid (4n) offspring. This new tetraploid plant is healthy and fertile, but when it is back-crossed with the original diploid (2n) parent population, the resulting triploid (3n) offspring are sterile. This effectively establishes a new, reproductively isolated population of tetraploid grasses within the same meadow as the original diploid population.\n\nBased on these two cases, which of the following correctly classifies the primary mode of speciation for the salamanders and the grass, respectively?\n\nA. Sympatric speciation; Allopatric speciation\n\nB. Allopatric speciation; Sympatric speciation\n\nC. Sympatric speciation; Sympatric speciation\n\nD. Allopatric speciation; Allopatric speciation\n\nE. Parapatric speciation; Peripatric speciation", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must first understand the definitions of the primary modes of speciation, particularly allopatric and sympatric speciation.\n\nAllopatric speciation occurs when a population is divided by a geographic barrier, leading to reproductive isolation. The term \"allopatric\" is derived from Greek roots meaning \"other fatherland,\" referring to the populations occupying different geographic areas. Gene flow between the separated populations is prevented, allowing them to diverge independently through processes like natural selection, genetic drift, and mutation.\n\nSympatric speciation occurs when a new species evolves from a single ancestral species while both continue to inhabit the same geographic region. The term \"sympatric\" means \"same fatherland.\" In this case, reproductive isolation arises not from a physical barrier but from other mechanisms, such as polyploidy (changes in chromosome number), habitat differentiation, or sexual selection.\n\nNow, let's analyze the two cases provided in the problem.\n\nCase 1 involves the salamander population. The key event is the formation of a mountain range that physically separates the original population into two. This mountain range acts as a geographic barrier, preventing interbreeding (gene flow) between the two groups. Over time, this isolation leads to genetic divergence and the formation of new species. This scenario is a classic example of allopatric speciation.\n\nCase 2 involves the grass species *Poa annua*. A new type of grass (tetraploid, 4n) arises from the original population (diploid, 2n) within the same meadow. The critical point is that this new tetraploid plant is reproductively isolated from its diploid ancestors because their hybrid offspring (triploid, 3n) are sterile. This reproductive barrier arises from a genetic event (polyploidy) and not from geographic separation. Since the new species arose within the same geographic area as the parent species, this is a clear example of sympatric speciation.\n\nTherefore, the speciation in the salamanders is allopatric, and the speciation in the grass is sympatric. Matching this conclusion with the given options:\n- A. Sympatric speciation; Allopatric speciation (Incorrect)\n- B. Allopatric speciation; Sympatric speciation (Correct)\n- C. Sympatric speciation; Sympatric speciation (Incorrect)\n- D. Allopatric speciation; Allopatric speciation (Incorrect)\n- E. Parapatric and Peripatric are other modes of speciation but do not fit the classic descriptions provided in the problem. Parapatric involves adjacent populations with some gene flow, and peripatric is a form of allopatric where a small peripheral population becomes isolated. Neither perfectly describes the scenarios as well as allopatric and sympatric do. (Incorrect)\n\nThe correct classification is allopatric speciation for the salamanders and sympatric speciation for the grass.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1487844"}, {"introduction": "While geographic barriers or large-scale genetic events like polyploidy are clear drivers of speciation, many new species arise through more subtle ecological mechanisms within a shared habitat. This practice explores a common pathway to sympatric speciation driven by a shift in resource use. The hypothetical scenario of moths adapting to a new host plant demonstrates how ecological specialization can naturally lead to reproductive isolation, even when individuals are not physically separated [@problem_id:1754110].", "problem": "An ecologist is studying a species of moth, *Lunamorpha campestris*, in a large, continuous meadow. Historically, these moths have exclusively fed upon and laid their eggs on the native plant, Blue-Mist Flower (*Conoclinium coelestinum*). Ten years ago, a closely related, non-native plant, the Scarlet Sage (*Salvia coccinea*), was introduced and has since become widespread throughout the same meadow.\n\nRecent field and genetic studies by the ecologist have revealed two distinct subpopulations of *Lunamorpha campestris* within the meadow. One subpopulation continues to use the native Blue-Mist Flower exclusively. The second subpopulation has adapted to use the introduced Scarlet Sage as its sole host plant for feeding and reproduction. Genetic analysis shows significant allele frequency differences between the two subpopulations, particularly in genes related to chemosensory reception (host plant detection) and developmental timing. Mating is strongly assortative, as the moths tend to mate on their specific host plant, and the two host plants have slightly different flowering seasons, leading to temporal separation in the moths' peak reproductive activity. Despite living in the same meadow and having the physical ability to fly between any of the plants, gene flow between the two subpopulations is found to be extremely low.\n\nBased on this evidence, which of the following modes of speciation is most likely occurring in *Lunamorpha campestris*?\n\nA. Allopatric speciation\n\nB. Sympatric speciation\n\nC. Peripatric speciation\n\nD. Parapatric speciation\n\nE. Phyletic gradualism\n\nF. Punctuated equilibrium", "solution": "Identify the geographical context: both subpopulations occur within the same continuous meadow and individuals can physically move between host plants, so there is no extrinsic geographic barrier separating them.\n\nEvaluate reproductive isolation mechanisms: mating is strongly assortative because moths mate on their specific host plants, which function as microhabitats. Additionally, the host plants have slightly different flowering seasons, producing temporal separation in peak reproductive activity. These are prezygotic isolating mechanisms (habitat isolation and temporal isolation) arising within the same geographic area.\n\nAssess genetic divergence in relevant traits: allele frequency differences are concentrated in genes for chemosensory reception (host recognition) and developmental timing, matching the observed ecological and temporal isolating mechanisms. Extremely low gene flow despite sympatry indicates incipient reproductive isolation maintained by selection against migrants and/or hybrids and by assortative mating.\n\nCompare to modes of speciation:\n- Allopatric speciation requires a geographic barrier, which is absent here.\n- Peripatric speciation involves a small peripheral isolate (founder effect), not indicated here.\n- Parapatric speciation involves adjacent but environmentally different regions with a contact zone; here, the two host plants are interspersed within the same area and individuals can freely move, so the setting is not parapatric.\n- Sympatric speciation occurs within the same geographic area, often driven by host shifts and assortative mating by habitat and timing; this matches the evidence (classic host-race formation as seen in many phytophagous insects).\n- Phyletic gradualism and punctuated equilibrium describe tempos and patterns of evolutionary change, not spatial modes of speciation, and do not directly address the observed bifurcation into two host-associated lineages.\n\nTherefore, the most likely mode is sympatric speciation driven by host shift with assortative mating and temporal isolation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1754110"}, {"introduction": "Evolutionary theory is not only a descriptive framework but also a predictive science that can be tested with data. This exercise advances from identifying modes of speciation to quantitatively analyzing their consequences. Here, we explore the phenomenon of character displacement, an evolutionary response that can occur when two partially diverged populations come back into contact and produce low-fitness hybrids. By calculating a simple index from ecological data, you can practice how scientists measure the strength of this evolutionary response [@problem_id:2276828].", "problem": "Two closely related species of newts, *Triturus vividus* and *Triturus umbra*, have distributions that were once geographically separated (allopatric) but now overlap in a narrow region of secondary contact (sympatry). In this sympatric zone, interspecific breeding occurs. However, the resulting hybrid offspring are viable but produce non-functional gametes, leading to zero reproductive fitness for the hybrids. This creates selective pressure against hybridization.\n\nA group of evolutionary biologists hypothesizes that this pressure has led to reproductive character displacement, specifically in the coloration of the male tail fin, which is a key trait in female mate choice. To test this, they collected data on the peak reflectance wavelength of the tail fin from male newts in three distinct zones: an allopatric zone for *T. vividus*, an allopatric zone for *T. umbra*, and the sympatric zone where both species are found.\n\nThe collected data are summarized as follows:\n- **Allopatric *T. vividus***: Mean peak wavelength $\\mu_{V,A} = 480$ nm; Standard Deviation $\\sigma_{V,A} = 12$ nm.\n- **Allopatric *T. umbra***: Mean peak wavelength $\\mu_{U,A} = 590$ nm; Standard Deviation $\\sigma_{U,A} = 15$ nm.\n- **Sympatric *T. vividus***: Mean peak wavelength $\\mu_{V,S} = 465$ nm; Standard Deviation $\\sigma_{V,S} = 11$ nm.\n- **Sympatric *T. umbra***: Mean peak wavelength $\\mu_{U,S} = 610$ nm; Standard Deviation $\\sigma_{U,S} = 14$ nm.\n\nTo quantify the degree of character displacement, the researchers define a Character Displacement Index (CDI) as the ratio of the magnitude of divergence in the sympatric zone to the magnitude of divergence in the allopatric zones. The formula is given by:\n$$\nCDI = \\frac{|\\mu_{V,S} - \\mu_{U,S}|}{|\\mu_{V,A} - \\mu_{U,A}|}\n$$\nA value of CDI greater than 1 suggests that character displacement is occurring.\n\nUsing the provided data, calculate the Character Displacement Index for the male tail fin coloration.
