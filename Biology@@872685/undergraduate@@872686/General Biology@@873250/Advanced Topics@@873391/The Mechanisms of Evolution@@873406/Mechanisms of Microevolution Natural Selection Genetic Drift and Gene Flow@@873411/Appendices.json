This exercise provides a concrete, quantitative look at this phenomenon.

There are two alleles for this gene: a dominant allele `B`, which produces black scales, and a recessive allele `b`, which produces brown scales. In the mainland population, the frequency of the allele `B` is $p = 0.8$.\n\nFollowing a severe storm, a small group of 5 lizards is swept away and colonizes a remote, previously uninhabited island. You may assume this group of 5 lizards constitutes a random sample from the large mainland population. This founding event establishes a new, isolated island population.\n\nCalculate the probability that the recessive allele `b` is completely absent in the founding group of 5 lizards.

This is equivalent to calculating the probability that all 5 lizards in the founding group are homozygous dominant, having the genotype `BB`.\n\nFirst, we must determine the frequency of the `BB` genotype in the source mainland population. The problem states that the mainland population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We are given the frequency of the dominant allele `B`, which is $p = 0.8$. The frequency of the recessive allele `b` is $q$. Since there are only two alleles, their frequencies must sum to 1.\n$$q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$$\n\nAccording to the Hardy-Weinberg principle, the frequencies of the three genotypes (`BB`, `Bb`, and `bb`) in a population at equilibrium are given by $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2$, respectively. We are interested in the frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype, `BB`.\n$$\\text{Frequency of } BB = p^2$$\nSubstituting the given value of $p$:\n$$\\text{Frequency of } BB = (0.8)^2 = 0.64$$\nThis frequency represents the probability of randomly selecting a single lizard with the `BB` genotype from the mainland population.\n\nThe founding group consists of 5 lizards, and we are told to assume they are a random sample. The selection of each lizard is an independent event. Therefore, the probability that all 5 lizards chosen for the founding group have the `BB` genotype is the product of the individual probabilities.\n$$P(\\text{all 5 are } BB) = (P(\\text{one lizard is } BB))^5$$\nSubstituting the calculated probability for a single lizard:\n$$P(\\text{all 5 are } BB) = (0.64)^5$$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$P(\\text{all 5 are } BB) = 0.64 \\times 0.64 \\times 0.64 \\times 0.64 \\times 0.64 = 0.1073741824$$\n\nFinally, the problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$0.1073741824 \\approx 0.1074$$\n\nThus, the probability that the recessive allele `b` is completely absent from the new founding population is 0.1074.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1074}$$", "id": "2302261"}, {"introduction": "Evolution is not governed by a single force, but by the interplay of several mechanisms. This practice explores the crucial tug-of-war between natural selection, a deterministic force that can maintain diversity, and genetic drift, the random fluctuation of allele frequencies. By determining the critical population size at which drift can overpower balancing selection, you will learn to appreciate that an allele's fate depends not only on its fitness effects but also on the size of the population in which it exists [@problem_id:2302253].", "problem": "An isolated island population of beetles has a single gene locus that determines their elytron (wing case) color. The two alleles at this locus are $A_1$ and $A_2$. The population is at a stable polymorphic equilibrium due to heterozygote advantage, where the heterozygous genotype ($A_1A_2$) has the highest fitness. The fitness of the heterozygote is normalized to $W_{12} = 1$. The homozygous genotypes, $A_1A_1$ and $A_2A_2$, are less fit due to poorer camouflage against the island's terrain. Their fitness values are given in terms of selection coefficients, $s_1$ and $s_2$, such that $W_{11} = 1 - s_1$ and $W_{22} = 1 - s_2$. For this population, the selection coefficients have been measured as $s_1 = 0.20$ and $s_2 = 0.10$.\n\nA sudden volcanic eruption causes a severe population bottleneck, drastically reducing the effective population size to a small number, $N_e$. In this small population, the influence of genetic drift may become strong enough to overpower the balancing selection that maintains the polymorphism.\n\nA widely used criterion in population genetics states that genetic drift is expected to be a more dominant evolutionary force than natural selection when the magnitude of the selection coefficient ($s$) is less than the reciprocal of twice the effective population size ($1/(2N_e)$).\n\nAssuming this criterion, calculate the critical effective population size, $N_c$, below which genetic drift would be considered a more powerful force than the weaker of the two selective pressures that maintain the polymorphism.", "solution": "The population exhibits overdominance with fitnesses $W_{11}=1-s_{1}$, $W_{12}=1$, and $W_{22}=1-s_{2}$, where $s_{1}=0.20$ and $s_{2}=0.10$. The criterion for drift dominating selection is that the magnitude of the selection coefficient satisfies $|s| < \\frac{1}{2N_e}$.\n\nTo find the critical effective population size $N_{c}$ at which drift and selection are equally strong for the weaker selective pressure, set the inequality to equality using the weaker coefficient $s=\\min(s_{1},s_{2})$:\n$$\n|s|=\\frac{1}{2N_{c}}.\n$$\nIdentify the weaker selection coefficient:\n$$\ns=\\min(s_{1},s_{2})=\\min(0.20,0.10)=0.10.\n$$\nSolve for $N_{c}$:\n$$\nN_{c}=\\frac{1}{2s}=\\frac{1}{2\\times 0.10}=\\frac{1}{0.20}=5.\n$$\nThus, for $N_{e}<5$, genetic drift is expected to dominate over the weaker of the two selective pressures maintaining the polymorphism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "2302253"}, {"introduction": "An allele's evolutionary success is not always determined by its own merits.
