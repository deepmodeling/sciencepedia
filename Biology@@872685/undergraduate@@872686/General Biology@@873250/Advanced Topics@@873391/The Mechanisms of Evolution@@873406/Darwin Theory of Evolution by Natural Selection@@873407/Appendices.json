This exercise challenges you to identify the correct mechanism of Darwinian evolution by contrasting it with common misconceptions, such as the inheritance of acquired characteristics. By analyzing the scenario of a grass population facing drought, you will practice applying the core principles of heritable variation and differential survival to explain adaptation. [@problem_id:2289555]", "problem": "A population of a perennial grass species, *Avena arida*, inhabits a temperate grassland ecosystem. Within this population, there is significant natural variation in the maximum depth that an individual's root system can reach. This variation in root depth is a heritable trait, primarily controlled by a set of genetic alleles. For many years, the region has experienced consistent, moderate rainfall, and both shallow-rooted and deep-rooted individuals have shown comparable survival and reproductive rates.\n\nRecently, the regional climate has undergone a significant shift, resulting in much longer and more frequent periods of severe drought. During these drought periods, the water in the upper layers of the soil is completely depleted, and the only accessible moisture is found in deeper soil horizons.\n\nAssuming this new climate pattern persists for many generations, which of the following statements most accurately describes the evolutionary process and outcome for the *Avena arida* population?\n\nA. In an effort to reach the deeper water, individual grass plants will actively grow their roots longer. This acquired characteristic of a longer root system will then be inherited by their offspring, causing the average root length of the population to increase over time.\n\nB. Individuals with pre-existing genetic variations that result in deeper root systems will have a higher probability of surviving the droughts and successfully reproducing. Consequently, the frequency of the alleles responsible for deep roots will increase in the population over many generations.\n\nC. The grass population, facing the threat of extinction from drought, will evolve deeper roots as a necessary adaptation for survival. This collective response is driven by the species' need to cope with the changed environment.\n\nD. The harsh drought conditions will act as a mutagenic agent, directly causing new mutations to arise in the grass population that code for deeper root systems. These newly induced beneficial mutations will then be selected for and spread.\n\nE. All individuals within the population will simultaneously and gradually develop deeper root systems in unison, ensuring the entire species adapts to the new climate conditions as a cohesive unit.", "solution": "We identify the key evolutionary ingredients in the scenario: there is heritable variation in root depth (genetic control of the trait), a new environmental regime that changes fitness differences among phenotypes (severe drought depleting shallow soil moisture while deeper soil retains water), and sufficient time for these differences to affect allele frequencies across generations. Evolution by natural selection requires: (i) heritable variation, (ii) differential survival and reproduction tied to that variation, and (iii) change in allele frequencies over generations. These conditions are met here.\n\nEvaluate each option against these principles:\n\n- Option A invokes inheritance of acquired characteristics. While an individual plant may plastically grow more roots in a given season, the statement claims that such acquired changes are inherited. In standard genetics, acquired characteristics are not inherited; only genetic differences are. Thus A is incorrect.\n\n- Option C proposes a goal-directed, need-based evolution. Evolution is not teleological; populations do not evolve traits because they “need” them. Rather, individuals with traits that confer higher fitness leave more offspring, shifting allele frequencies. Thus C is incorrect.\n\n- Option D claims that the drought directly causes targeted mutations for deeper roots. While environmental stress can alter mutation rates, mutation is not biased in the direction of need; beneficial mutations are not induced specifically by the environment’s demands. Adaptation proceeds by selection on pre-existing variation and on random (with respect to need) new variation. Thus D is incorrect.\n\n- Option E suggests simultaneous, uniform change in all individuals. Natural selection does not produce identical changes in all individuals at once; instead, individuals with higher-fitness heritable variants leave more offspring, so the population mean changes via allele frequency shifts. Thus E is incorrect.\n\n- Option B states that individuals already carrying alleles for deeper roots have higher survival and reproduction in drought, so those alleles increase in frequency over generations. This is the standard mechanism of natural selection acting on heritable variation and is correct.\n\nTo formalize the directional change in allele frequency, consider a single locus with two alleles: $D$ (deeper roots) and $S$ (shallower roots), with frequencies $p$ and $q$, where $p+q=1$. Let relative fitnesses under drought be\n$$\nw_{DD}=1,\\quad w_{DS}=1-hs,\\quad w_{SS}=1-s,\n$$\nwith $s>0$ representing selection against the shallow-root phenotype and $0\\leq h\\leq 1$ representing the dominance of the deleterious effect of $S$. The mean fitness is\n$$\n\\overline{w}=p^{2}w_{DD}+2pq\\,w_{DS}+q^{2}w_{SS}=1-2pqh s-q^{2}s.\n$$\nThe allele frequency of $D$ in the next generation is\n$$\np'=\\frac{p^{2}w_{DD}+p q\\, w_{DS}}{\\overline{w}}=\\frac{p\\left(1-h s q\\right)}{1-s\\left(2 p q h + q^{2}\\right)}.\n$$\nFor $s>0$ and $0<p<1$, one can compute\n$$\np'-p=\\frac{p\\, s\\, q\\left(2 p h + q - h\\right)}{1-s\\left(2 p q h + q^{2}\\right)}\\geq 0,\n$$\nwith strict inequality unless $p\\in\\{0,1\\}$. Hence, the deeper-root allele $D$ increases in frequency each generation under drought selection until it approaches fixation (modulo other forces such as mutation, migration, or drift). This formal result matches the verbal description in option B.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the evolutionary process and outcome is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2289555"}, {"introduction": "Evolution is not just a historical process; it is a quantifiable science that allows us to make predictions.
