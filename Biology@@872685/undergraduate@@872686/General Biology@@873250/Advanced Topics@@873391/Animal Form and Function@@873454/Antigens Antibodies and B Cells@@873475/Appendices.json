Through epitope mapping, it is determined that in its native, folded state, FASH presents a specific set of B-cell epitopes. There are 22 distinct conformational epitopes, which depend on the protein's correct three-dimensional folding. Additionally, there are 10 distinct linear epitopes, which are short, contiguous sequences of amino acids.\n\nThe immunologist prepares two separate immunization protocols for two groups of genetically identical mice.\n- **Group 1** is immunized with the native, correctly folded FASH protein.\n- **Group 2** is immunized with FASH that has been completely denatured by heat and a reducing agent, destroying all tertiary and secondary structure but leaving the primary amino acid sequence intact.\n\nAssume the following simplified model for the immune response:\n1.

The competitor is either unlabeled HSA (for the primary binding characterization) or BSA (for the cross-reactivity test). The amount of antibody that binds to the coated plate is inversely proportional to the affinity and concentration of the competitor in the solution. The resulting signal is an absorbance reading.\n\nThe experimental data for absorbance, $A$, as a function of competitor concentration, $C$, can be described by the following relationship:\n$$A(C) = A_{min} + \\frac{A_{max} - A_{min}}{1 + \\frac{C}{\\text{IC50}}}$$\nwhere $A_{max}$ is the maximum absorbance with zero competitor, $A_{min}$ is the background absorbance at saturating competitor concentrations, and IC50 is the concentration of the competitor that causes 50% inhibition of the maximum specific binding.\n\nThe following data were collected:\n- Maximum absorbance, $A_{max} = 1.800$\n- Minimum absorbance, $A_{min} = 0.050$\n- In the experiment with HSA as the competitor, an absorbance of $A = 0.650$ was measured at an HSA concentration of $C = 12.0$ ng/mL.\n- In the experiment with BSA as the competitor, an absorbance of $A = 0.925$ was measured at a BSA concentration of $C = 450.0$ ng/mL.\n\nCalculate the cross-reactivity of the antibody for BSA.

This advanced exercise [@problem_id:2279758] delves into the molecular machinery behind SHM, revealing how the enzyme Activation-Induced Deaminase (AID) and subsequent DNA repair pathways, like the one involving Uracil-DNA Glycosylase (UNG), generate a unique \"mutational signature.\" By analyzing these signatures, you can deduce the function of key repair enzymes and understand how this vital process of affinity maturation is mechanistically linked to the risk of B-cell lymphoma.", "problem": "In mature B lymphocytes, the process of somatic hypermutation (SHM) introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes, allowing for affinity maturation of antibodies. This process is initiated by the enzyme Activation-Induced Deaminase (AID), which deaminates cytosine (C) bases in single-stranded DNA to form uracil (U), creating a U:G mismatch. The cell's DNA repair machinery then processes this lesion through several pathways:\n\n1.  **UNG-Dependent Pathway**: The enzyme Uracil-DNA Glycosylase (UNG) recognizes and excises the uracil, creating an abasic (AP) site. This site is then processed by error-prone DNA polymerases, resulting in the introduction of any of the four nucleotides. This pathway is a major source of both transitions (e.g., C→T, G→A) and transversions (e.g., C→A, G→C) at C/G sites.\n2.  **Replication-Dependent Pathway**: If the U:G mismatch is not repaired before DNA replication, the uracil base pairs with adenine, leading to a C→T transition in one of the daughter cells.\n3.  **Mismatch Repair (MMR) Pathway**: The U:G mismatch can be recognized by the MMR system, which excises a larger patch of DNA around the mismatch. The subsequent repair synthesis, which can also be error-prone, is a primary source of mutations at nearby A/T base pairs.\n\nA researcher is investigating the interplay of these pathways by comparing two populations of cultured B cells undergoing SHM. One population is wild-type (WT), while the other has a homozygous loss-of-function mutation rendering UNG non-functional (UNG-/-). After extensive SHM, the immunoglobulin variable genes from both populations are sequenced, and the resulting point mutations are categorized. The aggregated data are presented in the two datasets below.\n\n**Dataset A**\n| Mutation Type               | Relative Frequency |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------|\n| Transitions at C/G sites    | 88%                |\n| Transversions at C/G sites  | 4%                 |\n| Mutations at A/T sites      | 8%                 |\n\n**Dataset B**\n| Mutation Type               | Relative Frequency |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------|\n| Transitions at C/G sites    | 45%                |\n| Transversions at C/G sites  | 25%                |\n| Mutations at A/T sites      | 30%                |\n\nWhile essential for immunity, the off-target activity of AID on non-immunoglobulin genes is a known driver of B-cell lymphomas. Based on your understanding of the molecular mechanisms described, identify which dataset corresponds to the UNG-deficient (UNG-/-) cells and predict the resulting impact on the risk of developing AID-driven B-cell lymphoma.\n\nA. Dataset A; The risk of lymphoma is likely increased because the loss of a key DNA repair pathway for AID-induced lesions leads to greater overall genomic instability.\n\nB. Dataset B; The risk of lymphoma is likely increased because the higher frequency of transversion and A/T mutations is more effective at activating proto-oncogenes.\n\nC. Dataset A; The risk of lymphoma is likely decreased because the mutational spectrum is restricted primarily to C→T transitions, which are less deleterious than the diverse mutations generated by the UNG-dependent pathway.\n\nD. Dataset B; The risk of lymphoma is likely decreased because in WT cells, functional UNG efficiently coordinates repair, minimizing the rate of oncogenic mutations.\n\nE. Dataset A; The risk of lymphoma is likely unchanged because the total frequency of mutations initiated by AID remains the same, regardless of the downstream repair pathway.", "solution": "1. State the initiating lesion and the competing processing pathways. AID converts cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA, creating a U:G mismatch. This lesion can be processed by: (i) UNG-dependent base excision repair (BER), in which UNG removes U to create an abasic site that is filled by error-prone polymerases, generating both transitions and transversions at C/G; (ii) replication bypass, where unrepaired U pairs with A, yielding predominantly C→T (and G→A) transitions at C/G; and (iii) mismatch repair (MMR), which excises a patch around the U:G and fills it with error-prone synthesis, producing mutations enriched at nearby A/T.\n\n2. Predict the wild-type (WT) mutational spectrum. With all three pathways active, WT cells show: (a) appreciable transversions at C/G from UNG-dependent BER; (b) a substantial fraction of mutations at A/T from MMR; and (c) transitions at C/G from both UNG-dependent processing and replication of unrepaired U. Therefore, WT should display a relatively balanced spectrum with significant transversions at C/G and a sizable A/T component rather than an overwhelming dominance of C/G transitions.\n\n3. Predict the UNG-deficient (UNG-/-) spectrum. Without UNG, the abasic intermediate is not generated, so the major source of C/G transversions is strongly reduced. Uracils persist and are frequently replicated over, markedly increasing C→T (and G→A) transitions. Additionally, A/T mutations from MMR typically diminish because strand-discrimination nicks created during UNG-initiated BER help recruit/process MMR; loss of UNG compromises this synergy, reducing A/T mutagenesis.\n\n4. Match datasets to genotypes. Dataset A shows a very high fraction of transitions at C/G with very low transversions at C/G and reduced A/T mutations, which is characteristic of UNG deficiency. Dataset B shows a more balanced distribution with substantial transversions at C/G and a prominent A/T fraction, consistent with WT.\n\n5. Infer lymphoma risk. UNG loss removes a key repair branch for AID-induced U:G mismatches, allowing more lesions to persist and be resolved by error-prone routes (notably replication-dependent transitions) and perturbing normal repair coordination. This promotes greater overall genomic instability at off-target AID sites, increasing the likelihood of oncogenic mutations and thus elevating the risk of AID-driven B-cell lymphoma.\n\nTherefore, the UNG-/- cells correspond to Dataset A, and the risk of lymphoma is increased due to loss of a key repair pathway and consequent genomic instability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2279758"}]}
