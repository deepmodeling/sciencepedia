{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A T cell's decision to activate begins with a physical conversation with an antigen-presenting cell. This exercise explores how the initial, weak binding of a T-cell receptor to its antigen triggers a strengthening of cell-cell adhesion, which is crucial for forming a stable immunological synapse. By modeling this process quantitatively, you will appreciate why sustained signaling requires more than just initial recognition [@problem_id:2316730].", "problem": "In a secondary lymphoid organ, the activation of a naive T cell requires the formation of a stable immunological synapse with an Antigen-Presenting Cell (APC). This process involves multiple molecular interactions. The T-Cell Receptor (TCR) on the T cell first scans the peptide-Major Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC) molecules on the surface of the APC. If the TCR recognizes its specific pMHC, this binding event (Signal 1) initiates an \"inside-out\" signaling cascade within the T cell. A key target of this cascade is the integrin adhesion molecule, Lymphocyte Function-associated Antigen 1 (LFA-1), which is present on the T cell surface. This signal causes LFA-1 to undergo a conformational change, transitioning from a default low-affinity state to a high-affinity state for its ligand, the Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1), which is expressed on the APC. This affinity maturation of LFA-1 is critical for stabilizing the cell-cell contact, allowing for sustained signaling and subsequent T cell activation.\n\nTo model the stability of this T cell-APC conjugate, we can consider its average interaction duration, $\\tau$. Assume that $\\tau$ is inversely proportional to the effective dissociation constant, $K_{d, \\text{eff}}$, of the entire synapse: $\\tau \\propto 1/K_{d, \\text{eff}}$. For simplicity, we model the effective dissociation constant as the product of the dissociation constants of the two key molecular pairs involved: $K_{d, \\text{eff}} = K_{d, \\text{TCR-pMHC}} \\times K_{d, \\text{LFA-1-ICAM-1}}$.\n\nThe relevant biophysical parameters are as follows:\n- The dissociation constant for the specific TCR-pMHC interaction is $K_{d, \\text{TCR-pMHC}} = 10.0 \\ \\mu\\text{M}$.\n- The dissociation constant for the LFA-1-ICAM-1 interaction in the low-affinity state is $K_{d, \\text{low}} = 100.0 \\ \\mu\\text{M}$.\n- The dissociation constant for the LFA-1-ICAM-1 interaction in the high-affinity state (post-TCR signaling) is $K_{d, \\text{high}} = 0.200 \\ \\mu\\text{M}$.\n\nNow, consider a mutant naive T cell that possesses a defect in its LFA-1 protein. This mutation completely blocks the \"inside-out\" signaling pathway from inducing the conformational change, so the LFA-1 molecule is permanently locked in its low-affinity state, even upon successful TCR-pMHC engagement. The function of the TCR and the baseline low-affinity binding of LFA-1 are otherwise normal.\n\nBoth a wild-type T cell and this mutant T cell encounter an APC presenting the correct pMHC. Calculate the ratio of the average interaction duration of the mutant T cell-APC conjugate ($\\tau_{\\text{mutant}}$) to that of the wild-type T cell-APC conjugate ($\\tau_{\\text{wild-type}}$). Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "We are told that the average interaction duration $\\tau$ is inversely proportional to the effective dissociation constant $K_{d,\\text{eff}}$.
