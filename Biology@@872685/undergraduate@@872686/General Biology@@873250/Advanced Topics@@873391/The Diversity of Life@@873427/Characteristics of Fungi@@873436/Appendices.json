A large, sealed glass terrarium is prepared. Inside, a layer of sterile soil is added, along with a decaying log that is heavily colonized by a pure culture of a saprophytic fungus.

The $CO_2$ concentration will first decrease as the fungus establishes itself, then increase sharply.", "solution": "The system is a sealed terrarium containing sterile soil and a decaying log colonized by a pure culture of a saprophytic fungus, with an initial atmosphere like Earth’s air and no light. The only significant biological process available to the fungus for energy is heterotrophic respiration of organic matter; there is no photosynthesis due to absence of light and fungi are not autotrophs. In particular, fungi are not chemoautotrophs and do not perform chemosynthesis to fix $CO_{2}$.\n\nThe fundamental biochemical pathway for heterotrophic decomposition is aerobic respiration, which converts organic carbon to $CO_{2}$ while consuming $O_{2}$. A representative stoichiometric equation for a carbohydrate substrate (e.g., glucose) is:\n$$\nC_{6}H_{12}O_{6}+6\\,O_{2}\\rightarrow 6\\,CO_{2}+6\\,H_{2}O.\n$$\nMore generally, for an organic substrate $C_{a}H_{b}O_{c}N_{d}$, aerobic catabolism produces $a$ moles of $CO_{2}$ per mole of substrate carbon fully oxidized (with water and nitrogenous products formed accordingly), so the net effect is conversion of solid-phase organic carbon in the log to gaseous $CO_{2}$.\n\nBecause the terrarium is sealed, the total amount of carbon is conserved, but its distribution among pools can change. Denote by $n_{CO_{2}}(t)$ the moles of $CO_{2}$ in the gas phase, and by $n_{C,\\text{org}}(t)$ the moles of carbon in the solid organic pool (the log and any fungal biomass). Carbon conservation implies\n$$\nn_{C,\\text{tot}}=n_{CO_{2}}(t)+n_{C,\\text{org}}(t)+n_{C,\\text{aq}}(t),\n$$\nwhere $n_{C,\\text{aq}}(t)$ accounts for dissolved inorganic carbon in soil water. Heterotrophic respiration increases inorganic carbon at the expense of organic carbon, so\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left[n_{CO_{2}}(t)+n_{C,\\text{aq}}(t)\\right]= -\\frac{d}{dt}n_{C,\\text{org}}(t)>0\n$$\nas long as decomposition proceeds. While partitioning between gas and aqueous phases is governed by equilibrium (e.g., Henry’s law), the production term from respiration drives the gas-phase partial pressure of $CO_{2}$ upward over time until limited by $O_{2}$ depletion or substrate exhaustion. There is no biological sink in this system that would reduce $CO_{2}$: there is no photosynthesis in the dark, and the fungus does not fix $CO_{2}$ via chemosynthesis.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is incorrect because fungi are not chemoautotrophs and do not consume $CO_{2}$ to synthesize biomass using chemical energy sources.\n- Option B is incorrect because, although the system is sealed, internal transformations convert organic carbon into $CO_{2}$, changing gas concentrations.\n- Option D is incorrect because the dominant process (respiration) creates a clear increasing trend rather than random fluctuations.\n- Option E is incorrect because there is no mechanism for an initial decrease in $CO_{2}$; even during any microbial lag phase, respiration still produces some $CO_{2}$, and there is no $CO_{2}$ sink.\n\nThe expected outcome over several weeks is that $CO_{2}$ concentration increases as the fungus decomposes the organic matter in the log, consuming $O_{2}$ and producing $CO_{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2285183"}, {"introduction": "Many fungi engage in intricate symbiotic relationships, most notably with plants.

To determine the nature of their interaction, they conduct a two-part experiment using isotopes.\n\nIn Experiment 1, a set of *P. alpina* plants infected with the fungus is grown in a sealed, atmospherically controlled chamber. The carbon dioxide provided to the chamber is synthesized with the stable, heavy isotope of carbon, Carbon-13 ($^{13}\\text{CO}_2$), instead of the common Carbon-12 ($^{12}\\text{CO}_2$). After several weeks, tissue samples from both the plant's leaves and the fungal hyphae within the roots are analyzed using mass spectrometry. The analysis reveals a significant enrichment of $^{13}\\text{C}$ in the organic molecules of both the plant and the fungus.\n\nIn Experiment 2, a separate, identical set of infected plants is grown in a chamber with a normal atmosphere ($^{12}\\text{CO}_2$). However, the sterile nutrient solution supplied to the roots contains ammonium salts prepared with the stable, heavy isotope of nitrogen, Nitrogen-15 ($^{15}\\text{N}$), as the sole nitrogen source. After the same growth period, analysis of the plant leaves shows a significant enrichment of $^{15}\\text{N}$ in the plant's amino acids, while analysis of control plants grown without the fungus but with the same $^{15}\\text{N}$ nutrient solution shows a significantly lower uptake of $^{15}\\text{N}$.\n\nBased on the combined results of these two experiments, which of the following statements provides the most accurate conclusion about the relationship between *Poa alpina* and the fungus?\n\nA. The fungus is a parasite that acquires carbon from the plant and inhibits the plant's ability to absorb nitrogen.\n\nB. The relationship is commensal, where the fungus benefits by consuming plant-derived carbon, and the plant is unaffected.\n\nC. The fungus and the plant are competitors for both carbon and nitrogen resources in the root zone.\n\nD. The relationship is mutualistic, where the plant provides the fungus with carbon compounds and the fungus enhances the plant's acquisition of nitrogen.\n\nE.

Photosynthetic plants assimilate carbon from $\\text{CO}_{2}$; non-photosynthetic fungi do not fix $\\text{CO}_{2}$. Therefore, the primary entry point of $^{13}\\text{C}$ into biomass is plant photosynthesis. The observations are:\n- $R_{\\text{plant}}^{13\\text{C}}$ is enriched, consistent with photosynthetic fixation of $^{13}\\text{C}$ into plant organic molecules.\n- $R_{\\text{fungus}}^{13\\text{C}}$ is also enriched in fungal hyphae within roots.\n\nBecause the fungus cannot directly assimilate $^{13}\\text{CO}_{2}$, enrichment of $^{13}\\text{C}$ in the fungus requires transfer of plant-derived carbon compounds to the fungus. Hence, Experiment 1 implies $J_{C,p\\to f} > 0$.\n\nExperiment 2 supplies identical plants with $^{12}\\text{CO}_{2}$ atmosphere while the only nitrogen source in the root solution is $^{15}\\text{N}$-labeled ammonium. Observations:\n- Infected plants show significantly higher $R_{\\text{plant}}^{15\\text{N}}$ in amino acids than control plants grown without the fungus under the same $^{15}\\text{N}$ conditions.\n\nIf the fungus inhibited plant nitrogen uptake or merely competed for nitrogen, we would expect $R_{\\text{plant}}^{15\\text{N}}$ in infected plants to be lower than or equal to controls. The observed increase indicates that fungal colonization enhances nitrogen acquisition and/or transfer to the plant, i.e., $J_{N,f\\to p} > 0$.\n\nCombining both experiments:\n- Experiment 1: $J_{C,p\\to f} > 0$ (plant supplies carbon to fungus).\n- Experiment 2: $J_{N,f\\to p} > 0$ (fungus enhances and transfers nitrogen to plant).\n\nThis bidirectional exchange of resources—plant-to-fungus carbon and fungus-to-plant nitrogen—is diagnostic of a mutualistic symbiosis akin to mycorrhizal associations. This rules out alternative interpretations:\n- Parasitisim (A) is contradicted by enhanced plant $^{15}\\text{N}$ uptake.\n- Commensalism (B) is contradicted by measurable plant benefit in nitrogen acquisition.\n- Competition (C) would not increase plant $^{15}\\text{N}$ beyond controls.\n- Saprophytism in the sterile nutrient solution (E) is inconsistent with fungal $^{13}\\text{C}$ enrichment originating from plant photosynthate.\n- Nitrogen flow from plant to fungus (F) is opposite to the observed enhancement of plant $^{15}\\text{N}$.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is a mutualistic relationship in which the plant provides carbon compounds to the fungus, and the fungus enhances the plant’s nitrogen acquisition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2285220"}, {"introduction": "After establishing that fungi and plants exchange resources, the next step is to quantify that exchange.
