This exercise presents a classic botanical puzzle, the whisk fern (*Psilotum*), which lacks true roots and leaves, superficially resembling early, simple land plants. By working through this problem, you will practice using fundamental anatomical evidence—the definitive traits that unite a major plant group—to correctly classify an organism, learning to prioritize core diagnostic features over misleading superficial traits [@problem_id:2290348].", "problem": "Whisk ferns of the genus *Psilotum* present a phylogenetic puzzle to introductory botany students. They possess a dichotomously branching stem, lack true roots (possessing rhizoids instead), and have scale-like appendages called enations that are not true leaves. These features give them a superficial resemblance to some of the earliest fossil land plants and might suggest they are related to nonvascular plants (bryophytes). Despite these characteristics, botanists definitively classify *Psilotum* as a vascular plant (Tracheophyte). Which of the following observations provides the most direct and conclusive anatomical evidence for this classification?\n\nA. The presence of a waxy cuticle covering the epidermis of the stem.\n\nB. The life cycle exhibits a clear alternation between sporophyte and gametophyte generations.\n\nC. Microscopic cross-sections of the stem reveal a central core of lignified xylem and phloem tissues.\n\nD. The plant reproduces via spores produced in fused sporangia, known as synangia.\n\nE. Hair-like rhizoids anchor the underground stem (rhizome) to its substrate.", "solution": "Goal: Identify the most direct and conclusive anatomical evidence that Psilotum is a vascular plant (Tracheophyte).\n\nPrinciple: Tracheophytes are defined by the presence of specialized vascular tissues—lignified xylem for water and mineral conduction (composed of tracheids and/or vessel elements) and phloem for photosynthate transport. The diagnostic anatomical hallmark is lignified xylem tissue paired with phloem.\n\nAnalysis of options:\n- Option A (waxy cuticle): A cuticle is common to most land plants, including many bryophytes; it is not diagnostic of vascular status.\n- Option B (alternation of generations): Alternation of generations occurs in all land plants, including bryophytes; it is not specific to vascular plants.\n- Option C (central core of lignified xylem and phloem): Direct anatomical evidence of true vascular tissue with lignified xylem conclusively indicates a tracheophyte.\n- Option D (spore reproduction via synangia): Spore-based reproduction is widespread and occurs in bryophytes as well; structure of sporangia is not definitive for vascular status.\n- Option E (rhizoids): Rhizoids occur in bryophytes and some vascular plant gametophytes; their presence does not diagnose vascular tissue in the sporophyte.\n\nConclusion: The observation that directly and conclusively establishes Psilotum as a vascular plant is the presence of lignified xylem and associated phloem in the stem, as stated in Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2290348"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of a biological process often comes from considering what happens when it goes wrong. This thought experiment challenges you to trace the consequences of a hypothetical mutation that disrupts the normal life cycle of a fern [@problem_id:2290389].

Fertilization of these gametes forms a diploid (2n) zygote that grows into a new sporophyte.\n\nConsider a hypothetical mutation in a species of fern. In this mutant strain, the cells within the sporangia that are supposed to produce spores undergo a single round of mitosis instead of meiosis.

This difference is not arbitrary; it is governed by fundamental physical laws and distinct biological strategies for survival. This practice problem invites you to apply principles of biophysics to compare the mechanisms of water transport in vascular and nonvascular plants, using quantitative reasoning to understand the constraints and evolutionary innovations that dictate plant form and function [@problem_id:2290374].", "problem": "An ecologist is studying the biophysical limitations on plant height by contrasting two organisms at the extremes of the plant kingdom: a giant redwood tree (*Sequoia sempervirens*) and a common moss (*Polytrichum commune*). The redwood stands at a height of $H_R = 100~\\text{m}$ and transports water internally through its xylem, which consists of vessels with a typical effective radius of $r_R = 25~\\mu\\text{m}$. The moss is nonvascular and only reaches a height of $H_M = 5.0~\\text{cm}$. While it lacks true xylem, it can move water externally and through its simple tissues via capillary action, with an effective capillary radius of its water-conducting surfaces estimated to be $r_M = 50~\\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nTo understand the different strategies these plants employ to move water against gravity, evaluate the physical principles at play. Assume the water is pure. Use the following physical constants:\n- Density of water, $\\rho = 1.00 \\times 10^3 \\text{ kg/m}^3$\n- Acceleration of gravity, $g = 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2$\n- Surface tension of water, $\\gamma = 0.072 \\text{ N/m}$\n\nAssume that for capillary action, the contact angle of water with the plant surfaces is 0 degrees (perfect wetting).\n\nSelect all of the following statements that correctly contrast the biophysical constraints on water transport in these two plants.\n\nA. The component of water potential needed to counteract gravity is exactly 2000 times larger for the redwood than for the moss.\n\nB. Capillary rise, based on the provided radii, is a plausible primary mechanism for lifting water to the full height of the moss, but accounts for less than 1% of the height of the redwood.\n\nC. For water to reach the apex of the redwood, the gauge pressure of the water at the top must be negative and have a magnitude of at least 0.9 MegaPascals (MPa), a condition not necessary for the moss.\n\nD. The physical state of water under high tension in the redwood's transport system makes it vulnerable to catastrophic failure via cavitation, a risk that is negligible in the low-pressure system of the moss.\n\nE. The rate of water transport via simple diffusion over the required vertical distance is faster in the moss than in the redwood, but is a biologically significant mechanism for bulk flow in both plants.", "solution": "We model the gravitational component of water potential and capillarity to contrast constraints.\n\nGravitational water potential difference over a vertical height $H$ is\n$$\n\\Delta \\psi_{g}=\\rho g H,\n$$\nwith units of pressure. For the redwood and moss,\n$$\n\\Delta \\psi_{g,R}=\\rho g H_{R},\\quad \\Delta \\psi_{g,M}=\\rho g H_{M}.\n$$\nTheir ratio is\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta \\psi_{g,R}}{\\Delta \\psi_{g,M}}=\\frac{H_{R}}{H_{M}}=\\frac{100}{0.050}=2000,\n$$\nso the gravitational component required is exactly $2000$ times larger for the redwood. Thus A is correct.\n\nCapillary rise in a tube or pore of radius $r$ with perfect wetting ($\\theta=0$ so $\\cos\\theta=1$) satisfies\n$$\nh=\\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{\\rho g r}=\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\rho g r}.\n$$\nFor the moss with $r_{M}=50\\times 10^{-6}\\text{ m}$,\n$$\nh_{M}=\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\rho g r_{M}}=\\frac{2\\cdot 0.072}{(1.00\\times 10^{3})(9.81)(50\\times 10^{-6})}\\approx 0.294\\text{ m},\n$$\nwhich exceeds its height $H_{M}=0.050\\text{ m}$, so capillarity plausibly lifts water the full moss height. For the redwood with $r_{R}=25\\times 10^{-6}\\text{ m}$,\n$$\nh_{R}=\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\rho g r_{R}}=\\frac{2\\cdot 0.072}{(1.00\\times 10^{3})(9.81)(25\\times 10^{-6})}\\approx 0.588\\text{ m}.\n$$\nRelative to $H_{R}=100\\text{ m}$, this is\n$$\n\\frac{h_{R}}{H_{R}}\\approx \\frac{0.588}{100}=0.00588<0.01,\n$$\ni.e., less than $0.01$ of the redwood’s height. Thus B is correct.\n\nFor the redwood, to statically support a water column to height $H_{R}$, the gauge pressure at the top relative to local atmospheric must be\n$$\np_{\\text{top}}-p_{\\text{atm}}=-\\rho g H_{R}=-(1.00\\times 10^{3})(9.81)(100)\\text{ Pa}\\approx -9.81\\times 10^{5}\\text{ Pa},\n$$\nwhose magnitude is approximately $0.981\\text{ MPa}$, which is at least $0.9\\text{ MPa}$. For the moss, the gravitational requirement is only\n$$\n\\rho g H_{M}=(1.00\\times 10^{3})(9.81)(0.050)\\text{ Pa}\\approx 4.91\\times 10^{2}\\text{ Pa},\n$$\nand capillary suction available at the meniscus is\n$$\n\\Delta p_{\\text{cap}}=\\frac{2\\gamma}{r_{M}}=\\frac{2\\cdot 0.072}{50\\times 10^{-6}}\\text{ Pa}\\approx 2.88\\times 10^{3}\\text{ Pa},\n$$\nwhich comfortably exceeds the gravitational requirement. The redwood therefore requires large negative gauge pressure at the top of order $10^{6}\\text{ Pa}$, whereas such a large negative pressure is not necessary for the moss. Thus C is correct.\n\nUnder such high tension (negative pressure potential) in the redwood xylem, water is metastable and vulnerable to cavitation (formation of vapor embolisms), which can catastrophically interrupt flow. In the moss, water is moved through external films and small pores with low absolute tension and short path lengths; with only small negative pressures needed (of order $10^{3}\\text{ Pa}$), the risk of cavitation is negligible by comparison. Thus D is correct.\n\nDiffusion over a distance $L$ has a characteristic timescale $t\\sim L^{2}/D$. Hence $t$ scales with $L^{2}$, so diffusion is indeed faster over $L=0.050\\text{ m}$ than over $L=100\\text{ m}$, by a factor $\\left(\\frac{100}{0.050}\\right)^{2}=2000^{2}=4.0\\times 10^{6}$. However, diffusion is not a mechanism for bulk flow; it is molecular random motion without net convective transport and, even over centimeters, is far too slow to meet the water flux demands of living plants. Therefore the claim that diffusion is a biologically significant mechanism for bulk flow in both plants is false. Thus E is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct choices are A, B, C, and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCD}$$", "id": "2290374"}]}
