Before delving into the intricate folds and turns, it's essential to appreciate the sheer combinatorial diversity that this sequence allows. This practice problem provides a hands-on way to calculate this potential, illustrating how even a small set of amino acid \"building blocks\" can generate a vast library of unique molecules. Understanding this principle is the first step in appreciating how sequence encodes structure and function.

A tripeptide is a molecule formed by linking three amino acids together via peptide bonds. The specific sequence of these amino acids defines the tripeptide's primary structure, which is crucial for its function. For this experiment, only three amino acids are available: Glycine (Gly), Alanine (Ala), and Valine (Val). Any of these three amino acids can be placed at any of the three positions in the tripeptide chain, and an amino acid can be used more than once in a single molecule. Calculate the total number of unique tripeptide sequences that can be synthesized.", "solution": "A tripeptide consists of three ordered positions. The available set of amino acids has size $k=3$ (Gly, Ala, Val).

This exercise explores one of the most famous examples: the heptad repeat. By analyzing a polypeptide with a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern, you can deduce how it will fold and assemble, revealing the direct link between a simple sequence rule and a complex, elegant structure known as a coiled-coil. This practice demonstrates how we can begin to \"read\" a primary sequence to foresee its final architectural form. [@problem_id:2310446]", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment, a research team designs a novel polypeptide intended for self-assembly into a nanomaterial. The primary structure of this polypeptide consists of a long, repeating sequence of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat, with the general form $(abcdefg)_n$. Through site-directed mutagenesis, the team ensures that the amino acid residues at positions 'a' and 'd' of every repeat are strongly hydrophobic (e.g., Leucine, Isoleucine), while the residues at positions 'b', 'c', 'e', 'f', and 'g' are predominantly hydrophilic or charged. Assuming this polypeptide is placed in a neutral aqueous buffer, predict the most likely secondary and quaternary structures that will form.\n\nA. The polypeptide chains will form alpha-helices, which will then intertwine with each other to form a multi-stranded coiled-coil structure.\n\nB. The polypeptide chains will form beta-strands, which will align to create a large, flat beta-pleated sheet stabilized by inter-chain hydrogen bonds.\n\nC. Each polypeptide chain will fold independently into a compact globular monomer, burying the hydrophobic residues in a central core.\n\nD. The polypeptide chains will form beta-barrels, where a single large beta-sheet curves back on itself to form a closed, cylindrical structure.\n\nE. The polypeptide chains will remain as random coils, as the repeating hydrophobic residues prevent the formation of any stable, ordered structure.", "solution": "We are given a polypeptide with a heptad repeat $(abcdefg)_{n}$ in which positions $a$ and $d$ are strongly hydrophobic and positions $b$, $c$, $e$, $f$, and $g$ are hydrophilic or charged. In a neutral aqueous buffer, the driving force for folding and assembly is the hydrophobic effect, which favors burial of hydrophobic side chains away from solvent while exposing hydrophilic or charged residues to solvent.\n\nKey structural principle: in an alpha-helix, side chains from residues $i$ and $i+3$ or $i+4$ project to a similar face of the helix. Thus, a pattern with hydrophobics at positions separated by three and four residues along a repeating heptad produces an amphipathic helix with a continuous hydrophobic stripe (the $a$ and $d$ positions) along one face and hydrophilic residues on the opposite face. This is the canonical coiled-coil heptad pattern, where $a$ and $d$ form the hydrophobic interface between helices. Consequently, the most favorable secondary structure is an alpha-helix that presents the $a,d$ hydrophobics as a seam.\n\nQuaternary assembly follows by association of two or more such amphipathic alpha-helices so that their hydrophobic seams pack against each other, burying the hydrophobic $a,d$ side chains in the oligomeric core while the hydrophilic $b,c,e,f,g$ residues remain solvent-exposed. This produces a multi-stranded coiled-coil superstructure (e.g., dimers, trimers, etc.), stabilized by hydrophobic packing and interhelical interactions.\n\nExcluding alternatives:\n- Beta-strands in extended beta-sheets typically exploit an alternating hydrophobic/hydrophilic pattern at nearly every other residue, not the heptad $a,d$ pattern; thus option B is not favored by the given sequence design.\n- Beta-barrels likewise require a repeating alternation suited for curved beta-sheets; the stated $a,d$ hydrophobic pattern does not match this requirement, so D is unlikely.\n- A compact monomeric globular fold (C) would need a diverse, non-repetitive distribution to create an intramolecular core; the long repetitive heptad with designed interface residues is optimized for intermolecular coiled-coil assembly rather than a single-chain core.\n- Random coil (E) is disfavored because the amphipathic pattern promotes helix formation and specific helix-helix packing; furthermore, leucine and isoleucine at $a,d$ are helix-compatible and drive oligomerization.\n\nTherefore, the predicted secondary structure is alpha-helices, and the quaternary structure is a multi-stranded coiled-coil.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2310446"}, {"introduction": "Moving from simple motifs to entire proteins, especially those embedded in cell membranes, requires more sophisticated tools.
