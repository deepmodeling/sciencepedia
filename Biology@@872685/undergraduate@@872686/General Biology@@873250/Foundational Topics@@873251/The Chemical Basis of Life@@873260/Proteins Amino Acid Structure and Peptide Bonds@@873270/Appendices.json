The mass of a water molecule is given as $m_{H_2O} = 18.02$ Da.\n\nThe problem provides three key pieces of information and the definitions needed to interpret them:\n1.  Total mass, $M_{total} = 299.19$ Da\n2.  $b_2$ ion mass, $m(b_2) = 168.09$ Da\n3.  $y_2$ ion mass, $m(y_2) = 202.14$ Da\n\nBased on the provided definitions, we can establish a system of equations:\nEquation (1): $M_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + m_{H_2O}$\nEquation (2): $m(b_2) = R_1 + R_2$\nEquation (3): $m(y_2) = R_2 + R_3 + m_{H_2O}$\n\nOur goal is to solve for the individual residue masses $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$, and then identify the corresponding amino acids from the table.\n\nFirst, let's find the C-terminal residue mass, $R_3$. We can substitute Equation (2) into Equation (1):\n$M_{total} = (R_1 + R_2) + R_3 + m_{H_2O}$\n$M_{total} = m(b_2) + R_3 + m_{H_2O}$\n\nNow, we solve for $R_3$:\n$R_3 = M_{total} - m(b_2) - m_{H_2O}$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$R_3 = 299.19 - 168.09 - 18.02 = 113.08$ Da\nConsulting the table, a residue mass of $113.08$ Da corresponds to either Leucine (L) or Isoleucine (I). Since all options only involve Leucine among the two, we conclude that the C-terminal amino acid, $AA_3$, is Leucine.\n\nNext, let's find the N-terminal residue mass, $R_1$. We can express the sum $R_2 + R_3$ from Equation (3) as $R_2 + R_3 = m(y_2) - m_{H_2O}$. We substitute this into Equation (1):\n$M_{total} = R_1 + (R_2 + R_3) + m_{H_2O}$\n$M_{total} = R_1 + (m(y_2) - m_{H_2O}) + m_{H_2O}$\n$M_{total} = R_1 + m(y_2)$\n\nNow, we solve for $R_1$:\n$R_1 = M_{total} - m(y_2)$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$R_1 = 299.19 - 202.14 = 97.05$ Da\nConsulting the table, a residue mass of $97.05$ Da corresponds to Proline (P). Therefore, the N-terminal amino acid, $AA_1$, is Proline.\n\nFinally, we find the central residue mass, $R_2$. We can use Equation (2) and the value we found for $R_1$:\n$m(b_2) = R_1 + R_2$\n$R_2 = m(b_2) - R_1$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$R_2 = 168.09 - 97.05 = 71.04$ Da\nConsulting the table, a residue mass of $71.04$ Da corresponds to Alanine (A). Thus, the central amino acid, $AA_2$, is Alanine.\n\nThe sequence of the tripeptide is $AA_1-AA_2-AA_3$, which corresponds to Proline-Alanine-Leucine (Pro-Ala-Leu).\n\nComparing this result with the given choices:\nA.
