[@problem_id:2294152]", "problem": "In the field of astrobiology, the search for extraterrestrial life is often guided by the principle of \"follow the water.\" The exceptional properties of water as a solvent are considered crucial for the chemistry of life. Imagine two hypothetical exoplanets, Kepler-X and Trappist-Y, both possessing vast oceans of liquid water. The atmosphere of Kepler-X is rich in ammonia ($NH_3$), while the atmosphere of Trappist-Y is rich in methane ($CH_4$). For a \"primordial soup\" to form, it is advantageous for atmospheric gases to dissolve in the planetary oceans.\n\nBased on the fundamental principles of molecular polarity and intermolecular forces, which of the following statements most accurately predicts and explains the relative solubility of these two gases in water?\n\nA. Ammonia ($NH_3$) will be more soluble because it is a polar molecule capable of forming hydrogen bonds with the polar water molecules, whereas methane ($CH_4$) is nonpolar.\n\nB. Methane ($CH_4$) will be more soluble because its lower molecular weight allows it to more easily fit into the spaces between water molecules.\n\nC. Both gases will have very similar solubilities because the strength of London dispersion forces is comparable for both molecules.\n\nD. Methane ($CH_4$) will be more soluble because its symmetrical tetrahedral shape allows it to interact favorably with the water lattice.\n\nE. Ammonia ($NH_3$) will be more soluble because it is a weaker acid than water, preventing it from reacting and allowing it to dissolve.", "solution": "We are asked to predict the relative solubility in water of two atmospheric gases, $NH_{3}$ and $CH_{4}$, using molecular polarity and intermolecular forces.\n\nFirst, determine polarity. $NH_{3}$ has a trigonal pyramidal geometry with a lone pair on nitrogen, producing a net dipole moment; it is polar. $CH_{4}$ has a tetrahedral geometry with four identical $C\\!-\\!H$ bonds arranged symmetrically, producing zero net dipole moment; it is nonpolar.\n\nSecond, identify possible intermolecular interactions with water. Water, $H_{2}O$, is highly polar and forms an extended hydrogen-bond network. $NH_{3}$ can both accept hydrogen bonds (via the lone pair on nitrogen) and donate hydrogen bonds (via $N\\!-\\!H$ bonds), allowing strong specific interactions with water molecules. In contrast, $CH_{4}$ cannot participate in hydrogen bonding and interacts with water only through weak London dispersion forces; its dissolution is disfavored by the hydrophobic effect, making its solubility very low.\n\nThird, apply the general principle “like dissolves like”: polar solutes (especially those capable of hydrogen bonding) are more soluble in polar solvents such as water, while nonpolar solutes are poorly soluble.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n\n- A: Correct. $NH_{3}$ is polar and can form hydrogen bonds with water; $CH_{4}$ is nonpolar and cannot. This directly explains higher solubility of $NH_{3}$.\n- B: Incorrect. Molecular weight alone does not overcome the lack of favorable interactions; $CH_{4}$ remains nonpolar and poorly soluble despite being lighter.\n- C: Incorrect. While both experience London dispersion forces, this ignores the dominant hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions available to $NH_{3}$ but not to $CH_{4}$, leading to very different solubilities.\n- D: Incorrect. Symmetry of $CH_{4}$ correlates with nonpolarity and does not create favorable interactions with water’s hydrogen-bond network.\n- E: Incorrect rationale. $NH_{3}$ is a weak base, not a weaker acid than water, and in water it undergoes $NH_{3}+H_{2}O \\rightleftharpoons NH_{4}^{+}+OH^{-}$, which actually supports its dissolution, but the decisive explanation for greater solubility is its polarity and hydrogen bonding, not acid strength considerations.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate predictive and explanatory statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2294152"}, {"introduction": "The selective permeability of the cell membrane, coupled with water's solvent properties, gives rise to osmosis—the net movement of water across the membrane. This process is fundamental to maintaining cellular volume and function. This practice problem presents a classic biological scenario, asking you to explain why a red blood cell ruptures in pure water, thereby solidifying your understanding of hypotonic solutions and water potential. [@problem_id:2347055]", "problem": "A cell biology student is investigating the principles of osmosis using mammalian Red Blood Cells (RBCs). The cytoplasm of these cells contains a complex mixture of proteins, salts, and other molecules, resulting in an internal solute concentration that is isotonic to a 0.9% (mass/volume) sodium chloride solution. The student carefully transfers a sample of these RBCs into a beaker containing a large volume of pure, deionized water. Within minutes, the student observes through a microscope that the RBCs swell and then rupture, a phenomenon known as hemolysis.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most complete and accurate molecular explanation for this observation, correctly linking the properties of the water molecule, the cell membrane, and the internal cellular environment?\n\nA. As a universal solvent, water begins to dissolve the nonpolar lipid components of the RBC membrane, causing the membrane to lose its integrity and the cell to fall apart.\n\nB. The high specific heat of water allows it to absorb significant energy from the RBCs, causing the internal cytoplasm to cool and contract, which pulls the membrane apart.\n\nC. The RBCs' active transport systems, which normally maintain ion balance, malfunction in the pure water environment and begin to actively pump water molecules into the cell, causing it to overfill and burst.\n\nD. Because water is a polar molecule, it can move across the semipermeable cell membrane, but the dissolved polar and charged solutes within the cell cannot easily pass out. This creates a water potential gradient that drives the net diffusion of water into the hypertonic cytoplasm, leading to an increase in hydrostatic pressure that ruptures the cell.\n\nE. The deionized water, lacking any ions, has a strong chemical affinity for the salts inside the RBC. This creates a powerful attractive force that pulls the cell membrane outwards until it tears.", "solution": "The problem asks for the best explanation for why Red Blood Cells (RBCs) undergo hemolysis (rupture) when placed in pure, deionized water. This requires an understanding of osmosis, the properties of water, and the structure of the cell membrane.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the initial conditions.\nThe RBC has a higher concentration of solutes (salts, proteins, etc.) inside its cytoplasm compared to the surrounding pure deionized water. In osmotic terms, the cell's internal environment is **hypertonic** (higher solute concentration) relative to the external environment, which is **hypotonic** (lower solute concentration).\n\nStep 2: Consider the properties of the key components.\n- **Water ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$)**: Water is a **polar molecule**. The oxygen atom has a partial negative charge ($\\delta^-$), and the hydrogen atoms have partial positive charges ($\\delta^+$). This polarity makes water an excellent solvent for other polar or charged substances (like the salts and many proteins inside the RBC), but a poor solvent for nonpolar substances.\n- **Cell Membrane**: The RBC membrane is a phospholipid bilayer. The \"heads\" of the phospholipids are polar/hydrophilic, while the \"tails\" are nonpolar/hydrophobic. This structure makes the membrane an effective barrier to the passage of large, polar, or charged solutes. However, small, polar molecules like water can pass through it, either by diffusing directly across the bilayer to a limited extent or more rapidly through specialized protein channels called aquaporins. The membrane is therefore **semipermeable**: it allows the solvent (water) to pass through but restricts the movement of most solutes.\n\nStep 3: Apply the principle of osmosis.\nOsmosis is the net movement of solvent molecules (in this case, water) across a semipermeable membrane from a region of higher solvent concentration (and lower solute concentration) to a region of lower solvent concentration (and higher solute concentration). This movement occurs down the water potential gradient. The pure water outside the cell has a higher water potential (higher concentration of free water molecules) than the cytoplasm inside the cell, where many water molecules are associated with solute particles.\n\nStep 4: Predict the movement of water.\nDue to the water potential gradient described in Step 3, there will be a net movement of water from the outside (hypotonic solution) into the RBC's cytoplasm (hypertonic solution).\n\nStep 5: Determine the consequence for the cell.\nAs water continuously enters the RBC, its volume increases, and it begins to swell. Animal cells, unlike plant cells, do not have a rigid cell wall to withstand this increase in internal hydrostatic pressure (turgor pressure). The plasma membrane is stretched beyond its elastic limit and eventually ruptures, releasing the cell's contents. This is hemolysis.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the given options based on this understanding.\n- **A**: This is incorrect. Water is a poor solvent for the nonpolar lipid tails that form the core of the membrane. The membrane does not dissolve in water.\n- **B**: This is incorrect. The specific heat of water relates to its ability to resist temperature changes, which is not the primary mechanism causing the cell to rupture in this isothermal scenario.\n- **C**: This is incorrect. Water movement via osmosis is a passive process (diffusion) and does not require active transport or ATP. Active transport pumps move solutes, not water, against their concentration gradients.\n- **D**: This statement accurately describes the entire process. It correctly identifies water as polar, the membrane as semipermeable, the solutes as being trapped inside, the resulting water potential gradient, the net movement of water into the hypertonic cell (osmosis), and the subsequent rupture due to increased hydrostatic pressure. This is the most complete and accurate explanation.\n- **E**: This is incorrect. While there is a concentration gradient, it does not manifest as a direct physical \"pull\" on the membrane. The force is generated by the net influx of water molecules increasing the internal pressure. The language of a \"powerful attractive force pulling the cell membrane outwards\" is a physically inaccurate description of osmosis.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the best explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2347055"}, {"introduction": "True understanding of a scientific principle is often demonstrated by the ability to apply it in a novel, unfamiliar context.

Unlike life on Earth, where the universal solvent is polar water, this organism's cytoplasm is composed primarily of nonpolar liquid methane ($CH_4$).

The cell membrane is a standard phospholipid bilayer with polar heads facing the exterior and cytoplasm, and nonpolar tails forming the core.

The cell membrane is a monolayer composed entirely of nonpolar molecules. Soluble proteins are unfolded, existing as random coils, because the nonpolar environment cannot support a stable tertiary structure.", "solution": "I begin with the fundamental principle of solvation: like dissolves like. In polar solvents (e.g., water), polar and charged groups are stabilized via dipole interactions, hydrogen bonding, and ion-dipole interactions; nonpolar groups are poorly solvated and are driven to minimize contact with the solvent. In nonpolar solvents (e.g., liquid methane, $CH_4$), nonpolar groups are well solvated by dispersion forces, whereas polar/charged groups suffer poor solvation and thus tend to avoid exposure to the solvent.\n\nIn water-based life, amphiphilic lipids assemble into bilayers with polar headgroups interfacing with the aqueous exterior and cytoplasm, and nonpolar hydrocarbon tails forming the membrane core. Proteins fold with nonpolar residues buried in the interior to avoid water, and polar/charged residues exposed on the surface to interact favorably with water. This pattern results from the hydrophobic effect and the differential solvation energies in a polar medium.\n\nIn a nonpolar solvent such as liquid methane, the driving forces invert. Amphiphiles will minimize exposure of polar headgroups to the nonpolar solvent and maximize exposure of nonpolar tails. Therefore, the most stable membrane structure is an inverted bilayer (also called a reverse bilayer), in which nonpolar tails face outward toward the nonpolar solvent on both sides, while polar headgroups are sequestered in the interior of the bilayer, possibly forming a polar core stabilized by headgroup-headgroup interactions, internal hydrogen bonding, or enclosed polar microenvironments.\n\nFor soluble proteins in a nonpolar cytoplasm, the fold likewise inverts relative to aqueous folding. Exposure of polar and charged residues to a nonpolar solvent is unfavorable; thus, polar/charged residues are buried in the interior where they can form internal hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and dipolar networks, while nonpolar residues are preferentially exposed on the surface to interact favorably with the nonpolar solvent via dispersion forces. This corresponds to an inside-out fold relative to terrestrial proteins in water.\n\nI now evaluate the options against these principles:\n\n- Option A proposes a standard bilayer and aqueous-style protein folding. This exposes polar lipid headgroups and polar/charged protein residues to a nonpolar solvent, which is unfavorable. Reject A.\n\n- Option B proposes an inverted bilayer (plausible) but keeps aqueous-style protein folding with nonpolar cores and polar surfaces, which is unfavorable in a nonpolar solvent. Reject B.\n\n- Option C proposes an inverted bilayer and inside-out protein folding, with polar/charged residues in the core and nonpolar residues on the surface. This matches the solvation and self-assembly expectations in a nonpolar medium. Accept C.\n\n- Option D proposes a standard bilayer (unfavorable) but inside-out protein folding (favorable). The membrane part is inconsistent with a nonpolar solvent. Reject D.\n\n- Option E proposes a monolayer of nonpolar molecules and unfolded proteins. While nonpolar environments can support stable tertiary structures by burying polar residues and exposing nonpolar ones, this option incorrectly asserts that proteins must be unfolded. Moreover, a simple nonpolar monolayer does not address the need to sequester polar headgroups or create polar microenvironments; inverted bilayers or reverse micelles are more plausible. Reject E.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible molecular architecture is an inverted bilayer with nonpolar tails facing the methane solvent and polar headgroups sequestered, and soluble proteins adopting an inside-out fold with polar/charged residues in the core and nonpolar residues on the surface, as described in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2294153"}]}
