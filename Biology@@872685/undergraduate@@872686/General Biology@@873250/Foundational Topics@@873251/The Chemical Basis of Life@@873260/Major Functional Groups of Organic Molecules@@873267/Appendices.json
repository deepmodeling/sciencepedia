The capacity factor is $k=K\\frac{V_{s}}{V_{m}}$, so more hydrophobic analytes (larger $K$) have larger $k$ and therefore longer retention times.

These are inactive molecules that are transformed into active drugs inside the body, often to overcome barriers like the blood-brain barrier. This problem places you in the role of a medicinal chemist tasked with making a polar drug more lipophilic to reach its target in the brain, a classic challenge that highlights the practical power of understanding functional group properties. [@problem_id:2301496]", "problem": "A team of neuropharmacologists is designing a new drug candidate to treat a CNS disorder. The active molecule is a small, polar organic compound containing two key functional groups on an aromatic ring system: a catechol group (two hydroxyl groups at adjacent positions) and a primary amine group ($-\\text{NH}_2$). In vitro studies confirmed that the two hydroxyl groups of the catechol moiety are absolutely essential for high-affinity binding to the target receptor via hydrogen bonding. However, the drug exhibits poor therapeutic efficacy in vivo due to its high polarity, which prevents it from passively diffusing across the lipid-rich Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB).\n\nTo overcome this limitation, the team decides to create a prodrug: a bioreversible, chemically modified version of the drug that is more lipophilic. This prodrug is designed to be pharmacologically inactive, capable of crossing the BBB, and then being enzymatically converted back to the active parent drug within the brain.\n\nGiven the structural requirements, which one of the following chemical modifications represents the most effective and common strategy to create such a prodrug?\n\nA. Conversion of the primary amine to a quaternary ammonium salt by exhaustive methylation.\n\nB. Sulfonation of the aromatic ring to introduce a sulfonic acid group ($-\\text{SO}_3\\text{H}$).\n\nC. Methylation of only one of the catechol's hydroxyl groups to form a guaiacol-type ether.\n\nD. Glycosylation by attaching a glucose molecule to one of the hydroxyl groups.\n\nE. Conversion of the primary amine to a primary amide by reaction with acetic anhydride.\n\nF. Esterification of both catechol hydroxyl groups by reacting them with pivaloyl chloride.", "solution": "The design objective is to increase passive BBB permeability while ensuring bioreversible conversion to the active parent once in the brain. The BBB favors molecules that are neutral, lipophilic, with low polar surface area and minimal hydrogen bond donors. The parent drug contains a catechol (two phenolic hydroxyls) and a primary amine, making it highly polar and hydrogen-bonding, which impedes BBB penetration.\n\nA valid prodrug strategy should:\n1) Mask key polar functionalities to reduce hydrogen bond donation/acceptance and increase lipophilicity.\n2) Be pharmacologically inactive when masked (here, blocking the catechol hydroxyls would abolish essential receptor hydrogen bonds).\n3) Undergo predictable, efficient enzymatic cleavage in the brain (e.g., by esterases) to regenerate the active catechol and amine.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\nA. Quaternary ammonium formation creates a permanent positive charge, markedly increasing polarity and preventing BBB penetration. It is not a bioreversible masking of polarity and is counterproductive.\n\nB. Sulfonation to introduce a sulfonic acid group yields a strong acid that is largely ionized at physiological pH, drastically increasing polarity and preventing BBB crossing; it is not a typical prodrug handle for bioreversible unmasking.\n\nC. Methylation of one phenolic hydroxyl to a methyl ether moderately reduces polarity but leaves the other hydroxyl and the amine, so BBB permeability remains poor. More importantly, aryl methyl ethers are not reliably and efficiently cleaved in vivo as a prodrug strategy; O-demethylation is oxidative and not a common, predictable unmasking route for CNS prodrugs.\n\nD. Glycosylation increases molecular size and polarity and generally reduces passive BBB diffusion. Although glucose transporters exist at the BBB, glycosylated drugs typically do not serve as effective prodrugs for CNS penetration due to steric and transporter-substrate specificity constraints; this is not a common strategy for CNS delivery.\n\nE. Converting the primary amine to an amide reduces basicity and polarity somewhat, but leaves both catechol hydroxyls unmasked, so the molecule remains highly polar and hydrogen-bonding. Moreover, amide hydrolysis, especially for aryl-adjacent amides, can be slow and unreliable for prodrug activation in the brain. It does not address the principal polarity contributors (the catechol).\n\nF. Esterifying both catechol hydroxyls to form diesters (e.g., dipivaloyl esters) masks the two key hydrogen-bond donor/acceptor sites, substantially increasing lipophilicity and reducing polarity. This abolishes hydrogen bonding to the receptor (rendering the prodrug inactive) and facilitates BBB penetration. Once in the brain, ubiquitous esterases can efficiently hydrolyze the esters to regenerate the active catechol. This is a well-precedented, effective, and common bioreversible prodrug strategy (e.g., dipivalyl phenolic prodrugs such as dipivefrin).\n\nTherefore, the most effective and common strategy here is to mask both catechol hydroxyl groups as lipophilic, enzymatically cleavable esters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{F}$$", "id": "2301496"}]}
