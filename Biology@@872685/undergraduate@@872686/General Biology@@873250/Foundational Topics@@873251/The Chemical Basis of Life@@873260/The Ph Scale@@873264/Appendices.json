During fermentation, these bacteria convert lactose, the sugar in milk, into lactic acid. This process increases the acidity of the milk, causing the milk proteins to denature and coagulate, which gives yogurt its characteristic thick texture. A food scientist is monitoring a batch of yogurt fermentation. The process is known to be self-limiting; as the concentration of lactic acid increases, the environment becomes too acidic for the bacteria to survive and metabolize efficiently. The scientist observes that the fermentation process effectively halts when the pH of the yogurt mixture reaches a value of 4.35.\n\nCalculate the molar concentration of hydrogen ions, $[H^+]$, in the yogurt when the fermentation stops.
