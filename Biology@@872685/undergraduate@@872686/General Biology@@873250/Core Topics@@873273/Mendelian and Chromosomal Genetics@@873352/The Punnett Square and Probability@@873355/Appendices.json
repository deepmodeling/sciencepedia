Its value is determined by two specific genetic traits: petal color and fragrance. The gene for petal color has two alleles: a dominant allele $B$ which codes for vibrant blue petals, and a recessive allele $b$ which codes for plain white petals. The gene for fragrance also has two alleles: a dominant allele $S$ which produces a distinct, sweet scent, and a recessive allele $s$ which results in an unscented flower.\n\nThese two genes are located on different, non-homologous chromosomes, and therefore they assort independently during meiosis. A horticulturalist performs a dihybrid cross between two parent Stardust Lily plants. Both parent plants are heterozygous for both the petal color and fragrance genes.\n\nCalculate the probability that any single offspring from this cross will exhibit both dominant phenotypes, meaning it will have blue petals and a sweet scent. Express your answer as a simplified fraction.", "solution": "Let the two genes be color with alleles $B$ (dominant, blue) and $b$ (recessive, white), and fragrance with alleles $S$ (dominant, sweet) and $s$ (recessive, unscented). Each parent is heterozygous for both genes, so each parent has genotype $BbSs$. By Mendel’s law of segregation, at each locus a parent transmits one of its two alleles with equal probability. By Mendel’s law of independent assortment (the genes are on different, non-homologous chromosomes), transmission at the two loci is independent. Therefore, the gametes from each parent are $BS$, $Bs$, $bS$, and $bs$, each with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nFirst consider a single locus. For a monohybrid cross $Bb \\times Bb$, the offspring genotypes are $BB$, $Bb$, $bB$, and $bb$ with probabilities $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The dominant phenotype (blue) occurs for genotypes $BB$, $Bb$, or $bB$, giving\n$$\nP(\\text{blue})=1-P(bb)=1-\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{3}{4}.\n$$\nSimilarly, for the fragrance locus $Ss \\times Ss$, the dominant phenotype (sweet scent) occurs with probability\n$$\nP(\\text{sweet})=1-P(ss)=1-\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{3}{4}.\n$$\nBecause the loci assort independently, the probability of exhibiting both dominant phenotypes is the product of the independent probabilities:\n$$\nP(\\text{blue and sweet})=P(\\text{blue})\\cdot P(\\text{sweet})=\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot \\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{9}{16}.\n$$\nThus, the probability that an offspring has blue petals and a sweet scent is $\\frac{9}{16}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{9}{16}}$$", "id": "2322976"}, {"introduction": "While predicting future outcomes is a core skill, genetic analysis often involves working backward from observed results.

The allele for a deep purple color, denoted by $P$, is dominant over the allele for a rare, vibrant blue color, denoted by $p$. A botanist performs a cross between two Starlight Orchids that are both heterozygous for the petal color gene.

Express your answer as a simplified fraction.", "solution": "This problem can be solved in two main steps. First, we must determine the probability of a single offspring from this cross having the blue petal phenotype. Second, we must use this probability to calculate the probability of observing exactly two blue-petaled plants in a group of five.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the probability for a single offspring.**\n\nThe parental cross is between two heterozygous plants, whose genotype is $Pp$. We can use a Punnett square to determine the possible genotypes and their probabilities for any single offspring.\n\nThe cross is $Pp \\times Pp$.\n\n| | P | p |\n| :---: | :-: | :-: |\n| **P** | PP | Pp |\n| **p** | Pp | pp |\n\nFrom the Punnett square, the possible genotypes for an offspring are $PP$, $Pp$, and $pp$.

The purple petal color is dominant ($P$), so plants with genotypes $PP$ or $Pp$ will have purple petals. The blue petal color is recessive ($p$), so only plants with the genotype $pp$ will have blue petals.\n\nThe probability of an offspring having blue petals (genotype $pp$) is therefore $\\frac{1}{4}$.\nLet's define this probability as $p_{\\text{success}}$. So, $p_{\\text{success}} = P(\\text{blue}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe probability of an offspring *not* having blue petals (i.e., having purple petals, genotypes $PP$ or $Pp$) is $1 - p_{\\text{success}}$.\n$P(\\text{purple}) = P(PP) + P(Pp) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nSo, $p_{\\text{failure}} = P(\\text{purple}) = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the binomial probability formula.**\n\nWe are interested in the probability of a specific outcome (exactly 2 blue plants) in a fixed number of independent trials (5 plants). This scenario is described by the binomial probability distribution. The formula for the binomial probability is:\n$$ P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $$\nWhere:\n- $n$ is the total number of trials (the number of plants), which is 5.\n- $k$ is the number of successful outcomes (the number of blue-petaled plants), which is 2.\n- $p$ is the probability of a single success (a plant being blue), which is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n- $(1-p)$ is the probability of a single failure (a plant being purple), which is $\\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nNow we substitute our values into the formula:\n$$ P(X=2) = \\binom{5}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{5-2} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$:\n$$ \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(2 \\times 1)(3 \\times 2 \\times 1)} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the probability terms:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1^2}{4^2} = \\frac{1}{16} $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{5-2} = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^3 = \\frac{3^3}{4^3} = \\frac{27}{64} $$\n\nFinally, we multiply all the parts together to find the total probability:\n$$ P(X=2) = 10 \\times \\frac{1}{16} \\times \\frac{27}{64} = \\frac{270}{1024} $$\n\nThe last step is to simplify the fraction.
