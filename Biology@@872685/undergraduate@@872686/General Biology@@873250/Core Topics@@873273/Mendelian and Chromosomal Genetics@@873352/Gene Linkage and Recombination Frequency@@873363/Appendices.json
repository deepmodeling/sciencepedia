This exercise provides a classic scenario where you will analyze the progeny from such a cross to calculate the recombination frequency, a direct measure of how often two genes are separated during meiosis. This practice is essential for mastering the fundamental link between phenotypic ratios and the underlying chromosomal events [@problem_id:2296460].", "problem": "A geneticist is studying the inheritance of two traits in a species of bioluminescent beetle, *Photinus fictus*. The first gene controls antenna length, where the allele for long antennas ($A$) is dominant to the allele for short antennas ($a$). The second gene controls the color of the beetle's glow, where the allele for a green glow ($G$) is dominant to the allele for a blue glow ($g$).\n\nTo investigate the linkage between these two genes, the geneticist performs a series of crosses.

To build a comprehensive genetic map, we use a three-point test cross, a more powerful tool that allows us to deduce gene order and map distances simultaneously. The key insight comes from identifying the rarest offspring classes, which result from double-crossover events and reveal the gene located in the middle. This problem challenges you to work through the data from a three-point cross, first deducing the gene order and then calculating the map distance between the two outer genes, mimicking the complete analytical process of a geneticist [@problem_id:2296477].", "problem": "In a species of ornamental orchid, three genes located on the same chromosome control distinct traits: flower color (alleles `P` for purple and `p` for white), leaf shape (alleles `S` for smooth and `s` for wrinkled), and stem texture (alleles `H` for hairy and `h` for glabrous). In each case, the uppercase allele is dominant over the lowercase allele.\n\nAn orchid plant that is heterozygous for all three genes is subjected to a test cross with a plant that is homozygous recessive for all three genes.
