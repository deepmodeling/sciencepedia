The foundation of linkage analysis lies in distinguishing parental allele combinations from new, recombinant combinations. This first exercise provides data from a test cross and challenges you to work backward to deduce the original parental genotypes, a key skill for understanding how allele arrangements on chromosomes are transmitted through generations [@problem_id:2286680].", "problem": "A geneticist is studying the inheritance of two traits in the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*: body color and wing shape. The gene for body color has a dominant allele `B` for a grey body and a recessive allele `b` for a black body. The gene for wing shape has a dominant allele `V` for normal wings and a recessive allele `v` for vestigial wings.\n\nThe experiment begins by crossing two different true-breeding (homozygous) parental fly strains (P generation). All flies in the resulting F1 generation exhibit a grey body and normal wings.\n\nNext, an F1 female is subjected to a test cross with a male fly that has a black body and vestigial wings. The phenotypes of 1000 offspring from this test cross were recorded as follows:\n- Grey body, normal wings: 98\n- Black body, vestigial wings: 102\n- Grey body, vestigial wings: 404\n- Black body, normal wings: 396\n\nBased on these results, what were the genotypes of the two original true-breeding parental (P generation) strains?\n\nA. `BBVV` and `bbvv`\n\nB. `BBvv` and `bbVV`\n\nC. `BbVv` and `BbVv`\n\nD. `BBVV` and `BBvv`\n\nE. `bbvv` and `bbVV`", "solution": "Both traits show complete dominance: $B$ (grey) over $b$ (black) and $V$ (normal) over $v$ (vestigial). All F1 flies are grey with normal wings, and the test cross yields all four phenotypic classes, so the F1 must be a double heterozygote $BbVv$.\n\nIn a test cross $BbVv \\times bbvv$, each offspring phenotype reveals directly the gamete from the F1 female. The two most frequent classes are the nonrecombinant (parental) gametes; the two least frequent are recombinants. From the data: grey vestigial ($Bv$) are $404$ and black normal ($bV$) are $396$, which are the largest classes, while grey normal ($BV$) are $98$ and black vestigial ($bv$) are $102$, which are the smallest. Therefore, the F1 female’s coupling phase is $Bv \\,/\\, bV$, meaning her two homologous chromosomes carry $Bv$ and $bV$.\n\nSince the F1 arose from crossing two homozygous true-breeding parents, each parental strain contributed one of these haplotypes exclusively. Thus one parent must have been $BBvv$ (producing only $Bv$ gametes) and the other $bbVV$ (producing only $bV$ gametes). This corresponds to option B.

The two most frequent classes are nonrecombinant (parental), and the two least frequent classes are double crossovers (DCO). The gene order is determined by comparing parental and DCO classes: the gene whose allele is switched relative to the outer two is in the middle. Map distances (in map units, m.u.) are computed as the recombination fraction in each interval multiplied by 100, where the recombination fraction for an interval equals the number of single crossovers in that interval plus the DCOs, all divided by the total progeny.\n\nFrom the data, the two most frequent classes are low lipid, low sugar, low strength ($l\\,s\\,f$, count $755$) and high lipid, high sugar, high strength ($L\\,S\\,F$, count $765$), which are the parental types.

The proposed map is that the gene order is `p - f - s`, with a map distance of 10.0 centiMorgans (cM) between genes `p` and `f`, and 20.0 cM between genes `f` and `s`. The geneticist also hypothesizes that there is genetic interference with a coefficient of interference (`I`) equal to 0.4.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, a plant that is heterozygous for all three genes is generated from a cross between a true-breeding purple, smooth, axial plant and a true-breeding white, hairy, terminal plant.
