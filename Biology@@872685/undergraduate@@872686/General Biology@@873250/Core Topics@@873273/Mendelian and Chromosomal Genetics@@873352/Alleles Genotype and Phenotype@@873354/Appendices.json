This practice exercise [@problem_id:2276521] walks you through a classic monohybrid cross, starting from pure-breeding parents to the F2 generation. By calculating the expected number of heterozygous offspring, you will apply the core concepts of dominance and the law of segregation to connect parental genotypes to progeny ratios.", "problem": "In a particular species of cellular slime mold, the color of the mature fruiting body is governed by a single gene with two alleles. The allele for a yellow fruiting body, denoted by $Y$, is completely dominant over the allele for a white fruiting body, denoted by $y$.\n\nA geneticist initiates an experiment by crossing a slime mold from a pure-breeding (homozygous) yellow-bodied population with a slime mold from a pure-breeding white-bodied population. The resulting offspring constitute the F1 generation. Following this, two randomly selected individuals from the F1 generation are crossed to produce an F2 generation, which consists of a total of 852 individual slime molds.\n\nAssuming the cross follows standard Mendelian inheritance patterns and there are no other influencing factors, what is the expected number of individuals in the F2 generation that will be heterozygous for the fruiting body color gene?", "solution": "Let the alleles be $Y$ (dominant) and $y$ (recessive). A pure-breeding yellow individual has genotype $YY$, and a pure-breeding white individual has genotype $yy$.\n\nStep 1: Parental cross. Crossing $YY \\times yy$, the $YY$ parent produces only $Y$ gametes and the $yy$ parent produces only $y$ gametes. Therefore, all F1 offspring receive $Y$ from one parent and $y$ from the other, yielding\n$$\n\\text{F1 genotypes: } Yy \\quad \\text{with probability } 1.\n$$\n\nStep 2: F1 intercross. Two randomly selected F1 individuals are both $Yy$, so the cross is $Yy \\times Yy$. By Mendel’s law of segregation, each $Yy$ produces gametes $Y$ and $y$ with probabilities $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{2}$, respectively. The F2 genotype probabilities are\n$$\nP(YY) = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}, \\quad\nP(Yy) = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad\nP(yy) = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\n\nStep 3: Expected number of heterozygotes in F2.

This problem [@problem_id:2276546] explores epistasis, a common form of gene interaction where one gene masks the phenotypic effect of another. By analyzing a dihybrid cross in a bioluminescent fungus, you'll see how a genetic pathway can create non-standard phenotypic ratios, deepening your understanding of how genotypes are translated into observable traits.", "problem": "In a species of bioluminescent mycelial fungus found in deep caves, two independently assorting genes control the organism's glowing characteristics. The first gene determines whether the fungus produces light, with the allele for luminescence $L$ being dominant over the non-luminescent allele $l$. The second gene determines the color of the light produced, with the allele for blue light $B$ being dominant over the allele for green light $b$.\n\nThe expression of the color gene is an example of epistasis: a fungus with the genotype $ll$ will not produce any light, regardless of the alleles present for the color gene. Its phenotype is simply \"dark\". A fungus must have at least one $L$ allele to produce light, the color of which is then determined by the $B/b$ gene.\n\nA fungal colony with the genotype $LlBb$ is crossed with a colony that has the genotype $Llbb$. Assuming all spores produced from this cross are viable, what is the probability that a randomly selected spore will grow into a fungus that produces green light?\n\nExpress your answer as a fraction in simplest form.", "solution": "The traits are determined by two independently assorting loci. For luminescence, $L$ is dominant to $l$, so a fungus produces light if and only if its $L$-locus genotype is $LL$ or $Ll$; genotype $ll$ yields the epistatic dark phenotype regardless of the color locus. For color, $B$ is dominant to $b$, so among light-producing genotypes, $B\\_$ gives blue and $bb$ gives green.\n\nThe cross is $LlBb \\times Llbb$. By Mendel’s law of segregation at the $L$ locus, $Ll \\times Ll$ produces offspring genotypes with probabilities\n$$\nP(LL)=\\frac{1}{4},\\quad P(Ll)=\\frac{1}{2},\\quad P(ll)=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nThus the probability an offspring is light-capable is\n$$\nP(L\\_)=P(LL\\ \\text{or}\\ Ll)=\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{3}{4}.\n$$\nAt the color locus, $Bb \\times bb$ yields\n$$\nP(Bb)=\\frac{1}{2},\\quad P(bb)=\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nBy independent assortment, the $L$-locus and $B$-locus outcomes are independent.
