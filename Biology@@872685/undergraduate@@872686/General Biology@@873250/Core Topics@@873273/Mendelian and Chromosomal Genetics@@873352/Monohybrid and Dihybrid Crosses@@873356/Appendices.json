Two specific traits are of interest: flower color and plant height. The gene for flower color has two alleles: a dominant allele $A$ for purple flowers and a recessive allele $a$ for white flowers. The gene for plant height also has two alleles: a dominant allele $B$ for tall plants and a recessive allele $b$ for dwarf plants. These two genes are located on different chromosomes and therefore assort independently according to Mendelian genetics.\n\nThe scientist performs a cross between two parent plants. Parent 1 has the genotype $AaBb$. Parent 2 has the genotype $Aabb$.\n\nCalculate the probability of obtaining an offspring from this cross that has purple flowers and is of dwarf height.

The parental cross is between an individual with genotype $AaBb$ and an individual with genotype $Aabb$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the genotypes that correspond to the desired phenotypes.\n- For flower color, purple is the dominant trait. Therefore, an offspring with purple flowers can have a genotype of either $AA$ or $Aa$.\n- For plant height, dwarf is the recessive trait. Therefore, an offspring that is dwarf must have the genotype $bb$.\n\nThe problem states that the two genes assort independently. This means we can consider the inheritance of each gene separately and then combine the probabilities using the product rule.\n\nLet's analyze the monohybrid cross for the flower color gene (gene $A$).\nThe cross for this gene is $Aa \\times Aa$.\nThe possible gametes from each parent are $A$ and $a$, each with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nWe can use a Punnett square to find the probabilities of the offspring genotypes:\n\n| | $A$ | $a$ |\n| :---: | :-: | :-: |\n| **$A$** | $AA$| $Aa$|\n| **$a$** | $Aa$| $aa$|\n\nFrom the Punnett square, the probabilities of the offspring genotypes are:\n- P($AA$) = $\\frac{1}{4}$\n- P($Aa$) = $\\frac{1}{2}$\n- P($aa$) = $\\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThe probability of an offspring having purple flowers is the probability of it having either the $AA$ or $Aa$ genotype.\nP(purple flowers) = P($AA$) + P($Aa$) = $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nNext, let's analyze the monohybrid cross for the plant height gene (gene $B$).\nThe cross for this gene is $Bb \\times bb$.\nThe parent with genotype $Bb$ produces two types of gametes, $B$ and $b$, each with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe parent with genotype $bb$ produces only one type of gamete, $b$, with a probability of 1.\nThe Punnett square for this cross is:\n\n| | $b$ |\n| :---: | :-: |\n| **$B$** | $Bb$|\n| **$b$** | $bb$|\n\nFrom this, the probabilities of the offspring genotypes are:\n- P($Bb$) = $\\frac{1}{2}$\n- P($bb$) = $\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThe problem asks for an offspring of dwarf height, which corresponds to the genotype $bb$.\nP(dwarf height) = P($bb$) = $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFinally, to find the probability of an offspring having both purple flowers and dwarf height, we use the product rule for independent events:\nP(purple and dwarf) = P(purple flowers) $\\times$ P(dwarf height)\nP(purple and dwarf) = $\\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{8}$.\n\nThus, the probability of obtaining an offspring with purple flowers and dwarf height from this cross is $\\frac{3}{8}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$$", "id": "2304194"}, {"introduction": "This problem moves beyond simple dominance to explore epistasis, where one gene masks the expression of another at a different locus.
