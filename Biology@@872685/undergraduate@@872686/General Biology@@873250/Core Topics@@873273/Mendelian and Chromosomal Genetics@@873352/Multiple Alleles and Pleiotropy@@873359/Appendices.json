This gene exhibits a phenomenon known as pleiotropy, as it also influences the fish's stress response behavior. Through extensive population analysis, the researchers have identified that the *Chroma* locus exists in 7 distinct allelic forms in the wild.

By applying the rules of gametophytic self-incompatibility, you can predict the specific outcomes of a cross, gaining insight into how these systems promote genetic diversity [@problem_id:2304371].", "problem": "In a species of ornamental cherry tree, a single gene locus, known as the S-locus, controls two distinct traits.

This final practice presents a classic puzzle involving the human ABO blood group system, the archetypal example of multiple alleles. When a pedigree appears to violate Mendelian rules, it often points to a deeper genetic principle at play, such as the epistatic interaction that causes the Bombay phenotype. Solving this problem requires you to act as a genetic detective, using your knowledge of both multiple alleles and gene interactions to deduce the correct parental genotypes [@problem_id:2304377].", "problem": "In human genetics, the ABO blood group is determined by a gene, designated as the I locus, which has three common alleles: $I^A$, $I^B$, and $i$. The alleles $I^A$ and $I^B$ are codominant, and both are completely dominant over the recessive allele $i$. The expression of the ABO blood group is controlled by a separate, unlinked gene known as the H locus. The dominant allele, $H$, codes for an enzyme that produces a precursor substance (Substance H) on the surface of red blood cells. The enzymes encoded by $I^A$ and $I^B$ modify this Substance H to produce A and B antigens, respectively. The recessive allele $i$ produces no functional enzyme.\n\nIndividuals with the homozygous recessive genotype, $hh$, cannot produce Substance H. Consequently, even if they possess the $I^A$ or $I^B$ alleles, they cannot produce A or B antigens. Their red blood cells lack A, B, and H antigens, causing them to test as blood type O. This epistatic interaction, where the $hh$ genotype masks the expression of the I locus alleles, is known as the Bombay phenotype.\n\nConsider a large family where the parental couple, a phenotypically normal man and woman, have had many children. A comprehensive genetic analysis of their offspring reveals the presence of children with all four standard ABO blood types (A, B, AB, and O), as well as at least one child with the rare Bombay phenotype.\n\nBased on this complete family history, determine the full genotypes of the two parents at both the I locus and the H locus. Choose the correct pair of parental genotypes from the options below. The order of the two parental genotypes does not matter.\n\nA. $I^A i Hh$ and $I^B i Hh$\n\nB. $I^A I^A Hh$ and $I^B i Hh$\n\nC. $I^A i HH$ and $I^B i HH$\n\nD. $I^A I^B Hh$ and $ii Hh$\n\nE. $I^A i Hh$ and $I^A i Hh$", "solution": "We use the two-locus model with independent assortment: the ABO I locus with alleles $I^{A}$, $I^{B}$ (codominant) and $i$ (recessive), and the H locus with alleles $H$ (dominant, required for Substance H) and $h$ (recessive null). Expression of A or B antigens requires at least one $H$ allele; the genotype $hh$ is epistatic and yields the Bombay phenotype, phenotypically O regardless of the I-locus genotype.\n\nFrom the family data:\n1) Presence of at least one Bombay child implies both parents must carry $h$ but are phenotypically normal. Therefore both parents must be $Hh$. Indeed, if either parent were $HH$, no child could be $hh$, and if either were $hh$, that parent would be Bombay, contradicting the description. Thus both parents are $Hh$, giving $\\Pr(hh)=\\frac{1}{4}$ among offspring.\n\n2) Presence of children with all four standard ABO blood types (A, B, AB, O) among phenotypically normal children requires that, among children who inherit at least one $H$ allele (i.e., $HH$ or $Hh$), the I-locus segregation produce all four genotypes $I^{A}I^{B}$ (AB), $I^{A}i$ (A), $I^{B}i$ (B), and $ii$ (O).
