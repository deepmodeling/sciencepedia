This practice problem challenges you to work backward from a known diagnosis—monosomy 21—to pinpoint the specific errors in oogenesis that could be responsible [@problem_id:2299658]. By analyzing the genetic content of the polar bodies, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the mechanics of meiotic nondisjunction and its diagnostic signatures.", "problem": "In human females, oogenesis begins before birth but arrests in prophase I. Following puberty, a primary oocyte completes meiosis I to produce a large secondary oocyte and a small first polar body (PB1). The secondary oocyte then arrests in metaphase II and is ovulated. If fertilization occurs, it completes meiosis II, yielding a fertilized ovum and a second polar body (PB2).\n\nConsider a case where preimplantation genetic diagnosis reveals that a zygote has monosomy 21, meaning it possesses only one copy of chromosome 21. This condition is known to have resulted from an error during the oogenesis that produced the ovum; the fertilizing sperm was genetically normal, carrying one copy of every chromosome, including chromosome 21.\n\nWhich of the following scenarios, describing the number of copies of chromosome 21 found in the polar bodies from that specific oogenesis event, could correctly account for the formation of the monosomic zygote? Note that there may be more than one correct option.\n\nA. PB1 contains one copy of chromosome 21; PB2 contains one copy of chromosome 21.\n\nB. PB1 contains two copies of chromosome 21; PB2 contains zero copies of chromosome 21.\n\nC. PB1 contains one copy of chromosome 21; PB2 contains two copies of chromosome 21.\n\nD. PB1 contains zero copies of chromosome 21; PB2 contains one copy of chromosome 21.\n\nE. PB1 contains zero copies of chromosome 21; PB2 contains zero copies of chromosome 21.", "solution": "We are told the sperm is normal (one copy of each chromosome, including chromosome 21), but the zygote is monosomic for chromosome 21. Therefore, the ovum must have contributed zero copies of chromosome 21. The oocyte must thus have ended meiosis II with no chromosome 21.\n\nKey meiotic principles:\n- Meiosis I (MI) separates homologous chromosomes; an MI nondisjunction sends both homologs to the same daughter cell and leaves the other daughter with none.\n- Meiosis II (MII) separates sister chromatids; an MII nondisjunction sends both sister chromatids of a homolog to the same daughter cell and leaves the other with none.\n- PB1 is the product of MI; PB2 is the product of the MII division of the secondary oocyte.\n\nWe need polar body patterns that are consistent with an ovum having zero chromosome 21.\n\nScenario 1 (MI nondisjunction causing a nullisomic secondary oocyte):\n- In MI, both homologs of chromosome 21 go to PB1, leaving the secondary oocyte with none.\n- Consequently, PB1 contains two copies of chromosome 21, the secondary oocyte contains zero.\n- In MII, because the secondary oocyte has no chromosome 21, PB2 receives zero and the ovum also receives zero.\n- Fertilization by a normal sperm then yields a monosomic zygote.\n- This matches option B: PB1 two copies; PB2 zero copies.\n\nScenario 2 (MI normal, MII nondisjunction in the secondary oocyte leading to loss from the ovum):\n- In MI, homologs segregate normally: PB1 receives one homolog (one copy), the secondary oocyte receives the other homolog (one copy).\n- In MII, nondisjunction of the sister chromatids in the secondary oocyte sends both sister chromatids of chromosome 21 into PB2, leaving the ovum with zero.\n- Thus PB1 contains one copy; PB2 contains two copies; the ovum contains zero.\n- Fertilization by a normal sperm yields a monosomic zygote.\n- This matches option C: PB1 one copy; PB2 two copies.\n\nExclusions:\n- A (PB1 one; PB2 one) corresponds to entirely normal segregation; the ovum would have one copy, producing a disomic (normal) zygote.\n- D (PB1 zero; PB2 one) arises from MI nondisjunction sending both homologs to the oocyte, followed by normal MII that gives one copy to PB2 and one to the ovum; the ovum would have one copy, yielding a disomic zygote.\n- E (PB1 zero; PB2 zero) would require both homologs to the oocyte in MI and then MII sending both sister chromatids to the ovum (PB2 zero), which gives the ovum two copies and leads to a trisomic zygote, not monosomy.\n\nTherefore, the correct scenarios are B and C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BC}$$", "id": "2299658"}, {"introduction": "While changes in chromosome number are significant, alterations in chromosome structure are equally important.
