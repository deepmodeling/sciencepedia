Through initial characterization, it was determined that the enzyme exhibits maximal activity at a highly specific pH of 4.5. The catalytic mechanism of Catalyzin depends critically on the ionization states of two amino acid residues within its active site: an Aspartate (Asp) residue and a Glutamate (Glu) residue. The side chain of the Aspartate has a pKa of 3.8, and the side chain of the Glutamate has a pKa of 5.2. For catalysis to occur, the Aspartate residue must be deprotonated to function as a general base, while the Glutamate residue must be protonated to function as a general acid.\n\nA graduate student sets up a series of experiments to measure the enzyme's kinetics.
