A mature descendant of the host cell is found to contain $N=1250$ mitochondria.\n\nAssume that the rate of metabolic energy production is directly proportional to the membrane surface area where the reactions take place. For the original host, this is its outer surface. For the final cell, the total metabolic surface area is the sum of the host's outer surface area and the surface areas of all its internal mitochondria.
