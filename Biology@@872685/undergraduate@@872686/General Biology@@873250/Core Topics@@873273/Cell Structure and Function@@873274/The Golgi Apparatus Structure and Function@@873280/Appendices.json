{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To understand the intricate pathways within a cell, scientists often need to observe processes as they happen. This exercise introduces a classic experimental technique known as a \"pulse-chase,\" which uses a temperature-sensitive protein to synchronize the movement of cargo through the secretory pathway. By applying your knowledge of the route from the Endoplasmic Reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, you can predict the location of a wave of fluorescently tagged proteins at a specific time point, much like tracking a package through a mail distribution center [@problem_id:2339256].", "problem": "A cell biology research group is investigating the dynamics of protein transport through the secretory pathway. They have engineered a cell line to express a special fusion protein: a temperature-sensitive mutant of the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus glycoprotein (ts-VSV-G) tagged with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP).\n\nThis ts-VSV-G protein has a specific property:\n- At a high, \"restrictive\" temperature of 40°C, the protein misfolds and is retained by the quality control machinery within the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER).\n- At a lower, \"permissive\" temperature of 32°C, the protein folds correctly, allowing it to exit the ER and proceed through the secretory pathway.\n\nThe experiment is conducted as follows:\n1. The cells are incubated at the restrictive temperature (40°C) for several hours to cause a large accumulation of the ts-VSV-G-GFP protein throughout the ER network.\n2. At time $t=0$, the cell culture medium is replaced with fresh medium containing cycloheximide (a drug that halts all new protein synthesis), and the temperature is simultaneously shifted to the permissive temperature (32°C). This initiates a synchronized \"pulse\" of pre-existing, fluorescently-tagged protein transport.\n\nBased on the established model of anterograde (forward) protein transport, which of the following describes the most likely predominant subcellular localization of the GFP signal at a short time point after the shift, specifically at $t = 7$ minutes?\n\nA. Evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm.\n\nB. Concentrated at the trans-face of the Golgi apparatus and in secretory vesicles budding from it.\n\nC. Remaining entirely within the Endoplasmic Reticulum.\n\nD. Primarily localized to the cis-face of the Golgi apparatus.\n\nE. Accumulated on the exterior of the plasma membrane.", "solution": "We apply the established sequence of anterograde transport in the secretory pathway: properly folded secretory membrane proteins exit the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) in COPII-coated carriers at ER exit sites, then traverse the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) to reach the cis-face of the Golgi apparatus, subsequently progressing through medial and trans cisternae to the trans-Golgi network and finally to secretory vesicles and the plasma membrane.\n\nGiven the properties of the engineered protein and the experimental design:\n1. At the restrictive temperature, the ts-VSV-G-GFP misfolds and is retained within the ER by quality control, causing accumulation throughout the ER.\n2. At $t=0$, the shift to the permissive temperature allows the accumulated pool to fold correctly. Cycloheximide simultaneously halts new protein synthesis, ensuring that only the pre-existing pool proceeds; this does not prevent trafficking of the existing pool.\n3. After permissive folding, export from the ER begins rapidly as COPII vesicles bud from ER exit sites. This early stage occurs within minutes and leads to delivery to the ERGIC and then the cis-Golgi.\n4. Progression to the trans-face of the Golgi and formation of secretory vesicles budding from it occurs later, typically on the order of tens of minutes after ER exit. Arrival at the plasma membrane occurs still later.\n5. Therefore, at an early time point such as $t=7$ minutes, the predominant localization is expected to be at early Golgi entry compartments: ERGIC and the cis-face of the Golgi. It would not yet be concentrated at the trans-face or the plasma membrane, and it would not remain entirely in the ER because exit initiates promptly upon folding. It would also not be evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm because trafficking is along defined membrane-bound compartments.\n\nAmong the provided options, the description that best matches the expected predominant localization at $t=7$ minutes is the cis-face of the Golgi apparatus.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2339256"}, {"introduction": "Scientific models, like the cisternal maturation model for Golgi transport, are powerful frameworks for explaining complex biological phenomena. However, for a model to be viable, it must be consistent with the physical and kinetic realities of the cell. This problem challenges you to become a cellular detective, using hypothetical but realistic biophysical data to perform a calculation [@problem_id:2339307]. By determining if retrograde transport is fast enough to keep pace with cisternal progression, you can critically evaluate the model's plausibility and appreciate how quantitative reasoning is used to refine our understanding of cellular mechanics.", "problem": "The mechanism of protein and lipid transport through the Golgi apparatus remains a topic of active research. One leading model, the cisternal maturation model, proposes that the Golgi cisternae themselves are dynamic structures that progress from the *cis* to the *trans* face of the stack, maturing in enzymatic content as they move. In this model, luminal cargo is carried forward with the moving cisterna, while Golgi-resident enzymes are maintained in their specific compartments by being selectively captured into vesicles and transported in the retrograde direction (from a later cisterna to an earlier one).\n\nConsider a hypothetical, highly active secretory cell being studied. Live-cell imaging provides the following data:\n1.  Large, fluorescently-tagged procollagen aggregates, which are too large for standard transport vesicles, are observed to traverse the entire length of the Golgi stack, $L = 140$ nm, in an average time of $T_{transit} = 49$ seconds.\n2.  The Golgi stack in this cell is composed of $N_{cis} = 7$ distinct cisternae of uniform width, $w$.\n3.  The retrograde transport of Golgi-resident enzymes is mediated by Coat Protein Complex I (COPI) vesicles. Biophysical measurements on these vesicles show that the combined time for budding from a donor cisterna and fusion with an acceptor cisterna is $t_{process} = 18$ seconds.\n4.  These COPI vesicles travel at a constant speed of $v_{retro} = 50$ nm/s between adjacent cisternae.\n\nAssuming the pure cisternal maturation model is correct, a Golgi-resident enzyme must be transported backward from a cisterna that has just matured to the next stage (e.g., from a position corresponding to cisterna $n+1$) to the cisterna that has just acquired the identity of its original home (cisterna $n$). This recycling process must be completed within the time it takes for one cisterna to mature into the next.\n\nCalculate the \"time deficit\" for one full retrograde recycling event. The time deficit is defined as the total time required for the retrograde cycle (from the start of budding to the completion of fusion) minus the time available for this cycle as dictated by the rate of cisternal maturation.\n\nExpress your answer in seconds, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "Under the cisternal maturation model, the time available for a cisterna to mature from one stage to the next is the time required for a cisterna to advance by one cisternal width. If the total stack length is $L$ and there are $N_{cis}$ cisternae of uniform width, then the width is $w = \\frac{L}{N_{cis}}$. The maturation proceeds at a rate such that a luminal cargo traverses the entire stack in time $T_{transit}$, so the time available for one maturation step is\n$$\nt_{\\text{available}}=\\frac{T_{transit}}{N_{cis}}.\n$$\nFor one full retrograde recycling event between adjacent cisternae, a COPI vesicle must undergo budding and fusion (combined time $t_{process}$) and travel between adjacent cisternae.

By correcting for experimental variables and analyzing the fate of a photo-labeled cargo cohort, you can calculate the relative contribution of each transport mechanism, gaining insight into how scientists quantify complex cellular dynamics.", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the two competing models for anterograde (forward) protein transport through the Golgi apparatus: the vesicular transport model and the cisternal maturation model. To quantify the contribution of each pathway, a live-cell fluorescence microscopy experiment is designed.\n\nThe experiment uses a genetically engineered cell line with two modifications:\n1.  A standard secretory cargo protein is fused to mEos, a photoconvertible fluorescent molecule. This cargo protein is initially green but turns irreversibly red upon exposure to 405 nm light.\n2.  A cis-Golgi-specific resident enzyme is fused to a stable blue fluorescent protein, serving as a stationary marker for the cis-Golgi compartment.\n\nAt the beginning of the experiment ($t=0$), a targeted laser pulse converts the cargo-mEos molecules from green to red, but only for the cargo population currently residing within the blue-marked cis-Golgi cisternae. The subsequent movement of this red-labeled cohort of cargo is then tracked over a characteristic time period, $T$. This time period is defined as the average time required for a cis-cisterna to mature into a medial-cisterna and is short enough that no significant amount of red-labeled cargo has exited the trans-Golgi.\n\nAfter time $T$, quantitative image analysis is used to determine the fate of the red-labeled cargo. The total fluorescence intensity from red cargo found in small, distinct vesicles that have budded off the original cisterna is measured to be $I_V = 2.1 \\times 10^4$ arbitrary fluorescence units (AFU). The total fluorescence intensity from red cargo that has remained with the original cisternal structure (which has now matured and moved to the medial-Golgi position) is measured to be $I_M = 5.9 \\times 10^4$ AFU.\n\nAn independent control experiment, conducted under identical imaging conditions, reveals a general, non-specific signal loss of 12% over the time period $T$ due to photobleaching of the red fluorophore.\n\nAssuming that anterograde transport from the cis- to the medial-Golgi occurs exclusively via these two pathways (represented by the cargo populations measured as $I_V$ and $I_M$), calculate the contribution of the cisternal maturation pathway to the total anterograde cargo flux.
