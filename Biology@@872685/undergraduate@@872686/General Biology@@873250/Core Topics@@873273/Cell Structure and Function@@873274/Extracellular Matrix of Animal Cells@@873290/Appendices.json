This foundational exercise asks you to predict the consequences of breaking this specific link. By considering a cell engineered to lack the crucial binding site for the RGD sequence on its integrin receptors, you will practice thinking about cellular behavior from a molecular perspective and reinforce your understanding of receptor-ligand specificity [@problem_id:2294942].", "problem": "In cell biology, the adhesion of animal cells to the Extracellular Matrix (ECM) is a fundamental process mediated by specific molecular interactions. A major component of the ECM is the protein fibronectin, which contains a specific tripeptide sequence: Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD). On the cell surface, transmembrane proteins called integrins act as receptors. In a typical scenario, the integrin receptors on a cell recognize and bind specifically to the RGD sequence within fibronectin, anchoring the cell to the substrate.\n\nConsider a laboratory experiment where a line of animal cells is genetically engineered. In these modified cells, the integrin proteins expressed on the cell surface have been altered such that they completely lack the domain responsible for binding to the RGD sequence. These engineered cells are then introduced into a petri dish whose surface has been pre-coated with fibronectin.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes is the most likely observation after these engineered cells are incubated in the fibronectin-coated dish under conditions that would normally support cell adhesion and growth?\n\nA. The cells will adhere to the fibronectin and spread out, behaving identically to normal, non-engineered cells.\n\nB. The cells will adhere much more strongly to the fibronectin than normal cells because the lack of a specific domain triggers a compensatory, high-affinity binding state.\n\nC. The cells will fail to form stable attachments to the fibronectin and will likely remain rounded and floating in the culture medium.\n\nD. The cells will adhere to the fibronectin but will be unable to initiate cell spreading, remaining in a rounded but firmly attached state.\n\nE. The cells will immediately undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) as a direct result of contact with the fibronectin surface.", "solution": "The core principle is ligand-receptor specificity: fibronectin contains the RGD motif that is recognized by specific integrins (for example, $\\alpha_{5}\\beta_{1}$ and $\\alpha_{v}\\beta_{3}$) on the cell surface. Stable cell adhesion to a fibronectin-coated substrate requires integrin engagement of the RGD site, leading to initial attachment, integrin clustering, and formation of focal adhesions that support spreading and growth. If integrins are genetically altered to lack the domain responsible for RGD binding, then the specific interaction between integrins and the RGD sequence in fibronectin cannot occur.\n\nFrom this, the immediate consequence is that the engineered cells cannot form specific integrin-fibronectin bonds. Without these bonds, cells cannot establish the initial adhesion necessary to resist shear and gravity in culture medium, cannot initiate outside-in signaling or focal adhesion assembly, and therefore will not spread. The morphological expectation is that cells remain rounded and, lacking stable adhesion, will likely float.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because normal adhesion and spreading require integrin-RGD binding, which is absent.\n- Option B is incorrect because removing the binding domain eliminates affinity rather than inducing a compensatory high-affinity state.\n- Option C is correct because loss of the RGD-binding domain prevents stable attachment to fibronectin, leaving cells rounded and non-adherent.\n- Option D is incorrect because a rounded-but-firmly-attached state would still require integrin binding; here, the binding domain is missing, so even firm attachment cannot occur.\n- Option E is incorrect because immediate apoptosis upon contact is not expected; while prolonged loss of adhesion can trigger anoikis, it is not an immediate consequence of contacting fibronectin.\n\nTherefore, the most likely observation is failure to adhere with cells remaining rounded and floating.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2294942"}, {"introduction": "While stable adhesion is necessary for anchoring cells, dynamic processes like cell migration require something more: the ability to both attach and detach. This practice moves beyond static adhesion to explore the mechanics of cellular movement through an engineered environment. By analyzing a series of controlled experiments involving invasive and non-invasive cells on custom-designed hydrogels, you will deduce the critical role that matrix-degrading enzymes like MMPs play in enabling the cycle of adhesion and de-adhesion required for migration [@problem_id:2294945].", "problem": "A bioengineering team is investigating the mechanisms of cancer cell invasion. They design a set of synthetic hydrogels to mimic the extracellular matrix. The hydrogel is composed of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), which is biologically inert and does not support cell adhesion on its own. They create three different formulations:\n\n*   **Gel-A:** The PEG hydrogel is functionalized with the cell-adhesion protein fibronectin, which is attached via a short peptide linker. This specific linker is designed to be cleaved exclusively by Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), an enzyme often secreted by invasive cancer cells.\n*   **Gel-B:** The PEG hydrogel is functionalized with fibronectin that is attached via a non-cleavable linker, making the adhesion points permanent.\n*   **Gel-C:** The PEG hydrogel is functionalized with the MMP-9 cleavable peptide linker, but no fibronectin is attached.\n\nTwo human cell lines are cultured on these gels:\n1.  **INV-9 Cells:** An invasive metastatic cancer cell line known to constitutively secrete high levels of active MMP-9.\n2.  **N-INV Cells:** A non-invasive, non-metastatic cell line that does not secrete MMP-9.\n\nAfter 48 hours of incubation, the migratory behavior of the cells is observed using time-lapse microscopy. The key observations are as follows:\n\n1.  On Gel-A, INV-9 cells adhere, spread, and exhibit robust, directional migration across the surface.\n2.  On Gel-B, INV-9 cells adhere and spread, but show very limited migration, appearing \"stuck\" in place.\n3.  On Gel-C, neither INV-9 nor N-INV cells adhere to the surface.\n4.  On both Gel-A and Gel-B, N-INV cells adhere and spread, but show very limited migration, similar to the behavior of INV-9 cells on Gel-B.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and mechanistically sound conclusion about the role of MMP-9 in the migration of INV-9 cells in this system?\n\nA. The presence of fibronectin is the sole requirement for cell migration, and MMP-9 secretion is a coincidental and unrelated cellular process.\n\nB. The proteolytic activity of MMP-9 is essential for migration because it generates fibronectin fragments that act as potent chemoattractants, guiding the cells forward.\n\nC. The INV-9 cells require a dynamic process of adhesion and de-adhesion for migration; MMP-9-mediated cleavage of the fibronectin linker enables the necessary release of trailing-edge adhesions.\n\nD. High levels of MMP-9 secretion are toxic to the cells, and the migration observed on Gel-A is an escape response away from locally high enzyme concentrations.\n\nE. The primary function of MMP-9 is to activate intracellular signaling pathways that promote motility, and its enzymatic activity on the matrix is secondary.", "solution": "1) Define the engineered variables and their mechanistic intent. The PEG hydrogel is inert without ligands. Fibronectin supplies adhesion sites. The MMP-9-cleavable linker is engineered so that only MMP-9 can sever the connection between fibronectin and the gel, thereby allowing spatially controlled loss of adhesion where MMP-9 is active. A non-cleavable linker prevents such release.\n\n2) Extract functional roles from controls. Observation (3) shows that on Gel-C (cleavable linker only, no fibronectin) neither cell type adheres, establishing that fibronectin is required for adhesion in this system. Therefore, any differences in migration across other conditions must arise from differences in the dynamics of adhesion turnover rather than from nonspecific gel interactions.\n\n3) Establish the requirement for adhesion de-adhesion dynamics for migration. Cell migration on adhesive substrates typically requires a cycle: (i) leading-edge protrusion with new adhesions, (ii) traction generation, and (iii) trailing-edge de-adhesion. If adhesions cannot be released, cells spread but become immobilized. Observation (2) shows INV-9 cells on Gel-B (fibronectin with non-cleavable linker) adhere and spread but exhibit minimal migration, consistent with failure of trailing-edge release because adhesion points are permanent. This links impaired migration to the inability to cleave matrix attachments.\n\n4) Link MMP-9 proteolysis to effective adhesion turnover. Observation (1) shows INV-9 cells on Gel-A (fibronectin with MMP-9 cleavable linker) adhere, spread, and migrate robustly. Because INV-9 secrete active MMP-9, they can locally cleave the linker, releasing adhesions—particularly at the trailing edge—thus completing the adhesion turnover cycle required for productive, directional migration. The critical difference from Gel-B is the presence of a proteolytically releasable linkage that INV-9 can cleave.\n\n5) Demonstrate necessity of MMP-9 for migration on Gel-A. Observation (4) shows that N-INV cells, which do not secrete MMP-9, adhere and spread on both Gel-A and Gel-B but do not migrate effectively. On Gel-A, the linker is cleavable only if MMP-9 is present; without MMP-9, the functional outcome mirrors Gel-B: adhesions are effectively permanent, yielding low migration. Thus, the ability to cleave the linker via MMP-9 is necessary for migration in this system, independent of general cell health or generic motility signaling.\n\n6) Exclude alternative mechanisms. \n- Option A is inconsistent because fibronectin alone is insufficient for migration: INV-9 on Gel-B and N-INV on Gel-A both have fibronectin yet fail to migrate, showing that adhesion without controlled de-adhesion immobilizes cells.\n- Option B posits chemoattractant fragments of fibronectin as the key driver. However, the engineered cleavage target is the linker, not fibronectin itself; robust migration requires the ability to sever the linkage to release adhesions. Moreover, if soluble fragments were dominant cues, INV-9 on Gel-B should still respond, but they remain stuck because the adhesions cannot be released.\n- Option D (toxicity/escape) is contradicted by the dependence on linker cleavability and the lack of migration by N-INV on Gel-A; migration is tied to controlled matrix cleavage rather than avoidance of enzyme-rich zones.\n- Option E assigns a primary role to intracellular signaling by MMP-9; however, MMP-9 is an extracellular protease, and the decisive variable here is the cleavability of the extracellular linker, directly implicating its enzymatic action on the matrix as primary for motility.\n\n7) Mechanistic conclusion. The data support that INV-9 cells require dynamic adhesion turnover for migration, with MMP-9-mediated cleavage of the fibronectin-gel linker enabling release of trailing-edge adhesions necessary for forward translocation.
