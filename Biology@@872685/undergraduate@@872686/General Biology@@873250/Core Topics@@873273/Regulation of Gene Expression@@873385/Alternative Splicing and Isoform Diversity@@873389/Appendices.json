{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Alternative splicing is a powerful mechanism for expanding a cell's proteome from a limited set of genes. One of the most common forms of alternative splicing involves 'cassette exons,' which can be either included in the mature transcript or skipped entirely. This simple binary choice, when applied to multiple exons within a single gene, creates a vast potential for isoform diversity. This first exercise invites you to explore the combinatorial power of this mechanism by calculating the maximum number of unique transcripts that can arise from a hypothetical gene with several independent cassette exons [@problem_id:2277578].", "problem": "A team of molecular biologists is studying a newly discovered gene, `Neuroflex-1`, in a species of tardigrade. This gene is hypothesized to be involved in the organism's remarkable stress-resistance. The pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) transcribed from the `Neuroflex-1` gene contains a total of 12 exons. Through advanced RNA sequencing, the researchers have determined that 5 of these exons are subject to alternative splicing. These 5 exons are specifically identified as 'cassette exons'. A cassette exon is an exon that can either be included in the final mature messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript or be entirely skipped (spliced out). The decision to include or skip any one of these 5 cassette exons is independent of the decision for any of the other four. The remaining 7 exons are constitutive, meaning they are always present in the final mRNA.\n\nAssuming that every combination of including or skipping these 5 cassette exons results in a unique and stable mRNA molecule, what is the maximum number of distinct mature mRNA isoforms that can be produced from the `Neuroflex-1` gene?", "solution": "We have 5 cassette exons, each of which can be in one of two states in the mature mRNA: included or skipped. By the rule of product (multiplication principle) for independent choices, the total number of distinct combinations arising from these 5 independent binary choices is\n$$\n\\prod_{i=1}^{5} 2 = 2^{5}.\n$$\nEquivalently, one can count by the number of ways to include exactly $k$ of the 5 cassette exons and sum over all $k$ using binomial coefficients:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{k} = 2^{5}.\n$$\nThe 7 constitutive exons are always present and therefore do not affect the count of distinct isoforms; they contribute no additional combinatorial variability. Thus, assuming each distinct combination yields a unique and stable mRNA, the maximum number of distinct mature mRNA isoforms is\n$$\n2^{5} = 32.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{32}$$", "id": "2277578"}, {"introduction": "The functional consequence of an alternative splicing event depends critically on how it affects the protein's reading frame. Because the genetic code is read in non-overlapping triplets of nucleotides, insertions or deletions that are not a multiple of three cause a frameshift, scrambling the downstream amino acid sequence. This practice problem [@problem_id:2277577] challenges you to compare two distinct splicing events—exon skipping and the use of an alternative splice site—and predict their differential impacts on the final protein, reinforcing the central importance of maintaining the integrity of the reading frame.", "problem": "A hypothetical eukaryotic gene, Gene F, is transcribed into a precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) that contains three exons and two introns in the following order: Exon 1 - Intron 1 - Exon 2 - Intron 2 - Exon 3. The protein's translation initiation codon (start codon) is located in Exon 1, and the normal termination codon (stop codon) is in Exon 3. Biochemical analysis reveals that Exon 2 is exactly 123 nucleotides in length.\n\nThis pre-mRNA undergoes alternative splicing in two different ways to produce two distinct mature messenger RNA (mRNA) isoforms, Isoform A and Isoform B.\n\n- **Isoform A:** This isoform is generated by exon skipping, where Exon 2 is completely removed, and Exon 1 is spliced directly to Exon 3.\n- **Isoform B:** This isoform is generated through the use of an alternative 3' splice site. A cryptic splice site within Intron 2, located 50 nucleotides upstream of the normal splice site for Exon 3, is used. This results in an mRNA where Exon 1 is spliced to Exon 2, which is then spliced to a 50-nucleotide segment of Intron 2, followed by Exon 3.\n\nAssuming that both mature mRNA isoforms are stable and successfully translated, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the consequences for the amino acid sequences of the resulting proteins, particularly concerning the portion of the protein encoded by Exon 3?\n\nA. Both isoforms will result in a frameshift mutation, leading to a completely altered amino acid sequence encoded by Exon 3 in both resulting proteins.\n\nB. In Isoform A, the amino acid sequence encoded by Exon 3 will be unchanged, while in Isoform B, the sequence encoded by Exon 3 will be completely altered due to a frameshift.\n\nC. In Isoform B, the amino acid sequence encoded by Exon 3 will be unchanged, while in Isoform A, the sequence will be completely altered due to a frameshift.\n\nD. Both splicing events will preserve the reading frame. Isoform A will produce a protein missing a block of amino acids, and Isoform B will produce a protein with an extra block of amino acids, but the sequence from Exon 3 will be correct in both.\n\nE. Both isoforms will be non-functional. Isoform A will have a large internal deletion, and Isoform B will have a small insertion, both of which are equally catastrophic to protein structure.", "solution": "We use the coding principle that translation reads nucleotides in non-overlapping triplet codons. Therefore:\n- A deletion or insertion that changes the coding sequence by a length congruent to $0 \\pmod{3}$ preserves the reading frame.\n- A length change not divisible by $3$ causes a frameshift, altering all downstream codons until a new stop codon is encountered.\n\nGiven that translation initiates in Exon 1 and the normal stop codon is in Exon 3, the effect of splicing on the portion encoded by Exon 3 depends on whether the reading frame at the Exon 3 boundary is preserved.\n\nIsoform A (exon skipping of Exon 2):\n- Exon 2 length is $L=123$ nucleotides. Compute $L \\pmod{3}$:\n$$\n123 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}.\n$$\n- This corresponds to removing exactly $L/3=41$ codons. Because the net change is a multiple of $3$, the reading frame is preserved across the Exon 1–Exon 3 junction. Therefore, the amino acid sequence encoded by Exon 3 is translated in the original frame and remains unchanged (although the protein lacks the 41 amino acids encoded by Exon 2).\n\nIsoform B (alternative $3^{\\prime}$ splice site adding 50 nucleotides of Intron 2 before Exon 3):\n- The retained intronic segment has length $s=50$ nucleotides. Compute $s \\pmod{3}$:\n$$\n50 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}.\n$$\n- This insertion is not divisible by $3$, which shifts the reading frame at the junction preceding Exon 3. Consequently, the codon register for Exon 3 is altered; the amino acid sequence encoded by Exon 3 will be changed (and a premature stop codon is likely, though not required to answer the question).\n\nConclusion:\n- Isoform A preserves the reading frame and leaves the Exon 3-encoded sequence unchanged.\n- Isoform B introduces a frameshift that alters the Exon 3-encoded sequence.\n\nThe statement that matches these outcomes is: In Isoform A, Exon 3’s amino acid sequence is unchanged; in Isoform B, Exon 3’s sequence is completely altered due to a frameshift.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2277577"}, {"introduction": "Mutations affecting splicing can have profound consequences for health, and understanding their quantitative impact is a key skill in molecular medicine.

The wild-type allele is transcribed and all its pre-mRNA transcripts are spliced correctly.\n2.  The mutant allele is transcribed at the same rate as the wild-type allele.\n3.
