This initial step is often performed computationally, using bioinformatic tools to scan entire genomes for potential targets. This practice will guide you through the most fundamental principle of microRNA (miRNA) target prediction, which relies on a small but critical region of the miRNA known as the \"seed sequence.\"", "problem": "A research team is studying gene regulation in the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*. They have just discovered a novel microRNA (miRNA), which is a small non-coding RNA molecule that regulates gene expression. They have determined its mature sequence to be 5'-UGAGGUAGUAGGUUGUAUAGUU-3'. In animals, miRNAs primarily function by binding to the 3' Untranslated Region (3' UTR) of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), leading to their translational repression or degradation. The binding specificity is largely determined by a critical \"seed sequence,\" which comprises nucleotides 2 through 8 at the 5' end of the miRNA.\n\nThe team wants to perform an initial, genome-wide computational screen to generate a list of high-confidence candidate mRNA targets for this newly discovered miRNA. Which of the following bioinformatic strategies represents the most direct and fundamental first step for this task?\n\nA. Scan all annotated 3' UTR sequences in the *Drosophila* genome for sites that are a perfect reverse complement to the miRNA's seed sequence.\n\nB. Search the entire *Drosophila* genome for perfect reverse complements to the full 22-nucleotide miRNA sequence.\n\nC. Analyze the 5' UTRs of all known mRNAs for regions with a high percentage of Guanine-Cytosine (GC) pairs, which would promote stable binding.\n\nD. Align the full miRNA sequence against all known protein sequences to find functional homologies.\n\nE. Identify all mRNA transcripts containing a 3' UTR sequence that is identical to the miRNA's seed sequence.", "solution": "We identify the biological principle governing animal miRNA target recognition: in animals, miRNAs primarily repress targets by binding sites in 3' UTRs via Watson-Crick base pairing that is dominated by the seed region, defined as nucleotides 2 through 8 from the miRNA 5' end. The most fundamental and direct computational first step for a genome-wide screen is therefore to search for perfect reverse-complement matches to this seed in annotated 3' UTRs, because such seed matches capture the dominant specificity determinant and are the canonical basis for most target prediction pipelines.\n\nEvaluate each option against this principle:\n- A specifies scanning all annotated 3' UTR sequences for sites that are a perfect reverse complement to the miRNA seed. This directly encodes the seed rule and restricts the search to the biologically relevant region (3' UTR), making it the correct first step.\n- B proposes searching the entire genome for perfect reverse complements to the full 22-nt miRNA. In animals, most targets do not exhibit full-length complementarity; requiring full complementarity is too stringent and scanning the entire genome ignores the 3' UTR focus, so this would miss most bona fide targets and include irrelevant regions.\n- C focuses on 5' UTR GC content, which is not the primary determinant of miRNA targeting, and 5' UTRs are not the canonical target regions in animals.\n- D aligns the miRNA to protein sequences, which is biologically inappropriate because miRNAs bind RNA, not proteins.\n- E looks for 3' UTR sequences identical to the seed rather than reverse-complementary; miRNA binding requires antiparallel Watson-Crick complementarity, so identity would not mediate binding and this criterion is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and fundamental first step is to scan 3' UTRs for perfect reverse complements to the seed sequence, as in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2304755"}, {"introduction": "The regulatory landscape of ncRNAs is not a simple one-to-one interaction; it is a complex, interconnected network.

The rate of protein synthesis, $P$, from the target mRNA is inversely proportional to the free miRNA concentration, $[miRNA]_{free}$.

A synthetic transcriptional activator protein, `SynAct`, is expressed from a gene under the control of a strong, constitutive promoter. The messenger RNA (mRNA) for `SynAct` has been engineered to contain, in its 3' Untranslated Region (3' UTR), one perfect binding site for `miR-A` and one perfect binding site for `miR-B`.\n2.
