This final practice [@problem_id:2289158] moves from cellular biochemistry to whole-plant physiology by considering a mutant plant unable to perform a major type of cyclic electron flow. This scenario will test your ability to predict how a specific molecular defect can impact a plant's ability to perform photosynthesis efficiently and protect itself from damage, especially under stressful and fluctuating environmental conditions.", "problem": "In the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, photosynthetic electron transport occurs via two major pathways: linear electron flow (LEF) and cyclic electron flow (CEF). LEF involves both Photosystem II (PSII) and Photosystem I (PSI), producing both ATP and NADPH. In contrast, a major pathway of CEF involves only PSI and ferredoxin, and its primary function is to produce ATP without the net synthesis of NADPH, a process dependent on the PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION 5 (PGR5) protein. The Calvin-Benson cycle, which fixes $\\text{CO}_2$, requires an ATP to NADPH consumption ratio of approximately 3:2.\n\nConsider a mutant plant that completely lacks a functional PGR5 protein. This mutant is grown alongside a wild-type plant under controlled conditions, and both are subjected to fluctuating light, alternating between periods of low light and sudden, sustained bursts of high light intensity.\n\nBased on the known roles of LEF and CEF, which of the following phenotypes is most likely to be observed in the PGR5-deficient mutant compared to the wild-type plant, particularly during and after the transition from low to high light?\n\nA. The mutant will exhibit a higher rate of $\\text{CO}_2$ fixation than the wild-type, as all electron flow is channeled through LEF, maximizing NADPH production for the Calvin cycle.\n\nB. The mutant will show a reduced rate of $\\text{CO}_2$ fixation and will be more susceptible to photodamage, especially at PSI, due to an imbalanced ATP/NADPH ratio and impaired induction of photoprotective mechanisms.\n\nC. The mutant will accumulate ATP to toxic levels while becoming deficient in NADPH, leading to a complete and immediate cessation of all photosynthetic activity upon exposure to high light.\n\nD. The mutant will be indistinguishable from the wild-type because the loss of PGR5-dependent CEF is fully compensated by an upregulation of an alternative, NDH-dependent CEF pathway, maintaining normal photosynthetic function.\n\nE. The mutant will exhibit enhanced growth and fitness, as the inability to perform CEF prevents the wasteful dissipation of light energy, leading to higher quantum yields of photosynthesis under all light conditions.", "solution": "We analyze the roles of linear electron flow (LEF) and cyclic electron flow (CEF) and the consequences of a PGR5 deficiency during transitions from low to high light.\n\nFirst, LEF involves PSII and PSI, generating both ATP and NADPH with a stoichiometry that provides fewer ATP per NADPH than the Calvin-Benson cycle requires. The Calvin-Benson cycle consumes ATP and NADPH at an approximate ratio of 3:2, so an ATP supplement is typically needed beyond what LEF alone supplies. CEF around PSI, in the major PGR5-dependent pathway, returns electrons from ferredoxin to the plastoquinone pool and cytochrome $b_6f$ complex, thereby pumping additional protons into the lumen without net NADPH formation. This increases the proton motive force to synthesize additional ATP and rapidly acidifies the lumen.\n\nSecond, lumen acidification via CEF serves two photoprotective roles on transitions to high light: (i) it induces energy-dependent nonphotochemical quenching (qE), dissipating excess excitation energy as heat, and (ii) it enforces photosynthetic control at the cytochrome $b_6f$ complex, throttling electron flow to PSI to prevent acceptor-side over-reduction of PSI. Together, these mechanisms protect PSI from photodamage under sudden high light when carbon assimilation is not yet fully activated.\n\nThird, in a PGR5-deficient mutant, the PGR5-dependent CEF pathway is impaired. Upon a shift from low to high light:\n- ATP supply from CEF does not increase, so the ATP/NADPH supply is further imbalanced relative to Calvin-cycle demand. The ATP deficit slows the Calvin cycle, reducing the rate of $\\text{CO}_2$ fixation.\n- The lack of rapid lumen acidification compromises qE and photosynthetic control at cytochrome $b_6f$ complex. As a result, electron flow to PSI is not throttled, PSI acceptors become over-reduced, and PSI is vulnerable to photodamage through reactive oxygen species formation and sustained acceptor-side limitation.\n- These effects are particularly prominent during and after high-light transitions when metabolic sinks are not yet fully engaged and when strong regulation by ΔpH is required.\n\nFourth, we evaluate the given options:\n- A is incorrect because channeling all electrons through LEF does not maximize Calvin-cycle rates; without CEF, ATP becomes limiting, leading to reduced $\\text{CO}_2$ fixation and increased acceptor-side pressure on PSI.\n- B is correct because the mutant exhibits reduced $\\text{CO}_2$ fixation due to ATP limitation and enhanced susceptibility to photodamage, especially at PSI, due to impaired ΔpH-dependent photoprotection and control of electron flow.\n- C is incorrect because the mutant does not accumulate ATP to toxic levels; rather, it is ATP-limited and often has an over-reduced stroma due to limited NADP+ regeneration.\n- D is incorrect because NDH-dependent CEF generally cannot fully compensate for the rapid and substantial regulatory roles of PGR5-dependent CEF under fluctuating light; PGR5 mutants are known to be highly susceptible to PSI photoinhibition under such conditions.\n- E is incorrect because suppressing CEF is not beneficial; it removes critical photoprotection and regulatory capacity, decreasing overall fitness and quantum yield under fluctuating light.\n\nThus, the phenotype most consistent with known roles of PGR5-dependent CEF is reduced $\\text{CO}_2$ fixation and increased susceptibility to PSI photodamage during and after the low-to-high light transition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2289158"}]}
