The analysis is focused on the ATP cost per net carbon assimilated.\n\nThe basic energetic requirement for the Calvin cycle, common to both plants, is 3 molecules of ATP per molecule of CO2 assimilated.\n\nIn the C4 plant, an additional carbon-concentrating mechanism is active. This mechanism consumes 2 molecules of ATP for every molecule of CO2 it shuttles to the bundle sheath cells. In doing so, it completely suppresses the oxygenase activity of the enzyme RuBisCO.\n\nIn the C3 plant, under these specific environmental conditions, the enzyme RuBisCO exhibits both carboxylase and oxygenase activity. For every two carboxylation events that successfully fix a molecule of CO2, there is one oxygenation event. Each oxygenation event initiates the photorespiratory pathway, which ultimately results in the net release of 0.5 molecules of CO2 and consumes 3.5 molecules of ATP in the process of salvaging the remaining carbon compounds.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the total ATP consumed per *net* molecule of CO2 assimilated in the C3 plant to that in the C4 plant under these conditions.
