One of the primary mechanisms generating this diversity in sexually reproducing organisms is the process of meiosis.\n\nConsider a hypothetical species of insect, the Azure-winged Beetle, which has a diploid chromosome number of $2n=28$. During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes align at the metaphase plate and then separate, a process known as independent assortment. This means that for each pair of homologous chromosomes, the orientation (i.e., which pole the paternal vs. maternal chromosome will travel to) is random and independent of the orientation of all other pairs.\n\nAssuming two Azure-winged Beetles mate, calculate the total number of possible genetically distinct zygotes that could be produced. For the purpose of this problem, you must consider only the genetic variation that arises from the independent assortment of whole chromosomes and ignore any variation that would be introduced by crossing over.", "solution": "We are told the Azure-winged Beetle has diploid chromosome number $2n=28$, so the haploid number is $n=14$. In meiosis I, independent assortment means that for each homologous chromosome pair, there are $2$ equally likely orientations (maternal vs. paternal homologue going to a given pole), and these choices are independent across all pairs.\n\nFor one parent, the number of genetically distinct gametes produced by independent assortment alone (ignoring crossing over) is the product of $2$ choices for each of the $n$ homologous pairs:\n$$\n\\text{gametes per parent} = 2^{n} = 2^{14}.\n$$\nWhen two parents mate, the zygote is formed by fusion of one gamete from each parent. The total number of genetically distinct zygotes (again ignoring crossing over) is the product of the numbers of possible gametes from each parent:\n$$\n\\text{zygotes} = 2^{14} \\times 2^{14} = 2^{28}.\n$$\nEquivalently, per chromosome pair in the zygote there are $2$ maternal choices times $2$ paternal choices, giving $4$ possibilities per pair, and across $n$ pairs this yields $4^{n} = 2^{2n} = 2^{28}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2^{28}}$$", "id": "2314743"}, {"introduction": "While independent assortment shuffles entire chromosomes, crossing over shuffles the alleles on a single chromosome, creating new combinations.
