This exercise challenges you to compare a cell that has completed the first meiotic division with a standard somatic cell.

After completion of Meiosis I, the resulting secondary oocyte has $n$ chromosomes, each still consisting of two sister chromatids (no S phase occurs between Meiosis I and Meiosis II), so its DNA content is $2C$.\n\nThus, the arrested oocyte (post-Meiosis I, pre-Meiosis II) has:\n- Chromosome number $n = 19$, which is half of the somatic G1 chromosome number $2n = 38$.\n- DNA content $2C$, which is the same as the somatic G1 DNA content $2C$.\n\nTherefore, it has half the number of chromosomes but the same amount of DNA, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2322602"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply reducing chromosome counts, meiosis is a powerful engine for generating genetic diversity through recombination. This fundamental process involves the physical exchange of DNA between homologous chromosomes during Prophase I. This practice problem simplifies this complex event to a single crossover, allowing you to clearly see how new combinations of alleles are formed on chromatids and how this translates into a specific proportion of recombinant gametes [@problem_id:2322637].", "problem": "Consider a diploid organism in which two genes, designated `Gene 1` and `Gene 2`, are located on the same chromosome. In a particular individual, one homologous chromosome carries the alleles `G1` and `G2`, while the other homologous chromosome carries the alleles `g1` and `g2`. A single one of this individual's primary meiocytes, which are the cells that undergo meiosis, enters the meiotic process. During Prophase I, precisely one crossover event occurs between the genetic loci of Gene 1 and Gene 2.

After DNA replication, each homolog consists of two sister chromatids. During Prophase I, a single crossover occurs between the loci of Gene 1 and Gene 2. By the principle of meiotic crossing over, a single crossover involves two non-sister chromatids and exchanges the chromosomal segments between the loci, producing exactly two recombinant chromatids and leaving the other two chromatids parental.\n\nLabel the two sister chromatids from the $G1\\text{-}G2$ homolog as chromatids $1$ and $2$, and those from the $g1\\text{-}g2$ homolog as chromatids $3$ and $4$. A single crossover between the loci in any pair of non-sister chromatids (e.g., $1$ with $3$) results in two recombinant chromatids carrying $G1\\text{-}g2$ and $g1\\text{-}G2$, while the two non-participating chromatids remain parental ($G1\\text{-}G2$ and $g1\\text{-}g2$).\n\nMeiosis I separates homologous chromosomes, and Meiosis II separates sister chromatids, so each of the four chromatids becomes a gamete.
