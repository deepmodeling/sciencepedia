This final practice moves beyond typical diploid organisms to the fascinating world of haplodiploid insects, like the male bee, which is haploid. You must reason from first principles: what are the absolute, non-negotiable requirements for mitosis and meiosis? This scenario will solidify your understanding of why mitosis is a universal process for growth, whereas meiosis is fundamentally linked to the pairing of homologous chromosomes found in diploidy [@problem_id:2310406].", "problem": "In many species of Hymenoptera, including honey bees (*Apis mellifera*), sex is determined by a system called haplodiploidy. In this system, females (queens and workers) develop from fertilized eggs and are therefore diploid (2n), possessing two sets of chromosomes. In contrast, males (drones) develop from unfertilized eggs via parthenogenesis and are haploid (n), possessing only a single set of chromosomes.\n\nConsider a male drone bee. This organism must grow from a single-celled zygote (though unfertilized) into a multicellular adult, and it must also produce gametes (sperm) to have the potential to reproduce with a queen. Based on your understanding of the fundamental mechanics of cell division, which of the following statements accurately describes the processes of cell division in this haploid male drone?\n\nA. The drone's somatic cells can undergo mitosis for growth and tissue repair. To produce gametes, its germline cells undergo a process that is functionally equivalent to mitosis, not meiosis.\n\nB. The drone can undergo mitosis for growth, but to produce gametes, it must undergo meiosis, which results in sperm cells with a chromosome number of n/2.\n\nC. The drone cannot undergo mitosis for growth because the process requires homologous chromosome pairs, which are absent in its haploid cells. It produces all its cells, including gametes, via meiosis.\n\nD. The drone undergoes a special form of meiosis for both somatic cell growth and gamete production, as this is the only division process that can function in a haploid organism.\n\nE. The drone is incapable of mitosis because it is haploid, and it is incapable of meiosis because it only needs to produce haploid gametes. Therefore, its growth occurs exclusively through cell enlargement, not cell division.", "solution": "Haplodiploidy in Hymenoptera yields males that are haploid, with a single set of chromosomes denoted by $n$. The fundamental mechanics of mitosis and meiosis determine which divisions are possible and what chromosome numbers result.\n\nFirst, consider mitosis. The defining steps are DNA replication to form sister chromatids, alignment at the metaphase plate, and separation of sister chromatids to opposite poles, followed by cytokinesis. This process does not require homologous chromosome pairing; it only requires the presence of sister chromatids after S phase. Therefore, haploid cells ($n$) can undergo mitosis, producing two genetically identical haploid daughter cells, which supports growth and tissue maintenance in the drone.\n\nNext, consider meiosis. Canonical meiosis requires:\n- Pairing (synapsis) of homologous chromosomes during prophase I,\n- Recombination between homologs,\n- Reductional division in meiosis I that separates homologous chromosomes, halving the chromosome number, and\n- Equational division in meiosis II that separates sister chromatids.\n\nIn a haploid organism, there are no homologous pairs to synapse, so standard meiosis I cannot proceed as designed. If a true reductional division were to occur, it would yield cells with chromosome number $\\frac{n}{2}$, which would not constitute a complete genome and is therefore not the mechanism of functional gametogenesis in haploid males. In Hymenoptera males, spermatogenesis proceeds via divisions that are functionally equivalent to mitosis (variously described as modified meiosis or mitotic divisions in the germline), producing haploid sperm without reducing chromosome number, and typically yielding genetically identical sperm due to the absence of recombination between homologs.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is correct: somatic cells undergo mitosis; germline divisions to form sperm are functionally equivalent to mitosis, not a reductional meiosis.\n- B is incorrect because meiosis would produce gametes with chromosome number $\\frac{n}{2}$, which is not how drone spermatogenesis operates.\n- C is incorrect because mitosis does not require homologous chromosome pairs; haploid cells can mitotically divide.\n- D is incorrect because meiosis is neither required nor suitable for somatic growth, and canonical meiosis is not the operative process in haploid males.\n- E is incorrect because haploid cells are fully capable of mitosis, and drones do not grow solely by cell enlargement.\n\nTherefore, the accurate description is given by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2310406"}]}
