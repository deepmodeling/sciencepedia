By considering a hypothetical scenario where this complex is specifically inactivated, you can deduce the primary consequences for spindle assembly and the cell's ability to even begin the process of chromosome segregation.", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the process of mitosis in a culture of synchronized animal cells. At the very end of the G2 phase, just before the cells are scheduled to enter prophase, a highly specific inhibitory molecule is introduced. This molecule's only known function is to bind to and completely inactivate all gamma-tubulin ring complexes ($\\gamma$-TuRCs). The $\\gamma$-TuRC is the protein complex located at the centrosome that is fundamentally required for the nucleation of new microtubules.\n\nAssuming all other cellular processes and checkpoint mechanisms, such as the spindle assembly checkpoint, are functioning correctly, which of the following statements describes the most direct and immediate fate of a cell attempting to undergo mitosis in the presence of this inhibitor?\n\nA. Chromosomes will fail to condense, and the cell will immediately enter a state of apoptosis.\n\nB. The cell will proceed through mitosis and cytokinesis, but the resulting daughter cells will have an incorrect number of chromosomes.\n\nC. The nuclear envelope will break down and chromosomes will condense, but the cell will arrest because a bipolar mitotic spindle cannot be assembled.\n\nD. The cell will be unable to replicate its centrosomes and will therefore arrest at the G2/M checkpoint before entering mitosis.\n\nE. The cell will form a complete and functional mitotic spindle, but the sister chromatids will fail to separate during anaphase.", "solution": "To determine the fate of the cell, we must analyze the specific role of the gamma-tubulin ring complex ($\\gamma$-TuRC) in the context of the mitotic cell cycle.\n\nStep 1: Understand the role of $\\gamma$-TuRC.\nThe problem states that $\\gamma$-TuRCs are essential for the nucleation of new microtubules and are located at the centrosome. In animal cells, the centrosome acts as the primary Microtubule Organizing Center (MTOC). During the transition from interphase to mitosis, the centrosomes mature and nucleate a dense array of microtubules called an aster. These asters form the poles of the mitotic spindle, which is the machinery responsible for segregating the duplicated chromosomes.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the effect of the inhibitor.\nThe inhibitor inactivates all $\\gamma$-TuRCs. This means that even though the cell has its centrosomes (which would have duplicated during the S phase), these centrosomes are now incapable of nucleating microtubules. Consequently, the formation of astral microtubules and the subsequent assembly of the mitotic spindle are completely blocked.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the progression of early mitotic events.\nThe cell is treated at the G2/M transition. At this point, it is already committed to entering mitosis, driven by high levels of Maturation-Promoting Factor (MPF, a cyclin-Cdk complex).\n- **Centrosome Duplication:** This occurs during S phase, long before the inhibitor is added. So, the cell has two centrosomes. The inhibitor does not affect the centrosomes themselves, only their function.\n- **Chromosome Condensation:** This process, occurring in prophase, is driven by an MPF-dependent phosphorylation cascade. It is independent of microtubule dynamics. Therefore, the chromosomes will condense as expected.\n- **Nuclear Envelope Breakdown:** This event in prometaphase is also triggered by MPF-mediated phosphorylation of nuclear lamins. It is independent of spindle formation. Therefore, the nuclear envelope will break down.\n\nBased on this, the cell will successfully enter prophase, condense its chromosomes, and likely proceed to a prometaphase-like state where the nuclear envelope is disassembled. However, it will be completely unable to form the mitotic spindle.\n\nStep 4: Consider the role of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC).\nThe SAC is a crucial surveillance mechanism that monitors the attachment of microtubules to the kinetochores of sister chromatids. The checkpoint ensures that anaphase does not begin until every chromosome is properly attached to the spindle and aligned at the metaphase plate. In our scenario, since no spindle can form, no microtubules will attach to any kinetochores. This lack of attachment will generate a strong \"wait\" signal, causing the SAC to be robustly activated. The activated SAC will inhibit the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), preventing the degradation of cyclin B and securin. This will cause the cell to arrest in a prometaphase-like state.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. Chromosome condensation is not affected, and apoptosis is a potential downstream effect of prolonged arrest, not the immediate consequence. So, this is incorrect.\n- B. The cell cannot proceed through mitosis without a spindle to segregate chromosomes. So, this is incorrect.\n- C. This option accurately describes the situation. Chromosome condensation and nuclear envelope breakdown occur, but the inability to form a spindle leads to a cell cycle arrest due to the SAC. This is the correct description of the direct outcome.\n- D. Centrosome replication occurs in S phase and is complete by G2. The inhibitor is added after this, so it does not affect centrosome number. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n- E. The cell cannot form a mitotic spindle in the first place, so it cannot reach anaphase. This statement is contradictory and incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most direct consequence is an arrest in a prophase/prometaphase state after chromosomes have condensed, because a mitotic spindle cannot be formed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2321398"}, {"introduction": "A functional mitotic spindle is not a static scaffold but a dynamic machine whose size and stability are determined by a precise balance of opposing forces. This practice problem [@problem_id:2321356] models the spindle as a system of competing motor proteins, some pushing the poles apart and others pulling them together. By simulating the loss of an inward-pulling motor, you will explore how this force balance dictates the final length of the spindle, revealing the principles that govern its steady-state architecture.", "problem": "The dynamic length of the mitotic spindle in a cell is maintained by a delicate balance of opposing molecular motors. We can model this system by considering the velocities they impart on the spindle poles.\n\n- A motor protein, Kinesin-5, works to push the spindle poles apart, contributing a separation velocity of $v_5$.\n- Another protein, Dynein, is anchored at the cell periphery and pulls on astral microtubules, also contributing to pole separation with a velocity of $v_d$.\n- A third motor, Kinesin-14, crosslinks microtubules and pulls the poles together, contributing a collapsing velocity of $v_{14}$.\n\nIn a normal, healthy cell (wild-type), the spindle assembles and reaches a stable, constant length $L_{WT}$ during metaphase. At this point, the total outward velocity is perfectly balanced by the inward velocity, such that $v_5 + v_d = v_{14}$. The cell itself has a finite diameter, $L_{cell}$, which imposes a physical upper limit on the spindle length. In a wild-type cell, it is observed that $L_{WT} < L_{cell}$.\n\nNow, consider a mutant cell line where the gene for Kinesin-14 is deleted, rendering it completely non-functional. Assume that the activities of Kinesin-5 and Dynein are unaffected by this mutation, and that $v_5$ and $v_d$ are constant positive values throughout spindle formation.\n\nStarting from a negligible initial pole-to-pole distance, which of the following outcomes best describes the fate of the spindle length in this mutant cell?\n\nA. The spindle will fail to elongate and will immediately collapse to a length of approximately zero.\n\nB. The spindle poles will separate, but the final spindle length will stabilize at a new length shorter than the wild-type length $L_{WT}$.\n\nC. The spindle will form and elongate until it reaches the normal wild-type length $L_{WT}$, at which point it will become stable.\n\nD. The spindle will continuously elongate, with its final length being limited only by the physical diameter of the cell, $L_{cell}$.\n\nE. The spindle will form but will be highly unstable, rapidly oscillating in length between near-zero and $L_{WT}$.", "solution": "Let $L(t)$ denote the pole-to-pole distance (spindle length) as a function of time. By the problem’s assumptions, Kinesin-5 and Dynein contribute constant outward velocities $v_5$ and $v_d$, respectively, and Kinesin-14 contributes an inward (collapsing) velocity $v_{14}$.\n\nThe instantaneous rate of change of spindle length is modeled by the superposition of these contributions:\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{dt} = v_5 + v_d - v_{14}.\n$$\nIn the wild-type metaphase steady state at length $L_{WT}$, the observed stability condition is\n$$\nv_5 + v_d = v_{14},\n$$\nwhich makes $\\frac{dL}{dt} = 0$ at $L_{WT}$ and yields a stable constant length with $L_{WT} < L_{cell}$.\n\nIn the mutant lacking Kinesin-14, the inward contribution is deleted, so\n$$\nv_{14} = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{dL}{dt} = v_5 + v_d.\n$$\nBy the problem statement, $v_5$ and $v_d$ are constant positive values, hence\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{dt} = v_5 + v_d > 0 \\quad \\text{for all } L \\text{ while unconstrained.}\n$$\nStarting from a negligible initial pole-to-pole distance $L(0) \\approx 0$, the solution increases monotonically:\n$$\nL(t) = (v_5 + v_d)\\, t \\quad \\text{until a boundary is encountered.}\n$$\nBecause the cell imposes a physical upper bound $L(t) \\leq L_{cell}$, the only limit on elongation in the absence of an inward motor is the geometric constraint of the cell. The time to reach this limit is\n$$\nt^{*} = \\frac{L_{cell}}{v_5 + v_d},\n$$\nafter which $L(t)$ cannot increase further due to the physical diameter constraint. There is no mechanism to stabilize at $L_{WT}$ or any shorter length because no inward velocity opposes the outward sum $v_5 + v_d$.\n\nTherefore, the spindle will elongate continuously until it reaches the physical limit set by $L_{cell}$.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2321356"}, {"introduction": "Ensuring that every chromosome is correctly attached to the spindle before segregation is paramount for preventing aneuploidy, and cells have evolved sophisticated error-correction mechanisms to do so. This exercise [@problem_id:2321384] delves into the tension-sensing pathway orchestrated by the Aurora B kinase, which destabilizes incorrect, low-tension attachments. By examining the outcome when this crucial quality control system is disabled, you can appreciate how the cell links mechanical forces to biochemical signals to guarantee the fidelity of cell division.", "problem": "In a cell biology experiment, a culture of actively dividing animal cells is treated with a novel proprietary drug called \"Correctin-inhibitor.\" This drug is known to have a single, highly specific molecular effect: it selectively inhibits the kinase activity of Aurora B kinase, but only at the kinetochore. The normal function of Aurora B kinase at this location is to sense the lack of mechanical tension from incorrect microtubule-kinetochore attachments and to destabilize these incorrect attachments, allowing for a new attempt at correct attachment. The drug does not affect any other cellular processes, including microtubule polymerization, spindle pole formation, or the activity of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C).\n\nGiven this information, which of the following outcomes is the most likely observation for cells treated with Correctin-inhibitor as they attempt to proceed through mitosis?\n\nA. The mitotic spindle will completely depolymerize, causing the cell to revert to an interphase-like state.\n\nB.

The chromosomes will attach to spindle microtubules, but many will remain persistently misaligned, failing to organize correctly at the metaphase plate.\n\nE. The cell will proceed through metaphase and enter anaphase prematurely, before all chromosomes have attached to the spindle.", "solution": "To determine the consequence of inhibiting the error-correcting function of Aurora B kinase at the kinetochore, we must first understand the normal process of chromosome alignment during mitosis.\n\n**Step 1: The Goal of Prometaphase and Metaphase**\nDuring prometaphase, microtubules emanating from the two spindle poles \"search and capture\" the kinetochores of chromosomes. The goal is to establish a state of bi-orientation, where the two sister kinetochores of a single chromosome are attached to microtubules from opposite spindle poles. This is called an amphitelic attachment. The opposing pulling forces generate tension across the centromere, which is a key signal for a correct attachment. Once all chromosomes have achieved this state, they become aligned at the spindle equator, a configuration known as the metaphase plate. This alignment is crucial for ensuring that sister chromatids are segregated equally to daughter cells during anaphase.\n\n**Step 2: The Role of Error Correction and Aurora B Kinase**\nThe attachment process is stochastic, and incorrect attachments frequently occur. Common errors include:\n- **Syntelic attachment:** Both sister kinetochores attach to microtubules from the same spindle pole.\n- **Merotelic attachment:** One kinetochore attaches to microtubules from both poles.\n\nThese incorrect attachments do not generate the proper tension that is characteristic of a correct amphitelic attachment. The cell has an error-correction mechanism to deal with this, which is orchestrated by Aurora B kinase. Aurora B is localized to the inner centromere. In the absence of tension (i.e., during an incorrect attachment), the outer kinetochore is brought into close proximity to Aurora B. Aurora B then phosphorylates proteins in the kinetochore, such as the Ndc80 complex, which reduces their affinity for microtubules. This destabilizes the incorrect attachment, releasing the microtubule(s) and giving the cell another opportunity to form a correct, stable, high-tension attachment.\n\n**Step 3: The Effect of the Drug \"Correctin-inhibitor\"**\nThe problem states that Correctin-inhibitor specifically inhibits the kinase activity of Aurora B at the kinetochore. This means the error-correction mechanism is disabled. When an incorrect attachment (e.g., syntelic or merotelic) forms, there is no tension, but the inhibited Aurora B kinase can no longer phosphorylate its targets to destabilize the attachment. Consequently, the incorrect, low-tension attachment is \"locked in\" and becomes inappropriately stabilized.\n\n**Step 4: Predicting the Cellular Outcome**\nWith the error-correction mechanism shut down, chromosomes that happen to form incorrect attachments will remain incorrectly attached. A chromosome with a syntelic attachment will be pulled toward only one pole. A chromosome with a merotelic attachment might be pulled toward one pole while also being tethered to the other, causing it to lag behind. Neither of these scenarios allows the chromosome to align at the metaphase plate. Therefore, the cell will end up in a state where some chromosomes (those that luckily formed correct attachments) may be at the metaphase plate, but many others will be persistantly misaligned, scattered between the poles and the plate. The cell is unable to achieve proper chromosome congression.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluating the Options**\n- **A. The mitotic spindle will completely depolymerize...** This is incorrect. The drug's action is specific to microtubule-kinetochore stability, not the stability of the microtubules that form the spindle itself.\n- **B. Kinetochores will be unable to form any attachments...** This is the opposite of the drug's effect. The drug *prevents the detachment* of incorrect attachments, leading to their stabilization, not a failure to attach in the first place.\n- **C. All chromosomes will successfully congress and align perfectly...** This is incorrect. The entire point of the error-correction mechanism is to ensure successful congression. Inhibiting it will lead to congression failure.\n- **D. The chromosomes will attach to spindle microtubules, but many will remain persistently misaligned, failing to organize correctly at the metaphase plate.** This prediction perfectly matches our analysis. Attachments form, but incorrect ones are not corrected, leading to widespread and persistent misalignment.\n- **E. The cell will proceed through metaphase and enter anaphase prematurely...** This is incorrect. The presence of unattached or improperly attached (low-tension) kinetochores activates the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC), which inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). This causes a *delay or arrest* in metaphase, preventing a premature entry into anaphase.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is the failure of chromosomes to align properly at the metaphase plate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2321384"}]}
