By meticulously tracking the two original DNA strands from a single chromosome through three rounds of cell division [@problem_id:2323743], you can directly visualize how genetic material is partitioned among descendants. This practice helps build a core mental model for the inheritance of parental DNA.", "problem": "The semiconservative model describes the mechanism of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication in all known cells. According to this model, the two strands of the parent DNA double helix unwind, and each strand serves as a template for the synthesis of a new, complementary strand. This results in two daughter DNA molecules, each consisting of one original (parental) strand and one newly synthesized strand.\n\nConsider a single eukaryotic cell containing exactly one chromosome. This cell and its descendants undergo three consecutive rounds of cell division, resulting in a total of eight cells. Assuming that DNA replication proceeds perfectly according to the semiconservative model during each cycle, determine how many of these eight final cells will contain at least one of the two original DNA strands from the single chromosome of the initial \"great-grandparent\" cell.", "solution": "Let the original chromosome in the initial parent cell be composed of two distinct DNA strands, which we can label as Strand 1 and Strand 2. The entire chromosome can be represented as (1, 2).\n\n**First Generation of Replication:**\nBefore the first cell division, the DNA of the chromosome (1, 2) replicates. The double helix unwinds, and each original strand serves as a template for a new strand.\n- Strand 1 is used as a template to form a new strand, let's call it 1'. This creates a new DNA molecule (1, 1').\n- Strand 2 is used as a template to form a new strand, let's call it 2'. This creates a second DNA molecule (2, 2').\n\nThe cell then divides, producing two daughter cells.\n- Daughter Cell A receives the chromosome (1, 1'). It contains one of the original strands (Strand 1).\n- Daughter Cell B receives the chromosome (2, 2'). It contains the other original strand (Strand 2).\nAt the end of the first generation, both (100%) of the two cells contain an original strand.\n\n**Second Generation of Replication:**\nNow, both Daughter Cell A and Daughter Cell B prepare to divide. Their DNA replicates.\n- In Cell A, the chromosome (1, 1') replicates. Strand 1 templates a new strand (1''), forming chromosome (1, 1''). Strand 1' templates a new strand (1'''), forming chromosome (1', 1'''). Cell A divides into two \"granddaughter\" cells. One gets (1, 1'') and thus contains the original Strand 1. The other gets (1', 1''') and contains no original strands.\n- In Cell B, the chromosome (2, 2') replicates. Strand 2 templates a new strand (2''), forming chromosome (2, 2''). Strand 2' templates a new strand (2'''), forming chromosome (2', 2'''). Cell B divides into two \"granddaughter\" cells. One gets (2, 2'') and thus contains the original Strand 2. The other gets (2', 2''') and contains no original strands.\n\nAt the end of the second generation, there are four cells in total. Two of these four cells contain an original strand (one has Strand 1, the other has Strand 2).\n\n**Third Generation of Replication:**\nThis process repeats for the third cell division, leading to eight \"great-granddaughter\" cells.\n- The cell from the second generation containing the original Strand 1, i.e., with chromosome (1, 1''), will divide. It produces one cell that inherits the original Strand 1 (in a new chromosome) and one cell that does not.\n- The cell from the second generation that had no original strand, i.e., with chromosome (1', 1'''), will divide. It produces two cells, neither of which can contain an original strand.\n- The cell from the second generation containing the original Strand 2, i.e., with chromosome (2, 2''), will divide. It produces one cell that inherits the original Strand 2 (in a new chromosome) and one cell that does not.\n- The cell from the second generation that had no original strand, i.e., with chromosome (2', 2'''), will divide. It produces two cells, neither of which can contain an original strand.\n\nAfter three generations, we have 8 cells. Tracing the original strands: Strand 1 is passed down to one of the eight cells. Strand 2 is passed down to another one of the eight cells. The other six cells are composed entirely of DNA synthesized in the subsequent generations.\n\nTherefore, exactly two of the eight final cells will contain one of the original DNA strands.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2323743"}, {"introduction": "A key part of the scientific process is evaluating competing hypotheses against experimental evidence. This problem asks you to step into the shoes of early molecular biologists and predict the outcome of a density-gradient experiment if DNA replication followed a hypothetical *conservative* model instead of a semiconservative one [@problem_id:2323746]. Comparing this hypothetical result to the actual experimental data reveals precisely why the Meselson-Stahl experiment was so conclusive in supporting the semiconservative model.", "problem": "An exploratory mission to a distant exoplanet has discovered a simple, single-celled organism. To understand its basic biology, scientists investigate its method of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication. Initially, the organisms are cultured for many generations in a medium containing a heavy isotope of nitrogen, $^{15}\\text{N}$, ensuring that all of their DNA is labeled with this heavy isotope.\n\nThese organisms are then transferred to a new medium containing only the lighter isotope, $^{14}\\text{N}$, and are allowed to undergo exactly two complete cycles of cell division (i.e., two generations of DNA replication). After these two generations, the DNA from the entire population of organisms is extracted, isolated, and analyzed using density-gradient centrifugation, a technique that separates DNA molecules into bands based on their density.\n\nIf this alien organism were to replicate its DNA using a **conservative replication** model, what would be the expected distribution of DNA bands in the density-gradient analysis?\n\nA.

Let the initial number of double-stranded DNA molecules be $N_{0}$, all of which are heavy duplexes, denoted $HH$.\n\nConservative replication principle: in each replication cycle, the parental duplex remains intact and a completely new duplex is synthesized from new nucleotides. Therefore, in a $^{14}\\text{N}$ medium, all newly synthesized strands are light, and no hybrid $HL$ duplexes are formed at any time.\n\nAfter the first generation (one replication cycle), each initial $HH$ molecule yields:\n- one conserved $HH$ molecule,\n- one newly synthesized $LL$ molecule (both strands light from the $^{14}\\text{N}$ pool).\n\nThus,\n$$\nN_{HH}(1)=N_{0}, \\quad N_{LL}(1)=N_{0}, \\quad N_{\\text{tot}}(1)=2N_{0}.\n$$\n\nAfter the second generation, each molecule present after the first generation replicates conservatively:\n- Each $HH$ produces one $HH$ (conserved) and one $LL$ (new), contributing $N_{HH}(1)$ to $N_{HH}(2)$ and $N_{HH}(1)$ to $N_{LL}(2)$.\n- Each $LL$ produces two $LL$ (one conserved parental $LL$ and one new $LL$), contributing $2N_{LL}(1)$ to $N_{LL}(2)$.\n\nTherefore,\n$$\nN_{HH}(2)=N_{HH}(1)=N_{0},\n$$\n$$\nN_{LL}(2)=N_{HH}(1)+2N_{LL}(1)=N_{0}+2N_{0}=3N_{0},\n$$\nand\n$$\nN_{\\text{tot}}(2)=N_{HH}(2)+N_{LL}(2)=N_{0}+3N_{0}=4N_{0}.\n$$\n\nThe density-gradient centrifugation outcome reflects these species and their proportions.

This exercise connects the high-level model to the mechanics of the replication fork, specifically the roles of the leading and lagging strands. By analyzing a scenario where the crucial enzyme DNA ligase is inhibited [@problem_id:2323786], you will explore how the nuts and bolts of the replication machinery influence the final molecular products revealed by techniques like gel electrophoresis.", "problem": "A circular, double-stranded plasmid Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule is engineered such that both of its strands are uniformly labeled with the heavy isotope of nitrogen, $^{15}\\text{N}$. This \"heavy\" plasmid is then introduced into a bacterial culture growing in a medium that contains only the light isotope of nitrogen, $^{14}\\text{N}$, as the sole nitrogen source for all metabolic processes, including the synthesis of new DNA. The growth medium is also supplemented with a specific chemical inhibitor that completely blocks the function of the enzyme DNA ligase. The bacteria are cultured under these conditions for a duration that allows for precisely one full round of plasmid replication to complete.\n\nFollowing this single replication cycle, the entire population of plasmids is isolated from the bacterial cells. The purified plasmid DNA is then treated with a denaturing agent that completely separates all double-stranded DNA into single strands. Finally, this mixture of single-stranded DNA molecules is loaded onto an agarose gel and subjected to electrophoresis, a technique that separates nucleic acid fragments primarily based on their size (length), with smaller fragments migrating faster and further through the gel than larger ones.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the pattern of bands that would be observed on the electrophoresis gel?\n\nA. A single band will be observed, corresponding to DNA of a size intermediate between the original plasmid strand and the newly synthesized fragments.\n\nB. Two distinct bands will be observed, both corresponding to high-molecular-weight DNA, with one migrating slightly slower than the other due to the mass difference between $^{15}\\text{N}$ and $^{14}\\text{N}$.\n\nC. Two bands will be observed: one band of high-molecular-weight DNA near the top of the gel, and a second, much faster-migrating, broader band or smear of low-molecular-weight DNA fragments.\n\nD.

A continuous smear of DNA will be observed along the entire length of the gel lane, with no distinct bands.", "solution": "Principles and initial conditions:\n- DNA replication is semiconservative: after one round, each duplex contains one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand.\n- The lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously as Okazaki fragments that require DNA ligase to seal nicks; inhibition of ligase prevents fragment joining.\n- Denaturation breaks hydrogen bonds between complementary strands but does not break covalent bonds; thus any unligated discontinuities yield separate single-stranded fragments upon denaturation.\n- Agarose gel electrophoresis separates nucleic acids primarily by length; the small mass difference between $^{15}\\text{N}$- and $^{14}\\text{N}$-labeled DNA does not resolve in agarose based on mass.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Start with a circular, double-stranded plasmid in which both strands are uniformly labeled with $^{15}\\text{N}$ (heavy).\n2. Shift to medium containing only $^{14}\\text{N}$ and a DNA ligase inhibitor; allow exactly one round of replication to complete.\n3. By semiconservative replication, each daughter duplex contains one original $^{15}\\text{N}$ parental strand (continuous, high molecular weight) and one newly synthesized $^{14}\\text{N}$ strand.\n4. With ligase inhibited:\n   - Lagging strands remain as multiple unligated Okazaki fragments, each bounded by nicks, though base-paired to the template in the duplex state.\n   - Leading strands are synthesized continuously but retain at least one nick where primer replacement cannot be sealed; functionally, after denaturation this yields one very long single-stranded fragment (nearly full plasmid length) plus a very short fragment.\n5. After isolation, denaturation separates all duplexes into single strands:\n   - The parental $^{15}\\text{N}$ strands remain intact, single-stranded, high-molecular-weight molecules.\n   - The nascent $^{14}\\text{N}$ lagging strands dissociate into many short single-stranded Okazaki fragments of a range of sizes.\n   - The nascent $^{14}\\text{N}$ leading strands contribute one near–full-length single-stranded fragment (co-migrating with high molecular weight) and one very small fragment (co-migrating with the small-fragment smear).\n6. In agarose electrophoresis, mobility is governed by length; isotope labeling ($^{15}\\text{N}$ versus $^{14}\\text{N}$) does not produce distinct bands by mass in agarose. Therefore:\n   - All near–full-length single strands (parental heavy strands and near–full-length leading-strand fragments) form a single, slow-migrating, high-molecular-weight band near the top.\n   - The numerous short Okazaki fragments (and tiny leading-strand patch fragments) form a faster-migrating, broad, low-molecular-weight band or smear.\n\nConclusion:\nThis pattern is best described by the presence of one high-molecular-weight band near the top and a separate, faster, broad smear of small fragments, matching option C. Options invoking isotope-based separation in agarose (B) or absence of small fragments (D) are inconsistent with ligase inhibition and agarose electrophoresis properties; a single intermediate band (A) or an entire-lane smear (E) also do not match the defined fragment population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2323786"}]}
