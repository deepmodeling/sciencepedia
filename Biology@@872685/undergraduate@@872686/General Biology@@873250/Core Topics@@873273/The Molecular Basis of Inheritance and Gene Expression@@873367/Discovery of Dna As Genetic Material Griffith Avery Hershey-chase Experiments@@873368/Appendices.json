The experiment uses two strains of *Streptococcus pneumoniae*: a virulent S-strain, which forms smooth colonies due to a polysaccharide capsule and is lethal to mice, and a non-virulent R-strain, which forms rough colonies and is harmless.\n\nAn extract is prepared from heat-killed S-strain bacteria. This extract, containing the potential transforming principle, is divided and used to create four different experimental mixtures. Each mixture is then combined with a culture of living R-strain bacteria. The compositions of the four setups are as follows:\n\n*   **Setup 1 (Positive Control):** S-strain extract is mixed with live R-strain bacteria.\n*   **Setup 2 (Protease Treatment):** S-strain extract is first treated with an active protease, an enzyme that specifically degrades proteins, and then mixed with live R-strain bacteria.\n*   **Setup 3 (RNase Treatment):** S-strain extract is first treated with an active RNase, an enzyme that specifically degrades ribonucleic acid (RNA), and then mixed with live R-strain bacteria.\n*   **Setup 4 (Modified DNase Treatment):** S-strain extract is first treated with a solution of DNase, an enzyme that specifically degrades deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). However, this particular DNase solution was heated to 95°C and then cooled to room temperature before being used. This high temperature is known to cause irreversible denaturation and complete inactivation of the DNase enzyme. This treated extract is then mixed with live R-strain bacteria.\n\nAfter a suitable incubation period, samples from each of the four setups are spread onto nutrient agar plates. The plates are then monitored for the appearance of smooth S-strain colonies, which would indicate that transformation has occurred. Assuming all other experimental conditions are ideal, in which of the setups would you expect to observe the growth of S-strain colonies?\n\nA. Setup 1 only\n\nB. Setups 1, 2, and 3 only\n\nC. Setups 1 and 4 only\n\nD. Setups 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\nE. Setup 4 only", "solution": "The core principle demonstrated by the Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment is that the transforming principle is DNA; therefore, transformation of R-strain to S-strain requires intact DNA from the S-strain extract. Any treatment that destroys proteins or RNA but leaves DNA intact will not prevent transformation, whereas active DNase that degrades DNA would abolish transformation.\n\nApply this principle to each setup:\n\nSetup 1 (Positive Control): The S-strain extract contains intact DNA. When mixed with live R-strain bacteria, DNA encoding capsule synthesis is taken up by R cells, producing S-strain colonies. Thus, S colonies appear.\n\nSetup 2 (Protease Treatment): Protease degrades proteins but does not affect DNA. The transforming DNA remains intact, so R cells can be transformed. S colonies appear.\n\nSetup 3 (RNase Treatment): RNase degrades RNA but does not affect DNA. The transforming DNA remains intact, so R cells can be transformed. S colonies appear.\n\nSetup 4 (Modified DNase Treatment): Although DNase would degrade DNA if active, the enzyme was heated to 95 degrees Celsius and irreversibly inactivated before use. Consequently, it cannot degrade DNA in the extract; the transforming DNA remains intact, and R cells can be transformed. S colonies appear.\n\nTherefore, S-strain colonies are expected in all four setups.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2290019"}, {"introduction": "The Hershey-Chase experiment elegantly confirmed DNA's role using bacteriophages, a completely different biological system. The genius of their work hinged on the specific choice of radioactive tracers: $^{32}\\text{P}$ for DNA and $^{35}\\text{S}$ for protein. This practice [@problem_id:2290008] asks you to consider a seemingly plausible alternative—labeling a DNA base with $^{14}\\text{C}$—to uncover the subtle but critical biochemical pitfalls that can confound experimental results and why the original choice of labels was so brilliant.", "problem": "In their classic 1952 experiment, Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase used radioisotopes to demonstrate that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and not protein, is the genetic material. They prepared two batches of T2 bacteriophage. In one batch, the phage protein coats were labeled with radioactive sulfur ($^{35}\\text{S}$). In the other, the phage DNA was labeled with radioactive phosphorus ($^{32}\\text{P}$).\n\nConsider a hypothetical version of this experiment where a research team attempts to replicate the study's goal. Instead of using $^{32}\\text{P}$, they decide to label the phage's nucleic acid by growing the host bacteria (and subsequently the phages) in a medium containing a specially synthesized guanine molecule labeled with carbon-14 ($^{14}\\text{C}$). All other nutrients, including amino acids, are supplied in non-radioactive form. The protein coats are still labeled separately in a parallel experiment using $^{35}\\text{S}$.\n\nAfter allowing the $^{14}\\text{C}$-labeled phages to infect a new batch of non-radioactive bacteria, the mixture is agitated in a blender to detach the phage coats and then centrifuged to separate the bacterial cells (pellet) from the liquid medium (supernatant). Which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected distribution of $^{14}\\text{C}$ and the fundamental ambiguity this would introduce to the experiment's conclusion?\n\nA. The $^{14}\\text{C}$ would be found almost exclusively in the supernatant, because guanine is a small molecule that is not incorporated into the primary structure of DNA and would be detached with the protein coat. This would lead to the incorrect conclusion that protein is the genetic material.\n\nB. The $^{14}\\text{C}$ would be found almost exclusively in the bacterial pellet, providing a clear and unambiguous result that nucleic acid is the genetic material, making it an equally valid alternative to using $^{32}\\text{P}$.\n\nC. Radioactivity from $^{14}\\text{C}$ would be detected in both the pellet and the supernatant. This is because bacterial metabolism can break down the supplied $^{14}\\text{C}$-guanine and reutilize the radioactive carbon atoms to synthesize amino acids, thereby labeling the phage protein coats as well as the DNA.\n\nD. The $^{14}\\text{C}$ would not be incorporated into the phage at all, because guanine is a component of ribonucleic acid (RNA), not DNA. The experiment would yield no radioactive signal in either the pellet or the supernatant.", "solution": "The original Hershey–Chase logic depends on element-specific labeling: $^{32}\\text{P}$ labels nucleic acids because DNA and RNA contain phosphate in their backbones while proteins generally do not contain phosphorus, and $^{35}\\text{S}$ labels protein because sulfur is present in methionine and cysteine but not in nucleic acids. This element-level specificity prevents metabolic redistribution from obscuring the interpretation.\n\nWhen $^{14}\\text{C}$-labeled guanine is used as the sole radioactive precursor for labeling the phage nucleic acid:\n1) Salvage pathway incorporation: Bacteria can salvage guanine into guanylate nucleotides, which are then used to synthesize phage DNA. This yields $^{14}\\text{C}$ in the phage DNA. Upon infection and blender treatment, the labeled DNA that is injected into bacteria will be found in the pellet.\n2) Catabolic redistribution (metabolic scrambling): Bacteria can also catabolize guanine. In many bacteria, guanine is deaminated to xanthine and further degraded through purine catabolic pathways to smaller metabolites such as glyoxylate and $\\text{CO}_2$. The carbon skeletons enter central metabolism (including the tricarboxylic acid cycle and associated biosynthetic routes) and can be reutilized to synthesize diverse biomolecules, including amino acids. Even if non-radioactive amino acids are supplied, bacteria frequently continue some de novo synthesis and interconversion; moreover, carbon from $^{14}\\text{C}$-guanine can enter amino acid pools indirectly via central metabolic intermediates. Consequently, phage proteins produced in these hosts can also acquire $^{14}\\text{C}$.\n\nTherefore, the batch of phage grown on $^{14}\\text{C}$-guanine–exposed bacteria will likely carry radioactivity in both its DNA (by salvage) and its protein (by metabolic redistribution). After infection of unlabeled bacteria and blender separation:\n- The bacterial pellet will contain $^{14}\\text{C}$ from the injected phage DNA.\n- The supernatant will also contain $^{14}\\text{C}$ because the detached phage protein coats are at least partially labeled via recycled $^{14}\\text{C}$ incorporated into amino acids during phage assembly.\n\nThis distribution introduces a fundamental ambiguity: the presence of $^{14}\\text{C}$ in both pellet and supernatant prevents a clean conclusion that only DNA enters the cell and carries genetic information. This contrasts with $^{32}\\text{P}$, which avoids such scrambling because phosphorus from phosphate does not redistribute into protein under normal conditions.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: guanine is a canonical DNA base and is incorporated into the primary structure of DNA; it would not be detached as a small molecule with the coat in a way that excludes DNA labeling.\n- B is incorrect: due to metabolic scrambling, $^{14}\\text{C}$ will not be exclusive to DNA, so results are not unambiguous.\n- C is correct: both pellet and supernatant will show $^{14}\\text{C}$, creating ambiguity in interpreting which macromolecule is the genetic material.\n- D is incorrect: guanine is a base in both RNA and DNA; it is not exclusive to RNA, and it can be incorporated into DNA.\n\nThus, the expected distribution and the key ambiguity are best described by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2290008"}, {"introduction": "Textbook diagrams often present an idealized version of scientific experiments, but laboratory reality is frequently more complex. This final practice moves beyond qualitative predictions to a quantitative analysis of the Hershey-Chase experiment [@problem_id:2290021]. By incorporating realistic inefficiencies in DNA injection and physical separation, you will model how raw experimental data is generated, providing a deeper appreciation for how scientists draw firm conclusions from imperfect results.", "problem": "In a modern variant of the Hershey-Chase experiment, two separate batches of bacteriophages are prepared. In the first batch, the phage protein coats are labeled with the radioactive isotope $^{35}\\text{S}$. In the second batch, the phage DNA is labeled with $^{32}\\text{P}$. These phages are then used to infect a culture of *E. coli*.\n\nAssume the experiment proceeds with the following known inefficiencies:\n1.  The injection of phage genetic material into the bacterial host is only 90% efficient. This means for every 10 phages that attach to a bacterium, only 9 successfully inject their DNA, while 1 phage remains attached without injecting its DNA.\n2.  The subsequent blending step, designed to shear phage particles from the bacterial surfaces, is only 60% efficient. This means that for any phage particles attached to the outside of the bacteria at the time of blending, 60% are successfully detached, while 40% remain firmly attached.\n\nFollowing blending, the culture is centrifuged to separate the bacterial cells (pellet) from the liquid medium containing detached phage particles (supernatant). All bacterial cells are found in the pellet, and all detached phage particles are found in the supernatant.\n\nBased on this scenario, calculate the fraction of the total initial $^{35}\\text{S}$ found in the pellet, the fraction of total initial $^{35}\\text{S}$ in the supernatant, the fraction of total initial $^{32}\\text{P}$ in the pellet, and the fraction of total initial $^{32}\\text{P}$ in the supernatant.
