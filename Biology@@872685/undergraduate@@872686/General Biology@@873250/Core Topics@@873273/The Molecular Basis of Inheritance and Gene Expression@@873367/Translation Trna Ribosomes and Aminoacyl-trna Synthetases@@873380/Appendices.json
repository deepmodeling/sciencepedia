They construct an engineered Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule. This molecule possesses the complete structure of a native tRNA that is normally charged with the amino acid Glycine ($tRNA^{\\text{Gly}}$), including its characteristic acceptor stem and D-loop. However, they have specifically mutated the three-nucleotide anticodon sequence to be 5'-GCA-3', which is the anticodon that pairs with a codon for Cysteine.

The tRNA will not be charged with any amino acid, as it is structurally invalid.\n\nE. The tRNA will be mis-charged with a different amino acid, such as Alanine.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict which amino acid will be attached to a specially engineered tRNA molecule. This process, known as tRNA charging or aminoacylation, is catalyzed by a family of enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs). Each aaRS is specific for one type of amino acid and its corresponding set of tRNAs. The specificity of this reaction is crucial for the fidelity of protein synthesis and is often referred to as the \"second genetic code\".\n\nFirst, let's analyze the components of the experiment. We have an engineered tRNA, all 20 amino acids, and the complete set of aaRS enzymes from *E. coli*. The key component is the engineered tRNA, which has a \"chimeric\" nature:\n1.  **tRNA Body:** The main structure, including the acceptor stem, D-loop, and T-loop, is identical to that of a native tRNA for Glycine ($tRNA^{\\text{Gly}}$).\n2.  **tRNA Anticodon:** The anticodon has been changed to 5'-GCA-3', which base-pairs with the UGC codon for Cysteine.\n\nNext, we must consider how the different aaRS enzymes will interact with this engineered tRNA. The problem states that there are specific features on a tRNA, called \"identity elements,\" that an aaRS enzyme recognizes to ensure it charges the correct tRNA with the correct amino acid.\n\nLet's evaluate the interaction with the Glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS). The problem explicitly states that for GlyRS in *E. coli*, the critical identity elements are located in the acceptor stem, and the anticodon plays only a minor role. Our engineered tRNA has the native acceptor stem of $tRNA^{\\text{Gly}}$. Therefore, GlyRS will recognize these primary identity elements and correctly identify the \"body\" of the tRNA as its substrate. Despite the \"wrong\" anticodon, the strong recognition signals in the acceptor stem will lead GlyRS to bind to this tRNA and catalyze the attachment of Glycine.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the interaction with the Cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CysRS). The problem states that CysRS uses the anticodon as a major identity element. Our engineered tRNA possesses the correct anticodon for $tRNA^{\\text{Cys}}$ (5'-GCA-3'). Consequently, CysRS will recognize this anticodon. However, the rest of the tRNA molecule (the body) does not possess the other identity elements characteristic of a true $tRNA^{\\text{Cys}}$. The binding of an aaRS to a tRNA is a complex interaction involving multiple contact points. While CysRS will be attracted to the correct anticodon, the mismatch with the rest of the tRNA body will likely result in a much less stable or efficient interaction compared to its interaction with a native $tRNA^{\\text{Cys}}$.\n\nThe question asks what will be *predominantly* observed. We have a competition: GlyRS recognizes the tRNA body, and CysRS recognizes the anticodon. The provided information tells us that the identity elements in the acceptor stem are \"critical\" for GlyRS recognition, implying a very strong and specific interaction. Although the anticodon is a \"major\" identity element for CysRS, recognition is rarely based on a single element. The overall binding affinity and catalytic efficiency of an aaRS are determined by the sum of interactions with all identity elements. In this case, the GlyRS has its most important recognition sites satisfied by the $tRNA^{\\text{Gly}}$ body, leading to efficient binding and charging. The CysRS only has one of its major sites satisfied (the anticodon) while the rest of the tRNA body is incorrect, likely leading to a weaker, less productive interaction.\n\nTherefore, the GlyRS will outcompete the CysRS in charging this engineered tRNA. The tRNA will be predominantly charged with Glycine. This charged tRNA, if it were to participate in translation, would then incorrectly insert a Glycine at a position coded for Cysteine in the messenger RNA (mRNA), demonstrating the critical role of aaRS fidelity.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n-   Option A is correct because the GlyRS primarily recognizes the acceptor stem, which is that of a $tRNA^{\\text{Gly}}$.\n-   Option B is incorrect because recognition by CysRS would be inefficient due to the incorrect tRNA body.\n-   Option C is incorrect because the recognition efficiencies are not equal; the interaction with GlyRS is much stronger.\n-   Option D is incorrect because the molecule is a valid substrate for at least GlyRS.\n-   Option E is unsupported by the information provided.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2324961"}, {"introduction": "The ribosome can be pictured as a molecular factory with a three-stop assembly line: the A (Aminoacyl), P (Peptidyl), and E (Exit) sites, which guide the flow of tRNAs during elongation. To truly understand this dynamic process, it helps to see what happens when the machinery is disrupted. This problem [@problem_id:2324969] presents a hypothetical scenario where the E-site is blocked, allowing you to pinpoint its precise function and deduce the state of the ribosome when the crucial step of translocation fails.", "problem": "A new hypothetical antibiotic called Translocase Inhibitor Factor (TIF) is being studied for its effect on bacterial protein synthesis. Its sole mechanism of action is to bind to and structurally obstruct the E-site (Exit site) of the ribosome, preventing any tRNA molecule from entering this site.\n\nConsider a single ribosome that is actively translating an mRNA molecule within a bacterium that has been exposed to TIF. This ribosome has just completed the peptidyl transferase reaction, forming a new peptide bond. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate state of this ribosome as it attempts the next step in the elongation cycle?\n\nA. The ribosome will stall with the uncharged tRNA in the P-site and the peptidyl-tRNA in the A-site.\n\nB. The ribosome will successfully complete translocation, but the uncharged tRNA will be unable to exit the now-blocked E-site, causing subsequent cycles to fail.\n\nC. The uncharged tRNA will be ejected directly from the P-site, allowing translation to proceed, albeit less efficiently.\n\nD. The ribosome will stall, but only after the peptidyl-tRNA has moved to the P-site, leaving the A-site empty.\n\nE. The formation of the most recent peptide bond will be reversed, and the original aminoacyl-tRNA will be released from the A-site.", "solution": "Step 1: Immediately after the peptidyl transferase reaction, the ribosome has a deacylated (uncharged) tRNA in the **P-site** and a peptidyl-tRNA in the **A-site**. This is the canonical post-peptidyl transfer state of the elongation cycle in bacteria.\n\nStep 2: The next step is translocation, which is catalyzed by EF-G bound to GTP. Translocation involves:\n- Formation of hybrid states on the large subunit: the peptidyl-tRNA shifts from the **A-site** to the A/P hybrid state, and the deacylated tRNA shifts from the **P-site** to the P/E hybrid state.\n- Subsequent movement of the small subunit relative to the large subunit, advancing the mRNA by one codon, yielding the final classical states: peptidyl-tRNA in the **P-site** and deacylated tRNA in the **E-site**, with the **A-site** vacated.\n\nStep 3: Because TIF blocks the **E-site**, the deacylated tRNA cannot occupy the **E-site**. This obstruction prevents the $P \\rightarrow E$ movement that is integral both to the hybrid P/E intermediate and to completion of translocation. Without access to the **E-site**, EF-G cannot drive the tRNAs and mRNA into their translocated positions.\n\nStep 4: Consequently, the ribosome stalls before translocation occurs. The immediate state remains the post-peptidyl transfer pre-translocation configuration: deacylated tRNA in the **P-site** and peptidyl-tRNA in the **A-site**.\n\nStep 5: Evaluating the options:\n- A: Correct. This matches the predicted stall before translocation: uncharged tRNA in the **P-site**, peptidyl-tRNA in the **A-site**.\n- B: Incorrect. Completion of translocation requires movement of the deacylated tRNA into the **E-site**; if the **E-site** is blocked, translocation cannot complete.\n- C: Incorrect. There is no direct ejection path from the **P-site** that bypasses the **E-site** in the normal mechanism; release occurs after $P \\rightarrow E$ movement.\n- D: Incorrect. Movement of the peptidyl-tRNA to the **P-site** is coupled to the deacylated tRNA moving to the **E-site**; with the **E-site** blocked, this step cannot proceed.\n- E: Incorrect. The peptidyl transfer reaction is not reversed under physiological elongation; the process does not backtrack in this manner.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2324969"}, {"introduction": "For a cell, the efficiency of protein synthesis is just as vital as its accuracy, as it dictates how quickly essential proteins can be produced.

The messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts produced from these genes, `mRNA_A` and `mRNA_B`, are of the exact same length.\n\n- `mRNA_A` codes for a highly abundant cytosolic protein. An analysis of its sequence reveals that it exclusively uses codons that are recognized by the most abundant transfer RNA (tRNA) species in the cell.\n- `mRNA_B` codes for a specialized transcription factor. Its sequence is notable for a high frequency of \"rare\" codons, which are recognized by the least abundant tRNA species available in the cell.\n\nTo compare the translational status of these two mRNAs, the scientist performs a polysome profiling experiment. In this technique, a total cell lysate is prepared under conditions that preserve mRNA-ribosome complexes (polysomes). This lysate is then layered on top of a continuous sucrose density gradient and subjected to ultracentrifugation. This process separates molecules based on their size and density; larger, denser complexes sediment further down the tube.

Both `mRNA_A` and `mRNA_B` will be found together in the heavy fractions because their mRNA molecules are the same length.\n\nD. Both `mRNA_A` and `mRNA_B` will be found together in the light fractions because the rate of translation is limited by initiation, not codon usage.\n\nE. `mRNA_A` and `mRNA_B` will show identical distributions across the gradient, as ribosome density is determined by mRNA length alone.", "solution": "Polysome profiling separates mRNA–ribosome complexes by mass and density after ultracentrifugation in a sucrose gradient. An mRNA bound by many ribosomes (a heavy polysome) sediments to heavier fractions; an mRNA with few or no ribosomes sediments to lighter fractions. Thus, the observed position depends primarily on ribosome occupancy per mRNA.\n\nTranslation principles:\n- The elongation rate depends on tRNA availability. Let the codon-dependent elongation rate be $k_{e}$; abundant cognate tRNAs increase $k_{e}$, whereas rare tRNAs decrease $k_{e}$.\n- The time a ribosome spends traversing an mRNA of length $L$ codons is $T=\\frac{L}{k_{e}}$.\n- Initiation can be inhibited by ribosome occlusion near the start codon; slow elongation (small $k_{e}$) increases dwell time near the $5'$ end, reducing effective initiation frequency and overall ribosome loading. Conversely, fast elongation (large $k_{e}$) clears the start region rapidly, permitting frequent initiation and higher steady-state ribosome occupancy.\n- Therefore, efficient codon usage promotes high effective initiation and high ribosome occupancy, whereas rare codons promote ribosome pausing, lower effective initiation, and reduced polysome association.\n\nApplication to the two mRNAs (same $L$):\n- For `mRNA_A`: exclusive use of codons recognized by the most abundant tRNAs implies large $k_{e}$ and minimal pausing. Rapid clearance of the initiation region allows frequent initiation cycles and high ribosome occupancy, yielding heavy polysome association (heavier fractions).\n- For `mRNA_B`: enrichment for rare codons implies small $k_{e}$, frequent pauses, and occlusion that suppresses effective initiation and reduces the number of ribosomes per mRNA. These mRNAs are expected to be in lighter fractions.\n\nEliminating alternatives:\n- Same length (options C and E) does not fix ribosome density; translational dynamics set ribosome occupancy.\n- While initiation can often be rate-limiting, codon usage directly modulates elongation and feeds back on initiation via occlusion; thus option D is not generally correct.\n\nTherefore, the most likely observation is that `mRNA_A` is predominantly in heavy fractions and `mRNA_B` in light fractions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2324986"}]}
