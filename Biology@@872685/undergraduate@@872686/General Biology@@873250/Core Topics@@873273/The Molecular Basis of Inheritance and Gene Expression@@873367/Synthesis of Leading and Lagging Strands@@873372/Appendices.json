Both Strand 1 and Strand 2 are templates for lagging strand synthesis at this fork.\nE. It is impossible to determine the roles of the strands without more information about the helicase.", "solution": "The solution to this problem requires applying the fundamental principles of DNA replication.\n\nFirst, let's recall the key rules governing DNA synthesis:\n1.  **Directionality of Synthesis**: DNA polymerases can only synthesize new DNA by adding nucleotides to the $3'$ end of a growing strand. This means synthesis always proceeds in the $5' \\to 3'$ direction.\n2.  **Antiparallel Template**: DNA polymerases read a template strand in its $3' \\to 5'$ direction to synthesize a new, complementary antiparallel strand in the $5' \\to 3'$ direction.\n3.  **Leading vs. Lagging Strand**: The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the same direction as the movement of the replication fork. The lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously in short segments (Okazaki fragments) in the overall opposite direction to the replication fork's movement.\n\nThe problem specifies the two strands:\nStrand 1: 5' - ... - 3'\nStrand 2: 3' - ... - 5'\n\nWe are asked to consider the replication fork moving to the right. Let's visualize the strands as the fork moves rightward:\nThe fork's movement is from left to right.\nThe top strand, Strand 1, has a polarity of $5' \\to 3'$ from left to right.\nThe bottom strand, Strand 2, has a polarity of $3' \\to 5'$ from left to right.\n\nNow, let's determine the template for the leading strand. The leading strand must be synthesized continuously in the same direction as the fork's movement, which is to the right. For a new strand to be synthesized from $5' \\to 3'$ in the rightward direction, the polymerase must read a template strand that is oriented $3' \\to 5'$ in that same rightward direction.\n\nLooking at the two template strands:\n- Strand 1 is oriented $5' \\to 3'$ in the direction of the fork's movement (left to right).\n- Strand 2 is oriented $3' \\to 5'$ in the direction of the fork's movement (left to right).\n\nSince the polymerase needs a $3' \\to 5'$ template to synthesize continuously towards the fork, Strand 2 is the correct template for the leading strand. The new DNA strand will be synthesized continuously $5' \\to 3'$ using Strand 2 as the guide.\n\nNext, let's determine the template for the lagging strand. By elimination, the lagging strand template must be Strand 1. Let's verify this. The lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously, in fragments, with an overall direction opposite to the fork movement. This means the polymerase must synthesize short strands moving from right to left, away from the advancing fork.\n\nTo synthesize a new DNA fragment from right to left (in the $5' \\to 3'$ direction), the polymerase must read the template strand from left to right (in its $3' \\to 5'$ direction). Strand 1 is oriented $5' \\to 3'$ from left to right. As the fork unwinds more of the DNA to the right, a single-stranded portion of Strand 1 becomes available. The polymerase will bind to this template and synthesize a short Okazaki fragment away from the fork (i.e., to the left). This synthesis is possible because the polymerase reads a segment of Strand 1 that has a $3'$-to-$5'$ polarity *relative to the direction of synthesis*. This process is discontinuous and consistent with lagging strand synthesis.\n\nTherefore, for the right-moving replication fork:\n- The leading strand is synthesized using Strand 2 as a template.\n- The lagging strand is synthesized using Strand 1 as a template.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2316184"}, {"introduction": "The discontinuous synthesis of the lagging strand produces a series of separate Okazaki fragments that must be processed and joined to form a continuous DNA molecule. This multistep process requires a coordinated effort from several enzymes, each with a highly specific function. This problem-solving exercise [@problem_id:2316160] challenges you to act as a molecular detective, using a set of experimental observations from a mutant organism to pinpoint a deficiency in a key enzyme, thereby reinforcing the indispensable role of DNA ligase in completing lagging strand synthesis.", "problem": "A molecular biology research team is studying DNA replication in a newly discovered eukaryotic microbe. They isolate a mutant strain that exhibits a specific defect during cell division. When they analyze the DNA replication process in this mutant, they make the following key observations:\n1. The replication fork is established, and the parental DNA double helix is successfully unwound.\n2. The leading strand is synthesized continuously without any apparent issues.\n3. On the lagging strand, short DNA segments, known as Okazaki fragments, are synthesized.\n4. The RNA primers at the beginning of each Okazaki fragment are successfully excised and replaced with the corresponding DNA sequence.\n5. Despite the replacement of primers, the newly synthesized DNA on the lagging strand remains as a collection of separate, adjacent fragments rather than being joined into a single continuous strand.\n\nBased on this specific set of observations, a functional deficiency in which of the following enzymes is the most likely cause of the observed phenotype in the mutant strain?\n\nA. DNA Polymerase I\nB. Helicase\nC. DNA Polymerase III\nD. Primase\nE. DNA Ligase", "solution": "The observations specify that the replication fork forms and the parental duplex is unwound, which demonstrates functional helicase activity; therefore, option B is excluded. The leading strand is continuously synthesized, indicating that the principal replicative polymerase on the leading strand is active; thus, a defect in the main replicative polymerase (option C) is unlikely. On the lagging strand, Okazaki fragments are synthesized, which requires primase to lay RNA primers and a DNA polymerase to extend from those primers; therefore, primase is functional and option D is excluded. The RNA primers are successfully excised and replaced with DNA, which is the combined activity typically attributed in prokaryotes to DNA polymerase I and in eukaryotes to RNase H/FEN1 with a DNA polymerase such as polymerase delta; therefore, the primer removal and gap-filling step is intact, making a defect in DNA polymerase I (option A, by analogy for primer removal) inconsistent with the findings. The only remaining step required to convert adjacent, primer-replaced Okazaki fragments into a continuous lagging strand is sealing the remaining nicks between fragments by forming phosphodiester bonds between the $3'$ hydroxyl and $5'$ phosphate ends. That reaction is catalyzed by DNA ligase, which uses ATP in eukaryotes to join DNA fragments. The persistence of separate, adjacent DNA fragments after successful primer removal and replacement indicates failure of this nick-sealing step, consistent with a deficiency in DNA ligase. Therefore, the most likely defective enzyme is DNA ligase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2316160"}, {"introduction": "The ability of DNA polymerase to extend a DNA chain is dependent on a specific chemical requirement at the growing end of the strand. This requirement is the absolute basis for DNA synthesis and explains why elongation proceeds in a specific direction. By exploring a hypothetical scenario where standard nucleotides are replaced by chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides [@problem_id:2316195], this exercise illuminates the critical role of the $3'$-hydroxyl group in forming phosphodiester bonds and provides a conceptual link to the mechanism behind Sanger sequencing.", "problem": "A molecular biology student is conducting an experiment using a simplified *in vitro* DNA replication system. The system contains a linear double-stranded DNA template, DNA helicase, DNA primase, DNA polymerase, DNA ligase, and a buffer providing optimal conditions. The student prepares two reaction mixtures. The control mixture contains an ample supply of all four standard deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). The experimental mixture is identical to the control, except that the entire supply of dNTPs has been replaced with a corresponding set of dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs). These ddNTPs are structural analogues of dNTPs but lack the hydroxyl (-OH) group at the $3'$ position of the deoxyribose sugar. The supply of ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs) required for priming remains available and unchanged in both mixtures.\n\nAssuming replication is allowed to initiate at a single origin of replication in the center of the linear template, what would be the most accurate description of the immediate outcome in the experimental mixture compared to the control?\n\nA. DNA synthesis would fail to initiate because DNA primase cannot function in the presence of ddNTPs.\nB. Leading strand synthesis would proceed normally to the end of the template, but lagging strand synthesis would be completely blocked.\nC. Synthesis would initiate at each RNA primer on both the leading and lagging strands, but would terminate immediately after the incorporation of the first dideoxynucleotide.\nD. Both strands would be synthesized into long chains of DNA, but the final step of joining the Okazaki fragments by DNA ligase would fail.\nE. DNA polymerase would bind to the primers but would be unable to add even a single ddNTP, effectively stalling the entire process before any new strand material is made.", "solution": "The replication system contains helicase, primase, polymerase, ligase, and a linear double-stranded DNA with a single origin in the center. In both mixtures, helicase unwinds the DNA and primase synthesizes short RNA primers because primase uses ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs), which are present and unchanged.\n\nDNA polymerase extends an RNA-primed $3'$ end by the two-metal-ion mechanism, in which the $3'$-hydroxyl of the primer strand performs a nucleophilic attack on the incoming nucleotide’s alpha phosphate to form a new phosphodiester bond and release pyrophosphate. Symbolically, with normal substrates:\n$$\n\\text{(DNA)}_{n}\\text{-}3'\\text{OH} + \\text{dNTP} \\rightarrow \\text{(DNA)}_{n+1}\\text{-}3'\\text{OH} + \\text{PP}_{\\text{i}}.\n$$\nIn the experimental mixture, all dNTPs are replaced with ddNTPs, which lack the $3'$-OH on the sugar. DNA polymerase can still incorporate a ddNTP as the first nucleotide onto an RNA primer because the primer provides the initial $3'$-OH needed for the reaction:\n$$\n\\text{(DNA)}_{n}\\text{-}3'\\text{OH} + \\text{ddNTP} \\rightarrow \\text{(DNA)}_{n+1}\\text{-}3'\\text{H} + \\text{PP}_{\\text{i}}.\n$$\nHowever, after this incorporation, the newly formed primer terminus lacks a $3'$-OH (it has $3'$-H), so no further nucleotides can be added. Therefore, synthesis initiates at each RNA primer but terminates immediately after the first ddNTP is incorporated.\n\nApplying this to both forks emerging from the central origin:\n- Leading strands: each begins with an RNA primer; polymerase adds a single ddNTP to that primer and then stops.\n- Lagging strands: each Okazaki fragment begins with an RNA primer; polymerase adds a single ddNTP to each new primer and then stops.\n\nEliminating the options:\n- A is incorrect because primase uses rNTPs and is not blocked by ddNTP substitution.\n- B is incorrect because leading strand elongation cannot proceed normally; it terminates after the first ddNTP.\n- C is correct: initiation occurs at each RNA primer on both strands, followed by immediate termination after the first ddNTP.\n- D is incorrect because long DNA chains are not synthesized in the absence of dNTPs; ligase action is irrelevant.\n- E is incorrect because DNA polymerase can incorporate a ddNTP once (as in Sanger sequencing) before termination.\n\nThus, the most accurate description is that synthesis initiates at each RNA primer but halts immediately after the first ddNTP incorporation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2316195"}]}
