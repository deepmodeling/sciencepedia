Its primary transcript (pre-mRNA) contains five exons. Through alternative splicing, two different mature mRNA molecules are produced in the cell. The first, `mRNA-A`, represents the canonical transcript containing all five exons. The second, `mRNA-B`, is an isoform where exon 3 is precisely skipped, causing exon 2 to be joined directly to exon 4. Analysis reveals that the skipped exon 3 is exactly 63 nucleotides long. Both `mRNA-A` and `mRNA-B` are stable and successfully translated into `Protein-A` and `Protein-B`, respectively. The start codon for translation is located in exon 1 and the stop codon is located in exon 5.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate description of `Protein-B` compared to `Protein-A`?\n\nA. `Protein-B` will be shorter than `Protein-A` by 21 amino acids, and the sequence of amino acids coded by exons 4 and 5 will be identical to that in `Protein-A`.\n\nB. The splicing event that creates `mRNA-B` will cause a shift in the translational reading frame, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence for the part of the protein coded by exons 4 and 5, likely resulting in a severely truncated protein.\n\nC. `Protein-B` will be shorter than `Protein-A` by exactly 63 amino acids.\n\nD. The ribosome will be unable to translate `mRNA-B` past the novel junction between exon 2 and exon 4, resulting in a very short, non-functional protein fragment containing only the amino acids coded by exons 1 and 2.\n\nE. The amino acid sequence of `Protein-B` will be identical to `Protein-A` because the splicing machinery automatically inserts filler nucleotides to preserve the reading frame.", "solution": "The genetic code is read in non-overlapping triplets (codons), so translation proceeds in a fixed reading frame determined by the start codon in exon 1. A deletion or insertion that changes the coding sequence by a number of nucleotides not divisible by 3 causes a frameshift; conversely, removal of a segment whose length is a multiple of 3 preserves the reading frame.\n\nLet the length of exon 3 be $L_{E3}=63$ nucleotides. Since each codon has length $c=3$ nucleotides, the number of codons encoded by exon 3 is\n$$\nn_{\\Delta}=\\frac{L_{E3}}{c}=\\frac{63}{3}=21.\n$$\nSkipping exon 3 therefore removes exactly $21$ codons from the open reading frame without altering the downstream reading frame, because\n$$\nL_{E3}\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}.\n$$\nThus, the length of Protein-B relative to Protein-A satisfies\n$$\nN_{B}=N_{A}-21,\n$$\nwhere $N_{A}$ and $N_{B}$ are the amino acid lengths of Protein-A and Protein-B, respectively. Because the reading frame is preserved, the codon boundaries at the exon 2–exon 4 junction align with the original frame, and the codon sequences in exons 4 and 5 are identical to those in the canonical mRNA-A. The start codon in exon 1 and stop codon in exon 5 remain correctly positioned in-frame, so translation proceeds normally through exons 4 and 5 with unchanged amino acid sequence in those regions.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is correct: Protein-B is shorter by $21$ amino acids, and the amino acid sequences encoded by exons 4 and 5 are identical to Protein-A.\n- Option B is incorrect because there is no frameshift when $63$ nucleotides (a multiple of $3$) are removed.\n- Option C is incorrect because $63$ nucleotides correspond to $21$ amino acids, not $63$ amino acids.\n- Option D is incorrect because ribosomes translate contiguous codons across exon-exon junctions; the junction does not impede translation when the frame is preserved.\n- Option E is incorrect because the splicing machinery does not insert filler nucleotides; frame preservation here results from the exon length being a multiple of $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2294332"}, {"introduction": "Studying gene expression often requires distinguishing between the initial, unprocessed pre-mRNA and the final, mature mRNA. How can a researcher design an experiment to specifically measure only the unprocessed transcripts?

The primary goal of the experiment is to specifically quantify the amount of unprocessed precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) transcribed from *Gene X*, while ensuring that the fully processed, mature messenger RNA (mRNA) is not detected. To achieve this specificity, the researcher intends to use a labeled, single-stranded DNA probe that will hybridize (bind) to its complementary RNA sequence within the cell.\n\nWhich of the following would be the most effective target sequence for designing a probe that binds exclusively to the unprocessed pre-mRNA of *Gene X*?\n\nA.

The defining difference between pre-mRNA and mature mRNA in eukaryotes is the presence of introns in pre-mRNA and their absence after splicing in mature mRNA.\n\nPrinciples:\n1. Pre-mRNA contains both exons and introns; mature mRNA contains only exons after splicing.\n2. A probe complementary to exon sequence will hybridize to both pre-mRNA and mature mRNA.\n3. A probe complementary to intron sequence will hybridize only to pre-mRNA, because introns are removed in mature mRNA.\n4. An exon-exon junction sequence exists only in mature mRNA and thus detects mature mRNA specifically.\n5. The 3' poly-A tail is not unique to Gene X and is present on most mature mRNAs; it can also be added to pre-mRNA after cleavage and polyadenylation, so it is not exclusive to unspliced transcripts.\n6. The 5' UTR is exonic and therefore present in both pre-mRNA and mature mRNA.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A: Exonic sequence is present in both pre-mRNA and mature mRNA; not specific for pre-mRNA.\n- B: Intronic sequence is present only in pre-mRNA; this yields exclusive binding to pre-mRNA and avoids mature mRNA.\n- C: Poly-A tail is shared across many mRNAs and can be present on pre-mRNA post-cleavage; not gene-specific and not exclusive to pre-mRNA.\n- D: Exon-exon junction is created by splicing; this would detect mature mRNA, the opposite of the goal.\n- E: 5' UTR is exonic; present in both transcript forms; not specific.\n\nConclusion: A probe targeting a sequence located entirely within an intron will bind exclusively to unprocessed pre-mRNA and not to mature mRNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2294327"}, {"introduction": "In the era of genomics, interpreting sequence data is as crucial as performing wet-lab experiments. A fundamental task is to map the structure of a gene by comparing its genomic DNA sequence to its transcribed mRNA sequence. This final practice [@problem_id:2294334] puts you in the role of a bioinformatician, tasking you with deducing the exon-intron architecture of a gene from computational alignment data, thereby synthesizing the core concepts of RNA splicing in a practical context.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating the structure of a novel gene, designated `Gene-Y`, in a eukaryotic organism. They have successfully sequenced a 10,000 base pair (bp) segment of genomic DNA (gDNA) that contains the entire gene. They have also generated a complementary DNA (cDNA) library from mature messenger RNA (mRNA) isolated from the organism's cells and have sequenced the specific cDNA corresponding to `Gene-Y`. The resulting cDNA sequence is 1,500 bp long.\n\nTo map the gene's architecture, the biologist performs a computational alignment of the 1,500 bp cDNA sequence against the 10,000 bp gDNA sequence. The alignment software reports three distinct, non-overlapping High-Scoring Segment Pairs (HSPs). An HSP represents a contiguous region of high sequence similarity between the two sequences. The coordinates of these alignments are reported as follows (positions are 1-indexed):\n\n*   **HSP 1:** cDNA positions 1 to 500 align with gDNA positions 1,201 to 1,700.\n*   **HSP 2:** cDNA positions 501 to 900 align with gDNA positions 4,501 to 4,900.\n*   **HSP 3:** cDNA positions 901 to 1,500 align with gDNA positions 8,101 to 8,700.\n\nBased exclusively on this alignment data, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and justifiable conclusion about the structure of `Gene-Y`?\n\nA. `Gene-Y` consists of two exons and three introns. The introns are located in the gDNA at positions 1,701–4,500, 4,901–8,100, and 8,701–10,000.\n\nB. `Gene-Y` consists of three exons and two introns. The introns are located in the gDNA at positions 1,701–4,500 and 4,901–8,100.\n\nC. The alignment data is inconclusive because the 5' cap and 3' poly-A tail sequences, which are critical for defining gene boundaries, are not represented in the cDNA sequence.\n\nD. The presence of three distinct HSPs indicates that three separate but related genes (a gene family) occupy the 10,000 bp genomic region, not a single gene.\n\nE. The regions of the cDNA that lie between the HSPs (i.e., around positions 500 and 900) correspond to the introns that were spliced out.", "solution": "Fundamental principles: (i) A cDNA sequence derives from mature mRNA and therefore contains only exon-derived sequence (including any untranslated regions that are retained in the mRNA) and excludes introns, which are removed by splicing. (ii) When aligning cDNA to genomic DNA, contiguous high-similarity blocks (HSPs) correspond to exons, whereas the gaps in the genomic coordinates between successive, colinear HSPs correspond to introns. (iii) If the cDNA aligns in a consistent order along the genome (increasing cDNA coordinates mapping to increasing genomic coordinates), this supports a single, multi-exon gene rather than multiple genes.\n\nApply to the given alignments: The cDNA of length 1,500 bp aligns in three non-overlapping, colinear HSPs:\n- cDNA 1–500 maps to gDNA 1,201–1,700,\n- cDNA 501–900 maps to gDNA 4,501–4,900,\n- cDNA 901–1,500 maps to gDNA 8,101–8,700.\n\nBecause cDNA lacks introns, each HSP represents an exon. Therefore, the exons are located in the gDNA at 1,201–1,700, 4,501–4,900, and 8,101–8,700. The introns must lie between these exons in the genomic sequence, specifically in the intervals 1,701–4,500 and 4,901–8,100. The regions outside these exons, namely 1–1,200 (upstream) and 8,701–10,000 (downstream) relative to the mapped exons, are not supported by the cDNA as part of the transcript and cannot be asserted to be intronic; rather, they are flanking or intergenic sequences with respect to the mapped transcript.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because it asserts three introns and misclassifies the downstream gDNA 8,701–10,000 region as an intron despite no cDNA evidence of additional exonic sequence beyond 8,700; the data support only two introns between the three mapped exons.\n- B is correct: three exons (the three HSPs) and two introns located at 1,701–4,500 and 4,901–8,100.\n- C is incorrect: identifying exon–intron structure from cDNA-to-genome alignment does not require explicit five-prime cap or three-prime poly-A tail sequences; the exon count and intron intervals between mapped exons are inferable from the alignment alone.\n- D is incorrect: the single cDNA mapping colinearly to three genomic blocks indicates one spliced gene rather than three separate genes.\n- E is incorrect: introns are absent from cDNA; thus, regions “between HSPs” in the cDNA are simply exon junctions within the cDNA, not introns. The introns correspond to the gaps in the genomic coordinates between HSPs.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that Gene-Y consists of three exons and two introns located at 1,701–4,500 and 4,901–8,100 in the gDNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2294334"}]}
