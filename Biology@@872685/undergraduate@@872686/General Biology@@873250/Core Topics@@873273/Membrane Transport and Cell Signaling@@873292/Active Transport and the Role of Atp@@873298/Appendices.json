Under standard physiological conditions, these neurons maintain a high intracellular concentration of potassium ions ($K^{+}$) and a low intracellular concentration of sodium ions ($Na^{+}$) relative to the extracellular fluid. The biologist introduces a synthetic compound, \"Synthoblock-D,\" into the culture medium. This compound is a highly specific, non-competitive inhibitor of the F1 subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase, effectively halting the production of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation. Assuming all other cellular processes and membrane channels remain initially unaffected, what is the most likely, long-term consequence for the intracellular concentrations of these two ions as a direct result of Synthoblock-D's effect on the primary active transporter that manages their gradients?\n\nA. The intracellular concentration of $Na^{+}$ will decrease, and the intracellular concentration of $K^{+}$ will increase.\n\nB. The intracellular concentration of both $Na^{+}$ and $K^{+}$ will decrease.\n\nC. The intracellular concentrations of $Na^{+}$ and $K^{+}$ will remain largely unchanged because their transport is passive.\n\nD.

Per catalytic cycle, it hydrolyzes one ATP molecule and moves $3$ intracellular sodium ions out of the cell and $2$ extracellular potassium ions into the cell, thereby maintaining low intracellular sodium and high intracellular potassium. Symbolically, its stoichiometry can be expressed as: for each ATP hydrolyzed, $3\\,\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ are exported and $2\\,\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ are imported.\n\nMitochondrial ATP synthase produces ATP via oxidative phosphorylation using the proton-motive force; its F1 subunit catalyzes the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP.
