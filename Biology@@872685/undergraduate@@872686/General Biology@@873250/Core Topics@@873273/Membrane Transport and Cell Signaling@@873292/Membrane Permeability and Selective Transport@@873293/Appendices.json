{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Cells often need to move substances against their concentration gradients, a process that requires energy. This can be accomplished directly using ATP (primary active transport) or indirectly by harnessing the power of a pre-existing electrochemical gradient (secondary active transport). This exercise [@problem_id:2302421] provides a classic biological scenario to help you distinguish between these crucial mechanisms. By analyzing how plant cells accumulate sucrose, you will learn to identify the key features of a secondary active symporter, a widespread and vital transport strategy in nature.", "problem": "In plant cells, such as those lining the phloem, the accumulation of sucrose to high concentrations is a vital process for sugar transport throughout the organism. This process is energy-dependent. It is observed that the process relies on a proton pump, which is an ATPase that actively transports hydrogen ions ($H^{+}$) from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space, creating a steep electrochemical gradient. A separate membrane transport protein then couples the energetically favorable flow of $H^{+}$ back into the cytoplasm with the transport of sucrose molecules into the cell. This cotransport mechanism allows the cell to accumulate sucrose at a concentration much higher than that in the extracellular environment.\n\nBased on this description of the sucrose transport mechanism, which of the following provides the most accurate and specific classification for the protein that moves both sucrose and $H^{+}$?\n\nA. Primary Active Transport\n\nB. Facilitated Diffusion\n\nC. Secondary Active Transport via an Antiporter\n\nD. Secondary Active Transport via a Symporter\n\nE. Simple Diffusion", "solution": "The process described consists of two distinct membrane proteins with different energy couplings. First, a membrane $H^{+}$-ATPase uses the free energy of ATP hydrolysis to pump $H^{+}$ from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space. This establishes a transmembrane electrochemical gradient for $H^{+}$, which can be denoted as a proton motive force, comprising both a chemical component (higher $[H^{+}]$ outside) and an electrical component (outside relatively positive).\n\nSecond, a separate transporter couples the energetically favorable influx of $H^{+}$ down its electrochemical gradient to the uptake of sucrose into the cytoplasm against its concentration gradient. Because the energy source for sucrose accumulation is the preexisting $H^{+}$ electrochemical gradient rather than direct ATP hydrolysis by this transporter, the mechanism is classified as secondary active transport.\n\nTo determine the specific type, we compare directions: $H^{+}$ moves from the extracellular space into the cytoplasm, and sucrose also moves from the extracellular space into the cytoplasm. Both substrates move in the same direction across the membrane. By definition, this is a symport (cotransport in the same direction). An antiporter would exchange substrates in opposite directions, which is not the case here.\n\nTherefore:\n- Not primary active transport: the sucrose cotransporter does not hydrolyze ATP directly; the $H^{+}$-ATPase is the primary transporter.\n- Not facilitated diffusion: sucrose accumulates against its gradient, requiring energy coupling, not passive transport.\n- Not simple diffusion: sucrose is large and polar, and the process is protein-mediated.\n- Correct classification: secondary active transport via a symporter.\n\nThus, the most accurate and specific classification for the protein that moves both sucrose and $H^{+}$ is a secondary active symporter.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2302421"}, {"introduction": "The movement of molecules across a membrane is a thermodynamic process with specific energy costs or yields.
