Ligation is possible, but the newly formed junction sequence cannot be digested by either XbaI or SpeI.", "solution": "To determine the outcome of the ligation, we must first analyze the single-stranded overhangs, or \"sticky ends,\" produced by each restriction enzyme digestion.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the cut made by XbaI on the plasmid vector.\nThe recognition sequence for XbaI is 5'-TCTAGA-3'. The enzyme cuts between the first T and the first C on the top strand, and between the T and the C on the bottom strand.\nThe double-stranded sequence is:\n5'-...T C T A G A...-3'\n3'-...A G A T C T...-5'\n\nAfter digestion with XbaI, the DNA is cleaved as follows:\n5'-...T-3' and 5'-C T A G A...-3'\n3'-...A G A T C-5' and 3'-T...-5'\n\nThis creates a 4-nucleotide single-stranded overhang on the 5' end. The sequence of the overhang is 5'-CTAG-3'.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the cut made by SpeI on the gene fragment.\nThe recognition sequence for SpeI is 5'-ACTAGT-3'. The enzyme cuts between the A and the C on the top strand, and between the T and the C on the bottom strand.\nThe double-stranded sequence is:\n5'-...A C T A G T...-3'\n3'-...T G A T C A...-5'\n\nAfter digestion with SpeI, the DNA is cleaved as follows:\n5'-...A-3' and 5'-C T A G T...-3'\n3'-...T G A T C-5' and 3'-A...-5'\n\nThis also creates a 4-nucleotide single-stranded overhang on the 5' end. The sequence of this overhang is 5'-CTAG-3'.\n\nStep 3: Determine if ligation is possible.\nLigation of sticky ends requires the single-stranded overhangs to be complementary. The overhang on the XbaI-digested vector is 5'-CTAG-3'. The overhang on the SpeI-digested insert is also 5'-CTAG-3'. The complementary sequence to 5'-CTAG-3' is 3'-GATC-5'. When the vector's 5'-CTAG-3' overhang meets the insert's 5'-CTAG-3' overhang, they are not directly ligated. Instead, the overhang of one fragment (e.g., vector's 5'-CTAG-3') anneals with the complementary overhang generated at the other end of the cut site on the other fragment. Let's look at the two ends that will be joined:\n\nVector end:\n5'-...T\n3'-...A G A T C-5'\n\nInsert end:\n          5'-C T A G T...-3'\n                    A...-3'\n\nThe single-stranded overhang on the vector is 5'-CTAG-3', and its complementary strand is 3'-GATC-5'. The overhang on the insert is also 5'-CTAG-3'. These two overhangs are identical and therefore perfectly complementary to each other's template strands. They can anneal via hydrogen bonds:\n\n5'-...T       C T A G T...-3'\n3'-...A G A T C       A...-3'\n\nThe overhangs base-pair as follows: C with G, T with A, A with T, and G with C. Since the overhangs are identical (5'-CTAG-3'), they are compatible for ligation. DNA ligase can then form phosphodiester bonds to seal the nicks in the sugar-phosphate backbone. Thus, ligation is possible. This eliminates option A.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the newly formed junction sequence.\nAfter ligation, the new double-stranded sequence at the junction will be:\n5'-...T C T A G T...-3'\n3'-...A G A T C A...-5'\n\nThe sequence across the ligation junction on the top strand is 5'-TCTAGT-3'.\n\nStep 5: Determine if the new junction site is digestible by XbaI or SpeI.\nWe compare the new sequence, 5'-TCTAGT-3', to the recognition sequences of the original enzymes.\n-   XbaI recognition sequence: 5'-TCTAGA-3'. The new sequence 5'-TCTAGT-3' differs at the last base (T instead of A). Therefore, the new site cannot be digested by XbaI.\n-   SpeI recognition sequence: 5'-ACTAGT-3'. The new sequence 5'-TCTAGT-3' differs at the first base (T instead of A). Therefore, the new site cannot be digested by SpeI.\n\nConclusion: The ligation is possible, but the resulting junction site is a \"scar\" sequence that is no longer recognized by either XbaI or SpeI. This means the ligation is irreversible by restriction digestion with these two enzymes.\n\nThis corresponds to option E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2031106"}, {"introduction": "Modern synthetic biology relies on powerful techniques like Golden Gate assembly, which uses Type IIS restriction enzymes to seamlessly stitch DNA parts together. This practice challenges you to predict the outcome of an assembly when a common design flaw—an unexpected internal restriction site—is discovered. Solving this requires a deeper understanding of the iterative digestion-ligation cycle that drives these reactions and forces the accumulation of the intended final product. [@problem_id:2031120]", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is planning a Golden Gate assembly reaction to construct a simple transcriptional unit. The goal is to assemble a promoter and a Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) coding sequence into a destination vector. The assembly is a one-pot reaction containing the Type IIS restriction enzyme BsaI and T4 DNA ligase.\n\nThe three components for the assembly are:\n1.  A destination vector, `pDest`, which carries an ampicillin resistance gene. When cut with BsaI, it produces a linear backbone with the specific 4-base overhangs `5'-AGGT-3'` and `5'-TACC-3'`.\n2.  A part plasmid containing a promoter sequence. When this plasmid is cut with BsaI, the promoter fragment is released with the overhangs `5'-AGGT-3'` and `5'-GCAA-3'`.\n3.  A part plasmid containing the RFP coding sequence. This part was designed to be released by BsaI digestion with overhangs `5'-GCAA-3'` and `5'-TACC-3'`, allowing it to ligate downstream of the promoter.\n\nAfter designing the experiment, a routine sequence check reveals a critical flaw: there is an unexpected, internal BsaI recognition site within the RFP coding sequence. The DNA sequence context of this internal site is `...GGTCTCaCTAG...`. The BsaI enzyme recognizes the sequence `GGTCTC(N1/N5)`, meaning it cuts one nucleotide downstream on one strand and five nucleotides downstream on the complementary strand, creating a 4-base overhang.\n\nAssuming the one-pot assembly reaction with BsaI and T4 ligase proceeds to completion, which of the following options best describes the most abundant, high-molecular-weight DNA product you would expect to find in the reaction tube, aside from the initial unreacted plasmids?\n\nA. The correctly assembled, circular plasmid containing the destination vector, the full promoter, and the full RFP sequence.\n\nB. A circular plasmid containing the destination vector and the promoter, but lacking the RFP sequence.\n\nC. A high concentration of the original destination vector `pDest` that has been cut by BsaI and then re-ligated to reform its original circular state.\n\nD. A linear DNA molecule consisting of the `pDest` vector backbone ligated to the promoter and the 5'-proximal fragment of the RFP coding sequence.\n\nE. A mixed population of circular plasmids containing random combinations of the promoter and the two RFP fragments in various orientations.", "solution": "We consider a Golden Gate assembly using BsaI (a Type IIS restriction endonuclease) and T4 DNA ligase. The key properties needed are: (i) BsaI recognizes the sequence GGTCTC and cleaves outside the site at positions denoted N1/N5, producing a four-nucleotide 5' overhang; (ii) in a one-pot Golden Gate reaction, BsaI and ligase act iteratively so that any junctions that retain BsaI recognition sites are repeatedly re-cut, while correctly assembled junctions that remove the recognition sites persist.\n\nFrom the design, after BsaI digestion:\n- The destination vector backbone presents noncomplementary 4-base overhangs labeled AGGT and TACC (chosen to enforce directional assembly and prevent self-ligation).\n- The promoter fragment presents overhangs AGGT and GCAA.\n- The intended RFP fragment presents overhangs GCAA and TACC, so that the designed junctions are: vector–promoter at AGGT, promoter–RFP at GCAA, and RFP–vector at TACC.\n\nA sequence check reveals an internal BsaI site within the RFP: ...GGTCTC a CTAG.... Because BsaI cleaves at N1/N5 relative to GGTCTC, the internal cleavage generates a four-nucleotide overhang corresponding to the four bases following the first downstream nucleotide, namely CTAG. Therefore, the single intended RFP fragment is split into two fragments:\n- The 5'-proximal RFP fragment with left overhang GCAA (as designed) and right overhang CTAG (from the internal BsaI cut).\n- The 3'-proximal RFP fragment with left overhang CTAG (from the internal cut) and right overhang TACC (as designed).\n\nWe now analyze what ligations are compatible:\n- Vector AGGT can ligate to promoter AGGT (by design).\n- Promoter GCAA can ligate to the 5'-RFP GCAA (by design).\n- The 3'-RFP TACC can ligate to vector TACC (by design).\n- The two RFP halves could in principle ligate to each other at CTAG, because CTAG is palindromic (its reverse complement is itself), so the overhangs are complementary.\n\nHowever, the internal BsaI recognition site GGTCTC resides upstream of the CTAG overhang on both RFP halves. In a Golden Gate reaction, any ligation across CTAG between the two halves recreates a contiguous RFP segment that still contains the internal GGTCTC site, which BsaI will recognize and cut again at N1/N5, regenerating the CTAG overhangs. Thus, any circular plasmid that includes the full-length RFP (whether correctly assembled or otherwise) will be continuously recut at the internal site and will not accumulate. This rules out option A.\n\nNext, consider whether the vector can circularize without RFP or with only the promoter. For option B (vector plus promoter only), the promoter right overhang is GCAA, which is not complementary to the vector right overhang TACC; therefore, the vector cannot be closed by ligating only the promoter. For option C (vector self-religation), the vector ends AGGT and TACC are deliberately designed to be noncomplementary, preventing recircularization of the backbone. Therefore, B and C are disfavored by overhang incompatibility.\n\nOption E suggests a mixed population of circles with random orientations. Because the only overhangs present are AGGT, GCAA, CTAG, and TACC, and because only matching complementary pairs ligate efficiently, the only potential extra ligation besides the designed ones is the CTAG–CTAG ligation between the two RFP halves. As explained, any product that includes the internal GGTCTC site will be repeatedly recut, preventing accumulation of stable circular products. Random circular plasmids are therefore not expected to be abundant.\n\nThe remaining plausible product is a linear assembly that uses only the compatible designed junctions that do not reintroduce internal BsaI sites at those junctions. Specifically, vector AGGT ligates to promoter AGGT, and promoter GCAA ligates to the 5'-RFP GCAA, generating a linear molecule that terminates at the internal BsaI cut with a CTAG overhang on the RFP side and at the vector right end with a TACC overhang. There is no compatible partner to close either end into a circle, and the formed junctions (vector–promoter and promoter–RFP5') lack BsaI sites and thus persist. The internal site remains at the free RFP end, which is already cut and cannot progress to a stable circular product under continued digestion-ligation cycling. This linear construct is high molecular weight (vector plus promoter plus the 5'-portion of RFP) and is the expected dominant product aside from unreacted plasmids.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2031120"}]}
