To order this gene from a synthesis service, the researcher must provide the corresponding DNA sequence in the correct format. The DNA sequence must include a start codon and a stop codon to ensure proper expression in a bacterial system.\n\nUsing the provided standard codon table, determine the correct DNA sequence, formatted for submission. The submission format is the FASTA format, which consists of a single-line description, called the header, followed by lines of sequence data. The header line is distinguished from the sequence data by a greater-than (\">\") symbol in the first position.

The budget for the synthesis of the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is capped at $B = \\$1000$. The construct must contain several essential components with fixed lengths, and one component of variable length. The components are:\n*   A promoter sequence of length $L_P = 55$ base pairs (bp).\n*   A Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) of length $L_{RBS} = 20$ bp.\n*   The Coding Sequence (CDS) for the novel protein, which consists of $N_{aa} = 300$ amino acids. Each amino acid is encoded by 3 base pairs.\n*   A C-terminal 6x-His tag for purification, which consists of 6 amino acids.\n*   A flexible peptide linker of unknown integer length $L_{linker}$ (in bp) that connects the protein to the His-tag. The researcher wants to make this linker as long as possible.\n*   A transcriptional terminator sequence of length $L_T = 75$ bp.\n\nThe researcher has received quotes from two gene synthesis companies:\n\n*   **Company A (SynthFast):** Charges a one-time setup fee of $F_A = \\$80$ and a synthesis cost of $C_A = \\$0.75$ per base pair.\n*   **Company B (GenoMax):** Charges no setup fee, but has a standard synthesis cost of $C_B = \\$0.85$ per base pair.
