This practice explores a more realistic scenario by investigating how breaking this symmetry affects the circuit's behavior. By analyzing the consequences of altering the degradation rate of one protein, you will gain crucial insights into how the size and position of the hysteretic loop can be tuned, a key consideration for designing robust and predictable genetic switches [@problem_id:2042964].", "problem": "A synthetic biologist is designing a genetic toggle switch, a fundamental circuit in which two genes mutually repress each other's expression. Let the concentrations of the two repressor proteins be denoted by $a$ and $b$. The dynamics of this system are modeled by the following coupled ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$\n\\frac{da}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + b^n} - \\delta a\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{db}{dt} = \\frac{u \\cdot \\alpha}{1 + a^n} - \\delta_b b\n$$\n\nHere, $\\alpha$ is the maximal synthesis rate, $n > 1$ is the Hill coefficient describing the cooperativity of repression, and $\\delta$ is the degradation rate for protein A. The system is designed to be symmetric, so the repression thresholds and Hill coefficients are identical for both genes.\n\nAn external, membrane-permeable small molecule, called an inducer, is used to control the switch. Its concentration, $u$, is an externally-controlled dimensionless parameter that linearly scales the maximal synthesis rate of protein B.\n\nInitially, the degradation rate for protein B is the same as for protein A, i.e., $\\delta_b = \\delta$. In this symmetric configuration, the system exhibits hysteresis: when plotting the steady-state concentration of protein A as a function of the inducer concentration $u$, there is a region of bistability forming a characteristic loop.\n\nA mutation is introduced into the gene encoding for protein B, which adds a tag that targets it for rapid proteasomal degradation. This significantly increases its degradation rate, so that the new rate $\\delta_b'$ is much larger than the original rate $\\delta$ (i.e., $\\delta_b' \\gg \\delta$). All other parameters ($\\alpha$, $n$, $\\delta$) remain unchanged.\n\nHow does this modification qualitatively change the hysteretic loop (the plot of steady-state protein A concentration versus inducer concentration $u$)?\n\nA.

In particular, the bistability (hysteresis) region is an interval in $\\gamma$, say $\\gamma\\in[\\gamma_{-},\\gamma_{+}]$, determined by the simultaneous conditions $a=F(a;\\gamma)$ and $\\frac{d}{da}F(a;\\gamma)=1$ for the scalar fixed-point map\n$$\na=F(a;\\gamma)=\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{1+a^{n}}\\right)^{n}}.\n$$\nBecause $\\beta=\\alpha/\\delta$ and $n$ are unchanged by the mutation, the interval $[\\gamma_{-},\\gamma_{+}]$ is unchanged.\n\nOriginally, in the symmetric case $\\delta_{b}=\\delta$, one has $\\gamma=(u\\,\\alpha)/\\delta$, so the corresponding bistable interval in $u$ is $[u_{-}^{(0)},u_{+}^{(0)}]$ with\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\pm}=\\frac{u_{\\pm}^{(0)}\\,\\alpha}{\\delta}.\n$$\nAfter the mutation, $\\delta_{b}$ is replaced by $\\delta_{b}'\\gg\\delta$, so for the same $\\gamma$ we must have\n$$\n\\gamma=\\frac{u'\\,\\alpha}{\\delta_{b}'} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad u'=\\frac{\\delta_{b}'}{\\alpha}\\,\\gamma.\n$$\nTherefore, the new bistable interval in $u$ is\n$$\nu_{\\pm}'=\\frac{\\delta_{b}'}{\\alpha}\\,\\gamma_{\\pm}=\\frac{\\delta_{b}'}{\\alpha}\\,\\frac{u_{\\pm}^{(0)}\\,\\alpha}{\\delta}=\\frac{\\delta_{b}'}{\\delta}\\,u_{\\pm}^{(0)}.\n$$\nSince $\\delta_{b}'/\\delta>1$, both switching points move to higher $u$ by the same multiplicative factor, and the width in $u$,\n$$\nu_{+}'-u_{-}'=\\frac{\\delta_{b}'}{\\delta}\\,\\bigl(u_{+}^{(0)}-u_{-}^{(0)}\\bigr),\n$$\nincreases by the same factor. Thus, the hysteretic loop in the plot of steady-state $a$ versus $u$ shifts to higher inducer concentrations and becomes wider.

The circuit consists of three genes, `genA`, `genB`, and `genC`, which produce protein products A, B, and C, respectively. The regulatory interactions are as follows:\n- Each protein (A, B, or C) acts as a transcriptional activator for its own gene, creating a positive feedback loop.\n- Each protein acts as a transcriptional repressor for the other two genes. For example, protein A represses the transcription of `genB` and `genC`.\n\nThis \"winner-take-all\" architecture results in three mutually exclusive, stable steady states:\n- **State A**: High concentration of protein A, low concentrations of B and C.\n- **State B**: High concentration of protein B, low concentrations of A and C.\n- **State C**: High concentration of protein C, low concentrations of A and B.\n\nThe behavior of the circuit can be controlled by two external, membrane-permeable small molecules, inducer $I_A$ and inducer $I_B$.\n- Inducer $I_A$ strongly activates the transcription of `genA`.\n- Inducer $I_B$ strongly activates the transcription of `genB`.\n\nAn experiment is conducted on a population of these bacteria. The population is initially prepared such that all cells are in State C. This time is denoted as $t_0$. The following protocol is then executed:\n1.

A standard coarse-grained description uses Hill-type production with auto-activation and cross-repression.

For sufficiently strong auto-activation and cross-repression, the system exhibits three mutually exclusive stable steady states (winner-take-all): A-dominant $(a\\gg b,c)$, B-dominant $(b\\gg a,c)$, and C-dominant $(c\\gg a,b)$.\n\nAt each step $t_{k}$, the state $S_{k}$ is the asymptotically stable fixed point selected by the inputs $(I_{A},I_{B})$ from the previous state’s basin of attraction.\n\nInitial condition: at $t_{0}$, the system is prepared in State C, i.e., $c$ is high and $a,b$ are low.\n\nStep at $t_{1}$ (add $I_{A}$): Turning on $I_{A}$ raises $\\beta_{A}(I_{A})$. The $\\dot a=0$ nullcline shifts upward so that, despite repression by $c$, production of $a$ exceeds $\\gamma_{A}a$ once $a$ grows past the activation threshold $K_{AA}$. As $a$ increases, it auto-activates and represses $b$ and $c$ via the factors $\\frac{K_{AB}^{m}}{K_{AB}^{m}+a^{m}}$ and $\\frac{K_{AC}^{m}}{K_{AC}^{m}+a^{m}}$, driving $b,c$ down. The only stable steady state consistent with strong $I_{A}$ in a winner-take-all circuit is A-dominant. Therefore, after equilibration, $S_{1}=\\text{A}$.\n\nStep at $t_{2}$ (add $I_{B}$, keep $I_{A}$): Now both $\\beta_{A}(I_{A})$ and $\\beta_{B}(I_{B})$ are large. The potential stable steady states under these inputs are A-dominant and B-dominant; C-dominant is disfavored because $c$ receives no external activation and is repressed by both A and B. The system is currently at A-dominant with $a$ high and $b$ repressed. In the $db/dt$ equation, the repression factor $\\frac{K_{AB}^{m}}{K_{AB}^{m}+a^{m}}$ remains small while $a$ is high, preventing $b$ from rising despite the increase in $\\beta_{B}(I_{B})$. Positive feedback on A plus its head start keeps the trajectory inside the basin of the A-dominant fixed point. Thus, after equilibration, $S_{2}=\\text{A}$.\n\nStep at $t_{3}$ (remove $I_{A}$, keep $I_{B}$): Removing $I_{A}$ reduces $\\beta_{A}(I_{A})$ back to baseline, shifting the $\\dot a=0$ nullcline downward so that the A-dominant fixed point loses stability under continued repression by rising $b$. Meanwhile, $\\beta_{B}(I_{B})$ remains high, so any relief of A-mediated repression allows $b$ to increase via its auto-activation. As $b$ rises it further represses $a$ through the factor $\\frac{K_{BA}^{m}}{K_{BA}^{m}+b^{m}}$ in $\\dot a$, tipping the system into the B-dominant winner-take-all state. Therefore, after equilibration, $S_{3}=\\text{B}$.\n\nStep at $t_{4}$ (remove $I_{B}$): With both inducers absent, the circuit reverts to its intrinsic tristability. Starting from the B-dominant fixed point with strong self-activation, the system remains in that basin because no input perturbs it across a separatrix to A- or C-dominant states. Hence, after equilibration, $S_{4}=\\text{B}$.\n\nCollecting the states, the sequence is $(S_{1},S_{2},S_{3},S_{4})=(\\text{A},\\text{A},\\text{B},\\text{B})$, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2042962"}, {"introduction": "A fundamental question in designing genetic switches is determining the precise parameter conditions required for bistability to even be possible.
