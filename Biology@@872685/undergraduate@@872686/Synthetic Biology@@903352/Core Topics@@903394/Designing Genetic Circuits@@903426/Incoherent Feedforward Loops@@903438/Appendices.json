Consider a synthetic gene circuit constructed in a bacterium, based on the Type 1 Incoherent Feedforward Loop (I1-FFL) architecture. The circuit consists of three genes, which code for proteins $X$, $Y$, and $Z$.\n\nThe system is designed with the following interactions:\n1.  The gene for protein $X$ is expressed constitutively, meaning the cell always contains a stable concentration of protein $X$. However, protein $X$ is an activator that is only functional when bound to a specific small molecule, inducer $I$. Let us denote the active form as $X^*$.\n2.  The active activator, $X^*$, binds to the promoter regions of both gene $Y$ and gene $Z$, thereby activating their transcription.\n3.  Protein $Z$ functions as a repressor. It binds to an operator site on the promoter for gene $Y$, preventing its transcription.\n\nAssume the system is initially at a steady state in a medium with no inducer $I$. At time $t=0$, the inducer $I$ is introduced into the medium and maintained at a high, constant concentration, causing all available protein $X$ to become active ($X^*$) almost instantaneously. Assume that the transcription and translation processes for both $Y$ and $Z$ have characteristic time delays, and that protein degradation occurs for all proteins.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the concentration of the output protein $Y$ as a function of time for $t > 0$?\n\nA. The concentration of $Y$ remains near zero.\n\nB. The concentration of $Y$ rises to a high steady-state level and remains there.\n\nC.

[@problem_id:2043174]", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment, a researcher designs a genetic circuit based on the Type 1 Incoherent Feedforward Loop (IFFL). The circuit is intended to have the following regulatory logic:\n1. An external inducer molecule, $S_x$, when added, binds to and activates a transcription factor, $X$.\n2. The active form of protein $X$ acts as an activator for the transcription of two genes, one encoding an output protein, $Y$, and the other encoding a repressor protein, $Z$.\n3. The repressor protein, $Z$, binds to the promoter region of the gene for $Y$, thereby inhibiting its transcription.\n\nThe intended behavior is for protein $X$ to activate both $Y$ and $Z$, and for $Z$, in turn, to repress $Y$.\n\nDuring the construction of the bacterial strain containing this circuit, a critical error occurs: the entire gene encoding the repressor protein $Z$ is accidentally deleted from the genome. The rest of the circuit, involving $S_x$, $X$, and $Y$, remains perfectly intact.\n\nAn experiment is then conducted where the engineered bacteria are grown in a stable medium. At time $t=0$, the inducer $S_x$ is added to the medium and maintained at a constant, saturating concentration. Let $[Y](t)$ be the concentration of the output protein $Y$ at time $t$.

This path has a certain time delay associated with transcription and translation of $Y$.\n    -   **Indirect pathway (repression):** $X$ promotes the production of a repressor $Z$. Once $Z$ is produced, it inhibits the production of $Y$. This path has a longer time delay because it involves the transcription and translation of $Z$ *before* $Z$ can act on the gene for $Y$.\n    The combined effect is that upon activation of $X$, the direct activation pathway turns on first, causing $[Y]$ to rise. Later, as the repressor $Z$ accumulates, it begins to shut down the production of $Y$, causing $[Y]$ to level off and decrease. This typically results in a pulse-like response where $[Y]$ peaks and then settles to a lower steady state. This behavior is described in option A.\n\n2.  **Analyze the modified circuit.**\n    In the scenario described, the gene for the repressor protein $Z$ is completely deleted. This means that protein $Z$ can never be produced. Consequently, the indirect repressive pathway ($X \\rightarrow Z \\dashv Y$) is broken and has no effect on the circuit's output.\n\n3.  **Determine the dynamics of the remaining circuit.**\n    With the repressive pathway removed, the only functional part of the circuit is the direct activation pathway. The logic is as follows:\n    -   The inducer $S_x$ is added at $t=0$, activating protein $X$.\n    -   The active protein $X$ binds to the promoter of gene $Y$ and activates its transcription.\n    -   This leads to the production of protein $Y$, so its concentration, $[Y](t)$, begins to increase.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the long-term behavior.**\n    Since there is no repressor $Z$ to eventually shut down the production of $Y$, the production of $Y$ will continue as long as active $X$ is present (which is true for all $t  0$ as $S_x$ is maintained). The concentration of any protein in a cell is a balance between its production rate and its degradation/dilution rate. Assuming a constant degradation/dilution rate for $Y$, the system will behave as a simple activated gene. The concentration $[Y](t)$ will increase from its initial basal level and will eventually reach a new steady state where the rate of production is balanced by the rate of degradation/dilution. This behavior corresponds to a monotonic increase that saturates at a high level, which is mathematically described by a sigmoidal or simple exponential saturation curve.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    -   **A:** Describes the pulse-generating behavior of a fully functional Type 1 IFFL. This is incorrect because the repressive arm is broken.\n    -   **B:** Describes a monotonic increase to a new, high steady state. This perfectly matches our analysis of a simple activation circuit, which is what the broken IFFL has become.\n    -   **C:** Suggests no response. This is incorrect because $X$ is an activator of $Y$, so adding $S_x$ must cause a response.\n    -   **D:** Describes oscillation. Simple feedforward loops do not generate sustained oscillations. Oscillations typically require negative feedback loops with sufficient time delay.\n    -   **E:** Describes perfect adaptation, where the output returns to the pre-stimulus level. While some IFFLs can approximate this, it still relies on the repressive arm to bring the signal down. In the absence of the repressor, there is no mechanism to return the output to its original baseline.\n\nTherefore, the correct description of the dynamics is a simple saturation curve, where the concentration of Y increases to a new, high steady state.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2043174"}, {"introduction": "Beyond understanding their natural behavior, synthetic biologists aim to engineer network motifs to perform specific tasks.
