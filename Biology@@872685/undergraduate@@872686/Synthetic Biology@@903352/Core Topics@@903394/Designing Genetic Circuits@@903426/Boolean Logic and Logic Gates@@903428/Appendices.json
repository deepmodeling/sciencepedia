The circuit's output is the fluorescence level of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which can be either \"High\" (strong fluorescence) or \"Low\" (negligible fluorescence). The circuit's behavior is controlled by two chemical inputs: Inducer A and Inducer B.\n\nThe mechanism of the circuit is as follows:\n1.  The circuit contains two genes encoding for two separate polypeptide fragments of an enzyme: the N-terminal fragment (N-frag) and the C-terminal fragment (C-frag).\n2.  The expression of the N-frag gene is activated only in the presence of Inducer A.\n3.  The expression of the C-frag gene is activated only in the presence of Inducer B.\n4.  A functional enzyme is formed only when *both* the N-frag and C-frag are present and assemble together.\n5.  This functional enzyme acts as a specific transcriptional activator for a promoter, P_rep.\n6.  The P_rep promoter drives the expression of a repressor protein, R_gfp.\n7.  The gene for GFP is controlled by a promoter, P_gfp, which is constitutively active (always \"ON\") unless the repressor R_gfp is present to bind to it and turn it \"OFF\".\n\nA bacterial culture containing this genetic circuit is grown in a medium that contains Inducer A but lacks Inducer B. Based on the described mechanism, predict the resulting state of GFP fluorescence.\n\nA. High, because the P_gfp promoter is not repressed.\n\nB. Low, because the R_gfp repressor is produced.\n\nC. Low, because the N-frag directly represses the P_gfp promoter.\n\nD. High, because Inducer A directly activates the P_gfp promoter.\n\nE. The fluorescence level cannot be determined without knowing the concentration of Inducer A.", "solution": "Let the presence of Inducer A and Inducer B be binary inputs $A,B \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where $1$ denotes presence and $0$ denotes absence. Let $E$ denote the presence of the functional enzyme, $P_{\\text{rep}}$ the activation state of the promoter driving the repressor, $R$ the presence of the repressor $R_{\\text{gfp}}$, and $G$ the GFP output, where $G=1$ means high fluorescence and $G=0$ means low fluorescence.\n\nBy the circuit design:\n1. The functional enzyme forms only when both fragments are present, so $E = A \\land B$.\n2. The functional enzyme activates $P_{\\text{rep}}$, so $P_{\\text{rep}} = E$.\n3. The repressor $R_{\\text{gfp}}$ is produced from $P_{\\text{rep}}$, so $R = P_{\\text{rep}}$.\n4. GFP is constitutively expressed unless repressed by $R_{\\text{gfp}}$, hence $G = \\neg R$.\nCombining these relations gives $G = \\neg R = \\neg P_{\\text{rep}} = \\neg E = \\neg(A \\land B)$.\nEquivalently, by De Morgan’s law, $G = \\neg A \\lor \\neg B$.\n\nIn the given condition, Inducer A is present and Inducer B is absent, so $A=1$ and $B=0$. Therefore, $E = A \\land B = 1 \\land 0 = 0$, $P_{\\text{rep}}=0$, $R=0$, and $G=\\neg 0=1$.\nThus GFP fluorescence is high because the constitutive promoter $P_{\\text{gfp}}$ is not repressed in the absence of $R_{\\text{gfp}}$. This corresponds to option A. The other options are inconsistent with the mechanism: there is no repressor produced without the functional enzyme (reject B), N-frag does not directly repress $P_{\\text{gfp}}$ (reject C), Inducer A does not directly activate $P_{\\text{gfp}}$ (reject D), and the qualitative logic does not require concentration information to determine the state (reject E).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2023924"}, {"introduction": "While we often describe genetic circuits using binary logic (ON/OFF), their real behavior is analog and depends on molecular concentrations.
