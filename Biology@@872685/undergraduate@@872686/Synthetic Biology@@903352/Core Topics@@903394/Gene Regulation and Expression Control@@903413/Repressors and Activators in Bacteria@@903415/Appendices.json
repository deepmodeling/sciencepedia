The goal is to have the bacterium express `geneA` at low concentrations of an inducer molecule, `L`, and express `geneB` only when the concentration of `L` becomes high.\n\nThe system is designed as follows: Both `geneA` and `geneB` are regulated by the exact same transcriptional activator protein, let's call it `ActP`. The `ActP` protein is constitutively expressed in an inactive state. It becomes active only upon binding to the inducer molecule `L`. The concentration of active `ActP` is therefore directly proportional to the concentration of `L`.\n\nThe biologist can design the promoter region upstream of `geneA` and `geneB` by choosing the number and sequence of the operator sites where the active `ActP` binds to initiate transcription.

A reporter gene, encoding Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), is regulated by a promoter that contains a single operator site, $O_g$. The expression of GFP is controlled by a repressor protein, $R$, which is constitutively produced at a total intracellular concentration of $R_{tot}$. When a molecule of $R$ binds to $O_g$, transcription of GFP is completely silenced.\n\nThe activity of the repressor $R$ is modulated by an inducer molecule, $L$. The inducer binds to the repressor in a cooperative manner, described by the reaction $R + nL \\rightleftharpoons RL_n$, where $n$ is the Hill coefficient. The complex $RL_n$ is inactive and cannot bind to any operator site. The dissociation constant for the repressor-inducer interaction is $K_L = \\frac{[R][L]^n}{[RL_n]}$, where $[X]$ denotes the concentration of species $X$.\n\nThe repressor binds to any single operator site ($O$) with a dissociation constant $K_d = \\frac{[R][O]}{[RO]}$.\n\nTo study the system's dynamics, a second plasmid is introduced into the bacterium. This plasmid carries a large number of \"decoy\" operator sites, $O_d$, which are identical in sequence to $O_g$. These decoy sites bind the repressor $R$ with the same affinity but do not regulate any genes. The total concentration of these decoy sites in the cell is $O_{d,tot}$.\n\nWe can make the following assumptions:\n1. The expression level of GFP is directly proportional to the probability that the operator site $O_g$ is unbound.\n2. The concentration of repressor molecules bound to the single gene-regulating operator site $O_g$ is negligible in the cell's overall budget of repressor molecules.\n\nYour task is to determine how these decoy sites affect the sensitivity of the gene circuit to the inducer. Specifically, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the ratio $\\frac{K_{eff, \\text{with decoys}}}{K_{eff, \\text{without decoys}}}$.

The probability that the operator is free can be expressed using a partition function over the states of the operator (free or bound):\n$$P(\\text{free}) = \\frac{\\text{statistical weight of free state}}{\\text{statistical weight of free state} + \\text{statistical weight of bound state}}$$\nThe statistical weight of the free state is 1. The statistical weight of the bound state is proportional to the concentration of free, active repressor, $[R]$, and inversely proportional to the dissociation constant, $K_d$.

We will use this condition to find the required inducer concentration, $K_{eff}$, in both scenarios.\n\n**Step 2: System without Decoy Sites**\n\nFirst, let's find $K_{eff, \\text{without decoys}}$. In this case, the total concentration of repressor, $R_{tot}$, is distributed between three forms: free active repressor ($[R]$), inducer-bound repressor ($[RL_n]$), and operator-bound repressor ($[RO_g]$).\n$$R_{tot} = [R] + [RL_n] + [RO_g]$$\nBased on assumption 2, the amount of repressor bound to the single genomic operator is negligible compared to the total, so $[RO_g] \\approx 0$.\n$$R_{tot} \\approx [R] + [RL_n]$$\nFrom the definition of the inducer binding equilibrium, we have $[RL_n] = \\frac{[R][L]^n}{K_L}$.\n$$R_{tot} = [R] + \\frac{[R][L]^n}{K_L} = [R]\\left(1 + \\frac{[L]^n}{K_L}\\right)$$\nTo find $K_{eff, \\text{without decoys}}$, we set $[R] = K_d$ and $[L] = K_{eff, \\text{without decoys}}$.\n$$R_{tot} = K_d\\left(1 + \\frac{(K_{eff, \\text{without decoys}})^n}{K_L}\\right)$$\nNow, we solve for $(K_{eff, \\text{without decoys}})^n$:\n$$\\frac{R_{tot}}{K_d} = 1 + \\frac{(K_{eff, \\text{without decoys}})^n}{K_L}$$\n$$\\frac{(K_{eff, \\text{without decoys}})^n}{K_L} = \\frac{R_{tot}}{K_d} - 1$$\n$$(K_{eff, \\text{without decoys}})^n = K_L \\left(\\frac{R_{tot}}{K_d} - 1\\right)$$\n\n**Step 3: System with Decoy Sites**\n\nNow we consider the system with decoy operator sites at a total concentration $O_{d,tot}$. The repressor budget must now also account for repressors bound to these decoy sites, $[RO_d]$.\n$$R_{tot} = [R] + [RL_n] + [RO_g] + [RO_d]$$\nAgain, we neglect $[RO_g]$.\n$$R_{tot} \\approx [R] + [RL_n] + [RO_d]$$\nThe concentration of repressor bound to decoy sites, $[RO_d]$, can be found from the binding equilibrium.
