The system uses a synthetic \"writer\" enzyme, a histone acetyltransferase (HAT), which is physically tethered to a specific gene's promoter region. This targeting maintains a constant effective concentration of the writer enzyme at the locus, denoted by $C_W$. This writer enzyme adds an acetylation mark to histones.\n\nThe cell naturally contains a globally distributed \"eraser\" enzyme, a histone deacetylase (HDAC), which removes the same acetylation mark. The concentration of this active eraser enzyme is uniform and constant throughout the nucleus, given by $C_E$.\n\nWe can model the kinetics of this system at the target promoter. The rate of histone acetylation (the \"writing\" reaction) is proportional to the fraction of non-acetylated histones, $f_U$, and is given by the expression $k_W C_W f_U$. Here, $k_W$ is the catalytic rate constant for the writer enzyme. Similarly, the rate of histone deacetylation (the \"erasing\" reaction) is proportional to the fraction of acetylated histones, $f_A$, and is given by $k_E C_E f_A$, where $k_E$ is the catalytic rate constant for the eraser enzyme.
