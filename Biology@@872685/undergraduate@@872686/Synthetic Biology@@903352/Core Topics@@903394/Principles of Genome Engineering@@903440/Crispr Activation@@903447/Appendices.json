This system consists of a catalytically deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) protein fused to a transcriptional activation domain, which is directed to the promoter region of the `NEUROG2` gene by a specific guide RNA (gRNA).\n\nTo quantify the effectiveness of the CRISPRa system, the researcher performs an experiment with two conditions:\n1.  **Control Group**: Stem cells are treated with the dCas9-activator and a non-targeting gRNA that does not bind to the human genome.\n2.  **Experimental Group**: Stem cells are treated with the dCas9-activator and a gRNA specifically designed to target the promoter of the `NEUROG2` gene.\n\nAfter 48 hours, messenger RNA (mRNA) was extracted from both groups, and gene expression levels were measured using Reverse Transcription Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR).

By analyzing the results from a series of systematic diagnostic tests, you will learn to logically deduce the root cause of the problem, distinguishing between issues like poor protein expression, faulty guide RNA, or inaccessible chromatin.", "problem": "A synthetic biology research team is attempting to use a Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) activation (CRISPRa) system to upregulate a silent endogenous gene, `GENE-T`, in a human cell line. The system consists of two plasmids co-transfected into the cells: one expressing a nuclease-dead Cas9 (dCas9) protein fused to a potent tripartite transcriptional activator domain called VPR (VP64-p65-Rta), and another expressing a single guide RNA (`sgRNA-T`) designed to target the promoter region of `GENE-T`.\n\nAfter 48 hours, the researchers measure the mRNA levels of `GENE-T` using Reverse Transcription-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) but observe no statistically significant increase compared to control cells that did not receive the `sgRNA-T` plasmid. To diagnose the problem, they perform a series of follow-up experiments:\n\n1.  **Activator Expression Check:** A Western blot is performed on lysates from the transfected cells using an antibody that recognizes the VPR domain. The result shows a distinct band at the correct molecular weight for the dCas9-VPR fusion protein, with an intensity comparable to a positive control sample known to work.\n\n2.  **System Functionality Control:** The team co-transfects cells with the same dCas9-VPR plasmid and a different sgRNA plasmid, `sgRNA-P`, which targets the promoter of `GENE-P`. `GENE-P` is a housekeeping gene known to reside in a region of open, accessible chromatin. This experiment results in a significant, 50-fold increase in `GENE-P` mRNA levels.\n\n3.  **Guide RNA Intrinsic Efficacy Test:** An *in vitro* binding assay is conducted. Purified dCas9-VPR protein is mixed with `sgRNA-T` and a short, synthetic, double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide containing the exact target sequence for `sgRNA-T` from the `GENE-T` promoter. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), they observe that the dCas9-VPR/sgRNA-T complex efficiently binds to the DNA oligonucleotide target, with a binding affinity in the low nanomolar range, which is considered highly effective.\n\nBased on the results of these three experiments, what is the most likely reason for the failure to activate `GENE-T` in the initial experiment?\n\nA. The dCas9-VPR activator protein was not successfully expressed in the cells.\n\nB. The `sgRNA-T` molecule is intrinsically unable to form a functional complex with the dCas9-VPR protein or to recognize its DNA target sequence.\n\nC. The chromatin structure at the `GENE-T` promoter is in a condensed, inaccessible state, preventing the CRISPRa complex from binding to its target site *in vivo*.\n\nD. The VPR activator domain of the dCas9-VPR fusion protein is non-functional and incapable of recruiting the transcription machinery.", "solution": "We evaluate each hypothesis against the provided experimental evidence using logical elimination.\n\nFirst, consider option A. The Western blot using an anti-VPR antibody shows a distinct band at the correct molecular weight for the dCas9-VPR fusion, with intensity comparable to a known positive control. This directly supports successful expression of the dCas9-VPR protein in cells, arguing against a failure of expression. Therefore, A is not consistent with the data.\n\nNext, consider option D. The system functionality control shows that co-transfection with the same dCas9-VPR plasmid and an alternative sgRNA, sgRNA-P, targeting an open-chromatin housekeeping gene promoter, yields a substantial activation (a 50-fold increase in mRNA). This demonstrates that the VPR activator domain is functional for recruiting transcriptional machinery in vivo and that the cellular context supports CRISPRa activity when targeting accessible loci. Therefore, D is not supported.\n\nThen, consider option B. The in vitro EMSA shows that the dCas9-VPR/sgRNA-T complex binds its exact DNA target with high affinity in the low nanomolar range, indicating that sgRNA-T is capable of forming a functional ribonucleoprotein complex and recognizing its target sequence. This rules out an intrinsic defect in sgRNA-T’s ability to bind dCas9 or its target DNA. Therefore, B is not supported.\n\nHaving excluded A, B, and D by direct evidence, the remaining explanation is that the CRISPRa complex cannot productively bind the target site in cells due to chromatin context. The lack of activation for GENE-T despite proper expression and functionality of dCas9-VPR and intrinsic competence of sgRNA-T is most consistent with inaccessible, condensed chromatin at the GENE-T promoter that prevents in vivo binding. This matches option C.\n\nTherefore, the most likely reason is that the chromatin at the GENE-T promoter is condensed and inaccessible, preventing CRISPRa binding and activation in vivo.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2028413"}]}
