This practice introduces a mathematical model that accounts for this leakiness and guides you through deriving the sensor's dynamic range, a key metric comparing the maximum signal to this background noise. Understanding this ratio is a foundational step in characterizing any sensor's performance. [@problem_id:2025043]", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists is designing a cell-free biosensor to detect a specific small molecule, which we will call the analyte. The sensor operates via a simple genetic circuit: an engineered Transcription Factor (TF) is designed to bind to the analyte. Upon binding, the TF-analyte complex activates a promoter, which in turn drives the expression of a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter. The fluorescence intensity directly correlates with the amount of GFP produced.\n\nAfter initial assembly, the team observes a significant level of background fluorescence, indicating that the promoter is \"leaky\" and allows for some GFP expression even in the complete absence of the analyte. To quantify the system's behavior, they propose a model for the rate of GFP production, $V$, as a function of the analyte concentration, $[A]$:\n\n$$V([A]) = V_{leak} + V_{act} \\frac{[A]}{K_D + [A]}$$\n\nHere, $V_{leak}$ is the constant basal expression rate due to promoter leakiness, $V_{act}$ is the maximum additional expression rate achieved upon full activation by the TF-analyte complex, and $K_D$ is the dissociation constant for the binding between the analyte and the TF.\n\nThe team performs two experiments to characterize the system. First, they measure the rate of GFP production with no analyte present ($[A]=0$) and find it to be $V_0$. Second, they measure the rate at an analyte concentration equal to the dissociation constant ($[A]=K_D$) and find it to be $V_1$.\n\nOne of the most important metrics for a biosensor is its dynamic range, defined as the ratio of its maximum possible signal to its minimum background signal. Based on the provided model and experimental measurements, derive an expression for the dynamic range of this biosensor in terms of $V_0$ and $V_1$.", "solution": "The goal is to determine the dynamic range of the biosensor, which is defined as the ratio of the maximum possible signal rate ($V_{max}$) to the minimum background signal rate ($V_{min}$). We are given the model for the rate of GFP production, $V([A])$, as:\n$$V([A]) = V_{leak} + V_{act} \\frac{[A]}{K_D + [A]}$$\n\nFirst, let's identify the minimum signal rate, $V_{min}$. This occurs when there is no analyte present, i.e., at $[A] = 0$.\nSubstituting $[A] = 0$ into the model equation:\n$$V_{min} = V(0) = V_{leak} + V_{act} \\frac{0}{K_D + 0} = V_{leak} + 0$$\n$$V_{min} = V_{leak}$$\nThe problem states that the experimentally measured rate at $[A]=0$ is $V_0$. Therefore, we have our first relationship:\n$$V_{min} = V_{leak} = V_0$$\n\nNext, let's identify the maximum signal rate, $V_{max}$. This occurs at a saturating concentration of the analyte, i.e., when $[A] \\to \\infty$.

We already know $V_{leak} = V_0$, so we need to find an expression for $V_{act}$. We can use the second experimental data point, where the rate was measured as $V_1$ at an analyte concentration of $[A] = K_D$.\nSubstituting $[A] = K_D$ into the model equation:\n$$V_1 = V(K_D) = V_{leak} + V_{act} \\frac{K_D}{K_D + K_D} = V_{leak} + V_{act} \\frac{K_D}{2K_D}$$\n$$V_1 = V_{leak} + \\frac{1}{2} V_{act}$$\nWe now have a system of two equations relating the model parameters to the measurements:\n1. $V_0 = V_{leak}$\n2. $V_1 = V_{leak} + \\frac{1}{2} V_{act}$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$$V_1 = V_0 + \\frac{1}{2} V_{act}$$\nNow, we can solve for $V_{act}$ in terms of $V_0$ and $V_1$:\n$$V_1 - V_0 = \\frac{1}{2} V_{act}$$\n$$V_{act} = 2(V_1 - V_0)$$\n\nWe can now write an expression for $V_{max}$ using only the experimental measurements $V_0$ and $V_1$.\n$$V_{max} = V_{leak} + V_{act}$$\nSubstituting $V_{leak} = V_0$ and $V_{act} = 2(V_1 - V_0)$:\n$$V_{max} = V_0 + 2(V_1 - V_0) = V_0 + 2V_1 - 2V_0$$\n$$V_{max} = 2V_1 - V_0$$\n\nFinally, we can compute the dynamic range, which is the ratio $\\frac{V_{max}}{V_{min}}$.\n$$\\text{Dynamic Range} = \\frac{V_{max}}{V_{min}} = \\frac{2V_1 - V_0}{V_0}$$\nThis expression gives the dynamic range of the biosensor in terms of the two measured rates, $V_0$ and $V_1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2V_1 - V_0}{V_0}}$$", "id": "2025043"}, {"introduction": "While dynamic range describes the breadth of a sensor's response, the limit of detection (LOD) defines its sensitivity.
