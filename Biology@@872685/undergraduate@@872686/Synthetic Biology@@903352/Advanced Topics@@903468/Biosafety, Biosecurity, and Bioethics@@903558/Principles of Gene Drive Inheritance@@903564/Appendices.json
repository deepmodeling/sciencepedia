{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The power of a gene drive lies in its ability to defy the 50/50 odds of Mendelian inheritance. This \"super-Mendelian\" inheritance ensures that the drive allele is passed on to a majority of offspring, allowing it to spread rapidly through a population. This first exercise provides a fundamental starting point by asking you to calculate the basic inheritance rate of a gene drive from hypothetical experimental data, giving you a clear, quantitative measure of a drive's efficacy compared to normal genetic transmission [@problem_id:2056818].", "problem": "Researchers are developing a synthetic gene drive system to control the population of an invasive mosquito species. The system is based on a single gene where the gene drive allele, denoted as $g_d$, is designed to bias its own inheritance. The corresponding wild-type allele is denoted as $+$.\n\nTo test the efficacy of the drive, a laboratory cross is performed. A single male mosquito that is heterozygous for the gene drive ($g_d/+$) is mated with a wild-type female mosquito ($+/+$). After the mating, a large number of offspring are produced and their genotypes are analyzed. Out of a total of 300 offspring produced from this cross, 270 are found to carry the gene drive allele $g_d$.\n\nBased on these experimental results, calculate the observed inheritance rate of the gene drive allele, $g_d$.

The desired outcome, homing, competes with other DNA repair pathways like Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), which can create resistance alleles that the drive can no longer target. This practice explores this critical dynamic by challenging you to calculate the homing efficiency from data that includes not only drive-carrying and wild-type offspring, but also those with newly formed resistance alleles, reflecting a key challenge in designing effective gene drives [@problem_id:2056839].", "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists is developing a strategy to control populations of a mosquito species that acts as a vector for a tropical disease. Their approach involves a gene drive system based on Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR). This system is designed to bias inheritance in favor of a specific allele, called the gene drive allele ($g_d$).\n\nThe mechanism functions within the germline of mosquitoes that are heterozygous for the drive, having one drive allele and one wild-type allele ($g_d/+$). The gene drive cassette expresses a nuclease guided by a guide RNA (gRNA) to cut the DNA of the wild-type allele at a specific target site. The cell's natural DNA repair machinery then resolves the break. This can happen in two primary ways:\n1.  **Homology-Directed Repair (HDR)**: The break is repaired using the intact homologous chromosome (the one carrying the $g_d$ allele) as a template. This process, known as \"homing,\" effectively copies the drive allele into the place of the wild-type allele.\n2.  **Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ)**: The broken DNA ends are ligated back together. This process is error-prone and can introduce small insertions or deletions, creating a new \"resistance\" allele ($r$) that is no longer recognized by the gRNA and is often non-functional.\n\nTo quantify the performance of their system, the researchers conduct a standard test cross. A single male mosquito that is heterozygous for the gene drive ($g_d/+$) is crossed with a large population of wild-type female mosquitoes ($+/+$). All surviving F1 progeny are collected and their genotypes are determined.\n\nOut of a total of 400 offspring from this cross, the scientists observe:\n- 380 offspring carrying the gene drive allele.\n- 10 offspring carrying a newly formed resistance allele.\n- The remaining offspring are wild-type.\n\nBased on these experimental results, calculate the homing efficiency of this gene drive. The homing efficiency is defined as the fraction of wild-type alleles in the germline of the heterozygous parent that are successfully converted into gene drive alleles via homing. Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "The goal is to calculate the homing efficiency, which we will denote as $h$. The problem describes a cross between a heterozygous male ($g_d/+$) and wild-type females ($+/+$). The genotypes of the offspring are determined by the alleles present in the gametes of the parents. The wild-type females can only produce gametes containing the wild-type allele ($+$). Therefore, the distribution of genotypes in the F1 progeny directly reflects the frequency of different alleles in the gametes produced by the heterozygous male.\n\nLet's model the production of gametes in the $g_d/+$ male. In standard Mendelian inheritance, this male would produce 50% $g_d$ gametes and 50% $+$ gametes. However, the gene drive mechanism alters the alleles in the germline cells before meiosis is completed.\n\nConsider the pool of homologous chromosomes in the germline that initially carry the wild-type allele ($+$). The gene drive acts on this pool.\n- Let $h$ be the homing efficiency, which is the fraction of these $+$ alleles that are converted to $g_d$ alleles.\n- Let $f_r$ be the resistance formation rate, which is the fraction of these $+$ alleles that are converted to $r$ alleles.\n- The remaining fraction, $(1 - h - f_r)$, of these alleles are not modified and stay as $+$.\n\nNow, we can determine the overall frequencies of the three types of gametes produced by the $g_d/+$ male.\nHalf of the gametes (50%) will receive the chromosome that originally carried the $g_d$ allele. The other half (50%) will receive the other homologous chromosome, which has been subject to modification by the drive. The alleles on this second chromosome will be $g_d$, $r$, or $+$ with proportions $h$, $f_r$, and $(1-h-f_r)$, respectively.\n\nThe total frequency for each gamete type is therefore:\n- Frequency of $g_d$ gametes, $F(g_d) =$ (from the original $g_d$ chromosome) + (from conversion of the $+$ chromosome)\n$F(g_d) = 0.5 + 0.5 \\times h = 0.5(1+h)$\n- Frequency of $r$ gametes, $F(r) = 0.5 \\times f_r$\n- Frequency of $+$ gametes, $F(+) = 0.5 \\times (1 - h - f_r)$\n\nSince the female parent is $+/+$, the proportion of each offspring genotype is equal to the frequency of the corresponding gamete from the male parent.\n- Proportion of drive-carrying offspring ($g_d/+$) = $P(g_d/+) = 0.5(1+h)$\n- Proportion of resistance-carrying offspring ($r/+$) = $P(r/+) = 0.5f_r$\n- Proportion of wild-type offspring ($+/+$) = $P(+/+) = 0.5(1-h-f_r)$\n\nThe problem provides the following data from a total of $N=400$ offspring:\n- Number of drive-carrying offspring, $N_{g_d} = 380$.\n- Number of resistance-carrying offspring, $N_r = 10$.\n- The number of wild-type offspring is the remainder: $N_+ = N - N_{g_d} - N_r = 400 - 380 - 10 = 10$.\n\nFrom this data, we can calculate the observed proportions of each genotype:\n- Observed proportion of $g_d/+$ offspring: $\\hat{P}(g_d/+) = \\frac{N_{g_d}}{N} = \\frac{380}{400} = 0.95$.\n- Observed proportion of $r/+$ offspring: $\\hat{P}(r/+) = \\frac{N_r}{N} = \\frac{10}{400} = 0.025$.\n- Observed proportion of $+/+$ offspring: $\\hat{P}(+/+) = \\frac{N_+}{N} = \\frac{10}{400} = 0.025$.\n\nTo find the homing efficiency $h$, we equate the theoretical proportion of drive-carrying offspring to the observed proportion:\n$$P(g_d/+) = \\hat{P}(g_d/+)$$\n$$0.5(1+h) = 0.95$$\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n$$1+h = 1.9$$\nSolving for $h$:\n$$h = 1.9 - 1 = 0.9$$\n\nThe homing efficiency is 0.9.\n\nWe can also calculate the resistance formation rate $f_r$ to ensure our model is consistent with all the data.\n$$P(r/+) = \\hat{P}(r/+)$$\n$$0.5f_r = 0.025$$\n$$f_r = 2 \\times 0.025 = 0.05$$\nNow, we can check these values using the proportion of wild-type offspring.\n$$P(+/+) = 0.5(1 - h - f_r) = 0.5(1 - 0.9 - 0.05) = 0.5(0.05) = 0.025$$\nThis theoretical proportion matches the observed proportion $\\hat{P}(+/+) = 0.025$, confirming the consistency of our calculations.
