One explicit universal requirement is that personnel must wash their hands after handling biological materials, after removing gloves, and before leaving the laboratory. This is a core BSL-1 practice and applies to all experiments conducted at BSL-1, including recombinant DNA work in non-pathogenic, laboratory-adapted strains of *Escherichia coli*.\n\nOption A is not universally mandated at BSL-1: posting a universal biohazard sign at the entrance is required when infectious agents are present; it is conditional and not necessarily applicable to all BSL-1 work, and the requirement to specify agents on the sign is not universally mandated.\n\nOption C is a BSL-2 containment practice: conducting aerosol-generating procedures in a certified Class II Biological Safety Cabinet is not required at BSL-1, where the requirement is to minimize splashes and aerosols but not necessarily to use a BSC.\n\nOption D is overly specific and incorrect: BSL-1 requires work surfaces to be decontaminated at least daily and after spills using an appropriate disinfectant; it does not mandate a 10 percent bleach solution nor precisely the beginning and end of each workday.\n\nOption E is also overly broad and incorrect: BSL-1 requires decontamination of cultures, stocks, and other potential biohazardous materials before disposal by an effective method (e.g., autoclaving), but it does not universally require that all liquid waste be autoclaved before discharge to the sanitary sewer; acceptable methods can include chemical disinfection in accordance with institutional and local regulations.\n\nTherefore, the practice explicitly mandated for all BSL-1 work among the options listed is that persons must wash their hands after handling biological materials and before exiting the laboratory.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2050653"}, {"introduction": "Modern synthetic biology frequently employs powerful tools derived from pathogenic sources, such as lentiviral vectors. A critical skill is to assess the risk of the engineered system, which is often significantly lower than that of its parental counterpart. This practice [@problem_id:2050711] challenges you to determine the correct Risk Group classification for a common experimental setup, a decision that directly dictates the required safety protocols and containment level.", "problem": "A synthetic biology research team is designing an experiment to study gene expression in the human immune system. The plan is to use a third-generation, replication-incompetent lentiviral vector to deliver a gene into primary human T-cells cultured *in vitro*. The lentiviral vector system is derived from the Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1). The gene to be delivered encodes for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), a non-toxic reporter protein with no known pathogenic activity. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, what is the appropriate Risk Group (RG) classification that dictates the minimum required biosafety containment level for conducting this experiment?\n\nA. RG1\n\nB. RG2\n\nC. RG3\n\nD. RG4\n\nE. Exempt from NIH Guidelines", "solution": "1) Identify the parental agent and its Risk Group under NIH Guidelines. The lentiviral vector system is derived from HIV-1. HIV-1 as an agent is classified as Risk Group 3 (RG3) because it is associated with serious or lethal human disease, although preventive or therapeutic interventions exist.\n\n2) Determine whether the derivative vector retains the RG of the parental agent. The system described is a third-generation, replication-incompetent lentiviral vector. In such systems, essential genes for replication are split across multiple plasmids and deleted from the transfer vector, and self-inactivating long terminal repeats are commonly used. This design prevents the production of replication-competent virus in the experimental setting, significantly reducing risk relative to the parental RG3 agent.\n\n3) Incorporate the nature of the transgene into the risk assessment. The transgene is GFP, a non-toxic reporter with no known pathogenic activity or toxicity. The absence of hazardous gene products further reduces risk and does not elevate the classification.\n\n4) Apply NIH Guidelines for recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid research with non-replicating lentiviral vectors. Under the NIH Guidelines, replication-incompetent lentiviral vectors derived from RG3 agents (such as HIV-1) are generally handled at Biosafety Level 2 with appropriate enhancements, and are considered RG2 agents for containment purposes when the insert does not increase hazard. This reflects that such vectors can infect and integrate into human cells but do not replicate or cause the disease associated with the RG3 parental virus.\n\n5) Consider the host system and setting. The work is conducted in vitro with primary human T-cells. Use of human primary cells is managed at a minimum of BSL-2 due to potential exposure to human materials and the integration-competent but replication-incompetent vector. There is no feature in this scenario (e.g., hazardous transgene, replication-competence, in vivo work) that would elevate the RG beyond RG2 or justify RG1 or exemption.\n\n6) Exclusion of other options. It is not RG1 because the vector can infect human cells and integrates into the genome, posing risks inconsistent with RG1. It is not RG3 or RG4 because the vector is replication-incompetent and lacks the disease-causing potential of HIV-1. It is not exempt from NIH Guidelines because experiments using replication-incompetent viral vectors fall under the purview of the Guidelines and require IBC review and BSL-2 containment.\n\n7) Conclusion. The appropriate Risk Group classification for this experiment, which dictates the minimum required biosafety containment level, is RG2.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2050711"}, {"introduction": "Scientific inquiry is a journey into the unknown, and experiments can yield surprising results that alter the initial risk assessment. This final, advanced scenario [@problem_id:2050689] places you in the role of a Principal Investigator whose experiment has unexpectedly generated a more hazardous agent. Your task is to navigate the procedural and ethical responsibilities required by the NIH Guidelines when the safety parameters of your research fundamentally change, testing your understanding of a researcher's duty to report and re-evaluate risk.", "problem": "Dr. Aris Thorne is a Principal Investigator (PI) conducting a Long-Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE) to study the development of antibiotic resistance. The experiment involves serially passaging a non-pathogenic, laboratory-adapted strain of *Escherichia coli* K-12 in a chemostat containing sub-lethal concentrations of a novel synthetic antibiotic. *E. coli* K-12 is classified as a Risk Group 1 (RG1) agent, and accordingly, the research protocol was registered with the university's Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) under Section III-E of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules. The work is being conducted at Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1).\n\nAfter 1,500 generations, Dr. Thorne isolates a clone that exhibits an exceptionally high level of resistance to the antibiotic. To characterize this evolved strain further, he initiates a collaboration with a colleague to test its effects in a standard C57BL/6 murine model, a procedure approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) based on the use of an RG1 agent. To his surprise, intravenous inoculation with the evolved strain results in systemic infection and mortality within 48 hours in all tested mice. The ancestral *E. coli* K-12 strain, used as a control, remains completely avirulent. This result strongly suggests that in the process of evolving antibiotic resistance, the strain has inadvertently acquired novel virulence factors, warranting its reclassification as, at minimum, an RG2 agent.\n\nAccording to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, which of the following sequences of actions represents the most appropriate and compliant immediate response for Dr. Thorne?\n\nA. Continue the LTEE experiment as planned to gather more data on the emergence of virulence, while beginning to draft a new protocol amendment to be submitted to the IBC at the next scheduled meeting.\n\nB. Immediately terminate the experiment by autoclaving all evolved bacterial cultures, sterilizing the chemostat, and then reporting the incident and the corrective actions taken to the IBC.\n\nC. Immediately cease all experimental manipulations involving the evolved virulent strain, secure all existing cultures within the BSL-1 laboratory, report the findings to the institution's Biosafety Officer and IBC, and prepare a new registration document to reclassify the experiment under Section III-D for work at BSL-2.\n\nD. Bypass the local IBC and report the unexpected evolution of a virulent agent directly to the NIH Office of Science Policy (OSP), as the Guidelines are a federal policy.\n\nE. Report the findings only to the IACUC, since the virulence was discovered in an animal model and directly impacts the approved animal protocol.\n\nF. Argue to the IBC that since the virulence has only been shown in mice and not humans, and the parental strain is RG1, the experiment can continue at BSL-1 with enhanced personal protective equipment.", "solution": "We begin by identifying the regulatory framework and risk classification. The ancestral agent is *Escherichia coli* K-12, a Risk Group 1 (RG1) organism, registered under Section III-E of the NIH Guidelines and handled at Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1). The unexpected result—systemic infection and uniform mortality in a standard murine model after intravenous challenge with the evolved clone—indicates that the evolved strain has acquired virulence consistent with, at minimum, Risk Group 2 (RG2) characteristics. Under the NIH Guidelines, RG classification informs the biosafety containment level, with RG2 agents requiring BSL-2 practices and facilities.\n\nNext, we apply the PI responsibilities under the NIH Guidelines. The Guidelines require PIs to:\n- Immediately report significant problems, violations, or research-related accidents and illnesses to the Biological Safety Officer (BSO), the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), and other appropriate institutional officials.\n- Not initiate or continue experiments that require IBC approval until such approval has been obtained (Section III-D experiments require IBC approval prior to initiation).\n- Implement appropriate containment and cease manipulations when risk changes indicate current containment is insufficient.\n\nBecause the evolved strain plausibly reclassifies the work from a Section III-E activity to a Section III-D activity (work with RG2 agents or work that requires BSL-2 containment), any continuation without prior IBC review and approval would be non-compliant. Therefore, the immediate actions must include halting manipulations, securing the agent to prevent exposure or release, and promptly notifying the BSO and IBC so that risk assessment, containment upgrades (to BSL-2), and re-registration under Section III-D can proceed.\n\nWe now evaluate the options against these requirements:\n\n- Option A (continue experiment while drafting an amendment for the next IBC meeting) is non-compliant because it proposes continuing work that now requires higher containment and prior IBC approval. Immediate continuation at BSL-1 after discovering a shift to RG2-level risk violates the Guidelines.\n- Option B (immediately autoclave all evolved cultures and sterilize, then report) is not the most appropriate immediate response under the Guidelines. While risk mitigation is essential, unilateral destruction precludes confirmatory analyses and appropriate institutional review of the event; the Guidelines emphasize immediate cessation, securing materials, and reporting for IBC-directed corrective action and reclassification rather than automatically destroying all materials without institutional oversight.\n- Option C (cease manipulations, secure cultures, report to BSO and IBC, and prepare new III-D registration for BSL-2 work) exactly matches the NIH Guidelines’ expectations: stop work when risk changes, secure materials, promptly notify institutional biosafety authorities, and obtain IBC approval for the appropriate containment (BSL-2) before any further work.\n- Option D (bypass IBC and report directly to NIH OSP) is improper. The institution and IBC oversee local compliance and reporting. Institutional officials, not the PI acting alone, are responsible for required reporting to NIH OSP when applicable.\n- Option E (report only to IACUC) is incomplete and non-compliant; IBC/BSO notification is required because the biosafety risk classification and containment requirements have changed.\n- Option F (continue at BSL-1 with enhanced PPE) is non-compliant; RG2 work demands BSL-2 facilities and procedures and IBC approval under Section III-D, not ad hoc PPE enhancements within BSL-1.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate and compliant immediate response under the NIH Guidelines is to stop manipulations, secure the materials, notify the BSO and IBC, and re-register the work under Section III-D for BSL-2 containment before proceeding.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2050689"}]}
