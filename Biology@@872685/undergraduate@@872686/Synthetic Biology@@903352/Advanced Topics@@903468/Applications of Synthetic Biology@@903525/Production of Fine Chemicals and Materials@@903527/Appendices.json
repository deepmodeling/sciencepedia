They have designed a novel three-enzyme linear pathway: $S \\xrightarrow{E_1} I_1 \\xrightarrow{E_2} I_2 \\xrightarrow{E_3} P$. In this pathway, an abundant cellular substrate $S$ is converted by enzyme $E_1$ into intermediate $I_1$. Intermediate $I_1$ is then the substrate for enzyme $E_2$, which converts it to $I_2$. Finally, enzyme $E_3$ converts $I_2$ into the desired product $P$.\n\nThe initial substrate, $S$, is supplied continuously to the cells and its concentration can be considered constant and non-limiting. Kinetic analysis of the purified enzymes reveals that $E_1$ and $E_3$ have moderate catalytic efficiencies.
