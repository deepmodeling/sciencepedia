The first two steps of the pathway involve the conversion of a cellular precursor by enzyme PnkA, followed by the modification of the resulting intermediate by enzyme PnkB. To optimize production, both enzymes must be expressed concurrently from a single plasmid.\n\nYou are tasked with designing the genetic construct (operon) for this purpose using a library of standardized biological parts. An operon is a functional unit of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) containing a cluster of genes under the control of a single promoter.\n\nThe available parts are:\n-   **Promoter:** `pCon` (a strong, constitutive promoter that continuously initiates transcription)\n-   **Ribosome Binding Site (RBS):** `R01` (a standard sequence that initiates translation)\n-   **Coding Sequence (CDS):** `pnkA` (the DNA sequence that codes for the PnkA enzyme)\n-   **Coding Sequence (CDS):** `pnkB` (the DNA sequence that codes for the PnkB enzyme)\n-   **Terminator:** `T_double` (a strong transcriptional terminator that stops transcription)\n\nEach part is a distinct DNA segment. To create the functional operon, these parts must be assembled in a specific linear sequence on the plasmid. The arrow `->` indicates the sequential fusion of these parts from the 5' to the 3' end of the DNA strand.

This places one promoter at the 5' end, provides an RBS for each CDS, keeps both CDSs in the same transcriptional unit, and ends with a terminator. This satisfies all operon requirements for expressing both PnkA and PnkB from a single promoter.\n- Option B: pCon -> R01 -> pnkA -> pnkB -> T_double. This lacks an RBS before the second coding sequence, which is generally required in standardized constructs to ensure translation of the downstream gene. Therefore, it does not reliably produce PnkB.\n- Option C: pCon -> pnkA -> R01 -> pnkB -> R01 -> T_double. The first CDS lacks an upstream RBS, and there is an RBS placed after a CDS without a following CDS at the end. This does not satisfy the required order for translation of both genes.\n- Option D: pCon -> R01 -> pnkA -> T_double -> pCon -> R01 -> pnkB -> T_double. This contains a terminator between the two genes and a second promoter, creating two separate transcriptional units, not a single polycistronic operon.\n- Option E: R01 -> pCon -> pnkA -> R01 -> pnkB -> T_double. An RBS cannot function upstream of a promoter, so the arrangement is invalid at the 5' end.\n\nTherefore, only Option A conforms to the required design for a single, polycistronic operon that expresses both PnkA and PnkB.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2057701"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the basic architecture of a genetic circuit, a crucial design choice is its control system. This problem explores the strategic trade-off between continuous (constitutive) and switchable (inducible) expression, a decision that hinges on the concept of metabolic load. Understanding how to balance the cell's own growth with the demands of production is key to maximizing the final yield in a bioreactor [@problem_id:2057730].", "problem": "A biotechnology company is engineering the bacterium *Escherichia coli* to serve as a microbial factory for a high-value vitamin. The biosynthetic pathway for this vitamin is metabolically expensive, consuming a significant fraction of the cell's ATP and precursor molecules. This energetic and material cost imposes a high metabolic load on the host cells. However, experimental data confirms that the final vitamin product is entirely non-toxic to *E. coli*, even when it accumulates to high intracellular concentrations.\n\nThe engineering team must select a promoter system to control the expression of the genes in the vitamin's biosynthetic pathway. Their objective is to maximize the final total yield of the vitamin produced in a fixed-volume batch fermentation process. They are considering the following two options:\n\n*   **System A:** A strong, constitutive promoter that will drive high-level expression of the pathway genes continuously throughout the entire growth and production cycle.\n*   **System B:** A tightly regulated, inducible promoter that has negligible basal expression (is \"off\") but can be activated to drive high-level expression upon the addition of an inexpensive, non-metabolizable inducer molecule.\n\nBased on this scenario, which system should the team choose, and what is the primary scientific reason for that choice?\n\nA. System A, because continuous production from the start of the fermentation will lead to the highest total yield.\n\nB. System B, because it will prevent the non-toxic vitamin from accumulating to levels that might inhibit cell growth.\n\nC. System A, as it avoids the potential cost and toxicity associated with the inducer molecule.\n\nD.

In a batch of duration $T$, the total vitamin produced is proportional to the time integral of the specific production rate multiplied by the biomass concentration:\n$$\nY_{\\text{tot}}=\\int_{0}^{T} q_{p}(t)\\,X(t)\\,dt,\n$$\nwhere $q_{p}(t)$ is the specific production rate and $X(t)$ is the cell density. The biomass dynamics follow $X(t)=X(0)\\exp\\!\\left(\\int_{0}^{t}\\mu(\\tau)\\,d\\tau\\right)$, where $\\mu$ is the specific growth rate.\n\nGiven that the biosynthetic pathway imposes a high metabolic load, turning the pathway on reduces the effective growth rate due to diversion of ATP and precursors, i.e., $\\mu_{\\text{on}}<\\mu_{\\text{off}}$. Under System A (constitutive, always on), cells experience burden from the start, so $X_{\\text{A}}(t)$ remains low because $\\mu=\\mu_{\\text{on}}$ throughout. Although $q_{p}$ is high early, the integrand $q_{p}(t)X(t)$ is limited by the low $X(t)$, reducing $Y_{\\text{tot}}$.\n\nUnder System B (tight inducible), before induction $q_{p}\\approx 0$ but $\\mu\\approx\\mu_{\\text{off}}$, allowing rapid biomass accumulation to a high $X(t_{i})$ by the induction time $t_{i}$. After induction, $q_{p}$ becomes high while $X(t)$ is already large, so the post-induction integral $\\int_{t_{i}}^{T} q_{p}(t)\\,X(t)\\,dt$ is maximized. Because the product is experimentally confirmed non-toxic even at high intracellular concentrations, there is no need to limit accumulation; thus preventing accumulation is not a valid primary objective. The inducer is inexpensive and non-metabolizable, and no toxicity is indicated, so avoiding an inducer is not the main design driver. Stability of expression is also secondary to the dominant effect of growth–production decoupling on $Y_{\\text{tot}}$.\n\nTherefore, to maximize $Y_{\\text{tot}}$, the team should select the inducible system to separate a high-$\\mu$ growth phase from a high-$q_{p}$ production phase, imposing the metabolic load only after achieving high cell density.
