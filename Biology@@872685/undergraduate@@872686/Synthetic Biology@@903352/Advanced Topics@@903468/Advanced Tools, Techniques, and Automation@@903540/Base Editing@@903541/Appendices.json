{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before embarking on a laboratory experiment, the first crucial step in any base editing project is the computational design and feasibility analysis. This involves carefully examining the DNA sequence to ensure the target nucleotide can be reached by the editing machinery. This practice problem challenges you to integrate the two most fundamental constraints of a CRISPR-based editor: the requirement for a specific Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) and the limited \"editing window\" where the deaminase enzyme is active. Mastering this type of analysis is essential for successfully designing guide RNAs that can direct the editor to the correct location and perform the desired change. [@problem_id:2021034]", "problem": "The CRISPR-Cas9 system from *Streptococcus pyogenes* (SpCas9) is a powerful tool for genome engineering. For therapeutic applications like base editing, a catalytically inactive or \"dead\" Cas9 (dCas9) is fused to a deaminase enzyme. This entire complex is guided to a specific DNA locus by a guide RNA (gRNA). For the SpCas9 system to bind to the DNA, the target site must contain a specific Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence. For SpCas9, the canonical PAM is 5'-NGG-3', where N can be any nucleotide. This PAM must be located on the DNA strand that is *not* bound by the gRNA (this strand is often called the non-target strand), immediately downstream (at the 3' end) of the 20-nucleotide sequence that is complementary to the gRNA's spacer region.\n\nAdenine Base Editors (ABEs), a class of base editors, utilize an engineered adenine deaminase enzyme to convert a target adenine (A) on the non-target strand to inosine (I). The cell's replication and repair machinery subsequently interprets inosine as guanine (G), resulting in a permanent A•T to G•C base pair conversion. This editing process is not perfectly precise and is constrained to a specific \"editing window\" along the protospacer. For a standard ABE constructed with SpCas9, this editing window typically spans positions 4 through 8. The positions are numbered 1 to 20 along the protospacer on the non-target strand, with position 1 being the furthest from the PAM and position 20 being the closest (i.e., immediately adjacent to the PAM).\n\nA scientist is attempting to correct a disease-causing mutation in a human cell line. The required correction is an A-to-G point mutation. The DNA sequence of the non-target strand surrounding the target adenine, [A], is as follows:\n5'- GTC AAG CTA CAT T[A]T GG CTT CGA -3'\n\nBased on the operational principles of the standard SpCas9-based ABE, which of the following statements correctly assesses the feasibility of performing the desired edit at this specific locus?\n\nA. It is feasible. A gRNA can be designed to use the 5'-TGG-3' sequence as a PAM, which would place the target [A] at a position that allows for efficient editing.\n\nB. It is not feasible. The required PAM sequence for SpCas9 is 5'-NGG-3', and no such sequence is present in the provided target locus.\n\nC. It is not feasible. The target adenine [A] is located at position 19 relative to the only available PAM (5'-TGG-3'), which is outside the canonical editing window of positions 4-8.\n\nD. It is feasible. Although the 5'-TGG-3' sequence places the target [A] outside the editing window, a different gRNA can be designed targeting a PAM further downstream, which would position [A] correctly.", "solution": "The solution requires a systematic analysis of the provided DNA sequence based on the rules for SpCas9-based adenine base editors.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Components and Constraints**\n- **Target Edit:** A-to-G conversion.\n- **Enzyme System:** SpCas9-based Adenine Base Editor (ABE).\n- **PAM Requirement:** A 5'-NGG-3' motif must be present on the non-target strand, immediately 3' to the protospacer.\n- **Editing Window:** The target 'A' must be within positions 4 to 8 of the protospacer.\n- **Positioning:** Position 20 is closest to the PAM; position 1 is furthest.\n- **Target Sequence (non-target strand):** 5'- GTC AAG CTA CAT T[A]T GG CTT CGA -3'\n\n**Step 2: Scan for a Valid PAM**\nWe search the sequence for a 5'-NGG-3' motif. The sequence `TGG` is found just downstream of the target adenine [A]. This `TGG` matches the `NGG` pattern (where N=T) and is the only valid PAM in the provided sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Target Base Position**\nThe PAM (`TGG`) is located at the 3' end of the protospacer region. According to the numbering convention, the nucleotide on the non-target strand immediately 5' to the PAM is at position 20.\n- Sequence: `... T [A] T GG ...`\n- PAM: `TGG`\n- The base immediately before the PAM is `T`. This is **position 20**.\n- The base before that is the target `[A]`. This is **position 19**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare Target Position with Editing Window**\nThe specified editing window is from positions 4 to 8. The target adenine `[A]` is at position 19. Since 19 is outside the 4-8 window, the edit is not feasible with this standard ABE.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Options**\n*   **A. It is feasible... places the target [A] at a position that allows for efficient editing.** This is incorrect. The target is at position 19, outside the editing window.\n*   **B. It is not feasible. ... no such sequence is present...** This is incorrect. The sequence `TGG` serves as a valid PAM.\n*   **C. It is not feasible. The target adenine [A] is located at position 19 relative to the only available PAM (5'-TGG-3'), which is outside the canonical editing window of positions 4-8.** This statement is correct. It correctly identifies the PAM, the target position, and concludes that the position is outside the active window.\n*   **D. It is feasible. ... a different gRNA can be designed targeting a PAM further downstream...** This is incorrect. Based on the provided sequence, no other PAM is available.\n\n**Conclusion:** The edit is not feasible because the only available PAM positions the target base at position 19, which is outside the editor's active window.

A CBE system consists of a guide RNA (gRNA) that directs a catalytically impaired Cas nuclease, fused to a cytosine deaminase enzyme, to a specific location on the DNA. The gRNA binds to a 20-nucleotide sequence on one strand, known as the protospacer, which is adjacent to a Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). The deaminase then chemically modifies cytosine bases on the opposite, non-binding strand.\n\nHowever, the deaminase is not perfectly specific and can edit any cytosine within a certain \"editing window,\" typically a small range of positions. This can lead to unintended \"bystander\" edits.\n\nConsider a synthetic DNA target sequence shown below. A CBE is designed to target this sequence. The gRNA is complementary to the 20-nucleotide protospacer on the bottom strand. Consequently, the editing activity will occur on the top strand.
