The experimental protocol involves repeatedly culturing the bacteria in a liquid medium containing the biofuel. Each day, the bacterial culture is allowed to grow for 24 hours. At the end of the 24-hour period, a small volume of the culture is transferred to a flask of fresh growth medium, effectively diluting the bacterial population. This process is repeated daily.\n\nIn this specific experiment, the dilution performed every 24 hours is 1:1000, meaning that the number of cells at the start of a growth cycle is 1/1000th of the number of cells at the end of the previous cycle. The experiment is run continuously for a total of 50 days.\n\nAssuming the culture grows from its diluted state back to the same cell density by the end of each 24-hour period, calculate the total number of generations that have elapsed over the entire 50-day experiment.

By understanding the selective pressures we impose, we can often predict the evolutionary trajectory a system will take. This problem [@problem_id:2017282] presents a classic scenario in metabolic engineering where a synthetic pathway is hampered by a toxic intermediate, creating a strong selection pressure. Your task is to deduce which part of the pathway is most likely to evolve to alleviate this bottleneck, enhancing both cellular fitness and the production of the desired compound.", "problem": "A synthetic biology research team has engineered a strain of *Escherichia coli* to produce a valuable chemical, Compound C, from a cheap precursor, Substrate A. The engineered metabolic pathway consists of two enzymatic steps:\n\n1.  Substrate A is converted to Intermediate B by Enzyme E1.\n2.  Intermediate B is converted to Compound C by Enzyme E2.\n\nDuring initial testing, the engineered strain exhibits very poor growth and low production yields of Compound C. Further investigation reveals that Intermediate B is highly toxic to the cells, and its accumulation severely inhibits cell division and metabolic function.\n\nTo overcome this limitation, the team performs an Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE) experiment. They continuously culture the engineered strain for several hundred generations in a liquid medium that supplies a constant concentration of Substrate A. The goal is to select for mutant strains that can grow more robustly in these conditions.\n\nAfter the experiment, they successfully isolate a mutant strain that demonstrates significantly faster growth and a higher rate of Compound C production compared to the original engineered strain.

The intracellular concentration of the toxic intermediate $[B]$ obeys the mass balance\n$$\n\\frac{d[B]}{dt}=v_{1}-v_{2}.\n$$\nIn a growing culture operating under quasi-steady state for intermediates, we have $v_{1}=v_{2}$ and the production rate of $C$ equals this common flux. Toxicity reduces growth as an increasing function of $[B]$, so improved growth requires lowering $[B]$ while maintaining or increasing flux to $C$.\n\nAssume Michaelis-Menten form for each step:\n$$\nv_{1}=\\frac{V_{\\max,1}[A]}{K_{m,1}+[A]},\\quad v_{2}=\\frac{V_{\\max,2}[B]}{K_{m,2}+[B]}.\n$$\nAt steady state $v_{1}=v_{2}$.

While whole-genome sequencing is the gold standard, rapid and targeted screening methods are invaluable for quickly testing specific hypotheses about adaptive outcomes. This final practice [@problem_id:2017304] challenges you to design a simple molecular tool using PCR and gel electrophoresis. The goal is to devise a screen that can reliably distinguish between two plausible evolutionary solutions: complete loss of a synthetic plasmid versus a more subtle, targeted mutation within it.", "problem": "A researcher is conducting an Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE) experiment, a process where a microbial population is cultured under specific selective pressures for many generations to drive the evolution of desired traits. The starting organism is a strain of *Escherichia coli* engineered to carry a synthetic plasmid. This plasmid has three key functional regions:\n\n1.  An origin of replication (`ori`), which is essential for the plasmid to be copied by the host cell's machinery.\n2.  An ampicillin resistance gene (`ampR`), which confers resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin.\n3.  A gene named `toxG`, which produces a protein that is mildly toxic, causing a reduction in the cell's growth rate.\n\nThe bacteria are grown in a medium without ampicillin, meaning there is no positive selection to maintain the plasmid. The selective pressure is for faster growth, which creates a strong incentive for the cells to eliminate the metabolic burden imposed by the `toxG` gene product. After hundreds of generations, the researcher isolates several colonies that exhibit significantly faster growth. The researcher hypothesizes that there are two primary mechanisms for this adaptation: (1) a small, inactivating mutation (like a point mutation or a small deletion) has occurred within the `toxG` gene, or (2) the cell has lost the entire plasmid.\n\nThe researcher wants to use a simple, rapid screening method based on Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and subsequent gel electrophoresis to distinguish between these two outcomes. Which of the following PCR primer design strategies would be the most reliable for cleanly differentiating cells that have lost the *entire* plasmid from those that have likely acquired a small, inactivating mutation specifically within the `toxG` gene?\n\nA. Using a pair of primers that anneal to and amplify a 200 base-pair segment from the middle of the `toxG` gene.\n\nB.

Using one primer that anneals within the `ori` region and a second primer that anneals within the `ampR` region, designed to amplify the large segment of the plasmid between them.\n\nE. Using a single primer that anneals within the `toxG` gene, with the goal of detecting linearized plasmid fragments on the gel.", "solution": "We want a PCR-based screen that yields a clear presence/absence readout on a gel distinguishing (i) cells that still carry the plasmid but have inactivated only the toxG gene by a small mutation, from (ii) cells that have lost the entire plasmid. The relevant PCR principle is that amplification occurs only if the template region bounded by both primers is present and sufficiently intact for both primers to anneal; absence of the template (e.g., plasmid loss) yields no band. For robust screening, a short amplicon (on the order of a few hundred base pairs) in a region that is not under selection for mutation is preferable, because it minimizes false negatives caused by mutations disrupting primer binding sites or producing very large amplicon-size changes.\n\nEvaluate each option with respect to these principles:\n- A: Primers within toxG will produce a band if toxG is present and unaltered in the primer-binding sites and amplicon, and no band if the plasmid is lost. However, the selective pressure directly targets toxG; small inactivating mutations could occur anywhere in toxG, including primer binding sites or within the amplicon, causing amplification failure or ambiguous size shifts. This risks misclassifying toxG-mutant plasmid-bearing cells as plasmid-lost.\n- B: Primers within ampR target a plasmid backbone region not under selection in this experiment (ampicillin is absent), so it is more likely to remain intact in clones that retained the plasmid but mutated toxG. Thus, plasmid-bearing toxG mutants should yield a clear band, while plasmid-loss clones yield no band. This cleanly differentiates the two outcomes with high reliability.\n- C: Primers for a chromosomal housekeeping gene will amplify in both scenarios (plasmid present or absent), so they cannot distinguish plasmid loss from toxG mutation. They are useful as a positive control but not as the primary discriminator.\n- D: Primers spanning from ori to ampR are designed to amplify a large fragment. Large-amplicon PCR is inherently less robust and more failure-prone, risking false negatives even when the plasmid is present; this reduces reliability for rapid screening.\n- E: A single-primer PCR is not a standard, reliable method for detecting specific plasmid presence and would produce non-specific products; it will not provide a clean differentiation.\n\nTherefore, the most reliable strategy is to amplify a short internal segment of ampR, which reports plasmid presence independent of toxG mutations and distinguishes it from complete plasmid loss.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2017304"}]}
