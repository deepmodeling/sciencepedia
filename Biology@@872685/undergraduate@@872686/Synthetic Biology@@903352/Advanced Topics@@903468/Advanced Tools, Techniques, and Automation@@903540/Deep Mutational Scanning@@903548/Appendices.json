A common method for this involves synthesizing a degenerate oligonucleotide primer.\n\nConsider a researcher designing a saturation mutagenesis experiment for a single codon in a gene. The genetic code is based on codons, which are triplets of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) nucleotides. The researcher plans to use an oligonucleotide containing the degenerate codon 'NNK'. In this notation, which follows the standard International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) code, 'N' can be any of the four bases (Adenine 'A', Guanine 'G', Cytosine 'C', or Thymine 'T'), and 'K' can be either Guanine 'G' or Thymine 'T'.\n\nFor the purpose of your calculations, the three standard DNA stop codons are TAA, TAG, and TGA. Any of these codons will terminate protein synthesis.\n\nCalculate the following properties for a library generated using the 'NNK' scheme:\n1. The total number of unique DNA codons generated.\n2. The number of unique standard amino acids encoded by the 'NNK' codons.\n3. The total number of unique stop codons generated.\n\nPresent your three answers (total codons, number of amino acids, and number of stop codons, in that specific order) as a row matrix.", "solution": "We interpret the degenerate codon 'NNK' using the IUPAC code: each 'N' can be any of the four DNA bases $\\{A, C, G, T\\}$, and 'K' can be either $G$ or $T$. By the rule of product, the total number of unique DNA codons generated is\n$$\n4 \\times 4 \\times 2 = 32.\n$$\nNext, we determine how many of these codons are stop codons. The standard DNA stop codons are $TAA$, $TAG$, and $TGA$. For an 'NNK' codon, the third base must be either $G$ or $T$. Therefore:\n- $TAA$ ends with $A$ and is excluded.\n- $TAG$ ends with $G$ and is included.\n- $TGA$ ends with $A$ and is excluded.\nThus, exactly one stop codon is included:\n$$\n\\text{number of stop codons} = 1.\n$$\nThe number of sense codons generated is therefore $32 - 1 = 31$. To find the number of unique standard amino acids encoded, we must verify that every standard amino acid has at least one codon of the form 'NNK'. For each amino acid, at least one representative codon with third base $G$ or $T$ exists:\n- Alanine: $GCT$ or $GCG$.\n- Arginine: $CGT$ or $CGG$ (also $AGG$).\n- Asparagine: $AAT$.\n- Aspartate: $GAT$.\n- Cysteine: $TGT$.\n- Glutamine: $CAG$.\n- Glutamate: $GAG$.\n- Glycine: $GGT$ or $GGG$.\n- Histidine: $CAT$.\n- Isoleucine: $ATT$.\n- Leucine: $CTT$ or $CTG$ or $TTG$.\n- Lysine: $AAG$.\n- Methionine: $ATG$.\n- Phenylalanine: $TTT$.\n- Proline: $CCT$ or $CCG$.\n- Serine: $TCT$ or $TCG$ or $AGT$.\n- Threonine: $ACT$ or $ACG$.\n- Tryptophan: $TGG$.\n- Tyrosine: $TAT$.\n- Valine: $GTT$ or $GTG$.\nHence, all $20$ standard amino acids are represented:\n$$\n\\text{number of unique amino acids} = 20.\n$$\nCollecting the results in the requested order (total codons, number of amino acids, number of stop codons), we have the row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 32 & 20 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 32 & 20 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2029702"}, {"introduction": "The power of Deep Mutational Scanning lies in its comprehensiveness, but this creates a significant logistical challenge: ensuring every variant in a vast library is tested.
