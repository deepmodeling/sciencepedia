This first practice problem focuses on this fundamental skill of experimental validation. You will explore how to use the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to confirm the precise integration of a loxPsym site into a synthetic chromosome, a common task when building SCRaMbLE-ready yeast strains. The exercise requires you to compare different primer strategies and identify the one that provides the most unambiguous evidence, introducing the powerful concept of junction PCR [@problem_id:2066998].", "problem": "A synthetic biology research team is working on the SCRaMbLE (Synthetic Chromosome Rearrangement and Modification by LoxP-mediated Evolution) system in yeast. A key step is the targeted integration of a 34 base pair (bp) loxPsym site into a synthetic chromosome. The team aims to insert a single loxPsym site immediately after the stop codon of a gene named SYN1, which has a coding sequence of 900 bp. In the original, unmodified chromosome, the SYN1 stop codon is followed by a 250 bp downstream non-coding region.\n\nTo verify the success of the integration, the team designs four different oligonucleotide primers for use in a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay:\n- **Primer F1**: A forward primer that anneals to the coding strand of the SYN1 gene, with its 3' end located 100 bp upstream of the SYN1 stop codon.\n- **Primer R1**: A reverse primer that anneals to the template strand in the downstream non-coding region, with its 3' end located 150 bp downstream from the original position of the SYN1 stop codon.\n- **Primer F2**: A forward primer that anneals to the coding strand within the 34 bp loxPsym sequence.\n- **Primer R2**: A reverse primer that anneals to the template strand within the 34 bp loxPsym sequence.\n\nThe team considers four different PCR strategies to test colonies of yeast after the transformation procedure. Which of the following strategies provides the most specific and unambiguous evidence that the loxPsym site has been correctly integrated at its intended location immediately after the SYN1 gene?\n\nA. A PCR reaction with primers F1 and R1. The presence of a PCR product approximately 34 bp larger than the product from an unmodified yeast control is considered confirmation.\n\nB. A PCR reaction with primers F2 and R2. The presence of a PCR product of approximately 34 bp is considered confirmation.\n\nC. A PCR reaction with primers F1 and R2. The presence of a PCR product of a specific, predictable size is considered confirmation.\n\nD. A PCR reaction using two primers that both anneal within the SYN1 gene. The presence of a PCR product is considered confirmation.", "solution": "We use the principle of end-point PCR: a product is generated only when two primers anneal on the same DNA molecule in opposite orientations with their 3' ends pointing toward each other and are separated by a contiguous template segment. The amplified product length equals the distance from the 3' end of the forward primer to the 3' end of the reverse primer along the template.\n\nDefine symbols for distances given in the problem:\n- Let $u$ denote the distance from the 3' end of Primer F1 to the stop codon of SYN1, with $u=100\\,\\text{bp}$.\n- Let $d$ denote the distance from the stop codon to the 3' end of Primer R1 in the downstream region, with $d=150\\,\\text{bp}$.\n- Let $s$ denote the length of the loxPsym site, with $s=34\\,\\text{bp}$.\n\nEvaluate each strategy:\n\nA. Primers F1 and R1 flank the SYN1 stop region. In the unmodified chromosome, the F1–R1 amplicon length is\n$$\nL_{\\text{unmod}}=u+d.\n$$\nAfter correct integration of a single loxPsym immediately after the stop codon, the F1–R1 amplicon length becomes\n$$\nL_{\\text{mod}}=u+s+d,\n$$\nso the size shift is\n$$\n\\Delta L=L_{\\text{mod}}-L_{\\text{unmod}}=s.\n$$\nWhile a shift of $s$ suggests insertion of an element of the expected size at the intended locus, this does not unambiguously prove identity of the insert (it could be a different sequence of length $s$) nor confirm the precise junction sequence or orientation. Thus, it is supportive but not the most specific or unambiguous.\n\nB. Primers F2 and R2 both lie within the loxPsym sequence. The expected amplicon length is the internal distance between their 3' ends (at most $s$ and fixed by primer design). However, this product can arise from any loxPsym present anywhere in the genome or from residual donor DNA, and therefore does not demonstrate locus-specific integration. Hence, it lacks specificity for the intended location.\n\nC. Primers F1 and R2 constitute a junction PCR: F1 is in SYN1 upstream of the stop codon and R2 is within loxPsym. A product will be generated only if loxPsym is integrated immediately downstream of SYN1 in the correct orientation such that R2 faces toward F1 across the SYN1–loxPsym junction. The expected amplicon length is\n$$\nL_{\\text{F1–R2}}=u+\\delta,\n$$\nwhere $\\delta$ is the distance from the SYN1–loxPsym junction to the 3' end of R2 within the loxPsym sequence, determined by primer design. Absence of the loxPsym at the intended locus (or incorrect orientation) yields no product, and presence elsewhere cannot yield a product because F1 is locus-specific. This provides specific and unambiguous evidence of correct insertion at the intended site.\n\nD. Two primers within SYN1 only demonstrate the presence of the gene region and do not report on the presence or position of the loxPsym insertion. This cannot confirm correct integration.\n\nTherefore, the junction PCR in option C is the most specific and unambiguous test among the choices, as it directly assays the correct SYN1–loxPsym junction at the intended locus and orientation with a predictable product size defined by primer positions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2066998"}, {"introduction": "The SCRaMbLE system is a powerful engine for generating vast genetic diversity, but this creates a new challenge: how do we efficiently find the rare cells containing our desired modification within a massive library of variants? This problem moves from post-construction verification to the powerful strategy of genetic selection. You will be tasked with designing an experiment that uses the classic URA3/5-Fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) counter-selection system to actively enrich for yeast cells that have undergone a specific deletion event, a technique that allows scientists to isolate valuable mutants without tedious manual screening [@problem_id:2067028].", "problem": "In synthetic biology, the SCRaMbLE system (Synthetic Chromosome Rearrangement and Modification by LoxP-mediated Evolution) is a powerful tool used in designer yeast chromosomes of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. When activated, it induces random genomic rearrangements, including deletions, between strategically placed loxPsym sites. A common method for selecting desired genetic outcomes is to use a counter-selectable marker like the *URA3* gene. The URA3 protein product is essential for growth on media lacking uracil, but it also converts the non-toxic pro-drug 5-Fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) into a toxic substance, killing the cell.\n\nA synthetic biologist has designed a linear synthetic chromosome containing two large, non-essential genomic regions, termed \"Region A\" and \"Region B\".

Deletion of Region A makes cells URA3-negative. Plating on media lacking uracil plus 5-FOA simultaneously requires URA3 for growth and kills URA3-positive cells. Both URA3-positive and URA3-negative cells fail to grow, so this does not select the desired class.\n- Option B places URA3 in Region B and plates on uracil plus 5-FOA, selecting URA3-negative cells, i.e., those that deleted Region B. This selects against the desired retention of Region B.\n- Option C places URA3 in Region A and plates on uracil plus 5-FOA, selecting URA3-negative cells, which directly correspond to those that deleted Region A. This selection is neutral with respect to Region B; among the provided options, it most directly enriches for the desired Region A deletions.\n- Option D places URA3 in Region B and plates without uracil, selecting URA3-positive cells (Region B present), but it does not select for deletion of Region A, so it does not isolate the desired combination.\n\nTherefore, the strategy that most directly selects for Region A deletions (while not deselecting Region B) is Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2067028"}, {"introduction": "Advanced synthetic biology involves designing circuits with predictable, tunable behaviors. This final practice elevates the challenge from simple construction to quantitative design and analysis. You will encounter a hypothetical self-limiting SCRaMbLE system where the Cre recombinase can excise both its own gene and other target cassettes, creating a competition between different recombination events. By modeling this system, you can predict the average number of modifications a cell will accumulate before the system shuts itself off, providing a powerful lesson in how circuit parameters can be tuned to control the duration and intensity of genomic evolution [@problem_id:2067001].", "problem": "A synthetic yeast strain is designed for controlled, rapid evolution experiments using a self-limiting genetic modification system. The strain carries a single, specially designed synthetic chromosome with the following components:\n\n1.  A Cre recombinase expression cassette. The expression of this enzyme is continuously induced by the growth medium. This entire cassette is flanked by a pair of 'self-destruct' loxP sites of type A, arranged in the same orientation. The presence of Cre enzyme can catalyze the excision of its own expression cassette, a process which permanently halts further Cre production in that cell. The rate of this self-excision event is proportional to the number of Cre molecules in the cell, $N_{Cre}$, and is given by $R_{self} = k_{self} N_{Cre}$, where $k_{self}$ is the self-excision rate constant.\n\n2.  A set of $M$ identical, non-overlapping 'counter' cassettes distributed elsewhere on the synthetic chromosome. These cassettes serve as markers for recombination activity. Each counter cassette is flanked by a pair of loxP sites of type B, also in the same orientation. The rate of excision for any single counter cassette is also proportional to the number of Cre molecules, given by $R_{count} = k_{count} N_{Cre}$, where $k_{count}$ is the counter-excision rate constant for a single cassette.\n\nAll excision events are independent of each other. The time-dependent concentration of Cre recombinase, $N_{Cre}(t)$, is complex, but you may assume that at any given moment, the probability of a specific recombination event occurring is proportional to its instantaneous rate.\n\nYour task is to calculate the expected total number of counter cassettes that will be excised in a single cell, from the moment of induction until the Cre expression cassette is inevitably excised.
