This exercise explores the concept of reverse transcriptase \"processivity\"—the enzyme's ability to copy the RNA template without falling off—which is a critical factor limiting the length of genetic sequences that can be written into the genome. By considering a scenario with a faulty, low-processivity enzyme [@problem_id:2056280], you will develop an intuition for how the physical limitations of molecular machines dictate the outcomes of a gene-editing experiment.", "problem": "In the field of synthetic biology, Prime Editing (PE) is a genome editing technology that enables the direct installation of targeted insertions, deletions, and all 12 possible base-to-base conversions without requiring double-strand breaks or donor DNA templates. The core of the PE machinery is a fusion protein consisting of a Cas9 nickase (an enzyme that cuts only one strand of the DNA) and a Reverse Transcriptase (RT) enzyme. This complex is programmed with a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA), which both specifies the target site in the genome and provides an RNA template for the RT to synthesize the desired edit.\n\nThe processivity of a polymerase, such as an RT, is defined as the average number of nucleotides the enzyme can add to a growing chain before it dissociates from its template. Imagine a researcher designs a PE system to insert a specific 15-nucleotide sequence into a target gene. However, due to an engineering error, the RT fused to the Cas9 nickase has exceptionally low processivity, causing it to dissociate from the pegRNA template after polymerizing an average of only 5 nucleotides.\n\nGiven this scenario, which of the following outcomes is most likely to be observed in a population of cells treated with this faulty Prime Editor?\n\nA. A heterogeneous population of cells containing either the original unedited sequence or various incomplete insertions significantly shorter than 15 nucleotides.\n\nB. The desired 15-nucleotide sequence is successfully inserted at high efficiency.\n\nC. A deletion of approximately 15 nucleotides occurs at the target site.\n\nD. The target DNA sequence remains completely unchanged across all cells, as the edit is aborted before it can begin.\n\nE. The Cas9-RT fusion protein causes random insertions and deletions at numerous off-target sites throughout the genome.", "solution": "1. Define processivity as the mean number of nucleotides added per binding event of a polymerase before dissociation. Denote the processivity by $P$ and the required insertion length by $L$. In this scenario, $P=5$ nucleotides and $L=15$ nucleotides, so $P<L$.\n\n2. In Prime Editing, the Cas9 nickase creates a single-strand nick at the target, and the reverse transcriptase (RT) uses the pegRNA template to synthesize a DNA extension (the edit) that forms a 3-prime flap. Successful installation of the full intended insertion requires the RT to polymerize the entire $L=15$ nucleotides from the pegRNA template before dissociation.\n\n3. Because $P=5$ is substantially smaller than $L=15$, the RT will, on average, dissociate after synthesizing about 5 nucleotides. This implies the probability of completing the full 15-nucleotide synthesis is low, while partial synthesis events of various lengths shorter than 15 nucleotides are common.\n\n4. The resolution of the 3-prime flap by cellular repair pathways can capture whatever length has been synthesized at the moment of RT dissociation. Therefore, edits that do occur will often represent incomplete insertions with a distribution of lengths less than 15 nucleotides. Some alleles will remain unedited when synthesis is too short or not stabilized.\n\n5. Option B is unlikely because high-efficiency full 15-nucleotide insertions require $P\\geq L$, which is not met. Option C is not expected because a deletion of approximately 15 nucleotides is not the typical outcome of premature RT dissociation in PE without a design specifically directing a deletion. Option D is incorrect because initiation of synthesis does occur, leading to some partial insertions rather than universally no change. Option E is unlikely because PE avoids double-strand breaks, and a low-processivity RT does not by itself cause random genome-wide insertions or deletions.\n\n6. Therefore, the most likely observed outcome is a heterogeneous population with a mix of unedited alleles and various incomplete, shorter-than-15-nucleotide insertions.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2056280"}, {"introduction": "After performing a gene editing experiment, the crucial next step is to verify the result at the DNA level. This practice exercise simulates a common and fundamental validation workflow: analyzing Sanger sequencing data from a clonal cell population to determine the precise genetic outcome. This problem [@problem_id:2056300] will help you connect the abstract concepts of homozygous and heterozygous edits to the concrete interpretation of sequencing chromatograms, a vital skill for any molecular biologist.", "problem": "A team of researchers is using prime editing, a precision gene-editing technique, to correct the mutation responsible for sickle cell anemia in a human cell line. The disease is caused by a single point mutation in the beta-globin (HBB) gene. In the context of this experiment, we can simplify the genetics to a single nucleotide position. The wild-type (healthy) allele contains an adenine (A) at this position, while the sickle-cell (disease) allele contains a thymine (T).\n\nThe researchers started with a cell line that was homozygous for the disease allele (genotype T/T). After applying the prime editor designed to convert the T back to an A, they isolated a single cell and grew it into a large, clonal population. To verify the outcome of the edit in this clone, they performed the following procedure:\n1.  Genomic DNA was extracted from the clonal cell population.\n2.  The region of the HBB gene containing the target nucleotide was amplified using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).\n3.  The resulting PCR product was analyzed by Sanger sequencing.\n\nIn Sanger sequencing analysis, the relative abundance of each nucleotide at a specific position in the DNA sample is reflected in the height of its corresponding fluorescent peak in the chromatogram. For a homozygous position (e.g., A/A or T/T), a single, full-height peak is observed, which is calibrated to a reference height of 100 arbitrary units. At the target nucleotide position in their sample, the researchers observed a peak for adenine (A) with a height of 48 units and a peak for thymine (T) with a height of 51 units.\n\nBased on this sequencing data, what is the genotype of the cells in the clonal population at the target locus?\n\nA. Homozygous for the corrected wild-type allele (A/A)\n\nB. Heterozygous, with one corrected wild-type allele and one uncorrected disease allele (A/T)\n\nC. Homozygous for the uncorrected disease allele (T/T)\n\nD. The population is a mosaic, containing a mixture of A/A, A/T, and T/T cells.\n\nE. The prime editing experiment failed and caused a large deletion at the target site.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the genotype of a clonal cell population after a prime editing experiment, using Sanger sequencing data.\n\nFirst, let's understand the experimental setup and the possible outcomes. The starting cell line is homozygous for the disease allele, which we denote as T/T. The prime editor is designed to change the T allele to the wild-type A allele. The experiment involves isolating a single cell after the editing process and expanding it into a clonal population. This means every cell in the final population has the exact same genotype as that original, single, post-editing cell.\n\nThere are three possible genotypes for this founding cell at the target locus:\n1.  **Homozygous corrected (A/A):** The prime editor successfully converted the T to an A on both homologous chromosomes.\n2.  **Heterozygous (A/T):** The prime editor successfully converted the T to an A on only one of the two homologous chromosomes.\n3.  **Homozygous uncorrected (T/T):** The prime editor failed to convert the T on either chromosome.\n\nNext, we need to predict the Sanger sequencing result for each of these three possible genotypes. The DNA from the clonal population is amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). This process creates many copies of the target DNA region from the cells' genomes. The pool of PCR products is then sequenced.\n\nThe problem states that the height of a sequencing peak is proportional to the nucleotide's prevalence in the sample, with a homozygous base pair giving a peak height of approximately 100 units.\n\n-   **If the genotype is A/A (homozygous corrected):** All the amplified DNA will have an 'A' at the target position. The Sanger sequencing result should show a strong 'A' peak with a height of approximately 100 units, and a negligible 'T' peak (close to 0 units).\n\n-   **If the genotype is T/T (homozygous uncorrected):** All the amplified DNA will have a 'T' at the target position. The sequencing result should show a strong 'T' peak with a height of approximately 100 units, and a negligible 'A' peak.\n\n-   **If the genotype is A/T (heterozygous):** The cell's genome contains one 'A' allele and one 'T' allele. PCR will amplify both alleles. The resulting pool of PCR products will be an approximately 50/50 mixture of DNA containing 'A' and DNA containing 'T' at the target position. Therefore, the Sanger sequencing should detect both bases. The 'A' peak height would be approximately $0.5 \\times 100 = 50$ units, and the 'T' peak height would also be approximately $0.5 \\times 100 = 50$ units.\n\nNow, let's compare these predictions with the experimental data provided:\n-   Observed 'A' peak height = 48 units.\n-   Observed 'T' peak height = 51 units.\n\nThese observed values (48 and 51) are very close to the 50/50 split predicted for a heterozygous genotype. The total signal (48 + 51 = 99 units) is also consistent with the calibrated full height of 100 units.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the given options:\n-   A. Homozygous for the corrected wild-type allele (A/A): This is inconsistent with the data, as it would produce an 'A' peak of ~100 and a 'T' peak of ~0.\n-   B. Heterozygous, with one corrected wild-type allele and one uncorrected disease allele (A/T): This is highly consistent with the data, which shows two peaks of approximately half-height.\n-   C. Homozygous for the uncorrected disease allele (T/T): This is inconsistent with the data, as it would produce a 'T' peak of ~100 and an 'A' peak of ~0.\n-   D. The population is a mosaic: This is incorrect. The problem specifies that the population is clonal, meaning it originated from a single cell. All cells are genetically identical. A mosaic population would yield similar sequencing data, but it contradicts the stated experimental design. The data perfectly fits the simpler explanation of a uniformly heterozygous clonal population.\n-   E. The prime editing experiment failed and caused a large deletion: This is inconsistent with the data. A deletion would cause a frameshift in the sequencing read, leading to noisy and uninterpretable signal downstream of the deletion site. The presence of two clear, quantifiable peaks at the target position indicates that the sequence integrity is maintained at that locus.\n\nTherefore, the sequencing data indicates that the clonal population is heterozygous (A/T).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2056300"}, {"introduction": "While verifying a single clone is informative, most gene editing experiments require assessing the outcomes across an entire population of cells, revealing a mixture of intended edits, unedited cells, and unwanted byproducts.

The PE3 system utilizes a prime editor protein guided by a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) to nick the target DNA strand and reverse transcribe the desired edit. Crucially, the PE3 strategy also employs a second, standard single-guide RNA (sgRNA) to introduce another nick on the opposite, unedited strand nearby. This second nick is intended to bias the cell's repair machinery towards incorporating the edit. However, incorrect repair of this second nick can lead to unwanted insertions or deletions (indels).\n\nAfter the experiment, the researchers perform targeted deep sequencing, a form of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), on the edited cell population to assess the outcomes at the target locus.
