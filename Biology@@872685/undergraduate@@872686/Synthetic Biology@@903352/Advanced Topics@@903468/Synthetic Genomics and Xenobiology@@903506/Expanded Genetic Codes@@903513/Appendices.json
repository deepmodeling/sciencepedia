Their goal is to evolve a tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase from the archaeon *Methanocaldococcus jannaschii* (MjTyrRS) to charge the ncAA *p*-azido-L-phenylalanine (pAzF) instead of its natural substrate, tyrosine.\n\nThe researchers use a directed evolution strategy. First, they create a large library of MjTyrRS gene variants. This library is then transformed into a specialized *E. coli* strain. This host strain is engineered to express an orthogonal tRNA (tRNA_CUA), which is the cognate partner for MjTyrRS, and a reporter gene for chloramphenicol resistance. Crucially, the chloramphenicol resistance gene has been modified to contain an in-frame amber stop codon (UAG) at a position that is essential for the protein's function.\n\nFor the selection step, the transformed *E. coli* cells are plated on a solid growth medium that contains both the antibiotic chloramphenicol and the non-canonical amino acid pAzF. Only a small fraction of the transformed cells are observed to grow into colonies.\n\nWhat is the primary purpose of this selection step in the experiment?\n\nA. To identify and isolate MjTyrRS variants that successfully charge pAzF onto the tRNA_CUA, thereby enabling the synthesis of a full-length, functional chloramphenicol resistance protein.\n\nB. To eliminate MjTyrRS variants that incorrectly charge one of the 20 canonical amino acids onto the tRNA_CUA, which would lead to the synthesis of a misfolded and non-functional protein.\n\nC.

To precisely quantify the enzymatic activity of each MjTyrRS variant towards the unnatural amino acid pAzF.", "solution": "The experimental logic relies on amber suppression using an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair. The host cell contains:\n- An orthogonal tRNA with anticodon CUA that can decode the amber codon UAG only if it is aminoacylated.\n- A reporter gene for chloramphenicol resistance containing an in-frame UAG at an essential position; without suppression, translation terminates prematurely and the protein is nonfunctional, so cells cannot grow in chloramphenicol.\n- A library of MjTyrRS variants intended to charge the orthogonal tRNA with the unnatural amino acid p-azido-L-phenylalanine (pAzF).\n\nOn plates containing chloramphenicol and pAzF, survival requires successful amber suppression at the essential UAG site. This occurs if and only if an MjTyrRS variant specifically recognizes pAzF and charges it onto the orthogonal tRNA, enabling insertion of pAzF at UAG and synthesis of the full-length, functional chloramphenicol resistance protein. Most variants do not accomplish this and the corresponding cells fail to grow.\n\nTherefore, the primary purpose of the selection is positive selection for aaRS variants that efficiently aminoacylate the orthogonal tRNA with pAzF to restore reporter function. Evaluating the options:\n- A correctly describes this positive selection outcome.\n- B pertains to negative selection against mischarging with canonical amino acids, which would typically require a different selective setup (e.g., a toxic gene under amber control) and is not the primary purpose of plating on chloramphenicol plus pAzF.\n- C describes library creation, which occurs before the selection step.\n- D concerns orthogonality validation, which is not the function of this selection plate.\n- E implies precise quantitation of enzymatic activity, whereas this selection is qualitative/threshold-based (growth vs. no growth), not a precise kinetic assay.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2037019"}, {"introduction": "Once an orthogonal translation system is implemented, it is essential to verify that the target ncAA has been successfully incorporated into the protein of interest.

The chemical interconversion expected for an aryl azide to an aniline under reducing conditions is the reductive loss of dinitrogen with protonation:\n$$ \\text{Ar-N}_3 + 2\\text{H}^+ + 2\\text{e}^- \\rightarrow \\text{Ar-NH}_2 + \\text{N}_2. $$\nThe mass change associated with this transformation, considering only the substituent conversion on the aromatic ring, is\n$$ \\Delta m \\equiv m(\\text{Ar-NH}_2) - m(\\text{Ar-N}_3) = (M_{\\text{N}} + 2M_{\\text{H}}) - (3M_{\\text{N}}) = 2M_{\\text{H}} - 2M_{\\text{N}}, $$\nwhich is negative and numerically matches the reported decrease (release of $\\text{N}_2$ and net gain of two hydrogens), consistent with an azide-to-amine reduction.\n\nWe now evaluate the mechanistic options:\n\n- Option A (spontaneous acid-catalyzed hydrolysis in a slightly acidic cytoplasm) is implausible because the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli is maintained near neutral pH by homeostatic mechanisms, and aryl azides are not hydrolyzed to anilines under such conditions. Moreover, hydrolysis does not account for the stoichiometric loss of $\\text{N}_2$ and the specific mass decrease $2M_{\\text{N}} - 2M_{\\text{H}}$.\n\n- Option B (oxidation by reactive oxygen species) would not yield an amine. Oxidation of an azide is more likely to produce nitrenium-type intermediates or higher oxidation-state nitrogen species, not the two-electron reduced aniline. Oxidation also cannot explain the characteristic loss of $\\text{N}_2$ and the observed mass decrease.\n\n- Option C (kinase phosphorylation of the terminal nitrogen followed by substitution with ammonia) is chemically implausible. Native kinases do not target aryl azides; the azide nitrogen is a poor nucleophile under physiological conditions, and such a two-step process is not consistent with known cellular chemistry. It also does not furnish the required dinitrogen extrusion.\n\n- Option E (transaminase mistaking an azide for a ketone) is mechanistically inconsistent. Transaminases act on carbonyl substrates via Schiff-base chemistry and do not operate on aryl azides or phenyl rings in this manner.\n\n- Option D (reduction by endogenous intracellular reducing agents) directly matches the required two-electron, two-proton reduction with loss of $\\text{N}_2$, as summarized above. In Escherichia coli, multiple reducing systems can mediate or enable such net reductions: low-molecular-weight thiols (e.g., glutathione) and protein systems such as thioredoxin and glutaredoxin maintain a reducing intracellular redox potential, and flavin-dependent reductases (e.g., nitroreductases/azoreductases using NAD(P)H) are known to reduce diverse nitrogen-containing functionalities, including aryl azides, to anilines in vivo.
