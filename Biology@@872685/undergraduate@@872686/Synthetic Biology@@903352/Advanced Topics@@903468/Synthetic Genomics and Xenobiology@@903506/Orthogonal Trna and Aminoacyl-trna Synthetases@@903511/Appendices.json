This requires the co-expression of an orthogonal pair: a unique aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) that charges the non-canonical amino acid, and its corresponding orthogonal transfer RNA (tRNA). Both genes are to be placed on a single plasmid for stable maintenance and expression in the bacterial host. The plasmid backbone already contains a necessary origin of replication (`ori`) and an antibiotic resistance marker.\n\nYou are provided with the following genetic parts to construct the expression cassettes:\n*   `P_const`: A strong, constitutive bacterial promoter that initiates transcription.\n*   `RBS`: A ribosome binding site, required for initiating translation in prokaryotes.\n*   `CDS_aaRS`: The protein-coding sequence for the orthogonal aaRS.\n*   `Gene_tRNA`: The gene sequence that is transcribed into the functional orthogonal tRNA.\n*   `T`: A rho-independent transcriptional terminator.\n\nAssuming the most standard and efficient design for robust expression of both components, which of the following linear arrangements correctly represents the genetic cassettes required on the plasmid?

A protein-coding gene requires a transcriptional promoter to recruit RNA polymerase, a ribosome binding site (RBS) to recruit the ribosome for translation initiation, the coding sequence, and a transcriptional terminator to ensure proper termination; the canonical architecture is therefore promoter followed by RBS, coding sequence, and terminator. In contrast, a tRNA is a non-coding RNA that is transcribed but not translated; it therefore requires a promoter and terminator for transcription, but it must not include an RBS because an RBS is only used for translation of mRNA into protein and is inappropriate for tRNA expression. For robust and modular control, the aaRS and tRNA are typically placed in separate expression cassettes on the same plasmid, each with its own promoter and terminator.\n\nEvaluate each option against these rules. Option A places an RBS upstream of the tRNA gene, which is incorrect because tRNA is not translated and does not require or use an RBS; including an RBS is unnecessary and non-standard. Option B provides the aaRS cassette as promoter, RBS, coding sequence, and terminator, and provides the tRNA cassette as promoter, tRNA gene, and terminator; this matches the standard and efficient design for expressing a protein-coding gene and a non-coding tRNA gene in bacteria. Option C omits the RBS for the aaRS, which would prevent efficient translation initiation of the aaRS and is therefore incorrect. Option D lacks a promoter for the tRNA gene, which would prevent transcription of the tRNA and is therefore incorrect. Option E places both elements in a single operon with one promoter and one RBS upstream of the aaRS, directly followed by the tRNA gene and a single terminator. This is non-standard for reliable tRNA expression because the tRNA should be transcribed as a functional RNA with its own promoter and processing context, not embedded downstream of a protein-coding sequence in a polycistronic mRNA architecture lacking a dedicated tRNA promoter; such an arrangement risks improper transcriptional control and RNA processing for the tRNA.\n\nTherefore, the correct and most standard arrangement is separate cassettes with promoter-RBS-coding-terminator for the aaRS and promoter-gene-terminator for the tRNA, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2053848"}, {"introduction": "With a valid design in hand, the next challenge is to find a synthetase that actually performs its new function. This exercise introduces the powerful concept of positive selection, a core technique in synthetic biology used to discover rare, functional proteins from vast libraries of non-functional variants. You will devise a \"life-or-death\" test where only cells containing a working orthogonal system can survive, illustrating how we can efficiently screen for desired biological activities. [@problem_id:2053840]", "problem": "A synthetic biology research team aims to create an *E. coli* strain capable of incorporating a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) into its proteins. To achieve this, they need to identify a functional orthogonal pair, which consists of an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) and its cognate transfer RNA (tRNA) that work independently of the host cell's own machinery.\n\nThe experimental setup is as follows:\n1.  A host *E. coli* strain is engineered to express a specific orthogonal tRNA (o-tRNA). This o-tRNA has an anticodon that recognizes the amber stop codon (UAG) but is not recognized by any of the native *E. coli* synthetases.\n2.  This host strain also carries a plasmid containing the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), an enzyme that confers resistance to the antibiotic chloramphenicol. However, the CAT gene has been modified to include an in-frame UAG stop codon at a position essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity.\n3.  The researchers have created a large library of mutant aaRS genes. They plan to transform this library into the host *E. coli* strain. The goal is to find a mutant aaRS that can specifically charge the o-tRNA with the desired ncAA.\n\nTo find the rare cells containing a functional mutant aaRS from the library, the researchers will plate the transformed *E. coli* on a solid growth medium.

A minimal growth medium supplemented with both chloramphenicol and all 20 standard amino acids, but not the ncAA.", "solution": "The goal of this experiment is to perform a positive selection for *E. coli* cells that contain a functional orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS). A functional aaRS, in this context, is one that can recognize the orthogonal tRNA (o-tRNA) and charge it with the non-canonical amino acid (ncAA).\n\nLet's analyze the genetic circuit. The cells contain a gene for chloramphenicol resistance (CAT) that is rendered non-functional by a premature amber stop codon (UAG). For a cell to survive in the presence of chloramphenicol, it must produce a full-length, functional CAT protein. This can only happen if the ribosome is able to \"read through\" the UAG stop codon.\n\nThe mechanism for this read-through is the orthogonal system. The o-tRNA is designed to recognize the UAG codon. If a functional aaRS from the transformed library is present, it will attach the ncAA (supplied in the medium) to the o-tRNA. When the ribosome encounters the UAG codon in the CAT messenger RNA, this charged o-tRNA will bind to it and insert the ncAA into the growing polypeptide chain. This allows translation to continue, producing the full-length CAT protein and conferring antibiotic resistance.\n\nNow, we evaluate the media options based on this mechanism:\n\n- **A. A minimal growth medium supplemented only with the ncAA:** In this medium, cells with a functional aaRS might incorporate the ncAA, but there is no selective pressure. Cells with non-functional aaRS mutants will grow just as well as those with functional ones, because there is no chloramphenicol to kill them. Therefore, this medium does not select for the desired phenotype.\n\n- **B. A minimal growth medium supplemented with both chloramphenicol and the ncAA:** This condition provides both the necessary components for the selection to work. The chloramphenicol acts as the selective agent, killing any cell that cannot produce functional CAT protein. The ncAA is the substrate required by a functional orthogonal system to suppress the stop codon. Only cells that possess a functional aaRS from the library can use the provided ncAA to charge the o-tRNA, suppress the UAG codon, produce full-length CAT, and thus survive and form a colony. This is the correct condition for positive selection.\n\n- **C. A minimal growth medium supplemented only with chloramphenicol:** In this medium, the selective pressure (chloramphenicol) is present. However, the substrate (ncAA) for the orthogonal system is absent. Even if a cell contains a perfectly functional aaRS, there is no ncAA for it to attach to the o-tRNA. Consequently, stop-codon suppression cannot occur, no functional CAT is produced, and all cells will die.\n\n- **D. A rich growth medium (containing all 20 standard amino acids) with no supplements:** This is a non-selective medium. All cells, regardless of the functionality of the aaRS they contain, will grow. There is no selection.\n\n- **E. A minimal growth medium supplemented with both chloramphenicol and all 20 standard amino acids, but not the ncAA:** This is similar to option C. The selective pressure (chloramphenicol) is present. However, the crucial ncAA is missing. Since the o-tRNA and o-aaRS are designed to be orthogonal, they should not interact with any of the 20 standard amino acids. Therefore, no stop codon suppression will occur, and all cells will die.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only medium that provides both the challenge (antibiotic) and the unique solution (ncAA) is the one described in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2053840"}, {"introduction": "A functional synthetase is useful, but a truly *orthogonal* one is essential for clean and reliable genetic code expansion.

A critical step is to evolve an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) that specifically charges its cognate orthogonal transfer RNA (tRNA) and does not cross-react with any of the host cell's endogenous tRNAs.\n\nTo achieve this, a negative selection strategy is employed. A library of *E. coli* cells is transformed, where each cell expresses a unique variant of the engineered aaRS. The library of cells contains two populations of these variants: \"desired\" variants, which are perfectly orthogonal, and \"undesired\" variants, which mistakenly charge an endogenous tRNA ($tRNA^{Gln}$) with the canonical amino acid glutamine.\n\nAll cells in the library also contain a plasmid encoding the toxic protein *ccdB*. The *ccdB* gene has been modified to include an in-frame amber stop codon (UAG). The experiment is conducted in a growth medium that completely lacks the ncAA. In this setup, if an \"undesired\" aaRS variant charges the endogenous $tRNA^{Gln}$, this mis-charged tRNA can act as a nonsense suppressor, reading through the UAG codon.
