The Michaelis constant is defined by\n$$\nK_{M}=\\frac{k_{-1}+k_{cat}}{k_{1}},\n$$\nwhere $k_{1}$ is the bimolecular association rate for $E+S \\to ES$, $k_{-1}$ is the dissociation rate for $ES \\to E+S$, and $k_{cat}$ is the catalytic turnover rate for $ES \\to E+P$. When $k_{cat} \\ll k_{-1}$ (the rapid equilibrium or weakly catalytic limit), one has\n$$\nK_{M} \\approx \\frac{k_{-1}}{k_{1}}=K_{D},\n$$\nthe equilibrium dissociation constant of the $ES$ complex. Thus, a high measured $K_{M}$ indicates weak binding, i.e., a large $K_{D}$, and the direct route to lowering $K_{M}$ is to strengthen $ES$ binding (reduce $K_{D}$).\n\nBinding affinity is thermodynamically related to the binding free energy. For $E+S \\rightleftharpoons ES$, the association constant is $K_{a}=1/K_{D}$ and\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}=-RT\\ln K_{a}=RT\\ln K_{D}.\n$$\nTherefore, reducing $K_{D}$ (and hence, under the stated kinetic regime, $K_{M}$) corresponds to making $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$ more negative. Rational design should therefore target mutations that make substrate binding more favorable (more negative predicted binding energy) specifically in the binding site.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A proposes an in silico single-point mutational scan of residues lining the predicted active site and, for each variant, docking Substrate P to estimate binding energy. This directly targets $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$ and, under $K_{M} \\approx K_{D}$, is the most direct computational approach to lower $K_{M}$ by improving ES affinity. It is rational and focused on the binding interface responsible for $K_{D}$.\n- Option B targets global thermodynamic stability (folding free energy), which may improve expression or robustness but does not directly improve $ES$ binding affinity and thus is not the most direct way to lower $K_{M}$.\n- Option C alters the substrate rather than the enzyme; given the pollutant is fixed in the environment, this is not aligned with the stated goal of engineering the enzyme.\n- Option D changes expression yield, not the kinetic parameter $K_{M}$; it does not alter binding affinity per enzyme molecule.\n- Option E simulates the apoenzyme without substrate, which does not directly evaluate or improve $ES$ binding; if anything, one would need ligand-bound simulations or binding free energy calculations.
