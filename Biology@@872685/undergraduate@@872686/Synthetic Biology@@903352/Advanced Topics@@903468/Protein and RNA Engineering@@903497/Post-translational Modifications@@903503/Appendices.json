The first step is proteolytic cleavage of an N-terminal signal peptide, and the second is phosphorylation.\n\nUsing high-resolution mass spectrometry, the mass of the inactive Pro-Regulin is measured. The protein is then treated with a specific protease that cleaves off the N-terminal dipeptide, Glycyl-Alanine (Gly-Ala). Following this cleavage, the protein is incubated in a solution containing a specific protein kinase and an excess of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), leading to phosphorylation. The mass of the final, fully modified protein is then measured again.\n\nBiochemically, phosphorylation of a protein at a serine, threonine, or tyrosine residue involves a reaction with ATP.
