Through structural analysis and previous experiments, they have identified that a serine residue at position 94 (Ser-94) is a critical component of the enzyme's catalytic active site, acting as the primary nucleophile during the cleavage of the peptide bond. A researcher decides to perform site-directed mutagenesis to replace this Ser-94 with an alanine residue (Ala). Which of the following is the most likely and direct functional consequence of this Ser94Ala mutation?\n\nA. The protein will fail to fold into its correct three-dimensional structure and will be degraded by the cell.\n\nB. The enzyme's catalytic activity will be severely diminished or completely abolished, while its overall structure and substrate binding ability remain largely intact.\n\nC. The mutation will cause the enzyme to bind to its substrate with much higher affinity, effectively trapping the substrate in the active site.\n\nD. The enzyme will switch its substrate specificity to cleave a different type of peptide bond.\n\nE. The mutation will significantly increase the enzyme's optimal operating temperature.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most likely functional consequence of mutating a catalytic serine to an alanine in a protease. To determine this, we must analyze the chemical properties of both amino acids and their roles within the enzyme's active site.\n\n1.  **Analyze the original residue: Serine (Ser)**\n    The side chain of serine is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). The crucial feature of this side chain is the terminal hydroxyl (-OH) group. This group is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding. More importantly, in the context of a serine protease active site, the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group is a potent nucleophile. The problem statement explicitly confirms this, stating Ser-94 \"act[s] as the primary nucleophile during the cleavage of the peptide bond.\" This nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the substrate's peptide bond is the essential first step of the catalytic mechanism.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mutant residue: Alanine (Ala)**\n    The side chain of alanine is a simple methyl group (-CH3). This group is small, non-polar (hydrophobic), and chemically inert. It cannot act as a nucleophile, nor can it participate in hydrogen bonding as a donor or acceptor.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the consequences of the mutation (Ser94Ala)**\n\n    *   **Effect on Catalysis:** The core function of Ser-94 is to provide the nucleophilic hydroxyl group necessary for catalysis. By replacing serine with alanine, this essential functional group is removed and substituted with a non-reactive methyl group. Without the nucleophile, the chemical reaction (peptide bond cleavage) cannot be initiated. Therefore, the enzyme's catalytic activity will be drastically reduced, likely to a negligible level or completely abolished.\n\n    *   **Effect on Protein Structure and Folding:** Alanine is a small amino acid, even smaller than serine. The substitution of serine with alanine is considered a relatively conservative change in terms of steric bulk. While it changes the local chemical environment from polar to non-polar, a single mutation of this type on the surface of a protein or in an active site cleft is highly unlikely to disrupt the global three-dimensional fold of the entire protein. We would expect the overall structure to remain largely intact. This makes option A incorrect.\n\n    *   **Effect on Substrate Binding:** An enzyme's active site typically has residues for substrate binding (which confer specificity) and residues for catalysis. The problem identifies Ser-94 as a *catalytic* residue. While it is part of the active site, its primary role is not substrate recognition. The substrate would likely still be able to bind to the active site pocket, which is formed by other residues. However, once bound, the catalytic step cannot proceed. Therefore, the mutation is unlikely to prevent binding or significantly increase binding affinity (trapping the substrate). This makes options C and D incorrect. Option D, a change in specificity, would typically require more substantial changes in the binding pocket, not just the removal of a catalytic group.\n\n    *   **Effect on Stability:** While mutations can affect protein stability (e.g., thermal stability), it is not the most direct or primary *functional* consequence of removing a key catalytic residue. The primary function of a protease is catalysis, and the most certain outcome of removing the catalytic machinery is the loss of that function. Thus, option E is not the best description of the outcome.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    The most direct and certain consequence of replacing the catalytic nucleophile (Ser-94) with a non-reactive group (Ala) is the loss of catalytic function. The overall protein structure and its ability to bind the substrate are expected to be largely unaffected. This corresponds precisely with option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2045919"}, {"introduction": "Once a desirable mutation is identified through rational design, the next step is to implement it at the genetic level.
