This exercise [@problem_id:1468325] challenges you to predict the outcome of skipping an exon whose length is not a multiple of three. Understanding this principle is crucial for designing synthetic genes and interpreting the functional consequences of natural splicing variations, as it highlights the critical difference between an in-frame deletion and a catastrophic frameshift mutation.", "problem": "In a particular line of eukaryotic cells, a gene responsible for producing a cytoskeletal protein called \"Structrin\" is actively transcribed. The initial transcript, or pre-messenger Ribonucleic Acid (pre-mRNA), contains five exons. In most cell types, all five exons are spliced together to produce a functional mRNA sequence. However, in response to a specific signaling molecule, a specialized splicing factor causes Exon 4 to be excluded from the final mature mRNA transcript. This alternatively spliced mRNA is then translated into a variant of the Structrin protein. The length of Exon 4 is exactly 50 nucleotides.\n\nAssuming that the splicing of Exon 3 to Exon 5 is successful and does not introduce or remove any additional nucleotides at the splice junction, which of the following statements describes the most direct and certain consequence for the reading frame of the mature mRNA?\n\nA. The reading frame will be preserved, but the resulting protein will be shorter by 16 amino acids.\n\nB. The reading frame will be shifted for all codons downstream of the splice junction.\n\nC. The reading frame will be unaffected because the ribosome can skip over the altered splice junction.\n\nD. Splicing will be completely blocked, as exons that are not a multiple of three nucleotides in length cannot be removed.\n\nE. The reading frame will be preserved, but the resulting protein will be shorter by 17 amino acids.", "solution": "The central principle required to solve this problem is the nature of the genetic code and the concept of a reading frame. The genetic code is a triplet code, meaning that the sequence of nucleotides in a messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) molecule is read by the ribosome in successive, non-overlapping groups of three. Each group of three nucleotides is called a codon, and it specifies a particular amino acid (or a stop signal).\n\nThe reading frame is the specific way in which the sequence of nucleotides is partitioned into codons. A continuous coding sequence is established when the ribosome initiates translation at a start codon (usually AUG) and reads in triplets from that point onwards.\n\nIn this problem, a gene's pre-mRNA is processed. The process of splicing removes introns and joins exons together to form the mature mRNA. In the standard case, all five exons are joined, creating a continuous reading frame. In the case of alternative splicing described, Exon 4 is skipped. This means that Exon 3 is ligated directly to Exon 5.\n\nThe length of the skipped Exon 4 is 50 nucleotides. For the reading frame to be maintained across the new splice junction (between Exon 3 and Exon 5), the number of nucleotides removed must be an integer multiple of 3. If a multiple of 3 nucleotides is removed, an integer number of codons is removed, and the reading frame downstream of the deletion remains aligned as before.\n\nLet's analyze the number of nucleotides removed: 50. We check if 50 is a multiple of 3.\n$$\n\\frac{50}{3} = 16.666...\n$$\nSince 50 is not an integer multiple of 3, removing this exon will cause a frameshift mutation. After Exon 3, the ribosome will continue reading in triplets, but because 50 nucleotides are missing, the grouping of nucleotides into codons will be shifted. For example, if the original sequence was `...AAA GGG CCC TTT...` where `AAA` is the last codon in Exon 3 and `GGG` is the first codon in Exon 4, and let's say after 50 nucleotides the sequence at the start of Exon 5 is `UUU`, the new sequence becomes `...AAA UUU...`. However, the shift is more complex. The removal of 50 nucleotides means the removal of 16 full codons and 2 extra nucleotides ($50 = 16 \\times 3 + 2$). This 2-nucleotide deficit will cause all subsequent codons to be read out of frame. This altered sequence of codons will almost certainly code for a completely different sequence of amino acids. Furthermore, a frameshift mutation very often introduces a premature stop codon, leading to the synthesis of a truncated and non-functional protein.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\nA. This option claims the reading frame is preserved. This is incorrect, as 50 is not a multiple of 3. The calculation of 16 amino acids comes from $50 \\div 3 \\approx 16$, which ignores the remainder and its effect on the reading frame.\n\nB. This option correctly states that the reading frame will be shifted for all codons downstream of the splice junction. This is the direct and unavoidable consequence of deleting a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of 3.\n\nC. This option suggests the ribosome can compensate for the change. Ribosomes do not have such a mechanism; they slavishly read the mRNA in triplets from the start codon. They cannot \"skip over\" or correct a frameshift in the mRNA template.\n\nD. This option claims splicing is blocked. This is incorrect. The splicing machinery recognizes specific sequences at the exon-intron boundaries (splice donor and acceptor sites), not the length of the exon in relation to the genetic code. Alternative splicing is a regulated process that allows for the skipping of exons regardless of their length.\n\nE. This option, like A, incorrectly claims the reading frame is preserved. The calculation of 17 amino acids is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and certain consequence is a shift in the reading frame.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1468325"}, {"introduction": "The precise removal of introns is not magic; it is a highly orchestrated chemical reaction catalyzed by the spliceosome. This problem [@problem_id:2018385] asks you to diagnose the failure of a synthetic gene by considering the deletion of a single, crucial nucleotide—the branch point adenosine. This practice deepens your understanding of the core splicing mechanism and the importance of specific sequence motifs in guiding the spliceosome's function.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology project, you have designed a minimal eukaryotic gene construct intended for expression in yeast. The construct consists of a promoter, Exon 1, Intron A, Exon 2, and a polyadenylation signal. The proper function of the resulting protein relies on the precise removal of Intron A and the ligation of Exon 1 to Exon 2. However, a synthesis error occurs, and your final DNA construct contains a version of Intron A where the crucial branch point adenosine nucleotide has been deleted. All other consensus sequences required for splicing, such as the 5' and 3' splice sites, remain perfectly intact.\n\nAssuming this mutated gene is transcribed into a pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) and enters the standard nuclear splicing pathway, what is the most likely composition of the final, processed messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript that is exported to the cytoplasm for translation?\n\nA. Splicing will proceed normally, and a functional mRNA consisting of Exon 1 ligated to Exon 2 will be produced.\n\nB. The intron will be successfully excised, but the two exons will fail to ligate, resulting in two separate, short mRNA fragments corresponding to Exon 1 and Exon 2.\n\nC. The intron will be retained in the final mRNA transcript, resulting in a single, long transcript containing Exon 1, Intron A, and Exon 2.\n\nD. The spliceosome will utilize a random adenosine nucleotide near the original branch point as a cryptic branch point, leading to a slightly shorter, non-functional protein.\n\nE. Both Exon 1 and Exon 2 will be degraded, and only the unprocessed Intron A will be exported from the nucleus.", "solution": "Pre-mRNA splicing in eukaryotes proceeds through two sequential transesterification reactions catalyzed by the spliceosome. The critical elements include the 5' splice site at the exon-intron junction, the branch point adenosine within the intron, and the 3' splice site at the intron-exon junction. In the first transesterification, the 2'-hydroxyl of the branch point adenosine performs a nucleophilic attack on the phosphate at the 5' splice site, forming a lariat intermediate with a 2'-5' phosphodiester bond and releasing Exon 1 with a free 3'-hydroxyl. In the second transesterification, the 3'-hydroxyl of Exon 1 attacks the phosphate at the 3' splice site, ligating Exon 1 to Exon 2 and releasing the lariat intron.\n\nDeletion of the branch point adenosine removes the essential nucleophile for the first transesterification. Without this adenosine, the spliceosome cannot form the lariat intermediate, and the first step stalls. Because exon ligation (the second transesterification) depends on completion of the first, exon ligation cannot occur in this scenario. While the 5' and 3' splice sites are intact, they are insufficient to drive catalysis without the branch point adenosine.\n\nUse of a cryptic branch site is context dependent and in yeast the branch point consensus is stringent, typically requiring the designated branch adenosine. Deletion of the crucial branch adenosine therefore most commonly results in failure of splicing and retention of the intron within the transcript. Although such defective pre-mRNAs are often retained in the nucleus or degraded by quality control pathways, the question specifies the most likely composition of the final processed mRNA exported for translation. The transcript that escapes surveillance would retain Intron A between Exon 1 and Exon 2.\n\nThus, the most likely exported mRNA contains Exon 1, Intron A, and Exon 2, corresponding to intron retention.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2018385"}, {"introduction": "In synthetic biology, it's not enough to know that splicing can be regulated; we must be able to measure and quantify it precisely.

The minigene consists of three exons (E1, E2, E3) separated by two introns. Exon E2 is a cassette exon, meaning it can either be included in the mature mRNA (forming an E1-E2-E3 transcript) or skipped (forming an E1-E3 transcript).\n\nTwo versions of this reporter plasmid are created:\n1.  **Control Plasmid:** The standard minigene with the natural sequence of exon E2.\n2.  **Test Plasmid:** The same minigene as the control, but with the hypothesized 6-nucleotide ESE sequence inserted into the center of exon E2.\n\nEach plasmid is transfected into a population of cultured human cells.
