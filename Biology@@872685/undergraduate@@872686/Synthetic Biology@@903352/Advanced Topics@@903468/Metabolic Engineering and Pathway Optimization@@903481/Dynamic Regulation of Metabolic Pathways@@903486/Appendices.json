The pathway starts with a non-toxic substrate, S, which is naturally available within the cell. The first enzyme, $E_1$, converts S into an Intermediate, I. The second enzyme, $E_2$, then converts I into the desired Product P.\n\nThe pathway is: $S \\xrightarrow{E_1} I \\xrightarrow{E_2} P$\n\nThe genes for $E_1$ and $E_2$ are placed on a single plasmid under the control of an inducible promoter. While Product P is harmless, the Intermediate I is known to be toxic to the cells at high concentrations, inhibiting growth and reducing overall productivity.\n\nTo optimize the production of P while minimizing toxicity, the biologist decides to use a pre-characterized library of Ribosome Binding Sites (RBS) to control the translation rate of each enzyme. A stronger RBS leads to a higher rate of protein synthesis and thus a higher concentration of the enzyme. The available library contains three RBS variants with well-defined relative strengths: Weak, Medium, and Strong.\n\nThe biologist must choose one RBS for the gene encoding $E_1$ and a second RBS for the gene encoding $E_2$.

The RBS strength chosen for each gene sets $[E_1]$ and $[E_2]$ proportionally, so $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ scale with the RBS strengths of $E_1$ and $E_2$, respectively. The problem states the kinetic properties are roughly similar, so it is reasonable to consider $k_{\\text{cat},1}\\approx k_{\\text{cat},2}$ and $K_{1}\\approx K_{2}$.\n\nTo avoid accumulation of the toxic intermediate $I$ while maximizing flux to $P$, set a quasi–steady state for $I$, which requires $v_{1}=v_{2}$. Thus,\n$$\n\\frac{V_{1}S}{K_{1}+S}=\\frac{V_{2}I}{K_{2}+I}.\n$$\nSolving for $I$ yields\n$$\nI=\\frac{V_{1}SK_{2}}{V_{2}(K_{1}+S)-V_{1}S}.\n$$\nTwo key design principles follow:\n\n1) Avoiding toxic accumulation requires the denominator to be positive:\n$$\nV_{2}(K_{1}+S)-V_{1}S>0\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad V_{2}>\\frac{V_{1}S}{K_{1}+S}.\n$$\nIn particular, if $S\\gg K_{1}$ (substrate abundant intracellularly), then $\\frac{S}{K_{1}+S}\\approx 1$, so one needs $V_{2}\\gtrsim V_{1}$, with larger $V_{2}$ making $I$ smaller. Because $I$ decreases as $V_{2}$ increases (for fixed $V_{1}$), choosing a stronger RBS for $E_2$ than for $E_1$ minimizes $I$.\n\n2) The steady-state flux $J$ equals $v_{1}=v_{2}$. When $V_{2}$ is sufficiently large such that the inequality above holds, the flux is\n$$\nJ=v_{1}=\\frac{V_{1}S}{K_{1}+S},\n$$\nso the flux is then limited by $E_1$. Therefore, strong $E_1$ increases the maximal possible flux but risks $I$ buildup unless $E_2$ is even stronger; conversely, a weak $E_1$ paired with strong $E_2$ prevents $I$ accumulation while maintaining as much flux as $E_1$ can supply.\n\nEvaluating the options under the assumption of similar kinetic constants:\n- A (Strong $E_1$, Weak $E_2$): $V_{1}\\gg V_{2}$ violates $V_{2}>\\frac{V_{1}S}{K_{1}+S}$, leading to large $I$ and toxicity.\n- B (Weak $E_1$, Strong $E_2$): $V_{2}\\gg V_{1}$ satisfies the inequality, keeps $I$ low, and sets flux by $E_1$ without toxic buildup; this is the standard “pull” strategy to drain the toxic intermediate.\n- C (Strong $E_1$, Strong $E_2$): If $V_{1}\\approx V_{2}$ and $S$ is high, the denominator $V_{2}(K_{1}+S)-V_{1}S$ can be small, giving a large $I$ and risking toxicity; not the safest initial design.\n- D (Weak $E_1$, Weak $E_2$): Low $I$ but also low flux; not optimal for productivity.\n\nThus, the most rational initial design to maximize flux to $P$ while mitigating toxicity is to make $E_2$ stronger than $E_1$, specifically Weak $E_1$ with Strong $E_2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2034083"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple on-or-off control, synthetic biology aims to create circuits with sophisticated, programmed responses. This problem [@problem_id:2034119] asks you to design a genetic \"band-pass filter,\" a circuit that activates a gene only when a key metabolite's concentration is within an optimal window—not too low and not too high. This practice will sharpen your understanding of how to combine transcriptional activators and repressors to implement specific logical functions at the promoter level.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology project, a team of researchers is engineering a bacterium to perform bioremediation of an industrial pollutant, Compound X. The engineered metabolic pathway converts Compound X into a harmless product, Compound Y, through an essential intermediate metabolite, M. While the overall process is beneficial, high intracellular concentrations of the metabolite M have been found to be cytotoxic. To maintain cell viability, the expression of a critical pathway enzyme, EnzymeZ (encoded by the gene `GeneZ`), must be tightly regulated.\n\nThe goal is to design a genetic circuit that functions as a \"band-pass filter.\" This circuit should ensure that `GeneZ` is expressed only when the concentration of M, denoted as $[M]$, is within an optimal, non-toxic range. Specifically, `GeneZ` expression should be high only when $[M]$ is greater than a low concentration threshold, $C_L$, but less than a high concentration threshold, $C_H$.\n\nYou are provided with the following genetic parts:\n- `GeneZ`: The output gene of interest.\n- `TF_A`: A transcriptional activator protein. It becomes active and binds to its specific DNA operator site only when it is allosterically bound to the metabolite M. The concentration of M required for its activation corresponds to the threshold $C_L$.\n- `TF_R`: A transcriptional repressor protein. It becomes active and binds to its specific DNA operator site only when it is allosterically bound to the metabolite M. The concentration of M required for its activation is much higher and corresponds to the threshold $C_H$.\n\nWhich of the following circuit architectures would correctly implement the desired band-pass filter behavior for the expression of `GeneZ`?\n\nA. `GeneZ` is controlled by a promoter that is activated by `TF_A`.\n\nB. `GeneZ` is controlled by a promoter that contains operator sites for both `TF_A` and `TF_R`. Activation by `TF_A` is required for expression, and binding of `TF_R` overrides this activation.\n\nC. `GeneZ` is controlled by a constitutively active promoter that is repressed by `TF_R`.\n\nD. `GeneZ` is controlled by a promoter that is activated by `TF_R` and repressed by `TF_A`.", "solution": "The problem asks for the design of a genetic circuit that acts as a band-pass filter for gene expression. This means the target gene, `GeneZ`, should be expressed only when the concentration of the input signal, metabolite M, is within a specific range: $C_L < [M] < C_H$.\n\nLet's break down this logical requirement into two separate conditions that must be simultaneously true (a logical AND operation):\n1. The concentration of M must be above a low threshold: $[M] > C_L$.\n2. The concentration of M must be below a high threshold: $[M] < C_H$.\n\nNow, we will analyze the provided genetic parts and how they can be used to implement these two conditions.\n\n**Condition 1: $[M] > C_L$ (Low-end threshold)**\nThis condition requires the circuit to turn ON when $[M]$ surpasses the low threshold $C_L$. This is the function of a high-pass filter. The problem provides `TF_A`, a transcriptional activator that becomes active upon binding M, with an activation threshold corresponding to $C_L$. Therefore, having `TF_A` activate the promoter of `GeneZ` will satisfy this part of the logic. When $[M] > C_L$, the active `TF_A` will bind to the promoter and initiate transcription. When $[M] < C_L$, `TF_A` is inactive, and the gene remains OFF.\n\n**Condition 2: $[M] < C_H$ (High-end threshold)**\nThis condition requires the circuit to be ON only when $[M]$ is below the high threshold $C_H$. This is the function of a low-pass filter. An equivalent way to state this is that the circuit must turn OFF when $[M]$ surpasses the high threshold $C_H$. The problem provides `TF_R`, a transcriptional repressor that becomes active upon binding M, with an activation threshold corresponding to $C_H$. Therefore, having `TF_R` repress the promoter of `GeneZ` will satisfy this part of the logic. When $[M] > C_H$, the active `TF_R` will bind to the promoter and block transcription. When $[M] < C_H$, `TF_R` is inactive, and it will not repress the gene.\n\n**Combining the Conditions for a Band-Pass Filter**\nTo achieve the $C_L < [M] < C_H$ behavior, we need both conditions to be met. The gene must be activated by `TF_A` AND not repressed by `TF_R`. A promoter architecture that combines these two elements is required. The promoter must have a binding site for the activator `TF_A` to turn the gene ON, and also a binding site for the repressor `TF_R` to shut the gene OFF at high concentrations.\n\nLet's analyze the system's behavior with this combined architecture:\n- **Case 1: $[M] < C_L$**\nIn this case, $[M]$ is not high enough to activate `TF_A` nor `TF_R`. Since activation by `TF_A` is required for expression, the gene remains OFF. This is correct.\n\n- **Case 2: $C_L < [M] < C_H$**\nIn this range, $[M]$ is high enough to activate `TF_A`, but not high enough to activate `TF_R`. Active `TF_A` binds to the promoter and turns the gene ON. Inactive `TF_R` does not bind, so there is no repression. The gene is expressed. This is the desired \"pass\" band.\n\n- **Case 3: $[M] > C_H$**\nIn this range, $[M]$ is high enough to activate both `TF_A` and `TF_R`. While active `TF_A` is present, the now-active `TF_R` also binds to its operator site on the promoter. In typical genetic circuit design, repressor binding is dominant and overrides activation, blocking transcription. The gene is OFF. This is correct.\n\nThis combined architecture successfully implements a band-pass filter.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\n**A. `GeneZ` is controlled by a promoter that is activated by `TF_A`.**\nThis circuit implements only Condition 1. The gene turns ON when $[M] > C_L$. There is no mechanism to turn it off at high concentrations. This is a high-pass filter, not a band-pass filter.\n\n**B. `GeneZ` is controlled by a promoter that contains operator sites for both `TF_A` and `TF_R`. Activation by `TF_A` is required for expression, and binding of `TF_R` overrides this activation.**\nThis perfectly matches our derived architecture. It combines the high-pass activation from `TF_A` and the low-pass repression from `TF_R` to create a band-pass filter. This is the correct answer.\n\n**C. `GeneZ` is controlled by a constitutively active promoter that is repressed by `TF_R`.**\nA constitutively active promoter is always ON by default. The repressor `TF_R` turns it OFF when $[M] > C_H$. So, the gene is ON for $[M] < C_H$ and OFF for $[M] > C_H$. This is a low-pass filter, not a band-pass filter.\n\n**D. `GeneZ` is controlled by a promoter that is activated by `TF_R` and repressed by `TF_A`.**\nThis circuit swaps the roles of the regulators. `TF_A` would repress when $[M] > C_L$, and `TF_R` would activate when $[M] > C_H$.\n- If $[M] < C_L$: no repression, no activation. Gene is OFF.\n- If $C_L < [M] < C_H$: `TF_A` represses, `TF_R` doesn't activate. Gene is OFF.\n- If $[M] > C_H$: `TF_A` represses AND `TF_R` activates. The outcome depends on which is dominant, but it's clearly not a band-pass filter. It's likely OFF under most conditions. This architecture is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly implements the band-pass logic is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2034119"}, {"introduction": "Dynamic regulation can also occur after a protein is synthesized, offering rapid and efficient control.

To create a \"just-in-time\" production system that prevents wasteful enzyme synthesis when the substrate is scarce, the enzyme $E$ is fused to a protein degradation tag (a degron).\n\nThe system operates as follows:\n- The engineered enzyme, $E$, is produced at a constant rate, $k_{prod}$.\n- The substrate, $S$, is supplied to the cell culture at a variable rate, denoted by an influx $v_{in}$.\n- The enzymatic conversion of $S$ to $P$ follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a catalytic rate constant $k_{cat}$ and a Michaelis constant $K_M$.\n- The degron's activity is allosterically regulated by the substrate $S$. When $S$ binds to an allosteric site on the enzyme-degron complex, it masks the degron and reduces the rate of degradation. The effective first-order degradation rate constant for the enzyme, $k_{deg}([S])$, is dependent on the substrate concentration $[S]$ according to the following model:\n$$k_{deg}([S]) = k_{deg,min} + (k_{deg,max} - k_{deg,min}) \\frac{K_d}{K_d + [S]}$$\nwhere $k_{deg,min}$ is the minimum possible degradation rate constant (achieved at saturating $[S]$), $k_{deg,max}$ is the maximum rate constant (at zero $[S]$), and $K_d$ is the dissociation constant for the binding of S to the allosteric site.\n\nAssuming the system reaches a steady state for any given constant substrate influx $v_{in}$, determine the theoretical dynamic range of the enzyme's concentration.
