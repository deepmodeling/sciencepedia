By working through this problem, you will learn to quantify how enzyme specificity directly impacts flux partitioning and overall product yield, a crucial consideration for pathway design and optimization.", "problem": "A synthetic biology team is engineering a bacterium to produce a new pharmaceutical compound, designated as product $P$. The metabolic pathway involves an intermediate, $I$, which is naturally produced from a primary metabolite at a constant rate $v_{in}$. In the team's initial design, a highly specific enzyme $E_{orig}$ was used to convert intermediate $I$ into the final product $P$. Under these conditions, the pathway operated at steady-state, and the production rate of $P$, denoted as $J_{orig}$, was found to be equal to $v_{in}$.\n\nIn an attempt to optimize the pathway, the team replaces the original enzyme $E_{orig}$ with a newly discovered, purportedly more active enzyme, $E_{new}$. However, subsequent analysis reveals that $E_{new}$ is promiscuous. It catalyzes both the desired reaction of converting $I$ to $P$ and an undesired side reaction that converts $I$ into a metabolically inert byproduct, $Q$.\n\nBoth reactions catalyzed by the single enzyme $E_{new}$ follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, where the intermediate $I$ acts as the substrate. The kinetic parameters for the two reactions are as follows:\n- For the desired reaction $I \\to P$: the catalytic rate constant is $k_{cat,P}$.\n- For the side reaction $I \\to Q$: the catalytic rate constant is $k_{cat,Q}$.\n- The Michaelis constant for the binding of substrate $I$ to the enzyme $E_{new}$ is $K_{M}$, which is the same for both reaction pathways.\n\nAfter replacing the enzyme, the system is allowed to reach a new steady state.
