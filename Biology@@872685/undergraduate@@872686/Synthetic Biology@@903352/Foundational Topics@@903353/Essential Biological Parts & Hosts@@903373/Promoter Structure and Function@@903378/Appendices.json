By comparing a promoter's key elements—the -35 and -10 boxes—to ideal consensus sequences, we can predict its relative strength. This exercise challenges you to apply these fundamental rules to evaluate two synthetic promoters, a core skill in selecting parts for a genetic circuit. [@problem_id:2058648]", "problem": "In a synthetic biology project, a student is designing a genetic circuit in *Escherichia coli* and needs to select a promoter to drive the expression of a reporter gene. The strength of the promoter, which correlates to the rate of transcription initiation, is a critical design parameter. The student has synthesized two potential promoters, Promoter A and Promoter B, and needs to predict which one is likely to be stronger.\n\nThe strength of a typical *E. coli* promoter recognized by the sigma-70 ($\\sigma^{70}$) transcription factor is largely determined by how well its sequence matches the ideal consensus sequences at two key regions: the -35 box and the -10 box. The spacing between these two boxes is also critical.\n\nThe consensus sequences and optimal spacing are as follows:\n- **-35 box consensus:** 5'-TTGACA-3'\n- **-10 box consensus:** 5'-TATAAT-3'\n- **Optimal spacer length:** 17 base pairs\n\nThe sequences of the two synthetic promoters are given below, with the -35 and -10 regions shown. The spacer is the sequence of nucleotides between these two regions.\n\n**Promoter A:**\n-35 region: 5'-TTGACA-3'\nSpacer: (16 nucleotides long)\n-10 region: 5'-TATGAT-3'\n\n**Promoter B:**\n-35 region: 5'-TTGAAA-3'\nSpacer: (17 nucleotides long)\n-10 region: 5'-TATAAT-3'\n\nBased on a comparative analysis of these promoter elements against the consensus, which of the following statements is the most accurate prediction?\n\nA. Promoter A is stronger because its -35 box is a perfect match to the consensus sequence.\n\nB. Promoter B is stronger because its -10 box perfectly matches the consensus sequence and it has the optimal spacer length.\n\nC. The promoters will have similar strength because each has two deviations from the ideal promoter structure (Promoter A has one mismatch in the -10 box and a suboptimal spacer length; Promoter B has one mismatch in the -35 box and one in the -10 box).\n\nD. Promoter A is stronger because its -10 box mismatch is at a less critical position than the -35 box mismatch in Promoter B.\n\nE. Promoter B is stronger because an A-rich -35 box is generally more effective at recruiting RNA Polymerase than a G-C rich box.", "solution": "Principle: For a typical Escherichia coli $\\sigma^{70}$ promoter, transcriptional strength correlates with how closely the promoter matches the consensus sequences at the $-35$ box and $-10$ box, and with having the optimal spacer length between these boxes.

Aligning to TATAAT shows a mismatch at the fourth position (A in consensus versus G in the sequence), with all other positions matching, hence\n$$m_{10}^{(\\text{A})} = 1.$$\n- Spacer length is $16$, thus\n$$d^{(\\text{A})} = 16 - 17 = -1, \\quad |d^{(\\text{A})}| = 1.$$\n\nAnalyze Promoter B:\n- $-35$ region is TTGAAA. Relative to TTGACA, there is a single mismatch at the fifth position (C in consensus versus A in the sequence), hence\n$$m_{35}^{(\\text{B})} = 1.$$\n- $-10$ region is TATAAT, which is a perfect match to TATAAT, so\n$$m_{10}^{(\\text{B})} = 0.$$\n- Spacer length is $17$, thus\n$$d^{(\\text{B})} = 17 - 17 = 0, \\quad |d^{(\\text{B})}| = 0.$$\n\nComparative prediction: Promoter A has an advantage at the $-35$ box but is disadvantaged at the $-10$ box and in spacer length. Promoter B has an advantage at the $-10$ box and spacer length but a disadvantage at the $-35$ box. Given the greater functional impact of a perfect $-10$ box and optimal spacing relative to a perfect $-35$ box, Promoter B is predicted to be stronger.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is not most accurate because it ignores the more critical $-10$ box mismatch and suboptimal spacing of Promoter A.\n- B correctly identifies the perfect $-10$ box and optimal spacing of Promoter B as decisive.\n- C is factually incorrect about Promoter B having a $-10$ mismatch; it does not.\n- D is not supported; mismatches in the $-10$ box are generally more detrimental than comparable $-35$ mismatches.\n- E is incorrect; the consensus, not generic A-richness, predicts strength, and the consensus $-35$ includes a C at the fifth position.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that Promoter B is stronger.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2058648"}, {"introduction": "While sequence analysis provides valuable predictions, experimental data is the ultimate test of function.
