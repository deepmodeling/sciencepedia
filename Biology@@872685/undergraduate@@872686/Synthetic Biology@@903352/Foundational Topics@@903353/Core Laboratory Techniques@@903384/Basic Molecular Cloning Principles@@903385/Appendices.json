While ligating identical 'sticky ends' is straightforward, expert cloners leverage subtle compatibilities between different enzymes to their advantage.

The strategy involves inserting a gene, `gene_X`, into the plasmid. The `pSynth-1` vector contains a unique restriction site for the enzyme BglII within its multiple cloning site. The `gene_X` DNA fragment has been amplified via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and subsequently cloned into an intermediate vector, from which it can be excised using the enzyme BamHI, as there are BamHI sites flanking the gene.\n\nThe recognition and cleavage sites for these two Type II restriction endonucleases are as follows, where the apostrophe (') indicates the cut site in the phosphodiester backbone:\n\n-   **BamHI**: 5'-G'GATCC-3'\n-   **BglII**: 5'-A'GATCT-3'\n\nThe biologist digests the `pSynth-1` vector with BglII and the DNA containing `gene_X` with BamHI.

The ligation will be successful, but the newly formed junction sites can be cleaved by neither BamHI nor BglII.\n\nF. The ligation will be successful, but the `gene_X` fragment can only be inserted in one specific orientation relative to the vector.", "solution": "We begin by determining the cohesive ends produced by BamHI and BglII. The recognition sequences and cleavage positions are:\n- BamHI: 5'-GGATCC-3' with cleavage between the first and second G, yielding a 5' overhang of sequence GATC.\n- BglII: 5'-AGATCT-3' with cleavage between A and G, yielding a 5' overhang of sequence GATC.\n\nExplicitly, the BamHI-cleaved ends can be represented as:\n5' ... G\nGATC\nC ... 3'\n3' ... C\nCTAG\nG ... 5'\n\nThe BglII-cleaved ends can be represented as:\n5' ... A\nGATC\nT ... 3'\n3' ... T\nCTAG\nA ... 5'\n\nStep 1: Assess compatibility of overhangs. Both enzymes generate the same 5' overhang, GATC. Therefore, the single-stranded overhangs are compatible and can anneal. In the presence of T4 DNA ligase, these annealed ends can be covalently ligated. Hence, ligation can be successful.\n\nStep 2: Determine the sequence at the newly formed junctions after ligation. Because the overhang is GATC, the base immediately 5' to the overhang and the base immediately 3' to the overhang are determined by the enzyme that created each side:\n- For a BglII end, the flanking context on the top strand is A (5') and T (3'), i.e., A GATC T.\n- For a BamHI end, the flanking context on the top strand is G (5') and C (3'), i.e., G GATC C.\n\nWhen a BglII end ligates to a BamHI end, there are two possible junctions depending on which side comes from which enzyme:\n- Junction 1 (BglII 5' flank to BamHI 3' flank): A GATC C, i.e., AGATCC.\n- Junction 2 (BamHI 5' flank to BglII 3' flank): G GATC T, i.e., GGATCT.\n\nStep 3: Test whether either junction recreates a BamHI or BglII site.\n- BamHI requires GGATCC. Neither AGATCC nor GGATCT matches GGATCC.\n- BglII requires AGATCT. Neither AGATCC nor GGATCT matches AGATCT.\n\nTherefore, although ligation is successful, the chimeric junctions do not regenerate recognition sites for either enzyme; they are not cleavable by BamHI or BglII.\n\nStep 4: Assess orientation constraints. Both ends of the insert cut with BamHI have identical GATC overhangs, and both ends of the BglII-cut vector also have identical GATC overhangs. Thus, the insert can ligate into the vector in either orientation; orientation is not constrained by the ends.\n\nConclusion: The overhangs are compatible, ligation proceeds, and the resulting junctions cannot be cleaved by either BamHI or BglII. The most accurate choice is that ligation is successful, but the newly formed junction sites are not cleavable by either enzyme.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2021378"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond single gene insertion, synthetic biology often requires the assembly of complex genetic parts, such as genes with highly repetitive sequences for creating novel biomaterials or protein scaffolds. These structures are notoriously unstable both during in vitro amplification and inside the host cell, posing a significant design challenge. This advanced problem [@problem_id:2021380] asks you to evaluate and select a robust multi-step strategy, integrating knowledge of assembly methods and host cell genetics to overcome these common failure modes.", "problem": "A synthetic biology research team aims to construct a gene encoding a novel biopolymer. This gene, designated `rep-10x`, must consist of exactly ten head-to-tail tandem repeats of a 200 base pair (bp) DNA sequence that codes for a structural monomer. The team starts with a standard high-copy pUC19-based plasmid containing a single copy of this 200 bp sequence, flanked by appropriate restriction sites. The goal is to assemble the `rep-10x` gene and clone it into a final expression vector for stable propagation.\n\nThe primary challenge is the inherent instability of tandem DNA repeats, which are prone to deletion through two main mechanisms: (1) polymerase slippage during Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification and (2) in vivo homologous recombination within the *E. coli* host.\n\nYou are tasked with evaluating several proposed cloning strategies. Your objective is to identify the single strategy that is the most robust and reliable for successfully constructing and maintaining the full-length `rep-10x` gene.\n\nAvailable resources include: standard restriction enzymes, DNA ligase, various high-fidelity DNA polymerases, competent cells of the standard cloning strain *E. coli* DH5alpha (`recA1 endA1`), and the specialized strain *E. coli* Stbl3 (`recA13 endA1 mcrB mrr`).\n\nWhich of the following strategies is the most likely to succeed?\n\nA. Use primers flanking the 200 bp unit to amplify a large quantity of the monomer fragment. Perform a multi-fragment ligation reaction with a 10:1 molar ratio of insert to a linearized vector to encourage concatenation. Transform the ligation product into *E. coli* DH5alpha and screen colonies for the full-length 10-repeat insert.\n\nB. Design the initial 200 bp monomer plasmid with Type IIS restriction sites (e.g., for Golden Gate Assembly). Use a recursive, iterative strategy: first assemble a 2-repeat dimer, then purify it and use it to assemble a 4-repeat unit, then an 8-repeat unit, and finally an 8+2=10 repeat unit. Transform the final assembly product into *E. coli* DH5alpha for propagation.\n\nC. Design primers that anneal to the ends of the full 2000 bp `rep-10x` target sequence. Use the initial single-repeat plasmid as a template in a long-range PCR reaction, expecting polymerase slippage to occasionally generate the full 10-repeat product. Run the PCR product on a gel, excise the band corresponding to ~2000 bp, and ligate it into the vector. Transform into the specialized *E. coli* Stbl3 strain.\n\nD. Design the initial 200 bp monomer plasmid with Type IIS restriction sites (e.g., for Golden Gate Assembly). Use a recursive, iterative strategy: first assemble a 2-repeat dimer, then purify it and use it to assemble a 4-repeat unit, then an 8-repeat unit, and finally an 8+2=10 repeat unit. Transform the final assembly product into the specialized *E. coli* Stbl3 strain for propagation.\n\nE. Use a very high-fidelity, proofreading DNA polymerase and long extension times to amplify the 200 bp unit from the template plasmid. Ligate the fragments together into a low-copy number plasmid (e.g., a pSC101-based vector) instead of the high-copy pUC19 vector. Transform into *E. coli* DH5alpha.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must analyze each proposed strategy and evaluate its effectiveness in mitigating the two key failure modes: PCR-induced errors (polymerase slippage) and in vivo instability (homologous recombination).\n\n**Principle 1: Instability during PCR**\nLong tandem repeats are notoriously difficult to amplify using PCR. The DNA polymerase can \"slip\" on the template strand because of the repetitive sequence. If the polymerase dissociates and re-anneals out of register on an upstream or downstream repeat unit, the resulting product will have a different number of repeats than the template. This leads to a heterogeneous population of PCR products with varying lengths. Strategies that involve PCR amplification of a template that already contains multiple repeats are highly susceptible to this issue.\n\n**Principle 2: In vivo Instability**\nOnce a plasmid containing a tandem repeat array is inside a host cell like *E. coli*, the cell's DNA repair and recombination machinery can recognize the homologous sequences. The RecA protein is the primary catalyst for homologous recombination. It can mediate an intramolecular crossover event between two of the repeats, leading to the excision of the intervening DNA as a small circle and the \"collapse\" of the plasmid to a shorter version with fewer repeats. While standard cloning strains like DH5alpha are `recA-`, they are not completely free of recombination activity. For highly unstable sequences like long tandem repeats, specialized strains with additional mutations that further suppress recombination pathways are required for stable propagation. *E. coli* Stbl3 is such a strain, carrying mutations like `recA13` and `endA1` which are optimized for stabilizing repetitive DNA.\n\nNow we evaluate each option based on these principles:\n\n**Analysis of Strategy A:** This strategy is flawed in two major ways. First, attempting to ligate ten fragments together in one pot (\"multi-fragment ligation\") is inefficient and will produce a wide array of products, with the desired 10-repeat construct being very rare. More importantly, it completely ignores the in vivo instability. Propagating the resulting plasmid in DH5alpha, a standard strain, will almost certainly lead to the deletion of repeats via recombination, even if the correct construct was successfully formed.\n\n**Analysis of Strategy B:** This strategy correctly addresses the PCR-induced instability. By using an iterative assembly method like Golden Gate, where constructs are built up step-by-step (e.g., 1x + 1x -> 2x; 2x + 2x -> 4x; etc.), PCR is never used to amplify an already repetitive template. This ensures the building blocks for each step are well-defined and homogenous. However, this strategy fails to address the in vivo instability. Transforming the final 10-repeat construct into the standard DH5alpha strain leaves it vulnerable to recombination and collapse. Stable propagation would be very difficult.\n\n**Analysis of Strategy C:** This strategy is fundamentally flawed at the synthesis step. Attempting to generate a 2000 bp tandem repeat product from a 200 bp template via PCR relies on random, uncontrolled polymerase slippage. While some longer products might be formed, the process is not controlled, and the dominant products will be shorter. Isolating the correct 2000 bp product from this smear would be difficult and yield very little material. Although it correctly identifies the need for a specialized host (Stbl3) for propagation, the initial construct being transformed is highly likely to be incorrect in the first place.\n\n**Analysis of D:** This is the most robust strategy as it addresses both failure modes with specific, targeted solutions.\n1.  **Iterative Assembly (e.g., Golden Gate):** This solves the PCR problem by avoiding amplification of a repetitive template. The `rep-10x` gene is built in vitro in a controlled, stepwise manner, ensuring the final assembled DNA is the correct length and sequence.\n2.  **Specialized Host (*E. coli* Stbl3):** This solves the in vivo stability problem. By transforming the correctly assembled plasmid into a host strain engineered to suppress recombination (Stbl3), the 10-repeat array is protected from deletion during plasmid replication and propagation. This combination provides the highest probability of both successfully constructing and stably maintaining the desired `rep-10x` gene.\n\n**Analysis of Strategy E:** This strategy presents common but insufficient solutions. While a high-fidelity polymerase is good for reducing point mutations, it does not prevent polymerase slippage, which is a physical-mechanical problem, not an enzymatic fidelity issue. Using a low-copy number plasmid can help by reducing the metabolic burden and providing fewer plasmid copies per cell as targets for recombination, but it does not eliminate the host's intrinsic recombination machinery. The fundamental instability remains, and in a standard DH5alpha host, the plasmid is still likely to collapse over time. This approach is less effective than using a specialized host strain specifically designed to prevent recombination.\n\nTherefore, Strategy D represents the most comprehensive and state-of-the-art approach to this common synthetic biology challenge.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2021380"}]}
