The operon consists of two genes, Gene A and Gene B, arranged sequentially and controlled by a single upstream promoter. To achieve a specific balance of the proteins produced (Protein A and Protein B), a transcriptional terminator is inserted between the two genes.\n\nThe system can be modeled with the following assumptions:\n1.  The promoter initiates transcription at a constant rate.\n2.  The intergenic terminator has an efficiency $\\eta_T$, defined as the fraction of transcription events that terminate after Gene A. The remaining fraction, $1 - \\eta_T$, proceeds through the terminator, transcribing Gene B.

Protein A is translated from both the short and the long transcripts. Protein B is translated only from the long transcript.\n4.  The translation initiation rate is determined by the Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) upstream of each gene's coding sequence.
