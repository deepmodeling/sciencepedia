This practice [@problem_id:2075226] explores the consequences of a single point mutation, demonstrating how a small change can lead to a drastic outcome like premature translation termination. Analyzing such mutational pathways is crucial for troubleshooting failed experiments and for understanding the evolutionary constraints on protein sequences.", "problem": "A synthetic biology research team is engineering *E. coli* to produce a novel metalloprotein. A critical structural feature of this protein is a disulfide bond formed between two cysteine residues. During initial protein expression trials, the team observes through gel electrophoresis that the produced protein is much shorter than its designed length, indicating premature termination of translation. DNA sequencing of the engineered plasmid reveals that a single point mutation has occurred in the gene. The mutation is located within a codon that was intended to encode for cysteine (Cys).\n\nTo help with the analysis, here is the relevant subset of the standard messenger RNA (mRNA) genetic code:\n- Cysteine (Cys) is encoded by the codons: UGU, UGC.\n- Translation is terminated by the \"stop\" codons: UAA, UAG, UGA.\n\nAssuming the mutation occurred in one of the legitimate cysteine codons, how many distinct single-nucleotide point mutations can account for the observed premature termination? A distinct mutation is defined by a unique change of a specific nucleotide at a specific position within one of the original cysteine codons.", "solution": "We are given that cysteine is encoded by the mRNA codons UGU and UGC, and the stop codons are UAA, UAG, and UGA. A single-nucleotide point mutation means exactly one base in the codon is changed. Therefore, we need to count all single-base substitutions that convert either UGU or UGC into one of the stop codons.\n\nDefine the Hamming distance between two codons as the number of positions at which they differ. A valid single-nucleotide mutation corresponds to Hamming distance equal to 1.\n\nCheck UGU against each stop codon:\n- UGU to UGA: differs only at position 3 (U to A), so distance is 1. This is a valid mutation.\n- UGU to UAA: differs at positions 2 (G to A) and 3 (U to A), so distance is 2. Not valid.\n- UGU to UAG: differs at positions 2 (G to A) and 3 (U to G), so distance is 2. Not valid.\n\nCheck UGC against each stop codon:\n- UGC to UGA: differs only at position 3 (C to A), so distance is 1. This is a valid mutation.\n- UGC to UAA: differs at positions 2 (G to A) and 3 (C to A), so distance is 2. Not valid.\n- UGC to UAG: differs at positions 2 (G to A) and 3 (C to G), so distance is 2. Not valid.\n\nThus, there are exactly two distinct single-nucleotide point mutations that convert a cysteine codon to a stop codon:\n- In UGU: position 3, U to A, yielding UGA.\n- In UGC: position 3, C to A, yielding UGA.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct single-nucleotide point mutations is 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2075226"}, {"introduction": "A key skill in synthetic biology is the design of multifunctional genetic parts. This problem [@problem_id:2075230] asks you to create a DNA sequence that simultaneously encodes a dipeptide and serves as a recognition site for a common restriction enzyme. Successfully solving this puzzle requires a precise understanding of transcription, the roles of the coding and template strands, and the genetic code itself.", "problem": "In the field of synthetic biology, engineers often design DNA sequences to be multifunctional. A common task is to create a sequence that both codes for a specific amino acid sequence and contains a recognition site for a restriction enzyme.\n\nConsider the task of designing a short genetic element that encodes the dipeptide Glutamic acid followed by Phenylalanine (Glu-Phe). The design also requires this 6-base pair segment of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to be a recognition site for the restriction enzyme EcoRI.

Thus, if the coding strand is 5'-N_{1}N_{2}\\dots-3', then the mRNA is 5'-N_{1}'N_{2}'\\dots-3' with T replaced by U.\n- The template (antisense) DNA strand is read by RNA polymerase in the 3' to 5' direction to synthesize mRNA 5' to 3' that is complementary to the template.\n\nGiven codons:\n- Glu: mRNA codons GAA or GAG.\n- Phe: mRNA codons UUU or UUC.\n\nCase 1: The 5'-GAATTC-3' strand is the coding strand.\n- The mRNA is obtained by replacing T with U: 5'-GAAUUC-3'.\n- Grouping into codons: GAA (Glu) and UUC (Phe).\n- Therefore, the sequence encodes Glu-Phe.\n\nCase 2: The 5'-GAATTC-3' strand is the template strand.\n- Transcription reads the template 3' to 5'. Write the template with positions indexed left to right as 5'-G(1)A(2)A(3)T(4)T(5)C(6)-3'.\n- The mRNA 5' to 3' is the complement of the template read from its 3' end to 5' end:\n  - Template position 6: C pairs with G in mRNA.\n  - Position 5: T pairs with A in mRNA.\n  - Position 4: T pairs with A in mRNA.\n  - Position 3: A pairs with U in mRNA.\n  - Position 2: A pairs with U in mRNA.\n  - Position 1: G pairs with C in mRNA.\n- Hence the mRNA is 5'-GAAUUC-3'.\n- Grouping into codons: GAA (Glu) and UUC (Phe).\n- Therefore, the sequence encodes Glu-Phe.\n\nConclusion:\nBecause the EcoRI site is palindromic, in either case the mRNA produced from this 6-base segment is 5'-GAAUUC-3', which encodes Glu-Phe.
