This exercise challenges you to think like a cell biologist, predicting the immediate consequences of a specific disruption in the ribosome production line [@problem_id:2064948]. By analyzing a hypothetical mutation that blocks the export of the large 60S subunit from the nucleus, you will reinforce your understanding of the sequential steps of translation initiation and pinpoint the exact bottleneck in protein synthesis.", "problem": "A researcher is studying a mutant strain of the fungus *Aspergillus nidulans*. This particular strain possesses a temperature-sensitive mutation in a gene encoding a specific nuclear export protein. At the permissive temperature, the protein functions normally. However, when the fungal culture is shifted to a restrictive (higher) temperature, this export protein becomes non-functional. Further experiments reveal that this protein is exclusively required for the transport of newly assembled $60S$ ribosomal subunits from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The export of Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA), Transfer Ribonucleic Acid (tRNA), and $40S$ ribosomal subunits remains completely unaffected.\n\nAssuming the fungal cells are actively growing and synthesizing proteins at the permissive temperature before being abruptly shifted to the restrictive temperature, which of the following statements describes the most immediate and primary defect in the process of protein synthesis?\n\nA. The synthesis of new ribosomal proteins will be the first process to halt, leading to a feedback inhibition of Ribosomal Ribonucleic Acid (rRNA) transcription.\nB. All $80S$ ribosomes currently translating mRNAs in the cytoplasm will immediately stall and dissociate, releasing incomplete polypeptide chains.\nC. The $40S$ ribosomal subunits in the cytoplasm will be unable to bind to the 5' cap of mRNA molecules to form pre-initiation complexes.\nD. Translation initiation will proceed to the point of forming a $48S$ initiation complex (composed of the $40S$ subunit, mRNA, and initiator tRNA), but the subsequent formation of an $80S$ ribosome will be blocked, thus preventing the elongation phase.\nE. The concentration of free amino acids in the cytoplasm will rapidly increase because they are no longer being incorporated into polypeptides.", "solution": "The mutation inactivates, at the restrictive temperature, a nuclear export protein that is exclusively required for export of newly assembled $60S$ ribosomal subunits. Export of mRNA, tRNA, and $40S$ subunits remains intact. Therefore, after the temperature shift, no new $60S$ subunits can enter the cytoplasm, while the existing cytoplasmic pools of $40S$ subunits, mRNAs, tRNAs, and initiation/elongation factors are unaffected.\n\nIn eukaryotic translation initiation, the sequence of events is:\n1) Formation of the $43S$ preinitiation complex: a cytoplasmic $40S$ subunit binds eIFs and initiator Met-tRNAi.\n2) Recruitment to the mRNA 5' cap and scanning: the $43S$ complex associates with the capped mRNA (via eIF4F and associated factors) to form the $48S$ initiation complex, then scans to the start codon.\n3) Large subunit joining: a cytoplasmic $60S$ subunit joins the $48S$ complex to form an $80S$ ribosome; only then can elongation proceed.\n\nGiven that $40S$ subunits and mRNA export are unaffected, steps (1) and (2) can proceed normally after the shift. The first step that specifically requires a cytoplasmic $60S$ subunit is large subunit joining (step 3). Because newly assembled $60S$ subunits are now trapped in the nucleus, the cytoplasmic supply of $60S$ subunits cannot be replenished. Ongoing $80S$ ribosomes that are already elongating will continue to translate until they terminate, because their function does not depend on nuclear export during elongation. However, new rounds of initiation will become blocked at the point of $60S$ joining: $40S$ subunits will still form $48S$ complexes on mRNAs, but formation of new $80S$ ribosomes will be prevented in the absence of available cytoplasmic $60S$ subunits.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and primary defect in protein synthesis is that translation initiation proceeds to a $48S$ complex, but joining of the $60S$ subunit to form an $80S$ ribosome is blocked, preventing elongation. This corresponds to option D. The other options are inconsistent with the mechanism: ongoing cytoplasmic $80S$ ribosomes do not immediately stall (B), $40S$ binding to the 5' cap is unaffected (C), synthesis of ribosomal proteins is not the first process to halt (A), and free amino acids will not rapidly increase immediately because active elongation continues until termination (E).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2064948"}, {"introduction": "Viruses are masters of cellular manipulation, often evolving sophisticated mechanisms to hijack host machinery for their own replication. This problem presents a classic case of cellular warfare, where a mycovirus targets the host's translation apparatus [@problem_id:2064966]. By dissecting the viral strategy of cleaving a key initiation factor, you will contrast the canonical cap-dependent translation of the host with the virus's clever cap-independent mechanism, deepening your insight into the regulation of protein synthesis.", "problem": "In a laboratory study, a culture of the fungus *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* is infected with a newly discovered mycovirus. The cellular machinery of this fungus, like other eukaryotes, primarily initiates protein synthesis through a cap-dependent mechanism. This process relies on the formation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex at the 5' cap of messenger RNA (mRNA). A crucial component of this complex is the large scaffolding protein, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), which connects the cap-binding protein (eIF4E) to the $40S$ ribosomal subunit via other factors.\n\nFurther analysis reveals that the infecting mycovirus employs a sophisticated strategy to commandeer the host's resources. The virus expresses a highly specific protease that cleaves the host's eIF4G protein into two fragments. The N-terminal fragment, which normally binds eIF4E, is separated from the C-terminal fragment. The viral mRNA itself does not possess a 5' cap. Instead, it contains a complex, highly structured sequence known as an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES). This viral IRES is capable of directly recruiting the C-terminal fragment of the cleaved eIF4G, which in turn is sufficient to recruit the $40S$ ribosomal subunit and initiate translation of the viral genome.\n\nBased on this mechanism of viral takeover, what is the most probable consequence for global protein synthesis within an infected fungal cell?\n\nA. Both host and viral protein synthesis will be completely inhibited due to the degradation of a key translation factor.\nB. Host protein synthesis will be severely inhibited, while viral protein synthesis will proceed efficiently, potentially at an enhanced rate.\nC. Viral protein synthesis will be inhibited because its IRES requires the intact, full-length eIF4G protein to function.\nD. Both host and viral protein synthesis will continue, but at equally reduced rates, as they now compete for the limited pool of cleaved eIF4G fragments.\nE. Host protein synthesis will be stimulated to mount an antiviral response, while viral protein synthesis is outcompeted.", "solution": "The cap-dependent initiation mechanism in eukaryotes requires assembly of the eIF4F complex at the 5' cap of host mRNAs. In this complex, eIF4G serves as a scaffold that simultaneously binds eIF4E (cap-binding) via its N-terminal region and eIF3/$40S$ ribosomal subunit via its C-terminal region. Therefore, intact eIF4G is necessary to bridge capped mRNA to the ribosome for host translation initiation.\n\nThe viral protease cleaves eIF4G into an N-terminal fragment (retaining eIF4E binding) and a C-terminal fragment (retaining eIF3/$40S$ recruitment). After cleavage, capped host mRNAs can still bind eIF4E, but they lose the physical link to the $40S$ subunit because the eIF4E-bound N-terminal eIF4G fragment is no longer connected to the C-terminal eIF3/$40S$-recruiting region. Thus, host cap-dependent initiation is severely inhibited.\n\nThe viral mRNA is uncapped and contains an IRES that directly recruits the C-terminal fragment of eIF4G. This recruitment is sufficient to recruit eIF3 and the $40S$ subunit, allowing efficient initiation of viral translation independent of the 5' cap and eIF4E. Therefore, viral protein synthesis proceeds despite cleavage of eIF4G.\n\nAdditionally, host shutoff frees ribosomal subunits and other initiation/elongation factors from host mRNAs, reducing competition and potentially enhancing the efficiency of viral translation relative to the pre-infection state.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the factor is cleaved, not degraded, and the viral IRES exploits the C-terminal fragment to translate.\n- C is incorrect because the viral IRES specifically functions with the C-terminal eIF4G fragment, not the intact protein.\n- D is incorrect because host translation (cap-dependent) is disproportionately inhibited, while viral IRES-driven translation remains efficient.\n- E is incorrect because cleavage of eIF4G suppresses host translation rather than stimulating it.\n\nTherefore, the correct consequence is that host protein synthesis is severely inhibited while viral protein synthesis proceeds efficiently, potentially at an enhanced rate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2064966"}, {"introduction": "Modern molecular biology allows us to observe cellular processes with incredible precision, turning abstract concepts into concrete data.

For the purpose of data analysis, a ribosome's position is assigned to the single codon occupying its P-site. The specific pausing event occurs with the first codon of the pair, CCC, in the P-site.
