This problem [@problem_id:2094783] challenges you to think about the physical consequences of removing this protective layer. By analyzing the effects of osmotic pressure on a yeast protoplast, you'll gain a deeper appreciation for the cell wall's role in maintaining cellular integrity in hypotonic environments.", "problem": "A microbiologist is studying the properties of the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. In an experiment, a sample of yeast cells is treated with a combination of enzymes that completely and specifically digest the chitin, glucans, and mannoproteins that form their rigid cell walls, leaving the plasma membrane intact. These resulting structures, known as protoplasts, are then immediately transferred from an isotonic buffer solution into a beaker containing pure, distilled water. Assuming the plasma membrane remains perfectly semi-permeable (allowing water to pass but not solutes), which of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate fate of these yeast protoplasts?\n\nA. The protoplasts will shrivel as essential solutes leak out through the destabilized plasma membrane.\n\nB. The protoplasts will rapidly swell with water and ultimately burst.\n\nC. The protoplasts will remain unchanged in size and shape, as the plasma membrane actively regulates internal water volume.\n\nD. The protoplasts will begin to actively pump water out of the cytoplasm to counteract the influx, consuming cellular energy.\n\nE. The protoplasts will quickly synthesize a new cell wall, preventing any significant change in volume.", "solution": "We model the protoplast as a compartment bounded by a perfectly semi-permeable plasma membrane that allows water to pass but not solutes. Let the intracellular solute concentration be $C_{\\text{in}} > 0$ and the extracellular solute concentration in distilled water be $C_{\\text{out}} = 0$. The van 't Hoff relation gives the osmotic pressure for an ideal dilute solution as\n$$\n\\Pi = i R T C,\n$$\nwhere $i$ is the van ’t Hoff factor, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Therefore, the osmotic pressure difference across the membrane immediately after transfer to distilled water is\n$$\n\\Delta \\Pi = \\Pi_{\\text{in}} - \\Pi_{\\text{out}} = i R T \\left(C_{\\text{in}} - C_{\\text{out}}\\right) = i R T C_{\\text{in}} > 0.\n$$\nBecause the membrane is semi-permeable to water, water will move in the direction that reduces the difference in water chemical potential, equivalently down the water potential gradient. In terms of pressures, water influx continues until the hydrostatic pressure difference $\\Delta P$ across the membrane balances the osmotic pressure difference, i.e.,\n$$\n\\Delta P = \\Delta \\Pi.\n$$\nIn a cell lacking a rigid wall, the only mechanical resistance is the membrane tension. For a roughly spherical protoplast, the mechanical balance between membrane tension $\\gamma$ and the transmembrane hydrostatic pressure is given by the Laplace relation\n$$\n\\Delta P = \\frac{2 \\gamma}{r},\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the cell radius. To halt osmotic influx without a wall, the membrane would need to sustain a tension $\\gamma = \\frac{r}{2} \\Delta \\Pi$. However, biological lipid bilayers have a finite critical tension $\\gamma_{c}$ beyond which they rupture. For typical intracellular solute concentrations (so that $i R T C_{\\text{in}}$ is substantial), the required $\\Delta P$ to balance $\\Delta \\Pi$ exceeds what a naked plasma membrane can support before failure, so the membrane will stretch only slightly, the volume will rapidly increase, and the bilayer will rupture (osmotic lysis) before a stable mechanical equilibrium is achieved.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the membrane is specified to remain intact and semi-permeable to water only, so essential solutes do not immediately leak out.\n- C is incorrect because the plasma membrane does not actively regulate water volume; water flux is passive under the given conditions.\n- D is incorrect because cells do not possess active pumps that expel water directly; while they can pump ions, immediate compensation in pure water is not feasible and would not prevent the rapid influx.\n- E is incorrect because new cell wall synthesis is not immediate, and the osmotic imbalance would cause lysis before protective structures could be reassembled.\n\nTherefore, the immediate fate is rapid swelling with water and bursting due to osmotic lysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2094783"}, {"introduction": "Eukaryotic cells possess a sophisticated internal \"postal system\" to ensure proteins are delivered to their correct destinations within the endomembrane system. This exercise [@problem_id:2094769] explores the consequences of a breakdown in this system, focusing on the journey of the enzyme carboxypeptidase Y (CPY). By predicting where CPY ends up when its sorting receptor fails, you will clarify your understanding of the trans-Golgi Network's role as a major sorting hub and the concept of a default secretory pathway.", "problem": "In the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, the soluble hydrolytic enzyme carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) is synthesized and ultimately targeted to the cell's main degradative organelle, the vacuole (the functional equivalent of the lysosome in animal cells). This sorting process is mediated by a specific receptor protein, Vps10, which resides in the trans-Golgi Network (TGN). Vps10 recognizes a specific signal on CPY, binds to it, and ensures its packaging into transport vesicles destined for the vacuole.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of yeast that harbors a specific loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the Vps10 receptor. This mutation completely abolishes the ability of the Vps10 protein to bind its cargo, CPY, but does not affect the synthesis, folding, or transit of CPY through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Given this scenario, in which of the following locations would you expect to find the majority of the mature, active CPY in this mutant strain?\n\nA. The vacuole\n\nB. The extracellular space\n\nC. The cytoplasm\n\nD. The endoplasmic reticulum\n\nE. The mitochondrial matrix", "solution": "1. CPY is a soluble luminal hydrolase synthesized with an N-terminal signal sequence that directs its cotranslational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. It then transits through the Golgi apparatus as a luminal cargo protein. This establishes that CPY is not cytosolic and not mitochondrial, and that it normally moves forward through the secretory pathway.\n\n2. In wild-type cells, the vacuolar sorting receptor Vps10, located in the trans-Golgi network, recognizes a specific sorting signal on CPY. By receptor-ligand binding, Vps10 concentrates CPY into clathrin-coated vesicles destined for the endosome and then the vacuole. Delivery to the vacuole enables proteolytic processing of pro-CPY to the mature, active enzyme. This step depends on successful receptor-mediated sorting.\n\n3. In the mutant described, the Vps10 loss-of-function specifically abolishes cargo binding to CPY while leaving CPY synthesis, folding, and forward trafficking through ER and Golgi intact. The key principle is that in the absence of receptor capture in the TGN, soluble luminal cargo follows the default constitutive secretory pathway to the cell surface. Therefore, CPY will not be efficiently packaged into vesicles destined for the endosome-vacuole route and will instead be secreted out of the cell.\n\n4. Among the listed locations, this predicts that the majority of CPY will be found outside the cell. The vacuole will lack most CPY because sorting is impaired; the cytoplasm is not a location for a protein that enters the ER lumen; the ER is not an endpoint because forward transport is intact; and the mitochondrial matrix is unrelated to the secretory pathway and lacks targeting signals for CPY.\n\n5. Note on the term mature, active: Biochemically, CPY maturation typically occurs in the vacuole via proteolytic processing, so missorted CPY secreted outside the cell may not be fully matured as in the vacuole. However, the core trafficking prediction remains that the bulk of CPY protein will be secreted to the extracellular space when Vps10-mediated sorting is abolished. Thus, from the given options, the correct location for the majority of CPY in this mutant is the extracellular space.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2094769"}, {"introduction": "Organelles are not just passive bags of enzymes; they are highly controlled microenvironments tailored for specific biochemical tasks. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2094801] investigates the crucial role of pH in the function of a protozoan's lysosome. By considering a mutation that disables the proton pump responsible for acidifying this organelle, you will explore the direct link between an organelle's molecular machinery and its ability to perform its essential function—in this case, digesting food.", "problem": "Imagine a species of free-living protozoan that feeds by engulfing bacteria through phagocytosis. This process results in the formation of a food vacuole (phagosome) which then fuses with a lysosome to form a phagolysosome, where digestion occurs. Researchers create a mutant strain of this protozoan in which the gene encoding the vacuolar $\\text{H}^+$-ATPase (V-ATPase) proton pump is non-functional. These pumps are normally located on the lysosomal membrane and are responsible for its internal environment. What would be the most direct and significant consequence for the protozoan's ability to process an engulfed bacterium?\n\nA. The phagosome will be unable to fuse with the lysosome, preventing the delivery of digestive enzymes to the bacterium.\n\nB. The engulfed bacterium will not be effectively digested because the lysosomal enzymes will be largely inactive.\n\nC. The protozoan will be unable to absorb any nutrients from the bacterium because the transport proteins in the phagolysosomal membrane are deactivated.\n\nD. The bacterium will be digested much faster than normal, as the digestive enzymes are more potent at a neutral pH.\n\nE. The initial process of phagocytosis will fail, and the protozoan will be unable to engulf the bacterium.", "solution": "We identify the role of the vacuolar $\\text{H}^+$-ATPase (V-ATPase) on lysosomal membranes: it uses ATP hydrolysis to pump $\\text{H}^+$ into the lysosomal lumen, creating and maintaining an acidic pH. The key biological principle is that lysosomal acid hydrolases (proteases, nucleases, lipases, glycosidases, phosphatases) require a low pH for optimal catalytic activity; their activity decreases markedly near neutral pH.\n\nWe analyze the consequences of a non-functional V-ATPase:\n1. Without proton pumping, the lysosomal lumen will not acidify effectively. Therefore, the phagolysosome formed after fusion with the phagosome will have an abnormally elevated pH.\n2. Acid hydrolases in the lysosome are adapted to low pH; at higher pH their catalytic rates are greatly reduced. Thus, digestion of engulfed bacteria inside the phagolysosome will be inefficient or fail.\n3. Fusion machinery for phagosome-lysosome fusion (e.g., Rab GTPases, SNAREs) does not require V-ATPase activity directly; fusion can still occur in the absence of acidification. Therefore, failure of fusion is not the most direct consequence.\n4. Initial phagocytosis (engulfment) involves actin dynamics and membrane remodeling, which does not depend on lysosomal acidification, so engulfment itself should proceed.\n5. While some nutrient export from the phagolysosome can be driven by proton gradients via secondary active transporters, the most direct and significant defect arises upstream: the enzymes cannot digest macromolecules effectively without acidification, so little to no digestible monomers are produced in the first place. Hence, the predominant effect is impaired digestion due to enzyme inactivity, not primarily transporter deactivation.\n6. Digestive enzymes are not more potent at neutral pH; they are less active, so digestion would be slower, not faster.\n\nFrom these principles, the most direct and significant consequence is that the lysosomal enzymes will be largely inactive, and the engulfed bacterium will not be effectively digested.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2094801"}]}
