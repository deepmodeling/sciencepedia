This exercise [@problem_id:2104210] offers a fundamental application of this theory, allowing you to directly connect the total count of protein subunits in a capsid to its defining $T$ number.", "problem": "In a molecular virology laboratory, a newly discovered virus is being characterized. High-resolution cryo-electron microscopy reveals that the virus possesses a perfectly icosahedral capsid. According to the principles of quasi-equivalence described by the Caspar-Klug theory, such capsids are constructed from protein subunits arranged into pentamers and hexamers. The specific geometry and size of any icosahedral capsid can be described by an integer called the triangulation number, denoted by $T$. Biochemical analysis of the purified viral particles determines that the complete capsid is composed of exactly 180 identical protein subunits.\n\nCalculate the triangulation number, $T$, for this newly discovered virus.", "solution": "The problem asks for the triangulation number, $T$, of an icosahedral virus capsid that is composed of a known total number of protein subunits, $N$.\n\nAccording to the Caspar-Klug theory of viral capsid architecture, the total number of subunits, $N$, required to form a closed icosahedral shell with a triangulation number $T$ is given by the formula:\n$$N = 60T$$\n\nThis formula arises from the geometric constraints of building a 'quasi-equivalent' icosahedral lattice. An icosahedron has 12 vertices, each with five-fold rotational symmetry. In a viral capsid, these 12 vertices are always occupied by pentamers (a cluster of 5 protein subunits). This accounts for $12 \\times 5 = 60$ subunits. These 60 subunits are sufficient to form the simplest icosahedral capsid, which has a triangulation number $T=1$.\n\nTo construct larger and more complex capsids with $T > 1$, hexamers (clusters of 6 protein subunits) are inserted systematically onto the faces of the underlying icosahedron. The number of hexamers required for a capsid of a given triangulation number $T$ is $10(T-1)$.\n\nWe can verify the primary formula, $N=60T$, by summing the subunits from both pentamers and hexamers:\n$$N = (\\text{Number of pentamers} \\times 5) + (\\text{Number of hexamers} \\times 6)$$\nSince the number of pentamers is always 12 and the number of hexamers is $10(T-1)$:\n$$N = (12 \\times 5) + (10(T-1) \\times 6)$$\n$$N = 60 + 60(T-1)$$\n$$N = 60 + 60T - 60$$\n$$N = 60T$$\nThis confirms the direct relationship between the total number of subunits and the triangulation number.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the total number of protein subunits is $N = 180$. We can use the derived formula to solve for $T$:\n$$180 = 60T$$\nTo find $T$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$T = \\frac{180}{60}$$\n$$T = 3$$\n\nTherefore, the triangulation number for the virus is 3. A $T=3$ capsid is composed of 12 pentamers and $10(3-1) = 20$ hexamers. The total subunit count is $(12 \\times 5) + (20 \\times 6) = 60 + 120 = 180$, which is consistent with the information provided in the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2104210"}, {"introduction": "The formation of a specific viral shape, like an icosahedron, depends entirely on the way its protein subunits interact and assemble into larger structural units called capsomeres. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2104214] challenges you to predict the morphological consequences when a virus can no longer form the pentameric and hexameric capsomeres required for icosahedral symmetry. By exploring this hypothetical scenario, you will gain a deeper understanding of why helical symmetry represents a fundamental and alternative pathway for viral self-assembly.", "problem": "A virologist is studying a hypothetical, non-enveloped virus that typically assembles an icosahedral capsid. The capsid is constructed from a single type of protein subunit, the protomer. These protomers normally oligomerize to form two types of structural units called capsomeres: pentamers (pentons), which consist of five protomers, and hexamers (hexons), which consist of six protomers. These capsomeres then assemble into a closed, 20-sided icosahedral shell that encapsulates the viral nucleic acid.\n\nA critical mutation is introduced into the gene encoding the protomer. This mutation alters the protein's tertiary structure such that it can no longer form the specific inter-protomer contacts required to create either pentameric or hexameric capsomeres. However, the mutated protomers retain their intrinsic ability to bind to each other in a simpler, repetitive fashion and to bind to the viral nucleic acid.\n\nAssuming the virus still attempts to assemble a regular, encapsulating structure around its genome, which of the following morphologies would be the most probable outcome of the assembly process given this specific mutation?\n\nA. A complex morphology, featuring a distinct head and a tail structure.\n\nB. A smaller, but still geometrically perfect, icosahedral capsid.\n\nC. A helical morphology.\n\nD. An amorphous, pleomorphic structure lacking any discernible symmetry.\n\nE. A flat, two-dimensional crystalline sheet of protomers.", "solution": "We start from the architectural constraint for closed icosahedral shells built from identical subunits arranged in a quasi-equivalent hexagonal lattice on a sphere. By Euler’s polyhedron formula,\n$$\nV-E+F=2,\n$$\nand the topology of a closed spherical shell composed of polygons enforces the presence of curvature-inducing fivefold vertices. In the language of viral capsids, this implies that any icosahedral capsid built from hexagon-like local coordination requires exactly twelve pentameric sites. This is captured by the invariant\n$$\nN_{5}=12,\n$$\nwhere $N_{5}$ denotes the number of pentamers, while the remaining local coordinations are hexameric. Accordingly, assembly of a closed icosahedral shell demands that the protomer realize specific inter-protomer interfaces corresponding to pentameric and hexameric capsomeres.\n\nThe mutation described eliminates precisely these specific inter-protomer contacts needed to form either pentamers or hexamers. Therefore, the necessary local coordination states for icosahedral curvature (fivefold for positive Gaussian curvature and sixfold for near-planar tiling) cannot be achieved. As a result, options that still rely on these discrete capsomeres are excluded:\n- A smaller but geometrically perfect icosahedron (option B) still requires $N_{5}=12$ and compatible hexameric interfaces; it is therefore not possible.\n- A complex head-tail morphology (option A) typically requires multiple distinct protein types and dedicated assembly pathways; it is not a plausible emergent outcome from a single mutated protomer lacking the needed specific interfaces.\n\nThe problem further specifies that the mutated protomer retains (i) intrinsic subunit-subunit binding in a simpler, repetitive fashion and (ii) binding to the viral nucleic acid, and that the system still attempts to assemble a regular, encapsulating structure. Under these constraints, the most generic symmetry available to identical subunits using a single, repeated interface is helical symmetry, characterized by a screw operation with a constant rotation per subunit $\\theta$ and axial rise $h$:\n$$\nS(\\theta,h): \\text{ rotate by } \\theta \\text{ and translate by } h \\text{ per protomer addition.}\n$$\nHelical assemblies naturally arise from identical, quasi-one-dimensional repetitive interactions and readily form regular, closed (end-capped or continuous) nucleocapsids around a nucleic acid, as the polymeric protein can follow and stabilize the genome via simultaneous protein-protein and protein-genome contacts. This does not require the formation of discrete pentameric or hexameric capsomeres and is the canonical alternative to icosahedral assembly for single-subunit systems with simple repetitive binding.\n\nThe remaining options are inconsistent with the stated constraints:\n- An amorphous, pleomorphic aggregate (option D) would be likely if regularity were not maintained, but the problem stipulates a continued attempt to form a regular encapsulating structure with preserved repetitive binding.\n- A flat two-dimensional crystalline sheet (option E) could occur from identical planar contacts, but such a sheet would not encapsulate the genome into a regular closed shell, contradicting the assembly goal of encapsulation.\n\nTherefore, the most probable morphology under the given mutation and constraints is helical.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2104214"}, {"introduction": "While the principles of self-assembly are powerful, the construction of large and complex viral capsids often requires additional molecular machinery to ensure accuracy and prevent errors. Many viruses utilize non-structural scaffolding proteins that act as a temporary guide or template for the correct formation of the procapsid shell.

This phage possesses a complex morphology, consisting of an icosahedral head and a contractile tail. The assembly of the phage head requires the formation of an initial protein shell called a procapsid. This process is critically dependent on a non-structural protein known as the internal scaffolding protein, which acts as a temporary framework to guide the correct polymerization of the major capsid protein subunits.\n\nThe virologist creates a mutant strain of Phage-Σ1 through genetic engineering. This mutation results in a complete deletion of the gene encoding the internal scaffolding protein. The mutant phage is then used to infect a culture of susceptible *E. coli*. After allowing sufficient time for phage replication and subsequent cell lysis, the resulting lysate is collected and analyzed using electron microscopy to observe the morphological structures produced.\n\nBased on the known function of internal scaffolding proteins in the assembly of icosahedral viral capsids, which of the following outcomes would be the most predominantly observed feature in the lysate from the mutant phage infection?\n\nA. Normal, infectious Phage-Σ1 virions, but with the total count being significantly lower than in a wild-type infection.\n\nB.

Perfectly formed but empty procapsids that are incapable of packaging the viral genome, alongside normally assembled tail structures.\n\nE. A chaotic mixture of both helical and icosahedral capsid structures, indicating a loss of morphological specificity.", "solution": "1) State the biological principle: Internal scaffolding proteins are non-structural assembly factors that transiently template the correct curvature, size, and quasi-equivalent geometry of icosahedral procapsids. They promote proper polymerization and prevent off-pathway self-assembly of the major capsid protein.\n\n2) Predict the consequence of deleting the scaffolding gene: Without the internal scaffolding protein, the major capsid protein can still self-assemble, but it lacks the geometric guidance needed to form correctly sized and shaped procapsids. This typically leads to off-pathway products, including elongated tubular structures (polyheads), spirals, and small or misshapen shells, rather than properly formed procapsids.\n\n3) Evaluate each option against the expected phenotype:\n- A: Normal infectious virions at lower yield is inconsistent; the absence of scaffolding prevents correct capsid assembly, so infectious particles are not produced simply at reduced numbers; instead, misassembly predominates.\n- B: Only free genomes and unassembled subunits is unlikely; capsid proteins have intrinsic assembly propensity and, without scaffolding, tend to misassemble rather than remain entirely unassembled.\n- C: A large number of aberrant, non-functional head-related structures (e.g., polyheads and small/misshapen capsids) matches the known phenotype of scaffolding-deficient icosahedral capsid assembly, where coat protein polymerizes incorrectly.\n- D: Perfectly formed but empty procapsids require scaffolding; in its absence, properly formed procapsids are not produced. The empty-but-perfect procapsid phenotype is characteristic of defects in DNA packaging machinery, not scaffolding deletion.\n- E: A mixture of helical and icosahedral capsids indicating a loss of symmetry specificity is not typical; coat proteins remain constrained by their intrinsic interaction geometry. While tubular polyheads may appear, this reflects aberrant head-related assemblies rather than true helical capsid morphogenesis of a distinct symmetry class.\n\n4) Conclusion: The predominant observed feature is the accumulation of aberrant head-related assemblies (polyheads, misshapen/smaller capsids), consistent with loss of scaffolding-mediated templating.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2104247"}]}
