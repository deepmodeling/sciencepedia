A researcher isolates one of these flagellar filaments for analysis and measures its total length, $L$, to be 15 micrometers and its diameter to be 20 nanometers. The filament is a helical polymer constructed from a single protein subunit called flagellin. Structural studies have determined that each flagellin subunit adds approximately $l = 5$ nanometers to the growing length of the filament.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the total number of flagellin subunits required to assemble the full length of a single 15-micrometer filament. Provide your answer as a single integer.", "solution": "The number of subunits is the total filament length divided by the length added per subunit. Let $N$ be the number of subunits, $L$ the total length, and $l$ the length per subunit. Then\n$$\nN = \\frac{L}{l}.\n$$\nConvert the total length to consistent units.

This thought experiment challenges you to consider *why* the flagellar filament has a helical shape by imagining what would happen if it were a straight, rigid rod. By analyzing this hypothetical scenario, you can deduce the fundamental physical principles that allow the rotating filament to generate thrust and propel a bacterium through a fluid. [@problem_id:2066716]", "problem": "A team of bioengineers is studying bacterial motility. They perform a genetic experiment on a species of motile bacteria, altering the gene that codes for the flagellin protein. The new, engineered flagellin subunits polymerize to form a flagellar filament that is perfectly straight and rigid, like a solid needle, instead of its normal semi-rigid helical structure. The flagellar motor within the basal body remains fully functional, capable of rotating this modified filament at the same speed as a normal one.\n\nAssuming the assembly of the rest of the flagellar apparatus (basal body, hook, etc.) is unaffected, what is the most likely consequence of this modification on the bacterium's motility?\n\nA. The bacterium will become effectively non-motile, capable only of spinning or wobbling in place without significant directional movement.\nB. The bacterium's swimming speed will increase because the rigid filament generates more powerful thrust than a flexible one.\nC.

The bacterium will be trapped in a permanent \"running\" state, unable to perform the \"tumbles\" necessary to change direction.\nE. Motility will be normal for bacteria with a single polar flagellum (monotrichous), but it will be lost for bacteria with multiple flagella (peritrichous).", "solution": "The problem asks for the consequence of replacing a bacterium's normal helical flagellar filament with a straight, rigid rod, while the motor remains functional. To solve this, we must understand the fundamental mechanism of flagellar propulsion.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Normal Flagellar Propulsion**\nBacterial motility is achieved by the rotation of the flagellar filament, which acts as a propeller. The filament is not a random, flexible string; it is a semi-rigid, helical (corkscrew-shaped) structure. The basal body acts as a rotary motor, embedded in the cell membrane. This motor imparts a rotation to the filament via the hook, a flexible universal joint. When the helical filament rotates, it pushes against the surrounding fluid medium, much like a screw turning in wood or a boat's propeller pushing against water. This interaction generates an axial thrust along the filament's axis, propelling the cell body forward (a \"run\") or pulling it backward.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Modified Flagellum**\nIn the modified bacterium, the helical filament is replaced by a perfectly straight, rigid rod. The motor still rotates this rod.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Principles of Fluid Dynamics**\nWe must consider how a rotating straight rod interacts with a fluid. A smooth, symmetric cylinder or rod rotating about its long axis will primarily just stir the fluid around it. Due to its axial symmetry, it does not create a differential pressure along its length and therefore fails to generate any significant net axial thrust. The forces exerted on the fluid are perpendicular to the axis of rotation, creating a vortex or shear in the fluid, but there is no net force component that would push or pull the cell body in a directional manner.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Consequences and the Options**\n\n*   **Consequence for Motility:** Since the rotating rigid rod cannot generate thrust, the bacterium cannot be propelled through the medium. The rotation of the rod will cause a counter-rotation in the cell body due to conservation of angular momentum. The net result is that the entire bacterium will simply spin or wobble in place, tethered by the ineffective flagellum. It is rendered effectively non-motile.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Option A:** \"The bacterium will become effectively non-motile, capable only of spinning or wobbling in place without significant directional movement.\" This aligns perfectly with our analysis. The lack of thrust generation prevents propulsion.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Option B:** \"The bacterium's swimming speed will increase because the rigid filament generates more powerful thrust than a flexible one.\" This is incorrect. The helical shape, not rigidity alone, is what is critical for generating thrust. A rigid rod is an extremely inefficient propeller.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Option C:** \"The bacterium will only be able to move backward (\"reverse\" motility) but will be unable to move forward.\" This is incorrect. A rotating rod is equally ineffective at generating thrust in either direction. The physics of the interaction does not support unidirectional motion.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Option D:** \"The bacterium will be trapped in a permanent \"running\" state, unable to perform the \"tumbles\" necessary to change direction.\" This is incorrect. The bacterium cannot perform a \"run\" in the first place because it cannot generate forward thrust. Therefore, it is not \"trapped\" in this state.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Option E:** \"Motility will be normal for bacteria with a single polar flagellum (monotrichous), but it will be lost for bacteria with multiple flagella (peritrichous).\" This is incorrect. The principle of propulsion failure applies regardless of the number or arrangement of flagella. A single rotating rod is just as ineffective as multiple rotating rods. The fundamental physics of the filament-fluid interaction is the same in both cases.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe helical shape of the flagellar filament is essential for its function as a propeller. Replacing it with a straight, rigid rod eliminates the mechanism for generating axial thrust. Consequently, the bacterium loses its ability for directional movement and is rendered non-motile. The correct option is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2066716"}, {"introduction": "A powerful motor is only effective if it is securely mounted to its chassis. In a bacterium, the flagellar motor must be stably anchored within the multi-layered cell envelope to transmit torque efficiently. This final practice compares two scenarios that compromise this anchoring, forcing you to connect the function of specific basal body components to the overall integrity of the Gram-negative cell wall. [@problem_id:2066719]", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating the motility of the Gram-negative bacterium *Escherichia coli* (*E. coli*). The motility of wild-type *E. coli* is conferred by a rotating flagellum, which is anchored in the cell envelope by a complex protein structure called the basal body. In Gram-negative bacteria, this basal body includes four rings: the L-ring (associates with the outer lipopolysaccharide layer), the P-ring (associates with the peptidoglycan layer), and the MS- and C-rings (associated with the cytoplasmic membrane and cytoplasm, respectively).\n\nThe microbiologist creates two different mutant strains for a comparative study. Both strains are cultured in a standard, hypotonic nutrient broth.\n\n- **Strain 1:** This strain is genetically engineered to produce flagella that completely lack the L- and P-rings, but all other flagellar components, including the motor proteins, are produced and assembled normally.\n- **Strain 2:** This strain is a wild-type *E. coli* that is cultured in a medium containing an antibiotic that specifically and completely inhibits the synthesis of peptidoglycan. The bacterium's ability to synthesize flagellar proteins is unaffected.\n\nBased on your understanding of bacterial cell structure and flagellar function, predict the motility phenotypes of these two strains. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate comparison and explanation?\n\nA. Both Strain 1 and Strain 2 will be non-motile because in both scenarios, the flagellar rod is not stably anchored within the cell envelope, preventing effective torque transmission and rotation.\nB. Strain 1 will be non-motile due to the missing rings, but Strain 2 will be fully motile because all its native flagellar components are present.\nC. Both strains will be motile, as the MS- and C-rings are sufficient to anchor the flagellum and drive rotation.\nD. Strain 1 will be motile, but Strain 2 will be non-motile because the lack of a peptidoglycan layer will cause the cell to lyse.\nE. Both strains will exhibit significantly reduced, or \"wobbly,\" motility, but will not be completely non-motile.", "solution": "First, recall the structural and functional roles of the flagellar basal body in Gram-negative bacteria. The L-ring resides in the outer membrane/lipopolysaccharide layer and the P-ring in the peptidoglycan layer; together they act as bushings that stabilize the rotating rod as it traverses the periplasm and outer envelope. The MS-ring is embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane and the C-ring is cytoplasmic; these form the rotor-stator machinery that generates torque. Effective motility requires stable alignment and support of the rod across all envelope layers so that torque from the motor is transmitted to the external filament without excessive friction or misalignment.\n\nFor Strain 1, the engineered deletion of both L- and P-rings removes the periplasmic and outer-envelope bushings. In a Gram-negative cell, the rod must pass through the periplasm, the peptidoglycan, and the outer membrane. Without the L- and P-rings, the rod is not stably supported in these layers, leading to excessive wobble, friction, misalignment, and likely shearing or failure of effective rotation. Although the MS- and C-rings and motor proteins are present and can generate torque, the absence of the L- and P-rings prevents proper torque transmission to the external filament. Therefore, Strain 1 is non-motile.\n\nFor Strain 2, peptidoglycan synthesis is specifically and completely inhibited. In actively growing Gram-negative cells, inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis compromises the integrity of the cell wall, and in a hypotonic medium, the rigid peptidoglycan layer is required to withstand turgor pressure. Loss of peptidoglycan leads to osmotic lysis of the cell. Independently of lysis, the P-ring requires an intact peptidoglycan layer for anchoring; thus, even before lysis, the basal body is not stably supported across the envelope. Consequently, Strain 2 will also be non-motile, with the dominant outcome being rapid lysis under the stated conditions.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A correctly states that both strains are non-motile and attributes this to the lack of stable anchoring of the rod within the envelope, which is accurate for both the absence of L/P rings (Strain 1) and the loss of peptidoglycan support (Strain 2).\n- B is incorrect because Strain 2 will not remain fully motile; loss of peptidoglycan synthesis leads to destabilization of the P-ring and lysis in hypotonic conditions.\n- C is incorrect because the MS- and C-rings alone are insufficient to stably anchor the rod through the periplasm and outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria.\n- D is incorrect because Strain 1 will not be motile without the L- and P-rings.\n- E is incorrect because the expected phenotype is effectively non-motile rather than merely reduced or wobbly motility, given the critical structural defects and lysis.\n\nThus, the most accurate comparison and explanation is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2066719"}]}
