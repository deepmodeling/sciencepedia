This practice presents a scenario where a hypothetical antibiotic specifically targets and inhibits the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) within the 50S subunit.

Experimental analysis reveals that the antibiotic binds specifically to the 50S ribosomal subunit and completely inhibits the catalytic activity of its peptidyl transferase center. This center is known to be a ribozyme, with its function residing in the 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Assume that the treated bacterium attempts to synthesize a protein from a messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript. Which of the following statements describes the most immediate and direct consequence of the antibiotic's action on the translation elongation cycle?\n\nA. The 70S ribosome will fail to assemble, as the 50S subunit cannot bind to the 30S initiation complex.\n\nB. The ribosome will be unable to move or translocate to the next codon on the mRNA molecule.\n\nC. A charged aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) will be unable to bind to the A-site (aminoacyl site) of the ribosome.\n\nD. A peptide bond will not form between the amino acid carried by the tRNA in the A-site and the growing polypeptide chain attached to the tRNA in the P-site (peptidyl site).\n\nE. The uncharged tRNA in the P-site (peptidyl site) will not be released from the E-site (exit site).", "solution": "The peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of the prokaryotic ribosome is a ribozyme located within the 23S rRNA of the 50S subunit. Its catalytic role in the elongation cycle is to mediate the peptidyl transfer reaction, in which the alpha-amino group of the aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester linkage connecting the growing polypeptide to the peptidyl-tRNA in the P site. This results in formation of a new peptide bond and transfer of the nascent chain to the A-site tRNA.\n\nThe elongation cycle proceeds, in order, through:\n1) Selection and accommodation of an aminoacyl-tRNA into the A site, which depends on correct codon-anticodon pairing at the decoding center of the 30S subunit and EF-Tu–GTP (in bacteria), not on the catalytic activity of the PTC.\n2) Peptidyl transfer, catalyzed by the PTC in the 50S subunit (23S rRNA).\n3) Translocation, driven by EF-G–GTP hydrolysis, moving the ribosome along the mRNA such that the peptidyl-tRNA shifts from the A site to the P site and the deacylated tRNA moves to the E site.\n4) Release of the deacylated tRNA from the E site.\n\nGiven that the antibiotic binds the 50S subunit and completely inhibits the catalytic activity of the PTC, the most immediate and direct consequence is the failure of the peptidyl transfer step. Specifically, the nucleophilic attack required for peptide bond formation cannot occur without the PTC’s catalytic contribution, so the peptide bond between the amino acid on the A-site tRNA and the growing chain on the P-site tRNA will not form.\n\nAssessment of the options:\n- A is incorrect because 70S initiation complex assembly involves 30S initiation complex formation and subsequent joining by the 50S subunit; inhibition of the PTC’s catalytic activity does not prevent subunit joining.\n- B is incorrect because translocation is a subsequent step driven by EF-G–GTP; while it cannot proceed properly without prior peptidyl transfer, this is not the immediate, direct target of PTC inhibition.\n- C is incorrect because A-site tRNA selection and initial binding are governed by the decoding center in the 30S subunit and EF-Tu, not by the catalytic activity of the PTC.\n- D is correct: without PTC activity, the peptide bond cannot form between the A-site aminoacyl-tRNA and the P-site peptidyl-tRNA.\n- E is incorrect because E-site release occurs after translocation and is not the immediate consequence of PTC inhibition.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and direct consequence is the failure of peptide bond formation during elongation, as described in option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2089942"}, {"introduction": "Protein synthesis is one of the most energy-intensive processes in a cell.

The synthesis of a polypeptide chain involves several stages, each with an associated cost in terms of GTP hydrolysis. The process is defined as follows:\n\n1.  **Initiation:** The assembly of the ribosomal subunits on the mRNA transcript, along with the initiator tRNA, requires the hydrolysis of one molecule of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP).\n2.  **Elongation Cycle (for each subsequent amino acid):**\n    a.  **Aminoacyl-tRNA Delivery:** An elongation factor delivers the correct aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome's A-site. This step is powered by the hydrolysis of one GTP molecule.\n    b.  **Translocation:** The ribosome advances one codon along the mRNA, a process that requires the hydrolysis of another GTP molecule.\n3.  **Termination:** The release of the completed polypeptide chain from the ribosome requires the hydrolysis of one final GTP molecule.\n4.  **Kinetic Proofreading:** To ensure high fidelity, the ribosome possesses a proofreading mechanism. For the specific polypeptide being modeled, it is observed that for every 50 correct aminoacyl-tRNAs that are successfully incorporated into the growing chain, one incorrect aminoacyl-tRNA is delivered to the A-site and subsequently rejected. This rejection process still consumes the energy from the delivery step, meaning one molecule of GTP is hydrolyzed for each rejected aminoacyl-tRNA.\n\nBased on this model, calculate the total average number of GTP molecules that are hydrolyzed to synthesize a single polypeptide that is exactly 100 amino acids long. Note that the energy required to charge tRNA molecules with their respective amino acids (which involves ATP hydrolysis) should not be included in your calculation.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of GTP molecules hydrolyzed to synthesize a polypeptide of 100 amino acids.
