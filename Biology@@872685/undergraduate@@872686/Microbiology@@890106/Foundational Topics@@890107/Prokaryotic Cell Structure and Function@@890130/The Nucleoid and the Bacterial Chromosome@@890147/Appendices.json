This first exercise challenges you to interpret a common but puzzling experimental result, bridging the gap between the textbook concept of a single bacterial chromosome and the real-world data from an agarose gel. By analyzing this scenario, you will explore how the physical shape, or topology, of a DNA molecule dramatically affects its behavior.", "problem": "An undergraduate researcher is studying the chromosome of the bacterium *Caulobacter crescentus*. It is known that this bacterium has a single, large, circular chromosome. The student carefully isolates the total chromosomal Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) from a pure culture, using a gentle lysis and purification protocol designed to minimize mechanical shearing of the DNA molecule. The purified DNA is then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, a standard laboratory technique that separates DNA molecules based on their migration through a gel matrix under an electric field. Contrary to the expectation of seeing a single band for the single chromosome, the student observes three distinct, well-defined bands in the gel lane. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate scientific explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The bacterial chromosome was in various stages of replication, resulting in molecules of one, two, and three times the genome size, which separated into different bands.\n\nB. The isolation process, despite being gentle, inevitably caused random fragmentation of the chromosome into a few large, linear pieces of different but specific sizes.\n\nC. The single circular DNA molecule can exist in different topological forms (topoisomers), such as supercoiled, relaxed, and nicked, which have different shapes and thus migrate at different speeds through the gel.\n\nD. The bacterium contains two additional large DNA molecules, known as megaplasmids, which are similar in size to the chromosome and were co-purified.\n\nE. The chromosome is composed of distinct domains of A-DNA, B-DNA, and Z-DNA, and these different structural forms of the DNA helix cause the molecule to separate into three bands.", "solution": "First, identify the physical nature of the DNA isolated. The bacterium has a single, large, circular chromosome. Under gentle lysis designed to avoid shearing, most chromosomal DNA remains intact as circular molecules rather than being converted into linear fragments.\n\nSecond, recall that covalently closed circular DNA exists in distinct topological states (topoisomers) defined by their linking number. In practical terms for agarose electrophoresis, three commonly observed forms are:\n- Supercoiled covalently closed circular DNA (highly compact).\n- Relaxed covalently closed circular DNA (less compact due to removal of superhelical turns by topoisomerases prior to isolation).\n- Nicked open circular DNA (a single-strand break removes superhelical tension, producing a floppy, least-compact circle).\n\nThird, apply the principle of agarose gel electrophoresis: migration depends on both size and shape. For DNA molecules of identical length, more compact conformations migrate faster through the gel matrix. Therefore, supercoiled DNA runs fastest (lowest apparent size), relaxed closed circular DNA runs more slowly, and nicked open circular DNA runs slowest. This yields multiple discrete bands from a single DNA species differing only in topology.\n\nFourth, evaluate and reject alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because ongoing replication produces theta intermediates rather than discrete molecules of exactly one, two, or three genome lengths; such structures often migrate anomalously or smear rather than forming three sharp bands.\n- B is unlikely under gentle, low-shear conditions; random fragmentation typically yields a smear or many bands, not three well-defined bands of reproducible mobility.\n- D is not the most accurate general explanation; while some bacteria carry plasmids, the observation of exactly three sharp bands from a pure culture of a bacterium known for a single chromosome is more parsimoniously explained by topoisomers; megaplasmids similar in size to the chromosome are uncommon and would require specific prior evidence.\n- E is incorrect because A-, B-, and Z-DNA are local helical conformations within the same molecule; they do not partition a single chromosome into separable species that resolve as distinct bands based solely on those local structures.\n\nThus, the most accurate explanation is that the single circular chromosome exists in different topological forms (topoisomers) that migrate differently, producing three distinct bands.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2099561"}, {"introduction": "Having established that bacterial chromosomes exist in different topological states, we now investigate the machinery responsible for creating and maintaining this structure [@problem_id:2099561]. This problem focuses on DNA gyrase, the enzyme that introduces the negative supercoils essential for compacting the chromosome into the nucleoid. Using the clinically relevant scenario of an antibiotic inhibitor, you will predict the structural fate of the nucleoid, deepening your understanding of how DNA compaction is actively controlled.", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating a novel antibiotic, Compound X, which has been shown to be a highly specific inhibitor of the bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase. DNA gyrase is a topoisomerase that is essential for maintaining the proper topology of the bacterial chromosome. The chromosome is organized within the cell in a condensed structure called the nucleoid, where the DNA is arranged into loops and supercoiled domains, stabilized by various proteins including Histone-like nucleoid-structuring (HU) proteins. The microbiologist treats a logarithmically growing culture of *Escherichia coli* with a lethal concentration of Compound X.\n\nWhat is the most immediate and primary effect of Compound X on the physical structure of the *E. coli* nucleoid?\n\nA. The chromosome will become hyper-condensed as compensatory supercoiling is introduced by other topoisomerases.\n\nB. The chromosome will decondense as the negative supercoils introduced by DNA gyrase are lost and not replaced.\n\nC. The chromosome will fragment into numerous small pieces due to the immense torsional stress created by the inhibition.\n\nD. The binding of HU proteins to the DNA will be completely blocked, leading to a rapid unfolding of the chromosome.\n\nE. The DNA strands will be permanently cross-linked, preventing both replication and transcription from occurring.", "solution": "DNA gyrase is a type II topoisomerase that uses ATP hydrolysis to introduce negative supercoils into bacterial DNA, thereby decreasing the linking number. The topology of closed (or constrained) DNA is described by the Călugăreanu-White-Fuller relation\n$$\nLk = Tw + Wr,\n$$\nwhere $Lk$ is the linking number, $Tw$ is the twist, and $Wr$ is the writhe. Supercoiling is quantified by the superhelical density\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{Lk - Lk_{0}}{Lk_{0}},\n$$\nwith $Lk_{0}$ being the relaxed linking number. In bacteria under normal growth, $\\sigma  0$ (negative supercoiling), which promotes plectonemic writhe and compaction of the nucleoid.\n\nAt steady state in logarithmic growth, the introduction of negative supercoils by DNA gyrase (which makes $\\Delta Lk  0$ per catalytic cycle) is balanced by the relaxation activity of topoisomerase I, which removes negative supercoils (increasing $Lk$ toward $Lk_{0}$). Denote the net rate of change of $Lk$ as\n$$\n\\frac{dLk}{dt} = r_{\\text{gyrase}} + r_{\\text{topoI}} + r_{\\text{other}},\n$$\nwhere $r_{\\text{gyrase}}  0$ (introduces negative supercoils) and $r_{\\text{topoI}}  0$ (relaxes negative supercoils). In steady state, $r_{\\text{gyrase}} + r_{\\text{topoI}} + r_{\\text{other}} \\approx 0$, giving a stable negative $\\sigma$ and a condensed nucleoid due to large $|Wr|$.\n\nUpon treatment with a lethal concentration of a highly specific DNA gyrase inhibitor (Compound X), the immediate effect is to set\n$$\nr_{\\text{gyrase}} \\to 0,\n$$\nwhile $r_{\\text{topoI}}  0$ persists. Consequently,\n$$\n\\frac{dLk}{dt} > 0,\\quad \\frac{d\\sigma}{dt} = \\frac{1}{Lk_{0}}\\frac{dLk}{dt} > 0,\n$$\ndriving $\\sigma \\to 0$ from an initially negative value. As $\\sigma$ approaches zero, negative supercoils are lost, $|Wr|$ decreases, plectonemic supercoils unwind, and the nucleoid physically decondenses. This decondensation is the most immediate and primary structural effect because no other bacterial topoisomerase routinely introduces negative supercoils to compensate; topoisomerase I instead removes them, and topoisomerase IV primarily decatenates without introducing negative supercoils.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because other topoisomerases do not compensate by introducing negative supercoils; instead, topoisomerase I relaxes them, opposing condensation.\n- B is correct: loss of gyrase activity causes loss of negative supercoils, reducing $|Wr|$ and decondensing the chromosome.\n- C is incorrect: inhibition of gyrase does not fragment DNA; fragmentation would require nucleolytic or chemically induced strand breaks.\n- D is incorrect: HU protein binding is not directly blocked by gyrase inhibition; any changes would be secondary to altered topology.\n- E is incorrect: permanent cross-linking is not a consequence of gyrase inhibition; that is characteristic of distinct agents such as bifunctional alkylating drugs.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and primary effect is decondensation due to loss of negative supercoils.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2099557"}, {"introduction": "The topological challenges of the bacterial chromosome extend beyond simple compaction. During cell division, the replicated chromosomes must be cleanly separated, a task requiring a different kind of topological enzyme than the one we just explored [@problem_id:2099557]. This final practice examines the critical role of Topoisomerase IV in decatenation, revealing the lethal consequences that arise when daughter chromosomes remain physically interlinked after replication is complete.", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating a novel antibiotic that specifically targets bacterial Topoisomerase IV, a crucial enzyme for chromosome segregation in many bacteria. To study its effect, the researcher uses a synchronized culture of *Escherichia coli*. The cells are allowed to complete one full round of chromosome replication in the presence of a concentration of the antibiotic that completely inhibits Topoisomerase IV activity. Assume that DNA gyrase activity, replication initiation and elongation, and the formation of the cytokinetic Z-ring are all unaffected by the drug.\n\nWhich of the following options most accurately describes the state of the bacterial chromosomes and the terminal cellular phenotype that would be observed after the cells attempt to undergo cytokinesis?\n\nA. The two replicated chromosomes will condense and segregate to opposite poles of the cell, but the Z-ring will fail to constrict, resulting in long, filamentous cells containing two well-separated, distinct nucleoids.\n\nB. The replication process will be unable to terminate correctly, leaving the two daughter chromosomes covalently joined at the terminus region. This results in a single, large U-shaped chromosome that prevents Z-ring formation and cell division, causing cells to arrest before any visible sign of cytokinesis.\n\nC. The two fully replicated, circular daughter chromosomes will remain topologically interlinked, forming a structure known as a catenane. As the Z-ring constricts at the mid-cell, it will be physically blocked by the trapped, unsegregated DNA, leading to a failed division and often resulting in chromosome breakage, which is a lethal event.\n\nD. The lack of Topoisomerase IV activity will cause excessive positive supercoiling ahead of the replication forks, leading to the collapse of the forks and incomplete replication. The cells will arrest with a single, partially replicated chromosome and eventually lyse.\n\nE. The cells will divide normally, but only one of the two daughter cells will receive a chromosome. The other daughter cell will be anucleate and non-viable, a phenotype known as chromosome mis-segregation.", "solution": "1) Define the specific role of Topoisomerase IV in bacteria. Topoisomerase IV is the primary decatenase in many bacteria, including Escherichia coli. Its essential functions after replication are to remove precatenanes that form behind replication forks and to decatenate the two circular daughter chromosomes at the completion of replication so that they can fully segregate. It can also resolve certain DNA knots. This activity is distinct from DNA gyrase, which primarily removes positive supercoils ahead of replication forks and introduces negative supercoils.\n\n2) Establish what processes are unaffected under the stated conditions. The problem specifies that DNA gyrase activity, replication initiation and elongation, and Z-ring formation are unaffected. Therefore, replication forks can progress, supercoiling ahead of forks is managed, replication completes, and the cytokinetic machinery can assemble at mid-cell.\n\n3) Predict the chromosome state at completion of replication when Topoisomerase IV is fully inhibited. With replication allowed to finish but no Topoisomerase IV activity, the two circular daughter chromosomes remain topologically interlinked as catenanes. The interlinks are non-covalent topological links, not covalent junctions at the terminus. Thus, termination can occur, but separation (decatenation) cannot.\n\n4) Predict the effect on segregation and cytokinesis. Because decatenation fails, the two chromosomes cannot fully segregate to opposite cell halves; DNA remains spanning the mid-cell region. The Z-ring can form, but as constriction initiates, the septum encounters unsegregated DNA. Nucleoid occlusion and the physical presence of DNA at the division plane impede constriction. The divisome may stall, or if constriction proceeds, the septum can sever DNA (chromosome guillotining), producing double-strand breaks and lethality.\n\n5) Evaluate options:\n- A: Claims segregation to poles occurs and Z-ring fails to constrict, yielding filamentous cells with two separated nucleoids. This contradicts the requirement for Topoisomerase IV in decatenation; full segregation cannot occur without it. Also, Z-ring formation is stated to be unaffected; the block is not an intrinsic failure to constrict but a physical impediment by trapped DNA.\n- B: Asserts a covalent joining of daughter chromosomes at the terminus yielding a U-shaped chromosome and complete prevention of Z-ring formation. This confuses topological catenation (Topo IV function) with covalent chromosome dimers resolved by XerCD at dif with assistance from FtsK; Topoisomerase IV inhibition does not create covalent junctions. Z-rings can form; the issue arises during constriction due to unsegregated DNA.\n- C: States that fully replicated chromosomes remain catenated; Z-ring constriction is blocked by trapped DNA at mid-cell, leading to failed division and often chromosome breakage, which is lethal. This matches the expected consequence of Topoisomerase IV inhibition with replication and Z-ring assembly intact.\n- D: Attributes excessive positive supercoiling and fork collapse to Topoisomerase IV loss. This is a function of DNA gyrase, which is specified to be unaffected; replication proceeds to completion.\n- E: Claims normal division with one anucleate daughter. While chromosome guillotining can produce anucleate cells, division is not expected to proceed normally; the septum is impeded by DNA and division typically fails or causes lethal DNA breakage rather than routinely yielding clean anucleate daughters.\n\n6) Conclusion. The mechanistic prediction precisely matches option C: catenated chromosomes block septal closure, frequently causing chromosome breakage and lethality.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2099553"}]}
