{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Determining an antibiotic's mechanism often begins with a broad question: does it stop protein synthesis before it even starts, or does it jam the machinery mid-process? This exercise guides you through a classic experimental design that uses two different types of mRNA to distinguish between inhibitors of translation initiation and elongation. By analyzing how a hypothetical antibiotic behaves in these two systems, you will learn a powerful method for pinpointing the stage of inhibition [@problem_id:2077734].", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating a newly discovered antibiotic, \"Novamycin,\" isolated from a soil bacterium. To determine its mechanism of action, the microbiologist uses a bacterial cell-free translation system. This system contains all the necessary components for protein synthesis: ribosomes, transfer RNAs (tRNAs), aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, initiation factors (IFs), elongation factors (EFs), and Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP). The experiment is designed to measure the incorporation of a radiolabeled amino acid, $^{3}\\text{H}$-phenylalanine, into polypeptides.\n\nTwo different types of messenger RNA (mRNA) are used in parallel experiments:\n1.  **Natural mRNA:** A standard bacterial mRNA containing a proper Shine-Dalgarno sequence and an AUG start codon, followed by a coding sequence rich in phenylalanine codons.\n2.  **Circular poly(U) mRNA:** A synthetic, circular mRNA consisting only of uracil nucleotides. This mRNA lacks a start codon and can only be translated efficiently when the magnesium ion concentration ($[\\text{Mg}^{2+}]$) is raised to a high level, which forces ribosomes to bind and begin translation without the standard initiation sequence or initiation factors.\n\nThe following observations are made:\n\n*   **Experiment 1:** In the presence of the natural mRNA and a normal $[\\text{Mg}^{2+}]$, the addition of Novamycin almost completely prevents the incorporation of $^{3}\\text{H}$-phenylalanine into protein.\n*   **Experiment 2:** In the presence of the circular poly(U) mRNA and a high $[\\text{Mg}^{2+}]$, robust incorporation of $^{3}\\text{H}$-phenylalanine is observed. When Novamycin is added to this system, there is no significant change in the level of $^{3}\\text{H}$-phenylalanine incorporation compared to the control without the antibiotic.\n\nBased on these experimental results, what is the most likely mechanism of action for Novamycin?\n\nA. It interferes with the formation of the 70S initiation complex.\n\nB. It blocks the peptidyl transferase activity of the large ribosomal subunit.\n\nC. It prevents the translocation of the ribosome along the mRNA.\n\nD. It induces misreading of the mRNA codons, leading to incorrect amino acid incorporation.\n\nE. It inhibits the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A-site.", "solution": "The experimental system measures translation by tracking incorporation of $^{3}\\text{H}$-phenylalanine. With natural mRNA under normal $[\\text{Mg}^{2+}]$, bacterial translation proceeds via canonical initiation: the 30S subunit, with $IF1$, $IF2 \\cdot GTP$, and $IF3$, pairs the Shine–Dalgarno sequence with 16S rRNA, recruits initiator $f\\text{Met-tRNA}^{f\\text{Met}}$ to the P-site to form the 30S initiation complex, then the 50S subunit joins to form the 70S initiation complex and elongation begins. This can be summarized as\n$$\n30\\mathrm{S} + \\text{IFs} + \\text{mRNA} + f\\text{Met-tRNA}^{f\\text{Met}} + \\text{GTP} \\rightarrow \\text{30S IC}, \\quad \\text{30S IC} + 50\\mathrm{S} \\rightarrow \\text{70S IC} \\rightarrow \\text{elongation}.\n$$\nIn Experiment 1, Novamycin almost completely prevents $^{3}\\text{H}$-phenylalanine incorporation with natural mRNA, indicating that an early step required for canonical initiation is blocked, preventing entry into elongation.\n\nThe circular poly(U) mRNA encodes only UUU codons, which specify phenylalanine, and under high $[\\text{Mg}^{2+}]$ ribosomes can bind and initiate translation without the standard initiation signals or initiation factors. This “factor-independent” initiation bypasses the need for the canonical 70S initiation complex assembly pathway. In Experiment 2, robust $^{3}\\text{H}$-phenylalanine incorporation occurs with poly(U) at high $[\\text{Mg}^{2+}]$ and is unaffected by Novamycin, demonstrating that the antibiotic’s target is not required under these forced initiation conditions.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- If Novamycin blocked peptidyl transferase activity (option B), prevented translocation (option C), or inhibited aminoacyl-tRNA A-site binding (option E), elongation would be impaired in both systems, including the poly(U) high $[\\text{Mg}^{2+}]$ condition; this contradicts Experiment 2.\n- If it induced misreading (option D), incorporation would not be abolished with natural mRNA and would likely still alter incorporation with poly(U); this does not fit the strong inhibition in Experiment 1 and the lack of effect in Experiment 2.\n- Interference with formation of the 70S initiation complex (option A) explains both observations: it abolishes translation with natural mRNA under normal initiation, but is bypassed when initiation is forced by high $[\\text{Mg}^{2+}]$ on circular poly(U), leaving elongation intact.\n\nTherefore, the most likely mechanism is interference with formation of the 70S initiation complex.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2077734"}, {"introduction": "Once an antibiotic is identified as an elongation inhibitor, the next step is to uncover its specific action. The ribosomal elongation cycle involves several key sites, and blocking any one of them can halt protein synthesis. This problem presents a scenario where a drug physically obstructs the ribosomal A-site, the crucial entry point for incoming aminoacyl-tRNAs, thereby preventing the polypeptide chain from growing [@problem_id:2077726]. Your task is to deduce which class of antibiotics operates through this precise A-site blockade.", "problem": "In a drug discovery program, a novel compound, designated EX-401, is being evaluated for its antibacterial properties. Laboratory experiments are conducted using an in vitro bacterial protein synthesis system. The system includes bacterial ribosomes, messenger RNA (mRNA) for a specific test protein, all necessary initiation and elongation factors, and a pool of aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, which are tRNA molecules charged with their corresponding amino acids.\n\nThe experiment reveals the following sequence of events in the presence of EX-401:\n1. The 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits correctly assemble on the mRNA strand.\n2. The initiator tRNA successfully binds to the start codon at the ribosomal P-site, forming the initiation complex.\n3. However, no subsequent elongation occurs. Further biochemical analysis demonstrates that EX-401 binds with high affinity to a component of the ribosome, physically obstructing the A-site. This blockage prevents any charged tRNA from docking and pairing with the next codon on the mRNA.\n\nBased on this specific mechanism of action, which of the following established antibiotic classes does EX-401 most closely mimic, and which ribosomal subunit is its primary target?\n\nA. Macrolide; targets the 50S subunit.\n\nB. Aminoglycoside; targets the 30S subunit.\n\nC. Tetracycline; targets the 30S subunit.\n\nD. Chloramphenicol; targets the 50S subunit.\n\nE. Quinolone; targets DNA gyrase.", "solution": "We start from the experimental observations:\n1. The 30S and 50S subunits assemble correctly on mRNA, and the initiator tRNA binds at the P-site to form a proper initiation complex. Therefore, drugs that prevent initiation complex formation are unlikely.\n2. No elongation occurs because a compound binds to the ribosome and physically obstructs the A-site, preventing any aminoacyl-tRNA from entering and pairing with the next codon.\n\nNow map these features to known antibiotic mechanisms:\n- Aminoglycosides bind the 30S subunit but characteristically cause misreading of mRNA and can interfere with initiation complex formation. Since the initiation complex forms correctly here, this is less consistent.\n- Tetracyclines bind the 30S subunit and specifically prevent the attachment of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site, thereby blocking elongation at the stage of A-site entry. This matches the described A-site obstruction with initiation intact.\n- Macrolides bind the 50S subunit and block translocation along the mRNA; they do not primarily prevent A-site entry of aminoacyl-tRNA.\n- Chloramphenicol binds the 50S subunit and inhibits peptidyl transferase activity, blocking peptide bond formation; A-site entry can still occur.\n- Quinolones inhibit DNA gyrase and do not target the ribosome.\n\nTherefore, the mechanism described—A-site blockade preventing aminoacyl-tRNA docking after a normal initiation complex forms—most closely matches tetracyclines targeting the 30S subunit.\n\nHence, the correct choice is tetracycline; targets the 30S subunit.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2077726"}, {"introduction": "Some of the most effective protein synthesis inhibitors don't just stop the ribosome; they actively corrupt its function, leading to the production of toxic, non-functional proteins. This practice explores such a mechanism, where a hypothetical compound causes the ribosome to misread the genetic code and prematurely terminate translation.

In a cell-free translation system containing all necessary components for protein synthesis (ribosomes, transfer RNAs, amino acids, and a specific messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) template), they add the new compound. The experiment yields a surprising result: instead of producing the expected full-length protein, the system produces a mixture of short, truncated polypeptide chains of various lengths. Further experiments confirm that the antibiotic binds irreversibly to the 30S ribosomal subunit. This binding induces a conformational change that significantly decreases the fidelity of translation, causing the ribosome to misread the mRNA codons, which in turn leads to the premature dissociation of the incomplete polypeptide.\n\nBased on these specific observational details, which of the following established classes of antibiotics does the novel compound's mechanism most closely resemble?\n\nA. Macrolides\n\nB. Tetracyclines\n\nC. Beta-lactams\n\nD. Aminoglycosides\n\nE. Fluoroquinolones", "solution": "First, extract the mechanistic clues from the observation: the compound binds irreversibly to the 30S ribosomal subunit, induces a conformational change that lowers translational fidelity, causes misreading of mRNA codons, and results in premature dissociation of incomplete, truncated polypeptides of varying lengths in a cell-free translation system.\n\nSecond, match these features to known antibiotic classes. Aminoglycosides characteristically bind the 30S subunit, often irreversibly, distort the decoding site, and decrease fidelity of translation, leading to misreading of mRNA codons and production of aberrant polypeptides, with potential premature termination; they are bactericidal. Tetracyclines also bind the 30S subunit but do so reversibly and primarily block the attachment of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site, thereby preventing elongation without inducing codon misreading; they are typically bacteriostatic and do not classically cause widespread mistranslation. Macrolides bind the 50S subunit and inhibit translocation, inconsistent with a 30S target. Beta-lactams inhibit cell wall synthesis enzymes (transpeptidases), acting outside the translational machinery. Fluoroquinolones inhibit DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, affecting DNA replication rather than translation.\n\nTherefore, the observed irreversible 30S binding with decreased fidelity, codon misreading, and truncated polypeptides most closely matches the mechanism of aminoglycosides.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2077748"}]}
