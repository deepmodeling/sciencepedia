By considering this hypothetical mutation, you will reinforce your understanding of the *trp* operon as a negatively controlled system, where expression is the default state unless actively switched off.", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the biosynthesis of the amino acid tryptophan is regulated by a repressible system known as the *trp* operon. This operon consists of a promoter, an operator, and five structural genes (*trpE*, *trpD*, *trpC*, *trpB*, *trpA*) that code for the enzymes required to synthesize tryptophan. The regulatory gene *trpR*, located at a different site on the bacterial chromosome, produces a repressor protein.\n\nUnder normal conditions in a wild-type cell, this repressor protein is synthesized in an inactive form. When intracellular levels of tryptophan are high, tryptophan molecules act as a co-repressor, binding to the repressor protein. This binding activates the repressor, enabling it to bind to the operator region of the *trp* operon, which in turn blocks RNA polymerase from transcribing the structural genes. Conversely, when tryptophan levels are low, the repressor remains inactive, cannot bind the operator, and the structural genes are transcribed.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of *E. coli* that has sustained a mutation in the *trpR* gene. This mutation renders the resulting repressor protein completely non-functional, meaning it is unable to bind to the operator sequence under any circumstances, regardless of the presence or absence of tryptophan.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the expression of the structural genes of the *trp* operon in this mutant strain when it is grown in two different environments: one medium completely lacking tryptophan and another medium rich in tryptophan?\n\nA. The structural genes of the *trp* operon will be transcribed in the medium lacking tryptophan, but not in the medium rich in tryptophan.\n\nB.

The structural genes of the *trp* operon will not be transcribed in the medium lacking tryptophan, but will be transcribed in the medium rich in tryptophan.", "solution": "We consider the repressible regulation of the *trp* operon. Let $R$ denote the repressor encoded by *trpR*, $W$ denote tryptophan (the co-repressor), and $O$ denote the operator. In the wild type, $R$ is synthesized in an inactive form; binding of $W$ produces the active complex $R \\cdot W$ that can bind $O$ and block RNA polymerase. Symbolically:\n- Low $[W]$: $R$ inactive, no $R \\cdot W$ formation, $R$ cannot bind $O$, transcription proceeds.\n- High $[W]$: $R \\cdot W$ forms, $R \\cdot W$ binds $O$, transcription is repressed.\n\nIn the mutant strain, the *trpR* gene carries a loss-of-function mutation such that the repressor protein is completely non-functional and cannot bind $O$ under any condition. This implies:\n- For any $[W]$, neither $R$ nor any hypothetical $R \\cdot W$ can bind $O$.\n- Therefore, $O$ remains unoccupied by repressor, so RNA polymerase is not blocked at the operator.\n\nConsequently, the structural genes are transcribed constitutively in both environments:\n- In medium lacking tryptophan: no repression possible, transcription occurs.\n- In medium rich in tryptophan: despite high $[W]$, the non-functional repressor cannot bind $O$, so transcription still occurs.\n\nThus, the correct choice is that the structural genes are transcribed in both conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2100875"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the primary on/off switch of the repressor, the *trp* operon employs a second, more nuanced regulatory layer called attenuation for fine-tuning. This practice problem [@problem_id:2100862] delves into this elegant mechanism by asking you to consider the consequences of preventing the translation of the leader peptide. Analyzing this scenario will clarify how transcription and translation are coupled to control gene expression through the formation of alternative RNA structures.", "problem": "In the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, the synthesis of the amino acid tryptophan is regulated by the *trp* operon, which exhibits two layers of negative control: repression and attenuation. Repression is mediated by the Trp repressor protein, the product of the *trpR* gene. In the presence of high levels of tryptophan (which acts as a co-repressor), the repressor binds to the operator site and blocks transcription.\n\nThe second layer, attenuation, occurs at a leader sequence (*trpL*) located between the operator and the first structural gene, *trpE*. The mRNA transcribed from the *trpL* region contains a short open reading frame (ORF) that codes for a 14-amino-acid leader peptide. This peptide notably contains two adjacent tryptophan codons. The *trpL* mRNA also possesses four distinct regions (Region 1, 2, 3, and 4) that can form alternative stem-loop secondary structures. The pairing of Region 2 with Region 3 forms an antiterminator hairpin, allowing transcription to proceed. In contrast, the pairing of Region 3 with Region 4 forms a rho-independent terminator hairpin, which, when followed by a poly-uracil tract, causes premature termination of transcription. The translation of the leader peptide is coupled to transcription and dictates which hairpin forms.\n\nConsider a mutant strain of *E. coli* that has a specific deletion of the AUG start codon for the leader peptide ORF within the *trpL* gene. This mutation completely prevents the initiation of translation of the leader peptide, but does not otherwise affect the sequence of Regions 1, 2, 3, or 4, nor does it affect the function of the promoter, operator, or the Trp repressor system.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the effect of this mutation on the expression of the *trp* operon's structural genes (e.g., *trpE*)?\n\nA. Expression of the *trp* structural genes will be constitutively high, regardless of tryptophan concentration.\n\nB. Expression of the *trp* structural genes will be constitutively low (attenuated), regardless of tryptophan concentration.\n\nC. Regulation of the *trp* structural genes will be unaffected, showing high expression in low tryptophan and low expression in high tryptophan, mirroring the wild-type phenotype.\n\nD. Regulation will be inverted: expression will be low in low tryptophan and high in high tryptophan.\n\nE. The operon will be exclusively controlled by the Trp repressor, with the attenuation mechanism being completely disabled in a way that always permits transcription through the leader sequence.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the two negative control layers governing the *trp* operon: repression by the Trp repressor and attenuation via the leader region *trpL*. Repression depends on the Trp repressor binding to the operator in the presence of tryptophan, preventing transcription initiation. Attenuation depends on transcription-translation coupling over the leader peptide ORF within *trpL* and the alternative RNA secondary structures formed by Regions 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nIn the wild type, the mechanistic sequence is as follows:\n- The leader peptide ORF contains two adjacent tryptophan codons within Region 1. Translation of this ORF by a ribosome occurs concurrently with transcription of the *trpL* mRNA.\n- When tryptophan is abundant, the ribosome does not stall, moves quickly through Region 1, and occludes Region 2, preventing the 2-3 antiterminator from forming. Consequently, Region 3 pairs with Region 4 to form the 3-4 terminator hairpin, leading to intrinsic (rho-independent) termination and attenuation.\n- When tryptophan is scarce, the ribosome stalls at the Trp codons in Region 1, covering Region 1 but not Region 2. This frees Region 2 to pair with Region 3, forming the 2-3 antiterminator hairpin, which prevents the 3-4 terminator from forming and allows RNA polymerase to continue into the structural genes.\n\nNow consider the mutation that deletes the AUG start codon of the leader ORF. By the stated conditions, this eliminates initiation of translation for the leader peptide but does not otherwise alter Regions 1, 2, 3, or 4, nor the promoter, operator, or the Trp repressor.\n\nWithout translation initiation, no ribosome binds or progresses along the leader sequence. Therefore:\n- There is no ribosome to stall at the Trp codons in Region 1 under low tryptophan, and no ribosome to occlude Region 2 under high tryptophan.\n- In the absence of ribosome occupancy, co-transcriptional RNA folding proceeds by default. As soon as Regions 1 and 2 are transcribed, they can pair to form the 1-2 hairpin. Formation of the 1-2 hairpin sequesters Region 2 and prevents the 2-3 antiterminator from forming.\n- When Region 4 is later transcribed, Region 3 is free to pair with Region 4, producing the 3-4 terminator hairpin followed by a poly-uracil tract, which causes rho-independent premature termination.\n\nThis default folding and termination occur regardless of tryptophan levels, because tryptophan controls attenuation only via its effect on ribosome movement, and here translation is entirely prevented. Thus, attenuation becomes constitutively active, causing premature termination upstream of the structural genes in both low and high tryptophan.\n\nThe Trp repressor system remains intact, but even when the repressor is not bound (low tryptophan), transcription will still be terminated prematurely by the constitutive formation of the 3-4 terminator. When the repressor is bound (high tryptophan), transcription initiation is blocked, further ensuring low expression. In either case, expression of the structural genes (such as *trpE*) remains low.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that the operon exhibits constitutively low expression due to persistent attenuation, independent of tryptophan concentration, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2100862"}, {"introduction": "We now move to a classic genetic scenario that synthesizes the core principles of operon regulation: the partial diploid, or merodiploid. This problem [@problem_id:2100823] presents a cell with two different versions of the *trp* operon and challenges you to predict the total output of tryptophan-synthesizing enzymes. Successfully solving this requires a clear distinction between *cis*-acting elements, which affect only adjacent genes, and *trans*-acting factors, which can diffuse through the cell to act on any target.", "problem": "An *Escherichia coli* cell's synthesis of the amino acid tryptophan is regulated by the *trp* operon, a classic example of a repressible system. The operon consists of a promoter (*P*), an operator (*O*), and a set of structural genes ($Z$) that code for the necessary enzymes. Transcription is controlled by a repressor protein, encoded by the *trpR* gene, which is located elsewhere on the chromosome. In the absence of tryptophan, the repressor is inactive, and the operon is transcribed. When tryptophan is present, it acts as a corepressor, binding to the repressor and activating it. The active repressor-tryptophan complex then binds to the operator, blocking transcription.\n\nConsider a wild-type strain where all components are functional ($trpR^+ O^+ Z^+$). In a medium completely lacking tryptophan, the enzymes are synthesized at a maximum rate, which we define as $R_{max}$. When this wild-type strain is grown in a medium with a high concentration of tryptophan, the operon is strongly repressed, and the enzyme synthesis rate drops to a basal level of $R_{basal} = 0.01 R_{max}$.\n\nNow, consider a special strain of *E. coli* that is a partial diploid (merodiploid). Its genotype is as follows:\n- **Chromosome:** $trpR^+ P^+ O^c Z^+$\n- **Plasmid (F' factor):** $P^+ O^+ Z^+$\n\nThe $O^c$ mutation is an operator-constitutive mutation; it alters the operator sequence such that the active repressor-tryptophan complex cannot bind to it. An operon with an $O^c$ mutation is thus expressed constitutively at the maximum rate $R_{max}$, regardless of the tryptophan concentration. The *trpR* gene on the chromosome is wild-type and produces a functional repressor protein that can diffuse throughout the cell. Both sets of structural genes, $Z^+$, on the chromosome and the plasmid are wild-type.\n\nIf this partial diploid strain is grown in a medium containing a high concentration of tryptophan, what is the total rate of synthesis of the tryptophan-synthesizing enzymes, expressed as a multiple of $R_{max}$? Provide your answer as a numerical value rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total rate of synthesis of enzymes from the *trp* operon in a specific partial diploid *E. coli* strain grown in a high-tryptophan medium. We need to analyze the expression from both the chromosomal and plasmid-borne operons and sum their contributions.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the state of the regulatory components in the cell. The cell is grown in a medium with high tryptophan concentration. The chromosome carries a wild-type repressor gene, $trpR^+$. This gene is transcribed and translated to produce the TrpR repressor protein. Since tryptophan is abundant in the cell, it will act as a corepressor, binding to the inactive TrpR protein and converting it into its active conformation. Therefore, the cytoplasm is filled with active repressor-tryptophan complexes. This repressor protein is a *trans*-acting factor, meaning it can diffuse throughout the cell and interact with any accessible operator sequence.\n\nNext, we evaluate the expression from the chromosomal operon. The genotype of the chromosome is $trpR^+ P^+ O^c Z^+$. The critical element is the operator-constitutive mutation, $O^c$. By definition, the active repressor-tryptophan complex cannot bind to this mutated operator. As a result, transcription from the chromosomal operon is not blocked, even in the presence of the active repressor. The expression is constitutive. The problem states that an operon with an $O^c$ mutation is expressed at the maximum rate, $R_{max}$.\nSo, the rate of enzyme synthesis from the chromosome is:\n$$R_{\\text{chromosome}} = R_{max}$$\nThe $O^c$ mutation is *cis*-dominant, meaning it affects only the expression of the structural genes ($Z^+$) located on the same DNA molecule (the chromosome).\n\nNow, we evaluate the expression from the plasmid-borne operon. The genotype of the plasmid is $P^+ O^+ Z^+$. This operon has a wild-type operator, $O^+$. The active repressor-tryptophan complexes, produced from the chromosomal $trpR^+$ gene, are present in the cytoplasm and can bind to this wild-type operator on the plasmid. This binding blocks RNA polymerase from transcribing the structural genes on the plasmid. This is an example where the *trans*-acting repressor, made from the chromosomal gene, regulates the plasmid-borne operon. The expression from this operon is therefore repressed. According to the problem, the repressed rate of synthesis for a wild-type operon is the basal level, $R_{basal}$.\nSo, the rate of enzyme synthesis from the plasmid is:\n$$R_{\\text{plasmid}} = R_{basal} = 0.01 R_{max}$$\n\nThe total rate of synthesis of the tryptophan enzymes in the partial diploid cell is the sum of the rates from the chromosome and the plasmid.\n$$R_{\\text{total}} = R_{\\text{chromosome}} + R_{\\text{plasmid}}$$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$$R_{\\text{total}} = R_{max} + 0.01 R_{max}$$\n$$R_{\\text{total}} = (1 + 0.01) R_{max}$$\n$$R_{\\text{total}} = 1.01 R_{max}$$\n\nThe question asks for the total rate expressed as a multiple of $R_{max}$. The calculated multiple is 1.01. This value is already given to three significant figures as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.01}$$", "id": "2100823"}]}
