This problem challenges you to think like a microbial geneticist, using experimental evidence to diagnose a malfunction in the system. By working backward from the observed phenotype, you will solidify your understanding of the distinct and essential roles of lactose permease (product of the *lacY* gene) and $\\beta$-galactosidase (product of the *lacZ* gene) in lactose metabolism [@problem_id:2099265].", "problem": "A microbiologist isolates a mutant strain of *Escherichia coli* that exhibits an unusual phenotype related to lactose metabolism. When this mutant strain is grown on a minimal medium containing lactose as the sole carbon source, no growth is observed. However, a subsequent experiment is performed where the bacterial cells are first treated with a chemical agent that renders the cell membrane permeable to small molecules like lactose. When lactose and the appropriate reagents for a colorimetric assay are added to these permeabilized cells, the activity of the enzyme β-galactosidase is readily detected, indicating that the cells are capable of metabolizing lactose once it is inside the cytoplasm.\n\nBased on these experimental observations, which of the following components of the lac operon is most likely defective in this mutant strain?\n\nA. The *lacZ* gene, which codes for the enzyme β-galactosidase.\n\nB. The *lacY* gene, which codes for the protein lactose permease.\n\nC. The *lacI* gene, which codes for the lac repressor protein.\n\nD. The *lacP* site, which is the promoter region for the operon.\n\nE. The *lacO* site, which is the operator region where the repressor binds.", "solution": "We analyze lactose utilization in the lac operon by enumerating the necessary steps and the role of each component:\n1) For growth on lactose as sole carbon source, cells must import lactose across the membrane and then cleave it to glucose and galactose. Import is mediated by lactose permease (product of the lacY gene), and cleavage is mediated by beta-galactosidase (product of the lacZ gene). Transcription of lacZ and lacY from the promoter lacP is regulated by the lac repressor (product of lacI) binding to the operator lacO in the absence of inducer.\n2) Observation: The mutant shows no growth on minimal medium with lactose. This implies an inability to use lactose as a carbon source. Potential causes include: loss of lactose import (defect in lacY), loss of lactose hydrolysis (defect in lacZ), or a transcriptional defect preventing expression of these enzymes (defect in lacP, lacO with repressor binding, or a superrepressor lacI^{s}).\n3) Critical observation: After permeabilizing the membrane to allow small molecules like lactose to enter the cytoplasm, the addition of lactose and colorimetric reagents reveals readily detectable beta-galactosidase activity. This demonstrates that:\n   - The beta-galactosidase enzyme is present and functional, so a defect in lacZ (option A) is inconsistent.\n   - The operon must be expressed at least to the extent that beta-galactosidase protein is produced, making a nonfunctional promoter lacP (option D) or an operator defect that locks the operon off (option E in that sense) inconsistent with the observed enzyme activity. A lacI defect (option C) typically causes constitutive expression rather than a failure to grow on lactose; moreover, the key barrier removed by permeabilization is transport, not repression.\n4) The rescue of detectable beta-galactosidase activity specifically upon membrane permeabilization indicates that the block lies at lactose entry into the cell. This is the function of lactose permease encoded by lacY.\n5) Therefore, the most likely defective component in this mutant is the lacY gene encoding lactose permease.\n\nHence, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2099265"}, {"introduction": "We now shift from the function of individual parts to the logic of their regulation. This practice utilizes a partial diploid, a classic genetic tool for dissecting how different alleles like $I^+$ and $I^-$ interact within a single cell. Analyzing this engineered genotype allows you to explore the crucial difference between a *trans*-acting factor, like the diffusible repressor protein, and a *cis*-acting element, like the operator sequence, revealing how inducibility can be restored [@problem_id:2099264].", "problem": "In a microbiology laboratory, a student is studying gene regulation in *Escherichia coli*. The focus of the experiment is the lactose (lac) operon, a classic example of an inducible system for gene expression. The key components of this operon are:\n- The regulator gene, *lacI*, which codes for a repressor protein. The wild-type allele $I^+$ produces a functional repressor, while the mutant allele $I^-$ produces a non-functional one.\n- The operator, *lacO*, a DNA sequence that acts as a binding site for the repressor protein. The wild-type allele is $O^+$.\n- The structural gene *lacZ*, which codes for the enzyme β-galactosidase. The wild-type allele $Z^+$ produces a functional enzyme that can break down lactose, while the mutant allele $Z^-$ produces a non-functional version.\n\nThe student creates a partial diploid (merodiploid) strain of *E. coli* using an F' plasmid. This strain has one copy of the lac operon genes on its chromosome and another copy on the F' plasmid. The genotype of this specific strain is represented as `I+ O+ Z- / F' I- O+ Z+`, where the genes to the left of the slash are on the chromosome and the genes to the right are on the F' plasmid.\n\nRecall that the repressor protein (*lacI* product) is a trans-acting factor, meaning it can diffuse within the cell and act on any applicable DNA sequence. In contrast, the operator (*lacO*) is a cis-acting element, affecting only the genes located on the same DNA molecule.\n\nBased on this genetic makeup, predict the phenotype of this partial diploid cell. Will the cell be capable of inducible synthesis of functional β-galactosidase?\n\nA. Yes, the synthesis of functional β-galactosidase is inducible.\n\nB. No, the synthesis of functional β-galactosidase is constitutive (it occurs regardless of the presence of an inducer).\n\nC. No, the synthesis of functional β-galactosidase is permanently repressed (it never occurs, even with an inducer).\n\nD. The phenotype is a mix of constitutive and repressed states, so it is not strictly inducible.", "solution": "Let the chromosomal genotype be $I^{+}\\,O^{+}\\,Z^{-}$ and the F-prime plasmid genotype be $I^{-}\\,O^{+}\\,Z^{+}$. The $I$ gene product (lac repressor) is a trans-acting protein; therefore any functional repressor made from $I^{+}$ can diffuse and act on operators on both the chromosome and the plasmid. The $O$ site is a cis-acting DNA element; thus each $O^{+}$ can be bound by functional repressor and can be relieved by inducer only for genes on the same DNA molecule. The $Z$ gene encodes beta-galactosidase; only $Z^{+}$ yields functional enzyme, whereas $Z^{-}$ does not.\n\nBecause $I^{+}$ produces a functional repressor and $I^{-}$ produces a nonfunctional one, the presence of $I^{+}$ ensures that functional repressor is present in the cell (trans-dominant). Both operators are $O^{+}$, so in the absence of inducer, the functional repressor binds each $O^{+}$ and blocks transcription from both operons. Consequently, with no inducer, neither the chromosomal $Z^{-}$ operon nor the plasmid $Z^{+}$ operon will be transcribed, and no beta-galactosidase activity will be detected.\n\nIn the presence of inducer, the inducer binds the functional repressor and prevents its binding to $O^{+}$, thereby allowing transcription from both operons. Transcription of the chromosomal $Z^{-}$ operon yields no functional enzyme, but transcription of the plasmid $Z^{+}$ operon produces functional beta-galactosidase. Thus, functional enzyme is synthesized only when inducer is present.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is inducible synthesis of functional beta-galactosidase, corresponding to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2099264"}, {"introduction": "Mastery of the *lac* operon means understanding that its expression is not a simple binary switch, but a finely tuned system responsive to multiple signals. This exercise requires you to synthesize the concepts of both negative and positive control to rank transcription levels across various scenarios. By comparing the effects of glucose and lactose availability, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how *E. coli* integrates environmental cues to achieve a precise level of gene expression [@problem_id:2099292].", "problem": "An *E. coli* cell's ability to metabolize lactose is governed by the *lac* operon. The expression of structural genes within this operon, such as *lacZ*, is meticulously regulated by two primary mechanisms:\n\n1.  **Negative Control:** The lac repressor protein, encoded by the *lacI* gene, acts as a negative regulator. In the absence of lactose, the repressor binds to a specific DNA sequence called the operator (*lacO*), physically obstructing RNA polymerase and preventing transcription. When lactose is present, its metabolite, allolactose, binds to the repressor, causing a conformational change that prevents it from binding to the operator.\n2.  **Positive Control:** The Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP) acts as a positive regulator. Its activity is modulated by the intracellular concentration of Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP), which is inversely proportional to the availability of glucose. When glucose levels are low, cAMP levels are high. The CAP-cAMP complex then binds to a specific site near the promoter, enhancing the recruitment of RNA polymerase and significantly boosting the rate of transcription.\n\nConsider the following four distinct scenarios for *E. coli* cultures. Let $T_1$, $T_2$, $T_3$, and $T_4$ represent the steady-state transcription rate of the *lacZ* gene in each respective scenario.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** A wild-type strain is grown in a medium containing a high concentration of glucose and no lactose.\n*   **Scenario 2:** A wild-type strain is grown in a medium containing no glucose and no lactose.\n*   **Scenario 3:** A mutant strain possessing a constitutive operator ($O^c$), to which the lac repressor cannot bind, is grown in a medium containing a high concentration of glucose and no lactose.\n*   **Scenario 4:** A wild-type strain is grown in a medium containing a high concentration of lactose and no glucose.\n\nBased on your understanding of the *lac* operon's dual-control system, which of the following options correctly ranks the transcription rates from highest to lowest?\n\nA. $T_4 > T_3 > T_2 > T_1$\n\nB. $T_4 > T_2 > T_3 > T_1$\n\nC. $T_3 > T_4 > T_2 > T_1$\n\nD. $T_4 > T_3 > T_1 > T_2$\n\nE. $T_3 > T_1 > T_2 > T_4$", "solution": "We use the dual-control logic of the lac operon: negative control by the lac repressor at the operator and positive control by the CAP–cAMP complex at the CAP site. In the absence of lactose, the repressor binds the operator and blocks transcription; in the presence of lactose (via allolactose), the repressor does not bind, allowing transcription. Low glucose yields high cAMP, so CAP–cAMP binds and enhances RNA polymerase recruitment, increasing transcription; high glucose yields low cAMP, so CAP is inactive and there is no positive enhancement.\n\nEvaluate each scenario:\n\nScenario 1 (high glucose, no lactose, wild type): No lactose implies the repressor binds the operator, blocking transcription. High glucose implies low cAMP, so CAP is inactive. Both negative repression and lack of positive activation apply. Thus transcription is effectively minimal. Symbolically, this yields $T_{1}$ at the lowest level.\n\nScenario 2 (no glucose, no lactose, wild type): No lactose still means the repressor is bound, blocking transcription. However, no glucose implies high cAMP, so CAP–cAMP is active. Positive activation cannot overcome an operator-bound repressor, but it can modestly enhance the rare transcription events when the repressor transiently dissociates. Hence $T_{2}$ remains low but is greater than $T_{1}$, so $T_{2} > T_{1}$.\n\nScenario 3 (high glucose, no lactose, $O^{c}$ mutant): The constitutive operator prevents repressor binding, so there is no negative control. High glucose implies low cAMP, so CAP is inactive. Transcription proceeds at basal levels without positive activation. This basal level exceeds the repressed levels of Scenarios 1 and 2. Thus $T_{3} > T_{2} > T_{1}$.\n\nScenario 4 (no glucose, high lactose, wild type): High lactose prevents repressor binding (derepression). No glucose implies high cAMP, so CAP–cAMP is active. Both derepression and positive activation apply, giving maximal transcription. Thus $T_{4}$ is the highest: $T_{4} > T_{3}$.\n\nCombining these, the overall ordering is\n$$T_{4} > T_{3} > T_{2} > T_{1}.$$\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2099292"}]}
