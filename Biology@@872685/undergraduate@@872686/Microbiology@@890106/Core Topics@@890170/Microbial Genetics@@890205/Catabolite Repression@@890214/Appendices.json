{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The *lac* operon is a classic model for gene regulation because it elegantly integrates two distinct layers of control: negative regulation by the LacI repressor and positive regulation by the Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP). To truly understand how *E. coli* prioritizes its food sources, it is essential to disentangle these two systems. This practice challenges you to do just that by comparing mutants that lack either the repressor or the activator, forcing you to predict gene expression under various conditions and clarifying the specific role each protein plays in the cell's decision-making process [@problem_id:1473438].", "problem": "The *lac* operon in *Escherichia coli* is a canonical system for studying gene regulation. It comprises a set of genes required for lactose metabolism, including `lacZ`, which encodes the enzyme β-galactosidase. The expression of this operon is tightly controlled by the availability of sugars in the environment.\n\nTwo key regulatory genes are involved:\n1.  The `lacI` gene, which is located outside the operon, codes for the LacI repressor protein. In the absence of lactose, the LacI protein binds to a region of the operon called the operator, physically blocking transcription. When lactose is present, it is converted to allolactose, which binds to the LacI protein and prevents it from binding to the operator.\n2.  The `crp` gene codes for the Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP). This protein acts as an activator. When glucose levels in the cell are low, CAP binds to cyclic AMP (cAMP) and then to a site near the operon's promoter, significantly enhancing the rate of transcription. When glucose levels are high, CAP remains inactive and does not bind to the DNA.\n\nConsider two different mutant strains of *E. coli*:\n-   **Strain 1:** A `crp-` mutant, which has a loss-of-function mutation in the `crp` gene and cannot produce a functional CAP protein.\n-   **Strain 2:** A `lacI-` mutant, which has a loss-of-function mutation in the `lacI` gene and cannot produce a functional LacI repressor protein.\n\nFor each mutant, predict the level of β-galactosidase expression when grown in four different media.

This exercise bridges that gap by asking you to forecast the growth curve of an *E. coli* strain that cannot synthesize the critical signaling molecule, cyclic AMP (cAMP). By working through this hypothetical scenario, you will see firsthand how a single molecular defect—the inability to activate the *lac* operon—translates into a macroscopic phenotype, fundamentally altering the classic diauxic growth pattern [@problem_id:2057632].", "problem": "An experimental strain of *Escherichia coli* possesses a loss-of-function mutation in the *cyaA* gene, rendering its protein product, adenylate cyclase, completely non-functional.

Therefore, the cell cannot synthesize cAMP under any condition, so intracellular cAMP is effectively absent.\n\nRegulation of the lac operon requires two layers:\n- Negative control by LacI repressor: lactose (via allolactose) relieves repression by binding LacI and reducing its affinity for the operator.\n- Positive control by the CRP–cAMP complex (also known as CAP–cAMP): CRP requires cAMP to form the active complex that binds the promoter and recruits RNA polymerase for high-level transcription.\n\nIn this mutant, even if lactose is abundant and can in principle induce by inactivating LacI, the absence of cAMP prevents formation of the CRP–cAMP complex. Without this activator, transcription from the lac promoter remains at very low, non-physiological levels, insufficient to produce functional amounts of LacY (permease) and LacZ (beta-galactosidase), thus preventing effective lactose uptake and metabolism.\n\nGlucose utilization does not require cAMP-dependent activation of catabolic operons; hence the mutant can grow on the available glucose. Given the medium has low glucose and high lactose:\n- Initially, the culture will grow using the available glucose.\n- Upon depletion of glucose, the inability to activate the lac operon (due to absent cAMP) prevents switching to lactose metabolism.\n- Therefore, no second growth phase on lactose occurs; instead, growth ceases and the culture enters stationary phase.\n\nThis rules out classic diauxic growth (requires cAMP to activate lac after glucose is exhausted), growth on lactose first, or simultaneous co-utilization. It also rules out no growth at all, since glucose can be metabolized.\n\nThus, the most accurate prediction is a single growth phase on glucose followed by stationary phase without lactose utilization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2057632"}, {"introduction": "Catabolite repression is often taught as being solely governed by cAMP levels, but the reality is more sophisticated. *E. coli* employs a second, potent mechanism called inducer exclusion, where the transport of glucose actively blocks the uptake of other sugars like lactose. This practice delves into this nuanced layer of regulation by presenting a mutant where inducer exclusion is disabled but the CAP-cAMP system remains intact. This thought experiment will challenge you to predict the effect on diauxic growth and provide deeper insight into what governs the \"lag phase\" between utilizing two different sugars [@problem_id:1473460].", "problem": "In the study of bacterial gene regulation, the diauxic growth curve is a classic example of metabolic preference. Consider a laboratory experiment where a wild-type strain of *Escherichia coli* is cultured in a minimal medium containing equal molar concentrations of both glucose and lactose. This strain exhibits a typical diauxic growth pattern.\n\nNow, consider a mutant strain of *E. coli*. This particular mutant has a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the Enzyme IIA component of the phosphotransferase system (PTS).

The mutant will exhibit a reversed diauxic growth pattern, prioritizing the metabolism of lactose first before switching to glucose.", "solution": "To determine the growth pattern of the mutant strain, we must analyze the two primary layers of regulation of the *lac* operon in the presence of glucose: positive control by the Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP)-cAMP complex and repression via inducer exclusion.\n\nFirst, let's review the regulation in a wild-type *E. coli* cell in a medium containing both glucose and lactose, which leads to the classic diauxic growth curve.\n1.  **Phase 1: Glucose Metabolism.** Glucose is the preferred carbon source. Its transport into the cell via the phosphotransferase system (PTS) has two major regulatory consequences. First, it inhibits the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, leading to low intracellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP). Without cAMP, CAP cannot bind to the *lac* promoter, and transcription of the *lac* operon is not activated. This is the positive control aspect. Second, the unphosphorylated form of the PTS protein EIIA accumulates and directly inhibits the activity of lactose permease (LacY). This is inducer exclusion. It prevents lactose from entering the cell, so no allolactose can be synthesized to inactivate the LacI repressor. The *lac* operon is therefore doubly repressed: the activator (CAP) is absent and the repressor (LacI) is bound. The cell grows exclusively on glucose.\n2.  **Lag Phase.** Once glucose is exhausted, the inhibitory effects are lifted. Adenylyl cyclase becomes active, cAMP levels rise, and CAP-cAMP complexes form. Inducer exclusion ceases, allowing lactose to enter the cell via the few permease molecules that are present due to basal expression. Lactose is converted to allolactose, which then binds to and inactivates the LacI repressor. The lag phase represents the time required for these molecular rearrangements to occur and for the cell to synthesize sufficient quantities of lactose permease and β-galactosidase to begin metabolizing lactose efficiently.\n3.  **Phase 2: Lactose Metabolism.** With the LacI repressor removed and the CAP-cAMP complex bound, the *lac* operon is fully induced. The cell synthesizes the necessary enzymes and grows by metabolizing lactose.\n\nNow, let's consider the specified mutant. The mutation disables inducer exclusion, but the CAP-cAMP system remains functional.\n1.  **Phase 1: Glucose Present.** Glucose is present, so it is transported into the cell. As in the wild-type, this leads to low intracellular cAMP levels, and the CAP protein remains inactive. However, the crucial difference is that inducer exclusion is disabled. Therefore, lactose permease (LacY) is active, and lactose is transported into the cell from the very beginning. Inside the cell, lactose is converted to allolactose, which inactivates the LacI repressor, causing it to detach from the operator region of the *lac* operon. In this state, the operon is no longer repressed by LacI, but it is also not activated by CAP. This results in a low level of transcription—higher than the basal level of a fully repressed operon, but much lower than the fully activated level. The cell will produce a small number of *lac* enzymes while primarily growing on glucose.\n2.  **Transition (Lag Phase).** As soon as the glucose is depleted, the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase is lifted. Intracellular cAMP levels rise rapidly. CAP-cAMP complexes form and can immediately bind to the *lac* promoter to strongly activate transcription. Since the LacI repressor is already inactivated by allolactose (which has been present all along) and a small pool of lactose-metabolizing enzymes already exists, the switch to full lactose metabolism can occur almost instantaneously. The time needed to induce the operon is drastically reduced compared to the wild-type, which had to start from a state of double repression. Consequently, the lag phase is significantly shortened or may be practically absent.\n3.  **Phase 2: Lactose Present.** The *lac* operon is now fully activated, and the cell grows on lactose, just as in the wild-type.\n\nBased on this analysis, the mutant will still show two distinct growth phases because the CAP-cAMP system ensures glucose is used first. However, the transition between these phases will be much faster.\n\nEvaluating the options:\nA. Incorrect. The CAP-cAMP system still enforces preferential use of glucose, so simultaneous metabolism at maximal rates does not happen.\nB. Incorrect. The mutation eliminates one of the two key repressive mechanisms active during glucose metabolism, which must have an effect on the transition.\nC. Correct. The mutant first consumes glucose. The lag phase is significantly shorter because the *lac* operon is already derepressed (LacI is inactive) and only awaits CAP activation, which occurs as soon as glucose is depleted.\nD. Incorrect. The *lac* operon machinery is entirely functional; the cell is perfectly capable of using lactose once glucose is gone.\nE. Incorrect. The CAP-cAMP system ensures glucose preference, a fundamental aspect of catabolite repression that is intact in the mutant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1473460"}]}
