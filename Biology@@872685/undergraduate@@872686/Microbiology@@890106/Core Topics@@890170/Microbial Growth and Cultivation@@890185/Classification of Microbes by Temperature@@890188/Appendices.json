This first exercise explores the core reason for this dependence by examining the case of a mesophile, Escherichia coli, grown below its optimal temperature. By analyzing the scenario [@problem_id:2059490], you will connect the macroscopic observation of reduced growth to the molecular-level impact of temperature on enzyme kinetics.", "problem": "A microbiology student is culturing the bacterium *Escherichia coli*, which is known to have an optimal growth temperature of $37^{\\circ}\\text{C}$. For an experiment, two identical flasks of nutrient broth are inoculated with the same initial concentration of *E. coli*. The first flask is correctly placed in an incubator set to $37^{\\circ}\\text{C}$. By mistake, the second flask is left on the lab bench at a constant room temperature of $22^{\\circ}\\text{C}$. After 24 hours, the student observes that the flask in the $37^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ incubator is highly turbid, indicating robust bacterial growth, while the flask at $22^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ is only slightly turbid, indicating significantly inhibited growth.\n\nWhich one of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for the observed difference in growth between the two cultures?\n\nA. At the cooler temperature of $22^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, the bacterial cell membranes lose their structural integrity and become excessively fluid, causing leakage of essential ions and subsequent cell death.\nB. *E. coli* is classified as a mesophile. The temperature of $22^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ is below its optimal range, which significantly reduces the kinetic rate of its essential metabolic enzymes, thereby slowing the overall rate of cell division.\nC. The cooler temperature of $22^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ causes the permanent, irreversible denaturation of key respiratory enzymes, completely halting energy production and growth.\nD. At $22^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, the solubility of oxygen in the nutrient broth decreases dramatically, creating an anoxic environment that prevents the aerobic growth of *E. coli*.\nE. In response to the suboptimal temperature, *E. coli* is induced to form metabolically dormant endospores, a survival state that does not contribute to the turbidity of the culture.", "solution": "We compare growth at temperatures below and at the optimal temperature for a mesophilic bacterium, Escherichia coli. The core determinant of growth rate is the aggregate rate of enzyme-catalyzed biochemical reactions sustaining metabolism and biomass production. For a given enzymatic step with activation energy $E_{a}$, the temperature dependence of the rate constant $k$ is given by the Arrhenius relation:\n$$\nk(T) = A \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{R T}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the pre-exponential factor and $R$ is the gas constant. For $T_{1}<T_{2}$ with the same $E_{a}>0$, it follows that\n$$\n\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{R T_{1}}\\right) < \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{R T_{2}}\\right) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k(T_{1})<k(T_{2}).\n$$\nTherefore, lowering temperature from near the optimal value to a substantially lower value reduces the rates of essential metabolic reactions, which decreases the specific growth rate $\\mu(T)$ and increases the generation time. After a fixed interval (here, 24 hours), the culture at the lower temperature will have undergone fewer doublings and thus exhibit less turbidity, consistent with the observation.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n\n- Option A is incorrect because at lower temperature, phospholipid bilayers become less fluid (more ordered), not excessively fluid. Loss of membrane integrity by excessive fluidity is associated with elevated, not reduced, temperatures.\n\n- Option B is correct. E. coli is a mesophile with an optimal growth temperature around human body temperature; at a lower temperature, the kinetic rates of its enzymes are reduced according to the Arrhenius dependence above, slowing the overall rate of cell division and explaining the markedly reduced turbidity at room temperature.\n\n- Option C is incorrect because low temperature does not cause permanent, irreversible denaturation. Irreversible denaturation is typically caused by high temperatures; cold tends to slow dynamics and may cause reversible inactivation that is relieved upon warming.\n\n- Option D is incorrect because the solubility of gases in water increases as temperature decreases (by Le Châtelier’s principle for exothermic dissolution), so oxygen is not limiting at the lower temperature. Moreover, E. coli is a facultative anaerobe and can grow without oxygen.\n\n- Option E is incorrect because E. coli does not form endospores; endospore formation is characteristic of certain Gram-positive genera such as Bacillus and Clostridium.\n\nThus, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is that suboptimal temperature reduces enzyme-catalyzed reaction rates and thereby slows growth, which is precisely stated in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2059490"}, {"introduction": "While general temperature categories are useful, precise classification requires a careful look at an organism's complete growth profile across its minimum, optimum, and maximum temperatures. This is especially true for cold-tolerant microbes, where the distinction between a true psychrophile and a psychrotroph has significant practical implications. This problem [@problem_id:2059506] challenges you to apply these definitions to a real-world scenario of food spoilage, honing your ability to make accurate classifications based on cardinal temperature data.", "problem": "A microbiology student is tasked with characterizing an unknown bacterium isolated from a carton of milk that showed signs of spoilage despite being properly stored in a refrigerator at $4^{\\circ}\\text{C}$.

While it grows at $4^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, the rate is significantly slower than at its optimum temperature. The bacterium shows no growth at temperatures above $40^{\\circ}\\text{C}$. Based on this complete temperature profile, what is the most specific and accurate classification for this organism?\n\nA. Psychrophile\nB. Mesophile\nC. Thermophile\nD. Psychrotroph\nE. Hyperthermophile", "solution": "We identify the temperature-growth classification by matching the observed growth profile to standard definitions. The organism grows at refrigeration temperature $4^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ (albeit slowly), has its maximum growth rate at $25^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, and shows no growth above $40^{\\circ}\\text{C}$. \n\nBy definition, psychrophiles have optimal growth at approximately $15^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ or lower and typically do not have an optimum in the $20$ to $30^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ range; moreover, many psychrophiles fail to grow at temperatures near or above $20^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, so the observed optimum at $25^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ contradicts a psychrophile classification. Mesophiles have optima in the range $20$ to $45^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, but most mesophiles do not grow at $4^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ and are not typically implicated in refrigerated food spoilage; thus, the ability to grow at $4^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ and cause spoilage argues against a simple mesophile classification. Thermophiles and hyperthermophiles require higher optimum temperatures, typically $>45^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ and $>80^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ respectively, which are incompatible with the observed lack of growth above $40^{\\circ}\\text{C}$. \n\nPsychrotrophs (psychrotolerant organisms) are defined by their ability to grow at refrigeration temperatures (near $0$ to $7^{\\circ}\\text{C}$), while having an optimum in the mesophilic range, commonly around $20$ to $30^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, and often an upper limit near $35$ to $40^{\\circ}\\text{C}$.

The observed profile—growth at $4^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, maximal growth at $25^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, and no growth above $40^{\\circ}\\text{C}$—matches the psychrotroph definition most specifically and accurately.

This bacterium has an optimal growth temperature of $37.0^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ and, under ideal conditions at this temperature, a generation time of exactly $60$ minutes. The team designs an experiment to determine whether refrigeration at $4.0^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ has a bacteriostatic (inhibits growth but cells remain viable) or bactericidal (kills cells) effect.\n\nThe experiment proceeds as follows:\n1.  A starting liquid culture is prepared and its viable cell concentration is measured by plating, yielding an initial concentration, $C_0 = 2.0 \\times 10^6$ Colony Forming Units per milliliter (CFU/mL).\n2.  The culture is immediately placed in a refrigerator and stored at $4.0^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ for exactly $48$ hours.\n3.  After the 48-hour incubation period, two procedures are performed simultaneously:\n    a.  **Test 1:** A sample from the refrigerated culture is taken, serially diluted, and plated to determine the viable cell concentration, which is found to be $C_{48} = 1.8 \\times 10^6$ CFU/mL.\n    b.  **Test 2:** Another sample from the refrigerated culture is transferred to a fresh, pre-warmed growth medium and incubated at the optimal temperature of $37.0^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ for exactly $60$ minutes (one generation time). Afterwards, its viable cell concentration is measured and found to be $C_{rec} = 3.6 \\times 10^6$ CFU/mL.\n\nBased on the results from Test 1 ($C_{48}$) and Test 2 ($C_{rec}$) relative to the initial concentration ($C_0$), what is the most accurate conclusion about the effect of $4.0^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ on this bacterium?\n\nA. The cold temperature is strongly bactericidal, killing the majority of the bacterial population.\nB. The cold temperature is purely bacteriostatic, causing no cell death, and the effect is fully reversible.\nC.

The generation-time rule for binary fission under optimal conditions is that after one generation, viable cells double, so for a viable population $C(t+g) = 2\\,C(t)$, where $g$ is one generation time.\n\nFirst, assess growth or death at $4.0^{\\circ}\\text{C}$. Compute the relative change during refrigeration:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{48}}{C_{0}} = \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^{6}}{2.0 \\times 10^{6}} = 0.9,\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\frac{C_{48}-C_{0}}{C_{0}} = 0.9 - 1 = -0.1.\n$$\nThis indicates a net decrease in viable count (a loss of $0.1$ of the initial population), showing that there was no growth at $4.0^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ and that some cells died. Therefore, options asserting growth at $4.0^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ or purely bacteriostatic action with zero death are inconsistent with the data.\n\nSecond, test reversibility of the cold effect in survivors by comparing the expected post-recovery count (if survivors are fully capable of normal division) with the observed $C_{\\text{rec}}$. The expectation after one generation at $37.0^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ is\n$$\nC_{\\text{pred}} = 2\\,C_{48} = 2 \\times 1.8 \\times 10^{6} = 3.6 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{CFU/mL},\n$$\nwhich matches the observed $C_{\\text{rec}}$. Equivalently,\n$$\n\\frac{C_{\\text{rec}}}{C_{48}} = \\frac{3.6 \\times 10^{6}}{1.8 \\times 10^{6}} = 2,\n$$\nconfirming exact doubling of the surviving population in one generation. Thus, the cold-induced inhibition is reversible for the survivors; there is no evidence of irreversible metabolic damage preventing regrowth.\n\nFinally, compare these findings with the options:\n- Strongly bactericidal would require $C_{48} \\ll C_{0}$, which is contradicted by $\\frac{C_{48}}{C_{0}} = 0.9$.\n- Purely bacteriostatic with no death would require $C_{48} = C_{0}$, contradicted by the $0.1$ loss.\n- Psychrotrophic growth at $4.0^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ would require $C_{48} > C_{0}$, contradicted by $C_{48} < C_{0}$.\n- Irreversible damage would yield $C_{\\text{rec}} < 2\\,C_{48}$, contradicted by $C_{\\text{rec}} = 2\\,C_{48}$.\n\nTherefore, the data support that $4.0^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ is primarily bacteriostatic but also weakly bactericidal, and the static effect is reversible in survivors.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2059516"}]}
