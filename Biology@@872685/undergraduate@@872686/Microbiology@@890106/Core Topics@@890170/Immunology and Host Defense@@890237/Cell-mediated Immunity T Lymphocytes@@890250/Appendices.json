{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before T lymphocytes can patrol the body, they must undergo a rigorous education in the thymus. This process, known as thymic selection, ensures that only T cells capable of recognizing the body's own Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules survive, a principle called MHC restriction. This exercise explores the critical role of MHC class I molecules in the development of $CD8^+$ cytotoxic T cells by examining a hypothetical clinical case of MHC deficiency, demonstrating how a failure in thymic education leads to a specific gap in the immune arsenal [@problem_id:2057903].", "problem": "A pediatric immunologist is evaluating a young patient presenting with recurrent and severe viral infections, particularly from viruses like influenza and cytomegalovirus. Laboratory analysis reveals a rare genetic disorder known as Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome Type 1. This condition is caused by a mutation that completely prevents the expression of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules on the surface of all cells, while the expression of MHC class II molecules remains normal. Based on your understanding of T lymphocyte development in the thymus, which of the following immune cell populations would be expected to be almost entirely absent and non-functional in this patient?\n\nA. CD4+ Helper T cells\n\nB. B lymphocytes\n\nC. CD8+ Cytotoxic T cells\n\nD. Natural Killer (NK) cells\n\nE. Dendritic cells", "solution": "The key immunologic principle is thymic selection of T lymphocytes. Immature thymocytes enter the cortex as double-negative cells, progress to double-positive cells expressing both CD4 and CD8, and then undergo positive selection on cortical thymic epithelial cells. Positive selection requires that the T cell receptor recognize self-peptide presented on either MHC class I or MHC class II with appropriate, low-to-moderate affinity; recognition of self-peptide on MHC class I commits the cell to the CD8 lineage, whereas recognition on MHC class II commits the cell to the CD4 lineage. Cells that fail to recognize self-peptide on MHC at all die by neglect.\n\nIn Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome Type 1, there is a complete absence of MHC class I expression on all cells. In the thymic cortex, this means that double-positive thymocytes cannot receive survival signals through their T cell receptor that would arise from recognizing peptide bound to MHC class I. Consequently, there is no positive selection into the CD8 lineage, and double-positive thymocytes with potential CD8 specificity undergo apoptosis by neglect. Therefore, mature $CD8^+$ cytotoxic T lymphocytes are almost entirely absent and non-functional.\n\nBy contrast, MHC class II expression is normal, so positive selection into the CD4 lineage proceeds, and $CD4^+$ helper T cells develop normally. B lymphocytes develop in the bone marrow independently of thymic MHC-mediated selection and thus are present; while some functional antiviral responses are impaired due to the absence of $CD8^+$ T cells, B cell numbers are not absent. Natural killer cells do not require MHC class I for development in the same way as T cells; although their education involves interactions with self MHC class I and their activity is modulated by the presence or absence of MHC class I on target cells, they are not absent in MHC class I deficiency and may be relatively more active due to the missing-self phenomenon. Dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells whose development does not depend on thymic selection, and they remain present even if they cannot express MHC class I; they still express MHC class II normally.\n\nTherefore, the immune cell population expected to be almost entirely absent and non-functional in this patient is $CD8^+$ cytotoxic T cells.\n\nEvaluating the options:\nA. $CD4^+$ Helper T cells: develop normally because MHC class II is intact.\nB. B lymphocytes: present; development is independent of thymic MHC class I.\nC. $CD8^+$ Cytotoxic T cells: absent due to failed positive selection without MHC class I.\nD. Natural Killer cells: not absent; may show altered function but are present.\nE. Dendritic cells: present; development independent of thymic selection.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2057903"}, {"introduction": "An effective immune response is not just about molecular recognition; it is also a logistical challenge of getting the right cells to the right place at the right time. Once a naive T cell matures, it must travel to secondary lymphoid organs, like lymph nodes, to survey for antigens presented by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This practice uses a scenario involving a deficiency in the chemokine receptor $CCR7$ to illustrate the essential process of T cell homing, revealing the molecular \"GPS\" system that guides T cells to the sites of immune activation [@problem_id:2057897].", "problem": "In a laboratory setting, a mouse model is engineered to study the process of T-cell activation. Following a localized subcutaneous infection with a non-lethal bacterium in the footpad, professional Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells, successfully capture bacterial antigens, mature, and migrate from the site of infection. Concurrently, naive T-lymphocytes, which have successfully completed their development in the thymus, are circulating throughout the body.\n\nA specific population of these naive T-lymphocytes has been genetically modified to have a homozygous null mutation in the gene encoding the chemokine receptor CCR7. All other aspects of these T-cells, including their T-cell receptor repertoire and the expression of co-stimulatory molecules like CD28, are normal.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome for these CCR7-deficient naive T-lymphocytes in their response to the infection?\n\nA. The T-cells will fail to become activated because they cannot efficiently migrate into the secondary lymphoid organs where the mature APCs are presenting the bacterial antigens.\n\nB. The T-cells will be successfully activated by the APCs directly at the site of infection in the peripheral tissue (the footpad).\n\nC. The T-cells will successfully migrate into the secondary lymphoid organs but will be unable to form a stable immunological synapse with the APCs, thus failing activation.\n\nD. The T-cells will be activated normally, as CCR7 is primarily required for the exit of activated effector T-cells from the lymphoid organs, not for the activation of naive T-cells.\n\nE. The T-cells will undergo apoptosis in the bloodstream because the lack of CCR7 signaling is essential for their survival in circulation.", "solution": "Naive T-lymphocytes are activated when they encounter antigen-bearing professional Antigen-Presenting Cells in the T-cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs, especially the draining lymph node for a localized infection. After infection in peripheral tissue, dendritic cells capture antigen, upregulate CCR7, and migrate via afferent lymphatics to the draining lymph node in response to the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21, where they present antigen to naive T cells.\n\nNaive T cells normally home to lymph nodes via high endothelial venules using a multistep adhesion cascade: L-selectin (CD62L) mediates rolling; engagement of CCR7 on the T cell by CCL19 and CCL21 displayed on HEV triggers inside-out activation of integrins such as LFA-1, enabling firm adhesion to ICAM-1 and subsequent diapedesis into the lymph node paracortex. CCR7 signaling also guides interstitial migration and positioning of naive T cells within the T-cell zone to optimize encounters with dendritic cells.\n\nIf naive T cells are CCR7-deficient, they cannot sense CCL19 and CCL21. Consequently, they exhibit markedly impaired entry into lymph nodes via HEV due to deficient chemokine-triggered integrin activation, and even if they enter, they fail to localize appropriately within the T-cell zone. Therefore, they will not efficiently encounter antigen-bearing dendritic cells in the draining lymph node and will fail to become activated.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is correct: without CCR7, naive T cells cannot efficiently migrate into and position within secondary lymphoid organs to meet APCs, leading to failed activation.\n- Option B is incorrect: naive T cells are not typically activated in peripheral non-lymphoid tissues; initial priming occurs in secondary lymphoid organs.\n- Option C is incorrect: formation of the immunological synapse depends on TCR recognition, costimulation (e.g., CD28), and integrins like LFA-1; CCR7 is not required for synapse formation per se.\n- Option D is incorrect: egress from lymphoid organs is primarily regulated by S1P receptor signaling (not CCR7); CCR7 is crucial for entry and positioning.\n- Option E is incorrect: CCR7 signaling is not essential for survival in circulation; survival signals are more dependent on IL-7 and tonic TCR interactions.\n\nThus, the most accurate prediction is that these CCR7-deficient naive T cells will fail to become activated because they cannot efficiently migrate into secondary lymphoid organs to encounter mature APCs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2057897"}, {"introduction": "The activation of a T cell is a tightly controlled decision, requiring more than just the recognition of a foreign antigen to prevent accidental attacks on the body's own tissues. This core principle is captured in the \"two-signal model\" of lymphocyte activation. This problem delves into this crucial safety mechanism by exploring what happens when a T cell receives the first signal (antigen recognition via its TCR) but lacks the receptor $CD28$ needed for the second, co-stimulatory signal, leading to a state of tolerance known as anergy [@problem_id:2057842].", "problem": "A researcher is investigating a rare genetic disorder that affects the adaptive immune system. Patients with this disorder exhibit a specific mutation that prevents their T lymphocytes from synthesizing and expressing the CD28 surface protein. All other cellular functions and surface proteins, including the T Cell Receptor (TCR), are normal.\n\nTo study the functional consequence of this defect, the researcher isolates naive T cells from a patient and co-cultures them with professional Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs). These APCs have been pulsed with a specific peptide antigen and are confirmed to be expressing both the appropriate Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules presenting the antigen and the co-stimulatory B7 proteins (CD80/CD86).

The T cells will be unaffected and remain in a naive state, as if they had never encountered the APC.", "solution": "T lymphocyte activation requires at least two signals:\n- Signal 1: Antigen-specific recognition via the T Cell Receptor (TCR) engaging peptide presented on MHC of an APC.\n- Signal 2: Co-stimulation, classically mediated by CD28 on the T cell binding B7 proteins (CD80/CD86) on the APC.\n\nIn the described setup, the APCs present the correct peptide-MHC complex and express B7, so Signal 1 is available and the co-stimulatory ligands are present. However, the patient’s T cells lack CD28, so they cannot receive Signal 2 despite B7 expression on the APCs.\n\nThe established immunologic principle is that naive T cells that receive Signal 1 in the absence of Signal 2 do not undergo full activation; instead, they enter a state of anergy, becoming functionally unresponsive to subsequent antigen encounters. This outcome is distinct from:\n- Full activation with clonal expansion and differentiation (which requires both signals),\n- Immediate apoptosis (which is not the canonical immediate outcome of Signal 1 without Signal 2 in naive T cells; deletion can occur in some contexts but the classic consequence is anergy),\n- Differentiation into memory T cells without primary activation (which does not occur),\n- Remaining naive and unaffected (they do receive Signal 1, which induces tolerance/anergy rather than leaving them unchanged).\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is anergy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2057842"}]}
