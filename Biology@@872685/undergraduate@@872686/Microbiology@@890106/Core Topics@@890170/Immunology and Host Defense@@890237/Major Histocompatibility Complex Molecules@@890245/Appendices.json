{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To begin our practical exploration of MHC molecules, we first examine the MHC class I pathway, which is our immune system's primary surveillance mechanism for intracellular threats like viruses. This exercise challenges you to think like an immunologist by connecting a specific molecular defect to a functional outcome. By considering a partial deficiency in the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) complex, you will trace the steps of antigen presentation and deduce its impact on antiviral immunity [@problem_id:2076610].", "problem": "The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules are critical for the adaptive immune response against intracellular pathogens. In a normal cell, proteins synthesized within the cytoplasm (e.g., viral proteins) are degraded into small peptides. These peptides are then transported from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum by a protein complex called the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP). The TAP complex is a heterodimer composed of TAP1 and TAP2 subunits. Inside the endoplasmic reticulum, these peptides bind to MHC class I molecules, which are then trafficked to the cell surface for presentation to CD8$^+$ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).\n\nConsider an individual who is heterozygous for a defective allele of the `TAP2` gene. This means they possess one functional `TAP2` allele and one non-functional `TAP2` allele. As a result, their cells produce a reduced quantity of functional TAP complexes, leading to less efficient transport of peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum compared to an individual with two functional alleles.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following outcomes is the most likely immunological consequence for this individual?\n\nA. Increased susceptibility to viral infections.\n\nB. Increased susceptibility to infections by extracellular bacteria.\n\nC. A specific inability to activate CD4$^+$ helper T cells.\n\nD. Normal immune function, as the single functional allele provides sufficient compensation.\n\nE. An overactive inflammatory response leading to chronic autoimmunity.", "solution": "Logical steps:\n1) State the pathway and requirement for MHC class I antigen presentation: Endogenous proteins in the cytosol are degraded by the proteasome into peptides. Peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum by the TAP complex (heterodimer of TAP1 and TAP2). In the ER, peptides bind to MHC class I heavy chain associated with beta-2 microglobulin, stabilizing the complex. Properly loaded MHC class I complexes traffic to the cell surface to present peptides to $CD8^+$ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, enabling recognition and killing of infected cells.\n\n2) Link TAP function to MHC class I surface expression and $CD8^+$ T cell responses: Efficient peptide transport by TAP is necessary for stable peptide loading onto MHC class I. Reduced TAP function leads to fewer peptide-loaded MHC class I molecules, decreased stability and surface expression of MHC class I, and impaired activation and effector function of $CD8^+$ cytotoxic T lymphocytes.\n\n3) Apply the heterozygous TAP2 defect given in the stem: The problem explicitly stipulates that one non-functional and one functional TAP2 allele results in reduced quantity of functional TAP complexes and less efficient peptide transport. Therefore, there will be a partial reduction in MHC class I peptide loading and surface expression, causing a relative impairment of $CD8^+$ T cell–mediated immunity against intracellular pathogens.\n\n4) Infer the immunological consequence most directly affected: Impaired MHC class I presentation and $CD8^+$ cytotoxic T cell responses primarily compromise defense against intracellular pathogens, especially viruses, which rely on cell-mediated cytotoxicity for clearance.\n\n5) Exclude incorrect options:\n- B (extracellular bacteria): Primarily handled by humoral immunity and $CD4^+$ T cell help via MHC class II; not the principal deficit in reduced TAP function.\n- C ($CD4^+$ helper T cells): Activation depends on MHC class II, invariant chain, CLIP, and HLA-DM, not TAP; thus not specifically impaired by TAP2 heterozygosity.\n- D (normal immune function): The stem states there is reduced TAP function and less efficient peptide transport; thus not fully normal.\n- E (overactive inflammation/autoimmunity): A TAP2 reduction would not be expected to cause an overactive inflammatory response; the predicted defect is diminished $CD8^+$ responses, not autoimmunity.\n\nConclusion: The most likely consequence is increased susceptibility to viral infections.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2076610"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the pathway for internal antigens, we now turn our attention to the MHC class II pathway, which handles threats from the extracellular environment. This problem focuses on the indispensable role of the invariant chain (Ii), a molecular chaperone that ensures MHC class II molecules are correctly trafficked and loaded with peptides from external sources. By analyzing the consequences of an invariant chain deficiency, you will deepen your understanding of how the immune system distinguishes between intracellular and extracellular antigens [@problem_id:2076655].", "problem": "An immunologist is studying a rare genetic disorder affecting the adaptive immune system. The disorder is caused by a null mutation in the gene encoding the invariant chain (Ii), a protein crucial for antigen presentation. This mutation leads to a complete absence of the Ii protein in all relevant cell types. Consider a B lymphocyte from an individual with this condition that has successfully internalized an exogenous bacterial protein antigen via its B cell receptor. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the primary functional consequence for this B cell's role as an antigen-presenting cell (APC)?\n\nA. The B cell will be unable to present peptides from endogenous (self) proteins on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I molecules to CD8$^+$ cytotoxic T cells.\n\nB. The B cell will fail to properly load peptides from the exogenous bacterial protein onto Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class II molecules for presentation at the cell surface.\n\nC. The B cell's ability to internalize the exogenous bacterial protein via receptor-mediated endocytosis will be completely blocked.\n\nD. The B cell will successfully present the bacterial peptides on MHC Class II molecules but will incorrectly activate CD8$^+$ cytotoxic T cells instead of CD4$^+$ helper T cells.\n\nE. The MHC Class II molecules will be successfully transported to the cell surface, but they will be loaded exclusively with peptides derived from self-proteins found within the endoplasmic reticulum.", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the normal role of the invariant chain (Ii) in MHC class II antigen presentation. In professional antigen-presenting cells (including B cells), MHC class II alpha and beta chains assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum with the invariant chain. The invariant chain:\n- Occupies the peptide-binding groove to prevent premature binding of endogenous peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum.\n- Provides sorting signals that target the MHC class II complex to the endosomal/lysosomal compartments (MIIC), where exogenously derived proteins have been internalized and processed.\n- Is progressively cleaved to leave CLIP in the groove, which is subsequently exchanged for high-affinity peptides derived from the exogenous antigen with the aid of HLA-DM.\n\nStep 2: Determine the consequence of a null Ii mutation. In the complete absence of invariant chain:\n- MHC class II molecules do not receive proper targeting signals and therefore are not efficiently delivered to the MIIC compartments where exogenous antigens are processed.\n- The peptide-binding groove is unprotected in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to unstable MHC class II and/or aberrant binding of endogenous peptides, with many complexes retained and degraded rather than reaching the surface.\n- CLIP is not generated, and HLA-DM–mediated peptide exchange for exogenously derived peptides in the MIIC cannot occur.\n\nStep 3: Apply these consequences to a B cell that has internalized an exogenous bacterial protein via its B cell receptor. Although receptor-mediated endocytosis by the B cell receptor remains intact (this process does not require Ii), the MHC class II pathway is critically dependent on Ii for both trafficking to the correct compartment and proper peptide loading. Therefore, the B cell will fail to properly load exogenous bacterial peptides onto MHC class II and will largely be unable to present these peptides to CD4 helper T cells at the surface.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the answer choices based on these principles.\n- A is incorrect: MHC class I presentation of endogenous peptides uses the proteasome, TAP, and loading in the endoplasmic reticulum, and does not require invariant chain.\n- B is correct: Without invariant chain, proper loading of exogenous peptides onto MHC class II fails due to defective trafficking to MIIC and absence of CLIP/HLA-DM–facilitated exchange.\n- C is incorrect: B cell receptor–mediated endocytosis of antigen is independent of invariant chain.\n- D is incorrect: The absence of invariant chain does not cause misdirection to CD8 cytotoxic T cells; rather, it impairs MHC class II presentation to CD4 helper T cells.\n- E is incorrect: Invariant chain deficiency does not lead to successful surface expression of MHC class II exclusively loaded with endoplasmic reticulum self-peptides; instead, MHC class II is unstable, mistrafficked, and largely degraded, with markedly reduced and dysfunctional surface expression.\n\nHence, the primary functional consequence is failure of exogenous antigen loading onto MHC class II for presentation at the cell surface.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2076655"}, {"introduction": "This final practice serves as a capstone, integrating your knowledge of both the MHC class I and class II pathways.

Their assembly and stable surface expression require peptide loading in the endoplasmic reticulum, which depends on the TAP complex. MHC class I expression is necessary for positive selection of CD8$^+$ T cells in the thymus. If MHC class I is absent or markedly reduced, positive selection of CD8$^+$ thymocytes fails, leading to a severe deficiency of CD8$^+$ T cells in the periphery, while CD4$^+$ T cells can remain near normal if MHC class II is intact.\n\nPrinciple 2: MHC class II molecules present peptides derived from extracellular proteins. Expression of MHC class II requires transcriptional activation by factors such as CIITA and the RFX complex. MHC class II expression on thymic epithelial cells and antigen-presenting cells is necessary for positive selection and peripheral maintenance of CD4$^+$ T cells. If MHC class II is absent, positive selection of CD4$^+$ thymocytes fails, causing a severe deficiency of CD4$^+$ T cells in the periphery, while CD8$^+$ T cells can remain near normal if MHC class I is intact.\n\nApplication to Patient A (BLS Type I, TAP deficiency):\n- Defect: Loss of TAP function impairs peptide transport into the endoplasmic reticulum.\n- Consequence: MHC class I molecules are not properly peptide-loaded, become unstable, and have markedly reduced surface expression.\n- Thymic selection effect: Positive selection of CD8$^+$ thymocytes fails due to lack of MHC class I, causing a severe deficiency of CD8$^+$ T cells.\n- CD4$^+$ T cells: MHC class II pathway is intact; positive selection proceeds, so CD4$^+$ T-cell numbers are near normal relative to a healthy individual.\n\nApplication to Patient B (BLS Type II, CIITA or related transcription factor deficiency):\n- Defect: Loss of CIITA-dependent transcription prevents expression of all MHC class II genes.\n- Consequence: Absence of MHC class II on thymic epithelial cells and antigen-presenting cells.\n- Thymic selection effect: Positive selection of CD4$^+$ thymocytes fails, causing a severe deficiency of CD4$^+$ T cells.\n- CD8$^+$ T cells: MHC class I pathway is intact; positive selection proceeds, so CD8$^+$ T-cell numbers are near normal relative to a healthy individual.\n\nComparison with options:\n- Option A states Patient A is severely deficient in CD8$^+$ with near-normal CD4$^+$, and Patient B is severely deficient in CD4$^+$ with near-normal CD8$^+$.
