The cells are actively carrying out glycolysis via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway. For an experiment, the standard glucose is replaced with a specially synthesized glucose molecule that is isotopically labeled with Carbon-14 ($^{14}\\text{C}$) exclusively at the C-1 position (the aldehydic carbon). The resulting product of glycolysis is pyruvate. Assuming the pathway proceeds to completion, at which position will the $^{14}\\text{C}$ label be found in the pyruvate molecules?\n\nFor pyruvate ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{COCOO}^{-}$), the carbon atoms are numbered as follows: C-1 is the carbon in the carboxyl group, C-2 is the carbon in the carbonyl group, and C-3 is the carbon in the methyl group.\n\nA.
