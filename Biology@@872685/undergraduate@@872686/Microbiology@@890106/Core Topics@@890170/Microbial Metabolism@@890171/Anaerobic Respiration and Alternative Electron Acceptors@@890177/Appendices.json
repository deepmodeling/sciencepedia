Consider a bacterium that performs complete denitrification, converting nitrate ($NO_3^-$) into dinitrogen gas ($N_2$). For a metabolic process in which exactly two molecules of nitrate are reduced to form one molecule of dinitrogen gas, determine the total number of electrons accepted.", "solution": "Denitrification reduces nitrate to dinitrogen. The number of electrons accepted is determined by the change in oxidation state of nitrogen and confirmed by balancing the redox half-reaction using conservation of mass and charge.\n\nFirst, assign oxidation states. In $NO_3^-$, taking oxygen as $-2$, the nitrogen oxidation state is found from $x + 3(-2) = -1$, giving $x = +5$. In $N_2$, each nitrogen is in the elemental state with oxidation number $0$. Thus, each nitrogen atom undergoes a reduction from $+5$ to $0$, which corresponds to a gain of $5$ electrons per nitrogen atom.\n\nSince two nitrate ions contain two nitrogen atoms that end up in one $N_2$ molecule, the total electrons accepted are $2 \\times 5 = 10$.\n\nThis is confirmed by writing and balancing the acidic half-reaction:\n$$\n2\\,NO_3^{-} \\to N_2\n$$\nBalance oxygen with water:\n$$\n2\\,NO_3^{-} \\to N_2 + 6\\,H_2O\n$$\nBalance hydrogen with protons:\n$$\n2\\,NO_3^{-} + 12\\,H^{+} \\to N_2 + 6\\,H_2O\n$$\nBalance charge with electrons on the left (reduction):\nThe left-side charge before electrons is $2(-1) + 12(+1) = +10$, while the right side is $0$, so add $10$ electrons to the left:\n$$\n2\\,NO_3^{-} + 12\\,H^{+} + 10\\,e^{-} \\to N_2 + 6\\,H_2O\n$$\nTherefore, exactly $10$ electrons are accepted when two nitrate ions are reduced to one dinitrogen molecule.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "2051454"}, {"introduction": "After mastering the stoichiometry of electron transfer, the next logical question is: what is the biological benefit? This thought experiment directly addresses this by comparing the growth yield of a microbe under fermentative versus respiratory conditions.
