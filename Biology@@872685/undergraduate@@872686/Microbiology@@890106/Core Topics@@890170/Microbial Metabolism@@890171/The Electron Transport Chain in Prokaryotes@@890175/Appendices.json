The bacterium is inoculated into a sealed, limited-volume chemostat containing a rich broth. The initial conditions include dissolved oxygen from aeration, as well as significant concentrations of both nitrate ($\\text{NO}_3^-$) and nitrite ($\\text{NO}_2^-$) added as supplements. As the bacterium grows, it is expected to consume these terminal electron acceptors in the order that is thermodynamically most favorable. Your task is to predict the sequence in which the primary terminal reductase enzymes will become predominantly active as the culture progresses from an aerobic to a fully anaerobic state and depletes the available acceptors.\n\nThe three relevant terminal reductases and their corresponding redox reactions (at standard conditions, pH 7) are:\n- **Cytochrome Oxidase**:\n$$ O_2 + 4H^{+} + 4e^{-} \\to 2H_2O $$\nwith a standard redox potential ($E'^{\\circ}$) of +0.82 V.\n- **Nitrate Reductase**:\n$$ \\text{NO}_3^- + 2H^{+} + 2e^{-} \\to \\text{NO}_2^- + H_2O $$\nwith an $E'^{\\circ}$ of +0.42 V.\n- **Nitrite Reductase**: For this organism, it catalyzes the reduction to ammonium:\n$$ \\text{NO}_2^- + 8H^{+} + 6e^{-} \\to \\text{NH}_4^+ + 2H_2O $$\nwith an $E'^{\\circ}$ of +0.34 V.\n\nWhich of the following sequences correctly describes the order of predominant activity for these enzymes in the culture?\n\nA) Nitrate reductase, then Nitrite reductase, then Cytochrome oxidase\n\nB) Cytochrome oxidase, then Nitrate reductase, then Nitrite reductase\n\nC) Cytochrome oxidase, then Nitrite reductase, then Nitrate reductase\n\nD) Nitrite reductase, then Nitrate reductase, then Cytochrome oxidase\n\nE) Nitrate reductase, then Cytochrome oxidase, then Nitrite reductase", "solution": "The governing thermodynamic principle for respiratory electron transport is that cells preferentially use the terminal electron acceptor that yields the most negative Gibbs free energy change per electron transferred. The relationship between the change in Gibbs free energy at biochemical standard conditions and the redox potential difference is\n$$\n\\Delta G'^{\\circ}=-nF\\Delta E'^{\\circ},\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of electrons transferred, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and\n$$\n\\Delta E'^{\\circ}=E'^{\\circ}_{\\text{acceptor}}-E'^{\\circ}_{\\text{donor}}.\n$$\nFor a given electron donor pool in the cell (for example, reduced quinones or NADH with fixed $E'^{\\circ}_{\\text{donor}}$), making $\\Delta G'^{\\circ}$ as negative as possible is equivalent to maximizing $E'^{\\circ}_{\\text{acceptor}}$. Therefore, the preferred terminal electron acceptor is the one with the highest $E'^{\\circ}$, and the order of utilization follows the descending order of $E'^{\\circ}_{\\text{acceptor}}$ among the available acceptors.\n\nThe listed terminal acceptors and their $E'^{\\circ}$ values at pH 7 are:\n- Oxygen reduction via cytochrome oxidase: $E'^{\\circ}=+0.82\\ \\text{V}$.\n- Nitrate reduction to nitrite via nitrate reductase: $E'^{\\circ}=+0.42\\ \\text{V}$.\n- Nitrite reduction to ammonium via nitrite reductase: $E'^{\\circ}=+0.34\\ \\text{V}$.\n\nRanking these by $E'^{\\circ}$ gives\n$$\n+0.82\\ \\text{V} > +0.42\\ \\text{V} > +0.34\\ \\text{V}.\n$$\nThus, as the culture begins with dissolved oxygen present, cytochrome oxidase predominates first because oxygen offers the highest $E'^{\\circ}$ and thus the most negative $\\Delta G'^{\\circ}$ for a given donor. As oxygen is depleted in the sealed system, the bacterium shifts to the next most favorable acceptor, nitrate, engaging nitrate reductase. After nitrate becomes limiting or is depleted, the remaining nitrite is used, and nitrite reductase predominates to reduce nitrite to ammonium. This thermodynamic hierarchy is also reinforced by common regulatory hierarchies in facultative anaerobes, where oxygen represses anaerobic reductases and nitrate often represses downstream reductases until nitrate is scarce.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of predominant enzyme activities is cytochrome oxidase, then nitrate reductase, then nitrite reductase, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2097472"}, {"introduction": "The crucial link between the electron transport chain (ETC) and ATP synthesis is the proton motive force (PMF), a concept central to the chemiosmotic theory. To truly grasp this elegant coupling mechanism, it is highly instructive to examine what happens when it is intentionally broken. This exercise uses a classic thought experiment involving the chemical uncoupler DNP to explore the principles of respiratory control, revealing how the rate of electron transport is finely tuned to the cell's energetic demand for ATP.

The cellular machinery of these bacteria couples electron transport to the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via a proton motive force across their cytoplasmic membrane. A scientist introduces a chemical agent, 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), into the chamber. DNP is a known uncoupling agent; it is a lipid-soluble molecule that can bind protons and freely diffuse across the prokaryotic cytoplasmic membrane, effectively acting as a proton shuttle.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the immediate effect of adding DNP on the rate of oxygen consumption by the *Paracoccus denitrificans* culture?\n\nA. The rate of oxygen consumption will decrease because the inhibition of ATP synthesis signals the cell to conserve energy.\n\nB. The rate of oxygen consumption will increase because the electron transport chain will operate at a maximal rate.\n\nC. The rate of oxygen consumption will cease entirely because the proton motive force is essential for electron transport.\n\nD. The rate of oxygen consumption will remain unchanged because the availability of succinate is the rate-limiting factor.\n\nE. The rate of oxygen consumption will oscillate as the cell attempts to re-establish membrane potential.", "solution": "We analyze oxidative phosphorylation in an obligate aerobe with a non-fermentable carbon source and ample $\\mathrm{O_{2}}$. In such cells, electron transport from a reduced substrate to $\\mathrm{O_{2}}$ via the electron transport chain (ETC) pumps protons across the cytoplasmic membrane, generating a proton motive force (PMF), which drives ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase. The PMF is given by the chemiosmotic relation\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\Delta \\psi - \\frac{2.303\\,R\\,T}{F}\\,\\Delta \\mathrm{pH},\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta \\psi$ is the transmembrane electrical potential, $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ is the pH gradient, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $F$ is Faraday’s constant.\n\nUnder tight coupling (no uncoupler), respiratory control arises because ATP synthase consumption of the PMF prevents its excessive buildup when ADP is available, enabling rapid electron flow; conversely, when ATP synthesis slows (e.g., low ADP), the PMF rises, imposing thermodynamic backpressure on the proton pumps, which slows the ETC and lowers the rate of $\\mathrm{O_{2}}$ consumption. Thus, under normal conditions, the rate of $\\mathrm{O_{2}}$ consumption is constrained by the extent to which the PMF can be dissipated by ATP synthase activity.\n\nIntroducing 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), a lipid-soluble protonophore, short-circuits the PMF by binding protons on the acidic side, diffusing across the membrane, and releasing protons on the basic side. This collapses both $\\Delta \\psi$ and $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$, thereby driving $\\Delta p \\to 0$. With $\\Delta p$ dissipated:\n- ATP synthase lacks the driving force for ATP production, so ATP synthesis falls sharply.\n- The proton pumps in the ETC are relieved of backpressure, because the work needed to pump each proton against $\\Delta p$ is minimized. Consequently, the redox reactions in the ETC can proceed at their maximal rate permitted by enzyme kinetics and substrate availability, provided $\\mathrm{O_{2}}$ and electron donors (succinate via succinate dehydrogenase) remain abundant.\n\nTherefore, the immediate effect of DNP is to increase the rate of electron transport and thus increase the rate of $\\mathrm{O_{2}}$ consumption. This corresponds to classical uncoupling: the P/O ratio drops, heat production rises, and respiration accelerates.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect: although ATP synthesis decreases, the immediate biophysical effect of uncoupling is not conservation but removal of respiratory control, which increases ETC flux and $\\mathrm{O_{2}}$ consumption.\n- B is correct: uncoupling drives the ETC toward its maximal rate, increasing $\\mathrm{O_{2}}$ consumption.\n- C is incorrect: the PMF is a product of ETC activity, not a prerequisite; ETC can operate without a sustained PMF if it is being dissipated by an uncoupler.\n- D is incorrect: succinate is saturating, so it is not rate-limiting in this scenario.\n- E is incorrect: DNP persistently dissipates $\\Delta p$, preventing re-establishment and thus preventing oscillatory recovery; the effect is a sustained high respiration rate.\n\nHence, the most accurate prediction is an increase in the rate of oxygen consumption.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2097462"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate measure of respiratory efficiency is the amount of ATP generated.
