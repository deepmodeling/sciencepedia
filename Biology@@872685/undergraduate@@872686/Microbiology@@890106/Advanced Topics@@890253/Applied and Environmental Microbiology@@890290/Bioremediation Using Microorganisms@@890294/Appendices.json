This problem delves into the important concept of cometabolism, where an enzyme acting on a primary growth substrate fortuitously degrades a second compound, such as a pollutant [@problem_id:2056183]. Understanding the logic of cometabolism is key to designing and maintaining successful remediation projects that rely on this powerful but dependent mechanism.", "problem": "In a bioremediation project, a specific strain of bacterium, *Methylomonas methanica*, is utilized to clean up an aquifer contaminated with trichloroethylene (TCE), a toxic industrial solvent. This bacterium uses methane ($CH_{4}$) as its sole primary substrate for both energy production and growth. The key enzyme in this process is methane monooxygenase (MMO), which catalyzes the initial oxidation of methane. It has been observed that MMO can also fortuitously catalyze the initial step in the degradation of TCE, a process known as cometabolism. The degradation of TCE via this pathway does not provide the bacterium with any usable energy or carbon.\n\nAssuming the bioremediation process is initially successful, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental biochemical reason for why the degradation of TCE would eventually stop if the supply of methane to the aquifer is depleted?\n\nA. The synthesis of methane monooxygenase is metabolically coupled to the consumption of methane. Since the degradation of TCE does not support the bacterium's growth or energy needs, the bacterium ceases to produce the enzyme when its primary growth substrate is absent.\n\nB. The degradation of TCE is an energetically expensive reaction that requires a direct input of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). The cell can no longer generate sufficient ATP through its central metabolism once its primary substrate, methane, is exhausted.\n\nC. As methane is depleted, the concentration of TCE increases to a level that is directly toxic to *Methylomonas methanica*, causing widespread cell death and thus halting all metabolic activity.\n\nD. Trichloroethylene (TCE) itself functions as a transcriptional repressor for the gene encoding methane monooxygenase. In the absence of methane, TCE binds to the operator region of the gene, actively preventing the synthesis of the enzyme.\n\nE. The breakdown products of TCE are acidic, and without the buffering capacity provided by active methane metabolism, the intracellular pH of the bacteria drops, causing the methane monooxygenase enzyme to denature and lose its function.", "solution": "We begin by stating the relevant biochemical framework. The bacterium is an obligate methanotroph that uses methane as its sole primary substrate for both energy (reducing power and ATP via oxidative phosphorylation) and carbon for biosynthesis. Methane monooxygenase (MMO) catalyzes the oxidation of methane and, fortuitously, cometabolizes trichloroethylene (TCE). By definition of cometabolism, the transformation of TCE does not yield usable energy or assimilable carbon for the organism. Therefore, the cell’s capacity to maintain metabolism, synthesize proteins, and sustain enzyme activity depends on the continued availability of methane.\n\nThe key principles are:\n*   Induction and synthesis of MMO depend on the cell’s metabolism geared to methane oxidation; in methanotrophs, expression of MMO is regulated by environmental and metabolic signals tied to methane availability (and copper status for pMMO vs sMMO), and synthesis requires energy and reducing power derived from growth on methane.\n*   The MMO-catalyzed reaction does not draw ATP directly; MMO uses reducing equivalents (e.g., NADH or quinol) supplied by central metabolism driven by methane oxidation. Without methane, the cell neither generates reducing power nor maintains the metabolic state that supports MMO expression and function.\n*   Because TCE cometabolism provides neither energy nor carbon, TCE alone cannot sustain growth, maintenance, or continued enzyme production. Consequently, once methane is depleted, MMO synthesis and activity decline and TCE degradation ceases.\n\nWe now evaluate each option against these principles:\n*   Option A: States that MMO synthesis is metabolically coupled to methane consumption and that TCE degradation does not support growth or energy needs; thus, in the absence of methane, the bacterium ceases producing MMO. This matches the regulatory and energetic logic of cometabolism: no primary substrate means no induction/maintenance of MMO and no metabolic support for its synthesis.\n*   Option B: Claims TCE degradation requires direct ATP. MMO does not consume ATP directly; it uses reducing equivalents. While cellular ATP would indeed diminish after methane depletion, the core reason TCE degradation stops is not that the reaction directly requires ATP but that the enzyme is no longer induced or maintained and reducing power is not generated. Hence, B misattributes the energetic requirement.\n*   Option C: Posits toxicity from increased TCE concentration as methane is depleted. Methane depletion does not intrinsically increase TCE concentration; moreover, although TCE or its epoxides can be toxic, this is not the fundamental, general reason tied to methane depletion that explains cessation of cometabolism.\n*   Option D: Asserts TCE acts as a transcriptional repressor by binding the operator of the MMO gene. There is no basis for TCE functioning as a specific operator-binding repressor of MMO; regulation is tied to methane availability and copper, not TCE repression.\n*   Option E: Suggests acidic breakdown products of TCE lower intracellular pH leading to enzyme denaturation when methane metabolism ceases. Cells maintain pH homeostasis via multiple systems; this mechanism is speculative and not the fundamental, widely applicable reason for cessation of cometabolism upon methane depletion.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental biochemical reason is that MMO synthesis and maintenance are metabolically linked to growth on methane; TCE cometabolism does not support energy or growth, so enzyme production and activity cease when methane is absent.
