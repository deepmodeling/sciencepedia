The bioreactor has a working volume of 950 L of culture medium. As the cell density and protein production increase, significant foaming occurs due to the sparging of air for aeration and the presence of proteins that act as surfactants. This foam poses a risk of blocking the exhaust gas filter, leading to pressure buildup and potential contamination.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, the production team decides to add a sterile, food-grade, silicone-based antifoam agent. The stock solution of this antifoam agent has a concentration of 25% (v/v).

This is often achieved by strategically manipulating the composition of the growth medium. This problem explores how nutrient limitation, specifically by creating a high carbon-to-nitrogen ($\\text{C}:\\text{N}$) ratio, acts as a metabolic switch to shift bacteria from a growth phase to a production phase for valuable storage compounds like bioplastics. [@problem_id:2074108]", "problem": "A biotechnology firm is developing a two-stage fermentation process to produce Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), a class of biodegradable bioplastics, using the bacterium *Cupriavidus necator*. The first stage is designed for rapid cell proliferation to achieve a high cell density, providing a balanced growth medium rich in all necessary nutrients. The second stage is the production phase, where the primary objective is to maximize the synthesis and intracellular accumulation of PHA granules by the existing bacterial population. The medium for this second stage contains a primary carbon source (e.g., glucose) and a primary nitrogen source (e.g., ammonium sulfate), along with other essential trace minerals.\n\nTo trigger the metabolic shift from cell growth to PHA storage in the second stage, how should the initial concentration ratio of the carbon source to the nitrogen source (C:N ratio) in the fermentation medium be adjusted, compared to the ratio used for optimal growth in the first stage?\n\nA. The C:N ratio should be significantly decreased.\n\nB. The C:N ratio should be significantly increased.\n\nC. The C:N ratio should be kept identical to the optimal growth ratio.\n\nD. Both carbon and nitrogen sources should be completely removed, and only trace elements provided.", "solution": "Define the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio as $R=\\frac{[C]}{[N]}$, where $[C]$ and $[N]$ denote the initial concentrations of the primary carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively.\n\nPrinciple 1 (growth vs. storage): During balanced, rapid growth (stage 1), cells require both carbon and nitrogen for biomass synthesis; biomass contains substantial nitrogen (e.g., proteins, nucleic acids). Thus an $R$ optimized for growth supplies neither carbon nor nitrogen in strong excess, preventing nutrient limitation and maximizing the specific growth rate.\n\nPrinciple 2 (PHA physiology): Polyhydroxyalkanoates are intracellular carbon and energy storage polymers that are largely nitrogen-free. PHA accumulation is induced under conditions where growth is limited by an essential nutrient other than carbon (commonly nitrogen), while carbon remains in excess. Under nitrogen limitation, anabolic nitrogen-requiring pathways slow, but carbon uptake and reducing equivalents (e.g., NADPH) can still accumulate, diverting acetyl-CoA and reducing power into PHA synthesis.\n\nFormal condition for triggering storage: To enforce nitrogen limitation with carbon excess, choose $[C]$ sufficiently high and $[N]$ sufficiently low so that carbon uptake is at or near saturation while growth is constrained by nitrogen. In Monod terms, this corresponds to\n$$\n\\frac{[C]}{K_{s,C}+[C]} \\approx 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{[N]}{K_{s,N}+[N]} \\ll 1,\n$$\nwhich is achieved by increasing $R$ compared to its growth-optimized value. Since PHA synthesis consumes carbon but not nitrogen, a higher $R$ sustains polymer accumulation once nitrogen becomes limiting for biomass formation.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A (decrease $R$) increases nitrogen relative to carbon, preventing nitrogen limitation and favoring continued growth, not storage.\n- B (increase $R$) creates carbon excess with nitrogen limitation, the canonical trigger for PHA accumulation.\n- C (keep $R$ identical) maintains growth-optimized conditions, not inducing storage.\n- D (remove both C and N) starves cells; without carbon there is no substrate for PHA synthesis.\n\nConclusion: The second stage should employ a significantly higher carbon-to-nitrogen ratio than the first-stage growth medium, i.e., $R_{\\text{production}} \\gg R_{\\text{growth}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2074108"}, {"introduction": "When a fermentation process deviates from its expected course, a microbiologist must act as a detective, using process data to diagnose the underlying biological cause. This problem presents a classic troubleshooting scenario where antibiotic production has failed and the culture's pH is drifting in an unexpected direction. Your task is to analyze the metabolic clues to identify the most likely type of microbial contaminant responsible for the failure, a critical skill in industrial quality control. [@problem_id:2074099]", "problem": "A biotechnology company is running a large-scale fed-batch fermentation to produce the antibiotic erythromycin using the filamentous bacterium *Saccharopolyspora erythraea*. The process is conducted under strictly aerobic conditions in a complex sterile medium containing glucose as the primary carbon source and peptones and soy meal as the primary nitrogen sources. The culture pH is typically maintained at a constant optimum of 7.0. Midway through a production run, operators notice two simultaneous, undesirable trends: first, the rate of erythromycin synthesis has decreased dramatically, and second, the pH of the culture has begun a steady, unexpected rise, drifting towards 8.5 despite the control system's efforts. The dissolved oxygen concentration remains stable, indicating the aeration system is functioning correctly. Analysis confirms the presence of a single, fast-growing microbial contaminant.\n\nGiven these observations, which of the following is the most plausible identity of the contaminant?\n\nA. A wild yeast species that rapidly ferments glucose to ethanol.\n\nB. A strain of *Lactobacillus* that performs homolactic fermentation.\n\nC. A bacteriophage that specifically infects *Saccharopolyspora erythraea*.\n\nD. A fast-growing, non-spore-forming Gram-negative bacterium with strong proteolytic and deaminating activity.\n\nE. An acetic acid bacterium, such as *Acetobacter aceti*.", "solution": "We begin from the observations: the culture is strictly aerobic and normally maintained at pH 7.0, but midway through production the pH begins to rise steadily toward 8.5 while dissolved oxygen remains stable. Erythromycin synthesis falls dramatically, and there is a single, fast-growing microbial contaminant detected. The key diagnostic feature here is the unexpected alkaline drift under aerobic conditions.\n\nAn alkaline drift in a protein-rich medium (peptones and soy meal as primary nitrogen sources) is classically associated with microbial proteolysis followed by oxidative deamination of amino acids, which liberates ammonia. The general stoichiometry of deamination can be written as:\n$$\n\\text{R-CH(NH_{2})-COOH} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{R-CO-COOH} + \\text{NH}_{3}.\n$$\nThe released ammonia undergoes base formation in water:\n$$\n\\text{NH}_{3} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{NH}_{4}^{+} + \\text{OH}^{-},\n$$\nwhich increases $[\\text{OH}^{-}]$ and thereby raises pH. Under aerobic conditions, the corresponding keto acids are further oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, while ammonia remains the principal alkaline species driving the pH upward. Thus, a contaminant with strong proteolytic and deaminating activity, thriving aerobically in a complex medium, best explains the steady rise in pH.\n\nWe now evaluate each option against these constraints.\n\nOption A (wild yeast fermenting glucose to ethanol): In strictly aerobic, well-aerated conditions with stable dissolved oxygen, yeast typically prefers respiration over fermentation. Even if fermentation occurred, the principal products are ethanol and carbon dioxide:\n$$\n\\text{C}_{6}\\text{H}_{12}\\text{O}_{6} \\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{C}_{2}\\text{H}_{5}\\text{OH} + 2\\,\\text{CO}_{2},\n$$\nwhich do not drive alkalinization; yeast contamination more often causes neutral to mildly acidic shifts due to organic acids and does not explain a sustained rise toward pH 8.5.\n\nOption B (homolactic Lactobacillus): Homolactic fermentation produces lactic acid,\n$$\n\\text{C}_{6}\\text{H}_{12}\\text{O}_{6} \\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH(OH)COOH},\n$$\nwhich acidifies the medium, i.e., causes a pH drop, the opposite of the observed rise.\n\nOption C (bacteriophage of Saccharopolyspora): A phage could reduce erythromycin productivity by lysing or inhibiting the producer, but it would not present as a fast-growing microbial contaminant and does not directly cause alkalinization of the medium. The observed stable dissolved oxygen and rising pH specifically implicate metabolic activity of a living contaminant generating basic nitrogen species, which a phage cannot do.\n\nOption E (acetic acid bacterium such as Acetobacter aceti): These oxidize ethanol to acetic acid under aerobic conditions,\n$$\n\\text{C}_{2}\\text{H}_{5}\\text{OH} + \\text{O}_{2} \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_{3}\\text{COOH} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O},\n$$\nacidifying the medium rather than alkalinizing it. This contradicts the observed pH rise.\n\nOption D (fast-growing, non-spore-forming Gram-negative bacterium with strong proteolytic and deaminating activity): Such organisms (e.g., Pseudomonas spp., Proteus-like deaminators) grow rapidly under aerobic conditions, secrete proteases to hydrolyze peptones and soy proteins to amino acids, and perform oxidative deamination, releasing $\\text{NH}_{3}$. The equilibria\n$$\n\\text{NH}_{3} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{NH}_{4}^{+} + \\text{OH}^{-}\n$$\ndrive the pH upwards, explaining the drift toward 8.5 despite control. Additionally, their rapid growth and nutrient scavenging readily depress secondary metabolism (erythromycin synthesis) in the producer strain through competition and alteration of medium composition. Dissolved oxygen remaining stable is consistent with robust aerobic metabolism in a well-aerated system, not with oxygen limitation or fermentative overgrowth.\n\nTherefore, the only option that matches the aerobic conditions, the alkaline pH drift, the medium composition, and the observed reduction in antibiotic production is Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2074099"}]}
