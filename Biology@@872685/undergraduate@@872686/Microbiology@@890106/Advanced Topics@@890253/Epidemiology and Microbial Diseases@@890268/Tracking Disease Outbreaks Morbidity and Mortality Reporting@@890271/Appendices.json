This fundamental epidemiological metric quantifies the proportion of an exposed population that becomes ill, offering a clear, initial assessment of the outbreak's scope. This exercise [@problem_id:2101972] provides a classic scenario to practice calculating this crucial value.", "problem": "A large community potluck was held to celebrate the beginning of summer. A total of 140 people attended the event. Within 48 hours following the potluck, the local public health department received numerous reports of illness. An investigation determined that 49 of the attendees had developed symptoms consistent with acute gastroenteritis. For the purpose of this analysis, all attendees are considered to have been part of the population at risk.\n\nCalculate the overall attack rate for this outbreak. The attack rate in epidemiology measures the proportion of an exposed population that develops a disease. Express your answer as a decimal, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "The attack rate is defined as the proportion of the population at risk that develops the disease. Using the standard epidemiological formula:\n$$\n\\text{Attack rate} = \\frac{\\text{number of new cases}}{\\text{population at risk}}\n$$\nHere, the number of new cases is $49$ and the population at risk is $140$, so:\n$$\n\\text{Attack rate} = \\frac{49}{140}\n$$\nSimplify by dividing numerator and denominator by $7$:\n$$\n\\frac{49}{140} = \\frac{7}{20}\n$$\nConvert to a decimal:\n$$\n\\frac{7}{20} = 0.35\n$$\nRounded to two significant figures, this is $0.35$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.35}$$", "id": "2101972"}, {"introduction": "After an initial wave of infections, epidemiologists must determine how effectively a pathogen spreads from person to person. The secondary attack rate (SAR) is the key metric for this, measuring the risk of infection among susceptible contacts of a primary case.

They monitored 200 households, each with a single identified index case at the start of the observation period. The study population across these 200 households totals 850 individuals.\n\nAn individual is considered susceptible to the virus unless they meet one of two exclusion criteria: (1) documented receipt of the current season's targeted vaccine, or (2) a laboratory-confirmed infection with the same virus strain within the past year. Among the household contacts of the 200 index cases, a total of 155 individuals were vaccinated and an additional 45 had confirmed prior immunity from a recent infection.\n\nOver the follow-up period, new symptomatic cases were recorded among the household contacts. A case is classified as a 'secondary case' if their symptom onset occurred more than 24 hours but no more than 7 days after the symptom onset of their household's index case. Cases with symptom onset within 24 hours of the index case are considered co-primary cases. In total, 132 new symptomatic cases were detected among all household contacts during the study. Of these, 28 were classified as co-primary, and 12 developed symptoms more than 7 days after the index case.\n\nCalculate the secondary attack rate (SAR). The SAR is the proportion of susceptible individuals exposed to an index case who subsequently develop the illness.
