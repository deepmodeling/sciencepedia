This first practice exercise puts you in the role of a public health analyst evaluating a new strain of Avian Influenza. You will calculate a simplified risk metric by integrating key virological factors, such as interspecies transmission potential, receptor binding affinity, and vaccine evasion, into a single score. This problem demonstrates how distinct biological properties can be mathematically combined to create an actionable assessment of zoonotic threat [@problem_id:2099789].", "problem": "In the context of the One Health initiative, which recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, public health agencies are developing quantitative models to assess the pandemic potential of zoonotic pathogens. Consider a scenario involving an outbreak of Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) at a commercial turkey farm where the flock has been vaccinated. A new variant of the virus emerges and is subsequently detected in wild raccoons scavenging near the farm.\n\nTo assess the risk, a simplified metric called the Mammalian Adaptation Potential (MAP) is calculated. The MAP is a dimensionless score defined as the product of three factors:\n\n$MAP = I \\times R \\times V$\n\n1.  **Interspecies Transmission Index ($I$)**: The baseline probability of successful virus transmission during a single close contact event between an infected turkey and a susceptible raccoon. For this specific farm-wildlife interface, this index is determined to be $I = 0.035$.\n\n2.  **Receptor Specificity Shift ($R$)**: A factor quantifying the change in the virus's ability to bind to mammalian host cells. The original AIV strain (baseline) has a binding affinity for mammalian-type receptors ($\\alpha$-2,6-linked sialic acid) that is 4.0% of its affinity for avian-type receptors ($\\alpha$-2,3-linked sialic acid). The new variant, due to mutations in its Hemagglutinin (HA) protein, exhibits a binding affinity for mammalian-type receptors that is 112.0% of its affinity for avian-type receptors. The factor $R$ is defined as the ratio of the variant's affinity ratio (mammalian/avian) to the baseline strain's affinity ratio.\n\n3.  **Vaccine Evasion Factor ($V$)**: A factor measuring the new variant's ability to overcome the immunity provided by the current vaccine in the turkey population. In controlled experiments with vaccinated turkeys, the per-contact transmission probability for the baseline strain is $p_{b} = 0.080$. For the new variant, this probability increases to $p_{v} = 0.52$. The factor $V$ is defined as the ratio of the variant's transmission probability to the baseline's transmission probability ($V = p_{v} / p_{b}$).\n\nCalculate the Mammalian Adaptation Potential (MAP) for this new AIV variant.

You will use genetic distance data to trace a hypervirulent *Clostridioides difficile* outbreak from a potential source in animal feed, through a swine population, to human patients. By applying a Phylogenetic Consistency Index, you will learn how modern genetic sequencing data allows investigators to reconstruct transmission pathways and pinpoint the origin of an outbreak that crosses agricultural and clinical boundaries [@problem_id:2099778].", "problem": "In the context of the One Health initiative, which recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, genomic epidemiology is a critical tool for tracing zoonotic disease outbreaks. An investigation is underway into a concurrent outbreak of a hypervirulent strain of *Clostridioides difficile* affecting human patients in several hospitals and pig populations at regional swine farms. The primary hypothesis is that the pathogen was introduced into the swine population via contaminated animal feed from one of three international suppliers (Supplier A, Supplier B, or Supplier C) and subsequently transmitted to humans.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, shotgun metagenomics was used to reconstruct pathogen gene sequences from the three feed sources, and whole-genome sequencing was performed on isolates from the affected swine (S) and human (H) populations. The average genetic distance, $d(X, Y)$, between any two populations $X$ and $Y$ is quantified by the mean number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) per kilobase across a consistent panel of core virulence genes.\n\nA key assumption of the transmission model $F_i \\to S \\to H$ (where $F_i$ is a feed supplier) is that genetic divergence is additive along the transmission path. The most plausible source is therefore the one whose genetic distances best fit the relationship $d(F_i, H) \\approx d(F_i, S) + d(S, H)$. To quantify this, investigators have defined a Phylogenetic Consistency Index (PCI) for each supplier $F_i$:\n$$PCI(F_i) = \\frac{1000}{1 + (d(F_i, H) - (d(F_i, S) + d(S, H)))^2}$$\nA higher PCI value indicates a more consistent phylogenetic link and a more probable source.\n\nGiven the following genetic distance data, identify the most probable source supplier by calculating its PCI.\n\n| Pair of Populations | Genetic Distance $d(X, Y)$ (SNPs/kb) |\n|:-------------------:|:------------------------------------:|\n| Swine (S) - Human (H) | 12.3                                 |\n| Supplier A - Swine (S)  | 8.1                                  |\n| Supplier B - Swine (S)  | 15.2                                 |\n| Supplier C - Swine (S)  | 6.4                                  |\n| Supplier A - Human (H)  | 20.8                                 |\n| Supplier B - Human (H)  | 29.1                                 |\n| Supplier C - Human (H)  | 25.0                                 |\n\nCalculate the PCI for the most probable source supplier.
