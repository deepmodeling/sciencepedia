This practice explores a classic example involving auxotrophs—strains that have lost the ability to synthesize an essential nutrient. By plating these cells on a medium lacking that nutrient, we create a strong selective pressure that allows us to easily isolate rare 'revertant' mutants that have regained the lost biosynthetic function [@problem_id:2072718].", "problem": "A microbiologist is studying a strain of *Escherichia coli* that is an auxotroph for the amino acid tryptophan, designated as *E. coli* `trp-`. This strain is incapable of synthesizing its own tryptophan and requires it to be present in the growth medium. The researcher aims to isolate rare, spontaneously occurring revertant mutants from the population that have regained the ability to synthesize tryptophan (i.e., have reverted to the prototrophic `trp+` phenotype).\n\nWhich of the following experimental procedures provides the most direct and effective method for selecting and isolating these `trp+` revertants from the large background population of `trp-` cells?\n\nA. Plate a high density of the *E. coli* `trp-` culture onto a minimal medium plate (containing only a basic carbon source and salts) that lacks tryptophan, and incubate to select for colonies that grow.\n\nB.

Plate the *E. coli* `trp-` culture onto a minimal medium plate that is supplemented with a high concentration of an antibiotic, such as penicillin, to which the strain is sensitive. Incubate and select for any colonies that manage to grow.", "solution": "The objective is to isolate rare revertants that have regained tryptophan biosynthesis capacity (the prototrophic `trp+` phenotype) from a large background of `trp-` auxotrophs. The most direct and effective approach is to use positive selection, in which only the desired phenotype can grow under the imposed condition. For tryptophan auxotrophy, growth on minimal medium lacking tryptophan is a direct selection for `trp+` cells because only cells capable of synthesizing tryptophan will grow; `trp-` cells cannot synthesize tryptophan and thus will not form colonies.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A plates a high density of the *E. coli* `trp-` culture onto minimal medium lacking tryptophan. This is positive selection for `trp+` revertants: only revertants that have regained tryptophan biosynthesis will divide and form colonies, making them easy to isolate directly from the plate. This is the standard, most direct method.\n- Option B uses replica plating from complete medium to minimal medium lacking tryptophan, then proposes isolating colonies from the original complete plate that failed to grow on minimal. That procedure identifies and isolates `trp-` colonies, not `trp+` revertants. Moreover, replica plating is a screening method rather than a selection, and even if adapted to pick the colonies that do grow on minimal, it is less direct than plating directly on minimal to select `trp+`.\n- Option C offers no selective pressure on complete medium; `trp+` revertants do not have a reliable competitive advantage or a consistent colony size difference on complete medium, so this does not effectively isolate `trp+` cells.\n- Option D misapplies antibiotic selection. Penicillin-type antibiotics preferentially kill dividing cells; in minimal medium lacking tryptophan, `trp+` cells would divide and be killed, while `trp-` cells would not divide and thus be spared. This enriches for auxotrophs, not revertants, and does not select `trp+`.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and effective procedure is to plate on minimal medium lacking tryptophan to positively select for `trp+` revertants, as described in Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2072718"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to selection, screening involves visually inspecting all individuals in a population to find those with the desired phenotype. This approach is essential when a mutation does not confer a unique survival advantage, such as the loss of an enzymatic function. This exercise demonstrates a common screening method using an indicator dye to identify bacterial mutants that can no longer break down starch, providing a clear visual cue to distinguish them from the wild-type population [@problem_id:2072731].", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating the function of the enzyme alpha-amylase in the bacterium *Bacillus subtilis*. Alpha-amylase is an extracellular enzyme that hydrolyzes starch into smaller sugar molecules. To find strains that have lost the ability to produce this enzyme, the researcher first exposes a culture of wild-type *B. subtilis* to a mutagenic agent. Subsequently, the treated bacterial population is spread onto a solid agar plate where the growth medium contains starch as well as other essential nutrients.\n\nAfter incubation for 24 hours, distinct bacterial colonies are visible. The researcher then floods the surface of the plate with an iodine solution. Two different visual outcomes, referred to as Phenotype 1 and Phenotype 2, are observed among the colonies:\n\n- **Phenotype 1:** Colonies that are each surrounded by a distinct, clear, colorless halo against a dark purplish-blue background agar.\n- **Phenotype 2:** Colonies where the dark purplish-blue color of the agar extends directly to the edge of the colony, with no clear halo present.\n\nThe researcher's goal is to isolate the amylase-deficient mutants. Which of the following statements correctly identifies the mutant phenotype and the underlying principle of this screening method?\n\nA. Phenotype 1 represents the amylase-deficient mutants. The clear halo is a zone where the cells have lysed due to their inability to metabolize the starch, releasing cellular contents that repel the iodine.\n\nB. Phenotype 2 represents the amylase-deficient mutants. These mutants secrete a modified protein that binds iodine more strongly than starch, creating a dark appearance immediately adjacent to the colony.\n\nC. Phenotype 2 represents the amylase-deficient mutants. Iodine stains the starch in the agar a dark color; the absence of a clear halo indicates that the starch surrounding the colony was not hydrolyzed because the cells failed to secrete active amylase.\n\nD. Phenotype 1 represents the amylase-deficient mutants. The wild-type cells consume the starch so efficiently that it is depleted locally, preventing the dark staining reaction with iodine that is seen around the mutant colonies.\n\nE. Phenotype 2 represents the amylase-deficient mutants. This procedure is a positive selection, as the iodine solution is toxic to the wild-type cells, leaving only the living mutant colonies for isolation.", "solution": "Alpha-amylase is an extracellular enzyme that hydrolyzes starch into smaller sugars. Iodine forms a dark purplish-blue complex with intact starch but does not stain areas where starch has been hydrolyzed.\n\nWhen colonies secrete active alpha-amylase, they digest the starch in the agar surrounding the colony during incubation. Upon flooding with iodine, the region lacking intact starch does not form the dark complex and appears as a clear, colorless halo around the colony. Therefore, a clear halo indicates amylase activity (wild type).\n\nConversely, if a colony fails to secrete active alpha-amylase (amylase-deficient mutant), the starch in the agar remains intact up to the colony edge. After iodine is added, the agar stains dark right up to the colony margin with no clear halo. Therefore, absence of a clear halo indicates loss of amylase activity.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: the clear halo reflects starch hydrolysis, not cell lysis or iodine repulsion.\n- B is incorrect: iodine complexes with intact starch, not with a modified secreted protein.\n- C is correct: Phenotype 2 (no halo) indicates retained starch due to lack of amylase secretion; thus these are the mutants, and the principle is iodine staining of intact starch.\n- D is incorrect: it misidentifies the mutant; wild-type produces the clear halo.\n- E is incorrect: this is a screen, not a positive selection; iodine is an indicator, not a toxic agent in this context.\n\nTherefore, Phenotype 2 represents the amylase-deficient mutants, based on iodine staining of intact starch, and the method is a screening assay for loss of extracellular enzyme activity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2072731"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply identifying mutants, it is often crucial to determine the frequency at which they arise spontaneously in a population.
