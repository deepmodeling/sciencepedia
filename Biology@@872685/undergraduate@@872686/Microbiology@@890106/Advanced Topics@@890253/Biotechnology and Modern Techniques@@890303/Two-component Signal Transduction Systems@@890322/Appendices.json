A canonical TCST system consists of a membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase and a cytoplasmic response regulator.\n\nConsider a hypothetical bacterium, *Bacillus exemplaris*, which utilizes a TCST system to manage phosphate acquisition. This system is composed of the sensor kinase `Phos` and the response regulator `PhoR`. Under conditions of low environmental phosphate, the `Phos` protein autophosphorylates and subsequently transfers the phosphate group to `PhoR`. The resulting phosphorylated `PhoR` then acts as a transcriptional activator, binding to specific DNA sequences to induce the expression of a set of genes required for high-affinity phosphate scavenging. In contrast, under high phosphate conditions, `Phos` is inactive, `PhoR` remains unphosphorylated, and the scavenging genes are not expressed.\n\nA microbiologist creates a mutant strain of *B. exemplaris* in which the gene encoding the sensor kinase, `phos`, has been completely deleted from the chromosome. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected phenotype of this `phos` deletion mutant when compared to the wild-type strain?\n\nA. The phosphate-scavenging genes will be constitutively expressed at a high level, regardless of the external phosphate concentration, leading to wasteful energy expenditure in high-phosphate environments.\n\nB. The mutant will grow normally in high-phosphate medium but will fail to induce the expression of phosphate-scavenging genes in low-phosphate medium, leading to severe growth impairment or cessation under phosphate-limiting conditions.\n\nC. The mutant will exhibit a phenotype identical to the wild-type strain, as the response regulator `PhoR` will be able to sense phosphate levels directly.\n\nD. The mutant will grow normally in low-phosphate medium but will experience toxicity and growth arrest in high-phosphate medium due to the misregulation of phosphate homeostasis.", "solution": "In a canonical two-component system, the sensor histidine kinase (denote it $S$) autophosphorylates under the appropriate input signal and transfers the phosphoryl group to the response regulator (denote it $R$). Symbolically, under low phosphate conditions the reactions are:\n$$\nS + \\mathrm{ATP} \\rightarrow S_{\\mathrm{P}} + \\mathrm{ADP}, \\quad S_{\\mathrm{P}} + R \\rightarrow S + R_{\\mathrm{P}}.\n$$\nThe phosphorylated response regulator $R_{\\mathrm{P}}$ acts as a transcriptional activator for the phosphate-scavenging genes. Let $E$ denote the expression level of these genes. Then $E$ is an increasing function of $[R_{\\mathrm{P}}]$, which we can denote as $E = f([R_{\\mathrm{P}}])$ with $f'(x) > 0$.\n\nAt the level of reaction kinetics, production and loss of $R_{\\mathrm{P}}$ can be summarized as:\n$$\n\\frac{d[R_{\\mathrm{P}}]}{dt} = k_{t}[S_{\\mathrm{P}}][R] - k_{d}[R_{\\mathrm{P}}],\n$$\nwhere $k_{t}$ is the phosphotransfer rate constant and $k_{d}$ is the effective dephosphorylation rate constant (including any intrinsic autodephosphorylation or phosphatase activity). At steady state,\n$$\n[R_{\\mathrm{P}}]_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_{t}}{k_{d}}[S_{\\mathrm{P}}][R].\n$$\nThus, in the wild type under low phosphate, $[S_{\\mathrm{P}}] > 0$ yields $[R_{\\mathrm{P}}]_{\\mathrm{ss}} > 0$ and therefore $E$ is high; under high phosphate, the problem states that $S$ is inactive, so $[S_{\\mathrm{P}}] = 0$ and hence $[R_{\\mathrm{P}}]_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 0$, giving low $E$.\n\nIn the phos deletion mutant, the sensor kinase is absent: $[S] = 0$ implies $[S_{\\mathrm{P}}] = 0$ in all environments. Substituting into the steady-state expression gives\n$$\n[R_{\\mathrm{P}}]_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad E = f(0) \\text{ (basal/low) }\n$$\nindependent of external phosphate. Therefore, the phosphate-scavenging regulon cannot be induced in low phosphate, but the mutant behaves like wild type in high phosphate where the scavenging system is not required.\n\nConsequences for growth follow directly from the regulatory logic. In high-phosphate medium, cells do not require the high-affinity scavenging genes, so the mutant grows normally. In low-phosphate medium, failure to induce these genes prevents efficient phosphate acquisition, leading to severe growth impairment or cessation. This matches option B and contradicts the alternatives: A would require constitutive $R_{\\mathrm{P}}$ without the kinase, C incorrectly assumes the response regulator senses phosphate directly, and D reverses the expected growth pattern.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2102908"}, {"introduction": "Signal transduction is more than a simple chemical relay; it relies on precise molecular interactions.

This (XylR-P)₂ dimer is the sole species capable of binding to a specific operator sequence in the promoter of the *xylE* gene.\n5.  Binding of the (XylR-P)₂ dimer to the operator acts as a transcriptional activator, leading to a high level of *xylE* transcription.

Consequently, XylR* is completely unable to form a dimer, irrespective of its phosphorylation state.

No additions to the minimal medium (control).", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the experimental outcome of a reporter gene assay designed to identify the environmental signal for a specific Two-Component Signal transduction System (TCS). The solution requires understanding the mechanism of a TCS and how a reporter gene like Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) can be used to measure gene expression.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Two-Component Signal Transduction System (TCS)**\n\nA TCS is a common mechanism used by bacteria to sense and respond to changes in their environment. It consists of two main proteins:\n1.  A **sensor histidine kinase** (here, `MetS`), which is typically a transmembrane protein. It senses a specific extracellular signal.\n2.  A **response regulator** (here, `MetR`), which is a cytoplasmic protein. It mediates the cellular response, usually by acting as a transcription factor.\n\nThe signaling cascade proceeds as follows:\n- Upon binding its specific signal, the sensor kinase `MetS` autophosphorylates on a conserved histidine residue, using ATP as a phosphate donor. This forms the activated `MetS-P`.\n- The activated sensor kinase `MetS-P` then transfers the phosphate group to a conserved aspartate residue on the response regulator `MetR`. This creates the activated response regulator, `MetR-P`.\n- The activated response regulator `MetR-P` then binds to a specific DNA sequence in the promoter region of its target gene(s) (in this case, promoter `P_M`) and alters their transcription.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Reporter Gene Construct**\n\nThe researcher has created a reporter system by fusing the promoter of interest (`P_M`) to the gene for GFP (`gfp`). This means that the expression of GFP is now under the control of the `P_M` promoter.\n- If the `P_M` promoter is activated, the `gfp` gene will be transcribed into mRNA and then translated into GFP.\n- The amount of GFP produced is directly proportional to the activity of the `P_M` promoter.\n- GFP is a fluorescent protein, so the activity of the promoter can be easily quantified by measuring the intensity of green fluorescence from the bacterial culture.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the TCS to the Reporter System**\n\nThe complete pathway in the engineered bacterium is:\nEnvironmental Signal → `MetS` activation → `MetS-P` → `MetR` phosphorylation → `MetR-P` → `MetR-P` binds to `P_M` → `gfp` gene is transcribed → GFP is produced → Culture fluoresces green.\n\nThe question states we should assume that the *specific* signal for the `MetS/MetR` system is the mercury ion, Hg²⁺. Therefore, only the presence of Hg²⁺ should trigger this entire cascade.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Experimental Conditions**\n\nWe must now evaluate each condition based on the assumption that Hg²⁺ is the specific activating signal.\n\n- **A. Addition of sodium chloride (NaCl):** This induces osmotic stress. Bacteria have specific TCSs to respond to osmotic stress (e.g., EnvZ/OmpR in *E. coli*), but this is a different signal from heavy metal toxicity. Therefore, NaCl is not expected to activate the `MetS/MetR` system. Fluorescence should be at a low, basal level.\n\n- **B. Addition of mercury(II) chloride (HgCl₂):** This compound provides mercury ions (Hg²⁺) in the medium. According to the problem's core assumption, Hg²⁺ is the specific signal that `MetS` detects. Its presence will trigger the full phosphorylation cascade, leading to the formation of `MetR-P`. `MetR-P` will then bind to the `P_M` promoter, strongly activating the transcription of the `gfp` gene. This will result in a high level of GFP production and thus the highest measured green fluorescence.\n\n- **C. Addition of glucose:** Glucose is a primary carbon source. Bacteria metabolize glucose and use it for growth. Signaling related to glucose availability is typically handled by systems like catabolite repression, not by a TCS dedicated to heavy metal stress. Glucose will not activate the `MetS/MetR` system. Fluorescence should be at a low, basal level.\n\n- **D. Addition of zinc sulfate (ZnSO₄):** Zinc (Zn²⁺) is another heavy metal ion. While chemically similar to mercury, the problem specifies that the `MetS/MetR` system is *specific* for mercury. In an idealized system, the sensor kinase has high specificity for its ligand. Therefore, zinc is not expected to bind to `MetS` or cause significant activation. Fluorescence should remain at a low, basal level.\n\n- **E. No additions (control):** This flask contains only the minimal medium. In the absence of the specific inducing signal (Hg²⁺), the `MetS/MetR` system will be inactive. There might be a very low, basal level of \"leaky\" transcription from the `P_M` promoter, but this will serve as the baseline against which other conditions are compared. It will not show high fluorescence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the logic above, only the addition of mercury(II) chloride will specifically activate the `MetS/MetR` TCS, leading to strong activation of the `P_M` promoter and high-level expression of the GFP reporter. This will result in the highest measured fluorescence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2102928"}]}
