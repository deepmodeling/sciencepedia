The number of naturally occurring cases is known to be highly dependent on climatic factors that influence the aerosolization of fungal arthroconidia from the soil.\n\nYour agency uses an empirical model to predict the expected number of cases, $\\lambda$, in a given month. This model is given by:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{P}{10^5} \\times I_0 \\times C_f $$\nwhere $P$ is the population of the region, $I_0$ is the historical baseline monthly incidence rate per 100,000 people, and $C_f$ is the Climatic Amplification Factor.

This practice demonstrates how modern genomics provides powerful clues for linking cases and identifying sources.

Cases have been reported in three geographically separate districts: Northwood, Southville, and Eastgate. Public health officials suspect a bioterrorism event and have managed to isolate and sequence the full genomes of the bacterial strains from several patients.\n\nThe intelligence agency believes the perpetrators used a specific weaponized strain, designated `YP-REF`, as the source material. A comparative genomic analysis was performed on five patient isolates, focusing on Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that distinguish the isolates from the `YP-REF` strain. The results are as follows:\n\n1.  Two isolates from Northwood, `YP-N1` and `YP-N2`, are genetically identical to each other. They each possess a set of two unique SNPs, designated as `Set N = {SNP-1, SNP-2}`, which are not present in `YP-REF`.\n2.  One isolate from Southville, `YP-S1`, possesses a set of three unique SNPs, designated as `Set S = {SNP-3, SNP-4, SNP-5}`. These are not present in `YP-REF`, and they are entirely different from the SNPs in `Set N`.\n3.  Two isolates from Eastgate, `YP-E1` and `YP-E2`, are genetically identical to each other. They show no SNP differences when compared to the `YP-REF` strain.\n\nIt is known from previous studies that the spontaneous mutation rate of *Yersinia pestis* is very low, making it highly improbable for multiple SNPs to arise and become fixed in different lineages during the short timescale of a single person-to-person transmission chain.\n\nBased on this genomic data, which of the following scenarios is the most plausible explanation for the outbreak?\n\nA. The data support a single-point release in Northwood, with subsequent person-to-person spread to Southville and Eastgate.\n\nB. The data support a single-point release in Eastgate, with subsequent person-to-person spread to Northwood and Southville.\n\nC. The data support three independent, coordinated release events in Northwood, Southville, and Eastgate.\n\nD. The data are insufficient to distinguish between a single-point release and multiple release events.\n\nE. The data support two release events: one in Eastgate and a second in Southville, from which the pathogen spread to Northwood.", "solution": "Define the reference genotype by its set of SNP differences from the source strain as follows. Let $D(X)$ denote the set of SNPs present in isolate $X$ that distinguish it from $YP\\text{-}REF$.

Formally, interpreting transmission events as branches in a phylogeny and SNP changes as edges, parsimony favors explanations that minimize the number of SNP acquisitions or reversions.\n\nEvaluate each scenario by the minimal number and type of SNP changes required.\n\nA. Single-point release in Northwood implies the initial released genotype has $D=\\{\\text{SNP-1},\\text{SNP-2}\\}=N$. To obtain Eastgate with $D=\\emptyset$, at least $|N|=2$ reversions are required. To obtain Southville with $D=S$, at least $|N|=2$ reversions plus $|S|=3$ new SNP acquisitions are required, for a minimum of $2+3=5$ changes in that lineage. Given the low mutation rate and the improbability of multiple SNP gains and reversions over short timescales, this scenario is implausible.\n\nB. Single-point release in Eastgate implies the initial released genotype has $D=\\emptyset$. To obtain Northwood with $D=N$, at least $|N|=2$ SNP acquisitions are required. To obtain Southville with $D=S$, at least $|S|=3$ SNP acquisitions are required. This requires independent accumulation and fixation of multiple SNPs in separate lineages within the outbreak window, which is highly improbable under the stated low mutation rate.\n\nC. Three independent, coordinated releases allow assigning one release with $D=\\emptyset$ in Eastgate, one with $D=N$ in Northwood, and one with $D=S$ in Southville. This exactly matches the observed $D$ sets in each district without invoking any SNP acquisitions or reversions during transmission. By parsimony and the low mutation rate, this is the most plausible scenario.\n\nD. Insufficient data would apply if multiple scenarios required comparable and plausible mutational steps. Here, single-point releases necessitate multiple SNP events (including reversions) that are explicitly stated to be highly improbable, whereas coordinated releases require zero mutational steps to explain the observed patterns. Thus, the data are sufficient to discriminate.\n\nE. Two releases, one in Eastgate with $D=\\emptyset$ and one in Southville with $D=S$, with spread to Northwood would require generating Northwood’s $D=N$ from either $D=\\emptyset$ (requiring at least $|N|=2$ SNP acquisitions) or from $D=S$ (requiring at least $|S|=3$ reversions plus $|N|=2$ acquisitions). Both possibilities invoke multiple unlikely SNP events under the low mutation rate and short timescale, making this scenario implausible.\n\nBy minimizing required mutational events and using the stated low mutation rate, the most parsimonious and plausible explanation is three independent, coordinated releases matching the three observed genotypes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2057054"}, {"introduction": "Responding to a confirmed bioterrorism event often involves mass screening and prophylaxis, but these interventions have significant logistical and clinical consequences.
