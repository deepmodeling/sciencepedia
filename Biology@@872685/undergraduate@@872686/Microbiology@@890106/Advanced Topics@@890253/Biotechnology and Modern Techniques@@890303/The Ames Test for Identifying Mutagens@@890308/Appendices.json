The test utilizes a specialized strain of *Salmonella typhimurium* that is a histidine auxotroph, meaning it cannot synthesize its own histidine and requires it in the growth medium.\n\nTwo sets of plates are prepared with a minimal glucose medium lacking histidine.\n-   The **control plate** is inoculated with the *Salmonella typhimurium* strain.\n-   The **test plate** is inoculated with the *Salmonella typhimurium* strain, a small amount of Solvent Z, and a rat liver extract (S9 mix) which contains metabolic enzymes.\n\nAfter incubation, the number of visible colonies on each plate is counted.

Thus:\n- Only revertants ($his^{+}$) form visible colonies on minimal medium without histidine.\n- The control plate measures spontaneous reversion, giving a baseline colony number.\n- The test plate includes the compound under evaluation and often an S9 mix to allow metabolic activation; an increase in revertant colonies indicates mutagenicity of the compound or its metabolites.\n\nDefine the observed colony counts:\n$$N_{c} = 28 \\quad \\text{(control, spontaneous revertants)}$$\n$$N_{t} = 217 \\quad \\text{(test with Solvent Z + S9)}$$\nMutagenicity is inferred when $N_{t} > N_{c}$ by a substantial margin.

This practice explores this critical concept by challenging you to predict the outcome when the metabolic activation system (the S9 mix) is omitted from the test. Understanding this scenario is key to appreciating why the S9 mix is a standard and essential component of modern toxicology screening [@problem_id:2096128].", "problem": "A microbiologist is investigating the potential mutagenicity of Chemical X using the Ames test. The Ames test utilizes a special strain of *Salmonella typhimurium* that is a histidine auxotroph, meaning it carries a mutation rendering it unable to synthesize the amino acid histidine ($his^-$). These bacteria are plated on a minimal medium that completely lacks histidine. Only bacteria that undergo a reverse mutation (reversion) to a prototrophic state ($his^+$) can grow and form colonies.\n\nIt is known from previous studies that Chemical X is a potent pro-mutagen. A pro-mutagen is a substance that is not mutagenic in its native form but requires metabolic activation by enzymes to be converted into its active, mutagenic form. In a standard Ames test, this metabolic activation is simulated by adding an S9 extract, which is a preparation of liver enzymes from rats.\n\nIn this particular experiment, the microbiologist plates the $his^-$ *Salmonella* strain on the histidine-deficient medium and adds Chemical X. However, a crucial procedural error is made: the S9 extract is omitted from the experimental plate. Which of the following outcomes is the most likely to be observed on this plate, when compared to a negative control plate containing only the bacteria and no added chemicals?\n\nA. A very large number of revertant colonies will form, far exceeding the number on the negative control plate.\n\nB. The number of revertant colonies will be approximately the same as the spontaneous reversion rate observed on the negative control plate.\n\nC. No bacterial colonies will grow whatsoever, not even spontaneous revertants, due to the toxicity of Chemical X.\n\nD. A continuous lawn of bacterial growth will cover the entire surface of the plate.\n\nE. The bacteria will form colonies, but they will all be unusually small and pigmented.", "solution": "The Ames test uses a $his^-$ strain of Salmonella typhimurium plated on histidine-free minimal medium, so only bacteria that have reverted to $his^+$ can grow into colonies. Thus, the observed colonies represent reverse mutations to prototrophy.\n\nChemical X is described as a pro-mutagen, meaning it requires metabolic activation by liver enzymes to become mutagenic. In the standard Ames test, this activation is provided by the S9 fraction. If the S9 extract is omitted, Chemical X remains in its native, non-activated form and therefore is not expected to increase the mutation rate above the spontaneous background.\n\nLogical implications:\n1. Without S9, a pro-mutagen will not be converted to its active mutagenic form.\n2. Therefore, the mutation rate induced by Chemical X will not exceed spontaneous reversion.\n3. On histidine-free medium, $his^-$ cells cannot form a lawn; only $his^+$ revertants form colonies.\n4. In the absence of activation, Chemical X is unlikely to exert specific toxicity that would eliminate all growth, especially of spontaneous revertants; hence colonies should still appear at the background rate.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is unlikely because activation is absent, so no large increase in revertants is expected.\n- B matches the expectation that only spontaneous revertants will appear, similar to the negative control.\n- C requires non-specific toxicity sufficient to prevent even spontaneous revertants; this is not implied and is not the most likely outcome for a pro-mutagen lacking activation.\n- D is impossible because the his- strain cannot grow as a lawn on histidine-free medium.\n- E describes altered colony morphology unrelated to the mechanism of mutagenesis or the conditions described and is not expected.\n\nTherefore, the most likely observation is that the number of revertant colonies is approximately the same as the spontaneous reversion rate on the negative control plate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2096128"}, {"introduction": "Accurate interpretation of an Ames test requires distinguishing between a chemical's ability to cause mutations and its ability to kill the bacteria outright. This exercise presents a common real-world scenario where a chemical is highly toxic, creating a \"zone of inhibition\" on the plate. Working through this problem will help you learn to differentiate between a toxic effect and a mutagenic one, a crucial skill for avoiding misinterpretation of test results [@problem_id:2096083].", "problem": "A microbiology student is conducting an Ames test to evaluate the mutagenic potential of a newly synthesized chemical, \"Compound Z\". The student uses a special strain of *Salmonella typhimurium* that is an auxotroph for the amino acid histidine ($his^-$), meaning it cannot produce its own histidine and requires an external source to grow.\n\nThe experimental procedure involves the following steps:\n1. A culture of the $his^-$ *Salmonella typhimurium* is mixed with a small amount of rat liver extract. This extract contains metabolic enzymes that can convert some non-mutagenic compounds into active mutagens, mimicking metabolic processes in mammals.\n2. The mixture is then spread evenly onto the surface of a minimal glucose-salts agar plate. The agar medium is designed to be deficient in histidine, but it contains a trace amount, just enough to support a few rounds of cell division.\n3. A sterile paper disk saturated with a concentrated solution of Compound Z is placed in the center of the agar plate.\n4. The plate is incubated for 48 hours at 37°C.\n\nAfter incubation, the student observes a distinct, bacteria-free \"zone of inhibition\" immediately surrounding the disk where Compound Z was applied. Beyond this clear zone, a sparse background lawn of bacterial growth is visible across the rest of the plate.\n\nBased on this specific observation of a clear zone of inhibition, what is the most accurate conclusion that can be drawn about Compound Z at the concentration tested?\n\nA. Compound Z is a potent mutagen.\n\nB. Compound Z is toxic or antimicrobial to the *Salmonella* strain.\n\nC. The $his^-$ strain of *Salmonella* spontaneously reverted to a $his^+$ phenotype in the presence of the compound.\n\nD. The rat liver extract successfully metabolized Compound Z into a non-toxic, non-mutagenic substance.\n\nE. The trace amount of histidine in the medium was insufficient to support any bacterial growth near the disk.", "solution": "Goal: Determine what the observation of a clear zone of inhibition around the disk implies about Compound Z at the concentration tested in an Ames test setup.\n\nPrinciple of the Ames test:\n- The test uses a $his^-$ auxotrophic strain that cannot grow on minimal medium once the trace histidine is exhausted. The plate contains a trace amount of histidine sufficient for a few cell divisions to allow potential mutations to occur.\n- A mutagen increases the frequency of reversion to $his^+$, enabling revertant colonies to grow after the trace histidine is depleted. The diagnostic readout for mutagenicity is an increased number of $his^+$ revertant colonies, often concentrated in regions where the mutagen concentration is high enough to induce mutations but not high enough to be lethal.\n\nDisk diffusion and concentration gradient:\n- When a chemical is placed on a disk, it diffuses radially into the agar, creating a concentration profile $c(r)$ that decreases with distance $r$ from the disk.\n- If the chemical is toxic (antimicrobial) to the test strain, there exists a radius $r_0$ such that for $0 \\leq r  r_0$, $c(r) > \\text{MIC}$ (minimum inhibitory concentration), causing no growth; for $r > r_0$, $c(r)  \\text{MIC}$, allowing growth. This produces a clear “zone of inhibition” around the disk.\n\nInterpretation of the observed pattern:\n- The observation is a distinct, bacteria-free zone immediately around the disk and a sparse background lawn beyond it. This is the classic signature of toxicity/antimicrobial activity at or above the MIC near the disk: $c(r) > \\text{MIC}$ yields inhibition close to the disk, and $c(r)  \\text{MIC}$ yields growth farther away.\n- In contrast, evidence of mutagenicity would be an elevated number of $his^+$ revertant colonies, not a cleared zone. Often, mutagens produce a ring of revertant colonies at distances where $c(r)$ is mutagenic but not lethal. A clear zone indicates that in the high-concentration region, cells cannot survive to yield any colonies, including revertants.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A. Compound Z is a potent mutagen. This is not supported by a clear zone; mutagenicity would present as increased revertant colonies, not growth inhibition.\n- B. Compound Z is toxic or antimicrobial to the Salmonella strain. This directly matches the zone of inhibition and the disk diffusion logic $c(r) > \\text{MIC}$ near the disk.\n- C. The $his^-$ strain spontaneously reverted to $his^+$ in the presence of the compound. Spontaneous reversion occurs at low frequency and would not cause a clear inhibition zone; moreover, the noted feature is absence of growth, not increased revertants.\n- D. The rat liver extract metabolized Compound Z into a non-toxic, non-mutagenic substance. The observed inhibition contradicts “non-toxic”; one cannot conclude non-mutagenicity or non-toxicity from a clear zone.\n- E. The trace histidine was insufficient to support growth near the disk. The histidine concentration in the agar is uniform; the spatially restricted absence of growth is due to the compound’s concentration gradient, not localized histidine depletion.\n\nConclusion: The most accurate conclusion consistent with the described observation is that Compound Z is toxic or antimicrobial to the Salmonella strain at the tested concentration near the disk.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2096083"}]}
