{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A foundational skill in molecular biology is the ability to predict the outcome of a restriction digest. This process, often called restriction mapping, is like creating a blueprint of a DNA molecule. By understanding the locations of specific enzyme cut sites on a plasmid, we can anticipate the sizes of the DNA fragments that will be produced, which is essential for verifying plasmid identity and planning cloning strategies. This exercise challenges you to apply these principles to a double-digest scenario, a common technique used in the lab, and translate a circular DNA map into a pattern of fragments you would expect to see on an agarose gel [@problem_id:2090718].", "problem": "A molecular biologist is working with a newly isolated circular plasmid from a bacterial species. Through sequencing, the plasmid is determined to have a total size of 8.0 kilobases (kb). Further analysis of the sequence reveals that it contains exactly two recognition sites for the restriction enzyme BamHI and a single recognition site for the restriction enzyme EcoRI. The map of the plasmid is as follows:\n\n- The EcoRI site is designated as the 0 kb reference point.\n- The first BamHI site is located at the 2.5 kb position.\n- The second BamHI site is located at the 6.0 kb position.\n\nThe biologist performs a complete simultaneous digestion of the plasmid with both BamHI and EcoRI. The resulting DNA fragments are then separated by size using agarose gel electrophoresis. Assuming the digestion reaction goes to completion, which of the following options correctly describes the sizes of the DNA fragments that would be observed as distinct bands on the gel?\n\nA. A single band at 8.0 kb.\n\nB. Two bands, at 3.5 kb and 4.5 kb.\n\nC. Three bands, at 2.0 kb, 2.5 kb, and 3.5 kb.\n\nD. Three bands, at 1.5 kb, 2.5 kb, and 4.0 kb.\n\nE. Four bands, at 2.0 kb, 2.5 kb, 3.5 kb and 6.0 kb.", "solution": "Let the circular plasmid have total length $L=8.0$ kb. Let the cut sites be mapped on a circular coordinate with positions (in kb) $s_{\\mathrm{EcoRI}}=0$, $s_{\\mathrm{BamHI1}}=2.5$, and $s_{\\mathrm{BamHI2}}=6.0$. A complete digestion at all sites on a circular molecule produces a number of fragments equal to the number of cuts, and the fragment lengths are the arc lengths between consecutive cut sites when traversing the circle once.\n\nOrdering the sites along increasing coordinate and wrapping around the circle, the three fragment lengths are given by successive differences:\n$$\nd_{1}=s_{\\mathrm{BamHI1}}-s_{\\mathrm{EcoRI}}=2.5-0=2.5\\ \\text{kb},\n$$\n$$\nd_{2}=s_{\\mathrm{BamHI2}}-s_{\\mathrm{BamHI1}}=6.0-2.5=3.5\\ \\text{kb},\n$$\n$$\nd_{3}=(s_{\\mathrm{EcoRI}}+L)-s_{\\mathrm{BamHI2}}=(0+8.0)-6.0=2.0\\ \\text{kb}.\n$$\nThus, three fragments of sizes $2.0$ kb, $2.5$ kb, and $3.5$ kb will be observed. This corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2090718"}, {"introduction": "Once DNA fragments are generated, the next step in creating a recombinant molecule is to join them together using DNA ligase. However, this enzymatic reaction is not a simple matter of mixing any two pieces of DNA. This problem explores the critical concept of cohesive end compatibility, which dictates whether ligation can occur. Understanding why specific pairs of restriction enzyme-generated \"sticky ends\" can or cannot be joined is fundamental to designing a successful cloning experiment and avoiding failed reactions [@problem_id:2090683].", "problem": "A student in a molecular biology laboratory is tasked with creating a recombinant plasmid. The goal is to insert a specific gene, isolated from a different source, into a circular plasmid vector. The student successfully isolates the gene of interest as a linear fragment of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The ends of this gene insert are generated by digesting it with the restriction enzyme EcoRI. The student also prepares the circular plasmid vector by digesting it with a different restriction enzyme, HindIII, which cuts the plasmid at a single site, converting it into a linear molecule.\n\nThe recognition sequences and cleavage patterns (indicated by `↓`) for these enzymes are as follows:\n- **EcoRI**: 5'-G↓AATTC-3'\n- **HindIII**: 5'-A↓AGCTT-3'\n\nAfter preparing the EcoRI-digested insert and the HindIII-digested vector, the student mixes them together in a tube with DNA ligase and the appropriate buffer. The student incubates the reaction mixture, expecting the DNA ligase to covalently join the insert into the vector backbone.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the primary outcome of this ligation reaction?\n\nA. The ligation will be highly efficient, resulting in a large population of circular recombinant plasmids containing the gene insert.\n\nB. The ligation will fail to produce the desired recombinant plasmid because the cohesive ends generated by the two different restriction enzymes are not complementary.\n\nC. The ligation will be successful, but the gene insert will be incorporated in a random orientation because both enzymes create 5' overhangs.\n\nD. The DNA ligase will join the insert to the vector at only one end, resulting in a linear DNA molecule composed of the vector attached to the insert.", "solution": "DNA ligase efficiently joins DNA fragments with cohesive (sticky) ends only when those ends are complementary and can transiently anneal via Watson-Crick base pairing to align the phosphodiester backbone for ligation. Therefore, to predict the ligation outcome, determine the overhangs generated by each enzyme and assess complementarity.\n\nEcoRI recognizes 5'-GAATTC-3' and cleaves between G and A, generating a 5' overhang with the sequence AATT on each end of the EcoRI-digested insert. HindIII recognizes 5'-AAGCTT-3' and cleaves between the first A and the second A, generating a 5' overhang with the sequence AGCT on each end of the HindIII-digested vector. For ligation between the insert and the vector, the EcoRI-generated AATT overhang must be complementary to the HindIII-generated AGCT overhang. However, AATT is complementary to TTAA, and AGCT is complementary to TCGA; thus, AATT and AGCT are not complementary to each other. Without base pairing between the overhangs, DNA ligase cannot productively join the insert to the vector.\n\nAs a result, the primary outcome is failure to produce the desired recombinant plasmid. Instead, side reactions such as vector self-ligation (HindIII ends ligating to each other) and insert self-ligation/concatemerization (EcoRI ends ligating to each other) may occur, but these do not yield the intended EcoRI-insert in a HindIII-cut vector. Therefore, the most accurate prediction is that the ligation will not produce the desired recombinant due to incompatible cohesive ends.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2090683"}, {"introduction": "This practice problem integrates the concepts of digestion and ligation into a complete, albeit flawed, experimental workflow. It simulates a real-world cloning scenario, including the crucial screening step that allows researchers to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful outcomes. By analyzing the consequences of a common procedural omission—forgetting to treat the vector with alkaline phosphatase—you will learn to troubleshoot experiments and understand why certain background products, like self-ligated vectors, can dominate a reaction. This exercise is key to developing the critical thinking needed to interpret complex experimental results [@problem_id:2090679].", "problem": "A researcher is attempting to clone a specific gene that codes for a thermostable enzyme into a plasmid vector for expression in *Escherichia coli*. The plasmid vector, pVector, is 4.5 kilobases (kb) in size and contains a single recognition site for the restriction enzyme HindIII located within a lacZα gene region. The plasmid also carries a gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin. The gene of interest is 1.5 kb long and has been amplified via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) such that it is flanked by HindIII recognition sites.\n\nThe experimental procedure is as follows:\n1.  Both the pVector plasmid and the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragment containing the gene of interest are independently digested with the HindIII restriction enzyme.\n2.  The digested pVector and the digested gene fragment are then mixed together with DNA ligase to facilitate the insertion of the gene into the plasmid.\n3.  Critically, the researcher forgets to perform a standard step: treating the HindIII-digested pVector with alkaline phosphatase before the ligation reaction.\n4.  The resulting mixture of DNA from the ligation reaction is used to transform a competent strain of *E. coli*.\n5.  The transformed cells are then plated onto nutrient agar plates containing ampicillin and X-gal.\n\nGiven this methodological error, which of the following outcomes is most likely to be observed after the plates are incubated?\n\nA. A large number of blue colonies and a very small number of white colonies.\n\nB. A large number of white colonies and a very small number of blue colonies.\n\nC. No colonies will grow on the plates.\n\nD. Only a few white colonies will grow on the plates.\n\nE. Approximately equal numbers of blue and white colonies.", "solution": "The plasmid pVector has a single HindIII site within the lacZ alpha region and carries ampicillin resistance. The insert is a 1.5 kb gene flanked by HindIII sites. After HindIII digestion, both vector and insert bear compatible cohesive ends with 5-prime phosphates, enabling DNA ligase to form phosphodiester bonds.\n\nAlkaline phosphatase treatment is normally used to remove 5-prime phosphates from the linearized vector to prevent vector self-ligation. In this experiment, the researcher omitted this step, so the digested vector retains 5-prime phosphates on both ends. Consequently, in the ligation reaction:\n- Intramolecular ligation of the vector ends (self-circularization) is efficient because both ends are phosphorylated and compatible. This restores the original plasmid with an intact lacZ alpha coding sequence, yielding a functional beta-galactosidase alpha-complementing fragment.\n- Insertion of the 1.5 kb gene into the HindIII site disrupts lacZ alpha, producing nonfunctional beta-galactosidase alpha.\n\nUpon transformation and plating on ampicillin plus X-gal:\n- Ampicillin selects for cells containing any circular plasmid (either self-ligated vector or recombinant).\n- X-gal reports lacZ alpha functionality: intact lacZ alpha yields blue colonies; disrupted lacZ alpha (insertional inactivation) yields white colonies.\n\nBecause the vector was not dephosphorylated, self-ligation is common and dominates over insertion events. Therefore, most transformants will be blue (intact lacZ alpha), with only a small fraction white (insert disrupts lacZ alpha).\n\nThus, the most likely observation is a large number of blue colonies and a very small number of white colonies, corresponding to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2090679"}]}
