The system operates using two primary components: the Cas9 protein, which acts as a molecular \"scissors\" (an endonuclease) to cut double-stranded DNA, and a guide RNA (gRNA). The gRNA is a synthetic RNA molecule composed of two key regions: a \"scaffold\" region that binds to the Cas9 protein to form a functional complex, and a \"spacer\" region of approximately 20 nucleotides that is complementary to a specific DNA sequence, thereby directing the Cas9 protein to that target site. For the Cas9 protein from *Streptococcus pyogenes* to cut the DNA, the target DNA sequence must be immediately followed by a specific short sequence known as the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM).\n\nA microbiologist has successfully designed a CRISPR-Cas9 system to disrupt Gene A in a culture of *Escherichia coli*. The system is working effectively. The researcher now wishes to use the same fundamental approach to disrupt a different gene, Gene B, which has a completely unrelated DNA sequence. Which of the following components must the researcher redesign to redirect the CRISPR-Cas9 system to target Gene B?\n\nA. The entire Cas9 protein to recognize Gene B.\n\nB. The spacer region of the guide RNA.\n\nC. The scaffold region of the guide RNA.\n\nD. The Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence.\n\nE. The promoter that controls the expression of the Cas9 protein.", "solution": "The CRISPR-Cas9 system from Streptococcus pyogenes achieves target specificity through Watson-Crick base pairing between the spacer region of the guide RNA and the complementary protospacer sequence in the DNA. The Cas9 protein binds the guide RNA via the scaffold region, forming the active ribonucleoprotein complex, and it recognizes a short PAM sequence in the DNA (for SpCas9, typically NGG) through protein-DNA interaction. DNA cleavage occurs only when both conditions are met: the presence of a correct PAM adjacent to the protospacer and successful base pairing between the spacer and the DNA target.\n\nTo retarget the system from Gene A to Gene B while keeping the same Cas9 protein, the researcher must change the sequence that determines base-pairing specificity. This is exclusively encoded by the spacer region of the guide RNA. The scaffold region should remain unchanged because it is responsible for binding Cas9, not for target recognition. The PAM sequence is a property of the genomic DNA at the target site and is recognized by Cas9; it is not redesigned in the guide RNA and cannot be altered in the genome without additional editing. The Cas9 protein itself determines the PAM requirement and cleavage activity; it does not need redesign for a new target as long as a suitable PAM exists near the new site. The promoter controlling Cas9 expression affects expression level, not target specificity.\n\nTherefore, to redirect targeting to Gene B, the researcher must redesign the spacer region of the guide RNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2060713"}, {"introduction": "While the guide RNA provides the specific \"address\" for the Cas9 nuclease, the enzyme will not engage with the DNA unless a second condition is met. This practice [@problem_id:2060720] uses a thought experiment to investigate the crucial role of the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) and its corresponding recognition domain on the Cas9 protein. This highlights the two-factor authentication system—gRNA sequence and PAM site—that ensures precision in the bacterial immune response and in gene editing applications.", "problem": "In a molecular biology laboratory, a research team is studying the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system from *Streptococcus pyogenes*. The Cas9 protein, when complexed with a guide RNA (gRNA), is directed to a specific target DNA sequence. The functionality of this system relies on several key protein domains. One such domain is the PAM-Interacting (PI) domain, which is responsible for recognizing a short DNA sequence known as the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM), typically 5'-NGG-3', located immediately downstream of the target DNA sequence (the protospacer).\n\nThe team engineers a mutant version of the Cas9 protein in which the entire PI domain has been deleted. They then assemble this mutant Cas9 protein with a gRNA designed to target a specific gene in a bacterial chromosome. The target sequence within this gene is immediately followed by a canonical 5'-AGG-3' PAM sequence. This engineered system (mutant Cas9 + gRNA) is then introduced into the bacteria.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the functional outcome of using this PI-domain-deleted Cas9 protein in the described experiment?\n\nA. The mutant Cas9-gRNA complex will be unable to stably bind to the target DNA locus, and thus no DNA cleavage will occur.\n\nB. The mutant Cas9-gRNA complex will bind to the correct target DNA sequence guided by the gRNA, but the nuclease domains will fail to activate, resulting in no DNA cleavage.\n\nC. The function of the mutant Cas9-gRNA complex will be unaffected by the deletion, as the gRNA provides sufficient specificity for both binding and cleavage.\n\nD. The mutant Cas9-gRNA complex will lose its specificity, binding and cleaving DNA at random locations throughout the bacterial chromosome.\n\nE. The mutant Cas9-gRNA complex will bind to the target DNA locus and cleave the DNA, but it will cut within the PAM sequence instead of the protospacer.", "solution": "Mechanistic principle: For Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), target recognition begins with specific binding to a Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM), typically 5'-NGG-3'. This PAM recognition is mediated by the PAM-Interacting (PI) domain. PAM binding is the gatekeeping step that (i) enables stable docking on DNA, (ii) licenses local DNA unwinding adjacent to the PAM, and (iii) permits RNA-DNA heteroduplex (R-loop) formation when the protospacer matches the guide RNA. Only after PAM recognition and R-loop formation do the HNH and RuvC nuclease domains undergo conformational activation to cleave the target and non-target DNA strands, respectively, at a defined position upstream of the PAM.\n\nLogical sequence for wild-type SpCas9:\n1. PI domain recognizes 5'-NGG-3' PAM adjacent to the protospacer.\n2. Stable DNA binding occurs at the PAM site.\n3. DNA unwinding adjacent to PAM allows the gRNA to interrogate the protospacer.\n4. If complementarity is sufficient, an R-loop forms.\n5. Conformational activation of HNH and RuvC results in cleavage within the protospacer at a fixed distance from the PAM, not within the PAM itself.\n\nConsequence of deleting the PI domain:\n1. Loss of PAM recognition abolishes the initial, essential docking step.\n2. Without stable PAM-dependent binding, DNA interrogation is severely impaired; transient, nonspecific DNA contacts are insufficient to promote R-loop formation.\n3. In the absence of PAM recognition and R-loop formation, the HNH and RuvC nuclease domains do not activate, so cleavage does not occur.\n4. The absence of PI-mediated PAM binding does not increase random cleavage; rather, it prevents activation entirely, reducing both on-target and off-target cleavage to negligible levels.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Correct. Without the PI domain, the Cas9-gRNA complex cannot stably bind the PAM-adjacent target and therefore cannot cleave DNA.\n- B: Incorrect, because binding itself is PAM-dependent; the complex will not effectively bind the correct locus in the first place.\n- C: Incorrect, because the gRNA does not substitute for PAM recognition; PAM is strictly required for stable binding and activation.\n- D: Incorrect, because nuclease activation is tightly coupled to PAM recognition and R-loop formation; random cleavage is not expected.\n- E: Incorrect, because cleavage does not occur within the PAM and, moreover, the mutant cannot carry out cleavage without PAM recognition.\n\nTherefore, the prediction is that the complex fails to stably bind and no cleavage occurs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2060720"}, {"introduction": "In an ideal world, the CRISPR-Cas9 system would only cleave its intended target, but in reality, off-target effects are a major concern.
