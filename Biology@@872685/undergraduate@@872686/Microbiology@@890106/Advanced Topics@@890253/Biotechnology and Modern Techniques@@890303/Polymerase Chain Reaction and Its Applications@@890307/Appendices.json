This fundamental exercise focuses on calculating the size of the PCR product, or 'amplicon', based on the binding locations of the primers. Mastering this simple calculation [@problem_id:2086795] is the first step in designing a successful experiment and correctly interpreting its results, for instance, when analyzing a DNA gel.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating a specific gene, designated `xtrA`, in a bacterial strain that possesses a single, linear chromosome. The goal is to amplify the entire coding sequence of the `xtrA` gene using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique.\n\nBased on the sequenced genome, the forward primer is designed to bind to the template DNA strand such that its 5' end aligns with base pair position 345,112. This primer is 21 nucleotides long. The reverse primer is designed to bind to the complementary strand, and its 5' end corresponds to base pair position 346,934 on the original template strand. The reverse primer is 23 nucleotides long.\n\nAssuming the PCR amplification is successful and there are no mutations in the target region, calculate the exact size of the resulting PCR product (the amplicon). Express your answer in base pairs (bp).", "solution": "The amplicon boundaries in PCR are defined by the outermost positions of the two primers, which correspond to the 5' ends of the forward and reverse primers when mapped onto the same reference (template) coordinate system. If the forward primer 5' end aligns at coordinate $x$ and the reverse primer 5' end corresponds to coordinate $y$ on the original template strand, then the amplified product spans from $x$ through $y$ inclusive. The length in base pairs is therefore the inclusive interval length:\n$$L = y - x + 1.$$\n\nFrom the problem:\n- Forward primer 5' end at position $x = 345112$.\n- Reverse primer 5' end corresponds to position $y = 346934$.\n\nThus,\n$$L = 346934 - 345112 + 1 = 1823.$$\n\nNote that the individual primer lengths (21 nt and 23 nt) do not alter this calculation because the 5' end coordinates already mark the outer boundaries of the amplicon; the amplicon includes the full primer sequences at both ends, and its size is fully determined by the distance between these 5' ends on the reference coordinate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1823}$$", "id": "2086795"}, {"introduction": "The power of PCR lies in its ability to generate billions of copies from just a few starting molecules, a process known as exponential amplification. This practice challenges you to think critically about the mechanism that makes this possible by exploring a hypothetical scenario where the standard protocol is broken [@problem_id:2086829]. By dissecting why a reaction with two forward primers fails to produce exponential growth, you will solidify your understanding of the roles of primer orientation and template generation in a successful PCR.", "problem": "A microbiology student is performing a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) experiment to amplify a specific gene from a linear, double-stranded bacterial DNA template. A standard PCR protocol utilizes a pair of primers—a forward primer and a a reverse primer—which are short, single-stranded nucleic acid sequences. In a successful reaction, these primers bind to opposite strands of the denatured DNA template and flank the target region, allowing a DNA polymerase to synthesize new DNA strands and leading to an exponential amplification of the specific segment between the primers.\n\nIn a procedural error, the student prepares the reaction mixture containing the bacterial DNA template, a thermostable DNA polymerase, all four deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), and appropriate buffer. However, instead of a forward-reverse primer pair, the student accidentally adds two different *forward* primers, F1 and F2. Both F1 and F2 are designed to anneal to different, non-overlapping sites on the same strand (the antisense strand) of the DNA template. No reverse primer is present in the mixture.\n\nAssuming the primers F1 and F2 successfully anneal at their intended complementary sites and the polymerase is active, what is the expected primary outcome of this reaction after 30 cycles?\n\nA. Linear amplification of single-stranded DNA fragments.\n\nB. Exponential amplification of a double-stranded DNA fragment.\n\nC. No amplification of any kind will occur.\n\nD. Exponential amplification of the entire DNA template molecule.\n\nE. Exponential amplification of two distinct double-stranded DNA fragments.", "solution": "PCR achieves exponential amplification only when two primers of opposite orientation bind flanking sites on opposite strands of the template, so that after extension each new strand contains a binding site for the other primer in subsequent cycles. This creates a feedback in which products from one cycle become templates for both primers in the next, generating double-stranded amplicons bounded by the primers and growing approximately as a power of two with cycles.\n\nIn the described setup, only two forward primers, F1 and F2, are present. By design, a forward primer is complementary to the antisense strand and identical in sequence to the sense strand. Therefore:\n- Upon denaturation, the antisense and sense template strands separate.\n- During annealing, F1 and F2 can bind only to the antisense strand at their respective non-overlapping sites; there is no primer that binds the sense strand.\n- During extension, DNA polymerase extends from F1 and F2 in the 5' to 3' direction on the antisense template, synthesizing new sense-strand products. These products are initially paired with the antisense template but, after denaturation, exist as single-stranded sense molecules.\n\nCritically, because the forward primers are identical in sequence to the sense strand, they do not anneal to these newly synthesized sense strands (they lack complementarity). Thus, the new products do not serve as templates for further priming by F1 or F2. Only the original antisense templates (and any antisense strands present from the original genomic duplex) can be primed in each cycle.\n\nConsequently:\n- In each cycle, extension can occur only from primers bound to antisense templates, producing new single-stranded sense products.\n- The quantity of product increases proportionally to the number of cycles (and the number of available antisense templates), i.e., linear amplification.\n- The products generated are single-stranded DNA fragments (originating from F1 and F2 start sites), not double-stranded amplicons, and there is no exponential amplification.\n\nTherefore, after 30 cycles, the primary outcome is linear amplification of single-stranded DNA fragments.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2086829"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple amplification, PCR is a powerful tool for precise molecular detection, capable of distinguishing between nearly identical DNA sequences. This advanced problem puts you in the role of a diagnostic designer tasked with a common and critical challenge: creating a test that can differentiate a functional gene from a closely related pseudogene [@problem_id:2086832]. This practice demonstrates the principles of allele-specific PCR, where subtle primer design choices, particularly at the 3' end, are exploited to achieve high specificity.", "problem": "A microbiologist is studying the bacterium *Pathogenica perniciosa*, which possesses a critical virulence gene designated `vrtA`. A related, non-pathogenic laboratory strain of the same species contains a homologous but non-functional pseudogene, `vrtA-psi`. To develop a rapid diagnostic test, the microbiologist needs to design a set of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) primers that will specifically amplify a DNA segment from the functional `vrtA` gene, but not from the `vrtA-psi` pseudogene.\n\nBelow are the 5' to 3' sequences of the sense strands for a relevant region of both the gene and the pseudogene.

Principle: DNA polymerase requires a correctly base-paired 3' terminal nucleotide to extend; a 3' mismatch strongly suppresses amplification.\n\n1) Identify the SNP position in the sense strand.\n- From the given sequences, the two sense strands are identical except for the bolded base:\n  - `vrtA`: ...GCGT A GTCGATCGAGCATGCTAGTCGTAGCTAGCA...\n  - `vrtA-psi`: ...GCGT C GTCGATCGAGCATGCTAGTCGTAGCTAGCA...\n- Thus, at the SNP position, the sense base is A in `vrtA` and C in `vrtA-psi`. The 20 bases immediately downstream of the SNP in `vrtA` are:\n  - Sense segment starting at the SNP in `vrtA`: AGTCGATCGAGCATGCTAGT\n\n2) Forward primer analysis.\n- All options A–D use the same forward primer 5'-AATGCATTACGATCGATTCG-3'. This sequence occurs identically in both `vrtA` and `vrtA-psi`, so it does not confer specificity. Specificity must therefore come from the reverse primer. (Option E has a different forward primer, but we analyze it in step 4).\n\n3) Reverse primer design logic for specificity.\n- A reverse primer anneals to the antisense strand; its reverse complement (RC) must match the sense strand.\n- To discriminate at the SNP, the reverse primer’s 3' base must be complementary to the sense base at the SNP:\n  - For `vrtA` (sense base A), the reverse primer’s 3' base must be T.\n  - For `vrtA-psi` (sense base C), the reverse primer’s 3' base must be G.\n- Moreover, to place the SNP at the reverse primer’s 3' end, the RC of the reverse primer must equal the 20-base sense segment that begins at the SNP (for the listed 20-mer primers).\n\n4) Evaluate each reverse primer by computing its reverse complement and comparing to the `vrtA` sense segment AGTCGATCGAGCATGCTAGT.\n\n- Option C reverse: 5'-ACTAGCATGCTCGATCGACT-3'\n  - RC computation: reverse the sequence and complement, yielding RC = AGTCGATCGAGCATGCTAGT.\n  - This RC exactly matches the `vrtA` sense segment starting at the SNP.\n  - The reverse primer’s 3' base is T, complementary to A at the SNP in `vrtA`, ensuring perfect 3' pairing in `vrtA` and a 3' mismatch in `vrtA-psi` (which has C).\n\n- Option D reverse: 5'-ACTAGCATGCTCGATCGACG-3'\n  - Only differs from C at the 3' base, which is G.\n  - RC starts with C, i.e., RC = CGTCGATCGAGCATGCTAGT.\n  - That RC matches the `vrtA-psi` sense segment starting at the SNP (C...), not `vrtA`. Hence D would preferentially amplify the pseudogene.\n\n- Option B reverse: 5'-ACTAGCATGCTCGATCGACA-3'\n  - 3' base is A; RC starts with T, i.e., RC = TGTCGATCGAGCATGCTAGT.\n  - This does not match either sense sequence at the SNP (which are A or C), causing a 3' mismatch in both and thus poor amplification of either.\n\n- Option E:\n  - Forward primer: 5'-AATGCATTACGATCGTCGATGCGTA-3'. Its reverse complement is TACGCATCGACGATCGTAATGCATT, which does not appear to provide a useful forward anchor.\n  - Reverse primer: 5'-GCTACGATCGTCGATGCGTA-3'. Its RC is TACGCATCGACGATCGTAGC, which does not align as the sense segment starting at the SNP. Moreover, its 3' base is A (not T), so it does not provide the correct 3' complement to the `vrtA` SNP base.\n\n- Option A reverse: 5'-TGCTAGCTACGACTAGCATG-3'\n  - Its RC is CATGCTAGTCGTAGCTAGCA, which aligns downstream and does not place the SNP at the 3' end; thus it cannot exploit the SNP for specificity.\n\n5) Conclusion.\n- Only option C positions the SNP at the reverse primer’s 3' end with a perfect match to `vrtA` (3' T pairing with sense A) and a terminal mismatch to `vrtA-psi` (3' T vs sense C), thereby selectively amplifying `vrtA` and failing to amplify `vrtA-psi`.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2086832"}]}
