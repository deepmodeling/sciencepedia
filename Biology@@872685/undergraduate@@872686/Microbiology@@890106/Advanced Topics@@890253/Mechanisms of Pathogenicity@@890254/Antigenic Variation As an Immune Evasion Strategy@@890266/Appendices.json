This practice challenges you to act like a molecular detective, examining the genomic organization of a hypothetical pathogen to determine how it shuffles its antigenic identity. By comparing different DNA-level mechanisms, you will learn to identify the classic hallmarks of a gene conversion system, a powerful strategy used by many real-world pathogens to stay one step ahead of the immune system. [@problem_id:2052541]", "problem": "A microbiologist discovers a new pathogenic bacterium, *Variabilibacter commutans*, which is known for its ability to cause recurrent infections by evading the host's adaptive immune response. Genomic analysis reveals that the bacterium has a single expression locus, designated `ompE`, which codes for a major outer membrane protein that is the primary target of host antibodies. Located downstream from `ompE` on the chromosome are approximately 80 different, promoter-less, and transcriptionally silent gene cassettes, collectively named `ompS`. Each `ompS` cassette contains a unique sequence encoding a functionally equivalent but antigenically distinct version of the outer membrane protein. The bacterium is observed to rapidly change the antigenic identity of the protein expressed from the `ompE` locus.\n\nBased on this genomic organization, which of the following is the most likely DNA-level mechanism responsible for this antigenic variation?\n\nA. Slipped-strand mispairing during DNA replication within a region of short tandem repeats in the `ompE` gene, causing a frameshift that results in a truncated, non-functional protein.\n\nB. A mobile genetic element known as a transposon, containing a promoter, randomly inserting itself upstream of one of the 80 silent `ompS` cassettes, thereby activating its transcription.\n\nC. A site-specific recombinase that inverts a DNA segment containing a promoter, causing it to alternately face either the `ompE` locus or a single adjacent `ompS` cassette.\n\nD. A non-reciprocal recombination event where a copy of one of the silent `ompS` cassettes is transferred to the `ompE` locus, replacing the sequence previously present at that site.\n\nE. A specialized bacteriophage that packages a random `ompS` cassette and injects it into a new recipient bacterium, a process known as generalized transduction.", "solution": "The key observations are: there is a single expression locus (ompE) that is the target of host antibodies; downstream there are approximately 80 promoter-less, transcriptionally silent cassettes (ompS), each encoding a functionally equivalent but antigenically distinct version of the same outer membrane protein; and the bacterium rapidly changes the antigenic identity of the protein expressed from the ompE locus. A mechanism that best explains this architecture and behavior is one in which silent cassettes serve as donors of sequence information that can be moved into the single expression site without altering their own silent status. This is the classic arrangement for antigenic variation by gene conversion: non-reciprocal homologous recombination copies sequence from a silent donor cassette into the expressed locus, thereby replacing the variable region at ompE while leaving the donor intact. This allows repeated, rapid switches among many antigenic variants using a single promoter-driven expression site, exactly as observed in systems such as Neisseria pilE/pilS and Borrelia vlsE.\n\nEvaluating the options:\nA describes slipped-strand mispairing in short tandem repeats causing frameshifts. That mechanism leads to phase variation (on/off states or length variation) and often produces truncated, non-functional products, not the repeated exchange among many antigenically distinct, yet functional, variants encoded in multiple silent cassettes. It does not match the presence of many silent, promoter-less cassettes nor the maintenance of function.\nB posits a transposon with a promoter inserting upstream of a silent cassette to activate it. This would drive expression at the cassette’s own locus, not at the single ompE expression site, and would rely on random insertion events that are not a controlled, rapid, and repeatable means to cycle among approximately 80 variants. It also does not explain why the silent cassettes are promoter-less yet the expression consistently occurs from ompE.\nC invokes promoter inversion to alternately face ompE or a single adjacent ompS. Promoter inversion typically toggles between two states and at most switches between a small number of targets, not among approximately 80 distinct cassettes. The described genomic organization does not support a single invertible promoter selectively addressing many downstream cassettes.\nD describes a non-reciprocal recombination (gene conversion) that copies a silent cassette into the ompE locus, replacing the previously expressed sequence. This precisely matches the presence of many promoter-less silent cassettes and a single expression locus, and it explains rapid, repeated antigenic switching while preserving functional equivalence and diversity.\nE describes phage-mediated transduction, which is a population-level horizontal transfer mechanism and does not account for rapid, within-lineage antigenic switching at a single expression locus. Furthermore, the wording conflates specialized and generalized transduction and is inconsistent with the observed within-genome cassette architecture.\n\nTherefore, the most likely mechanism is non-reciprocal recombination (gene conversion) from a silent cassette into the expression locus.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2052541"}, {"introduction": "A genetic switch for antigenic variation is only effective if it can alter the composition of the entire pathogen population.

To evade the host's adaptive immune system, which can produce antibodies targeting the flagellar protein (flagellin), *C. jejuni* employs a strategy called phase variation. This mechanism allows the bacterium to randomly switch the expression of its primary flagellin gene, *flaA*, on or off. When *flaA* is expressed, the bacterium is motile and antigenic (Fla+).

By quantifying the neutralization effectiveness of this skewed immune response, you will gain a concrete understanding of why prior immunity is not always perfect and why pathogens like influenza can cause recurrent illness. [@problem_id:2052547]", "problem": "A host's immune system often exhibits a phenomenon known as Original Antigenic Sin (OAS) when encountering a pathogen that has undergone antigenic drift. Consider a scenario where a patient is first infected with an influenza virus, Strain P. This primary infection establishes a robust population of memory B cells specific to Strain P's antigens. One year later, the same patient is infected with Strain Q, an antigenically drifted variant of Strain P.\n\nDue to OAS, the patient's secondary immune response to Strain Q is dominated by the rapid reactivation of memory B cells from the primary infection. This results in a large population of antibodies (Ab-P) that are highly specific to the original Strain P. A much smaller, concurrent primary response is mounted by naive B cells, which generate antibodies (Ab-Q) that are perfectly specific to the new Strain Q.\n\nLet's model the effectiveness of the antibody response. Assume that the relative abundance of an antibody type in the serum is proportional to the fraction of activated B cells producing it. In the response to Strain Q, 85.0% of the activated B cells are reactivated memory cells producing Ab-P, while the remaining 15.0% are newly activated naive cells producing Ab-Q.\n\nThe \"Neutralization Efficacy\" of an antibody sub-population against a specific viral strain is defined as its relative abundance multiplied by its binding affinity. The total \"Serum Neutralization Efficacy\" (SNE) against a virus is the sum of the efficacies of all antibody sub-populations present. Binding affinity is a dimensionless score from 0 (no binding) to 1 (perfect binding).\nThe newly produced Ab-Q antibodies have a perfect binding affinity of 1.0 for Strain Q. The older, cross-reactive Ab-P antibodies have a significantly lower binding affinity of 0.25 for the drifted antigens of Strain Q.\n\nTo quantify the qualitative deficiency of the OAS-driven response, compare the actual SNE against Strain Q to the SNE of a hypothetical \"ideal\" response. An ideal response would occur in a naive individual where 100% of the responding B cells would be dedicated to producing the perfectly-matched Ab-Q.
