{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Bacterial pathogens must accurately sense their environment to know when they have entered a host. One of the most common mechanisms for this is the two-component system, which acts as a molecular switch. This practice problem explores the fundamental logic of this system by asking you to predict the outcome when a key component, the response regulator, is unable to be activated, reinforcing your understanding of how these essential signaling pathways function [@problem_id:2083994].", "problem": "*Bacillus calamitosus* is a hypothetical gram-positive pathogen that causes disease by secreting exotoxins. The expression of these toxins is tightly controlled by a two-component regulatory system, designated the Exp system. This system consists of a membrane-bound sensor kinase, ExpS, and a cytoplasmic response regulator, ExpR. In the low-iron environment found within the host organism, ExpS autophosphorylates and subsequently transfers the phosphate group to ExpR. This phosphorylation event activates ExpR, enabling it to bind to the promoter region of the `tox` operon, which contains the genes for the exotoxins. The binding of phosphorylated ExpR acts as a transcriptional activator, initiating the synthesis of the toxins.\n\nA research laboratory generates a mutant strain of *B. calamitosus*. In this mutant, the gene for the response regulator has been altered, resulting in an ExpR protein that cannot be phosphorylated by ExpS. The mutation does not affect the protein's stability or its synthesis.\n\nIf this mutant strain is cultured in a low-iron medium that would normally induce high levels of toxin production in the wild-type strain, what is the most likely outcome for the expression of the `tox` operon?\n\nA. The `tox` operon will be constitutively expressed at a high level, regardless of the iron concentration.\nB. The `tox` operon will not be expressed, or its expression level will be negligible.\nC. The expression of the `tox` operon will be unaffected and will proceed normally in response to low iron.\nD. The ExpS sensor kinase will become hyper-phosphorylated to compensate for the inactive ExpR.\nE. The expression of the `tox` operon will now be repressed in low iron and activated in high iron.", "solution": "Two-component regulatory systems operate via phosphotransfer: a membrane-bound histidine kinase (sensor) autophosphorylates on a histidine residue in response to a stimulus and then transfers the phosphate to a conserved aspartate residue on the response regulator. The phosphorylated response regulator undergoes a conformational change that enables DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, often as an activator at target promoters.\n\nIn the wild-type strain under low-iron conditions, ExpS autophosphorylates and transfers the phosphate to ExpR. The phosphorylated ExpR binds the promoter of the tox operon and activates transcription, resulting in high toxin expression.\n\nIn the mutant described, ExpR cannot be phosphorylated by ExpS. The mutation does not affect ExpR abundance or stability, so the cellular level of ExpR is unchanged, but its activation by phosphorylation is abolished. Because activation of the tox operon requires the phosphorylated form of ExpR, the unphosphorylatable ExpR will fail to activate transcription. Therefore, tox expression will not be induced under low iron and will remain at negligible or basal levels.\n\nAssessment of options:\n- A is incorrect: constitutive high expression would require a phosphorylation-independent activation (e.g., a mutation mimicking the phosphorylated state), which is not the case; the mutant specifically cannot be phosphorylated.\n- B is correct: without phosphorylation, ExpR cannot activate transcription, so expression is absent or negligible.\n- C is incorrect: normal induction requires phosphorylation, which is abrogated.\n- D is incorrect: increased autophosphorylation of ExpS cannot compensate if phosphate cannot be transferred to ExpR; accumulation on ExpS does not activate the operon.\n- E is incorrect: the regulatory logic is not reversed; the activator has simply lost its activation mechanism.\n\nThus, the tox operon will not be expressed, or expression will be negligible.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2083994"}, {"introduction": "Virulence is not always a matter of simply activating genes; sometimes, it is about relieving repression. Many bacteria use global repressor proteins to keep powerful virulence arsenals silenced until the right moment. This exercise presents a real-world scenario with *Salmonella* where deleting a regulatory gene leads to a surprising *increase* in virulence, challenging you to think about the critical role of negative regulators in fine-tuning pathogenesis [@problem_id:2091409].", "problem": "A research team is investigating virulence regulation in the pathogenic bacterium *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhimurium. Their study focuses on the gene `hns`, which encodes the H-NS protein, a well-characterized global transcriptional repressor. The H-NS protein is known to bind to DNA and silence the expression of numerous genes, including many virulence factors located on large genetic cassettes called Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands (SPIs).\n\nTo probe the function of `hns` in pathogenesis, the researchers created a precise deletion mutant (`Δhns`) that lacks the entire gene. They then performed an infection study in a susceptible mouse model to determine the median lethal dose (LD50), which is the dose of bacteria required to kill 50% of the infected animals. The results were as follows:\n\n-   Wild-type (WT) *S. enterica*: LD50 = $6 \\times 10^5$ Colony Forming Units (CFUs)\n-   `Δhns` mutant *S. enterica*: LD50 = $2 \\times 10^3$ CFUs\n\nRecall that a lower LD50 value indicates higher virulence. This result, where the inactivation of a gene leads to a dramatic *increase* in virulence, appears to complicate a simplistic interpretation of Stanley Falkow's molecular postulates for determining virulence factors.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and direct molecular explanation for this observation, consistent with the known function of H-NS?\n\nA. The H-NS protein is a major surface antigen that is strongly recognized by the mouse immune system. Deleting the gene for this protein allows the bacterium to better evade immune detection, thus increasing its virulence.\nB. The observation is likely an artifact of the specific mouse strain used for the experiment. A different animal model would probably show the expected decrease in virulence predicted by the postulates.\nC. This result definitively invalidates Falkow's second molecular postulate, demonstrating that the framework is fundamentally flawed and not applicable to regulatory genes.\nD. As a global repressor, H-NS silences the expression of potent virulence genes on the SPIs. The absence of H-NS in the mutant leads to the inappropriate, high-level expression of these virulence factors, resulting in a hypervirulent phenotype due to dysregulation.", "solution": "We first interpret the phenotypic data using the definition of virulence as reflected by the median lethal dose, LD50. By definition, a lower LD50 indicates higher virulence because fewer bacteria are required to kill half of the host population. The reported values show that the wild type requires $6 \\times 10^{5}$ CFUs to reach LD50, whereas the $\\Delta hns$ mutant requires $2 \\times 10^{3}$ CFUs. Therefore, the $\\Delta hns$ mutant is more virulent than the wild type.\n\nNext, we connect this observation to the known molecular function of H-NS. H-NS is a nucleoid-associated, global transcriptional repressor that preferentially binds AT-rich DNA, including horizontally acquired sequences such as Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands (SPIs). It silences gene expression by binding to promoter and coding regions, oligomerizing along DNA, and repressing transcription initiation and elongation, thereby preventing inappropriate or premature expression of many genes, notably virulence factors encoded on SPIs.\n\nDeleting $hns$ removes this repression. The immediate molecular consequence is derepression and often high-level, dysregulated expression of H-NS-silenced genes, including potent virulence determinants (e.g., SPI-1 and SPI-2 genes involved in secretion systems and effectors). Such inappropriate, globally elevated expression can yield a hypervirulent phenotype in vivo, consistent with the observed reduction in LD50.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because H-NS is not a surface-exposed antigen; it is an intracellular DNA-binding protein and is not directly targeted as a major antigen by the host immune system.\n- Option B is an unsupported appeal to experimental artifact and does not provide a molecular explanation; moreover, it is inconsistent with extensive evidence that H-NS silences horizontally acquired virulence loci.\n- Option C is incorrect because this result does not invalidate Falkow’s molecular postulates; rather, it highlights that regulatory genes can inversely affect virulence upon loss-of-function if they normally repress virulence genes. The framework remains applicable with proper consideration of regulatory roles.\n- Option D directly matches the molecular mechanism: as a global repressor, H-NS silences virulence genes on SPIs; its absence leads to inappropriate, high-level expression and a hypervirulent phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and direct molecular explanation is provided by option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2091409"}, {"introduction": "Instead of having an entire population switch its gene expression on or off, some bacteria employ a \"bet-hedging\" strategy called phase variation to create a mix of phenotypes. This allows a subpopulation of cells to be prepared for environmental changes, such as immune system attack. This quantitative problem delves into the mechanism of slipped-strand mispairing, asking you to calculate the steady-state balance between 'ON' and 'OFF' states based on their switching rates, $k_{on}$ and $k_{off}$ [@problem_id:2084014].", "problem": "In the pathogenic bacterium *Pathogenix exemplaris*, host cell attachment is mediated by a fimbrial adhesin protein called FimX. The expression of this protein is subject to phase variation, a mechanism that generates phenotypic heterogeneity within the bacterial population. The gene encoding the adhesin, `fimX`, is located on a pathogenicity island and contains a simple sequence repeat, specifically a poly-guanine (poly-G) tract, within its coding region.\n\nThe state of FimX expression is determined by the length of this poly-G tract:\n- **'ON' state**: When the tract consists of 10 guanine residues (`G_10`), the downstream coding sequence is in the correct reading frame, leading to the synthesis of a full-length, functional FimX protein.\n- **'OFF' state**: When the tract consists of 9 guanine residues (`G_9`), a -1 frameshift occurs, resulting in a premature stop codon and the production of a truncated, non-functional protein.\n\nThe transition between these two states occurs randomly during DNA replication due to slipped-strand mispairing. The rate of switching from the 'OFF' state to the 'ON' state (an insertion event, `G_9` → `G_10`) is $k_{on} = 3.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ events per cell per generation. The rate of switching from the 'ON' state to the 'OFF' state (a deletion event, `G_10` → `G_9`) is $k_{off} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-2}$ events per cell per generation.\n\nAssuming a large population of *P. exemplaris* has reached a steady-state equilibrium where the fractions of 'ON' and 'OFF' cells are constant, and that there is no fitness difference between cells in either state (i.e., they have identical growth and death rates), calculate the fraction of the bacterial population that expresses functional FimX.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $x$ denote the steady-state fraction of cells in the 'ON' state (functional FimX expressed), and $1 - x$ the fraction in the 'OFF' state.

The rate of transition from 'OFF' to 'ON' per generation is $k_{on}(1 - x)$, and from 'ON' to 'OFF' is $k_{off}x$. At equilibrium, the net flow is zero, so\n$$\nk_{on}(1 - x) = k_{off} x.\n$$\nSolving for $x$,\n$$\nk_{on} - k_{on} x = k_{off} x \\;\\Rightarrow\\; k_{on} = (k_{on} + k_{off}) x \\;\\Rightarrow\\; x = \\frac{k_{on}}{k_{on} + k_{off}}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $k_{on} = 3.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ and $k_{off} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-2}$,\n$$\nx = \\frac{3.5 \\times 10^{-3}}{3.5 \\times 10^{-3} + 1.2 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\frac{3.5}{15.5} = \\frac{7}{31} \\approx 0.225806\\ldots\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, the steady-state fraction of the population expressing functional FimX is $0.226$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.226}$$", "id": "2084014"}]}
