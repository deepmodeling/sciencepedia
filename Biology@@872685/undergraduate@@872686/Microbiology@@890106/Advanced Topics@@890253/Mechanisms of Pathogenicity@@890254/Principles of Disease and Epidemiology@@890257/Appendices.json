This practice challenges you to step into the role of a public health investigator during a hypothetical outbreak. By calculating the relative risk, you will learn to quantify the impact of an environmental factor—in this case, contaminated doorknobs—on disease transmission and measure the success of a simple public health measure ([@problem_id:2087546]).", "problem": "A public health team is investigating an outbreak of a novel gastrointestinal virus, \"Norovirus-G,\" in a university dormitory. To assess the role of fomite transmission, a simple intervention study is conducted over a one-week period. The dormitory is divided into two identical wings, each housing a distinct population of students.\n\nIn the \"Control Wing,\" which houses 200 students, no special cleaning protocols are introduced beyond the standard daily custodial service.\n\nIn the \"Intervention Wing,\" which also houses 200 students, all common-area doorknobs are disinfected by a dedicated team on an hourly basis, from 7:00 AM to 11:00 PM daily.\n\nAt the end of the one-week study period, data on new cases of Norovirus-G gastroenteritis is collected. In the Control Wing, 45 students developed the illness. In the Intervention Wing, 12 students developed the illness.\n\nAssuming the doorknob disinfection is the only significant difference in exposure between the two wings, calculate the relative risk of developing the illness for students in the Control Wing compared to those in the Intervention Wing.

The disease caused by the virus has a characteristic feature: the time from symptom onset to death in fatal cases is often significantly shorter than the time from symptom onset to full recovery in non-fatal cases.\n\nOn Day 45 of the outbreak, the public health authority releases the following cumulative data for the city:\n- Total confirmed cases: 8,450\n- Total deaths: 625\n- Total recoveries: 1,875\n\nTo assess the lethality, two different metrics for the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) are considered:\n1.  **Crude CFR**: The ratio of the total number of deaths to the total number of confirmed cases.\n2.  **Resolved-case CFR**: The ratio of the total number of deaths to the total number of cases with a resolved outcome (i.e., the sum of deaths and recoveries).\n\nWhich of the following options correctly reports the Crude CFR and the Resolved-case CFR, respectively, based on the data from Day 45?

This problem moves beyond analyzing static data to engage with the principles of mathematical modeling, a powerful tool in modern microbiology. By analyzing an equation that describes the fate of a resistance plasmid, you will explore the dynamic interplay between the fitness cost of a trait ($s$), its rate of loss ($\\gamma$), and its ability to spread via horizontal gene transfer ($\\beta$) to determine if resistance can persist in a population even without antibiotics ([@problem_id:2087577]).", "problem": "Consider a large, well-mixed bacterial population maintained in a chemostat, an environment with a constant supply of nutrients and a constant outflow of culture. The population consists of two strains: one carrying a specific antibiotic-resistance plasmid ($B_P$) and one that is plasmid-free and thus susceptible ($B_S$). The environment is free of antibiotics. The plasmid confers a fitness cost to its host bacteria, reducing their replication rate. Conversely, the plasmid can be transferred from a $B_P$ bacterium to a $B_S$ bacterium via conjugation. Plasmids can also be lost during cell division (segregational loss).\n\nLet $p$ be the frequency of plasmid-carrying bacteria ($B_P$) in the total population.
