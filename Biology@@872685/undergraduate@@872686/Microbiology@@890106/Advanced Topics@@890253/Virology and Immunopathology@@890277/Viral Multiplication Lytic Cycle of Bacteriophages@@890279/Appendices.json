The experiment begins with a well-mixed liquid culture of *E. coli* in a flask with a volume of $50.0$ mL. The initial concentration of bacteria is $C_B = 3.0 \\times 10^8$ cells/mL, a quantity considered vast enough that host availability is not a limiting factor for the duration of the experiment.\n\nAt time $t=0$, a stock of T-Prime phage is introduced into the culture, resulting in an initial phage concentration of $P_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^4$ plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL.\n\nThe following has been determined about the T-Prime lytic cycle:\n- The time from phage infection to host cell lysis, known as the latent period, is exactly $T_L = 30$ minutes.\n- At the beginning of each infectious cycle, it is observed that $90\\%$ of the available phages successfully adsorb to and infect a unique host cell nearly instantaneously. The remaining $10\\%$ fail to infect.\n- The experiment is run for a total time of $t_{total} = 60$ minutes.

This problem challenges you to think like a microbiologist and predict the outcome of an infection in a metabolically dormant bacterial cell. Analyzing this scenario will deepen your understanding of why phages are considered obligate intracellular parasites and highlight the intricate link between viral replication and host cell biology. [@problem_id:2104685]", "problem": "A microbiologist is studying the infection dynamics of the strictly lytic bacteriophage T4 on its host, *Escherichia coli*. The T4 bacteriophage relies on the host cell's machinery and resources to replicate. The lytic cycle is characterized by the injection of phage genetic material, followed by the synthesis of phage components, assembly of new virions, and finally lysis (rupture) of the host cell to release the progeny.\n\nThe experiment compares two populations of *E. coli*:\n1.  A culture in the exponential (logarithmic) growth phase, characterized by rapid cell division and high metabolic activity.\n2.  A culture in the late stationary phase, where cell growth has ceased due to nutrient depletion. Cells in this phase have a significantly reduced metabolic rate and possess very limited intracellular pools of biosynthetic precursors, such as amino acids, nucleotides, and Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nA high multiplicity of infection is used for both cultures, ensuring that nearly all bacterial cells are infected by at least one T4 phage. Based on your understanding of the bacteriophage lytic cycle and bacterial physiology, what is the most likely outcome for the *E. coli* cells in the stationary-phase culture after the T4 phages have injected their genetic material?\n\nA. The phage will complete the lytic cycle, but at a much slower rate and with a significantly smaller burst size compared to the exponential-phase culture.\n\nB. The phage will fail to productively infect the cells because changes in the stationary-phase cell envelope prevent the initial attachment or injection of genetic material.\n\nC. The phage, unable to replicate lytically, will integrate its genome into the host chromosome and enter a lysogenic state, becoming a dormant prophage.\n\nD. The lytic cycle will be arrested after the injection of the phage genome; synthesis of new phage components will not occur, resulting in a non-productive infection where the host cell does not lyse.\n\nE. The injection of foreign DNA into the metabolically stressed stationary-phase cells will cause immediate structural failure of the cell envelope, leading to premature lysis without the production of any new virions.", "solution": "We identify the key constraints of the scenario and evaluate the options using established principles of bacteriophage biology and bacterial physiology.\n\nFirst, with a high multiplicity of infection, adsorption and genome injection will occur in nearly all cells. Thus, the primary bottleneck will not be reaching the cytoplasm but what happens after the phage genome enters the cell.\n\nSecond, T4 is a strictly lytic bacteriophage. It does not possess a lysogenic program and does not integrate as a prophage. Therefore, any option that invokes lysogeny is inconsistent with T4 biology. This eliminates option C.\n\nThird, we consider the possibility that stationary-phase cell envelope changes prevent attachment or injection. While stationary-phase cells can alter envelope composition and receptor availability, such changes are not absolute. With high multiplicity of infection and the known ability of T4 to bind to its receptors on many E. coli strains even outside exponential growth, complete prevention of attachment/injection is unlikely to be the dominant outcome. Therefore, option B is less likely than intracellular arrest.\n\nFourth, the lytic cycle after injection requires:\n- Transcription of early phage genes by host RNA polymerase (often modified by phage factors) and translation by host ribosomes, which demands ATP and GTP.\n- Phage DNA replication, which requires dNTP pools and energy.\n- Translation of structural proteins and assembly, requiring amino acids and ATP/GTP.\n- Expression of lysis functions (e.g., endolysins/hydrolases), which also requires transcription and translation.\n\nIn late stationary-phase cells, intracellular pools of ATP, amino acids, and nucleotides are severely limited. The stringent response suppresses ribosomal RNA synthesis and global translation, and overall metabolic flux is greatly reduced. Even though T4 encodes factors to redirect host machinery and can degrade host DNA to liberate nucleotides, the strong energy and precursor limitations in late stationary phase impede transcription, translation, and DNA replication to the extent that productive phage synthesis does not occur. Without synthesis of lysis proteins, programmed lysis will not proceed.\n\nFifth, we consider whether a slower, reduced-yield lytic cycle could still occur. In mildly nutrient-limited or slow-growth conditions, some phages do complete infection with longer latent periods and smaller burst sizes. However, the problem specifies late stationary phase with “very limited” pools of precursors and ATP, indicating a regime where macromolecular synthesis is largely arrested. Under such conditions, T4 infections are commonly non-productive until nutrients are restored. Thus, option A is less consistent with the described metabolic state.\n\nSixth, we examine whether injection itself could cause immediate structural failure (lysis from without). True lysis from without typically requires extremely high numbers of adsorbed phages causing mechanical damage or overwhelming cell wall–degrading activities, and it is not a general consequence of genome injection per se. The problem statement does not indicate such an extreme condition, and immediate lysis without virion production is not the expected outcome for T4 solely due to injection into metabolically stressed cells. Thus, option E is unlikely.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that the lytic cycle arrests after genome injection due to insufficient energy and precursors for transcription, translation, and replication, with no production of new virions and no lysis.

This exercise explores the consequences of disrupting this timing, using a hypothetical mutant phage that undergoes premature lysis.
