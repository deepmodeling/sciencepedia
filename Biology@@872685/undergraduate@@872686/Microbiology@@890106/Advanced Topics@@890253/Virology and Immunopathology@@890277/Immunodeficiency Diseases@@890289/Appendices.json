This practice focuses on a key functional assay for neutrophils, the frontline soldiers of the innate immune system. You will analyze data from a Dihydrorhodamine (DHR) test, a standard method for diagnosing Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD), to quantify the neutrophil's 'oxidative burst' and see firsthand how a simple calculation can reveal a profound cellular defect.

His medical history is significant for multiple skin abscesses and a bout of pneumonia caused by *Aspergillus fumigatus*. His family history reveals that a maternal uncle had similar issues. Suspecting an inherited immunodeficiency, the clinical immunologist orders a functional assay for the patient's neutrophils.\n\nThe assay used is the Dihydrorhodamine (DHR) 123 test. In this test, neutrophils are incubated with DHR, a non-fluorescent compound. The cells are then split into two samples: one is left resting (unstimulated), and the other is activated with a potent chemical stimulant that triggers the \"oxidative burst\". During a normal oxidative burst, the Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH) oxidase enzyme complex generates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). These ROS oxidize DHR into rhodamine 123, a highly fluorescent green molecule. The fluorescence of thousands of individual cells is measured using flow cytometry, and the result is reported as the geometric Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI). A failure of the oxidative burst is the hallmark of Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD).\n\nThe results from the laboratory for both the patient and a healthy age-matched control are as follows:\n- **Healthy Control**:\n  - Resting (unstimulated) MFI: $12.5$\n  - Stimulated MFI: $1562.5$\n- **Patient**:\n  - Resting (unstimulated) MFI: $11.8$\n  - Stimulated MFI: $14.1$\n\nTo quantify the neutrophil response, a \"Stimulation Index\" (SI) is calculated, which is defined as the ratio of the MFI of the stimulated sample to the MFI of the resting sample.\n\nCalculate the Stimulation Index for the patient. Report your answer as a dimensionless quantity rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The objective is to calculate the Stimulation Index (SI) for the patient based on the provided experimental data.\n\nThe problem statement defines the Stimulation Index as the ratio of the Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) of the stimulated neutrophils to the MFI of the resting (unstimulated) neutrophils. The formula is:\n$$ \\text{SI} = \\frac{\\text{MFI}_{\\text{stimulated}}}{\\text{MFI}_{\\text{resting}}} $$\n\nThis index measures the fold-increase in fluorescence upon stimulation, which directly reflects the capacity of the neutrophils to produce Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) via the oxidative burst.\n\nThe problem provides MFI data for both a healthy control and the patient. We are asked to calculate the SI specifically for the patient. Therefore, we must use the data from the \"Patient\" category. The data for the healthy control is provided for context and comparison but is not needed for this calculation.\n\nThe patient's data is:\n- Resting (unstimulated) MFI = $11.8$\n- Stimulated MFI = $14.1$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the formula for the Stimulation Index:\n$$ \\text{SI}_{\\text{patient}} = \\frac{14.1}{11.8} $$\n\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$ \\text{SI}_{\\text{patient}} \\approx 1.194915254... $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Let's examine the calculated value, $1.194915254...$.\nThe first three significant figures are 1, 1, and 9. The fourth digit is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, we round down, which means we keep the third significant digit as it is.\n\nThus, the rounded Stimulation Index for the patient is $1.19$.\n\nFor context, the healthy control's SI would be $\\frac{1562.5}{12.5} = 125$.

This exercise introduces you to immunophenotyping, a powerful diagnostic approach using flow cytometry to identify and count different types of lymphocytes. By interpreting data on T-cell (CD3+), B-cell (CD19+), and Natural Killer cell (CD16+/56+) populations, you will learn to classify different forms of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), one of the most critical pediatric emergencies.

His family history is significant for a maternal uncle who died in infancy from an unknown infection. Suspecting a primary immunodeficiency, the physician orders a complete blood count, which reveals lymphopenia (abnormally low number of lymphocytes). To further characterize the lymphocyte populations, a sample of the infant's peripheral blood is analyzed by flow cytometry using fluorescent antibodies against specific cell surface markers.

These features point to a severe T cell immunodeficiency, often X-linked.\n\nInterpretation of flow cytometry:\n- CD3+ (T cells) are markedly reduced: the patient has 2% of lymphocytes, compared with a reference range of 60% to 80%.\n- CD19+ (B cells) are relatively increased in proportion: the patient has 97% of lymphocytes, compared with a reference range of 10% to 25%.

The analysis shows that the Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs (ITAMs) of the CD3 zeta-chain are robustly phosphorylated.

In vitro TCR stimulation via anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 yields no IL-2 and no proliferation, confirming a T-cell activation defect.\n\nThe proximal TCR signaling cascade proceeds as follows:\n1. Upon TCR engagement, the Src-family kinase Lck phosphorylates ITAMs on the CD3$\\zeta$ chain. Symbolically: $\\text{ITAM} \\to \\text{pITAM}$ mediated by Lck.\n2.

If Lck were defective, ITAM phosphorylation would be absent, which contradicts the data. The lack of ZAP-70 phosphorylation implies ZAP-70 is absent or nonfunctional. Because LAT is a downstream substrate of ZAP-70, absence of LAT phosphorylation is explained by failure to activate ZAP-70.\n- PMA (a direct activator of PKC) plus ionomycin (which increases intracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$) restores normal IL-2 production. This pharmacologic bypass indicates that the downstream pathway from DAG and $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to transcription is intact, and the defect lies upstream of PLC-$\\gamma_1$ activation.\n\nEvaluate answer choices:\nA. RAG1: Defective V(D)J recombination yields markedly reduced mature T and B cells; inconsistent with normal CD3 and CD19 counts and does not explain the specific proximal signaling defect pattern.\nB. Lck: If Lck were defective, CD3$\\zeta$ ITAMs would not be phosphorylated; this contradicts the observed robust ITAM phosphorylation.\nC. ZAP-70: Absence or dysfunction prevents ZAP-70 phosphorylation and blocks LAT phosphorylation; ITAM phosphorylation remains intact via Lck. PMA plus ionomycin rescues IL-2 by bypassing the proximal block. This matches all findings.\nD. PLC-$\\gamma_1$: A defect here would still allow ZAP-70 and LAT phosphorylation upon TCR stimulation; the blot would show pZAP-70 and pLAT present. The observed absence of both pZAP-70 and pLAT rules this out.\nE. $\\gamma_c$: Common gamma chain defects impair cytokine receptor signaling and cause a developmental phenotype (typically T-NK-B+), not a selective proximal TCR signaling defect with normal ITAM phosphorylation.\n\nTherefore, the protein most likely defective or absent is ZAP-70.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2072980"}]}
