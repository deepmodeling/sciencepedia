This exercise [@problem_id:2351425] focuses on the very first decision point in this journey: the targeting of a newly forming protein to the ER membrane. You will explore the critical role of the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) and its receptor in guiding proteins into the secretory pathway, and predict the consequences when this essential handshake fails.", "problem": "In a research model of a specific channelopathy, a genetic mutation is introduced into a line of cultured neurons. This mutation causes a loss-of-function in the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) receptor, a protein complex embedded in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The mutation renders the receptor completely unable to bind to the SRP.\n\nConsider the synthesis and trafficking of a nascent voltage-gated sodium channel ($Na_v$), which is a large, multi-pass transmembrane protein essential for generating action potentials. In a neuron expressing this defective SRP receptor, where would the fully translated, but improperly processed, $Na_v$ protein primarily accumulate?\n\nA. Correctly inserted and functional in the neuronal plasma membrane.\n\nB. Freely dissolved within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nC. Aggregated or processed for degradation within the cytoplasm.\n\nD. Trapped within transport vesicles destined for the Golgi apparatus.\n\nE. Secreted out of the neuron into the extracellular medium.", "solution": "Principle of co-translational targeting: Secretory and integral membrane proteins carry hydrophobic signal sequences that are recognized in the cytosol by the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP). SRP binding pauses translation and forms an SRP–ribosome–nascent chain complex. Proper ER targeting requires docking of this complex to the SRP receptor (SR) on the ER membrane. SRP–SR interaction enables handoff of the ribosome to the Sec61 translocon, GTP-dependent release of SRP, and resumption of co-translational translocation/insertion. Multi-pass transmembrane proteins like $Na_v$ require repeated engagement with the translocon for correct membrane insertion and topology. Subsequent ER quality control and vesicular trafficking deliver properly folded channels to the plasma membrane.\n\nEffect of an SRP receptor loss-of-function that abolishes SRP binding: The SRP can still bind the emerging signal sequence and pause translation, but without SRP–SR docking, the complex cannot engage the ER translocon. Consequently, co-translational translocation/insertion into the ER does not occur. The stalled complex is resolved in the cytosol: translation either resumes or is terminated outside the ER. In mammalian cells, post-translational ER insertion of large multi-pass membrane proteins is not an efficient or operative pathway; thus, a fully synthesized $Na_v$ polypeptide remains in the cytosol.\n\nFate of a cytosolically synthesized multi-pass membrane protein: The $Na_v$ channel contains numerous hydrophobic transmembrane segments. In the aqueous cytosol, such a polypeptide cannot properly fold or insert into membranes and will expose hydrophobic regions, leading to misfolding and aggregation. Cytosolic protein quality control pathways (chaperones, ubiquitination, and the proteasome) target these mislocalized proteins for degradation; before degradation, they tend to accumulate as cytosolic aggregates or in quality-control compartments.\n\nExclusion of alternatives:\n- A is incorrect: Without ER targeting and insertion, the channel cannot reach or function in the plasma membrane.\n- B is incorrect: Entry into the ER lumen requires translocation via Sec61, which fails without SRP–SR docking.\n- D is incorrect: Vesicular trafficking to the Golgi originates from the ER; without ER entry, there are no ER-derived transport vesicles carrying $Na_v$.\n- E is incorrect: Secretion requires the ER–Golgi pathway.\n\nTherefore, the fully translated but improperly processed $Na_v$ primarily accumulates in the cytoplasm as aggregates and/or substrates for degradation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2351425"}, {"introduction": "Once a protein has successfully entered the secretory pathway, it must be sorted to its correct final destination. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2351382] delves into the Golgi apparatus, the cell's primary postal service, to examine how specific molecular \"zip codes\" direct proteins. By analyzing the fate of a lysosomal enzyme that fails to receive its Mannose-6-Phosphate (M6P) tag, you will uncover the cell's default trafficking route and the importance of precise sorting signals for organelle function.", "problem": "In a newly identified neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease, neurons exhibit a progressive accumulation of specific gangliosides, leading to cellular dysfunction. Research reveals that the hydrolytic enzyme responsible for breaking down these gangliosides, which we will call \"gangliosidase-N,\" is synthesized correctly in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. However, due to a genetic mutation affecting a phosphotransferase in the cis-Golgi network, the crucial Mannose-6-Phosphate (M6P) tag cannot be added to the gangliosidase-N precursor. Assuming this enzyme enters the secretory pathway as expected, but lacks its specific sorting signal for its final destination, to which location will it be incorrectly trafficked?\n\nA. The mitochondrial matrix\n\nB. The cytosol\n\nC. The extracellular space\n\nD. The nucleoplasm\n\nE. The peroxisome", "solution": "1. State the normal pathway for lysosomal hydrolases: Lysosomal enzymes are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (via an N-terminal signal peptide that directs cotranslational translocation into the ER lumen), traverse the cis-Golgi, and in the cis-Golgi receive a Mannose-6-Phosphate (M6P) tag through the action of a phosphotransferase. This M6P tag is recognized in the trans-Golgi network by M6P receptors that package the enzymes into clathrin-coated vesicles for delivery to endosomes and then lysosomes.\n\n2. Identify the defect: A mutation in the cis-Golgi phosphotransferase prevents addition of the M6P tag to the lysosomal hydrolase precursor (here, gangliosidase-N). The enzyme is synthesized correctly and enters the secretory pathway but lacks its lysosome-targeting signal.\n\n3. Apply the sorting principle: In the absence of the M6P tag, lysosomal hydrolases are not recognized by M6P receptors in the trans-Golgi network. When a specific sorting signal is missing, proteins in the secretory pathway follow the default constitutive secretory route.\n\n4. Deduce the mislocalization: The default pathway for soluble proteins in the lumen of the ER/Golgi that lack specific retention or targeting signals is constitutive secretion to the extracellular space. This explains the classical finding in I-cell disease of high levels of multiple lysosomal hydrolases in the blood.\n\n5. Exclude other options by signal requirements and compartment access:\n- Mitochondrial matrix (A) requires an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence and post-translational import from the cytosol; proteins that have entered the ER lumen cannot be redirected to mitochondria.\n- Cytosol (B) is inaccessible once a protein has been translocated into the ER lumen; retrotranslocation would require specific quality-control pathways, not default sorting.\n- Nucleoplasm (D) requires a nuclear localization signal and import from the cytosol; again incompatible with prior ER entry.\n- Peroxisome (E) requires peroxisomal targeting signals PTS1 or PTS2 and typically import from the cytosol; ER-lumenal soluble proteins without those signals are not targeted there.\n\n6. Conclusion: Without M6P, the enzyme is mis-sorted to the constitutive secretory pathway and is secreted outside the cell, i.e., to the extracellular space.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2351382"}, {"introduction": "Protein trafficking is not merely a static delivery system; it is a highly dynamic and regulated process essential for phenomena like synaptic plasticity. This final practice problem [@problem_id:2351399] moves to the endosomal system, a critical sorting hub for receptors internalized from the cell surface. By examining the effect of a constitutively active Rab5 GTPase—a master regulator of endosome identity—you will connect the molecular machinery of vesicle sorting to the ultimate fate of neurotransmitter receptors, linking fundamental cell biology to higher-order brain function.", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating the molecular underpinnings of synaptic depression in a genetically engineered mouse model. These mice are designed to express a constitutively active mutant of the small Guanosine Triphosphatase (GTPase) Rab5 in their hippocampal neurons. This specific mutation, Rab5(Q79L), renders the protein incapable of hydrolyzing its bound Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP), thus locking it in a perpetually active state. The primary function of active Rab5 is to recruit effector proteins that mediate the tethering and homotypic fusion of early endosomes. Consequently, the neurons in this mouse model exhibit abnormally large, swollen early endosomes.\n\nThe strength of excitatory synapses, a process central to learning and memory, is heavily modulated by the number of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors present on the postsynaptic membrane. Following activity-dependent internalization via endocytosis, these receptors are delivered to early endosomes. From this sorting hub, they face one of two fates: they can be returned to the plasma membrane via tubular recycling endosomes (the recycling pathway), or they can be directed to late endosomes and subsequently lysosomes for degradation (the degradative pathway).\n\nGiven the specific cellular alteration caused by the Rab5(Q79L) mutant, what is the most probable consequence for the intracellular trafficking and ultimate fate of AMPA receptors that have undergone endocytosis in these neurons?\n\nA. The rate of AMPA receptor recycling to the postsynaptic membrane will be significantly enhanced due to the increased surface area of the enlarged endosomes.\n\nB. A larger fraction of internalized AMPA receptors will be sorted into the degradative pathway, leading to a persistent reduction in surface receptor levels.\n\nC. The ratio of recycled to degraded AMPA receptors will remain unchanged, as cellular homeostatic mechanisms will fully compensate for the altered endosome morphology.\n\nD. The initial process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis of AMPA receptors from the plasma membrane will be inhibited.\n\nE. The AMPA receptors will become permanently trapped within the enlarged early endosomes, unable to enter either the recycling or the degradative pathway.", "solution": "Rab5 is a small GTPase that, in its GTP-bound active state, recruits effectors (for example, EEA1 and class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) that promote tethering and homotypic fusion of early endosomes, generating enlarged early endosomal compartments. The Rab5(Q79L) mutant is GTPase-defective, remaining constitutively in the GTP-bound state, thereby exaggerating these effects and producing swollen early endosomes.\n\nAMPA receptors internalized from the plasma membrane enter early endosomes, which function as a sorting hub. From here, cargo is partitioned into tubular recycling carriers (Rab4/Rab11-dependent routes) that return receptors to the plasma membrane, or into the degradative pathway via formation of intralumenal vesicles and maturation toward late endosomes and lysosomes. Let $k_{\\mathrm{recycle}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{degrade}}$ denote the effective rate constants for exit from early endosomes into the recycling and degradative routes, respectively, and let $f_{\\mathrm{recycle}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{degrade}}$ denote the corresponding fate fractions, with\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{recycle}}+f_{\\mathrm{degrade}}=1,\\quad f_{\\mathrm{recycle}}=\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{recycle}}}{k_{\\mathrm{recycle}}+k_{\\mathrm{degrade}}},\\quad f_{\\mathrm{degrade}}=\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{degrade}}}{k_{\\mathrm{recycle}}+k_{\\mathrm{degrade}}}.\n$$\n\nConstitutive Rab5 activation increases early endosome homotypic fusion and residence time of cargo within early endosomes. Mechanistically, this has two key consequences for sorting:\n- It suppresses or delays the formation and function of recycling tubules (which depend on Rab4/Rab11 domains and proper endosomal domain organization), effectively decreasing $k_{\\mathrm{recycle}}$.\n- It enhances recruitment of Rab5-dependent effectors and phosphoinositide signatures that favor cargo capture into intralumenal vesicles via ESCRT machinery, thereby increasing the likelihood that cargo is committed to the degradative route, effectively increasing $k_{\\mathrm{degrade}}$.\n\nTherefore, under Rab5(Q79L), the changes $k_{\\mathrm{recycle}}\\downarrow$ and $k_{\\mathrm{degrade}}\\uparrow$ shift the fate balance so that\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{degrade}}'=\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{degrade}}'}{k_{\\mathrm{recycle}}'+k_{\\mathrm{degrade}}'}>f_{\\mathrm{degrade}}\n\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\nf_{\\mathrm{recycle}}'=\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{recycle}}'}{k_{\\mathrm{recycle}}'+k_{\\mathrm{degrade}}'}<f_{\\mathrm{recycle}}.\n$$\nThis predicts a larger fraction of internalized AMPA receptors being routed to degradation, reducing their recycling back to the surface and causing a persistent reduction in postsynaptic AMPA receptor levels and synaptic strength.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is unlikely; increased endosome size does not increase $k_{\\mathrm{recycle}}$ and typically disrupts recycling.\n- B matches the predicted shift toward degradation and decreased surface levels.\n- C is inconsistent; homeostatic mechanisms do not fully compensate for constitutive Rab5 activation.\n- D is incorrect; Rab5 acts on early endosomes downstream of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and does not inhibit the initial internalization step.\n- E is incorrect; cargo is not permanently trapped; rather, it is mis-sorted with an increased probability toward degradation.\n\nThus, the most probable consequence is an increased fraction of AMPA receptors entering the degradative pathway, leading to reduced surface receptor levels.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2351399"}]}
