By applying principles of chemical equilibrium, you will calculate the actual concentration of free G-actin available for polymerization, providing a quantitative look at how cells precisely regulate cytoskeletal assembly [@problem_id:1780470].", "problem": "In motile cells like neutrophils, the cytoskeleton must be highly dynamic to allow for rapid changes in cell shape and movement. This process is driven by the polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments. A paradox in cell biology is that the total concentration of monomeric actin (G-actin) within the cytoplasm is measured to be much higher than the critical concentration required for spontaneous polymerization in a test tube. This suggests the existence of cellular mechanisms that \"buffer\" the G-actin pool.\n\nConsider a simplified model for the G-actin pool in a neutrophil. The primary G-actin-sequestering protein is Thymosin β4. The binding of G-actin (G) to Thymosin β4 (T) is a reversible reaction that reaches equilibrium:\n$$G + T \\rightleftharpoons GT$$\nwhere GT is the sequestered, non-polymerizable G-actin-Thymosin β4 complex.\n\nAssume the total concentration of actin in the non-filamentous-and-available-for-binding pool, $[A]_{pool}$, is 100 µM. The total concentration of Thymosin β4, $[T]_{total}$, is 80 µM. The dissociation constant, $K_d$, for the reaction is 2.0 µM. Calculate the steady-state concentration of free, polymerization-competent G-actin in this model.\n\nExpress your answer in µM, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "We model the reversible binding $G + T \\rightleftharpoons GT$ with dissociation constant $K_{d} = \\frac{[G][T]}{[GT]}$.

This transport is highly directional: kinesin motors typically move cargo away from the cell body (anterograde transport), while dynein motors move it back toward the cell body (retrograde transport). This scenario challenges you to act like a cell biologist, using deductive reasoning to pinpoint the molecular cause of a specific transport defect observed in a neuron [@problem_id:2318472]. This practice reinforces the fundamental concepts of microtubule polarity and motor protein specificity.", "problem": "In a neuroscience research laboratory, a genetic screen is performed on a culture of neurons to identify mutations affecting intracellular transport. One of the isolated mutant cell lines exhibits a peculiar phenotype. In these neurons, vesicles filled with newly synthesized neurotransmitters are observed to move efficiently from the cell body down the axon to the axon terminal. However, microscopic tracking reveals that empty vesicles, which would normally be recycled, accumulate at the axon terminal and fail to return to the cell body. Assuming this defect is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in a single gene encoding a cytoskeletal-associated protein, which of the following is the most likely affected component?\n\nA. The motor protein kinesin.\n\nB. The motor protein dynein.\n\nC. The protein tubulin, which polymerizes into microtubules.\n\nD. The protein actin, which polymerizes into microfilaments.\n\nE.

Microtubules in axons are uniformly polarized with plus ends oriented distally (toward the axon terminal) and minus ends oriented proximally (toward the soma).\n- Motor specificity on microtubules is direction-dependent: kinesins are predominantly plus-end-directed motors that mediate anterograde transport (from soma to axon terminal), whereas cytoplasmic dynein is a minus-end-directed motor that mediates retrograde transport (from axon terminal to soma).\n- The observed phenotype shows efficient movement of newly synthesized vesicles from the soma to the terminal (intact anterograde transport), but failure of empty vesicles to return to the soma and accumulation at the terminal (defective retrograde transport).\n- Therefore, a specific single-gene loss-of-function explanation is a defect in the retrograde motor cytoplasmic dynein.\n- Alternative options are less consistent:\n  - Kinesin (A) mediates anterograde transport; its loss would impair movement from soma to terminal, which is normal here.\n  - Tubulin (C) defects typically disrupt microtubule integrity and thus both directions of transport, not selectively retrograde.\n  - Actin (D) microfilaments are involved in local trafficking near synapses and growth cones, not primary long-range axonal transport.\n  - Postsynaptic receptors (E) are unrelated to axonal transport in the presynaptic neuron.\n- Hence, the most likely affected component is the motor protein dynein.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2318472"}, {"introduction": "The overall efficiency of axonal transport depends not just on how fast a motor protein steps along a microtubule, but also on how long it stays attached to its track—a property known as processivity. A mutation might increase a motor's stepping rate but decrease its ability to remain attached, leading to a counterintuitive slowdown in long-range cargo delivery.

This mutation adversely affects fast axonal transport. To investigate the mechanism, researchers conduct single-molecule biophysical experiments on both the wild-type (WT) and mutant (MUT) kinesin motors.\n\nThe data can be explained by a model with the following assumptions:\n1.  The motor moves along a microtubule track with a fixed step size, $d$.\n2.  While attached, the motor's instantaneous velocity is $v_{motor} = d \\cdot k_{step}$, where $k_{step}$ is the rate-limiting stepping rate, assumed to be equal to the rate of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis under saturating ATP conditions.\n3.  The motor's processivity, defined as the average number of steps it takes before spontaneously detaching from the microtubule, is given by the ratio $P = k_{step} / k_{off}$, where $k_{off}$ is the microtubule dissociation rate.\n4.  After detaching, the motor-cargo complex is stalled and requires an average time, $\\tau_{search}$, to diffuse and re-engage with a microtubule to begin another processive run.\n5.  The long-range, or *effective velocity* ($v_{eff}$), of the cargo must incorporate both the time spent moving (the \"run phase\") and the time spent stalled (the \"search phase\").\n\nThe experimental parameters are determined as follows:\n- Step size: $d = 8.0$ nm.\n- Average search time: $\\tau_{search} = 1.5$ s.\n- Wild-type motor: $k_{step, WT} = 95 \\text{ s}^{-1}$ and $k_{off, WT} = 0.90 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n- Mutant motor: The mutation leads to a 30% increase in the stepping rate ($k_{step}$) but also causes a 12-fold increase in the dissociation rate ($k_{off}$) compared to the wild-type motor.\n\nBased on this model and data, calculate the ratio of the effective transport velocity of the mutant motor to that of the wild-type motor, $v_{eff, MUT} / v_{eff, WT}$.
