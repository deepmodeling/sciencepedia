Neurons, with their high metabolic rate and constant need for protein synthesis to maintain synaptic function, must dedicate a substantial portion of their energy budget to this task.

To assess the metabolic load on the host bacterium, you are tasked with calculating the total energy expenditure, in terms of high-energy phosphate bonds, required to synthesize a single molecule of this protein, which consists of 150 amino acids.\n\nThe synthesis process involves several steps with distinct energy requirements, provided below. For this calculation, a \"high-energy phosphate bond\" refers to a bond whose cleavage releases a significant amount of free energy, such as those in the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP or GTP to GDP.\n\nThe energy costs are as follows:\n1.  **Amino Acid Activation:** Each amino acid must be attached to its corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA). This process consumes one Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) molecule, which is hydrolyzed to Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate (PPi). The subsequent, rapid hydrolysis of PPi into two inorganic phosphate molecules means this step is energetically equivalent to the cleavage of two high-energy phosphate bonds per amino acid.\n2.  **Initiation:** The formation of the translation initiation complex, which positions the first aminoacyl-tRNA at the start codon, requires the hydrolysis of one Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) molecule to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP).\n3.  **Elongation:** For each subsequent amino acid incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain, two GTP molecules are hydrolyzed: one for the delivery of the correct aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome's A-site, and one for the translocation of the ribosome along the messenger RNA (mRNA).\n4.  **Termination:** The release of the completed polypeptide chain from the ribosome requires the hydrolysis of one GTP molecule.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the total number of high-energy phosphate bonds that are cleaved to synthesize one complete 150-amino-acid protein molecule, from the initial activation of all required amino acids to the final termination step.", "solution": "Let $n$ denote the number of amino acids in the protein.

They are particularly interested in how a specific plasticity-associated protein, which is known to be crucial for the maintenance of Long-Term Depression (LTD), is translated when global protein synthesis is suppressed. To explore this, they designed a bicistronic reporter vector. The vector has the following structure: a ubiquitous promoter drives the expression of a single messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript containing two open reading frames. The first cistron encodes the red fluorescent protein mCherry, whose translation is initiated in a standard cap-dependent manner. This is followed by an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) sequence derived from the 5' untranslated region of the plasticity-associated protein's mRNA. The second cistron, located downstream of the IRES, encodes the enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP).\n\nPrimary hippocampal neuron cultures were transfected with this vector. After allowing 48 hours for expression to reach a steady state, one group of neurons (Control) was analyzed, while another group was treated with a chemical agent that reliably induces LTD (LTD group).
