This condition can lead to cerebral edema, which is the swelling of brain tissue, posing a significant risk to neuronal function. Consider a simplified model of a single neuron surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is in equilibrium with the blood plasma. The neuron's membrane is permeable to water but effectively impermeable to the solutes that establish its internal concentration.\n\nUnder normal physiological conditions, the total concentration of dissolved particles (osmolarity) inside a typical neuron is $290 \\text{ mOsm/L}$. In this patient with hyponatremia, the osmolarity of the CSF has dropped to $265 \\text{ mOsm/L}$.

This pressure is known as the osmotic pressure difference. The relationship between osmotic pressure, concentration, and temperature is described by the van 't Hoff equation.\n\nThe osmotic pressure, $\\Pi$, of a solution is given by:\n$$ \\Pi = C_{osm} R T $$\nHere, $C_{osm}$ is the osmolarity of the solution (the molar concentration of all solute particles), $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe pressure difference, $\\Delta \\Pi$, across the neuronal membrane is the difference between the osmotic pressure of the fluid inside the neuron ($\\Pi_{intra}$) and the osmotic pressure of the fluid outside the neuron ($\\Pi_{extra}$).\n$$ \\Delta \\Pi = \\Pi_{intra} - \\Pi_{extra} $$\nA positive value of $\\Delta \\Pi$ indicates a net pressure directed outward from the inside of the cell, which drives water into the cell.\n\nUsing the van 't Hoff equation for both compartments, we can write:\n$$ \\Delta \\Pi = (C_{intra} R T) - (C_{extra} R T) $$\n$$ \\Delta \\Pi = (C_{intra} - C_{extra}) R T $$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nIntracellular osmolarity, $C_{intra} = 290 \\text{ mOsm/L}$\nExtracellular osmolarity (CSF), $C_{extra} = 265 \\text{ mOsm/L}$\nAbsolute temperature, $T = 310.15 \\text{ K}$\nIdeal gas constant, $R = 8.314 \\text{ J/(mol·K)}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the difference in osmolarity, $\\Delta C$:\n$$ \\Delta C = C_{intra} - C_{extra} = 290 \\text{ mOsm/L} - 265 \\text{ mOsm/L} = 25 \\text{ mOsm/L} $$\n\nNext, we must convert the concentration from mOsm/L to the standard SI unit of mol/m³ to be compatible with the units of the ideal gas constant $R$.\nThe unit \"osmole\" (Osm) represents one mole of solute particles.
