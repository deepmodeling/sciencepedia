This neuron has been genetically engineered to express only a single type of ion channel: a voltage-gated potassium (K$^+$) channel that activates upon depolarization but does not inactivate.

We must consider the channel gating (activation), the direction of ion flow (driving force), and the resulting electrical current.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the initial state.\nAt the holding potential of -70 mV, the neuron is relatively close to its resting state. While this potential is slightly depolarized compared to typical resting potentials, we can assume that most of the voltage-gated K$^+$ channels are in their closed conformation. Therefore, the initial K$^+$ conductance ($g_K$) is very low, and the initial current is approximately zero.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the effect of the voltage step.\nAt $t=0$, the voltage clamp forces the membrane potential ($V_m$) to change instantaneously from -70 mV to 0 mV. This change from a more negative to a less negative potential is a depolarization. The problem states that the channels are \"voltage-gated\" and \"activate upon depolarization.\" Therefore, the step to 0 mV will trigger the opening of these K$^+$ channels.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the time course of channel activation.\nThe opening of voltage-gated channels is not instantaneous. It is a stochastic process that, on a macroscopic level, results in a gradual increase in the number of open channels over a short period of time. This means that the total potassium conductance of the membrane, $g_K$, will not jump to its maximum value at $t=0$ but will increase from near zero to a maximum value over a time course characteristic of the channel's activation kinetics.\n\nStep 4: Determine the direction of ion flow.\nThe flow of ions is determined by the electrochemical driving force, which is the difference between the membrane potential ($V_m$) and the equilibrium potential for the ion ($E_K$). The ionic current ($I_K$) is given by the equation:\n$$I_K = g_K (V_m - E_K)$$\nIn this experiment, the membrane is clamped at $V_m = 0$ mV, and the equilibrium potential for K$^+$ is given as $E_K = -90$ mV.\nThe driving force is:\n$$V_m - E_K = 0 \\text{ mV} - (-90 \\text{ mV}) = +90 \\text{ mV}$$\nSince the driving force is positive, K$^+$ ions, which are positively charged, will flow out of the cell, from the region of higher potential (intracellular, relative to the Nernst potential) to the region of lower potential (extracellular). By convention in electrophysiology, an outward flow of positive charge is defined as a positive or \"outward\" current.\n\nStep 5: Synthesize the current's time course.\nCombining the previous steps, we can predict the shape of the current trace:\n- At $t=0$, just after the voltage step, the channels have not yet opened, so $g_K \\approx 0$ and thus $I_K \\approx 0$.\n- For $t  0$, the channels begin to open, causing $g_K$ to increase. Since the driving force is constant and positive, the outward current $I_K$ will increase from zero, mirroring the increase in $g_K$.\n- The problem states that the channels \"do not inactivate.\" This means that once they are open, they will remain open as long as the membrane remains depolarized at 0 mV. Consequently, the conductance $g_K$ will rise to a steady-state maximum level and stay there. The current $I_K$ will therefore also rise to a sustained, non-zero outward level and remain at that plateau for the duration of the voltage step.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. \"An instantaneous, large outward current...\" is incorrect because channel activation is a time-dependent process, not instantaneous.\n- B. \"A transient outward current that...decays back to zero...\" is incorrect because the channels are non-inactivating.\n- C. \"An inward current...\" is incorrect because the driving force causes an outward flow of K$^+$ ions.\n- D. \"A current that is initially zero, then gradually increases over time to a sustained, non-zero outward level.\" This description accurately matches our analysis: initial zero current, gradual increase due to activation, outward direction due to the driving force, and sustained level due to non-inactivation.\n- E. \"No current is observed...\" is incorrect because the depolarization from -70 mV to 0 mV is significant and will cause the voltage-gated channels to open.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that of a delayed, non-inactivating outward current.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2353971"}, {"introduction": "Beyond qualitative interpretation, voltage clamp data allows for precise quantitative analysis of membrane properties.
