Designing a successful knockout experiment requires a precise strategy, targeting the right location within a gene to ensure its protein product is no longer made. This first exercise [@problem_id:2332832] challenges you to think like a molecular biologist and select the most effective approach to disable a gene, forcing you to consider the interplay between the Cas9-induced DNA break and the cell's natural repair pathways.", "problem": "A junior researcher in a cellular neuroscience lab is tasked with investigating the specific contribution of the Nav1.7 voltage-gated sodium channel to action potential generation in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons. The protein Nav1.7 is encoded by the gene *SCN9A*. The researcher plans to use the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to functionally disable this gene.\n\nThe CRISPR-Cas9 system utilizes two main components: the Cas9 nuclease, an enzyme that cuts DNA, and a guide RNA (gRNA), which directs the Cas9 to a specific target sequence in the genome. For the widely used *Streptococcus pyogenes* Cas9, binding and cleavage require the presence of a specific sequence known as the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM), which has the sequence NGG (where N is any nucleotide), located immediately downstream of the target DNA sequence. Once Cas9 creates a double-strand break, the cell's own repair machinery is activated. One such pathway is Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), an error-prone process that often introduces small insertions or deletions at the break site.\n\nThe researcher's goal is to achieve a gene *knockout*, which means permanently inactivating the *SCN9A* gene so that it no longer produces a functional Nav1.7 protein. Which of the following strategies represents the most direct and effective molecular approach to achieve this knockout?\n\nA. Transfect the neurons with plasmids encoding the Cas9 nuclease and a gRNA designed to target a sequence within an early exon of the *SCN9A* gene, with the intention of inducing a frameshift mutation via the NHEJ pathway.\n\nB. Transfect the neurons with plasmids encoding the Cas9 nuclease and a gRNA designed to target the promoter region of the *SCN9A* gene to permanently block the binding of RNA polymerase.\n\nC. Transfect the neurons with a plasmid encoding only a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) that is complementary to the *SCN9A* messenger RNA (mRNA), aiming to trigger its degradation.\n\nD. Transfect the neurons with plasmids encoding the Cas9 nuclease, a gRNA targeting a mutated region of *SCN9A*, and a separate DNA donor template containing the wild-type *SCN9A* sequence.\n\nE. Transfect the neurons with a plasmid encoding only the Cas9 nuclease, allowing it to randomly scan the genome and cleave the *SCN9A* gene by chance.", "solution": "Goal: permanently inactivate the gene so it no longer produces a functional protein (a gene knockout). With SpCas9, the nuclease requires a PAM of the form NGG immediately downstream of the target site. Cas9 introduces a double-strand break; repair by Non-Homologous End Joining is error-prone and often creates small insertions or deletions. If these indels occur within an early coding exon, they frequently cause a frameshift, leading to premature stop codons and loss of function via truncated protein and/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. This is the standard, direct strategy for CRISPR knockout.\n\nEvaluate options:\nA. Cas9 plus a gRNA targeting an early exon to induce indels by NHEJ is the canonical approach to produce frameshift mutations that inactivate the coding sequence. This directly achieves a knockout.\nB. Targeting the promoter may create indels that alter transcription factor binding, but effects are variable and may yield partial reduction rather than complete loss; it is less direct and less reliable for a knockout than disrupting the coding sequence.\nC. An shRNA depletes mRNA post-transcriptionally, producing a knockdown, not a permanent DNA-level knockout.\nD. Providing a donor with the wild-type sequence promotes homology-directed repair that corrects mutations rather than disables the gene; this would tend to restore, not eliminate, function.\nE. Cas9 without a gRNA lacks sequence specificity and will not reliably or effectively cleave the intended locus; it is not a viable strategy.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and effective molecular approach to achieve a knockout is in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2332832"}, {"introduction": "After performing a gene editing experiment, how do you know if it worked? Verification is a critical and non-negotiable step in the scientific process. This practice [@problem_id:2332874] focuses on genotyping, a common method to confirm changes at the DNA level, by using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to amplify the targeted region. By calculating the expected size of the DNA fragments from both unedited and edited cells, you will learn how to translate a molecular event—a deletion—into a concrete, measurable result on a gel.", "problem": "A cellular neuroscientist is studying the gene *Synap-1*, which codes for a protein crucial for synaptic vesicle docking. To investigate its function, they employ the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to induce a precise deletion within a key exon of the *Synap-1* gene in a line of cultured neuronal progenitor cells. The intended deletion is exactly 480 base pairs (bp) in length.\n\nAfter the gene editing procedure, the scientist needs to verify if the deletion was successful. They isolate genomic DNA from the cell culture and design a pair of primers for a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis. The primers are designed to flank the targeted deletion site. The forward primer hybridizes to a region such that its 3' end is 175 bp upstream of the 5' boundary of the targeted deletion. The reverse primer hybridizes to a region such that its 3' end is 235 bp downstream of the 3' boundary of the targeted deletion.\n\nCalculate the expected size of the PCR product (amplicon) for the unmodified (wild-type) allele and the successfully edited (deletion) allele. Express your answer as two integer values in base pairs (bp).

Let the distance from the forward primer 3' end to the 5' boundary of the deletion be $u=175$ bp, and the distance from the 3' boundary of the deletion to the reverse primer 3' end be $v=235$ bp.\n\nBy PCR amplification principles, the defined-length amplicon generated after sufficient cycles spans the genomic segment between the primers’ 3' ends. Therefore:\n- For the unmodified (wild-type) allele, the product includes the upstream segment, the intact region that would be deleted, and the downstream segment. Thus,\n$$L_{\\text{WT}}=u+d+v.$$\n- For the successfully edited (deletion) allele, the $d$-bp region is absent, so the amplicon comprises only the upstream and downstream segments.

Neuroscientists often need to manipulate genes only in specific brain cells or at certain life stages to untangle complex biological questions. This final challenge [@problem_id:2332861] asks you to design a conditional knock-in mouse model, integrating CRISPR-Cas9 with the Cre-LoxP system for precise spatiotemporal control, a technique at the forefront of modern neuroscience research.", "problem": "A team of neuroscientists is investigating a novel mutation in a synaptic protein, which they have named *Synaptostatin*, that is hypothesized to cause adult-onset motor deficits. To test this hypothesis, they aim to create a genetically engineered mouse model. The experimental design requires that the mutant form of the *Synaptostatin* protein be expressed exclusively in cerebellar Purkinje cells, and only after the mice have reached adulthood, with the onset of expression triggered by the administration of the drug tamoxifen.\n\nThe researchers have the following molecular tools at their disposal:\n- **Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system**: For precise gene editing and insertion.\n- **Cre-LoxP system**: A powerful tool for conditional gene manipulation.\n- **Pcp2 promoter**: A DNA sequence that drives gene expression specifically in cerebellar Purkinje cells.\n- **CAG promoter**: A strong, ubiquitously active synthetic promoter.\n- **Cre-ERt2 fusion protein**: A version of Cre recombinase that remains inactive in the cytoplasm until it binds to tamoxifen, which allows it to translocate to the nucleus and perform its function.\n- **Lox-Stop-Lox (LSL) cassette**: A transcriptional termination signal flanked by two loxP recombination sites. When inserted between a promoter and a gene, it prevents the gene's expression until a Cre recombinase excises the cassette.\n- **ROSA26 locus**: A well-characterized \"safe harbor\" site in the mouse genome that allows for stable transgene expression without disrupting endogenous gene function.\n- **cDNA for mutant *Synaptostatin* (*mSyn*)**: The coding sequence for the mutant protein.\n\nWhich of the following strategies correctly describes the most effective and precise method to generate the desired mouse model?\n\nA. Create two separate mouse lines and cross them. Line 1 is generated to express Cre-ERt2 under the control of the Pcp2 promoter. Line 2 is generated using CRISPR-Cas9 to insert a cassette containing the CAG promoter, followed by an LSL cassette, followed by the *mSyn* cDNA, into the ROSA26 locus (`ROSA26::CAG-LSL-mSyn`).\n\nB. Use CRISPR-Cas9 to create a single mouse line where the endogenous *Synaptostatin* gene is directly replaced by the *mSyn* cDNA. Then, treat these mice with tamoxifen as adults to induce the motor deficits.\n\nC. Create two separate mouse lines and cross them. Line 1 is generated to express Cre-ERt2 under the control of the ubiquitous CAG promoter. Line 2 is generated via CRISPR-Cas9 to have the `ROSA26::Pcp2-LSL-mSyn` cassette.\n\nD. Create two separate mouse lines and cross them. Line 1 is generated to express a standard Cre recombinase (not the Cre-ERt2 variant) under the control of the Pcp2 promoter. Line 2 is a `ROSA26::CAG-LSL-mSyn` mouse.\n\nE. Use CRISPR-Cas9 to generate a single, complex mouse line by inserting a `Pcp2-LSL-mSyn` cassette into the ROSA26 locus. These mice are then treated with tamoxifen to induce expression.", "solution": "Goal: Express the mutant Synaptostatin protein only in cerebellar Purkinje cells, only in adulthood, and only upon tamoxifen administration.\n\nDesign constraints and principles:\n- Cell-type specificity is achieved by restricting Cre activity or promoter activity to Purkinje cells. The Pcp2 promoter drives expression specifically in Purkinje cells, so placing Cre under Pcp2 ensures Cre is present only in Purkinje cells.\n- Temporal control by tamoxifen requires Cre-ERt2, which remains cytoplasmic and inactive until tamoxifen binding causes nuclear translocation and recombinase activity.\n- Conditional activation of the transgene uses an LSL cassette placed between a promoter and the coding sequence; Cre excision removes the stop, enabling downstream expression.\n- Robust expression after activation is commonly achieved using a strong, ubiquitous promoter such as CAG. Placing the transgene under CAG after LSL ensures high expression once the stop is excised.\n- Targeting the ROSA26 locus via CRISPR-Cas9 provides a safe harbor site for stable, predictable expression without disrupting endogenous genes.\n\nEvaluate each option against these requirements:\n\nOption A: Two lines crossed. Line 1: Pcp2-driven Cre-ERt2 (Purkinje-specific, tamoxifen-inducible recombinase). Line 2: ROSA26::CAG-LSL-mSyn (safe harbor insertion; expression blocked by LSL until Cre excision; strong CAG drives expression after excision). Upon tamoxifen administration in adults, Cre-ERt2 becomes active only in Purkinje cells, excises LSL, and enables CAG-driven mSyn expression exclusively in those cells, at the chosen time. This satisfies cell specificity, temporal control, and precise genomic insertion with robust expression.\n\nOption B: Replace endogenous Synaptostatin with mSyn cDNA using CRISPR-Cas9. There is no Cre system here, so tamoxifen has no mechanism to control expression. Expression would follow the endogenous gene’s spatiotemporal pattern, failing both Purkinje-cell exclusivity and adult inducibility.\n\nOption C: Two lines crossed. Line 1: CAG-driven Cre-ERt2 (ubiquitous, tamoxifen-inducible recombinase). Line 2: ROSA26::Pcp2-LSL-mSyn. Upon tamoxifen, Cre-ERt2 is activated in all cells, excising LSL ubiquitously. Although expression still requires Pcp2 promoter activity and would be largely Purkinje-specific, recombination would occur genome-wide, permanently altering the reporter locus in all cells and potentially recombining other floxed alleles. This is less precise and introduces unnecessary off-target recombination risk compared to restricting Cre-ERt2 to Purkinje cells. Moreover, Pcp2 promoter within a ROSA26 knock-in may not match native regulation as reliably as using a strong post-excision promoter like CAG.\n\nOption D: Pcp2-driven standard Cre crossed to ROSA26::CAG-LSL-mSyn. This lacks tamoxifen-inducible control; recombination will occur during development whenever Pcp2 is active, failing the adult-onset requirement.\n\nOption E: ROSA26::Pcp2-LSL-mSyn with tamoxifen treatment. Without any Cre recombinase present, tamoxifen cannot induce expression. This fails to meet the inducibility requirement.\n\nConclusion: Option A uniquely and optimally meets all requirements: Purkinje-cell specificity via Pcp2-Cre-ERt2, adult-onset induction with tamoxifen, robust expression via CAG after LSL excision, and precise insertion at ROSA26 using CRISPR-Cas9.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2332861"}]}
