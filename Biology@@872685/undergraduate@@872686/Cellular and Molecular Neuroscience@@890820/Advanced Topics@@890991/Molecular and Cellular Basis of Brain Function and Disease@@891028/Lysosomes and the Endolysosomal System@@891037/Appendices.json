This exercise explores the critical process of protein sorting by asking you to consider the fate of a lysosomal enzyme that lacks its specific delivery tag, the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) signal. By working through this scenario [@problem_id:2341504], you will reinforce your understanding of the Golgi apparatus's role as a central sorting station and the consequences of sorting signal failure.", "problem": "In a healthy neuron, soluble enzymes destined for the lysosome, such as hydrolases, are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently transported to the Golgi apparatus. Within the Golgi, they are tagged with a specific molecular marker, Mannose-6-Phosphate (M6P), which acts as a sorting signal. This M6P tag is recognized by M6P receptors in the trans-Golgi network, ensuring the enzymes are packaged into vesicles that deliver them to the lysosome.\n\nConsider a specific lysosomal enzyme, \"Neurolysine,\" that is critical for breaking down waste products in a neuron. A rare genetic mutation affects the gene for Neurolysine. This mutation does not alter the enzyme's stability, folding, or catalytic function, but it modifies a key recognition site on the protein. As a result, the enzymes responsible for adding the M6P tag in the Golgi apparatus fail to recognize Neurolysine, and it is therefore not tagged with M6P. All other cellular components and trafficking pathways are functioning correctly.\n\nGiven that this untagged but otherwise functional Neurolysine protein is successfully synthesized and enters the secretory pathway, what is its primary long-term fate?\n\nA. It will be released from the Golgi apparatus into the cytosol to be degraded by the proteasome.\n\nB. It will be transported back to the endoplasmic reticulum for refolding.\n\nC. It will be retained and will accumulate within the lumen of the Golgi apparatus.\n\nD. It will be packaged into secretory vesicles and released into the extracellular space.\n\nE. It will be incorrectly sorted and delivered to the mitochondrial matrix.", "solution": "The trafficking of soluble lysosomal enzymes relies on signal-dependent sorting in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The key principles are:\n1) Soluble lysosomal hydrolases are synthesized into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen and move anterogradely through the Golgi as luminal cargo.\n2) In the cis-Golgi, a phosphotransferase recognizes specific protein determinants on hydrolases and adds mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) to their N-linked oligosaccharides; this M6P serves as a sorting signal.\n3) In the TGN, M6P receptors bind M6P-tagged enzymes and package them into clathrin-coated vesicles destined for endosomes and lysosomes.\n4) In the absence of the M6P signal, the default pathway for soluble luminal cargo in the secretory pathway is constitutive secretion to the plasma membrane and release into the extracellular space, unless an alternative retention or retrieval signal is present.\n\nApply these principles to the mutant Neurolysine:\n- The mutation does not impair folding or catalytic activity and does not cause ER quality control or ER-associated degradation. The protein enters the ER lumen and progresses to the Golgi as normal.\n- The mutation disrupts the recognition site required by the M6P-adding enzymes; therefore, Neurolysine lacks the M6P tag and cannot be captured by M6P receptors in the TGN.\n- Without M6P-dependent capture, Neurolysine will not be sorted into lysosome-directed vesicles. In the absence of other specific retention/retrieval signals, soluble cargo follows the default constitutive secretory route to the plasma membrane and is released extracellularly.\n\nExclude the alternatives:\n- Option A (release into the cytosol for proteasomal degradation) is incompatible with topology; a luminal protein does not cross back into the cytosol from the Golgi, and proteasomal degradation targets cytosolic or retrotranslocated ERAD substrates, which is not triggered here because the protein is properly folded.\n- Option B (retrograde transport to the ER) requires a retrieval signal such as KDEL for soluble ER-resident proteins; lysosomal enzymes do not carry KDEL, and no such retrieval is specified.\n- Option C (retention in the Golgi lumen) would require Golgi retention signals or cycling receptors; there is no such signal in lysosomal hydrolases, and the absence of M6P does not create Golgi retention.\n- Option E (mitochondrial delivery) is impossible from the secretory pathway; mitochondrial import uses N-terminal presequences recognized in the cytosol and TOM/TIM complexes, and luminal secretory proteins do not access this route.\n\nAdditional note: Some M6P receptors at the plasma membrane can recapture M6P-tagged enzymes via endocytosis; however, this mutant lacks M6P and will not be efficiently recaptured, reinforcing extracellular accumulation as the long-term fate.\n\nThus, the primary long-term fate of the untagged but functional Neurolysine is secretion into the extracellular space.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2341504"}, {"introduction": "The endolysosomal system functions as a highly organized and dynamic pathway for processing materials brought into the cell. This problem challenges you to trace the journey of an important signaling molecule, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), from the cell surface to its final destination. By predicting the outcome when a key fusion event is blocked [@problem_id:2341540], you will solidify your knowledge of the sequential steps involved in endocytic trafficking and degradation.", "problem": "A developmental neurobiologist is investigating the cellular mechanisms of protein trafficking in cultured hippocampal neurons. They are using a newly synthesized drug, \"Fusoblock-7,\" which has been shown to have a single, highly specific effect: it completely inhibits the fusion of late endosomes with lysosomes. The drug does not affect endocytosis, the maturation of early endosomes into late endosomes, the enzymatic activity of acid hydrolases within lysosomes, or the process of autophagy.\n\nTo study the drug's effect, the neurons are first pre-treated with Fusoblock-7 for one hour. Then, the culture medium is supplemented with a high concentration of fluorescently-tagged Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). In neurons, the BDNF-receptor complex is internalized via endocytosis and is normally trafficked through the endolysosomal system for eventual degradation, which serves to terminate its signaling.\n\nAfter several hours of incubation with both Fusoblock-7 and fluorescent BDNF, what is the most likely observation a researcher would make regarding the location of the fluorescent signal within the treated neurons?\n\nA. The fluorescent BDNF will accumulate within enlarged late endosomes.\n\nB. The fluorescent BDNF will be efficiently degraded, and its signal will be absent, similar to control neurons without the drug.\n\nC. The fluorescent BDNF will be sequestered within early endosomes located just beneath the cell membrane.\n\nD. The fluorescent BDNF will accumulate within lysosomes, which are unable to degrade it.\n\nE. The fluorescent BDNF will be re-routed to the Golgi apparatus for reprocessing.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the subcellular location of a fluorescently-tagged protein, BDNF, in neurons treated with a drug that blocks the fusion of late endosomes and lysosomes. To solve this, we must trace the normal trafficking pathway of a molecule destined for degradation and then determine where this pathway is interrupted by the drug.\n\nStep 1: Understand the normal endolysosomal degradative pathway.\nWhen Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) binds to its receptor on the neuron's surface, the receptor-ligand complex is internalized into the cell via a process called receptor-mediated endocytosis. This forms a small vesicle. This vesicle sheds its coat and fuses with an early endosome, which is a sorting station located near the cell periphery. From the early endosome, cargo destined for degradation is sorted into a pathway that leads to the maturation of the early endosome into a late endosome, sometimes also called a multivesicular body. This maturation process involves changes in protein and lipid composition and a drop in the internal pH. The late endosome then moves deeper into the cell. The final step in the degradation pathway is the fusion of the late endosome with a lysosome. Lysosomes are organelles filled with a variety of acid hydrolases, which are digestive enzymes that function optimally in a highly acidic environment (pH ~4.5-5.0). Upon fusion, the contents of the late endosome, including the BDNF, are exposed to these enzymes and are broken down.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the effect of the drug \"Fusoblock-7\".\nThe problem states that Fusoblock-7 specifically and completely inhibits the fusion of late endosomes with lysosomes. All other steps in the pathway (endocytosis, trafficking to early endosomes, and maturation to late endosomes) are said to be unaffected.\n\nStep 3: Trace the path of fluorescent BDNF in the presence of Fusoblock-7.\nFollowing the pathway described in Step 1:\n- The fluorescent BDNF will be internalized via endocytosis. This step is normal.\n- The resulting vesicles will fuse with early endosomes. This step is normal.\n- The early endosomes containing the fluorescent BDNF will mature into late endosomes. This step is normal.\n- At this point, the fluorescent BDNF is contained within late endosomes.\n- The next step, the fusion of these late endosomes with lysosomes, is blocked by Fusoblock-7.\n\nStep 4: Determine the consequence of the block.\nSince the late endosomes cannot fuse with lysosomes, they cannot deliver their cargo (the fluorescent BDNF) for degradation. As the cell continues to internalize more fluorescent BDNF, this cargo will continue to travel down the pathway until it reaches the point of the block. Therefore, fluorescent BDNF will accumulate in the compartment immediately preceding the blocked step, which is the late endosome. Because cargo is continuously arriving in these late endosomes but cannot exit, the compartments will swell and become enlarged due to the accumulation.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. The fluorescent BDNF will accumulate within enlarged late endosomes. This matches our reasoning perfectly. F-BDNF reaches the late endosome, but cannot proceed to the lysosome, causing it to accumulate and the late endosome to swell. This is the correct answer.\n- B. The fluorescent BDNF will be efficiently degraded, and its signal will be absent. This is incorrect. The final, critical step of degradation requires fusion with the lysosome, which is blocked.\n- C. The fluorescent BDNF will be sequestered within early endosomes. This is incorrect. The drug does not affect the maturation of early endosomes into late endosomes, so the cargo would not be trapped at the early endosome stage.\n- D. The fluorescent BDNF will accumulate within lysosomes. This is incorrect. The very mechanism of the drug prevents the BDNF, which is in late endosomes, from ever reaching the lysosomes.\n- E. The fluorescent BDNF will be re-routed to the Golgi apparatus for reprocessing. This is incorrect. The endolysosomal pathway for degradation is distinct from the retrograde pathway that traffics materials from endosomes to the Golgi.
