{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To study autophagy, scientists need reliable molecular flags that signal the process is underway. This exercise introduces one of the most widely used markers, the LC3 protein, and a standard technique to measure its activity. By exploring how a specific drug, rapamycin, influences the molecular signature of LC3, you will practice connecting a signaling pathway regulator (mTOR) to a direct experimental readout, a fundamental skill in cellular neuroscience [@problem_id:2327576].", "problem": "A neurobiology researcher is investigating the process of autophagy in primary cortical neurons cultured in vitro. Autophagy is a crucial cellular recycling pathway that is tightly regulated. A key regulator of this pathway is the protein kinase known as the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), which typically acts to suppress autophagy when nutrients are plentiful. The researcher decides to treat one group of neurons with rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR. To monitor the autophagic activity, the researcher plans to perform a Western blot analysis to measure the levels of Microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3). In the cell, LC3 exists in a cytosolic form, LC3-I. Upon the initiation of autophagy, LC3-I is lipidated to form LC3-II, which is then incorporated into the membrane of the forming autophagosome. The ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I is a widely used indicator of autophagic activity.\n\nBased on the known molecular mechanism of rapamycin and its effect on autophagy, which of the following outcomes would be the most expected result for the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I in the rapamycin-treated neurons compared to an untreated control group?\n\nA. The ratio will significantly increase.\n\nB. The ratio will significantly decrease.\n\nC. The ratio will remain unchanged.\n\nD. Both LC3-I and LC3-II will be completely degraded and undetectable.\n\nE. The ratio will become highly variable and therefore inconclusive.", "solution": "Autophagy is negatively regulated by mTORC1 under nutrient-replete conditions because active mTORC1 phosphorylates and inhibits the ULK1 initiation complex, thereby suppressing autophagosome formation. Rapamycin specifically inhibits mTORC1, relieving this inhibition. Therefore, in rapamycin-treated neurons, the ULK1 complex becomes active, initiating autophagy.\n\nDuring autophagy initiation, cytosolic LC3-I is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine through the ATG7/ATG3 conjugation system, converting LC3-I to LC3-II. LC3-II incorporates into autophagosomal membranes. Consequently, autophagy induction typically increases LC3-II abundance relative to LC3-I, which is reflected as an increase in the ratio $ \\frac{\\text{LC3-II}}{\\text{LC3-I}} $ on Western blot.\n\nTherefore, compared to untreated control neurons, rapamycin-treated neurons are expected to show an increased $ \\frac{\\text{LC3-II}}{\\text{LC3-I}} $ ratio. While rigorous assessment of autophagic flux ideally includes lysosomal inhibitors (e.g., bafilomycin A1) and additional markers (e.g., p62/SQSTM1), the most expected directional change with rapamycin alone is an increase in $ \\frac{\\text{LC3-II}}{\\text{LC3-I}} $.\n\nThis reasoning rules out the alternatives: a decrease would indicate suppressed autophagy (contrary to mTOR inhibition), no change would imply no effect of rapamycin, complete degradation is biologically implausible under standard conditions, and a highly variable/inconclusive ratio is not the expected systematic outcome of a specific mTORC1 inhibitor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2327576"}, {"introduction": "Observing a change in a biological system is the first step, but interpreting that change correctly is the essence of science. This practice challenges you to think like an experimentalist by considering a common scenario: an accumulation of autophagosomes. As you will discover, this observation is not as straightforward as it seems and requires a deeper understanding of 'autophagic flux'—the dynamic flow of the entire pathway—to avoid common pitfalls in data interpretation [@problem_id:2327587].", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating the cellular effects of a novel compound, \"Neurotoxin X,\" on cultured hippocampal neurons. The primary degradation pathway for bulk cytoplasmic contents and damaged organelles in neurons is autophagy. This process involves the formation of double-membraned vesicles called autophagosomes, which sequester cellular material. These autophagosomes then fuse with lysosomes, forming autolysosomes, where the contents are degraded by acidic hydrolases.\n\nUsing fluorescence microscopy with a marker protein that specifically labels autophagosomes, the scientist observes a statistically significant increase in the number of fluorescent autophagosome puncta within the neurons treated with Neurotoxin X compared to untreated control neurons. Based *only* on this observation, which of the following is the most accurate and cautious interpretation of the data?\n\nA. The overall rate of cellular degradation via autophagy has increased, as Neurotoxin X stimulates the rapid formation of autophagosomes to clear cellular debris.\n\nB. Neurotoxin X may be impairing the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, leading to an accumulation of autophagosomes that cannot be cleared.\n\nC. The neurotoxin is causing lysosomes to fragment and reassemble into autophagosomes, which accounts for the observed increase in the latter.\n\nD. The rate of autophagy has been downregulated to conserve cellular energy, and the observed autophagosomes are stable, inert structures that are no longer part of an active degradation process.\n\nE. Neurotoxin X directly inhibits the function of lysosomes, causing them to swell and be mistakenly identified as large autophagosomes by the fluorescent marker.", "solution": "The observation is an increased number of fluorescent puncta labeled by an autophagosome-specific marker after treatment with Neurotoxin X. In autophagy, autophagosomes are formed and then fuse with lysosomes to generate autolysosomes where cargo is degraded. An increased steady-state number of autophagosomes can arise from two non-exclusive scenarios: increased autophagosome biogenesis (induction) or impaired downstream clearance (blocked fusion with lysosomes or defective lysosomal degradation). Without an autophagic flux assay (e.g., measuring LC3 turnover in the presence and absence of lysosomal inhibitors, or quantifying autolysosomes versus autophagosomes), one cannot conclude that overall degradative autophagy has increased.\n\nOption A asserts increased degradation and rapid formation, which cannot be inferred from puncta number alone because accumulation could reflect a traffic jam rather than enhanced flux. Option B cautiously proposes that Neurotoxin X may impair autophagosome–lysosome fusion, leading to accumulation—a well-recognized explanation for increased autophagosome number and appropriately hedged by “may.” Option C is biologically incorrect because lysosomes do not fragment and reassemble into autophagosomes; autophagosomes originate from phagophore membranes. Option D claims autophagy is downregulated and autophagosomes are inert, which is unsupported by the data and contradicts the dynamic nature of these structures. Option E is unlikely because the marker specifically labels autophagosomes; misidentification of lysosomes as autophagosomes would not be expected with a specific autophagosome marker.\n\nTherefore, based only on the observed increase in autophagosome puncta, the most accurate and cautious interpretation is that Neurotoxin X may be impairing autophagosome clearance, such as by inhibiting fusion with lysosomes, leading to accumulation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2327587"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond static snapshots, modern cell biology uses clever tools to visualize dynamic processes in real time.

The neurons are genetically engineered to express a tandem fluorescent reporter protein, mCherry-EGFP-LC3. The LC3 protein is incorporated into the membranes of autophagosomes as they form. The reporter consists of two fluorescent proteins: mCherry, which is red and pH-stable, and Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP), which is green but its fluorescence is quenched in acidic environments ($pH  6.0$). Consequently, newly formed autophagosomes (neutral pH) fluoresce both green and red (appearing yellow), whereas autolysosomes (which are acidic after fusion with lysosomes) fluoresce only red.\n\nThe experiment proceeds in two stages.\nFirst, at time $t=0$, the autophagy-inducing drug rapamycin is added to the culture.

However, it does not affect the rapamycin-stimulated rate of new autophagosome formation, which remains constant at $R'_{f} = 120$ new autophagosomes per minute. It also does not affect the degradation of existing autolysosomes, which proceeds via first-order kinetics with a half-life of $t_{1/2,AL} = 7.0$ minutes.\n\nAssume that each autophagosome contributes exactly one unit of green fluorescence and one unit of red fluorescence.
