For modeling purposes, the dendritic segment of interest is approximated as a perfect cylinder with a length $L$ and a radius $r$. The formation of excitatory synapses on this dendrite is critically dependent on a transmembrane protein, which we'll call \"Synapsin-X\". Experimental data suggests a direct proportionality between the density of synapses (number of synapses per unit area) and the surface concentration of Synapsin-X (number of protein molecules per unit area).\n\nInitially, the dendritic segment has a uniform Synapsin-X surface concentration of $C_0$. The proportionality constant relating synaptic density, $\\sigma$, to the Synapsin-X concentration, $C$, is given by $k$, such that $\\sigma = kC$. The neuroscientist then employs a viral vector to genetically modify the neuron, causing it to overexpress Synapsin-X. This modification leads to a specific, uniform increase in the surface concentration of Synapsin-X by a factor of $\\alpha$ over the entire segment, meaning the new concentration is $C_f = \\alpha C_0$.

The survival of a dendritic spine is governed by the local concentration of a neurotrophic signal.\n\nThe model posits two rules:\n1.  The average concentration of the neurotrophic signal, $C$, at a synapse is directly proportional to the average firing rate, $f$, of the presynaptic axon innervating that spine. The governing equation is $C = \\alpha f$, where $\\alpha$ is a constant.\n2.  A dendritic spine is stable and will be maintained only if the neurotrophic signal concentration $C$ at its location is at or above a critical threshold, $C_{\\text{thresh}}$.

Population A consists of $N_A = 3000$ neurons, and Population B consists of $N_B = 400$ neurons.\n\nThe formation of synapses is governed by the molecular interaction between Neurexin (Nrxn) on presynaptic terminals and Neuroligin (Nlgn) on postsynaptic densities. Specifically, all neurons in Population A express Neurexin-1$\\beta$ (Nrxn1$\\beta$), but they are divided into two genetically distinct subpopulations based on a key alternative splicing event at splice site 4 (SS4). A fraction $f_{A+} = 0.75$ of Population A neurons expresses the splice variant Nrxn1$\\beta$(SS4+), while the remaining neurons express Nrxn1$\\beta$(SS4-). All neurons in Population B express Neuroligin-1 (Nlgn1).\n\nBiochemical studies have established that the Nrxn1$\\beta$(SS4-) variant binds to Nlgn1 with high affinity, leading to the formation of 'high-stability' potential synapses. In contrast, the Nrxn1$\\beta$(SS4+) variant binds to Nlgn1 with significantly lower affinity, forming 'low-stability' potential synapses.\n\nInitially, exuberant connections are made, where every neuron from Population A forms a potential synapse with every neuron in Population B. Following this, a process of competitive synapse elimination occurs. This refinement is governed by a postsynaptic capacity limit: each neuron in Population B can only maintain a maximum of $K = 900$ stable synapses from Population A. The stabilization process is strictly competitive based on stability. For each postsynaptic neuron, high-stability potential synapses are always selected for maintenance over low-stability ones. If the number of available high-stability inputs is less than $K$, all are maintained, and the remaining slots are filled by randomly selecting from the available low-stability inputs.\n\nAssuming this process goes to completion, calculate the total number of stable synapses that are ultimately formed by the subpopulation of neurons expressing Nrxn1$\\beta$(SS4+).
