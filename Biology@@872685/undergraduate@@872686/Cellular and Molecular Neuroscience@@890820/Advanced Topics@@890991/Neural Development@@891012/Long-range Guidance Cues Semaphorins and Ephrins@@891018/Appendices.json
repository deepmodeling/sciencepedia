{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The brain's wiring is a masterpiece of precision, not a random tangle. One of its most elegant features is the 'topographic map,' where spatial relationships from a sensory surface are preserved in the target brain region. This exercise explores the fundamental mechanism behind this mapping, using the Eph/Ephrin system as a classic example. By working through this hypothetical scenario [@problem_id:2341138], you will apply the principle of contact-repulsion to predict how varying receptor densities on an axon determine its final destination along a gradient of repulsive molecular cues.", "problem": "In a developing vertebrate nervous system, sensory neurons from a specific ganglion project to a target nucleus in the brainstem. The establishment of this connection is guided by molecular cues. The target nucleus exhibits a smooth, linear gradient of a guidance molecule called Ephrin-A, with the highest concentration at its rostral (front) end and the lowest concentration at its caudal (rear) end. The incoming sensory axons express a receptor for this molecule, known as the EphA receptor. Different neurons in the ganglion express different densities of EphA receptors on their growth cones. The interaction between EphA receptors and Ephrin-A ligands is a primary determinant of where an axon terminates.\n\nConsider a specific subset of these sensory neurons that expresses a very high density of EphA receptors on their axons. Based on the principles of contact-repulsion guidance mediated by the Eph/Ephrin system, where are these specific axons most likely to form their stable terminal connections within the target nucleus?\n\nA. In the caudal region of the nucleus, where the concentration of Ephrin-A is lowest.\n\nB. In the rostral region of the nucleus, where the concentration of Ephrin-A is highest.\n\nC. Distributed randomly throughout the nucleus, showing no preference for any specific region.\n\nD. In the exact center of the nucleus, where the Ephrin-A concentration is at an intermediate level.\n\nE. These axons will be entirely repelled and will fail to enter the target nucleus.", "solution": "We model the target nucleus along a one-dimensional rostral-to-caudal axis with coordinate $x$, taking $x=0$ as rostral and $x=L$ as caudal. The Ephrin-A ligand concentration is given as a smooth linear gradient, highest rostrally and lowest caudally. A convenient linear form consistent with this is\n$$\nL(x)=L_{0}-\\beta x,\n$$\nwith $L_{0}>0$ and $\\beta>0$, so $L(0)=L_{0}$ is maximal rostrally and $L(x)$ decreases monotonically toward caudal positions.\n\nLet $R$ denote the EphA receptor density on the growth cone of a given axon. Contact-mediated repulsion in the Eph/Ephrin system can be represented by a repulsive signaling strength\n$$\nS(x)=\\alpha R\\,L(x),\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha>0$ is a coupling constant converting receptor-ligand engagement into intracellular repulsive signaling. A standard guidance principle is that axons terminate where this repulsive signal reaches a characteristic set-point (or threshold) for stable termination; denote this threshold by $S^{\\dagger}>0$. Thus the termination position $x^{*}$ satisfies\n$$\nS(x^{*})=\\alpha R\\,L(x^{*})=S^{\\dagger}.\n$$\nSubstituting $L(x)=L_{0}-\\beta x$ gives\n$$\n\\alpha R\\left(L_{0}-\\beta x^{*}\\right)=S^{\\dagger}\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad x^{*}=\\frac{L_{0}}{\\beta}-\\frac{S^{\\dagger}}{\\alpha\\beta}\\frac{1}{R}.\n$$\nFrom this explicit solution, the dependence on receptor density $R$ is monotonic:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x^{*}}{\\partial R}=\\frac{S^{\\dagger}}{\\alpha\\beta}\\frac{1}{R^{2}}>0.\n$$\nTherefore, as $R$ increases (very high EphA receptor density), $x^{*}$ also increases. Since larger $x$ are more caudal, high-$R$ axons terminate more caudally, where $L(x)$ is low. Intuitively, axons with a high receptor density are highly sensitive to the repulsive ligand. They will be repelled by even low concentrations of Ephrin-A and will therefore be forced to terminate at the very edge of the target field where the ligand concentration is at its minimum. In this problem, the lowest concentration is at the caudal end.\n\nConsequently, sensory axons expressing very high densities of EphA receptors will form stable terminal connections in the caudal region of the target nucleus, where Ephrin-A concentration is lowest. This corresponds to option A. The alternatives are inconsistent with the repulsive threshold logic: B would fit low $R$, not high; C contradicts cue-dependent guidance; D corresponds to intermediate $R$; E is an extreme outcome not specified for axons that successfully map within the target.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2341138"}, {"introduction": "While molecular gradients provide the 'address' for a navigating axon, the axon must have the correct 'antenna' to read it. Axon guidance signaling is rarely a simple one-to-one interaction; it often requires intricate multi-protein complexes to function. This problem [@problem_id:2341141] challenges you to dissect the canonical receptor complex for Semaphorin 3A, a powerful repulsive cue. By considering a neuron that lacks the essential co-receptor Neuropilin-1, you will clarify the specific and non-interchangeable roles of each component in transducing a guidance signal.", "problem": "During the development of the nervous system, the growth cones of extending axons are guided to their correct targets by molecular cues. Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) is a secreted, long-range chemorepulsive cue, meaning it causes growth cones to turn away from its source. The canonical signaling pathway for Sema3A requires a receptor complex on the growth cone membrane. Sema3A first binds to a co-receptor, Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1). This Sema3A-Nrp1 complex then recruits and binds to the PlexinA1 protein, which is the primary signal-transducing component. The full assembly of the Sema3A-Nrp1-PlexinA1 complex is necessary to trigger the intracellular signaling cascade that leads to cytoskeletal rearrangement and growth cone collapse, resulting in repulsion.\n\nConsider a specific population of developing neurons that has been genetically engineered. These neurons express functional PlexinA1 receptors but completely lack the gene for Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1). If a growth cone from one of these modified neurons is exposed to a stable gradient of Sema3A, with the highest concentration on one side, which of the following outcomes is the most likely?\n\nA. The growth cone will be strongly repelled and turn away from the high-concentration side of the Sema3A gradient.\n\nB. The growth cone will be strongly attracted and turn towards the high-concentration side of the Sema3A gradient.\n\nC. The growth cone's direction of growth will be unaffected by the Sema3A gradient.\n\nD. The growth cone will collapse, and the axon will immediately cease all further extension.\n\nE. The neuron will upregulate the expression of a different co-receptor, such as Neuropilin-2, and be repelled after a delay.", "solution": "1. State the canonical signaling requirement: For Sema3A to elicit chemorepulsion, the ligand first binds Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) on the growth cone membrane. The Sema3A–Nrp1 complex then recruits PlexinA1, which serves as the primary signal-transducing receptor. Full assembly of the Sema3A–Nrp1–PlexinA1 complex is required to initiate intracellular signaling that causes cytoskeletal rearrangement and growth cone collapse leading to repulsion.\n\n2. Identify the genetic manipulation: The engineered neurons express functional PlexinA1 but completely lack the gene for Nrp1, and therefore cannot express Nrp1 protein.\n\n3. Assess the ability to form the necessary receptor complex: Without Nrp1, Sema3A cannot form the Sema3A–Nrp1 complex and thus cannot recruit PlexinA1 into the functional signaling complex. PlexinA1 alone is insufficient to bind Sema3A in this canonical class 3 semaphorin pathway.\n\n4. Infer signaling outcome: In the absence of the full receptor complex, Sema3A cannot trigger the downstream intracellular signaling cascade. Therefore, the growth cone will not transduce the chemorepulsive signal.\n\n5. Evaluate alternatives and exclude them:\n- Strong repulsion (A) requires intact Sema3A–Nrp1–PlexinA1 signaling, which is absent; thus A is not expected.\n- Attraction (B) would require an alternative receptor/signaling pathway producing opposite polarity; this is not supported in the canonical mechanism.\n- Collapse and immediate cessation (D) requires strong activation of the pathway, which is not possible without Nrp1.\n- Compensatory upregulation of another co-receptor such as Nrp2 (E) is speculative and not guaranteed; moreover, Sema3A preferentially signals through Nrp1, and the problem asks for the most likely outcome under the stated conditions.\n\n6. Conclusion: Lacking Nrp1 prevents Sema3A signaling; thus the growth cone’s trajectory will be unaffected by the Sema3A gradient.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that the growth cone’s direction of growth is unaffected by the Sema3A gradient.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2341141"}, {"introduction": "We have seen that the correct receptor components are necessary, but what happens *after* a guidance cue binds? The signal must be relayed from the outside of the cell to the inside to trigger a response. This practice [@problem_id:2341111] returns to the Eph/Ephrin system to focus on this crucial step of signal transduction. You will explore why being a Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) is key to its function, distinguishing between the simple act of ligand binding and the essential enzymatic activity of the intracellular kinase domain that actually powers the repulsive response.", "problem": "In the developing nervous system, axon guidance is a critical process orchestrated by molecular cues. One such family of cues is the ephrin family and their corresponding Eph receptors. Consider a population of cortical neurons that are guided by long-range repulsive signals. These neurons extend axons whose growth cones express EphA4, a transmembrane Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK). The axons are navigating towards a target region, but are prevented from entering a specific adjacent zone because the cells in that zone express a high concentration of Ephrin-A5, a protein anchored to the exterior of the cell membrane. The binding of EphA4 on the growth cone to Ephrin-A5 on the zonal cells normally triggers a signaling cascade within the axon that results in cytoskeletal collapse and repulsion.\n\nA molecular biologist develops a genetically modified line of these neurons. In this modified line, the gene for EphA4 has been altered to produce a \"kinase-dead\" version of the receptor. This mutant EphA4 protein is correctly synthesized, folded, and transported to the growth cone membrane. It is also capable of binding to its ligand, Ephrin-A5, with normal affinity. However, its intracellular tyrosine kinase domain is catalytically inactive and cannot perform phosphorylation.\n\nThese genetically modified neurons are placed in a culture system designed to mimic the in vivo environment, where their axons grow towards a region of a substrate coated with a high concentration of Ephrin-A5. What will be the most likely behavior of these axons as they encounter the Ephrin-A5-coated region?\n\nA. The axons will be strongly attracted to the Ephrin-A5 region.\n\nB. The axons' repulsive response will be unaffected, and they will turn away as normal.\n\nC. The axons will ignore the Ephrin-A5 and grow into the region without repulsion.\n\nD. The axons will cease all growth and movement immediately upon contacting the Ephrin-A5.\n\nE. The axons will exhibit a significantly stronger repulsive response than wild-type neurons.", "solution": "Eph receptors are receptor tyrosine kinases. The canonical forward signaling mechanism that drives repulsive axon guidance proceeds as follows:\n1) Ephrin-A5 on the substrate binds EphA4 on the growth cone, inducing receptor clustering.\n2) In wild-type EphA4, clustering enables trans-autophosphorylation on intracellular tyrosine residues.\n3) These phosphotyrosines serve as docking sites for SH2- and PTB-domain adaptor proteins and kinases (for example, Src family kinases), initiating a signaling cascade.\n4) Downstream, Rho family GTPases are modulated (typically RhoA/ROCK activation with concomitant suppression of Rac1/Cdc42 in specific compartments), leading to actin depolymerization and microtubule destabilization in the growth cone, which causes growth cone collapse and repulsion from the ephrin-A5 region.\n\nIn the genetically modified neurons, EphA4 is kinase-dead:\n- It binds ephrin-A5 with normal affinity and can cluster, but its intracellular kinase domain is catalytically inactive, so it cannot autophosphorylate tyrosines.\n- Without autophosphorylation, EphA4 fails to create phosphotyrosine docking sites, preventing recruitment of SH2-domain-containing effectors and blocking the forward signaling cascade required for repulsion.\n- Therefore, the intracellular events that drive cytoskeletal collapse do not occur, and the growth cone does not mount the repulsive response.\n\nEphrin-A ligands can mediate reverse signaling, but ephrin-A5 is presented on the substrate; any reverse signaling would occur in the ephrin-expressing substrate cells, not in the neuron. Hence, reverse signaling cannot substitute for forward signaling inside the growth cone to generate repulsion. The absence of forward signaling also rules out stronger repulsion or immediate cessation of growth. Attraction is not expected because the EphA4-ephrin-A5 pair mediates repulsion via forward signaling in this context, and no alternative attraction pathway in the neuron is engaged by a kinase-dead EphA4.\n\nThus, when encountering a region coated with ephrin-A5, these kinase-dead EphA4-expressing axons will fail to be repelled and will grow into the ephrin-A5 region, effectively ignoring the repulsive cue.\n\nEliminating options:\n- A is incorrect: attraction is not mediated by kinase-dead EphA4 forward signaling.\n- B is incorrect: repulsion requires EphA4 kinase activity.\n- D is incorrect: immediate cessation of all growth requires a strong collapse signal, which is absent.\n- E is incorrect: loss of kinase activity would weaken, not strengthen, repulsion.\n\nThe correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2341111"}]}
