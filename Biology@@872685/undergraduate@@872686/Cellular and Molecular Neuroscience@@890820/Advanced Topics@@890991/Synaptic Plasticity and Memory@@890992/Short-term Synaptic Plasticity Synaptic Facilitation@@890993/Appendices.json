The amplitude of this first EPSP is measured to be 2.0 mV.\n\nThe synapse exhibits a characteristic form of short-term enhancement known as paired-pulse facilitation. This phenomenon is quantified by the paired-pulse ratio (PPR), which is defined as the ratio of the second EPSP's amplitude to the first EPSP's amplitude.

This terminal has a readily releasable pool (RRP) containing exactly one synaptic vesicle ($N=1$). When an action potential arrives, this vesicle is released with a certain probability.

This facilitates the release mechanism for the second pulse. The facilitation is described by a multiplicative factor $F=1.6$, such that the conditional probability of release for the second pulse, $p_2$, is given by $p_2 = F \\cdot p_1$, assuming the vesicle was not released by the first pulse.
