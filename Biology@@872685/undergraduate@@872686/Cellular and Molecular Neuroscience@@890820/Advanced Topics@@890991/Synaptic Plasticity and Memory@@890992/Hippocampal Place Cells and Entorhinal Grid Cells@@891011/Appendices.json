Mastering this logic is key to understanding how scientists investigate the complex interplay between different streams of spatial information.", "problem": "A team of neuroscientists is studying spatial navigation in a rat. The rat is trained to run along a one-dimensional linear track of length $L$ in complete darkness. The track starts at position $x=0$ and ends at $x=L$. A microelectrode records the activity of a single hippocampal place cell. During training, the rat always starts at $x=0$ and runs to the end of the track. A small, non-diffusive olfactory cue (a drop of cedarwood oil) is placed at the midpoint of the track, $x=L/2$. The researchers observe that the place cell consistently fires with maximum activity when the rat is at the position $x=L/2$.\n\nTo determine whether the cell's firing is controlled by the external olfactory cue or by the rat's internal sense of self-motion and distance traveled (a process known as path integration), they conduct a critical experiment. After the initial training, the rat is picked up from the starting point ($x=0$) and passively transported in an opaque, enclosed cart (preventing any visual or self-motion cues) to the position $x=L/4$. From this new starting point, the rat is released and runs along the track towards $x=L$.\n\nAssume the place cell is exclusively controlled by only one of the two possible mechanisms (either the olfactory cue or path integration). Which of the following statements accurately describes the predicted outcome of this experiment?\n\nA. If controlled by path integration, the cell will fire at $x=L/2$. If controlled by the olfactory cue, it will fire at $x=3L/4$.\n\nB. If controlled by path integration, the cell will fire at $x=3L/4$. If controlled by the olfactory cue, it will fire at $x=L/2$.\n\nC. If controlled by path integration, the cell will fire at $x=L/4$. If controlled by the olfactory cue, it will fire at $x=L/2$.\n\nD. The place cell will not fire in this trial because the initial conditions have changed, resetting the cognitive map.\n\nE. The place cell will fire at both $x=L/2$ and $x=3L/4$ as the brain attempts to reconcile the conflicting information.", "solution": "During training, the rat starts at $x=0$ and the cell fires maximally at $x=L/2$. This observation is consistent with two distinct control mechanisms:\n- Cue control: the firing is anchored to the fixed external olfactory cue at position $x_{c}=L/2$.\n- Path integration: the firing is anchored to a fixed traveled distance from the start. Since the start is at $x=0$ and the firing occurs at $x=L/2$, the criterion is a path-integrated distance $d^{*}=L/2$.\n\nIn the critical test, the rat is passively transported (no self-motion cues) to $x_{0}=L/4$ and then released to run. Passive transport prevents updating of internal odometry during transport, so the path integrator’s origin for subsequent running is effectively reset at the release point $x_{0}$.\n\nPredictions:\n- If controlled by the olfactory cue, the firing location is the fixed cue position, so the cell fires when $x=x_{c}=L/2$, independent of starting position.\n- If controlled by path integration, the cell fires when the rat has run the same internal distance $d^{*}=L/2$ from the new start. Starting at $x_{0}=L/4$, the physical position at firing is\n$$\nx=x_{0}+d^{*}=\\frac{L}{4}+\\frac{L}{2}=\\frac{3L}{4}.\n$$\n\nComparing with the options, this corresponds to: path integration predicts firing at $x=3L/4$, and cue control predicts firing at $x=L/2$. This is exactly statement B. The other options either swap these predictions or propose outcomes inconsistent with exclusive control by a single mechanism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2338336"}, {"introduction": "The brain's cognitive map is remarkably flexible, capable of adapting to changes in the environment. This problem [@problem_id:2338331] explores the phenomenon of \"rescaling,\" where place fields stretch or compress in response to geometric transformations of a familiar space. By applying a simple proportional scaling rule, you will calculate how the spatial relationship between neurons is preserved, offering insight into the dynamic nature of hippocampal maps.", "problem": "An experimental neuroscientist is studying spatial navigation in a mouse model. The mouse is trained to run back and forth on a linear track of length $L$. By implanting microelectrodes, the scientist simultaneously records the activity of two distinct principal neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. These neurons are identified as place cells.\n\nIn the initial experiment on the track of length $L$, the first place cell (Cell 1) exhibits a single, stable place field with its peak firing rate centered at a position $x_1 = \\frac{1}{4}L$ from the start of the track. The second place cell (Cell 2) has its place field centered at $x_2 = \\frac{3}{4}L$.\n\nThe scientist then abruptly modifies the experimental setup. While keeping the starting point fixed, the visual cues marking the end of the track are moved, effectively doubling the track's length to $2L$. The mouse is then allowed to explore this new, longer track. The scientist observes that the existing place fields do not disappear or randomly relocate (a phenomenon known as global remapping). Instead, the spatial map \"stretches\" to accommodate the new environment. This stretching is proportional, meaning the new location of a place field is scaled by the same factor as the environmental scaling, relative to the fixed starting point.\n\nAssuming this proportional rescaling model holds true for both cells, what is the new distance between the centers of the place fields for Cell 1 and Cell 2 on the elongated track? Express your answer as an analytic expression in terms of $L$.", "solution": "The original place field centers are at positions $x_{1}=\\frac{1}{4}L$ and $x_{2}=\\frac{3}{4}L$ along a track of length $L$.\n\nWhen the track length is scaled from $L$ to $2L$ with the start point fixed, the spatial coordinates rescale proportionally about the start by a factor\n$$\ns=\\frac{2L}{L}=2.\n$$\nUnder proportional rescaling relative to the fixed start, positions transform as\n$$\nx' = s\\,x.\n$$\nTherefore, the new centers are\n$$\nx_{1}'=s\\,x_{1}=2\\cdot \\frac{1}{4}L=\\frac{1}{2}L,\\qquad x_{2}'=s\\,x_{2}=2\\cdot \\frac{3}{4}L=\\frac{3}{2}L.\n$$\nThe new distance between the centers is\n$$\nd'=\\left|x_{2}'-x_{1}'\\right|=\\left|\\frac{3}{2}L-\\frac{1}{2}L\\right|=L.\n$$\nEquivalently, using the linearity of the scaling,\n$$\nd' = s\\,|x_{2}-x_{1}| = 2\\cdot \\left|\\frac{3}{4}L-\\frac{1}{4}L\\right| = 2\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}L = L.\n$$\nThus, the new distance between the place field centers is $L$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{L}$$", "id": "2338331"}, {"introduction": "A major goal of computational neuroscience is to decode information from patterns of neural activity.
