This first practice problem [@problem_id:2348781] explores the core mechanism of local circuit currents by examining the outcome of stimulating an axon at its midpoint, a hypothetical scenario that clearly reveals the biophysical basis for propagation and helps distinguish it from the normally observed unidirectional signal flow.", "problem": "An electrophysiologist is investigating the properties of a long, unmyelinated squid giant axon. A microelectrode is used to inject a brief, superthreshold depolarizing current pulse precisely at the midpoint of the axon's length. Recordings from electrodes placed at various points along the axon confirm that a full action potential is generated at the stimulation site and then propagates away from the midpoint in both directions, towards each end of the axon.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete biophysical explanation for this observed bidirectional propagation?\n\nA. The stimulation creates a passive flow of positive charge (local current) inside the axon that spreads symmetrically from the stimulation point. This current depolarizes adjacent membrane segments on both sides to their threshold potential, triggering new, independent action potentials that propagate outwards.\n\nB. The artificial stimulation is strong enough to inactivate the Na+/K+ pumps in the immediate vicinity, causing a buildup of ions that diffuses in both directions to trigger the action potentials.\n\nC. The refractory period, which normally ensures unidirectional propagation, is only established after an action potential has passed a segment of the membrane. Since the membrane segments on both sides of the stimulation point are initially at rest, they are both equally excitable.\n\nD. In an unmyelinated axon, the lack of Schwann cells means there is no specific \"forward\" directionality imposed, so any sufficiently large stimulus will naturally travel in all available directions.\n\nE. The initial depolarization triggers a calcium-dependent signaling cascade that releases an intracellular messenger. This messenger diffuses along the axoplasm in both directions, activating voltage-gated channels as it spreads.", "solution": "1. An action potential initiated at the midpoint produces a rapid inward Na^{+} current through voltage-gated Na^{+} channels, depolarizing that segment of membrane. This generates a local transmembrane current that must be balanced by axial (intracellular) and extracellular return currents according to charge conservation.\n2. By passive cable theory, the axial intracellular current spreads longitudinally from the depolarized region into adjacent, still-resting membrane on both sides. Because the axon is effectively homogeneous and unmyelinated, the axial resistance and membrane properties are approximately symmetric around the midpoint, so the local circuit currents spread symmetrically in both directions.\n3. These local circuit currents depolarize adjacent membrane segments. If the depolarization at each adjacent segment reaches threshold, voltage-gated Na^{+} channels there open, initiating new regenerative action potentials in each adjacent segment. Thus, two action potentials are triggered that propagate away from the initiation site in opposite directions.\n4. As each new action potential propagates, the membrane just behind its wavefront enters an absolute, then relative, refractory period due to Na^{+} channel inactivation and delayed K^{+} conductance. This refractoriness prevents immediate re-excitation in the reverse direction, ensuring each wave continues forward along its respective path without collapsing back onto the midpoint.\n5. Na^{+}/K^{+}-ATPase activity is not the cause of the rapid bidirectional initiation; its role is long-term maintenance of ionic gradients, not the millisecond-scale propagation. Similarly, no calcium-dependent intracellular messenger is required for action potential propagation in axons; the process is driven by voltage-gated Na^{+} and K^{+} channel dynamics and local circuit currents.\n6. Therefore, the most accurate and complete biophysical explanation is that symmetric passive local currents from the stimulated midpoint depolarize neighboring segments on both sides to threshold, initiating two independent, outwardly propagating action potentials; initial bidirectionality occurs because both sides are initially excitable, with refractoriness following each wavefront preventing back-propagation. Among the options, this mechanism is stated explicitly in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2348781"}, {"introduction": "Once an action potential passes a segment of the axon, that segment becomes temporarily non-excitable, a state known as the refractory period.

In a hypothetical experiment, two suprathreshold stimuli of equal strength are applied simultaneously, one at the far-left end of the axon and one at the far-right end. These stimuli successfully trigger two independent action potentials that begin to propagate towards each other along the axon. Assuming the axon is sufficiently long for the potentials to travel a significant distance before meeting, which of the following statements most accurately describes the outcome when these two action potentials meet?\n\nA. The two action potentials will pass through each other unaffected, like waves in water, and continue propagating to the opposite ends of the axon.\n\nB. The two action potentials will reflect off each other, reversing their direction of travel and returning to their points of origin.\n\nC. The two action potentials will be extinguished at the point of collision, and the axon membrane at that location and on either side will subsequently return to its resting potential.\n\nD. The two action potentials will merge and form a single action potential with approximately double the amplitude, which will then continue to propagate in one of the two original directions.\n\nE. The two action potentials will merge into a single action potential of standard amplitude that remains stationary at the point of collision.", "solution": "We model the unmyelinated axon as a uniform excitable cable governed by the Hodgkin–Huxley formalism. Let $V(x,t)$ be the transmembrane potential relative to rest, $C_{m}$ the membrane capacitance per unit area, $R_{a}$ the axial resistance per unit length, and $g_{Na}, g_{K}, g_{L}$ the maximal sodium, potassium, and leak conductances per unit area with reversal potentials $E_{Na}, E_{K}, E_{L}$.

An action potential is a traveling pulse solution $V(x,t)=\\hat V(x-ct)$ that regenerates because, ahead of the wavefront, sufficient sodium channel availability ($h$ near its resting value and $m$ rapidly activatable) allows inward current $I_{Na}=g_{Na}m^{3}h(V-E_{Na})$ to exceed outward currents, driving $V$ above threshold and recruiting more $m$ in a positive feedback.\n\nAfter the passage of a spike, the membrane enters a refractory state characterized by sodium inactivation (small $h$) and elevated potassium activation (large $n$). Define the absolute refractory interval $t_{ref}$ as the time after the spike during which no suprathreshold depolarization can elicit another spike because the effective sodium conductance $g_{Na}m^{3}h$ is too reduced and the net slope conductance is dominated by outward terms. The spatial extent of this refractory region behind a traveling wavefront is\n$$\n\\ell_{ref} \\;=\\; c\\,t_{ref},\n$$\nwhere $c$ is the propagation speed of the action potential.\n\nPropagation criterion: A wavefront at position $x_{f}(t)$ advances only if, for $x>x_{f}(t)$ (the direction of propagation), the tissue is excitable, meaning $h$ is sufficiently recovered and $n$ not excessively activated so that a small depolarization produces net inward current:\n$$\\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V}\\Big(-I_{ion}(V,m,h,n)\\Big)\\right|_{\\text{ahead}} \\;>\\; 0,$$\nwith $I_{ion}=g_{Na}m^{3}h(V-E_{Na})+g_{K}n^{4}(V-E_{K})+g_{L}(V-E_{L})$. In the refractory state just behind another wavefront, $h$ is small and $n$ is large, so\n$$ -I_{ion}\\approx -g_{K}n^{4}(V-E_{K})-g_{L}(V-E_{L}) \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V}\\Big(-I_{ion}\\Big)\\;>\\;0 \\text{ favors repolarization,} $$\nand the reduced $g_{Na}m^{3}h$ eliminates the positive feedback required for spike regeneration. Thus a wavefront cannot propagate into refractory tissue.\n\nConsider two action potentials initiated simultaneously at opposite ends of a long axon and propagating toward each other. Each forms a traveling pulse with a refractory wake of length $\\ell_{ref}$ trailing it. Let the pulses approach and meet at $(x_{c},t_{c})$. Immediately after the meeting, for $x<x_{c}$ just to the left and $x>x_{c}$ just to the right, the membrane has just been depolarized by the respective wavefronts and is within its absolute refractory period; hence on both sides of $x_{c}$ over distances of order $\\ell_{ref}$, $h$ is depressed and $n$ elevated. For either pulse to continue past $x_{c}$, it would have to propagate into the region that has been made refractory by the other pulse. However, the propagation criterion above is not satisfied in refractory tissue because the sodium availability factor $h$ is too small and the outward potassium and leak currents dominate:\n$$ C_{m}\\,\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} \\;\\approx\\; \\frac{1}{R_{a}}\\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x^{2}} \\;-\\; \\big[g_{K} n^{4}(V-E_{K})+g_{L}(V-E_{L})\\big], $$\nso any depolarizing axial current arriving from the colliding front fails to produce the net inward current necessary for regenerative activation. Consequently, neither action potential can invade the refractory wake of the other, and both wavefronts terminate at the collision point.\n\nBecause the Hodgkin–Huxley system is nonlinear, superposition does not apply; therefore, the pulses do not pass through each other like linear waves (eliminating option A), do not reflect in the absence of an impedance mismatch or boundary that would invert axial current (eliminating option B), cannot merge to produce double or stationary amplitude given the all-or-none nature and the voltage-clamping effect of the large conductances during a spike (eliminating options D and E). After the transient interaction at $x_{c}$, the membrane currents drive $V$ back toward the resting state determined by the balance $I_{ion}=0$ at rest, and the axon returns to rest on both sides once refractoriness subsides.\n\nTherefore, the correct outcome is that the two action potentials extinguish each other at the collision site, and the membrane subsequently returns to resting potential.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2348818"}, {"introduction": "While the action potential itself is a rapid electrical event driven by passive ion flow down electrochemical gradients, maintaining these gradients over the long term is an active, energy-intensive process.
