By exploring this scenario, you will gain a deeper appreciation for why the coordinated action of both sodium and potassium channels is essential for generating the characteristic shape of an action potential, particularly its rapid repolarization.

In the absence of an increased potassium conductance, the only conductance remaining to repolarize the membrane is the small leak $g_{L}$.
