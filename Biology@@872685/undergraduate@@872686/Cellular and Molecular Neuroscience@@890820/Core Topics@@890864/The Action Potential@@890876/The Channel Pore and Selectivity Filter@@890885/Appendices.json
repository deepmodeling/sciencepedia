A typical Nav channel is composed of a principal alpha subunit that forms the ion-conducting pore. This subunit consists of four homologous domains (I-IV), each containing six transmembrane segments (S1-S6). The pore is lined by the \"P-loops\" located between the S5 and S6 segments of each domain. These P-loops come together in the extracellular vestibule of the channel to form the selectivity filter, the narrowest part of the pore.\n\nA research team is investigating a novel form of inherited erythromelalgia, a disorder characterized by episodes of intense burning pain. They identify a point mutation in the gene for the Nav1.7 channel, which is preferentially expressed in pain-sensing neurons. The mutation is found to cause a single amino acid substitution within the P-loop of domain II. Assuming this mutated channel is successfully synthesized and inserted into the neuronal membrane, which of the following is the most likely and direct functional consequence of this specific mutation?\n\nA. The channel fails to open in response to membrane depolarization.\n\nB. The channel opens in response to depolarization but fails to inactivate, leading to an abnormally prolonged influx of sodium ions.\n\nC. The channel loses its high specificity for sodium ions and allows other cations, such as potassium ions, to pass through.\n\nD. The channel's overall synthesis and trafficking to the cell membrane are completely prevented, resulting in no functional channels on the neuron surface.\n\nE. The channel functions normally in every aspect except that the rate of ion flow (single-channel conductance) for sodium is doubled.", "solution": "Voltage-gated sodium channels consist of four homologous domains (I–IV), each with six transmembrane segments (S1–S6). The voltage sensors reside primarily in the S4 segments, activation gating involves S4–S5 linkers and the S6 bundle crossing, and fast inactivation is mediated predominantly by the intracellular linker between domains III and IV (containing the IFM motif) that occludes the pore after opening. The ion-conducting pore is formed by the S5–S6 regions, with the P-loops between S5 and S6 from each domain dipping into the extracellular vestibule. These four P-loops together form the selectivity filter, whose narrow geometry and specific charged residues (classically the DEKA ring formed by critical residues from domains I–IV) confer high selectivity for sodium over other cations such as potassium.\n\nA point mutation within the P-loop of domain II directly alters the amino acids that line the selectivity filter. The most direct functional consequence of such a mutation is a change in ion selectivity and permeation properties: altering the charge or size at this location disrupts the electrostatic and steric determinants that favor sodium permeation, thereby reducing sodium specificity and allowing other cations (for example, potassium) to pass.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A (failure to open with depolarization) is linked to defects in the voltage-sensing S4 segments or activation gate coupling, not the P-loop.\n- Option B (failure to inactivate) primarily involves the domain III–IV linker and its interaction with the pore, rather than the selectivity filter itself.\n- Option C (loss of high specificity for sodium, allowing other cations to pass) is the direct expectation for a P-loop/selectivity filter mutation.\n- Option D (impaired synthesis/trafficking) is ruled out by the problem’s assumption that the mutated channel is synthesized and inserted into the membrane.\n- Option E (isolated doubling of single-channel conductance) is an arbitrary quantitative change and not the most direct or characteristic effect of a selectivity filter mutation; while P-loop changes can affect conductance, the hallmark and most likely direct effect is altered ion selectivity.\n\nTherefore, the most likely and direct functional consequence is a loss of sodium selectivity with increased permeability to other cations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2352652"}, {"introduction": "The concept of \"selectivity\" can be made precise by examining the underlying energetics of ion permeation.

Successfully predicting the chimera's new ion preference demonstrates a deep understanding of the filter's central and modular role in defining channel identity.", "problem": "A team of molecular neurobiologists is investigating the structural basis of ion selectivity in voltage-gated channels. They start with a well-characterized wild-type voltage-gated potassium channel, hereafter referred to as `K_channel_WT`. This channel is known to be highly selective for potassium ions ($K^{+}$) over sodium ions ($Na^{+}$), with a permeability ratio $P_K / P_{Na}$ that is typically greater than 100. The established mechanism for this selectivity involves the channel's \"selectivity filter,\" a narrow region lined by carbonyl oxygen atoms that are perfectly spaced to coordinate a dehydrated $K^{+}$ ion (ionic radius ~1.38 Å), thereby compensating for the energetic cost of stripping away its hydration shell. The smaller $Na^{+}$ ion (ionic radius ~1.02 Å) is unable to interact favorably with all the carbonyl oxygens simultaneously, making its passage energetically unfavorable.\n\nIn a key experiment, the researchers create a chimeric channel, designated `Chimera-1`, by genetically modifying the `K_channel_WT`. They replace the gene sequence encoding the P-loop, which constitutes the selectivity filter of the `K_channel_WT`, with the corresponding P-loop sequence from a canonical voltage-gated sodium channel. The sodium channel's filter is known to employ a different mechanism, featuring a wider pore containing negatively charged amino acid residues (a high-field-strength site) that selects for a partially hydrated $Na^{+}$ ion.\n\nAssuming the `Chimera-1` protein folds correctly and successfully inserts into the plasma membrane, which of the following statements most accurately predicts its functional permeability profile?\n\nA. The `Chimera-1` channel will become a non-selective cation channel, allowing both $Na^{+}$ and $K^{+}$ ions to pass with similar permeability ($P_{Na} / P_K \\approx 1$).\n\nB. The `Chimera-1` channel will retain its original high selectivity for $K^{+}$ ions, as the overall protein scaffold dictates ion preference.\n\nC. The `Chimera-1` channel will become selectively permeable to $Na^{+}$ ions, exhibiting a permeability ratio ($P_{Na} / P_K$) significantly greater than 1.\n\nD. The `Chimera-1` channel will be non-functional and impermeable to all cations, as the hybrid structure is inherently unstable.\n\nE. The `Chimera-1` channel will change its selectivity to favor divalent cations like $Ca^{2+}$ due to the altered electrostatic environment of the pore.", "solution": "The wild-type channel `K_channel_WT` is highly selective for $K^{+}$ due to its selectivity filter, a narrow region formed by the P-loop where backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms are precisely positioned to coordinate a dehydrated $K^{+}$. This coordination compensates the dehydration energy penalty for $K^{+}$ but not for $Na^{+}$, because the smaller $Na^{+}$ cannot simultaneously coordinate with the same geometry, resulting in a higher free energy barrier for $Na^{+}$ permeation. Thus, in `K_channel_WT`, the permeability ratio satisfies $P_{K}/P_{Na} \\gg 1$.\n\nIon selectivity in voltage-gated channels is primarily determined by the chemistry, geometry, and electrostatics of the selectivity filter encoded by the P-loop. In canonical voltage-gated sodium channels, the filter architecture (e.g., the DEKA motif in many eukaryotic Nav channels) creates a high-field-strength environment with negatively charged residues and a wider pore that stabilizes a partially hydrated $Na^{+}$ more effectively than $K^{+}$. This design reduces the dehydration penalty specifically for $Na^{+}$ and provides favorable electrostatic and steric interactions that lower the free energy barrier for $Na^{+}$ relative to $K^{+}$, yielding $P_{Na}/P_{K} \\gg 1$.\n\nIn the chimera, the researchers replace the P-loop (the selectivity filter) of the $K^{+}$ channel with that from a sodium channel. Assuming correct folding and membrane insertion as stated, the resulting pore chemistry and geometry will be governed by the sodium channel’s selectivity filter. The global protein scaffold shapes gating and overall architecture but does not override the dominant contribution of the selectivity filter to ion selectivity. Therefore, the free energy landscape within the filter becomes sodium-favoring: the partially hydrated $Na^{+}$ will be preferentially stabilized, while $K^{+}$ will not be optimally coordinated, leading to $P_{Na}/P_{K} \\gg 1$.\n\nThis prediction rules out the alternatives:\n- Nonselective conduction ($P_{Na}/P_{K} \\approx 1$) is unlikely because the transplanted P-loop imposes specific chemical selectivity rather than removing it.\n- Retention of $K^{+}$ selectivity is unlikely because the original $K^{+}$-coordinating carbonyl geometry is removed.\n- Nonfunction due to instability is contradicted by the assumption that the chimera folds correctly and inserts into the membrane.\n- Preferential $Ca^{2+}$ permeability typically requires a high-field-strength filter optimized for divalents (e.g., an EEEE-like motif as in many Cav channels), not the sodium channel filter used here, which favors monovalent $Na^{+}$.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that the chimera becomes selectively permeable to $Na^{+}$ with $P_{Na}/P_{K} \\gg 1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2352617"}]}
