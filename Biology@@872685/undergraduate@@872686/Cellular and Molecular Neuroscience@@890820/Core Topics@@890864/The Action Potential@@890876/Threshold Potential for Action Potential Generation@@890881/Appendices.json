This problem presents a hypothetical scenario where a very slow depolarization fails to elicit a spike, even after crossing the previously measured threshold value [@problem_id:2354051]. This phenomenon, known as accommodation, forces us to look deeper into the biophysics of ion channels and appreciate that the rate of voltage change, $\\frac{dV}{dt}$, is just as critical as the voltage itself in determining whether a neuron fires.", "problem": "An electrophysiologist is investigating the firing properties of a single, isolated neuron. The neuron has a stable resting membrane potential of -70 mV. Two experiments are conducted.\n\nIn Experiment 1, a brief, square-wave pulse of depolarizing current is injected into the neuron. It is found that the minimum current pulse required to elicit a single action potential is one that brings the membrane potential rapidly to -55 mV. This value is thus recorded as the neuron's \"threshold potential\".\n\nIn Experiment 2, a different type of current is injected. This time, the current increases very slowly and linearly (a \"current ramp\"), causing the neuron's membrane potential to depolarize gradually over hundreds of milliseconds. The physiologist observes that the membrane potential slowly rises, crosses the previously determined threshold of -55 mV, and continues to rise to a peak of -48 mV, but no action potential is generated. The neuron has failed to fire, a phenomenon known as accommodation.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate biophysical explanation for the neuron's failure to fire an action potential in Experiment 2, despite the membrane potential exceeding the threshold value determined in Experiment 1?\n\nA. The slow depolarization causes the voltage-gated sodium channels to deactivate more quickly than they can activate, preventing the necessary net inward current.\n\nB. The Na+/K+ pump hyperactivates during the slow ramp, pumping out positive charge faster than the depolarizing current can inject it, thus clamping the membrane potential.\n\nC. This observation is a paradox with no known explanation, as any depolarization beyond a fixed threshold potential must, by definition, trigger an action potential.\n\nD. The slow rate of depolarization provides sufficient time for a significant fraction of voltage-gated sodium channels to enter an inactivated state, while also allowing slow-acting, voltage-gated potassium channels to open and increase outward current.\n\nE. The prolonged subthreshold depolarization causes a significant influx of chloride ions (Cl-), whose negative charge hyperpolarizes the membrane and cancels out the effect of the injected depolarizing current.", "solution": "We interpret the brief-pulse threshold in Experiment 1 as a dynamic threshold defined under a rapid depolarization. In a conductance-based framework (e.g., Hodgkin–Huxley), the total membrane current is the sum of sodium, potassium, and leak currents,\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{tot}} = I_{\\mathrm{Na}} + I_{\\mathrm{K}} + I_{\\mathrm{L}},\n$$\nwith\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\bar g_{\\mathrm{Na}} m^{3} h \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\right), \\quad\nI_{\\mathrm{K}} = \\bar g_{\\mathrm{K}} n^{4} \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{K}}\\right), \\quad\nI_{\\mathrm{L}} = \\bar g_{\\mathrm{L}} \\left(V - E_{\\mathrm{L}}\\right).\n$$\nThe gating variables obey first-order kinetics,\n$$\n\\tau_{m}(V)\\,\\dot m = m_{\\infty}(V) - m, \\quad\n\\tau_{h}(V)\\,\\dot h = h_{\\infty}(V) - h, \\quad\n\\tau_{n}(V)\\,\\dot n = n_{\\infty}(V) - n.\n$$\nUnder a fast depolarizing step, $m$ (activation) rises rapidly because $\\tau_{m}$ is small, while $h$ (inactivation) and $n$ (potassium activation) change more slowly because $\\tau_{h}$ and $\\tau_{n}$ are larger. This allows a large transient increase in $m^{3}h$ and hence in $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, producing the positive feedback necessary for an action potential once $V$ crosses the dynamic threshold observed in Experiment 1.\n\nIn contrast, during a slow ramp depolarization, the membrane potential changes over hundreds of milliseconds. This provides enough time for $h$ to decrease toward $h_{\\infty}(V)$ (sodium channel inactivation) and for $n$ to increase toward $n_{\\infty}(V)$ (potassium channel activation). Consequently, even as $V$ crosses the threshold measured under fast conditions, the effective sodium availability $m^{3}h$ is reduced by the decreased $h$, and the outward potassium conductance $\\bar g_{\\mathrm{K}} n^{4}$ is increased. The net effect is that the inward sodium current fails to exceed the outward currents; the positive feedback required for spike initiation is suppressed, and the neuron accommodates, failing to fire despite surpassing the fast-step threshold. This corresponds exactly to statement D.\n\nBy contrast:\n- Statement A is inaccurate in mechanism and terminology: during depolarization, sodium channels activate (increase $m$) and inactivate (decrease $h$); “deactivation” refers to closing upon repolarization, not outpacing activation during depolarization.\n- Statement B is incorrect because the $Na^+/K^+$ pump operates on much slower timescales and contributes a relatively small electrogenic current insufficient to clamp the membrane during a brief ramp.\n- Statement C is false; threshold is not a fixed voltage but depends on rate of depolarization and channel state, hence dynamic threshold and accommodation are well-established.\n- Statement E is implausible in current-clamp with standard chloride conditions; chloride conductance is not the dominant determinant here and would not generally produce the observed accommodation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate biophysical explanation is that slow depolarization permits sodium channel inactivation and potassium channel activation to develop sufficiently to prevent net inward current and spike initiation, i.e., option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2354051"}, {"introduction": "A neuron's excitability is not only dependent on the present stimulus but also on its recent past. This final practice explores the impact of prior activity on the firing threshold through the concept of the refractory period [@problem_id:2354069]. By analyzing why a normally suprathreshold stimulus may fail after a burst of spikes, we can understand the crucial role of voltage-gated sodium channel inactivation in creating a temporary, dynamic increase in the threshold, a mechanism essential for regulating firing rates and shaping neuronal output.", "problem": "A neurophysiologist is studying a neuron in a cortical slice preparation. The neuron has a stable resting membrane potential of -68 mV. Through intracellular recordings, it has been established that the threshold potential for firing an action potential at the axon hillock is approximately -53 mV.\n\nThe experimental protocol involves two phases. First, the neuron is stimulated with a high-frequency train of electrical pulses for 500 milliseconds, causing it to fire a rapid burst of action potentials. Second, after a very brief pause of a few milliseconds following the end of the train, a single test stimulus is delivered. This test stimulus generates an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP) that, when measured at the axon hillock, causes a peak depolarization of +17 mV from the resting potential.\n\nDespite the fact that the peak membrane potential at the axon hillock reaches a value more positive than the established threshold, an action potential is not generated.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most direct and accurate physiological explanation for this observation?\n\nA. A significant fraction of the voltage-gated sodium channels at the axon hillock remain in their inactivated state from the prior activity, preventing a sufficient influx of sodium ions.\n\nB. The high-frequency stimulation caused a persistent opening of voltage-gated potassium channels, leading to a strong hyperpolarizing current that shunted the excitatory stimulus.\n\nC. The presynaptic terminal was depleted of neurotransmitter during the high-frequency stimulation, so the final stimulus released an insufficient amount of glutamate.\n\nD. The preceding stimulation activated nearby inhibitory interneurons, causing a tonic influx of chloride ions that effectively clamped the membrane potential below the true firing threshold.\n\nE. The large calcium influx during the stimulus train activated intracellular enzymes that phosphorylated voltage-gated sodium channels, thereby shifting the voltage required for their activation to a more depolarized potential.", "solution": "We first compute the membrane potential at the EPSP peak. Let the resting potential be $V_{\\text{rest}}=-68\\,\\text{mV}$ and the EPSP amplitude at the axon hillock be $\\Delta V=+17\\,\\text{mV}$. Then the peak membrane potential during the test EPSP is\n$$\nV_{\\text{peak}} \\;=\\; V_{\\text{rest}}+\\Delta V \\;=\\; -68\\,\\text{mV}+17\\,\\text{mV} \\;=\\; -51\\,\\text{mV}.\n$$\nThe baseline threshold for spike initiation is given as $V_{\\text{th}}=-53\\,\\text{mV}$. Since $-51\\,\\text{mV} > -53\\,\\text{mV}$ (i.e., it is more depolarized), in a quiescent cell this would normally be sufficient to trigger an action potential.\n\nHowever, the experiment imposes a high-frequency spike train followed by only a brief pause of a few milliseconds before the test EPSP. Following a burst of action potentials, the neuron is in a refractory state. The key biophysical principle is that the threshold for action potential initiation is not fixed but depends on the instantaneous availability of voltage-gated sodium channels and the opposing potassium conductance. During and immediately after high-frequency firing, a significant fraction of voltage-gated sodium channels at the axon hillock remain in the inactivated state (their inactivation gates have not yet recovered). This reduces the maximal sodium conductance available for the upstroke of the action potential, effectively raising the instantaneous threshold above its baseline value $V_{\\text{th}}=-53\\,\\text{mV}$. Thus, even though $V_{\\text{peak}}$ exceeds the baseline threshold, it may still be below the elevated threshold during the relative refractory period, preventing spike initiation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A directly states that many voltage-gated sodium channels remain inactivated from the prior activity, preventing sufficient sodium influx. This matches the canonical mechanism of the relative refractory period and directly explains why exceeding the baseline $V_{\\text{th}}$ does not produce a spike.\n- B invokes persistent potassium conductance. While increased potassium conductance can contribute to the relative refractory period and shunt inputs, the measured EPSP already reached $\\Delta V=+17\\,\\text{mV}$ at the hillock; the most direct limiting factor for spike initiation despite this depolarization is sodium channel availability.\n- C suggests presynaptic depletion reducing glutamate release. This is inconsistent with the observed large EPSP amplitude at the axon hillock.\n- D suggests tonic inhibitory chloride currents clamping the membrane. This would reduce the observed depolarization; again, the large recorded depolarization argues against this as the primary explanation.\n- E suggests a phosphorylation-mediated shift of sodium channel activation. This is less immediate and not required to explain a failure to fire on the millisecond timescale immediately after a spike train; moreover, the classic and most direct mechanism is inactivation, not a rapid shift in activation voltage.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and accurate physiological explanation is that incomplete recovery from sodium channel inactivation during the relative refractory period elevated the effective threshold, consistent with option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2354069"}]}
