The most crucial of these is the Sodium-Potassium pump ($Na^+/K^+$-ATPase), an electrogenic transporter that creates a net movement of charge across the cell membrane with each operational cycle. This pump actively transports sodium ions ($Na^+$) out of the cell and potassium ions ($K^+$) into the cell, against their respective concentration gradients. This process is powered by the hydrolysis of one molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) per cycle. In a single operational cycle, the pump expels three $Na^+$ ions and imports two $K^+$ ions.\n\nA neuroscientist is studying a large population of cultured neurons and determines that, over a specific time interval, the cells collectively consume a total of $N$ molecules of ATP, with all of this energy being used exclusively to drive their $Na^+/K^+$-ATPase pumps.

We are given the stoichiometry of the pump and the total number of ATP molecules, $N$, consumed.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the charge movement in a single cycle of the pump's operation. The elementary charge is denoted by $e$.\nEach sodium ion ($Na^+$) is a monovalent cation and carries a charge of $+1e$.\nEach potassium ion ($K^+$) is also a monovalent cation and carries a charge of $+1e$.\n\nIn one cycle, the pump expels three $Na^+$ ions from the cell. The total positive charge exported in the form of sodium ions is:\n$$Q_{out, Na^+} = 3 \\times (+1e) = +3e$$\n\nIn the same cycle, the pump imports two $K^+$ ions into the cell. The total positive charge imported in the form of potassium ions is:\n$$Q_{in, K^+} = 2 \\times (+1e) = +2e$$\n\nThe net charge transported out of the cell in a single cycle, $q_{net, cycle}$, is the difference between the total charge that exits and the total charge that enters.\n$$q_{net, cycle} = Q_{out, Na^+} - Q_{in, K^+}$$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$$q_{net, cycle} = (+3e) - (+2e) = +e$$\nThis positive result confirms that there is a net export of positive charge from the cell with each cycle, which is why the pump is described as electrogenic.\n\nThe problem states that one cycle of the pump is fueled by the hydrolysis of one molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). Therefore, the consumption of one ATP molecule corresponds to a net export of charge equal to $+e$.\n\nThe entire population of neurons consumes a total of $N$ molecules of ATP. Since all this ATP is used to power the $Na^+/K^+$-ATPase pumps and each ATP molecule drives one cycle, a total of $N$ cycles occur across the population.\n\nThe total net charge, $Q_{net}$, transported out of the neuron population is the net charge per cycle multiplied by the total number of cycles.\n$$Q_{net} = q_{net, cycle} \\times (\\text{number of cycles})$$\n$$Q_{net} = (+e) \\times N$$\n$$Q_{net} = Ne$$\n\nThus, the total net charge exported from the neurons is given by the expression $Ne$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{Ne}$$", "id": "2341818"}, {"introduction": "A neuron's resting state is not static but a dynamic equilibrium where the active work of the $Na^+/K^+$ pump precisely balances the passive leakage of ions across the membrane.
