The neuron is held at various command potentials, and the neurotransmitter glutamate is briefly applied to the cell. The resulting peak inward or outward current is measured at each potential. The experiment is performed in a solution that contains antagonists for all receptors except for a specific type of ionotropic glutamate receptor being studied. When the peak current is plotted against the holding potential, the resulting Current-Voltage (I-V) relationship is observed to be nearly perfectly linear over the range of -80 mV to +40 mV. Furthermore, the current is found to reverse its direction (i.e., the net current is zero) at a membrane potential of exactly 0 mV.\n\nBased on these specific electrophysiological properties, which of the following receptor types is most likely responsible for the observed current?\n\nA. $\\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor\n\nB. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor\n\nC. Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA$_\\text{A}$) receptor\n\nD. Metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)\n\nE. Voltage-gated potassium channel", "solution": "In a voltage-clamp experiment, the peak ligand-gated current at a holding potential $V$ can be written as\n$$\nI(V) = g(V)\\,\\big(V - E_{rev}\\big),\n$$\nwhere $E_{rev}$ is the reversal potential of the channel and $g(V)$ is the conductance that may or may not depend on voltage. A nearly perfectly linear I–V relationship over a wide range implies $g(V) \\approx \\text{constant}$ (ohmic behavior), so the channel has negligible intrinsic voltage dependence or voltage-dependent block in that range. The fact that the current reverses at exactly $V=0$ mV implies\n$$\nE_{rev} = 0 \\text{ mV}.\n$$\n\nFor a nonselective cation channel permeable to $Na^{+}$ and $K^{+}$, the reversal potential is given by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz expression for monovalent cations:\n$$\nE_{rev} = \\frac{RT}{F}\\,\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{P_{Na}[Na^{+}]_{o} + P_{K}[K^{+}]_{o}}{P_{Na}[Na^{+}]_{i} + P_{K}[K^{+}]_{i}}\\right).\n$$\nWhen $P_{Na} \\approx P_{K}$ and the typical ionic gradients apply (with $[Na^{+}]_{o} \\gg [Na^{+}]_{i}$ and $[K^{+}]_{i} \\gg [K^{+}]_{o}$), the numerator and denominator are of similar magnitude, making the logarithm close to zero and thus\n$$\nE_{rev} \\approx 0 \\text{ mV}.\n$$\nMoreover, such channels exhibit approximately constant conductance over the tested range, yielding an ohmic, nearly linear I–V relation. These properties are characteristic of AMPA receptors.\n\nIn contrast:\n- NMDA receptors exhibit strong voltage-dependent $Mg^{2+}$ block, so $g(V)$ is voltage dependent and the I–V curve is markedly non-linear (inward rectification/J-shaped), despite an $E_{rev}$ near 0 mV.\n- GABA$_\\text{A}$ receptors are chloride channels with $E_{rev} \\approx E_{Cl}$, typically negative relative to 0 mV, and they are not activated by glutamate.\n- Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are G-protein-coupled and do not produce fast, linear ionotropic currents directly.\n- Voltage-gated $K^{+}$ channels are not glutamate-gated and have $E_{rev} \\approx E_{K}$, which is typically negative, and show voltage-dependent gating leading to non-linear I–V relations.\n\nTherefore, the receptor that best matches a linear I–V with $E_{rev} = 0$ mV under glutamate application is the AMPA receptor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2339995"}, {"introduction": "Synapses don't just respond to single, isolated events; they must process information during rapid bursts of activity. A key property that governs this is desensitization, where receptors temporarily inactivate even when glutamate is still present. This practice [@problem_id:2340019] explores the crucial role of desensitization in shaping the postsynaptic response during high-frequency stimulation, demonstrating how this intrinsic receptor mechanism modulates information flow.", "problem": "In the central nervous system, glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter. When released into a synapse, it binds to various receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. One such receptor is the $\\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor, an ionotropic receptor that, upon binding glutamate, opens a channel permeable to sodium ($Na^{+}$) and potassium ($K^{+}$) ions, resulting in a net influx of positive charge and an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP).\n\nUnder conditions of high-frequency stimulation, where the presynaptic neuron releases rapid, successive bursts of glutamate, AMPA receptors normally exhibit a property called desensitization. This is a process where the receptor's ion channel closes even while glutamate remains bound, thereby reducing the ionic current for subsequent glutamate binding events.\n\nConsider a patch-clamp experiment on a neuron where a presynaptic terminal is stimulated with a high-frequency train of electrical pulses, causing a sustained release of glutamate. A hypothetical drug, \"Synaptomodulin,\" is then applied to the synapse. This drug specifically and completely prevents the desensitization of AMPA receptors without affecting glutamate binding, receptor activation, or ion channel conductance.\n\nCompared to the response observed in the absence of the drug, what would be the predicted effect of Synaptomodulin on the postsynaptic neuron's membrane potential during this high-frequency stimulation?\n\nA. The postsynaptic membrane potential would show a smaller and more transient depolarization.\n\nB. The postsynaptic membrane potential would show a larger and more prolonged depolarization.\n\nC. The postsynaptic membrane potential would show no significant change.\n\nD. The postsynaptic membrane potential would show a hyperpolarization instead of a depolarization.\n\nE. The postsynaptic response would be converted into a rapid series of identical, non-summating action potentials.", "solution": "AMPA receptors are ligand-gated cation channels that, when open, carry an inward current at resting membrane potentials because the mixed cation reversal potential satisfies $E_{\\text{AMPA}} > V_{\\text{rest}}$. The synaptic current through AMPA receptors can be written as\n$$\nI_{\\text{AMPA}}(t) = g_{\\text{AMPA}}(t)\\,\\big(V(t) - E_{\\text{AMPA}}\\big),\n$$\nso for $V(t) < E_{\\text{AMPA}}$ one has $I_{\\text{AMPA}}(t) < 0$ (inward), which depolarizes the membrane.\n\nThe membrane equation with a leak and AMPA conductance is\n$$\nC_{m}\\,\\frac{dV}{dt} = -g_{L}\\big(V - E_{L}\\big) - g_{\\text{AMPA}}(t)\\big(V - E_{\\text{AMPA}}\\big).\n$$\nUnder high-frequency glutamate release, desensitization normally reduces $g_{\\text{AMPA}}(t)$ during the train, decreasing the inward current and thereby diminishing and shortening the EPSPs that would otherwise summate.\n\nSynaptomodulin specifically prevents desensitization without altering binding, activation, or single-channel conductance. Therefore, during the train $g_{\\text{AMPA}}(t)$ remains higher for as long as glutamate is present, maintaining a larger inward current. The steady state during sustained activation, obtained by setting $\\frac{dV}{dt}=0$, is\n$$\nV^{*} = \\frac{g_{L}E_{L} + g_{\\text{AMPA}}E_{\\text{AMPA}}}{g_{L} + g_{\\text{AMPA}}}.\n$$\nAn increase in $g_{\\text{AMPA}}$ shifts $V^{*}$ toward $E_{\\text{AMPA}}$, i.e., to a more depolarized level, and sustains that depolarization throughout the high-frequency stimulation period. Although the membrane time constant $\\tau = \\frac{C_{m}}{g_{L} + g_{\\text{AMPA}}}$ decreases as $g_{\\text{AMPA}}$ increases, the key effect during the train is a larger and maintained depolarized plateau due to the larger persistent conductance and enhanced temporal summation.\n\nThus, compared to control, preventing desensitization yields a larger and more prolonged depolarization during high-frequency stimulation.\n\nEvaluating the options: A is opposite to the predicted effect, C and D contradict the excitatory nature of AMPA currents, and E is incorrect because preventing desensitization does not enforce identical, non-summating spikes; instead it promotes summation.

By analyzing these data, you will quantify the change in receptor population during a model of synaptic strengthening known as Long-Term Potentiation (LTP).", "problem": "A team of neuroscientists is investigating synaptic plasticity in cultured hippocampal neurons. They have transfected these neurons to express a modified version of the $\\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor, where the GluA1 subunit is tagged with a Super Ecliptic pHluorin (SEP). SEP is a pH-sensitive variant of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) whose fluorescence is dependent on the local pH.

First, they measure the baseline fluorescence from a set of dendritic spines, obtaining an average value of $F_{base} = 120$ arbitrary units (a.u.). Next, they apply a chemical Long-Term Potentiation (cLTP) induction protocol, which is known to cause the insertion of AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. After the protocol, they measure the fluorescence from the same set of spines and find it has increased to $F_{LTP} = 165$ a.u. Finally, to determine the total number of SEP-tagged receptors available in the spines (both on the surface and in the internal vesicular pool), they apply a solution containing ammonium chloride ($NH_4Cl$). This treatment neutralizes all acidic intracellular compartments, causing all SEP tags to fluoresce maximally. This measurement yields a total fluorescence of $F_{total} = 400$ a.u.\n\nBased on these measurements, calculate the fractional increase in the number of AMPA receptors on the surface of the dendritic spines following cLTP, relative to the initial surface population.
