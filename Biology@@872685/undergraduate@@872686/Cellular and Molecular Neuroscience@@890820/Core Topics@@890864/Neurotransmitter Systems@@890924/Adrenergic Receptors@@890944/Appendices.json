This exercise [@problem_id:2326649] presents a thought experiment involving a \"chimeric\" receptor, which combines parts from two different adrenergic subtypes. By predicting the signaling outcome, you will explore the elegant modularity of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), reinforcing the crucial concept that ligand binding and G-protein activation are handled by distinct structural domains.", "problem": "In a cell biology laboratory, a research team constructs a chimeric G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) to investigate the modularity of signal transduction. This engineered receptor combines the structural domains from two different adrenergic receptors. The extracellular and transmembrane domains, which collectively form the ligand-binding site, are taken from the human $\\beta_2$-adrenergic receptor. The intracellular domains, which are responsible for coupling to and activating a specific heterotrimeric G-protein, are taken from the human $\\alpha_1$-adrenergic receptor.\n\nThese chimeric receptors are then functionally expressed in a cell line that does not natively express adrenergic receptors but contains the necessary downstream signaling components for all major GPCR pathways. The cells are subsequently treated with isoproterenol, a potent synthetic agonist for the $\\beta_2$-adrenergic receptor.\n\nAssuming the chimeric receptor is properly expressed and folded, which of the following outcomes describes the most immediate and primary change in intracellular second messenger concentrations upon application of isoproterenol?\n\nA. A significant increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).\n\nB. A significant decrease in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).\n\nC. A significant increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG).\n\nD. A significant increase in the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the receptor's cytoplasmic tail.\n\nE. No significant change in the concentration of any second messengers.", "solution": "The key principle is that GPCR ligand specificity is determined primarily by the extracellular and transmembrane domains (the ligand-binding pocket), while G-protein coupling specificity is conferred by the intracellular loops and C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. In this chimera, the extracellular and transmembrane regions come from the human $\\beta_2$-adrenergic receptor, so isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, will bind and activate the receptor. However, the intracellular portions are from the human $\\alpha_1$-adrenergic receptor, which canonically couples to the $G_{q/11}$ family rather than $G_s$.\n\nUpon agonist binding, the conformational change in the receptor is transmitted to its intracellular domains, which dictate coupling to $G_q$. Activated $G_q$ stimulates phospholipase C beta, which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. The most immediate and primary change in second messengers is therefore a rise in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol; inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate also acutely elevates cytosolic calcium by release from intracellular stores.\n\nBy contrast, an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate would require coupling to $G_s$ (typical of $\\beta_2$ with native intracellular domains), which this chimera lacks; a decrease in cyclic adenosine monophosphate would require $G_i$ coupling (typical of $\\alpha_2$), which is also absent. Autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues is a hallmark of receptor tyrosine kinases, not GPCRs. Given proper expression and folding and the presence of downstream components, no-change is implausible because the receptor will both bind ligand and couple to $G_q$.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and primary second messenger change is an increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2326649"}, {"introduction": "Moving from foundational principles to experimental application, a key skill for any neuropharmacologist is identifying which specific receptors are expressed by a cell. This problem [@problem_id:2326666] places you in the role of a researcher, challenging you to interpret a set of pharmacological data. By analyzing how selective agonists and antagonists affect intracellular second messenger levels, you will practice the logical deduction required to characterize a cell's adrenergic signaling profile.", "problem": "A team of neuropharmacologists is studying a newly isolated neuronal cell line to characterize its response to adrenergic signaling. Their primary hypothesis is that these neurons express functional $\\alpha_2$-adrenergic receptors. The key second messenger they are measuring is intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).\n\nIt is known that $\\alpha_2$-adrenergic receptors are coupled to inhibitory G-proteins ($G_i$), which inhibit the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, leading to a decrease in intracellular cAMP levels. Conversely, $\\beta$-adrenergic receptors are coupled to stimulatory G-proteins ($G_s$), which activate adenylyl cyclase and increase cAMP levels.\n\nThe researchers conduct a series of experiments where they expose the cells to different pharmacological agents and measure the resulting steady-state intracellular cAMP concentration relative to the baseline (untreated cells). The baseline cAMP concentration is normalized to 100%.\n\nThe following agents are used:\n- **Clonidine:** A selective agonist for $\\alpha_2$-adrenergic receptors.\n- **Yohimbine:** A selective antagonist for $\\alpha_2$-adrenergic receptors.\n- **Isoproterenol:** A selective agonist for all $\\beta$-adrenergic receptors.\n\nThe results of their experiments are as follows:\n\n- **Condition 1:** Application of Clonidine alone resulted in a cAMP level of 45%.\n- **Condition 2:** Application of Yohimbine alone resulted in a cAMP level of 100%.\n- **Condition 3:** Co-application of Clonidine and Yohimbine resulted in a cAMP level of 98%.\n- **Condition 4:** Application of Isoproterenol alone resulted in a cAMP level of 320%.\n\nBased on this complete set of experimental data, which of the following conclusions is the most strongly supported?\n\nA. The neurons express functional $\\beta$-adrenergic receptors but not functional $\\alpha_2$-adrenergic receptors.\n\nB. The neurons express functional $\\alpha_2$-adrenergic receptors but not functional $\\beta$-adrenergic receptors.\n\nC. The neurons express both functional $\\alpha_2$- and functional $\\beta$-adrenergic receptors.\n\nD. The neurons do not express any functional adrenergic receptors, and the observed effects are due to experimental artifacts.\n\nE. Yohimbine functions as an inverse agonist in this cell line, and Clonidine has no effect.", "solution": "Define the baseline steady-state intracellular cAMP level as $1.00$ (normalized untreated control). By signaling principles, activation of $\\alpha_2$-adrenergic receptors couples via $G_i$ to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, yielding a steady-state $[\\mathrm{cAMP}]$ less than $1.00$, whereas activation of $\\beta$-adrenergic receptors couples via $G_s$ to stimulate adenylyl cyclase, yielding a steady-state $[\\mathrm{cAMP}]$ greater than $1.00$.\n\nClonidine is an $\\alpha_2$-agonist. Under Condition 1, clonidine alone produces $0.45$. Since $0.45<1.00$, and this direction of change (a decrease) matches the expected effect of $G_i$-coupled $\\alpha_2$ activation, this observation supports the presence of functional $\\alpha_2$-adrenergic receptors that can inhibit adenylyl cyclase.\n\nYohimbine is an $\\alpha_2$-antagonist. Under Condition 2, yohimbine alone produces $1.00$, equal to baseline. For a neutral antagonist in the absence of endogenous agonist or constitutive receptor activity, the expected effect is no change from baseline; thus $1.00$ supports that there is no detectable constitutive $\\alpha_2$ activity under these conditions and that yohimbine is not acting as an inverse agonist. Specifically, if yohimbine were an inverse agonist at $\\alpha_2$ receptors with constitutive $G_i$ activity, it would reduce $G_i$ signaling and thereby increase adenylyl cyclase activity, giving $[\\mathrm{cAMP}]>1.00$, which is not observed.\n\nUnder Condition 3, co-application of clonidine and yohimbine yields $0.98$. Since $0.98\\approx 1.00$, this is consistent with competitive antagonism at $\\alpha_2$ receptors: the antagonist prevents the agonist-induced $G_i$ effect, restoring $[\\mathrm{cAMP}]$ to near baseline. This reinforces that both clonidine’s effect is mediated via $\\alpha_2$ receptors and yohimbine effectively blocks that receptor.\n\nIsoproterenol is a $\\beta$-agonist. Under Condition 4, isoproterenol alone produces $3.20$. Since $3.20>1.00$, and this direction and magnitude of change (a robust increase) matches the expected effect of $G_s$-coupled $\\beta$-adrenergic receptor activation, this observation supports the presence of functional $\\beta$-adrenergic receptors that can stimulate adenylyl cyclase.\n\nSummarizing the logical implications:\n1) $0.45$ with clonidine alone implies functional $\\alpha_2$ receptors coupling to $G_i$ are present.\n2) $1.00$ with yohimbine alone implies no inverse agonism and no detectable constitutive $\\alpha_2$ activity; yohimbine behaves as a neutral antagonist under these conditions.\n3) $0.98$ with clonidine plus yohimbine implies effective antagonism at $\\alpha_2$, confirming the receptor-mediated nature of clonidine’s effect.\n4) $3.20$ with isoproterenol alone implies functional $\\beta$ receptors coupling to $G_s$ are present.\n\nThese four findings are simultaneously satisfied only if both $\\alpha_2$- and $\\beta$-adrenergic receptors are functionally expressed in these neurons. Therefore, among the provided options, the most strongly supported conclusion is that the neurons express both functional $\\alpha_2$- and functional $\\beta$-adrenergic receptors.\n\nThis conclusion directly rules out: A (contradicted by clonidine’s decrease and yohimbine’s blockade), B (contradicted by isoproterenol’s increase), D (contradicted by multiple robust, pharmacologically specific responses), and E (contradicted by yohimbine being neutral at $1.00$ rather than producing an opposite effect, and clonidine clearly having an effect).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2326666"}, {"introduction": "In a living nervous system, molecular details translate into complex cellular behavior. This final practice problem [@problem_id:2326669] synthesizes our understanding of receptor function by examining how a single neuron integrates signals from multiple receptor subtypes located on different compartments. Your task is to predict the net effect of activating both presynaptic and somatodendritic autoreceptors simultaneously, a scenario that highlights how competing intracellular pathways shape a neuron's excitability and neurotransmitter release.", "problem": "Consider a specialized neuron in the central nervous system that synthesizes and releases norepinephrine (NE) as its primary neurotransmitter. This neuron expresses two distinct types of adrenergic autoreceptors on its surface.\n\n1.  **Presynaptic $\\alpha_2$-adrenergic receptors**: These are located on the neuron's axon terminals. When activated by NE, they couple to inhibitory G-proteins (Gi), which leads to a direct reduction in the subsequent release of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles from that terminal.\n2.  **Somatodendritic $\\beta_1$-adrenergic receptors**: These are located on the neuron's cell body (soma) and dendrites. When activated by NE, they couple to stimulatory G-proteins (Gs). The subsequent signaling cascade results in the inhibition of a specific type of potassium ($\\text{K}^+$) leak channel that is normally open at rest, reducing the outward flow of $\\text{K}^+$ ions across the cell membrane.\n\nImagine an experiment where this neuron is placed in a culture dish and a solution containing a moderate concentration of NE is washed over the entire neuron, simultaneously activating both the presynaptic and somatodendritic receptors.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes correctly predicts the effect on this neuron's function?\n\nA. Neurotransmitter release will increase, and the membrane potential will become more negative.\n\nB. Neurotransmitter release will decrease, and the membrane potential will become more negative.\n\nC. Neurotransmitter release will decrease, and the membrane potential will become less negative.\n\nD. Neurotransmitter release will increase, and the membrane potential will become less negative.\n\nE. There will be no net change in either neurotransmitter release or membrane potential.", "solution": "The presynaptic $\\alpha_2$-adrenergic autoreceptors on axon terminals couple to $G_i$. $G_i$ inhibits adenylyl cyclase and, through $\\beta\\gamma$ subunits, reduces opening of presynaptic voltage-gated $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ channels, lowering the probability of vesicle fusion. Therefore the probability of release $p_{r}$ and thus neurotransmitter output decrease when these receptors are activated.\n\nThe somatodendritic $\\beta_1$-adrenergic autoreceptors couple to $G_s$, which increases adenylyl cyclase activity, raises cyclic adenosine monophosphate, activates protein kinase A, and inhibits a resting leak $\\mathrm{K^{+}}$ conductance. Represent the leak $\\mathrm{K^{+}}$ current as\n$$\nI_{K} = g_{K}\\left(V_{m} - E_{K}\\right),\n$$\nwith $E_{K}$ negative relative to $V_{m}$ at rest and $g_{K}$ the open-channel conductance. Inhibition of the leak channel reduces $g_{K}$. At steady state, the membrane potential can be approximated by the conductance-weighted average\n$$\nV_{m}=\\frac{\\sum_{i} g_{i} E_{i}}{\\sum_{i} g_{i}}.\n$$\nBecause $E_{K}$ is the most negative reversal potential, decreasing $g_{K}$ shifts $V_{m}$ away from $E_{K}$ and toward less negative values, i.e., depolarizes the cell. Equivalently, since $I_{K}$ is outward at rest, reducing $g_{K}$ decreases outward current, which reduces hyperpolarizing drive and makes $V_{m}$ less negative.\n\nWith a uniform norepinephrine application, both receptor classes are activated simultaneously: presynaptic $\\alpha_2$ activation decreases neurotransmitter release, and somatodendritic $\\beta_1$ activation decreases $\\mathrm{K^{+}}$ leak conductance, depolarizing the membrane (making it less negative). The correct combined outcome is decreased release and a less negative membrane potential.\n\nTherefore, option C is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2326669"}]}
