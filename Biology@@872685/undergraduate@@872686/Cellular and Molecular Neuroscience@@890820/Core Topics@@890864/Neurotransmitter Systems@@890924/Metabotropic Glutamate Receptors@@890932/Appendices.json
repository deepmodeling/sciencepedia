The sensor is based on the receptor's extracellular ligand-binding domain, known as the Venus flytrap domain (VFT), which consists of two distinct lobes. A Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP), the donor fluorophore, is genetically fused to one lobe of the VFT, and a Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP), the acceptor fluorophore, is fused to the other. This setup allows the conformational state of the VFT to be monitored using Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET).\n\nThe characteristic Förster radius ($R_0$) for the CFP-YFP pair is given as $5.3$ nm. In the receptor's resting \"open\" state, which occurs in the absence of a ligand or in the presence of a competitive antagonist, the average distance between the centers of the two fluorophores is measured to be $r_{open} = 7.8$ nm. Upon binding of a saturating concentration of the full agonist, glutamate, the VFT transitions to a \"closed\" conformation, bringing the two fluorophores closer to an average distance of $r_{closed} = 4.1$ nm.\n\nAssuming the orientation factor between the fluorophores is constant and incorporated into the given $R_0$, calculate the absolute difference in FRET efficiency, $\\Delta E = |E_{closed} - E_{open}|$, between the agonist-bound closed state and the antagonist-bound open state.

This problem explores the elegant modular design of mGluRs, where different domains are responsible for ligand recognition and G-protein signaling. Through a clever thought experiment involving a \"chimeric\" receptor, you will apply the core principles of GPCR function to predict a signaling outcome, reinforcing the distinction between agonist binding and intracellular pathway selection [@problem_id:2342484].", "problem": "In a molecular neuroscience experiment, a genetic construct is designed to express a chimeric metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) in a stable cell line that endogenously expresses all necessary downstream signaling components. This chimeric receptor is engineered by fusing the extracellular Ligand-Binding Domain (LBD) of mGluR2 with the Transmembrane Domains (TMD) and the intracellular C-terminal Domain (CTD) of mGluR1. The cell line is then treated with a selective agonist known to specifically activate Group II mGluRs (the group to which mGluR2 belongs).\n\nFor context, mGluRs are G-protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) with distinct signaling pathways based on their subtype. Group II mGluRs (mGluR2, mGluR3) normally couple to $G_{i/o}$ proteins, leading to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Group I mGluRs (mGluR1, mGluR5) normally couple to $G_q$ proteins, leading to activation of Phospholipase C (PLC).\n\nWhich of the following describes the most immediate and primary intracellular signaling event that will occur in the cells expressing this chimeric receptor upon application of the selective Group II mGluR agonist?\n\nA. Activation of adenylyl cyclase, leading to an increase in cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP).\n\nB. Inhibition of adenylylyl cyclase, leading to a decrease in cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP).\n\nC. Activation of Phospholipase C (PLC), leading to the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ($IP_3$) and diacylglycerol (DAG).\n\nD. Direct gating of an associated cation-selective ion channel, leading to membrane depolarization.\n\nE. No significant change in intracellular second messenger levels, as the agonist-receptor domain pairing is non-functional.", "solution": "We apply the general principles of G-protein coupled receptor function. For class C GPCRs such as mGluRs, ligand specificity is primarily determined by the extracellular ligand-binding domain (LBD), while G protein coupling specificity is determined by the transmembrane domains (TMDs), intracellular loops, and C-terminal domain (CTD).\n\nStep 1: Ligand recognition. The chimeric receptor contains the LBD of mGluR2. Therefore, a selective Group II mGluR agonist will bind and activate the receptor, because the agonist recognition is dictated by the mGluR2-derived LBD.\n\nStep 2: G protein coupling specificity. The intracellular signaling pathway engaged upon activation is determined by the TMDs and CTD, which in this chimera are derived from mGluR1 (a Group I mGluR). Group I mGluRs characteristically couple to $G_{q}$ proteins, not to $G_{i/o}$.\n\nStep 3: Immediate signaling cascade. Activation of $G_{q}$ leads to activation of Phospholipase C (PLC). PLC hydrolyzes membrane $PIP_2$ into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ($IP_3$) and diacylglycerol (DAG), i.e.,\n$$G_{q} \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\text{PLC activation} \\;\\Rightarrow\\; PIP_2 \\to IP_3 + \\text{DAG}.$$\nThus, the most immediate and primary intracellular event is PLC activation with production of $IP_3$ and DAG.\n\nStep 4: Exclusion of alternatives. Options A and B involve modulation of adenylyl cyclase via $G_{s}$ or $G_{i/o}$; however, the intracellular domains are from mGluR1, which preferentially couples to $G_{q}$, not $G_{i/o}$. Option D describes ionotropic channel gating, which is not a mechanism of GPCRs. Option E is not expected because the LBD-agonist pairing is functional, and downstream signaling machinery is present in the cell line.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is activation of PLC with generation of $IP_3$ and DAG.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2342484"}, {"introduction": "Understanding mGluR signaling pathways is fundamental to neuropharmacology and the development of new therapeutics. This practice problem puts you in the role of an experimental scientist, challenging you to interpret a set of pharmacological data. By analyzing how different inhibitors affect a cell's response to an unknown compound, you will practice the logical process of pathway dissection to determine a drug's precise mechanism of action [@problem_id:2342499].", "problem": "A neuropharmacologist is investigating a novel synthetic molecule, \"Compound Y,\" for its potential effects on neuronal signaling. The experiment uses cultured neurons that express Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). The signaling pathway for these receptors is well-established: agonist binding activates a Gq-protein, which in turn activates Phospholipase C (PLC). PLC cleaves a membrane lipid to produce inositol trisphosphate ($IP_3$), which then binds to $IP_3$ receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to trigger the release of stored calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) into the cytoplasm.\n\nTo track intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ concentration, the neurons are loaded with a fluorescent indicator dye whose fluorescence intensity increases as cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$ levels rise. The following observations are made under different experimental conditions:\n\n1.  **Application of Compound Y:** When Compound Y is added to the culture medium, a large, transient increase in fluorescence is observed.\n2.  **Antagonist Pre-treatment:** When the neurons are pre-incubated with MCPG, a known competitive antagonist for Group I mGluRs, the subsequent addition of Compound Y causes no change in fluorescence.\n3.  **PLC Inhibitor Pre-treatment:** When the neurons are pre-incubated with U73122, a known inhibitor of PLC, the subsequent addition of Compound Y also causes no change in fluorescence.\n\nBased on this set of experimental results, what is the most plausible conclusion about the action of Compound Y?\n\nA. Compound Y is an antagonist for Group I mGluRs.\nB. Compound Y is an agonist for Group I mGluRs.\nC. Compound Y directly activates $IP_3$ receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum.\nD. Compound Y inhibits the re-uptake of calcium into the endoplasmic reticulum.\nE. Compound Y is an agonist for an ionotropic receptor that is permeable to calcium.", "solution": "The established signaling for Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors is the $G_{q}$-PLC pathway: receptor activation leads to $G_{q}$ activation, which activates PLC, leading to hydrolysis of $PIP_2$ into $DAG$ and $IP_3$. $IP_3$ then binds $IP_3$ receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum, releasing stored $Ca^{2+}$ into the cytosol. This can be summarized as:\n$$\\text{Group I mGluR} \\xrightarrow{G_{q}} \\text{PLC} \\xrightarrow{} IP_3 \\xrightarrow{} \\text{ER } IP_3\\text{R} \\xrightarrow{} \\text{Ca}^{2+}\\text{ release}.$$\nThe fluorescence indicator reports cytosolic calcium with\n$$\\text{Fluorescence} \\propto [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{i}.$$\n\nObservation 1: Compound Y elicits a large, transient fluorescence increase. A transient increase in $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{i}$ is characteristic of $IP_3$-mediated release from the endoplasmic reticulum, though other sources (e.g., ionotropic calcium influx) could also increase fluorescence; the pharmacology will discriminate the pathway.\n\nObservation 2: Pre-incubation with MCPG, a competitive antagonist at Group I mGluRs, abolishes the response to Compound Y. Because MCPG competitively blocks Group I mGluRs, the absence of a response in its presence implies that Compound Y’s effect requires activation of Group I mGluRs. If Compound Y acted downstream of the receptor (e.g., directly on $IP_3$ receptors or on ER calcium pumps), then blockade at the receptor level would not prevent the calcium increase.\n\nObservation 3: Pre-incubation with U73122, a PLC inhibitor, also abolishes the response to Compound Y. This indicates that PLC activity is required for the effect of Compound Y. Therefore, Compound Y does not act at steps downstream of PLC (e.g., directly opening $IP_3$ receptors) and instead requires the intact $G_{q}$-PLC-$IP_3$ cascade.\n\nEliminations:\n- Option A (antagonist) is inconsistent with Observation 1; an antagonist would not produce a large transient increase in $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{i}$.\n- Option C (direct activation of $IP_3$ receptors) is inconsistent with both Observations 2 and 3; neither mGluR antagonism nor PLC inhibition should prevent a direct $IP_3$ receptor agonist from releasing $Ca^{2+}$.\n- Option D (inhibition of ER re-uptake) would not be prevented by mGluR antagonism or PLC inhibition and typically would produce a more sustained elevation rather than a receptor- and PLC-dependent transient.\n- Option E (agonist at a calcium-permeable ionotropic receptor) would not be blocked by an mGluR antagonist or by PLC inhibition, as ionotropic calcium influx does not require the $G_{q}$-PLC-$IP_3$ pathway.\n\nThe convergence of receptor antagonism sensitivity and PLC dependence supports that Compound Y acts upstream in this pathway as an agonist at Group I mGluRs, engaging the canonical $G_{q}$-PLC-$IP_3$ cascade to release ER $Ca^{2+}$ and transiently elevate $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{i}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2342499"}]}
