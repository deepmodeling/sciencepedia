This exercise presents a classic experimental scenario where a GABA-B receptor antagonist is applied to a synapse. By predicting the effect on the postsynaptic neuron's membrane potential, you will solidify your understanding of the fundamental inhibitory role that GABA-B receptors play in synaptic transmission. [@problem_id:2342344]", "problem": "In the central nervous system, Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) serves as the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. Its effects are mediated by different receptors, including the metabotropic GABA-B receptor. This receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that, upon binding to GABA, initiates a signal transduction cascade. This cascade results in the activation of a G-protein-gated inwardly-rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel, which allows potassium ions (K$^{+}$) to flow out of the neuron.\n\nA neuroscientist is conducting an experiment on a postsynaptic neuron that exclusively expresses GABA-B receptors at a particular synapse. In the control condition, a presynaptic neuron is stimulated, causing the release of GABA and a resulting change in the postsynaptic membrane potential. In the experimental condition, the synapse is first treated with a high concentration of saclofen, a specific competitive antagonist for the GABA-B receptor. Following this treatment, the same presynaptic stimulation is applied.\n\nCompared to the response in the control condition (GABA release without saclofen), what is the most likely effect of pre-treating the synapse with saclofen on the postsynaptic membrane potential immediately following the release of GABA?\n\nA. Saclofen will cause a larger and more prolonged hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic membrane.\n\nB. Saclofen will cause a depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane, exciting the neuron.\n\nC. Saclofen will prevent the hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic membrane that would normally occur.\n\nD. Saclofen will have no effect, and the postsynaptic membrane potential will change in the same way as the control.\n\nE. Saclofen will mimic the effect of GABA, causing a standard hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic membrane.", "solution": "We identify the relevant physiological mechanism: at this synapse the postsynaptic neuron expresses only GABA-B receptors, which are metabotropic GPCRs. When GABA binds GABA-B, the associated G-protein is activated, and the released `$G_{\\beta\\gamma}$` subunits open G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. Opening $K^{+}$ channels increases $K^{+}$ conductance, driving the membrane potential $V_{m}$ toward the $K^{+}$ equilibrium potential $E_{K}$, which is more negative than the resting $V_{m}$. Thus, in control, GABA causes a hyperpolarizing inhibitory postsynaptic potential due to $K^{+}$ efflux.\n\nWe formalize the receptor-ligand interaction with competitive antagonism. Let $A$ denote agonist (GABA) concentration and $I$ denote antagonist (saclofen) concentration. For a competitive antagonist, the fractional receptor occupancy by the agonist is given by the law of mass action:\n$$\n\\theta=\\frac{[A]}{[A]+K_{d}\\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}\\right)}.\n$$\nWith a high $[I]$ (as stated), the factor $\\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}\\right)$ becomes large, so $\\theta\\to 0$ for fixed $[A]$. Therefore, receptor activation by GABA is effectively prevented.\n\nBecause the postsynaptic effect (opening of GIRK channels and $K^{+}$ efflux) depends on GABA-B activation, reducing $\\theta$ to near zero prevents the G-protein activation and GIRK opening. Without increased $K^{+}$ conductance, $V_{m}$ does not move toward $E_{K}$, so the hyperpolarization that normally follows GABA release does not occur.\n\nThe synapse is specified to express only GABA-B receptors; thus, blocking these receptors will not produce depolarization (no alternative excitatory receptor is engaged) and will not mimic GABA (saclofen is an antagonist, not an agonist). It will have an effect (it prevents the normal response), so it is not without effect.\n\nTherefore, compared to control, pre-treatment with saclofen prevents the hyperpolarization that would normally occur after GABA release.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2342344"}, {"introduction": "Metabotropic receptor signaling involves a precise cascade of molecular events, from ligand binding to the final cellular response. To confirm the steps in this pathway, scientists often use toxins that specifically block one component. This practice challenges you to think like an experimentalist by predicting the outcome when the crucial G-protein link between the GABA-B receptor and its effector ion channel is broken, thereby clarifying the essential role of Gi/Go proteins in this process. [@problem_id:2342333]", "problem": "A neuroscientist is studying a neuron that expresses metabotropic Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) type B receptors. These GABA-B receptors are coupled to G-protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels via a specific type of G-protein known as a Gi/Go protein. When an agonist binds to the GABA-B receptor, it activates the Gi/Go protein, which in turn causes the associated GIRK channel to open. The opening of GIRK channels allows potassium ions ($K^+$) to flow out of the neuron, leading to hyperpolarization of the cell membrane.\n\nThe scientist first treats the neuron with pertussis toxin (PTX), a substance that irreversibly inactivates the Gi/Go protein by preventing it from being activated by its receptor. After this pre-treatment, the scientist applies baclofen, a potent and specific agonist for the GABA-B receptor, to the neuron.\n\nAssuming the neuron is at a typical resting membrane potential before the application of baclofen, which of the following outcomes is most likely to be observed?\n\nA. Baclofen will have no effect on the neuron's membrane potential.\n\nB. Baclofen will cause a strong depolarization of the neuron.\n\nC. Baclofen will cause an even stronger hyperpolarization than it would without the toxin.\n\nD. Baclofen will cause the same hyperpolarization as it would without the toxin.\n\nE. Baclofen will bind to the GIRK channels directly, causing a weak hyperpolarization.", "solution": "At rest, the membrane potential $V_{m}$ is determined by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation,\n$$\nV_{m}=\\frac{RT}{F}\\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{K}[K^{+}]_{o}+P_{Na}[Na^{+}]_{o}+P_{Cl}[Cl^{-}]_{i}}{P_{K}[K^{+}]_{i}+P_{Na}[Na^{+}]_{i}+P_{Cl}[Cl^{-}]_{o}}\\right),\n$$\nand the potassium equilibrium potential is given by the Nernst equation,\n$$\nE_{K}=\\frac{RT}{zF}\\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{o}}{[K^{+}]_{i}}\\right), \\quad z=1.\n$$\nActivation of GABA-B receptors normally signals through a Gi/Go protein to open GIRK channels, which increases the effective potassium permeability $P_{K}$ (equivalently, the potassium conductance $g_{K}$). The resulting potassium current can be written as\n$$\nI_{K}=g_{K}\\left(V_{m}-E_{K}\\right).\n$$\nAt a typical resting $V_{m}$, one has $V_{m}>E_{K}$, so increasing $g_{K}$ increases the outward $I_{K}$, driving $V_{m}$ toward $E_{K}$ (hyperpolarization). In GHK terms, increasing $P_{K}$ shifts $V_{m}$ toward $E_{K}$.\n\nPertussis toxin irreversibly inactivates Gi/Go by preventing receptor-mediated activation (inhibiting GDP-GTP exchange on the G protein). Therefore, after PTX treatment, baclofen can bind the GABA-B receptor but cannot activate Gi/Go, so GIRK channels do not open. Consequently, $P_{K}$ and $g_{K}$ do not increase, and\n$$\nV_{m}^{\\text{after baclofen with PTX}}=V_{m}^{\\text{rest}}.\n$$\nThus there is no hyperpolarization or depolarization induced by baclofen under these conditions. Evaluating the options, only A (no effect on membrane potential) is consistent with the blocked Gi/Go-GIRK pathway. Baclofen does not directly bind GIRK channels, excluding option E, and hyperpolarization requires functional Gi/Go, excluding C and D; depolarization (B) contradicts the direction of GIRK-mediated currents.\n\nTherefore, the most likely observed outcome is no effect on the membrane potential.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2342333"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative concepts to quantitative analysis is a key step in mastering cellular neuroscience.

The key information is that the current-voltage (I-V) relationship for the GABA-B receptor-mediated current is linear.\n\nThe linear I-V relationship for an ion channel can be described by Ohm's law adapted for electrophysiology:\n$$I = g(V_m - E_{rev})$$\nwhere $I$ is the current flowing through the channels, $g$ is the total conductance of the activated channels, $V_m$ is the clamped membrane potential, and $E_{rev}$ is the reversal potential for the ion(s) carrying the current. In this specific experiment, $g$ and $E_{rev}$ are constants determined by the properties of the activated GABA-B receptor-gated channels and the ionic concentrations across the membrane.\n\nWe have two unknowns, $g$ and $E_{rev}$, and two sets of measurements $(V_1, I_1)$ and $(V_2, I_2)$. We can set up a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $I_1 = g(V_1 - E_{rev})$\n2.  $I_2 = g(V_2 - E_{rev})$\n\nTo find the unknowns, we can first solve for the reversal potential, $E_{rev}$.
