This first practice problem presents a hypothetical scenario involving a G-protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) that is permanently 'on' [@problem_id:2352772]. By examining the consequences of a constitutively active receptor, we can isolate and clearly define the state of its downstream partner, the heterotrimeric G-protein, when it is being maximally stimulated.", "problem": "In a cellular biology experiment, a line of cultured cells is genetically engineered to express a mutant G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). This specific mutation locks the receptor into a conformation that is typically only achieved upon binding its extracellular ligand. As a result, the receptor is constitutively active, meaning it signals continuously, even in the complete absence of its ligand. This mutant GPCR is known to couple to a standard heterotrimeric G-protein, which consists of $G\\alpha$, $G\\beta$, and $G\\gamma$ subunits.\n\nGiven this scenario, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected predominant state of the associated heterotrimeric G-protein population within these engineered cells?\n\nA. The $G\\alpha$ subunit will be predominantly bound to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) and complexed with the $G\\beta\\gamma$ subunits.\n\nB.

An active GPCR (denoted $R^{\\ast}$) functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for $G\\alpha$, catalyzing GDP release followed by GTP binding.

This exercise explores the termination phase of the G-protein cycle using a classic biochemical tool: a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog [@problem_id:2352766]. By simulating the effects of preventing GTP hydrolysis, you can deduce the crucial role this enzymatic step plays in resetting the signaling switch and preventing runaway activation.", "problem": "In cellular signaling, Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) act as molecular switches that are turned \"on\" when bound to Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and \"off\" when bound to Guanosine diphosphate (GDP). An activated G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on the G-protein's alpha subunit, initiating a signaling cascade. The cycle is terminated by the intrinsic GTPase activity of the alpha subunit, which hydrolyzes GTP back to GDP.\n\nConsider an experiment where a population of cells is treated with Guanosine 5'-O-(gamma-thio)triphosphate (GTPγS), a synthetic, non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP. This means that once GTPγS is bound to a G-protein, the G-protein's intrinsic enzymatic activity cannot convert it back to a GDP-like state. Assuming a neurotransmitter is present to activate the relevant GPCRs, which of the following statements best describes the functional consequence for the G-proteins within these cells?\n\nA. The G-protein will be unable to bind to the activated GPCR.\n\nB. The G-protein will be locked in a prolonged \"on\" state, continuously activating its downstream effector.\n\nC.

Binding of GTP to the alpha subunit activates the G protein, allowing the alpha subunit to dissociate from the beta-gamma complex and stimulate downstream effectors.\n- Termination of signaling requires the intrinsic GTPase activity of the alpha subunit to hydrolyze GTP to GDP, returning the protein to the inactive state and allowing reassociation.\n\nEffect of GTPγS:\n- GTPγS is a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog; it binds to the nucleotide site on the alpha subunit similarly to GTP and supports the active conformation, but it resists hydrolysis by the intrinsic GTPase.\n- With a neurotransmitter present, GPCRs are activated and will catalyze GDP release and permit binding of GTPγS to the alpha subunit. Thus, exchange will occur and the alpha subunit will adopt the active conformation and dissociate to activate effectors.\n- Because hydrolysis is blocked, the termination step cannot occur. Therefore, the G protein remains in the active state for a prolonged period, continuously activating its downstream effector.\n\nEvaluation of choices:\n- A is incorrect: GTPγS does not prevent G protein association with an activated GPCR.\n- B is correct: the G protein is locked in a prolonged \"on\" state due to non-hydrolyzable nucleotide binding.\n- C is incorrect: activation and dissociation occur upon GTPγS binding; it is not permanently inactive.\n- D is incorrect: the GPCR-mediated exchange mechanism allows binding of GTPγS.\n- E is incorrect: GTPγS is effectively non-hydrolyzable by the intrinsic GTPase, so activation is prolonged rather than brief.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2352766"}, {"introduction": "The concepts of subunit association and dissociation are central to the G-protein cycle, but how do scientists actually observe these microscopic events?

By predicting the FRET signal change, you will connect the physical separation of G-protein subunits to a measurable output, gaining insight into how signaling dynamics are studied in the lab.", "problem": "In a neurobiology laboratory, researchers are studying intracellular signaling pathways in a cultured neuron. To visualize the activity of a specific heterotrimeric G-protein, they have genetically engineered the neuron to express modified subunits. The $G\\alpha$ subunit is C-terminally fused to Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP), and the $G\\gamma$ subunit of the $G\\beta\\gamma$ complex is C-terminally fused to Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP).\n\nThis system is designed to report on the G-protein's activation state using Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), a mechanism describing energy transfer between two light-sensitive molecules. In this setup, CFP acts as the \"donor\" fluorophore and YFP acts as the \"acceptor\" fluorophore. FRET is highly efficient when the donor and acceptor are in very close proximity (typically less than 10 nanometers), but its efficiency drops off sharply with increasing distance. The experiment is monitored by exciting the CFP with a laser and measuring the emission intensities from both CFP and YFP. The FRET signal is quantified as the ratio of acceptor emission to donor emission (YFP Intensity / CFP Intensity).\n\nAt time $t = 0$, a saturating concentration of a specific agonist is rapidly perfused over the neuron. This agonist binds to a G-protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) that is endogenously expressed by the neuron and known to couple to the engineered G-protein.\n\nAssuming the G-protein cycle proceeds as expected upon receptor activation, which of the following best describes the change in the measured FRET ratio (YFP Intensity / CFP Intensity) immediately following the application of the agonist at $t=0$?\n\nA. A rapid and sustained increase in the FRET ratio.\n\nB. A rapid and sustained decrease in the FRET ratio.\n\nC. No significant change in the FRET ratio.\n\nD. A slow, gradual increase in the FRET ratio over the course of several minutes.\n\nE. An initial rapid decrease followed by an immediate return to the pre-stimulus baseline level, despite the continued presence of the agonist.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the physical basis of the FRET readout in a CFP (donor) to YFP (acceptor) pair. The FRET efficiency $E$ between donor and acceptor separated by distance $r$ is given by\n$$\nE=\\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{r}{R_{0}}\\right)^{6}}=\\frac{R_{0}^{6}}{R_{0}^{6}+r^{6}},\n$$\nwhere $R_{0}$ is the Förster radius determined by donor-acceptor properties, with\n$$\nR_{0}^{6}=\\frac{9000(\\ln 10)\\kappa^{2}Q_{D}J}{128\\pi^{5}n^{4}N_{A}},\n$$\nand $\\kappa^{2}$ is the dipole orientation factor, $Q_{D}$ is the donor quantum yield, $J$ is the spectral overlap integral, $n$ is the refractive index, and $N_{A}$ is Avogadro’s number.\n\nIn sensitized emission FRET measurements under donor excitation, the acceptor emission intensity $I_{\\text{YFP}}$ scales with $E$ (more energy transferred yields more acceptor emission), and the donor emission intensity $I_{\\text{CFP}}$ scales with $(1-E)$ (less donor emission when transfer occurs). Thus, the measured FRET ratio\n$$\nR=\\frac{I_{\\text{YFP}}}{I_{\\text{CFP}}}\n$$\nincreases monotonically with $E$ and, to first approximation, satisfies\n$$\nR \\propto \\frac{E}{1-E}.\n$$\n\nBefore receptor activation, the engineered heterotrimeric G protein resides predominantly in the inactive heterotrimer state $G\\alpha\\text{-CFP}\\cdot\\text{GDP}\\cdot G\\beta\\gamma\\text{-YFP}$, where CFP (on $G\\alpha$) and YFP (on $G\\gamma$ within $G\\beta\\gamma$) are held in close proximity. This corresponds to small $r$, hence relatively high $E$, and therefore an elevated baseline ratio $R$.\n\nAt time $t=0$, a saturating agonist activates the GPCR, which catalyzes GDP-GTP exchange on $G\\alpha$:\n$$\nG\\alpha\\cdot\\text{GDP} \\xrightarrow[\\text{GPCR}^{*}]{} G\\alpha\\cdot\\text{GTP}.\n$$\nActivation of $G\\alpha$ triggers dissociation or a substantial rearrangement of the heterotrimer:\n$$\nG\\alpha\\cdot\\text{GTP} + G\\beta\\gamma \\;\\;\\text{(separate or reorient)},\n$$\nwhich increases the effective donor-acceptor separation $r$ and/or alters the relative dipole orientation (affecting $\\kappa^{2}$). In either case, the immediate effect is a decrease in $E$ because $E$ decreases sharply with increasing $r$ via the $r^{-6}$ dependence, and $R_{0}$ does not increase upon activation. Since $R \\propto E/(1-E)$, a decrease in $E$ produces a decrease in the FRET ratio $R=\\text{YFP}/\\text{CFP}$.\n\nThe time scale of receptor-catalyzed nucleotide exchange and subunit dissociation is rapid (milliseconds to seconds), so the decrease in $R$ is rapid upon agonist application. Under saturating agonist, the activated fraction of G proteins remains elevated due to continuous receptor-driven exchange, so the reduction in $E$ and thus in $R$ is sustained relative to baseline, rather than showing an immediate return to baseline. Any recovery would depend on GTP hydrolysis and system-specific desensitization kinetics, which do not cause an immediate return under continued saturation.\n\nTherefore, the measured FRET ratio (YFP Intensity / CFP Intensity) will show a rapid and sustained decrease immediately following agonist application.\n\nThe best choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2352769"}]}
