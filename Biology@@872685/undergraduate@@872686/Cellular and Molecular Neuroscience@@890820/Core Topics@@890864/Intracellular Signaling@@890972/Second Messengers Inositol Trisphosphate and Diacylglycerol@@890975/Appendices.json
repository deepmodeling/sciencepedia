By hypothesizing the effect of a pharmacological inhibitor, you can trace the essential steps from receptor activation to calcium release and confirm the critical role of Phospholipase C (PLC) in this process. [@problem_id:2350308]", "problem": "In a neurobiology experiment, a researcher is studying intracellular signaling in a primary neuron culture. The focus is on a pathway initiated by a specific Gq-protein-coupled receptor. The canonical signaling cascade for this receptor type involves the activation of the enzyme Phospholipase C (PLC). Activated PLC then cleaves a membrane lipid known as Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two distinct second messengers: Diacylglycerol (DAG) and Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). A key downstream event in this pathway is the release of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which serves as the cell's primary internal calcium store. This release is directly triggered by the binding of IP3 to specific receptors on the ER membrane.\n\nTo probe this pathway, the researcher first pretreats the neuron culture with U73122, a well-characterized pharmacological agent that acts as a specific inhibitor of PLC. After this pretreatment period, a novel agonist that is known to selectively activate the Gq-protein-coupled receptor of interest is added to the culture medium.\n\nAssuming the inhibitor is fully effective and there are no alternative pathways for calcium release triggered by this specific agonist, what is the most likely immediate effect on the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ in the cytoplasm that originates from the cell's internal stores?\n\nA. A rapid and significant increase, as the Gq-protein activation directly opens calcium channels on the ER.\nB. No significant change, because the synthesis of IP3 is prevented.\nC. A significant decrease below baseline, as U73122 enhances the activity of $Ca^{2+}$ pumps that sequester calcium into the ER.\nD. A slow, sustained increase, as DAG can diffuse to the ER and gradually facilitate $Ca^{2+}$ leakage.\nE. A rapid and significant increase, as the agonist is potent enough to bypass the requirement for PLC activity.", "solution": "The canonical Gq-mediated pathway proceeds as follows: agonist binding to a Gq-coupled receptor activates Gq, which stimulates PLC. PLC hydrolyzes PIP2 into DAG and IP3. IP3 then binds IP3 receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, triggering opening of these channels and release of $Ca^{2+}$ from the ER into the cytosol, producing a rapid increase in cytosolic free $Ca^{2+}$ originating from internal stores.\n\nWith pretreatment by U73122, a specific PLC inhibitor, and assuming full effectiveness, PLC activity is blocked. Consequently, upon activation of the Gq-coupled receptor by the agonist, the production of IP3 from PIP2 is prevented. In the absence of an IP3 rise, IP3 receptors on the ER are not activated beyond basal levels, so there is no stimulus for ER $Ca^{2+}$ release. The problem further specifies that there are no alternative pathways for $Ca^{2+}$ release triggered by this agonist, excluding other mechanisms (such as direct receptor-operated calcium influx or ryanodine receptor-mediated release via calcium-induced calcium release) from contributing. DAG, the other product of PIP2 hydrolysis, primarily activates protein kinase C and affects membrane-associated processes; in any case, DAG formation is also blocked when PLC is inhibited, and DAG does not directly cause ER $Ca^{2+}$ release. U73122 does not enhance $Ca^{2+}$ pumps such as SERCA; therefore, a significant decrease below baseline is not expected as an immediate consequence of PLC inhibition.\n\nTherefore, the immediate effect on cytosolic free $Ca^{2+}$ arising from internal stores, under effective PLC inhibition and with no alternative release pathways engaged by the agonist, is no significant change because IP3 synthesis is prevented. This corresponds to option B, while options A, D, and E incorrectly ascribe ER channel activation or bypass of PLC, and option C incorrectly attributes pump enhancement to U73122.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2350308"}, {"introduction": "The Gq pathway famously splits into two branches, initiated by Inositol Trisphosphate ($IP_3$) and Diacylglycerol (DAG). This exercise simulates a common experimental strategy used to parse these divergent signals, using a specific blocker to isolate one branch and quantify its contribution to the overall calcium response. This helps illustrate how neuroscientists can dissect complex intracellular events. [@problem_id:2350324]", "problem": "In a neurobiology experiment, a cultured neuron is studied to dissect the signaling cascade downstream of a specific G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that activates the Gq pathway. The resting, or basal, intracellular calcium concentration, $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{basal}}$, is measured to be $95.0 \\text{ nM}$.\n\nUpon application of a saturating dose of an agonist for this receptor, the Gq pathway is fully activated. This stimulates Phospholipase C, which in turn produces two second messengers: Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate ($IP_3$) and Diacylglycerol (DAG). $IP_3$ triggers calcium release from the internal stores of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), while DAG promotes calcium influx from the extracellular environment through specific channels in the plasma membrane. The combined effect of these two pathways results in a peak intracellular calcium concentration, $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{peak, total}}$, of $920.0 \\text{ nM}$.\n\nTo isolate the contribution of the DAG-mediated pathway, the experiment is repeated on an identical neuron. The neuron is first pre-treated with 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), a reagent that, at the concentration used, acts as a selective antagonist of $IP_3$ receptors on the ER. After this pre-treatment, the same saturating dose of the agonist is applied. In this condition, the peak intracellular calcium concentration, $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{peak, blocked}}$, is measured to be $315.0 \\text{ nM}$.\n\nAssuming that the calcium concentration increases from the two sources are additive and that 2-APB has no other relevant effects on the signaling pathway at the concentration used, calculate the ratio of the calcium concentration increase due to $IP_3$-mediated release to the calcium concentration increase due to DAG-mediated influx. Report your answer as a numerical value rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The goal of the problem is to determine the ratio of the calcium increase due to $IP_3$ to the calcium increase due to DAG.

The desired quantity is the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{IP}_3}}{\\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{DAG}}}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the total increase in intracellular calcium concentration in the control experiment (without any blockers).

In this condition, the $IP_3$-mediated release of calcium from the ER is prevented. Thus, any increase in calcium concentration upon agonist stimulation must be solely due to the DAG-mediated pathway. We can calculate this increase, $\\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{DAG}}$, using the data from the blocked experiment.\n$$\n\\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{DAG}} = [Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{peak, blocked}} - [Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{basal}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{DAG}} = 315.0 \\text{ nM} - 95.0 \\text{ nM} = 220.0 \\text{ nM}\n$$\n\nNow that we have the total increase and the increase due to the DAG pathway, we can find the increase due to the $IP_3$ pathway by rearranging the additive equation:\n$$\n\\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{IP}_3} = \\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{total}} - \\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{DAG}}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\n\\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{IP}_3} = 825.0 \\text{ nM} - 220.0 \\text{ nM} = 605.0 \\text{ nM}\n$$\n\nFinally, we can calculate the required ratio of the $IP_3$-mediated increase to the DAG-mediated increase.\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{IP}_3}}{\\Delta[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{DAG}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{605.0 \\text{ nM}}{220.0 \\text{ nM}} = 2.75\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
