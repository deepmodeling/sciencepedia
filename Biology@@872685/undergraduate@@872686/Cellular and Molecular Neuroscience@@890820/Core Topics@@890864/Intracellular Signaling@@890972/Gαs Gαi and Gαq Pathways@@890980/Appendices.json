They observe that the application of Neuromodulin-X to the neurons leads to a rapid and transient increase in the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) within the cytoplasm. In a subsequent experiment, they first pre-treat the neurons with a compound called U73122, a specific and potent inhibitor of the enzyme Phospholipase C (PLC). After this pre-treatment, the application of Neuromodulin-X no longer produces any detectable increase in intracellular calcium.\n\nAssuming that Neuromodulin-X acts via a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), which of the following G-protein alpha subunits is most likely activated by this receptor?\n\nA.

Gα12/13", "solution": "We are told that application of Neuromodulin-X produces a rapid, transient rise in cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$, and that this rise is abolished when cells are pretreated with U73122, a specific inhibitor of Phospholipase C (PLC). We assume Neuromodulin-X acts via a GPCR.\n\nKey GPCR pathways and their canonical effectors:\n- $G\\alpha_s$ stimulates adenylyl cyclase, increasing cAMP. This pathway does not require PLC, so a PLC inhibitor would not abolish a cAMP-mediated effect. A primary, rapid, transient $Ca^{2+}$ rise is not the hallmark of $G\\alpha_s$ activation.\n- $G\\alpha_i$ inhibits adenylyl cyclase, decreasing cAMP. Again, this is not a PLC-dependent mechanism. Although the $G\\beta\\gamma$ dimer can modulate certain effectors, the canonical $G\\alpha_i$ pathway does not require PLC, and a strict PLC dependence of the $Ca^{2+}$ signal argues against this route.\n- $G\\alpha_q$ activates PLC-β, which hydrolyzes $PIP_2$ to produce $IP_3$ and DAG:\n$$ \\text{PLC-β}:\\quad PIP_2 \\to DAG + IP_3 $$\n$IP_3$ binds to $IP_3$ receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum, opening $Ca^{2+}$ release channels:\n$$ IP_3 + IP_3R \\Rightarrow \\text{channel opening}, \\quad Ca^{2+}_{ER} \\xrightarrow{IP_3R} Ca^{2+}_{cyto} $$\nThis produces a rapid and transient increase in cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$. If PLC is inhibited by U73122, $IP_3$ production is blocked and the $Ca^{2+}$ rise does not occur, exactly as observed.\n- $G\\alpha_t$ (transducin) activates cGMP phosphodiesterase in photoreceptors; this is not relevant to PLC-driven $Ca^{2+}$ release in hippocampal neurons.\n- $G\\alpha_{12/13}$ signals through RhoGEFs to regulate the actin cytoskeleton and cell shape; this pathway is not defined by PLC-dependent $IP_3$ production and rapid $Ca^{2+}$ transients.\n\nTherefore, the PLC dependence and the rapid, transient $Ca^{2+}$ signal identify the pathway as $G\\alpha_q \\to \\text{PLC-β} \\to IP_3$, making $G\\alpha_q$ the most likely activated subunit.\n\nHence, the correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2338243"}, {"introduction": "After identifying a pathway, the next step is to understand how its components work together to produce a coherent cellular response. This problem explores the Gαq cascade in greater detail, focusing on the critical role of intracellular calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) stores [@problem_id:2338259]. By considering a scenario where these stores are depleted, you can appreciate the concept of second messenger synergy, where both Diacylglycerol (DAG) and $Ca^{2+}$ are required for the full activation of downstream effectors like Protein Kinase C (PKC).", "problem": "In cellular signaling, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a vast family of transmembrane proteins that detect molecules outside the cell and activate internal signal transduction pathways. One such pathway involves the Gαq protein subunit. Upon receptor activation by an appropriate ligand, the Gαq subunit activates the enzyme Phospholipase C (PLC). PLC then cleaves a membrane lipid called Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two second messengers: Diacylglycerol (DAG) and Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 diffuses through the cytosol and binds to IP3 receptors on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which function as calcium channels. This binding triggers the release of stored $Ca^{2+}$ ions from the ER into the cytosol. The resulting increase in cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$ concentration, along with the presence of DAG at the plasma membrane, synergistically activates Protein Kinase C (PKC), which then phosphorylates target proteins to elicit a cellular response.\n\nConsider an experiment where a culture of neurons is pre-treated with thapsigargin, a compound that selectively and irreversibly inhibits the Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum $Ca^{2+}$-ATPase (SERCA) pump. This pump is responsible for actively transporting $Ca^{2+}$ from the cytosol into the ER, thereby maintaining the high concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ stores within the ER lumen. After a sufficient pre-treatment period to deplete the ER's $Ca^{2+}$ stores, the neurons are stimulated with an agonist that specifically activates a Gαq-coupled receptor.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes is most likely to be observed in the thapsigargin-treated neurons compared to untreated control neurons upon stimulation with the Gαq agonist?\n\nA. The production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) is blocked.\nB. The activation of Protein Kinase C (PKC) is potentiated, leading to a stronger response.\nC. The Gαq subunit fails to dissociate from its corresponding Gβγ dimer.\nD. The activation of Protein Kinase C (PKC) is significantly attenuated or abolished.\nE. The cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is unaffected, but the production of diacylglycerol (DAG) is inhibited.", "solution": "G-protein coupled receptor activation of a $G\\alpha_q$-coupled receptor leads to the following canonical sequence: ligand-bound receptor acts as a GEF for $G\\alpha_q$, causing GTP loading and dissociation of $G\\alpha_q$ from the $G\\beta\\gamma$ dimer; active $G\\alpha_q$ activates PLC-β; PLC-β cleaves membrane $PIP_2$ to generate DAG and $IP_3$. $IP_3$ diffuses to bind $IP_3$ receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum, opening ER channels and releasing stored $Ca^{2+}$ into the cytosol. Conventional PKC isoforms require both DAG at the membrane and elevated cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$ for activation; thus, DAG and $IP_3$-mediated $Ca^{2+}$ release act synergistically to activate PKC.\n\nThapsigargin irreversibly inhibits the SERCA pump. SERCA normally transports cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$ into the ER to maintain high luminal stores. With sufficient pre-treatment, ER $Ca^{2+}$ stores become depleted because $Ca^{2+}$ uptake into the ER is blocked while passive leak continues. Consequently, upon subsequent $G\\alpha_q$ agonist stimulation, upstream steps remain intact: the receptor still activates $G\\alpha_q$, $G\\alpha_q$ still dissociates from the $G\\beta\\gamma$ dimer, PLC-β is activated, and $PIP_2$ cleavage proceeds to produce both $IP_3$ and DAG. Therefore, statements that $IP_3$ production is blocked (A), that $G\\alpha_q$ fails to dissociate (C), or that $PIP_2$ cleavage is unaffected but DAG production is inhibited (E) are inconsistent with the mechanism, because DAG and $IP_3$ arise from the same PLC-mediated cleavage of $PIP_2$ and thapsigargin acts downstream of PLC at the level of ER $Ca^{2+}$ handling.\n\nHowever, because ER $Ca^{2+}$ stores are depleted by thapsigargin, $IP_3$ binding to ER receptors cannot elicit a robust release of $Ca^{2+}$. The cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$ elevation that normally synergizes with DAG to activate conventional PKC is therefore markedly reduced or absent. Although thapsigargin-induced store depletion can engage store-operated $Ca^{2+}$ entry, the specific $IP_3$-dependent ER release component is lost; thus, relative to untreated controls during $G\\alpha_q$ stimulation, PKC activation will be significantly attenuated or abolished rather than potentiated. Hence, option B is incorrect, and the most accurate outcome is diminished PKC activation as described in option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2338259"}, {"introduction": "We now turn our attention to the Gαs pathway, which modulates cellular function through the second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP). The amplitude and duration of a signal are critical determinants of its physiological outcome, and cells have precise mechanisms to control this.

These neurons express a specific G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that, upon binding to its agonist, activates a stimulatory G-protein alpha subunit (Gαs). The canonical signaling pathway for this receptor involves the following steps:\n1. The activated Gαs subunit stimulates the membrane-bound enzyme, adenylyl cyclase.\n2. Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a key second messenger.\n3. The signaling action of cAMP is terminated by the enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE), which hydrolyzes cAMP into an inactive form, 5'-AMP.\n\nThe researcher treats the neuron culture with two substances simultaneously: a high concentration of a specific agonist for the Gαs-coupled receptor, and a compound known to be a potent inhibitor of PDE activity.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following outcomes describes the most likely effect on the intracellular concentration of cAMP in these neurons, compared to treating them with the agonist alone?\n\nA. The cAMP level will increase, but the magnitude and duration of the increase will be identical to that produced by the agonist alone.\nB. The cAMP level will show a synergistic effect, resulting in a much larger and more prolonged increase.\nC. The cAMP level will ultimately decrease, as the PDE inhibitor will create a negative feedback loop that shuts down adenylyl cyclase.\nD. The cAMP level will not change from the baseline, as the actions of the agonist and the PDE inhibitor have opposing effects that cancel each other out.\nE. The cAMP level will show a brief, transient increase followed by a rapid fall to below the baseline level.", "solution": "The receptor couples to the stimulatory G-protein $G\\alpha_s$, which increases adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity when its agonist is present. AC converts ATP to cAMP, and phosphodiesterase (PDE) terminates cAMP signaling by hydrolyzing cAMP to $5'$-AMP.\n\nThe intracellular cAMP dynamics can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\text{cAMP}]}{dt}=v_{\\text{AC}}-v_{\\text{PDE}}([\\text{cAMP}])\n$$\nAgonist alone increases $v_{\\text{AC}}$, so [cAMP] rises until a new dynamic steady state satisfies:\n$$\nv_{\\text{AC}}=v_{\\text{PDE}}([\\text{cAMP}]_{\\text{ss}})\n$$\nIntroducing a potent PDE inhibitor decreases PDE catalytic activity (for example, an effective decrease in $V_{\\max,\\text{PDE}}$ or the apparent first-order rate constant $k_{\\text{deg}}$ when PDE is unsaturated). With $v_{\\text{AC}}$ elevated by the agonist and $v_{\\text{PDE}}$ reduced by the inhibitor, the production-to-degradation imbalance increases:\n$$\nv_{\\text{AC}}-v_{\\text{PDE}}^{\\text{(inhibited)}}>v_{\\text{AC}}-v_{\\text{PDE}}^{\\text{(baseline)}}\n$$\nso [cAMP] rises to a larger magnitude. At steady state, because the inhibited $v_{\\text{PDE}}$ is smaller for any given [cAMP], the equality $v_{\\text{AC}}=v_{\\text{PDE}}$ is restored only at a higher $[\\text{cAMP}]_{\\text{ss}}$. Moreover, the effective decay time constant is increased; under first-order approximation,\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\text{cAMP}]}{dt}\\approx v_{\\text{AC}}-k_{\\text{deg}}[\\text{cAMP}]\n$$\nso reducing $k_{\\text{deg}}$ both prolongs the response and elevates the peak and steady-state levels.\n\nTherefore, compared with agonist alone, co-application of a PDE inhibitor yields a much larger and more prolonged increase in cAMP. This rules out identical magnitude/duration (A), a decrease via negative feedback (C), no change via cancellation (D), and a brief spike followed by a drop below baseline (E), because inhibition of degradation prevents rapid clearance and promotes accumulation while AC is activated.\n\nThe most likely outcome is a synergistic effect on cAMP magnitude and duration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2338218"}]}
