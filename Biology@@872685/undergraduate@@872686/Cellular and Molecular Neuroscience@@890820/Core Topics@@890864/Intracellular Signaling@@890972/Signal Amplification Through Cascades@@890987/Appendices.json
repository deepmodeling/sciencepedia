The binding of this single ligand causes the receptor to become active.\n\nThe activated receptor, in turn, leads to the activation of a total of $A_G$ G-proteins before it is desensitized. Each of these activated G-proteins has a short lifespan. It remains in an active state for an average duration of $\\tau_G$, during which it binds to and activates a single molecule of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. The adenylyl cyclase molecule is only active for the duration that its corresponding G-protein is active.\n\nWhile active, each molecule of adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) from ATP at a constant rate of $R_{AC}$.\n\nGiven the following parameters for this specific synapse:\n- The total number of G-proteins activated by the single receptor, $A_G = 75$.\n- The average active lifetime of a single G-protein, $\\tau_G = 150$ ms.\n- The catalytic rate of adenylyl cyclase, $R_{AC} = 1200 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n\nCalculate the total number of cAMP molecules produced as a consequence of the initial binding of the single neurotransmitter molecule.

This practice delves into the crucial mechanism of signal termination, focusing on how GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) act as molecular timers for G-protein signaling. By calculating how a hypothetical neurotoxin alters this timing, we can understand the importance of precise temporal control for maintaining cellular homeostasis [@problem_id:2350849].", "problem": "In a particular type of central nervous system neuron, a metabotropic neurotransmitter receptor couples to a heterotrimeric G-protein. Upon receptor activation, the Gα subunit releases its bound Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP), binds a molecule of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP), and dissociates from the Gβγ dimer to become active. The duration of the Gα subunit's activity is terminated by the intrinsic GTPase activity of the subunit, which hydrolyzes GTP back to GDP. This intrinsic hydrolysis is a slow, first-order process with a rate constant of $k_{\\text{intrinsic}} = 0.040 \\text{ s}^{-1}$. To ensure a rapid and well-timed signal termination, the cell employs a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), which significantly accelerates the hydrolysis. The GAP-catalyzed enhancement also follows first-order kinetics, contributing an additional rate constant of $k_{\\text{GAP}} = 1.210 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n\nA newly discovered neurotoxin, \"Tardigen,\" is found to specifically bind to and inhibit this particular GAP, reducing its catalytic effectiveness by $95.0\\%$.
