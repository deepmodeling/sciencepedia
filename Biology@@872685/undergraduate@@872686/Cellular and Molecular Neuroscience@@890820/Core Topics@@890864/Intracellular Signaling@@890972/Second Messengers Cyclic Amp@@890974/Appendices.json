This first practice explores the initial step of the cAMP cascade: the interaction between a neurotransmitter and its receptor. By considering the introduction of a competitive antagonist, you'll apply principles of receptor dynamics to predict the immediate effect on intracellular cAMP levels, reinforcing the link between receptor occupancy and signal generation [@problem_id:2350289].", "problem": "In a neurobiology laboratory, a researcher is studying intracellular signaling in a primary culture of neurons that express a high density of beta-adrenergic receptors. It is known that the binding of the endogenous agonist, norepinephrine, to these receptors activates a stimulatory G-protein pathway, which in turn leads to the activation of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP), a crucial second messenger.\n\nThe experiment proceeds in two stages. First, a solution containing a fixed concentration of norepinephrine is applied to the neuronal culture, leading to a stable, elevated steady-state concentration of intracellular cAMP. Second, while maintaining the same concentration of norepinephrine, a novel synthetic compound is added to the culture. This new compound is known to be a pure competitive antagonist for the beta-adrenergic receptor, meaning it binds to the same site as norepinephrine but does not activate the receptor.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes describes the most immediate effect on the intracellular cAMP concentration after the addition of the competitive antagonist, compared to the steady-state level observed with only norepinephrine present?\n\nA. The cAMP concentration will decrease.\n\nB. The cAMP concentration will increase further.\n\nC. The cAMP concentration will remain unchanged.\n\nD. The cAMP concentration will begin to oscillate with a fixed period.\n\nE. All beta-adrenergic receptors will be immediately internalized, causing cAMP levels to drop to zero.", "solution": "Norepinephrine is an agonist at the beta-adrenergic receptor, which couples to a stimulatory G-protein to activate adenylyl cyclase, increasing intracellular cAMP. Let $C$ denote the intracellular cAMP concentration and assume first-order degradation by phosphodiesterases, so the cAMP dynamics are\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = P - k_{d} C,\n$$\nwhere $P$ is the production rate driven by receptor activation and $k_{d}$ is the first-order degradation constant.\n\nFor a single binding site with a fixed agonist concentration $[A]$ (norepinephrine) and a competitive antagonist at concentration $[I]$, with dissociation constants $K_{A}$ and $K_{I}$ respectively, mass-action binding yields\n$$\nR_{T} = [R] + [RA] + [RI], \\quad [RA] = \\frac{[R][A]}{K_{A}}, \\quad [RI] = \\frac{[R][I]}{K_{I}}.\n$$\nSolving for $[R]$ gives\n$$\nR_{T} = [R]\\left(1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{A}} + \\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}\\right) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad [R] = \\frac{R_{T}}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{A}} + \\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}}.\n$$\nTherefore the fraction of receptors occupied by agonist is\n$$\nf_{A} = \\frac{[RA]}{R_{T}} = \\frac{\\frac{[R][A]}{K_{A}}}{R_{T}} = \\frac{\\frac{[A]}{K_{A}}}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{A}} + \\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}} = \\frac{[A]}{K_{A}\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}\\right) + [A]}.\n$$\nA pure competitive antagonist has zero intrinsic efficacy, so only agonist-bound receptors contribute to signaling. Thus the production rate can be written as\n$$\nP = \\alpha\\, f_{A},\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a proportionality constant capturing efficacy and downstream coupling. With no antagonist ($[I]=0$), the agonist occupancy is\n$$\nf_{A}^{(0)} = \\frac{[A]}{K_{A} + [A]},\n$$\nand the steady-state cAMP concentration $C^{(0)}$ satisfies\n$$\n0 = P^{(0)} - k_{d} C^{(0)} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad P^{(0)} = k_{d} C^{(0)}, \\quad P^{(0)} = \\alpha f_{A}^{(0)}.\n$$\nUpon adding the competitive antagonist at fixed $[A]$, the new agonist occupancy is\n$$\nf_{A}^{(I)} = \\frac{[A]}{K_{A}\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}\\right) + [A]} < \\frac{[A]}{K_{A} + [A]} = f_{A}^{(0)} \\quad \\text{for any } [I] > 0,\n$$\nhence the production rate decreases immediately to\n$$\nP^{(I)} = \\alpha f_{A}^{(I)} < \\alpha f_{A}^{(0)} = P^{(0)}.\n$$\nAt the instant just after antagonist addition, the cAMP concentration is still $C^{(0)}$, so\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dC}{dt}\\right|_{t^{+}} = P^{(I)} - k_{d} C^{(0)} = P^{(I)} - P^{(0)} < 0.\n$$\nTherefore, the immediate effect is that $C$ begins to decrease from its prior steady-state value. Oscillations are not implied by this first-order production-degradation model, and receptor internalization is not immediate nor complete; cAMP will not drop to zero because finite $[A]$ with finite $[I]$ leaves nonzero agonist occupancy.\n\nThus, the most immediate effect is a decrease in intracellular cAMP concentration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2350289"}, {"introduction": "Cells rarely process signals in isolation; they constantly integrate multiple inputs to produce a coordinated response.
