Mastering this simple calculation ensures a solid foundation for understanding the structure-function relationship of these vital intercellular channels.", "problem": "In cellular neuroscience, direct communication between adjacent cells is often mediated by specialized intercellular structures known as gap junctions. These structures create channels that permit the passage of ions and small signaling molecules directly from the cytoplasm of one cell to another. The assembly of a gap junction channel follows a specific hierarchical organization. The fundamental protein unit is called a connexin. A group of these connexin proteins assembles in the cell membrane to form a larger complex called a connexon, which is also sometimes referred to as a hemichannel. A fully functional gap junction channel is formed only when a connexon from one cell aligns and docks with a corresponding connexon on a neighboring cell.\n\nGiven that a single connexon is a hexameric structure, meaning it is composed of exactly six connexin protein subunits, determine the total number of individual connexin subunits that are required to construct a single, complete, and functional gap junction channel connecting two adjacent cells.", "solution": "A connexon is defined as a hexamer, so it contains exactly six connexin subunits. Denote the number of connexin subunits per connexon as $n_{\\text{cx/connexon}}=6$. A functional gap junction channel forms when two connexons, one from each adjacent cell, dock together; thus the number of connexons per channel is $n_{\\text{connexon/channel}}=2$. The total number of connexin subunits per functional channel is then\n$$\nN = n_{\\text{cx/connexon}} \\times n_{\\text{connexon/channel}} = 6 \\times 2 = 12.\n$$\nTherefore, a single complete gap junction channel requires $12$ connexin subunits.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "2332231"}, {"introduction": "A gap junction is more than just a structural link; it acts as a selective filter that regulates intercellular communication. This practice explores the critical concept of size-selective permeability, a key biophysical property determining which molecules can pass between coupled cells [@problem_id:2332262]. By analyzing a common experimental scenario involving molecular tracers, you will learn why gap junctions permit the exchange of small ions and metabolites while blocking larger macromolecules like proteins.", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating a population of newly discovered glial cells in a mammalian brain slice preparation. They hypothesize that these cells are functionally connected into a network, or syncytium, through gap junctions, similar to astrocytes. To test this hypothesis, the researcher plans to introduce a tracer into a single glial cell and observe if it spreads to neighboring cells. They have two tracer options available:\n\n1.  **Tracer A:** A genetically-encoded fluorescent protein with a molecular weight of 29 kDa. This protein can be expressed by transfecting a single target cell.\n2.  **Tracer B:** A low-molecular-weight fluorescent dye with a molecular weight of 0.4 kDa. This dye can be introduced into a single target cell via a microinjection pipette.\n\nThe researcher conducts two parallel experiments. In Experiment 1, they cause a single cell to express Tracer A. In Experiment 2, using a different but identical culture, they load a single cell with Tracer B. After allowing 30 minutes for potential diffusion, they use fluorescence microscopy to image the cultures.\n\nAssuming the glial cells are indeed coupled by typical connexin-based gap junctions, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected outcome and the underlying biophysical principle?\n\nA. Both Tracer A and Tracer B will spread to adjacent cells, as the presence of any channel between cells is sufficient for the passage of both small and large molecules.\n\nB. Only Tracer A will spread to adjacent cells, as its genetic expression allows it to be actively transported into neighboring cells, which is a more reliable indicator of functional connection than passive diffusion.\n\nC. Neither Tracer A nor Tracer B will spread, as gap junctions in the central nervous system are generally impermeable to all molecules to maintain the metabolic independence of each cell.\n\nD. Only Tracer B will spread to adjacent cells, as gap junctions form pores with a specific size exclusion limit that allows small molecules to pass but blocks larger macromolecules like proteins.\n\nE. The outcome is unpredictable without knowing the specific connexin isoform, as some isoforms allow large proteins to pass while others block small molecules.", "solution": "The key physical structure is the gap junction channel formed by paired connexons (connexin hexamers) that create an aqueous pore directly connecting the cytoplasm of adjacent cells. Transport of solutes through gap junctions is by passive diffusion, not by active transport. A central biophysical property of these pores is a size- and charge-dependent permeability with an effective size exclusion limit: small ions and metabolites pass readily, while large macromolecules, particularly proteins, are excluded.\n\nLet the pore have an effective radius $a$, and a solute have Stokes (hydrodynamic) radius $r_{s}$. A necessary condition for permeation is $r_{s}<a$; if $r_{s}\\ge a$, steric exclusion yields negligible permeability. Denote the permeability for a solute as $P(r_{s},q)$, which depends on $r_{s}$ and charge $q$. For a given concentration difference $\\Delta C$ across the junctional pore and area $A$, the diffusive flux is given by Fick’s law:\n$$\nJ=-P\\,A\\,\\Delta C.\n$$\nThus, if $P=0$ (or effectively zero) due to steric exclusion, then $J=0$ and no intercellular spread occurs, regardless of the concentration gradient or time allowed. Conversely, if $P>0$, then $J\\ne 0$ and, over time $t$, the solute will redistribute into coupled neighbors until concentrations equilibrate.\n\nApply this to the two tracers:\n1) Tracer A is a fluorescent protein with molecular mass $M_{A}=29\\,\\text{kDa}$. Proteins of this size have $r_{s}$ far exceeding the effective gap junction pore radius for connexin-based channels; therefore $r_{s,A}\\ge a$ and $P_{A}\\approx 0$. Substituting into Fick’s law yields $J_{A}=0$, so no spread into neighboring cells is expected. Moreover, genetic expression in one cell does not generate any active transport across gap junctions; movement through gap junctions remains passive and size-limited.\n\n2) Tracer B is a small fluorescent dye with molecular mass $M_{B}=0.4\\,\\text{kDa}$. Such small molecules typically have $r_{s,B}<a$ for connexin pores, so $P_{B}>0$, implying $J_{B}\\ne 0$ and allowing diffusion into neighboring coupled cells. Given a finite diffusion coefficient and nonzero $P_{B}$, allowing time on the order of tens of minutes is sufficient to observe detectable spread in a coupled syncytium.\n\nEvaluate the options in light of the above:\n- A is false because mere presence of a channel is not sufficient; permeability is size- and charge-selective, and large proteins do not pass.\n- B is false because there is no active, expression-driven intercellular transport through gap junctions; transport is passive and size-limited.\n- C is false because connexin-based gap junctions in the CNS do permit passage of ions and small metabolites, enabling electrical and metabolic coupling.\n- D is correct because only the small dye is within the size limit and will diffuse; the protein is excluded.\n- E is false because, although connexin isoforms differ in selectivity, none permit passage of large proteins while small dyes commonly permeate.\n\nTherefore, only Tracer B will spread to adjacent cells due to the size-exclusion property of gap junction pores.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2332262"}, {"introduction": "The flow of ions through gap junctions creates electrical synapses, which are crucial for synchronizing neuronal activity.
