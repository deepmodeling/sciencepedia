This first exercise explores the most fundamental aspect of this process: the link between the concentration of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) outside the neuron and the resulting strength of the postsynaptic signal. By analyzing a hypothetical scenario where extracellular calcium is reduced, you will solidify your understanding of why $Ca^{2+}$ is the key trigger for vesicle fusion and how its availability directly dictates synaptic efficacy ([@problem_id:2354637]).", "problem": "A neuroscientist is studying a glutamatergic synapse in a central nervous system culture. In the initial control experiment, a single action potential is induced in the presynaptic neuron, and the resulting depolarization in the postsynaptic neuron, known as an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP), is recorded. The experiment is then repeated under a new condition where the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in the extracellular solution bathing the synapse is reduced to 10% of its original physiological value. All other parameters, including the properties of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons and the resting membrane potentials, are held constant.\n\nAssuming all other factors remain ideal, which of the following outcomes is the most direct and significant consequence of reducing the extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ concentration on the postsynaptic response to a single presynaptic action potential?\n\nA. The amplitude of the presynaptic action potential will decrease.\n\nB. The EPSP will be converted into an Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP).\n\nC. The amount of neurotransmitter released per action potential will increase, leading to a larger EPSP.\n\nD. The amplitude of the EPSP will significantly decrease.\n\nE. The duration of the EPSP will increase, but its amplitude will remain unchanged.", "solution": "The postsynaptic EPSP amplitude produced by a single presynaptic action potential can be expressed as proportional to the quantal content times the quantal size, with the latter determined by postsynaptic receptor properties:\n$$A_{\\text{EPSP}} \\propto m q, \\quad m = N p$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of readily releasable vesicles and $p$ is the release probability. Holding postsynaptic properties constant leaves $q$ unchanged, so changes in $A_{\\text{EPSP}}$ arise from $m$, specifically from $p$.\n\nThe release probability $p$ depends steeply and cooperatively on the presynaptic intracellular calcium concentration near release sites during the action potential, commonly modeled as:\n$$p \\propto [\\text{Ca}]_{i}^{n}$$\nwith $n$ typically in the range $3$ to $4$. The action potential waveform in the presynaptic neuron is primarily determined by voltage-gated $\\text{Na}^{+}$ and $\\text{K}^{+}$ channels, so its amplitude is not directly reduced by changing extracellular $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration under the stated conditions.\n\nPresynaptic calcium entry during the action potential is governed by the calcium current:\n$$I_{\\text{Ca}}(t) = g_{\\text{Ca}}(t)\\,\\big(V_{m}(t) - E_{\\text{Ca}}\\big)$$\nwith the Nernst potential for calcium:\n$$E_{\\text{Ca}} = \\frac{RT}{2F} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[\\text{Ca}]_{o}}{[\\text{Ca}]_{i}}\\right)$$\nReducing $[\\text{Ca}]_{o}$ decreases $E_{\\text{Ca}}$ and thus reduces the driving force $\\big(V_{m} - E_{\\text{Ca}}\\big)$ for inward calcium current at the same membrane potential $V_{m}$, thereby reducing the time-integrated calcium influx and the peak $[\\text{Ca}]_{i}$ transient that triggers vesicle fusion.

This practice investigates how the shape of the presynaptic action potential controls the timing of calcium entry. By considering the effects of a toxin that broadens the action potential, you will learn how the interplay between different ion channels can precisely modulate the calcium signal and, consequently, the strength of the synapse ([@problem_id:2354664]).", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating synaptic transmission at a presynaptic nerve terminal. The membrane of this terminal contains three key types of ion channels: voltage-gated sodium ($Na^{+}$) channels that mediate the rising phase of the action potential, voltage-gated potassium ($K^{+}$) channels that are primarily responsible for the rapid repolarization (falling phase), and voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). The VGCCs open in response to the depolarization caused by an action potential, allowing calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) to enter the terminal and trigger the release of neurotransmitters.\n\nIn an experiment, the neuroscientist applies dendrotoxin, a neurotoxin known to specifically and completely block the voltage-gated $K^{+}$ channels. After the application of the toxin, a single action potential is initiated and arrives at the presynaptic terminal.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the effect of dendrotoxin on the total influx of $Ca^{2+}$ through the VGCCs during this single action potential event, as compared to a normal action potential without the toxin?\n\nA. The total $Ca^{2+}$ influx will decrease because the failure of the action potential to repolarize correctly prevents the VGCCs from resetting for subsequent activation.\n\nB. The total $Ca^{2+}$ influx will increase because the presynaptic membrane remains depolarized for a longer duration, holding the VGCCs in an open state for a longer time.\n\nC. There will be no change in the total $Ca^{2+}$ influx because the dendrotoxin does not directly bind to or affect the VGCCs.\n\nD. The influx of $Ca^{2+}$ will be completely prevented because the block of $K^{+}$ channels disrupts the membrane potential in a way that stops the VGCCs from opening.\n\nE. The total $Ca^{2+}$ influx will increase because the toxin directly binds to and potentiates the opening of the VGCCs.", "solution": "We analyze how blocking voltage-gated potassium channels alters the time course of the presynaptic action potential and, consequently, the total calcium entry through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) during a single action potential.\n\nFirst, write the membrane current balance for the presynaptic terminal using the standard capacitive equation:\n$$C_{m}\\,\\frac{dV}{dt}=-\\left(I_{Na}+I_{K}+I_{Ca}+I_{\\text{leak}}\\right)$$\nwhere $C_{m}$ is the membrane capacitance, $V(t)$ is the membrane potential, and $I_{Na}$, $I_{K}$, $I_{Ca}$, $I_{\\text{leak}}$ are the sodium, potassium, calcium, and leak currents, respectively. In normal conditions, rapid activation of $I_{Na}$ drives the upstroke, and activation of $I_{K}$ produces the rapid repolarization (falling phase).\n\nDendrotoxin specifically blocks voltage-gated $K^{+}$ channels, which effectively sets $I_{K}\\approx 0$ during the action potential. Substituting this condition gives:\n$$C_{m}\\,\\frac{dV}{dt}=-\\left(I_{Na}+I_{Ca}+I_{\\text{leak}}\\right)$$\nBecause the major outward repolarizing current is removed, the repolarization phase is slowed and the action potential duration is prolonged. This is equivalent to an action potential broadening, i.e., $V(t)$ remains in a depolarized range for a longer time interval than under control conditions.\n\nNext, express the calcium current through VGCCs as a conductance-based current:\n$$I_{Ca}(t)=g_{Ca}(V,t)\\,\\big(V(t)-E_{Ca}\\big)$$\nwhere $g_{Ca}(V,t)$ encodes the maximal conductance scaled by the open probability of VGCCs, and $E_{Ca}$ is the calcium reversal potential. For presynaptic depolarizations during an action potential, one has $E_{Ca}>V(t)$ at all relevant times, so $V(t)-E_{Ca}<0$ and $I_{Ca}(t)$ is inward. The magnitude of inward calcium current can be written as:\n$$|I_{Ca}(t)|=g_{Ca}(V,t)\\,\\big(E_{Ca}-V(t)\\big)$$\nwith $g_{Ca}(V,t)$ increasing when $V(t)$ is depolarized, due to voltage-dependent gating of VGCCs.\n\nThe total calcium influx during the single action potential is proportional to the time integral of the inward calcium current. Denote the total inward calcium charge entry as:\n$$Q_{Ca}=\\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} |I_{Ca}(t)|\\,dt=\\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} g_{Ca}(V,t)\\,\\big(E_{Ca}-V(t)\\big)\\,dt$$\nover the duration of the action potential from $t_{0}$ to $t_{1}$. Because dendrotoxin prolongs depolarization, two effects increase the integral:\n1) The open probability of VGCCs, and thus $g_{Ca}(V,t)$, remains elevated for a longer time.\n2) The integration interval over which $V(t)$ is depolarized and $g_{Ca}$ is high is extended.\n\nSince $E_{Ca}-V(t)>0$ during the action potential and $g_{Ca}(V,t)$ remains high for longer due to the prolonged depolarization, it follows that:\n$$Q_{Ca}^{\\text{toxin}}=\\int |I_{Ca}^{\\text{toxin}}(t)|\\,dt>\\int |I_{Ca}^{\\text{control}}(t)|\\,dt=Q_{Ca}^{\\text{control}}$$\nTherefore, the total $Ca^{2+}$ influx during the single action potential increases.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- A is incorrect because the assertion concerns failure to reset for subsequent activation, which is irrelevant to the total influx during the single action potential; moreover, channel resetting affects future spikes, not the ongoing one.\n- B is correct: blocking $I_{K}$ prolongs depolarization, keeping VGCCs open longer and increasing the time integral of calcium current.\n- C is incorrect because, although dendrotoxin does not bind VGCCs, it indirectly increases their open time by altering the action potential waveform.\n- D is incorrect because VGCCs still open in response to depolarization; $K^{+}$ channel block does not prevent their activation.\n- E is incorrect because dendrotoxin does not directly potentiate VGCCs.\n\nThus, the most accurate description is that the total $Ca^{2+}$ influx increases due to prolonged depolarization holding VGCCs open longer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2354664"}, {"introduction": "The relationship between calcium influx and vesicle release is not a simple one-to-one correspondence; it is a highly cooperative process where multiple calcium ions are thought to be required to trigger the fusion of a single vesicle.

The quantal content ($m$), which represents the average number of vesicles released per action potential, is well-described by the power-law model:\n$$m \\propto [Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{peak}}^n$$\nHere, $[Ca^{2+}]_{\\text{peak}}$ is the peak intracellular calcium concentration achieved near the vesicle release sites during an action potential, and $n$ is the cooperativity coefficient.
