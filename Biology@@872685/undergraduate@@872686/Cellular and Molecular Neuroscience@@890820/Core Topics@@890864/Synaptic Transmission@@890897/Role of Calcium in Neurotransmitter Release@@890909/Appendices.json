This first practice problem simulates a classic experimental approach using a calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye to directly visualize the influx of calcium into the presynaptic terminal. By predicting the outcome, you will solidify the fundamental link between the arrival of an electrical action potential and the resulting chemical signal that initiates release.", "problem": "An experimental neuroscientist is studying synaptic transmission at a chemical synapse. The scientist injects a specialized fluorescent dye into the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron. This dye has a key property: its fluorescence intensity increases significantly when it binds to free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$). The neuron is initially at its resting membrane potential. The extracellular fluid surrounding the neuron has a much higher concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ than the intracellular fluid. The presynaptic terminal membrane is known to contain a high density of voltage-gated calcium channels.\n\nThe scientist then stimulates the axon, causing a single action potential to propagate and arrive at the presynaptic terminal. An instrument is used to measure the total fluorescence from the dye within the terminal.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes best describes the change in fluorescence measured from the presynaptic terminal *immediately* following the arrival of the action potential?\n\nA. A rapid increase in fluorescence.\n\nB. A rapid decrease in fluorescence.\n\nC. No change in fluorescence.\n\nD. A slow, gradual increase in fluorescence over several seconds.", "solution": "The dye’s fluorescence increases when it binds free $Ca^{2+}$, so the measured fluorescence is a monotonic function of the intracellular free calcium concentration $[Ca^{2+}]_{i}$. At rest, $[Ca^{2+}]_{o} \\gg [Ca^{2+}]_{i}$, so the Nernst potential for calcium is\n$$\nE_{Ca} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[Ca^{2+}]_{o}}{[Ca^{2+}]_{i}}\\right),\n$$\nwith $z=2$, implying $E_{Ca}$ is large and positive. When the action potential arrives, it depolarizes the presynaptic terminal membrane and opens voltage-gated calcium channels, rapidly increasing the calcium conductance $g_{Ca}$. The calcium current is given by Ohm’s law for ionic currents,\n$$\nI_{Ca} = g_{Ca}\\,(V - E_{Ca}),\n$$\nand since during the action potential $V \\ll E_{Ca}$, the driving force $V - E_{Ca}$ is negative, producing an inward $Ca^{2+}$ current and a rapid influx of $Ca^{2+}$. This influx causes a rapid rise in $[Ca^{2+}]_{i}$ on the millisecond timescale. Because the dye’s fluorescence intensity increases upon binding $Ca^{2+}$, the total fluorescence measured from the terminal will increase promptly following channel opening. Subsequent clearance by pumps and buffers leads to a decay, but the immediate effect following the action potential is a rapid increase, not a decrease, no change, nor a slow change over several seconds.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2349900"}, {"introduction": "Having established that an action potential triggers calcium influx, we can now ask a more quantitative question: what is the precise relationship between the concentration of calcium and the amount of neurotransmitter released? This exercise introduces the critical concept of cooperativity, where multiple calcium ions must act together to trigger a single fusion event. By analyzing hypothetical experimental data ([@problem_id:2349899]), you will calculate this cooperativity, gaining insight into the molecular mechanism of the calcium sensor.", "problem": "At the presynaptic terminal of a neuron, the influx of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) through voltage-gated channels triggers the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the cell membrane, leading to neurotransmitter release. The relationship between the extracellular calcium concentration, $[Ca^{2+}]_o$, and the average number of vesicles released per action potential, known as the quantal content ($m$), can be approximated by a power-law relationship:\n\n$$m = K \\cdot ([Ca^{2+}]_o)^{n}$$\n\nHere, $K$ is a proportionality constant that depends on various factors at the synapse, and the exponent $n$ represents the cooperativity of calcium action. This value, $n$, corresponds to the number of calcium ions that must bind to a molecular sensor to trigger the fusion of a single vesicle.\n\nIn an experiment on a specific neuromuscular junction, a researcher first measures the quantal content in a standard physiological solution. Then, the researcher replaces the solution with one where the extracellular calcium concentration is reduced to exactly half of its original value. This change is observed to cause the quantal content to decrease to $\\frac{1}{16}$ of its original value.\n\nBased on these experimental results, determine the value of the cooperativity coefficient, $n$.", "solution": "The problem provides the relationship between the quantal content ($m$), the extracellular calcium concentration ($[Ca^{2+}]_o$), and the cooperativity coefficient ($n$):\n$$m = K \\cdot ([Ca^{2+}]_o)^{n}$$\nwhere $K$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nLet the initial conditions be denoted by the subscript 1 and the final conditions by the subscript 2.\nThe initial quantal content is $m_1$ at an initial extracellular calcium concentration of $[Ca^{2+}]_{o,1}$. The relationship is:\n$$m_1 = K \\cdot ([Ca^{2+}]_{o,1})^{n}$$\n\nIn the second part of the experiment, the extracellular calcium concentration is halved. So, the new concentration is:\n$$[Ca^{2+}]_{o,2} = \\frac{1}{2} [Ca^{2+}]_{o,1}$$\nThis change causes the quantal content to decrease to $\\frac{1}{16}$ of its original value. The new quantal content is:\n$$m_2 = \\frac{1}{16} m_1$$\nThe relationship for the final conditions is:\n$$m_2 = K \\cdot ([Ca^{2+}]_{o,2})^{n}$$\n\nTo find the value of $n$, we can take the ratio of the final equation to the initial equation.

This final practice problem challenges you to dissect their roles using specific pharmacological tools that target each component separately.

In this preparation, they can stimulate the presynaptic axon to trigger an action potential and measure the resulting Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials (EPSPs) in the postsynaptic neuron. They can also record spontaneous, miniature Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials (mEPSPs), which represent the release of single synaptic vesicles and occur without any presynaptic stimulation.\n\nThe core machinery for vesicle fusion is the Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein Receptor (SNARE) complex. The arrival of an action potential at the presynaptic terminal depolarizes the membrane, opening voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and causing a large influx of Ca$^{2+}$. This Ca$^{2+}$ signal is the primary trigger for the SNARE complex to mediate synchronous vesicle fusion, leading to the EPSP.\n\nThe researcher conducts two separate experiments. In Experiment 1, they apply Tetanus Toxin (TeNT), a potent neurotoxin that acts as a protease to cleave a critical protein within the SNARE complex, rendering it non-functional. In Experiment 2, on a fresh preparation, they apply a highly specific blocker that irreversibly inhibits all presynaptic VGCCs.\n\nBased on the known mechanisms of neurotransmitter release, which of the following outcomes correctly describes the effects of these two agents on evoked EPSPs and spontaneous mEPSPs?\n\nA. TeNT will block EPSPs but not mEPSPs. The VGCC blocker will block both EPSPs and mEPSPs.\n\nB. TeNT will block both EPSPs and mEPSPs. The VGCC blocker will block EPSPs but not mEPSPs.\n\nC.

TeNT will block EPSPs but not mEPSPs. The VGCC blocker will block mEPSPs but not EPSPs.", "solution": "We begin from the mechanistic requirements for synaptic vesicle fusion:\n1) Vesicle fusion requires an intact SNARE complex. If the v-SNARE (synaptobrevin/VAMP) or other essential SNARE component is cleaved or rendered nonfunctional, the fusion rate goes to zero for any trigger. Symbolically, if we denote the fusion rate by $R_{\\text{fusion}}$ and SNARE integrity by an indicator $S$ with $S=1$ for intact and $S=0$ for cleaved, then\n$$\nR_{\\text{fusion}} \\propto S \\times P_{r},\n$$\nso if $S=0$ (e.g., after TeNT), then $R_{\\text{fusion}}=0$ for both evoked release and spontaneous release.\n\n2) Evoked release is triggered by action potential opening of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), producing a large, local increase in calcium concentration near release sites. The probability of evoked release depends nonlinearly on calcium:\n$$\nP_{r}^{\\text{evoked}} \\propto \\left([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{local}}\\right)^{n},\n$$\nwith $n>1$, and $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{local}}$ elevated by VGCC-mediated influx during the action potential.\n\n3) Spontaneous miniature release (mEPSPs) occurs in the absence of presynaptic stimulation and does not require opening of VGCCs. Minis are SNARE-dependent vesicle fusion events that occur at basal calcium levels and persist even when VGCCs are blocked or when extracellular calcium is removed. Thus\n$$\nP_{r}^{\\text{mini}} \\text{ exists at basal } [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] \\text{ and does not require VGCC opening.}\n$$\n\nNow apply the two manipulations:\n\nA) Tetanus toxin (TeNT) cleaves a critical SNARE protein (synaptobrevin/VAMP), rendering the SNARE complex nonfunctional.
