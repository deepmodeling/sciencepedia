This first practice problem provides a direct calculation to solidify this concept. By using the experimentally measured miniature endplate potential (mEPP) as the fundamental unit, you will determine how many of these quanta sum together to create a full endplate potential (EPP) [@problem_id:2335459].", "problem": "At the neuromuscular junction, the arrival of a nerve impulse triggers the release of acetylcholine from synaptic vesicles into the synaptic cleft. The binding of acetylcholine to receptors on the muscle fiber's membrane generates a depolarization known as an Endplate Potential (EPP). Even in the absence of a nerve impulse, single vesicles can spontaneously fuse with the presynaptic membrane, releasing their contents and causing a much smaller depolarization called a Miniature Endplate Potential (mEPP). The mEPP is considered the fundamental unit, or quantum, of neurotransmitter release.\n\nIn a laboratory experiment on a frog neuromuscular junction, a researcher records the postsynaptic potentials. She finds that the average depolarization caused by a single, spontaneously released vesicle (the mEPP) is 0.5 mV. When she stimulates the presynaptic motor neuron with a single electrical pulse, she observes a resulting EPP with an amplitude of 30 mV.\n\nAssuming that each vesicle contains roughly the same amount of acetylcholine and that the postsynaptic response to each quantum sums linearly, calculate the number of acetylcholine vesicles released by the single nerve impulse to generate the observed EPP.", "solution": "The quantal hypothesis and linear summation assume each vesicle release produces an identical postsynaptic depolarization (a quantum) and the endplate potential sums these quanta linearly.

Changes in the amplitude of mEPPs (quantal size) point to different molecular targets than changes in their frequency of occurrence. This problem challenges you to work backward from physiological observations to deduce the presynaptic mechanisms of two hypothetical toxins, reinforcing your understanding of what controls vesicle filling versus vesicle fusion [@problem_id:2335494].", "problem": "A team of neuropharmacologists is investigating the effects of two novel toxins, Toxin P and Toxin Q, on synaptic transmission at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction. They use intracellular microelectrodes to record from a muscle fiber in the absence of nerve stimulation. They observe the spontaneous appearance of miniature Endplate Potentials (mEPPs), which are small, spontaneous depolarizations of the postsynaptic membrane, each resulting from the release of a single quantum (one vesicle's worth) of Acetylcholine (ACh).\n\nFirst, they establish a baseline recording. Then, they apply Toxin P to the preparation and observe that the frequency of mEPPs increases by a factor of five, while the average amplitude of individual mEPPs remains unchanged. After washing out Toxin P, they apply Toxin Q. With Toxin Q, they find that the frequency of mEPPs is unchanged from the baseline, but the average amplitude of each mEPP is approximately doubled.\n\nBoth toxins are known to act exclusively on presynaptic targets. Based on these observations, which of the following options presents the most plausible primary molecular mechanism for Toxin P and Toxin Q?\n\nA. **Toxin P:** Enhances the activity of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). **Toxin Q:** Acts as a weak calcium ionophore, slightly increasing resting presynaptic intracellular Ca2+ concentration.\n\nB. **Toxin P:** Blocks presynaptic voltage-gated potassium channels. **Toxin Q:** Inhibits the high-affinity choline transporter responsible for choline reuptake.\n\nC. **Toxin P:** Acts as a weak calcium ionophore, slightly increasing resting presynaptic intracellular Ca2+ concentration. **Toxin Q:** Enhances the activity of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT).\n\nD. **Toxin P:** Inhibits the enzyme acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft. **Toxin Q:** Acts as an allosteric modulator that increases the affinity of postsynaptic ACh receptors.", "solution": "Define the standard quantal parameters of spontaneous transmission at the neuromuscular junction: the mEPP amplitude equals the quantal size $q$ (amount of acetylcholine per vesicle times postsynaptic receptor response), and the mEPP frequency $f$ reflects the spontaneous vesicle fusion rate. The quantal hypothesis states that $q$ is set by vesicle filling and postsynaptic sensitivity, while $f$ depends on presynaptic release machinery and, in particular, on basal presynaptic $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$, with $P_{\\text{fusion}} \\propto [\\text{Ca}^{2+}]^{n}$ for some $n>1$.\n\nFrom the observations:\n1) With Toxin P: the frequency increases by a factor of five while the amplitude is unchanged. In symbols, if baseline is $(q,f)$, then with Toxin P we have $(q_{P},f_{P})=(q,5f)$. Unchanged $q$ implies no change in vesicle content or postsynaptic receptor sensitivity. The increase in $f$ implies an increased spontaneous fusion probability, which is most parsimoniously explained by a rise in resting presynaptic $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$. A weak $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ ionophore would increase basal presynaptic $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ and thereby increase $f$ without affecting $q$.\n\n2) With Toxin Q: the frequency is unchanged while the amplitude approximately doubles. In symbols, $(q_{Q},f_{Q})=(2q,f)$. Unchanged $f$ indicates no change in the spontaneous fusion probability. A doubled $q$ indicates an increased quantal size, which—given the constraint of exclusively presynaptic actions—must arise from increased vesicle filling with acetylcholine. Enhancing the activity of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) increases the amount of acetylcholine loaded per vesicle, thereby increasing $q$ without changing $f$.\n\nEvaluate the options against these deductions and the explicit constraint that both toxins act exclusively presynaptically:\n- Option A: Enhancing VAChT for Toxin P would increase $q$ (amplitude), not $f$; the weak $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ ionophore for Toxin Q would increase $f$, not $q$. This contradicts both observed patterns.\n- Option B: Blocking presynaptic voltage-gated potassium channels affects action potential repolarization but, in the absence of nerve stimulation, would not appropriately elevate spontaneous release; moreover, inhibiting the high-affinity choline transporter would reduce acetylcholine synthesis and vesicle filling, tending to decrease $q$, not increase it.\n- Option C: Toxin P as a weak $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ ionophore explains $f\\uparrow$ with $q$ unchanged; Toxin Q enhancing VAChT explains $q\\uparrow$ with $f$ unchanged. This matches both observations and the presynaptic-only constraint.\n- Option D: Acetylcholinesterase inhibition and postsynaptic receptor allosteric modulation are not presynaptic mechanisms; furthermore, these would alter mEPP amplitude/duration via non-presynaptic routes, violating the stated constraint.\n\nTherefore, the only option consistent with all data and constraints is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2335494"}, {"introduction": "Synapses are dynamic, and their strength can change with patterns of activity—a phenomenon known as synaptic plasticity.

Synaptic depression, a form of short-term synaptic plasticity, is the activity-dependent reduction in synaptic strength. Two primary hypotheses are considered for the depression observed after a high-frequency train of stimuli (tetanus):\n1.  **Presynaptic Fatigue**: The depletion of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles and a slow rate of mobilization from the reserve pool, leading to a decrease in the number of vesicles released per action potential.\n2.  **Postsynaptic Desensitization**: A reduction in the responsiveness of postsynaptic nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors (nAChRs) to acetylcholine.\n\nTo distinguish between these possibilities, the researcher records intracellularly from a muscle fiber. They measure the average amplitude of the evoked Endplate Potential (EPP), which results from a single stimulus to the motor nerve, and the average amplitude of spontaneously occurring miniature Endplate Potentials (mEPPs), which result from the release of single synaptic vesicles.\n\nThese measurements are taken under two conditions: a control condition and immediately following a strong tetanic stimulation (100 Hz for 20 seconds) that induces significant depression.\n\nThe experimental data are as follows:\n-   **Control Condition**:\n    -   Average EPP Amplitude: $45.0$ mV\n    -   Average mEPP Amplitude: $0.75$ mV\n-   **Post-Tetanus Condition**:\n    -   Average EPP Amplitude: $9.0$ mV\n    -   Average mEPP Amplitude: $0.74$ mV\n\nIn quantal analysis, the quantal size ($q$) represents the postsynaptic response to a single vesicle (i.e., the mEPP amplitude), while the quantal content ($m$) is the average number of vesicles released by an action potential.
