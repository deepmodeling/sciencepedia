They are investigating how a specific experimental condition affects the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Using an intracellular microelectrode placed in a postsynaptic muscle cell, they perform two types of measurements.\n\nFirst, by stimulating the presynaptic motor nerve, they evoke a large depolarization in the muscle cell. This response is called the End-Plate Potential (EPP). The average amplitude of the EPPs recorded under their experimental setup is 27.6 mV.\n\nSecond, in the absence of any stimulation to the motor nerve, they record small, spontaneous fluctuations in the muscle cell's membrane potential. These are known as miniature End-Plate Potentials (mEPPs), which are understood to be the postsynaptic response to the release of a single quantum (one synaptic vesicle's worth) of acetylcholine. The mean amplitude of the observed mEPPs is 0.46 mV.\n\nAssuming the quantal hypothesis, which states that an EPP is the sum of many individual quantal events, calculate the quantal content for this synapse under these conditions. The quantal content is defined as the average number of vesicles released from the presynaptic terminal in response to a single nerve impulse.", "solution": "Under the quantal hypothesis, the mean End-Plate Potential (EPP) amplitude equals the product of the quantal content and the mean miniature EPP (mEPP) amplitude. Denoting the quantal content by $m$, the mean EPP amplitude by $\\langle A_{\\mathrm{EPP}}\\rangle$, and the mean mEPP amplitude (quantal size) by $q=\\langle A_{\\mathrm{mEPP}}\\rangle$, we have:\n$$\n\\langle A_{\\mathrm{EPP}}\\rangle = m\\,q \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad m = \\frac{\\langle A_{\\mathrm{EPP}}\\rangle}{q}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values, with units canceling:\n$$\nm = \\frac{27.6\\ \\mathrm{mV}}{0.46\\ \\mathrm{mV}} = \\frac{27.6}{0.46}.\n$$\nCompute the ratio explicitly:\n$$\n\\frac{27.6}{0.46} = \\frac{2760}{46} = 60.\n$$\nThus, the quantal content is $60$ vesicles per nerve impulse.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{60}$$", "id": "2353164"}, {"introduction": "Synaptic vesicle fusion can be either spontaneous or triggered by an action potential, and understanding the difference is key to deciphering neurotransmission. This exercise, based on classic experimental observations, explores the critical role of calcium ions in distinguishing between these two modes of release. By considering why spontaneous mEPPs persist even when evoked EPPs are abolished in a calcium-free environment, you can deduce the fundamental mechanism that makes evoked release a rapid and reliable signaling process [@problem_id:2353156].", "problem": "An electrophysiologist is investigating the mechanisms of neurotransmitter release at the frog neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a model synapse. In the first phase of the experiment, the NMJ is bathed in a standard Ringer's solution containing a physiological concentration of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$). When the presynaptic motor neuron is electrically stimulated, a large depolarizing potential, known as the end-plate potential (EPP), is recorded in the postsynaptic muscle fiber. In the absence of stimulation, small, spontaneous depolarizations of a consistent amplitude, called miniature end-plate potentials (mEPPs), are also observed.\n\nIn the second phase of the experiment, the standard Ringer's solution is replaced with a solution that is nominally free of $Ca^{2+}$ and contains EGTA, a chemical that chelates (binds to) any residual free $Ca^{2+}$ ions. After this change, electrical stimulation of the motor neuron no longer produces any EPPs. However, the spontaneous mEPPs continue to occur, albeit at a potentially altered frequency.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate biophysical explanation for the persistence of mEPPs in a calcium-free extracellular medium?\n\nA. In the absence of extracellular calcium, the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors become hypersensitive and begin to open stochastically, generating potentials that are indistinguishable from mEPPs.\n\nB. The presynaptic terminal contains large internal stores of calcium within the endoplasmic reticulum, which are automatically released to trigger single vesicle fusion events when extracellular calcium is absent.\n\nC. The spontaneous fusion of a single synaptic vesicle with the presynaptic membrane is a low-probability, stochastic event that can occur with basal intracellular calcium concentrations and does not depend on the large, rapid influx of extracellular calcium that is required for evoked, multi-vesicular release.\n\nD. In a calcium-free solution, the presynaptic action potential is still generated but is only strong enough to trigger the release of a single vesicle, resulting in an mEPP instead of a full EPP.\n\nE. The machinery for vesicle fusion can use magnesium ions ($Mg^{2+}$) as a substitute for calcium ions. In a calcium-free environment, the physiological concentration of magnesium is sufficient to sustain the low rate of spontaneous release responsible for mEPPs.", "solution": "We apply the quantal hypothesis and calcium-triggered exocytosis. In physiological extracellular calcium, a presynaptic action potential opens voltage-gated calcium channels, causing a rapid local increase of intracellular calcium concentration $[Ca^{2+}]_{i}$ near release sites. Vesicle fusion is triggered by calcium binding to the fusion sensor (e.g., synaptotagmin), producing multivesicular release and a large end-plate potential. In the quantal model, the mean EPP amplitude satisfies\n$$\nA = n\\,p\\,q,\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of functional release sites, $p$ is the probability of release per site per action potential, and $q$ is the quantal size (the amplitude of a miniature end-plate potential, mEPP). The steep calcium dependence of evoked release can be expressed as $p \\propto [Ca^{2+}]_{i}^{m}$, with $m>1$ (classically $m\\approx 3 \\text{ to } 4$), reflecting cooperative calcium binding.\n\nWhen extracellular calcium is removed and residual $Ca^{2+}$ is chelated by EGTA, an invading action potential may still open presynaptic calcium channels, but there is no significant calcium influx because $[Ca^{2+}]_{o}\\approx 0$, so the rapid local rise in $[Ca^{2+}]_{i}$ does not occur. Consequently $p$ for evoked release becomes effectively zero, and thus\n$$\nA = n\\,p\\,q \\to 0,\n$$\neliminating evoked EPPs.\n\nHowever, spontaneous mEPPs persist because single-vesicle fusion is a low-probability, stochastic process that can occur at basal $[Ca^{2+}]_{i}$ without requiring the large, rapid calcium microdomain created by an action potential. A minimal kinetic description of spontaneous fusion rate $\\lambda_{\\text{spon}}$ is that it is thermally activated with a calcium-dependent energy barrier $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{spon}} \\sim \\lambda_{0}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}([Ca^{2+}]_{i})}{k_{B}T}\\right),\n$$\nso that even at resting $[Ca^{2+}]_{i}$ the rate is finite, yielding occasional single-vesicle release events whose postsynaptic effect is the mEPP. Removal of extracellular calcium reduces evoked $p$ to near zero and often lowers $\\lambda_{\\text{spon}}$, but does not eliminate it, so mEPPs remain observable.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n\nA is incorrect because nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are ligand-gated and require acetylcholine binding; they do not open stochastically in the absence of ligand to produce quantal mEPPs. mEPPs are abolished by postsynaptic antagonists, showing they arise from quantal acetylcholine release, not spontaneous receptor openings.\n\nB is incorrect because internal calcium stores are not “automatically released” when extracellular calcium is removed, nor are they required to generate the low-rate, single-vesicle spontaneous fusion events observed as mEPPs.\n\nC is correct: spontaneous single-vesicle fusion is a low-probability, stochastic process that can occur at basal $[Ca^{2+}]_{i}$ and does not require the large, rapid influx of extracellular calcium that drives evoked, multivesicular release.\n\nD is incorrect because, in the absence of extracellular calcium, an action potential does not produce the necessary calcium influx; therefore it does not reliably trigger even single-vesicle evoked release.\n\nE is incorrect because the exocytotic calcium sensor is highly selective for $Ca^{2+}$; physiological $Mg^{2+}$ does not substitute to sustain calcium-sensor–mediated fusion. Indeed, $Mg^{2+}$ generally does not trigger synaptotagmin-dependent release and can screen charges, reducing release probability.\n\nTherefore, the persistence of mEPPs in zero extracellular calcium is best explained by spontaneous, calcium-independent or weakly calcium-dependent single-vesicle fusion occurring at basal intracellular calcium levels, as stated in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2353156"}, {"introduction": "Synapses are not static transmitters; their efficacy changes dynamically depending on their recent history of activity, a property known as short-term plasticity.
