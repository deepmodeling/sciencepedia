{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is not a random process of membrane engulfment; it is a highly specific mechanism for internalizing selected cargo. This specificity is achieved through the interaction between sorting signals on the cargo proteins and adaptor protein complexes in the coat. This exercise [@problem_id:2331475] challenges you to predict the consequences of breaking this crucial link, illustrating the foundational principle of cargo recognition in initiating vesicle formation.", "problem": "A developmental neurobiologist is studying iron uptake in cultured neurons. Iron is essential for neuronal function and is taken up from the extracellular environment via the Transferrin Receptor (TfR). This process is mediated by Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis (CME), where receptors on the cell surface are recognized and internalized into vesicles. The recognition step is critical and involves an adaptor protein complex, AP-2, binding to a specific amino acid sequence in the cytoplasmic tail of the TfR. This sequence is a well-characterized tyrosine-based sorting signal.\n\nThe neurobiologist genetically engineers a line of neurons to express a mutant form of the TfR. This mutation specifically deletes the tyrosine-based sorting signal from the receptor's cytoplasmic tail but leaves the rest of the receptor, including its extracellular ligand-binding domain, intact and functional. These mutant neurons are then cultured in a medium containing a high concentration of iron-bound transferrin, the ligand for TfR, to stimulate receptor internalization.\n\nBased on your understanding of cellular trafficking, which of the following outcomes best describes the predominant location of the mutant TfR protein after a sustained period of stimulation with its ligand?\n\nA. The receptors will predominantly remain on the plasma membrane.\n\nB. The receptors will be rapidly internalized and concentrated in clathrin-coated vesicles.\n\nC. The receptors will be targeted for degradation and accumulate in lysosomes.\n\nD. The receptors will be retrieved from the cell surface and accumulate in the Golgi apparatus.\n\nE. The receptors will be internalized at a normal rate via a clathrin-independent pathway.", "solution": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) requires cargo selection by the adaptor protein AP-2, which recognizes tyrosine-based sorting signals of the form $Yxx\\Phi$ in the cytosolic tails of receptors. The Transferrin Receptor (TfR) is a canonical CME cargo whose internalization depends on this $Yxx\\Phi$ motif; the $\\mu_2$ subunit of AP-2 binds the motif, recruiting TfR into clathrin-coated pits.\n\nIn the engineered mutant, the tyrosine-based sorting signal is deleted while the extracellular ligand-binding domain remains intact. Ligand (transferrin) binding does not substitute for the cytosolic sorting information required for AP-2 engagement. Therefore, without the $Yxx\\Phi$ motif, AP-2 cannot bind the TfR cytosolic tail, and the receptor is not efficiently recruited into clathrin-coated pits. Consequently, the clathrin-dependent internalization rate is markedly reduced relative to wild type.\n\nThe steady-state distribution of receptor between plasma membrane and internal compartments is governed by the balance of insertion and internalization. Denoting $k_{\\mathrm{ins}}$ as the rate of delivery to the plasma membrane and $k_{\\mathrm{int}}$ as the endocytic internalization rate, the plasma membrane fraction at steady state can be expressed symbolically as\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{PM}}=\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{ins}}}{k_{\\mathrm{ins}}+k_{\\mathrm{int}}}.\n$$\nDeletion of the sorting signal drives $k_{\\mathrm{int}}$ to a very small value relative to $k_{\\mathrm{ins}}$, implying $f_{\\mathrm{PM}} \\to 1$, so receptors accumulate at the cell surface even under sustained ligand stimulation. Alternative outcomes are inconsistent with the trafficking logic: rapid concentration in clathrin-coated vesicles (B) requires the missing signal; lysosomal accumulation (C) and Golgi retrieval (D) require internalization that does not occur efficiently; and clathrin-independent internalization at a normal rate (E) is not the predominant route for TfR and would not proceed at a normal rate in the absence of its CME sorting signal.\n\nTherefore, the mutant TfR will predominantly remain on the plasma membrane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2331475"}, {"introduction": "Once a clathrin-coated pit has assembled and invaginated, it must be physically severed from the plasma membrane to become a free-floating vesicle. This \"pinching off\" step, known as scission, is a dramatic, energy-dependent process mediated by the GTPase dynamin. This classic thought experiment [@problem_id:2331434], based on landmark studies in *Drosophila*, asks you to visualize what happens at a synapse when this molecular scissor is suddenly disabled, providing a clear picture of dynamin's essential role.", "problem": "In the field of cellular neuroscience, the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster* serves as a powerful model organism to study synaptic function. A critical process at the presynaptic terminal is clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), which recycles the vesicle membrane after neurotransmitter release. This process involves the formation of a clathrin-coated pit on the plasma membrane, which then invaginates and is eventually \"pinched off\" to form a free vesicle in the cytoplasm. The protein dynamin, a large GTPase, is essential for this final pinching-off step.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered strain of *Drosophila* that possesses a temperature-sensitive mutation in the gene encoding dynamin. In this mutant, dynamin functions correctly at a permissive temperature of 22°C but becomes rapidly non-functional at a restrictive temperature of 30°C.\n\nAn experiment is performed on the neuromuscular junction of this mutant fly. The preparation is maintained at the permissive temperature (22°C) while the presynaptic motor neuron is subjected to continuous high-frequency electrical stimulation to induce sustained neurotransmitter release. Midway through the stimulation period, the temperature of the preparation is rapidly shifted to the restrictive temperature (30°C). Immediately after the temperature shift, the synapse is chemically fixed and prepared for examination with a Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).\n\nWhich of the following descriptions best characterizes the expected ultrastructural changes at the presynaptic terminal membrane when viewed under TEM, compared to a wild-type fly subjected to the same experimental protocol?\n\nA. An accumulation of deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pits that remain connected to the presynaptic plasma membrane, often by a narrow, stalk-like neck.\n\nB. A complete absence of clathrin-coated pits, resulting in an unusually smooth presynaptic membrane despite the ongoing stimulation.\n\nC. A significant reduction in synaptic vesicle fusion events, with a large number of vesicles docked at the active zone but unable to fuse with the membrane.\n\nD. A presynaptic terminal that appears indistinguishable from a wild-type terminal, with a normal balance of endocytic and exocytic structures.\n\nE. The formation of large, unstructured aggregates of clathrin protein within the cytoplasm of the presynaptic terminal, unassociated with the plasma membrane.", "solution": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the presynaptic terminal proceeds through a defined sequence: clathrin triskelia assemble into a coat at the plasma membrane to form a clathrin-coated pit, the pit invaginates, and scission of the narrow neck that connects the coated pit to the plasma membrane is catalyzed by the large GTPase dynamin. After scission, the coated vesicle uncoats and re-enters the synaptic vesicle pool. Thus, dynamin is specifically required for the membrane fission step and acts after clathrin coat assembly and invagination have already occurred.\n\nIn the described temperature-sensitive dynamin mutant, dynamin functions at the permissive temperature $22^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ but becomes non-functional at the restrictive temperature $30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. During high-frequency stimulation at the permissive temperature, exocytosis and endocytosis proceed, maintaining vesicle recycling. Upon acute shift to $30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, dynamin activity is lost rapidly. Steps of endocytosis upstream of scission—namely clathrin coat assembly and invagination—do not require dynamin and thus continue, but the scission step is blocked. Consequently, clathrin-coated pits will form and invaginate but remain tethered to the plasma membrane via a narrow, stalk-like neck that cannot be severed.\n\nBecause the fixation occurs immediately after the temperature shift, the ultrastructural snapshot will predominantly reveal the accumulation of these arrested intermediates: deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pits that remain connected to the presynaptic membrane by narrow necks, with a concomitant reduction in free, fully formed coated vesicles. This is the classic phenotype observed in temperature-sensitive dynamin mutants such as shibire under restrictive conditions.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A matches the expected accumulation of invaginated, membrane-connected clathrin-coated pits due to failed dynamin-mediated scission.\n- Option B is incorrect because coated pits are not absent; they accumulate.\n- Option C is incorrect because dynamin loss primarily impairs endocytosis, not the fusion machinery; any reduction in fusion would be secondary and delayed due to vesicle pool depletion, not immediate inability to fuse.\n- Option D is incorrect because the restrictive shift produces a characteristic endocytic block with visible intermediates.\n- Option E is incorrect because clathrin assembles at the membrane; large unstructured cytoplasmic aggregates are not the hallmark of dynamin inactivation at this timescale.\n\nThus, the best description is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2331434"}, {"introduction": "After a clathrin-coated vesicle is successfully released into the cytoplasm, its journey is not over; the clathrin coat must be removed so the vesicle can fuse with an endosome and the coat proteins can be recycled. This uncoating process is tightly regulated, relying on specific signals to recruit the necessary machinery. By exploring the effect of inhibiting the lipid phosphatase synaptojanin [@problem_id:2331435], you will uncover how changes in the vesicle's own membrane composition are critical for triggering the final step of coat disassembly.", "problem": "In a neuroscience research laboratory, a team is investigating the molecular machinery of synaptic vesicle recycling via Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis (CME). The process begins with the recruitment of adaptor proteins and clathrin to the presynaptic terminal membrane, followed by the formation of an invaginated coated pit, scission of the vesicle from the membrane by the GTPase dynamin, and finally, uncoating of the clathrin lattice to release a \"naked\" vesicle ready for refilling with neurotransmitter.\n\nA crucial regulator of this process is the lipid Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ($PI(4,5)P_2$), which is enriched at the plasma membrane and acts as a docking site for adaptor proteins, thereby initiating coat assembly. The removal of $PI(4,5)P_2$ from the newly formed vesicle membrane is a prerequisite for the uncoating step. This lipid turnover is primarily mediated by the enzyme synaptojanin, which possesses a 5'-phosphatase domain that converts $PI(4,5)P_2$ to $PI(4)P$.\n\nThe researchers treat cultured cortical neurons with a novel experimental drug, \"Synapto-Lock,\" which is a potent and highly specific inhibitor of the 5'-phosphatase activity of synaptojanin. The drug does not affect any other enzymatic activities, including the function of dynamin or the ATPase activity of the uncoating chaperone Hsc70. The neurons are then stimulated electrically to trigger a bout of neurotransmitter release and subsequent compensatory endocytosis.\n\nBased on your understanding of the CME pathway, predict the predominant morphological phenotype of clathrin-related structures that would be observed at the presynaptic terminals of these drug-treated neurons using electron microscopy.\n\nA. An accumulation of shallow, clathrin-coated pits that fail to invaginate.\n\nB. A complete absence of clathrin-coated structures at the plasma membrane.\n\nC. An accumulation of deeply invaginated, clathrin-coated pits tethered to the presynaptic membrane by a narrow neck.\n\nD. An accumulation of free, fully-formed vesicles in the cytoplasm that remain coated with clathrin.\n\nE. An accumulation of free, uncoated synaptic vesicles in the cytoplasm, indistinguishable from a normal state.", "solution": "We proceed by mapping each mechanistic step in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) to the specific molecular requirements and then predicting the morphological consequence of selectively inhibiting synaptojanin's 5'-phosphatase.\n\n1. Coat initiation and pit formation: $PI(4,5)P_2$ at the plasma membrane provides docking sites for adaptor proteins such as AP-2 and other endocytic factors. These adaptors recruit clathrin triskelia, promoting assembly of a clathrin lattice and curvature. Because the experimental drug targets only synaptojanin's 5'-phosphatase and does not deplete $PI(4,5)P_2$ at the plasma membrane, adaptor recruitment and pit formation proceed normally.\n\n2. Invagination and scission: Continued lattice assembly produces deeply invaginated coated pits. Scission is catalyzed by dynamin, a GTPase. The problem states dynamin function is unaffected by the drug, so coated pits undergo normal scission to produce free, newly endocytosed vesicles.\n\n3. Lipid remodeling prerequisite for uncoating: After scission, uncoating requires two coordinated events:\n   - Conversion of $PI(4,5)P_2$ to $PI(4)P$ on the vesicle membrane by synaptojanin's 5'-phosphatase. This lipid switch reduces the membrane affinity of many endocytic adaptors and accessory proteins that specifically bind $PI(4,5)P_2$.\n   - ATP-dependent clathrin coat disassembly by Hsc70 (with cofactors such as auxilin), which is facilitated when adaptors and cargo release due to $PI(4,5)P_2$ depletion.\n\n4. Effect of Synapto-Lock: By selectively inhibiting synaptojanin's 5'-phosphatase, $PI(4,5)P_2$ persists on the membrane of the newly formed vesicle. This sustains high-affinity binding of AP-2 and other $PI(4,5)P_2$-dependent coat components, thereby preventing efficient recruitment or action of the uncoating machinery. Even though Hsc70 ATPase activity is intact, the persistent $PI(4,5)P_2$-adaptor interactions maintain the clathrin coat and stabilize the coated state.\n\n5. Predicted morphological phenotype by electron microscopy: Because scission is normal but uncoating is impaired, the predominant structures that accumulate are free, fully formed vesicles in the cytoplasm that remain clathrin-coated.\n\n6. Elimination of alternatives:\n   - A (shallow pits): would result from failure in early adaptor/clathrin recruitment or curvature generation, which is not impaired here.\n   - B (absence of coated structures): would require a block in coat initiation or assembly, not present here.\n   - C (deeply invaginated pits with necks): is characteristic of dynamin inhibition; dynamin is unaffected.\n   - E (free, uncoated vesicles): would require successful lipid remodeling and uncoating, which are blocked by synaptojanin inhibition.\n\nTherefore, the expected predominant phenotype is an accumulation of free, fully formed clathrin-coated vesicles in the cytoplasm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2331435"}]}
