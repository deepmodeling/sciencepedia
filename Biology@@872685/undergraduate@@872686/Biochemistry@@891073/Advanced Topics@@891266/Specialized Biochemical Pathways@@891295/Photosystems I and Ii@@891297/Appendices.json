This pathway begins with the light-induced oxidation of water at Photosystem II (PSII), which releases electrons, protons, and diatomic oxygen ($\\text{O}_2$). These electrons are then passed through a series of carriers, including the cytochrome $b_6f$ complex, to Photosystem I (PSI), and ultimately used to reduce $\\text{NADP}^+$ to NADPH.\n\nDuring this process, a proton gradient is established across the thylakoid membrane, with protons accumulating in the thylakoid lumen. This accumulation occurs through two primary mechanisms:\n1. The oxidation of water by the oxygen-evolving complex associated with PSII.\n2. The transport of protons from the stroma to the lumen by the cytochrome $b_6f$ complex, which operates via a mechanism known as the Q-cycle. For the purpose of this problem, assume that the Q-cycle translocates exactly four protons into the lumen for every two electrons that pass through the complex.\n\nConsidering the complete, non-cyclic electron transport pathway from the splitting of water to the eventual reduction of $\\text{NADP}^+$, calculate the total number of protons that accumulate in the thylakoid lumen for each molecule of diatomic oxygen ($\\text{O}_2$) produced.", "solution": "The light-driven oxidation of water at PSII produces, per molecule of diatomic oxygen formed, the reaction:\n$$2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{O}_2 + 4\\text{H}^+_{\\text{lumen}} + 4e^-$$\nThus, for each $\\text{O}_2$ produced, 4 protons are released directly into the thylakoid lumen and 4 electrons enter the electron transport chain.\n\nThese 4 electrons pass through the cytochrome $b_6f$ complex.
