A researcher is studying a newly discovered gene, designated *XEL-1*, in a laboratory model organism. The primary transcript, or pre-mRNA, transcribed directly from the *XEL-1* gene in the nucleus is found to be 8,450 nucleotides long.\n\nThis pre-mRNA undergoes post-transcriptional processing before it is exported to the cytoplasm. This processing includes splicing to remove non-coding introns, the addition of a 5' cap (a single modified guanine nucleotide), and the addition of a poly-A tail to the 3' end. The final, fully processed mature mRNA that is actively translated in the cytoplasm has a total length of 2,121 nucleotides. Further analysis reveals that the poly-A tail added to the *XEL-1* transcript is consistently 250 nucleotides long, and that all introns within this gene are of a remarkably uniform length, averaging 940 nucleotides each.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the total number of introns that were removed from the pre-mRNA transcript to form the mature mRNA.", "solution": "Let $L_{\\text{pre}}$ denote the pre-mRNA length, $L_{\\text{mature}}$ the mature mRNA length, $L_{\\text{cap}}$ the 5' cap length, $L_{\\text{polyA}}$ the poly-A tail length, $E$ the total exon length encoded in the pre-mRNA, and $L_{\\text{introns}}$ the total length of introns removed.

This practice [@problem_id:1518587] provides a hands-on simulation of a fascinating example: guide RNA-directed editing in trypanosomes. You will act as the editing machinery, using a guide RNA as a template to predict the final, edited mRNA sequence, making this abstract molecular process a concrete and logical task.", "problem": "In the kinetoplasts of protozoans like *Trypanosoma*, a unique form of post-transcriptional modification known as RNA editing occurs. This process involves the insertion or deletion of uracil (U) nucleotides in a pre-edited messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) to create a functional, mature mRNA. This editing is directed by a small guide RNA (gRNA).\n\nThe mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1. The gRNA contains an 'anchor' sequence at its 3' end that is perfectly complementary to an 'anchor site' on the 3' portion of the pre-mRNA, allowing the gRNA to bind.\n2. The region of the gRNA upstream (5') of its anchor is the 'template region'. The region of the pre-mRNA upstream (5') of its anchor site is the 'pre-editing region'.\n3. The editing process modifies the pre-editing region to create a sequence that is fully complementary to the gRNA's template region.

The gRNA is 3'-UUCGUCUCGU-UCCUAGA-5', whose anchor segment \"UCCUAGA\" is complementary to the mRNA anchor site \"AGGAUCU\" (A-U, G-C pairing for each position), confirming the correct anchor pairing.\n\nThe gRNA template region is therefore the segment \"UUCGUCUCGU\". To make the pre-editing region of the mRNA fully complementary to this template, we assign each position by Watson-Crick pairing rules (A-U and G-C, with G-U wobble allowed but not needed here).

This conceptual problem [@problem_id:2063731] delves into the Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) pathway, a critical quality control mechanism that eliminates transcripts with premature stop codons. By dissecting why a mutation's location within the final exon allows it to evade this system, you will uncover the elegant interplay between splicing, translation, and RNA degradation.", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) pathway is a crucial surveillance mechanism that detects and degrades messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts containing a Premature Termination Codon (PTC). This process prevents the synthesis of truncated, and potentially harmful, proteins. The canonical model for NMD activation involves the interplay between splicing and translation. During pre-mRNA splicing, a multi-protein complex known as the Exon Junction Complex (EJC) is deposited on the mRNA approximately 20-24 nucleotides upstream of each newly formed exon-exon junction. In a subsequent \"pioneer\" round of translation, the ribosome translocates along the mRNA, displacing the EJCs. If the ribosome encounters a PTC and terminates translation while one or more EJCs remain bound downstream, NMD is triggered, leading to the rapid degradation of the transcript.\n\nConsider a hypothetical eukaryotic gene composed of three exons and two introns. A single-nucleotide substitution results in a nonsense mutation, creating a PTC. It is observed that if this PTC is located within the third (and final) exon, the resulting mRNA transcript often escapes degradation by the NMD pathway.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate molecular explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The process of splicing does not create an exon-exon junction downstream of the final exon, hence no Exon Junction Complex is deposited downstream of a PTC located in this region.\n\nB. The poly-A tail and its associated binding proteins sterically hinder the binding of NMD factors to any PTC located within the final exon.\n\nC. The splicing machinery specifically recognizes nonsense mutations in the terminal exon during pre-mRNA processing and excises them, thus repairing the transcript before translation.\n\nD. Ribosomes translating the mRNA have a high probability of dissociating before reaching the final exon, meaning the PTC is never encountered by the translational machinery.\n\nE. The final exon lacks the specific sequence motifs required to recruit UPF1, the key helicase that initiates the NMD process, regardless of the presence of a PTC.", "solution": "First, state the canonical NMD trigger: during pre-mRNA splicing, Exon Junction Complexes (EJCs) are deposited approximately 20–24 nucleotides upstream of each exon-exon junction. During the pioneer round of translation, the ribosome removes EJCs it traverses. If translation terminates at a premature termination codon (PTC) while one or more EJCs remain bound downstream of the stop codon, the EJC-associated UPF2 and UPF3 recruit UPF1 and associated factors to activate NMD. A practical rule from this model is that a stop codon more than approximately 50–55 nucleotides upstream of the last exon-exon junction tends to trigger NMD, whereas termination in the last exon or within approximately 50 nucleotides upstream of the final junction often escapes NMD because no downstream EJC remains.\n\nApply this to the described three-exon gene. After splicing, there are two exon-exon junctions: between exons 1–2 and 2–3, with EJCs deposited upstream of each junction. If a PTC resides in exon 3 (the final exon), there is no exon-exon junction downstream of any position within exon 3, and therefore there can be no downstream EJC. The EJC associated with the 2–3 junction is positioned upstream (in exon 2) and thus lies upstream of any PTC in exon 3. Consequently, termination at a PTC in exon 3 is not followed by a downstream EJC, so the EJC-dependent recruitment of UPF factors that initiates NMD is not triggered. This explains why such transcripts frequently evade NMD.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A correctly captures the canonical EJC-dependent mechanism: there is no exon-exon junction downstream of the final exon, thus no downstream EJC to trigger NMD when termination occurs in the last exon.\n- B overgeneralizes the role of poly-A binding protein; although proximity of poly-A binding protein can antagonize NMD, it is not the principal reason in the canonical EJC model, nor does it universally block NMD for any PTC in the last exon.\n- C is false; splicing does not recognize or repair nonsense mutations.\n- D is false; ribosomes generally translate through to the 3' end unless impeded.\n- E is false; UPF1 recruitment depends on EJC-associated factors and termination context, not on a lack of motifs unique to the final exon.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate molecular explanation is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2063731"}]}
