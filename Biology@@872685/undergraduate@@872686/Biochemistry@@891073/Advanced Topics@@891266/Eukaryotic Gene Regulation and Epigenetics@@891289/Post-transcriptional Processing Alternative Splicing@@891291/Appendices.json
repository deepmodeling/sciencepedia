Consider a hypothetical gene, *Temporin*, whose pre-mRNA transcript has a linear structure consisting of four exons (E1, E2, E3, E4) and three introns (I1, I2, I3). The segments are arranged from the 5' end to the 3' end in the following order:\n\n5' - E1 - I1 - E2 - I2 - E3 - I3 - E4 - 3'\n\nIn most tissues, this pre-mRNA is processed through canonical splicing. However, in neuronal tissue, the processing involves a specific alternative splicing event where Exon 3 (E3) is selectively excluded from the final mature mRNA molecule. The relative order of the remaining exons is preserved.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly represents the structure of the mature *Temporin* mRNA produced in neuronal tissue?\n\nA. 5' - E1 - E4 - E2 - 3'\n\nB. 5' - E1 - I1 - E2 - I2 - E4 - 3'\n\nC. 5' - E1 - E2 - E3 - E4 - 3'\n\nD. 5' - E1 - E2 - E4 - 3'\n\nE. 5' - I1 - I2 - I3 - 3'", "solution": "We start from the given pre-mRNA organization: 5' - E1 - I1 - E2 - I2 - E3 - I3 - E4 - 3'. In canonical splicing, introns are removed and exons are ligated in their genomic order, yielding a mature mRNA with exons E1, E2, E3, E4 in order.\n\nIn neuronal tissue, a specific alternative splicing event occurs: exon skipping of E3. Exon skipping means the designated exon (E3) is excluded from the mature mRNA, while the remaining exons are spliced together, preserving their relative order. Introns are still removed during splicing.\n\nTherefore, the mature neuronal mRNA must contain E1, E2, and E4 in order, with all introns removed. This corresponds to 5' - E1 - E2 - E4 - 3'.\n\nChecking the options:\n- A places E4 before E2, which violates the preserved order requirement.\n- B retains introns, which is incorrect for mature mRNA.\n- C includes E3, which contradicts the specified exon skipping.\n- D is 5' - E1 - E2 - E4 - 3', which matches exon 3 skipping with preserved order and intron removal.\n- E consists only of introns, which cannot form mature mRNA.\n\nThus, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2063406"}, {"introduction": "Accurate splicing depends on the recognition of specific sequences at exon-intron boundaries by the spliceosome. This next practice explores the critical consequences of mutations within these conserved splice sites, a common cause of genetic diseases. By analyzing the effect of a point mutation at a 5' splice site, you will see how a seemingly small genetic change can lead to the retention of an entire intron in the mature mRNA [@problem_id:2063443].", "problem": "A hypothetical human gene, *ENZ-X*, codes for a critical metabolic enzyme. The pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) transcript of this gene consists of three exons (Exon 1, Exon 2, Exon 3) and two introns (Intron 1, Intron 2) in the following arrangement: Exon 1 - Intron 1 - Exon 2 - Intron 2 - Exon 3. Normal processing of this transcript involves the removal of both Intron 1 and Intron 2 to produce a mature messenger RNA (mRNA) that is translated into the functional enzyme.\n\nA severe genetic disorder is traced to a single-nucleotide G-to-A mutation on the DNA coding strand. This mutation is located at the very first nucleotide position of Intron 1.\n\nWhich of the following statements describes the most probable structure of the mature mRNA molecule produced from this mutated *ENZ-X* gene?\n\nA. The mRNA will consist of Exon 1, Exon 2, and Exon 3, identical to the wild-type mRNA.\n\nB. The mRNA will consist of Exon 1 and Exon 3, with Exon 2 having been skipped.\n\nC. The mRNA will consist of Exon 1, the entirety of Intron 1, Exon 2, and Exon 3.\n\nD. Transcription of the gene will be halted, resulting in no mRNA product.\n\nE. The mRNA will consist only of Exon 1, as splicing cannot proceed past the mutation.", "solution": "The normal arrangement is Exon 1 - Intron 1 - Exon 2 - Intron 2 - Exon 3. In eukaryotic pre-mRNA splicing by the major spliceosome, the canonical 5' splice donor site at the exon-intron junction is defined by an invariant dinucleotide: on the DNA coding strand it is typically GT at the first two nucleotides of the intron, which corresponds to GU in the pre-mRNA. The 3' splice acceptor site at the intron-exon junction typically ends in AG on the DNA coding strand, corresponding to AG in the pre-mRNA. Recognition of the 5' splice site requires the GU at the start of the intron and binding by U1 snRNP; this GU-AG rule is essential for correct intron removal via the two transesterification reactions.\n\nThe mutation described is a single-nucleotide G-to-A change on the DNA coding strand at the very first nucleotide of Intron 1. In the wild type, the first two nucleotides of Intron 1 on the coding strand are GT, which yields a GU in the pre-mRNA at the 5' splice donor site. After the mutation, the first nucleotide on the coding strand becomes A, changing GT to AT on DNA and thus GU to AU on the pre-mRNA at the 5' splice donor of Intron 1.\n\nDisruption of the invariant G at the 5' splice donor site abolishes the canonical GU required for U1 snRNP recognition and thus prevents normal splicing at the 5' end of Intron 1. Without a functional 5' donor, the spliceosome cannot excise Intron 1 by the normal pathway. The most probable outcome in the absence of an alternative nearby cryptic donor site is retention of the entirety of Intron 1 in the mature mRNA. This mutation does not halt transcription because transcription proceeds independently of splicing signals, and it does not preclude splicing of other introns whose splice sites remain intact; therefore, Intron 2 can still be removed normally, producing an mRNA that contains Exon 1, retained Intron 1, Exon 2, and Exon 3.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is unlikely because the 5' splice donor site of Intron 1 is disrupted, so normal removal of Intron 1 will not occur.\n- B (skipping Exon 2) is not the expected consequence of destroying the 5' donor of Intron 1; the primary effect is failure to remove Intron 1, not skipping of Exon 2.\n- C matches the expected intron retention outcome: Exon 1, the entirety of Intron 1, Exon 2, and Exon 3.\n- D is incorrect because transcription is not halted by an intronic splice-site mutation.\n- E is incorrect because splicing can proceed for other introns (Intron 2), and the pre-mRNA will not consist only of Exon 1.\n\nTherefore, the most probable structure is described by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2063443"}, {"introduction": "The final step in understanding the impact of a splicing error is to determine its effect on the protein product. Building on the concept of intron retention, this problem demonstrates how the inclusion of intronic sequences can drastically alter the translational reading frame. You will apply the genetic code to a faulty mRNA to predict how a retained intron can introduce a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated and non-functional protein [@problem_id:2063407].", "problem": "A researcher is studying a hypothetical human gene, *PROT1*, which is essential for cellular metabolism. The gene consists of two coding exons (Exon 1 and Exon 2) separated by a single intron. Under normal conditions, the intron is precisely removed during post-transcriptional processing, and the resulting mature messenger RNA (mRNA) is translated into the functional PROT1 protein.\n\nThe researcher discovers a cell line with a point mutation in a splice site recognition sequence. This mutation leads to a splicing error where the entire intron between Exon 1 and Exon 2 is retained in the mature mRNA transcript.\n\nYou are provided with the relevant nucleotide sequences and a partial genetic code table:\n\n- The coding sequence at the 3' end of Exon 1 is: `... 5'-UCU GGC AAG-3' ...`\n- The complete sequence of the retained intron is: `5'-GUA GUC UAG GU-3'`\n- The coding sequence at the 5' end of Exon 2 is: `... 5'-UUC CUG GAG-3' ...`\n\nPartial Genetic Code Table (Codon: Amino Acid):\n- `AAG`: Lysine (Lys)\n- `CUG`: Leucine (Leu)\n- `GAG`: Glutamic Acid (Glu)\n- `GGC`: Glycine (Gly)\n- `GUA`: Valine (Val)\n- `GUC`: Valine (Val)\n- `UCU`: Serine (Ser)\n- `UUC`: Phenylalanine (Phe)\n- `UAG`: STOP\n\nAs a result of this intron retention, a non-functional, truncated protein is produced.

The protein terminates immediately after the Lysine coded by Exon 1.", "solution": "The key principles are:\n- Translation reads the mature mRNA from the 5' end to the 3' end in non-overlapping triplets (codons) starting from an established reading frame, adding one amino acid per codon.\n- The reading frame continues uninterrupted across exon-exon junctions if the upstream exon ends at a codon boundary; insertion of additional nucleotides preserves the frame at the insertion point but changes the codons that are read.\n- Translation terminates when a stop codon (such as UAG) is encountered.\n\nIdentify the normal end of Exon 1 and its reading frame:\n- The provided 3' end of Exon 1 is 5'-UCU GGC AAG-3'. These are complete codons: UCU (Ser), GGC (Gly), AAG (Lys). Thus, the last normal amino acid from Exon 1 is Lys encoded by AAG, and the codon boundary aligns exactly at the exon end.\n\nWith intron retention, the mRNA after Exon 1 continues directly into the intron:\n- The retained intron sequence is 5'-GUA GUC UAG GU-3'. Translation continues in the same reading frame established by Exon 1, so the next codon after AAG is the first triplet of the intron.\n\nTranslate the intronic codons in-frame until a stop codon appears:\n- First intron codon: GUA translates to Valine (Val).\n- Second intron codon: GUC translates to Valine (Val).\n- Third intron codon: UAG is a stop codon, which terminates translation immediately upon its recognition.\n\nTherefore, the amino acids appended to the C-terminus of the otherwise normal portion (ending with Lys from Exon 1) are Val-Val, after which translation stops at UAG. Any remaining intronic nucleotides (the trailing GU) and the following Exon 2 codons are not translated because termination has already occurred.\n\nThis corresponds to option A (Val-Val).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2063407"}]}
