They isolate a short, double-stranded DNA fragment from a promoter region and want to determine its methylation pattern. The sequence of the original DNA fragment is:\n\n5'-AGC¹GTTC²AG-3'\n3'-TCGCAAGTC³-5'\n\nNote that the cytosines of interest have been labeled with superscripts 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThe researcher performs a bisulfite sequencing analysis. The entire double-stranded DNA fragment is treated with sodium bisulfite, a chemical that converts unmethylated cytosine (C) bases into uracil (U). Methylated cytosines (specifically, 5-methylcytosine) are resistant to this conversion and remain as cytosines. Following the chemical treatment, the two strands are separated and their sequences are determined. Standard sequencing technology reads any uracil (U) base as a thymine (T).\n\nThe sequence read from the original top strand is:\n5'-AGCGTTTAG-3'\n\nThe sequence read from the original bottom strand (presented here in the 3' to 5' orientation to align with the original fragment) is:\n3'-TCGCAAGTT-5'\n\nBased on these results, what are the methylation states of the three labeled cytosines (C¹, C², and C³) in the original double-stranded DNA molecule?\n\nA.

The conversion is strand-specific and is assessed by directly comparing the post-bisulfite read of each original strand to its pre-treatment sequence.\n\nTop strand analysis:\n- Original top strand: 5'-A G C^{1} G T T C^{2} A G-3'.\n- Post-bisulfite read (top strand): 5'-A G C G T T T A G-3'.\n- At position of C^{1} (third base), the read shows C, so C^{1} did not convert and is methylated.\n- At position of C^{2} (seventh base), the read shows T, so C^{2} converted and is unmethylated.\n\nBottom strand analysis:\n- Original bottom strand (presented 3' to 5' to align): 3'-T C G C A A G T C^{3}-5'.\n- Post-bisulfite read (bottom strand, 3' to 5'): 3'-T C G C A A G T T-5'.\n- At the position of C^{3} (last base), the read shows T, so C^{3} converted and is unmethylated.\n\nTherefore, C^{1} is methylated, C^{2} is unmethylated, and C^{3} is unmethylated, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2040287"}, {"introduction": "Once established, how are DNA methylation patterns passed down through cell division? The process of maintenance methylation ensures that epigenetic information is faithfully inherited, but what would happen if this machinery failed?

DNMT inhibition prevents methylation of any newly synthesized strand; thus methylation marks persist only on pre-existing strands and are never added to new strands.\n\nStart: At generation 0 there is one fully methylated duplex with two methylated strands.\n\nAfter 1 round: Each original strand templates a new unmethylated strand, yielding two daughter molecules, each hemimethylated (one methylated strand paired with one unmethylated strand).

In the specific cancer cell line being studied, the promoter of *TSG1* is hypermethylated, leading to transcriptional repression and loss of the gene's function. The relationship between the transcription rate of *TSG1*, denoted by $T$, and the fraction of methylated Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites in its promoter, denoted by $M$, is empirically described by the model:\n\n$$T(M) = T_{max} \\exp(-\\alpha M)$$\n\nwhere $T_{max}$ is the theoretical maximum transcription rate (at zero methylation), $M$ is the methylation fraction (ranging from 0 for fully unmethylated to 1 for fully methylated), and $\\alpha$ is a \"silencing coefficient\" that quantifies the repressive strength of methylation for this specific gene promoter.\n\nTo reactivate *TSG1*, the researchers employ an advanced Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) based tool.
