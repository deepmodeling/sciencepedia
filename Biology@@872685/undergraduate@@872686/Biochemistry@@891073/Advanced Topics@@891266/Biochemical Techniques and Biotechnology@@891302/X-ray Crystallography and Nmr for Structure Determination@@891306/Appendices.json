Typical interpretability thresholds are:\n- Around 1.0–1.2 Angstrom: individual atoms, including many hydrogen atoms, can be visualized; precise bond lengths and angles can be refined anisotropically.\n- Around 1.5–2.5 Angstrom: most side chains are well resolved; ordered water molecules are visible; hydrogen atoms are generally not seen by X-ray.\n- Around 3.0–3.5 Angstrom: main-chain trace is reliable; some large or constrained side chains can be placed, but many rotamers remain ambiguous; waters are generally not reliable.\n- Around 4.0 Angstrom and worse: electron density supports the overall fold, secondary structure elements (alpha helices as rods and beta sheets as sheets), and a backbone trace, but side-chain conformations are poorly defined and solvent/precise geometry are not reliably determined.\n\nEvaluate each option at 4.0 Angstrom:\n- A: Precise positions of all atoms including hydrogen atoms require near-atomic resolution around 1.0 Angstrom; false.\n- B: Conformations of most side chains and ordered waters require about 2.0–2.5 Angstrom or better; false.\n- C: Overall fold and backbone path are accessible at about 3.5–4.0 Angstrom; true.\n- D: Exact bond lengths and angles require very high resolution near 1.2 Angstrom; false.\n- E: Identity of a metal ion could sometimes be inferred using anomalous scattering or coordination chemistry, but at 4.0 Angstrom the density alone is insufficient for reliable identification; not the best description based solely on resolution.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is the overall fold and backbone trace.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2087789"}, {"introduction": "Before a protein structure can be solved by NMR, every signal in the spectrum must be assigned to a specific atom in the protein sequence.

In this spectrum, each non-proline amino acid residue should give rise to a single cross-peak corresponding to its backbone amide group. However, in a crowded central region of the spectrum, two distinct amide signals, designated Peak 1 and Peak 2, are found to be severely overlapped, preventing their unambiguous assignment.\n\nThe 2D coordinates ($^{1}\\text{H}_\\text{N}$ chemical shift, $^{15}\\text{N}_\\text{H}$ chemical shift) for these peaks are:\n- Peak 1: (8.31 ppm, 118.5 ppm)\n- Peak 2: (8.32 ppm, 118.6 ppm)\n\nTo resolve this ambiguity, a three-dimensional CBCA(CO)NH experiment is performed.

If the interaction is thermodynamically unfavorable, the interface will not be populated in solution and is likely a crystal packing artifact.\n\nThe relevant thermodynamic condition is that the standard free energy of binding must be negative for spontaneous association in solution.

Computational interface assessment tools often report an interface solvation free energy gain, commonly denoted $\\Delta G^{\\text{int}}$, where a negative value indicates a favorable stabilization upon interface formation and a positive value indicates unfavorable energetics.\n\nEvaluate each option against this criterion and other well-established heuristics for biological versus crystal contacts:\n- Option A: Two-fold rotational symmetry is common in physiological homodimers. Symmetry alone does not diagnose a crystal contact; thus it is not strong evidence for an artifact.\n- Option B: A buried solvent-accessible surface area near $1850 \\text{ \\AA}^{2}$ lies within the range often seen for physiological interfaces (typically exceeding $10^{3} \\text{ \\AA}^{2}$). Crystal contacts are frequently smaller. This is not strong evidence for a non-physiological contact.\n- Option C: The presence of multiple hydrogen bonds and salt bridges generally supports interface specificity and stability; it does not provide strong evidence for an artifact.\n- Option D: High conservation of interface residues across orthologs implies evolutionary selection for that interface, supporting biological relevance rather than a crystal artifact.\n- Option E: A calculated interface solvation free energy gain $\\Delta G^{\\text{int}}=+3.1 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}$ is positive, i.e., unfavorable.
