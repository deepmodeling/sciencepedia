The transcription of the messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule that codes for this enzyme is driven by a synthetic, constitutive promoter, which ensures a constant production rate of new mRNA molecules. This production rate is denoted by $\\alpha$ and has units of molecules per cell per second.\n\nSimultaneously, the cell's natural degradation machinery, including ribonucleases, breaks down these mRNA molecules. This degradation process can be effectively modeled as a first-order kinetic process with a rate constant $k_d$, which has units of inverse seconds (s$^{-1}$).\n\nLet $N(t)$ represent the number of molecules of this specific mRNA within a single cell at time $t$. The system begins at time $t=0$ with no molecules of this mRNA present, i.e., $N(0) = 0$. After a sufficient amount of time, the number of mRNA molecules per cell approaches a constant value, known as the steady-state level.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for this steady-state number of mRNA molecules, $N_{ss}$, in terms of the production rate $\\alpha$ and the degradation rate constant $k_d$.", "solution": "The number of mRNA molecules per cell, $N(t)$, changes due to constant production and first-order degradation.

This practice explores one of the most critical of these features: the length of the 3' poly(A) tail [@problem_id:2057499]. By comparing two otherwise identical mRNAs in a hypothetical scenario, you will apply your knowledge of decay mechanisms to predict which molecule has a longer functional lifespan and yields more protein.", "problem": "A team of bioengineers is designing a synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutic intended to produce a missing enzyme, Protein-X, within a patient's cells. To optimize the yield of Protein-X, they create two distinct batches of mRNA molecules. Both versions possess the identical 5' cap and the complete coding sequence for Protein-X. The only difference lies in the length of their 3' polyadenylate (poly(A)) tails.\n\n- **mRNA-Alpha**: This molecule is synthesized with a long poly(A) tail, approximately 200 adenosine nucleotides in length.\n- **mRNA-Beta**: This molecule is synthesized with a very short poly(A) tail, only about 25 adenosine nucleotides long.\n\nEqual molar quantities of mRNA-Alpha and mRNA-Beta are introduced into separate, identical populations of cultured human cells. Assuming the translation machinery of the cells is not a limiting factor, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of this experiment regarding the production of Protein-X?\n\nA. mRNA-Beta will produce more Protein-X because a shorter tail allows for faster termination of translation, enabling ribosomes to be recycled more quickly.\n\nB. Both mRNAs will produce an equal amount of Protein-X because the poly(A) tail's primary role is in nuclear export, a step that is bypassed in this experiment.\n\nC. mRNA-Alpha will produce more Protein-X because the long poly(A) tail serves as a binding site for ribosomes, directly increasing the rate of translation initiation.\n\nD. mRNA-Beta will produce more Protein-X because a long poly(A) tail is known to trigger a cellular stress response that leads to the shutdown of global protein synthesis.\n\nE. mRNA-Alpha will produce more Protein-X because the long poly(A) tail protects the mRNA from premature degradation, increasing its functional lifespan within the cell.", "solution": "The poly(A) tail on eukaryotic mRNAs has two major cytoplasmic roles relevant here: (i) it recruits poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), which interacts with eIF4G and eIF4E at the 5' cap to form a closed-loop messenger ribonucleoprotein that enhances translation initiation efficiency, and (ii) it protects the mRNA from degradation by 3' to 5' exonucleases and delays the deadenylation-dependent decapping that precedes rapid decay. A longer poly(A) tail therefore generally increases translational efficiency and, crucially, increases mRNA stability and functional lifespan in the cytoplasm.\n\nLet the initial number of mRNA molecules be equal and given by $N_{0}$ for both mRNA-Alpha and mRNA-Beta. Model cytoplasmic mRNA decay as first-order with rate constants $k_{\\alpha}$ and $k_{\\beta}$, respectively, with $k_{\\alpha}<k_{\\beta}$ because the longer tail of mRNA-Alpha confers greater stability. Then the abundances evolve as $N_{\\alpha}(t)=N_{0}\\exp(-k_{\\alpha} t)$ and $N_{\\beta}(t)=N_{0}\\exp(-k_{\\beta} t)$. Let the per-mRNA translation initiation rates be $r_{\\alpha}$ and $r_{\\beta}$; due to stronger PABP recruitment and closed-loop formation, one expects $r_{\\alpha}\\ge r_{\\beta}$, but even if $r_{\\alpha}=r_{\\beta}$, stability alone determines a higher cumulative output for mRNA-Alpha. The total amount of Protein-X synthesized over the mRNA lifetime is proportional to the time integral of translation, giving $P_{\\alpha}=\\int_{0}^{\\infty} r_{\\alpha}N_{\\alpha}(t)\\,dt=\\frac{r_{\\alpha}N_{0}}{k_{\\alpha}}$ and $P_{\\beta}=\\frac{r_{\\beta}N_{0}}{k_{\\beta}}$. With $k_{\\alpha}<k_{\\beta}$ and $r_{\\alpha}\\ge r_{\\beta}$, it follows that $P_{\\alpha}>P_{\\beta}$.\n\nEvaluating the options: A is incorrect because poly(A) length does not control translation termination or ribosome recycling; termination kinetics are not the limiting factor here. B is incorrect because the poly(A) tail has critical cytoplasmic roles in stability and translation that are not bypassed by transfection. C is incorrect as the poly(A) tail is not a direct ribosome binding site; its effect is mediated by PABP and initiation factors. D is incorrect because long poly(A) tails do not trigger a stress response that shuts down translation. E accurately states that a long poly(A) tail protects mRNA from premature degradation, extending its functional lifespan and thereby increasing total protein production when translation machinery is not limiting. Therefore, mRNA-Alpha will produce more Protein-X.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2057499"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the general turnover of healthy transcripts, cells possess elegant quality control systems to identify and eliminate defective mRNAs before they can produce potentially harmful proteins. This problem delves into the fascinating world of mRNA surveillance by presenting a case of a splicing error that introduces a premature termination codon (PTC) [@problem_id:2057477]. Your task is to deduce the fate of this faulty transcript, thereby uncovering the logic of the crucial Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) pathway.", "problem": "In a eukaryotic cell, a particular gene, designated *GEN-1*, consists of three exons and two introns. Normally, after transcription, the two introns are precisely removed by the spliceosome, and the three exons are ligated together to form a mature messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript. At each newly formed exon-exon junction, a multi-protein complex known as the Exon Junction Complex (EJC) is deposited. This mature mRNA is then exported to the cytoplasm for translation.\n\nA researcher discovers a point mutation in the DNA sequence at the 3' splice site of the first intron. This mutation significantly weakens the splice site, causing a fraction of the *GEN-1* transcripts to fail splicing at this location. Consequently, these faulty transcripts are exported to the cytoplasm with the first intron still present between exon 1 and exon 2. Analysis of the retained intron's sequence reveals that it contains an in-frame stop codon, creating what is known as a Premature Termination Codon (PTC), located upstream of the EJC that marks the junction between exon 2 and exon 3.\n\nAssuming the cell's quality control machinery is fully functional, what is the most likely fate of these faulty mRNA transcripts containing the retained intron?\n\nA. The mRNA will be rapidly degraded by the Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) pathway.\n\nB. The mRNA will be translated until the PTC is reached, producing a stable, truncated protein.\n\nC. The mRNA will be degraded through the normal, basal turnover pathway at a rate comparable to correctly spliced transcripts.\n\nD. The ribosome will stall upon reaching the complex secondary structure of the retained intron, triggering the No-Go Decay (NGD) pathway.\n\nE. The retained intron will be recognized and spliced out in the cytoplasm before translation begins.", "solution": "We identify the normal processing of a three-exon eukaryotic gene: after nuclear splicing, introns are removed, exon-exon junctions are ligated, and an Exon Junction Complex (EJC) is deposited approximately one exon-exon junction upstream of each splice junction. The mature mRNA is exported and undergoes a pioneer round of translation in the cytoplasm. During this pioneer round, ribosomes remove EJCs they traverse.\n\nIn the described mutant, the 3' splice site of intron 1 is weakened, leading to intron 1 retention in a subset of transcripts. Because splicing between exon 1 and exon 2 fails, no EJC is deposited at that junction. However, the junction between exon 2 and exon 3 remains properly spliced, so an EJC is present there. The retained intron contains an in-frame premature termination codon (PTC) located upstream of the EJC at the exon 2–exon 3 junction.\n\nMechanistic rule for Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD): if translation terminates at a stop codon while there remains at least one downstream EJC (typically when a stop codon is more than approximately 50–55 nucleotides upstream of a downstream exon-exon junction), the termination event is recognized as premature. The terminating ribosome at the PTC interacts with release factors and UPF1, which, through UPF2/UPF3 bound to the downstream EJC, assembles the NMD machinery. This triggers mRNA degradation via deadenylation, decapping, and exonucleolytic decay, reducing the abundance of the faulty transcript.\n\nApplying this to the scenario: translation initiates at the 5' end, proceeds through exon 1 into the retained intron, and encounters the PTC before reaching the exon 2–exon 3 EJC. Because the EJC at exon 2–exon 3 is downstream of the PTC, it remains bound at the time of premature termination, fulfilling the key NMD trigger condition. Therefore, the faulty mRNA is targeted for rapid degradation by NMD.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is consistent with the presence of a PTC upstream of a downstream EJC, the canonical trigger for NMD.\n- B is unlikely because NMD reduces steady-state levels of the mRNA; while a truncated polypeptide may be transiently initiated, the most likely fate is rapid mRNA decay, not stability.\n- C is incorrect because the presence of a PTC with a downstream EJC accelerates decay beyond basal turnover.\n- D is incorrect because No-Go Decay is typically triggered by ribosome stalling on secondary structures or difficult sequences, not by premature termination.\n- E is incorrect because canonical spliceosome-mediated splicing occurs in the nucleus; cytoplasmic splicing of such retained introns is not the norm.\n\nTherefore, the most likely fate of these faulty transcripts is degradation by NMD.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2057477"}]}
