Their analysis of the protein's primary amino acid sequence reveals two key features:\n\n1.  An N-terminal, 20-amino-acid-long signal sequence that is recognized by the cellular machinery responsible for targeting proteins to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). This sequence is known to be cleaved off by a signal peptidase in the ER lumen.\n2.  A single, highly hydrophobic domain of 25 amino acids located centrally within the polypeptide chain. This domain functions as a stop-transfer anchor sequence.\n\nAssuming the protein is synthesized on a ribosome that becomes associated with the ER membrane, predict the final topology of the mature Tectorin-A protein with respect to the ER membrane and its surrounding compartments.\n\nA.

The protein will span the membrane twice, with both its N-terminus and C-terminus located in the cytosol.", "solution": "Given an N-terminal signal sequence that targets the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the ER, the following sequence of events occurs:\n\n1) The N-terminal signal sequence is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP) in the cytosol, which pauses translation and delivers the ribosome to the SRP receptor on the ER membrane. The ribosome engages the Sec61 translocon, and translation resumes with the growing polypeptide entering the translocon channel.\n\n2) Because the signal sequence is N-terminal and cleavable, it initiates translocation of the nascent chain into the ER lumen. A signal peptidase in the ER lumen cleaves the N-terminal signal sequence, leaving the new N-terminus of the protein in the ER lumen. At this stage, the polypeptide N-terminus is luminal.\n\n3) As translation continues, the central, highly hydrophobic 25-amino-acid domain reaches the translocon. This sequence acts as a stop-transfer anchor. By definition, a stop-transfer sequence halts further translocation of the polypeptide through the channel and causes lateral partitioning of the hydrophobic segment into the lipid bilayer, forming a single transmembrane helix.\n\n4) Once the stop-transfer anchor inserts into the membrane, portions of the polypeptide synthesized after this segment are not translocated into the lumen; instead, they remain on the cytosolic side. Thus, the C-terminal region resides in the cytosol.\n\n5) Topology prediction: The protein becomes a single-pass (single-spanning) transmembrane protein with its N-terminus in the ER lumen (due to initial translocation and signal peptide cleavage) and its C-terminus in the cytosol (due to the stop-transfer anchor halting translocation and anchoring the protein). This corresponds to a type I membrane protein topology.\n\n6) Exclusion of alternatives:\n- Option B would require a signal-anchor that orients the N-terminus to the cytosol, which is inconsistent with a cleaved N-terminal signal sequence.\n- Option C would require no stop-transfer/membrane anchor, contradicting the presence of the hydrophobic stop-transfer sequence.\n- Option D is incompatible with the presence of an N-terminal ER signal sequence.\n- Option E would require two transmembrane segments, but only one stop-transfer anchor is described.\n\nTherefore, the correct topology is a single-pass transmembrane protein with N-terminus in the ER lumen and C-terminus in the cytosol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2067160"}, {"introduction": "Nature has evolved a sophisticated toolkit of signals to create complex protein architectures, such as the seven-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors. This problem challenges you to act as a protein engineer, using a defined set of topogenic signals to construct a specific multi-pass topology ([@problem_id:2067151]). Solving this puzzle requires you to master the logic of how different types of signal-anchor and stop-transfer sequences work in concert to weave a polypeptide back and forth across the ER membrane.", "problem": "A hypothetical multi-pass transmembrane protein is destined for the plasma membrane of a eukaryotic cell. Its synthesis involves co-translational translocation into the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). The final topology of this protein in the ER membrane requires it to have exactly seven transmembrane domains, with its N-terminus located in the ER lumen and its C-terminus located in the cytosol.\n\nThe insertion and orientation of this protein are governed by a specific sequence of topogenic signals within its polypeptide chain. For the purpose of this problem, consider the following three types of signals:\n\n-   **Type I Signal-Anchor (SA-I):** An internal, un-cleaved sequence that initiates translocation and serves as the first transmembrane domain. It orients the polypeptide such that its N-terminus is in the ER lumen and its C-terminus is in the cytosol.\n-   **Type II Signal-Anchor (SA-II):** An internal, un-cleaved sequence that initiates translocation and serves as a transmembrane domain. It orients the polypeptide such that its N-terminus is in the cytosol and its C-terminus is in the ER lumen.\n-   **Stop-Transfer Anchor (STA):** An internal sequence that halts the translocation of a polypeptide chain through the translocon.
