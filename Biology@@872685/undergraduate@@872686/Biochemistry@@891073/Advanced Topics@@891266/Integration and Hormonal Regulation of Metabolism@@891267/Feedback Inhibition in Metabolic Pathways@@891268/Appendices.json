The synthesis involves two intermediate compounds, B and C, following the sequence A → B → C → D. Each step is facilitated by a specific enzyme. The enzyme responsible for the first step of the pathway, converting A to B, is an allosteric enzyme. Its activity is inhibited when the final product, D, binds to a regulatory site on the enzyme. This mechanism allows the cell to regulate the production of D.\n\nImagine the microorganism is subjected to an environmental stress that requires it to rapidly utilize Product D for a separate defensive process. As a result, the intracellular pool of free Product D is quickly and significantly depleted. Assuming that the initial Substrate A is continuously supplied and is not a limiting factor, what will be the most immediate consequence for the intracellular concentrations of the pathway intermediates, B and C?\n\nA.

Assume $A$ is continuously supplied and not limiting, so changes in $v_{1}$ are dominated by the change in $[D]$.\n\nBefore stress, in steady state, fluxes are equal:\n$$\nv_{1}^{0}=v_{2}^{0}=v_{3}^{0}=J_{0},\\quad [B]=[B]_{0},\\quad [C]=[C]_{0},\\quad [D]=[D]_{0}.\n$$\nEnvironmental stress rapidly depletes free $D$, so $[D]$ decreases to $[D]^{+}< [D]_{0}$.

Consequently, both $[B]$ and $[C]$ rise from their initial levels.\n\nAt the new steady state under continued low $[D]$, inhibition of $E_{1}$ remains relieved, so the pathway flux increases to some $J_{1}>J_{0}$ with $v_{1}=v_{2}=v_{3}=J_{1}$. For typical monotonic kinetics, achieving $v_{2}=J_{1}$ and $v_{3}=J_{1}$ with unchanged enzymes requires higher $[B]$ and $[C]$ than at $J_{0}$.
