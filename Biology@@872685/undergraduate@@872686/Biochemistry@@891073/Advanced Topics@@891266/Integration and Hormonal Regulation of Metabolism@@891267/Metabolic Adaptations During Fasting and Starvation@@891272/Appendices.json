This practice problem models this phase, requiring you to calculate the amount of muscle protein that must be catabolized to meet the brain's daily glucose needs. This calculation [@problem_id:2057785] highlights the unsustainable cost of relying solely on gluconeogenesis from protein and underscores the physiological imperative for metabolic adaptation.", "problem": "During the initial phase of starvation, after the depletion of liver glycogen stores, the body must synthesize glucose to meet the needs of obligate glucose-dependent tissues, primarily the brain. This process, known as gluconeogenesis, relies heavily on precursors derived from the catabolism of mobilizable muscle protein.\n\nConsider a scenario where an individual has entered this state of starvation. The brain requires a constant supply of 120 g of glucose per day. To solve this problem, you will use a simplified biochemical model with the following parameters and assumptions:\n\n1.  The molar mass of glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$) is 180.16 g/mol.\n2.  Muscle protein is considered the sole source for gluconeogenic precursors.\n3.  Muscle protein is modeled as a uniform polymer of 'average' amino acid residues, where the average molar mass of a single amino acid residue as it exists within the protein chain is 110 g/mol.\n4.  Upon catabolism, each 'average' amino acid residue can provide a net yield of 3 carbon atoms that are successfully converted into glucose in the liver.\n\nUsing this model, calculate the minimum mass of muscle protein that must be catabolized to supply the brain with its complete glucose requirement for one day.

This thought experiment [@problem_id:2057750] quantifies the importance of this adaptation by exploring a hypothetical scenario where the brain's access to ketones is blocked. By calculating the glucose required to compensate, you will appreciate the massive gluconeogenic burden the body avoids by embracing ketosis.", "problem": "During prolonged starvation (e.g., several weeks), the human body undergoes significant metabolic adaptations to preserve protein and supply fuel to the brain. The brain, which normally relies almost exclusively on glucose, adapts to use ketone bodies as its primary energy source. This transport of ketone bodies across the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) is mediated by Monocarboxylate Transporters (MCTs).\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario involving an adult in a state of prolonged starvation. In this state, ketone bodies supply 75.0% of the brain's total daily energy needs, with the remainder supplied by glucose. The brain has a constant total energy requirement of 2500 kJ per day. A new experimental drug is administered that acts as a highly specific and 100% effective inhibitor of the MCTs at the BBB, completely blocking the transport of ketone bodies into the brain, but having no other metabolic effects. To prevent immediate and severe neuroglycopenia, the body must compensate by increasing hepatic gluconeogenesis to supply the brain with sufficient glucose to meet its entire energy demand.\n\nAssume the following energy yields for complete aerobic oxidation:\n- 1 gram of glucose yields 15.6 kJ of energy.\n- 1 gram of beta-hydroxybutyrate (the principal ketone body) yields 19.4 kJ of energy.\n\nCalculate the minimum additional mass of glucose that the liver must synthesize per day specifically to compensate for the energy deficit in the brain caused by the MCT inhibitor.
