[@problem_id:2079793]", "problem": "A research group is investigating a novel antiproliferative compound, designated CP-401, for its potential as a cancer therapy. When human leukemia cells in culture are treated with CP-401, metabolic analysis reveals a rapid and significant increase in the intracellular concentration of Dihydrofolate (DHF). Concurrently, the rate of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) synthesis is severely inhibited, primarily due to a shortage of thymidine triphosphate (dTTP). To sustain DNA synthesis, cells must continuously regenerate Tetrahydrofolate (THF) from DHF, a product of the thymidylate synthesis reaction.\n\nBased on the observed accumulation of DHF, which of the following enzymes is the most likely primary target of the inhibitor CP-401?\n\nA. Thymidylate synthase\n\nB. Dihydrofolate reductase\n\nC. Serine hydroxymethyltransferase\n\nD. Methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase\n\nE. Formyl-methenyl-methylenetetrahydrofolate synthetase", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the enzyme inhibited by compound CP-401, given that its administration leads to the accumulation of Dihydrofolate (DHF) and an inhibition of DNA synthesis. To solve this, we must analyze the role of folate derivatives in nucleotide biosynthesis.\n\nStep 1: Understand the role of folate in DNA synthesis.\nTetrahydrofolate (THF) and its derivatives are essential cofactors that carry one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are critical for the synthesis of certain amino acids (like methionine) and nucleotides (both purines and the pyrimidine, thymine). The inhibition of DNA synthesis points towards a disruption in the supply of nucleotide precursors.\n\nStep 2: Connect DHF to a specific nucleotide synthesis pathway.\nThe problem explicitly mentions that DHF is a product of the thymidylate synthesis reaction. Let's examine this reaction. The synthesis of deoxythymidylate (dTMP) from deoxyuridylate (dUMP) is catalyzed by the enzyme **thymidylate synthase**. This reaction is unique among THF-dependent reactions. The cofactor, $N^5,N^{10}$-Methylene-THF, donates not only its one-carbon methylene group but also a hydride ion, resulting in the cofactor itself being oxidized.\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\n$$ \\text{dUMP} + N^5,N^{10}\\text{-Methylene-THF} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Thymidylate synthase}} \\text{dTMP} + \\text{DHF} $$\n\nStep 3: Analyze the fate of DHF.\nAs seen from the reaction above, the synthesis of dTMP, a necessary precursor for DNA replication, consumes $N^5,N^{10}$-Methylene-THF and produces DHF. For DNA synthesis to continue, especially in rapidly dividing cells like cancer cells, the pool of THF derivatives must be constantly regenerated. This means the DHF produced must be converted back into THF.\n\nStep 4: Identify the enzyme responsible for regenerating THF from DHF.\nThe reduction of DHF back to THF is a crucial step in the folate cycle. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme **Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)**. It uses NADPH as the reducing agent.\n\nThe reaction is:\n$$ \\text{DHF} + \\text{NADPH} + \\text{H}^{+} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Dihydrofolate reductase}} \\text{THF} + \\text{NADP}^{+} $$\n\nStep 5: Synthesize the information to identify the target of CP-401.\nThe experimental observation is a significant accumulation of DHF. If DHF is accumulating, it means that its rate of production is exceeding its rate of removal. The primary pathway for DHF removal is its reduction to THF by DHFR. Therefore, an accumulation of DHF strongly implies that the DHFR enzyme is being inhibited. When DHFR is inhibited, the cell cannot regenerate THF, leading to a depletion of all THF derivatives, including the $N^5,N^{10}$-Methylene-THF required for dTMP synthesis. This explains the observed inhibition of DNA synthesis.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the other options to confirm the conclusion.\nA. **Thymidylate synthase:** If this enzyme were inhibited, the conversion of dUMP to dTMP would stop. This would halt the production of DHF from this pathway. Therefore, DHF would not accumulate. This is incorrect.\nC. **Serine hydroxymethyltransferase:** This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of THF to $N^5,N^{10}$-Methylene-THF (using serine as the one-carbon donor). Inhibiting this enzyme would reduce the supply of $N^5,N^{10}$-Methylene-THF, slowing dTMP synthesis, but it would not directly cause an accumulation of DHF.\nD. **Methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR):** This enzyme reduces $N^5,N^{10}$-Methylene-THF to $N^5$-methyl-THF, which is primarily used for methionine synthesis. Its inhibition would not directly lead to DHF accumulation.\nE. **Formyl-methenyl-methylenetetrahydrofolate synthetase:** This is a multifunctional enzyme involved in the interconversion of THF derivatives for purine synthesis. Its inhibition would affect purine synthesis but would not cause a buildup of DHF.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only logical conclusion is that CP-401 inhibits Dihydrofolate reductase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2079793"}, {"introduction": "Cellular metabolism is not a homogenous mix of reactions; it is highly organized into compartments like the cytosol and mitochondria. This practice explores the crucial consequences of this compartmentalization for one-carbon metabolism. You will unravel a metabolic puzzle explaining why a cell can synthesize thymidine but not purines, highlighting how different biosynthetic pathways depend on one-carbon units from distinct intracellular sources. [@problem_id:2079732]", "problem": "One-carbon metabolism, mediated by the cofactor Tetrahydrofolate (THF), is essential for the synthesis of purines and thymidine. This metabolism is compartmentalized between the cytosol and mitochondria. The cytosolic branch is largely driven by the trifunctional enzyme MTHFD1 (methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase/synthetase), which interconverts various one-carbon-loaded THF species. The mitochondrial branch can generate one-carbon units primarily through the Glycine Cleavage System (GCS), which catabolizes glycine.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered mammalian cell line that has a complete loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the cytosolic MTHFD1 enzyme. These cells are cultured in a medium that lacks purines and thymidine, but is supplemented with a high concentration of glycine. It is observed that these cells are auxotrophic for purines (i.e., they require an external source of purines to grow) but are not auxotrophic for thymidine (i.e., they can synthesize their own thymidine).\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate biochemical explanation for this specific metabolic phenotype?\n\nA. The mitochondrial GCS uses glycine to produce $N^5,N^{10}$-methylene-THF. This is used to synthesize serine, which is exported to the cytosol. There, cytosolic enzymes convert serine back to glycine, regenerating the $N^5,N^{10}$-methylene-THF needed for thymidylate synthesis. However, purine synthesis requires $N^{10}$-formyl-THF, and the final step of its generation in the cytosol from formate (exported from mitochondria) is catalyzed by the absent MTHFD1.\n\nB. The mitochondrial one-carbon pathway can only produce $N^5,N^{10}$-methylene-THF, which is the direct substrate for thymidylate synthesis, but not the $N^{10}$-formyl-THF required for purine synthesis.\n\nC. Purine synthesis and thymidylate synthesis both occur exclusively in the mitochondria, but the transport of purine precursors out of the mitochondria is dependent on MTHFD1 function in the cytosol.\n\nD. Thymidylate synthase, the enzyme that produces thymidine, relocates to the mitochondria in MTHFD1-deficient cells, allowing it to directly use one-carbon units generated by the GCS. Purine synthesis enzymes remain in the cytosol and are thus starved of one-carbon units.\n\nE. Glycine can be directly incorporated into the thymidine ring structure without the need for a THF carrier, whereas purine synthesis is strictly dependent on THF-mediated one-carbon transfers which are blocked by the MTHFD1 deletion.", "solution": "The genetic lesion removes cytosolic MTHFD1, a trifunctional enzyme with dehydrogenase, cyclohydrolase, and formyl-THF synthetase activities that interconvert one-carbon THF species and generate $N^{10}$-formyl-THF in the cytosol.

Although mitochondria can generate and export one-carbon units as formate, the cytosol cannot convert formate to $N^{10}$-Formyl-THF without MTHFD1. Consequently, the purine pathway is starved of $N^{10}$-Formyl-THF, causing purine auxotrophy, while thymidylate synthesis remains supported by the serine–SHMT1–$N^5,N^{10}$-Methylene-THF axis.\n\nTherefore, the only option that accurately captures the mitochondrial provision of one-carbon units for thymidylate synthesis via serine/SHMT1, coupled with the specific block of cytosolic $N^{10}$-Formyl-THF generation for purines due to loss of MTHFD1, is option A.
