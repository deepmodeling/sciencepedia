This practice delves into the sophisticated functions of ATP in an enzymatic reaction by analyzing data from experiments using a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog.

The overall reaction is: S1 + S2 + ATP → P + ADP + $\\mathrm{P}_i$. To elucidate the specific roles of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) in the reaction mechanism, the biochemist conducts two distinct sets of experiments.\n\n**Experiment 1: Measurement of Reaction Velocity**\nThe initial velocity ($v_0$) of product P formation was measured under three different conditions, each containing saturating concentrations of substrates S1 and S2.\n*   **Condition I:** Fictoligase + S1 + S2\n*   **Condition II:** Fictoligase + S1 + S2 + ATP\n*   **Condition III:** Fictoligase + S1 + S2 + adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), a non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP.\n\nThe observed initial velocities were as follows:\n*   In Condition I: a velocity of 0 was observed.\n*   In Condition II: a maximal velocity, $V_{\\max}$, was observed.\n*   In Condition III: a velocity of 0 was observed.\n\n**Experiment 2: Measurement of Substrate Binding Affinity**\nUsing the technique of equilibrium dialysis, the dissociation constant ($K_d$) for the binding of substrate S1 to Fictoligase was determined in the absence and presence of either ATP or its analog.\n*   **Condition A:** Fictoligase + S1 (in the absence of any nucleotide). The measured $K_d$ was 100 µM.\n*   **Condition B:** Fictoligase + S1 + ATP. The $K_d$ could not be determined because the substrates were rapidly converted to product.\n*   **Condition C:** Fictoligase + S1 + AMP-PNP. The measured $K_d$ was 5.0 µM.\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of the results from both experiments, which of the following statements most accurately describes the function of ATP in the Fictoligase reaction mechanism?\n\nA. ATP's sole function is to provide the free energy for the ligation reaction through its hydrolysis; its binding to the enzyme has no significant effect on the enzyme's affinity for its substrates.\n\nB. ATP's sole function is to act as an allosteric effector that induces a conformational change required for catalytic activity, but the hydrolysis of ATP is not itself necessary for the ligation reaction to occur.\n\nC. ATP serves a dual role in two distinct steps: first, its binding to the enzyme induces a conformational change that significantly increases the enzyme's affinity for its substrates, and second, its subsequent hydrolysis provides the necessary chemical energy to drive the covalent ligation step.\n\nD. The binding of ATP to the enzyme reduces its affinity for substrate S1. This thermodynamically unfavorable binding event is overcome by the large negative free energy change associated with ATP hydrolysis, which then drives the reaction forward.\n\nE. Both ATP and its analog AMP-PNP act as simple competitive inhibitors with respect to substrate S1, preventing it from binding to the active site.", "solution": "The overall reaction is $S1 + S2 + \\mathrm{ATP} \\to P + \\mathrm{ADP} + \\mathrm{P_{i}}$, so ATP could contribute either through binding effects (allostery) or through hydrolysis (chemical driving force), or both.\n\nFor Experiment 1, with saturating $[S1]$ and $[S2]$, the Michaelis–Menten relation gives $v_{0}=V_{\\max}=k_{\\mathrm{cat}}[E]_{\\mathrm{T}}$ if the catalytic step is permitted. In Condition I (no nucleotide), $v_{0}=0$ implies $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}=0$ in the absence of ATP, so ATP is required for turnover. In Condition II (ATP present), $v_{0}=V_{\\max}$, showing ATP enables catalysis. In Condition III (AMP-PNP present), $v_{0}=0$, demonstrating that mere binding of a nucleotide analog is insufficient and that the nonhydrolyzable analog cannot support the catalytic step; thus ATP hydrolysis (or a chemically equivalent step such as formation and breakdown of an adenylated intermediate) is necessary for product formation.\n\nFor Experiment 2, the dissociation constant for S1 binding is defined as $K_{d}=\\frac{[E][\\mathrm{S1}]}{[E\\mathrm{S1}]}=\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}$. In Condition A (no nucleotide), $K_{d}=100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. In Condition C (AMP-PNP present), $K_{d}=5.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. The reduction from $100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to $5.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ corresponds to a $20$-fold increase in affinity upon occupancy of the ATP-binding site by AMP-PNP, indicating that nucleotide binding induces a conformational change that enhances S1 binding. In Condition B (ATP present), $K_{d}$ cannot be measured because binding is followed by rapid catalysis, consistent with ATP both promoting high-affinity substrate binding (as inferred from the AMP-PNP result) and enabling turnover via hydrolysis.\n\nCombining the two experiments: (i) ATP binding to the enzyme allosterically increases affinity for S1, as shown by the AMP-PNP–induced decrease in $K_{d}$, and (ii) ATP hydrolysis is required for the ligation step since AMP-PNP, despite enhancing binding, yields $v_{0}=0$. Therefore ATP plays a dual role: binding-driven activation of substrate affinity and hydrolysis-driven chemical coupling. This directly supports option C and rules out the alternatives: A is false because nucleotide binding greatly affects $K_{d}$; B is false because hydrolysis is necessary for catalysis; D is false because nucleotide binding increases, not decreases, S1 affinity; E is false because AMP-PNP does not prevent S1 binding but strengthens it.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2044184"}, {"introduction": "The high specificity of enzymes for their cofactors is a result of finely tuned molecular interactions within the binding site.

The chemical distinction between NAD$^{+}$ and NADP$^{+}$ is the presence of a negatively charged 2'-phosphate on the adenosine ribose in NADP$^{+}$.\n\nPrinciple: Electrostatic interactions dominate recognition of the 2'-phosphate. A favorable interaction requires the introduction of a local positive charge or a hydrogen-bond donor arrangement that stabilizes the negatively charged phosphate group. Qualitatively, the electrostatic stabilization energy varies with the sign and magnitude of interacting charges and their separation distance, as in $U \\propto \\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r}$; introducing a positively charged side chain at the appropriate position can create $q_{1}q_{2} < 0$ (attractive) with the phosphate.\n\nCurrent state: The presence of Asp38 (negatively charged) near the adenosine ribose binding site is consistent with NAD$^{+}$ specificity because it can hydrogen bond to the 2'-hydroxyl of NAD$^{+}$ and will electrostatically repel a 2'-phosphate, disfavoring NADP$^{+}$ binding. Therefore, to switch specificity to NADP$^{+}$, a common and rational strategy is to replace an acidic residue that disfavors NADP$^{+}$ with a basic residue that can form favorable electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the 2'-phosphate.\n\nEvaluation of proposed single-point mutations:\n- G37P: Proline would rigidify and kink the local backbone, often disrupting the glycine-rich loop flexibility important for cofactor binding. It does not introduce a positive charge to stabilize the phosphate and may reduce binding in general. Not favored.\n- D38R: Replaces a negatively charged side chain (carboxylate) with a positively charged guanidinium that can engage in strong electrostatic attraction and multiple hydrogen bonds with the 2'-phosphate of NADP$^{+}$. This directly implements the needed chemical complementarity and is a well-established design principle for switching specificity toward NADP$^{+}$.\n- D38E: Conservative substitution retaining a negative charge at similar position and length; it would continue to repel the phosphate and thus preserve NAD$^{+}$ preference. Not favored.\n- V35L: Conservative hydrophobic change of similar size that does not create favorable interactions with a phosphate group; unlikely to affect cofactor preference meaningfully. Not favored.\n- A36S: Introduces a polar hydroxyl that could form hydrogen bonds, but without a positive charge it will not provide strong electrostatic stabilization for the phosphate. This is less likely to be sufficient for a specificity switch compared to introducing a basic residue.\n\nConclusion: The most effective single change to favor NADP$^{+}$ is to replace Asp38 with a positively charged residue that can bind the 2'-phosphate. Among the options, Asp38 to Arginine best fulfills this requirement.\n\nTherefore, the most likely mutation to achieve the goal is D38R.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2044190"}]}
