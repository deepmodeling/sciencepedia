The reaction is catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase and proceeds in two steps. First, the fatty acid reacts with Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to form an acyl-adenylate intermediate and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). Second, the sulfhydryl group of CoA attacks the acyl-adenylate, displacing Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP) to form the final acyl-CoA product. The PPi produced in the first step is subsequently and rapidly hydrolyzed by inorganic pyrophosphatase into two molecules of inorganic phosphate (Pi).\n\nConsider the activation of linoleic acid, an essential polyunsaturated fatty acid.

This final practice explores this anabolic function through the elegant technique of isotopic tracing.

They prepare an *in vitro* system with all the necessary enzymes and cofactors, using pyruvate as the sole carbon source. The pyruvate is isotopically labeled with Carbon-14 exclusively at its carbonyl carbon (C-2). This labeled pyruvate is converted to acetyl-Coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The synthesis of palmitate (a 16-carbon saturated fatty acid) then proceeds by a cyclic process. First, a single 'priming' molecule of acetyl-CoA initiates the synthesis. Then, the chain is elongated through seven sequential rounds of condensation, with each round adding a two-carbon unit derived from another molecule of acetyl-CoA. By convention, the carboxyl carbon of the final palmitate molecule is designated C-1, and the terminal methyl carbon is designated C-16.

A key positional principle is that chain elongation occurs at the carboxyl (C-1) end of the growing acyl chain, while the original primer acetyl group becomes the terminal two carbons (the methyl end) of the final fatty acid. Consequently, the two carbons of the primer acetyl group map to the terminal positions of palmitate as follows:\n- The acetyl methyl carbon $A_2$ becomes C-16 (the terminal methyl carbon).\n- The acetyl carbonyl carbon $A_1$ becomes C-15 (the carbon adjacent to the terminal methyl).\n\nBecause the label resides on $A_1$, the first incorporation of $^{14}\\mathrm{C}$ into the palmitate skeleton occurs at the moment the priming acetyl group is used, placing the label at C-15. All subsequent two-carbon units are added at the carboxyl end and do not change the identity of the terminal two carbons derived from the primer.\n\nTherefore, considering the temporal sequence of events in synthesis, the first carbon of palmitate to incorporate $^{14}\\mathrm{C}$ is C-15.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2035411"}]}
