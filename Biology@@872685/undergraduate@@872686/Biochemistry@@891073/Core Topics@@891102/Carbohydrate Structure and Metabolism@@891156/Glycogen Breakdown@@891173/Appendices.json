This practice challenges you to quantify the output of these two activities, helping you determine the fundamental stoichiometric ratio of glucose-1-phosphate to free glucose produced during complete glycogenolysis.

Its catabolism, glycogenolysis, involves the sequential removal of glucose units from its non-reducing ends. This process is primarily accomplished by two enzymes: glycogen phosphorylase and the debranching enzyme.\n\nGlycogen phosphorylase catalyzes the phosphorolytic cleavage of $\\alpha(1 \\to 4)$ glycosidic bonds, yielding glucose-1-phosphate (G1P). However, this enzyme cannot cleave the $\\alpha(1 \\to 6)$ glycosidic bonds that form the branch points.\n\nThe debranching enzyme resolves these branch points. It has two catalytic activities. First, a transferase activity shifts a block of three glucose residues from the branch to a nearby non-reducing end. Second, an $\\alpha(1 \\to 6)$-glucosidase activity hydrolyzes the single remaining glucose residue at the branch point, releasing it as free, unphosphorylated glucose.\n\nConsider a large, hypothetical glycogen particle that possesses a perfectly regular structure where, on average, a branch point occurs for every 11 glucose residues.

The use of phosphorolysis by glycogen phosphorylase, rather than simple hydrolysis, is a key example of this principle, as it conserves the energy of the glycosidic bond. This exercise uses a compelling thought experiment involving arsenate, a phosphate analog, to demonstrate the significant ATP advantage of this mechanism, clarifying why the cell avoids producing free glucose directly from the glycogen chain.

The breakdown of glycogen, or glycogenolysis, is initiated by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase, which catalyzes the phosphorolytic cleavage of a glucose residue from a glycogen chain. Under normal physiological conditions, this reaction uses inorganic phosphate ($P_i$) to produce glucose-1-phosphate. This glucose-1-phosphate is then converted to glucose-6-phosphate, which enters the glycolytic pathway.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario within a liver cell where inorganic arsenate ($AsO_4^{3-}$), a chemical analog of phosphate, is present in high concentrations. Assume that glycogen phosphorylase can utilize arsenate as a substrate instead of phosphate, producing glucose-1-arsenate.
