This labeled G3P is then added to a cell-free extract containing all the necessary enzymes and cofactors for the payoff phase of glycolysis, allowing it to be converted to pyruvate. Assuming the pathway proceeds to completion, which carbon atom of the resulting pyruvate molecule will be radiolabeled?\n\nFor the purpose of this question, the carbons in pyruvate are numbered according to standard biochemical convention: C-1 is the carboxyl carbon, C-2 is the keto carbon, and C-3 is the methyl carbon.\n\nA.
