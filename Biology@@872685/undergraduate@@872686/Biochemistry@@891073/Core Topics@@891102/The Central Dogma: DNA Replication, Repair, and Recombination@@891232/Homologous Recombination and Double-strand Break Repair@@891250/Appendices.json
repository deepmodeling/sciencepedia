This first practice challenges you to consider the immediate fate of these vulnerable ssDNA overhangs and the crucial role of gatekeeper proteins like Replication Protein A (RPA) ([@problem_id:2050157]). By analyzing a scenario where RPA is non-functional, you will explore why stabilizing this initial intermediate is essential for the entire repair pathway to proceed.", "problem": "In a laboratory study of DNA repair mechanisms, a researcher develops a mutant strain of eukaryotic cells. This strain possesses a specific mutation in the gene encoding Replication Protein A (RPA), the primary single-strand binding protein complex in eukaryotes. The mutation renders the RPA complex completely unable to bind to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). These cells are then exposed to ionizing radiation, which induces numerous Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs) in their genomes. Cells normally repair such breaks via multiple pathways, including the high-fidelity Homologous Recombination (HR) pathway. The initial step of HR involves the processing of the DSB ends to generate 3' ssDNA overhangs. In wild-type cells, these overhangs are then coated by RPA. The recombinase enzyme, RAD51, subsequently assembles onto these overhangs to form a filament that is essential for searching for and invading a homologous DNA template to initiate repair.\n\nGiven the non-functional RPA in this mutant cell line, what is the most direct and immediate consequence that leads to the failure of the Homologous Recombination pathway following a DSB?\n\nA. The DNA ligase enzyme will be inhibited, preventing the final sealing of the repaired DNA strands.\n\nB. The resection process that generates the ssDNA overhangs will be hyperactivated, leading to excessively long strands that cannot be repaired.\n\nC. The ssDNA overhangs will be prone to forming stable secondary structures, thus preventing the proper assembly of the functional RAD51 nucleoprotein filament required for strand invasion.\n\nD. The cell will successfully complete HR, but with a much higher rate of mutation compared to wild-type cells.\n\nE. The RAD51 filament will form correctly on the ssDNA, but it will be unable to displace the mutated RPA from the strand, stalling the process.", "solution": "The homologous recombination pathway after a double-strand break proceeds through: (i) end resection to generate 3' single-stranded DNA overhangs, (ii) immediate coating of these ssDNA regions by Replication Protein A (RPA), which serves two essential functions: it prevents intramolecular base pairing and secondary structure formation on ssDNA, and it creates a proper substrate for mediator proteins (such as BRCA2) to load RAD51; (iii) assembly of a RAD51 nucleoprotein filament on ssDNA, which is required for homology search and strand invasion.\n\nGiven a mutant RPA that is completely unable to bind ssDNA, the earliest and most direct consequence occurs immediately after resection: the exposed ssDNA overhangs remain uncoated. Uncoated ssDNA is highly prone to forming stable secondary structures (for example, hairpins) and is also vulnerable to inappropriate annealing and nuclease attack. Critically, the formation of secondary structures and the absence of RPA-mediated substrate preparation prevent efficient and orderly assembly of the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament on ssDNA. Without a properly formed RAD51 filament, the homology search and strand invasion steps cannot proceed, causing failure of homologous recombination at an early stage.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because ligation is a late step; the defect arises earlier at RAD51 loading/filament formation.\n- B is not the most direct consequence; although RPA can influence resection dynamics, the defining immediate defect of RPA loss is failure to stabilize ssDNA and enable RAD51 filament assembly.\n- C is correct: uncoated ssDNA forms secondary structures, preventing proper RAD51 filament assembly.\n- D is incorrect because HR fails early rather than completing with increased mutation.\n- E is incorrect because the mutant RPA cannot bind ssDNA, so there is no RPA to displace; the block occurs before any RAD51 filament correctly forms.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate consequence is the prevention of proper RAD51 filament assembly due to secondary structure formation on ssDNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2050157"}, {"introduction": "After the initial strand invasion and DNA synthesis, homologous recombination can generate complex four-stranded intermediates known as double Holliday junctions. This exercise asks you to predict the outcome of specifically inhibiting the BLM helicase, a key enzyme involved in a non-crossover resolution pathway called dissolution ([@problem_id:2050204]). This problem highlights the cell's sophisticated machinery for untangling DNA and underscores the importance of specific enzymatic activities in maintaining genome integrity.", "problem": "In a cellular biology laboratory, researchers are studying the intricate pathways of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in a human fibroblast cell line. They introduce a novel synthetic compound, \"Helicasin-B,\" into the cell culture. Detailed biochemical analyses confirm that Helicasin-B is a highly specific, non-competitive inhibitor that exclusively targets the ATP-dependent helicase function of the Bloom syndrome protein (BLM), a key enzyme in homologous recombination. The inhibitor does not prevent the formation of the BLM protein complex with its partners, such as Topoisomerase III alpha, nor does it affect any other known helicases, polymerases, or nucleases involved in DNA metabolism. Following treatment with Helicasin-B, the researchers induce DSBs in the cells using ionizing radiation and monitor the molecular intermediates of the repair process.\n\nWhich of the following descriptions represents the most direct and prominent molecular consequence of inhibiting the BLM helicase activity during homologous recombination repair in these cells?\n\nA. A complete failure to form the presynaptic RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament, preventing the search for homology.\n\nB. An inability of the cell to perform the initial 5' to 3' resection of the DNA break ends, thus blocking the generation of 3' single-stranded overhangs.\n\nC. A significant accumulation of unresolved four-stranded DNA structures known as double Holliday junctions, leading to stalled repair.\n\nD. A specific block in the DNA synthesis step that extends the invading strand within the displacement loop (D-loop).\n\nE. A rapid degradation of the homologous donor DNA template immediately after strand invasion occurs.", "solution": "Homologous recombination repair of a DNA double-strand break proceeds through a defined sequence of molecular steps: resection of the 5' ends to generate 3' single-stranded overhangs, formation of a presynaptic RAD51-ssDNA filament, homology search and strand invasion to form a displacement loop, DNA synthesis to extend the invading 3' end, and capture of the second end to yield a double Holliday junction (dHJ) intermediate. The dHJ is then processed either by dissolution or by nucleolytic resolution.\n\nThe Bloom syndrome protein (BLM) is an ATP-dependent RecQ-family helicase that plays two principal roles in homologous recombination: (i) it cooperates with DNA2 to promote long-range 5' to 3' resection, redundantly with EXO1; and (ii) it is the motor of the BLM-Topoisomerase III alpha-RMI1/2 complex that catalyzes convergent branch migration of the two Holliday junctions of a dHJ, transforming them into a hemicatenane that Topoisomerase III alpha decatenates. This latter process, termed dissolution, produces non-crossover products and suppresses sister chromatid exchange.\n\nGiven that Helicasin-B is a highly specific, non-competitive inhibitor that blocks only the ATP-dependent helicase activity of BLM while preserving complex formation with Topoisomerase III alpha and does not affect other helicases, polymerases, or nucleases:\n\n1. Initial 5' to 3' resection is initiated by MRN-CtIP and extended by either EXO1 or the BLM-DNA2 pathway. Because EXO1 remains active and the inhibitor targets only BLM’s helicase, the initial generation of 3' overhangs is not abrogated. Therefore, a complete inability to perform initial resection is not the direct consequence, invalidating option B.\n\n2. Formation of the RAD51-ssDNA presynaptic filament depends on RPA displacement by BRCA2 and RAD51 loading. BLM is not required for the formation of this filament, so a complete failure of RAD51 filament assembly is not expected, invalidating option A.\n\n3. DNA synthesis within the displacement loop is carried out by replicative polymerases and is not directly dependent on BLM helicase activity; BLM can, in some contexts, disrupt D-loops, but inhibiting BLM does not specifically block polymerase-mediated extension of the invading strand, invalidating option D.\n\n4. Degradation of the donor template immediately post-strand invasion is not a known direct consequence of BLM helicase inhibition, and no mechanism in this setup targets the donor DNA for rapid degradation, invalidating option E.\n\n5. Dissolution of dHJs strictly requires the ATP-dependent helicase activity of BLM to drive convergent branch migration. Although the complex with Topoisomerase III alpha can still form, without BLM’s helicase activity the dissolution reaction cannot proceed. Consequently, dHJs accumulate because nucleolytic resolvases (e.g., MUS81-EME1, GEN1, SLX1-SLX4) either act later or only partially compensate, producing a prominent build-up of unresolved four-stranded junction intermediates. This is the most direct and prominent molecular consequence, validating option C.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the significant accumulation of unresolved double Holliday junctions due to failure of BLM-driven dissolution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2050204"}, {"introduction": "While homologous recombination is often described as an error-free repair mechanism, its fidelity is entirely dependent on the DNA template used for repair. This final practice explores a critical scenario where the template is a homologous chromosome carrying a pre-existing mutation ([@problem_id:2050149]). Understanding this process, known as gene conversion leading to Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH), reveals how a high-fidelity repair pathway can have significant genetic consequences, particularly in the context of cancer development.", "problem": "A researcher is studying a diploid human somatic cell line that is heterozygous for a critical tumor suppressor gene. One chromosome carries the functional wild-type allele, which we will denote as `TSG(+)`. The homologous chromosome carries a non-functional mutant allele, denoted as `TSG(-)`. The mutation in `TSG(-)` is a single nucleotide polymorphism that creates a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated, non-functional protein.\n\nThe cell culture is exposed to a chemical agent known to cause DNA Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs). A specific cell sustains a DSB located directly within the coding sequence of the wild-type `TSG(+)` allele. The cell attempts to repair this damage using the homologous recombination pathway. In this instance, the repair machinery uses the intact homologous chromosome, which carries the `TSG(-)` allele, as a template to synthesize the DNA sequence needed to fill the gap at the break site. Assuming the repair process proceeds to completion via a gene conversion event without an associated crossover, what is the most likely genotype of this specific cell at the `TSG` locus after the repair?\n\nA. The genotype becomes `TSG(+) / TSG(+)`.\n\nB. The genotype is restored to the original `TSG(+) / TSG(-)`.\n\nC. The cell undergoes apoptosis because repair with a mutant template is impossible.\n\nD. The genotype becomes `TSG(-) / TSG(-)`.\n\nE. The break is repaired, but both `TSG` alleles are now permanently silenced through epigenetic mechanisms.", "solution": "The starting genotype at the locus is heterozygous: one chromosome carries a functional wild-type allele denoted TSG(+), and the homolog carries a non-functional mutant allele denoted TSG(-). A DNA double-strand break occurs within the coding sequence of the TSG(+) allele.\n\nHomologous recombination repair proceeds by resection of the DSB ends and strand invasion into an intact homologous template. In this case, the intact template is the homolog carrying TSG(-). DNA polymerase then extends the invading strand by copying sequence information from the donor template. When the donor template carries a mutation, gene conversion can non-reciprocally transfer that mutant sequence into the broken allele during repair synthesis.\n\nThe problem states that the repair proceeds to completion via a gene conversion event without crossover. A non-crossover gene conversion results in the broken allele adopting the sequence of the template over the conversion tract. Because the template is TSG(-) and the break lies within the coding sequence that includes the mutant site (a premature stop codon), the repaired allele will be converted from TSG(+) to TSG(-) at that site, producing loss of heterozygosity at the TSG locus.\n\nTherefore, after repair the cell’s genotype at the locus is TSG(-) on both homologs. Repair using a mutant template is mechanistically feasible and does not necessitate apoptosis, and there is no basis here for epigenetic silencing of both alleles. Likewise, conversion to TSG(+) on both alleles is not supported because the donor template is mutant.\n\nThus, the most likely post-repair genotype is TSG(-) / TSG(-).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2050149"}]}
