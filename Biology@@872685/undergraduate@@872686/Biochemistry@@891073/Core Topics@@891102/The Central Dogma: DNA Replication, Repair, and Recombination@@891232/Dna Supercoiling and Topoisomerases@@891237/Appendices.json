This thought experiment explores how a change in helical pitch, driven by buffer conditions, forces a relaxed plasmid to adopt a supercoiled conformation. By working through this problem, you will gain a deeper intuition for the immutable nature of the linking number, $Lk$, and the dynamic interplay between twist ($Tw$) and writhe ($Wr$) [@problem_id:2041916].", "problem": "A molecular biologist is studying the topological properties of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). A linear DNA fragment of 4200 base pairs (bp) is synthesized with complementary single-stranded overhangs.

The plasmid is treated with the enzyme Topoisomerase I, which systematically alters the DNA topology until all superhelical tension is released and the molecule is fully relaxed. Following this relaxation, the Topoisomerase I enzyme is irreversibly inactivated and removed from the solution.\n\nNext, the purified, relaxed plasmid is transferred into a new experimental buffer (Buffer B) containing a high concentration of salt. This change in the ionic environment alters the hydration shell of the DNA, causing the helical pitch to decrease to 10.0 bp per turn.

In Buffer A, the helical pitch is $h_A = 10.5$ base pairs per turn. Topoisomerase I is applied until the DNA is fully relaxed, which sets the linking number to the relaxed value in Buffer A:\n$$\nLk = Lk_0^A = \\frac{N}{h_A} = \\frac{4200}{10.5} = 400.\n$$\nAfter Topoisomerase I is removed, $Lk$ is fixed at $400$.\n\nIn Buffer B, the helical pitch changes to $h_B=10.0$ base pairs per turn, so the relaxed (preferred) twist in Buffer B is\n$$\nTw_0^B = \\frac{N}{h_B} = \\frac{4200}{10.0} = 420.\n$$\nWith $Lk$ constrained to remain $400$ and the molecule adjusting its tertiary structure (writhe) to accommodate the new helical winding, the twist minimizes torsional strain by matching the local relaxed value, so we take $Tw = Tw_0^B = 420$.

The goal is to determine its mechanistic classification among the topoisomerases. To achieve this, a controlled experiment is conducted using a highly purified preparation of a single topoisomer of a closed circular plasmid Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). This plasmid population is uniformly and negatively supercoiled.\n\nThe plasmid preparation is incubated with a catalytic amount of Relaxase at an optimal temperature for a short period. This limited reaction time ensures that the enzyme acts on only a portion of the plasmids, resulting in a mixture of products. The reaction is then stopped, and the resulting DNA mixture is analyzed using high-resolution agarose gel electrophoresis, a technique sensitive enough to separate topoisomers that differ by a single unit in their linking number.\n\nThe analysis reveals a distinct pattern on the gel. A prominent band corresponding to the original, untreated negatively supercoiled plasmid is observed. Additionally, a ladder of several fainter bands is seen, which migrate more slowly than the original plasmid. Careful calibration and analysis of this ladder show that these bands correspond to plasmid topoisomers whose linking numbers have changed from the original value by increments of +2, +4, +6, and so on, progressively approaching the linking number of the fully relaxed circular DNA. Critically, no bands corresponding to linking number changes of +1, +3, +5, etc., are detected.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following is the most accurate conclusion about the enzyme Relaxase?\n\nA. Relaxase is a Type I topoisomerase because it relaxes negative supercoils.\n\nB. Relaxase is a Type II topoisomerase because it changes the linking number in steps of two.\n\nC. Relaxase is a Type I topoisomerase because it generates a ladder of topoisomer products on a gel.\n\nD. Relaxase is a Type II topoisomerase because its function is dependent on Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nE. The experiment is inconclusive because the reaction was not allowed to proceed to completion.", "solution": "We consider the topological parameter linking number $Lk$ for covalently closed circular DNA, which is an integer and can change only via strand breakage and resealing. The relationship $Lk = Tw + Wr$ holds, where $Tw$ is twist and $Wr$ is writhe. In a uniformly negatively supercoiled plasmid, $Lk$ is less than the relaxed linking number, so relaxation corresponds to an increase in $Lk$.\n\nTopoisomerases change $Lk$ in discrete steps determined by their catalytic mechanism:\n- Type I topoisomerases introduce a transient single-strand break and change $Lk$ by $\\Delta Lk = \\pm 1$ per catalytic cycle.\n- Type II topoisomerases introduce a transient double-strand break and pass one duplex segment through another, changing $Lk$ by $\\Delta Lk = \\pm 2$ per catalytic cycle.\n\nIn a limiting reaction where only a fraction of molecules is acted upon, the product distribution reveals the step size of $\\Delta Lk$ as a ladder of topoisomers on an agarose gel. The experimental observation shows bands corresponding to changes in linking number of $+2, +4, +6, \\ldots$ relative to the starting negatively supercoiled plasmid, with no bands at $+1, +3, +5, \\ldots$. This pattern unequivocally indicates that the enzyme alters $Lk$ only in even increments, consistent with $\\Delta Lk = \\pm 2$ per event, which is diagnostic of a Type II topoisomerase.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because although Type I enzymes can relax negative supercoils, they would produce products with $\\Delta Lk = +1, +3, +5, \\ldots$ under limiting conditions; the absence of odd changes contradicts Type I.\n- B is correct because the observed even-step changes in $Lk$ are characteristic of Type II topoisomerases.\n- C is incorrect because a ladder of topoisomers under partial reaction conditions can be produced by both Type I and Type II; the crucial diagnostic is the step size, not the mere presence of a ladder.\n- D is unsupported by the experiment; ATP dependence was not tested or inferred from the gel pattern alone, so ATP dependence cannot be concluded here even though many Type II enzymes require ATP.\n- E is incorrect; completion is not necessary to deduce the step size of $\\Delta Lk$ from the partial product ladder.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that Relaxase is a Type II topoisomerase because it changes the linking number in steps of two.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2041966"}]}
