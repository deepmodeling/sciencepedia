This first exercise allows you to calculate the final error rate of a DNA polymerase by combining its intrinsic mistake frequency with the efficiency of its correction mechanism.

This enzyme is responsible for replicating the organism's genome. Through in vitro assays, the biochemist determines that ChronoPol has an intrinsic misincorporation rate, which is the frequency of adding an incorrect nucleotide before any correction. This rate is found to be one incorrect nucleotide for every 100,000 bases incorporated. The ChronoPol enzyme also possesses a $3' \\to 5'$ exonuclease activity that provides a \"proofreading\" function. This proofreading mechanism is highly efficient: for every 100 incorrect nucleotides that are incorporated, the proofreading activity successfully identifies and removes 99 of them.\n\nAssuming these two processes—misincorporation and proofreading—are the only factors determining replication fidelity, calculate the final, overall error rate of the ChronoPol enzyme.

The researcher prepares an in vitro reaction mixture containing this polymerase, a single-stranded DNA template, and a short DNA primer that is complementary to the template except for a single, deliberate mismatch at its 3'-terminus. All four deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) are also present in the buffer at optimal concentrations.\n\nImmediately after the polymerase binds to the primer-template junction, which of the following enzymatic actions will it perform first?\n\nA. It will catalyze the formation of a phosphodiester bond, adding the correct nucleotide specified by the template, effectively extending the mismatched primer.\n\nB.

It will unwind the DNA ahead of the primer using an intrinsic helicase activity.", "solution": "We are told the enzyme possesses $5' \\to 3'$ polymerase activity and $3' \\to 5'$ proofreading exonuclease activity. The primer ends with a single mismatched nucleotide at its $3'$ terminus, and all four dNTPs are present.\n\nFirst, recall the chemical requirement for $5' \\to 3'$ polymerization: the primer’s $3'$-hydroxyl must be correctly base-paired and geometrically aligned to perform a nucleophilic attack on the $\\alpha$-phosphate of the incoming dNTP, forming a new phosphodiester bond and releasing pyrophosphate. Symbolically, the extension step can be represented as:\n$$\n\\text{primer-}3'\\text{-OH} + \\text{dNTP} \\to \\text{primer-}3'\\text{-O-P} + \\text{PP}_{\\text{i}}.\n$$\nHigh-fidelity DNA polymerases achieve fidelity by coupling stringent geometric selection in the polymerase active site with a separate $3' \\to 5'$ exonuclease site that removes misincorporated nucleotides. A $3'$-terminal mismatch distorts the primer-template duplex at the active site, misaligning the $3'$-OH and markedly reducing the rate of phosphodiester bond formation. Under these conditions, the enzyme preferentially transfers the primer terminus to the exonuclease site, where the terminal (mismatched) nucleotide is hydrolytically removed in the $3' \\to 5'$ direction, regenerating a correctly paired $3'$-OH that can then be efficiently extended.\n\nTherefore, immediately after binding to a primer-template junction with a $3'$-end mismatch, a high-fidelity polymerase will not extend the mismatched primer (contradicting option A), but will instead activate its $3' \\to 5'$ proofreading exonuclease to excise the mismatch. It does not use a $5' \\to 3'$ exonuclease to degrade from the $5'$ end (option C is incorrect and not a proofreading function of such polymerases), it does not dissociate by default (option D is inconsistent with proofreading), and helicase activity is not intrinsic to typical high-fidelity DNA polymerases (option E is incorrect).\n\nHence, the first enzymatic action is removal of the mismatched $3'$ nucleotide via $3' \\to 5'$ exonuclease activity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2040785"}, {"introduction": "Maintaining genomic accuracy is not a passive process; it comes at a significant energetic cost to the cell. This final practice problem delves into the bioenergetics of proofreading by asking you to tally the number of high-energy phosphate bonds consumed during a single error-correction cycle.

DNA polymerases achieve remarkable accuracy through a 'proofreading' mechanism. This process involves a $3' \\to 5'$ exonuclease activity that can remove a newly added, incorrect nucleotide. While this significantly enhances accuracy, it comes at an energetic cost.\n\nConsider a single event during DNA replication where a DNA polymerase incorporates an incorrect deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) onto the 3' end of a growing DNA strand. The enzyme immediately detects the error and removes the incorrect nucleotide as a deoxynucleoside monophosphate (dNMP) using its proofreading exonuclease activity, restoring the strand to its state just before the incorrect addition.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, a 'high-energy phosphate bond' refers to a phosphoanhydride bond, such as those found in dNTPs and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). The incorporation of any dNTP is driven forward by the subsequent and essentially irreversible hydrolysis of the released PPi into two molecules of inorganic phosphate (Pi).\n\nCalculate the total number of high-energy phosphate bonds that are consumed during one complete cycle of incorrect nucleotide incorporation and its immediate removal by proofreading.", "solution": "The incorrect incorporation step is the same chemical process as a correct addition. Let $\\text{DNA}_{n}$ denote a primer with $n$ nucleotides.
