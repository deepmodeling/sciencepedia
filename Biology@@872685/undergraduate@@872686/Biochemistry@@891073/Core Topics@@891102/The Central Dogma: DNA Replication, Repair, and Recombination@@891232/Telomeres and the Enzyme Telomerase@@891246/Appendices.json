These structures protect the chromosome from degradation and fusion with other chromosomes. During DNA replication, a small portion of the chromosome's end is lost—a phenomenon called the \"end replication problem.\" The enzyme telomerase counteracts this shortening by adding telomeric DNA repeats to the 3' end of the chromosome. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase, meaning it synthesizes DNA using its own integral Telomerase RNA (TR) component as a template.\n\nImagine a pathogenic organism induces a specific mutation in human cells that alters the template region of the TR component of telomerase. The normal human TR template sequence is 3'-AAUCCC-5', leading to the synthesis of the 5'-TTAGGG-3' DNA repeat. The mutation, however, changes the template sequence to 3'-ACCACC-5'.\n\nWhat would be the sequence of the new single DNA strand synthesized by this mutated telomerase, written in the 5' to 3' direction?\n\nA. 5'-TGGTGG-3'\n\nB. 5'-UGGUGG-3'\n\nC. 5'-GGTGGT-3'\n\nD. 5'-ACCACC-3'\n\nE. 5'-CCACCA-3'", "solution": "The problem asks for the DNA sequence synthesized by a mutated telomerase enzyme. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the mechanism of telomerase and the rules of nucleic acid base pairing.\n\nTelomerase is a reverse transcriptase, an enzyme that synthesizes a Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) strand from a Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) template. The synthesis follows the principle of complementarity and occurs in an antiparallel fashion. This means the new DNA strand is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction while the enzyme reads the RNA template in the 3' to 5' direction.\n\nThe rules for base pairing between an RNA template and a newly synthesized DNA strand are as follows:\n- Adenine (A) in the RNA template pairs with Thymine (T) in the DNA strand.\n- Cytosine (C) in the RNA template pairs with Guanine (G) in the DNA strand.\n- Guanine (G) in the RNA template pairs with Cytosine (C) in the DNA strand.\n- Uracil (U) in the RNA template pairs with Adenine (A) in the DNA strand.\n\nThe mutated Telomerase RNA (TR) template sequence is given as 3'-ACCACC-5'. We will determine the sequence of the complementary DNA strand synthesized from this template, base by base, starting from the 3' end of the template. This corresponds to the 5' end of the new DNA strand.\n\n1.  The first base at the 3' end of the RNA template is A. Its complementary base in DNA is T. So, the 5' end of the new DNA strand starts with T.\n2.  The second base in the template is C. Its complementary base in DNA is G.\n3.  The third base in the template is C. Its complementary base in DNA is G.\n4.  The fourth base in the template is A. Its complementary base in DNA is T.\n5.  The fifth base in the template is C. Its complementary base in DNA is G.\n6.  The sixth base in the template is C. Its complementary base in DNA is G.\n\nAssembling these bases in the order they are synthesized (5' to 3'), we get the sequence 5'-TGGTGG-3'.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\nA. 5'-TGGTGG-3': This matches our derived sequence.\nB. 5'-UGGUGG-3': This sequence contains Uracil (U). DNA strands contain Thymine (T), not Uracil. This would be an RNA sequence complementary to the template.\nC. 5'-GGTGGT-3': This is the reverse of the correct sequence, which would result from an incorrect assumption about the direction of synthesis or reading.\nD. 5'-ACCACC-3': This is the sequence of the template itself, not the synthesized DNA strand.\nE. 5'-CCACCA-3': This is the reverse of the template sequence.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence for the newly synthesized DNA strand is 5'-TGGTGG-3'.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2078652"}, {"introduction": "Building on the mechanism of synthesis, we now zoom out to consider the long-term dynamics of telomere length over many cell generations.

At the start of the experiment (0 cell divisions), the average telomere length in the cell population is measured to be $L_0$. These primary cells exhibit negligible telomerase activity, and it is observed that, on average, they lose $d$ base pairs from their telomeres with each cell division due to the end-replication problem.\n\nAfter the cell culture undergoes $N_1$ divisions, the researchers successfully transfect the cells with a gene that causes the constitutive expression of a highly active telomerase enzyme.

This scenario is particularly important in cancer biology, where mutations can alter enzyme function in complex ways.

This process yields two isoforms: a full-length, catalytically active wild-type protein (WT-TERT) and a shorter, dominant-negative isoform (DN-TERT). The DN-TERT protein retains its full affinity for the telomeric DNA substrate but completely lacks the catalytic domain required for DNA synthesis. It therefore acts as a pure competitive inhibitor of the active telomerase enzyme.\n\nLet's model the kinetics of this system. The total concentration of all TERT protein in the cell, $[TERT]_{\\text{total}}$, is constant. A fraction $f$ of this total protein is the active WT-TERT, while the remaining fraction $(1-f)$ is the inhibitory DN-TERT. Thus, the concentration of the active enzyme is $[E] = f[TERT]_{\\text{total}}$ and the concentration of the inhibitor is $[I] = (1-f)[TERT]_{\\text{total}}$.\n\nThe Michaelis constant of the active telomerase enzyme for its telomeric DNA substrate ($S$) is $K_M$. Because the DN-TERT isoform retains identical binding properties, its inhibition constant, $K_I$, is equal to $K_M$.\n\nYour task is to derive an expression for the fractional telomerase activity, $A_{\\text{frac}}$. This is defined as the ratio of the enzyme's reaction velocity in this cell ($v$) to a reference velocity ($v_{\\text{ref}}$) that would be observed if all TERT protein were the wild-type form (i.e., at $f=1$).
