The suspension is supplied with ample oxygen, ADP, inorganic phosphate, as well as substrates that can be utilized by both Complex I and Complex II of the Electron Transport Chain (ETC). Specifically, glutamate is provided as a source of NADH for Complex I, and succinate is provided as a direct substrate for Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase).\n\nThe system is allowed to reach a steady state of respiration. At this point, a researcher introduces a significant amount of malonate into the suspension. Malonate is a molecule structurally similar to succinate and is known to be a potent competitive inhibitor of Complex II.\n\nAssuming Complex I continues to function normally, predict the immediate effect of malonate addition on the overall redox state of the Coenzyme Q (CoQ) pool and the electron carriers within Complex III (cytochrome bc1 complex). For the purpose of this question, \"becoming more oxidized\" implies an increase in the ratio of the oxidized form to the reduced form of the molecule pool, while \"becoming more reduced\" implies a decrease in this ratio.\n\nA.

Let the total CoQ pool be conserved, $Q_{\\text{tot}}=[Q]+[QH_{2}]$, and define the reduced fraction $f=[QH_{2}]/Q_{\\text{tot}}$.\n\nElectron-flux balance for the CoQ pool can be written as\n$$\n\\frac{d[QH_{2}]}{dt}=J_{I\\to Q}+J_{II\\to Q}-J_{Q\\to III},\n$$\nwhere $J_{I\\to Q}$ is the electron influx from Complex I (via NADH), $J_{II\\to Q}$ is the electron influx from Complex II (via succinate), and $J_{Q\\to III}$ is the electron efflux from CoQ to Complex III.\n\nBefore malonate, in the steady state,\n$$\n0=\\frac{d[QH_{2}]}{dt}\\implies J_{Q\\to III}=J_{I\\to Q}+J_{II\\to Q}.\n$$\nUpon addition of malonate, a potent competitive inhibitor of Complex II, $J_{II\\to Q}$ decreases markedly, while Complex I remains functional so $J_{I\\to Q}$ is unchanged.

The oxidation of succinate to fumarate involves the transfer of two electrons to FAD, forming FADH$_{2}$. This occurs at Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) of the Electron Transport Chain (ETC).\n\nThe two electrons from FADH$_{2}$ are then passed down the ETC as follows:\n1.  Complex II to Coenzyme Q (Ubiquinone). Complex II does not pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n2.  Coenzyme Q carries the electrons to Complex III (Cytochrome bc$_{1}$ complex). For every two electrons that pass through Complex III, four protons are pumped from the matrix to the IMS.\n3.  From Complex III, the electrons are transferred via Cytochrome c to Complex IV (Cytochrome c oxidase). For every two electrons that pass through Complex IV to reduce half a molecule of O$_{2}$ to H$_{2}$O, two protons are pumped from the matrix to the IMS.\n\nSince the electrons from succinate bypass Complex I, we only consider the protons pumped by Complexes III and IV.\nTotal protons pumped per succinate molecule (which yields 2 electrons) = (Protons from Complex III) + (Protons from Complex IV) = 4 H$^{+}$ + 2 H$^{+}$ = 6 H$^{+}$.\nTherefore, for every mole of succinate oxidized, 6 moles of protons are translocated from the matrix to the IMS.\n\nNext, we calculate the total moles of protons, $\\Delta n_{\\text{H}^{+}}$, pumped into the IMS.\nGiven the moles of succinate, $n_{\\text{succ}} = 3.00 \\times 10^{-8}$ mol.\n$$ \\Delta n_{\\text{H}^{+}} = n_{\\text{succ}} \\times 6 = (3.00 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ mol}) \\times 6 = 1.80 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ mol} $$\n\nNow, we determine the change in the molar concentration of protons, $\\Delta[H^{+}]$, in the IMS.
