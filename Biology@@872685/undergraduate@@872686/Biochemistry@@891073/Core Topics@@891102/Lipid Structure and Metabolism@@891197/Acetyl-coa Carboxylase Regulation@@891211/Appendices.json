This exercise explores the principle of allosteric activation by examining a hypothetical drug designed to mimic citrate, a key indicator of carbon abundance. By predicting the drug's effect, you can solidify your understanding of how ACC is switched 'on' to initiate fatty acid synthesis when building blocks are plentiful [@problem_id:2029482].", "problem": "A pharmaceutical company is investigating a new small molecule, designated \"FAS-Mod_7\", for its potential to alter cellular metabolism. Cellular studies reveal that FAS-Mod_7 is a structural analog of citrate. It is readily transported into the cytoplasm but cannot be metabolized by any known enzymes. Further experiments show that it binds to Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC), the enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step of fatty acid synthesis. Given this information, what is the most likely direct effect of administering FAS-Mod_7 to a cell?\n\nA. FAS-Mod_7 will act as a competitive inhibitor of ACC, leading to a decrease in fatty acid synthesis.\n\nB. FAS-Mod_7 will cause the covalent phosphorylation of ACC, leading to its inactivation and a decrease in fatty acid synthesis.\n\nC. FAS-Mod_7 will have no effect on ACC activity because it is not a substrate for the enzyme.\n\nD. FAS-Mod_7 will act as an allosteric activator of ACC, leading to an increase in fatty acid synthesis.\n\nE. FAS-Mod_7 will be converted to malonyl-CoA, bypassing the ACC-catalyzed step and increasing fatty acid synthesis.", "solution": "Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) catalyzes the first committed step of fatty acid synthesis, the ATP-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. The overall reaction can be written as:\n$$\n\\text{Acetyl-CoA} + \\text{HCO}_{3}^{-} + \\text{ATP} \\longrightarrow \\text{Malonyl-CoA} + \\text{ADP} + \\text{P}_{\\text{i}}.\n$$\nACC is regulated allosterically and by covalent modification. A key physiological allosteric activator is citrate, which binds to ACC at a regulatory site (not the active site), promoting polymerization and increasing catalytic activity. In contrast, covalent phosphorylation that inactivates ACC is mediated by kinases such as AMP-activated protein kinase and is not directly caused by small-molecule ligands.\n\nThe problem states that FAS-Mod_7 is a structural analog of citrate, is transported into the cytoplasm, cannot be metabolized, and binds to ACC. Given that citrate is an allosteric activator, a structural analog that binds to ACC would most likely interact at the same allosteric site and mimic citrate’s activating effect, thereby increasing ACC activity and fatty acid synthesis. It would not function as a competitive inhibitor at the catalytic site because citrate is not a substrate of ACC; the substrates are acetyl-CoA, bicarbonate, and ATP. Therefore, competitive inhibition at the active site is not the expected mechanism for a citrate analog. It would also not directly cause covalent phosphorylation of ACC, as phosphorylation requires a kinase and is not induced directly by a ligand analog. The statement that it would have no effect is inconsistent with the known role of citrate as an allosteric effector and the fact that FAS-Mod_7 binds ACC. Finally, conversion of FAS-Mod_7 to malonyl-CoA is excluded because the molecule is not metabolized by known enzymes.\n\nTherefore, the most likely direct effect is allosteric activation of ACC, increasing fatty acid synthesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2029482"}, {"introduction": "Cellular regulation is rarely a simple on/off switch; enzymes like ACC must often integrate multiple, sometimes conflicting, signals. This problem presents a scenario where ACC is exposed to both a powerful allosteric activator (citrate) and a strong inhibitory signal triggered by low energy levels (high AMP). Resolving this conflict requires understanding the hierarchy of regulation, where covalent modification often provides the definitive command, overriding other inputs to ensure the cell's most urgent metabolic needs are met [@problem_id:2029478].", "problem": "Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC) is the enzyme that catalyzes the committed, rate-limiting step in fatty acid synthesis. Its activity is tightly regulated by both allosteric mechanisms and covalent modification to reflect the metabolic state of the cell. Consider a hypothetical scenario in a liver cell where two distinct metabolic signals are present simultaneously. First, due to a sudden influx of dietary carbohydrates, the concentration of citrate in the cytosol becomes very high. Citrate is a key allosteric activator of ACC. Second, due to an unrelated cellular stress that consumes large amounts of energy, the concentration of Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP) also rises to a significantly high level. High AMP levels are known to lead to the potent inactivation of ACC via a kinase-mediated phosphorylation event.\n\nGiven these two opposing regulatory inputs—a strong allosteric activator (citrate) and a strong covalent inhibitory signal (triggered by AMP)—what is the most likely net effect on the activity of ACC and the pathway it controls?\n\nA. ACC will be fully active, driven by the strong allosteric activation by citrate, causing a maximal rate of fatty acid synthesis.\n\nB. ACC will exhibit a moderate, intermediate level of activity as the activating effect of citrate and the inactivating effect of phosphorylation partially offset each other.\n\nC. The regulatory signals are contradictory, which will cause the ACC enzyme to be degraded by the proteasome, halting fatty acid synthesis.\n\nD. ACC will be predominantly inactive due to phosphorylation, leading to the inhibition of fatty acid synthesis, despite the presence of high citrate levels.\n\nE. The high level of AMP will redirect acetyl-CoA towards ketone body synthesis, making the regulation of ACC irrelevant.", "solution": "Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) catalyzes the committed step of fatty acid synthesis and is regulated by both allosteric effectors and covalent modification. Let the catalytic capacity of ACC in the basal, dephosphorylated state be denoted by $V_{0}$. Allosteric activation by citrate increases the activity of dephosphorylated ACC by a multiplicative factor, which can be represented as $V_{\\text{deP},\\ \\text{citrate}}=\\alpha V_{0}$ with $\\alpha>1$. Phosphorylation by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is stimulated by high AMP, converts ACC to a low-activity state. Denote the activity of phosphorylated ACC in the absence of citrate as $V_{\\text{P}}=\\epsilon V_{0}$ with $0<\\epsilon\\ll 1$. Experimentally, citrate can partially relieve inhibition by promoting polymerization, but phosphorylation substantially suppresses catalytic competence and polymerization; this can be represented by $V_{\\text{P},\\ \\text{citrate}}=\\epsilon^{\\prime}V_{0}$ with $0<\\epsilon^{\\prime}\\ll \\alpha$.\n\nLet $p$ be the fraction of ACC that is phosphorylated by AMPK. High AMP strongly activates AMPK, so the steady-state $p$ approaches $1$. The net velocity in the presence of high citrate and high AMP is therefore well approximated by\n$$\nV \\approx p\\,V_{\\text{P},\\ \\text{citrate}}+(1-p)\\,V_{\\text{deP},\\ \\text{citrate}} \\approx 1\\cdot \\epsilon^{\\prime}V_{0}+0\\cdot \\alpha V_{0}=\\epsilon^{\\prime}V_{0},\n$$\nwhich remains small because $\\epsilon^{\\prime}\\ll 1$. Thus, despite the strong allosteric activation by citrate, the covalent inactivation via phosphorylation predominates, yielding a predominantly inactive ACC and therefore inhibition of fatty acid synthesis. This corresponds to option D and not to intermediate activity, because phosphorylation-driven inactivation by AMPK generally overrides allosteric activation in determining ACC activity under high-AMP conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2029478"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the principles of ACC regulation is essential, but biochemists must also be able to measure these changes experimentally.
