This first exercise focuses on the cyclical nature of the pathway, asking you to determine the number of rounds required to break down a common long-chain fatty acid. Mastering this simple calculation is the first step to understanding the entire process of fatty acid catabolism [@problem_id:2088040].", "problem": "The catabolism of fatty acids via β-oxidation is a fundamental energy-yielding process in many organisms. This metabolic pathway involves a series of recurring enzymatic reactions that sequentially shorten a fatty acid chain.

Determine the total number of complete cycles of β-oxidation required to fully catabolize this molecule into its final two-carbon acetyl-CoA units.", "solution": "In the β-oxidation of a saturated, even-chain fatty acid with $n$ carbons, each cycle cleaves off one two-carbon acetyl-CoA unit. The process is repeated until the entire chain is converted to acetyl-CoA. The final cycle cleaves a four-carbon acyl-CoA into two acetyl-CoA molecules. The total number of cycles required is given by the formula:\n$$ \\text{Cycles} = \\frac{n}{2} - 1 $$\nFor arachidic acid, $n=20$, so the number of cycles is:\n$$ \\text{Cycles} = \\frac{20}{2} - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9. $$\nTherefore, 9 complete cycles of β-oxidation are required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9}$$", "id": "2088040"}, {"introduction": "With the cyclical nature established, we can now probe the mechanism more deeply. This thought experiment uses isotopic labeling, a powerful technique in biochemistry, to track the fate of a specific carbon atom through the β-oxidation spiral. Solving this puzzle will test your conceptual understanding of how the fatty acid chain is sequentially dismantled from the carboxyl end, providing insight beyond simple arithmetic [@problem_id:2088023].", "problem": "In a metabolic tracer study, a biochemist synthesizes a special batch of palmitic acid, a 16-carbon saturated fatty acid ($C_{16}H_{32}O_2$). In this batch, the terminal methyl carbon (the ω-carbon, which is the carbon furthest from the carboxyl group) of every palmitic acid molecule is isotopically labeled with Carbon-14 ($^{14}C$). This labeled fatty acid is then provided to a suspension of isolated liver mitochondria, which completely catabolize it via the β-oxidation pathway into molecules of acetyl-Coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA).\n\nAssuming the β-oxidation pathway proceeds to completion, which of the resulting acetyl-CoA molecules will contain the $^{14}C$ label?\n\nA. The first acetyl-CoA molecule produced.\n\nB. All eight of the acetyl-CoA molecules produced.\n\nC. The fourth acetyl-CoA molecule produced.\n\nD. The eighth and final acetyl-CoA molecule produced.\n\nE. None of the acetyl-CoA molecules; the label is lost as $^{14}CO_2$ during the β-oxidation cycles.", "solution": "We define the carbon numbering of palmitic acid as $C_{1}$ at the carboxyl carbon and $C_{16}$ at the terminal $\\omega$-methyl carbon. The isotope label $^{14}\\mathrm{C}$ is placed at $C_{16}$.\n\nPrinciple of the pathway: In each cycle of $\\beta$-oxidation, the fatty acyl-CoA undergoes dehydrogenation, hydration, a second dehydrogenation, and thiolytic cleavage. The thiolysis step removes one acetyl-CoA composed of the two carbons at the carboxyl end of the current acyl chain, and shortens the remaining acyl-CoA by two carbons from the carboxyl end. Therefore, the $k$-th acetyl-CoA released consists of the pair of carbons that were originally at positions $C_{2k-1}$ and $C_{2k}$ in the starting fatty acid.\n\nApplying this mapping to palmitate ($C_{1}$ to $C_{16}$), the sequence of acetyl-CoA units produced is:\n$$(C_{1},C_{2}),\\ (C_{3},C_{4}),\\ (C_{5},C_{6}),\\ (C_{7},C_{8}),\\ (C_{9},C_{10}),\\ (C_{11},C_{12}),\\ (C_{13},C_{14}),\\ (C_{15},C_{16}).$$\nThe labeled carbon is $C_{16}$, which appears in the pair $(C_{15},C_{16})$. To find which cycle this corresponds to, set $2k=16$, giving $k=8$. Thus, the $8$-th (and final) acetyl-CoA contains the $^{14}\\mathrm{C}$ label.\n\nNo $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is produced during $\\beta$-oxidation itself; decarboxylation to $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ occurs in the tricarboxylic acid cycle after acetyl-CoA entry, so the label is not lost as $^{14}\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ during the $\\beta$-oxidation cycles.\n\nTherefore, the labeled carbon appears in the eighth and final acetyl-CoA molecule produced.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2088023"}, {"introduction": "The primary biological purpose of β-oxidation is to generate a large amount of metabolic energy in the form of ATP.
