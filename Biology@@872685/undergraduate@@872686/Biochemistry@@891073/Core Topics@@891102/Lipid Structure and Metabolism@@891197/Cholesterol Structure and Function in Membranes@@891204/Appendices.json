By comparing a pure phospholipid membrane to one containing cholesterol, you will develop a deeper understanding of how cholesterol abolishes the sharp melting transition, ensuring the membrane avoids both overly rigid and overly fluid states.", "problem": "A biochemist is investigating the physical properties of biological membranes using a technique called Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). DSC measures the difference in the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a sample and a reference. A phase transition in the sample, such as the melting of a lipid bilayer from a gel phase to a liquid-crystalline phase, appears as an endothermic peak in the resulting thermogram (a plot of excess heat capacity versus temperature). The temperature at the peak's maximum is the phase transition temperature, $T_m$, and the area under the peak corresponds to the enthalpy of the transition, $\\Delta H$.\n\nThe biochemist prepares two different samples of artificial membranes called liposomes:\n- **Sample 1:** Liposomes composed of pure dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). Pure DPPC is known to have a sharp, well-defined main phase transition at a $T_m$ of 41 °C.\n- **Sample 2:** Liposomes composed of 75 mol% DPPC and 25 mol% cholesterol.\n\nBoth samples are analyzed using DSC. Which of the following statements most accurately predicts the difference in the DSC thermogram for Sample 2 compared to the thermogram for Sample 1?\n\nA. The sharp transition peak at 41 °C will be shifted to a much higher temperature (e.g., ~60 °C) but will retain its sharpness and have a larger transition enthalpy ($\\Delta H$).\n\nB. The sharp transition peak at 41 °C will be shifted to a much lower temperature (e.g., ~20 °C) but will retain its sharpness and have a similar transition enthalpy ($\\Delta H$).\n\nC. The thermogram will be nearly identical to that of pure DPPC, as cholesterol is a minor component and does not significantly interact with the phospholipid acyl chains.\n\nD. The sharp transition peak observed at 41 °C for pure DPPC will be significantly broadened and may even disappear entirely, being replaced by a very gradual change in heat capacity over a wide temperature range with a much lower total transition enthalpy ($\\Delta H$).", "solution": "Differential scanning calorimetry reports the excess heat capacity as a function of temperature, and the enthalpy of a transition equals the area under the excess heat capacity peak. Formally,\n$$\n\\Delta H=\\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} C_{p}^{ex}(T)\\, dT,\n$$\nand the apparent transition temperature is the peak maximum, conventionally denoted $T_{m}$ for a cooperative transition.\n\nFor pure DPPC, the main chain-melting transition is highly cooperative and first-order-like, giving a narrow, high-amplitude peak at $T_{m}$ with a relatively large $\\Delta H$. High cooperativity can be described by a large cooperative unit size $n$; in such cases, the peak is sharp and tall. When cooperativity decreases (smaller $n$), the peak broadens and its amplitude decreases, spreading the enthalpy over a wider temperature interval.\n\nCholesterol strongly perturbs phospholipid phase behavior by two complementary effects: it disrupts tight acyl-chain packing in the gel phase and orders the liquid-crystalline phase (the condensing effect), thereby reducing the enthalpy and entropy differences between these phases. Consequently:\n- The difference in thermodynamic state between gel and liquid phases is diminished, which lowers the calorimetric transition enthalpy $\\Delta H$ (the integrand $C_{p}^{ex}(T)$ is reduced and spread out).\n- The transition becomes much less cooperative (effective $n$ decreases), so the sharp peak broadens substantially. At sufficiently high cholesterol mole fractions (on the order of 0.25), the main transition can be abolished altogether, replaced by a liquid-ordered state without a sharp, singular $T_{m}$. In DSC this manifests as a very gradual change in baseline heat capacity over a broad temperature range rather than a distinct peak.\n\nTherefore, relative to pure DPPC (sharp peak near 41 degrees C with large area), a DPPC membrane containing 0.25 mole fraction cholesterol will not retain a sharp peak shifted to much higher or lower temperature, nor will it appear nearly identical. Instead, it will show a markedly broadened or absent main transition with a reduced total $\\Delta H$, consistent with a continuous, distributed reorganization rather than a cooperative, first-order-like melting.\n\nAmong the options, only the statement describing a significantly broadened peak that may disappear, with a gradual $C_{p}$ change over a wide temperature range and a much lower $\\Delta H$, matches these thermodynamic and molecular-interaction principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2034550"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its general effects on bilayer fluidity, cholesterol's presence is crucial for the function of many membrane proteins. This practice challenges you to think like a protein designer and identify a functional Cholesterol Recognition Amino Acid Consensus (CRAC) motif [@problem_id:2034590]. Analyzing these hypothetical sequences will reinforce your knowledge of non-covalent interactions and how specific amino acid properties enable a protein to create a binding pocket for cholesterol's unique amphipathic structure.", "problem": "A biochemist is investigating a newly discovered integral membrane protein whose activity is modulated by cholesterol concentration in the plasma membrane. It is hypothesized that the protein contains a Cholesterol Recognition Amino Acid Consensus (CRAC) motif that facilitates direct binding. Cholesterol is an amphipathic lipid with a rigid, planar, and hydrophobic steroid ring system, a polar 3-beta-hydroxyl head group, and a short, flexible hydrophobic alkyl tail. In the membrane, the hydroxyl group is oriented towards the aqueous phase, near the ester carbonyls of the phospholipids, while the ring system and tail are embedded deep within the hydrophobic acyl chain core. A CRAC motif is a short sequence of amino acids, typically part of a transmembrane or juxtamembrane helix, that provides a specific binding pocket for cholesterol.\n\nGiven your understanding of amino acid properties and non-covalent interactions, analyze the following hypothetical peptide sequences from the protein. Which of these five sequences represents the most plausible and functionally effective CRAC motif?\n\nA. `...-V T N G Y A M S R-...`\n\nB. `...-V T N G A A M S R-...`\n\nC. `...-V T N G Y A M S G-...`\n\nD. `...-V T N G Y A M S D-...`\n\nE. `...-R T N G Y A M S V-...`", "solution": "To determine the most plausible Cholesterol Recognition Amino Acid Consensus (CRAC) motif, we must analyze the structural features of cholesterol and identify the amino acid sequence that can form the most stable and specific set of non-covalent interactions with it in a membrane environment.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key interactions required for cholesterol binding.\n1.  **Interaction with the steroid ring system:** Cholesterol's defining feature is its rigid, planar, hydrophobic steroid ring system. This large, flat surface is best accommodated by an amino acid side chain that is also large, planar, and hydrophobic. Aromatic side chains, such as those of Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W), and Phenylalanine (F), are ideal for this. They can form favorable van der Waals and pi-stacking interactions with the cholesterol rings.\n2.  **Interaction at the membrane-water interface:** Cholesterol is oriented with its single polar hydroxyl (-OH) group near the polar head group region of the phospholipid bilayer. A binding motif must be correctly positioned at this interface. Positively charged amino acids, like Arginine (R) or Lysine (K), are known to interact favorably with the negatively charged phosphate groups of phospholipids on the cytosolic side of the membrane (the \"positive-inside rule\"). This electrostatic interaction can act as an anchor, fixing the orientation of the motif at the correct depth in the membrane.\n3.  **Hydrogen bonding:** The 3-beta-hydroxyl group of cholesterol can act as a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor. Similarly, the hydroxyl group of a Tyrosine (Y) side chain can participate in hydrogen bonding, potentially with the cholesterol -OH itself or with the ester carbonyl oxygen of a nearby phospholipid, further stabilizing the complex.\n4.  **Overall hydrophobicity:** The motif is part of a transmembrane or juxtamembrane segment, so it must be compatible with the hydrophobic lipid environment. Large aliphatic residues like Valine (V), Leucine (L), or Isoleucine (I) contribute to the overall hydrophobicity and help anchor the peptide segment within the bilayer.\n\nA canonical CRAC motif structure is often represented as `-(L/V)-X(1-5)-Y-X(1-5)-(R/K)-`, where X is any amino acid. This pattern places a large hydrophobic residue N-terminal to a key aromatic residue (Y), which is in turn N-terminal to a basic residue (R/K), providing the optimal arrangement of the interaction sites.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option based on these principles:\n\n**A. `...-V T N G Y A M S R-...`**\nThis sequence contains all the necessary components in a favorable arrangement. It has a large hydrophobic Valine (V) at the N-terminal side. It possesses a central Tyrosine (Y), whose aromatic ring can interact with the cholesterol steroid nucleus. Finally, it has a positively charged Arginine (R) at the C-terminal end to serve as an electrostatic anchor at the membrane-cytosol interface. The spacing between these key residues (`V...Y...R`) is consistent with the established CRAC model. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n**B. `...-V T N G A A M S R-...`**\nThis sequence lacks a critical component: an aromatic residue. The Tyrosine (Y) has been replaced by Alanine (A). Alanine's small methyl side chain is incapable of forming the extensive van der Waals or pi-stacking interactions needed for specific, high-affinity binding to the large, planar steroid ring system. Therefore, this motif would not effectively recognize cholesterol.\n\n**C. `...-V T N G Y A M S G-...`**\nThis sequence lacks a positively charged residue at its C-terminus. The Arginine (R) has been replaced by Glycine (G). Without the positive charge to anchor the C-terminus of the motif to the negatively charged inner leaflet of the membrane, the peptide segment would not be held in a stable, specific orientation. This makes a precise interaction with cholesterol much less likely.\n\n**D. `...-V T N G Y A M S D-...`**\nThis sequence contains a negatively charged residue, Aspartate (D), at its C-terminus. Placing a negative charge at the membrane-cytosol interface is highly energetically unfavorable, as it would be repelled by the negatively charged phosphate head groups of phospholipids. This would destabilize the entire motif and prevent it from adopting the correct conformation for cholesterol binding.\n\n**E. `...-R T N G Y A M S V-...`**\nThis sequence contains the correct amino acid types (R, Y, V), but their order is inverted compared to the canonical model. Placing the bulky, positively charged Arginine (R) at the N-terminal end and the hydrophobic Valine (V) at the C-terminal end disrupts the standard architecture. This orientation is much less likely to correctly position the Tyrosine residue to interact with a cholesterol molecule that is embedded in the membrane in its usual orientation. The arrangement in option A is far more structurally sound for creating a binding pocket at the interface.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, sequence A is the only one that provides the essential combination of a large hydrophobic residue, a key aromatic residue, and a C-terminal basic residue in the correct spatial arrangement to function as an effective and specific cholesterol-binding CRAC motif.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2034590"}, {"introduction": "The principle of maintaining optimal membrane fluidity is universal, but the molecular strategies to achieve it are not.

Membrane fluidity depends on van der Waals interactions among fatty acyl chains; tighter packing decreases fluidity, while disruptions to packing increase fluidity.\n\nTwo key determinants of packing are:\n- Fatty acid chain length: Longer chains have greater surface area for van der Waals interactions, increasing packing and decreasing fluidity; shorter chains reduce interactions, increasing fluidity.\n- Degree of unsaturation: Double bonds introduce kinks, preventing tight packing and increasing fluidity; saturated chains pack more tightly and decrease fluidity.\n\nBacteria do not synthesize cholesterol, so they primarily adjust membrane fluidity by altering fatty acid chain length and the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids.\n\nWhen temperature decreases (from 25 to 5), membranes become more rigid. To maintain an optimal, functional fluidity, bacteria adapt by changes that increase fluidity: decreasing average chain length and increasing the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A: Shorter chains increase fluidity, but decreasing unsaturation decreases fluidity; mixed effects, not the optimal response.\n- B: Longer chains decrease fluidity, unsaturation increases fluidity; mixed effects, not optimal.\n- C: Longer chains and decreased unsaturation both decrease fluidity; opposite of needed.\n- D: Shorter chains and increased unsaturation both increase fluidity; this matches the required adaptation.\n- E: Incorrect, because bacteria do not rely solely on head-group modifications; they commonly modulate fatty acid saturation and chain length to adjust fluidity.\n\nTherefore, the most likely adaptive change is a decrease in average chain length and an increase in the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2034566"}]}
