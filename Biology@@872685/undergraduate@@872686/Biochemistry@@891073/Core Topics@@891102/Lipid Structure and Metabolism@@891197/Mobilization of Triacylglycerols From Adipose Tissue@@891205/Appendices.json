This mutation results in a completely non-functional enzyme. In adipocytes (fat cells), HSL is a key enzyme in the catabolic pathway that mobilizes stored fats. During a period of fasting, hormonal signals normally trigger the sequential breakdown of stored triacylglycerols into fatty acids and glycerol, which are then released into the bloodstream. Given the patient's condition, which of the following lipid molecules would be expected to accumulate to abnormally high levels inside their adipocytes during a fast?\n\nA. Triacylglycerol\n\nB. Monoacylglycerol\n\nC. Glycerol-3-phosphate\n\nD. Diacylglycerol\n\nE. Free fatty acids", "solution": "During fasting, catecholamine signaling activates protein kinase A, which stimulates lipolysis in adipocytes. The sequential hydrolysis of stored triacylglycerol (TAG) proceeds through three defined steps, each catalyzed by a specific lipase:\n1) Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) catalyzes the first step:\n$$\\text{TAG} \\xrightarrow{\\text{ATGL}} \\text{DAG} + \\text{FA}.$$\n2) Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) catalyzes the second step:\n$$\\text{DAG} \\xrightarrow{\\text{HSL}} \\text{MAG} + \\text{FA}.$$\n3) Monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) catalyzes the third step:\n$$\\text{MAG} \\xrightarrow{\\text{MGL}} \\text{Glycerol} + \\text{FA}.$$\n\nGiven a completely non-functional HSL, the conversion of diacylglycerol (DAG) to monoacylglycerol (MAG) is blocked. Upstream of this block, ATGL remains active during fasting and continues to hydrolyze TAG to DAG, thereby generating DAG. Because the downstream step is impaired, DAG will accumulate inside adipocytes.\n\nBy contrast:\n- Triacylglycerol will not accumulate abnormally because ATGL is functional and will continue to convert TAG to DAG.\n- Monoacylglycerol will not accumulate because its production from DAG is impaired and any MAG present can still be hydrolyzed by MGL.\n- Glycerol-3-phosphate is a precursor in TAG synthesis (formed from glycolysis) rather than a product of lipolysis and would not accumulate during fasting-triggered lipolysis.\n- Free fatty acids are generated at each hydrolytic step; with the HSL block, overall FA production and release are reduced rather than increased, and intracellular accumulation is not expected to exceed the buildup of the immediate substrate at the blocked step.\n\nTherefore, the lipid species that accumulates is diacylglycerol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2059055"}, {"introduction": "Metabolism is a dynamic balance between building up (anabolism) and breaking down (catabolism) molecules. Shifting our focus from fat mobilization to fat storage, this exercise explores how adipocytes synthesize the backbone for new triacylglycerols. This hypothetical experiment reveals a crucial, tissue-specific limitation in adipocyte metabolism, forcing you to consider the origin of biosynthetic precursors and why fat storage is intrinsically linked to carbohydrate metabolism in these cells [@problem_id:2059042].", "problem": "A research team is investigating the metabolic pathways of lipid storage in isolated rat adipocytes. The cells are incubated in a culture medium containing a high concentration of glucose and a physiological level of insulin. To trace the synthesis of new lipid molecules, the researchers add [U-${}^{14}$C]glycerol to the medium, where all three carbon atoms of the glycerol molecule are the radioactive isotope Carbon-14. After incubation, the adipocytes are harvested, and the stored Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are extracted and purified. The researchers then hydrolyze the TAGs to separate the fatty acids from the glycerol backbone. Upon analysis, they find that while new TAGs have been synthesized, virtually no radioactivity is detected in the glycerol component of these TAGs.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate biochemical explanation for this observation?\n\nA. Insulin strongly inhibits the transport of glycerol across the adipocyte plasma membrane, preventing its entry into the cell.\n\nB. Adipocytes primarily synthesize the glycerol backbone for TAGs from a glycolytic intermediate and lack the necessary enzyme to phosphorylate free glycerol from the medium.\n\nC. The high concentration of glucose in the medium competitively inhibits the enzyme responsible for phosphorylating glycerol, making the pathway inactive.\n\nD. Under the influence of insulin, the glycerol moiety for TAG synthesis is exclusively recycled from the breakdown of pre-existing TAGs within the adipocyte.\n\nE. The radioactive carbon atoms from glycerol are immediately oxidized to $\\text{CO}_2$ via the citric acid cycle for energy, preventing their incorporation into structural molecules like TAGs.", "solution": "Triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis in adipocytes requires a glycerol backbone in the form of glycerol-3-phosphate and acyl chains in the form of acyl-CoA. There are two principal biochemical routes to glycerol-3-phosphate:\n\n1) From glycolysis via the reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP):\n$$\n\\text{DHAP} + \\text{NADH} + H^{+} \\xrightarrow{\\text{glycerol\\text{-}3\\text{-}phosphate dehydrogenase}} \\text{glycerol\\text{-}3\\text{-}phosphate} + \\text{NAD}^{+}.\n$$\n\n2) From free glycerol via phosphorylation by glycerol kinase:\n$$\n\\text{glycerol} + \\text{ATP} \\xrightarrow{\\text{glycerol kinase}} \\text{glycerol\\text{-}3\\text{-}phosphate} + \\text{ADP}.\n$$\n\nAdipocytes characteristically lack significant glycerol kinase activity, so they are unable to convert exogenous glycerol to glycerol-3-phosphate. Consequently, in adipocytes the glycerol backbone for TAG synthesis is supplied predominantly from glycolytic flux (route 1), not from free glycerol (route 2).\n\nUnder the stated conditions (high glucose and physiological insulin), insulin increases glucose uptake via GLUT4 and stimulates glycolysis, thereby increasing intracellular DHAP and the production of glycerol-3-phosphate from glucose carbons. Therefore, newly synthesized TAGs incorporate a glycerol backbone derived from glucose (via DHAP), not from exogenous glycerol.\n\nBecause adipocytes cannot efficiently phosphorylate [U-${}^{14}$C]glycerol due to absent glycerol kinase, the labeled glycerol is not converted into glycerol-3-phosphate and thus is not incorporated into the glycerol moiety of TAG. This directly explains why hydrolyzed TAGs show virtually no radioactivity in the glycerol component.\n\nEvaluation of alternatives:\n- A is incorrect: insulin does not strongly inhibit glycerol transport; glycerol can traverse via aquaporins and passive pathways.\n- B is correct: adipocytes primarily derive the glycerol backbone from a glycolytic intermediate (DHAP) and lack glycerol kinase to phosphorylate free glycerol.\n- C is incorrect: there is no competitive inhibition of glycerol kinase by glucose; rather, adipocytes lack glycerol kinase activity.\n- D is incorrect: insulin suppresses lipolysis, and the glycerol backbone is not exclusively recycled from pre-existing TAGs; it is mainly synthesized from DHAP.\n- E is incorrect: labeled glycerol cannot be oxidized via the citric acid cycle in adipocytes without prior phosphorylation; the block is at the entry step (lack of glycerol kinase).\n\nTherefore, the most accurate biochemical explanation is that adipocytes synthesize the glycerol backbone from a glycolytic intermediate and lack the enzyme to use exogenous glycerol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2059042"}, {"introduction": "Metabolic pathways that appear opposing can sometimes run simultaneously, creating what is known as a \"futile cycle.\" This exercise moves from qualitative principles to quantitative analysis by asking you to calculate the energetic cost of such a cycle in an adipocyte.
