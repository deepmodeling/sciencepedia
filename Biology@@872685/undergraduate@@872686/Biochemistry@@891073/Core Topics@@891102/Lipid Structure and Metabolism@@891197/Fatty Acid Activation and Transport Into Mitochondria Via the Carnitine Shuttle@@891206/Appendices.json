This exercise uses a hypothetical radiolabeling experiment to probe the distinct nature of the cytosolic and mitochondrial Coenzyme A pools. By tracing the fate of a labeled sulfur atom, you will clarify what is—and what is not—transported by the carnitine shuttle, reinforcing a critical concept about its mechanism [@problem_id:2045504].", "problem": "A research team is investigating fatty acid metabolism using a novel radiolabeling technique. They prepare a culture of hepatocytes (liver cells) and introduce a custom-synthesized version of Coenzyme A (CoA) directly into the cytosol. In this modified CoA, the sulfur atom of the reactive thiol group is the radioactive isotope sulfur-35 ($^{35}$S). Following this, a long-chain fatty acid, hexadecanoic acid, is added to the cell culture medium, and the cells are incubated to allow for fatty acid uptake, activation, and transport into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation.\n\nAfter a sufficient incubation period, the mitochondria are carefully isolated, lysed, and the molecular contents of the mitochondrial matrix are analyzed. The researchers observe that while beta-oxidation is actively occurring, the acyl-CoA molecules present within the mitochondrial matrix show no detectable $^{35}$S radioactivity.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the mechanistically correct explanation for the absence of the $^{35}$S label in the mitochondrial acyl-CoA pool?\n\nA. The enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase, which activates the fatty acid, works by cleaving the C-S bond of CoA and attaching the fatty acid directly to the pantothenic acid moiety, releasing the radioactive sulfur as a free ion into the cytosol.\n\nB. The acyl group is passed from cytosolic acyl-CoA to a series of iron-sulfur clusters within the electron transport chain, which then deliver the acyl group to the mitochondrial CoA pool, a process that does not transfer the original sulfur atom.\n\nC. The enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase I catalyzes the transfer of the acyl group from the cytosolic $^{35}$S-CoA to a carnitine molecule, releasing the free $^{35}$S-CoA back into the cytosol. The resulting acyl-carnitine is transported into the mitochondrial matrix, where the acyl group is then transferred to a separate, non-radioactive mitochondrial pool of CoA.\n\nD. The inner mitochondrial membrane contains an active transport protein that symports acyl-CoA and a proton. This transporter has a high specificity that rejects any CoA molecule containing a heavier sulfur isotope like $^{35}$S, preventing its entry.\n\nE. During the formation of acyl-CoA in the cytosol, a transient acyl-AMP intermediate is formed. This intermediate is what actually crosses the mitochondrial membranes, where it reacts with a new CoA molecule from the mitochondrial pool, leaving the original $^{35}$S-CoA in the cytosol.", "solution": "We analyze the fate of the $^{35}$S label on CoA as fatty acids are activated and transported into the mitochondrial matrix for beta-oxidation.\n\n1) Activation of the fatty acid occurs on the cytosolic face of the outer mitochondrial membrane by long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (acyl-CoA ligase). The catalytic mechanism uses ATP to form an enzyme-bound acyl-adenylate intermediate and then forms a thioester with the thiol of CoA. The net reaction is:\n$$\n\\text{fatty acid} + \\text{CoA-SH} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{acyl-CoA} + \\text{AMP} + \\text{PP}_{\\text{i}}.\n$$\nMechanistically, the acyl-AMP intermediate is enzyme-bound and does not leave the active site; the C–S bond of CoA is not cleaved during activation. Therefore, option A is incorrect, and option E is incorrect because the acyl-AMP does not traverse membranes.\n\n2) Long-chain acyl-CoA does not cross the inner mitochondrial membrane. Instead, the carnitine shuttle transfers the acyl group across. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I), located on the outer mitochondrial membrane, transfers the acyl group from cytosolic acyl-CoA to carnitine, releasing free CoA in the cytosol. The reaction is:\n$$\n\\text{acyl-CoA}_{\\text{cyt}} + \\text{carnitine} \\rightarrow \\text{acyl-carnitine} + \\text{CoA-SH}_{\\text{cyt}}.\n$$\nIf the cytosolic CoA carries $^{35}$S, then the $^{35}$S remains with the cytosolic CoA released by CPT I.\n\n3) Acyl-carnitine is translocated across the inner mitochondrial membrane via the carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase. There is no transport of CoA across the inner membrane; mitochondrial and cytosolic CoA pools are distinct. Therefore, any selectivity against $^{35}$S-CoA import (option D) is irrelevant and incorrect because acyl-CoA is not imported at all.\n\n4) In the matrix, carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) transfers the acyl group from acyl-carnitine to the mitochondrial CoA pool (which is unlabeled in this setup), regenerating carnitine:\n$$\n\\text{acyl-carnitine} + \\text{CoA-SH}_{\\text{matrix}} \\rightarrow \\text{acyl-CoA}_{\\text{matrix}} + \\text{carnitine}.\n$$\nThus, the acyl-CoA formed in the matrix uses mitochondrial CoA and will not carry the $^{35}$S label that remained in the cytosolic CoA.\n\n5) The acyl group is not handed off via iron-sulfur clusters of the electron transport chain (option B is mechanistically unrelated to fatty acid transport).\n\nConclusion: The absence of $^{35}$S in mitochondrial acyl-CoA arises because CPT I transfers the acyl group to carnitine, leaving $^{35}$S-CoA in the cytosol, and CPT II then uses a separate, unlabeled mitochondrial CoA to reform acyl-CoA in the matrix.

The cellular transport of long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix for beta-oxidation is a key energetic pathway mediated by the carnitine shuttle system. In these hepatocytes, the total volume of the cytosol is 2.5 times the total volume of the mitochondrial matrix.\n\nInitially, the cells are in a basal metabolic state where the concentration of free carnitine in the cytosol is 0.40 mM and in the mitochondrial matrix is 4.0 mM. The transport of physiological acyl groups into the matrix is rate-limited by the enzyme Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1), located on the outer mitochondrial membrane. This enzyme follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to its substrate carnitine, with a Michaelis constant, $K_m$, of 0.35 mM.\n\nWhen Inhibutate is introduced to the hepatocytes, it achieves a stable cytosolic concentration of 0.20 mM. The following is known about its mechanism:\n1. Inside the cytosol, Inhibutate is activated to its CoA thioester derivative.\n2. This activated form is a substrate for CPT1, which catalyzes a reaction with cytosolic carnitine to form an \"Inhibutyl-carnitine\" adduct. This reaction proceeds until all the cytosolic Inhibutate is consumed, sequestering carnitine in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n3. The resulting Inhibutyl-carnitine is a dead-end product; it is not a substrate for the acylcarnitine/carnitine translocase on the inner mitochondrial membrane and remains trapped within the cytosol.\n\nAssume that after this sequestration event, the remaining, un-sequestered pool of free carnitine in the cell redistributes between the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix until the original concentration ratio of $([\\text{Carnitine}]_{\\text{matrix}} / [\\text{Carnitine}]_{\\text{cytosol}})$ is restored.
