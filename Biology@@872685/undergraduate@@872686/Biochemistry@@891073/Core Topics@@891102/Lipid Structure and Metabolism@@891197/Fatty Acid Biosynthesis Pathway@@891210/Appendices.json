The process begins with a \"primer\" molecule, acetyl-CoA, which provides the first two carbon atoms of the growing fatty acid chain. The chain is then extended through consecutive cycles of elongation. In each cycle, a three-carbon molecule, malonyl-CoA, donates a two-carbon unit to the growing chain, with the third carbon being released as carbon dioxide. This repetitiveprocess continues until a 16-carbon saturated fatty acid, palmitate (16:0), is formed.\n\nConsidering the complete synthesis of a single molecule of palmitate from its initial acetyl-CoA primer, determine the total number of individual malonyl-CoA molecules that are directly consumed as donors for the carbon chain elongation.", "solution": "The palmitate product contains 16 carbons, of which the initial acetyl-CoA primer contributes 2 carbons. Each malonyl-CoA contributes a net of 2 carbons to the growing chain (the third carbon of malonyl is released as carbon dioxide in each elongation step).

Then the total carbon count satisfies:\n$$\n2 + 2n = 16\n$$\nSolving gives:\n$$\n2n = 14 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n = 7\n$$\nTherefore, 7 malonyl-CoA molecules are directly consumed for chain elongation to form palmitate from an acetyl-CoA primer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7}$$", "id": "2045727"}, {"introduction": "Biochemists often use isotopic labeling as a powerful tool to trace the journey of atoms through complex reaction sequences.

The first committed step in this pathway is catalyzed by the enzyme acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) carboxylase, which converts acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA.

Crucially, the bicarbonate ($\\text{HCO}_3^−$) provided in the buffer is isotopically labeled with carbon-14 ($\\text{H}^{14}\\text{CO}_3^−$). The system is allowed to run until the 16-carbon saturated fatty acid, palmitate ($C_{16}H_{32}O_2$), is synthesized by the fatty acid synthase complex.\n\nAssuming the initial acetyl-CoA used to prime the synthesis is unlabeled, which of the following statements accurately describes the distribution of the $^{14}$C label in the resulting population of palmitate molecules?\n\nA.

All seven of the odd-numbered carbon atoms, except C-1, (C-3, C-5, C-7, etc.) will be labeled.", "solution": "The biochemical pathway of de novo fatty acid synthesis proceeds via the following key steps and carbon transfers:\n1) Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a biotin-dependent enzyme, catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA:\n$$\n\\text{Acetyl-CoA} + \\text{H}^{14}\\text{CO}_3^- + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{Malonyl-CoA}^{(\\,^{14}\\text{C at carboxyl}\\,)} + \\text{ADP} + \\text{P}_{i}.\n$$\nIn this reaction, the carbon from $\\text{H}^{14}\\text{CO}_3^-$ is incorporated as the carboxyl carbon of malonyl-CoA.

The decarboxylation releases the carboxyl carbon of malonyl-ACP as $\\text{CO}_2$.

This final practice problem challenges you to zoom out and calculate the true bioenergetic cost of synthesizing a fatty acid from a simple external precursor [@problem_id:2045688]. To find the solution, you must connect the core synthesis pathway with the costs of substrate activation and transport between the mitochondria and cytosol, providing a holistic view of cellular metabolism.", "problem": "A specialized eukaryotic cell line is being cultured in a medium where its sole carbon source is exogenous acetate. These cells are actively synthesizing fatty acids for membrane production. Your task is to calculate the total number of moles of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) required to produce one mole of palmitate (a 16-carbon saturated fatty acid).\n\nAssume that the activation of acetate to acetyl-CoA, catalyzed by acetyl-CoA synthetase, occurs exclusively within the mitochondrial matrix. The net reaction for this activation is:\nAcetate + Coenzyme A + ATP → Acetyl-CoA + Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP) + inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi)\n\nFor your calculation, consider the complete energetic cost, including substrate activation, transport of carbon units from the mitochondria to the cytosol (where fatty acid synthesis occurs), and the synthesis pathway itself. Note that the subsequent, rapid hydrolysis of PPi is energetically equivalent to the hydrolysis of an additional ATP to Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP). The redox equivalents required, such as Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH), should not be part of your ATP accounting. Provide the final answer as a single integer.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total ATP cost to synthesize one mole of palmitate (16:0) starting from exogenous acetate, with the specific condition that acetate activation occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. We must account for three major stages: (1) activation of acetate, (2) transport of the resulting carbon units to the cytosol, and (3) the ATP-dependent steps of the fatty acid synthesis pathway in the cytosol.\n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of acetyl-CoA molecules required. Palmitate is a 16-carbon fatty acid, synthesized from 2-carbon units derived from acetyl-CoA. Therefore, a total of $16 / 2 = 8$ molecules of acetyl-CoA are needed to build one molecule of palmitate.\n\n**Step 1: Energetic Cost of Acetate Activation**\nThe activation of acetate to acetyl-CoA is catalyzed by acetyl-CoA synthetase. The problem states this occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. The reaction is:\nAcetate + CoA + ATP → Acetyl-CoA + AMP + PPi\nThis reaction cleaves ATP into AMP and PPi. The problem specifies that the subsequent hydrolysis of PPi to 2 Pi is energetically equivalent to hydrolyzing a second molecule of ATP to ADP. Thus, the activation of one molecule of acetate to acetyl-CoA consumes two high-energy phosphate bonds, equivalent to 2 ATP.\nSince 8 moles of acetyl-CoA are required to synthesize one mole of palmitate, 8 moles of acetate must be activated.\nCost of activation = $8 \\text{ moles of acetate} \\times \\frac{2 \\text{ moles of ATP}}{\\text{mole of acetate}} = 16 \\text{ moles of ATP}$.\n\n**Step 2: Energetic Cost of Transport**\nThe 8 moles of acetyl-CoA are now in the mitochondrial matrix, but fatty acid synthesis occurs in the cytosol. Acetyl-CoA itself cannot cross the inner mitochondrial membrane. It must be transported via the citrate shuttle.\nIn the mitochondrion, acetyl-CoA combines with oxaloacetate to form citrate, which is then transported to the cytosol.\nIn the cytosol, the enzyme ATP-citrate lyase cleaves citrate back into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate, consuming one mole of ATP per mole of citrate cleaved. The reaction is:\nCitrate + ATP + CoA → Acetyl-CoA + Oxaloacetate + ADP + Pi\nSince 8 moles of acetyl-CoA need to be transported to the cytosol, this process must run 8 times.\nCost of transport = $8 \\text{ moles of acetyl-CoA transported} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ mole of ATP}}{\\text{mole of acetyl-CoA}} = 8 \\text{ moles of ATP}$.\n\n**Step 3: Energetic Cost of the Fatty Acid Synthesis Pathway**\nIn the cytosol, we now have 8 moles of acetyl-CoA. The pathway for palmitate synthesis involves a primer acetyl-CoA and 7 chain-extending malonyl-CoA molecules. The 7 malonyl-CoA molecules are synthesized from 7 of the acetyl-CoA molecules in a reaction catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). This is the committed and primary regulatory step of fatty acid synthesis. The reaction is:\nAcetyl-CoA + $\\text{HCO}_3^-$ + ATP → Malonyl-CoA + ADP + Pi\nThis reaction consumes one mole of ATP for each mole of acetyl-CoA that is carboxylated.\nSince 7 moles of malonyl-CoA are needed, 7 moles of ATP are consumed in this step.\nCost of carboxylation = $7 \\text{ moles of malonyl-CoA formed} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ mole of ATP}}{\\text{mole of malonyl-CoA}} = 7 \\text{ moles of ATP}$.\nThe subsequent iterative steps of the fatty acid synthase complex use NADPH as the reductant but do not directly consume ATP.\n\n**Step 4: Total ATP Calculation**\nThe total ATP cost is the sum of the costs from activation, transport, and carboxylation.\nTotal ATP = (Cost of activation) + (Cost of transport) + (Cost of carboxylation)\nTotal ATP = $16 + 8 + 7 = 31$ moles of ATP.\n\nTherefore, 31 moles of ATP are required to synthesize one mole of palmitate from exogenous acetate under the specified conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{31}$$", "id": "2045688"}]}
