Fatty acids are often described using a shorthand notation `C:D`, where `C` is the total number of carbon atoms and `D` is the number of double bonds. The positions of these double bonds are specified using either delta ($\\Delta$) or omega ($\\omega$) notation.\n\nIn delta ($\\Delta$) notation, carbons are numbered starting from the carboxyl group (C1). The notation $\\Delta^{x,y,...}$ indicates that double bonds begin at carbons `x`, `y`, etc.\n\nIn omega ($\\omega$) notation, carbons are numbered starting from the methyl group at the opposite end of the chain (the $\\omega$-carbon). The notation $\\omega$-$n$ indicates that the first double bond from the methyl end starts at the $n$-th carbon.\n\nFor most naturally occurring polyunsaturated fatty acids like DHA, the double bonds are non-conjugated, meaning they are separated by a single methylene ($-\\text{CH}_2-$) group. This results in a repeating $-\\text{CH=CH-CH}_2\\text{-CH=CH}-$ pattern.\n\nGiven that the omega notation for DHA is $22:6(\\omega\\text{-}3)$, determine its correct representation in delta ($\\Delta$) notation.\n\nA. $\\Delta^{3,6,9,12,15,18}$\n\nB. $\\Delta^{4,7,10,13,16,19}$\n\nC. $\\Delta^{5,8,11,14,17,20}$\n\nD. $\\Delta^{9,11,13,15,17,19}$\n\nE. $\\Delta^{20,17,14,11,8,5}$", "solution": "We denote the total number of carbons by $N$ and the number of double bonds by $D$. For DHA, $N=22$ and $D=6$, and the omega notation is $22\\!:\\!6\\,(\\omega\\text{-}3)$.\n\nIn $\\omega$ notation, $\\omega\\text{-}3$ means the first double bond from the methyl end starts at the $k=3$ carbon (counting from the methyl end), i.e., the double bond is between the methyl-end carbons $k$ and $k+1$. If carbons are numbered from the carboxyl end as $C_{1},C_{2},\\dots,C_{N}$, then the $k$-th carbon from the methyl end corresponds to $C_{N-k+1}$. Hence, the double bond that starts at the $k$-th methyl-end carbon is between $C_{N-k}$ and $C_{N-k+1}$, so the $\\Delta$-start position (the lower carboxyl-end index of the double bond) is\n$$\nd_{0}=N-k.\n$$\nFor DHA, this gives\n$$\nd_{0}=22-3=19.\n$$\n\nFor naturally occurring polyunsaturated fatty acids with methylene-interrupted double bonds, successive double bonds are separated by a single $-\\text{CH}_2-$ group, which shifts the start positions by $3$ carbons toward the carboxyl end.

This thought experiment explores the relationship between the geometry of fatty acid chains and their ability to pack together efficiently. By comparing saturated, unsaturated, and a hypothetical cyclopropane-containing fatty acid from a fictional organism, you will develop an intuition for how subtle changes in structure can lead to significant differences in physical behavior [@problem_id:2053187].", "problem": "In the field of exobiology, scientists are studying a newly discovered extremophilic bacterium that thrives in low-temperature, high-pressure environments. A key adaptation appears to be the composition of its cell membrane lipids. While terrestrial organisms commonly use saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, this alien bacterium synthesizes an unusual 18-carbon fatty acid, which we will call \"exocyclo-octadecanoic acid\". This molecule contains a cyclopropane ring that bridges carbons 9 and 10 of the acyl chain. All other bonds in the chain are single bonds.\n\nTo understand the physical properties of this novel fatty acid, compare its melting point ($T_{m,C}$) to that of two common terrestrial 18-carbon fatty acids:\n1.  Stearic acid ($T_{m,S}$): A saturated fatty acid (18:0).\n2.  Oleic acid ($T_{m,U}$): A monounsaturated fatty acid with a *cis* double bond between carbons 9 and 10 (18:1, *cis*-$\\Delta^9$).\n\nAssuming that the melting point is primarily determined by the efficiency of intermolecular packing of the acyl chains, which of the following options correctly ranks the melting points of these three fatty acids?\n\nA. $T_{m,S} > T_{m,U} > T_{m,C}$\n\nB. $T_{m,S} > T_{m,C} > T_{m,U}$\n\nC. $T_{m,C} > T_{m,S} > T_{m,U}$\n\nD. $T_{m,U} > T_{m,C} > T_{m,S}$\n\nE. $T_{m,C} > T_{m,U} > T_{m,S}$", "solution": "We use the physical principle that the melting point of fatty acids increases with the efficiency of intermolecular packing of their acyl chains. Tighter, more linear packing enhances van der Waals dispersion interactions, stabilizing the solid (gel) phase and raising the melting temperature. Structural features that introduce kinks, steric bulk, or reduce conformational compatibility between neighboring chains disrupt packing and lower the melting point.\n\n1) For stearic acid (18:0), all carbon–carbon bonds along the acyl chain are single bonds, allowing rotation that enables an all-trans, nearly linear conformation. This maximizes lateral contact area and intermolecular dispersion interactions. Therefore stearic acid exhibits the most efficient packing and the highest melting point, so $T_{m,S}$ is the largest among the three.\n\n2) For oleic acid (18:1, *cis*-$\\Delta^9$), the cis double bond between carbons 9 and 10 introduces a fixed bend in the chain and eliminates rotational freedom at that position. The kink disrupts alignment and reduces close packing with neighboring chains, decreasing dispersion interactions. Consequently, oleic acid has the poorest packing and the lowest melting point, so $T_{m,U}$ is the smallest among the three.\n\n3) For exocyclo-octadecanoic acid with a cyclopropane ring bridging carbons 9 and 10, the local structure is saturated in terms of bond types (no double bond), but the three-membered ring introduces ring strain and rigidity with a modest deviation from perfect linearity. Compared to a cis double bond, the cyclopropane ring generally causes a less severe kink and allows the upstream and downstream chain segments to remain more nearly colinear, improving packing relative to the cis-unsaturated chain. However, the ring still perturbs ideal linear packing and reduces conformational adaptability compared to a fully saturated chain. Therefore, its melting point is expected to be intermediate between stearic acid and oleic acid.\n\nPutting these together, the ranking of melting points is\n$$\nT_{m,S} \\;>\\; T_{m,C} \\;>\\; T_{m,U}.\n$$\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2053187"}, {"introduction": "For lipids to function and be transported within the aqueous environment of our bodies, their solubility is key, and this is governed by basic chemical principles.
