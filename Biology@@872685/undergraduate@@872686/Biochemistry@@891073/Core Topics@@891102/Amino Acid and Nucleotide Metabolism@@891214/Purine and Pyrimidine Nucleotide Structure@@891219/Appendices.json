We can determine the abbreviation by systematically analyzing the components and the naming conventions for nucleotides.\n\n1.  **Identify the Base and Sugar to form the Nucleoside:** The base is specified as cytosine, which is a pyrimidine. The sugar is specified as ribose. In biochemistry, a molecule formed by linking a nitrogenous base to a sugar is called a nucleoside. The specific nucleoside formed from cytosine and ribose is named **cytidine**. The corresponding one-letter symbol for this nucleoside in abbreviations is 'C'.\n\n2.  **Identify the Number of Phosphate Groups:** The problem states that a **single** phosphate group is attached to the 5' position of the ribose. The number of phosphates is indicated by a letter: 'M' for mono- (one), 'D' for di- (two), and 'T' for tri- (three). Since there is a single phosphate, the correct letter is 'M'.\n\n3.  **Identify the Phosphate Moiety:** The \"phosphate\" part of the name is universally abbreviated as 'P'.\n\n4.  **Construct the Three-Letter Abbreviation:** By combining the symbols for the nucleoside, the number of phosphates, and the phosphate group itself, we get the standard three-letter abbreviation.\n    -   Nucleoside: Cytidine -> C\n    -   Number of Phosphates: Mono -> M\n    -   Phosphate: Phosphate -> P\n    -   Combining these gives **CMP**. The full name is Cytidine Monophosphate.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Other Options:**\n    -   **B. dCMP:** The prefix 'd' stands for deoxy-. This abbreviation represents deoxycytidine monophosphate, which contains a deoxyribose sugar, not the ribose sugar specified in the problem.\n    -   **C. UMP:** The letter 'U' stands for uridine, the nucleoside formed from the base uracil. The problem specified the base cytosine.\n    -   **D. AMP:** The letter 'A' stands for adenosine, the nucleoside formed from the purine base adenine. The problem specified the pyrimidine base cytosine.\n    -   **E. CDP:** The letter 'D' stands for diphosphate, indicating two phosphate groups (Cytidine Diphosphate). The problem specified a single phosphate group.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only correct abbreviation for the described molecule is CMP.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2067713"}, {"introduction": "Beyond their role as building blocks for DNA and RNA, nucleotides are the primary energy currency of the cell.

Therefore, each triphosphate has $2$ high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds.
