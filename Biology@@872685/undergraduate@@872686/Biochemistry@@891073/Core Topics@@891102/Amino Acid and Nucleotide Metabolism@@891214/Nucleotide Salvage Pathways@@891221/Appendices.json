Consider the pyrimidine salvage pathway where the nucleoside uridine is converted into Uridine Triphosphate (UTP), a required substrate for RNA synthesis. This conversion occurs through a sequence of three distinct enzymatic reactions. The first reaction converts uridine into its monophosphate form. The second reaction converts the monophosphate form into the diphosphate form. The final reaction converts the diphosphate form to the triphosphate form. Each of these reactions is a phosphorylation event where one molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) serves as the phosphate group donor and is hydrolyzed to Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP).\n\nCalculate the total number of ATP molecules that are consumed to generate one molecule of UTP starting from one molecule of uridine through this specific kinase-mediated pathway.

This practice explores a critical junction point by examining the molecule 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), which is essential for both *de novo* and salvage synthesis of purines.

This molecule serves as the activated donor of the ribose-phosphate group in several biosynthetic pathways.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary metabolic consequence within the patient's cells due to this specific enzyme deficiency?\n\nA. The de novo synthesis pathway for purines will be inhibited, but the salvage pathway will be upregulated to compensate for the nucleotide deficit.\n\nB.

The salvage pathway for purines will be inhibited, but the de novo pathway will be strongly activated via feedback mechanisms to maintain nucleotide pools.", "solution": "The mutant PRPP synthetase has reduced catalytic activity, so the rate of PRPP formation from ribose 5-phosphate and ATP is decreased. The reaction catalyzed by PRPP synthetase is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{R5P} + \\mathrm{ATP} \\xrightarrow{\\mathrm{PRPP\\ synthetase}} \\mathrm{PRPP} + \\mathrm{AMP}.\n$$\nThus, intracellular $[\\mathrm{PRPP}]$ is chronically low.

This final problem delves into the sophisticated \"economics\" of purine interconversion, where the synthesis of AMP and GMP are energetically coupled in a reciprocal manner. This advanced exercise challenges you to perform meticulous metabolic accounting to determine the net yield of a coupled system under specific regulatory constraints, offering a deeper insight into the quantitative logic of cellular resource management [@problem_id:2061033].", "problem": "In a particular type of eukaryotic cell, the *de novo* synthesis pathway for purines has been completely inhibited by a drug. The cell's only source for producing purine nucleotides is a limited external supply of hypoxanthine, which is salvaged via the Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) pathway to form Inosine Monophosphate (IMP). This IMP serves as a common precursor for both Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP) and Guanosine Monophosphate (GMP).\n\nThe biochemical pathways for their synthesis from IMP are as follows:\n1.  The conversion of one molecule of IMP to one molecule of AMP requires the energy from the hydrolysis of one molecule of Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP).\n2.  The conversion of one molecule of IMP to one molecule of GMP requires the energy from the hydrolysis of one molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to AMP and pyrophosphate ($PP_i$). This reaction also produces one molecule of AMP as a byproduct.\n\nFor the cell to remain viable, it must achieve a net production of both ATP and GTP. The ATP and GTP required to fuel these conversions are drawn from the very pools of nucleotides being synthesized. Due to the regulatory network of the cell, stable production is achieved only when the ratio of the total gross amount of GMP produced to the total gross amount of AMP produced is exactly 3:5.\n\nAssuming the cell operates under this specific metabolic condition, calculate the molar ratio of the net production of GTP to the net production of ATP (GTP/ATP). Express your answer as a single closed-form analytic expression.", "solution": "The problem asks for the molar ratio of net GTP to net ATP production under a specific set of stoichiometric and regulatory constraints. Let's analyze the flow of purine molecules through the synthesis pathways starting from the common precursor, IMP.\n\nLet $x$ be the number of moles of IMP directed to the pathway for AMP synthesis.\nLet $y$ be the number of moles of IMP directed to the pathway for GMP synthesis.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the gross production of AMP and GMP.**\nThe \"gross production\" refers to the total amount of each nucleotide monophosphate synthesized before accounting for the amounts consumed to fuel the process.\n\n-   The pathway from IMP to AMP (let's call it Path A) produces $x$ moles of AMP from $x$ moles of IMP.\n-   The pathway from IMP to GMP (Path G) produces $y$ moles of GMP from $y$ moles of IMP. Crucially, this pathway also produces $y$ moles of AMP as a byproduct for every $y$ moles of GMP made.\n\nTherefore, the total gross production of each monophosphate is:\n-   Gross AMP produced = (from Path A) + (from Path G) = $x + y$ moles.\n-   Gross GMP produced = (from Path G) = $y$ moles.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the regulatory constraint.**\nThe problem states that the cell operates at a condition where the ratio of gross GMP produced to gross AMP produced is 3:5. We can express this as an equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{Gross GMP}}{\\text{Gross AMP}} = \\frac{y}{x+y} = \\frac{3}{5}\n$$\nWe can solve this equation to find a relationship between $x$ and $y$:\n$$\n5y = 3(x+y)\n$$\n$$\n5y = 3x + 3y\n$$\n$$\n2y = 3x\n$$\nThis simplifies to $y = \\frac{3}{2}x$. This relationship defines the partitioning of IMP between the two pathways under the given regulatory condition.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the costs of synthesis.**\nThe synthesis of AMP and GMP is not free; it requires the expenditure of ATP and GTP.\n\n-   The cost of producing $x$ moles of AMP via Path A is the consumption of $x$ moles of GTP.\n-   The cost of producing $y$ moles of GMP via Path G is the consumption of $y$ moles of ATP.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the net production of ATP and GTP.**\nThe \"net production\" is the amount of each nucleotide available for other cellular processes after the synthesis costs have been paid from the gross production pools. We assume that 1 mole of AMP can be phosphorylated to 1 mole of ATP, and 1 mole of GMP to 1 mole of GTP.\n\n-   **Net ATP Production**: The total pool of available AMP is the gross production, which is $(x+y)$ moles. From this pool, we must use an amount equivalent to the ATP cost of synthesis. The ATP cost is $y$ moles. Therefore, we must use $y$ moles of the available AMP to regenerate the ATP consumed.\n    $$\n    \\text{Net ATP Production (in mole equivalents of AMP)} = (\\text{Gross AMP}) - (\\text{ATP Cost}) = (x+y) - y = x\n    $$\n\n-   **Net GTP Production**: The total pool of available GMP is the gross production, which is $y$ moles. From this pool, we must use an amount equivalent to the GTP cost of synthesis. The GTP cost is $x$ moles.\n    $$\n    \\text{Net GTP Production (in mole equivalents of GMP)} = (\\text{Gross GMP}) - (\\text{GTP Cost}) = y - x\n    $$\n\nFor net production of both to occur, we must have $x > 0$ and $y-x > 0$, which implies $y > x$. Our derived relationship $y = \\frac{3}{2}x$ satisfies this condition for any $x>0$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final ratio.**\nThe problem asks for the molar ratio of net GTP production to net ATP production.\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net GTP Production}}{\\text{Net ATP Production}} = \\frac{y-x}{x}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the relationship $y = \\frac{3}{2}x$ that we found in Step 2 into this ratio expression:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}x - x}{x}\n$$\nWe can factor out $x$ from the numerator:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{x(\\frac{3}{2} - 1)}{x}\n$$\nAssuming $x > 0$ (which is necessary for any net ATP production), we can cancel $x$:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{3}{2} - 1 = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThus, the molar ratio of net GTP production to net ATP production is 1/2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "2061033"}]}
