It poses a thought experiment involving a mutant aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to highlight the division of labor between the synthetase and the ribosome, clarifying where the crucial accuracy check occurs. Understanding this concept is key to appreciating why the precision of these enzymes is so vital for cellular function.", "problem": "In the process of translation, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are crucial enzymes responsible for covalently linking, or \"charging,\" transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules with their specific, corresponding amino acids. The fidelity of this charging step is paramount for accurate protein synthesis, as the ribosome deciphers the genetic code by matching the messenger RNA (mRNA) codon with the tRNA's anticodon, without verifying the amino acid carried by the tRNA.\n\nConsider a hypothetical cell line with a mutation in the gene encoding alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS). The resulting mutant enzyme, while still able to recognize and bind to the tRNA for alanine ($tRNA^{Ala}$), has a less specific active site. Consequently, it frequently attaches the amino acid glycine (Gly) to $tRNA^{Ala}$ instead of the correct amino acid, alanine (Ala). Assume these mischarged $Gly-tRNA^{Ala}$ molecules are stable and participate in translation.\n\nIf an mRNA molecule encoding a large, multi-domain protein with numerous alanine residues is translated in these mutant cells, which of the following statements best describes the most direct and widespread consequence for the resulting polypeptide population?\n\nA. The ribosome will stall and translation will be aborted whenever an alanine codon is encountered, leading to the production of exclusively short, truncated protein fragments.\n\nB. A population of full-length protein molecules will be synthesized, but a significant fraction will have glycine residues incorporated at positions that were specified by the genetic code to be alanine.\n\nC. Cellular quality-control mechanisms will rapidly degrade all mischarged $Gly-tRNA^{Ala}$ molecules, effectively causing a functional depletion of $tRNA^{Ala}$ and halting most protein synthesis.\n\nD. The ribosome, upon detecting the incorrect pairing of an alanine codon with a tRNA carrying glycine, will pause and wait for a correctly charged $Ala-tRNA^{Ala}$ to become available.\n\nE. The genetic code within this cell line will functionally adapt, causing alanine codons on the mRNA to be recognized as ambiguous, leading to random termination of translation at these sites.", "solution": "Fundamental principle: aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases ensure translational fidelity by attaching the correct amino acid to a tRNA bearing a specific anticodon. The ribosome verifies codon-anticodon pairing but does not directly verify the identity of the amino acid attached to the tRNA. Therefore, the amino acid incorporated at a given codon is determined by the charging specificity of the corresponding aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.\n\nGiven a mutant alanyl-tRNA synthetase, denoted AlaRS, that frequently mischarges $tRNA^{Ala}$ with glycine, the resulting misacylated species $Gly-tRNA^{Ala}$ retains the alanine-recognizing anticodon. When the ribosome encounters an alanine codon on the mRNA, $Gly-tRNA^{Ala}$ can base-pair correctly via its anticodon and will be accepted into the A site because decoding depends on codon-anticodon complementarity. Since the problem states that these mischarged tRNAs are stable and participate in translation, they will deliver glycine at positions encoded for alanine without triggering rejection or stalling.\n\nConsequently, translation elongation proceeds to completion across the open reading frame, producing full-length polypeptides. However, at sites where alanine codons appear, there will be a substantial probability of incorporating glycine instead of alanine, yielding a population of proteins bearing Ala-to-Gly substitutions at multiple positions. This outcome is the most direct and widespread consequence of the specified defect.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A is incorrect because the ribosome does not stall simply due to misacylation; codon-anticodon pairing remains correct, so elongation continues.\n- Option C is incompatible with the stated assumption that mischarged $Gly-tRNA^{Ala}$ molecules are stable and participate in translation; moreover, there is no universal cellular mechanism that degrades all mischarged tRNAs rapidly enough to halt most protein synthesis under these conditions.\n- Option D is incorrect because the ribosome cannot detect the amino acid attached to the tRNA; it does not pause to await a correctly charged $Ala-tRNA^{Ala}$ if codon-anticodon pairing is correct.\n- Option E is incorrect because the genetic code does not adapt in this manner, and there is no mechanism leading to random termination at alanine codons as a direct consequence of mischarging.\n\nTherefore, the best description is that full-length proteins are produced with glycine incorporated at positions encoded for alanine, corresponding to Option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1468656"}, {"introduction": "High-fidelity aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases often use a two-step verification process to prevent errors. This problem moves beyond a qualitative understanding by asking you to quantify the contribution of the second step, the proofreading or editing function. By calculating the impact of losing this editing capability, you will gain a concrete appreciation for how these enzymes achieve their remarkable accuracy [@problem_id:1468656].", "problem": "The fidelity of protein synthesis depends critically on the accuracy of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS), enzymes that charge transfer RNAs (tRNAs) with their corresponding amino acids. The overall fidelity of an aaRS is often achieved through a two-step mechanism: an initial discrimination at the aminoacylation (synthesis) site and a subsequent proofreading step at a separate editing site.\n\nConsider the case of Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS), which must distinguish its cognate amino acid, isoleucine (Ile), from the structurally similar non-cognate amino acid, valine (Val). In a wild-type cell, the synthesis site of IleRS exhibits a discrimination factor of 100, meaning it preferentially binds isoleucine over valine by a factor of 100. After the amino acid is attached to the tRNA, any incorrectly formed $Val-tRNA^{Ile}$ is subjected to proofreading. The editing site of the wild-type IleRS has a discrimination factor of 250, meaning it is 250 times more likely to recognize and hydrolyze an incorrect $Val-tRNA^{Ile}$ than to release it intact.\n\nNow, imagine a scenario where a genetic mutation results in the complete deletion of the IleRS editing domain, rendering the proofreading step entirely non-functional. The synthesis site remains unaffected by this mutation. By what factor does the rate of valine misincorporation at isoleucine codons increase in cells expressing only this mutant IleRS compared to cells with the wild-type enzyme? Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the synthesis-site discrimination factor be denoted by $D_{s}$ and the editing-site discrimination factor by $D_{e}$.\n\nBy definition of $D_{s}$, the rate of initial formation of incorrect $Val-tRNA^{Ile}$ relative to correct $Ile-tRNA^{Ile}$ is\n$$\n\\text{incorrect-to-correct ratio after synthesis}=\\frac{1}{D_{s}}.\n$$\n\nBy definition of $D_{e}$, for an incorrect $Val-tRNA^{Ile}$ that reaches the editing site, hydrolysis is $D_{e}$ times more likely than release. Thus the escaping (released) fraction of incorrect product, relative to the case with no editing, is reduced by a factor $D_{e}$, so the surviving fraction is\n$$\nf_{\\text{survive}}=\\frac{1}{D_{e}}.\n$$\n\nTherefore:\n- With wild-type enzyme (synthesis plus editing), the fraction of incorrect product that survives to potentially be used for translation is\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{D_{s}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{D_{e}}\\right).\n$$\n- With the mutant lacking editing, the fraction of incorrect product that survives is\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{D_{s}}\\right).\n$$\n\nHence, the fold increase in valine misincorporation when editing is deleted is\n$$\n\\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{D_{s}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{1}{D_{s}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{D_{e}}\\right)}=D_{e}.\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given value $D_{e}=250$, the fold increase is $250$.

To do this, an aminoacylation assay is performed. The reaction is set up in a total volume of 100 µL, containing all necessary components for the reaction, including a saturating amount of total tRNA and ATP. The reaction is initiated by adding 5.0 µL of the purified LeuRS stock solution, which has a concentration of 0.15 mg/mL.
