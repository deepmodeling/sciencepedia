This first practice problem [@problem_id:2063984] provides a foundational exercise in quantifying this change, asking you to calculate the shift in a peptide's net charge upon phosphorylation at a specific pH.", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a pentapeptide with the amino acid sequence Asp-Arg-Ser-Gly-Lys. The peptide is dissolved in a buffer solution maintained at a constant pH of 7.0. A specific protein kinase enzyme is then introduced, which selectively catalyzes the phosphorylation of the hydroxyl group on the serine residue.\n\nFor your calculations, use the following pKa values for the ionizable groups:\n-   N-terminal alpha-amino group: 9.8\n-   C-terminal alpha-carboxyl group: 2.2\n-   Aspartic acid (Asp) side chain: 3.9\n-   Arginine (Arg) side chain: 12.5\n-   Lysine (Lys) side chain: 10.5\n\nAssume that at pH 7.0, the addition of a phosphate group to the serine residue results in the residue acquiring a net charge of -2.\n\nCalculate the change in the overall net charge of the peptide molecule after the serine residue has been phosphorylated. Provide your answer as an integer.", "solution": "At pH 7.0, the protonation state of each ionizable group is determined by comparing $pH$ to $pK_{a}$ via the Henderson–Hasselbalch principle:\n- For acidic groups (carboxyl or phosphate), if $pH > pK_{a}$, the group is deprotonated and carries a charge of $-1$ per acidic proton lost (phosphate here is given to contribute $-2$ in total).\n- For basic groups (amino, guanidinium), if $pH < pK_{a}$, the group is protonated and carries a positive charge.\n\nBefore phosphorylation at $pH=7.0$:\n- N-terminal $\\alpha$-amino group ($pK_{a}=9.8$): $+1$.\n- C-terminal $\\alpha$-carboxyl group ($pK_{a}=2.2$): $-1$.\n- Asp side chain ($pK_{a}=3.9$): $-1$.\n- Arg side chain ($pK_{a}=12.5$): $+1$.\n- Lys side chain ($pK_{a}=10.5$): $+1$.\n- Ser side chain hydroxyl: $0$.\n\nThus the initial net charge is\n$$\nq_{\\text{before}}= (+1) + (-1) + (-1) + (+1) + (+1) + 0 = +1.\n$$\n\nAfter phosphorylation, the serine residue acquires a net charge of $-2$ at $pH=7.0$ (as stated).

Molecular biologists achieve this by creating \"phosphomimetic\" mutants, where the phosphorylatable amino acid is replaced by one that chemically mimics the phosphorylated state. This exercise [@problem_id:2309450] challenges you to think like a protein designer, selecting an amino acid substitution that best imitates the electrostatic effect of phosphorylation to create a constitutively active protein.", "problem": "A hypothetical kinase-regulated transcription factor, named Cytoplasmic Retention Factor 1 (CRF1), controls the expression of genes involved in cellular stress response. In its basal state, CRF1 is inactive and retained in the cytoplasm. Upon cellular stress, a specific kinase phosphorylates a single, critical serine residue at position 152 (Ser-152) within a regulatory domain of CRF1. This phosphorylation event introduces a strong negative charge, inducing a conformational change that unmasks a Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS). The unmasked NLS allows CRF1 to be imported into the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and activates gene transcription.\n\nA research team aims to create a mutant version of CRF1 that is constitutively active, meaning it is always localized in the nucleus and active as a transcription factor, even in the absence of cellular stress and kinase activity. To achieve this, they plan to use site-directed mutagenesis to replace Ser-152 with a different amino acid.\n\nWhich of the following single amino acid substitutions at position 152 would be most likely to produce a constitutively active CRF1 protein?\n\nA. Alanine (Ala)\n\nB. Lysine (Lys)\n\nC. Aspartic acid (Asp)\n\nD. Tyrosine (Tyr)\n\nE. Tryptophan (Trp)", "solution": "The central task is to identify an amino acid substitution that mimics the functional effect of phosphorylation at a serine residue. Phosphorylation is a post-translational modification where a phosphate group ($\\text{PO}_4^{3-}$) is covalently attached to the hydroxyl group ($-\\text{OH}$) of a serine, threonine, or tyrosine residue.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the effect of phosphorylating Serine-152 on the CRF1 protein. The problem states that phosphorylation at Ser-152 activates the protein. At physiological pH (around 7.4), a phosphate group carries a significant negative charge (approximately -2). This introduction of a bulky, negatively charged moiety into the protein's structure at Ser-152 induces a conformational change. This change, in turn, unmasks the Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS), leading to nuclear import and activation of the transcription factor.\n\nThe goal is to create a \"phosphomimetic\" mutant. This means we need to replace the original serine with an amino acid whose side chain properties closely resemble those of a *phosphorylated* serine. The most critical property conferred by phosphorylation in this context is the strong negative charge, which drives the conformational change. Therefore, the ideal substitute would be an amino acid that has a negatively charged side chain at physiological pH.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on the properties of their side chains:\n\nA. **Alanine (Ala):** Alanine has a small, nonpolar methyl group ($-\\text{CH}_3$) as its side chain. Substituting serine with alanine would remove the hydroxyl group necessary for phosphorylation. This would create a protein that can *never* be phosphorylated at that site, locking it in the inactive, cytoplasmic state. This is the opposite of the desired effect.\n\nB. **Lysine (Lys):** Lysine has a long side chain ending in an amino group ($-\\text{NH}_2$). At physiological pH, this amino group is protonated to form $-\\text{NH}_3^+$, giving lysine's side chain a positive charge. Introducing a positive charge is the electrostatic opposite of introducing the negative charge of a phosphate group. This substitution would likely disrupt the protein's function or keep it inactive, not mimic activation.\n\nC. **Aspartic acid (Asp):** Aspartic acid has a side chain containing a carboxyl group ($-\\text{COOH}$). At physiological pH, this carboxyl group is deprotonated to form a carboxylate ion ($-\\text{COO}^-$), which carries a negative charge. This negative charge can electrostatically mimic the negative charge of the phosphate group. The size of the aspartic acid side chain is also reasonably similar to that of a serine residue. This makes it an excellent candidate for a phosphomimetic mutation.\n\nD. **Tyrosine (Tyr):** Tyrosine, like serine, has a hydroxyl group and can be a target for phosphorylation. However, simply replacing serine with tyrosine does not create a constitutive \"on\" state. The resulting mutant protein would still require phosphorylation (on the new tyrosine residue) by a potentially different kinase to become active. It does not mimic the *already phosphorylated* state.\n\nE. **Tryptophan (Trp):** Tryptophan has a large, bulky, aromatic side chain that is nonpolar and uncharged. While it introduces significant bulk, it lacks the essential negative charge required to mimic the electrostatic effect of the phosphate group. The absence of the negative charge means it is unlikely to induce the correct conformational change for activation.\n\nComparing the options, Aspartic acid (Asp) is the most suitable choice. Its negatively charged carboxylate side chain is the best mimic for the negatively charged phosphate group among the options provided. This substitution is most likely to induce the required conformational change, unmask the NLS, and lead to a constitutively active CRF1 protein. Glutamic acid (Glu), which is not an option here, is another common choice for phosphomimetics for the same reason (a negatively charged side chain).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2309450"}, {"introduction": "Post-translational modifications operate within a complex and crowded cellular environment. A key feature of these systems, such as ubiquitination, is their remarkable specificity, which is conferred by hundreds of unique enzymes targeting thousands of different substrates. This final practice problem [@problem_id:2331111] presents a thought experiment that explores this concept of specificity and scale, asking you to interpret seemingly contradictory observations from a gene-deletion experiment and reconcile the effect on a single protein with the state of the entire cellular proteome.", "problem": "In eukaryotic cells, the ubiquitin-proteasome system is a primary pathway for controlled protein degradation. This process involves a three-enzyme cascade: a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3). While there are only a few types of E1 enzymes and a few dozen types of E2 enzymes, there are hundreds of different E3 ligases. This diversity in E3 ligases is crucial as they are responsible for recognizing and binding to specific substrate proteins, thereby conferring specificity to the degradation process.\n\nA team of molecular biologists is studying a specific E3 ligase, which they call LIGASE-ALPHA, and its known target protein, REGULIN-X. They create a genetically modified cell line in which the gene for LIGASE-ALPHA is completely deleted. After comparing these modified cells to normal (wild-type) cells, they make two key observations:\n\n1.  The intracellular concentration of the REGULIN-X protein is significantly higher in the modified cells than in the wild-type cells.\n2.  When they measure the total amount of all ubiquitinated proteins in the cell using a quantitative biochemical assay, they find no statistically significant difference between the modified and wild-type cells.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most plausible explanation for these two observations?\n\nA. The E1 and E2 enzymes in the cell increase their activity to compensate for the absence of LIGASE-ALPHA, ubiquitinating other proteins more frequently.\nB. Another E3 ligase, through functional redundancy, takes over the role of ubiquitinating REGULIN-X in the modified cells.\nC. The population of REGULIN-X proteins, while a specific target, constitutes a very small fraction of the total pool of proteins that are ubiquitinated by the hundreds of other E3 ligases in the cell.\nD. The proteasome's degradation activity increases in the modified cells, destroying other ubiquitinated proteins more rapidly to maintain a constant level.\nE. The ubiquitination of REGULIN-X by LIGASE-ALPHA does not normally target it for degradation, but rather for a different signaling function.", "solution": "1. State the core principle of the ubiquitin-proteasome system: E1 and E2 enzymes are few in number and largely generic in function, while E3 ligases are numerous and confer substrate specificity by recognizing particular target proteins and catalyzing their ubiquitination, typically marking them for proteasomal degradation.\n2. Connect deletion of a specific E3 ligase to its substrate’s fate: If LIGASE-ALPHA specifically ubiquitinates REGULIN-X to target it for degradation, then deleting LIGASE-ALPHA would reduce or abolish ubiquitination of REGULIN-X, thereby decreasing its proteasomal degradation and causing REGULIN-X to accumulate intracellularly. This explains observation 1 directly.\n3. Evaluate the global ubiquitination measurement: Total cellular ubiquitinated protein reflects the sum of ubiquitination events across hundreds of E3 ligases and thousands of substrates. The contribution from a single substrate, REGULIN-X, is expected to be a very small fraction of the total ubiquitinated pool.\n4. Explain why total ubiquitination remains unchanged: Loss of ubiquitination events specifically on REGULIN-X due to LIGASE-ALPHA deletion would represent a minor change relative to the much larger background of ubiquitination mediated by other E3 ligases. Thus, a quantitative assay of total ubiquitinated proteins may show no statistically significant difference between modified and wild-type cells, consistent with observation 2.\n5. Exclude alternative options:\n   - A is unlikely because E1 and E2 do not determine substrate specificity and cannot selectively compensate for the absence of a specific E3 to increase ubiquitination of other targets in a coordinated manner that preserves total ubiquitin signal while allowing REGULIN-X to accumulate.\n   - B predicts maintenance of REGULIN-X degradation via redundancy; if another E3 fully took over, REGULIN-X levels would be similar to wild-type, contradicting the observed increase.\n   - D suggests increased proteasomal activity, which would decrease overall ubiquitinated proteins and would not explain increased REGULIN-X; this contradicts both observations.\n   - E contradicts observation 1: if LIGASE-ALPHA-mediated ubiquitination of REGULIN-X were non-degradative, its deletion would not be expected to cause REGULIN-X accumulation via reduced degradation.\n6. Therefore, the most plausible explanation is that REGULIN-X constitutes a very small fraction of the total ubiquitinated protein pool, so its loss of ubiquitination does not noticeably change total ubiquitinated protein levels, even though REGULIN-X accumulates due to reduced degradation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2331111"}]}
