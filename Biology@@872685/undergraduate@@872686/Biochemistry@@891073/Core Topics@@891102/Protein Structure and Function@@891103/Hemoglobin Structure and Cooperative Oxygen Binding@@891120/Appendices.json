Standard adult hemoglobin (HbA) has a $P_{50}$ value of 26.6 torr. The $P_{50}$ value is defined as the partial pressure of oxygen at which the hemoglobin is 50% saturated. Laboratory analysis reveals that HbN has a $P_{50}$ value of 19.0 torr. Assume that in the lungs, the partial pressure of oxygen ($pO_2$) is approximately 100 torr, and in metabolically active peripheral tissues, the $pO_2$ drops to 20 torr. Based on this information, which of the following statements correctly describes the properties of HbN compared to normal HbA?\n\nA. HbN has a lower affinity for oxygen and is therefore more efficient at delivering oxygen to peripheral tissues.\n\nB. HbN has a higher affinity for oxygen and is therefore more efficient at delivering oxygen to peripheral tissues.\n\nC. HbN has a lower affinity for oxygen and is therefore less efficient at delivering oxygen to peripheral tissues.\n\nD. HbN has a higher affinity for oxygen and is therefore less efficient at delivering oxygen to peripheral tissues.", "solution": "The $P_{50}$ of a hemoglobin is defined by the condition that the fractional saturation $S$ equals one-half at $pO_2=P_{50}$. A standard model for the oxygen dissociation curve is the Hill equation\n$$\nS(p)=\\frac{p^{n}}{P_{50}^{n}+p^{n}},\n$$\nwith Hill coefficient $n>1$.

In the lungs, with $p_{\\ell}\\approx 100$ torr and both $P_{50}$ values much smaller than $p_{\\ell}$, both hemoglobins are near full saturation, so $S_{N}(p_{\\ell})\\approx S_{A}(p_{\\ell})\\approx 1$. In the tissues, with $p_{t}\\approx 20$ torr, the lower $P_{50}$ of HbN implies $S_{N}(p_{t})>S_{A}(p_{t})$, because HbN holds oxygen more tightly at a given $p_{t}$.\n\nOxygen delivered per unit hemoglobin is proportional to the drop in saturation from lungs to tissues,\n$$\n\\Delta S=S(p_{\\ell})-S(p_{t}).\n$$\nSince $S(p_{\\ell})$ is already close to $1$ for both, while $S_{N}(p_{t})>S_{A}(p_{t})$, we have\n$$\n\\Delta S_{N}<\\Delta S_{A}.\n$$\nEquivalently, HbN unloads less oxygen in the tissues and therefore is less efficient at oxygen delivery, despite having higher affinity.\n\nTherefore, HbN has a higher affinity for oxygen and is less efficient at delivering oxygen to peripheral tissues, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2049646"}, {"introduction": "Hemoglobin's remarkable efficiency stems not from a fixed affinity, but from its ability to switch between a low-affinity 'tense' (T) state and a high-affinity 'relaxed' (R) state. This thought experiment probes the fundamental importance of this T-R transition by considering a scenario where hemoglobin is permanently locked in the R-state [@problem_id:2049674]. By predicting the consequences, you can gain a clearer understanding of why the ability to release oxygen is just as critical as the ability to bind it.", "problem": "Hemoglobin (Hb) is the protein responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the peripheral tissues. Its function relies on a conformational change between two states: the T-state (tense), which has a low affinity for oxygen and is predominant in the tissues, and the R-state (relaxed), which has a high affinity for oxygen and is favored in the lungs. The transition from the T-state to the R-state as oxygen molecules bind is the source of hemoglobin's cooperative, or sigmoidal, oxygen-binding curve, which is crucial for efficient oxygen transport.\n\nConsider a hypothetical genetic mutation that produces a variant of hemoglobin, which we will call Hb-M. This Hb-M molecule is structurally unable to transition out of the R-state conformation, regardless of the partial pressure of oxygen or the presence of allosteric modulators like protons or 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG).\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary physiological consequence of this mutation on oxygen transport?\n\nA. Hb-M would bind oxygen very effectively in the lungs but would fail to release a significant amount of oxygen to the peripheral tissues.\n\nB. Hb-M would exhibit an extremely low affinity for oxygen in both the lungs and the tissues, resulting in poor oxygen uptake.\n\nC. The oxygen-binding curve for Hb-M would become even more sigmoidal than normal hemoglobin, indicating enhanced cooperativity and more efficient oxygen delivery.\n\nD. Hb-M would be unable to bind oxygen at all, as the T-state is required for the initial binding event.\n\nE. The oxygen affinity of Hb-M would be exceptionally sensitive to decreases in pH (the Bohr effect), causing it to release all its oxygen prematurely.", "solution": "Normal hemoglobin toggles between a low-affinity T-state and a high-affinity R-state. Cooperative oxygen binding arises from the T-to-R conformational shift as oxygen binds; this generates a sigmoidal binding curve and allows high loading in the lungs and facilitated unloading in tissues. Allosteric modulators such as protons and 2,3-BPG stabilize the T-state, shifting the equilibrium toward T in tissues (lowers affinity) to promote oxygen release (the Bohr and 2,3-BPG effects).\n\nIn the hypothetical Hb-M that is structurally locked in the R-state:\n- Its intrinsic affinity for oxygen is high at all partial pressures of oxygen.\n- The cooperative transition cannot occur; the binding behavior would lose cooperativity (the Hill coefficient would approach $1$), producing a more hyperbolic, left-shifted curve compared to normal hemoglobin.\n- Because it cannot transition to the T-state, it will not respond effectively to protons or 2,3-BPG; thus the Bohr effect and 2,3-BPG effect are blunted, not exaggerated.\n- Physiologically, Hb-M would load oxygen efficiently in the lungs but would fail to unload sufficient oxygen in the tissues, leading to impaired tissue oxygen delivery despite high arterial oxygen saturation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A correctly states high-affinity loading in lungs with poor unloading in tissues.\n- B is incorrect because R-state has high, not low, affinity.\n- C is incorrect because loss of T-to-R transition eliminates cooperativity; the curve becomes less sigmoidal, not more.\n- D is incorrect because the R-state readily binds oxygen.\n- E is incorrect because sensitivity to pH via the Bohr effect depends on T-state stabilization; being locked in R-state would reduce, not increase, this sensitivity.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate consequence is described by A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2049674"}, {"introduction": "The elegant transition between T and R states is governed by subtle chemical changes and specific molecular interactions within the hemoglobin tetramer. This exercise delves into the structural basis of allosteric regulation, focusing on a critical salt bridge that stabilizes the T-state and contributes to the Bohr effect. By analyzing the impact of a specific mutation [@problem_id:2049629], you will connect the protein's atomic-level structure to its macroscopic physiological function.", "problem": "Hemoglobin, the protein responsible for oxygen transport in the blood, exhibits cooperative binding of oxygen. Its function is modulated by allosteric effectors, leading to a transition between a low-affinity Tense (T) state and a high-affinity Relaxed (R) state. In the T-state, a network of ionic interactions stabilizes the deoxyhemoglobin conformation. One of these critical interactions is a salt bridge between the imidazole side chain of Histidine-146 on the $\\beta$-chain ($\\beta$His146) and the carboxylate side chain of Aspartate-94 on the same $\\beta$-chain ($\\beta$Asp94). This interaction only forms when the $\\beta$His146 is protonated.\n\nThe oxygen-binding affinity of hemoglobin is also sensitive to pH, a phenomenon known as the Bohr effect. Specifically, a decrease in pH (increase in proton concentration) lowers hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen. A significant fraction of this effect is due to the pH-dependent protonation of $\\beta$His146.\n\nConsider a hypothetical genetic mutation that results in the substitution of Histidine-146 on both $\\beta$-chains with Leucine ($\\beta$His146 $\\rightarrow$ $\\beta$Leu146). Based on the principles of protein structure and function, predict the most likely consequences of this mutation on both the intrinsic oxygen affinity (as measured by $P_{50}$, the partial pressure of $O_2$ at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated) and the magnitude of the alkaline Bohr effect.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes is most plausible?\n\nA. The $P_{50}$ will decrease, and the magnitude of the Bohr effect will be reduced.\n\nB. The $P_{50}$ will increase, and the magnitude of the Bohr effect will be reduced.\n\nC.

The $P_{50}$ will be unchanged, and the magnitude of the Bohr effect will be unchanged.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the effects of a $\\beta$His146 $\\rightarrow$ $\\beta$Leu146 mutation on hemoglobin's oxygen affinity ($P_{50}$) and the Bohr effect. We must analyze the structural and chemical consequences of this amino acid substitution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structural role of $\\beta$His146 and the effect of the mutation.**\nThe problem states that in the T-state (low oxygen affinity), a salt bridge forms between a protonated $\\beta$His146 and a negatively charged $\\beta$Asp94. This salt bridge is an ionic interaction that stabilizes the T-state conformation.\nThe mutation replaces Histidine (a basic amino acid with a titratable imidazole side chain) with Leucine (an aliphatic, nonpolar, and non-titratable amino acid). Leucine cannot form an ionic bond. Therefore, the mutation to Leucine permanently ablates the salt bridge between residue 146 and residue 94 of the $\\beta$-chain.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the impact on the T-R equilibrium and $P_{50}$.**\nThe T-state and R-state exist in equilibrium: $\\text{Hb}(T) \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Hb}(R)$. The salt bridge stabilizes the T-state. By removing this key stabilizing interaction, the mutation selectively destabilizes the T-state relative to the R-state. According to Le Châtelier's principle, if the stability of the T-state is reduced, the equilibrium will shift away from the T-state and towards the R-state.\nThe R-state is the high-affinity conformation for oxygen. A shift in the equilibrium towards the R-state means that the hemoglobin population, on average, will have a higher affinity for oxygen. A higher oxygen affinity means that less oxygen (a lower partial pressure) is required to achieve 50% saturation. The parameter for 50% saturation is $P_{50}$. Therefore, a higher affinity corresponds to a lower $P_{50}$. We predict that the $P_{50}$ will decrease.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the role of $\\beta$His146 in the Bohr effect.**\nThe Bohr effect describes the observation that hemoglobin's oxygen affinity decreases as pH drops (i.e., [H$^+$] increases). The problem states that the protonation of $\\beta$His146 is a major contributor to this effect. Let's detail the mechanism:\n- In tissues with high metabolic activity, CO$_2$ is high, leading to a lower pH.\n- At this lower pH, the imidazole side chain of $\\beta$His146 (pKa $\\approx$ 6.8-7.0 in this environment) is more likely to be protonated.\n- The protonated (positively charged) $\\beta$His146 can then form the salt bridge with the negatively charged $\\beta$Asp94.\n- This salt bridge stabilizes the T-state, which has a low affinity for oxygen, thus promoting the release of O$_2$ into the tissues.\nThe overall equilibrium can be written as: $\\text{Hb-O}_2 + \\text{H}^+ \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Hb-H}^+ + \\text{O}_2$. Lowering pH shifts this to the right, favoring O$_2$ release. The ability of $\\beta$His146 to accept a proton is a key part of this mechanism.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the impact of the mutation on the Bohr effect.**\nThe mutation replaces the titratable Histidine with a non-titratable Leucine. The side chain of Leucine cannot accept a proton in the physiological pH range. Consequently, this specific site can no longer contribute to the pH-dependent stabilization of the T-state.\nSince a major molecular component responsible for sensing pH changes has been removed, the oxygen affinity of the mutant hemoglobin will become substantially less sensitive to changes in pH. The magnitude of the Bohr effect is a measure of this pH sensitivity. Therefore, the mutation will cause the magnitude of the Bohr effect to be significantly reduced.\n\n**Step 5: Consolidate the predictions and select the correct option.**\nOur analysis concludes that the $\\beta$His146 $\\rightarrow$ $\\beta$Leu146 mutation will:\n1.  Cause the $P_{50}$ to decrease (due to destabilization of the T-state).\n2.  Cause the magnitude of the Bohr effect to be reduced (due to removal of a key titratable group).\n\nThis combination of outcomes matches option A.\n- B is incorrect because $P_{50}$ would decrease, not increase.\n- C is incorrect because the Bohr effect would be reduced, not enhanced.\n- D is incorrect for both predictions.\n- E is incorrect because the mutation has significant structural and chemical consequences.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2049629"}]}
