The Born model for charging a sphere suggests a desolvation penalty for a charge $q$ approximately\n$$\\Delta G_{\\text{Born}} \\propto \\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{\\text{protein}}}-\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{\\text{water}}}\\right)\\frac{q^{2}}{2r},$$\nwhich is positive and large when moving a charged species from water (high $\\epsilon$) to the protein core (low $\\epsilon$).

This lowers $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ below its aqueous value (6.0). A moderate downward shift (for example, to about 4.8) is consistent with this general effect.\n\nZinc-bound environment: Coordination to $\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ requires donation of a lone pair from the imidazole nitrogen; this is only possible for the neutral base, not the protonated imidazolium at that nitrogen. Thus binding specifically stabilizes the deprotonated state relative to the protonated state. Additionally, a nearby positive charge $\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ would electrostatically repel a positively charged imidazolium, further destabilizing the protonated form. Both effects lower $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ more strongly than in bulk water. The shift can be substantial, plausibly to a value much lower than in the buried case (for example, around 2.7).\n\nComparing to the options:\n- The buried case must have $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}<6.0$, ruling out A and D.\n- The zinc-bound case should also have $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}<6.0$ and likely even lower than the buried case because of specific coordination and cation-cation repulsion in the protonated state, ruling out E and C.\n- Option B, with $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ values 4.8 (Buried) and 2.7 (Zinc-Bound), matches these physical arguments.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2053699"}]}
