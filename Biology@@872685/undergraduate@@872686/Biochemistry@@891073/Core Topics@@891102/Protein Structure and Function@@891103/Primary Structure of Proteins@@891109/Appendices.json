Amino acid analysis reveals its composition to be one residue each of Alanine (A), Glycine (G), Leucine (L), Phenylalanine (F), Lysine (K), and Valine (V). To determine its primary structure, two separate enzymatic digestion experiments are performed.\n\n**Experiment 1: Trypsin Digestion**\nThe hexapeptide is treated with trypsin. Trypsin is a protease that specifically cleaves peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of positively charged residues, namely Lysine (K) and Arginine (R), provided the following residue is not Proline. This digestion results in the formation of two smaller peptide fragments: a dipeptide and a tetrapeptide. The sequences of these fragments are determined to be Ala-Leu and Val-Gly-Phe-Lys.\n\n**Experiment 2: Chymotrypsin Digestion**\nA separate sample of the original hexapeptide is treated with chymotrypsin. Chymotrypsin is a protease that cleaves peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of large aromatic residues, such as Phenylalanine (F), Tryptophan (W), and Tyrosine (Y), provided the following residue is not Proline. This digestion also yields two fragments, both of which are tripeptides. Their sequences are determined to be Val-Gly-Phe and Lys-Ala-Leu.\n\nBased on these results, deduce the complete primary sequence of the original hexapeptide.

The trypsin digestion produces two peptides: a dipeptide Ala-Leu and a tetrapeptide Val-Gly-Phe-Lys. Since trypsin cleaves on the C-terminal side of Lys, the fragment that ends in Lys must be the N-terminal fragment containing the Lys at its C-terminus. Therefore, the tetrapeptide Val-Gly-Phe-Lys must be the N-terminal portion. The remaining dipeptide Ala-Leu must be the C-terminal portion that follows the cleavage site. Hence, the intact sequence consistent with trypsin cleavage is\nVal-Gly-Phe-Lys-Ala-Leu.\n\nTo confirm, we use the chymotrypsin result. Chymotrypsin cleaves on the C-terminal side of Phe. In the sequence Val-Gly-Phe-Lys-Ala-Leu, cleavage after Phe yields two tripeptides: Val-Gly-Phe and Lys-Ala-Leu, which exactly match the observed fragments. This consistency confirms that the unique primary sequence is Val-Gly-Phe-Lys-Ala-Leu.\n\nExpressed in one-letter codes from N-terminus to C-terminus, the sequence is VGFKAL.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{VGFKAL}$$", "id": "2064548"}]}
