This exercise helps you identify the key bonds that define a polypeptide's shape and distinguish between the rigid, planar peptide bond and the bonds that allow for rotational freedom [@problem_id:2084412]. Mastering this fundamental distinction is the first step toward visualizing how proteins fold into their complex three-dimensional forms.", "problem": "In a polypeptide chain, the backbone conformation is largely determined by the rotation around specific covalent bonds. These rotations are described by a set of torsion angles (dihedral angles). For a given amino acid residue, denoted as residue $i$, the key backbone torsion angles are $\\phi_i$ (phi), $\\psi_i$ (psi), and $\\omega_i$ (omega). The polypeptide backbone consists of a repeating sequence of three atoms: the amide nitrogen (N), the alpha-carbon ($C_\\alpha$), and the carbonyl carbon (C).\n\nLet's define the angles with respect to the bonds in the backbone for residue $i$:\n- The angle $\\phi_i$ describes rotation around the $N-C_\\alpha$ bond.\n- The angle $\\psi_i$ describes rotation around the $C_\\alpha-C$ bond.\n- The angle $\\omega_i$ describes rotation around the peptide bond, which is the $C-N$ bond connecting residue $i$ to residue $i+1$.\n\nConsider a tripeptide (a chain of three amino acid residues). Let's focus on the second residue in this chain (residue $i=2$). Based on the fundamental principles of protein structure, which one of the following statements correctly describes the properties of the bonds associated with the torsion angles $\\phi_2$, $\\psi_2$, and $\\omega_2$?\n\nA. The bond rotation defined by $\\omega_2$ is highly restricted due to partial double-bond character, while the bond rotation defined by $\\phi_2$ is relatively free.\n\nB. The bonds corresponding to both $\\phi_2$ and $\\psi_2$ are peptide bonds, and thus their rotation is severely limited, creating a rigid planar unit.\n\nC. The bond associated with $\\psi_2$ has significant resonance stabilization, which restricts its rotation to be almost exclusively in a *trans* configuration.\n\nD. The bonds associated with all three angles ($\\phi_2$, $\\psi_2$, and $\\omega_2$) have a high degree of rotational freedom, which is the primary reason for the flexibility of proteins.\n\nE. The bond rotation defined by $\\phi_2$ is highly restricted due to partial double-bond character, while the bond rotation for $\\omega_2$ is relatively free.", "solution": "We analyze the chemical nature of the three backbone torsion angles for residue $i=2$: $\\phi_{2}$ about the $N-C_{\\alpha}$ bond, $\\psi_{2}$ about the $C_{\\alpha}-C$ bond, and $\\omega_{2}$ about the peptide $C-N$ bond between residues 2 and 3.\n\nFundamental principle: The peptide bond ($C-N$) exhibits resonance between the canonical amide single-bond structure and a structure with a $C=N$ double bond. This resonance delocalization imparts partial double-bond character to the peptide $C-N$ bond. As a consequence, the peptide bond is planar, and rotation about it is strongly restricted. The peptide bond typically adopts the trans configuration, with cis being rare except in special contexts such as preceding proline.\n\nIn contrast, the $N-C_{\\alpha}$ and $C_{\\alpha}-C$ bonds are conventional single bonds without the amide resonance stabilization that enforces planarity. They can rotate, though not freely in all directions due to steric clashes and local interactions; their conformational space is limited to allowed regions depicted in the Ramachandran plot. Nevertheless, compared with the peptide bond, $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ rotations are relatively free.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A: States that $\\omega_{2}$ rotation is highly restricted due to partial double-bond character, while $\\phi_{2}$ rotation is relatively free. This matches the peptide bond resonance restriction and the comparative flexibility of the $N-C_{\\alpha}$ bond. Correct.\n- B: Claims both $\\phi_{2}$ and $\\psi_{2}$ are peptide bonds and severely limited. Incorrect, since only $\\omega$ corresponds to the peptide $C-N$ bond; $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are not peptide bonds.\n- C: Attributes resonance-based restriction and trans preference to the $\\psi_{2}$ bond. Incorrect; this property belongs to $\\omega$.\n- D: Claims all three have high rotational freedom. Incorrect due to the restricted $\\omega$ rotation.\n- E: Reverses the restriction, claiming $\\phi_{2}$ is highly restricted and $\\omega_{2}$ is relatively free. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, only option A correctly describes the properties of the bonds associated with $\\phi_{2}$, $\\psi_{2}$, and $\\omega_{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2084412"}, {"introduction": "The specific chemical nature of the peptide bond is not an accident of evolution; it is critical for protein function. This thought experiment challenges you to explore the consequences of altering this fundamental linkage [@problem_id:2084474]. By considering a hypothetical 'polyester' protein, you will gain a deeper appreciation for why the amide bond's unique properties, including its planarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity, are essential for forming stable secondary structures.", "problem": "In typical proteins, amino acids are linked by peptide bonds, which are amide linkages formed between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the next. A key feature of the peptide bond is its planarity, which arises from resonance that imparts partial double-bond character to the C-N bond, restricting rotation around it.\n\nConsider a hypothetical biological system that constructs polymers from amino acids using an alternative chemistry. Instead of forming an amide linkage, it forms an ester linkage by reacting the carboxyl group of one amino acid with the hydroxyl group of a modified amino acid (where the $\\alpha$-amino group, $-\\text{NH}_2$, has been replaced by a hydroxyl group, $-\\text{OH}$). This results in a \"polyester\" chain with a backbone repeating unit of $-C_\\alpha-\\text{CO-O}-$. Assume the side chains (R-groups) are identical to those of the 20 common proteinogenic amino acids.\n\nWhat is the most likely and significant consequence of replacing the amide linkages with ester linkages on the polymer's ability to form stable secondary structures like alpha-helices and beta-sheets?\n\nA. The polyester chain would be completely linear and rigid, preventing any folding into compact structures.\n\nB. The formation of stable alpha-helices and beta-sheets would be severely hindered due to the disruption of the regular, repeating backbone geometry required for optimal hydrogen bonding.\n\nC. The increased flexibility of the ester bond would allow for the formation of novel, hyper-stable secondary structures not observed in natural proteins.\n\nD. The fundamental interactions driving folding, such as the hydrophobic effect, would be eliminated, resulting in the polymer remaining as a random coil.\n\nE. The polyester would preferentially form tertiary structures stabilized exclusively by disulfide bonds, bypassing the need for secondary structures altogether.", "solution": "We identify the physicochemical features that enable protein secondary structure and then analyze how replacing the peptide (amide) linkage with an ester linkage alters those features.\n\n1) Principle: Peptide bond resonance and planarity. In proteins, the peptide bond features resonance between the amide nitrogen lone pair and the carbonyl group, giving the $C-N$ bond partial double-bond character. Consequences:\n- Restricted rotation about the $C-N$ bond, enforcing planarity of the peptide unit.\n- A regular, repeating backbone geometry that constrains the dihedral angles to specific ranges compatible with stable motifs (e.g., Ramachandran-favored regions for $\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets).\n\n2) Principle: Backbone hydrogen bonding pattern. In $\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets, stability arises from regular arrays of hydrogen bonds between backbone carbonyl oxygens (acceptors) and backbone amide $N-H$ groups (donors). Typical patterns include $i \\to i+4$ hydrogen bonds in $\\alpha$-helices and interstrand hydrogen bonds in $\\beta$-sheets.\n\n3) Modification in the hypothetical polymer: Replacement of the $\\alpha$-amino group with a hydroxyl group and formation of an ester linkage produces a backbone repeating unit $-C_\\alpha-\\text{CO-O}-$. Consequences:\n- Loss of the backbone amide $N-H$ donor: the ester linkage has a carbonyl oxygen (acceptor) but no amide $N-H$, removing the principal backbone hydrogen-bond donor necessary for the canonical helix and sheet patterns.\n- Altered resonance and rotational barriers: although esters do have resonance between the carbonyl and the alkoxy oxygen, the partial double-bond character associated with the C–O single bond is weaker than the amide $C-N$ partial double bond. This yields a lower rotational barrier about the C–O bond and less enforced planarity compared to amides, increasing backbone flexibility and disrupting the uniformity of dihedral angles required for regular secondary structure.\n\n4) Net effect on secondary structure formation:\n- The absence of regular backbone donors and the increased flexibility together disrupt the repeating hydrogen-bonding patterns and the consistent backbone geometry that stabilize $\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets.\n- Therefore, the formation of stable, native-like $\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets would be severely hindered.\n\n5) Evaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect: ester linkages would not make the chain completely rigid; they are generally more flexible than amide linkages.\n- B is correct: the disruption of backbone hydrogen bonding and regular geometry hinders stable $\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets.\n- C is incorrect: increased flexibility generally destabilizes regular secondary structure; there is no basis for hyper-stability.\n- D is incorrect: the hydrophobic effect arises from side chains in water and would still operate.\n- E is incorrect: disulfide bonds can stabilize tertiary structure but do not generally replace the role of secondary-structure hydrogen-bond networks.\n\nThus, the most likely and significant consequence is severe hindrance of stable $\\alpha$-helix and $\\beta$-sheet formation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2084474"}, {"introduction": "We often describe the peptide bond's rotation as 'restricted,' but what does that mean in quantitative terms?
