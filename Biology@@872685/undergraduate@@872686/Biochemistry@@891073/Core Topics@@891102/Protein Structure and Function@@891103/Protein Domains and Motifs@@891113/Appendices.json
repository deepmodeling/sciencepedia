{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A protein's primary amino acid sequence is a rich source of information, holding clues not just about its final folded structure but also its location and function within the cell. One of the first questions a biochemist might ask about a new protein is whether it resides in a membrane. This practice exercise [@problem_id:2066216] walks you through a foundational bioinformatics technique: using a hydropathy plot to identify potential transmembrane domains, connecting the chemical properties of amino acids to large-scale protein architecture.", "problem": "Biochemists are studying a newly discovered protein, the Halocrenarchaeal Transporter A (HtrA), isolated from an extremophile archaeon living in a high-salt environment. They hypothesize that HtrA is an Integral Membrane Protein (IMP) with multiple segments that span the cell membrane. To test this, they perform a computational analysis of its primary amino acid sequence using a hydropathy plot.\n\nThe standard procedure for identifying a potential alpha-helical transmembrane domain from this analysis involves two criteria:\n1.  **Hydrophobicity Criterion**: The segment must have a sufficiently high average hydropathy index. The threshold for consideration is an average index greater than +1.5.\n2.  **Length Criterion**: The segment must be long enough to span the lipid bilayer. It is estimated that a continuous stretch of at least 19 amino acid residues is required.\n\nThe computational analysis of the HtrA sequence yielded several contiguous regions where the running average of the hydropathy index was positive. The data for these specific regions are summarized below:\n\n-   **Region A**: A segment from residue 42 to residue 58, with an average hydropathy index of +2.3.\n-   **Region B**: A segment from residue 91 to residue 112, with an average hydropathy index of +1.9.\n-   **Region C**: A segment from residue 145 to residue 160, with an average hydropathy index of +1.4.\n-   **Region D**: A segment from residue 205 to residue 227, with an average hydropathy index of +2.5.\n-   **Region E**: A segment from residue 280 to residue 300, with an average hydropathy index of +1.1.\n-   **Region F**: A segment from residue 333 to residue 352, with an average hydropathy index of +1.7.\n\nBased on the provided criteria and data, determine the total number of alpha-helical transmembrane domains that HtrA is predicted to have.", "solution": "We apply the two criteria to each region. The hydrophobicity criterion is $\\bar{H} > 1.5$. The length criterion is $L \\ge 19$, with length computed as $L = r_{\\text{end}} - r_{\\text{start}} + 1$ for a segment from $r_{\\text{start}}$ to $r_{\\text{end}}$.\n\nRegion A: $L_{A} = 58 - 42 + 1 = 17 < 19$, $\\bar{H}_{A} = 2.3 > 1.5$.

To find these, scientists rely on curated databases that catalog thousands of known motifs. This problem [@problem_id:2066224] challenges you to select the correct bioinformatics tool and strategy for scanning a novel protein sequence against a motif database, a critical and routine step in modern protein characterization.", "problem": "A biochemist has successfully isolated and sequenced a novel protein from a species of archaea living in a high-salt environment. The full primary amino acid sequence is now available. The researcher hypothesizes that this protein may be involved in ion transport and suspects it might contain conserved functional motifs, such as an ion channel pore-forming loop or a specific cation-binding site. To investigate this, they decide to use the PROSITE database, a curated collection of protein families and domains.\n\nGiven their goal of using the PROSITE database to identify known functional motifs within their novel protein sequence, which of the following actions represents the most direct and primary step?\n\nA. Use the amino acid sequence to predict the protein's secondary structure (alpha-helices and beta-sheets) and then search for structural databases that contain similar folds.\n\nB. Input the complete primary amino acid sequence into the ScanProsite tool, which is designed to search a query sequence against the patterns and profiles in the PROSITE database.\n\nC. Reverse-translate the protein sequence into a corresponding messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence and submit this nucleotide sequence to a gene database.\n\nD. Perform a search using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) against the entire non-redundant protein database to find evolutionarily related full-length proteins.\n\nE. Calculate the protein's theoretical molecular weight and isoelectric point from its sequence to see which entries in PROSITE have similar bulk physical properties.", "solution": "The correct choice is B. The reasoning for each option is as follows:\n\nThe problem asks for the most direct and primary step to identify known functional motifs from a given amino acid sequence using the PROSITE database. PROSITE is a database specifically designed to store and identify protein domains, families, and functional sites based on conserved sequence patterns (motifs) and profiles (which are more sophisticated statistical models of motifs).\n\nOption B: Input the complete primary amino acid sequence into the ScanProsite tool. This is the correct answer. The ScanProsite tool is the primary search interface for the PROSITE database. Its explicit function is to take a user's query sequence (in this case, the novel archaeal protein) and compare it against the entire collection of motifs, patterns, and profiles contained within PROSITE. This directly addresses the researcher's goal of checking if their protein contains any of the well-characterized functional sites cataloged in the database.\n\nOption A: Predict secondary structure and search structural databases. This is an incorrect first step in this context. While structure is related to function, predicting it from sequence is a complex computational task that is separate from a sequence motif search. Furthermore, this approach uses structural databases, not the sequence-pattern based PROSITE database as specified in the problem. A PROSITE search is a much faster, simpler, and more direct initial analysis based on the primary sequence alone.\n\nOption C: Reverse-translate to mRNA and search a gene database. This is incorrect. PROSITE is a protein database and its patterns are defined by amino acid sequences. Protein sequences cannot be unambiguously reverse-translated into a single mRNA sequence due to the degeneracy of the genetic code (multiple codons can code for the same amino acid). Furthermore, submitting a nucleotide sequence to a protein motif database is fundamentally the wrong type of data.\n\nOption D: Perform a BLAST search. This is a plausible but incorrect answer for the specific question asked. BLAST is an essential tool in bioinformatics used to find homologous sequences by identifying regions of local similarity. While a researcher would almost certainly perform a BLAST search to characterize a new protein, it is not the most direct way to use the *PROSITE database itself*. A BLAST search queries a massive, general-purpose sequence repository (like NCBI's nr database) to find evolutionary relatives. A ScanProsite search queries the smaller, highly curated PROSITE database to find specific, pre-defined functional patterns. The question specifically asks about using PROSITE, making the tool designed for that purpose (ScanProsite) the most direct step.\n\nOption E: Calculate molecular weight and isoelectric point. This is incorrect. These are bulk biophysical properties of the entire protein. While they are useful for characterization (e.g., planning a purification experiment), they provide no information about the presence or location of specific, short sequence motifs within the protein. The PROSITE database is organized by sequence patterns, not by the overall physical properties of the proteins those patterns are found in. Therefore, these calculations cannot be used to effectively search the database for motifs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2066224"}, {"introduction": "Computational predictions provide powerful hypotheses, but they must be validated with laboratory experiments. When a protein contains multiple similar domains, how can we determine which one is responsible for a specific interaction? This exercise [@problem_id:2332892] puts you in the role of a molecular biologist interpreting real-world experimental data. By analyzing the results of a co-immunoprecipitation experiment using a series of deletion mutants, you will pinpoint which specific PDZ domain is essential for a key protein-protein interaction, demonstrating how function is mapped to structure.", "problem": "A molecular biologist is investigating the interaction between Post-Synaptic Density protein 95 (PSD-95) and a specific subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a key process for synaptic signaling in neurons. PSD-95 is a scaffolding protein that contains three distinct protein-protein interaction domains known as PDZ domains, labeled sequentially as PDZ1, PDZ2, and PDZ3. To determine which of these domains is essential for binding to the C-terminal tail of the NMDA receptor subunit, the researcher creates a series of deletion mutants of PSD-95.\n\nEach PSD-95 construct is fused to a reporter tag. The constructs are:\n1.  **WT**: Full-length, wild-type PSD-95 containing all three PDZ domains.\n2.  **$\\Delta$PDZ1**: A mutant lacking the PDZ1 domain.\n3.  **$\\Delta$PDZ2**: A mutant lacking the PDZ2 domain.\n4.  **$\\Delta$PDZ3**: A mutant lacking the PDZ3 domain.\n\nEach construct is expressed in cultured cells along with the NMDA receptor subunit. The researcher then performs a Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiment. In this experiment, an antibody against the reporter tag is used to pull down the PSD-95 construct and any proteins bound to it. The amount of the NMDA receptor subunit that is co-precipitated with each PSD-95 construct is then quantified. The results are normalized to the amount of NMDA receptor pulled down by the wild-type (WT) PSD-95, which is set as 100%.\n\nThe quantified results are as follows:\n\n-   **WT construct**: 100% relative binding\n-   **$\\Delta$PDZ1 construct**: 98% relative binding\n-   **$\\Delta$PDZ2 construct**: 4% relative binding\n-   **$\\Delta$PDZ3 construct**: 95% relative binding\n\nBased on this experimental data, which PDZ domain is uniquely essential for the primary interaction between PSD-95 and this NMDA receptor subunit?\n\nA. PDZ1\n\nB. PDZ2\n\nC. PDZ3\n\nD. Both PDZ1 and PDZ3 are essential\n\nE. All three PDZ domains are equally required for the interaction", "solution": "We interpret the Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) readout as a relative binding metric normalized to the wild-type construct. Let the normalized binding of the wild-type be $r_{\\mathrm{WT}}=1$. For each deletion mutant, denote the normalized binding as $r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{PDZ}k}$ for $k \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$. The experimental data, expressed as decimals relative to wild-type, are:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{WT}}=1,\\quad r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{PDZ}1}=0.98,\\quad r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{PDZ}2}=0.04,\\quad r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{PDZ}3}=0.95.\n$$\nThe principle for assigning necessity is: if a given domain is essential for the primary interaction, then deletion of that domain should reduce the binding signal to near background relative to $r_{\\mathrm{WT}}$, i.e., $r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{PDZ}k} \\approx 0 \\ll 1$. Conversely, if deletion yields $r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{PDZ}k} \\approx 1$, the domain is not required for the interaction under these conditions.\n\nApplying this criterion:\n- For $\\Delta \\mathrm{PDZ}1$, $r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{PDZ}1}=0.98 \\approx 1$, indicating PDZ1 is not required.\n- For $\\Delta \\mathrm{PDZ}3$, $r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{PDZ}3}=0.95 \\approx 1$, indicating PDZ3 is not required.\n- For $\\Delta \\mathrm{PDZ}2$, $r_{\\Delta \\mathrm{PDZ}2}=0.04 \\approx 0$, indicating PDZ2 is necessary for the interaction.\n\nBecause only deletion of PDZ2 causes a near-complete loss of co-precipitation while deletions of PDZ1 and PDZ3 do not, PDZ2 is uniquely essential for the primary interaction with this NMDA receptor subunit.
