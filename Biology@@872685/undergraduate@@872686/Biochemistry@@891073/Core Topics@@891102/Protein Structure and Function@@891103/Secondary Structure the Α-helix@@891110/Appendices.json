The structure is defined by precise parameters, and this exercise allows you to calculate one of its most characteristic features: the number of residues per helical turn. By working through this problem [@problem_id:2074844], you will solidify your understanding of the relationship between the helix's pitch (the height of one full turn) and the rise per residue (the height contributed by a single amino acid).", "problem": "A biochemist is analyzing the three-dimensional structure of a newly synthesized peptide that exclusively folds into a stable right-handed α-helix conformation. Using high-resolution structural analysis techniques, the biochemist obtains two key measurements. The first is the pitch of the helix, defined as the vertical distance along the helical axis corresponding to one complete turn, which is measured to be $5.4$ angstroms ($\\AA$). The second is the rise per residue, which is the axial distance contributed by each amino acid residue, measured to be $1.5 \\AA$.\n\nBased on these experimental values, calculate the number of amino acid residues present in a single complete turn of this α-helix.", "solution": "Define $P$ as the pitch (axial distance per full helical turn), $r$ as the rise per residue (axial distance per amino acid), and $N$ as the number of residues per turn. By the definition of pitch and rise, the total axial distance covered in one turn by $N$ residues is\n$$\nP = N r.\n$$\nSolving for $N$ gives\n$$\nN = \\frac{P}{r}.\n$$\nSubstituting the measured values $P = 5.4$ angstroms and $r = 1.5$ angstroms, the units cancel, yielding\n$$\nN = \\frac{5.4}{1.5} = 3.6.\n$$\nThus, there are $3.6$ amino acid residues per complete turn of the $\\alpha$-helix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.6}$$", "id": "2074844"}, {"introduction": "While geometry describes the shape of the α-helix, its stability arises from a regular network of internal hydrogen bonds. This repeating pattern is a defining feature of the structure, connecting different parts of the polypeptide backbone. This practice [@problem_id:2337897] focuses on the crucial $i$ to $i+4$ hydrogen bonding rule, helping you visualize how the carbonyl oxygen of one residue interacts with the amide hydrogen of another residue four positions down the chain.", "problem": "A biochemist is analyzing a segment of a newly synthesized polypeptide chain that is known to fold into a stable, right-handed alpha-helix. A key stabilizing feature of the alpha-helix is the regular pattern of hydrogen bonds that form between backbone atoms. The standard rule for this secondary structure is that the carbonyl group (C=O) of an amino acid residue, denoted as residue `i`, forms a hydrogen bond with the amino group (N-H) of the amino acid residue at position `i+4` along the chain.\n\nGiven this structural rule, if the carbonyl group of the 20th amino acid residue in the sequence is participating in a standard alpha-helical hydrogen bond, determine the residue number of the amino acid that provides the corresponding amino group for this bond.", "solution": "In a right-handed alpha-helix, the stabilizing hydrogen bond pattern is such that the carbonyl group of residue $i$ hydrogen bonds to the amide (N-H) of residue $i+4$. Symbolically, the mapping from the residue providing the carbonyl group to the residue providing the amide group is given by\n$$\ni \\mapsto i+4.\n$$\nGiven $i=20$ for the carbonyl group, the corresponding amide group is at\n$$\n20+4=24.\n$$\nTherefore, the residue providing the amino group is residue $24$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{24}$$", "id": "2337897"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the essential backbone hydrogen bonds, the stability of an α-helix can be further enhanced by interactions between amino acid side chains. The helical structure conveniently positions the side chains of residues at positions $i$ and $i+4$ close to each other.

A key structural element of this enzyme is an α-helix that tends to partially unfold at higher temperatures. The engineer plans to introduce a stabilizing interaction within this helix. A standard α-helix has approximately 3.6 residues per turn, which brings the side chain of a residue at position $i$ in the polypeptide chain spatially close to the side chain of the residue at position $i+4$. To create a strong, stabilizing electrostatic interaction known as a salt bridge, which pair of amino acids should the engineer substitute at positions $i$ and $i+4$, respectively, assuming a physiological pH where the interaction will form?\n\nA.

A salt bridge is an electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged side chains.\n\nAt physiological $pH$, the relevant side-chain ionization states are:\n- Aspartate (Asp, D) and Glutamate (Glu, E) have $pK_{a}$ values well below physiological $pH$ and are deprotonated, carrying a net charge of $-1$.\n- Lysine (Lys, K) and Arginine (Arg, R) have $pK_{a}$ values well above physiological $pH$ and are protonated, carrying a net charge of $+1$.\n- Serine (Ser, S) is uncharged and polar; it can form hydrogen bonds but not a salt bridge.\n- Leucine (Leu, L) and Isoleucine (Ile, I) are hydrophobic and uncharged; they do not participate in salt bridges.\n\nA strong salt bridge requires one negatively charged residue (Asp or Glu) paired with one positively charged residue (Lys or Arg) at the $i$ and $i+4$ positions.
