The amino acid sequence of Peptide X is Aspartyl-Histidyl-Methionine (Asp-His-Met), and the sequence of Peptide Y is Arginyl-Prolyl-Leucine (Arg-Pro-Leu).\n\nThe biochemist performs a gel electrophoresis experiment. A mixture of the two peptides is loaded into a single well located at the center of an agarose gel. The gel is saturated with a buffer solution maintained at a constant pH of 8.0. An electric field is then applied across the gel, with the positive electrode (anode) at one end and the negative electrode (cathode) at the other.\n\nTo predict the outcome, you are given the following typical pKa values for the ionizable groups in peptides:\n- Terminal $\\alpha$-amino group: pKa = 9.6\n- Terminal $\\alpha$-carboxyl group: pKa = 2.4\n- Aspartic Acid (Asp) R-group: pKa = 3.9\n- Histidine (His) R-group: pKa = 6.0\n- Arginine (Arg) R-group: pKa = 12.5\n\nThe R-groups of Methionine (Met), Proline (Pro), and Leucine (Leu) are non-ionizable and can be considered to have no charge.\n\nBased on the net electrical charge of each peptide at pH 8.0, which of the following statements most accurately describes their migration behavior in the electric field?\n\nA.

Positively charged molecules (cations) migrate toward the negative electrode (cathode), while negatively charged molecules (anions) migrate toward the positive electrode (anode). Molecules with a net charge of zero do not migrate.\n\nThe charge of each ionizable group is determined by comparing the environmental pH to the group's pKa. The general rule, derived from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, is:\n- If pH > pKa, the group will be predominantly in its deprotonated (basic) form.\n- If pH < pKa, the group will be predominantly in its protonated (acidic) form.\n\nWe need to calculate the net charge for each tripeptide at pH 8.0 by summing the charges of all its ionizable groups.

The fundamental chromatographic principle is that compounds with greater hydrophobicity exhibit stronger interactions with the nonpolar stationary phase, leading to longer retention times.

The retention factor, defined by $k=\\frac{t_{R}-t_{0}}{t_{0}}$, increases with hydrophobic interaction strength.\n\nEvaluate the relative hydrophobicity of each tripeptide based on side-chain properties:\n- Ser-Thr-Asn: All three side chains are polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (hydroxyls in Ser and Thr; amide in Asn). This tripeptide is highly hydrophilic and will preferentially remain in the polar mobile phase, leading to the shortest retention time.\n- Trp-Ala-Gly: Tryptophan has a large hydrophobic indole ring (despite an indole NH), alanine is mildly hydrophobic, and glycine is essentially neutral with minimal hydrophobic contribution. Overall, this tripeptide is moderately hydrophobic.\n- Ile-Val-Leu: All three residues are branched aliphatic and strongly hydrophobic, giving the highest overall hydrophobicity and strongest interaction with the nonpolar stationary phase, thus the longest retention time.\n\nTherefore, the elution order from first to last is: Ser-Thr-Asn, then Trp-Ala-Gly, then Ile-Val-Leu, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2035115"}, {"introduction": "The classification of amino acids extends to the subtle but significant details of their three-dimensional shape. This problem explores the structural consequences of isomerism, comparing leucine and isoleucine.

[@problem_id:2035089]", "problem": "Leucine and Isoleucine are amino acids that are structural isomers of each other, both having the chemical formula $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{13}\\text{NO}_2$. Both are classified as nonpolar, aliphatic amino acids and are frequently found buried within the hydrophobic core of globular proteins. Their structural difference lies in the arrangement of atoms in their R-groups (side chains). The side chain of Leucine is an isobutyl group, $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)_2$.

Leucine's side chain is larger and occupies more volume than Isoleucine's, making it more difficult to pack efficiently in a crowded protein core.\nB. Isoleucine has a branch at its beta-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the alpha-carbon), which introduces significant steric hindrance near the polypeptide backbone and restricts its side-chain conformational freedom more than Leucine's gamma-carbon branch does.\nC. Leucine is significantly more hydrophobic than Isoleucine, causing it to be preferentially buried deeper in the protein core while Isoleucine is found closer to the surface.\nD. As structural isomers, Leucine and Isoleucine are sterically equivalent and can substitute for one another in a protein core with no impact on the protein's overall three-dimensional structure or stability.\nE. Leucine has a branch at its beta-carbon, making it less flexible, whereas Isoleucine’s branch is further down the side chain at the gamma-carbon, allowing for a greater variety of packing arrangements.", "solution": "We interpret the structural descriptions of the side chains relative to the alpha-carbon. Leucine’s side chain is isobutyl, written as $-\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_{3})_{2}$. This means the branching occurs at the gamma-carbon (the third carbon from the alpha-carbon): the beta-carbon is a $\\text{CH}_{2}$, then the gamma-carbon is a $\\text{CH}$ bearing two $\\text{CH}_{3}$ groups. Isoleucine’s side chain is sec-butyl, written as $-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_{3})\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{3}$. This places the branch at the beta-carbon (the second carbon from the alpha-carbon): the beta-carbon is a $\\text{CH}$ bearing a $\\text{CH}_{3}$ substituent.\n\nFrom steric principles in protein structure:\n- Beta-branching places extra bulk closer to the polypeptide backbone, increasing steric hindrance near the backbone and restricting both backbone and side-chain torsional freedom. This is well established for beta-branched residues (Val, Ile, Thr), which tend to have fewer accessible rotamers and can disfavor certain backbone conformations such as those in alpha helices.\n- Gamma-branching, as in Leucine, places the branching further from the backbone, reducing immediate steric interference with the backbone and generally allowing greater side-chain conformational freedom compared to beta-branched residues.\n\nEvaluate each choice:\n- A: Incorrect. Leucine and Isoleucine are structural isomers with similar volumes; Leucine’s side chain is not significantly larger, and packing efficiency depends more on branching position than bulk volume differences.\n- B: Correct. Isoleucine’s beta-branch introduces steric hindrance near the backbone, restricting side-chain conformations more than Leucine’s gamma-branch.\n- C: Incorrect. They are both highly hydrophobic, and differences in hydrophobicity are not large enough to claim a strong preference for Leucine being “significantly more hydrophobic” or buried deeper; packing differences are better explained by branching position and sterics.\n- D: Incorrect. Despite being isomers, their different branching positions lead to distinct rotamer preferences and packing behaviors, which can affect structure and stability.\n- E: Incorrect. It reverses the branching positions; Leucine is gamma-branched, not beta-branched, and Isoleucine is beta-branched.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that Isoleucine’s beta-branch increases steric hindrance near the backbone and restricts its conformational freedom relative to Leucine’s gamma-branching.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2035089"}]}
