Consider two distinct classes of simple sugars in their open-chain (acyclic) forms.\n\nThe first is a generic **aldotetrose**, a monosaccharide containing four carbon atoms. Its structure consists of an aldehyde group (-CHO) at one end (C1), a primary alcohol group (-CH2OH) at the other end (C4), and two secondary alcohol groups in between.\n\nThe second is a generic **ketopentose**, a monosaccharide containing five carbon atoms. Its structure consists of a ketone group (C=O) at the second carbon position (C2), with primary alcohol groups (-CH2OH) at both ends of the chain (C1 and C5).\n\nAssuming that no meso compounds are formed, what is the sum of the maximum number of possible stereoisomers for an aldotetrose and the maximum number of possible stereoisomers for a ketopentose?", "solution": "The maximum number of stereoisomers for a molecule with $n$ stereogenic centers, assuming no meso forms, is given by\n$$\n2^{n}.\n$$\nFor an aldotetrose in the open-chain form, the carbon skeleton is $\\,\\mathrm{CHO-CHOH-CHOH-CH_{2}OH}\\,$. The aldehyde carbon (C1) is not stereogenic, and the terminal carbon (C4) is a primary alcohol (achiral). The two interior carbons (C2 and C3) are stereogenic.

Thus,\n$$\nn_{\\text{ketopentose}}=2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{isomers}=2^{2}=4.\n$$\nNo meso forms reduce these counts, because the aldotetrose has nonidentical terminal groups (aldehyde vs. primary alcohol), and the ketopentose’s two chiral centers are not embedded in a symmetry that would render the molecule achiral in any configuration due to the presence of the C2 carbonyl breaking internal symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the requested sum is\n$$\n4+4=8.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "2077532"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply counting stereoisomers, it is crucial to understand and visualize their relationships, particularly that between enantiomers—non-superimposable mirror images. This practice [@problem_id:2077540] focuses on the D/L naming convention and the use of Fischer projections, which are the traditional tools for representing carbohydrates. By starting with the known structure of D-fructose, you will deduce the structure of its enantiomer, L-fructose, reinforcing the \"mirror image\" principle at every chiral center.", "problem": "In biochemistry, the D/L naming convention is used to describe the stereochemistry of monosaccharides. A sugar is designated as 'D' or 'L' based on the spatial arrangement of the hydroxyl group on the chiral carbon atom that is farthest from the primary carbonyl group. Two molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are known as enantiomers.\n\nD-fructose is a naturally occurring ketohexose. In its open-chain representation using a Fischer projection, the carbon backbone is drawn vertically with the carbon atom designated C1 positioned at the top. The ketone carbonyl group ($C=O$) is located at the C2 position. The stereochemical configuration of the hydroxyl (-OH) groups on the three chiral centers (C3, C4, and C5) of D-fructose is described as follows:\n- On carbon C3, the -OH group is on the left.\n- On carbon C4, the -OH group is on the right.\n- On carbon C5, the -OH group is on the right.\n\nGiven this structural information for D-fructose, determine the correct configuration for its enantiomer, L-fructose.

In this molecule, one of the α-hydrogens has been substituted with a deuterium atom (D, or ²H) and the other with a tritium atom (T, or ³H). The molecule is oriented in space such that the bond from the α-carbon to the deuterium atom is pointing directly away from an observer. In this orientation, the observer sees the carboxyl group (–COOH) at the top, the amino group (–NH₂) on the right, and the tritium atom (T) on the left.\n\nBased on the standard rules for assigning stereochemical configuration, what is the absolute configuration of the α-carbon in this molecule?\n\nA.
