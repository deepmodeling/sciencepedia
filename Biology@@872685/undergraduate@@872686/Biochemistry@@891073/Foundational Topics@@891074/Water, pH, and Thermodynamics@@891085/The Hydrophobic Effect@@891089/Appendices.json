A primary driving force in this folding process is the hydrophobic effect, which guides the polypeptide chain to bury its nonpolar residues away from water. This first exercise [@problem_id:2143756] provides foundational practice in applying this principle, asking you to predict the relative likelihood of finding different amino acids within a protein's hydrophobic core versus its aqueous surface.", "problem": "The three-dimensional structure of a globular protein in an aqueous solution is largely dictated by the hydrophobic effect, which is the tendency of nonpolar substances to aggregate in water. This effect is a primary driving force in protein folding, causing the polypeptide chain to fold in a way that buries nonpolar amino acid side chains in the interior, forming a hydrophobic core, while exposing polar and charged side chains to the aqueous solvent on the protein's surface.\n\nConsider the following three amino acids, defined by their side chains:\n- **Phenylalanine:** Its side chain is a nonpolar benzyl group, which consists of a phenyl ring attached to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n- **Glycine:** Its side chain is a single hydrogen atom. It is the smallest of all amino acids.\n- **Glutamic Acid:** Its side chain contains a carboxylic acid group (-CH₂-CH₂-COOH). In the typical cellular environment (physiological pH), this group is deprotonated and carries a negative charge.\n\nBased on the principles of protein folding driven by the hydrophobic effect, determine the correct ranking of these three amino acids from most likely to be found in the hydrophobic core of a protein to least likely.\n\nA.

Glycine  Glutamic Acid  Phenylalanine", "solution": "The governing principle is the hydrophobic effect in aqueous solution: nonpolar side chains tend to be buried in the protein interior to minimize the ordering of surrounding water and reduce the free energy of the system, while polar and especially charged side chains prefer exposure to solvent due to favorable electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions and the high desolvation penalty for burying charge.\n\nApply this to each residue:\n- Phenylalanine has a bulky, nonpolar aromatic side chain. It is strongly hydrophobic and is therefore most likely to be buried in the hydrophobic core.\n- Glycine has a side chain that is only a hydrogen atom. It is neither strongly hydrophobic nor strongly polar; it is often found on the surface or in tight turns due to its high conformational flexibility, and it lacks the hydrophobic surface area that drives burial. It is less likely than a strongly hydrophobic residue to be in the core.\n- Glutamic acid is deprotonated at physiological pH, carrying a negative charge. Charged side chains are strongly disfavored in the hydrophobic core due to desolvation costs and prefer solvent exposure.\n\nTherefore, the ranking from most likely to be in the hydrophobic core to least likely is: Phenylalanine  Glycine  Glutamic Acid, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2143756"}, {"introduction": "To truly grasp the hydrophobic effect, we must look beyond the simple 'oil and water' analogy and consider its physical basis. The energetic penalty of solvating a nonpolar molecule in water is directly related to how much ordered water is required to surround it, which in turn depends on the molecule's surface area.

A simplified quantitative model relates the Gibbs free energy required to transfer a nonpolar molecule from a nonpolar medium to water, $\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}}$, to its Solvent-Accessible Surface Area (SASA). This relationship is given by the equation:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}} = \\gamma \\times \\text{SASA} $$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is an empirical constant representing the free energy cost per unit of exposed nonpolar surface area.\n\nConsider two structural isomers of pentane, which have the chemical formula C₅H₁₂: linear n-pentane and the highly compact, nearly spherical neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane). An experimental setup uses a value of $\\gamma = 0.115 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1} \\text{Å}^{-2}$.

In the wild-type version of this protein, a leucine (Leu) residue is located in the protein's hydrophobic core, completely shielded from the surrounding aqueous solution. A mutation is introduced that replaces this leucine with a serine (Ser) residue at the same position. To estimate the impact of this mutation on the protein's stability, we can use a simplified model based on the free energy of transferring amino acid side chains from a nonpolar environment (approximating the protein core) to water.\n\nThe experimentally determined Gibbs free energy of transfer ($\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}}$) for moving the relevant side chains from a nonpolar solvent to water are:\n- For the leucine side chain: $\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}}(\\text{Leu}) = +10.12 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n- For the serine side chain: $\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}}(\\text{Ser}) = -4.31 \\text{ kJ/mol}$\n\nAssuming that the mutation does not significantly alter the overall protein structure and that the primary energetic consequence arises from the different interactions of the side chain with its environment upon unfolding, calculate the change in the Gibbs free energy of unfolding ($\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\text{unfolding}}$).
