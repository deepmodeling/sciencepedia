By examining the structural changes between the six-membered and five-membered rings, you will practice the essential skill of developing chemical intuition to infer the thermodynamic signatures behind biochemical transformations [@problem_id:2043267].", "problem": "In the second step of glycolysis, the enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase catalyzes the reversible isomerization of Glucose-6-Phosphate (G6P) to Fructose-6-Phosphate (F6P). G6P is an aldohexose, existing predominantly as a six-membered pyranose ring. F6P is a ketohexose, existing predominantly as a five-membered furanose ring. This reaction operates near equilibrium within the cell. Under standard transformed biochemical conditions (temperature $T = 298$ K, pH 7.0, and 1 M initial concentrations of reactants and products), the standard transformed Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}$, for the reaction G6P $\\rightleftharpoons$ F6P is a small positive value, approximately $+1.7 \\text{ kJ/mol}$.\n\nBased on an understanding of the chemical structures and the provided thermodynamic data, which of the following statements best describes the standard transformed enthalpy change ($\\Delta H^{\\circ \\prime}$) and the entropic contribution ($T\\Delta S^{\\circ \\prime}$) for this reaction?\n\nA. $\\Delta H^{\\circ \\prime} > 0$ and $T\\Delta S^{\\circ \\prime} > 0$, with their values being of similar magnitude.\n\nB. $\\Delta H^{\\circ \\prime}  0$ and $T\\Delta S^{\\circ \\prime}  0$, with their values being of similar magnitude.\n\nC.

This reaction is an intramolecular isomerization: an aldose phosphate (G6P), predominantly a pyranose (six-membered) ring, interconverts to a ketose phosphate (F6P), predominantly a furanose (five-membered) ring. The bonding pattern and molecular formula remain the same; no new covalent bonds to other molecules are formed or broken in net, so the enthalpy change is expected to be small in magnitude. However, five-membered rings generally exhibit greater ring strain than six-membered chairs, and the redistribution of the carbonyl from C1 to C2 in going from aldose to ketose can modestly increase the enthalpic cost in the product state relative to the reactant. These considerations support\n$$\n\\Delta H^{\\circ \\prime}0\\quad\\text{(small, positive)}.\n$$\nFor entropy, the number of molecules is unchanged, so translational entropy does not change significantly. However, the conformational landscape typically differs: five-membered furanose rings have numerous accessible puckered conformations (envelope and twist forms), often greater than the relatively more constrained chair conformations of pyranoses, and the aldose–ketose isomerization proceeds through small populations of open-chain forms that do not drastically reduce overall microstate counts. These features are consistent with a slight increase in configurational entropy upon forming F6P, giving\n$$\n\\Delta S^{\\circ \\prime}0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad T\\Delta S^{\\circ \\prime}0\\quad\\text{(small, positive)}.\n$$\nSince $\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}$ is small and positive, the most consistent balance is that $\\Delta H^{\\circ \\prime}$ and $T\\Delta S^{\\circ \\prime}$ are both positive and of similar magnitude, with $\\Delta H^{\\circ \\prime}$ slightly larger so that $\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}=\\Delta H^{\\circ \\prime}-T\\Delta S^{\\circ \\prime}0$ but small.\n\nThis directly matches option A. Alternatives are inconsistent: option B requires both terms negative and of similar magnitude, conflicting with the conformational entropy argument; options C and D require one term to dominate strongly, contradicting the small $\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}$ for a near-equilibrium isomerization; option E implies $\\Delta H^{\\circ \\prime}0$ and $T\\Delta S^{\\circ \\prime}0$, which would make the reaction unfavorable at all temperatures and is incompatible with the observed near-equilibrium behavior.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2043267"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative intuition to quantitative analysis is central to modern biochemistry.
