By applying Coulomb's law, you will see just how dramatically water weakens these forces, a key principle governing protein structure and stability.", "problem": "An integral membrane protein possesses a crucial salt bridge within its tertiary structure, formed between the side chain of a lysine residue (protonated, net charge $+q$) and an aspartate residue (deprotonated, net charge $-q$). This salt bridge is located in a region of the protein embedded within the nonpolar lipid bilayer of a cell membrane. For biochemical analysis, the protein is extracted from the membrane and solubilized in an aqueous buffer solution. Assume the distance $r$ between the charged groups of the lysine and aspartate remains constant during this process.\n\nThe magnitude of the electrostatic force $F$ between two point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by a distance $r$ in a uniform medium is given by the modified Coulomb's Law:\n$$F = k_e \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{\\epsilon r^2}$$\nwhere $k_e$ is the electrostatic constant and $\\epsilon$ is the dimensionless relative permittivity, also known as the dielectric constant of the medium.\n\nThe effective dielectric constant of the nonpolar lipid environment is $\\epsilon_{\\text{lipid}} = 2.0$.

This thought experiment challenges you to think about this effect from a new perspective: what happens when the solvent itself changes? By predicting the fate of a micelle moved from water to a nonpolar solvent, you will deepen your understanding that the 'hydrophobic effect' is fundamentally about the system's tendency to minimize unfavorable interactions, whichever they may be [@problem_id:2087251].", "problem": "Amphipathic molecules, such as fatty acids, possess both a polar, hydrophilic \"head\" group and a long, nonpolar, hydrophobic \"tail\". When dispersed in an aqueous solution above a certain concentration, these molecules spontaneously self-assemble into spherical structures known as micelles. In a standard micelle formed in water, the hydrophobic tails are sequestered in the core, and the hydrophilic heads form the outer shell, interacting with the surrounding water molecules.\n\nConsider a stable suspension of such micelles that was initially prepared in water. This entire suspension is then transferred and thoroughly mixed into a large volume of a nonpolar organic solvent, such as liquid hexane ($C_{6}H_{14}$), and the water is subsequently removed. Predict the most thermodynamically stable conformation that the amphipathic molecules will adopt in the new nonpolar solvent environment.\n\nSelect the most accurate description from the options below.\n\nA.

The molecules will rearrange to form an extended, flat bilayer sheet, with two layers of molecules oriented tail-to-tail.", "solution": "We seek the conformation with the lowest Gibbs free energy in the new solvent. The thermodynamic criterion is minimization of the Gibbs free energy,\n$$\n\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S,\n$$\nfor the ensemble of amphipathic molecules and solvent. The key contributions are the enthalpic penalty of unfavorable polar–nonpolar contacts and the solvent entropy associated with structuring around solute surfaces.\n\nIn water, normal micelles form because exposing nonpolar tails to water imposes a large enthalpic penalty and decreases water entropy by ordering solvent around hydrophobic surfaces. Aggregation into micelles sequesters hydrophobic tails in the core and presents hydrophilic heads at the interface with water, minimizing the area of unfavorable tail–water contact and maximizing the entropy of the surrounding water.\n\nAfter transfer into a large volume of a nonpolar solvent (hexane) and removal of water, the situation inverts. The hydrophobic tails are now well solvated with hexane, while the polar head groups make unfavorable contacts with hexane. To minimize the interfacial free energy penalty, the system reduces the area of head–hexane contact. The interfacial contribution to the free energy can be written schematically as\n$$\nG_{\\text{int}} = \\gamma_{\\text{head-hexane}} A_{\\text{head-hexane}} + \\gamma_{\\text{tail-hexane}} A_{\\text{tail-hexane}},\n$$\nwith $\\gamma_{\\text{head-hexane}} \\gg \\gamma_{\\text{tail-hexane}}$, so minimizing $A_{\\text{head-hexane}}$ is favored. Aggregation of head groups into an interior domain, with tails extending into the nonpolar solvent, accomplishes this while also increasing the entropy of the bulk solvent by reducing the structuring around isolated polar groups.\n\nThe most favorable finite aggregate that minimizes exposure of head groups and avoids edge exposure is a reverse (inverted) micelle: hydrophilic heads form a shielded inner core, and hydrophobic tails contact the hexane. This is the well-established behavior of amphiphiles in nonpolar media.\n\nRuling out alternatives:\n- A is unfavorable because it maximizes polar head–hexane contact at the surface.\n- B is unfavorable because complete dissociation exposes every head group to hexane, increasing $\\Delta H$ and decreasing solvent entropy.\n- D is not required; ordered aggregates reduce interfacial penalties more effectively than a large disordered precipitate, especially at low amphiphile concentrations in a large solvent volume.\n- E (flat bilayer) would have exposed edges with head groups in contact with hexane unless it closes. In dilute nonpolar solvent, single-chain amphiphiles preferentially form reverse micelles rather than extended bilayers due to packing constraints and edge energy; closure would lead to reverse vesicles, but the simplest, most common, and thermodynamically favored small aggregate is the reverse micelle.\n\nTherefore, the molecules will reassemble into reverse micelles in hexane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2087251"}, {"introduction": "While the hydrophobic effect drives the assembly of biomolecules, biochemists often need to reverse this process, for instance, by unfolding proteins for analysis.
