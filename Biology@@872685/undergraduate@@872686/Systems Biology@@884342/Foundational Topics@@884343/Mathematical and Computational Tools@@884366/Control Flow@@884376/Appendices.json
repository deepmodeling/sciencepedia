The logic of the circuit is as follows: production of GFP is activated by the presence of an inducer molecule, Chemical X, but this activation is completely inhibited if a second molecule, Chemical Y, is also present. In essence, GFP is produced if and only if Chemical X is present and Chemical Y is absent.\n\nThe engineered bacteria are grown in a bioreactor. The culture contains a constant population of $N = 5.0 \\times 10^{8}$ cells. When the production condition is met, each cell synthesizes GFP at a constant rate of $R_p = 2.0$ arbitrary fluorescence units (AFU) per cell per minute.

The circuit consists of three genes, which we will call `genA`, `genB`, and `genC`, and their corresponding protein products, `protA`, `protB`, and `protC`. The regulatory interactions are designed such that:\n- `protA` represses the expression of `genB`.\n- `protB` represses the expression of `genC`.\n- `protC` represses the expression of `genA`.\n\nThe team models the dynamics of this circuit using a discrete time-step simulation.

The rules for updating the concentrations from time step $t$ to $t+1$ are as follows:\n\n1.  **Repression Check**: At the beginning of each time step, the concentrations from time step $t$ are used to determine which genes are repressed. A gene is considered repressed if the concentration of its specific repressor protein is strictly greater than a threshold value, $K$.\n2.  **Production**: If a gene is **not** repressed, its corresponding protein is produced, increasing its concentration by a fixed amount $p$ during the time step. If a gene **is** repressed, there is no production of its corresponding protein.\n3.  **Degradation**: In every time step, all proteins undergo degradation, causing the concentration of each protein (`protA`, `protB`, and `protC`) to decrease by a fixed amount $d$.\n4.  **Non-negativity**: Protein concentrations cannot be negative.
