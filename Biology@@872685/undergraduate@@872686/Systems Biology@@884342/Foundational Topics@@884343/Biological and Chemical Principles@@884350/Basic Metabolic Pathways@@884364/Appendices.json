This practice problem puts you in the shoes of a biochemist deciphering the fate of individual atoms as they travel through a metabolic route. By tracking a $^{13}$C label from glucose to pyruvate, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the precise, step-by-step chemical rearrangements that occur, especially the crucial split of a six-carbon sugar into two three-carbon molecules [@problem_id:1417704].", "problem": "In a metabolic labeling experiment, a culture of eukaryotic cells is grown in a medium where the only carbohydrate source is a specially synthesized glucose. In this glucose, the carbon atom at the C-3 position is a stable isotope, carbon-13 ($^{13}$C), while all other carbon atoms are the common isotope, carbon-12 ($^{12}$C). The cells metabolize this glucose completely through the glycolytic pathway to produce two molecules of pyruvate per molecule of glucose.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, the carbons in pyruvate are numbered as follows: C-1 is the carboxyl carbon, C-2 is the keto carbon, and C-3 is the methyl carbon.\n\nAssuming the glycolytic pathway proceeds as standard, which of the following statements accurately describes the location of the $^{13}$C label in the two pyruvate molecules that result from the metabolism of a single molecule of this labeled glucose?\n\nA.

One pyruvate molecule is labeled at the C-2 (keto) position, and the other pyruvate molecule is labeled at the C-1 (carboxyl) position.", "solution": "To solve this, we must trace the fate of the labeled carbon atom through the glycolytic pathway.\n1. The starting material is glucose labeled with $^{13}\\text{C}$ at the C-3 position.\n2. The initial steps of glycolysis convert glucose into fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). These isomerizations and phosphorylations do not alter the carbon skeleton's sequence. Therefore, FBP is also labeled at its C-3 position.\n3. The enzyme aldolase cleaves FBP between C-3 and C-4.\n    - The \"top half\" carbons (C-1, C-2, C-3 of FBP) form dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP).\n    - The \"bottom half\" carbons (C-4, C-5, C-6 of FBP) form glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP).\n4. Our $^{13}\\text{C}$ label, which was at FBP C-3, is therefore located on the C-3 of the resulting DHAP molecule. The GAP molecule formed at this stage is unlabeled.\n5. The enzyme triose phosphate isomerase catalyzes the interconversion of DHAP and GAP. The carbon atoms map directly: DHAP C-1 becomes GAP C-1, DHAP C-2 becomes GAP C-2, and DHAP C-3 becomes GAP C-3.\n6. Thus, the labeled DHAP (labeled at C-3) is converted into a labeled GAP, also labeled at its C-3 position.\n7. The second half of glycolysis converts GAP into pyruvate. The carbon backbone is preserved during these reactions:\n    - GAP C-1 (the aldehyde carbon) becomes pyruvate C-1 (the carboxyl carbon).\n    - GAP C-2 becomes pyruvate C-2 (the keto carbon).\n    - GAP C-3 becomes pyruvate C-3 (the methyl carbon).\n8. Therefore, the pyruvate molecule derived from the labeled GAP (which came from the top half of glucose via DHAP) will have the $^{13}\\text{C}$ label at its C-3 (methyl) position.\n9. The other pyruvate molecule, derived from the initially formed unlabeled GAP (which came from the bottom half of glucose), will be unlabeled.\n\nIn summary, one molecule of glucose labeled at C-3 yields two pyruvate molecules: one is labeled at the C-3 (methyl) position, and the other is unlabeled.

This exercise introduces the concept of metabolic control by simulating the effect of an enzyme inhibitor on the glycolytic pathway. Predicting the immediate changes in metabolite concentrations when an enzyme is blocked helps develop a systems-level intuition for how \"traffic jams\" occur in metabolism, a key skill for understanding disease states and drug actions [@problem_id:1417746].", "problem": "In a biochemical experiment, a culture of cells is maintained under conditions where glycolysis is proceeding at a steady state. This means that for each intermediate in the pathway, its rate of formation is equal to its rate of consumption. We focus on the reaction catalyzed by the glycolytic enzyme enolase, which converts its substrate, 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG), into the product, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP).\n\nAt time $t_0$, a high concentration of fluoride ions, a known and potent inhibitor of enolase, is suddenly introduced into the cell culture. Assume that the activity of all other enzymes in the pathway and the rate of glucose uptake by the cells remain constant for a short period immediately following the addition of the inhibitor.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate change in the intracellular concentrations of 2-phosphoglycerate ([2-PG]) and phosphoenolpyruvate ([PEP]) at times just after $t_0$?\n\nA.

This implies that the rate of formation equals the rate of consumption for each:\n$$\n\\frac{d[2\\text{-PG}]}{dt} = v_{M} - v_{E} = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad v_{M} = v_{E}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\text{PEP}]}{dt} = v_{E} - v_{PK} = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad v_{E} = v_{PK}\n$$\nTherefore, at the initial steady state, $v_{M} = v_{E} = v_{PK}$.\n\nAt time $t_{0}$, fluoride is added, potently inhibiting enolase. This reduces the rate of the enolase reaction. Let's denote the rates immediately after inhibition with a prime ('). The rate $v_{E}$ decreases, so $v_{E}' < v_{E}$. By the problem's assumption, the other rates remain constant initially, so $v_{M}' = v_{M}$ and $v_{PK}' = v_{PK}$.\n\nNow we can analyze the rate of change of the concentrations immediately after $t_{0}$:\nFor 2-PG:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d[2\\text{-PG}]}{dt}\\right|_{t_{0}^{+}} = v_{M}' - v_{E}' = v_{M} - v_{E}'\n$$\nSince we know from the steady-state condition that $v_{M} = v_{E}$, and the inhibition causes $v_{E}' < v_{E}$, it follows that $v_{M} > v_{E}'$. Therefore, the rate of change is positive:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d[2\\text{-PG}]}{dt}\\right|_{t_{0}^{+}} > 0\n$$\nThis means the concentration of 2-PG, [2-PG], will increase.\n\nFor PEP:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d[\\text{PEP}]}{dt}\\right|_{t_{0}^{+}} = v_{E}' - v_{PK}' = v_{E}' - v_{PK}\n$$\nFrom the steady state, we know $v_{PK} = v_{E}$.

Therefore, the rate of change is negative:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d[\\text{PEP}]}{dt}\\right|_{t_{0}^{+}}  0\n$$\nThis means the concentration of PEP, [PEP], will decrease.\n\nIn conclusion, immediately after adding the fluoride inhibitor, [2-PG] will increase, and [PEP] will decrease.
