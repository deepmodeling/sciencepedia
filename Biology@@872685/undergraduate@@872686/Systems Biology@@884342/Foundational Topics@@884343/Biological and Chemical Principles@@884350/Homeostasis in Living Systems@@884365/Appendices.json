They are removed from the surface through two distinct pathways: a basal, stimulus-independent internalization process with a first-order rate constant $k_{basal}$, and a stimulus-dependent internalization process whose rate is proportional to the number of ligand-bound receptors, $R_{bound}(t)$, with a rate constant $k_{int}$.\n\nThe number of bound receptors is described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics relating it to the total number of surface receptors $R(t)$ and the extracellular stimulus concentration $S$:\n$$R_{bound}(t) = R(t) \\frac{S}{K_D + S}$$\nwhere $K_D$ is the ligand-receptor dissociation constant.
