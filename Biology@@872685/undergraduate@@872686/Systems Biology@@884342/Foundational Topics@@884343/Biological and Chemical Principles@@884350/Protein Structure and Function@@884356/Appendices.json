This is destabilizing, but it lacks the large electrostatic desolvation penalty associated with charged residues.\n- Val112 $\\rightarrow$ Phe: Phenylalanine is hydrophobic and larger; while it may introduce steric strain if the core cannot accommodate the bulk, it preserves hydrophobic character and can sometimes improve packing. Without specific steric constraints stated, its effect is less predictably and generally less severely destabilizing than burying a charge.\n- Val112 $\\rightarrow$ Asp: Aspartic acid introduces a carboxylate group that is typically negatively charged.
