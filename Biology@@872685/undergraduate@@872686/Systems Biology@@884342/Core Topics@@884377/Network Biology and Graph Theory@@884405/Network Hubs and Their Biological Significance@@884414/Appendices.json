Proteins with a high number of connections, known as hubs, are critical for network stability. Hubs can be broadly classified into two types: 'party' hubs and 'date' hubs. 'Party' hubs interact with most of their partners simultaneously, acting as core components of stable protein complexes. 'Date' hubs, in contrast, interact with different partners at different times or locations, often mediating transient signaling pathways.\n\nA common proxy for simultaneous interaction is the co-expression of genes. The Pearson correlation coefficient, $r$, between the expression profiles of a hub gene and a partner gene can be used to infer their functional relationship. High positive correlations suggest simultaneous activity.\n\nTo create a continuous scale from 'date'-like to 'party'-like behavior, a \"Partisanship Index\" ($S_P$) is proposed. This index is designed to be high for 'party' hubs (which exhibit consistent, strong positive co-expression with their partners) and low for 'date' hubs (which show more varied or less positive co-expression).\n\nThe Partisanship Index is defined as:\n$$S_P = f_{+} \\cdot \\langle r \\rangle_{+} \\cdot (1 - \\sigma_{r,+})$$\nwhere:\n- $N$ is the total number of interaction partners for the hub.\n- $N_{+}$ is the number of partners with a positive correlation coefficient ($r > 0$).\n- $f_{+} = N_{+}/N$ is the fraction of partners with positive correlation.\n- $\\langle r \\rangle_{+}$ is the arithmetic mean of the positive correlation coefficients only.\n- $\\sigma_{r,+}$ is the population standard deviation of the positive correlation coefficients only.\n- If $N_{+} = 0$, the index $S_P$ is defined to be $0$.\n- If $N_{+} = 1$, the standard deviation $\\sigma_{r,+}$ is defined to be $0$.\n\nConsider a newly discovered hub protein, \"Kinetex,\" which has 10 interaction partners.
