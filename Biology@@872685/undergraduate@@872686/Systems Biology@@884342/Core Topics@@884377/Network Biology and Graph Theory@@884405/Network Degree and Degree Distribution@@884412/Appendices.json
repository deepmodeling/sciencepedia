The degree of each protein, which represents the number of other proteins it directly interacts with *within this specific sub-network*, has been determined. The list of degrees for these 8 proteins is given as follows: {4, 3, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2}.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the total number of unique protein-protein interactions (edges) in this sub-network.", "solution": "Model the sub-network as an undirected simple graph $G=(V,E)$ where proteins are nodes and physical interactions are edges.

This practice introduces the essential concepts of in-degree ($k_{\\text{in}}$) and out-degree ($k_{\\text{out}}$) and explores how to account for self-loops, a common motif representing autoregulation. By analyzing a small regulatory network, you will see how these refined degree metrics capture the specific roles of nodes as regulators versus targets [@problem_id:1451645].", "problem": "In the study of systems biology, Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) are often modeled as directed graphs. In this representation, the nodes of the graph correspond to genes, and a directed edge from a gene `X` to a gene `Y` indicates that the protein product of `X`, which is a Transcription Factor (TF), binds to the promoter region of `Y` to regulate its expression. The number of incoming edges to a node is its in-degree ($k_{\\text{in}}$), representing the number of TFs that regulate that gene. The number of outgoing edges from a node is its out-degree ($k_{\\text{out}}$), representing the number of target genes that the TF produced by that gene regulates.\n\nConsider the following simplified GRN involving five genes: `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and `E`. The regulatory interactions are as follows:\n- The protein product of gene `A` is a TF that activates the expression of gene `B`.\n- The protein product of gene `E` is a TF that also activates the expression of gene `B`.\n- The protein product of gene `B` is a TF that performs three regulatory actions:\n    1. It activates the expression of gene `C`.\n    2. It activates the expression of gene `D`.\n    3. It binds to its own promoter to inhibit its own expression, a process known as negative autoregulation.\n\nBased on this network description, what are the in-degree ($k_{\\text{in}}$) and out-degree ($k_{\\text{out}}$) of the node representing gene `B`?\n\nA. $k_{in} = 2, k_{out} = 2$\n\nB. $k_{in} = 2, k_{out} = 3$\n\nC. $k_{in} = 3, k_{out} = 2$\n\nD. $k_{in} = 3, k_{out} = 3$\n\nE. $k_{in} = 5, k_{out} = 5$", "solution": "We represent the GRN as a directed graph. Each directed edge $X \\to Y$ indicates that the TF produced by gene $X$ regulates gene $Y$. The in-degree of a node is the number of incoming edges, and the out-degree is the number of outgoing edges. A self-loop $B \\to B$ contributes one to both the in-degree and the out-degree of node $B$ because it is both an incoming and an outgoing edge for $B$.\n\nFrom the description, the edges involving $B$ are:\n- Incoming to $B$: $A \\to B$ and $E \\to B$. Due to negative autoregulation, $B \\to B$ is also an incoming edge to $B$.\n- Outgoing from $B$: $B \\to C$, $B \\to D$, and $B \\to B$ (autoregulation).\n\nTherefore, the in-degree and out-degree for node B are:\n$$k_{\\text{in}}(B) = 3 \\quad (\\text{from } A, E, B),$$\n$$k_{\\text{out}}(B) = 3 \\quad (\\text{to } C, D, B).$$\n\nThus the correct option is $D$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1451645"}, {"introduction": "Beyond describing a network as a whole, degree distributions allow us to formulate and test specific biological hypotheses. This final exercise demonstrates a powerful, real-world application by asking you to compare the connectivity profiles of two distinct groups of proteins within a larger interactome.

The complete network consists of 1000 distinct proteins. The team is particularly interested in a family of 50 proteins, which they have classified as \"Signal Transduction Hubs\" (STH). They hypothesize that STH proteins have a different connectivity profile compared to the other 950 proteins in the network. To investigate this, they have compiled the degree (number of interaction partners) for every protein. The data is summarized in the frequency table below, which shows the number of proteins having a specific degree for both the STH group and the group of \"Other\" proteins.\n\n| Degree | Number of STH Proteins | Number of Other Proteins |\n|:------:|:----------------------:|:------------------------:|\n| 2      | 2                      | 380                      |\n| 5      | 8                      | 320                      |\n| 12     | 15                     | 175                      |\n| 25     | 18                     | 60                       |\n| 60     | 7                      | 15                       |\n\nTo quantify the difference between the two degree distributions, you are tasked with calculating a test statistic.
