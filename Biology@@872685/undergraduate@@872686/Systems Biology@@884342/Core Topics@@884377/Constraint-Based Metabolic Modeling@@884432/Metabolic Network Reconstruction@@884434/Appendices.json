This matrix provides a concise mathematical representation of all the reactions and metabolites within a biological system. By convention, the rows of the matrix correspond to the metabolites and the columns correspond to the reactions. The entries of the matrix, $S_{ij}$, represent the stoichiometric coefficient of metabolite $i$ in reaction $j$. A positive coefficient indicates that the metabolite is produced, while a negative coefficient indicates that it is consumed.\n\nConsider a simplified metabolic model for a hypothetical microorganism. The set of all metabolites considered in this model is: external Glucose (Glc_ext), Glucose (Glc), Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP), Glucose-6-Phosphate (G6P), inorganic phosphate (Pi), and Trehalose.\n\nThe network consists of the following four reactions:\n\n*   **R1:** Glc_ext $\\rightarrow$ Glc\n*   **R2:** Glc + ATP $\\rightarrow$ G6P + ADP\n*   **R3:** G6P $\\rightarrow$ Glc + Pi\n*   **R4:** 2 Glc $\\rightarrow$ Trehalose\n\nYour task is to determine the dimensions of the stoichiometric matrix $S$ for this network, which are the number of rows (metabolites) $m$ and the number of columns (reactions) $n$.
