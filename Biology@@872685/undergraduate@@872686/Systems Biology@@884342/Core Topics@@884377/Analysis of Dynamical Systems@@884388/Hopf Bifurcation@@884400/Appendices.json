The real part of these eigenvalues is given by $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{tr}(J)$. For a Hopf bifurcation to occur, the real part of the eigenvalues, $\\alpha$, must change sign as a parameter is varied. This means $\\alpha$ must be able to take on non-zero values.\n\nHowever, for a 2D Hamiltonian system, we have just shown that $\\text{tr}(J)$ is always zero. This implies that the real part of the eigenvalues, $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{tr}(J) = \\frac{1}{2}(0)$, is always zero. Since the real part of the eigenvalues can never be non-zero, it can never change sign. The eigenvalues are thus permanently on the imaginary axis (for a center equilibrium, where $\\det(J)0$) or on the real axis (for a saddle equilibrium, where $\\det(J)0$). They cannot \"cross\" the imaginary axis, which is the defining feature of a Hopf bifurcation.\n\nTherefore, the property that makes a Hopf bifurcation impossible in such a system is that the trace of the Jacobian matrix is always zero.
