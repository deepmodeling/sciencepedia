Let $[Ca^{2+}]_{cyt}$ be the concentration of calcium ions in the cytosol. The dynamics of the oscillation are governed by the following rules:\n\n1.  **Slow Fill Phase**: The cycle begins with the cytosolic calcium at a basal concentration, $C_{basal}$. A constant, slow influx of calcium into the cytosol, characterized by a rate $J_{in}$ (concentration per unit time), causes $[Ca^{2+}]_{cyt}$ to rise.\n\n2.  **Threshold-Triggered Release**: When $[Ca^{2+}]_{cyt}$ reaches a critical threshold concentration, $C_{thresh}$, it triggers a massive and instantaneous release of calcium from the ER. This release abruptly increases the cytosolic calcium concentration by a fixed amount, $\\Delta C$.\n\n3.  **Fast Pump Phase**: The resulting high calcium concentration activates a powerful pump that transports calcium from the cytosol back into the ER at a constant rate of $J_{pump}$. This pumping process continues until $[Ca^{2+}]_{cyt}$ is restored to the basal level, $C_{basal}$. During this phase, the slow influx $J_{in}$ is still active. You may assume that $J_{pump} > J_{in}$ to ensure the system can reset.\n\nBased on this model, derive an expression for the period, $T$, of one full oscillation cycle in terms of the given parameters: $C_{basal}$, $C_{thresh}$, $\\Delta C$, $J_{in}$, and $J_{pump}$.", "solution": "Let $C(t)$ denote the cytosolic calcium concentration $[Ca^{2+}]_{cyt}$.\n\nSlow fill phase:\nBy assumption, the influx is constant at rate $J_{in}$, so the dynamics satisfy\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt}=J_{in}.\n$$\nStarting from $C(0)=C_{basal}$, the time $t_{fill}$ to reach $C_{thresh}$ is obtained by integrating\n$$\n\\int_{C_{basal}}^{C_{thresh}} dC=\\int_{0}^{t_{fill}} J_{in}\\, dt \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad C_{thresh}-C_{basal}=J_{in}\\, t_{fill},\n$$\nhence\n$$\nt_{fill}=\\frac{C_{thresh}-C_{basal}}{J_{in}}.\n$$\n\nThreshold-triggered release:\nAt $C=C_{thresh}$, an instantaneous release increases $C$ by $\\Delta C$, so $C$ jumps to $C_{thresh}+\\Delta C$.
