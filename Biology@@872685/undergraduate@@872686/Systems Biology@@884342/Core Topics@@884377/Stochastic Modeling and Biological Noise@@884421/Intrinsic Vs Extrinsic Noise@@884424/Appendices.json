This first exercise [@problem_id:1440232] is a foundational practice in calculating this value from basic experimental data, allowing you to put a single number on the overall noise affecting a protein's expression across a cell population.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment, a population of genetically identical E. coli bacteria is engineered to constitutively express a fluorescent protein. Due to the inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes, the number of protein molecules is not the same in every cell. Using fluorescence microscopy and single-cell analysis, a researcher characterizes the statistical distribution of the protein count across a large population of these cells.\n\nThe analysis yields the following results:\n- The mean (average) number of protein molecules per cell is 200.\n- The variance in the number of protein molecules across the cell population is $4000 \\text{ molecules}^2$.\n\nThe total noise in gene expression is often quantified by the squared coefficient of variation, which is the ratio of the variance to the square of the mean. Calculate this value and choose the option below that provides both the correct numerical value and the most accurate physical interpretation.\n\nA. The value is 0.1. This represents the total noise, quantifying the overall cell-to-cell variability in protein levels from all combined sources of randomness.\nB. The value is 20. This indicates that the system's noise is 20 times greater than that of a purely Poissonian process, where the variance equals the mean.\nC. The value is 0.1. This represents only the intrinsic noise, which arises from the random timing of transcription and translation events for this specific gene.\nD. The value is 0.005. This represents the extrinsic noise, which arises from variations in shared cellular components like ribosomes and polymerases.\nE. The value is 10. This is the inverse of the total noise and indicates a high degree of precision in protein expression.", "solution": "We are given the mean protein count per cell, denoted by $\\mu$, and the variance across the population, denoted by $\\sigma^2$.

The dual-reporter assay is the workhorse experimental strategy for this task, using two differently colored fluorescent proteins driven by identical promoters to distinguish between shared and gene-specific fluctuations. This practice [@problem_id:1440246] walks you through the analysis of data from such an experiment, showing how the covariance between the two reporter signals directly isolates the extrinsic component and allows for the quantification of intrinsic noise.", "problem": "A systems biologist is investigating gene expression noise in a developing embryo. The expression of a particular gene is activated by a signaling molecule called a morphogen. To dissect the sources of fluctuation in the gene's protein product, the biologist engineers a cell line with a synthetic dual-reporter system. In this system, two different reporter proteins, Protein A and Protein B, are expressed from two distinct genes. However, both genes are placed under the control of identical promoters, meaning they are activated by the same upstream cellular machinery in response to the morphogen.\n\nAfter measuring the concentrations of Protein A and Protein B in a large population of individual cells, the following statistical properties were determined. The concentrations are measured in arbitrary units (a.u.).\n\n- The mean concentration of Protein A, $\\langle P_A \\rangle = 120 \\text{ a.u.}$\n- The mean concentration of Protein B, $\\langle P_B \\rangle = 120 \\text{ a.u.}$\n- The variance of the concentration of Protein A, $\\text{Var}(P_A) = 6400 \\text{ (a.u.)}^2$.\n- The variance of the concentration of Protein B, $\\text{Var}(P_B) = 6400 \\text{ (a.u.)}^2$.\n- The covariance of the concentrations of Protein A and Protein B, $\\text{Cov}(P_A, P_B) = 4800 \\text{ (a.u.)}^2$.\n\nThe total noise in the expression of a single protein can be modeled as the sum of two components: intrinsic noise and extrinsic noise. Intrinsic noise arises from stochastic events inherent to the gene expression process itself (e.g., random binding/unbinding of transcription factors to a specific gene's promoter). Extrinsic noise originates from fluctuations in the cellular environment that affect the expression of all genes in a similar manner (e.g., cell-to-cell variations in morphogen concentration or the number of ribosomes).\n\nAssuming the total variance of a single reporter protein's concentration is the sum of the intrinsic noise variance ($\\sigma^2_{int}$) and the extrinsic noise variance ($\\sigma^2_{ext}$), calculate the ratio of the intrinsic noise variance to the total noise variance, $\\frac{\\sigma^2_{int}}{\\sigma^2_{total}}$. Express your answer as a real number rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of the intrinsic noise variance to the total noise variance, $\\frac{\\sigma^2_{int}}{\\sigma^2_{total}}$.\n\nThe fundamental idea behind the dual-reporter assay is to separate correlated and uncorrelated fluctuations. Extrinsic noise, by definition, affects both reporter genes in a correlated way because it stems from shared cellular components or environmental signals. Intrinsic noise affects each reporter gene independently.\n\nThe total noise for a single reporter, say Protein A, is given by its variance. This total variance is the sum of the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions.\n$$ \\sigma^2_{total} = \\text{Var}(P_A) = \\sigma^2_{int} + \\sigma^2_{ext} $$\n\nThe key insight is how to use the provided statistical measures to determine each component.\nThe covariance between the two reporters, $\\text{Cov}(P_A, P_B)$, measures the extent to which their expression levels fluctuate together. Since only extrinsic noise affects both reporters simultaneously, the covariance is a direct measure of the extrinsic noise variance.\n$$ \\sigma^2_{ext} = \\text{Cov}(P_A, P_B) $$\nThis is because any intrinsic fluctuation in Protein A is independent of any intrinsic fluctuation in Protein B, so their contribution to the covariance is zero.\n\nThe total noise is simply the variance of one of the reporters. Since they are driven by identical promoters, their total variances are expected to be the same, as confirmed by the provided data.\n$$ \\sigma^2_{total} = \\text{Var}(P_A) = \\text{Var}(P_B) $$\n\nNow we can write an expression for the intrinsic noise variance.
