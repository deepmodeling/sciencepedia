The production of a single protein molecule is a stochastic event that occurs with a constant average rate of production, denoted by $k$. Each fluorescent protein molecule, once synthesized, can be independently and stochastically degraded. The probability per unit time that any single protein molecule is degraded is a constant, $\\gamma$. Let $n$ be the number of fluorescent protein molecules in the bacterium at a given time.\n\nAfter the system has been operating for a very long time and has reached a statistical equilibrium, what is the probability distribution, $P(n)$, of finding exactly $n$ fluorescent protein molecules in a single bacterium? Express your answer for $P(n)$ as a function of the number of molecules $n$, the production rate $k$, and the per-molecule degradation rate constant $\\gamma$.", "solution": "Let $P(n, t)$ be the probability of having $n$ molecules in the cell at time $t$. The state of the system is the integer $n$. We can model the time evolution of $P(n, t)$ using a chemical master equation, which accounts for the probability fluxes into and out of state $n$.\n\nThe two processes changing the number of molecules are:\n1.  **Production (Birth):** A new molecule is produced at a constant rate $k$. This process transitions the system from state $n-1$ to state $n$. The rate of this transition is $k$.\n2.  **Degradation (Death):** An existing molecule is degraded. If there are $n$ molecules, and each degrades independently with a rate constant $\\gamma$, the total rate of degradation for the cell is $n\\gamma$. This process transitions the system from state $n$ to state $n-1$.\n\nThe master equation for the state $n$ is given by the balance of probability fluxes:\n$$ \\frac{dP(n,t)}{dt} = (\\text{flux into state } n) - (\\text{flux out of state } n) $$\n\nThe flux into state $n$ comes from two sources:\n- Production from state $n-1$: The rate is $k P(n-1, t)$.\n- Degradation from state $n+1$: The rate is $\\gamma(n+1) P(n+1, t)$.\n\nThe flux out of state $n$ also has two contributions:\n- Production from state $n$: This leads to state $n+1$. The rate is $k P(n, t)$.\n- Degradation from state $n$: This leads to state $n-1$. The rate is $\\gamma n P(n, t)$.\n\nCombining these terms, the master equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dP(n,t)}{dt} = \\left[ k P(n-1, t) + \\gamma(n+1) P(n+1, t) \\right] - \\left[ k P(n, t) + \\gamma n P(n, t) \\right] $$\nThis equation holds for $n \\ge 1$. For $n=0$, there can be no degradation, so the equation is slightly different:\n$$ \\frac{dP(0,t)}{dt} = \\gamma(1) P(1, t) - k P(0, t) $$\n\nThe problem asks for the probability distribution at statistical equilibrium, which is the steady-state distribution. In steady state, the probabilities are no longer changing with time, so $\\frac{dP(n,t)}{dt} = 0$ for all $n$. Let's denote the steady-state probability as $P(n)$.\n\nSetting the time derivatives to zero, we get:\nFor $n \\ge 1$:\n$$ 0 = k P(n-1) + \\gamma(n+1) P(n+1) - (k + \\gamma n) P(n) $$\nFor $n = 0$:\n$$ 0 = \\gamma P(1) - k P(0) \\implies k P(0) = \\gamma P(1) $$\n\nFor a one-dimensional system like this, the steady-state condition implies that the net probability flux between any two adjacent states must be zero. This is the principle of detailed balance. The flux from state $n$ to $n+1$ must equal the flux from state $n+1$ to $n$.\n$$ \\text{Flux}(n \\to n+1) = \\text{Flux}(n+1 \\to n) $$\n$$ k P(n) = \\gamma (n+1) P(n+1) $$\n\nThis single relation holds for all $n \\ge 0$ and is equivalent to the full set of steady-state master equations. We now have a recurrence relation for the probabilities:\n$$ P(n+1) = \\frac{k}{\\gamma(n+1)} P(n) $$\n\nWe can solve this by iteration:\nFor $n=0$: $P(1) = \\frac{k}{\\gamma(1)} P(0)$\nFor $n=1$: $P(2) = \\frac{k}{\\gamma(2)} P(1) = \\frac{k}{2\\gamma} \\left(\\frac{k}{\\gamma} P(0)\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{k}{\\gamma}\\right)^2 P(0)$\nFor $n=2$: $P(3) = \\frac{k}{\\gamma(3)} P(2) = \\frac{k}{3\\gamma} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{k}{\\gamma}\\right)^2 P(0)\\right) = \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot 2} \\left(\\frac{k}{\\gamma}\\right)^3 P(0) = \\frac{1}{3!} \\left(\\frac{k}{\\gamma}\\right)^3 P(0)$\n\nBy induction, we can see the general pattern:\n$$ P(n) = \\frac{1}{n!} \\left(\\frac{k}{\\gamma}\\right)^n P(0) $$\n\nTo find $P(0)$, we use the normalization condition that the sum of all probabilities must be 1:\n$$ \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} P(n) = 1 $$\n$$ \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n!} \\left(\\frac{k}{\\gamma}\\right)^n P(0) = 1 $$\n$$ P(0) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n!} \\left(\\frac{k}{\\gamma}\\right)^n = 1 $$\n\nWe recognize the sum as the Taylor series expansion for the exponential function, $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!} = \\exp(x)$, with $x = k/\\gamma$.\n$$ P(0) \\exp\\left(\\frac{k}{\\gamma}\\right) = 1 $$\n$$ P(0) = \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{k}{\\gamma}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k}{\\gamma}\\right) $$\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $P(0)$ back into our formula for $P(n)$:\n$$ P(n) = \\frac{1}{n!} \\left(\\frac{k}{\\gamma}\\right)^n \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k}{\\gamma}\\right) $$\nThis is the Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda = k/\\gamma$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\left(\\frac{k}{\\gamma}\\right)^{n} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k}{\\gamma}\\right)}{n!}}$$", "id": "1468478"}, {"introduction": "While analytical solutions are powerful, many biological systems are too complex to solve on paper.
