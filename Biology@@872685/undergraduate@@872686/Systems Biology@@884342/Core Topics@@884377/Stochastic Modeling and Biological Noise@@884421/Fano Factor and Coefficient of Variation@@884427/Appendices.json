The true biological process is \"sub-Poissonian,\" meaning the variance is less than the mean. For systems with very strong noise suppression, the variance can become sufficiently small that the Fano factor becomes negative.\n\nB. The student likely made a mistake in calculating the sample variance. The sample variance, by its mathematical definition, cannot be a negative number for any set of real-valued data, making a negative Fano factor arithmetically impossible when the mean is positive.\n\nC. A negative Fano factor indicates strong negative feedback in the gene regulatory network. This feedback actively suppresses expression fluctuations to such an extent that the variance becomes negative relative to the mean.\n\nD. The definition of the Fano factor is strictly valid only for random variables that follow a Poisson distribution. Since protein counts in a cell typically follow a more complex distribution, the Fano factor can yield unphysical negative results when applied to non-Poissonian data.\n\nE.
