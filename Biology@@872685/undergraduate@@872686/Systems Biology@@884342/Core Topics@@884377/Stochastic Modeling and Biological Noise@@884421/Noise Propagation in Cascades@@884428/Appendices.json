A key challenge is managing the inherent stochasticity, or noise, in gene expression. Consider a scenario where we want to control the expression of a protein, P, using transcription factors (TFs). The noise in the concentration of any protein is quantified by its squared Coefficient of Variation (CV²), denoted as $\\eta = \\sigma^2 / \\mu^2$, where $\\mu$ is the mean concentration and $\\sigma^2$ is the variance.\n\nThe total noise in the output protein P, $\\eta_P$, is the sum of two components: an intrinsic noise component, $\\eta_{int}$, arising from the stochastic nature of transcription and translation of gene P itself, and a propagated extrinsic noise component, $\\eta_{prop}$, which comes from fluctuations in upstream regulators like TFs. Thus, $\\eta_P = \\eta_{int} + \\eta_{prop}$. The production rate of protein P is linearly proportional to the total concentration of the activating TFs.

They are sourced from identical, independent gene circuits, such that each has a noise level of $\\eta_{ext}$.
