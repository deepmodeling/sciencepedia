A central insight from the two-state model is that cells can tune either the frequency or the size of transcriptional bursts to control gene expression.

Instead, many genes exhibit transcriptional bursting, where they stochastically switch between an active 'ON' state, producing messenger RNA (mRNA), and an inactive 'OFF' state. This behavior can be characterized by two key parameters: the burst frequency, which is the rate at which the gene switches ON, and the burst size, which is the average number of mRNA molecules produced during a single ON period.\n\nAn experimental biologist is studying the expression of a specific gene in two different genetically-engineered cell populations, Population A and Population B, using single-molecule Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (smFISH). For the simplified model of bursting that applies to this gene, the mean number of mRNA molecules per cell, $\\langle m \\rangle$, is given by the product of the burst frequency ($f_{burst}$), the mean burst size ($b$), and the average lifetime of an mRNA molecule ($\\tau_m$). The cell-to-cell variability in mRNA count can be quantified by the Fano factor, $F = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\langle m \\rangle}$, where $\\sigma^2$ is the variance of the mRNA count distribution.
