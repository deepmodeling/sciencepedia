[@problem_id:1469992]", "problem": "In systems biology, simple gene regulatory networks can be modeled using a Boolean framework to understand their dynamic behaviors. Consider a simplified two-gene system involving Gene A and Gene B. The state of each gene can be either 'ON' (represented by 1) or 'OFF' (represented by 0). The state of the entire system at any discrete time step $t$ is given by the pair of values $(A(t), B(t))$.\n\nThe regulatory interactions are as follows:\n1.  Gene A activates Gene B. This means Gene B will be 'ON' at the next time step, $t+1$, if and only if Gene A is 'ON' at the current time step $t$.\n2.  Gene B represses Gene A. This means Gene A will be 'ON' at the next time step, $t+1$, if and only if Gene B is 'OFF' at the current time step $t$.\n\nThe system updates its state synchronously, meaning the states of both Gene A and Gene B at time $t+1$ are determined simultaneously based on the system's state at time $t$.\n\nA \"steady state\" is a state $(A, B)$ that does not change over time. A \"limit cycle\" is a sequence of states that the system repeates periodically. A steady state or a limit cycle is referred to as an \"attractor\" of the system, representing its long-term behavior.\n\nBased on the rules provided, identify the attractor(s) of this two-gene system.\n\nA.
