The colon is treated as a single, well-mixed compartment. The nutrient, with a concentration denoted by $N(t)$ at time $t$, is continuously introduced into this compartment at a constant rate $I$, which represents the net effect of dietary intake and absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract. This nutrient is cleared from the compartment through two primary mechanisms. First, there is a constant fractional washout or dilution due to gut motility, which occurs at a rate proportional to the nutrient's current concentration $N(t)$, governed by a dilution rate constant $d$. Second, the nutrient is consumed by a specific bacterial species. The population of this bacterium is assumed to be large and stable, maintained at a constant density $B$. The rate of nutrient consumption by this bacterial population is jointly proportional to the nutrient concentration $N(t)$ and the bacterial density $B$, with a specific consumption rate constant $k$.\n\nBased on this model, determine the steady-state concentration of the nutrient, $N_{ss}$, in the colon. Express your answer as a single symbolic expression in terms of the parameters $I$, $k$, $B$, and $d$.", "solution": "We model the colon as a single, well-mixed compartment and apply a mass balance: rate of accumulation equals inflow minus outflow and consumption. Let $N(t)$ denote the nutrient concentration. The inflow is constant at rate $I$. The washout (dilution) is a first-order loss term $d\\,N(t)$, where $d$ is the dilution rate constant. The bacterial consumption is proportional to both nutrient concentration and bacterial density, giving a first-order loss term $k B N(t)$, where $k$ is the specific consumption rate constant and $B$ is the constant bacterial density.

This process generates an intermediate metabolite, $M$, and biomass for *Species A* ($X_A$). The balanced metabolic reaction for *Species A* is:\n$$1 N \\rightarrow 2.7 M + 0.4 X_A$$\n\n*Species B* cannot utilize the primary nutrient $N$.

This means our objective is to maximize $J_B = 1.3 v_B$. Maximizing $J_B$ is equivalent to maximizing the flux $v_B$.\n\nWe must consider the constraints on the system.\nFirst, the problem states that the system is at a steady state for the intermediate metabolite $M$. This means the total rate of production of $M$ must equal the total rate of consumption of $M$.\n-   Rate of production of $M$ comes from *Species A*'s reaction. Based on its stoichiometry, the production rate is $2.7 v_A$.\n-   Rate of consumption of $M$ comes from *Species B*'s reaction.

To maximize $v_B$, we must maximize $v_A$.\n\nSecond, there is a constraint on the availability of the primary nutrient $N$. The flux of the reaction in *Species A*, which consumes $N$, is limited. The problem states that the maximum uptake flux for this reaction is $10.0 \\, \\text{mmol / (gDW} \\cdot \\text{h)}$.\nThe rate of consumption of $N$ is $1 v_A$. So, the constraint on $v_A$ is:\n$$v_A \\leq 10.0 \\, \\text{mmol / (gDW} \\cdot \\text{h)}$$\n\nAdditionally, reaction fluxes must be non-negative, as they represent the rate of a process occurring in a specific direction:\n$$v_A \\geq 0$$\n$$v_B \\geq 0$$\n\nTo maximize $v_B$, we must maximize $v_A$.
