The network consists of a set of five proteins, labeled as nodes {A, B, C, D, E}. An interaction between two proteins, represented as a directed edge, is only possible at specific, discrete time steps.\n\nThe sequence of possible interactions is given as follows:\n- At time $t=1$, interactions are possible from node A to node B, and from node A to node C.\n- At time $t=2$, interactions are possible from node B to node D, from node C to node D, and from node C to node E.\n- At time $t=3$, interactions are possible from node D to node A, and from node E to node B.\n\nA signal, modeled as a random walker, originates at node A at time $t=0$. The propagation of this signal follows a specific rule: at each time step $t$, a walker at a node $u$ **must** move to a node $v$ if a directed edge from $u$ to $v$ is active at time $t$. If multiple outgoing edges are active from its current location, any of these paths can be taken, leading to multiple possible locations for the walker at the next time step. If a walker is at a node from which there are no active outgoing edges at a given time step, it is considered trapped and is removed from the network.\n\nBased on these rules, determine the complete set of all possible locations for the signal walker at time $t=3$.\n\nA. {A}\n\nB. {B}\n\nC. {A, B}\n\nD. {D, E}\n\nE. {A, B, C}\n\nF.
