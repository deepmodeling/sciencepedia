The pathway consists of two steps: S is first converted to an intermediate, I, by enzyme A. Then, I is converted to P by enzyme B. The rate of production of the intermediate I is governed by enzyme A, and its rate of consumption is governed by enzyme B.\n\nThe rate of consumption of the intermediate I, denoted as $v_B$, follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics:\n$$\nv_B = \\frac{V_{\\max,B} [I]}{K_{M,B} + [I]}\n$$\nwhere $[I]$ is the concentration of the intermediate, $V_{\\max,B}$ is the maximum rate of enzyme B, and $K_{M,B}$ is its Michaelis constant.\n\nThe external nutrient S is always present at a high, saturating concentration.

The population consists of two strains: a wild-type strain (W) and a strain (P) that carries a plasmid.\n\nThe wild-type strain W has an intrinsic growth rate of $r_0$.\nThe P strain's plasmid imposes a metabolic burden, reducing its intrinsic growth rate by a constant amount $c$. Hence, its growth rate is $r_0 - c$. Both $r_0$ and $c$ are positive constants, with $r_0 > c$.\n\nAn antibiotic is introduced into the culture. This antibiotic has no effect on the P strain, as the plasmid provides complete resistance. However, it induces a constant death rate, $d_a$, for the wild-type W strain.

The wild-type strain W experiences intrinsic growth rate $r_{0}$ and an antibiotic-induced death rate $d_{a}$, so its net growth rate is $r_{W}=r_{0}-d_{a}$. The plasmid-bearing strain P has intrinsic growth rate reduced by $c$, no antibiotic effect, so its net growth rate is $r_{P}=r_{0}-c$. By assumption, $r_{0}>c>0$.\n\nWith constant per capita rates, each subpopulation follows exponential growth:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_{W}}{dt}=r_{W}N_{W},\\quad \\frac{dN_{P}}{dt}=r_{P}N_{P}.\n$$\nSolving these with $N_{W}(0)>0$ and $N_{P}(0)>0$ gives\n$$\nN_{W}(t)=N_{W}(0)\\,\\exp\\!\\big((r_{0}-d_{a})t\\big),\\quad\nN_{P}(t)=N_{P}(0)\\,\\exp\\!\\big((r_{0}-c)t\\big).\n$$\n\nDefine the proportion $f_{P}(t)=\\frac{N_{P}(t)}{N_{W}(t)+N_{P}(t)}$.

The wild-type strain, denoted $G_{WT}$, has a normalized growth rate of 1.0 in a standard drug-free medium. A new antibiotic is introduced, which targets an essential protein. In the presence of this antibiotic, the growth rate of $G_{WT}$ is reduced to 0.2.\n\nA resistant mutant, $G_{DR}$, emerges. The mutation alters the conformation of the target protein, conferring resistance. In the presence of the antibiotic, $G_{DR}$ thrives with a growth rate of 1.1. However, the conformational change comes at a cost: in a drug-free medium, the altered protein is less efficient, and the growth rate of $G_{DR}$ is only 0.85. This is an example of an evolutionary trade-off.\n\nFurther investigation reveals a hidden vulnerability. The altered protein in $G_{DR}$ is structurally unstable and heavily dependent on a specific cellular chaperone protein for correct folding. A chemical inhibitor for this chaperone is discovered. In the presence of this inhibitor (and in the absence of the antibiotic), the growth rate of the $G_{DR}$ strain plummets to 0.1 due to massive protein misfolding. The $G_{WT}$ strain is less reliant on this specific chaperone for its more stable protein, and its growth rate is only mildly reduced to 0.9 in the presence of the inhibitor.\n\nTwo competition experiments are conducted in a chemostat, where the number of generations can be treated as a continuous variable. In both experiments, the total population size is kept constant.\n\n1.  **Experiment B (Baseline Reversion):** A culture is initiated with 1% $G_{WT}$ and 99% $G_{DR}$ cells in a drug-free medium.
