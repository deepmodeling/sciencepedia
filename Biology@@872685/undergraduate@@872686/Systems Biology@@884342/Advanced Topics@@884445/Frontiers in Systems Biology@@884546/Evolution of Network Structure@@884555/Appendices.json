This growth is often described by a 'preferential attachment' mechanism, where new nodes have a higher probability of connecting to nodes that are already highly connected.\n\nConsider a small, nascent protein interaction network composed of five distinct proteins, labeled P1 through P5. The connectivity of each protein, defined as its degree (the number of interactions it has), is given as follows:\n- Protein P1 has a degree $k_1 = 2$.\n- Protein P2 has a degree $k_2 = 4$.\n- Protein P3 has a degree $k_3 = 4$.\n- Protein P4 has a degree $k_4 = 6$.\n- Protein P5 has a degree $k_5 = 9$.\n\nA new protein, P6, is introduced into this system and forms a single new interaction with one of the five existing proteins. According to the foundational model of linear preferential attachment, the probability $\\Pi(k_i)$ that the new protein connects to an existing protein $i$ is directly proportional to the degree $k_i$ of that protein.\n\nCalculate the probability that the new protein P6 will form an interaction with the most connected protein currently in the network.

Consider a hypothetical ancestral gene, `G_anc`, which codes for a protein, `P_anc`. This gene and its protein product are part of two distinct biological networks.\n\nFirst, within a Gene Regulatory Network (GRN), `G_anc` acts as a transcription factor that both autoregulates its own expression and regulates a separate target gene, `T`. This corresponds to two directed regulatory interactions.\n\nSecond, within a Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network, the protein `P_anc` is capable of forming a homodimer (interacting with itself) and also interacting with a different partner protein, `Q`. This corresponds to two undirected physical interactions.\n\nA duplication event occurs, resulting in two identical paralogous genes, `G1` and `G2`, which produce proteins `P1` and `P2`, respectively. Initially, a state of full redundancy is assumed: both new genes/proteins inherit all the interaction capabilities of the ancestor. This means `G1` and `G2` can each regulate `G1`, `G2`, and `T`. Likewise, proteins `P1` and `P2` are each capable of interacting with `P1`, `P2`, and `Q`.\n\nFollowing this duplication, two independent evolutionary scenarios are considered:\n\n**Scenario A (GRN divergence):** The paralog `G1` undergoes mutations. Its protein product can no longer bind to the regulatory DNA sequence characteristic of the `G` gene family. As a result, `G1` can no longer regulate either `G1` or `G2`, but it retains its ability to regulate gene `T`. The regulatory abilities of `G2` are unaffected. Let `N_{GRN}` be the total number of directed regulatory interactions remaining in the GRN subsystem involving genes `G1`, `G2`, and `T`.\n\n**Scenario B (PPI divergence):** In a separate lineage, the paralogous protein `P1` undergoes mutations that disrupt its dimerization domain. As a result, `P1` can no longer interact with `P1` or `P2`, but it retains its ability to interact with protein `Q`. The interaction capabilities of `P2` are unaffected.
