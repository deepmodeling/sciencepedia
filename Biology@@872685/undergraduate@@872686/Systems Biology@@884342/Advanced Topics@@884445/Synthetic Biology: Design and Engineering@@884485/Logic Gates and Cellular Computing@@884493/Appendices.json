In synthetic biology, designing a genetic NAND gate is a classic exercise that bridges the abstract world of Boolean logic with the concrete reality of molecular interactions. This problem challenges you to identify a circuit where the output is repressed only when two distinct input signals are simultaneously present, perfectly mirroring the NAND logic. [@problem_id:1443146]", "problem": "In the field of synthetic biology, engineers design genetic circuits within cells to perform computations, analogous to electronic circuits. These circuits are built from basic components like promoters, which initiate gene expression, and regulatory proteins (repressors and activators) that modulate this expression in response to specific input molecules.\n\nConsider a simple computational task: implementing a NAND (\"Not AND\") logic gate. This gate takes two chemical inputs, Inducer 1 (In1) and Inducer 2 (In2), and produces an output, which is the expression of a reporter protein (e.g., Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)). The state \"1\" (or TRUE) corresponds to the presence of an inducer or high expression of the reporter, while \"0\" (or FALSE) corresponds to its absence or basal-level expression. The NAND gate's logic dictates that the output should be \"1\" in all cases, except when both inputs are \"1\", in which case the output is \"0\".\n\nYou are presented with four hypothetical designs for a genetic circuit intended to function as a NAND gate. Identify the design that correctly implements the specified logic.\n\nA. A single repressor protein, `R`, is constitutively expressed from a promoter `P_const`. This repressor has two distinct allosteric binding sites, one for In1 and one for In2. The repressor `R` only adopts an active conformation, allowing it to bind its target deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) operator site `O_R`, when *both* In1 and In2 are bound to it. The reporter gene is driven by a promoter `P_out` that is constitutively active but contains the operator site `O_R`.\n\nB. The reporter gene is controlled by a promoter `P_out` that has two separate operator sites, `O_1` and `O_2`. The cell constitutively produces two distinct repressor proteins, `R1` and `R2`. `R1` binds to `O_1` only in the presence of In1, and `R2` binds to `O_2` only in the presence of In2. Binding of either repressor is sufficient to halt transcription.\n\nC. The reporter gene is controlled by a special promoter, `P_and`, that requires the cooperative binding of two separate activator proteins, `A1` and `A2`, to initiate transcription. Both `A1` and `A2` are constitutively expressed. `A1` becomes an active activator only in the presence of In1, and `A2` becomes an active activator only in the presence of In2.\n\nD. The expression of a repressor protein `R` is driven by a promoter that is activated by In1. This repressor `R` is, in turn, allosterically inactivated by the binding of In2. The reporter gene is transcribed from a constitutively active promoter `P_out` that is repressed by the active form of `R`.", "solution": "Let the inputs be Boolean variables $x,y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ where $x=1$ denotes presence of In1 and $y=1$ denotes presence of In2.

The repressor $R$ is active only when both In1 and In2 are bound. Thus the active repressor state is $R_{\\text{act}}=x \\land y$. Since $P_{\\text{out}}$ is repressed by active $R$, the output is\n$$\nf=\\neg R_{\\text{act}}=\\neg(x \\land y),\n$$\nwhich is exactly NAND.\n\nB. $R1$ binds only if $x=1$ and $R2$ binds only if $y=1$.

Transcription from $P_{\\text{and}}$ requires both activators to be active; $A1$ active iff $x=1$ and $A2$ active iff $y=1$. Therefore\n$$\nf=x \\land y,\n$$\nwhich is AND, not NAND.\n\nD. $R$ expression is activated by In1, so $R$ is present when $x=1$. $R$ is allosterically inactivated by In2, so $R$ is active only if $x=1$ and $y=0$, i.e.,\n$$\nR_{\\text{act}}=x \\land \\neg y.\n$$\nSince $P_{\\text{out}}$ is repressed by active $R$, the output is\n$$\nf=\\neg(x \\land \\neg y)=\\neg x \\lor y,\n$$\nwhich is not NAND.\n\nOnly design A implements $f=\\neg(x \\land y)$.\n\nTherefore, the correct design is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1443146"}, {"introduction": "Biological systems often need to make decisions by integrating multiple, often conflicting, signals from their environment. This practice moves beyond basic two-input gates to a more sophisticated \"2-out-of-3\" majority logic circuit, which could allow a cell to respond only when a \"quorum\" of specific environmental cues is met. You will explore how a multi-stage architecture, involving an intermediate integrator protein and a sharp response threshold, can implement this complex decision-making process. [@problem_id:1443147]", "problem": "A synthetic biology research team is engineering a yeast cell to function as a \"smart therapeutic\" agent. The cell is designed to produce a therapeutic protein, which we will call Therapin (P), only in response to a complex environmental signature indicating a disease state. This signature is defined by the presence of at least two out of three distinct extracellular signaling molecules: $S_1, S_2,$ and $S_3$.\n\nThe engineering strategy relies on transcription factors (TFs). The yeast cell has been modified to constitutively express three unique, but initially inactive, transcription factors: $A_1, A_2,$ and $A_3$. Each of these TFs is designed to become active only when it binds to its specific corresponding signal molecule: $S_1$ activates $A_1$, $S_2$ activates $A_2$, and $S_3$ activates $A_3$. The absence of a signal molecule leaves the corresponding TF in its inactive state.\n\nThe team has proposed several different genetic circuit architectures to control the expression of the gene coding for Therapin (P). Your task is to analyze these proposals and identify the one that correctly implements the desired \"2-out-of-3\" majority logic, where Therapin is produced if, and only if, at least two of the signals ($S_1, S_2, S_3$) are present.\n\nWhich of the following proposed genetic circuit architectures correctly implements the desired logic for the production of Therapin (P)?\n\nA. The cell contains a single gene for Therapin (P). The promoter of this gene contains binding sites for all three active TFs ($A_1, A_2, A_3$) and is structured such that the binding of *any single* active TF is sufficient to initiate transcription.\n\nB. The cell contains a single gene for Therapin (P). The promoter of this gene is complex and requires the *simultaneous binding* of all three active TFs ($A_1, A_2$, and $A_3$) to create a functional transcriptional complex and initiate expression.\n\nC. The circuit consists of two stages. In the first stage, there are three separate and identical genes, each coding for the same \"Integrator\" protein (I). The first of these genes is controlled by a promoter activated solely by $A_1$. The second is controlled by a promoter activated solely by $A_2$. The third is controlled by a promoter activated solely by $A_3$. In the second stage, a single gene for Therapin (P) is controlled by a promoter that exhibits an ultrasensitive response to the Integrator protein I. This promoter is activated only when the concentration of I exceeds a specific threshold, which is carefully tuned to be higher than the concentration produced by any single active Integrator gene but lower than the total concentration produced when any two of the Integrator genes are active.\n\nD. The circuit is designed using a cascade of repression. The gene for Therapin (P) is constitutively active by default. However, its expression is blocked by three distinct repressor proteins ($R_1, R_2, R_3$), where the presence of any one repressor is sufficient to halt production of P. The expression of these repressors is, in turn, controlled by the active TFs: the gene for $R_1$ is repressed by the combination of active $A_2$ AND $A_3$; the gene for $R_2$ is repressed by active $A_1$ AND $A_3$; and the gene for $R_3$ is repressed by active $A_1$ AND $A_2$.\n\nE. The cell is engineered to contain three distinct gene constructs, each of which can produce Therapin (P). Construct 1 has a promoter that is activated by $A_1$ but repressed by $A_2$. Construct 2 has a promoter that is activated by $A_2$ but repressed by $A_3$. Construct 3 has a promoter that is activated by $A_3$ but repressed by $A_1$.

The resulting logic is\n$$\nP_{A} = A_{1} \\lor A_{2} \\lor A_{3} = S_{1} \\lor S_{2} \\lor S_{3},\n$$\nwhich is true when any single signal is present. This does not match the majority rule because it turns on for exactly one input.\n\nOption B: A single promoter requiring simultaneous binding of all three TFs implements a three-input AND gate. The resulting logic is\n$$\nP_{B} = A_{1} \\land A_{2} \\land A_{3} = S_{1} \\land S_{2} \\land S_{3},\n$$\nwhich is true only when all three signals are present. This fails the majority rule because it is off when exactly two signals are present.\n\nOption C: Three identical integrator genes each produce integrator $I$ under the control of a single TF. Let the contribution from each active integrator gene be $I_{0}$, and zero otherwise. The total integrator level is\n$$\nI = I_{0}(S_{1} + S_{2} + S_{3}).\n$$\nThe second-stage promoter for Therapin is ultrasensitive with a threshold $T$ chosen such that $I_{0} < T < 2 I_{0}$. Define the output rule as $P_{C}=1$ if $I>T$, and $P_{C}=0$ otherwise. Evaluate by the number $k$ of active signals:\n- If $k=0$ or $k=1$, then $I \\leq I_{0} < T$, so $P_{C}=0$.\n- If $k=2$ or $k=3$, then $I \\geq 2 I_{0} > T$, so $P_{C}=1$.\nTherefore $P_{C}$ is true if and only if at least two of $S_{1},S_{2},S_{3}$ are present, which exactly matches the desired majority function.\n\nOption D: Let $R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}$ denote the repressors that each individually block P.
