{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "One of the first and most fundamental decisions in any synthetic biology project is the choice of the host organism, or \"chassis.\" This exercise challenges you to think like a systems biologist, comparing the intrinsic cellular machinery of a simple prokaryote (*E. coli*) with that of a more complex eukaryote (yeast). By considering the requirements for producing a complex therapeutic protein, you will learn to evaluate how an organism's native biological capabilities are a critical design constraint that dictates the feasibility of a project [@problem_id:1469694].", "problem": "A synthetic biology team is designing a system to produce a therapeutic monoclonal antibody for medical applications. This protein is large, complex, and requires specific N-linked glycosylation patterns on its heavy chains to ensure proper folding, stability, and biological function (e.g., binding to target antigens and interacting with the host immune system). The team must choose a suitable microbial host, or \"chassis organism,\" for heterologous expression of this antibody. Two common candidates are the bacterium *Escherichia coli* and the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.\n\nFrom a systems biology perspective, which of the following statements provides the most fundamental and accurate reason for choosing *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* over *Escherichia coli* for this specific task?\n\nA. *Escherichia coli* has a significantly faster cell division time than *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, which leads to a higher rate of errors during protein synthesis and prevents the correct formation of complex proteins like antibodies.\nB. *Escherichia coli* lacks the specialized cellular machinery and compartmentalization, specifically the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, that are required to perform the complex post-translational modifications of glycosylation found in eukaryotes.\nC. The expression plasmids used in *Escherichia coli* are generally of a lower copy number and are less stable than the 2-micron plasmids used in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, making it difficult to achieve the high levels of protein expression needed for antibody production.\nD. The secretion systems in *Escherichia coli* are primarily designed for small signaling molecules, making them incapable of exporting large, folded proteins like antibodies across the cell membranes, whereas yeast secretion pathways are naturally suited for this task.\nE. The codon usage bias of human antibody genes is drastically different from the preferred codons in *Escherichia coli*, leading to translational stalling and truncated proteins, a problem that does not exist in the eukaryotic yeast system.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most fundamental reason why the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* is a better choice than the bacterium *Escherichia coli* for producing a complex, glycosylated protein like a monoclonal antibody. We must evaluate each option based on core principles of cell biology and recombinant protein expression.\n\nThe key requirements for the target protein are its large size, complex structure, and the need for N-linked glycosylation. Glycosylation is a post-translational modification where carbohydrate chains (glycans) are attached to the protein. This process is crucial for the function of many eukaryotic proteins, including antibodies.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n**Option A: Faster cell division leads to errors.**\nWhile *E. coli* does grow faster than yeast, this is generally considered an advantage for industrial production, leading to shorter fermentation times. A high growth rate does not inherently mean a higher error rate in protein synthesis to the point of making it non-viable. The fidelity of ribosomes is highly regulated in all organisms. This is not the primary, fundamental reason for the choice.\n\n**Option B: Lack of cellular machinery for post-translational modifications.**\nThis option points to a core difference between prokaryotes (*E. coli*) and eukaryotes (*S. cerevisiae*). Prokaryotic cells like *E. coli* lack the membrane-bound organelles that characterize eukaryotic cells. Complex post-translational modifications, particularly the N-linked glycosylation pathway required for antibodies, begin in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are further processed and sorted in the Golgi apparatus. Since *E. coli* has neither an ER nor a Golgi, it completely lacks the native machinery to perform these essential modifications. While *E. coli* can be engineered to perform some simple types of glycosylation, it cannot replicate the complex patterns required for mammalian protein function. Yeast, as a eukaryote, possesses both an ER and a Golgi apparatus and has a native glycosylation pathway. Although yeast glycosylation patterns differ from human patterns (e.g., hyper-mannosylation), they provide a functional starting point that can be further engineered (\"humanized\") to mimic the desired structure. This represents a fundamental, qualitative difference in cellular capability.\n\n**Option C: Plasmid copy number and stability.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. *E. coli* is a workhorse for molecular biology precisely because it can support a wide variety of plasmids, including very high-copy-number plasmids (e.g., those with a pUC origin of replication) that are stable and lead to massive protein expression. Low-copy plasmids also exist for tighter control, but the inability to achieve high expression is not a general limitation of the *E. coli* system. Therefore, this is not a valid reason.\n\n**Option D: Inability to secrete large proteins.**\nThis statement is an oversimplification and partially incorrect. While secreting proteins is a challenge in *E. coli*, especially across its two membranes, various secretion systems (Type I, II, III, etc.) exist, and protein secretion has been engineered. For example, proteins can be targeted to the periplasm, or outer membrane vesicles can be used. However, it is true that yeast, as a eukaryote, has a sophisticated secretory pathway (ER-Golgi-vesicles) that is naturally more adept at handling large, folded eukaryotic proteins. But the most critical bottleneck is not secretion itself, but the lack of proper modification *before* secretion. A non-glycosylated antibody would be misfolded and non-functional even if it could be secreted. Hence, the lack of glycosylation machinery (Option B) is a more fundamental problem than the challenges of secretion.\n\n**Option E: Codon usage bias.**\nCodon usage bias is a real and important consideration in heterologous protein expression. If the gene being expressed contains many codons that are rare in the host organism, translation can be slow or terminate prematurely. However, this is a general engineering problem that can be largely solved by synthesizing a new version of the gene with codons \"optimized\" for the host's preferences. Codon optimization is a standard technique used for expression in both *E. coli* and yeast. Therefore, while it is a challenge to be addressed, it is not a fundamental, insurmountable barrier like the complete absence of an entire organelle system.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most fundamental and critical difference that makes yeast a superior chassis for this specific application is its eukaryotic nature. The presence of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus provides the essential, compartmentalized machinery for complex post-translational modifications like N-linked glycosylation, which prokaryotes like *E. coli* completely lack. All other issues, such as secretion or codon bias, are secondary engineering challenges or are based on incorrect premises.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1469694"}, {"introduction": "After selecting a chassis, the next step is to control gene expression effectively. This practice explores the crucial trade-off between resources allocated for cell growth and those for producing a synthetic product—a concept known as metabolic burden.

They are considering two different strategies to control the expression of the biosynthetic pathway. Both strategies are run in batch cultures for a total time $T$.\n\nStrategy A (Constitutive): The pathway genes are placed under the control of a strong constitutive promoter. This promoter is always active, leading to continuous production of the small molecule from the beginning of the culture at $t=0$. However, the high expression level imposes a significant metabolic burden on the host cells, reducing their specific growth rate to a constant value $\\mu_A$.\n\nStrategy B (Inducible): The pathway genes are controlled by a strong inducible promoter. The culture is first grown without the inducer molecule. During this initial phase, there is no metabolic burden, and the cells grow at a higher specific growth rate of $\\mu_B$. At a specific time $T_{ind}$ (where $0 < T_{ind} < T$), the inducer is added to the culture. Upon induction, the promoter becomes fully active, and the metabolic burden on the cells becomes identical to that in Strategy A. Consequently, the specific growth rate of the cells drops to $\\mu_A$ for all subsequent time $t > T_{ind}$.\n\nAssume the following for both strategies:\n- The cultures start with the same initial number of cells, $N_0$.\n- Cell growth is exponential.\n- The rate of small molecule production per cell, denoted by $q_p$, is constant and identical for Strategy A (for all $t$) and for Strategy B after induction (for $t > T_{ind}$).

The circuit's function relies on the periodic accumulation and degradation of a repressor protein, designated RepX.

This relationship is empirically determined to be $\\tau_{osc} = \\gamma \\cdot t_{1/2}$, where $\\gamma$ is a dimensionless circuit-dependent constant.\n\nTo allow for external control, the RepX protein was tagged with a temperature-sensitive degradation domain (a degron). For temperatures $T$ at or below a reference temperature $T_0$, the degron is inactive and the degradation of RepX is negligible.
