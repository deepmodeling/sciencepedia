This first practice exercise places you directly in a common and critical troubleshooting scenario: a complete failure to obtain results. By analyzing a classic cloning experiment with well-designed controls, you will develop the deductive reasoning skills needed to diagnose fundamental errors in molecular construction, a crucial step before you can even begin to test your design [@problem_id:2074894].", "problem": "A synthetic biology student is in the \"Build\" phase of a Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) cycle. The goal is to construct a bacterial biosensor. The design involves inserting a gene for a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which will act as a reporter, into a commercially available plasmid vector named `pEXPR`. The `pEXPR` vector contains a gene `bla` that confers resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin.\n\nThe experimental plan is as follows:\n1.  The `pEXPR` vector backbone is digested with two different restriction enzymes, EcoRI and BamHI, to create a linear piece of DNA with incompatible \"sticky ends\". This strategy is intended to prevent the vector from ligating back to itself.\n2.  The GFP gene is amplified via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using primers that add an EcoRI site to one end and a BamHI site to the other end. This amplified DNA is called the \"insert\".\n3.  The insert is also digested with EcoRI and BamHI.\n4.  The digested vector and insert are mixed together with T4 DNA ligase to create the final circular plasmid.\n5.  The resulting ligation mixture is transformed into a strain of competent *E. coli* cells.\n6.  The cells are plated on a petri dish containing Lysogeny Broth (LB) agar and ampicillin for selection.\n\nThe student also prepares two controls: a \"positive control\" where un-digested `pEXPR` plasmid is transformed and plated on an identical LB-ampicillin plate, and a \"negative control\" where competent cells with no added DNA are plated on another identical LB-ampicillin plate.\n\nAfter overnight incubation, the negative control plate has no colonies, and the positive control plate is covered in colonies, confirming the cells, the plasmid stock, and the selective plates are all functional. However, the experimental plate with the ligation mixture shows zero colonies.\n\nGiven these results, which of the following represents the most direct and likely cause for the complete failure to obtain colonies in the main experiment?\n\nA. The GFP gene insert was accidentally ligated into the vector in the reverse orientation.\n\nB. The heat shock step of the transformation protocol was performed at 37 °C instead of the optimal 42 °C.\n\nC. The T4 DNA ligase enzyme was inadvertently omitted from the ligation reaction mixture.\n\nD. The promoter sequence upstream of the GFP insertion site is specific to eukaryotes and is not recognized by *E. coli* RNA polymerase.\n\nE. A mutation occurred during the PCR amplification of the GFP insert, creating a premature stop codon.", "solution": "We analyze the selection logic and the controls to identify the most direct cause of zero colonies in the experimental plate.\n\nFirst, on LB with ampicillin, only cells that acquire a circular plasmid carrying a functional ampicillin resistance gene (bla) will form colonies. Linear DNA is rapidly degraded in bacteria and does not replicate; hence, it does not confer stable ampicillin resistance.\n\nThe negative control (no DNA) yielding no colonies confirms that the antibiotic selection is effective and there is no contamination. The positive control (undigested pEXPR plasmid) yielding many colonies confirms that the competent cells, transformation workflow, recovery, and plates are functional.\n\nIn the main experiment, the vector was digested with EcoRI and BamHI, producing incompatible sticky ends to prevent self-ligation. The insert was PCR-amplified and digested with the same enzymes to produce matching ends for directional cloning. Successful colony formation therefore requires ligation to re-circularize the vector with the insert.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\nA. Reverse orientation of the insert would still produce a circular plasmid carrying bla. Even if GFP were nonfunctional or improperly expressed, the bla gene on the vector would confer ampicillin resistance, so colonies would still be expected. This cannot explain zero colonies.\n\nB. Performing heat shock at a suboptimal temperature could reduce transformation efficiency. However, the positive control produced many colonies under the same transformation pipeline, indicating that the transformation step was functional. Moreover, a suboptimal heat shock temperature would typically decrease, not abolish, transformants; complete absence of colonies is less directly explained than by a failed ligation.\n\nC. Omitting T4 DNA ligase prevents ligation of the EcoRI- and BamHI-digested vector to the similarly digested insert. Given that the vector ends are incompatible with each other, the vector cannot self-ligate without ligase; the reaction remains as linear DNA fragments. Linear DNA does not confer stable ampicillin resistance and is not maintained in Escherichia coli, so no colonies would be expected. This directly matches the observation and is fully consistent with functional controls.\n\nD. A eukaryotic promoter upstream of GFP would prevent GFP expression in Escherichia coli but does not affect the bla gene; colonies would still form, albeit non-fluorescent. This does not explain zero colonies.\n\nE. A premature stop codon in GFP affects only GFP expression, not bla. Colonies would still form. This does not explain zero colonies.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and likely cause of complete failure to obtain colonies in the main experiment is omission of T4 DNA ligase from the ligation reaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2074894"}, {"introduction": "Often, a first-generation design works, but not perfectly. This exercise moves us from the initial \"Build\" phase into the core iterative loop of \"Test, Learn, and Design.\" Faced with a genetic switch that is \"leaky\"—showing activity when it should be off—you must analyze the underlying cause and propose a targeted modification for the next cycle. This practice illustrates how engineers refine biological systems to achieve precise control, a key skill for creating reliable genetic circuits [@problem_id:1428093].", "problem": "A team of synthetic biology students is in the \"Design-Build-Test-Learn\" cycle for creating a simple genetic switch in *E. coli*. Their goal is to have the bacteria produce a glowing protein only in the presence of a specific sugar.\n\n**Design/Build - Cycle 1:** The team constructed a plasmid containing a single transcriptional unit. This unit consists of an arabinose-inducible promoter (P_BAD) that controls the expression of a gene encoding a highly stable variant of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). In principle, adding the sugar arabinose to the bacterial culture should induce the promoter, leading to GFP production and fluorescence. Removing arabinose should turn off the promoter, stopping GFP production.\n\n**Test - Cycle 1:** The team tested the circuit.\n-   **\"ON\" state:** When arabinose was added to the culture, the bacteria showed strong green fluorescence, as expected.\n-   **\"OFF\" state:** When the bacteria were grown in a medium without arabinose, they still exhibited a significant and easily measurable level of green fluorescence.\n\n**Learn - Cycle 1:** The team concluded that their switch is \"leaky.\" The P_BAD promoter has a low but non-zero level of basal transcription even without arabinose. Because the GFP variant they used is very stable (has a long half-life), this low-level leaky transcription leads to the accumulation of enough GFP protein to cause a noticeable background signal in the \"OFF\" state.\n\nFor the next \"Design/Build\" cycle, the team wants to implement a single, targeted modification to their existing plasmid to make the \"OFF\" state signal much lower (i.e., to create a \"tighter\" switch), while having a minimal negative impact on the maximum possible signal in the \"ON\" state. Which of the following strategies best addresses the specific problem of protein accumulation from a leaky promoter?\n\nA. Replace the gene for the stable GFP with a gene for a different fluorescent protein, such as mCherry (a red fluorescent protein), which is also highly stable.\n\nB. Increase the copy number of the plasmid in the *E. coli* cells.\n\nC. Modify the coding sequence of the *gfp* gene to add a short amino acid sequence to the C-terminus of the GFP protein that acts as a degradation tag, targeting a native *E. coli* protease.\n\nD. Mutate the promoter sequence to increase its binding affinity for the RNA polymerase.", "solution": "The core problem is that a stable protein product (GFP) accumulates to significant levels even when its gene is transcribed at a very low, \"leaky\" rate. The steady-state concentration of a protein is determined by the balance between its synthesis rate and its degradation/dilution rate. To lower the protein level in the \"OFF\" state, we must either decrease the synthesis rate or increase the degradation rate.\n\nLet's analyze the options in the context of the Design-Build-Test-Learn cycle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the root cause.**\nThe problem states that the P_BAD promoter is leaky, leading to basal transcription. This is the source of the synthesis in the \"OFF\" state. The problem is exacerbated by the high stability (low degradation rate) of the GFP protein, which allows it to accumulate. The goal is to reduce the steady-state protein level in the \"OFF\" state.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Option A.**\nThis option suggests replacing GFP with another stable fluorescent protein, mCherry. This only changes the color of the output signal. Since mCherry is also described as highly stable, it would accumulate from the leaky promoter in the same way GFP does. This strategy does not address the fundamental problem of protein accumulation and would likely result in a leaky red switch instead of a leaky green one. Therefore, this is an ineffective solution.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Option B.**\nThis option suggests increasing the plasmid copy number. The rate of gene transcription is proportional to the number of copies of that gene available. Increasing the plasmid copy number would increase the number of *gfp* gene templates in the cell. This would amplify the synthesis rate in both the \"ON\" state and the leaky \"OFF\" state. The background signal in the \"OFF\" state would become even higher, worsening the problem. Therefore, this is a counterproductive solution.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate Option D.**\nThis option suggests mutating the promoter to increase its binding affinity for RNA polymerase. A promoter with a higher affinity for RNA polymerase is a \"stronger\" promoter, meaning it will initiate transcription more frequently. This would increase the transcription rate in both the induced \"ON\" state and the uninduced \"leaky\" state. Similar to option B, this would make the leakiness problem worse, not better. Therefore, this is a counterproductive solution.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate Option C.**\nThis option suggests adding a degradation tag to the GFP protein. A degradation tag is a short peptide sequence that is recognized by cellular proteases, which then actively degrade the protein. This modification directly increases the degradation rate of the GFP protein.\n-   **In the \"OFF\" state:** The synthesis rate is very low due to leaky transcription. A high degradation rate will ensure that any GFP protein that is synthesized is quickly destroyed. This prevents accumulation and leads to a much lower steady-state protein level, resulting in a \"tighter\" OFF state.\n-   **In the \"ON\" state:** The synthesis rate is very high. While the degradation machinery is still active, the high rate of production can overwhelm it, allowing for a high steady-state level of GFP and a strong signal.\nThis strategy directly and effectively targets the identified problem of protein accumulation from a leaky promoter by manipulating the degradation side of the synthesis-degradation balance. It is a standard and powerful technique in synthetic biology to improve the dynamic range and responsiveness of genetic circuits.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAdding a degradation tag (Option C) is the only strategy listed that directly counteracts the accumulation of protein from a leaky promoter, thereby tightening the \"OFF\" state of the genetic switch without eliminating its function.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1428093"}, {"introduction": "Engineering biology often involves introducing entire metabolic pathways, not just single switches. This creates complex interactions with the host cell, leading to system-level challenges like metabolic burden and pathway imbalances. In this advanced practice, you will act as a systems-level detective, integrating diverse data from growth assays, metabolomics, and proteomics to diagnose the poor performance of an engineered yeast strain. This problem highlights how the DBTL cycle is applied to optimize complex biological systems by identifying and resolving bottlenecks [@problem_id:2074916].", "problem": "A synthetic biology team is in the \"Test\" phase of a Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) cycle. Their goal is to engineer the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* to produce violacein, a purple pigment derived from the amino acid L-tryptophan. The engineered pathway consists of three enzymes, VioA, VioB, and VioC, which are expressed from a high-copy plasmid under strong, constitutive promoters. The wild-type yeast strain does not contain this pathway.\n\nAfter constructing the strain, the team conducts a series of experiments comparing their engineered strain to the wild-type strain, both grown in a standard glucose minimal medium. They collect the following key observations:\n\n1.  **Growth Rate:** The engineered yeast strain exhibits a specific growth rate that is 60% lower than that of the wild-type strain.\n2.  **Product Yield:** The final concentration of violacein produced by the engineered strain is substantially lower than the theoretical maximum.\n3.  **Precursor Analysis:** Intracellular metabolite measurements using mass spectrometry show that the concentration of L-tryptophan in the engineered strain is severely depleted, at only 10% of the level found in the wild-type strain under the same conditions.\n4.  **Intermediate Analysis:** The same metabolite analysis reveals a significant intracellular accumulation of pro-violacein, the intermediate produced by the action of enzyme VioA on L-tryptophan.\n5.  **Enzyme Expression:** Proteomic analysis confirms that the VioA enzyme is expressed at a very high level, while the levels of VioB and VioC are detectable but significantly lower than VioA.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following options presents the most plausible hypothesis for the observed poor performance and the most logical immediate next step for the \"Learn-Design\" transition of the DBTL cycle?\n\nA. The final product, violacein, is highly toxic to the yeast cells, causing cell stress and growth inhibition. The next design step should be to add a transporter protein to the plasmid to export violacein out of the cell.\n\nB. The first enzyme in the pathway, VioA, is catalytically inefficient and acts as the primary rate-limiting step. The next design step should be to perform directed evolution on the VioA enzyme to increase its catalytic activity.\n\nC. The precursor L-tryptophan is being diverted so effectively that it starves the cell of this essential amino acid, which is the sole cause of the slow growth. The next design step should be to engineer the upstream metabolic pathways in the yeast to overproduce L-tryptophan.\n\nD. The expression of the pathway enzymes is unbalanced, with an overactive VioA enzyme creating a metabolic bottleneck that depletes the L-tryptophan pool and leads to the accumulation of the intermediate, pro-violacein. The next design step should be to modulate the relative expression levels of the enzymes, for example, by using weaker promoters for VioA or stronger promoters for VioB and VioC.\n\nE. The high expression level of all three foreign proteins (VioA, VioB, VioC) places a severe general resource burden on the cell (e.g., draining ATP and amino acid pools for translation), which nonspecifically slows growth. The next design step should be to switch to inducible promoters for all three enzymes so they are only expressed late in the growth phase.", "solution": "We model the engineered pathway as a linear sequence converting L-tryptophan to violacein via an intermediate:\n$$ \\text{L-tryptophan} \\xrightarrow{\\text{VioA}} \\text{pro-violacein} \\xrightarrow{\\text{VioB}} \\text{intermediate} \\xrightarrow{\\text{VioC}} \\text{violacein} $$\nLet the step fluxes be $v_{A}$, $v_{B}$, and $v_{C}$ for VioA, VioB, and VioC, respectively.\n\nFrom intracellular measurements:\n- L-tryptophan in the engineered strain is $0.10$ of wild-type, indicating strong consumption by the pathway relative to native synthesis/uptake. A mass balance on intracellular tryptophan can be written schematically as\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\text{Trp}]}{dt} = r_{\\text{syn}} + r_{\\text{uptake}} - r_{\\text{native\\ use}} - v_{A}.\n$$\nA severe depletion of $[\\text{Trp}]$ implies $v_{A}$ is large relative to the combined supply and native use terms under these conditions.\n- Pro-violacein accumulates significantly. A mass balance on pro-violacein gives\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\text{ProV}]}{dt} = v_{A} - v_{B}.\n$$\nMeasured accumulation implies $v_{A} > v_{B}$ over relevant time scales. If $v_{C}$ is also relatively low, then downstream conversion is additionally limiting, further favoring intermediate buildup.\n\nProduct formation rate in a linear pathway is constrained by the slowest effective step, so the overall flux to violacein is approximately limited by the smallest of $\\{v_{A}, v_{B}, v_{C}\\}$. The observations of low final violacein, high pro-violacein, and severe tryptophan depletion together imply $v_{A} \\gg v_{B}, v_{C}$, i.e., an expression/kinetic imbalance where the first step pulls substrate strongly, depleting L-tryptophan and overproducing the first intermediate, while downstream steps are comparatively underpowered.\n\nThis mechanistic picture also explains the observed growth defect. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid required for protein synthesis; depleted $[\\text{Trp}]$ reduces translational capacity and thus specific growth rate. The growth reduction of $0.60$ relative to wild type is therefore consistent with excessive diversion of tryptophan into an intermediate that cannot be efficiently processed further.\n\nNow evaluate the options against these mechanistic constraints:\n- Option A (product toxicity) would predict issues correlating with high violacein levels. However, violacein is low, while the intermediate is high and tryptophan is depleted. This contradicts a primary role for product toxicity.\n- Option B (VioA is the rate-limiting step) is inconsistent with observed pro-violacein accumulation and tryptophan depletion. If VioA were slow, $v_{A}$ would be small, $[\\text{ProV}]$ would not accumulate, and $[\\text{Trp}]$ would not be severely depleted.\n- Option C (insufficient tryptophan supply upstream) acknowledges the tryptophan depletion but misattributes the root cause. The data indicate that the depletion is driven by an overactive first step relative to downstream steps. Simply increasing tryptophan supply without correcting the imbalance would likely exacerbate intermediate accumulation and may not improve final product flux.\n- Option D (unbalanced expression with overactive VioA causing a bottleneck and intermediate buildup) matches all observations: $v_{A} \\gg v_{B}, v_{C}$ explains tryptophan depletion, pro-violacein accumulation, low final violacein, and growth inhibition. The most direct next step in the Learn-Design transition is to rebalance enzyme expression to align $v_{A}$ with $v_{B}$ and $v_{C}$ (e.g., decreasing VioA expression and/or increasing VioB and VioC expression).\n- Option E (general resource burden) would cause nonspecific stress but does not specifically predict severe tryptophan depletion with selective accumulation of a particular intermediate. The targeted metabolite patterns argue for a pathway-specific imbalance rather than a purely global burden.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible hypothesis and the most logical immediate next step is given by Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2074916"}]}
