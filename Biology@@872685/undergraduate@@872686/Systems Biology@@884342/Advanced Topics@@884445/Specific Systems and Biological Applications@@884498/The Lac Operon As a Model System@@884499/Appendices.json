{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To truly understand a gene circuit like the lac operon, we must distinguish between its different types of components. Some elements, like the operator ($O$), are fixed DNA sequences that act locally—they are *cis-acting*. Others, like the repressor protein ($I$), are diffusible molecules that can act anywhere in the cell—they are *trans-acting*. This exercise challenges you to apply these fundamental concepts by predicting the phenotype of a partial diploid cell, a classic genetic scenario designed to disentangle the roles of cis- and trans-acting elements in gene regulation [@problem_id:1473290].", "problem": "A bioengineering student is designing a synthetic gene circuit in *Escherichia coli* to control the production of an enzyme. The student creates a partial diploid strain of *E. coli* using an F' plasmid. The genotype of the bacterial chromosome is $I^+ O^+ Z^-$, while the genotype of the F' plasmid is $I^- O^+ Z^+$.\n\nThe components of this system are defined as follows:\n- The lacI gene ($I$) codes for a repressor protein. The allele $I^+$ produces a functional repressor, while $I^-$ produces a non-functional repressor.\n- The operator ($O$) is a segment of DNA to which the repressor protein binds. The allele $O^+$ is a normal operator site.\n- The lacZ gene ($Z$) codes for the enzyme β-galactosidase. The allele $Z^+$ produces functional β-galactosidase, while $Z^-$ produces a non-functional version of the enzyme.\n\nThe repressor protein binds to the operator to block transcription. Lactose (or its metabolite, allolactose) can bind to the functional repressor protein, causing a conformational change that prevents the repressor from binding to the operator.\n\nBased on this genetic arrangement, which of the following statements correctly describes the production of functional β-galactosidase in this partial diploid cell?\n\nA. Functional β-galactosidase is synthesized, and this synthesis is inducible by lactose.\nB. Functional β-galactosidase is synthesized, but its synthesis is constitutive (occurs regardless of the presence of lactose).\nC. No functional β-galactosidase is synthesized under any condition.\nD. No functional β-galactosidase is synthesized because the functional repressor protein produced from the $I^+$ allele can only act on the adjacent $Z^−$ gene on the chromosome.\nE. Functional β-galactosidase is synthesized, but only in the absence of lactose.", "solution": "The chromosomal genotype is $I^{+} O^{+} Z^{-}$ and the F' plasmid genotype is $I^{-} O^{+} Z^{+}$. The molecular logic of the lac system required here is as follows: the product of $I$ (the LacI repressor) is a trans-acting diffusible protein; the operator $O$ is a cis-acting DNA site; a functional repressor (from $I^{+}$) binds to an $O^{+}$ operator to block transcription; lactose (or allolactose) binds a functional repressor to prevent its operator binding and thereby induces transcription. The $Z^{+}$ allele produces functional beta-galactosidase when transcribed, whereas $Z^{-}$ cannot produce functional enzyme.\n\nFrom $I^{+} O^{+} Z^{-}$ on the chromosome, a functional LacI repressor is produced. Because LacI is trans-acting, the repressor diffuses and can bind to any $O^{+}$ operator in the cell, including both the chromosomal $O^{+}$ and the plasmid $O^{+}$. The plasmid $I^{-}$ produces no functional repressor and does not interfere (there is no dominant negative specified). Therefore, in the absence of lactose, the functional repressor from $I^{+}$ binds both $O^{+}$ sites and blocks transcription from both operons. Under these conditions, the chromosomal $Z^{-}$ cannot produce functional enzyme regardless, and the plasmid $Z^{+}$ is repressed, so no functional beta-galactosidase is synthesized.\n\nIn the presence of lactose (or allolactose), the inducer binds the functional LacI repressor and prevents its binding to $O^{+}$. With the operators unoccupied, transcription proceeds from both operons. The chromosomal $Z^{-}$ still cannot produce functional enzyme, but the plasmid $Z^{+}$ is transcribed and translated into functional beta-galactosidase. Thus, functional enzyme is synthesized only when lactose is present, i.e., synthesis is inducible.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that functional β-galactosidase is synthesized, and this synthesis is inducible by lactose. This matches option A and rules out: B (would require $O^{c}$ or no functional $I$), C (contradicted by inducible expression from $Z^{+}$ on the plasmid), D (incorrectly asserts the repressor acts only in cis), and E (inverted regulation).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1473290"}, {"introduction": "Biological systems are constantly adapting to their environment, and their responses are not always instantaneous. The lac operon provides a perfect example of layered regulation, where *E. coli* prioritizes a preferred sugar, glucose, over others like lactose through a mechanism called catabolite repression. This practice asks you to think like a systems biologist by considering the dynamics of the system, predicting how the concentration of an enzyme changes over time when the environment shifts suddenly [@problem_id:1473275]. It will help you appreciate that system behavior is governed by the rates of production, degradation, and dilution.", "problem": "A bacterial culture of *E. coli* is grown in a chemostat under conditions where lactose is the sole carbon and energy source. The culture has reached a steady state, meaning the lac operon is actively transcribed and the intracellular concentration of β-galactosidase, the enzyme that metabolizes lactose, is at a high, stable level.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the medium is abruptly changed. The new medium contains the same concentration of lactose as before, but now also includes a high concentration of glucose. Assuming the bacterial culture continues to grow and divide, which of the following statements best describes the expected behavior of the average intracellular concentration of β-galactosidase for time $t > 0$?\n\nA. The concentration of β-galactosidase immediately drops to nearly zero because its synthesis is instantly and completely halted.\nB. The concentration of β-galactosidase continues to increase, as lactose is still present to act as an inducer.\nC. The concentration of β-galactosidase remains constant at its initial high level, as the pre-existing lactose continues to induce the operon.\nD. The concentration of β-galactosidase gradually decreases over time, as new synthesis of the enzyme is repressed and existing enzyme molecules are diluted through cell division and eventually degraded.\nE. The concentration of β-galactosidase first drops sharply, then rises back to its original high level as the bacteria adapt to the new medium.", "solution": "Define $B(t)$ as the average intracellular concentration of beta-galactosidase per cell. Its time evolution can be modeled by a mass-balance that accounts for synthesis, dilution by growth, and intrinsic degradation:\n$$\n\\frac{dB}{dt} = s(t) - \\mu B(t) - \\delta B(t),\n$$\nwhere $s(t)$ is the synthesis rate per cell volume (or per cell), $\\mu$ is the specific growth rate (causing dilution of intracellular concentration through cell division), and $\\delta$ is the first-order degradation rate constant for the enzyme.\n\nBefore the shift (for $t0$), the culture is at steady state on lactose with the lac operon induced, so\n$$\n\\frac{dB}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 0 = s_{\\text{lac}} - (\\mu + \\delta) B_{\\text{ss}},\n$$\nwhich gives\n$$\nB_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{s_{\\text{lac}}}{\\mu + \\delta}.\n$$\n\nAt $t=0$, glucose is introduced at high concentration while lactose remains present. Two regulatory mechanisms occur: catabolite repression (glucose lowers intracellular cyclic AMP, reducing CRP–cAMP activation of lac transcription) and inducer exclusion (glucose transport via the phosphotransferase system prevents efficient lactose uptake and allolactose formation). Together, these sharply repress new lac transcription, so for $t>0$ the synthesis rate drops to a much lower value $s_{\\text{glc}}$ with $0 \\leq s_{\\text{glc}} \\ll s_{\\text{lac}}$. The governing equation becomes\n$$\n\\frac{dB}{dt} = s_{\\text{glc}} - (\\mu + \\delta) B(t).\n$$\n\nThis linear ODE has the solution (with $B(0)=B_{\\text{ss}}$ from before the shift)\n$$\nB(t) = B(0)\\,\\exp\\!\\big(-(\\mu+\\delta)t\\big) + \\frac{s_{\\text{glc}}}{\\mu+\\delta}\\left[1 - \\exp\\!\\big(-(\\mu+\\delta)t\\big)\\right].\n$$\nBecause $s_{\\text{glc}} \\ll s_{\\text{lac}}$, the post-shift steady state $B_{\\infty} = \\frac{s_{\\text{glc}}}{\\mu+\\delta}$ is much lower than $B(0)=\\frac{s_{\\text{lac}}}{\\mu+\\delta}$. In the limiting case of strong repression, $s_{\\text{glc}} \\approx 0$, the solution reduces to\n$$\nB(t) = B(0)\\,\\exp\\!\\big(-(\\mu+\\delta)t\\big),\n$$\nwhich decays gradually with time constant $(\\mu+\\delta)^{-1}$. Thus, there is no instantaneous drop to zero (existing enzyme persists), no continued increase (new synthesis is repressed), and no constancy (dilution and degradation reduce $B(t)$). A rebound to the original high level would require relief of repression (e.g., glucose depletion), which does not occur under continued high glucose supply.\n\nTherefore, the average intracellular concentration of beta-galactosidase decreases gradually over time due to halted or strongly reduced synthesis combined with dilution by growth and eventual degradation, matching option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1473275"}, {"introduction": "A central goal of systems biology is to translate our qualitative understanding of biological processes into quantitative, predictive models. Even complex phenomena like gene regulation can often be captured by mathematical frameworks, such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs), that balance the rates of production and removal of molecules like mRNA.
