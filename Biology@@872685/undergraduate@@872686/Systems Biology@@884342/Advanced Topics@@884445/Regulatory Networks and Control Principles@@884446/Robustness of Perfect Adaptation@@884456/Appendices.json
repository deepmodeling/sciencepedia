The pathway consists of three molecular species, whose concentrations are denoted by $[X]$, $[Y]$, and $[Z]$. The system is driven by an external, constant input signal of magnitude $S$.\n\nThe dynamics of this network are described by the following set of coupled ordinary differential equations:\n\n1.  The concentration of an intermediate molecule, $[X]$, is increased by the signal $S$ and decreased by a controller molecule $Z$. The rate of change of $[X]$ is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{d[X]}{dt} = k_1 S - k_2 [Z] $$\n\n2.  The intermediate molecule $X$ promotes the production of the output molecule $Y$, which undergoes first-order degradation. The rate of change of $[Y]$ is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{d[Y]}{dt} = k_3 [X] - k_4 [Y] $$\n\n3.  The controller molecule $Z$ is part of a feedback loop.

The total concentration of this protein in the cell is $Y_{tot} = Y + Y_p$.\n\nThe dynamics of the phosphorylation cycle are modeled by the following simplified kinetic rules:\n1.  The phosphorylation of $Y$ to $Y_p$ is catalyzed by a kinase whose activity is dependent on an external stimulus, $S$. The rate of this reaction is given by $v_{phos} = k_{phos} S [Y]$, where $k_{phos}$ is a rate constant and $[Y]$ is the concentration of the unphosphorylated protein.\n2.  The dephosphorylation of $Y_p$ back to $Y$ is carried out by a constitutively active phosphatase. The rate of this reaction is given by $v_{dephos} = k_{dephos} [Y_p]$, where $k_{dephos}$ is a rate constant and $[Y_p]$ is the concentration of the phosphorylated protein.\n\nA key experimental observation for this system is that it exhibits perfect adaptation with respect to the concentration of the active protein, $[Y_p]$. This means that for any sustained step-increase in the stimulus from an initial value of $S=0$ to a new constant value $S0$, the system eventually reaches a new steady state where the concentration of $[Y_p]$ is always the same non-zero value, which we denote as $Y_{p,ref}$.\n\nWhile the concentration of the active form $[Y_p]$ is robust to the magnitude of the stimulus (for $S0$), it is not clear if the same is true for the total amount of protein $Y$ that the cell must maintain. To investigate this, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the steady-state total protein concentration, $[Y_{tot}]_{ss}$, as a function of the stimulus level $S$ and the system parameters $k_{phos}$, $k_{dephos}$, and $Y_{p,ref}$.", "solution": "We model the phosphorylation cycle with the mass-action rates $v_{phos} = k_{phos} S [Y]$ and $v_{dephos} = k_{dephos} [Y_{p}]$.

The active regulator, $R_p$, is produced by a sensor kinase whose activity is directly proportional to the ligand concentration $L$. This production rate is given by $k_1 L$, where $k_1$ is a rate constant.\n2.  A phosphatase, $P$, whose concentration is denoted by $p$, deactivates $R_p$. This deactivation process follows the rate law $k_2 p y$, where $k_2$ is a rate constant.\n3.  The synthesis of the phosphatase $P$ is stimulated by the active regulator $R_p$. The rate of synthesis is $k_3 y$, where $k_3$ is a rate constant.\n4.  The phosphatase $P$ is removed from the system at a constant rate $k_4$, in a process that is independent of any other species (a zero-order removal).\n\nInitially, the system is at a steady state with a constant ligand concentration of $L_0$.
