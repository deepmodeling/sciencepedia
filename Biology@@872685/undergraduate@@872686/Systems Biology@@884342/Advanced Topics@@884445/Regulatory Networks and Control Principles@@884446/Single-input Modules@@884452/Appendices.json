The product of two positive, decreasing functions is also a decreasing function. Therefore, the maximum value of their product, $n_{app}$, must occur at the start of the interval, i.e., as $[X_2] \\to 0$.\nThe maximum value is the limit of $n_{app}$ as $[X_2] \\to 0$:\n$$n_{app, max} = \\lim_{[X_2] \\to 0} n_{app}([X_2]) = \\left(\\lim_{[X_2] \\to 0} n_{gene}([X_2])\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\lim_{[X_2] \\to 0} n_{dimer}([X_2])\\right)$$\n$$n_{app, max} = (h) \\cdot (2) = 2h$$\nThe maximum possible value for the apparent Hill coefficient is $2h$.
