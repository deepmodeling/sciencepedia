This first exercise translates this biological concept into the clear and unambiguous language of logic. By determining the logical operation that describes the interaction of an activator and a repressor, you will practice the fundamental skill of abstracting a regulatory mechanism into a simple, predictive model [@problem_id:1427524].", "problem": "In a synthetic biology project, a bacterial gene responsible for producing a blue pigment is placed under the control of a synthetic promoter. This promoter's activity is regulated by two distinct Transcription Factors (TFs), TF-X and TF-Y, whose presence or absence can be controlled by the researchers. The regulatory logic is as follows:\n\n1.  **TF-X** is an **activator**. For the transcription of the pigment gene to begin, TF-X must be present and bound to its specific operator site on the promoter. In the absence of TF-X, the gene is silent.\n2.  **TF-Y** is a **repressor**. When TF-Y is present, it binds to a different operator site on the same promoter. This binding event physically obstructs the transcriptional machinery, preventing gene expression entirely, even if the activator TF-X is also present and bound.\n\nLet's represent the presence of a TF with the logical value `TRUE` (or `1`) and its absence with `FALSE` (or `0`). Similarly, let the expression of the blue pigment gene be represented by an output that is `TRUE` (`1`) when the pigment is produced (cell is blue) and `FALSE` (`0`) when it is not (cell is colorless).\n\nBased on this information, which of the following logical operations best describes the output (pigment production) as a function of the inputs (presence of TF-X and TF-Y)?\n\nA.

Let the output be $O$, where $O=1$ indicates pigment expression and $O=0$ indicates no expression.\n\nBy the problem statement:\n- TF-X is required for activation. Thus, if $X=0$, the gene is silent regardless of $Y$, so $O=0$ whenever $X=0$.\n- TF-Y is a repressor that blocks expression even if TF-X is present. Thus, if $Y=1$, the gene is silent regardless of $X$, so $O=0$ whenever $Y=1$.\n\nCombining these conditions, the only case that yields expression is when $X=1$ and $Y=0$.

A TF is a protein that binds to specific DNA sequences, thereby controlling the rate of transcription of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA.

The response to the first stress is primarily controlled by TF `A`, while the response to the second stress is controlled by TF `B`.\n- The regulon for TF `A` consists of 50 genes.\n- The regulon for TF `B` consists of 40 genes.\n- A detailed analysis reveals that 20 genes are common to both regulons, meaning they are co-regulated by both TF `A` and TF `B`.\n\nA common metric to quantify the similarity between these two regulons is the ratio of the size of their intersection (the number of co-regulated genes) to the size of their union (the total number of unique genes regulated by TF `A`, or TF `B`, or both).\n\nCalculate this similarity metric for the regulons of TF `A` and TF `B`.

This process, known as squelching, is reversible and governed by the equilibrium reaction $A + B \\rightleftharpoons C$, with a dissociation constant $K_S$.\n\nThe cell also contains a gene, $Z$, whose expression is regulated solely by the repressor $B$. The repressor binds to the promoter region of gene $Z$, denoted $P_Z$, according to the reversible reaction $P_Z + B \\rightleftharpoons P_Z B$, with a dissociation constant $K_R$.
