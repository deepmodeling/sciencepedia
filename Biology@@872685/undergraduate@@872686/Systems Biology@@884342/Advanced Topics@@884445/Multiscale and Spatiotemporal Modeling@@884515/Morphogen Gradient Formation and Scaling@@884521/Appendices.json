This practice ([@problem_id:1449497]) presents a thought experiment where a steady-state reaction-diffusion gradient is perturbed by suddenly halting all degradation, mimicking the effect of a powerful drug. By comparing the total amount of morphogen before and after this change, you will gain a quantitative appreciation for how degradation shapes the gradient's profile and controls the overall morphogen level in a tissue.", "problem": "Consider a simplified model of morphogen gradient formation in a one-dimensional tissue, represented as a line of cells of length $L$. A specialized group of cells at one end of the tissue, located at position $x=0$, acts as a source, maintaining a constant morphogen concentration $C_0$. From this source, the morphogen molecule diffuses along the tissue with an effective diffusion coefficient $D$ and is actively degraded by all cells with a first-order rate constant $k$. The far end of the tissue, at position $x=L$, is a sealed, no-flux boundary, meaning no morphogen can pass through it. The system is allowed to run for a long time until it reaches a steady state, establishing an initial concentration profile.\n\nAt a specific moment, which we define as time $t=0$, an experimental drug is uniformly applied to the entire tissue. This drug instantly and completely inhibits the morphogen degradation process, effectively setting the degradation rate constant $k$ to zero. The source at $x=0$ and the sealed boundary at $x=L$ remain unaffected by the drug. The system is then allowed to evolve until it reaches a new, final steady state.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the total amount of morphogen in the tissue at the new, final steady state to the total amount of morphogen that was present in the initial steady state.
