The process begins when planktonic (free-floating) bacteria from the surrounding environment attach to the surface.

The proportionality constant for detachment is given by $k$ (per unit time).\n\nAssuming the surface is initially sterile at time $t=0$, derive an expression for the number of attached bacterial cells, $N(t)$, on the surface as a function of time.
