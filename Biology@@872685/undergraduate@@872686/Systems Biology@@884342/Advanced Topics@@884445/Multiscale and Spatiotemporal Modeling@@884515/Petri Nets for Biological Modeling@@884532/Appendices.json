The model represents a pre-messenger Ribonucleic Acid (pre-mRNA) molecule being processed into one of two different final mRNA products, Product A or Product B, by the selective inclusion or exclusion of a single exon.\n\nThe Petri net is defined by a set of places and a set of transitions:\n\nThe places represent the different molecular species in the system:\n- `P1`: The pool of available pre-mRNA molecules.\n- `P2`: The pool of available Splicing Factor 1 (SF1), an enzyme that catalyzes the inclusion of the exon.\n- `P3`: The pool of available Splicing Factor 2 (SF2), an enzyme that catalyzes the exclusion of the exon.\n- `P4`: The pool of final mRNA Product A (exon included).\n- `P5`: The pool of final mRNA Product B (exon excluded).\n\nThe transitions represent the possible biochemical reactions:\n- `T1`: This reaction represents the splicing process that produces Product A. For this reaction to occur, it requires one molecule of pre-mRNA (from `P1`) and one molecule of SF1 (from `P2`).

In this formalism, molecular species are represented as 'places', and the reactions that transform them are represented as 'transitions'. The state of the system is given by the number of molecules (tokens) in each place. A transition 'fires' by consuming tokens from its input places and producing tokens in its output places, thereby modeling a chemical reaction.\n\nConsider the process of competitive enzyme inhibition, a fundamental mechanism of metabolic regulation. The process is described as follows:\n1.  An enzyme (E) reversibly binds to its substrate (S) at its active site to form an enzyme-substrate complex (ES).\n2.  The enzyme-substrate complex (ES) can then undergo a catalytic step to release the original enzyme (E) and a product (P).\n3.  A competitive inhibitor molecule (I) is present. It is structurally similar to the substrate and can reversibly bind to the *same* active site on the free enzyme (E), forming an enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI).\n4.  The enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI) is catalytically inactive and cannot form a product.\n5.

For each phosphorylation step (e.g., `S0` to `S1`, `S1` to `S2`, etc.), the kinase must bind to the substrate, catalyze the addition of one phosphate group, and then dissociate from the product. To add the next phosphate group, a free kinase molecule must bind again to the new substrate form.\n\n2.  **Processive Model**: In this mechanism, the kinase binds once to the unphosphorylated substrate `S0`, performs all four phosphorylation steps sequentially without dissociating from the substrate, and only releases the final, fully phosphorylated product `S4`.\n\nFor constructing the Petri net models, adhere to the following rules:\n-   Each unique chemical species (e.g., `Kin`, `S0`, `Kin-S0` complex) is represented by a unique **place**.\n-   Each elementary reaction step (e.g., binding, dissociation, catalysis) is represented by a unique **transition**.\n-   In both models, the initial binding of the enzyme to a substrate is a reversible reaction.\n-   All catalytic phosphorylation steps are considered irreversible.\n-   In the distributive model, the binding of the kinase to each intermediate substrate (`S0`, `S1`, `S2`, `S3`) is a reversible process.\n-   In the processive model, only the initial binding of the kinase to `S0` is reversible; the subsequent internal phosphorylation steps happen while the complex is maintained and are irreversible.\n\nCalculate the difference, $C_{dist} - C_{proc}$, where $C_{dist}$ is the total number of components (places plus transitions) required for the distributive model, and $C_{proc}$ is the total number of components required for the processive model.", "solution": "We count the components for each model based on the rules provided: each unique chemical species is a place, and each elementary reaction step is a transition.\n\n**1.
