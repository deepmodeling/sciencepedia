The prospective father is known to be heterozygous for the causative allele, while the prospective mother is homozygous for the recessive, non-pathogenic allele.\n\nThe PGT test is not infallible. Its diagnostic accuracy is described as follows:\n- **Sensitivity**: The test has a sensitivity of 99.0%. This represents the probability that an embryo with the genetic disorder will test positive (i.e., be diagnosed as 'affected').\n- **Specificity**: The test has a specificity of 98.0%.

This requires us to first determine the Mendelian probabilities of an embryo being genetically affected or unaffected, and then use the law of total probability in conjunction with the given test sensitivity and specificity.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the prior probabilities from Mendelian genetics.**\nLet $A$ be the dominant allele that causes the disorder and $a$ be the recessive, non-pathogenic allele.\nThe father is heterozygous, so his genotype is $Aa$.\nThe mother is homozygous recessive, so her genotype is $aa$.\n\nWe can construct a Punnett square for the cross $Aa \\times aa$:\n| | a | a |\n| :---: | :-: | :-: |\n| **A** | Aa | Aa |\n| **a** | aa | aa |\n\nFrom the Punnett square, the possible genotypes for an embryo are $Aa$ and $aa$.\nThe probability of an embryo having the genotype $Aa$ (and thus being genetically affected by the dominant disorder) is $\\frac{2}{4} = 0.5$.\nThe probability of an embryo having the genotype $aa$ (and thus being genetically unaffected) is $\\frac{2}{4} = 0.5$.\n\nLet's define the following events:\n- $D$: The event that the embryo is genetically affected (genotype $Aa$).\n- $U$: The event that the embryo is genetically unaffected (genotype $aa$).\n\nFrom our analysis, the prior probabilities are:\n$P(D) = 0.5$\n$P(U) = 0.5$\n\n**Step 2: Define the diagnostic test events and conditional probabilities.**\nLet's define the events related to the PGT test outcome:\n- $T_{pos}$: The event that the embryo tests positive (diagnosed as 'affected').\n- $T_{neg}$: The event that the embryo tests negative (diagnosed as 'unaffected').\n\nThe problem provides the sensitivity and specificity of the test, which are conditional probabilities:\n- Sensitivity is the probability of testing positive given the embryo is affected: $P(T_{pos} | D) = 0.99$.\n- Specificity is the probability of testing negative given the embryo is unaffected: $P(T_{neg} | U) = 0.98$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Law of Total Probability.**\nWe want to find the overall probability that an embryo is diagnosed as 'unaffected', which is $P(T_{neg})$. We can calculate this using the law of total probability, which states that the total probability of an event is the sum of its probabilities conditioned on all possible mutually exclusive scenarios (in this case, an embryo being genetically affected or unaffected).\n\n$$P(T_{neg}) = P(T_{neg} | D) \\cdot P(D) + P(T_{neg} | U) \\cdot P(U)$$\n\nWe know $P(D)$, $P(U)$, and $P(T_{neg} | U)$. We still need to find $P(T_{neg} | D)$, which is the probability of a false negative (the embryo is affected but tests negative).\n\nFor any given condition (like being affected, $D$), the test can only be positive or negative. Therefore:\n$$P(T_{pos} | D) + P(T_{neg} | D) = 1$$\n\nWe can solve for the false negative rate:\n$$P(T_{neg} | D) = 1 - P(T_{pos} | D) = 1 - (\\text{Sensitivity})$$\n$$P(T_{neg} | D) = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final probability.**\nNow we can substitute all the known values into the law of total probability equation:\n\n$$P(T_{neg}) = P(T_{neg} | D) \\cdot P(D) + P(T_{neg} | U) \\cdot P(U)$$\n$$P(T_{neg}) = (0.01) \\cdot (0.5) + (0.98) \\cdot (0.5)$$\n$$P(T_{neg}) = 0.005 + 0.490$$\n$$P(T_{neg}) = 0.495$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.495$ already has three significant figures (4, 9, 5).\n\nThus, the total probability that an embryo will be diagnosed as 'unaffected' is 0.495.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.495}$$", "id": "1708991"}, {"introduction": "Genetic screening often involves assessing risks for multiple conditions simultaneously, each with a unique inheritance pattern.
