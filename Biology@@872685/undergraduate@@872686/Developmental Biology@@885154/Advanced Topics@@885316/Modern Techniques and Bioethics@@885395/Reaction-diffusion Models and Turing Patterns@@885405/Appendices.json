Consider a simplified one-dimensional system of two identical, adjacent biological cells, Cell 1 and Cell 2. The state of each cell is determined by the concentrations of two signaling molecules: an \"activator\" and an \"inhibitor\". The system follows these rules:\n\n1.  The activator promotes its own production (auto-activation) and also promotes the production of the inhibitor.\n2.  The inhibitor suppresses the production of the activator.\n3.  The activator diffuses very slowly between adjacent cells.\n4.  The inhibitor diffuses very rapidly between adjacent cells.\n\nInitially, both cells are in a stable state with identical low concentrations of both the activator and the inhibitor.
