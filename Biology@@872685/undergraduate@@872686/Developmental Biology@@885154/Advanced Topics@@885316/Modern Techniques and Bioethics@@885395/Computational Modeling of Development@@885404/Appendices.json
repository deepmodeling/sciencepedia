Consider one such model involving a regulatory circuit of three genes: Gene Alpha, Gene Beta, and Gene Gamma. The expression of these genes is controlled by a negative feedback loop: the protein product of Gene Alpha represses the expression of Gene Beta; the protein product of Gene Beta represses Gene Gamma; and the protein product of Gene Gamma represses Gene Alpha.\n\nWe can model the state of this network using a simple binary system where a gene is either 'ON' (represented by 1) or 'OFF' (represented by 0). The state of the entire network at any given time step $t$ can be written as an ordered triplet (State of Alpha, State of Beta, State of Gamma). The network updates its state in discrete, synchronous time steps. The rule for the update is as follows: a gene will be 'ON' in the next time step ($t+1$) if and only if its specific repressor gene was 'OFF' in the current time step ($t$). Otherwise, it will be 'OFF'.\n\nIf the network is in the initial state (1, 0, 0) at time step $t=0$, what is the sequence of states for the network at time steps $t=1$, $t=2$, and $t=3$?\n\nA.

The Differential Adhesion Hypothesis (DAH) provides a powerful physical explanation for this self-organization, proposing that cells rearrange to minimize interfacial energy, much like immiscible fluids. In this exercise, you will apply the core principles of the DAH to predict the final, stable configuration of two intermixed cell populations. This will help you build intuition for how microscopic adhesion properties translate into macroscopic tissue architecture. [@problem_id:1676839]", "problem": "In a computational simulation based on the Cellular Potts Model (CPM), a virtual culture is initiated with a randomly intermixed population of two distinct cell types, labeled type A and type B. The simulation models cell sorting behavior by iteratively adjusting cell boundaries to minimize the total interfacial energy of the system. This energy is governed by the adhesion strength between neighboring cells. The simulation defines a specific energy penalty, $J$, for each type of cell-cell contact. A lower $J$ value corresponds to a stronger, more energetically favorable adhesion.\n\nThe specific energy parameters for this system are set according to the following relationship:\n$$J_{AA}  J_{BB}  J_{AB}$$\nwhere $J_{AA}$ is the energy penalty for a contact between two type A cells, $J_{BB}$ is for a contact between two type B cells, and $J_{AB}$ is for a contact between a type A and a type B cell.\n\nAssuming the system is allowed to run until it reaches a stable, minimum-energy equilibrium state, which of the following descriptions accurately portrays the final spatial arrangement of the cells?\n\nA. The type A cells will form a single cohesive mass at the center, which is fully engulfed by the type B cells.\n\nB.

The two cell types will completely separate from each other, forming two distinct and adjacent spherical aggregates.\n\nE. The cells will arrange themselves into a stable, alternating checkerboard-like pattern.", "solution": "The Cellular Potts Model assigns an interfacial energy penalty $J_{\\alpha\\beta}$ to every contact between neighboring cells of types $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, and the total energy is reduced by Monte Carlo updates that minimize the sum of these penalties over all interfaces. A lower $J_{\\alpha\\beta}$ corresponds to stronger adhesion and therefore a more energetically favorable contact. The system evolves to minimize the total interfacial energy, so the equilibrium configuration is determined by how to arrange cells to reduce high-penalty contacts and, subject to that, to arrange domains so that the more cohesive tissue adopts the position that further lowers the total boundary energy.\n\nGiven\n$$\nJ_{AA}  J_{BB}  J_{AB},\n$$\nwe have the following implications:\n1. Because $J_{AB}$ is the largest, heterotypic A–B contacts carry the highest energy cost. Therefore, energy minimization drives a reduction of the total A–B interfacial area. This implies demixing (cell sorting), not maintenance of a random mixture; hence option C is incompatible with minimizing $J_{AB}$-weighted interfaces. Likewise, a checkerboard-like alternation (option E) would maximize the number of A–B contacts and is therefore energetically unfavorable when $J_{AB}$ is largest.\n\n2. Among homotypic contacts, $J_{AA}  J_{BB}$ means A–A adhesion is stronger (more favorable) than B–B. In the differential adhesion framework, each cell type behaves as a cohesive fluid with an effective tissue cohesivity (or surface tension analog) that increases with the strength of homotypic adhesion. Thus type A is more cohesive than type B.\n\n3. When two cohesivities differ and heterotypic contacts are unfavorable, the minimal-energy arrangement after demixing places the more cohesive tissue inside, fully surrounded by the less cohesive tissue. This configuration minimizes total interfacial energy by:\n   - Eliminating unnecessary A–B contacts (demixing);\n   - Positioning the more cohesive aggregate (type A) as an internal core so that the system avoids exposing the less cohesive tissue to high-energy configurations and achieves the liquid-like equilibrium mandated by the differential adhesion hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium arrangement is that type A forms a central cohesive mass that is engulfed by type B, which matches option A. Options B and D do not match the ordering $J_{AA}  J_{BB}$: if B were more cohesive, B would be inside, but here A is more cohesive; and two adjacent aggregates (D) do not capture the known engulfment outcome when cohesivities differ and heterotypic contacts are disfavored.\n\nHence the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1676839"}, {"introduction": "While the Differential Adhesion Hypothesis predicts that cells will sort to achieve a global energy minimum, the complex journey to that state can lead to arrangements that are stable but not optimal—so-called \"kinetically trapped\" states.
