The primary division of flowering plants into monocotyledons and dicotyledons is based on characteristics established during embryogenesis. This first practice challenges you to apply your knowledge of these defining features to classify a plant specimen, reinforcing the link between developmental pathways and large-scale botanical classification [@problem_id:1708136].", "problem": "A botanist specializing in developmental biology is examining the seeds of a newly discovered species of flowering plant. Through careful dissection and microscopy, the botanist characterizes the structure of the mature embryo within the seed. The observations reveal that the embryo possesses a single, prominent, shield-shaped cotyledon positioned laterally to the embryonic axis. Furthermore, the embryonic shoot apex is protected by a specialized sheath known as the coleoptile, and the embryonic root is similarly covered by a sheath called the coleorhiza.\n\nBased on this specific set of embryonic characteristics, how would this plant species most accurately be classified?\n\nA. Gymnosperm\nB. Pteridophyte\nC. Dicotyledon (Dicot)\nD. Monocotyledon (Monocot)\nE. Bryophyte", "solution": "We identify diagnostic embryological features described and match them to plant groups using standard botanical criteria.\n\n1. The embryo has a single, prominent, shield-shaped cotyledon positioned laterally to the embryonic axis. In monocotyledons, the single cotyledon is termed the scutellum and is typically shield-shaped and lateral. Dicots characteristically possess two cotyledons, and gymnosperms often have two or more cotyledons; thus a single, shield-shaped, lateral cotyledon specifically indicates a monocot embryo.\n\n2. The embryonic shoot apex is enclosed by a coleoptile, and the embryonic root is enclosed by a coleorhiza. These protective sheaths are defining features of monocot embryos (especially prominent in grasses and related monocots). Dicots lack both coleoptile and coleorhiza; their plumule and radicle are not enclosed in these specific sheaths.\n\n3. Bryophytes and pteridophytes do not produce seeds and therefore do not have seed embryos with cotyledons; this excludes options E and B outright. Gymnosperms are seed plants but do not have coleoptile or coleorhiza and typically do not show a lateral scutellum; many gymnosperms are polycotyledonous. Thus option A is excluded.\n\nGiven the combined presence of a single, lateral, shield-shaped cotyledon (scutellum) together with coleoptile and coleorhiza, the correct classification is Monocotyledon.\n\nTherefore, among the options, the accurate choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1708136"}, {"introduction": "Moving from macroscopic structures to the molecular level, we explore how polarity is actively established. The plant hormone auxin is a master regulator of development, and its non-uniform distribution creates gradients that guide cell fate and patterning. This exercise delves into the chemiosmotic model of auxin transport, a classic example of how basic physicochemical principles—specifically pH gradients—can be harnessed by a cell to concentrate a signaling molecule. By working through this quantitative problem, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the so-called \"acid-trap\" mechanism that is fundamental to establishing auxin maxima in the embryo [@problem_id:1708141].", "problem": "A researcher is developing a quantitative model for the accumulation of the plant hormone auxin (Indole-3-acetic acid, or IAA) in plant embryonic cells. IAA is a weak acid with an acid dissociation constant ($pK_a$) of 4.75. The cytoplasm of the embryonic cells is maintained at a constant pH of 7.2. The model assumes that a steady state is reached when the concentration of the uncharged, protonated form of IAA is identical in the cytoplasm and in the external apoplastic fluid. Furthermore, the model considers that only this uncharged form can cross the cell membrane passively.\n\nAn embryo is initially in a steady state with its apoplastic fluid at a pH of 5.0. It is then moved to a new environment where the external fluid pH is 7.0. The total concentration of IAA (sum of its protonated and deprotonated forms) in the external fluid is held constant between these two conditions.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the total intracellular IAA concentration in the final steady state (external pH 7.0) to the total intracellular IAA concentration in the initial steady state (external pH 5.0).

A common feature of these networks is genetic redundancy, where the function of one gene can be partially compensated for by another, ensuring the robustness of the developmental process. This practice explores the powerful concept of genetic synergy, where the combined loss of two related genes leads to a much more severe defect than expected from their individual effects. Using hypothetical data on mutations in the crucial `WOX` family of transcription factors, you will quantify this synergistic interaction, providing insight into how developmental systems are both resilient and vulnerable [@problem_id:1708179].", "problem": "In plant development, the establishment of the apical-basal axis in the zygote is a foundational event, determining the future shoot and root. A family of transcription factors known as WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) proteins plays a critical role in this process. A developmental biologist is studying the effects of mutations in two such genes, *WOX8* and *WOX9*, in an experimental plant species.\n\nThe wild-type versions of the genes are denoted *WOX8+* and *WOX9+*, while the non-functional (loss-of-function) mutant alleles are *wox8-* and *wox9-*.

The findings are as follows:\n- For genotypes with at least one functional copy of both genes (e.g., *WOX8+/+ WOX9+/-*), the success rate is $99.0\\%$. This is considered the baseline wild-type performance.\n- For genotypes that are homozygous mutant for *wox8* but have at least one functional copy of *wox9* (i.e., *wox8-/- WOX9+*), the success rate is $95.0\\%$.\n- For genotypes that are homozygous mutant for *wox9* but have at least one functional copy of *wox8* (i.e., *WOX8+ wox9-/-*), the success rate is $97.0\\%$.\n- For the double homozygous mutant genotype (*wox8-/- wox9-/-*), the success rate plummets to $1.0\\%$.\n\nTo quantify the functional relationship between these two genes, the biologist proposes a \"Synergistic Defect Index\" (SDI).
