This model posits that three classes of homeotic genes (Class A, Class B, and Class C) interact combinatorially to specify the identity of organs in the four concentric whorls of a flower.\n\nThe rules for organ identity are as follows, from outermost to innermost whorl:\n- Whorl 1: Class A gene expression alone specifies Sepals.\n- Whorl 2: Class A and Class B gene expression together specify Petals.\n- Whorl 3: Class B and Class C gene expression together specify Stamens.\n- Whorl 4: Class C gene expression alone specifies Carpels.\n\nA key feature of this model is the mutual antagonism between Class A and Class C genes.

Instead of the normal four distinct organ types, all four whorls of the flower develop into sepal-like structures. This phenotype is known to be caused by a double mutation, resulting in the complete loss of function of two of the three gene classes.\n\nWhich of the following double knockouts is responsible for this \"all sepals\" phenotype?\n\nA.

This advanced problem challenges you to think like a developmental biologist by interpreting an experiment designed to investigate *how* gene activities are spatially regulated. You will explore the crucial concept of cell autonomy to determine if the repression between gene classes occurs strictly within a cell or through a diffusible signal that acts on its neighbors [@problem_id:1687157].", "problem": "In the study of flower development in the model organism *Arabidopsis thaliana*, the ABC model provides a framework for understanding how homeotic genes specify the identity of floral organs in four concentric whorls. The model posits three classes of gene function: A-class genes (e.g., *APETALA1*, or *AP1*) specify sepals in whorl 1; A- and B-class genes together specify petals in whorl 2; B- and C-class genes together specify stamens in whorl 3; and C-class genes (e.g., *AGAMOUS*, or *AG*) specify carpels in whorl 4. A key feature of this model is the mutual antagonism between A-class and C-class genes: A-function represses C-gene expression in the outer two whorls, and C-function represses A-gene expression in the inner two whorls.\n\nA researcher proposes a specific hypothesis regarding the mechanism of this repression: the boundary between the A and C domains is sharpened by a non-cell-autonomous repressor. Specifically, the hypothesis states that the *AG* gene product does not directly repress *AP1*, but instead induces the production of a mobile signaling molecule that diffuses from the C-domain into adjacent cells to repress *AP1* transcription.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, you are provided with an experimental system. You have *Arabidopsis* plants that are homozygous for a transcriptional reporter construct, *pAP1::GFP*. In these plants, the promoter of the *AP1* gene drives the expression of a stable Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Using an inducible recombination system, you can generate small, clonal patches of homozygous *ag/ag* mutant tissue within an otherwise wild-type (*AG/AG*) plant.\n\nConsider an experiment where you successfully induce several small *ag/ag* mutant clones, each located entirely within the developing fourth whorl (the carpel primordium). Assuming the researcher's non-cell-autonomous repression hypothesis is correct, which of the following outcomes describes the expected pattern of GFP expression in and around these fourth-whorl clones?\n\nA. The *pAP1::GFP* reporter will be expressed (GFP ON) only within the cells of the *ag/ag* clone. The surrounding wild-type *AG/AG* tissue will show no GFP expression.\n\nB. The *pAP1::GFP* reporter will not be expressed (GFP OFF) within the cells of the *ag/ag* clone, and it will also be OFF in the surrounding wild-type *AG/AG* tissue.\n\nC. The *pAP1::GFP* reporter will be expressed (GFP ON) in both the cells of the *ag/ag* clone and in a small halo of surrounding wild-type *AG/AG* tissue.\n\nD. The *pAP1::GFP* reporter will be expressed (GFP ON) in the wild-type *AG/AG* tissue immediately surrounding the clone, but will not be expressed (GFP OFF) within the clone itself.\n\nE. The *pAP1::GFP* reporter will be expressed (GFP ON) throughout the entire fourth whorl, irrespective of the presence or genotype of the clone.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the outcome of a genetic mosaic experiment designed to test the hypothesis that the repression of the A-class gene *AP1* by the C-class gene *AG* is non-cell-autonomous.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the baseline state and the reporter.**\nThe experiment is conducted in plants carrying a *pAP1::GFP* reporter. This means that GFP fluorescence directly indicates transcriptional activity of the *AP1* gene. The experiment focuses on the fourth whorl, which in a wild-type flower is the C-domain. According to the ABC model, C-function (*AG*) represses A-function (*AP1*) in the fourth whorl. Therefore, in a normal wild-type fourth whorl, *AG* is ON, *AP1* is OFF, and consequently, there is no GFP expression.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the competing models: cell-autonomous vs. non-cell-autonomous repression.**\n*   **Cell-autonomous repression (the null hypothesis):** In this model, the machinery that represses *AP1* must be present *within* the same cell. A cell must express *AG* itself to repress its own *AP1* transcription. If a cell loses *AG* function (becomes *ag/ag*), it would lose the ability to repress *AP1*, and *AP1* expression would be de-repressed.\n*   **Non-cell-autonomous repression (the hypothesis to be tested):** In this model, *AG*-expressing cells produce a mobile signal (a repressor molecule) that travels to nearby cells to repress *AP1*. This means a cell does not need to express *AG* itself to have its *AP1* gene repressed, as long as it receives the signal from a neighbor.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the experimental setup.**\nThe experiment creates small clones of *ag/ag* mutant cells within the fourth whorl. These clones are \"islands\" of tissue lacking C-function, surrounded by a \"sea\" of wild-type *AG/AG* tissue that has normal C-function.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the outcome based on the non-cell-autonomous hypothesis.**\nWe assume the hypothesis is correct.\n*   **Consider the wild-type *AG/AG* cells surrounding the clone:** These cells express *AG*. According to the hypothesis, they produce the mobile repressor signal. They also repress their own *AP1* promoter. Thus, *pAP1::GFP* is OFF in these cells.\n*   **Consider the *ag/ag* mutant cells within the clone:** These cells lack the *AG* gene product. Therefore, they cannot produce the mobile repressor signal themselves.\n*   **Consider the interaction:** The mobile repressor signal, produced by the surrounding wild-type *AG/AG* cells, diffuses into the adjacent *ag/ag* mutant clone.\n*   **Effect on the clone:** The *ag/ag* cells, despite lacking their own *AG* function, now receive the extrinsic repressor signal from their neighbors. This signal acts on the *AP1* promoter within the *ag/ag* cells, causing its repression.\n*   **Final observation:** As a result, the *AP1* promoter remains OFF, and no GFP is produced, *both* in the surrounding wild-type tissue *and* within the *ag/ag* mutant clone. The phenotype of the mutant cells is \"rescued\" by the surrounding wild-type cells.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the multiple-choice options.**\n*   **A. GFP ON only within the clone:** This is the expected outcome for a *cell-autonomous* repression mechanism, where the loss of *AG* within a cell directly leads to the de-repression of *AP1* in that same cell. This contradicts the non-cell-autonomous hypothesis.\n*   **B. GFP OFF within the clone and in the surrounding tissue:** This matches our prediction. The repressor signal from the surrounding tissue enters the clone and keeps *AP1* turned off. The surrounding tissue has its own *AG* to keep *AP1* off. Therefore, no GFP is visible anywhere in or around the clone.\n*   **C. GFP ON in the clone and a surrounding halo:** This would suggest a non-cell-autonomous *activator* of *AP1* is being released from the mutant clone, which is inconsistent with any part of the model.\n*   **D. GFP ON in surrounding tissue, OFF in the clone:** This is illogical. The surrounding tissue is wild-type for the C-domain and should be repressing *AP1*, not expressing it.\n*   **E. GFP ON throughout the entire whorl:** This would imply that a small clone has a massive, long-range effect, which is highly unlikely and not predicted by the hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the correct prediction based on the non-cell-autonomous repressor hypothesis is that the *pAP1::GFP* reporter remains unexpressed (GFP OFF) everywhere in the fourth whorl, including within the *ag/ag* mutant clone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1687157"}]}
