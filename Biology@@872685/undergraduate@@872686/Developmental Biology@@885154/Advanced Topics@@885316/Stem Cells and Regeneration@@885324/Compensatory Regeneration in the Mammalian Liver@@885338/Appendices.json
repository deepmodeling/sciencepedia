Their central hypothesis is that regeneration is driven by a combination of a systemic, blood-borne (humoral) signal produced by the liver remnant and a local, non-circulating signal that is intrinsic to the damaged tissue.\n\nTo test this, they perform a parabiosis experiment, surgically joining two genetically identical mice (Mouse A and Mouse B) so that they share a common blood circulation. Subsequently, Mouse A undergoes a 2/3 Partial Hepatectomy (PHx), a procedure where two-thirds of its liver is surgically removed. Mouse B undergoes a sham operation but its liver remains intact.\n\nAfter 48 hours, the point of peak cell division, the researchers measure the Proliferative Index (PI) in the livers of both mice. The PI is defined as the fraction of hepatocytes (the main liver cells) that are actively synthesizing DNA in preparation for cell division. The following data were collected:\n\n- The baseline PI in a normal, unoperated control mouse is 0.002.\n- The PI measured in the remaining liver tissue of the hepatectomized mouse (Mouse A) is 0.350.\n- The PI measured in the intact liver of the partner mouse (Mouse B) is 0.120.\n\nAssuming that the total increase in the Proliferative Index above the baseline level in any liver is a simple sum of the effects from the systemic humoral signal and the local signal, calculate the ratio of the proliferative drive from the systemic humoral signal to the proliferative drive from the local signal within the regenerating liver of Mouse A.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $b$ denote the baseline proliferative index in an unoperated control liver, $P_{A}$ the proliferative index in the regenerating liver of Mouse A after partial hepatectomy, and $P_{B}$ the proliferative index in the intact liver of the parabiosed partner Mouse B.\n\nBy the problem’s assumption, the total increase above baseline in any liver is the sum of the systemic humoral drive $H$ and the local, non-circulating drive $L$ (the latter present only in the damaged liver).

This process involves the proliferation and growth of the remaining tissue after injury to restore the original organ mass. To investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, a chimeric mouse has been engineered such that its liver is composed of an equal number of two types of hepatocytes: wild-type (WT) hepatocytes, which have a normal cell cycle and can undergo cell division (hyperplasia), and mutant hepatocytes, which are null for the Cyclin D1 gene ($\\textit{Ccnd1}^{-/-}$) and thus cannot enter the cell cycle to divide. These non-proliferating mutant cells are, however, capable of compensatory growth by increasing their cell size (hypertrophy).\n\nA standard two-thirds partial hepatectomy is performed on this mouse, meaning two-thirds of the total liver mass is surgically removed. The remaining liver remnant regenerates, precisely restoring the original total liver mass. For your model, assume the following:\n1.  Initially, all hepatocytes, both WT and mutant, have the same average mass, $m_0$.\n2.  During regeneration, the mutant hepatocytes in the remnant double their average mass to $2m_0$ through hypertrophy.\n3.
