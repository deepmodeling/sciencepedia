{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding morphallaxis begins with recognizing its signature characteristics at the cellular and tissue level. Unlike other forms of regeneration that rely on generating new cells, morphallaxis is fundamentally about remodeling what is already there. This exercise challenges you to act as an experimental observer, distinguishing the defining features of morphallactic regeneration from other biological processes based on a classic amputation experiment [@problem_id:1701372].", "problem": "In developmental biology, regeneration of lost body parts is broadly classified into two major modes. Epimorphosis, common in vertebrates like salamanders, involves the dedifferentiation of cells at the wound site to form a mass of proliferating cells called a blastema, which then grows and redifferentiates to replace the lost structure. In contrast, morphallaxis, characteristic of organisms like the freshwater polyp *Hydra*, involves the transformation and repatterning of existing tissues with minimal cell proliferation to restore the missing parts.\n\nAn experiment is conducted on a specimen of *Hydra vulgaris*. A single tentacle is carefully amputated at its base, precisely where it joins the hypostome (the conical region at the oral end that houses the mouth). The animal is then observed under a microscope over several days to monitor the regenerative process. Which of the following descriptions of the events at the wound site would be the definitive evidence that the tentacle is regenerating via morphallaxis?\n\nA. A dome-shaped cap of small, undifferentiated cells rapidly forms over the wound. This cap, a blastema, shows a very high rate of cell division and grows outwards before differentiating into a new tentacle structure.\n\nB. The tissue of the hypostome directly adjacent to the amputation site undergoes remodeling. Existing epithelial cells change their shape and organization to form a small tentacle bud that elongates, all while the overall cell division rate in the animal remains largely at its normal homeostatic level.\n\nC. The wound site quickly heals and is covered by a layer of flattened epithelial cells, but no new tentacle emerges. The *Hydra* now permanently has one fewer tentacle.\n\nD. A stream of specialized migratory stem cells is observed moving from the gastric region of the body column towards the wound site. These cells accumulate and then differentiate to directly form the new tentacle.", "solution": "The core of the problem is to identify the observational evidence that corresponds to the definition of morphallactic regeneration, as opposed to other processes like epimorphosis or simple wound healing. The problem statement provides the key definitions needed for this task.\n\nFirst, let's re-examine the definition of morphallaxis provided: it is regeneration through the \"transformation and repatterning of existing tissues\" with \"minimal cell proliferation\". This means the organism reshuffles and re-specifies cells that are already present to rebuild the lost structure, rather than growing a new one from scratch through rapid cell division.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A:** This option describes the formation of a \"blastema\" characterized by a \"very high rate of cell division\". A blastema is the hallmark of epimorphosis, not morphallaxis. This process involves the creation of new tissue through proliferation, which directly contradicts the key feature of morphallaxis in *Hydra*. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option B:** This option describes the \"remodeling\" and \"reorganizing\" of \"existing epithelial cells\" from the hypostome tissue adjacent to the wound. It explicitly states that this occurs while the \"cell division rate... remains largely at its normal homeostatic level\". This description perfectly aligns with the definition of morphallaxis: the repatterning of existing tissue without a burst of new, growth-oriented cell proliferation. The existing body part (the hypostome) is reshaped to form the new part (the tentacle). Therefore, option B is the correct description.\n\n**Option C:** This option describes a failure to regenerate. While wound healing is part of the process, the complete absence of a new tentacle is contrary to the known, powerful regenerative capabilities of *Hydra*. This describes simple tissue repair without regeneration, so it is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:** This option describes regeneration driven by a targeted migration of stem cells from a distant location. While *Hydra* does possess stem cells (interstitial cells) that are crucial for its continuous self-renewal, the process of morphallaxis is primarily characterized by the re-specification of committed epithelial cells that are already in place. The large-scale remodeling of these existing cell sheets is the defining event. While stem cells are involved, describing the process as a targeted migration and accumulation of stem cells to form the new part is more characteristic of the regeneration mechanism seen in planarians (which use neoblasts) and is not the primary definition of morphallaxis in *Hydra*. The key event in *Hydra* morphallaxis is the repatterning of the existing epithelial layers. Therefore, option D is not the most accurate and definitive description.\n\nIn summary, option B is the only choice that accurately and definitively describes the cellular and tissue-level events characteristic of morphallactic regeneration as it occurs in *Hydra*.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1701372"}, {"introduction": "Beyond observing the process, a deeper understanding of regeneration comes from exploring its underlying molecular controls. In *Hydra*, the establishment of the head-to-foot body axis is governed by a precise system of signaling molecules, with the Wnt pathway acting as the master regulator of head formation. This problem presents a thought experiment involving a genetic manipulation, testing your ability to predict the outcome of regeneration by applying the core principles of this molecular logic [@problem_id:1701341].", "problem": "The freshwater polyp *Hydra* is a classic model organism for studying regeneration. Its body plan consists of a head with a mouth and tentacles at the apical end, a gastric body column, and a foot (basal disc) at the basal end. *Hydra* regenerates through a process known as morphallaxis, where existing tissues are re-patterned to form the missing structures, largely without new cell proliferation.\n\nThe establishment of the head organizer is controlled by the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. High levels of Wnt signaling at the apical pole specify head formation. Researchers have identified a hypothetical gene, which we will call `Pedin`, that is normally expressed only in the cells of the foot. Experimental evidence suggests that the Pedin protein product is a potent inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.\n\nTo investigate the role of `Pedin` in establishing body polarity, a transgenic line of *Hydra* was created. In this line, the `Pedin` gene is constitutively overexpressed in all epithelial cells throughout the animal's body. An individual from this transgenic line is then bisected transversely through the middle of its gastric body column, and the resulting isolated body column fragment is allowed to regenerate in a suitable medium.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes is the most likely result of this experiment?\n\nA. The body column regenerates a normal head at its original apical end and a normal foot at its original basal end.\n\nB. The body column regenerates a head at both the apical and basal ends, resulting in an animal with two heads.\n\nC. The body column fails to regenerate and the tissue eventually dies.\n\nD. The body column regenerates a foot at its original apical end, resulting in an animal with two feet and no head.\n\nE. The body column regenerates a head at its original basal end and a foot at its original apical end, showing a complete reversal of polarity.", "solution": "Hydra axial patterning and regeneration rely on a head organizer at the apical pole that is specified by high activity of the canonical Wnt/$\\beta$-catenin signaling pathway. Principle: head formation requires elevated Wnt/$\\beta$-catenin signaling; conversely, foot identity is associated with low Wnt signaling and expression of Wnt antagonists at the basal end.\n\nBy premise, Pedin is normally a foot-specific gene whose protein potently inhibits Wnt/$\\beta$-catenin signaling. In the transgenic line, Pedin is constitutively overexpressed in all epithelial cells throughout the body, making Wnt/$\\beta$-catenin signaling uniformly low.\n\nUpon bisection through the gastric column and regeneration by morphallaxis, the fragment must re-establish polarity. However, because Wnt/$\\beta$-catenin signaling is globally inhibited, the apical end of the fragment cannot achieve the high Wnt activity required to establish the head organizer. Without head organizer activity, head-specific gene expression and morphogenesis of mouth and tentacles fail.\n\nIn contrast, low Wnt conditions favor basal/foot identity. Thus, in the presence of ubiquitous Wnt inhibition, the apical side that would normally form a head is biased toward basal fate. The original basal end remains basal. Therefore, the most likely outcome is the regeneration of a foot at the original apical end, yielding an animal with two feet and no head.\n\nThis outcome excludes:\n- A: Normal polarity requires a proper apical Wnt maximum, which is prevented by global Pedin.\n- B: Two heads require ectopic Wnt activation, not inhibition.\n- C: Hydra tissues typically survive and repattern; Pedin overexpression biases fate rather than causing nonspecific death.\n- E: Polarity reversal with a head at the basal end would require a Wnt maximum at the basal end, which is incompatible with global Wnt inhibition.\n\nTherefore, the most likely result is two feet and no head, corresponding to a foot regenerating at the original apical end.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1701341"}, {"introduction": "Developmental biologists often use mathematical models to translate conceptual frameworks into testable, quantitative predictions. This problem allows you to engage with such a model, which describes the concentration gradient of a key signaling molecule—the head inhibitor. By applying this simplified diffusion-and-decay model, you will calculate a concrete, measurable outcome: the time it takes for a new head to begin forming after decapitation [@problem_id:1701329].", "problem": "The freshwater polyp *Hydra* is a classic model organism for studying morphallactic regeneration, a process where missing structures are reformed by remodeling existing tissues. The formation of a head is controlled by a signaling molecule, a \"head inhibitor,\" that is produced by the hypostome (the head organizer) and diffuses down the body column.\n\nConsider a simplified one-dimensional model of a *Hydra* of total body length $L$. The hypostome at position $x=0$ maintains a constant concentration $C_0$ of the inhibitor. The inhibitor diffuses along the body and is simultaneously degraded via a first-order chemical reaction with a rate constant $k$. The other end of the animal is at $x=L$. Under these conditions, a stable concentration gradient is established. The steady-state concentration of the inhibitor at a position $x$ along the body is given by the equation:\n$$ C_{ss}(x) = C_0 \\frac{\\sinh(\\lambda(L-x))}{\\sinh(\\lambda L)} $$\nwhere $\\lambda = \\sqrt{k/D}$, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of the inhibitor.\n\nAn experiment is performed where the hypostome is surgically removed, but the adjacent whorl of tentacles remains. The tissue that will form the new head is at a position $x_p$ from the site of the cut. We will make a simplifying assumption that after the hypostome is removed, the primary mechanism for the reduction of inhibitor concentration at any point is its local degradation. That is, the concentration at position $x_p$ evolves over time $t$ according to $C(x_p, t) = C_{ss}(x_p) \\exp(-kt)$, where $C_{ss}(x_p)$ is the initial concentration at that point a moment before the cut.\n\nA new head will begin to form at position $x_p$ when the inhibitor concentration there drops below a critical threshold value, $C_{th}$.\n\nGiven the following parameters, calculate the time it will take for regeneration of a new head to begin.\n-   Body length, $L = 5.00 \\text{ mm}$\n-   Position of regenerative tissue, $x_p = 0.250 \\text{ mm}$\n-   Inhibitor diffusion coefficient, $D = 7.20 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ mm}^2/\\text{hr}$\n-   Inhibitor degradation rate constant, $k = 7.20 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ hr}^{-1}$\n-   Ratio of source to threshold concentration, $C_0 / C_{th} = 20.0$\n\nExpress your answer for the regeneration time in hours, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "At steady state with the hypostome present at $x=0$, the inhibitor concentration profile is\n$$\nC_{ss}(x)=C_{0}\\,\\frac{\\sinh\\!\\left(\\lambda\\left(L-x\\right)\\right)}{\\sinh\\!\\left(\\lambda L\\right)}, \\quad \\lambda=\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}.\n$$\nImmediately after removing the hypostome, under the assumption that local degradation dominates, the concentration at position $x_{p}$ decays exponentially:\n$$\nC(x_{p},t)=C_{ss}(x_{p})\\,\\exp(-k t).\n$$\nHead regeneration initiates when $C(x_{p},t)$ falls to the threshold $C_{th}$, so we solve\n$$\nC_{ss}(x_{p})\\,\\exp(-k t^{\\ast})=C_{th}.\n$$\nRearranging gives\n$$\nt^{\\ast}=\\frac{1}{k}\\,\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{C_{ss}(x_{p})}{C_{th}}\\right)=\\frac{1}{k}\\left[\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{C_{th}}\\right)+\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{\\sinh\\!\\left(\\lambda\\left(L-x_{p}\\right)\\right)}{\\sinh\\!\\left(\\lambda L\\right)}\\right)\\right].\n$$\n\nInsert parameters.
