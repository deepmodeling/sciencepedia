{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The establishment of planar cell polarity across a tissue is not a top-down command, but an emergent property arising from local conversations between neighboring cells. These conversations are governed by a core set of molecular rules involving feedback loops that amplify and stabilize asymmetry. This problem [@problem_id:1707888] challenges you to act as a molecular detective at a single cell-cell boundary, using a simplified but powerful model of intercellular stabilization and intracellular repulsion. By predicting protein localization in a genetic mosaic, you will gain a deeper intuition for how these fundamental feedback mechanisms operate to build order from local interactions.", "problem": "Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) is a fundamental biological process that orients cells within the plane of a tissue. In a simple epithelial sheet, this polarity is established by two core groups of proteins that segregate to opposite sides of each cell. Let's call these the Frizzled (Fz) complex and the Van Gogh (Vang) complex. Their localization is governed by a set of feedback interactions.\n\nFor this problem, we will use a simplified model with two rules:\n1.  **Intercellular Stabilization:** At the shared membrane between two adjacent cells, Fz protein from one cell and Vang protein from the neighboring cell bind to each other, forming a stable \"bridge\" that locks them in place.\n2.  **Intracellular Repulsion:** Within a single cell, the Fz complex and the Vang complex are mutually inhibitory. The accumulation of one complex at a specific region of the cell membrane prevents the other complex from accumulating at that same location.\n\nConsider a genetic mosaic experiment in an epithelial tissue. A clone of cells has been generated that carries a null mutation for the *Van Gogh* gene, meaning these cells (`vang-/-`) can produce Fz but cannot produce any Vang protein. These mutant cells are surrounded by wild-type (WT) cells, which produce both Fz and Vang.\n\nAway from the clone, in WT-WT cell pairings, the system reaches a stable state where the Fz complex consistently localizes to one side of the cell (e.g., the \"distal\" side) and the Vang complex localizes to the opposite side (the \"proximal\" side).\n\nNow, focus on the specific interface between a single WT cell and an adjacent `vang-/-` cell. Based *only* on the two rules provided, what is the predicted localization of Fz and Vang proteins at this boundary?\n\nA. The WT cell will accumulate Vang protein at the boundary, and the `vang-/-` cell will accumulate Fz protein at the boundary.\n\nB. The WT cell will accumulate Fz protein at the boundary, and the `vang-/-` cell will have no specific protein accumulation at the boundary.\n\nC. Both Fz and Vang proteins will be absent from the boundary membrane in both the WT and `vang-/-` cells.\n\nD. The WT cell will accumulate Fz protein at the boundary, and the `vang-/-` cell will also accumulate Fz protein at the boundary.\n\nE. The WT cell will accumulate Vang protein at the boundary, and the `vang-/-` cell will have no specific protein accumulation at the boundary.", "solution": "We apply the two given rules to the specific WT–vang-/- boundary.\n\nRule 1 (Intercellular Stabilization): Stabilization at a shared membrane requires a heterotypic bridge composed of Fz from one cell and Vang from the adjacent cell. At the WT–vang-/- interface, the vang-/- cell lacks Vang but still has Fz, while the WT cell has both Fz and Vang. Therefore, the only possible stabilizing bridge across this boundary is WT Vang bound to mutant Fz. A bridge of WT Fz to mutant Vang cannot form because the mutant has no Vang. Hence, this rule predicts accumulation of Vang on the WT side and Fz on the vang-/- side at the shared boundary.\n\nRule 2 (Intracellular Repulsion): Within each cell, local accumulation of one complex inhibits the other at the same membrane region. In the WT cell, Vang accumulation at the boundary repels WT Fz from that boundary, reinforcing Vang enrichment there. In the vang-/- cell, Fz accumulation at the boundary would repel Vang, but no Vang is present, so there is no conflict and Fz remains enriched.\n\nEliminating alternatives:\n- WT Fz at the boundary (as in B or D) would require a stabilizing Vang partner across the junction, which the vang-/- cell cannot provide; thus there is no bridge to stabilize WT Fz there.\n- Absence of both (C) contradicts the existence of the possible WT-Vang to mutant-Fz bridge.\n- WT Vang with no mutant accumulation (E) contradicts the stabilizing effect that also recruits and locks mutant Fz at the boundary.\n\nTherefore, the boundary will have Vang on the WT side and Fz on the vang-/- side, matching option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1707888"}, {"introduction": "Establishing cellular asymmetry is only the first step; the ultimate function of the Planar Cell Polarity pathway is to direct cellular behaviors that shape tissues and organs. This process involves a signaling cascade that translates the \"where\" of protein localization into the \"what\" of cytoskeletal action. In this exercise [@problem_id:1707912], you will explore the critical link between the core PCP machinery and the downstream effector RhoA, which drives cell contractility during convergent extension. By analyzing a hypothetical mutation that uncouples these two modules, you can practice thinking about signaling pathways as distinct but connected functional units.", "problem": "In vertebrate embryos, the process of convergent extension is critical for narrowing the mediolateral axis and elongating the anteroposterior axis of the developing body plan. This morphogenetic movement is driven by the coordinated intercalation of cells, a process regulated by the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. In a simplified model of this pathway, the transmembrane proteins Frizzled (Fz) and Van Gogh (Vang) localize to opposite ends of a cell. This asymmetry recruits the protein Dishevelled (Dsh) to the Fz-rich pole of the cell membrane. Dsh then recruits Dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis 1 (Daam1), which in turn binds to and activates the small GTPase RhoA. Activated RhoA stimulates Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), leading to localized phosphorylation of myosin light chain and subsequent actomyosin contractility. This localized contractility is the driving force for cell intercalation.\n\nConsider a hypothetical homozygous mutant embryo where the gene for Daam1 has been altered. The resulting Daam1 protein has a specific point mutation that completely abrogates its ability to bind to and activate RhoA. However, this mutation has no effect on Daam1's ability to be recruited to the membrane by Dsh.\n\nBased on this specific molecular defect, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected phenotype in the region of the embryo undergoing convergent extension?\n\nA. Cells will exhibit normal asymmetric localization of Fz, Vang, and Dsh, but will fail to intercalate, resulting in a failure of tissue elongation.\n\nB. Cells will show a complete loss of polarity, with Fz, Vang, and Dsh being uniformly distributed around the cell membrane, leading to disorganized tissue.\n\nC. Cells will display hyper-contractility and random, chaotic movements because the uncoupling of Daam1 and RhoA removes a negative feedback loop.\n\nD. The Dsh protein will fail to localize to the cell membrane, but downstream RhoA will be constitutively active, leading to global tissue constriction.\n\nE. The embryo will develop normally, as redundant signaling pathways that do not involve Daam1 will compensate for the loss of RhoA activation.", "solution": "1. State the normal pathway logic for convergent extension regulated by Planar Cell Polarity (PCP): PCP establishes asymmetric localization of transmembrane components such that Frizzled (Fz) and Van Gogh (Vang) accumulate on opposite sides of a cell. Dishevelled (Dsh) is recruited to the Fz-enriched pole. Dsh then recruits Daam1. Daam1 binds to and activates RhoA. Activated RhoA stimulates ROCK, which phosphorylates myosin light chain, thereby promoting localized actomyosin contractility. This localized contractility drives polarized cell intercalation, producing narrowing along the mediolateral axis and elongation along the anteroposterior axis.\n\n2. Specify the precise molecular defect in the mutant: The Daam1 point mutation specifically abolishes its ability to bind to and activate RhoA. The mutation does not impair Daam1 recruitment by Dsh. Therefore, upstream PCP polarity (Fz/Vang asymmetry) and Dsh localization remain intact, and Daam1 still localizes to the membrane at the Fz-rich pole.\n\n3. Deduce the immediate downstream effect: Because mutated Daam1 cannot bind to or activate RhoA, the local activation of RhoA at the Dsh/Daam1-enriched pole fails. Consequently, ROCK is not activated locally, myosin light chain is not phosphorylated efficiently at that pole, and the localized actomyosin contractility required for intercalation does not occur.\n\n4. Predict the cell-level phenotype: Cells retain normal PCP polarity markers (asymmetric Fz, Vang, and Dsh) and proper membrane recruitment of Daam1, but they lack the localized contractile activity needed to drive intercalation. Therefore, cells fail to intercalate.\n\n5. Predict the tissue-level phenotype in the convergent extension region: Without coordinated intercalations, the tissue fails to undergo effective narrowing and elongation, producing a failure of tissue elongation characteristic of convergent extension defects (shorter and broader tissue).\n\n6. Evaluate the options:\n- A: Matches the deduction: polarity markers normal (Fz, Vang, Dsh asymmetric), but failure of intercalation and tissue elongation due to loss of Daam1-mediated RhoA activation.\n- B: Incorrect; PCP polarity upstream is intact, so Fz, Vang, and Dsh will not be uniformly distributed.\n- C: Incorrect; loss of RhoA activation reduces, not increases, contractility; no basis for hyper-contractility or chaos from this lesion.\n- D: Incorrect; Dsh recruitment is explicitly normal, and RhoA is not constitutively active; the lesion blocks its activation by Daam1.\n- E: Incorrect; while partial redundancy can exist in some contexts, the specified critical link from PCP to RhoA-dependent contractility is severed; the expected phenotype is a convergent extension failure rather than normal development.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1707912"}, {"introduction": "Development is a process that unfolds in time, and understanding the temporal requirements of a gene's function is as crucial as knowing its molecular role.
