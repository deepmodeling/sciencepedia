In its active state, it acts to suppress tissue growth. A core component of this pathway is the kinase Large Tumor Suppressor Kinase 1 (LATS1). When active, LATS1 phosphorylates a transcriptional co-activator known as Yes-associated protein (YAP). This phosphorylation causes YAP to be retained in the cytoplasm and subsequently degraded, preventing it from entering the nucleus. In the absence of LATS1-mediated phosphorylation, YAP translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to TEAD family transcription factors to promote the expression of genes that drive cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis.\n\nConsider two independent experiments conducted in mice, where a tissue-specific gene knockout is induced only in liver cells (hepatocytes) after the liver has reached its normal adult size.\n\n*   **Experiment A:** A conditional knockout of the *LATS1* gene.\n*   **Experiment B:** A conditional knockout of the *YAP* gene.\n\nAssuming the mice are observed for several weeks after the knockout is induced, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the resulting change in liver size for each experiment, relative to a normal, wild-type mouse?\n\nA.

In both Experiment A and Experiment B, liver size will remain unchanged.", "solution": "The Hippo pathway restrains organ growth when active. A core step is phosphorylation of YAP by LATS1, which causes YAP cytoplasmic retention and degradation, preventing YAP from acting in the nucleus with TEAD to drive pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic gene expression.\n\nFor Experiment A (conditional knockout of LATS1 in adult hepatocytes), removing LATS1 eliminates YAP phosphorylation. Without this inhibitory phosphorylation, YAP is not efficiently retained in the cytoplasm or targeted for degradation. Consequently, more YAP translocates to the nucleus, where it binds TEAD and increases transcription of genes that promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis. The net effect is increased tissue growth, so liver size increases relative to wild-type.\n\nFor Experiment B (conditional knockout of YAP in adult hepatocytes), removing YAP eliminates the key transcriptional co-activator required for TEAD-mediated expression of growth-promoting and survival genes. Even with normal upstream signaling, without YAP, the pro-growth output is diminished. This reduces hepatocyte proliferation and reduces inhibition of apoptosis, leading to a net loss of liver mass over time. The net effect is decreased tissue size, so liver size decreases relative to wild-type.\n\nTherefore, Experiment A yields increased liver size and Experiment B yields decreased liver size, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1722895"}, {"introduction": "The Hippo pathway is dynamically regulated in response to physiological demands like tissue growth and repair. This problem challenges you to connect the pathway's molecular state to a real-world biological process: liver regeneration [@problem_id:1722929]. By predicting changes in the phosphorylation of YAP, you will practice linking abstract pathway knowledge to tangible experimental readouts.", "problem": "The Hippo signaling pathway is a fundamental regulator of organ size and tissue homeostasis. A key component of this pathway is a kinase cascade involving the LATS kinases, which, when active, suppresses cell growth. The primary downstream target of this kinase cascade is the transcriptional co-activator known as Yes-associated protein (YAP). Phosphorylation of YAP by LATS kinases leads to its sequestration in the cytoplasm, preventing it from entering the nucleus and promoting the expression of pro-proliferative genes.\n\nA researcher is studying liver regeneration in a mouse model. One group of mice (Quiescent) is left untreated and serves as a control, representing a normal, non-proliferating liver. A second group of mice (Regenerating) undergoes a partial hepatectomy, a procedure that removes part of the liver and induces a strong proliferative response to restore the lost tissue mass. After 48 hours, liver tissue is collected from both groups and analyzed by Western blot to quantify the amount of YAP that is phosphorylated (p-YAP).\n\nBased on the described mechanism of the Hippo pathway, what is the most likely outcome when comparing the amount of p-YAP in the Regenerating liver tissue to the Quiescent liver tissue?\n\nA. The amount of p-YAP in the Regenerating liver will be significantly lower than in the Quiescent liver.\n\nB. The amount of p-YAP in the Regenerating liver will be significantly higher than in the Quiescent liver.\n\nC. The amount of p-YAP will not change between the two conditions, but the total amount of YAP protein will decrease in the Regenerating liver.\n\nD. Both p-YAP and total YAP will be completely absent in the Regenerating liver due to degradation.\n\nE. The amount of p-YAP will be identical to the total amount of YAP in the Regenerating liver.", "solution": "The Hippo signaling pathway restrains cell proliferation by activating a kinase cascade culminating in LATS kinase activity. Active LATS phosphorylates YAP. Phosphorylated YAP is sequestered in the cytoplasm and cannot enter the nucleus to co-activate transcription of pro-proliferative genes.\n\nIn a quiescent liver, tissue homeostasis is maintained; thus Hippo signaling is relatively active, leading to higher LATS activity and a higher fraction of YAP being phosphorylated. Consequently, the basal state should show relatively elevated p-YAP.\n\nPartial hepatectomy triggers liver regeneration, which requires induction of proliferation. To permit proliferation, the Hippo pathway is downregulated so that YAP can enter the nucleus and drive expression of growth-related genes. Mechanistically, this downregulation corresponds to reduced LATS activity, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of YAP and increased levels of dephosphorylated YAP that translocates to the nucleus.\n\nTherefore, when comparing Western blot signals for p-YAP between Regenerating and Quiescent liver, the Regenerating liver should exhibit a lower amount of p-YAP than the Quiescent liver.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A matches the predicted decrease in p-YAP during regeneration.\n- B contradicts the requirement of reduced YAP phosphorylation for nuclear entry and proliferation.\n- C lacks support; regeneration typically involves increased active (dephosphorylated) YAP rather than decreased total YAP.\n- D is incompatible with the need for YAP-driven transcription during regeneration.\n- E is incorrect because only a fraction of total YAP is phosphorylated, and regeneration favors the dephosphorylated pool.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is a significant decrease in p-YAP in the Regenerating liver relative to the Quiescent liver.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1722929"}, {"introduction": "Beyond qualitative predictions, biologists often use mathematical models to quantify the effects of genetic changes on development. This exercise asks you to model the consequences of unchecked YAP activity on liver growth over time [@problem_id:1722947]. By applying a simple exponential growth model, you can see how a molecular defect can lead to dramatic changes at the organ level.", "problem": "A developmental biologist is studying the Hippo signaling pathway, a key regulator of organ size, using a mouse model. In a healthy, mature adult mouse, the liver contains a stable population of $N_0 = 2.5 \\times 10^8$ hepatocytes. This steady-state population is maintained by a delicate balance between cell division and apoptosis (programmed cell death). The basal rate for both processes can be described by a rate constant $k_b = 0.004 \\text{ day}^{-1}$, meaning the total number of cells dividing per day is equal to the total number of cells undergoing apoptosis per day, each given by $k_b N_0$.\n\nThe biologist develops a transgenic mouse line in which a mutant form of the Yes-associated protein (YAP) can be expressed exclusively in liver cells. This mutant YAP lacks the phosphorylation sites targeted by the Large Tumor Suppressor (LATS) kinases, rendering it constitutively active. The transgene is induced in a mature adult mouse whose liver has already reached the stable size of $N_0$.\n\nThe constitutive activity of the mutant YAP has the following consequences on hepatocyte dynamics:\n1. The cellular division rate constant increases by a multiplicative factor $\\alpha = 12$.\n2. Apoptosis is completely suppressed, reducing the rate of cell death to zero.\n\nAssuming the liver is a closed system and its growth is solely determined by the net change in the number of hepatocytes, calculate the total number of hepatocytes in the transgenic mouse's liver after a time period of $T = 40$ days has elapsed since the induction of the mutant YAP.

Let $N(t)$ be the number of hepatocytes at time $t$ (in days). In the healthy steady state, division and apoptosis occur at rates $k_{b}N$ and $k_{b}N$, respectively, yielding no net change.
