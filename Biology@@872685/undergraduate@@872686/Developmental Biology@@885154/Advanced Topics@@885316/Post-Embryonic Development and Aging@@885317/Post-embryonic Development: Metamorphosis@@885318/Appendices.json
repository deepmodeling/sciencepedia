{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The timing of metamorphosis is one of the most critical decisions in an insect's life, and it is governed by a delicate hormonal dance. This thought experiment, based on classic early 20th-century research, allows us to dissect the role of one of the key players: Juvenile Hormone (JH). By hypothetically removing the source of JH, we can isolate its function and understand how its presence or absence directs the outcome of a molt, providing a foundational understanding of insect development [@problem_id:1708741].", "problem": "In holometabolous insects, such as moths and butterflies, post-embryonic development is controlled by two primary hormones. Ecdysone, secreted by the prothoracic gland, triggers molting (ecdysis). Juvenile Hormone (JH), secreted by a pair of glands called the corpora allata, determines the outcome of the molt. When JH levels are high, a molt results in a larger larval instar. When JH levels fall below a critical threshold, a molt leads to pupation, and a subsequent molt in the complete absence of JH leads to the emergence of the adult.\n\nConsider a species of moth that normally undergoes five larval instars before pupating. A group of researchers performs a delicate surgery on a healthy, well-fed second-instar larva, completely removing its corpora allata. This procedure is known as allatectomy. Assuming the larva survives the surgery and continues to have access to sufficient food, which of the following outcomes most accurately describes the subsequent life history of this manipulated insect?\n\nA. It will molt prematurely into a miniature pupa, which will then molt into a miniature adult.\n\nB. It will die almost immediately, as Juvenile Hormone is required for basic metabolic functions.\n\nC. It will continue to grow and molt through the third, fourth, and fifth larval instars, but will then be unable to pupate and will die as a giant larva.\n\nD. It will molt directly from a larva into a miniature adult, completely skipping the pupal stage.\n\nE. It will become permanently arrested as a second-instar larva, unable to initiate any further molts.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the developmental fate of a second-instar larva after its corpora allata are surgically removed. To solve this, we must understand the specific roles of the two key hormones involved in insect metamorphosis: ecdysone and Juvenile Hormone (JH).\n\nStep 1: Analyze the function of each hormone.\n- **Ecdysone**: This hormone is often called the \"molting hormone.\" Its release in pulses from the prothoracic gland triggers the process of ecdysis, or molting, where the insect sheds its old cuticle and grows a new one. The presence of ecdysone is necessary for any molt to occur.\n- **Juvenile Hormone (JH)**: This hormone's primary role is to determine the *character* of the molt initiated by ecdysone. Its name is descriptive: it promotes the retention of juvenile, or larval, characteristics.\n    - When JH levels in the hemolymph (insect blood) are high, an ecdysone-induced molt results in another larval instar (a larva-to-larva molt).\n    - When JH levels drop significantly, an ecdysone-induced molt triggers metamorphosis, leading to the formation of a pupa (a larva-to-pupa molt).\n    - When a molt occurs in the complete absence of JH, it results in the formation of the adult (a pupa-to-adult molt).\n\nStep 2: Determine the effect of removing the corpora allata.\nThe corpora allata are the sole glands responsible for producing and secreting JH. Surgically removing them (allatectomy) will cause the concentration of JH in the larva's hemolymph to plummet to nearly zero.\n\nStep 3: Predict the outcome of the next molt.\nThe larva is in its second instar. Under normal conditions, it would continue to produce high levels of JH and molt into a third-instar larva, then a fourth, and so on. However, in our experimental larva, the JH source has been removed. The prothoracic gland is unaffected, so it will continue to produce ecdysone at the appropriate time to trigger the next molt. When this pulse of ecdysone occurs in the now JH-deficient larva, the developmental program will interpret the signal as \"time to metamorphose.\" Instead of molting into a third-instar larva, the second-instar larva will undergo a precocious (premature) pupation. Because the larva has only grown to the size of a second instar, the resulting pupa will be a miniature version of a normal pupa.\n\nStep 4: Predict the outcome of a subsequent molt.\nThe insect is now a miniature pupa. The corpora allata are still absent, so JH levels remain at zero. The developmental cycle will continue, and another pulse of ecdysone will trigger the next molt. A molt that occurs in the complete absence of JH results in the formation of an adult. Therefore, the miniature pupa will molt into a miniature adult. This adult will be correctly formed but much smaller than usual and likely sterile or non-viable due to its accelerated and incomplete growth phase.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options based on this prediction.\n- **A. It will molt prematurely into a miniature pupa, which will then molt into a miniature adult.** This matches our prediction perfectly. The lack of JH induces premature metamorphosis.\n- **B. It will die almost immediately, as Juvenile Hormone is required for basic metabolic functions.** This is incorrect. While JH has some metabolic roles, its primary function is developmental. Its absence does not cause immediate death but rather alters the developmental pathway.\n- **C. It will continue to grow and molt through the third, fourth, and fifth larval instars, but will then be unable to pupate and will die as a giant larva.** This describes the opposite scenario: what would happen if JH levels were artificially kept high, preventing the drop in JH concentration needed for pupation.\n- **D. It will molt directly from a larva into a miniature adult, completely skipping the pupal stage.** This is incorrect for holometabolous insects like moths. The pupal stage is a necessary developmental period during which the larval body is completely reorganized into the adult form. This transformation cannot be skipped.\n- **E. It will become permanently arrested as a second-instar larva, unable to initiate any further molts.** This is incorrect. The inability to molt would imply a lack of ecdysone. The surgery removed the corpora allata (source of JH), not the prothoracic gland (source of ecdysone).\n\nTherefore, the correct prediction is that the allatectomized larva will molt into a miniature pupa and then a miniature adult.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1708741"}, {"introduction": "While hormones act as system-wide signals, metamorphosis is ultimately a local process of tissue construction. This practice explores the remarkable properties of imaginal discs—the embryonic tissues that build the adult fly—through a classic transplantation experiment [@problem_id:1708700]. By moving these discs between different hormonal environments, we can uncover the core principles of developmental *determination* and *regulation*, revealing how a small fragment of tissue can grow and regenerate into a complete, complex structure like a leg.", "problem": "An experiment is conducted to investigate the developmental potential and hormonal regulation of imaginal discs in the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*. An imaginal leg disc, which is a small epithelial sac of cells determined to form a leg during metamorphosis, is surgically removed from a late third-instar larva. This larval stage is the final one before the onset of pupation.\n\nThe dissected leg disc is carefully cut into four small fragments. Each fragment is then individually transplanted into the abdominal cavity of a separate adult female fly. These adult flies serve as living culture environments and are maintained for several weeks. During this period, the transplanted fragments are observed to increase significantly in size.\n\nFollowing this culture period, each of the four now-enlarged tissue masses is recovered from its host. Each tissue mass is then transplanted into the abdomen of a new, different late third-instar larva (one tissue mass per larva). These four recipient larvae are subsequently allowed to proceed through their natural life cycle, undergoing metamorphosis into pupae and then eclosing as adult flies.\n\nAssuming all surgical procedures are successful and the transplanted tissues remain viable, which of the following outcomes would be predominantly observed upon examining the abdominal cavities of the four final adult flies that developed from the recipient larvae?\n\nA. The abdominal cavities are empty, as the disc fragments were unable to develop outside their original larval context.\n\nB. Four amorphous, tumor-like masses of undifferentiated cells are found, one in each abdomen.\n\nC. Four sets of partial leg structures are found, with each set corresponding to the specific portion of the original disc from which the fragment was cut.\n\nD. Four complete and well-patterned legs are found, one supernumerary leg within the abdomen of each of the four flies.\n\nE. A single, complete leg is found in the abdomen of one of the four flies, while the other three contain no differentiated structures.", "solution": "We begin by stating key developmental principles about Drosophila imaginal discs. Imaginal discs are groups of epithelial cells that are determined for a specific adult fate (such as leg) during larval life. Determination means their fate is fixed (leg-forming), but they are undifferentiated until metamorphic cues trigger differentiation. Importantly, imaginal discs exhibit regulative growth and patterning: even small fragments can regenerate the missing parts of the disc via intercalary regeneration to reestablish a complete, correctly patterned field corresponding to the original structure.\n\nNext, we consider hormonal control. Metamorphic differentiation of imaginal discs requires pulses of ecdysteroids (notably ecdysone), which occur at the larval-to-pupal transition and during pupation. In contrast, the hemolymph environment of an adult host supports growth and survival of imaginal disc cells but does not provide the metamorphic ecdysteroid pulses needed to induce differentiation.\n\nNow we apply these principles to the experiment. The leg imaginal disc is cut into four fragments. Each fragment is transplanted into an adult abdomen and maintained. In the adult host, each fragment grows substantially (mitotic proliferation) but does not differentiate, because the required ecdysone pulses are absent in this context. During this growth period, each fragment also undergoes regulative patterning, restoring the missing positional values through intercalary regeneration, thereby reconstructing a complete leg-disc pattern within each mass of tissue.\n\nEach enlarged tissue mass is then transplanted into a late third-instar larva that proceeds to pupation. During the larva-to-pupa transition and pupal development, the endogenous ecdysteroid pulses occur. These hormonal cues are sufficient to trigger the determined leg-disc tissues to undergo metamorphic differentiation into the adult leg structures, even at an ectopic location (the abdominal cavity). Because imaginal discs are largely autonomous with respect to pattern and identity once determined, they will form their specified structure at the site where they reside, irrespective of position in the body.\n\nTherefore, for each of the four recipients, the transplanted, regenerated leg disc will differentiate into a complete, well-patterned leg inside the abdomen. Consequently, the expected predominant outcome is that each of the four final adult flies contains an ectopic but complete leg in the abdomen.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: the fragments are viable, grow in adults, and later differentiate after exposure to pupal hormones.\n- B is incorrect: under pupal ecdysteroid pulses, imaginal disc tissue differentiates into proper structures rather than remaining undifferentiated.\n- C is incorrect: due to regulative growth and intercalary regeneration, fragments reconstruct complete discs; they do not remain as partial patterns corresponding only to the piece excised.\n- D is correct: each fragment yields a complete leg, producing four supernumerary legs, one per recipient fly.\n- E is incorrect: given viability and regulation, all four are expected to form complete legs, not just one.\n\nThus, the experimentally supported outcome is four complete legs, one in each abdomen.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1708700"}, {"introduction": "The dramatic transformation from larva to adult is not just a change in form; it is an energetically expensive process fueled by stored resources.
