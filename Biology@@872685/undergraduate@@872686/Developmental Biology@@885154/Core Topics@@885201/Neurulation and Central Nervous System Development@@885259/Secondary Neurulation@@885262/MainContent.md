## Introduction
The formation of the central nervous system is a cornerstone of vertebrate [embryogenesis](@entry_id:154867), yet the neural tube is not built by a single, uniform mechanism. While most are familiar with the elegant folding of the neural plate in [primary neurulation](@entry_id:183324), the posterior-most portion of the spinal cord is constructed through a distinct and fascinating process: secondary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036). This article delves into this alternative strategy, addressing how a solid mass of progenitor cells transforms into a complex, functional neural structure. Understanding this process is critical, as its failure leads to specific congenital disorders, and its principles provide a blueprint for regeneration and a window into [vertebrate evolution](@entry_id:145018).

This article will guide you through the intricacies of secondary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036) across three chapters. First, in **"Principles and Mechanisms,"** we will dissect the cellular and molecular choreography of tube formation, from the unique [neuromesodermal progenitors](@entry_id:195077) to the establishment of a hollow [lumen](@entry_id:173725). Next, **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections"** will explore the profound relevance of this process, connecting its fundamental biology to human pathologies like [tethered cord syndrome](@entry_id:273137), the remarkable phenomenon of [spinal cord regeneration](@entry_id:263146), and the evolution of the [vertebrate body plan](@entry_id:191622). Finally, **"Hands-On Practices"** will provide an opportunity to solidify your understanding by actively engaging with the core concepts of progenitor [ablation](@entry_id:153309), cellular transitions, and the [gene regulatory networks](@entry_id:150976) that orchestrate cell fate.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The formation of the central nervous system is one of the foundational events in vertebrate [embryogenesis](@entry_id:154867). While the anterior structures, including the brain and the majority of the spinal cord, are formed by a well-known process of epithelial folding called [primary neurulation](@entry_id:183324), the posterior-most regions of the spinal cord arise through a fundamentally different set of cellular and molecular events. This latter process, known as **secondary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036)**, is responsible for constructing the sacral and coccygeal (tail) portions of the neural tube. This chapter elucidates the core principles and mechanisms that govern secondary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036), from the unique progenitor cells that initiate the process to the intricate cellular choreography that builds the final structure, and the genetic programs that pattern its identity.

### A Tale of Two Neurulations: Distinct Origins and Morphologies

The vertebrate body axis is built sequentially, and the mechanisms employed to form the neural tube differ profoundly between the anterior and posterior regions. Understanding secondary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036) begins with contrasting it against its more familiar counterpart, [primary neurulation](@entry_id:183324).

Primary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036) begins with the **neural plate**, a thickened sheet of pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells derived from the embryonic **[ectoderm](@entry_id:140339)**. This plate, induced by signals from the underlying [notochord](@entry_id:260635) and [paraxial mesoderm](@entry_id:203589), undergoes a dramatic morphogenetic process. It bends at specific locations called hinge points, elevates its lateral edges as **neural folds**, and ultimately fuses along the dorsal midline to enclose a [lumen](@entry_id:173725), forming a hollow tube. This process is, in essence, the folding and sealing of a pre-existing epithelial sheet.

In stark contrast, secondary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036) does not begin with an epithelial sheet. Instead, its precursor is the **caudal cell mass (CCM)**, also known as the **tail bud**, a condensation of **mesenchymal** cells at the posterior end of the embryo [@problem_id:1713126]. Unlike the purely ectodermal neural plate, the caudal cell mass is a more heterogeneous population with a significant mesodermal character. It is largely derived from a unique population of bipotent progenitors known as **[neuromesodermal progenitors](@entry_id:195077) (NMPs)**. These remarkable cells, co-expressing the neural progenitor marker *Sox2* and the nascent mesoderm marker *T(Brachyury)*, reside in the caudal-most growth zone and contribute to both the posterior neural tube and the adjacent [paraxial mesoderm](@entry_id:203589) (which forms the [somites](@entry_id:187163)) [@problem_id:2669714] [@problem_id:1713143].

The morphogenetic mechanism of secondary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036) is also fundamentally different. It involves the aggregation of these mesenchymal cells to form a solid cord, which then undergoes **[cavitation](@entry_id:139719)** (or [canalization](@entry_id:148035)) to form a central [lumen](@entry_id:173725). There is no folding of a surface epithelium.

This transition from primary to secondary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036) occurs at a specific point along the anteroposterior axis, known as the "transition zone". The precise location varies among species. In the [chick embryo](@entry_id:262176), this switch occurs around the lumbosacral level, caudal to approximately somite 27, beginning around Hamburger-Hamilton (HH) stage 17-18. In the mouse, the transition is located at the sacral boundary, near somite 31-35, initiating around embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) as the posterior neuropore closes [@problem_id:2669714].

### The Cellular Choreography of Tube Formation

The transformation of a loose collection of mesenchymal cells into a hollow, patterned epithelial tube is a masterpiece of cellular [self-organization](@entry_id:186805). This process can be dissected into a sequence of discrete, coordinated steps.

#### Condensation and the Mesenchymal-to-Epithelial Transition (MET)

The first step in secondary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036) is the [condensation](@entry_id:148670) of the dispersed mesenchymal cells of the caudal cell mass into a dense, solid rod known as the **[medullary cord](@entry_id:181221)**. This aggregation is not a passive process but an active transformation of cellular identity, a classic example of a **[mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition](@entry_id:265165) (MET)** [@problem_id:1713105]. Mesenchymal cells are typically characterized by their loose connections and migratory potential. During MET, they relinquish these properties to become tightly associated, stationary epithelial cells.

This transition is driven by a significant upregulation of [cell adhesion molecules](@entry_id:169310) on the cell surface. Key players in this process are **N-cadherin** and the **Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (NCAM)**. These proteins mediate homophilic binding—that is, they bind to identical molecules on adjacent cells—physically drawing the cells together and promoting the formation of a cohesive, solid structure. This increase in intercellular adhesion is the molecular engine of [medullary cord](@entry_id:181221) [condensation](@entry_id:148670) [@problem_id:1713120].

#### Establishing Polarity and Assembling the Epithelium

Once the [medullary cord](@entry_id:181221) has condensed, its cells must organize into a proper epithelium, a process that hinges on the establishment of **apico-basal polarity**. This polarity defines a "top" (apical) and "bottom" (basal) for each cell, which is essential for forming a lumen and creating a functional barrier.

The establishment of polarity begins with external cues. The cells on the periphery of the [medullary cord](@entry_id:181221) secrete and assemble a **basement membrane**, a specialized sheet of extracellular matrix rich in proteins like laminin. These peripheral cells then engage the basement membrane using **integrin** receptors, which firmly anchors their basal surfaces and defines the outer boundary of the nascent tube [@problem_id:2669715].

With the basal side defined, the opposite, interior-facing surface of the cells is designated as the apical domain. This is orchestrated by the recruitment and localization of intracellular protein complexes that specify apical identity, such as the **Par (Par3/Par6/aPKC)** and **Crumbs** complexes. Following the establishment of this axis, stable **junctional complexes** assemble at the apicolateral boundary between cells. These include **[adherens junctions](@entry_id:148890)**, which provide strong mechanical adhesion, and **tight junctions**, which form a seal that prevents leakage between cells. This completes the MET, transforming the solid mesenchymal cord into a solid rod of polarized epithelial cells [@problem_id:1713105] [@problem_id:2669715].

#### Lumenogenesis: Hollowing the Medullary Cord

The final architectural challenge is to create a central [lumen](@entry_id:173725) within the solid, epithelialized [medullary cord](@entry_id:181221). This process, known as **[cavitation](@entry_id:139719)** or **cord hollowing**, occurs not through widespread [cell death](@entry_id:169213) but through a sophisticated process of de novo lumen formation and [coalescence](@entry_id:147963).

The process is often initiated by the formation of **multicellular rosettes**. Here, groups of cells undergo coordinated **[apical constriction](@entry_id:272311)**, a contraction of their apical (central-facing) domain driven by an actomyosin network regulated by the **Rho-ROCK signaling pathway**. This pulls the apical surfaces of several cells into a single [focal point](@entry_id:174388), creating a rosette-like structure in cross-section. At these apical foci, multiple small, non-contiguous lumens—**microlumens**—begin to appear. Their formation is driven by targeted [vesicular trafficking](@entry_id:154407), which delivers new apical membrane components to these sites, and the secretion of anti-adhesive [glycoproteins](@entry_id:171189) into the nascent space to prevent it from collapsing [@problem_id:2669715].

The final step is the creation of a single, continuous central canal from these scattered microlumens. This is accomplished through the remarkable process of **[cell intercalation](@entry_id:186323)**. The cells forming the partitions between adjacent microlumens actively rearrange themselves, moving out of the way to allow the small cavities to merge. This [coalescence](@entry_id:147963) proceeds along the length of the [medullary cord](@entry_id:181221) until a single, patent lumen is formed, which then becomes continuous with the central canal formed during [primary neurulation](@entry_id:183324) [@problem_id:1713116].

### Regulation and Patterning of the Posterior Neural Tube

The formation of the secondary neural tube is not an isolated event. Its growth must be sustained by a progenitor pool, and its structure must be patterned to generate the correct types and arrangements of neurons for a functional spinal cord.

#### Maintaining the Progenitor Pool: The FGF Signaling Axis

Posterior body elongation and secondary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036) are dependent on the persistence of the caudal cell mass, which serves as a reservoir of undifferentiated, proliferative progenitor cells. The maintenance of this progenitor state is actively regulated by a balance of signaling molecules. High levels of **Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF)** and **Wnt** signaling in the tail bud are crucial for promoting proliferation and preventing premature differentiation.

The importance of FGF signaling can be illustrated with a thought experiment. If an inhibitor were used to block FGF receptor activity specifically in the tail bud just as secondary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036) begins, the most direct consequence would not be cell death or a failure of morphogenesis. Instead, the progenitor cells would lose the signal telling them to remain as progenitors. They would prematurely exit the cell cycle and differentiate, primarily into neural cells. This would rapidly exhaust the progenitor pool, halting the posterior extension of the body axis and resulting in a severely truncated tail. This demonstrates that FGF signaling is a critical regulator that maintains the progenitor source for secondary [neurulation](@entry_id:187036) [@problem_id:1713093].

#### Specifying Cell Fates: Dorsoventral Patterning by Shh

Once formed, the secondary neural tube is a blank slate that must be patterned to establish its complex [neuroanatomy](@entry_id:150634). A primary axis of patterning is the dorsoventral (back-to-belly) axis, which segregates different classes of neurons, such as motor neurons ventrally and sensory interneurons more dorsally.

This patterning is orchestrated by **[morphogens](@entry_id:149113)**—secreted signaling molecules that form concentration gradients. A classic example is **Sonic hedgehog (Shh)**, which is secreted from the **notochord** lying directly ventral to the neural tube. Shh protein diffuses away from the notochord, establishing a high-to-low [concentration gradient](@entry_id:136633) across the ventral half of the tube. Cells at different positions along this gradient are exposed to different concentrations of Shh. They interpret these quantitative differences by activating unique combinations of transcription factors. For example, the highest concentration of Shh induces one set of transcription factors, while slightly lower concentrations induce a different set. This differential gene activation establishes discrete progenitor domains along the dorsoventral axis, each of which will go on to generate a specific type of ventral neuron (e.g., motor neurons, V0-V3 interneurons) in its correct spatial location [@problem_id:1713136].

#### Assigning Regional Identity: The Hox Code and Posterior Prevalence

Finally, the secondary neural tube must be imbued with a regional identity along the anteroposterior axis. A neuron in the sacral region must be functionally distinct from one in the tail, even if they are of the same class (e.g., motor neurons). This regional specification is the domain of the **Hox genes**, a family of master regulatory transcription factors.

Different combinations of Hox genes are expressed in overlapping domains along the axis, creating a "Hox code" that specifies regional identity. For instance, in many amniotes, genes of the **Hox11 paralog group** are critical for conferring sacral identity, while the more posteriorly expressed **Hox13 paralog group** genes specify coccygeal (tail) identity.

The function of these genes follows a hierarchical rule known as **[posterior prevalence](@entry_id:150107)** (or posterior dominance). This principle states that the Hox genes expressed in a more posterior region tend to functionally override the Hox genes of a more anterior region. We can see this in an experimental context: if a *Hox13* gene were ectopically expressed throughout the entire caudal eminence, including the region that would normally form sacral structures, the *Hox13* protein would override the function of the endogenous *Hox11* genes. This would result in a **[homeotic transformation](@entry_id:271415)**, where the prospective sacral region adopts the characteristics of the tail. This elegant genetic system ensures that as the body axis extends, each new segment is assigned its proper identity [@problem_id:1713088].
