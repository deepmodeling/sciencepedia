The timing of this process is governed by an oscillatory genetic network known as the segmentation clock. The period of this clock dictates the time it takes for one pair of somites to form.\n\nA developmental biologist is studying somitogenesis in a chick embryo. Under a standard incubation temperature of 38.0°C, the segmentation clock has a period that results in the formation of one new pair of somites every 90.0 minutes.\n\nThe biologist conducts a temperature-shift experiment. The embryo is first incubated for 4.50 hours at 38.0°C. Subsequently, the incubation temperature is lowered, which causes all metabolic processes to slow down. At this new, lower temperature, the period of the segmentation clock increases by a factor of 1.60.

In this model, the periodic formation of somites is governed by an internal cellular oscillator (the clock) and a posterior-to-anterior gradient of a signaling molecule (the wavefront).\n\nThe Presomitic Mesoderm (PSM) is aligned along a coordinate $x$, where $x=0$ represents the boundary of the most recently formed somite. The concentration of a signaling molecule $M$ within the PSM is described by an exponential decay function: $C(x) = C_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, where $C_0$ is the concentration at the posterior end of the organism and $\\lambda$ is the characteristic decay length of the gradient.\n\nThe \"wavefront\" is defined as the position, $x_{\\text{wf}}$, where the concentration $C(x)$ drops to a fixed critical threshold, $C_{\\text{crit}}$. According to the model, a new somite boundary is formed at this position. The length of a newly formed somite is therefore equal to the position of the wavefront, $x_{\\text{wf}}$, at the moment of segmentation.\n\nInitially, the embryo is in a steady state, forming somites of a constant length $S_0 = 55.0$ micrometers. The signaling gradient in this initial state is characterized by a decay length $\\lambda_0 = 120.0$ micrometers.\n\nAt time $t=0$, an inhibitor is introduced that affects the stability of molecule $M$. This instantly changes the characteristic decay length of the gradient to a new value, $\\lambda_1 = 90.0$ micrometers. Assume that this change does not affect the values of $C_0$ or $C_{\\text{crit}}$.\n\nCalculate the length of the first new somite that will form completely after the inhibitor is added. Express your answer in micrometers, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the length of the first somite formed after a change in the decay length of the signaling molecule gradient.\n\nAccording to the model described in the problem statement, the length of a newly formed somite, $S$, is equal to the position of the wavefront, $x_{\\text{wf}}$. The wavefront position is where the concentration of the signaling molecule, $C(x)$, equals a critical threshold, $C_{\\text{crit}}$.\n\nThe concentration profile is given by $C(x) = C_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$.\nTherefore, the wavefront condition is:\n$$C_{\\text{crit}} = C_0 \\exp(-x_{\\text{wf}}/\\lambda)$$\nSince the somite length $S = x_{\\text{wf}}$, we can write:\n$$C_{\\text{crit}} = C_0 \\exp(-S/\\lambda)$$\n\nFirst, let's analyze the initial steady state before the inhibitor is added. The somite length is $S_0 = 55.0$ micrometers, and the decay length is $\\lambda_0 = 120.0$ micrometers. Plugging these into our equation gives a relationship for the critical concentration $C_{\\text{crit}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{crit}} = C_0 \\exp(-S_0/\\lambda_0)$$\nThis equation captures the state of the system initially. The values of $C_0$ and $C_{\\text{crit}}$ are constant properties of the system.\n\nNext, we analyze the situation immediately after the inhibitor is added. The decay length changes to $\\lambda_1 = 90.0$ micrometers. The problem states that $C_0$ and $C_{\\text{crit}}$ remain unchanged. The length of the first somite to form after this change, which we will call $S_1$, will be determined by the new wavefront position, $x_{\\text{wf},1}$. The wavefront is still defined by the same critical concentration threshold. Therefore, we can write:\n$$C_{\\text{crit}} = C_0 \\exp(-S_1/\\lambda_1)$$\n\nNow we have two expressions for the same constant, $C_{\\text{crit}}$. We can set them equal to each other:\n$$C_0 \\exp(-S_0/\\lambda_0) = C_0 \\exp(-S_1/\\lambda_1)$$\n\nWe can cancel $C_0$ from both sides:\n$$\\exp(-S_0/\\lambda_0) = \\exp(-S_1/\\lambda_1)$$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$-\\frac{S_0}{\\lambda_0} = -\\frac{S_1}{\\lambda_1}$$\n\nWe can solve this equation for the new somite length, $S_1$:\n$$S_1 = S_0 \\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_0}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$S_0 = 55.0$ micrometers\n$\\lambda_0 = 120.0$ micrometers\n$\\lambda_1 = 90.0$ micrometers\n\n$$S_1 = (55.0 \\, \\text{micrometers}) \\times \\frac{90.0 \\, \\text{micrometers}}{120.0 \\, \\text{micrometers}}$$\n$$S_1 = 55.0 \\times \\frac{90.0}{120.0} = 55.0 \\times 0.75$$\n$$S_1 = 41.25 \\, \\text{micrometers}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$S_1 \\approx 41.3 \\, \\text{micrometers}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{41.3}$$", "id": "1720082"}, {"introduction": "The Clock and Wavefront model is powerful because it integrates two distinct processes. This final practice [@problem_id:1720118] is a conceptual thought experiment designed to test your understanding of this essential partnership. By considering a hypothetical scenario where the wavefront is artificially stopped while the clock continues to tick, you can deduce the absolute necessity of their interaction for segmentation to proceed.", "problem": "In vertebrate development, the sequential formation of somites from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) is governed by a mechanism known as the \"Clock and Wavefront\" model. This model involves two key components:\n1.  A molecular \"clock\" that oscillates within the cells of the PSM, providing temporal periodicity.\n2.  A \"wavefront\" of developmental competence that slowly retreats from the posterior to the anterior end of the embryo as the axis elongates. This wavefront is established by a gradient of a signaling molecule, such as Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), which is high in the posterior and low in the anterior. A new somite boundary is determined when cells at the anterior edge of the PSM, having passed through a certain number of clock cycles, experience the FGF concentration dropping below a critical threshold as the wavefront passes over them.\n\nConsider a developing chick embryo that is briefly exposed to a novel experimental drug. This drug has a very specific effect: it completely and instantaneously halts the posterior-to-anterior retreat of the FGF wavefront for the duration of the exposure. The drug has no other effects; specifically, it does not interfere with the molecular clock, which continues to oscillate normally in all PSM cells.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the most immediate and direct consequence for somite formation **during the period of drug exposure**?\n\nA. Somite formation ceases entirely.\n\nB. Somites form, but at a significantly slower rate than normal.\n\nC. A single, abnormally large somite is formed at the location of the stalled wavefront.\n\nD. Smaller and more numerous somites are formed.\n\nE. Somite formation proceeds normally, as the molecular clock is unaffected.", "solution": "Let's analyze this using the Clock and Wavefront model's principles.\n\n1.  **Normal Condition:** A new somite boundary forms where and when two conditions are met: (i) cells are at the correct phase of their molecular clock cycle, and (ii) those cells cross the wavefront, meaning the local FGF concentration drops below the critical threshold, $C_{\\text{crit}}$. The wavefront is constantly retreating, allowing new groups of cells to meet this second condition periodically.\n\n2.  **Drug-Exposed Condition:** The drug halts the retreat of the wavefront. This means the position where the FGF concentration equals $C_{\\text{crit}}$ becomes fixed in place. No new cells will cross this threshold.\n\n3.  **Consequence:** Although the clock continues to tick in all PSM cells (satisfying condition i), the second condition (crossing the wavefront) can no longer be met for any new cells. A new somite cannot be formed because there is no new location specified for its boundary. The process of defining sequential segments is arrested.\n\nThe relationship for somite length, $L = vT$ (where $v$ is wavefront velocity and $T$ is clock period), also illustrates this. If the wavefront velocity $v$ becomes zero, the length of any new somite would be $L = 0 \\times T = 0$. This indicates that no new segment of non-zero length can be formed.\n\nTherefore, somite formation ceases entirely during the drug exposure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1720118"}]}
