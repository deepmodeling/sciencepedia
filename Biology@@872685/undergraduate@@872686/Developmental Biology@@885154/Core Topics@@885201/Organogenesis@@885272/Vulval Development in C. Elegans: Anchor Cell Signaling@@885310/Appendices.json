This first exercise utilizes a temperature-sensitive mutation, a powerful tool for geneticists, to probe the essential role of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) in transmitting the inductive signal for vulval fate specification [@problem_id:1731989]. By analyzing the different outcomes at permissive and restrictive temperatures, you can directly infer the protein's importance in the pathway.", "problem": "In the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*, the development of the vulva is a classic model for understanding intercellular signaling. The process is initiated by a single cell, the Anchor Cell (AC), which secretes an inductive signal, a protein of the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) family. This signal is received by neighboring Vulval Precursor Cells (VPCs), which transduce the signal internally through a Ras/Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade. Proper activation of this cascade is essential for the VPCs to adopt primary (1°) and secondary (2°) vulval fates. If this signaling is absent or blocked, the VPCs adopt a default tertiary (3°) fate, becoming part of the skin, which results in a \"Vulvaless\" phenotype where no vulva is formed.\n\nAn investigator is studying a *C. elegans* strain that has a temperature-sensitive point mutation in the *mpk-1* gene, which encodes the central MAPK protein of this pathway. When the worms are raised at a permissive temperature of $15^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, they develop a normal vulva. However, when raised at a restrictive temperature of $25^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, they are all Vulvaless.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and direct explanation for this temperature-dependent observation?\n\nA. At $25^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, the Anchor Cell is unstable and cannot produce the EGF inductive signal, while at $15^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, it functions normally.\nB. At $25^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, the mutant MPK-1 protein is hyperactive, causing the VPCs to adopt the 3° fate through negative feedback.\nC. At $25^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, the transcription of the *mpk-1* gene is inhibited, so no MPK-1 protein is produced in the VPCs.\nD. At $25^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, the mutant MPK-1 protein is misfolded and non-functional, preventing the VPCs from responding to the inductive signal and causing them to adopt the default 3° fate.\nE. At $25^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, the VPCs fail to migrate to the correct position and are therefore too far from the Anchor Cell to receive the inductive signal.", "solution": "The phenotype described is classic for a temperature-sensitive loss-of-function allele in a signaling pathway component. A temperature-sensitive mutation typically yields a protein that folds into a functional conformation at a permissive temperature and becomes unstable or misfolded at a restrictive temperature. The gene in question, *mpk-1*, encodes the MAPK ortholog that is essential in the Ras/MAPK cascade downstream of the Anchor Cell’s EGF signal. In the VPCs, MAPK activity is required to transduce the inductive cue and specify $1^{\\circ}$ and $2^{\\circ}$ vulval fates; without MAPK function, VPCs default to the $3^{\\circ}$ fate, producing a Vulvaless phenotype.\n\nAt $15^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ (permissive), the mutant MPK-1 protein retains proper folding and function, allowing normal signaling and vulval development. At $25^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ (restrictive), the mutant protein becomes misfolded and non-functional, blocking the cascade even though the inductive EGF signal is present, so VPCs adopt the default $3^{\\circ}$ fate and no vulva forms. This directly corresponds to choice D.\n\nWhy the other options are not correct:\n- A incorrectly attributes the defect to the Anchor Cell’s ability to produce EGF. The mutation is in *mpk-1* and thus specifically affects the response to the signal in VPCs, not the production of the signal by the Anchor Cell.\n- B proposes hyperactivity of MPK-1 at $25^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, which would be expected to increase induction and could cause a Multivulva phenotype, not a Vulvaless phenotype. The observed phenotype is consistent with loss, not gain, of function.\n- C suggests transcriptional inhibition of *mpk-1* at high temperature. Temperature-sensitive alleles classically affect protein folding/stability or activity, not gene transcription, and the allele is described as a point mutation in the coding gene, not a regulatory change.\n- E invokes VPC migration failure; however, VPCs do not rely on large-scale migration to receive the AC signal for vulval induction. The core defect here is in signal transduction within VPCs due to loss of MPK-1 function, not spatial positioning relative to the AC.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and direct explanation is that at the restrictive temperature the mutant MAPK protein is misfolded and non-functional, preventing VPCs from transducing the EGF signal and causing default $3^{\\circ}$ fates.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1731989"}, {"introduction": "Biological pathways are like assembly lines, with each protein performing a specific step in a defined sequence.

By predicting the phenotype of a worm with both a hyperactive Ras protein (LET-60) and a non-functional MAPK protein (MPK-1), you can logically deduce their functional relationship within the signaling cascade.", "problem": "In the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*, the development of the vulva is a classic model for understanding intercellular signaling. Six Vulval Precursor Cells (VPCs) on the ventral side of the hermaphrodite can adopt one of three fates. The primary (1°) and secondary (2°) fates contribute to the formation of the vulva, while the tertiary (3°) fate results in the cell becoming part of the surrounding skin (hypodermis). A normal vulva requires a specific combination of 1° and 2° cell fates. If all VPCs adopt the 3° fate, no vulva is formed, a phenotype known as **Vulvaless (Vul)**. If too many VPCs adopt 1° or 2° fates, multiple pseudo-vulvas are formed, a phenotype called **Multivulva (Muv)**.\n\nThis fate decision is controlled by a signal transduction pathway. Two key proteins in this pathway are LET-60, a Ras GTPase, and MPK-1, a Mitogen-Activated Protein (MAP) Kinase. In the wild-type pathway, the activation of LET-60 is a necessary preceding step for the activation of MPK-1, which in turn promotes the 1° and 2° vulval fates.\n\nExperiments have characterized the phenotypes of single mutations:\n1.  A gain-of-function mutation in the *let-60* gene produces a constitutively active LET-60 protein that is always signaling, regardless of upstream cues. Worms with this mutation exhibit the Muv phenotype.\n2.  A loss-of-function mutation in the *mpk-1* gene produces a non-functional MPK-1 protein. Worms with this mutation exhibit the Vul phenotype.\n\nConsider a geneticist who creates a double-mutant worm that possesses both the constitutively active *let-60* allele and the non-functional *mpk-1* allele.

Excess pathway output yields the Muv phenotype, while absent output yields the Vul phenotype.\n\nFor the single mutants:\n- Constitutively active *let-60(gf)* sets LET-60 to an active state independent of upstream cues, which in a wild-type downstream context drives MPK-1 activation and produces Muv.\n- Loss-of-function *mpk-1(lf)* sets MPK-1 to a nonfunctional state, abolishing pathway output and producing Vul.\n\nFor the double mutant *let-60(gf) ; mpk-1(lf)*, the upstream component LET-60 is active, but the downstream effector MPK-1 is nonfunctional. Since the output that specifies $1^{\\circ}$/$2^{\\circ}$ fates requires MPK-1 activity, the absence of functional MPK-1 blocks signaling to the fate decision regardless of LET-60 status:\n$$MPK-1 \\text{ is non-functional} \\implies \\text{no activation of }1^{\\circ}/2^{\\circ}\\text{ fates} \\implies \\text{Vul}.$$\nThus the downstream loss-of-function is epistatic to the upstream gain-of-function, and the double mutant exhibits the Vul phenotype.\n\nThe correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1731994"}, {"introduction": "Proper development requires not only turning genes on at the right time and place but also actively keeping them off where they are not needed. This exercise explores this crucial concept of negative regulation by introducing the synthetic Multivulva (synMuv) genes, which act as a brake on the Ras signaling pathway [@problem_id:1731968]. Through another epistasis analysis, you will determine the interplay between this repressive system and the core inductive component, Ras (LET-60).", "problem": "In the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*, the development of the vulva provides a powerful model system for studying intercellular signaling and cell fate specification. The vulva forms from a subset of six ectodermal cells known as the vulval precursor cells (VPCs), labeled P3.p through P8.p. In a wild-type hermaphrodite, a single cell in the gonad, the anchor cell (AC), secretes an inductive signal, a protein homologous to Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF). This signal is received by the nearest VPC, P6.p, through a receptor tyrosine kinase, leading to the activation of an intracellular Ras/MAPK signaling cascade. The protein LET-60, a homolog of the human Ras protein, is a critical component of this cascade. This activation causes P6.p to adopt the primary (1°) vulval fate. P6.p then sends a lateral signal to its neighbors, P5.p and P7.p, inducing them to adopt the secondary (2°) vulval fate. The remaining VPCs (P3.p, P4.p, and P8.p), which receive no signal, adopt a non-vulval tertiary (3°) fate and become part of the hypodermis. This precise pattern of fates, 3°-3°-2°-1°-2°-3°, results in a single, functional vulva, a phenotype referred to as Wild-type (WT).\n\nGenetic mutations can disrupt this process, leading to distinct phenotypes:\n- **Vulvaless (Vul)**: No vulva is formed because all VPCs adopt the 3° fate.\n- **Multivulva (Muv)**: Multiple vulva-like structures are formed because VPCs that normally adopt the 3° fate are induced to adopt 1° or 2° fates.\n\nVulval induction is also negatively regulated by a set of synthetic Multivulva (synMuv) genes. These genes fall into two redundant classes, synMuvA and synMuvB. The protein products of these two classes work together to repress the Ras signaling pathway. A loss-of-function mutation in a gene from only one class (e.g., a synMuvA mutant or a synMuvB mutant) results in a WT phenotype due to the redundancy. However, if a worm has loss-of-function mutations in both a synMuvA gene and a synMuvB gene, the repression is lost, the Ras pathway becomes hyperactive, and the worm exhibits a Muv phenotype. The gene *lin-15* is a well-characterized synMuvB gene.\n\nAs a developmental geneticist, you are performing an epistasis analysis to determine the functional relationship between the inductive and repressive pathways. You construct a double mutant worm that carries both a loss-of-function allele of the synMuvB gene, *lin-15(lf)*, and a loss-of-function allele of the Ras homolog, *let-60(lf)*. Both mutations are assumed to be null or strong loss-of-function, but do not cause lethality before vulval development is complete.\n\nBased on your understanding of these genetic pathways, predict the vulval phenotype of this *lin-15(lf) ; let-60(lf)* double mutant worm.\n\nA.

The *let-60(lf)* mutation inactivates the core Ras signaling protein. Without a functional LET-60/Ras, the inductive signal cannot be transduced to the nucleus, regardless of any other signals. Therefore, all VPCs adopt the default 3° fate, leading to a **Vulvaless (Vul)** phenotype.\n2. The *lin-15(lf)* mutation inactivates a synMuvB gene, which is a negative regulator of the Ras pathway. As the problem states, the synMuvA and synMuvB pathways are redundant. Losing only one, as in a *lin-15(lf)* single mutant, does not cause a phenotype; the worm is **Wild-type (WT)**.\n3. In the double mutant *lin-15(lf) ; let-60(lf)*, the pathway is broken at the level of LET-60/Ras. Since LET-60/Ras is essential for signaling, its loss of function is the determining factor. The pathway cannot be hyperactive (as in a Muv phenotype) if a core component is missing. Therefore, the Vul phenotype of *let-60(lf)* is epistatic to (masks) the WT phenotype of *lin-15(lf)*.
