{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A growth cone acts as the \"navigator\" and \"engine\" for a developing axon, actively exploring its environment to find its correct target. This remarkable motility isn't magic; it's driven by a highly dynamic internal scaffold, the actin cytoskeleton. This exercise challenges you to think like a cell biologist by predicting the consequences of disrupting this engine, forcing you to connect the molecular process of actin polymerization to the growth cone's structure and forward movement [@problem_id:1672395].", "problem": "In an *in vitro* experiment, a neuron from the dorsal root ganglion is cultured on a laminin-coated substrate, allowing it to extend an axon tipped with a motile growth cone. The growth cone is actively exploring its environment, characterized by dynamic, sheet-like extensions called lamellipodia and thin, finger-like protrusions called filopodia. A researcher introduces a novel synthetic drug, \"Inhibactin,\" to the culture medium. This drug is highly specific and functions solely by binding to actin monomers, preventing them from being added to the plus end of existing actin filaments. Assuming the drug quickly permeates the cell, which of the following statements most accurately describes the primary and most immediate consequence for the growth cone's structure and behavior?\n\nA. The growth cone will lose its ability to transport mitochondria and vesicles to the leading edge, but its overall shape and motility will remain unchanged.\n\nB. The growth cone will become rigid, freezing its lamellipodia and filopodia in their exact positions at the moment of drug application.\n\nC. The central core of the growth cone, which is rich in microtubules, will rapidly depolymerize, causing the axon shaft to retract.\n\nD. The lamellipodia and filopodia will collapse, and the growth cone will cease its forward exploratory movement.", "solution": "The lamellipodia and filopodia of a growth cone are actin-based protrusions that require continuous actin polymerization at the barbed (plus) ends to push the membrane forward. The fundamental kinetic description of actin dynamics at a filament end is\n$$\nv_{+} = a\\left(k_{on}^{+}[G] - k_{off}^{+}\\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad v_{-} = a\\left(k_{off}^{-} - k_{on}^{-}[G]\\right),\n$$\nwhere $v_{+}$ is the barbed-end elongation velocity, $v_{-}$ is the pointed-end shrinkage velocity (taken positive when the filament shortens from that end), $a$ is the monomer axial increment per subunit added, $k_{on}^{\\pm}$ and $k_{off}^{\\pm}$ are the on/off rate constants at the plus and minus ends, and $[G]$ is the concentration of free actin monomer. In steady protrusion, lamellipodial advance requires $v_{+}$ to exceed the retrograde flow velocity $v_{retro}$:\n$$\nv_{prot} = v_{+} - v_{retro} > 0.\n$$\nThe drug Inhibactin binds actin monomers and prevents their addition specifically at the plus end. Functionally, this sets the effective plus-end addition term to zero, so $k_{on}^{+}[G] \\to 0$ at the barbed end. Immediately after drug application,\n$$\nv_{+} \\to a\\left(0 - k_{off}^{+}\\right) = -a\\,k_{off}^{+}  0,\n$$\nso the barbed end shortens. The pointed end typically continues to depolymerize under physiological conditions, with\n$$\nv_{-} = a\\left(k_{off}^{-} - k_{on}^{-}[G]\\right) > 0,\n$$\nand the net filament length change is\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{dt} = v_{+} - v_{-}  0.\n$$\nThus, F-actin networks in lamellipodia and bundles in filopodia rapidly lose length and integrity. Because membrane protrusion requires $v_{prot} = v_{+} - v_{retro}$ and $v_{+}$ becomes negative, $v_{prot}$ becomes negative, leading to retraction rather than protrusion. Consequently, the lamellipodia and filopodia collapse and exploratory forward movement ceases.\n\nThis effect is immediate and primary because it follows directly from blocking plus-end actin addition, which is the rate-limiting step for protrusion. In contrast:\n- Option A is incorrect because anterograde transport of mitochondria and vesicles primarily depends on microtubules and motor proteins; actin inhibition does not primarily abolish their transport, and the growth cone shape would not remain unchanged.\n- Option B is incorrect because inhibiting polymerization does not rigidify or freeze structures; continuous turnover is required to maintain them, and without plus-end addition, they collapse due to ongoing depolymerization and retrograde flow.\n- Option C is incorrect because Inhibactin targets actin monomers; microtubules (in the central domain) are not the primary target and do not rapidly depolymerize as a direct and immediate effect.\n\nTherefore, the primary and most immediate consequence is collapse of lamellipodia and filopodia with cessation of forward exploratory movement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1672395"}, {"introduction": "Knowing how a growth cone moves is only half the story; we also need to understand the signals that direct its path. The environment is filled with molecular \"signposts\"—attractive and repulsive cues—that guide the axon. This problem places you in the role of a researcher using a foundational technique, the growth cone collapse assay, to interpret experimental data. Your task is to deduce whether a molecule acts as a repulsive cue and to unravel the first steps of its intracellular signaling pathway, a process central to modern neurobiology [@problem_id:1672337].", "problem": "A developmental neurobiologist is investigating the molecular mechanisms of axon guidance in the peripheral nervous system. The researcher cultures dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons on a substrate and allows them to extend axons. The goal is to identify novel repulsive guidance cues. To do this, they perform a series of growth cone collapse assays using three purified molecules of interest: Molecule A, Molecule B, and Molecule C. Molecule C is a known intracellular kinase. The experiment consists of four conditions, and the percentage of growth cones exhibiting a collapsed morphology (defined as a loss of lamellipodia and filopodia) is quantified after a 30-minute incubation.\n\nThe results are as follows:\n\n1.  **Control Condition:** Neurons are incubated in the standard culture medium. Result: 11% of growth cones are collapsed.\n2.  **Molecule A Condition:** The culture medium is supplemented with Molecule A. Result: 87% of growth cones are collapsed.\n3.  **Molecule B Condition:** The culture medium is supplemented with Molecule B. Result: 13% of growth cones are collapsed.\n4.  **Inhibitor Condition:** The culture medium is supplemented with both Molecule A and a specific pharmacological inhibitor of Molecule C's kinase activity. Result: 15% of growth cones are collapsed.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following statements provides the most accurate conclusion?\n\nA. Molecule C is the cell-surface receptor for the repulsive cue Molecule A.\n\nB. Molecule B is an attractive guidance cue for DRG neurons.\n\nC. Both Molecule A and Molecule B are repulsive guidance cues, but Molecule A is more potent.\n\nD. Molecule A is a repulsive guidance cue whose downstream signaling pathway requires the kinase activity of Molecule C.\n\nE. The high level of collapse in the presence of Molecule A is a toxic artifact, and Molecule A is not a true guidance cue.", "solution": "We interpret growth cone collapse assays based on the principle that repulsive guidance cues increase the fraction of growth cones exhibiting collapsed morphology, whereas attractive cues tend to stabilize or promote protrusive structures and thus reduce collapse relative to baseline. The baseline (control) collapse fraction provides the reference level for spontaneous collapse in culture.\n\nFirst, establish the baseline: in the control condition the collapse fraction is $0.11$. This represents the spontaneous collapse without added cues.\n\nSecond, evaluate Molecule A: with Molecule A, the collapse fraction increases to $0.87$, which is a large elevation relative to $0.11$. By the operational definition of the assay, this strong increase is consistent with Molecule A acting as a repulsive guidance cue.\n\nThird, evaluate Molecule B: with Molecule B, the collapse fraction is $0.13$, which is approximately equal to the control value $0.11$. This indicates that Molecule B does not produce a significant repulsive effect. It also does not show evidence of being attractive in this assay, because an attractive cue would be expected to reduce collapse below baseline rather than remain at baseline levels.\n\nFourth, test pathway dependence using the inhibitor of Molecule C’s kinase activity: when Molecule A is applied together with the specific inhibitor of Molecule C kinase activity, the collapse fraction is $0.15$, which is close to the control $0.11$ and dramatically reduced from $0.87$. The most direct interpretation is that the repulsive effect of Molecule A requires the kinase activity of Molecule C; inhibiting Molecule C prevents A-induced collapse. This pattern indicates pathway specificity rather than nonspecific toxicity: were Molecule A merely toxic, a specific kinase inhibitor of Molecule C would not be expected to rescue the phenotype to near-baseline levels.\n\nFifth, assess each statement:\n- Statement A is not supported: Molecule C is stated to be an intracellular kinase, not a cell-surface receptor; the data indicate a requirement for its kinase activity downstream, not that it is the receptor for Molecule A.\n- Statement B is not supported: Molecule B does not reduce collapse below baseline; it appears inert in this assay rather than attractive.\n- Statement C is false: Molecule B does not increase collapse above baseline, so it is not repulsive.\n- Statement D matches the observed rescue: Molecule A is repulsive, and its effect depends on Molecule C’s kinase activity.\n- Statement E is inconsistent with the inhibitor rescue: specific blockade of Molecule C reversing the effect argues against a nonspecific toxic artifact.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that Molecule A is a repulsive guidance cue whose downstream signaling requires the kinase activity of Molecule C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1672337"}, {"introduction": "One of the most astonishing feats of a growth cone is its ability to detect incredibly shallow chemical gradients—sometimes a difference of only a few molecules from one side to the other. This raises a fundamental question: how does a cell turn such a faint external whisper into a decisive internal shout? This quantitative practice guides you through a biophysical model to explore the concept of signal amplification, showing how receptor binding and ultrasensitive intracellular cascades work together to transform a weak external signal into a robust directional command for growth [@problem_id:1672339].", "problem": "A neuronal growth cone navigates through tissue by detecting gradients of chemoattractants. Consider a growth cone in a shallow gradient of a chemoattractant. The average concentration of the chemoattractant at the growth cone's location is $C_0$, but there is a 1.00% relative difference in concentration across its diameter. This means the relative difference, defined as the difference in concentration between the high and low sides divided by the average concentration, is 0.0100.\n\nThe growth cone's response to this gradient involves two main stages: receptor binding and intracellular signal amplification.\n\n1.  **Receptor Binding**: The binding of the chemoattractant to its receptors is governed by the Langmuir isotherm. The fraction of receptors that are bound, $\\theta$, is a function of the local chemoattractant concentration $C$, given by:\n    $$ \\theta(C) = \\frac{C}{C + K_D} $$\n    where $K_D$ is the dissociation constant. The average concentration at the growth cone is known to be one-tenth of the dissociation constant, i.e., $C_0 = 0.100 K_D$.\n\n2.  **Signal Amplification**: The fraction of bound receptors, $\\theta$, triggers an intracellular signaling cascade. This cascade exhibits ultrasensitivity, meaning a small change in the input ($\\theta$) can produce a much larger change in the output. The steady-state concentration of the final signaling molecule, $[M]$, which is responsible for directing cytoskeletal rearrangement and growth, is related to $\\theta$ by a Hill equation:\n    $$ [M] = M_{\\text{max}} \\frac{\\theta^n}{\\theta^n + K_{\\text{act}}^n} $$\n    where $M_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum possible concentration of the signaling molecule, $n$ is the Hill coefficient representing the degree of cooperativity, and $K_{\\text{act}}$ is the activation constant, which is the fraction of bound receptors ($\\theta$) required to achieve half-maximal response. The cascade has a Hill coefficient of $n=4.00$, and its activation constant is $K_{\\text{act}} = 0.100$.\n\nAssuming the external concentration gradient is small, calculate the resulting percentage relative difference in the concentration of the final signaling molecule, $[M]$, across the growth cone.
