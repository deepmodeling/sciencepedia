A fundamental test for any candidate morphogen is to ask whether it is *sufficient* to specify cell fates. This classic thought experiment models a landmark study in developmental biology, challenging you to predict the outcome when a source of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is placed in a novel location within the limb bud, directly testing its power to organize the anterior-posterior axis. [@problem_id:1715085]", "problem": "In vertebrate limb development, the identity of digits along the anterior-posterior axis (analogous to the thumb-to-pinky axis in humans) is specified by a secreted signaling molecule. A small region of tissue at the posterior margin of the developing limb bud, known as the Zone of Polarizing Activity (ZPA), is the source of this signal. The current model posits that this signal functions as a morphogen, where different concentrations specify distinct digit identities. In the developing chick wing, the normal digit pattern, ordered from anterior to posterior, is 2-3-4. This pattern is thought to arise from a concentration gradient of the morphogen: a high concentration specifies digit 4 (posterior-most), an intermediate concentration specifies digit 3, and a low or absent concentration specifies digit 2 (anterior-most).\n\nAn experiment is designed to test the hypothesis that the protein Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a sufficient signal for this patterning process. A small, inert bead is soaked in a high concentration of purified, recombinant Shh protein. This bead is then surgically implanted into the anterior margin of an early chick wing bud, a region that normally gives rise to digit 2 and is distant from the endogenous ZPA. The embryo is then incubated, allowing the limb to develop.\n\nAssuming that Shh is indeed the morphogen responsible for posterior digit identity and that the implanted bead successfully establishes a stable, ectopic source of Shh, what is the predicted pattern of digits in the resulting wing, when viewed from anterior to posterior?\n\nA. 2-3-4\n\nB. 4-4-4\n\nC. 2-2-2\n\nD. 4-3-2-3-4\n\nE. 4-3-2", "solution": "Assume the anterior-posterior axis is parameterized by a coordinate $x \\in [0,L]$, with $x=0$ at the anterior margin and $x=L$ at the posterior margin. Let $c(x)$ denote the local concentration of the morphogen.

A standard steady-state diffusion-decay model for a localized source yields a monotonic decreasing function of the distance from the source; for concreteness, one may write\n$$\nc_{P}(x) = A_{P} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{L - x}{\\lambda}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $A_{P} > 0$ characterizes source strength and $\\lambda > 0$ is an effective length scale.

By predicting the limb phenotype, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how the entire chain of command, from ligand to nucleus, is necessary for proper development.

The Shh signal is interpreted by target cells through a specific signaling pathway. In the absence of Shh, the transmembrane receptor Patched1 (Ptc1) actively inhibits another transmembrane protein, Smoothened (Smo). This inhibition leads to the proteolytic processing of the Gli transcription factor into a repressor form (GliR), which blocks the expression of genes required for posterior limb structures. When Shh binds to Ptc1, the inhibition on Smo is relieved. Active Smo then prevents the processing of Gli into its repressor form, allowing the full-length activator form (GliA) to promote the expression of posterior-identity genes. High concentrations of Shh specify the most posterior digits (e.g., digit 5, the pinky), while lower concentrations specify more intermediate digits (e.g., digit 3, the middle finger).\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario in which a genetic mutation occurs in the gene encoding the Ptc1 receptor.

The relevant logic is:\n- In the absence of Shh: Ptc1 inhibits Smo, leading to processing of Gli into a repressor form (GliR). GliR blocks posterior-identity gene expression, favoring anterior identities.\n- In the presence of Shh: Shh binds Ptc1 and relieves its inhibition on Smo. Active Smo prevents Gli processing into GliR, allowing full-length Gli activator (GliA) to promote posterior-identity gene expression. High Shh specifies more posterior digits.\n\nStep 2: In the hypothetical mutation, Ptc1 constitutively inhibits Smo regardless of Shh binding. Therefore:\n- Smo remains inactive throughout the limb bud even in the presence of Shh.\n- Gli is constitutively processed into GliR, preventing the formation of GliA.\n- Posterior-identity genes fail to be expressed because the pathway remains off, independent of Shh concentrations.\n\nStep 3: Predicted patterning consequence:\n- With posterior signaling blocked, posterior fates cannot be specified. The limb becomes anteriorized, losing posterior digits. This yields a hand lacking posterior digits (such as digits $4$ and $5$), potentially leaving only one or two anterior-like digits.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options:\n- A (extra posterior-like digits) requires ectopic/constitutive Shh pathway activation (e.g., loss of Ptc1 function or constitutively active Smo), the opposite of constitutive inhibition; thus incorrect.\n- B (loss of proximal bones) refers to proximodistal patterning controlled primarily by AER/FGF signaling, not directly by Shh; thus incorrect.\n- C (loss of posterior digits, anteriorization) matches the predicted outcome of constitutive Smo inhibition; thus correct.\n- D (mirror-image duplication) typically results from ectopic anterior Shh/ZPA activity, i.e., increased posteriorizing signal, not its suppression; thus incorrect.\n- E (normal development due to high Shh overcoming inhibition) contradicts the mutation’s definition; if Ptc1 inhibition is constitutive and Shh-insensitive, Shh cannot rescue; thus incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is the loss of posterior digits with anteriorization of the limb pattern, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1715098"}, {"introduction": "Morphogen action is inherently dose-dependent, meaning that *how much* signal a cell receives is as important as whether it receives the signal at all.

This molecule, a morphogen, is produced by a small block of tissue at the posterior margin of the developing limb bud called the Zone of Polarizing Activity (ZPA). The morphogen produced by the ZPA is Sonic hedgehog (Shh). It diffuses from the ZPA to form a concentration gradient across the limb bud.

Let the Shh concentration along the anterior-posterior axis be denoted by a monotonically decreasing function $c(x)$, with $x$ increasing from posterior to anterior. Digit identities are assigned by threshold responses to Shh (dose and duration), which can be idealized as concentration thresholds $T_{5} > T_{4} > T_{3} > T_{2} > T_{1}$, where $T_{1}$ represents effectively no Shh and $T_{5}$ represents the highest requirement for posterior identity. In the normal case, there exist positions $x_{i}$ such that\n$$\nc(x_{5}) \\geq T_{5},\\quad c(x_{4}) \\in [T_{4}, T_{5}),\\quad c(x_{3}) \\in [T_{3}, T_{4}),\\quad c(x_{2}) \\in [T_{2}, T_{3}),\\quad c(x_{1}) < T_{2}\\ \\text{(effectively no Shh for digit 1)}.\n$$\nGrafting a second ZPA immediately adjacent to the endogenous ZPA at the posterior margin does not create a new anterior source; rather, it effectively increases the width and output of the posterior source. This modifies the gradient to a new profile $c'(x)$ that remains monotonically decreasing from posterior to anterior but has higher concentrations at each anterior position:\n$$\nc'(x) > c(x)\\ \\text{for all}\\ x\\ \\text{within the limb field},\\quad \\text{with}\\ \\frac{d c'}{d x} < 0.\n$$\nBecause thresholds determine fate, increasing $c$ to $c'$ shifts all isoconcentration positions $x_{i}$ anteriorly. Specifically, the region with $c'(x) \\geq T_{5}$ expands, the regions for $T_{4}$ and $T_{3}$ shift anteriorly, and the most anterior territory that previously had $c(x) \\approx 0$ (producing digit 1) may now experience $c'(x) \\geq T_{2}$, eliminating the no-Shh domain and thereby losing digit 1. Since no anterior ZPA is created, the gradient does not become biphasic and there is no mirror-image duplication. Thus, the outcome is posteriorization of identities: loss of the most anterior digit and duplication/expansion of posterior identities. Among the options, the pattern consistent with a single, expanded posterior source, monotonic gradient, loss of digit 1, and expansion of high-Shh fates is a limb with digits 2-3-4-5-5.\n\nOption B (mirror-imaged 5-4-3-4-5) requires an ectopic anterior ZPA, which is not the case here. Option C assumes no effect, which contradicts the increased Shh exposure. Option D requires a second source at the anterior margin to generate an additional series, which is not present. Option E (single large digit 5) is inconsistent with the continuous field and graded thresholds which typically yield multiple digits with shifted identities rather than a solitary element.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is option A: 2-3-4-5-5.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1715110"}]}
