The homeodomain achieves its DNA-binding capability through a stable three-helix bundle, which is itself stabilized by a core of hydrophobic amino acids. This practice explores the critical importance of this structural integrity through a hypothetical mutation, challenging you to predict the functional consequences of disrupting this core and demonstrating why even a single, strategically placed amino acid change can be catastrophic for the protein's function. [@problem_id:1723429]", "problem": "The homeodomain is a highly conserved protein motif of approximately 60 amino acids, found in a large family of transcription factors that play a crucial role in orchestrating embryonic development. The structure of the homeodomain consists of a three-helix bundle, which is stabilized by a hydrophobic core formed by the packing of nonpolar amino acid side chains in the protein's interior. This precise three-dimensional structure is essential for the domain to recognize and bind to specific regulatory sequences in the major groove of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).\n\nConsider a specific homeodomain protein where a highly conserved tryptophan (Trp) residue is located deep within its hydrophobic core. Tryptophan is an amino acid with a large, nonpolar, aromatic side chain. Through site-directed mutagenesis, this tryptophan residue is replaced with a glutamine (Gln) residue, which has a polar, uncharged side chain.\n\nBased on fundamental principles of protein structure and function, what is the most likely consequence of this single Trp-to-Gln mutation?\n\nA. The mutation will have a negligible effect on both the protein's tertiary structure and its DNA-binding affinity, as it is only a single amino acid change.\n\nB. The mutation will significantly enhance the DNA-binding affinity because the polar glutamine can form new, favorable hydrogen bonds with the phosphate backbone of the DNA.\n\nC. The mutation will severely disrupt the protein's tertiary structure, leading to misfolding and a subsequent loss of its ability to bind DNA.\n\nD. The mutation will alter the primary structure but will not affect the tertiary structure or the protein's function, as these are determined by the entire amino acid sequence, not a single residue.\n\nE. The mutation will not change the overall tertiary structure of the three-helix bundle, but it will abolish DNA binding because tryptophan is the specific residue that directly forms contacts with the DNA bases.", "solution": "We analyze the effect of substituting a deeply buried tryptophan in the hydrophobic core of a homeodomain with glutamine, based on established principles of protein structure and energetics.\n\nFirst, the hydrophobic effect is a dominant driving force for protein folding: nonpolar side chains are preferentially buried in the protein interior to minimize the exposure of hydrophobic surface area to water, thereby stabilizing the folded state. A conserved tryptophan in the core typically contributes significantly to stability through its large, nonpolar, aromatic side chain, which packs tightly into the hydrophobic core, fills internal volume, and engages in favorable van der Waals and aromatic stacking interactions. Conservation across a protein family indicates strong functional or structural constraint, implying that this residue is critical for maintaining the fold.\n\nSecond, replacing tryptophan with glutamine introduces a polar, uncharged side chain into the hydrophobic core. Buried polar groups incur a large desolvation penalty unless they can form internally satisfied hydrogen bonds. In a tightly packed hydrophobic core, the likelihood that a newly introduced polar amide can make sufficient, properly oriented hydrogen bonds to offset the desolvation and packing penalties is low. Additionally, the substitution reduces side-chain volume and hydrophobic surface area, creating cavities or packing defects that further destabilize the core. The net effect is a large destabilization of the folded state, often manifesting as misfolding, reduced stability, or partial unfolding.\n\nThird, the DNA-binding function of the homeodomain depends on the integrity of its three-helix bundle, particularly the correct positioning of the recognition helix that docks into the major groove. Loss of the native fold or significant destabilization of the tertiary structure prevents proper DNA binding. The conserved core tryptophan is not typically the residue that directly contacts DNA bases; rather, it maintains the structural framework needed for specific recognition. Therefore, a prediction that DNA binding is abolished while the overall fold remains intact is inconsistent with the role of a deeply buried core residue.\n\nFinally, the idea that a single substitution in a conserved core position would have negligible effects is contradicted by protein folding thermodynamics and extensive mutational analyses: single core mutations frequently cause large destabilizations and functional loss. Similarly, a proposed enhancement of DNA binding due to new hydrogen bonds is implausible because the mutated residue is buried and not positioned to interact with DNA; moreover, the introduced polarity in the core is deleterious.\n\nTherefore, the most likely consequence is severe disruption of the protein’s tertiary structure due to destabilization of the hydrophobic core, resulting in misfolding and loss of DNA-binding ability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1723429"}, {"introduction": "Homeodomain proteins do not act in isolation; they are key players in complex gene regulatory networks, interpreting positional information and activating downstream targets.
