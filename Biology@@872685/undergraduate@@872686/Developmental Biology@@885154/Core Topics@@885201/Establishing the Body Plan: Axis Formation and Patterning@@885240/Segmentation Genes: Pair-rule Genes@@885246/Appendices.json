The gap genes are among the first to be expressed, and they regulate the expression of the pair-rule genes, which are expressed in a pattern of seven stripes.\n\nConsider the regulation of the second stripe of the pair-rule gene *even-skipped* (*eve*). A specific enhancer element drives the expression of *eve* stripe 2. The activity of this enhancer is controlled by transcription factors encoded by maternal effect and gap genes. For this problem, we will use a simplified model of this regulation along the anteroposterior axis, measured in percent egg length (% EL), where 0% is the anterior pole and 100% is the posterior pole.\n\nThe rules for the expression of *eve* stripe 2 are as follows:\n1.  A set of ubiquitous maternal and gap gene products acts as activators. Their combined effect is to create an activating potential in the anterior half of the embryo, specifically in the region from 0% to 60% EL.\n2.  The gap gene *giant* (*gt*) encodes a repressor protein. It is expressed in two domains: an anterior domain from 0% to 30% EL and a posterior domain from 70% to 85% EL.\n3.  The gap gene *Krüppel* (*Kr*) encodes another repressor protein. In a wild-type embryo, it is expressed in a central domain from 40% to 60% EL.\n4.  The *eve* stripe 2 enhancer is active, and thus the stripe is expressed, **only** in regions where the activating potential is present **and** both the Giant and Krüppel repressors are absent.\n\nBased on this model, predict the expression pattern of *eve* stripe 2 in a homozygous mutant embryo that completely lacks a functional *Krüppel* gene product (*Kr*-null mutant).\n\nA.

Denote this set by $A=[0,0.6]$.\n- Giant is present for $x \\in [0,0.3] \\cup [0.7,0.85]$. Denote this set by $G=[0,0.3] \\cup [0.7,0.85]$.\n- In the wild type, Kr is present for $x \\in [0.4,0.6]$, but in the Kr-null mutant, Kr is absent everywhere. Denote the Kr domain in the mutant by $K=\\varnothing$.\n\nThe regulatory rule states: the enhancer is active only where activation is present and both repressors are absent. In set notation, the expression domain $E$ is\n$$\nE \\;=\\; A \\cap G^{c} \\cap K^{c} \\;=\\; A \\setminus (G \\cup K).\n$$\nIn the Kr-null mutant, $K=\\varnothing$, hence $G \\cup K = G$, so\n$$\nE \\;=\\; A \\setminus G \\;=\\; [0,0.6] \\setminus \\big([0,0.3] \\cup [0.7,0.85]\\big).\n$$\nSince $[0.7,0.85] \\cap [0,0.6]=\\varnothing$, this simplifies to\n$$\nE \\;=\\; [0,0.6] \\setminus [0,0.3] \\;=\\; [0.3,0.6].\n$$\n\nInterpretation: with Kr absent, the anterior boundary is set by the anterior Giant boundary at $x=0.3$, and the posterior boundary is set by the limit of the activating region at $x=0.6$.

This problem delves into the relationship between primary and secondary pair-rule genes, focusing on how the expression of one gene directly controls another. This thought experiment, involving the ubiquitous expression of a repressor, is a classic method in genetics to uncover regulatory connections and is key to understanding how the intricate, alternating pattern of pair-rule gene expression is achieved [@problem_id:1714008].", "problem": "In the early embryonic development of the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, a hierarchical cascade of gene expression establishes the segmented body plan. After maternal-effect and gap genes define broad regions along the anterior-posterior axis, pair-rule genes are expressed in a pattern of seven transverse stripes. These genes are crucial for the formation of parasegments.\n\nPair-rule genes can be classified as primary or secondary. The expression of primary pair-rule genes, such as *hairy* (*h*), is controlled by the gap genes. The expression of secondary pair-rule genes, such as *fushi tarazu* (*ftz*), is regulated by the primary pair-rule genes.\n\nIn a wild-type embryo, the protein product of the *hairy* gene acts as a transcriptional repressor for the *ftz* gene. This repression is a key part of the mechanism that creates the alternating stripe patterns of these two genes.\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment where a genetically modified *Drosophila* embryo is created. In this embryo, due to an engineered construct, the *hairy* gene is expressed at a high level ubiquitously (uniformly) across the entire blastoderm, starting at the time when pair-rule genes would normally be activated.

In the wild type, the protein product of the hairy gene functions as a transcriptional repressor of ftz by binding to its regulatory elements, creating a pattern where ftz stripes appear in domains where hairy is absent or low, and ftz is repressed where hairy is present.\n\nGiven the hypothetical condition that hairy is expressed at a high level ubiquitously across the blastoderm at the onset of pair-rule gene activation, the repressor (Hairy protein) would be present everywhere that ftz could otherwise be expressed. Since repression by hairy is a direct regulatory input controlling ftz expression, ubiquitous high-level hairy would block transcription of ftz throughout the embryo. Other normal activators or regulatory inputs for ftz cannot override a uniformly applied strong repression. Therefore, there would be no spatial domain permissive for ftz expression.\n\nThis rules out:\n- Uniform ftz expression (A), because repression is global.\n- The normal seven stripes (B), because the alternating pattern requires regions lacking hairy, which are absent here.\n- Fourteen stripes (C), because this would require additional alternating regulatory logic, not compatible with uniform repression.\n- Expression where hairy is normally expressed (E), because even in wild type, hairy domains correlate with ftz repression, and here hairy is everywhere.\n\nTherefore, ftz expression would be completely absent throughout the embryo.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1714008"}, {"introduction": "Our understanding of development often comes from static images of dynamic processes, making it crucial to consider the temporal dimension of gene expression. This problem challenges you to think about the fundamental time delay that exists between transcription (creating mRNA) and translation (making protein).

The pair-rule genes, a key component of this cascade, are expressed in seven transverse stripes in the syncytial blastoderm, a stage where nuclei share a common cytoplasm.\n\nConsider the pair-rule gene *fushi tarazu* (*ftz*). The expression of *ftz* is highly dynamic. After their initial appearance, the stripes of *ftz* expression progressively sharpen and narrow over a period of several minutes. This narrowing occurs as the boundaries of each stripe move towards the stripe's center.\n\nAn experiment is conducted on an embryo at a developmental time when the *ftz* stripes are actively narrowing. The embryo is fixed, and a dual-staining technique is applied to simultaneously visualize the spatial distribution of *ftz* messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) and the Ftz protein that is translated from it. It is a fundamental principle of molecular biology that a time delay exists between the transcription of a gene into mRNA and the subsequent translation of that mRNA into a functional protein.\n\nGiven this time delay and the dynamic narrowing of the expression stripes, how would the observed Ftz protein stripe be positioned relative to its corresponding *ftz* mRNA stripe at the moment of fixation?\n\nA. The protein stripe is perfectly co-localized and has the same width as the mRNA stripe.\n\nB. The protein stripe is narrower than the mRNA stripe and is centered within the boundaries of the mRNA stripe.\n\nC. The protein stripe is slightly wider than the mRNA stripe, with its edges extending just beyond the edges of the mRNA stripe.\n\nD.

Thus the effective protein edges at time $t$ reflect earlier positions:\n$$\nx_{\\text{protein}}^{-}(t)\\approx x^{-}(t-\\Delta t),\\quad x_{\\text{protein}}^{+}(t)\\approx x^{+}(t-\\Delta t).\n$$\nSince $w(t)$ is decreasing in time,\n$$\nw(t-\\Delta t)>w(t)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x^{-}(t-\\Delta t)<x^{-}(t)\\ \\ \\text{and}\\ \\ x^{+}(t-\\Delta t)>x^{+}(t).\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nx_{\\text{protein}}^{-}(t)<x^{-}(t)\\quad\\text{and}\\quad x_{\\text{protein}}^{+}(t)>x^{+}(t),\n$$\nso the protein stripe at fixation is wider than the contemporaneous mRNA stripe.
