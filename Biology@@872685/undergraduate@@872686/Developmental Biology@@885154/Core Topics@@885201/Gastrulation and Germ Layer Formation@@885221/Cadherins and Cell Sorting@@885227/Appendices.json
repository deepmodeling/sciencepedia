Each cell line expresses a single, unique type of homophilic adhesion molecule on its surface, leading to different adhesive properties. To determine the relative adhesion strengths, the biologist performs two experiments.\n\nIn the first experiment, equal numbers of Alpha cells and Beta cells are dissociated and then allowed to reaggregate in a liquid culture. Over time, the cells sort out, forming a single spherical mass where the Alpha cells form a compact internal core, completely enveloped by the Beta cells.\n\nIn the second experiment, equal numbers of Beta cells and Gamma cells are similarly mixed. They also sort out, forming a single spherical mass where the Beta cells form a compact internal core, completely enveloped by the Gamma cells.\n\nNow, the biologist conducts a third experiment, mixing equal numbers of all three cell types—Alpha, Beta, and Gamma—in one culture and allowing them to reaggregate until they reach a stable, minimum-energy configuration.\n\nBased on the outcomes of the first two experiments and the principles of differential cell adhesion, which of the following describes the most likely final arrangement of the three cell types?\n\nA.

Both populations are genetically engineered.\n\nPopulation A is engineered to express only a standard, classical cadherin known as E-cadherin. This protein has an extracellular domain for homophilic binding, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain that links to the actin cytoskeleton via catenin proteins.\n\nPopulation B is engineered to express only a non-classical cadherin known as T-cadherin.

Denote by $\\gamma_{ij}$ the effective interfacial tension between phases $i$ and $j$ and by $A_{ij}$ the corresponding interfacial area. For two cell populations A and B in a medium M, the free energy is\n$$\nF=\\gamma_{AM}A_{AM}+\\gamma_{BM}A_{BM}+\\gamma_{AB}A_{AB}.\n$$\nAt equilibrium, $F$ is minimized subject to fixed volumes $V_{A}$ and $V_{B}$.\n\nKey mechanistic link: For cell interfaces, the effective interfacial tension reflects a balance between cortical contractility and adhesion and can be represented schematically as\n$$\n\\gamma_{ij}=T_{i}+T_{j}-2W_{ij},\n$$\nwhere $T_{i}$ is the cortical tension of cell type $i$ and $W_{ij}$ is the adhesion energy density between $i$ and $j$. At the tissue–medium interface, adhesion to the medium is negligible so $\\gamma_{iM}\\approx T_{i}$.\n\nRanking of cohesivity and surface tensions: Population A (E-cadherin) forms adherens junctions that are mechanically coupled to the actin cortex via catenins, which yields large $W_{AA}$ and robust, load-bearing cell–cell adhesion. This produces a highly cohesive tissue that exhibits a larger apparent tissue–medium surface tension, so\n$$\n\\gamma_{AM}>\\gamma_{BM}.\n$$\nPopulation B (T-cadherin), being GPI-anchored and lacking a cytoplasmic domain, cannot couple adhesion to the cytoskeleton; despite comparable extracellular homophilic affinity, its junctions are weak under cortical tension, giving smaller effective adhesion and lower cohesivity, hence a smaller $\\gamma_{BM}$.\n\nConsequence for sorting: Minimization of $F$ favors eliminating external area weighted by the larger coefficient. Thus, to reduce $\\gamma_{AM}A_{AM}+\\gamma_{BM}A_{BM}$ at fixed total volume and outer surface area, the phase with lower $\\gamma_{iM}$ should occupy the exterior, and the phase with higher $\\gamma_{iM}$ should be shielded from the medium by moving to the interior. Therefore, A internalizes and B envelops. Additionally, because heterotypic E- versus T-cadherin adhesion is weak compared to homotypic adhesion, $A_{AB}$ is minimized, ruling out random mixing or a checkerboard pattern.\n\nThus, the free-energy-minimizing configuration is a core–shell aggregate with the more cohesive, higher surface tension E-cadherin population (A) forming the core and the less cohesive T-cadherin population (B) forming the outer layer, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1673928"}, {"introduction": "This final exercise elevates our understanding from a qualitative to a quantitative framework by applying the Differential Interfacial Tension Hypothesis (DITH).

The sorting behavior of these cells is governed by the Differential Interfacial Tension Hypothesis (DITH), which posits that cell aggregates behave like immiscible fluids, rearranging to minimize their total interfacial free energy. The effective surface tension of a uniform cell aggregate, denoted by $\\Lambda$, is determined by a balance between the cell's active cortical tension, $\\sigma$, generated by the actomyosin cortex, and the cell-cell adhesion energy mediated by cadherins.\n\nA simplified model for the aggregate surface tension is given by the equation:\n$$ \\Lambda = \\sigma - \\alpha E^{2} $$\nwhere $E$ is the surface concentration of E-cadherin, and $\\alpha$ is a positive constant that quantifies how effectively cadherin-mediated adhesion reduces the overall tension.\n\nThe two engineered cell lines have the following properties:\n- **Cell Type 1**: These cells have been treated with a drug that completely incapacitates their actin motor-cortex, reducing their active cortical tension to a near-zero residual value of $\\sigma_1 = 0.5$ mN/m.

The central principle of DITH is that in a mixture of two cell populations, the population that forms an aggregate with the higher overall surface tension will behave like a liquid with higher surface tension. To minimize the total energy of the system, this population will minimize its surface area by forming a sphere and sorting to the interior of the aggregate, while the population with the lower aggregate surface tension will spread to surround it.\n\nThe aggregate surface tension, $\\Lambda$, for each cell type is given by the formula:\n$$ \\Lambda = \\sigma - \\alpha E^{2} $$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the cortical tension, $E$ is the E-cadherin concentration, and $\\alpha$ is a constant.\n\nWe need to calculate the aggregate surface tension for both Cell Type 1 ($\\Lambda_1$) and Cell Type 2 ($\\Lambda_2$).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the aggregate surface tension for Cell Type 1 ($\\Lambda_1$).**\nThe parameters for Cell Type 1 are:\n- Cortical tension, $\\sigma_1 = 0.5$ mN/m\n- E-cadherin concentration, $E_1 = 10.0$ a.u.\n- Adhesion constant, $\\alpha = 0.10$ mN/(m $\\cdot$ a.u.$^2$)\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$ \\Lambda_1 = \\sigma_1 - \\alpha E_1^{2} $$\n$$ \\Lambda_1 = 0.5 \\, \\text{mN/m} - \\left(0.10 \\, \\frac{\\text{mN}}{\\text{m} \\cdot \\text{a.u.}^2}\\right) \\times (10.0 \\, \\text{a.u.})^{2} $$\n$$ \\Lambda_1 = 0.5 - 0.10 \\times 100 $$\n$$ \\Lambda_1 = 0.5 - 10.0 $$\n$$ \\Lambda_1 = -9.5 \\, \\text{mN/m} $$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the aggregate surface tension for Cell Type 2 ($\\Lambda_2$).**\nThe parameters for Cell Type 2 are:\n- Cortical tension, $\\sigma_2 = 9.0$ mN/m\n- E-cadherin concentration, $E_2 = 5.0$ a.u.\n- Adhesion constant, $\\alpha = 0.10$ mN/(m $\\cdot$ a.u.$^2$)\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$ \\Lambda_2 = \\sigma_2 - \\alpha E_2^{2} $$\n$$ \\Lambda_2 = 9.0 \\, \\text{mN/m} - \\left(0.10 \\, \\frac{\\text{mN}}{\\text{m} \\cdot \\text{a.u.}^2}\\right) \\times (5.0 \\, \\text{a.u.})^{2} $$\n$$ \\Lambda_2 = 9.0 - 0.10 \\times 25 $$\n$$ \\Lambda_2 = 9.0 - 2.5 $$\n$$ \\Lambda_2 = 6.5 \\, \\text{mN/m} $$\n\n**Step 3: Compare the aggregate surface tensions and predict the sorting outcome.**\nWe have calculated the two aggregate surface tensions:\n- $\\Lambda_1 = -9.5$ mN/m\n- $\\Lambda_2 = 6.5$ mN/m\n\nComparing these values, we see that $\\Lambda_2 > \\Lambda_1$.\n\nAccording to the sorting rule of DITH, the cell population with the higher aggregate surface tension will sort internally to minimize its free energy. In this case, Cell Type 2 has the higher surface tension ($\\Lambda_2 = 6.5$ mN/m). Therefore, the Type 2 cells will form a cohesive spherical core. The Cell Type 1 population, having the lower surface tension ($\\Lambda_1 = -9.5$ mN/m), will envelop or engulf the core of Type 2 cells.\n\nThis outcome corresponds to the description in option B. The high cortical tension of Type 2 cells dominates over their moderate adhesion, resulting in a high positive surface tension.
