To visualize the lineage of cells that form the larval skeleton, the biologist creates a transgenic sea urchin line. This is achieved by microinjecting a DNA construct into fertilized eggs. The construct consists of the regulatory promoter region of the *SM30* gene linked to the coding sequence for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). The *SM30* gene encodes a spicule matrix protein, which is a key component of the calcium carbonate skeleton formed by the primary mesenchyme cells. Assuming the transgene integrates successfully and is expressed correctly, in which of the following cell types would GFP fluorescence first be detected during early development?\n\nA. Cells of the animal hemisphere in the 64-cell blastula\n\nB. The four small micromeres at the vegetal pole of the 32-cell stage embryo\n\nC. The non-skeletogenic mesenchyme cells of the late gastrula\n\nD. The four large micromeres at the vegetal pole of the 32-cell stage embryo\n\nE. The endodermal cells lining the archenteron", "solution": "The construct places GFP under the control of the regulatory promoter of the *SM30* gene, a spicule matrix protein. Therefore, GFP will be transcribed wherever and whenever the endogenous *SM30* promoter is active, meaning GFP fluorescence will mark cells executing the skeletogenic program.\n\nIn sea urchin embryogenesis, the skeletogenic lineage derives from the large micromeres. At the 32-cell stage, the original micromere quartet divides unequally into four large micromeres and four small micromeres. The large micromeres are specified as the skeletogenic precursors and initiate a gene regulatory network that later drives expression of spicule matrix genes like *SM30* in primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs). The small micromeres, by contrast, contribute to the germ line and coelomic pouch lineages and do not express skeletogenic genes.\n\nAlthough the *SM30* promoter becomes active later in development (at the mesenchyme blastula stage), the large micromeres at the 32-cell stage are the first cells committed to this fate. Among the options provided, which list early embryonic cell types, this choice correctly identifies the specified skeletogenic progenitor lineage. The other options are excluded because they represent incorrect cell types or lineages:\n*   Animal hemisphere cells are ectodermal and not skeletogenic.\n*   The four small micromeres are not skeletogenic.\n*   Non-skeletogenic mesenchyme cells do not express spicule matrix genes.\n*   The endodermal cells lining the archenteron are not part of the skeletogenic lineage.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the four large micromeres at the vegetal pole of the 32-cell stage embryo.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1716001"}, {"introduction": "Once specified, primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) must embark on a remarkable journey, migrating through the blastocoel to reach their target locations. How do they navigate? Biologists test hypotheses about guidance cues using carefully designed experiments. This next practice [@problem_id:1716005] challenges you to think like an experimentalist and determine the best approach to test if a specific molecule, fibronectin, is *necessary* for PMC migration, a critical distinction from it simply being present along the migratory path.", "problem": "In the early development of a sea urchin, a group of cells known as Primary Mesenchyme Cells (PMCs) detach from the vegetal pole and ingress into the fluid-filled cavity called the blastocoel. These PMCs then migrate along the inner wall of the blastocoel to specific locations where they will fuse to form the larval skeleton. It is hypothesized that this migration is not random but is guided by specific molecular cues. One leading hypothesis is that fibronectin, a protein of the extracellular matrix lining the blastocoel, serves as a required substrate or \"roadway\" for PMC migration.\n\nA developmental biologist wants to design an experiment to test the hypothesis that fibronectin is *necessary* for the proper migration of PMCs. Assume you have access to normal sea urchin embryos, antibodies that specifically bind to and block the function of sea urchin fibronectin, and a separate set of antibodies that specifically stain and visualize PMCs for microscopy.\n\nWhich of the following experimental designs and corresponding expected outcomes would provide the strongest evidence to support this hypothesis?\n\nA. Inject anti-fibronectin antibodies into the blastocoel of a normal embryo shortly after PMC ingression. The expected result is that PMCs fail to migrate away from the vegetal pole and instead form a clump.\n\nB. Stain a normal, unperturbed embryo with fluorescent antibodies for both fibronectin and PMCs. The expected result is that the migratory paths of PMCs show a high degree of overlap with the fibronectin network.\n\nC. Inject an excess of purified fibronectin into the blastocoel of a normal embryo. The expected result is that PMCs migrate faster or to incorrect locations due to the overabundance of the substrate.\n\nD. Use an embryo from a mutant sea urchin that fails to produce PMCs. Stain this embryo with anti-fibronectin antibodies. The expected result is that the fibronectin network is still present, showing it is formed independently of PMCs.\n\nE. Inject a chemical that prevents PMCs from ingressing into the blastocoel and simultaneously inject anti-fibronectin antibodies. The expected result is an absence of migrating PMCs, confirming the antibodies' effectiveness.", "solution": "The hypothesis asserts that fibronectin is necessary for PMC migration. By definition in experimental biology, necessity is most directly tested using a loss-of-function approach in which the function of the candidate molecule is specifically blocked; if the process fails under that blockade, this supports necessity, provided appropriate specificity and timing are considered.\n\nGiven the available tools, the most direct way to test necessity is to functionally inactivate fibronectin with blocking antibodies in otherwise normal embryos at a stage when PMCs have ingressed and would normally initiate migration along the blastocoel wall. The predicted outcome that would support necessity is that PMCs do not successfully migrate away from their origin at the vegetal pole and instead remain clustered or form aberrant aggregates, failing to reach their normal target sites for skeleton formation.\n\nEvaluating the options against this logic:\nOption A employs a loss-of-function manipulation with anti-fibronectin antibodies at the relevant developmental time. The expected outcome—PMCs failing to migrate and instead forming a clump—is the canonical phenotype indicating that fibronectin is required as a substrate for PMC migration. Among the provided choices, this experiment directly tests necessity.\n\nOption B is purely correlational: spatial overlap of PMCs with fibronectin tracks could be consistent with guidance by fibronectin but does not demonstrate that fibronectin is required. PMCs might align with fibronectin without depending on it, or both could be co-patterned by a third factor.\n\nOption C is a gain-of-function or overexpression/overabundance perturbation. Observing increased speed or mistargeting under excess fibronectin would not establish that fibronectin is necessary; it addresses sufficiency or dosage sensitivity and may introduce nonphysiological effects.\n\nOption D assesses whether fibronectin is present in the absence of PMCs, which tests whether fibronectin deposition depends on PMCs. This does not test whether PMCs require fibronectin to migrate.\n\nOption E introduces a confound by preventing PMC ingression altogether; the absence of migration under these conditions cannot be attributed to the anti-fibronectin antibodies and therefore does not test the necessity of fibronectin for migration.\n\nTherefore, the experimental design that provides the strongest evidence for necessity is to block fibronectin function and observe loss of PMC migration, as in Option A. In a full experimental setup, one would include controls such as injection of nonimmune IgG and, ideally, a rescue (for example, showing that migration is restored by reversing the blockade), but among the options given, A best satisfies the criterion for testing necessity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1716005"}, {"introduction": "The final step in creating the larval skeleton is a feat of cellular engineering, where individual PMCs cooperate to build a complex, branched structure. A key event in this process is the fusion of PMCs to form a syncytium, a multinucleated cellular cable that acts as a blueprint. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1716004] invites you to isolate this single event—cell fusion—and predict how its absence would alter the final architecture of the skeleton, thereby revealing its precise role in morphogenesis.", "problem": "In the early development of a sea urchin larva, a specific group of cells known as the Primary Mesenchyme Cells (PMCs) is solely responsible for constructing the larval skeleton. The normal process of skeletogenesis involves several key steps. First, the PMCs ingress from the vegetal plate into the fluid-filled cavity of the embryo, the blastocoel. Second, they migrate along the inner surface of the ectoderm, actively crawling until they arrange themselves into a specific ring-like pattern at the vegetal pole. Third, the PMCs extend filopodia to connect with their neighbors and subsequently fuse their cell membranes and cytoplasms, forming a syncytial cable. This continuous, multinucleated cellular network acts as a template. Finally, within the confines of this syncytial cable, the PMCs secrete and precipitate calcium carbonate, which crystallizes to form two intricate, branched skeletal elements called spicules.\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment where a sea urchin embryo is treated with a highly specific inhibitor that blocks the function of the cell fusion proteins on the surface of PMCs. This treatment has no other effects. The PMCs are still able to ingress, migrate to their correct positions to form the vegetal ring, and retain their full capacity to initiate and carry out calcium carbonate secretion. However, they are completely unable to fuse with one another to form a syncytium.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following options best describes the most likely morphology of the larval skeleton in these treated embryos?\n\nA. A multitude of small, separate spicules would be found, corresponding to the locations of the individual PMCs.\n\nB. A completely normal, branched skeleton would form, as the unfused PMCs would secrete mineral into the extracellular space to bridge the gaps between them.\n\nC. No skeleton would form at all, as the act of cell fusion is the trigger for initiating calcium carbonate secretion.\n\nD. A single, large, amorphous sphere of calcium carbonate would form in the center of the PMC ring due to uncoordinated secretion.\n\nE. Two normal spicules would form, but they would be located in random, incorrect positions within the blastocoel.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the normal sequence of events in sea urchin larval skeletogenesis. Primary Mesenchyme Cells (PMCs) (i) ingress into the blastocoel, (ii) migrate to the vegetal ring, (iii) fuse via cell fusion proteins to form a continuous syncytial cable, and (iv) secrete calcium carbonate within the lumenal space of this multicellular syncytium, which serves as a confined template for the growth of two branched spicules.\n\nGiven the hypothetical treatment, the experimental constraints are:\n- PMC ingression and migration to the correct vegetal ring position are intact.\n- PMCs retain their ability to initiate and carry out calcium carbonate secretion.\n- PMCs are completely unable to fuse; therefore, no syncytial cable forms.\n\nWe analyze the implications step by step:\n1. The positional information is preserved. Because migration and patterning to the vegetal ring occur normally, any skeletal material produced will be associated with the appropriate PMC positions, not randomly distributed elsewhere. This makes any option invoking random positioning or central aggregation unlikely.\n2. The fusion-dependent syncytial cable is absent. In the normal embryo, the syncytium creates a continuous intracellular (or syncytial) compartment that constrains and templates mineral deposition, allowing the formation of continuous, elongated, branched spicules. Without fusion, there is no continuous cable and no shared lumen in which a continuous rod can grow.\n3. Secretion occurs but is compartmentalized to individual cells. Since secretion competence is intact, PMCs will still deposit calcium carbonate. However, in the absence of a shared syncytial lumen, deposition will occur in discrete, cell-autonomous compartments or immediately adjacent to each PMC, preventing the formation of continuous spicules that span multiple cells.\n4. The expected morphology is therefore a set of multiple, small, discontinuous mineralized deposits, each associated with an individual PMC, rather than two large, continuous branched spicules.\n5. Elimination of alternatives:\n- Option B is unlikely because extracellular secretion alone, without the structural continuity of the syncytium, does not provide the coordinated, confined template necessary to bridge intercellular gaps into normal spicules.\n- Option C is unlikely because the initiation of secretion does not require cell fusion per se; only the architecture for continuous spicule growth requires fusion.\n- Option D is inconsistent with preserved positional patterning and lack of a mechanism to centralize secreted material into a single amorphous mass.\n- Option E is inconsistent with the fact that PMCs migrate correctly; mispositioning is not expected when only fusion is inhibited.\n\nTherefore, the most likely morphology is a multitude of small, separate spicules corresponding to individual PMC locations.\n\nThe correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1716004"}]}
