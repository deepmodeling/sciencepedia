In many marine invertebrates, this is achieved by an influx of sodium ions which depolarizes the membrane.\n\nConsider a hypothetical marine organism whose eggs have a different mechanism. The unfertilized egg maintains a resting membrane potential of $V_{\\text{rest}} = -70 \\text{ mV}$. The internal and external concentrations of potassium ions ($K^+$) are $[K^+]_{\\text{in}} = 400 \\text{ mM}$ and $[K^+]_{\\text{out}} = 20 \\text{ mM}$, respectively. Upon fusion with the first sperm, a massive number of new, highly-selective potassium channels open. This event increases the membrane's permeability to $K^+$ to such an extent that the membrane potential is now almost exclusively determined by the potassium ion gradient.\n\nFor this organism, an effective fast block to polyspermy is established only if the membrane potential becomes more positive than $-10 \\text{ mV}$.

The membrane potential becomes approximately -77 mV. This is a hyperpolarization, which fails to act as a block and may even facilitate further sperm entry.\n\nB. The membrane potential becomes approximately +77 mV. This is a strong depolarization that creates an effective fast block.\n\nC. The membrane potential remains at approximately -70 mV.

This thought experiment explores the critical interplay between the fast and slow blocks to polyspermy. By considering what happens if the fast block is prematurely reversed, you will appreciate why a second, permanent barrier is absolutely essential for ensuring monospermy and successful development. [@problem_id:1721581]", "problem": "In sea urchins, the prevention of polyspermy (fertilization by more than one sperm) is a critical two-step process. The first step is the \"fast block,\" a rapid, transient electrical event. Upon fusion of the first sperm, the egg's plasma membrane potential changes from a resting potential of approximately $-70 \\text{ mV}$ to a depolarized state of about $+20 \\text{ mV}$. Sperm can only fuse with a negatively charged membrane. This is followed by the \"slow block,\" a permanent mechanical barrier formed by the cortical reaction, which is typically completed within a minute after fertilization.\n\nAn experiment is conducted where sea urchin eggs are placed in a sperm-rich solution. A single sperm successfully fertilizes an egg, triggering the normal fast block depolarization to $+20 \\text{ mV}$. Precisely 10 seconds after this initial fertilization, an experimental drug called \"Repolarin\" is added to the medium. Repolarin is a fast-acting ion channel agonist that instantly and completely restores the egg's membrane potential to its original resting state of $-70 \\text{ mV}$.

The fertilization process will be reversed, and the first sperm nucleus will be ejected.\n\nE. The egg will enter a state of developmental arrest without further sperm entry.", "solution": "The key principles are that the fast block to polyspermy is a rapid membrane depolarization that prevents additional sperm fusion because sperm can only fuse with a negatively charged plasma membrane, and that the slow block, established by the cortical reaction, creates a permanent mechanical barrier but requires up to about one minute to complete.\n\nLet $V_{m}$ denote the egg plasma membrane potential. Initially, before fertilization, $V_{m}=-70 \\text{ mV}$, which is negative and permissive for sperm fusion. Upon fusion of the first sperm at time $t=0$, the fast block depolarizes the membrane to $V_{m}=+20 \\text{ mV}$. Since sperm can only fuse when the membrane is negatively charged, this depolarized state prevents any additional sperm from fusing during the fast block. The slow block (mechanical barrier) has not yet formed at this early time.\n\nAt $t=10 \\text{ s}$, Repolarin is added and is specified to instantly and completely restore $V_{m}$ to its resting value, so $V_{m}$ is returned to $-70 \\text{ mV}$. At this moment, the slow block has still not been established, so there is no mechanical barrier. Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for additional sperm fusion—namely, a negative membrane potential in the absence of the slow block—is met. Because the egg is in a sperm-rich solution, the probability of additional sperm contacting and fusing with the now-negative membrane before the slow block can be established is high.\n\nThus, after Repolarin reverses the fast block while the slow block is still absent, additional sperm are likely to fuse, resulting in polyspermy. Polyspermy leads to abnormal development, but the immediate fate in this scenario is that the egg becomes polyspermic, not normal development, lysis, reversal of the initial fertilization, or developmental arrest without further sperm entry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1721581"}]}
