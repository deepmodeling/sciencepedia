The calcium oscillations triggered by sperm penetration reactivate the oocyte cell cycle, so the first event is completion of meiosis II by the oocyte; this produces the second polar body and the haploid female pronucleus. Next, the sperm nucleus decondenses in the ooplasm, exchanging protamines for histones and assembling a nuclear envelope; this yields the male pronucleus. Once both pronuclei have formed, they migrate toward each other along microtubules organized by the sperm aster; this is pronuclear migration. Finally, the pronuclear envelopes break down and the parental genomes come together on a common mitotic spindle; this fusion of the genetic material is syngamy. Therefore, the correct chronological sequence is 3, then 4, then 2, then 1, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1688205"}, {"introduction": "Beyond knowing the sequence of events, a deeper understanding comes from quantifying the genetic material at each stage. This practice focuses on a critical moment after the pronuclei have formed and replicated their DNA, but before they fuse in syngamy. By calculating the total number of chromatids, you will solidify your understanding of the cell cycle's S phase and its impact on the zygote's preparation for the first cleavage division. [@problem_id:1688143]", "problem": "In human reproduction, fertilization involves the fusion of a sperm and an egg to form a zygote. Following fertilization, the genetic material from the sperm and the egg decondenses to form two separate nuclei within the single cell, known as the male pronucleus and the female pronucleus, respectively. Each of these pronuclei is haploid. Before the first mitotic division, or cleavage, the zygote enters the S phase of the cell cycle, during which DNA replication occurs independently within both pronuclei. The process in which the pronuclei migrate towards each other, their envelopes break down, and their chromosomes align on a single metaphase plate is called syngamy.\n\nAssuming a normal human gamete contains a haploid number of 23 chromosomes ($n=23$), calculate the total number of chromatids present within the zygote *after* DNA replication has completed in both pronuclei but *before* syngamy occurs.", "solution": "A normal human gamete is haploid with $n=23$ chromosomes. After fertilization, there are two haploid pronuclei (one male, one female), each with $n$ chromosomes. During S phase, each chromosome replicates to form two sister chromatids, so the number of chromatids per pronucleus becomes:\n$$2n.$$\nBecause there are two pronuclei within the zygote before syngamy, the total number of chromatids in the zygote is:\n$$2 \\times (2n) = 4n.$$\nSubstituting $n=23$ gives:\n$$4n = 4 \\times 23 = 92.$$\nTherefore, the zygote contains $92$ chromatids after DNA replication in both pronuclei but before syngamy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{92}$$", "id": "1688143"}, {"introduction": "Developmental biology often advances by asking \"what if?\" questions to probe the logic of cellular processes. This problem presents a hypothetical scenario where a key event—DNA replication—is selectively disrupted in one of the pronuclei. By predicting the genetic makeup of the resulting daughter cells, you will apply your knowledge of mitosis to a unique and challenging situation, honing your ability to reason from fundamental principles. [@problem_id:1688186]", "problem": "In human developmental biology, the states of a cell's genome are often described by its chromosome number and DNA content. Let $n$ represent the number of chromosomes in a single set (for humans, $n=23$), and let $C$ represent the quantity of DNA in that set. Therefore, a normal haploid human gamete (sperm or egg) is designated as (1n, 1C), and a normal diploid somatic cell in the G1 phase of the cell cycle is (2n, 2C).\n\nConsider a scenario involving in-vitro fertilization. A human oocyte is fertilized by a single sperm, forming a zygote containing a male pronucleus and a female pronucleus. Immediately after formation, an experimental drug that selectively inhibits DNA replication is applied, but due to a technical error, it only affects the male pronucleus. Consequently, the female pronucleus undergoes the S-phase (synthesis phase) normally, while the male pronucleus is prevented from doing so. The zygote then proceeds to its first mitotic cleavage, dividing into two daughter cells called blastomeres.\n\nAssuming that the mitotic spindle forms and functions correctly to segregate the chromosomes, what are the resulting chromosome numbers and DNA contents of the two blastomeres?\n\nA. Both blastomeres are (2n, 2C).\n\nB. One blastomere is (2n, 2C) and the other is (1n, 1C).\n\nC. Both blastomeres are (1.5n, 1.5C).\n\nD. One blastomere is (1n, 2C) and the other is (1n, 1C).\n\nE.

Immediately after fertilization and before S-phase, the female pronucleus is $(1n,1C)$ and the male pronucleus is $(1n,1C)$.\n\nThe drug inhibits DNA replication only in the male pronucleus. Therefore, during S-phase:\n- Female pronucleus undergoes replication: replication doubles DNA content but does not change chromosome number, so it becomes $(1n,2C)$.\n- Male pronucleus does not replicate: it remains $(1n,1C)$.\n\nAt the first mitotic division, apply the principles of mitosis:\n- For a replicated set $(1n,2C)$, sister chromatids separate to opposite poles, producing equal contributions of $(1n,1C)$ to each daughter:\n$$\\text{maternal}: (1n,2C) \\xrightarrow{\\text{mitosis}} (1n,1C) + (1n,1C).$$\n- For an unreplicated set $(1n,1C)$, there are no sister chromatids to separate.
