This problem presents a classic and striking phenotype, cyclopia, which results from a failure to establish the embryonic midline [@problem_id:1678134]. By analyzing this defect, you can deduce the identity of the critical signaling pathway responsible for ventralizing the nervous system and separating the eye fields, a core skill in developmental biology.", "problem": "A developmental biologist is studying axis formation in the zebrafish (*Danio rerio*), a powerful model organism for vertebrate development. The researcher observes a collection of mutant embryos that exhibit a severe form of holoprosencephaly. This condition is characterized by a failure of the embryonic prosencephalon (the forebrain) to sufficiently divide into the double lobes of the cerebral hemispheres. The most striking external manifestation of this defect is cyclopia, where the two eye fields have fused into a single, centrally located eye. This phenotype indicates a fundamental disruption in the establishment of the ventral midline of the developing central nervous system. Which of the following signaling pathways is most critically and directly responsible for specifying ventral cell fates in the neural tube and, therefore, whose disruption is the most likely cause of the observed cyclopia?\n\nA. Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway\n\nB. Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway\n\nC. Notch signaling pathway\n\nD. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway\n\nE. Retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway", "solution": "Goal identification: The phenotype described—holoprosencephaly with cyclopia—reflects a failure of the ventral midline to be properly specified in the anterior neural plate/forebrain, leading to failure of prosencephalon division and fusion of eye fields. Therefore, the pathway most critically and directly responsible for specifying ventral cell fates in the neural tube must be identified.\n\nPrinciple of ventral neural tube patterning: Ventral identities in the neural tube are specified by a morphogen gradient emitted from midline sources (notochord, floor plate). The canonical morphogen that fulfills this role is Sonic hedgehog (Shh), which induces the floor plate and establishes ventral neuronal identities in a dose-dependent manner. In the forebrain, Shh from the prechordal plate is crucial for establishing the ventral midline and separating the eye field into bilateral domains. Loss of Shh signaling causes holoprosencephaly and cyclopia.\n\nOption-by-option evaluation:\n- A. Wnt/$\\beta$-catenin signaling pathway: Predominantly associated with dorsal and posterior (caudalizing) patterning and proliferation. High Wnt activity promotes posterior neural fates; Wnt antagonism is required for anterior neural development. It does not directly specify ventral neural tube identities or midline separation of the forebrain.\n- B. Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway: Acts from the roof plate to dorsalize the neural tube. BMP antagonists (e.g., noggin, chordin, follistatin) from the organizer permit neural induction, but BMP itself promotes dorsal, not ventral, fates. Disruption leads to dorsal patterning defects, not primarily ventral midline failure.\n- C. Notch signaling pathway: Governs lateral inhibition, maintenance of progenitor states, boundary formation, and timing of differentiation. It is not the primary morphogen for dorsoventral identity or ventral midline specification in the neural tube.\n- D. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway: Secreted from the notochord and floor plate to ventralize the neural tube and induce floor plate identity; from the prechordal mesendoderm it patterns the ventral forebrain and is essential for eye field separation. Loss-of-function mutations in Shh or downstream components (e.g., PTCH1, SMO, GLI) classically cause holoprosencephaly and cyclopia. This directly satisfies the requirement: most critically and directly responsible for ventral fate specification and midline formation.\n- E. Retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway: Functions primarily in anteroposterior patterning, especially through regulation of Hox gene expression. While RA excess or deficiency can cause craniofacial and CNS malformations, RA is not the principal ventralizing morphogen of the neural tube and is not the most direct cause of the specific ventral midline defects leading to cyclopia.\n\nConclusion: The pathway most critically and directly responsible for specifying ventral cell fates in the neural tube, whose disruption is most likely to cause cyclopia in holoprosencephaly, is Sonic hedgehog signaling.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1678134"}, {"introduction": "The transparency of zebrafish embryos makes them ideal for live imaging, especially when combined with transgenic technology.

In the tail bud", "solution": "The reporter gene GFP will be expressed only where the engineered promoter is active. By construction, the promoter is specified to be exclusively activated in cells differentiating into skeletal muscle. Therefore, fluorescence will first appear at the earliest time and place that skeletal muscle differentiation begins.\n\nIn vertebrate embryos, including zebrafish, skeletal muscle derives from the paraxial mesoderm, which segments into somites. Somites form in an anterior-to-posterior sequence during somitogenesis. Myogenic differentiation (driven by myogenic regulatory factors such as MyoD and Myf5) initiates within the somites, specifically in the myotome, with the earliest differentiation occurring in the most anterior somites because these segments form and mature first.\n\nEvaluate the options using these developmental principles:\n- A. Most anterior somites: These are the first somites to form and differentiate into skeletal muscle; thus, they are the first location where the skeletal muscle–specific promoter will be activated and GFP fluorescence will appear.\n- B. Developing heart tube: This is cardiac muscle, not skeletal muscle, so the skeletal muscle–specific promoter would not be activated here.\n- C. Uniformly throughout the embryo: A ubiquitous pattern would require a ubiquitous promoter; the given promoter is skeletal muscle–specific, so uniform fluorescence is not expected.\n- D. Neural tube: This is neural ectoderm, not skeletal muscle; no activation of the skeletal muscle–specific promoter.\n- E. Tail bud: Posterior structures, including posterior somites, form later; the earliest fluorescence would not be here but rather in the anterior somites that differentiate first.\n\nTherefore, the first expected GFP fluorescence will be in the most anterior somites.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1678115"}, {"introduction": "Beyond fundamental research, the zebrafish model is a powerful tool for translational science, such as high-throughput drug screening.
