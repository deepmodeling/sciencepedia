Its segmented body plan is established by a cascade of gene expression, where each level of the hierarchy refines the spatial pattern laid down by the previous one. This exercise challenges you to work like a developmental geneticist, using the specific phenotype of a mutant embryo to deduce the functional class of the mutated gene within this well-defined segmentation pathway [@problem_id:1696985].", "problem": "In a genetic screen for developmental defects in the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, a biologist identifies a recessive lethal mutation. Homozygous mutant embryos proceed through early development but fail to hatch. Upon examining the cuticle preparation of these unhatched embryos, the biologist observes that while the head and thoracic segments have formed correctly, all eight abdominal segments are completely absent, resulting in a severely truncated body plan.\n\nThe formation of the segmented body plan in *Drosophila* is orchestrated by a hierarchical cascade of gene activity. Based on this well-established hierarchy, a mutation in a gene belonging to which of the following functional classes is the most direct and likely cause of the observed phenotype?\n\nA. Gap genes\n\nB. Pair-rule genes\n\nC. Segment polarity genes\n\nD. Homeotic selector (Hox) genes\n\nE. Maternal coordinate genes", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the class of segmentation gene most likely responsible for a specific phenotype in a *Drosophila* embryo: the complete absence of the abdominal region, while the head and thorax are normal. To solve this, we must analyze the function of each gene class in the segmentation hierarchy.\n\nThe establishment of the *Drosophila* body plan follows a strict hierarchy:\n1.  **Maternal Coordinate Genes:** These genes, such as *bicoid* and *nanos*, are transcribed in the mother's nurse cells and their mRNA is deposited into the oocyte. Their protein products form concentration gradients along the anterior-posterior axis after fertilization. *Bicoid* protein specifies anterior structures (head and thorax), while *Nanos* protein is required for the formation of posterior structures (abdomen). A mutation in *nanos* would indeed lead to the loss of abdominal segments. However, these genes are at the very top of the hierarchy, providing the initial spatial information for the zygotic genome.\n\n2.  **Gap Genes:** These are the first zygotic genes to be expressed in response to the maternal coordinate gene gradients. Genes like *hunchback*, *Krüppel*, *knirps*, and *giant* are expressed in broad, overlapping domains along the anterior-posterior axis. Their function is to divide the embryo into large, multi-segmental regions. Crucially, a mutation in a gap gene results in the deletion of a large, contiguous block of segments corresponding to the region where that gene is normally expressed. For example, a null mutation in the gap gene *knirps* is known to cause the loss of abdominal segments A1 through A7. This perfectly matches the phenotype described in the problem—the loss of the entire abdominal region.\n\n3.  **Pair-Rule Genes:** These genes, such as *even-skipped* and *fushi tarazu*, are regulated by the gap genes. They are expressed in a pattern of seven transverse stripes along the embryo. Their function is to divide the broad domains established by gap genes into smaller units, establishing the 14-parasegment plan of the embryo. A mutation in a pair-rule gene results in the deletion of every other segment, leading to an embryo with only half the normal number of segments. This pattern of alternating deletions is inconsistent with the observed phenotype of a single, large deletion of the entire abdomen.\n\n4.  **Segment Polarity Genes:** These genes, such as *engrailed* and *wingless*, are expressed in a repeating pattern in a single stripe within each of the 14 parasegments. They function to define the anterior and posterior compartments within each individual segment and to reinforce segment boundaries. A mutation in a segment polarity gene causes defects in every segment, typically a deletion of one part of the segment and a mirror-image duplication of the remaining part. This also does not match the observed phenotype.\n\n5.  **Homeotic Selector (Hox) Genes:** These genes are activated later and are regulated by the combination of gap and pair-rule genes. Their role is not to create segments, but to provide each segment with its unique identity (e.g., determining which segment grows legs, wings, or halteres). A mutation in a Hox gene causes a homeotic transformation, where one body part is replaced by another (e.g., legs growing in place of antennae). It does not cause the deletion of segments.\n\nComparing the options, both maternal coordinate genes (E) and gap genes (A) can cause the loss of the abdomen. However, the gap genes are the first tier of the *zygotic* segmentation cascade that directly subdivides the embryo into large regions. The loss of a large, contiguous block of segments is the classic, defining phenotype for a mutation in a gap gene. Therefore, a gap gene mutation is the most direct and specific explanation for the observed phenotype.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1696985"}, {"introduction": "While genetic screens reveal which genes are necessary for development, classic embryological experiments can tell us how tissues behave and interact. The chick embryo, with its accessibility for surgical manipulation, is a perfect model for such studies. This problem presents a classic somite rotation experiment, asking you to interpret its outcome to understand how pre-determined patterns within a tissue can guide the migration of cells and axons, a fundamental process in building the nervous system [@problem_id:1696999].", "problem": "In developmental biology, the segmented organization of the vertebrate body plan is established by the sequential formation of somites from the presomitic mesoderm. Each somite subsequently differentiates into the dermomyotome and the sclerotome. The sclerotome, in particular, gives rise to the vertebrae and ribs. During early embryogenesis, neural crest cells and the axons of motor neurons must navigate through the somitic environment to reach their targets.\n\nConsider a classic experiment performed on a chick embryo. A single, newly formed thoracic somite is surgically excised. This somite is then rotated 180 degrees about its anteroposterior (A-P) axis and carefully reimplanted into its original location. After a period of further development, the migration patterns of neural crest cells and motor axons originating from the adjacent segment of the neural tube are observed. The result is that these cells and axons do not migrate through the half of the reimplanted somite that is now positioned anteriorly (closer to the head). Instead, they are observed to migrate exclusively through the half of the somite that is now positioned posteriorly (closer to the tail).\n\nBased on this experimental outcome, what is the most accurate conclusion that can be drawn regarding the guidance of these migrating cells and axons?\n\nA. The anteroposterior polarity of the somite is intrinsically determined before neural crest and axon migration, and this pre-patterned polarity dictates their subsequent migration pathways.\n\nB. Neural crest cells are responsible for inducing a permissive migratory environment by secreting signaling factors that alter the character of the somite tissue they first encounter.\n\nC. The notochord provides a dominant, long-range attractive signal that defines the migratory corridor, effectively overriding any local molecular cues present within the somite itself.\n\nD. The polarity of a somite is highly plastic and is rapidly re-specified by inductive signals from the overlying surface ectoderm and the adjacent neural tube after its surgical manipulation.\n\nE. Motor axons act as pioneers that enzymatically degrade extracellular matrix molecules to create a path, which is then passively followed by the migrating neural crest cell population.", "solution": "1. Known developmental principle: Each sclerotome is subdivided into an anterior (rostral) half that is permissive for neural crest cell and motor axon migration, and a posterior (caudal) half that is non-permissive due to repellent cues (for example, ephrin family members, semaphorins, and specific extracellular matrix components). This intrinsic anteroposterior polarity within each somite governs the segmental pathways used by migrating neural crest cells and motor axons.\n\n2. Surgical manipulation: Rotating a single somite by 180 degrees about its anteroposterior axis swaps the positions of its intrinsic anterior and posterior halves relative to the embryo’s global anteroposterior coordinates, but does not alter the intrinsic identity of those halves within the somite tissue itself at the time of rotation.\n\n3. Experimental observation: After rotation and reimplantation, neural crest cells and motor axons avoid the half now positioned anteriorly and migrate exclusively through the half now positioned posteriorly. Interpreted with respect to the somite’s original intrinsic identity, the half now posterior was originally the anterior (permissive) half, and the half now anterior was originally the posterior (non-permissive) half.\n\n4. Deduction: The migrating cells and axons are reading pre-existing, local cues in the somite that are preserved through the manipulation. If long-range cues such as those from the notochord were dominant, or if rapid respecification of polarity by surrounding tissues occurred, migration would align with the embryo’s positional coordinates rather than with the somite’s original intrinsic halves. Similarly, if neural crest cells or motor axons were primarily responsible for creating the permissive path de novo, the observed strict adherence to the somite’s pre-patterned halves would not be expected.\n\n5. Evaluation of options:\n- A is supported: The result demonstrates that anteroposterior polarity is intrinsically specified in the somite before neural crest and axon migration and that this pre-pattern locally dictates the migratory pathway.\n- B is contradicted: Neural crest cells do not reprogram the first half they encounter; they avoid a rotated posterior (non-permissive) half.\n- C is contradicted: A putative dominant long-range attractant does not override local somite cues.\n- D is contradicted: Rapid respecification by ectoderm or neural tube would predict migration through the half now anterior, which is not observed.\n- E is contradicted: The path is defined by somite-derived polarity rather than by axon-mediated ECM degradation, and in trunk regions neural crest migration typically precedes motor axon outgrowth.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that somite anteroposterior polarity is intrinsically determined and directs migration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1696999"}, {"introduction": "Modern developmental biology combines the logic of genetics with the precision of molecular engineering and quantitative analysis. The zebrafish, with its transparent embryos and amenability to genetic modification, is at the forefront of this research.

To achieve temporal control over gene disruption and bypass any earlier lethal effects, the researcher utilizes an inducible Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system.\n\nTwo stable transgenic zebrafish lines are created:\n1.  **Line A**: Fish in this line are homozygous for a transgene that places the Cas9 nuclease gene under the control of a heat-shock promoter. This means Cas9 is only expressed when the fish is subjected to a significant temperature increase. The transgene is integrated on chromosome 3.\n2.  **Line B**: Fish in this line are homozygous for a different transgene that leads to the ubiquitous and constant expression of a single guide RNA (`sgRNA`) designed to target the `fmg` gene. This transgene is integrated on chromosome 10.\n\nA researcher crosses a fish from Line A with a fish from Line B to produce an F1 generation. These F1 larvae are raised to the appropriate developmental stage for pectoral fin formation.
