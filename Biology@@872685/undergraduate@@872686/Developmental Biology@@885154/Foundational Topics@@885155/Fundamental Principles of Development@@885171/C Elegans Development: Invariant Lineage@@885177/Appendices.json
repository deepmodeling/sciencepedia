The development of every somatic cell in the adult worm can be traced back to one of six founder cells that are established early in embryogenesis. These founder cells are named AB, MS, E, C, D, and P4. Each of these blastomeres is fated to give rise to a specific set of tissues and organs.\n\nA developmental biologist is studying a mutant strain of *C. elegans*. Upon inspection of the newly hatched larvae, they observe a consistent and lethal phenotype: the worms are viable for a short period but completely lack an intestine. Further analysis reveals that other major structures, including the majority of the nervous system, the pharynx, body wall muscles, and the hypodermis (skin), are all present and appear structurally normal. The germline is also properly specified.\n\nBased on this specific defect, which one of the following founder cells most likely failed in its developmental program, leading to the observed phenotype?\n\nA.

P4", "solution": "We start from the developmental principle that in Caenorhabditis elegans each of the six embryonic founder cells makes largely invariant and specific contributions:\n- AB generates the majority of the nervous system, much of the hypodermis, and part of the pharynx.\n- MS generates portions of the pharynx, body wall muscles, and somatic gonad.\n- E generates the endoderm, which in C. elegans is the intestine.\n- C generates body wall muscles, hypodermis, and some neurons.\n- D generates body wall muscles.\n- P4 generates the germline.\n\nThe observed phenotype is a complete absence of intestine, with normal-appearing nervous system, pharynx, body wall muscle, and hypodermis, and a properly specified germline. Mapping these structures to founder cells:\n- Normal nervous system and hypodermis argue that AB functioned.\n- Normal pharynx and body wall muscle argue that MS and C (and D for muscle) functioned.\n- Proper germline argues that P4 functioned.\n- The specific and complete absence of intestine indicates failure of the E lineage, since E uniquely gives rise to the endodermal intestine in C. elegans.\n\nTherefore, the founder cell most likely to have failed in its developmental program is E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1673671"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the broad fates of the founder cells, the complete lineage map of *C. elegans* is a detailed family tree where every cell has a unique name and position.

Every cell division, from the single-celled zygote to the 959 somatic cells of the adult hermaphrodite, has been recorded. The lineage is described using a branching nomenclature. A mother cell, `X`, divides into two daughter cells, typically named `X.a` (anterior) and `X.p` (posterior).
