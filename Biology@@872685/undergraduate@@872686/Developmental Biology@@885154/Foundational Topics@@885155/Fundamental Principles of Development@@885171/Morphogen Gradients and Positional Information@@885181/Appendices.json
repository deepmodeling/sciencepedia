Dorsalin is a protein secreted by a group of cells at the anterior pole. It diffuses towards the posterior, establishing a stable, monotonically decreasing concentration gradient. The fate of cells along this axis is determined by the local concentration of Dorsalin, $[D]$, according to a simple genetic regulatory network:\n\n- Gene *azure* is expressed if and only if $[D]  C_A$.\n- Gene *blanche* is expressed if and only if $C_B  [D] \\le C_A$.\n- Gene *carmine* is expressed if and only if $[D] \\le C_B$.\n\nHere, $C_A$ and $C_B$ are distinct concentration thresholds, with $C_A  C_B  0$.
