The root has a diameter $d$.\nThe upper surface of the root is at a distance of $d/2$ from the central axis, farther from the center of curvature. Therefore, its path follows an arc with a radius of curvature $R_u = R + \\frac{d}{2}$.\nThe lower surface of the root is also at a distance of $d/2$ from the central axis, but closer to the center of curvature. Its path follows an arc with a radius of curvature $R_l = R - \\frac{d}{2}$.\n\nLet's consider the root bending through a small angle $d\\theta$ in an infinitesimal time interval $dt$.
