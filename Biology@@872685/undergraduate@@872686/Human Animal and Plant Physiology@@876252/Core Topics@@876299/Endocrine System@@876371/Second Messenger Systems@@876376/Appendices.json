The binding of its native hormone, a peptide called 'Relaxin-H', to this receptor triggers the activation of adenylyl cyclase, leading to an increase in intracellular cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) concentration, which serves as a second messenger. The pharmacologist aims to characterize two new synthetic compounds, 'Antablock-C' and 'Antablock-N', as potential antagonists.\n\nTo do this, she prepares a cell culture line expressing this receptor and measures the intracellular cAMP concentration in response to varying concentrations of Relaxin-H. She performs this dose-response analysis under three conditions:\n1.  In the absence of any antagonist (control).\n2.  In the presence of a fixed, high concentration of Antablock-C.\n3.  In the presence of a fixed, high concentration of Antablock-N.\n\nFrom background knowledge, it is known that Antablock-C is a **competitive antagonist**, binding reversibly to the same site as Relaxin-H. Antablock-N is a **non-competitive antagonist**, binding to an allosteric site on the receptor, which prevents signal transduction even if Relaxin-H is bound to its normal site.\n\nLet $E_{max}$ represent the maximum possible cAMP concentration achievable (efficacy), and let $EC_{50}$ represent the concentration of Relaxin-H required to produce 50% of the maximal response (potency). Based on the mechanisms of these two antagonists, which of the following statements correctly describes the expected changes to the dose-response curve of Relaxin-H in the presence of each compound, relative to the control?\n\nA. Antablock-C reduces $E_{max}$ with no significant change in $EC_{50}$. Antablock-N increases $EC_{50}$ with no change in $E_{max}$.\n\nB. Antablock-C increases $EC_{50}$ with no change in $E_{max}$.
