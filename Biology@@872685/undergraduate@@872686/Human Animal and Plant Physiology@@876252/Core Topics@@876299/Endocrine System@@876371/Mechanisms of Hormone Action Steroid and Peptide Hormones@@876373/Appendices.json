This first exercise [@problem_id:1717572] presents a hypothetical scenario involving a modified steroid hormone that is physically prevented from entering its target cell. By predicting the cellular response, you will reinforce the critical principle that lipophilic steroid hormones must cross the cell membrane to access their intracellular receptors, a requirement not shared by peptide hormones that act on cell-surface receptors.", "problem": "In a cell biology laboratory, a research team synthesizes a novel compound called \"Androlexin.\" Androlexin is derived from the steroid hormone testosterone by covalently attaching it to a large, inert, hydrophilic polymer. This modification makes the entire Androlexin complex too large and polar to diffuse across the cell membrane.\n\nThe team tests Androlexin on a culture of target cells that are known to respond to two different native hormones:\n1.  **Testosterone**: A steroid hormone that binds to its specific intracellular receptor, leading to the transcription and synthesis of \"Protein G.\"\n2.  **Epinephrine**: A peptide hormone that binds to its specific beta-adrenergic receptor on the cell surface, initiating a signaling cascade that results in the rapid phosphorylation and activation of \"Enzyme P.\"\n\nThe target cells possess both the intracellular receptors for testosterone and the cell-surface receptors for epinephrine. Assuming that the Androlexin molecule does not undergo cleavage and that its testosterone component retains its three-dimensional shape required for receptor binding, what is the most likely outcome when Androlexin is added to the cell culture?\n\nA.

The cells will synthesize a new transport protein to actively import Androlexin, leading to the synthesis of Protein G.\n\nE. Both Protein G will be synthesized and Enzyme P will be activated.", "solution": "1) Identify the normal signaling mechanisms of the two native hormones in the target cells:\n- Testosterone is a lipophilic steroid that normally diffuses across the plasma membrane to bind an intracellular receptor (cytosolic or nuclear). This receptor-hormone complex acts as a transcription factor to induce gene expression, leading to synthesis of Protein G. This requires the hormone to cross the membrane.\n- Epinephrine (a peptide/amine hormone) binds to a specific cell-surface beta-adrenergic receptor. Ligand binding initiates a G protein-coupled receptor signaling cascade resulting in rapid phosphorylation and activation of Enzyme P. This requires a ligand with appropriate structure for the beta-adrenergic receptor; it does not require membrane permeation by the ligand.\n\n2) Analyze the properties of Androlexin:\n- It is testosterone covalently attached to a large, inert, hydrophilic polymer. This makes the complex too large and polar to diffuse across the cell membrane.\n- The testosterone moiety retains the three-dimensional shape needed for binding the intracellular testosterone receptor, but the complex does not undergo cleavage; therefore, the testosterone moiety never becomes free to cross the membrane or to be released intracellularly.\n- The polymer is inert and does not by itself act as a ligand for any known receptor in the problem.\n\n3) Predict intracellular receptor engagement:\n- Because Androlexin cannot cross the plasma membrane and is not cleaved, it cannot reach intracellular testosterone receptors. Therefore, the receptor-hormone complex cannot form, and transcriptional activation leading to Protein G synthesis will not occur.\n\n4) Evaluate potential activation of the beta-adrenergic (epinephrine) receptor:\n- Activation of the beta-adrenergic receptor requires a ligand with the specific structure of epinephrine (or a suitable agonist). Androlexin consists of testosterone plus a hydrophilic polymer; it does not mimic epinephrine’s structure and is not expected to bind or activate beta-adrenergic receptors.\n- The statement that the testosterone moiety retains the conformation needed for receptor binding pertains to the intracellular androgen receptor, not the beta-adrenergic receptor. There is no basis for cross-reactivity.\n\n5) Exclude alternative mechanisms:\n- Cells will not spontaneously synthesize a novel transport protein specifically to import Androlexin; such an event would itself require prior gene regulation and evolutionary adaptation, and there is no provided receptor or transporter to initiate such a response.\n- Endocytosis or nonspecific uptake would not deliver intact Androlexin to the cytosol or nucleus for intracellular receptor engagement, and the problem explicitly states no cleavage occurs, preventing release of free testosterone.\n\n6) Conclusion:\n- Protein G synthesis will not be induced.\n- Enzyme P will not be activated.\n- Therefore, neither process occurs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1717572"}, {"introduction": "Cell surface receptors are elegant molecular machines with distinct modules for distinct jobs: one part recognizes the signal, and another part transmits it. This problem [@problem_id:1717562] challenges you to predict the outcome of a genetically engineered \"chimeric\" receptor, which creatively combines the ligand-binding domain of the insulin receptor with the intracellular signaling domain of the glucagon receptor. This practice brilliantly demonstrates that ligand specificity and the resulting intracellular cascade are separable functions, deepening your understanding of how receptor structure dictates function.", "problem": "In a molecular biology experiment, a genetic construct is created to express a novel chimeric receptor in a line of cultured human liver cells. This chimeric receptor is composed of two distinct functional parts: the extracellular ligand-binding domain is taken from the human insulin receptor, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase, while the transmembrane and intracellular domains are taken from the human glucagon receptor, which is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR).\n\nUnder normal physiological conditions:\n- The insulin receptor, upon binding insulin, undergoes autophosphorylation on its intracellular tyrosine residues. This initiates a phosphorylation cascade involving the Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, ultimately promoting glucose uptake and storage.\n- The glucagon receptor, upon binding glucagon, activates an associated stimulatory G-protein (Gs). The Gs protein in turn activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, which synthesizes the second messenger cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP). This increase in cAMP activates Protein Kinase A (PKA), leading to increased glucose production (gluconeogenesis) and release.\n\nThese engineered liver cells, which express only the new chimeric receptor for these pathways, are incubated in a medium containing a physiological concentration of insulin. Which of the following cellular events will be the most direct and immediate consequence of insulin binding to this chimeric receptor?\n\nA. Autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the receptor's intracellular domain.\n\nB. A significant increase in the activity of the PI3K signaling pathway.\n\nC. A rapid increase in the activity of Protein Kinase A (PKA).\n\nD. Dissociation of the Gs protein alpha subunit, leading to the activation of adenylyl cyclase.\n\nE. Binding of the Grb2 adaptor protein to the receptor's intracellular domain.", "solution": "The chimeric receptor has the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the insulin receptor and the transmembrane plus intracellular domains of the glucagon receptor, a Gs-coupled GPCR. Ligand specificity is determined by the extracellular domain, so insulin will bind and activate this receptor. However, the downstream signaling is dictated by the intracellular domain. For GPCRs, the immediate consequence of ligand binding is receptor-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange on the associated heterotrimeric G protein, specifically promoting GDP release and GTP binding on the Gs alpha subunit. This leads to dissociation of the Gs alpha subunit from the beta-gamma complex and activation of adenylyl cyclase. The rise in cAMP and subsequent activation of Protein Kinase A occur after this G protein activation step.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues requires a receptor tyrosine kinase intracellular domain, which this chimera lacks.\n- Option B is incorrect because PI3K activation is downstream of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, not GPCR signaling.\n- Option C is downstream of cAMP generation and is not the most immediate event.\n- Option D correctly describes the immediate GPCR event triggered by this chimera: Gs alpha dissociation and activation of adenylyl cyclase.\n- Option E requires phosphotyrosine docking sites on an RTK, which are absent here.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and immediate consequence is dissociation of the Gs alpha subunit leading to activation of adenylyl cyclase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1717562"}, {"introduction": "Having established where steroid hormones act, we now delve into *how* they regulate gene expression at the molecular level. This practice [@problem_id:1717520] models a clinically relevant scenario of hormone resistance in cancer, involving a mutant receptor that interferes with the function of the normal receptor. By deriving an expression for the effect of this \"dominant-negative\" variant, you will develop a quantitative understanding of receptor dimerization and DNA binding, which are crucial steps in steroid hormone-mediated gene activation.", "problem": "Certain types of hormone-resistant cancers are associated with mutations in nuclear hormone receptors. Consider a cell line that expresses two forms of the estrogen receptor (ER): the full-length wild-type receptor (ER-WT) and a truncated variant (ER-DN). The ER-DN variant arises from an alternative splicing event and lacks its DNA-binding domain, but its ligand-binding and dimerization domains remain intact and functional.\n\nThe normal signaling pathway involves the steroid hormone estrogen binding to an ER monomer, which then induces dimerization. Only a dimer composed of two ER-WT subunits (a WT-WT homodimer) is capable of binding to specific DNA sequences called Estrogen Response Elements (EREs) to activate gene transcription. Dimerization can occur between any two receptor monomers, forming WT-WT homodimers, DN-DN homodimers, or WT-DN heterodimers. Assume that the presence of even one ER-DN subunit in a dimer is sufficient to prevent the entire dimer from binding to DNA, rendering it transcriptionally inactive.\n\nWe make the following simplifying assumptions for our model:\n1.  Both ER-WT and ER-DN are expressed, and the total cellular concentration of receptor protein (both forms combined) is constant.\n2.  The dimerization process is highly efficient, such that nearly all receptor monomers are found within a dimer.\n3.  The formation of the three possible dimer types (WT-WT, WT-DN, DN-DN) occurs through random statistical association of the available monomer subunits. This implies that the intrinsic affinity for dimerization is identical between any two receptor subunits, regardless of whether they are WT or DN.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ be the fraction of the total receptor protein pool that is the truncated ER-DN variant, where $0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$. Consequently, the fraction of the wild-type ER-WT is $(1-\\alpha)$. The overall transcriptional response, or an activity signal $A$, is directly proportional to the concentration of functional WT-WT homodimers. Let $A_{max}$ denote the maximum possible activity, which is achieved when only the wild-type receptor is present (i.e., at $\\alpha = 0$).\n\nDerive a closed-form analytic expression for the fractional activity, $\\frac{A}{A_{max}}$, as a function of $\\alpha$.", "solution": "Let the total concentration of receptor monomers (WT plus DN) be denoted by $R_{\\text{tot}}$, which is constant by assumption. The fraction of ER-DN monomers is $\\alpha$, so the fraction of ER-WT monomers is $(1-\\alpha)$. Therefore, the monomer concentrations are $(1-\\alpha)R_{\\text{tot}}$ for ER-WT and $\\alpha R_{\\text{tot}}$ for ER-DN.\n\nBy assumption, dimerization is highly efficient, so essentially all monomers are in dimers. Thus, the total concentration of dimers is\n$$\nD_{\\text{tot}}=\\frac{R_{\\text{tot}}}{2}.\n$$\n\nRandom statistical association with identical dimerization affinity implies that the fraction of dimers of each type is given by the product of the corresponding monomer fractions, with a factor of $2$ for heterodimers due to the two possible orderings. Denote $f_{\\text{WT}}=1-\\alpha$ and $f_{\\text{DN}}=\\alpha$. Then the dimer fractions are\n$$\nf_{\\text{WT-WT}}=f_{\\text{WT}}^{2}=(1-\\alpha)^{2},\\quad f_{\\text{WT-DN}}=2f_{\\text{WT}}f_{\\text{DN}}=2\\alpha(1-\\alpha),\\quad f_{\\text{DN-DN}}=f_{\\text{DN}}^{2}=\\alpha^{2}.\n$$\n\nOnly WT-WT dimers are functional.
