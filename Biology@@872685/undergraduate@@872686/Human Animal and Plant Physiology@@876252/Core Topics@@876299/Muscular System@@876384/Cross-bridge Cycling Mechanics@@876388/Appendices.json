This exercise explores the consequences of complete ATP depletion, a scenario that reveals the crucial, dual role of ATP in muscle contraction. By analyzing this condition, you will pinpoint the exact step where the cycle arrests and understand the molecular basis of the physiological state known as rigor mortis [@problem_id:1702111].", "problem": "In skeletal muscle contraction, the cross-bridge cycle describes the series of events where myosin heads pull on actin filaments. This process is critically dependent on the availability of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). Consider a hypothetical scenario where a muscle cell has completely exhausted its supply of ATP. The muscle becomes stiff and unable to relax.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly identifies the specific state of the myosin head within the arrested cross-bridge cycle and the name given to this physiological condition?\n\nA. The myosin head is detached from actin and in its high-energy \"cocked\" conformation; this state is called flaccid paralysis.\n\nB. The myosin head is firmly bound to the actin filament after the power stroke has occurred; this state is called rigor mortis.\n\nC. The myosin head is detached from actin but in its low-energy conformation, unable to be re-energized; this state is called tetany.\n\nD. The myosin head binds to the actin filament but is unable to perform the power stroke; this state is called contracture.\n\nE. The myosin head is in the process of hydrolyzing a non-existent ATP molecule, trapping it in an intermediate state; this state is called spastic paralysis.", "solution": "The cross-bridge cycle can be tracked by explicit biochemical states of the myosin head and its ligands:\n1) In the energized, cocked conformation, myosin carries hydrolysis products and is commonly represented as $M\\cdot ADP\\cdot P_{i}$. With $Ca^{2+}$ exposing actin sites, it forms a weak-to-strong cross-bridge: $A\\cdot M\\cdot ADP\\cdot P_{i}$.\n2) The power stroke is triggered by release of $P_{i}$, followed by release of $ADP$, yielding the strongly bound rigor complex $A\\cdot M$.\n3) Detachment requires binding of ATP to myosin; ATP binding decreases myosin’s affinity for actin, producing $M\\cdot ATP$ and dissociation from actin: $A\\cdot M \\xrightarrow{+ATP} A + M\\cdot ATP$.\n4) Re-cocking requires ATP hydrolysis: $M\\cdot ATP \\rightarrow M\\cdot ADP\\cdot P_{i}$, restoring the high-energy conformation.\n\nTherefore, ATP has two essential roles: it is required for detachment (by forming $M\\cdot ATP$) and for re-cocking (by hydrolysis to $M\\cdot ADP\\cdot P_{i}$). In the hypothetical case where ATP is completely exhausted, the system arrests at the post–power-stroke, strongly bound rigor complex $A\\cdot M$, because the step $A\\cdot M \\xrightarrow{+ATP} A + M\\cdot ATP$ cannot occur when $[ATP]\\rightarrow 0$. This produces stiffness and inability to relax, the hallmark of rigor mortis.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because detachment and the cocked, high-energy $M\\cdot ADP\\cdot P_{i}$ state require ATP binding and hydrolysis; with no ATP, myosin cannot be detached and cocked.\n- B is correct: the myosin head remains firmly bound to actin after the power stroke (rigor complex), and the condition is rigor mortis.\n- C is incorrect because the low-energy detached state is not sustained in ATP depletion; detachment requires ATP. Tetany refers to high-frequency stimulation with ATP present.\n- D is incorrect because the block in ATP depletion is detachment, not the power stroke itself; “contracture” can involve sustained contraction, but the defining ATP-exhaustion arrest is rigor.\n- E is incorrect because hydrolysis requires ATP; there is no “intermediate” with a non-existent substrate, and spastic paralysis is an upper motor neuron phenomenon.\n\nThus, the correct choice is the rigor complex and rigor mortis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1702111"}, {"introduction": "Building on the fundamental role of ATP, we can dissect the cycle further using tools of biochemistry. This problem introduces a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, a molecule that mimics ATP binding but resists being broken down for energy.

They are using an isolated skeletal muscle fiber that has been chemically permeabilized, allowing direct access to the contractile machinery. The fiber is placed in a solution containing a high concentration of calcium ions (Ca$^{2+}$) to ensure the troponin-tropomyosin complex has exposed the myosin-binding sites on the actin filaments. The fiber is actively contracting.\n\nThe researchers then introduce a high concentration of Adenosine-5'-[$\\beta$,$\\gamma$-imido]triphosphate (AMP-PNP), a synthetic analog of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). AMP-PNP is structurally similar to ATP and can bind to the ATP-binding site on the myosin head, but the bond between its second and third phosphate groups is resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis.\n\nAssuming the muscle fiber was in a state of active contraction, with cross-bridges cycling normally just before the introduction of AMP-PNP, what is the fate of the myosin heads? Specifically, identify the last step of the cross-bridge cycle that is successfully completed and the first subsequent step that is blocked by the presence of AMP-PNP.\n\nA.

The pCa value at which force is half-maximal is denoted as pCa₅₀.\n\nFor a normal, wild-type (WT) muscle fiber, experiments show a Hill coefficient of $n_H = 4.2$. A genetic mutation is then introduced into this fiber's troponin C, the calcium-sensing protein complex that initiates contraction. This mutation causes the troponin C to bind calcium with an affinity that is exactly 3.0 times greater than that of the wild-type protein. Assume that this mutation does not change the Hill coefficient $n_H$ or the maximum force $F_{\\text{max}}$.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the isometric force generated by the mutant (MT) fiber to the force generated by the wild-type (WT) fiber, $F_{MT} / F_{WT}$, when both fibers are exposed to a calcium concentration that corresponds precisely to the pCa₅₀ of the wild-type fiber.
