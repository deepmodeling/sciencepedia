They note that while most bands and lines change in width, one specific zone, which is clearly visible as a lighter region in the center of the dark band in the relaxed muscle, completely vanishes in the maximally contracted muscle myofibril.\n\nBased on the sliding filament model of muscle contraction, which of the following structures disappears upon maximal contraction?\n\nA.

Therefore, the A band length remains constant.\n- I band: the region containing only thin filaments, spanning from the end of one A band to the beginning of the next; as thin filaments slide inward over the thick filaments, the non-overlap region decreases, so the I band narrows.\n- H zone: the central lighter region within the A band where there is only thick filament (no thin filament overlap) in the relaxed state; as contraction increases overlap, this non-overlap region decreases and can vanish at maximal contraction.\n- M line: the midline of the sarcomere where thick filaments are anchored; it remains present structurally.\n- Z disc: defines sarcomere boundaries; Z discs move closer together but do not disappear.\n\nTranslate the above to symbolic statements about band/zone widths:\n- Let $L_{A}$ be the A band length; then $L_{A}=\\text{constant}$ during contraction.\n- Let $L_{I}$ be the I band width; then $L_{I}$ decreases with increasing overlap.\n- Let $L_{H}$ be the H zone width; then as thin filaments slide toward the M line, overlap within the A band increases until, at maximal isometric contraction, $L_{H}\\to 0$.\n- The M line and Z discs persist structurally; they do not vanish.\n\nMatch to the observation in electron micrographs:\n- The “lighter region in the center of the dark band” visible in relaxed muscle is the H zone within the A band.\n- Upon maximal contraction, the H zone disappears due to complete overlap of thin and thick filaments in the A band, consistent with $L_{H}=0$.\n\nTherefore, the structure that disappears at maximal contraction is the H zone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1756593"}, {"introduction": "Having visualized the sliding filaments, we now zoom in on the molecular engine driving this movement: the cross-bridge cycle. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1756567] uses a hypothetical non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue to dissect the cycle's critical steps. It forces you to distinguish between the role of ATP *binding* (which causes detachment) and ATP *hydrolysis* (which energizes the myosin head), clarifying why both are essential for sustained contraction.", "problem": "The contraction of a skeletal muscle fiber is driven by the cross-bridge cycle, a series of molecular events involving the thick filament protein, myosin, and the thin filament protein, actin. This process is critically dependent on the binding and hydrolysis of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario where a skeletal muscle fiber is permeated with a solution containing a high concentration of an ATP analogue, let's call it \"non-hydrolyzable ATP\" or \"nhATP\". This molecule has the following properties:\n1. It binds to the ATP-binding site on the myosin head with the same affinity as natural ATP.\n2. The bond between its terminal phosphate groups is exceptionally stable and cannot be broken (hydrolyzed) by the myosin's ATPase activity.\n\nIf this nhATP is introduced at a concentration that vastly outcompetes the cell's natural ATP for binding to myosin heads, what would be the resulting state of the majority of myosin heads within the muscle fiber's sarcomeres?\n\nA. The myosin heads will be trapped in the \"rigor\" state, strongly bound to the actin filaments.\n\nB. The myosin heads will be in a detached, high-energy conformation, prepared to execute a power stroke.\n\nC. The myosin heads will be in a detached, low-energy conformation, unable to bind to actin.\n\nD. The myosin heads will continuously execute the power stroke without detaching from the actin filaments, causing maximum sustained tension.", "solution": "The cross-bridge cycle can be represented by the following nucleotide- and actin-binding states of myosin:\n\n1. Strong-binding, nucleotide-free rigor state: $AM$ (actomyosin without bound nucleotide).\n2. ATP binding induces detachment: $AM + \\mathrm{ATP} \\to M\\mathrm{ATP} + A$. This step is driven by the principle that ATP binding to myosin reduces its affinity for actin, causing dissociation.\n3. Hydrolysis and cocking: $M\\mathrm{ATP} \\xrightarrow{\\text{ATPase}} M\\mathrm{ADP}\\cdot \\mathrm{P_{i}}$. Hydrolysis stores energy in the myosin head and places it in a high-energy, cocked conformation with weak actin affinity.\n4. Weak binding and force generation: $M\\mathrm{ADP}\\cdot \\mathrm{P_{i}} + A \\leftrightarrow AM\\mathrm{ADP}\\cdot \\mathrm{P_{i}}$, followed by $\\mathrm{P_{i}}$ release to trigger the power stroke and then ADP release, returning toward $AM$ until ATP binds again.\n\nNow consider the introduction of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, $\\mathrm{nhATP}$, with the properties:\n- It binds the ATP site with the same affinity as ATP.\n- It cannot be hydrolyzed by myosin ATPase.\n\nAt high $\\mathrm{nhATP}$ concentration that outcompetes ATP, the dominant reactions are:\n$$AM + \\mathrm{nhATP} \\to M\\mathrm{nhATP} + A.$$\nBecause $\\mathrm{nhATP}$ cannot be hydrolyzed, the transition\n$$M\\mathrm{nhATP} \\not\\to M\\mathrm{ADP}\\cdot \\mathrm{P_{i}}$$\ndoes not occur. Therefore, myosin remains in the $\\mathrm{ATP}$-bound conformation, which is detached from actin and has low actin affinity. Without hydrolysis, the myosin head does not enter the cocked, high-energy $M\\mathrm{ADP}\\cdot \\mathrm{P_{i}}$ state and thus is not prepared to execute a power stroke. Moreover, because a nucleotide is bound, the rigor state $AM$ is not populated. Continuous power strokes are impossible without the hydrolysis and product-release steps.\n\nThus, the majority of myosin heads will be in the detached, low-energy conformation with $\\mathrm{nhATP}$ bound and unable to bind actin strongly.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1756567"}, {"introduction": "Muscle function depends on both rapid contraction and equally rapid relaxation.

The rate constant, $k$, is directly proportional to the total activity of the SERCA pumps in the muscle fiber. The total activity is the product of the number of pumps and the average activity per pump.\n3.  The \"relaxation half-time,\" $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time it takes for the sarcoplasmic Ca²⁺ concentration to decrease from its peak value at the start of relaxation to 50% of that peak value.\n\nIn a control experiment on an isolated muscle fiber, the relaxation half-time is measured to be $t_{1/2, \\text{control}} = 75$ ms.
