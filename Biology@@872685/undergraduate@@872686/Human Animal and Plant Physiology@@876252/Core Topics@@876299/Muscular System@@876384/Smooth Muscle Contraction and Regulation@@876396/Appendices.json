Specifically, it has a high affinity for and binds to all four calcium-binding sites on the protein calmodulin, effectively preventing calcium ions from binding to these sites.\n\nAn experiment is conducted where a strip of visceral smooth muscle is placed in an organ bath containing a physiological solution that causes it to maintain a steady, partial contraction.

The muscle will slowly and gradually increase its force of contraction.\nD. The muscle will experience a brief, strong contraction followed by relaxation.\nE. The muscle will enter a state of sustained maximal contraction, similar to rigor.", "solution": "Physiologic mechanism of smooth muscle contraction:\n- Activation requires binding of intracellular $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ to calmodulin (CaM), which forms a complex that activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Activated MLCK phosphorylates the regulatory light chains of myosin, enabling cross-bridge cycling and force generation. Relaxation occurs when $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ decreases and MLCK is inactivated, allowing myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) to dephosphorylate myosin, reducing cross-bridge cycling. The latch-bridge state can maintain tension at low ATP consumption after dephosphorylation, producing a characteristically slow relaxation compared to skeletal muscle.\n\nFormalizing the key binding and activation steps:\n- Calcium-calmodulin binding (net stoichiometric form):\n$$\n4\\,\\text{Ca}^{2+} + \\text{CaM} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{CaM}\\cdot(\\text{Ca}^{2+})_{4}.\n$$\n- MLCK activation is proportional to the concentration of the $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin complex:\n$$\na_{\\text{MLCK}} = \\alpha\\,\\big[\\text{CaM}\\cdot(\\text{Ca}^{2+})_{4}\\big],\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a proportionality constant reflecting MLCK activation per complex.\n\nEffect of the drug:\n- The drug is a potent competitive antagonist for $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ at all four CaM sites and is added at a concentration that saturates all calmodulin molecules. Denote the drug as $D$ with binding\n$$\nD + \\text{CaM} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{CaM}\\cdot D_{4},\n$$\nwhere the drug occupies the four $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$-binding sites. Under saturating $D$, the free calmodulin available for $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ is effectively zero, so\n$$\n\\big[\\text{CaM}\\cdot(\\text{Ca}^{2+})_{4}\\big] \\approx 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a_{\\text{MLCK}} \\approx 0.\n$$\n\nConsequences for myosin phosphorylation and force:\n- Let $p(t)$ be the fraction of myosin regulatory light chains phosphorylated. The balance between phosphorylation by MLCK and dephosphorylation by MLCP can be written as\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = k_{p}\\,a_{\\text{MLCK}}\\,(1 - p) - k_{d}\\,a_{\\text{MLCP}}\\,p,\n$$\nwhere $k_{p}$ and $k_{d}$ are positive rate constants and $a_{\\text{MLCP}}$ is the (nonzero) activity of MLCP under the bath conditions. Immediately after drug addition, $a_{\\text{MLCK}} \\approx 0$, so\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = - k_{d}\\,a_{\\text{MLCP}}\\,p.\n$$\nSolving this first-order linear differential equation with initial condition $p(0)=p_{0}$ (the steady phosphorylated fraction before drug) gives\n$$\np(t) = p_{0}\\,\\exp\\!\\big(-k_{d}\\,a_{\\text{MLCP}}\\,t\\big),\n$$\nwhich is a monotonic decay from the predrug level.\n\nSince active force $T(t)$ in tonic smooth muscle is an increasing function of the phosphorylated fraction and cross-bridge cycling, we can write\n$$\nT(t) = f\\big(p(t)\\big),\n$$\nwith $\\frac{dT}{dp} > 0$ over the relevant range. Therefore,\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{dT}{dp}\\,\\frac{dp}{dt} < 0 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad t>0,\n$$\nso tension begins to decline immediately after drug addition. There is no mechanism for a transient increase in force because the pathway that would increase phosphorylation (via $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$-CaM) is blocked. A state analogous to rigor requires ATP depletion, which is not induced by calmodulin blockade. Although smooth muscle relaxation is typically slower than skeletal muscle due to latch bridges, the most immediate and primary effect is a fall in MLCK activity to approximately zero, initiating relaxation.\n\nTherefore, among the options, the immediate and primary effect is relaxation of the muscle. Given the choices, the best description is a rapid and significant relaxation.\n\nEliminations:\n- B: Incorrect, because $a_{\\text{MLCK}}$ drops to approximately zero, so $p(t)$ and $T(t)$ must decline.\n- C: Incorrect; there is no mechanism to increase force when $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$-CaM is blocked.\n- D: Incorrect; no brief contraction is expected since $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ activation is antagonized.\n- E: Incorrect; rigor-like sustained contraction requires ATP depletion, not calmodulin blockade.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1742955"}, {"introduction": "With the activation switch understood, we now turn to the molecular engine it controls: the cross-bridge cycle. This scenario probes the distinct roles of ATP, revealing that energy is required not only for activating contraction but, critically, for enabling the myosin head to detach from actin for relaxation. This problem clarifies a common point of confusion and explains the molecular basis for rigor-like states in muscle.[@problem_id:1742940]", "problem": "In the regulation of smooth muscle contraction, an increase in intracellular calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) triggers a cascade of events. $Ca^{2+}$ binds to the protein calmodulin, and this complex activates an enzyme called Myosin Light Chain Kinase (MLCK). MLCK then phosphorylates the regulatory light chains on the myosin heads, a process that consumes one molecule of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) per phosphorylation. This phosphorylation is a crucial activation step, enabling the myosin heads to bind to actin filaments and initiate cross-bridge cycling.\n\nThe cross-bridge cycle itself involves several key steps:\n1.  **Attachment:** The phosphorylated myosin head binds to an actin filament.\n2.  **Power Stroke:** The myosin head pivots, pulling the actin filament and releasing previously bound ADP and inorganic phosphate ($P_i$). This movement generates force.\n3.  **Detachment:** A new molecule of ATP must bind to the myosin head to cause it to detach from the actin filament.\n4.  **Re-energizing:** The myosin head hydrolyzes the bound ATP into ADP and $P_i$, which \"re-cocks\" the head into a high-energy position, ready for another cycle.\n\nRelaxation occurs when intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ levels fall, inactivating MLCK, and another enzyme, Myosin Light Chain Phosphatase (MLCP), removes the phosphate group from the myosin light chains.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario in a smooth muscle cell where, at the exact moment the myosin light chains have been successfully phosphorylated by MLCK, the cell's entire supply of ATP is instantaneously and completely depleted. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the resulting state of the muscle cell?\n\nA. The muscle will immediately and fully relax, as the energy-requiring steps of the cross-bridge cycle cannot proceed.\nB. The muscle will contract and remain in a state of sustained contraction.\nC. The muscle will fail to contract because the power stroke, which generates force, is an ATP-dependent process.\nD. The muscle will remain relaxed because the myosin heads, although phosphorylated, require an initial ATP hydrolysis event to bind to actin.\nE. The muscle will undergo one cycle of contraction and then relax, as Myosin Light Chain Phosphatase (MLCP) will dephosphorylate the myosin heads, preventing further interaction.", "solution": "We identify the precise biochemical state and ATP dependencies at each step of smooth muscle contraction and relaxation.\n\n1) Initial condition: Myosin regulatory light chains have just been phosphorylated by MLCK. This phosphorylation step has already consumed ATP, so phosphorylation is accomplished at the instant ATP becomes zero. Phosphorylation permits myosin heads to interact with actin.\n\n2) ATP-dependent steps in the cross-bridge cycle:\n- Detachment requires ATP binding: actin-myosin dissociation strictly depends on ATP binding to myosin.\n- Re-cocking requires ATP hydrolysis: $ \\text{ATP} \\to \\text{ADP} + P_{i} $ primes the myosin head into a high-energy state.\n- The power stroke itself is driven by the release of $P_{i}$ and ADP from the pre-hydrolyzed myosin and does not require a new ATP binding event at that instant.\n\n3) Immediate consequences of ATP depletion:\n- Because myosin is phosphorylated, myosin heads can bind actin. Any myosin heads already in the ADP–$P_{i}$ state (generated before ATP depletion) can attach and undergo a power stroke upon $P_{i}$ and ADP release, generating force.\n- After the power stroke, detachment requires new ATP binding. With ATP now zero, myosin cannot detach from actin, leading to a rigor-like, sustained attachment.\n\n4) Role of MLCP in ATP depletion:\n- MLCP dephosphorylates myosin without requiring ATP (it is a phosphatase using water). Dephosphorylation halts further cycling but does not provide the ATP-dependent detachment step. Thus, attached cross-bridges remain attached (latch/rigor), maintaining force.\n\nConclusion: The muscle will develop force (attachment and power stroke can occur from pre-hydrolyzed heads) and then remain in a sustained contraction because ATP is required for detachment but is absent.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that the muscle will contract and remain in a state of sustained contraction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1742940"}, {"introduction": "In a living organism, smooth muscle is not a simple on-off system but a highly regulated machine. This final practice advances from qualitative prediction to quantitative analysis, reflecting how physiologists dissect complex biological systems.

The contraction is known to be initiated by an increase in intracellular calcium concentration ($[Ca^{2+}]_i$), which activates Calcium-Calmodulin dependent Myosin Light Chain Kinase (MLCK). However, the sustained force is also potentiated by a \"calcium sensitization\" mechanism, primarily driven by the Rho-kinase (ROCK) pathway, which inhibits myosin phosphatase activity.\n\nTo quantify the contribution of this sensitization, an isolated arterial segment is mounted on an isometric myograph to measure force. The relationship between steady-state force $F$, intracellular calcium concentration $C$, and a dimensionless sensitization factor $S$ is described by the following phenomenological model:\n\n$$F(C, S) = S \\times F_{max} \\frac{C^n}{K_D^n + C^n}$$\n\nHere, $F_{max}$ is the maximum potential force the tissue can generate, $K_D$ is the calcium concentration required for half-maximal activation in the absence of sensitization, and $n$ is the Hill coefficient.

First, a vasoconstrictor agonist is applied, inducing a stable tonic contraction. The measured force is $F_1 = 15.0$ mN and the corresponding intracellular calcium concentration is $C_1 = 400$ nM. In this state, the sensitization factor is $S_{agonist}$ due to full activation of the ROCK pathway by the agonist.\n2.  Next, while the agonist is still present, a specific ROCK inhibitor is added. This completely blocks the calcium sensitization effect, returning the sensitization factor $S$ to its basal value of 1.
