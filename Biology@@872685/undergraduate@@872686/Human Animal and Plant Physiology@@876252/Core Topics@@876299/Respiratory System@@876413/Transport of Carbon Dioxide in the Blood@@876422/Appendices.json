It presents a standard physiological calculation based on established principles of physical chemistry. All necessary data are provided, and the constraints are consistent.

This is governed by Henry's Law, which states that at a constant temperature, the concentration of a gas dissolved in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas in equilibrium with the liquid.\n\nThe mathematical formulation of Henry's Law for this context is given by:\n$$ [\\mathrm{CO}_2]_{\\text{dissolved}} = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{CO}_2} \\times P_{a,\\text{CO}_2} $$\nwhere:\n- $[\\mathrm{CO}_2]_{\\text{dissolved}}$ is the molar concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide.\n- $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{CO}_2}$ is the Bunsen solubility coefficient for carbon dioxide in plasma.\n- $P_{a,\\text{CO}_2}$ is the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- $P_{a,\\text{CO}_2} = 40\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{CO}_2} = 0.030\\,\\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$ [\\mathrm{CO}_2]_{\\text{dissolved}} = (0.030\\,\\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1}) \\times (40\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}) $$\n\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$ [\\mathrm{CO}_2]_{\\text{dissolved}} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1} $$\n\nThe problem explicitly requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The provided data, $40\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ and $0.030\\,\\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1}$, have one or two significant figures as written.

Under this necessary assumption, the result is:\n$$ [\\mathrm{CO}_2]_{\\text{dissolved}} = 1.20\\,\\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1} $$\n\nNow, for the interpretation of this result. The total concentration of all forms of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (dissolved $\\text{CO}_2$, bicarbonate ions $\\text{HCO}_3^-$, and carbamino compounds) is approximately $24\\,\\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.

While a small fraction of $CO_2$ is transported dissolved in blood plasma and another fraction binds to hemoglobin to form carbaminohemoglobin, the majority (approximately 70%) is transported in the form of bicarbonate ions ($\\text{HCO}_3^-$). This conversion predominantly occurs within erythrocytes (red blood cells) where the enzyme carbonic anhydrase rapidly catalyzes the reaction: $\\text{CO}_2 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightleftharpoons H_2CO_3 \\rightleftharpoons \\text{H}^+ + \\text{HCO}_3^-$. To allow this reaction to proceed continuously, the bicarbonate product is transported out of the erythrocyte into the plasma in exchange for a chloride ion ($\\text{Cl}^-$), a process known as the \"chloride shift.\" This exchange is mediated by a specific membrane transport protein called the chloride-bicarbonate antiporter (also known as Band 3 protein or Anion Exchanger 1).\n\nConsider a hypothetical genetic disorder where this chloride-bicarbonate antiporter is completely non-functional.

The total $CO_2$ carrying capacity of the blood would be dramatically reduced because the conversion of $CO_2$ to bicarbonate would be severely inhibited.\n\nC. The formation of carbaminohemoglobin would increase to a level that fully compensates for the loss of the bicarbonate transport pathway.\n\nD. A state of chronic metabolic alkalosis would develop due to the trapping of bicarbonate ions within the erythrocytes.\n\nE. The rate of the carbonic anhydrase-catalyzed reaction inside the erythrocytes would significantly accelerate to overcome the transport blockage.", "solution": "We analyze carbon dioxide transport using the established reaction and transport processes in erythrocytes. The key intracellular reaction is\n$$\nCO_{2} + H_{2}O \\rightleftharpoons H_{2}CO_{3} \\rightleftharpoons H^{+} + HCO_{3}^{-},\n$$\ncatalyzed by carbonic anhydrase. At near-equilibrium, with activity approximations treated as concentrations, the mass-action relation can be written as\n$$\nK = \\frac{[H^{+}][HCO_{3}^{-}]}{[CO_{2}]},\n$$\nwhere $K$ is the effective equilibrium constant for the overall hydration and dissociation steps inside the erythrocyte.\n\nIn healthy erythrocytes, the net forward conversion of $CO_{2}$ to $HCO_{3}^{-}$ proceeds continuously because $HCO_{3}^{-}$ is exported to plasma in exchange for $Cl^{-}$ by the chloride-bicarbonate antiporter (Band 3). Let $J_{HCO_{3}^{-}}$ denote the transmembrane flux of bicarbonate (positive outward). Under normal conditions,\n$$\nJ_{HCO_{3}^{-}} > 0,\n$$\nwhich removes product from the intracellular compartment. By Le Chatelier’s principle, continuous removal of $HCO_{3}^{-}$ maintains a rightward drive of the reaction, enabling the majority of transported $CO_{2}$ to be carried as plasma $HCO_{3}^{-}$.\n\nIn the hypothetical disorder, the antiporter is completely non-functional. This imposes\n$$\nJ_{HCO_{3}^{-}} = 0.\n$$\nWith no effective alternative high-capacity $HCO_{3}^{-}$ pathway across the membrane, intracellular $[HCO_{3}^{-}]$ rises until the reaction approaches equilibrium according to\n$$\nK = \\frac{[H^{+}][HCO_{3}^{-}]}{[CO_{2}]},\n$$\nat which point the net forward conversion of $CO_{2}$ to $HCO_{3}^{-}$ ceases. Even though carbonic anhydrase remains catalytically active, catalysis only accelerates approach to equilibrium; it does not change the equilibrium position. Without export of $HCO_{3}^{-}$, there is no sustained sink for product, so there is no sustained net production of $HCO_{3}^{-}$ available in plasma. Consequently, the dominant pathway for $CO_{2}$ transport as plasma bicarbonate collapses.\n\nThe total $CO_{2}$ content carried by blood is the sum of dissolved $CO_{2}$, carbamino compounds, and bicarbonate:\n$$\nC_{\\text{total}} = C_{\\text{diss}} + C_{\\text{carb}} + C_{HCO_{3}^{-}}.\n$$\nHere $C_{HCO_{3}^{-}}$ normally constitutes the largest term. With $J_{HCO_{3}^{-}}=0$, $C_{HCO_{3}^{-}}$ delivered to plasma falls dramatically. The remaining modes cannot fully compensate:\n- Dissolved $CO_{2}$ is $C_{\\text{diss}} = \\alpha P_{CO_{2}}$, which is limited by solubility and physiological constraints on $P_{CO_{2}}$; it does not become the primary capacity-dominant mode without causing severe derangements.\n- Carbamino formation depends on hemoglobin and $P_{CO_{2}}$, and while it may increase modestly, it cannot match the high-capacity bicarbonate pathway.\n\nTherefore, the primary consequence is a dramatic reduction in the blood’s $CO_{2}$ carrying capacity due to the effective inhibition of net $CO_{2} \\to HCO_{3}^{-}$ conversion for export.\n\nWe can further exclude alternative options by considering acid-base implications via the Henderson-Hasselbalch relation for plasma:\n$$\npH = pK_{a} + \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{[HCO_{3}^{-}]}{\\alpha P_{CO_{2}}}\\right).\n$$\nBlocking $HCO_{3}^{-}$ export would tend to decrease plasma $[HCO_{3}^{-}]$ and increase $P_{CO_{2}}$, both driving $pH$ downward (acidemia), not alkalosis. Thus, claims of chronic metabolic alkalosis are inconsistent. Carbonic anhydrase cannot compensate by “accelerating,” as it only speeds equilibration, not capacity.
