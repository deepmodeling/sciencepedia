The results from spirometry and body plethysmography are being analyzed. The patient's Total Lung Capacity (TLC), defined as the volume of air in the lungs at maximal inflation, is measured to be 6.15 Liters. The Vital Capacity (VC), which is the maximum amount of air a person can expel from the lungs after a maximal inhalation, is determined to be 4.95 Liters.

An individual's breathing can be characterized by their respiratory rate ($f$, in breaths per minute) and their tidal volume ($V_T$, the volume of air in a single breath). The total pulmonary ventilation ($\\dot{V}_E$) is the product of these two, $\\dot{V}_E = f \\times V_T$. However, a portion of each breath, known as the anatomical dead space ($V_D$), remains in the conducting airways and does not reach the alveoli for gas exchange. The effective ventilation, or alveolar ventilation ($\\dot{V}_A$), is thus given by $\\dot{V}_A = f \\times (V_T - V_D)$.\n\nFor this problem, we define the alveolar ventilation efficiency ($\\eta$) as the ratio of alveolar ventilation to total pulmonary ventilation: $\\eta = \\dot{V}_A / \\dot{V}_E$.\n\nConsider an individual practicing controlled breathing.
