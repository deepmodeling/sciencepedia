By comparing a normal plant cell to one overexpressing aquaporins during plasmolysis [@problem_id:2304710], you will explore the fundamental link between aquaporin density and the *speed* of water transport. This exercise is key to understanding that while the water potential gradient determines the direction of flow, aquaporins act as facilitators that control the rate of equilibration.", "problem": "An experiment is conducted to study the function of aquaporins, which are protein channels that facilitate the transport of water across cell membranes. Two populations of plant cells are used. The first population consists of wild-type (WT) cells, which express a baseline level of aquaporin proteins in their plasma membranes. The second population consists of genetically engineered (GE) cells, which have been modified to significantly overexpress the same aquaporin protein, resulting in a much higher density of these water channels in their plasma membranes.\n\nInitially, both WT and GE cells are fully turgid and are in equilibrium with an isotonic solution. They are then simultaneously transferred into a concentrated hypertonic sucrose solution. The process of plasmolysis, defined as the shrinking of the protoplast (the plasma membrane and its contents) and its withdrawal from the rigid cell wall due to water loss, is monitored over time for both cell populations.\n\nAssuming all other cellular properties (initial solute concentration, cell wall structure, etc.) are identical between the two cell types, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the observable outcome of this experiment?\n\nA. Cell Type GE will undergo plasmolysis more rapidly than Cell Type WT, but both will eventually reach the same final state of plasmolysis.\n\nB. Cell Type WT will undergo plasmolysis more rapidly than Cell Type GE because the high protein density in the GE cell membrane hinders water movement.\n\nC. Both cell types will undergo plasmolysis at the same rate, as the rate is determined solely by the magnitude of the water potential gradient, which is the same for both.\n\nD. Cell Type GE will exhibit a greater final extent of plasmolysis than Cell Type WT because the additional channels allow a larger volume of water to exit the cell.\n\nE. Neither cell type will show significant plasmolysis because the rigid cell wall prevents the cell from changing volume.", "solution": "Define the water potential of a compartment as $\\Psi_{w} = \\Psi_{s} + \\Psi_{p}$, where $\\Psi_{s}$ is the solute (osmotic) potential and $\\Psi_{p}$ is the pressure (turgor) potential. For ideal dilute solutions, $\\Psi_{s} = - R T C$, where $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is absolute temperature, and $C$ is molar concentration of osmotically active solutes.\n\nThe volumetric water flux per unit membrane area across the plasma membrane is\n$$\nJ_{w} = L_{p}\\,\\Delta \\Psi_{w} = L_{p}\\,(\\Psi_{w,\\text{in}} - \\Psi_{w,\\text{out}}),\n$$\nwhere $L_{p}$ is the hydraulic conductivity (permeability) of the membrane to water. Aquaporins increase $L_{p}$ without transporting solutes. If the cell has membrane area $A$ and volume $V$, then the rate of change of cell water volume is\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = A\\,J_{w} = A\\,L_{p}\\,(\\Psi_{w,\\text{in}}(V) - \\Psi_{w,\\text{out}}).\n$$\nWhen cells are transferred from isotonic conditions to a hypertonic sucrose solution, $\\Psi_{w,\\text{out}}$ becomes more negative than $\\Psi_{w,\\text{in}}$, so $\\Delta \\Psi_{w} < 0$ initially and water exits the cell, driving plasmolysis (the plasma membrane retracts from the cell wall).\n\nComparison of rates: For two cell types with identical $\\Psi_{w,\\text{in}}(V)$, $\\Psi_{w,\\text{out}}$, $A$, and wall properties, but different water channel densities, the engineered cells have a larger $L_{p}$ due to aquaporin overexpression. The governing equation shows the time dependence scales with $L_{p}$. Specifically, with $L_{p,\\text{GE}} > L_{p,\\text{WT}}$, for the same instantaneous $\\Delta \\Psi_{w}$ one has $|dV/dt|$ larger in GE, so the GE cells lose water (and thus undergo plasmolysis) more rapidly.\n\nFinal state (extent of plasmolysis): The equilibrium is defined by $\\Delta \\Psi_{w} = 0$, i.e.\n$$\n\\Psi_{w,\\text{in}}(V^{\\ast}) = \\Psi_{w,\\text{out}},\n$$\nwhich determines a fixed point $V^{\\ast}$. Because aquaporins do not change solute content, the intracellular solute amount $n_{s}$ is conserved, so $C_{\\text{in}} = n_{s}/V_{\\text{water}}$ increases as $V$ decreases until the osmotic and pressure components satisfy the equality above. This equilibrium volume (and thus the final extent of plasmolysis) depends on $n_{s}$, $R$, $T$, $\\Psi_{w,\\text{out}}$, and wall mechanics, but not on $L_{p}$. Therefore, both WT and GE reach the same final state; only the kinetics differ.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is correct: higher $L_{p}$ in GE causes faster plasmolysis, with the same final equilibrium extent because equilibrium is set by $\\Psi_{w,\\text{in}} = \\Psi_{w,\\text{out}}$, independent of $L_{p}$.\n- B is incorrect: increased aquaporin density facilitates, not hinders, water movement; it increases $L_{p}$.\n- C is incorrect: the rate depends on both $\\Delta \\Psi_{w}$ and $L_{p}$; with identical $\\Delta \\Psi_{w}$ but different $L_{p}$, rates differ.\n- D is incorrect: $L_{p}$ affects kinetics, not the equilibrium extent, which is set by water potential equality.\n- E is incorrect: the rigid wall maintains shape but does not prevent the protoplast from shrinking; plasmolysis is the protoplast retracting from the wall.\n\nThus, the most accurate prediction is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2304710"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative observation to quantitative analysis, this problem asks you to calculate the change in equilibration time for a cell lacking aquaporins.

This practice sharpens your ability to model cellular water relations and predict how genetic modifications impact physiological response times, using concepts like the half-time for equilibration, $T_{1/2}$.", "problem": "A biophysicist is investigating the role of aquaporins in plant cell water transport. The experiment uses protoplasts (plant cells with their cell walls enzymatically removed) harvested from the leaves of wild-type (WT) plants and a genetically modified line where all aquaporin genes have been knocked out (KO). The protoplasts are assumed to be perfect spheres, initially with a diameter of $D_0 = 40.0 \\ \\mu\\text{m}$. A fraction of the protoplast volume, $f = 0.20$, is considered osmotically inactive, meaning it is occupied by macromolecules and structures that do not contribute to the osmotic volume.\n\nInitially, all protoplasts are equilibrated in a solution such that their internal osmotic potential is $\\Psi_{s,\\text{in},0} = -0.90 \\ \\text{MPa}$. At time $t=0$, they are rapidly transferred to a more concentrated external solution with a constant osmotic potential of $\\Psi_{s,\\text{ext}} = -1.50 \\ \\text{MPa}$. This induces an osmotic shock, causing water to leave the protoplasts and their volume to decrease.\n\nThe volume of the protoplasts is monitored over time, and the half-time for water equilibration, $T_{1/2}$, is determined. The half-time is defined as the time it takes for the protoplast's volume to complete half of its total change, i.e., $V(T_{1/2}) = \\frac{V_0 + V_\\infty}{2}$, where $V_0$ is the initial volume and $V_\\infty$ is the final equilibrium volume. For the wild-type protoplasts, the measured half-time is $T_{1/2, \\text{WT}} = 1.20 \\ \\text{s}$. It is known from separate measurements that under these conditions, the aquaporin-mediated pathway is responsible for 80% of the total water flux in wild-type protoplasts.\n\nAssuming that the process of water transport can be modeled as a first-order kinetic process, calculate the expected half-time for equilibration for the knockout (KO) protoplasts.
