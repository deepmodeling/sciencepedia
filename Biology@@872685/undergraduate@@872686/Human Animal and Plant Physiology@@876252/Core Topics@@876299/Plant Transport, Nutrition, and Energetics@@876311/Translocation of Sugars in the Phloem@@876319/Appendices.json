To trace the movement of photosynthates, the scientist selects a single, healthy, mature leaf located halfway up the plant's main stem. This leaf is enclosed in a transparent, sealed bag containing air enriched with radioactive carbon dioxide ($^{14}\\text{CO}_2$). The leaf is illuminated for several hours, allowing it to photosynthesize and incorporate the $^{14}\\text{C}$ into sugars. After this exposure period, the bag is removed, and the plant is left under normal conditions for 24 hours to allow for the transport of these newly synthesized sugars.\n\nBased on the principles of phloem transport and source-sink dynamics in plants, which of the following locations would be expected to show a significant accumulation of the radioactive $^{14}\\text{C}$ label after the 24-hour translocation period?\n\nSelect all valid options.\n\nA. The fine roots of the plant.\n\nB. The actively growing underground tubers.\n\nC. The apical meristem and the surrounding young, unexpanded leaves at the top of the plant.\n\nD. A different, untreated mature leaf located on the opposite side of the stem.\n\nE. The cluster of flowers at the top of the plant.\n\nF. The lignified, water-conducting vessel elements of the xylem in the stem.", "solution": "The labeled mature leaf acts as a source after incorporating $^{14}\\text{C}$ into transport sugars (primarily sucrose), here denoted $S^{\\ast}$. By phloem loading, the concentration of $S^{\\ast}$ in sieve elements at the source increases, raising solute concentration and lowering the solute component of water potential $\\Psi_{s}$.\n\nWater movement and pressure generation in the phloem follow the relation for water potential,\n$$\n\\Psi = \\Psi_{s} + \\Psi_{p},\n$$\nwhere $\\Psi_{p}$ is the pressure (turgor) potential. An increase in $[S^{\\ast}]$ at the source lowers $\\Psi_{s}$, thus lowering $\\Psi$, which drives water entry from adjacent xylem into the phloem, increasing $\\Psi_{p}$ at the source.\n\nAccording to the pressure-flow (Munch) hypothesis, bulk flow of phloem sap proceeds from high pressure at sources to low pressure at sinks. A simple constitutive relation for mass flow is\n$$\nJ = K\\left(P_{\\text{source}} - P_{\\text{sink}}\\right),\n$$\nwith $K$ the hydraulic conductance of the sieve-tube path and $P$ the turgor pressure. At sinks, unloading of $S^{\\ast}$ lowers $[S^{\\ast}]$, increases $\\Psi$, reduces $P_{\\text{sink}}$, and maintains the pressure gradient that drives $S^{\\ast}$ delivery.\n\nSinks are tissues with high demand for carbon due to growth, storage, or metabolism. In a potato simultaneously flowering and tuberizing, the following are strong sinks and thus expected to accumulate $^{14}\\text{C}$ after $24$ hours:\n- Actively growing underground tubers (storage sinks): strong demand for sucrose for starch deposition; expect significant $S^{\\ast}$ accumulation (B).\n- Apical meristem and young, unexpanded leaves (growth sinks): high import for cell division and expansion; expect significant accumulation (C).\n- Flowers at the top (reproductive sinks): developing floral tissues import photosynthate; expect accumulation (E).\n- Fine roots (growth and maintenance sinks): root tips and fine roots import carbon for growth and respiration; expect accumulation (A).\n\nBy contrast:\n- A different, untreated mature leaf is itself a source with net export rather than import; it is not a sink under normal conditions and thus would not show significant $^{14}\\text{C}$ accumulation (D excluded).\n- Lignified vessel elements of the xylem are dead cells and are not part of the phloem transport pathway for sucrose; sucrose is transported in sieve elements, not xylem vessels, so no accumulation is expected in xylem vessel elements (F excluded).\n\nBecause the labeled source leaf is located halfway up the stem, phloem transport can proceed both upward and downward within its vascular sector over the $24$ hour period, delivering $S^{\\ast}$ to both shoot and root/tuber sinks. Therefore, the locations expected to show significant accumulation are A, B, C, and E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCE}$$", "id": "1755050"}, {"introduction": "The movement of sugar through the phloem is driven by a pressure gradient, but how is this gradient established? This practice problem [@problem_id:1727911] confronts a common misconception by asking why simply placing a plant cutting in sugar water doesn't \"feed\" it through the phloem. By working through this scenario, you'll uncover the critical role of active transport in phloem loading, a process that is highly regulated and requires specific cellular machinery.", "problem": "An undergraduate student conducting a plant physiology experiment takes a freshly cut celery stalk (which primarily consists of a petiole and some leaflets) and places its base in a beaker containing a concentrated, sterile sucrose solution. The experimental setup is left for several hours under standard laboratory conditions. Subsequent analysis of the tissues in the upper part of the leaflets reveals that, while water has moved up the xylem, the sucrose from the beaker has not been transported upwards through the phloem tissue. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate physiological explanation for this observation?\n\nA. Phloem loading is a highly regulated active transport process that requires specific cellular machinery and metabolic energy, which are primarily located in specialized source tissues (like mature leaves performing photosynthesis) and are not functional along the cut vascular bundles of the celery stalk.\n\nB. The sucrose solution is too viscous for the plant to transport. The cohesive and adhesive properties of water that drive transport are disrupted by the high solute concentration, preventing any bulk flow in the vascular tissues.\n\nC. The high external concentration of sucrose creates a strong negative water potential outside the phloem, causing water to move out of the sieve tubes and into the beaker, thereby generating a hydrostatic pressure that opposes any upward movement.\n\nD. Upward transport in the phloem is initiated by a pressure gradient established by active water uptake in the roots. Since the celery stalk is cut and lacks roots, this initial pressure pump is missing.\n\nE. The transport of sucrose into the phloem is a passive process driven by diffusion. The existing concentration of sugars within the phloem sap is already higher than that of the solution in the beaker, preventing a favorable diffusion gradient.", "solution": "We analyze the distinct transport mechanisms of xylem and phloem and the anatomical-physiological constraints imposed by cutting the stalk.\n\nStep 1: Explain why water still moves in the xylem of a cut stalk.\nThe ascent of xylem sap is driven by the cohesion-tension mechanism, which relies on transpiration at the leaf surfaces to generate a negative pressure potential in the xylem. This process is passive and can persist in a cut stem because xylem vessels are dead, lignified conduits that can maintain a continuous water column from the beaker to the leaves, provided that the leaves are transpiring. Thus, water can move upward through the xylem even without roots.\n\nStep 2: State what drives phloem translocation under normal conditions.\nAccording to the pressure-flow (Münch) hypothesis, phloem transport requires:\n- Active loading of sucrose at source tissues (typically mature photosynthetic leaves) into sieve elements via companion cells, often through proton-coupled sucrose symporters powered by a plasma membrane $H^{+}$-ATPase.\n- This loading decreases the solute potential in sieve elements, draws water osmotically from the xylem, increases hydrostatic pressure at the source, and drives bulk flow toward sinks along the sieve tube network.\n- Unloading occurs at sinks; transport direction is set by source-sink pressure differences, not by root-generated pressures.\n\nStep 3: Identify why sucrose in the beaker is not transported upward in the phloem of a cut stalk.\n- Specialized phloem-loading machinery (companion cells with $H^{+}$-ATPase and sucrose transporters, often localized to minor veins of source leaves) is not generally functional at a cut petiole base. Therefore, sucrose in the external beaker solution is not effectively taken up into sieve elements to initiate a source-like high-pressure region at the base.\n- Additionally, cutting phloem triggers rapid occlusion (P-protein plugging and callose deposition), which seals sieve plates to prevent sap loss and disrupts continuity, further preventing uptake and mass flow initiation from the cut end.\n- Consequently, although xylem can still conduct water upward, phloem does not load sucrose from the beaker nor establish the necessary pressure gradient for upward translocation.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options.\n- A: Correct. It accurately states that phloem loading is a regulated, energy-dependent process localized to specialized source tissues and not operative along cut vascular bundles; thus exogenous sucrose at the cut base is not loaded into phloem.\n- B: Incorrect. While viscosity affects flow, phloem sap is normally sucrose-rich and still flows; moreover, the limiting factor here is loading/continuity, not viscosity of an external solution.\n- C: Incorrect. The beaker’s external solution does not set phloem driving pressures in intact sieve tubes; any local water potential effect at the cut base would not generate a sustained opposing hydrostatic pressure that explains the absence of upward sucrose translocation.\n- D: Incorrect. Phloem pressure gradients arise from source loading, not from active water uptake in roots; root pressure is relevant to xylem, not the primary driver of phloem flow.\n- E: Incorrect. Phloem loading is not generally passive diffusion; in many species it is active apoplastic loading. The premise about diffusion gradients is also flawed in this context.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate physiological explanation is given by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1727911"}, {"introduction": "The integrity of the entire sugar translocation pathway depends on the stability of sucrose as the transport molecule. This problem [@problem_id:1755051] presents a genetic engineering thought experiment where sucrose is broken down in source leaves before it can be loaded into the phloem. Analyzing this scenario will challenge you to predict the cascading effects on the entire plant, demonstrating the critical link between molecular events at the source and the growth and survival of distant sink tissues.", "problem": "In a typical vascular plant, sucrose produced during photosynthesis in source tissues (e.g., mature leaves) is actively loaded into the phloem. This process drives the long-distance transport of sugars to sink tissues (e.g., roots, fruits, developing leaves) where they are unloaded and utilized for growth or storage. A key aspect of this transport system is that sucrose is the primary mobile sugar, and its concentration gradient dictates the direction and rate of flow.\n\nConsider a hypothetical genetic engineering experiment where a plant is modified to constitutively overexpress a vacuolar invertase specifically within its source leaf mesophyll cells. Invertase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of one molecule of sucrose into one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose. These monosaccharides are generally not substrates for the transporters responsible for loading sugars into the phloem.\n\nBased on your understanding of sugar translocation, which of the following phenotypes is the most direct and significant consequence of this genetic modification?\n\nA. A dramatic increase in the size of fruits and storage roots due to an oversupply of readily metabolizable sugars.\n\nB. An accumulation of starch in the source leaves and a significant increase in the rate of phloem translocation.\n\nC. A reduction in the water potential of phloem sap in the source leaves, leading to enhanced phloem loading efficiency.\n\nD. Severe stunting of plant growth, especially in sink tissues like roots and new shoots, coupled with potential carbohydrate accumulation in source leaves.\n\nE. An accelerated rate of photosynthesis in the source leaves due to the rapid removal of its sucrose product.", "solution": "Phloem translocation in vascular plants is driven by the pressure-flow mechanism: sucrose synthesized in source mesophyll is actively loaded into sieve element–companion cell complexes in source regions, lowering the osmotic potential of the phloem sap there and thus lowering the water potential. Water follows osmotically, raising turgor pressure in source phloem. A pressure gradient between source and sink drives bulk flow. In symbols, the water potential satisfies $\\psi=\\psi_{p}+\\psi_{s}$, and active loading makes $\\psi_{s}$ more negative in source phloem, thereby increasing $\\psi_{p}$ via water influx. The volumetric flow rate can be represented as $J_{v}\\propto \\Delta P/R$, where $\\Delta P$ is the difference in turgor pressure between source and sink and $R$ is the hydraulic resistance.\n\nIn the engineered plant, vacuolar invertase is constitutively overexpressed in source mesophyll cells. Invertase hydrolyzes one sucrose molecule into one glucose and one fructose. Because the enzyme is vacuolar in mesophyll cells, it diverts sucrose from the cytosolic pool into the vacuole where it is hydrolyzed. The monosaccharides produced are generally not substrates for the primary phloem loading transporters (sucrose–proton symporters) at the companion cell/sieve element interface. Consequently, cytosolic sucrose availability in source tissues for phloem loading decreases.\n\nWith reduced sucrose loading into the phloem, the solute concentration in source phloem sap declines, making $\\psi_{s}$ less negative, which raises $\\psi$ and reduces the osmotic driving force for water entry into the sieve elements at the source. This lowers source turgor pressure and thus reduces the pressure gradient $\\Delta P$ between source and sink. Therefore, the mass flow rate $J_{v}$ decreases.\n\nAt the whole-plant level, sinks receive less carbohydrate, causing sink limitation: reduced growth of roots, developing leaves, and reproductive structures. Meanwhile, sugars accumulate in source leaves because export is impaired; hexoses accumulate in the vacuole, and excess carbon is diverted to starch in chloroplasts. Sugar accumulation also triggers feedback inhibition of photosynthesis rather than stimulation. These outcomes exclude options suggesting enhanced translocation or growth.\n\nSpecifically:\n- Option A is incorrect because sinks are deprived of sucrose, so fruit and storage roots do not enlarge; instead they are starved.\n- Option B is incorrect because although carbohydrate can accumulate in source leaves (including starch), the rate of phloem translocation decreases, not increases.\n- Option C is incorrect because the water potential of source phloem sap would become less negative (not more negative) due to reduced sucrose loading, decreasing, not enhancing, loading efficiency.\n- Option E is incorrect because photosynthesis is typically downregulated by sugar accumulation; export is not effectively increased since monosaccharides are not efficiently loaded into phloem.\n\nThe most direct and significant phenotype is sink growth inhibition coupled with carbohydrate accumulation in source leaves, matching option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1755051"}]}
