This mutant strain has a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the SUT1 sucrose-proton symporter. In wild-type plants, SUT1 is highly expressed and localized to the plasma membrane of companion cells within the minor veins of source leaves. This symporter is essential for actively loading sucrose from the apoplast (the space outside the cell membrane) into the phloem. The mutant plant is grown alongside a wild-type control plant under identical, optimal conditions for photosynthesis and growth (i.e., adequate light, water, and soil nutrients).\n\nBased on the pressure-flow hypothesis of phloem transport, which of the following sets of physiological consequences would be most expected in the SUT1 mutant plant compared to the wild-type control?\n\nA. Increased turgor pressure in leaf mesophyll cells, decreased turgor pressure in the phloem sieve tube elements of the leaves, and severely inhibited root growth.\n\nB.

The water potential of a cell is given by $\\Psi_{w} = \\Psi_{s} + \\Psi_{p}$ (neglecting gravity and matric terms for these tissues), where $\\Psi_{s}$ is the solute potential (more negative with more solute) and $\\Psi_{p}$ is the turgor pressure. In source leaves of wild type, SUT1 actively loads sucrose from the apoplast into companion cells/sieve elements, making $\\Psi_{s}$ in the sieve tubes more negative, which draws in water osmotically from the xylem, thereby increasing $\\Psi_{p}$ in sieve tube elements. This elevated $\\Psi_{p}$ at the source drives mass flow toward sinks.\n\nIn the SUT1 loss-of-function mutant:\n1) Phloem loading in source leaves is impaired. Therefore, in sieve tube elements of source leaves, sucrose concentration is reduced relative to wild type, so $\\Psi_{s}$ is less negative, water influx is reduced, and $\\Psi_{p}$ (turgor pressure) in sieve tube elements decreases relative to wild type.\n2) Because sucrose export from mesophyll to the phloem is impaired, sugars accumulate in source leaf cells (mesophyll and associated tissues). This accumulation makes $\\Psi_{s}$ in mesophyll cells more negative, causing greater water influx and thus an increase in $\\Psi_{p}$ (turgor pressure) of mesophyll cells relative to wild type.\n3) Reduced phloem export from source leaves lowers carbohydrate delivery to sinks such as roots, leading to severely inhibited root growth.\n\nThese outcomes correspond to increased turgor pressure in leaf mesophyll cells, decreased turgor pressure in the phloem sieve tube elements of the leaves, and severely inhibited root growth, which matches option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1752303"}, {"introduction": "Once a high pressure is established at the source, the sugar-rich sap must flow through a complex network of sieve tubes. This pathway is not an empty pipe; its structure creates resistance to flow. This exercise uses the principles of fluid dynamics to model how the specific anatomy of sieve plates—perforated structures connecting phloem cells—impacts overall transport efficiency, revealing the powerful relationship between cellular structure and physiological function [@problem_id:1752278].", "problem": "In plant biology, the pressure-flow hypothesis describes the mechanism of phloem transport, where sugars produced during photosynthesis are moved from a source (e.g., a leaf) to a sink (e.g., a root). This transport occurs through a series of connected cells called sieve tube elements, which are joined end-to-end. The junction between two sieve tube elements is a perforated wall called a sieve plate.\n\nConsider a simplified model of a functional phloem unit consisting of a single cylindrical sieve tube element of length $L$ and radius $R$, connected in series to a single sieve plate. The sieve plate has a thickness $l$ and contains $N$ identical circular pores through which the sugar-rich sap flows. In a healthy, wild-type plant, each of these pores has a radius $r_{0}$. The sap can be modeled as a viscous fluid with viscosity $\\eta$. The entire unit is subject to a total pressure drop of $\\Delta P$ from one end to the other, which drives the flow.\n\nNow, consider a plant with a genetic mutation that leads to the excessive synthesis of callose, a polysaccharide that is deposited around the sieve plate pores. This deposition partially clogs the pores, reducing their effective radius to a new value, $r_{m}$, where $r_{m} < r_{0}$. Assume the dimensions of the sieve tube element ($L$, $R$) and the sieve plate ($l$, $N$) remain unchanged, and the pressure drop $\\Delta P$ driving the flow is the same for both the wild-type and the mutant plant.\n\nAssuming the flow of sap is laminar, calculate the ratio of the transport efficiency of the mutant plant to that of the wild-type plant.

We can model this system as a bundle of $N$ identical, parallel, cylindrical capillaries, each with a radius $r$ and length $L$.
