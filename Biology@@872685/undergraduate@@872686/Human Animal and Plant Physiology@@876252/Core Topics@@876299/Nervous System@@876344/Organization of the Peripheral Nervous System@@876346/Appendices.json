Upon examination, the following observations are made about the patient's left eye:\n1. The upper eyelid is significantly drooped, a condition known as ptosis.\n2. The pupil is fixed and dilated and does not constrict when a bright light is shone into it.\n3. When asked to follow the examiner's finger, the patient cannot move the eye inward (medially), upward, or downward.\n4. However, the patient is still able to move the eye outward (laterally) and diagonally downward-and-outward. Sensation on the cornea and the skin of the face is normal.\n\nBased on this specific combination of preserved and lost functions, which one of the following cranial nerves is most likely compromised?\n\nA. Trochlear Nerve (CN IV)\n\nB. Oculomotor Nerve (CN III)\n\nC. Abducens Nerve (CN VI)\n\nD. Trigeminal Nerve (CN V)\n\nE. Optic Nerve (CN II)", "solution": "We begin by mapping the observed deficits and preserved functions to the cranial nerves and extraocular muscles they control, using standard neuroanatomy.\n\nPtosis of the upper eyelid indicates dysfunction of the levator palpebrae superioris, which is innervated by the somatic motor component of the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III). While mild ptosis can also occur with sympathetic loss to the superior tarsal muscle, the presence of a fixed, dilated pupil indicates parasympathetic dysfunction rather than sympathetic loss.\n\nA fixed, dilated pupil that does not constrict to light indicates loss of the efferent limb of the pupillary light reflex. The afferent limb is carried by the optic nerve (cranial nerve II), which detects light; the efferent limb travels in the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus to the ciliary ganglion and then via short ciliary nerves to the sphincter pupillae. Therefore, loss of constriction with a dilated pupil is characteristic of a lesion affecting the parasympathetic fibers of cranial nerve III. An optic nerve lesion would impair vision and the afferent limb but would not produce ophthalmoplegia as described.\n\nThe inability to move the left eye inward (medial rectus), upward (superior rectus and inferior oblique), or downward (inferior rectus) indicates loss of somatic motor fibers of cranial nerve III, which innervates the medial rectus, superior rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique muscles. By contrast, the preservation of outward (lateral) movement indicates the lateral rectus is intact, which is innervated by the abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI), arguing against a cranial nerve VI lesion. The preserved diagonally downward-and-outward movement indicates the superior oblique is intact, which is innervated by the trochlear nerve (cranial nerve IV), arguing against a cranial nerve IV lesion.\n\nNormal corneal sensation and normal facial skin sensation indicate that the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), particularly the ophthalmic division that carries the afferent limb of the corneal reflex, is intact.\n\nCollectively, the triad of ptosis (levator palpebrae superioris), a fixed dilated pupil with absent light reflex (parasympathetic to sphincter pupillae), and ophthalmoplegia sparing only lateral gaze and down-and-out movement (loss of medial rectus, superior rectus, inferior rectus, inferior oblique, with intact lateral rectus and superior oblique) localizes to a lesion of the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III). Therefore, the most likely compromised nerve is the oculomotor nerve, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1724407"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple \"on/off\" signals, the autonomic nervous system employs sophisticated strategies to maintain homeostasis. One of the most important is the concept of tonic control, where a baseline level of activity is continuously modulated to achieve a range of effects. This practice problem [@problem_id:1724421] explores how this principle allows the sympathetic division, acting alone, to both constrict and dilate blood vessels, a crucial mechanism for regulating blood pressure and flow.", "problem": "In the human body, the regulation of blood flow and pressure is critically managed by adjusting the diameter of arterioles, which are small arteries. This adjustment is a key function of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS), a division of the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS). For the vast majority of arterioles in the systemic circulation (e.g., those supplying the skin and digestive organs), innervation is provided exclusively by the sympathetic division of the ANS; there is no parasympathetic input. Nevertheless, the sympathetic nervous system is capable of causing both vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessel) and vasodilation (widening of the blood vessel).\n\nWhich of the following statements best explains the fundamental physiological mechanism that allows this single-input system to produce two opposite effects (constriction and dilation)?\n\nA. Sympathetic neurons can release two different types of neurotransmitters, one causing constriction and the other causing dilation, depending on the signal from the central nervous system.\n\nB. The smooth muscle cells of the arteriolar walls possess different subtypes of adrenergic receptors (e.g., alpha and beta) that produce opposing effects when bound by the same neurotransmitter.\n\nC. The parasympathetic nervous system can release hormones into the bloodstream that override the local sympathetic signals at the arterioles.\n\nD. Sympathetic neurons maintain a constant, baseline level of firing, and modulation of this firing rate above or below the baseline determines the degree of vessel constriction or dilation.\n\nE. The somatic nervous system can directly intervene and inhibit the sympathetic neurons innervating the arterioles, leading to vasodilation.", "solution": "We are asked how a single-input system (sympathetic only) can produce both vasoconstriction and vasodilation in most systemic arterioles.\n\nStep 1: Identify the baseline control principle. Sympathetic vasomotor neurons fire at a resting rate (sympathetic tone). This baseline firing maintains a partial constriction of arteriolar smooth muscle. This is a fundamental physiological property of the autonomic regulation of vascular smooth muscle.\n\nStep 2: Determine the effect of increasing sympathetic firing above baseline. An increase in firing rate elevates norepinephrine release onto predominantly alpha-adrenergic receptors (especially $\\alpha_1$, coupled to $G_q$), increasing intracellular signaling that raises smooth muscle tone, thus producing greater vasoconstriction.\n\nStep 3: Determine the effect of decreasing sympathetic firing below baseline. A decrease in firing rate reduces norepinephrine release, lowering alpha receptor activation, which relaxes vascular smooth muscle relative to the baseline tone, thereby producing vasodilation. This dilation does not require a separate parasympathetic input; it results from withdrawal of sympathetic tone.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate alternatives to ensure the best explanation is chosen.\n- Option A is incorrect because, in arteriolar sympathetic innervation, the principal neurotransmitter is norepinephrine; the mechanism for bidirectional control is not switching transmitters. While some sympathetic fibers release acetylcholine (e.g., to sweat glands), that is not the general mechanism for arteriolar caliber control in the systemic circulation described.\n- Option B is partially true in select vascular beds (e.g., $\\beta_2$-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle with circulating epinephrine), but the question emphasizes the vast majority of arterioles (e.g., skin and gut) that are primarily alpha-adrenergic; their dilation is mainly achieved by reducing sympathetic tone rather than invoking opposing receptor subtypes. Thus this is not the fundamental mechanism for most arterioles.\n- Option C is incorrect; parasympathetic hormonal override is not the primary regulator of arteriolar tone in the systemic circulation described.\n- Option E is incorrect; the somatic nervous system does not directly control smooth muscle of arterioles.\n\nStep 5: Conclude the fundamental mechanism. The single sympathetic input can produce both constriction and dilation through modulation of a constant baseline firing rate: increases cause vasoconstriction; decreases cause vasodilation. Therefore, the best explanation is the existence and modulation of sympathetic tone.\n\nThus, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1724421"}, {"introduction": "Just as with cranial nerves, a precise understanding of the anatomy of peripheral nerves in the limbs is essential for diagnosing injuries. Nerves exiting the spinal cord branch out to innervate specific groups of muscles and areas of skin in a highly organized pattern. This final exercise [@problem_id:1724403] asks you to work backward from a set of motor and sensory losses in the lower leg to identify the exact location of a nerve injury, reinforcing the importance of anatomical mapping in clinical problem-solving.", "problem": "A 25-year-old patient is examined in a clinic following a traumatic injury to the right knee, sustained during a sports accident where their knee was forced backwards. The physical examination reveals a specific pattern of motor loss in the right lower leg and foot. The patient is unable to lift the front of their foot off the ground (a motion known as dorsiflexion) and cannot turn the sole of their foot outwards (eversion). However, they retain the ability to point their foot downwards (plantarflexion) and turn the sole of their foot inwards (inversion). Sensation is also noted to be diminished on the top (dorsum) of the foot and the lateral aspect of the leg. Based on this precise combination of lost and preserved functions, which of the following nervous structures is the most likely site of the lesion?\n\nA. Deep fibular nerve\n\nB. Superficial fibular nerve\n\nC. Common fibular nerve\n\nD. Tibial nerve\n\nE. Sciatic nerve, proximal to its bifurcation in the popliteal fossa", "solution": "The pattern of motor and sensory loss is analyzed by mapping functions to compartment innervation and cutaneous territories.\n\n1) Lost dorsiflexion of the foot indicates loss of the anterior compartment of the leg, whose main muscles (tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus) are innervated by the deep fibular (peroneal) nerve.\n\n2) Lost eversion of the foot indicates loss of the lateral compartment, whose muscles (fibularis longus and brevis) are innervated by the superficial fibular nerve.\n\n3) Preserved plantarflexion indicates the posterior compartment (gastrocnemius, soleus, plantaris, etc.) innervated by the tibial nerve is intact.\n\n4) Preserved inversion indicates that tibialis posterior (tibial nerve) is functioning. Inversion is produced by tibialis anterior (deep fibular) and tibialis posterior (tibial). With deep fibular function lost, preserved inversion must be due to intact tibialis posterior via the tibial nerve.\n\n5) Sensory loss on the dorsum of the foot and lateral leg corresponds to cutaneous distribution of the superficial fibular nerve on the dorsum of the foot and branches of the common fibular nerve (e.g., lateral sural cutaneous) along the lateral leg. Deep fibular contributes sensation to the first web space on the dorsum. The described territory supports involvement proximal to the bifurcation of superficial and deep branches.\n\n6) Integrating motor and sensory findings: both deep and superficial fibular nerve functions are impaired, while tibial nerve functions are spared. This localizes the lesion to the common fibular nerve proximal to its bifurcation.\n\n7) Excluding other options:\n- Deep fibular nerve lesion alone would cause dorsiflexion loss but spare eversion; sensory loss would be limited to the first dorsal web space.\n- Superficial fibular nerve lesion alone would cause eversion loss but spare dorsiflexion; sensory loss would involve most of the dorsum of the foot but not the first web space; foot drop would be absent.\n- Tibial nerve lesion would impair plantarflexion and inversion and affect plantar foot sensation, which are preserved here.\n- Sciatic nerve lesion proximal to bifurcation would include tibial deficits (loss of plantarflexion and inversion), which are not present.\n\nTherefore, the most likely site of lesion is the common fibular nerve.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1724403"}]}
