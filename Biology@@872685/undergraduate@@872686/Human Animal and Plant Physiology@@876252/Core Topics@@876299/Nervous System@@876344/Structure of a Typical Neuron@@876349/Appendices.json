The unique shape of many spines, with a bulbous head and a thin neck, is critical for modulating synaptic strength. In this practice, we will use a simplified electrical model to investigate how the physical structure of a spine, particularly the resistance of its neck, influences how much of a synaptic signal reaches the parent dendrite. By deriving the voltage attenuation factor, you will gain insight into how spine morphology can act as a filter for synaptic inputs [@problem_id:1745314].", "problem": "In neuroscience, the morphology of a dendritic spine is thought to play a crucial role in synaptic plasticity. A typical spine consists of a bulbous head, where excitatory synapses are formed, and a thin neck that connects the head to the parent dendrite. The electrical properties of the neck can influence how a local synaptic signal propagates to the rest of the neuron.\n\nConsider a simplified steady-state electrical model of this system. The spine head is modeled as a compartment with a membrane resistance $R_{head}$ to the extracellular space (ground). The parent dendrite, at the point where the spine attaches, is modeled as a compartment with an input resistance $R_{dendrite}$ to ground. The cytoplasm within the spine neck is modeled as a single axial resistor with resistance $R_{neck}$ that connects the spine head compartment to the dendrite compartment.\n\nAn ongoing synaptic activation on the spine head generates an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP). In this steady-state model, this activation establishes a constant voltage difference $V_H$ in the spine head and a corresponding constant voltage $V_D$ at the base of the spine on the parent dendrite, both measured relative to the extracellular ground.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the dimensionless voltage attenuation factor, $\\alpha = \\frac{V_D}{V_H}$, in terms of the given resistances $R_{head}$, $R_{neck}$, and $R_{dendrite}$.", "solution": "We model the system as a two-node resistive network at steady state. Let the spine head node have voltage $V_{H}$ relative to ground, connected to ground via $R_{head}$ and to the dendrite node via $R_{neck}$. The dendrite node has voltage $V_{D}$ relative to ground and is connected to ground via $R_{dendrite}$. There is no external current source at the dendrite node, so Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) at the dendrite node requires that the current flowing through the neck into the dendrite equals the leak current from the dendrite to ground:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{H}-V_{D}}{R_{neck}}=\\frac{V_{D}}{R_{dendrite}}.\n$$\nSolving algebraically for the ratio $\\alpha=\\frac{V_{D}}{V_{H}}$, proceed step by step:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{H}-V_{D}}{R_{neck}}=\\frac{V_{D}}{R_{dendrite}}\n\\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\;\nR_{dendrite}\\left(V_{H}-V_{D}\\right)=R_{neck}V_{D}\n$$\n$$\nR_{dendrite}V_{H}-R_{dendrite}V_{D}=R_{neck}V_{D}\n\\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\;\nR_{dendrite}V_{H}=V_{D}\\left(R_{neck}+R_{dendrite}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{V_{D}}{V_{H}}=\\frac{R_{dendrite}}{R_{neck}+R_{dendrite}}.\n$$\nThus the attenuation factor is\n$$\n\\alpha=\\frac{V_{D}}{V_{H}}=\\frac{R_{dendrite}}{R_{neck}+R_{dendrite}}.\n$$\nNote that $R_{head}$ does not enter this ratio because the dendrite node’s KCL, which fixes the relation between $V_{D}$ and $V_{H}$, depends only on the pathway through $R_{neck}$ and the leak through $R_{dendrite}$. The value of $R_{head}$ influences $V_{H}$ for a given synaptic drive but cancels out in the ratio $\\alpha$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{R_{dendrite}}{R_{neck}+R_{dendrite}}}$$", "id": "1745314"}, {"introduction": "After a neuron integrates the myriad of inputs from its dendrites, it faces a critical decision: to fire an action potential or to remain silent. This all-or-none decision is made at the axon hillock, a specialized region where the axon emerges from the cell body. This practice explores the fundamental reason for the axon hillock's role as the 'trigger zone'—its exceptionally high density of voltage-gated sodium channels. You will calculate how a change in this channel density alters the neuron's firing threshold, providing a quantitative understanding of neuronal excitability [@problem_id:1745360].", "problem": "A neurophysiologist is studying a computational model of a mammalian neuron. In its healthy state, the neuron maintains a resting membrane potential of $V_{rest} = -70$ mV. The axon hillock, the region where action potentials are initiated, has a specific minimum membrane potential of $V_{th, normal} = -55$ mV that must be reached to trigger an all-or-none action potential. The neuron receives excitatory inputs, and the temporal and spatial summation of one standardized excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) results in a depolarization of $\\Delta V_{EPSP} = 0.5$ mV at the axon hillock.\n\nThe researcher then models a genetic disorder that reduces the density of voltage-gated sodium channels at the axon hillock to 35% of its normal value. This change does not affect the neuron's resting membrane potential or the magnitude of a single standardized EPSP. However, it alters the neuron's excitability. For this model, you should assume that the magnitude of the depolarization required to fire an action potential, defined as the difference between the firing potential and the resting potential $(V_{th} - V_{rest})$, is inversely proportional to the density of voltage-gated sodium channels at the axon hillock.\n\nCalculate the minimum number of additional simultaneous EPSPs required to bring the axon hillock of the disordered neuron to its new firing potential, compared to the number required for the healthy neuron. The number of EPSPs must be an integer.", "solution": "Let the resting and threshold potentials be $V_{rest}$ and $V_{th}$, and define the required depolarization (threshold gap) as $G \\equiv V_{th}-V_{rest}$.
