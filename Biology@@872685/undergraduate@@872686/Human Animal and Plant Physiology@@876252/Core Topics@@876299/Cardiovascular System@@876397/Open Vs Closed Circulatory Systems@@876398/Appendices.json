The mass of the heart muscle, $M_{\\mathrm{heart}}$, is directly proportional to its sustainable power output, $P_{\\mathrm{heart}}$.\n4.  **System-Dependent Pressure Scaling:** The pressure difference, $\\Delta p$, that the heart must generate scales differently with body mass for the two types of circulatory systems.\n    *   **Closed Systems:** These are high-pressure, high-resistance systems where blood is confined to vessels. Assume that for an efficiently designed, branching vascular network, the total pressure drop the heart must overcome is approximately independent of the animal's body mass.\n    *   **Open Systems:** These are low-pressure, low-resistance systems where hemolymph is pumped into a general body cavity (the hemocoel).
