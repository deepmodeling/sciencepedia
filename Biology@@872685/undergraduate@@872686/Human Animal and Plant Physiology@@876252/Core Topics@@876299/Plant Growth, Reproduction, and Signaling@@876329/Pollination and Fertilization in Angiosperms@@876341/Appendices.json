{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding a plant's reproductive strategy is a cornerstone of ecology and evolution. This practice challenges you to think like a field botanist, interpreting the results of a classic experimental design to determine whether a plant is an outcrosser or capable of self-fertilization. By analyzing the outcomes of controlled pollinations [@problem_id:2278431], you will gain insight into the rigorous logic scientists use to uncover the secrets of plant mating systems.", "problem": "A botanist is studying the reproductive biology of a newly discovered angiosperm species, *Botanica investigata*. The flowers of this species are perfect, meaning they contain both male (stamens) and female (pistil) reproductive organs. To determine the plant's breeding system, the botanist conducts an experiment on 400 flowers across several individuals. The flowers are divided into four equal groups of 100.\n\n- **Group 1 (Control):** Flowers were left untouched and exposed to the natural environment, where various insects were observed visiting the flowers.\n- **Group 2 (Bagging):** Flowers were enclosed in fine-mesh bags before their stigmas became receptive. The bags prevented insects from visiting but allowed air and light to pass through.\n- **Group 3 (Emasculation and Bagging):** Before the flowers opened, their stamens were carefully removed (a process called emasculation). The flowers were then immediately enclosed in fine-mesh bags.\n- **Group 4 (Emasculation and Hand-Pollination):** Flowers were emasculated as in Group 3. Once their stigmas became receptive, they were manually dusted with pollen collected from a different plant of the same species located 100 meters away. After hand-pollination, the flowers were also enclosed in fine-mesh bags.\n\nAfter several weeks, the botanist recorded the number of flowers in each group that successfully developed into mature fruits containing seeds. The results are as follows:\n\n- **Group 1:** 82 flowers developed into fruit.\n- **Group 2:** 0 flowers developed into fruit.\n- **Group 3:** 0 flowers developed into fruit.\n- **Group 4:** 89 flowers developed into fruit.\n\nBased on these experimental results, what is the most likely conclusion about the breeding system of *Botanica investigata*?\n\nA. The plant is an obligate self-pollinator and depends on wind, not insects, for pollination.\n\nB. The plant is capable of both self-pollination and cross-pollination, but cross-pollination is more successful.\n\nC. The plant reproduces asexually through a process like apomixis, where seeds develop without fertilization.\n\nD. The plant is an obligate cross-pollinator (outcrosser) and likely has a self-incompatibility mechanism.\n\nE. The experiment is flawed, as the process of bagging damaged the flowers, preventing any fruit development.", "solution": "We analyze each treatment against the predictions of different breeding systems.\n\n1. Interpretations of the treatments:\n- Group 1 (control, open to visitors): If the plant is animal-pollinated and compatible with cross-pollen, we expect substantial fruit set due to natural pollination.\n- Group 2 (bagged, intact flowers): If the plant can self-fertilize autonomously (autogamy) or reproduce asexually (apomixis), some fruit should set without pollinators. If it is wind-pollinated and the mesh allows airborne pollen, some fruit might also set. If it is obligately outcrossing and self-incompatible, with no pollinator access, fruit set should be near zero.\n- Group 3 (emasculated and bagged): With stamens removed and no pollen applied, only apomixis could yield fruit; otherwise, fruit set should be zero.\n- Group 4 (emasculated, hand-crossed, bagged): If cross-pollen is compatible, fruit set should be high; this also tests that bagging itself does not prevent fruit development.\n\n2. Match observations to predictions:\n- Group 2 yielded $0/100$ fruits. This rules out autonomous selfing and strongly argues against apomixis. It also argues against obligate wind pollination as the sole mechanism because, with air movement permitted, at least some fruit might be expected if wind-borne pollen could reach stigmas; moreover, the decisive comparison is with Group 4 (see below), which shows the bags themselves did not prevent fertilization or fruit development once compatible pollen was applied.\n- Group 3 yielded $0/100$ fruits, which directly rules out apomixis (no seeds without fertilization).\n- Group 4 yielded $89/100$ fruits after manual application of cross-pollen, demonstrating that outcross pollen is fully compatible and that the bagging treatment did not damage flowers or prevent fruit development.\n- Group 1 yielded $82/100$ fruits under natural visitation, consistent with effective animal-mediated pollination; the slightly lower value than Group 4 suggests natural pollination is somewhat limited compared to controlled hand-crossing, as is commonly observed.\n\n3. Synthesize the breeding system inference:\n- The complete absence of fruit in Group 2 despite the presence of anthers and stigmas within the same bag excludes autonomous selfing and, coupled with the success of hand-crossing in Group 4, points to a requirement for outcross pollen.\n- The success of Group 4 combined with the failure of Group 2 is most parsimoniously explained by self-incompatibility: self-pollen fails to fertilize, whereas cross-pollen succeeds.\n- The success of Group 1 with insect visitation identifies biotic pollination (insect pollinators) as the natural mechanism; bagging did not itself preclude fruit set once compatible pollen was supplied (Group 4), so the lack of fruit in Group 2 is not due to bag damage.\n\n4. Eliminate incorrect options:\n- A is contradicted by the lack of fruit in Group 2 and the success with insect access in Group 1; also, Group 4 shows bagging does not prevent fruit set once compatible pollen is present.\n- B is not supported because there is no evidence of successful selfing; Group 2 shows no autonomous selfing, and no treatment demonstrates successful self-pollination.\n- C is ruled out by $0/100$ in Groups 2 and 3.\n- E is ruled out because Group 4 fruits developed despite bagging.\n\nTherefore, the data support that the species is an obligate outcrosser, likely with a self-incompatibility mechanism.\n\nThe correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2278431"}, {"introduction": "To avoid the negative effects of inbreeding, many angiosperms have evolved sophisticated genetic systems to recognize and reject their own pollen. This problem focuses on gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI), a key mechanism that promotes outcrossing and genetic diversity. By applying the \"lock-and-key\" logic of S-alleles [@problem_id:2278403], you can predict the success or failure of various crosses, deepening your understanding of the genetic basis of plant reproduction.", "problem": "A botanist is studying a species of wild cherry that exhibits gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) to prevent inbreeding. This mechanism is controlled by a single genetic locus, the S-locus, which has multiple alleles (e.g., $S_1, S_2, S_3, \\dots$). In this GSI system, successful fertilization is blocked if the allele expressed by the haploid male gametophyte (the pollen grain) matches any of the alleles present in the diploid tissue of the female pistil (the stigma and style).\n\nThe botanist identifies a specific tree, which we will call the \"recipient tree,\" with the S-locus genotype $S_3S_4$. In the surrounding grove, there are four other trees that are potential pollen donors, with the following genotypes:\n- Donor Tree 1: Genotype $S_1S_2$\n- Donor Tree 2: Genotype $S_2S_3$\n- Donor Tree 3: Genotype $S_3S_4$\n- Donor Tree 4: Genotype $S_1S_5$\n\nBased on the rules of gametophytic self-incompatibility, identify all of the following pollination events that would result in the successful fertilization of at least some of the ovules of the recipient tree ($S_3S_4$).\n\nA. Pollen from Donor Tree 1 is transferred to the recipient tree.\n\nB. Pollen from Donor Tree 2 is transferred to the recipient tree.\n\nC. Pollen from Donor Tree 3 is transferred to the recipient tree.\n\nD. Pollen from Donor Tree 4 is transferred to the recipient tree.", "solution": "Under gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI), the compatibility rule is: a haploid pollen grain carrying allele $S_{i}$ is rejected by a pistil if and only if $S_{i}$ matches either of the pistil’s diploid alleles. The recipient pistil has genotype $S_{3}S_{4}$, so any pollen grain carrying $S_{3}$ or $S_{4}$ is rejected; any pollen grain carrying an allele not in $\\{S_{3},S_{4}\\}$ is accepted. For each donor, we enumerate the pollen types produced and test them against the recipient’s alleles. Fertilization of at least some ovules occurs if at least one pollen type from the donor is accepted.\n\nFor A (donor $S_{1}S_{2}$): Pollen types are $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$. Since neither $S_{1}$ nor $S_{2}$ equals $S_{3}$ or $S_{4}$, both pollen types are accepted. Therefore, fertilization occurs.\n\nFor B (donor $S_{2}S_{3}$): Pollen types are $S_{2}$ and $S_{3}$. Pollen $S_{3}$ is rejected (matches $S_{3}$ in the pistil), while pollen $S_{2}$ is accepted (not in $\\{S_{3},S_{4}\\}$). Since at least one pollen type is accepted, fertilization occurs.\n\nFor C (donor $S_{3}S_{4}$): Pollen types are $S_{3}$ and $S_{4}$. Both match the pistil’s alleles and are rejected. Therefore, no fertilization occurs.\n\nFor D (donor $S_{1}S_{5}$): Pollen types are $S_{1}$ and $S_{5}$. Neither matches $S_{3}$ or $S_{4}$, so both are accepted.
