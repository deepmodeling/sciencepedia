By analyzing a hypothetical \"never-ripe\" tomato, you can deduce the point of failure within the ethylene signal transduction pathway. This practice is essential for understanding the logic of signaling cascades and the distinct roles of positive and negative regulators. [@problem_id:1733110]", "problem": "In an agricultural biotechnology project, a new line of tomato plants is genetically engineered. These plants produce fruits that exhibit a \"never-ripe\" phenotype; they grow to full size but fail to soften, change color, or develop characteristic flavors. Crucially, these tomatoes remain unripe even when exposed to high atmospheric concentrations of ethylene, a gaseous plant hormone known to be the primary trigger for ripening in normal tomatoes.\n\nTo understand the molecular basis of this phenotype, consider the following simplified model of the ethylene signal transduction pathway in a normal plant cell:\n\n1.  In the absence of ethylene, membrane-bound receptors activate a protein kinase known as CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE 1 (CTR1).\n2.  Active CTR1 acts as a negative regulator by phosphorylating and thereby inactivating a key signaling protein called ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 2 (EIN2), which is tethered to the endoplasmic reticulum.\n3.  When ethylene gas binds to its receptors, the receptor-CTR1 complex is inactivated.\n4.  Consequently, CTR1 no longer phosphorylates EIN2. The now de-phosphorylated (active) EIN2 undergoes cleavage, and its C-terminal fragment translocates to the nucleus.\n5.  In the nucleus, the EIN2 fragment promotes the activity of transcription factors, such as ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3 (EIN3), by protecting them from degradation. These active transcription factors then turn on a cascade of genes required for the ripening process.\n\nAssuming the \"never-ripe\" phenotype in the engineered tomatoes is caused by a single loss-of-function mutation that renders one of the following protein components completely non-functional, which component is the most likely target of the mutation?\n\nA. The ethylene receptor\n\nB. The CTR1 kinase\n\nC. The EIN2 protein\n\nD. The protease responsible for degrading the EIN3 transcription factor", "solution": "Begin by restating the causal sequence in a normal cell.\n\nIn the absence of ethylene:\n- Receptors are active and activate CTR1. Symbolically:\n$$R_{\\text{active}} \\Rightarrow CTR1_{\\text{active}}.$$\n- Active CTR1 phosphorylates EIN2, keeping it inactive:\n$$CTR1_{\\text{active}} \\Rightarrow \\text{P-}EIN2 \\equiv EIN2_{\\text{inactive}}.$$\n- Inactive EIN2 cannot promote EIN3 stabilization, so ripening genes are not expressed:\n$$EIN2_{\\text{inactive}} \\Rightarrow EIN3 \\text{ degraded} \\Rightarrow \\text{no ripening}.$$\n\nIn the presence of ethylene:\n- Ethylene binding inactivates the receptor-CTR1 complex:\n$$\\text{ethylene bound } R \\Rightarrow CTR1_{\\text{inactive}}.$$\n- CTR1 no longer phosphorylates EIN2; EIN2 becomes dephosphorylated and active, gets cleaved, and its C-terminus moves to the nucleus:\n$$CTR1_{\\text{inactive}} \\Rightarrow EIN2_{\\text{deP, active}} \\Rightarrow \\text{EIN2-C to nucleus}.$$\n- Nuclear EIN2 fragment stabilizes EIN3 (by preventing its degradation), allowing activation of ripening genes:\n$$EIN2_{\\text{active}} \\Rightarrow EIN3 \\text{ stabilized} \\Rightarrow \\text{ripening gene expression} \\Rightarrow \\text{ripening}.$$\n\nNow evaluate the effect of a complete loss-of-function in each component:\n\nA. Ethylene receptor (loss-of-function). In this model, receptors are negative regulators that, when active, keep CTR1 active. A non-functional receptor cannot activate CTR1. This mimics the ethylene-bound (inactivated receptor) state:\n$$R_{\\text{nonfunctional}} \\Rightarrow CTR1_{\\text{inactive}} \\Rightarrow EIN2_{\\text{active}} \\Rightarrow EIN3 \\text{ stabilized} \\Rightarrow \\text{ripening}.$$\nPrediction: constitutive or enhanced ripening, not a never-ripe phenotype. Thus A is inconsistent.\n\nB. CTR1 kinase (loss-of-function). Without CTR1 activity, EIN2 is not phosphorylated and remains active regardless of ethylene:\n$$CTR1_{\\text{nonfunctional}} \\Rightarrow EIN2_{\\text{active}} \\Rightarrow EIN3 \\text{ stabilized} \\Rightarrow \\text{ripening}.$$\nPrediction: constitutive ripening. Thus B is inconsistent.\n\nC. EIN2 protein (loss-of-function). EIN2 is an essential positive regulator downstream of CTR1. If EIN2 is non-functional, then even when ethylene inactivates CTR1, the signal cannot proceed to stabilize EIN3:\n$$EIN2_{\\text{nonfunctional}} \\Rightarrow \\text{no EIN2-C nuclear signal} \\Rightarrow EIN3 \\text{ degraded} \\Rightarrow \\text{no ripening},$$\neven at high ethylene. Prediction: ethylene-insensitive never-ripe phenotype. Thus C matches.\n\nD. Protease degrading EIN3 (loss-of-function). If the protease that normally degrades EIN3 is non-functional, EIN3 accumulates and activates ripening genes independently of upstream signals:\n$$\\text{protease}_{\\text{nonfunctional}} \\Rightarrow EIN3 \\text{ stabilized} \\Rightarrow \\text{ripening}.$$\nPrediction: constitutive ripening. Thus D is inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, the only loss-of-function that yields a never-ripe phenotype even at high ethylene is loss of EIN2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1733110"}, {"introduction": "Ethylene's identity as a gas gives it a unique role in communication, not just within a plant but between separate individuals.

The experiment uses three distinct setups, each involving tomato plants with green, unripe fruit placed in sealed, transparent chambers under optimal conditions for growth and ripening (light, water, temperature).\n\n*   **Setup 1:** Two separate, sealed chambers. Chamber 1A contains Plant A and Chamber 1B contains Plant B. Both plants are healthy and unwounded. The chambers are completely isolated from each other.\n*   **Setup 2:** Two chambers are connected by a tube with a small fan to ensure air circulation from the first chamber to the second. Chamber 2A contains Plant C, whose leaves are mechanically damaged by crushing at the start of the experiment.

Mechanical wounding induces ethylene biosynthesis via the wound response (upregulation of ACC synthase and ACC oxidase), increasing ethylene emission. Ethylene diffuses through air and can act nonlocally. Potassium permanganate oxidatively removes ethylene from air, preventing its signaling effect.\n\nAnalyze each setup:\n\n1) Setup 1 (A and B in completely isolated, sealed chambers; both unwounded): With no air exchange between chambers, there is no inter-plant ethylene transfer. Plant B is untouched and only experiences its own endogenous ethylene. Over the short experimental window described as “several days” starting from green, unripe fruit, and without an external ethylene source, the most likely observation (in contrast to the accelerated ripening in Setup 2) is that Plant B remains unripe.\n\n2) Setup 2 (Air flows from wounded Plant C to untouched Plant D): Wounding Plant C elevates ethylene production, and the fan drives this ethylene into Chamber 2B. Ethylene exposure accelerates ripening in Plant D, so Plant D ripens.\n\n3) Setup 3 (Air flows from wounded Plant E to untouched Plant F, but through a potassium permanganate filter): The filter removes ethylene from the airflow, preventing the ethylene produced by E from reaching F. Therefore, Plant F does not receive the exogenous ethylene cue that accelerates ripening and, over the same time frame, remains unripe.\n\nCombining these: Plant B remains unripe, Plant D ripens, Plant F remains unripe.

This practice reinforces your knowledge of ethylene's classic physiological effects, such as its influence on growth, senescence, and fruit ripening. [@problem_id:1733119]", "problem": "A team of plant biologists is studying a newly discovered mutant of a tomato plant (*Solanum lycopersicum*). Through genetic sequencing, they determine that this mutant possesses a loss-of-function mutation in a gene that codes for a key negative regulator protein in the ethylene signal transduction pathway. The consequence of this mutation is that the ethylene response pathway is constitutively active, meaning it is permanently \"switched on,\" even in the complete absence of the ethylene hormone itself.\n\nAssuming the mutant plant is viable and grown under the same optimal light, water, and nutrient conditions as a wild-type (non-mutant) tomato plant, which of the following sets of phenotypic characteristics would be most expected in the mutant plant compared to the wild-type?\n\nA. Markedly increased stem elongation, delayed fruit ripening, and a prolonged leaf lifespan (delayed senescence).\n\nB. Prolific growth of axillary buds creating a very bushy appearance, delayed leaf yellowing, and an unusually large and deep root system.\n\nC. Reduced stem elongation resulting in a shorter plant, increased stem thickness, premature yellowing and dropping of leaves, and accelerated ripening of fruits.\n\nD. Strong directional growth towards light sources (phototropism), a tall and largely unbranched main stem, and the development of extensive roots from the base of the stem.\n\nE. Accelerated stem elongation, very thin and weak stems, and premature dropping of flowers before fruit can set.", "solution": "We are told there is a loss-of-function mutation in a gene encoding a key negative regulator in the ethylene signaling pathway. In plant hormone signaling, a loss-of-function in a negative regulator causes constitutive activation of the downstream pathway even in the absence of the hormone. In ethylene signaling, canonical examples include the negative regulator CTR1; when negative regulation is lost, downstream components such as EIN2 and EIN3/EILs are active and ethylene responses are expressed constitutively.\n\nTherefore, the mutant expresses ethylene responses at all times, even without ethylene. Ethylene’s hallmark physiological effects include:\n- Inhibition of stem (cell) elongation and promotion of radial swelling, resulting in shorter, thicker stems (part of the classic triple response in etiolated seedlings).\n- Promotion of leaf senescence (yellowing) and abscission (dropping of leaves, flowers, and sometimes fruit organs).\n- Acceleration of ripening in climacteric fruits such as tomato.\n- Epinasty (downward bending of leaves) and often reduced apical dominance is not the principal hallmark; auxin primarily governs apical dominance. Ethylene can promote adventitious rooting but typically does not lead to increased elongation or delayed senescence.\n\nNow evaluate each option against the expected ethylene-constitutive phenotype:\n- A: “Markedly increased stem elongation, delayed fruit ripening, and prolonged leaf lifespan.” This is opposite to ethylene action, which inhibits elongation, accelerates ripening, and promotes senescence. Reject.\n- B: “Prolific axillary buds, delayed leaf yellowing, large and deep root system.” Ethylene does not delay senescence; it promotes it. Although ethylene can affect branching and roots, the delayed yellowing is inconsistent. Reject.\n- C: “Reduced stem elongation resulting in a shorter plant, increased stem thickness, premature yellowing and dropping of leaves, and accelerated ripening of fruits.” This matches ethylene responses: inhibited elongation with radial swelling, senescence/abscission, and faster ripening. Accept.\n- D: “Strong phototropism, tall unbranched stem, extensive roots from base.” Tall unbranched stems reflect auxin-driven elongation, not ethylene. While ethylene can induce adventitious roots, the elongation aspect is inconsistent. Reject.\n- E: “Accelerated stem elongation, very thin and weak stems, premature dropping of flowers.” Ethylene can promote abscission of flowers, but it does not accelerate elongation; it reduces it and increases stem thickness.
