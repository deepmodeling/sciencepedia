{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Plant biotechnology often relies on manipulating the developmental fate of plant cells in culture. A cornerstone of this field is understanding how to direct cells to either divide without specializing or differentiate into specific tissues. This practice problem places you in the role of a biotechnologist, challenging you to apply the classic principle of the auxin-to-cytokinin ratio to achieve the foundational step of micropropagation: creating an undifferentiated callus. [@problem_id:1732798]", "problem": "A plant biotechnologist is tasked with developing a micropropagation protocol for a rare orchid species to aid in its conservation. The protocol begins with establishing an aseptic culture using a small explant (a piece of stem tissue). The explant is placed on a sterile nutrient medium containing all necessary minerals, vitamins, and sucrose. The immediate goal is to induce the formation of a callus, which is a mass of undifferentiated, proliferating plant cells. From this callus, whole plants can later be regenerated. To achieve this, the biotechnologist must supplement the medium with the correct plant hormones.\n\nAssuming the two most critical hormone classes for this process are auxins and cytokinins, which of the following hormonal treatments should be added to the culture medium to most effectively promote the development and growth of an undifferentiated callus?\n\nA. A high concentration of an auxin and a low concentration of a cytokinin.\n\nB. A low concentration of an auxin and a high concentration of a cytokinin.\n\nC. Approximately equal and intermediate concentrations of an auxin and a cytokinin.\n\nD. A high concentration of an auxin only, with no cytokinin added.\n\nE. A high concentration of a cytokinin only, with no auxin added.\n\nF. No hormones added, allowing the explant's endogenous hormones to control development.", "solution": "The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the synergistic and antagonistic roles of two major classes of plant hormones, auxins and cytokinins, in controlling cell division and differentiation in plant tissue culture. This relationship was famously established by Folke Skoog and Carlos O. Miller.\n\n1.  **Hormone Roles**: Auxins primarily promote cell elongation and are the principal hormones involved in initiating root development (rhizogenesis). Cytokinins primarily promote cell division (cytokinesis) and are the main drivers of shoot development (caulogenesis).\n\n2.  **The Auxin-to-Cytokinin Ratio**: The crucial discovery was that it is not the absolute concentration of either hormone alone, but rather the *ratio* of auxin to cytokinin concentration that dictates the developmental fate of the cultured tissue.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Ratios**:\n    *   A high auxin-to-cytokinin ratio (more auxin than cytokinin) signals the tissue to differentiate and form roots.\n    *   A low auxin-to-cytokinin ratio (more cytokinin than auxin) signals the tissue to differentiate and form shoots.\n    *   An intermediate or balanced ratio, where the concentrations of auxin and cytokinin are roughly equal, promotes rapid cell division but simultaneously suppresses differentiation into organized structures like roots or shoots. This state of undifferentiated proliferation results in the formation of a callus.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Options**:\n    *   **A (High Auxin / Low Cytokinin)**: This would strongly promote root formation, not an undifferentiated callus.\n    *   **B (Low Auxin / High Cytokinin)**: This would strongly promote shoot formation, not an undifferentiated callus.\n    *   **C (Approximately Equal Auxin and Cytokinin)**: This balanced ratio is the classic recipe for inducing and maintaining a state of undifferentiated cell proliferation, which is the definition of a callus. This is the correct choice.\n    *   **D (Auxin Only)**: This would likely induce some rooting, but it would be less effective than a proper ratio and would not promote the sustained, undifferentiated growth characteristic of a healthy callus.\n    *   **E (Cytokinin Only)**: This might induce some bud formation but would be unlikely to support sustained proliferation and would not lead to a callus.\n    *   **F (No Hormones)**: While the explant contains some endogenous hormones, the levels are typically insufficient to stimulate the significant cell division required for callus formation. The tissue would likely senesce or exhibit very limited growth.\n\nTherefore, to achieve the goal of forming an undifferentiated callus, the biotechnologist must provide a medium with balanced levels of both auxin and cytokinin.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1732798"}, {"introduction": "For a hormone to exert its powerful influence, a cell must first 'hear' its message through a process known as signal transduction, which begins at a specific receptor. This exercise delves into the molecular mechanics of cytokinin action, focusing on the very first step in its signaling cascade. By considering a mutant plant with a faulty receptor, you can deduce the absolute necessity of each step in the pathway for a physiological response to occur. [@problem_id:1732778]", "problem": "In many higher plants, the cytokinin hormone family plays a crucial role in regulating cell division, shoot initiation, and leaf senescence. The primary signal transduction pathway for cytokinins, such as zeatin, is a multi-step phosphorelay system often called a two-component system. A simplified version of this canonical pathway is as follows:\n\n1.  Cytokinin binds to a histidine kinase receptor located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.\n2.  Upon binding, the receptor undergoes autophosphorylation, where it adds a phosphate group to a specific histidine residue on its own structure.\n3.  The phosphate group is then transferred from the receptor to a mobile protein called an Arabidopsis Histidine Phosphotransfer (AHP) protein.\n4.  The phosphorylated AHP protein translocates to the nucleus and transfers the phosphate group to a Type-B Arabidopsis Response Regulator (ARR), which is a transcription factor.\n5.  Phosphorylation activates the Type-B ARR, causing it to bind to DNA and initiate the transcription of cytokinin-responsive genes, which ultimately leads to the observable physiological effects.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered plant in which the cytokinin histidine kinase receptors have been mutated. These mutant receptors can still bind to cytokinin molecules with normal affinity, but a change in their catalytic domain renders them completely incapable of autophosphorylation.\n\nWhat is the most likely primary outcome when a solution of zeatin is applied to the tissues of this mutant plant?\n\nA. The plant will show no significant change in cytokinin-regulated processes, as the signal transduction cascade cannot be initiated.\n\nB. The plant will exhibit an extremely strong cytokinin response, as the mutation makes the receptors constitutively active.\n\nC. The plant will show a normal response, because the binding of zeatin is the only step required for signal activation.\n\nD. The Arabidopsis Histidine Phosphotransfer (AHP) proteins will become phosphorylated, but the Type-B response regulators (ARRs) will remain inactive.\n\nE. The plant will degrade the externally applied zeatin at an accelerated rate, preventing any cellular response.", "solution": "The canonical cytokinin signaling pathway is a multi-step His-Asp phosphorelay. The logical dependencies between steps are:\n1. Ligand binding to the histidine kinase (HK) receptor is necessary but not sufficient for signal propagation; the next step requires catalytic activity.\n2. Upon ligand binding, the HK must perform autophosphorylation on a specific histidine residue of the receptor. This generates the high-energy phosphohistidine intermediate that is the phosphate donor for subsequent steps.\n3. The phosphoryl group is then transferred from the receptor to an AHP protein.\n4. The phosphorylated AHP enters the nucleus and transfers the phosphate to a Type-B ARR.\n5. Phosphorylated Type-B ARR activates transcription of cytokinin-responsive genes, producing physiological responses.\n\nIn the mutant described, receptors bind cytokinin normally but are completely incapable of autophosphorylation. Therefore:\n- There is no formation of the phosphohistidine on the receptor.\n- Without a phosphorylated receptor, there is no phosphate available to transfer to AHP proteins; AHP remains unphosphorylated.\n- Without phosphorylated AHP, Type-B ARRs cannot be phosphorylated and thus remain inactive.\n- Ligand binding alone, in the absence of receptor autophosphorylation, does not activate transcriptional responses in this two-component system.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Correct. The signaling cascade cannot be initiated because autophosphorylation is the essential first catalytic step post-binding.\n- B: Incorrect. The mutation eliminates catalytic activity; it does not create constitutive activity.\n- C: Incorrect. Binding is not sufficient; phosphorylation is required to propagate the signal.\n- D: Incorrect. AHP proteins cannot become phosphorylated without the receptor’s autophosphorylation step providing the phosphate.\n- E: Incorrect. There is no basis to infer accelerated zeatin degradation as a primary outcome of a receptor catalytic-domain mutation.\n\nThus, the most likely primary outcome is no significant change in cytokinin-regulated processes upon zeatin application.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1732778"}, {"introduction": "The elegant architecture of a plant is not accidental; it is sculpted by a constant dialogue between hormonal signals. One of the most visible examples of this is apical dominance, which determines whether a plant grows tall and slender or short and bushy. This problem bridges the gap between molecular signaling and whole-plant form, asking you to predict the branching phenotype of a plant that is 'deaf' to cytokinin in its shoots, revealing the hormone's crucial role in counteracting auxin and promoting lateral growth. [@problem_id:1732843]", "problem": "In vascular plants, the growth of the main central stem at the expense of side branches is a phenomenon known as apical dominance. This process is primarily regulated by the interplay between two key plant hormones: auxin and cytokinin. Auxin is synthesized in the shoot apical meristem (the tip of the main stem) and transported downwards, where it acts to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds (the buds that form in the axils of leaves, which can grow into side branches). Conversely, cytokinin is synthesized mainly in the roots and transported upwards through the xylem, where it promotes cell division and counteracts the inhibitory effect of auxin, thus encouraging axillary bud outgrowth.\n\nA team of plant biologists has developed a mutant strain of a model plant. This mutant is unique because it has a targeted genetic knockout that eliminates the expression of all primary cytokinin receptor proteins. This lack of receptors is confined specifically to the tissues of the shoot system (stem, leaves, and axillary buds). The synthesis and long-distance transport of both auxin and cytokinin in this mutant are completely normal and identical to a wild-type plant.\n\nBased on this information and the established roles of these hormones in regulating apical dominance, which of the following phenotypes would you most likely expect to observe in the branching pattern of this mutant plant when compared to a wild-type plant?\n\nA. The plant will exhibit enhanced apical dominance, characterized by a single, tall main stem with significantly reduced or absent axillary bud outgrowth.\n\nB. The plant will show a complete loss of apical dominance, resulting in a bushy phenotype due to the extensive and uncontrolled outgrowth of all axillary buds.\n\nC. The plant's branching pattern will be indistinguishable from that of a wild-type plant, as the concentration of cytokinin transported from the roots is the sole factor determining bud growth.\n\nD. The plant will develop an unusual number of adventitious shoots emerging directly from the root system, while the aerial shoot remains unbranched.\n\nE. The axillary buds will grow out normally, but the plant will exhibit rapid aging and yellowing of its leaves (accelerated senescence).", "solution": "Apical dominance arises from the antagonistic interaction between auxin and cytokinin in the shoot. Auxin, synthesized in the shoot apical meristem and transported basipetally, inhibits axillary bud outgrowth. Cytokinin, synthesized mainly in roots and transported acropetally via the xylem, promotes cell division in axillary buds and counteracts auxin’s inhibitory effect. Crucially, cytokinin must be perceived by cytokinin receptors in shoot tissues (including axillary buds) to exert this promotive effect.\n\nIn the described mutant, auxin synthesis and transport are normal, and cytokinin synthesis and transport to the shoot are also normal. However, all primary cytokinin receptors are genetically eliminated specifically in shoot tissues (stem, leaves, axillary buds). Therefore, even though cytokinin arrives in the shoot at normal concentrations, it cannot be perceived or transduced in the shoot. Functionally, the effective cytokinin signaling in the shoot is absent.\n\nWithout cytokinin perception in axillary buds, there is no hormonal counteraction to auxin’s inhibitory effect on bud outgrowth. Hence, the balance of hormonal regulation shifts toward stronger auxin-mediated suppression of axillary buds. The expected phenotype is enhanced apical dominance: a pronounced single main stem with reduced or absent lateral branching.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A matches the predicted enhancement of apical dominance due to loss of cytokinin signaling in the shoot.\n- B requires loss of auxin action or heightened cytokinin signaling; neither is true here.\n- C incorrectly assumes cytokinin concentration alone determines response and ignores the necessity of receptor-mediated perception.\n- D proposes adventitious shoots from roots; although roots retain cytokinin receptors, any emerging shoot tissues are still shoot tissues lacking receptors, making this outcome unlikely.\n- E pairs a plausible effect (accelerated senescence from lack of cytokinin perception in leaves) with an incorrect claim that axillary buds grow normally; without cytokinin signaling, axillary bud outgrowth would be suppressed.\n\nTherefore, the most likely phenotype is enhanced apical dominance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1732843"}]}
