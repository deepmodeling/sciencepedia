By analyzing the effects of different light flashes during a long night, you will practice predicting flowering based on the final state of the phytochrome pigment, $P_{fr}$.", "problem": "Researchers at a controlled-environment agriculture facility are studying the flowering of a specific cultivar of soybean, which is known to be a short-day plant (SDP). This particular cultivar has a critical night length of 10 hours, meaning it requires a period of uninterrupted darkness of at least this duration to initiate flowering.\n\nThe researchers set up five different experimental growth chambers. In all chambers, the plants are initially subjected to a baseline photoperiod consisting of 13 hours of light and 11 hours of darkness. The following modifications are made during the middle of the 11-hour dark period:\n\n*   **Treatment 1:** The 11-hour dark period is left completely uninterrupted.\n*   **Treatment 2:** The dark period is interrupted by a brief, intense flash of red light (R).\n*   **Treatment 3:** The dark period is interrupted by a brief, intense flash of far-red light (FR).\n*   **Treatment 4:** The dark period is interrupted by a brief flash of red light (R) immediately followed by a brief flash of far-red light (FR).\n*   **Treatment 5:** The dark period is interrupted by a brief flash of far-red light (FR) immediately followed by a brief flash of red light (R).\n\nAssuming all other growth conditions (temperature, humidity, nutrients) are optimal, which of the experimental treatments would be expected to result in the soybean plants flowering?\n\nA. Treatments 1 and 4 only\n\nB. Treatments 2 and 5 only\n\nC. Treatments 1, 3, and 4\n\nD. Treatments 3 and 5 only\n\nE. All treatments", "solution": "Given a short-day plant (SDP) with critical night length $N_{c}=10$ hours, flowering requires an uninterrupted dark interval of duration at least $N_{c}$ under which the phytochrome system remains in a non-inhibitory state. The phytochrome photoreversibility is:\n$$\nP_r \\xrightarrow{R} P_{fr}, \\qquad P_{fr} \\xrightarrow{FR} P_r.\n$$\nFor SDPs, $P_{fr}$ is inhibitory to flowering, while a low $P_{fr}$ (i.e., high $P_r$) state during the night permits flowering.\n\nBaseline photoperiod is $13$ hours light and $11$ hours dark, so without interruption $N=11 \\geq N_{c}$ and flowering occurs.\n\nEvaluate each treatment:\n\n- Treatment 1 (uninterrupted $11$-hour dark): There is a single continuous dark interval of length $11 \\geq 10$ hours, and $P_{fr}$ decays during the dark. Expect flowering.\n\n- Treatment 2 (red flash in middle): The red flash converts $P_r\\to P_{fr}$, provides a night-break signal, and splits the dark into two intervals each shorter than $10$ hours. The $P_{fr}$ state is inhibitory. Expect no flowering.\n\n- Treatment 3 (far-red flash in middle): The far-red flash converts any remaining $P_{fr}\\to P_r$. A brief FR pulse does not produce the inhibitory red night-break effect and leaves the system in the permissive $P_r$ state. The effective long night is not nullified. Expect flowering.\n\n- Treatment 4 (red followed by far-red): $R$ sets $P_{fr}$ (inhibitory), and immediate $FR$ reverses it to $P_r$, thereby cancelling the red night-break effect. Expect flowering.\n\n- Treatment 5 (far-red followed by red): $FR$ sets $P_r$, but subsequent $R$ converts to inhibitory $P_{fr}$, acting as a night break. Expect no flowering.\n\nThus, flowering occurs in Treatments 1, 3, and 4, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1728109"}, {"introduction": "While the phytochrome system is a near-universal timekeeper in plants, its signal is interpreted differently depending on the species' strategy. This problem [@problem_id:1728077] challenges you to apply the night-break principle to both a Short-Day Plant (SDP) and a Long-Day Plant (LDP) simultaneously. By predicting the flowering outcome for each, you'll reinforce the crucial concept that the active $P_{fr}$ form of phytochrome inhibits flowering in SDPs but promotes it in LDPs, demonstrating that the same cue can trigger opposite responses.", "problem": "An agricultural scientist is investigating the photoperiodic control of flowering in two different plant species. Plant A is a Short-Day Plant (SDP), defined as a plant that flowers only when the continuous period of darkness exceeds a specific critical night length. Plant B is a Long-Day Plant (LDP), defined as a plant that flowers only when the continuous period of darkness is shorter than a specific critical night length.\n\nFor Plant A, the critical night length is 11 hours.\nFor Plant B, the critical night length is 13 hours.\n\nBoth plants are subjected to a repeating daily cycle consisting of 8 hours of light followed by 16 hours of darkness. However, in this experiment, the 16-hour dark period is interrupted exactly at its midpoint by a brief, intense flash of red light.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following outcomes is expected?\n\nA. Both Plant A and Plant B will flower.\n\nB. Neither Plant A nor Plant B will flower.\n\nC. Plant A will flower, but Plant B will not.\n\nD. Plant B will flower, but Plant A will not.", "solution": "The central principle governing this problem is the mechanism of photoperiodism, which plants use to measure the length of the night. This process is controlled by a photoreceptor pigment called phytochrome. Phytochrome exists in two interconvertible forms: $P_r$ (absorbs red light) and $P_{fr}$ (absorbs far-red light).\n\n1.  **Phytochrome Conversion:** During the day (or when exposed to red light), $P_r$ is converted to $P_{fr}$. So at the end of the 8-hour light period, the phytochrome in both plants is predominantly in the $P_{fr}$ form.\n\n2.  **Dark Reversion:** During a continuous period of darkness, $P_{fr}$ slowly reverts back to $P_r$. The plant's biological clock essentially measures how much $P_{fr}$ has reverted to $P_r$. The length of the uninterrupted dark period determines the relative amounts of $P_r$ and $P_{fr}$ at dawn.\n\n3.  **Flowering Signal:**\n    *   In Short-Day Plants (SDPs), a high concentration of $P_{fr}$ at the end of the night is inhibitory to flowering. They require a long, uninterrupted night for $P_{fr}$ to fall below a certain threshold, thus permitting flowering.\n    *   In Long-Day Plants (LDPs), a high concentration of $P_{fr}$ is stimulatory to flowering. They require a short night so that a high level of $P_{fr}$ persists until dawn, triggering flowering.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Experimental Condition:** The total cycle is 8 hours of light and 16 hours of darkness. The 16-hour dark period is interrupted at its midpoint (after 8 hours) by a flash of red light.\n\n5.  **Effect of the Interruption:** The flash of red light rapidly converts the $P_r$ that has accumulated during the first 8 hours of darkness back into the $P_{fr}$ form. This effectively \"resets\" the plant's internal clock. The plant does not perceive a single, continuous 16-hour night. Instead, it perceives two consecutive, shorter dark periods: one 8-hour period before the flash, and one 8-hour period after the flash. For the purpose of flowering control, the longest continuous dark period is 8 hours.\n\n6.  **Outcome for Plant A (SDP):**\n    *   Plant A is an SDP with a critical night length of 11 hours.\n    *   It requires a continuous dark period *longer* than 11 hours to flower.\n    *   Due to the light flash, the longest continuous dark period it experiences is 8 hours.\n    *   Since 8 hours is less than the critical 11 hours, Plant A will **not** flower.\n\n7.  **Outcome for Plant B (LDP):**\n    *   Plant B is an LDP with a critical night length of 13 hours.\n    *   It requires a continuous dark period *shorter* than 13 hours to flower.\n    *   The longest continuous dark period it experiences is 8 hours.\n    *   Since 8 hours is less than the critical 13 hours, Plant B **will** flower.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Plant A will not flower, and Plant B will flower.

This practice [@problem_id:1728111] shifts our focus from the perception of light in the leaves to the plant's systemic response. It explores the concept of the \"florigen\" signal, a stable and mobile messenger that travels to the shoot apex to trigger a long-lasting, often irreversible, commitment to flowering, even after the plant returns to non-inductive conditions.", "problem": "A plant physiologist is studying a species of short-day plant. This type of plant initiates flowering only when the duration of the daily dark period exceeds a specific critical night length. The particular species in this experiment is known to have a critical night length of 11 hours.\n\nThe plant is initially grown from a seedling under a consistent, non-inductive light regime consisting of a 16-hour light period followed by an 8-hour dark period each day. Once the plant is mature and has several fully developed leaves, the physiologist subjects it to a single, carefully controlled inductive cycle: one 8-hour light period followed by one continuous, uninterrupted 16-hour dark period. Immediately following this single long-night treatment, the plant is returned to the original non-inductive regime (16 hours light, 8 hours dark) for the rest of its lifespan.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected outcome for this plant?\n\nA. The plant will not flower because a sustained period of multiple, consecutive long nights is required to induce flowering.\n\nB. The plant will initiate and complete the flowering process because a single, sufficient inductive stimulus triggers a stable, transmissible signal that commits the apical meristems to reproduction.\n\nC. The plant will begin to develop flower buds, but these buds will fail to develop fully and will revert to vegetative shoots because the plant is no longer in an inductive environment.\n\nD. Only the specific leaves that were exposed to the long night will attempt to produce flowers, while the rest of the plant remains vegetative.\n\nE. The plant will not flower because the apical meristem itself must directly perceive the long-night stimulus for flowering to be initiated.", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the photoperiodic requirement. A short-day (long-night) plant flowers only when a single continuous night exceeds its critical night length. The given species has a critical night length of $11$ hours.\n\nStep 2: Classify the initial regime. The plant is initially under a $16$-hour light and $8$-hour dark cycle. Since the dark period is $8<11$ hours, this regime is non-inductive for this short-day plant.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the inductive treatment. The plant then experiences one cycle of $8$ hours light followed by $16$ hours continuous dark. Because the dark period is uninterrupted and $16>11$ hours, this single night is inductive.\n\nStep 4: Determine the site of perception and signal generation. In photoperiodism, the leaves are the sites of light/dark perception (via phytochrome and the circadian system). The problem states the plant has several fully developed leaves at the time of treatment, which enables proper perception and response. Following an inductive night, leaves synthesize a transmissible floral stimulus (florigen, classically associated with FT protein), which is transported via the phloem to the shoot apical meristems.\n\nStep 5: Commitment of the meristem. The florigenic signal commits the apical meristems to reproductive development (floral evocation). This commitment is stable; after evocation, the meristems proceed through floral development even if returned to non-inductive photoperiods. Thus, a single sufficient inductive cycle can initiate and lead to completion of flowering in many short-day plants.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because multiple consecutive long nights are not universally required; a single uninterrupted inductive night can suffice for flowering induction in short-day plants.\n- B is correct: a single sufficient inductive stimulus in the leaves generates a stable, transmissible signal that commits apical meristems, allowing initiation and completion of flowering despite subsequent non-inductive conditions.\n- C is incorrect because once floral evocation occurs, the meristems do not typically revert to vegetative growth simply due to return to non-inductive photoperiods.\n- D is incorrect because flowering is not restricted to regions near leaves that perceived the signal; the florigen moves systemically to apical meristems throughout the plant.\n- E is incorrect because the apical meristem does not need to directly perceive the long night; perception occurs in leaves.\n\nTherefore, the expected outcome is described by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1728111"}]}
