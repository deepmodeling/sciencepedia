{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A plant's ability to bend towards light is a finely tuned process, not a simple reaction to overall brightness. This exercise explores the concept of an action spectrum for phototropism, investigating how different colors, or wavelengths, of light affect the growth response. By comparing the effects of blue, red, and white light, you can deduce the specific molecular machinery, namely the phototropin photoreceptors, responsible for initiating this directional growth [@problem_id:1729117].", "problem": "A plant physiologist is investigating the phototropic response in etiolated maize (Zea mays) coleoptiles. An intact coleoptile is placed in a completely dark, temperature- and humidity-controlled chamber, oriented vertically. A narrow beam of monochromatic light can be directed horizontally at one side of the coleoptile, targeting the region just below its apex. The experiment is designed to measure the angle of curvature of the coleoptile relative to its initial vertical orientation after a fixed duration of illumination.\n\nFour separate, identical experiments are conducted, each using a different illumination condition:\n\n1.  **Condition A:** Unilateral illumination with blue light at a wavelength of $450$ nm.\n2.  **Condition B:** Unilateral illumination with red light at a wavelength of $660$ nm.\n3.  **Condition C:** The coleoptile is maintained in complete darkness for the duration of the experiment.\n4.  **Condition D:** Unilateral illumination with a broad-spectrum white light.\n\nAssume that the light intensity (fluence rate) for each condition is adjusted to be physiologically effective for any potential response, and the experimental duration is sufficient for a measurable tropic response to develop.\n\nBased on the known molecular mechanisms of phototropism in higher plants, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the relative outcomes of these experiments?\n\nA. Condition B will produce the largest angle of curvature, significantly greater than the curvature produced in Condition A.\n\nB. Conditions A and D will result in significant curvature towards the light source, while Conditions B and C will result in negligible curvature.\n\nC. All conditions involving light (A, B, and D) will result in significant and approximately equal angles of curvature towards the light source.\n\nD. Condition D will result in the largest curvature, followed by Condition B, and then Condition A, with Condition C showing no curvature.\n\nE. Conditions A and D will result in curvature towards the light source, while Condition B will result in significant curvature away from the light source.", "solution": "Phototropism in coleoptiles is a positive curvature towards unilateral light driven by blue-light photoreceptors, primarily phototropins (phot1 and phot2). The experimentally established action spectrum for shoot phototropism peaks in the blue region near a wavelength of approximately $450$ nm, indicating maximal sensitivity to blue light and negligible sensitivity to red light for eliciting phototropic curvature.\n\nThe mechanistic basis involves unilateral blue-light perception at the coleoptile tip, which triggers asymmetric auxin distribution via relocalization of auxin transporters, producing higher auxin concentration on the shaded side. This yields differential elongation rates such that the shaded side grows faster than the illuminated side, i.e., $r_{\\text{shaded}} > r_{\\text{lit}}$, producing curvature towards the light source. In the absence of a directional light cue, auxin distribution remains symmetric and elongation rates are equal, $r_{\\text{shaded}} = r_{\\text{lit}}$, so no net curvature develops.\n\nApplying these principles to the conditions:\n- Condition A (unilateral blue, $450$ nm): Strong activation of phototropins produces significant curvature towards the light via the auxin-mediated mechanism described.\n- Condition B (unilateral red, $660$ nm): Red light is perceived primarily by phytochromes, which regulate processes such as germination and shade avoidance but do not effectively drive the phototropic response in coleoptiles; unilateral red alone produces negligible phototropic curvature under standard conditions.\n- Condition C (dark): No directional cue, so no asymmetric auxin distribution and negligible curvature.\n- Condition D (unilateral white light): White light contains blue wavelengths; thus phototropins are activated and significant curvature towards the light occurs, comparable to that in Condition A when intensities are adjusted to be physiologically effective.\n\nEvaluating the options, the only statement consistent with the known action spectrum and mechanism is that Conditions A and D produce significant curvature towards the light, while Conditions B and C produce negligible curvature. Therefore, the correct choice is B. Other options are incorrect because they either overstate red-light efficacy for phototropism (A, D), claim equal curvature for all light qualities (C), or assert red-induced curvature away from the light (E), which is not supported for coleoptiles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1729117"}, {"introduction": "Just as plants are selective about the light they respond to, they have a specialized mechanism for sensing gravity's constant pull. This problem delves into the cellular basis of gravitropism using a hypothetical genetic mutant to probe the function of statoliths—the dense organelles that act as the plant's internal plumb line [@problem_id:1729088]. By decoupling the statoliths' position from the actual gravity vector, you are challenged to reason from the fundamental signaling event to the root's ultimate growth direction.", "problem": "An agronomist is studying a genetically engineered variant of a plant species. The roots of the wild-type version of this plant exhibit standard positive gravitropism (growing in the direction of gravity) and negative phototropism (growing away from a light source). This behavior is mediated by the hormone auxin; in the root, a higher concentration of auxin inhibits cell elongation. In the specialized gravity-sensing cells of the root cap, called statocytes, dense organelles known as statoliths settle under the influence of gravity, triggering a downstream signal that leads to the accumulation of auxin on the lower side of the root.\n\nIn the mutant variant, however, a peculiar mutation affects the statocytes. The statoliths are permanently adhered to one specific side of each statocyte's cytoplasm, irrespective of the root's orientation relative to the gravitational field. This permanent localization generates a constant internal signal that mimics a strong gravitational pull from that specific side, leading to a persistent accumulation of auxin. The strength of the growth response induced by this internal signal is significantly stronger than any phototropic response the root can mount.\n\nAn experiment is set up in a dark room. A seedling of this mutant plant is oriented such that its root initially grows horizontally along the positive x-axis. As a frame of reference, gravity acts in the negative z-direction. The mutation in this specific seedling causes the statoliths to be fixed to the side of the statocytes corresponding to the negative y-direction. After a period of straight horizontal growth, a light source is switched on directly beneath the setup, illuminating the root uniformly from the negative z-direction.\n\nBased on the provided information, which of the following options best describes the direction of the root's subsequent growth bend?\n\nA. Towards the +z direction (upwards)\n\nB. Towards the -z direction (downwards)\n\nC. Towards the -y direction\n\nD. Towards the +y direction\n\nE. The root will continue to grow straight along the +x axis", "solution": "Define the coordinate system as given: the root initially extends along $+x$, gravity acts along $-z$, and the mutant statoliths are fixed on the $-y$ side of each statocyte.\n\nPrinciples:\n1) In roots, auxin inhibits cell elongation. If $A$ denotes auxin concentration and $r$ the local elongation rate, then $\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial A} < 0$. A linear inhibitory relation can be represented as $r=r_{0}-kA$ with $k>0$.\n2) Gravitropic sensing in roots leads to auxin accumulation on the side interpreted as “down.” Bending direction in roots is toward the side with higher auxin (because that side elongates less and becomes the shorter side).\n\nMutant gravitropic signal:\n- Because statoliths are fixed to the $-y$ side, the statocytes constantly signal as if “down” were $-y$, independent of actual gravity along $-z$.\n- Therefore, auxin accumulates on the $-y$ side: let $A_{-y} > A_{+y}$.\n- Using $r=r_{0}-kA$, we have $r_{-y}=r_{0}-kA_{-y}$ and $r_{+y}=r_{0}-kA_{+y}$, so $A_{-y} > A_{+y} \\implies r_{-y} < r_{+y}$.\n- Differential growth causes curvature toward the side with smaller elongation (the shorter side): hence the root bends toward $-y$.\n\nPhototropic signal:\n- Light is applied uniformly from $-z$. Roots are negatively phototropic: auxin redistributes toward the shaded side ($+z$), so $A_{+z} > A_{-z}$, which inhibits elongation on $+z$ and would, in isolation, bend the root away from the light (toward $+z$).\n- However, the problem states the internal statolith-induced signal is significantly stronger than any phototropic response the root can mount. Therefore, the phototropic contribution along $z$ cannot overcome or redirect the dominant gravitropic-like signal along $y$.\n\nConclusion:\n- The dominant auxin asymmetry is $A_{-y} > A_{+y}$, yielding $r_{-y} < r_{+y}$ and bending toward $-y$.\n- Thus, the subsequent growth bend is toward the $-y$ direction.\n\nHence, the correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1729088"}, {"introduction": "In their natural environment, plants must constantly integrate multiple, sometimes conflicting, directional cues. This final practice places you in a scenario where the drive to grow towards light (phototropism) is set in direct opposition to the drive to respond to gravity (gravitropism) [@problem_id:1729157]. Predicting the outcome requires synthesizing your understanding of both tropisms and considering the established hierarchy of these responses in different plant organs, a key principle in plant physiology.", "problem": "An experimental botanist is investigating the mechanisms of plant growth regulation. A single seed of a typical terrestrial plant is sown in a pot filled with a suitable growth medium. The pot itself is made of an opaque material, but its base is perfectly transparent. The entire apparatus is placed within a controlled environment chamber that is completely dark, ensuring no stray light. The only illumination provided is from a uniform light source placed directly beneath the transparent base of the pot, shining light vertically upwards through the soil. The experiment is conducted on Earth, where the acceleration due to gravity, $g$, is directed downwards.\n\nBased on the established principles of phototropism and gravitropism in higher plants, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the dominant direction of growth for the primary shoot and the primary root after the seed has germinated and growth has proceeded for several days?\n\nA. The shoot will grow upwards, away from the light source, while the root will grow downwards, towards the light source.\n\nB. The shoot will grow downwards, towards the light source, while the root will grow downwards, following the direction of gravity.\n\nC. Both the shoot and the root will grow downwards, towards the light source, with gravity having a negligible effect.\n\nD. The shoot will grow upwards, against gravity, while the root will grow upwards, away from the light source.\n\nE.

Let the gravitational acceleration vector be $\\vec{g}$ directed downward. The light source is placed beneath the pot and shines upward through the soil; the light source itself is below, so “toward the light source” means downward.\n\nPrinciples:\n- Shoots exhibit positive phototropism (growth toward the light source) and negative gravitropism (growth opposite to $\\vec{g}$).\n- Roots exhibit negative phototropism (growth away from the light source) and positive gravitropism (growth along $\\vec{g}$).\n- When phototropic and gravitropic cues conflict, the typical dominance is that phototropism dominates in shoots, while gravitropism dominates in roots.\n\nApply to the setup:\n1. For the shoot: The light source is below, so positive phototropism favors growth downward (toward the source). Negative gravitropism favors growth upward (opposite $\\vec{g}$). Under conflicting cues, phototropism generally dominates in shoots; therefore, the shoot grows downward, toward the light source.\n2.

Under conflicting cues, gravitropism generally dominates in roots; therefore, the root grows downward, along $\\vec{g}$.\n\nThus, the shoot grows downward toward the light source, and the root grows downward with gravity, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1729157"}]}
