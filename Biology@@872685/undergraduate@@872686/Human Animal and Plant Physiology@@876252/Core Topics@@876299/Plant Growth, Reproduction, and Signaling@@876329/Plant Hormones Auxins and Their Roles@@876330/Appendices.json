This practice explores the core of auxin perception by challenging you to predict the physical appearance of a plant with a non-functional auxin receptor [@problem_id:1732578]. By thinking through the consequences of this molecular breakdown, you can connect the signaling pathway directly to the whole-plant form and function.", "problem": "In vascular plants, the hormone auxin plays a central role in regulating growth and development. The canonical signaling pathway for auxin involves its perception by a receptor complex. A key component of this receptor is the Transport Inhibitor Response 1 (TIR1) protein, which is part of an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. In the presence of auxin, the SCF-TIR1 complex targets transcriptional repressor proteins known as Aux/IAA for degradation. This degradation liberates Auxin Response Factor (ARF) transcription factors, which can then activate the expression of auxin-responsive genes, leading to various developmental outcomes such as cell elongation, apical dominance, and lateral root formation.\n\nConsider a hypothetical mutant plant line that possesses a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the TIR1 protein. This mutation renders the TIR1 protein completely non-functional, making it unable to bind auxin or participate in the degradation of Aux/IAA repressors. Assuming all other cellular machinery, including the synthesis of auxin and all other signaling components, is normal, which of the following descriptions most accurately predicts the overall phenotype of this mutant plant compared to a wild-type plant?\n\nA. The plant exhibits profound dwarfism, a highly branched or \"bushy\" architecture due to a lack of apical dominance, and a severely reduced number of lateral roots.\n\nB. The plant displays exaggerated height due to enhanced cell elongation, a single unbranched primary stem due to strong apical dominance, and an overproduction of adventitious roots along the stem.\n\nC. The plant grows to a normal height but fails to produce any lateral branches, exhibiting extreme apical dominance, and shows a normal response to gravitational stimuli.\n\nD. The plant is a dwarf but develops a very dense and extensive lateral root system, while maintaining a normal, single-stem growth habit characteristic of strong apical dominance.\n\nE. The plant exhibits a normal shoot architecture and height, but its roots completely fail to respond to gravity, and its leaves are prematurely senescent and yellow.", "solution": "We first restate the canonical auxin signaling mechanism. Auxin is perceived by the SCF-TIR1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where TIR1 functions as the F-box receptor component. In the presence of auxin, TIR1 binds Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors, targeting them for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. The degradation of Aux/IAA releases Auxin Response Factors (ARFs) from repression, allowing ARFs to activate auxin-responsive genes. These gene programs promote processes such as cell elongation, maintenance of apical dominance, and lateral root initiation.\n\nNext, we consider the stated mutation: a complete loss of function in TIR1 such that TIR1 cannot bind auxin or promote Aux/IAA degradation. Given this, the immediate mechanistic consequence is the constitutive stabilization of Aux/IAA repressors. Because Aux/IAA proteins remain undegraded, ARFs remain repressed, and auxin-responsive gene expression is strongly diminished or abolished, despite normal auxin levels and otherwise intact cellular machinery.\n\nFrom this signaling block, we predict the following physiological outcomes:\n1. Cell elongation: Auxin promotes cell elongation via ARF-dependent induction of gene sets such as SAURs, GH3s, and expansins. With ARFs repressed, these pathways are not activated, leading to severely reduced cell elongation and thus dwarfism.\n2. Apical dominance: In wild-type plants, auxin produced by the shoot apex maintains apical dominance, suppressing lateral bud outgrowth through auxin-responsive signaling. If auxin signaling is blocked upstream at TIR1, the apex cannot exert its normal suppressive effect via ARF activation. This results in loss of apical dominance and a highly branched, bushy architecture.\n3. Lateral root formation: Auxin is essential for lateral root initiation and emergence, notably through ARF-dependent transcriptional activation of downstream regulators in pericycle cells. With Aux/IAA repressors not degraded, ARFs cannot induce lateral root programs, resulting in a severely reduced number of lateral roots.\n\nOther auxin-dependent processes such as tropic responses may also be compromised, but among the provided options, the combination of dwarfism, loss of apical dominance, and reduced lateral roots is the most direct and comprehensive consequence of abolishing TIR1-mediated auxin perception and signaling. Therefore, the description that best matches these mechanistic predictions is a plant that is profoundly dwarfed, bushy due to lack of apical dominance, and has a greatly reduced lateral root system.\n\nHence, option A is the most accurate prediction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1732578"}, {"introduction": "A hormone's message is only effective if it can be delivered to the right place. This exercise delves into the critical process of polar auxin transport, the plant's directional delivery system for this key hormone [@problem_id:1732591]. You will analyze a scenario where this transport is chemically blocked, allowing you to deduce the large-scale consequences of disrupting this vital flow.", "problem": "In vascular plants, the hormone auxin is essential for regulating growth and development. It is primarily synthesized in the shoot apical meristem and young leaves. From these sources, it is actively transported down the stem in a unidirectional process known as polar auxin transport. A primary function of this downward-flowing auxin is to stimulate the elongation of stem cells.\n\nAn experiment is performed on a young, actively growing pea plant. A small ring of lanolin paste containing N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), a chemical that specifically inhibits polar auxin transport, is carefully applied around the plant's main stem, midway between the apex and the ground. The plant is then allowed to grow for another week under ideal conditions.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the changes in auxin concentration and resulting stem growth in the regions immediately above and immediately below the NPA-treated ring, relative to a normal, untreated plant?\n\nA. Above the ring: Decreased auxin concentration and inhibited growth. Below the ring: Increased auxin concentration and stimulated growth.\n\nB. Above the ring: Increased auxin concentration and stimulated growth. Below the ring: Decreased auxin concentration and inhibited growth.\n\nC. Both above and below the ring: Decreased auxin concentration and inhibited growth.\n\nD. Above the ring: No change in auxin concentration, but inhibited growth. Below the ring: Decreased auxin concentration and inhibited growth.\n\nE. Both above and below the ring: No significant change in auxin concentration or growth, as the primary effect of NPA is to inhibit root development.", "solution": "Auxin in stems is synthesized primarily in the shoot apical meristem and young leaves and is transported basipetally (from apex downward) via carrier-mediated polar transport. Let $J$ denote the basipetal auxin flux in a normal stem and let $C_{\\text{above}}$ and $C_{\\text{below}}$ denote the auxin concentrations immediately above and below a position on the stem, respectively. In an untreated plant at steady state, $J>0$ and there is continuous supply of auxin from the apex to lower regions, maintaining $C_{\\text{below}}$ relative to local degradation and diffusion.\n\nN-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) specifically inhibits the efflux carriers (e.g., PIN proteins) that mediate polar auxin transport. Applying an NPA-containing lanolin ring around the stem establishes a barrier to basipetal transport at that position. This sets the net basipetal flux across the ring to approximately zero, i.e., $J_{\\text{across ring}} \\approx 0$.\n\nImmediately above the ring, auxin continues to be synthesized at the apex and transported basipetally until it encounters the blocked interface. Because outflow across the ring is inhibited, the effective efflux from this compartment is reduced. A mass-balance description can be conceptualized as\n$$\n\\frac{dC_{\\text{above}}}{dt} = S_{\\text{apex}} - k_{\\text{local}} C_{\\text{above}} - J_{\\text{across ring}},\n$$\nwith $J_{\\text{across ring}} \\approx 0$ under NPA, so relative to the untreated condition (where $J_{\\text{across ring}}=J>0$), $C_{\\text{above}}$ increases. In shoots, increased auxin concentration stimulates cell elongation; therefore growth above the ring is stimulated.\n\nImmediately below the ring, the principal supply from the apex is cut off. A corresponding balance is\n$$\n\\frac{dC_{\\text{below}}}{dt} = J_{\\text{across ring}} - k_{\\text{decay}} C_{\\text{below}} + S_{\\text{local}},\n$$\nand with $J_{\\text{across ring}} \\approx 0$ and negligible local auxin synthesis in the lower stem compared to the apex (i.e., $S_{\\text{local}}$ small), $C_{\\text{below}}$ decreases relative to the untreated plant. Auxin promotes stem elongation, so reduced auxin leads to inhibited growth below the ring.\n\nTherefore, relative to a normal plant, auxin accumulates and growth is stimulated above the NPA ring, while auxin decreases and growth is inhibited below it.

This problem asks you to explain why a shoot grows up and a root grows down, even though auxin accumulates on the lower side of both [@problem_id:1732614]. Solving this puzzle requires understanding the crucial concept of differential sensitivity, where different tissues can respond in dramatically different ways to the same hormonal signal.", "problem": "In a typical terrestrial plant, when a seedling is oriented horizontally, the shoot exhibits negative gravitropism (grows upward, against gravity) and the root exhibits positive gravitropism (grows downward, with gravity). The Cholodny-Went hypothesis correctly posits that this differential growth is primarily mediated by the plant hormone auxin. In a horizontal orientation, gravity causes auxin to accumulate at a higher concentration on the lower side of both the shoot and the root compared to their respective upper sides.\n\nDespite the fact that auxin accumulates on the lower side in both organs, the shoot bends up while the root bends down. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate explanation for this observed phenomenon?\n\nA. Root cells are significantly more sensitive to auxin than shoot cells, and the high concentration of auxin that accumulates on the lower side of the root is supraoptimal, inhibiting cell elongation. In contrast, this same concentration range promotes cell elongation in the shoot.\n\nB. Auxin promotes cell elongation in shoots but universally inhibits cell elongation in roots, regardless of its concentration. The presence of auxin on the lower side of the root simply halts its growth, allowing the upper side to continue growing nominally.\n\nC. In roots, the gravity-sensing mechanism is inverted, causing auxin to accumulate on the upper side, which promotes cell elongation there, while the lower side with less auxin elongates less, causing a downward curve.\n\nD. While auxin controls the shoot's response, the root's gravitropic response is primarily controlled by a different hormone, abscisic acid, which accumulates on the lower side of the root and inhibits cell elongation.\n\nE. The high concentration of auxin on the lower side of the root stimulates rapid cell division, rather than elongation, leading to a thickening of the root that forces it to bend downward. In the shoot, auxin stimulates cell elongation.", "solution": "According to the Cholodny-Went hypothesis, in a horizontally oriented seedling, gravity causes auxin to redistribute such that the concentration on the lower side is greater than on the upper side in both the shoot and the root. Denote auxin concentration on the lower and upper sides as $C_{\\text{lower}}$ and $C_{\\text{upper}}$, respectively, with\n$$\nC_{\\text{lower}} > C_{\\text{upper}}.\n$$\n\nLet the elongation rate be a function of auxin concentration, with $g_{\\text{shoot}} = f_{\\text{shoot}}(C)$ for shoots and $g_{\\text{root}} = f_{\\text{root}}(C)$ for roots. Empirically:\n- In shoots, within the relevant physiological range, auxin promotes cell elongation, so $f_{\\text{shoot}}(C)$ increases with $C$.\n- In roots, cells are more sensitive to auxin, and the response is biphasic with a low optimal concentration; beyond this, higher auxin inhibits elongation. Thus, for the elevated concentrations produced by gravitropic redistribution, $f_{\\text{root}}(C)$ decreases with $C$ in the supraoptimal range.\n\nTherefore:\n- Shoot: $C_{\\text{lower}} > C_{\\text{upper}} \\implies g_{\\text{shoot}}(C_{\\text{lower}}) > g_{\\text{shoot}}(C_{\\text{upper}})$, so the lower side elongates more, causing the shoot to bend upward (negative gravitropism).\n- Root: $C_{\\text{lower}} > C_{\\text{upper}}$ but in the inhibitory range, so $g_{\\text{root}}(C_{\\text{lower}}) < g_{\\text{root}}(C_{\\text{upper}})$, meaning the lower side elongates less and the upper side elongates more, producing a downward bend (positive gravitropism).\n\nThis pattern matches the statement that root cells are more sensitive to auxin and that higher auxin on the lower side of the root is supraoptimal and inhibits elongation, while the same concentration range promotes elongation in the shoot. This is precisely option A.\n\nThe remaining options are inconsistent with established physiology: B incorrectly claims auxin universally inhibits root elongation regardless of concentration; C contradicts the observed redistribution by claiming auxin accumulates on the upper side of roots; D incorrectly assigns primary control of root gravitropism to abscisic acid rather than auxin; E incorrectly attributes curvature to differential cell division rather than differential elongation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1732614"}]}
