Your task is to use this logic to predict the growth of plants with different mutations in the gibberellin synthesis pathway [@problem_id:1733393].", "problem": "Plant height is significantly influenced by a class of hormones known as Gibberellins (GAs). In a particular plant species, a simplified version of the biosynthetic pathway leading to the biologically active GA that promotes stem elongation is understood to be a linear sequence of reactions. The sequence is as follows:\n\n$$ \\text{Metabolic Precursor} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Enzyme 1}} GA_{12} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Enzyme 2}} GA_{9} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Enzyme 3}} GA_{4} \\text{ (Active Form)} $$\n\nThe final product, $GA_4$, is the active hormone that directly stimulates the cells in the stem to elongate, resulting in a tall plant.

The gibberellin pathway relies on a clever \"double negative\" mechanism: the hormone triggers the destruction of a protein that represses growth. This practice challenges you to think about what happens when a key part of this signaling machinery is broken. By analyzing a transgenic plant with a permanently stable repressor protein, you'll deepen your understanding of how signaling pathways are switched on and off [@problem_id:1733347].", "problem": "In many higher plants, the hormone Gibberellin (GA) plays a crucial role in regulating growth and development, including processes like seed germination and stem elongation. The signaling pathway for GA is well-characterized. In the absence of GA, a class of nuclear proteins known as DELLA proteins act as repressors, binding to transcription factors and preventing the expression of growth-promoting genes. This results in inhibited growth. When GA is present, it binds to its soluble receptor, GID1. This GA-GID1 complex then binds to a DELLA protein, triggering the DELLA protein to be targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. The destruction of the DELLA repressor protein liberates the transcription factors, allowing them to activate the expression of growth-related genes, and an increase in growth is observed.\n\nA plant geneticist develops a transgenic plant line that expresses a stable, modified version of a DELLA protein. This modified DELLA protein retains its ability to repress transcription factors, and it can still be bound by the GA-GID1 complex, but it has been altered in such a way that it can no longer be ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome.\n\nWhich of the following descriptions most accurately predicts the observable phenotype of this transgenic plant, especially when it is sprayed with a solution containing a high concentration of gibberellin?\n\nA. The plant will exhibit a severe dwarf phenotype and will not show a growth response to the applied gibberellin.\nB. The plant will have a phenotype identical to a wild-type plant, showing normal growth and a normal response to applied gibberellin.\nC. The plant will exhibit a tall and spindly phenotype, characteristic of plants with excessive gibberellin signaling.\nD. The plant will initially be a dwarf but will grow to a normal height after the application of gibberellin, as the high concentration of the hormone will overcome the repression.\nE. The plant will die during the seedling stage because essential metabolic processes are permanently shut down.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the phenotype of a transgenic plant with a modified DELLA protein that cannot be degraded. To solve this, we must analyze the effect of this mutation on the gibberellin (GA) signaling pathway.\n\nStep 1: Understand the normal GA signaling pathway.\n- In the absence of GA, DELLA proteins are stable and active.\n- Active DELLA proteins repress growth by inhibiting transcription factors necessary for the expression of growth-promoting genes. The default state is therefore repressed growth.\n- When GA is present, it binds to its receptor, GID1.\n- The GA-GID1 complex binds to a DELLA protein.\n- This binding event marks the DELLA protein for degradation by the cell's protein disposal machinery (the 26S proteasome).\n- The destruction of the DELLA repressor removes the block on growth-promoting genes, leading to plant growth (e.g., stem elongation).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the specific mutation in the transgenic plant.\n- The plant expresses a modified DELLA protein that cannot be degraded by the proteasome.\n- This modified DELLA protein is still functional as a growth repressor.\n- This means that even when GA is present and binds to GID1, and the resulting complex binds to the DELLA protein, the final and crucial step of the pathway—the degradation of DELLA—is blocked.\n\nStep 3: Deduce the molecular consequences.\n- Since the DELLA protein cannot be degraded, it will remain present and active in the nucleus, regardless of the concentration of GA in the plant's tissues.\n- An active DELLA protein constantly represses the transcription of growth-promoting genes.\n- This condition is a state of constitutive (permanent) repression of the GA growth response. The cell is unable to respond to the GA signal because the repressor cannot be removed.\n\nStep 4: Predict the whole-plant phenotype.\n- The continuous repression of growth-promoting genes will lead to a significant reduction in growth processes that are regulated by GA, such as stem elongation.\n- This will result in a plant with a dwarf phenotype.\n- Because the block in the signaling pathway occurs downstream of GA perception (i.e., the repressor itself is invulnerable), applying external GA will not alleviate the repression. The plant will be insensitive to GA.\n- Therefore, even when sprayed with high concentrations of GA, the plant will remain a dwarf.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. The plant will exhibit a severe dwarf phenotype and will not show a growth response to the applied gibberellin. This perfectly matches our deduction. The constitutive activity of the DELLA repressor causes dwarfism, and the inability to degrade it causes GA insensitivity.\n- B. The plant will have a phenotype identical to a wild-type plant, showing normal growth and a normal response to applied gibberellin. This is incorrect. The mutation fundamentally breaks the signaling pathway.\n- C. The plant will exhibit a tall and spindly phenotype, characteristic of plants with excessive gibberellin signaling. This is the opposite of the expected outcome. A tall phenotype would result from a lack of DELLA protein or a hyperactive GA pathway.\n- D. The plant will initially be a dwarf but will grow to a normal height after the application of gibberellin. This is incorrect. It suggests that high GA levels can overcome the repressor by some other means, but the mechanism of action—degradation—is explicitly blocked. Thus, the plant is GA-insensitive, not just less sensitive.\n- E. The plant will die during the seedling stage. While severe dwarfism might reduce fitness, DELLA proteins are primarily growth regulators, not controllers of essential central metabolism. Plants with this mutation are viable, though severely dwarfed. Thus, lethality is not the most accurate prediction.\n\nConclusion: The most accurate prediction is that the plant will be a GA-insensitive dwarf.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1733347"}, {"introduction": "Biological pathways are networks of interacting components. A powerful way to understand these networks is to study what happens when multiple parts are disabled at once, a concept known as genetic epistasis. This exercise asks you to predict the phenotype of a plant with mutations in two different genes in the gibberellin signaling cascade. Solving this puzzle requires you to integrate your knowledge of the pathway and determine which mutation has the final say in controlling the plant's growth and development [@problem_id:1733386].", "problem": "In plant biology, growth and development are tightly regulated by hormones. One such crucial hormone is Gibberellic Acid (GA), which plays a key role in promoting stem elongation and ensuring fertility. The cellular signaling pathway for GA involves several key protein components.\n\n- **Gibberellic Acid (GA):** A hormone that, when present at sufficient levels, stimulates gene expression leading to cell division and expansion in stems, and proper reproductive organ development.\n- **GID1:** A soluble intracellular protein that functions as the GA receptor. For the GA signal to be transduced, the hormone must first bind to a functional GID1 protein.\n- **DELLA proteins:** A family of nuclear proteins that act as master repressors of GA-responsive genes. When DELLA proteins are active and bound to the DNA, they block the transcription of genes responsible for stem elongation and fertility.\n\nAn agricultural scientist is investigating this pathway in a crop species. Through genetic engineering, the scientist creates a double mutant plant line. This line is homozygous for a complete loss-of-function allele of the gene encoding the GID1 receptor (the `gid1` mutant) and is also homozygous for a complete loss-of-function allele of the gene encoding a critical DELLA protein (the `della` mutant).\n\nBased on the fundamental roles of these proteins as described, which of the following phenotypes is the `gid1 della` double mutant plant most likely to exhibit when compared to a wild-type plant of the same species grown under identical, optimal conditions?\n\nA. Severe dwarfism with complete sterility.\nB. Tall and slender with normal fertility.\nC. Indistinguishable from the wild-type in height and fertility.\nD. Severe dwarfism with normal fertility.\nE. Wild-type height with complete sterility.", "solution": "The GA pathway described operates as follows:\n1) In wild type, GA must bind a functional GID1 receptor to form the GA–GID1 complex. This complex promotes the inactivation and proteasomal degradation of DELLA proteins. Because DELLA proteins are transcriptional repressors of GA-responsive genes, their removal derepresses those genes, leading to stem elongation and normal fertility.\n\n2) Define logical variables for pathway function: let $R=1$ if GID1 is functional and $R=0$ if it is not; let $D=1$ if the DELLA repressor is present and functional and $D=0$ if it is not; and let $T$ denote the transcriptional state of GA-responsive genes that promote elongation and fertility, with $T=\\text{ON}$ if they are expressed and $T=\\text{OFF}$ if repressed.\n- Mechanistically, in the presence of GA, a functional receptor ($R=1$) triggers DELLA inactivation, effectively setting the repressor state to inactive (functionally equivalent to $D=0$ at the level of target gene regulation). This yields $T=\\text{ON}$, producing elongation and fertility.\n- If the receptor is nonfunctional ($R=0$), GA cannot be perceived, so DELLA remains active if present ($D=1$), giving $T=\\text{OFF}$, which yields dwarfism and sterility.\n- If DELLA is absent or nonfunctional ($D=0$), repression is lifted irrespective of receptor or hormone status, so $T=\\text{ON}$ and the plant exhibits elongation and fertility.\n\n3) Apply this to single mutants:\n- gid1 loss-of-function: $R=0$ with $D=1$ in otherwise wild-type DELLA. DELLA remains active; thus $T=\\text{OFF}$, leading to severe dwarfism and sterility.\n- della loss-of-function: $D=0$; regardless of $R$ or GA, repression is removed; thus $T=\\text{ON}$, leading to tall growth and normal fertility (constitutive GA response).\n\n4) For the gid1 della double mutant: $R=0$ and $D=0$. Because DELLA, the downstream repressor, is absent, there is no repression regardless of the upstream receptor state. Therefore $T=\\text{ON}$ and the phenotype is tall and slender with normal fertility. In epistasis terms, the loss of the downstream negative regulator (DELLA) is epistatic to the loss of the upstream receptor (GID1) and yields a constitutive-response phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the most likely phenotype is tall and slender with normal fertility.\n\nNo mistakes are identified in the problem statement; the provided roles of GA, GID1, and DELLA are consistent with canonical GA signaling.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1733386"}]}
