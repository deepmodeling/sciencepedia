This fundamental distinction between slowly adapting (tonic) and rapidly adapting (phasic) receptors is crucial for how the nervous system encodes different features of our environment. This practice [@problem_id:1741290] challenges you to apply these concepts to predict the distinct electrical signatures of two key mechanoreceptors found in human skin.", "problem": "A researcher is investigating the properties of two distinct types of mechanoreceptors in the glabrous (hairless) skin of a fingertip: the Merkel's disc, which is a slowly adapting receptor, and the Meissner's corpuscle, which is a rapidly adapting receptor. To contrast their behaviors, a small, blunt probe is used to apply a constant indentation to the skin. The stimulus begins at time $t=0$ and is maintained at a constant depth for a duration $T$, where $T$ is a few seconds. At time $t=T$, the probe is rapidly withdrawn.\n\nThe researcher measures the receptor potential of the sensory neuron associated with each receptor type. A receptor potential is a graded change in the neuron's membrane voltage from its resting state.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected receptor potential profiles for both the Merkel's disc and the Meissner's corpuscle in response to this sustained stimulus?\n\nA. Merkel's disc: The receptor potential depolarizes at $t=0$ and remains significantly depolarized for the entire duration from $t=0$ to $t=T$, before returning to the resting state after $t=T$. Meissner's corpuscle: The receptor potential depolarizes transiently at $t=0$, returns to the resting state shortly after, and shows another transient potential change at $t=T$ when the stimulus is removed.\n\nB. Merkel's disc: The receptor potential depolarizes transiently at $t=0$, returns to the resting state shortly after, and shows another transient potential change at $t=T$ when the stimulus is removed.

Both the Merkel's disc and the Meissner's corpuscle show a receptor potential that depolarizes transiently at $t=0$, returns to the resting state shortly after, and shows another transient potential change at $t=T$ when the stimulus is removed.\n\nE. Merkel's disc: The receptor potential shows a single, transient depolarization only at $t=0$ and is unresponsive to the removal of the stimulus at $t=T$. Meissner's corpuscle: The receptor potential shows no response at $t=0$ but shows a transient depolarization only at $t=T$ when the stimulus is removed.", "solution": "1) Identify receptor types and their adaptation properties. Merkel's discs are slowly adapting (SA) mechanoreceptors, meaning their receptor potential during a sustained, constant stimulus remains elevated above baseline for the duration of the stimulus, reflecting static skin deformation. Meissner's corpuscles are rapidly adapting (RA) mechanoreceptors, meaning their receptor potential primarily encodes changes in stimulus (onset and offset) and returns to near resting potential during a constant, unchanging stimulus.\n\n2) Apply the mechanotransduction principle for SA and RA receptors to a step indentation. The stimulus is a step input starting at $t=0$ and maintained constant until $t=T$, then rapidly removed. For SA receptors (Merkel), the receptor potential shows an initial dynamic component at $t=0$ followed by a sustained depolarization during $0<t<T$, and then a return to baseline after $t=T$ when the indentation is removed. For RA receptors (Meissner), the receptor potential exhibits a transient depolarization at the onset $t=0$, adapts back toward baseline during $0<t<T$ despite continued indentation, and then exhibits another transient change at $t=T$ upon stimulus removal.\n\n3) Map these expected profiles to the provided statements. Statement A describes: Merkel’s disc depolarizes at $t=0$ and remains significantly depolarized for $0<t<T$, returning to resting after $t=T$; Meissner’s corpuscle shows transient responses at $t=0$ and $t=T$ with baseline in between. This matches the established SA versus RA behavior.\n\n4) Exclude alternatives by contradiction with known physiology. Statement B reverses SA and RA roles; Statement C incorrectly claims sustained depolarization for both; Statement D incorrectly assigns RA-like dynamics to both; Statement E contradicts known onset sensitivity of both RA and SA receptors and ignores offset sensitivity of RA receptors.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1741290"}, {"introduction": "How does an influx of ions across a membrane translate into a specific, graded change in voltage?

In its resting state, the cell maintains a stable membrane potential. This potential is primarily determined by the flow of potassium ions ($K^+$) through leak channels and a small, constant background influx of sodium ions ($Na^+$). When a salty solution is applied to the tongue, taste receptor cells are exposed to a high concentration of $Na^+$, which then flows into the cell through a specific class of channels called Epithelial Sodium Channels (ENaCs), causing the cell to depolarize.

The closure of cGMP-gated cation channels subsequently causes the cell membrane to hyperpolarize. The recovery of the cell to its dark-adapted state is limited by the resynthesis of cGMP.\n\nConsider a simplified biophysical model for this recovery process. After a brief, intense flash of light at time $t=0$, the intracellular cGMP concentration, denoted as $[C](t)$, is effectively reduced to zero. For $t > 0$, the evolution of $[C](t)$ is governed by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d[C]}{dt} = V_s - k_{hyd} [C]\n$$\nHere, $V_s$ is the constant rate of cGMP synthesis by guanylate cyclase, and $k_{hyd}$ is the pseudo-first-order rate constant for cGMP hydrolysis by a basal activity of the enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE).\n\nNow, suppose the cell is treated with a specific competitive inhibitor of PDE. The inhibitor is present at a constant concentration $[I]$ and has an inhibition constant $K_I$. In the uninhibited cell, the hydrolysis rate constant is $k$. Due to competitive inhibition, the effective hydrolysis rate constant is reduced in the presence of the inhibitor.\n\nThe membrane potential's deviation from the dark resting potential (i.e., the hyperpolarization) is proportional to the reduction in the inward \"dark current\".
