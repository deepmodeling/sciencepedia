This initial practice focuses on spermatogenesis and the crucial event of Meiosis I, the reductional division. By tracking the number of chromosomes and chromatids, you will solidify your understanding of how a diploid cell is precisely converted into haploid cells, a cornerstone of sexual reproduction. [@problem_id:1708251]", "problem": "In a particular species of mammal, somatic cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle are diploid and contain 24 chromosomes ($2n = 24$). A researcher is studying spermatogenesis in a male from this species. A single primary spermatocyte, after completing the S phase of interphase, enters meiosis. This cell then undergoes the first meiotic division (meiosis I) to produce two secondary spermatocytes. Immediately following the completion of meiosis I, what is the number of chromosomes and the total number of chromatids, respectively, present in a single one of these secondary spermatocytes?\n\nA. 24 chromosomes, 48 chromatids\n\nB. 24 chromosomes, 24 chromatids\n\nC. 12 chromosomes, 24 chromatids\n\nD. 12 chromosomes, 12 chromatids\n\nE. 48 chromosomes, 48 chromatids", "solution": "Given $2n=24$ for somatic G1 cells, it follows that $n=12$. A primary spermatocyte arises as a diploid cell and, after completing S phase, each chromosome has replicated into two sister chromatids while the chromosome number remains unchanged. Therefore, immediately after S phase, the primary spermatocyte has $2n=24$ chromosomes and $2$ chromatids per chromosome, for a total of $2 \\times 24=48$ chromatids.\n\nMeiosis I separates homologous chromosomes (reductional division) but does not separate sister chromatids. Thus, at the completion of meiosis I, each secondary spermatocyte is haploid in terms of chromosome number, containing $n=12$ chromosomes, with each chromosome still consisting of two sister chromatids. Therefore, each secondary spermatocyte has $12$ chromosomes and $2 \\times 12=24$ chromatids.\n\nHence, the correct choice is $12$ chromosomes and $24$ chromatids, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1708251"}, {"introduction": "While spermatogenesis and oogenesis share the same meiotic framework, their outcomes are dramatically different. This next exercise explores the unique characteristics of oogenesis, particularly its asymmetric cell divisions that conserve cytoplasm for the future zygote. Understanding the fate of the primary oocyte—yielding one large ovum and smaller polar bodies—is essential for appreciating the specialized nature of female gamete formation and its genetic consequences.

During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes segregate following recombination (crossing over) in prophase I and independent assortment at metaphase I. Cytokinesis is highly asymmetric, producing one large secondary oocyte (haploid, $n$) and one small first polar body (haploid, $n$).\n\nThe secondary oocyte arrests at metaphase II and only completes meiosis II upon fertilization. Completion of meiosis II yields one large mature ovum (haploid, $n$) and a second polar body (haploid, $n$). The first polar body may or may not undergo its own division during meiosis II; thus, the total number of polar bodies is two or three. All products are haploid and genetically distinct because of recombination and independent assortment during meiosis I. Only the ovum is large and developmentally competent; polar bodies are small and non-viable for development.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because oogenesis does not produce four equal, viable haploid cells.\n- B is incorrect because the products are haploid, not diploid.\n- C is incorrect because only one ovum is produced.\n- D is correct: one large haploid ovum and two or three small haploid polar bodies, all genetically distinct.\n- E is incorrect because polar bodies are not genetically identical, and their number can be two or three.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1708225"}, {"introduction": "The process of meiosis, while remarkably precise, is not infallible.
