The compound has no effect on other cell types or transport proteins, including those in the proximal tubule or the beta-intercalated ($\\beta$-IC) cells.\n\nA healthy human subject with normal initial acid-base parameters ingests a dose of tubulostatin.

Alpha-intercalated cells normally secrete $H^{+}$ into the lumen via apical V-ATPase (and $H^{+}/K^{+}$-ATPase) and simultaneously add $HCO_{3}^{-}$ to blood via basolateral $Cl^{-}/HCO_{3}^{-}$ exchange (AE1). Inhibiting apical V-ATPase decreases luminal $H^{+}$ secretion, which reduces titratable acid and $NH_{4}^{+}$ excretion and thereby decreases generation of new $HCO_{3}^{-}$. With daily metabolic acid production unchanged, systemic acid accumulates and plasma $[HCO_{3}^{-}]$ falls.\n\nBy the Henderson–Hasselbalch relationship,\n$$\npH = pK_{a} + \\log\\!\\left(\\frac{[HCO_{3}^{-}]}{\\alpha P_{CO_{2}}}\\right),\n$$\nthe primary effect is a decrease in $[HCO_{3}^{-}]$, which lowers $pH$ and produces a metabolic acidosis.\n\nBecause no excess unmeasured anions are generated (the defect is impaired $H^{+}$ excretion rather than addition of organic acids), the decrease in $[HCO_{3}^{-}]$ is balanced by an increase in $[Cl^{-}]$ to maintain electroneutrality. The anion gap,\n$$\nAG = [Na^{+}] + [K^{+}] - \\big([Cl^{-}] + [HCO_{3}^{-}]\\big),\n$$\nremains approximately unchanged when the fall in $[HCO_{3}^{-}]$ is matched by a rise in $[Cl^{-}]$. Thus the pattern is a normal anion gap (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidosis.\n\nPhysiological compensation is respiratory. Peripheral chemoreceptor sensing of decreased $pH$ increases alveolar ventilation $V_{A}$, and with metabolic $CO_{2}$ production $\\dot{V}_{CO_{2}}$ unchanged, the relation\n$$\nP_{CO_{2}} \\propto \\frac{\\dot{V}_{CO_{2}}}{V_{A}}\n$$\nimplies a secondary decrease in $P_{CO_{2}}$, partially offsetting the fall in $pH$.\n\nAlternative options are inconsistent with the mechanism: metabolic alkalosis (A) is opposite to the expected effect of inhibited distal $H^{+}$ secretion; a high anion gap acidosis (B) requires accumulation of unmeasured anions, which does not occur here; primary respiratory acidosis (D) requires hypoventilation, not an isolated distal acidification defect; and complete compensation by proximal tubule or beta-intercalated cells (E) is not physiologically plausible, as proximal reabsorption of filtered $HCO_{3}^{-}$ does not replace distal net acid excretion, and beta-intercalated cells primarily secrete $HCO_{3}^{-}$ and are not a substitute for alpha-intercalated $H^{+}$ secretion.\n\nTherefore, after 24–48 hours, the expected finding is a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis with secondary hyperventilatory compensation (decreased $P_{CO_{2}}$) and hyperchloremia, which corresponds to distal renal tubular acidosis physiology and matches option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1737600"}, {"introduction": "Building on our understanding of acid secretion, we now turn to a practical clinical challenge: how can we determine if the kidneys are responding appropriately to an acid load?
