This diet leads to chronic changes in the patient's fluid and electrolyte balance, which in turn affects various homeostatic mechanisms. One of the key systems involved in regulating blood pressure and electrolyte balance is the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS). Assume the patient's body reaches a new steady state under this dietary regimen.\n\nWhich of the following sets of changes would be expected in the baseline plasma concentrations of renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone in this patient compared to a person on a normal diet?\n\nA.

Unchanged renin, Unchanged angiotensin II, Decreased aldosterone", "solution": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is regulated by: (i) renal perfusion pressure sensed by juxtaglomerular (JG) cells (inverse relationship with renin), (ii) sympathetic tone via $\\beta_{1}$ receptors (direct relationship with renin), and (iii) macula densa NaCl delivery (increased NaCl delivery suppresses renin). Aldosterone secretion from zona glomerulosa is primarily stimulated by angiotensin II and by elevated plasma $K^{+}$, and inhibited by low plasma $K^{+}$ and atrial natriuretic peptide.\n\nUnder a chronically high $Na^{+}$ intake, extracellular fluid volume and arterial pressure increase, and distal tubular NaCl delivery to the macula densa increases. Both increased perfusion pressure and increased macula densa NaCl suppress JG renin release. Therefore baseline plasma renin decreases.\n\nRenin catalyzes the formation of angiotensin I from angiotensinogen, which is converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme to angiotensin II. With decreased renin, the formation rate of angiotensin I and thus angiotensin II decreases. Therefore baseline plasma angiotensin II decreases.\n\nAldosterone secretion depends positively on angiotensin II and on plasma $K^{+}$. In this diet, plasma $K^{+}$ tends to be reduced due to low intake, which directly suppresses aldosterone secretion. In addition, decreased angiotensin II further diminishes aldosterone release. Therefore baseline plasma aldosterone decreases.\n\nCombining these effects yields decreased renin, decreased angiotensin II, and decreased aldosterone, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1752835"}, {"introduction": "Moving from physiology to pathophysiology, this problem explores Liddle's syndrome, a genetic disorder that creates a state of apparent mineralocorticoid excess. This thought experiment requires you to analyze how a constitutively active epithelial sodium channel ($ENaC$) in the kidneys impacts the entire RAAS cascade. Successfully predicting the resulting plasma renin and aldosterone levels demonstrates an understanding of how a downstream defect can override normal hormonal regulation, leading to a specific clinical presentation of hypertension [@problem_id:1752868].", "problem": "Liddle's syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the presence of constitutively active epithelial sodium channels in the principal cells of the kidney's collecting ducts. This means these channels remain open and reabsorb sodium ions from the tubular fluid into the blood, irrespective of the body's normal regulatory signals. The Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) is the primary hormonal cascade responsible for regulating long-term blood pressure and sodium balance.

In this condition [@problem_id:1752823], the body's tissues are unable to respond to aldosterone due to a defective mineralocorticoid receptor. This exercise tests your ability to reason through the consequences of a broken negative feedback loop, where the physiological stimuli for RAAS activation persist unchecked, leading to a paradoxical state of high renin and high aldosterone despite symptoms of aldosterone deficiency.", "problem": "A 25-year-old patient presents to an endocrinology clinic with a long-standing history of persistent fatigue, muscle weakness, and orthostatic hypotension (a significant drop in blood pressure upon standing). The patient also reports an unusual and strong craving for salty foods. Initial laboratory tests reveal abnormal plasma electrolyte levels. The consulting physician suspects a rare genetic condition known as pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1, which is characterized by target organ resistance to the hormone aldosterone due to a loss-of-function mutation in the mineralocorticoid receptor.\n\nAssuming the physician's hypothesis of a complete loss-of-function of the mineralocorticoid receptor is correct, which of the following combinations of physiological states and laboratory findings would be expected in this patient?\n\nA. Hypokalemia (low plasma potassium), Hypertension (high blood pressure), Low plasma renin activity, High plasma aldosterone\n\nB.

Hypokalemia (low plasma potassium), Hypertension (high blood pressure), High plasma renin activity, High plasma aldosterone\n\nE. Normal plasma potassium, Normotension (normal blood pressure), Low plasma renin activity, Low plasma aldosterone", "solution": "We begin by recalling the normal physiological actions of aldosterone at its target organs via the mineralocorticoid receptor. In the distal nephron (principal cells), aldosterone increases epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity and expression, and increases basolateral Na^{+}/K^{+}-ATPase activity. The consequence is increased Na^{+} reabsorption and increased K^{+} secretion; water reabsorption follows Na^{+}, expanding effective circulating volume and increasing arterial blood pressure. In addition, aldosterone promotes H^{+} secretion by alpha-intercalated cells, contributing to maintenance of acid-base balance. The rise in effective circulating volume provides negative feedback to the juxtaglomerular apparatus, lowering plasma renin activity and thereby decreasing angiotensin II and aldosterone production.\n\nIn pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 due to complete loss-of-function of the mineralocorticoid receptor, target organs are resistant to aldosterone. Functionally, this is equivalent at the kidney to a state of aldosterone deficiency despite normal or elevated circulating hormone. Therefore, the expected renal tubular effects are decreased Na^{+} reabsorption and impaired K^{+} secretion. The decrease in Na^{+} reabsorption leads to renal salt wasting and reduced water retention, producing a contraction of effective circulating volume and hypotension, clinically consistent with orthostatic hypotension and salt craving. Impaired K^{+} secretion leads to hyperkalemia. Reduced H^{+} secretion predisposes to a metabolic acidosis (type 4 renal tubular acidosis), though acid-base status is not queried in the options.\n\nThe fall in effective circulating volume is sensed by the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which increases renin release. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system therefore becomes activated:\n$$\\text{renin}\\ \\uparrow \\ \\Rightarrow\\ \\text{angiotensin II}\\ \\uparrow \\ \\Rightarrow\\ \\text{aldosterone}\\ \\uparrow.$$\nAdditionally, hyperkalemia directly stimulates aldosterone secretion from the zona glomerulosa. Despite these stimuli raising plasma aldosterone, the absent receptor function prevents aldosterone from producing its physiologic effects, so the negative feedback that would normally suppress renin does not occur. Thus both plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone remain elevated.\n\nPutting these pieces together, the expected combination is hyperkalemia, hypotension, high plasma renin activity, and high plasma aldosterone. Among the provided options, this corresponds to choice B. For completeness, options with hypertension and hypokalemia reflect effective mineralocorticoid excess (for example, primary hyperaldosteronism or Liddle syndrome), which is the opposite of receptor loss-of-function, and the option with low aldosterone would indicate primary adrenal failure rather than target organ resistance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1752823"}]}
