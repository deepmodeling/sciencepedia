This first practice problem explores the consequences of a defect in one such transporter, GLUT5, which is responsible for fructose uptake. By considering a hypothetical scenario of its complete absence, you will discover the direct link between a single molecular failure and the resulting physiological symptom, providing a clear illustration of the mechanism behind fructose malabsorption and osmotic diarrhea [@problem_id:1690294].", "problem": "An individual has a rare genetic mutation that results in the complete absence of functional Glucose Transporter type 5 (GLUT5) proteins on the apical membrane of their enterocytes. Enterocytes are the absorptive cells lining the small intestine. This individual consumes a large glass of a beverage sweetened exclusively with high-fructose corn syrup, which contains a significant amount of free fructose. Given that GLUT5 is the primary transporter responsible for the facilitated diffusion of fructose from the intestinal lumen into the enterocytes, which of the following digestive manifestations is most likely to be the primary and most immediate symptom experienced by this individual?\n\nA. Osmotic diarrhea\nB. Steatorrhea (fatty stools)\nC. Acute hyperglycemia (a rapid spike in blood glucose)\nD. Pernicious anemia\nE. Constipation", "solution": "We identify the key transport step and its physiological consequence. In the small intestine, fructose uptake from the lumen into enterocytes occurs primarily via GLUT5 on the apical membrane by facilitated diffusion. This carrier-mediated flux can be modeled by a Michaelis–Menten-type relation:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{GLUT5}}=\\frac{J_{\\max}\\,[\\text{fructose}]_{\\text{lumen}}}{K_{m}+[\\text{fructose}]_{\\text{lumen}}}.\n$$\nA complete absence of functional GLUT5 implies $J_{\\max}\\to 0$ for apical fructose transport, so\n$$\nJ_{\\text{apical, fructose}}\\approx 0,\n$$\nand thus fructose remains in the intestinal lumen. Fructose is a polar hexose with negligible transcellular diffusion without a transporter (effective permeability $P\\approx 0$), so passive lipid bilayer flux $J=P\\,A\\,\\Delta C$ is insignificant. Alternative apical carriers (for example SGLT1) do not transport fructose; therefore, compensatory apical uptake is effectively absent. Basolateral GLUT2 cannot substitute for apical entry.\n\nAccumulation of unabsorbed fructose increases the luminal osmolarity. The osmotic pressure difference across the epithelium can be expressed by the van ’t Hoff relation:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Pi = R T \\,\\Delta C_{\\text{osm}},\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta C_{\\text{osm}}=C_{\\text{lumen}}-C_{\\text{plasma}}$ increases due to the retained fructose. Water flux follows the osmotic gradient, and Starling-like water movement across the intestinal epithelium leads to net water entry into the lumen to equilibrate the osmotic difference. The immediate consequence of a luminal osmotic load from unabsorbed solute is watery stool, i.e., osmotic diarrhea.\n\nWe exclude the other options based on mechanism and time course:\n- Steatorrhea requires fat malabsorption (e.g., bile acid or pancreatic enzyme deficiency), not isolated fructose malabsorption.\n- Acute hyperglycemia would not occur because fructose absorption into blood is impaired; if anything, systemic fructose load is reduced, and fructose does not acutely raise blood glucose directly without hepatic processing.\n- Pernicious anemia is a chronic consequence of vitamin B12 malabsorption due to intrinsic factor deficiency, unrelated to fructose transport.\n- Constipation is opposite to the expected water influx driven by increased luminal osmolarity.\n\nTherefore, the primary and most immediate symptom is osmotic diarrhea.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1690294"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of specific transporters, this exercise shifts focus from the entry of sugars into the cell to their exit into the bloodstream. The intestinal enterocyte is a polarized cell with distinct transporters on its apical (lumen-facing) and basolateral (blood-facing) surfaces. This problem simulates the specific inhibition of the basolateral transporter GLUT2, creating a bottleneck that prevents absorbed sugars from leaving the cell, and challenges you to predict the immediate impact on the cell's internal environment [@problem_id:1690290].", "problem": "A novel experimental drug, Glucoblock, is being investigated for its effects on nutrient absorption. It has been determined that Glucoblock is a highly specific, non-competitive inhibitor of the Glucose Transporter 2 (GLUT2) protein located exclusively on the basolateral membrane of intestinal enterocytes. It has no effect on any other transporters, including the apical Sodium-Glucose Linked Transporter 1 (SGLT1) or the basolateral Na+/K+ ATPase pump.\n\nConsider a healthy individual who has just consumed a meal rich in carbohydrates, resulting in high concentrations of glucose and galactose in the intestinal lumen. If this individual is administered an effective dose of Glucoblock, what would be the most immediate and direct effect on the intracellular environment of their intestinal enterocytes?\n\nA. The intracellular concentrations of glucose and galactose will decrease.\nB. The intracellular concentrations of glucose and galactose will increase.\nC. The activity of the apical SGLT1 transporters will be allosterically enhanced, increasing the rate of sodium influx.\nD. The intracellular concentration of sodium ions will decrease.\nE. The transport of fructose out of the enterocyte will remain unaffected.", "solution": "We analyze the transport processes and fluxes across the enterocyte membranes in the presence of a specific, non-competitive inhibitor of basolateral GLUT2.\n\n1. Under a carbohydrate-rich meal, the luminal concentrations of glucose and galactose are high. Apical uptake is mediated by SGLT1, a secondary active cotransporter that couples monosaccharide influx to the inward sodium gradient maintained by the basolateral $\\text{Na}^{+}/\\text{K}^{+}$ ATPase. Denote the net apical influx of glucose or galactose via SGLT1 by $J_{\\text{SGLT1}}$. With high luminal substrate, $J_{\\text{SGLT1}}$ is large and positive (inward).\n\n2. Basolateral efflux of glucose, galactose, and fructose from the enterocyte into the blood is mediated by GLUT2 (facilitated diffusion). Denote this efflux by $J_{\\text{GLUT2}}$ (outward).\n\n3. The drug Glucoblock is a highly specific, non-competitive inhibitor of GLUT2 located exclusively on the basolateral membrane. Non-competitive inhibition decreases $V_{\\max}$ without changing $K_{m}$. Therefore, for GLUT2-mediated transport, the maximal efflux capacity is reduced independently of intracellular hexose concentration, so $J_{\\text{GLUT2}}$ is reduced toward zero at an effective inhibitor dose.\n\n4. The problem states there is no effect on any other transporters: apical SGLT1 and basolateral $\\text{Na}^{+}/\\text{K}^{+}$ ATPase remain fully active. Thus, $J_{\\text{SGLT1}}$ is unchanged by the drug at the instant of administration, and the sodium gradient is maintained.\n\n5. Let $C_{\\text{in}}^{\\text{glu}}$ and $C_{\\text{in}}^{\\text{gal}}$ be the intracellular concentrations of glucose and galactose, respectively. On the immediate time scale after GLUT2 inhibition, their rates of change can be written schematically as\n$$\n\\frac{dC_{\\text{in}}^{\\text{glu}}}{dt} = J_{\\text{SGLT1}}^{\\text{glu}} - J_{\\text{GLUT2}}^{\\text{glu}} - J_{\\text{met}}^{\\text{glu}}, \\quad\n\\frac{dC_{\\text{in}}^{\\text{gal}}}{dt} = J_{\\text{SGLT1}}^{\\text{gal}} - J_{\\text{GLUT2}}^{\\text{gal}} - J_{\\text{met}}^{\\text{gal}}.\n$$\nImmediately upon inhibition, $J_{\\text{SGLT1}}^{\\text{glu}}$ and $J_{\\text{SGLT1}}^{\\text{gal}}$ remain high due to high luminal substrate and intact transporter and sodium gradient, while $J_{\\text{GLUT2}}^{\\text{glu}}$ and $J_{\\text{GLUT2}}^{\\text{gal}}$ are markedly decreased by the non-competitive inhibition. Intracellular metabolic consumption terms $J_{\\text{met}}$ do not change instantaneously.

Consider the distractors:\n- Option A is incorrect because blocking basolateral efflux cannot decrease intracellular glucose or galactose when apical influx is ongoing.\n- Option C is incorrect because the drug does not act on SGLT1; non-competitive inhibition of GLUT2 does not allosterically enhance SGLT1 or increase sodium influx.\n- Option D is incorrect because $\\text{Na}^{+}$ handling is governed by SGLT1 influx and the $\\text{Na}^{+}/\\text{K}^{+}$ ATPase efflux; neither is inhibited. There is no immediate direct decrease in intracellular $\\text{Na}^{+}$ attributable to GLUT2 inhibition.\n- Option E is incorrect because fructose exits the enterocyte basolaterally via GLUT2 after apical entry via GLUT5; inhibiting GLUT2 will impair fructose efflux and thus does not leave it unaffected.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and direct effect is an increase in intracellular concentrations of glucose and galactose.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1690290"}, {"introduction": "This final practice integrates the principles of enzymatic digestion, specific transport, and physical chemistry into a single, quantitative challenge. You will model a clinically relevant scenario of SGLT1 deficiency, a condition where glucose and galactose cannot be absorbed from the gut.
