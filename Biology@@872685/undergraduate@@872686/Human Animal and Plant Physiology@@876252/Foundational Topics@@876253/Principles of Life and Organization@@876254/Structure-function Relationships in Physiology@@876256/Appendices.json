This mutation alters the ion channels in the plasma membranes of the stomatal guard cells, causing them to be permanently and maximally open. These modified guard cells are unable to respond to any internal or external signals, such as abscisic acid levels, light intensity, or ambient humidity. If this mutant plant is grown in a standard terrestrial environment with adequate soil water and a typical day-night cycle, which of the following options describes the most direct and critical physiological consequence for the plant?\n\nA.

An uncontrolled and massive loss of water through transpiration, leading to rapid wilting and severe dehydration.\n\nE. The immediate shutdown of sugar transport in the phloem, causing the root system to starve from a lack of energy.", "solution": "Stomatal aperture controls the conductance to both water vapor and carbon dioxide. Let the stomatal conductance to water vapor be denoted $g_{sw}$ and to carbon dioxide be $g_{sc}$. If guard cells are permanently and maximally open, then $g_{sw}$ and $g_{sc}$ are fixed at their maximal values, which removes the plant’s ability to downregulate gas and water exchange in response to environmental conditions.\n\nBy Fick’s law, a diffusive flux is proportional to conductance times the concentration gradient. For water vapor loss (transpiration) from a leaf, the steady-state flux can be expressed as\n$$\nE \\propto g_{sw}\\left(w_{i}-w_{a}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $w_{i}$ is the water vapor mole fraction in the leaf intercellular air spaces and $w_{a}$ is that of the ambient air. Because the substomatal air space is effectively saturated at leaf temperature, $w_{i}$ is near saturation, while $w_{a}$ is typically lower in a standard terrestrial environment. Fixing $g_{sw}$ at a maximal value therefore maximizes $E$ at any given vapor pressure deficit, including during the night when there is no photosynthesis.\n\nWater flow through the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum obeys\n$$\nJ = K_{h}\\left(\\Psi_{soil}-\\Psi_{leaf}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $J$ is the liquid water flux through the plant (which must equal the transpiration rate $E$ at steady state), $K_{h}$ is the whole-plant hydraulic conductance, $\\Psi_{soil}$ is soil water potential, and $\\Psi_{leaf}$ is leaf water potential. Solving for the leaf water potential gives\n$$\n\\Psi_{leaf}=\\Psi_{soil}-\\frac{E}{K_{h}}.\n$$\nWith $E$ maximized by permanently open stomata, $\\frac{E}{K_{h}}$ increases, forcing $\\Psi_{leaf}$ to become more negative. As $\\Psi_{leaf}$ declines, cell turgor pressure $\\Psi_{p}$ decreases according to $\\Psi_{w}=\\Psi_{s}+\\Psi_{p}+\\Psi_{g}+\\Psi_{m}$. When $\\Psi_{p}$ approaches zero (the turgor loss point), leaves wilt. Further decreases in $\\Psi_{leaf}$ increase xylem tension, elevating the risk of cavitation and loss of hydraulic conductivity, which exacerbates dehydration. Thus, the most direct and critical consequence is uncontrolled water loss leading to rapid wilting and severe dehydration.\n\nThe alternative options are inconsistent with core principles. For photosynthesis, net CO$_{2}$ assimilation can be written as\n$$\nA = g_{sc}\\left(c_{a}-c_{i}\\right),\n$$\nbut $A$ is capped by biochemical limits (e.g., Rubisco capacity and RuBP regeneration), so maximizing $g_{sc}$ merely drives $c_{i}\\to c_{a}$ and removes diffusion limitation; it does not produce runaway photosynthesis or toxic sugar accumulation. Oxygen efflux, $J_{O_{2}}=g_{so}(o_{i}-o_{a})$, is facilitated, not prevented, by open stomata, so oxygen will not accumulate. The primary driving force for xylem ascent is transpiration-driven tension; it is not eliminated but rather intensified when stomata are maximally open, so water uptake does not fail for lack of driving force (though it can fail secondarily due to cavitation caused by excessive tension). Phloem transport follows the pressure-flow mechanism and does not immediately shut down due to stomatal aperture alone.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and critical physiological consequence is uncontrolled, massive transpiration leading to rapid wilting and severe dehydration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1746211"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the cellular to the molecular realm, we encounter one of physiology's most remarkable proteins: titin.

This problem [@problem_id:1746225] allows you to model titin's unique modular design, calculating the force it generates and discovering how its distinct structural domains collaborate to produce a sophisticated, non-linear force response essential for muscle function.", "problem": "The giant protein titin is a key determinant of passive elasticity in vertebrate striated muscle. It functions as a molecular spring, spanning from the Z-disc to the M-line within each sarcomere. For this problem, we will model a single titin molecule as a simplified two-component system connected in series: a compliant, unstructured segment known as the PEVK region (rich in proline, glutamate, valine, and lysine), and a chain of tandem Immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains.\n\nThe PEVK segment's elastic behavior can be described by the following force-extension relationship:\n$$F = K_{\\text{PEVK}} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK}}}{L_c}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nwhere $F$ is the force, $\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK}}$ is the extension of the PEVK segment from its resting length, $K_{\\text{PEVK}}$ is a stiffness constant, and $L_c$ is a characteristic length scale of the polymer.\n\nThe Ig domains are folded protein modules that behave rigidly until a characteristic unfolding force, $F_{\\text{unfold}}$, is reached. At this force, the domains begin to unfold one by one. This unfolding process occurs at a nearly constant force, meaning that as the molecule is stretched further, the force remains at $F_{\\text{unfold}}$ while successive Ig domains unravel.\n\nConsider a single titin molecule in a half-sarcomere under passive stretch. The relevant parameters for this molecule are:\n- PEVK stiffness constant, $K_{\\text{PEVK}} = 5.00 \\text{ pN}$\n- PEVK characteristic length, $L_c = 40.0 \\text{ nm}$\n- Ig domain unfolding force, $F_{\\text{unfold}} = 28.0 \\text{ pN}$\n\nSuppose the half-sarcomere is stretched such that the total extension of the titin molecule from its resting state is $\\Delta L_{\\text{total}} = 250 \\text{ nm}$. Calculate the passive restoring force generated by this single titin molecule. Assume there are a sufficient number of Ig domains to accommodate this stretch.\n\nExpress your answer in piconewtons (pN). Round your final answer to two significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total passive force in a single titin molecule when it is stretched by a total amount $\\Delta L_{\\text{total}} = 250 \\text{ nm}$. The titin molecule is modeled as two components in series: the PEVK segment and a chain of Ig domains. In a series arrangement, the total extension is the sum of the extensions of the individual components, and the force is the same throughout the entire system.\n$$F_{\\text{total}} = F_{\\text{PEVK}} = F_{\\text{Ig}}$$\n$$\\Delta L_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK}} + \\Delta L_{\\text{Ig}}$$\nwhere $\\Delta L_{\\text{Ig}}$ is the extension due to the unfolding of Ig domains.\n\nThe key feature of the model is the behavior of the Ig domains. They do not contribute to the extension (i.e., $\\Delta L_{\\text{Ig}} = 0$) until the force in the molecule reaches the unfolding force, $F_{\\text{unfold}}$. Below this force, all extension is accommodated by the PEVK segment. Once the force reaches $F_{\\text{unfold}}$, the Ig domains begin to unfold, and the force remains \"clamped\" at this value as long as there are domains available to unfold.\n\nTherefore, the first step is to determine the state of the system at the given total extension. We need to find out whether the force has reached $F_{\\text{unfold}}$ or not. We can do this by calculating the maximum possible extension of the PEVK segment alone, which occurs at the precise moment the force reaches $F_{\\text{unfold}}$. Let's call this maximum PEVK extension $\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}}$.\n\nWe use the given force-extension relation for the PEVK segment:\n$$F = K_{\\text{PEVK}} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK}}}{L_c}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nSetting $F = F_{\\text{unfold}}$ and $\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK}} = \\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}}$, we can solve for $\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}}$:\n$$F_{\\text{unfold}} = K_{\\text{PEVK}} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}}}{L_c}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{F_{\\text{unfold}}}{K_{\\text{PEVK}}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}}}{L_c}\\right) - 1$$\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}}}{L_c}\\right) = \\frac{F_{\\text{unfold}}}{K_{\\text{PEVK}}} + 1$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}}}{L_c} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{F_{\\text{unfold}}}{K_{\\text{PEVK}}} + 1\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}} = L_c \\ln\\left(\\frac{F_{\\text{unfold}}}{K_{\\text{PEVK}}} + 1\\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $F_{\\text{unfold}} = 28.0 \\text{ pN}$, $K_{\\text{PEVK}} = 5.00 \\text{ pN}$, and $L_c = 40.0 \\text{ nm}$.\n$$\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}} = (40.0 \\text{ nm}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{28.0 \\text{ pN}}{5.00 \\text{ pN}} + 1\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}} = (40.0 \\text{ nm}) \\ln(5.60 + 1)$$\n$$\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}} = (40.0 \\text{ nm}) \\ln(6.60)$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(6.60) \\approx 1.887$:\n$$\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}} \\approx 40.0 \\times 1.887 \\text{ nm} \\approx 75.48 \\text{ nm}$$\n\nNow we compare this threshold extension with the given total extension, $\\Delta L_{\\text{total}} = 250 \\text{ nm}$.\nWe see that $\\Delta L_{\\text{total}} (250 \\text{ nm}) > \\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}} (75.48 \\text{ nm})$.\n\nThis comparison tells us that the total required extension is greater than what can be provided by the PEVK segment alone before reaching the Ig domain unfolding force. Therefore, the system must be in the regime where the Ig domains are unfolding to accommodate the additional stretch.\n\nAccording to the problem description, when Ig domains are unfolding, the force throughout the molecule is maintained at the constant unfolding force, $F_{\\text{unfold}}$. The total extension of $250 \\text{ nm}$ is accommodated by the PEVK segment stretching to $\\Delta L_{\\text{PEVK,max}} = 75.48 \\text{ nm}$ and the remaining extension, $250 \\text{ nm} - 75.48 \\text{ nm} = 174.52 \\text{ nm}$, is accommodated by the unfolding of several Ig domains. Regardless of how many domains unfold (as long as there are enough), the force is clamped.\n\nThus, the force in the titin molecule is:\n$$F_{\\text{total}} = F_{\\text{unfold}} = 28.0 \\text{ pN}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures.\n$$F_{\\text{total}} = 28 \\text{ pN}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{28}$$", "id": "1746225"}]}
