This first practice explores the fundamental consequences of the presence or absence of a cell wall by challenging you to predict the fate of an animal and a plant cell in a hypotonic environment. This classic thought experiment solidifies your grasp of osmosis, water potential, and the crucial role of turgor pressure in plant cells [@problem_id:1705332].", "problem": "An animal red blood cell and a living plant root cell are independently placed into separate beakers, each containing pure, distilled water. The intracellular solute concentration of both cells is significantly higher than that of the distilled water. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the ultimate fate of these two cells in this environment?\n\nA. Both cells will swell and eventually burst (lyse) because the high external water concentration causes a rapid influx of water.\n\nB. The red blood cell will swell and burst (lyse), while the plant root cell will swell but remain intact due to the structural support of its cell wall, developing turgor pressure.\n\nC. The plant root cell will undergo plasmolysis, with its plasma membrane shrinking away from the cell wall, while the red blood cell will remain unchanged.\n\nD. Both cells will shrink as they lose water to the surrounding hypotonic environment.\n\nE. The red blood cell will remain unchanged due to its homeostatic mechanisms, while the plant cell will swell and eventually burst.", "solution": "We analyze water movement by osmosis across selectively permeable membranes, driven by differences in water potential. The water potential is defined as $\\Psi=\\Psi_{p}+\\Psi_{s}$, where $\\Psi_{p}$ is the pressure potential and $\\Psi_{s}$ is the solute (osmotic) potential. By convention, pure water at atmospheric pressure has $\\Psi=0$ and $\\Psi_{s}=0$. The presence of solute makes $\\Psi_{s}<0$. Water moves spontaneously from higher $\\Psi$ to lower $\\Psi$.\n\nBoth the animal red blood cell and the plant root cell are placed in distilled water, so the external solution has $\\Psi_{\\text{out}}=0$. Each cell initially has intracellular solutes with $\\Psi_{s,\\text{in}}<0$, and before swelling $\\Psi_{p,\\text{in}}$ is approximately zero, so $\\Psi_{\\text{in}}=\\Psi_{p,\\text{in}}+\\Psi_{s,\\text{in}}<0$. Therefore, $\\Psi_{\\text{out}}-\\Psi_{\\text{in}}>0$, and water enters both cells down the water potential gradient. Equivalently, the osmotic pressure difference is given by the van 't Hoff relation $\\Pi=iRT\\Delta C$, where $i$ is the van 't Hoff factor, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\\Delta C$ is the solute concentration difference; a positive $\\Pi$ favors water influx.\n\nFor the red blood cell (no cell wall), water influx increases cell volume and membrane tension. Because the plasma membrane lacks a rigid supporting wall, it cannot generate a sufficiently large counteracting $\\Psi_{p}$ to balance the osmotic drive before reaching its mechanical failure threshold. As swelling continues, membrane tension exceeds its critical limit, and the cell undergoes lysis (hemolysis).\n\nFor the plant root cell (with a rigid cell wall), water influx initially increases volume, but the cell wall resists expansion and develops a positive $\\Psi_{p}$ (turgor pressure). As swelling proceeds, $\\Psi_{p,\\text{in}}$ increases until it offsets the negative $\\Psi_{s,\\text{in}}$ such that $\\Psi_{\\text{in}}=\\Psi_{p,\\text{in}}+\\Psi_{s,\\text{in}}=0=\\Psi_{\\text{out}}$. At this point, net water movement ceases and the cell becomes turgid but remains intact due to the structural support of the cell wall. It does not lyse under these conditions.\n\nTherefore, the red blood cell will swell and burst, while the plant root cell will swell and become turgid without bursting. This corresponds to option B. The other options are inconsistent with these principles: plasmolysis occurs in hypertonic, not hypotonic, solutions; both cells do not shrink in hypotonic solutions; and a red blood cell does not remain unchanged in pure water.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1705332"}, {"introduction": "To understand how the intricate machinery inside a cell works, scientists must first be able to separate the components. This exercise moves from theory to practice, asking you to design a protocol for isolating nuclei and mitochondria from a cell homogenate. By applying the principles of differential centrifugation based on organelle size and density, you will engage with the logic behind one of cell biology's most foundational techniques [@problem_id:1705289].", "problem": "A researcher is developing a protocol to isolate two specific organelles, nuclei and mitochondria, from a fresh sample of homogenized mammalian liver cells. The process relies on differential centrifugation, a technique that separates components of a mixture by spinning them in a centrifuge at various speeds. The sedimentation of a particle depends on its size and density; larger and denser particles form a solid pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge tube at lower centrifugal forces than smaller, less dense particles. For a typical mammalian liver cell, nuclei are significantly larger and denser than mitochondria. The initial sample is the total cell homogenate.\n\nThe goal is to obtain two separate fractions: one enriched with nuclei and another enriched with mitochondria. Which of the following procedures correctly describes the sequence of steps to achieve this separation?\n\nA. Centrifuge the homogenate at high speed (e.g., 15,000 x g). Collect the supernatant and discard the pellet. Then, centrifuge this supernatant at a low speed (e.g., 600 x g) and collect the resulting pellet as the mitochondrial fraction and the final supernatant as the nuclear fraction.\n\nB. Centrifuge the homogenate at low speed (e.g., 600 x g). Collect the pellet, which contains the nuclear fraction. Then, centrifuge the supernatant from the first spin at a higher speed (e.g., 15,000 x g) and collect the resulting pellet, which contains the mitochondrial fraction.\n\nC. Centrifuge the homogenate at high speed (e.g., 15,000 x g). Collect the pellet, which contains a mix of both organelles. Resuspend this pellet and centrifuge again at low speed (e.g., 600 x g). Collect the resulting supernatant as the mitochondrial fraction and the pellet as the nuclear fraction.\n\nD. Centrifuge the homogenate at low speed (e.g., 600 x g). Collect the pellet, which contains the mitochondrial fraction. Then, centrifuge the supernatant from the first spin at a higher speed (e.g., 15,000 x g) and collect the resulting pellet, which contains the nuclear fraction.", "solution": "Differential centrifugation separates cellular components by their sedimentation velocities under a centrifugal field. In the Stokes regime, the terminal sedimentation velocity of a roughly spherical particle of radius $a$ and density $\\rho_{p}$ in a medium of density $\\rho_{m}$ and viscosity $\\eta$, at angular speed $\\omega$ and radial position $r$, scales as\n$$\nv=\\frac{2 a^{2}(\\rho_{p}-\\rho_{m}) \\omega^{2} r}{9 \\eta}.\n$$\nThus, larger and denser particles have greater $v$ at a given $\\omega$, so they pellet at lower centrifugal forces and/or shorter times than smaller, less dense particles. For mammalian cell homogenates, nuclei are larger and denser than mitochondria, so at a low centrifugal force, nuclei pellet while mitochondria remain in the supernatant; at a higher centrifugal force applied to that supernatant, mitochondria pellet.\n\nApplying this principle to the options:\n- Option A starts with a high-speed spin, which would pellet both nuclei and many mitochondria together; discarding this pellet would lose the desired organelles, and a subsequent low-speed spin cannot pellet mitochondria. Therefore A is incorrect.\n- Option B performs a low-speed spin first to pellet nuclei (nuclear fraction), then applies a higher-speed spin to the supernatant to pellet mitochondria (mitochondrial fraction). This matches the expected sequence from the dependence of $v$ on $a$ and $(\\rho_{p}-\\rho_{m})$. Therefore B is correct.\n- Option C uses a high-speed spin first to pellet both organelles together, then a low-speed spin on the resuspended pellet to pellet nuclei and leave mitochondria in the supernatant. However, mitochondria would not be pelleted in that step and would remain in the supernatant mixed with smaller components; calling that supernatant the mitochondrial fraction without a subsequent higher-speed pelleting step is incorrect. Therefore C is incorrect.\n- Option D asserts that low speed pellets mitochondria and that high speed then pellets nuclei from the supernatant; this inverts the known order and contradicts the velocity scaling, so D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct procedure is to pellet nuclei at low speed, then pellet mitochondria from the supernatant at higher speed, as described in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1705289"}, {"introduction": "Eukaryotic cells are defined by their complex, interconnected systems, such as the protein secretory pathway. This final practice presents a molecular puzzle: you must trace the journey of a protein when a critical component of the trafficking machinery, the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP), is mutated. Solving this requires a precise understanding of the endomembrane system and demonstrates how a single molecular failure can reroute a vital cellular process [@problem_id:1705299].", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is studying protein trafficking in a specialized human cell line. They introduce a mutation into the gene encoding a subunit of the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP). This mutation has a very specific effect: the assembled SRP can still recognize and bind to the N-terminal signal peptide of a nascent polypeptide chain emerging from a ribosome, but it is completely unable to bind to the SRP receptor, a protein complex embedded in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).\n\nThese engineered cells are then induced to synthesize a large quantity of a specific protein, let's call it \"secretase,\" which under normal conditions is an enzyme destined for secretion into the extracellular environment. Assume that protein synthesis proceeds to completion despite the trafficking defect.\n\nGiven this specific mutation, identify the most probable final subcellular location where the fully synthesized secretase enzyme will accumulate.\n\nA.

Embedded within the inner mitochondrial membrane", "solution": "The problem asks for the final location of a secretory protein in a cell with a specific mutation in the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP). To solve this, we must first understand the normal pathway for protein secretion and then analyze how the described mutation disrupts this pathway.\n\n**Step 1: The Canonical Secretory Pathway**\n1.  **Initiation of Translation:** Synthesis of all proteins, including secretory ones like secretase, begins on free ribosomes in the cytosol.\n2.  **Signal Peptide Synthesis:** As the ribosome translates the mRNA, the first part of the protein to be synthesized is an N-terminal sequence of amino acids called the signal peptide. This sequence acts as an address label, targeting the protein for the secretory pathway.\n3.  **SRP Binding:** As the signal peptide emerges from the ribosome, a functional Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) binds to both the signal peptide and the ribosome. This binding event causes a temporary pause in translation.\n4.  **Targeting to the ER:** The entire complex—consisting of the ribosome, the mRNA, the nascent polypeptide chain, and the SRP—is targeted to the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).\n5.  **Docking at the ER Membrane:** The SRP in the complex binds to the SRP receptor, which is an integral membrane protein complex in the ER membrane. This interaction \"docks\" the ribosome at the ER.\n6.  **Translocation:** Upon binding, the SRP and its receptor dissociate in a GTP-dependent process. The ribosome is transferred to a protein channel in the ER membrane called the translocon. The translation pause is lifted, and protein synthesis resumes. The growing polypeptide chain is threaded through the translocon directly into the lumen of the ER. This process is known as co-translational translocation.\n7.  **Post-ER Processing:** Inside the ER lumen, the signal peptide is typically cleaved off by a signal peptidase. The protein folds and may undergo modifications. It is then transported via vesicles to the Golgi apparatus for further processing and sorting, and finally packaged into secretory vesicles that fuse with the plasma membrane to release the protein into the extracellular space (exocytosis).\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Mutation's Effect**\nThe problem states that the mutated SRP can still perform its first function (binding the signal peptide and ribosome), but fails at its second function (binding the SRP receptor). Let's trace the consequences:\n\n1.  Protein synthesis for secretase begins on a free ribosome in the cytosol. (Normal)\n2.  The N-terminal signal peptide is synthesized and emerges from the ribosome. (Normal)\n3.  The mutated SRP binds to the signal peptide, and translation is paused. The problem states this function is intact. (Normal)\n4.  The SRP-ribosome-nascent chain complex diffuses through the cytosol and encounters the ER membrane. (Normal)\n5.  **Critical Failure Point:** The SRP attempts to bind to the SRP receptor on the ER membrane, but due to the mutation, this binding cannot occur. The docking step fails.\n\n**Step 3: Deducing the Final Outcome**\nSince the ribosome cannot dock at a translocon channel on the ER, co-translational translocation into the ER lumen cannot happen. The entire complex remains in the cytosol. The translational pause induced by SRP is not a permanent state; the SRP will eventually dissociate from the ribosome-nascent chain complex. When this happens, protein synthesis will resume.\n\nBecause the ribosome is not attached to the ER, translation will continue and complete while the ribosome is free in the cytosol. The result is a full-length secretase protein, including its N-terminal signal peptide (as the signal peptidase that would normally cleave it is located inside the ER lumen), being released directly into the cytosol.\n\nThe protein now finds itself in the cytosol. It does not possess a nuclear localization signal, a mitochondrial targeting sequence, or a peroxisomal targeting signal. Therefore, it has no mechanism to be imported into these other organelles. It cannot enter the ER post-translationally because it was designed for co-translational import, a pathway that is now blocked. Its final destination, therefore, is to remain where it was synthesized: the cytosol.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the Options**\n*   **A. The lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum:** Incorrect. This is the first destination in the normal pathway, but the protein cannot enter the ER because the SRP-receptor interaction is blocked.\n*   **B. The extracellular space:** Incorrect. This is the ultimate normal destination, but it requires successful entry into the ER and passage through the Golgi and secretory vesicles.\n*   **C. The cytosol:** Correct. Synthesis is completed on a free ribosome, and the protein is released into the cytosol because it fails to dock at the ER.\n*   **D. The lumen of the Golgi apparatus:** Incorrect. Entry into the Golgi is dependent on prior entry into the ER.\n*   **E. The lysosome:** Incorrect. Lysosomal proteins are also targeted via the ER-Golgi pathway, so this route is also blocked.\n*   **F. Embedded within the inner mitochondrial membrane:** Incorrect. This requires a specific mitochondrial targeting sequence and import machinery, which a secretory protein like secretase does not have.\n\nTherefore, the only logical outcome is the accumulation of the secretase protein in the cytosol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1705299"}]}
