This fundamental geometric constraint has profound implications for cell viability. In this first practice, we will quantify this challenge by modeling a simple spherical cell that must actively pump ions to counteract leakage across its membrane. By determining how the required number of ion pumps scales with the cell's radius, you will gain a concrete understanding of why larger cells face an ever-increasing logistical burden on their surfaces.

To maintain its physiological functions, it must keep the internal concentration of a specific ion constant. This is challenging because the ion continuously leaks out of the cell through its membrane. The leakage rate is uniform across the entire surface. To counteract this diffusive loss, the cell's membrane is equipped with a large number of ion pumps that actively transport the ion back into the cytoplasm.\n\nAssume the following:\n- The cell is a perfect sphere with a radius $r$.\n- The leakage of ions out of the cell occurs at a constant flux $L$, defined as ions per unit area per unit time.\n- Each individual ion pump actively transports ions into the cell at a constant rate $P$, defined as ions per pump per unit time.\n- To maintain a stable internal ion concentration, the total rate of ions being pumped into the cell must exactly balance the total rate of ions leaking out.\n\nDerive an expression for $N(r)$, the total number of ion pumps required on the cell's membrane as a function of its radius $r$.

While subdividing starch into smaller granules increases the surface area for enzymes to act upon, enzymatic efficiency can decrease on highly curved surfaces. Your task is to move beyond simple maximization and find the *optimal* granule size that perfectly balances the benefit of a large surface area against the penalty of reduced efficiency, revealing how natural selection can fine-tune structures at the microscopic level for maximum performance.
