The organism has a constant volumetric metabolic rate, denoted by $R_m$, which is the moles of O2 consumed per unit volume per unit time. The diffusion of oxygen within the organism's tissue is characterized by a diffusion coefficient $D$. The organism lives in water with a constant and uniform external oxygen concentration of $C_{ext}$.\n\nA biophysical model for the steady-state oxygen concentration, $C(r)$, at a radial distance $r$ from the center of the organism is given by the equation:\n$$C(r) = C_s - \\frac{R_{m}}{6D}(R^2 - r^2)$$\nwhere $C_s$ is the oxygen concentration at the surface of the organism ($r=R$). Assume that a thin, stagnant layer of water around the organism does not impede oxygen transport, such that the concentration at the surface is equal to the external concentration, i.e., $C_s = C_{ext}$.\n\nFor the organism to remain viable, the oxygen concentration at its very center must be greater than or equal to zero.
