This first practice explores a classic scenario: can a wild-type root system \"rescue\" the phenotype of a mutant shoot that is unable to produce its own strigolactones? This exercise [@problem_id:1743477] tests your understanding of hormone transport and the concept of a long-distance, mobile signal.", "problem": "In plant developmental biology, a class of hormones known as Strigolactones (SLs) plays a crucial role in regulating plant architecture. One of their primary functions is to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds, thus suppressing the formation of lateral shoots and controlling the overall extent of branching. In a typical plant, these hormones are synthesized predominantly in the root system and are then transported upwards through the vasculature to the aerial parts of the plant, including the stem and axillary buds.\n\nConsider a species of plant for which two lines exist: a wild-type (WT) line, which exhibits a normal, regulated branching pattern, and a mutant line, which we will call `sl-syn`. The `sl-syn` mutant has a defect in a key gene for Strigolactone biosynthesis, rendering it incapable of producing its own SLs. As a result, ungrafted `sl-syn` plants display a phenotype of excessive, uncontrolled shoot branching.\n\nAn experiment is performed where a shoot cutting, known as the scion, is taken from an `sl-syn` mutant plant and is grafted onto the root system, known as the rootstock, of a WT plant. The graft union is successful, and the composite plant is allowed to grow.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes best describes the shoot branching phenotype that will be observed in the `sl-syn` mutant scion as the composite plant matures?\n\nA. The scion will exhibit excessive shoot branching, identical to an ungrafted `sl-syn` mutant plant.\n\nB. The scion will exhibit a normal branching pattern, identical to a wild-type (WT) plant.\n\nC. The scion will grow for a short period and then die due to a long-term incompatibility between the mutant and wild-type tissues.\n\nD. The scion will exhibit an extreme suppression of branching, growing as a single, unbranched stem.\n\nE. The branching of the scion will be normal, but the WT rootstock will develop an unusually large and dense root system to compensate for the mutant scion.", "solution": "Principle: Strigolactones (SLs) are synthesized mainly in roots, move acropetally through the vasculature, and inhibit axillary bud outgrowth in shoots. Therefore, SL action on shoot branching can be supplied non-locally by root-derived hormone.\n\nGenetic context: The `sl-syn` mutant is defective in SL biosynthesis but not necessarily in SL perception or signaling. Biosynthesis mutants typically retain responsiveness to exogenous or transported SLs; hence their phenotype can be complemented by supplying SL from another tissue.\n\nGraft setup: A `sl-syn` scion is grafted onto a WT rootstock. The WT rootstock produces SLs at normal levels. These SLs are transported upwards into the scion via the xylem.\n\nExpected outcome: Because the scion’s defect is in synthesis and the WT rootstock supplies the hormone, the scion receives sufficient SL to suppress axillary bud outgrowth to wild-type levels. Thus, the scion’s branching phenotype is rescued to normal.\n\nExclusion of alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because excessive branching would persist only if SL could not be supplied or if the scion were defective in perception/signaling; here the defect is in synthesis and transport is intact.\n- C is incorrect because WT and mutant tissues are generally graft-compatible in such experiments.\n- D is unlikely because WT-derived SL levels regulate within physiological ranges; mere grafting does not cause supra-physiological suppression beyond WT.\n- E is unrelated to the SL-specific shoot branching phenotype; the question centers on shoot branching, and WT roots do not necessarily overproliferate to compensate for a biosynthesis-defective scion.\n\nTherefore, the scion will exhibit a normal WT-like branching pattern.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1743477"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how a wild-type rootstock can complement a mutant shoot, we now examine the reverse scenario. What happens when a genetically normal shoot is grafted onto a root system that cannot produce strigolactones? This reciprocal experiment [@problem_id:1743468] is crucial for confirming that the roots are indeed a primary source of the mobile signal required to suppress shoot branching.", "problem": "In plant biology, a class of hormones known as Strigolactones (SLs) are critical regulators of plant architecture. A key function of SLs is the suppression of axillary bud outgrowth, which in turn controls the degree of shoot branching.\n\nA researcher is studying a species of pea plant. The wild-type (WT) plants exhibit a standard, moderately branched phenotype. The researcher has access to a specific mutant line, named `rms1`, which is deficient in a key enzyme for SL synthesis. Consequently, `rms1` mutant plants are unable to produce their own SLs and display an excessively branched, \"bushy\" phenotype. It is known, however, that the cells and tissues of an `rms1` mutant are fully capable of perceiving and responding to SLs if the hormone is provided from an external source.\n\nTo investigate the source of the SL signal that controls shoot branching, the researcher performs a grafting experiment. A shoot, known as the scion, from a WT plant is carefully grafted onto the root system, known as the rootstock, of an `rms1` mutant plant. The graft is successful, and the composite plant is allowed to grow under optimal conditions.\n\nBased on the principles of hormone action and transport in plants, which of the following outcomes most accurately describes the phenotype of the wild-type scion in this grafted plant?\n\nA. The WT scion will exhibit a normal, moderately branched phenotype, identical to an un-grafted WT plant, because the scion's own genetic makeup is sufficient to control its development.\n\nB. The WT scion will exhibit an excessively branched, \"bushy\" phenotype, similar to that of an un-grafted `rms1` mutant plant.\n\nC. The WT scion will exhibit a normal, moderately branched phenotype because the WT shoot tissues can synthesize all the necessary SLs locally to control their own bud outgrowth.\n\nD. The WT scion will exhibit even less branching than a normal WT plant, becoming almost a single, unbranched stem, due to a compensatory response to the mutant rootstock.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the key biological principles established for strigolactones (SLs) in pea:\n- Function: SLs suppress axillary bud outgrowth, thereby limiting shoot branching.\n- Biosynthesis site: In pea, a major source of SLs is the root system. The gene RMS1 encodes a carotenoid cleavage enzyme required for SL biosynthesis; the rms1 mutant lacks SL production but retains full SL perception and response capacity.\n- Transport: SLs (or their active mobile forms) move acropetally from the roots to the shoots via the xylem stream to systemically regulate bud outgrowth.\n- Grafting logic: When only one part (rootstock or scion) is SL-deficient in biosynthesis but both can perceive SLs, the phenotype of the shoot reflects whether an adequate SL supply reaches the shoot via long-distance transport.\n\nApply these to the graft described:\n1) The scion is wild type (WT), so its cells can perceive and respond to SLs normally.\n2) The rootstock is rms1 and thus cannot synthesize SLs.\n3) Because roots are a primary source of SLs that move to the shoot, an rms1 rootstock will fail to deliver SL through the xylem to the scion. Therefore, the composite plant’s shoot will be systemically SL-deficient despite having normal receptors and signaling machinery.\n4) In the absence of sufficient SL supply, axillary buds are not suppressed, leading to increased branching (a bushy phenotype), which recapitulates the hallmark phenotype of SL-deficient mutants.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because normal scion genotype is not sufficient if the systemic hormone supply from roots is absent; shoot phenotype depends on the mobile SL signal.\n- B is correct because an rms1 rootstock cannot supply SL to the WT scion, so the scion behaves as SL-deficient and becomes excessively branched.\n- C is incorrect because local SL biosynthesis in the WT shoot is not sufficient to replace the root-derived systemic SL signal that normally restricts branching in pea; grafting experiments historically show that WT rootstock rescues rms1 shoots, whereas WT shoots on rms1 roots are not rescued.\n- D is incorrect because there is no mechanism for compensatory over-suppression of branching; the expected outcome is deficiency-induced increased branching, not reduced branching.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate outcome is that the WT scion exhibits a bushy, excessively branched phenotype due to lack of root-derived SL supply from the rms1 rootstock.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1743468"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond the whole plant, we now delve into the genetic basis of signaling. For a hormone to act, it must be produced (synthesis) and then recognized by the cell (perception). This practice [@problem_id:1743473] challenges you to predict the distinct phenotypes of a synthesis mutant versus a perception mutant, considering strigolactones' dual role in both internal growth regulation and external communication with symbiotic fungi.", "problem": "A plant biologist is investigating the function of a class of hormones called Strigolactones (SLs) in pea plants. SLs are known to be involved in regulating plant architecture and in facilitating symbiotic relationships with soil microbes. The biologist prepares an experiment using three distinct genotypes:\n1.  **Wild-Type (WT):** A normal pea plant that synthesizes and responds to SLs correctly.\n2.  **`sl-syn` mutant:** A mutant that is deficient in a key enzyme for SL biosynthesis, rendering it unable to produce any SLs.\n3.  **`sl-d14` mutant:** A mutant that produces SLs normally but lacks a functional D14 receptor protein, which is essential for the plant to perceive and initiate a response to SLs within its own cells.\n\nAll three genotypes are grown from seed under identical conditions in pots containing sterile soil that has been inoculated with spores of an Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) fungus. AM fungi are known to form a beneficial symbiosis with plant roots, a process which is initiated by chemical signals exuded from the roots. After several weeks of growth, the biologist plans to assess two key characteristics: (1) the degree of shoot branching, and (2) the percentage of root length that has been successfully colonized by the AM fungus.\n\nBased on the established dual roles of strigolactones as both internal hormones and external signaling molecules for symbiosis, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of the experiment?\n\nA. Both the `sl-syn` and `sl-d14` mutants will show increased shoot branching compared to the WT. AM fungal colonization will be severely reduced in the `sl-d14` mutant but will be similar to WT levels in the `sl-syn` mutant.\n\nB. Both the `sl-syn` and `sl-d14` mutants will show increased shoot branching compared to the WT. AM fungal colonization will be severely reduced in the `sl-syn` mutant, while the `sl-d14` mutant will show colonization levels comparable to the WT.\n\nC. The `sl-syn` mutant will show increased shoot branching, but the `sl-d14` mutant will have branching similar to the WT. Both mutants will show severely reduced AM fungal colonization compared to the WT.\n\nD. Both the `sl-syn` and `sl-d14` mutants will show branching and AM fungal colonization levels that are indistinguishable from the WT, suggesting that other hormonal pathways fully compensate for these specific genetic defects.\n\nE. The `sl-d14` mutant will show increased shoot branching, while the `sl-syn` mutant will have branching similar to the WT. AM fungal colonization would be expected to be normal in both mutants.", "solution": "We first state the two distinct roles of strigolactones (SLs) grounded in established plant physiology:\n- As internal hormones, SLs inhibit axillary bud outgrowth and thus suppress shoot branching. This endogenous signaling requires both SL biosynthesis and perception via the D14 receptor in plant cells.\n- As external rhizosphere signals, SLs are exuded by roots and perceived by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi to stimulate hyphal branching and initiate symbiosis. This step depends on SL production and exudation by the plant but does not require the plant’s D14 receptor for the fungus to respond.\n\nPredictions for shoot branching:\n- In the wild type (WT), SLs are synthesized and perceived via D14, so axillary bud outgrowth is inhibited and branching remains relatively low.\n- In the sl-syn mutant, SL biosynthesis is abolished; therefore, no endogenous SL signal reaches D14. Even with a functional D14 receptor, the absence of ligand means the SL pathway is inactive. By the principle that SLs suppress branching, loss of SLs leads to increased shoot branching.\n- In the sl-d14 mutant, SLs are synthesized normally, but the D14 receptor is nonfunctional. Endogenous SL signals cannot be perceived, which phenocopies loss of SL signaling. Thus, shoot branching is increased, similar to SL biosynthetic mutants.\n\nPredictions for AM fungal colonization:\n- Initiation of AM symbiosis requires SL exudation from roots to the soil, where the fungus perceives these molecules to undergo hyphal branching and host seeking. The fungal response depends on the presence of SLs in the rhizosphere; plant D14 is not required for the fungus to perceive SLs.\n- In WT, SL exudation is normal; AM colonization is high.\n- In sl-syn, SLs are not produced, so there is negligible or severely reduced SL exudation. The AM fungus receives little to no exogenous SL signal; hence colonization is severely reduced.\n- In sl-d14, SL production and exudation are normal because biosynthesis is intact. Although plant endogenous perception is defective, the external SL signal to the fungus remains. Therefore, AM colonization is expected to be similar to WT.\n\nCombining these outcomes:\n- Both sl-syn and sl-d14 show increased shoot branching relative to WT.\n- AM colonization is severely reduced in sl-syn but similar to WT in sl-d14.\n\nThis pattern corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1743473"}]}
