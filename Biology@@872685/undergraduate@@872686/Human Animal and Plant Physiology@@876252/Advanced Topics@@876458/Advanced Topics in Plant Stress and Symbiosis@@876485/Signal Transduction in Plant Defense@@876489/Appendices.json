This exercise explores the strategic trade-off between two major defense hormone pathways: the salicylic acid ($SA$) and jasmonic acid ($JA$) systems. By considering a plant genetically engineered to lack $SA$, you will apply your knowledge of how plants tailor their immunity against pathogens with different lifestyles [@problem_id:1741858].", "problem": "A plant physiologist is studying the intricacies of plant immune signaling. In most plants, defense against pathogens is primarily orchestrated by two major hormone signaling pathways: the Salicylic Acid (SA) pathway and the Jasmonic Acid (JA) pathway. The SA pathway is generally considered the primary defense against biotrophic pathogens, which are parasites that establish a long-term feeding relationship with living host cells. In contrast, the JA pathway is typically more effective against necrotrophic pathogens, which rapidly kill host cells to feed on the dead tissue, and also against herbivorous insects. A well-documented phenomenon in these signaling networks is antagonistic crosstalk, where the activation of one pathway often leads to the suppression of the other, allowing the plant to mount a specialized defense.\n\nTo investigate these interactions, the physiologist engineers a mutant plant line that has a non-functional version of the *ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE 1* (*ICS1*) gene, a critical enzyme for SA biosynthesis. As a result, this mutant plant is incapable of producing SA. The physiologist then inoculates both the SA-deficient mutant plants and wild-type (non-mutant) plants with a biotrophic fungus known to cause disease in this plant species.\n\nCompared to the wild-type plant, which of the following outcomes is the most likely for the SA-deficient mutant plant's interaction with the biotrophic fungus?\n\nA. The mutant plant will show significantly decreased resistance to the fungus, leading to more severe disease symptoms, because the primary defense pathway tailored for combating biotrophic pathogens has been disabled.\n\nB. The mutant plant will show enhanced resistance to the fungus because the absence of SA signaling will lead to a constant, high-level activation of the JA pathway, providing a more robust and superior overall defense.\n\nC. The plant's resistance level will be unchanged because plant immune systems possess high levels of redundancy, allowing other signaling molecules and pathways to fully compensate for the lack of SA.\n\nD. The mutant plant will become completely immune to the fungus because SA acts as a recognition signal for this specific pathogen, and its absence renders the plant \"invisible\" to the fungus.\n\nE. The mutant plant will show increased susceptibility to the fungus, but it will also exhibit a dramatic increase in growth and flower production due to the reallocation of resources away from the costly SA pathway.", "solution": "We begin by stating the established principles of plant immune signaling relevant to this scenario:\n- The salicylic acid (SA) pathway is the primary defense against biotrophic pathogens that feed on living host cells.\n- The jasmonic acid (JA) pathway is primarily effective against necrotrophic pathogens and herbivorous insects.\n- Antagonistic crosstalk exists between SA and JA pathways, such that activation of one tends to suppress the other.\n\nNext, we analyze the genetic perturbation:\n- The mutant lacks a functional ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE 1 (ICS1), an essential enzyme in the principal SA biosynthetic route in many plants. Therefore, the mutant is SA-deficient and cannot activate canonical SA-dependent defenses, including the induction of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and systemic acquired resistance.\n\nWe then predict the outcome upon infection with a biotrophic fungus:\n- Because SA-mediated signaling is central to resistance against biotrophs, the inability to produce SA compromises the plant’s capacity to mount an effective defense. Empirically, SA-deficient mutants exhibit increased susceptibility to biotrophic pathogens.\n- Although antagonism implies that reduced SA could relieve suppression on JA signaling, enhanced JA activity does not substitute effectively for SA in defense against biotrophs and can even be maladaptive in this context. Thus, increased JA signaling does not confer superior resistance to a biotrophic fungus.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the options:\n- Option A correctly states that disabling the SA pathway leads to decreased resistance to a biotroph and more severe disease.\n- Option B is incorrect because JA upregulation does not compensate for SA loss against biotrophs and is not necessarily constitutively high simply due to absence of SA.\n- Option C is incorrect because redundancy does not fully compensate for the lack of SA; ICS1 mutants are well known to be more susceptible to biotrophs.\n- Option D is incorrect because SA is not a recognition cue for the pathogen; it is an internal defense hormone.\n- Option E introduces an unsupported claim of dramatic growth/flower increases; while growth-defense trade-offs exist, this is not the central or reliably observed outcome in ICS1 mutants, and the key predicted interaction with the biotroph is increased susceptibility as in A.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is described by A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1741858"}, {"introduction": "A specific defense response begins with precise molecular recognition. This problem delves into the elegant modular architecture of Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeat (NLR) proteins, the intracellular sentinels of the plant immune system. Through a thought experiment involving a chimeric receptor, you will dissect how distinct protein domains for recognition and signaling cooperate to launch a targeted defense, illustrating a fundamental principle of protein engineering and function [@problem_id:1741841].", "problem": "In plant immunology, Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeat (NLR) proteins are intracellular receptors that play a crucial role in recognizing pathogen-derived molecules, known as effectors, and initiating a defense response. The canonical NLR protein architecture consists of three domains: a variable N-terminal domain for signaling, a central Nucleotide-Binding domain adapted from Apaf-1, R proteins, and CED-4 (NB-ARC) that functions as a molecular switch, and a C-terminal Leucine-Rich Repeat (LRR) domain responsible for pathogen recognition.\n\nConsider two distinct NLR proteins in a model plant species:\n1.  **NLR_B**: This protein possesses an N-terminal Toll/Interleukin-1 Receptor (TIR) domain. It specifically recognizes the bacterial effector protein `Eff_B` and, upon activation, triggers a robust Hypersensitive Response (HR), a form of localized programmed cell death.\n2.  **NLR_F**: This protein has an N-terminal Coiled-Coil (CC) domain. It specifically recognizes the fungal effector `Eff_F` and, upon activation, initiates a signaling pathway leading to the production of antifungal compounds, but does not trigger HR.\n\nA genetic engineer creates a chimeric receptor, **NLR_C**, by swapping the recognition domains. NLR_C consists of the TIR and NB-ARC domains from NLR_B combined with the LRR domain from NLR_F. This chimeric NLR_C is then expressed in a transgenic plant line that naturally lacks both NLR_B and NLR_F.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes is the most accurate prediction for what will happen when this transgenic plant is inoculated with the fungus that produces `Eff_F`?\n\nA. The plant will show no response because the TIR domain of NLR_C is incompatible with the LRR domain from NLR_F.\n\nB. The plant will produce antifungal compounds because the LRR domain from NLR_F dictates the signaling output.\n\nC. The plant will mount a Hypersensitive Response (HR) at the site of inoculation.\n\nD. The plant will not respond to the fungus, but would now respond to the bacterium that produces `Eff_B`.\n\nE. The plant will simultaneously produce antifungal compounds and exhibit a Hypersensitive Response (HR).", "solution": "Step 1: Establish canonical NLR domain functions.\n- The C-terminal LRR domain determines effector recognition specificity by binding or sensing the effector or its activity.\n- The central NB-ARC domain is a nucleotide-regulated molecular switch; effector recognition promotes exchange to an active state that permits signaling.\n- The N-terminal domain dictates the signaling output: TIR-type NLRs (TNLs) typically signal through EDS1-family modules and strongly elicit Hypersensitive Response (HR), whereas CC-type NLRs (CNLs) often trigger defense outputs that may include antimicrobial production, with HR not being obligatory.\n\nStep 2: Apply known behaviors of the two parental NLRs.\n- NLR_B (TIR-NB-ARC-LRR_B) recognizes bacterial effector Eff_B and triggers robust HR. This indicates that a TIR N-terminus in the active state drives HR.\n- NLR_F (CC-NB-ARC-LRR_F) recognizes fungal effector Eff_F and initiates antifungal compound production without HR. This indicates CC-driven signaling yields a non-HR defense output in this context.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the chimeric receptor NLR_C composition and predicted function.\n- NLR_C combines TIR + NB-ARC from NLR_B with LRR from NLR_F, i.e., TIR-NB-ARC-LRR_F.\n- The LRR_F domain should confer recognition specificity to Eff_F. Therefore, when the fungus producing Eff_F is present, LRR_F can recognize Eff_F, promoting activation of the NB-ARC switch.\n- Once activated, the signaling output is determined by the N-terminal domain present in NLR_C, which is TIR. Consequently, the downstream pathway is TIR-type, which canonically promotes HR.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate options based on the domain logic.\n- A is unlikely: although some chimeras can fail due to incompatibilities, the most accurate general prediction is that LRR dictates recognition and the N-terminus dictates output; there is no principled requirement that TIR is incompatible with LRR_F.\n- B is incorrect: the LRR dictates recognition, not the signaling output. Output is set by the N-terminal domain.\n- C is consistent: recognition of Eff_F via LRR_F activates a TIR-driven response, leading to HR.\n- D is incorrect: NLR_C lacks LRR_B and therefore would not gain recognition of Eff_B.\n- E is unlikely: a single activated NLR typically produces the signaling output dictated by its N-terminus, not a simultaneous CC-like and TIR-like combined output.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is that the plant will mount a Hypersensitive Response at the site of inoculation upon recognizing Eff_F through the chimeric receptor’s LRR_F with a TIR signaling module.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1741841"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the sequence of events in a signaling cascade is a central goal in cell biology.

The first mutant, `sid2`, is deficient in SA biosynthesis. The second mutant, `nia1/nia2`, is deficient in NO synthesis.
