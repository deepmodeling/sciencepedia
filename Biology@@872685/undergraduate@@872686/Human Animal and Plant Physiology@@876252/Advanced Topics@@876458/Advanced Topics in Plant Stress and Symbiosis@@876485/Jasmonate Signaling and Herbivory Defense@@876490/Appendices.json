{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding how a biological pathway works often begins with a mutant that breaks the system. In this first exercise, we encounter a plant that is highly susceptible to insects, pointing to a defect in its jasmonate-mediated defense. The challenge is to devise a simple experiment to determine if the plant fails to *produce* the jasmonate signal or fails to *perceive* it. This practice introduces a foundational concept in genetics and physiology: using external application to bypass a biological step and logically deduce the location of a defect in a pathway [@problem_id:1714748].", "problem": "A plant biologist discovers a new mutant strain of a model plant, designated `sus1` (susceptible 1), which shows extreme vulnerability to herbivory by leaf-eating insects compared to its wild-type (WT) counterpart. The biologist hypothesizes that the mutation affects the jasmonate signaling pathway, a crucial component of the plant's induced defense system.\n\nThis pathway can be simplified into two major stages. First, physical damage from an insect bite triggers the *synthesis* of the hormone jasmonate (JA). Second, JA binds to cellular receptors, initiating a signaling cascade that results in *perception* of the signal and the subsequent production of defensive proteins that deter the insects.\n\nThe `sus1` mutation could be causing a defect in either JA synthesis or JA perception. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the biologist designs an experiment. They will treat both WT and `sus1` plants with a solution that externally applies jasmonate. After a set period, they will measure the expression level (quantified as \"low\" or \"high\") of a well-known defense gene that is normally activated by JA signaling.\n\nWhich of the following experimental outcomes would provide the strongest evidence that the `sus1` mutant has a defect in JA *perception* rather than JA synthesis?\n\nA. Untreated WT plants show low expression, and JA-treated WT plants show high expression. Untreated `sus1` plants show low expression, and JA-treated `sus1` plants also show low expression.\n\nB. Untreated WT plants show low expression, and JA-treated WT plants show high expression. Untreated `sus1` plants show low expression, but JA-treated `sus1` plants show high expression.\n\nC. Both WT and `sus1` plants show high expression regardless of whether they are treated with JA.\n\nD. Both WT and `sus1` plants show low expression regardless of whether they are treated with JA.\n\nE. Untreated WT plants show low expression, but JA-treated WT plants show high expression. Untreated `sus1` plants show high expression, which decreases to low expression after JA treatment.", "solution": "We formalize the jasmonate (JA) defense pathway as two sequential steps: (1) synthesis of JA upon herbivory damage; (2) perception of JA via receptors that initiate downstream signaling and activate defense-gene expression. The critical experimental principle is that exogenous JA application bypasses step (1) but still requires an intact step (2). Therefore:\n- If a mutant is defective in JA synthesis but has normal perception, exogenous JA should restore signaling, converting a low baseline expression to high expression after treatment.\n- If a mutant is defective in JA perception, exogenous JA will not trigger signaling, so expression remains low both before and after treatment.\n\nApply these predictions to the options:\n- A: WT is low untreated and high with JA (expected). The mutant is low untreated and remains low after JA, which is the diagnostic pattern for a perception defect. This directly shows that even when synthesis is bypassed, signaling fails, implicating perception.\n- B: The mutant switches from low to high with JA, which is the diagnostic pattern for a synthesis defect, not perception.\n- C: Both WT and mutant are high regardless of treatment, inconsistent with a requirement for JA; not informative for distinguishing synthesis vs perception.\n- D: Both WT and mutant are low regardless of treatment; this contradicts normal JA responsiveness in WT and is not interpretable for the mutant’s specific defect.\n- E: The mutant is high untreated and decreases after JA; this is inconsistent with the canonical JA-activated response and does not support a perception defect.\n\nThus, the outcome that most strongly supports a defect in JA perception is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1714748"}, {"introduction": "Having distinguished between signal synthesis and perception, we now zoom into the molecular machinery of the perception step. The recognition of jasmonate and the subsequent activation of defenses is not a single event but a carefully orchestrated process involving multiple proteins working together. This problem focuses on the SCF-COI1 complex, the critical E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for marking JAZ repressors for destruction. By considering a mutation in a key component of this complex, you can practice predicting how the failure of one molecular part can cascade to a systemic failure of the entire defense response [@problem_id:1714753].", "problem": "In wild-type plants, physical damage from herbivory triggers the synthesis of the hormone jasmonate (JA). The active form of this hormone, jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), binds to its receptor, a protein called CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1). This binding event enables the COI1 protein to interact with a family of repressor proteins known as Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins.\n\nIn the cellular machinery, COI1 is part of a larger multi-protein complex called the SCF-COI1 complex, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The formation of this complex requires COI1, a Cullin protein, and a Skp1 protein. When a JAZ repressor is bound by the JA-Ile/COI1 complex, the SCF-COI1 E3 ligase targets the JAZ protein for ubiquitination, marking it for degradation by the 26S proteasome.\n\nJAZ proteins normally function by repressing transcription factors, such as MYC2. The degradation of JAZ proteins releases these transcription factors, allowing them to activate the expression of defense genes. The products of these genes, such as proteinase inhibitors, help to deter further herbivory.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered mutant plant line that expresses a fully functional COI1 receptor protein but is completely deficient in the Skp1 protein. If this mutant plant is subjected to sustained herbivory, which of the following outcomes is most likely to be observed?\n\nA. The plant will exhibit a hyper-defensive response, producing excessive amounts of defense compounds even with minor damage, because JAZ proteins will be constitutively degraded.\n\nB. The plant will be unable to degrade JAZ proteins, leading to a failure to express defense genes and increased susceptibility to herbivores.\n\nC. The plant will show a normal defense response, as the functional COI1 receptor is sufficient to initiate the signaling cascade upon JA-Ile binding.\n\nD. The plant will be unable to synthesize jasmonate (JA-Ile) in response to herbivory, preventing the initiation of any defense signaling.\n\nE. The transcription factor MYC2 will be constitutively active in the absence of Skp1, leading to a permanent state of defense even without herbivory.", "solution": "1) State the normal pathway components and sequence. Herbivory increases jasmonate levels, and the active hormone JA-Ile binds COI1. COI1 is the F-box component of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that requires Skp1 and a Cullin to assemble. In the presence of JA-Ile, COI1 engages JAZ repressors, and the SCF-COI1 complex ubiquitinates JAZ proteins, targeting them for 26S proteasome degradation. Loss of JAZ de-represses transcription factors such as MYC2, enabling defense gene expression.\n\n2) Identify the specific role of Skp1. Skp1 is the adaptor that bridges the F-box protein (COI1) to the Cullin scaffold, completing the SCF E3 ligase architecture. Without Skp1, the SCF-COI1 complex cannot assemble and lacks E3 ligase activity.\n\n3) Predict the consequence of Skp1 deficiency with functional COI1. Even if COI1 can bind JA-Ile and engage JAZ proteins, the absence of Skp1 prevents formation of a functional SCF-COI1 E3 ligase. Therefore, JAZ proteins cannot be ubiquitinated and will not be targeted for proteasomal degradation.\n\n4) Infer the downstream transcriptional outcome. Stabilized JAZ repressors continue to inhibit MYC2 and related transcription factors, preventing activation of jasmonate-responsive defense genes. Consequently, the plant fails to mount an effective defense response and becomes more susceptible to herbivory.\n\n5) Evaluate the options. \n- A is incorrect because JAZ degradation requires an intact SCF-COI1 complex; without Skp1, JAZ is stabilized, not constitutively degraded.\n- B is correct because Skp1 loss blocks JAZ ubiquitination and degradation, preventing defense gene expression.\n- C is incorrect because a functional COI1 alone is insufficient; the SCF complex is required for ubiquitination.\n- D is incorrect because Skp1 is not required for JA-Ile biosynthesis.\n- E is incorrect because MYC2 remains repressed by undegraded JAZ; it is not constitutively active.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is described by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1714753"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate test of our understanding is to predict how molecular changes translate into whole-organism traits. This final practice moves from pathway logic to ecophysiology by examining two distinct mutations: one that blocks the defense pathway (loss-of-function) and one that leaves it permanently active (gain-of-function). Your task is to predict the consequences for both plant defense and plant growth, directly engaging with the critical concept of the growth-defense trade-off. This exercise highlights how the precise regulation of signaling pathways is essential for balancing survival and resource allocation in a changing environment [@problem_id:1714696].", "problem": "In plant biology, the jasmonate (JA) signaling pathway is a critical defense mechanism against chewing insects. The pathway operates as follows: In the absence of an insect attack, JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) proteins act as repressors, binding to and inactivating transcription factors that would otherwise switch on defense genes. When a plant is attacked, it synthesizes the signaling molecule jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile). JA-Ile binds to its receptor, an F-box protein called CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1). This binding event causes the COI1-containing protein complex to tag the JAZ repressor proteins for degradation. The removal of JAZ repressors liberates the transcription factors, which then activate the expression of a suite of defense genes, leading to the production of anti-herbivore compounds. This defense response is effective but metabolically costly, often leading to reduced plant growth due to the diversion of resources.\n\nA plant biologist is studying two mutant lines of a model plant, alongside a normal Wild-Type (WT) plant.\n- **Mutant A:** Possesses a non-functional *coi1* allele, resulting in a COI1 protein that cannot bind to JA-Ile.\n- **Mutant B:** Possesses a mutation that makes its JAZ proteins constitutively unstable, leading to their constant degradation, irrespective of JA-Ile presence.\n\nThe biologist grows all three plant types (WT, Mutant A, and Mutant B) in a controlled environment. For each plant type, half the population is exposed to herbivorous caterpillars and the other half is left unexposed as a control. Based on your understanding of the JA signaling pathway and the associated growth-defense trade-offs, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the observable phenotypes?\n\nA. Mutant A will show growth comparable to the unexposed WT plant but will be highly susceptible to herbivory. Mutant B will be highly resistant to caterpillars but will show stunted growth compared to the unexposed WT plant, regardless of caterpillar presence.\n\nB. Mutant B will show growth comparable to the unexposed WT plant but will be highly susceptible to herbivory. Mutant A will be highly resistant to caterpillars but will show stunted growth compared to the unexposed WT plant, regardless of caterpillar presence.\n\nC. Both Mutant A and Mutant B will be highly susceptible to herbivory. Mutant A will have growth comparable to the unexposed WT, while Mutant B will have stunted growth.\n\nD. Both Mutant A and Mutant B will be highly resistant to herbivory. Mutant A will have stunted growth, while Mutant B will have growth comparable to the unexposed WT.\n\nE. Mutant A will be phenotypically identical to the Wild-Type plant under all conditions. Mutant B will be highly resistant to caterpillars but will show stunted growth compared to the unexposed WT plant, regardless of caterpillar presence.", "solution": "The jasmonate signaling logic is as follows. In the absence of herbivory, JAZ repressors bind and inactivate defense transcription factors, so defense genes remain off and resources are allocated to growth. Upon herbivory, the plant synthesizes JA-Ile; JA-Ile binding to COI1 enables the SCF^{COI1} complex to target JAZ proteins for degradation. Degradation of JAZ releases transcription factors to activate defense genes, producing anti-herbivore compounds. This activated defense state increases resistance but imposes a metabolic cost that reduces growth relative to the uninduced state.\n\nWild-Type (WT) predictions:\n- Unexposed: JAZ intact, defense off, maximal growth, low constitutive resistance.\n- Exposed: JA-Ile induces COI1-dependent JAZ degradation, defense on, higher resistance, reduced growth due to defense cost.\n\nMutant A (non-functional coi1; COI1 cannot bind JA-Ile):\n- Mechanism: Without JA-Ile binding to COI1, the SCF^{COI1} complex cannot target JAZ for degradation even when JA-Ile is present. JAZ repressors persist and continue to inhibit defense transcription factors.\n- Phenotype: Defense genes fail to activate upon herbivory, making the plant highly susceptible to caterpillars. Because defense is not induced, the plant does not pay the metabolic defense cost and thus, in the absence of herbivory, exhibits growth comparable to unexposed WT. When exposed to herbivores, susceptibility leads to high damage; the key mechanistic prediction remains lack of induced defense and absence of defense-associated growth penalty.\n\nMutant B (constitutively unstable JAZ; constant degradation independent of JA-Ile):\n- Mechanism: JAZ proteins are continually degraded regardless of JA-Ile, freeing defense transcription factors constitutively.\n- Phenotype: Defense genes are always on, conferring high resistance to caterpillars in both exposed and unexposed conditions. Constitutive defense imposes a persistent metabolic cost, causing stunted growth relative to unexposed WT regardless of caterpillar presence.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A matches the mechanistic predictions: Mutant A is highly susceptible and shows growth comparable to unexposed WT when not attacked; Mutant B is highly resistant but shows stunted growth regardless of exposure.\n- B reverses roles and is inconsistent with the pathway.\n- C incorrectly claims Mutant B is susceptible.\n- D incorrectly claims Mutant A is resistant and Mutant B has normal growth.\n- E incorrectly asserts Mutant A is phenotypically identical to WT under all conditions; WT can induce defense whereas Mutant A cannot.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1714696"}]}
