The primary enzyme responsible for breaking down caffeine in the human liver is Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2). Variations in the gene that codes for this enzyme can lead to \"fast\" or \"slow\" metabolism phenotypes. One common type of genetic variation is a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), which is a change in a single DNA base pair at a specific position in the genome.\n\nThe researcher has sequenced a small segment of the coding strand of the *CYP1A2* gene from two individuals: one known to be a fast metabolizer and one known to be a slow metabolizer.

CTG | GTC | CAA | TTA | GGC ...\nDelete the G at the start of GTC:\n... CTG | TCC | AAT | TAG | GC ...\nThis exactly matches the Selkirk Rex codon progression, including the premature stop at TAG.\n- Therefore, the mutation is a single-nucleotide deletion causing a frameshift with altered downstream amino acids and a premature stop codon.\n\nEliminate alternatives:\n- A (silent point mutation) is false because the amino acid changes at and after the fourth codon.\n- B (nonsense point mutation in the sixth codon) is false because changes begin at the fourth codon and reflect a frameshift, not an isolated single-codon substitution.\n- D (missense at the fourth codon only) is false because downstream codons also change and a premature stop appears.\n- E (frameshift by insertion) is inconsistent with the observed pattern that is parsimoniously explained by a deletion of the G starting the fourth codon.\n\nThus, the correct choice is a frameshift due to a single nucleotide deletion producing altered downstream amino acids and a premature stop.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1700836"}, {"introduction": "Significant physiological differences between species often arise not from changes in proteins themselves, but from changes in how genes are regulated. This exercise [@problem_id:1700814] explores this crucial concept through a thought experiment based on the differing regenerative abilities of salamanders and mammals. By considering the divergence in non-coding regulatory DNA versus the conservation of protein-coding DNA, you will predict the outcome of a hypothetical transgenic experiment, revealing why the control of gene expression is a primary engine of evolutionary change.", "problem": "A developmental biologist is investigating the genetic basis for limb regeneration, a remarkable ability present in salamanders but largely absent in mammals. The research focuses on the Muscle segment homeobox 1 (*Msx1*) gene, which is essential for forming the blastema—a mass of undifferentiated cells that drives limb regrowth in salamanders.\n\nThe biologist makes two critical observations through comparative genomic analysis:\n1.  The protein-coding sequence of the *Msx1* gene is highly conserved between salamanders and mice. This indicates that the resulting Msx1 proteins (which are orthologs) likely perform a very similar biochemical function in both species.\n2.  The non-coding DNA regions located upstream of the *Msx1* gene are highly divergent. These regions contain the `cis`-regulatory elements (e.g., promoters and enhancers) that control when, where, and to what level the gene is transcribed.\n\nTo test the functional implications of this regulatory divergence, the biologist performs a transgenic experiment. The entire *Msx1* gene from a salamander, including its protein-coding sequence and its native upstream `cis`-regulatory region, is inserted into the genome of a mouse. The researcher then analyzes the expression of this newly introduced salamander gene in the developing limb buds of the transgenic mouse embryos.\n\nBased on the information provided, which of the following statements describes the most plausible outcome for the expression of the salamander-derived *Msx1* gene within the transgenic mouse?\n\nA. The salamander *Msx1* gene will be expressed in the mouse limb bud in a pattern identical to the native mouse *Msx1* gene because the two genes are orthologs.\n\nB. The salamander *Msx1* gene will be robustly expressed in the mouse limb bud, leading to the development of enhanced regenerative capabilities in the mouse.\n\nC. The salamander *Msx1* gene will show little to no expression in any tissue, including the limb bud, because the mouse's transcriptional machinery cannot effectively recognize the salamander's regulatory DNA.\n\nD. The salamander *Msx1* gene will be transcribed and translated, but the resulting salamander protein will be immediately identified as foreign and degraded by the mouse's cellular quality control systems.\n\nE. The salamander *Msx1* gene will be expressed ectopically (in incorrect tissues) throughout the mouse embryo because its regulatory logic is not compatible with the mouse developmental program.", "solution": "1) Premise about orthology and protein function: Observation 1 states that the protein-coding sequence of the salamander and mouse *Msx1* genes is highly conserved. The principle is that orthologous proteins with conserved sequences typically retain similar biochemical functions. Therefore, if the salamander Msx1 protein is produced in mouse cells, it is expected to fold and function comparably to the mouse Msx1 protein. This rules out outcomes predicated on the protein being inherently unusable or targeted as “foreign” by generic cellular quality control.\n\n2) Principle of cis-regulatory control: Observation 2 emphasizes that the non-coding upstream regions (promoters and enhancers) are highly divergent. The principle is that spatial, temporal, and quantitative patterns of gene expression are specified by cis-regulatory elements that integrate inputs from transcription factors. These elements act as logical control modules; their activity depends on the presence of compatible transcription factor binding sites and the appropriate chromatin context. Divergence in these elements can disrupt the ability of the host species’ transcription factors to bind with sufficient affinity and combinatorial logic to drive normal expression.\n\n3) Consequence of cross-species cis-regulatory divergence: In a transgenic mouse carrying the salamander *Msx1* gene with its native salamander cis-regulatory region, transcription depends on mouse transcription factors recognizing salamander enhancer and promoter motifs. Core transcriptional machinery is broadly conserved among vertebrates, so the basal promoter may be recognized to some extent. However, limb bud-specific expression typically requires enhancers that encode a particular arrangement and affinity of binding sites for limb-patterning transcription factors. If these enhancers are highly diverged, mouse factors may bind weakly or not in the requisite combinations, yielding severely reduced or absent limb bud expression. Thus, the most likely net effect is minimal or undetectable expression in the relevant tissues, even though the coding region itself is functional.\n\n4) Evaluation of options:\n- A is unlikely because identical protein function does not imply identical expression; the inserted salamander gene is regulated by salamander cis elements, and regulatory divergence predicts a different or absent pattern relative to the native mouse *Msx1* expression.\n- B is unlikely because robust expression requires compatible enhancer logic; furthermore, complex traits like regeneration are polygenic and circuit-level properties, not conferred by a single gene’s expression alone.\n- C is plausible because divergence of cis-regulatory sequences typically reduces enhancer compatibility, leading to little or no expression in specific contexts such as the limb bud. While absolute inability of the mouse machinery to recognize any salamander regulatory DNA is overstated in general terms, among the provided options this best captures the expected functional outcome: insufficient recognition to drive detectable, appropriate expression.\n- D is incorrect because cellular quality control does not degrade a correctly folded, properly synthesized protein on the basis of being from another species; post-translational quality control targets misfolded proteins, not “foreign” sequences per se.\n- E is unlikely because incompatibility of enhancers more often causes loss or reduction of expression in the target tissues rather than ubiquitous, ectopic activation throughout the embryo; enhancers require specific combinations of factors and do not generally default to widespread activation.\n\n5) Conclusion: Given regulatory divergence and the requirement for species-compatible enhancer logic to achieve limb bud expression, the most plausible outcome is little to no expression of the salamander *Msx1* transgene in mouse limb buds (and likely minimal expression overall), matching option C more closely than the alternatives.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1700814"}]}
