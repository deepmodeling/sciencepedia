This first practice problem [@problem_id:1698830] presents a classic diagnostic challenge: distinguishing ataxia caused by cerebellar damage from that caused by a loss of sensory feedback. By considering a simple modification to a standard neurological test, you will explore how the reliance on visual information can reveal the underlying cause of a motor deficit.", "problem": "A clinician is examining two patients, both of whom present with ataxia, a form of motor incoordination characterized by a lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements. Specifically, both patients have difficulty accurately touching their own nose with their index finger from an outstretched arm position.\n\nPatient 1 has a confirmed lesion in their cerebellum.\nPatient 2 has a neurological condition that has led to a significant loss of somatic sensation (the sense of touch and body position) in their arms, but their cerebellar function and muscle strength are intact.\n\nWhich of the following simple modifications to the finger-to-nose test would be most effective in distinguishing the cerebellar ataxia of Patient 1 from the sensory ataxia of Patient 2?\n\nA. Having the patients perform the test with their eyes closed.\n\nB. Having the patients perform the test while simultaneously reciting the alphabet backwards.\n\nC. Having the patients perform the test using their non-dominant hand instead of their dominant hand.\n\nD. Having the patients perform the test at a much faster speed.\n\nE. Having the patients hold a small weight in their hand while performing the test.", "solution": "We identify the clinical principle relevant to distinguishing cerebellar ataxia from sensory ataxia. In sensory ataxia, proprioceptive input is impaired; patients compensate using visual feedback. Removing visual input (by closing the eyes) unmasks the deficit, producing a marked deterioration in coordination. This phenomenon is the basis of a positive Romberg sign. In contrast, cerebellar ataxia reflects impaired coordination due to cerebellar dysfunction; visual input does not normalize performance, so coordination remains impaired whether the eyes are open or closed.\n\nApply this principle to the two patients:\n- Patient 1 (cerebellar lesion): Finger-to-nose testing shows dysmetria and intention tremor that persist regardless of visual input. Closing the eyes does not substantially worsen performance beyond the baseline ataxia.\n- Patient 2 (loss of somatic sensation with intact cerebellum): With eyes open, visual guidance can partially compensate, allowing relatively improved accuracy. With eyes closed, the loss of visual feedback removes compensation, and performance deteriorates markedly.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- Option A (eyes closed) specifically removes visual compensation, worsening sensory ataxia (Patient 2) but not significantly altering cerebellar ataxia (Patient 1); thus, it best distinguishes the two.\n- Option B (reciting the alphabet backwards) introduces divided attention but does not target proprioceptive compensation versus cerebellar coordination and is nonspecific.\n- Option C (use non-dominant hand) affects baseline performance similarly in both patients and does not leverage the key difference in sensory reliance on vision.\n- Option D (faster speed) may worsen both types of ataxia and does not specifically discriminate based on visual compensation.\n- Option E (holding a small weight) changes inertia and proprioceptive input in complex ways and is not a reliable discriminator between sensory and cerebellar ataxia.\n\nTherefore, the most effective modification to distinguish cerebellar from sensory ataxia is having the patients perform the test with their eyes closed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1698830"}, {"introduction": "The cerebellum is not a uniform structure; its different anatomical regions are specialized for distinct aspects of motor control. This exercise [@problem_id:1698829] challenges you to act as a neurologist, correlating specific patterns of motor deficits—such as problems with motor learning versus problems with movement execution—to lesions in either the cerebrocerebellum or the spinocerebellum. This practice deepens your understanding of the functional organization that allows the cerebellum to manage everything from planning a complex skill to correcting a simple reach.", "problem": "Two right-handed patients, Patient Alpha and Patient Beta, present with distinct motor deficits following small, focal ischemic strokes of similar volume within the cerebellum.\n\nPatient Alpha displays significant difficulty in learning new, complex motor sequences. For instance, when asked to learn a novel, intricate finger-tapping pattern, they are unable to improve the timing and order of the taps even after multiple practice sessions. They also struggle with planning multi-joint movements, such as coordinating their arm and hand to catch a ball thrown with an unusual trajectory. However, their gait is relatively stable, and if their arm is unexpectedly bumped while reaching for a stationary object, they can correct its path reasonably well.\n\nPatient Beta, in contrast, can describe the plan for a complex motor sequence correctly but executes it poorly. When reaching for a target, their movements are jerky and inaccurate, frequently overshooting or undershooting the mark (dysmetria). As their hand nears the target, a coarse, low-frequency tremor becomes apparent (intention tremor). Their walking gait is unsteady and wide-based.\n\nOne patient has a lesion primarily affecting the cerebrocerebellum (lateral hemispheres), which is heavily involved in motor planning and learning. The other has a lesion primarily affecting the spinocerebellum (vermis and paravermal zones), which is critical for online error correction and execution of movement. Based on these classic functional distinctions, which of the following statements correctly identifies the lesion locations for each patient?\n\nA. Patient Alpha has a spinocerebellar lesion; Patient Beta has a cerebrocerebellar lesion.\n\nB. Patient Alpha has a cerebrocerebellar lesion; Patient Beta has a spinocerebellar lesion.\n\nC. Both patients have cerebrocerebellar lesions, with Patient Alpha’s being more anterior and Patient Beta’s more posterior.\n\nD. Both patients have spinocerebellar lesions, with Patient Alpha’s affecting the vermis and Patient Beta’s affecting the paravermal zone.\n\nE. The symptom profiles are inconsistent with cerebellar damage and are more characteristic of pathology in the basal ganglia.", "solution": "Identify the relevant cerebellar functional divisions and their classic roles:\n- The cerebrocerebellum (lateral hemispheres, projecting via the dentate nucleus through the cerebrocerebellar loop) is heavily involved in motor planning, timing, and the acquisition and adaptation of complex motor sequences (motor learning). Lesions here produce impairments in learning new sequences, temporal ordering of movements, and coordinating multi-joint, planned actions; axial gait and basic online correction can be relatively spared if the spinocerebellar system is intact.\n- The spinocerebellum (vermis and paravermal/intermediate zones, projecting via fastigial and interposed nuclei) provides online error correction and regulates execution of ongoing movements, particularly gait and limb trajectory. Lesions here classically cause gait ataxia (vermis involvement), limb ataxia with dysmetria and decomposition, and intention tremor as the target is approached (paravermal involvement).\n\nMap each patient’s findings to these functions:\n- Patient Alpha: Marked difficulty learning complex motor sequences and planning multi-joint movements indicates impaired motor planning and learning, which is characteristic of cerebrocerebellar dysfunction. The relatively stable gait and reasonable ability to correct a perturbed reach suggest that basic execution and online error correction mediated by the spinocerebellum are relatively preserved. Therefore, Patient Alpha’s presentation localizes primarily to the cerebrocerebellum.\n- Patient Beta: The ability to describe the plan but poor execution with jerky, inaccurate movements, dysmetria (overshoot/undershoot), intention tremor near the target, and an unsteady, wide-based gait all indicate impaired online error correction and execution affecting both axial and limb control. This pattern is characteristic of spinocerebellar dysfunction (vermis for gait/truncal ataxia; paravermal for limb dysmetria and intention tremor). Therefore, Patient Beta’s presentation localizes primarily to the spinocerebellum.\n\nMatch to the options: This mapping corresponds to Patient Alpha with a cerebrocerebellar lesion and Patient Beta with a spinocerebellar lesion, which is option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1698829"}, {"introduction": "To truly grasp how the cerebellum facilitates motor learning, we must look at the level of synaptic plasticity. This problem [@problem_id:1698768] introduces a simplified computational model of how the brain learns to counteract a persistent motor perturbation, a process central to acquiring new skills. By analyzing this model, you will mathematically connect the concept of motor error to Long-Term Depression (LTD) in Purkinje cells, revealing the fundamental mechanism that allows the cerebellum to refine our movements.", "problem": "A neuroscientist proposes a simplified discrete-time model to understand cerebellar motor adaptation in response to a novel, persistent force field. The model describes the trial-by-trial adjustment of a motor task.\n\nThe model is defined by the following relationships:\n1.  A constant external perturbation, with a magnitude $\\Delta_{ext}$, is introduced, which would otherwise cause a persistent motor error.\n2.  The cerebellum generates a corrective motor output, $M_c$, on each trial to counteract this perturbation. The motor error, $E$, remaining on a given trial is the difference between the perturbation and the correction:\n    $$E = \\Delta_{ext} - M_c$$\n3.  The corrective output $M_c$ is determined by the synaptic weight, $w$, of a population of parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses. Due to the inhibitory nature of Purkinje cells on the pathways that generate correction, a weaker synapse (smaller $w$) leads to a stronger corrective output. This relationship is modeled as:\n    $$M_c = \\frac{A}{w + B}$$\n    Here, $A$ and $B$ are positive constants that encapsulate biophysical properties of the cerebellar circuit, and the weight $w$ is always a positive value.\n4.  Learning occurs through Long-Term Depression (LTD), a process that weakens active synapses in response to motor error. The synaptic weight on trial $n+1$ is updated from its value on trial $n$ according to the rule:\n    $$w_{n+1} = w_n - \\lambda E_n$$\n    where $E_n$ is the error on trial $n$ and $\\lambda$ is a small, positive learning rate parameter. The initial synaptic weight at the start of the task (trial $n=0$) is $w_0$.\n\nAssume a healthy subject performs this task for a sufficiently large number of trials, allowing the motor learning system to converge to a stable steady state. Determine the final, steady-state synaptic weight, $w_{ss}$. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $\\Delta_{ext}$, $A$, and $B$.", "solution": "We are given the discrete-time update rule for the synaptic weight $w_{n+1} = w_n - \\lambda E_n$, where $\\lambda>0$, and the error on trial $n$ is $E_n = \\Delta_{ext} - M_{c,n}$ with corrective output $M_{c,n} = \\frac{A}{w_n + B}$. At a steady state we require that the synaptic weight stops changing across trials. Thus, defining $w_{ss}$ as the steady-state weight, the fixed-point condition is\n$$\nw_{ss} = w_{ss} - \\lambda E_{ss}.\n$$\nBecause $\\lambda>0$, this implies\n$$\nE_{ss} = 0.\n$$\nUsing the error definition, steady-state zero error gives\n$$\n0 = \\Delta_{ext} - M_{c,ss} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad M_{c,ss} = \\Delta_{ext}.\n$$\nUsing the relationship between corrective output and synaptic weight at steady state,\n$$\nM_{c,ss} = \\frac{A}{w_{ss} + B} = \\Delta_{ext}.\n$$\nSolving for $w_{ss}$,\n$$\nw_{ss} + B = \\frac{A}{\\Delta_{ext}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad w_{ss} = \\frac{A}{\\Delta_{ext}} - B.\n$$\nSince $w$ is constrained to be positive, a feasible steady state requires $\\frac{A}{\\Delta_{ext}} - B > 0$, i.e., $A > B\\,\\Delta_{ext}$. Under the stated assumption that the system converges to a stable steady state for a healthy subject, we take parameters such that this condition holds, yielding the steady-state synaptic weight above.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{A}{\\Delta_{ext}}-B}$$", "id": "1698768"}]}
