This journey is exceptionally long and requires the bird to fly non-stop, relying entirely on its internal fat reserves for energy. Upon completing the flight, the bird has consumed a substantial portion of these reserves, and its final body mass, $m_f$, is found to be 40.0% less than its initial mass. Wing loading is a critical parameter in flight dynamics, defined as the body weight (mass multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity, $g$) divided by the total wing surface area, $A$. Assuming the bird's wing area $A$ remains constant throughout the flight, calculate the fractional decrease in the bird's wing loading. The fractional decrease is defined as the change in wing loading divided by the initial wing loading.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the fractional decrease in wing loading of a migratory bird. Let's denote the initial wing loading as $W_{L,i}$ and the final wing loading as $W_{L,f}$.\n\nFirst, we define the wing loading. It is given as the body weight divided by the total wing area. The weight is the mass times the acceleration due to gravity, $g$.\nThe initial wing loading is:\n$$W_{L,i} = \\frac{\\text{Initial Weight}}{\\text{Wing Area}} = \\frac{m_i g}{A}$$\nwhere $m_i$ is the initial mass and $A$ is the wing area.\n\nNext, we determine the final mass of the bird, $m_f$. The problem states that the bird's mass decreases by 40.0%. This means the final mass is 100% - 40.0% = 60.0% of the initial mass.\nMathematically, this can be written as:\n$$m_f = m_i - 0.400 m_i = (1 - 0.400) m_i = 0.600 m_i$$\n\nNow, we can find the final wing loading, $W_{L,f}$. Since the wing area $A$ is constant:\n$$W_{L,f} = \\frac{\\text{Final Weight}}{\\text{Wing Area}} = \\frac{m_f g}{A}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $m_f$:\n$$W_{L,f} = \\frac{(0.600 m_i) g}{A}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the fractional decrease in wing loading. The fractional decrease is defined as the absolute decrease ($W_{L,i} - W_{L,f}$) divided by the initial value ($W_{L,i}$).\n$$\\text{Fractional Decrease} = \\frac{W_{L,i} - W_{L,f}}{W_{L,i}}$$\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for $W_{L,i}$ and $W_{L,f}$ into this formula:\n$$\\text{Fractional Decrease} = \\frac{\\frac{m_i g}{A} - \\frac{0.600 m_i g}{A}}{\\frac{m_i g}{A}}$$\n\nWe can factor out the common term $\\frac{m_i g}{A}$ from the numerator:\n$$\\text{Fractional Decrease} = \\frac{\\frac{m_i g}{A} (1 - 0.600)}{\\frac{m_i g}{A}}$$\n\nThe term $\\frac{m_i g}{A}$ appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This shows that the fractional decrease in wing loading is independent of the bird's initial mass, wing area, and the local acceleration due to gravity.\n$$\\text{Fractional Decrease} = 1 - 0.600$$\n$$\\text{Fractional Decrease} = 0.400$$\n\nAlternatively, we can express the fractional decrease as $1 - \\frac{W_{L,f}}{W_{L,i}}$.\n$$ \\frac{W_{L,f}}{W_{L,i}} = \\frac{\\frac{0.600 m_i g}{A}}{\\frac{m_i g}{A}} = 0.600 $$\n$$\\text{Fractional Decrease} = 1 - 0.600 = 0.400$$\n\nThe fractional decrease in wing loading is 0.400.

They create a simplified model to predict how a calcium-deficient diet would disproportionately affect takeoff power versus gliding efficiency.\n\nConsider two birds, a normal bird (N) and a bird raised on a calcium-deficient diet (D). The model is based on the following parameters and assumptions:\n\n**Parameters:**\n- $f_s$: The fraction of a normal bird's total body mass that consists of its skeleton (e.g., if a bird is 20% skeleton by mass, $f_s = 0.20$).\n- $\\alpha$: A dimensionless factor ($0 < \\alpha < 1$) representing the reduction in maximum physiological muscle power output due to impaired Excitation-Contraction Coupling (ECC) kinetics in the deficient bird.
