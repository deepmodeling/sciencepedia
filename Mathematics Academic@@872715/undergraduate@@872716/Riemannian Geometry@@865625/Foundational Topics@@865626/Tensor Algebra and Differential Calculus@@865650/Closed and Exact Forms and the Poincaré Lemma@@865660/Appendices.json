The problem is a standard exercise in the calculus of differential forms on a Euclidean space. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first step is to determine if $\\omega$ is a closed form. A $1$-form $\\omega$ is defined as closed if its exterior derivative, $d\\omega$, is zero. For a $1$-form $\\omega = \\omega_x \\,dx + \\omega_y \\,dy$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the exterior derivative is defined as:\n$$ d\\omega = d(\\omega_x \\,dx + \\omega_y \\,dy) = d\\omega_x \\wedge dx + d\\omega_y \\wedge dy $$\nThe exterior derivatives of the component functions ($0$-forms) $\\omega_x$ and $\\omega_y$ are:\n$$ d\\omega_x = \\frac{\\partial \\omega_x}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial \\omega_x}{\\partial y} dy $$\n$$ d\\omega_y = \\frac{\\partial \\omega_y}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial \\omega_y}{\\partial y} dy $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $d\\omega$:\n$$ d\\omega = \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\omega_x}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial \\omega_x}{\\partial y} dy \\right) \\wedge dx + \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\omega_y}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial \\omega_y}{\\partial y} dy \\right) \\wedge dy $$\nUsing the anti-symmetric property of the wedge product ($dx \\wedge dy = -dy \\wedge dx$) and the fact that $dx \\wedge dx = 0$ and $dy \\wedge dy = 0$, we get:\n$$ d\\omega = \\frac{\\partial \\omega_x}{\\partial y} dy \\wedge dx + \\frac{\\partial \\omega_y}{\\partial x} dx \\wedge dy $$\n$$ d\\omega = \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\omega_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial \\omega_x}{\\partial y} \\right) dx \\wedge dy $$\nFor $\\omega$ to be closed, we must have $d\\omega=0$, which requires the coefficient of $dx \\wedge dy$ to be zero. This gives the condition:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\omega_y}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial \\omega_x}{\\partial y} $$\nThis is the comparison of mixed partial derivatives as requested in the problem.

Therefore, $d\\omega = 0$ and the form $\\omega$ is closed.\n\nNext, we use the Poincaré lemma to justify the existence of a potential function $u$. The Poincaré lemma states that on a contractible manifold, every closed differential form is exact. The manifold here is $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, which is contractible (it can be continuously deformed to a single point). Since $\\omega$ is a closed $1$-form on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the Poincaré lemma guarantees that $\\omega$ must also be an exact form.\n\nBy definition, a $1$-form $\\omega$ is exact if there exists a smooth function (a $0$-form) $u$, called a potential function, such that its exterior derivative $du$ is equal to $\\omega$. That is, $\\omega = du$. For a function $u(x,y)$, its exterior derivative is:\n$$ du = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} dy $$\nEquating $du$ with $\\omega$, we get the following system of partial differential equations for $u(x,y)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\omega_x = x^{2}-y \\quad (1) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\omega_y = y^{2}-x \\quad (2) $$\nTo find $u(x,y)$, we integrate equation $(1)$ with respect to $x$, treating $y$ as a constant:\n$$ u(x,y) = \\int (x^{2}-y) \\,dx = \\frac{x^{3}}{3} - xy + g(y) $$\nHere, $g(y)$ is an arbitrary function of $y$, which acts as the \"constant of integration\" with respect to $x$.\n\nTo determine $g(y)$, we differentiate this expression for $u(x,y)$ with respect to $y$ and compare it with equation $(2)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{x^{3}}{3} - xy + g(y)\\right) = -x + g'(y) $$\nwhere $g'(y) = \\frac{dg}{dy}$.\nFrom equation $(2)$, we know that $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = y^{2}-x$.

The quotient map is $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to T^2$.\n\n**1. Construction of the 2-form $\\omega$**\n\nWe begin by defining a differential form on the covering space $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Let $(u,v)$ be the standard coordinates on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. We are asked to consider a constant-coefficient $2$-form on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Let us define the $2$-form $\\Omega$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ by:\n$$\n\\Omega = du \\wedge dv\n$$\nThis is a $2$-form with the constant coefficient $1$.\n\nFor $\\Omega$ to descend to a well-defined $2$-form $\\omega$ on the quotient manifold $T^2$, it must be invariant under the action of the group $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. The action on points is given by the translation maps $T_{m,n}(u, v) = (u+m, v+n)$ for any $(m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$. We must verify that the pullback of $\\Omega$ under any such translation is $\\Omega$ itself, i.e., $T_{m,n}^* \\Omega = \\Omega$.\n\nLet $(u', v') = T_{m,n}(u, v) = (u+m, v+n)$. The differentials are $du' = d(u+m) = du$ and $dv' = d(v+n) = dv$. The pullback of the form is:\n$$\nT_{m,n}^* \\Omega = T_{m,n}^*(du \\wedge dv) = d(u \\circ T_{m,n}) \\wedge d(v \\circ T_{m,n}) = d(u+m) \\wedge d(v+n) = du \\wedge dv = \\Omega\n$$\nSince $\\Omega$ is invariant under all translations by elements of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, it descends to a unique, well-defined, smooth $2$-form $\\omega$ on $T^2$. This form $\\omega$ is defined by the property that its pullback to $\\mathbb{R}^2$ via the quotient map $\\pi$ is $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\pi^* \\omega = \\Omega = du \\wedge dv\n$$\n\n**2. Justification that $\\omega$ is closed**\n\nA differential form is defined as closed if its exterior derivative is zero. We need to show that $d\\omega = 0$. We will use the property that the exterior derivative operator $d$ commutes with pullback maps (naturality). For our quotient map $\\pi$, this means $d(\\pi^* \\omega) = \\pi^*(d\\omega)$.\n\nLet's compute the exterior derivative of $\\Omega = \\pi^*\\omega$:\n$$\nd\\Omega = d(du \\wedge dv)\n$$\nUsing the Leibniz rule for the exterior derivative, we have:\n$$\nd(du \\wedge dv) = d(du) \\wedge dv - du \\wedge d(dv)\n$$\nA fundamental property of the exterior derivative is that $d^2 = 0$. Applying this, we get $d(du) = 0$ and $d(dv) = 0$. Therefore,\n$$\nd\\Omega = 0 \\wedge dv - du \\wedge 0 = 0\n$$\nNow, using the naturality property:\n$$\n\\pi^*(d\\omega) = d(\\pi^*\\omega) = d\\Omega = 0\n$$\nThe map $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to T^2$ is a surjective local diffeomorphism. Its associated pullback map $\\pi^*$ on differential forms is injective. An injective map sends a non-zero element to a non-zero element, so if $\\pi^*(\\alpha) = 0$, it must be that $\\alpha = 0$. Applying this to our situation, since $\\pi^*(d\\omega) = 0$, we conclude that $d\\omega = 0$. Thus, the form $\\omega$ is closed.\n\n**3. Proof that $\\omega$ is not exact**\n\nA differential form is defined as exact if it is the exterior derivative of another differential form. To prove that $\\omega$ is not exact, we will argue by contradiction, using Stokes' Theorem.\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that $\\omega$ is an exact form. By definition, this means there exists a smooth $1$-form $\\alpha$ on $T^2$ such that $\\omega = d\\alpha$.\n\nThe two-torus $T^2$ is a compact, oriented manifold without boundary. The boundary of $T^2$, denoted $\\partial T^2$, is the empty set: $\\partial T^2 = \\emptyset$.\n\nStokes' Theorem states that for any smooth $(k-1)$-form $\\eta$ on an oriented $k$-dimensional manifold with boundary $M$, we have $\\int_M d\\eta = \\int_{\\partial M} \\eta$.\nLet's apply this theorem to our situation with $M=T^2$, $k=2$, and our form $\\omega = d\\alpha$.\n$$\n\\int_{T^2} \\omega = \\int_{T^2} d\\alpha\n$$\nAccording to Stokes' Theorem, this is equal to the integral of $\\alpha$ over the boundary of $T^2$:\n$$\n\\int_{T^2} d\\alpha = \\int_{\\partial T^2} \\alpha\n$$\nSince $\\partial T^2 = \\emptyset$, the integral over the empty set is zero:\n$$\n\\int_{\\partial T^2} \\alpha = 0\n$$\nTherefore, if $\\omega$ were an exact form, its integral over the entire manifold $T^2$ would have to be zero.\n$$\n\\int_{T^2} \\omega = 0\n$$\nTo complete the proof by contradiction, we must show that this integral is, in fact, non-zero. This is the object of the final part of the problem.\n\n**4. Computation of the integral $\\int_{T^2} \\omega$**\n\nTo compute the integral $\\int_{T^2} \\omega$, we can lift the integral to the covering space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and integrate over a fundamental domain. A fundamental domain for the action of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is the unit square $D = [0,1] \\times [0,1]$.\n\nThe integral of $\\omega$ over $T^2$ is equal to the integral of its pullback $\\pi^*\\omega = \\Omega$ over the fundamental domain $D$:\n$$\n\\int_{T^2} \\omega = \\int_{D} \\pi^* \\omega = \\int_{[0,1]\\times[0,1]} du \\wedge dv\n$$\nThe orientation on $T^2$ is induced by the standard ordered basis $(\\partial_u, \\partial_v)$, which corresponds to the orientation of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ given by the form $du \\wedge dv$. The integral is computed as a standard double integral over the unit square:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} \\int_{0}^{1} 1 \\, du \\, dv = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left[ u \\right]_{u=0}^{u=1} dv = \\int_{0}^{1} (1-0) \\, dv = \\int_{0}^{1} 1 \\, dv = \\left[ v \\right]_{v=0}^{v=1} = 1-0=1\n$$\nSo, we find that:\n$$\n\\int_{T^2} \\omega = 1\n$$\nSince $\\int_{T^2} \\omega = 1 \\neq 0$, our assumption in step 3 must be false. Therefore, $\\omega$ cannot be an exact form.\n\nIn summary, we have constructed a smooth $2$-form $\\omega$ on $T^2$ that is closed ($d\\omega=0$) but not exact, and we have computed its integral to be $1$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1} $$", "id": "3041257"}]}
