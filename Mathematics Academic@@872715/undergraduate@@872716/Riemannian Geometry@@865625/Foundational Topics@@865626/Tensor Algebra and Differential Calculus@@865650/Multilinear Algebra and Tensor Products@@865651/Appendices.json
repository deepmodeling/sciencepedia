It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. All terms are standard and well-defined. Therefore, the problem is valid and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $V = T_{p}M$ be an $n$-dimensional real vector space with a given ordered basis $\\left(e_{1},\\dots,e_{n}\\right)$. The dual space, denoted $V^{*}$, is the vector space of all linear functionals from $V$ to the field of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$. That is, $V^{*} = \\mathrm{Hom}\\!\\left(V, \\mathbb{R}\\right)$. An element $\\eta \\in V^{*}$ is a linear map $\\eta: V \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe first task is to construct the dual basis $\\left(\\varepsilon^{1},\\dots,\\varepsilon^{n}\\right)$ in $V^{*}$ corresponding to the basis $\\left(e_{1},\\dots,e_{n}\\right)$ of $V$. A basis for $V^{*}$ must consist of $n$ linearly independent linear functionals. A linear functional is uniquely determined by its values on a basis of its domain. We define the covector $\\varepsilon^{i} \\in V^{*}$ for each $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ by specifying its action on each basis vector $e_{j} \\in V$ as follows:\n$$\n\\varepsilon^{i}\\!\\left(e_{j}\\right) = \\delta^{i}_{j}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta^{i}_{j}$ is the Kronecker delta, defined as $\\delta^{i}_{j} = 1$ if $i=j$ and $\\delta^{i}_{j} = 0$ if $i \\neq j$.\nThis definition specifies the value of each $\\varepsilon^{i}$ on the basis vectors of $V$. By linearity, the action of $\\varepsilon^{i}$ on any arbitrary vector $v \\in V$ is also determined. Any $v \\in V$ has a unique expansion in the basis $\\left(e_{j}\\right)$ as $v = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} v^{j}e_{j}$ for some scalar components $v^{j} \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The action of $\\varepsilon^{i}$ on $v$ is then:\n$$\n\\varepsilon^{i}\\!\\left(v\\right) = \\varepsilon^{i}\\!\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} v^{j}e_{j}\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} v^{j}\\varepsilon^{i}\\!\\left(e_{j}\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} v^{j}\\delta^{i}_{j} = v^{i}\n$$\nThis shows that the functional $\\varepsilon^{i}$ acts on a vector $v$ to extract its $i$-th component in the basis $\\left(e_{j}\\right)$. The set of covectors $\\left(\\varepsilon^{1},\\dots,\\varepsilon^{n}\\right)$ forms a basis for $V^{*}$, known as the dual basis.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires us to consider the tensor $A = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\varepsilon^{i}\\otimes e_{i} \\in V^{*}\\otimes V$ and show that it corresponds to the identity endomorphism $\\mathrm{Id}_{V} \\in \\mathrm{End}\\!\\left(V\\right)$ under the canonical isomorphism between $V^{*}\\otimes V$ and $\\mathrm{End}\\!\\left(V\\right)$. The space $\\mathrm{End}\\!\\left(V\\right)$ is the space of linear maps from $V$ to itself. The canonical isomorphism $\\Phi: V^{*}\\otimes V \\to \\mathrm{End}\\!\\left(V\\right)$ is defined on a simple tensor $\\eta \\otimes w \\in V^{*}\\otimes V$ (with $\\eta \\in V^{*}$ and $w \\in V$) by its action on a vector $v \\in V$:\n$$\n\\left(\\Phi(\\eta \\otimes w)\\right)\\!\\left(v\\right) = \\eta(v)w\n$$\nThe value $\\eta(v)$ is a scalar, so the result $\\eta(v)w$ is a vector in $V$, as required for an endomorphism. This map is extended by linearity to all tensors in $V^{*}\\otimes V$. Let's apply this to the given tensor $A = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\varepsilon^{i}\\otimes e_{i}$. The corresponding endomorphism is $L_{A} = \\Phi(A) \\in \\mathrm{End}\\!\\left(V\\right)$. To identify which endomorphism $L_{A}$ is, we examine its action on an arbitrary vector $v \\in V$. Using the linearity of $\\Phi$:\n$$\nL_{A}(v) = \\left(\\Phi\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\varepsilon^{i}\\otimes e_{i}\\right)\\right)\\!\\left(v\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(\\Phi(\\varepsilon^{i}\\otimes e_{i})\\right)\\!\\left(v\\right)\n$$\nUsing the definition of the evaluation map $\\Phi$:\n$$\nL_{A}(v) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\varepsilon^{i}(v)e_{i}\n$$\nAs established earlier, for any vector $v$ with component expansion $v = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} v^{j}e_{j}$, the action of the dual basis functional $\\varepsilon^{i}$ is $\\varepsilon^{i}(v) = v^{i}$. Substituting this result into the expression for $L_{A}(v)$:\n$$\nL_{A}(v) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v^{i}e_{i}\n$$\nThe expression $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} v^{i}e_{i}$ is the original expansion of the vector $v$. Therefore, we have shown that for any $v \\in V$:\n$$\nL_{A}(v) = v\n$$\nThis is the definition of the identity endomorphism on $V$, commonly denoted $\\mathrm{Id}_{V}$. Thus, the tensor $A$ represents the identity map.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the value of the canonical pairing $\\varepsilon^{i}\\!\\left(e_{j}\\right)$, expressed as a single closed-form analytic expression. The canonical pairing between a vector space and its dual is simply the evaluation of a functional on a vector. In this case, it is the evaluation of the dual basis covector $\\varepsilon^{i}$ on the basis vector $e_{j}$. As per the very definition used to construct the dual basis, this value is given by the Kronecker delta symbol:\n$$\n\\varepsilon^{i}\\!\\left(e_{j}\\right) = \\delta^{i}_{j}\n$$\nThe Kronecker delta $\\delta^{i}_{j}$ is a function of two integer indices $i$ and $j$ from the set $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. It is defined to be $1$ if the indices are equal ($i=j$) and $0$ if they are not ($i \\neq j$).

The problem is well-posed, as all necessary information is provided to compute a unique numerical result. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a formalizable, self-contained, and consistent problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for two things: first, an explanation and illustration of the relationship between a tensor and its components, and second, the evaluation of the tensor $C_p$ on three specific vectors $u$, $v$, and $w$.\n\nA covariant tensor of rank $k$, such as $C_p$ which has rank $3$, is a multilinear map from $k$ copies of the tangent space $T_p M$ to the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$. The components of such a tensor in a given basis $\\{e_i\\}$ are, by definition, the values the tensor takes when its arguments are the basis vectors. This is what is meant by \"the components $C_{ijk}$ are defined by the values of $C_{p}$ on ordered triples of basis vectors\". Formally, this defining relationship is:\n$$ C_{ijk} := C_p(e_i, e_j, e_k) $$\nThis relation holds for any $i, j, k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nTo illustrate this with the given tensor components $C_{ijk} = \\epsilon_{ijk} + \\delta_{ij}\\,\\delta_{k1}$, we evaluate two examples as requested.\nFor the first example, we compute $C_p(e_1, e_2, e_3)$:\n$$ C_p(e_1, e_2, e_3) = C_{123} $$\nUsing the given formula for the components:\n$$ C_{123} = \\epsilon_{123} + \\delta_{12}\\,\\delta_{31} $$\nBy definition, $\\epsilon_{123} = 1$. The Kronecker deltas are $\\delta_{12} = 0$ (since $1 \\neq 2$) and $\\delta_{31} = 0$ (since $3 \\neq 1$). Therefore:\n$$ C_{123} = 1 + (0)(0) = 1 $$\nSo, $C_p(e_1, e_2, e_3) = 1$.\n\nFor the second example, we compute $C_p(e_2, e_2, e_1)$:\n$$ C_p(e_2, e_2, e_1) = C_{221} $$\nUsing the formula for the components:\n$$ C_{221} = \\epsilon_{221} + \\delta_{22}\\,\\delta_{11} $$\nThe Levi-Civita symbol $\\epsilon_{ijk}$ is totally antisymmetric, which implies it is zero if any two indices are repeated. Thus, $\\epsilon_{221} = 0$. The Kronecker deltas are $\\delta_{22} = 1$ and $\\delta_{11} = 1$. Therefore:\n$$ C_{221} = 0 + (1)(1) = 1 $$\nSo, $C_p(e_2, e_2, e_1) = 1$.\n\nNow, we proceed to compute $C_p(u, v, w)$ for the given vectors:\n$$ u = 2\\,e_{1} - 1\\,e_{2} + 3\\,e_{3} $$\n$$ v = 0\\,e_{1} + 4\\,e_{2} + 1\\,e_{3} $$\n$$ w = -2\\,e_{1} + 5\\,e_{2} + 1\\,e_{3} $$\nThe components of these vectors in the basis $\\{e_i\\}$ are:\n$$ u^1=2, \\; u^2=-1, \\; u^3=3 $$\n$$ v^1=0, \\; v^2=4, \\; v^3=1 $$\n$$ w^1=-2, \\; w^2=5, \\; w^3=1 $$\nSince $C_p$ is a trilinear map, we can expand its evaluation on $u,v,w$ as follows:\n$$ C_p(u, v, w) = C_p\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^3 u^i e_i, \\sum_{j=1}^3 v^j e_j, \\sum_{k=1}^3 w^k e_k\\right) $$\nBy trilinearity, we can pull out the summations and the scalar components $u^i, v^j, w^k$:\n$$ C_p(u, v, w) = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\sum_{k=1}^3 u^i v^j w^k C_p(e_i, e_j, e_k) $$\nUsing the definition $C_p(e_i, e_j, e_k) = C_{ijk}$, we get the standard formula for evaluating a tensor in components:\n$$ C_p(u, v, w) = \\sum_{i,j,k=1}^3 u^i v^j w^k C_{ijk} $$\nNow we substitute the given expression for $C_{ijk}$:\n$$ C_p(u, v, w) = \\sum_{i,j,k=1}^3 u^i v^j w^k (\\epsilon_{ijk} + \\delta_{ij}\\,\\delta_{k1}) $$\nWe can split this into two sums:\n$$ C_p(u, v, w) = \\sum_{i,j,k=1}^3 u^i v^j w^k \\epsilon_{ijk} + \\sum_{i,j,k=1}^3 u^i v^j w^k \\delta_{ij}\\,\\delta_{k1} $$\n\nLet's evaluate each term separately.\nThe first term is the definition of the determinant of the matrix formed by the component vectors $u, v, w$:\n$$ \\sum_{i,j,k=1}^3 u^i v^j w^k \\epsilon_{ijk} = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} u^1 & u^2 & u^3 \\\\ v^1 & v^2 & v^3 \\\\ w^1 & w^2 & w^3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 4 & 1 \\\\ -2 & 5 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nLet's compute this determinant by cofactor expansion along the first row:\n$$ = 2 \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\\\ 5 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} - (-1) \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} + 3 \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 4 \\\\ -2 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ = 2(4 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot 5) + 1(0 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot (-2)) + 3(0 \\cdot 5 - 4 \\cdot (-2)) $$\n$$ = 2(4 - 5) + 1(0 + 2) + 3(0 + 8) $$\n$$ = 2(-1) + 1(2) + 3(8) $$\n$$ = -2 + 2 + 24 = 24 $$\n\nThe second term involves Kronecker deltas, which simplify the summation.\n$$ \\sum_{i,j,k=1}^3 u^i v^j w^k \\delta_{ij}\\,\\delta_{k1} $$\nThe $\\delta_{k1}$ term forces $k=1$, collapsing the sum over $k$:\n$$ = \\sum_{i,j=1}^3 u^i v^j w^1 \\delta_{ij} $$\nThe $\\delta_{ij}$ term forces $j=i$, collapsing the sum over $j$:\n$$ = \\sum_{i=1}^3 u^i v^i w^1 $$\nThis is the Euclidean dot product of $u$ and $v$, multiplied by the component $w^1$:\n$$ = (u^1 v^1 + u^2 v^2 + u^3 v^3) w^1 $$\nSubstituting the component values:\n$$ = ((2)(0) + (-1)(4) + (3)(1))(-2) $$\n$$ = (0 - 4 + 3)(-2) $$\n$$ = (-1)(-2) = 2 $$\n\nFinally, we sum the two terms to get the value of $C_p(u, v, w)$:\n$$ C_p(u, v, w) = 24 + 2 = 26 $$\nThe final value is a single real number as expected.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{26}\n$$", "id": "3059788"}, {"introduction": "A special and highly important class of tensors are the alternating tensors, also known as differential forms in the context of manifolds.
