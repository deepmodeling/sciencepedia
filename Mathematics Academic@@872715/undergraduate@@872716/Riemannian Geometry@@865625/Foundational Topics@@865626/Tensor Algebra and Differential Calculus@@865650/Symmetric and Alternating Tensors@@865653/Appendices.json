We are given two vectors $u, v \\in V$ with coordinate representations $u = a e_1 + b e_2$ and $v = c e_1 + d e_2$ for some scalars $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nWe are also given a bilinear form $B: V \\times V \\to \\mathbb{R}$. The matrix representation of $B$ with respect to the basis $\\{e_1, e_2\\}$ is given as:\n$$\n[B] = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nBy the foundational definition of the matrix of a bilinear form, the entries $B_{ij}$ are the values of the form on the basis vectors: $B_{ij} = B(e_i, e_j)$. Therefore, we have:\n$B(e_1, e_1) = 2$\n$B(e_1, e_2) = 1$\n$B(e_2, e_1) = 1$\n$B(e_2, e_2) = 3$\n\nThe problem requires the computation of $B(u, v)$ using only the definition that $B$ is linear in each of its arguments.\n\nFirst, we express $B(u, v)$ using the coordinate representations of $u$ and $v$:\n$$\nB(u, v) = B(a e_1 + b e_2, c e_1 + d e_2)\n$$\nUsing the linearity of $B$ in the first argument, we can expand this expression:\n$$\nB(a e_1 + b e_2, c e_1 + d e_2) = B(a e_1, c e_1 + d e_2) + B(b e_2, c e_1 + d e_2)\n$$\nApplying the scalar multiplication property of linearity in the first argument, we get:\n$$\n= a B(e_1, c e_1 + d e_2) + b B(e_2, c e_1 + d e_2)\n$$\nNext, we apply the linearity of $B$ in the second argument to each of the two terms:\n$$\na B(e_1, c e_1 + d e_2) = a \\left( B(e_1, c e_1) + B(e_1, d e_2) \\right) = a \\left( c B(e_1, e_1) + d B(e_1, e_2) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nb B(e_2, c e_1 + d e_2) = b \\left( B(e_2, c e_1) + B(e_2, d e_2) \\right) = b \\left( c B(e_2, e_1) + d B(e_2, e_2) \\right)\n$$\nCombining these expanded terms, we obtain the full expansion of $B(u, v)$:\n$$\nB(u, v) = a c B(e_1, e_1) + a d B(e_1, e_2) + b c B(e_2, e_1) + b d B(e_2, e_2)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given values for $B(e_i, e_j)$ from the matrix $[B]$:\n$$\nB(u, v) = a c (2) + a d (1) + b c (1) + b d (3)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the explicit formula for $B(u, v)$ in terms of the coordinates $a, b, c, d$:\n$$\nB(u, v) = 2ac + ad + bc + 3bd\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must verify that $B(u, v) = B(v, u)$ using the same foundational definitions. We start by computing $B(v, u)$.

The transformation relating them is given by the rotation matrix $R$. The new basis vectors are expressed in terms of the old basis vectors as:\n$$\ne'_j = \\sum_{i=1}^3 R^i_{\\;j} e_i\n$$\nwhere $R^i_{\\;j}$ are the elements of the matrix $R$. A tensor is a geometric object, and its value is independent of the basis used to express it. For a $(0,2)$-tensor $B$ and two vectors $v, w \\in V$, we have $B(v,w)$. Let the components of the vectors be $v^i$ and $w^j$ in the $\\{e_i\\}$ basis and $v'^k$ and $w'^l$ in the $\\{e'_j\\}$ basis. The vectors themselves are invariant: $v = v^i e_i = v'^j e'_j$. This implies a transformation law for the components: $v^i = \\sum_j R^i_{\\;j} v'^j$.\n\nThe value of the tensor acting on the vectors is also invariant:\n$$\nB(v,w) = B_{ij} v^i w^j = B'_{kl} v'^k w'^l\n$$\nSubstituting the transformation for the vector components into the expression in the unprimed basis:\n$$\nB_{ij} \\left(\\sum_k R^i_{\\;k} v'^k\\right) \\left(\\sum_l R^j_{\\;l} w'^l\\right) = \\sum_{k,l} \\left(\\sum_{i,j} B_{ij} R^i_{\\;k} R^j_{\\;l}\\right) v'^k w'^l\n$$\nComparing this with $B'_{kl} v'^k w'^l$, we deduce the transformation law for the components of a $(0,2)$-tensor:\n$$\nB'_{kl} = \\sum_{i,j} R^i_{\\;k} R^j_{\\;l} B_{ij}\n$$\nThis can be written in matrix notation. Let $B_{comp}$ and $B'_{comp}$ be the matrices of components $(B_{ij})$ and $(B'_{kl})$ respectively. The transformation rule is $B'_{comp} = R^T B_{comp} R$.\n\nNow we show that symmetry and alternation are preserved under this transformation.\nLet $S$ be a symmetric $(0,2)$-tensor, with components $S_{ij} = S_{ji}$. Its components in the primed basis are $S'_{kl} = \\sum_{i,j} R^i_{\\;k} R^j_{\\;l} S_{ij}$. We check if $S'_{kl}$ is symmetric in its indices $k, l$:\n$$\nS'_{lk} = \\sum_{i,j} R^i_{\\;l} R^j_{\\;k} S_{ij}\n$$\nSince $S_{ij} = S_{ji}$, we can swap the summation indices $i$ and $j$:\n$$\nS'_{lk} = \\sum_{j,i} R^j_{\\;l} R^i_{\\;k} S_{ji}\n$$\nRenaming the dummy indices ($j \\to i$, $i \\to j$) and reordering the terms, we get:\n$$\nS'_{lk} = \\sum_{i,j} R^i_{\\;l} R^j_{\\;k} S_{ij} = \\sum_{i,j} R^j_{\\;k} R^i_{\\;l} S_{ij} = S'_{kl}\n$$\nThus, $S'$ is symmetric. Symmetry is a coordinate-independent property.\n\nLet $A$ be an alternating $(0,2)$-tensor, with components $A_{ij} = -A_{ji}$. Its transformed components are $A'_{kl} = \\sum_{i,j} R^i_{\\;k} R^j_{\\;l} A_{ij}$. We check if $A'_{kl}$ is alternating:\n$$\nA'_{lk} = \\sum_{i,j} R^i_{\\;l} R^j_{\\;k} A_{ij}\n$$\nUsing $A_{ij} = -A_{ji}$ and swapping summation indices $i, j$:\n$$\nA'_{lk} = \\sum_{j,i} R^j_{\\;l} R^i_{\\;k} A_{ji} = \\sum_{j,i} R^j_{\\;l} R^i_{\\;k} (-A_{ij})\n$$\nRenaming dummy indices ($j \\to i$, $i \\to j$) and reordering:\n$$\nA'_{lk} = -\\sum_{i,j} R^i_{\\;l} R^j_{\\;k} A_{ij} = -\\sum_{i,j} R^j_{\\;k} R^i_{\\;l} A_{ij} = -A'_{kl}\n$$\nThus, $A'$ is alternating. Alternation is also a coordinate-independent property.\nThis shows that applying the symmetrization or alternation operations commutes with a change of basis. Therefore, the symmetric part of $B$ in one basis transforms to the symmetric part of the transformed tensor $B'$ in the new basis, and similarly for the alternating part.\n\n3) Computation of the squared norm of the alternating part.\n\nThe squared norm of the alternating part $B_{[ij]}$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\|B_{[\\,\\cdot\\,\\cdot\\,]}\\|^{2} := g^{ik}g^{jl}B_{[ij]}B_{[kl]}\n$$\nThe problem states that we are in an orthonormal basis $\\{e_i\\}$, in which the metric components are $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$. The matrix of components of the contravariant metric tensor, $g^{ij}$, is the inverse of the matrix of $g_{ij}$. Since the matrix $(g_{ij})$ is the identity matrix $I$, its inverse is also the identity matrix. Thus, $g^{ij} = \\delta^{ij}$, where $\\delta^{ij}$ are the components of the identity matrix (numerically same as $\\delta_{ij}$).\n\nSubstituting $g^{ik} = \\delta^{ik}$ and $g^{jl} = \\delta^{jl}$ into the norm definition:\n$$\n\\|B_{[\\,\\cdot\\,\\cdot\\,]}\\|^{2} = \\delta^{ik}\\delta^{jl}B_{[ij]}B_{[kl]}\n$$\nThe summation is over all four indices $i,j,k,l$. The Kronecker deltas simplify the sum. The term $\\delta^{ik}$ is non-zero (equal to $1$) only when $k=i$. Summing over $k$:\n$$\n\\|B_{[\\,\\cdot\\,\\cdot\\,]}\\|^{2} = \\sum_{i,j,l} \\delta^{jl}B_{[ij]}B_{[il]}\n$$\nSimilarly, the term $\\delta^{jl}$ is non-zero (equal to $1$) only when $l=j$. Summing over $l$:\n$$\n\\|B_{[\\,\\cdot\\,\\cdot\\,]}\\|^{2} = \\sum_{i,j} B_{[ij]}B_{[ij]} = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\sum_{j=1}^3 (B_{[ij]})^2\n$$\nThis is the sum of the squares of all the components of the matrix for $B_{[ij]}$. From part (1), we have:\n$$\n(B_{[ij]}) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 4 \\\\\n1 & -4 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe sum of the squares of these components is:\n$$\n\\|B_{[\\,\\cdot\\,\\cdot\\,]}\\|^{2} = (0)^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1)^2 + (1)^2 + (0)^2 + (4)^2 + (1)^2 + (-4)^2 + (0)^2\n$$\n$$\n\\|B_{[\\,\\cdot\\,\\cdot\\,]}\\|^{2} = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 16 + 1 + 16 + 0\n$$\n$$\n\\|B_{[\\,\\cdot\\,\\cdot\\,]}\\|^{2} = 36\n$$\nThe squared norm is a scalar invariant, meaning its value does not depend on the choice of orthonormal basis.
