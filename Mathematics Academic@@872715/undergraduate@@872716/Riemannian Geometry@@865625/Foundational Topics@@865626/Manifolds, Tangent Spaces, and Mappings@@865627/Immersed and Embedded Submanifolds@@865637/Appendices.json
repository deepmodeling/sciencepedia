It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and objective. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe ambient manifold is the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with its standard metric $\\overline{g}$, which in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ is $\\overline{g} = dx^2 + dy^2$. The Levi-Civita connection $\\overline{\\nabla}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is the flat connection, meaning the covariant derivative is the standard directional derivative and all Christoffel symbols are zero in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe embedded curve $M \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is given locally by the parametrization $\\gamma: I \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$, $\\gamma(t) = (t, t^3)$. We use $t$ as the local coordinate on $M$.\n\n**1. Induced Metric and Levi-Civita Connection on M**\n\nThe tangent vector field to the curve $M$ is given by the derivative of the parametrization. In the local coordinate $t$, the basis for the tangent space $T_{\\gamma(t)}M$ is $\\partial_t$, which corresponds to the vector $\\gamma'(t)$ in the ambient space.\n$$\n\\partial_t \\equiv \\gamma'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(t, t^3) = (1, 3t^2)\n$$\nIn the standard basis $\\{\\partial_x, \\partial_y\\}$ of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, this is $\\partial_t = 1\\cdot\\partial_x + 3t^2\\cdot\\partial_y$.\n\nThe induced metric $g_M$ on $M$ is the pullback of the ambient metric $\\overline{g}$. In the local coordinate $t$, its single component $g_{11}(t)$ is:\n$$\ng_{11}(t) = \\overline{g}(\\partial_t, \\partial_t) = \\langle \\gamma'(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle_{\\mathbb{R}^2} = 1^2 + (3t^2)^2 = 1 + 9t^4\n$$\nSo the induced metric tensor on $M$ is $g_M = (1+9t^4)dt^2$.\n\nThe Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla^M$ on $M$ is determined by the Gauss formula, which relates the ambient connection $\\overline{\\nabla}$ to the induced connection $\\nabla^M$ and the second fundamental form $II$:\n$$\n\\overline{\\nabla}_{X} Y = (\\nabla^M_{X} Y) + II(X,Y)\n$$\nfor vector fields $X, Y$ tangent to $M$. The term $\\nabla^M_{X} Y$ is the orthogonal projection of $\\overline{\\nabla}_{X} Y$ onto the tangent space of $M$. We compute the Christoffel symbol $(\\Gamma^M)^1_{11}$ of the connection $\\nabla^M$. We need to compute $\\nabla^M_{\\partial_t} \\partial_t$.\nFirst, we find $\\overline{\\nabla}_{\\partial_t} \\partial_t$. Since the ambient connection is flat, this is simply the derivative of the vector field $\\gamma'(t)$ with respect to $t$.\n$$\n\\overline{\\nabla}_{\\partial_t} \\partial_t = \\frac{d}{dt} \\gamma'(t) = \\gamma''(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(1, 3t^2) = (0, 6t)\n$$\nNow, we project this vector onto the tangent space $T_{\\gamma(t)}M$, which is spanned by $\\partial_t = \\gamma'(t) = (1, 3t^2)$. The projection is:\n$$\n\\nabla^M_{\\partial_t} \\partial_t = (\\overline{\\nabla}_{\\partial_t} \\partial_t)^T = \\frac{\\langle \\gamma''(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle}{\\langle \\gamma'(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle} \\gamma'(t)\n$$\nThe inner products are:\n$$\n\\langle \\gamma''(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle = \\langle (0, 6t), (1, 3t^2) \\rangle = (0)(1) + (6t)(3t^2) = 18t^3\n$$\n$$\n\\langle \\gamma'(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle = g_{11}(t) = 1+9t^4\n$$\nSo, the tangential component is:\n$$\n\\nabla^M_{\\partial_t} \\partial_t = \\frac{18t^3}{1+9t^4} \\gamma'(t) = \\frac{18t^3}{1+9t^4} \\partial_t\n$$\nBy definition, $\\nabla^M_{\\partial_t} \\partial_t = (\\Gamma^M)^1_{11} \\partial_t$. Thus, the only non-trivial Christoffel symbol of the induced connection is:\n$$\n(\\Gamma^M)^1_{11} = \\frac{18t^3}{1+9t^4}\n$$\n\n**2. Second Fundamental Form**\n\nThe second fundamental form $II(\\partial_t, \\partial_t)$ is the normal component of $\\overline{\\nabla}_{\\partial_t} \\partial_t$:\n$$\nII(\\partial_t, \\partial_t) = (\\overline{\\nabla}_{\\partial_t} \\partial_t)^N = \\overline{\\nabla}_{\\partial_t} \\partial_t - \\nabla^M_{\\partial_t} \\partial_t = \\gamma''(t) - \\frac{18t^3}{1+9t^4} \\gamma'(t)\n$$\nSubstituting the vectors:\n$$\nII(\\partial_t, \\partial_t) = (0, 6t) - \\frac{18t^3}{1+9t^4}(1, 3t^2) = \\left(-\\frac{18t^3}{1+9t^4}, 6t - \\frac{54t^5}{1+9t^4}\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the second component:\n$$\n6t - \\frac{54t^5}{1+9t^4} = \\frac{6t(1+9t^4) - 54t^5}{1+9t^4} = \\frac{6t+54t^5-54t^5}{1+9t^4} = \\frac{6t}{1+9t^4}\n$$\nSo, the vector-valued second fundamental form is:\n$$\nII(\\partial_t, \\partial_t) = \\left(-\\frac{18t^3}{1+9t^4}, \\frac{6t}{1+9t^4}\\right) = \\frac{6t}{1+9t^4}(-3t^2, 1)\n$$\nA normal vector to $\\gamma'(t)=(1, 3t^2)$ is $(-3t^2, 1)$. A unit normal vector field $N(t)$ is:\n$$\nN(t) = \\frac{(-3t^2, 1)}{\\sqrt{(-3t^2)^2 + 1^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+9t^4}}(-3t^2, 1)\n$$\nThe scalar second fundamental form $h$ has component $h_{11}$ defined by $II(\\partial_t, \\partial_t) = h_{11} N(t)$. Alternatively, $h_{11} = \\langle \\gamma''(t), N(t) \\rangle$.\n$$\nh_{11} = \\langle (0, 6t), \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+9t^4}}(-3t^2, 1) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+9t^4}}((0)(-3t^2) + (6t)(1)) = \\frac{6t}{\\sqrt{1+9t^4}}\n$$\n\n**3. Gauss Equation**\n\nThe Gauss equation relates the Riemann curvature tensors of $M$ ($R$) and $\\mathbb{R}^2$ ($\\overline{R}$):\n$$\n\\overline{g}(\\overline{R}(X,Y)Z,W) = g_M(R(X,Y)Z,W) - (\\overline{g}(II(X,Z),II(Y,W)) - \\overline{g}(II(X,W),II(Y,Z)))\n$$\nIn local coordinates, using $X=Y=Z=W = \\partial_t$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\overline{R}_{1111} = R_{1111} - (h_{11}h_{11} - h_{11}h_{11})\n$$\nThe ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is flat, so its curvature tensor is identically zero, $\\overline{R}=0$.\nThe submanifold $M$ is one-dimensional. Any one-dimensional Riemannian manifold is intrinsically flat, so its Riemann curvature tensor is also identically zero, $R=0$.\nThe equation thus reduces to:\n$$\n0 = 0 - (h_{11}^2 - h_{11}^2) \\implies 0=0\n$$\nThe Gauss equation is trivially verified.\n\n**4. Curve Curvature and its Relation to the Second Fundamental Form**\n\nThe curvature $\\kappa$ of a plane curve is the magnitude of the rate of change of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length. The acceleration vector $\\gamma''(t)$ can be decomposed into tangential and normal components:\n$$\n\\gamma''(t) = \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2}T(t) + \\kappa_g(t) \\left(\\frac{ds}{dt}\\right)^2 N(t)\n$$\nwhere $s$ is the arc-length parameter, $T$ is the unit tangent vector, $N$ is the unit normal vector, and $\\kappa_g$ is the signed curvature. The curvature is $\\kappa = |\\kappa_g|$.\n\nFrom the Gauss formula, we have $\\gamma''(t) = \\overline{\\nabla}_{\\partial_t}\\partial_t = \\nabla^M_{\\partial_t}\\partial_t + II(\\partial_t, \\partial_t)$.\nComparing the two decompositions of $\\gamma''(t)$, we identify the normal component:\n$$\nII(\\partial_t,\\partial_t) = \\kappa_g \\left(\\frac{ds}{dt}\\right)^2 N\n$$\nThe speed is $\\frac{ds}{dt} = |\\gamma'(t)| = \\sqrt{g_{11}}$. Therefore, $(\\frac{ds}{dt})^2 = g_{11}$.\nThe vector $II(\\partial_t, \\partial_t)$ is also given by $h_{11}N$.\nEquating the two expressions for the normal component gives:\n$$\nh_{11} N = \\kappa_g g_{11} N \\implies h_{11} = \\kappa_g g_{11}\n$$\nThis provides the direct relationship between the second fundamental form, the metric, and the curvature. We can solve for the curvature $\\kappa$:\n$$\n\\kappa(t) = |\\kappa_g(t)| = \\frac{|h_{11}(t)|}{g_{11}(t)}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions we derived for $h_{11}(t)$ and $g_{11}(t)$:\n$$\nh_{11}(t) = \\frac{6t}{\\sqrt{1+9t^4}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad g_{11}(t) = 1+9t^4\n$$\n$$\n\\kappa(t) = \\frac{\\left|\\frac{6t}{\\sqrt{1+9t^4}}\\right|}{1+9t^4} = \\frac{|6t|}{(1+9t^4)\\sqrt{1+9t^4}} = \\frac{|6t|}{(1+9t^4)^{3/2}}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the curvature of the curve $\\gamma(t)$ as a function of $t$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{|6t|}{(1+9t^4)^{3/2}}}\n$$", "id": "3050701"}, {"introduction": "A smooth map can be a local diffeomorphism at every point without being globally one-to-one, and this distinction is at the heart of the difference between an immersion and an embedding.

To verify that $\\gamma$ is an immersion, we must show that its differential $d\\gamma_{t}:T_{t}\\mathbb{S}^{1}\\to T_{\\gamma(t)}\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is injective for all $t\\in\\mathbb{S}^{1}$. The tangent space $T_{t}\\mathbb{S}^{1}$ is a $1$-dimensional vector space spanned by the tangent vector $\\frac{d}{dt}$. The differential $d\\gamma_t$ maps this basis vector to the velocity vector $\\gamma'(t)$ in $T_{\\gamma(t)}\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, which we identify with $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The map $d\\gamma_t$ is injective if and only if $\\gamma'(t) \\neq (0,0)$.\n\nWe compute the derivative of $\\gamma(t)$:\n$$\n\\gamma'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} (\\sin t, \\sin 2t) = (\\cos t, 2\\cos 2t)\n$$\nFor $d\\gamma_t$ to fail to be injective, we would need $\\gamma'(t)=(0,0)$, which requires both components to be zero simultaneously:\n$$\n\\cos t = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2\\cos 2t = 0\n$$\nThe first equation, $\\cos t=0$, holds for $t = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi$ for any integer $k$. We must check if the second equation holds for these values of $t$. Using the double-angle identity $\\cos 2t = 2\\cos^2 t - 1$, we see that if $\\cos t = 0$, then:\n$$\n\\cos 2t = 2(0)^2 - 1 = -1\n$$\nSo, when $\\cos t = 0$, the second component of the derivative is $2\\cos 2t = 2(-1) = -2 \\neq 0$. The two components of $\\gamma'(t)$ are never simultaneously zero. Thus, $\\gamma'(t) \\neq (0,0)$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{S}^1$. This proves that the differential $d\\gamma_t$ is injective for all $t$, and therefore $\\gamma$ is an immersion.\n\n2. The constant rank theorem states that if a smooth map between manifolds has constant rank in a neighborhood of a point, its local form is particularly simple. As shown in part 1, the rank of the differential $d\\gamma_t$ is the dimension of the image of the tangent space $T_{t}\\mathbb{S}^{1}$, which is a $1$-dimensional space. Since $d\\gamma_t$ is injective for all $t$, the dimension of its image is always $1$. Therefore, the rank of $\\gamma$ is constant and equal to $1$ everywhere on $\\mathbb{S}^1$.\n\nBy the specialization of the constant rank theorem for immersions, for every $t_0 \\in \\mathbb{S}^1$, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $t_0$ in $\\mathbb{S}^1$ and a chart $(V, \\phi)$ for $\\mathbb{R}^2$ around $\\gamma(t_0)$ such that $\\gamma(U) \\subset V$ and the map $\\phi \\circ \\gamma$ on $U$ is given by $t \\mapsto (t, 0)$ (in appropriate local coordinates). A map that can be locally represented this way is a local embedding. An embedding is an immersion that is also a homeomorphism onto its image. Since $\\gamma$ is locally equivalent to a standard inclusion map, which is a homeomorphism onto its image, $\\gamma$ is a homeomorphism from a sufficiently small neighborhood of any point $t \\in \\mathbb{S}^1$ to its image $\\gamma(U) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$. A homeomorphism is by definition injective, so $\\gamma$ must be locally injective.\n\n3. To show that $\\gamma$ is not globally injective, we need to find distinct points $t, s \\in \\mathbb{S}^1$ (i.e., $t \\not\\equiv s \\pmod{2\\pi}$) such that $\\gamma(t) = \\gamma(s)$. This requires solving the system of equations:\n$$\n\\sin t = \\sin s\n$$\n$$\n\\sin 2t = \\sin 2s\n$$\nFor $t,s$ in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$ with $t \\neq s$, the first equation $\\sin t = \\sin s$ implies $s = \\pi - t$. Substituting this into the second equation:\n$$\n\\sin(2(\\pi-t)) = \\sin(2\\pi - 2t) = -\\sin(2t)\n$$\nThe second equation then becomes $\\sin(2t) = -\\sin(2t)$, which simplifies to $2\\sin(2t) = 0$, or $\\sin(2t)=0$. This condition is satisfied when $2t = k\\pi$ for some integer $k$, which means $t = k\\pi/2$.\n\nLet's test these values for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$:\n- If $t=0$, then $s = \\pi-0 = \\pi$. We have $\\gamma(0) = (\\sin 0, \\sin 0) = (0,0)$ and $\\gamma(\\pi) = (\\sin \\pi, \\sin 2\\pi) = (0,0)$. Since $0 \\neq \\pi$ in $\\mathbb{S}^1$, we have found distinct points with the same image.\n- If $t=\\pi/2$, then $s = \\pi - \\pi/2 = \\pi/2$, so $s=t$, which is not a pair of distinct points.\n- If $t=\\pi$, then $s = \\pi - \\pi = 0$, which is the same pair as the first case.\n- If $t=3\\pi/2$, then $s = \\pi - 3\\pi/2 = -\\pi/2$, which is equivalent to $3\\pi/2 \\pmod{2\\pi}$, so $s=t$.\n\nThus, $\\gamma(0) = \\gamma(\\pi) = (0,0)$, demonstrating that $\\gamma$ is not globally injective.\n\n4. An $n$-dimensional subset $X$ of a manifold $M$ is an embedded submanifold if for every point $p \\in X$, there exists a chart $(U, \\phi)$ on $M$ around $p$ such that $X \\cap U$ is mapped by $\\phi$ to the slice $\\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\{0\\}$ intersected with $\\phi(U)$. For a $1$-dimensional embedded submanifold in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, this means that near any point $p \\in X$, the set $X$ must look locally like a straight line (in some coordinate system). Topologically, this implies that for every $p \\in X$, there is a neighborhood of $p$ in $X$ (with the subspace topology) that is homeomorphic to an open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet's examine the point $p=(0,0) \\in X = \\gamma(\\mathbb{S}^1)$. As we found in part 3, this point is the image of two distinct points, $t=0$ and $t=\\pi$.\nNear $t=0$, $\\gamma(t) = (\\sin t, \\sin 2t) \\approx (t, 2t)$ for small $t$. The tangent vector is $\\gamma'(0) = (1, 2)$.\nNear $t=\\pi$, let $u=t-\\pi$. Then $t = \\pi+u$, and for small $u$, $\\gamma(\\pi+u) = (\\sin(\\pi+u), \\sin(2\\pi+2u)) = (-\\sin u, \\sin 2u) \\approx (-u, 2u)$. The tangent vector is $\\gamma'(\\pi)=(-1,2)$.\nSo, near the origin $(0,0)$, the image $X$ consists of two distinct curves crossing. Any open neighborhood of $(0,0)$ in $X$ (with the subspace topology inherited from $\\mathbb{R}^2$) resembles a cross shape 'X'.\n\nLet $N$ be such a neighborhood of $(0,0)$ in $X$. If we remove the point $(0,0)$ from $N$, the resulting set $N \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$ has four connected components. However, if we take any neighborhood in a $1$-dimensional manifold (which must be homeomorphic to an open interval $(a,b) \\subset \\mathbb{R}$) and remove a point, the resulting set has at most two connected components. Since the number of connected components is a topological invariant, no neighborhood of $(0,0)$ in $X$ can be homeomorphic to an open interval. Therefore, $X$ is not a topological manifold, and consequently it cannot be an embedded submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The slice chart condition fails at the self-intersection point $(0,0)$.\n\n5. The image $X = \\gamma(\\mathbb{S}^1)$ is a figure-eight curve. We model this as a $1$-dimensional finite cell complex (a graph).\nA cell complex decomposition is given by:\n- $0$-cells (vertices): There is one self-intersection point at $(0,0)$. This is the natural candidate for a vertex. Let $v_0$ be this vertex. The number of vertices is $V=1$.\n- $1$-cells (edges): The curve consists of two loops that start and end at the vertex $v_0$. One loop is the image $\\gamma((0,\\pi))$, and the other is the image $\\gamma((\\pi, 2\\pi))$. These correspond to two distinct edges, $e_1$ and $e_2$. The number of edges is $E=2$.\n\nThe Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$ for a cell complex is given by the alternating sum of the number of cells in each dimension:\n$$\n\\chi(X) = (\\text{number of 0-cells}) - (\\text{number of 1-cells})\n$$\nIn our model:\n$$\n\\chi(X) = V - E = 1 - 2 = -1\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the fact that the figure-eight curve $X$ is homotopy equivalent to the wedge sum of two circles, $\\mathbb{S}^1 \\vee \\mathbb{S}^1$. The Euler characteristic is a homotopy invariant, and $\\chi(\\mathbb{S}^1 \\vee \\mathbb{S}^1) = \\chi(\\mathbb{S}^1) + \\chi(\\mathbb{S}^1) - \\chi(\\{\\text{point}\\}) = 0 + 0 - 1 = -1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1}$$", "id": "3050742"}, {"introduction": "The gold standard for an embedding is one that preserves the geometry of the source manifold, known as an isometry.

These vectors are computed as the partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to the coordinates $u$ and $v$.\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivative vectors:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}\\left(\\frac{u}{2} \\cos v\\right),\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}\\left(\\frac{u}{2} \\sin v\\right),\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} u\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cos v,\\ \\frac{1}{2} \\sin v,\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial v} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}\\left(\\frac{u}{2} \\cos v\\right),\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}\\left(\\frac{u}{2} \\sin v\\right),\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} u\\right)\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{u}{2} \\sin v,\\ \\frac{u}{2} \\cos v,\\ 0\\right) $$\nTo check for linear independence in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, we compute their cross product:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} \\times \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial v} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}\\cos v & \\frac{1}{2}\\sin v & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\ -\\frac{u}{2}\\sin v & \\frac{u}{2}\\cos v & 0 \\end{vmatrix} $$\n$$ = \\mathbf{i}\\left(0 - \\frac{u\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\cos v\\right) - \\mathbf{j}\\left(0 - \\left(-\\frac{u\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\sin v\\right)\\right) + \\mathbf{k}\\left(\\frac{u}{4}\\cos^2 v - \\left(-\\frac{u}{4}\\sin^2 v\\right)\\right) $$\n$$ = \\left(-\\frac{u\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\cos v,\\ -\\frac{u\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\sin v,\\ \\frac{u}{4}(\\cos^2 v + \\sin^2 v)\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{u\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\cos v,\\ -\\frac{u\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\sin v,\\ \\frac{u}{4}\\right) $$\nThe vectors are linearly independent if and only if their cross product is non-zero. We compute the magnitude of the cross product:\n$$ \\left\\| \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} \\times \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial v} \\right\\| = \\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{u\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\cos v\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{u\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\sin v\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{u}{4}\\right)^2} $$\n$$ = \\sqrt{\\frac{3u^2}{16}\\cos^2 v + \\frac{3u^2}{16}\\sin^2 v + \\frac{u^2}{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3u^2}{16}(\\cos^2 v + \\sin^2 v) + \\frac{u^2}{16}} $$\n$$ = \\sqrt{\\frac{3u^2}{16} + \\frac{u^2}{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4u^2}{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{u^2}{4}} = \\frac{|u|}{2} $$\nThe domain for $u$ is the interval $[1,2]$, so $u \\ge 1$. Thus, the magnitude is $\\frac{u}{2} \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$, which is never zero. Since the cross product is never the zero vector on $M$, the vectors $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u}$ and $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial v}$ are linearly independent at every point of $M$. Therefore, $F$ is an immersion.\n\n**Part 2: Show that $F$ is an embedding.**\nAn embedding is an immersion that is also a homeomorphism onto its image. We have already shown $F$ is an immersion. A map is a homeomorphism onto its image if it is injective and the inverse map $F^{-1}: F(M) \\to M$ is continuous.\n\nFirst, we check injectivity. Suppose $F(u_1, v_1) = F(u_2, v_2)$ for $(u_1, v_1)$ and $(u_2, v_2)$ in $M$.\n$$ \\left(\\frac{u_1}{2} \\cos v_1,\\ \\frac{u_1}{2} \\sin v_1,\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} u_1\\right) = \\left(\\frac{u_2}{2} \\cos v_2,\\ \\frac{u_2}{2} \\sin v_2,\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} u_2\\right) $$\nEquating the third components gives $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} u_1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} u_2$, which implies $u_1 = u_2$.\nSince $u_1 = u_2$ and $u \\in [1,2]$ (so $u \\ne 0$), we can simplify the first two component equations:\n$$ \\frac{u_1}{2} \\cos v_1 = \\frac{u_1}{2} \\cos v_2 \\implies \\cos v_1 = \\cos v_2 $$\n$$ \\frac{u_1}{2} \\sin v_1 = \\frac{u_1}{2} \\sin v_2 \\implies \\sin v_1 = \\sin v_2 $$\nThese two equations imply that $v_1$ and $v_2$ represent the same point on the unit circle $S^{1}$. Thus, $(u_1, v_1) = (u_2, v_2)$ as points in $M = [1,2] \\times S^1$. The map $F$ is injective.\n\nNext, we must show that $F^{-1}: F(M) \\to M$ is continuous. A general theorem states that a continuous injection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism onto its image. The target space $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is a metric space, and thus is Hausdorff. The domain $M = [1,2] \\times S^{1}$ is the product of two compact spaces: The interval $[1,2]$ is closed and bounded in $\\mathbb{R}$, hence compact. The circle $S^{1}$ is also compact. The product of two compact spaces is compact, so $M$ is compact. The map $F$ is continuous because its component functions are compositions of polynomials and trigonometric functions, which are continuous.\nSince $F$ is a continuous injection from a compact space $M$ to a Hausdorff space $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, it is a homeomorphism onto its image $F(M)$.\nBecause $F$ is an immersion and a homeomorphism onto its image, it is an embedding. The image $F(M)$ is a smooth embedded submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\n\n**Part 3: Verify that $F$ is an isometry.**\nWe need to show that the pullback of the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ via $F$ is precisely the metric $g$ on $M$. That is, we must verify $F^{*}\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle = g$.\nThe pullback metric tensor components $(F^{*}\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle)_{ij}$ in the $(u,v)$ coordinates are given by $g_{ij} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x^i}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x^j} \\right\\rangle$, where $(x^1, x^2)=(u,v)$.\nWe compute the components $g_{uu}$, $g_{uv}$, and $g_{vv}$:\n$$ g_{uu} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cos v, \\frac{1}{2} \\sin v, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right), \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cos v, \\frac{1}{2} \\sin v, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\right\\rangle $$\n$$ = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\cos v\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sin v\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\cos^2 v + \\frac{1}{4}\\sin^2 v + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}(\\cos^2 v + \\sin^2 v) + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} = 1 $$\n$$ g_{vv} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial v}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial v} \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left(-\\frac{u}{2} \\sin v, \\frac{u}{2} \\cos v, 0\\right), \\left(-\\frac{u}{2} \\sin v, \\frac{u}{2} \\cos v, 0\\right) \\right\\rangle $$\n$$ = \\left(-\\frac{u}{2}\\sin v\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{u}{2}\\cos v\\right)^2 + 0^2 = \\frac{u^2}{4}\\sin^2 v + \\frac{u^2}{4}\\cos^2 v = \\frac{u^2}{4}(\\sin^2 v + \\cos^2 v) = \\frac{u^2}{4} = \\left(\\frac{u}{2}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ g_{uv} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial v} \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cos v, \\frac{1}{2} \\sin v, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right), \\left(-\\frac{u}{2} \\sin v, \\frac{u}{2} \\cos v, 0\\right) \\right\\rangle $$\n$$ = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\cos v\\right)\\left(-\\frac{u}{2}\\sin v\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sin v\\right)\\left(\\frac{u}{2}\\cos v\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)(0) = -\\frac{u}{4}\\cos v \\sin v + \\frac{u}{4}\\sin v \\cos v = 0 $$\nThe pullback metric is therefore $F^{*}\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle = g_{uu}\\,du^2 + 2 g_{uv}\\,du\\,dv + g_{vv}\\,dv^2 = (1)du^2 + 2(0)du\\,dv + \\left(\\frac{u}{2}\\right)^2 dv^2$.\nThis simplifies to $du^2 + \\left(\\frac{u}{2}\\right)^2 dv^2$, which is exactly the metric $g$ given for the manifold $M$.\nThus, $F^{*}\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle = g$, and $F$ is an isometry between $(M,g)$ and its image $F(M)$ with the induced metric.\n\n**Part 4: Compute the total area of the embedded surface $F(M)$.**\nThe area of the surface $F(M)$ is found by integrating the area element over the domain of parametrization. The area element $dA$ is derived from the metric tensor. For a metric represented by the matrix $G = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{uu} & g_{uv} \\\\ g_{vu} & g_{vv} \\end{pmatrix}$, the area element is $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(G)} \\,du\\,dv$.\nThe metric is the induced metric, which we've just shown has components $g_{uu}=1$, $g_{vv}=(u/2)^2$, and $g_{uv}=g_{vu}=0$. So, the matrix of the metric is:\n$$ G = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\left(\\frac{u}{2}\\right)^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant is $\\det(G) = (1)\\left(\\frac{u}{2}\\right)^2 - (0)(0) = \\frac{u^2}{4}$.\nThe area element is $dA = \\sqrt{\\frac{u^2}{4}} \\,du\\,dv = \\frac{|u|}{2}\\,du\\,dv$. Since $u \\in [1,2]$, $|u|=u$, and so $dA = \\frac{u}{2}\\,du\\,dv$.\nNote that this is consistent with the magnitude of the cross product calculated in Part 1, as expected: $dA = \\left\\| \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} \\times \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial v} \\right\\| \\,du\\,dv$.\nThe total area is the integral of this element over the domain $u \\in [1,2]$ and $v \\in [0, 2\\pi]$:\n$$ \\text{Area}(F(M)) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{1}^{2} \\frac{u}{2} \\,du\\,dv $$\nWe evaluate the inner integral with respect to $u$:\n$$ \\int_{1}^{2} \\frac{u}{2} \\,du = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{u^2}{2} \\right]_{1}^{2} = \\frac{1}{4} [u^2]_{1}^{2} = \\frac{1}{4}(2^2 - 1^2) = \\frac{1}{4}(4 - 1) = \\frac{3}{4} $$\nNow, we evaluate the outer integral with respect to $v$:\n$$ \\text{Area}(F(M)) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{3}{4} \\,dv = \\frac{3}{4} [v]_{0}^{2\\pi} = \\frac{3}{4}(2\\pi - 0) = \\frac{6\\pi}{4} = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} $$\nThe total area of the embedded surface $F(M)$ is $\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{3\\pi}{2}}\n$$", "id": "3050746"}]}
