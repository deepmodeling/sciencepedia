The associated Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ is characterized by the property that for any vector fields $X, Y$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the covariant derivative $\\nabla_X Y$ is just the directional derivative of the components of $Y$ in the direction of $X$. If we represent the vector fields in the standard basis, $\\nabla_X Y(p) = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{Y(p+hX(p)) - Y(p)}{h}$.

The velocity vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = v$, which is a constant vector.\n\nA Jacobi field $J(t)$ along a geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is a vector field that satisfies the Jacobi equation:\n$$ \\nabla_t^2 J(t) + R(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = 0 $$\nwhere $\\nabla_t$ denotes the covariant derivative along $\\gamma$, i.e., $\\nabla_t J(t) = \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}(t)} J(t)$.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of the Jacobi Equation in Euclidean Space**\n\nIn Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the covariant derivative $\\nabla_t$ of a vector field $J(t)$ along a curve $\\gamma(t)$ is simply the ordinary derivative of its components with respect to $t$. That is, if $J(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^n J_i(t) e_i$, where $\\{e_i\\}$ is the standard basis, then $\\nabla_t J(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{d J_i}{dt} e_i = \\frac{dJ}{dt}$.\nConsequently, the second covariant derivative is the second ordinary derivative:\n$$ \\nabla_t^2 J(t) = \\nabla_t (\\nabla_t J(t)) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{dJ}{dt}\\right) = \\frac{d^2J}{dt^2} $$\nAs stated in the problem's premises, the curvature tensor $R$ of Euclidean space is identically zero. Therefore, the curvature term in the Jacobi equation vanishes:\n$$ R(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = 0 $$\nSubstituting these results into the general Jacobi equation, we obtain the equation for a Jacobi field in $\\mathbb{R}^n$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2J}{dt^2} + 0 = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{d^2J}{dt^2} = 0 $$\n\n**Step 2: Explicit Solution of the Jacobi Equation**\n\nWe must solve the second-order ordinary differential equation $\\frac{d^2J}{dt^2} = 0$. Integrating once with respect to $t$ yields:\n$$ \\frac{dJ}{dt} = A $$\nwhere $A$ is a constant vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Integrating a second time yields:\n$$ J(t) = At + B $$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constant vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Thus, any Jacobi field along a geodesic in Euclidean space is a linear function of time.\n\n**Step 3: Characterization of Orthogonal Jacobi Fields**\n\nWe are asked to characterize the Jacobi fields $J(t)$ that are everywhere orthogonal to the velocity vector of the geodesic, $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. The velocity vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = v$. The orthogonality condition is $\\langle J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = 0$ for all $t \\in [0,L]$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $J(t)$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$:\n$$ \\langle At + B, v \\rangle = 0 $$\nUsing the linearity of the inner product:\n$$ t \\langle A, v \\rangle + \\langle B, v \\rangle = 0 $$\nThis equation is a polynomial in $t$ and must hold for all $t \\in [0,L]$. This is only possible if the coefficients of the powers of $t$ are all zero. Therefore, we must have:\n$$ \\langle A, v \\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\langle B, v \\rangle = 0 $$\nThis means that the constant vectors $A$ and $B$ must both be orthogonal to the direction vector $v$ of the geodesic. So, a Jacobi field $J(t)=At+B$ is orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}$ if and only if $A, B \\in (\\text{span}\\{v\\})^\\perp$.\n\n**Step 4: Existence of Conjugate Points**\n\nA point $\\gamma(t_0)$ for $t_0 > 0$ is conjugate to $\\gamma(0)$ along $\\gamma$ if there exists a non-trivial Jacobi field $J(t)$ (i.e., $J(t)$ is not identically zero) such that $J(0) = 0$ and $J(t_0) = 0$.\n\nThe problem asks to investigate this using the characterization of orthogonal fields, but we will first address the general case for completeness. Let $J(t) = At + B$ be any Jacobi field.\nThe condition $J(0) = 0$ implies:\n$$ A(0) + B = 0 \\implies B = 0 $$\nSo, the Jacobi field must be of the form $J(t) = At$. For the field to be non-trivial, we must have $A \\neq 0$.\nNow, we apply the second condition, $J(t_0) = 0$ for some $t_0 \\in (0,L]$:\n$$ A t_0 = 0 $$\nSince we are given $t_0 \\in (0,L]$, we know $t_0 > 0$. In a vector space, the product of a non-zero scalar ($t_0$) and a non-zero vector ($A$) cannot be the zero vector. Therefore, the equation $A t_0 = 0$ with $t_0 > 0$ implies that $A$ must be the zero vector, $A=0$.\nThis leads to $J(t) = 0t = 0$ for all $t$. This is the trivial Jacobi field.\nThus, there exists no non-trivial Jacobi field $J$ along $\\gamma$ such that $J(0)=0$ and $J(t_0)=0$ for any $t_0 > 0$.\n\nIf we restrict ourselves to the Jacobi fields orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}$ as prompted, the same conclusion holds. If $J(t)$ is an orthogonal Jacobi field with $J(0)=0$, then $B=0$ and $J(t)=At$ where $\\langle A, v \\rangle = 0$. For $J$ to be non-trivial, we need $A \\neq 0$. The condition $J(t_0)=0$ for $t_0 > 0$ again leads to $A t_0 = 0$, which implies $A=0$, a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, there are no conjugate points along any geodesic in Euclidean space.\n\n**Step 5: The Morse Index**\n\nThe Morse index theorem for geodesics states that the index of the energy functional at a geodesic $\\gamma: [0,L] \\to M$, for variations with fixed endpoints $\\gamma(0)$ and $\\gamma(L)$, is equal to the number of conjugate points to $\\gamma(0)$ along $\\gamma$ in the open interval $(0,L)$, where each conjugate point is counted with its multiplicity. The multiplicity of a conjugate point $\\gamma(t_c)$ is the dimension of the vector space of Jacobi fields $J$ that vanish at both $t=0$ and $t=t_c$.\n\nAs established in Step 4, for any geodesic in Euclidean space, there are no conjugate points. The dimension of the space of Jacobi fields vanishing at $t=0$ and $t=t_c$ for any $t_c \\in (0, L)$ is $0$.\nConsequently, the count of conjugate points in the interval $(0,L)$ is zero.\n\nAccording to the Morse index theorem, the Morse index of the energy functional at the geodesic $\\gamma$ is this count. Therefore, the Morse index is $0$. This aligns with the geometric intuition that a straight line segment in Euclidean space is a global minimum for the length (and energy) functional among all paths connecting its endpoints, implying the second variation is positive definite (for non-trivial variations) and the index is zero.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3074834"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the flat case, we now turn to the canonical example of a positively curved manifold, the unit sphere $S^n$.

The meridian $\\gamma(r) = (r, \\theta_0)$ is parameterized by arc-length, so its tangent vector is $\\gamma'(r) = \\partial_r$.

According to the problem, an orthogonal Jacobi field has the form $J(r) = y(r)E(r)$.\n\nTo find the Jacobi equation, we first determine if the frame vector $E(r)$ is parallel-transported. The only non-zero Christoffel symbol needed for this is $\\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta} = \\frac{f'(r)}{f(r)}$. We check the covariant derivative of $E(r)$ along $\\gamma$:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\gamma'}E = \\nabla_{\\partial_r}\\left(\\frac{1}{f(r)}\\partial_\\theta\\right) = \\left(\\partial_r \\frac{1}{f}\\right)\\partial_\\theta + \\frac{1}{f}\\nabla_{\\partial_r}\\partial_\\theta = -\\frac{f'}{f^2}\\partial_\\theta + \\frac{1}{f}\\left(\\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta}\\partial_\\theta\\right) = -\\frac{f'}{f^2}\\partial_\\theta + \\frac{1}{f}\\left(\\frac{f'}{f}\\partial_\\theta\\right) = 0 $$\nSince $E(r)$ is a parallel field along the geodesic, the covariant derivatives of $J(r)=y(r)E(r)$ are simple:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\gamma'}J = y'(r)E(r) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\nabla_{\\gamma'}^2 J = y''(r)E(r) $$\nThe general Jacobi equation is $\\nabla_{\\gamma'}^2 J + R(J,\\gamma')\\gamma' = 0$. Substituting our expressions gives:\n$$ y''(r)E(r) + R(y(r)E(r), \\gamma')\\gamma' = 0 \\implies y''(r)E(r) + y(r)R(E(r), \\gamma')\\gamma' = 0 $$\nThe curvature term $R(E, \\gamma')\\gamma'$ is related to the Gaussian curvature $K$ by the identity $R(E, \\gamma')\\gamma' = K(r)E(r)$. As we will show in part (b), $K(r) = -f''(r)/f(r)$. The Jacobi equation thus becomes:\n$$ y''(r)E(r) + y(r)K(r)E(r) = 0 $$\nThis yields the scalar Jacobi equation for the component function $y(r)$, expressed in terms of $f$:\n$$ y''(r) - \\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)}y(r) = 0 $$\nFor the metric to be smooth at the pole $r=0$, we require the profile function to satisfy $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=1$. A Jacobi field describing how geodesics emanate from the pole must vanish at $r=0$, and its initial derivative must be non-zero (representing the initial separation of geodesics). These conditions are captured by the standard initial values $y(0)=0$ and $y'(0)=1$. This choice uniquely determines the Jacobi field.\n\n(b) Gaussian curvature and rewriting the Jacobi equation.\n\nThe Gaussian curvature $K$ can be computed from the metric components. A standard formula for a metric of the form $dr^2+f(r)^2 d\\theta^2$ is $K = -f''(r)/f(r)$. To derive this, we can compute the Riemann tensor component $R^\\theta_{r\\theta r}$:\n$R^\\theta_{r\\theta r} = \\partial_r \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta r} - \\partial_\\theta \\Gamma^\\theta_{rr} + \\Gamma^\\alpha_{r \\beta}\\Gamma^\\theta_{\\alpha r} - \\Gamma^\\alpha_{\\theta \\beta}\\Gamma^\\theta_{\\alpha r}$.

This translates to finding a solution to $y''+Ky=0$ with $y(0)=0$ and $y(r_0)=0$ for some $r_0>0$. We analyze the solution with initial conditions $y(0)=0, y'(0)=1$.\n\nWe use the Sturm Comparison Theorem: Given two equations $u''+q_1(r)u=0$ and $v''+q_2(r)v=0$, if $q_1(r) \\ge q_2(r)$ on an interval, then between any two consecutive zeros of $v$, there is at least one zero of $u$ (unless $q_1=q_2$ and $u$ is a multiple of $v$).\n\nSufficient condition for existence of a conjugate point: We compare $y''+K(r)y=0$ with a reference equation $y_c''+k^2y_c=0$ where $k$ is a positive constant. The solution to the latter with $y_c(0)=0$ is $y_c(r)=A\\sin(kr)$, which has zeros at $r_n=n\\pi/k$. If there exists a constant $k^2>0$ such that $K(r) \\ge k^2$ for all $r \\in [0, L]$ for some $L > \\pi/k$, then by Sturm comparison, the solution $y(r)$ must have a zero in the interval $(0, \\pi/k]$. Therefore, a sufficient condition for the existence of a conjugate point is that the Gaussian curvature is bounded below by a positive constant, i.e., $K(r) \\ge k^2 > 0$. In terms of $f$, this condition is $-\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} \\ge k^2 > 0$, or $f''(r) + k^2 f(r) \\le 0$ (since $f>0$). Geometrically, positive curvature causes geodesics to converge, leading to conjugate points.\n\nSufficient condition for absence of conjugate points: We compare $y''+K(r)y=0$ with $y_c''=0$. The non-trivial solution with $y_c(0)=0$ is $y_c(r)=Ar$, which has no other zeros for $r>0$. If $K(r) \\le 0$ for all $r>0$, then by Sturm comparison, if $y(r)$ had a zero at $r_0>0$, then $y_c(r)$ must have a zero in $(0,r_0)$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $y(r)$ can have no zeros for $r>0$. A sufficient condition for the absence of conjugate points for all $r>0$ is $K(r) \\le 0$ for all $r>0$. In terms of $f$, this is $-\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)} \\le 0$, which is equivalent to $f''(r) \\ge 0$ (since $f>0$). Geometrically, non-positive curvature causes geodesics to diverge or remain parallel, preventing them from re-focusing.\n\n(d) Specialization to the unit sphere.\n\nFor the unit sphere $S^2$, the metric in geodesic polar coordinates is $ds^2 = dr^2 + (\\sin r)^2 d\\theta^2$, where $r$ is the geodesic distance from the pole.
