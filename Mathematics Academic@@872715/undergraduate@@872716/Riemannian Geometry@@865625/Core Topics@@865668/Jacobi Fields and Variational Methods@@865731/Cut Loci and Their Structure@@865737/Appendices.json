Recall the following fundamental definitions: the injectivity radius at a point $p \\in T^{n}$, denoted $\\operatorname{inj}_{p}(T^{n})$, is the supremum of radii $r > 0$ such that the Riemannian exponential map $\\exp_{p}$ restricts to a diffeomorphism from the open ball of radius $r$ in the tangent space $T_{p}T^{n}$ onto its image in $T^{n}$; the cut locus of $p$, denoted $C(p)$, is the closure of the set of points where minimizing geodesics starting from $p$ cease to be minimizing or cease to be unique.\n\nUsing only these foundational definitions, together with the facts that geodesics on $T^{n}$ are projections of straight lines in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and that the exponential map on a flat quotient descends from the identity map on the universal covering $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, derive an explicit expression for $\\operatorname{inj}_{p}(T^{n})$ in terms of the lattice $\\Lambda$, and explain how the cut locus $C(p)$ is determined by the structure of $\\Lambda$.

Express your final answer as an exact value (no rounding).", "solution": "The problem is to derive expressions for the injectivity radius and cut locus of a flat $n$-torus $T^n = \\mathbb{R}^n / \\Lambda$ and then to compute the injectivity radius for a specific $2$-torus.\n\nLet's begin by establishing the geometric framework. The flat $n$-torus $T^n$ is the quotient of the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ by a full-rank lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$. The Riemannian metric on $T^n$ is induced by the standard Euclidean inner product on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The projection map is $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to T^n$. This setup means $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the universal Riemannian cover of $T^n$.\n\nThe geodesics on $T^n$ are the projections of straight lines in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The exponential map at a point $p \\in T^n$, denoted $\\exp_p: T_pT^n \\to T^n$, is related to the exponential map on the covering space $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $\\tilde{p} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ be a lift of $p$, i.e., $\\pi(\\tilde{p}) = p$. The tangent space $T_pT^n$ can be canonically identified with $T_{\\tilde{p}}\\mathbb{R}^n$, which is itself identified with $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The exponential map on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is simply vector addition: $\\exp^{\\mathbb{R}^n}_{\\tilde{p}}(w) = \\tilde{p} + w$ for $w \\in T_{\\tilde{p}}\\mathbb{R}^n \\cong \\mathbb{R}^n$. As stated in the problem, the exponential map on the torus descends from this map. For a tangent vector $w \\in T_pT^n$, $\\exp_p(w)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\exp_p(w) = \\pi(\\exp^{\\mathbb{R}^n}_{\\tilde{p}}(w)) = \\pi(\\tilde{p} + w)\n$$\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the injectivity radius, $\\operatorname{inj}_p(T^n)$.\nBy definition, $\\operatorname{inj}_p(T^n)$ is the supremum of radii $r > 0$ such that $\\exp_p$ is a diffeomorphism from the open ball $B_r(0) \\subset T_pT^n$ to its image. The map $\\exp_p$ fails to be injective on $B_r(0)$ if there exist two distinct vectors $w_1, w_2 \\in B_r(0)$ such that $\\exp_p(w_1) = \\exp_p(w_2)$.\nUsing the formula for the exponential map:\n$$\n\\pi(\\tilde{p} + w_1) = \\pi(\\tilde{p} + w_2)\n$$\nTwo points in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ project to the same point in $T^n$ if and only if their difference is a non-zero lattice vector. Thus, the condition is:\n$$\n(\\tilde{p} + w_1) - (\\tilde{p} + w_2) = v \\quad \\text{for some } v \\in \\Lambda \\setminus \\{0\\}\n$$\nThis simplifies to $w_1 - w_2 = v$.\nFor $\\exp_p$ to be injective on $B_r(0)$, there must not be any pair of distinct vectors $w_1, w_2 \\in B_r(0)$ whose difference is a non-zero lattice vector. The set of all possible differences $w_1 - w_2$ for $w_1, w_2 \\in B_r(0)$ is the open ball $B_{2r}(0)$. Therefore, the condition for injectivity on $B_r(0)$ is that $B_{2r}(0)$ contains no non-zero lattice vectors:\n$$\nB_{2r}(0) \\cap (\\Lambda \\setminus \\{0\\}) = \\emptyset\n$$\nThis is equivalent to requiring that for every $v \\in \\Lambda \\setminus \\{0\\}$, its norm must be greater than or equal to the radius of this ball, i.e., $\\|v\\| \\ge 2r$. The supremum of $r$ values satisfying this condition is found by taking the equality for the shortest lattice vector:\n$$\n2r = \\min_{v \\in \\Lambda \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\|v\\|\n$$\nThus, the injectivity radius is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{inj}_p(T^n) = \\frac{1}{2} \\min_{v \\in \\Lambda \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\|v\\|\n$$\nThis expression depends only on the lattice $\\Lambda$ and is independent of the point $p$.\n\nNext, we explain how the cut locus $C(p)$ is determined. The cut locus of $p$ is the set of points $q$ for which there is no unique minimizing geodesic from $p$ to $q$.\nLet $q = \\exp_p(w)$ for some $w \\in T_pT^n$. The geodesic segment from $p$ to $q$ is $\\gamma(t) = \\exp_p(tw)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. Its length is $\\|w\\|$. This geodesic is minimizing if its length equals the Riemannian distance $d(p,q)$.\nThe distance $d(p,q)$ is the infimum of lengths of all paths from $p$ to $q$. Any such path lifts to a path in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ starting at $\\tilde{p}$ and ending at a lift of $q$. Let's set $\\tilde{q} = \\tilde{p}+w$. The set of all lifts of $q$ is $\\{\\tilde{q}+v \\mid v \\in \\Lambda\\}$. The distance is:\n$$\nd(p,q) = \\min_{v \\in \\Lambda} d_{\\mathbb{R}^n}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{q}+v) = \\min_{v \\in \\Lambda} \\|\\tilde{p} - (\\tilde{p}+w+v)\\| = \\min_{v \\in \\Lambda} \\|-w-v\\| = \\min_{v \\in \\Lambda} \\|w+v\\|\n$$\nSince $\\Lambda$ is a group, $\\{w+v \\mid v \\in \\Lambda\\}$ is the same set as $\\{w-v \\mid v \\in \\Lambda\\}$. So, $d(p,q) = \\min_{v \\in \\Lambda} \\|w-v\\|$.\nThe geodesic segment of length $\\|w\\|$ is minimizing if and only if $\\|w\\| = d(p,q)$, which means:\n$$\n\\|w\\| \\le \\|w-v\\| \\quad \\text{for all } v \\in \\Lambda\n$$\nThis inequality defines the Voronoi cell (or Dirichlet domain) of the origin in the lattice $\\Lambda$, let's call it $W_0$.\n$$\nW_0 = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid \\|x\\| \\le \\|x-v\\| \\text{ for all } v \\in \\Lambda\\}\n$$\nThe inequality $\\|x\\| \\le \\|x-v\\|$ is equivalent to $\\|x\\|^2 \\le \\|x-v\\|^2 = \\|x\\|^2 - 2\\langle x, v \\rangle + \\|v\\|^2$, which simplifies to $2\\langle x, v \\rangle \\le \\|v\\|^2$. This shows that $W_0$ is a convex polytope defined by the intersection of half-spaces.\n\nThe cut locus $C(p)$ is the closure of the set of points $q=\\exp_p(w)$ where this minimizing property fails for the first time, or where uniqueness fails. Uniqueness of the minimizing geodesic fails if there is some non-zero $v_0 \\in \\Lambda$ for which $\\|w\\| = \\|w-v_0\\|$. This corresponds to $w$ being on the boundary of the Voronoi cell, $\\partial W_0$. For such a $w$, there are at least two minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $q$: one lifted to the segment from $\\tilde{p}$ to $\\tilde{p}+w$, and another lifted to the segment from $\\tilde{p}+v_0$ to $\\tilde{p}+w$. Both paths in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ have the same length and project to minimizing geodesics in $T^n$.\nTherefore, the cut locus of $p$ is the image of the boundary of the Voronoi cell under the exponential map:\n$$\nC(p) = \\exp_p(\\partial W_0) = \\pi(\\tilde{p} + \\partial W_0)\n$$\nThe structure of the cut locus is thus the projection of the boundary of the Voronoi cell of the lattice, translated to be centered at a lift of $p$. The injectivity radius is the shortest distance from $p$ to its cut locus, which is $\\min_{w \\in \\partial W_0} \\|w\\| = \\frac{1}{2}\\min_{v \\in \\Lambda\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\|v\\|$, consistent with our earlier derivation.\n\nNow, we apply this to the specific case: $n=2$, with lattice $\\Lambda$ generated by $v_1 = (3,0)$ and $v_2 = (1,2)$.\nA general lattice vector is $v = m v_1 + k v_2$ for integers $m, k$.\n$$\nv = m(3,0) + k(1,2) = (3m+k, 2k)\n$$\nWe need to compute $\\operatorname{inj}_p(T^2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\min_{v \\in \\Lambda \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\|v\\|$. This is equivalent to finding the minimum of $\\|v\\|^2$ for $(m,k) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$.\nThe squared norm is:\n$$\n\\|v\\|^2 = \\|(3m+k, 2k)\\|^2 = (3m+k)^2 + (2k)^2 = 9m^2 + 6mk + k^2 + 4k^2 = 9m^2 + 6mk + 5k^2\n$$\nWe test small integer values for $m$ and $k$ to find the minimum of this quadratic form.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item If $(m,k) = (\\pm 1, 0)$, $\\|v\\|^2 = 9(\\pm 1)^2 = 9$.

We will proceed by analyzing the relationship between $RP^{n}$ and its universal Riemannian covering space, the unit sphere $S^{n}$.\n\nThe Real Projective Space $RP^{n}$ is defined as the quotient of the unit sphere $S^{n} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ by the antipodal map $A: x \\mapsto -x$. The projection map is $\\pi: S^{n} \\to RP^{n}$, where $\\pi(x) = [x] = \\{x, -x\\}$. The metric on $RP^{n}$ is the unique Riemannian metric that makes $\\pi$ a local isometry. This implies that $\\pi$ is a $2$-to-$1$ covering map.\n\nGeodesics in $RP^{n}$ are the projections of geodesics in $S^{n}$. Geodesics in the unit sphere $S^{n}$ are great circles.

Since paths in $RP^{n}$ can be lifted to paths in $S^{n}$ starting at either $p$ or $-p$ and ending at either $q$ or $-q$, the distance is given by:\n$$\nd_{RP^{n}}([p], [q]) = \\min \\{d_{S^{n}}(p, q), d_{S^{n}}(p, -q)\\}\n$$\nUsing the property that $d_{S^{n}}(p, -q) = \\pi - d_{S^{n}}(p, q)$, the distance formula becomes:\n$$\nd_{RP^{n}}([p], [q]) = \\min \\{d_{S^{n}}(p, q), \\pi - d_{S^{n}}(p, q)\\}\n$$\nThis shows that the maximum possible distance between any two points in $RP^{n}$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nNow, let's analyze a unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ in $RP^{n}$ starting at $[x] = \\pi(x)$. We can lift this geodesic to a unique unit-speed geodesic $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)$ in $S^{n}$ starting at $x$. Since $\\pi$ is a local isometry, the length of the geodesic segment $\\gamma|_{[0, L]}$ is equal to the length of its lift $\\tilde{\\gamma}|_{[0, L]}$, which is $L$. For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ is a minimizing geodesic in $S^{n}$, so $d_{S^{n}}(x, \\tilde{\\gamma}(t)) = t$.\n\nThe geodesic segment $\\gamma|_{[0, t]}$ is globally minimizing if its length, which is $t$, equals the distance between its endpoints, $d_{RP^{n}}([x], \\gamma(t))$. Let's compute this distance:\n$$\nd_{RP^{n}}([x], \\gamma(t)) = d_{RP^{n}}(\\pi(x), \\pi(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))) = \\min \\{d_{S^{n}}(x, \\tilde{\\gamma}(t)), d_{S^{n}}(x, -\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))\\}\n$$\nWe have $d_{S^{n}}(x, \\tilde{\\gamma}(t)) = t$. The distance to the antipode of the endpoint is $d_{S^{n}}(x, -\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)) = \\pi - d_{S^{n}}(x, \\tilde{\\gamma}(t)) = \\pi - t$.\nTherefore, the distance between the endpoints of $\\gamma$ is:\n$$\nd_{RP^{n}}([x], \\gamma(t)) = \\min\\{t, \\pi - t\\}\n$$\nThe geodesic segment $\\gamma|_{[0,t]}$ is minimizing if its length $t$ is equal to this distance. The equality $t = \\min\\{t, \\pi - t\\}$ holds if and only if $t \\le \\pi - t$, which simplifies to $2t \\le \\pi$, or $t \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nFor any $t > \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the length of the geodesic segment is $t$, but the distance between its endpoints is $\\pi - t  t$. Thus, for any time $t > \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is no longer a globally minimizing path. This justifies why a unit-speed geodesic ceases to be globally minimizing after time $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nThe injectivity radius $\\operatorname{inj}([x])$ is the supremum of radii $r>0$ for which all radial geodesics of length less than $r$ initiating from $[x]$ are globally minimizing. Based on our analysis, this value is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The injectivity radius can also be defined as the lesser of two values: the distance to the cut locus and half the length of the shortest non-trivial geodesic loop. The cut locus $\\operatorname{Cut}([x])$ is the set of points where geodesics from $[x]$ first lose their minimizing property. This occurs at a distance of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ for all geodesics. The shortest non-trivial geodesic loop at $[x]$ is the projection of the geodesic from $x$ to $-x$ in $S^{n}$, which has length $\\pi$. Half of this length is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Both definitions consistently yield $\\operatorname{inj}([x]) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nFinally, we justify why there are multiple minimizing geodesics to points on the cut locus. A point $[y]$ belongs to the cut locus $\\operatorname{Cut}([x])$ if $d_{RP^{n}}([x], [y]) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Let us choose a lift $x \\in S^{n}$ for $[x]$ and $y \\in S^{n}$ for $[y]$.\nThe condition $d_{RP^{n}}([x], [y]) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ implies $\\min\\{d_{S^{n}}(x, y), \\pi - d_{S^{n}}(x, y)\\} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. This equality is satisfied if and only if $d_{S^{n}}(x, y) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Geometrically, this means that the point $y$ lies on the \"equator\" of $S^{n}$ with respect to the \"pole\" $x$.\nFor such a pair of points, we also have $d_{S^{n}}(x, -y) = \\pi - d_{S^{n}}(x, y) = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nNow, consider two distinct geodesics in $S^{n}$ starting at $x$:\n1. $\\tilde{\\gamma}_1$: the unique minimizing geodesic from $x$ to $y$.

Its length is $d_{S^{n}}(x, -y) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nLet us project these geodesics to $RP^{n}$:\n1. $\\gamma_1(t) = \\pi(\\tilde{\\gamma}_1(t))$ is a geodesic in $RP^{n}$ connecting $[x]$ to $[y]$. Its length is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which is equal to $d_{RP^{n}}([x], [y])$. Thus, $\\gamma_1$ is a minimizing geodesic.\n2. $\\gamma_2(t) = \\pi(\\tilde{\\gamma}_2(t))$ is a geodesic in $RP^{n}$ connecting $[x]$ to $\\pi(-y) = [y]$. Its length is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which is also equal to $d_{RP^{n}}([x], [y])$. Thus, $\\gamma_2$ is also a minimizing geodesic.\n\nThe two geodesics $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ are distinct because their initial velocity vectors are different. Let $\\tilde{v}_1 = \\tilde{\\gamma}_1'(0)$ and $\\tilde{v}_2 = \\tilde{\\gamma}_2'(0)$ be the initial velocities in $T_xS^{n}$. Since their endpoints $y = \\exp_x(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\tilde{v}_1)$ and $-y = \\exp_x(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\tilde{v}_2)$ are distinct, and the exponential map on $S^{n}$ is injective on the open ball of radius $\\pi$, we must have $\\tilde{v}_1 \\neq \\tilde{v}_2$. The map $d\\pi_x: T_xS^{n} \\to T_{[x]}RP^{n}$ is an isomorphism. Therefore, the initial velocities of the projected geodesics, $v_1 = d\\pi_x(\\tilde{v}_1)$ and $v_2 = d\\pi_x(\\tilde{v}_2)$, are also distinct. This confirms that $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ are two distinct minimizing geodesics in $RP^{n}$ connecting $[x]$ to the point $[y]$ in its cut locus.\n\nThe injectivity radius is constant for all points $[x] \\in RP^{n}$ because $RP^{n}$ is a homogeneous space.

Which option is correct?\n\nA. For a generic point $p$ on a closed orientable surface of genus $g$, $C(p)$ is a connected finite embedded graph whose vertices have degrees $1$ or $3$, and if $n_1$ and $n_3$ denote the number of degree $1$ and degree $3$ vertices, then $n_1 - n_3 = 2 - 4g$.

Consequently, on $T^2$ the cut locus is necessarily a trivalent tree, and on higher genus surfaces it remains acyclic.", "solution": "The user has requested a rigorous validation of the problem statement, followed by a full derivation and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe problem provides the following definitions and facts:\n1.  $M$ is a closed, connected, orientable Riemannian surface.\n2.  $p \\in M$ is a generic point, implying a generic local structure for its cut locus $C(p)$.\n3.  The cut locus $C(p)$ of $p$ is the closure of the set of endpoints of minimizing geodesics starting at $p$, and is also the set where the squared distance function from $p$ is not smooth.\n4.  For a generic metric on a surface, $C(p)$ is a finite, connected, embedded graph.\n5.  The vertices of this graph $C(p)$ have degrees $1$ or $3$. There are no degree $2$ or degree $4$ vertices.\n6.  The Euler characteristic of a finite CW complex $X$ is $\\chi(X) = \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty (-1)^i b_i(X)$, where $b_i(X)$ are the Betti numbers.\n7.  For a connected finite graph $G$, $\\chi(G) = V - E = 1 - b_1(G)$, where $V$ is the number of vertices, $E$ is the number of edges, and $b_1(G)$ is the first Betti number.\n8.  The space $M \\setminus \\mathrm{int}(D)$, where $D$ is an open metric disk around $p$, deformation retracts onto the cut locus $C(p)$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is a well-posed exercise in Riemannian geometry.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** All the provided definitions and \"facts\" are standard results in the field. The structure of the cut locus for a generic metric on a surface (a graph with vertices of degree $1$ and $3$) is a known, albeit non-trivial, theorem. The relationship between the surface and its cut locus via deformation retraction is also a foundational result. The definition of the Euler characteristic and its properties are standard in algebraic topology.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem asks to derive a relationship between the topology of the surface $M$ and the combinatorial structure of the graph $C(p)$ using only the provided facts. This is a clear and deductive task with a unique answer.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and objective, typical of a mathematics problem.\n\nThe problem exhibits none of the invalidity flaws:\n1.  **Scientific or Factual Unsoundness:** The premises are factually sound within the context of Riemannian geometry.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant:** The problem is formal and directly relevant to the topic.\n3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** The provided facts are sufficient and consistent for deriving the solution.\n4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible:** The setup describes a standard theoretical construct.\n5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured:** The problem is clearly structured for a logical deduction.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological:** The problem requires the synthesis of several non-trivial concepts from geometry and topology.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability:** The claims are mathematically verifiable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Relationship\n\nThe solution is derived by connecting the topology of the surface $M$ to the combinatorial properties of the graph $C(p)$ using the provided facts.\n\n1.  **Relate Euler Characteristics:**\n    The problem states that $M \\setminus \\mathrm{int}(D)$ deformation retracts onto $C(p)$, where $D$ is an open disk around $p$. A deformation retraction implies a homotopy equivalence. Homotopy equivalent spaces have the same Euler characteristic.\n    $$ \\chi(C(p)) = \\chi(M \\setminus \\mathrm{int}(D)) $$\n    The space $M \\setminus \\mathrm{int}(D)$ is the surface $M$ with an open disk removed. The Euler characteristic of a space obtained by removing an open cell is related to the original space's Euler characteristic. Specifically, using the additivity property $\\chi(A \\cup B) = \\chi(A) + \\chi(B) - \\chi(A \\cap B)$: let $A = M \\setminus D$ and $B = \\overline{D}$. Then $A \\cup B = M$ and $A \\cap B = \\partial D \\cong S^1$.\n    $$ \\chi(M) = \\chi(M \\setminus D) + \\chi(\\overline{D}) - \\chi(\\partial D) $$\n    We know that a closed disk $\\overline{D}$ is contractible, so $\\chi(\\overline{D}) = 1$. The boundary circle $S^1$ has Euler characteristic $\\chi(S^1) = 0$.\n    $$ \\chi(M) = \\chi(M \\setminus D) + 1 - 0 $$\n    This yields the crucial relationship:\n    $$ \\chi(C(p)) = \\chi(M \\setminus D) = \\chi(M) - 1 $$\n\n2.  **Apply to the Graph Structure:**\n    For a closed, connected, orientable surface of genus $g$, the Euler characteristic is given by the formula $\\chi(M) = 2 - 2g$. Substituting this into our relation:\n    $$ \\chi(C(p)) = (2 - 2g) - 1 = 1 - 2g $$\n    The problem also states that for a connected graph $G$, $\\chi(G) = 1 - b_1(G)$, where $b_1(G)$ is the first Betti number (the number of independent cycles). Applying this to the cut locus graph $C(p)$:\n    $$ \\chi(C(p)) = 1 - b_1(C(p)) $$\n    Equating the two expressions for $\\chi(C(p))$:\n    $$ 1 - 2g = 1 - b_1(C(p)) $$\n    This immediately implies a fundamental topological constraint:\n    $$ b_1(C(p)) = 2g $$\n\n3.  **Relate to Vertex Degrees:**\n    Let $V$ be the number of vertices and $E$ be the number of edges of the graph $C(p)$. The problem states that all vertices have degree $1$ or $3$. Let $n_1$ be the number of degree-$1$ vertices and $n_3$ be the number of degree-$3$ vertices.\n    The total number of vertices is $V = n_1 + n_3$.\n    The sum of the degrees of all vertices is related to the number of edges by the handshaking lemma: $\\sum_{v \\in V} \\mathrm{deg}(v) = 2E$.\n    $$ 1 \\cdot n_1 + 3 \\cdot n_3 = 2E $$\n    The Euler characteristic of the graph is $\\chi(C(p)) = V - E$. Substituting the expressions for $V$ and $E$:\n    $$ \\chi(C(p)) = (n_1 + n_3) - \\frac{n_1 + 3n_3}{2} = \\frac{2(n_1 + n_3) - (n_1 + 3n_3)}{2} = \\frac{n_1 - n_3}{2} $$\n    We already found that $\\chi(C(p)) = 1 - 2g$. Therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{n_1 - n_3}{2} = 1 - 2g $$\n    This gives the second key relationship, concerning the number of vertices of each degree:\n    $$ n_1 - n_3 = 2(1 - 2g) = 2 - 4g $$\n    These two main results, $b_1(C(p)) = 2g$ and $n_1 - n_3 = 2 - 4g$, are equivalent ways of expressing the same topological constraint.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For a generic point $p$ on a closed orientable surface of genus $g$, $C(p)$ is a connected finite embedded graph whose vertices have degrees $1$ or $3$, and if $n_1$ and $n_3$ denote the number of degree $1$ and degree $3$ vertices, then $n_1 - n_3 = 2 - 4g$. Equivalently, $V - E = \\chi(M) - 1 = 1 - 2g$ and $b_1\\!\\left(C(p)\\right) = 2g$. Examples: on $S^2$ ($g = 0$), $C(p)$ is a tree, e.g., a $Y$-shaped tree with $n_1 = 3$, $n_3 = 1$; on $T^2$ ($g = 1$), $C(p)$ can be a $\\theta$-graph with two degree $3$ vertices ($n_1 = 0$, $n_3 = 2$), $E = 3$, $b_1 = 2$; for $g \\geq 2$, trivalent graphs realizing $b_1 = 2g$ exist, e.g., for $g = 2$, one can have $n_1 = 0$, $n_3 = 6$, $E = 9$, $b_1 = 4$.**\n\n- **Formulas:** The formulas $n_1 - n_3 = 2 - 4g$ and $b_1(C(p)) = 2g$ are precisely what was derived. The equivalence $V-E = \\chi(C(p)) = \\chi(M) - 1 = 1-2g$ is also correct.\n- **Example ($g=0$, $S^2$):** For $g=0$, we must have $b_1(C(p)) = 2(0) = 0$, which means $C(p)$ must be a tree. The vertex formula gives $n_1 - n_3 = 2 - 4(0) = 2$. The example of a Y-shaped tree has $n_1 = 3$ (the endpoints) and $n_3 = 1$ (the central junction). We check: $n_1 - n_3 = 3 - 1 = 2$. This is a consistent and correct example.\n- **Example ($g=1$, $T^2$):** For $g=1$, we must have $b_1(C(p)) = 2(1) = 2$. The vertex formula gives $n_1 - n_3 = 2 - 4(1) = -2$. The example of a $\\theta$-graph has two vertices of degree $3$ and no vertices of degree $1$. Thus $n_1=0$, $n_3=2$. We check: $n_1 - n_3 = 0 - 2 = -2$. A $\\theta$-graph has $V=2, E=3$, so $\\chi = V-E = -1$. Since $\\chi=1-b_1$, we have $b_1 = 1-\\chi = 1 - (-1) = 2$. This is a consistent and correct example.\n- **Example ($g=2$):** For $g=2$, we must have $b_1(C(p))=2(2)=4$. The vertex formula gives $n_1-n_3=2-4(2)=-6$. The example is a trivalent graph ($n_1=0$). The formula then requires $0 - n_3 = -6$, so $n_3 = 6$. The sum of degrees is $3n_3 = 18$, so $2E=18$ and $E=9$. Number of vertices is $V=n_3=6$. For this graph, $\\chi = V-E=6-9=-3$. Checking against the Betti number: $b_1 = 1 - \\chi = 1 - (-3) = 4$. This is a consistent and correct example.\n\nAll statements and examples in this option are correct according to the derivation from the problem's premises.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The Euler characteristic of the cut locus equals that of the surface, $\\chi\\!\\left(C(p)\\right) = \\chi(M)$, so $V - E = 2 - 2g$ and $b_1\\!\\left(C(p)\\right) = 0$ for all $g$. Hence on $S^2$, $C(p)$ must have $V - E = 2$, which is realized by a simple closed geodesic (a circle), while on $T^2$ it forces $C(p)$ to be a tree.**\n\n- The initial premise, $\\chi(C(p)) = \\chi(M)$, is incorrect. As derived, $\\chi(C(p)) = \\chi(M) - 1$.\n- The deduction $b_1(C(p)) = 0$ for all $g$ is incorrect. From $\\chi=1-b_1$ and the (wrong) premise $\\chi=2-2g$, one would get $1-b_1 = 2-2g \\Rightarrow b_1 = 2g-1$, which is not $0$ for $g1/2$.\n- The example for $S^2$ is flawed. A connected graph cannot have $\\chi=V-E=2$. The maximum possible Euler characteristic for a connected graph is $1$ (for a tree).\n- The example for $T^2$ is flawed. It claims $\\chi(C(p))=\\chi(T^2)=0$, which implies $1-b_1(C(p))=0 \\Rightarrow b_1(C(p))=1$. A tree has $b_1=0$. The claim that $C(p)$ must be a tree is a contradiction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. For generic $p$, degree $4$ vertices are typical in $C(p)$ on orientable surfaces; moreover, the Euler characteristic imposes $n_1 - n_3 = 2 - 2g$. In particular, on $T^2$ one must have $b_1\\!\\left(C(p)\\right) = 1$, realized by a single cycle attached to trees.**\n\n- The claim about degree $4$ vertices directly contradicts fact #5 provided in the problem statement.\n- The formula $n_1 - n_3 = 2 - 2g$ is incorrect. The correct formula is $n_1 - n_3 = 2 - 4g$.\n- The claim for $T^2$ ($g=1$) that $b_1(C(p)) = 1$ is incorrect. The correct value is $b_1(C(p)) = 2g = 2$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. On any closed orientable surface and generic $p$, $C(p)$ is always a tree, so $b_1\\!\\left(C(p)\\right) = 0$ and $V - E = 1$. Consequently, on $T^2$ the cut locus is necessarily a trivalent tree, and on higher genus surfaces it remains acyclic.**\n\n- The claim that $C(p)$ is always a tree means $b_1(C(p))=0$ for all surfaces. This is only true for the sphere ($g=0$), as our derivation shows $b_1(C(p)) = 2g$. For any surface with $g \\geq 1$, the cut locus must contain cycles.\n- The consequence for $T^2$ ($g=1$) is that $C(p)$ is a tree. This is false, as $b_1(C(p))=2$.\n- The claim that on higher genus surfaces it remains acyclic (i.e., a tree/forest) is false, as $b_1(C(p))=2g  0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3043472"}]}
