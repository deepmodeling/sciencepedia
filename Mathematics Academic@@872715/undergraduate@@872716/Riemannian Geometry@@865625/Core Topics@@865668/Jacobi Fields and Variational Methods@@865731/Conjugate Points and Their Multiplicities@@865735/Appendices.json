The multiplicity is the dimension of the vector space of all such Jacobi fields.\n\nA Jacobi field $J$ along a geodesic $\\gamma$ satisfies the Jacobi equation:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J + R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{\\gamma}$ is the velocity vector of the geodesic $\\gamma$, $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}$ is the covariant derivative along $\\gamma$, and $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor.\n\nFor a manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$, the Riemann curvature tensor is given by:\n$$\nR(X, Y)Z = K(\\langle Y, Z \\rangle X - \\langle X, Z \\rangle Y)\n$$\nfor any vector fields $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. Let's apply this to the Jacobi equation with $X=J$ and $Y=Z=\\dot{\\gamma}$:\n$$\nR(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = K(\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle J - \\langle J, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle \\dot{\\gamma})\n$$\nSince $\\gamma$ is a unit-speed geodesic, we have $\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = 1$ for all $t$. The expression for the curvature term simplifies to $K(J - \\langle J, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle \\dot{\\gamma})$.\nThe Jacobi equation becomes:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J + K(J - \\langle J, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle \\dot{\\gamma}) = 0\n$$\nTo solve this equation, we decompose the Jacobi field $J(t)$ into its component parallel to $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ and its component orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. Let $J(t) = J^{\\top}(t) + J^{\\perp}(t)$, where $J^{\\top}(t)$ is tangent to $\\gamma$ and $J^{\\perp}(t)$ is normal to $\\gamma$. We can write $J^{\\top}(t) = a(t)\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ for some scalar function $a(t)$, and $\\langle J^{\\perp}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = 0$.\n\nThe term $J - \\langle J, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle \\dot{\\gamma}$ simplifies to $J^{\\perp}(t)$, since $\\langle J, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle \\dot{\\gamma} = \\langle a(t)\\dot{\\gamma} + J^{\\perp}, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle \\dot{\\gamma} = a(t)\\dot{\\gamma} = J^{\\top}(t)$.\nThe Jacobi equation can be written as:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}(J^{\\top} + J^{\\perp}) + KJ^{\\perp} = 0\n$$\nSince $\\gamma$ is a geodesic, $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$. The second covariant derivative of the tangential component is:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J^{\\top} = \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}(a'(t)\\dot{\\gamma}(t)) = a''(t)\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\n$$\nThis vector is tangential to $\\gamma$. The vector field $J^{\\perp}$ and its covariant derivatives $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J^{\\perp}$ and $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J^{\\perp}$ are orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}$.

The condition $J^{\\top}(0)=0$ means $a(0)=0$, so $c_2 = 0$. Thus, $a(t) = c_1 t$.\nThe condition $J(t_c)=0$ implies $J^{\\top}(t_c)=0$, so $a(t_c) = c_1 t_c = 0$. Since we are interested in $t_c > 0$, this implies $c_1 = 0$.\nTherefore, any Jacobi field satisfying $J(0)=0$ and $J(t_c)=0$ for $t_c>0$ must have its tangential part $J^{\\top}(t)$ be identically zero. Such a Jacobi field is purely orthogonal: $J(t) = J^{\\perp}(t)$.\n\nNow we solve equation $(2)$ for $J^{\\perp}(t)$.

Since the frame is parallel, the second covariant derivative is simply:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J^{\\perp}(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} j_i''(t) E_i(t)\n$$\nSubstituting this into equation $(2)$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} j_i''(t) E_i(t) + K \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} j_i(t) E_i(t) = 0 \\implies \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (j_i''(t) + K j_i(t))E_i(t) = 0\n$$\nAs the frame vectors $\\{E_i(t)\\}$ are linearly independent, their coefficients must be zero. This gives $n-1$ independent differential equations:\n$$\nj_i''(t) + K j_i(t) = 0, \\quad i=1, \\dots, n-1\n$$\nSince $K>0$ is given, the general solution for each $j_i(t)$ is:\n$$\nj_i(t) = A_i \\cos(\\sqrt{K}t) + B_i \\sin(\\sqrt{K}t)\n$$\nThe boundary condition $J^{\\perp}(0)=0$ implies $j_i(0)=0$ for all $i$.\n$$\nj_i(0) = A_i \\cos(0) + B_i \\sin(0) = A_i = 0\n$$\nThus, the solutions must be of the form $j_i(t) = B_i \\sin(\\sqrt{K}t)$. The Jacobi field is $J(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} B_i \\sin(\\sqrt{K}t) E_i(t)$.\n\nFor a non-trivial Jacobi field, at least one coefficient $B_i$ must be non-zero. The second condition $J(t_c)=0$ for $t_c > 0$ requires:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} B_i \\sin(\\sqrt{K}t_c) E_i(t_c) = 0\n$$\nSince the vectors $E_i(t_c)$ are linearly independent and at least one $B_i$ is non-zero, we must have:\n$$\n\\sin(\\sqrt{K}t_c) = 0\n$$\nThe solutions for $t_c > 0$ are given by $\\sqrt{K}t_c = m\\pi$ for any positive integer $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\nThe conjugate points are located at $\\gamma(t_m)$ where $t_m = \\frac{m\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the *first* conjugate point, which corresponds to the smallest positive time $t_c$. This occurs for $m=1$, giving $t_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}}$.\n\nThe multiplicity of this first conjugate point is the dimension of the space of Jacobi fields $J(t)$ satisfying $J(0)=0$ and $J(t_1)=0$. We found these fields are of the form:\n$$\nJ(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} B_i \\sin(\\sqrt{K}t) E_i(t)\n$$\nThe condition $J(t_1) = J(\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}}) = 0$ is automatically satisfied because $\\sin(\\sqrt{K} \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}}) = \\sin(\\pi) = 0$, regardless of the choice of the constants $B_i$.\nThe space of these Jacobi fields is defined by the set of all possible choices for the coefficients $(B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_{n-1}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$.
