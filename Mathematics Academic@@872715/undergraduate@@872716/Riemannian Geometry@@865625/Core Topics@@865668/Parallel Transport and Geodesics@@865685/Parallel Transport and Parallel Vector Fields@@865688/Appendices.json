The use of spherical coordinates, including the singularity at the pole, is a typical feature of such problems and does not render the problem invalid, but rather requires careful handling. The identification of the tangent space at the north pole with the $xy$-plane is a common convention. The problem is scientifically grounded, objective, self-contained, and consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for the result of parallel transporting a vector along a curve on the unit sphere $S^2$. We will work with the embedding of $S^2$ in the ambient Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n1.  **Represent the curve and initial vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.**\n    The curve $\\gamma$ is the meridian defined by $\\lambda=0$ and $\\varphi$ decreasing from $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to $0$. We can parameterize this curve using a parameter $t \\in [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$ by setting $\\varphi(t) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - t$ and $\\lambda(t) = 0$. The position vector $R(t)$ for a point on the curve is given by the embedding:\n    $$R(t) = (\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-t)\\cos(0), \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-t)\\sin(0), \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-t)) = (\\cos t, 0, \\sin t)$$\n    At $t=0$, $R(0) = (1,0,0) = p$. At $t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $R(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = (0,0,1) = n$. This parameterization correctly describes the path from $p$ to $n$.\n\n    The initial vector $v_0$ is the unit tangent vector at $p$ in the direction of increasing longitude. This corresponds to the vector $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\lambda}$. We find its representation in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ by differentiating the position vector $R(\\varphi, \\lambda)$:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\lambda} = (-\\sin\\varphi\\sin\\lambda, \\sin\\varphi\\cos\\lambda, 0)$$\n    At point $p$, we have $(\\varphi, \\lambda) = (\\frac{\\pi}{2}, 0)$. Evaluating the vector at this point:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\lambda}\\bigg|_{p} = (-\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2})\\sin(0), \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2})\\cos(0), 0) = (0, 1, 0) $$\n    The norm of this vector is $\\sqrt{g_{\\lambda\\lambda}|_{p}} = \\sqrt{\\sin^2(\\frac{\\pi}{2})} = 1$. So, the initial vector is $v_0 = (0,1,0)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n2.  **Use the properties of parallel transport along a geodesic.**\n    A meridian on a sphere is a great circle, which is a geodesic. For a vector field $V(t)$ to be parallel-transported along a curve $\\gamma(t)$ on a surface embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, its covariant derivative along the curve must be zero: $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} V = 0$. This condition is equivalent to stating that the ambient derivative $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ is purely normal to the tangent space of the surface at each point, i.e., $ \\frac{dV}{dt} \\perp T_{\\gamma(t)}S^2 $.\n\n    Since our curve $\\gamma$ is a geodesic, there is a significant simplification. Let's consider a constant vector field $V(t) = v_c$ in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^3$. For this field, the ambient derivative is $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 0$. This trivially satisfies the condition $ \\frac{dV}{dt} \\perp T_{\\gamma(t)}S^2 $. Thus, a constant vector field in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is parallel-transported along any curve $\\gamma$ on the sphere, provided that it remains tangent to the sphere at every point along the curve.\n\n3.  **Verify the tangency condition.**\n    Let's test if the constant vector field $V(t) = v_0 = (0,1,0)$ is a valid tangent vector field along the curve $\\gamma(t)$. A vector is tangent to the sphere at a point if it is orthogonal to the position vector (the normal vector) at that point. We must check if $V(t) \\cdot R(t) = 0$ for all $t \\in [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$.\n    $$ V(t) \\cdot R(t) = (0,1,0) \\cdot (\\cos t, 0, \\sin t) = 0 \\cdot \\cos t + 1 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot \\sin t = 0 $$\n    The condition is satisfied for all $t$. The initial vector $v_0$ at $t=0$ is indeed $(0,1,0)$. Therefore, the parallel transport of $v_0$ along the geodesic $\\gamma$ is the constant vector field $V(t)=(0,1,0)$ in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n4.  **Determine the final vector and its angle.**\n    The parallel transport ends at the north pole $n$ at parameter value $t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The final transported vector, $v_f$, is:\n    $$ v_f = V(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = (0,1,0) $$\n    This vector is in the tangent space $T_nS^2$ because it is orthogonal to the position vector of the north pole, $n=(0,0,1)$: $v_f \\cdot n = (0,1,0)\\cdot(0,0,1) = 0$.\n\n    The problem asks for the angle $\\alpha$ of this final vector in the tangent plane $T_nS^2$, which is identified with the plane $\\{(x,y,0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\}$. Under this identification, the vector $v_f = (0,1,0)$ corresponds to the vector $(0,1)$ in the standard $xy$-plane. The \"positive $x$-axis\" in the problem corresponds to the vector $(1,0)$.\n\n    The angle $\\alpha$ is the standard counterclockwise angle from the positive $x$-axis (direction $(1,0)$) to the vector $(0,1)$. This vector lies on the positive $y$-axis. The angle is therefore $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$$", "id": "3061487"}, {"introduction": "So far, we have exclusively used the Levi-Civita connection, which is defined by its unique properties of being torsion-free and metric-compatible.

Metric Compatibility**\n\nA connection $\\nabla$ is metric-compatible with a metric $g$ if the covariant derivative of the metric tensor is zero, i.e., $\\nabla g = 0$. The components of the covariant derivative of $g$ in a coordinate basis are given by the formula:\n$$(\\nabla_k g)_{ij} \\equiv (\\nabla_{\\partial_k} g)_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^k} - \\Gamma^{l}_{ki}g_{lj} - \\Gamma^{l}_{kj}g_{il}$$\nIn our case, we are using Cartesian coordinates on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, for which the components of the Euclidean metric are constant: $g_{11}=1$, $g_{22}=1$, and $g_{12}=g_{21}=0$. Therefore, the partial derivative term is zero: $\\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^k} = 0$. The formula simplifies to:\n$$(\\nabla_k g)_{ij} = - \\Gamma^{l}_{ki}g_{lj} - \\Gamma^{l}_{kj}g_{il}$$\nSince $g_{ij}=\\delta_{ij}$, we have $g_{lj}=\\delta_{lj}$ and $g_{il}=\\delta_{il}$. The expression further simplifies to:\n$$(\\nabla_k g)_{ij} = - \\Gamma^{j}_{ki} - \\Gamma^{i}_{kj}$$\nTo check for metric compatibility, we only need to find one non-zero component of $(\\nabla g)_{ijk}$. Let's compute $(\\nabla_1 g)_{11}$:\n$$(\\nabla_1 g)_{11} = - \\Gamma^{1}_{11} - \\Gamma^{1}_{11} = -2\\Gamma^{1}_{11}$$\nUsing our previously computed value $\\Gamma^{1}_{11} = 2a_1$, we get:\n$$(\\nabla_1 g)_{11} = -2(2a_1) = -4a_1$$\nThe problem states that $a_1 \\neq 0$. Therefore, $(\\nabla_1 g)_{11} = -4a_1 \\neq 0$. This single non-zero component is sufficient to conclude that $\\nabla g \\neq 0$.\nThe connection $\\nabla$ is not metric-compatible. An important consequence of this is that the length of a vector is not, in general, preserved under parallel transport with respect to this connection.\n\n**2. Parallel Transport**\n\nWe are given a curve $\\gamma(t) = (t, 0)$ for $t \\in [0,L]$. In coordinates, this is $x^1(t) = t$ and $x^2(t) = 0$. The tangent vector to the curve is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = (1, 0)$, so its components are $\\dot{\\gamma}^1(t) = 1$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}^2(t) = 0$.\n\nA vector field $V(t)$ is parallel along $\\gamma(t)$ if its covariant derivative along the curve is zero: $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}(t)}V(t)=0$. In components $V(t) = (V^1(t), V^2(t))$, this equation is written as:\n$$\\frac{d V^k}{dt} + \\Gamma^k_{ij} V^i \\dot{\\gamma}^j = 0 \\quad \\text{for } k=1,2$$\nSince $\\dot{\\gamma}^1=1$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}^2=0$, the sum over $j$ only has a non-zero term for $j=1$. The equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{d V^k}{dt} + \\Gamma^k_{i1} V^i = 0$$\nThis is a system of two first-order linear ordinary differential equations. Let's write them explicitly for $k=1$ and $k=2$:\nFor $k=1$: $\\frac{d V^1}{dt} + \\Gamma^1_{11}V^1 + \\Gamma^1_{21}V^2 = 0$.\nFor $k=2$: $\\frac{d V^2}{dt} + \\Gamma^2_{11}V^1 + \\Gamma^2_{21}V^2 = 0$.\n\nSubstituting the values of the Christoffel symbols we found:\n$\\Gamma^1_{11} = 2a_1$, $\\Gamma^1_{21} = a_2$, $\\Gamma^2_{11} = 0$, $\\Gamma^2_{21} = a_1$.\nThe system becomes:\n1. $\\frac{d V^1}{dt} + 2a_1 V^1 + a_2 V^2 = 0$\n2. $\\frac{d V^2}{dt} + a_1 V^2 = 0$\n\nWe solve this system with the initial condition $V(0) = (0,1)$, which means $V^1(0)=0$ and $V^2(0)=1$.\n\nFrom the second equation, $\\frac{d V^2}{dt} = -a_1 V^2$. The solution is $V^2(t) = C_2 \\exp(-a_1 t)$. Using the initial condition $V^2(0)=1$, we find $1 = C_2 \\exp(0)$, so $C_2=1$. Thus:\n$$V^2(t) = \\exp(-a_1 t)$$\nNow substitute this into the first equation:\n$$\\frac{d V^1}{dt} + 2a_1 V^1 + a_2 \\exp(-a_1 t) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{d V^1}{dt} + 2a_1 V^1 = -a_2 \\exp(-a_1 t)$$\nThis is a first-order linear inhomogeneous differential equation. The integrating factor is $I(t) = \\exp(\\int 2a_1 dt) = \\exp(2a_1 t)$. Multiplying the equation by $I(t)$:\n$$\\exp(2a_1 t)\\frac{d V^1}{dt} + 2a_1 \\exp(2a_1 t) V^1 = -a_2 \\exp(-a_1 t)\\exp(2a_1 t)$$\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( V^1(t) \\exp(2a_1 t) \\right) = -a_2 \\exp(a_1 t)$$\nIntegrating with respect to $t$:\n$$V^1(t) \\exp(2a_1 t) = \\int -a_2 \\exp(a_1 t) dt = -\\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\exp(a_1 t) + C_1$$\nHere we have used the given condition $a_1 \\neq 0$. Now we solve for $V^1(t)$:\n$$V^1(t) = -\\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\exp(-a_1 t) + C_1 \\exp(-2a_1 t)$$\nUsing the initial condition $V^1(0)=0$:\n$$0 = -\\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\exp(0) + C_1 \\exp(0) \\implies 0 = -\\frac{a_2}{a_1} + C_1 \\implies C_1 = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$$\nSo, the solution for $V^1(t)$ is:\n$$V^1(t) = -\\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\exp(-a_1 t) + \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\exp(-2a_1 t) = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\left( \\exp(-2a_1 t) - \\exp(-a_1 t) \\right)$$\nThe parallel vector field is $V(t) = (V^1(t), V^2(t))$.\n\n**3. Computation of the Ratio**\n\nThe squared length of a vector $W=(W^1, W^2)$ is given by $|W|^2 = g_{ij}W^i W^j = (W^1)^2 + (W^2)^2$.\nFirst, we compute the squared length of the initial vector $V(0)=(0,1)$:\n$$|V(0)|^2 = 0^2 + 1^2 = 1$$\nNext, we evaluate the vector $V(t)$ at the endpoint $t=L$:\n$$V^1(L) = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\left( \\exp(-2a_1 L) - \\exp(-a_1 L) \\right)$$\n$$V^2(L) = \\exp(-a_1 L)$$\nThe squared length at $t=L$ is:\n$$|V(L)|^2 = (V^1(L))^2 + (V^2(L))^2$$\n$$|V(L)|^2 = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} (\\exp(-2a_1 L) - \\exp(-a_1 L)) \\right)^2 + (\\exp(-a_1 L))^2$$\nLet's simplify this expression:\n$$|V(L)|^2 = \\frac{a_2^2}{a_1^2} \\left( \\exp(-4a_1 L) - 2\\exp(-3a_1 L) + \\exp(-2a_1 L) \\right) + \\exp(-2a_1 L)$$\nFactor out $\\exp(-2a_1 L)$:\n$$|V(L)|^2 = \\exp(-2a_1 L) \\left[ \\frac{a_2^2}{a_1^2} (\\exp(-2a_1 L) - 2\\exp(-a_1 L) + 1) + 1 \\right]$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is a perfect square:\n$$|V(L)|^2 = \\exp(-2a_1 L) \\left[ 1 + \\frac{a_2^2}{a_1^2} (1 - \\exp(-a_1 L))^2 \\right]$$\nThe problem asks for the ratio $R(L,a_{1},a_{2}) = \\frac{|V(L)|^{2}}{|V(0)|^{2}}$. Since $|V(0)|^2=1$, the ratio is simply $|V(L)|^2$.\n$$R(L,a_{1},a_{2}) = \\exp(-2a_1 L) \\left( 1 + \\frac{a_2^2}{a_1^2} (1 - \\exp(-a_1 L))^2 \\right)$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\exp(-2a_1 L) \\left(1 + \\frac{a_2^2}{a_1^2} \\left(1 - \\exp(-a_1 L)\\right)^2\\right)}\n$$", "id": "3061529"}]}
