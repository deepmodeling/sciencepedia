Express your final answer as an exact expression; no rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires a derivation of the geodesic equation on the Riemannian manifold $(\\mathbb{R}^{3}, g)$, where $g$ is the standard Euclidean metric, followed by an analysis of the existence, uniqueness, and length-minimizing properties of these geodesics, and finally a calculation of the geodesic distance between two specified points.\n\nFirst, we establish the properties of the metric and the associated Levi-Civita connection in standard Cartesian coordinates $(x^1, x^2, x^3)$. The metric $g$ is induced by the standard dot product on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. The line element $ds^2$ is given by\n$$ds^2 = (dx^1)^2 + (dx^2)^2 + (dx^3)^2$$\nThe components of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ are the coefficients of this quadratic form. In a matrix representation, this is:\n$$g_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\delta_{ij}$$\nwhere $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. The inverse metric tensor $g^{ij}$ is numerically identical to $g_{ij}$. Since all metric components $g_{ij}$ are constant values, their partial derivatives with respect to any coordinate $x^k$ are zero:\n$$\\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^k} = 0 \\quad \\forall i,j,k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$$\nThe Levi-Civita connection is uniquely determined by the metric through the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$. The formula for these symbols is:\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} + \\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^j} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l} \\right)$$\nSubstituting the fact that all partial derivatives of the metric components are zero, we immediately find that all Christoffel symbols vanish:\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (0 + 0 - 0) = 0 \\quad \\forall i,j,k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$$\nA geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is a curve that parallel transports its own tangent vector. This condition is expressed by the geodesic equation, which states that the covariant derivative of the tangent vector field $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ along the curve is zero: $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$. In local coordinates $x^k(t)$, this equation is:\n$$\\frac{d^2 x^k}{dt^2} + \\sum_{i,j=1}^{3} \\Gamma^k_{ij} \\frac{dx^i}{dt} \\frac{dx^j}{dt} = 0$$\nfor each component $k=1, 2, 3$. Since we have established that $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$ for all $i,j,k$ in Euclidean space with standard coordinates, the geodesic equation simplifies dramatically to:\n$$\\frac{d^2 x^k}{dt^2} = 0 \\quad \\text{for } k=1, 2, 3$$\nThis is a system of three independent second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We can solve this system by integrating twice with respect to the parameter $t$. The first integration yields:\n$$\\frac{dx^k}{dt} = v^k$$\nwhere $v^k$ are constants of integration, representing the components of a constant velocity vector $v = (v^1, v^2, v^3)$. A second integration gives the general solution for the path:\n$$x^k(t) = v^k t + p^k$$\nwhere $p^k$ are another set of constants of integration, representing the components of an initial position vector $p = (p^1, p^2, p^3)$. The vector equation $\\gamma(t) = vt + p$ is the parametric equation of a straight line in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Therefore, the geodesics on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with the Euclidean metric are precisely the straight lines.\n\nNext, we address the existence and uniqueness of geodesics. The geodesic equation is a system of second-order ODEs of the form $\\ddot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{F}(t, \\mathbf{x}, \\dot{\\mathbf{x}})$, where in this case $\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{0}$. The fundamental existence and uniqueness theorem for ODEs (the Picard-Lindelöf theorem) states that for any initial conditions of position $\\mathbf{x}(t_0) = \\mathbf{x}_0$ and velocity $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t_0) = \\mathbf{v}_0$, there exists a unique solution in a neighborhood of $t_0$, provided that $\\mathbf{F}$ is Lipschitz continuous in $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}$. In our case, $\\mathbf{F}=\\mathbf{0}$, which is infinitely differentiable and thus globally Lipschitz. This guarantees the existence of a unique solution for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This means that for any point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ and any tangent vector $v \\in T_p\\mathbb{R}^3 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$, there exists a unique geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ such that $\\gamma(0) = p$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}(0) = v$. Our explicit solution $\\gamma(t) = vt + p$ confirms this.\n\nFurthermore, we must justify that these geodesics (straight lines) globally minimize the length functional. The length $L$ of a differentiable curve $\\gamma(t)$ from $t=a$ to $t=b$ is given by:\n$$L(\\gamma) = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{g(\\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))} \\, dt = \\int_a^b ||\\dot{\\gamma}(t)|| \\, dt$$\nLet $p = \\gamma(a)$ and $q = \\gamma(b)$ be two points in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The vector connecting them is $q-p$. We can write this vector as the integral of the curve's velocity vector:\n$$q - p = \\int_a^b \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\, dt$$\nTaking the norm of both sides and applying the triangle inequality for integrals (a consequence of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality), we get:\n$$||q - p|| = \\left\\| \\int_a^b \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\, dt \\right\\| \\leq \\int_a^b ||\\dot{\\gamma}(t)|| \\, dt = L(\\gamma)$$\nThe term on the left, $||q - p||$, is the standard Euclidean distance between $p$ and $q$, which is the length of the straight-line path between them. The inequality shows that the length of any curve $\\gamma$ connecting $p$ and $q$ is greater than or equal to the length of the straight-line path. Equality holds if and only if the vector $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ has a constant direction for all $t \\in [a,b]$, which is true only if $\\gamma$ is a straight line. Thus, the straight line is the unique shortest path between any two points in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, and therefore geodesics in Euclidean space are globally length-minimizing. The geodesic distance between two points is the standard Euclidean distance.\n\nFinally, we calculate the geodesic distance between the points $p=(1,-2,0)$ and $q=(3,1,4)$. Based on our conclusion, this is the Euclidean distance, which is the magnitude of the vector displacement $q-p$.\n$$q - p = (3 - 1, 1 - (-2), 4 - 0) = (2, 3, 4)$$\nThe geodesic distance $d(p,q)$ is the norm of this vector:\n$$d(p,q) = ||q-p|| = \\sqrt{2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 9 + 16} = \\sqrt{29}$$\nThe final answer is the exact value $\\sqrt{29}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{29}}$$", "id": "3047705"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how geodesics behave in standard Cartesian coordinates, we now investigate the crucial role that the choice of coordinates plays.

The geodesic equations form a system of second-order ODEs. To apply the standard existence and uniqueness theorem (Picard-Lindelöf), we convert it to a first-order system. Let $u_1 = r$, $u_2 = \\dot{r}$, $u_3 = \\theta$, $u_4 = \\dot{\\theta}$. The system is:\n$$\n\\frac{du_1}{ds} = u_2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{du_2}{ds} = u_1 u_4^2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{du_3}{ds} = u_4\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{du_4}{ds} = -\\frac{2}{u_1} u_2 u_4\n$$\nThis system is of the form $\\dot{\\mathbf{u}} = F(\\mathbf{u})$. The function $F$ is defined by the right-hand sides. For any initial data with $r(0) = r_0  0$, we consider an open neighborhood where $r = u_1$ is bounded away from $0$. In such a neighborhood, the components of $F$ are continuously differentiable functions of $(u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4)$. A continuously differentiable function is locally Lipschitz. Therefore, by the Picard-Lindelöf theorem, for any initial condition $(r(0), \\theta(0), \\dot{r}(0), \\dot{\\theta}(0))$ with $r(0)  0$, there exists a unique solution (a unique local geodesic) passing through that point with the given initial velocity.\n\nAt $r=0$, the situation is different. The polar coordinate chart is singular at the origin. This manifests in the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta} = \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta r} = \\frac{1}{r}$, which are undefined at $r=0$. Consequently, the system of geodesic ODEs is singular at $r=0$. The function $F$ in the first-order system is undefined when $u_1=r=0$, so the Picard-Lindelöf theorem cannot be applied directly in these coordinates. This is a coordinate singularity, not a singularity of the underlying manifold, which is the smooth Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. In Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$, the metric is $g=dx^2+dy^2$. All metric components are constant, so all Christoffel symbols are zero. The geodesic equations become $\\ddot{x}=0$ and $\\ddot{y}=0$. The solutions are $x(s) = as+b$ and $y(s) = cs+d$, which are straight lines. This system of ODEs is non-singular everywhere, and the existence and uniqueness of a geodesic through any point (including the origin) with any initial velocity are guaranteed. Thus, despite the coordinate singularity at $r=0$ in the polar representation, unique geodesics exist everywhere on the manifold.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -r  \\frac{1}{r}  \\frac{1}{r} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3071424"}, {"introduction": "Now that we have explored flat space from different perspectives, we advance to a genuinely curved manifold—a representation of the hyperbolic plane.

Differentiating it with respect to $s$ yields $2u'\\exp(2u)v' + \\exp(2u)v'' = 0$, which simplifies to $v''+2u'v'=0$.\n\n**2. Existence and Uniqueness**\nThe system of geodesic equations can be written as a first-order system of ODEs by defining state variables $p(s) = u'(s)$ and $q(s) = v'(s)$:\n$u' = p$\n$v' = q$\n$p' = \\exp(2u)q^2$\n$q' = -2pq$\nLet the state vector be $Y(s) = (u(s), v(s), p(s), q(s))^T$. The system is $Y' = F(Y)$, where $F(u,v,p,q) = (p, q, \\exp(2u)q^2, -2pq)$. The vector field $F: \\mathbb{R}^4 \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$ is a $C^\\infty$ function of its arguments. According to the Picard-Lindelöf theorem, for any given initial condition $Y(0) = (u(0), v(0), u'(0), v'(0))$, there exists a unique solution $Y(s)$ on some open interval containing $s=0$.\nFurthermore, the manifold $(\\mathbb{R}^2, ds^2)$ has constant Gaussian curvature $K=-1$, is simply connected, and therefore is a complete Riemannian manifold (isometric to the hyperbolic plane). By the Hopf-Rinow theorem, all geodesics can be extended to be defined for all $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Thus, a unique solution exists for all $s$ for any given initial data.\n\n**3. Qualitative Behavior and Conserved Quantities**\nThe metric components do not depend on the coordinate $v$. This implies that the vector field $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}$ is a Killing vector field. This gives rise to a conserved quantity along geodesics:\n$c = g(\\gamma', \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}) = g_{vv}v' = \\exp(2u)v'$.\nFor a unit-speed parametrization, we have another conserved quantity, the energy, which is fixed to $1$:\n$(u')^2 + \\exp(2u)(v')^2 = 1$.\nSubstituting $v' = c\\exp(-2u)$ into the unit-speed condition gives:\n$(u')^2 + \\exp(2u)(c\\exp(-2u))^2 = 1 \\implies (u')^2 + c^2\\exp(-2u) = 1$.\nThis leads to an equation for $u'$ dependent only on $u$:\n$u' = \\pm\\sqrt{1 - c^2\\exp(-2u)}$.\n\n- **Monotonicity and Turning Points**: For $u'$ to be real, we must have $1 - c^2\\exp(-2u) \\ge 0$, which implies $\\exp(2u) \\ge c^2$, or $u \\ge \\ln|c|$. This means geodesics are confined to the region $u \\ge \\ln|c|$. A turning point for $u(s)$ occurs when $u' = 0$, which happens at $u = \\ln|c|$. At this point, the second derivative is $u'' = \\exp(2u)(v')^2 = \\exp(2u)(c\\exp(-2u))^2 = c^2\\exp(-2u)$. At $u=\\ln|c|$, $u'' = c^2\\exp(-2\\ln|c|) = c^2/c^2 = 1  0$. Thus, $u(s)$ reaches a minimum value $u_{min} = \\ln|c|$ and then increases. Consequently, $u(s)$ is not, in general, monotonic. It is monotonic only if $c=0$, in which case $u'=\\pm 1$ and $v'=0$ (a vertical line geodesic). For $c \\neq 0$, $u(s)$ decreases to a minimum and then increases, or vice-versa, symmetrical about the turning point.\n\n- **Asymptotic Behavior**: For any geodesic with $c \\ne 0$, $u(s) \\to \\infty$ as $s \\to \\pm \\infty$. As $u \\to \\infty$, the term $c^2\\exp(-2u) \\to 0$, so $(u')^2 \\to 1$. This means $u' \\to \\pm 1$ and the geodesic becomes asymptotically \"vertical\" in the $u$ direction. For the $v$ coordinate, $v' = c\\exp(-2u) \\to 0$ as $u \\to \\infty$. The total change in $v$ for large $s$ becomes small, as the integral $\\int v' ds \\approx \\int c\\exp(\\mp 2s)ds$ converges. Thus, $v(s)$ approaches constant asymptotic values $v_{\\pm\\infty}$ as $s \\to \\pm\\infty$.\n\n**4. Closed-form Expression for $v(u)$**\nWe are given initial conditions $u(0)=u_0$, $v(0)=v_0$, $u'(0)0$, and $v'(0)=\\alpha$. The conserved quantity is $c = \\exp(2u(0))v'(0) = \\exp(2u_0)\\alpha$.\nTo find $v$ as a function of $u$, we use the chain rule: $\\frac{dv}{du} = \\frac{dv/ds}{du/ds} = \\frac{v'}{u'}$.\nFrom the conserved quantities, and using $u'(0)0$ to resolve the sign ambiguity for the square root:\n$v' = c\\exp(-2u)$\n$u' = \\sqrt{1 - c^2\\exp(-2u)}$\nSo, the differential equation for the path in the $(u,v)$-plane is:\n$$ \\frac{dv}{du} = \\frac{c\\exp(-2u)}{\\sqrt{1 - c^2\\exp(-2u)}} $$\nWe integrate this expression with respect to $u$ from the initial point $(u_0, v_0)$ to a general point $(u, v(u))$:\n$$ v(u) - v_0 = \\int_{u_0}^{u} \\frac{c\\exp(-2\\tilde{u})}{\\sqrt{1 - c^2\\exp(-2\\tilde{u})}} d\\tilde{u} $$\nTo evaluate the integral, we can find the antiderivative of the integrand. Let $F(u) = \\frac{1}{c}\\sqrt{1 - c^2\\exp(-2u)}$. Its derivative with respect to $u$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dF}{du} = \\frac{1}{c} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{1 - c^2\\exp(-2u)}} \\cdot (-c^2)(-2\\exp(-2u)) = \\frac{c\\exp(-2u)}{\\sqrt{1 - c^2\\exp(-2u)}} $$\nThis matches our integrand. Thus, by the fundamental theorem of calculus:\n$$ v(u) - v_0 = \\left[ F(\\tilde{u}) \\right]_{u_0}^{u} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{c}\\sqrt{1 - c^2\\exp(-2\\tilde{u})} \\right]_{u_0}^{u} $$\n$$ v(u) - v_0 = \\frac{1}{c}\\sqrt{1 - c^2\\exp(-2u)} - \\frac{1}{c}\\sqrt{1 - c^2\\exp(-2u_0)} $$\nTherefore, the closed-form expression for $v(u)$ is:\n$$ v(u) = v_0 + \\frac{1}{c} \\left( \\sqrt{1 - c^2\\exp(-2u)} - \\sqrt{1 - c^2\\exp(-2u_0)} \\right) $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{v_0 + \\frac{1}{c} \\left( \\sqrt{1 - c^{2}\\exp(-2u)} - \\sqrt{1 - c^{2}\\exp(-2u_0)} \\right)}\n$$", "id": "3071417"}]}
