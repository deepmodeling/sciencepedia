Let the arc length at the start be $s_0=s(0)$ and at the end be $s_f=s(2\\pi)$.\n\nBy the fundamental theorem of calculus, the total curvature is the total change in the angle $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\text{Total Curvature} = \\int_{s_0}^{s_f} \\frac{d\\theta}{ds} \\, ds = \\theta(s_f) - \\theta(s_0)\n$$\nThis is equivalent to finding the difference between the final tangent angle, $\\theta(t=2\\pi)$, and the initial tangent angle, $\\theta(t=0)$.\n\nTo determine the tangent angle, we first find the unit tangent vector. The velocity vector of the curve is given in complex form as:\n$$\nz'(t) = \\rho(t) \\exp(i k t)\n$$\nHere, $\\rho(t)$ is a smooth function with $\\rho(t) \\in (0, \\infty)$ for all $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$, and $k$ is a fixed integer. The speed of the curve is the magnitude of the velocity vector:\n$$\n|z'(t)| = |\\rho(t) \\exp(i k t)| = |\\rho(t)| |\\exp(i k t)|\n$$\nSince $\\rho(t)$ is strictly positive, $|\\rho(t)| = \\rho(t)$. The magnitude of the complex exponential is always $1$, i.e., $|\\exp(i k t)| = \\sqrt{\\cos^2(kt) + \\sin^2(kt)} = 1$.\nTherefore, the speed is $|z'(t)| = \\rho(t)$.

An immersion requires the tangent vector $\\gamma'(t)$ to be non-zero for all $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.

We have $\\cos(2t) = \\cos(3\\pi) = -1 \\neq 0$.\n\nSince the two components of $\\gamma'(t)$ are never simultaneously zero, $\\gamma'(t) \\neq (0, 0)$ for all $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. Therefore, the curve $\\gamma$ is an immersion.\nThis completes the verification that $\\gamma$ is a closed immersed curve.\n\n**Task 2: Compute the total change $\\Delta\\theta = \\theta(2\\pi) - \\theta(0)$**\n\nThe total change in the tangent angle can be found by tracking the path of the velocity vector $v(t) = (2\\cos(2t), \\cos(t))$ in the plane. Let's analyze its path over $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$:\n-   At $t=0$, $v(0) = (2,1)$.

The path for $t \\in [\\pi, 2\\pi]$ starts at $(2,-1)$ and exactly retraces the first part of the path in reverse, passing through $(-2,0)$ and ending back at $(2,1)$.\n\nSince the path of the velocity vector from $t=\\pi$ to $t=2\\pi$ is the exact reverse of the path from $t=0$ to $t=\\pi$, any angular change accumulated in the first half is precisely canceled out in the second half. Therefore, the net change in angle over the full interval $[0, 2\\pi]$ is zero.\n$$ \\Delta\\theta = \\theta(2\\pi) - \\theta(0) = 0 $$\nFormally, one can show this by computing the integral for the total angle change, $\\Delta\\theta = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} dt$. The integrand $f(t) = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$ can be shown to satisfy the symmetry property $f(t+\\pi) = -f(t)$. This implies:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta = \\int_0^{2\\pi} f(t) dt = \\int_0^\\pi f(t) dt + \\int_\\pi^{2\\pi} f(t) dt $$\nUsing a substitution $u = t - \\pi$ in the second integral gives $\\int_0^\\pi f(u+\\pi) du = \\int_0^\\pi -f(u) du = -\\int_0^\\pi f(t) dt$. Thus:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta = \\int_0^\\pi f(t) dt - \\int_0^\\pi f(t) dt = 0 $$\n\n**Task 3: Deduce the rotation index $r(\\gamma)$ and describe the winding of $v(t)$**\n\nThe rotation index $r(\\gamma)$ is defined as the total angle change divided by $2\\pi$. Using our result from Task 2:\n$$ r(\\gamma) = \\frac{\\Delta\\theta}{2\\pi} = \\frac{0}{2\\pi} = 0 $$\nThe rotation index of the curve $\\gamma$ is $0$.\n\nThe qualitative description of the winding of the tangent vector $v(t)$ is as follows: The path of $v(t)$ in the velocity plane starts at $(2,1)$ for $t=0$. As $t$ goes from $0$ to $\\pi$, the vector $v(t)$ sweeps out an arc in a counter-clockwise direction, ending at $(2,-1)$. As $t$ continues from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, the vector $v(t)$ sweeps back along the same arc in a clockwise direction, returning to $(2,1)$. The winding that occurs in the first half of the traversal is perfectly unwound in the second half, leading to a zero net rotation. This corresponds to the geometry of the curve $\\gamma(t)$, which is a figure-eight.

The turning number, a result of Hopf's Umlaufsatz, is an integer that quantifies the total number of rotations made by the unit tangent vector as one traverses the curve completely.\n\nThe core principle is to integrate the rate of change of the tangent vector's angle over the parameter interval. The turning number $r(\\gamma)$ for a curve parameterized on $[0, 2\\pi]$ is given by\n$$\nr(\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} dt = \\frac{\\theta(2\\pi) - \\theta(0)}{2\\pi}\n$$\nwhere $\\theta(t)$ is the angle of the unit tangent vector $T(t) = \\frac{z'(t)}{|z'(t)|}$. Since the angle of a complex number $w$ is given by $\\arg(w)$, we have $\\theta(t) = \\arg(T(t)) = \\arg(z'(t))$. The magnitude $|z'(t)|$ does not affect the angle. Therefore, we can work directly with the argument of the derivative, $z'(t)$.\n\nThe numerical implementation approximates this integral using a discrete sum. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Discretization**: The interval $[0, 2\\pi]$ is partitioned into $N$ equally spaced points, $t_j = j \\frac{2\\pi}{N-1}$ for $j=0, 1, \\dots, N-1$. A sufficiently large value for $N$ is chosen to ensure that the change in angle between consecutive points is less than $\\pi$, preventing aliasing issues.\n\n2.  **Angle Calculation**: For each test curve, defined by its derivative $z'(t)$, we evaluate this complex function at each sample point $t_j$ to get a sequence of complex numbers $\\{z'(t_j)\\}$. We then compute the principal argument of each complex number, $\\phi_j = \\arg(z'(t_j))$. Standard library functions typically return this angle in the interval $(-\\pi, \\pi]$.\n\n3.  **Angle Unwrapping**: The sequence of principal angles $\\{\\phi_j\\}$ will exhibit jumps of $\\pm 2\\pi$ whenever the continuously-varying angle $\\theta(t)$ crosses the $(-\\pi, \\pi]$ boundary. To obtain a discrete representation of the continuous angle function $\\theta(t)$, we must \"unwrap\" the sequence $\\{\\phi_j\\}$. This process involves adding or subtracting multiples of $2\\pi$ to subsequent angle values to ensure the difference between any two consecutive values is minimized. Specifically, if $\\phi_{j+1} - \\phi_j > \\pi$, it indicates a jump from near $\\pi$ to near $-\\pi$, so we adjust the subsequent part of the unwrapped sequence by subtracting $2\\pi$. Conversely, if $\\phi_{j+1} - \\phi_j < -\\pi$, we add $2\\pi$. The `numpy.unwrap` function automates this procedure. Let the resulting unwrapped angle sequence be $\\{\\theta_j\\}$.\n\n4.  **Turning Number Computation**: The total change in the continuous angle is approximated by the difference between the last and first elements of the unwrapped sequence, $\\Delta\\theta \\approx \\theta_{N-1} - \\theta_0$. The turning number is then calculated as\n    $$\n    r(\\gamma) \\approx \\frac{\\theta_{N-1} - \\theta_0}{2\\pi}\n    $$\n    Since Hopf's Umlaufsatz guarantees that $r(\\gamma)$ is an integer for any regular closed curve, we round the numerical result to the nearest integer to correct for any floating-point approximation errors.\n\nThis procedure is applied to each of the eight test cases provided.
