Let $\\xi$ be a unit normal vector spanning $\\mathcal{H}_p$. The claim is $T_U U = \\kappa(U)\\,\\xi$ for a unit $U \\in \\mathcal{V}_p$, with $\\kappa(U) = \\langle S_\\xi U, U \\rangle$.\nIn this case, any vector in $\\mathcal{H}_p$, such as $T_U U$, must be a scalar multiple of $\\xi$. So, we can write $T_U U = c\\,\\xi$ for some scalar $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nTo find $c$, we take the inner product with $\\xi$:\n$$\\langle T_U U, \\xi \\rangle = \\langle c\\,\\xi, \\xi \\rangle = c \\langle \\xi, \\xi \\rangle = c \\|\\xi\\|^2 = c$$\nBy the definition of the shape operator $S_\\xi$, we have $\\langle T_U U, \\xi \\rangle = \\langle S_\\xi U, U \\rangle$.\nThus, $c = \\langle S_\\xi U, U \\rangle$.\nThe problem correctly identifies $\\kappa(U) = \\langle S_\\xi U, U \\rangle$ as the normal curvature.\nSubstituting $c = \\kappa(U)$, we get $T_U U = \\kappa(U)\\,\\xi$. The statement is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option D Evaluation:**\nThe statement is $\\|T_U V\\|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\Big( \\langle S_{\\xi_i} U, U \\rangle^2 + \\langle S_{\\xi_i} V, V \\rangle^2 \\Big)$ for orthonormal $U, V$.\nLet's find the correct expression for $\\|T_U V\\|^2$. Using an orthonormal basis $\\{\\xi_i\\}$ for $\\mathcal{H}_p$:\n$$\\|T_U V\\|^2 = \\langle T_U V, T_U V \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\langle T_U V, \\xi_i \\rangle^2$$\nUsing the definition of the shape operator, $\\langle T_U V, \\xi_i \\rangle = \\langle S_{\\xi_i} U, V \\rangle$. So,\n$$\\|T_U V\\|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\langle S_{\\xi_i} U, V \\rangle^2$$\nThe statement claims this equals $\\sum_{i=1}^k \\Big( \\langle S_{\\xi_i} U, U \\rangle^2 + \\langle S_{\\xi_i} V, V \\rangle^2 \\Big)$. There is no general equality between $\\langle S_{\\xi_i} U, V \\rangle^2$ and $\\langle S_{\\xi_i} U, U \\rangle^2 + \\langle S_{\\xi_i} V, V \\rangle^2$. In general, these expressions are different.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option E Evaluation:**\nThe statement is for the hypersurface case ($\\dim \\mathcal{H}_p = 1$). It claims that if $U,V \\in \\mathcal{V}_p$ are distinct principal directions with respect to the unit normal $\\xi$ and are orthonormal, then $T_U V = 0$.\nLet $\\xi$ be the unit normal vector. Since $U$ and $V$ are principal directions, they are eigenvectors of the shape operator $S_\\xi$. Let $S_\\xi U = \\lambda_U U$ and $S_\\xi V = \\lambda_V V$, where $\\lambda_U, \\lambda_V$ are the corresponding principal curvatures.\nThe O'Neill tensor $T_U V$ is a vector in $\\mathcal{H}_p$, so it must be of the form $T_U V = c\\,\\xi$. The coefficient $c$ is given by $c = \\langle T_U V, \\xi \\rangle$.\nUsing the definition of the shape operator:\n$$c = \\langle T_U V, \\xi \\rangle = \\langle S_\\xi U, V \\rangle$$\nSubstituting $S_\\xi U = \\lambda_U U$:\n$$c = \\langle \\lambda_U U, V \\rangle = \\lambda_U \\langle U, V \\rangle$$\nThe problem specifies that $U,V$ are orthonormal vectors. This implies they are orthogonal, so $\\langle U, V \\rangle = 0$.\nTherefore, $c = \\lambda_U \\cdot 0 = 0$.\nThis gives $T_U V = 0 \\cdot \\xi = 0$. Consequently, $\\|T_U V\\|^2 = 0$.\nThe condition that $U,V$ are \"distinct principal directions\" reinforces their orthogonality if their principal curvatures $\\lambda_U, \\lambda_V$ are different, because eigenvectors of a self-adjoint operator (like $S_\\xi$) corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. However, the crucial piece of information is $\\langle U,V \\rangle = 0$, which is already guaranteed by the orthonormality of $U,V$. The conclusion holds.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCE}$$", "id": "3060984"}]}
