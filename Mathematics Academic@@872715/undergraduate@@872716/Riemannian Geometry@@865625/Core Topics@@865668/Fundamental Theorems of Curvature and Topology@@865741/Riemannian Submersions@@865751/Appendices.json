We will address the three tasks in sequence.\n\nLet $(B,h)$ and $(F,k)$ be connected Riemannian manifolds. Let $M = B \\times F$ be the product manifold with the product metric $g = h \\oplus k$, defined at a point $p=(b,f) \\in M$ for vectors $E_1 = (X_1, U_1)$ and $E_2=(X_2, U_2)$ in $T_p M \\cong T_b B \\times T_f F$ as $g_p(E_1, E_2) = h_b(X_1, X_2) + k_f(U_1, U_2)$. The map is the projection $\\pi: M \\to B$, $\\pi(b,f) = b$.\n\n**Task 1: Prove that $\\pi$ is a Riemannian submersion.**\n\nTo prove that $\\pi$ is a Riemannian submersion, we must show two conditions are met:\n1. The differential $d\\pi_p : T_p M \\to T_{\\pi(p)} B$ is surjective for all $p \\in M$.\n2. The restriction of $d\\pi_p$ to the horizontal subspace $\\mathcal{H}_p = (\\ker d\\pi_p)^\\perp$ is an isometry.\n\nLet $p=(b,f) \\in M$. A tangent vector at $p$ can be written as $E = (X,U)$ where $X \\in T_b B$ and $U \\in T_f F$. The differential $d\\pi_p$ maps a tangent vector at $p$ to a tangent vector at $\\pi(p)=b$. Let $\\gamma(t) = (b(t), f(t))$ be a curve in $M$ with $\\gamma(0)=p$ and $\\gamma'(0)=E=(X,U)$. Then $\\pi(\\gamma(t)) = b(t)$. The differential is given by:\n$$d\\pi_p(E) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\Big|_{t=0} \\pi(\\gamma(t)) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\Big|_{t=0} b(t) = X$$\nSo, $d\\pi_p((X,U)) = X$.\n\nFirst, we check for surjectivity. For any $X \\in T_b B$, we can choose the vector $E = (X,0) \\in T_p M$. Then $d\\pi_p(E) = X$, so $d\\pi_p$ is surjective.\n\nNext, we identify the vertical and horizontal subspaces. The vertical subspace $\\mathcal{V}_p$ is the kernel of $d\\pi_p$:\n$$\\mathcal{V}_p = \\ker d\\pi_p = \\{ (X,U) \\in T_p M \\mid d\\pi_p((X,U)) = 0 \\}$$\nSince $d\\pi_p((X,U))=X$, this condition becomes $X=0$. Thus, the vertical subspace is:\n$$\\mathcal{V}_p = \\{ (0,U) \\mid U \\in T_f F \\} \\cong T_f F$$\nThe horizontal subspace $\\mathcal{H}_p$ is the orthogonal complement of $\\mathcal{V}_p$ with respect to the metric $g_p$. A vector $E'=(X',U') \\in T_p M$ is in $\\mathcal{H}_p$ if $g_p(E', E_v) = 0$ for all $E_v \\in \\mathcal{V}_p$. Let $E_v = (0,U)$ for an arbitrary $U \\in T_f F$.\n$$g_p((X',U'), (0,U)) = h_b(X', 0) + k_f(U', U) = k_f(U', U)$$\nFor this to be zero for all $U \\in T_f F$, we must have $U'=0$ because $k_f$ is a non-degenerate metric. Therefore, the horizontal subspace is:\n$$\\mathcal{H}_p = \\{ (X,0) \\mid X \\in T_b B \\} \\cong T_b B$$\n\nFinally, we verify that $d\\pi_p$ restricted to $\\mathcal{H}_p$ is an isometry. Let $E_1 = (X_1, 0)$ and $E_2 = (X_2, 0)$ be two vectors in $\\mathcal{H}_p$. We need to show that $h_b(d\\pi_p(E_1), d\\pi_p(E_2)) = g_p(E_1, E_2)$.\nThe left-hand side is:\n$$h_b(d\\pi_p(E_1), d\\pi_p(E_2)) = h_b(X_1, X_2)$$\nThe right-hand side is:\n$$g_p(E_1, E_2) = g_p((X_1,0), (X_2,0)) = h_b(X_1, X_2) + k_f(0,0) = h_b(X_1, X_2)$$\nSince the two sides are equal, $d\\pi_p|_{\\mathcal{H}_p}$ is an isometry.\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so $\\pi: (M,g) \\to (B,h)$ is a Riemannian submersion.\n\n**Task 2: Show that each fiber is totally geodesic.**\n\nA fiber of the submersion is a set $\\pi^{-1}(b_0) = \\{b_0\\} \\times F$ for some fixed $b_0 \\in B$. This is a submanifold of $M$. The tangent space to this fiber at a point $p=(b_0,f)$ is $\\{0\\} \\times T_f F$, which is precisely the vertical space $\\mathcal{V}_p$.\nA submanifold is totally geodesic if for any two vector fields $U,V$ tangent to it, the covariant derivative $\\nabla_U V$ in the ambient manifold is also tangent to the submanifold. Here, this means that for any two vertical vector fields $U,V$, the vector field $\\nabla_U V$ must also be vertical.\n\nThe Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ on a product manifold $M=B \\times F$ has a specific structure. In local coordinates $(x^i)$ for $B$ and $(y^\\alpha)$ for $F$, a product metric has $g_{ij} = h_{ij}(x)$, $g_{\\alpha\\beta} = k_{\\alpha\\beta}(y)$, and $g_{i\\alpha}=0$. The Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^A_{BC}$ are zero if they mix indices from $B$ and $F$. For example, $\\Gamma_{ij\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_i g_{j\\alpha} + \\partial_j g_{i\\alpha} - \\partial_\\alpha g_{ij}) = 0$ since $g_{ij}$ does not depend on $y^\\alpha$. This leads to the following properties for the connection, where $X,Y$ are horizontal vector fields and $U,V$ are vertical vector fields:\n1. $\\nabla_X Y$ is horizontal.\n2. $\\nabla_U V$ is vertical.\n3. $\\nabla_X U = \\nabla_U X = 0$.\n\nLet $U$ and $V$ be two vertical vector fields. According to property (2) of the product connection, $\\nabla_U V$ is a vertical vector field. This means it is tangent to the fiber. Therefore, each fiber $\\pi^{-1}(b)$ is a totally geodesic submanifold of $M$.\nThe second fundamental form of the fiber is given by $II(U,V) = (\\nabla_U V)^\\mathcal{H}$. Since $\\nabla_U V$ is vertical, its horizontal projection is zero, $(\\nabla_U V)^\\mathcal{H}=0$. Thus, the second fundamental form vanishes, confirming the fiber is totally geodesic.\n\n**Task 3: Compute the O'Neill tensor $T$ and verify it vanishes.**\n\nThe O'Neill tensor $T$ is the second fundamental form of the fibers. For any two vertical vector fields $U, V$, it is defined as $T_U V = (\\nabla_U V)^{\\mathcal{H}}$.\nAs established in the analysis for Task 2, for the Levi-Civita connection on a product manifold, the covariant derivative of two vertical vector fields, $\\nabla_U V$, is always a vertical vector field.\nTherefore, its projection onto the orthogonal horizontal distribution must be zero:\n$$\nT_U V = (\\nabla_U V)^{\\mathcal{H}} = 0\n$$\nThis holds for any vertical vector fields $U,V$. Therefore, the tensor $T$ is identically zero, which confirms that the fibers are totally geodesic submanifolds.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3064111"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to the simple product case [@problem_id:3064111], most Riemannian submersions exhibit a geometric \"twist.\" This practice introduces the celebrated Hopf fibration, the canonical example of a non-trivial submersion, and the fundamental O'Neill tensor $A$, which quantifies this twisting.

We proceed by addressing each of the three tasks in order.\n\nThe first task is to compute the O'Neill tensor component $A_{E_{1}} E_{2}$ and its norm. The vector fields $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ are horizontal by definition. The problem provides the formula for the O'Neill tensor acting on horizontal vector fields $X$ and $Y$ in this specific setting:\n$$\nA_{X} Y = \\frac{1}{2} ([X, Y])^{\\mathcal{V}}\n$$\nwhere $(\\cdot)^{\\mathcal{V}}$ denotes the projection onto the vertical distribution.

Let us denote this curvature by $K(E_{1}, E_{2})$. The problem specifies that the metric $g$ is bi-invariant on the Lie group $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$. For a bi-invariant metric on a Lie group, the sectional curvature of a plane spanned by two orthonormal left-invariant vector fields $X$ and $Y$ is given by the formula:\n$$\nK(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{4} \\|[X, Y]\\|^{2}\n$$\nIn our case, the frame $\\{E_{1}, E_{2}, E_{3}\\}$ is left-invariant and orthonormal.
