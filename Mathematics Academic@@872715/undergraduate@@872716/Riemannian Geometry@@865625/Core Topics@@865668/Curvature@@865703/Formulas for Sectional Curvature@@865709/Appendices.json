The task is to compute the sectional curvature $K(p,\\sigma)$ from foundational definitions. All aspects of the problem are standard constructions in differential geometry. The problem is valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts. First, we compute the sectional curvature on $(T^2, g)$. Second, we justify why this result is consistent with the known properties of tori embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nTo compute the sectional curvature, we leverage the fact that the projection map $\\pi: (\\mathbb{R}^2, g_0) \\to (T^2, g)$ is a local isometry. A local isometry is a diffeomorphism between open sets that preserves the metric. A key property of local isometries is that they preserve the Riemann curvature tensor. Therefore, the curvature of $(T^2, g)$ at any point $p$ is identical to the curvature of $(\\mathbb{R}^2, g_0)$ at any corresponding point $\\tilde{p}$ such that $\\pi(\\tilde{p}) = p$. We can thus compute the curvature on the simpler space, $(\\mathbb{R}^2, g_0)$.\n\nLet $(x^1, x^2)$ be the standard Cartesian coordinates on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The Euclidean metric tensor $g_0$ is given in these coordinates by the matrix $(g_{ij})$, where $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ (the Kronecker delta). That is,\n$$\ng_{11} = 1, \\quad g_{22} = 1, \\quad g_{12} = g_{21} = 0\n$$\nThe components of the metric tensor are constant functions on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThe Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ is characterized by the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$.

Since all components $g_{ij}$ of the Euclidean metric are constant, their partial derivatives are zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^j} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l} = 0\n$$\nfor all indices $i, j, l$. Consequently, all Christoffel symbols are identically zero:\n$$\n\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i, j, k.\n$$\nThis signifies that the covariant derivative with respect to the coordinate vector fields $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}$ is simply the partial derivative. The space $(\\mathbb{R}^2, g_0)$ is a flat space.\n\nNext, we compute the Riemann curvature tensor $R$. Its components $R^l{}_{ijk}$ in a coordinate basis are given by the formula:\n$$\nR^l{}_{ijk} = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^l_{jk}}{\\partial x^i} - \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^l_{ik}}{\\partial x^j} + \\sum_{p=1}^2 \\left( \\Gamma^p_{jk} \\Gamma^l_{ip} - \\Gamma^p_{ik} \\Gamma^l_{jp} \\right)\n$$\nSince all Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are zero, their partial derivatives are also zero. All terms in the formula for $R^l{}_{ijk}$ are zero. Therefore, all components of the Riemann curvature tensor are zero:\n$$\nR^l{}_{ijk} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i, j, k, l.\n$$\nThis means that the Riemann curvature tensor $R$ for $(\\mathbb{R}^2, g_0)$ is the zero tensor.\n\nThe sectional curvature $K(p, \\sigma)$ at a point $p$ for a $2$-dimensional plane $\\sigma \\subset T_p M$ is defined using the Riemann tensor. If $\\{u,v\\}$ is any basis for $\\sigma$, the sectional curvature is given by:\n$$\nK(\\sigma) = \\frac{g(R(u,v)v, u)}{g(u,u)g(v,v) - (g(u,v))^2}\n$$\nSince the Riemann tensor $R$ is the zero tensor on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, we have $R(u,v)v = 0$ for any vector fields $u, v$. Thus, the numerator of the expression for sectional curvature is always zero.\n$$\nK(\\sigma) = \\frac{g(0, u)}{g(u,u)g(v,v) - (g(u,v))^2} = 0\n$$\nThe sectional curvature of Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is identically zero for any plane at any point.\n\nAs established, the canonical projection $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to T^2$ is a local isometry. This implies that the Riemann curvature tensor of $T^2$ is pulled back from the Riemann curvature tensor of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Since the curvature tensor on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is zero, the curvature tensor on $T^2$ must also be zero everywhere. Therefore, the sectional curvature $K(p, \\sigma)$ for any point $p \\in T^2$ and any $2$-plane $\\sigma \\subset T_p T^2$ is also zero. Since $T^2$ is a $2$-dimensional manifold, there is only one possible $2$-plane at each tangent space, namely $T_p T^2$ itself. The sectional curvature in this case is also known as the Gaussian curvature.\n\nThe exact value of the sectional curvature is $0$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for a justification of why this result does not contradict the fact that a standard smooth torus embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (e.g., a surface of revolution of a circle about an axis) has regions of positive and negative Gaussian curvature.\n\nThe justification lies in the distinction between an abstract Riemannian manifold and a submanifold with an induced metric.\n1. The torus $(T^2, g)$ in this problem is an *abstract* Riemannian manifold. Its metric $g$ is defined intrinsically to be locally Euclidean (flat). We have shown its curvature is identically zero. This is often called the \"flat torus\".\n\n2. A standard \"donut-shaped\" torus embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is a $2$-dimensional submanifold of Euclidean $3$-space. Its Riemannian metric is *induced* by the embedding from the ambient metric of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The shape of this embedding dictates the properties of the induced metric.\n\n3. The curvature of a surface embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is governed by the Gauss-Codazzi equations. The Gaussian curvature $K$ (which is the sectional curvature for a surface) is given by $K = \\kappa_1 \\kappa_2$, where $\\kappa_1$ and $\\kappa_2$ are the principal curvatures of the surface (this is Gauss's *Theorema Egregium*). For a standard donut shape, the outer region has $\\kappa_1 > 0$ and $\\kappa_2 > 0$, resulting in positive Gaussian curvature. The inner \"hole\" region has $\\kappa_1 > 0$ and $\\kappa_2 < 0$, resulting in negative Gaussian curvature. The curvature is clearly not constant and not identically zero.\n\n4. The apparent contradiction is resolved by recognizing that the abstract flat torus $(T^2, g)$ is *not* isometrically embeddable as a standard smooth ($C^2$ or higher) surface in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. In other words, the intrinsically flat metric $g$ of the abstract torus is different from the metric induced on a donut-shaped surface in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. While the two spaces are topologically equivalent (they are both homeomorphic to $S^1 \\times S^1$), they are not isometrically equivalent. The fact that the flat torus cannot be smoothly and isometrically embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is a classical result of differential geometry. An embedding that preserves the flat metric would need to be non-smooth (e.g., a $C^1$ embedding, as guaranteed by the Nash-Kuiper theorem, which would be wrinkled or fractal-like).
