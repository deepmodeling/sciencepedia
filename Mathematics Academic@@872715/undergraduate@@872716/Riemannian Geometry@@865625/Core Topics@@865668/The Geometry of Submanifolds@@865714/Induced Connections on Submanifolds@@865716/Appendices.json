All terms like \"induced connection,\" \"second fundamental form,\" and \"mean curvature\" are well-defined within Riemannian geometry. The object of study, a plane in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, is a simple and well-behaved smooth submanifold. The problem is self-contained, mathematically sound, and objective. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We will proceed with a full solution.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe plane $M$ is defined by the equation $x - y + 2z = 5$. This can be written as a level set $f(x,y,z) = 0$ for the function $f(x,y,z) = x - y + 2z - 5$. The gradient of $f$, $\\nabla f = (1, -1, 2)$, is a vector field normal to the plane $M$ at every point.\n\nTo work with geometric quantities, we need a unit normal vector field. The magnitude of the gradient vector is constant:\n$$\n\\|\\nabla f\\| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1 + 4} = \\sqrt{6}\n$$\nThus, a unit normal vector field $\\boldsymbol{n}$ on $M$ is given by:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{n} = \\frac{\\nabla f}{\\|\\nabla f\\|} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}(1, -1, 2)\n$$\nCrucially, $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is a constant vector field on $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nThe relationship between the ambient connection $\\bar{\\nabla}$, the induced connection $\\nabla$ on $M$, and the second fundamental form $\\mathrm{II}$ is given by the Gauss formula. For any vector fields $X, Y$ tangent to $M$, we have:\n$$\n\\bar{\\nabla}_X Y = \\nabla_X Y + \\mathrm{II}(X, Y)\n$$\nHere, $\\nabla_X Y$ is the tangential component of $\\bar{\\nabla}_X Y$ to $M$, and $\\mathrm{II}(X, Y)$ is the normal component.\n\nThe second fundamental form can be related to the shape operator (or Weingarten map) $S_{\\boldsymbol{n}}: T_pM \\to T_pM$ associated with the unit normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$. The defining relation for the shape operator is the Weingarten formula:\n$$\n\\bar{\\nabla}_X \\boldsymbol{n} = -S_{\\boldsymbol{n}}(X) + D_X \\boldsymbol{n}\n$$\nwhere $-S_{\\boldsymbol{n}}(X)$ is the tangential component of $\\bar{\\nabla}_X \\boldsymbol{n}$ and $D_X \\boldsymbol{n}$ is the normal component. The second fundamental form and the shape operator are related by $g(\\mathrm{II}(X, Y), \\boldsymbol{n}) = g(S_{\\boldsymbol{n}}(X), Y)$, where $g$ is the Euclidean metric.\n\nLet us compute $\\bar{\\nabla}_X \\boldsymbol{n}$. In $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with the standard metric, the Levi-Civita connection $\\bar{\\nabla}$ is simply the standard directional derivative of vector fields. Let $X$ be any vector field tangent to $M$. The vector field $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is constant on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The directional derivative of a constant vector field in any direction is the zero vector. Therefore:\n$$\n\\bar{\\nabla}_X \\boldsymbol{n} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Weingarten formula gives:\n$$\n0 = -S_{\\boldsymbol{n}}(X) + D_X \\boldsymbol{n}\n$$\nThe vector $-S_{\\boldsymbol{n}}(X)$ is tangent to $M$ and the vector $D_X \\boldsymbol{n}$ is normal to $M$. For their sum to be the zero vector, both components must be zero. This implies:\n$$\nS_{\\boldsymbol{n}}(X) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } X \\in \\mathfrak{X}(M)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathfrak{X}(M)$ is the set of smooth vector fields on $M$. Thus, the shape operator $S_{\\boldsymbol{n}}$ is the zero map.\n\nNow we can determine the second fundamental form. For any vector fields $X, Y$ tangent to $M$:\n$$\ng(\\mathrm{II}(X, Y), \\boldsymbol{n}) = g(S_{\\boldsymbol{n}}(X), Y) = g(0, Y) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\mathrm{II}(X, Y)$ is by definition a vector in the normal space $N_pM$, and the normal space is one-dimensional and spanned by $\\boldsymbol{n}$, we can write $\\mathrm{II}(X, Y) = \\lambda \\boldsymbol{n}$ for some scalar $\\lambda$. The inner product is then $g(\\lambda \\boldsymbol{n}, \\boldsymbol{n}) = \\lambda g(\\boldsymbol{n}, \\boldsymbol{n}) = \\lambda \\|\\boldsymbol{n}\\|^2 = \\lambda$. Since we found this inner product to be $0$, it follows that $\\lambda = 0$.\nTherefore, for all $X,Y$ tangent to $M$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{II}(X, Y) = 0\n$$\nThe second fundamental form of the plane $M$ is identically zero. This is an expected result, as a plane is a totally geodesic submanifold of Euclidean space; it does not \"bend\" in the ambient space.\n\nFinally, we compute the mean curvature scalar $H$. The mean curvature $H$ is defined as the scaled trace of the shape operator:\n$$\nH = \\frac{1}{\\dim(M)} \\mathrm{tr}(S_{\\boldsymbol{n}})\n$$\nThe dimension of the plane $M$ is $\\dim(M) = 2$. To compute the trace of the shape operator $S_{\\boldsymbol{n}}$, we can use any basis for the tangent space. However, since we have already established that $S_{\\boldsymbol{n}}$ is the zero map (i.e., $S_{\\boldsymbol{n}}(X)=0$ for all $X$), its matrix representation in any basis is the zero matrix. The trace of the zero matrix is $0$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{tr}(S_{\\boldsymbol{n}}) = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the mean curvature is:\n$$\nH = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0 = 0\n$$\nThe mean curvature of the plane $M$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is $0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3051258"}, {"introduction": "After establishing the baseline of a \"flat\" submanifold, we now turn our attention to a surface that genuinely curves within its ambient space.

The calculation will proceed by systematically determining each component of the expression based on the provided definitions.\n\nFirst, we identify the point $p$ on the manifold $M$. The surface $M$ is the image of the map $F:\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ given by $F(x,y) = (x, y, xy)$.

In this case, $T_p M$ is the $xy$-plane.\n\nNow, we find the unit normal vector $n_p$. A normal vector to the tangent plane can be found by taking the cross product of the basis vectors $E_1$ and $E_2$.\n$$\nE_1 \\times E_2 = (1,0,0) \\times (0,1,0) = (0,0,1)\n$$\nThe length of this vector is $\\|(0,0,1)\\| = \\sqrt{0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2} = 1$, so it is already a unit vector. The problem specifies that $n_p$ must be chosen so its third component is positive. The third component of $(0,0,1)$ is $1$, which is positive. Therefore, the unit normal vector is:\n$$\nn_p = (0,0,1)\n$$\n\nThe core of the problem is to compute the second fundamental form $B_p(E_1, E_2)$. By definition, $B(X,Y) = (\\overline{\\nabla}_X Y)^{\\perp}$, where $X$ and $Y$ are tangent vector fields on $M$. We need to compute the vector $\\overline{\\nabla}_{E_1} E_2$.

Then $E_1 = X_1(p)$ and $E_2 = X_2(p)$.\n\nThe ambient connection $\\overline{\\nabla}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is the standard Levi-Civita connection, for which the covariant derivative is the standard directional derivative of the components of a vector field. The value of $\\overline{\\nabla}_{X_1} X_2$ at $p$ (denoted $\\overline{\\nabla}_{E_1} E_2$) is found by differentiating the components of the vector field $X_2$ in the direction of the vector $E_1$.\nWe can extend $X_1$ and $X_2$ to vector fields $\\tilde{X}_1, \\tilde{X}_2$ on $\\mathbb{R}^3$, for instance $\\tilde{X}_1(x,y,z)=(1,0,y)$ and $\\tilde{X}_2(x,y,z)=(0,1,x)$.

Evaluating at $p=(0,0,0)$ gives $\\overline{\\nabla}_{E_1} E_2 = (0,0,1)$.\n\nNow we can compute $B_p(E_1, E_2)$. This is the normal component of $\\overline{\\nabla}_{E_1} E_2$:\n$$\nB_p(E_1, E_2) = (\\overline{\\nabla}_{E_1} E_2)^{\\perp} = \\text{proj}_{(T_pM)^{\\perp}}(\\overline{\\nabla}_{E_1} E_2)\n$$\nThe normal space $(T_pM)^{\\perp}$ is spanned by the unit vector $n_p=(0,0,1)$.

The covariant derivative $\\nabla^M_T T$ represents the intrinsic acceleration of the curve within its own 1-dimensional geometry. For any 1-dimensional manifold, geodesics are paths of constant speed. Since our curve is parametrized by arc length, it has constant speed 1. Therefore, its intrinsic acceleration must be zero.\nAlternatively, we know that $\\nabla^M$ is the Levi-Civita connection on $M$. The vector $\\nabla^M_T T$ must be tangent to $M$, but since $M$ is 1-dimensional, $T_s M$ is spanned by $T(s)$. Thus $\\nabla^M_T T$ must be proportional to $T$. Also, since $\\nabla^M$ is metric-compatible, it preserves inner products:\n$$\n0 = T \\langle T, T \\rangle = \\langle \\nabla^M_T T, T \\rangle + \\langle T, \\nabla^M_T T \\rangle = 2 \\langle \\nabla^M_T T, T \\rangle\n$$\nThis shows that $\\nabla^M_T T$ is orthogonal to $T$.

For a 1-dimensional manifold $M$, an orthonormal basis for the tangent space $T_s M$ consists of the single vector $T(s)$. The trace is therefore the sum over this one basis vector:\n$$\nH = \\mathrm{tr}_g(\\alpha) = \\alpha(T, T)\n$$\nCombining this with our previous result, we find:\n$$\nH = \\nabla_T T\n$$\n\n**Step 5: Relate $H$ to $\\kappa(s)$ and $n(s)$.**\nWe need to express the vector $\\nabla_T T$ in terms of $\\kappa(s)$ and $n(s)$.
