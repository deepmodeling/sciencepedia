That is, for any point $p \\in \\mathbb{T}^{n}$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ that is isometric to an open set in Euclidean space $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{std}})$, where $g_{\\mathrm{std}}$ is the standard Euclidean metric. The Riemann curvature tensor $R$ is a local invariant of the metric. Therefore, the curvature tensor of $(\\mathbb{T}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})$ at any point is identical to the curvature tensor of $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{std}})$.\n\nLet us compute the curvature of $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{std}})$. In the standard Cartesian coordinate system $(x^{1}, \\dots, x^{n})$, the components of the standard metric tensor are given by $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$, the Kronecker delta. These components are constant functions on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nThe Levi-Civita connection coefficients (Christoffel symbols of the second kind) are given by the formula:\n$$\n\\Gamma^{k}_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^{i}} + \\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^{j}} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^{l}} \\right)\n$$\nSince the metric components $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ are constant, all their partial derivatives are zero: $\\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^{i}} = 0$ for all $i,j,l$. Consequently, all Christoffel symbols are identically zero:\n$$\n\\Gamma^{k}_{ij} = 0\n$$\nThe components of the Riemann curvature tensor $R$ are defined in terms of the Christoffel symbols:\n$$\nR^{l}{}_{ijk} = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^{l}_{ik}}{\\partial x^{j}} - \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^{l}_{jk}}{\\partial x^{i}} + \\sum_{p=1}^{n} \\left( \\Gamma^{p}_{ik} \\Gamma^{l}_{pj} - \\Gamma^{p}_{jk} \\Gamma^{l}_{pi} \\right)\n$$\nSince all $\\Gamma^{k}_{ij}$ are zero, all their derivatives are also zero. The products of Christoffel symbols are also zero. Thus, all components of the Riemann curvature tensor are zero:\n$$\nR^{l}{}_{ijk} = 0\n$$\nThis implies that the Riemann curvature tensor $R$ is the zero tensor. For any vector fields $u,v,w$, we have $R(u,v)w = 0$.\n\nThe sectional curvature $K(p, \\sigma)$ for a $2$-plane $\\sigma \\subset T_{p}\\mathbb{T}^{n}$ spanned by linearly independent vectors $u,v$ is given by:\n$$\nK(p,\\sigma) = \\frac{\\langle R(u,v)v,u \\rangle}{\\langle u,u \\rangle \\langle v,v \\rangle - \\langle u,v \\rangle^{2}}\n$$\nSince $R$ is the zero tensor, $R(u,v)v = 0$. The numerator is therefore $\\langle 0, u \\rangle = 0$. The denominator is non-zero because $u$ and $v$ are linearly independent. Thus, the sectional curvature is:\n$$\nK(p,\\sigma) = \\frac{0}{\\langle u,u \\rangle \\langle v,v \\rangle - \\langle u,v \\rangle^{2}} = 0\n$$\nThis holds for any point $p \\in \\mathbb{T}^{n}$ and any $2$-plane $\\sigma \\subset T_{p}\\mathbb{T}^{n}$. The torus $(\\mathbb{T}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})$ is a flat manifold.\n\nPart (b): Justification for $(\\mathbb{T}^{n}, g_{\\varepsilon})$ being a collapsing sequence with bounded curvature.\n\nWe consider the sequence of Riemannian manifolds $(\\mathbb{T}^{n}, g_{\\varepsilon})$ where $g_{\\varepsilon} = \\varepsilon^{2} g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}}$ and $\\varepsilon \\to 0$. We must show two properties: bounded curvature and collapse.\n\n1. Bounded Curvature:\nLet $g = g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}}$ and $\\tilde{g} = g_{\\varepsilon} = \\varepsilon^{2}g$. Let $\\nabla$ and $\\tilde{\\nabla}$ be their respective Levi-Civita connections. The connection is determined by the Koszul formula. For a constant scaling of the metric $\\tilde{g} = c g$ (with $c=\\varepsilon^2$ being a constant), the connection is invariant. Let's verify this.\n$2\\tilde{g}(\\tilde{\\nabla}_{X}Y, Z) = X(\\tilde{g}(Y,Z)) + \\dots = X(c g(Y,Z)) + \\dots = c(X(g(Y,Z)) + \\dots) = c(2g(\\nabla_{X}Y, Z))$.\nSubstituting $\\tilde{g} = c g$ on the left side gives $2cg(\\tilde{\\nabla}_{X}Y, Z) = 2cg(\\nabla_{X}Y, Z)$, which implies $\\tilde{\\nabla}_{X}Y = \\nabla_{X}Y$. The Levi-Civita connection is invariant under constant homothetic scaling.\nThe Riemann curvature tensor is defined as $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_{X}\\nabla_{Y}Z - \\nabla_{Y}\\nabla_{X}Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z$. Since $\\tilde{\\nabla} = \\nabla$, the curvature tensor as a $(1,3)$-tensor field is also invariant: $\\tilde{R}(X,Y)Z = R(X,Y)Z$.\n\nNow we compute the sectional curvature $\\tilde{K}$ for the metric $\\tilde{g}=g_{\\varepsilon}$. Let $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ denote the inner product for $g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}}$ and $\\tilde{\\langle} \\cdot, \\cdot \\tilde{\\rangle}$ denote the inner product for $g_{\\varepsilon}$. So, $\\tilde{\\langle} u,v \\tilde{\\rangle} = \\varepsilon^{2} \\langle u,v \\rangle$.\n$$\n\\tilde{K}(p\n,\\sigma) = \\frac{\\tilde{\\langle} \\tilde{R}(u,v)v,u \\tilde{\\rangle}}{\\tilde{\\langle} u,u \\tilde{\\rangle} \\tilde{\\langle} v,v \\tilde{\\rangle} - \\tilde{\\langle} u,v \\tilde{\\rangle}^{2}}\n$$\nUsing $\\tilde{R}=R$ and $\\tilde{\\langle} \\cdot, \\cdot \\tilde{\\rangle} = \\varepsilon^{2} \\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$, we get:\n$$\n\\tilde{K}(p,\\sigma) = \\frac{\\varepsilon^{2} \\langle R(u,v)v,u \\rangle}{(\\varepsilon^{2}\\langle u,u \\rangle)(\\varepsilon^{2}\\langle v,v \\rangle) - (\\varepsilon^{2}\\langle u,v \\rangle)^{2}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon^{2}}{\\varepsilon^{4}} \\frac{\\langle R(u,v)v,u \\rangle}{\\langle u,u \\rangle\\langle v,v \\rangle - \\langle u,v \\rangle^{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^{2}} K(p,\\sigma)\n$$\nFrom part (a), the sectional curvature of $(\\mathbb{T}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})$ is $K(p,\\sigma) = 0$. Therefore, for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, the sectional curvature of $(\\mathbb{T}^{n}, g_{\\varepsilon})$ is:\n$$\n\\tilde{K}(p,\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^{2}} \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nThe sectional curvature is identically zero for all $\\varepsilon$. Thus, the curvature is bounded, for example by any constant $C \\ge 0$. This satisfies the \"bounded curvature\" condition.\n\n2. Collapsing:\nA sequence of Riemannian manifolds is said to collapse if their volumes tend to zero while their curvatures remain uniformly bounded. We have already established bounded curvature. Now we analyze the volume.\nThe volume form $dV_{g}$ associated with a metric $g$ in local coordinates $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ is $dV_{g} = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} dx^{1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^{n}$.\nFor the metric $g_{\\varepsilon} = \\varepsilon^{2} g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}}$, the matrix of components is $(g_{\\varepsilon})_{ij} = \\varepsilon^{2} (g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})_{ij}$.\nThe determinant is $\\det((g_{\\varepsilon})_{ij}) = \\det(\\varepsilon^{2} (g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})_{ij}) = (\\varepsilon^{2})^{n} \\det((g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})_{ij}) = \\varepsilon^{2n} \\det((g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})_{ij})$.\nTherefore, the volume form scales as:\n$$\ndV_{g_{\\varepsilon}} = \\sqrt{\\varepsilon^{2n} \\det((g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})_{ij})} \\, d^n x = \\varepsilon^{n} \\sqrt{\\det((g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})_{ij})} \\, d^n x = \\varepsilon^{n} dV_{g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}}}\n$$\nThe volume of the manifold is the integral of its volume form:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Vol}(\\mathbb{T}^{n}, g_{\\varepsilon}) = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^{n}} dV_{g_{\\varepsilon}} = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^{n}} \\varepsilon^{n} dV_{g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}}} = \\varepsilon^{n} \\mathrm{Vol}(\\mathbb{T}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})\n$$\nThe volume of the standard flat torus $(\\mathbb{T}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}})$ is the volume of the fundamental domain $[0,1]^{n}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, which is $1$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Vol}(\\mathbb{T}^{n}, g_{\\varepsilon}) = \\varepsilon^{n} \\cdot 1 = \\varepsilon^{n}\n$$\nAs $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the volume $\\mathrm{Vol}(\\mathbb{T}^{n}, g_{\\varepsilon}) = \\varepsilon^{n} \\to 0$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nSince the sequence of manifolds $(\\mathbb{T}^{n}, g_{\\varepsilon})$ has uniformly bounded sectional curvature (identically zero) and their volumes tend to zero, it is, by definition, a collapsing sequence with bounded curvature. The sequence collapses to a point in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense, as can be seen by observing that the diameter, $\\mathrm{diam}(\\mathbb{T}^{n}, g_{\\varepsilon}) = \\varepsilon \\cdot \\mathrm{diam}(\\mathbb{T}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{Eucl}}) = \\varepsilon \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}$, also tends to zero.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3041444"}, {"introduction": "The condition of \"bounded curvature\" is what makes collapsing theory so powerful and structured; without it, a manifold can degenerate in wild and unpredictable ways.

I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nEach statement will be analyzed based on first principles of Riemannian geometry.\n\n**A. Analysis of the prolate ellipsoids**\n\nThe family of manifolds is given by the prolate ellipsoids $E_\\varepsilon=\\left\\{(x,y,z)\\in\\mathbb{R}^3:\\ \\frac{x^2+y^2}{\\varepsilon^2}+\\frac{z^2}{L^2}=1\\right\\}$ with the metric induced from the ambient Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n1.  **Gromov-Hausdorff Collapse:** As $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the ellipsoid becomes long and thin, resembling a \"needle\" along the $z$-axis. The range of the $z$-coordinate is $[-L,L]$. The distance between any two points on the ellipsoid becomes arbitrarily close to the distance between their projections on the $z$-axis. Specifically, the projection map $\\pi: E_\\varepsilon \\to [-L,L]$ given by $\\pi(x,y,z) = z$ is a Gromov-Hausdorff approximation. The fibers $\\pi^{-1}(z)$ are circles of radius $\\varepsilon\\sqrt{1-z^2/L^2}$, whose diameters go to $0$ as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$. Thus, $(E_\\varepsilon, d_{g_\\varepsilon})$ GH-converges to the segment $[-L,L]$ with its standard metric. This claim is correct.\n\n2.  **Ricci Curvature:** The ellipsoid $E_\\varepsilon$ is a closed, convex surface in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The Gaussian curvature $K$ of a convex surface is everywhere non-negative ($K \\ge 0$). For a $2$-dimensional manifold, the Ricci curvature tensor is given by $\\text{Ric} = K g$. Since $K \\ge 0$, the Ricci curvature is non-negative. This claim is correct.\n\n3.  **Maximal Sectional Curvature:** For a surface in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the sectional curvature is the Gaussian curvature $K$. We can parametrize the surface of revolution by $z \\in (-L,L)$ and the azimuthal angle. The radial function is $r(z) = \\varepsilon\\sqrt{1-z^2/L^2}$. The Gaussian curvature for a surface of revolution defined by $r(z)$ is given by the formula $K = \\frac{-r''(z)}{r(z)(1+(r'(z))^2)^2}$. A more convenient formula gives $K$ in terms of the principal curvatures. For an ellipsoid defined by $\\frac{x^2+y^2}{a^2} + \\frac{z^2}{c^2}=1$, the Gaussian curvature is $K = \\frac{c^2}{(c^2(x^2+y^2)+a^2 z^2)^2 a^4 / c^4}$. A simpler formula for a surface of revolution is $K = \\frac{L^4}{(L^4 - (L^2-\\varepsilon^2)z^2)^2}$. In our case, $a=\\varepsilon$ and $c=L$. The expression for the Gaussian curvature is $K(z) = \\frac{L^4}{(L^2(L^2-z^2)+\\varepsilon^2z^2)^2}$.\nTo find the maximal curvature, we must minimize the denominator. The denominator is a quadratic in $z^2$. For $\\varepsilon < L$, the term $L^2-\\varepsilon^2$ is positive, so the coefficient of $z^2$ is negative. The minimum of the denominator occurs at the maximal value of $|z|$, i.e., at the poles $z = \\pm L$.\nAt $z=\\pm L$, the curvature is:\n$$ K(z=\\pm L) = \\frac{L^4}{(L^2(L^2-L^2)+\\varepsilon^2L^2)^2} = \\frac{L^4}{(\\varepsilon^2L^2)^2} = \\frac{L^4}{\\varepsilon^4L^4} = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^4} $$\nAs $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the maximal sectional curvature $\\max K = 1/\\varepsilon^4 \\to +\\infty$. This claim is correct.\n\nAll parts of statement A are correct. Therefore, **A is Correct**.\n\n**B. Analysis of collapsing $\\mathbb{S}^2$ with bounded curvature**\n\nThe statement claims the existence of a smooth family of metrics $g_\\varepsilon$ on the $2$-sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$ that collapses to a segment $[0,L]$ while maintaining a uniform sectional curvature bound $|\\sec_{g_\\varepsilon}| \\le C$.\n\nA fundamental result in collapsing theory (due to Cheeger, Fukaya, and Gromov) states that if a sequence of closed Riemannian $n$-manifolds $(M_i, g_i)$ has uniformly bounded sectional curvature and collapses to a $k$-dimensional space $X$ ($k<n$), then for large $i$, $M_i$ admits an $F$-structure, which is a sheaf of local Killing vector fields from a torus $T^{n-k}$ that acts locally isometrically. This implies that the manifold has the structure of a fibration (or more generally, a Seifert fibration) over the limit space.\n\nIn this case, $M=\\mathbb{S}^2$ ($n=2$) and the limit space is an interval $[0,L]$ ($k=1$). The dimension drop is $n-k=1$, so the fibers would have to be $1$-dimensional, i.e., circles. This would imply that $\\mathbb{S}^2$ fibers over an interval with circle fibers. A circle bundle over an interval is either a cylinder, $\\mathbb{S}^1 \\times [0,1]$, or a Möbius strip. Neither of these topological spaces is homeomorphic to the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$.\n\nAlternatively, consider a rotationally symmetric metric on $\\mathbb{S}^2$ of the form $g = dz^2 + f(z)^2 d\\theta^2$ for $z \\in [0,L]$. For this metric to be smooth at the poles $z=0$ and $z=L$, the function $f(z)$ must satisfy $f(0)=0, f'(0)=1$ and $f(L)=0, f'(L)=-1$. These are the conditions to avoid conical singularities.\nCollapsing to the segment $[0,L]$ requires that the \"circumference\" of the sphere tends to $0$, which means $\\sup_{z \\in [0,L]} f(z) \\to 0$. However, the condition $f'(0)=1$ fixes the scale of $f(z)$ near $z=0$ (since $f(z) \\approx z$ for small $z$), preventing $f(z)$ from uniformly approaching $0$. It is impossible to satisfy both $f'(0)=1$ and $\\sup f(z) \\to 0$.\n\nThus, the topology of $\\mathbb{S}^2$ and the conditions for smoothness of a metric at the poles of a surface of revolution prevent such a collapse with bounded curvature. **B is Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Analysis of the flat cylinders**\n\nThe family of manifolds is $M_\\varepsilon = \\mathbb{S}^1_\\varepsilon \\times [0-L]$, where $\\mathbb{S}^1_\\varepsilon$ is a circle of length $2\\pi\\varepsilon$. Let's model this as the quotient of $[0, 2\\pi\\varepsilon] \\times [0,L]$ by identifying points $(0,z)$ with $(2\\pi\\varepsilon,z)$. The product flat metric can be written as $g_\\varepsilon = d\\theta^2 + dz^2$, where $\\theta$ is a coordinate on $\\mathbb{S}^1_\\varepsilon$ with range $[0, 2\\pi\\varepsilon]$. Alternatively using a standard angle $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi]$, the metric is $g_\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon^2d\\phi^2+dz^2$.\n\n1.  **Curvature:** This is a product of two flat spaces, so the resulting metric is flat. Its sectional curvature is identically $0$. The Ricci curvature is also identically $0$. Since $0$ is non-negative, the claim about non-negative Ricci curvature is true.\n\n2.  **Gromov-Hausdorff Collapse:** We are checking if $(\\mathbb{S}^1_\\varepsilon \\times [0,L], g_\\varepsilon)$ converges to $([0,L], d_{std})$ in the GH sense. The projection map $p: \\mathbb{S}^1_\\varepsilon \\times [0,L] \\to [0,L]$ defined by $p(\\theta, z) = z$ is a Riemannian submersion. The fibers are the circles $\\mathbb{S}^1_\\varepsilon \\times \\{z\\}$, which have diameter $\\pi\\varepsilon$. As $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the diameter of the fibers tends to $0$. This is the canonical condition for GH-collapse to the base space. Therefore, the family of cylinders collapses to the segment $[0,L]$ as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$.\n\nAll parts of statement C are correct. The description \"cylinders with boundary\" is accurate for $\\mathbb{S}^1_\\varepsilon \\times [0,L]$. **C is Correct**.\n\n**D. Analysis of the Berger metrics on $\\mathbb{S}^3$**\n\nBerger metrics are a standard one-parameter family of metrics on the $3$-sphere, $\\mathbb{S}^3$. They are constructed using the Hopf fibration $\\mathbb{S}^1 \\to \\mathbb{S}^3 \\to \\mathbb{S}^2$. The standard round metric on $\\mathbb{S}^3$ can be decomposed into a component along the $\\mathbb{S}^1$ fibers and a component on the base $\\mathbb{S}^2$. The Berger metric $g_\\varepsilon$ is obtained by scaling the fiber component by a factor of $\\varepsilon^2$.\n\n1.  **Gromov-Hausdorff Collapse:** As the parameter $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the metric along the $\\mathbb{S}^1$ fibers shrinks. This causes the fibers, which are circles, to collapse to points. The limit space of this collapse is the base space of the fibration, which is the $2$-sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$. The statement claims the collapse is to a *segment*. This is factually incorrect. The limit space is two-dimensional, not one-dimensional.\n\n2.  **Sectional Curvature:** The sectional curvatures of the Berger sphere can be calculated using O'Neill's formulas. For planes tangent to the base space (horizontal planes), the curvature approaches a positive constant as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$. For planes containing the fiber direction (mixed planes), the curvature is proportional to $\\varepsilon^2$ and thus goes to $0$. The curvatures remain uniformly bounded as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$. So, the claim about uniformly bounded sectional curvature is correct.\n\nHowever, since the primary claim about the limit space being a segment is false, the entire statement is incorrect. **D is Incorrect**.\n\n### Summary of anlysis\n- Option A is correct.\n- Option B is incorrect.\n- Option C is correct.\n- Option D is incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "3041382"}, {"introduction": "The statement that a sequence of spaces \"collapses\" to a limit space is made precise by the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, which measures how \"far apart\" two metric spaces are.

Its distortion is\n$$\n\\operatorname{dis}(\\mathcal{R}) = \\sup\\left\\{\\,\\big|d_{X}(x,x') - d_{Y}(y,y')\\big| : (x,y),(x',y') \\in \\mathcal{R}\\,\\right\\}.\n$$\n- The Gromov–Hausdorff distance between compact metric spaces can be defined by\n$$\nd_{\\mathrm{GH}}(X,Y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\inf_{\\mathcal{R}} \\operatorname{dis}(\\mathcal{R}),\n$$\nwhere the infimum is over all correspondences $\\mathcal{R}$ between $X$ and $Y$.\n\nConstruct a natural correspondence using the projection $S^{1}_{\\varepsilon} \\times S^{1} \\to S^{1}$ onto the second factor, bound its distortion explicitly, and conclude an upper bound on $d_{\\mathrm{GH}}(X,Y)$ in terms of $\\varepsilon$. Express your final bound as a single closed-form analytic expression in $\\varepsilon$. No numerical approximation or rounding is required.", "solution": "The objective is to find an upper bound for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance $d_{\\mathrm{GH}}(X,Y)$ between the flat torus $(X,g_{\\varepsilon})$ and the unit circle $(Y,g_{1})$. The problem specifies that this estimate must be derived by constructing a particular correspondence based on the projection from $X$ to $Y$ and then calculating its distortion.\n\nLet $X$ be the $2$-torus $S^{1}_{\\varepsilon} \\times S^{1}$ with coordinates $(\\theta, \\phi) \\in [0, 2\\pi) \\times [0, 2\\pi)$. The Riemannian metric on $X$ is given by $g_{\\varepsilon} = \\varepsilon^{2} d\\theta^{2} + d\\phi^{2}$. The space $Y$ is the unit circle $S^{1}$ with its standard metric. The problem provides the following definitions which we shall use exclusively.\n\nThe geodesic distance on $X$ between points $x_1 = (\\theta_1, \\phi_1)$ and $x_2 = (\\theta_2, \\phi_2)$ is\n$$d_{X}(x_1, x_2) = \\min_{k,m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\sqrt{\\varepsilon^{2}(\\theta_2-\\theta_1+2\\pi k)^{2} + (\\phi_2-\\phi_1+2\\pi m)^{2}}.$$\nThe metric on $X$ is a product metric. Therefore, the squared distance on the torus is the sum of the squared distances on the component circles. The distance on a circle of radius $r$ between angles $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ is $d_{S^{1}_{r}}(\\alpha, \\beta) = r \\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |\\alpha-\\beta+2\\pi k|$. The first circle $S^{1}_{\\varepsilon}$ has radius $\\varepsilon$ and the second circle $S^{1}$ has radius $1$. Thus, we can write the distance on $X$ as\n$$d_{X}(x_1, x_2) = \\sqrt{d_{S^{1}_{\\varepsilon}}(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)^2 + d_{S^{1}_{1}}(\\phi_1, \\phi_2)^2}.$$\nThe space $Y$ is the unit circle $S^{1}$ with radius $1$. We can identify $Y$ with the second factor of $X$. The distance between two points in $Y$, represented by angles $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$, is $d_{Y}(\\psi_1, \\psi_2) = d_{S^{1}_{1}}(\\psi_1, \\psi_2)$.\n\nFollowing the problem's directive, we construct a correspondence $\\mathcal{R} \\subset X \\times Y$ using the projection map $\\pi: X \\to Y$ defined by $\\pi((\\theta, \\phi)) = \\phi$. The correspondence is the graph of this projection:\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\{ (x, y) \\in X \\times Y \\mid y = \\pi(x) \\}.$$\nIn coordinates, this is $\\mathcal{R} = \\{ ((\\theta, \\phi), \\phi) \\mid \\theta, \\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi) \\}$.\nThis set $\\mathcal{R}$ is a valid correspondence because its projection onto $X$ is surjective (for any $x \\in X$, $(x, \\pi(x)) \\in \\mathcal{R}$), and its projection onto $Y$ is also surjective (for any $y \\in Y$, we can choose any $\\theta_0 \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ to form $x_0 = (\\theta_0, y)$, and then $(x_0, y) \\in \\mathcal{R}$).\n\nNext, we compute the distortion of this correspondence $\\mathcal{R}$. The distortion is defined as:\n$$\\operatorname{dis}(\\mathcal{R}) = \\sup\\left\\{\\,\\big|d_{X}(x_1,x_2) - d_{Y}(y_1,y_2)\\big| : (x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2) \\in \\mathcal{R}\\,\\right\\}.$$\nLet $(x_1, y_1) = ((\\theta_1, \\phi_1), \\phi_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = ((\\theta_2, \\phi_2), \\phi_2)$ be two arbitrary pairs in $\\mathcal{R}$.\nThe distance between $x_1$ and $x_2$ in $X$ is\n$$d_{X}(x_1, x_2) = \\sqrt{d_{S^{1}_{\\varepsilon}}(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)^2 + d_{S^{1}_{1}}(\\phi_1, \\phi_2)^2}.$$\nThe distance between $y_1$ and $y_2$ in $Y$ is\n$$d_{Y}(y_1, y_2) = d_{S^{1}_{1}}(\\phi_1, \\phi_2).$$\nLet us introduce simpler notation for the component distances. Let $A = d_{S^{1}_{\\varepsilon}}(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)$ and $B = d_{S^{1}_{1}}(\\phi_1, \\phi_2)$. The values of $A$ can range over the interval $[0, \\pi\\varepsilon]$ (as the maximum distance on a circle of radius $\\varepsilon$ is half its circumference). Similarly, the values of $B$ can range over $[0, \\pi]$.\nThe expression for the distortion becomes the supremum of\n$$|\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} - B|.$$\nSince $A = d_{S^{1}_{\\varepsilon}}(\\theta_1, \\theta_2) \\ge 0$, we have $\\sqrt{A^2+B^2} \\ge \\sqrt{B^2} = B$. Therefore, the expression inside the absolute value is always non-negative, and we can drop the absolute value bars. We need to find\n$$\\sup_{A \\in [0, \\pi\\varepsilon], B \\in [0, \\pi]} (\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} - B).$$\nLet $f(A,B) = \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} - B$. We analyze this function over the compact domain $[0, \\pi\\varepsilon] \\times [0, \\pi]$.\nFirst, let's fix $B$ and consider $f$ as a function of $A$. The partial derivative with respect to $A$ is\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial A} = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{A^2+B^2}}.$$\nFor $A > 0$, this derivative is positive, so $f(A,B)$ is a strictly increasing function of $A$. Thus, for any fixed $B$, the maximum value is attained when $A$ is maximal, i.e., $A = \\pi\\varepsilon$.\nNow we need to find the maximum of the function $g(B) = f(\\pi\\varepsilon, B) = \\sqrt{(\\pi\\varepsilon)^2 + B^2} - B$ for $B \\in [0, \\pi]$. The derivative of $g(B)$ is\n$$g'(B) = \\frac{B}{\\sqrt{(\\pi\\varepsilon)^2 + B^2}} - 1 = \\frac{B - \\sqrt{(\\pi\\varepsilon)^2 + B^2}}{\\sqrt{(\\pi\\varepsilon)^2 + B^2}}.$$\nSince $\\varepsilon > 0$, we have $(\\pi\\varepsilon)^2 > 0$, which implies $\\sqrt{(\\pi\\varepsilon)^2 + B^2} > \\sqrt{B^2} = B$. Thus, the numerator is negative, and $g'(B) < 0$ for all $B \\ge 0$. This means $g(B)$ is a strictly decreasing function of $B$.\nThe maximum value of $g(B)$ on the interval $[0, \\pi]$ is therefore attained at the left endpoint, $B=0$.\nThe maximum value is $g(0) = \\sqrt{(\\pi\\varepsilon)^2 + 0^2} - 0 = \\pi\\varepsilon$.\nThis confirms that the supremum of $f(A,B)$ over the domain is $\\pi\\varepsilon$.\nTherefore, the distortion of our chosen correspondence is\n$$\\operatorname{dis}(\\mathcal{R}) = \\pi\\varepsilon.$$\nThe Gromov-Hausdorff distance is defined as $d_{\\mathrm{GH}}(X,Y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\inf_{\\mathcal{R}} \\operatorname{dis}(\\mathcal{R})$, where the infimum is taken over all possible correspondences. By computing the distortion for a specific correspondence, we obtain an upper bound for the infimum:\n$$\\inf_{\\mathcal{R}'} \\operatorname{dis}(\\mathcal{R}') \\le \\operatorname{dis}(\\mathcal{R}) = \\pi\\varepsilon.$$\nThis leads to an upper bound for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance:\n$$d_{\\mathrm{GH}}(X,Y) \\le \\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{dis}(\\mathcal{R}) = \\frac{\\pi\\varepsilon}{2}.$$\nThis expression is the required estimate, a closed-form analytic expression in $\\varepsilon$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi\\varepsilon}{2}}$$", "id": "3041390"}]}
