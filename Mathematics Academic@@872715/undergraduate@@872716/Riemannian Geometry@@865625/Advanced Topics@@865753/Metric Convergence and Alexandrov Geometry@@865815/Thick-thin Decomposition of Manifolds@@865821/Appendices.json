A simple closed geodesic $\\gamma$ on $S$ of length $l$ lifts to a geodesic axis $A$ in the universal cover $\\mathbb{H}^2$. The element $g \\in \\pi_1(S)$ corresponding to $\\gamma$ acts on $\\mathbb{H}^2$ as a hyperbolic isometry (a deck transformation) with translation length $l$ along its axis $A$.\n\n**Part 1: The geodesic $\\gamma$ in the $\\varepsilon_2$-thin part**\n\nBy definition, a point $p \\in S$ is in the $\\varepsilon_2$-thin part, $S_{\\varepsilon_2}$, if its injectivity radius $\\operatorname{inj}(p)  \\varepsilon_2$.\nFor any point $p$ on the geodesic $\\gamma$ itself, the shortest non-trivial closed loop based at $p$ is $\\gamma$. The corresponding deck transformation is $g$. The distance a point on the axis of a hyperbolic translation is moved is simply the translation length $l$. So, for a point $\\tilde{p} \\in A$ that projects to $p \\in \\gamma$, we have $d(\\tilde{p}, g \\cdot \\tilde{p}) = l$. The injectivity radius is then $\\operatorname{inj}(p) = \\frac{1}{2} d(\\tilde{p}, g \\cdot \\tilde{p}) = l/2$.\nThe condition for $p \\in \\gamma$ to be in the thin part is $\\operatorname{inj}(p)  \\varepsilon_2$, which translates to $l/2  \\varepsilon_2$, or $l  2\\varepsilon_2$. The problem statement assumes $l  2\\operatorname{arcsinh}(1)$, which is exactly $l  2\\varepsilon_2$. Therefore, every point on the geodesic $\\gamma$ lies in the $\\varepsilon_2$-thin part of the surface.\nFurthermore, the provided statement of the Margulis Lemma asserts that for $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_2$, the thin part $S_{\\varepsilon_2}$ is a union of collars around simple closed geodesics of length $ 2\\varepsilon_2$. Since $\\gamma$ satisfies this length condition, it must be the core geodesic of one such collar.\n\n**Part 2: The half-width of the $\\varepsilon_2$-thin collar**\n\nA collar around $\\gamma$ is a neighborhood of $\\gamma$. Let's consider a point $p \\in S$ in the collar of $\\gamma$ and let $\\tilde{p} \\in \\mathbb{H}^2$ be a lift of $p$. The collar is the set of points where the injectivity radius is determined by the geodesic $\\gamma$. Let $t$ be the hyperbolic distance from $\\tilde{p}$ to the axis $A$ of the deck transformation $g$. For points sufficiently close to the axis, the injectivity radius is given by $\\operatorname{inj}(p) = \\frac{1}{2} d(\\tilde{p}, g \\cdot \\tilde{p})$. Let's denote this displacement distance by $d_g(t) = d(\\tilde{p}, g \\cdot \\tilde{p})$.\n\nThe boundary of the $\\varepsilon_2$-thin collar is defined as the set of points $p$ where $\\operatorname{inj}(p) = \\varepsilon_2$. The half-width of the collar, $t_{\\varepsilon_2}(l)$, is the distance $t$ for which this condition holds.\nSo, we must solve:\n$$ \\operatorname{inj}(p) = \\frac{1}{2} d_g(t_{\\varepsilon_2}(l)) = \\varepsilon_2 $$\n$$ d_g(t_{\\varepsilon_2}(l)) = 2\\varepsilon_2 $$\nThe displacement $d_g(t)$ of a point at normal distance $t$ from the axis of a hyperbolic translation of length $l$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\cosh(d_g(t)) = \\cosh(l) + \\sinh^2(t)(\\cosh(l) - 1) $$\nUsing the identity $\\cosh(l) - 1 = 2\\sinh^2(l/2)$, this becomes:\n$$ \\cosh(d_g(t)) = \\cosh(l) + 2\\sinh^2(t)\\sinh^2(l/2) $$\nWe set $d_g(t) = 2\\varepsilon_2$. We need to evaluate $\\cosh(2\\varepsilon_2)$.\nGiven $\\varepsilon_2 = \\operatorname{arcsinh}(1)$, we have $\\sinh(\\varepsilon_2) = 1$.\nFrom the identity $\\cosh^2(x) - \\sinh^2(x) = 1$, we find $\\cosh(\\varepsilon_2) = \\sqrt{1 + \\sinh^2(\\varepsilon_2)} = \\sqrt{1 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}$.\nUsing the double-angle formula for hyperbolic cosine, $\\cosh(2x) = 2\\cosh^2(x) - 1$, we get:\n$$ \\cosh(2\\varepsilon_2) = 2(\\sqrt{2})^2 - 1 = 2(2) - 1 = 3 $$\nSubstituting this into our equation for the boundary of the collar:\n$$ 3 = \\cosh(l) + 2\\sinh^2(t_{\\varepsilon_2}(l))\\sinh^2(l/2) $$\nNow, we solve for $t_{\\varepsilon_2}(l)$:\n$$ 2\\sinh^2(t_{\\varepsilon_2}(l))\\sinh^2(l/2) = 3 - \\cosh(l) $$\n$$ \\sinh^2(t_{\\varepsilon_2}(l)) = \\frac{3 - \\cosh(l)}{2\\sinh^2(l/2)} $$\nSince $t_{\\varepsilon_2}(l)  0$, we take the positive square root:\n$$ \\sinh(t_{\\varepsilon_2}(l)) = \\sqrt{\\frac{3 - \\cosh(l)}{2\\sinh^2(l/2)}} $$\nThis expression is valid for $l  \\operatorname{arccosh}(3) = 2\\varepsilon_2$, which is the condition for $\\gamma$ to be in a thin part.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Estimation for $l=1.6$**\n\nWe substitute $l = 1.6$ into the derived formula.\n$l/2 = 0.8$.\n$\\cosh(1.6) \\approx 2.57746491$\n$\\sinh(0.8) \\approx 0.88810598$\n$\\sinh^2(0.8) \\approx (0.88810598)^2 \\approx 0.78873302$\n$$ \\sinh^2(t_{\\varepsilon_2}(1.6)) = \\frac{3 - 2.57746491}{2 \\times 0.78873302} = \\frac{0.42253509}{1.57746604} \\approx 0.267859 $$\n$$ \\sinh(t_{\\varepsilon_2}(1.6)) = \\sqrt{0.267859} \\approx 0.517551 $$\n$$ t_{\\varepsilon_2}(1.6) = \\operatorname{arcsinh}(0.517551) = \\ln(0.517551 + \\sqrt{0.517551^2 + 1}) $$\n$$ t_{\\varepsilon_2}(1.6) \\approx \\ln(0.517551 + \\sqrt{0.267859 + 1}) \\approx \\ln(0.517551 + \\sqrt{1.267859}) $$\n$$ t_{\\varepsilon_2}(1.6) \\approx \\ln(0.517551 + 1.1260) \\approx \\ln(1.643551) \\approx 0.49685 $$\nRounding to two decimal places, $t_{\\varepsilon_2}(1.6) \\approx 0.50$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. By setting the displacement $d_{\\gamma}(t)$ under the hyperbolic translation of length $l$ equal to $2\\varepsilon_{2}$ and using the identity $\\cosh(d_{\\gamma}(t)) = \\cosh(l) + 2\\sinh^{2}(l/2)\\,\\sinh^{2}(t)$, the $\\varepsilon_{2}$-thin collar consists of points with $t  t_{\\varepsilon_{2}}(l)$ where $\\sinh(t_{\\varepsilon_{2}}(l)) = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{3 - \\cosh(l)}{2\\sinh^{2}(l/2)}}$. For $l = 1.6$, this yields $t_{\\varepsilon_{2}}(1.6) \\approx 0.50$.**\n- The reasoning for setting $d_{\\gamma}(t) = 2\\varepsilon_{2}$ is correct.\n- The formula for $\\cosh(d_{\\gamma}(t))$ is correct.\n- The derived expression for $\\sinh(t_{\\varepsilon_{2}}(l))$ is correct, resulting from substituting $\\cosh(2\\varepsilon_2) = 3$.\n- The numerical estimate $t_{\\varepsilon_{2}}(1.6) \\approx 0.50$ is correct.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The collar lemma implies $\\sinh(w)\\,\\sinh(l/2) = 1$, so taking $w = \\varepsilon_{2}$ directly shows the geodesic lies in the thin part; for $l = 1.6$ this gives $w \\approx 0.88$.**\n- This option confuses the width $w$ of the maximal embedded collar given by the collar lemma with the half-width $t_{\\varepsilon_2}(l)$ of the $\\varepsilon_2$-thin part collar. These are different quantities. The formula $\\sinh(w)\\sinh(l/2)=1$ defines $w$, not $t_{\\varepsilon_2}(l)$.\n- The assertion that taking $w = \\varepsilon_2$ shows the geodesic is thin is arbitrary. For $l=1.6$, $l/2=0.8$, and $\\varepsilon_2 = \\operatorname{arcsinh}(1) \\approx 0.8814$. We have $\\sinh(\\varepsilon_2)\\sinh(l/2) = 1 \\cdot \\sinh(0.8) \\approx 0.888 \\neq 1$. The identity is not satisfied by setting $w=\\varepsilon_2$. The number $0.88$ is just the approximate value of $\\varepsilon_2$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The thin width is given by $w = \\operatorname{arcsinh}\\!\\big(1/\\sinh(l/2)\\big)$, which for $l = 1.6$ equals $0.97$, because points in the collar have injectivity radius equal to $l/2$.**\n- The formula $w = \\operatorname{arcsinh}(1/\\sinh(l/2))$ is from the collar lemma, as in option B, and does not give the width of the $\\varepsilon_2$-thin collar.\n- The justification \"because points in the collar have injectivity radius equal to $l/2$\" is false. Only points on the geodesic $\\gamma$ itself have $\\operatorname{inj}(p)=l/2$. For points at distance $t0$ from $\\gamma$, the injectivity radius (as determined by $\\gamma$) is larger.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Since the Margulis constant in dimension two is $\\varepsilon_{2} = 1$, any geodesic of length $l  2$ lies in the thin part, with thin half-width $(2 - l)/2$, yielding $0.20$ for $l = 1.6$.**\n- The value of the Margulis constant is stated as $\\varepsilon_2=1$. This is incorrect. The correct value is $\\varepsilon_2 = \\operatorname{arcsinh}(1) \\approx 0.8814$.\n- The formula for the half-width, $(2-l)/2$, is not based on hyperbolic geometry principles. It appears to be an ad-hoc linear approximation with no geometric justification. The correct formula involves hyperbolic functions.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3079210"}]}
