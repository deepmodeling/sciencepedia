All terms are standard. The premise that a torus $T^n_\\Lambda$ can be endowed with a flat metric induced from its universal covering space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a foundational concept. The question asks for a direct computation of the order of the holonomy group based on first principles, which is a standard and solvable problem. The problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. No flaws are detected.\n\n### Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem is to determine the order of the holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(T^{n}_{\\Lambda}, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}})$ of the $n$-torus $T^{n}_{\\Lambda} = \\mathbb{R}^{n} / \\Lambda$ endowed with the flat metric $g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}$ induced from the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The holonomy group at a point $p \\in T^{n}_{\\Lambda}$ is the group of linear isometries of the tangent space $T_{p}T^{n}_{\\Lambda}$ generated by parallel transport along all piecewise smooth loops based at $p$.\n\nThe key to this problem lies in the relationship between the torus and its universal covering space, $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathbb{R}^n})$, where $g_{\\mathbb{R}^n}$ is the standard Euclidean metric. The projection map $\\pi : \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to T^{n}_{\\Lambda}$ is a Riemannian covering map, which means it is a local isometry. This allows us to analyze parallel transport on the torus by lifting paths and vector fields to the covering space.\n\nLet $\\tilde{\\nabla}$ be the Levi-Civita connection on $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathbb{R}^n})$. In the standard Cartesian coordinate system $\\{x^i\\}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the components of the Euclidean metric tensor are constant ($g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$). The Christoffel symbols, given by the formula $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{kl}(\\partial_i g_{jl} + \\partial_j g_{il} - \\partial_l g_{ij})$, are all identically zero.\nThis implies that the covariant derivative of a vector field $Y$ with respect to a vector field $X$ is simply the directional derivative:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nabla}_{X}Y = X(Y)\n$$\nLet $\\tilde{\\gamma}: [0, 1] \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be a smooth path in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. A vector field $\\tilde{V}(t)$ along $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ is parallel if $\\tilde{\\nabla}_{\\tilde{\\gamma}'(t)}\\tilde{V}(t) = 0$. In Cartesian coordinates, if $\\tilde{V}(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^n v^i(t) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}$, this condition becomes $\\frac{dv^i}{dt} = 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. This means that a vector is parallel-transported in Euclidean space if and only if its components in the standard basis remain constant. Consequently, the parallel transport map $\\tilde{P}_{\\tilde{\\gamma}}: T_{\\tilde{\\gamma}(0)}\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to T_{\\tilde{\\gamma}(1)}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is simply the canonical identification of the tangent spaces, which can be viewed as the identity map on the vector components. The curvature tensor of $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathbb{R}^n})$ is identically zero, which is the defining characteristic of a flat manifold.\n\nNow, consider a loop $\\gamma: [0, 1] \\to T^{n}_{\\Lambda}$ based at $p$, i.e., $\\gamma(0) = \\gamma(1) = p$. Let $v \\in T_{p}T^{n}_{\\Lambda}$ be a tangent vector. The holonomy group is generated by the transformations $P_{\\gamma}: T_p T^n_\\Lambda \\to T_p T^n_\\Lambda$ which map $v$ to its parallel transport along $\\gamma$. We can compute $P_{\\gamma}$ by lifting the problem to the covering space $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nLet $\\tilde{p}$ be a point in the fiber over $p$, i.e., $\\pi(\\tilde{p}) = p$. By the path lifting property of covering spaces, there exists a unique path $\\tilde{\\gamma}: [0, 1] \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that $\\tilde{\\gamma}(0) = \\tilde{p}$ and $\\pi \\circ \\tilde{\\gamma} = \\gamma$. Since $\\gamma$ is a loop, its endpoint $\\gamma(1)=p$, so the endpoint of the lifted path $\\tilde{\\gamma}(1)$ must lie in the fiber over $p$. Any point in this fiber can be written as $\\tilde{p}+\\lambda$ for some $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda$. Thus, $\\tilde{\\gamma}(1) = \\tilde{p} + \\lambda$ for some lattice vector $\\lambda$.\n\nSince $\\pi$ is a local isometry, its differential $d\\pi_x: T_x\\mathbb{R}^n \\to T_{\\pi(x)}T^n_\\Lambda$ is a linear isometry for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. We can lift the initial vector $v \\in T_p T^n_\\Lambda$ to a unique vector $\\tilde{v} \\in T_{\\tilde{p}}\\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v}) = v$.\n\nThe parallel transport map $P_{\\gamma}$ on the torus is related to the parallel transport map $\\tilde{P}_{\\tilde{\\gamma}}$ on the covering space by the following commutative diagram, which expresses that the projection of the lifted parallel transport is the parallel transport of the projected vector:\n$$\nP_{\\gamma} \\circ d\\pi_{\\tilde{\\gamma}(0)} = d\\pi_{\\tilde{\\gamma}(1)} \\circ \\tilde{P}_{\\tilde{\\gamma}}\n$$\nFrom this, we can write the holonomy operator as:\n$$\nP_{\\gamma} = d\\pi_{\\tilde{\\gamma}(1)} \\circ \\tilde{P}_{\\tilde{\\gamma}} \\circ (d\\pi_{\\tilde{\\gamma}(0)})^{-1}\n$$\nWe analyze each component of this composition.\nFirst, as established, parallel transport in Euclidean space is trivial. The map $\\tilde{P}_{\\tilde{\\gamma}}: T_{\\tilde{p}}\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to T_{\\tilde{p}+\\lambda}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ identifies a vector at $\\tilde{p}$ with the same vector (same components) at $\\tilde{p}+\\lambda$. Under the canonical trivialization of the tangent bundle $T\\mathbb{R}^n \\cong \\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\mathbb{R}^n$, this map is the identity on the vector part.\n\nSecond, we analyze the differentials of the covering map. The map $\\pi$ is defined by the quotient construction, so it is invariant under translations by lattice vectors: $\\pi(x + \\lambda) = \\pi(x)$ for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda$. Let $T_{\\lambda}(x) = x+\\lambda$ be the translation map on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Then we have $\\pi \\circ T_{\\lambda} = \\pi$. Taking the differential of this identity at a point $x$ gives:\n$$\nd\\pi_{T_{\\lambda}(x)} \\circ dT_{\\lambda, x} = d\\pi_{x}\n$$\nwhich is $d\\pi_{x+\\lambda} \\circ dT_{\\lambda, x} = d\\pi_{x}$. The differential of a translation, $dT_{\\lambda, x}$, is the identity map on tangent vectors. Therefore, we arrive at the crucial identity:\n$$\nd\\pi_{x+\\lambda} = d\\pi_{x}\n$$\nApplying this to our specific case with $x = \\tilde{p}$ and $\\tilde{\\gamma}(0)=\\tilde{p}$, $\\tilde{\\gamma}(1) = \\tilde{p}+\\lambda$, we get $d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}+\\lambda} = d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}}$.\nThis means $d\\pi_{\\tilde{\\gamma}(1)} = d\\pi_{\\tilde{\\gamma}(0)}$.\n\nSubstituting these findings into the expression for $P_\\gamma$:\n$$\nP_{\\gamma}(v) = (d\\pi_{\\tilde{\\gamma}(1)} \\circ \\tilde{P}_{\\tilde{\\gamma}} \\circ (d\\pi_{\\tilde{\\gamma}(0)})^{-1})(v)\n$$\nLet's trace the action on $v$:\n1. Lift $v$ to $\\tilde{v} = (d\\pi_{\\tilde{\\gamma}(0)})^{-1}(v) \\in T_{\\tilde{p}}\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n2. Parallel transport $\\tilde{v}$ along $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ to obtain $\\tilde{P}_{\\tilde{\\gamma}}(\\tilde{v}) \\in T_{\\tilde{p}+\\lambda}\\mathbb{R}^n$. As argued, this transported vector is simply $\\tilde{v}$ relocated to the new point.\n3. Project this vector back down to the torus: $d\\pi_{\\tilde{\\gamma}(1)}(\\tilde{P}_{\\tilde{\\gamma}}(\\tilde{v}))$.\nUsing our results:\n$$\nP_{\\gamma}(v) = d\\pi_{\\tilde{\\gamma}(1)}(\\tilde{P}_{\\tilde{\\gamma}}((d\\pi_{\\tilde{\\gamma}(0)})^{-1}(v))) = d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}+\\lambda}(\\tilde{P}_{\\tilde{\\gamma}}((d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}})^{-1}(v)))\n$$\nSince $\\tilde{P}_{\\tilde{\\gamma}}$ acts as the identity on the vector components and $d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}+\\lambda} = d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}}$, we have:\n$$\nP_{\\gamma}(v) = d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}}(\\text{Id}((d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}})^{-1}(v))) = d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}}((d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}})^{-1}(v)) = v\n$$\nThis shows that for any loop $\\gamma$ based at $p$, the parallel transport map $P_{\\gamma}$ is the identity transformation on $T_{p}T^{n}_{\\Lambda}$.\nTherefore, the holonomy group $\\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(T^{n}_{\\Lambda}, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}})$ consists of only one element, the identity element. Such a group is called the trivial group.\n\nThe order of a group is its cardinality.

The space is $\\mathbb{R}^{6}$ with coordinates $(x^{1}, \\dots, x^{6})$. The standard Euclidean metric $g$ is given by $g = \\sum_{j=1}^{6} (dx^{j})^{2}$. In the basis of coordinate vector fields $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}\\}_{j=1}^{6}$, the metric acts as $g(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{k}}) = \\delta_{jk}$, where $\\delta_{jk}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nThe complex structure $J$ is induced by the identification $z^{k} = x^{2k-1} + \\mathrm{i}\\,x^{2k}$, where $\\mathrm{i}^{2}=-1$. Multiplication by $\\mathrm{i}$ on $z^{k}$ yields $\\mathrm{i}z^{k} = \\mathrm{i}(x^{2k-1} + \\mathrm{i}\\,x^{2k}) = -x^{2k} + \\mathrm{i}\\,x^{2k-1}$. This corresponds to a linear transformation on the real coordinates $(x^{2k-1}, x^{2k}) \\mapsto (-x^{2k}, x^{2k-1})$. The action of $J$ on the basis vectors is therefore:\n$$\nJ\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k-1}}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k}}\n$$\n$$\nJ\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k}}\\right) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k-1}}\n$$\nfor $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nThe Kähler form $\\omega$ is a $2$-form defined by $\\omega(X,Y) = g(JX,Y)$. We compute its components $\\omega_{jk} = \\omega(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{k}})$.\nFor any fixed $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$:\n$$\n\\omega_{2k-1, 2k} = g\\left(J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k-1}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k}}\\right) = g\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k}}\\right) = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_{2k, 2k-1} = g\\left(J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k-1}}\\right) = g\\left(-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k-1}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2k-1}}\\right) = -1\n$$\nAll other components $\\omega_{jk}$ are zero.

The value of a simple $3$-form $e^i \\wedge e^j \\wedge e^k$ on $(v_1, v_2, v_3)$ is given by the determinant of a $3 \\times 3$ matrix:\n$$\n(e^i \\wedge e^j \\wedge e^k)(v_1, v_2, v_3) = \\det\n\\begin{pmatrix}\ne^i(v_1) & e^i(v_2) & e^i(v_3) \\\\\ne^j(v_1) & e^j(v_2) & e^j(v_3) \\\\\ne^k(v_1) & e^k(v_2) & e^k(v_3)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the values of the basis covectors $e^i$ on the vectors $v_j$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $e^{1}(v_1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, $e^{2}(v_1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, and $e^{i}(v_1) = 0$ for $i > 2$.\n    \\item $e^{4}(v_2) = 1$, and $e^{i}(v_2) = 0$ for $i \\ne 4$.\n    \\item $e^{5}(v_3) = 1$, and $e^{i}(v_3) = 0$ for $i \\ne 5$.\n\\end{itemize}\nNow, we evaluate each term of $\\varphi_0$:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $(e^{1}\\wedge e^{2}\\wedge e^{3})(v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0$.\n    \\item $(e^{1}\\wedge e^{4}\\wedge e^{5})(v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} e^1(v_1) & e^1(v_2) & e^1(v_3) \\\\ e^4(v_1) & e^4(v_2) & e^4(v_3) \\\\ e^5(v_1) & e^5(v_2) & e^5(v_3) \\end{pmatrix} = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n    \\item For $(e^{1}\\wedge e^{6}\\wedge e^{7})$, the rows corresponding to $e^6$ and $e^7$ are zero rows, so the determinant is $0$.\n    \\item For $(e^{2}\\wedge e^{4}\\wedge e^{6})$, the row corresponding to $e^6$ is a zero row, so the determinant is $0$.\n    \\item For $-(e^{2}\\wedge e^{5}\\wedge e^{7})$, the row corresponding to $e^7$ is a zero row, so the determinant is $0$.\n    \\item For $-(e^{3}\\wedge e^{4}\\wedge e^{7})$, the rows corresponding to $e^3$ and $e^7$ are zero rows, so the determinant is $0$.\n    \\item For $-(e^{3}\\wedge e^{5}\\wedge e^{6})$, the rows corresponding to $e^3$ and $e^6$ are zero rows, so the determinant is $0$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nSumming the contributions, we find the value:\n$$\n\\varphi_{0}(v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}) = 0 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + 0 + 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nThe calibration inequality for the oriented subspace $\\Xi$, with its given oriented orthonormal basis $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$, is:\n$$\n\\varphi_{0}(v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}) \\le 1\n$$\nwhere $1$ is the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the orthonormal vectors $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$, i.e., $\\text{vol}_{\\Xi}(v_1, v_2, v_3) = \\sqrt{\\det(g_0(v_i, v_j))} = \\sqrt{\\det(I_3)} = 1$.\nSubstituting our computed value, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\le 1\n$$\nThis inequality is true, as expected. However, since $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}  1$, equality does not hold for the subspace $\\Xi$.\n\nThe general condition for equality, $\\varphi_0(u_1, u_2, u_3) = 1$ for an oriented orthonormal basis $\\{u_1, u_2, u_3\\}$ of a $3$-dimensional subspace $\\Sigma \\subset \\mathbb{R}^7$, is that $\\Sigma$ must be an **associative $3$-plane**. Associative $3$-planes are a special class of subspaces in the geometry of $\\mathrm{G}_2$. They form a single orbit under the action of the group $\\mathrm{G}_2 \\subset SO(7)$, which is the stabilizer of $\\varphi_0$. A submanifold whose tangent planes are all associative is called an associative submanifold, and such submanifolds are volume-minimizing in their homology class due to being calibrated. The archetypal associative $3$-plane is $\\text{span}\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$, on which $\\varphi_0$ evaluates to $1$. Since $\\varphi_0(\\Xi) = 1/\\sqrt{2} \\ne 1$, $\\Xi$ is not an associative $3$-plane. It is also not a coassociative $3$-plane, for which the value would be $0$.\n\nThe numerical value of $\\varphi_0(v_1, v_2, v_3)$ is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}\n$$", "id": "3066220"}]}
