We begin with the general framework.\n\nLet $(M, g)$ be a Riemannian $n$-manifold. A Jacobi field $J$ along a geodesic $\\gamma$ is a vector field that arises from a variation of geodesics. If $\\gamma$ is parameterized by arc length $t$, the Jacobi equation is\n$$ \\nabla_{\\gamma'}\\nabla_{\\gamma'}J(t) + R(J(t), \\gamma'(t))\\gamma'(t) = 0 $$\nwhere $\\nabla_{\\gamma'}$ is the covariant derivative along $\\gamma$ and $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor.\nFor a manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$, the curvature tensor takes a specific form. For any orthonormal vectors $u, v$, we have $R(u,v)v = Ku$. A normal Jacobi field $J(t)$ is orthogonal to the geodesic's velocity vector $\\gamma'(t)$ for all $t$. Since $\\gamma$ is a unit-speed geodesic, we have $\\|\\gamma'(t)\\| = 1$. The term $R(J, \\gamma')\\gamma'$ simplifies to $KJ$. Thus, the Jacobi equation for a normal Jacobi field $J$ on a manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$ becomes the linear second-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$ J''(t) + K J(t) = 0 $$\nwhere $J''$ denotes $\\nabla_{\\gamma'}\\nabla_{\\gamma'}J$. To solve this vector-valued ODE, we can choose a parallel orthonormal frame $\\{E_1(t), E_2(t)\\}$ along $\\gamma(t)$ such that $E_1(t) = \\gamma'(t)$. Since the manifold is $2$-dimensional, any normal vector field must be proportional to $E_2(t)$. So we can write $J(t) = j(t)E_2(t)$ for some scalar function $j(t)$. As $E_2(t)$ is parallel transported, its covariant derivatives along $\\gamma$ are zero. The vector ODE then reduces to a scalar ODE for the function $j(t)$:\n$$ j''(t) + K j(t) = 0 $$\nThe initial conditions given are $J(0) = 0$ and $\\|J'(0)\\| = 1$. In terms of the scalar function $j(t)$, these become:\n$J(0) = j(0)E_2(0) = 0 \\implies j(0) = 0$.\n$J'(0) = j'(0)E_2(0)$, so $\\|J'(0)\\| = |j'(0)|\\|E_2(0)\\| = |j'(0)| = 1$. We can choose the orientation of $E_2(0)$ such that $j'(0) = 1$.\nSo, we must solve the scalar initial value problem $j''(t) + K j(t) = 0$ with $j(0) = 0$ and $j'(0) = 1$.\n\nFirst, we derive the Jacobi field in $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{2}, g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}\\right)$.\nThe Euclidean plane is a flat manifold, so its sectional curvature is $K = K_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}} = 0$. The Jacobi equation becomes:\n$$ j''(t) = 0 $$\nIntegrating twice gives the general solution $j(t) = c_1 t + c_2$. Applying the initial conditions:\n$j(0) = c_2 = 0$.\n$j'(t) = c_1$, so $j'(0) = c_1 = 1$.\nTherefore, the coefficient function is $j(t) = t$. The normal Jacobi field in the Euclidean plane is $J_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(t) = t E_2(t)$. The length of this field is $\\|J_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(t)\\| = |t| \\|E_2(t)\\| = t$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nNext, we derive the Jacobi field in $\\left(S^{2}_{r}, g_{r}\\right)$.\nThe round $2$-sphere of radius $r$ has constant positive sectional curvature $K = K_{S^{2}_{r}} = \\frac{1}{r^2}$. The Jacobi equation is:\n$$ j''(t) + \\frac{1}{r^2} j(t) = 0 $$\nThis is the equation of a simple harmonic oscillator. The general solution is $j(t) = c_1 \\cos\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right) + c_2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right)$. Applying the initial conditions:\n$j(0) = c_1 \\cos(0) + c_2 \\sin(0) = c_1 = 0$.\nThe solution simplifies to $j(t) = c_2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right)$. Differentiating with respect to $t$:\n$j'(t) = \\frac{c_2}{r} \\cos\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right)$.\nApplying the second initial condition: $j'(0) = \\frac{c_2}{r} \\cos(0) = \\frac{c_2}{r} = 1$, which yields $c_2 = r$.\nTherefore, the coefficient function is $j(t) = r \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right)$. The normal Jacobi field on the sphere is $J_{S^2_r}(t) = r \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right) E_2(t)$. The length of this field is $\\|J_{S^2_r}(t)\\| = \\left|r \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right)\\right|$.\n\nNow, we explain the appearance of conjugate points. A point $\\gamma(t_c)$ with $t_c  0$ is conjugate to $\\gamma(0)$ along the geodesic $\\gamma$ if there exists a nontrivial Jacobi field $J$ along $\\gamma$ such that $J(0) = 0$ and $J(t_c) = 0$.\nIn $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{2}, g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}\\right)$, the Jacobi field is $J_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(t) = t E_2(t)$. For this field to be zero, its magnitude must be zero, so $t=0$. For $t  0$, $J_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(t)$ is never zero. Thus, there are no conjugate points along any geodesic in the Euclidean plane. This corresponds to the geometric intuition that parallel lines never meet, and geodesics emanating from a point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ never reconverge.\n\nIn $\\left(S^{2}_{r}, g_{r}\\right)$, the Jacobi field is $J_{S^2_r}(t) = r \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right) E_2(t)$. It vanishes when $r \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right) = 0$. Since $r0$, this occurs when $\\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right) = 0$. This condition is met for $\\frac{t}{r} = k\\pi$ for any integer $k$. The first positive value $t_c$ for which this occurs corresponds to $k=1$, so $t_c = \\pi r$. The point $\\gamma(\\pi r)$ is the first conjugate point to $\\gamma(0)$. On a sphere, geodesics are great circles. All great circles starting at a point (e.g., the north pole) reconverge at its antipodal point, which is at a distance of $\\pi r$. The existence of this conjugate point is a direct consequence of the positive curvature of the sphere.\n\nThe Rauch comparison theorem provides a general explanation. It states that if we have two manifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$ with unit-speed geodesics $\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2$ and normal Jacobi fields $J_1, J_2$ satisfying $J_1(0)=J_2(0)=0$ and $\\|J_1'(0)\\|=\\|J_2'(0)\\|$, and if the sectional curvatures satisfy $K_1 \\le K_2$ along the geodesics, then the lengths of the Jacobi fields are related by $\\|J_1(t)\\| \\ge \\|J_2(t)\\|$.\nIn our case, let $M_1 = \\left(\\mathbb{R}^{2}, g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}\\right)$ and $M_2 = \\left(S^{2}_{r}, g_{r}\\right)$. The curvatures are $K_1 = 0$ and $K_2 = \\frac{1}{r^2}$. Since $r  0$, we have $K_1 \\le K_2$. The theorem implies $\\|J_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(t)\\| \\ge \\|J_{S^2_r}(t)\\|$. We found that $\\|J_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(t)\\| = t$ and $\\|J_{S^2_r}(t)\\| = r\\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right)$ (for $t \\in [0, \\pi r]$). The inequality becomes $t \\ge r\\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{r}\\right)$, which is a known result. The theorem formalizes the intuition that positive curvature has a focusing effect: it causes geodesics to converge more rapidly (or diverge more slowly) than in a space with less curvature. The length of the Jacobi field on the sphere is \"squeezed\" relative to the one in the plane, forcing it to become zero at $t_c = \\pi r$, while the linearly growing length of the Jacobi field in the plane never does.\n\nFinally, we compute the required product $K_{S^{2}_{r}}\\cdot (t_{c})^{2}$.\nWe have the sectional curvature $K_{S^{2}_{r}} = \\frac{1}{r^{2}}$ and the first conjugate time $t_{c} = \\pi r$.\nThe product is:\n$$ K_{S^{2}_{r}}\\cdot (t_{c})^{2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{r^{2}}\\right) \\cdot (\\pi r)^{2} = \\frac{1}{r^{2}} \\cdot \\pi^{2} r^{2} = \\pi^{2} $$\nThe result is a universal constant, independent of the radius $r$ of the sphere.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi^{2}}$$", "id": "3074549"}, {"introduction": "The true power of comparison theorems lies in their application to manifolds where curvature is not constant, which are far more common in modern geometry.

All conditions are met.\n\nThe problem asks to derive the scalar normal Jacobi equation and justify the formula for the radial sectional curvature, $K_r(t) = -f''(t)/f(t)$.\nA rotationally symmetric manifold with metric $g = dr^2 + f(r)^2 g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}$ is a warped product $M = I \\times_f \\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, where $I=(0,R)$ is an interval. The sectional curvature for a plane spanned by a vector $X$ tangent to the base $I$ and a vector $Y$ tangent to the fiber $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ is given by a standard formula. In our coordinate system, let $X = \\partial/\\partial r$. The formula is $K(X,Y) = -\\frac{1}{f(r)} g_I(\\nabla_X (\\text{grad}_I f), X)$.\nThe base manifold is the real line with metric $g_I=dr^2$. The gradient of the function $f(r)$ on the base is $\\text{grad}_I f = f'(r) (\\partial/\\partial r)$.\nWe compute the covariant derivative: $\\nabla_X (\\text{grad}_I f) = \\nabla_{\\partial/\\partial r} (f'(r) \\partial/\\partial r)$. Since the base is flat, the Christoffel symbols are zero, and the covariant derivative is just the partial derivative of the components, so $\\nabla_{\\partial/\\partial r} (\\partial/\\partial r) = 0$. Using the product rule, we get $\\nabla_{\\partial/\\partial r} (f'(r) \\partial/\\partial r) = (\\frac{d}{dr}f'(r)) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} = f''(r) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$.\nThen, $g_I(\\nabla_X (\\text{grad}_I f), X) = g_I(f''(r)\\partial/\\partial r, \\partial/\\partial r) = f''(r)g_I(\\partial/\\partial r, \\partial/\\partial r) = f''(r) \\cdot 1 = f''(r)$.\nSubstituting this into the curvature formula gives $K(X,Y) = -f''(r)/f(r)$.\nA radial geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ from the pole with unit speed is parameterized by arc length $t$, so $r(t)=t$. The tangent vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\partial/\\partial r$. A radial plane is any plane containing $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. The sectional curvature of such planes, denoted $K_r(t)$, is therefore $K_r(t)|_{r=t} = -f''(t)/f(t)$.\nThe Jacobi equation along a geodesic $\\gamma$ is $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J + R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$. For a normal Jacobi field $J(t)$ (i.e., $g(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))=0$), its length squared is $|J|^2=y^2$. The Jacobi equation for the scalar function $y(t) = |J(t)|$ simplifies to $y''(t) + K(\\sigma(t))y(t) = 0$, where $K(\\sigma(t))$ is the sectional curvature of the plane $\\sigma(t)$ spanned by $J(t)$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. In our case, this is the radial sectional curvature $K_r(t)$. Thus, the scalar normal Jacobi equation is $y''(t) + K_r(t)y(t)=0$.\n\nNext, we solve this ODE for the given warping function $f(r) = r - ar^3$ and initial conditions $y(0)=0, y'(0)=1$.\nFor a rotationally symmetric manifold, a normal Jacobi field vanishing at the pole $t=0$ has scalar part $y(t)$ given by $y(t) = f(t)$. Let's verify this. We need to check if $y(t)=f(t)$ satisfies the ODE and the initial conditions.\nThe ODE is $y'' + K_r(t)y = 0$, which is $y'' - \\frac{f''(t)}{f(t)} y = 0$.\nIf we substitute $y(t)=f(t)$, we get $f''(t) - \\frac{f''(t)}{f(t)}f(t) = f''(t) - f''(t) = 0$. So $y(t)=f(t)$ is a solution.\nNow we check the initial conditions.\nFrom the problem statement $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=1$.\nSo, $y(0) = f(0) = 0$, and $y'(0) = f'(0) = 1$. Both initial conditions are satisfied.\nTherefore, the solution to the Jacobi equation with the specified initial conditions is simply the warping function evaluated at $r=t$.\nFor $f(r) = r(1-ar^2)$, the solution is $y(t) = f(t) = t(1-at^2) = t - at^3$.\n\nThe conjugate radius $t_c$ is the first positive time $t0$ where the Jacobi field vanishes, i.e., $y(t_c)=0$.\nWe solve $y(t) = t(1-at^2) = 0$.\nThe solutions are $t=0$ and $1-at^2=0$.\n$1-at^2=0$ implies $t^2 = 1/a$. Since $t$ must be positive, we take the positive root.\nThe first positive zero is $t_c = 1/\\sqrt{a}$.\n\nFinally, we apply the Rauch comparison theorem.\nFirst, we compute the radial sectional curvature $K_r(t)$ for our manifold.\n$f(t) = t - at^3$.\n$f'(t) = 1 - 3at^2$.\n$f''(t) = -6at$.\n$K_r(t) = -\\frac{f''(t)}{f(t)} = -\\frac{-6at}{t - at^3} = \\frac{6at}{t(1-at^2)} = \\frac{6a}{1-at^2}$.\nWe are to compare this to a model space $(\\tilde{M}, \\tilde{g})$ of constant sectional curvature $\\kappa = 6a$.\nFor $t \\in (0, t_c) = (0, 1/\\sqrt{a})$, we have $0  t  1/\\sqrt{a}$, which implies $0  t^2  1/a$, so $0  at^2  1$.\nThis gives $0  1 - at^2  1$.\nTherefore, $\\frac{1}{1-at^2}  1$.\nSince $a0$, we have $K_r(t) = 6a \\left(\\frac{1}{1-at^2}\\right)  6a = \\kappa$.\nSo, the sectional curvature of our manifold $M$ is strictly greater than the curvature of the comparison space $\\tilde{M}$ for all $t \\in (0, t_c)$.\n\nThe Rauch comparison theorem states that if $K_M \\ge K_{\\tilde{M}}$, then the first conjugate point in $M$ occurs no later than the first conjugate point in $\\tilde{M}$. That is, $t_c \\le \\tilde{t}_c$.\nLet's find the conjugate radius $\\tilde{t}_c$ for the constant curvature space. The scalar Jacobi equation is $\\tilde{y}''(t) + \\kappa \\tilde{y}(t) = 0$, which is $\\tilde{y}''(t) + 6a \\tilde{y}(t) = 0$.\nThe general solution is $\\tilde{y}(t) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{6a}t) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{6a}t)$.\nThe initial conditions are $\\tilde{y}(0)=0$ and $\\tilde{y}'(0)=1$.\n$\\tilde{y}(0) = A = 0$.\n$\\tilde{y}'(t) = B\\sqrt{6a}\\cos(\\sqrt{6a}t)$.\n$\\tilde{y}'(0) = B\\sqrt{6a} = 1 \\implies B = 1/\\sqrt{6a}$.\nSo, $\\tilde{y}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6a}}\\sin(\\sqrt{6a}t)$.\nThe first positive conjugate point $\\tilde{t}_c$ occurs at the first positive zero of $\\tilde{y}(t)$. We must have $\\sin(\\sqrt{6a}\\tilde{t}_c) = 0$, which means $\\sqrt{6a}\\tilde{t}_c = \\pi$.\nThis gives $\\tilde{t}_c = \\pi/\\sqrt{6a}$.\n\nThe Rauch theorem predicts $t_c \\le \\tilde{t}_c$, which is $1/\\sqrt{a} \\le \\pi/\\sqrt{6a}$.\nThis inequality simplifies to $1 \\le \\pi/\\sqrt{6}$, or $\\sqrt{6} \\le \\pi$.\nSquaring both sides gives $6 \\le \\pi^2$. Since $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.8696$, so the inequality $6 \\le \\pi^2$ is true. This confirms the theorem's application.\nThe physical interpretation of this inequality is that a region of higher curvature focuses geodesics more strongly. Since $K_r(t)  \\kappa$, our manifold is more curved along the geodesic path than the comparison space. This stronger focusing causes geodesics emanating from the pole to reconverge faster, leading to a smaller conjugate radius ($t_c  \\tilde{t}_c$).\n\nThe problem asks for the single analytic expression of the conjugate radius $t_c$ as a function of $a$. This was found to be $t_c = 1/\\sqrt{a}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}}$$", "id": "3036482"}]}
