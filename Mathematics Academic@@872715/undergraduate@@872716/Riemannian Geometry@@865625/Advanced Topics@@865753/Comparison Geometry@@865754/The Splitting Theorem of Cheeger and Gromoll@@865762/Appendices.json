The Cheeger–Gromoll splitting theorem asserts that on a complete Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature, the existence of a line implies an isometric splitting with a Euclidean factor $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nConsider the case where $(M,g)$ is compact. Use only fundamental properties of a compact metric space (continuity of the distance function and attainment of maxima on compact sets) together with the triangle inequality to reason about whether $(M,g)$ can contain a line. Select the option that correctly and rigorously justifies the conclusion.\n\nA. Because $M$ is compact, the diameter\n$$\n\\operatorname{diam}(M):=\\max\\{d(x,y):x,y\\in M\\}\n$$\nis finite. If a line $\\gamma$ existed, then $d(\\gamma(s),\\gamma(t))=|s-t|$ could be made arbitrarily large by choosing $|s-t|$ large, contradicting the finiteness of $\\operatorname{diam}(M)$.

Since the image of a line would be homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$, which is noncompact, this is impossible. Therefore $M$ cannot contain a line.\n\nC. In any compact manifold, the triangle inequality forces strict inequality $d(\\gamma(s),\\gamma(t))|s-t|$ for all distinct $s\\neq t$, so no geodesic can satisfy the global minimizing property. Hence compact manifolds cannot contain lines.\n\nD. In a compact manifold, all geodesics are periodic.

A fundamental property of a compact metric space is that it is bounded, meaning its diameter is finite. The diameter is defined as $\\operatorname{diam}(M) = \\sup_{x,y \\in M} d(x,y)$. Because the distance function $d: M \\times M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous and the product space $M \\times M$ is compact, the Extreme Value Theorem guarantees that $d$ attains its maximum value. Thus, there exist points $p, q \\in M$ such that $d(p,q) = \\operatorname{diam}(M)$, and this value is finite.\n\nNow, we evaluate the possibility of $(M,g)$ containing a line by contradiction. Assume that there exists a line $\\gamma: \\mathbb{R} \\to M$. By definition, a line is a globally minimizing geodesic, meaning for any two real numbers $s, t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the distance between the corresponding points on the manifold is $d\\big(\\gamma(s), \\gamma(t)\\big) = |s-t|$.\n\nThe points $\\gamma(s)$ and $\\gamma(t)$ are elements of the manifold $M$. By the definition of the diameter, the distance between any two points in $M$ cannot exceed $\\operatorname{diam}(M)$. Therefore, it must be that for all $s,t\\in\\mathbb{R}$:\n$$\nd\\big(\\gamma(s), \\gamma(t)\\big) \\le \\operatorname{diam}(M)\n$$\nCombining these two statements, we must have $|s-t| \\le \\operatorname{diam}(M)$ for all $s,t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nHowever, this is a contradiction. The set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ is unbounded. We can choose $s$ and $t$ such that the absolute difference $|s-t|$ is larger than any pre-assigned finite positive number. For instance, we can choose $s=0$ and $t = \\operatorname{diam}(M) + 1$. For this choice, we would have $|s-t| = \\operatorname{diam}(M) + 1$. This leads to the contradictory inequality:\n$$\n\\operatorname{diam}(M) + 1 \\le \\operatorname{diam}(M)\n$$\nwhich is false. The source of the contradiction is our initial assumption that a line $\\gamma$ exists in $M$. Therefore, a compact Riemannian manifold cannot contain a line.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\n**A.** This option precisely follows the logical argument derived above. It correctly identifies that compactness implies a finite diameter and that the definition of a line implies the existence of pairs of points with arbitrarily large distances, creating a direct and sound contradiction.\n\n**B.** This option presents a topological argument. Its premise \"the image $\\gamma(\\mathbb{R})$ of any geodesic is compact\" is false; a dense geodesic on a flat torus is a counterexample. While a more nuanced version of this topological argument is valid (the image of a *line* must be a closed subset, hence compact, which contradicts it being homeomorphic to non-compact $\\mathbb{R}$), the premise as stated is flawed.\n\n**C.** This statement is fundamentally incorrect. A geodesic is *locally* length-minimizing, meaning for sufficiently close points, $d(\\gamma(s), \\gamma(t)) = |s-t|$. The claim that the inequality is always strict for distinct points is false.\n\n**D.** The premise \"In a compact manifold, all geodesics are periodic\" is false.

Busemann Function:**\nThe first step is to compute the forward Busemann function $b^{+}(x) = \\lim_{s\\to\\infty}\\big(d(x,\\ell(s)) - s\\big)$, where $x=(t,\\theta) \\in M$. The manifold is a flat cylinder. The squared distance $d(x,y)^2$ between $x=(t,\\theta)$ and $y=(t',\\theta')$ is given by $(t-t')^2 + (R \\cdot d_{S^1}(\\theta, \\theta'))^2$, where $d_{S^1}(\\theta, \\theta')$ is the shortest angular distance on the circle.

The Busemann function is then:\n$$\nb^{+}(t,\\theta) = \\lim_{s\\to\\infty} \\left( \\sqrt{(s-t)^2 + A^2} - s \\right)\n$$\nMultiplying and dividing by the conjugate, we obtain:\n$$\nb^{+}(t,\\theta) = \\lim_{s\\to\\infty} \\frac{(s-t)^2 + A^2 - s^2}{\\sqrt{(s-t)^2 + A^2} + s} = \\lim_{s\\to\\infty} \\frac{s^2 - 2st + t^2 + A^2 - s^2}{s\\sqrt{(1-t/s)^2 + A^2/s^2} + s}\n$$\n$$\nb^{+}(t,\\theta) = \\lim_{s\\to\\infty} \\frac{-2st + t^2 + A^2}{s\\left(\\sqrt{1 - 2t/s + (t^2+A^2)/s^2} + 1\\right)} = \\frac{-2t}{1+1} = -t.\n$$\nThus, the Busemann function is $b^{+}(t,\\theta) = -t$.\n\n**2. Gradient and Level Set:**\nThe second step is to compute the gradient $\\nabla b^{+}$. The differential is $\\mathrm{d}b^{+} = - \\mathrm{d}t$. The inverse metric tensor in $(t, \\theta)$ coordinates is $g^{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  R^{-2} \\end{pmatrix}$.

The flow lines of the parallel vector field $\\nabla b^{+}$ are geodesics orthogonal to the level sets of $b^{+}$, generating the splitting.\n\n**3. Explicit Splitting Map:**\nThe third step is to construct the splitting map $\\Phi: \\mathbb{R} \\times N \\to M$. This map is defined by the flow of $\\nabla b^{+}$. The integral curve $\\gamma(s) = (t(s), \\Theta(s))$ starting at a point $p=(t_0, \\theta_0) \\in N$ is given by $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\gamma}{\\mathrm{d}s} = \\nabla b^{+} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$.

The metric on $M$ is $g = \\mathrm{d}t^{2} + R^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Theta^{2}$.
