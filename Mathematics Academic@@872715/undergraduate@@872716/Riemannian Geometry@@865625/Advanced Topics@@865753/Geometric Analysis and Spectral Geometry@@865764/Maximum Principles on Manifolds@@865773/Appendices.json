Since the annulus $A$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ equipped with the standard Euclidean metric, the induced Riemannian metric on $A$ is flat. In this case, the Laplace-Beltrami operator is identical to the standard Euclidean Laplacian, which in Cartesian coordinates $(x_1, x_2)$ is $\\Delta = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_1^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_2^2}$.\n\nGiven the rotational symmetry of the domain $A$, it is natural to seek a solution that depends only on the radial coordinate $r = |x| = \\sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2}$. Let's express the function as $u(x) = f(r)$. We must express the Laplacian in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$. The Laplacian of a function $v(r, \\theta)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta v = \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial \\theta^2}\n$$\nFor a radially symmetric function $u(x) = f(r)$, the derivatives with respect to $\\theta$ are zero. Therefore, the harmonic condition $\\Delta u = 0$ simplifies to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $f(r)$:\n$$\nf''(r) + \\frac{1}{r}f'(r) = 0\n$$\nThis equation is defined for $r \\in (1, \\exp(2))$. Let $g(r) = f'(r)$. The ODE becomes a first-order separable equation for $g(r)$:\n$$\ng'(r) = -\\frac{1}{r} g(r) \\implies \\frac{dg}{g} = -\\frac{dr}{r}\n$$\nIntegrating both sides yields:\n$$\n\\ln|g(r)| = -\\ln(r) + C_1 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right) + C_1\n$$\nwhere we use $\\ln(r)$ instead of $\\ln|r|$ since $r  0$. Exponentiating gives $|g(r)| = \\frac{\\exp(C_1)}{r}$. We can write this as $g(r) = \\frac{C_2}{r}$ for some constant $C_2$.\nNow, we substitute back $f'(r) = g(r)$:\n$$\nf'(r) = \\frac{C_2}{r}\n$$\nIntegrating with respect to $r$ gives the general form for $f(r)$:\n$$\nf(r) = C_2 \\ln(r) + C_3\n$$\nwhere $C_2$ and $C_3$ are arbitrary constants.\nThe problem requires an explicit nonconstant function. To ensure the function is nonconstant, we must choose $C_2 \\neq 0$. For maximal simplicity, we choose $C_2 = 1$ and $C_3 = 0$. This gives us the explicit harmonic function:\n$$\nu(x) = \\ln(|x|)\n$$\nThis function is smooth and nonconstant on $A$.\n\nNext, we must verify that the maximum value of $u$ on the closure $\\overline{A} = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : 1 \\le |x| \\le \\exp(2) \\}$ occurs on the boundary $\\partial A = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : |x| = 1 \\} \\cup \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : |x| = \\exp(2) \\}$.\nThis is a direct consequence of the Maximum Principle for harmonic functions. The principle states that a nonconstant function that is harmonic on a connected open domain $D$ and continuous on its closure $\\overline{D}$ (which must be compact) attains its maximum and minimum values exclusively on the boundary $\\partial D$.\nIn our case, $D = A$ is a connected open domain, and its closure $\\overline{A}$ is compact. Our function $u(x) = \\ln(|x|)$ is harmonic on $A$ and clearly continuous on $\\overline{A}$. Since $u$ is nonconstant, the Maximum Principle guarantees that its maximum must be attained on $\\partial A$.\n\nWe can also verify this directly for our chosen function. To find local extrema in the interior of $A$, we would look for points where the gradient of $u$ is zero. The gradient of $u(x) = \\ln(|x|) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(x_1^2+x_2^2)$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla u = \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_1}, \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{x_1}{x_1^2+x_2^2}, \\frac{x_2}{x_1^2+x_2^2} \\right) = \\frac{x}{|x|^2}\n$$\nThe gradient $\\nabla u$ is the zero vector only if $x = (0,0)$, which is not in the domain $A$. Thus, there are no critical points in the interior of $A$. By the Extreme Value Theorem, the continuous function $u$ must attain a maximum on the compact set $\\overline{A}$. Since there are no interior critical points, this maximum must occur on the boundary $\\partial A$.\n\nFinally, we compute the maximum value of $u$ on $\\overline{A}$ by evaluating $u$ on the boundary components.\nThe boundary $\\partial A$ consists of two circles:\n1.  The inner boundary, where $|x| = 1$. On this circle, the value of the function is $u(x) = \\ln(|x|) = \\ln(1) = 0$.\n2.  The outer boundary, where $|x| = \\exp(2)$. On this circle, the value of the function is $u(x) = \\ln(|x|) = \\ln(\\exp(2)) = 2$.\n\nComparing the values on the boundary components, the minimum value is $0$ and the maximum value is $2$.\nTherefore, the maximum value of $u(x) = \\ln(|x|)$ on the closure of the annulus $\\overline{A}$ is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3057819"}, {"introduction": "Mathematical theorems are built on precise hypotheses, and understanding why each condition is necessary is as important as knowing the theorem itself.

According to the Heine-Borel theorem for Euclidean spaces $\\mathbb{R}^n$, a set is compact if and only if it is both closed and bounded.

Since for any arbitrarily large radius $R$, we can find points in $\\overline{\\Omega}$ that are not in $B_R(0)$, the set $\\overline{\\Omega}$ is unbounded.
