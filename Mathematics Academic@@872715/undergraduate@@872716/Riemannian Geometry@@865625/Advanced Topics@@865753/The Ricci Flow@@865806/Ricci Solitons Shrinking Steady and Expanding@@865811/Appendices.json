We will proceed by following the steps outlined in the problem statement.\n\nThe manifold is $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with global Cartesian coordinates $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$. The metric tensor is the standard Euclidean metric $g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}$, whose components are given by the Kronecker delta, $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$. The inverse metric has components $g^{ij} = \\delta^{ij}$. The function under consideration is $f(x) = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} |x|^2 = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^n (x^k)^2$, where $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a constant.\n\nFirst, we compute the gradient vector field $\\nabla f$. By definition, the gradient is the vector field metrically dual to the differential $1$-form $df$. The components of $df$ are given by the partial derivatives of $f$:\n$$\n(df)_i = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^n (x^k)^2 \\right) = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} (x^k)^2 = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^n 2x^k \\delta_i^k = \\lambda x^i.\n$$\nThe components of the gradient vector field, $(\\nabla f)^j$, are obtained by raising the index of $(df)_i$ with the inverse metric $g^{ij}$:\n$$\n(\\nabla f)^j = g^{ji} (df)_i = \\delta^{ji} (\\lambda x^i) = \\lambda x^j.\n$$\nThus, the gradient vector field in these coordinates is $\\nabla f = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\lambda x^j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}$.\n\nNext, we compute the Hessian of $f$, which is the $(0,2)$-tensor $\\nabla^2 f$ given by the covariant derivative of the $1$-form $df$. Its components are $(\\nabla^2 f)_{ij} = \\nabla_i (df)_j$. The formula for the covariant derivative of a covector field is:\n$$\n(\\nabla^2 f)_{ij} = \\nabla_i (df)_j = \\frac{\\partial (df)_j}{\\partial x^i} - \\Gamma_{ij}^k (df)_k,\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma_{ij}^k$ are the Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection. For the Euclidean metric $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ in Cartesian coordinates, all metric components are constant. The Christoffel symbols are calculated as:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{ij}^k = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{li}}{\\partial x^j} + \\frac{\\partial g_{lj}}{\\partial x^i} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l} \\right).\n$$\nSince all derivatives of the constant metric components are zero, all Christoffel symbols are zero: $\\Gamma_{ij}^k = 0$.\nThe expression for the Hessian components simplifies to:\n$$\n(\\nabla^2 f)_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial (df)_j}{\\partial x^i} = \\frac{\\partial (\\lambda x^j)}{\\partial x^i} = \\lambda \\frac{\\partial x^j}{\\partial x^i} = \\lambda \\delta_i^j.\n$$\nAs we are working in an orthonormal coordinate system, we can write $\\delta_i^j$ as $\\delta_{ij}$. The components of the Euclidean metric are $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$. Therefore, we can express the Hessian components as:\n$$\n(\\nabla^2 f)_{ij} = \\lambda \\delta_{ij} = \\lambda g_{ij}.\n$$\nThis means that the Hessian tensor is a scalar multiple of the metric tensor: $\\nabla^2 f = \\lambda g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}$.\n\nNow, we verify the Ricci soliton equation: $\\operatorname{Ric} + \\nabla^2 f = \\lambda g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}$.\nFrom our previous calculation, we have $\\nabla^2 f = \\lambda g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric} + \\lambda g_{\\mathrm{eucl}} = \\lambda g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}.\n$$\nThis equation holds true if and only if the Ricci tensor is identically zero, $\\operatorname{Ric} = 0$. We must verify this for Euclidean space. The components of the Ricci tensor, $R_{ik}$, are the contraction of the Riemann curvature tensor, $R_{ik} = R^j_{ijk}$. The components of the Riemann tensor are given by:\n$$\nR^l_{ijk} = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma_{jk}^l}{\\partial x^i} - \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma_{ik}^l}{\\partial x^j} + \\sum_{m=1}^n \\left( \\Gamma_{im}^l \\Gamma_{jk}^m - \\Gamma_{jm}^l \\Gamma_{ik}^m \\right).\n$$\nAs established, for the Euclidean metric in Cartesian coordinates, all Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma_{jk}^l$ are zero. Consequently, their partial derivatives are also zero. This implies that all components of the Riemann curvature tensor are zero, $R^l_{ijk} = 0$. Therefore, the Ricci tensor is also zero, $R_{ik} = 0$, and so $\\operatorname{Ric}=0$. The Ricci soliton equation is thus verified for all $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the Laplace-Beltrami operator of $f$, $\\Delta f$, defined as the trace of the Hessian with respect to the metric: $\\Delta f = g^{ij}(\\nabla^2 f)_{ij}$.\nUsing our result for the components of the Hessian, $(\\nabla^2 f)_{ij} = \\lambda g_{ij}$, we substitute this into the definition of the Laplacian:\n$$\n\\Delta f = g^{ij} (\\lambda g_{ij}) = \\lambda g^{ij}g_{ij}.\n$$\nTo evaluate $g^{ij}g_{ij}$, we can raise an index on $g_{ij}$ to form the Kronecker delta. The quantity $g^{ij}g_{ij}$ is the trace of the identity matrix. Let us show this formally. The Laplacian is the trace of the $(1,1)$-tensor obtained by raising one of the indices of the Hessian. Let's call this tensor $H$, with components $H^i_j = g^{ik}(\\nabla^2 f)_{kj}$.\n$$\nH^i_j = g^{ik}(\\lambda g_{kj}) = \\lambda (g^{ik}g_{kj}) = \\lambda \\delta^i_j.\n$$\nThe Laplacian is the trace of this tensor:\n$$\n\\Delta f = \\operatorname{tr}(H) = \\sum_{i=1}^n H^i_i = \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\lambda \\delta^i_i).\n$$\nThe term $\\delta^i_i$ is $1$ for each value of $i$ in the sum.

To perform this calculation, we first re-index the formula for the Riemann tensor.
