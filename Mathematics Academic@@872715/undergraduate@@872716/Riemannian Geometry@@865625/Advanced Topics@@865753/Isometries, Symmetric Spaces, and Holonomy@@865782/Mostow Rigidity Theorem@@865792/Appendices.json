For a fixed closed manifold $M$ of dimension $n \\ge 3$, one can generally construct a continuous family of non-isometric metrics that all have sectional curvature strictly between two negative constants. Taking any two such distinct metrics, $g$ and $h$, on $M$ provides a counterexample to rigidity: the identity isomorphism on $\\pi_1(M)$ is not induced by an isometry between $(M,g)$ and $(M,h)$ because they are not isometric.

The kernel would be the centralizer $C_G(\\Gamma)$, which is trivial for a (non-elementary) lattice in $\\mathrm{Isom}(\\mathbb{H}^n)$, ensuring injectivity. The surjectivity is the content of the algebraic version of the theorem.\nSo, we have $N_G(\\Gamma) \\cong \\mathrm{Aut}(\\Gamma)$.\n\nNow we combine our two results.

Letting $\\Gamma = \\rho(\\pi_1(M))$, the formula is $\\mathrm{Isom}(M) \\cong N_{\\mathrm{Isom}(\\mathbb{H}^n)}(\\Gamma) / \\Gamma$. The Mostow rigidity theorem guarantees that any two such representations $\\rho_1, \\rho_2$ are conjugate, i.e., $\\rho_2(\\cdot) = g \\rho_1(\\cdot) g^{-1}$ for some $g \\in \\mathrm{Isom}(\\mathbb{H}^n)$. This implies that the resulting quotient group $N(\\Gamma)/\\Gamma$ is well-defined up to isomorphism, regardless of the choice of representation. The procedure is sound.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nD.

The deck transformation group is $\\pi_1(M)$, which for a hyperbolic manifold is an infinite, non-abelian group. The isometry group of a closed (compact) manifold, $\\mathrm{Isom}(M)$, is always a compact Lie group. For a Riemannian manifold, it is a known result (Myers-Steenrod) that $\\mathrm{Isom}(M)$ is a Lie group. For a closed hyperbolic manifold, it is a finite group. An infinite group cannot be isomorphic to a finite group. This option confuses the isometries of the manifold $M$ with the deck isometries of its cover $\\mathbb{H}^n$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nE.

There exist many non-isometric hyperbolic $n$-manifolds ($n \\ge 3$) that are not homeomorphic (and thus have non-isomorphic fundamental groups) but have isomorphic homology groups.
