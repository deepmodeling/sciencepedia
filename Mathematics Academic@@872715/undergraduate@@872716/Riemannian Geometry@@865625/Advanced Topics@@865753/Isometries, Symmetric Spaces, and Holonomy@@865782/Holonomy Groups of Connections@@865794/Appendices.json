We will follow the structured tasks provided in the problem statement.\n\nTask 1: Christoffel symbols and parallel transport in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nLet $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be endowed with the standard Euclidean metric $g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}$. In standard Cartesian coordinates $\\{x^{1}, x^{2}, \\dots, x^{n}\\}$, the components of the metric tensor are given by the Kronecker delta, $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$. These components are constant throughout $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The inverse metric tensor has components $g^{ij} = \\delta^{ij}$.\n\nThe Levi-Civita connection is characterized by its Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^{k}_{\\; ij}$, which are calculated using the formula:\n$$\n\\Gamma^{k}_{\\; ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{k\\ell}\\left( \\partial_{i} g_{j\\ell} + \\partial_{j} g_{i\\ell} - \\partial_{\\ell} g_{ij} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\partial_{i}$ denotes the partial derivative with respect to the coordinate $x^{i}$. Since the components $g_{j\\ell}$, $g_{i\\ell}$, and $g_{ij}$ are all constant ($\\delta_{j\\ell}$, $\\delta_{i\\ell}$, and $\\delta_{ij}$ respectively), their partial derivatives with respect to any coordinate $x^{i}$ are zero.\n$$\n\\partial_{i} g_{j\\ell} = \\partial_{i} \\delta_{j\\ell} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this into the formula for the Christoffel symbols yields:\n$$\n\\Gamma^{k}_{\\; ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{k\\ell}\\left( 0 + 0 - 0 \\right) = 0\n$$\nThus, all Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection for the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are zero in standard Cartesian coordinates.\n\nNow, consider a vector field $V(t)$ along an arbitrary smooth curve $\\widetilde{\\gamma}(t)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The condition for $V(t)$ to be parallel transported along $\\widetilde{\\gamma}(t)$ is that its covariant derivative along the curve vanishes:\n$$\n\\frac{D V^{k}}{dt} = \\frac{d V^{k}}{dt} + \\Gamma^{k}_{\\; ij}(\\widetilde{\\gamma}(t)) \\, \\frac{d \\widetilde{\\gamma}^{i}}{dt} \\, V^{j}(t) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\Gamma^{k}_{\\; ij} = 0$ everywhere, this equation simplifies dramatically to:\n$$\n\\frac{d V^{k}}{dt} = 0\n$$\nThis is the parallel transport equation for a vector field along a curve in $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}})$.\n\nTask 2: Parallel transport map in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nThe result from Task 1, $\\frac{d V^{k}}{dt} = 0$, implies that for a parallel vector field $V(t)$ along a curve $\\widetilde{\\gamma}(t)$, its components $V^{k}(t)$ in the standard Cartesian basis $\\{ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{1}}, \\dots, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{n}} \\}$ are constant for all $t \\in [0,1]$.\nIntegrating this equation from $t=0$ to an arbitrary $t$ gives:\n$$\nV^{k}(t) = V^{k}(0)\n$$\nLet $P_{\\widetilde{\\gamma}}: T_{\\widetilde{\\gamma}(0)}\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to T_{\\widetilde{\\gamma}(1)}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be the parallel transport map along the curve $\\widetilde{\\gamma}$. A vector $V_0 = V(0) \\in T_{\\widetilde{\\gamma}(0)}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is mapped to $V_1 = V(1) \\in T_{\\widetilde{\\gamma}(1)}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. In the standard basis, if $V_0$ has components $(V^{1}(0), \\dots, V^{n}(0))$, then the transported vector $V_1$ has components $(V^{1}(1), \\dots, V^{n}(1))$.\nFrom our result, $V^{k}(1) = V^{k}(0)$ for all $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThe standard basis for the tangent space $T_x \\mathbb{R}^n$ at any point $x$ can be identified with a single basis for the vector space $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Under this canonical identification, the vector $V_1$ is identical to the vector $V_0$. Therefore, the parallel transport map $P_{\\widetilde{\\gamma}}$ is the identity map. If represented as a matrix in the standard basis, it is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix $I_{n}$.\n\nTask 3: Parallel transport on the torus $T^{n}$.\n\nThe $n$-torus $T^{n}$ is defined as the quotient manifold $T^{n} = \\mathbb{R}^{n} / \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$. The map $\\pi : \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to T^{n}$ given by $\\pi(x) = x \\bmod \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ is a covering map. Since the metric $g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}$ on $T^n$ is induced from the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, $\\pi$ is a local isometry. This implies that $\\pi$ preserves the Levi-Civita connection.\n\nLet $\\gamma : [0,1] \\to T^{n}$ be a piecewise smooth loop based at $p \\in T^n$, so $\\gamma(0) = \\gamma(1) = p$. Let $v \\in T_{p}T^{n}$ be a tangent vector. The parallel transport map $P_{\\gamma}$ maps $v$ to $P_{\\gamma}(v) \\in T_{p}T^{n}$. To compute this, we lift the problem to the covering space $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nChoose a point $\\tilde{p}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\\pi(\\tilde{p}_0) = p$. By the path lifting property of covering spaces, there exists a unique path $\\widetilde{\\gamma} : [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ starting at $\\tilde{p}_0$ such that $\\pi \\circ \\widetilde{\\gamma} = \\gamma$. Since $\\gamma$ is a loop, its endpoint $\\widetilde{\\gamma}(1)$ must also lie in the fiber over $p$, i.e., $\\pi(\\widetilde{\\gamma}(1)) = p$. This means there exists an integer vector $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ such that $\\widetilde{\\gamma}(1) = \\tilde{p}_0 + m$. Let $\\tilde{p}_1 = \\widetilde{\\gamma}(1)$. The map $T_m : \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ defined by $T_m(x) = x+m$ is a deck transformation of the covering.\n\nThe computation of $P_{\\gamma}(v)$ proceeds in three steps:\n1. Lift the vector $v \\in T_p T^n$ to a vector $\\tilde{v}_0 \\in T_{\\tilde{p}_0} \\mathbb{R}^n$. The differential $d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_0} : T_{\\tilde{p}_0} \\mathbb{R}^n \\to T_p T^n$ is an isomorphism, so there is a unique $\\tilde{v}_0$ such that $d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_0}(\\tilde{v}_0) = v$.\n2. Parallel transport $\\tilde{v}_0$ along the lifted path $\\widetilde{\\gamma}$ to obtain a vector $\\tilde{v}_1 = P_{\\widetilde{\\gamma}}(\\tilde{v}_0) \\in T_{\\tilde{p}_1} \\mathbb{R}^n$. As established in Task 2, under the standard identification of tangent spaces in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, this map is the identity: the components of $\\tilde{v}_1$ in the standard basis at $\\tilde{p}_1$ are identical to the components of $\\tilde{v}_0$ in the standard basis at $\\tilde{p}_0$.\n3. Project the resulting vector $\\tilde{v}_1$ back down to $T_p T^n$. The transported vector is $P_{\\gamma}(v) = d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_1}(\\tilde{v}_1)$.\n\nTo express $P_{\\gamma}$ as a linear map on $T_p T^n$, we need to relate the final vector $P_{\\gamma}(v)$ to the initial vector $v$. We have $v = d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_0}(\\tilde{v}_0)$. Thus, we need to compare $d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_1}(\\tilde{v}_1)$ with $d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_0}(\\tilde{v}_0)$.\n\nWe use the property that $\\pi$ commutes with deck transformations: $\\pi \\circ T_{-m} = \\pi$. Differentiating this identity at the point $\\tilde{p}_1$ gives:\n$d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_1-m} \\circ dT_{-m, \\tilde{p}_1} = d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_1}$.\nSince $\\tilde{p}_1 - m = \\tilde{p}_0$, this becomes $d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_0} \\circ dT_{-m, \\tilde{p}_1} = d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_1}$.\nSubstituting this into our expression for $P_{\\gamma}(v)$:\n$P_{\\gamma}(v) = d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_1}(\\tilde{v}_1) = (d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_0} \\circ dT_{-m, \\tilde{p}_1})(\\tilde{v}_1) = d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_0}(dT_{-m, \\tilde{p}_1}(\\tilde{v}_1))$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the vector $dT_{-m, \\tilde{p}_1}(\\tilde{v}_1) \\in T_{\\tilde{p}_0}\\mathbb{R}^n$.\nThe map $T_{-m}$ is a translation, so its differential $dT_{-m, \\tilde{p}_1}$ maps a vector from $T_{\\tilde{p}_1}\\mathbb{R}^n$ to $T_{\\tilde{p}_0}\\mathbb{R}^n$ by preserving its components in the standard basis.\nFrom step 2, the vector $\\tilde{v}_1 \\in T_{\\tilde{p}_1}\\mathbb{R}^n$ has the same components as $\\tilde{v}_0 \\in T_{\\tilde{p}_0}\\mathbb{R}^n$.\nTherefore, the vector $dT_{-m, \\tilde{p}_1}(\\tilde{v}_1)$ has the same components as $\\tilde{v}_0$. Since it is a vector in the same tangent space $T_{\\tilde{p}_0}\\mathbb{R}^n$, it must be the same vector:\n$dT_{-m, \\tilde{p}_1}(\\tilde{v}_1) = \\tilde{v}_0$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $P_{\\gamma}(v)$:\n$P_{\\gamma}(v) = d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_0}(\\tilde{v}_0)$.\nBy the definition of the lift $\\tilde{v}_0$, we have $v = d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_0}(\\tilde{v}_0)$.\nTherefore, we conclude that $P_{\\gamma}(v) = v$ for any $v \\in T_p T^n$.\n\nThe parallel transport map $P_{\\gamma}$ along any loop $\\gamma$ on the flat torus is the identity map on the tangent space $T_p T^n$. This signifies that the holonomy group of a flat torus is trivial.\n\nThe matrix representation of this linear map, with respect to any basis of $T_p T^n$ (in particular, the standard basis induced by the Cartesian basis of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ via $d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}_0}$), is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix, which we denote by $I_n$.\nThe expression for the holonomy matrix is therefore $I_n$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{I_{n}}\n$$", "id": "3049794"}, {"introduction": "Having established that flatness implies trivial holonomy, we now investigate a quintessential curved space: the sphere.

The \"foundational facts\" provided are correct statements that guide the solution path.

This net rotation is the holonomy of the connection along the loop.\n\nThe problem statement directs us to use the foundational principle that a vector's rotation after parallel transport along a closed loop is determined by the total curvature of the region enclosed by that loop. For a region $D$ on a $2$-manifold bounded by a piecewise geodesic curve $\\gamma$, the angle of rotation, $\\Delta\\alpha$, is given by the Ambrose-Singer holonomy theorem, which in this context simplifies to the integral of the Gaussian curvature $K$ over the region $D$.\n$$\n\\Delta\\alpha = \\iint_D K \\, dA\n$$\nThis result is intimately related to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. For a geodesic triangle on a surface, the theorem states:\n$$\n\\iint_D K \\, dA + \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (\\pi - \\alpha_i) = 2\\pi\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_i$ are the interior angles of the triangle. Rearranging this gives:\n$$\n\\iint_D K \\, dA = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\alpha_i - \\pi\n$$\nThis quantity, the \"angular excess\" of the triangle, is precisely the holonomy angle $\\Delta\\alpha$.\n\nWe are given that the manifold is the unit sphere $S^2$, for which the Gaussian curvature is constant, $K=1$. Thus, the rotation angle is numerically equal to the area of the spherical triangle $pqr$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\alpha = \\iint_D (1) \\, dA = \\text{Area}(D)\n$$\nWe can determine this value by calculating the interior angles of the geodesic triangle and finding the angular excess.\n\nThe vertices of the triangle are:\n1.

The meridian to $q$ has longitude $0$, and the meridian to $r$ has longitude $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$. Therefore, the interior angle at $p$ is:\n$$\n\\alpha_p = \\theta - 0 = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians}\n$$\n\n**Angle at vertex $q$ ($\\alpha_q$):**\nThe angle at $q$ is the angle between the meridian passing through $p$ and $q$ and the equator. On a sphere, any meridian intersects the equator at a right angle. To confirm this, we can examine the tangent vectors at $q=(1,0,0)$.\n-   The geodesic from $p$ to $q$ (meridian) can be parameterized in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ by $\\gamma_1(t) = (\\sin t, 0, \\cos t)$ for $t \\in [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$.

The fiber over this point is $L_{x_0} = L_{[0]}$. Let's choose an arbitrary nonzero vector $v_0$ in this fiber. An element in the total space $L$ is an equivalence class $[(t, y)]$. The fiber $L_{[0]}$ consists of equivalence classes of pairs $(t, y)$ where $[t] = [0]$, i.e., $t \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. By the equivalence relation $(t, y) \\sim (t-1, -y)$, any such element can be written in the form $[(0, y_0)]$ for some $y_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Thus, we can represent our initial vector as $v_0 = [(0, y_0)]$ for some $y_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The fiber $L_{[0]}$ is a one-dimensional real vector space, which we can identify with $\\mathbb{R}$ via the isomorphism $y_0 \\mapsto [(0, y_0)]$.\n\nThe holonomy transformation is found by parallel transporting $v_0$ along the loop $\\gamma$. Let $s(t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ be the parallel section along $\\gamma$ with the initial condition $s(0) = v_0$. The resulting vector will be $s(1)$.\n\nThe problem defines the connection $\\nabla$ on $L$ via the trivial connection on its pullback $p^*L$ to the universal cover $\\mathbb{R}$. The loop $\\gamma(t) = [t]$ in $S^1$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ is the projection of the path $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) = t$ in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet $\\tilde{s}(t)$ be the lift of the section $s(t)$ along the path $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)=t$ in $\\mathbb{R}$. The pullback bundle $p^*L$ is identified as the trivial bundle $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ over $\\mathbb{R}$. A section $\\tilde{s}$ can be represented by a function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, which we also denote by $\\tilde{s}(t)$. The initial vector $v_0 = [(0, y_0)]$ is in the fiber over $t=0$, so its coordinate in this trivialization is $\\tilde{s}(0) = y_0$.\n\nThe condition for $s(t)$ to be parallel is that its lift $\\tilde{s}(t)$ is parallel in the trivial connection on $p^*L$. This means the lift must satisfy the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tilde{s}}{dt} = 0\n$$\nThe solution to this equation is $\\tilde{s}(t) = C$ for some constant $C \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Using the initial condition $\\tilde{s}(0) = y_0$, we find that $C=y_0$. Therefore, the lifted parallel section is given by the constant function $\\tilde{s}(t) = y_0$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$.\n\nAt the end of the path $\\tilde{\\gamma}$, at $t=1$, the value of the lifted section is $\\tilde{s}(1) = y_0$. This value represents the coordinate of the final vector $s(1)$ in the fiber $L_{\\gamma(1)} = L_{[1]}$. So, the final vector is $s(1) = [(1, y_0)]$.\n\nThe holonomy element is an endomorphism of the initial fiber $L_{[0]}$. We must therefore express the final vector $s(1) \\in L_{[1]}$ as a vector in the fiber $L_{[0]}$. The base manifold points are the same, $\\gamma(0) = [0] = [1] = \\gamma(1)$. We use the equivalence relation defining the bundle $L$: $(t, y) \\sim (t+1, -y)$.\nSetting $t=0$ and replacing $y$ with $-y_0$, we get $(0, -y_0) \\sim (0+1, -(-y_0))$, which simplifies to:\n$$\n(0, -y_0) \\sim (1, y_0)\n$$\nThis means that the equivalence class $[(1, y_0)]$ is the same as the equivalence class $[(0, -y_0)]$.\nSo, the final vector is $s(1) = [(1, y_0)] = [(0, -y_0)]$.\n\nThe parallel transport map along $\\gamma$, denoted $P_{\\gamma, 1}: L_{[0]} \\to L_{[0]}$, is the map that takes the initial vector to the final vector:\n$$\nP_{\\gamma, 1}\\left( [(0, y_0)] \\right) = [(0, -y_0)]\n$$\nUsing our identification of the fiber $L_{[0]}$ with $\\mathbb{R}$, this corresponds to the linear map $y_0 \\mapsto -y_0$. This map is multiplication by the scalar $-1$.\n\nThe holonomy element $\\mathrm{Hol}_{\\nabla}(\\gamma)$ is this scalar, which is an element of the general linear group $\\mathrm{GL}(L_{[0]}) \\cong \\mathrm{GL}(1, \\mathbb{R})$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Hol}_{\\nabla}(\\gamma) = -1\n$$\nThis result confirms that the connection has nontrivial holonomy, consistent with the fact that $L$ is the nontrivial line bundle (the Möbius band).", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-1} $$", "id": "3049817"}]}
