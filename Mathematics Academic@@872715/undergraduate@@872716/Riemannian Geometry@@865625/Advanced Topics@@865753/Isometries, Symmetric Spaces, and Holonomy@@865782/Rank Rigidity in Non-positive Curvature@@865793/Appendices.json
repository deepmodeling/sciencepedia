The point on the geodesic is $\\gamma(t) = (0, \\exp(t))$. The distance is:\n$$d(p, \\gamma(t)) = \\arccosh\\left(1 + \\frac{(x-0)^2 + (y-\\exp(t))^2}{2y\\exp(t)}\\right) = \\arccosh\\left(1 + \\frac{x^2 + y^2 - 2y\\exp(t) + \\exp(2t)}{2y\\exp(t)}\\right)$$\n$$d(p, \\gamma(t)) = \\arccosh\\left(\\frac{2y\\exp(t) + x^2 + y^2 - 2y\\exp(t) + \\exp(2t)}{2y\\exp(t)}\\right) = \\arccosh\\left(\\frac{x^2 + y^2 + \\exp(2t)}{2y\\exp(t)}\\right)$$\nTo evaluate the limit for $b_{\\gamma}(p)$, we analyze the behavior for large $t$. We use the identity $\\arccosh(z) = \\ln(z + \\sqrt{z^2-1})$. Let $z(t)$ be the argument of $\\arccosh$:\n$$z(t) = \\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2y}\\exp(-t) + \\frac{1}{2y}\\exp(t)$$\nFor large $t$, $z(t)$ grows like $\\frac{1}{2y}\\exp(t)$. We can use the asymptotic expansion $\\ln(z+\\sqrt{z^2-1}) \\approx \\ln(2z)$ for large $z$.\n$$d(p, \\gamma(t)) \\approx \\ln\\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{x^2 + y^2 + \\exp(2t)}{2y\\exp(t)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{x^2 + y^2 + \\exp(2t)}{y\\exp(t)}\\right)$$\n$$d(p, \\gamma(t)) \\approx \\ln\\left(\\frac{x^2+y^2}{y}\\exp(-t) + \\frac{1}{y}\\exp(t)\\right)$$\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{x^2+y^2}{y}\\exp(-t)$ vanishes.\n$$d(p, \\gamma(t)) \\approx \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{y}\\exp(t)\\right) = \\ln(\\exp(t)) - \\ln(y) = t - \\ln(y)$$\nThus, the Busemann function is:\n$$b_{\\gamma}(x,y) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\big(t - d(p,\\gamma(t))\\big) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\big(t - (t-\\ln(y))\\big) = \\ln(y)$$\nThe explicit formula for the Busemann function is $b_{\\gamma}(x,y) = \\ln(y)$.\n\nPart 2: Identification of the level sets\nThe level sets of $b_{\\gamma}$ are curves where $b_{\\gamma}(x,y)$ is constant.\n$$b_{\\gamma}(x,y) = C \\implies \\ln(y) = C \\implies y = \\exp(C)$$\nFor any real constant $C$, $y_0 = \\exp(C)$ is a positive constant. Thus, the level sets are the horizontal lines $y=y_0$ for any $y_0  0$. In hyperbolic geometry, these curves are known as horocycles. They are centered at the point at infinity approached by the geodesic ray $\\gamma(t)$.\n\nPart 3: Computation of the geodesic curvature $k_g$\nTo compute the geodesic curvature $k_g$, we need a unit-speed parameterization of a horocycle, say $\\alpha(s)$, with respect to the metric $g$. Let's consider the horocycle $y=y_0$. A natural parameterization is $\\tilde{\\alpha}(x)=(x, y_0)$. The tangent vector is $\\tilde{\\alpha}'(x)=(1,0)$. Its speed with respect to $g$ is:\n$$||\\tilde{\\alpha}'(x)||_g = \\sqrt{\\frac{1^2+0^2}{y_0^2}} = \\frac{1}{y_0}$$\nThe arc-length parameter $s$ is given by $ds = \\frac{1}{y_0}dx$, so $s=x/y_0$ (assuming $s=0$ at $x=0$). A unit-speed parameterization is therefore $\\alpha(s) = (y_0 s, y_0)$. The unit tangent vector is $\\dot{\\alpha}(s)=(y_0, 0)$ in the coordinate basis.\n\nThe geodesic curvature is $k_g = ||\\nabla_{\\dot{\\alpha}}\\dot{\\alpha}||_g$. We compute the covariant acceleration vector $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\alpha}}\\dot{\\alpha}$. Its components are $A^k = \\frac{d\\dot{\\alpha}^k}{ds} + \\Gamma^k_{ij}\\dot{\\alpha}^i \\dot{\\alpha}^j$.\nThe Christoffel symbols for the metric $g_{ij} = \\frac{1}{y^2}\\delta_{ij}$ are:\n$\\Gamma^1_{12} = \\Gamma^1_{21} = -1/y$\n$\\Gamma^2_{11} = 1/y$\n$\\Gamma^2_{22} = -1/y$\nAll other $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are zero.\nThe tangent vector has components $\\dot{\\alpha}^1=y_0$ and $\\dot{\\alpha}^2=0$. Its derivative $\\frac{d\\dot{\\alpha}}{ds}$ is zero.\nThe components of the acceleration vector are:\n$$A^1 = \\Gamma^1_{11}(\\dot{\\alpha}^1)^2 + 2\\Gamma^1_{12}\\dot{\\alpha}^1 \\dot{\\alpha}^2 + \\Gamma^1_{22}(\\dot{\\alpha}^2)^2 = 0$$\n$$A^2 = \\Gamma^2_{11}(\\dot{\\alpha}^1)^2 + 2\\Gamma^2_{12}\\dot{\\alpha}^1 \\dot{\\alpha}^2 + \\Gamma^2_{22}(\\dot{\\alpha}^2)^2 = \\Gamma^2_{11}(y_0)^2$$\nWe evaluate the Christoffel symbol along the curve, where $y=y_0$: $\\Gamma^2_{11} = 1/y_0$.\n$$A^2 = \\frac{1}{y_0}(y_0)^2 = y_0$$\nThe acceleration vector is $A = (0, y_0)$. Its norm is the geodesic curvature:\n$$k_g = ||A||_g = \\sqrt{g_{ij}A^iA^j} = \\sqrt{g_{22}(A^2)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{y_0^2}(y_0)^2} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$$\nThe geodesic curvature of any horocycle in $\\mathbb{H}^2$ is $1$.\n\nPart 4: Connection to Rank 1 and Jacobi Fields\nA Riemannian manifold with non-positive sectional curvature is said to be of rank 1 if for every geodesic, the only parallel Jacobi fields are those tangent to the geodesic. This is equivalent to stating that there are no non-trivial parallel normal Jacobi fields.\n\nLet's verify this for $\\mathbb{H}^2$. A parallel field $J$ along a geodesic $\\gamma$ satisfies $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J = 0$, which implies its covariant derivatives $J', J''$ are zero. A Jacobi field satisfies $J'' + R(J,\\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}=0$. A parallel Jacobi field must therefore satisfy $R(J,\\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}=0$.\nFor $\\mathbb{H}^2$, the sectional curvature is $K=-1$. The curvature tensor is $R(X,Y)Z = -(g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y)$.\nThe condition becomes:\n$$- (g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma})J - g(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}) = 0$$\nSince $\\gamma$ is unit-speed, $g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma})=1$.\n$$- (J - g(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}) = 0$$\nThe term $g(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}$ is the component of $J$ parallel to $\\dot{\\gamma}$, denoted $J^{\\top}$. The term $J - J^{\\top}$ is the component of $J$ normal to $\\dot{\\gamma}$, denoted $J^{\\perp}$. The condition for a parallel Jacobi field is thus $J^{\\perp}=0$.\nThis means any parallel Jacobi field must be tangent to the geodesic. If a parallel Jacobi field $J$ were also normal ($g(J, \\dot{\\gamma})=0$), then its tangential component $J^{\\top}$ is zero. But the condition $J^{\\perp}=0$ implies its normal component is also zero. Thus $J=0$. There are no non-trivial parallel normal Jacobi fields in $\\mathbb{H}^2$, which is a manifestation of its rank 1 nature.\n\nThe geodesic curvature $k_g=1$ of horocycles is a direct geometric consequence of this property. The existence of a non-trivial parallel normal Jacobi field along a geodesic $\\gamma$ would imply the existence of a \"flat strip\": a totally geodesic, flat (curvature $0$) surface containing $\\gamma$. The curves in this strip orthogonal to $\\gamma$ would themselves have to be geodesics to maintain the constant distance between the strip's boundary geodesics. Such orthogonal curves would have a geodesic curvature of $k_g=0$.\n\nHowever, in $\\mathbb{H}^2$, the curves that are orthogonal to a family of asymptotic geodesics (like the vertical lines asymptotic to $\\gamma$) are the horocycles. We have computed their geodesic curvature to be $k_g=1$, not $0$. The fact that this curvature is strictly positive forbids the existence of such flat strips. The specific value $k_g=1$ is directly tied to the sectional curvature being $K=-1$; for a space of constant curvature $K=-c^2$, the horocycles have geodesic curvature $k_g=c$. Thus, the non-zero geodesic curvature of horocycles is the geometric representation of the absence of parallel normal Jacobi fields, which defines the rank 1 property.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\ln(y)  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3062598"}, {"introduction": "Having explored a rank-1 space, we now turn to the simplest example of a higher-rank manifold: the flat torus $T^2$.

This means that on a flat manifold, any parallel vector field along a geodesic is automatically a Jacobi field. Our task thus reduces to finding all parallel vector fields along the specified closed geodesic $\\gamma$.\n\nTo facilitate the analysis, we work in the universal covering space of the torus, which is the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with its standard flat metric. The covariant derivative $\\nabla$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with standard Cartesian coordinates corresponds to the ordinary differentiation of the vector components. The geodesic $\\gamma$ on the torus is the projection of a straight line $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) = x_{0} + tv$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, where $v = (p,q)$ is a constant vector. The velocity vector of this lifted geodesic is $\\dot{\\tilde{\\gamma}}(t) = v$, which is a constant vector field along $\\tilde{\\gamma}$.\n\nLet $\\tilde{J}(t)$ be a vector field along $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)$ in the covering space. The condition for $\\tilde{J}(t)$ to be parallel along $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)$ is $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\tilde{\\gamma}}} \\tilde{J}(t) = 0$. In the Euclidean setting of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, this equation becomes a simple ordinary differential equation for the vector-valued function $\\tilde{J}(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\tilde{J}(t) = 0\n$$\nThe solution is that $\\tilde{J}(t)$ must be a constant vector, i.e., $\\tilde{J}(t) = C$ for some vector $C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ that is constant with respect to the parameter $t$.\n\nNext, we must ensure that such a vector field $\\tilde{J}(t)$ on the covering space projects to a well-defined vector field $J(t)$ on the torus $T^{2}$. A field on the cover descends to a well-defined field on the quotient manifold if and only if it is equivariant under the action of the deck group. The geodesic $\\gamma$ is closed, which is a consequence of $v$ being an integer vector. The problem statement indicates that the deck transformation $\\tau_v: x \\mapsto x+v$ corresponding to the vector $v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$ is responsible for closing the geodesic. Specifically, $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t+1) = x_0 + (t+1)v = (x_0+tv)+v = \\tau_v(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))$. The projection $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to T^2$ satisfies $\\pi \\circ \\tau_v = \\pi$, so $\\pi(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t+1)) = \\pi(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))$, confirming the periodicity.\n\nFor $\\tilde{J}(t)$ to descend to a field on $T^2$, it must satisfy the equivariance condition with respect to $\\tau_v$. This condition relates the vector at a point $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)$ to the vector at the transformed point $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t+1)$ via the differential of the deck transformation:\n$$\nd(\\tau_v)_{\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)}(\\tilde{J}(t)) = \\tilde{J}(t+1)\n$$\nThe deck transformation $\\tau_v(x) = x+v$ is a translation in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Its differential (or Jacobian matrix), $d(\\tau_v)_x$, is the identity map $Id: T_x\\mathbb{R}^2 \\to T_{x+v}\\mathbb{R}^2$ for any point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. Thus, applying the differential to $\\tilde{J}(t)$ simply yields $\\tilde{J}(t)$. The equivariance condition simplifies to:\n$$\n\\tilde{J}(t) = \\tilde{J}(t+1)\n$$\nWe have already established that for $\\tilde{J}(t)$ to be a parallel field, it must be a constant vector, $\\tilde{J}(t)=C$. Substituting this into the well-definedness condition, we get $C=C$. This is a tautology, which means it holds for any constant vector $C \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThis demonstrates that any constant vector field along the line $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ corresponds to a well-defined parallel Jacobi field along the closed geodesic $\\gamma$ on $T^2$. The space of such fields is therefore the space of all constant vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This is a real vector space isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$ itself. The dimension of this vector space is equal to the dimension of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which is $2$.\n\nThe problem asks for the general form of such a field in terms of the given vectors $v=(p,q)$ and $v^{\\perp}=(-q,p)$. The vector $v$ is primitive, meaning $\\gcd(p,q)=1$, so it is non-zero. The vector $v^{\\perp}$ is also non-zero and is orthogonal to $v$, as their dot product is $\\langle v, v^{\\perp} \\rangle = p(-q) + q(p) = 0$. In a $2$-dimensional space, two non-zero orthogonal vectors are necessarily linearly independent and thus form a basis.\nTherefore, any constant vector $C \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, which represents a lifted parallel Jacobi field, can be expressed as a unique linear combination of $v$ and $v^{\\perp}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{J}(t) = C = a_1 v + a_2 v^{\\perp}\n$$\nfor arbitrary real scalar coefficients $a_1, a_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

The rigidity part of the theorem states that if equality holds, i.e., $d(\\gamma_1(a), \\gamma_2(b)) = \\tilde{c}$, for a non-degenerate hinge ($a,b  0$, $\\theta \\in (0,\\pi)$), then the geodesic triangle formed by $p$, $\\gamma_1(a)$, and $\\gamma_2(b)$ (including the minimal geodesic connecting $\\gamma_1(a)$ and $\\gamma_2(b)$) must bound a totally geodesic, flat surface. A \"flat surface\" is a 2-dimensional submanifold which, with the induced metric, is isometric to a domain in the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n\"Totally geodesic\" means that any geodesic of the surface (with the induced metric) is also a geodesic of the ambient manifold $M$. A key property of a totally geodesic submanifold is that the sectional curvature of the ambient manifold for any 2-plane tangent to the submanifold is equal to the intrinsic sectional curvature of the submanifold.\n\nIn our case, the existence of a flat, totally geodesic surface $S$ containing the hinge implies that for any point $q \\in S$ and any 2-plane $\\pi \\subset T_qS$, the sectional curvature of the ambient manifold $M$ must be zero, i.e., $K_M(\\pi) = 0$.\n\nLet us now evaluate each option based on this fundamental result.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The sectional curvature of the $2$-plane $\\sigma = \\operatorname{span}\\{\\dot{\\gamma}_1(0),\\dot{\\gamma}_2(0)\\}$ at $p$ is zero.**\n\nThe rigidity theorem implies the existence of a flat, totally geodesic surface $S \\subset M$ that contains the geodesics $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$. Since $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ lie in $S$ and start at $p$, their initial velocity vectors $\\dot{\\gamma}_1(0)$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}_2(0)$ must be tangent to $S$ at $p$. Since these two vectors are linearly independent (because $\\theta \\in (0,\\pi)$), they span the tangent plane to the surface $S$ at $p$. That is, $\\sigma = T_pS$. Because $S$ is a flat surface, its intrinsic curvature is zero everywhere. Since $S$ is also totally geodesic, the sectional curvature of $M$ for any plane tangent to $S$ must be zero. In particular, for the tangent plane $\\sigma = T_pS$, we must have $K_M(\\sigma) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, this statement is a direct and necessary consequence of the equality condition.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. If $J$ is the Jacobi field along $\\gamma_1$ obtained by varying the initial direction from $\\dot{\\gamma}_1(0)$ toward $\\dot{\\gamma}_2(0)$ with $J(0)=0$, then $J''(t) = 0$ and $\\langle R(J(t),\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t))\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t), J(t)\\rangle \\equiv 0$ for all $t \\in [0,a]$.**\n\nA Jacobi field $J(t)$ along a geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ describes the infinitesimal behavior of a variation of nearby geodesics. The Jacobi field mentioned is generated by a variation of geodesics $\\alpha_s(t)$ which all start at $p$ and whose initial velocities $\\dot{\\alpha}_s(0)$ vary from $\\dot{\\gamma}_1(0)$ (at $s=0$) towards $\\dot{\\gamma}_2(0)$. This variation can be constructed to take place entirely within the 2-plane $\\sigma = \\operatorname{span}\\{\\dot{\\gamma}_1(0), \\dot{\\gamma}_2(0)\\}$.\nSince the surface $S$ (with tangent plane $\\sigma$ at $p$) is totally geodesic, all geodesics starting at $p$ with initial velocity in $\\sigma$ remain in $S$ for all time. Thus, the entire variation $\\alpha_s(t)$ takes place within $S$. This implies that for any $t$, the Jacobi field vector $J(t) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}|_{s=0} \\alpha_s(t)$ is tangent to $S$ at the point $\\gamma_1(t)$. The velocity vector $\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t)$ is also tangent to $S$.\nThe Jacobi equation is $J''(t) + R(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}_1(t))\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t) = 0$, where $J''$ is the second covariant derivative of $J$ along $\\gamma_1$.\nThe term $\\langle R(J(t),\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t))\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t), J(t)\\rangle$ is related to the sectional curvature $K(\\pi_t)$ of the plane $\\pi_t = \\operatorname{span}\\{J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}_1(t)\\}$. Specifically, $\\langle R(J(t),\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t))\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t), J(t)\\rangle = -K(\\pi_t) \\|\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t) \\wedge J(t)\\|^2$.\nSince $J(t)$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t)$ are both tangent to the flat, totally geodesic surface $S$, the plane $\\pi_t$ is a tangent plane to $S$. Therefore, the sectional curvature $K(\\pi_t)$ must be $0$ for all $t \\in [0, a]$. This directly implies that $\\langle R(J(t),\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t))\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t), J(t)\\rangle \\equiv 0$.\nFurthermore, since $S$ is a flat totally geodesic surface, the curvature tensor of $M$ restricted to tangent vectors of $S$ is zero. That is, for any vectors $U, V, W$ tangent to $S$ at some point, $R(U,V)W = 0$. In our case, $J(t)$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t)$ are tangent to $S$ for all $t$. Thus, the curvature term $R(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}_1(t))\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t)$ is identically the zero vector.\nThe Jacobi equation then simplifies to $J''(t) + 0 = 0$, which is $J''(t)=0$.\nBoth claims in the option are correct.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Equality can hold on a nondegenerate hinge in a simply connected space of constant negative curvature for a unique nonzero pair $(a,b)$ and angle $\\theta$.**\n\nLet $M$ be a simply connected space of constant negative curvature, $K \\equiv -k^2$ for some constant $k0$. For the equality $c = \\tilde{c}$ to hold, the geodesic hinge must span a flat ($K=0$) totally geodesic surface. However, in a manifold where the sectional curvature of *every* 2-plane is strictly negative, it is impossible for a totally geodesic surface to be flat. Any 2-dimensional totally geodesic submanifold must have the same constant sectional curvature as the ambient space, i.e., $-k^2$. Therefore, no such flat surface can exist.\nThis means that in a manifold of strictly negative curvature, the inequality is always strict: $c  \\tilde{c}$ for any non-degenerate hinge. The equality can never hold. The statement that it can hold for a \"unique\" pair is therefore false.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Equality implies only that the angle at $p$ equals its Euclidean comparison angle, but it provides no information about the curvature of $M$.**\n\nThe first part of the statement is misleading. The angle at $p$ *is* the angle of the Euclidean comparison hinge by definition. The comparison theorem relates the side lengths and the other two angles. However, the second part of the statement is definitively false. As established in the analysis of options A and B, the equality $c=\\tilde{c}$ provides very specific and crucial information about the curvature of $M$: it forces the sectional curvature of the 2-plane spanned by the hinge to be zero at the vertex $p$. This contradicts the claim that it provides \"no information about the curvature\".\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Equality forces the entire manifold $M$ to be flat.**\n\nThe equality forces the specific 2-dimensional surface containing the triangle to be flat and totally geodesic. It does not impose conditions on curvatures of planes that are not tangent to this surface. To disprove this statement, we can provide a counterexample.\nConsider the Riemannian product manifold $M = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\times H^2$, where $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is the Euclidean plane and $H^2$ is the hyperbolic plane with constant curvature $-1$. The sectional curvature of $M$ for a plane spanned by vectors tangent to the $\\mathbb{R}^2$ factor is $0$. The sectional curvature for a plane spanned by vectors tangent to the $H^2$ factor is $-1$. For a mixed plane (one vector from each factor), the curvature is $0$. Therefore, the sectional curvature of $M$ satisfies $K \\le 0$.\nNow, choose a point $p=(p_{\\mathbb{R}}, p_{H}) \\in M$. Consider two geodesics $\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2$ that lie entirely within the submanifold $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\times \\{p_{H}\\}$. This submanifold is isometric to $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and is totally geodesic in $M$. Any geodesic triangle within this submanifold will be a normal Euclidean triangle, so the equality $c=\\tilde{c}$ will hold. However, the manifold $M = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\times H^2$ is not flat, as it contains planes with sectional curvature $-1$.\nThus, equality for one hinge does not force the entire manifold to be flat.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "3062625"}]}
