This guarantees the $0$-connected condition: the map $\\pi_{0}(\\partial M) \\to \\pi_{0}(M)$ is an isomorphism, and the relative $\\pi_{0}(M,\\partial M,x_{0})$ is trivial.\n\nTo test the $1$-connected condition, use the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair:\n$$\n\\pi_{1}(\\partial M,x_{0}) \\xrightarrow{i_{*}} \\pi_{1}(M,x_{0}) \\xrightarrow{j_{*}} \\pi_{1}(M,\\partial M,x_{0}) \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\pi_{0}(\\partial M) \\xrightarrow{} \\pi_{0}(M).\n$$\nSince both $M$ and $\\partial M$ are path-connected, the map $\\pi_{0}(\\partial M) \\to \\pi_{0}(M)$ is an isomorphism, so its kernel is $0$.
