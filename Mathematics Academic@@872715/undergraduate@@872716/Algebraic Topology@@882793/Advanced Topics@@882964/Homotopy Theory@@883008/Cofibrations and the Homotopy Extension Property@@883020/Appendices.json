Let $A$ be the boundary of the Möbius strip, which is formed by the identified top and bottom edges of the rectangle and is topologically a single circle.\n\nA pair of topological spaces $(X, A)$ with $A \\subseteq X$ is said to have the Homotopy Extension Property (HEP) if the inclusion map $i: A \\hookrightarrow X$ is a cofibration. A standard theorem in algebraic topology states that $(X, A)$ has the HEP if and only if there exists a retraction from the space $X \\times [0,1]$ to its subspace $(X \\times \\{0\\}) \\cup (A \\times [0,1])$. A retraction is a continuous map from a space to a subspace that is the identity on that subspace.\n\nIt is a known result that the pair $(M, A)$ has the HEP. Your task is to identify the key geometric feature of the pair $(M, A)$ that allows for the construction of the required retraction.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct reasoning for why the pair $(M,A)$ has the Homotopy Extension Property?\n\nA. The Möbius strip $M$ deformation retracts onto its core circle. Since $M$ is homotopy equivalent to a circle, properties related to homotopy are simplified, and this allows for the extension of any homotopy defined on its boundary $A$.\n\nB. The fundamental group of the boundary, $\\pi_1(A)$, is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$, and the fundamental group of the Möbius strip, $\\pi_1(M)$, is also isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$. The inclusion mapping $i: A \\hookrightarrow M$ induces an injective homomorphism between these groups. This algebraic injectivity on the level of fundamental groups is a sufficient condition for the geometric property of homotopy extension.\n\nC. The region of the Möbius strip immediately adjacent to its boundary circle $A$ has a uniform, product-like structure. This neighborhood, often called a \"collar\", is homeomorphic to $A \\times [0,1)$. This regular structure near the boundary provides the necessary \"room\" to define a continuous retraction that pushes points of $M \\times [0,1]$ onto the required subspace $(M \\times \\{0\\}) \\cup (A \\times [0,1])$.\n\nD. The Möbius strip is a non-orientable surface. This global topological property implies a \"twist\" that connects all regions of the space, ensuring that any local deformation (a homotopy on the boundary $A$) can always be extended to a global deformation on the entire strip $M$.\n\nE. Because the Möbius strip $M$ is a compact metric space, it is a normal space. By Urysohn's Lemma, for the closed set $A$ and any point not in $A$, we can construct a continuous function that separates them.

This product-like neighborhood is the key geometric feature.\n\nUsing the collar, we construct explicitly a retraction $r: M \\times [0,1] \\to (M \\times \\{0\\}) \\cup (A \\times [0,1])$ as follows. For $x \\in M \\setminus U$, define\n$$\nr(x,s) = (x,0).\n$$\nFor $x \\in U$, write uniquely $x=c(a,t)$ with $a \\in A$ and $t \\in [0,1)$.

Thus $r$ is the identity on $(M \\times \\{0\\}) \\cup (A \\times [0,1])$. Moreover, for $x \\notin U$ the image lies in $M \\times \\{0\\}$, and for $x \\in U$ the image lies in $A \\times [0,1]$ once $s \\geq t$, so the image of $r$ is contained in $(M \\times \\{0\\}) \\cup (A \\times [0,1])$. Continuity of $r$ follows from the continuity of $c$ and the fact that the two branches agree at $s=t$. Hence $r$ is a retraction as required, proving that $(M,A)$ has the HEP.\n\nTherefore, the key geometric feature enabling the construction is the collar neighborhood of the boundary, as stated in option C. The other options do not provide correct reasons: deformation retraction onto the core circle (A) does not address the boundary inclusion as a cofibration; injectivity on fundamental groups (B) is not sufficient for HEP; non-orientability (D) is irrelevant to cofibration; normality and Urysohn’s Lemma (E) do not yield the specific retraction required for HEP.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1640778"}, {"introduction": "To truly master a concept, it is as important to understand when it fails as when it succeeds.
