This requires decomposing $X$ into a union of two open sets, $U$ and $V$.\n\nLet's choose the open sets $U$ and $V$ as follows. Let $H_p$ be an open half-plane containing $p$ and not $q$, and let $H_q$ be an open half-plane containing $q$ and not $p$, such that $H_p \\cup H_q = \\mathbb{R}^2$.

This intersection is an open strip, which is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nNow we need the cohomology with compact supports for these pieces:\n1.  $U = H_p \\setminus \\{p\\}$: The open half-plane $H_p$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Thus, $U$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{\\text{point}\\}$. Let's call this space $Y$. By Poincaré duality, $H_c^k(Y) \\cong H_{2-k}(Y)$. Since $Y$ is homotopy equivalent to a circle $S^1$, its homology is $H_1(Y) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_0(Y) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, $H_c^1(Y) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_c^2(Y) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n2.  $V = H_q \\setminus \\{q\\}$: Similarly, $V$ is also homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{\\text{point}\\}$, so its compactly supported cohomology is the same as for $U$.\n3.  $U \\cap V$: This is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$.
