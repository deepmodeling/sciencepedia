Each of $D_{+}$ and $D_{-}$ is path-connected (indeed convex arcs within each half-disk connect any two points).\n\nIt remains to show there is no path in $D\\setminus J$ from a point of $D_{+}$ to a point of $D_{-}$. Suppose $\\gamma:[0,1]\\to D\\setminus J$ is continuous with $\\gamma(0)\\in D_{+}$ and $\\gamma(1)\\in D_{-}$. Write $\\gamma(t)=(x(t),y(t))$. Then $x(0)>0$ and $x(1)<0$.

While a simple circle works, this problem explores a more intricate case: the figure-eight. By trying to find the largest possible connected open set whose boundary is contained within a figure-eight, you will discover a profound limitation on what constitutes a valid boundary for a single region. This exercise provides hands-on insight into the deeper implications of separation theorems, particularly regarding the topology of the boundary itself.

We are looking for a non-empty, open, connected, and bounded set $U \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ such that its boundary $\\partial U$ is a subset of $X$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the relationship between $U$ and $X$. Since $U$ is an open set, it is disjoint from its boundary, i.e., $U \\cap \\partial U = \\emptyset$. The problem states that $\\partial U \\subseteq X$. This implies that $U \\cap X = \\emptyset$. Therefore, the set $U$ must be entirely contained within the complement of $X$, which is $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus X$.\n\nNext, we identify the connected components of $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus X$. The set $X$ consists of two circles tangent at the origin. It partitions the plane into three disjoint open regions:\n1.  $R_1$: The interior of the circle $C_1$. This is the open disk defined by $(x-1)^2 + y^2 < 1$. This region is bounded.\n2.  $R_2$: The interior of the circle $C_2$. This is the open disk defined by $(x+1)^2 + y^2 < 1$. This region is also bounded.\n3.  $R_3$: The region exterior to both circles, defined by $(x-1)^2 + y^2 > 1$ and $(x+1)^2 + y^2 > 1$. This region is unbounded.\n\nThe set $U$ is given to be connected. Since $U$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus X = R_1 \\cup R_2 \\cup R_3$, and the regions $R_1, R_2, R_3$ are disjoint, a connected subset $U$ must lie entirely within one of these components. If $U$ had points in more than one component, any path within $U$ connecting these points would have to cross $X$, which is not possible as $U \\cap X = \\emptyset$.\n\nThe problem states that $U$ is a bounded set. The component $R_3$ is unbounded, so $U$ cannot be a subset of $R_3$. Therefore, $U$ must be a subset of either $R_1$ or $R_2$.\n\nLet's examine these two cases:\n\nCase 1: $U \\subseteq R_1$.\nWe need to check the boundary condition $\\partial U \\subseteq X$. The closure of $R_1$ is the closed disk $\\overline{R_1} = \\{(x,y) \\mid (x-1)^2 + y^2 \\le 1\\}$, and its boundary is $\\partial R_1 = C_1$. Since $U \\subseteq R_1$, its closure $\\bar{U}$ is a subset of $\\overline{R_1}$. The boundary of $U$ is $\\partial U = \\bar{U} \\setminus U$. Thus, $\\partial U \\subseteq \\bar{U} \\subseteq \\overline{R_1}$.\nThe condition $\\partial U \\subseteq X = C_1 \\cup C_2$ combined with $\\partial U \\subseteq \\overline{R_1}$ implies that $\\partial U \\subseteq \\overline{R_1} \\cap (C_1 \\cup C_2)$. The intersection of the closed disk $\\overline{R_1}$ with the set $X$ is precisely the circle $C_1$. So, the condition becomes $\\partial U \\subseteq C_1$. This is compatible with the requirement $\\partial U \\subseteq X$.\nTo maximize the area of $U$ in this case, we should choose $U$ to be as large as possible. The largest possible choice for $U$ is $R_1$ itself. If we set $U = R_1$, then $U$ is open, connected, and bounded. Its boundary is $\\partial R_1 = C_1$, which is a subset of $X$. Thus, $U=R_1$ is a valid candidate. The area of $R_1$ is the area of a disk with radius $r=1$, which is $\\text{Area}(R_1) = \\pi r^2 = \\pi(1)^2 = \\pi$.\n\nCase 2: $U \\subseteq R_2$.\nThe reasoning is identical to Case 1. To satisfy the conditions and maximize the area, we can choose $U=R_2$. The boundary is $\\partial R_2 = C_2$, which is a subset of $X$. The area of $R_2$ is also $\\pi$.\n\nSince $U$ must be contained in either $R_1$ or $R_2$, the area of $U$ cannot exceed the area of these regions. The maximum area is achieved when $U=R_1$ or $U=R_2$. In both cases, the maximum area is $\\pi$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi}$$", "id": "1672729"}, {"introduction": "Separation properties are not just about the curve being removed, but also about the space it lives in.
