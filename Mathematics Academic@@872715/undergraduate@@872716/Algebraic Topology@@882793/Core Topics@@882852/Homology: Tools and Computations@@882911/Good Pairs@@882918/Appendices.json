Let $r: U \\to K$ be the retraction map, defined by $r(x) = H(x, 1)$. Since $U$ is an open set containing $0$, there must exist some $\\epsilon > 0$ such that the interval $[0, \\epsilon)$ is contained in $U$. The set $[0, \\epsilon)$ is path-connected. Because $r$ is continuous, its image $r([0, \\epsilon))$ must be a path-connected subset of $K$. However, any path-connected subset of $K$ must be a single point, since all points of $K$ other than $0$ are isolated. This means $r$ must map the entire interval $[0, \\epsilon)$ to a single point in $K$. Since $r$ must fix the points of $K$, we have $r(0) = 0$. Therefore, $r(x)=0$ for all $x \\in [0, \\epsilon)$. But for a large enough integer $N$, the point $1/N$ is in $[0, \\epsilon)$ and is also in $K$. The retraction must fix this point, so $r(1/N) = 1/N$. This contradicts $r(1/N) = 0$.

The property of being a good pair is crucial for relating relative homology to the homology of a quotient space.\n\nConsider the solid torus $X = S^1 \\times D^2$, where $S^1$ is the unit circle and $D^2$ is the closed unit disk in the complex plane.

The meridional disk $M$ deformation retracts to the point $p=(\\theta_{0},0)$ which lies on the core circle $C$. This deformation can be performed within $A$ while keeping $C$ fixed. Therefore, the entire space $A$ deformation retracts onto $C$, which is homeomorphic to $S^{1}$. Since $A$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^1$, its fundamental group is $\\pi_{1}(A)\\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, so $A$ is not contractible. Thus, statement A is false.\n\nStatement B claims $(X,A)$ is a good pair because $A$ is a CW subcomplex. With the standard product CW structure on $X=S^{1}\\times D^{2}$, the core circle $C=S^{1}\\times\\{0\\}$ is not a subcomplex because the point $\\{0\\}$ is in the interior of the 2-cell of $D^2$, not in its boundary. Thus $A$ cannot be a subcomplex. Statement B is false.\n\nStatement E claims the pair is good because both spaces are homotopy equivalent to $S^1$. While it is true that $X \\simeq S^1$ and $A \\simeq S^1$, this fact does not guarantee that the pair is good. The good pair condition depends on the local geometry of the embedding, not just the homotopy types of the spaces. Thus, E is false.\n\nNow consider statement C. Both $H_1(A)$ and $H_1(X)$ are isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$, since both spaces are homotopy equivalent to $S^1$. The inclusion map $i: A \\to X$ sends the generator of $H_1(A)$ (represented by the core circle $C$) to the generator of $H_1(X)$. Thus, the induced map $i_*: H_1(A) \\to H_1(X)$ is an isomorphism. Therefore, the reason given in statement C for the pair not being good is incorrect.\n\nThe correct statement is D. The pair $(X, A)$ is not a good pair because $A$ is not a neighborhood deformation retract. This can be proven by contradiction using the main theorem for good pairs.\n1.  First, we compute the relative homology groups $H_n(X, A)$ using the long exact sequence of the pair.\n    $$\n    \\dots \\to H_{2}(X)\\to H_{2}(X,A)\\xrightarrow{\\partial} H_{1}(A)\\xrightarrow{i_{*}} H_{1}(X)\\to H_{1}(X,A)\\to \\dots\n    $$\n    We have $H_2(X) = 0$ (since $X \\simeq S^1$) and, as established above, the map $i_*: H_1(A) \\to H_1(X)$ is an isomorphism. Exactness of the sequence implies that the boundary map $\\partial$ must be the zero map, and its kernel is all of $H_2(X,A)$. Since $H_2(X)=0$, the map $H_2(X) \\to H_2(X,A)$ is also zero. This forces $H_2(X,A)=0$. Similarly, since $i_*$ is an isomorphism, exactness implies $H_1(X,A)=0$. For all other degrees, $H_n(X,A)$ is also 0.\n2.  If $(X, A)$ were a good pair, the theorem would give an isomorphism $H_n(X, A) \\cong \\tilde{H}_n(X/A)$ for all $n$. This would mean that the quotient space $X/A$ is acyclic, i.e., $\\tilde{H}_n(X/A)=0$ for all $n$.\n3.  However, we can show that $\\tilde{H}_2(X/A) \\neq 0$. The quotient space $X/A$ is formed by taking the solid torus $X$ and collapsing the subspace $A$ to a single point. A technical argument (for instance, using Mayer-Vietoris or a careful analysis of the quotient map on the boundary of $X$) shows that $X/A$ is homotopy equivalent to a 2-sphere, $S^2$.\n4.  Since $X/A \\simeq S^2$, its reduced homology is $\\tilde{H}_2(X/A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. This is a non-zero group.\n\nThis result, $\\tilde{H}_2(X/A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, contradicts the conclusion from the long exact sequence that $H_2(X,A)=0$. Since the theorem $H_n(X,A) \\cong \\tilde{H}_n(X/A)$ leads to a contradiction, its premise—that $(X,A)$ is a good pair—must be false. The failure occurs because $A$ is not a neighborhood deformation retract, specifically at the points of intersection between the core circle $C$ and the meridional disk $M$.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1652911"}]}
