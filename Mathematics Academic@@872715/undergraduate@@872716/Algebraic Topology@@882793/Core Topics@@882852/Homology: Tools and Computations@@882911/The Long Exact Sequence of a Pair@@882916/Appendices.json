We will show that the map $i_{n*}: H_n(A) \\to H_n(X)$ (we will write $i_*$ for simplicity) must be both injective and surjective for all $n \\ge 0$.\n\nFirst, let's prove that $i_*$ is surjective.

Therefore, the kernel of $j_*$ is the entire domain, $\\ker(j_*) = H_n(X)$.\nBy the property of exactness, the image of the preceding map must be equal to the kernel of the next map. Thus, we have $\\operatorname{Im}(i_*) = \\ker(j_*)$.\nSubstituting our finding for $\\ker(j_*)$, we get $\\operatorname{Im}(i_*) = H_n(X)$.

The sequence segment thus simplifies to:\n$$ \\{0\\} \\xrightarrow{\\partial_{n+1}} H_n(A) \\xrightarrow{i_*} H_n(X) $$\nThe map $\\partial_{n+1}$ is a homomorphism from the trivial group $\\{0\\}$ to $H_n(A)$.
