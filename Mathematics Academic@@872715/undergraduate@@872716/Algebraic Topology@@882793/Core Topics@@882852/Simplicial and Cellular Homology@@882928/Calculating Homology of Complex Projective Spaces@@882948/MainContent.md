## Introduction
Complex [projective spaces](@entry_id:157963), denoted $\mathbb{C}P^n$, are among the most fundamental objects in geometry and topology. Their rich structure makes them a key testing ground for theories and a building block for more complex constructions. To fully understand and utilize these spaces, one must first grasp their basic [topological invariants](@entry_id:138526), chief among them being their homology groups. This article addresses the essential question: how does one systematically compute the homology of $\mathbb{C}P^n$? While the result is famously simple, the paths to its discovery reveal deep connections within algebraic topology and showcase a range of powerful computational techniques.

We will embark on this exploration in three parts. The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, will lay the groundwork by introducing the CW [complex structure](@entry_id:269128) of $\mathbb{C}P^n$ and using it to perform a direct calculation via [cellular homology](@entry_id:157864), later corroborating the result with inductive methods and the Gysin sequence. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, will demonstrate why this calculation is so important, exploring how the homology of $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is applied to distinguish topological spaces, constrain [continuous maps](@entry_id:153855), and connect to deep results in differential and algebraic geometry. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** will provide a set of guided exercises to solidify your understanding and develop your computational skills. Let us begin by delving into the principles that make this calculation possible.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delves into the principles and mechanisms for computing the homology of complex [projective spaces](@entry_id:157963). We will primarily leverage the elegant cellular structure of these spaces to perform explicit calculations. Subsequently, we will explore more advanced techniques, such as long [exact sequences](@entry_id:151503) and the Gysin sequence, to not only corroborate our findings but also to illustrate deeper structural properties and connections within algebraic topology.

### The Cellular Structure of Complex Projective Spaces

A cornerstone for understanding the topology of the [complex projective space](@entry_id:268402) $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is its structure as a **CW complex** (or [cell complex](@entry_id:262638)). This structure is remarkably simple and provides a powerful computational handle. The standard CW structure on $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is constructed as follows:

- For each integer $k$ from $0$ to $n$, there is exactly one cell of dimension $2k$, which we denote as $e^{2k}$.
- There are no cells of odd dimension.

This means that $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is built by starting with a $0$-cell, $e^0$ (a single point), which is $\mathbb{C}P^0$. Then, $\mathbb{C}P^1$ is formed by attaching a $2$-cell, $e^2$, to $\mathbb{C}P^0$. Inductively, $\mathbb{C}P^k$ is constructed from $\mathbb{C}P^{k-1}$ by attaching a single $2k$-cell, $e^{2k}$. The entire space $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is the final result of this process, being the union of cells $e^0, e^2, \dots, e^{2n}$.

This cellular decomposition has a profound consequence for the **[cellular chain complex](@entry_id:160435)**, which is used to compute [cellular homology](@entry_id:157864). The $k$-th chain group of the [cellular chain complex](@entry_id:160435), denoted $C_k^{\text{cell}}(\mathbb{C}P^n; \mathbb{Z})$, is a free abelian group generated by the $k$-cells of the space. Given the [cell structure](@entry_id:266491) of $\mathbb{C}P^n$, its cellular chain groups with integer coefficients are:

$$
C_k(\mathbb{C}P^n; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \begin{cases} \mathbb{Z}  & \text{if } k \text{ is even and } 0 \le k \le 2n \\ \{0\} & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
$$

Here, and throughout this chapter, we will omit the superscript "cell" and coefficient group $\mathbb{Z}$ for brevity when the context is clear, writing $C_k(\mathbb{C}P^n)$.

### Direct Calculation via Cellular Homology

Cellular homology provides a direct and efficient method for computing the homology of a CW complex. The $k$-th homology group, $H_k(X)$, is defined as the quotient of the kernel of the boundary map $d_k$ by the image of the boundary map $d_{k+1}$:

$$
H_k(X) \cong \frac{\ker(d_k: C_k(X) \to C_{k-1}(X))}{\text{im}(d_{k+1}: C_{k+1}(X) \to C_k(X))}
$$

For $\mathbb{C}P^n$, a crucial property of its standard cellular structure is that all boundary maps $d_k$ in the [cellular chain complex](@entry_id:160435) are zero maps. This can be seen by examining the domain and [codomain](@entry_id:139336) of these maps. For an even-dimensional cell $e^{2j}$, the boundary map $d_{2j}$ maps from $C_{2j}(\mathbb{C}P^n)$ to $C_{2j-1}(\mathbb{C}P^n)$. Since there are no odd-dimensional cells, $C_{2j-1}(\mathbb{C}P^n) = \{0\}$, and thus $d_{2j}$ must be the zero map. For an odd dimension $2j+1$, the chain group $C_{2j+1}(\mathbb{C}P^n)$ is itself the trivial group, so the map $d_{2j+1}$ originating from it must also be the zero map. Therefore, $d_k = 0$ for all $k \ge 1$.

With all boundary maps being zero, the formula for homology simplifies immensely:
- The kernel of $d_k$ is the entire domain, $\ker(d_k) = C_k(\mathbb{C}P^n)$.
- The image of $d_{k+1}$ is the [trivial group](@entry_id:151996), $\text{im}(d_{k+1}) = \{0\}$.

Thus, the homology groups are isomorphic to the chain groups themselves:
$$
H_k(\mathbb{C}P^n; \mathbb{Z}) \cong C_k(\mathbb{C}P^n; \mathbb{Z})
$$

This leads directly to the fundamental result for the homology of [complex projective space](@entry_id:268402):

$$
H_k(\mathbb{C}P^n; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \begin{cases} \mathbb{Z}  & \text{if } k \text{ is even and } 0 \le k \le 2n \\ \{0\} & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
$$

Let's illustrate this with a few low-dimensional examples.

-   **The Complex Projective Line, $\mathbb{C}P^1$:** The CW structure consists of one $0$-cell and one $2$-cell. The [chain complex](@entry_id:150246) is $C_2 \cong \mathbb{Z}$, $C_1 = \{0\}$, and $C_0 \cong \mathbb{Z}$. Since all boundary maps are zero, we immediately find $H_2(\mathbb{C}P^1) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, $H_1(\mathbb{C}P^1) = \{0\}$, and $H_0(\mathbb{C}P^1) \cong \mathbb{Z}$. This result is consistent with the well-known [homeomorphism](@entry_id:146933) $\mathbb{C}P^1 \cong S^2$, the 2-sphere, which has the same homology groups.

-   **The Complex Projective Plane, $\mathbb{C}P^2$:** This space has one cell in each of dimensions 0, 2, and 4. The cellular chain groups are $C_0 \cong \mathbb{Z}$, $C_2 \cong \mathbb{Z}$, $C_4 \cong \mathbb{Z}$, and all others are trivial. As all boundary maps are zero, the homology groups are identical to these chain groups. Thus, the homology groups are $(H_0, H_1, H_2, H_3, H_4) = (\mathbb{Z}, 0, \mathbb{Z}, 0, \mathbb{Z})$.

-   **The Complex Projective 3-Space, $\mathbb{C}P^3$:** Following the same pattern, $\mathbb{C}P^3$ has cells in dimensions 0, 2, 4, and 6. Its homology is non-trivial only in these dimensions, where it is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$.

A direct consequence of this structure is that the odd-dimensional homology groups of $\mathbb{C}P^n$ are always trivial. For any odd $k$, the cellular chain group $C_k(\mathbb{C}P^n)$ is zero, which immediately implies that $H_k(\mathbb{C}P^n)$ is also zero.

### Fundamental Group and Orientability

The calculation of the [first homology group](@entry_id:145318), $H_1(\mathbb{C}P^n)$, provides insight into the **fundamental group**, $\pi_1(\mathbb{C}P^n)$. For any [path-connected space](@entry_id:156428), the Hurewicz theorem states that $H_1(X; \mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of $\pi_1(X)$. Our calculation shows that for any $n \ge 1$, $H_1(\mathbb{C}P^n; \mathbb{Z}) = 0$. This implies that the fundamental group, if non-trivial, must be a [perfect group](@entry_id:145358) (a group equal to its own commutator subgroup). However, we can use the CW structure to show more. The 1-skeleton of $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is just the 0-cell $e^0$, which is a point and thus simply connected. The 2-skeleton is formed by [attaching a 2-cell](@entry_id:148354) to this point. Attaching cells of dimension 2 or higher to a [simply connected space](@entry_id:150573) cannot create a non-trivial fundamental group. Therefore, $\pi_1(\mathbb{C}P^n)$ is the [trivial group](@entry_id:151996) for all $n \ge 1$, meaning $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is **simply connected**.

Another important topological property is **orientability**. A compact, connected, $d$-dimensional manifold $M$ is orientable if and only if its top-dimensional homology group $H_d(M; \mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$. For $\mathbb{C}P^n$, which is a compact, connected manifold of real dimension $2n$, we have found that $H_{2n}(\mathbb{C}P^n; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}$. This confirms that $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is an [orientable manifold](@entry_id:276936) for all $n \ge 1$.

### An Inductive Approach via Relative Homology

While direct calculation using the simplified [cellular chain complex](@entry_id:160435) is effective, an inductive approach provides deeper insight into the structure of complex [projective spaces](@entry_id:157963). This method relies on viewing $\mathbb{C}P^n$ as an extension of $\mathbb{C}P^{n-1}$.

As noted in the description of the CW structure, $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is obtained from $\mathbb{C}P^{n-1}$ by attaching a single $2n$-cell. This gives rise to a **relative CW-pair** $(\mathbb{C}P^n, \mathbb{C}P^{n-1})$. A fundamental theorem states that if $(X, A)$ is a CW pair, the quotient space $X/A$ obtained by collapsing the subspace $A$ to a point is homotopy equivalent to the result of attaching the cells of $X \setminus A$ to a point. In our case, this gives the crucial [homeomorphism](@entry_id:146933):

$$
\mathbb{C}P^n / \mathbb{C}P^{n-1} \cong S^{2n}
$$

The homology of this quotient space is related to the **[relative homology](@entry_id:159348)** of the pair $(\mathbb{C}P^n, \mathbb{C}P^{n-1})$ by the isomorphism $H_k(X, A) \cong \tilde{H}_k(X/A)$, where $\tilde{H}_k$ denotes [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187). The [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187) of the $2n$-sphere $S^{2n}$ is $\mathbb{Z}$ for $k=2n$ and trivial otherwise. Consequently, the [relative homology groups](@entry_id:159711) are:

$$
H_k(\mathbb{C}P^n, \mathbb{C}P^{n-1}; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \begin{cases} \mathbb{Z} & \text{if } k=2n \\ \{0\} & \text{if } k \neq 2n \end{cases}
$$

This result is a key ingredient for the inductive argument. We now employ the **long exact sequence in homology** for the pair $(\mathbb{C}P^n, \mathbb{C}P^{n-1})$:

$$
\dots \to H_k(\mathbb{C}P^{n-1}) \xrightarrow{i_*} H_k(\mathbb{C}P^n) \xrightarrow{j_*} H_k(\mathbb{C}P^n, \mathbb{C}P^{n-1}) \xrightarrow{\partial} H_{k-1}(\mathbb{C}P^{n-1}) \to \dots
$$

Let's analyze this sequence. For $k  2n-1$, the adjacent [relative homology groups](@entry_id:159711) $H_{k+1}(\mathbb{C}P^n, \mathbb{C}P^{n-1})$ and $H_k(\mathbb{C}P^n, \mathbb{C}P^{n-1})$ are both zero. By exactness, the map $i_*: H_k(\mathbb{C}P^{n-1}) \to H_k(\mathbb{C}P^n)$ must be an isomorphism for $k  2n-1$. This tells us that the homology of $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is identical to that of $\mathbb{C}P^{n-1}$ in these low degrees.

Now, consider the segment of the sequence around the top dimension:

$$
\underbrace{H_{2n}(\mathbb{C}P^{n-1})}_{=0} \to H_{2n}(\mathbb{C}P^n) \to \underbrace{H_{2n}(\mathbb{C}P^n, \mathbb{C}P^{n-1})}_{\cong \mathbb{Z}} \to \underbrace{H_{2n-1}(\mathbb{C}P^{n-1})}_{=0 \text{ by induction}} \to \dots
$$

The group $H_{2n}(\mathbb{C}P^{n-1})$ is zero because $\mathbb{C}P^{n-1}$ is a $(2n-2)$-dimensional complex. The group $H_{2n-1}(\mathbb{C}P^{n-1})$ is zero by the [inductive hypothesis](@entry_id:139767) that odd-dimensional homology vanishes. The sequence thus reduces to a [short exact sequence](@entry_id:137930):

$$
0 \to H_{2n}(\mathbb{C}P^n) \to \mathbb{Z} \to 0
$$

This implies that $H_{2n}(\mathbb{C}P^n) \cong \mathbb{Z}$. Combining these facts, and starting with the [base case](@entry_id:146682) $\mathbb{C}P^0$ (a point with $H_0 \cong \mathbb{Z}$), this inductive argument rigorously re-establishes the complete homology of $\mathbb{C}P^n$.

### Invariants and Algebraic Structure

With the homology groups established, we can define important associated invariants. The **Betti numbers**, $b_k(X) = \text{rank}(H_k(X; \mathbb{Z}))$, for $\mathbb{C}P^n$ are clearly $b_k(\mathbb{C}P^n) = 1$ for even $k$ with $0 \le k \le 2n$, and $b_k = 0$ otherwise.

The **Poincaré polynomial**, $P_X(t) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} b_k(X) t^k$, is the [generating function](@entry_id:152704) for these Betti numbers. For $\mathbb{C}P^n$, this polynomial is:

$$
P_{\mathbb{C}P^n}(t) = \sum_{j=0}^{n} b_{2j}(\mathbb{C}P^n) t^{2j} = 1 + t^2 + t^4 + \dots + t^{2n}
$$

This is a finite geometric series, which has the [closed-form expression](@entry_id:267458):

$$
P_{\mathbb{C}P^n}(t) = \frac{1 - t^{2(n+1)}}{1 - t^2}
$$

This compact formula encapsulates the Betti numbers of complex [projective spaces](@entry_id:157963) of any dimension.

Furthermore, the inductive construction provides insight into the relationship between the **homology generators**. Let $\alpha_{n,k}$ denote a generator of the [infinite cyclic group](@entry_id:139160) $H_{2k}(\mathbb{C}P^n; \mathbb{Z})$. Consider the standard inclusion map $i: \mathbb{C}P^m \to \mathbb{C}P^n$ for $m  n$, which embeds $\mathbb{C}P^m$ as a subspace of $\mathbb{C}P^n$. This map induces a homomorphism on homology, $i_*: H_{2k}(\mathbb{C}P^m) \to H_{2k}(\mathbb{C}P^n)$. Since the inclusion map $i$ respects the cellular structure (i.e., it is a [cellular map](@entry_id:151769) that sends the $2k$-cell of $\mathbb{C}P^m$ to the $2k$-cell of $\mathbb{C}P^n$), the [induced map on homology](@entry_id:265781) sends the generator corresponding to that cell to the generator of the [target space](@entry_id:143180). Thus, for a suitable choice of generators, we have:

$$
i_*(\alpha_{m,k}) = \alpha_{n,k} \quad \text{for } 0 \le k \le m
$$

This [naturality](@entry_id:270302) is fundamental. It implies that the $2k$-dimensional hole in $\mathbb{C}P^m$ is precisely the same $2k$-dimensional hole that exists within the larger space $\mathbb{C}P^n$. This is a reflection of the stable nature of the [cohomology ring](@entry_id:160158) of [projective spaces](@entry_id:157963).

### An Alternative Approach: The Gysin Sequence

A more advanced but equally powerful method for calculating the homology of $\mathbb{C}P^n$ involves the **Hopf [fibration](@entry_id:162085)**. This is a principal circle bundle $\pi: S^{2n+1} \to \mathbb{C}P^n$, where the total space is the $(2n+1)$-sphere and the fiber over each point is a circle $S^1$. Associated with such an oriented sphere bundle is a long exact sequence in homology known as the **Gysin sequence**. For the Hopf [fibration](@entry_id:162085), it takes the form:

$$
\dots \to H_k(S^{2n+1}) \xrightarrow{\pi_*} H_k(\mathbb{C}P^n) \xrightarrow{\frown e} H_{k-2}(\mathbb{C}P^n) \xrightarrow{\delta} H_{k-1}(S^{2n+1}) \to \dots
$$

Here, the map $\frown e$ represents the [cap product](@entry_id:158725) with the Euler class of the bundle. By analyzing this sequence, one can inductively determine the homology of $\mathbb{C}P^n$.

For $2  k  2n+1$, the homology groups of the sphere, $H_k(S^{2n+1})$ and $H_{k-1}(S^{2n+1})$, are both trivial. The Gysin sequence then yields a [short exact sequence](@entry_id:137930) $0 \to H_k(\mathbb{C}P^n) \to H_{k-2}(\mathbb{C}P^n) \to 0$, implying that the [cap product](@entry_id:158725) map is an [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127):

$$
\frown e: H_k(\mathbb{C}P^n) \cong H_{k-2}(\mathbb{C}P^n) \quad \text{for } 2  k  2n+1
$$

Starting with the known facts that $H_0(\mathbb{C}P^n) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ ([path-connectedness](@entry_id:142695)) and $H_1(\mathbb{C}P^n) = 0$ ([simple connectivity](@entry_id:189103)), this isomorphism allows one to recursively compute all the homology groups. For instance, $H_2(\mathbb{C}P^n)$ can be shown to be $\mathbb{Z}$ by examining the sequence at $k=2$. Then, the isomorphism implies $H_4(\mathbb{C}P^n) \cong H_2(\mathbb{C}P^n) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, $H_6(\mathbb{C}P^n) \cong H_4(\mathbb{C}P^n) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, and so on. Similarly, it shows all odd-dimensional homology groups up to $2n-1$ are trivial. A careful analysis of the sequence at its endpoints confirms $H_{2n}(\mathbb{C}P^n) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ as well. This alternative derivation not only confirms our previous result but also highlights the deep geometric structure of [complex projective space](@entry_id:268402) as the base of the Hopf fibration.
