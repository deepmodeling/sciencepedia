The proposition is true only if the metric space $X$ is also assumed to be complete.", "solution": "We evaluate the proposition: If every continuous function $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is bounded, then $X$ is sequentially compact.\n\nFirst, we prove the implication by contrapositive. Assume $X$ is not sequentially compact. Then there exists a sequence $(x_{n})$ in $X$ with no convergent subsequence. In a metric space, if the set $A=\\{x_{n} : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ had a limit point $p \\in X$, then by first countability one could construct a subsequence converging to $p$: for each $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, choose $n_{k}  n_{k-1}$ such that $d(x_{n_{k}},p)  \\frac{1}{k}$, which yields $x_{n_{k}} \\to p$. This contradicts the choice of $(x_{n})$. Hence $A$ has no limit point in $X$.\n\nSince $A$ is infinite with no limit point, it is closed and discrete in the metric space $X$. For each $a \\in A$, define\n$$\nr(a) \\coloneqq \\frac{1}{2}\\inf\\{d(a,b) : b \\in A,\\, b \\neq a\\}  0,\n$$\nso that the open balls $B(a,r(a))$ are pairwise disjoint.

Because the supports are pairwise disjoint, at each $x \\in X$ at most one $h_{a}(x)$ is nonzero. Enumerate $A=\\{a_{n}\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ and define\n$$\nf(x) \\coloneqq \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n\\, h_{a_{n}}(x).\n$$\nThis sum is pointwise finite (at most one nonzero term), hence defines a continuous function on $X$. Moreover, $f(a_{n})=n$, so $f$ is unbounded. This contradicts the hypothesis that every continuous $\\mathbb{R}$-valued function on $X$ is bounded. Therefore, $X$ must be sequentially compact.\n\nNext, we show the converse: if $X$ is sequentially compact, then every continuous $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is bounded. The continuous image of a sequentially compact space is sequentially compact: given any sequence $(y_{n})$ in $f(X)$, choose $x_{n} \\in X$ with $f(x_{n})=y_{n}$; then a subsequence $x_{n_{k}}$ converges in $X$, and continuity yields $y_{n_{k}}=f(x_{n_{k}})$ converging in $f(X)$. Hence $f(X)$ is sequentially compact in $\\mathbb{R}$. A sequentially compact subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ is bounded: if it were unbounded, one could select a sequence $(z_{n})$ with $|z_{n}| \\geq n$, which has no convergent subsequence, a contradiction. Thus $f(X)$ is bounded, and so $f$ is bounded.\n\nTherefore, in metric spaces, the property that all real-valued continuous functions are bounded is equivalent to sequential compactness. Option A is correct. Options B and C propose counterexamples where the hypothesis fails because unbounded continuous functions exist: for an infinite discrete space every function is continuous, so unbounded functions exist; for $(\\mathbb{Q},|\\cdot|)$ the identity map is continuous and unbounded.
