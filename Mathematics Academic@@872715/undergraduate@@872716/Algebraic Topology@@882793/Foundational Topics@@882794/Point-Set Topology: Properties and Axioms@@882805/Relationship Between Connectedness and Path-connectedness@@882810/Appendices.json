Consequently, $X$ cannot be path-connected because any path from a point of $B$ to a point of $A\\cup C$ would, up to the first time it hits $x=1$, give a path in $B\\cup C$ from a point of $B$ to a point of $C$, which is impossible.\n- Proof of the standard fact: Suppose $p: [0,1] \\to B \\cup C$ is continuous with $p(0)\\in C$ and $p(1)\\in B$. Let $f = \\pi_x \\circ p$, where $\\pi_x$ is projection onto the $x$-coordinate. Then $f$ is continuous, $f([0,1]) \\subset [1,\\infty)$, $f(0)=1$, and $f(1)>1$.

Then $f(t_0)=1$ and, for all $t>t_0$ close enough to $t_0$, we have $f(t)>1$ and $p(t) \\in B$, so writing $y = \\pi_y \\circ p$, we have\n$$\ny(t)=\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{f(t)-1}\\right).\n$$\nBy continuity of $f$ at $t_0$, $f(t) \\to 1^+$ as $t \\downarrow t_0$, but $\\sin(1/(x-1))$ has no limit as $x \\to 1^+$.

The key is to understand the nature of $X$ by investigating the function that defines it.\n\nFirst, let's define a function $F: [-1, 1] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ as follows:\n$$\nF(x) = \\begin{cases}\nx \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)  \\text{if } x \\in [-1, 1] \\setminus \\{0\\} \\\\\n0  \\text{if } x = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe space $X$ is precisely the graph of this function, i.e., $X = \\{ (x, F(x)) \\mid x \\in [-1, 1] \\}$.\n\nLet's check the continuity of $F(x)$ at $x=0$. We evaluate the limit of $F(x)$ as $x \\to 0$.\nFor $x \\neq 0$, we know that $-1 \\le \\sin(1/x) \\le 1$. Multiplying by $|x|$ (which is positive), we get:\n$$ -|x| \\le |x| \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\le |x| $$\nThis is equivalent to $-|x| \\le x \\sin(1/x) \\le |x|$ for $x \\neq 0$.\nBy the Squeeze Theorem, since $\\lim_{x\\to 0} (-|x|) = 0$ and $\\lim_{x\\to 0} |x| = 0$, we have:\n$$ \\lim_{x\\to 0} x \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 $$\nThis limit matches the value we assigned to $F(0)$, so $F(0) = 0 = \\lim_{x\\to 0} F(x)$. Therefore, the function $F(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$. Since $x$ and $\\sin(1/x)$ are continuous for $x \\neq 0$, $F(x)$ is continuous on the entire interval $[-1, 1]$.\n\nNow, consider the map $h: [-1, 1] \\to X$ defined by $h(t) = (t, F(t))$.\nThe component functions of $h$ are $t$ (the identity function) and $F(t)$. Both are continuous on $[-1, 1]$. Thus, $h$ is a continuous map.\nThe inverse of this map is the projection map $p: X \\to [-1, 1]$ defined by $p(x, y) = x$. This map is the restriction of the continuous projection map from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, so it is also continuous.\nSince $h$ is a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse, it is a homeomorphism between the interval $[-1, 1]$ and the space $X$.\n\nWe can now evaluate each statement using the fact that $X$ is homeomorphic to $[-1, 1]$. Topological properties are preserved under homeomorphism.\n\nA. **$X$ is a compact space.** The interval $[-1, 1]$ is a closed and bounded subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, so by the Heine-Borel theorem, it is compact. Since compactness is a topological property, and $X$ is homeomorphic to a compact space, $X$ is also compact. Thus, statement A is true.\n\nB. **$X$ is a path-connected space.** The interval $[-1, 1]$ is path-connected. Since path-connectedness is a topological property, $X$ is also path-connected. Alternatively, the continuous image of a path-connected space is path-connected, and $X = h([-1,1])$. Thus, statement B is true.\n\nC. **$X$ is a locally connected space.** The interval $[-1, 1]$ is locally connected. Since local connectedness is a topological property, $X$ must also be locally connected. Thus, statement C is true.\n\nE. **The fundamental group of $X$ is trivial.** The interval $[-1, 1]$ is a convex subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, so it is contractible (it has a deformation retraction to any of its points). A contractible space is simply connected, which means its fundamental group is trivial. Since $X$ is homeomorphic to $[-1,1]$, it is also contractible and simply connected. Therefore, its fundamental group $\\pi_1(X, (0,0))$ is the trivial group $\\{e\\}$. Thus, statement E is true.\n\nD. **$X$ is a differentiable 1-manifold.** For $X$ to be a differentiable 1-manifold, the parameterization given by $h(t) = (t, F(t))$ must be at least of class $C^1$ (i.e., $F(t)$ must be continuously differentiable) and its derivative vector $h'(t) = (1, F'(t))$ must be non-zero everywhere. Let's check if $F(t)$ is differentiable at $t=0$. We compute the derivative from its definition:\n$$ F'(0) = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{F(t) - F(0)}{t - 0} = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{t \\sin(1/t) - 0}{t} = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{t}\\right) $$\nThis limit does not exist because as $t \\to 0$, $1/t$ goes to infinity, and $\\sin(1/t)$ oscillates infinitely often between $-1$ and $1$. Since $F(t)$ is not differentiable at $t=0$, the curve $X$ is not smooth at the origin $(0,0)$ and does not possess a well-defined tangent vector there. Therefore, $X$ is not a differentiable 1-manifold. Thus, statement D is false.\n\nSince statements A, B, C, and E are true, the only false statement is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1669294"}, {"introduction": "This problem challenges you to apply topological concepts to a different mathematical domain: linear algebra.

This means that $b$ and $c$ must be non-zero and have opposite signs.\nThis observation partitions the subspace $S$ into two disjoint, non-empty subsets:\n1. $S_1 = \\{ A \\in S \\mid b > 0 \\text{ and } c  0 \\}$\n2. $S_2 = \\{ A \\in S \\mid b  0 \\text{ and } c > 0 \\}$\n\nFor example, $A_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$ has $(0-0)^2 + 4(1)(-1) = -4  0$, so $A_1 \\in S_1$.

Both sets are non-empty.\n\nNext, we check if $S_1$ and $S_2$ are path-connected.\nLet's show that any matrix $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\\\ c  d \\end{pmatrix} \\in S_1$ is path-connected to the specific matrix $C_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nA path can be constructed in two stages.\n\nStage 1: Connect $A$ to $A' = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  b \\\\ c  0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nDefine a path $\\gamma_1(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} (1-t)a  b \\\\ c  (1-t)d \\end{pmatrix}$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\nFor any $t \\in [0,1]$, the off-diagonal elements are constant, so $b>0$ and $c0$. We must check if the inequality holds:\n$$\n((1-t)a - (1-t)d)^2 + 4bc = (1-t)^2(a-d)^2 + 4bc  0\n$$\nSince $A \\in S_1$, we know $(a-d)^2 + 4bc  0$, which implies $(a-d)^2  -4bc$.\nAs $(1-t)^2 \\le 1$ for $t \\in [0,1]$, we have $(1-t)^2(a-d)^2 \\le (a-d)^2  -4bc$.\nTherefore, $(1-t)^2(a-d)^2 + 4bc  -4bc + 4bc = 0$. The path $\\gamma_1(t)$ lies entirely within $S_1$.\n\nStage 2: Connect $A' = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  b \\\\ c  0 \\end{pmatrix}$ to $C_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nDefine a path $\\gamma_2(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  (1-t)b + t \\\\ (1-t)c - t  0 \\end{pmatrix}$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\nThe diagonal elements are zero. Let $b(t) = (1-t)b+t$ and $c(t) = (1-t)c-t$.\nSince $b>0$, $b(t)$ is a convex combination of positive numbers ($b$ and $1$) and is thus positive for all $t \\in [0,1]$.\nSince $c0$, $c(t)$ is a convex combination of negative numbers ($c$ and $-1$) and is thus negative for all $t \\in [0,1]$.\nThe inequality condition is $(0-0)^2 + 4b(t)c(t)  0$. This simplifies to $b(t)c(t)  0$, which is true since $b(t)>0$ and $c(t)0$. The path $\\gamma_2(t)$ also lies entirely within $S_1$.\n\nBy concatenating these two paths, we can connect any matrix in $S_1$ to the matrix $C_1$. Since path-connectedness is an equivalence relation, any two matrices in $S_1$ are path-connected. Thus, $S_1$ is a path-connected set.\nA completely symmetric argument shows that any matrix in $S_2$ is path-connected to $C_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, and therefore $S_2$ is also path-connected.\n\nFinally, we must show that there is no path between $S_1$ and $S_2$.\nLet $\\gamma(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} a(t)  b(t) \\\\ c(t)  d(t) \\end{pmatrix}$ be a continuous path in $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$ for $t \\in [0,1]$, such that $\\gamma(0) \\in S_1$ and $\\gamma(1) \\in S_2$.\nBy definition of $S_1$ and $S_2$:\n- At $t=0$, $b(0) > 0$.\n- At $t=1$, $b(1)  0$.\nThe function $b(t)$ is continuous. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist some $t_0 \\in (0,1)$ such that $b(t_0) = 0$.\nFor the path to be in $S$, the condition $(a(t)-d(t))^2 + 4b(t)c(t)  0$ must hold for all $t \\in [0,1]$.\nAt $t=t_0$, this condition becomes:\n$$\n(a(t_0)-d(t_0))^2 + 4(0)c(t_0)  0\n$$\n$$\n(a(t_0)-d(t_0))^2  0\n$$\nThis is a contradiction, as the square of a real number cannot be negative.\nTherefore, no continuous path can connect a point in $S_1$ to a point in $S_2$.\nThe subspace $S$ is the disjoint union of two path-connected sets, $S_1$ and $S_2$. These are the path-components of $S$.\nThus, there are 2 path-components.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1669251"}]}
