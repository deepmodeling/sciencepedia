Consider the open cover $\\mathcal{U}=\\{[x,x+1): x\\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$. It covers $\\mathbb{R}$ because for any $t\\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $t\\in [t,t+1)$. Suppose finitely many members $\\{[x_{i},x_{i}+1)\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ cover $\\mathbb{R}$. Let $m=\\min\\{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\}$. Then any $tm$ is not in $\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}[x_{i},x_{i}+1)$, a contradiction. Hence there is no finite subcover, so $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$ is not compact. Therefore A is false.\n\nStatement B. First, $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$ is separable: $\\mathbb{Q}$ is dense because every basic open set $[a,b)$ contains some rational $q$ with $a\\le qb$. In metric spaces, separability implies second countability (given a countable dense set $D$ and rational radii, $\\{B(d,r): d\\in D, r\\in \\mathbb{Q}^{+}\\}$ is a countable base). We show $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$ is not second countable: the family $\\{[x,x+1): x\\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$ is an uncountable collection of pairwise disjoint non-empty open sets. In any second countable space, every family of pairwise disjoint non-empty open sets is countable (each such open set contains a distinct basis element from a countable base), so $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$ cannot be second countable. Therefore $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$ cannot be metrizable. Hence B is false.\n\nStatement C. Let $I=\\mathbb{R}\\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$ be the set of irrationals. For any $x\\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and any basic neighborhood $[x,x+\\epsilon)$, there exists an irrational in $[x,x+\\epsilon)$, so every rational lies in the closure of $I$. Thus $\\overline{I}=\\mathbb{R}$, so $I$ is not closed. Hence C is false.\n\nStatement D. We prove $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$ is normal. Let $F$ and $G$ be disjoint closed subsets of $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$. For $x\\in \\mathbb{R}$ and a set $H\\subset \\mathbb{R}$, define\n$$\n\\rho_{H}(x)=\\sup\\{t\\ge 0: [x,x+t)\\cap H=\\emptyset\\}.\n$$\nBecause $H$ is closed and $x\\notin H$ iff there exists some basic neighborhood $[x,x+\\epsilon)$ disjoint from $H$, we have $\\rho_{H}(x)0$ for all $x\\notin H$, and $\\rho_{H}(x)=0$ for $x\\in H$. Now define\n$$\nU=\\bigcup_{x\\in F}[x,x+\\rho_{G}(x)),\\qquad V=\\bigcup_{y\\in G}[y,y+\\rho_{F}(y)).\n$$\nEach $[x,x+\\rho_{G}(x))$ is open and disjoint from $G$ by construction, so $U$ is open with $F\\subset U$ and $U\\cap G=\\emptyset$. Similarly, $V$ is open with $G\\subset V$ and $V\\cap F=\\emptyset$. We claim $U\\cap V=\\emptyset$. Suppose $z\\in U\\cap V$. Then there exist $x\\in F$ and $y\\in G$ such that $z\\in [x,x+\\rho_{G}(x))$ and $z\\in [y,y+\\rho_{F}(y))$. Consider the cases:\n- If $x\\le y$, then $y\\le zx+\\rho_{G}(x)$, so $y\\in [x,x+\\rho_{G}(x))$, contradicting that $[x,x+\\rho_{G}(x))\\cap G=\\emptyset$.\n- If $y\\le x$, then $x\\le zy+\\rho_{F}(y)$, so $x\\in [y,y+\\rho_{F}(y))$, contradicting that $[y,y+\\rho_{F}(y))\\cap F=\\emptyset$.\nThus $U\\cap V=\\emptyset$, proving normality. Therefore D is true.\n\nStatement E. The product $\\mathbb{R}_{l}\\times \\mathbb{R}_{l}$ (the Sorgenfrey plane) is not normal. A classical construction shows this: let $\\Delta=\\{(x,-x): x\\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$ be the anti-diagonal.

Partition $\\Delta$ into disjoint subsets $A=\\{(x,-x): x\\in \\mathbb{Q}\\}$ and $B=\\{(x,-x): x\\in \\mathbb{R}\\setminus \\mathbb{Q}\\}$. Since $\\Delta$ is closed and discrete, both $A$ and $B$ are closed in the plane. It is a standard result that these disjoint closed sets cannot be separated by disjoint open sets in the Sorgenfrey plane, so the plane is not normal.

The classical result is that this is impossible; this is the standard proof that the Sorgenfrey plane is not normal. The geometric reason is tied to the nature of basic neighborhoods in $\\mathbb{R}_{l}^{2}$: for any $(x,-x)$, a basic open rectangle $[x, x+\\alpha)\\times[-x, -x+\\beta)$ extends only to the northeast from the point $(x,-x)$. If we attempt to assign to each rational $q$ such a northeast rectangle contained in an open $U$ and to each irrational $r$ such a northeast rectangle contained in an open $V$, then because rationals and irrationals are both dense in $\\mathbb{R}$ and because every such rectangle from a point on $L$ moves northeast, one cannot keep the unions of these two families disjoint. Intuitively, any open set that covers all rational anti-diagonal points must, via these northeast extensions, intrude into any open set that covers all irrational anti-diagonal points, and vice versa.

Moreover, even the general claim “the product of two normal spaces is always normal” is false. The reasoning is incorrect.\n\nD. This captures the correct mechanism: because of the density of $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\mathbb{Q}$ and the shape of basic open rectangles in $\\mathbb{R}_{l}^{2}$, any open set covering $A$ and any open set covering $B$ must intersect, showing that $A$ and $B$ cannot be separated by disjoint open sets.
