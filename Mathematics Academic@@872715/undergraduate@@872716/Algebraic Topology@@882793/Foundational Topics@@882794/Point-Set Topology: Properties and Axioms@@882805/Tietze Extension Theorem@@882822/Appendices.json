We analyze each statement.\n\nTo show existence of a continuous extension to $[0,1]$, define\n$$\nF(x)=(1-x)y_{0}+x y_{1}.\n$$\nSince $x\\mapsto x$ and $x\\mapsto 1-x$ are continuous on $[0,1]$, and linear combinations with real coefficients preserve continuity, $F$ is continuous on $[0,1]$. Evaluate the endpoints:\n$$\nF(0)=(1-0)y_{0}+0\\cdot y_{1}=y_{0},\\quad F(1)=(1-1)y_{0}+1\\cdot y_{1}=y_{1}.\n$$\nThus a continuous extension exists for all $y_{0},y_{1}\\in\\mathbb{R}$.

This is false because we can take the codomain to be $\\mathbb{R}$ and the above $F$ is a valid continuous function $F:[0,1]\\to\\mathbb{R}$. No restriction of the codomain is required for existence.

The Tietze Extension Theorem requires the domain $X$ to be non-compact, but the disk $D^2$ is compact.", "solution": "We analyze the setting and the Tietze Extension Theorem carefully.\n\nFirst, $D^2$ is a compact metric space, hence normal. Therefore, the hypothesis that the domain $X$ be normal is satisfied. Next, $S^1 \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and since $S^1 = D^2 \\cap S^1$, it is closed in the subspace $D^2$. Thus the hypothesis that $A$ be a closed subspace of $X$ is also satisfied. The identity map $f:S^1\\to S^1$ is continuous, so continuity is not an issue.\n\nThe classical reason there is no extension $F:D^2 \\to S^1$ with $F|_{S^1}=\\operatorname{id}_{S^1}$ is the fundamental group obstruction. Let $i:S^1 \\hookrightarrow D^2$ denote the inclusion. If such $F$ existed, then on fundamental groups,\n$$(\\operatorname{id}_{S^{1}})_{*}=f_{*}=(F\\circ i)_{*}=F_{*}\\circ i_{*}.$$\nBut $\\pi_{1}(D^2)=0$, so $i_{*}:\\pi_{1}(S^1)\\to \\pi_{1}(D^2)$ is the trivial homomorphism, hence $F_{*}\\circ i_{*}$ is trivial. This contradicts that $(\\operatorname{id}_{S^{1}})_{*}$ is the identity on $\\pi_{1}(S^1)\\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, which is nontrivial. Therefore, no such extension exists.\n\nThis nonexistence does not contradict the Tietze Extension Theorem because that theorem applies to maps whose codomain is $\\mathbb{R}^{k}$ (or more generally a Banach space), not to arbitrary target spaces. Here the target of $f$ is $S^1$, which is not homeomorphic to any $\\mathbb{R}^{k}$. Indeed, if we consider the inclusion $j:S^1 \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2$ and the composite $j\\circ f:S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$, the Tietze theorem guarantees an extension $G:D^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ of $j\\circ f$, but there is no requirement that $G$ take values in $S^1$. Requiring the image to lie in $S^1$ would contradict the fundamental group argument above. Thus, the correct explanation is that the theorem does not apply because the codomain is $S^1$ rather than $\\mathbb{R}^{k}$.\n\nTherefore:\n- A is false because $D^2$ is normal.\n- B is false because $S^1$ is closed in $D^2$.\n- C is true: the codomain $S^1$ is not $\\mathbb{R}^k$.\n- D is false because $f$ is continuous.\n- E is false because the theorem does not require non-compactness, and compact metric spaces are normal.\n\nHence the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1676240"}]}
