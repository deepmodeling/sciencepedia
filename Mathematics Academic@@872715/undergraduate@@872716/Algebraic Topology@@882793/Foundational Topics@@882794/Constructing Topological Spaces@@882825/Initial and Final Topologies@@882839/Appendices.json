We will do this by comparing it with the standard topology $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$.\n\n**Part 1: Show that $\\mathcal{T}_{std} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_{F}$**\nLet $U$ be an arbitrary open set in the standard topology, i.e., $U \\in \\mathcal{T}_{std}$. We need to check if $U$ is also in $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$. According to the definition of $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$, this is true if $p^{-1}(U)$ is open in $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$ for every polynomial $p \\in \\mathcal{P}$.\n\nAny real polynomial function $p: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function when both the domain and codomain are equipped with the standard topology $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$. By the topological definition of continuity, a function is continuous if the preimage of every open set in the codomain is an open set in the domain.\nSince $p: (\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_{std}) \\to (\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_{std})$ is continuous and $U$ is an open set in the codomain's topology $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$, its preimage $p^{-1}(U)$ must be an open set in the domain's topology $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$.\nThis holds for any polynomial $p \\in \\mathcal{P}$. Therefore, by the definition of the final topology, $U$ must be an open set in $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$.\nSince this is true for any $U \\in \\mathcal{T}_{std}$, we have shown that $\\mathcal{T}_{std} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_{F}$.\n\n**Part 2: Show that $\\mathcal{T}_{F} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_{std}$**\nLet $V$ be an arbitrary open set in the final topology, i.e., $V \\in \\mathcal{T}_{F}$. By definition, this means that $p^{-1}(V)$ is open in $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$ for *all* polynomials $p \\in \\mathcal{P}$.\n\nThe family of polynomials $\\mathcal{P}$ is very large. We can choose a specific, simple polynomial from this family to gain insight. Let's consider the identity polynomial, $p(x) = x$. This is a polynomial of degree one, so it belongs to $\\mathcal{P}$.\nFor this particular choice of $p$, the preimage of the set $V$ is:\n$$p^{-1}(V) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid p(x) \\in V\\} = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid x \\in V\\} = V$$\nSince $V$ is in $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$, we know that its preimage under *any* polynomial, including our chosen $p(x)=x$, must be open in $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$. Thus, we must have $p^{-1}(V) \\in \\mathcal{T}_{std}$.\nAs we just showed $p^{-1}(V) = V$, it follows directly that $V \\in \\mathcal{T}_{std}$.\nSince this holds for any $V \\in \\mathcal{T}_{F}$, we have shown that $\\mathcal{T}_{F} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_{std}$.\n\n**Part 3: Conclude the identity of $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$**\nFrom Part 1 ($\\mathcal{T}_{std} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_{F}$) and Part 2 ($\\mathcal{T}_{F} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_{std}$), we can conclude that the final topology $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$ is identical to the standard topology $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$.\n$$ \\mathcal{T}_{F} = \\mathcal{T}_{std} $$\n\n**Part 4: Compare $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$ with $\\mathcal{T}_{C}$**\nNow we compare $\\mathcal{T}_{F} = \\mathcal{T}_{std}$ with the cofinite topology $\\mathcal{T}_{C}$.\n\nFirst, let's check if $\\mathcal{T}_{C} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_{F}$. Let $W$ be an open set in the cofinite topology $\\mathcal{T}_{C}$. If $W = \\emptyset$, it is also in $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$ (since the empty set is in every topology). If $W \\neq \\emptyset$, its complement $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus W$ is a finite set, say $\\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\\}$. In the standard topology $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$, any finite set is a closed set. Therefore, $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus W$ is closed in $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$. The complement of a closed set is open, so $W$ is open in $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$. Since $\\mathcal{T}_{F} = \\mathcal{T}_{std}$, this means $W$ is open in $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$. Thus, every open set in $\\mathcal{T}_{C}$ is also open in $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$, which means $\\mathcal{T}_{C} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_{F}$.\n\nNext, we check if the inclusion is strict, i.e., if $\\mathcal{T}_{F} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_{C}$ is false. To do this, we need to find a set that is in $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$ but not in $\\mathcal{T}_{C}$.\nConsider the open interval $U = (0, 1)$. This is a standard example of an open set in $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$. Since $\\mathcal{T}_{F} = \\mathcal{T}_{std}$, we have $U \\in \\mathcal{T}_{F}$.\nNow, let's check if $U$ is in $\\mathcal{T}_{C}$. A set is open in $\\mathcal{T}_{C}$ if its complement is finite. The complement of $U$ is $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus (0, 1) = (-\\infty, 0] \\cup [1, \\infty)$. This set is clearly infinite. Therefore, by the definition of the cofinite topology, $U = (0,1)$ is not an open set in $\\mathcal{T}_{C}$.\n\nWe have found a set $U=(0,1)$ such that $U \\in \\mathcal{T}_{F}$ but $U \\notin \\mathcal{T}_{C}$. This proves that the inclusion is strict.\n\nCombining our findings, we have $\\mathcal{T}_{C} \\subsetneq \\mathcal{T}_{F}$.

We will analyze each property one by one.\n\nFor clarity, we identify each $X_n$ with its image $\\iota_n(X_n)$ in $X$. By the definition of the disjoint union topology, each set $X_n$ is an open subset of $X$.\n\n**P1: Compactness**\nA topological space is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover. Let's consider the collection of sets $\\mathcal{C} = \\{X_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$. As established, each $X_n$ is an open set in $X$. The union of all sets in $\\mathcal{C}$ is $\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty X_n = X$. Thus, $\\mathcal{C}$ is an open cover of $X$.\nThis cover is infinite, as it is indexed by the natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$. To form a subcover, we must select some of these sets. If we take any finite subcollection of $\\mathcal{C}$, say $\\{X_{n_1}, X_{n_2}, \\dots, X_{n_k}\\}$, its union is $\\bigcup_{i=1}^k X_{n_i}$. Since the family $\\{X_n\\}$ is a disjoint union and each $X_n$ is non-empty, this finite union cannot be equal to the entire space $X$, which is an infinite union of such sets. For example, any $x \\in X_m$ with $m \\notin \\{n_1, \\dots, n_k\\}$ will not be in the union. Therefore, no finite subcollection of $\\mathcal{C}$ can cover $X$. We have found an open cover with no finite subcover, so $X$ is not compact.\n\n**P2: Connectedness**\nA topological space is connected if it cannot be expressed as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. Consider the set $X_1$. It is non-empty. By the definition of the disjoint union topology, $X_1$ is an open subset of $X$.\nNow consider the complement of $X_1$ in $X$, which is $X_1^c = \\bigcup_{n=2}^\\infty X_n$. This set is a union of open sets ($X_2, X_3, \\dots$), and therefore is itself an open set.\nSo we have written $X = X_1 \\cup X_1^c$, where both $X_1$ and $X_1^c$ are non-empty and open, and they are disjoint by definition. This means $X_1$ is a proper non-empty clopen (closed and open) subset of $X$. The existence of such a subset implies that $X$ is disconnected.\n\n**P3: Local Compactness**\nA space is locally compact if every point has a compact neighborhood. Let's test this property for an arbitrary point $x \\in X$.\nAny point $x \\in X$ must belong to exactly one of the component spaces, say $X_k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $X$ is locally compact. Then, for the point $x \\in X_k$, there must exist a compact neighborhood $K$ of $x$ in $X$.\nSince $K$ is a neighborhood of $x$, it contains an open set $U$ such that $x \\in U \\subseteq K$.\nNow consider the set $K_k = K \\cap X_k$. Since $X_k$ is a closed set in $X$ (its complement is the open set $\\bigcup_{n \\neq k} X_n$), the intersection of the compact set $K$ with the closed set $X_k$ must be compact. So, $K_k$ is a compact set in the subspace topology of $X_k$.\nFurthermore, since $U$ is an open neighborhood of $x$ in $X$ and $U \\subseteq K$, the set $U_k = U \\cap X_k$ is an open neighborhood of $x$ in the subspace $X_k$. We have $x \\in U_k \\subseteq K_k$, which means $K_k$ is a neighborhood of $x$ within the space $X_k$.\nSo, if $X$ were locally compact, it would imply that any point $x \\in X_k$ has a compact neighborhood $K_k$ within the space $X_k$.\nHowever, the space $X_k$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{Q}$ with its standard topology. It is a well-known result that $\\mathbb{Q}$ is not a locally compact space. No point in $\\mathbb{Q}$ has a compact neighborhood. (Any neighborhood of a rational number $q$ in $\\mathbb{Q}$ must contain an interval $(q-\\epsilon, q+\\epsilon) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$. A compact subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ must be closed and bounded. The closure of $(q-\\epsilon, q+\\epsilon) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ is the interval $[q-\\epsilon, q+\\epsilon]$, which contains irrational numbers. Thus, no neighborhood of $q$ in $\\mathbb{Q}$ can be a closed subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ unless it is a singleton, which is not a neighborhood. Hence no neighborhood is compact.)\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption was false, and $X$ is not locally compact.\n\n**P4: Hausdorff Property**\nA space is Hausdorff (or $T_2$) if for any two distinct points $x, y \\in X$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $x \\in U$ and $y \\in V$.\nLet $x, y$ be two distinct points in $X$. We consider two cases:\nCase 1: The points $x$ and $y$ belong to the same component space. Let $x, y \\in X_k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The space $X_k$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is a subspace of the Hausdorff space $\\mathbb{R}$. Any subspace of a Hausdorff space is Hausdorff. Therefore, $X_k$ is Hausdorff. This means there exist disjoint sets $U_k, V_k$ that are open in $X_k$ such that $x \\in U_k$ and $y \\in V_k$. By the definition of the disjoint union topology, $U_k$ and $V_k$ are also open sets in the larger space $X$. Since they are disjoint in $X_k$, they are also disjoint in $X$. Thus, we have found separating open sets for $x$ and $y$.\nCase 2: The points $x$ and $y$ belong to different component spaces. Let $x \\in X_k$ and $y \\in X_m$ for $k \\neq m$. The sets $X_k$ and $X_m$ are themselves open in $X$. By definition of the disjoint union, $X_k \\cap X_m = \\emptyset$. We have $x \\in X_k$ and $y \\in X_m$. Thus, $X_k$ and $X_m$ are disjoint open neighborhoods of $x$ and $y$, respectively.\n\nIn both cases, any two distinct points in $X$ can be separated by disjoint open sets. Therefore, $X$ is a Hausdorff space.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- P1 (Compact): False\n- P2 (Connected): False\n- P3 (Locally Compact): False\n- P4 (Hausdorff): True\n\nThe only property from the list that the space $X$ possesses is P4. Therefore, the correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1658547"}]}
