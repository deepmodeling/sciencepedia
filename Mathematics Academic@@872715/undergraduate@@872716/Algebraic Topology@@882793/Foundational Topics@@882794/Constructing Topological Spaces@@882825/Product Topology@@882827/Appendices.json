Working through this problem is an excellent way to solidify your understanding of the definition of continuity by checking the condition on the basis elements of the product topology [@problem_id:1667035].", "problem": "Let $X$ be an arbitrary topological space, and let $X \\times X$ be the product space endowed with the product topology.

The map $\\Delta$ is always a continuous map.\n\nE. The map $\\Delta$ is continuous if and only if $X$ has the discrete topology.", "solution": "We analyze the diagonal map $\\Delta:X\\to X\\times X$ defined by $\\Delta(x)=(x,x)$ under the product topology on $X\\times X$ whose basis consists of sets $U\\times V$ with $U,V$ open in $X$.\n\nFirst, we test continuity of $\\Delta$. It suffices to compute the preimage of a basic open set. Let $U,V\\subseteq X$ be open. Then\n$$\n\\Delta^{-1}(U\\times V)=\\{x\\in X:(x,x)\\in U\\times V\\}=\\{x\\in X:x\\in U\\text{ and }x\\in V\\}=U\\cap V,\n$$\nwhich is open in $X$. Since arbitrary unions of such basic sets generate the topology on $X\\times X$, and preimages preserve unions and finite intersections, it follows that $\\Delta$ is continuous for every topological space $X$. Therefore, statement D is true.\n\nNext, we show that $\\Delta$ need not be an open map. If $X$ is not discrete, choose a nonempty open $U\\subseteq X$. Suppose, towards a contradiction, that $\\Delta(U)$ is open in $X\\times X$. Fix $x\\in U$. Then there exist open sets $A,B\\subseteq X$ with $x\\in A\\cap B$ and\n$$\nA\\times B\\subseteq \\Delta(U)\\subseteq \\Delta(X)=\\{(y,y):y\\in X\\}.\n$$\nFor any $a\\in A$ and $b\\in B$, we must have $(a,b)\\in A\\times B\\subseteq \\Delta(X)$, hence $a=b$. This forces that $A$ and $B$ can contain at most one point each and must in fact satisfy $A=B=\\{x\\}$. Thus $\\{x\\}$ is open. As $x\\in U$ was arbitrary and $U$ nonempty, this forces singletons to be open, i.e., $X$ is discrete. Hence, unless $X$ is discrete, $\\Delta(U)$ cannot be open. For a concrete counterexample, take $X=\\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology: for any nonempty open $U$, the set $\\Delta(U)$ is not open in $\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}$ because every basic neighborhood $A\\times B$ of a point $(x,x)$ contains points $(a,b)$ with $a\\neq b$, hence not contained in the diagonal. Therefore, statement A is false in general.\n\nWe now address whether $\\Delta$ is always a closed map and whether $\\Delta(X)$ is always closed. It is a standard fact that $X$ is Hausdorff if and only if the diagonal $\\Delta(X)$ is closed in $X\\times X$. Thus, for a non-Hausdorff space, $\\Delta(X)$ is not closed. As a specific counterexample, consider the Sierpiński space $X=\\{0,1\\}$ with open sets $\\{\\varnothing,\\{1\\},\\{0,1\\}\\}$. Then\n$$\n\\Delta(X)=\\{(0,0),(1,1)\\}\\subset X\\times X,\n$$\nand its complement $\\{(0,1),(1,0)\\}$ is not open because any basic neighborhood $U\\times V$ of $(0,1)$ must have $U$ open containing $0$ and $V$ open containing $1$, hence $U=\\{0,1\\}$ and $V\\in\\{\\{1\\},\\{0,1\\}\\}$. For any such choice of $U$ and $V$, we have $1 \\in U$ and $1 \\in V$, so $(1,1) \\in U \\times V$. This means any neighborhood of $(0,1)$ contains a point from the diagonal, so the complement of the diagonal cannot be open. Therefore $\\Delta(X)$ is not closed in this space. Consequently, statement C is false in general. Furthermore, if $\\Delta$ were always a closed map, then $\\Delta(X)$ (the image of the closed set $X$) would always be closed, contradicting the counterexample above. Hence statement B is also false in general.\n\nFinally, statement E is false because we have shown $\\Delta$ is continuous for every $X$, not only for discrete $X$.\n\nTherefore, the only universally true statement is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1667035"}, {"introduction": "While the basis for the product topology on $\\mathbb{R}^2 = \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ consists of open rectangles, not every open set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is itself a simple rectangle.
