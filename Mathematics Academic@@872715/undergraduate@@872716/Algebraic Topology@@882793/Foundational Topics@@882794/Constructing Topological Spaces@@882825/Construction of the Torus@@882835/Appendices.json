A torus is constructed from this square by identifying points on its boundary. This process is formalized by defining an equivalence relation $\\sim$ on $X$. The relation is generated by the following two rules of identification:\n\n1. For any real number $x$ such that $0 \\le x \\le 1$, the point $(x, 0)$ is identified with the point $(x, 1)$.
