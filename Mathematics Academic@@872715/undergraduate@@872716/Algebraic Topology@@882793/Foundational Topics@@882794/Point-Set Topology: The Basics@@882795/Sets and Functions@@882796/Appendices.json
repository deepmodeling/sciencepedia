Together with the general inclusion, we get $f(A \\cap B) = f(A) \\cap f(B)$ for all $A,B \\subseteq X$.\n\nNecessity (equality for all subsets implies injective): Suppose that for all $A,B \\subseteq X$, we have $f(A \\cap B) = f(A) \\cap f(B)$. Assume for contradiction that $f$ is not injective. Then there exist $x_{1}, x_{2} \\in X$ with $x_{1} \\neq x_{2}$ and $f(x_{1}) = f(x_{2})$. Let $A = \\{x_{1}\\}$ and $B = \\{x_{2}\\}$.
