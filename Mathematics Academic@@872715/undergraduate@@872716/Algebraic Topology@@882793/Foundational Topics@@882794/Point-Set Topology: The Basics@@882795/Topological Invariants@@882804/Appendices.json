The two units are attached by identifying a single vertex from the first unit with a single vertex from the second unit. The two units share exactly one point—this common vertex.\n\nThe Euler characteristic, denoted by $\\chi$, of a polyhedral complex is given by the formula $\\chi = V - E + F$, where $V$ is the total number of vertices, $E$ is the total number of edges, and $F$ is the total number of faces in the complex.\n\nCalculate the Euler characteristic, $\\chi$, of the final composite sculpture.", "solution": "Let $S$ be one stellated unit.

Seifert's algorithm provides a constructive method to build such a surface from a given diagram (a 2D projection) of the knot. The algorithm first resolves all crossings of the knot diagram to produce a set of disjoint simple closed curves in the plane, called Seifert circles. Let the number of these circles be $d$. These circles are considered to bound $d$ disjoint disks, which form the initial pieces of the surface.
