A major theorem in algebraic topology states that if two spaces are homotopy equivalent, their fundamental groups must be isomorphic. Therefore, if $T^2$ could deformation retract onto a subspace homeomorphic to $X$, it would imply that their fundamental groups, $G_T = \\pi_1(T^2)$ and $G_X = \\pi_1(X)$, are isomorphic. The problem states that such a retraction is impossible, so we are looking for a property that prevents this isomorphism.\n\nFirst, let's determine the fundamental group of the torus, $G_T = \\pi_1(T^2)$. The torus is the Cartesian product of two circles, $T^2 = S^1 \\times S^1$. The fundamental group of a product of spaces is the direct product of their fundamental groups: $\\pi_1(A \\times B) \\cong \\pi_1(A) \\times \\pi_1(B)$. The fundamental group of a single circle is the group of integers under addition, $\\pi_1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Applying this, we get:\n$$G_T = \\pi_1(S^1 \\times S^1) \\cong \\pi_1(S^1) \\times \\pi_1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$$\nThe group $\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ is the direct product of two copies of the integers. This is an abelian (commutative) group, because for any two elements $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ in $\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$, the group operation (component-wise addition) satisfies $(a, b) + (c, d) = (a+c, b+d) = (c+a, d+b) = (c, d) + (a, b)$.\n\nNext, let's determine the fundamental group of the figure-eight space, $G_X = \\pi_1(X)$. The figure-eight is the wedge sum of two circles, $X = S^1 \\vee S^1$. The Seifert-van Kampen theorem provides a way to compute the fundamental group of such a union. For a wedge sum of path-connected spaces with a suitable base point, the fundamental group of the wedge sum is the free product of the individual fundamental groups: $\\pi_1(A \\vee B) \\cong \\pi_1(A) * \\pi_1(B)$. Applying this, we find:\n$$G_X = \\pi_1(S^1 \\vee S^1) \\cong \\pi_1(S^1) * \\pi_1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z}$$\nThe group $\\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z}$ is the free product of two copies of the integers, which is also known as the free group on two generators. Let's call the generators of the two $\\mathbb{Z}$ groups $a$ and $b$ respectively. In the free product $\\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z}$, the elements are words formed by concatenating powers of $a$ and $b$. This group is non-abelian. For example, the element $ab$ (representing a loop around the first circle then the second) is not the same as the element $ba$ (a loop around the second circle then the first). Thus, $ab \\neq ba$.\n\nNow we compare the properties of $G_T \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ and $G_X \\cong \\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe crucial difference is that $G_T$ is abelian, while $G_X$ is non-abelian. An abelian group can never be isomorphic to a non-abelian group, as the property of being abelian is preserved under isomorphism. Since $G_T$ and $G_X$ are not isomorphic, $T^2$ cannot be homotopy equivalent to $X$, and therefore $T^2$ cannot deformation retract onto a subspace homeomorphic to $X$.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on our findings:\nA. $G_T$ is a torsion-free group, while $G_X$ is a group with non-trivial torsion. This is false. Both $\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z}$ are torsion-free, meaning only the identity element has finite order.\nB. $G_T$ is a finitely generated group, while $G_X$ is not finitely generated. This is false. Both groups are finitely generated by two elements.\nC. $G_T$ is an abelian group, while $G_X$ is a non-abelian group. This is true and correctly identifies the fundamental structural difference that prevents isomorphism.\nD. $G_T$ is an infinite group, while $G_X$ is a finite group. This is false. Both groups are infinite.\nE. $G_T$ is a non-trivial group, while $G_X$ is the trivial group. This is false.
