We will compute the commutator $[g,h]$ for two arbitrary elements $g = g(a,b,c)$ and $h = g(x,y,z)$.\n\nFirst, let's find the inverse of an element $g(a,b,c)$.\nThe inverse $g(a,b,c)^{-1}$ must be $g(a',b',c')$ such that their product is the identity matrix $g(0,0,0)$.\n$g(a,b,c)g(a',b',c') = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & a & c \\\\ 0 & 1 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & a' & c' \\\\ 0 & 1 & b' \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & a+a' & c+c'+ab' \\\\ 0 & 1 & b+b' \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor this to be the identity, we need:\n$a+a' = 0 \\implies a' = -a$\n$b+b' = 0 \\implies b' = -b$\n$c+c'+ab' = 0 \\implies c' = -c-ab' = -c-a(-b) = ab-c$.\nSo, $g(a,b,c)^{-1} = g(-a, -b, ab-c)$.\n\nNow, we compute the product $gh$:\n$gh = g(a,b,c)g(x,y,z) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & a+x & c+z+ay \\\\ 0 & 1 & b+y \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = g(a+x, b+y, c+z+ay)$.\n\nThe commutator is $[g,h] = g^{-1} h^{-1} g h$. The commutator $[g(a,b,c), g(x,y,z)]$ can be computed to be $g(0, 0, ay-xb)$. All arithmetic is modulo 11.\n\nAn element $g=g(a,b,c)$ is in the center $Z_1(G)$ if $[g,h]=e=g(0,0,0)$ for all $h=g(x,y,z)$.\nThis means $ay-xb \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ for all $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{11}$.\nLet's test this condition.\nIf we choose $h=g(1,0,0)$, then $x=1, y=0$.

The condition becomes $a(1)-0(b) = a \\equiv 0$, so $a=0$.\nSo, an element $g(a,b,c)$ is in the center if and only if $a=0$ and $b=0$.

This means we must check if the commutator $[g_0, h]$ is in $Z_1(G)$ for any choice of $h = g(x,y,z)$ in $G$.\n\nLet's compute the commutator $[g_0, h]$ using our general formula $[g(a,b,c), g(x,y,z)] = g(0, 0, ay-xb)$ with $(a,b,c)=(3,4,7)$:\n$$\n[g_0, h] = [g(3,4,7), g(x,y,z)] = g(0, 0, 3y-4x)\n$$\nThe resulting element is of the form $g(0,0,c')$ where $c' = 3y-4x$.\nDoes this element belong to $Z_1(G)$?\nFrom Step 2, we know that $Z_1(G)$ consists of all elements of the form $g(0,0,c')$.\nThe commutator $[g_0, h]$ is always of this form, for any choice of $h$. Therefore, $[g_0, h] \\in Z_1(G)$ for all $h \\in G$.\n\nIn fact, this is true not just for $g_0$, but for *any* element $g(a,b,c) \\in G$. The commutator $[g(a,b,c), g(x,y,z)] = g(0,0,ay-xb)$ is always an element of the center $Z_1(G)$. This implies that *every* element of $G$ satisfies the condition for being in $Z_2(G)$. Therefore, $Z_2(G) = G$.\n\nSince $Z_2(G) = G$, our element $g_0$ must be in $Z_2(G)$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have found that:\n- $g_0 \\notin Z_0(G)$\n- $g_0 \\notin Z_1(G)$\n- $g_0 \\in Z_2(G)$\n\nThe smallest non-negative integer $i$ for which $g_0 \\in Z_i(G)$ is therefore $i=2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1656512"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of any mathematical property involves knowing not just what it is, but also how it behaves under various operations.
