The abelianization of a group $H$ is given by the quotient group $H/[H,H]$, where $[H,H]$ is the commutator subgroup of $H$. For the symmetric group $S_n$ with $n \\ge 3$, the commutator subgroup $[S_n, S_n]$ is the alternating group $A_n$.

Up to isomorphism, there is only one group of order 2, which is the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nTherefore, $S_3^{\\text{ab}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nNext, let's find the abelianization of $\\mathbb{Z}_4$. The group $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ is the cyclic group of order 4, which is an abelian group. For any abelian group $H$, all commutators are the identity element, since $ghg^{-1}h^{-1} = gg^{-1}hh^{-1} = e$ for all $g, h \\in H$. Thus, the commutator subgroup $[H,H]$ is the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\nIn our case, since $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ is abelian, its commutator subgroup is the trivial subgroup containing only the identity element, which is $0$ in additive notation.\n$$[\\mathbb{Z}_4, \\mathbb{Z}_4] = \\{0\\}$$\nThe abelianization of $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ is the quotient group:\n$$\\mathbb{Z}_4^{\\text{ab}} = \\mathbb{Z}_4 / [\\mathbb{Z}_4, \\mathbb{Z}_4] = \\mathbb{Z}_4 / \\{0\\}$$\nThis quotient group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ itself.\nTherefore, $\\mathbb{Z}_4^{\\text{ab}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_4$.\n\nFinally, we combine these results to find the abelianization of $G = S_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_4$:\n$$G^{\\text{ab}} \\cong S_3^{\\text{ab}} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_4^{\\text{ab}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_4$$\nThe resulting group is the direct product of the cyclic group of order 2 and the cyclic group of order 4.

The group has order $|G|=p^{3}$ as there are $p$ choices for each of $a, b, c$.\n\nFirst, we find the explicit group law by multiplying two such matrices:\n$$\nM(a,b,c)\\,M(a',b',c') \\;=\\; M\\big(a+a',\\, b+b',\\, c+c'+ab'\\big).\n$$\nFrom this, we can find the inverse $M(a,b,c)^{-1} = M(-a, -b, ab-c)$.\n\nThe commutator subgroup $G'$ is generated by all commutators $[x,y] = xyx^{-1}y^{-1}$ for $x, y \\in G$.

These elements form a subgroup which is the center of $G$, let's call it $Z$. So, the commutator subgroup $G'$ is contained in $Z$.\n\nTo show that $G'$ is equal to $Z$, we need to show that we can generate any element $M(0,0,k)$ as a product of commutators. The value of the commutator is $k = ab' - a'b$. By choosing $a=1, b=0$ and $a'=0, b'=1$, we get the commutator $M(0,0,1)$. Since any element $M(0,0,k)$ can be written as $M(0,0,1)^k$, and $M(0,0,1)$ is a commutator, all elements of $Z$ are in $G'$. Therefore, the commutator subgroup is precisely the center, $G' = Z$.\n\nThe subgroup $Z$ consists of matrices $M(0,0,c)$ where $c$ can be any of the $p$ elements of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$.
