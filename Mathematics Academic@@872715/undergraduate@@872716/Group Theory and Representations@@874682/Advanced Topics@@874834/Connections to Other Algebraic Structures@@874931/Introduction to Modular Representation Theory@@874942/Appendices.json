Since $3$ divides $|D_{12}|=12$, the group algebra $\\mathbb{F}_{3}[D_{12}]$ is not semisimple.\n\nA fundamental theorem of modular representation theory states that over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p$, the number of isomorphism classes of simple modules for $kG$ equals the number of conjugacy classes of $p$-regular elements of $G$ (elements whose order is not divisible by $p$). We apply this with $p=3$.\n\nFirst, determine the conjugacy classes in $D_{12}$. For $n=6$ even, the classes are:\n- Rotations: $\\{1\\}$, $\\{r^{3}\\}$ (central of order $2$), $\\{r,r^{5}\\}$ (order $6$), $\\{r^{2},r^{4}\\}$ (order $3$).\n- Reflections: two conjugacy classes, each consisting of elements of order $2$.\n\nThe $3$-regular elements are those of orders not divisible by $3$, hence of order $1$ or $2$. Therefore the $3$-regular conjugacy classes are\n$$\n\\{1\\},\\quad \\{r^{3}\\},\\quad \\text{(first reflection class)},\\quad \\text{(second reflection class)},\n$$\nwhich are $4$ classes in total. Hence over an algebraically closed field $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_{3}$ the number of simple $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_{3}[D_{12}]$-modules is $4$.\n\nNow compare with $\\mathbb{F}_{3}$. The only $p'$-orders here are $1$ and $2$, so the relevant roots of unity are of order dividing $2$. Since $\\mathbb{F}_{3}^{\\times}$ is cyclic of order $2$, $\\mathbb{F}_{3}$ already contains all needed $p'$-roots of unity, so there is no Galois fusion of absolutely irreducible modules; equivalently, the Frobenius action on Brauer characters is trivial. Thus the number of simple modules over $\\mathbb{F}_{3}$ equals the number over $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_{3}$, namely $4$.\n\nAs an independent check, one-dimensional simple modules over $\\mathbb{F}_{3}$ correspond to group homomorphisms $D_{12}\\to \\mathbb{F}_{3}^{\\times}$.
