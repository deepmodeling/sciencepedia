## Introduction
In the study of [group representations](@entry_id:145425), a fundamental task is to understand the relationship between the representations of a group $G$ and those of its subgroups. While restriction allows us to move from $G$ to a subgroup $H$, the more powerful operation of induction constructs representations of $G$ from those of $H$. This raises a critical question: what happens when these two operations are combined? Specifically, if we induce a representation from a subgroup $H$ to $G$ and then restrict it back down to another subgroup $K$, what is the structure of the resulting representation? This is not merely a technical curiosity but a central problem that holds the key to understanding how representations of different subgroups interact within the larger group.

The Mackey Subgroup Theorem provides a complete and elegant answer to this question. It offers a precise formula that decomposes the restricted [induced representation](@entry_id:140832) into a [direct sum](@entry_id:156782) of more manageable pieces, each related to the intersection of $K$ with conjugates of $H$. This article serves as a comprehensive guide to this cornerstone of representation theory. In "Principles and Mechanisms," we will dissect the theorem's formal statement, exploring the essential concepts of [double cosets](@entry_id:145342) and conjugate representations. Following that, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will demonstrate the theorem's immense practical utility, from proving deep structural results like the [irreducibility criterion](@entry_id:146311) to providing a framework for problems in geometry and the physical sciences. Finally, the "Hands-On Practices" section will offer you a chance to apply these concepts to concrete problems, solidifying your understanding of this powerful tool.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The study of [group representations](@entry_id:145425) often involves three fundamental operations: forming subrepresentations, forming quotient representations, and, crucially, constructing representations of a larger group $G$ from those of a subgroup $H$. This last operation, known as **induction**, is a cornerstone of the theory. A natural and deeply important question then arises: what is the relationship between representations induced from different subgroups, or what happens when a representation induced from a subgroup $H$ is then **restricted** back down to another subgroup $K$? The Mackey Subgroup Theorem, also known as the Mackey decomposition formula, provides a comprehensive and elegant answer to this question. It decomposes the restricted representation into a [direct sum](@entry_id:156782) of simpler, more manageable pieces, revealing a profound underlying structure governed by the interplay between the subgroups $H$ and $K$. To fully appreciate its power, we must first understand its constituent parts.

### The Anatomy of the Mackey Formula: Double Cosets and Conjugate Representations

The Mackey formula is expressed in terms of two fundamental concepts: [double cosets](@entry_id:145342) and conjugate representations. A firm grasp of these ideas is essential before proceeding to the theorem itself.

#### Double Cosets

Given a group $G$ and two subgroups $H$ and $K$, a **double [coset](@entry_id:149651)** is a set of the form $KgH = \{kgh \mid k \in K, h \in H\}$ for some element $g \in G$. Just as left (or right) [cosets](@entry_id:147145) partition a group, the set of all [double cosets](@entry_id:145342), denoted $K \setminus G / H$, forms a partition of $G$. That is, $G$ is the disjoint union of its distinct [double cosets](@entry_id:145342).

In certain cases, the structure of these [double cosets](@entry_id:145342) is remarkably simple. For instance, if $G$ is an abelian group (where the operation is written additively), a double coset takes the form $K+g+H$. Since the group is commutative, any element $k+g+h$ can be rewritten as $g+(k+h)$. This means the entire double coset is simply the left coset $g+(K+H)$ of the subgroup sum $K+H$. Consequently, the number of distinct [double cosets](@entry_id:145342) is the index of the subgroup $K+H$ in $G$.

As a concrete example, consider the [abelian group](@entry_id:139381) $G = \mathbb{Z}/180\mathbb{Z}$ with subgroups $H = 12\mathbb{Z}/180\mathbb{Z}$ and $K = 30\mathbb{Z}/180\mathbb{Z}$. The sum of these subgroups, $K+H$, consists of all elements of the form $30a + 12b \pmod{180}$. This sum is itself a subgroup generated by $\gcd(30, 12) = 6$. Thus, $K+H = 6\mathbb{Z}/180\mathbb{Z}$. The number of [double cosets](@entry_id:145342) is therefore the index $[G : K+H] = [\mathbb{Z}/180\mathbb{Z} : 6\mathbb{Z}/180\mathbb{Z}] = 6$.

For [non-abelian groups](@entry_id:145211), a more general and powerful interpretation is available. There exists a fundamental bijection between the set of [double cosets](@entry_id:145342) $K \setminus G / H$ and the set of orbits of $K$ acting on the set of left cosets $G/H$ by left multiplication ($k \cdot gH = (kg)H$). The double coset $KgH$ corresponds to the orbit of the [coset](@entry_id:149651) $gH$ under the action of $K$. Therefore, counting [double cosets](@entry_id:145342) is equivalent to counting these orbits. This connection is sometimes called the [orbit-stabilizer theorem](@entry_id:145230) for [double cosets](@entry_id:145342).

To illustrate this, let $G$ be the symmetric group $S_5$ acting on the set $\Omega$ of all 2-element subsets of $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$. Let $\alpha = \{1, 2\}$ and $\beta = \{1, 3\}$, and let $H = \mathrm{Stab}_G(\alpha)$ and $K = \mathrm{Stab}_G(\beta)$. Since the action of $G$ on $\Omega$ is transitive, the set of [cosets](@entry_id:147145) $G/H$ is in bijection with $\Omega$. The number of [double cosets](@entry_id:145342) $|K \setminus G / H|$ is therefore the number of orbits of $K$ acting on $\Omega$. The subgroup $K$, which stabilizes $\{1, 3\}$, acts on the other 2-element subsets. We can classify these subsets by the size of their intersection with $\beta=\{1,3\}$.
*   Intersection size 2: Only $\beta$ itself, forming one orbit.
*   Intersection size 1: Subsets like $\{1, 4\}, \{3, 5\}$, etc. All such subsets are in a single orbit under the action of $K$.
*   Intersection size 0: Subsets like $\{2, 4\}, \{4, 5\}$, etc., drawn from the complement of $\beta$. These also form a single orbit.
This gives a total of 3 orbits, and thus there are 3 [double cosets](@entry_id:145342) $K \setminus G / H$. This combinatorial viewpoint is often the most effective way to enumerate [double cosets](@entry_id:145342) in practice, for instance by using Burnside's Lemma.

#### Conjugate Representations

The second key ingredient is the **[conjugate representation](@entry_id:139136)**. Let $(\pi, W)$ be a representation of a subgroup $H \le G$. For any element $s \in G$, we can define a new subgroup $H^s = sHs^{-1} = \{shs^{-1} \mid h \in H\}$, which is isomorphic to $H$. We can also define a representation of this new subgroup, denoted $(\pi^s, W)$, which acts on the same vector space $W$. Its action is defined by "undoing" the conjugation by $s$: for any element $x \in H^s$, we have $x=shs^{-1}$ for a unique $h \in H$, and we define the action of $x$ as:
$$ \pi^s(x) = \pi^s(shs^{-1}) := \pi(h) $$
An equivalent and often more useful definition is $\pi^s(x) = \pi(s^{-1}xs)$ for all $x \in H^s$. This definition makes it clear that to compute the action of an element $x$ in the [conjugate representation](@entry_id:139136), one must first map it back to $H$ via conjugation by $s^{-1}$, apply the original representation $\pi$, and use the resulting [linear transformation](@entry_id:143080).

Let's consider a simple example. Let $G = S_3$, the symmetric group on three elements, and let $H$ be the subgroup $\{e, (12)\}$. Let $\pi$ be the [one-dimensional representation](@entry_id:136509) of $H$ where $\pi((12)) = -1$. Now, let $s = (13) \in G$. The conjugate subgroup is $H^s = sHs^{-1} = \{(13)e(13)^{-1}, (13)(12)(13)^{-1}\} = \{e, (23)\}$. The [conjugate representation](@entry_id:139136) $\pi^s$ is a representation of this new subgroup $H^s$. To find the value of $\pi^s((23))$, we use the definition:
$$ \pi^s((23)) = \pi(s^{-1}(23)s) = \pi((13)^{-1}(23)(13)) $$
Since $(13)^{-1} = (13)$, we compute the conjugation $(13)(23)(13) = (12)$. Therefore:
$$ \pi^s((23)) = \pi((12)) = -1 $$
This demonstrates that $\pi^s$ is a distinct representation acting on a different subgroup, yet its character values are intrinsically linked to those of $\pi$.

### The Mackey Subgroup Theorem Stated and Deconstructed

With the concepts of [double cosets](@entry_id:145342) and conjugate representations in hand, we can now state the Mackey Subgroup Theorem.

**Theorem (Mackey):** Let $G$ be a finite group with subgroups $H$ and $K$. Let $(\pi, W)$ be a representation of $H$. Then there is an isomorphism of $K$-representations:
$$ \mathrm{Res}^G_K(\mathrm{Ind}^G_H(\pi)) \cong \bigoplus_{s \in S} \mathrm{Ind}^{K}_{K \cap H^s}(\mathrm{Res}^{H^s}_{K \cap H^s}(\pi^s)) $$
Here, $S$ is a set of representatives for the [double cosets](@entry_id:145342) in $K \setminus G / H$, and we write $H^s = sHs^{-1}$.

This formula, while appearing complex, describes a very logical process. It tells us that to understand the representation obtained by inducing $\pi$ from $H$ to $G$ and then restricting to $K$, we can proceed as follows:
1.  **Decompose by Double Cosets**: The representation splits into a [direct sum](@entry_id:156782) of simpler representations, one for each double [coset](@entry_id:149651) $KsH$.
2.  **For each double coset representative $s$**:
    a. **Conjugate**: Form the [conjugate representation](@entry_id:139136) $\pi^s$ of the subgroup $H^s = sHs^{-1}$.
    b. **Restrict**: Restrict this [conjugate representation](@entry_id:139136) $\pi^s$ to the intersection of its domain with $K$, which is the subgroup $K \cap H^s$.
    c. **Induce**: Take this restricted representation and induce it up to the group $K$.

The resulting representation of $K$ is a building block of our final decomposition. The theorem states that the restricted representation $\mathrm{Res}^G_K(\mathrm{Ind}^G_H(\pi))$ is precisely the [direct sum](@entry_id:156782) of these building blocks over all the [double cosets](@entry_id:145342).

The nature of each summand $\mathrm{Ind}^{K}_{K \cap H^s}(\dots)$ depends heavily on the structure of the intersection subgroup $K \cap H^s$. A particularly insightful case occurs when this intersection is trivial, i.e., $K \cap H^s = \{e\}$. In this scenario, the representation $\pi^s$ (of dimension $d = \dim(\pi)$) is restricted to the [trivial subgroup](@entry_id:141709), resulting in a direct sum of $d$ copies of the trivial representation of $\{e\}$. Inducing the [trivial representation](@entry_id:141357) of $\{e\}$ up to $K$ yields the **[regular representation](@entry_id:137028)** of $K$, denoted $\mathbb{C}[K]$. Thus, for each double coset representative $s$ where the intersection is trivial, the corresponding summand in the Mackey formula is isomorphic to $d \cdot \mathbb{C}[K]$. This observation shows how the structure of the group, encoded in the [double cosets](@entry_id:145342) and subgroup intersections, translates directly into the structure of the representation. The term corresponding to the "trivial" double [coset](@entry_id:149651) $KH$ (for which we can choose $s=e$) is always present and takes the form $\mathrm{Ind}^{K}_{K \cap H}(\mathrm{Res}^{H}_{K \cap H}(\pi))$.

### Major Applications of the Mackey Theorem

The Mackey theorem is far more than a notational convenience; it is a powerful computational and theoretical tool. Its primary applications include calculating the dimension of spaces of intertwining operators, establishing criteria for the irreducibility of [induced representations](@entry_id:136842), and revealing deep structural properties of [representations of groups](@entry_id:156757) with normal subgroups.

#### Intertwining Numbers and Frobenius Reciprocity

A central question in [representation theory](@entry_id:137998) is to determine whether two representations are related, and if so, how. The vector space of $G$-module homomorphisms (or **intertwining operators**) between two representations $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$, denoted $\mathrm{Hom}_G(\rho_1, \rho_2)$, provides the answer. Its dimension, known as the **intertwining number**, counts how many times the irreducible constituents of $\rho_1$ appear in $\rho_2$ (or vice versa).

The Mackey theorem, combined with Frobenius reciprocity, provides a general formula for the intertwining number between two [induced representations](@entry_id:136842). Let $\pi$ be a representation of $H$ and $\psi$ be a representation of $K$. The dimension of $\mathrm{Hom}_G(\mathrm{Ind}_H^G(\pi), \mathrm{Ind}_K^G(\psi))$ can be computed as:
\begin{align*} \dim \mathrm{Hom}_G(\mathrm{Ind}_H^G(\pi), \mathrm{Ind}_K^G(\psi)) = \dim \mathrm{Hom}_K(\mathrm{Res}^G_K \mathrm{Ind}_H^G(\pi), \psi) \\ = \sum_{s \in K \setminus G / H} \dim \mathrm{Hom}_K(\mathrm{Ind}^K_{K \cap H^s}(\mathrm{Res}^{H^s}_{K \cap H^s}(\pi^s)), \psi) \\ = \sum_{s \in K \setminus G / H} \dim \mathrm{Hom}_{K \cap H^s}(\mathrm{Res}^{H^s}_{K \cap H^s}(\pi^s), \mathrm{Res}^K_{K \cap H^s}(\psi)) \end{align*}
This formula transforms a problem about the large group $G$ into a sum of smaller problems concerning the intersection subgroups $K \cap H^s$.

In some cases, this formula simplifies dramatically. Consider $G = S_4$, with $H = \langle (1234) \rangle$ and $K = \langle (123) \rangle$. Since $|H|=4$ and $|K|=3$ are coprime, the intersection of $H$ with any conjugate of $K$ must be the [trivial subgroup](@entry_id:141709), i.e., $H \cap xKx^{-1} = \{e\}$ for all $x \in G$. If we take any [irreducible characters](@entry_id:145398) $\pi$ of $H$ and $\psi$ of $K$, the formula for $\dim \mathrm{Hom}_G(\mathrm{Ind}_H^G(\pi), \mathrm{Ind}_K^G(\psi))$ simplifies. Each summand involves $\mathrm{Hom}_{\{e\}}(\dots)$, which is always 1-dimensional. The dimension is therefore simply the number of terms in the sum, which is the number of [double cosets](@entry_id:145342), $|H \setminus G / K|$. Using Burnside's Lemma, one can calculate that $|H \setminus G / K| = 2$. Thus, the dimension of the homomorphism space is 2. This elegant result is obtained almost entirely by structural group-theoretic arguments, with the Mackey formula providing the crucial bridge. This principle extends even to certain [infinite groups](@entry_id:147005), where for [permutation representations](@entry_id:142960) on finite-index subgroups of $G=\mathbb{Z}^2$, the dimension of the intertwining space is again the number of [double cosets](@entry_id:145342).

#### Mackey's Irreducibility Criterion

One of the most celebrated consequences of the Mackey theorem is a necessary and sufficient condition for an [induced representation](@entry_id:140832) to be irreducible. By applying the intertwining number formula to the case where $H=K$ and $\pi=\psi$, we can compute the dimension of the [endomorphism algebra](@entry_id:136554), $\mathrm{End}_G(\mathrm{Ind}^G_H(\pi)) = \mathrm{Hom}_G(\mathrm{Ind}^G_H(\pi), \mathrm{Ind}^G_H(\pi))$. By Schur's Lemma, a representation is irreducible if and only if the dimension of its [endomorphism algebra](@entry_id:136554) is 1.

The Mackey formula yields:
$$ \dim \mathrm{End}_G(\mathrm{Ind}^G_H(\pi)) = \sum_{s \in H \setminus G / H} \dim \mathrm{Hom}_{H \cap H^s}(\mathrm{Res}(\pi), \mathrm{Res}(\pi^s)) $$
The term for the trivial double [coset](@entry_id:149651) $H$ (with representative $s=e$) is $\dim \mathrm{Hom}_H(\pi, \pi)$. If $\pi$ is irreducible, this dimension is 1. For $\mathrm{Ind}^G_H(\pi)$ to be irreducible, this must be the *only* non-zero contribution. This leads to **Mackey's Irreducibility Criterion**:

An [induced representation](@entry_id:140832) $\mathrm{Ind}^G_H(\pi)$ is irreducible if and only if:
1.  The representation $\pi$ of $H$ is irreducible.
2.  For every $s \in G \setminus H$, the representations $\mathrm{Res}^{H}_{H \cap H^s}(\pi)$ and $\mathrm{Res}^{H^s}_{H \cap H^s}(\pi^s)$ are disjoint (i.e., they share no common irreducible constituents).

This criterion is extremely powerful. It states that for an [induced representation](@entry_id:140832) to remain "atomic" (irreducible), the original representation $\pi$ must not only be atomic itself, but it must also be "sufficiently different" from all of its conjugates on the relevant intersection subgroups.

#### Connections to Clifford Theory

The Mackey formula also illuminates the structure of representations restricted to normal subgroups, a topic central to Clifford theory. Consider a group $G$ that is a [semidirect product](@entry_id:147230) $G = N \rtimes H$, where $N$ is a [normal subgroup](@entry_id:144438). What happens when we induce a representation $\pi$ from $H$ and then restrict it back to $N$?

We apply the Mackey formula to $\mathrm{Res}^G_N(\mathrm{Ind}^G_H(\pi))$. Since $N$ is normal and $G=NH$, there is only one double [coset](@entry_id:149651) in $N \setminus G / H$, namely $NGH = G$ itself. We can choose the identity element $s=e$ as its representative. The formula thus collapses from a sum to a single term:
$$ \mathrm{Res}^G_N(\mathrm{Ind}^G_H(\pi)) \cong \mathrm{Ind}^{N}_{N \cap H}(\mathrm{Res}^{H}_{N \cap H}(\pi)) $$
In the [semidirect product](@entry_id:147230) case, $N \cap H = \{e\}$. Let $d_\pi$ be the dimension of $\pi$. The restriction of $\pi$ to $\{e\}$ is $d_\pi$ copies of the [trivial representation](@entry_id:141357). The formula becomes:
$$ \mathrm{Res}^G_N(\mathrm{Ind}^G_H(\pi)) \cong \mathrm{Ind}^{N}_{\{e\}}(d_\pi \cdot 1_{\{e\}}) \cong d_\pi \cdot \mathbb{C}[N] $$
This stunning result shows that the restriction is simply $d_\pi$ copies of the [regular representation](@entry_id:137028) of $N$. The character of this representation is $|N|d_\pi$ at the identity and 0 on all other elements of $N$, a fact that can be verified by direct character computation. This provides a fundamental example of the principles of Clifford theory, which describes how [irreducible representations](@entry_id:138184) of $G$ decompose upon restriction to a normal subgroup.

In conclusion, the Mackey Subgroup Theorem is a central organizing principle in [representation theory](@entry_id:137998). By breaking down the complex operations of [induction and restriction](@entry_id:182341) into a sum over [double cosets](@entry_id:145342), it provides a powerful computational tool, yields deep theoretical results like the [irreducibility criterion](@entry_id:146311), and elegantly connects the representation theory of a group to the rich combinatorial and algebraic structure of its subgroups.
