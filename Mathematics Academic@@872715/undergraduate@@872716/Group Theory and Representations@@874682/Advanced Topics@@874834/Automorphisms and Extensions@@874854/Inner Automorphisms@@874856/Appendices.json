That is, $\\mathrm{Inn}(G) \\cong G/Z(G)$.\n\nThus, the problem is equivalent to determining if the quotient groups $D_8/Z(D_8)$ and $Q_8/Z(Q_8)$ are isomorphic. We will analyze each group separately.\n\nFirst, let's find the center of the dihedral group $D_8$. The center $Z(D_8)$ consists of all elements that commute with every element in $D_8$. It is sufficient to check for commutation with the generators $r$ and $s$.\nThe elements of $D_8$ are $\\{1, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3\\}$.\nThe identity element $1$ is always in the center.\nLet's check the powers of $r$.\n- For $r$: $sr = r^{-1}s = r^3s$. Since $r \\neq r^3$, $srs^{-1} \\neq r$, so $r$ is not in the center.\n- For $r^2$: It commutes with $r$ since they are powers of the same element. Let's check with $s$: $sr^2 = srr = (r^{-1}s)r = r^{-1}(sr) = r^{-1}(r^{-1}s) = r^{-2}s = (r^4r^{-2})s = r^2s$. So, $sr^2 = r^2s$. Thus, $r^2$ is in the center $Z(D_8)$.\n- For $r^3$: $sr^3 = r^{-3}s = rs$. Since $sr^3 \\neq r^3s$, $r^3$ is not in the center.\nNow let's check the elements of the form $sr^k$. An element $sr^k$ commutes with $r$ if $(sr^k)r = r(sr^k)$, which simplifies to $sr^{k+1} = r^{-1}sr^k$. This is not satisfied for any $k$. Thus, no element of the form $sr^k$ is in the center.\nTherefore, the center of $D_8$ is $Z(D_8) = \\{1, r^2\\}$.\n\nNow we analyze the quotient group $D_8/Z(D_8)$.\nThe order of this group is $|D_8| / |Z(D_8)| = 8 / 2 = 4$.\nAny group of order 4 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ or the Klein four-group $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nTo determine which one, we can check the orders of the elements in the quotient group. The elements are the cosets of $Z(D_8)$. Let $\\bar{g}$ denote the coset $gZ(D_8)$. The identity is $\\bar{1} = Z(D_8)$.\nConsider the element $\\bar{r} = rZ(D_8)$. Its order is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $(rZ(D_8))^n = r^nZ(D_8) = Z(D_8)$, which means $r^n \\in Z(D_8)$.\n$(\\bar{r})^2 = r^2Z(D_8) = Z(D_8)$ since $r^2 \\in Z(D_8)$. The order of $\\bar{r}$ is 2.\nConsider the element $\\bar{s} = sZ(D_8)$.\n$(\\bar{s})^2 = s^2Z(D_8) = 1Z(D_8) = Z(D_8)$. The order of $\\bar{s}$ is 2.\nSince the group $D_8/Z(D_8)$ has order 4 and all its non-identity elements we have checked have order 2, it cannot be the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ (which has an element of order 4). Therefore, $D_8/Z(D_8)$ must be isomorphic to the Klein four-group, $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. So, $\\mathrm{Inn}(D_8) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nNext, let's find the center of the quaternion group $Q_8$.\nThe elements are $\\{\\pm 1, \\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$. The element $-1$ is central by definition. The element $1$ is always central. So $\\{1, -1\\} \\subseteq Z(Q_8)$.\nWe check if any other elements are central. Let's check $i$:\n$ij = k$ and $ji = -k$. Since $ij \\neq ji$, $i$ is not in the center.\nBy symmetry (relabeling $i,j,k$), $j$ and $k$ are also not in the center.\nSimilarly, $-i$ is not in the center because $(-i)j = -k$ while $j(-i) = -ji = k$.\nThus, the center of $Q_8$ is $Z(Q_8) = \\{1, -1\\}$.\n\nNow we analyze the quotient group $Q_8/Z(Q_8)$.\nThe order of this group is $|Q_8| / |Z(Q_8)| = 8 / 2 = 4$.\nAgain, this group is isomorphic to either $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ or $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nLet's check the orders of the elements. Let $\\bar{g}$ denote the coset $gZ(Q_8)$. The identity is $\\bar{1} = Z(Q_8)$.\nConsider the element $\\bar{i} = iZ(Q_8)$.\n$(\\bar{i})^2 = i^2Z(Q_8) = (-1)Z(Q_8) = Z(Q_8)$ since $-1 \\in Z(Q_8)$. The order of $\\bar{i}$ is 2.\nConsider the element $\\bar{j} = jZ(Q_8)$.\n$(\\bar{j})^2 = j^2Z(Q_8) = (-1)Z(Q_8) = Z(Q_8)$. The order of $\\bar{j}$ is 2.\nSince the group $Q_8/Z(Q_8)$ has order 4 and has elements of order 2, it cannot be the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_4$. Therefore, $Q_8/Z(Q_8)$ must also be isomorphic to the Klein four-group, $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. So, $\\mathrm{Inn}(Q_8) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nSince both $\\mathrm{Inn}(D_8)$ and $\\mathrm{Inn}(Q_8)$ are isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$, and isomorphism is an equivalence relation, we can conclude that $\\mathrm{Inn}(D_8) \\cong \\mathrm{Inn}(Q_8)$.\nThe answer is \"Yes\".\n\nOption C is incorrect. The isomorphism or non-isomorphism of $D_8$ and $Q_8$ themselves (they are not isomorphic, as $D_8$ has two elements of order 4 while $Q_8$ has six) does not preclude their inner automorphism groups from being isomorphic.\nOption D is incorrect. The groups are isomorphic, but not identical. The elements of $\\mathrm{Inn}(D_8)$ are functions on $D_8$, while the elements of $\\mathrm{Inn}(Q_8)$ are functions on $Q_8$. Since their domains are different sets, the groups cannot be identical.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1803626"}]}
