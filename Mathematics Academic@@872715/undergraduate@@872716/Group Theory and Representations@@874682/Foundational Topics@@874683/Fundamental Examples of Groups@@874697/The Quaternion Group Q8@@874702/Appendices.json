The order of an element $a$ in a group is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $a^n$ equals the identity element of the group.\n\nFirst, let's identify the elements and structure of the quotient group $Q_8/H$.\nThe order of the group $Q_8$ is $|Q_8|=8$.\nThe subgroup is $H = \\{1, -1, i, -i\\}$, so its order is $|H|=4$.\nThe number of distinct left cosets, which is the order of the quotient group $Q_8/H$, is given by Lagrange's theorem: $|Q_8/H| = |Q_8| / |H| = 8 / 4 = 2$.\n\nSince the quotient group has order 2, it must be isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, $C_2$. A group of order 2 has two elements: the identity and one other element of order 2. Let's find these elements explicitly.\n\nThe elements of $Q_8/H$ are the distinct left cosets of $H$ in $Q_8$.\nOne coset is the subgroup $H$ itself, which serves as the identity element of the quotient group. We can obtain it by multiplying any element of $H$ by $H$. For example:\n$1H = \\{1 \\cdot 1, 1 \\cdot (-1), 1 \\cdot i, 1 \\cdot (-i)\\} = \\{1, -1, i, -i\\} = H$.\n\nThe other coset can be found by taking an element of $Q_8$ that is not in $H$ and forming its coset. Let's use $j \\in Q_8$.\nThe coset $jH$ is:\n$jH = \\{j \\cdot 1, j \\cdot (-1), j \\cdot i, j \\cdot (-i)\\}$.\n\nWe use the defining relations of $Q_8$:\n$i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$.\nFrom $ijk = -1$, we can find $ij$: multiply on the right by $k^{-1}$. Since $k^2 = -1$, $k \\cdot k = -1$, so $k^{-1}=-k$. Thus, $ij = (-1)k^{-1} = (-1)(-k) = k$.\nThe other required relations are $ji=-k$, $jk=i$, $kj=-i$, $ki=j$, $ik=-j$.\n\nLet's compute the elements of $jH$:\n$j \\cdot 1 = j$\n$j \\cdot (-1) = -j$\n$j \\cdot i = -k$\n$j \\cdot (-i) = -(-k) = k$\n\nSo, the second coset is $jH = \\{j, -j, k, -k\\}$.\nThe two distinct elements of the quotient group $Q_8/H$ are $H$ and $jH$.\n\nThe identity element of $Q_8/H$ is $H$. We need to find the order of the element $jH$. This is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $(jH)^n = H$.\n\nLet's compute powers of $jH$:\nFor $n=1$: $(jH)^1 = jH$. Since $jH \\neq H$, the order is not 1.\n\nFor $n=2$: $(jH)^2 = (jH)(jH)$. By the definition of coset multiplication, this is $(j \\cdot j)H = j^2 H$.\nAccording to the relations of $Q_8$, we have $j^2 = -1$.\nSo, $(jH)^2 = (-1)H$.\n\nNow we must evaluate the coset $(-1)H$. An element $g$ belongs to $H$ if and only if the coset $gH$ is equal to $H$ itself.\nSince $-1$ is an element of the subgroup $H = \\{1, -1, i, -i\\}$, the coset $(-1)H$ is equal to $H$:\n$(-1)H = \\{-1 \\cdot 1, -1 \\cdot (-1), -1 \\cdot i, -1 \\cdot (-i)\\} = \\{-1, 1, -i, i\\} = H$.\n\nTherefore, $(jH)^2 = H$.\nSince $n=2$ is the smallest positive integer for which $(jH)^n = H$, the order of the element $jH$ in the group $Q_8/H$ is 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1652979"}]}
