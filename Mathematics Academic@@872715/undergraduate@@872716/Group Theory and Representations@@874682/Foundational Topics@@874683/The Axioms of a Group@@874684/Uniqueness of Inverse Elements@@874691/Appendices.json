It is defined on the set $Q_8 = \\{1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k\\}$. The group operation is multiplication, with $1$ being the identity element. The fundamental multiplication rules are given by:\n$$i^{2} = j^{2} = k^{2} = ijk = -1$$\nFrom these, other relations can be derived, such as the cyclic permutations $ij = k$, $jk = i$, and $ki = j$, as well as the anti-commutative properties $ji = -k$, $kj = -i$, and $ik = -j$.
