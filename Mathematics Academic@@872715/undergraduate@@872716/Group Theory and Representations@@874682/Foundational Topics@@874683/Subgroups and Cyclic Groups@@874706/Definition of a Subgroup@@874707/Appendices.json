For every element in $\\mathcal{J}$, its inverse (computed in the parent group) must also be in $\\mathcal{J}$.\n\nLet's analyze the set $\\mathcal{J}$. It is defined as the set of all $2 \\times 2$ matrices $A$ such that:\n- The entries of $A$ are all integers.\n- $A$ is invertible, which means its determinant is non-zero, i.e., $\\det(A) \\neq 0$.\n\nNow, let's check each criterion for the options provided.\n\n**Criterion 1: Identity Element**\n\nThe identity element of $GL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is the identity matrix $I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe entries of $I$ are 1 and 0, which are both integers.\nThe determinant of $I$ is $\\det(I) = (1)(1) - (0)(0) = 1$, which is non-zero.\nSince $I$ is a $2 \\times 2$ matrix with integer entries and a non-zero determinant, it belongs to the set $\\mathcal{J}$.\nThus, the first criterion is satisfied. This means that statement C, which claims the identity matrix is not in $\\mathcal{J}$, is incorrect.\n\n**Criterion 2: Closure under Multiplication**\n\nLet $A$ and $B$ be two arbitrary matrices in $\\mathcal{J}$. By definition, this means that $A$ and $B$ have all integer entries, and $\\det(A) \\neq 0$, $\\det(B) \\neq 0$.\nLet $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a_{11}  a_{12} \\\\ a_{21}  a_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$ and $B = \\begin{pmatrix} b_{11}  b_{12} \\\\ b_{21}  b_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$, where all $a_{ij}$ and $b_{ij}$ are integers.\nTheir product is $C = AB = \\begin{pmatrix} a_{11}b_{11}+a_{12}b_{21}  a_{11}b_{12}+a_{12}b_{22} \\\\ a_{21}b_{11}+a_{22}b_{21}  a_{21}b_{12}+a_{22}b_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSince the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is closed under addition and multiplication, each entry of the matrix $C$ is an integer.\nFurthermore, the determinant of the product is given by $\\det(C) = \\det(AB) = \\det(A)\\det(B)$. Since $\\det(A) \\neq 0$ and $\\det(B) \\neq 0$, their product $\\det(A)\\det(B)$ is also non-zero.\nTherefore, the product matrix $C=AB$ has all integer entries and is invertible. This means $AB \\in \\mathcal{J}$.\nThe set $\\mathcal{J}$ is closed under matrix multiplication. This means that statement B, which claims $\\mathcal{J}$ is not closed, is incorrect.\n\n**Criterion 3: Closure under Inversion**\n\nLet $A$ be an arbitrary matrix in $\\mathcal{J}$. Let $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\\\ c  d \\end{pmatrix}$, where $a, b, c, d$ are integers and $\\det(A) = ad-bc \\neq 0$.\nThe inverse of $A$ in $GL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is given by the formula:\n$$A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(A)}\\begin{pmatrix} d  -b \\\\ -c  a \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{d}{ad-bc}  \\frac{-b}{ad-bc} \\\\ \\frac{-c}{ad-bc}  \\frac{a}{ad-bc} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nFor $A^{-1}$ to be in $\\mathcal{J}$, all its entries must be integers. This is not guaranteed. We can test this with a specific counterexample.\nConsider the matrix $M = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe entries of $M$ are 2, 0, 0, 1, which are all integers.\nThe determinant is $\\det(M) = (2)(1) - (0)(0) = 2$. Since $\\det(M) \\neq 0$, the matrix $M$ is in $\\mathcal{J}$.\nNow, let's find the inverse of $M$:\n$$M^{-1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe entry $1/2$ is not an integer. Therefore, the inverse matrix $M^{-1}$ is not in $\\mathcal{J}$.\nSince we have found an element in $\\mathcal{J}$ whose inverse is not in $\\mathcal{J}$, the set is not closed under inversion. The third criterion for being a subgroup fails.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSince $\\mathcal{J}$ is not closed under taking inverses, it is not a subgroup of $GL_2(\\mathbb{R})$.\n- Statement A is incorrect because $\\mathcal{J}$ is not a subgroup.\n- Statement D correctly identifies the reason for failure: not all elements have their inverses within the set.\n- Statement E is incorrect because matrix multiplication is always associative.
