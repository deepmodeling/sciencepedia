The scrambling process consists of two sequential permutation steps. The first step applies the permutation $\\tau$, and the second step applies the permutation $\\sigma$. The permutations are defined in cycle notation as:\n$$ \\sigma = (1\\ 3\\ 5\\ 7)(2\\ 4\\ 6) $$\n$$ \\tau = (1\\ 2)(3\\ 4)(5\\ 6)(7\\ 8) $$\nA full scramble operation, denoted by the permutation $\\pi$, is the composition of these two steps, where $\\pi$ represents the net effect of applying $\\tau$ first, then $\\sigma$. The operation is applied repeatedly to the data blocks. Determine the minimum number of full scramble operations, $k$, that must be performed for all 8 data blocks to return to their original positions for the first time.", "solution": "We interpret the composition as applying $\\tau$ first and then $\\sigma$, so the net permutation is $\\pi=\\sigma\\circ\\tau$.
