We will start with the 'freest' possible group on two generators, $F_2$, and map it onto the non-abelian quaternion group, $Q_8$. By identifying the kernel of this map, we essentially discover a 'blueprint' for constructing $Q_8$, a concept known as a group presentation.", "problem": "Let $F_2$ be the free group on two generators, which we denote by $a$ and $b$. Let $Q_8$ be the quaternion group, whose set of elements is $\\{\\pm 1, \\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$. The group operation in $Q_8$ is defined by the relations $i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$, from which all other products can be derived (e.g., $ij=k$, $ji=-k$, $i^4=1$, etc.).\n\nConsider the group homomorphism $\\phi: F_2 \\to Q_8$ defined by mapping the generators of $F_2$ to a pair of generators for $Q_8$ as follows:\n$$ \\phi(a) = i $$\n$$ \\phi(b) = j $$\nThis mapping extends uniquely to a homomorphism for all elements in $F_2$. Since $i$ and $j$ generate $Q_8$, this homomorphism is an epimorphism (i.e., it is surjective).\n\nThe kernel of this homomorphism, $\\ker(\\phi)$, is a normal subgroup of $F_2$.
