Its elements are given by the set $Q_8 = \\{1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k\\}$. The group operation follows these defining relations:\n$$i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$$\nThese relations, along with the fact that $-1$ commutes with all elements and $1$ is the identity, define the multiplication for all elements. For example, from $ijk = -1$, we can find $ij=k$ by right-multiplying by $k^{-1}=-k$.\n\nLet $G$ be a group and $H$ be a subgroup of $G$.

Since $H$ is the cyclic subgroup generated by the permutation $\\sigma = (12)(34)$, we need to compute the powers of $\\sigma$.\nLet $e$ be the identity permutation.\n$\\sigma^1 = (12)(34)$.\n$\\sigma^2 = (12)(34)(12)(34) = (12)(12) (34)(34) = e \\cdot e = e$.\nSince $\\sigma^2 = e$, the subgroup $H$ consists of only two elements: $H = \\{e, \\sigma\\} = \\{e, (12)(34)\\}$. The order of the subgroup is $|H|=2$.\n\nNext, we use the definition of the normalizer: $N_{S_4}(H) = \\{g \\in S_4 \\mid gHg^{-1} = H\\}$.\nAn element $g \\in S_4$ is in $N_{S_4}(H)$ if and only if the set $\\{geg^{-1}, g\\sigma g^{-1}\\}$ is equal to the set $\\{e, \\sigma\\}$.\nSince $geg^{-1} = e$ for any $g \\in S_4$, this condition simplifies to requiring that the conjugate element $g\\sigma g^{-1}$ must be an element of $H$.\nSo, we must have $g\\sigma g^{-1} \\in \\{e, \\sigma\\}$.\n\nLet's consider the two possibilities for $g\\sigma g^{-1}$:\n1. Can $g\\sigma g^{-1} = e$? Multiplying by $g$ on the right and $g^{-1}$ on the left gives $\\sigma = g^{-1}eg = e$. This is false, since $\\sigma = (12)(34) \\neq e$.\n2. Therefore, the only possibility is $g\\sigma g^{-1} = \\sigma$.\n\nThis means an element $g$ is in the normalizer $N_{S_4}(H)$ if and only if it commutes with $\\sigma$. The set of all elements in a group that commute with a specific element is called the centralizer of that element. So, we are looking for the order of the centralizer of $\\sigma$ in $S_4$, denoted $C_{S_4}(\\sigma)$.\n$N_{S_4}(H) = C_{S_4}(\\sigma) = \\{g \\in S_4 \\mid g\\sigma = \\sigma g\\}$.\n\nTo find the order of the centralizer, we can use the orbit-stabilizer theorem for the group action of $S_4$ on itself by conjugation. For any element $x \\in S_4$, the theorem states:\n$|S_4| = |\\text{Orbit}(x)| \\cdot |\\text{Stabilizer}(x)|$.\nIn this context, the orbit of $x$ is its conjugacy class, and the stabilizer of $x$ is its centralizer $C_{S_4}(x)$.\nSo, $|C_{S_4}(\\sigma)| = \\frac{|S_4|}{|\\text{Conj}(\\sigma)|}$, where $\\text{Conj}(\\sigma)$ is the conjugacy class of $\\sigma$.\n\nThe order of $S_4$ is $|S_4| = 4! = 24$.\n\nThe conjugacy class of $\\sigma = (12)(34)$ consists of all permutations in $S_4$ with the same cycle structure. The cycle structure of $\\sigma$ is a product of two disjoint 2-cycles (transpositions). We need to count how many such permutations exist in $S_4$.\n\nTo construct such a permutation, we partition the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ into two subsets of size two.\n1. First, choose 2 elements for the first transposition out of 4. This can be done in $\\binom{4}{2}$ ways.\n2. The remaining 2 elements will form the second transposition, which can be done in $\\binom{2}{2}$ ways.\n3. However, the order of the two transpositions does not matter, i.e., $(12)(34)$ is the same permutation as $(34)(12)$. So, we must divide by 2! to correct for this overcounting.\n\nThe number of such permutations is:\n$$|\\text{Conj}(\\sigma)| = \\frac{1}{2!} \\binom{4}{2} \\binom{2}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 = 3.$$\nThe three permutations in this conjugacy class are $(12)(34)$, $(13)(24)$, and $(14)(23)$.\n\nNow we can calculate the order of the centralizer of $\\sigma$:\n$$|C_{S_4}(\\sigma)| = \\frac{|S_4|}{|\\text{Conj}(\\sigma)|} = \\frac{24}{3} = 8.$$\n\nSince we established that $N_{S_4}(H) = C_{S_4}(\\sigma)$, the order of the normalizer is:\n$$|N_{S_4}(H)| = |C_{S_4}(\\sigma)| = 8.$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "1632092"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice problem expands on the ideas we've developed by examining a subgroup within the larger symmetric group $S_5$.
