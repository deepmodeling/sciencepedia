The configuration with no links is also a valid configuration.\n\nA routine maintenance protocol, called a 'cyclic shift', is applied to the network.

Specifically, the role of server 1 is taken by server 2, server 2 by server 3, server 3 by server 4, and server 4 by server 1. For example, if a link initially exists between servers 1 and 3, after the cyclic shift, a link will exist between servers 2 and 4.\n\nA network configuration is called 'shift-invariant' if the set of connections after the cyclic shift is identical to the set of connections before the shift.
