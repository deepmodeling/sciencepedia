While $V = U_1 \\oplus U_2$ is a valid decomposition, $V = U_3 \\oplus U_4$ is not, because the spanning vectors for $U_3$ and $U_4$ are not eigenvectors of the representation matrices $\\rho(g)$.", "solution": "By hypothesis, for every $g \\in G$, the linear map is $\\rho(g)=I_{2}$. Therefore, for any subspace $U \\subseteq V$, we have for all $u \\in U$ and all $g \\in G$ that $\\rho(g)u=I_{2}u=u \\in U$. Hence every subspace of $V$ is $G$-invariant. In particular, every one-dimensional subspace is a subrepresentation.\n\nAn irreducible representation is one with no nontrivial proper invariant subspaces. Since there exist nontrivial proper invariant subspaces (indeed, all lines through the origin), $(\\rho,V)$ is reducible.

The matrix with these as columns has determinant\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1\\\\ 1 & -1\\end{pmatrix}=-2 \\neq 0,\n$$\nso they are linearly independent and $U_{3}\\cap U_{4}=\\{0\\}$ with $U_{3}+U_{4}=V$, giving $V=U_{3}\\oplus U_{4}$. Again, both subspaces are invariant because $\\rho(g)=I_{2}$ for all $g$, so this is also a valid decomposition into subrepresentations. Moreover, for every $g \\in G$ and every $v \\in V$, $\\rho(g)v=v$, so every nonzero vector is a common eigenvector of all $\\rho(g)$ with eigenvalue $1$. Thus the claim that $U_{3}$ and $U_{4}$ are not eigen-spanned contradicts the identity action, ruling out option E. Since there are many valid decompositions (indeed, any decomposition of $V$ into a direct sum of two lines), options A and D, which assert uniqueness of the specific listed decompositions, are false.\n\nFinally, uniqueness up to isomorphism is captured by character theory. The character of $(\\rho,V)$ is $\\chi(g)=\\mathrm{tr}(\\rho(g))=2$ for all $g \\in G$. If $\\chi_{\\mathrm{triv}}$ denotes the trivial character, $\\chi=2\\,\\chi_{\\mathrm{triv}}$.

Hence, as a $G$-module, $V \\cong 1_{G} \\oplus 1_{G}$, so the decomposition is unique up to isomorphism of the summands, but the specific invariant subspaces realizing this decomposition are not unique.
