A standard method to construct these separating sets involves the distance function.

We will analyze its compactness and Hausdorff property first, and then use the provided theorem to draw a conclusion about its normality.\n\nFirst, let's determine if $X$ is compact.\nLet $X = \\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\\}$ for some positive integer $n$, since $X$ is finite and non-empty. Let $\\mathcal{C} = \\{U_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha \\in I}$ be an arbitrary open cover of $X$. An open cover is a collection of open sets whose union is the entire space $X$. By the definition of an open cover, for each point $x_i \\in X$, there must be at least one open set in the collection $\\mathcal{C}$ that contains $x_i$. Let's pick one such set for each $x_i$ and call it $U_{\\alpha_i}$. Now, consider the subcollection $\\mathcal{C}' = \\{U_{\\alpha_1}, U_{\\alpha_2}, \\dots, U_{\\alpha_n}\\}$. This is a subcollection of $\\mathcal{C}$. The union of the sets in $\\mathcal{C}'$ is $\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} U_{\\alpha_i}$, which contains every point $x_i$ of $X$. Therefore, $\\mathcal{C}'$ is a subcover of $X$. Since $X$ is finite with $n$ elements, the subcover $\\mathcal{C}'$ contains at most $n$ sets, making it a finite subcover. Because we started with an arbitrary open cover and found a finite subcover, the space $X$ is compact by definition.\n\nSecond, let's determine if $X$ is Hausdorff.\nTo show $X$ is a Hausdorff space, we must take any two distinct points $x, y \\in X$ and find disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $x \\in U$ and $y \\in V$. In the discrete topology, every subset of $X$ is an open set. Let's consider the singleton sets $U = \\{x\\}$ and $V = \\{y\\}$. Since we are in the discrete topology, both $U$ and $V$ are open sets. It is clear that $x \\in U$ and $y \\in V$. Because $x$ and $y$ are distinct points, their corresponding singleton sets are disjoint, i.e., $U \\cap V = \\{x\\} \\cap \\{y\\} = \\emptyset$. Since this construction works for any pair of distinct points in $X$, the space $X$ is Hausdorff.\n\nFinally, we can use the provided theorem.\nWe have established that the space $X$ is both compact and Hausdorff. The problem statement gives the theorem: \"every compact Hausdorff space is also a normal space.\" Applying this theorem to our space $X$, we conclude that $X$ must be a normal space.\n\nNow we can evaluate the options:\nA) $X$ is compact, but it is not a Hausdorff space. This is false because we showed $X$ is Hausdorff.\nB) $X$ is a Hausdorff space, but it is not compact.

This is false because we showed $X$ is both compact and Hausdorff.\nD) $X$ is both compact and Hausdorff, and is therefore normal.

The space $X$ consists of two separate copies of $[0, 1]$, while $Y$ can be thought of as the interval $(0, 1]$ with two distinct \"origins\" $a$ and $b$. A natural approach is to map the two origins of $X$, which are the points $(0, 1)$ and $(0, 2)$, to the two origins of $Y$, namely $a$ and $b$. To ensure surjectivity, the remainder of both intervals in $X$ must map onto the interval $(0, 1]$ in $Y$. This suggests the following definition for $f(t, k)$, where $(t, k) \\in X$:\n$$\nf(t, k) = \\begin{cases}\n    t  \\text{if } t \\in (0, 1] \\\\\n    a  \\text{if } t = 0 \\text{ and } k=1 \\\\\n    b  \\text{if } t = 0 \\text{ and } k=2\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nLet's verify that this function has the required properties.\n\n1.  **Surjectivity**: We need to show that for every $y \\in Y$, there exists an $x \\in X$ such that $f(x) = y$.\n    - If $y \\in (0, 1]$, we can choose $x = (y, 1)$. Then $f(x) = f(y, 1) = y$.\n    - If $y = a$, we can choose $x = (0, 1)$. Then $f(x) = f(0, 1) = a$.\n    - If $y = b$, we can choose $x = (0, 2)$. Then $f(x) = f(0, 2) = b$.\n    Since every point in $Y$ is in the image of $f$, the function is surjective.\n\n2.  **Continuity**: We need to show that the preimage of any open set in $Y$ is open in $X$. It suffices to check this for the basis elements of the topology on $Y$.\n    - Case A: Let $V = (c, d)$ with $0  c  d \\le 1$.\n      $f^{-1}(V) = \\{(t, k) \\in X : f(t, k) \\in (c, d)\\} = \\{(t, k) \\in X : t \\in (c, d)\\}$.\n      This is the set $(c, d) \\times \\{1\\} \\cup (c, d) \\times \\{2\\}$. Since $(c, d)$ is open in $[0, 1]$, both $(c, d) \\times \\{1\\}$ and $(c, d) \\times \\{2\\}$ are open in their respective component spaces. Their union is thus open in the disjoint union space $X$.\n    - Case B: Let $V = (0, \\epsilon) \\cup \\{a\\}$ for some $0  \\epsilon \\le 1$.\n      $f^{-1}(V) = f^{-1}((0, \\epsilon)) \\cup f^{-1}(\\{a\\})$.\n      $f^{-1}((0, \\epsilon)) = \\{(t, k) \\in X : t \\in (0, \\epsilon)\\} = ((0, \\epsilon) \\times \\{1\\}) \\cup ((0, \\epsilon) \\times \\{2\\})$.\n      $f^{-1}(\\{a\\}) = \\{(0, 1)\\}$.\n      Thus, $f^{-1}(V) = ( [0, \\epsilon) \\times \\{1\\} ) \\cup ( (0, \\epsilon) \\times \\{2\\} )$. The intersection of this set with $[0,1]\\times\\{1\\}$ is $[0,\\epsilon)\\times\\{1\\}$ (open), and its intersection with $[0,1]\\times\\{2\\}$ is $(0,\\epsilon)\\times\\{2\\}$ (open). By definition of the disjoint union topology, the preimage is open in $X$.\n    - Case C: Let $V = (0, \\epsilon) \\cup \\{b\\}$ for some $0  \\epsilon \\le 1$.\n      By a similar argument, $f^{-1}(V) = ( (0, \\epsilon) \\times \\{1\\} ) \\cup ( [0, \\epsilon) \\times \\{2\\} )$. Its intersection with $[0,1]\\times\\{1\\}$ is $(0,\\epsilon)\\times\\{1\\}$ (open) and its intersection with $[0,1]\\times\\{2\\}$ is $[0,\\epsilon)\\times\\{2\\}$ (open), so the preimage is open in $X$.\n    Since the preimage of every basis element of $Y$ is open in $X$, the function $f$ is continuous.\n\n3.  **Openness**: We need to show that the image of any open set in $X$ is open in $Y$. It suffices to check this for the basis elements of the topology on $X$. A basis for $X$ is formed by sets of the type $U \\times \\{k\\}$, where $U$ is an open subset of $[0, 1]$ and $k \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n    - Case A: Let the open set in $X$ be $W = U \\times \\{1\\}$ for some open set $U \\subseteq [0, 1]$.\n        - Subcase A1: If $0 \\notin U$, then $U \\subseteq (0, 1]$. The image is $f(W) = f(U \\times \\{1\\}) = \\{t : t \\in U\\} = U$. Since $U$ is an open subset of $(0, 1]$, it is open in $Y$.\n        - Subcase A2: If $0 \\in U$, then since $U$ is open in $[0, 1]$, there must exist a $\\delta  0$ such that $[0, \\delta) \\subseteq U$. The image is $f(W) = f((U \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\times \\{1\\}) \\cup f(\\{(0, 1)\\}) = (U \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cup \\{a\\}$. To show this set is open in $Y$, consider any point $y$ in it. If $y \\in (U \\setminus \\{0\\})$, it is an interior point because $U \\setminus \\{0\\}$ is an open subset of $(0,1]$. If $y = a$, we know that $[0, \\delta) \\subseteq U$, so the image $f(W)$ contains $(0, \\delta) \\cup \\{a\\}$. This is a basis element in $Y$'s topology and is a neighborhood of $a$. Thus, every point in $f(W)$ has a neighborhood contained within $f(W)$, so $f(W)$ is open.\n    - Case B: Let the open set in $X$ be $W = U \\times \\{2\\}$ for some open set $U \\subseteq [0, 1]$. The argument is identical to Case A.\n        - If $0 \\notin U$, $f(W) = U$, which is open in $Y$.\n        - If $0 \\in U$, $f(W) = (U \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cup \\{b\\}$. Since $U$ contains some $[0, \\delta)$, $f(W)$ contains the neighborhood $(0, \\delta) \\cup \\{b\\}$ of $b$, making $f(W)$ an open set in $Y$.\n    Since the image of any basis element of $X$ is open in $Y$, the function $f$ is an open map.\n\nThe constructed function $f$ satisfies all three conditions: surjectivity, continuity, and openness.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{f(t, k) = \\begin{cases} t  \\text{if } t \\in (0, 1] \\\\ a  \\text{if } t = 0 \\text{ and } k=1 \\\\ b  \\text{if } t = 0 \\text{ and } k=2 \\end{cases}}\n$$", "id": "1564189"}]}
