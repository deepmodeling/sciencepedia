The equivalence classes are $H$ itself and singletons for points in $L:=\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}:y\\leq 0\\}$. Thus $Y$ consists of one point $h:=q(H)$ together with all points $q(p)$ for $p\\in L$, and the quotient topology on $Y$ satisfies: a set $U\\subset Y$ is open if and only if $q^{-1}(U)$ is open in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n\nFirst, characterize neighborhoods:\n- Since $q^{-1}(\\{h\\})=H$ and $H$ is open in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, it follows that $\\{h\\}$ is open in $Y$.\n- If $p\\in L$ with $y0$, there exists an open ball $B\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with $p\\in B\\subset\\{y0\\}$, hence $q^{-1}(q(B))=B$ (because $B$ is saturated) and $q(B)$ is an open neighborhood of $p$ in $Y$ that does not contain $h$.\n- If $p\\in L$ with $y=0$, then for any open $V\\subset Y$ with $p\\in V$, we have $q^{-1}(V)$ open in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $p\\in q^{-1}(V)$. Every open neighborhood of $p$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ intersects $H$, so $q^{-1}(V)\\cap H\\neq\\emptyset$. Since for any $x\\in H$ we have $q(x)=h$, this implies $h\\in V$. Therefore every neighborhood of a point on the $x$-axis contains $h$.\n\nNow check the separation properties.\n\n1) Not T1: In a T1 space, for any two distinct points $x,y$ there is an open set containing $x$ but not $y$. Take $p\\in L$ with $y=0$ and $h$. As shown above, every neighborhood of $p$ contains $h$, so there is no open set containing $p$ but not $h$. Hence $Y$ is not T1. Equivalently, singletons must be closed in a T1 space; here $q^{-1}(\\{h\\})=H$ is not closed in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, so $\\{h\\}$ is not closed in $Y$, again showing $Y$ is not T1.\n\n2) Not T2: If $Y$ were Hausdorff, then $p$ on the $x$-axis and $h$ would have disjoint neighborhoods. But any neighborhood of $p$ contains $h$, so no two disjoint neighborhoods exist for this pair. Therefore $Y$ is not T2.\n\n3) T0: For any two distinct points, there exists an open set containing one but not the other. Verify case by case:\n- If $p,q\\in\\{y0\\}$ with $p\\neq q$, choose disjoint open balls $B_{p},B_{q}\\subset\\{y0\\}$. Then $q(B_{p})$ and $q(B_{q})$ are disjoint open sets in $Y$, so in particular T0 holds.\n- If $p\\in\\{y0\\}$ and $q\\in L$ with $y=0$, choose an open ball $B\\subset\\{y0\\}$ with $p\\in B$ and $q\\notin B$. Then $q(B)$ is open in $Y$, contains $p$, and does not contain $q$, proving T0 for this pair.\n- If $p,q\\in L$ with $y=0$ and $p\\neq q$, choose an open ball $B$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ centered at $p$ small enough that $q\\notin B$. Define the saturated open set $O:=H\\cup B$, which is open in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and satisfies $q^{-1}(q(O))=O$. Then $U:=q(O)$ is open in $Y$, contains $p$, and does not contain $q$ (since $q\\notin O$), so T0 holds.\n- For the pair $(h,p)$ with any $p\\in L$, the open set $\\{h\\}$ contains $h$ and not $p$, so T0 holds.\n\nCombining these, $Y$ is T0 but not T1 (and hence not T2).

The space $(X, \\mathcal{T})$ fails to satisfy axiom $T_0$.", "solution": "To determine which separation axioms the space $(X, \\mathcal{T})$ satisfies, we will check them in order, starting from the weakest, $T_0$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for the $T_0$ axiom.**\nThe $T_0$ axiom requires that for any pair of distinct points $x, y \\in X$, there is an open set containing one but not the other. Let's consider all possible cases for the pair of points $(x, y)$.\n\nCase 1: $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. The topology on $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ as a subspace of $X$ is the standard Euclidean topology. The real line is Hausdorff, so for any two distinct points, we can find an open interval around $x$ that does not contain $y$. This interval is open in $X$. Thus, the axiom holds for this case.\n\nCase 2: One point is an origin, say $x=p$, and the other is a real point, $y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. By the definition of the topology on $X$, a basic open neighborhood of $p$ is of the form $U = (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\cup \\{p\\}$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$. If we choose $\\epsilon$ to be smaller than $|y|$, for example $\\epsilon = |y|/2$, then $y \\notin U$. The set $U$ is open, contains $p$, but does not contain $y$. Thus, the axiom holds. The same logic applies if the origin is $q$.\n\nCase 3: The two points are the two origins, $x=p$ and $y=q$. Consider the basic open neighborhood of $p$ given by $U = (-1, 1) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\cup \\{p\\}$. By definition, $p \\in U$. The point $q$ is not in $U$ because $q$ is distinct from $p$ and from all points in $(-1, 1) \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Thus, we have found an open set containing $p$ but not $q$.\n\nSince in all cases we can find an open set containing one point but not the other, the space $(X, \\mathcal{T})$ is a $T_0$ space. This eliminates option D.\n\n**Step 2: Check for the $T_1$ axiom.**\nThe $T_1$ axiom is stronger than $T_0$. It requires that for any distinct points $x, y$, we can find an open set containing $x$ but not $y$ AND an open set containing $y$ but not $x$.\n\nCase 1: $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. As before, the standard topology on $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ is $T_2$ and therefore $T_1$. We can find disjoint open intervals around $x$ and $y$.\n\nCase 2: $x=p$ and $y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. In Step 1, we found an open set $U$ containing $p$ but not $y$. Now we need an open set $V$ containing $y$ but not $p$. Let's take $V$ to be a small open interval around $y$, for example, $V = (y - |y|/2, y + |y|/2)$. This interval does not contain $0$, so by condition 1 in the problem description, it is an open set in $X$. It contains $y$ but clearly does not contain $p$. The same argument holds for $x=q$.\n\nCase 3: $x=p$ and $y=q$. In Step 1, we found an open set $U = (-1, 1) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\cup \\{p\\}$ that contains $p$ but not $q$. By symmetry, the set $V = (-1, 1) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\cup \\{q\\}$ is an open set containing $q$ but not $p$.\n\nSince for every pair of distinct points the condition holds, the space $(X, \\mathcal{T})$ is a $T_1$ space. This eliminates option A.\n\n**Step 3: Check for the $T_2$ (Hausdorff) axiom.**\nThe $T_2$ axiom requires that for any pair of distinct points $x, y \\in X$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $x \\in U$ and $y \\in V$. We only need to find one pair of points that cannot be separated for the space to fail this axiom. The most likely candidates are the two origins, $p$ and $q$.\n\nLet $x=p$ and $y=q$. Let $U$ be any open set containing $p$, and $V$ be any open set containing $q$.\nAccording to the definition of the topology:\n- Since $p \\in U$, there must exist some $\\epsilon > 0$ such that the basic open set $B_p = (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\cup \\{p\\}$ is contained in $U$.\n- Since $q \\in V$, there must exist some $\\delta > 0$ such that the basic open set $B_q = (-\\delta, \\delta) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\cup \\{q\\}$ is contained in $V$.\n\nNow let's examine the intersection of these basic open sets:\n$$B_p \\cap B_q = ((-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\cup \\{p\\}) \\cap ((-\\delta, \\delta) \\setminus \\{0\\} \\cup \\{q\\})$$\nSince $p \\neq q$ and neither are in the real numbers, this simplifies to:\n$$B_p \\cap B_q = ((-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cap ((-\\delta, \\delta) \\setminus \\{0\\})$$\nLet $\\eta = \\min(\\epsilon, \\delta)$. Since $\\epsilon > 0$ and $\\delta > 0$, we have $\\eta > 0$. The intersection is then $(-\\eta, \\eta) \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\nThis set is never empty. For instance, the point $\\eta/2$ is in this intersection.\n\nSince $B_p \\subseteq U$ and $B_q \\subseteq V$, their non-empty intersection implies that $U \\cap V$ is also non-empty. Therefore, it is impossible to find disjoint open sets containing $p$ and $q$.\nThe space $(X, \\mathcal{T})$ is not a $T_2$ (Hausdorff) space. This eliminates option C.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe space $(X, \\mathcal{T})$ satisfies the $T_1$ axiom but fails to satisfy the $T_2$ axiom.
