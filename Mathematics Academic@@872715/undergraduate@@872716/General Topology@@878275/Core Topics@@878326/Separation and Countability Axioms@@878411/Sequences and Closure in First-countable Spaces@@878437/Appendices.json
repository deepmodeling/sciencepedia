Suppose $\\mathbf{p}_n = (x_n,y_n) \\to \\mathbf{p} = (x,y)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The coordinate projections $\\pi_{1}(x,y)=x$ and $\\pi_{2}(x,y)=y$ are continuous, so $\\pi_{1}(\\mathbf{p}_n) \\to \\pi_{1}(\\mathbf{p})$ and $\\pi_{2}(\\mathbf{p}_n) \\to \\pi_{2}(\\mathbf{p})$, i.e., $x_n \\to x$ and $y_n \\to y$. Conversely, if $x_n \\to x$ and $y_n \\to y$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, let $U=(a,b)\\times(c,d)$ be any basic open neighborhood of $(x,y)$. Then there exist $N_{1},N_{2} \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $nN_{1}$, $x_n \\in (a,b)$, and for all $nN_{2}$, $y_n \\in (c,d)$. For $n  \\max\\{N_{1},N_{2}\\}$, we have $\\mathbf{p}_n \\in U$. Since rectangles form a basis, this proves $\\mathbf{p}_n \\to \\mathbf{p}$.

Conversely, assume $x_{n,i} \\to x_{i}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ for every $i \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Let $U=\\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty} U_{i}$ be a basic open neighborhood of $\\mathbf{x}$ with $U_{i}=\\mathbb{R}$ for all but finitely many $i$; let $F \\subset \\mathbb{N}$ be the finite set of indices where $U_{i} \\neq \\mathbb{R}$. For each $i \\in F$, choose $N_{i}$ such that for all $nN_{i}$, $x_{n,i} \\in U_{i}$. Let $N=\\max\\{N_{i}: i \\in F\\}$.

Coordinatewise convergence is necessary (by continuity of projections) but not sufficient. Consider the counterexample where $\\mathbf{x}=(0,0,0,\\dots)$ and a sequence $\\mathbf{x}_n=(x_{n,1},x_{n,2},\\dots)$ is defined by $x_{n,i} = 1/n$ for all $i$. For each fixed $i$, the sequence of components is $(1, 1/2, 1/3, \\dots)$, which converges to $0=x_i$. Thus the component sequences converge. Now consider the basic open set in the box topology\n$$\nU=\\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\tfrac{1}{i},\\tfrac{1}{i}\\right),\n$$\nwhich contains $\\mathbf{x}$. For any $n$, for the point $\\mathbf{x}_n$ to be in $U$, we must have $x_{n,i} = 1/n \\in (-1/i, 1/i)$ for all $i$. This is not true; if we choose $i=n$, the condition becomes $1/n \\in (-1/n, 1/n)$, which is false. Therefore, for each $n$, the point $\\mathbf{x}_n$ is not in $U$. This means the sequence $\\mathbf{x}_n$ does not converge to $\\mathbf{x}$ in the box topology. This shows the “if and only if” claim fails, so Statement III is false. A different counterexample is to define\n$$\nx_{n,i}=\n\\begin{cases}\n0,  i \\leq n, \\\\\n1,  i  n.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFor each fixed $i$, if $n \\geq i$ then $x_{n,i}=0$, so $x_{n,i} \\to 0=x_{i}$. Thus the component sequences converge. Consider the basic open set in the box topology\n$$\nU=\\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right),\n$$\nwhich contains $\\mathbf{x}$. For every $n$, there exists $in$ with $x_{n,i}=1 \\notin \\left(-\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)$, hence $\\mathbf{x}_n \\notin U$ for all $n$. Therefore $\\mathbf{x}_n$ does not converge to $\\mathbf{x}$ in the box topology.
