This first practice explores the most fundamental example of a non-T0 space: any set endowed with the indiscrete topology.

Let $\\mathcal{U}$ be an open cover of $X$, so $X\\subseteq \\bigcup_{U\\in\\mathcal{U}}U$ and each $U\\in\\mathcal{U}$ lies in $\\tau$. Since the only open sets are $\\emptyset$ and $X$, any union of members of $\\mathcal{U}$ equals $X$ only if $X\\in\\mathcal{U}$ (unions of $\\emptyset$ are $\\emptyset$).

We must check all pairs of distinct points:\n    -   For $(1, 2)$: The open set $\\{1\\}$ contains 1 but not 2.\n    -   For $(1, 3)$: The open set $\\{1\\}$ contains 1 but not 3.\n    -   For $(1, 4)$: The open set $\\{1\\}$ contains 1 but not 4.\n    -   For $(2, 3)$: The open set $\\{1, 3\\}$ contains 3 but not 2.\n    -   For $(2, 4)$: The open set $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ contains 2 but not 4.\n    -   For $(3, 4)$: The open set $\\{1, 3\\}$ contains 3 but not 4.\n    Since every pair of distinct points can be separated by an open set, the space is T0.\n-   **Is it connected?** Yes. To check for connectedness, we can find the closed sets, which are the complements of the open sets:\n    -   Closed sets: $X, \\{2, 3, 4\\}, \\{2, 4\\}, \\{4\\}, \\emptyset$.\n    The only sets that are in both the list of open sets and the list of closed sets are $\\emptyset$ and $X$.

Both of these sets also contain point $2$.\n    -   The open sets containing point $2$ are $\\{1, 2\\}$ and $X$. Both of these sets also contain point $1$.\n    -   There is no open set that contains one of these points but not the other. Therefore, the space is **not** T0. The points $1$ and $2$ are topologically indistinguishable.\n-   **Is it connected?** Yes. We list the open sets and their corresponding closed sets (complements):\n    -   Open sets: $\\emptyset, \\{1, 2\\}, X$.\n    -   Closed sets: $X, \\{3, 4\\}, \\emptyset$.\n    The only sets that are both open and closed are $\\emptyset$ and $X$.

The same applies to points $3$ and $4$. Thus, the space is **not** T0.\n-   **Is it connected?** No. Let $U = \\{1, 2\\}$ and $V = \\{3, 4\\}$. Both $U$ and $V$ are non-empty sets in the topology $\\tau_D$. They are disjoint ($U \\cap V = \\emptyset$) and their union is the entire space ($U \\cup V = X$). By definition, the existence of such a partition of $X$ into two non-empty disjoint open sets means the space is not connected.\n-   **Conclusion for D:** This space is not T0 and not connected.
