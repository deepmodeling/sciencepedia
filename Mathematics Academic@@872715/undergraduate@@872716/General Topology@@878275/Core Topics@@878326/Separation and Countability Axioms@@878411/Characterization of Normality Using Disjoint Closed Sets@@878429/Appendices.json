A space is a **$T_1$ space** if for every pair of distinct points $x, y$, there is an open set containing $x$ but not $y$.

Therefore, it is impossible to find two *non-empty* closed sets that are disjoint. This means that the condition for normality is vacuously satisfied for all non-empty closed sets, which implies that the space is normal.\"\n\n**Claim 2:** \"The space $(X, \\tau)$ is not a $T_1$ space, because for any point $x \\in X$, the singleton set $\\{x\\}$ is not a closed set.

The closed sets are complements of open sets, so the only closed sets are $\\emptyset$ and $X$.\n\nTo check normality, recall: a space is normal if for every pair of disjoint closed sets $A,B$ there exist disjoint open sets $U,V$ with $A\\subseteq U$ and $B\\subseteq V$. The only disjoint pairs of closed sets are $(\\emptyset,\\emptyset)$, $(\\emptyset,X)$, and $(X,\\emptyset)$.

The student correctly observes that the only non-empty closed set is $X$, hence there are no two disjoint non-empty closed sets. They conclude normality by a vacuity argument restricted to non-empty closed sets. This reasoning is incomplete because the definition quantifies over all disjoint closed sets, including cases where one is empty. However, as shown above, the empty-set cases are easily handled, and the space is indeed normal. Therefore, the conclusion is correct though the reasoning is incomplete.\n\nEvaluate Claim 2. The space is not $T_{1}$: for distinct $x,y\\in X$, there is no open set containing $x$ but not $y$ because the only open sets are $\\emptyset$ and $X$, and singletons $\\{x\\}$ are not closed when $|X|\\geq 2$. However, concluding that the space is not normal from not being $T_{1}$ is a logical error. A $T_{4}$ space is, by definition, both normal and $T_{1}$, so $T_{4}\\Rightarrow$ normal and $T_{4}\\Rightarrow T_{1}$, but normal does not imply $T_{1}$. From not $T_{1}$ one can only infer not $T_{4}$, not the failure of normality. Since we have already established normality, the conclusion of Claim 2 is false and conflates normal with $T_{4}$.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate assessment is that Claim 1’s reasoning is incomplete but its conclusion is correct, and Claim 2’s conclusion is incorrect for conflating properties.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1535761"}, {"introduction": "To truly appreciate a topological property, it is essential to study cases where it does not hold.
