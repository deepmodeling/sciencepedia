## Introduction
In the study of topology, the [separation axioms](@entry_id:154482) provide a framework for [classifying spaces](@entry_id:148422) based on how well points and sets can be distinguished from one another. While the Hausdorff condition ensures that any two distinct points have separate open neighborhoods, a more refined question arises: can we separate a point from a [closed set](@entry_id:136446) that does not contain it? This question leads to the concept of **regular spaces**, a property that adds a crucial layer of structure and "reasonableness" to a [topological space](@entry_id:149165). This article bridges the gap between the intuitive idea of separation and its formal topological consequences. In the following chapters, you will first master the foundational principles of regularity, including its formal definition, an equivalent characterization involving neighborhoods, and its precise position within the [hierarchy of separation axioms](@entry_id:152673). Next, you will discover the wide-ranging applications of this concept, from its inherent presence in all [metric spaces](@entry_id:138860) to its role in advanced [metrization theorems](@entry_id:149834) and its connections to fields like [functional analysis](@entry_id:146220). Finally, a series of hands-on problems will allow you to apply these concepts and sharpen your topological intuition.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In our exploration of [topological spaces](@entry_id:155056), we have encountered the Hausdorff condition, which guarantees that any two distinct points can be isolated within disjoint open neighborhoods. This axiom provides a foundational level of "separateness." We now ascend to a higher level of distinction by considering not just the separation of points from other points, but the separation of points from closed sets. This leads to the concept of **regularity**, a property that refines our classification of [topological spaces](@entry_id:155056) and is intimately connected to [metrizability](@entry_id:154239) and other desirable characteristics.

### The Definition of Regularity

The intuitive idea behind regularity is the ability to place a "buffer" of open space between a point and a closed set that does not contain it. This ensures that the point is not "infinitesimally close" to the set in a topological sense.

A [topological space](@entry_id:149165) $X$ is defined as a **[regular space](@entry_id:155336)** if, for every [closed set](@entry_id:136446) $C \subset X$ and any point $p \in X \setminus C$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $p \in U$ and $C \subseteq V$.

It is common practice in topology to combine regularity with the $T_1$ axiom. A **T3 space** is defined as a [topological space](@entry_id:149165) that is both regular and $T_1$. Recall that a space is $T_1$ if and only if every singleton set $\{x\}$ is closed. The requirement of the $T_1$ axiom ensures that points themselves are closed entities, which makes the act of separating a point from another [closed set](@entry_id:136446) a very natural and consistent notion. Throughout this chapter, when discussing the relationship between regularity and other [separation axioms](@entry_id:154482), we will often assume the space is $T_1$ and explicitly refer to it as a T3 space.

To make this abstract definition more concrete, consider the familiar Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ with its usual topology. Let's demonstrate its regularity for a specific case. Let the point be $p = (0, 1)$ and the [closed set](@entry_id:136446) be the x-axis, $C = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid y=0\}$. The point $p$ is clearly not in the set $C$. To satisfy the definition of regularity, we must find two [disjoint open sets](@entry_id:150704), one containing $p$ and the other containing $C$.

Consider the two horizontal open half-planes:
$U = \{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid y > 1/2 \}$
$V = \{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid y  1/2 \}$

These sets are open in the usual topology. The point $p=(0,1)$ is in $U$ since $1  1/2$. Every point $(x,0)$ in the set $C$ is in $V$ since $0  1/2$, so $C \subseteq V$. Finally, the sets are disjoint, as there is no point $(x,y)$ for which $y$ is simultaneously greater than $1/2$ and less than $1/2$. Thus, $U \cap V = \varnothing$. This construction successfully separates the point $p$ from the [closed set](@entry_id:136446) $C$, illustrating the principle of regularity [@problem_id:1570369]. It's a valuable exercise to consider why other potential choices for $U$ and $V$ might fail; for instance, they might not be disjoint, or one of them might not be an open set.

### An Equivalent Characterization of Regularity

While the definitional separation of a point and a [closed set](@entry_id:136446) is geometrically intuitive, an alternative characterization involving neighborhoods often proves more versatile in theoretical proofs. This equivalent condition reframes regularity as a property of how neighborhoods are structured around each point.

A [topological space](@entry_id:149165) $X$ is regular if and only if for every point $x \in X$ and every open neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there exists an open neighborhood $V$ of $x$ such that the closure of $V$, denoted $\overline{V}$, is contained within $U$ (i.e., $\overline{V} \subseteq U$).

This condition asserts that any [open neighborhood](@entry_id:268496) $U$ of a point $x$ can be "shrunk" to a smaller open neighborhood $V$ whose closure is still contained within the original neighborhood $U$. This guarantees a kind of "cushion" or "buffer zone" between the boundary of the smaller neighborhood and the boundary of the larger one.

Let us prove this equivalence for any topological space $X$ [@problem_id:1672469].

($\Rightarrow$) Assume $X$ is regular. Let $x \in X$ and let $U$ be an [open neighborhood](@entry_id:268496) of $x$. Consider the set $C = X \setminus U$. Since $U$ is open, $C$ is a closed set. By construction, $x \notin C$. By the definition of regularity, there exist disjoint open sets $V$ and $W$ such that $x \in V$ and $C \subseteq W$. The disjointness of $V$ and $W$ means $V \subseteq X \setminus W$. Since $W$ is open, its complement $X \setminus W$ is closed. Therefore, the closure of $V$ must be contained in this closed set: $\overline{V} \subseteq X \setminus W$. Furthermore, since $C \subseteq W$, we have $X \setminus W \subseteq X \setminus C = U$. Combining these inclusions, we get $\overline{V} \subseteq X \setminus W \subseteq U$, which shows that $\overline{V} \subseteq U$.

($\Leftarrow$) Now assume the neighborhood-closure condition holds. Let $C$ be a [closed set](@entry_id:136446) and $p$ be a point such that $p \notin C$. The set $U = X \setminus C$ is an [open neighborhood](@entry_id:268496) of $p$. By our assumption, there exists an open neighborhood $V$ of $p$ such that $\overline{V} \subseteq U$. Now, let us define a second set, $W = X \setminus \overline{V}$. Since $\overline{V}$ is a closed set, $W$ is an open set. We must check that $V$ and $W$ satisfy the conditions for regularity.
1. $p \in V$ by construction.
2. $C \subseteq W$: From $\overline{V} \subseteq U = X \setminus C$, we can take complements to get $C \subseteq X \setminus \overline{V} = W$.
3. $V \cap W = \varnothing$: This is true by definition, as $W$ is the [complement of a set](@entry_id:146296), $\overline{V}$, which contains $V$.
Thus, we have found [disjoint open sets](@entry_id:150704) $V$ and $W$ separating $p$ and $C$.

This equivalence is a powerful tool, as it allows us to prove regularity by examining the local neighborhood structure, which can be simpler than constructing separating sets for arbitrary points and closed sets.

### The Position of Regularity in the Separation Axiom Hierarchy

The [separation axioms](@entry_id:154482) form a ladder of increasingly strong conditions. Understanding where regularity sits on this ladder is crucial for [classifying spaces](@entry_id:148422) and appreciating the implications of this property.

A key relationship connects T3 spaces (T1 and regular) to Hausdorff (T2) spaces. While it may seem that the Hausdorff property is a prerequisite for regularity, the hierarchy is more nuanced.
- A **T3 space is always a Hausdorff space**. To see this, let $X$ be a T3 space and let $x, y$ be distinct points. Since $X$ is T1, the singleton set $\{y\}$ is closed. Since $x \neq y$, we have $x \notin \{y\}$. We can now apply the regularity condition to separate the point $x$ from the [closed set](@entry_id:136446) $\{y\}$. There exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $x \in U$ and $\{y\} \subseteq V$. This is precisely the definition of a Hausdorff space.

However, the converse is not true. A Hausdorff space is not necessarily regular.
- A classic [counterexample](@entry_id:148660) is the space $(\mathbb{R}, \tau)$ where the topology $\tau$ is generated by the basis of standard open intervals $(a,b)$ along with sets of the form $(a,b) \setminus K$, where $K = \{1/n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}, n \ge 1\}$ [@problem_id:1570392]. This space is Hausdorff because its topology is finer than the standard Euclidean topology on $\mathbb{R}$ (which is Hausdorff). However, it is not regular. The set $K$ is closed in this topology, and the point $0$ is not in $K$. It can be shown that it is impossible to find disjoint open sets separating $0$ and $K$. Any [open neighborhood](@entry_id:268496) of $0$ must intersect any [open neighborhood](@entry_id:268496) of $K$.

Similarly, being T1 is not sufficient to guarantee regularity.
- Consider the set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ with the **[cofinite topology](@entry_id:138582)**, where a set is open if it is empty or its complement is finite. This space is T1, as for any two integers $m \neq n$, the set $\mathbb{Z} \setminus \{n\}$ is an open set containing $m$ but not $n$. However, this space is not regular [@problem_id:1570351]. A key feature of this topology on an infinite set is that any two non-empty open sets have a non-empty intersection. If $U_1$ and $U_2$ are non-empty and open, their complements $X \setminus U_1$ and $X \setminus U_2$ are finite. The complement of their intersection is $(U_1 \cap U_2)^c = (X \setminus U_1) \cup (X \setminus U_2)$, which is a finite union of [finite sets](@entry_id:145527) and thus finite. Since $X$ is infinite, $U_1 \cap U_2$ cannot be empty. Therefore, it is impossible to find [disjoint open sets](@entry_id:150704) to separate any point from any non-empty closed set not containing it.

Regularity also fits neatly between two other important separation properties: complete regularity and normality.
- A space is **completely regular** (or Tychonoff, or $T_{3.5}$) if it is T1 and for every [closed set](@entry_id:136446) $F$ and point $x \notin F$, there is a continuous function $f: X \to [0, 1]$ with $f(x)=0$ and $f(y)=1$ for all $y \in F$. **Every [completely regular space](@entry_id:151585) is regular** [@problem_id:1540261]. The continuous function provides a direct way to construct the separating sets. Given $f$, let $U = f^{-1}([0, 1/2))$ and $V = f^{-1}((1/2, 1])$. Since $[0, 1/2)$ and $(1/2, 1]$ are disjoint open subsets of $[0, 1]$, and $f$ is continuous, their preimages $U$ and $V$ are disjoint open subsets of $X$. Clearly $x \in U$ and $F \subseteq V$, satisfying the regularity condition. The converse is not true; there exist regular spaces that are not completely regular.
- A space is **normal** (or $T_4$, when combined with T1) if any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by [disjoint open sets](@entry_id:150704). **Every T1 and [normal space](@entry_id:154487) is regular** [@problem_id:1570388]. This follows directly from the definitions. If $X$ is T1 and normal, let $C$ be a [closed set](@entry_id:136446) and $p$ a point not in $C$. Since $X$ is T1, the singleton $\{p\}$ is a [closed set](@entry_id:136446). We now have two [disjoint closed sets](@entry_id:152178), $\{p\}$ and $C$. By normality, there exist [disjoint open sets](@entry_id:150704) $U$ and $V$ such that $\{p\} \subseteq U$ and $C \subseteq V$. This is exactly the definition of regularity.

The hierarchy can be summarized (for T1 spaces) as:
Compact Hausdorff ⇒ Normal ($T_4$) ⇒ Completely Regular ($T_{3.5}$) ⇒ Regular ($T_3$) ⇒ Hausdorff ($T_2$) ⇒ $T_1$.

### Important Classes of Regular Spaces

While counterexamples are illuminating, it is equally important to identify broad and useful classes of spaces that are guaranteed to be regular.

A cornerstone result is that **every metric space is regular**. Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. Let $C$ be a closed set in $X$ and $p$ a point not in $C$. Since $C$ is closed, the distance from $p$ to $C$, defined as $r = \inf\{d(p, c) \mid c \in C\}$, is strictly positive. Let's choose our separating open sets based on this distance. Consider the [open ball](@entry_id:141481) $U = B(p, r/2)$ centered at $p$ with radius $r/2$. For the set $C$, we can take the union of [open balls](@entry_id:143668) of the same radius around each of its points: $V = \bigcup_{c \in C} B(c, r/2)$. Both $U$ and $V$ are open sets, $p \in U$, and $C \subseteq V$. To see that they are disjoint, suppose there were a point $z \in U \cap V$. Then $d(p, z)  r/2$, and for some $c \in C$, $d(z, c)  r/2$. By the triangle inequality, $d(p, c) \le d(p, z) + d(z, c)  r/2 + r/2 = r$. This contradicts the definition of $r$ as the [infimum](@entry_id:140118) of distances from $p$ to points in $C$. Therefore, $U$ and $V$ must be disjoint. This proves that all [metric spaces](@entry_id:138860), including Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$ and the space of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ [@problem_id:1589267], are regular.

Another powerful theorem connects regularity to compactness. **Every compact Hausdorff space is regular** [@problem_id:1556902]. Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space, $C$ a closed subset, and $p \notin C$. The key is to use the Hausdorff property to create local separations and then use compactness to stitch them together into a global separation.
1. For each point $x \in C$, since $X$ is Hausdorff and $p \neq x$, there exist disjoint open sets $U_x$ and $V_x$ with $p \in U_x$ and $x \in V_x$.
2. The collection $\{V_x \mid x \in C\}$ forms an open cover of the set $C$. Since $X$ is compact and $C$ is a closed subset, $C$ is also compact.
3. By the compactness of $C$, there exists a [finite subcover](@entry_id:155054), say $\{V_{x_1}, V_{x_2}, \dots, V_{x_n}\}$, such that $C \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^n V_{x_i}$.
4. Now we construct our final separating sets. Let $U = \bigcap_{i=1}^n U_{x_i}$ and $V = \bigcup_{i=1}^n V_{x_i}$.
As a [finite intersection of open sets](@entry_id:193463), $U$ is open. As a finite union of open sets, $V$ is open. We have $p \in U$ (since $p$ is in every $U_{x_i}$) and $C \subseteq V$. Finally, $U$ and $V$ are disjoint. For any $z \in V$, $z$ must be in some $V_{x_k}$. But $U \subseteq U_{x_k}$, and by construction $U_{x_k} \cap V_{x_k} = \varnothing$. Therefore, $z$ cannot be in $U$. This completes the proof.

### Properties and Operations on Regular Spaces

Finally, we examine how regularity behaves under standard topological constructions such as taking subspaces, products, and quotients.

**Subspaces:** Regularity is a **[hereditary property](@entry_id:151340)**, meaning that any subspace of a [regular space](@entry_id:155336) is also regular. Let $X$ be a [regular space](@entry_id:155336) and $Y \subseteq X$ be a subspace. Let $p \in Y$ and let $C_Y$ be a closed set in $Y$ with $p \notin C_Y$. By the definition of the subspace topology, $C_Y = C_X \cap Y$ for some closed set $C_X$ in $X$. Since $p \in Y$ and $p \notin C_Y$, it must be that $p \notin C_X$. Because $X$ is regular, there exist disjoint open sets $U_X$ and $V_X$ in $X$ such that $p \in U_X$ and $C_X \subseteq V_X$. Now consider the sets $U_Y = U_X \cap Y$ and $V_Y = V_X \cap Y$. These are open in the subspace topology on $Y$. We have $p \in U_Y$, and $C_Y = C_X \cap Y \subseteq V_X \cap Y = V_Y$. Furthermore, since $U_X$ and $V_X$ are disjoint, so are $U_Y$ and $V_Y$. Thus, $Y$ is a [regular space](@entry_id:155336).

**Products:** Regularity is well-behaved with respect to products. A product space $\prod X_\alpha$ is regular if and only if each factor space $X_\alpha$ is regular [@problem_id:1569430]. This is an extremely powerful theorem because it allows us to construct complex regular spaces from simpler ones. For instance, if we know that the closed interval $[0,1]$ (a compact Hausdorff space) and the Sorgenfrey line $\mathbb{R}_l$ are both regular, we can immediately conclude that their product $[0,1] \times \mathbb{R}_l$ is also regular. Conversely, if one of the factor spaces is not regular, the entire product space will fail to be regular. For example, the product of the [regular space](@entry_id:155336) $[0,1]$ with the non-regular [cofinite topology](@entry_id:138582) on $\mathbb{R}$ is not regular.

**Quotients:** In stark contrast to products and subspaces, regularity is **not** generally preserved by quotient maps. A quotient of a [regular space](@entry_id:155336) may fail to be regular. This is a crucial point of caution. For example, while the real line $\mathbb{R}$ is regular (it's a metric space), it is possible to define an [equivalence relation](@entry_id:144135) on it whose quotient space is not even T1, let alone regular.

However, some specific quotients of regular spaces do turn out to be regular, but this requires a dedicated analysis, not the application of a general theorem. Consider the space $Y = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$, formed by identifying all integers in $\mathbb{R}$ to a single point [@problem_id:1570381]. This space is, in fact, regular. The reason is that $Y$ is homeomorphic to the unit circle $S^1$ in the complex plane (via the map $[x] \mapsto \exp(2\pi i x)$). Since $S^1$ is a compact Hausdorff subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$, it is regular. Therefore, $Y$ is regular by virtue of being homeomorphic to a known [regular space](@entry_id:155336). The regularity of $\mathbb{R}$ is not the direct reason for the regularity of its quotient $Y$.
