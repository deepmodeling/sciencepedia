## Introduction
In the study of topology, the [separation axioms](@entry_id:154482) provide a crucial framework for [classifying spaces](@entry_id:148422) based on their ability to distinguish points and sets. While the Hausdorff (T2) property is fundamental, many areas of mathematics require a stronger degree of separation. This leads us to the concept of **regularity**, a property that ensures points can be neatly separated from [closed sets](@entry_id:137168). However, the initial definition, while intuitive, is not always the most efficient tool for constructing proofs or understanding the deeper structure of these spaces.

This article bridges that gap by moving beyond the basic definition to explore more powerful and practical equivalent characterizations of regularity. We will uncover how this property is fundamentally linked to the interplay between open sets, neighborhoods, and their closures. By developing these alternative perspectives, you will gain a more robust toolkit for analyzing [topological spaces](@entry_id:155056).

Across the following chapters, you will embark on a comprehensive exploration of this concept. The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, establishes the foundational equivalences of regularity, particularly the "squeezing" property involving neighborhood [closures](@entry_id:747387), and situates it within the broader [separation axiom](@entry_id:155057) hierarchy. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, demonstrates the utility of regularity by examining its behavior in a diverse range of spaces—from [metric spaces](@entry_id:138860) and [function spaces](@entry_id:143478) to the Sorgenfrey line and quotient constructions—and touches upon its connections to fields like algebraic geometry. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** will provide you with the opportunity to apply these principles to concrete problems, solidifying your understanding of this essential topological property.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Following our introduction to the [separation axioms](@entry_id:154482), we now undertake a more detailed investigation of regularity. While the initial definition provides a clear picture of separating points from [closed sets](@entry_id:137168), its true utility in topological proofs is unlocked through several powerful and elegant equivalent characterizations. This chapter will develop these characterizations, place regularity within the broader hierarchy of [topological properties](@entry_id:154666), and explore its behavior with respect to standard topological constructions.

### Foundational Definitions and Equivalences

A [topological space](@entry_id:149165) is traditionally called **regular** if for any [closed set](@entry_id:136446) $F$ and any point $p$ not in $F$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $p \in U$ and $F \subseteq V$. In modern usage, the term **T3 space** is reserved for a space that is both regular and a T1 space. Recall that a space is T1 if and only if all of its singleton sets are closed. This T1 condition is not redundant; it is essential for many of the desirable consequences of regularity. Throughout this chapter, unless stated otherwise, we will assume our spaces are T1 and focus on the regularity condition itself.

The definition of regularity is specified in terms of open sets. However, it can be immediately and equivalently reframed using the more general concept of neighborhoods. A set $N$ is a neighborhood of a point or a set if it contains an open set that in turn contains the point or set.

This leads to our first equivalent characterization of regularity, which is often more flexible. A T1 space $X$ is regular if and only if for every point $p \in X$ and every [closed set](@entry_id:136446) $F \subseteq X$ with $p \notin F$, there exists a neighborhood $N_p$ of $p$ and a neighborhood $N_F$ of $F$ such that $N_p \cap N_F = \emptyset$ [@problem_id:1563549].

The proof of this equivalence is straightforward. If the space is regular, the [disjoint open sets](@entry_id:150704) $U$ and $V$ from the original definition serve as the required disjoint neighborhoods. Conversely, if disjoint neighborhoods $N_p$ and $N_F$ exist, then by the definition of a neighborhood, there must exist open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $p \in U \subseteq N_p$ and $F \subseteq V \subseteq N_F$. Since $N_p$ and $N_F$ are disjoint, their subsets $U$ and $V$ must also be disjoint, satisfying the original definition.

### The Power of Closures: The Neighborhood-Closure Characterizations

While the neighborhood-based definition provides flexibility, the most potent characterizations of regularity involve the interplay between neighborhoods and their closures. These formulations are central to proving many important theorems about [regular spaces](@entry_id:154729).

The first of these characterizations states that a T1 space $X$ is regular if and only if for every point $x \in X$ and every [closed set](@entry_id:136446) $F \subseteq X$ with $x \notin F$, there exists an [open neighborhood](@entry_id:268496) $U$ of $x$ such that its closure $\overline{U}$ is disjoint from $F$ [@problem_id:1536007]. This means we can find a "buffer zone" around the neighborhood of $x$ that still does not touch the set $F$.

Let's see why this is equivalent to regularity.
*   ($\Rightarrow$) Assume $X$ is regular. For a point $x$ and a disjoint closed set $F$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ with $x \in U$ and $F \subseteq V$. Since $U$ and $V$ are disjoint, $U$ is contained in the complement of $V$, which is the [closed set](@entry_id:136446) $X \setminus V$. The closure $\overline{U}$ is the smallest [closed set](@entry_id:136446) containing $U$, so we must have $\overline{U} \subseteq X \setminus V$. Because $F \subseteq V$, it follows that $\overline{U}$ and $F$ must be disjoint.
*   ($\Leftarrow$) Assume the closure condition holds. For a point $x$ and a disjoint [closed set](@entry_id:136446) $F$, we are guaranteed an open neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $\overline{U} \cap F = \emptyset$. We can now define a new open set $V = X \setminus \overline{U}$. Since $\overline{U}$ is closed, $V$ is open. By our assumption, $F$ is a subset of $V$. Furthermore, $U$ and $V$ are disjoint because $U \subseteq \overline{U}$. We have thus found two [disjoint open sets](@entry_id:150704), $U$ and $V$, separating $x$ and $F$, which is the definition of regularity.

This characterization gives rise to an even more useful one, sometimes called the "squeezing" property of [regular spaces](@entry_id:154729). In a T1 space $X$, regularity is equivalent to the following condition: for every point $x \in X$ and every neighborhood $W$ of $x$, there exists an [open neighborhood](@entry_id:268496) $V$ of $x$ such that $x \in V \subseteq \overline{V} \subseteq W$.

This property is immensely practical. It guarantees that between any point and any of its neighborhoods, we can always "squeeze" another neighborhood whose closure remains entirely inside the original one. We can derive this from the previous characterization. Given $x$ and a neighborhood $W$, we can first find an open set $G$ such that $x \in G \subseteq W$. The set $F = X \setminus G$ is closed and does not contain $x$. By the previous theorem, there is an [open neighborhood](@entry_id:268496) $V$ of $x$ such that $\overline{V} \cap F = \emptyset$. This is equivalent to saying $\overline{V} \subseteq X \setminus F = G$. Combining our inclusions, we have $x \in V \subseteq \overline{V} \subseteq G \subseteq W$, which establishes the result.

Let's visualize this. In the space $\mathbb{R}$ with its usual topology, consider the point $x=0$ and its neighborhood $W = (-3, 5)$. The space $\mathbb{R}$ is regular, so we should be able to find an open interval $V$ containing $0$ such that its closure, $\overline{V}$, is strictly contained in $W$. For instance, if we choose $V = (-2.9, 2.9)$, its closure is $\overline{V} = [-2.9, 2.9]$, which is indeed a subset of $(-3, 5)$. However, a choice like $V = (-3, 3)$ would fail, because its closure $\overline{V} = [-3, 3]$ is not a subset of $(-3, 5)$ as it includes the point $-3$ [@problem_id:1536049].

This principle extends to higher dimensions. In $\mathbb{R}^2$, let the point be the origin $(0,0)$ and the neighborhood be the open unit disk $W = \{(x,y) \mid x^2 + y^2  1\}$. If we want to find a neighborhood of the form of an open square, $U_s = (-s, s) \times (-s, s)$, whose closure fits inside $W$, we must ensure that every point in the closed square $\overline{U_s} = [-s, s] \times [-s, s]$ satisfies $x^2 + y^2  1$. The points in the closed square furthest from the origin are its four corners $(\pm s, \pm s)$, where $x^2+y^2 = 2s^2$. For the closure to be strictly inside the disk, we need $2s^2  1$, which means $s  1/\sqrt{2}$. The largest such square we can "squeeze" in has a side length approaching $\sqrt{2}$ [@problem_id:1536042].

### Regularity in the Separation Axiom Hierarchy

Regularity does not exist in a vacuum; it is part of a hierarchy of separation properties. Its relationship with the Hausdorff (T2) property is particularly important. In fact, every T3 space (T1 + Regular) is necessarily a T2 space.

The proof is a direct application of the definitions. To show a space is Hausdorff, we must separate any two distinct points, say $x$ and $y$, with [disjoint open sets](@entry_id:150704). In a T3 space, the T1 property guarantees that the singleton set $\{y\}$ is closed. Since $x \neq y$, we have a point $x$ and a closed set $\{y\}$ that does not contain $x$. The regularity property then guarantees the existence of [disjoint open sets](@entry_id:150704) $U$ and $V$ such that $x \in U$ and $\{y\} \subseteq V$. This is precisely the Hausdorff condition [@problem_id:1536048].

An even stronger separation property is **complete regularity**. A T1 space $X$ is completely regular (or a **Tychonoff space**, or a **T3.5 space**) if for any [closed set](@entry_id:136446) $C$ and any point $p \notin C$, there exists a continuous function $f: X \to [0, 1]$ such that $f(p) = 0$ and $f(x) = 1$ for all $x \in C$. This property implies regularity.

To see this, we can use the continuous function $f$ to construct the necessary separating sets. Given $p$ and $C$, we have $f(p)=0$ and $f(C) = \{1\}$. Consider the subsets $U' = [0, 1/2)$ and $V' = (1/2, 1]$ of the interval $[0,1]$. These sets are disjoint and are open in the subspace topology of $[0,1]$. Furthermore, $0 \in U'$ and $1 \in V'$. Because $f$ is continuous, their preimages, $U = f^{-1}(U')$ and $V = f^{-1}(V')$, are open and [disjoint sets](@entry_id:154341) in $X$. By construction, $p \in U$ and $C \subseteq V$. Thus, any [completely regular space](@entry_id:151585) is also regular [@problem_id:1536051]. This establishes the strict hierarchy $T3.5 \Rightarrow T3 \Rightarrow T2 \Rightarrow T1$.

### Properties and Pathologies of Regular Spaces

Understanding a topological property involves knowing when it is preserved under common constructions and, just as importantly, when it is not.

Regularity behaves well with respect to subspaces and finite products.
*   **Subspaces:** Any subspace of a [regular space](@entry_id:155336) is regular. This is a **hereditary** property. To see this intuitively, if we can separate a point from a [closed set](@entry_id:136446) in the larger space, the intersections of those separating sets with the subspace will typically serve to separate the corresponding point and set within the subspace. For example, consider the space of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}$. To separate the point $p=3$ from the [closed set](@entry_id:136446) $F=\{q \in \mathbb{Q} \mid q^2 \ge 10\}$, we can use the irrational number $\sqrt{10}$ as a boundary. The sets $U = \{q \in \mathbb{Q} \mid |q-3|  0.1\}$ and $V = \{q \in \mathbb{Q} \mid |q| > \sqrt{10}\}$ are open in $\mathbb{Q}$, disjoint, and separate $p$ from $F$ [@problem_id:1536005].
*   **Products:** The product of any finite number of [regular spaces](@entry_id:154729) is regular. (This property extends to [infinite products](@entry_id:176333) as well, a key result in [general topology](@entry_id:152375)). The neighborhood-closure characterizations are particularly useful for proving this.

Despite these stable behaviors, regularity fails to be preserved in some fundamental situations, and the counterexamples are highly instructive.

A classic example is the **[line with two origins](@entry_id:162106)**. This space is constructed by taking two copies of the real line and identifying every non-zero point $x$ on the first line with the corresponding point $x$ on the second, leaving two distinct origins. More formally, its points are $(\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}) \cup \{p, q\}$, and a basis for its topology includes standard [open intervals](@entry_id:157577) in $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$, along with sets of the form $(-\epsilon, \epsilon) \setminus \{0\} \cup \{p\}$ and $(-\delta, \delta) \setminus \{0\} \cup \{q\}$ for $\epsilon, \delta > 0$. This space is T1, but it is not regular. The point $p$ cannot be separated from the [closed set](@entry_id:136446) $\{q\}$. Any neighborhood of $p$ must contain a set $(-\epsilon, \epsilon) \setminus \{0\} \cup \{p\}$, and any neighborhood of $q$ must contain $(-\delta, \delta) \setminus \{0\} \cup \{q\}$. These two neighborhoods will always intersect in $(-\min(\epsilon,\delta), \min(\epsilon,\delta)) \setminus \{0\}$, so they can never be disjoint [@problem_id:1536006].

This same space illustrates another crucial fact: **regularity is not preserved by [continuous maps](@entry_id:153855)**. The [line with two origins](@entry_id:162106) can be realized as the quotient space of $X = \mathbb{R} \times \{0,1\}$ (two disjoint copies of the real line) by identifying $(x,0)$ with $(x,1)$ for all $x \neq 0$. The space $X$ is a [metric space](@entry_id:145912) and therefore regular. The [quotient map](@entry_id:140877) from this [regular space](@entry_id:155336) to the non-regular [line with two origins](@entry_id:162106) is continuous by definition. This shows that the continuous image of a [regular space](@entry_id:155336) is not, in general, regular [@problem_id:1536026].

Another important non-[regular space](@entry_id:155336) is $\mathbb{R}$ endowed with the **K-topology**. This space is Hausdorff but fails to be regular because the point $0$ cannot be separated from the closed set $K = \{1/n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}^+\}$. To show this, let $U$ be any [open neighborhood](@entry_id:268496) of $0$, and let $V$ be any [open neighborhood](@entry_id:268496) of $K$. By the definition of the topology, $U$ must contain an interval $(-\epsilon, \epsilon)$ for some $\epsilon > 0$. Since the sequence $1/n$ converges to $0$, any open set $V$ containing $K$ must contain points arbitrarily close to $0$, and thus must intersect $(-\epsilon, \epsilon)$. Therefore, $U$ and $V$ can never be disjoint, proving the space is not regular.
