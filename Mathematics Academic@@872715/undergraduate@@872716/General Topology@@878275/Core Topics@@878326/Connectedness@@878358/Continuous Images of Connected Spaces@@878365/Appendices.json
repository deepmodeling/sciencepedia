Working through this will solidify the powerful and intuitive idea that continuous functions cannot \"tear\" a connected object into separate pieces.", "problem": "Let $X$ be the topological space known as the \"figure-eight space,\" which can be visualized as the union of two circles in the plane that are tangent at a single point. This space is given to be connected.

The statement is true because $X$ is not compact, which allows its image to be a discrete set of points.\n\nB. The statement is true. For instance, one can define a function that maps all points of one circle to the value 1, all points of the other circle to the value 2, and the single common point to the value 3.\n\nC. The statement is false because the continuous image of a connected space must be connected, and the set $S = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ is not a connected subset of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nD.

The statement is false because the set $X$ has uncountably many points, while the set $S$ is finite, and a continuous function cannot map a larger set onto a smaller one.", "solution": "The core of this problem lies in a fundamental theorem of general topology concerning continuous functions and connected spaces. The theorem states that the image of a connected space under a continuous map is always a connected space.\n\nLet's analyze the components of the problem in light of this theorem.\n\nFirst, the domain space is the figure-eight space, $X$. The problem explicitly states that $X$ is a connected space.\n\nSecond, the function $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is given to be continuous.\n\nThird, the codomain is the set of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$, with its standard topology. The proposed image of the function is the subset $S = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nAccording to the theorem, if such a continuous function $f$ exists where $f(X) = S$, then the set $S$ must be a connected subset of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow, we must determine if the set $S = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ is a connected subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ under the standard topology. A key property of the real line is that a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ is connected if and only if it is an interval. An interval is a set of real numbers such that for any two points $a$ and $b$ in the set, every point between $a$ and $b$ is also in the set.\n\nLet's test if $S$ is an interval. Let's pick two points in $S$, for example, $a=1$ and $b=2$. A point between them is, for instance, $c=1.5$. According to the definition of an interval, if $S$ were connected, $c=1.5$ would have to be in $S$. However, $1.5 \\notin S$. Therefore, $S = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ is not an interval and, consequently, is not a connected subset of $\\mathbb{R}$. In fact, any finite set of two or more distinct points in $\\mathbb{R}$ is disconnected.\n\nSince the domain $X$ is connected and the proposed image $S$ is disconnected, the theorem implies that there can be no continuous function $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(X) = S$. Thus, the initial statement is false.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\nA. This is incorrect. The property of compactness is relevant to other theorems (e.g., the image of a compact space is compact), but connectedness is the key property here. Whether $X$ is compact or not does not determine if its image can be discrete. The figure-eight space is, in fact, compact, but this information is irrelevant to the question of connectedness.\nB. This describes a function, but it is not continuous. Consider the junction point $p$. If $f(p)=3$, then any open neighborhood of $p$ contains points from both circles. Let's call them circle 1 ($C_1$) and circle 2 ($C_2$). For any arbitrarily small neighborhood $U$ of $p$, there exist points $x_1 \\in U \\cap C_1$ and $x_2 \\in U \\cap C_2$. The proposed function would map these points as $f(x_1)=1$ and $f(x_2)=2$. Therefore, the image of any neighborhood of the junction point $p$ would contain the values {1, 2, 3}. However, in the codomain $\\mathbb{R}$, any open neighborhood of $f(p)=3$, for example $(2.5, 3.5)$, does not contain 1 or 2. This violates the definition of continuity.\nC. This assertion is correct. It correctly identifies that $X$ is connected, that a continuous image of a connected space must be connected, and that the target set $S = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ is not connected in $\\mathbb{R}$. This directly leads to the conclusion that the statement is false.\nD. This is incorrect. There is no theorem stating that a continuous function from $X$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must be injective. A very simple counterexample is the constant function $f(x) = c$ for all $x \\in X$, which is continuous but very far from injective.\nE. This is incorrect. The difference in cardinality between the domain and the image does not preclude the existence of a continuous surjective map. For example, the constant function $f(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in X$ is continuous and maps the uncountable set $X$ to the finite set $\\{1\\}$.\n\nTherefore, the only correct assertion is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1545765"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how the theorem works with different spaces, we now turn to a problem that reveals the crucial role of topology itself.

A key property of the closed interval $[0,1]$ with its standard topology is that it is a connected topological space.\n\nStep 2: Apply the theorem on continuous images of connected spaces.\nA fundamental theorem of topology states that the image of a connected space under a continuous function is connected. Since the domain $X = [0,1]$ is connected and the function $f: X \\to Y$ is continuous, the image $f(X)$ must be a connected subspace of the codomain $Y$.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the codomain space and its connected subspaces.\nThe codomain is the set $Y = [0,1]$ equipped with the discrete topology. In the discrete topology, every subset of $Y$ is open. Let's determine which subspaces of $Y$ are connected.\n\nA topological space $S$ is disconnected if there exist two non-empty, disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $S = U \\cup V$. A space is connected if it is not disconnected.\n\nConsider an arbitrary subset $S \\subseteq Y$. We want to know when $S$ is connected (viewed as a subspace of $Y$).\n- If $S$ is the empty set, it is connected by convention.\n- If $S$ is a singleton set, i.e., $S = \\{y_0\\}$ for some $y_0 \\in Y$, it cannot be written as the union of two non-empty disjoint open sets. Thus, any singleton set is connected.\n- If $S$ contains more than one point, let $y_1$ and $y_2$ be two distinct points in $S$. Let $U = \\{y_1\\}$ and $V = S \\setminus \\{y_1\\}$. In the discrete topology on $Y$, any subset is open. Therefore, $\\{y_1\\}$ is an open set in $Y$. The set $S \\setminus \\{y_1\\}$ is also a subset of $Y$, so it is also open in $Y$. When we consider the subspace topology on $S$, the open sets are intersections of open sets from $Y$ with $S$. So, $U = \\{y_1\\} = \\{y_1\\} \\cap S$ is open in $S$. Similarly, $V = (S \\setminus \\{y_1\\}) = (Y \\setminus \\{y_1\\}) \\cap S$ is open in $S$ (since $Y \\setminus \\{y_1\\}$ is open in $Y$). The sets $U$ and $V$ are non-empty (since $S$ has at least two points), they are disjoint, and their union is $S$. This shows that $S$ is disconnected.\n\nFrom this analysis, we conclude that the only connected subspaces of a space with the discrete topology are the empty set and singleton sets.\n\nStep 4: Combine the results.\nFrom Step 2, we know that the image $f(X)$ must be a connected subspace of $Y$. From Step 3, we know that the only connected subspaces of $Y$ are the empty set and singleton sets.\nThe domain $X = [0,1]$ is not empty, so its image $f(X)$ under any function $f$ cannot be the empty set.\nTherefore, the image $f(X)$ must be a singleton set. This means that $f(X) = \\{c\\}$ for some constant $c \\in Y = [0,1]$. In other words, the function $f$ must be a constant function.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. The image $f(X)$ can be any finite subset of $Y$. This is false. A finite set with more than one element is disconnected in the discrete topology.\n- B. The image $f(X)$ must be a singleton set (a set containing exactly one point). This is true, as derived above.\n- C. The image $f(X)$ can be any closed interval $[a, b]$ where $0 \\le a \\le b \\le 1$. This is false. Any such interval with $a  b$ contains more than one point and would be disconnected in the discrete topology. This would be true if $Y$ had the standard topology (by the Intermediate Value Theorem).\n- D. The image $f(X)$ must be the entire set $Y$. This is false. The set $Y=[0,1]$ has infinitely many points and is therefore disconnected in the discrete topology.\n- E. The image $f(X)$ can be any countable subset of $Y$. This is false. Any countable set with more than one element is disconnected in the discrete topology.\n\nThus, the only correct statement is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1545792"}, {"introduction": "Let's now generalize the principle from a single connected space to one composed of multiple connected components.

Therefore,\n$$\nf(X)=\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} f(C_{i})\n$$\nis a union of $n$ connected subsets.

Consequently, the number of connected components of $f(X)$ is at most $n$.\n\nTo see this bound is sharp, construct $f$ so that the images of distinct components are disjoint and do not merge. For example, let $Y$ be any space with at least $n$ points (such as $\\mathbb{R}$) and define $f$ to be constant on each $C_{i}$ with distinct constant values for different $i$.
