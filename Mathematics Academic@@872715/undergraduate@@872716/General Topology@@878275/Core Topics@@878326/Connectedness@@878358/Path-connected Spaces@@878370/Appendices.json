If $q\\neq -p$, define\n$$\n\\gamma(t)=\\frac{(1-t)p+tq}{\\|(1-t)p+tq\\|}.\n$$\nThe denominator is never zero for $t\\in[0,1]$ because $(1-t)p+tq=0$ would imply $q=-\\frac{1-t}{t}p$ with $t\\in(0,1)$, which contradicts $q\\neq -p$. Thus $\\gamma$ is continuous and lies in $S^{2}$ with $\\gamma(0)=p$ and $\\gamma(1)=q$. If $q=-p$, choose any $r\\in S^{2}$ with $r\\neq \\pm p$ (such a choice exists because $S^{2}$ has more than two points), and connect $p$ to $r$ and then $r$ to $q$ using the same normalized linear interpolation; concatenating these two paths yields a path from $p$ to $q$.

The factor $SO(2)$ is path-connected: if $Q$ is a rotation by angle $\\theta$, the path $Q_{t}$ given by rotation by angle $t\\theta$ connects $I$ to $Q$. The factor $\\mathrm{SPD}(2)$ is path-connected: for any $S\\in \\mathrm{SPD}(2)$, the matrix logarithm $\\ln(S)$ exists (since $S$ has a spectral decomposition with positive eigenvalues), and the path\n$$\nS_{t}=\\exp(t\\,\\ln(S)),\\quad t\\in[0,1],\n$$\nlies in $\\mathrm{SPD}(2)$, with $S_{0}=I$ and $S_{1}=S$.

For any $z\\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$, the open Euclidean ball $B(z,\\frac{1}{2})$ satisfies $B(z,\\frac{1}{2})\\cap \\mathbb{Z}^{n}=\\{z\\}$, so $\\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ is discrete. Any connected subset of a discrete space is a singleton. If $\\gamma:[0,1]\\to \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ is continuous, then $\\gamma([0,1])$ is connected as the continuous image of a connected set, hence $\\gamma([0,1])$ is a singleton.
