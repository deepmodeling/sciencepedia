We set $Y=\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}G_{n}$ and test each condition for being sufficient to guarantee that $Y$ is connected.\n\nFirst, we recall a standard topological fact: if $A$ and $B$ are connected subsets of a topological space with $A\\cap B\\neq\\emptyset$, then $A\\cup B$ is connected. Also, if $\\{C_{k}\\}_{k\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ is an increasing sequence of connected sets, i.e., $C_{k}\\subseteq C_{k+1}$ for all $k$, then $\\bigcup_{k=1}^{\\infty}C_{k}$ is connected.

We prove by induction that $U_{N}$ is connected for all $N$.\n- Base case: $U_{1}=G_{1}$ is connected.\n- Inductive step: Assume $U_{N}$ is connected. Because $G_{N}\\subseteq U_{N}$ and $G_{N}\\cap G_{N+1}\\neq\\emptyset$, we have $U_{N}\\cap G_{N+1}\\supseteq G_{N}\\cap G_{N+1}\\neq\\emptyset$. By the union-of-connected-sets-with-nonempty-intersection principle, $U_{N+1}=U_{N}\\cup G_{N+1}$ is connected.\nThus each $U_{N}$ is connected. Since $(U_{N})_{N}$ is an increasing sequence of connected sets, $Y=\\bigcup_{N=1}^{\\infty}U_{N}$ is connected. Therefore condition A is sufficient.\n\nB.

This merely guarantees that for at least one index $n_{0}$, $G_{n_{0}}\\cap G_{n_{0}+1}\\neq\\emptyset$, but all other pairs may be disjoint. Construct a counterexample: let $f_{1}(x)=0$ and $f_{2}(x)=0$ (so $G_{1}=G_{2}$ and $G_{1}\\cap G_{2}=G_{1}\\neq\\emptyset$), and for $n\\geq 3$ set $f_{n}(x)=n$.

Then $\\sup_{x\\in[0,1]}|f_{n}(x)-0|=1/n\\to 0$, so $f_{n}\\to f\\equiv 0$ uniformly. The graphs $G_{n}$ are the horizontal segments $[0,1]\\times\\{(-1)^{n}/n\\}$. Distinct $G_{n}$ are disjoint. Set $Y_{+}=Y\\cap\\{(x,y):y0\\}$ and $Y_{-}=Y\\cap\\{(x,y):y0\\}$. Both $Y_{+}$ and $Y_{-}$ are nonempty, disjoint, and open in $Y$ (as intersections with open subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$), hence $Y=Y_{+}\\cup Y_{-}$ is disconnected. Therefore C is not sufficient.\n\nD. Suppose for each $x\\in[0,1]$ the sequence $(f_{n}(x))_{n}$ is monotonic. Take $f_{n}(x)=n$ for all $x\\in[0,1]$. Then for each fixed $x$, $(f_{n}(x))=(n)$ is monotone increasing, and each $G_{n}=[0,1]\\times\\{n\\}$. Distinct $G_{n}$ are disjoint and separated by a positive vertical distance. For any point $(x,n)\\in G_{n}$, a Euclidean ball of radius less than $\\frac{1}{2}$ intersects $Y$ only in $G_{n}$, so each $G_{n}$ is open in the subspace $Y$; since each $G_{n}$ is also closed in $Y$ (it is compact in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$), $Y$ is a disjoint union of nonempty clopen sets and hence is disconnected.
