Such a function $\\gamma$ is called a path or an arc.\n\nLet the path be represented by its coordinate functions, $\\gamma(t) = (\\gamma_x(t), \\gamma_y(t))$, where $\\gamma_x$ and $\\gamma_y$ are continuous real-valued functions on the interval $[0, 1]$. For the path to lie entirely within $S$, it is required that for all $t \\in [0, 1]$, both $\\gamma_x(t)$ and $\\gamma_y(t)$ are irrational numbers.

A path consisting of perpendicular segments involves segments parallel to the coordinate axes. For example, connecting $(x_1, y_1)$ to $(x_1, y_2)$. The first coordinate is fixed as an irrational number $x_1$. The second coordinate varies continuously from $y_1$ to $y_2$. By the same Intermediate Value Theorem argument, this coordinate must pass through rational values, so the path leaves $S$.\nOption C is false because, as shown by our main argument, no path of any kind can connect two points with different x-coordinates (or different y-coordinates).\n\nTherefore, the set $S$ is not arcwise connected.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1531803"}]}
