## Introduction
The torus, with its familiar donut shape, is one of the most fundamental and illustrative objects in topology. While intuitively understood as a surface with a hole, its formal construction provides a gateway to powerful mathematical concepts. The process of "gluing" the edges of a flat sheet of paper to form this shape hints at a deeper topological procedure. This article formalizes that intuition by introducing the torus as a **quotient space**, a method for building new [topological spaces](@entry_id:155056) by identifying points in an existing one. It addresses the gap between the intuitive idea of gluing and the rigorous mathematical framework required to analyze the resulting object's properties.

This article will guide you through this essential construction across three chapters. In **Principles and Mechanisms**, we will define the precise [equivalence relation](@entry_id:144135) on a square that creates the torus, explore the [quotient topology](@entry_id:150384), and prove that the result is a manifold homeomorphic to the product of two circles, $S^1 \times S^1$. Next, in **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, we will see how this quotient model is a critical tool for understanding paths, metrics, and periodic functions on the torus, with significant implications for fields ranging from dynamical systems to [differential geometry](@entry_id:145818). Finally, **Hands-On Practices** will offer exercises to apply and solidify your understanding of these abstract concepts.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In the preceding chapter, we introduced the intuitive idea of constructing topological spaces by "gluing" pieces of existing spaces together. This chapter formalizes this process through the concept of a [quotient space](@entry_id:148218), using the [construction of the torus](@entry_id:265065) as our primary case study. We will dissect the principles of this construction, explore its topological consequences, and establish its equivalence to other common definitions of the torus.

### The Quotient Space Construction of the Torus

The construction of a torus begins with a simple, familiar object: the closed unit square in the Euclidean plane, $I^2 = [0, 1] \times [0, 1]$. The torus is formed by identifying, or "gluing," the opposite edges of this square. This gluing process is mathematically defined by an **[equivalence relation](@entry_id:144135)**, denoted by the symbol $\sim$.

The [equivalence relation](@entry_id:144135) for constructing a torus is generated by two fundamental rules:
1.  **Vertical Identification**: For any horizontal position $x \in [0, 1]$, the point $(x, 0)$ on the bottom edge is identified with the point $(x, 1)$ on the top edge. We write this as $(x, 0) \sim (x, 1)$.
2.  **Horizontal Identification**: For any vertical position $y \in [0, 1]$, the point $(0, y)$ on the left edge is identified with the point $(1, y)$ on the right edge. We write this as $(0, y) \sim (1, y)$.

The full equivalence relation is the smallest relation that contains these rules and also satisfies the properties of being reflexive ($p \sim p$), symmetric (if $p \sim q$, then $q \sim p$), and transitive (if $p \sim q$ and $q \sim r$, then $p \sim r$). Each point in the square belongs to an **equivalence class**, which is the set of all points in the square that are equivalent to it.

Let's examine the structure of these [equivalence classes](@entry_id:156032):
-   **Interior Points**: For any point $p = (x, y)$ in the interior of the square (where $0 \lt x \lt 1$ and $0 \lt y \lt 1$), it is not on any boundary. Thus, it is only equivalent to itself. Its equivalence class is simply the singleton set $\{p\}$.

-   **Edge Points (Non-Corners)**: Consider a point on an edge, such as $p = (1/2, 0)$ [@problem_id:1543664]. According to the vertical identification rule, $(1/2, 0) \sim (1/2, 1)$. Since neither of these points lies on the vertical edges ($x=0$ or $x=1$), the horizontal identification rule does not apply. No other points can be reached through transitivity. Therefore, the [equivalence class](@entry_id:140585) is the two-point set $\{(1/2, 0), (1/2, 1)\}$. A similar logic applies to points on the interior of the vertical edges.

-   **Corner Points**: The situation for the four corner points—$(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(1,1)$—is more interesting, as both identification rules can be applied sequentially [@problem_id:1543696]. Starting with $(0,0)$:
    -   By horizontal identification (with $y=0$), we have $(0,0) \sim (1,0)$.
    -   By vertical identification (with $x=0$), we have $(0,0) \sim (0,1)$.
    -   By [transitivity](@entry_id:141148), we now know that $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(0,1)$ are all in the same class.
    -   Furthermore, from $(1,0)$, applying vertical identification (with $x=1$) gives $(1,0) \sim (1,1)$.
    -   Using [transitivity](@entry_id:141148) again, for example via the chain $(0,1) \sim (0,0) \sim (1,0) \sim (1,1)$, we find that all four corner points are mutually equivalent. Thus, they form a single equivalence class: $\{(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1)\}$.

The torus, denoted $T^2$, is formally defined as the set of all these equivalence classes. This new space is called the **[quotient space](@entry_id:148218)** of the square under the relation $\sim$, written as $T^2 = I^2 / \sim$. There is a natural surjective map, the **[quotient map](@entry_id:140877)** $\pi: I^2 \to T^2$, that sends each point $p \in I^2$ to its equivalence class, $[p] \in T^2$.

### The Quotient Topology and Local Structure

The geometric intuition of "gluing" is captured topologically by endowing the set of [equivalence classes](@entry_id:156032) $T^2$ with the **[quotient topology](@entry_id:150384)**. In this topology, a set $U \subseteq T^2$ is defined to be open if and only if its preimage under the [quotient map](@entry_id:140877), $\pi^{-1}(U) = \{ p \in I^2 \mid \pi(p) \in U \}$, is an open set in the original space $I^2$. This definition ensures that the [quotient map](@entry_id:140877) $\pi$ is continuous.

This definition has profound implications for the local geometry of the torus. Every point on the torus has a neighborhood that looks like an open disk in $\mathbb{R}^2$, which is the defining property of a [2-dimensional manifold](@entry_id:267450). Let's see why this is true by examining the preimages of neighborhoods of different types of points.

-   **Neighborhood of an Interior Point**: If we take a point $P = \pi(x,y)$ where $(x,y)$ is in the interior of $I^2$, a small open disk around $(x,y)$ in the square is the [preimage](@entry_id:150899) of an open neighborhood of $P$. Thus, $P$ already has a Euclidean-looking neighborhood.

-   **Neighborhood of an Edge Point**: Consider a point on a glued edge, such as $P = \pi(1/2, 1)$ [@problem_id:1543659]. Since $\pi(1/2, 1) = \pi(1/2, 0)$, any [open neighborhood](@entry_id:268496) $N$ of $P$ must have a preimage $\pi^{-1}(N)$ that contains both $(1/2, 1)$ and $(1/2, 0)$. By the definition of the [quotient topology](@entry_id:150384), $\pi^{-1}(N)$ must be an open set in $I^2$. This means $\pi^{-1}(N)$ must contain small open half-disks around both points within the square. For a sufficiently small neighborhood $N$, its [preimage](@entry_id:150899) consists of two disjoint regions: an open half-disk just below the top edge at $x=1/2$ and another open half-disk just above the bottom edge at $x=1/2$. In the quotient space $T^2$, these two half-disks are glued along their diameters to form a single, complete open disk around the point $P$.

-   **Neighborhood of the Corner Point**: The most complex case is the single point $q_0 = \pi(0,0)$ that corresponds to all four corners [@problem_id:1543711]. Let $U$ be a small open neighborhood of $q_0$ on the torus. Its preimage, $\pi^{-1}(U)$, must be an open set in $I^2$ containing all four corner points: $(0,0), (1,0), (0,1),$ and $(1,1)$. For a sufficiently small $U$, its [preimage](@entry_id:150899) will consist of four disjoint regions: a quarter-disk at each corner of the square. For example, the part of $\pi^{-1}(U)$ near $(0,0)$ is the intersection of a small open disk centered at $(0,0)$ with the square $I^2$. When we form the [quotient space](@entry_id:148218), these four quarter-disks are glued together: the quarter-disk at $(0,0)$ glues to the one at $(1,0)$ along their vertical edges (since $(0,y) \sim (1,y)$) and to the one at $(0,1)$ along their horizontal edges (since $(x,0) \sim (x,1)$). The full set of identifications ultimately pieces these four quarter-disks together to form one seamless open disk around $q_0$ [@problem_id:1543687].

In every case, we find that any point on the torus possesses a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open disk. This confirms that the torus is a **[2-manifold](@entry_id:152719)**, a space that is locally indistinguishable from the Euclidean plane.

### Equivalence to the Product Space $S^1 \times S^1$

An alternative and equally fundamental definition describes the torus as the Cartesian product of two circles, $T_p = S^1 \times S^1$. Here, $S^1$ is the unit circle in the complex plane, $S^1 = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} \mid |z| = 1 \}$. A point on this product-space torus can be written as an [ordered pair](@entry_id:148349) of complex numbers $(z_1, z_2)$ where $|z_1| = 1$ and $|z_2| = 1$. We can demonstrate that our quotient construction $I^2/\sim$ is topologically identical (homeomorphic) to this product space.

The connection is made explicit through the [continuous map](@entry_id:153772) $f: I^2 \to S^1 \times S^1$ defined by:
$$ f(x, y) = (\exp(2\pi i x), \exp(2\pi i y)) $$
This map wraps the unit square onto the torus: the coordinate $x$ determines the angle on the first circle, and the coordinate $y$ determines the angle on the second. Crucially, this map respects the equivalence relation $\sim$. For instance, for a point $(x,0)$ on the bottom edge and $(x,1)$ on the top edge:
$$ f(x, 0) = (\exp(2\pi i x), \exp(0)) = (\exp(2\pi i x), 1) $$
$$ f(x, 1) = (\exp(2\pi i x), \exp(2\pi i \cdot 1)) = (\exp(2\pi i x), 1) $$
Since $f(x,0) = f(x,1)$, the map sends these equivalent points to the same point on $S^1 \times S^1$. A similar calculation shows $f(0,y) = f(1,y)$. The map $f$ is constant on the [equivalence classes](@entry_id:156032) of $\sim$.

According to the universal property of [quotient spaces](@entry_id:274314), because $f$ is continuous and respects the equivalence classes, it induces a unique, continuous, and bijective map $h: I^2/\sim \to S^1 \times S^1$ such that $f = h \circ \pi$. Since $I^2/\sim$ is compact and $S^1 \times S^1$ is Hausdorff (as we will see), this [induced map](@entry_id:271712) $h$ is a **homeomorphism**. This rigorously proves that the space obtained by [gluing a square](@entry_id:150967) is indeed the same as the product of two circles.

This [homeomorphism](@entry_id:146933) allows us to visualize how features on the square transform into features on the torus [@problem_id:1543706]. Consider the vertical line segment $L = \{ (1/4, y) \mid y \in [0, 1] \}$ in the square. Its image under the map $f$ is:
$$ f(L) = \{ (\exp(2\pi i / 4), \exp(2\pi i y)) \mid y \in [0, 1] \} = \{ (i, z) \mid z \in S^1 \} $$
This is a circle on the product space $S^1 \times S^1$ where the first coordinate is fixed at $i$ and the second coordinate traverses the entire circle $S^1$. This corresponds to a "longitudinal" circle on the torus. Similarly, a horizontal line segment in the square would map to a "latitudinal" circle.

This construction can also be seen as a two-step process [@problem_id:1543705]. First, identifying the edges $(x,0)$ and $(x,1)$ of the square $I^2$ creates a cylinder, which is homeomorphic to $S^1 \times [0,1]$. The remaining unidentified edges, $(0,y)$ and $(1,y)$, become the circular boundaries of this cylinder. The second identification, $(0,y) \sim (1,y)$, then glues these two boundary circles together, forming the torus.

### Fundamental Topological Properties

The quotient construction provides a powerful tool for deducing the global properties of the torus.

#### Compactness

The torus is a **compact** space. This follows directly from a fundamental theorem of topology: the [continuous image of a compact space](@entry_id:265606) is compact. The unit square $I^2$ is a closed and bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. By the Heine-Borel Theorem, this means $I^2$ is compact. The [quotient map](@entry_id:140877) $\pi: I^2 \to T^2$ is, by definition, continuous and surjective. Therefore, its image, the torus $T^2 = \pi(I^2)$, must be compact [@problem_id:1543662].

#### The Hausdorff Property

A [topological space](@entry_id:149165) is **Hausdorff** if for any two distinct points, there exist disjoint open neighborhoods containing them. The torus is Hausdorff, a property inherited from the fact that its [equivalence relation](@entry_id:144135) is "well-behaved". To appreciate why, it is instructive to see what happens when the gluing is incomplete [@problem_id:1543680].

Imagine a modified [equivalence relation](@entry_id:144135) where we only identify the *interiors* of the opposite edges: $(x,0) \sim (x,1)$ for $0 \lt x \lt 1$ and $(0,y) \sim (1,y)$ for $0 \lt y \lt 1$. In this construction, the four corner points are no longer equivalent to each other; they become four distinct points in the quotient space. Let's consider two of these points, $p_A = [(0,0)]$ and $p_B = [(1,0)]$. Can we separate them with disjoint open sets?

Let $U$ be any [open neighborhood](@entry_id:268496) of $p_A$. Its preimage $\pi^{-1}(U)$ must be an open set in $I^2$ containing $(0,0)$. This means $\pi^{-1}(U)$ must contain a small segment of the left edge, say $\{ (0,y) \mid 0 \le y  \epsilon \}$ for some $\epsilon > 0$. Because the relation identifies $(0,y)$ with $(1,y)$ for $y \in (0, \epsilon)$, the preimage $\pi^{-1}(U)$ must also contain the segment $\{ (1,y) \mid 0  y  \epsilon \}$ to be a [saturated set](@entry_id:155857). Now, consider any [open neighborhood](@entry_id:268496) $V$ of $p_B$. Its [preimage](@entry_id:150899) $\pi^{-1}(V)$ must be an open set containing $(1,0)$, so it too must contain points of the form $(1,y)$ for small positive $y$. Consequently, any neighborhood of $p_A$ and any neighborhood of $p_B$ must have preimages that overlap near the right edge of the square. This implies that the neighborhoods $U$ and $V$ themselves must intersect. Since $p_A$ and $p_B$ cannot be separated, this modified space is not Hausdorff. This highlights the crucial role of identifying the corners to create a manifold.

#### Orientability and Variations

The specific way edges are identified determines the resulting surface. Our [construction of the torus](@entry_id:265065) involves orientation-preserving identifications. If we traverse the boundary of the square counter-clockwise, the edge word is `aba^{-1}b^{-1}`, where the inverse indicates a traversal in the opposite direction. This leads to an [orientable surface](@entry_id:274245).

If we introduce a "twist" in one of the identifications, we can create a different manifold. For example, if we keep $(x,0) \sim (x,1)$ but change the horizontal gluing to $(0,y) \sim (1, 1-y)$, we are identifying the left edge with the right edge in opposite directions [@problem_id:1543678]. This corresponds to an edge word `aba^{-1}b`. This construction yields a non-orientable surface known as the **Klein bottle**. This simple variation demonstrates that the rules of quotienting are a precise and powerful language for constructing and distinguishing between different [topological spaces](@entry_id:155056).
