Thus this is not the most fundamental reason for not being open.\n- C: A set need not be a single basis element to be open; open sets are unions of basis elements. Hence this does not imply non-openness.\n- D: If $S$ were open, then its projection onto the y-axis would be open because projections are open maps in the product topology; since the projection is $\\{0\\}$, not open in $\\mathbb{R}$, this also shows $S$ is not open.
