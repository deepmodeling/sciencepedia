So we need to find when $(0,c) \\sim (1,c)$.\n\nLet's examine the identification rules.\nRule 1, $(x,0) \\sim (x,1)$, does not apply because we are given that $c \\in (0,1)$, so $c \\ne 0$ and $c \\ne 1$.\nRule 2, $(0,y) \\sim (1, 1-y)$, applies to the starting point $(0,c)$. Setting $y=c$ in this rule, we find the identification for our starting point:\n$$ (0,c) \\sim (1, 1-c) $$\nThis means the point on the left edge at height $c$ is identified with the point on the right edge at height $1-c$.\n\nWe require the start and end points of our path to be identified, i.e., $(0,c) \\sim (1,c)$.\nFrom the identification rule, we know that $(0,c) \\sim (1, 1-c)$.\nBy transitivity of the equivalence relation, if $(0,c) \\sim (1,c)$ and $(0,c) \\sim (1, 1-c)$, then it must be that $(1,c) \\sim (1, 1-c)$.\n\nThe equivalence relation $\\sim$ only identifies points on the boundary of the square $S$. Two distinct points in the interior of the same edge, such as $(1,y_1)$ and $(1,y_2)$ with $y_1 \\ne y_2$, are not identified. Therefore, the condition $(1,c) \\sim (1, 1-c)$ can only be satisfied if the two points are identical.\nThis implies their y-coordinates must be equal:\n$$ c = 1-c $$\nSolving this equation for $c$:\n$$ 2c = 1 $$\n$$ c = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThus, the horizontal line segment forms a closed loop only when it is at height $c = 1/2$.\n\nFor the loop to be simple, no other points on the segment may be identified. An interior point of the segment is of the form $(x,c)$ with $0  x  1$. Such a point is in the interior of the square $S$, where no identifications occur. Therefore, it is not identified with any other point on the segment. This confirms that for $c=1/2$, the resulting closed loop is simple.

A more general and powerful method in topology involves specifying a \"boundary word\" for any polygon, which provides a complete recipe for how its edges are to be identified. This problem challenges you to apply the formal tools of surface classification, including the Euler characteristic $\\chi$, to identify which hexagonal construction yields a Klein bottle, thereby connecting this specific surface to the broader theory of topological manifolds. [@problem_id:1543038]", "problem": "In topology, a compact surface can be constructed by gluing the edges of a polygon. This process is encoded by a \"boundary word,\" which lists the labels of the polygon's edges in a sequence as one traverses the boundary. If an edge label $x$ appears, it means the edge is oriented in the direction of traversal. If $x^{-1}$ appears, it is oriented against the direction of traversal. All edges with the same letter (regardless of the exponent) are identified (glued together) in a way that respects their orientation.\n\nThe resulting surface's properties are determined by this boundary word. A key invariant is the Euler characteristic, $\\chi$, given by $\\chi = V - E + F$, where $V$ is the number of distinct vertex classes after identification, $E$ is the number of distinct edge classes, and $F$ is the number of faces (which is 1 for a single polygon).\n\nThe Klein bottle is a well-known non-orientable surface with an Euler characteristic of $\\chi=0$.\n\nConsider a regular hexagon, which has 6 sides.

Since the six edges are identified in pairs, there are three distinct classes of edges, so $E=3$. The Euler characteristic formula becomes $\\chi = V - E + F = V - 3 + 1 = V - 2$.\nFor the resulting surface to be a Klein bottle, we need $\\chi=0$. Therefore, we must have $V-2=0$, which implies that the number of distinct vertex classes after identification, $V$, must be 2.\n\nAdditionally, the surface must be non-orientable. A surface constructed from a polygon is non-orientable if its boundary word contains at least one pair of edges identified with the same orientation (e.g., a sequence like $...x...x...$). If all edge pairs are identified with opposite orientations (e.g., $...x...x^{-1}...$ for all pairs), the surface is orientable.\n\nWe will now analyze each option. Let the vertices of the hexagon be $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5, v_6$ in counter-clockwise order.
