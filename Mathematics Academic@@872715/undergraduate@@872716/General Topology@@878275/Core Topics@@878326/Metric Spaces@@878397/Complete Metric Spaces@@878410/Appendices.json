This exercise challenges that intuition directly, forcing us to confront the more stringent requirement that all terms beyond a certain point must be arbitrarily close to each other.

Proof sketch: if $Y$ is closed and $(y_{n})$ is Cauchy in $Y$, then it is Cauchy in $X$ and converges in $X$ to some $y$. Since $Y$ is closed, $y \\in Y$, so $Y$ is complete.
