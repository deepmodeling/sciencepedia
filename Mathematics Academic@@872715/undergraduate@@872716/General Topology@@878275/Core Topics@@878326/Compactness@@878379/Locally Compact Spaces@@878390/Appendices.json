By the Heine–Borel theorem, a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The set $L$ is bounded. It is not closed in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ because, for example, the sequence $(1-\\frac{1}{n},\\frac{1}{2})\\in L$ converges to $(1,\\frac{1}{2})\\notin L$. Therefore $L$ is not closed in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, hence not compact. Thus option A is false.\n\nSecond, connectedness. The set $[0,1)$ is an interval in $\\mathbb{R}$, and every interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ is connected. The product of connected spaces is connected, so $L=[0,1)\\times[0,1)$ is connected. Hence $L$ is connected.\n\nThird, local compactness. A space is locally compact if every point has a neighborhood whose closure is compact. Fix $p=(x,y)\\in L$.

Any neighborhood $U$ of $0_{1}$ in $L$ has a preimage $q^{-1}(U)$ that is an open set in $X$ containing $(0,1)$, hence it contains some interval $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)\\times\\{1\\}$ for $\\epsilon>0$. Similarly, any neighborhood $V$ of $0_{2}$ has a preimage containing some interval $(-\\delta, \\delta)\\times\\{2\\}$ for $\\delta>0$. For any $x \\in (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\cap (-\\delta, \\delta)$ with $x \\neq 0$, we have $q(x,1)=q(x,2)$. This point belongs to both $U$ and $V$, so $U \\cap V$ is non-empty. Thus $0_{1}$ and $0_{2}$ cannot be separated by disjoint open sets, and $L$ is not Hausdorff. Therefore (i) is false.\n\n(ii) For local compactness, fix a point $p \\in L$. If $p$ corresponds to a nonzero real number $x$, it has a compact neighborhood homeomorphic to a closed interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ that does not contain $0$. If $p=0_1$, any basic neighborhood is of the form $U_n = q((-\\frac{1}{n}, \\frac{1}{n}) \\times \\{1\\})$. The closure of this neighborhood is $\\overline{U_n} = q([-\\frac{1}{n}, \\frac{1}{n}] \\times \\{1\\}) \\cup \\{0_2\\}$. This set is the continuous image under $q$ of the compact set $[-\\frac{1}{n}, \\frac{1}{n}] \\times \\{1\\} \\cup \\{(0,2)\\}$, so it is compact. Thus, $0_1$ has a basis of neighborhoods with compact closures. A similar argument applies to $0_2$. Therefore, $L$ is locally compact. Thus (ii) is true.\n\n(iii) For connectedness, we show $L$ is path-connected. Any two points $p_1, p_2$ that do not correspond to an origin can be connected by a path that stays on one of the \"lines.\" To connect the two origins, $0_1$ and $0_2$, we can construct a path. Let $\\gamma_1: [0,1] \\to L$ be the path $\\gamma_1(t) = q(t, 1)$, which connects $0_1$ to the point $q(1,1)$. Let $\\gamma_2: [0,1] \\to L$ be the path $\\gamma_2(t) = q(1-t, 2)$, which connects $q(1,2)$ to $0_2$. Since $q(1,1)=q(1,2)$, we can concatenate these two paths to form a continuous path from $0_1$ to $0_2$. Since all points can be connected to an origin, and the origins can be connected to each other, the entire space is path-connected, and therefore connected. Thus (iii) is true.\n\n(iv) For first countability, any non-origin point has a countable neighborhood basis, as in $\\mathbb{R}$. At the origin $0_1$, the family of sets $\\mathcal{B}_{1} = \\{q((-\\frac{1}{n},\\frac{1}{n})\\times\\{1\\}) : n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$ forms a countable neighborhood basis. To see this, let $O$ be any open neighborhood of $0_1$. Its preimage $q^{-1}(O)$ is open in $X$ and contains $(0,1)$, so it must contain an interval $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\times \\{1\\}$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$. By choosing $n$ such that $1/n  \\epsilon$, we have $q((-\\frac{1}{n},\\frac{1}{n})\\times\\{1\\}) \\subseteq O$. A similar argument holds for $0_2$. Therefore, $L$ is first-countable.
