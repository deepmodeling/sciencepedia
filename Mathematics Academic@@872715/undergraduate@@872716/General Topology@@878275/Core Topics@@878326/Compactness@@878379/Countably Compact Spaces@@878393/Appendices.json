The Sorgenfrey line is countably compact, because every infinite subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ has a limit point in the Sorgenfrey line.", "solution": "To determine if the Sorgenfrey line is countably compact, we must check if it satisfies the definition: every countable open cover must have a finite subcover. If we can find even one countable open cover that does not have a finite subcover, then the space is not countably compact.\n\nLet's analyze the collection of sets proposed in option A: $\\mathcal{U} = \\{[n, n+1) \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. We need to verify three things about this collection $\\mathcal{U}$:\n1.  Is it a collection of open sets in the Sorgenfrey line?\n2.  Is it countable?\n3.  Does it cover $\\mathbb{R}$?\n\nFirst, each set in $\\mathcal{U}$ is of the form $[n, n+1)$, which fits the definition of a basis element $[a, b)$ in the lower-limit topology. Since basis elements are open sets, every set in $\\mathcal{U}$ is an open set.\n\nSecond, the collection $\\mathcal{U}$ is indexed by the set of integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$. The set of integers is a countable set. Therefore, $\\mathcal{U}$ is a countable collection of open sets.\n\nThird, we check if $\\mathcal{U}$ covers $\\mathbb{R}$. That is, is it true that $\\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} [n, n+1) = \\mathbb{R}$? For any arbitrary real number $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we can consider its floor, $n = \\lfloor x \\rfloor$. By the definition of the floor function, $n$ is an integer and it satisfies the inequality $n \\le x < n+1$. This means that $x$ is an element of the interval $[n, n+1)$. Since $n$ is an integer, the set $[n, n+1)$ is a member of the collection $\\mathcal{U}$. Thus, every real number $x$ is contained in some set in $\\mathcal{U}$, which means that $\\mathcal{U}$ is indeed a cover of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSo far, we have established that $\\mathcal{U}$ is a countable open cover of the Sorgenfrey line. Now, we must determine if it has a finite subcover. Let's take any finite subcollection of $\\mathcal{U}$, which we can denote as $\\mathcal{U}' = \\{[n_1, n_1+1), [n_2, n_2+1), \\dots, [n_k, n_k+1)\\}$, where $\\{n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_k\\}$ is a finite set of integers. Let $N_{max} = \\max\\{n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_k\\}$. The union of the sets in this finite subcollection is $\\bigcup_{i=1}^k [n_i, n_i+1)$. Any point $y$ in this union must be in at least one of the intervals, say $[n_j, n_j+1)$. This implies $y < n_j+1 \\le N_{max}+1$. Therefore, any real number greater than or equal to $N_{max}+1$, for example $N_{max}+2$, is not contained in this finite union. Since no finite subcollection can cover all of $\\mathbb{R}$, the countable open cover $\\mathcal{U}$ does not have a finite subcover.\n\nBecause we have found a countable open cover with no finite subcover, the Sorgenfrey line is not countably compact. This reasoning directly corresponds to option A.\n\nLet's briefly examine why the other options are incorrect.\n- Option B suggests a valid reason for the Sorgenfrey line not being *compact*, as the cover $\\mathcal{V}$ is an *uncountable* open cover with no finite subcover. However, failing the test for compactness with an uncountable cover provides no information about countable compactness, which is only concerned with countable covers.\n- Option C gives the definition of a Lindelöf space. The Sorgenfrey line is, in fact, Lindelöf, but being Lindelöf and being countably compact are different topological properties. This option incorrectly equates the two.\n- Option D makes a claim about limit points. The property that \"every infinite subset has a limit point\" is the definition of limit point compactness. For a $T_1$ space, limit point compactness is equivalent to countable compactness. The Sorgenfrey line is a $T_1$ space. However, the premise in option D is false. The set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is an infinite subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, but it has no limit point in the Sorgenfrey line. For any point $x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}$, the open neighborhood $[\\lfloor x \\rfloor, \\lfloor x \\rfloor + 1)$ contains $x$ but no integers. For any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the open neighborhood $[k, k+1)$ contains $k$ but no other integers. Thus, no point in $\\mathbb{R}$ is a limit point of $\\mathbb{Z}$. Since the premise is false, the conclusion is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the only correct statement and justification is given in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1547194"}, {"introduction": "Topologists not only study individual spaces but also how properties behave when we build new spaces from old ones. This problem explores the product topology, asking you to determine the compactness of a product of two infinite spaces, each equipped with the cofinite topology.

We will check if it is compact and if it is Hausdorff.\n\nA space is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover. Let $\\mathcal{U} = \\{U_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha \\in A}$ be an arbitrary open cover of $X$. Since $\\mathcal{U}$ is a cover, it must contain at least one non-empty open set. Let's pick one such set, say $U_{\\alpha_0} \\in \\mathcal{U}$. By the definition of the cofinite topology, since $U_{\\alpha_0}$ is non-empty, its complement $X \\setminus U_{\\alpha_0}$ must be a finite set. Let this finite set be $F = \\{n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_k\\}$. Since $\\mathcal{U}$ is a cover for all of $X$, for each element $n_i \\in F$, there must exist an open set $U_{\\alpha_i} \\in \\mathcal{U}$ such that $n_i \\in U_{\\alpha_i}$. Now, consider the finite subcollection of $\\mathcal{U}$ given by $\\{U_{\\alpha_0}, U_{\\alpha_1}, U_{\\alpha_2}, \\ldots, U_{\\alpha_k}\\}$. The set $U_{\\alpha_0}$ covers all of $X$ except for the points in $F$. The sets $U_{\\alpha_1}, \\ldots, U_{\\alpha_k}$ cover all the points in $F$. Therefore, this finite subcollection covers all of $X$. Since our initial open cover $\\mathcal{U}$ was arbitrary, this shows that every open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover. Thus, $X$ is a compact space.\n\nNext, let's determine if $X$ is a Hausdorff (T2) space. A space is Hausdorff if for any two distinct points $x, y$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $x \\in U$ and $y \\in V$. Let $m, n \\in X$ be two distinct points, with $m \\neq n$. Let $U$ be any open set containing $m$ and $V$ be any open set containing $n$. By definition of the cofinite topology, $X \\setminus U$ and $X \\setminus V$ are finite sets. The union of two finite sets is finite, so $(X \\setminus U) \\cup (X \\setminus V)$ is finite. By De Morgan's laws, this union is equal to $X \\setminus (U \\cap V)$. Since $X \\setminus (U \\cap V)$ is finite and $X$ is infinite, the intersection $U \\cap V$ must be infinite, and therefore non-empty. This means that no two non-empty open sets in $X$ are disjoint. Consequently, $X$ is not a Hausdorff space.\n\nNow we can evaluate each of the given statements about the product space $Y = X \\times X$.\n\nStatement D: The diagonal set $\\Delta = \\{(n, n) \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ is a closed set in $Y$.\nA standard theorem in topology states that a space $Z$ is Hausdorff if and only if the diagonal set is closed in the product space $Z \\times Z$. We have already shown that the space $X$ is not Hausdorff. Therefore, the diagonal set $\\Delta$ is not closed in $Y = X \\times X$. Thus, statement D is false.\n\nStatement A: $Y$ is compact.\nTychonoff's theorem, a fundamental result in topology, states that the product of any collection of compact topological spaces is compact with respect to the product topology. We have proven that the space $X$ is compact. The space $Y = X \\times X$ is the product of two compact spaces. Therefore, by Tychonoff's theorem, $Y$ is compact. Thus, statement A is true.\n\nStatement C: $Y$ is not countably compact.\nA space is defined as countably compact if every countable open cover has a finite subcover. A key property relating compactness and countable compactness is that every compact space is also countably compact. Since we have established that $Y$ is compact, it must also be countably compact. Therefore, the statement that $Y$ is not countably compact is false.\n\nStatement B: $Y$ is countably compact, but not compact.\nThis statement claims that $Y$ is not compact. However, as shown in the analysis of statement A, $Y$ is a compact space. Therefore, statement B is false.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the only true statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1547181"}, {"introduction": "Advanced mathematical practice involves not just solving problems, but evaluating the truth of abstract propositions.
