A function $f: X \\to Y$ is continuous if for every open set $U$ in the codomain $Y$, its preimage $f^{-1}(U)$ is an open set in the domain $X$. To show that $f$ is not continuous, we only need to find one counterexample: an open set $U$ in the codomain $(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_L)$ whose preimage is not open in the domain $(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_u)$.\n\nLet's consider a basis element for the lower limit topology $\\mathcal{T}_L$, as any basis element is by definition an open set. Let's choose the set $U = [1, 2)$. This set is open in $(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_L)$.\n\nNow, we must find the preimage of this set under the function $f$. The preimage $f^{-1}(U)$ is the set of all points $x$ in the domain $(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_u)$ such that $f(x)$ is in $U$.\n$$f^{-1}(U) = f^{-1}([1, 2)) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid f(x) \\in [1, 2)\\}$$\nSubstituting the definition of $f(x)$, we get:\n$$f^{-1}([1, 2)) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid |x| \\in [1, 2)\\}$$\nThe condition $|x| \\in [1, 2)$ is equivalent to the inequality $1 \\le |x|  2$.

If $x  0$, the inequality becomes $1 \\le -x  2$. Multiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequalities, giving $-2  x \\le -1$. This gives the interval $(-2, -1]$.\n\nCombining these two cases, the preimage is the union of these two disjoint sets:\n$$f^{-1}([1, 2)) = (-2, -1] \\cup [1, 2)$$\nNow we must determine if this set, let's call it $V = (-2, -1] \\cup [1, 2)$, is an open set in the domain space, which has the standard topology $(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_u)$. A set is open in the standard topology if, for every point in the set, there exists an open interval centered at that point which is entirely contained within the set.\n\nLet's examine the point $x = -1$, which is in $V$. For $V$ to be open in the standard topology, there must exist an open interval $(a, b)$ such that $-1 \\in (a, b)$ and $(a, b) \\subset V$. Any such open interval containing $-1$ must be of the form $(-1-\\epsilon, -1+\\delta)$ for some positive values $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$. However, for any $\\epsilon  0$, this interval contains points between $-1-\\epsilon$ and $-1$. These points are not in $V$, since the part of $V$ near $-1$ is $(-2, -1]$. For example, the point $-1 - \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}$ is in $(-1-\\epsilon, -1+\\delta)$ but not in $V$. Therefore, no open interval containing $-1$ is a subset of $V$.\n\nSince the point $-1$ is in $V$ but is not an interior point of $V$ with respect to the standard topology, the set $V = f^{-1}([1, 2))$ is not an open set in $(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_u)$.\n\nWe have found an open set $U = [1, 2)$ in the codomain $(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_L)$ whose preimage $f^{-1}(U)$ is not open in the domain $(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_u)$.
