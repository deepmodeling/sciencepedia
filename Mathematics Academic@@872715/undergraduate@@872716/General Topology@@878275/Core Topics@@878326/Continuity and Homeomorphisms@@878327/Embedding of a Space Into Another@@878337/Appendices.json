To be an embedding, in addition, the inverse $f^{-1}:f(X)\\to X$ must be continuous; a sufficient criterion here is that the family of subspaces $\\{f(S_{n}^{1})\\}$ is pairwise disjoint and locally discrete, so that near any point of $f(S_{n}^{1})$ one can find a neighborhood intersecting no other $f(S_{m}^{1})$.\n\nOption A: $f(n,\\mathbf{u})=(3n,0)+\\mathbf{u}$. For each fixed $n$, the restriction $f|_{S_{n}^{1}}:\\mathbf{u}\\mapsto (3n,0)+\\mathbf{u}$ is a translation, hence a homeomorphism of $S^{1}$ onto the Euclidean circle of radius $1$ centered at $(3n,0)$. For $n\\neq m$, the circles have centers at distance $3|n-m|\\ge 3$ and radius $1$, so the distance between the circles is at least $3|n-m|-2\\ge 1$. Thus the images $f(S_{n}^{1})$ are pairwise disjoint and separated by a positive distance. Consequently, for any $y\\in f(S_{n}^{1})$, the open ball of radius $\\frac{1}{2}$ centered at $y$ intersects $f(X)$ only in $f(S_{n}^{1})$. If $U\\subseteq X$ is open, then $U\\cap S_{n}^{1}$ is open in $S_{n}^{1}$ for each $n$, and since $f|_{S_{n}^{1}}$ is a homeomorphism onto $f(S_{n}^{1})$, the set $f(U)\\cap f(S_{n}^{1})$ is open in $f(S_{n}^{1})$. Using the separation, for each $y\\in f(U)$, there exists an open ball $B$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with $B\\cap f(X)\\subseteq f(S_{n}^{1})$ and $B\\cap f(X)\\subseteq f(U)$. Hence $f(U)$ is open in $f(X)$, and the inverse $f^{-1}$ is continuous. Therefore A defines an embedding.\n\nOption B: $f(n,\\mathbf{u})=(1.5n,0)+\\mathbf{u}$.

Any neighborhood of $u_{-}$ in $S^{1}$ contains points with angles $\\theta\\pi$, whose images lie arbitrarily close to $(3n-1,0)$, at distance $5$ from $(3n-1,5)$, hence outside $B$.
