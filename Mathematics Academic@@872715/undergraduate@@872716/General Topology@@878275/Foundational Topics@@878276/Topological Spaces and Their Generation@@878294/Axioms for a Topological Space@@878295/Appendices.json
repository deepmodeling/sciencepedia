A fundamental property of sequences of real numbers is that a convergent sequence has a unique limit. Therefore, no sequence can converge to two different limits $L_i$ and $L_j$. This means the intersection $S_{L_i} \\cap S_{L_j}$ is empty, and consequently, the entire intersection $\\bigcap_{i=1}^{k} S_{L_i}$ is the empty set $\\emptyset$.

For example, the divergent sequence $(0, 1, 0, 1, \\dots)$ does not converge to either 1 or 2, so it is not in $U$.\n    - Can $U$ be equal to $S_L$ for some $L \\in \\mathbb{R}$? If $U = S_L$, then every sequence in $U$ must converge to $L$. The sequence $(1, 1, 1, \\dots)$ is in $S_1 \\subseteq U$, so it must converge to $L$. This implies $L=1$. The sequence $(2, 2, 2, \\dots)$ is in $S_2 \\subseteq U$, so it must also converge to $L$. This implies $L=2$.
