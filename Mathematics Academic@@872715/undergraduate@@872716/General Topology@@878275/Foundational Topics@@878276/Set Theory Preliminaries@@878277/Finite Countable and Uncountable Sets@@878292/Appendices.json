This first exercise provides a concrete, hands-on look at this fundamental idea.

Each flag is identified by a unique positive integer from the set of natural numbers, $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$. For any given state, the set of active flags must be finite.

This holds because finite Cartesian products of countable sets are countable. Specifically, $\\mathbb{N}\\times \\mathbb{N}$ is countable (e.g., by enumerating pairs along antidiagonals), and by induction on $k$, $\\mathbb{N}^{k}$ is countable for every finite $k$. Since $T_{k}$ is a subset of a countable set, $T_{k}$ is countable, and hence $\\mathcal{F}_{k}$ is countable for each $k\\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\mathcal{F}$ is a countable union of countable sets:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}=\\bigcup_{k\\in \\{0\\}\\cup \\mathbb{N}} \\mathcal{F}_{k},\n$$\nso $\\mathcal{F}$ is countable.\n\nCombining this with the earlier injection $\\mathbb{N}\\to \\mathcal{F}$ showing $\\mathcal{F}$ is infinite, we conclude that $\\mathcal{F}$ is countably infinite.
