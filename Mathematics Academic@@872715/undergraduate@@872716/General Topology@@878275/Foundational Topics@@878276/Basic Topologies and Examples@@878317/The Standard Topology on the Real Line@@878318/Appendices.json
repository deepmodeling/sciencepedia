By definition, for a subset $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, the boundary is $\\partial S = \\overline{S} \\cap \\overline{\\mathbb{R} \\setminus S}$. We take $S = \\mathbb{I}$, the set of irrational numbers, and analyze $\\overline{\\mathbb{I}}$ and $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$.\n\nFirst, we show that every nonempty open interval $(a,b)$ contains a rational number. By the Archimedean property, choose $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $n(b-a)  1$. Then there exists $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ with $na  m  nb$. Dividing by $n$ gives $a  \\frac{m}{n}  b$, so $(a,b) \\cap \\mathbb{Q} \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nNext, we show that every nonempty open interval $(a,b)$ contains an irrational number. Fix any irrational $c \\neq 0$. From the previous step, pick $r \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\cap (a,b)$. Choose $t \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ with\n$$\n0  t  \\min\\left\\{\\frac{r-a}{|c|}, \\frac{b-r}{|c|}\\right\\}.\n$$\nThen $|t c|  \\min\\{r-a, b-r\\}$, hence $r - |t c|  a$ and $r + |t c|  b$.
