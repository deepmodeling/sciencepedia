Let $U$ be any open neighborhood of $p$. By the definition of the basis for the order topology, there exists a basis element $B$ such that $p \\in B \\subseteq U$. A basis element containing $p$ is an open interval of points in $X$. Let's denote this interval as $((a,b), (c,d))$. Thus, $(a,b)  (x,y)  (c,d)$.

Let $q_2$ be any rational number in $[0,1]$, for instance, $q_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$. Then the point $p' = (q_1, q_2)$ is in $S$. We check if $p'$ lies in the interval $((a,b),(c,d))$.\nSince $a  q_1$, we have $(a,b)  (q_1, q_2)$.\nSince $q_1  x$, we have $(q_1, q_2)  (x,y)$.\nThus, $(a,b)  p'  (x,y)  (c,d)$, which means $p' \\in ((a,b), (c,d))$. So the neighborhood $U$ contains a point from $S$.\n\nSub-case 1.2: $a = x$.\nIn this case, the condition $(a,b)  (x,y)$ becomes $(x,b)  (x,y)$, which implies $b  y$. (This sub-case is not possible if $y=0$, but then we must have $ax$ unless $p$ is the minimal element $(0,0)$, which is in $S$ anyway). Since $y  b$ and the rationals are dense, we can choose a rational number $q_2$ such that $b  q_2  y$.\nConsider the point $p' = (x, q_2)$. Since $x$ is rational (by our case assumption) and $q_2$ is rational, $p' \\in S$.\nWe check if $p'$ lies in the interval $((a,b),(c,d)) = ((x,b),(c,d))$.\nSince $b  q_2$, we have $(x,b)  (x,q_2)$.\nSince $q_2  y$, we have $(x,q_2)  (x,y)$.\nThus, $(x,b)  p'  (x,y)  (c,d)$, which means $p' \\in ((x,b), (c,d))$. So the neighborhood $U$ contains a point from $S$.\n\nA similar argument holds if $(x,y)(c,d)$ implies $xc$ or $x=c$. If $xc$, we find a rational between them. If $x=c$, then $yd$, and we find a rational between $y$ and $d$. The special cases for endpoints of $X$ like $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$ also satisfy the condition (e.g., $(0,0)$ is in $S$).\nTherefore, every point $(x,y)$ with a rational first coordinate $x$ is in the closure of $S$. This means the set $\\mathbb{Q}_{[0,1]} \\times [0,1]$ is a subset of $\\text{Cl}(S)$.\n\n**Case 2: $x$ is an irrational number ($x \\in \\mathbb{I}_{[0,1]}$)**\n\nLet $p=(x,y)$ be a point in $X$ where $x$ is irrational.\n\nSub-case 2.1: $y \\in (0,1)$.\nConsider the open interval $U = ((x,0), (x,1))$. By definition of the lexicographic order, a point $(u,v) \\in X$ is in $U$ if and only if $(x,0)  (u,v)  (x,1)$. This implies $u$ must be equal to $x$. So, $U = \\{x\\} \\times (0,1)$. The point $p=(x,y)$ is in this set $U$.\nEvery point in $U$ has an irrational first coordinate $x$. The set $S$ only contains points with rational coordinates. Therefore, $U \\cap S = \\emptyset$.\nSince we found an open neighborhood of $p$ that does not intersect $S$, the point $p=(x,y)$ with $x$ irrational and $y \\in (0,1)$ is not in the closure of $S$.\n\nSub-case 2.2: $y=0$.\nLet $p=(x,0)$ with $x$ irrational. Let $U$ be any open neighborhood of $p$. Then $U$ contains a basis interval of the form $((a,b), (c,d))$ containing $p$. For $(a,b)  (x,0)$, it must be that $a  x$.\nSince the rationals are dense in the reals, we can find a rational number $q_1$ such that $a  q_1  x$. Let $q_2=\\frac{1}{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. The point $p'=(q_1,q_2)$ is in $S$.\nSince $a  q_1$, we have $(a,b)  (q_1, q_2)$. Since $q_1  x$, we have $(q_1, q_2)  (x,0)$.\nSo, $(a,b)  p'  (x,0)  (c,d)$, implying $p' \\in U$.\nEvery neighborhood of $(x,0)$ intersects $S$, so $(x,0)$ is in the closure for irrational $x$.\n\nSub-case 2.3: $y=1$.\nLet $p=(x,1)$ with $x$ irrational. Let $U$ be any open neighborhood of $p$. Then $U$ contains a basis interval $((a,b), (c,d))$ containing $p$. For $(x,1)  (c,d)$, it must be that $x  c$.\nSince the rationals are dense, we can find a rational number $q_1$ such that $x  q_1  c$. Let $q_2=\\frac{1}{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. The point $p'=(q_1,q_2)$ is in $S$.\nSince $q_1  x$, we have $(x,1)  (q_1, q_2)$. Since $q_1  c$, we have $(q_1, q_2)  (c,d)$.\nSo, $(a,b)  (x,1)  p'  (c,d)$, implying $p' \\in U$.\nEvery neighborhood of $(x,1)$ intersects $S$, so $(x,1)$ is in the closure for irrational $x$.\n\nFrom Case 2, we conclude that for an irrational $x$, the point $(x,y)$ is in $\\text{Cl}(S)$ if and only if $y=0$ or $y=1$. This gives the set $\\mathbb{I}_{[0,1]} \\times \\{0,1\\}$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the results from both cases, the closure of $S$ is the union of the sets found:\n$\\text{Cl}(S) = (\\mathbb{Q}_{[0,1]} \\times [0,1]) \\cup (\\mathbb{I}_{[0,1]} \\times \\{0,1\\})$.\nThis matches option E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1561273"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice explores a counter-intuitive property of subspaces in the lexicographically ordered plane, $\\mathbb{R}^2$.
