Specifically, we need to check if $f$ is bijective and if both $f$ and its inverse $f^{-1}$ are continuous.\n\nFirst, let's check if $f$ is bijective.\nA function is bijective if it is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).\n- **Injectivity**: Suppose $f(n_1) = f(n_2)$ for some integers $n_1, n_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. By definition of $f$, this means $n_1 + 1 = n_2 + 1$. Subtracting 1 from both sides gives $n_1 = n_2$. Thus, $f$ is injective.\n- **Surjectivity**: Let $m$ be an arbitrary integer in the codomain $\\mathbb{Z}$. We need to find an integer $n$ in the domain such that $f(n) = m$. This requires $n+1 = m$, which implies $n = m-1$. Since $m$ is an integer, $m-1$ is also an integer. So, for any $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, there exists $n = m-1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $f(n) = m$. Thus, $f$ is surjective.\nSince $f$ is both injective and surjective, it is bijective. This immediately rules out option D. The inverse function $f^{-1}: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ exists and is given by $f^{-1}(m) = m-1$.\n\nNext, let's check if $f$ is continuous.\nA function $f: (\\mathbb{Z}, \\tau) \\to (\\mathbb{Z}, \\tau)$ is continuous if for every open set $U$ in the codomain, its preimage $f^{-1}(U)$ is an open set in the domain.\nLet $U$ be an open set in the codomain $(\\mathbb{Z}, \\tau)$.\n- Case 1: $U = \\emptyset$. The preimage is $f^{-1}(\\emptyset) = \\emptyset$. The empty set is open by definition of $\\tau$.\n- Case 2: $U \\neq \\emptyset$. Since $U$ is open, its complement $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus U$ is a finite set. Let's denote this finite set by $C$, so $C = \\{c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k\\}$ for some integers $c_i$.\nFor the preimage $f^{-1}(U)$ to be open, its complement, $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus f^{-1}(U)$, must be a finite set. Using set theory identities, we have $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus f^{-1}(U) = f^{-1}(\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus U)$.\nSo, we need to check if $f^{-1}(\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus U) = f^{-1}(C)$ is finite.\nThe inverse function is $f^{-1}(m) = m-1$. Applying this to the set $C$, we get:\n$$f^{-1}(C) = \\{f^{-1}(c) \\mid c \\in C\\} = \\{c-1 \\mid c \\in C\\} = \\{c_1-1, c_2-1, \\ldots, c_k-1\\}$$\nSince $C$ is a finite set with $k$ elements, $f^{-1}(C)$ is also a finite set with $k$ elements.\nTherefore, the complement of $f^{-1}(U)$ is finite, which means $f^{-1}(U)$ is an open set in $\\tau$.\nSince the preimage of any open set is open, the function $f$ is continuous. This rules out option C.\n\nFinally, we need to determine if $f$ is a homeomorphism. For $f$ to be a homeomorphism, its inverse $f^{-1}$ must also be continuous. This is equivalent to checking if $f$ is an open map, i.e., if $f$ maps open sets to open sets.\nLet $V$ be an open set in the domain $(\\mathbb{Z}, \\tau)$. We need to determine if its image $f(V)$ is an open set in the codomain.\n- Case 1: $V = \\emptyset$. The image is $f(\\emptyset) = \\emptyset$. The empty set is open.\n- Case 2: $V \\neq \\emptyset$. Since $V$ is open, its complement $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus V$ is a finite set. Let's denote this finite set by $D$, so $D = \\{d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_j\\}$ for some integers $d_i$.\nFor the image $f(V)$ to be open, its complement, $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus f(V)$, must be a finite set.\nSince $f$ is a bijection, the image of the complement is the complement of the image: $f(\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus V) = \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus f(V)$.\nSo, we have $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus f(V) = f(\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus V) = f(D)$.\nWe need to check if $f(D)$ is a finite set. The function is $f(n) = n+1$. Applying this to the set $D$:\n$$f(D) = \\{f(d) \\mid d \\in D\\} = \\{d+1 \\mid d \\in D\\} = \\{d_1+1, d_2+1, \\ldots, d_j+1\\}$$\nSince $D$ is a finite set with $j$ elements, $f(D)$ is also a finite set with $j$ elements.\nTherefore, the complement of $f(V)$ is finite, which means $f(V)$ is an open set in $\\tau$.\nSince $f$ maps any open set to an open set, $f$ is an open map. This implies that its inverse, $f^{-1}$, is continuous.\n\nWe have shown that $f$ is bijective, continuous, and has a continuous inverse. By definition, $f$ is a homeomorphism. This rules out option B.\n\nThe correct statement is that $f$ is a homeomorphism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1581064"}]}
