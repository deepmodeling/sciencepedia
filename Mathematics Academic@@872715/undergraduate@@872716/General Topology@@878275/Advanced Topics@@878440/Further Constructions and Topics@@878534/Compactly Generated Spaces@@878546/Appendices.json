Proof: Let $X$ be first-countable. Suppose $A \\subseteq X$ has the property that for every compact $K \\subseteq X$, the set $A \\cap K$ is closed in $K$. We show $A$ is closed. Argue by contrapositive: assume $A$ is not closed, so there exists $x \\in \\overline{A} \\setminus A$. Since $X$ is first-countable, there is a sequence $(a_{n})_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ in $A$ with $a_{n} \\to x$. Consider the set $K = \\{x\\} \\cup \\{a_{n} : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.

The finitely many points $a_{0},\\dots,a_{N-1}$ are covered by finitely many members of $\\mathcal{U}$, so $\\mathcal{U}$ has a finite subcover of $K$. Thus $K$ is compact. But then $A \\cap K = \\{a_{n} : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ is not closed in $K$, since $x \\in \\overline{A \\cap K}^{\\,K} \\setminus (A \\cap K)$. This contradicts the assumed property of $A$.

At each $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the family $\\{[x, x + \\frac{1}{n}) : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ is a countable neighborhood base, so $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$ is first-countable (and also Hausdorff, though Hausdorffness is not needed for the argument above).

Compactly generated (k-space).

The space $X$ is compact: given any open cover $\\{U_{i}\\}_{i \\in I}$ of $X$, pick any $U_{i_{0}}$. Its complement $X \\setminus U_{i_{0}}$ is finite, say $\\{x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}\\}$. For each $x_{k}$ choose $U_{i_{k}}$ containing it. Then $\\{U_{i_{0}},U_{i_{1}},\\dots,U_{i_{n}}\\}$ is a finite subcover. For any subset $K \\subseteq X$, the subspace topology on $K$ is again cofinite on $K$, since opens are of the form $K \\cap U$ with $U$ cofinite in $X$, so $K \\setminus (K \\cap U) = K \\cap (X \\setminus U)$ is finite. Hence every subspace $K$ is compact by the same argument. Thus every subset $K \\subseteq X$ is compact.\n\nWe now verify the k-space condition.\n\n(1) If $A$ is closed in $X$, then $A$ is either finite or $A = X$. For any $K \\subseteq X$ (compact), $A \\cap K$ is either finite (hence closed in $K$) or equal to $K$ (also closed).

If $A$ is infinite and $A \\neq X$, pick $x \\in X \\setminus A$ and set $K = A \\cup \\{x\\}$. Then $K$ is compact and $A \\cap K = A$, which is an infinite proper subset of $K$. In the cofinite topology on $K$, a closed subset is finite or equal to $K$, so $A$ is not closed in $K$. This contradicts the assumption. Therefore the only possibilities are that $A$ is finite or $A = X$, i.e., precisely the closed sets in $X$. Hence the space is a k-space. Thus C is true.\n\nD. Not metrizable. Every metric space is Hausdorff: if $d$ is a metric and $x \\neq y$, let $r = d(x,y)$; then the open balls $B(x,\\frac{r}{2})$ and $B(y,\\frac{r}{2})$ are disjoint.

Hence every $x\\neq 0$ is an isolated point.\n- $X\\setminus\\{0\\}$ is open because it does not contain $0$, so $\\{0\\}$ is closed. For $x\\neq 0$, $X\\setminus\\{x\\}$ contains $0$ and its complement $\\{x\\}$ is countable, hence $X\\setminus\\{x\\}$ is open, so $\\{x\\}$ is closed.

We claim that the compact subsets of $(X,\\mathcal{T})$ are exactly the finite subsets.\n\n1. Every finite subset $K\\subseteq X$ is compact. Indeed, given any open cover of $K$, select one open set from the cover containing each point of $K$; since $K$ is finite, this yields a finite subcover.\n\n2. No infinite subset $K\\subseteq X$ is compact.\n- If $0\\notin K$ and $K$ is infinite, then $\\{\\{x\\}:x\\in K\\}$ is an open cover of $K$ with no finite subcover, because any finite subfamily covers only finitely many points of $K$.\n- If $0\\in K$ and $K$ is infinite, let $S$ be any countably infinite subset of $K \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Consider the collection of sets $\\mathcal{C} = \\{ \\{s\\} : s \\in S \\} \\cup \\{ X \\setminus S \\}$. Each singleton $\\{s\\}$ is open because it does not contain $0$. The set $U = X \\setminus S$ is also open, because $0 \\in U$ (since $0 \\notin S$) and its complement $X \\setminus U = S$ is countable. This collection $\\mathcal{C}$ is an open cover of $K$ (and in fact of $X$). However, no finite subcollection of $\\mathcal{C}$ can cover $K$, because it cannot cover the infinite set $S$. Any finite subcollection covers only a finite number of points from $S$. Therefore, $K$ is not compact.\n\nTherefore, the only compact subsets of $(X,\\mathcal{T})$ are finite sets.\n\nNow assess the $k$-space property. In a $k$-space, a set $A\\subseteq X$ is closed if and only if $A\\cap K$ is closed in the subspace $K$ for every compact $K\\subseteq X$. Since in our space the compact subsets are exactly the finite subsets, it suffices to analyze finite $K$.\n\nLet $K\\subseteq X$ be finite. We show that the subspace $K$ is discrete, hence every subset of $K$ is both open and closed in $K$.\n- If $0\\notin K$, then for any $B\\subseteq K$, the set $B$ is open in $X$ (it does not contain $0$), so $B=B\\cap K$ is open in the subspace $K$.\n- If $0\\in K$, then for any $B\\subseteq K$ with $0\\notin B$, $B$ is open in $X$, hence open in $K$.

If $(X,\\mathcal{T})$ were a k-space, this would force every subset $A\\subseteq X$ to be closed in $X$.
