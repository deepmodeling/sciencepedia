## Introduction
In [general topology](@entry_id:152375), we often need to construct new topological spaces from existing ones. While the [initial topology](@entry_id:155801) provides a way to endow a domain with a structure based on maps *from* it, the dual concept—the [final topology](@entry_id:150988)—addresses the question of how to give a [codomain](@entry_id:139336) a natural structure based on maps *into* it. This construction is a powerful tool for unifying several fundamental ideas, answering the problem of how to define the "richest" or "most natural" topology on a set that ensures a given family of maps into it are all continuous. This article provides a comprehensive exploration of final topologies, guiding the reader from first principles to advanced applications.

The article is structured into three main parts. In "Principles and Mechanisms," we will delve into the formal definition of the [final topology](@entry_id:150988), uncover its powerful [universal property](@entry_id:145831), and examine its most important special case: the [quotient topology](@entry_id:150384). "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will demonstrate the utility of this concept, showing how it is used to construct familiar spaces like the circle and sphere, define topologies on infinite-dimensional [vector spaces](@entry_id:136837) in functional analysis, and characterize the structure of [smooth manifolds](@entry_id:160799). Finally, "Hands-On Practices" offers a series of guided problems to solidify your understanding and build practical skills in working with final topologies.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delves into the foundational principles and mechanisms of the [final topology](@entry_id:150988), a crucial construction in [general topology](@entry_id:152375) for endowing a set with a topological structure derived from a family of maps directed into it. We will explore its definition, its powerful [universal property](@entry_id:145831), and its role in unifying fundamental concepts such as [quotient spaces](@entry_id:274314) and direct limits.

### The Definition of the Final Topology

Let $Y$ be a set, and let $\{(X_i, \mathcal{T}_i)\}_{i \in I}$ be an indexed family of [topological spaces](@entry_id:155056). For each index $i \in I$, let $f_i: X_i \to Y$ be a function. The primary goal is to define a topology on $Y$ that is intrinsically linked to the spaces $X_i$ through the maps $f_i$. Specifically, we seek a topology on $Y$ that makes every map $f_i$ continuous.

While many such topologies might exist (for instance, the [indiscrete topology](@entry_id:149604) on $Y$ always makes any map into it continuous), we are interested in the most "natural" or "richest" such topology. This leads to the definition of the **[final topology](@entry_id:150988)**.

The **[final topology](@entry_id:150988)** on $Y$, denoted $\mathcal{T}_F$, induced by the family of maps $\{f_i\}_{i \in I}$, is defined as the **finest topology** (i.e., the one with the most open sets) on $Y$ for which every map $f_i: (X_i, \mathcal{T}_i) \to (Y, \mathcal{T}_F)$ is continuous.

This maximality condition provides a direct and practical characterization of the open sets in $\mathcal{T}_F$. A subset $U \subseteq Y$ is open in $(Y, \mathcal{T}_F)$ if and only if its preimage under each map, $f_i^{-1}(U)$, is an open set in the corresponding space $(X_i, \mathcal{T}_i)$ for all $i \in I$.
$$
\mathcal{T}_F = \{ U \subseteq Y \mid \forall i \in I, f_i^{-1}(U) \in \mathcal{T}_i \}
$$
If this condition were to fail for some set $U$, meaning $f_j^{-1}(U)$ was not open for some $j \in I$, then the map $f_j$ would not be continuous with respect to the topology containing $U$. Therefore, the collection $\mathcal{T}_F$ truly is the largest possible collection of open sets that satisfies our initial requirement.

This definition for open sets naturally extends to a characterization for closed sets. A subset $C \subseteq Y$ is closed if and only if its complement, $Y \setminus C$, is open. Applying the definition of the [final topology](@entry_id:150988), this means $f_i^{-1}(Y \setminus C)$ must be open in $X_i$ for all $i \in I$. Since the [preimage](@entry_id:150899) operation commutes with complements, we have $f_i^{-1}(Y \setminus C) = X_i \setminus f_i^{-1}(C)$. The statement that $X_i \setminus f_i^{-1}(C)$ is open is equivalent to the statement that $f_i^{-1}(C)$ is closed. This leads to a dual characterization: a subset $C \subseteq Y$ is closed in $(Y, \mathcal{T}_F)$ if and only if its [preimage](@entry_id:150899) $f_i^{-1}(C)$ is a [closed set](@entry_id:136446) in $(X_i, \mathcal{T}_i)$ for all $i \in I$ [@problem_id:1553686].

### The Universal Property: A Powerful Tool

The true utility of the [final topology](@entry_id:150988) lies not just in its definition, but in its **[universal property](@entry_id:145831)**. This property describes how the [topological space](@entry_id:149165) $(Y, \mathcal{T}_F)$ relates to all other topological spaces.

Let $(Y, \mathcal{T}_F)$ be the space equipped with the [final topology](@entry_id:150988) induced by the family $\{f_i: X_i \to Y\}_{i \in I}$. For any [topological space](@entry_id:149165) $(Z, \mathcal{T}_Z)$, a function $g: Y \to Z$ is continuous if and only if the composition of maps $g \circ f_i: (X_i, \mathcal{T}_i) \to (Z, \mathcal{T}_Z)$ is continuous for all $i \in I$.

This property is a direct consequence of the definition. If $g$ is continuous, then since each $f_i$ is continuous by construction, the composition $g \circ f_i$ is also continuous. Conversely, assume that $g \circ f_i$ is continuous for all $i \in I$. To show that $g$ is continuous, we must show that for any open set $V \subseteq Z$, the [preimage](@entry_id:150899) $g^{-1}(V)$ is open in $(Y, \mathcal{T}_F)$. By the definition of the [final topology](@entry_id:150988), this is equivalent to checking if $f_i^{-1}(g^{-1}(V))$ is open in $X_i$ for all $i$. But this [preimage](@entry_id:150899) is precisely $(g \circ f_i)^{-1}(V)$, which is open by our assumption that the composite map is continuous. Therefore, $g$ is continuous.

This universal property provides a powerful "test" for the continuity of maps *from* a space equipped with a [final topology](@entry_id:150988).

### The Quotient Topology: A Fundamental Application

Perhaps the most important and common instance of a [final topology](@entry_id:150988) is the **[quotient topology](@entry_id:150384)**. Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ be a topological space, and let $\sim$ be an [equivalence relation](@entry_id:144135) on the set $X$. Let $Y = X/\sim$ be the set of [equivalence classes](@entry_id:156032). The canonical projection map, $\pi: X \to Y$, sends each element $x \in X$ to its equivalence class $[x] \in Y$.

The **[quotient topology](@entry_id:150384)** on $Y$ is defined as the [final topology](@entry_id:150988) induced by the single, surjective map $\pi: X \to Y$.

From our general definition, this means a subset $U \subseteq Y$ is open if and only if its [preimage](@entry_id:150899) $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is an open set in $X$. Similarly, a subset $C \subseteq Y$ is closed if and only if $\pi^{-1}(C)$ is closed in $X$. The set $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is often called the **saturation** of $U$, as it is the union of all [equivalence classes](@entry_id:156032) that are elements of $U$. Thus, a set in the quotient space is open if and only if its saturation is open in the original space.

The [universal property](@entry_id:145831) of the [final topology](@entry_id:150988) takes on a particularly elegant form for [quotient spaces](@entry_id:274314) [@problem_id:1553717]. Let $Z$ be any [topological space](@entry_id:149165) and let $f: Y \to Z$ be a function. Then $f$ is continuous if and only if the composite map $f \circ \pi: X \to Z$ is continuous. This property is immensely useful, as it allows us to define [continuous maps](@entry_id:153855) on abstract [quotient spaces](@entry_id:274314) like the circle $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ or [projective spaces](@entry_id:157963) by first defining a continuous map on a more familiar space (like $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \setminus \{0\}$) that respects the [equivalence relation](@entry_id:144135).

#### Preservation and Non-Preservation of Topological Properties

A crucial question is which topological properties are inherited by a [quotient space](@entry_id:148218) $Y = X/\sim$ from the original space $X$. Since the canonical map $\pi$ is continuous and surjective by construction, some properties are immediately preserved.

- **Compactness and Connectedness**: The [continuous image of a compact space](@entry_id:265606) is compact, and the continuous image of a connected space is connected. Therefore, if $X$ is compact, $Y$ must be compact. If $X$ is connected, $Y$ must be connected. For instance, consider the space formed by taking the compact interval $X = [-2, 2]$ and identifying all points in the subinterval $(1, 2]$ to a single point. The resulting quotient space $Y$ is the continuous and surjective image of a compact and connected space, and is therefore itself compact and connected [@problem_id:1553661].

However, many other desirable properties, particularly [separation axioms](@entry_id:154482), are often lost in the transition to a [quotient space](@entry_id:148218).

- **The $T_1$ and Hausdorff ($T_2$) Properties**: A space is **$T_1$** if every singleton set is closed. For a quotient space $Y=X/\sim$, a singleton set $\{[x]\} \subseteq Y$ is closed if and only if its preimage, the equivalence class $[x]$ itself, is a closed set in $X$. Therefore, $Y$ is a $T_1$ space if and only if every equivalence class is a closed subset of $X$ [@problem_id:1553708].

The Hausdorff property is even more fragile. A quotient of a Hausdorff space is not necessarily Hausdorff. Consider the example from [@problem_id:1553661] again. The original space $X = [-2, 2]$ is Hausdorff. The [equivalence class](@entry_id:140585) corresponding to the collapsed interval is $(1, 2]$. This set is not closed in $X$, so the quotient space $Y$ is not even $T_1$, and therefore cannot be Hausdorff.

A canonical example illustrating the loss of the Hausdorff property is the "[line with two origins](@entry_id:162106)" [@problem_id:1553731]. Let $X$ be the disjoint union of two real lines, $X = (\mathbb{R} \times \{0\}) \cup (\mathbb{R} \times \{1\})$, which is a Hausdorff space. Define an equivalence relation by identifying $(x, 0) \sim (x, 1)$ for all non-zero $x \in \mathbb{R}$. The [quotient space](@entry_id:148218) $Y = X/\sim$ effectively glues the two lines together at every point except the origin. In $Y$, the two distinct points $p_0 = [(0,0)]$ and $p_1 = [(0,1)]$ cannot be separated by [disjoint open sets](@entry_id:150704). Any open neighborhood of $p_0$ must contain an open interval around $(0,0)$ on the first line. Due to the identification, this forces the neighborhood in $Y$ to contain points originating from the second line that are arbitrarily close to $(0,1)$. Symmetrically, any open neighborhood of $p_1$ must contain points originating from the first line. Consequently, any pair of neighborhoods of $p_0$ and $p_1$ will inevitably intersect, proving that $Y$ is not Hausdorff.

### General Properties of Final Topologies

We now return to the general case of a [final topology](@entry_id:150988) induced by a family of maps $\{f_i: X_i \to Y\}_{i \in I}$.

- **Connectedness**: If all source spaces $X_i$ are connected, is the resulting space $(Y, \mathcal{T}_F)$ also connected? Not necessarily. The continuous image $f_i(X_i)$ of each space is a connected subspace of $Y$, but their union might not be. To ensure the connectivity of $Y$, two additional conditions are sufficient [@problem_id:1553678]. First, the family of maps must be **jointly surjective**, meaning $Y = \bigcup_{i \in I} f_i(X_i)$. This prevents $Y$ from being disconnected simply by having isolated points outside the images. Second, the images must have a point in common, i.e., $\bigcap_{i \in I} f_i(X_i) \neq \emptyset$. Under these two conditions, $Y$ is a union of [connected subspaces](@entry_id:151666) that all share at least one point, which guarantees that the total space $Y$ is connected.

- **Path-Connectedness**: The inheritance of [path-connectedness](@entry_id:142695) is more subtle and depends heavily on the specific nature of the maps. Consider a set $Y_A=\{p, q\}$. Let $f_1: [0, 1] \to Y_A$ be the constant map $f_1(x) = p$ and $f_2: [2, 3] \to Y_A$ be the constant map $f_2(x) = q$. The [final topology](@entry_id:150988) on $Y_A$ makes both singletons $\{p\}$ and $\{q\}$ open, resulting in the [discrete topology](@entry_id:152622), which is not path-connected. Contrast this with another construction on $Y_B = \{u, v, w\}$ with maps from intervals that overlap in their images. It is possible to construct maps such that the resulting topology on $Y_B$ is not discrete and, in fact, allows for [continuous paths](@entry_id:187361) to be defined between any two points, making it path-connected [@problem_id:1553703]. This shows that [path-connectedness](@entry_id:142695) cannot be guaranteed by a simple theorem and requires careful analysis of the induced open sets.

- **Indiscrete Topology**: At the other extreme from the discrete topology, it is possible for the [final topology](@entry_id:150988) to be the **[indiscrete topology](@entry_id:149604)** $\{\emptyset, Y\}$, even when the source spaces are non-indiscrete. This occurs when the maps $\{f_i\}$ are configured such that for any proper non-empty subset of $Y$, at least one of its preimages is not open. For instance, let $X=\{0, 1\}$ have the Sierpinski topology $\mathcal{T}_S = \{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{0, 1\}\}$, and let $Y = \{a, b\}$. If we define $f_1: X \to Y$ by $f_1(0)=a, f_1(1)=b$ and $f_2: X \to Y$ by $f_2(0)=b, f_2(1)=a$, then the [preimage](@entry_id:150899) $f_1^{-1}(\{a\})=\{0\}$ is not open. This prevents $\{a\}$ from being open in $Y$. Similarly, $f_2^{-1}(\{b\})=\{0\}$ is not open, which prevents $\{b\}$ from being open in $Y$. The result is the [indiscrete topology](@entry_id:149604) on $Y$ [@problem_id:1553658].

### Advanced Topics and Interconnections

The [final topology](@entry_id:150988) possesses deep structural properties that connect it to other areas of topology.

#### Composition and Final Topologies

Consider a composition of maps $Z \xrightarrow{g} X \xrightarrow{f} Y$. We can define two final topologies on $Y$: $\mathcal{T}_f$ induced by $f:(X, \mathcal{T}_X) \to Y$, and $\mathcal{T}_{f \circ g}$ induced by the composite map $f \circ g: (Z, \mathcal{T}_Z) \to Y$. What is the relationship between these two topologies?

If $g$ is continuous, then for any set $U$ that is open in $\mathcal{T}_f$, we know $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$. Since $g$ is continuous, $g^{-1}(f^{-1}(U)) = (f \circ g)^{-1}(U)$ is open in $Z$. This implies $U$ is also open in $\mathcal{T}_{f \circ g}$, so $\mathcal{T}_f \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{f \circ g}$.

The reverse inclusion, $\mathcal{T}_{f \circ g} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_f$, is more demanding. It requires that for any subset $V \subseteq X$, if $g^{-1}(V)$ is open in $Z$, then $V$ must be open in $X$. For this to hold for any choice of $f$, the map $g$ must also be surjective. A continuous, surjective map where $V \subseteq X$ is open if and only if $g^{-1}(V)$ is open in $Z$ is precisely the definition of a **[quotient map](@entry_id:140877)**. Therefore, the equality $\mathcal{T}_f = \mathcal{T}_{f \circ g}$ holds for all functions $f$ if and only if $g$ is a [quotient map](@entry_id:140877) [@problem_id:1553724]. This provides a profound characterization: quotient maps are exactly those maps that preserve the [final topology](@entry_id:150988) structure under composition.

#### Relationship with Initial Topologies

The [final topology](@entry_id:150988) has a dual concept, the **[initial topology](@entry_id:155801)**, which is the *coarsest* topology on a domain space that makes a family of maps leaving it continuous. A fascinating connection emerges when we compare the [quotient topology](@entry_id:150384) on a set $Y$ with an [initial topology](@entry_id:155801) constructed on the same set.

Let $\pi: X \to Y$ be a surjective map, and let $\mathcal{T}_Q$ be the corresponding [quotient topology](@entry_id:150384) on $Y$. Now, consider the family $\mathcal{F}$ of all real-valued functions $g: Y \to \mathbb{R}$ such that the composition $g \circ \pi: X \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous. By the [universal property](@entry_id:145831) of the [quotient topology](@entry_id:150384), this family $\mathcal{F}$ is precisely the set of all real-valued continuous functions on $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Q)$.

Let $\mathcal{T}_I$ be the [initial topology](@entry_id:155801) on $Y$ generated by this family $\mathcal{F}$. By definition, $\mathcal{T}_I$ is the [coarsest topology](@entry_id:149974) on $Y$ making every function in $\mathcal{F}$ continuous. Since every function in $\mathcal{F}$ is already continuous with respect to $\mathcal{T}_Q$, it follows immediately that $\mathcal{T}_I \subseteq \mathcal{T}_Q$.

When does equality hold? The equality $\mathcal{T}_I = \mathcal{T}_Q$ holds if and only if the original [quotient topology](@entry_id:150384) $\mathcal{T}_Q$ can be completely determined by its continuous real-valued functions. This is the defining characteristic of a **completely regular** space. A space is completely regular if for any [closed set](@entry_id:136446) $C$ and any point $y \notin C$, there exists a continuous function to $[0,1]$ that separates them. This property is precisely what is needed to ensure that every open set in $\mathcal{T}_Q$ can be constructed from open sets in $\mathcal{T}_I$. Thus, we have the remarkable result that $\mathcal{T}_I = \mathcal{T}_Q$ if and only if the quotient space $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Q)$ is completely regular [@problem_id:1553727]. This connects the categorical definition of the [final topology](@entry_id:150988) to the [separation axioms](@entry_id:154482) that govern the richness of a space's collection of continuous functions.
