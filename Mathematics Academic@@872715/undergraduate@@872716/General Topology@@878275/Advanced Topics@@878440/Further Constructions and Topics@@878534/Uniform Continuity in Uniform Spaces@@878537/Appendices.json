As $k$ ranges over all elements of the neighborhood $U$, $u=k^{-1}$ ranges over all elements of the set $U^{-1} = \\{x^{-1} \\mid x \\in U\\}$. Since the inversion map $i(g) = g^{-1}$ is a homeomorphism in a topological group, $U^{-1}$ is also an open neighborhood of the identity $e$.\nThus, the condition for uniform continuity of inversion is equivalent to:\nFor every open neighborhood $V$ of $e$, there exists an open neighborhood $U'$ of $e$ (we can rename it to $U$) such that for all $g \\in G$ and for all $u \\in U$, we have $gug^{-1} \\in V$.

We compute the conjugate element $gug^{-1}$:\n$g^{-1} = (1/c, -d/c)$.\n$gug^{-1} = (c,d) \\circ (a,b) \\circ (1/c, -d/c)$\n$= (ca, cb+d) \\circ (1/c, -d/c)$\n$= (ca \\cdot 1/c, ca(-d/c) + cb+d)$\n$= (a, -ad + bc + d) = (a, bc + d(1-a))$.\n\nSo, for $u=(a,b) \\in U_\\epsilon$, we have $gug^{-1} = (a', b')$, where $a' = a$ and $b' = bc + d(1-a)$.\nWe want to show that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, we can find $u \\in U_\\epsilon$ and $g \\in G$ such that $gug^{-1} \\notin V$.\nFor $u=(a,b) \\in U_\\epsilon$, we have $|a-1| < \\epsilon$. Let's assume $\\epsilon < 1/2$. Then for the conjugate point $(a',b')$, we have $|a'-1| = |a-1| < \\epsilon < 1/2$. This means the first condition to be in $V$ is always satisfied for elements in the image of the conjugation.\nTherefore, to show $gug^{-1} \\notin V$, we must show that we can make the second component $|b'| = |bc + d(1-a)| \\ge 1$.\n\nLet's make a strategic choice for $u \\in U_\\epsilon$ and $g \\in G$. For any given $\\epsilon > 0$, choose the element $u = (1-\\epsilon/2, 0) \\in U_\\epsilon$. For this choice, $a=1-\\epsilon/2$ and $b=0$. The term $1-a = 1 - (1-\\epsilon/2) = \\epsilon/2$.\nThe second component of the conjugate becomes $b' = 0 \\cdot c + d(1-(1-\\epsilon/2)) = d(\\epsilon/2)$.\nWe want to make $|b'| \\ge 1$, which means $|d(\\epsilon/2)| \\ge 1$. This is equivalent to $|d| \\ge 2/\\epsilon$.\nWe are free to choose any $g=(c,d) \\in G$. So, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, we can choose $c=1$ and $d = 2/\\epsilon$. This gives an element $g=(1, 2/\\epsilon) \\in G$.\n\nLet's summarize the counterexample:\n1.  Fix the neighborhood $V = \\{ (x,y) \\in G : |x-1| < 1/2, |y| < 1 \\}$.\n2.  Let $U$ be any open neighborhood of $e$. It contains some $U_\\epsilon$ for $\\epsilon>0$. Let's assume $\\epsilon < 1/2$.\n3.  Choose the element $u = (1-\\epsilon/2, 0)$, which is in $U_\\epsilon$ and hence in $U$.\n4.  Choose the group element $g = (1, 2/\\epsilon)$.\n5.  Compute the conjugate: $gug^{-1} = (1-\\epsilon/2, (2/\\epsilon)(\\epsilon/2)) = (1-\\epsilon/2, 1)$.\nThe resulting point $(1-\\epsilon/2, 1)$ has a second component equal to 1. Since $V$ is defined by the strict inequality $|y|<1$, this point is not in $V$.\n\nThis construction shows that for the chosen $V$, for any neighborhood $U$ of the identity, we can find an element $u \\in U$ and an element $g \\in G$ such that $gug^{-1} \\notin V$. Therefore, the condition for uniform continuity of the inversion map is not satisfied.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA is incorrect. While inversion is a homeomorphism, this is a local property and does not guarantee uniform continuity, which is a global property related to the uniform structure.\nB is incorrect. While $G$ is a Lie group, uniform continuity of inversion is not a general property of all Lie groups with respect to the left (or right) uniformity. It is true for the two-sided uniformity, which is generally different.\nC is correct. It precisely describes the failure of the uniform continuity condition, and we have explicitly carried out the construction it suggests.\nD is incorrect. While inversion is uniformly continuous for abelian groups (where $gug^{-1}=u$), it is not *exclusively* for them. For example, all compact topological groups (many of which are non-abelian, like $SO(3)$) have uniformly continuous inversion with respect to either one-sided uniformity.\n\nThus, the correct statement is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1593902"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice problem brings together the threads of topology and uniform structures at a more abstract level.

In other words, we seek the conditions under which $f$ becomes a uniform isomorphism.\n\nLet's first analyze the condition that $f^{-1}: (Y, \\mathcal{V}) \\to (X, \\mathcal{U}_f)$ is uniformly continuous.\nThe universal property of the fine uniformity $\\mathcal{U}_f$ on a space $Z$ states that a function $g$ from $(Z, \\mathcal{U}_f)$ to any uniform space $(W, \\mathcal{W}')$ is uniformly continuous if and only if $g$ is continuous with respect to the induced topologies, i.e., $g: (Z, \\tau_Z) \\to (W, \\tau_{\\mathcal{W}'})$.\nIn our problem, the domain of $f^{-1}$ is $(Y, \\mathcal{V})$ and the codomain is $(X, \\mathcal{U}_f)$. The universal property applies to the *domain* of a function, not the codomain.\nThus, for $f^{-1}: (Y, \\mathcal{V}) \\to (X, \\mathcal{U}_f)$ to be uniformly continuous, we must consider the properties of its domain, $(Y, \\mathcal{V})$.\n\nLet's test the condition proposed in option E:\n1.  $f: (X, \\tau) \\to (Y, \\tau_{\\mathcal{V}})$ is a homeomorphism.\n2.  $\\mathcal{V}$ is the fine uniformity on $Y$ corresponding to $\\tau_{\\mathcal{V}}$, which we denote as $\\mathcal{U}_f(Y)$.\n\nWe want to prove that these two conditions together are necessary and sufficient.\n\n**Sufficiency**: Assume conditions (1) and (2) hold. We want to show that $f^{-1}: (Y, \\mathcal{V}) \\to (X, \\mathcal{U}_f)$ is uniformly continuous.\nSubstituting the assumptions, we are examining the map $f^{-1}: (Y, \\mathcal{U}_f(Y)) \\to (X, \\mathcal{U}_f)$.\nThe domain of this map is $(Y, \\mathcal{U}_f(Y))$, a space endowed with its fine uniformity. By the universal property of the fine uniformity applied to the space $Y$, the map $f^{-1}: (Y, \\mathcal{U}_f(Y)) \\to (X, \\mathcal{U}_f)$ is uniformly continuous if and only if it is continuous as a map of topological spaces, i.e., $f^{-1}: (Y, \\tau_{\\mathcal{V}}) \\to (X, \\tau)$.\nCondition (1) states that $f$ is a homeomorphism, which by definition means that $f^{-1}$ is continuous. Therefore, the condition for uniform continuity of $f^{-1}$ is met.\nThus, condition E is sufficient.\n\n**Necessity**: Assume $f^{-1}: (Y, \\mathcal{V}) \\to (X, \\mathcal{U}_f)$ is uniformly continuous.\nFirst, a uniformly continuous map is always continuous with respect to the induced topologies. So, $f^{-1}: (Y, \\tau_{\\mathcal{V}}) \\to (X, \\tau)$ must be continuous.\nWe are given that $f: (X, \\mathcal{U}_f) \\to (Y, \\mathcal{V})$ is a uniformly continuous bijection. This implies that $f: (X, \\tau) \\to (Y, \\tau_{\\mathcal{V}})$ is a continuous bijection.\nSince both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous, $f$ is a homeomorphism. This shows that the first part of condition E is necessary.\n\nNow we must show that $\\mathcal{V}$ must be the fine uniformity on $Y$.\nSince $f: (X, \\mathcal{U}_f) \\to (Y, \\mathcal{V})$ is a uniform isomorphism, the uniformity $\\mathcal{V}$ must be the one transported from $\\mathcal{U}_f$ by $f$. That is, $\\mathcal{V} = \\{ V \\subseteq Y \\times Y \\mid (f^{-1} \\times f^{-1})(V) \\in \\mathcal{U}_f \\}$. This can be written as $\\mathcal{V} = \\{(f \\times f)(U) \\mid U \\in \\mathcal{U}_f\\}$.\nSince $f: (X, \\tau) \\to (Y, \\tau_{\\mathcal{V}})$ is a homeomorphism, it is known that the image of the fine uniformity on $X$ under $f$ is the fine uniformity on $Y$. That is, $\\{(f \\times f)(U) \\mid U \\in \\mathcal{U}_f\\} = \\mathcal{U}_f(Y)$.\nTherefore, we must have $\\mathcal{V} = \\mathcal{U}_f(Y)$, which means $\\mathcal{V}$ must be the fine uniformity on $Y$ associated with the topology $\\tau_{\\mathcal{V}}$. This shows that the second part of condition E is necessary.\nSince both parts of condition E are necessary, the entire condition E is necessary.\n\nCombining sufficiency and necessity, we conclude that condition E is the correct answer.\n\nLet's briefly analyze why other options are incorrect.\nA. Completeness is not necessary. Consider $X = (0, 1)$ and $Y = \\mathbb{R}$ with their usual topologies and fine uniformities. The function $f(x) = \\tan(\\pi(x - 1/2))$ is a homeomorphism, so it's a uniform isomorphism between the fine uniformities. Here $X$ is not complete, while $Y$ is. We could also map $\\mathbb{R}$ to $(0,1)$, where the target space is not complete.\nB. Compactness of $Y$ is sufficient but not necessary. If $(Y, \\tau_{\\mathcal{V}})$ is compact, then any continuous map from it to a uniform space is uniformly continuous. Since $f$ is a continuous bijection from any space to a compact space, it would be a homeomorphism if $X$ is Hausdorff (which it is, being completely regular). Thus $f^{-1}$ would be continuous. Since $f^{-1}$ is a continuous map from a compact space $(Y, \\tau_{\\mathcal{V}})$, it is uniformly continuous with respect to $\\mathcal{V}$ and any uniformity on $X$. So this is a sufficient condition. However, it's not necessary, as shown by the uniform isomorphism $id: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, where $\\mathbb{R}$ is not compact.\nC. $f$ being a homeomorphism is necessary, as shown above, but not sufficient. If $\\mathcal{V}$ were a strictly coarser uniformity than the fine one $\\mathcal{U}_f(Y)$, then $f: (X, \\mathcal{U}_f) \\to (Y, \\mathcal{U}_f(Y))$ is a uniform isomorphism, but $f^{-1}: (Y, \\mathcal{V}) \\to (X, \\mathcal{U}_f)$ might not be uniformly continuous because $\\mathcal{V}$ has \"fewer\" entourages than $\\mathcal{U}_f(Y)$.\nD. $\\mathcal{V}$ being the fine uniformity is necessary, but not sufficient. If $f$ is not a homeomorphism (i.e., $f^{-1}$ is not continuous), then $f^{-1}$ cannot be uniformly continuous. For example, consider $X = [0, 2\\pi)$ with the usual topology and $Y$ the unit circle $S^1 \\subset \\mathbb{C}$. Both have fine uniformities. The map $f(t) = \\exp(it)$ is a continuous bijection, but its inverse is not continuous at $1 \\in S^1$. Hence $f^{-1}$ is not uniformly continuous.\nF. Compactness of $X$ is a special case of B. If $X$ is compact, then $Y$ is also compact (as the continuous image of a compact space), and $f$ is a homeomorphism. This reduces to the sufficiency argument for B.
