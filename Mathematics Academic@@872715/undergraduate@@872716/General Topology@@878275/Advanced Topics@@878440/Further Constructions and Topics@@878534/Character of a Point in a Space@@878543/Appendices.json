The restriction $q|_{X\\setminus A}:X\\setminus A\\to Y\\setminus\\{p^{*}\\}$ is a homeomorphism, since outside $A$ all equivalence classes are singletons. In each $S_{k}$, the points $(k,1/n)$ are isolated in the subspace topology of $S$, hence $\\{(k,1/n)\\}$ is open in $S_{k}$ and in $X$, and consequently $\\{q(k,1/n)\\}$ is open in $Y$.\n\nHausdorff property: We show $Y$ is Hausdorff.\n- If $y_{1},y_{2}\\in Y\\setminus\\{p^{*}\\}$ with $y_{1}\\neq y_{2}$, then $\\{y_{1}\\}$ and $\\{y_{2}\\}$ are disjoint open neighborhoods separating them.\n- If $y=p^{*}$ and $z\\in Y\\setminus\\{p^{*}\\}$, then $\\{z\\}$ is open in $Y$ because $q^{-1}(\\{z\\})=\\{z\\}$ is open in $X$.

Hence $Y$ is Hausdorff. Therefore option A is false.\n\nFirst-countability at $p^{*}$: Neighborhoods of $p^{*}$ in $Y$ correspond to open sets in $X$ containing $A$. For each $k$, a neighborhood of $p_{k}$ in $S_{k}$ must contain a tail $\\{(k,1/n):n\\geq N_{k}\\}$ for some $N_{k}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$.

In particular, option B is false, and option D’s local-basis claim holds.\n\nSeparability and second-countability: The set $Y$ is countable, since it consists of $p^{*}$ together with the countable set $\\{(k,1/n):k,n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}\\}$. Any countable space is separable (itself is a countable dense subset), so $Y$ is separable. Therefore option C is false. Moreover, any second-countable space is first-countable; since $Y$ is not first-countable, it is not second-countable, which is consistent with rejecting option B.\n\nOpenness of $q$: A quotient map sends saturated open sets to open sets, but it need not be open on arbitrary open sets. Consider the open set $S_{1}\\subset X$. Its image $q(S_{1})$ contains $p^{*}$. If $q(S_{1})$ were open in $Y$, then $q^{-1}(q(S_{1}))=S_{1}\\cup A$ would be open in $X$.

Hence $q(S_{1})$ is not open, and $q$ is not an open map.
