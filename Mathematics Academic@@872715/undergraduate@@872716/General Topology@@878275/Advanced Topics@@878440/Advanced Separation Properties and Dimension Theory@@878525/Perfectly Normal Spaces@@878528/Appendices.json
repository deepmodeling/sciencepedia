Consider a topological space $X$ that is known to be both **regular** and **second-countable**. Recall that a space is regular if for any closed set $C$ and any point $x \\notin C$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $x \\in U$ and $C \\subseteq V$. A space is second-countable if its topology has a countable basis $\\mathcal{B} = \\{B_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$.\n\nIt is a fundamental result that in such a space, every closed set can be expressed as a countable intersection of open sets (i.e., every closed set is a $G_{\\delta}$ set).\n\nLet $C$ be an arbitrary non-empty closed subset of $X$. Which of the following procedures correctly describes a general method to construct a sequence of open sets whose intersection is precisely $C$?\n\nA. For each point $x$ in the complement $X \\setminus C$, use the regularity of $X$ to find an open set $U_x$ containing $x$ and an open set $V_x$ containing $C$ such that $U_x \\cap V_x = \\emptyset$. Recognize that the collection $\\{U_x\\}_{x \\in X \\setminus C}$ is an open cover for $X \\setminus C$. Since $X$ is second-countable and therefore Lindelöf, extract a countable subcover $\\{U_{x_n}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$. The set $C$ is then given by the intersection $\\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} V_{x_n}$, where each $V_{x_n}$ is the open set corresponding to $U_{x_n}$.\n\nB.

The set $C$ is then given by the intersection $\\bigcap_{n \\in \\mathcal{I}} B_n$.", "solution": "We use two facts and apply them step by step. First, regularity: for any closed set $C \\subseteq X$ and any $x \\in X \\setminus C$, there exist disjoint open sets $U_{x}$ and $V_{x}$ such that $x \\in U_{x}$ and $C \\subseteq V_{x}$. Second, second-countable implies Lindelöf: every open cover has a countable subcover.\n\nFix the closed set $C \\neq \\emptyset$. For each $x \\in X \\setminus C$, by regularity choose open sets $U_{x}$ and $V_{x}$ with $x \\in U_{x}$, $C \\subseteq V_{x}$, and $U_{x} \\cap V_{x} = \\emptyset$. Then $\\{U_{x} : x \\in X \\setminus C\\}$ is an open cover of $X \\setminus C$. By Lindelöfness (which follows from second-countability), there is a countable subcover $\\{U_{x_{n}}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$. For each $n$, let $V_{x_{n}}$ be the corresponding open set containing $C$. Consider the countable family of open sets $\\{V_{x_{n}}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$.\n\nWe claim that\n$$\nC = \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} V_{x_{n}}.\n$$\nIndeed, since $C \\subseteq V_{x_{n}}$ for all $n$, we have $C \\subseteq \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} V_{x_{n}}$. Conversely, if $y \\in X \\setminus C$, then $y \\in U_{x_{n}}$ for some $n$ (because $\\{U_{x_{n}}\\}$ covers $X \\setminus C$), hence $y \\notin V_{x_{n}}$ by $U_{x_{n}} \\cap V_{x_{n}} = \\emptyset$. Therefore $y \\notin \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} V_{x_{n}}$, proving the equality. This constructs a sequence of open sets whose intersection is $C$, exactly as required for a $G_{\\delta}$ representation. This is precisely the method described in option A.\n\nNow we examine the other proposed procedures:\n\n- B defines $\\mathcal{J} = \\{n : B_{n} \\subseteq X \\setminus C\\}$ and claims $C = \\bigcap_{n \\in \\mathcal{J}} (X \\setminus B_{n})$. Observe that\n$$\n\\bigcap_{n \\in \\mathcal{J}} (X \\setminus B_{n}) = X \\setminus \\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathcal{J}} B_{n} = X \\setminus \\operatorname{int}(X \\setminus C) = \\operatorname{cl}(C) = C,\n$$\nsince $C$ is closed. While the equality holds, the sets $(X \\setminus B_{n})$ are closed, not open, so this does not provide a $G_{\\delta}$ representation. Hence B does not answer the stated task.\n\n- C uses $\\mathcal{K} = \\{n : C \\subseteq B_{n}\\}$ and claims $C = \\bigcap_{n \\in \\mathcal{K}} B_{n}$. This is generally invalid: there need not exist any single basis element containing all of $C$, so $\\mathcal{K}$ may be empty or the intersection may strictly contain $C$ only in trivial cases; it is not a general method.\n\n- D uses $\\mathcal{I} = \\{n : B_{n} \\cap C \\neq \\emptyset\\}$ and claims $C = \\bigcap_{n \\in \\mathcal{I}} B_{n}$. This is false: for any $x \\in C$, there typically exist basis elements $B_{n}$ intersecting $C$ that avoid $x$, so $x$ would be excluded from the intersection, making the intersection much smaller than $C$.\n\nTherefore, only procedure A correctly and generally constructs a countable sequence of open sets whose intersection equals $C$ in a regular, second-countable space.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1568003"}, {"introduction": "Understanding how topological properties behave under standard constructions like products is a crucial skill.
