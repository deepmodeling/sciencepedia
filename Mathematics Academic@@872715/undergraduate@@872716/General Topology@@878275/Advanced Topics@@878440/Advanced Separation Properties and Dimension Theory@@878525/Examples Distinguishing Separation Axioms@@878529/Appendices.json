This example is fundamental to understanding that properties like normality (separating closed sets) do not imply properties like $T_1$ (separating points), which is why axioms like $T_3$ and $T_4$ are explicitly defined as a combination of regularity/normality and the $T_1$ axiom.", "problem": "Consider the set $X = \\{a, b, c, d\\}$.

The open sets containing $a$ are $\\{a,b\\}$ and $X$. Both of these sets also contain $b$. There is no open set that contains $a$ but not $b$.

To verify directly, consider the point $a$. The set $\\{a\\}$ is not closed because its complement, $\\{b,c,d\\}$, is not an open set (it is not in $\\tau$). Therefore, $(X, \\tau)$ is **not $T_1$**.\n\n**$T_2$ (Hausdorff) Axiom:** A space is $T_2$ if for any pair of distinct points $x, y \\in X$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $x \\in U$ and $y \\in V$.\nSince the space is not $T_1$, it cannot be $T_2$ (as every $T_2$ space is $T_1$). To verify directly, consider the distinct points $a$ and $b$. The only open set containing $a$ (besides $X$) is $U = \\{a,b\\}$. The only open set containing $b$ (besides $X$) is also $V = \\{a,b\\}$. There are no disjoint open sets separating $a$ and $b$.

These are open, $c \\in U$, $\\{a,b\\} \\subseteq V$, and $U \\cap V = \\emptyset$. So the condition holds. The same choice works for $x=d$.\n2. Let $C = \\{c,d\\}$. A point not in $C$ can be $a$ or $b$. Let's pick $x=a$. We need disjoint open sets $U, V$ with $a \\in U$ and $\\{c,d\\} \\subseteq V$.\n   - We can choose $U=\\{a,b\\}$ and $V=\\{c,d\\}$.

The only pair of disjoint non-empty closed sets is $C_1 = \\{a,b\\}$ and $C_2 = \\{c,d\\}$.\n- We need to find disjoint open sets $U_1, U_2$ with $C_1 \\subseteq U_1$ and $C_2 \\subseteq U_2$.\n- Let's choose $U_1 = \\{a,b\\}$ and $U_2 = \\{c,d\\}$.\n- $U_1$ and $U_2$ are both open sets.\n- $C_1 = \\{a,b\\} \\subseteq U_1$.\n- $C_2 = \\{c,d\\} \\subseteq U_2$.\n- $U_1 \\cap U_2 = \\{a,b\\} \\cap \\{c,d\\} = \\emptyset$.\nThe condition is satisfied. Therefore, the space $(X, \\tau)$ **is normal**.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n- A. The space is $T_0$ but not $T_1$. This is false because the space is not $T_0$.\n- B.
