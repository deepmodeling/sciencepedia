The parameter $t \\in [0, 1]$ can be thought of as \"time,\" so the map $f$ is continuously deformed into the map $g$ as time progresses from $t=0$ to $t=1$.

Let $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ be topological spaces. Two continuous maps, $f_0: X \\to Y$ and $f_1: X \\to Y$, are said to be homotopic if there exists a continuous map $H: X \\times [0,1] \\to Y$ satisfying $H(x, 0) = f_0(x)$ and $H(x, 1) = f_1(x)$ for all $x \\in X$. The interval $[0,1]$ is equipped with the standard subspace topology from $\\mathbb{R}$, and $X \\times [0,1]$ has the product topology. The map $H$ is called a homotopy between $f_0$ and $f_1$.\n\nNow, let $g: Z \\to X$ be another continuous map.

The composite maps are defined as $h_0(z) = f_0(g(z))$ and $h_1(z) = f_1(g(z))$.\n\nLet's propose a definition for our desired homotopy $K$. The map $K$ needs to take an input $(z, t) \\in Z \\times [0,1]$ and produce an output in $Y$. We have a map $H$ that produces outputs in $Y$, but it requires an input from $X \\times [0,1]$. We can use the map $g$ to transform the $z$ component of our input into an element of $X$. A natural candidate for $K$ is to apply $g$ to $z$ and then use the result along with $t$ as the input for $H$.\n\nLet's define the map $K: Z \\times [0,1] \\to Y$ by the formula:\n$$K(z, t) = H(g(z), t)$$\n\nNow, we must verify that this map $K$ satisfies the required properties of a homotopy between $h_0$ and $h_1$.\n\nFirst, let's check the condition for $t=0$:\n$$K(z, 0) = H(g(z), 0)$$\nBy the definition of the homotopy $H$, we know that $H(x, 0) = f_0(x)$ for any $x \\in X$.

This map is the composition of the projection $p_Z: Z \\times [0,1] \\to Z$ given by $p_Z(z, t) = z$ (which is continuous) and the map $g: Z \\to X$ (which is given to be continuous). The composition of continuous maps $g \\circ p_Z$ is continuous.\n\nConsider the second composition: $(\\pi_{[0,1]} \\circ \\phi)(z, t) = \\pi_{[0,1]}(g(z), t) = t$. This is simply the projection map $p_{[0,1]}: Z \\times [0,1] \\to [0,1]$, which is continuous by the definition of the product topology.\n\nSince both component maps $\\pi_X \\circ \\phi$ and $\\pi_{[0,1]} \\circ \\phi$ are continuous, the map $\\phi$ is continuous. Therefore, $K = H \\circ \\phi$ is a composition of two continuous maps, and is itself continuous.\n\nSince $K(z, t) = H(g(z), t)$ is a continuous map satisfying the boundary conditions for a homotopy between $h_0$ and $h_1$, it is the desired construction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{H(g(z), t)}$$", "id": "1557543"}, {"introduction": "In topology, properties that hold on small, overlapping pieces of a space do not always generalize to the space as a whole.
