Let a topological space $X$ be the union of two open, path-connected subsets $U$ and $V$. Suppose their intersection $U \\cap V$ is non-empty and path-connected, and let $p \\in U \\cap V$ be the basepoint. The theorem states that $\\pi_1(X, p)$ is the free product of $\\pi_1(U, p)$ and $\\pi_1(V, p)$ with amalgamation over $\\pi_1(U \\cap V, p)$. A crucial special case arises when the intersection is simply connected, i.e., $\\pi_1(U \\cap V, p)$ is the trivial group $\\{e\\}$. In this case, the fundamental group of $X$ is the free product of the fundamental groups of $U$ and $V$:\n$$ \\pi_1(X, p) \\cong \\pi_1(U, p) * \\pi_1(V, p) $$\nOur goal is to find a decomposition that results in $\\pi_1(X, p) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z}$. This means we need to find open, path-connected sets $U$ and $V$ such that $\\pi_1(U, p) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, $\\pi_1(V, p) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and $\\pi_1(U \\cap V, p)$ is trivial.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A.** In this option, $U$ is an open set containing the first circle $C_1$ and deformation retracts onto it. Since the fundamental group is invariant under deformation retraction, $\\pi_1(U, p) \\cong \\pi_1(C_1, p) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Similarly, $V$ is an open set containing the second circle $C_2$ and deformation retracts onto it, so $\\pi_1(V, p) \\cong \\pi_1(C_2, p) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The sets $U$ and $V$ are open and path-connected. The intersection $U \\cap V$ is stated to be a path-connected and contractible open set containing $p$. A contractible space has a trivial fundamental group, so $\\pi_1(U \\cap V, p) \\cong \\{e\\}$. All conditions for the simplified version of the Seifert-van Kampen theorem are met. Applying the theorem gives:\n$$ \\pi_1(X, p) \\cong \\pi_1(U, p) * \\pi_1(V, p) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z} $$\nThis matches the desired result. Therefore, this decomposition is valid.\n\n**B.** In this option, $U = C_1$ and $V = C_2$. While their union is $X$, the sets $C_1$ and $C_2$ are not open subsets of $X$ (in its standard topology as a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, for instance). The Seifert-van Kampen theorem explicitly requires that the subsets $U$ and $V$ must be open in $X$. Since this fundamental condition is not met, this decomposition is invalid.\n\n**C.** Here, $U = X \\setminus \\{a\\}$ and $V$ is a small open neighborhood of $a$. The sets are open, and their union is $X$. Let's assume $V$ is chosen to be path-connected and simply connected (like an open disk). Since $p \\notin V$, we cannot directly use $p$ as a basepoint for $V$, and more importantly, the intersection $U \\cap V = V \\setminus \\{a\\}$, a punctured disk, does not contain the basepoint $p$. The Seifert-van Kampen theorem requires the basepoint to be in the intersection $U \\cap V$. Even if we re-base our groups, let's analyze the groups. $U=X \\setminus \\{a\\}$ deformation retracts onto the second circle $C_2$. Thus, $\\pi_1(U,p) \\cong \\pi_1(C_2,p) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The set $V$ is a simply connected open neighborhood of $a$, so $\\pi_1(V, a)$ is trivial. Their intersection is $V \\setminus \\{a\\}$, which has fundamental group $\\mathbb{Z}$. The theorem involves amalgamation, $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(U) *_{\\pi_1(U \\cap V)} \\pi_1(V)$. This would be $\\mathbb{Z} *_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\{e\\}$, which collapses to the trivial group, not $\\mathbb{Z}*\\mathbb{Z}$. This decomposition does not give the correct result.\n\n**D.** In this option, $U$ and $V$ are open and path-connected. However, their intersection $U \\cap V$ is described as consisting of two disjoint open sets. The standard version of the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, particularly the one leading to a simple free product, requires the intersection $U \\cap V$ to be path-connected. Since this condition is violated, the theorem cannot be applied in its standard form to reach the conclusion $\\pi_1(X, p) \\cong \\pi_1(U,p) * \\pi_1(V,p)$. Thus, this decomposition is not suitable.\n\nBased on the analysis, only option A describes a decomposition that correctly satisfies all the hypotheses of the Seifert-van Kampen theorem to produce the result $\\pi_1(X, p) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1586615"}, {"introduction": "Now we move from setup to a classic, non-trivial calculation that demonstrates the theorem's true power.
