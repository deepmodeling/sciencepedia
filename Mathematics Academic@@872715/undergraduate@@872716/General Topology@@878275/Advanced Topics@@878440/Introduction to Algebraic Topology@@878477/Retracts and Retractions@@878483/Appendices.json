A subset $A \\subseteq X$ is a retract if there exists a continuous map $r: X \\to A$ with $r(a) = a$ for all $a \\in A$.\n\nFirst, we note a fundamental topological fact: if the domain is discrete, then every function from it is continuous. Explicitly, for any function $f: X \\to Y$ and any open set $U \\subseteq Y$, the preimage $f^{-1}(U) \\subseteq X$ is some subset of $X$, and since every subset of $X$ is open, $f$ is continuous. Therefore, any function $r: X \\to A$ is continuous.\n\nNecessity: If $A$ is a retract of $X$, then there exists a function $r: X \\to A$. Since $X$ is nonempty (it has infinitely many elements), the existence of any function $X \\to A$ requires that $A$ be nonempty. In particular, there is no function from a nonempty set to the empty set, so $A \\neq \\varnothing$ is necessary.\n\nSufficiency: Let $A \\subseteq X$ be nonempty. Choose a point $a_{0} \\in A$ and define a function $r: X \\to A$ by\n$$\nr(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\nx, & \\text{if } x \\in A,\\\\\na_{0}, & \\text{if } x \\in X \\setminus A.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis $r$ is a well-defined function $X \\to A$, and as established, it is continuous because the domain $X$ is discrete.

Therefore, no retraction from a non-empty $X$ onto $\\varnothing$ can exist. Hence, $\\varnothing$ is not a retract of a non-empty $X$.\n\nStep 2: Exhibit two disjoint retracts of $X = \\mathbb{R}$, whose intersection is empty.\n- Define $A = [-1,0] \\subset \\mathbb{R}$.

Given retractions $r_{A}: X \\to A$ and $r_{B}: X \\to B$, the composition $r_{A} \\circ r_{B}$ maps $X$ into $A$ (not necessarily into $A \\cap B$), so it does not in general yield a retraction onto $A \\cap B$.\n- B: False. The counterexample in Step 2 uses $X = \\mathbb{R}$, which is Hausdorff.\n- C: False. In $X = \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, while the $x$-axis is a retract (orthogonal projection), the unit circle $S^{1}$ is not a retract of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. If $r: \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to S^{1}$ were a retraction, then restricting $r$ to the closed unit disk $D^{2} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ would give a retraction $D^{2} \\to S^{1}$, contradicting the no-retraction theorem (e.g., via fundamental groups: a retraction would induce an injective homomorphism $\\pi_{1}(S^{1}) \\to \\pi_{1}(D^{2})$, but $\\pi_{1}(D^{2})$ is trivial while $\\pi_{1}(S^{1}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ is not).\n- D: True.
