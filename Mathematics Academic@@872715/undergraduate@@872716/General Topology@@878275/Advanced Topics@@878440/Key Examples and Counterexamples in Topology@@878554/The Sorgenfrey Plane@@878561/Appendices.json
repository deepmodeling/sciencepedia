A sequence $\\{p_n\\}$ converges to a point $P$ if and only if for every open set $U$ containing $P$, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that for all $n  N$, the point $p_n$ is in $U$.\n\nThe topology of the Sorgenfrey plane is generated by the basis of sets of the form $[a, b) \\times [c, d)$. To check for convergence to a point $P$, it is sufficient to check this condition for all basis elements containing $P$.\n\nLet's test the candidate point $P = (0,0)$. We need to determine if the sequence converges to $(0,0)$.\nLet $B$ be an arbitrary basis element containing the point $(0,0)$.

For the sequence to converge to $Q$, all but a finite number of its terms must lie in $B_1$. A point $p_n$ is in $B_1$ if its first coordinate, $\\frac{1}{n}$, is in $[x, x+1)$. This requires $\\frac{1}{n} \\ge x$, or $n \\le \\frac{1}{x}$. Since $x0$, $\\frac{1}{x}$ is a finite positive number.

Let's consider the basis element $B_2 = [x, 0) \\times \\mathbb{R}$, which is an open set containing $Q$. The first coordinate of any point in our sequence is $\\frac{1}{n}$, which is always positive. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{n} \\notin [x, 0)$ for any $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$. This means *no* term of the sequence lies in the open set $B_2$. Thus, the sequence cannot converge to $Q$.

Consider $S=[0,1]\\times[0,1]$ with the subspace topology and the subset\n$$\nL=\\{(x,y)\\in S: x+y=1\\}.\n$$\nFirst, we show $L$ is closed in $S$ by showing its complement, $S \\setminus L$, is open in $S$. Let $(u,v) \\in S \\setminus L$. This means $(u,v) \\in [0,1]\\times[0,1]$ and $u+v \\neq 1$.\nIf $u+v > 1$, consider the neighborhood $N = ([u, u+1) \\times [v, v+1)) \\cap S$.
