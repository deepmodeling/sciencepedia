The vector space operations are the standard pointwise addition of functions, $(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$, and scalar multiplication, $(c \\cdot f)(x) = c \\cdot f(x)$ for any scalar $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe support of a function $f \\in C(\\mathbb{R})$, denoted by $\\text{supp}(f)$, is defined as the closure of the set of points where the function is non-zero.

The zero vector in the space $C(\\mathbb{R})$ is the zero function, $z(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. To determine if $z(x)$ is in $C_c(\\mathbb{R})$, we must find its support. The set of points where $z(x)$ is non-zero is the empty set, $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid z(x) \\neq 0\\} = \\emptyset$. The support is the closure of this set, $\\text{supp}(z) = \\overline{\\emptyset} = \\emptyset$. The empty set is a compact set in $\\mathbb{R}$ because it is both closed and bounded (vacuously). Since the support of the zero function is compact, the zero function $z(x)$ is in $C_c(\\mathbb{R})$. Therefore, statement A is incorrect.\n\nNext, let's check for closure under addition. Let $f$ and $g$ be two arbitrary functions in $C_c(\\mathbb{R})$. This means that their supports, $\\text{supp}(f)$ and $\\text{supp}(g)$, are compact sets. Let $h = f+g$. We need to determine if the support of $h$ is compact.\nA point $x$ can be in the set $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid h(x) \\neq 0\\}$ only if at least one of $f(x)$ or $g(x)$ is non-zero. If both $f(x)=0$ and $g(x)=0$, then $(f+g)(x)=0$. This gives the inclusion:\n$$ \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid (f+g)(x) \\neq 0\\} \\subseteq \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid f(x) \\neq 0\\} \\cup \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid g(x) \\neq 0\\} $$\nTaking the closure of both sides and using the property that $\\overline{A \\cup B} = \\overline{A} \\cup \\overline{B}$, we get:\n$$ \\text{supp}(f+g) = \\overline{\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid (f+g)(x) \\neq 0\\}} \\subseteq \\overline{\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid f(x) \\neq 0\\} \\cup \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid g(x) \\neq 0\\}} $$\n$$ \\text{supp}(f+g) \\subseteq \\overline{\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid f(x) \\neq 0\\}} \\cup \\overline{\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid g(x) \\neq 0\\}} $$\n$$ \\text{supp}(f+g) \\subseteq \\text{supp}(f) \\cup \\text{supp}(g) $$\nBy assumption, $\\text{supp}(f)$ and $\\text{supp}(g)$ are compact sets. The finite union of compact sets is also a compact set. Thus, $\\text{supp}(f) \\cup \\text{supp}(g)$ is compact. The support of a function, being a closure, is always a closed set. Since $\\text{supp}(f+g)$ is a closed subset of the compact set $\\text{supp}(f) \\cup \\text{supp}(g)$, it must also be compact. Therefore, $f+g \\in C_c(\\mathbb{R})$, and $C_c(\\mathbb{R})$ is closed under addition. This shows that statement B is incorrect.\n\nFinally, let's check for closure under scalar multiplication. Let $f \\in C_c(\\mathbb{R})$ and let $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be a scalar.\nCase 1: $c=0$. Then $c \\cdot f$ is the zero function, $z(x)=0$. As we showed earlier, the zero function is in $C_c(\\mathbb{R})$.\nCase 2: $c \\neq 0$. The product $(c \\cdot f)(x) = c \\cdot f(x)$ is non-zero if and only if $f(x)$ is non-zero. Thus, the set of points where $c \\cdot f$ is non-zero is identical to the set where $f$ is non-zero:\n$$ \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid (c \\cdot f)(x) \\neq 0\\} = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid f(x) \\neq 0\\} $$\nTaking the closure of both sides, we find that the supports are equal:\n$$ \\text{supp}(c \\cdot f) = \\text{supp}(f) $$\nSince $f \\in C_c(\\mathbb{R})$, its support is compact. Therefore, $\\text{supp}(c \\cdot f)$ is also compact, which means $c \\cdot f \\in C_c(\\mathbb{R})$.\nCombining both cases, we see that $C_c(\\mathbb{R})$ is closed under scalar multiplication. Thus, statement C is incorrect.\n\nSince $C_c(\\mathbb{R})$ contains the zero vector and is closed under both addition and scalar multiplication, it satisfies all the requirements to be a vector subspace of $C(\\mathbb{R})$.
