We first show $S(x)$ is well-defined, continuous, and strictly positive. By local finiteness of $\\{\\phi_{\\alpha}\\}$, for each $x \\in X$ there exists an open neighborhood $V_{x}$ on which only finitely many $\\phi_{\\gamma}$ are nonzero. Therefore, on $V_{x}$, $S$ is a finite sum of continuous functions, hence continuous. Moreover, for each $x \\in X$, since $\\sum_{\\alpha \\in A}\\phi_{\\alpha}(x)=1$ and each $\\phi_{\\alpha}(x)\\geq 0$, there exists at least one index $\\alpha$ with $\\phi_{\\alpha}(x)>0$. Hence $S(x)\\geq \\phi_{\\alpha}(x)^{2}>0$, so $S(x)>0$ for all $x \\in X$.\n\nSince each $\\phi_{\\alpha}$ is continuous and $S$ is continuous and never zero, each $\\psi_{\\alpha}$ is continuous as a quotient of continuous functions with nonvanishing denominator.\n\nNext, we verify the partition of unity property. For any $x \\in X$, by local finiteness, only finitely many $\\phi_{\\alpha}(x)$ are nonzero, hence only finitely many $\\psi_{\\alpha}(x)$ are nonzero.

Moreover, the family is locally finite: for each $x$, on the neighborhood $V_{x}$ where only finitely many $\\phi_{\\alpha}$ are nonzero, precisely those same indices can give nonzero $\\psi_{\\alpha}$. In fact, for every $x \\in X$,\n$$\n\\psi_{\\alpha}(x)=0 \\iff \\phi_{\\alpha}(x)=0,\n$$\nsince $S(x)>0$. Therefore the sets of indices with nonzero values at $x$ are identical for $\\{\\phi_{\\alpha}\\}$ and $\\{\\psi_{\\alpha}\\}$, and the local finiteness property is preserved.\n\nFinally, we check subordination. Because $\\psi_{\\alpha}(x)=0$ if and only if $\\phi_{\\alpha}(x)=0$, the sets $\\{x \\in X \\mid \\psi_{\\alpha}(x)\\neq 0\\}$ and $\\{x \\in X \\mid \\phi_{\\alpha}(x)\\neq 0\\}$ coincide, and hence their closures (supports) coincide:\n$$\n\\operatorname{supp}(\\psi_{\\alpha})=\\operatorname{supp}(\\phi_{\\alpha}).\n$$\nSince each $\\operatorname{supp}(\\phi_{\\alpha})$ is contained in some $U_{\\beta}$ by the given subordination, the same is true for $\\operatorname{supp}(\\psi_{\\alpha})$.

Hence the correct option is C, and all other options fail respectively because the sum does equal $1$ (A is false), the denominator never vanishes so continuity is preserved (B is false), local finiteness is preserved (D is false), and subordination is preserved (E is false).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1552875"}, {"introduction": "While abstract existence theorems are powerful, seeing a concrete construction can provide deeper insight.
