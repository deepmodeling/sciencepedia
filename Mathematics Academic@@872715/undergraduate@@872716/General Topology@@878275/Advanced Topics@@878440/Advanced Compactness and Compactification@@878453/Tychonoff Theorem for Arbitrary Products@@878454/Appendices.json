Since no $X_{i}$ has singletons as open sets, we cannot choose $U_{i}=\\{x_{i}\\}$; moreover, because only finitely many coordinates can be restricted, any basic neighborhood contains points differing from $x$ in some unrestricted coordinate. Thus no singleton $\\{x\\}$ is open in $X$, so $X$ is not discrete. Therefore C is false.\n\nD. $X$ is path-connected.\nLet $p:[0,1]\\to X$ be a continuous path.

The sets $\\{F_{n}\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ are pairwise disjoint and cover $[0,1]$.\n\nWe claim $p_{j}$ must be constant.

If $p_{j}$ were non-constant, then all $F_{n}$ would be proper, hence each $F_{n}$ would be closed with empty interior (nowhere dense). But by the Baire category theorem, a complete metric space like $[0,1]$ cannot be the countable union of nowhere dense closed sets. Hence a contradiction. Therefore one fiber must be all of $[0,1]$, i.e., $p_{j}$ is constant.\n\nSince this holds for every $j\\in I$, the path $p$ is constant in every coordinate, hence constant in $X$.
