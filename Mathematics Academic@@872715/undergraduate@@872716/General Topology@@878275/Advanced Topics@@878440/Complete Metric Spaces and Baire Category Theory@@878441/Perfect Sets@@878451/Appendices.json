In $\\mathbb{R}$ with metric $d(x,y)=|x-y|$, we use the following facts: closed intervals are closed; an open interval is not closed; the set $\\mathbb{Q}$ is dense but not closed; and a point $p$ is isolated in a set $S$ if there exists $r>0$ such that $B(p,r)\\cap S=\\{p\\}$.\n\nFor $S_{1}=[0,1]\\cup[2,3]$: Each component $[0,1]$ and $[2,3]$ is closed, hence their finite union is closed. For any $p\\in[0,1]$, every open ball $B(p,r)$ intersects $[0,1]$ in points other than $p$, including at the endpoints $0$ and $1$ because for any $r>0$ there exist points in $(0,r)$ or $(1-r,1)$, respectively. The same holds for any $p\\in[2,3]$. Therefore every point of $S_{1}$ is a limit point of $S_{1}$ and $S_{1}$ has no isolated points. Hence $S_{1}$ is perfect.\n\nFor $S_{2}=\\mathbb{Q}\\cap\\left([0,1]\\cup[2,3]\\right)$: Although every rational in these intervals is a limit point of $S_{2}$ because $\\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, the set is not closed, since its closure is $[0,1]\\cup[2,3]$, which strictly contains $S_{2}$. Therefore $S_{2}$ is not perfect.\n\nFor $S_{3}=\\{0\\}\\cup\\{1/n\\mid n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}\\}$: The set is closed because its only limit point is $0$, which it contains. However, points $1/n$ are isolated: for each $n$, choose $r>0$ smaller than half the distance from $1/n$ to the nearest distinct point of $S_{3}$; then $B(1/n,r)\\cap S_{3}=\\{1/n\\}$. Hence not every point is a limit point, so $S_{3}$ is not perfect.\n\nFor $S_{4}=(-1,1)$: Every point is a limit point within the open interval, but $S_{4}$ is not closed in $\\mathbb{R}$ because its closure is $[-1,1]$. Therefore $S_{4}$ is not perfect.\n\nFor $S_{5}=\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}[2n,2n+1]$: The complement is $(-\\infty,2)\\cup(3,4)\\cup(5,6)\\cup\\cdots$, which is a union of open intervals and thus open. Therefore $S_{5}$ is closed.
