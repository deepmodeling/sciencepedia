The principle of weak induction, starting at $n_0$, is a theorem that states: for any predicate $P(n)$, if a base case $P(n_0)$ holds, and if for any $k \\ge n_0$, the truth of $P(k)$ implies the truth of $P(k+1)$, then $P(n)$ must be true for all $n \\ge n_0$.\n\nLet's prove this theorem using WOP.\nLet $P$ be a predicate defined on the set $\\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid n \\ge n_0\\}$.\nAssume the following two premises are true:\n1. (Base Case) $P(n_0)$ is true.\n2. (Inductive Step) For all integers $k$ such that $k \\ge n_0$, the implication $P(k) \\Rightarrow P(k+1)$ is true.\n\nWe want to prove the conclusion: For all integers $n$ such that $n \\ge n_0$, $P(n)$ is true.\n\nWe will use a proof by contradiction. Assume the conclusion is false. This means that the set of counterexamples, $S$, is non-empty. Let us define this set:\n$$S = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid n \\ge n_0 \\text{ and } \\neg P(n)\\}$$\nBy our assumption, $S \\ne \\emptyset$. The set $S$ is a subset of $\\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid n \\ge n_0\\}$.\nAccording to the Well-Ordering Principle, since $S$ is a non-empty subset of $\\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid n \\ge n_0\\}$, it must contain a least element. Let us call this least element $m$.\n\nThe properties of $m$ are:\n- $m \\in S$, which means $m \\ge n_0$ and $\\neg P(m)$ is true.\n- For any $j \\in S$, $m \\le j$. This is equivalent to stating that for any integer $j$ such that $n_0 \\le j  m$, it must be that $j \\notin S$. By the definition of $S$, this implies that $P(j)$ is true for all $j$ in the range $n_0 \\le j  m$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the value of $m$.\nCase 1: $m = n_0$.\nIf $m = n_0$, then from the property $m \\in S$, we have $\\neg P(n_0)$. However, this directly contradicts Premise 1, which states that $P(n_0)$ is true. Thus, $m$ cannot be equal to $n_0$.\n\nCase 2: $m  n_0$.\nSince $m$ and $n_0$ are integers, $m  n_0$ implies $m \\ge n_0+1$. This means that $m-1$ is an integer satisfying $n_0 \\le m-1  m$.\nBecause $m$ is the least element of $S$, and $m-1  m$, it follows that $m-1 \\notin S$.\nBy the definition of $S$, this means that $P(m-1)$ must be true.\n\nNow, we use Premise 2, which states that $\\forall k \\ge n_0, P(k) \\Rightarrow P(k+1)$.\nSince $m-1 \\ge n_0$, we can set $k = m-1$. The premise must hold for this value of $k$. Therefore, the implication $P(m-1) \\Rightarrow P((m-1)+1)$, which simplifies to $P(m-1) \\Rightarrow P(m)$, must be true.\n\nAt this point, we have established two facts:\n1. $P(m-1)$ is true.\n2. The implication $P(m-1) \\Rightarrow P(m)$ is true.\n\nFrom these two facts, by the rule of modus ponens, we must conclude that $P(m)$ is true.\nHowever, we know that $m$ is an element of $S$, which by definition means that $\\neg P(m)$ is true.\nWe have derived a contradiction: $P(m) \\land \\neg P(m)$.\n\nOur initial assumption—that the conclusion \"$\\forall n \\ge n_0, P(n)$\" is false—must be incorrect. Therefore, the conclusion must be true.\nThis completes the proof. The structure of the principle we have just validated is:\nIf ($P(n_0)$ is true) and ($\\forall k \\ge n_0, P(k) \\Rightarrow P(k+1)$ is true), then ($\\forall n \\ge n_0, P(n)$ is true).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options.\n\nA. For all predicates $P$ and all $n_0\\in\\mathbb{N}$, if $P(n_0)$ and $\\forall k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ with $k\\ge n_0$, $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+1)$, then $\\forall n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ with $n\\ge n_0$, $P(n)$.\nThis option perfectly matches the structure of the principle of weak induction that we derived from the Well-Ordering Principle. It has the correct base case ($P(n_0)$), the correct single-step inductive implication ($\\forall k \\ge n_0, P(k) \\Rightarrow P(k+1)$), and the correct conclusion ($\\forall n \\ge n_0, P(n)$).\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. For all predicates $P$ and all $n_0\\in\\mathbb{N}$, if $P(n_0)$ and $\\forall k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ with $kn_0$, $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+1)$, then $\\forall n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ with $n\\ge n_0$, $P(n)$.\nThis is incorrect. The inductive step only starts for $k=n_0+1$. There is no guarantee that the property propagates from $n_0$ to $n_0+1$. For a counterexample, let $n_0=1$ and $P(n)$ be the predicate \"$n \\neq 2$\". $P(1)$ is true. For all $k1$, if $P(k)$ is true then $k\\neq 2$, so $k2$. Then $k+13$, so $k+1 \\neq 2$, and $P(k+1)$ is true. So the premise $\\forall k1, P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+1)$ holds. However, the conclusion $\\forall n\\ge 1, P(n)$ is false, because $P(2)$ is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. For all predicates $P$ and all $n_0\\in\\mathbb{N}$, if $P(n_0)$ and $\\exists k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ with $k\\ge n_0$ such that $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+1)$, then $\\forall n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ with $n\\ge n_0$, $P(n)$.\nThis is incorrect. The use of an existential quantifier $\\exists$ instead of a universal quantifier $\\forall$ is a fatal flaw. The inductive step must hold for all $k$ to build the chain of implications. For a counterexample, let $n_0=1$ and $P(n)$ be \"$n=1$\". Then $P(1)$ is true. For $k=2$, $P(2)$ is false, so $P(2) \\Rightarrow P(3)$ is a true implication. Thus the premise $\\exists k \\ge 1, P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+1)$ holds. But the conclusion $\\forall n \\ge 1, P(n)$ is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. For all predicates $P$ and all $n_0\\in\\mathbb{N}$, if $P(n_0)$ and $\\forall k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ with $k\\ge n_0$, $P(k+1)\\Rightarrow P(k)$, then $\\forall n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ with $n\\ge n_0$, $P(n)$.\nThis is incorrect. The implication is reversed. This structure is related to downward induction, but as stated, it cannot prove a property for all $n \\ge n_0$. From $P(n_0)$, one cannot deduce anything about $P(n_0+1)$. The implication $P(n_0+1)\\Rightarrow P(n_0)$ does not force $P(n_0+1)$ to be true. For a counterexample, let $n_0=1$ and $P(n)$ be \"$n=1$\". $P(1)$ is true. For any $k\\ge 1$, $P(k+1)$ is false, so the implication $P(k+1)\\Rightarrow P(k)$ is vacuously true. The premises hold, but the conclusion $\\forall n \\ge 1, P(n)$ is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. For all predicates $P$ and all $n_0\\in\\mathbb{N}$, if $P(n_0)$ and $\\forall k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ with $k\\ge n_0$, $P(k)\\lor P(k+1)$, then $\\forall n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ with $n\\ge n_0$, $P(n)$.\nThis is incorrect. The logical connective is a disjunction ($\\lor$) instead of an implication ($\\Rightarrow$). This is too weak. For a counterexample, let $n_0=1$ and let $P(n)$ be \"$n$ is odd\". Then $P(1)$ is true. For any $k\\ge 1$, one of $k$ or $k+1$ is odd, so $P(k)\\lor P(k+1)$ is always true. But the conclusion, that all natural numbers are odd, is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nF. For all predicates $P$ and all $n_0\\in\\mathbb{N}$, if $P(n_0)$ and $\\forall k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ with $k\\ge n_0$, $\\big(\\forall j\\in\\mathbb{N}\\text{ with }n_0\\le j\\le k,\\;P(j)\\big)\\Rightarrow P(k+1)$, then $\\forall n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ with $n\\ge n_0$, $P(n)$.\nThis option describes the principle of strong (or complete) induction. While this is a valid mathematical principle and is equivalent to weak induction and WOP, it is not the principle of *weak* induction. The problem explicitly requests the formalization of weak induction with a \"single-step inductive implication\". The inductive step in weak induction is $P(k) \\Rightarrow P(k+1)$, which depends only on the predecessor. The inductive step here is $(\\forall j \\in \\{n_0, \\dots, k\\}, P(j)) \\Rightarrow P(k+1)$, which depends on all predecessors back to $n_0$. Therefore, this is not the correct answer to the specific question asked.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the derivation and analysis, only option A provides the correct and complete formalization of the weak induction principle as requested.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3086080"}, {"introduction": "With the formal structure of induction established, we now explore why every component is essential.

Thus $P(n)\\Rightarrow P(n+1)$ holds for all $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$. Nevertheless, one cannot conclude $P(n)$ for all $n$ by weak induction because the theorem requires the base step $P(1)$ to be true. From the Well-Ordering Principle perspective, the set $C=\\{n\\in\\mathbb{N}: \\neg P(n)\\}$ equals $\\{1\\}$, which is nonempty with least element $1$, so there is a minimal counterexample; hence we cannot deduce that $C$ is empty, and therefore we cannot conclude $P(n)$ holds for all $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$.\n\nB. Define $P(n)$ to be the statement \"$n$ is composite\". Then $P(1)$ fails since $1$ is not composite. The inductive step $P(n)\\Rightarrow P(n+1)$ holds because if $n$ is composite then $n+1$ is also composite. Therefore the inductive step holds for all $n$, and the failure of $P(1)$ alone shows only that $P(1)$ is an exception; by the Well-Ordering Principle, we can still rule out any least counterexample larger than $1$, so we conclude $P(n)$ for all $n\\ge 2$.\n\nC.

It is a standard and well-posed question examining a foundational concept in mathematical proofs. I will now proceed to analyze the options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to understand why a proof by induction requires a true base case. An inductive proof, structured as $[P(1) \\land (\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}, P(n) \\Rightarrow P(n+1))] \\Rightarrow (\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}, P(n))$, is a valid logical argument. If the premise (the part in the square brackets) is true, the conclusion must be true. The task is to find an example where the premise is false because $P(1)$ is false, and to explain why this invalidates the conclusion, using both the language of induction and the equivalent WOP.\n\nThe WOP argument for proving $\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}, P(n)$ runs by contradiction:\n1. Assume the set of counterexamples, $C = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid \\neg P(n)\\}$, is non-empty.\n2. By WOP, $C$ must have a least element, $m$.\n3. The base case of induction, $P(1)$, ensures that $1 \\notin C$, so $m  1$.\n4. Since $m$ is the least counterexample, $m-1$ is not a counterexample, meaning $P(m-1)$ is true.\n5. The inductive step, $P(n) \\Rightarrow P(n+1)$, applied at $n=m-1$, gives $P(m-1) \\Rightarrow P(m)$.\n6. Since $P(m-1)$ is true, we conclude $P(m)$ must be true. This means $m \\notin C$, which contradicts our assumption that $m$ is an element of $C$.\n7. The contradiction proves that the initial assumption must be false; thus, $C$ is empty.\n\nIf the base case $P(1)$ fails, then $1 \\in C$. This means $C$ is non-empty, and its least element is $1$. The WOP argument cannot proceed past step $3$, because we cannot establish $m1$. WOP thus confirms the existence of a counterexample (namely, $1$) instead of proving its non-existence. The correct option must reflect this specific line of reasoning.\n\n#### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Define $P(n)$ to be the statement \"$n\\ge 2$\".**\n\n- **Property Construction:**\n    - Base Case $P(1)$: The statement is \"$1 \\ge 2$\", which is false. This fulfills the first condition.\n    - Inductive Step $P(n) \\Rightarrow P(n+1)$: We must verify if \"if $n \\ge 2$, then $n+1 \\ge 2$\" is a true implication for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n        - For $n=1$, the premise $P(1)$ is \"$1 \\ge 2$\", which is false. The implication $P(1) \\Rightarrow P(2)$ is therefore vacuously true.\n        - For any $n  1$, if we assume $P(n)$ is true (i.e., $n \\ge 2$), then it follows that $n+1 \\ge 2+1 = 3$. Since $3  2$, $n+1 \\ge 2$ is true. So $P(n+1)$ is true. The implication is true.\n    - The inductive step $P(n) \\Rightarrow P(n+1)$ holds for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The property is constructed correctly.\n\n- **Explanation:**\n    - The explanation correctly states that one cannot conclude $P(n)$ for all $n$ because weak induction requires the base case $P(1)$ to be true. This is accurate.\n    - It then considers the WOP perspective. The set of counterexamples is $C = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid \\neg P(n)\\} = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid n \\not\\ge 2\\} = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid n  2\\}$. Since $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, this set is precisely $\\{1\\}$.\n    - The option correctly identifies that this set is non-empty and has a least element of $1$. This establishes that there is a minimal counterexample. Therefore, the set of counterexamples $C$ cannot be proven empty, and the universal statement $\\forall n, P(n)$ is false. The explanation is coherent and correct.\n\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Define $P(n)$ to be the statement \"$n$ is composite\".**\n\n- **Property Construction:**\n    - Base Case $P(1)$: The statement is \"$1$ is composite\". This is false, as $1$ is a unit. This part is correct.\n    - Inductive Step $P(n) \\Rightarrow P(n+1)$: The option claims \"if $n$ is composite then $n+1$ is also composite.\" This is demonstrably false. For $n=4$, $P(4)$ is true because $4$ is composite. However, $n+1 = 5$, which is prime. So $P(5)$ is false. The implication $P(4) \\Rightarrow P(5)$ is false. The inductive step does not hold for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n- **Explanation:** The explanation is based on the false premise that the inductive step holds. All subsequent reasoning is unsound. For example, it falsely concludes $P(n)$ holds for all $n \\ge 2$.\n\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Define $P(n)$ to be the statement \"$n\\neq n$\".**\n\n- **Property Construction:**\n    - Base Case $P(1)$: The statement is \"$1 \\neq 1$\", which is false. This fulfills the first condition.\n    - Inductive Step $P(n) \\Rightarrow P(n+1)$: The statement $P(n)$ (\"$n \\neq n$\") is false for every $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. An implication with a false premise is always true (vacuously true). Thus, $P(n) \\Rightarrow P(n+1)$ holds for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The property is constructed correctly.\n\n- **Explanation:** The option claims: \"Therefore, because the inductive step holds for all $n$, the Weak Principle of Mathematical Induction applies and yields $P(n)$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\" This is a critical misunderstanding of the principle of induction. The principle requires *both* the base case and the inductive step to be true. Since the base case $P(1)$ is false, the hypothesis of the induction theorem is false, and one cannot make any conclusion about the truth of $\\forall n, P(n)$. Claiming that induction *proves* the statement is the exact opposite of what is happening.\n\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Define $P(n)$ to be the statement \"$n\\ge 100$\".**\n\n- **Property Construction:**\n    - Base Case $P(1)$: The statement is \"$1 \\ge 100$\", which is false. This is correct.\n    - Inductive Step $P(n) \\Rightarrow P(n+1)$: This is analogous to option A. For any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, if $n99$, the implication is vacuously true. If $n=99$, the implication $P(99) \\Rightarrow P(100)$ is also vacuously true. If $n \\ge 100$, then $n+1  n \\ge 100$, so the implication is true. The inductive step holds for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The property is constructed correctly.\n\n- **Explanation:** The explanation contains several falsehoods.\n    - \"strong induction does not require a base case when the inductive step is universally quantified\". This is fundamentally incorrect. All forms of mathematical induction on $\\mathbb{N}$ require a base case to be established. Without it, the \"domino chain\" never starts.\n    - \"one may still conclude $P(n)$ holds for all $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ by appealing to the Well-Ordering Principle to eliminate all counterexamples at once.\" This misrepresents the role of WOP. The set of counterexamples is $C = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid n  100\\} = \\{1, 2, \\dots, 99\\}$. This set is non-empty. WOP guarantees it has a least element, which is $1$. So WOP confirms that counterexamples exist; it does not eliminate them.\n\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\nOnly option A correctly constructs a property that satisfies the given conditions ($P(1)$ is false, but the inductive step holds for all $n$) and provides a logically sound explanation, grounded in both the principle of induction and the well-ordering principle, for why the proof fails.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3086076"}, {"introduction": "Mathematical induction is more than a single formula; it is a flexible proof strategy.

Prove the base cases $P(n_0)$ and $P(n_0+3)$, and then apply the step $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+2)$ for all $k\\ge n_0$.", "solution": "The problem statement is first validated to ensure it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- $n_0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is a fixed integer.\n- $P(n)$ is a statement about integers $n$ for $n \\ge n_0$.\n- The established induction step is: for every integer $k \\ge n_0$, if $P(k)$ holds, then $P(k+2)$ holds. This can be written symbolically as $\\forall k \\ge n_0, [P(k) \\implies P(k+2)]$.\n- The goal is to prove that $P(n)$ is true for all integers $n \\ge n_0$.\n- We are permitted to use the Principle of Mathematical Induction (PMI) and the Well-Ordering Principle (WOP). WOP states that every nonempty subset of the natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}=\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$ has a least element. This principle can be extended to any non-empty set of integers that is bounded below, such as $\\{n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid n \\ge n_0\\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is a standard exercise in mathematical logic, specifically concerning proof by induction.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based entirely on the established mathematical principles of induction and well-ordering. It is free of any scientific or factual unsoundness.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly stated. It asks for the necessary set of base cases to complete a proof, given a specific inductive step. A unique and logical solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and unambiguous. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\nAll criteria for a valid problem are met. The problem is not flawed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. Proceeding to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Required Base Cases\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the structure of the provided inductive step: $P(k) \\implies P(k+2)$. This step allows us to advance the proof by an increment of $2$, not by the standard increment of $1$.\n\nThis has a crucial consequence: the truth of $P(k)$ only implies the truth of $P(n)$ for integers $n$ that have the same parity as $k$ and are greater than or equal to $k$. For instance, if $k$ is an even number, $k+2$, $k+4$, $k+6$, and so on are all even. If $k$ is an odd number, $k+2$, $k+4$, $k+6$, and so on are all odd. The inductive step never bridges the gap between even and odd integers (or more generally, between integers of the form $n_0 + 2m$ and $n_0 + 1 + 2m$ for $m \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$).\n\nTo prove that $P(n)$ holds for *all* integers $n \\ge n_0$, we must cover all integers in this range. The set of integers $\\{n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid n \\ge n_0\\}$ can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets based on their parity relative to $n_0$:\n1. The set $S_{even} = \\{n \\mid n \\ge n_0 \\text{ and } n \\equiv n_0 \\pmod 2\\} = \\{n_0, n_0+2, n_0+4, \\dots \\}$.\n2. The set $S_{odd} = \\{n \\mid n \\ge n_0 \\text{ and } n \\equiv n_0+1 \\pmod 2\\} = \\{n_0+1, n_0+3, n_0+5, \\dots \\}$.\n\nTo prove the statement for all elements in $S_{even}$, we need to establish a base case that \"starts\" this chain of implications. The first element of this set is $n_0$. By proving $P(n_0)$, the inductive step $P(k) \\implies P(k+2)$ ensures that $P(n_0+2)$, $P(n_0+4)$, etc., are all true. Thus, we must prove the base case $P(n_0)$.\n\nSimilarly, to prove the statement for all elements in $S_{odd}$, we need to establish a base case for this second chain. The first element of this set is $n_0+1$. By proving $P(n_0+1)$, the inductive step ensures that $P(n_0+3)$, $P(n_0+5)$, etc., are all true. Thus, we must prove the base case $P(n_0+1)$.\n\nBy proving both $P(n_0)$ and $P(n_0+1)$, we initiate two separate inductive arguments that, combined, cover all integers $n \\ge n_0$.\n\nLet's formalize this using the Well-Ordering Principle. Let $S = \\{ n \\ge n_0 \\mid P(n) \\text{ is false} \\}$. We assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $S$ is non-empty. By the WOP, $S$ has a least element, let's call it $m$. Now, consider the base cases $P(n_0)$ and $P(n_0+1)$ to be proven true.\n- Since $P(n_0)$ is true, $m \\ne n_0$.\n- Since $P(n_0+1)$ is true, $m \\ne n_0+1$.\n- Therefore, we must have $m \\ge n_0+2$.\n- Now consider the integer $k = m-2$. Since $m \\ge n_0+2$, it follows that $k \\ge n_0$.\n- Also, since $k  m$ and $m$ is the *least* element of $S$, $k$ cannot be in $S$. This means $P(k)$ must be true.\n- But we are given the inductive step: $\\forall k \\ge n_0, [P(k) \\implies P(k+2)]$. Since we have established that $k = m-2 \\ge n_0$ and that $P(k)$ is true, this step implies that $P(k+2)$ is true.\n- $P(k+2) = P((m-2)+2) = P(m)$.\n- This leads to the conclusion that $P(m)$ is true, which contradicts the definition of $m$ as an element of $S$ (for which $P(m)$ is false).\n- This contradiction proves that our initial assumption (that $S$ is non-empty) must be false. Therefore, $S$ is empty, and $P(n)$ is true for all $n \\ge n_0$.\nThis argument relies critically on the fact that $m \\ge n_0+2$, which is guaranteed only if both $P(n_0)$ and $P(n_0+1)$ are established as base cases.\n\nTherefore, the correct setup requires proving the two base cases $P(n_0)$ and $P(n_0+1)$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Prove the base cases $P(n_0)$ and $P(n_0+1)$, and then apply the step $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+2)$ for all $k\\ge n_0$.**\nAs demonstrated in the derivation above, proving $P(n_0)$ establishes the truth for the sequence $\\{n_0, n_0+2, n_0+4, \\dots \\}$, and proving $P(n_0+1)$ establishes the truth for the sequence $\\{n_0+1, n_0+3, n_0+5, \\dots \\}$. Together, these cover all integers $n \\ge n_0$. This is the necessary and sufficient set of base cases.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Prove the base cases $P(n_0)$ and $P(n_0+2)$, and then apply the step $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+2)$ for all $k\\ge n_0$.**\nIf one proves $P(n_0)$, the given inductive step with $k=n_0$ already implies $P(n_0+2)$. So, proving $P(n_0+2)$ is redundant. Most importantly, this choice of base cases provides no starting point for the sequence $\\{n_0+1, n_0+3, n_0+5, \\dots \\}$. The truth of $P(n)$ for any $n$ in this sequence cannot be inferred.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Prove the base cases $P(n_0+1)$ and $P(n_0+3)$, and then apply the step $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+2)$ for all $k\\ge n_0$.**\nThis choice fails to prove the statement for $n=n_0$, which is the very first value in the required range $n \\ge n_0$. It also fails to prove the statement for $n_0+2, n_0+4$, etc. This approach only proves $P(n)$ for $n \\in \\{n_0+1, n_0+3, n_0+5, \\dots \\}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Prove only the base case $P(n_0)$, and then use strong induction to deduce $P(n)$ for all $n\\ge n_0$ from the step $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+2)$.**\nProving only $P(n_0)$ is insufficient. It only allows the proof to proceed for the sequence $\\{n_0, n_0+2, n_0+4, \\dots \\}$. No information is provided to prove $P(n_0+1)$. The invocation of \"strong induction\" does not alter this, because the given implication is only from $P(k)$ to $P(k+2)$. In the strong induction framework, to prove $P(k+1)$, one assumes $P(j)$ for all $n_0 \\le j \\le k$. However, the given step does not provide a link from any of these prior statements to $P(k+1)$. Specifically, to prove $P(n_0+1)$, one could only assume $P(n_0)$, but the step $P(n_0) \\Rightarrow P(n_0+2)$ is of no help.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Prove the base cases $P(n_0)$ and $P(n_0+3)$, and then apply the step $P(k)\\Rightarrow P(k+2)$ for all $k\\ge n_0$.**\nProving $P(n_0)$ establishes the truth for $\\{n_0, n_0+2, n_0+4, \\dots \\}$. Proving $P(n_0+3)$ establishes the truth for $\\{n_0+3, n_0+5, n_0+7, \\dots \\}$. This leaves the case $n=n_0+1$ unproven. Since $P(n_0+1)$ cannot be established, the proof is incomplete.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3086078"}]}
