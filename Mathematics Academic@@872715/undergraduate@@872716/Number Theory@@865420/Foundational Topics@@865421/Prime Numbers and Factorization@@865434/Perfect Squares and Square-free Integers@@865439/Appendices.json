Express your final answer as the exact integer value of $n$.", "solution": "The problem requires us to find all positive integers $n$ that are simultaneously perfect squares and square-free. We must derive this result using the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (FTA) and the definitions of these properties.\n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, if $n > 1$, it can be written as a unique product of prime powers:\n$$n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$$\nwhere $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$ are distinct prime numbers and $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k$ are positive integers. For the case $n=1$, its prime factorization is represented by an empty product, which means for any prime $p$, its exponent in the factorization of $1$ is $0$.\n\nFirst, we establish the condition for $n$ to be a perfect square in terms of its prime factorization exponents.\nA positive integer $n$ is a perfect square if there exists an integer $m$ such that $n = m^2$. Let the prime factorization of $m$ be $m = p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} \\cdots p_k^{b_k}$, where the exponents $b_i$ are non-negative integers.\nThen, $n$ can be expressed as:\n$$n = m^2 = (p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} \\cdots p_k^{b_k})^2 = p_1^{2b_1} p_2^{2b_2} \\cdots p_k^{2b_k}$$\nBy the uniqueness of prime factorization guaranteed by the FTA, the exponents $a_i$ in the prime factorization of $n$ must be equal to the corresponding exponents $2b_i$. This implies that each exponent $a_i$ must be an even non-negative integer.\nSo, the necessary and sufficient condition for $n$ to be a perfect square is that for every prime $p$, if $v_p(n)$ is the exponent of $p$ in the prime factorization of $n$, then $v_p(n)$ must be an even integer. That is, $a_i \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6, \\ldots\\}$.\n\nSecond, we establish the condition for $n$ to be a square-free integer.\nA positive integer $n$ is defined as square-free if it is not divisible by any perfect square other than $1$. This is equivalent to stating that none of its prime factors appear with an exponent greater than $1$. If any exponent $a_j$ in the prime factorization of $n$ were greater than or equal to $2$, then $p_j^2$ would be a perfect square greater than $1$ that divides $n$. To avoid this, every exponent $a_j$ must be strictly less than $2$.\nSince the exponents in the prime factorization are non-negative integers, the only possible values for them are $0$ or $1$.\nSo, the necessary and sufficient condition for $n$ to be square-free is that for every prime $p$, the exponent $v_p(n)$ must be either $0$ or $1$. That is, $a_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\nNow, we must find the integers $n$ that satisfy both conditions simultaneously. For an integer $n$ to be both a perfect square and square-free, the exponents $a_i$ in its prime factorization must satisfy both derived conditions.\nLet $A_{sq}$ be the set of possible exponents for a perfect square, and $A_{sf}$ be the set of possible exponents for a square-free integer.\n$$A_{sq} = \\{0, 2, 4, 6, \\ldots\\}$$\n$$A_{sf} = \\{0, 1\\}$$\nThe exponents in the prime factorization of an integer that is both a perfect square and square-free must belong to the intersection of these two sets, $A_{sq} \\cap A_{sf}$.\n$$A_{sq} \\cap A_{sf} = \\{0, 2, 4, \\ldots\\} \\cap \\{0, 1\\} = \\{0\\}$$\nThis intersection contains only the integer $0$. Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for $n$ to be simultaneously a perfect square and square-free is that all exponents in its prime factorization must be $0$.\n\nLet's determine the integer $n$ that satisfies this condition. If for every prime $p_i$, its exponent $a_i$ in the factorization of $n$ is $0$, then:\n$$n = p_1^0 \\cdot p_2^0 \\cdot p_3^0 \\cdots$$\nSince any non-zero number raised to the power of $0$ is $1$, we have:\n$$n = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdots = 1$$\nThus, the only positive integer that is both a perfect square and square-free is $1$.\n\nWe can verify this conclusion directly:\n1. Is $n=1$ a perfect square? Yes, because $1 = 1^2$.\n2. Is $n=1$ square-free? Yes, because the only perfect square that divides $1$ is $1$ itself. The definition of a square-free integer is that it is not divisible by any perfect square *other than 1*.

An integer $n$ is square-free if $|n|$ is not divisible by $p^2$ for any prime $p$.\n\n**A. $n$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Z}$ if and only if $n > 0$ and $v_p(n)$ is even for all primes $p$.**\n\nThis is a biconditional statement. We must prove both directions.\n\n($\\Rightarrow$) Assume $n$ is a perfect square. By definition, $n = s^2$ for some integer $s$. Since $n$ is nonzero, $s$ is also nonzero. Thus, $n = s^2 > 0$.\nLet the unique prime factorization of $|s|$ be $|s| = \\prod_p p^{v_p(|s|)}$.\nThen $n = s^2 = |s|^2 = \\left(\\prod_p p^{v_p(|s|)}\\right)^2 = \\prod_p p^{2v_p(|s|)}$.\nBy the uniqueness of prime factorization (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic), the exponent of each prime $p$ in the factorization of $n$ must be unique. Therefore, $v_p(n) = 2v_p(|s|)$ for all primes $p$. Since $v_p(|s|)$ is an integer, $v_p(n)$ must be an even integer for all $p$.\nThus, if $n$ is a perfect square, then $n > 0$ and $v_p(n)$ is even for all primes $p$.\n\n($\\Leftarrow$) Assume $n > 0$ and $v_p(n)$ is even for all primes $p$.\nSince $n > 0$, we have $n = |n|$. The prime factorization of $n$ is $n = \\prod_p p^{v_p(n)}$.\nGiven that $v_p(n)$ is even for all $p$, we can write $v_p(n) = 2k_p$ for some non-negative integers $k_p$.\nSubstituting this into the factorization, we get $n = \\prod_p p^{2k_p} = \\prod_p (p^{k_p})^2 = \\left(\\prod_p p^{k_p}\\right)^2$.\nLet $s = \\prod_p p^{k_p}$. Since only a finite number of $v_p(n)$ are non-zero, only a finite number of $k_p$ are non-zero, so this product is finite and defines an integer $s \\ge 1$.\nTherefore, $n = s^2$, which means $n$ is a perfect square.\n\nBoth directions are true.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. $n$ is square-free if and only if $v_p(n) \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for all primes $p$.**\n\n($\\Rightarrow$) Assume $n$ is square-free. By definition, $|n|$ is not divisible by $p^2$ for any prime $p$. The statement \"$p^2$ does not divide $|n|$\" is equivalent to saying that the highest power of $p$ that divides $|n|$ is less than $2$. The exponent of this highest power is precisely $v_p(|n|)$. Since $v_p(n)=v_p(|n|)$, we have $v_p(n) < 2$. As $v_p(n)$ must be a non-negative integer, this implies $v_p(n) \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. This holds for all primes $p$.\n\n($\\Leftarrow$) Assume $v_p(n) \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ for all primes $p$. This means that for any prime $p$, the highest power of $p$ dividing $n$ (and thus $|n|$) is at most $p^1$. This directly implies that $p^2$ cannot divide $|n|$ for any prime $p$. By definition, this means $n$ is square-free.\n\nBoth directions are true.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. There exist unique integers $s \\geq 1$ and $m \\geq 1$ with $m$ square-free such that $|n| = s^2 m$, and the primes dividing $m$ are precisely those primes $p$ for which $v_p(n)$ is odd.**\n\nThis statement claims existence, uniqueness, and a property of $m$. We verify each part.\n\n*   **Existence:** For any nonzero integer $n$, consider the prime factorization $|n| = \\prod_p p^{v_p(n)}$. For each prime $p$, use the division algorithm to write $v_p(n) = 2q_p + r_p$, where $q_p = \\lfloor v_p(n)/2 \\rfloor$ is the integer quotient and $r_p = v_p(n) \\pmod 2 \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is the remainder.\n    We can then write $|n| = \\prod_p p^{2q_p + r_p} = \\left(\\prod_p p^{2q_p}\\right) \\left(\\prod_p p^{r_p}\\right) = \\left(\\prod_p p^{q_p}\\right)^2 \\left(\\prod_p p^{r_p}\\right)$.\n    Let $s = \\prod_p p^{q_p}$ and $m = \\prod_p p^{r_p}$. Since $n$ is nonzero, $|n| \\ge 1$, which implies $s \\ge 1$ and $m \\ge 1$. For any prime $p$, the $p$-adic valuation of $m$ is $v_p(m) = r_p \\in \\{0,1\\}$. By the result of statement B, $m$ is square-free. Thus, existence is proven.\n\n*   **Uniqueness:** Suppose $|n| = s^2 m = (s')^2 m'$, where $s, s' \\ge 1$ are integers and $m, m' \\ge 1$ are square-free integers. Taking the $p$-adic valuation for any prime $p$: $v_p(|n|) = v_p(s^2m) = 2v_p(s) + v_p(m)$. Similarly, $v_p(|n|) = 2v_p(s') + v_p(m')$.\n    Thus, $2v_p(s) + v_p(m) = 2v_p(s') + v_p(m')$, which implies $v_p(m) - v_p(m') = 2(v_p(s') - v_p(s))$.\n    Since $m$ and $m'$ are square-free, $v_p(m) \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $v_p(m') \\in \\{0,1\\}$. The left side, $v_p(m) - v_p(m')$, can thus only take values in $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. The right side, $2(v_p(s') - v_p(s))$, is an even integer. The only integer that is both in $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ and even is $0$.\n    Thus, $v_p(m) - v_p(m') = 0$ and $2(v_p(s') - v_p(s)) = 0$. This gives $v_p(m) = v_p(m')$ and $v_p(s) = v_p(s')$, for all primes $p$. Since $s, s', m, m'$ are positive integers, they are uniquely determined by their $p$-adic valuations. Therefore, $s=s'$ and $m=m'$. Uniqueness is proven.\n\n*   **Primes dividing $m$**: From the construction, $m = \\prod_p p^{r_p}$ where $r_p = v_p(n) \\pmod 2$. A prime $p_0$ divides $m$ if and only if $v_{p_0}(m) > 0$. Since $v_{p_0}(m) = r_{p_0} \\in \\{0,1\\}$, this is equivalent to $v_{p_0}(m)=1$. This occurs if and only if $r_{p_0} = 1$, which by definition means $v_{p_0}(n)$ is odd.\n\nAll parts of the statement are true.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. If $v_p(n)$ is even for all primes $p$, then $n$ must be a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Z}$, regardless of the sign of $n$.**\n\nLet us test this statement. Assume $v_p(n)$ is even for all primes $p$.\nFrom the reasoning in A, this implies that $|n|$ is a perfect square. Let $|n| = s^2$ for some integer $s \\ge 1$.\nThen $n = \\operatorname{sgn}(n) |n| = \\operatorname{sgn}(n) s^2$.\nA perfect square in $\\mathbb{Z}$ must be non-negative. If $n$ is negative, $n$ cannot be a perfect square.\nConsider the counterexample $n = -4$. Then $|n| = 4 = 2^2$.\nThe $p$-adic valuations are: $v_2(-4) = v_2(4) = 2$ (even), and for any prime $p \\ne 2$, $v_p(-4) = 0$ (even).\nSo, $v_p(-4)$ is even for all primes $p$. However, $n=-4$ is not a perfect square, as no integer squared equals $-4$. The statement is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. If there exists a prime $p$ with $v_p(n) \\geq 2$, then $n$ is not square-free.**\n\nLet's prove this directly. Assume there exists a prime $p_0$ such that $v_{p_0}(n) \\ge 2$.\nBy definition of the $p$-adic valuation, $p_0^{v_{p_0}(n)}$ is the highest power of $p_0$ that divides $n$.\nSince $v_{p_0}(n) \\ge 2$, it implies that $p_0^2$ divides $n$.\nIf $p_0^2$ divides $n$, then $p_0^2$ also divides $|n|$.\nThe definition of a square-free integer requires that for ALL primes $p$, $p^2$ does not divide $|n|$.\nWe have found a prime $p_0$ for which $p_0^2$ *does* divide $|n|$. Therefore, $n$ does not satisfy the definition of a square-free integer.\nThe statement is true. An alternative proof is via the contrapositive: if $n$ is square-free, then by statement B, $v_p(n) \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for all primes $p$, which implies that there is no prime $p$ with $v_p(n) \\ge 2$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**F. If $v_p(n)$ is odd for some prime $p$, then $n$ cannot be a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Z}$.**\n\nThis statement is the contrapositive of one of the implications in statement A. Let's verify it directly.\nLet $n$ be a perfect square. Then $n=s^2$ for some nonzero integer $s$.\nAs shown in the analysis of statement A, the $p$-adic valuation of a perfect square is always even: $v_p(n) = v_p(s^2) = 2v_p(s)$ for all primes $p$.\nThis means that if $n$ is a perfect square, all its $p$-adic valuations must be even.\nThe initial assumption is that there exists some prime $p_0$ for which $v_{p_0}(n)$ is odd. This is a direct contradiction to the necessary condition for $n$ to be a perfect square.\nTherefore, if $v_p(n)$ is odd for some prime $p$, $n$ cannot be a perfect square.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nSummary of verdicts:\nA: Correct\nB: Correct\nC: Correct\nD: Incorrect\nE: Correct\nF: Correct", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCEF}$$", "id": "3088064"}, {"introduction": "Finally, we bridge our understanding of square-free integers to the field of analytic number theory.

We will show that for any positive integer $n$,\n$$\n\\mu^2(n) = \\sum_{d^2|n} \\mu(d)\n$$\nwhere the sum is over all integers $d$ such that $d^2$ divides $n$.\n\nTo prove this identity, let the prime factorization of $n$ be $n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$.\nThe condition $d^2|n$ requires that for any prime $q$ dividing $d$, we must have $q^2$ dividing $n$. For $\\mu(d)$ to be non-zero, $d$ must be square-free. Thus, any such $d$ must be a product of distinct primes. Let $d = q_1 q_2 \\cdots q_r$. Then $d^2 = q_1^2 q_2^2 \\cdots q_r^2$.
