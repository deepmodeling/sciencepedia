It provides a complete and consistent set of information and definitions required for a unique solution. The numbers are small and the context is a standard example in an introductory cryptography or number theory course. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nWe now proceed to the solution. The goal is to compute the order of the element $2$ in the group $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times}$ and determine if $2$ is a primitive root modulo $11$.\n\nFirst, we determine the order of the group using the provided facts. For the prime $p=11$, the order of the group $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times}$ is given by Euler's totient function, $|\\left(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times}| = \\varphi(11) = 11-1 = 10$.\n\nNext, we must find the order of the element $g=2$. Let the order of $2$ be denoted by $k$. By definition, $k$ is the smallest positive integer such that $2^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. According to the provided principles, the order of an element must divide the order of the group. Therefore, $k$ must be a divisor of $10$. The positive divisors of $10$ are $1$, $2$, $5$, and $10$.\n\nWe will test these divisors in increasing order to find the smallest one that satisfies the condition for the order.\n\n1.  Test $k=1$: $2^1 = 2$. Since $2 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, the order is not $1$.\n2.  Test $k=2$: $2^2 = 4$. Since $4 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, the order is not $2$.\n3.  Test $k=5$: $2^5 = 32$. To evaluate this modulo $11$, we perform division: $32 = 2 \\times 11 + 10$. Thus, $2^5 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$. Since $10 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, the order is not $5$.\n4.  Test $k=10$: We have already established that the order must be a divisor of $10$. Since it is not $1$, $2$, or $5$, the only remaining possibility is $10$. We can verify this directly. Using the result from the previous step, $2^{10} = (2^5)^2 \\equiv 10^2 \\pmod{11}$. Calculating $10^2 = 100$. To evaluate this modulo $11$, we perform division: $100 = 9 \\times 11 + 1$. Thus, $2^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. This is also consistent with Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that since $\\gcd(2,11)=1$, it must be that $2^{11-1} \\equiv 2^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\n\nSince $k=10$ is the smallest positive integer for which $2^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, the order of $2$ in $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times}$ is $10$.\n\nFinally, we must determine if $2$ is a primitive root modulo $11$. An element is a primitive root modulo a prime $p$ if its order is equal to $p-1$. For $p=11$, this required order is $11-1=10$. As we have just computed, the order of $2$ modulo $11$ is indeed $10$. Therefore, $2$ is a primitive root modulo $11$.\n\nThe final answer is to be expressed as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix}\\text{order}  \\text{indicator}\\end{pmatrix}$. The order is $10$.

All necessary data are provided, and the required quantities can be uniquely determined. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**. We proceed with the derivation and computation.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of three quantities related to the RSA cryptosystem: the modulus $n$, Euler's totient function $\\varphi(n)$, and the private exponent $d$. We are given two distinct prime numbers, $p=61$ and $q=53$, and the public exponent $e=17$.\n\nFirst, we compute the modulus $n$. In the RSA algorithm, the modulus $n$ is defined as the product of two large, distinct prime numbers, which in this problem are denoted by $p$ and $q$.\n$$n = p \\times q$$\nSubstituting the given values $p=61$ and $q=53$:\n$$n = 61 \\times 53$$\nThe computation is performed as follows:\n$$n = 61 \\times (50 + 3) = 61 \\times 50 + 61 \\times 3 = 3050 + 183 = 3233$$\nThus, the modulus is $n = 3233$.\n\nSecond, we compute the value of Euler's totient function, $\\varphi(n)$. By definition, $\\varphi(n)$ counts the number of positive integers up to $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$. A key property of the totient function is that it is multiplicative. This means that if two integers $a$ and $b$ are coprime, then $\\varphi(ab) = \\varphi(a)\\varphi(b)$. Since $p$ and $q$ are distinct prime numbers, they are, by definition, coprime. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\\varphi(n) = \\varphi(pq) = \\varphi(p)\\varphi(q)$$\nFor any prime number $k$, all integers from $1$ to $k-1$ are coprime to $k$. Thus, the value of the totient function for a prime $k$ is $\\varphi(k) = k-1$. Applying this to our primes $p$ and $q$:\n$$\\varphi(p) = p - 1$$\n$$\\varphi(q) = q - 1$$\nCombining these results, we derive the formula for $\\varphi(n)$:\n$$\\varphi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)$$\nSubstituting the given values $p=61$ and $q=53$:\n$$\\varphi(n) = (61 - 1)(53 - 1) = 60 \\times 52$$\nThe computation is as follows:\n$$\\varphi(n) = 60 \\times 52 = 3120$$\nThus, the value of Euler's totient function is $\\varphi(n) = 3120$.\n\nThird, we compute the private exponent $d$. The problem states that $d$ is the least positive integer satisfying the congruence relation $ed \\equiv 1 \\pmod{\\varphi(n)}$. This means $d$ is the modular multiplicative inverse of $e$ modulo $\\varphi(n)$. We are given $e=17$ and we have calculated $\\varphi(n)=3120$. The congruence is:\n$$17d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3120}$$\nFor an inverse to exist, $e$ and $\\varphi(n)$ must be coprime, i.e., $\\gcd(e, \\varphi(n)) = 1$. Since $e=17$ is a prime number, we only need to check if $17$ is a factor of $3120$. The division $3120 \\div 17$ yields approximately $183.5$, which is not an integer. Therefore, $\\gcd(17, 3120) = 1$, and a unique modular inverse for $d$ exists.\n\nTo find $d$, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to solve the Diophantine equation $17d + 3120k = 1$ for integers $d$ and $k$. The algorithm proceeds by finding the greatest common divisor of $3120$ and $17$:\n\\begin{align*} 3120 = 183 \\times 17 + 9 \\\\ 17 = 1 \\times 9 + 8 \\\\ 9 = 1 \\times 8 + 1 \\end{align*}\nThe last non-zero remainder is $1$, confirming $\\gcd(3120, 17) = 1$. Now, we work backwards to express $1$ as a linear combination of $17$ and $3120$:\nFrom the third equation, $1 = 9 - 1 \\times 8$.\nSubstitute $8$ from the second equation, $8 = 17 - 1 \\times 9$:\n$$1 = 9 - 1 \\times (17 - 1 \\times 9) = 9 - 17 + 9 = 2 \\times 9 - 1 \\times 17$$\nSubstitute $9$ from the first equation, $9 = 3120 - 183 \\times 17$:\n$$1 = 2 \\times (3120 - 183 \\times 17) - 1 \\times 17$$\n$$1 = 2 \\times 3120 - 366 \\times 17 - 1 \\times 17$$\n$$1 = 2 \\times 3120 - 367 \\times 17$$\nThis equation can be written as $(-367) \\times 17 + 2 \\times 3120 = 1$. Taking this equation modulo $3120$:\n$$(-367) \\times 17 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3120}$$\nThis shows that $d \\equiv -367 \\pmod{3120}$. The problem requires the least positive integer value for $d$.
