Provide the final value of $p_3/q_3$ as a single exact rational number.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically and mathematically sound, belonging to the field of elementary number theory. The definitions of a finite simple continued fraction and its convergents are standard and correctly stated. The problem is well-posed, as the value of a finite continued fraction is a unique rational number, and all necessary data (the coefficients $a_i$) are provided. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a straightforward computational problem designed to test the understanding of fundamental definitions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe given finite continued fraction is $x = [2; 1, 2, 3]$. This corresponds to the coefficients $a_0 = 2$, $a_1 = 1$, $a_2 = 2$, and $a_3 = 3$.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of the $3$-rd convergent, $p_3/q_3$. According to the definition provided, the $k$-th convergent $p_k/q_k$ is the value of the truncated continued fraction $[a_0; a_1, \\dots, a_k]$. For $k=3$, the convergent is $p_3/q_3 = [a_0; a_1, a_2, a_3]$, which in this case is $[2; 1, 2, 3]$.\n\nThis means we must evaluate the nested expression corresponding to $[2; 1, 2, 3]$:\n$$\n\\frac{p_3}{q_3} = [2; 1, 2, 3] = 2 + \\cfrac{1}{1 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\cfrac{1}{3}}}\n$$\nTo evaluate this expression, we work from the innermost part outwards.\n\nFirst, we compute the value of the innermost sum:\n$$\n2 + \\cfrac{1}{3} = \\cfrac{2 \\cdot 3}{3} + \\cfrac{1}{3} = \\cfrac{6+1}{3} = \\cfrac{7}{3}\n$$\nNext, we substitute this result back into the larger expression:\n$$\n1 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\cfrac{1}{3}} = 1 + \\cfrac{1}{\\frac{7}{3}}\n$$\nThe reciprocal of $\\frac{7}{3}$ is $\\frac{3}{7}$. So, the expression becomes:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{7}{7} + \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{10}{7}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this result into the full expression for the continued fraction:\n$$\n2 + \\cfrac{1}{1 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\cfrac{1}{3}}} = 2 + \\cfrac{1}{\\frac{10}{7}}\n$$\nThe reciprocal of $\\frac{10}{7}$ is $\\frac{7}{10}$. The final calculation is:\n$$\n2 + \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 10}{10} + \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{20+7}{10} = \\frac{27}{10}\n$$\nThus, the value of the $3$-rd convergent is $p_3/q_3 = \\frac{27}{10}$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to verify that this value equals the rational number obtained by directly evaluating the nested expression for $x = [2; 1, 2, 3]$. By the very definition of a finite continued fraction, its value is given by the evaluation of its full nested expression. The calculation performed above is precisely this direct evaluation. Since the continued fraction $x=[2;1,2,3]$ is truncated at $a_3$, its value is, by definition, its own final ($3$-rd) convergent, $p_3/q_3$. Therefore, the computation of $p_3/q_3$ is identical to the computation of the value of $x$, and the verification is inherent in the definitions. The value of $p_3/q_3$ is demonstrably equal to the value of $x$, with both being $\\frac{27}{10}$.

We apply the rule $[...; a_{k-1}, 0, a_{k+1}, ...] \\to [...; a_{k-1}+a_{k+1}, ...]$ repeatedly until no such zeros remain. Each application of this rule reduces the number of partial quotients by two. Since the initial fraction is finite, this process must terminate. The order of elimination of zeros does not affect the final sequence of non-zero partial quotients. For instance, reducing $[...; a, 0, b, c, 0, d, ...]$ yields $[...; a+b, c+d, ...]$ regardless of which zero is handled first. Since we assumed $a_i \\ge 0$ for $i \\ge 1$, the newly formed quotients $a_{k-1}+a_{k+1}$ are also non-negative. After this stage, we obtain a finite continued fraction $[b_0; b_1, \\dots, b_m]$ where $b_i \\in \\mathbb{N}$ for all $i \\ge 1$. This is a finite simple continued fraction.\n\nSecond, we ensure the last partial quotient is at least $2$. After the first stage, we have a simple continued fraction $[b_0; b_1, \\dots, b_m]$. If $m=0$, the number is an integer and is already in canonical form. If $m > 0$ and the last quotient $b_m > 1$, the fraction is already in canonical form. If $b_m=1$ (and $m \\ge 1$), we apply the second rule: $[...; b_{m-1}, 1] \\to [...; b_{m-1}+1]$. This transformation reduces the length of the continued fraction by one and produces a new last partial quotient $b'_{m-1} = b_{m-1}+1$. Since $b_{m-1} \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we have $b_{m-1} \\ge 1$, which implies $b'_{m-1} \\ge 2$. The resulting continued fraction is now in canonical form.\n\nThis two-stage process is deterministic and terminates, thus yielding a unique canonical representation for any value represented by a finite continued fraction with non-negative integer partial quotients.\n\n**4.

The partial quotients are $a_0 = -2$, $a_1 = 0$, $a_2 = 1$, $a_3 = 2$, $a_4 = 0$, $a_5 = 4$, $a_6 = 1$, $a_7 = 0$, $a_8 = 3$, $a_9 = 1$, $a_{10} = 1$.
