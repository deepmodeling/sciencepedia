It is based on standard definitions from number theory concerning decimal and continued fraction expansions. The subject matter is squarely within the specified domain. The specific number $x=\\frac{2}{11}$ is a rational number, for which the properties of its decimal and continued fraction expansions are well-established. The tasks are specific, objective, and lead to a unique, verifiable solution. The problem contains no scientific or factual unsoundness, is not ill-posed, and provides all necessary information, including a crucial definition for the period length of a finite SCF.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the three tasks sequentially for the number $x=\\frac{2}{11}$.\n\n**1. Computation of the decimal expansion period length, $L_{\\mathrm{dec}}$**\n\nTo find the decimal expansion of $x=\\frac{2}{11}$, we perform long division of $2$ by $11$.\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r} 0.1818... \\\\ 11 \\overline{) 2.0000...} \\\\ - \\underline{0} \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad \\\\ 2.0 \\quad\\quad\\quad \\\\ - \\underline{1.1} \\quad\\quad\\quad \\\\ 0.90 \\quad\\quad \\\\ - \\underline{0.88} \\quad\\quad \\\\ 0.020 \\quad \\\\ - \\underline{0.011} \\quad \\\\ 0.0090 \\\\ - \\underline{0.0088} \\\\ 0.0002\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe sequence of remainders is $2, 9, 2, 9, \\dots$. Since a remainder ($2$) has reappeared, the sequence of digits in the quotient will repeat from that point. The repeating block of digits is $18$.\nThus, the decimal expansion of $x$ is $0.\\overline{18}$.\nThe length of the minimal repeating block is the number of digits in `$18`', which is $2$.\nTherefore, the decimal period length is $L_{\\mathrm{dec}} = 2$.\n\n**2. Computation of the simple continued fraction (SCF) and its period length, $L_{\\mathrm{cf}}$**\n\nWe apply the standard continued fraction algorithm to $x_0 = \\frac{2}{11}$. The algorithm is an iterative process defined by $a_k = \\lfloor x_k \\rfloor$ and $x_{k+1} = \\frac{1}{x_k - a_k}$ for $x_k$ not an integer.\n\n- Step 0:\n$x_0 = \\frac{2}{11}$. The integer part is $a_0 = \\lfloor \\frac{2}{11} \\rfloor = 0$.\nThe remainder is $\\frac{2}{11} - 0 = \\frac{2}{11}$.\n\n- Step 1:\n$x_1 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{2}{11}} = \\frac{11}{2}$. The integer part is $a_1 = \\lfloor \\frac{11}{2} \\rfloor = 5$.\nThe remainder is $\\frac{11}{2} - 5 = \\frac{11-10}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n- Step 2:\n$x_2 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2$. The integer part is $a_2 = \\lfloor 2 \\rfloor = 2$.\nThe remainder is $2 - 2 = 0$.\n\nSince the remainder is $0$, the algorithm terminates. The resulting SCF is finite.\nThe expansion is $x = [a_0; a_1, a_2] = [0; 5, 2]$.\nAccording to the problem's explicit definition, \"the continued fraction period length of a finite SCF to be $0$\".\nTherefore, the continued fraction period length is $L_{\\mathrm{cf}} = 0$.\n\n**3. Explanation and Clarification**\n\nWe have found that for $x=\\frac{2}{11}$, the decimal expansion is periodic with period length $L_{\\mathrm{dec}}=2$, while its SCF is finite with period length $L_{\\mathrm{cf}}=0$. This single, explicit example is a counterexample to the proposition that \"if a number's decimal expansion is periodic, then its SCF is periodic (with period $p \\ge 1$)\". Thus, the example demonstrates that periodic decimal expansion does not imply a periodic SCF.\n\nThe fundamental reason for this lies in the classes of numbers that these two properties characterize.\n- **Periodic Decimal Expansions**: A fundamental theorem of number theory states that a real number has a periodic or terminating decimal expansion if and only if it is a **rational number** ($x \\in \\mathbb{Q}$). Terminating decimals can be seen as periodic with a repeating block of $0$s (e.g., $0.5 = 0.5000\\dots$). Since $x=\\frac{2}{11}$ is rational, its decimal expansion must be periodic, which we have confirmed.\n\n- **Periodic vs. Finite SCFs**: The nature of a number's SCF also characterizes its class.\n    - A number has a **finite** SCF if and only if it is a **rational number** ($x \\in \\mathbb{Q}$). This is because the Euclidean algorithm, which is equivalent to the SCF algorithm for rationals $\\frac{p}{q}$, must terminate in a finite number of steps. Our rational number $x=\\frac{2}{11}$ correctly yielded a finite SCF, $[0; 5, 2]$.\n    - A number has an **infinite periodic** SCF (i.e., with period $p \\ge 1$) if and only if it is a **quadratic irrational number**. This is Lagrange's Continued Fraction Theorem. A quadratic irrational is an irrational number that is a solution to a quadratic equation $Ax^2+Bx+C=0$ for integers $A, B, C$ with $A \\neq 0$.\n\nIn summary, for any rational number $x$:\n1. Its decimal expansion is necessarily periodic.\n2. Its SCF is necessarily finite.\n\nA finite SCF, by definition, does not have a repeating block of partial quotients of length $p \\ge 1$. The problem formalizes this by assigning a period length of $L_{\\mathrm{cf}}=0$. This is distinct from an infinite periodic SCF, which must have $L_{\\mathrm{cf}} \\ge 1$. Therefore, being a rational number guarantees a periodic decimal expansion but simultaneously guarantees a finite, and thus not periodic (in the sense of $p \\ge 1$), continued fraction expansion. The two properties—periodic decimal and periodic SCF—characterize disjoint sets of numbers: the former characterizes rationals, while the latter characterizes quadratic irrationals.\n\nThe final values computed are $L_{\\mathrm{dec}}=2$ and $L_{\\mathrm{cf}}=0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{(2, 0)}\n$$", "id": "3088112"}, {"introduction": "Having established that periodic continued fractions characterize quadratic irrationals, we now explore one of their most significant applications: solving Pell's equation.

All premises and definitions are standard and correct.\n\nThe solution is divided into the three parts as requested.\n\n**1. Simple Continued Fraction of $\\sqrt{2}$**\n\nTo find the simple continued fraction (SCF) of $\\sqrt{2}$, we use the standard algorithm. Let $\\alpha_0 = \\sqrt{2}$. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n$a_k = \\lfloor \\alpha_k \\rfloor$\n$\\alpha_{k+1} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_k - a_k}$\n\nFor $k=0$:\n$\\alpha_0 = \\sqrt{2}$. Since $1  \\sqrt{2}  2$, the integer part is $a_0 = \\lfloor \\sqrt{2} \\rfloor = 1$.\nThe remainder is $\\alpha_0 - a_0 = \\sqrt{2} - 1$.\n\nFor $k=1$:\n$\\alpha_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} - 1}$. To find its integer part, we rationalize the denominator:\n$\\alpha_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} - 1} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2} + 1}{\\sqrt{2} + 1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} + 1}{2-1} = \\sqrt{2} + 1$.\nSince $1  \\sqrt{2}  2$, we have $2  \\sqrt{2} + 1  3$. So, the integer part is $a_1 = \\lfloor \\sqrt{2} + 1 \\rfloor = 2$.\nThe remainder is $\\alpha_1 - a_1 = (\\sqrt{2}+1) - 2 = \\sqrt{2} - 1$.\n\nFor $k=2$:\n$\\alpha_2 = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_1 - a_1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} - 1}$.\nThis is the same expression as $\\alpha_1$. Therefore, $\\alpha_2 = \\alpha_1 = \\sqrt{2}+1$, which means $a_2 = a_1 = 2$.\nSince $\\alpha_{k+1}$ depends only on $\\alpha_k$, the sequence of $\\alpha_k$ values, and thus the sequence of partial quotients $a_k$, will be periodic from this point on. We have $\\alpha_k = \\sqrt{2}+1$ and $a_k = 2$ for all $k \\ge 1$.\n\nThe sequence of partial quotients is $a_0 = 1, a_1 = 2, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 2, \\dots$.\nThe simple continued fraction expansion of $\\sqrt{2}$ is:\n$$ \\sqrt{2} = 1 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\ddots}}} $$\nThis is commonly written as $[1; 2, 2, 2, \\dots]$ or $[1; \\overline{2}]$.\nThe period of the continued fraction is the repeating block, which is $\\{2\\}$. The length of the period is $1$.\n\n**2. Pell's Equation and the Convergents of $\\sqrt{2}$**\n\nThe convergents $\\frac{p_k}{q_k}$ of the SCF are calculated using the recurrence relations:\n$p_k = a_k p_{k-1} + p_{k-2}$\n$q_k = a_k q_{k-1} + q_{k-2}$\nwith initial values $p_{-1}=1, q_{-1}=0, p_0=a_0=1, q_0=1$.\n\nLet's compute the first few convergents for $\\sqrt{2}=[1; \\overline{2}]$, where $a_0=1$ and $a_k=2$ for $k \\ge 1$:\n- $k=0$: $\\frac{p_0}{q_0} = \\frac{1}{1}$\n- $k=1$: $p_1 = a_1 p_0 + p_{-1} = 2(1) + 1 = 3$; $q_1 = a_1 q_0 + q_{-1} = 2(1) + 0 = 2$. Convergent is $\\frac{3}{2}$.\n- $k=2$: $p_2 = a_2 p_1 + p_0 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$; $q_2 = a_2 q_1 + q_0 = 2(2) + 1 = 5$. Convergent is $\\frac{7}{5}$.\n- $k=3$: $p_3 = a_3 p_2 + p_1 = 2(7) + 3 = 17$; $q_3 = a_3 q_2 + q_1 = 2(5) + 2 = 12$. Convergent is $\\frac{17}{12}$.\n- $k=4$: $p_4 = a_4 p_3 + p_2 = 2(17) + 7 = 41$; $q_4 = a_4 q_3 + q_2 = 2(12) + 5 = 29$. Convergent is $\\frac{41}{29}$.\n\nNow, let's substitute these pairs $(p_k, q_k)$ into the expression $x^2 - 2y^2$:\n- $(p_0, q_0)=(1,1): 1^2 - 2(1^2) = 1 - 2 = -1$.\n- $(p_1, q_1)=(3,2): 3^2 - 2(2^2) = 9 - 8 = 1$.\n- $(p_2, q_2)=(7,5): 7^2 - 2(5^2) = 49 - 50 = -1$.\n- $(p_3, q_3)=(17,12): 17^2 - 2(12^2) = 289 - 2(144) = 289 - 288 = 1$.\n- $(p_4, q_4)=(41,29): 41^2 - 2(29^2) = 1681 - 2(841) = 1681 - 1682 = -1$.\n\nThe pattern observed is $p_k^2 - 2q_k^2 = (-1)^{k+1}$. This is a known property of convergents of $\\sqrt{D}$. For any solution to the Pell equation $x^2 - 2y^2 = 1$, we must have $p_k^2 - 2q_k^2 = 1$. This occurs when the exponent $k+1$ is even, which means $k$ must be odd.\n\nTherefore, the pairs $(x,y) = (p_k, q_k)$ for $k=1, 3, 5, \\dots$ provide solutions to the Pell equation $x^2 - 2y^2 = 1$.\nThe sequences of numerators $p_k$ and denominators $q_k$ of the convergents are strictly increasing for $k \\ge 1$. Since there are infinitely many odd integers $k$, there are infinitely many distinct convergents $\\frac{p_k}{q_k}$ with $k$ odd. Each of these convergents provides a distinct solution $(x,y)=(p_k,q_k)$ to the equation. This proves that there are infinitely many integer pairs $(x,y)$ that solve $x^2 - 2y^2 = 1$.\nThese solutions are the numerators and denominators of the convergents with odd indices: $(p_1,q_1), (p_3,q_3), (p_5,q_5), \\ldots$.\n\n**3. Closed-Form Expression for Solutions**\n\nWe seek a closed-form expression for the $n$-th positive solution $(x_n, y_n)$, ordered by increasing $x_n$, for $n \\ge 1$. From Part 2, these solutions are given by $(x_n,y_n) = (p_{2n-1}, q_{2n-1})$. To find a closed form, we solve the recurrence relations for $p_k$ and $q_k$.\n\nFor $k \\ge 2$, the partial quotient is always $a_k=2$. The recurrence relations become:\n$p_k = 2 p_{k-1} + p_{k-2}$\n$q_k = 2 q_{k-1} + q_{k-2}$\nThese are linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation for both is $r^2 - 2r - 1 = 0$.\nThe roots are given by the quadratic formula: $r = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{8}}{2} = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{2}$.\nLet the roots be $\\lambda_1 = 1+\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1-\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe general solution for $p_k$ is $p_k = A\\lambda_1^k + B\\lambda_2^k$ for $k \\ge 1$. We use the initial values $p_1=3$ and $p_2=7$ to find the constants $A$ and $B$.\nFor $k=1: 3 = A(1+\\sqrt{2}) + B(1-\\sqrt{2})$.\nFor $k=2: 7 = A(1+\\sqrt{2})^2 + B(1-\\sqrt{2})^2 = A(3+2\\sqrt{2}) + B(3-2\\sqrt{2})$.\nThis can be written as a system:\n$3 = (A+B) + (A-B)\\sqrt{2}$\n$7 = 3(A+B) + 2(A-B)\\sqrt{2}$\nLet $U=A+B$ and $V=(A-B)\\sqrt{2}$. The system is $3 = U+V$ and $7 = 3U+2V$.\nMultiplying the first equation by $2$ gives $6 = 2U+2V$. Subtracting this from the second equation gives $1=U$, so $A+B=1$.\nThen $V = 3-U = 2$, which implies $(A-B)\\sqrt{2}=2$, so $A-B=\\sqrt{2}$.\nSolving for $A$ and $B$: $2A = 1+\\sqrt{2} \\implies A = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, and $2B = 1-\\sqrt{2} \\implies B = \\frac{1-\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\nThe closed form for $p_k$ for $k \\ge 1$ is:\n$p_k = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2}(1+\\sqrt{2})^k + \\frac{1-\\sqrt{2}}{2}(1-\\sqrt{2})^k = \\frac{1}{2}\\left((1+\\sqrt{2})^{k+1} + (1-\\sqrt{2})^{k+1}\\right)$.\n\nSimilarly, for $q_k$, the general solution is $q_k = C\\lambda_1^k + D\\lambda_2^k$ for $k \\ge 1$. We use initial values $q_1=2$ and $q_2=5$.\nFor $k=1: 2 = C(1+\\sqrt{2}) + D(1-\\sqrt{2})$.\nFor $k=2: 5 = C(3+2\\sqrt{2}) + D(3-2\\sqrt{2})$.\nSystem: $2 = (C+D) + (C-D)\\sqrt{2}$ and $5 = 3(C+D) + 2(C-D)\\sqrt{2}$.\nLet $U'=C+D$ and $V'=(C-D)\\sqrt{2}$. The system is $2 = U'+V'$ and $5 = 3U'+2V'$.\n$4 = 2U'+2V'$. Subtracting gives $1=U'$, so $C+D=1$. Then $V'=1$, so $(C-D)\\sqrt{2}=1 \\implies C-D = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nSolving for $C$ and $D$: $2C = 1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\implies C = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{2\\sqrt{2}}$.\n$2D = 1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\implies D = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{2\\sqrt{2}}$.\nThe closed form for $q_k$ for $k \\ge 1$ is:\n$q_k = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{2\\sqrt{2}}(1+\\sqrt{2})^k + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{2\\sqrt{2}}(1-\\sqrt{2})^k = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\left((1+\\sqrt{2})^{k+1} - (1-\\sqrt{2})^{k+1}\\right)$, where we used $(\\sqrt{2}-1) = -(1-\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThe $n$-th positive solution is $(x_n, y_n) = (p_{2n-1}, q_{2n-1})$. We substitute $k=2n-1$ into the formulas for $p_k$ and $q_k$:\n$x_n = p_{2n-1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left((1+\\sqrt{2})^{(2n-1)+1} + (1-\\sqrt{2})^{(2n-1)+1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left((1+\\sqrt{2})^{2n} + (1-\\sqrt{2})^{2n}\\right)$.\n$y_n = q_{2n-1} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\left((1+\\sqrt{2})^{(2n-1)+1} - (1-\\sqrt{2})^{(2n-1)+1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\left((1+\\sqrt{2})^{2n} - (1-\\sqrt{2})^{2n}\\right)$.\n\nWe are asked for an expression for $x_n + y_n\\sqrt{2}$:\n$x_n + y_n\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left((1+\\sqrt{2})^{2n} + (1-\\sqrt{2})^{2n}\\right) + \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\left((1+\\sqrt{2})^{2n} - (1-\\sqrt{2})^{2n}\\right)$\n$x_n + y_n\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left((1+\\sqrt{2})^{2n} + (1-\\sqrt{2})^{2n}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left((1+\\sqrt{2})^{2n} - (1-\\sqrt{2})^{2n}\\right)$\n$x_n + y_n\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( (1+\\sqrt{2})^{2n} + (1-\\sqrt{2})^{2n} + (1+\\sqrt{2})^{2n} - (1-\\sqrt{2})^{2n} \\right)$\n$x_n + y_n\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( 2(1+\\sqrt{2})^{2n} \\right) = (1+\\sqrt{2})^{2n}$.\n\nThis expression can be simplified by evaluating $(1+\\sqrt{2})^2$:\n$(1+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 1^2 + 2(1)\\sqrt{2} + (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 1 + 2\\sqrt{2} + 2 = 3+2\\sqrt{2}$.\nTherefore, the expression for the $n$-th solution is:\n$x_n + y_n\\sqrt{2} = ((1+\\sqrt{2})^2)^n = (3+2\\sqrt{2})^n$.\nThis corresponds to taking powers of the fundamental solution $(x_1,y_1) = (p_1,q_1) = (3,2)$, for which $x_1+y_1\\sqrt{2} = 3+2\\sqrt{2}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{(3+2\\sqrt{2})^n} $$", "id": "3086645"}, {"introduction": "To deepen our understanding of the structure of periodic continued fractions, we now reverse the process: instead of analyzing a given number, we will construct one with a predetermined continued fraction.

The continued fraction $y = [\\overline{1,2}]$ can be written as:\n$$y = [1; 2, 1, 2, \\dots] = 1 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\cfrac{1}{1 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\dots}}}$$\nThis structure implies that $y$ satisfies the equation:\n$$y = 1 + \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{y}}$$\nWe simplify this expression to find the quadratic equation for $y$:\n$$y = 1 + \\frac{y}{2y + 1} = \\frac{(2y + 1) + y}{2y + 1} = \\frac{3y + 1}{2y + 1}$$\nMultiplying by the denominator $(2y + 1)$ gives:\n$$y(2y + 1) = 3y + 1$$\n$$2y^2 + y = 3y + 1$$\n$$2y^2 - 2y - 1 = 0$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=2$, $b=-2$, and $c=-1$:\n$$y = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(2)(-1)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 8}}{4} = \\frac{2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\nSince $y = [1; \\dots]$, its value must be greater than $1$. We therefore choose the positive root:\n$$y = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\nAs a check, we confirm that $y$ is a reduced quadratic irrational. We have $y = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx \\frac{1+1.732}{2} = 1.366 > 1$. Its algebraic conjugate is $y' = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx -0.366$, which satisfies $-1  y'  0$. Thus, $y$ is indeed reduced.\n\nNext, we construct $x$ using the prepended digits $a_0 = 2$, $a_1 = 3$, $a_2 = 4$ and the periodic part $y$. The continued fraction for $x$ is $[a_0; a_1, a_2, y]$.\n$$x = [2; 3, 4, y] = 2 + \\cfrac{1}{3 + \\cfrac{1}{4 + \\cfrac{1}{y}}}$$\nWe compute this value by substituting $y = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and simplifying from the inside out.\nFirst, we find the value of $4 + \\frac{1}{y}$:\n$$4 + \\frac{1}{y} = 4 + \\frac{2}{1 + \\sqrt{3}} = 4 + \\frac{2(1 - \\sqrt{3})}{(1 + \\sqrt{3})(1 - \\sqrt{3})} = 4 + \\frac{2(1 - \\sqrt{3})}{1 - 3} = 4 + \\frac{2(1 - \\sqrt{3})}{-2} = 4 - (1 - \\sqrt{3}) = 3 + \\sqrt{3}$$\nNext, we substitute this into the next level of the fraction:\n$$3 + \\frac{1}{4 + \\frac{1}{y}} = 3 + \\frac{1}{3 + \\sqrt{3}} = 3 + \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{3}}{(3 + \\sqrt{3})(3 - \\sqrt{3})} = 3 + \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{3}}{9 - 3} = 3 + \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{3}}{6} = \\frac{18 + 3 - \\sqrt{3}}{6} = \\frac{21 - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$$\nFinally, we compute $x$:\n$$x = 2 + \\frac{1}{\\frac{21 - \\sqrt{3}}{6}} = 2 + \\frac{6}{21 - \\sqrt{3}}$$\nTo simplify, we rationalize the denominator of the fraction:\n$$\\frac{6}{21 - \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{6(21 + \\sqrt{3})}{(21 - \\sqrt{3})(21 + \\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{6(21 + \\sqrt{3})}{21^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\frac{6(21 + \\sqrt{3})}{441 - 3} = \\frac{6(21 + \\sqrt{3})}{438}$$\nSince $438 = 6 \\times 73$, we can simplify the fraction:\n$$\\frac{6(21 + \\sqrt{3})}{438} = \\frac{21 + \\sqrt{3}}{73}$$\nNow, we substitute this back into the expression for $x$:\n$$x = 2 + \\frac{21 + \\sqrt{3}}{73} = \\frac{2 \\times 73 + 21 + \\sqrt{3}}{73} = \\frac{146 + 21 + \\sqrt{3}}{73} = \\frac{167 + \\sqrt{3}}{73}$$\nThis is the exact value of $x$ in simplified radical form.\n\nTo complete the problem, we verify that three applications of the continued fraction map $T(z) = \\frac{1}{z - \\lfloor z \\rfloor}$ on $x$ recover $y$. Let $x_0 = x$.\n\nStep 1:\n$$x_0 = \\frac{167 + \\sqrt{3}}{73}$$\nSince $1  \\sqrt{3}  2$, we have $168  167 + \\sqrt{3}  169$. Thus, $\\frac{168}{73}  x_0  \\frac{169}{73}$, which is approximately $2.301  x_0  2.315$.\nSo, $a_0 = \\lfloor x_0 \\rfloor = 2$, which matches the first given digit.\nThe first remainder is $x_1$:\n$$x_1 = \\frac{1}{x_0 - a_0} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{167 + \\sqrt{3}}{73} - 2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{167 + \\sqrt{3} - 146}{73}} = \\frac{73}{21 + \\sqrt{3}}$$\n$$x_1 = \\frac{73(21 - \\sqrt{3})}{(21 + \\sqrt{3})(21 - \\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{73(21 - \\sqrt{3})}{438} = \\frac{21 - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$$\n\nStep 2:\n$$x_1 = \\frac{21 - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$$\nSince $1  \\sqrt{3}  2$, we have $19  21 - \\sqrt{3}  20$. Thus, $\\frac{19}{6}  x_1  \\frac{20}{6}$, which is approximately $3.16  x_1  3.34$.\nSo, $a_1 = \\lfloor x_1 \\rfloor = 3$, which matches the second given digit.\nThe second remainder is $x_2$:\n$$x_2 = \\frac{1}{x_1 - a_1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{21 - \\sqrt{3}}{6} - 3} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{21 - \\sqrt{3} - 18}{6}} = \\frac{6}{3 - \\sqrt{3}}$$\n$$x_2 = \\frac{6(3 + \\sqrt{3})}{(3 - \\sqrt{3})(3 + \\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{6(3 + \\sqrt{3})}{9 - 3} = \\frac{6(3 + \\sqrt{3})}{6} = 3 + \\sqrt{3}$$\n\nStep 3:\n$$x_2 = 3 + \\sqrt{3}$$\nSince $1.7  \\sqrt{3}  1.8$, we have $4.7  x_2  4.8$.\nSo, $a_2 = \\lfloor x_2 \\rfloor = 4$, which matches the third given digit.\nThe third remainder is $x_3$:\n$$x_3 = \\frac{1}{x_2 - a_2} = \\frac{1}{(3 + \\sqrt{3}) - 4} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}$$\n$$x_3 = \\frac{1(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)(\\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} + 1}{3 - 1} = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\nThis resulting value $x_3$ is precisely the value of $y$ we started with.
