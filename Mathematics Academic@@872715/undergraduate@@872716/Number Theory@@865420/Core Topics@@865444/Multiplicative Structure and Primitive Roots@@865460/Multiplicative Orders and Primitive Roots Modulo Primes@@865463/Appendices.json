We are instructed to use the prime factorization of $p-1$.\n\nFirst, we establish the framework. We are working within the multiplicative group of integers modulo $97$, denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}/97\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. The order of this group is $\\phi(97) = 97-1 = 96$. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in this group must divide the order of the group.
