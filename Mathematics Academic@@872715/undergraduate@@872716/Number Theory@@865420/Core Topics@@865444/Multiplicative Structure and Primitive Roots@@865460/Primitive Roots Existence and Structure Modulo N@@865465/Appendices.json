Let $p$ be a prime. The group of interest is the multiplicative group of invertible residue classes modulo $p$, denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. The order of this group is $|(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}| = \\phi(p) = p-1$. An element $g \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is a primitive root modulo $p$ if its order, denoted $\\text{ord}_p(g)$, is equal to the order of the group, which is $p-1$.\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element $g$ must divide the order of the group. Thus, $\\text{ord}_p(g)$ must be a divisor of $p-1$.\nAn element $g$ is a primitive root if and only if its order is not a proper divisor of $p-1$. A number $d$ is a proper divisor of $n$ if $d|n$ and $dn$.\n\nLet the prime factorization of $p-1$ be $p-1 = q_1^{a_1} q_2^{a_2} \\cdots q_k^{a_k}$, where $q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_k$ are distinct prime numbers and $a_i \\ge 1$ are integers.\nIf the order of $g$, let's call it $d$, is a proper divisor of $p-1$, then the ratio $\\frac{p-1}{d}$ must be an integer greater than $1$. This means $\\frac{p-1}{d}$ must have at least one prime factor. Let $q_i$ be a prime factor of $\\frac{p-1}{d}$. Then $d$ must be a divisor of $\\frac{p-1}{q_i}$.\nIf $d | \\frac{p-1}{q_i}$, then we can write $\\frac{p-1}{q_i} = m d$ for some integer $m$. In this case, raising $g$ to the power of $\\frac{p-1}{q_i}$ gives:\n$$g^{(p-1)/q_i} = g^{md} = (g^d)^m \\equiv 1^m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$$\nThis shows that if $g$ is *not* a primitive root, its order $d$ is a proper divisor of $p-1$, which in turn implies that there exists at least one distinct prime factor $q_i$ of $p-1$ such that $g^{(p-1)/q_i} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nConversely, let us assume that for an element $g$, we have $g^{(p-1)/q} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ for every distinct prime divisor $q$ of $p-1$. Let $d = \\text{ord}_p(g)$. We know $d | (p-1)$. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $d \\neq p-1$. This means $d$ is a proper divisor of $p-1$. As before, this implies that there exists a prime factor $q_i$ of $p-1$ such that $d$ divides $\\frac{p-1}{q_i}$. But this would mean $g^{(p-1)/q_i} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, the order $d$ must be equal to $p-1$.\n\nThis establishes the criterion:\nAn element $g \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is a primitive root modulo $p$ if and only if for every distinct prime divisor $q$ of $p-1$, the congruence $g^{(p-1)/q} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ holds.\n\nNow we apply this criterion to the case $p=73$.\nThe order of the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/73\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is $p-1 = 73-1 = 72$.\nWe find the prime factorization of $72$:\n$72 = 8 \\times 9 = 2^3 \\times 3^2$.\nThe distinct prime divisors of $72$ are $q_1=2$ and $q_2=3$.\n\nAccording to our derived criterion, an integer $g$ is a primitive root modulo $73$ if and only if it satisfies the following two conditions:\n$1.$ $g^{72/2} \\equiv g^{36} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{73}$\n$2.$ $g^{72/3} \\equiv g^{24} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{73}$\n\nWe now test small positive integer candidates for $g$, starting from $g=2$.\n\nTest $g=2$:\nWe need to compute $2^{36} \\pmod{73}$ and $2^{24} \\pmod{73}$.

We need to find the possible orders of its elements, determine the group's structure, and find the number of elements of order 8.\n\nFirst, we determine the elements and order of the group. The elements are the residue classes of integers coprime to 32. These are the odd integers from 1 to 31. The order of the group is given by Euler's totient function:\n$|G| = \\phi(32) = \\phi(2^5) = 2^5 - 2^4 = 32 - 16 = 16$.\nBy Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element must divide 16. The possible orders are divisors of 16: $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16\\}$.\n\nNext, we find the maximum possible order for any element. Let $a$ be any element in $G$. Since $a$ is odd, we can write $a = 2k+1$ for some integer $k$. Using the binomial theorem, we examine powers of $a$:\n$a^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 4k(k+1) + 1$.\nSince $k(k+1)$ is always even, let $k(k+1)=2m$. Then $a^2 = 4(2m)+1 = 8m+1$, which implies $a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$.\nNow, consider higher powers. Since $a^2$ has the form $8m+1$:\n$a^4 = (a^2)^2 = (8m+1)^2 = 64m^2 + 16m + 1 = 16(4m^2+m)+1$, which implies $a^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$.\nSimilarly, since $a^4$ has the form $16j+1$:\n$a^8 = (a^4)^2 = (16j+1)^2 = 256j^2 + 32j + 1 = 32(8j^2+j)+1$, which implies $a^8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{32}$.\nThis result shows that for any element $a \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/32\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$, its order must divide 8. Therefore, no element can have order 16. This proves that the group is not cyclic, and the maximum possible order is at most 8.\n\nTo find the set of possible orders, we must check if elements with orders dividing 8 actually exist.\n- Order 1: The identity element, $1$, has order 1.\n- Order 2: $17^2 = 289 = 9 \\times 32 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{32}$. The order of 17 is 2.\n- Order 4: Let's check the element 9. $9^2 = 81 \\equiv 17 \\pmod{32}$. $9^4 \\equiv 17^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{32}$. The order of 9 is 4.\n- Order 8: Let's check the element 3. $3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^4=81 \\equiv 17, 3^8 \\equiv 17^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{32}$. Since $3^4 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{32}$, the order of 3 is 8.\nThus, the set of possible orders for elements in $(\\mathbb{Z}/32\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is $\\{1, 2, 4, 8\\}$.\n\nNow, we deduce the isomorphism type of $G$. $G$ is a finite abelian group of order 16. The exponent of the group (the maximum element order) is 8. By the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, a group of order $16=2^4$ can be $C_{16}$, $C_8 \\times C_2$, $C_4 \\times C_4$, $C_4 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, or $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$.\n- The exponent of $C_{16}$ is 16.\n- The exponent of $C_8 \\times C_2$ is $\\operatorname{lcm}(8, 2) = 8$.\n- The exponent of $C_4 \\times C_4$ is $\\operatorname{lcm}(4, 4) = 4$.\n- The exponent of $C_4 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ is 4.\n- The exponent of $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ is 2.\nSince we found the exponent of $G$ to be 8, the only possible structure is $C_8 \\times C_2$.\nSo, $(\\mathbb{Z}/32\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\cong C_8 \\times C_2$.\n\nFinally, we compute $N$, the number of elements of order 8. In the group $C_8 \\times C_2$, an element is a pair $(a, b)$ where $a \\in C_8$ and $b \\in C_2$. The order of $(a, b)$ is $\\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(a), \\operatorname{ord}(b))$. For this to be 8, $\\operatorname{ord}(a)$ must be 8. The order of $b$ can be 1 or 2.\nThe number of elements of order $d$ in a cyclic group $C_n$ is $\\phi(d)$.\n- The number of choices for $a \\in C_8$ with $\\operatorname{ord}(a)=8$ is $\\phi(8) = 8(1 - 1/2) = 4$.\n- The number of choices for $b \\in C_2$ is 2 (the elements of order 1 and 2).\nFor any of the 4 elements $a$ of order 8, and for either of the 2 elements $b$, the resulting pair $(a,b)$ will have order $\\operatorname{lcm}(8, \\operatorname{ord}(b)) = 8$.\nTherefore, the total number of elements of order 8 is $N = \\phi(8) \\times |C_2| = 4 \\times 2 = 8$.\nThere are 8 elements of order 8 in $(\\mathbb{Z}/32\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "3088559"}]}
