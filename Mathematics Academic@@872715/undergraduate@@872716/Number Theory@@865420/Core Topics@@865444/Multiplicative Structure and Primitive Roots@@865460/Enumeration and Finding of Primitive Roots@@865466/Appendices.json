Use fundamental facts from elementary number theory: the definition of multiplicative order, Fermat's Little Theorem, and divisibility properties of exponents. Begin by recalling that the multiplicative order of an integer $a$ modulo a prime $p$ (with $p \\nmid a$) is the least positive integer $d$ such that $a^{d} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, and that by Fermat's Little Theorem one always has $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. Argue from these bases why, to determine whether $2$ is a primitive root modulo $13$ (that is, whether its multiplicative order equals $12$), it suffices to compute the residues of $2^{12/2}$ and $2^{12/3}$ modulo $13$. Then carry out these computations and conclude the exact value of the multiplicative order of $2$ modulo $13$. Present the final answer as a single integer with no units.", "solution": "The problem asks for two main tasks: first, to provide a theoretical justification for a specific method to test if an integer is a primitive root modulo a prime, and second, to apply this method to find the multiplicative order of $2$ modulo $13$.\n\nLet $p=13$, a prime number, and let $a=2$. We are interested in the multiplicative order of $a$ modulo $p$, denoted as $\\operatorname{ord}_{p}(a)$ or $\\operatorname{ord}_{13}(2)$. By definition, this is the smallest positive integer $d$ such that $a^d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nAccording to Fermat's Little Theorem, for any integer $a$ not divisible by the prime $p$, we have $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. In our case, since $13 \\nmid 2$, we have $2^{13-1} \\equiv 2^{12} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$.\n\nA fundamental property of the multiplicative order is that if $a^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ for some positive integer $k$, then the order $d = \\operatorname{ord}_{p}(a)$ must divide $k$. Applying this property to our result from Fermat's Little Theorem, we conclude that $\\operatorname{ord}_{13}(2)$ must be a divisor of $12$. The set of positive divisors of $12$ is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\\}$. The order of $2$ modulo $13$ must be one of these values.\n\nAn integer $a$ is a primitive root modulo $p$ if its order is the maximum possible value, which is $\\phi(p) = p-1$. For $p=13$, this value is $12$. To determine if $2$ is a primitive root modulo $13$, we need to check if $\\operatorname{ord}_{13}(2) = 12$. This means we must verify that $2^d \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$ for all proper divisors of $12$, i.e., for $d \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6\\}$.\n\nThe problem proposes a more efficient check. This is a specific application of a general theorem for testing primitive roots. The theorem states that an element $a$ in $(\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is a primitive root (i.e., $\\operatorname{ord}_n(a) = \\phi(n)$) if and only if $a^{\\phi(n)/q} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$ for every distinct prime factor $q$ of $\\phi(n)$.\n\nIn our case, $n=13$, so $\\phi(13) = 12$. The prime factorization of $12$ is $12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$. The distinct prime factors of $12$ are $2$ and $3$. Thus, according to the theorem, $\\operatorname{ord}_{13}(2) = 12$ if and only if $2^{12/2} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$ and $2^{12/3} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$. That is, we must check $2^6$ and $2^4$.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows: Let $d = \\operatorname{ord}_{13}(2)$. We know $d \\mid 12$. If $d  12$, then $d$ must be a proper divisor of $12$. For any proper divisor $d$ of $12$, the fraction $12/d$ must be divisible by at least one prime factor of $12$. This means that if $d$ is a proper divisor of $12$, then $d$ must divide at least one of the maximal proper divisors of $12$. The maximal proper divisors are formed by dividing $12$ by its prime factors, giving $12/2 = 6$ and $12/3 = 4$. Any proper divisor of $12$ (i.e., $1, 2, 3, 4, 6$) is a divisor of either $4$ or $6$.\nIf $\\operatorname{ord}_{13}(2) = d  12$, then $d$ must divide $4$ or $d$ must divide $6$.\nIf $d \\mid 4$, then by the properties of order, $2^4 = 2^{d \\cdot (4/d)} = (2^d)^{4/d} \\equiv 1^{4/d} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$.\nIf $d \\mid 6$, then similarly, $2^6 = 2^{d \\cdot (6/d)} = (2^d)^{6/d} \\equiv 1^{6/d} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$.\nTherefore, if the order of $2$ were a proper divisor of $12$, it must be true that either $2^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$ or $2^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$.\nThe contrapositive of this statement is that if $2^4 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$ AND $2^6 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$, then the order cannot be a proper divisor of $12$. Since we already know the order must be a divisor of $12$, the only remaining possibility is that the order is $12$ itself. This validates the method.\n\nNow, we perform the computations.\nFirst, we compute $2^4 \\pmod{13}$:\n$$2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{13}$$\n$$2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{13}$$\n$$2^3 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{13}$$\n$$2^4 \\equiv 16 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{13}$$\nSince $2^4 \\equiv 3 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$, the order of $2$ cannot be $1, 2,$ or $4$.\n\nNext, we compute $2^6 \\pmod{13}$. We can use the previous result:\n$$2^6 = 2^4 \\cdot 2^2 \\equiv 3 \\cdot 4 = 12 \\pmod{13}$$\nAlternatively, $12 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}$.\nSince $2^6 \\equiv 12 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$, the order of $2$ cannot be $1, 2, 3,$ or $6$.\n\nWe have shown that $2^4 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$ and $2^6 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$. Based on our argument, this eliminates all proper divisors of $12$ as possibilities for $\\operatorname{ord}_{13}(2)$. The only remaining possibility from the set of divisors of $12$ is $12$ itself.\n\nTherefore, the multiplicative order of $2$ modulo $13$ is $12$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "3084752"}, {"introduction": "While primitive roots exist for all prime moduli, this is not true for all composite numbers.
