The derivation must be based solely on the definition of congruence and the Euclidean division algorithm. Finally, the derived method must be applied to a specific numerical example.\n\n### Derivation of the Method\n\nLet $n$ be a fixed positive integer and let $a, b$ be integers such that $ab$. We wish to find the unique integer $r$ such that $a-b \\equiv r \\pmod{n}$ and $0 \\le r \\le n-1$. This integer $r$ is the canonical representative of $(a-b)$ modulo $n$.\n\nThe two foundational principles provided are:\n1.  **Definition of Congruence**: $x \\equiv y \\pmod{n}$ if and only if $n$ divides $(x-y)$, which we denote as $n | (x-y)$. This is equivalent to stating that $x-y=kn$ for some integer $k$.\n2.  **Euclidean Division Algorithm**: For any integer $x$ and a positive integer $n$, there exist unique integers $q$ (quotient) and $r$ (remainder) such that $x = qn+r$ and $0 \\le r \\le n-1$. The remainder $r$ is often denoted as $x \\pmod{n}$.\n\nOur goal is to find the canonical representative of $a-b$. A direct computation of $a-b$ yields a negative number because $ab$. The core of the task is to find a congruent non-negative number whose canonical representative can be computed without negative intermediate steps.\n\n**Step 1: Reduction using modular arithmetic**\n\nFirst, we establish that we can work with the remainders of $a$ and $b$ modulo $n$.\nBy the Euclidean division algorithm, we can find unique integers $q_a, r_a, q_b, r_b$ such that:\n$a = q_a n + r_a$, with $0 \\le r_a  n$.\n$b = q_b n + r_b$, with $0 \\le r_b  n$.\n\nBy definition, $a \\equiv r_a \\pmod{n}$ and $b \\equiv r_b \\pmod{n}$.\nNow consider the difference $a-b$:\n$$a-b = (q_a n + r_a) - (q_b n + r_b) = (q_a - q_b)n + (r_a - r_b)$$\nLet $k = q_a - q_b$, which is an integer. Then $(a-b) - (r_a-r_b) = kn$.\nBy the definition of congruence, this means $n | ((a-b)-(r_a-r_b))$, and therefore:\n$$a-b \\equiv r_a - r_b \\pmod{n}$$\nThis shows that the problem of finding the canonical representative of $a-b$ is equivalent to finding the canonical representative of $r_a - r_b$. The values $r_a$ and $r_b$ are non-negative, which is a first step towards fulfilling the problem's constraint.\n\n**Step 2: Handling the difference of remainders**\n\nThe difference $r_a - r_b$ can still be negative if $r_a  r_b$. Since $0 \\le r_a  n$ and $0 \\le r_b  n$, the range of this difference is $-(n-1) \\le r_a - r_b \\le n-1$.\n\nWe analyze two cases:\n\n**Case A: $r_a \\ge r_b$**\nIn this case, the difference $d = r_a - r_b$ is non-negative. Since $r_a  n$ and $r_b \\ge 0$, we have $0 \\le r_a - r_b  n$.\nThe value $d$ is already in the range $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$. Since $d \\equiv r_a - r_b \\pmod{n}$ (because their difference is $0$), $d$ is the canonical representative we seek. The computation involves only non-negative numbers $r_a$, $r_b$, and their difference $d$.\n\n**Case B: $r_a  r_b$**\nIn this case, the difference $r_a - r_b$ is negative. To avoid a negative intermediate quantity, we must find an equivalent non-negative number before computing the final remainder.\nWe rely on a fundamental property of congruences: adding a multiple of the modulus $n$ does not change the residue class. Let's prove this from the definition:\nWe want to show that for any integer $x$, $x \\equiv x+kn \\pmod{n}$ for any integer $k$.\nThe difference is $(x+kn) - x = kn$. Since $k$ is an integer, $n | kn$. By the definition of congruence, $x+kn \\equiv x \\pmod{n}$.\n\nApplying this property to $r_a-r_b$, we have:\n$$r_a - r_b \\equiv (r_a - r_b) + n \\pmod{n}$$\nLet's analyze the quantity $d' = (r_a-r_b)+n$.\nSince $r_a  r_b$, we know $r_a-r_b \\le -1$. Also, $r_a \\ge 0$ and $r_b \\le n-1$, so $r_a-r_b \\ge 0-(n-1) = -(n-1)$.\nThus, $-(n-1) \\le r_a-r_b \\le -1$.\nAdding $n$ to all parts of the inequality gives:\n$$-(n-1)+n \\le (r_a-r_b)+n \\le -1+n$$\n$$1 \\le d' \\le n-1$$\nThis shows that $d' = (r_a-r_b)+n$ is already in the range for a canonical representative. So, $d'$ is the answer.\n\nTo meet the constraint of no negative intermediate quantities, we must compute $d'$ without first calculating the negative value $r_a-r_b$. We can rearrange the expression as:\n$$d' = (r_a + n) - r_b$$\nIn this form, the computation proceeds as follows:\n1.  Calculate $r_a+n$. Since $r_a \\ge 0$ and $n0$, this is a positive integer.\n2.  Calculate $(r_a+n) - r_b$. Since $r_a \\ge 0$ and $r_b  n$, we have $r_a+n  r_b$. Therefore, this difference is a positive integer.\n\nThis procedure yields the correct canonical representative while ensuring all intermediate quantities ($r_a, r_b, r_a+n$, and the final result) are non-negative.\n\n**Summary of the Derived Method**\nTo compute $(a-b) \\pmod{n}$ and obtain the canonical representative in $\\{0, \\dots, n-1\\}$ without negative intermediates:\n1.  Use the Euclidean division algorithm to find $r_a = a \\pmod{n}$ and $r_b = b \\pmod{n}$.\n2.  Compare $r_a$ and $r_b$.\n3.  If $r_a \\ge r_b$, the result is $r_a - r_b$.\n4.  If $r_a  r_b$, the result is $(r_a+n) - r_b$.\n\nThis method is fully justified by the provided first principles and adheres to all constraints.\n\n### Application to the Specific Problem\n\nWe are asked to compute $(a-b) \\pmod{n}$ for $a=12345$, $b=67890$, and $n=97$. We apply the derived method.\n\n**Step 1: Find the remainders $r_a$ and $r_b$.**\nFor $a=12345$ and $n=97$:\nThe Euclidean division of $12345$ by $97$ gives:\n$$12345 = 127 \\times 97 + 26$$\nHence, $r_a = 12345 \\pmod{97} = 26$. This is a non-negative quantity.\n\nFor $b=67890$ and $n=97$:\nThe Euclidean division of $67890$ by $97$ gives:\n$$67890 = 699 \\times 97 + 87$$\nHence, $r_b = 67890 \\pmod{97} = 87$. This is a non-negative quantity.\n\n**Step 2: Compare $r_a$ and $r_b$.**\nWe have $r_a=26$ and $r_b=87$. Clearly, $r_a  r_b$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the result.**\nSince $r_a  r_b$, we use the formula for Case B: the result is $(r_a+n)-r_b$.\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ (26 + 97) - 87 $$\nThe intermediate sum is $26+97 = 123$. This quantity is non-negative.\nThe final subtraction is $123 - 87$.\n$$ 123 - 87 = 36 $$\nThe final result is $36$. This result is in the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 96\\}$, so it is the canonical representative. All intermediate steps involved non-negative quantities.\nTherefore, $(12345 - 67890) \\pmod{97} = 36$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{36}\n$$", "id": "3087232"}, {"introduction": "Unlike arithmetic with real numbers, the familiar cancellation law does not always hold in modular systems.

The modulus is given as $n = 84$. The conditions are:\n$1.$ $1  a  n$\n$2.$ $1 \\leq x  y  n$\n$3.$ $a x \\equiv a y \\pmod{n}$\n$4.$ $x \\not\\equiv y \\pmod{n}$\n\nThe final triple $(a,x,y)$ must be chosen by first minimizing $a$, then for that value of $a$, minimizing $x$, and finally for that pair $(a,x)$, minimizing $y$.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the third condition, $a x \\equiv a y \\pmod{n}$, which means that $n$ divides the difference $ax - ay$. This can be written as $n | (ax - ay)$, or equivalently, $n | a(y-x)$.\n\nThe fourth condition, $x \\not\\equiv y \\pmod{n}$, means that $n$ does not divide the difference $y-x$. This is guaranteed by the second condition, $1 \\leq x  y  n$, which implies $0  y-x  n-1$. Since $y-x$ is a positive integer strictly less than $n$, it cannot be a multiple of $n$.\n\nWe are looking for a situation where $n$ divides the product $a(y-x)$, but $n$ does not divide the factor $(y-x)$. This can only happen if $a$ shares common factors with $n$. Specifically, the property of cancellation in modular arithmetic states that if $ax \\equiv ay \\pmod{n}$ and $\\gcd(a, n) = 1$, then one can \"cancel\" $a$ to get $x \\equiv y \\pmod{n}$. The problem asks for a scenario where this cancellation fails, which necessitates that $a$ is not a unit modulo $n$. Based on the provided definitions, this means $a$ must be a zero divisor, i.e., $\\gcd(a, n) \\neq 1$. Since $1  a  n$, this is equivalent to $\\gcd(a, n)  1$.\n\nOur first step is to find the minimum possible value for $a$. The constraint is $1  a  84$ and $\\gcd(a, 84)  1$. To find the smallest such $a$, we can test integers starting from $2$.\nThe prime factorization of $n=84$ is $84 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7$.\nThe smallest integer $a  1$ that shares a factor with $84$ is the smallest prime factor of $84$, which is $2$. Thus, the least possible value for $a$ is $2$.\nSo, we fix $a=2$.\n\nNow we substitute $a=2$ into the congruence $ax \\equiv ay \\pmod{n}$. This gives:\n$2x \\equiv 2y \\pmod{84}$\nBy the definition of congruence, this means $84 | (2y - 2x)$, or $84 | 2(y-x)$.\nDividing the divisor and the dividend by their common factor of $2$, we get an equivalent statement:\n$\\frac{84}{2} | \\frac{2(y-x)}{2}$\n$42 | (y-x)$\n\nThis means that the difference $y-x$ must be a multiple of $42$. Let $y-x = 42k$ for some integer $k$.\nFrom the constraint $1 \\leq x  y  84$, we can deduce the possible range for $y-x$. The minimum value is when $y=x+1$, giving $y-x=1$. The maximum value is bounded by $y-x  84-1 = 83$. So, $1 \\leq y-x \\leq 83$.\nThe multiples of $42$ in this range are $42 \\times 1 = 42$ and $42 \\times 2 = 84$. Since $y-x \\leq 83$, the only possibility is $y-x = 42$.\n\nWe have established that for the minimal $a=2$, we must have $y-x=42$, or $y = x+42$.\nOur next step is to find the minimal value of $x$. The constraint on $x$ is $1 \\leq x  n$, which is $1 \\leq x  84$. The smallest possible integer value for $x$ is $x=1$.\n\nLet's check if $x=1$ is a valid choice. If $x=1$, then $y = 1+42 = 43$. We must verify that this pair $(x,y)=(1,43)$ satisfies the condition $1 \\leq x  y  n$.\n$1 \\leq 1  43  84$. This is true.\nSo, for the minimum $a=2$, the minimum $x$ is $1$.\n\nFinally, we need to find the minimum value of $y$ for the pair $(a,x)=(2,1)$. We already derived that for $a=2$, the condition $y-x=42$ must hold. With $x=1$, this uniquely determines $y=43$. Any other choice for $y$ would involve a larger multiple of $42$ for $y-x$, such as $y-x=84$, which implies $y=85$, violating $y84$. Therefore, $y=43$ is the least possible and only value for this choice of $a$ and $x$.\n\nThe resulting triple is $(a,x,y) = (2,1,43)$. Let's verify all conditions one last time:\n- $n=84$.\n- $a=2$: $1  2  84$. (Condition 1 holds)\n- $x=1, y=43$: $1 \\leq 1  43  84$.

This is equivalent to the condition that the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $36$ is $1$, i.e., $\\text{gcd}(a, 36) = 1$.\n\nThe prime factorization of $36$ is $36 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2$.

We need to list all such integers $a$ in the range $1 \\leq a  36$.\n\nLet's enumerate the integers from $1$ to $35$ and exclude those divisible by $2$ or $3$:\n- The integers are: $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35$.\n- Exclude multiples of $2$: all even numbers.

The operation is modular multiplication. We verify the four group axioms.\n\n(a) **Closure**:\nLet $[a] \\in U$ and $[b] \\in U$. By definition, this means $\\text{gcd}(a, 36) = 1$ and $\\text{gcd}(b, 36) = 1$. We need to show that their product, $[a][b] = [ab]$, is also in $U$. This is equivalent to showing that $\\text{gcd}(ab, 36) = 1$.\nThe condition $\\text{gcd}(a, 36) = 1$ implies that $a$ shares no prime factors with $36$. The prime factors of $36$ are $2$ and $3$. Thus, $2 \\nmid a$ and $3 \\nmid a$.\nSimilarly, $\\text{gcd}(b, 36) = 1$ implies $2 \\nmid b$ and $3 \\nmid b$.\nSince primality is a property of integers, if $2$ does not divide $a$ and $2$ does not divide $b$, then $2$ cannot divide their product $ab$. The same logic applies to the prime factor $3$.\nTherefore, $ab$ shares no prime factors with $36$, which means $\\text{gcd}(ab, 36) = 1$.\nThis implies that $[ab] \\in U$, so the set $U$ is closed under modular multiplication.\n\n(b) **Associativity**:\nLet $[a], [b], [c] \\in U$. We need to show that $([a][b])[c] = [a]([b][c])$.\nBy the definition of modular multiplication:\n$$ ([a][b])[c] = [a \\cdot b][c] = [(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c] $$\nAnd:\n$$ [a]([b][c]) = [a][b \\cdot c] = [a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)] $$\nThe multiplication of integers is associative, so $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$.\nTherefore, $[(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c] = [a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)]$, which proves associativity. This property is inherited from the ring of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n(c) **Identity**:\nWe need to find an element $[e] \\in U$ such that for any $[a] \\in U$, we have $[a][e] = [e][a] = [a]$.\nConsider the residue class $[1]$. First, we check if $[1] \\in U$. Since $\\text{gcd}(1, 36) = 1$, $[1]$ is indeed in $U$.\nFor any $[a] \\in U$, we have:\n$$ [a][1] = [a \\cdot 1] = [a] $$\n$$ [1][a] = [1 \\cdot a] = [a] $$\nThus, $[1]$ is the identity element of $U$.\n\n(d) **Inverses**:\nFor each element $[a] \\in U$, we must show there exists an element $[b] \\in U$ such that $[a][b] = [b][a] = [1]$.\nLet $[a] \\in U$. This means $\\text{gcd}(a, 36) = 1$. By Bézout's identity, since the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $36$ is $1$, there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that:\n$$ ax + 36y = 1 $$\nConsidering this equation modulo $36$, the term $36y$ is congruent to $0$:\n$$ ax + 36y \\equiv 1 \\pmod{36} \\implies ax \\equiv 1 \\pmod{36} $$\nThis means the residue class $[x]$ is the multiplicative inverse of $[a]$. Let $[b] = [x]$. So, $[a][b] = [1]$. By commutativity of multiplication, $[b][a] = [1]$ as well.\nNow, we must show that this inverse element $[b]$ is also in $U$. The equation $ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod{36}$ implies that $ab - 1 = 36k$ for some integer $k$. Rearranging gives $ab - 36k = 1$. Any common divisor of $b$ and $36$ must divide the linear combination $ab - 36k$. Therefore, any common divisor must divide $1$. The only positive integer that divides $1$ is $1$ itself. Thus, $\\text{gcd}(b, 36) = 1$.\nThis confirms that $[b] \\in U$. Hence, every element in $U$ has a multiplicative inverse in $U$.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of the Product of All Elements**\n\nWe want to compute the product $P = \\prod_{[a] \\in \\mathbb{Z}/36\\mathbb{Z}^{\\times}} [a]$ modulo $36$.\n$$ P = [1 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 23 \\cdot 25 \\cdot 29 \\cdot 31 \\cdot 35] $$\nThe strategy is to pair each element with its multiplicative inverse. The product of such a pair is $[1]$. The overall product $P$ will then be the product of the elements that are their own inverses.\nAn element $[x]$ is its own inverse if $[x]^2 = [x^2] = [1]$, which means $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{36}$.\nThis congruence is equivalent to the system of congruences:\n$$ \\begin{cases} x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\\\ x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9} \\end{cases} $$\nAll elements $[x] \\in \\mathbb{Z}/36\\mathbb{Z}^{\\times}$ have $\\text{gcd}(x, 36) = 1$, which implies $x$ must be odd. If $x$ is odd, let $x = 2k+1$ for some integer $k$. Then $x^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2+4k+1 = 4k(k+1)+1$. Since either $k$ or $k+1$ is even, $k(k+1)$ is even, so $4k(k+1)$ is a multiple of $8$. Thus, $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$, which implies $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. So, all elements of $\\mathbb{Z}/36\\mathbb{Z}^{\\times}$ satisfy the first congruence.\n\nWe are left with solving $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$ for $x \\in \\{1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29, 31, 35\\}$.\nThe congruence $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$ has solutions $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$ and $x \\equiv 8 \\pmod 9$ (or $x \\equiv -1 \\pmod 9$).\nLet's find which elements of our set satisfy these conditions:\n-   Elements satisfying $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$:\n    -   $1$: $1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$.\n    -   $19$: $19 = 2 \\cdot 9 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 9$.\n-   Elements satisfying $x \\equiv 8 \\pmod 9$:\n    -   $17$: $17 = 1 \\cdot 9 + 8 \\equiv 8 \\pmod 9$.\n    -   $35$: $35 = 3 \\cdot 9 + 8 \\equiv 8 \\pmod 9$.\n\nSo, the elements that are their own inverses are $\\{[1], [17], [19], [35]\\}$.\nThe other $12-4=8$ elements are paired up with their distinct inverses. For example, $[5][29] = [145] = [4 \\cdot 36 + 1] = [1]$, so $([5], [29])$ is such a pair. The product of all such pairs is $[1]$.\nTherefore, the total product $P$ is the product of the self-inverse elements:\n$$ P \\equiv 1 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 35 \\pmod{36} $$\nWe compute this product modulo $36$:\n-   Note that $35 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{36}$.\n-   Let's compute $17 \\cdot 19$. We can write this as $(18-1)(18+1) = 18^2 - 1$. Since $36 = 2 \\cdot 18$, $18^2 = 18 \\cdot ( \\frac{36}{2}) = 9 \\cdot 36 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{36}$.\n-   So, $17 \\cdot 19 \\equiv 0 - 1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{36}$.\n-   Substituting these back into the product for $P$:\n$$ P \\equiv 1 \\cdot (17 \\cdot 19) \\cdot 35 \\equiv 1 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-1) \\pmod{36} $$\n$$ P \\equiv 1 \\pmod{36} $$\nThe product of all elements of $\\mathbb{Z}/36\\mathbb{Z}^{\\times}$ is $[1]$. The unique integer representative in the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 35\\}$ is $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3087246"}]}
