Both coefficients are integers, i.e., $A, B \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the fundamental invariants of this model. The invariant $c_4$ and the discriminant $\\Delta$ for a short Weierstrass model are given by the formulas:\n$$c_4 = -48A$$\n$$\\Delta = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2)$$\n\nSubstituting the values $A = -1$ and $B = 0$:\n$$c_4 = -48(-1) = 48$$\n$$\\Delta = -16(4(-1)^3 + 27(0)^2) = -16(-4) = 64$$\n\nThe primes $p$ of bad reduction for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are precisely the prime divisors of the discriminant of a minimal Weierstrass model, denoted $\\Delta_{\\min}$. A Weierstrass model with integer coefficients is minimal at a prime $p$ if the $p$-adic valuation of its discriminant, $v_p(\\Delta)$, is the smallest possible among all isomorphic models over $\\mathbb{Q}$ which have integer coefficients. A standard criterion for the minimality of a short Weierstrass model $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$ (with $A, B \\in \\mathbb{Z}$) at a prime $p$ is that $v_p(\\Delta) < 12$.\n\nLet us apply this criterion to our model with $\\Delta = 64 = 2^6$.\nFor any prime $p \\neq 2$, the $p$-adic valuation of the discriminant is $v_p(\\Delta) = v_p(2^6) = 0$. Since $0 < 12$, the model is minimal at all primes $p \\neq 2$. As $v_p(\\Delta_{\\min})=0$ for these primes, the curve $E$ has good reduction at all primes $p \\neq 2$.\n\nFor the prime $p=2$, the $2$-adic valuation of the discriminant is $v_2(\\Delta) = v_2(64) = v_2(2^6) = 6$. Since $6 < 12$, the given model is also minimal at $p=2$.\nSince the model is minimal at all primes $p$, it is a global minimal Weierstrass model.\nTherefore, the minimal discriminant is $\\Delta_{\\min} = \\Delta = 64$.\n\nThe primes of bad reduction are the prime divisors of $\\Delta_{\\min} = 64$. The only prime divisor of $64$ is $p=2$. Thus, $p=2$ is the unique bad prime. The valuation of the minimal discriminant at this prime is $v_2(\\Delta_{\\min}) = 6$.\n\nNext, we classify the type of reduction at $p=2$ using the Kodaira–Néron classification. The first step is to distinguish between multiplicative and additive reduction. This is determined by the $p$-adic valuation of the $j$-invariant of the curve. The $j$-invariant is related to the invariants $c_4$ and $\\Delta$ by the formula:\n$$j = \\frac{c_4^3}{\\Delta}$$\nUsing our computed values $c_4 = 48$ and $\\Delta = 64$:\n$$j = \\frac{48^3}{64} = \\frac{(3 \\times 16)^3}{64} = \\frac{3^3 \\times (2^4)^3}{2^6} = \\frac{3^3 \\times 2^{12}}{2^6} = 3^3 \\times 2^6 = 27 \\times 64 = 1728$$\nThe $2$-adic valuation of the $j$-invariant is $v_2(j) = v_2(1728) = v_2(2^6 \\cdot 3^3) = 6$.\n\nThe criterion for the type of reduction is:\n- If $v_p(j) < 0$, the reduction is multiplicative (type $I_\\nu$).\n- If $v_p(j) \\geq 0$ and $v_p(\\Delta) > 0$, the reduction is additive (type $II, III, IV, I_\\nu^*$, etc.).\nSince $v_2(j) = 6 \\geq 0$ and $v_2(\\Delta) = 6 > 0$, the curve $E$ has additive reduction at $p=2$.\n\nTo confirm and further classify the reduction, we analyze the reduced curve $\\tilde{E}$ modulo $p=2$. The equation becomes:\n$$y^2 \\equiv x^3 - x \\pmod 2$$\n$$y^2 \\equiv x^3 + x \\pmod 2$$\n$$y^2 \\equiv x(x^2+1) \\pmod 2$$\n$$y^2 \\equiv x(x+1)^2 \\pmod 2$$\nThe polynomial $x(x+1)^2$ has roots $x=0$ (multiplicity $1$) and $x=1$ (multiplicity $2$). A multiple root indicates that the reduced curve is singular. The singular point is $(x_0, y_0) = (1, 0) \\pmod 2$.\nTo analyze the nature of the singularity, we translate the singular point to the origin. Let $x' = x-1$ (so $x = x'+1$) and $y' = y$. The equation becomes:\n$$(y')^2 = (x'+1)^3 - (x'+1) = (x'^3 + 3x'^2 + 3x' + 1) - (x' + 1) = x'^3 + 3x'^2 + 2x'$$\nReducing modulo $2$:\n$$(y')^2 \\equiv x'^3 + x'^2 \\pmod 2$$\nThe lowest degree terms are $(y')^2 - x'^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. Over a field of characteristic $2$, this is equivalent to $(y')^2 + (x')^2 \\equiv (y'+x')^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. This equation defines a single tangent line, $y' + x' \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$, at the singular point. A singularity with a single tangent line is a cusp. A cuspidal singularity corresponds to additive reduction, which confirms our conclusion from the $j$-invariant.\n\nThe specific Kodaira–Néron type for additive reduction is determined by the valuations of the invariants. According to Tate's algorithm (or its derived classification tables), for a prime $p$, the additive reduction type $I_k^*$ corresponds to a valuation of the minimal discriminant $v_p(\\Delta_{\\min}) = k+6$.\nIn our case, for $p=2$, we have $v_2(\\Delta_{\\min}) = 6$. Setting this equal to $k+6$ gives $k=0$. Therefore, the reduction type at $p=2$ is $I_0^*$.\n\nThe problem asks for the unique bad prime $p$ and the valuation $v_p(\\Delta_{\\min})$.

In this equation, the lowest degree is $2$. The equation for the tangent cone is:\n$$Y^{2} \\equiv 3X^{2} \\pmod{5}$$\nThis can be written as $Y^{2} - 3X^{2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$. A singularity is a node (corresponding to multiplicative reduction) if this equation factors into two distinct linear forms over the algebraic closure of the field, $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_{5}}$. The equation factors if and only if $3$ is a quadratic residue modulo $5$. The non-zero quadratic residues in $\\mathbb{F}_{5}$ are $1^{2} \\equiv 1$ and $2^{2} \\equiv 4$. Since $3$ is not a quadratic residue in $\\mathbb{F}_{5}$, the tangent lines are not defined over $\\mathbb{F}_{5}$. However, over $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_{5}}$, we can find an element $\\sqrt{3}$ such that $(\\sqrt{3})^{2} = 3$. Then the equation for the tangent cone factors as:\n$$(Y - \\sqrt{3}X)(Y + \\sqrt{3}X) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$$\nThis corresponds to two distinct tangent lines, $Y = \\sqrt{3}X$ and $Y = -\\sqrt{3}X$. Since the characteristic of the field is $5 \\neq 2$, $\\sqrt{3}$ is not equal to $-\\sqrt{3}$. The existence of two distinct tangent lines at the singular point confirms that the singularity is a node. This type of singular cubic is called a nodal cubic, which corresponds to multiplicative reduction. This direct analysis confirms our earlier conclusion based on the valuations of the invariants.\n\nThe final task is to provide the value of $v_{5}(\\Delta)$. As computed above, this value is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3089617"}]}
