Computation of $2P$**\n\nThe point $2P$ is defined as the sum $P+P$. To compute this sum, we must use the tangent line method. The group law states that if the tangent line to the curve at $P$ intersects the curve at a third point $R'$, then $P+P = -R'$, where $-R'$ is the reflection of $R'$ across the $x$-axis. If $R'=(x', y')$, then $-R' = (x', -y')$.\n\nFirst, we find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at $P=(0,0)$.

The equation of the vertical line passing through $(0,0)$ is $x=0$.\n\nNext, we find the intersection points of this tangent line, $x=0$, with the elliptic curve $E$. We substitute $x=0$ into the curve's equation:\n$$\ny^{2} = (0)^{3}+0 \\implies y^{2} = 0\n$$\nThis equation has a double root at $y=0$. This confirms that the line $x=0$ is indeed tangent to the curve at the point $(0,0)$.\n\nIn the projective plane where elliptic curves are defined, a vertical line $x=c$ intersects the curve at two finite points $(c, y_c)$ and $(c, -y_c)$ and the point at infinity, $\\mathcal{O}$. When the line is tangent, two of these intersection points coincide. In our case, the line $x=0$ is tangent to the curve at $P=(0,0)$.

Therefore, the three intersection points of the line $x=0$ and the curve $E$ are $P=(0,0)$ (with multiplicity two) and the point at infinity, $\\mathcal{O}$.\n\nAccording to the group law for adding a point to itself, the third intersection point is $R' = \\mathcal{O}$. The sum $2P$ is the inverse of this point:\n$$\n2P = -R' = -\\mathcal{O}\n$$\nThe inverse of the point at infinity is the point at infinity itself.
