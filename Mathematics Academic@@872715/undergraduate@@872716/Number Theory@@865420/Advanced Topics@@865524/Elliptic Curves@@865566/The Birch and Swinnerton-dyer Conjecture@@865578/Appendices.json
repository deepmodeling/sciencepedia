The identity element is the point at infinity, $\\mathcal{O}$. The sum of three collinear points $P_1, P_2, P_3$ on the curve is the identity, i.e., $P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = \\mathcal{O}$. The point $P=(2,1)$ is on the curve $E: y^2=x^3-4x+1$ because $1^2 = 2^3 - 4(2) + 1$, which is $1 = 1$.\n\n**Part 1: Verification of the Inverse**\nThe inverse of a point $P = (x_p, y_p)$ is the point $-P$ such that $P + (-P) = \\mathcal{O}$. Geometrically, $-P$ is the reflection of $P$ across the x-axis. For a vertical line $x=x_p$ passing through $P$, it intersects the curve at two affine points, $(x_p, y_p)$ and $(x_p, -y_p)$, and at the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$. By the group law, $P + (x_p, -y_p) + \\mathcal{O} = \\mathcal{O}$, which implies $(x_p, -y_p)$ is the inverse of $P$.\nGiven $P=(2, 1)$, its inverse is $-P = (2, -1)$. This verifies the first part of the problem statement.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of $2P$**\nTo compute $2P = P+P$, we use the tangent line to the curve at $P$. The equation of the curve is $F(x,y) = y^2 - x^3 + 4x - 1 = 0$. We find the slope of the tangent line at $P=(2,1)$ using implicit differentiation:\n$$2y \\frac{dy}{dx} - 3x^2 + 4 = 0 \\implies \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{3x^2 - 4}{2y}$$\nAt the point $P=(2, 1)$, the slope $m$ is:\n$$m = \\frac{3(2)^2 - 4}{2(1)} = \\frac{3(4) - 4}{2} = \\frac{12 - 4}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4$$\nThe equation of the tangent line at $P$ is $y - 1 = 4(x - 2)$, which simplifies to $y = 4x - 7$.\nNext, we find the third intersection point of this tangent line with the curve by substituting $y$ into the curve equation:\n$$(4x - 7)^2 = x^3 - 4x + 1$$\n$$16x^2 - 56x + 49 = x^3 - 4x + 1$$\n$$0 = x^3 - 16x^2 + 52x - 48$$\nSince the line is tangent at $P=(2, 1)$, the $x$-coordinate $x=2$ must be a root of this cubic with multiplicity at least $2$. Let the three roots be $x_1, x_2, x_3$. From Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = -(-16)/1 = 16$.\nWith $x_1=2$ and $x_2=2$, we find the third root $x_3$:\n$$2 + 2 + x_3 = 16 \\implies x_3 = 12$$\nLet the third intersection point be $R=(x_R, y_R)$. We have $x_R=12$. To find $y_R$, we use the line equation:\n$$y_R = 4(12) - 7 = 48 - 7 = 41$$\nSo, the third point of intersection is $R=(12, 41)$.\nAccording to the group law, $P + P + R = \\mathcal{O}$, which means $2P + R = \\mathcal{O}$.

The only prime dividing $\\Delta$ is $p=11$, which is the sole prime of bad reduction.\n\nTo determine the Kodaira type at $p=11$, we find that the singular point on the reduced curve is $(5,5)$ and has two distinct tangent directions, making it a node. This corresponds to multiplicative reduction of type $I_n$. The value of $n$ is the valuation of the discriminant at the prime, $n=v_{11}(\\Delta) = v_{11}(-11^5) = 5$. The Kodaira type is $I_5$, and the Tamagawa number for type $I_n$ is $c_p=n$.

This implies $|T|$ is either $1$ or $5$.\nWe can test for rational points of finite order. The integer point $P=(5,5)$ satisfies the curve equation: $5^2+5 = 30$ and $5^3-5^2-10(5)-20 = 125-25-50-20=30$.
