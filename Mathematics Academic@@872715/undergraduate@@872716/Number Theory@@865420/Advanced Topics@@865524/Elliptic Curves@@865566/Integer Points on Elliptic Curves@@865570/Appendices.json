The equation $y^2 = x^3 - 25x$ is a valid short Weierstrass equation. All definitions and concepts (rational point, torsion point, point at infinity) are standard in this field.\n2.  **Well-Posedness and Consistency**: I shall verify the provided data.\n    -   Check if point $P$ lies on the curve $E$.\n        Left side: $y^2 = \\left(\\frac{75}{8}\\right)^2 = \\frac{5625}{64}$.\n        Right side: $x^3 - 25x = \\left(\\frac{25}{4}\\right)^3 - 25\\left(\\frac{25}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15625}{64} - \\frac{625}{4} = \\frac{15625 - 625 \\cdot 16}{64} = \\frac{15625 - 10000}{64} = \\frac{5625}{64}$.\n        Since the left and right sides are equal, the point $P$ does indeed lie on the curve $E(\\mathbb{Q})$.\n    -   Check the solutions for $y=0$.\n        $y^2 = 0 \\implies x^3 - 25x = 0 \\implies x(x^2 - 25) = 0 \\implies x(x-5)(x+5) = 0$.\n        The solutions are $x=0$, $x=5$, and $x=-5$. The corresponding points on the curve are $(0,0)$, $(5,0)$, and $(-5,0)$. This is correct.\n    -   These points are the points of order $2$, as the tangent line at each is vertical, intersecting the curve only at the point itself (with multiplicity $2$) and the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$. Thus, they are torsion points.\n\nThe problem statement is internally consistent, mathematically sound, and well-posed. No flaws are detected.\n\n### **Solution Derivation**\nThe problem requires us to analyze the properties of the elliptic curve $E: y^2 = x^3 - 25x$ and the specific point $P = \\left(\\frac{25}{4}, \\frac{75}{8}\\right)$.\n\n**1. Analysis of Torsion Points**\nThe problem correctly identifies the points of order $2$: $T_1 = (0,0)$, $T_2 = (5,0)$, and $T_3 = (-5,0)$. Together with the identity element $\\mathcal{O}$, these form a subgroup of the torsion subgroup $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{tors}$, namely $\\{\\mathcal{O}, T_1, T_2, T_3\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nTo determine if there are other torsion points and to analyze the nature of point $P$, we employ the Lutz-Nagell Theorem. For an elliptic curve given by $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$ with integer coefficients $A, B \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the theorem states:\nIf $(x,y)$ is a rational torsion point in $E(\\mathbb{Q})$, then its coordinates $x$ and $y$ must be integers.\n\nOur curve $E: y^2 = x^3 - 25x$ has coefficients $A = -25$ and $B=0$, which are integers. Thus, the Lutz-Nagell Theorem applies.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Point P**\nThe point $P$ has coordinates $\\left(x_P, y_P\\right) = \\left(\\frac{25}{4}, \\frac{75}{8}\\right)$. The coordinates $x_P = \\frac{25}{4}$ and $y_P = \\frac{75}{8}$ are rational but not integers.\nAccording to the Lutz-Nagell Theorem, since the coordinates of $P$ are not integers, $P$ cannot be a torsion point. A point on an elliptic curve that is not a torsion point must have infinite order.\nTherefore, the point $P$ lies on the curve $E$ and has infinite order. Its coordinates are nonintegral.\n\n**3. The Torsion Subgroup $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{tors}$**\nThe Lutz-Nagell theorem implies that any rational torsion point on $E$ must have integer coordinates.\nThe points where $y=0$, i.e., $(0,0)$, $(5,0)$, and $(-5,0)$, are torsion points with integer coordinates.\nTo check for other torsion points, we would search for other integer points $(x,y)$ on the curve and test if they have finite order. A more advanced result, Mazur's Torsion Theorem, states that the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is very restricted. For this specific curve, it is a known fact that the torsion subgroup is precisely the set of points of order dividing $2$:\n$E(\\mathbb{Q})_{tors} = \\{\\mathcal{O}, (0,0), (5,0), (-5,0)\\}$.\nAll finite points in this group have integral coordinates.\n\n**Summary of Conclusions:**\n- The point $P = \\left(\\frac{25}{4}, \\frac{75}{8}\\right)$ is on the curve $E$.\n- The coordinates of $P$ are not integers.\n- By the Lutz-Nagell theorem, $P$ is a point of infinite order.\n- The torsion subgroup of $E(\\mathbb{Q})$ is $\\{\\mathcal{O}, (0,0), (5,0), (-5,0)\\}$. The finite torsion points all have integral coordinates.\n\n### **Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.

The point $P$ has order $2$ and is therefore torsion, and there are additional torsion points with $x = \\pm 10$.**\n- \"The point $P$ has order $2$\": A point has order $2$ if and only if its $y$-coordinate is $0$. The $y$-coordinate of $P$ is $\\frac{75}{8} \\neq 0$. This is incorrect.\n- \"...and there are additional torsion points with $x = \\pm 10$\": Let's check for points with $x=10$. $y^2 = 10^3 - 25(10) = 1000 - 250 = 750$. Since $750$ is not a perfect square, there are no rational points with $x=10$. For $x=-10$, $y^2 = (-10)^3 - 25(-10) = -1000 + 250 = -750$, which has no solution in $\\mathbb{R}$, let alone $\\mathbb{Q}$. This is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The curve $E$ has no torsion points over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and although $P$ lies on $E$, it has integral coordinates.**\n- \"The curve $E$ has no torsion points over $\\mathbb{Q}$\": This is false. We have identified four torsion points: $\\mathcal{O}, (0,0), (5,0), (-5,0)$.\n- \"...it has integral coordinates\": This refers to point $P$. Its coordinates are $\\left(\\frac{25}{4}, \\frac{75}{8}\\right)$, which are not integral. This is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Every rational point on $E$ has integral coordinates, and therefore $P$ does not lie on $E$.**\n- \"Every rational point on $E$ has integral coordinates\": This is false. The point $P$ itself is a counterexample, as it is a rational point with non-integral coordinates.\n- \"...and therefore $P$ does not lie on $E$\": The premise is false, and this conclusion is also false, as we verified that $P$ lies on $E$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3086192"}, {"introduction": "Beyond classifying individual points, a central goal is to find the complete set of integer points on a given curve.

The final goal is to compute $S = N_{-2} + N_{7}$.\n\nPart 1: Determination of $N_{-2}$ for the curve $E_{-2}: y^{2} = x^{3} - 2$.\n\nWe rearrange the equation as $y^{2} + 2 = x^{3}$. This form suggests working in the ring of integers of the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-2})$, which is $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-2}] = \\{a+b\\sqrt{-2} \\mid a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. This ring is a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD), as it is a Euclidean domain. The units in this ring are $\\pm 1$.\n\nWe factor the equation in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-2}]$:\n$$ (y + \\sqrt{-2})(y - \\sqrt{-2}) = x^{3} $$\nLet $d$ be a greatest common divisor of the two factors, $y + \\sqrt{-2}$ and $y - \\sqrt{-2}$, in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-2}]$. Then $d$ must divide their difference:\n$$ d \\mid (y + \\sqrt{-2}) - (y - \\sqrt{-2}) = 2\\sqrt{-2} = -(\\sqrt{-2})^{3} $$\nThe prime factors of $2\\sqrt{-2}$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-2}]$ are, up to units, just $\\sqrt{-2}$. Thus, $d$ must be of the form $u(\\sqrt{-2})^{j}$ for some unit $u \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}$ and integer $j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nAlso, $d$ divides $y+\\sqrt{-2}$, so the norm of $d$, $N(d)$, must divide the norm of $y+\\sqrt{-2}$.\n$$ N(y+\\sqrt{-2}) = y^{2} + 2 = x^{3} $$\nThe norm of $d$ must also divide $N(2\\sqrt{-2}) = N(0+2\\sqrt{-2}) = 0^2 - (-2)(2^2) = 8$. So $N(d)$ must be a common divisor of $x^{3}$ and $8$.\n\nLet us examine the parity of $x$ and $y$. If $x$ is even, say $x=2k$, then $y^{2} = (2k)^{3} - 2 = 8k^{3}-2$. This implies $y^{2} \\equiv -2 \\equiv 6 \\pmod 8$. The squares modulo $8$ are $0^{2}\\equiv 0$, $1^{2}\\equiv 1$, $2^{2}\\equiv 4$, $3^{2}\\equiv 1$, $4^{2}\\equiv 0$, $5^{2}\\equiv 1$, $6^{2}\\equiv 4$, $7^{2}\\equiv 1$. The set of quadratic residues modulo $8$ is $\\{0,1,4\\}$. Since $6$ is not in this set, $y^{2} \\equiv 6 \\pmod 8$ has no integer solutions for $y$. Thus, $x$ cannot be even; $x$ must be odd.\n\nIf $x$ is odd, then $x^{3}$ is odd. Then $y^{2} = x^{3}-2$ must be odd, which implies $y$ must be odd.\nSince $x$ is odd, $x^{3}$ is odd. As $N(d)$ divides $x^{3}$, $N(d)$ must be odd. The divisors of $8$ are $1, 2, 4, 8$. The only odd divisor is $1$. Thus, $N(d)=1$.\nAn element in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-2}]$ with norm $1$ must be a unit. Therefore, $d$ is a unit. This means the factors $y+\\sqrt{-2}$ and $y-\\sqrt{-2}$ are coprime in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-2}]$.\n\nSince $(y+\\sqrt{-2})(y-\\sqrt{-2})$ is a perfect cube and the factors are coprime in a UFD, each factor must itself be a perfect cube, up to a unit factor. Since the only units are $\\pm 1$ and $-1 = (-1)^{3}$ can be absorbed into the cube, we can write:\n$$ y + \\sqrt{-2} = (a+b\\sqrt{-2})^{3} $$\nfor some integers $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Expanding the cube:\n$$ (a+b\\sqrt{-2})^{3} = a^{3} + 3a^{2}(b\\sqrt{-2}) + 3a(b\\sqrt{-2})^{2} + (b\\sqrt{-2})^{3} $$\n$$ = a^{3} + 3a^{2}b\\sqrt{-2} - 6ab^{2} - 2b^{3}\\sqrt{-2} $$\n$$ = (a^{3} - 6ab^{2}) + (3a^{2}b - 2b^{3})\\sqrt{-2} $$\nBy equating the real and imaginary parts with $y + \\sqrt{-2}$, we get a system of two equations:\n$$ y = a^{3} - 6ab^{2} $$\n$$ 1 = 3a^{2}b - 2b^{3} = b(3a^{2} - 2b^{2}) $$\nFrom the second equation, since $a, b$ are integers, $b$ must be a divisor of $1$. So, $b \\in \\{1, -1\\}$.\n\nCase 1: $b=1$.\nThe second equation becomes $1 = 3a^{2} - 2(1)^{2} \\implies 1 = 3a^{2} - 2 \\implies 3a^{2} = 3 \\implies a^{2}=1$. Thus, $a = \\pm 1$.\nIf $a=1, b=1$, then $y = 1^{3} - 6(1)(1)^{2} = 1-6 = -5$.\nWe find the corresponding $x$ value: $x^{3} = y^{2}+2 = (-5)^{2}+2 = 25+2 = 27$, which gives $x=3$.\nSo, $(x,y)=(3, -5)$ is a solution.\nIf $a=-1, b=1$, then $y = (-1)^{3} - 6(-1)(1)^{2} = -1+6 = 5$.\nWe find the corresponding $x$ value: $x^{3} = y^{2}+2 = 5^{2}+2 = 25+2 = 27$, which gives $x=3$.\nSo, $(x,y)=(3, 5)$ is a solution.\n\nCase 2: $b=-1$.\nThe second equation becomes $1 = (-1)(3a^{2} - 2(-1)^{2}) \\implies 1 = -(3a^{2}-2) \\implies 1 = -3a^{2}+2 \\implies 3a^{2}=1$. This equation $a^{2}=1/3$ has no integer solutions for $a$.\n\nTherefore, the only integer solutions for $y^{2}=x^{3}-2$ are $(3, 5)$ and $(3, -5)$. The number of integer points is $N_{-2} = 2$.\n\nPart 2: Determination of $N_{7}$ for the curve $E_{7}: y^{2} = x^{3} + 7$.\n\nWe analyze the equation using modular arithmetic.\nFirst, consider the equation modulo $8$. If $x$ were even, say $x=2m$, then $x^{3} = 8m^{3} \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$.\nThe equation becomes $y^{2} \\equiv 0+7 \\equiv 7 \\pmod 8$.\nThe squares modulo $8$ are $\\{0, 1, 4\\}$. Thus, $y^{2} \\equiv 7 \\pmod 8$ has no integer solutions for $y$. So, $x$ must be odd.\n\nNext, consider the equation modulo $4$. Since $x$ is odd, $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ or $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$.\nIf $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, then $x^{3} \\equiv 1^{3} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. The equation becomes $y^{2} \\equiv 1+7 = 8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$. This is possible (for even $y$).\nIf $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, then $x^{3} \\equiv 3^{3} = 27 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. The equation becomes $y^{2} \\equiv 3+7 = 10 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. The squares modulo $4$ are $\\{0, 1\\}$. Thus, $y^{2} \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$ has no solutions.\nTherefore, any integer solution must have $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\n\nNow we use an algebraic manipulation. We rewrite the equation as:\n$$ y^{2} + 1 = x^{3} + 8 $$\n$$ y^{2} + 1 = (x+2)(x^{2}-2x+4) $$\nFor $y^{2} = x^{3}+7$ to have real solutions for $y$, we need $x^{3}+7 \\ge 0$, which implies $x^{3} \\ge -7$. This means $x \\ge -1$.\nCombined with $x$ being odd and $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, the possible values for $x$ are positive integers $x \\in \\{1, 5, 9, 13, \\dots\\}$. The value $x=-3$ is ruled out as $x \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. For $x=-1$, we have $x\\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, which is also ruled out. So we only need to consider $x \\ge 1$ with $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\n\nFor such $x$, both factors $x+2$ and $x^{2}-2x+4 = (x-1)^{2}+3$ are positive integers.\nLet's analyze the factor $x+2$. Since $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, we have $x+2 \\equiv 1+2 = 3 \\pmod 4$.\nA positive integer that is congruent to $3$ modulo $4$ must have at least one prime factor $p$ that is also congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, with this prime factor appearing with an odd exponent in its prime factorization.\nLet $p$ be such a prime factor of $x+2$.\nThen $p \\mid (x+2)$, so $p \\mid (x+2)(x^{2}-2x+4) = y^{2}+1$.\nThis implies $y^{2}+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$, or $y^{2} \\equiv -1 \\pmod p$.\nThis means that $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$. A fundamental result in number theory states that for an odd prime $p$, the congruence $z^{2} \\equiv -1 \\pmod p$ has a solution if and only if $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\nOur prime $p$ was chosen such that $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. This leads to a contradiction. The only way to avoid this contradiction is if $x+2$ has no prime factors, meaning $x+2=1$. This gives $x=-1$, which we have already shown is not a possible value for a solution.\n\nThis argument requires that the factors $(x+2)$ and $(x^2-2x+4)$ are coprime. We check this possibility by computing their greatest common divisor. Let $d = \\gcd(x+2, x^{2}-2x+4)$. Then $d$ must divide any linear combination of these two.\n$$ d \\mid (x^{2}-2x+4) - (x-4)(x+2) = (x^2-2x+4) - (x^2-2x-8) = 12 $$\nSince $x$ is odd, $x+2$ is odd, and $x^{2}-2x+4$ is odd. Thus, their gcd, $d$, must be odd. The odd divisors of $12$ are $1$ and $3$.\nCase (a): $d=1$. The factors are coprime. The argument above holds without modification. As $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ and $x>0$, $x+2>1$ and $x+2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. Thus it must have a prime factor $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, leading to a contradiction. So no solutions in this case.\nCase (b): $d=3$. This occurs if $3 \\mid (x+2)$, which means $x \\equiv -2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. If $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, then $x^{2}-2x+4 \\equiv 1^{2}-2(1)+4=3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$, so $3 \\mid (x^{2}-2x+4)$ is consistent. In this case, both factors are divisible by $3$, so their product $y^{2}+1$ is divisible by $9$.\n$y^{2}+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 9 \\implies y^{2} \\equiv -1 \\equiv 8 \\pmod 9$.\nThe squares modulo $9$ are $\\{0^{2}, (\\pm 1)^{2}, (\\pm 2)^{2}, (\\pm 3)^{2}, (\\pm 4)^{2}\\} \\pmod 9$, which is the set $\\{0, 1, 4, 0, 7\\}$. The set of quadratic residues mod $9$ is $\\{0,1,4,7\\}$. Since $8$ is not in this set, there are no integer solutions for $y$.\n\nBoth cases lead to no solutions. We conclude that there are no integer points on the curve $y^{2} = x^{3} + 7$.\nTherefore, $N_{7} = 0$.\n\nPart 3: Final Computation.\n\nWe are asked to compute $S = N_{-2} + N_{7}$.\nFrom our analysis, we found $N_{-2} = 2$ and $N_{7} = 0$.\n$$ S = 2 + 0 = 2 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3086249"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice expands the goal from finding integer points to determining the precise structure of the rational torsion subgroup, $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}$.

We must have $4 \\le 2\\sqrt{11} \\approx 6.63$, which is true.\n\nThird, we use these results to bound the order of the torsion subgroup, $m = |E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|$. The reduction homomorphism $E(\\mathbb{Q}) \\to E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ is injective on the subgroup of torsion points whose order is coprime to $p$. Let $T = E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}$. Then for a prime $p$ of good reduction, the order of the image of $T$ in $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ divides $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$. The kernel of this map on $T$ consists of points whose order is a power of $p$.\nA stronger consequence is that for any prime $q$, if $q$ divides $m$, then there is an element of order $q$ in $T$. If $q \\neq p$, this element maps to an element of order $q$ in $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, so $q$ must divide $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$.\n- For $p=3$, any prime factor $q \\neq 3$ of $m$ must divide $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_3)=4$. So $q=2$.\n- For $p=7$, any prime factor $q \\neq 7$ of $m$ must divide $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_7)=12=2^2 \\cdot 3$. So $q \\in \\{2,3\\}$.\n- For $p=11$, any prime factor $q \\neq 11$ of $m$ must divide $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{11})=8=2^3$. So $q=2$.\nIf $q=3$ were a prime factor of $m$, then since $3 \\neq 11$, $3$ would have to divide $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{11})=8$, which is false. So $m$ is not divisible by $3$. The only possible prime factor of $m$ is $2$. Thus $m$ must be a power of $2$.\nSince $m$ is a power of $2$, its order is coprime to $p$ for $p \\in \\{3, 7, 11\\}$. Therefore, the reduction map is injective on the entire torsion group $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}$ for each of these primes. This implies that the order $m$ must divide $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ for each $p$.\n$$\nm \\mid \\gcd(\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_3), \\#E(\\mathbb{F}_7), \\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{11}))\n$$\n$$\nm \\mid \\gcd(4, 12, 8) = 4.\n$$\nThe possible orders of the torsion subgroup are $1, 2, 4$.\n\nFourth, we use the Nagell–Lutz theorem to find all rational torsion points. Such points $(x,y)$ must have integer coordinates $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Furthermore, if $P=(x,y)$ is a torsion point with $y \\neq 0$, then $y^2$ must divide $\\Delta=80$. The square divisors of $80=16 \\cdot 5$ are $1$, $4$, and $16$. We test these possibilities along with the case $y=0$.\n\nCase 1: $y=0$.\nThe equation becomes $x^3-2x+1=0$. By the rational root theorem, any integer root must divide $1$. Testing $x=1$ gives $1^3-2(1)+1 = 0$. So $(1,0)$ is a point on $E$. Points with $y=0$ are of order $2$.\n\nCase 2: $y^2=1$.\nThe equation is $x^3-2x+1=1$, which simplifies to $x^3-2x=0$ or $x(x^2-2)=0$. The only integer solution is $x=0$. This gives two points: $(0,1)$ and $(0,-1)$.\n\nCase 3: $y^2=4$.\nThe equation is $x^3-2x+1=4$, or $x^3-2x-3=0$. Any integer root must divide $-3$. Testing $x \\in \\{\\pm 1, \\pm 3\\}$:\n- $f(1) = 1-2-3 = -4 \\neq 0$.\n- $f(-1) = -1+2-3 = -2 \\neq 0$.\n- $f(3) = 27-6-3 = 18 \\neq 0$.\n- $f(-3) = -27+6-3 = -24 \\neq 0$.\nThere are no integer solutions for $x$.\n\nCase 4: $y^2=16$.\nThe equation is $x^3-2x+1=16$, or $x^3-2x-15=0$. Any integer root must divide $-15$. Testing $x=3$ gives $3^3-2(3)-15=27-6-15=6 \\neq 0$. No other integer root candidates work either.\n\nThe set of possible torsion points with integer coordinates is therefore $\\{\\mathcal{O}, (1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)\\}$. We check their orders.\nLet $P_1 = (1,0)$. As $y=0$, $P_1$ has order $2$. So $2P_1 = \\mathcal{O}$.\nLet $P_2 = (0,1)$. To find its order, we compute $2P_2$. The slope of the tangent at $P_2$ is $\\lambda = \\frac{3x^2+A}{2y} = \\frac{3(0)^2-2}{2(1)} = -1$.\nThe x-coordinate of $2P_2$ is $x_3 = \\lambda^2 - 2x = (-1)^2 - 2(0) = 1$.\nThe y-coordinate of $2P_2$ is $y_3 = \\lambda(x - x_3) - y = -1(0-1)-1=0$.\nSo, $2P_2 = (1,0) = P_1$.\nThen $4P_2 = 2(2P_2) = 2P_1 = \\mathcal{O}$. Since $2P_2 \\neq \\mathcal{O}$, the order of $P_2=(0,1)$ is $4$. The point $(0,-1)$ is $-P_2$ and also has order $4$.\nThe set of points $\\{\\mathcal{O}, P_2, 2P_2, 3P_2\\} = \\{\\mathcal{O}, (0,1), (1,0), (0,-1)\\}$ forms a cyclic group of order $4$.\nThe Nagell-Lutz search has yielded $4$ torsion points. This implies $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}| \\ge 4$.\n\nCombining our findings:\n1. $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|$ must divide $4$.\n2. We have found $4$ distinct torsion points.\nTherefore, the exact order of the torsion subgroup is $4$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4}\n$$", "id": "3086205"}]}
