It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in measure theory, providing all necessary information and definitions without contradiction or ambiguity. It requests a derivation of a standard result from first principles, which is a legitimate and meaningful mathematical exercise. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive the Lebesgue volume, denoted $\\operatorname{vol}(K)$, of the $n$-dimensional box $K$ defined as\n$$\nK = \\prod_{i=1}^{n}[-a_{i}, a_{i}] = \\{(x_1, \\dots, x_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid \\forall i \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}, -a_i \\le x_i \\le a_i \\}\n$$\nwhere $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and each $a_i  0$. The volume of a measurable set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$ is given by the Lebesgue integral of its characteristic function, $\\chi_S$, over $\\mathbb{R}^n$. For the set $K$, this is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{vol}(K) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\chi_K(\\mathbf{x}) \\, d\\mathbf{x}\n$$\nBy definition of the characteristic function, $\\chi_K(\\mathbf{x}) = 1$ if $\\mathbf{x} \\in K$ and $\\chi_K(\\mathbf{x}) = 0$ if $\\mathbf{x} \\notin K$. Therefore, the integral can be restricted to the domain $K$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{vol}(K) = \\int_{K} 1 \\, d\\mathbf{x}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the derivation should use Fubini's theorem. Since the integrand is the constant function $f(\\mathbf{x}) = 1$, which is non-negative and measurable, and the domain of integration $K$ is a product of measurable sets (intervals), Fubini's theorem allows us to compute the $n$-dimensional integral as an iterated integral:\n$$\n\\operatorname{vol}(K) = \\int_{-a_1}^{a_1} \\left( \\int_{-a_2}^{a_2} \\cdots \\left( \\int_{-a_n}^{a_n} 1 \\, dx_n \\right) \\cdots dx_2 \\right) dx_1\n$$\nBecause the limits of integration for each variable do not depend on the other variables, the iterated integral can be separated into a product of $n$ one-dimensional integrals:\n$$\n\\operatorname{vol}(K) = \\left( \\int_{-a_1}^{a_1} 1 \\, dx_1 \\right) \\left( \\int_{-a_2}^{a_2} 1 \\, dx_2 \\right) \\cdots \\left( \\int_{-a_n}^{a_n} 1 \\, dx_n \\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\int_{-a_i}^{a_i} 1 \\, dx_i \\right)\n$$\nWe must now evaluate each one-dimensional integral $\\int_{-a_i}^{a_i} 1 \\, dx_i$. This integral represents the Lebesgue measure of the interval $[-a_i, a_i]$, which we will denote as $\\lambda([-a_i, a_i])$. We derive this value from the first principles stipulated in the problem.\n\n1.  **Definition of Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{R}$**: The Lebesgue measure $\\lambda$ on $\\mathbb{R}$ is defined such that for any bounded interval $I$, its measure $\\lambda(I)$ is its length. For a closed interval $[c, d]$, the length is $d-c$.\n\n2.  **Finite Additivity and Translation Invariance**: To be rigorous, we can decompose the interval $[-a_i, a_i]$ into two disjoint pieces whose union is almost the entire interval: $[-a_i, a_i] = [-a_i, 0] \\cup (0, a_i]$. Since the intersection $\\{0\\}$ has measure zero, finite additivity implies:\n    $$\n    \\lambda([-a_i, a_i]) = \\lambda([-a_i, 0]) + \\lambda((0, a_i])\n    $$\n    By the definition of Lebesgue measure as length, $\\lambda((0, a_i]) = a_i - 0 = a_i$. The first term, $\\lambda([-a_i, 0])$, can be evaluated using translation invariance. Let us translate the interval $[-a_i, 0]$ by $+a_i$:\n    $$\n    \\lambda([-a_i, 0]) = \\lambda([-a_i + a_i, 0 + a_i]) = \\lambda([0, a_i])\n    $$\n    By definition, the length of $[0, a_i]$ is $a_i - 0 = a_i$. Therefore,\n    $$\n    \\lambda([-a_i, a_i]) = a_i + a_i = 2a_i\n    $$\n    Alternatively, and more directly, applying the length definition to the interval $[-a_i, a_i]$ gives the length $a_i - (-a_i) = 2a_i$.\n\nThus, for each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, the value of the corresponding integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{-a_i}^{a_i} 1 \\, dx_i = \\lambda([-a_i, a_i]) = 2a_i\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the product expression for $\\operatorname{vol}(K)$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{vol}(K) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} (2a_i)\n$$\nBy factoring out the constant $2$ from each term in the product, we obtain the final closed-form expression:\n$$\n\\operatorname{vol}(K) = 2^n \\prod_{i=1}^{n} a_i\n$$\nThis derivation uses only the foundational principles as required: the definition of Lebesgue measure on intervals in $\\mathbb{R}$, its fundamental properties (translation invariance and additivity), and its extension to $\\mathbb{R}^n$ via Fubini's theorem for iterated integration. The resulting expression is an explicit formula for the volume of the box $K$ in terms of its defining parameters $a_1, \\dots, a_n$ and the dimension $n$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2^{n} \\prod_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}}\n$$", "id": "3087191"}, {"introduction": "With the ability to calculate volume, we can now apply Minkowski's theorem in its entirety.

A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the application of Minkowski's convex body theorem. Let us state the theorem for clarity. In $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, let $\\Lambda$ be a full-rank lattice and let $C$ be a centrally symmetric, convex, measurable set. If $\\operatorname{vol}(C)  2^{n} \\det(\\Lambda)$, then $C$ contains at least one nonzero point of $\\Lambda$.\n\nThe problem is set in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, so the dimension is $n=2$. The lattice is $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$. The set is $C_t = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : |x| + |y| \\le t\\}$.\n\nFirst, we must compute the determinant of the lattice, $\\det(\\Lambda)$. The standard integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ is generated by the standard basis vectors of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, which are $\\mathbf{e}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{e}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. A basis matrix $B$ for $\\Lambda$ can be formed by taking these vectors as columns:\n$$\nB = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = I_2\n$$\nThe determinant of the lattice is the absolute value of the determinant of this matrix:\n$$\n\\det(\\Lambda) = |\\det(B)| = |\\det(I_2)| = |1| = 1\n$$\nSo, the determinant of the lattice $\\Lambda=\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ is $1$.\n\nNext, we must compute the volume (which is the area in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$) of the set $C_t$. The set $C_t$ is a square in the plane, rotated by $45$ degrees, with vertices at $(t, 0)$, $(0, t)$, $(-t, 0)$, and $(0, -t)$. We can compute its area, $\\operatorname{vol}(C_t)$, using a double integral.\n$$\n\\operatorname{vol}(C_t) = \\iint_{|x|+|y|\\le t} 1 \\, dx \\, dy\n$$\nDue to the symmetry of the domain with respect to both the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis, we can compute the area in the first quadrant ($x \\ge 0$, $y \\ge 0$) and multiply the result by $4$. In the first quadrant, the inequality $|x|+|y|\\le t$ simplifies to $x+y \\le t$, or $y \\le t-x$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{vol}(C_t) = 4 \\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{0}^{t-x} 1 \\, dy \\, dx\n$$\nWe evaluate the inner integral with respect to $y$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t-x} 1 \\, dy = [y]_{0}^{t-x} = t-x\n$$\nNow, we substitute this back into the outer integral with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{vol}(C_t) = 4 \\int_{0}^{t} (t-x) \\, dx = 4 \\left[ tx - \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{t}\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integral:\n$$\n\\operatorname{vol}(C_t) = 4 \\left( \\left(t \\cdot t - \\frac{t^2}{2}\\right) - \\left(t \\cdot 0 - \\frac{0^2}{2}\\right) \\right) = 4 \\left( t^2 - \\frac{t^2}{2} \\right) = 4 \\left( \\frac{t^2}{2} \\right) = 2t^2\n$$\nSo, the volume of the set $C_t$ is $2t^2$.\n\nNow we apply Minkowski's theorem.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nThe proof of Minkowski's theorem described is based on Blichfeldt's principle, which states that for any lattice $L$ and any measurable set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ with $\\operatorname{vol}(S)  \\det(L)$, there exist two distinct points $s_1, s_2 \\in S$ such that $s_1 - s_2 \\in L$.\n\nHere, $L = \\mathbb{Z}^n$, so $\\det(L) = 1$. The proof considers the set $S = K/2 = \\{k/2 : k \\in K\\}$. The volume of this set is $\\operatorname{vol}(K/2) = (1/2)^n \\operatorname{vol}(K)$. The condition $\\operatorname{vol}(K)  2^n$ implies that $\\operatorname{vol}(K/2)  1$. Thus, by Blichfeldt's principle, there exist two distinct points $x, y \\in K/2$ such that their difference $v = x-y$ is a non-zero lattice point, i.e., $v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\nSince $x, y \\in K/2$, we can write $x = k_1/2$ and $y = k_2/2$ for some distinct points $k_1, k_2 \\in K$.\nTherefore, the non-zero lattice point is $v = x-y = \\frac{k_1 - k_2}{2}$.\n\nThe problem now hinges on the conditions required to prove that a non-zero lattice point lies within $K$. The standard proof aims to show that $v = (k_1 - k_2)/2$ itself lies in $K$.\n\nLet us evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Take $K = B_R(u) := \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : \\lVert x - u \\rVert_2 \\le R\\}$ with $u \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}^n$ fixed and $R$ chosen so that $\\operatorname{vol}(K)  2^n$. Then $K$ is convex and not origin-symmetric. The pigeonhole step provides $x,y \\in K/2$ with $x - y \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$, but without symmetry about the origin we cannot conclude $x - y \\in K$. If, in addition, $K$ is assumed centrally symmetric about the origin, then the proof proceeds to show $K$ contains a nonzero lattice point.**\n\n-   **Example of failure:** The set $K=B_R(u)$ is a ball of radius $R$ centered at $u$. For any $u \\neq 0$, it is not origin-symmetric. It is convex. We choose $R$ such that its volume is greater than $2^n$. The pigeonhole step provides a non-zero lattice point $v = (k_1-k_2)/2$ where $k_1, k_2 \\in B_R(u)$. The difference $k_1-k_2$ lies in the set $K-K = B_R(u) - B_R(u) = B_{2R}(0)$. Thus, $v \\in B_R(0)$. The question is whether $v \\in K = B_R(u)$, which requires $\\|v-u\\|_2 \\le R$. Let $n=2$, $u=(10,0)$ and $R=3$. Then $\\operatorname{vol}(K)=9\\pi  4$. A possible lattice point found is $v=(3,0)$, since $\\|v\\|_2=3 \\le R$. However, for this $v$ to be in $K$, we require $\\|v-u\\|_2 = \\|(3,0)-(10,0)\\|_2 = 7 \\le R=3$, which is false. Thus, the example correctly illustrates the failure of the step $x-y \\in K$.\n-   **Restoring Hypothesis:** The option proposes assuming $K$ is centrally symmetric about the origin. This means for any point $p \\in K$, the point $-p$ is also in $K$. With $k_1, k_2 \\in K$, we have $k_1 \\in K$ and $-k_2 \\in K$. Since $K$ is convex, the midpoint of these two points must also be in $K$: $\\frac{1}{2}(k_1 + (-k_2)) = \\frac{k_1-k_2}{2} = v \\in K$. This shows that the non-zero lattice point $v$ is in $K$, restoring the conclusion.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Take $K = B_R(u)$ as in option A. The pigeonhole step provides $x,y \\in K/2$ with $x - y \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$. Convexity of $K$ alone (without any symmetry) is sufficient to conclude $x - y \\in K$ and hence $K$ contains a nonzero lattice point for $\\operatorname{vol}(K)  2^n$.**\n\n-   **Claim:** This option claims convexity is a sufficient condition.\n-   **Analysis:** As shown in the analysis of option A, convexity alone is not sufficient. The vector $v = (k_1-k_2)/2$ is not a convex combination of $k_1$ and $k_2$ (the coefficients $1/2$ and $-1/2$ do not sum to $1$). The counterexample from option A demonstrates this, where for the convex set $K=B_3((10,0))$, the lattice point $v=(3,0)$ found via the pigeonhole argument is not in $K$.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Take $K = B_R(u)$ as in option A. The pigeonhole step provides $x,y \\in K/2$ with $x - y \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$, and assuming only that $K$ is centrally symmetric about some point $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ (with no restriction on $c$) is enough to guarantee that $K$ contains a nonzero lattice point whenever $\\operatorname{vol}(K)  2^n$.**\n\n-   **Claim:** Central symmetry about an arbitrary point $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a sufficient condition.\n-   **Analysis:** Let $K$ be convex and symmetric about $c$. The proof that relies on Blichfeldt's principle gives us $v=(k_1-k_2)/2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$ for some $k_1, k_2 \\in K$. Since $k_2 \\in K$, symmetry about $c$ implies that $2c-k_2 \\in K$. By convexity, the midpoint of $k_1$ and $2c-k_2$ is in $K$: $\\frac{1}{2}(k_1 + (2c-k_2)) = \\frac{k_1-k_2}{2} + c = v+c \\in K$. So we have shown that the point $v+c$ is in $K$. However, since $c$ can be any point in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, $v+c$ is not guaranteed to be a lattice point. For example, if $v=(1,0,...,0)$ and $c=(1/2, 0, ..., 0)$, then $v+c=(3/2,0,...,0)$ is not in $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. Therefore, this condition does not guarantee that $K$ contains a lattice point.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Take $K$ to be a large-volume simplex... The pigeonhole step provides $x,y \\in K/2$ with $x - y \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$, and requiring only that $0 \\in \\operatorname{int}(K)$ suffices to conclude that $K$ contains a nonzero lattice point whenever $\\operatorname{vol}(K)  2^n$.**\n\n-   **Claim:** The condition $0 \\in \\operatorname{int}(K)$ is sufficient.\n-   **Analysis:** If $K$ is convex and contains $0$ in its interior, one might try to apply Minkowski's theorem to the set $K' = K \\cap (-K)$. This set $K'$ is convex and origin-symmetric. However, there is no guarantee that $\\operatorname{vol}(K')  2^n$ just because $\\operatorname{vol}(K)  2^n$. Consider a convex set elongated in one direction, for example, $K = [- \\epsilon, M] \\times [-1, 1]$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Let $M$ be large and $\\epsilon$ be small. We can choose $M$ and $\\epsilon$ such that $0 \\in \\operatorname{int}(K)$ and $\\operatorname{vol}(K) = (M+\\epsilon) \\times 2  2^2=4$. The set $-K = [-M, \\epsilon] \\times [-1, 1]$. The intersection is $K' = K \\cap (-K) = [-\\epsilon, \\epsilon] \\times [-1, 1]$, which has volume $2\\epsilon \\times 2 = 4\\epsilon$. We can make this volume less than $4$ by choosing a sufficiently small $\\epsilon$, for example $\\epsilon=0.1$. The argument fails. The condition $0 \\in \\operatorname{int}(K)$ is not sufficient.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Take $K$ as in option A to illustrate the failure... A sufficient additional hypothesis that restores the conclusion is that $K$ is centrally symmetric about a lattice point $c \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$ (equivalently, $K - c$ is origin-symmetric). Under this hypothesis, whenever $\\operatorname{vol}(K)  2^n$, the set $K$ contains a nonzero lattice point.**\n\n-   **Example of failure:** Same as in A, which is a valid illustration.\n-   **Restoring Hypothesis:** The condition is that $K$ is convex, $\\operatorname{vol}(K)  2^n$, and $K$ is centrally symmetric about a lattice point $c \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$. Let's test this.\n    There are two ways to prove this.\n    1.  *Via translation:* Let $K' = K-c = \\{k-c : k \\in K\\}$. Since $K$ is symmetric about $c$, $K'$ is symmetric about the origin. $K'$ is also convex. Its volume is $\\operatorname{vol}(K') = \\operatorname{vol}(K)  2^n$. By the standard Minkowski theorem (as in option A), $K'$ must contain a non-zero lattice point $v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$. The existence of such a $v \\in K'$ means $v=k-c$ for some $k \\in K$. This implies $k = v+c$. Since $v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$ and $c \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$, their sum $k$ is also a lattice point in $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. So we have found a lattice point $k \\in K$.\n        Is it non-zero? If $k \\neq 0$, we are done. If $k=0$, then $v+c=0$, so $v=-c$. Since $v \\neq 0$, $c$ must be a non-zero lattice point. In this case, we have $0 \\in K$. By symmetry of $K$ about $c$, the point $2c-0=2c$ must also be in $K$. As $c$ is a non-zero lattice point, $2c$ is a non-zero lattice point. In all cases, $K$ contains a non-zero lattice point.\n    2.  *Following the pigeonhole argument:* The argument leading to $v+c \\in K$ from option C is valid. Here, since $c \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$ and $v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$, the point $v+c$ is a lattice point contained in $K$. The same argument as above shows that this guarantees a non-zero lattice point in $K$.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "3087174"}]}
