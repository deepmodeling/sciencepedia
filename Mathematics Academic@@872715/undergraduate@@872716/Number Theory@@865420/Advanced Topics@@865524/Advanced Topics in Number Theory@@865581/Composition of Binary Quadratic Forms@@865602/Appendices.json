First, we must determine the complete list of reduced primitive positive definite binary quadratic forms of discriminant $D = -4$ and thereby find the class number $h(-4)$. Second, we must compute the Gauss composition of the principal reduced form with itself.\n\nPart 1: Determination of Reduced Forms and Class Number $h(-4)$\n\nA binary quadratic form $Q(x,y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$ is specified by the integer coefficients $(a, b, c)$. The discriminant is $D = b^2 - 4ac$. We are given $D = -4$. The form must be primitive, i.e., $\\gcd(a, b, c) = 1$, and positive definite, i.e., $D  0$ and $a  0$.\n\nA form is reduced if it satisfies the inequalities $|b| \\leq a \\leq c$, with the additional condition that if $|b| = a$ or $a = c$, then $b \\geq 0$.\n\nLet's find all integer triples $(a, b, c)$ that satisfy these conditions for $D=-4$.\nThe discriminant equation is $b^2 - 4ac = -4$, which can be rewritten as $4ac = b^2 + 4$.\nSince $a$ and $c$ are integers, $b^2+4$ must be divisible by $4$. This implies that $b^2$ must be divisible by $4$, which in turn implies that $b$ must be an even integer. Let $b = 2k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nWe use the reduction inequalities to constrain the possible values of $a$, $b$, and $c$.\nFrom the positive definite condition, we have $a  0$.\nThe reduction conditions are $|b| \\leq a$ and $a \\leq c$.\nSince $a \\leq c$, we have $4a^2 \\leq 4ac$. Substituting $4ac = b^2 + 4$, we get $4a^2 \\leq b^2 + 4$.\nFrom $|b| \\leq a$, we have $b^2 \\leq a^2$.\nCombining these inequalities, we have:\n$4a^2 \\leq b^2 + 4 \\leq a^2 + 4$\nThis leads to $3a^2 \\leq 4$.\n\nSince $a$ must be a positive integer, $a^2$ must be a positive integer. The inequality $a^2 \\leq \\frac{4}{3}$ has only one positive integer solution for $a^2$, which is $a^2 = 1$. This implies $a = 1$.\n\nNow that we have determined $a=1$, we use the condition $|b| \\leq a$ to find $b$.\n$|b| \\leq 1$.\nAs established earlier, $b$ must be an even integer. The only even integer $b$ satisfying $|b| \\leq 1$ is $b = 0$.\n\nFinally, we find the value of $c$ using the discriminant equation:\n$b^2 - 4ac = -4$\n$0^2 - 4(1)c = -4$\n$-4c = -4$\n$c = 1$.\n\nThis gives us a unique candidate for a reduced form: the triple of coefficients $(a,b,c) = (1, 0, 1)$. We must verify that this form satisfies all the required conditions.\n1. Form: $Q(x,y) = 1x^2 + 0xy + 1y^2 = x^2 + y^2$.\n2. Discriminant: $D = 0^2 - 4(1)(1) = -4$. This is correct.\n3. Positive definite: $D  0$ and $a = 1  0$. This is correct.\n4. Primitive: $\\gcd(a, b, c) = \\gcd(1, 0, 1) = 1$. This is correct.\n5. Reduced:\n   - $|b| \\leq a \\implies |0| \\leq 1$, which is true.\n   - $a \\leq c \\implies 1 \\leq 1$, which is true.\n   - Tie-breaking condition: Since $a=c=1$, we must have $b \\geq 0$. Our value $b=0$ satisfies this.\nThe form $(1, 0, 1)$ is indeed a reduced primitive positive definite form of discriminant $D=-4$. Since it is the only such form we found, the complete list of such forms consists of just this one form.\n\nThe class number, denoted $h(D)$, is the number of distinct proper equivalence classes of primitive positive definite forms of discriminant $D$. This is equal to the number of reduced forms.\nSince there is only one reduced form, the class number is $h(-4) = 1$.\n\nPart 2: Gauss Composition\n\nWe are asked to compose the principal reduced form of discriminant $D=-4$ with itself. The principal form is the form representing the identity element of the class group. For positive definite forms, this is the form with $a=1$. In our case, the only reduced form is $(1, 0, 1)$, so this is necessarily the principal form.\n\nLet $Q_1(x_1, y_1) = x_1^2 + y_1^2$ and $Q_2(x_2, y_2) = x_2^2 + y_2^2$. The coefficients are $(a_1, b_1, c_1) = (1, 0, 1)$ and $(a_2, b_2, c_2) = (1, 0, 1)$. We want to find the coefficients $(a'', b'', c'')$ of the composed form $Q'' = Q_1 \\circ Q_2$.\n\nThe theory of Gauss composition provides a method to construct the composed form. First, we compute $g = \\gcd(a_1, a_2, \\frac{b_1+b_2}{2})$.\nWith our values, $g = \\gcd(1, 1, \\frac{0+0}{2}) = \\gcd(1, 1, 0) = 1$.\n\nThe first coefficient of the composed form, $a''$, is given by $a'' = \\frac{a_1 a_2}{g^2}$.\n$a'' = \\frac{1 \\cdot 1}{1^2} = 1$.\n\nThe second coefficient, $b''$, is an integer $B$ that is a simultaneous solution to the following system of congruences:\n1. $B \\equiv b_1 \\pmod{2a_1/g}$\n2. $B \\equiv b_2 \\pmod{2a_2/g}$\n3. $B^2 \\equiv D \\pmod{4a_1 a_2 / g^2}$\n\nSubstituting the given values ($a_1=1, b_1=0, a_2=1, b_2=0, D=-4, g=1$):\n1. $B \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2(1)/1} \\implies B \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n2. $B \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2(1)/1} \\implies B \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n3. $B^2 \\equiv -4 \\pmod{4(1)(1)/1^2} \\implies B^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$.\n\nFrom the first congruence, $B$ must be an even integer. Let $B = 2k$ for some integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSubstituting this into the third congruence: $(2k)^2 = 4k^2$. This is always divisible by $4$, so $4k^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$ for any integer $k$.\nThus, any even integer $B$ is a valid solution to the congruence system. The specific choice of $B$ affects which form within the resulting equivalence class is produced. We can choose the simplest solution, $B = 0$.\nSo, we take $b'' = 0$.\n\nThe third coefficient, $c''$, is determined by the requirement that the composed form must also have discriminant $D = -4$:\n$b''^2 - 4a''c'' = D$\n$0^2 - 4(1)c'' = -4$\n$-4c'' = -4$\n$c'' = 1$.\n\nThe resulting composed form is given by the coefficients $(a'', b'', c'') = (1, 0, 1)$.\nWe must check that this form is primitive: $\\gcd(a'', b'', c'') = \\gcd(1, 0, 1) = 1$. It is.\n\nThus, the composition of the principal form $(1, 0, 1)$ with itself yields the form $(1, 0, 1)$. This result is expected, since the class group $Cl(-4)$ has order $h(-4)=1$. The only element is the identity class, which must be its own inverse, and composing it with itself must yield the identity again.\n\nThe final answer requires the class number $h(-4)$ and the coefficients of the composed form $(a'', b'', c'')$.\n$h(-4) = 1$\n$(a'', b'', c'') = (1, 0, 1)$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3015035"}, {"introduction": "Having confirmed how the identity element behaves, we now advance to the simplest non-trivial group structure.

The discriminant for this form is $D = b^2 - 4ac = 1^2 - 4(2)(2) = 1 - 16 = -15$. The problem states that the discriminant is $D = -15$, which is consistent. The form $[2,1,2]$ is primitive since $\\text{gcd}(2,1,2) = 1$.

This is true.\nHowever, we have a case where $|b'|=a'$. The reduction condition requires that in this case, the middle coefficient must be non-negative, i.e., $b' \\geq 0$. Our form has $b'=-1$, which violates this condition. So, $[1,-1,4]$ is not yet reduced.\n\nStep 3: To address this, we apply an equivalence transformation of the type $(a',b',c') \\to (a', b'+2a'k, c'')$ for an integer $k$, choosing $k$ such that the new middle coefficient $b'' = b'+2a'k$ falls in the range $[-a', a']$ and satisfies the non-negativity condition if needed.\nWith $a'=1$ and $b'=-1$, we have $b'' = -1+2(1)k$.\nWe want $|b''| \\leq a'$, i.e., $|-1+2k| \\leq 1$.\nIf we choose $k=1$, then $b'' = -1+2(1) = 1$.\nThe condition $|1| \\leq 1$ is satisfied. Since we now have $|b''|=a'$, we require $b'' \\geq 0$. Our new $b''=1$ satisfies this.\nSo, we use $k=1$. The new form $[a'', b'', c'']$ will have $a''=a'=1$ and $b''=1$.\nThe third coefficient $c''$ is determined by the discriminant:\n$c'' = \\frac{(b'')^2-D}{4a''} = \\frac{1^2 - (-15)}{4 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{16}{4} = 4$.\nThus, the new form is $[1,1,4]$.\n\nStep 4: Finally, we check if the form $[1,1,4]$ is reduced. Let $a''=1, b''=1, c''=4$.\nThe condition $|b''| \\leq a'' \\leq c''$ translates to $|1| \\leq 1 \\leq 4$, which is true.\nWe have $|b''|=a''$, so we must check if $b'' \\geq 0$. Since $b''=1$, this is also true.\nThe form $[1,1,4]$ is reduced. This is the unique reduced representative of the composed class.\n\nThe problem asks for the leading coefficient $a$ of the reduced composed form.\nThe reduced composed form is $[1,1,4]$. Its leading coefficient is $1$.\nThis result aligns with the structure of the class group $Cl(-15)$, which is a group of order $2$. The elements are the classes of the principal form $[1,1,4]$ (the identity) and the form $[2,1,2]$. Squaring the non-identity element $[2,1,2]$ yields the identity element $[1,1,4]$.\nThe leading coefficient of the reduced composed form is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3085624"}]}
