A non-zero integer $D$ is the discriminant of some integral binary quadratic form $ax^{2} + bxy + cy^{2}$ (where $a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{Z}$) if and only if it satisfies the congruence relation $D \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$ or $D \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\nWe test the provided integer $D = -13824$.\nWe can write $-13824 = 4 \\times (-3456)$. Since $-13824$ is an integer multiple of $4$, it is congruent to $0$ modulo $4$.\n$$ -13824 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4} $$\nThe condition is satisfied. Therefore, $D = -13824$ is a valid discriminant.\n\nNext, we need to find the unique decomposition $D = D_{0} f^{2}$, where $D_{0}$ is a fundamental discriminant and $f \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 1}$ is the conductor. A fundamental discriminant is a discriminant $D_0$ which is not of the form $k^2 D_1$ for any integer $k > 1$ and discriminant $D_1$. Equivalently, an integer $D_{0} \\neq 1$ is a fundamental discriminant if and only if one of the following conditions holds:\n1. $D_{0} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ and $D_{0}$ is square-free.\n2. $D_{0} = 4m$ for some square-free integer $m$ such that $m \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$ or $m \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nTo find $D_{0}$ and $f$, we follow a systematic procedure. We begin by finding the prime factorization of $|D|$:\n$$ |D| = 13824 $$\nWe can factorize this as:\n$$ 13824 = 128 \\times 108 = 2^7 \\times (4 \\times 27) = 2^7 \\times 2^2 \\times 3^3 = 2^9 \\cdot 3^3 $$\nSo, the integer $D$ is $D = -2^9 \\cdot 3^3$.\n\nEvery discriminant $D$ can be uniquely written as $D = s \\cdot k^2$, where $s$ is a square-free integer and $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 1}$. We identify the largest perfect square that divides $|D|$.\n$$ |D| = 2^9 \\cdot 3^3 = (2 \\cdot 3) \\cdot (2^8 \\cdot 3^2) = 6 \\cdot (2^4 \\cdot 3)^2 = 6 \\cdot 48^2 $$\nThus, we can write $D = -6 \\cdot 48^2$. In this form, the square-free part is $s = -6$.\n\nThe fundamental discriminant $D_0$ corresponding to the quadratic order is determined by the square-free kernel $s$. The rules are as follows:\n- If $s \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, then the fundamental discriminant is $D_0 = s$.\n- If $s \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$ or $s \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, then the fundamental discriminant is $D_0 = 4s$.\n\nWe check the congruence class of our square-free kernel $s = -6$:\n$$ s = -6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4} $$\nSince $s \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, we are in the second case. The fundamental discriminant is given by $D_0 = 4s$.\n$$ D_0 = 4 \\times (-6) = -24 $$\n\nLet us verify that $D_0 = -24$ is indeed a fundamental discriminant. We check it against the conditions:\n1. Is $D_0 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$? No, $-24 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n2. So we check the second condition. We write $D_0 = 4m$. Here, $m = -24/4 = -6$. Is $m$ square-free? Yes, $-6 = -1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3$ has no repeated prime factors. Is $m \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$ or $m \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$? We have $m = -6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$.\nThe conditions are satisfied, so $D_0 = -24$ is a fundamental discriminant.\n\nFinally, we determine the conductor $f$. The conductor is an integer $f \\ge 1$ such that $D = D_0 f^2$. We can solve for $f^2$:\n$$ f^2 = \\frac{D}{D_0} = \\frac{-13824}{-24} = \\frac{13824}{24} $$\nUsing the prime factorizations we found earlier:\n$$ f^2 = \\frac{2^9 \\cdot 3^3}{24} = \\frac{2^9 \\cdot 3^3}{2^3 \\cdot 3} = 2^{9-3} \\cdot 3^{3-1} = 2^6 \\cdot 3^2 $$\nThis can be written as a perfect square:\n$$ f^2 = (2^3 \\cdot 3)^2 = (8 \\cdot 3)^2 = 24^2 $$\nSince the conductor $f$ must be a positive integer, we take the positive square root:\n$$ f = 24 $$\nThus, the integer $D = -13824$ is a discriminant with fundamental part $D_0 = -24$ and conductor $f=24$. The decomposition is $-13824 = -24 \\cdot 24^2$.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair $(D_0, f)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-24 & 24\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3085657"}, {"introduction": "Once the discriminant is understood, the next central task is to classify all the distinct types of forms that share it.

This requires enumerating the reduced forms, justifying that they represent all distinct proper equivalence classes, and finally determining the class number $h(-20)$.\n\nA primitive positive definite binary quadratic form is an expression $f(x,y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$ where $a, b, c$ are integers, $\\gcd(a, b, c) = 1$, $a > 0$, and the discriminant $D = b^2 - 4ac  0$.

It is a fundamental result in the theory of binary quadratic forms that every proper equivalence class of primitive positive definite forms contains exactly one reduced form. Therefore, the class number $h(D)$ is equal to the number of such reduced forms.\n\n**1. Enumeration of Reduced Forms**\n\nWe seek integer solutions $(a, b, c)$ to the equation $b^2 - 4ac = -20$ that satisfy the reduction conditions.\nThe discriminant equation can be rewritten as $4ac = b^2 + 20$. Since $a0$ and $c0$ for a positive definite form with $D0$, we must have $b^2+20  0$, which is always true.\nFrom the reduction condition $a \\leq c$, we have $4a^2 \\leq 4ac$. Substituting the discriminant equation gives $4a^2 \\leq b^2 + 20$.\nAnother reduction condition is $|b| \\leq a$, which implies $b^2 \\leq a^2$.\nCombining these inequalities, we obtain $4a^2 \\leq a^2 + 20$, which simplifies to $3a^2 \\leq 20$, or $a^2 \\leq \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.667$.\nSince $a$ must be a positive integer, the possible values for $a$ are $a=1$ and $a=2$.\n\nFurthermore, the equation $b^2 - 4ac = -20$ implies $b^2 = 4ac - 20 = 4(ac-5)$. This shows that $b^2$ must be a multiple of $4$, and therefore $b$ must be an even integer.\n\nWe now proceed with a case-by-case analysis.\n\nCase 1: $a=1$.\nThe condition $|b| \\leq a$ becomes $|b| \\leq 1$. As $b$ must be even, the only possibility is $b=0$.\nSubstituting $a=1$ and $b=0$ into the discriminant equation:\n$0^2 - 4(1)c = -20 \\implies -4c = -20 \\implies c=5$.\nWe have the form $(a,b,c) = (1,0,5)$. Let's check the reduction conditions:\n$|b| \\leq a \\implies |0| \\leq 1$, which is true.\n$a \\leq c \\implies 1 \\leq 5$, which is true.\nThe special conditions for $|b|=a$ or $a=c$ do not apply. Thus, the form is reduced.\nThe form is $f_1(x,y) = x^2 + 5y^2$. It is primitive since $\\gcd(1,0,5)=1$.\n\nCase 2: $a=2$.\nThe condition $|b| \\leq a$ becomes $|b| \\leq 2$. As $b$ must be even, the possible values for $b$ are $b=0$, $b=2$, and $b=-2$.\n\nSubcase 2a: $b=0$.\n$0^2 - 4(2)c = -20 \\implies -8c = -20 \\implies c = \\frac{20}{8} = \\frac{5}{2}$. This is not an integer, so no form exists in this subcase.\n\nSubcase 2b: $b=2$.\n$2^2 - 4(2)c = -20 \\implies 4 - 8c = -20 \\implies 8c = 24 \\implies c=3$.\nWe have the form $(a,b,c) = (2,2,3)$. Let's check the reduction conditions:\n$|b| \\leq a \\implies |2| \\leq 2$, which is true.\n$a \\leq c \\implies 2 \\leq 3$, which is true.\nWe have an equality $|b|=a$. The special condition requires $b \\geq 0$. Since $b=2$, this condition is satisfied. Thus, the form is reduced.\nThe form is $f_2(x,y) = 2x^2 + 2xy + 3y^2$. It is primitive since $\\gcd(2,2,3)=1$.\n\nSubcase 2c: $b=-2$.\n$(-2)^2 - 4(2)c = -20 \\implies 4 - 8c = -20 \\implies 8c=24 \\implies c=3$.\nWe have the form $(a,b,c) = (2,-2,3)$. Let's check the reduction conditions:\n$|b| \\leq a \\implies |-2| \\leq 2$, which is true.\n$a \\leq c \\implies 2 \\leq 3$, which is true.\nWe have an equality $|b|=a$. The special condition requires $b \\geq 0$. Since $b=-2$, this condition is violated. Thus, this form is not reduced.\n\nOur exhaustive search has yielded exactly two reduced primitive positive definite forms of discriminant $D=-20$:\n1. $f_1(x,y) = x^2 + 5y^2$\n2. $f_2(x,y) = 2x^2 + 2xy + 3y^2$\n\n**2. Justification via Genus Theory**\n\nThe theory of reduction of quadratic forms asserts a bijection between the set of proper equivalence classes and the set of reduced forms. Since we have found exactly two distinct reduced forms, there are exactly two proper equivalence classes for the discriminant $D=-20$.\n\nTo corroborate this result using genus theory, we first determine the number of genera for $D=-20$. A discriminant $D$ is fundamental if it is not of the form $D'k^2$ for some other discriminant $D'$ and integer $k1$. Equivalently, for $D0$, $D$ is fundamental if either $D \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ and is square-free, or $D=4m$ with $m \\equiv 2,3 \\pmod 4$ and $m$ is square-free. Here, $D=-20 = 4(-5)$. Since $m=-5$ is square-free and $-5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, $D=-20$ is a fundamental discriminant.\n\nFor a fundamental discriminant $D$, the number of genera, $g(D)$, is given by $g(D) = 2^{k-1}$, where $k$ is the number of distinct prime factors of $D$. The prime factors of $D=-20 = -1 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 5$ are $2$ and $5$. Thus, $k=2$.\nThe number of genera is $g(-20) = 2^{2-1} = 2$.\n\nThe set of all classes $C(D)$ is partitioned into $g(D)$ genera, and each genus contains the same number of classes, namely $|C(D)|/g(D) = h(D)/g(D)$.\nIn our case, there are two genera. This implies that the class number $h(-20)$ must be a multiple of $2$.\n\nThe genera are distinguished by a set of characters. For $D=-20$, the characters are determined by the prime factors of $D$. We have one odd prime factor, $p=5$, which gives the character $\\chi_5(n) = (\\frac{n}{5})$, where $(\\frac{\\cdot}{\\cdot})$ is the Legendre symbol. As $D/4 = -5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, there is an additional character, $\\chi_{-4}(m) = (-1)^{(m-1)/2}$ for an integer $m$ represented by a form. The values of these characters are constant for all integers $m$ coprime to $2D$ that can be represented by any form in a given genus.\n\nLet's evaluate the characters for the two reduced forms we found:\n\nFor $f_1(x,y) = x^2 + 5y^2$: This form represents $1$ (by setting $x=1, y=0$). We have $\\gcd(1, 2D) = \\gcd(1, -40) = 1$. The character values are:\n$\\chi_5(1) = (\\frac{1}{5}) = 1$.\n$\\chi_{-4}(1) = (-1)^{(1-1)/2} = (-1)^0 = 1$.\nThe character string for the genus of $f_1$ is $(1,1)$. This is the principal genus, which always contains the principal form (the identity element of the class group).\n\nFor $f_2(x,y) = 2x^2 + 2xy + 3y^2$: This form represents $c=3$ (by setting $x=0, y=1$). We have $\\gcd(3, 2D) = \\gcd(3, -40)=1$. The character values are:\n$\\chi_5(3) = (\\frac{3}{5}) = -1$.\n$\\chi_{-4}(3) = (-1)^{(3-1)/2} = (-1)^1 = -1$.\nThe character string for the genus of $f_2$ is $(-1,-1)$.\n\nSince the two forms $f_1$ and $f_2$ have different character strings, they belong to different genera. We have found two forms, and there are exactly two genera. This means each form represents a class in a distinct genus. Since our enumeration of reduced forms yielded only these two, it follows that each genus contains exactly one class.\n\nThis confirms that there are no other proper equivalence classes. The existence of two reduced forms, distributed one per genus across the two existing genera, provides a complete classification of the classes for $D=-20$.\n\n**3. The Class Number $h(-20)$**\n\nThe class number, $h(D)$, is the number of proper equivalence classes of primitive positive definite forms of discriminant $D$. As established by the enumeration of reduced forms, this number is $2$.\n$h(-20) = (\\text{number of reduced forms}) = 2$.\nThe analysis from genus theory confirms this: two genera exist, and we found one class in each, summing to a total of two classes. Therefore, $h(-20)=2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3085608"}, {"introduction": "The classification of forms into genera is not merely an abstract exercise; its true power lies in answering one of number theory's classic questions: which numbers can be written in a certain form?

The condition $|b| \\leq a \\leq c$ implies $b^{2} \\leq a^{2}$ and $a \\leq c$, so $a^{2} \\leq ac$.\nSubstituting into the discriminant equation: $4a^{2} \\leq 4ac = b^{2}+15$.\nSince $b^{2} \\leq a^{2}$, we have $4b^{2} \\leq 4a^{2} \\leq b^{2}+15$, which implies $3b^{2} \\leq 15$, or $b^{2} \\leq 5$.\nThe discriminant $D=-15$ is odd, so $b$ must be odd. The possible integer values for $b$ are therefore $b \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$.\nLet's analyze the cases for $b=1$.\n\nCase $b=1$:\n$4ac = 1^{2}+15 = 16$, so $ac=4$.\nThe reduction condition $|b| \\leq a \\leq c$ becomes $1 \\leq a \\leq c$.\nThe integer pairs $(a,c)$ satisfying $ac=4$ and $1 \\leq a \\leq c$ are $(1,4)$ and $(2,2)$.\n\n1.  For $(a,c)=(1,4)$, we get the form $f_1(x,y)=x^{2}+xy+4y^{2}$.\n    Lets check if it is reduced: $a=1, b=1, c=4$. We have $|1| \\leq 1 \\leq 4$, which is true.\n    Also, we have $|b|=a$. The condition requires $b \\geq 0$, which is true since $b=1$.\n    The form is primitive as $\\gcd(1,1,4)=1$.\n    This is a reduced form. Since $a=1$, this is the principal form, and its class is the identity in the class group.\n\n2.  For $(a,c)=(2,2)$, we get the form $f_2(x,y)=2x^{2}+xy+2y^{2}$.\n    Lets check if it is reduced: $a=2, b=1, c=2$. We have $|1| \\leq 2 \\leq 2$, which is true.\n    Also, we have $a=c$. The condition requires $b \\geq 0$, which is true since $b=1$.\n    The form is primitive as $\\gcd(2,1,2)=1$.\n    This is also a reduced form.\n\nIf we had considered $b=-1$, we would get the forms $x^{2}-xy+4y^{2}$ and $2x^{2}-xy+2y^{2}$. These are not reduced. For the first, $|b|=a=1$, and for the second, $a=c=2$. In both cases, the special reduction condition requires $b \\ge 0$, which is violated since $b=-1$. The reduction algorithm guarantees that any form is properly equivalent to exactly one reduced form, so these forms must be equivalent to the two we have already found, $f_1$ and $f_2$.\n\nThere are two reduced classes of primitive positive definite forms for $D=-15$. The class number is $h(-15)=2$. The class group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe principal class is the class of $f_1(x,y)=x^{2}+xy+4y^{2}$.\n\n**Part 2: Genus Theory and Class Assignment**\n\nFor a fundamental discriminant $D$, the number of genera is $2^{r-1}$, where $r$ is the number of distinct prime factors of $D$. Here $D=-15 = -3 \\cdot 5$. The distinct prime factors are $3$ and $5$. So $r=2$. The number of genera is $2^{2-1}=2$.\n\nThe genera are distinguished by the values of quadratic characters. For an odd prime $p \\nmid D$ represented by a form $f$, the genus characters for $D=-15$ are $\\chi_3(f) = (\\frac{p}{3})$ and $\\chi_5(f) = (\\frac{p}{5})$. The product of character values for any given genus must be $1$. The possible pairs of character values $(\\epsilon_3, \\epsilon_5)$ are therefore $(1,1)$ and $(-1,-1)$.\n\n-   **Genus 1 (Principal Genus)**: Characterized by $(\\chi_3, \\chi_5) = (1,1)$.\n    The principal form $f_1 = x^{2}+xy+4y^{2}$ belongs to the principal genus.\n    Let's verify this. If a prime $p$ is represented by $f_1$, $p=x^{2}+xy+4y^{2}$.\n    Modulo $3$: $p \\equiv x^{2}+xy+y^{2} \\equiv (x-y)^{2} \\pmod{3}$. Since $p \\nmid 3$, we have $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, so $(\\frac{p}{3})=1$.\n    Modulo $5$: $4p=4x^{2}+4xy+16y^{2}=(2x+y)^{2}+15y^{2} \\equiv (2x+y)^{2} \\pmod{5}$. Since $p \\nmid 5$, we have $4p$ is a quadratic residue mod $5$. As $(\\frac{4}{5})=1$, it means $(\\frac{p}{5})=1$.\n    So any prime represented by $f_1$ has characters $(1,1)$. The class of $f_1$ is in the principal genus.\n\n-   **Genus 2**: Characterized by $(\\chi_3, \\chi_5) = (-1,-1)$.\n    The other class, represented by $f_2 = 2x^{2}+xy+2y^{2}$, must belong to the other genus.\n    We can verify this by finding a prime represented by $f_2$. For $(x,y)=(3,-1)$, $f_2(3,-1)=2(9)+(-3)+2(1)=17$.\n    The characters are $\\chi_3(f_2) = (\\frac{17}{3}) = (\\frac{2}{3})=-1$ and $\\chi_5(f_2) = (\\frac{17}{5}) = (\\frac{2}{5})=-1$.\n    This confirms that the class of $f_2$ belongs to the genus with characters $(-1,-1)$.\n\n**Part 3: Congruence Conditions for Prime Representation**\n\nAn odd prime $p$ with $p \\nmid 15$ is represented by a form of discriminant $D=-15$ if and only if $(\\frac{D}{p})=(\\frac{-15}{p})=1$.\nUsing quadratic reciprocity: $(\\frac{-15}{p}) = (\\frac{-1}{p})(\\frac{3}{p})(\\frac{5}{p}) = (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\cdot (\\frac{p}{3})(-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\cdot (\\frac{p}{5}) = (\\frac{p}{3})(\\frac{p}{5})$.\nSo $p$ is represented if and only if $(\\frac{p}{3})$ and $(\\frac{p}{5})$ are either both $1$ or both $-1$. These two cases correspond to the two genera.\n\n-   **Principal Genus ($f_1$)**: Represents primes $p$ where $(\\frac{p}{3})=1$ and $(\\frac{p}{5})=1$.\n    - $(\\frac{p}{3})=1 \\implies p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\n    - $(\\frac{p}{5})=1 \\implies p \\equiv 1 \\text{ or } 4 \\pmod{5}$.\n    By the Chinese Remainder Theorem:\n    $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ and $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\implies p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{15}$.\n    $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ and $p \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5} \\implies p \\equiv 4 \\pmod{15}$.\n    Congruence conditions: $p \\equiv 1, 4 \\pmod{15}$.\n\n-   **Second Genus ($f_2$)**: Represents primes $p$ where $(\\frac{p}{3})=-1$ and $(\\frac{p}{5})=-1$.\n    - $(\\frac{p}{3})=-1 \\implies p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.\n    - $(\\frac{p}{5})=-1 \\implies p \\equiv 2 \\text{ or } 3 \\pmod{5}$.\n    By the Chinese Remainder Theorem:\n    $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ and $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\implies p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{15}$.\n    $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ and $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5} \\implies p \\equiv 8 \\pmod{15}$.\n    Congruence conditions: $p \\equiv 2, 8 \\pmod{15}$.\n\n**Part 4: List of Primes Represented by Each Genus**\n\nWe list odd primes $p \\leq 100$ with $p \\nmid 15$ (i.e., $p \\notin \\{2,3,5\\}$) and classify them.\n\n-   **Represented by the principal genus ($p \\equiv 1, 4 \\pmod{15}$)**:\n    - $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{15}$: $31, 61$.\n    - $p \\equiv 4 \\pmod{15}$: $19, 79$.\n    The set of primes is $\\{19, 31, 61, 79\\}$.\n\n-   **Represented by the second genus ($p \\equiv 2, 8 \\pmod{15}$)**:\n    - $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod{15}$: $17, 47$.\n    - $p \\equiv 8 \\pmod{15}$: $23, 53, 83$.\n    The set of primes is $\\{17, 23, 47, 53, 83\\}$.\n\nPrimes for which $(\\frac{-15}{p})=-1$ are not represented by any form of this discriminant. These are the remaining primes in the list, such as $7, 11, 13, \\dots, 97$. For example, for $p=7$, $(\\frac{7}{3})=1$ and $(\\frac{7}{5})=-1$, so $(\\frac{-15}{7})=-1$.\n\n**Part 5: Calculation of S**\n\nThe quantity $S$ is the sum of all odd primes $p \\leq 100$ with $p \\nmid 15$ that are represented by the principal genus. Using the list from Part 4:\n$S = 19 + 31 + 61 + 79$\n$S = 50 + 140$\n$S = 190$\nThe exact integer value is $190$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{190}$$", "id": "3085618"}]}
