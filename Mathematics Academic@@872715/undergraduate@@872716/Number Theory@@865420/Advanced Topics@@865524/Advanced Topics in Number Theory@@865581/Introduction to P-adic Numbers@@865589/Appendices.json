All definitions provided are standard in the theory of $p$-adic numbers. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. It poses a standard, non-trivial question that illustrates a fundamental difference between the real and $p$-adic topologies. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two distinct analyses of the sequence $\\{a_n\\}_{n \\geq 1}$ defined by $a_n := p^n$, where $p$ is a fixed prime number.\n\nFirst, we establish that the sequence is unbounded with respect to the usual absolute value $|\\cdot|$ on the field of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$.\nThe sequence of real numbers is given by $a_n = p^n$. Since $p$ is a prime number, we have $p \\geq 2$. The usual absolute value of $a_n$ is $|a_n| = |p^n| = p^n$, since $p^n$ is always positive. To show that the sequence $\\{p^n\\}_{n \\geq 1}$ is unbounded, we must show that for any positive real number $M$, there exists a natural number $N$ such that for all $n  N$, it holds that $a_n  M$.\n\nLet an arbitrary $M  0$ be given. We want to find an integer $n$ such that $p^n  M$. Since $p \\geq 2$, the logarithm function with base $p$, $\\log_p(x)$, is a strictly increasing function for $x0$. Applying this function to both sides of the inequality $p^n  M$ (assuming $M1$ for simplicity, the case $0M \\le 1$ is trivial as $p^n \\ge 2$ for $n \\ge 1$) preserves the inequality:\n$$ \\log_p(p^n)  \\log_p(M) $$\n$$ n  \\log_p(M) $$\nBy the Archimedean property of the real numbers, there exists a natural number $N$ such that $N  \\log_p(M)$. For any integer $n  N$, it follows that $n  N  \\log_p(M)$. Since the function $f(x)=p^x$ is also strictly increasing, this implies $p^n  p^{\\log_p(M)} = M$.\nTherefore, for any choice of $M  0$, we can find an $N$ (for instance, $N = \\max(1, \\lfloor \\log_p(M) \\rfloor)$) such that for all $n  N$, $a_n  M$. This confirms that the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is unbounded in the usual absolute value.\n\nSecond, we determine the limit of the sequence $\\{a_n\\}_{n \\geq 1}$ in the field of $p$-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_p$, with respect to the $p$-adic metric $d_p(x,y) = |x-y|_p$. We are looking for a value $L \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p$ such that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = L$. This is equivalent to showing that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} |a_n - L|_p = 0$.\n\nLet us propose that the limit is $L=0$. We must verify if $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} |a_n - 0|_p = 0$.\nThe term to evaluate is $|a_n|_p = |p^n|_p$.\nAccording to the problem's definition, for any nonzero rational number $x = p^k \\frac{a}{b}$ where $p \\nmid a$ and $p \\nmid b$, the $p$-adic valuation is $v_p(x) = k$.\nFor our sequence term $a_n = p^n$, we can write it in the required form as $p^n \\cdot \\frac{1}{1}$. Here, the exponent of $p$ is $k=n$, and we have $a=1$ and $b=1$. Since $p$ is a prime number, $p$ does not divide $1$. Thus, the conditions on $a$ and $b$ are satisfied.\nThe $p$-adic valuation of $a_n$ is therefore $v_p(a_n) = v_p(p^n) = n$.\n\nThe $p$-adic absolute value is defined as $|x|_p = p^{-v_p(x)}$. Applying this definition to $a_n$:\n$$ |a_n|_p = |p^n|_p = p^{-v_p(p^n)} = p^{-n} $$\nNow we need to determine if the sequence of real numbers $\\{|a_n|_p\\}_{n \\geq 1} = \\{p^{-n}\\}_{n \\geq 1}$ converges to $0$ as $n \\to \\infty$. This is a standard limit of a real-valued sequence.\n\nTo prove this formally using the provided definition of convergence, let an arbitrary $\\epsilon  0$ be given. We need to find a natural number $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all integers $n \\geq N$, we have $|a_n - 0|_p  \\epsilon$.\nSubstituting the expression for $|a_n|_p$, the condition is:\n$$ p^{-n}  \\epsilon $$\nWe can analyze this inequality in two cases based on the value of $\\epsilon$.\n\nCase 1: $\\epsilon \\geq 1$.\nSince $p$ is a prime, $p \\geq 2$. For any $n \\geq 1$, we have $p^n \\geq 2$, which implies $p^{-n} = \\frac{1}{p^n} \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, for any $n \\geq 1$, we have $p^{-n} \\leq \\frac{1}{2}  1 \\leq \\epsilon$. In this case, the inequality $p^{-n}  \\epsilon$ holds for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. We can simply choose $N=1$.\n\nCase 2: $0  \\epsilon  1$.\nThe inequality $p^{-n}  \\epsilon$ can be rewritten as $\\frac{1}{p^n}  \\epsilon$, which is equivalent to $p^n  \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$. Since $0  \\epsilon  1$, we have $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}  1$. As the logarithm function with base $p$ is a strictly increasing function, we can take the logarithm of both sides without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$ \\log_p(p^n)  \\log_p\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right) $$\n$$ n  \\log_p\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right) $$\nWe can choose $N$ to be any integer satisfying this condition for all subsequent $n$. A valid choice is $N = \\lfloor\\log_p(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})\\rfloor + 1$. Since $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}  1$, $\\log_p(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})  0$, which ensures that $N$ is a positive integer. For any $n \\geq N$, we have $n  \\log_p(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$, which implies $p^n  \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$, and thus $p^{-n}  \\epsilon$.\n\nIn both cases, for any given $\\epsilon  0$, we have found an $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \\geq N$, $|a_n - 0|_p  \\epsilon$. This satisfies the definition of convergence. Therefore, the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ converges to $0$ in $\\mathbb{Q}_p$.\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = 0 \\quad (\\text{in } \\mathbb{Q}_p) $$\nThis result highlights a striking contrast: the sequence of powers of $p$, which grows without bound in the real metric, converges to $0$ in the $p$-adic metric.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3086406"}, {"introduction": "Every non-zero $p$-adic number can be uniquely expressed in a form analogous to scientific notation, separating its magnitude (in the $p$-adic sense) from its \"unit\" component.

This shows $|x_{n+1}-x_n|_p \\to 0$.\nFor any $m  n$, the strong triangle inequality gives:\n$|x_m - x_n|_p = |(x_m-x_{m-1}) + \\dots + (x_{n+1}-x_n)|_p \\leq \\max_{k=n}^{m-1} |x_{k+1}-x_k|_p = \\max_{k=n}^{m-1} p^{-2^k} = p^{-2^n}$.\nSince $p^{-2^n} \\to 0$ as $n \\to \\infty$, the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence. Since $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a complete metric space, the sequence converges to a limit $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$.\nTaking the limit $n \\to \\infty$ in the recurrence for $x_n$, we get $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha + \\frac{1+p}{\\alpha})$, which simplifies to $2\\alpha^2 = \\alpha^2 + 1+p$, so $\\alpha^2 = 1+p$.\nSince $x_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ for all $n$, the limit $\\alpha$ must also satisfy this. Formally, $|x_n-1|_p \\le p^{-1}$ for all $n$, so $|\\alpha-1|_p = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} |x_n-1|_p \\le p^{-1}$, which means $\\alpha \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$.\nFor uniqueness, suppose $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ is another root such that $\\beta^2=1+p$ and $\\beta \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$. Then $\\alpha^2 = \\beta^2$, so $(\\alpha-\\beta)(\\alpha+\\beta)=0$. Since $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is an integral domain, either $\\alpha=\\beta$ or $\\alpha=-\\beta$. From the congruence conditions, $\\alpha \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ and $\\beta \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$, their sum is $\\alpha+\\beta \\equiv 2 \\pmod p$.

Then $x_n = \\alpha+e_n$.\nThe Newton iteration step for the error is:\n$$\ne_{n+1} = x_{n+1}-\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(x_n + \\frac{1+p}{x_n}\\right) - \\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\alpha+e_n + \\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\alpha+e_n}\\right) - \\alpha\n$$\n$$\ne_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2(\\alpha+e_n)} \\left( (\\alpha+e_n)^2 + \\alpha^2 - 2\\alpha(\\alpha+e_n) \\right)\n$$\n$$\ne_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2(\\alpha+e_n)} \\left( \\alpha^2+2\\alpha e_n+e_n^2 + \\alpha^2 - 2\\alpha^2-2\\alpha e_n \\right) = \\frac{e_n^2}{2(\\alpha+e_n)}\n$$\nSince $x_n = \\alpha+e_n$, the recurrence for the error in terms of $e_n$ and $x_n$ is $e_{n+1} = \\frac{e_n^2}{2x_n}$.\n\nTo find the closed-form expression for $|x_n-\\alpha|_p = |e_n|_p$, we take the $p$-adic absolute value:\n$$\n|e_{n+1}|_p = \\frac{|e_n|_p^2}{|2x_n|_p}\n$$\nAs established earlier, $|x_n|_p=1$ and $|2|_p=1$ (for $p$ odd), so $|2x_n|_p = |2|_p|x_n|_p = 1$. The recurrence simplifies to:\n$$\n|e_{n+1}|_p = |e_n|_p^2\n$$\nThis shows that the convergence is quadratic. To find the closed form, we need the initial error $|e_0|_p$.\n$e_0 = x_0-\\alpha = 1-\\alpha$.\nTo find $|1-\\alpha|_p$, we use the property $\\alpha \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$. We can write $\\alpha = 1+c$ where $v_p(c) \\geq 1$.\nSubstituting into $\\alpha^2 = 1+p$:\n$(1+c)^2 = 1+p \\implies 1+2c+c^2=1+p \\implies c(2+c)=p$.\nTaking valuations, $v_p(c) + v_p(2+c) = v_p(p) = 1$.\nSince $v_p(c) \\geq 1$, we have $c \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$. Thus, $2+c \\equiv 2 \\pmod p$.\nSince $p$ is an odd prime, $v_p(2)=0$, so $v_p(2+c)=0$.\nThe valuation equation becomes $v_p(c) + 0 = 1$, so $v_p(c)=1$.\nThe initial error is $e_0 = 1-\\alpha = -c$. Its absolute value is $|e_0|_p = |-c|_p = |c|_p = p^{-v_p(c)} = p^{-1}$.\nWe now solve the recurrence $|e_{n+1}|_p = |e_n|_p^2$ with $|e_0|_p = p^{-1}$.\nFor $n=1$: $|e_1|_p = |e_0|_p^2 = (p^{-1})^2 = p^{-2}$.\nFor $n=2$: $|e_2|_p = |e_1|_p^2 = (p^{-2})^2 = p^{-4}$.\nBy induction, assume $|e_k|_p = p^{-2^k}$. Then $|e_{k+1}|_p = |e_k|_p^2 = (p^{-2^k})^2 = p^{-2 \\cdot 2^k} = p^{-2^{k+1}}$.\nThe formula holds for all $n \\geq 0$.\n\nThe problem asks for $|x_n - \\sqrt{1+p}|_p$, where $\\sqrt{1+p}$ denotes the specific root $\\alpha$ we have constructed. Thus, the final expression is $|x_n - \\alpha|_p$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{p^{-2^n}}\n$$", "id": "3086429"}]}
