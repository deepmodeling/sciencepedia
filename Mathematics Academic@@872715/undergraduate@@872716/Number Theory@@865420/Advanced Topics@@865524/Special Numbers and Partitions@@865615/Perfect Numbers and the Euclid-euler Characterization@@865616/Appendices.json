It provides a clear set of tasks: to justify fundamental properties of the sum-of-divisors function $\\sigma(n)$ and then apply them to compute $\\sigma(496)$ and verify a specific property. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors.\n\nWe begin by addressing the two justifications requested, starting from foundational principles.\n\nFirst, we justify why the sum of divisors over a product of relatively prime integers factorizes into a product of sums over each factor. This property is known as multiplicativity. Let $\\sigma(n)$ be the function that sums all positive divisors of a positive integer $n$, defined as $\\sigma(n) = \\sum_{d|n} d$. Let $m$ and $n$ be two positive integers such that they are relatively prime, i.e., their greatest common divisor is $\\gcd(m, n) = 1$.\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, any integer greater than $1$ has a unique representation as a product of prime powers. Since $\\gcd(m, n) = 1$, the set of prime factors of $m$ and the set of prime factors of $n$ are disjoint. Let any divisor of $mn$ be denoted by $d$. The prime factors of $d$ must be a subset of the prime factors of $mn$. Because the prime factors of $m$ and $n$ are distinct, $d$ can be uniquely written as a product $d = d_1 d_2$, where $d_1$ is a divisor of $m$ and $d_2$ is a divisor of $n$. This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the set of divisors of $mn$ and the Cartesian product of the set of divisors of $m$ and the set of divisors of $n$.\n\nUsing this correspondence, the sum of the divisors of $mn$ can be expressed as:\n$$ \\sigma(mn) = \\sum_{d|mn} d = \\sum_{d_1|m, d_2|n} d_1 d_2 $$\nThis double summation can be factored due to the distributive property of multiplication over addition:\n$$ \\sum_{d_1|m, d_2|n} d_1 d_2 = \\left( \\sum_{d_1|m} d_1 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{d_2|n} d_2 \\right) $$\nBy the definition of the $\\sigma$ function, the two terms on the right are $\\sigma(m)$ and $\\sigma(n)$, respectively. Therefore, we have established that for any two relatively prime integers $m$ and $n$:\n$$ \\sigma(mn) = \\sigma(m)\\sigma(n) $$\n\nSecond, we justify why the sum of divisors of a prime power $p^k$ is the finite geometric sum $1 + p + p^2 + \\dots + p^k$. Let $p$ be a prime number and $k$ be a non-negative integer. A positive integer $d$ is a divisor of $p^k$ if and only if $d$ is of the form $p^j$ for some integer $j$ such that $0 \\le j \\le k$. This is because any prime factor of $d$ must also be a prime factor of $p^k$, and the only prime factor of $p^k$ is $p$. Furthermore, the exponent of $p$ in the prime factorization of $d$ cannot exceed $k$. Thus, the set of all positive divisors of $p^k$ is $\\{p^0, p^1, p^2, \\dots, p^k\\}$, which is equivalent to $\\{1, p, p^2, \\dots, p^k\\}$.\n\nThe sum of these divisors is, by definition, $\\sigma(p^k)$:\n$$ \\sigma(p^k) = 1 + p + p^2 + \\dots + p^k $$\nThis is a finite geometric series with $k+1$ terms, a first term of $1$, and a common ratio of $p$. The sum can be expressed in closed form as $\\frac{p^{k+1}-1}{p-1}$. The justification lies in the direct enumeration of all possible divisors.\n\nNow, we use these established facts to compute $\\sigma(496)$. First, we must find the prime factorization of the integer $496$:\n$$ 496 = 2 \\times 248 = 2^2 \\times 124 = 2^3 \\times 62 = 2^4 \\times 31 $$\nThe number $31$ is a prime number. Therefore, the prime factorization of $496$ is $2^4 \\cdot 31^1$.\n\nWe can now apply the multiplicative property of $\\sigma$ because the factors $2^4$ and $31$ are relatively prime ($\\gcd(16, 31) = 1$):\n$$ \\sigma(496) = \\sigma(2^4 \\cdot 31) = \\sigma(2^4) \\sigma(31) $$\n\nNext, we calculate the value of $\\sigma$ for each prime power factor using the geometric sum property:\nFor the factor $2^4$:\n$$ \\sigma(2^4) = 1 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31 $$\nFor the factor $31^1$:\n$$ \\sigma(31) = \\sigma(31^1) = 1 + 31 = 32 $$\n\nSubstituting these values back into the expression for $\\sigma(496)$:\n$$ \\sigma(496) = 31 \\times 32 $$\nThe product is calculated as:\n$$ 31 \\times 32 = 992 $$\nSo, the value of $\\sigma(496)$ is $992$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks to verify that this result equals $2 \\cdot 496$. We perform this calculation:\n$$ 2 \\cdot 496 = 992 $$\nOur computed value for $\\sigma(496)$ is indeed equal to $2 \\cdot 496$, which confirms that $496$ is a perfect number. The final answer required is the exact integer value of $\\sigma(496)$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{992} $$", "id": "3088038"}, {"introduction": "The Euclid-Euler theorem provides a remarkable recipe for generating all even perfect numbers.

A positive integer $N$ is defined as perfect if $\\sigma(N)=2N$, where $\\sigma(N)$ is the sum of the positive divisors of $N$. The deduction must utilize the multiplicativity of the $\\sigma$ function and the formula for a geometric series.\n\nFirst, we calculate the explicit integer value of $N$.\nThe number is given as $N=2^{p-1}(2^p-1)$ with $p=13$.\nThis gives $N = 2^{13-1}(2^{13}-1) = 2^{12}(8192-1)$.\nWe have $2^{12} = 4096$ and $2^{13}-1 = 8191$.\nTherefore, $N = 4096 \\cdot 8191$.\nThe multiplication can be performed as follows:\n$N = 2^{12}(2^{13}-1) = 2^{25} - 2^{12}$.\nWe compute the powers of $2$:\n$2^{10} = 1024$.\n$2^{12} = 2^2 \\cdot 2^{10} = 4 \\cdot 1024 = 4096$.\n$2^{25} = 2^5 \\cdot 2^{20} = 32 \\cdot (2^{10})^2 = 32 \\cdot (1024)^2 = 32 \\cdot 1048576 = 33554432$.\nSubtracting $2^{12}$ from $2^{25}$:\n$N = 33554432 - 4096 = 33550336$.\n\nNext, we must show that $N$ is a perfect number, i.e., $\\sigma(N) = 2N$.\nThe number is $N = 2^{12} \\cdot 8191$.\nWe are to use the property that the sum-of-divisors function, $\\sigma$, is a multiplicative function.

Therefore, $\\gcd(2^{12}, 8191) = 1$.\nThis allows us to write $\\sigma(N) = \\sigma(2^{12} \\cdot 8191) = \\sigma(2^{12})\\sigma(8191)$.\n\nWe compute each factor separately.\nFirst, we find $\\sigma(2^{12})$. The positive divisors of $2^{12}$ are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \\dots, 2^{12}$.\nThe sum of these divisors is a geometric series:\n$\\sigma(2^{12}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{12} 2^i = 2^0 + 2^1 + \\dots + 2^{12}$.\nUsing the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series, $\\sum_{i=0}^{k} r^i = \\frac{r^{k+1}-1}{r-1}$, with $r=2$ and $k=12$:\n$\\sigma(2^{12}) = \\frac{2^{12+1}-1}{2-1} = \\frac{2^{13}-1}{1} = 2^{13}-1$.\nSince $2^{13} = 8192$, we have $\\sigma(2^{12}) = 8192 - 1 = 8191$.\n\nSecond, we find $\\sigma(8191)$. The problem is an instance of the Euclid-Euler theorem, which generates perfect numbers of the form $2^{p-1}(2^p-1)$ whenever $2^p-1$ is a Mersenne prime. The problem is constructed with $p=13$, for which it is a well-tested fact of number theory that the Mersenne number $M_{13} = 2^{13}-1 = 8191$ is a prime number.\nIf a number $q$ is prime, its only positive divisors are $1$ and $q$.\nTherefore, the sum of its divisors is $\\sigma(q) = 1+q$.\nIn our case, with $q = 8191$:\n$\\sigma(8191) = 1 + 8191 = 8192$.\nWe can also express this as $8192 = 2^{13}$.\n\nNow, we combine these results to find $\\sigma(N)$:\n$\\sigma(N) = \\sigma(2^{12})\\sigma(8191) = (8191) \\cdot (8192)$.\n\nFinally, we verify if $\\sigma(N) = 2N$.\nWe have $N = 2^{12} \\cdot 8191$.\nSo, $2N = 2 \\cdot (2^{12} \\cdot 8191) = 2^{13} \\cdot 8191$.\nWe also know that $8192 = 2^{13}$.\nSubstituting this into our expression for $\\sigma(N)$:\n$\\sigma(N) = (8191) \\cdot (8192) = 8191 \\cdot 2^{13}$.\nComparing the expressions for $\\sigma(N)$ and $2N$:\n$\\sigma(N) = 2^{13} \\cdot 8191$\n$2N = 2^{13} \\cdot 8191$\nThey are identical.

Therefore, the integer $N$ is not a perfect number.\n\nAs directed, we can explain this conclusion by leveraging the fact that $1023$ is composite. The Euclid-Euler theorem provides a complete characterization of even perfect numbers. It states that an even integer is a perfect number if and only if it can be written in the form $2^{p-1}(2^p-1)$, where $p$ is a prime number and the second factor, $2^p-1$, is itself a prime (known as a Mersenne prime).\nThe number $N$ is given as $N = 2^9 \\cdot 1023$. We can write this as $N = 2^{10-1} \\cdot (2^{10}-1)$. This expression has the structure $2^{k-1}(2^k-1)$ with $k=10$. For $N$ to be perfect according to the Euclid-Euler theorem, two conditions must be met: first, the exponent $k$ (which is $10$ in this case) must be a prime number. Second, the factor $2^k-1$ (which is $1023$) must also be a prime number.\nNeither condition is met. The exponent $k=10$ is a composite number. Consequently, the factor $2^{10}-1 = 1023$ must also be composite, as confirmed by its factorization $1023 = 3 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 31$. Because the term $1023$ is composite, $N$ fails the test for being a perfect number.\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the exact integer value of the deviation from perfectness, $\\sigma(N) - 2N$. Using the expressions we derived:\n$$ \\sigma(N) - 2N = (1023 \\cdot 1536) - (1023 \\cdot 1024) $$\nWe can factor out the common term $1023$:\n$$ \\sigma(N) - 2N = 1023 \\cdot (1536 - 1024) $$\nThe difference in the parentheses is:\n$$ 1536 - 1024 = 512 $$\nSo the expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\sigma(N) - 2N = 1023 \\cdot 512 $$\nThis product can be computed as:\n$$ 1023 \\cdot 512 = (1024 - 1) \\cdot 512 = (1024 \\cdot 512) - (1 \\cdot 512) $$\nRecognizing that $1024 = 2^{10}$ and $512 = 2^9$:\n$$ 1024 \\cdot 512 = 2^{10} \\cdot 2^9 = 2^{19} $$\nThe value of $2^{19}$ is $2^{10} \\cdot 2^9 = 1024 \\cdot 512 = 524288$.\nTherefore, the final value is:\n$$ \\sigma(N) - 2N = 524288 - 512 = 523776 $$\nThe integer value of $\\sigma(N) - 2N$ is $523776$.
