It provides a clear task based on established mathematical definitions.\n\nThe absolute logarithmic Weil height $h(\\alpha)$ of an algebraic number $\\alpha$ belonging to a number field $K$ is defined via the places of $K$. Let $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = d$ be the degree of the field extension. Let $M_K$ be the set of places of $K$. For each place $v \\in M_K$, we associate a normalized absolute value $\\|\\cdot\\|_v$ and a local degree $d_v$. The set of places consists of archimedean (infinite) and non-archimedean (finite) places.\n\nThe standard normalizations are as follows:\n- For an archimedean place $v$ corresponding to a real embedding $\\sigma_i: K \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, we have $\\|\\alpha\\|_v = |\\sigma_i(\\alpha)|$ and the local degree is $d_v = [K_v:\\mathbb{Q}_\\infty] = [\\mathbb{R}:\\mathbb{R}] = 1$.\n- For an archimedean place $v$ corresponding to a pair of complex conjugate embeddings $\\sigma_i, \\bar{\\sigma}_i: K \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{C}$, we have $\\|\\alpha\\|_v = |\\sigma_i(\\alpha)|$ and the local degree is $d_v = [K_v:\\mathbb{Q}_\\infty] = [\\mathbb{C}:\\mathbb{R}] = 2$.\n- For a non-archimedean place $v$ corresponding to a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ of the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ lying over a rational prime $p$, we have $\\|\\alpha\\|_v = (N(\\mathfrak{p}))^{-\\text{ord}_\\mathfrak{p}(\\alpha)}$, where $N(\\mathfrak{p})$ is the norm of the ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ and $\\text{ord}_\\mathfrak{p}(\\alpha)$ is the exponent of $\\mathfrak{p}$ in the prime ideal factorization of the fractional ideal $(\\alpha)$. The local degree is $d_v = [K_v: \\mathbb{Q}_p] = e_\\mathfrak{p}f_\\mathfrak{p}$, where $e_\\mathfrak{p}$ is the ramification index and $f_\\mathfrak{p}$ is the residue field degree of $\\mathfrak{p}$ over $p$.\n\nThe absolute logarithmic Weil height is then given by the formula:\n$$h(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{v \\in M_K} d_v \\log\\max(1, \\|\\alpha\\|_v)$$\nA key property of this definition is that the value of $h(\\alpha)$ is independent of the number field $K$ chosen to contain $\\alpha$. We will demonstrate this.\n\nFirst, we analyze the specified number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe degree of the extension is $d = [K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$. The ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{2}]$.\nThe places of $K$ are:\n1.  **Archimedean places**: There are two real embeddings and no complex ones.\n    - $\\sigma_1: a+b\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto a+b\\sqrt{2}$. This defines a place $v_{\\infty,1}$ with local degree $d_{v_{\\infty,1}} = 1$.\n    - $\\sigma_2: a+b\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto a-b\\sqrt{2}$. This defines a place $v_{\\infty,2}$ with local degree $d_{v_{\\infty,2}} = 1$.\n    The sum of local degrees over the infinite place of $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $1+1=2$, which equals $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]$.\n2.  **Non-archimedean places**: These correspond to prime ideals of $\\mathcal{O}_K$. The numbers we must evaluate, $2$, $3$, and $\\sqrt{2}$, are all algebraic integers. For any algebraic integer $\\alpha$ and any non-archimedean place $v$ corresponding to a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$, we have $\\text{ord}_\\mathfrak{p}(\\alpha) \\ge 0$. This implies $\\|\\alpha\\|_v = (N(\\mathfrak{p}))^{-\\text{ord}_\\mathfrak{p}(\\alpha)} \\le 1$. Consequently, $\\log\\max(1, \\|\\alpha\\|_v) = \\log(1) = 0$. Therefore, for algebraic integers, only the archimedean places contribute to the height calculation. We will still show the analysis for completeness.\n\nWe now compute the heights for the given numbers.\n\n**1. Computation of $h(2)$**\nThe number $\\alpha = 2$ is in $K$.\n- **Archimedean contribution**:\n    - For $v_{\\infty,1}$: $\\|\\alpha\\|_{v_{\\infty,1}} = |\\sigma_1(2)| = |2| = 2$. The term is $d_{v_{\\infty,1}} \\log\\max(1, 2) = 1 \\cdot \\ln(2) = \\ln(2)$.\n    - For $v_{\\infty,2}$: $\\|\\alpha\\|_{v_{\\infty,2}} = |\\sigma_2(2)| = |2| = 2$. The term is $d_{v_{\\infty,2}} \\log\\max(1, 2) = 1 \\cdot \\ln(2) = \\ln(2)$.\n    - The total archimedean contribution is $\\ln(2) + \\ln(2) = 2\\ln(2)$.\n- **Non-archimedean contribution**:\n    We only need to consider places lying over the prime $p=2$. The prime $2$ ramifies in $\\mathcal{O}_K$: $(2) = (\\sqrt{2})^2$. Let $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (\\sqrt{2})$. Then $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2)=2$. The valuation of $2$ at $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is $\\text{ord}_{\\mathfrak{p}_2}(2) = 2$. The corresponding absolute value is $\\|2\\|_{\\mathfrak{p}_2} = (N(\\mathfrak{p}_2))^{-\\text{ord}_{\\mathfrak{p}_2}(2)} = 2^{-2} = \\frac{1}{4}$. Since $\\|2\\|_{\\mathfrak{p}_2}  1$, the term $\\log\\max(1, \\|2\\|_{\\mathfrak{p}_2}) = 0$. For all other finite places $v$, $\\|2\\|_v = 1$, so their contribution is also $0$. The total non-archimedean contribution is $0$.\n- **Total Height**:\n    $$h(2) = \\frac{1}{2} (2\\ln(2) + 0) = \\ln(2)$$\n\n**2. Computation of $h(3)$**\nThe number $\\alpha = 3$ is in $K$.\n- **Archimedean contribution**:\n    - For $v_{\\infty,1}$: $\\|\\alpha\\|_{v_{\\infty,1}} = |\\sigma_1(3)| = |3| = 3$. The term is $1 \\cdot \\ln(3) = \\ln(3)$.\n    - For $v_{\\infty,2}$: $\\|\\alpha\\|_{v_{\\infty,2}} = |\\sigma_2(3)| = |3| = 3$. The term is $1 \\cdot \\ln(3) = \\ln(3)$.\n    - The total archimedean contribution is $\\ln(3) + \\ln(3) = 2\\ln(3)$.\n- **Non-archimedean contribution**:\n    We consider places over $p=3$. In $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the prime $3$ is inert because the Legendre symbol $(\\frac{2}{3}) = -1$. The ideal $(3)$ is prime in $\\mathcal{O}_K$, let's call it $\\mathfrak{p}_3$. $N(\\mathfrak{p}_3) = 3^2 = 9$. We have $\\text{ord}_{\\mathfrak{p}_3}(3) = 1$. The absolute value is $\\|3\\|_{\\mathfrak{p}_3} = 9^{-1} = \\frac{1}{9}$. Since this is less than $1$, the contribution to the height is $0$. All other finite places give $0$.\n- **Total Height**:\n    $$h(3) = \\frac{1}{2} (2\\ln(3) + 0) = \\ln(3)$$\n\n**3. Computation of $h(\\sqrt{2})$**\nThe number $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2}$ is in $K$.\n- **Archimedean contribution**:\n    - For $v_{\\infty,1}$: $\\|\\alpha\\|_{v_{\\infty,1}} = |\\sigma_1(\\sqrt{2})| = |\\sqrt{2}| = \\sqrt{2}$. The term is $1 \\cdot \\ln(\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2)$.\n    - For $v_{\\infty,2}$: $\\|\\alpha\\|_{v_{\\infty,2}} = |\\sigma_2(\\sqrt{2})| = |-\\sqrt{2}| = \\sqrt{2}$. The term is $1 \\cdot \\ln(\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2)$.\n    - The total archimedean contribution is $\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2) + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2) = \\ln(2)$.\n- **Non-archimedean contribution**:\n    The only non-zero valuation is at the place over $p=2$, which is $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (\\sqrt{2})$. We have $\\text{ord}_{\\mathfrak{p}_2}(\\sqrt{2}) = 1$. The absolute value is $\\|\\sqrt{2}\\|_{\\mathfrak{p}_2} = (N(\\mathfrak{p}_2))^{-1} = 2^{-1} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since this is less than $1$, the contribution is $0$.\n- **Total Height**:\n    $$h(\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} (\\ln(2) + 0) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2)$$\n\n**Verification of Consistency**\nWe verify these results using the alternative definition of height via the minimal polynomial. For an algebraic number $\\alpha$ with minimal polynomial $P(x) = a_d x^d + \\dots + a_0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ (with $\\text{gcd}(a_0, \\dots, a_d)=1$ and $a_d0$), the height is given by\n$$h(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{d} \\log M(P)$$\nwhere $M(P)$ is the Mahler measure of $P$, defined as $M(P) = |a_d| \\prod_{i=1}^d \\max(1, |\\alpha_i|)$, and $\\alpha_i$ are the roots of $P(x)$.\n\n- For $\\alpha = 2$: The number is rational, so we can view it in $K=\\mathbb{Q}$. The minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Z}$ is $P(x) = x-2$. Here $d=1$, $a_1=1$, and the root is $\\alpha_1=2$.\n$M(P) = |1| \\cdot \\max(1, |2|) = 2$.\n$h(2) = \\frac{1}{1}\\ln(2) = \\ln(2)$. This matches our result.\n\n- For $\\alpha = 3$: The minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Z}$ is $P(x) = x-3$. Here $d=1$, $a_1=1$, and the root is $\\alpha_1=3$.\n$M(P) = |1| \\cdot \\max(1, |3|) = 3$.\n$h(3) = \\frac{1}{1}\\ln(3) = \\ln(3)$. This also matches.\n\n- For $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2}$: The minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Z}$ is $P(x) = x^2-2$. Here $d=2$, $a_2=1$. The roots are $\\alpha_1 = \\sqrt{2}$ and $\\alpha_2 = -\\sqrt{2}$.\n$M(P) = |1| \\cdot \\max(1, |\\sqrt{2}|) \\cdot \\max(1, |-\\sqrt{2}|) = 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 2$.\n$h(\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(M(P)) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2)$. This matches as well.\n\nThe calculations confirm that the absolute logarithmic Weil height is an intrinsic property of the algebraic number, independent of the field over which it is computed. The values are $h(2) = \\ln(2)$, $h(3)=\\ln(3)$, and $h(\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\ln(2)  \\ln(3)  \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3093643"}, {"introduction": "Roth's theorem makes a powerful, yet non-constructive, claim: for any algebraic irrational $\\alpha$ and any $\\varepsilon \\gt 0$, there are only finitely many rational approximations $p/q$ that are \"too good,\" i.e., satisfying $|\\alpha - p/q| \\lt q^{-2-\\varepsilon}$. This computational exercise brings this abstract assertion to life, challenging you to write a program that searches for these rare, exceptional approximations. By doing so, you can appreciate empirically just how few they are and gain a tangible sense of what an \"ineffective\" result means in practice [@problem_id:3093613].", "problem": "Let $\\alpha$ be a fixed algebraic irrational number, and let $\\varepsilon  0$ be a fixed real parameter. Recall the definition: a real number $\\alpha$ is algebraic irrational if it is a root of a nonzero polynomial with integer coefficients and is not rational. A rational approximation is a fraction $p/q$ with integers $p$ and $q \\ge 1$, and its absolute error is $|\\alpha - p/q|$. The fundamental base we use is the following: for each fixed denominator $q \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 1}$, the quantity $|\\alpha - p/q|$ is minimized over integers $p$ by choosing $p$ to be the nearest integer to $\\alpha q$ (i.e., $p$ that minimizes $|\\alpha q - p|$).

Multiplying the inequality by $q$ (which is positive) yields an equivalent form:\n$$\n|\\alpha q - p|  q^{-1-\\varepsilon}\n$$\nThis form is numerically more stable as it avoids the division by $q$ when calculating the error and also avoids having to compute $q$ raised to a negative power close to $-2$, which can be very small.\n\nThe algorithm to calculate $N(\\alpha, \\varepsilon, Q)$ for a given test case is as follows:\n\n1.

Calculate the right-hand side (RHS) of the transformed inequality: $\\text{RHS} = q^{-(1+\\varepsilon)}$.\n    d. Compare the two sides.

After the loop completes, the final value of `count` is the result $N(\\alpha, \\varepsilon, Q)$.\n\nThis process can be implemented efficiently using vectorized operations, for instance with the NumPy library. An array of all integers $q$ from $1$ to $Q$ can be created. Then, the corresponding arrays for $p$, the LHS, and the RHS can be computed in single vectorized steps. Finally, a vectorized comparison and sum can yield the total count.\n\nA crucial aspect of the implementation is numerical precision. For some test cases, particularly those involving numbers that are \"very irrational\" like the golden ratio $\\phi = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, the quantity $|\\alpha q - p|$ can become extremely small for large $q$. Standard double-precision floating-point numbers (`float64`) may not have sufficient precision to represent the product $\\alpha q$ accurately enough, leading to catastrophic cancellation when $p$ is subtracted.

We may proceed to a full solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the qualitative and quantitative differences in how well rational numbers can approximate two different classes of algebraic numbers: quadratic irrationals (algebraic numbers of degree $2$) and algebraic irrationals of degree at least $3$. The primary tools specified are the theory of continued fractions, Dirichlet's approximation theorem, and Roth's theorem.\n\nLet's summarize the key principles:\n1.  **Continued Fractions and Best Approximations**: For any irrational number $\\alpha$, its continued fraction convergents $p_n/q_n$ are its best rational approximations. The quality of approximation is given by the inequality $1/(q_n(q_{n+1}+q_n))  |\\alpha - p_n/q_n|  1/(q_n q_{n+1})$. Since $q_{n+1} = a_{n+1}q_n + q_{n-1}$, where $a_{n+1}$ is the ($n+1$)-th partial quotient, the magnitude of the partial quotients determines how well $\\alpha$ can be approximated.\n2.  **Quadratic Irrationals and Continued Fractions**: Lagrange's theorem states that a real number is a quadratic irrational if and only if its continued fraction expansion is periodic. A periodic sequence of partial quotients is necessarily a bounded sequence.\n3.  **Dirichlet's Approximation Theorem**: For any irrational number $\\alpha$, the inequality $|\\alpha - p/q|  1/q^2$ has infinitely many rational solutions $p/q$.\n4.  **Roth's Theorem**: For any algebraic irrational number $\\alpha$ and any real number $\\varepsilon  0$, the inequality $|\\alpha - p/q|  1/q^{2+\\varepsilon}$ has only a finite number of rational solutions $p/q$.\n\nWith these principles, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThis statement claims that for any quadratic irrational $\\alpha$, there exists a constant $c(\\alpha)  0$ such that for all rationals $p/q$, $|\\alpha - p/q|  c(\\alpha)/q^2$. Numbers with this property are called *badly approximable*.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ be a quadratic irrational. By Lagrange's theorem, its continued fraction is periodic. This implies that the sequence of its partial quotients, $\\{a_k\\}_{k\\ge 1}$, is bounded. Let $M$ be an upper bound, so $a_k \\le M$ for all $k \\ge 1$.\n\nLet $p_n/q_n$ be the $n$-th convergent of $\\alpha$. From the theory of continued fractions, we have:\n$$\n\\left|\\alpha - \\frac{p_n}{q_n}\\right|  \\frac{1}{q_n(q_{n+1}+q_n)}\n$$\nUsing the recurrence $q_{n+1} = a_{n+1}q_n + q_{n-1}$, we can write:\n$$\nq_{n+1} = a_{n+1}q_n + q_{n-1}  a_{n+1}q_n + q_n = (a_{n+1}+1)q_n\n$$\nSince $a_{n+1} \\le M$, we have $q_{n+1}  (M+1)q_n$.\nSubstituting this into the inequality for the approximation error:\n$$\n\\left|\\alpha - \\frac{p_n}{q_n}\\right|  \\frac{1}{q_n(q_{n+1}+q_n)}  \\frac{1}{q_n((M+1)q_n+q_n)} = \\frac{1}{(M+2)q_n^2}\n$$\nSo, for convergents $p_n/q_n$, the inequality holds with a constant like $1/(M+2)$.\n\nNow, consider any rational $p/q$ that is not a convergent of $\\alpha$. By a theorem of Legendre, if a rational number $p/q$ satisfies $|\\alpha - p/q|  1/(2q^2)$, then $p/q$ must be one of the convergents of $\\alpha$. Therefore, for any $p/q$ which is *not* a convergent, it must be the case that $|\\alpha - p/q| \\ge 1/(2q^2)$.\n\nWe can combine these two cases. For any rational $p/q$ (in lowest terms), either it is a convergent, in which case $|\\alpha - p/q|  \\frac{1}{(M+2)q^2}$, or it is not, in which case $|\\alpha - p/q| \\ge \\frac{1}{2q^2}$. We can thus choose a constant $c(\\alpha) = \\min(1/(M+2), 1/2)$, which is positive. The statement needs to hold for all $p/q$ with $q \\ge 1$. For the few cases with very small $q$ where the bound might not hold, we can adjust $c(\\alpha)$ by taking the minimum of its current value and $q^2|\\alpha - p/q|$ for those specific $p/q$. Since $\\alpha$ is irrational, $|\\alpha - p/q|$ is always non-zero, so this minimum will be positive. Therefore, such a constant $c(\\alpha)  0$ exists. The constant is explicit because the continued fraction of a quadratic irrational is periodic and can be computed, yielding the bound $M$.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThis statement claims that for any algebraic irrational $\\alpha$ of degree at least $3$ and any $\\varepsilon  0$, there exists a constant $c(\\alpha, \\varepsilon)  0$ such that $|\\alpha - p/q|  c(\\alpha, \\varepsilon)/q^{2+\\varepsilon}$ for all rationals $p/q$.\n\nThis is a direct restatement of Roth's theorem. The theorem states that for any algebraic irrational $\\alpha$ and any $\\varepsilon  0$, the inequality $|\\alpha - p/q|  1/q^{2+\\varepsilon}$ has only a finite number of solutions.\nLet this finite set of exceptional solutions be $S = \\{p_1/q_1, p_2/q_2, ..., p_k/q_k\\}$.\nFor any rational $p/q \\notin S$, the inequality from Roth's theorem is not satisfied, so we must have $|\\alpha - p/q| \\ge 1/q^{2+\\varepsilon}$. For such rationals, the statement holds with $c(\\alpha, \\varepsilon) = 1$.\nFor any exceptional solution $p_i/q_i \\in S$, we have $|\\alpha - p_i/q_i|  0$ since $\\alpha$ is irrational. Let's define $C_i = q_i^{2+\\varepsilon}|\\alpha - p_i/q_i|$. Each $C_i$ is a fixed positive number.\nNow, let $c(\\alpha, \\varepsilon) = \\min(1, C_1, C_2, ..., C_k)$. This constant is positive.\nWith this choice, for any $p/q$:\n- If $p/q \\notin S$, then $|\\alpha - p/q| \\ge 1/q^{2+\\varepsilon}  c(\\alpha, \\varepsilon)/q^{2+\\varepsilon}$.\n- If $p/q = p_i/q_i \\in S$, then $q_i^{2+\\varepsilon}|\\alpha - p_i/q_i| = C_i \\ge c(\\alpha, \\varepsilon)$, which means $|\\alpha - p_i/q_i| \\ge c(\\alpha, \\varepsilon)/q_i^{2+\\varepsilon}$.\nThus, the inequality $|\\alpha - p/q|  c(\\alpha, \\varepsilon)/q^{2+\\varepsilon}$ (or $\\ge$ in some cases, which does not change the validity of the statement for a suitably smaller positive constant) holds for all rational numbers $p/q$.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis statement claims that for any algebraic irrational $\\alpha$ of degree at least $3$, there exists a constant $c(\\alpha)  0$ such that $|\\alpha - p/q|  c(\\alpha)/q^2$ for all rationals $p/q$.\n\nThis is the definition of a badly approximable number. As established in the analysis of option A, this property holds for quadratic irrationals. The question is whether it holds for algebraic irrationals of degree $\\ge 3$.\nDirichlet's approximation theorem states that for *any* irrational number $\\alpha$, there are infinitely many rational approximations $p/q$ such that $|\\alpha - p/q|  1/q^2$.\nLet $\\{p_n/q_n\\}$ be an infinite sequence of such approximations. If statement C were true, we would have for this sequence:\n$$\n\\frac{c(\\alpha)}{q_n^2}  \\left|\\alpha - \\frac{p_n}{q_n}\\right|  \\frac{1}{q_n^2}\n$$\nThis implies $c(\\alpha)  1$, which is not a contradiction on its own. However, the set of badly approximable numbers is precisely the set of irrational numbers with bounded partial quotients in their continued fraction expansion. A fundamental theorem states that an irrational number has bounded partial quotients if and only if it is a quadratic irrational.\nTherefore, algebraic numbers of degree $\\ge 3$ do not have bounded partial quotients. For such numbers, the sequence of partial quotients $\\{a_k\\}$ is unbounded. This means we can find a subsequence of convergents $p_{n_j}/q_{n_j}$ such that the partial quotients $a_{n_j+1}$ tend to infinity. For these convergents, we have:\n$$\n\\left|\\alpha - \\frac{p_{n_j}}{q_{n_j}}\\right| \\approx \\frac{1}{a_{n_j+1}q_{n_j}^2}\n$$\nThis implies that the value of $q_{n_j}^2 |\\alpha - p_{n_j}/q_{n_j}|$ can be made arbitrarily close to $0$. The infimum of $q^2|\\alpha - p/q|$ over all integers $p, q$ with $q0$ is $0$.\nTherefore, it is impossible to find a constant $c(\\alpha)  0$ that satisfies the inequality for all $p/q$.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThis statement concerns the irrationality exponent $\\mu(\\alpha)$.\nThe first part claims $\\mu(\\alpha) = 2$ for quadratic irrationals.\nFrom Dirichlet's theorem, we know $\\mu(\\alpha) \\ge 2$ for any irrational $\\alpha$.\nFrom statement A, which we proved correct, for a quadratic irrational $\\alpha$, we have $|\\alpha - p/q|  c(\\alpha)/q^2$. This inequality implies that for any $\\delta  0$, the inequality $|\\alpha - p/q|  1/q^{2+\\delta}$ can only have a finite number of solutions. To see this, suppose it had infinitely many solutions. For large enough $q$, we would have $1/q^{2+\\delta}  c(\\alpha)/q^2$, or $q^\\delta  1/c(\\alpha)$, which would lead to a contradiction: $c(\\alpha)/q^2  |\\alpha - p/q|  1/q^{2+\\delta}$, which is impossible for large $q$. Thus, the supremum of exponents $\\mu$ for which $|\\alpha-p/q|1/q^\\mu$ has infinite solutions cannot be greater than $2$. Since it is at least $2$, it must be exactly $2$. So, $\\mu(\\alpha) = 2$ for quadratic irrationals. This part is correct.\n\nThe second part claims $\\mu(\\alpha)  2$ for algebraic irrationals of degree at least $3$.\nThis is false. As stated previously, Dirichlet's approximation theorem guarantees that $|\\alpha - p/q|  1/q^2$ has infinitely many solutions for *any* irrational number $\\alpha$, including algebraic irrationals of degree $\\ge 3$. By the definition of the irrationality exponent, this immediately implies that $\\mu(\\alpha) \\ge 2$. Therefore, the statement $\\mu(\\alpha)  2$ is incorrect. In fact, Roth's theorem shows that for any algebraic irrational $\\alpha$, $\\mu(\\alpha) \\le 2$. Combining this with Dirichlet's theorem, we conclude that $\\mu(\\alpha)=2$ for all algebraic irrationals.\n\nSince the second part of the statement is false, the entire statement is incorrect.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option E:**\nThis statement makes two claims about Roth's theorem.\nThe first claim is that Roth's theorem provides an \"effective (algorithmic) bound\". This is a well-known historical and mathematical point: the original proof of Roth's theorem is *ineffective*. An effective proof would provide a method to compute the constant $c(\\alpha, \\varepsilon)$ from statement B, or equivalently, to compute an upper bound on the denominators $q$ of the finite set of exceptional solutions. No such general method is known to follow from Roth's proof. Thus, the theorem is not effective.\n\nThe second claim is that it provides an \"explicit uniform lower bound on $|\\alpha - p/q|$ of order $q^{-2}$\". This is also false for multiple reasons.\n1.  As established in the analysis of C, a lower bound of order $q^{-2}$ (i.e., of the form $c/q^2$) does not exist for algebraic irrationals of degree $\\ge 3$.\n2.  Roth's theorem provides a lower bound of the form $c(\\alpha, \\varepsilon)/q^{2+\\varepsilon}$, not $c/q^2$. The exponent is different.\n3.  Since the theorem is ineffective, the constant $c(\\alpha, \\varepsilon)$ is not \"explicit\".\n\nBoth parts of the statement are fundamentally incorrect characterizations of Roth's theorem and its consequences.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nSummary of verdicts:\nA: Correct\nB: Correct\nC: Incorrect\nD: Incorrect\nE: Incorrect\n\nThe correct statements are A and B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "3093647"}]}
