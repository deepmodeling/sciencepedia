No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid as it is mathematically well-posed, scientifically grounded in the established principles of algebraic number theory, and contains no ambiguities, contradictions, or factual errors. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem asks for several related tasks concerning the quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$. We will address each in sequence.\n\nFirst, we determine the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ of the field $K$. A quadratic field is of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ where $d$ is a square-free integer. In our case, $d = -5$, which is square-free. The structure of the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ depends on the congruence of $d$ modulo $4$. The standard classification is as follows:\n- If $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, then $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}\\right]$.\n- If $d \\equiv 2$ or $d \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, then $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$.\n\nFor $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$, we have $d = -5$. We check the congruence: $-5 = -8 + 3 = 4(-2) + 3$. Thus, $-5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. According to the classification, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$. This means that the elements of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ are of the form $\\alpha = a + b\\sqrt{-5}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers ($a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$).\n\nNext, we derive the necessary and sufficient condition for an element of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ to be a unit. By definition, an element $u \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is a unit if it has a multiplicative inverse in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. That is, there exists an element $v \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ such that $uv = 1$.\n\nWe use the field norm $N: K \\to \\mathbb{Q}$. For an element $\\alpha = x + y\\sqrt{-5} \\in K$ (with $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$), the norm is defined as $N(\\alpha) = \\alpha \\bar{\\alpha}$, where $\\bar{\\alpha} = x - y\\sqrt{-5}$ is the conjugate of $\\alpha$.\n$N(\\alpha) = (x + y\\sqrt{-5})(x - y\\sqrt{-5}) = x^2 - (y\\sqrt{-5})^2 = x^2 - y^2(-5) = x^2 + 5y^2$.\nIf $\\alpha = a + b\\sqrt{-5}$ is an element of the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$, then $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, and its norm $N(\\alpha) = a^2 + 5b^2$ is also an integer.\n\nNow, we will show that an element $u \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is a unit if and only if its norm is $N(u) = \\pm 1$.\n\n($\\Rightarrow$) Assume $u \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is a unit. By definition, there exists $v \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ such that $uv = 1$. Applying the norm to both sides of this equation, we get $N(uv) = N(1)$. The norm is a multiplicative function, so $N(u)N(v) = N(1)$. The norm of $1 = 1 + 0\\sqrt{-5}$ is $N(1) = 1^2 + 5(0)^2 = 1$. Thus, we have the equation $N(u)N(v) = 1$. Since $u$ and $v$ are in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$, their norms, $N(u)$ and $N(v)$, are integers. The only way the product of two integers can be $1$ is if they are both $1$ or both $-1$. Therefore, it is necessary that $N(u) = \\pm 1$.\n\n($\\Leftarrow$) Assume $u \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is an element with norm $N(u) = \\pm 1$. The norm of $u$ is $N(u) = u\\bar{u}$. So, we have $u\\bar{u} = \\pm 1$. This equation implies that $u$ has a multiplicative inverse, specifically $\\pm\\bar{u}$. To show that $u$ is a unit in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$, we must verify that its inverse is also an element of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. Let $u = a + b\\sqrt{-5}$, where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Its conjugate is $\\bar{u} = a - b\\sqrt{-5}$. Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, $-b$ is also an integer. Thus, $\\bar{u}$ is of the form $a' + b'\\sqrt{-5}$ with $a', b' \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (specifically $a'=a, b'=-b$), which means $\\bar{u} \\in \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}] = \\mathcal{O}_{K}$. Consequently, the inverse of $u$, which is either $\\bar{u}$ or $-\\bar{u}$, is also in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. Therefore, $u$ is a unit.\n\nThis completes the derivation. An element $u = a+b\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is a unit if and only if $N(u) = a^2+5b^2 = \\pm 1$.\n\nNow, we identify all units of $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ by finding all integer solutions $(a, b)$ to the equation $a^2 + 5b^2 = \\pm 1$.\nSince $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $a^2 \\ge 0$ and $b^2 \\ge 0$. This implies that $a^2 + 5b^2 \\ge 0$. Hence, the case $a^2 + 5b^2 = -1$ is impossible. We only need to solve the Diophantine equation:\n$$a^2 + 5b^2 = 1$$\nWe analyze the possible integer values for $b$.\n- If $b=0$, the equation simplifies to $a^2 = 1$. The integer solutions for $a$ are $a=1$ and $a=-1$. This gives us two pairs of solutions: $(a, b) = (1, 0)$ and $(a, b) = (-1, 0)$.\nThese correspond to the elements $u_1 = 1 + 0\\sqrt{-5} = 1$ and $u_2 = -1 + 0\\sqrt{-5} = -1$.\n- If $b \\neq 0$, then $|b| \\ge 1$, which implies $b^2 \\ge 1$. In this case, $5b^2 \\ge 5$. Since $a^2 \\ge 0$, the left side of the equation is $a^2 + 5b^2 \\ge 0 + 5 = 5$. The equation $a^2 + 5b^2 = 1$ cannot be satisfied for any integer $a$. Therefore, there are no solutions when $b \\neq 0$.\n\nThe only integer solutions to the norm equation are $(1, 0)$ and $(-1, 0)$. This means that the only units in $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$ are $1$ and $-1$. Our list is complete because we have exhaustively considered all possible integer solutions to the unit condition equation.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the sum of all distinct units in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$.

It does not suffer from any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nWe first determine the structure of the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ for a real quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ where $D$ is a square-free integer. An element $\\alpha \\in K$ can be written as $\\alpha = u + v\\sqrt{D}$ for $u, v \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. For $\\alpha$ to be an algebraic integer, the coefficients of its minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ must be integers. The minimal polynomial is $m(x) = (x-\\alpha)(x-\\overline{\\alpha}) = x^2 - (\\alpha+\\overline{\\alpha})x + \\alpha\\overline{\\alpha}$. The coefficients are the trace $\\text{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = 2u$ and the norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = u^2 - Dv^2$.\n\nThus, we require:\n$1.$ $2u \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n$2.$ $u^2 - Dv^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nFrom condition $1$, let $2u = m$ for some integer $m$, so $u = \\frac{m}{2}$. Substituting this into condition $2$:\n$(\\frac{m}{2})^2 - Dv^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\implies \\frac{m^2}{4} - Dv^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nLet $v = \\frac{p}{q}$ with $p,q \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $q \\neq 0$, and $\\gcd(p,q)=1$. The condition becomes $\\frac{m^2}{4} - D\\frac{p^2}{q^2} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nMultiplying by $4q^2$ gives $m^2q^2 - 4Dp^2 = 4kq^2$ for some integer $k$. Rearranging, we have $4Dp^2 = q^2(m^2 - 4k)$, which shows that $q^2$ must divide $4Dp^2$. Since $\\gcd(p,q)=1$, we have $\\gcd(p^2,q^2)=1$, so $q^2$ must divide $4D$. As $D$ is square-free, the only square factors of $4D$ are $1$ and $4$. Hence, $q^2=1$ or $q^2=4$, which implies $q=1$ or $q=2$.\n\nCase A: $q=1$. Then $v=p \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Condition $2$ becomes $u^2 - Dp^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Since $Dp^2$ is an integer, we must have $u^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. With $u=m/2$, we need $(m/2)^2 = m^2/4 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. This implies $m$ must be an even integer, say $m=2n$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Then $u=n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. In this case, both $u$ and $v$ are integers, so $\\alpha = n + p\\sqrt{D} \\in \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{D}]$.\n\nCase B: $q=2$. Then $v=p/2$ where $p$ is an odd integer (otherwise, we could simplify the fraction and fall into Case A). For $\\alpha$ not to be in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{D}]$, $u=m/2$ must also have $m$ odd.\nThe condition $m^2 - 4Dv^2 = 4k$ becomes $m^2 - 4D(p/2)^2 = m^2 - Dp^2 = 4k$.\nThis requires $m^2 \\equiv Dp^2 \\pmod{4}$.\nSince $m$ and $p$ are both odd, $m^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ and $p^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\nThe congruence becomes $1 \\equiv D \\pmod{4}$.\n\nThis demonstrates that the ring of integers consists of elements with half-integer coordinates only if $D \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. If $D \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, Case B is impossible, and the ring of integers is simply $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{D}]$.\n\nFor the given problem, we have $D \\in \\{2,3\\}$.\nFor $D=2$, we have $2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$.\nFor $D=3$, we have $3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\nNeither $2$ nor $3$ is congruent to $1$ modulo $4$. Therefore, for $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$, the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{D}]$.\nThis proves that $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{2}]$ and $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{3}]$.\n\nNow, we derive the Pell-type equation. An element $\\varepsilon \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ is a unit if its norm is $\\pm 1$.\nFor $D \\in \\{2,3\\}$, an element $\\varepsilon \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ is of the form $\\varepsilon = x+y\\sqrt{D}$ for integers $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe norm is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\varepsilon) = (x+y\\sqrt{D})(x-y\\sqrt{D}) = x^2 - (y\\sqrt{D})^2 = x^2 - Dy^2$.\nThe condition for $\\varepsilon$ to be a unit is $x^2 - Dy^2 = \\pm 1$. This is the Pell-type equation characterizing the units in these rings.\n\nNext, we justify which sign can occur for each $D$.\nFor $D=2$, the equation is $x^2 - 2y^2 = \\pm 1$.\nThe equation $x^2 - 2y^2 = -1$ has the integer solution $(x,y)=(1,1)$, since $1^2 - 2(1^2) = 1-2 = -1$.\nThe equation $x^2 - 2y^2 = 1$ has the integer solution $(x,y)=(3,2)$, since $3^2 - 2(2^2) = 9-8 = 1$.\nThus, for $D=2$, both signs are possible.\n\nFor $D=3$, the equation is $x^2 - 3y^2 = \\pm 1$.\nLet's analyze the equation $x^2 - 3y^2 = -1$. We can consider this equation modulo $3$:\n$x^2 - 3y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod 3$.\nSo we need $x^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod 3$.\nThe squares modulo $3$ are $0^2 \\equiv 0$, $1^2 \\equiv 1$, and $2^2 \\equiv 4 \\equiv 1$.\nThe value $-1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $3$.\nTherefore, the equation $x^2 - 3y^2 = -1$ has no integer solutions.\nFor $D=3$, only the positive sign is possible, and the equation for units is $x^2 - 3y^2 = 1$.\n\nFinally, we determine the fundamental unit $\\varepsilon_D > 1$ for each case. The fundamental unit corresponds to the solution $(x,y)$ with the smallest positive integer $y$, and for that $y$, the smallest positive integer $x$.\n\nFor $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\nThe equation is $x^2 - 2y^2 = \\pm 1$. We seek the solution $(x,y)$ with minimal $y>0$.\nIf $y=1$: $x^2 - 2(1)^2 = \\pm 1 \\implies x^2 = 2 \\pm 1$.\nThis gives $x^2 = 3$ (no integer solution for $x$) or $x^2=1$.\nFor $x^2=1$, we take the positive solution $x=1$.\nThe minimal positive integer solution is $(x,y)=(1,1)$.\nThis corresponds to the fundamental unit $\\varepsilon_2 = 1 + 1\\sqrt{2} = 1+\\sqrt{2}$. This unit has norm $1^2 - 2(1^2) = -1$. Since $1+\\sqrt{2} \\approx 2.414 > 1$, this is the fundamental unit generating the infinite part of the unit group.\n\nFor $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$:\nThe equation is $x^2 - 3y^2 = 1$. We seek the solution $(x,y)$ with minimal $y>0$.\nIf $y=1$: $x^2 - 3(1)^2 = 1 \\implies x^2 = 4$.\nTaking the positive solution, we get $x=2$.\nThe minimal positive integer solution is $(x,y)=(2,1)$.\nThis corresponds to the fundamental unit $\\varepsilon_3 = 2 + 1\\sqrt{3} = 2+\\sqrt{3}$. This unit has norm $2^2 - 3(1^2) = 1$. Since $2+\\sqrt{3} \\approx 3.732 > 1$, this is the fundamental unit.\n\nThe two fundamental units are $\\varepsilon_2 = 1+\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\varepsilon_3 = 2+\\sqrt{3}$.\nWe present these in a single row matrix as requested.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1+\\sqrt{2}  2+\\sqrt{3}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3093863"}, {"introduction": "This comprehensive problem challenges you to synthesize your skills by investigating units across a variety of quadratic fields, both real and imaginary.

Determination of the Rings of Integers $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$**\n\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ where $d$ is a square-free integer. An element $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{d} \\in K$ with $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ is an algebraic integer if and only if its minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is $x^2 - \\operatorname{Tr}(\\alpha)x + N(\\alpha)$, has integer coefficients. This is equivalent to requiring that its trace and norm are integers:\n$\\operatorname{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = 2a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = a^2 - db^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nLet $2a = m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, so $a = m/2$. Substituting this into the norm condition gives:\n$(\\frac{m}{2})^2 - db^2 = k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$\\frac{m^2}{4} - db^2 = k \\implies m^2 - 4db^2 = 4k$.\nThis implies $4db^2 = m^2 - 4k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Let $b = p/q$ where $p,q \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ with $\\gcd(p,q)=1$. Then $4dp^2/q^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, which implies $q^2 | 4dp^2$. Since $\\gcd(p,q)=1$, we must have $q^2 | 4d$. As $d$ is square-free, any square factor of $4d$ must divide $4$. Thus $q^2 \\in \\{1, 4\\}$, which means $q \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. So, $b$ must be an integer or a half-integer.\n\nLet $2b = n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, so $b=n/2$. The element $\\alpha$ must be of the form $\\frac{m+n\\sqrt{d}}{2}$ for integers $m,n$. The norm condition becomes:\n$N(\\alpha) = \\frac{m^2 - dn^2}{4} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, which requires $m^2 - dn^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n\n- If $d \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ (i.e., $d \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$), then:\n    - If $n$ is even ($n=2j$), then $n^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$. The condition becomes $m^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, so $m$ must be even ($m=2i$). This means $\\alpha = \\frac{2i+2j\\sqrt{d}}{2} = i+j\\sqrt{d}$ with $i,j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    - If $n$ is odd ($n^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$), the condition is $m^2-d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$. If $m$ is even, $-d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, which is impossible for square-free $d$. If $m$ is odd, $1-d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, so $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, which contradicts our assumption.\n    Thus, for $d \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$, both $m$ and $n$ must be even, so $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$.\n- If $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$:\n    - The condition is $m^2 - n^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$. This holds if and only if $m$ and $n$ have the same parity.\n    - If $m,n$ are both even, we get elements of $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$.\n    - If $m,n$ are both odd, we get elements of the form $\\frac{m+n\\sqrt{d}}{2}$. All such elements can be written as integer linear combinations of $1$ and $\\omega = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}$. Indeed, $\\frac{m+n\\sqrt{d}}{2} = \\frac{m-n}{2} + n(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2})$, and since $m,n$ are odd, $m-n$ is even, so $\\frac{m-n}{2} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Thus, for $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}]$.\n\nApplying this to the given fields:\n- $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$: $d=2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, so $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{2}]$.\n- $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$: $d=3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, so $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{3}]$.\n- $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$: $d=5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, so $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}]$.\n- $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$: $d=-1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, so $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-1}] = \\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n- $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$: $d=-3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, so $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-3}}{2}]$.\n- $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$: $d=-5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, so $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$.\n\n**2. Determination of the Fundamental Units**\n\nA unit $\\epsilon \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ must satisfy $|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\epsilon)| = 1$. For real quadratic fields, we seek the smallest unit $\\epsilon > 1$, which is the fundamental unit.\n\n- **For $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:** The ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{2}]$. We seek integer solutions $(x,y)$ to the Pell's equation $x^2 - 2y^2 = \\pm 1$. We search for the solution with the smallest positive $x, y$.\n  For $y=1$, $x^2 - 2 = \\pm 1$. This gives $x^2 = 3$ (no integer solution) or $x^2 = 1$. Taking $x>0$, we get $x=1$. The minimal solution is $(x,y)=(1,1)$.\n  This yields the unit $\\epsilon = 1+1\\sqrt{2} = 1+\\sqrt{2}$. Since $1+\\sqrt{2} > 1$, this is the fundamental unit.\n  $\\epsilon_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})} = 1+\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n- **For $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$:** The ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{3}]$. We seek integer solutions $(x,y)$ to $x^2 - 3y^2 = \\pm 1$.\n  For $y=1$, $x^2 - 3 = \\pm 1$. This gives $x^2 = 4$ or $x^2=2$. The only integer solution is $x=2$ (for $x>0$). The minimal solution is $(x,y)=(2,1)$.\n  This yields the unit $\\epsilon = 2+1\\sqrt{3} = 2+\\sqrt{3}$. Since $2+\\sqrt{3} > 1$, this is the fundamental unit.\n  $\\epsilon_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})} = 2+\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n- **For $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$:** The ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}]$. An element is of the form $\\frac{x+y\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ have the same parity ($x \\equiv y \\pmod 2$). The norm condition is $N(\\frac{x+y\\sqrt{5}}{2}) = \\frac{x^2-5y^2}{4} = \\pm 1$, which leads to the equation $x^2 - 5y^2 = \\pm 4$. We seek the solution $(x,y)$ with $x,y>0$ ($x \\equiv y \\pmod 2$) that minimizes $\\frac{x+y\\sqrt{5}}{2} > 1$.\n  For $y=1$, $x^2 - 5 = \\pm 4$. This gives $x^2 = 9$ or $x^2=1$.\n  - $x^2=1 \\implies x=1$. The pair $(x,y)=(1,1)$ satisfies $x \\equiv y \\pmod 2$. This gives the unit $\\epsilon = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\n  - $x^2=9 \\implies x=3$. The pair $(x,y)=(3,1)$ satisfies $x \\equiv y \\pmod 2$. This gives the unit $\\epsilon = \\frac{3+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\n  Comparing the two units greater than $1$: $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\approx 1.618$ and $\\frac{3+\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\approx 2.618$. The smaller one is $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. This is the fundamental unit.\n  $\\epsilon_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})} = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\n\n**3. Computation of $U$**\n\nThe quantity $U$ is the product of the fundamental units determined above:\n$$U = \\epsilon_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}\\,\\epsilon_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})}\\,\\epsilon_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})} = (1+\\sqrt{2})(2+\\sqrt{3})\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)$$\nWe compute the product step by step. First, multiply the first two factors:\n$$(1+\\sqrt{2})(2+\\sqrt{3}) = 1(2+\\sqrt{3}) + \\sqrt{2}(2+\\sqrt{3}) = 2 + \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{6}$$\nNext, multiply this result by the third factor:\n$$U = (2 + 2\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6})\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)$$\n$$U = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (2 + 2\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6}) \\cdot 1 + (2 + 2\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6}) \\cdot \\sqrt{5} \\right]$$\n$$U = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 2 + 2\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6} + 2\\sqrt{5} + 2\\sqrt{10} + \\sqrt{15} + \\sqrt{30} \\right]$$\nThis expression contains terms with eight distinct square-free radicands ($2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30$) and a rational part. No further simplification is possible. This is the simplest radical form.\n\nTo present the final answer as a single expression, we write:\n$$U = \\frac{2 + 2\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{6} + 2\\sqrt{10} + \\sqrt{15} + \\sqrt{30}}{2}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2 + 2\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6} + 2\\sqrt{5} + 2\\sqrt{10} + \\sqrt{15} + \\sqrt{30}}{2}}$$", "id": "3093834"}]}
