We seek $q$ and $r$ satisfying $\\alpha = \\beta q + r$ and $N(r)  N(\\beta)$. The standard procedure is to first compute the quotient $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}$ in the field of fractions $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$.\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} = \\frac{7+5i}{3-2i}\n$$\n\nTo perform this division, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is $3+2i$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{7+5i}{3-2i} = \\frac{(7+5i)(3+2i)}{(3-2i)(3+2i)}\n$$\n\nWe compute the numerator and the denominator separately.\nThe numerator is:\n$$\n(7+5i)(3+2i) = 7(3) + 7(2i) + 5i(3) + 5i(2i) = 21 + 14i + 15i + 10i^2\n$$\nSince $i^2 = -1$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n21 + 29i - 10 = 11+29i\n$$\nThe denominator is the norm of $3-2i$:\n$$\n(3-2i)(3+2i) = 3^2 - (2i)^2 = 9 - 4i^2 = 9 - 4(-1) = 9+4 = 13\n$$\nThis is also $N(3-2i) = 3^2 + (-2)^2 = 13$.\n\nSo, the quotient in $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} = \\frac{11+29i}{13} = \\frac{11}{13} + \\frac{29}{13}i\n$$\n\nThe next step is to find a Gaussian integer $q = x+yi$ (with $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$) that is \"closest\" to this complex number.
