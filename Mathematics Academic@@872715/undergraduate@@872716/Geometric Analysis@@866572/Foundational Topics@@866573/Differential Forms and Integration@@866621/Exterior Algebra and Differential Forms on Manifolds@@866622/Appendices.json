It is a well-posed, standard problem in an established area of mathematics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested: computing the exterior derivative $d\\omega$, evaluating the integral of $d\\omega$ over the square $S$, and evaluating the integral of $\\omega$ over the boundary $\\partial S$.\n\n**Part 1: Computation of the Exterior Derivative $d\\omega$**\nThe given 1-form is $\\omega = x y \\, dx$. We can write this as $\\omega = f(x,y) \\, dx + g(x,y) \\, dy$ where $f(x,y) = xy$ and $g(x,y) = 0$.\nThe exterior derivative of a 1-form is defined as:\n$$d\\omega = d(f \\, dx + g \\, dy) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} dy \\wedge dx + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} dx \\wedge dy$$\nSubstituting our functions $f$ and $g$:\n$$d\\omega = \\frac{\\partial(xy)}{\\partial y} dy \\wedge dx + \\frac{\\partial(0)}{\\partial x} dx \\wedge dy$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial(xy)}{\\partial y} = x$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial(0)}{\\partial x} = 0$$\nSo, the exterior derivative is:\n$$d\\omega = x \\, dy \\wedge dx + 0 \\cdot dx \\wedge dy = x \\, dy \\wedge dx$$\nUsing the anti-commutative property of the wedge product, $dy \\wedge dx = -dx \\wedge dy$, we can express $d\\omega$ in terms of the standard orientation form $dx \\wedge dy$:\n$$d\\omega = -x \\, dx \\wedge dy$$\n\n**Part 2: Evaluation of the Integral $\\int_S d\\omega$**\nWe need to integrate the 2-form $d\\omega = -x \\, dx \\wedge dy$ over the unit square $S = [0,1]^2$. The integral of a 2-form $h(x,y) \\, dx \\wedge dy$ over a region in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is equivalent to the standard double integral of the function $h(x,y)$ over that region.\n$$\\int_S d\\omega = \\iint_S (-x) \\, dx \\, dy$$\nThe region of integration is $S = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid 0 \\le x \\le 1, 0 \\le y \\le 1\\}$. We can evaluate this using an iterated integral:\n$$\\int_S d\\omega = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} -x \\, dx \\right) dy$$\nFirst, we compute the inner integral with respect to $x$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{1} -x \\, dx = \\left[ -\\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{1} = -\\frac{1^2}{2} - \\left(-\\frac{0^2}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2}$$\nNow, we substitute this result into the outer integral with respect to $y$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{1} \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\right) dy = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2}y \\right]_{0}^{1} = -\\frac{1}{2}(1) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(0)\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2}$$\nThus, the value of the integral is:\n$$\\int_S d\\omega = -\\frac{1}{2}$$\n\n**Part 3: Evaluation of the Integral $\\int_{\\partial S} \\omega$**\nThe boundary $\\partial S$ of the unit square consists of four line segments. The positive orientation (counterclockwise) means we traverse the boundary from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$, then to $(1,1)$, then to $(0,1)$, and finally back to $(0,0)$. Let's denote these segments as $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4$. The total integral is the sum of the integrals over these four segments:\n$$\\int_{\\partial S} \\omega = \\int_{C_1} \\omega + \\int_{C_2} \\omega + \\int_{C_3} \\omega + \\int_{C_4} \\omega$$\nThe form is $\\omega = xy \\, dx$.\n\n-   **Segment $C_1$**: From $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$.\n    We can parametrize this path as $\\gamma_1(t) = (t, 0)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\n    Here, $x = t$ and $y = 0$.

This implies $dx = 0 \\, dt = 0$.\n    Since $\\omega$ is proportional to $dx$, its pullback is $\\gamma_2^*\\omega = (1)(t) \\cdot (0) = 0$.\n    The integral is $\\int_{C_2} \\omega = \\int_{0}^{1} 0 \\, dt = 0$.\n\n-   **Segment $C_3$**: From $(1,1)$ to $(0,1)$.\n    We can parametrize this path as $\\gamma_3(t) = (1-t, 1)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\n    Here, $x = 1-t$ and $y = 1$. This implies $dx = -dt$.\n    The pullback of $\\omega$ is $\\gamma_3^*\\omega = (1-t)(1) \\, (-dt) = (t-1) \\, dt$.\n    The integral is $\\int_{C_3} \\omega = \\int_{0}^{1} (t-1) \\, dt = \\left[ \\frac{t^2}{2} - t \\right]_{0}^{1} = \\left(\\frac{1^2}{2} - 1\\right) - (0-0) = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n-   **Segment $C_4$**: From $(0,1)$ to $(0,0)$.\n    We can parametrize this path as $\\gamma_4(t) = (0, 1-t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\n    Here, $x = 0$ and $y = 1-t$.

The values are identical. This result is an illustration of the general Stokes' theorem for manifolds with boundary, which states that for any smooth $(k-1)$-form $\\alpha$ on an oriented $k$-dimensional manifold $M$ with boundary $\\partial M$, the following identity holds:\n$$\\int_M d\\alpha = \\int_{\\partial M} \\alpha$$\nIn our specific problem, $M=S$ is a 2-dimensional manifold, and $\\alpha=\\omega$ is a 1-form, so the theorem correctly predicts that $\\int_S d\\omega = \\int_{\\partial S} \\omega$. Our direct calculations for this specific case are compatible with this fundamental principle.\n\nThe common exact value of these two integrals is $-\\frac{1}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "3048370"}, {"introduction": "After seeing how the exterior derivative $d$ acts on a form, a natural question arises: can we reverse the process?

The manifold $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is contractible, and the function $f(x,y)$ is smooth. The core of the problem lies in an application of the Poincaré Lemma.\n\nThe problem is well-posed and objective. However, a critical examination of the statement about uniqueness is warranted. If $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ are two 1-forms satisfying the conditions, then $d(\\alpha_1 - \\alpha_2) = d\\alpha_1 - d\\alpha_2 = \\omega - \\omega = 0$. Since $\\alpha_1 - \\alpha_2$ is a closed 1-form on the contractible manifold $\\mathbb{R}^2$, it must be exact. Thus, there exists a smooth function $g: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\alpha_1 - \\alpha_2 = dg$. The normalization condition implies $(\\alpha_1 - \\alpha_2)|_{\\{x=0\\}} = 0 - 0 = 0$, so $dg|_{\\{x=0\\}} = 0$. This means $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}(0,y) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}(0,y) = 0$ for all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. While this restricts $g$, it does not force $g$ to be a constant function (for which $dg=0$). For example, $g(x,y) = x^2$ satisfies these conditions, but $dg = 2x\\,dx$ is not the zero 1-form. Thus, uniqueness is not guaranteed in the most general sense.\n\nHowever, the problem structure strongly suggests employing a specific, canonical construction for the potential form $\\alpha$ that is naturally compatible with the given normalization. This construction, a standard method for proving the Poincaré Lemma, does yield a unique result. The phrase \"to fix uniqueness\" can be interpreted as a directive to use this specific construction, under which uniqueness is indeed achieved. With this interpretation, the problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid under the interpretation that a canonical construction is to be used. We proceed to the solution.\n\nFirst, we establish the existence of such a 1-form $\\alpha$. The manifold is $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which is a contractible space. The given form $\\omega$ is a 2-form on a 2-dimensional manifold. Any such form is necessarily closed, because its exterior derivative $d\\omega$ would be a 3-form, and the space of 3-forms on a 2-dimensional manifold is trivial. According to the Poincaré Lemma (the \"basic fact\" mentioned in the problem), every closed differential form on a contractible manifold is exact. Therefore, $\\omega$ is an exact form, which implies the existence of at least one 1-form $\\alpha$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $d\\alpha = \\omega$.\n\nNext, we determine the explicit form of $\\alpha$. Let the 1-form be $\\alpha = A(x,y)\\,dx + B(x,y)\\,dy$ for some smooth functions $A$ and $B$. Its exterior derivative is $d\\alpha = (\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial y})\\,dx \\wedge dy$. Setting this equal to $\\omega$ gives the partial differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial y} = y \\cos(x) + 3 x^{2} y^{2} $$\nThe normalization condition $\\alpha|_{\\{x=0\\}} = 0$ translates to the boundary conditions:\n$$ A(0,y) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad B(0,y) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } y \\in \\mathbb{R} $$\nThe construction suggested by the normalization on the line $x=0$ is to integrate from this line. This is equivalent to seeking a solution where the $dx$ component is zero, i.e., of the form $\\alpha = B(x,y)\\,dy$. This choice immediately sets $A(x,y) = 0$ for all $(x,y)$, which satisfies the condition $A(0,y) = 0$.\n\nWith $A(x,y) = 0$, the partial differential equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial x} = y \\cos(x) + 3 x^{2} y^{2} $$\nWe can solve for $B(x,y)$ by integrating with respect to $x$. To incorporate the boundary condition $B(0,y)=0$, we perform a definite integration from $s=0$ to $s=x$:\n$$ B(x,y) - B(0,y) = \\int_{0}^{x} \\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial s}(s,y) \\,ds $$\n$$ B(x,y) - 0 = \\int_{0}^{x} (y \\cos(s) + 3 s^{2} y^{2}) \\,ds $$\nWe now evaluate the integral:\n$$ B(x,y) = y \\int_{0}^{x} \\cos(s) \\,ds + 3y^2 \\int_{0}^{x} s^2 \\,ds $$\n$$ B(x,y) = y [\\sin(s)]_{s=0}^{s=x} + 3y^2 \\left[\\frac{s^3}{3}\\right]_{s=0}^{s=x} $$\n$$ B(x,y) = y (\\sin(x) - \\sin(0)) + y^2 (x^3 - 0^3) $$\n$$ B(x,y) = y \\sin(x) + x^3 y^2 $$\nThus, we have found the unique functions $A(x,y)=0$ and $B(x,y)=y \\sin(x) + x^3 y^2$ that satisfy the problem's requirements under this canonical construction. The resulting 1-form is:\n$$ \\alpha = 0 \\cdot dx + (y \\sin(x) + x^3 y^2) dy $$\n$$ \\alpha = (y \\sin(x) + x^3 y^2) dy $$\nThis solution satisfies $d\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(y \\sin(x) + x^3 y^2) dx \\wedge dy = (y \\cos(x) + 3x^2y^2) dx \\wedge dy = \\omega$, and $\\alpha(0,y) = (y \\sin(0) + 0^3 y^2) dy = 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(y \\sin(x) + x^{3} y^{2}) dy}$$", "id": "3048388"}, {"introduction": "The previous exercise showed that on a simple space like $\\mathbb{R}^2$, a form being closed is sufficient for it to be exact.
