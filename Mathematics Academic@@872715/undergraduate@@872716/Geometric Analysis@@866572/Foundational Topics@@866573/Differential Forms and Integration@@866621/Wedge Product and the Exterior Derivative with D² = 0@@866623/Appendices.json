For our $1$-form $\\alpha$, it would be exact if there existed a $0$-form (a scalar function) $h(x, y)$ such that $\\alpha = dh$.\n\nIf $\\alpha$ were exact on $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$, then by the generalized Stokes' theorem, the integral of $\\alpha$ over any closed curve $C$ in the domain must be zero. Let's test this by integrating $\\alpha$ over the unit circle $C$ centered at the origin, which lies entirely within $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$. We can parameterize $C$ by $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t)$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\nOn this curve, we have $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$. The differentials are $dx = -\\sin t \\, dt$ and $dy = \\cos t \\, dt$. Also, $x^2+y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$.\nThe pullback of $\\alpha$ to the curve $C$ is:\n$$\n\\gamma^*\\alpha = \\frac{-\\sin t}{1}(-\\sin t \\, dt) + \\frac{\\cos t}{1}(\\cos t \\, dt) = (\\sin^2 t + \\cos^2 t)dt = 1 \\, dt.\n$$\nThe line integral is then\n$$\n\\oint_C \\alpha = \\int_0^{2\\pi} 1 \\, dt = 2\\pi.\n$$\nSince $\\oint_C \\alpha = 2\\pi \\neq 0$, the form $\\alpha$ cannot be exact on the domain $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$. If it were, i.e., $\\alpha=dh$, the integral would have to be $h(\\gamma(2\\pi)) - h(\\gamma(0)) = h(1,0) - h(1,0) = 0$.\nTherefore, $\\alpha$ is a closed but not exact form on $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\n**Consistency with $d^2=0$ and Topology:**\nThe property $d^2=0$ implies that any exact form is necessarily closed. If $\\omega = d\\beta$, then $d\\omega = d(d\\beta) = d^2\\beta = 0$. Our result does not contradict this. We have a closed form that is not exact. This means the converse implication (\"closed $\\implies$ exact\") is not true in general.\n\nThe validity of the converse statement depends crucially on the topology of the domain. Poincaré's lemma states that on a contractible domain (e.g., a star-shaped domain like $\\mathbb{R}^2$ itself), every closed form is exact. The domain in this problem, $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$, is not contractible. It has a \"hole\" at the origin and is homotopy equivalent to a circle $S^1$. The existence of this topological hole is precisely what allows for the existence of closed forms that are not exact. The form $\\alpha$ \"detects\" this hole, as evidenced by its non-zero integral around it. This phenomenon is formalized by de Rham cohomology, where the space of closed forms modulo exact forms, $H^1_{dR}(\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\})$, is non-trivial. Our result shows that the cohomology class $[\\alpha]$ is a non-zero element of this space.\n\nIn summary, the calculation $d\\alpha=0$ shows $\\alpha$ is closed. The calculation $\\oint_C \\alpha \\neq 0$ shows $\\alpha$ is not exact. This is consistent with $d^2=0$ and highlights that the implication \"closed $\\implies$ exact\" holds only on domains with trivial topology (in the relevant dimension), which $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$ is not.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3078607"}, {"introduction": "The true elegance of the exterior derivative is revealed through its central role in the generalized Stokes' theorem, which states $\\int_{M} d\\omega = \\int_{\\partial M} \\omega$.
