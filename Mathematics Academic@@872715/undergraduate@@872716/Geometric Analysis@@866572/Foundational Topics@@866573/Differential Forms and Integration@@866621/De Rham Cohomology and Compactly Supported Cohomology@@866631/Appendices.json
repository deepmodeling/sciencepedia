It presents a standard exercise in the field of differential geometry, utilizing core definitions of differential forms, the exterior derivative, and the concept of closure within the de Rham cohomology framework. All provided definitions are standard and correct. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to construct a smooth, nonzero, closed $2$-form $\\omega$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and then explicitly compute its exterior derivative $d\\omega$ to verify closure.\n\nA general smooth $2$-form $\\omega$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with coordinates $(x, y, z)$ can be written as:\n$$\n\\omega = f(x,y,z) \\, dy \\wedge dz + g(x,y,z) \\, dz \\wedge dx + h(x,y,z) \\, dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nwhere $f$, $g$, and $h$ are smooth functions on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\n\nTo compute the exterior derivative $d\\omega$, we apply the operator $d$ to $\\omega$. Using the linearity of $d$ and the graded Leibniz rule $d(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = d\\alpha \\wedge \\beta + (-1)^{\\deg(\\alpha)} \\alpha \\wedge d\\beta$, we proceed term by term.\nFor the first term, $f \\, dy \\wedge dz$, $f$ is a $0$-form and $dy \\wedge dz$ is a $2$-form.\n$$\nd(f \\, dy \\wedge dz) = df \\wedge (dy \\wedge dz) + (-1)^{0} f \\wedge d(dy \\wedge dz) = df \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + f \\wedge d(dy \\wedge dz)\n$$\nThe exterior derivative of a function $f$ (a $0$-form) is its total differential:\n$$\ndf = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} dy + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} dz\n$$\nA fundamental property of the exterior derivative is that $d^2 = 0$. Since $dy = d(y)$ and $dz=d(z)$, we have $d(dy) = d(d(y)) = 0$ and $d(dz) = d(d(z)) = 0$. Applying the Leibniz rule again to $d(dy \\wedge dz)$:\n$$\nd(dy \\wedge dz) = d(dy) \\wedge dz - dy \\wedge d(dz) = 0 \\wedge dz - dy \\wedge 0 = 0\n$$\nThus, the expression for $d(f \\, dy \\wedge dz)$ simplifies to:\n$$\nd(f \\, dy \\wedge dz) = df \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} dy + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} dz\\right) \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\nUsing the property that the wedge product is alternating (e.g., $dy \\wedge dy = 0$ and $dz \\wedge dz = 0$), only the $dx$ term survives:\n$$\nd(f \\, dy \\wedge dz) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\nBy cyclic permutation of the coordinates $(x, y, z)$, we find the derivatives of the other two terms:\n$$\nd(g \\, dz \\wedge dx) = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\n$$\nd(h \\, dx \\wedge dy) = \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial z} dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy = \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial z} dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\nSumming these results gives the general expression for $d\\omega$:\n$$\nd\\omega = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial z}\\right) dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\nA form $\\omega$ is closed if $d\\omega = 0$. This requires the coefficient of the volume form $dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$ to be identically zero. That is, we need to find smooth functions $f, g, h$, not all zero, such that $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial z} = 0$. This condition is recognizable as the divergence of the vector field $\\vec{F} = (f, g, h)$ being zero.\n\nA systematic method to construct a closed form is to leverage the property $d^2=0$. Any exact form is necessarily closed. Therefore, we can construct our closed $2$-form $\\omega$ by taking the exterior derivative of a non-trivial $1$-form $\\alpha$. Let us define a smooth $1$-form $\\alpha$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$:\n$$\n\\alpha = z^{2} \\, dx + x^{2} \\, dy + y^{2} \\, dz\n$$\nThis is a smooth, nonzero $1$-form. Now we construct the $2$-form $\\omega$ by computing $\\omega = d\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\omega = d(z^{2} \\, dx + x^{2} \\, dy + y^{2} \\, dz) = d(z^{2}) \\wedge dx + d(x^{2}) \\wedge dy + d(y^{2}) \\wedge dz\n$$\nThe differentials of the coefficient functions are:\n$d(z^{2}) = 2z \\, dz$\n$d(x^{2}) = 2x \\, dx$\n$d(y^{2}) = 2y \\, dy$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\omega$:\n$$\n\\omega = (2z \\, dz) \\wedge dx + (2x \\, dx) \\wedge dy + (2y \\, dy) \\wedge dz\n$$\nUsing the antisymmetry of the wedge product (e.g., $dx \\wedge dy = -dy \\wedge dx$), we collect the terms corresponding to the basis $2$-forms $dy \\wedge dz$, $dz \\wedge dx$, and $dx \\wedge dy$:\n$$\n\\omega = 2y \\, dy \\wedge dz + 2z \\, dz \\wedge dx + 2x \\, dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nThis is our constructed smooth, nonzero $2$-form on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. By construction, it must be closed, since $\\omega = d\\alpha$, which implies $d\\omega = d(d\\alpha) = 0$.\n\nThe problem requires us to explicitly compute $d\\omega$ to verify its closure. We have $\\omega = f \\, dy \\wedge dz + g \\, dz \\wedge dx + h \\, dx \\wedge dy$, where the coefficient functions are:\n$f(x,y,z) = 2y$\n$g(x,y,z) = 2z$\n$h(x,y,z) = 2x$\nWe apply the previously derived formula for $d\\omega$:\n$$\nd\\omega = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial z}\\right) dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\nWe compute the partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(2y) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(2z) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(2x) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $d\\omega$:\n$$\nd\\omega = (0 + 0 + 0) \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = 0 \\cdot (dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz) = 0\n$$\nThe result of the explicit computation is the zero $3$-form, which verifies that the constructed $2$-form $\\omega = 2y \\, dy \\wedge dz + 2z \\, dz \\wedge dx + 2x \\, dx \\wedge dy$ is indeed closed.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in differential geometry concerning the Poincaré lemma on a contractible domain. All terms are clearly defined, and the premises are scientifically sound.\n\nLet $B^n \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ be the open unit ball, which is a star-shaped domain with respect to the origin. Let $\\omega$ be a smooth, closed $1$-form on $B^n$, meaning $d\\omega=0$. We want to show that $\\omega$ is exact, i.e., there exists a smooth function $f: B^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ (a $0$-form), called a potential function, such that $df = \\omega$.\n\nThe proof relies on the homotopy invariance of de Rham cohomology. The core idea is to construct an operator that inverts the exterior derivative $d$ for closed forms on a contractible space. The contractibility of $B^n$ is established by the existence of a smooth homotopy between the identity map and a constant map.\n\nLet us define the homotopy $H: [0,1] \\times B^n \\to B^n$ by $H(t,x) = tx$. This map smoothly deforms the open ball $B^n$ to the origin. For each $t \\in [0,1]$, we have a map $\\varphi_t: B^n \\to B^n$ given by $\\varphi_t(x) = H(t,x) = tx$.\nThe map $\\varphi_1 = \\text{id}_{B^n}$ is the identity map on $B^n$.\nThe map $\\varphi_0$ is the constant map $\\varphi_0(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in B^n$.\n\nThe homotopy $H$ induces a chain homotopy operator $K: \\Omega^k(B^n) \\to \\Omega^{k-1}(B^n)$ for each degree $k \\geq 1$. This operator satisfies the chain homotopy formula:\n$$\n\\varphi_1^* - \\varphi_0^* = dK + Kd\n$$\nHere, $\\varphi_t^*$ denotes the pullback map on differential forms induced by $\\varphi_t$. For any $k$-form $\\alpha$, the formula reads $\\varphi_1^*\\alpha - \\varphi_0^*\\alpha = d(K\\alpha) + K(d\\alpha)$. This formula is a direct expression of the homotopy invariance principle for pullbacks. While its proof for flows is a consequence of Cartan's formula, we use this more general version suitable for any homotopy.\n\nWe apply this formula to our closed $1$-form $\\omega$.\n1.  The pullback by the identity map is the identity operator on forms: $\\varphi_1^*\\omega = \\omega$.\n2.  The map $\\varphi_0$ sends all of $B^n$ to the origin $\\{0\\}$. The pullback of any $k$-form with $k > 0$ to a $0$-dimensional manifold is the zero form. Thus, $\\varphi_0^*\\omega = 0$.\n3.  The problem states that $\\omega$ is closed, which means $d\\omega = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these into the homotopy formula for $\\alpha=\\omega$:\n$$\n\\omega - 0 = d(K\\omega) + K(d\\omega) = d(K\\omega) + K(0) = d(K\\omega)\n$$\nThis shows that $\\omega = d(K\\omega)$. Thus, the $0$-form $f = K\\omega$ is a potential function for $\\omega$. Every closed $1$-form on $B^n$ is therefore exact.\n\nNext, we construct this potential function $f=K\\omega$ explicitly. The homotopy operator $K$ is defined by integrating the \"dt-part\" of the pullback of a form to the product manifold $[0,1] \\times B^n$. Specifically, for a $k$-form $\\alpha$, $(K\\alpha)_x = \\int_0^1 (i_{\\partial/\\partial t} H^*\\alpha)(t,x) dt$, where $i_{\\partial/\\partial t}$ is the interior product with respect to the vector field $\\partial/\\partial t$ on $[0,1] \\times B^n$.\n\nLet $\\omega$ be a $1$-form on $B^n$. In local coordinates $x=(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$, we can write $\\omega = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega_i(x) dx_i$. We compute the pullback $H^*\\omega$. The map is $H(t,x) = (tx_1, \\dots, tx_n)$.\n$$\nH^*\\omega = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega_i(H(t,x)) d(tx_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega_i(tx) (t\\,dx_i + x_i\\,dt)\n$$\nSeparating the terms with $dx_i$ and $dt$:\n$$\nH^*\\omega = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n t\\,\\omega_i(tx)\\,dx_i\\right) + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\,\\omega_i(tx)\\right)dt\n$$\nThe interior product $i_{\\partial/\\partial t}$ acts on $H^*\\omega$ by evaluation on $\\partial/\\partial t$. This isolates the coefficient of $dt$:\n$$\ni_{\\partial/\\partial t} (H^*\\omega) = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\omega_i(tx)\n$$\nThis is a smooth function on $[0,1] \\times B^n$ (a $0$-form).\nThe potential function $f(x)=K\\omega(x)$ is obtained by integrating this function with respect to $t$ from $0$ to $1$:\n$$\nf(x) = \\int_0^1 \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\omega_i(tx)\\right) dt\n$$\nThis provides an explicit formula for the potential function $f$, constructed by integrating $\\omega$ along radial paths from the origin to the point $x$. The existence of such paths for every $x \\in B^n$ is guaranteed because $B^n$ is star-shaped with respect to the origin. The condition $f(0)=0$ is naturally satisfied, as for $x=0$, the integrand is $0$.\n\nFinally, we apply this construction to the specific $1$-form on $B^2 \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$:\n$$\n\\omega(x_1, x_2) = (2x_1 + 3x_2^2)dx_1 + (6x_1x_2 + 4)dx_2\n$$\nHere, $n=2$, and the components of $\\omega$ are:\n$\\omega_1(x_1, x_2) = 2x_1 + 3x_2^2$\n$\\omega_2(x_1, x_2) = 6x_1x_2 + 4$\nFirst, we verify that $\\omega$ is closed:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\omega_1}{\\partial x_2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2}(2x_1 + 3x_2^2) = 6x_2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\omega_2}{\\partial x_1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1}(6x_1x_2 + 4) = 6x_2\n$$\nSince $\\frac{\\partial \\omega_1}{\\partial x_2} = \\frac{\\partial \\omega_2}{\\partial x_1}$, the form is indeed closed.\n\nWe now use our derived formula to find the potential function $f(x_1, x_2)$ satisfying $f(0,0)=0$.\n$$\nf(x_1, x_2) = \\int_0^1 \\left( x_1 \\omega_1(tx_1, tx_2) + x_2 \\omega_2(tx_1, tx_2) \\right) dt\n$$\nWe evaluate the components of $\\omega$ at $(tx_1, tx_2)$:\n$$\n\\omega_1(tx_1, tx_2) = 2(tx_1) + 3(tx_2)^2 = 2tx_1 + 3t^2x_2^2\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_2(tx_1, tx_2) = 6(tx_1)(tx_2) + 4 = 6t^2x_1x_2 + 4\n$$\nSubstitute these into the integral:\n$$\nf(x_1, x_2) = \\int_0^1 \\left( x_1(2tx_1 + 3t^2x_2^2) + x_2(6t^2x_1x_2 + 4) \\right) dt\n$$\nSimplify the integrand:\n$$\n\\text{Integrand} = (2tx_1^2 + 3t^2x_1x_2^2) + (6t^2x_1x_2^2 + 4x_2) = 2tx_1^2 + 9t^2x_1x_2^2 + 4x_2\n$$\nNow, perform the integration with respect to $t$ from $0$ to $1$:\n$$\nf(x_1, x_2) = \\int_0^1 (2tx_1^2 + 9t^2x_1x_2^2 + 4x_2) dt\n$$\n$$\nf(x_1, x_2) = \\left[ \\frac{2t^2}{2}x_1^2 + \\frac{9t^3}{3}x_1x_2^2 + 4x_2t \\right]_{t=0}^{t=1}\n$$\n$$\nf(x_1, x_2) = \\left[ t^2x_1^2 + 3t^3x_1x_2^2 + 4x_2t \\right]_{t=0}^{t=1}\n$$\nEvaluating at the limits:\n$$\nf(x_1, x_2) = (1^2x_1^2 + 3(1)^3x_1x_2^2 + 4x_2(1)) - (0) = x_1^2 + 3x_1x_2^2 + 4x_2\n$$\nThe resulting potential function is $f(x_1,x_2) = x_1^2 + 3x_1x_2^2 + 4x_2$.

Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth manifolds.\nA **smooth homotopy** between two smooth maps $f_0, f_1: M \\to N$ is a smooth map $F: M \\times [0,1] \\to N$ such that $F(x,0) = f_0(x)$ and $F(x,1) = f_1(x)$ for all $x \\in M$. If such a homotopy exists, $f_0$ and $f_1$ are said to be smoothly homotopic, denoted $f_0 \\simeq f_1$.\n\nLet $A$ be a submanifold of $M$. A **deformation retraction** of $M$ onto $A$ is a homotopy $H: M \\times [0,1] \\to M$ between the identity map $\\mathrm{id}_M$ and a retraction map $r: M \\to A$ (a map whose restriction to $A$ is the identity on $A$). This means $H(x,0) = x$ for all $x \\in M$, and $H(x,1) = r(x) \\in A$ for all $x \\in M$. A **strong deformation retraction** is a deformation retraction that additionally keeps points in $A$ fixed throughout the process, i.e., $H(a,t) = a$ for all $a \\in A$ and $t \\in [0,1]$.\n\nNow, we define a strong deformation retraction of $M = \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ onto the unit sphere $A = S^{n-1}$. For any point $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, its radial projection onto the sphere is $\\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|}$. We can smoothly interpolate between any point and its projection. Consider the map $H: (\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\times [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ defined by:\n$$ H(\\mathbf{x}, t) = (1-t)\\mathbf{x} + t \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|} $$\nThis map is smooth on its domain. We verify the properties of a strong deformation retraction:\n1. At $t=0$, $H(\\mathbf{x}, 0) = (1-0)\\mathbf{x} + 0 \\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|} = \\mathbf{x} = \\mathrm{id}_M(\\mathbf{x})$.\n2. At $t=1$, $H(\\mathbf{x}, 1) = (1-1)\\mathbf{x} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|} = \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|}$. This point lies on $S^{n-1}$ since its norm is $\\|\\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|}\\| = \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|} = 1$. The retraction map is $r(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|}$.\n3. For any point $\\mathbf{a} \\in S^{n-1}$, we have $\\|\\mathbf{a}\\|=1$. So, for any $t \\in [0,1]$, $H(\\mathbf{a}, t) = (1-t)\\mathbf{a} + t\\frac{\\mathbf{a}}{1} = (1-t+t)\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{a}$. This shows the retraction is strong.\n4. We must ensure that $H(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ never equals the origin for any $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ and $t \\in [0,1]$. The norm of $H(\\mathbf{x},t)$ is:\n$$ \\|H(\\mathbf{x},t)\\| = \\left\\| \\left( (1-t) + \\frac{t}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|} \\right) \\mathbf{x} \\right\\| = \\left| (1-t) + \\frac{t}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|} \\right| \\|\\mathbf{x}\\| $$\nSince $\\mathbf{x} \\ne 0$, $\\|\\mathbf{x}\\| > 0$. For $t \\in [0,1]$, $(1-t) \\ge 0$ and $t/\\|\\mathbf{x}\\| \\ge 0$. They are not simultaneously zero, so their sum is strictly positive. Thus, $\\|H(\\mathbf{x},t)\\| > 0$, and the map $H$ is well-defined with codomain $\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\nThis establishes that $\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ strongly deformation retracts onto $S^{n-1}$. Two spaces, one of which deformation retracts onto the other, are said to be **homotopy equivalent**.\n\nThe **homotopy invariance of de Rham cohomology** is a foundational result stating that if two smooth maps $f_0, f_1: M \\to N$ are smoothly homotopic, they induce the same homomorphism on the de Rham cohomology groups: $f_0^* = f_1^*: H^{k}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(N) \\to H^{k}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(M)$ for all $k \\geq 0$.\n\nLet $i: S^{n-1} \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ be the inclusion map and $r: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\} \\to S^{n-1}$ be the retraction $r(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}/\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|$. The deformation retraction implies that $i \\circ r \\simeq \\mathrm{id}_{\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}}$. Also, by definition of a retraction, $r \\circ i = \\mathrm{id}_{S^{n-1}}$. Applying the contravariant cohomology functor $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}$ to these relations gives:\n1. $(i \\circ r)^* = r^* \\circ i^*$. Since $i \\circ r \\simeq \\mathrm{id}_{\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}}$, homotopy invariance implies $(i \\circ r)^* = (\\mathrm{id}_{\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}})^* = \\mathrm{id}_{H_{\\mathrm{dR}}(\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\})}$.\n2. $(r \\circ i)^* = i^* \\circ r^*$. Since $r \\circ i = \\mathrm{id}_{S^{n-1}}$, $(r \\circ i)^* = (\\mathrm{id}_{S^{n-1}})^* = \\mathrm{id}_{H_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^{n-1})}$.\n\nThese two properties show that the induced map $i^*: H^{k}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\to H^{k}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^{n-1})$ is an isomorphism for all $k \\geq 0$, with inverse $(i^*)^{-1} = r^*$.\n\n### Part 2: Cohomology of the Sphere $S^{n-1}$\n\nWe compute $H^{k}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^m)$ for all $k \\ge 0$ by induction on the dimension $m \\geq 1$. The problem concerns $S^{n-1}$ with $n \\ge 2$, so we need the cohomology of spheres of dimension $m=n-1 \\ge 1$.\n\n**Base case ($m=1$):** We compute the cohomology of $S^1$. Let $N=(0,1)$ and $S=(0,-1)$ be the north and south poles of $S^1$. Let $U = S^1 \\setminus \\{N\\}$ and $V = S^1 \\setminus \\{S\\}$. Both $U$ and $V$ are open sets diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ and are thus contractible. Their cohomology is $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(U) = H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(V) = \\mathbb{R}$ for $k=0$ and $0$ for $k \\ge 1$. The intersection $U \\cap V = S^1 \\setminus \\{N, S\\}$ consists of two disjoint open intervals and is homotopy equivalent to $S^0$, the two-point space. Thus, $H^0_{\\mathrm{dR}}(U \\cap V) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$ and $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(U \\cap V) = 0$ for $k \\ge 1$.\nThe Mayer–Vietoris sequence contains the segment:\n$$ H^0(U) \\oplus H^0(V) \\xrightarrow{j^*} H^0(U \\cap V) \\xrightarrow{\\delta^*} H^1(S^1) \\to H^1(U) \\oplus H^1(V) $$\nThis becomes:\n$$ \\mathbb{R} \\oplus \\mathbb{R} \\xrightarrow{j^*} \\mathbb{R}^2 \\xrightarrow{\\delta^*} H^1(S^1) \\to 0 $$\nThe map $j^*$ takes a pair of constant functions $(c_1, c_2)$ to the difference of their restrictions on $U \\cap V$. This is the map $(c_1, c_2) \\mapsto (c_1-c_2, c_1-c_2)$, whose image is the one-dimensional subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ spanned by $(1,1)$. By exactness, $\\ker(\\delta^*) = \\mathrm{Im}(j^*)$, so quotienting $\\mathbb{R}^2$ by $\\mathrm{Im}(j^*)$ gives $H^1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2 / \\mathbb{R} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. For $k \\ge 2$, the sequence implies $H^k(S^1)=0$. $S^1$ is connected, so $H^0(S^1) = \\mathbb{R}$.\nResult for $S^1$: $\\dim H^0_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^1) = 1$, $\\dim H^1_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^1) = 1$, and $\\dim H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^1) = 0$ for $k \\ge 2$.\n\n**Inductive Hypothesis:** For an integer $m-1 \\geq 1$, assume $\\dim H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^{m-1}) = 1$ for $k=0$ and $k=m-1$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\n**Inductive Step:** We compute $H^k_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^m)$ for $m \\ge 2$. Let $N$ and $S$ be the poles of $S^m$. Let $U = S^m \\setminus \\{N\\}$ and $V = S^m \\setminus \\{S\\}$.\n- $U$ and $V$ are contractible, so $H^k(U) = H^k(V) = 0$ for $k \\ge 1$ and $\\mathbb{R}$ for $k=0$.\n- $U \\cap V = S^m \\setminus \\{N, S\\}$ is homotopy equivalent to the equator $S^{m-1}$. Since $m \\ge 2$, $m-1 \\ge 1$, so the inductive hypothesis applies to $S^{m-1}$. Thus $H^k(U \\cap V) \\cong H^k(S^{m-1})$.\n\nThe Mayer–Vietoris sequence is $\\dots \\to H^{k-1}(U \\cap V) \\xrightarrow{\\delta^*} H^k(S^m) \\to H^k(U) \\oplus H^k(V) \\to \\dots$.\n\n- For $k \\ge 2$: $H^k(U) = H^k(V)=0$ and $H^{k-1}(U)=H^{k-1}(V)=0$. The sequence yields an isomorphism $H^k(S^m) \\cong H^{k-1}(U \\cap V) \\cong H^{k-1}(S^{m-1})$.\n- For $k=1$: The sequence is $H^0(U) \\oplus H^0(V) \\xrightarrow{j^*} H^0(U \\cap V) \\xrightarrow{\\delta^*} H^1(S^m) \\to H^1(U) \\oplus H^1(V) = 0$.\nSince $m \\ge 2$, $S^{m-1}$ is connected, so $H^0(U \\cap V) \\cong H^0(S^{m-1}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. The map $j^*: \\mathbb{R} \\oplus \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ sends $(c_1, c_2) \\to c_1-c_2$, which is surjective. By exactness, $\\ker(\\delta^*) = \\mathrm{Im}(j^*) = \\mathbb{R}$. The sequence $0 \\to \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\to H^1(S^m) \\to 0$ implies $H^1(S^m) = \\{0\\}$.\n- For $k=0$: $S^m$ is connected for $m \\ge 1$, so $H^0(S^m) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nCombining these facts:\n- $\\dim H^0(S^m) = 1$.\n- $\\dim H^1(S^m) = 0$ (for $m \\ge 2$).\n- For $2 \\le k < m$, $\\dim H^k(S^m) = \\dim H^{k-1}(S^{m-1})$. Since $1 \\le k-1 < m-1$, by the inductive hypothesis, $\\dim H^{k-1}(S^{m-1}) = 0$.\n- For $k=m$, $\\dim H^m(S^m) = \\dim H^{m-1}(S^{m-1})$. By the inductive hypothesis, $\\dim H^{m-1}(S^{m-1}) = 1$.\n- For $k>m$, $\\dim H^k(S^m) = \\dim H^{k-1}(S^{m-1}) = \\dots = \\dim H^{k-m+1}(S^1)$. Since $k > m \\implies k-m+1 > 1$, from our base case, $\\dim H^{k-m+1}(S^1) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, for any sphere $S^m$ with $m \\ge 1$, the dimensions of the de Rham cohomology groups are:\n$$ \\dim H^{k}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^m) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } k=0 \\text{ or } k=m \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nThis holds for our specific case $m=n-1 \\ge 1$.\n\n### Part 3: Poincaré Polynomial of $\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}$\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial of a manifold $M$ is defined as $P_{M}(t) = \\sum_{k \\geq 0} b_k(M) t^k$, where $b_k(M) = \\dim H^{k}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(M)$ are the Betti numbers.\n\nFrom Part 1, we have an isomorphism $H^{k}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cong H^{k}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^{n-1})$. This means their Betti numbers are identical: $b_k(\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}) = b_k(S^{n-1})$.\n\nFrom Part 2, with $m = n-1$ (and $n \\ge 2 \\implies m \\ge 1$), the Betti numbers for $S^{n-1}$ are:\n- $b_0(S^{n-1}) = 1$\n- $b_{n-1}(S^{n-1}) = 1$\n- $b_k(S^{n-1}) = 0$ for all other $k$, i.e., $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-2\\}$ and $k \\ge n$.\n\nTherefore, the Betti numbers for $\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ are non-zero only for degrees $0$ and $n-1$. The Poincaré polynomial is:\n$$ P_{\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}}(t) = \\sum_{k \\geq 0} b_k(\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}) t^k = b_0(\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\})t^0 + b_{n-1}(\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\})t^{n-1} $$\n$$ P_{\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}}(t) = 1 \\cdot t^0 + 1 \\cdot t^{n-1} = 1 + t^{n-1} $$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ for $n \\ge 2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1 + t^{n-1}}$$", "id": "3045605"}]}
