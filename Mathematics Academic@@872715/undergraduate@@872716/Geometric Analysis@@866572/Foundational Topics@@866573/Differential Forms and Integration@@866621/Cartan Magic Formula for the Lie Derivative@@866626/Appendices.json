The exterior derivative of any exact form is zero, so $d(dx) = 0$ and $d(dy) = 0$. The wedge product is also alternating, which implies $dx^i \\wedge dx^i = 0$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\nd\\alpha = dx \\wedge dx + dy \\wedge dy = 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nSince $d\\alpha = 0$, the $1$-form $\\alpha$ is a closed form.
