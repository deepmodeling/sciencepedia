## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having established the foundational principles of immersions, [submersions](@entry_id:159709), and [regular values](@entry_id:161151) in the preceding chapter, we now turn our attention to the application of these concepts. The abstract machinery of [differential topology](@entry_id:157662) finds profound utility across diverse fields of mathematics and science. This chapter will demonstrate how the rank of a differential, the structure of level sets, and the powerful theorems of Sard and Preimage are employed to characterize geometric objects, classify topological structures, and prove the existence of maps with desirable "generic" properties. Our exploration will move from direct geometric constructions to more advanced applications in topology and analysis, illustrating the unifying power of these core ideas.

### Characterizing Manifolds as Level Sets

One of the most direct and powerful applications of the Regular Value Theorem (also known as the Preimage Theorem) is the ability to define [smooth manifolds](@entry_id:160799) implicitly as the solution sets to systems of equations. This bridges the gap between local, coordinate-based descriptions of manifolds and global, coordinate-free characterizations.

A simple yet illustrative example is the function $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x,y) = x^2+y^2$. The differential of $f$ is represented by the Jacobian matrix $Df(x,y) = \begin{pmatrix} 2x  2y \end{pmatrix}$. This differential is surjective—and thus the point $(x,y)$ is a regular point—unless $2x=0$ and $2y=0$, which occurs only at the origin $(0,0)$. The image of this sole critical point is $f(0,0)=0$. Therefore, $0$ is the only critical value of $f$, and every $c \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$ is a [regular value](@entry_id:188218).

By the Regular Value Theorem, for any [regular value](@entry_id:188218) $c > 0$, the level set $f^{-1}(c) = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x^2+y^2=c\}$ must be a smooth submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^2$ of dimension $\dim(\mathbb{R}^2) - \dim(\mathbb{R}) = 2-1=1$. This confirms our geometric intuition that these [level sets](@entry_id:151155), which are circles of radius $\sqrt{c}$, are indeed one-dimensional manifolds. In contrast, the [level set](@entry_id:637056) for the critical value $c=0$ is the single point $\{(0,0)\}$, which is not a 1-manifold, demonstrating how the theorem correctly predicts a change in geometric character at critical values [@problem_id:3052903].

This principle extends to higher dimensions and more complex systems. Consider the map $F: \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ defined by $F(x,y,z) = (x^2+y^2+z^2, x+y+z)$. A level set $F^{-1}(a,b)$ corresponds to the intersection of a sphere of radius $\sqrt{a}$ centered at the origin with a plane. By analyzing the rank of the Jacobian matrix of $F$, one can show that the [critical points](@entry_id:144653) are precisely the points on the line $x=y=z$. The images of these points constitute the set of critical values, which lie on the parabola $a = b^2/3$. For any value $(a,b)$ not on this parabola, such as when $a > b^2/3$, the value is regular. The Regular Value Theorem then guarantees that the corresponding [level set](@entry_id:637056)—the intersection of the sphere and the plane—is a smooth submanifold of dimension $\dim(\mathbb{R}^3) - \dim(\mathbb{R}^2) = 3-2=1$. Geometrically, we recognize this as a circle [@problem_id:3052894] [@problem_id:3052890].

Furthermore, for a function $F:\mathbb{R}^{m+1} \to \mathbb{R}$, the condition for $c$ to be a [regular value](@entry_id:188218) is that the gradient $\nabla F$ is non-zero at all points in the [level set](@entry_id:637056) $F^{-1}(c)$. The [gradient vector](@entry_id:141180) $\nabla F(x)$ is always normal to the level set at $x$. Therefore, if $c$ is a [regular value](@entry_id:188218), $\nabla F$ provides a smooth, nowhere-vanishing [normal vector field](@entry_id:268853) on the entire hypersurface $F^{-1}(c)$. The existence of such a field implies that the hypersurface is orientable, linking the analytic property of being a regular [level set](@entry_id:637056) to the global geometric property of [orientability](@entry_id:149777) [@problem_id:3052913] [@problem_id:3052882].

### Submersions and Fiber Bundles

A [submersion](@entry_id:161795) is a [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) $f: M \to N$ whose differential is surjective at every point of $M$. Consequently, if a submersion is surjective, every point in its codomain is a [regular value](@entry_id:188218). The Submersion Theorem, a powerful corollary of the Regular Value Theorem, states that every submersion is locally a projection; that is, the structure of the domain manifold is locally a product of the [codomain](@entry_id:139336) and a "fiber" manifold.

A straightforward example is the map $f: \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ given by $f(x,y,z) = (x+y, z)$. Its Jacobian matrix has rank 2 everywhere, making it a submersion. The [preimage](@entry_id:150899) of any point $(a,b) \in \mathbb{R}^2$, called the fiber over $(a,b)$, is the set of points satisfying $x+y=a$ and $z=b$. This is a straight line in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that can be parameterized by $\gamma(t) = (t, a-t, b)$. All fibers are parallel lines, and $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be viewed as the collection of these lines, parameterized by the points in $\mathbb{R}^2$. This illustrates the local product structure in a global and trivial fashion [@problem_id:3052905].

A much more profound example is the **Hopf fibration**, a celebrated map $H: S^3 \to S^2$. It can be shown that this map is a submersion; its differential has rank 2 at every point of the 3-sphere. By the Regular Value Theorem, the [preimage](@entry_id:150899) of any point on the 2-sphere is a smooth 1-dimensional submanifold of $S^3$. These fibers are in fact great circles of $S^3$. The Hopf [fibration](@entry_id:162085) thus presents the 3-sphere as a collection of disjoint circles "fibered" over the 2-sphere. This structure, known as a **[fiber bundle](@entry_id:153776)**, is a cornerstone of modern geometry and topology and finds critical applications in theoretical physics, particularly in the theory of [gauge fields](@entry_id:159627) and magnetic monopoles [@problem_id:3052920]. The map $f([x])=[Ax]$ for $A \in \mathrm{GL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$ is another example of a submersion between compact manifolds, in this case showing that such maps on the torus $T^2$ are diffeomorphisms [@problem_id:3052906].

### Immersions, Embeddings, and the Geometry of Curves and Surfaces

The distinction between an immersion and an embedding is fundamental to understanding how manifolds can sit inside a larger Euclidean space. An immersion requires only that the differential be injective at each point, a local condition. An embedding is an immersion that is also a homeomorphism onto its image, which is a global topological condition.

The standard inclusion of the circle $S^1$ into the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$, given by $i(x,y)=(x,y)$, is the archetypal example of an embedding. It is an immersion because the [tangent vector](@entry_id:264836) to the circle is never zero. It is also a homeomorphism onto its image because the map is injective and continuous, and a [continuous bijection](@entry_id:198258) from a [compact space](@entry_id:149800) ($S^1$) to a Hausdorff space ($\mathbb{R}^2$) is a [homeomorphism](@entry_id:146933) onto its image [@problem_id:3052942].

In contrast, consider the map $F: S^1 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ given in angular coordinates by $F(\theta) = (\sin(2\theta), \sin(\theta))$. One can verify that the derivative vector $F'(\theta)$ is never zero, so this map is an immersion. However, since $F(0) = (0,0)$ and $F(\pi) = (0,0)$, the map is not injective and thus cannot be an embedding. Its image is a "figure-eight" curve with a self-intersection at the origin. At this point, the image does not locally resemble a simple curve; it has two distinct tangent lines crossing each other [@problem_id:3052885].

This distinction has important consequences for defining geometric properties. The first fundamental form, or [pullback metric](@entry_id:161465), is a Riemannian metric defined on the *domain* manifold $M$. At a point $p \in M$, it is defined by $g_p(u,v) = \langle df_p(u), df_p(v) \rangle$. For this to be a metric, the form must be positive-definite, which is true if and only if $df_p$ is injective. Thus, an **immersion** is the necessary and [sufficient condition](@entry_id:276242) to endow the domain manifold with a metric induced from the [ambient space](@entry_id:184743). An embedding is not required. However, to define geometric quantities on the *image* $f(M)$, such as [extrinsic curvature](@entry_id:160405), which depend on a well-defined normal space, one typically needs an embedding. At a self-intersection point of an immersion, the [tangent space](@entry_id:141028) to the image is not uniquely defined, making the [normal space](@entry_id:154487) ambiguous [@problem_id:3052913].

### Connections to Topology: Degree and Winding Number

The concepts of [regular values](@entry_id:161151) and oriented [differentials](@entry_id:158422) are instrumental in computing topological invariants—quantities that remain unchanged under continuous deformations. One such invariant is the **[topological degree](@entry_id:264252)** of a map between two compact, oriented manifolds of the same dimension, such as $f: S^1 \to S^1$.

For any [regular value](@entry_id:188218) $y \in S^1$, the degree of $f$ can be computed by summing the "signs" of the differential at each point in the preimage $f^{-1}(y)$:
$$ \deg(f) = \sum_{x \in f^{-1}(y)} \operatorname{sgn}(\det(df_x)) $$
The term $\operatorname{sgn}(\det(df_x))$ is $+1$ if the differential preserves the local orientation and $-1$ if it reverses it. This formula provides a powerful way to compute a global invariant from local information at any [regular value](@entry_id:188218).

For example, consider the map $f: S^1 \to S^1$ given in angular coordinates by $f(e^{i\theta}) = \exp(i(3\theta+\varepsilon\sin\theta))$ for a small constant $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$. The derivative of the angular function is $3+\varepsilon\cos\theta$, which is always positive. This implies that the map is an immersion and, moreover, that every point in the [codomain](@entry_id:139336) is a [regular value](@entry_id:188218). Since the derivative is always positive, the map is orientation-preserving at every point, so $\operatorname{sgn}(\det(df_x))=+1$ for all $x$. The degree is simply the number of [preimage](@entry_id:150899) points for any [regular value](@entry_id:188218), say $y=1$. An analysis shows there are exactly three solutions to $3\theta+\varepsilon\sin\theta = 2k\pi$ in the interval $[0, 2\pi)$. Thus, the degree of the map is 3. This integer value captures the fact that the domain circle wraps around the target circle three times. This concept is directly related to the winding number of a closed curve in the plane around the origin, which can be defined as the degree of the associated normalized map from $S^1$ to $S^1$ [@problem_id:3052911].

### The Power of Genericity: Sard's Theorem and Transversality

Perhaps the most profound application of these ideas lies in the concept of "[genericity](@entry_id:161765)." In mathematics, a property is said to be generic if it holds for a "large" set of objects, in a topological or measure-theoretic sense. Sard's theorem is the foundational result that underpins this notion in [differential topology](@entry_id:157662). It states that the set of critical values of any [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) has Lebesgue measure zero. This means that [regular values](@entry_id:161151) are abundant; almost every value is a regular one.

**Morse theory** is a beautiful and extensive field built upon this idea. A Morse function is a smooth function $f: M \to \mathbb{R}$ whose [critical points](@entry_id:144653) are "non-degenerate." This non-degeneracy condition implies that the [critical points](@entry_id:144653) are isolated. For a Morse function on a compact manifold, the set of [critical points](@entry_id:144653) is finite, and thus the set of critical values is also finite. This is a very strong confirmation of Sard's theorem. For every value $c$ that is not one of these finitely many critical values, the level set $f^{-1}(c)$ is a smooth submanifold. Morse theory provides a detailed account of how the topology of these [level sets](@entry_id:151155) changes as one passes through a critical value, ultimately relating the [critical points](@entry_id:144653) of the function to the topology of the manifold itself [@problem_id:3052935].

The concept of a [regular value](@entry_id:188218) can be generalized to **[transversality](@entry_id:158669)**. A map $f: M \to N$ is transverse to a submanifold $S \subset N$ if, at every point of intersection, the tangent spaces of the image and the [submanifold](@entry_id:262388) span the ambient [tangent space](@entry_id:141028). This condition ensures that the preimage $f^{-1}(S)$ is a smooth submanifold of $M$. Transversality is the correct generalization needed to study intersections and preimages of submanifolds, not just points.

The most powerful result in this domain is the **Parametric Transversality Theorem**. It addresses the question: if we have a family of maps $f_p: M \to N$ indexed by a parameter $p \in P$, for which parameters is the map $f_p$ transverse to a fixed submanifold $S$? The theorem states that if an associated map $F(p,x) = f_p(x)$ is itself transverse to $S$, then the set of "bad" parameters $p$ for which $f_p$ fails to be transverse to $S$ has [measure zero](@entry_id:137864) in the parameter space $P$. The proof ingeniously shows that this set of bad parameters is precisely the set of critical values of a related projection map, to which Sard's theorem applies [@problem_id:3052909].

This principle has far-reaching consequences. It implies that [transversality](@entry_id:158669) is a [generic property](@entry_id:155721). One can almost always make a map transverse by an arbitrarily small perturbation. This is the key idea used to prove fundamental [existence theorems](@entry_id:261096), such as the Whitney Embedding Theorem, which states that any smooth $m$-manifold can be embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{2m}$. One starts with an arbitrary map and uses the machinery of [transversality](@entry_id:158669) to perturb it into an embedding, secure in the knowledge that "non-embedding" maps are a "small" set in the space of all possible maps [@problem_id:3044980]. This illustrates the ultimate power of Sard's theorem: it provides the foundation for showing that the smooth, well-behaved worlds described by the Regular Value and Transversality theorems are not the exception, but the rule.
