The solution will be derived from first principles using two distinct methods as specified, and the equivalence of the results will be established.\n\nFirst, we address the problem using the constraint method. The sphere $S^2$ is defined as the level set $F^{-1}(0)$ of the smooth function $F:\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ given by $F(x)=x\\cdot x-1$. For any point $p \\in S^2$, by definition, we have $\\|p\\|^2=1$, so $F(p)=\\|p\\|^2-1=1-1=0$. The tangent space $T_p S^2$ can be characterized as the kernel of the differential of $F$ at $p$, denoted $dF_{p}:T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\to T_{F(p)}\\mathbb{R}$. We identify the tangent space $T_p\\mathbb{R}^3$ with $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The definition of the differential states that it is the unique linear map such that for any vector $h \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, the following holds:\n$$F(p+h) = F(p) + dF_{p}(h) + o(\\|h\\|) \\quad \\text{as } \\|h\\| \\to 0$$\nWe compute the value of $F$ at the point $p+h$:\n$$F(p+h) = (p+h)\\cdot(p+h) - 1 = p\\cdot p + 2(p\\cdot h) + h\\cdot h - 1$$\nSince $F(p) = p\\cdot p - 1$, we have:\n$$F(p+h) = F(p) + 2(p\\cdot h) + \\|h\\|^2$$\nBy comparing this expansion with the definition of the differential, we can identify the linear term in $h$. The term $dF_p(h)$ is the part of the increment that is linear in $h$, which is $2(p\\cdot h)$. Thus, the differential is the linear map given by:\n$$dF_{p}(v) = 2(p\\cdot v)$$\nfor any $v \\in T_p\\mathbb{R}^3 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$. The remainder term is $\\|h\\|^2$, which is of order $o(\\|h\\|)$ since $\\lim_{\\|h\\|\\to 0} \\frac{\\|h\\|^2}{\\|h\\|} = 0$.\nThe gradient of $F$ at $p$ is $\\nabla F(p) = 2p$. Since $p\\in S^2$, $p$ is not the zero vector, so $\\nabla F(p) \\neq 0$. This ensures that $0$ is a regular value of $F$, and thus $S^2=F^{-1}(0)$ is a smooth submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The tangent space $T_{p}S^{2}$ is the kernel of the linear map $dF_p$. A vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ is in $T_p S^2$ if and only if $dF_p(v) = 0$.\n$$dF_{p}(v)=0 \\iff 2(p\\cdot v) = 0 \\iff p\\cdot v = 0$$\nTherefore, the constraint method yields the following characterization of the tangent space:\n$$T_{p}S^2 = \\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid p \\cdot v = 0\\}$$\nThis is the set of all vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ that are orthogonal to the position vector $p$.\n\nSecond, we use the curve method. A vector $v$ is in $T_p S^2$ if and only if there exists a smooth curve $\\gamma:(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)\\to S^2$ for some $\\epsilon0$ such that $\\gamma(0)=p$ and the velocity vector at $t=0$ is $\\gamma'(0)=v$.\nSince the curve $\\gamma$ lies on the sphere $S^2$, the equation $\\|\\gamma(t)\\|^2=1$ holds for all $t \\in (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$. This can be written as $\\gamma(t)\\cdot\\gamma(t) = 1$. Differentiating this identity with respect to $t$ using the product rule for the dot product, we get:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}(\\gamma(t)\\cdot\\gamma(t)) = \\gamma'(t)\\cdot\\gamma(t) + \\gamma(t)\\cdot\\gamma'(t) = 2(\\gamma(t)\\cdot\\gamma'(t))$$\nSince $\\gamma(t)\\cdot\\gamma(t)$ is constant ($1$), its derivative must be $0$.\n$$2(\\gamma(t)\\cdot\\gamma'(t)) = 0$$\nThis must be true for all $t$. In particular, at $t=0$:\n$$2(\\gamma(0)\\cdot\\gamma'(0)) = 0$$\nSubstituting $\\gamma(0)=p$ and $\\gamma'(0)=v$, we find the necessary condition:\n$$2(p\\cdot v) = 0 \\implies p\\cdot v = 0$$\nThis shows that any tangent vector defined via a curve must be orthogonal to $p$. So, $T_{p}S^{2} \\subseteq \\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\mid p \\cdot v = 0\\}$.\n\nTo show the converse (i.e., that any vector $v$ satisfying $p\\cdot v=0$ is a tangent vector), we must construct a suitable curve. Let $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ be a vector such that $p \\cdot v = 0$.\nIf $v$ is the zero vector, $v=0$, we can choose the constant curve $\\gamma(t)=p$ for all $t$. Then $\\gamma(0)=p$ and $\\gamma'(0)=0=v$, and the curve lies on $S^2$.\nIf $v \\neq 0$, we can construct a curve that corresponds to a great circle on $S^2$ passing through $p$ with initial direction $v$. Consider the curve:\n$$\\gamma(t) = p\\cos(\\|v\\|t) + \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\\sin(\\|v\\|t)$$\nThis curve is smooth for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We check the required properties.\n1. The curve lies on $S^2$:\n$\\|\\gamma(t)\\|^2 = \\left(p\\cos(\\|v\\|t) + \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\\sin(\\|v\\|t)\\right) \\cdot \\left(p\\cos(\\|v\\|t) + \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\\sin(\\|v\\|t)\\right)$\n$= \\|p\\|^2\\cos^2(\\|v\\|t) + \\left\\|\\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\\right\\|^2\\sin^2(\\|v\\|t) + 2\\left(p\\cdot\\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\\right)\\cos(\\|v\\|t)\\sin(\\|v\\|t)$\nSince $p\\in S^2$, $\\|p\\|=1$. By definition, $\\|v/\\|v\\|\\|=1$. From our assumption $p\\cdot v=0$, it follows that $p\\cdot(v/\\|v\\|)=0$. Substituting these values, we get:\n$\\|\\gamma(t)\\|^2 = (1)\\cos^2(\\|v\\|t) + (1)\\sin^2(\\|v\\|t) + 0 = 1$. The curve lies on $S^2$.\n2. The initial position is correct: $\\gamma(0) = p\\cos(0) + \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\\sin(0) = p(1) + \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}(0) = p$.\n3. The initial velocity is correct. First, we compute the derivative:\n$\\gamma'(t) = -p\\|v\\|\\sin(\\|v\\|t) + \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\\|v\\|\\cos(\\|v\\|t) = -p\\|v\\|\\sin(\\|v\\|t) + v\\cos(\\|v\\|t)$.\nEvaluating at $t=0$: $\\gamma'(0) = -p\\|v\\|\\sin(0) + v\\cos(0) = 0 + v(1) = v$.\nSince we have constructed a valid curve for any $v$ satisfying $p\\cdot v=0$, we have shown that $\\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\mid p \\cdot v = 0\\} \\subseteq T_{p}S^{2}$.\nCombined with the previous inclusion, this proves that the curve method also yields $T_{p}S^{2}=\\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid p \\cdot v = 0\\}$.\n\nFinally, for the third part, we verify that the characterizations agree and relate them to the pushforward of the inclusion map $\\iota:S^2 \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3$. Both methods have produced the identical set $\\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid p \\cdot v = 0\\}$. The tangent space $T_p S^2$ is thus identified with a specific $2$-dimensional linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\nThe pushforward map $\\iota_*: T_p S^2 \\to T_{\\iota(p)}\\mathbb{R}^3 = T_p \\mathbb{R}^3$ is defined by its action on a tangent vector $v=\\gamma'(0) \\in T_p S^2$. By definition, $\\iota_*(v) = (\\iota \\circ \\gamma)'(0)$.\nSince $\\iota$ is the inclusion map, $\\iota(x)=x$. Thus, $(\\iota \\circ \\gamma)(t) = \\gamma(t)$. The pushforward of the velocity vector $\\gamma'(0)$ is:\n$$\\iota_*(v) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} (\\iota\\circ\\gamma)(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\gamma(t) = \\gamma'(0) = v$$\nThe pushforward map $\\iota_*$ simply identifies the abstract tangent vector $v \\in T_pS^2$ with the same vector $v$ viewed as an element of the ambient space $T_p \\mathbb{R}^3 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$. The image of the pushforward, $\\text{Im}(\\iota_*)$, is therefore the set of all such vectors $v$, which our analysis has shown to be precisely the set $\\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid p \\cdot v = 0\\}$. This confirms that both foundational characterizations of $T_pS^2$ properly describe the tangent space as a specific subspace of the ambient Euclidean space, which corresponds to the image of the pushforward of the inclusion map.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\mid p \\cdot v = 0\\}}$$", "id": "3068285"}, {"introduction": "The differential, or pushforward, of a map is its best linear approximation at a point.

For maps between Euclidean spaces, the pushforward $H_{*|p}$ at a point $p$ is represented by the Jacobian matrix of $H$ evaluated at $p$. Let $p = (x,y,z)$.

A plane containing the $z$-axis has an equation of the form $av_1+bv_2=0$. If $v=(v_1,v_2,v_3)$ is in this plane, then $A(v) = (v_1,v_2,zv_1+v_3)$.

By its linearity, we can move the summation and the coefficients outside the action of $\\alpha_{F(x)}$:\n$$ (F^{*}\\alpha)_{k}(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial F^{i}}{\\partial x^{k}}(x) \\cdot \\alpha_{F(x)} \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{i}} \\bigg|_{F(x)} \\right) $$\n\nThe final step is to evaluate $\\alpha_{F(x)}$ on each basis vector $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{i}}\\big|_{F(x)}$. The problem states that the local expression for $\\alpha$ on $V \\subset N$ is $\\alpha = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\alpha_{j}(y) dy^{j}$. The basis $1$-forms $\\{dy^{j}\\}$ are dual to the basis tangent vectors $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{i}}\\}$, which means their pairing is given by the Kronecker delta: $dy^{j}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{i}}\\right) = \\delta^{j}_{i}$.\nAt the point $y=F(x)$, the action of $\\alpha_{F(x)}$ on the basis vector $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{i}}\\big|_{F(x)}$ is:\n$$ \\alpha_{F(x)} \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{i}} \\bigg|_{F(x)} \\right) = \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\alpha_{j}(F(x)) dy^{j} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{i}} \\bigg|_{F(x)} \\right) $$\nUsing linearity again:\n$$ = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\alpha_{j}(F(x)) \\cdot dy^{j} \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{i}} \\bigg|_{F(x)} \\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\alpha_{j}(F(x)) \\delta^{j}_{i} $$\nThe sum collapses, as $\\delta^{j}_{i}$ is non-zero only for $j=i$, yielding:\n$$ \\alpha_{F(x)} \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{i}} \\bigg|_{F(x)} \\right) = \\alpha_{i}(F(x)) $$\nThis shows that the $i$-th component of the $1$-form $\\alpha$ at a point is simply its value on the $i$-th basis vector.\n\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for $(F^{*}\\alpha)_{k}(x)$:\n$$ (F^{*}\\alpha)_{k}(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial F^{i}}{\\partial x^{k}}(x) \\alpha_{i}(F(x)) $$\nConventionally, the scalar functions are written first:\n$$ (F^{*}\\alpha)_{k}(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\alpha_{i}(F(x)) \\frac{\\partial F^{i}}{\\partial x^{k}}(x) $$\nThis expression represents the $k$-th component of the pullback $1$-form $F^{*}\\alpha$ in terms of the components of $\\alpha$ and the partial derivatives of the map $F$, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\alpha_{i}(F(x)) \\frac{\\partial F^{i}}{\\partial x^{k}}(x)}$$", "id": "3069035"}]}
