In the metric space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with the standard topology (which is induced by any of the metrics $d_1$, $d_2$, or $d_\\infty$), the set $Q$ is closed and bounded, and thus compact by the Heine-Borel theorem.

A continuous real-valued function on a compact set attains its maximum and minimum values.

This implies that for each component, the absolute difference is bounded: $|x_i - y_i| \\le 1$. This inequality will be central to our calculations.\n\n1.  **Diameter with respect to the metric $d_1$.**\nThe metric $d_1$ is defined as $d_1(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - y_i|$.\nUsing the bound $|x_i - y_i| \\le 1$ for each term in the sum, we can establish an upper bound for $d_1(x,y)$:\n$$ d_1(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - y_i| \\le \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 = n $$\nSo, for any two points $x,y \\in Q$, their distance $d_1(x,y)$ is at most $n$.

The distance between them is:\n$$ d_1(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{1}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |0 - 1| = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 = n $$\nSince we have found a pair of points in $Q$ for which the distance is $n$, and we have shown that no pair of points can have a distance greater than $n$, the maximum distance is $n$.\nTherefore, $\\operatorname{diam}_{d_1}(Q) = n$.\n\n2.  **Diameter with respect to the metric $d_2$.**\nThe metric $d_2$ is defined as $d_2(x,y) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - y_i|^2 \\right)^{1/2}$.\nUsing the bound $|x_i - y_i| \\le 1$, we have $|x_i - y_i|^2 \\le 1^2 = 1$.

We can again use the vertices $\\mathbf{0}$ and $\\mathbf{1}$:\n$$ d_\\infty(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{1}) = \\max_{1 \\leq i \\leq n} |0 - 1| = \\max\\{1, 1, \\dots, 1\\} = 1 $$\nAlternatively, we could choose $x = (0, 0, \\dots, 0)$ and $y = (1, 0, \\dots, 0)$.

Then\n$$ d_\\infty(x,y) = \\max\\{|0-1|, |0-0|, \\dots, |0-0|\\} = \\max\\{1, 0, \\dots, 0\\} = 1 $$\nThe upper bound of $1$ is attainable.\nTherefore, $\\operatorname{diam}_{d_\\infty}(Q) = 1$.\n\nIn summary, the diameters are:\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}_{d_1}(Q) = n $$\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}_{d_2}(Q) = \\sqrt{n} $$\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}_{d_\\infty}(Q) = 1 $$\n\nThe problem also asks to compare these values.

I will now proceed to derive the solution and evaluate each option.\n\n## Derivation and Option Analysis\n\n### Statement A: The metrics $d$ and $\\rho$ induce the same topology on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTwo metrics on a set $X$ induce the same topology if and only if for any point $x_0 \\in X$, every open ball in one metric contains an open ball centered at $x_0$ from the other metric.\n\nLet's consider an open ball in $(\\mathbb{R}, \\rho)$, denoted $B_\\rho(x_0, r) = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} : \\rho(x_0, x)  r \\}$ for some $r0$.\n$B_\\rho(x_0, r) = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} : \\sqrt{|x_0 - x|}  r \\} = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} : |x_0 - x|  r^2 \\}$.\nThis is precisely the open ball $B_d(x_0, r^2)$ in the metric $d$. Thus, every open ball in $(\\mathbb{R}, \\rho)$ is also an open ball in $(\\mathbb{R}, d)$.\n\nNow, let's consider an open ball in $(\\mathbb{R}, d)$, denoted $B_d(x_0, r) = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} : d(x_0, x)  r \\}$ for some $r0$.\n$B_d(x_0, r) = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} : |x_0 - x|  r \\} = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} : \\sqrt{|x_0 - x|}  \\sqrt{r} \\}$.\nThis is precisely the open ball $B_\\rho(x_0, \\sqrt{r})$ in the metric $\\rho$. Thus, every open ball in $(\\mathbb{R}, d)$ is also an open ball in $(\\mathbb{R}, \\rho)$.\n\nSince the collection of open balls for each metric is the same (up to a re-parameterization of the radius), the open sets generated by these bases are identical. Therefore, the metrics $d$ and $\\rho$ induce the same topology on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Verdict for A: Correct.**\n\n### Statement B: There exist constants $c0$ and $C0$ such that $c\\, d(x,y)\\le \\rho(x,y)\\le C\\, d(x,y)$ for all $x,y\\in\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThis statement asserts that the metrics $d$ and $\\rho$ are strongly equivalent (or bi-Lipschitz equivalent). Let's test the two inequalities separately by substituting the definitions.\n$c |x-y| \\le \\sqrt{|x-y|} \\le C |x-y|$.\n\n1.  Consider the inequality $\\sqrt{|x-y|} \\le C|x-y|$.\n    Let $u = |x-y|$. For the inequality to hold for all $x,y$, it must hold for all $u \\ge 0$.\n    For $u  0$, we can divide by $\\sqrt{u}$ to get $1 \\le C\\sqrt{u}$, or $\\sqrt{u} \\ge 1/C$.\n    However, we can choose $x$ and $y$ to be arbitrarily close, making $u$ arbitrarily close to $0$. As $u \\to 0^+$, the term $\\sqrt{u}$ also approaches $0$. For any constant $C0$, we can always find a $u$ small enough (e.g., $u  1/C^2$) such that $\\sqrt{u}  1/C$. Thus, this inequality cannot hold for all $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. No such constant $C$ exists.\n\n2.  Consider the inequality $c|x-y| \\le \\sqrt{|x-y|}$.\n    Let $u = |x-y|$. For $u0$, we can divide by $u$ to get $c \\le 1/\\sqrt{u}$, or $\\sqrt{u} \\le 1/c$.\n    However, we can choose $x$ and $y$ to be arbitrarily far apart, making $u$ arbitrarily large. As $u \\to \\infty$, the term $\\sqrt{u}$ also approaches $\\infty$. For any constant $c0$, the value $1/c$ is a fixed positive number. We can always find a $u$ large enough (e.g., $u  1/c^2$) such that $\\sqrt{u}  1/c$. Thus, this inequality cannot hold for all $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. No such constant $c$ exists.\n\nSince neither inequality holds for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the statement is false.\n\n**Verdict for B: Incorrect.**\n\n### Statement E: The identity map is uniformly continuous in both directions between $(\\mathbb{R},d)$ and $(\\mathbb{R},\\rho)$.\n\nThis is a precursor to statement C, so we address it first. Two metrics are uniformly equivalent if the identity map is uniformly continuous in both directions.\n\n1.  Uniform continuity of $\\mathrm{id}: (\\mathbb{R}, d) \\to (\\mathbb{R}, \\rho)$:\n    We need to show that for any $\\epsilon  0$, there exists a $\\delta  0$ such that for any $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, if $d(x,y)  \\delta$, then $\\rho(x,y)  \\epsilon$.\n    Given $\\epsilon  0$, we require $\\rho(x,y) = \\sqrt{|x-y|}  \\epsilon$. This is equivalent to $|x-y|  \\epsilon^2$.\n    Let's choose $\\delta = \\epsilon^2$. If $d(x,y) = |x-y|  \\delta$, then $|x-y|  \\epsilon^2$. Taking the square root of both sides gives $\\sqrt{|x-y|}  \\epsilon$, which is $\\rho(x,y)  \\epsilon$. Since $\\delta$ depends only on $\\epsilon$, the map is uniformly continuous.\n\n2.  Uniform continuity of $\\mathrm{id}: (\\mathbb{R}, \\rho) \\to (\\mathbb{R}, d)$:\n    We need to show that for any $\\epsilon  0$, there exists a $\\delta  0$ such that for any $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, if $\\rho(x,y)  \\delta$, then $d(x,y)  \\epsilon$.\n    Given $\\epsilon  0$, we require $d(x,y) = |x-y|  \\epsilon$.\n    The condition is $\\rho(x,y) = \\sqrt{|x-y|}  \\delta$, which is equivalent to $|x-y|  \\delta^2$.\n    To ensure $|x-y|  \\epsilon$, we can choose $\\delta$ such that $\\delta^2 = \\epsilon$, i.e., $\\delta = \\sqrt{\\epsilon}$.\n    If $\\rho(x,y)  \\delta$, then $|x-y|  \\delta^2 = (\\sqrt{\\epsilon})^2 = \\epsilon$. This is exactly $d(x,y)  \\epsilon$. Since $\\delta$ depends only on $\\epsilon$, the map is uniformly continuous.\n\nSince the identity map is uniformly continuous in both directions, the statement is true.\n\n**Verdict for E: Correct.**\n\n### Statement C: A sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ is $d$-Cauchy if and only if it is $\\rho$-Cauchy; consequently, $(\\mathbb{R},\\rho)$ is complete.\n\nThis statement has two parts.\n1.  Equivalence of Cauchy sequences:\n    A fundamental result in the theory of metric spaces is that if two metrics are uniformly equivalent (as we proved for statement E), then a sequence is Cauchy in one metric if and only if it is Cauchy in the other. Since $d$ and $\\rho$ are uniformly equivalent, the set of $d$-Cauchy sequences is identical to the set of $\\rho$-Cauchy sequences. This first part is true.\n\n2.  Completeness of $(\\mathbb{R}, \\rho)$:\n    A metric space is complete if every Cauchy sequence in it converges to a point within the space. We know that $(\\mathbb{R}, d)$ is a complete metric space.\n    Let $\\{x_n\\}$ be a Cauchy sequence in $(\\mathbb{R}, \\rho)$.\n    From part 1, $\\{x_n\\}$ must also be a Cauchy sequence in $(\\mathbb{R}, d)$.\n    Since $(\\mathbb{R}, d)$ is complete, the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ converges to a limit $L \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with respect to the metric $d$. This means $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} d(x_n, L) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} |x_n - L| = 0$.\n    We must now check if $\\{x_n\\}$ converges to $L$ in the metric $\\rho$. Convergence in $\\rho$ means $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\rho(x_n, L) = 0$.\n    $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\rho(x_n, L) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sqrt{|x_n - L|}$.\n    Since the square root function $f(t)=\\sqrt{t}$ is continuous at $t=0$, and $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} |x_n - L| = 0$, we can bring the limit inside the function:\n    $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sqrt{|x_n - L|} = \\sqrt{\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} |x_n - L|} = \\sqrt{0} = 0$.\n    So, the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ converges to $L$ in $(\\mathbb{R}, \\rho)$. Since an arbitrary $\\rho$-Cauchy sequence converges to a limit in $\\mathbb{R}$, the space $(\\mathbb{R}, \\rho)$ is complete. Both parts of the statement are true.\n\n**Verdict for C: Correct.**\n\n### Statement D: The identity map $\\mathrm{id}:(\\mathbb{R},d)\\to(\\mathbb{R},\\rho)$ is Lipschitz.\n\nA function $f: (X, d_X) \\to (Y, d_Y)$ is Lipschitz continuous if there exists a constant $K  0$ such that $d_Y(f(x_1), f(x_2)) \\le K \\cdot d_X(x_1, x_2)$ for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$.\nIn our case, this means we need a constant $K0$ such that for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n$\\rho(\\mathrm{id}(x), \\mathrm{id}(y)) \\le K \\cdot d(x,y)$\n$\\rho(x,y) \\le K \\cdot d(x,y)$\n$\\sqrt{|x-y|} \\le K|x-y|$.\nThis is the same inequality analyzed in Statement B. As shown there, if we let $u = |x-y|$, the inequality becomes $\\sqrt{u} \\le Ku$, which requires $\\sqrt{u} \\ge 1/K$ for $u0$. This fails for values of $u$ approaching $0$. The ratio $\\frac{\\rho(x,y)}{d(x,y)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{|x-y|}}{|x-y|} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|x-y|}}$ is unbounded as $|x-y| \\to 0$. Therefore, no such Lipschitz constant $K$ exists.

This is a well-posed problem.\n- **Objective (Critical)**: The language is formal, precise, and objective, using standard mathematical terminology. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the instructions (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, etc.). It is a standard and valid problem in mathematical analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to identify which of the given options presents a complete metric space $(X,d)$ and a self-map $f:X \\to X$ such that its Lipschitz constant is $L=1$ and it has no fixed points. A map with Lipschitz constant $L \\le 1$ is known as a non-expansive map. We are looking for a non-expansive map that is not a strict contraction and has no fixed points.\n\nThe Lipschitz constant $L$ of a map $f$ is the smallest non-negative number such that $d(f(x),f(y)) \\le L \\, d(x,y)$ for all $x,y \\in X$. This can be calculated as:\n$$L = \\sup_{x, y \\in X, x \\ne y} \\frac{d(f(x),f(y))}{d(x,y)}$$\n\nLet's analyze each option.\n\n**A. $X=\\mathbb{R}$ with $d(x,y)=|x-y|$, and $f(x)=x+1$.**\n1.  **Complete Metric Space**: The set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard metric $d(x,y)=|x-y|$ is a complete metric space.\n2.  **Self-Map**: The function $f(x)=x+1$ maps $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n3.  **Lipschitz Constant**: We compute the ratio of distances:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d(f(x), f(y))}{d(x,y)} = \\frac{|f(x)-f(y)|}{|x-y|} = \\frac{|(x+1) - (y+1)|}{|x-y|} = \\frac{|x-y|}{|x-y|} = 1\n    $$\n    for any distinct $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The supremum of these ratios is $1$. Thus, the Lipschitz constant is $L=1$. A map for which $d(f(x),f(y)) = d(x,y)$ for all $x,y$ is called an isometry.\n4.  **Fixed Points**: A fixed point $x$ must satisfy $f(x)=x$. This leads to the equation:\n    $$\n    x+1 = x\n    $$\n    Subtracting $x$ from both sides gives $1=0$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the function $f(x)=x+1$ has no fixed points in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThis option satisfies all conditions. It is a complete metric space with a map whose Lipschitz constant is $1$ and which has no fixed points.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. $X=\\mathbb{R}$ with $d(x,y)=|x-y|$, and $f(x)=\\cos(x)$.**\n1.  **Complete Metric Space**: As in option A, $(\\mathbb{R}, |\\cdot|)$ is a complete metric space.\n2.  **Self-Map**: $f(x)=\\cos(x)$ maps $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n3.  **Lipschitz Constant**: By the Mean Value Theorem, for any $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $x \\ne y$, there exists a $c$ between $x$ and $y$ such that\n    $$\n    \\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{x-y} = f'(c)\n    $$\n    Here, $f'(x)=-\\sin(x)$. Therefore, $|f(x)-f(y)| = |-\\sin(c)||x-y|$. The Lipschitz constant is $L=\\sup_{c \\in \\mathbb{R}} |-\\sin(c)| = \\sup_{c \\in \\mathbb{R}} |\\sin(c)| = 1$.\n4.  **Fixed Points**: A fixed point must satisfy $f(x)=x$, or $\\cos(x)=x$. Let's consider the function $g(x)=x-\\cos(x)$. We need to see if $g(x)=0$ has a solution.\n    - $g(0) = 0 - \\cos(0) = -1$.\n    - $g(\\pi/2) = \\pi/2 - \\cos(\\pi/2) = \\pi/2  0$.\n    Since $g(x)$ is continuous on the interval $[0, \\pi/2]$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a root $x_0 \\in (0, \\pi/2)$ such that $g(x_0)=0$. This $x_0$ is a fixed point of $f(x)=\\cos(x)$.\n\nThis option fails because the map has a fixed point.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. $X=[0,1]$ with $d(x,y)=|x-y|$, and $f(x)=1-x$.**\n1.  **Complete Metric Space**: The closed interval $[0,1]$ is a closed subset of the complete space $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, $([0,1], |\\cdot|)$ is also a complete metric space.\n2.  **Self-Map**: If $x \\in [0,1]$, then $0 \\le x \\le 1$, which implies $-1 \\le -x \\le 0$, and $0 \\le 1-x \\le 1$. So $f(x)=(1-x) \\in [0,1]$. Thus, $f$ is a self-map on $X$.\n3.  **Lipschitz Constant**: We compute the ratio of distances:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d(f(x), f(y))}{d(x,y)} = \\frac{|(1-x) - (1-y)|}{|x-y|} = \\frac{|y-x|}{|x-y|} = 1\n    $$\n    for any distinct $x,y \\in [0,1]$. The Lipschitz constant is $L=1$. This map is also an isometry of $[0,1]$.\n4.  **Fixed Points**: A fixed point must satisfy $f(x)=x$:\n    $$\n    1-x = x \\implies 1 = 2x \\implies x=1/2\n    $$\n    The point $x=1/2$ is in the domain $X=[0,1]$. Thus, there is a fixed point.\n\nThis option fails because the map has a fixed point.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. $X=S^{1}=\\{z\\in\\mathbb{C}:|z|=1\\}$ with $d(z,w)=|z-w|$, and $f(z)=\\overline{z}$.**\n1.  **Complete Metric Space**: The unit circle $S^1$ is a closed and bounded subset of the complex plane $\\mathbb{C}$. Since $\\mathbb{C}$ (with the standard metric) is a complete metric space, any closed subset is also complete. Thus, $(S^1, |\\cdot|)$ is a complete metric space.\n2.  **Self-Map**: For any $z \\in S^1$, we have $|z|=1$. The conjugate $\\overline{z}$ satisfies $|\\overline{z}|=|z|=1$, so $\\overline{z} \\in S^1$. The map $f(z)=\\overline{z}$ is a self-map on $S^1$.\n3.  **Lipschitz Constant**: We compute the ratio of distances for distinct $z,w \\in S^1$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d(f(z), f(w))}{d(z,w)} = \\frac{|\\overline{z} - \\overline{w}|}{|z-w|} = \\frac{|\\overline{z-w}|}{|z-w|} = \\frac{|z-w|}{|z-w|} = 1\n    $$\n    The Lipschitz constant is $L=1$. This map is an isometry of $S^1$.\n4.  **Fixed Points**: A fixed point must satisfy $f(z)=z$:\n    $$\n    \\overline{z} = z\n    $$\n    This condition is met if and only if the imaginary part of $z$ is zero, i.e., $z$ is a real number. The points on the unit circle $S^1$ that are also real numbers are $z=1$ and $z=-1$. Both are in $S^1$. Thus, there are two fixed points.\n\nThis option fails because the map has fixed points.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the analysis of all four options, only option A provides a correct example of a complete metric space and a map with Lipschitz constant $1$ that has no fixed point. This example successfully demonstrates that the condition $L1$ in the Banach contraction principle is sharp and cannot be relaxed to $L \\le 1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3056750"}]}
