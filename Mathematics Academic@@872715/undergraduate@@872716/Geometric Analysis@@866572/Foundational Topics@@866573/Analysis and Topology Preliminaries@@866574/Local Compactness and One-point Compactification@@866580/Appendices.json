Verification that $d^*$ is a metric**\nThe properties of non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles ($d^*(u,v)=0 \\iff u=v$), and symmetry ($d^*(u,v)=d^*(v,u)$) follow directly from the definitions and the properties of the metric $d$. The main challenge is the triangle inequality: $d^*(u,w) \\le d^*(u,v) + d^*(v,w)$. This can be established by a case-by-case analysis.
