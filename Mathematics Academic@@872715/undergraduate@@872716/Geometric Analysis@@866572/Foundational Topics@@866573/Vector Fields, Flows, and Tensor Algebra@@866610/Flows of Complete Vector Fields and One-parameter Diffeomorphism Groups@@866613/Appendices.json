We must verify that this function satisfies both the differential equation and the initial condition.\n\nFirst, we verify the initial condition at $t=0$:\n$$\n\\gamma(0) = \\exp(0 \\cdot A)x_{0} = \\exp(O)x_{0}\n$$\nwhere $O$ is the zero matrix. From the series definition, $\\exp(O) = I + O + \\frac{1}{2!}O^2 + \\dots = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.

Using the series definition of $\\exp(tA)$:\n$$\n\\gamma(t) = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(tA)^k}{k!} \\right) x_{0} = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{t^k A^k}{k!} \\right) x_{0}\n$$\nSince the series converges absolutely and uniformly on any compact interval of $t$, we can differentiate term-by-term:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\gamma(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{t^k A^k}{k!} \\right) x_{0} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{d}{dt} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{t^k A^k}{k!} \\right) x_{0}\n$$\n$$\n= \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{t^k A^k}{k!} \\right) x_{0} = \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{k t^{k-1} A^k}{k!} \\right) x_{0}\n$$\nThe $k=0$ term is a constant matrix $I$, so its derivative is the zero matrix.

Our solution $\\gamma(t) = \\exp(tA)x_0$ is defined for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ because the matrix exponential series always converges. Therefore, the solution is global, and the flow is complete. The unique flow is given by $\\Phi_{t}(x_{0}) = \\exp(tA)x_{0}$.\n\nNow we show that the family of maps $\\{\\Phi_{t}\\}_{t\\in\\mathbb{R}}$ forms a one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms.\n1.  **Group Property**: We must show $\\Phi_{t} \\circ \\Phi_{s} = \\Phi_{t+s}$ for all $s, t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    For any $x_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$:\n    $$\n    (\\Phi_{t} \\circ \\Phi_{s})(x_{0}) = \\Phi_{t}(\\Phi_{s}(x_{0})) = \\Phi_{t}(\\exp(sA)x_{0}) = \\exp(tA)(\\exp(sA)x_{0})\n    $$\n    A fundamental property of the matrix exponential is that if two matrices $M$ and $N$ commute (i.e., $MN=NM$), then $\\exp(M)\\exp(N) = \\exp(M+N)$. In our case, $M=tA$ and $N=sA$ commute, since $(tA)(sA) = tsA^2 = (sA)(tA)$. Thus,\n    $$\n    \\exp(tA)\\exp(sA) = \\exp(tA+sA) = \\exp((t+s)A)\n    $$\n    Therefore,\n    $$\n    (\\Phi_{t} \\circ \\Phi_{s})(x_{0}) = \\exp((t+s)A)x_{0} = \\Phi_{t+s}(x_{0})\n    $$\n    This holds for all $x_0$, so $\\Phi_{t} \\circ \\Phi_{s} = \\Phi_{t+s}$.\n\n2.  **Identity Element**: For $t=0$, we have $\\Phi_{0}(x_{0}) = \\exp(0 \\cdot A)x_{0} = I x_{0} = x_{0}$. Thus, $\\Phi_{0}$ is the identity map on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\n3.  **Inverse Element**: From the group property, $\\Phi_{t} \\circ \\Phi_{-t} = \\Phi_{t-t} = \\Phi_{0} = \\mathrm{id}_{\\mathbb{R}^n}$. This means $\\Phi_{t}^{-1} = \\Phi_{-t}$.\n\n4.  **Diffeomorphism Property**: For each $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the map $\\Phi_{t}(x) = \\exp(tA)x$ is a linear transformation on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. As a linear map, it is infinitely differentiable (smooth). Its inverse is $\\Phi_{-t}(x) = \\exp(-tA)x$, which is also a linear map and hence smooth. A smooth map with a smooth inverse is a diffeomorphism. Thus, each $\\Phi_{t}$ is a diffeomorphism of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ onto itself.\n\nFinally, we connect this flow to the one-parameter subgroup of $G = \\mathrm{GL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$ generated by $A$. Let $g(t) = \\exp(tA)$. The properties of the matrix exponential imply that $g(t)$ is a one-parameter subgroup of $G$:\n- $g(t)g(s) = \\exp(tA)\\exp(sA) = \\exp((t+s)A) = g(t+s)$\n- $g(0) = \\exp(0) = I$\n- $g(t)^{-1} = \\exp(-tA) = g(-t)$\nFor $g(t)$ to be in $\\mathrm{GL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$, it must be invertible. We know $\\det(\\exp(M)) = \\exp(\\mathrm{tr}(M))$. Thus, $\\det(g(t)) = \\det(\\exp(tA)) = \\exp(\\mathrm{tr}(tA)) = \\exp(t \\cdot \\mathrm{tr}(A))$. Since the exponential function never yields zero, $\\det(g(t)) \\neq 0$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, confirming that $g(t) \\in \\mathrm{GL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$.\nThe flow $\\Phi_{t}$ is precisely the action of this one-parameter subgroup on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$:\n$$\n\\Phi_{t}(x_{0}) = \\exp(tA)x_{0} = g(t) \\cdot x_{0}\n$$\nThis demonstrates the fundamental correspondence where an element of the Lie algebra $A \\in \\mathfrak{gl}(n,\\mathbb{R})$ generates a one-parameter subgroup $\\exp(tA) \\subset \\mathrm{GL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$, and this subgroup's action on the manifold $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the flow generated by the vector field $X(x)=Ax$.\n\nThe final expression for the flow acting on an initial point $x_0$ is therefore $\\Phi_{t}(x_0) = \\exp(tA)x_{0}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\exp(tA)x_{0}}\n$$", "id": "3048717"}, {"introduction": "While many vector fields generate well-behaved global flows, it is crucial to understand that this is not always the case, even for simple-looking fields on the real line.

Let $p=(x,y)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the composition $\\varphi_{Y}^{t}\\circ\\varphi_{X}^{t}$:\n$$\n(\\varphi_{Y}^{t}\\circ\\varphi_{X}^{t})(x,y) = \\varphi_{Y}^{t}(\\varphi_{X}^{t}(x,y)) = \\varphi_{Y}^{t}(x+t, y)\n$$\nApplying the definition of $\\varphi_{Y}^{t}$ with $x' = x+t$ and $y'=y$:\n$$\n\\varphi_{Y}^{t}(x+t, y) = (x+t, y + (x+t)t) = (x+t, y + xt + t^2)\n$$\nNext, we compute the composition $\\varphi_{X}^{t}\\circ\\varphi_{Y}^{t}$:\n$$\n(\\varphi_{X}^{t}\\circ\\varphi_{Y}^{t})(x,y) = \\varphi_{X}^{t}(\\varphi_{Y}^{t}(x,y)) = \\varphi_{X}^{t}(x, y+xt)\n$$\nApplying the definition of $\\varphi_{X}^{t}$ with $x' = x$ and $y'=y+xt$:\n$$\n\\varphi_{X}^{t}(x, y+xt) = (x+t, y+xt)\n$$\nFinally, we compute the difference vector:\n$$\n(\\varphi_{Y}^{t}\\circ\\varphi_{X}^{t})(x,y) - (\\varphi_{X}^{t}\\circ\\varphi_{Y}^{t})(x,y) = (x+t, y + xt + t^2) - (x+t, y+xt)\n$$\n$$\n= ((x+t) - (x+t), (y + xt + t^2) - (y+xt)) = (0, t^2)\n$$\nThe difference is exactly the vector $(0, t^2)$. This is an analytic expression in $t$. The problem asks for the leading-order term of this difference as $t\\to 0$. Since the expression is a monomial in $t$ (specifically, of order $t^2$), it is its own leading-order term. There are no terms of order $t^3$ or higher to discard.\n\nThe leading-order term of the non-commutativity error is the vector $(0, t^2)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ t^2 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3048741"}]}
