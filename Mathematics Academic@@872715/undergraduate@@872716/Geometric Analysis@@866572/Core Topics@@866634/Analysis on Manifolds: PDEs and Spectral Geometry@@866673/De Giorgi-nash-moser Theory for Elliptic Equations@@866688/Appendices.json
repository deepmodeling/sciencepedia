It poses a standard, non-trivial calculation in the theory of Sobolev spaces, which is a fundamental tool in the modern theory of partial differential equations, including the De Giorgi–Nash–Moser theory mentioned for context. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe goal is to compute two scaling ratios involving a function $u \\in W^{1,p}(B_R)$ and its rescaled version $u_R(x) = u(Rx)$ defined on $B_1$. The space $W^{1,p}(B_R)$ is the Sobolev space of functions on the ball $B_R \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ of radius $R0$ whose weak first derivatives are in $L^p(B_R)$. The dimension is $n \\geq 1$ and the integrability exponent is $p \\in [1, \\infty)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the ratio of the $L^p$ norms, $\\frac{\\|u_{R}\\|_{L^{p}(B_{1})}}{\\|u\\|_{L^{p}(B_{R})}}$.\nBy definition, the $L^p$ norm of $u_R$ on the unit ball $B_1$ is given by\n$$ \\|u_R\\|_{L^p(B_1)} = \\left( \\int_{B_1} |u_R(x)|^p \\, dx \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} $$\nSubstituting the definition of the rescaled function, $u_R(x) = u(Rx)$, we get\n$$ \\|u_R\\|_{L^p(B_1)} = \\left( \\int_{B_1} |u(Rx)|^p \\, dx \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} $$\nTo evaluate this integral, we perform a change of variables. Let $y = Rx$. This implies $x = y/R$. The transformation maps the ball $B_R$ to $B_1$. Correspondingly, the inverse transformation maps the integration domain $B_1$ to $B_R$. Specifically, if $x \\in B_1$, then $|x|  1$. For $y=Rx$, we have $|y| = |R||x| = R|x|  R$, since $R0$. Thus, $y$ lies in the ball $B_R$.\nThe differential volume element $dx$ transforms according to the determinant of the Jacobian of the map $x(y) = y/R$. The Jacobian matrix is $J = \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial y} = \\frac{1}{R} I_n$, where $I_n$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix. The determinant of the Jacobian is $\\det(J) = \\left(\\frac{1}{R}\\right)^n = R^{-n}$.\nTherefore, the volume element changes as $dx = |\\det(J)| \\, dy = R^{-n} \\, dy$.\nSubstituting the change of variables into the integral gives\n$$ \\|u_R\\|_{L^p(B_1)} = \\left( \\int_{B_R} |u(y)|^p (R^{-n} \\, dy) \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} $$\nThe constant factor $R^{-n}$ can be pulled out of the integral:\n$$ \\|u_R\\|_{L^p(B_1)} = \\left( R^{-n} \\int_{B_R} |u(y)|^p \\, dy \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} $$\nWe can take $R^{-n}$ outside the $p$-th root, which gives a factor of $(R^{-n})^{1/p} = R^{-n/p}$.\n$$ \\|u_R\\|_{L^p(B_1)} = R^{-\\frac{n}{p}} \\left( \\int_{B_R} |u(y)|^p \\, dy \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} $$\nThe remaining term is precisely the definition of the $L^p$ norm of $u$ on $B_R$. Thus, we have the relation\n$$ \\|u_R\\|_{L^p(B_1)} = R^{-\\frac{n}{p}} \\|u\\|_{L^p(B_R)} $$\nThe first required ratio is therefore\n$$ \\frac{\\|u_R\\|_{L^p(B_1)}}{\\|u\\|_{L^p(B_R)}} = R^{-\\frac{n}{p}} $$\n\nNext, we compute the ratio of the $L^p$ norms of the gradients, $\\frac{\\|\\nabla u_{R}\\|_{L^{p}(B_{1})}}{\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^{p}(B_{R})}}$.\nFirst, we must find the weak gradient of $u_R$. The problem instructs us to use the chain rule for weak derivatives. Let $g(x) = Rx$. Then $u_R(x) = u(g(x))$. The chain rule states that $\\nabla u_R(x) = (\\nabla u)(g(x)) \\cdot J_g(x)$, where $J_g(x)$ is the Jacobian matrix of $g$. As established before, $J_g(x) = R I_n$.\nSo, the gradient vector of $u_R$ is\n$$ \\nabla u_R(x) = (\\nabla u)(Rx) \\cdot (R I_n) = R (\\nabla u)(Rx) $$\nHere, $(\\nabla u)(Rx)$ is the gradient of $u$ evaluated at the point $Rx$.\nNow we can compute the $L^p$ norm of $\\nabla u_R$ on $B_1$:\n$$ \\|\\nabla u_R\\|_{L^p(B_1)} = \\left( \\int_{B_1} |\\nabla u_R(x)|^p \\, dx \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\nabla u_R(x)$:\n$$ \\|\\nabla u_R\\|_{L^p(B_1)} = \\left( \\int_{B_1} |R (\\nabla u)(Rx)|^p \\, dx \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} $$\nSince $R  0$, we have $|R (\\nabla u)(Rx)| = R |(\\nabla u)(Rx)|$. This gives\n$$ \\|\\nabla u_R\\|_{L^p(B_1)} = \\left( \\int_{B_1} R^p |(\\nabla u)(Rx)|^p \\, dx \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} $$\nWe can pull the constant factor $R^p$ out of the integral and then out of the $p$-th root:\n$$ \\|\\nabla u_R\\|_{L^p(B_1)} = (R^p)^{\\frac{1}{p}} \\left( \\int_{B_1} |(\\nabla u)(Rx)|^p \\, dx \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} = R \\left( \\int_{B_1} |(\\nabla u)(Rx)|^p \\, dx \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} $$\nWe apply the same change of variables as before: $y=Rx$, $dx = R^{-n} dy$, and the integration domain becomes $B_R$.\n$$ \\|\\nabla u_R\\|_{L^p(B_1)} = R \\left( \\int_{B_R} |(\\nabla u)(y)|^p (R^{-n} \\, dy) \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} $$\nPulling the factor $R^{-n}$ out of the integral and the $p$-th root, we get:\n$$ \\|\\nabla u_R\\|_{L^p(B_1)} = R \\cdot (R^{-n})^{\\frac{1}{p}} \\left( \\int_{B_R} |(\\nabla u)(y)|^p \\, dy \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} $$\nThis simplifies to\n$$ \\|\\nabla u_R\\|_{L^p(B_1)} = R \\cdot R^{-\\frac{n}{p}} \\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^p(B_R)} = R^{1-\\frac{n}{p}} \\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^p(B_R)} $$\nwhere $\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^p(B_R)}$ is the $L^p$ norm of the gradient of $u$ on $B_R$.\nThe second required ratio is therefore\n$$ \\frac{\\|\\nabla u_R\\|_{L^p(B_1)}}{\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^p(B_R)}} = R^{1-\\frac{n}{p}} $$\nThe pair of scaling ratios is $(R^{-\\frac{n}{p}}, R^{1-\\frac{n}{p}})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} R^{-\\frac{n}{p}}  R^{1-\\frac{n}{p}} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3045217"}, {"introduction": "The genius of the De Giorgi method lies in an iterative process that progressively refines information about a solution, turning a weak energy estimate into a strong regularity result.

All concepts—weak subsolutions, divergence-form operators, uniform ellipticity, truncations, Caccioppoli inequalities, and Sobolev embeddings—are fundamental and well-established in this field. The setup is a classic one for proving the Hölder continuity of weak solutions, a result due to De Giorgi.

It presents a standard, non-trivial problem from the theory of elliptic PDEs. I will now proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe problem asks to identify the correct statement and argument for De Giorgi's lemma, which establishes that local energy bounds for a subsolution imply a geometric decay of the measures of its superlevel sets. This is a crucial step in proving that the subsolution is locally bounded. The method is known as the De Giorgi iteration.\n\nLet's outline the core steps of the argument as requested.\n\n1.  **Cutoff Function Construction**: For the sequence of radii $r_j = r + 2^{-j}(R-r)$, we have a sequence of nested balls $B_r \\subset \\dots \\subset B_{r_{j+1}} \\subset B_{r_j} \\subset \\dots \\subset B_R$. For each $j$, we construct a smooth cutoff function $\\eta_j \\in C_c^\\infty(B_{r_j})$ such that $\\eta_j \\equiv 1$ on $B_{r_{j+1}}$ and $0 \\le \\eta_j \\le 1$. The gradient of such a function can be bounded by the reciprocal of the distance between the support boundaries, so $|\\nabla \\eta_j| \\le \\frac{C_{\\text{cutoff}}}{r_j - r_{j+1}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{cutoff}}}{(R-r)(2^{-j}-2^{-j-1})} = \\frac{C_{\\text{cutoff}}2^{j+1}}{R-r}$. We can absorb constants and write $|\\nabla \\eta_j| \\lesssim \\frac{2^j}{R-r}$.\n\n2.  **Energy Estimates**: We consider the function $v_j := w_j \\eta_j = (u-k_j)_+ \\eta_j$. Since $\\eta_j$ has compact support in $B_{r_j}$, $v_j \\in H_0^1(B_{r_j})$. We can apply the Sobolev embedding theorem to $v_j$:\n    $$ \\|v_j\\|_{L^{2^*}(B_{r_j})} \\le C_S \\|\\nabla v_j\\|_{L^2(B_{r_j})} $$\n    The gradient is $\\nabla v_j = \\eta_j \\nabla w_j + w_j \\nabla \\eta_j$. Using the triangle inequality and the Caccioppoli inequality provided for $w_j$:\n    $$ \\|\\nabla v_j\\|_{L^2(B_{r_j})}^2 \\le 2\\int_{B_{r_j}} |\\nabla w_j|^2 \\eta_j^2 \\mathrm{d}x + 2\\int_{B_{r_j}} w_j^2 |\\nabla \\eta_j|^2 \\mathrm{d}x $$\n    $$ \\le 2C \\int_{B_{r_j}} w_j^2 |\\nabla \\eta_j|^2 \\mathrm{d}x + 2\\int_{B_{r_j}} w_j^2 |\\nabla \\eta_j|^2 \\mathrm{d}x = C' \\int_{A_j} w_j^2 |\\nabla \\eta_j|^2 \\mathrm{d}x $$\n    Using the bound on $|\\nabla \\eta_j|$:\n    $$ \\|\\nabla v_j\\|_{L^2(B_{r_j})}^2 \\le C'' \\left(\\frac{2^j}{R-r}\\right)^2 \\int_{A_j} w_j^2 \\mathrm{d}x $$\n    Combining with the Sobolev inequality, we get an estimate for the $L^{2^*}$ norm of $v_j$.\n\n3.  **Connecting Levels**: We relate norms at level $j$ to the measure of the set at level $j+1$.\n    On the set $A_{j+1} = \\{x \\in B_{r_{j+1}} : u(x)  k_{j+1} \\}$, we have $w_j(x) = u(x) - k_j  k_{j+1} - k_j$. The difference in levels is $k_{j+1} - k_j = \\lambda_0(1-2^{-j-1}) - \\lambda_0(1-2^{-j}) = \\lambda_0 2^{-j-1}$. Let this be $h_j$. On $A_{j+1}$, $w_j  h_j$. Since $\\eta_j = 1$ on $B_{r_{j+1}} \\supset A_{j+1}$, we have $v_j(x) = w_j(x)  h_j$ for $x \\in A_{j+1}$. This gives a lower bound on the $L^{2^*}$ norm of $v_j$:\n    $$ \\|v_j\\|_{L^{2^*}(B_{r_j})}^{2^*} = \\int_{B_{r_j}} |v_j|^{2^*} \\mathrm{d}x \\ge \\int_{A_{j+1}} |v_j|^{2^*} \\mathrm{d}x  h_j^{2^*} |A_{j+1}| $$\n\n4.  **The Iterative Step**: The crucial step is to combine these estimates to form a recursive inequality for the measures $|A_j|$. This is typically done using a Chebyshev-type argument and Hölder's inequality. For instance, using Chebyshev's inequality:\n    $$ |A_{j+1}| = \\left|\\{x \\in B_{r_{j+1}} : w_j(x)  h_j\\}\\right| \\le \\frac{1}{h_j^2} \\int_{B_{r_{j+1}}} w_j^2 \\mathrm{d}x \\le \\frac{1}{(\\lambda_0 2^{-j-1})^2} \\int_{A_j} w_j^2 \\mathrm{d}x $$\n    The integral $\\int_{A_j} w_j^2 \\mathrm{d}x$ is then bounded using Hölder's inequality and the results from Sobolev's inequality. This is a highly technical step, but it ultimately yields a nonlinear recursion of the form:\n    $$ |A_{j+1}| \\le K \\cdot b^j \\cdot |A_j|^{1+\\alpha} $$\n    for some constants $K, b, \\alpha  0$. In this specific setting, the analysis shows $\\alpha = 2/n$. This leads to the inequality given in option A.\n\n5.  **Conclusion of the Iteration**: A recursion of the form $|A_{j+1}| \\leq M \\cdot (4^j/\\lambda_0^2) \\cdot |A_j|^{1+2/n}$ implies that if the initial value $|A_0|$ is small enough, or equivalently, if the parameter $\\lambda_0$ is chosen large enough, then $|A_j|$ converges to $0$ geometrically. The condition to start the convergence is roughly of the form $|A_0|^{2/n} \\cdot (M/\\lambda_0^2)  1$. For any fixed $|A_0|$, this can be achieved by choosing $\\lambda_0$ sufficiently large.\n    The convergence $|A_j| \\to 0$ implies that the measure of the set $\\bigcap_j A(k_j, r) = \\{x \\in B_r : u(x) \\ge k + \\lambda_0\\}$ is zero. Therefore, $u(x) \\le k + \\lambda_0$ almost everywhere in $B_r$, establishing a local upper bound for the subsolution.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options based on this standard argument.\n\n**Option A:** This option states the recursive inequality as\n$$ |A_{j+1}| \\leq C \\left(\\frac{2^{j}}{\\lambda_{0}}\\right)^{2} |A_{j}|^{1 + \\frac{2}{n}}. $$\nThis is the correct form of the recursive relation in De Giorgi's lemma. The coefficient $(2^j/\\lambda_0)^2$ arises from the lower bound $h_j = \\lambda_0 2^{-j-1}$ and other factors involving $2^j$ from the cutoff derivatives. The exponent $1+2/n$ is the classical result of this analysis, with $2/n$ coming from the interplay between the Sobolev embedding ($H^1 \\to L^{2^*}$) and dimensional analysis. The outline of the proof provided in this option—involving a cutoff $\\eta_j$, Caccioppoli's inequality, Sobolev's embedding, the lower bound on $w_j$, and Hölder/Chebyshev estimates—is a precise and correct summary of the standard proof. The conclusion that $|A_j| \\to 0$ if $\\lambda_0$ is large enough, which implies $u \\le k + \\lambda_0$ a.e. in $B_r$, is also correct.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B:** This option suggests that a maximum principle alone yields an exponential decay of the measure of superlevel sets. The weak maximum principle for divergence-form equations does not typically yield quantitative estimates on set measures like this. Such decay estimates are characteristic of the consequences of a Harnack inequality, which itself requires the full De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory (of which the lemma in question is a part). The claim that this can be achieved by the maximum principle *alone*, without truncations, cutoffs, or Sobolev embedding, is incorrect. These tools are essential precisely because the coefficients $a(x)$ are only measurable, which prevents the application of classical strong maximum principles.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C:** This option claims a *linear* recursion $|A_{j+1}| \\leq \\theta |A_j|$ with $\\theta \\in (0,1)$ independent of $\\lambda_0$. The De Giorgi iteration is fundamentally *nonlinear*, with the exponent $1 + 2/n  1$. A linear decay is only achieved after the iteration has run and the condition to start convergence is met. The factor $\\theta$ would then depend on having chosen $\\lambda_0$ large enough, so it's not independent of it. Furthermore, it incorrectly claims the derivation avoids Sobolev embedding and cutoffs, which are central to De Giorgi's method. The reference to a \"Nash-type inequality\" points to an alternative, but different, proof of Hölder continuity.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D:** This option invokes the Aleksandrov–Bakelman–Pucci (ABP) estimate. The ABP estimate is a powerful tool in the theory of elliptic equations, but it applies to *nondivergence-form* equations, i.e., equations of the form $F(D^2u, \\nabla u, u, x) = 0$. The problem is explicitly stated for a *divergence-form* equation, $-\\mathrm{div}(a(x)\\nabla u) \\leq 0$. The regularity theories for these two classes of equations are fundamentally different (at least in their classical development), with ABP being the cornerstone for the former and De Giorgi–Nash–Moser theory for the latter.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option A provides a correct statement of De Giorgi's lemma and a faithful outline of its proof.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3045243"}, {"introduction": "The powerful conclusions of the De Giorgi–Nash–Moser theory, such as the Harnack inequality, depend critically on the assumption of uniform ellipticity.

Which of the following statements correctly explain the failure of the Harnack inequality and provide a sound counterexample idea?\n\n- A. In $\\mathbb{R}^2$, let $A(x)=x_1^2 I_{2\\times 2}$ and consider $L u = -\\operatorname{div}(x_1^2 \\nabla u)$ in the unit ball $B_1$. For each fixed radius $r$ with $0r1$, the functions $u_m(x)=m x_2 + c$ with $m0$ and $c0$ are positive weak solutions on $B_r$, yet by choosing $m$ sufficiently close to $c/r$ from below, the ratio $\\sup_{B_r} u_m / \\inf_{B_r} u_m$ becomes arbitrarily large, demonstrating that no uniform Harnack constant can exist when the lower ellipticity bound vanishes on the set $\\{x_1=0\\}$.\n\n- B. Even without uniform ellipticity, as long as $A(x)$ is measurable and bounded above, the same Harnack inequality with a universal constant applies to all positive weak solutions in any ball inside $\\Omega$.\n\n- C. A counterexample can be obtained by taking $A(x)$ to vanish on a curve and defining a piecewise constant function $u$ that jumps across this curve; the vanishing of $A(x)$ eliminates all jump contributions in the weak formulation, so $u$ is a valid positive weak solution whose $\\sup/\\inf$ ratio can be chosen arbitrarily large.\n\n- D. In non-divergence form, even without a uniform lower bound on ellipticity, the Krylov–Safonov estimate still provides a Harnack inequality for bounded solutions with constants depending only on the upper bound of the coefficients.\n\n- E. If uniform ellipticity fails only on a closed degeneracy set, one can recover a local Harnack inequality on balls $B_r$ that stay a fixed positive distance away from this set (i.e., on regions where a positive lower ellipticity bound does hold), with constants depending on that lower bound and the distance to the degeneracy set.\n\nSelect all that apply.", "solution": "The central principle of the De Giorgi–Nash–Moser theory is that uniform ellipticity is a sufficient condition for the local Hölder continuity of weak solutions and for the Harnack inequality. The Harnack inequality states that for a positive weak solution $u$ and a ball $B_{2r} \\subset \\Omega$, there exists a constant $C$ such that $\\sup_{B_r} u \\le C \\inf_{B_r} u$. The constant $C$ depends only on the dimension $n$ and the ellipticity constants $\\lambda$ and $\\Lambda$. The problem investigates the consequences of the lower ellipticity bound failing, i.e., not having a uniform constant $\\lambda > 0$.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A.** This statement proposes a specific counterexample. Let's verify it. The matrix is $A(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1^2  0 \\\\ 0  x_1^2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $x_1^2$. The upper bound on $B_1$ is $\\Lambda=1$. The lower bound infimum is $0$, which occurs on the line $\\{x_1=0\\}$. Thus, the equation is degenerate, not uniformly elliptic. The proposed solutions are $u_m(x)=m x_2 + c$. Let's check if they satisfy the PDE:\n$$ \\nabla u_m = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ m \\end{pmatrix} \\implies A(x)\\nabla u_m = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ m x_1^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies L u_m = -\\operatorname{div}(A(x)\\nabla u_m) = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1}(0) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2}(m x_1^2)\\right) = 0 $$\nThe functions are indeed classical (and thus weak) solutions. For $u_m$ to be positive on a ball $B_r$ centered at the origin, we require $m x_2 + c > 0$ for all $x_2 \\in (-r, r)$. This is equivalent to the minimum value being positive: $m(-r) + c > 0$, which means $m  c/r$. Now consider the ratio of the supremum to the infimum on $B_r$:\n$$ \\frac{\\sup_{B_r} u_m}{\\inf_{B_r} u_m} = \\frac{m r + c}{c - m r} $$\nAs $m$ approaches $c/r$ from below ($m \\to (c/r)^-$), the denominator $c-mr \\to 0^+$, while the numerator approaches $2c$. Therefore, the ratio diverges to $+\\infty$. This shows that for any ball $B_r$ containing a piece of the degeneracy line $\\{x_1=0\\}$, there is no uniform Harnack constant that works for all positive solutions. This is a sound counterexample and a correct explanation of the failure. Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B.** This statement is fundamentally incorrect. The lower ellipticity bound $\\lambda0$ is a critical hypothesis in the proof of the De Giorgi–Nash–Moser theorem. The derivation of the Caccioppoli inequality, which powers the iterative methods, crucially uses the lower bound $\\lambda$. Without it, the proof breaks down. The counterexample in option A explicitly disproves this statement. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.** This statement proposes a counterexample based on a discontinuous function. A weak solution is typically required to be in the Sobolev space $H^1_{loc}(\\Omega)$ (locally square-integrable with a square-integrable weak gradient). A function with a jump discontinuity across a curve is not in $H^1_{loc}(\\Omega)$ because its weak derivative is a measure, not an $L^2_{loc}$ function. The entire machinery of DGNM theory is built upon the properties of $H^1$ functions. While it is true that in a distributional sense, the equation holds if $A$ vanishes where $\\nabla u$ is singular, calling such a function a \"valid weak solution\" in this context is misleading as it falls outside the standard class of solutions for which the theory is formulated. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.** This statement has two major flaws. First, it pertains to non-divergence form equations, whereas the problem is set in the context of divergence form equations. Second, the Krylov–Safonov Harnack inequality for non-divergence equations *also* requires uniform ellipticity, i.e., the existence of a lower bound $\\lambda > 0$. The constant in the Krylov–Safonov estimate depends on $n$, $\\lambda$, and $\\Lambda$. The claim that it holds without a lower bound is false. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E.** This statement accurately describes the local nature of the Harnack inequality. Let $S$ be the closed set where the ellipticity degenerates. For any compact subset $K \\subset \\Omega \\setminus S$, the matrix $A(x)$ is uniformly elliptic on $K$. Consequently, the standard De Giorgi–Nash–Moser theory applies, and a Harnack inequality holds for any ball $B_r$ such that $B_{2r} \\subset K$. The constant $C$ will depend on $n, \\Lambda$ and the local lower bound $\\lambda_K > 0$. The value of $\\lambda_K$ itself depends on the distance of $K$ from the degeneracy set $S$. As $K$ approaches $S$, $\\lambda_K \\to 0$, and the Harnack constant $C$ will typically blow up. This explains *why* a single, uniform Harnack constant does not exist for the entire domain: the constant deteriorates as one approaches the degeneracy set. This statement correctly explains the failure of the *uniform* inequality and provides the essential idea for where to look for counterexamples (i.e., near $S$).
