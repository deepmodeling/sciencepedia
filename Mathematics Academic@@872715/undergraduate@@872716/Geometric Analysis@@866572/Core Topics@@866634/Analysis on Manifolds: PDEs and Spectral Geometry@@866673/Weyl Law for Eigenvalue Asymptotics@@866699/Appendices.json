This serves as a concrete verification of the more general Weyl's law for eigenvalue asymptotics.\n\n- **Scientific Groundedness**: The problem is fundamentally sound.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution proceeds in several steps as outlined by the problem statement.\n\n**1. Solving the Eigenvalue Problem**\nThe eigenvalue problem is given by the second-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$ -u''(x) = \\lambda u(x) \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (0,L) $$\nwhich can be rewritten as\n$$ u''(x) + \\lambda u(x) = 0 $$\nwith Dirichlet boundary conditions $u(0)=0$ and $u(L)=0$. For a non-trivial solution to exist, we must have $\\lambda0$. Let $\\lambda = k^2$ for some $k0$. The general solution to the differential equation is\n$$ u(x) = A \\cos(k x) + B \\sin(k x) $$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants.\n\nWe apply the boundary conditions:\n- At $x=0$: $u(0) = A \\cos(0) + B \\sin(0) = A \\cdot 1 + B \\cdot 0 = A$. Since $u(0)=0$, we must have $A=0$.\nThe solution is thus of the form $u(x) = B \\sin(k x)$.\n\n- At $x=L$: $u(L) = B \\sin(k L)$. For a non-trivial solution, we require $B\\neq0$. Therefore, we must have:\n$$ \\sin(k L) = 0 $$\nThis condition is satisfied if $kL$ is an integer multiple of $\\pi$. That is,\n$$ kL = n\\pi \\quad \\text{for } n \\in \\mathbb{Z} $$\nSince we assumed $k0$, and $n=0$ would lead to the trivial solution $u(x)=0$, we must have $n$ be a positive integer, $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\nSolving for $k$, we get the wave numbers $k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$.\n\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are then given by $\\lambda = k^2$:\n$$ \\lambda_n = k_n^2 = \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\quad \\text{for } n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots $$\nEach eigenvalue $\\lambda_n$ is simple (has multiplicity $1$). The corresponding eigenfunctions are $u_n(x) = B_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$.\n\n**2. Deriving the Eigenvalue Counting Function $N(\\lambda)$**\nThe eigenvalue counting function $N(\\lambda)$ is defined as the number of eigenvalues $\\lambda_n$ such that $\\lambda_n \\le \\lambda$. We need to count the number of positive integers $n$ for which:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\le \\lambda $$\nTaking the square root of both sides (all quantities are positive):\n$$ \\frac{n\\pi}{L} \\le \\sqrt{\\lambda} $$\nSolving for $n$:\n$$ n \\le \\frac{L\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{\\pi} $$\nSince $n$ must be a positive integer, $N(\\lambda)$ is the number of integers in $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$ satisfying this inequality. This is precisely the largest integer less than or equal to $\\frac{L\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{\\pi}$. In terms of the floor function,\n$$ N(\\lambda) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{L\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{\\pi} \\right\\rfloor $$\n\n**3. Finding the Leading-Order Asymptotic of $N(\\lambda)$**\nWe need to find the behavior of $N(\\lambda)$ as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$. The floor function $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ satisfies the inequality $x-1  \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\le x$. Therefore,\n$$ \\frac{L\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{\\pi} - 1  N(\\lambda) \\le \\frac{L\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{\\pi} $$\nFor large $\\lambda$, the term $\\frac{L\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{\\pi}$ dominates the constant term $-1$. To find the leading-order asymptotic, we examine the ratio $\\frac{N(\\lambda)}{L\\sqrt{\\lambda}/\\pi}$ as $\\lambda\\to\\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{\\lambda\\to\\infty} \\frac{N(\\lambda)}{L\\sqrt{\\lambda}/\\pi} = \\lim_{\\lambda\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\lfloor L\\sqrt{\\lambda}/\\pi \\rfloor}{L\\sqrt{\\lambda}/\\pi} = 1 $$\nThis means that for large $\\lambda$, $N(\\lambda)$ is asymptotically equivalent to $\\frac{L\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{\\pi}$. We write this as:\n$$ N(\\lambda) \\sim \\frac{L}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\lambda} = \\frac{L}{\\pi} \\lambda^{1/2} $$\nThe coefficient of the leading-order term is $\\frac{L}{\\pi}$.\n\n**4. Computing the Geometric Constant**\nWeyl's law gives the leading-order asymptotic of $N(\\lambda)$ for the Dirichlet Laplacian on a domain $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ as:\n$$ N(\\lambda) \\sim \\frac{\\omega_d}{(2\\pi)^d} \\mathrm{vol}(\\Omega) \\lambda^{d/2} $$\nwhere $\\omega_d$ is the volume of the unit ball in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\\mathrm{vol}(\\Omega)$ is the volume of the domain $\\Omega$.\n\nIn this problem, the dimension is $d=1$. We need to compute the coefficient $C = (2\\pi)^{-1}\\,\\omega_{1}\\,\\mathrm{vol}(\\Omega)$.\n- The unit ball in $\\mathbb{R}^1$ is the set $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} : |x| \\le 1\\}$, which is the interval $[-1,1]$. Its $1$-dimensional Lebesgue measure (length) is $\\omega_1 = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n- The domain is $\\Omega=(0,L)$. Its $1$-dimensional Lebesgue measure (length) is $\\mathrm{vol}(\\Omega) = L-0=L$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the coefficient $C$:\n$$ C = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\cdot \\omega_1 \\cdot \\mathrm{vol}(\\Omega) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\cdot 2 \\cdot L = \\frac{L}{\\pi} $$\n\n**5. Comparison**\nThe coefficient of the leading-order term $\\lambda^{1/2}$ derived from the explicit calculation of eigenvalues is $\\frac{L}{\\pi}$. The geometric constant from the general formula of Weyl's law is also $\\frac{L}{\\pi}$. The two results are identical, which verifies Weyl's law for this elementary case.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nThe problem asks for the value of the geometric constant $(2\\pi)^{-1}\\,\\omega_{1}\\,\\mathrm{vol}(\\Omega)$.

The condition $u^{\\prime}(L)=0$ is also $A=0$. These conditions do not constrain $B$. Thus, $u(x)=B$ (a constant) is a non-trivial eigenfunction for any $B \\neq 0$. Therefore, $\\lambda_{0,N}=0$ is a Neumann eigenvalue.\n\n-   For $\\lambda  0$, applying $u^{\\prime}(0)=0$ gives $k(A\\sinh(0) + B\\cosh(0)) = kB = 0$, so $B=0$. The solution becomes $u(x) = A\\cosh(kx)$, with derivative $u^{\\prime}(x) = kA\\sinh(kx)$. Applying $u^{\\prime}(L)=0$ gives $kA\\sinh(kL)=0$. Since $k0$ and $L0$, $\\sinh(kL)0$, so we must have $A=0$. This gives only the trivial solution. There are no negative Neumann eigenvalues.\n\nThe set of Neumann eigenvalues includes the zero eigenvalue, so it is $\\{\\lambda_{n,N} = (\\frac{n\\pi}{L})^2 \\mid n=0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$. The eigenvalue counting function, $N_N(\\Lambda)$, is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\le \\Lambda \\implies n \\le \\frac{L\\sqrt{\\Lambda}}{\\pi}\n$$\nSince $n$ is a non-negative integer ($n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$), the number of such values is the number of integers in the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, \\lfloor \\frac{L\\sqrt{\\Lambda}}{\\pi} \\rfloor\\}$. This count is $\\lfloor \\frac{L\\sqrt{\\Lambda}}{\\pi} \\rfloor + 1$.\n$$\nN_N(\\Lambda) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{L\\sqrt{\\Lambda}}{\\pi} \\right\\rfloor + 1\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Limits**\n\nWe now compute the two required limits.\n\nFirst, the common leading Weyl limit $c$. Let $X(\\Lambda) = \\frac{L\\sqrt{\\Lambda}}{\\pi}$. We use the property of the floor function: $x-1  \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\le x$. Thus, for $X(\\Lambda)  0$:\n$$\n\\frac{X(\\Lambda)-1}{\\sqrt{\\Lambda}}  \\frac{N_D(\\Lambda)}{\\sqrt{\\Lambda}} = \\frac{\\lfloor X(\\Lambda) \\rfloor}{\\sqrt{\\Lambda}} \\le \\frac{X(\\Lambda)}{\\sqrt{\\Lambda}}\n$$\nSubstituting $X(\\Lambda)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\frac{L\\sqrt{\\Lambda}}{\\pi}-1}{\\sqrt{\\Lambda}}  \\frac{N_D(\\Lambda)}{\\sqrt{\\Lambda}} \\le \\frac{\\frac{L\\sqrt{\\Lambda}}{\\pi}}{\\sqrt{\\Lambda}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{L}{\\pi} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Lambda}}  \\frac{N_D(\\Lambda)}{\\sqrt{\\Lambda}} \\le \\frac{L}{\\pi}\n$$\nAs $\\Lambda \\to \\infty$, $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Lambda}} \\to 0$. By the Squeeze Theorem, $\\lim_{\\Lambda\\to\\infty} \\frac{N_D(\\Lambda)}{\\sqrt{\\Lambda}} = \\frac{L}{\\pi}$.\n\nFor the Neumann case:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\Lambda\\to\\infty} \\frac{N_N(\\Lambda)}{\\sqrt{\\Lambda}} = \\lim_{\\Lambda\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\lfloor \\frac{L\\sqrt{\\Lambda}}{\\pi} \\rfloor + 1}{\\sqrt{\\Lambda}} = \\lim_{\\Lambda\\to\\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\lfloor \\frac{L\\sqrt{\\Lambda}}{\\pi} \\rfloor}{\\sqrt{\\Lambda}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Lambda}} \\right) = \\frac{L}{\\pi} + 0 = \\frac{L}{\\pi}\n$$\nThus, the common limit is $c = \\frac{L}{\\pi}$.\n\nSecond, the constant shift $d$.\n$$\nd = \\lim_{\\Lambda\\to\\infty} \\left(N_N(\\Lambda) - N_D(\\Lambda)\\right)\n$$\nUsing the derived closed-form expressions:\n$$\nN_N(\\Lambda) - N_D(\\Lambda) = \\left(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{L\\sqrt{\\Lambda}}{\\pi} \\right\\rfloor + 1\\right) - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{L\\sqrt{\\Lambda}}{\\pi} \\right\\rfloor = 1\n$$\nThe difference is constant and equal to $1$ for all $\\Lambda \\ge 0$. Therefore, the limit is also $1$.\n$$\nd = \\lim_{\\Lambda\\to\\infty} 1 = 1\n$$\n\nThe final result is the row matrix $(c \\ d)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{L}{\\pi}  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3078770"}]}
