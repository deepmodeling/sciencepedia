Report only the minimum value of the speed as your final answer. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard exercise in the differential geometry of space curves.\n\nThe space curve is given by the vector-valued function $\\mathbf{r}(t) = \\big(t^{3},t^{2},t\\big)$ for $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the velocity vector, $\\mathbf{r}'(t)$, by differentiating the position vector $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ with respect to the parameter $t$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\big(t^{3},t^{2},t\\big) = \\big(3t^{2}, 2t, 1\\big)\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the speed, which is the Euclidean norm (magnitude) of the velocity vector, $\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\|$. The square of the speed is given by:\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\|^{2} = (3t^{2})^{2} + (2t)^{2} + (1)^{2} = 9t^{4} + 4t^{2} + 1\n$$\nThus, the speed is:\n$$\ns(t) = \\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\| = \\sqrt{9t^{4} + 4t^{2} + 1}\n$$\n\nTo find the minimum value of the speed $s(t)$, we can find the minimum value of the function inside the square root, let's call it $f(t) = 9t^{4} + 4t^{2} + 1$. Since the square root function is monotonically increasing for non-negative arguments, the minimum of $s(t)$ will occur at the same value of $t$ that minimizes $f(t)$.\n\nWe find the critical points of $f(t)$ by computing its derivative and setting it to zero:\n$$\nf'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(9t^{4} + 4t^{2} + 1) = 36t^{3} + 8t\n$$\nSetting $f'(t) = 0$ to find the critical points:\n$$\n36t^{3} + 8t = 0\n$$\n$$\n4t(9t^{2} + 2) = 0\n$$\nThis equation has two possible factors that could be zero: $4t = 0$ or $9t^{2} + 2 = 0$.\nThe first factor gives the solution $t = 0$.\nThe second factor, $9t^{2} + 2 = 0$, implies $t^{2} = -\\frac{2}{9}$. This equation has no real solutions for $t$.\nTherefore, the only real critical point of $f(t)$ is at $t=0$.\n\nTo determine if this critical point corresponds to a minimum, we use the second derivative test. The second derivative of $f(t)$ is:\n$$\nf''(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(36t^{3} + 8t) = 108t^{2} + 8\n$$\nEvaluating the second derivative at the critical point $t=0$:\n$$\nf''(0) = 108(0)^{2} + 8 = 8\n$$\nSince $f''(0) = 8 > 0$, the function $f(t)$ has a local minimum at $t=0$. Because $t=0$ is the only critical point on $\\mathbb{R}$ and the function $f(t)$ is a polynomial of degree $4$ with a positive leading coefficient ($9$), which tends to $+\\infty$ as $t \\to \\pm\\infty$, this local minimum is a global minimum.\n\nNow we calculate the minimum value of $f(t)$ by substituting $t=0$ into the function:\n$$\nf_{min} = f(0) = 9(0)^{4} + 4(0)^{2} + 1 = 1\n$$\nThe minimum value of the speed $s(t)$ is the square root of the minimum value of $f(t)$:\n$$\ns_{min} = \\sqrt{f_{min}} = \\sqrt{1} = 1\n$$\nThe minimum speed of the particle moving along the curve is $1$.\n\nThe problem then asks to use this result to justify the maximal open interval of regularity. A curve $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ is defined as regular on an interval if its velocity vector $\\mathbf{r}'(t)$ is non-zero for all $t$ in that interval. This is equivalent to the condition that its speed, $\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\|$, is non-zero.\nFrom our calculation, the speed is given by $s(t) = \\sqrt{9t^{4} + 4t^{2} + 1}$. The term inside the square root, $9t^{4} + 4t^{2} + 1$, has a minimum value of $1$ at $t=0$. For any other real value of $t$, $t^2 > 0$ and $t^4 > 0$, so $9t^{4} + 4t^{2} + 1 > 1$.\nConsequently, the speed $\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\|$ is always greater than or equal to $1$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since the speed is never zero, the velocity vector $\\mathbf{r}'(t)$ is never the zero vector. Therefore, the curve is regular for all $t \\in \\mathbb R$. The maximal open interval on which the curve is regular is $(-\\infty, \\infty)$.\n\nFinally, we explain why regularity is a prerequisite for setting up the Frenet-Serret frame. The Frenet-Serret frame is built upon the unit tangent vector $\\mathbf{T}(t)$. The definition of the unit tangent vector is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{T}(t) = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}'(t)}{\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\|}\n$$\nThis definition explicitly involves division by the speed, $\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\|$. This operation is only well-defined if $\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\| \\neq 0$. The condition $\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\| \\neq 0$ is precisely the definition of a regular curve. If a curve is not regular at a point $t_0$, i.e., $\\mathbf{r}'(t_0) = \\mathbf{0}$, the unit tangent vector $\\mathbf{T}(t_0)$ is undefined, and the foundation of the Frenet-Serret frame collapses. Such points are known as singular points (e.g., cusps or corners), where the notion of a unique tangent direction is lost. The further requirement that the curvature $\\kappa(t) = \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{T}'(t)\\|}{\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\|}$ be non-zero is necessary to define the principal normal vector $\\mathbf{N}(t) = \\frac{\\mathbf{T}'(t)}{\\|\\mathbf{T}'(t)\\|}$, and thus the full frame.

Let $\\mathbf{r}'(t) = \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt}$. We define the speed as $v(t) = \\frac{ds}{dt} = ||\\mathbf{r}'(t)||$. The chain rule for derivatives is then $\\frac{d}{dt} = \\frac{ds}{dt} \\frac{d}{ds} = v(t) \\frac{d}{ds}$, which implies $\\frac{d}{ds} = \\frac{1}{v(t)} \\frac{d}{dt}$.\n\nThe unit tangent vector $\\mathbf{T}$ is defined as $\\mathbf{T} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}$.

We relate $\\mathbf{T}'(t)$ back to the arclength derivative using the chain rule: $\\mathbf{T}'(t) = \\frac{d\\mathbf{T}}{dt} = v(t) \\frac{d\\mathbf{T}}{ds}$.

Such a curve is called a planar curve.\n\nFor a planar curve, the osculating plane at any point on the curve is the plane in which the curve entirely lies. Since the curve never leaves this plane, the osculating plane is constant. The binormal vector $\\mathbf{B}$ is, by definition, the normal to the osculating plane. Therefore, for a planar curve, $\\mathbf{B}$ must be a constant vector.\n\nLet's verify this. For $t\\neq 0$, the vectors $\\mathbf{T}(t)$ and $d\\mathbf{T}/dt$ both have a $z$-component of $0$, so they lie in the $xy$-plane. The principal normal vector $\\mathbf{N} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{T}/dt}{\\lVert d\\mathbf{T}/dt \\rVert}$ must also lie in the $xy$-plane. The binormal vector is $\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{T} \\times \\mathbf{N}$. Since $\\mathbf{T}$ and $\\mathbf{N}$ are orthogonal vectors in the $xy$-plane, their cross product $\\mathbf{B}$ must be a constant unit vector pointing along the $z$-axis. Specifically, $\\mathbf{B}$ will be either $\\mathbf{k} = \\langle 0, 0, 1 \\rangle$ or $-\\mathbf{k} = \\langle 0, 0, -1 \\rangle$. Let's compute it:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}(t) = \\mathbf{T}(t) \\times \\mathbf{N}(t) = \\frac{\\langle 3, 4t, 0 \\rangle}{\\sqrt{9+16t^2}} \\times \\frac{\\langle -4t, 3, 0 \\rangle}{\\sqrt{16t^2+9}}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}(t) = \\frac{1}{9+16t^2} \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\ 3 & 4t & 0 \\\\ -4t & 3 & 0 \\end{vmatrix} = \\frac{1}{9+16t^2} \\mathbf{k} (3 \\cdot 3 - (4t)(-4t)) = \\frac{9+16t^2}{9+16t^2}\\mathbf{k} = \\langle 0, 0, 1 \\rangle\n$$\nSo $\\mathbf{B}(t) = \\mathbf{k}$ for all $t \\neq 0$.\n\nTorsion is defined by the Frenet-Serret formula $\\frac{d\\mathbf{B}}{ds} = -\\tau \\mathbf{N}$.\nWe first find $\\frac{d\\mathbf{B}}{dt}$. Since $\\mathbf{B}$ is a constant vector, its derivative is the zero vector:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{B}}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\langle 0, 0, 1 \\rangle = \\langle 0, 0, 0 \\rangle = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, $\\frac{d\\mathbf{B}}{ds} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{B}/dt}{ds/dt} = \\frac{\\mathbf{0}}{\\lVert \\mathbf{r}'(t) \\rVert} = \\mathbf{0}$ for $t \\neq 0$.\nSubstituting this into the Frenet-Serret formula gives:\n$$\n\\mathbf{0} = -\\tau(t) \\mathbf{N}(t)\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{N}(t)$ is a unit vector, it is non-zero. Thus, we must conclude that $\\tau(t) = 0$ for all $t \\neq 0$.\n\n**(d) Computation of the Limit**\n\nWe are asked to compute the limit $L = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\, \\big|t\\big|^{2}\\, \\kappa(t)$.\nUsing the expression for $\\kappa(t)$ from part (b) and noting that $|t|^2 = t^2$, we have:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\, t^2 \\left( \\frac{12}{t^2(9 + 16t^2)^{3/2}} \\right)\n$$\nFor $t \\neq 0$, the $t^2$ terms in the numerator and denominator cancel:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\, \\frac{12}{(9 + 16t^2)^{3/2}}\n$$\nThe resulting expression is continuous at $t=0$, so we can evaluate the limit by direct substitution:\n$$\nL = \\frac{12}{(9 + 16(0)^2)^{3/2}} = \\frac{12}{9^{3/2}}\n$$\nWe evaluate the denominator: $9^{3/2} = (9^{1/2})^3 = 3^3 = 27$.\n$$\nL = \\frac{12}{27}\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, $3$, gives the final result:\n$$\nL = \\frac{4}{9}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}\n$$", "id": "3044645"}]}
