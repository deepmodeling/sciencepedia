In local proofs of functional inequalities such as the Nash inequality, one often works with functions $u \\in H^1_0(B)$ supported in $B$ and performs integration by parts on $B$ to estimate terms involving $\\nabla u$ and $u$.

A key result in Sobolev theory, the trace theorem, establishes that for any function in $H^1(B)$, there is a corresponding well-defined \"value\" on the boundary $\\partial B$, called its trace, which lies in the space $H^{1/2}(\\partial B)$. A cornerstone theorem states that a function $u \\in H^1(B)$ belongs to $H^1_0(B)$ if and only if its trace on $\\partial B$ is zero. The problem statement correctly lists both the definition of $H^1_0(B)$ in terms of $C_c^\\infty(B)$ and the zero-trace property as standard facts. We can therefore use either of these facts to construct a justification.\n\nLet's analyze each option based on these principles.\n\n- **A. Because $u\\in H^1_0(B)$ has zero trace on $\\partial B$, any boundary integral of the form $\\int_{\\partial B} u\\,\\partial_\\nu \\varphi\\, d\\sigma_g$ vanishes, so integration by parts on $B$ produces no boundary term.**\n\nThis statement leverages the zero-trace property of functions in $H^1_0(B)$. For Green's identity to be meaningful for a non-smooth function $u \\in H^1(B)$ and a smooth function $\\varphi \\in C^\\infty(\\overline{B})$, the boundary integral must be interpreted in terms of the trace of $u$. The integral becomes a pairing between the trace of $u$, which is in $H^{1/2}(\\partial B)$, and the function $\\partial_\\nu\\varphi$, which is smooth on $\\partial B$ and thus certainly in $L^2(\\partial B)$ (and is in the dual space $H^{-1/2}(\\partial B)$). The statement that $u \\in H^1_0(B)$ has zero trace means that its trace is the zero element in $H^{1/2}(\\partial B)$. The integral (or pairing) of the zero function against any other valid function (like $\\partial_\\nu \\varphi$) is necessarily zero. Therefore, the boundary term vanishes. This provides a direct and correct justification.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Because $u\\in H^1_0(B)$ forces $\\Delta_g u\\equiv 0$ in $B$, there is no need to integrate by parts to estimate gradient terms.**\n\nThis statement is factually incorrect. A function $u \\in H^1_0(B)$ is not, in general, harmonic (i.e., $\\Delta_g u = 0$). The space $H^1_0(B)$ is precisely the function space used to find weak solutions to the Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, $\\Delta_g u = f$ in $B$ with $u=0$ on $\\partial B$, where $f$ can be a non-zero function. For a non-zero forcing term $f$, the solution $u$ will not be harmonic. The condition $u \\in H^1_0(B)$ imposes a condition on the boundary behavior of the function, not a differential equation that it must satisfy in the interior of the domain.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Because $u\\in H^1_0(B)$ guarantees that $\\operatorname{Vol}_g(B)$ is finite, boundary terms cannot occur in integration by parts.**\n\nThis statement contains a logical fallacy. The domain $B$ is specified to be a relatively compact geodesic ball. Any relatively compact subset of a Riemannian manifold has a finite volume. This property, $\\operatorname{Vol}_g(B) < \\infty$, is a feature of the domain $B$ itself and is entirely independent of the choice of function space $H^1_0(B)$ defined on it. Furthermore, the finiteness of the volume of $B$ does not imply that boundary integrals will vanish. For a general function $v \\in H^1(B)$ with a non-zero trace on $\\partial B$, the boundary term in Green's identity would be non-zero, despite $\\operatorname{Vol}_g(B)$ being finite. The reasoning is flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Because $H^1_0(B)$ is the closure of $C_c^\\infty(B)$ in $H^1(B)$, one can approximate $u$ by smooth compactly supported functions $u_k$ in $B$ for which the boundary term is identically zero; passing to the limit preserves the boundary-free integration by parts identity.**\n\nThis statement describes the fundamental procedure by which Green's identity is proven for functions in $H^1_0(B)$. By the definition of $H^1_0(B)$, for any $u \\in H^1_0(B)$, there exists a sequence $\\{u_k\\}_{k=1}^\\infty \\subset C_c^\\infty(B)$ such that $u_k \\to u$ in the $H^1(B)$ norm. For each function $u_k$ in this sequence, because it has compact support *strictly inside* $B$, it is identically zero on and near the boundary $\\partial B$. Thus, for any smooth $\\varphi$, Green's identity for $u_k$ is\n$$\n\\int_B \\langle \\nabla u_k,\\nabla \\varphi\\rangle_g \\, d\\mu_g \\;=\\; -\\int_B u_k \\,\\Delta_g \\varphi \\, d\\mu_g\n$$\nas the boundary term $\\int_{\\partial B} u_k \\,\\partial_\\nu \\varphi \\, d\\sigma_g$ is zero. By the continuity of the inner products in $L^2(B)$, we can take the limit as $k \\to \\infty$ on both sides of this equation. Since $u_k \\to u$ and $\\nabla u_k \\to \\nabla u$ in the respective $L^2$ norms, the identity holds for $u$:\n$$\n\\int_B \\langle \\nabla u,\\nabla \\varphi\\rangle_g \\, d\\mu_g \\;=\\; -\\int_B u \\,\\Delta_g \\varphi \\, d\\mu_g\n$$\nThis density argument is the foundational reason why integration by parts on $H^1_0(B)$ does not produce a boundary term. It provides a complete and correct justification.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nBoth statements A and D provide correct justifications. They represent two equivalent perspectives: D explains the justification starting from the definition of the space $H^1_0(B)$, while A explains it starting from the zero-trace property, which is a primary consequence of that definition.

In any such neighborhood, a smooth Riemannian manifold can be approximated by its tangent space, which is $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\nMore formally, in normal coordinates centered at a point $p \\in S^{n}$, the metric tensor satisfies $g_{ij}(x) = \\delta_{ij} + O(|x|^{2})$ and the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\\Delta$ agrees with the Euclidean Laplacian $\\Delta_{\\text{Euc}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x_i^2}$ to leading order.

This implies that the geometry is the same at every point, and consequently the on-diagonal heat kernel $p_{t}^{S^{n}}(x,x)$ must be independent of $x \\in S^{n}$. Therefore, the limit $L_{S^{n}}(n) = \\lim_{t\\to 0^{+}}t^{\\frac{n}{2}}\\,p_{t}^{S^{n}}(x,x)$ exists, is independent of $x$, and is given by this universal leading-order behavior.\n$$\nL_{S^{n}}(n) = (4\\pi)^{-\\frac{n}{2}}.\n$$\nThe explicit calculation for $\\mathbb{T}^{n}$ serves as a concrete verification of this general principle on a manifold that is locally Euclidean everywhere.\n\nThird, we explain the connection to the Nash inequality, which states that for a smooth function $u$, $\\|u\\|_{L^{2}}^{1+\\frac{2}{n}}\\leq C_{N}\\,\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^{2}}\\,\\|u\\|_{L^{1}}^{\\frac{2}{n}}$.

The $L^{1}$-norm is conserved for non-negative solutions, $\\|u_t\\|_{L^1} = \\|f\\|_{L^1}$.\nConsider the evolution of the $L^2$-norm squared, $E(t) = \\|u_t\\|_{L^2}^2$.\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int u_t^2 dV = 2 \\int u_t (\\Delta u_t) dV = -2 \\int |\\nabla u_t|^2 dV = -2 \\|\\nabla u_t\\|_{L^2}^2.\n$$\nFrom the Nash inequality, we have $\\|\\nabla u_t\\|_{L^2}^2 \\ge C_N^{-2} \\|u_t\\|_{L^2}^{2(1+2/n)} \\|u_t\\|_{L^1}^{-4/n}$. Substituting this into the derivative gives a differential inequality for $E(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dt} \\le -2 C_N^{-2} E(t)^{1+2/n} \\|f\\|_{L^1}^{-4/n}.\n$$\nThis is of the form $y' \\le -K y^{1+\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha = 2/n$. Solving this implies a decay rate for $E(t)$, which leads to an $L^1 \\to L^2$ estimate for the semigroup: $\\|e^{t\\Delta}f\\|_{L^2} \\le C_1 t^{-n/4} \\|f\\|_{L^1}$.\nBy duality, the operator norm of $e^{t\\Delta}: L^2 \\to L^\\infty$ is the same as its norm from $L^1 \\to L^2$. Thus, $\\|e^{t\\Delta}f\\|_{L^\\infty} \\le C_1 t^{-n/4} \\|f\\|_{L^2}$.\nUsing the semigroup property $e^{t\\Delta} = e^{t/2\\Delta} \\circ e^{t/2\\Delta}$, we can compose these two estimates:\n$$\n\\|e^{t\\Delta}f\\|_{L^\\infty} = \\|e^{t/2\\Delta}(e^{t/2\\Delta}f)\\|_{L^\\infty} \\le C_1 (t/2)^{-n/4} \\|e^{t/2\\Delta}f\\|_{L^2} \\le C_1 (t/2)^{-n/4} \\cdot C_1 (t/2)^{-n/4} \\|f\\|_{L^1}.\n$$\nThis simplifies to $\\|e^{t\\Delta}f\\|_{L^\\infty} \\le C t^{-n/2} \\|f\\|_{L^1}$ for some constant $C$. This is the $L^1 \\to L^\\infty$ smoothing bound. The operator norm $\\|e^{t\\Delta}\\|_{L^1 \\to L^\\infty}$ is given by the supremum of its integral kernel, $\\sup_{x,y} p_t(x,y)$, which on a compact manifold equals $\\sup_x p_t(x,x)$.\nTherefore, the Nash inequality implies that $\\sup_x p_t(x,x) \\le C t^{-n/2}$. This is perfectly consistent with the asymptotic behavior $p_t(x,x) \\sim L(n)t^{-n/2}$ that we computed. The Nash inequality correctly predicts the sharp dimensional-dependent rate $t^{-n/2}$ of the short-time smoothing, while a direct calculation or local geometry argument is needed to find the precise coefficient $L(n)$.\n\nThe common closed-form value $L(n) = L_{\\mathbb{T}^{n}}(n)=L_{S^{n}}(n)$ is therefore:\n$$\nL(n) = (4\\pi)^{-\\frac{n}{2}}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(4\\pi)^{-\\frac{n}{2}}}$$", "id": "3073284"}]}
