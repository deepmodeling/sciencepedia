## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The theoretical framework of [varifolds](@entry_id:199701) and Brakke flow, developed in the preceding chapters, provides a rigorous language for describing geometric objects and their evolution, particularly in contexts where smoothness may fail. While the concepts are abstract, their purpose is eminently practical: to provide powerful tools for solving concrete problems in geometric analysis and to model complex phenomena in other scientific disciplines. This chapter explores a range of these applications, demonstrating the utility of the measure-theoretic approach in proving the existence of minimal surfaces, in analyzing the formation of singularities in [geometric flows](@entry_id:198994), and in building connections to [partial differential equations](@entry_id:143134) and materials science.

### Existence and Regularity in the Calculus of Variations

A classical problem in mathematics, dating back to Joseph-Louis Lagrange and famously posed by Joseph Plateau, asks for the existence of a surface of least area spanning a given boundary. This problem, modeled physically by soap films, is a central question in the [calculus of variations](@entry_id:142234). The primary modern tool for proving the [existence of minimizers](@entry_id:199472) for a functional like area is [the direct method in the calculus of variations](@entry_id:188864). This method requires three essential ingredients: a class of admissible objects, a [compactness theorem](@entry_id:148512) for sequences within that class, and the [lower semicontinuity](@entry_id:195138) of the functional with respect to the chosen mode of convergence.

The space of smooth surfaces is inadequate for this purpose, as a sequence of smooth surfaces minimizing area can converge to a limit with singularities, which falls outside the space of smooth objects. The theory of [varifolds](@entry_id:199701) and [integral currents](@entry_id:201630) provides the ideal functional analytic setting to overcome this difficulty. By representing surfaces as measures, one gains access to powerful compactness theorems from [measure theory](@entry_id:139744). Specifically, for a sequence of $m$-dimensional integral [varifolds](@entry_id:199701) or currents whose masses (areas) are uniformly bounded, compactness theorems guarantee the existence of a subsequence that converges to a limit object. Crucially, the mass functional is lower semicontinuous with respect to this convergence: the mass of the limit object is no more than the [limit inferior](@entry_id:145282) of the masses of the sequence elements. This property ensures that if one starts with an area-minimizing sequence, the limit object produced by the [compactness theorem](@entry_id:148512) will itself be an area minimizer. This elegant argument robustly establishes the existence of solutions to the Plateau problem in a very general setting [@problem_id:3077631].

The success of the direct method hinges on powerful technical results that ensure the compactness of sequences and the geometric integrity of the limit. One of the cornerstones of this theory is Allard's [compactness theorem](@entry_id:148512). This theorem addresses the question of what properties are preserved under weak convergence of [varifolds](@entry_id:199701). A uniform bound on mass alone is sufficient to extract a convergent subsequence, but the limit may be a "diffuse" measure with no resemblance to a surface. Allard's theorem provides the crucial additional ingredient: if a sequence of integral [varifolds](@entry_id:199701) has not only uniformly bounded mass but also uniformly bounded [first variation](@entry_id:174697) (a measure-theoretic notion of [mean curvature](@entry_id:162147)) on [compact sets](@entry_id:147575), then the limit of any convergent subsequence is also an integral [varifold](@entry_id:194011). In essence, controlling the mean curvature prevents the sequence from developing non-rectifiable, fractal-like structures in the limit, ensuring the limit object retains its essential $m$-dimensional character [@problem_id:3077622].

Another indispensable tool in [geometric measure theory](@entry_id:187987), often used in conjunction with compactness arguments, is the technique of slicing and the [coarea formula](@entry_id:162087). Many geometric properties can be established by induction on dimension. The [coarea formula](@entry_id:162087) provides the machinery for such arguments. By slicing an $m$-dimensional [varifold](@entry_id:194011) with the level sets of a function, one obtains a family of $(m-1)$-dimensional [varifolds](@entry_id:199701). The [coarea formula](@entry_id:162087) provides a precise quantitative relationship between the mass of the original [varifold](@entry_id:194011) and the average mass of its slices. This allows one to translate a uniform mass bound in dimension $m$ into control over the masses of slices in dimension $m-1$, enabling inductive arguments for compactness and other geometric properties [@problem_id:3077633].

Finally, the theory extends beyond mere existence to the question of regularity: is an area-minimizing [varifold](@entry_id:194011) found by the direct method actually a smooth surface? The theory of $\varepsilon$-regularity provides a profound affirmative answer, away from a small [singular set](@entry_id:187696). A key result, first established by Brakke, states that if a [varifold](@entry_id:194011) is sufficiently close to being a flat plane on a given scale, then it must be a smooth graph on a smaller scale. This "closeness" is measured in a weak, [scale-invariant](@entry_id:178566) sense, for instance, by requiring that the integrated square of the mean curvature and the normalized "height excess" (the $L^2$-deviation from a plane) are both smaller than a universal constant $\varepsilon$. If these conditions are met in a parabolic cylinder, an iterative argument shows that the [varifold](@entry_id:194011) becomes progressively flatter at smaller scales, leading to $C^{1,\alpha}$ and ultimately smooth regularity. This "improvement of flatness" is a powerful paradigm in [geometric analysis](@entry_id:157700), demonstrating that strong regularity conclusions can be derived from weak initial assumptions [@problem_id:3077644].

### The Analysis of Geometric Flows and Singularities

The machinery of [varifolds](@entry_id:199701) finds its most extensive application in the study of [geometric evolution equations](@entry_id:636858), most notably [mean curvature flow](@entry_id:184231) (MCF). In this flow, a surface evolves in the direction of its [mean curvature vector](@entry_id:199617), acting to decrease its surface area as quickly as possible. While smooth for short times, MCF is known to develop singularities, where the curvature blows up and the classical flow ceases to be well-defined.

Brakke flow was introduced to provide a rigorous [weak formulation](@entry_id:142897) of MCF that can handle the formation of singularities and continue the evolution beyond them. A Brakke flow is a one-parameter family of [varifolds](@entry_id:199701) whose evolution satisfies the "Brakke inequality." This inequality is the integral version of the evolution equation for [area density](@entry_id:636104) under smooth MCF, but with the equality replaced by a "$\le$" sign. This change is crucial, as it allows for the sudden loss of area that can occur when a singularity forms, for example, when a sphere shrinks to a point and its area vanishes instantaneously [@problem_id:2983844].

The justification for Brakke flow as the correct generalization of smooth MCF comes from a deep result rooted in Huisken's [monotonicity formula](@entry_id:203421). For any smooth MCF, this formula states that a specific weighted area, where the weight is given by a [backward heat kernel](@entry_id:193390) centered at a future spacetime point $(x_0, t_0)$, is a non-increasing function of time [@problem_id:3077637]. This monotonicity provides a uniform bound on the mass of the evolving surface in any spacetime neighborhood. By the compactness theorems for [varifolds](@entry_id:199701), this bound guarantees that as a smooth flow approaches a singular time, one can extract a subsequence of the underlying [varifolds](@entry_id:199701) that converges to a limit. This limit can be shown to be a Brakke flow. Thus, Brakke flows arise as the natural limits of smooth flows, providing a framework that is closed under the limiting processes that produce singularities [@problem_id:3070591].

With a rigorous theory of [weak solutions](@entry_id:161732) in hand, one can analyze the structure of the singularities themselves. The primary technique is [blow-up analysis](@entry_id:187686), which involves performing a [parabolic rescaling](@entry_id:193785) of the flow centered at a singular point. As one "zooms in" on the singularity in spacetime, the rescaled flows converge to a limit known as a tangent flow, which serves as an [infinitesimal model](@entry_id:181362) of the singularity. The language of [varifolds](@entry_id:199701) is essential for proving the existence of these limits [@problem_id:3077617]. For a smooth point on a manifold, this procedure simply yields its tangent plane. However, at a singularity, the tangent flow is a non-trivial, complete, eternal solution to MCF. For the most common class of singularities, known as Type I, the tangent flow is a self-shrinking solution to MCF, or a "[self-shrinker](@entry_id:184154)." This reduces the classification of these complex singularities to the more tractable problem of classifying [self-similar solutions](@entry_id:164839), such as shrinking spheres, cylinders, and other exotic surfaces [@problem_id:3065358].

The theory comes full circle by connecting the [monotonicity formula](@entry_id:203421) to regularity. The limit of the monotone quantity from Huisken's formula at a spacetime point $(x_0, t_0)$ is called the Gaussian density. This density is a measure of the concentration of area at the point. A key result states that this density is equal to the density of the tangent flow at the origin. Since a flat plane has density 1, and any singular [self-shrinker](@entry_id:184154) can be shown to have a density strictly greater than 1, this provides a powerful regularity criterion. The $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem states that if the Gaussian density at a point is less than $1+\varepsilon$ for a small universal $\varepsilon$, the tangent flow must be a plane, which in turn implies the original flow was smooth in a neighborhood of that point. This provides a clear, quantitative distinction between regular points and [singular points](@entry_id:266699) [@problem_id:3077613].

### Interdisciplinary Connections

The concepts and tools developed for [varifolds](@entry_id:199701) and Brakke flow have had a significant impact on fields beyond pure geometry, including the theory of [partial differential equations](@entry_id:143134) and materials science.

#### Connections to Partial Differential Equations: The Level-Set Method

An entirely different approach to defining [weak solutions](@entry_id:161732) for MCF is the [level-set method](@entry_id:165633), developed by Osher and Sethian. In this framework, the evolving surface is represented as the zero [level set](@entry_id:637056) of a function $u(x,t)$, which evolves according to a nonlinear PDE. This method is exceptionally robust and popular in numerical simulations. However, it can exhibit a [pathology](@entry_id:193640) known as "fattening," where the zero level set develops a non-empty interior, leading to non-uniqueness and a loss of the notion of a sharp interface. A profound connection between the two weak solution theories resolves this issue for a large class of surfaces. For initial surfaces that are [mean-convex](@entry_id:193370) (their mean curvature is non-negative), it can be proven that the weak flow defined by the [level-set method](@entry_id:165633) coincides with the unique Brakke flow constructed via the "minimizing hull" method from [geometric measure theory](@entry_id:187987). Since the GMT flow is known not to fatten, this identity guarantees that the [level-set](@entry_id:751248) flow does not fatten for [mean-convex](@entry_id:193370) initial data, providing a beautiful bridge between the [viscosity solution](@entry_id:198358) theory of PDEs and the measure-theoretic framework of GMT [@problem_id:3027454].

#### Connections to Materials Science: The Allen-Cahn Equation

A striking application of [mean curvature flow](@entry_id:184231) and its weak formulations is found in the modeling of phase transitions. The Allen-Cahn equation is a [reaction-diffusion equation](@entry_id:275361) that models the process of phase separation in materials like binary alloys. The solution $u(x,t)$ is an "order parameter" that takes distinct values (e.g., $+1$ and $-1$) in the bulk phases, with a smooth transition layer, or "diffuse interface," between them. The thickness of this layer is controlled by a small parameter $\varepsilon$.

A formal matched [asymptotic analysis](@entry_id:160416) shows that in the sharp-interface limit, as $\varepsilon \to 0$, the interface evolves with a normal velocity proportional to its mean curvature, $v_n = -\kappa$. This reveals that the Allen-Cahn equation is a [phase-field model](@entry_id:178606) for [mean curvature flow](@entry_id:184231) [@problem_id:3031792]. The theory of [varifolds](@entry_id:199701) provides the rigorous framework to prove this convergence. The energy of the Allen-Cahn solution concentrates along the interface, and as $\varepsilon \to 0$, the corresponding energy measures converge in the sense of [varifolds](@entry_id:199701) to a Brakke flow.

This connection allows the powerful tools of [geometric analysis](@entry_id:157700) to be applied to a physical problem. Singular events in the limiting MCF, such as the merging of two domains or the pinching of a neck, correspond to periods of rapid energy rearrangement in the Allen-Cahn model. The [blow-up analysis](@entry_id:187686) developed for MCF can be adapted to the Allen-Cahn solutions near these events. By performing a [parabolic rescaling](@entry_id:193785) at a scale much larger than the interface thickness $\varepsilon$, one can show that the rescaled energy measures converge to a tangent flow of the MCF, revealing the universal, self-similar structure that governs the singular phase transition [@problem_id:3032496]. This provides deep insight into the multi-scale nature of these physical processes, illustrating the far-reaching power of [geometric measure theory](@entry_id:187987).
