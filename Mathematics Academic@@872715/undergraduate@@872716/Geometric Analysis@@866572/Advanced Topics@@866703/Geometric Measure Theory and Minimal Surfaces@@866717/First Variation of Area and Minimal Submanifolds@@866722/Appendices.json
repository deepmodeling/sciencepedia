This proves that the catenoid is not always a global area minimizer.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For the neck region $|z|\\le z_0$ of the catenoid, the area difference between the removed catenoid segment and the two capping disks equals $\\pi a^2\\!\\left(2\\,\\tfrac{z_0}{a} - 1 - e^{-2 z_0/a}\\right)$, which is positive for some $z_00$. Therefore, for any $H \\ge z_0$ with such a choice of $z_0$, the competitor $\\widetilde{\\Sigma}_{H,z_0}$ has strictly smaller area than $\\Sigma_H$, and the catenoid is not globally area-minimizing for its boundary.**\n- The formula for the area difference is correct.\n- The claim that this difference is positive for some $z_0  0$ is correct.\n- The conclusion that for a sufficiently large catenoid, the competitor surface has smaller area, thereby invalidating global minimality, is correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. For the neck region $|z|\\le z_0$ of the catenoid, the area difference between the removed catenoid segment and the two capping disks equals $\\pi a^2\\!\\left(1 + e^{-2 z_0/a} - 2\\,\\tfrac{z_0}{a}\\right)$, which is nonnegative for all $z_00$. Therefore, the catenoid neck always has area at most that of the two disks, and the catenoid is globally area-minimizing among all competitors.**\n- The formula for the area difference is incorrect.\n- The conclusion is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The cut-and-paste competitor $\\widetilde{\\Sigma}_{H,z_0}$ is inadmissible for area comparison because it is not smooth across the gluing circles and is disconnected; hence one cannot use it to invalidate global minimality of the catenoid.**\n- In the calculus of variations, the class of admissible competitors is broad and includes non-smooth and disconnected surfaces. The argument is valid.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Because the catenoid has zero mean curvature, every compact truncation $\\Sigma_H$ minimizes area among all surfaces with the same boundary $\\Gamma_H^+ \\cup \\Gamma_H^-$; therefore no cut-and-paste competitor can have smaller area than $\\Sigma_H$.**\n- This incorrectly equates the local property of being minimal ($H=0$) with the global property of being area-minimizing.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3048578"}]}
