The problem specifies that the solution should be derived from foundational principles concerning space forms and curvature contractions.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Manifold**: A $3$-sphere of radius $r  0$, denoted as $S^{3}(r) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{4}$.\n- **Metric**: The round metric $g_{r}$ induced from the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$.\n- **Dimension**: The dimension of the manifold is $n=3$.\n- **Task**: Compute the Ricci tensor $\\mathrm{Ric}(g_{r})$ and scalar curvature $R(g_{r})$.\n- **Methodological Constraint**: Use only foundational facts about space forms and curvature contractions.\n- **Output Format**: Express answers in terms of $r$ and $g_{r}$, stating the scaling with $r$. The final answer should be a pair $(\\mathrm{Ric}(g_{r}), R(g_{r}))$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is a standard, fundamental calculation in Riemannian geometry. The object $(S^{3}(r), g_{r})$ is a well-defined Riemannian manifold. All concepts (Ricci tensor, scalar curvature) are central to the field. The context given (\"Hamilton-Perelman's program\") is appropriate, as understanding the curvature of spheres is a prerequisite for studying Ricci flow. The problem is scientifically and mathematically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: For a given Riemannian metric, the Riemann, Ricci, and scalar curvatures are uniquely determined. The problem is therefore well-posed.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous mathematical language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in differential geometry that can be solved using the prescribed methods.\n\nWe now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe manifold $(S^{3}(r), g_{r})$ is a canonical example of a Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature. This is a foundational fact about space forms. The dimension of the manifold is $n=3$. For a sphere of radius $r$ embedded in a Euclidean space, the constant sectional curvature $K$ is given by:\n$$K = \\frac{1}{r^2}$$\n\nFor any $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ with constant sectional curvature $K$, the Riemann curvature tensor, $\\mathrm{Riem}$, has a specific algebraic structure. In component notation, with respect to any local coordinate system, it is given by:\n$$R_{ijkl} = K(g_{ik}g_{jl} - g_{il}g_{jk})$$\nwhere $R_{ijkl} = g_{im}R^m_{\\;jkl}$ are the components of the $(0,4)$-Riemann tensor.\n\n**1. Computation of the Ricci Tensor**\n\nThe Ricci tensor, $\\mathrm{Ric}$, is obtained by performing a contraction on the Riemann tensor. Its components $\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij}$ are defined as:\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij} = g^{lk}R_{lijk}$$\nNote that the contraction is over the first and third indices of the $(0,4)$-tensor $R_{lijk}$. We substitute the expression for the Riemann tensor of a constant curvature space:\n$$R_{lijk} = K(g_{li}g_{kj} - g_{lk}g_{ij})$$\nThe computation of the Ricci tensor components is as follows:\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij} = g^{lk} [K(g_{li}g_{kj} - g_{lk}g_{ij})]$$\nBy linearity of the contraction, we can distribute $g^{lk}$ and factor out the constant $K$:\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij} = K [g^{lk}(g_{li}g_{kj}) - g^{lk}(g_{lk}g_{ij})]$$\nWe evaluate the two terms inside the brackets separately.\nFor the first term:\n$$g^{lk}g_{li}g_{kj} = (g^{lk}g_{li})g_{kj}$$\nThe contraction $g^{lk}g_{li}$ is, by definition of the inverse metric, the Kronecker delta $\\delta^k_i$. So,\n$$(g^{lk}g_{li})g_{kj} = \\delta^k_i g_{kj} = g_{ij}$$\nFor the second term:\n$$g^{lk}g_{lk}g_{ij}$$\nThe contraction $g^{lk}g_{lk}$ is the trace of the identity tensor, which is the dimension of the manifold, $n$.\n$$g^{lk}g_{lk} = \\delta^k_k = \\sum_{k=1}^n 1 = n$$\nSo, the second term is $n g_{ij}$.\n\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij}$:\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij} = K [g_{ij} - n g_{ij}] = -(n-1)K g_{ij}$$\nThere appears to be a sign error in the derivation due to index convention. Let's re-verify the standard convention. The Ricci tensor is $R_{ik} = R^j_{ijk}$. This means $R_{ik} = g^{jl}R_{lijk}$. Let's use this standard definition. We need $R_{lijk} = K(g_{lk}g_{ij} - g_{li}g_{jk})$ as derived from $R_{ijkl} = K(g_{ik}g_{jl} - g_{il}g_{jk})$ by swapping $i \\leftrightarrow l$.\nSo, $\\mathrm{Ric}_{ik} = g^{jl}R_{lijk} = g^{jl} K (g_{li} g_{jk} - g_{lj} g_{ik})$.\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{ik} = K( g^{jl}g_{li} g_{jk} - g^{jl}g_{lj} g_{ik} ) $$\n$$= K( (g^{jl}g_{li}) g_{jk} - (g^{jl}g_{lj}) g_{ik} ) $$\n$$= K( \\delta^j_i g_{jk} - \\delta^j_j g_{ik} ) $$\n$$= K( g_{ik} - n g_{ik} ) = -(n-1)K g_{ik}$$\nAnother sign issue. Let us be meticulous. The standard definition of the Riemann tensor is $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z$. The components are $R^l_{kij}$. For constant sectional curvature $K$, $R_{ijkl} = K(g_{il}g_{jk} - g_{ik}g_{jl})$. The Ricci tensor is $\\mathrm{Ric}_{ik} = R^j_{ijk} = g^{jl}R_{jlik}$.\nLet's use this definition:\n$$R_{jlik} = K(g_{jl}g_{ik} - g_{jk}g_{il})$$\nNow contract:\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{ik} = g^{jl} R_{jlik} = g^{jl} K (g_{jl}g_{ik} - g_{jk}g_{il})$$\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{ik} = K [ (g^{jl}g_{jl}) g_{ik} - g^{jl}g_{jk}g_{il} ]$$\nThe term $g^{jl}g_{jl} = \\delta^l_l = n$.\nThe term $g^{jl}g_{jk}g_{il} = (g^{jl}g_{jk})g_{il} = \\delta^l_k g_{il} = g_{ik}$.\nSo,\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}_{ik} = K [ n g_{ik} - g_{ik} ] = (n-1)K g_{ik}$$\nThis is the correct, standard result. In tensor notation, this is $\\mathrm{Ric} = (n-1)K g$.\n\nFor the specific case of $(S^{3}(r), g_{r})$, we have $n=3$ and $K = 1/r^{2}$. The metric is $g_{r}$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}(g_{r}) = (3-1) \\frac{1}{r^{2}} g_{r} = \\frac{2}{r^{2}} g_{r}$$\nThe Ricci tensor is a tensor field that is pointwise proportional to the metric tensor. The constant of proportionality, $2/r^2$, scales as the inverse square of the radius $r$.\n\n**2. Computation of the Scalar Curvature**\n\nThe scalar curvature, $R$, is obtained by contracting the Ricci tensor with the inverse metric:\n$$R = g^{ij}\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij}$$\nUsing the general expression for the Ricci tensor components we just derived, $\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij} = (n-1)K g_{ij}$:\n$$R = g^{ij} [ (n-1)K g_{ij} ]$$\n$$R = (n-1)K (g^{ij}g_{ij})$$\nThe contraction $g^{ij}g_{ij} = \\delta^j_j = n$. Therefore:\n$$R = n(n-1)K$$\nThis is the general formula for the scalar curvature of an $n$-dimensional space of constant sectional curvature $K$.\n\nFor the specific case of $(S^{3}(r), g_{r})$, we substitute $n=3$ and $K=1/r^2$:\n$$R(g_{r}) = 3(3-1) \\frac{1}{r^{2}} = 3(2) \\frac{1}{r^{2}} = \\frac{6}{r^{2}}$$\nThe scalar curvature is a constant function on the sphere with value $6/r^{2}$. This value scales as the inverse square of the radius $r$.\n\nThe two required quantities are $\\mathrm{Ric}(g_{r}) = \\frac{2}{r^2} g_{r}$ and $R(g_{r}) = \\frac{6}{r^2}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{r^{2}} g_{r}  \\frac{6}{r^{2}} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "3051561"}, {"introduction": "Having established the static curvature of the 3-sphere, we now set it in motion using the Ricci flow.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe unnormalized Ricci flow is governed by the partial differential equation:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = -2 \\operatorname{Ric}(g(t))\n$$\nwhere $g(t)$ is the time-dependent Riemannian metric and $\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t))$ is its Ricci tensor.\n\nThe problem states that we are on the $3$-sphere, $S^3$, so the dimension is $n=3$. The solution is assumed to remain within the family of round metrics. Thus, the metric at any time $t \\ge 0$ can be written as:\n$$\ng(t) = r(t)^2 g_{\\mathrm{round}}\n$$\nwhere $r(t)$ is the radius of the sphere at time $t$, and $g_{\\mathrm{round}}$ is the standard round metric on $S^3$ with constant sectional curvature equal to $1$. The initial condition is given by $g(0) = r_0^2 g_{\\mathrm{round}}$, which implies $r(0) = r_0$.\n\nOur first step is to compute the left-hand side of the Ricci flow equation. We differentiate $g(t)$ with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = \\partial_{t} \\left( r(t)^2 g_{\\mathrm{round}} \\right)\n$$\nSince $g_{\\mathrm{round}}$ is a fixed background metric, it is independent of time.

This requires finding the Ricci tensor of the metric $g(t)$. The metric $g(t) = r(t)^2 g_{\\mathrm{round}}$ corresponds to a sphere of radius $r(t)$. According to the problem statement, a sphere of radius $r$ has constant sectional curvature $K = 1/r^2$. Therefore, the metric $g(t)$ has constant sectional curvature $K(t) = 1/r(t)^2$.\n\nThe problem also provides the formula for the Ricci tensor of a metric with constant sectional curvature $K$ in dimension $n$: $\\operatorname{Ric} = (n-1) K g$.
