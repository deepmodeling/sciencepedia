The derivation must rely on the foundational definitions of complex differential geometry.\n\nFirst, we establish the definition of the Kähler form $\\omega$ derived from a Kähler potential $\\phi$. On a complex manifold, a Kähler form is a real, closed $(1,1)$-form that is positive definite. Given a real-valued smooth function $\\phi$, which serves as the potential, the associated two-form is constructed using the Dolbeault operators $\\partial$ and $\\bar{\\partial}$. A standard definition, which we adopt here, is:\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{i}{2} \\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\phi\n$$\nThis normalization is chosen such that for the given potential on $\\mathbb{C}^n$, it yields the standard flat Kähler form. The exterior derivative on a complex manifold decomposes as $d = \\partial + \\bar{\\partial}$.\n\nThe given Kähler potential is $\\phi: \\mathbb{C}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, defined as $\\phi(z) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} |z_k|^2$. Using the complex coordinates $z_k$ and their conjugates $\\bar{z}_k$, we can write $|z_k|^2 = z_k \\bar{z}_k$. Thus, the potential is:\n$$\n\\phi(z) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} z_j \\bar{z}_j\n$$\nOur derivation proceeds in two main steps: first, we compute the term $\\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\phi$, and second, we verify that the resulting form $\\omega$ is closed.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of the Kähler form $\\omega$**\n\nWe begin by applying the operator $\\bar{\\partial}$ to the potential $\\phi$. For a smooth function $f$, the action of $\\bar{\\partial}$ is defined in local coordinates as:\n$$\n\\bar{\\partial} f = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\bar{z}_k} d\\bar{z}_k\n$$\nApplying this to $\\phi$, we first compute the partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial \\bar{z}_k}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial \\bar{z}_k} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}_k} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{n} z_j \\bar{z}_j \\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} z_j \\frac{\\partial \\bar{z}_j}{\\partial \\bar{z}_k} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} z_j \\delta_{jk} = z_k\n$$\nHere, $\\delta_{jk}$ is the Kronecker delta. Substituting this result into the expression for $\\bar{\\partial}\\phi$, we obtain a $(0,1)$-form:\n$$\n\\bar{\\partial} \\phi = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} z_k d\\bar{z}_k\n$$\nNext, we apply the operator $\\partial$ to the resulting $1$-form $\\bar{\\partial}\\phi$. For a general $p$-form $\\alpha$, the action of $\\partial$ follows the graded Leibniz rule. For a $1$-form such as $\\alpha = \\sum_k f_k d\\bar{z}_k$, we have $\\partial\\alpha = \\sum_k (\\partial f_k) \\wedge d\\bar{z}_k$. More generally, for a form that is a product of a function and a form, $\\partial(f \\wedge \\eta) = (\\partial f) \\wedge \\eta + f \\wedge (\\partial \\eta)$.\nApplying this to $\\bar{\\partial}\\phi = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} z_k d\\bar{z}_k$:\n$$\n\\partial(\\bar{\\partial}\\phi) = \\partial \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{n} z_k d\\bar{z}_k \\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\partial(z_k d\\bar{z}_k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\left( (\\partial z_k) \\wedge d\\bar{z}_k + z_k \\wedge \\partial(d\\bar{z}_k) \\right)\n$$\nWe evaluate each term in the sum. The first term involves $\\partial z_k$. Applying the definition $\\partial f = \\sum_j \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z_j} dz_j$:\n$$\n\\partial z_k = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial z_k}{\\partial z_j} dz_j = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\delta_{kj} dz_j = dz_k\n$$\nThe second term involves $\\partial(d\\bar{z}_k)$. We use the fundamental properties of the Dolbeault operators, which stem from the identity $d^2 = 0$. Since $d = \\partial + \\bar{\\partial}$, we have $d^2 = (\\partial+\\bar{\\partial})^2 = \\partial^2 + \\partial\\bar{\\partial} + \\bar{\\partial}\\partial + \\bar{\\partial}^2 = 0$. When acting on forms of specific bidegrees, this decomposes into the separate identities $\\partial^2=0$, $\\bar{\\partial}^2=0$, and $\\partial\\bar{\\partial} + \\bar{\\partial}\\partial = 0$.\nThe term $d\\bar{z}_k$ is equivalent to $\\bar{\\partial}\\bar{z}_k$. Thus we can write:\n$$\n\\partial(d\\bar{z}_k) = \\partial(\\bar{\\partial}\\bar{z}_k)\n$$\nUsing the relation $\\partial\\bar{\\partial} = -\\bar{\\partial}\\partial$, we have:\n$$\n\\partial(\\bar{\\partial}\\bar{z}_k) = -\\bar{\\partial}(\\partial\\bar{z}_k)\n$$\nThe term $\\partial\\bar{z}_k$ is:\n$$\n\\partial\\bar{z}_k = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial \\bar{z}_k}{\\partial z_j} dz_j = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} 0 \\cdot dz_j = 0\n$$\nsince $\\bar{z}_k$ is antiholomorphic and its derivative with respect to any $z_j$ is zero. Therefore, $\\partial(d\\bar{z}_k) = -\\bar{\\partial}(0) = 0$.\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $\\partial(\\bar{\\partial}\\phi)$:\n$$\n\\partial(\\bar{\\partial}\\phi) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\left( dz_k \\wedge d\\bar{z}_k + z_k \\wedge 0 \\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} dz_k \\wedge d\\bar{z}_k\n$$\nThis is a $(1,1)$-form, as expected. Now we can write the final expression for the Kähler form $\\omega$:\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{i}{2} \\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\phi = \\frac{i}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} dz_k \\wedge d\\bar{z}_k\n$$\nThis form is the standard flat Kähler form on $\\mathbb{C}^n$. For completeness, we can express it in real coordinates $z_k = x_k + i y_k$, $d z_k = d x_k + i d y_k$, $d\\bar{z}_k = d x_k - i d y_k$.\n$$\ndz_k \\wedge d\\bar{z}_k = (dx_k + i dy_k) \\wedge (dx_k - i dy_k) = -i dx_k \\wedge dy_k + i dy_k \\wedge dx_k = -2i dx_k \\wedge dy_k\n$$\nSo, $\\omega = \\frac{i}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (-2i \\, dx_k \\wedge dy_k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} dx_k \\wedge dy_k$, which is the standard symplectic form on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$.\n\n**Step 2: Verification that $\\omega$ is closed**\n\nThe problem requires verification that $d\\omega = 0$. We will demonstrate this using the properties of the exterior derivative and Dolbeault operators. The form $\\omega$ is defined as $\\omega = \\frac{i}{2}\\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\phi$.\nConsider the action of the exterior derivative $d = \\partial + \\bar{\\partial}$ on the $1$-form $\\bar{\\partial}\\phi$:\n$$\nd(\\bar{\\partial}\\phi) = (\\partial + \\bar{\\partial})(\\bar{\\partial}\\phi) = \\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\phi + \\bar{\\partial}^2\\phi\n$$\nSince $\\phi$ is a function (a $0$-form), the identity $\\bar{\\partial}^2 = 0$ implies $\\bar{\\partial}^2\\phi = 0$. Thus, we have the important relation:\n$$\nd(\\bar{\\partial}\\phi) = \\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\phi\n$$\nNow, we can rewrite the expression for $\\omega$ as:\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{i}{2} d(\\bar{\\partial}\\phi)\n$$\nThis shows that $\\omega$ is an exact differential form, as it is the exterior derivative of the $1$-form $\\alpha = \\frac{i}{2}\\bar{\\partial}\\phi$. A fundamental property of the exterior derivative is that $d^2 = 0$. Applying $d$ to $\\omega$:\n$$\nd\\omega = d \\left( \\frac{i}{2} d(\\bar{\\partial}\\phi) \\right) = \\frac{i}{2} d^2(\\bar{\\partial}\\phi) = 0\n$$\nThus, $\\omega$ is closed.

As a complex manifold of complex dimension $1$, $M$ is a real manifold of real dimension $d=2$. Let $g$ be the specified Riemannian metric on $M$. The problem states that this metric has constant Gauss curvature $K=1$.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in relating the Ricci tensor, $Ric$, to the metric tensor, $g$, for a $2$-dimensional manifold. For any Riemannian $2$-manifold, there exists a fundamental identity connecting the Ricci tensor, the Gauss curvature, and the metric tensor. This identity is $Ric = K g$.\n\nWe can derive this identity as follows. Let us choose a point $p \\in M$ and a local orthonormal frame $\\{e_1, e_2\\}$ in the tangent space $T_pM$. In this frame, the metric tensor components are $g_{ij} = g(e_i, e_j) = \\delta_{ij}$. The components of the Ricci tensor, $R_{ik}$, are defined by contracting the Riemann curvature tensor, $R_{ijkl}$:\n$$R_{ik} = \\sum_{j=1}^{2} R_{ijkj}$$\nThe components of the Riemann tensor for a $2$-manifold are determined entirely by the Gauss curvature $K$ through the relation:\n$$R_{ijkl} = K(g_{ik}g_{jl} - g_{il}g_{jk})$$\nIn our orthonormal frame, this becomes $R_{ijkl} = K(\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} - \\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk})$.\nLet us compute the components of the Ricci tensor:\nFor $i=k=1$:\n$$R_{11} = R_{1111} + R_{1212}$$\nFrom the formula for the Riemann tensor, $R_{1111} = K(\\delta_{11}\\delta_{11} - \\delta_{11}\\delta_{11}) = 0$. And $R_{1212} = K(\\delta_{11}\\delta_{22} - \\delta_{12}\\delta_{12}) = K(1 \\cdot 1 - 0 \\cdot 0) = K$. Thus, $R_{11} = K$.\n\nFor $i=k=2$:\n$$R_{22} = R_{2121} + R_{2222}$$\nHere, $R_{2222} = 0$, and by the symmetries of the Riemann tensor, $R_{2121} = R_{1212} = K$. Thus, $R_{22} = K$.\n\nFor $i=1, k=2$:\n$$R_{12} = R_{1121} + R_{1222}$$\nHere, $R_{1121} = K(\\delta_{12}\\delta_{11} - \\delta_{11}\\delta_{21}) = K(0 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot 0) = 0$.

By symmetry, $R_{21}=0$.\n\nSo, in this orthonormal basis, the Ricci tensor has the component matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} K & 0 \\\\ 0 & K \\end{pmatrix}$, which can be written as $K \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The metric tensor $g$ has the component matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Therefore, we have established the tensor equation $Ric = K g$.

The definition of an Einstein metric is that its Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric tensor. For a Kähler-Einstein metric, this condition is expressed as:\n$$Ric = \\lambda g$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a real constant known as the Einstein constant.\n\nWe now have two expressions for the Ricci tensor of the given metric:\n1.
