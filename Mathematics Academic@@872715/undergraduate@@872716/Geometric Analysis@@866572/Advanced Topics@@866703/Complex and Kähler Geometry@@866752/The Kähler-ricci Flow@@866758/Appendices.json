First, we must derive the expression for the Kähler form $\\omega$ in complex coordinates. Second, we must directly verify that this form is closed, i.e., $d\\omega = 0$. Third, we must explain the significance of this result in the context of the Kähler-Ricci flow.\n\nWe begin by establishing the relationship between the real coordinates $(x^k, y^k)$ and the complex coordinates $(z^k, \\bar{z}^k)$. The problem states:\n$$z^{k} = x^{k} + \\mathrm{i}\\,y^{k}$$\n$$\\bar{z}^{k} = x^{k} - \\mathrm{i}\\,y^{k}$$\nfor $k = 1, \\dots, n$. We can invert these relations to express the real coordinates in terms of the complex coordinates:\n$$x^{k} = \\frac{1}{2}(z^k + \\bar{z}^k)$$\n$$y^{k} = \\frac{1}{2\\mathrm{i}}(z^k - \\bar{z}^k) = -\\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{2}(z^k - \\bar{z}^k)$$\nNext, we find the corresponding relations for the differentials (covector fields):\n$$dz^{k} = dx^{k} + \\mathrm{i}\\,dy^{k}$$\n$$d\\bar{z}^{k} = dx^{k} - \\mathrm{i}\\,dy^{k}$$\nInverting these, we obtain the real coordinate differentials:\n$$dx^{k} = \\frac{1}{2}(dz^k + d\\bar{z}^k)$$\n$$dy^{k} = \\frac{1}{2\\mathrm{i}}(dz^k - d\\bar{z}^k)$$\n\nThe most direct path to find $\\omega$ is to first express it in real coordinates and then substitute the complex differentials. The problem defines the Kähler form as $\\omega(X,Y) = g(JX, Y)$ for vector fields $X$ and $Y$. The metric is the standard Euclidean metric $g = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (dx^k \\otimes dx^k + dy^k \\otimes dy^k)$, and the complex structure acts as $J(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}$ and $J(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}$.\nLet's compute the components of $\\omega$ on the real coordinate basis vector fields $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^j}\\}$.\nFor any indices $k, l \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$:\n$$\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = g\\left(J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = g\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = \\delta_{kl}$$\n$$\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = g\\left(J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = g\\left(-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = -\\delta_{kl}$$\n$$\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = g\\left(J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = g\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = 0$$\n$$\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = g\\left(J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = g\\left(-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = 0$$\nAs a $2$-form, $\\omega$ is a linear combination of wedge products of basis $1$-forms. Based on the components calculated above, the form is:\n$$\\omega = \\sum_{k=1}^n dx^k \\wedge dy^k$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $dx^k$ and $dy^k$ in terms of $dz^k$ and $d\\bar{z}^k$:\n\\begin{align*} dx^k \\wedge dy^k = \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(dz^k + d\\bar{z}^k) \\right) \\wedge \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\mathrm{i}}(dz^k - d\\bar{z}^k) \\right) \\\\ = \\frac{1}{4\\mathrm{i}} (dz^k + d\\bar{z}^k) \\wedge (dz^k - d\\bar{z}^k) \\\\ = \\frac{1}{4\\mathrm{i}} (dz^k \\wedge dz^k - dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k + d\\bar{z}^k \\wedge dz^k - d\\bar{z}^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k) \\end{align*}\nUsing the properties of the wedge product, $dz^k \\wedge dz^k = 0$, $d\\bar{z}^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k = 0$, and $d\\bar{z}^k \\wedge dz^k = -dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$dx^k \\wedge dy^k = \\frac{1}{4\\mathrm{i}} (-dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k - dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k) = \\frac{-2}{4\\mathrm{i}} dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k = \\frac{-1}{2\\mathrm{i}} dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k$$\nSince $1/\\mathrm{i} = -\\mathrm{i}$, we have:\n$$dx^k \\wedge dy^k = \\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{2} dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k$$\nSumming over all $k$ from $1$ to $n$, we obtain the formula for the Kähler form $\\omega$ in complex coordinates:\n$$\\omega = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{2} dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k = \\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^n dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k$$\n\nFor the second task, we must verify that $d\\omega = 0$ directly. We apply the exterior derivative $d$ to the expression for $\\omega$:\n$$d\\omega = d\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^n dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k\\right)$$\nSince $d$ is a linear operator and commutes with constant coefficients, we can write:\n$$d\\omega = \\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^n d(dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k)$$\nWe use the graded Leibniz rule for the exterior derivative on a wedge product of forms: $d(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = (d\\alpha) \\wedge \\beta + (-1)^p \\alpha \\wedge (d\\beta)$ where $\\alpha$ is a $p$-form. Here, $dz^k$ and $d\\bar{z}^k$ are $1$-forms, so $p=1$.\n$$d(dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k) = d(dz^k) \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k - dz^k \\wedge d(d\\bar{z}^k)$$\nA fundamental property of the exterior derivative is that it is nilpotent, i.e., $d^2 = d \\circ d = 0$. This means that for any smooth function (a $0$-form) $f$, we have $d(df) = 0$. The complex coordinates $z^k$ and $\\bar{z}^k$ are smooth functions on $\\mathbb{C}^n$. Therefore, $dz^k$ is an exact $1$-form, and $d(dz^k)=0$. Similarly, $d(d\\bar{z}^k)=0$.\nSubstituting these into our expression:\n$$d(dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k) = 0 \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k - dz^k \\wedge 0 = 0$$\nThus, each term in the sum for $d\\omega$ is zero, which implies:\n$$d\\omega = \\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^n 0 = 0$$\nThis completes the direct verification that $\\omega$ is a closed form.\n\nFor the third task, we relate this to the Kähler-Ricci flow (KRF). The KRF is an evolution equation for a family of Kähler metrics $g(t)$ on a complex manifold $M$, given by:\n$$\\frac{\\partial g_{i\\bar{j}}(t)}{\\partial t} = -R_{i\\bar{j}}(t)$$\nwhere $g_{i\\bar{j}}$ are the components of the metric tensor in complex coordinates and $R_{i\\bar{j}}$ are the components of its Ricci tensor. An essential requirement for this flow is the existence of an initial Kähler metric $g(0)$. A Hermitian metric $g$ is Kähler if and only if its associated fundamental $2$-form $\\omega$ is closed ($d\\omega=0$). Our verification $d\\omega = 0$ for the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{C}^n$ confirms that it is indeed a Kähler metric, making it a valid initial datum for the KRF.\n\nThe flat Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{C}^n$ is characterized by the fact that its curvature tensor, and therefore its Ricci tensor, is identically zero. Thus, for our initial metric $g(0)$, we have $R_{i\\bar{j}}(0) = 0$. When we substitute this into the KRF equation, we get:\n$$\\frac{\\partial g_{i\\bar{j}}}{\\partial t}\\bigg|_{t=0} = -R_{i\\bar{j}}(0) = 0$$\nThis means the metric does not change at $t=0$. The unique solution to the flow with this initial condition is a static one: $g(t) = g(0)$ for all time $t \\ge 0$. In other words, the flat metric on $\\mathbb{C}^n$ is a fixed point of the Kähler-Ricci flow. It represents the most fundamental example of a Ricci-flat Kähler metric and serves as a canonical, albeit trivial, stationary solution to the flow equation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} dz^k \\wedge d\\bar{z}^k}$$", "id": "3070735"}, {"introduction": "After exploring the flat, non-compact space, we turn to a canonical compact example: complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$.

Now, we substitute the ansatz into the flow equation $\\partial_{t}\\omega^{(c)}(t) = -\\rho(\\omega^{(c)}(t))$.\n    The left-hand side (LHS) is:\n    $$\n    \\text{LHS} = \\partial_{t}\\omega^{(c)}(t) = \\partial_{t}\\big(c\\,\\omega(\\lambda t)\\big) = c \\cdot \\frac{d}{dt}\\omega(\\lambda t)\n    $$\n    Using the chain rule and the fact that $\\partial_s \\omega(s) = -\\rho(\\omega(s))$ where $s = \\lambda t$:\n    $$\n    \\text{LHS} = c \\cdot (\\partial_s\\omega)|_{s=\\lambda t} \\cdot \\frac{d(\\lambda t)}{dt} = c \\cdot \\big(-\\rho(\\omega(\\lambda t))\\big) \\cdot \\lambda = -c\\lambda\\,\\rho\\big(\\omega(\\lambda t)\\big)\n    $$\n    The right-hand side (RHS) of the flow equation is:\n    $$\n    \\text{RHS} = -\\rho\\big(\\omega^{(c)}(t)\\big) = -\\rho\\big(c\\,\\omega(\\lambda t)\\big)\n    $$\n    Using the result from part 2, namely that the Ricci form is invariant under scaling of its argument Kähler form ($\\rho(c\\eta) = \\rho(\\eta)$), we get:\n    $$\n    \\text{RHS} = -\\rho\\big(\\omega(\\lambda t)\\big)\n    $$\n    Equating the LHS and RHS:\n    $$\n    -c\\lambda\\,\\rho\\big(\\omega(\\lambda t)\\big) = -\\rho\\big(\\omega(\\lambda t)\\big)\n    $$\n    Assuming that $\\rho(\\omega(\\lambda t))$ is not identically zero, we can divide both sides by it, which gives:\n    $$\n    c\\lambda = 1 \\implies \\lambda = \\frac{1}{c}\n    $$\n    Thus, the time reparametrization is $f(t) = t/c$. The solution with the rescaled initial condition is:\n    $$\n    \\omega^{(c)}(t) = c\\,\\omega\\left(\\frac{t}{c}\\right)\n    $$\n    This expression relates the solution of the flow for the initial metric $c\\,g(0)$ to the solution for the initial metric $g(0)$ via a scaling of the form and a reparametrization of time.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{c\\,\\omega\\left(\\frac{t}{c}\\right)}$$", "id": "3070725"}]}
