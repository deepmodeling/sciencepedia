It is a well-posed mathematical question grounded in the standard definitions of optimal transport theory, which forms the basis for the Lott-Sturm-Villani synthetic theory of Ricci curvature. All definitions are standard and the problem is self-contained. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nOur objective is to compute the $2$-Wasserstein distance, $W_{2}(\\delta_{x}, \\delta_{y})$, between two Dirac measures $\\delta_{x}$ and $\\delta_{y}$ on a complete separable metric space $(X, d)$, for given points $x, y \\in X$.\n\nThe squared $2$-Wasserstein distance is defined as:\n$$\nW_{2}(\\mu,\\nu)^{2} = \\inf_{\\pi \\in \\Pi(\\mu,\\nu)} \\int_{X \\times X} d(u,v)^{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\pi(u,v)\n$$\nIn our specific case, the measures are $\\mu = \\delta_x$ and $\\nu = \\delta_y$. Thus, we have:\n$$\nW_{2}(\\delta_{x},\\delta_{y})^{2} = \\inf_{\\pi \\in \\Pi(\\delta_{x},\\delta_{y})} \\int_{X \\times X} d(u,v)^{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\pi(u,v)\n$$\nThe crucial step is to characterize the set of couplings $\\Pi(\\delta_{x},\\delta_{y})$. A coupling $\\pi$ is a Borel probability measure on the product space $X \\times X$ whose marginals are $\\delta_x$ and $\\delta_y$. Let us analyze this condition rigorously.\n\nThe first marginal of $\\pi$ must be $\\delta_x$. This means that for any Borel set $A \\subseteq X$, the following must hold:\n$$\n\\pi(A \\times X) = (\\operatorname{proj}_{1})_{\\#}\\pi(A) = \\delta_{x}(A)\n$$\nwhere $(\\operatorname{proj}_{1})_{\\#}\\pi$ is the pushforward of $\\pi$ by the projection onto the first coordinate. The measure $\\delta_x(A)$ is $1$ if $x \\in A$ and $0$ if $x \\notin A$.\nLet's choose $A = \\{x\\}$. Then $\\delta_x(\\{x\\}) = 1$. The condition implies:\n$$\n\\pi(\\{x\\} \\times X) = 1\n$$\nThis signifies that the entire mass of the probability measure $\\pi$ must be concentrated on the subset $\\{x\\} \\times X \\subset X \\times X$.\n\nSimilarly, the second marginal of $\\pi$ must be $\\delta_y$. This means that for any Borel set $B \\subseteq X$:\n$$\n\\pi(X \\times B) = (\\operatorname{proj}_{2})_{\\#}\\pi(B) = \\delta_{y}(B)\n$$\nwhere $(\\operatorname{proj}_{2})_{\\#}\\pi$ is the pushforward of $\\pi$ by the projection onto the second coordinate. The measure $\\delta_y(B)$ is $1$ if $y \\in B$ and $0$ if $y \\notin B$.\nLet's choose $B = \\{y\\}$. Then $\\delta_y(\\{y\\}) = 1$. The condition implies:\n$$\n\\pi(X \\times \\{y\\}) = 1\n$$\nThis signifies that the entire mass of the probability measure $\\pi$ must also be concentrated on the subset $X \\times \\{y\\} \\subset X \\times X$.\n\nFor $\\pi$ to be a valid coupling, it must satisfy both marginal conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the support of $\\pi$ must be contained in the intersection of the two sets $\\{x\\} \\times X$ and $X \\times \\{y\\}$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{supp}(\\pi) \\subseteq (\\{x\\} \\times X) \\cap (X \\times \\{y\\}) = \\{(x,y)\\}\n$$\nSince $\\pi$ is a probability measure, its total mass must be $1$. The only probability measure whose support is the single point set $\\{(x,y)\\}$ is the Dirac measure at that point, denoted $\\delta_{(x,y)}$.\nTherefore, the set of admissible couplings $\\Pi(\\delta_x, \\delta_y)$ contains exactly one element:\n$$\n\\Pi(\\delta_{x},\\delta_{y}) = \\{\\delta_{(x,y)}\\}\n$$\nThis result provides a clear interpretation: the only way to transport the entire mass from point $x$ to point $y$ is to move the mass concentrated at $x$ directly to the point $y$. There are no other transport plans.\n\nWith the set of couplings being a singleton, the infimum in the definition of $W_2^2$ is trivial. We only need to evaluate the integral for the unique coupling $\\pi = \\delta_{(x,y)}$:\n$$\nW_{2}(\\delta_{x},\\delta_{y})^{2} = \\int_{X \\times X} d(u,v)^{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\delta_{(x,y)}(u,v)\n$$\nThe integral of a function $f(u,v)$ with respect to a Dirac measure $\\delta_{(a,b)}$ is simply the value of the function at the point $(a,b)$, i.e., $f(a,b)$. In our case, the function is $d(u,v)^2$ and the point is $(x,y)$. The integral thus evaluates to:\n$$\n\\int_{X \\times X} d(u,v)^{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\delta_{(x,y)}(u,v) = d(x,y)^{2}\n$$\nSo, we have found that:\n$$\nW_{2}(\\delta_{x},\\delta_{y})^{2} = d(x,y)^{2}\n$$\nTo find the $2$-Wasserstein distance, we take the square root of both sides:\n$$\nW_{2}(\\delta_{x},\\delta_{y}) = \\sqrt{d(x,y)^{2}} = |d(x,y)|\n$$\nBy definition, a metric $d$ is a non-negative function, so $d(x,y) \\ge 0$. Therefore, $|d(x,y)| = d(x,y)$.\nThe final result is:\n$$\nW_{2}(\\delta_{x},\\delta_{y}) = d(x,y)\n$$\nThis derivation shows from first principles that the Wasserstein distance between two Dirac masses is simply the underlying metric distance between the points supporting those masses. This demonstrates that the metric space $(X,d)$ isometrically embeds into the space of probability measures $(\\mathfrak{P}_2(X), W_2)$ via the map $x \\mapsto \\delta_x$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{d(x,y)}\n$$", "id": "3064719"}, {"introduction": "One of the most powerful ideas in geometry is that curvature governs the growth of volume.

Their Lebesgue measures are $m(A) = \\beta - \\alpha$ and $m(B) = \\delta - \\gamma$.

The only compact and connected non-empty subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$ are closed intervals. Therefore, $S_t$ is a closed interval.\n\nTo determine this interval, we need to find its minimum and maximum elements.
