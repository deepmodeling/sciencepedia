We will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe total space of differential forms on the circle $S^1$ is $\\Omega(S^1) = \\Omega^0(S^1) \\oplus \\Omega^1(S^1)$, as forms of degree $2$ or higher vanish on a $1$-dimensional manifold. The space $\\Omega^{\\text{even}}(S^1)$ is the space of $0$-forms (smooth functions), and $\\Omega^{\\text{odd}}(S^1)$ is the space of $1$-forms.\n\nThe de Rham operator is $D = d + d^*$. Let's analyze its action on the graded space. For an element $\\psi = f + \\omega$ with $f \\in \\Omega^0(S^1)$ and $\\omega \\in \\Omega^1(S^1)$:\n$D(\\psi) = (d+d^*)(f+\\omega) = df + d\\omega + d^*f + d^*\\omega$.\n- $d: \\Omega^k \\to \\Omega^{k+1}$, so $df \\in \\Omega^1(S^1)$ and $d\\omega = 0$.\n- $d^*: \\Omega^k \\to \\Omega^{k-1}$, so $d^*f = 0$ and $d^*\\omega \\in \\Omega^0(S^1)$.\nThus, $D(\\psi) = d^*\\omega + df$. The operator $D$ maps the even part $f$ to the odd part $df$, and the odd part $\\omega$ to the even part $d^*\\omega$.\n\nBy definition, $D^+$ is the part of $D$ that maps $\\Omega^{\\text{even}}(S^1) \\to \\Omega^{\\text{odd}}(S^1)$. Based on the above, this is the exterior derivative $d$ acting on $0$-forms.\n$$D^+ = d: \\Omega^0(S^1) \\to \\Omega^1(S^1)$$\nThe adjoint operator $(D^+)^*$ maps $\\Omega^{\\text{odd}}(S^1) \\to \\Omega^{\\text{even}}(S^1)$. For any $f \\in \\Omega^0(S^1)$ and $\\omega \\in \\Omega^1(S^1)$, the definition of the adjoint is given by the $L^2$ inner product:\n$$\\langle D^+f, \\omega \\rangle = \\langle df, \\omega \\rangle = \\langle f, d^*\\omega \\rangle$$\nThis implies that $(D^+)^*\\omega = d^*\\omega$. So, the adjoint operator is the codifferential $d^*$ acting on $1$-forms.\n$$(D^+)^* = d^*: \\Omega^1(S^1) \\to \\Omega^0(S^1)$$\n\nThe index of $D^+$ is given by $\\operatorname{ind}(D^+) = \\dim \\ker(D^+) - \\dim \\ker((D^+)^*)$.\n\n**1. Compute $\\dim \\ker(D^+)$**\n\nThe kernel of $D^+ = d: \\Omega^0(S^1) \\to \\Omega^1(S^1)$ consists of all functions $f \\in C^\\infty(S^1)$ such that $df = 0$. On a connected manifold, a function has zero exterior derivative if and only if it is a constant function. Since $S^1$ is connected, $\\ker(D^+)$ is the space of constant functions on $S^1$. This space is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ and has dimension $1$.\n$$\\dim \\ker(D^+) = 1$$\nThis dimension is also the zeroth Betti number $b_0(S^1)$.\n\n**2. Compute $\\dim \\ker((D^+)^*)$**\n\nThe kernel of $(D^+)^* = d^*: \\Omega^1(S^1) \\to \\Omega^0(S^1)$ consists of all $1$-forms $\\omega$ such that $d^*\\omega = 0$. We can compute this explicitly. Let $\\theta$ be the angular coordinate on $S^1$, so $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. A generic $1$-form can be written as $\\omega = g(\\theta) d\\theta$, where $g(\\theta)$ is a smooth, $2\\pi$-periodic function. The standard metric on $S^1$ is $ds^2 = d\\theta^2$.\n\nThe codifferential $d^*$ on a $k$-form in an $n$-dimensional oriented Riemannian manifold is given by $d^* = (-1)^{n(k+1)+1} \\star d \\star$, where $\\star$ is the Hodge star operator. For $S^1$, we have $n=1$. For a $1$-form, $k=1$. The sign is $(-1)^{1(1+1)+1} = (-1)^3 = -1$. So, on $\\Omega^1(S^1)$, we have $d^* = -\\star d \\star$.\n\nLet's apply this to $\\omega = g(\\theta)d\\theta$:\n- First, apply the Hodge star to $\\omega$: $\\star\\omega = \\star(g(\\theta)d\\theta) = g(\\theta)(\\star d\\theta)$. The Hodge star of the volume form $d\\theta$ is $1$. So, $\\star\\omega = g(\\theta)$.\n- Next, apply the exterior derivative $d$: $d(g(\\theta)) = \\frac{dg}{d\\theta} d\\theta = g'(\\theta) d\\theta$.\n- Finally, apply the Hodge star again: $\\star d(g(\\theta)) = \\star(g'(\\theta) d\\theta) = g'(\\theta)$.\n\nCombining these, we get $d^*\\omega = -g'(\\theta)$. The condition $d^*\\omega=0$ implies $g'(\\theta)=0$, which means $g(\\theta)$ must be a constant, say $c$.\nSo, $\\ker((D^+)^*)$ consists of all $1$-forms of the type $c \\, d\\theta$ where $c$ is a real constant. This is a $1$-dimensional vector space spanned by the form $d\\theta$.\n$$\\dim \\ker((D^+)^*) = 1$$\nThis dimension corresponds to the first Betti number $b_1(S^1)$. By Hodge theory, $\\dim \\ker(d^*|_{\\Omega^k}) = \\dim \\mathcal{H}^k(M) = b_k(M)$. For $k=1$, this gives $b_1(S^1)=1$.\n\n**3. Compute $\\operatorname{ind}(D^+)$**\n\nUsing the dimensions of the kernels, we can compute the index:\n$$\\operatorname{ind}(D^+) = \\dim \\ker(D^+) - \\dim \\ker((D^+)^*) = 1 - 1 = 0$$\n\n**4. Compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi(S^1)$**\n\nThe Euler characteristic of a topological space can be computed from its Betti numbers $b_k$. For a compact, orientable manifold $M$ of dimension $n$, the formula is:\n$$\\chi(M) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k b_k(M)$$\nFor the circle $S^1$, the dimension is $n=1$. The Betti numbers are:\n- $b_0(S^1) = 1$ (since $S^1$ is connected).\n- $b_1(S^1) = 1$ (since $S^1$ has one \"hole\").\n- $b_k(S^1) = 0$ for $k \\ge 2$.\n\nTherefore, the Euler characteristic of $S^1$ is:\n$$\\chi(S^1) = (-1)^0 b_0(S^1) + (-1)^1 b_1(S^1) = 1 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$$\n\n**5. Verification**\n\nWe have computed the analytical index of the operator $D^+$ to be $\\operatorname{ind}(D^+) = 0$. We have also computed the topological invariant, the Euler characteristic, to be $\\chi(S^1) = 0$.\nThe results match: $\\operatorname{ind}(D^+) = 0 = \\chi(S^1)$. This verifies the Atiyah-Singer index theorem for this specific case, as requested.

We proceed by following the three steps outlined in the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Determination of Harmonic Forms on $T^{2}$\n\nA differential form $\\alpha$ is harmonic if it is in the kernel of the Laplace–de Rham operator, $\\Delta \\alpha = (d d^{*} + d^{*} d) \\alpha = 0$. On a compact manifold, this is equivalent to the conditions $d\\alpha = 0$ (closed) and $d^{*}\\alpha=0$ (co-closed). The dimension of the space of harmonic $k$-forms, denoted $\\mathcal{H}^{k}(T^{2})$, is equal to the $k$-th Betti number $b_{k}(T^{2})$ by the Hodge theorem. We will construct explicit representatives for the harmonic forms in each degree. Let $(x, y)$ be coordinates on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, which serve as periodic coordinates on $T^{2}$. The flat metric is $g = dx \\otimes dx + dy \\otimes dy$.\n\n**Harmonic $0$-forms:**\nA $0$-form is a smooth function $f \\in \\Omega^{0}(T^{2}) = C^{\\infty}(T^{2})$. The exterior derivative is $d f = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} dy$. The adjoint $d^{*}$ on $0$-forms is the zero map, so $d^{*}f = 0$. For $f$ to be harmonic, we require $\\Delta f = 0$. The Laplacian on functions for the flat metric is $\\Delta f = -(\\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial y^{2}})$.\nSo, $\\Delta f = 0$ implies that $f$ is a harmonic function in the classical sense. Any harmonic function on a compact manifold without boundary must be a constant. This can be seen by integrating by parts: $0 = \\int_{T^{2}} f (\\Delta f) \\, dV = \\int_{T^{2}} \\langle df, df \\rangle \\, dV = \\int_{T^{2}} |df|^{2} \\, dV$. This implies $|df|=0$, so $df=0$, which means $f$ is a constant function.\nThe space of harmonic $0$-forms is the space of constant functions, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\nTherefore, $\\dim \\mathcal{H}^{0}(T^{2}) = b_{0}(T^{2}) = 1$. A representative basis element is the constant function $f(x, y) = 1$.\n\n**Harmonic $2$-forms:**\nA $2$-form on $T^{2}$ can be written as $\\omega = f(x, y) dx \\wedge dy$ for some smooth function $f$. Since $\\omega$ is a top-degree form, it is automatically closed: $d\\omega=0$. For $\\omega$ to be harmonic, we also need $d^{*}\\omega = 0$.\nThe operator $d^{*}$ on a $k$-form in dimension $n=2$ is given by $d^{*} = (-1)^{n(k-1)+1} \\star d \\star = (-1)^{2(2-1)+1} \\star d \\star = -\\star d \\star$ for $k=2$. The Hodge star operator for the flat metric acts as: $\\star(1) = dx \\wedge dy$ and $\\star(dx \\wedge dy) = 1$.\nApplying this to $\\omega$:\n$\\star \\omega = \\star(f(x, y) dx \\wedge dy) = f(x, y)$.\n$d(\\star \\omega) = d(f) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} dy$.\n$d^{*}\\omega = -\\star(d(\\star \\omega)) = -\\star\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} dy\\right) = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\star(dx) + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\star(dy)\\right)$.\nSince $\\star(dx)=dy$ and $\\star(dy)=-dx$, we get:\n$d^{*}\\omega = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} dy - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} dx\\right) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} dx - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} dy$.\nThe condition $d^{*}\\omega=0$ implies $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 0$. This means $f$ must be a constant function.\nThe space of harmonic $2$-forms consists of forms $c \\cdot dx \\wedge dy$ where $c$ is a real constant. This space is one-dimensional.\nTherefore, $\\dim \\mathcal{H}^{2}(T^{2}) = b_{2}(T^{2}) = 1$. A representative basis element is the volume form $\\omega = dx \\wedge dy$.\n\n**Harmonic $1$-forms:**\nA $1$-form on $T^{2}$ can be written as $\\alpha = A(x, y) dx + B(x, y) dy$. For $\\alpha$ to be harmonic, it must satisfy $d\\alpha=0$ and $d^{*}\\alpha=0$.\nThe condition $d\\alpha=0$ gives:\n$d\\alpha = d(A dx + B dy) = (\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial y}) dx \\wedge dy = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial y}$.\nThe condition $d^{*}\\alpha=0$ gives:\n$d^{*} \\alpha = -\\star d \\star \\alpha$.\n$\\star \\alpha = \\star(A dx + B dy) = A \\star(dx) + B \\star(dy) = A dy - B dx$.\n$d(\\star \\alpha) = d(A dy - B dx) = (\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial y}) dx \\wedge dy$.\n$d^{*} \\alpha = -\\star(d(\\star \\alpha)) = -\\star\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial y}\\right) dx \\wedge dy\\right) = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial y}\\right)$.\nSo, $d^{*}\\alpha=0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial y} = 0$.\nThe functions $A$ and $B$ must satisfy the system:\n$1.$ $\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial x}$\n$2.$ $\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial y}$\nThese are the Cauchy-Riemann equations for the pair $(A, -B)$. Differentiating the first equation with respect to $y$ and the second with respect to $x$ and comparing gives $\\frac{\\partial^2 A}{\\partial y^2} = -\\frac{\\partial^2 A}{\\partial x^2}$, or $\\Delta A = 0$. Similarly, one finds $\\Delta B = 0$. So, $A$ and $B$ must be harmonic functions on $T^{2}$. As established for $0$-forms, this implies that both $A$ and $B$ must be constant functions.\nLet $A = c_{1}$ and $B = c_{2}$ for constants $c_{1}, c_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The form $\\alpha = c_{1} dx + c_{2} dy$ satisfies both $d\\alpha=0$ and $d^{*}\\alpha=0$. The forms $dx$ and $dy$ are globally well-defined on $T^{2}$ and are linearly independent.\nThe space of harmonic $1$-forms is spanned by $\\{dx, dy\\}$.\nTherefore, $\\dim \\mathcal{H}^{1}(T^{2}) = b_{1}(T^{2}) = 2$.\n\nSummary of dimensions:\n- $\\dim \\mathcal{H}^{0}(T^{2}) = b_{0} = 1$\n- $\\dim \\mathcal{H}^{1}(T^{2}) = b_{1} = 2$\n- $\\dim \\mathcal{H}^{2}(T^{2}) = b_{2} = 1$\n\n### Step 2: Computation of $\\operatorname{ind}(D^{+})$\n\nThe index of the operator $D^{+} : \\Omega^{\\text{even}}(T^{2}) \\to \\Omega^{\\text{odd}}(T^{2})$ is defined as $\\operatorname{ind}(D^{+}) = \\dim \\ker(D^{+}) - \\dim \\operatorname{coker}(D^{+})$.\nWe are given that $\\dim \\operatorname{coker}(D^{+}) = \\dim \\ker(D^{-})$. Thus, $\\operatorname{ind}(D^{+}) = \\dim \\ker(D^{+}) - \\dim \\ker(D^{-})$.\nThe problem also states that the kernel of $D$ on a compact manifold is the space of harmonic forms.\nThe domain of $D^{+}$ is the space of even forms $\\Omega^{\\text{even}}(T^{2}) = \\Omega^{0}(T^{2}) \\oplus \\Omega^{2}(T^{2})$. Thus, its kernel is the space of harmonic even forms:\n$\\ker(D^{+}) = \\mathcal{H}^{\\text{even}}(T^{2}) = \\mathcal{H}^{0}(T^{2}) \\oplus \\mathcal{H}^{2}(T^{2})$.\nThe dimension is $\\dim \\ker(D^{+}) = \\dim \\mathcal{H}^{0}(T^{2}) + \\dim \\mathcal{H}^{2}(T^{2})$.\nThe domain of $D^{-}$ is the space of odd forms $\\Omega^{\\text{odd}}(T^{2}) = \\Omega^{1}(T^{2})$. Its kernel is the space of harmonic odd forms:\n$\\ker(D^{-}) = \\mathcal{H}^{\\text{odd}}(T^{2}) = \\mathcal{H}^{1}(T^{2})$.\nThe dimension is $\\dim \\ker(D^{-}) = \\dim \\mathcal{H}^{1}(T^{2})$.\n\nSubstituting these into the index formula:\n$\\operatorname{ind}(D^{+}) = (\\dim \\mathcal{H}^{0}(T^{2}) + \\dim \\mathcal{H}^{2}(T^{2})) - \\dim \\mathcal{H}^{1}(T^{2})$.\nUsing the dimensions computed in Step 1:\n$\\operatorname{ind}(D^{+}) = (1 + 1) - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0$.\n\n### Step 3: Relation to the Euler Characteristic $\\chi(T^{2})$\n\nThe calculation performed is a specific instance of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. For the operator $D^{+} = d+d^{*}$ acting from even to odd forms, the index theorem states that its analytical index is equal to a topological invariant of the manifold, namely its Euler characteristic $\\chi(T^{2})$.\nThe analytical index is:\n$\\operatorname{ind}(D^{+}) = \\dim \\ker(D^{+}) - \\dim \\ker(D^{-}) = \\dim \\mathcal{H}^{\\text{even}}(T^{2}) - \\dim \\mathcal{H}^{\\text{odd}}(T^{2})$\n$\\operatorname{ind}(D^{+}) = (\\dim \\mathcal{H}^{0}(T^{2}) + \\dim \\mathcal{H}^{2}(T^{2})) - \\dim \\mathcal{H}^{1}(T^{2})$.\n\nBy the Hodge theorem, $\\dim \\mathcal{H}^{k}(M) = b_{k}(M)$, the $k$-th Betti number of the manifold $M$. So we have:\n$\\operatorname{ind}(D^{+}) = (b_{0}(T^{2}) + b_{2}(T^{2})) - b_{1}(T^{2}) = b_{0}(T^{2}) - b_{1}(T^{2}) + b_{2}(T^{2})$.\n\nThis alternating sum of Betti numbers is the definition of the Euler characteristic, $\\chi(T^{2})$.\n$\\chi(T^{2}) = \\sum_{k=0}^{2} (-1)^{k} b_{k}(T^{2}) = b_{0}(T^{2}) - b_{1}(T^{2}) + b_{2}(T^{2})$.\nOur computation confirms this general theorem for the specific case of the $2$-torus:\n$\\chi(T^{2}) = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0$.\nThe result $\\operatorname{ind}(D^{+}) = 0$ is therefore the Euler characteristic of the $2$-torus. This is also consistent with the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which for a closed surface $S$ states $\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{S} K dA = \\chi(S)$, where $K$ is the Gaussian curvature. Since $T^{2}$ is equipped with the flat metric, $K=0$ everywhere, so the integral is $0$, confirming that $\\chi(T^{2}) = 0$.\nThe requested final answer is the numerical value of $\\operatorname{ind}(D^{+})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3065508"}, {"introduction": "We now shift focus to complex geometry, where the index theorem appears as the celebrated Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula.

Substituting this into the definition gives:\n$$\n\\operatorname{ch}(\\mathcal{O}_{X}(d)) = \\exp(d h) = 1 + d h + \\frac{(d h)^2}{2} + \\frac{(d h)^3}{6} + \\dots\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the Todd class, $\\operatorname{Td}(T X)$. For a complex vector bundle $E$ of rank $r$ with formal Chern roots $\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_r$, the Todd class is defined as $\\operatorname{Td}(E) = \\prod_{i=1}^r \\frac{\\alpha_i}{1-\\exp(-\\alpha_i)}$.\nSince $X = \\mathbb{C}P^1$ is a complex manifold of dimension $1$, its tangent bundle $T X$ is a complex line bundle (i.e., rank $1$). For a line bundle, there is only one Chern root, which is its first Chern class, $c_1(T X)$. We are given that $c_1(T X) = 2h$. Thus, the Todd class of $T X$ is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Td}(T X) = \\frac{c_1(T X)}{1 - \\exp(-c_1(T X))} = \\frac{2h}{1 - \\exp(-2h)}\n$$\nThe Taylor expansion of the function $f(x) = \\frac{x}{1-e^{-x}}$ around $x=0$ is $1 + \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x^2}{12} + O(x^4)$.\nSubstituting $x=2h$, we obtain the series for the Todd class:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Td}(T X) = 1 + \\frac{2h}{2} + \\frac{(2h)^2}{12} + \\dots = 1 + h + \\frac{1}{3}h^2 + \\dots\n$$\n\nTo compute the product $\\operatorname{ch}(\\mathcal{O}_{X}(d)) \\operatorname{Td}(T X)$, we must consider the structure of the cohomology ring $H^{*}(X; \\mathbb{Q})$. The manifold $X = \\mathbb{C}P^1$ is a real $2$-dimensional sphere $S^2$. Its cohomology is non-trivial only in degree $0$ and $2$, with $H^0(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H^2(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}h$. The cup product structure is determined by the fact that for any class $\\alpha \\in H^p(X)$ and $\\beta \\in H^q(X)$, the product $\\alpha \\smile \\beta$ is in $H^{p+q}(X)$. Since $h \\in H^2(X)$, the product $h^2 = h \\smile h$ is in $H^4(X)$. But $H^4(X)=0$, so we must have $h^2 = 0$. This implies all higher powers $h^k$ for $k \\ge 2$ are also zero.\n\nThis observation dramatically simplifies the series for our characteristic classes, as we only need to consider terms up to degree $2$ (linear in $h$):\n$$\n\\operatorname{ch}(\\mathcal{O}_{X}(d)) = 1 + d h\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{Td}(T X) = 1 + h\n$$\nThe product in the cohomology ring is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{ch}(\\mathcal{O}_{X}(d)) \\operatorname{Td}(T X) = (1 + d h) \\smile (1 + h) = 1 \\smile 1 + 1 \\smile h + d h \\smile 1 + d h \\smile h\n$$\nUsing the properties of the cup product and $h^2=0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\operatorname{ch}(\\mathcal{O}_{X}(d)) \\operatorname{Td}(T X) = 1 + (d+1)h\n$$\nThis expression is a sum of a degree-$0$ class ($1$) and a degree-$2$ class ($(d+1)h$).\n\nThe integral $\\int_X \\omega$ of a cohomology class over the manifold $X$ gives a non-zero value only if the class $\\omega$ has degree equal to the real dimension of $X$, which is $2$. Therefore, we only need to integrate the degree-$2$ component of our resulting class.\n$$\n\\int_X \\left(1 + (d+1)h\\right) = \\int_X (d+1)h\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the integral and the given normalization $\\int_X h = 1$:\n$$\n\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_{X}(d)) = (d+1) \\int_X h = (d+1) \\cdot 1 = d+1\n$$\nThis result should be consistent with the definition $\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_{X}(d)) = \\dim H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_{X}(d)) - \\dim H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_{X}(d))$. For $\\mathbb{C}P^1$, standard results from sheaf cohomology state that $\\dim H^0(\\mathcal{O}(d)) = \\max(0, d+1)$ and $\\dim H^1(\\mathcal{O}(d)) = \\max(0, -d-1)$ by Serre duality.\n- For $d \\ge 0$, $\\chi(\\mathcal{O}(d)) = (d+1) - 0 = d+1$.\n- For $d = -1$, $\\chi(\\mathcal{O}(-1)) = 0 - 0 = 0$; our formula gives $-1+1=0$.\n- For $d \\le -2$, $\\chi(\\mathcal{O}(d)) = 0 - (-d-1) = d+1$.\nThe result $d+1$ is correct for all integers $d$, verifying the calculation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{d+1}$$", "id": "3065481"}]}
