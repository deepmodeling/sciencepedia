It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and all terms are well-defined. The necessary data, including the differential equation, the domain, and the boundary conditions, are provided without ambiguity or contradiction. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem is to find the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ and eigenfunctions $u$ for the Dirichlet problem of the Laplacian on a rectangular domain $\\Omega = [0,a]\\times[0,b]$, where $a0$ and $b0$. The governing equation is:\n$$\n-\\Delta u = \\lambda u \\quad \\text{in } \\Omega\n$$\nwhich can be written in Cartesian coordinates as:\n$$\n-\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\\right) = \\lambda u\n$$\nThe boundary condition is $u=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$, which means $u(x,y)=0$ if $x=0$, $x=a$, $y=0$, or $y=b$.\n\nWe are instructed to use the method of separation of variables. We assume a non-trivial solution of the form $u(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$. Substituting this into the partial differential equation gives:\n$$\n-X''(x)Y(y) - X(x)Y''(y) = \\lambda X(x)Y(y)\n$$\nwhere $X''(x) = \\frac{d^2 X}{dx^2}$ and $Y''(y) = \\frac{d^2 Y}{dy^2}$. Dividing by the non-zero product $X(x)Y(y)$ yields:\n$$\n-\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} - \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = \\lambda\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged as:\n$$\n-\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = \\lambda + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}\n$$\nThe left side of this equation is a function of $x$ only, while the right side is a function of $y$ only. For the equality to hold for all $(x,y) \\in \\Omega$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call $\\mu$. This separation leads to two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n$$\n(1) \\quad -\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = \\mu \\implies X''(x) + \\mu X(x) = 0\n$$\n$$\n(2) \\quad \\lambda + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = \\mu \\implies Y''(y) + (\\lambda - \\mu)Y(y) = 0\n$$\nLet's define a second separation constant $\\nu = \\lambda - \\mu$. Then the eigenvalue of the original problem is $\\lambda = \\mu + \\nu$, and the second ODE becomes $Y''(y) + \\nu Y(y) = 0$.\n\nNext, we apply the boundary conditions.\nThe condition $u(0,y) = X(0)Y(y) = 0$ for all $y \\in [0,b]$ implies $X(0)=0$, since $Y(y)$ cannot be identically zero for a non-trivial solution $u$.\nSimilarly, $u(a,y) = X(a)Y(y) = 0$ implies $X(a)=0$.\nThe condition $u(x,0) = X(x)Y(0) = 0$ for all $x \\in [0,a]$ implies $Y(0)=0$.\nFinally, $u(x,b) = X(x)Y(b) = 0$ implies $Y(b)=0$.\n\nWe now solve the boundary value problem for $X(x)$:\n$$\nX''(x) + \\mu X(x) = 0, \\quad X(0)=0, \\quad X(a)=0\n$$\nThis is a standard Sturm-Liouville problem. A non-trivial solution exists only if the constant $\\mu$ is positive. If $\\mu \\le 0$, the only solution satisfying the boundary conditions is the trivial solution $X(x)=0$. For $\\mu  0$, let $\\mu = k^2$ for some $k0$. The general solution is $X(x) = C_1\\cos(kx) + C_2\\sin(kx)$.\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n$X(0) = C_1\\cos(0) + C_2\\sin(0) = C_1 = 0$.\nThe solution is thus $X(x) = C_2\\sin(kx)$.\n$X(a) = C_2\\sin(ka) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution, we need $C_2 \\neq 0$, so we must have $\\sin(ka)=0$.\nThis condition implies $ka = m\\pi$ for some integer $m$. Since $k0$ and $a0$, $m$ must be a positive integer, $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$.\nThe allowed values for $k$ are $k_m = \\frac{m\\pi}{a}$.\nThe eigenvalues for the $x$-problem are $\\mu_m = k_m^2 = \\left(\\frac{m\\pi}{a}\\right)^2$ for $m=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions are $X_m(x) = C_m\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{a}\\right)$, where $C_m$ is an arbitrary non-zero constant.\n\nThe boundary value problem for $Y(y)$ is analogous:\n$$\nY''(y) + \\nu Y(y) = 0, \\quad Y(0)=0, \\quad Y(b)=0\n$$\nA non-trivial solution requires $\\nu  0$. Let $\\nu = p^2$ for some $p0$. The general solution is $Y(y) = D_1\\cos(py) + D_2\\sin(py)$.\n$Y(0) = D_1 = 0$.\n$Y(b) = D_2\\sin(pb) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution, $\\sin(pb)=0$.\nThis implies $pb = n\\pi$ for some positive integer $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$.\nThe allowed values for $p$ are $p_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{b}$.\nThe eigenvalues for the $y$-problem are $\\nu_n = p_n^2 = \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{b}\\right)^2$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions are $Y_n(y) = D_n\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{b}\\right)$.\n\nCombining these results, the separated eigenfunctions for the Dirichlet Laplacian on the rectangle $\\Omega$ are indexed by the pair of positive integers $(m,n)$:\n$$\nu_{m,n}(x,y) = X_m(x)Y_n(y) = A_{m,n} \\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{b}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $A_{m,n}=C_m D_n$ is a normalization constant. The number of nodal domains is independent of this constant, so we can set $A_{m,n}=1$.\nThe corresponding eigenvalues are:\n$$\n\\lambda_{m,n} = \\mu_m + \\nu_n = \\left(\\frac{m\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{b}\\right)^2 = \\pi^2\\left(\\frac{m^2}{a^2} + \\frac{n^2}{b^2}\\right)\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNow, we must determine the number of nodal domains of the eigenfunction $u_{m,n}(x,y)$. A nodal domain is a connected component of the set $\\{(x,y) \\in \\Omega : u_{m,n}(x,y) \\neq 0\\}$. The boundaries of these domains are formed by the nodal set, which is the set of points where $u_{m,n}(x,y) = 0$.\nThe nodal set is given by the equation:\n$$\n\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{b}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThis equation holds if and only if $\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{a}\\right) = 0$ or $\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{b}\\right) = 0$.\n\nThe first condition, $\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{a}\\right) = 0$, is satisfied when $\\frac{m\\pi x}{a} = k\\pi$ for some integer $k$. This implies $x = \\frac{k a}{m}$.\nSince $x \\in [0, a]$, the possible integer values for $k$ are $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, m\\}$.\nThis gives a set of $m+1$ vertical nodal lines: $x=0, x=\\frac{a}{m}, x=\\frac{2a}{m}, \\ldots, x=a$.\nThe lines $x=0$ and $x=a$ are on the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$. The interior nodal lines are given by $x = \\frac{k a}{m}$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, m-1\\}$. There are $m-1$ such interior vertical lines.\n\nThe second condition, $\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{b}\\right) = 0$, is satisfied when $\\frac{n\\pi y}{b} = j\\pi$ for some integer $j$. This implies $y = \\frac{j b}{n}$.\nSince $y \\in [0, b]$, the possible integer values for $j$ are $j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$.\nThis gives a set of $n+1$ horizontal nodal lines: $y=0, y=\\frac{b}{n}, y=\\frac{2b}{n}, \\ldots, y=b$.\nThe lines $y=0$ and $y=b$ are on the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$. The interior nodal lines are given by $y = \\frac{j b}{n}$ for $j \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$. There are $n-1$ such interior horizontal lines.\n\nThe total nodal set within the open rectangle $(0,a)\\times(0,b)$ is the union of these two sets of interior lines. These lines form a grid that partitions the rectangle $\\Omega$ into smaller, non-overlapping rectangular cells.\nThe $m-1$ interior vertical lines divide the rectangle into $m$ columns.\nThe $n-1$ interior horizontal lines divide the rectangle into $n$ rows.\nThe total number of small rectangular cells created by this grid is the product of the number of columns and the number of rows, which is $m \\times n$.\n\nWithin each of these small open rectangular cells, for example, a cell defined by $\\frac{(k-1)a}{m}  x  \\frac{ka}{m}$ and $\\frac{(j-1)b}{n}  y  \\frac{jb}{n}$ for $k \\in \\{1,\\ldots,m\\}$ and $j \\in \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$, neither $\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{a}\\right)$ nor $\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{b}\\right)$ is zero. Thus, $u_{m,n}(x,y)$ is non-zero throughout each cell. Since each cell is a connected set, and $u_{m,n}(x,y)$ has a constant sign within it (the sign pattern alternates like a checkerboard), each cell constitutes a single nodal domain.\nTherefore, the number of nodal domains is equal to the number of cells in this grid.\n\nThe number of nodal domains of the eigenfunction $u_{m,n}$ is $mn$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{mn}$$", "id": "3057225"}, {"introduction": "The behavior of eigenfunctions is profoundly influenced by the conditions imposed at the boundary of a domain.

Note that the boundary of the square $\\partial S$ (corresponding to $x=0, x=1, y=0, y=1$) is part of this nodal set. This is consistent with the Dirichlet condition, which requires the eigenfunction to vanish on the boundary.\n\nThe interior of the square, $(0,1)^2$, is partitioned by the interior nodal lines:\n- $m-1$ vertical lines: $x = \\frac{k}{m}$ for $k=1, \\ldots, m-1$.\n- $n-1$ horizontal lines: $y = \\frac{l}{n}$ for $l=1, \\ldots, n-1$.\n\nThese lines form a rectangular grid that divides the interior of the square into $m \\times n$ open rectangles of the form\n$$ \\left( \\frac{k-1}{m}, \\frac{k}{m} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{l-1}{n}, \\frac{l}{n} \\right) $$\nfor $k \\in \\{1, \\ldots, m\\}$ and $l \\in \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$.\n\nWithin each of these open rectangles, neither $\\sin(\\pi m x)$ nor $\\sin(\\pi n y)$ is zero.

That happens for $x$ in the interval\n$$\nx \\in \\left[\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\arccos\\!\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{2}\\Bigr),\\;1-\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\arccos\\!\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{2}\\Bigr)\\right] = \\left[\\frac{1}{3},\\;\\frac{2}{3}\\right].\n$$\nFor each such $x$, there is a unique $y\\in(0,1)$ satisfying $\\cos(\\pi y)=-2\\cos(\\pi x)$ because $y\\mapsto \\cos(\\pi y)$ is strictly decreasing from $1$ to $-1$ on $(0,1)$. Thus the interior nodal set is a single smooth curve that runs from near the top boundary at $x=\\frac{1}{3}$ (where $\\cos(\\pi x)=\\frac{1}{2}$ forces $\\cos(\\pi y)=-1$ so $y\\to 1$) down to near the bottom boundary at $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ (where $\\cos(\\pi x)=-\\frac{1}{2}$ forces $\\cos(\\pi y)=1$ so $y\\to 0$). A single interior curve connecting the top boundary to the bottom boundary splits the square into two connected open components (to the left and right of the curve). Therefore,\n$$\nN(2)=2.\n$$\n\nFinally, we determine $t_{\\ast}0$ such that $(x_{\\ast},y_{\\ast})=\\left(\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{2}{3}\\right)$ lies on the interior nodal set of $u_{t}$. This requires\n$$\n\\cos\\!\\Bigl(\\pi\\cdot \\frac{2}{3}\\Bigr) + t_{\\ast} \\cos\\!\\Bigl(\\pi\\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\\Bigr) = 0.\n$$\nCompute the cosines: $\\cos\\!\\bigl(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\bigr)=-\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\cos\\!\\bigl(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\bigr)=\\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting gives\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2} + t_{\\ast}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 0 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad t_{\\ast}=1.\n$$\n\nCollecting the results in the requested order, we have $(N(0),N(1),N(2),t_{\\ast}) = (2,2,2,1)$.\n\nThis analysis demonstrates explicitly how different linear combinations within a degenerate eigenspace produce different interior nodal sets (horizontal line for $t=0$, diagonal line for $t=1$, and a smooth curve connecting top and bottom for $t=2$), while in these cases the nodal domain count remains $2$. The change in nodal geometry is captured by the equation $\\cos(\\pi y) + t \\cos(\\pi x)=0$, and specific geometric features (such as passing through a prescribed interior point) follow by solving for $t$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}2  2  2  1\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3057183"}]}
