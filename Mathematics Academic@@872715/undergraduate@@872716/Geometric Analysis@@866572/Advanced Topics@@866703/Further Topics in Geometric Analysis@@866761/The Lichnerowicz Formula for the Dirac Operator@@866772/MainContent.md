## Introduction
The Lichnerowicz formula is a cornerstone of modern geometric analysis, providing a profound and explicit link between the analytical properties of the Dirac operator and the geometric curvature of the underlying manifold. Its significance lies in transforming abstract [operator theory](@entry_id:139990) into a powerful tool for deducing concrete geometric and topological information. This article addresses the essential question of how, precisely, the curvature of a space dictates the behavior of spinor fields living on it. By deriving and applying this formula, we bridge the apparent gap between local geometry and the global properties of a manifold.

This exploration is structured to guide you from foundational principles to powerful applications. In the first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, we will build the necessary algebraic and geometric machinery, including Clifford algebras and [spinor bundles](@entry_id:181093), to define the Dirac operator and derive the celebrated formula. Following this, the **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** chapter will unveil the formula's far-reaching consequences in [spectral geometry](@entry_id:186460), [index theory](@entry_id:270237), and fundamental physics. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section will allow you to solidify your understanding by working through key computations and examples that illuminate the theory in action.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delves into the technical heart of [spin geometry](@entry_id:181531), culminating in the derivation and interpretation of the Lichnerowicz formula for the Dirac operator. We will begin by constructing the fundamental algebraic and geometric objects: Clifford algebras, spin groups, and [spinor bundles](@entry_id:181093). We will then define the [spin connection](@entry_id:161745) and the Dirac operator, establishing the analytical framework. Finally, we will derive the celebrated Lichnerowicz formula, a cornerstone of geometric analysis, and explore its profound consequences for the interplay between geometry and analysis.

### Geometric and Algebraic Foundations

The theory of spinors is built upon a sophisticated interplay between algebra and geometry. The algebraic foundation is the Clifford algebra, which provides the language for "linearizing" the [quadratic form](@entry_id:153497) defined by a metric. The geometric foundation is the concept of a spin structure, which allows for the global definition of [spinor](@entry_id:154461) fields over a manifold.

#### Clifford Algebras and Spin Groups

The journey into [spin geometry](@entry_id:181531) begins not with geometry, but with pure algebra. Given a real vector space $V$ equipped with a [symmetric bilinear form](@entry_id:148281) $g$, we seek an associative algebra that elegantly encodes the information of $g$. While the familiar **[exterior algebra](@entry_id:201164)**, $\Lambda V$, is constructed from the [tensor algebra](@entry_id:161671) $T(V)$ by imposing the relation $v \otimes v = 0$ for all $v \in V$, which by polarization leads to the anticommutative law $v \wedge w = -w \wedge v$, the **Clifford algebra** takes a different path.

The **Clifford algebra** $\mathrm{Cl}(V, g)$ is defined as the quotient of the [tensor algebra](@entry_id:161671) $T(V)$ by the [two-sided ideal](@entry_id:272452) generated by elements of the form $v \otimes v + g(v,v) \cdot 1$ for all $v \in V$. In this context, $v$ is a vector in $V$ and $1$ is the multiplicative identity in the algebra. This definition directly imposes the fundamental Clifford relation on the product (denoted by juxtaposition):
$v^2 = -g(v,v) \cdot 1$.

Just as with the [exterior algebra](@entry_id:201164), this quadratic relation can be "polarized" to yield a bilinear one. For any two vectors $v, w \in V$, we consider $(v+w)^2$:
$(v+w)^2 = -g(v+w, v+w) \cdot 1 = -(g(v,v) + 2g(v,w) + g(w,w)) \cdot 1$.
Expanding the left side gives $v^2 + vw + wv + w^2$. Equating the two expressions and substituting $v^2 = -g(v,v) \cdot 1$ and $w^2 = -g(w,w) \cdot 1$ yields the polarized Clifford relation:
$vw + wv = -2g(v,w) \cdot 1$.

This single relation beautifully captures the distinction from the [exterior algebra](@entry_id:201164). The symmetric part of the Clifford product, $vw + wv$, is determined by the metric $g$, whereas the corresponding expression in the [exterior algebra](@entry_id:201164), $v \wedge w + w \wedge v$, is identically zero [@problem_id:3072049]. For a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$, this construction is applied pointwise to each tangent space $T_xM$ with its inner product $g_x$.

Within the Clifford algebra $\mathrm{Cl}(\mathbb{R}^n, g_{\text{Eucl}})$, where $g_{\text{Eucl}}$ is the standard Euclidean metric, one can define the **[spin group](@entry_id:189920)**, $\mathrm{Spin}(n)$. It is a specific subgroup of the invertible elements of the Clifford algebra. For $n \ge 2$, the [spin group](@entry_id:189920) $\mathrm{Spin}(n)$ is a Lie group that serves as a [double cover](@entry_id:183816) of the [special orthogonal group](@entry_id:146418) $\mathrm{SO}(n)$. There is a canonical Lie [group homomorphism](@entry_id:140603) $\lambda: \mathrm{Spin}(n) \to \mathrm{SO}(n)$ which is two-to-one. For $n \ge 3$, this map is in fact the universal covering map, as $\mathrm{Spin}(n)$ is simply connected while $\pi_1(\mathrm{SO}(n)) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$ [@problem_id:3072060].

#### Spin Structures and Spinor Bundles

With the algebraic prerequisites in place, we can turn to the geometry. An oriented $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ comes equipped with a principal $\mathrm{SO}(n)$-bundle, the **oriented [orthonormal frame](@entry_id:189702) bundle** $P_{\mathrm{SO}(n)} \to M$. The fiber over a point $x \in M$ consists of all oriented [orthonormal bases](@entry_id:753010) of the tangent space $T_xM$.

A **[spin structure](@entry_id:157768)** on $(M,g)$ is a "lift" of this bundle to the [spin group](@entry_id:189920). More precisely, it is a pair $(P_{\mathrm{Spin}(n)}, \Theta)$ consisting of a principal $\mathrm{Spin}(n)$-bundle $P_{\mathrm{Spin}(n)} \to M$ and a smooth bundle map $\Theta: P_{\mathrm{Spin}(n)} \to P_{\mathrm{SO}(n)}$ that covers the identity map on $M$ and is equivariant with respect to the covering homomorphism $\lambda$. This [equivariance](@entry_id:636671) is crucial and takes the form:
$\Theta(u \cdot h) = \Theta(u) \cdot \lambda(h)$ for all $u \in P_{\mathrm{Spin}(n)}$ and $h \in \mathrm{Spin}(n)$.
This condition ensures that the map $\Theta$ respects the [principal bundle](@entry_id:159429) structures, intertwining the $\mathrm{Spin}(n)$ action on the source with the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ action on the target via $\lambda$. Since $\lambda$ is a $2:1$ map, the bundle map $\Theta$ is also $2:1$ on each fiber [@problem_id:3072060].

Not every oriented Riemannian manifold admits a [spin structure](@entry_id:157768). The existence of such a lift is obstructed by a topological condition. A spin structure exists if and only if the second **Stiefel-Whitney class** of the tangent bundle, $w_2(TM) \in H^2(M; \mathbb{Z}_2)$, vanishes [@problem_id:3072060]. Manifolds satisfying this condition are called **[spin manifolds](@entry_id:200931)**.

Once a spin structure $P_{\mathrm{Spin}(n)}$ is given, we can construct the **[spinor bundle](@entry_id:635590)** $\mathbb{S} \to M$. This is achieved through the standard associated bundle construction. The Clifford algebra $\mathrm{Cl}_n^{\mathbb{C}} = \mathrm{Cl}(\mathbb{R}^n, g_{\text{Eucl}}) \otimes \mathbb{C}$ has a unique (up to [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127)) irreducible [complex representation](@entry_id:183096) space, denoted $\Delta_n$. The [spin group](@entry_id:189920) $\mathrm{Spin}(n)$ acts on this space, yielding the **complex spin representation** $\rho: \mathrm{Spin}(n) \to \mathrm{GL}(\Delta_n)$. The [spinor bundle](@entry_id:635590) is then defined as the associated vector bundle:
$\mathbb{S} = P_{\mathrm{Spin}(n)} \times_{\rho} \Delta_n$.

The fiber $\mathbb{S}_x$ of the [spinor bundle](@entry_id:635590) over a point $x \in M$ is isomorphic to the representation space $\Delta_n$. The complex dimension of this space is $2^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}$. For even dimensions $n=2k$, the representation $\Delta_{2k}$ is reducible into two irreducible subrepresentations, $\Delta_{2k}^+ \oplus \Delta_{2k}^-$, each of dimension $2^{k-1}$. This splitting is induced by the action of the **chirality element** (or complex volume element). This algebraic splitting carries over to the geometry, decomposing the [spinor bundle](@entry_id:635590) into two **chiral [spinor bundles](@entry_id:181093)** (or Weyl [spinor bundles](@entry_id:181093)), $\mathbb{S} = \mathbb{S}^+ \oplus \mathbb{S}^-$. Sections of these bundles are called chiral or Weyl [spinors](@entry_id:158054) [@problem_id:3072051].

### The Dirac Operator and its Connection

With the [spinor bundle](@entry_id:635590) constructed, we can now define differential operators that act on its sections, known as [spinor](@entry_id:154461) fields. The most important of these is the Dirac operator, which requires a compatible notion of differentiation: the [spin connection](@entry_id:161745).

#### The Spin Connection

A connection on a [vector bundle](@entry_id:157593) allows for the differentiation of its sections. On a Riemannian manifold, the tangent bundle has a canonical connection, the **Levi-Civita connection** $\nabla^{g}$, which is both [metric-compatible](@entry_id:160255) and torsion-free. This connection can be viewed as a $\mathfrak{so}(n)$-valued 1-form $\omega$ on the [orthonormal frame](@entry_id:189702) bundle $P_{\mathrm{SO}(n)}$.

A key consequence of a spin structure is that this connection can be uniquely lifted to the spin [frame bundle](@entry_id:187852). The Lie algebra isomorphism $d\lambda_e: \mathfrak{spin}(n) \to \mathfrak{so}(n)$ allows us to pull back the $\mathfrak{so}(n)$-valued form $\omega$ via the map $\Theta$ to a $\mathfrak{spin}(n)$-valued [connection 1-form](@entry_id:181132) $\tilde{\omega}$ on $P_{\mathrm{Spin}(n)}$ [@problem_id:3072060]. This lifted connection is called the **spin connection**.

The spin connection on $P_{\mathrm{Spin}(n)}$ in turn induces a [covariant derivative](@entry_id:152476), denoted $\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}$, on the associated [spinor bundle](@entry_id:635590) $\mathbb{S}$. To understand its structure, we can write its local expression. Let $\{e_i\}$ be a local oriented [orthonormal frame](@entry_id:189702) on an open set $U \subset M$. The Levi-Civita connection is described by [connection 1-forms](@entry_id:185893) $\omega_{ij}$ via $\nabla^{g}_X e_i = \sum_j \omega_{ij}(X) e_j$. The local expression for the spin connection acting on a spinor field $\psi$ is then given by:
$\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_X \psi = X(\psi) - \frac{1}{4} \sum_{i,j=1}^n \omega_{ij}(X) c(e_i)c(e_j) \psi$.

Here, $X(\psi)$ represents the differentiation of the components of $\psi$ in the [local trivialization](@entry_id:267993), and $c(e_i)$ denotes Clifford multiplication. This formula reveals the structure of the [spin connection](@entry_id:161745): it is the "flat" derivative corrected by a term involving the geometry (via $\omega_{ij}$) and the algebraic structure of [spinors](@entry_id:158054) (via the Clifford product $c(e_i)c(e_j)$) [@problem_id:2995205]. This connection is compatible with both the metric and Clifford multiplication, in the sense that $\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_X(c(Y)\psi) = c(\nabla^{g}_X Y)\psi + c(Y)\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_X \psi$.

#### The Dirac Operator

The **Dirac operator** $D$ is a first-order differential operator acting on [spinor](@entry_id:154461) fields, constructed as the composition of the spin connection with Clifford multiplication. It is defined as
$D = c \circ \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}$.
More explicitly, in any local [orthonormal frame](@entry_id:189702) $\{e_i\}$, its action on a spinor field $\psi$ is given by the trace of the covariant derivative:
$D\psi = \sum_{i=1}^n c(e_i) \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i} \psi$.

This operator is remarkable for being a natural, geometric "square root" of a Laplacian-type operator. On a closed manifold, $D$ is an elliptic, formally [self-adjoint operator](@entry_id:149601), properties which grant it a discrete real spectrum and make it a central object of study in [index theory](@entry_id:270237) and geometric analysis [@problem_id:2995171].

### The Lichnerowicz Formula

One of the most powerful tools for studying the Dirac operator is the Lichnerowicz formula, a Bochner-type identity that relates the square of the Dirac operator, $D^2$, to the geometry of the underlying manifold, specifically its [scalar curvature](@entry_id:157547).

#### The Bochner-Weitzenböck Philosophy

The Lichnerowicz formula is a prime example of a general principle in geometry known as the **Bohner-Weitzenböck philosophy**. This philosophy asserts that for many "natural" second-order [elliptic operators](@entry_id:181616) arising in geometry (such as the Laplace-Beltrami operator on [differential forms](@entry_id:146747) or the square of the Dirac operator on [spinors](@entry_id:158054)), the operator can be decomposed into two parts:
1.  A "rough" or **connection Laplacian**, often denoted $\nabla^*\nabla$, which is constructed from the covariant derivative and its formal adjoint. This part depends only on the first derivatives of the metric.
2.  A zeroth-order **curvature term**, which is an endomorphism of the bundle that depends algebraically on the [curvature tensor](@entry_id:181383) of the connection.

Such formulas are incredibly powerful because they separate the differential (kinetic) part of the operator from the algebraic (potential) part, allowing for a deep analysis of the operator's spectrum and kernel in terms of the manifold's curvature [@problem_id:3072042].

#### Derivation of the Formula

We now derive the Lichnerowicz formula by computing $D^2$ and isolating the curvature term. Let $\psi$ be a smooth spinor field. We perform the calculation at an arbitrary point $p \in M$ and choose a local oriented [orthonormal frame](@entry_id:189702) $\{e_i\}$ that is geodesic at $p$. This means $\nabla^{g}_{e_i} e_j|_p = 0$.

By definition, $D^2\psi = D(D\psi) = \sum_{j} c(e_j) \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_j} (\sum_{i} c(e_i) \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i} \psi)$. Applying the product rule for $\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}$:
$D^2\psi = \sum_{i,j} c(e_j) \left( (\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_j} c(e_i)) \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i}\psi + c(e_i) \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_j} \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i}\psi \right)$.

At the point $p$, the compatibility of the [spin connection](@entry_id:161745) implies $(\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_j} c(e_i))\psi|_p = c(\nabla^{g}_{e_j} e_i)\psi|_p = c(0) = 0$. The expression simplifies significantly:
$D^2\psi|_p = \sum_{i,j} c(e_j)c(e_i) \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_j} \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i} \psi$.

We decompose the sum by separating the product of Clifford matrices into its symmetric and antisymmetric parts. Using $c(e_j)c(e_i) = \frac{1}{2}(c(e_j)c(e_i) + c(e_i)c(e_j)) + \frac{1}{2}(c(e_j)c(e_i) - c(e_i)c(e_j)) = -\delta_{ji} + \frac{1}{2}[c(e_j), c(e_i)]$:
$D^2\psi|_p = \sum_{i,j} (-\delta_{ji} + \frac{1}{2}[c(e_j), c(e_i)]) \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_j} \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i} \psi$.

The first part gives $-\sum_i \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i} \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i} \psi$. In a geodesic frame, this is exactly the action of the **connection Laplacian**, $\nabla^{\mathbb{S}*}\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}$, on $\psi$.

The second part is the curvature term: $\mathcal{R}\psi = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j} [c(e_j), c(e_i)] \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_j} \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i} \psi$. Due to the antisymmetry of the commutator $[c(e_j), c(e_i)]$, only the antisymmetric part of the second derivatives contributes. This part is precisely the curvature of the spin connection, $R^{\mathbb{S}}(e_j, e_i) = [\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_j}, \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i}]$ (since $[e_j, e_i]|_p = 0$). The term becomes:
$\mathcal{R}\psi = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{i,j} [c(e_j), c(e_i)] R^{\mathbb{S}}(e_j, e_i) \psi$.

The curvature of the [spin connection](@entry_id:161745) is related to the Riemann [curvature tensor](@entry_id:181383) $R^g$ of the manifold by:
$R^{\mathbb{S}}(X,Y) = \frac{1}{4}\sum_{a,b} \langle R^g(X,Y)e_a, e_b \rangle_g c(e_a)c(e_b)$.

Substituting this into the expression for $\mathcal{R}$ yields a complicated sum involving four Clifford multiplications contracted with the Riemann tensor. A remarkable algebraic identity, stemming from the symmetries of the Riemann tensor and the structure of the Clifford algebra, shows that this entire expression simplifies dramatically. The contraction reduces to a scalar multiple of the identity endomorphism [@problem_id:3072028]. Specifically, one finds that this complicated endomorphism is nothing more than multiplication by $\frac{1}{4}$ of the [scalar curvature](@entry_id:157547) [@problem_id:3072055].

Combining the pieces, we arrive at the celebrated **Lichnerowicz formula**:
$D^2 = \nabla^{\mathbb{S}*}\nabla^{\mathbb{S}} + \frac{1}{4}R \cdot \mathrm{Id}_{\mathbb{S}}$.
Here, $R$ is the [scalar curvature](@entry_id:157547) of the manifold. This equation is a profound link between the analysis of the Dirac operator and the global geometry of the manifold.

#### A Note on Conventions

It is essential to be aware that the sign of the curvature term in the Lichnerowicz formula depends on the sign conventions used for the curvature tensor. The formula above holds for the convention $R(X,Y)Z = \nabla_X\nabla_Y Z - \nabla_Y\nabla_X Z - \nabla_{[X,Y]}Z$ and the associated definition of the Ricci and scalar curvatures, which gives the standard round sphere $S^n$ a positive scalar curvature $R=n(n-1)$. If one were to use the opposite convention, $R' = -R$, then the [scalar curvature](@entry_id:157547) would also flip sign, $R' = -R$. Since the derivation of the formula is linear in the [curvature tensor](@entry_id:181383), the curvature term would become $+\frac{1}{4}R' = -\frac{1}{4}R$. Thus, switching the curvature convention flips the sign of the curvature term in the Lichnerowicz formula [@problem_id:3072038]. Throughout this text, we adhere to the convention where the standard sphere has [positive scalar curvature](@entry_id:203664).

### Applications and Interpretations

The Lichnerowicz formula is not merely an elegant identity; it is a powerful computational tool with deep applications.

#### Spectral Consequences and Vanishing Theorems

The formula $D^2 = \nabla^{\mathbb{S}*}\nabla^{\mathbb{S}} + \frac{1}{4}R$ can be interpreted as a Schrödinger-type equation. The connection Laplacian $\nabla^{\mathbb{S}*}\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}$ plays the role of the kinetic energy term, while the scalar curvature term $\frac{1}{4}R$ acts as a potential energy [@problem_id:3072031].

Let us explore the consequences of this analogy. The connection Laplacian is a non-negative operator; for any [spinor](@entry_id:154461) field $\psi$ on a closed manifold, [integration by parts](@entry_id:136350) gives $\langle \nabla^{\mathbb{S}*}\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}\psi, \psi \rangle_{L^2} = \langle \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}\psi, \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}\psi \rangle_{L^2} = \|\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}\psi\|^2_{L^2} \ge 0$.
Now, consider the expectation value of $D^2$:
$\langle D^2\psi, \psi \rangle_{L^2} = \|\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}\psi\|^2_{L^2} + \frac{1}{4} \int_M R(x) |\psi(x)|^2 dV_g$.

This immediately leads to a powerful result. If the manifold has a strictly [positive scalar curvature](@entry_id:203664), i.e., $R \ge \rho > 0$ for some constant $\rho$, then for any non-zero spinor $\psi$:
$\langle D^2\psi, \psi \rangle_{L^2} \ge \frac{1}{4} \int_M \rho |\psi(x)|^2 dV_g = \frac{\rho}{4} \|\psi\|^2_{L^2}$.
This implies that any eigenvalue $\lambda$ of $D^2$ must satisfy $\lambda \ge \rho/4 > 0$. In particular, $D^2$ cannot have a zero eigenvalue. A [spinor](@entry_id:154461) $\psi$ with eigenvalue 0 for $D^2$ would also satisfy $D\psi=0$ (since $D$ is self-adjoint). Such a [spinor](@entry_id:154461) is called a **harmonic spinor**. The Lichnerowicz formula thus proves a famous [vanishing theorem](@entry_id:636963): a closed [spin manifold](@entry_id:159034) with [positive scalar curvature](@entry_id:203664) cannot have any non-zero harmonic [spinors](@entry_id:158054). This is a classic example of how curvature can obstruct the existence of solutions to geometric differential equations [@problem_id:3072031].

If the scalar curvature is a constant, $R \equiv R_0$, the formula shows that the spectrum of $D^2$ is simply the spectrum of $\nabla^{\mathbb{S}*}\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}$ shifted by the constant $\frac{R_0}{4}$ [@problem_id:3072031].

#### The Killing Spinor Equation

The Lichnerowicz formula is also a potent tool for studying manifolds that admit special geometric structures. A prime example is a manifold admitting a **Killing [spinor](@entry_id:154461)**, which is a non-zero spinor field $\psi$ satisfying the equation $\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_X \psi = \mu c(X)\psi$ for all vector fields $X$ and some real constant $\mu$.

Let's analyze such a manifold using the Lichnerowicz formula. First, we apply the Dirac operator to the Killing spinor $\psi$:
$D\psi = \sum_i c(e_i) \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i}\psi = \sum_i c(e_i)(\mu c(e_i)\psi) = \mu \sum_i c(e_i)^2 \psi = \mu \sum_i (-1)\psi = -n\mu\psi$.
This shows that a Killing spinor is necessarily an eigenspinor of the Dirac operator. Applying $D$ again, we get $D^2\psi = D(-n\mu\psi) = -n\mu(D\psi) = -n\mu(-n\mu\psi) = n^2\mu^2\psi$.

Now, we compute $D^2\psi$ using the Lichnerowicz formula. We need to evaluate the connection Laplacian term, $\nabla^{\mathbb{S}*}\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}\psi = -\sum_i (\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i}\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i}\psi - \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{\nabla_{e_i}e_i}\psi)$. Working in a geodesic frame at a point, this is $-\sum_i \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i}\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i}\psi$.
$\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i}(\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i}\psi) = \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i}(\mu c(e_i)\psi) = \mu \nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i}(c(e_i)\psi)$.
In our geodesic frame where $\nabla^g_{e_i}e_i=0$ at the point, the product rule for the [covariant derivative](@entry_id:152476) gives $\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i}(c(e_i)\psi) = c(e_i)\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i}\psi$. Thus, the expression becomes $\mu c(e_i)\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}_{e_i}\psi = \mu c(e_i)(\mu c(e_i)\psi) = \mu^2 c(e_i)^2 \psi = -\mu^2\psi$.
Summing over $i$, we find $\nabla^{\mathbb{S}*}\nabla^{\mathbb{S}}\psi = - \sum_i (-\mu^2\psi) = n\mu^2\psi$.

Plugging this into the Lichnerowicz formula gives:
$D^2\psi = (n\mu^2 + \frac{1}{4}R)\psi$.

By equating our two expressions for $D^2\psi$, we arrive at a remarkable conclusion:
$n^2\mu^2\psi = (n\mu^2 + \frac{1}{4}R)\psi$.
Since $\psi$ is non-zero, we can conclude:
$R = 4(n^2\mu^2 - n\mu^2) = 4n(n-1)\mu^2$.

This result demonstrates that any manifold admitting a real Killing [spinor](@entry_id:154461) must have constant positive scalar curvature. In fact, it must be an Einstein manifold. This provides a striking illustration of how the Lichnerowicz formula connects the existence of solutions to a local differential equation (the Killing spinor equation) to a powerful global constraint on the manifold's curvature [@problem_id:2995171].
