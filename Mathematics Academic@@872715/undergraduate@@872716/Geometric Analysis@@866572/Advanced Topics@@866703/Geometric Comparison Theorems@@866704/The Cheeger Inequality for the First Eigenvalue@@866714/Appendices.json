The problem is a classical example illustrating Cheeger's inequality.\n-   **Well-Posed:** All terms are defined formally. The problem asks for specific, computable quantities for a given manifold. A unique solution exists.\n-   **Objective:** The language is precise and devoid of subjective claims.\n\nThe problem is valid. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 3: Derivations\n\n**1. Calculation of the First Nonzero Eigenvalue $\\lambda_{1}(M_{L})$**\n\nThe manifold $M_{L}$ is the quotient of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ by the lattice generated by $(L,0)$ and $(0,1)$. We can represent functions on $M_{L}$ as functions on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ that are periodic with respect to this lattice, i.e., $f(x+L, y) = f(x, y)$ and $f(x, y+1) = f(x, y)$.\n\nThe Laplace-Beltrami operator on this flat manifold is the standard Laplacian $\\Delta = -(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2})$. The eigenfunctions of $\\Delta$ that satisfy the periodic boundary conditions are of the form\n$$\n\\phi_{m,n}(x,y) = \\exp\\left(i \\frac{2\\pi m x}{L}\\right) \\exp(i 2\\pi n y)\n$$\nfor integers $m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nApplying the Laplacian to these eigenfunctions:\n$$\n\\Delta \\phi_{m,n} = -\\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} \\right) \\phi_{m,n} = -\\left( \\left(i \\frac{2\\pi m}{L}\\right)^2 + (i 2\\pi n)^2 \\right) \\phi_{m,n} = \\left( \\left(\\frac{2\\pi m}{L}\\right)^2 + (2\\pi n)^2 \\right) \\phi_{m,n}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are therefore given by\n$$\n\\lambda_{m,n} = (2\\pi)^2 \\left( \\frac{m^2}{L^2} + n^2 \\right) \\quad \\text{for } (m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2.\n$$\nThe eigenvalue $\\lambda_{0,0} = 0$ corresponds to constant functions. The problem asks for the first *nonzero* eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{1}(M_L)$, which is the minimum of $\\lambda_{m,n}$ over all pairs of integers $(m,n) \\neq (0,0)$.\n$$\n\\lambda_{1}(M_{L}) = \\min_{(m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}} (2\\pi)^2 \\left( \\frac{m^2}{L^2} + n^2 \\right) = (2\\pi)^2 \\min_{(m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}} \\left( \\frac{m^2}{L^2} + n^2 \\right)\n$$\nTo find this minimum, we test the smallest possible non-zero integer values for $m$ and $n$:\n-   If $m=\\pm 1, n=0$: the term is $\\frac{1}{L^2}$.\n-   If $m=0, n=\\pm 1$: the term is $1$.\n-   If $|m| \\ge 1, |n| \\ge 1$: the term is $\\frac{m^2}{L^2} + n^2 \\ge \\frac{1}{L^2} + 1$, which is larger than both previous cases.\nOther cases with larger $|m|$ or $|n|$ will also yield larger values.\n\nThe minimum is therefore the smaller of the first two cases:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1}(M_L) = (2\\pi)^2 \\min\\left(\\frac{1}{L^2}, 1\\right)\n$$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Cheeger Constant $h(M_{L})$**\n\nThe Cheeger constant is defined as $h(M_{L}) = \\inf_{\\Omega} \\frac{\\operatorname{Area}(\\partial \\Omega)}{\\min(\\operatorname{Vol}(\\Omega), \\operatorname{Vol}(M_{L}\\setminus \\Omega))}$. The total volume of the torus is $\\operatorname{Vol}(M_L) = L \\times 1 = L$.\n\nFor a flat rectangular torus, it is a known (though non-trivial) result that the infimum is achieved by domains bounded by one or more parallel closed geodesics. These domains are \"bands\" or \"strips\" that wrap around the torus. We need to consider bands in both directions.\n\n-   **Case 1: Vertical Bands.**\n    Consider a domain $\\Omega_v$ defined by a vertical strip of width $w$, e.g., $\\Omega_v = [0, w] \\times [0, 1]$. Its boundary $\\partial \\Omega_v$ consists of two vertical closed geodesics of length $1$. The total boundary length is $\\operatorname{Area}(\\partial \\Omega_v) = 1+1=2$. The volume is $\\operatorname{Vol}(\\Omega_v) = w \\times 1 = w$. The term in the denominator of the Cheeger definition is $\\min(w, L-w)$. To find the minimum ratio for this family of domains, we must maximize the denominator, which occurs at $w=L/2$. This gives a value for the ratio of $\\frac{2}{L/2} = \\frac{4}{L}$.\n\n-   **Case 2: Horizontal Bands.**\n    Consider a domain $\\Omega_h$ defined by a horizontal strip of width $w$, e.g., $\\Omega_h = [0, L] \\times [0, w]$. Its boundary $\\partial \\Omega_h$ consists of two horizontal closed geodesics of length $L$. The total boundary length is $\\operatorname{Area}(\\partial \\Omega_h) = L+L=2L$. The volume is $\\operatorname{Vol}(\\Omega_h) = L \\times w$. The term in the denominator is $\\min(Lw, L-Lw) = L\\min(w, 1-w)$. This is maximized at $w=1/2$, giving a value of $L/2$. The ratio is then $\\frac{2L}{L/2} = 4$.\n\nThe Cheeger constant $h(M_L)$ is the infimum over all possible partitions, so it is the minimum of the values obtained from these optimal band configurations.\n$$\nh(M_{L}) = \\min\\left(\\frac{4}{L}, 4\\right)\n$$\n\n**3. Calculation of the Ratio $R(L)$**\n\nThe ratio to compute is $R(L) = \\frac{\\lambda_{1}(M_{L})}{h(M_{L})^{2}/4}$. We evaluate this based on the value of $L$.\n\n-   **Case A: $L \\ge 1$.**\n    In this case, $\\frac{1}{L^2} \\le 1$ and $\\frac{4}{L} \\le 4$.\n    $\\lambda_{1}(M_{L}) = (2\\pi)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{L^2}\\right) = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{L^2}$.\n    $h(M_{L}) = \\frac{4}{L}$.\n    The denominator of the ratio is $h(M_{L})^2/4 = \\left(\\frac{4}{L}\\right)^2 / 4 = \\frac{16/L^2}{4} = \\frac{4}{L^2}$.\n    The ratio is $R(L) = \\frac{4\\pi^2/L^2}{4/L^2} = \\pi^2$.\n\n-   **Case B: $L < 1$.** (The problem implies $L > 0$).\n    In this case, $\\frac{1}{L^2} > 1$ and $\\frac{4}{L} > 4$.\n    $\\lambda_{1}(M_{L}) = (2\\pi)^2 (1) = 4\\pi^2$.\n    $h(M_{L}) = 4$.\n    The denominator of the ratio is $h(M_{L})^2/4 = 4^2 / 4 = 4$.\n    The ratio is $R(L) = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{4} = \\pi^2$.\n\nIn both cases, the ratio $R(L)$ is a constant, $\\pi^2$.\n\n**4. Explanation of Suboptimality of Cheeger's Bound**\n\nCheeger's inequality states that for any compact Riemannian manifold $M$, $\\lambda_1(M) \\ge \\frac{h(M)^2}{4}$. This is equivalent to stating that the ratio $R(L) = \\frac{\\lambda_{1}(M_{L})}{h(M_{L})^{2}/4}$ must be greater than or equal to $1$.\n\nOur calculation shows that for the flat torus $M_L$, $R(L) = \\pi^2 \\approx 9.87$. Since $\\pi^2 > 1$, the inequality is strict, meaning the lower bound provided by Cheeger's inequality is not achieved. It is therefore suboptimal for this manifold.\n\nThe suboptimality arises from the differing nature of the functions that realize the extremal values for $\\lambda_1$ and $h$.\n-   The first eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ is the minimum of the Rayleigh quotient $\\int |\\nabla f|^2 / \\int f^2$, which is achieved by a very smooth eigenfunction (a pure sinusoid on the unfolded torus, like $\\cos(2\\pi x/L)$ for $L \\ge 1$).\n-   The Cheeger constant $h$, on the other hand, is found by considering partitions of the manifold. The optimal partitions for the flat torus are bounded by straight lines, which are \"sharp\" boundaries. The test functions implicitly associated with these partitions are discontinuous step functions (after smoothing, they still possess a very large gradient localized near the boundary).\n\nThe proof of Cheeger's inequality connects these two quantities using analytical tools (like the coarea formula and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality) that are not sharp when applied to the smooth sinusoidal profile of the first eigenfunction. The discrepancy between the Rayleigh quotient of a sinusoid and the value estimated using a step-function-like profile results in a constant factor. For problems that are essentially one-dimensional (as this one becomes for $L \\gg 1$ or $L \\ll 1$), this factor is precisely $\\pi^2$. A similar result holds for the 1D circle, which is the quintessential example of this phenomenon. Thus, the bound is suboptimal because the eigenfunction is \"maximally smooth\" in a way that the inequalities in Cheeger's proof do not fully capture.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi^{2}}$$", "id": "2970799"}, {"introduction": "Moving from compact manifolds without boundary to domains in the plane, this problem explores the Cheeger inequality in an asymptotic limit.

By definition, $h(\\Omega) \\le \\frac{P(E)}{|E|}$ for any such set $E$.\n\n**Case 1: Radial Sectors**\n\nLet's consider the family of radial sectors $S_{\\theta} = \\{ (\\rho,\\vartheta) : r < \\rho < R, \\, 0 < \\vartheta < \\theta \\}$ for $\\theta \\in (0, 2\\pi]$.\nThe boundary $\\partial S_{\\theta}$ of such a sector consists of two radial line segments and two circular arcs.\nThe lengths of the radial segments are both $R-r$.\nThe length of the inner circular arc is $r\\theta$.\nThe length of the outer circular arc is $R\\theta$.\nThe total perimeter of $S_{\\theta}$ is $P(S_{\\theta}) = 2(R-r) + r\\theta + R\\theta = 2(R-r) + (R+r)\\theta$.\nThe area of $S_{\\theta}$ is given by the integral in polar coordinates:\n$$\n|S_{\\theta}| = \\int_{0}^{\\theta} \\int_{r}^{R} \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\vartheta = \\theta \\left[ \\frac{\\rho^2}{2} \\right]_{r}^{R} = \\frac{\\theta}{2}(R^2 - r^2) = \\frac{\\theta}{2}(R-r)(R+r).\n$$\nThe ratio of the perimeter to the area is:\n$$\n\\frac{P(S_{\\theta})}{|S_{\\theta}|} = \\frac{2(R-r) + (R+r)\\theta}{\\frac{\\theta}{2}(R-r)(R+r)} = \\frac{2(R-r)}{\\frac{\\theta}{2}(R-r)(R+r)} + \\frac{(R+r)\\theta}{\\frac{\\theta}{2}(R-r)(R+r)} = \\frac{4}{\\theta(R+r)} + \\frac{2}{R-r}.\n$$\nTo find the best upper bound from this family, we need to find the infimum of this expression for $\\theta \\in (0, 2\\pi]$. The expression is a decreasing function of $\\theta$. Therefore, the infimum is attained at the maximum value of $\\theta$, which is $\\theta=2\\pi$.\n$$\n\\inf_{\\theta \\in (0, 2\\pi]} \\frac{P(S_{\\theta})}{|S_{\\theta}|} = \\frac{4}{2\\pi(R+r)} + \\frac{2}{R-r} = \\frac{2}{\\pi(R+r)} + \\frac{2}{R-r}.\n$$\nThis gives a first upper bound $h(\\Omega) \\le \\frac{2}{R-r} + \\frac{2}{\\pi(R+r)}$.\n\n**Case 2: Annular Caps**\n\nLet's consider the family of annular caps $A_{r,s} = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : r < |x| < s \\}$ for $s \\in (r, R)$.\nThe boundary $\\partial A_{r,s}$ consists of two circles, one of radius $r$ and one of radius $s$.\nThe perimeter is $P(A_{r,s}) = 2\\pi r + 2\\pi s = 2\\pi(r+s)$.\nThe area is $|A_{r,s}| = \\pi s^2 - \\pi r^2 = \\pi(s^2-r^2) = \\pi(s-r)(s+r)$.\nThe ratio of the perimeter to the area is:\n$$\n\\frac{P(A_{r,s})}{|A_{r,s}|} = \\frac{2\\pi(r+s)}{\\pi(s-r)(s+r)} = \\frac{2}{s-r}.\n$$\nTo find the best upper bound from this family, we seek the infimum of this expression for $s \\in (r, R)$. The function $f(s) = \\frac{2}{s-r}$ is a decreasing function of $s$. The infimum is approached as $s$ approaches $R$.\n$$\n\\inf_{s \\in (r, R)} \\frac{P(A_{r,s})}{|A_{r,s}|} = \\lim_{s \\to R^{-}} \\frac{2}{s-r} = \\frac{2}{R-r}.\n$$\nThis gives a second upper bound $h(\\Omega) \\le \\frac{2}{R-r}$.\n\nComparing the two upper bounds, we have $\\frac{2}{R-r}$ and $\\frac{2}{R-r} + \\frac{2}{\\pi(R+r)}$. Since $r, R > 0$, the term $\\frac{2}{\\pi(R+r)}$ is positive. Therefore, the second bound is smaller and provides a tighter constraint.\nThe best upper bound from these families is $h(\\Omega) \\le \\frac{2}{R-r}$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of a Lower Bound for $h(\\Omega)$**\n\nWe construct a smooth radially symmetric vector field $X(x) = f(|x|)\\frac{x}{|x|}$ on $\\Omega$. Let $\\rho = |x|$, so $X(x) = f(\\rho)\\hat{\\rho}$. The divergence of this vector field in polar coordinates is given by $\\nabla \\cdot X = \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{d}{d\\rho}(\\rho f(\\rho)) = f'(\\rho) + \\frac{f(\\rho)}{\\rho}$.\nWe require $\\nabla \\cdot X = c$ for some positive constant $c$. This yields the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\nf'(\\rho) + \\frac{f(\\rho)}{\\rho} = c.\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ODE. Multiplying by the integrating factor $\\rho$, we get $\\rho f'(\\rho) + f(\\rho) = c\\rho$, which is equivalent to $\\frac{d}{d\\rho}(\\rho f(\\rho)) = c\\rho$.\nIntegrating with respect to $\\rho$ gives $\\rho f(\\rho) = \\frac{c\\rho^2}{2} + K$, where $K$ is an integration constant.\nThus, the general solution for $f(\\rho)$ is $f(\\rho) = \\frac{c\\rho}{2} + \\frac{K}{\\rho}$.\n\nThis vector field must also satisfy the condition $|X(x)| \\le 1$ for all $x \\in \\Omega$, which translates to $|f(\\rho)| \\le 1$ for all $\\rho \\in (r, R)$. This must hold over the closed interval $[r, R]$ by continuity.\nWe want to find the maximum possible value of $c > 0$ for which there exists a constant $K$ such that $| \\frac{c\\rho}{2} + \\frac{K}{\\rho} | \\le 1$ for all $\\rho \\in [r, R]$.\n\nLet's try to find a solution where the function $f(\\rho)$ takes its extremal values of $-1$ and $1$ at the boundaries of the interval. Let's set $f(r) = -1$ and $f(R) = 1$. This yields a system of two linear equations for $c$ and $K$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{cr}{2} + \\frac{K}{r} = -1 \\\\\n\\frac{cR}{2} + \\frac{K}{R} = 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom the first equation, $K = r(-1 - \\frac{cr}{2})$. Substituting this into the second equation:\n$$\n\\frac{cR}{2} + \\frac{r}{R}\\left(-1 - \\frac{cr}{2}\\right) = 1 \\implies \\frac{cR}{2} - \\frac{r}{R} - \\frac{cr^2}{2R} = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{c}{2}\\left(R - \\frac{r^2}{R}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{r}{R} \\implies \\frac{c}{2R}(R^2 - r^2) = \\frac{R+r}{R}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{c}{2}(R-r)(R+r) = R+r\n$$\nSince $R+r > 0$, we can divide by it to find $c$:\n$$\n\\frac{c}{2}(R-r) = 1 \\implies c = \\frac{2}{R-r}.\n$$\nAs $R>r$, $c$ is positive as required. Let's find the corresponding $K$:\n$$\nK = r\\left(-1 - \\frac{cr}{2}\\right) = r\\left(-1 - \\frac{2r}{2(R-r)}\\right) = r\\left(-1 - \\frac{r}{R-r}\\right) = r\\left(\\frac{-(R-r)-r}{R-r}\\right) = -\\frac{rR}{R-r}.\n$$\nSo, the function is $f(\\rho) = \\frac{\\rho}{R-r} - \\frac{rR}{\\rho(R-r)}$.\nWe must verify that $|f(\\rho)| \\le 1$ for all $\\rho \\in [r, R]$. Let's check the derivative:\n$$\nf'(\\rho) = \\frac{1}{R-r} + \\frac{rR}{\\rho^2(R-r)} = \\frac{1}{R-r}\\left(1 + \\frac{rR}{\\rho^2}\\right).\n$$\nSince $r, R, \\rho$ are positive, $f'(\\rho) > 0$ for all $\\rho \\in (r,R)$. This means $f(\\rho)$ is strictly increasing on $[r,R]$.\nThe minimum value is $f(r)=-1$ and the maximum value is $f(R)=1$. Therefore, $-1 \\le f(\\rho) \\le 1$ for all $\\rho \\in [r,R]$, satisfying the condition $|f(\\rho)| \\le 1$.\n\nNow, for any set $E \\subset \\Omega$ of finite perimeter, the divergence theorem implies\n$$\n\\int_{E} (\\nabla \\cdot X) \\, dx = \\int_{\\partial E} X \\cdot \\nu \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{1} \\le \\int_{\\partial E} |X \\cdot \\nu| \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{1} \\le \\int_{\\partial E} |X||\\nu| \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{1}.\n$$\nSince $|X| \\le 1$ and $|\\nu|=1$, we have\n$$\n\\int_{E} (\\nabla \\cdot X) \\, dx \\le \\int_{\\partial E} d\\mathcal{H}^{1} = P(E).\n$$\nWith $\\nabla \\cdot X = c = \\frac{2}{R-r}$, we have\n$$\n\\int_{E} c \\, dx = c |E| = \\frac{2}{R-r}|E| \\le P(E).\n$$\nThis implies that for any valid set $E \\subset \\Omega$, $\\frac{P(E)}{|E|} \\ge \\frac{2}{R-r}$.\nTaking the infimum over all such sets $E$, we obtain the lower bound for the Cheeger constant:\n$$\nh(\\Omega) = \\inf_{E \\subset \\Omega} \\frac{P(E)}{|E|} \\ge \\frac{2}{R-r}.\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Conclusion**\n\nFrom Part 1, we established the upper bound $h(\\Omega) \\le \\frac{2}{R-r}$.\nFrom Part 2, we established the lower bound $h(\\Omega) \\ge \\frac{2}{R-r}$.\nCombining these two inequalities, we have\n$$\n\\frac{2}{R-r} \\le h(\\Omega) \\le \\frac{2}{R-r}.\n$$\nThis forces the conclusion that the Cheeger constant of the annulus is exactly\n$$\nh(\\Omega) = \\frac{2}{R-r}.\n$$\nThe minimizing sets for the upper bound are sequences of annuli that become infinitesimally thin, approaching the full annulus $\\Omega$. For example, the sequence of sets $A_{r,s}$ as $s \\to R$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2}{R-r}}\n$$", "id": "3066938"}]}
