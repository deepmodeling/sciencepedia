This calculation underlies the hypothesis appearing in Myers' theorem on diameter bounds, which assumes a uniform positive lower bound on Ricci curvature.

No numerical rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem has been validated and is deemed valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective problem in differential geometry. All provided definitions are standard and the setup is self-contained and consistent.\n\nThe objective is to compute the Ricci curvature tensor, $\\mathrm{Ric}$, for an $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M^n, g)$ that has constant sectional curvature $k  0$. The result should be expressed in terms of the dimension $n$, the curvature constant $k$, and the metric tensor $g$.\n\nThe fundamental assumption is that for any $2$-plane $\\sigma \\subset T_p M$ at any point $p \\in M$, the sectional curvature is $K(\\sigma) = k$. It is a standard result in Riemannian geometry that a manifold has constant sectional curvature $k$ if and only if its Riemann curvature tensor $R$ has the form:\n$$\nR(X,Y)Z = k(\\langle Y,Z \\rangle X - \\langle X,Z \\rangle Y)\n$$\nfor any vector fields $X, Y, Z$. Here, $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes the inner product defined by the metric tensor $g$; i.e., $\\langle X,Y \\rangle = g(X,Y)$. We will use this form of the Riemann tensor, as it is the direct consequence of the problem's primary assumption.\n\nThe definition of the Ricci curvature tensor provided is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(X,Y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\langle R(e_{i},X)Y,e_{i}\\rangle\n$$\nwhere $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_n\\}$ is any local orthonormal frame for the tangent space $T_p M$.\n\nWe proceed by substituting the expression for the Riemann tensor $R$ into the definition of the Ricci tensor $\\mathrm{Ric}$. Let $X$ and $Y$ be two arbitrary vector fields.\n$$\nR(e_i, X)Y = k(\\langle X,Y \\rangle e_i - \\langle e_i, Y \\rangle X)\n$$\nNext, we take the inner product of this expression with the basis vector $e_i$:\n$$\n\\langle R(e_i, X)Y, e_i \\rangle = \\langle k(\\langle X,Y \\rangle e_i - \\langle e_i, Y \\rangle X), e_i \\rangle\n$$\nUsing the bilinearity of the inner product, we can separate the terms on the right-hand side. The quantities $k$, $\\langle X,Y \\rangle$, and $\\langle e_i, Y \\rangle$ are scalars and can be factored out of the inner products.\n$$\n\\langle R(e_i, X)Y, e_i \\rangle = k \\langle X,Y \\rangle \\langle e_i, e_i \\rangle - k \\langle e_i, Y \\rangle \\langle X, e_i \\rangle\n$$\nSince $\\{e_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ is an orthonormal frame, we have $\\langle e_i, e_j \\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. In particular, $\\langle e_i, e_i \\rangle = 1$ for all $i$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$\n\\langle R(e_i, X)Y, e_i \\rangle = k \\langle X,Y \\rangle - k \\langle X, e_i \\rangle \\langle Y, e_i \\rangle\n$$\nThe Ricci curvature is the sum of these terms over all $i$ from $1$ to $n$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(X,Y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( k \\langle X,Y \\rangle - k \\langle X, e_i \\rangle \\langle Y, e_i \\rangle \\right)\n$$\nWe can split the summation into two parts:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(X,Y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} k \\langle X,Y \\rangle - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} k \\langle X, e_i \\rangle \\langle Y, e_i \\rangle\n$$\nFor the first term, $k \\langle X,Y \\rangle$ is a constant with respect to the summation index $i$, so summing it $n$ times yields:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} k \\langle X,Y \\rangle = n k \\langle X,Y \\rangle\n$$\nFor the second term, we analyze the summation $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\langle X, e_i \\rangle \\langle Y, e_i \\rangle$. This is the expression for the inner product $\\langle X,Y \\rangle$ in the orthonormal basis $\\{e_i\\}$. To see this, we can write $X = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\langle X, e_j \\rangle e_j$ and $Y = \\sum_{l=1}^n \\langle Y, e_l \\rangle e_l$. Then,\n$$\n\\langle X,Y \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\sum_{j=1}^n \\langle X, e_j \\rangle e_j, \\sum_{l=1}^n \\langle Y, e_l \\rangle e_l \\right\\rangle = \\sum_{j,l=1}^n \\langle X, e_j \\rangle \\langle Y, e_l \\rangle \\langle e_j, e_l \\rangle = \\sum_{j,l=1}^n \\langle X, e_j \\rangle \\langle Y, e_l \\rangle \\delta_{jl} = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\langle X, e_j \\rangle \\langle Y, e_j \\rangle\n$$\nThus, the second term in the expression for $\\mathrm{Ric}(X,Y)$ becomes:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} k \\langle X, e_i \\rangle \\langle Y, e_i \\rangle = k \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\langle X, e_i \\rangle \\langle Y, e_i \\rangle = k \\langle X,Y \\rangle\n$$\nCombining the results for the two terms, we get:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(X,Y) = n k \\langle X,Y \\rangle - k \\langle X,Y \\rangle = (n-1) k \\langle X,Y \\rangle\n$$\nThis equation holds for any arbitrary vectors $X$ and $Y$. The expression on the right is a bilinear form.

The Ricci curvature is bounded from below by\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{g} \\ge (n-1)K g\n$$\nfor some constant $K  0$. Our goal is to derive an upper bound on the diameter, $\\mathrm{diam}(M,g)$, by relating this setup to the provided special case. The special case states that for a metric $\\hat{g}$ satisfying $\\mathrm{Ric}_{\\hat{g}} \\ge (n-1)\\hat{g}$, we have $\\mathrm{diam}(M,\\hat{g}) \\le \\pi$.\n\nTo use this special case, we must transform our given metric $g$ into a new metric $\\hat{g}$ that satisfies the condition of the special case. We are told we can use a constant scaling of the metric. Let us define a new metric $\\hat{g}$ by setting\n$$\n\\hat{g} = c g\n$$\nfor some positive constant $c$ that we will determine.\n\nThe problem provides the scaling rule for the Ricci curvature bound under such a transformation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{\\hat{g}} \\ge (n-1)\\frac{K}{c}\\hat{g}\n$$\nWe want this inequality to match the form of the special case, which is $\\mathrm{Ric}_{\\hat{g}} \\ge (n-1)\\hat{g}$. Comparing the two inequalities, we see that we must choose the constant $c$ such that the coefficient on the right-hand side becomes $1$. That is, we require:\n$$\n\\frac{K}{c} = 1\n$$\nSince we are given that $K  0$, we can solve for $c$ to find\n$$\nc = K\n$$\nThis is a positive constant, as required for a valid metric scaling.\n\nLet's now define our new metric specifically as $\\hat{g} = K g$. With this choice, the Ricci curvature bound for $(M,\\hat{g})$ is\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{\\hat{g}} \\ge (n-1) \\left(\\frac{K}{K}\\right) \\hat{g} = (n-1)\\hat{g}\n$$\nThe manifold $(M,\\hat{g})$ now satisfies all the conditions of the special case. Therefore, we can apply its conclusion to find an upper bound for the diameter of $(M,\\hat{g})$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{diam}(M,\\hat{g}) \\le \\pi\n$$\nThe final step is to relate this result back to the diameter of the original manifold $(M,g)$. The problem provides the scaling law for the diameter:\n$$\n\\mathrm{diam}(M,\\tilde{g}) = \\sqrt{c}\\,\\mathrm{diam}(M,g)\n$$\nIn our case, $\\tilde{g} = \\hat{g}$ and the scaling constant is $c=K$. Substituting these into the scaling rule gives:\n$$\n\\mathrm{diam}(M,\\hat{g}) = \\sqrt{K}\\,\\mathrm{diam}(M,g)\n$$\nWe now have two statements about $\\mathrm{diam}(M,\\hat{g})$:\n1. $\\mathrm{diam}(M,\\hat{g}) \\le \\pi$\n2. $\\mathrm{diam}(M,\\hat{g}) = \\sqrt{K}\\,\\mathrm{diam}(M,g)$\n\nCombining these two statements, we get the inequality:\n$$\n\\sqrt{K}\\,\\mathrm{diam}(M,g) \\le \\pi\n$$\nSince $K  0$, $\\sqrt{K}$ is a positive real number, so we can divide by it without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\n\\mathrm{diam}(M,g) \\le \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{K}}\n$$\nThis inequality provides an upper bound for the diameter of any manifold satisfying the given conditions.

This sharpness carries through the scaling argument, meaning our derived constant $C(K)$ is also sharp.

The problem defines $\\left(\\mathbb{T}^n, g_{\\mathrm{flat}}\\right)$ as the quotient of Euclidean space $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_{\\text{Eucl}}\\right)$ by the action of the lattice group $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. It provides standard definitions for Ricci curvature, local isometries, quotient manifolds, diameter, and a correct statement of the Bonnet-Myers theorem. All premises and definitions are standard and correct within the field of Riemannian geometry. The question posed is a standard conceptual check on the understanding of these principles. The problem is therefore scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and valid. We may proceed to a solution.\n\nLet us address the three components of the question in order.\n\n1.  **Why $\\mathrm{Ric}=0$ on $\\left(\\mathbb{T}^n, g_{\\mathrm{flat}}\\right)$?**\n    The Euclidean space $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_{\\text{Eucl}}\\right)$ is flat, which by definition means its Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero, $R_{\\text{Eucl}} \\equiv 0$. The Ricci curvature tensor, $\\mathrm{Ric}$, is the trace of the Riemann curvature tensor. Consequently, the Ricci curvature of Euclidean space is also identically zero, $\\mathrm{Ric}_{\\text{Eucl}} \\equiv 0$.\n    The torus $\\mathbb{T}^n$ is constructed as the quotient $\\mathbb{R}^n / \\mathbb{Z}^n$. The group $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ acts on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ by translations, which are isometries of the Euclidean metric. The projection map $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{T}^n$ is a Riemannian covering map. A covering map between Riemannian manifolds is a local isometry. By definition, a local isometry preserves the metric tensor in local coordinates. Since the components of the Riemann curvature tensor and its traces (like the Ricci and scalar curvatures) are computed from the metric tensor and its first and second derivatives, they are local geometric invariants. Thus, a local isometry preserves all curvature tensors. As $\\pi$ is a local isometry from the flat space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\\mathbb{T}^n$, the curvature of $\\mathbb{T}^n$ at any point $p \\in \\mathbb{T}^n$ is the same as the curvature of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ at any corresponding point $\\tilde{p} \\in \\pi^{-1}(p)$. Since $\\mathrm{Ric}_{\\text{Eucl}} \\equiv 0$, it follows that the Ricci curvature of the torus is also identically zero, $\\mathrm{Ric}_{\\mathbb{T}^n} \\equiv 0$.\n\n2.  **Why does $\\left(\\mathbb{T}^n, g_{\\mathrm{flat}}\\right)$ have a finite diameter?**\n    The torus $\\mathbb{T}^n$ can be represented as the image of the compact unit cube $[0,1]^n \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ under the quotient map $\\pi$. Specifically, $\\mathbb{T}^n = \\pi([0,1]^n)$. The image of a compact set under a continuous map is compact. Therefore, $\\mathbb{T}^n$ is a compact topological space, and as a Riemannian manifold, it is a compact metric space.\n    The diameter of a metric space $(X, d)$ is defined as $\\mathrm{diam}(X) = \\sup \\{d(x,y) : x,y \\in X\\}$. The distance function $d: X \\times X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous. For a compact space $X$, the product space $X \\times X$ is also compact. A fundamental theorem of analysis states that a continuous real-valued function on a compact set is bounded and attains its maximum. Applying this to the distance function $d_{g_{\\mathrm{flat}}}$ on the compact domain $\\mathbb{T}^n \\times \\mathbb{T}^n$, we conclude that $d_{g_{\\mathrm{flat}}}$ is bounded. Its supremum, the diameter, must therefore be finite. For instance, the diameter of $\\left(\\mathbb{T}^n, g_{\\mathrm{flat}}\\right)$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}$.\n\n3.  **Why does this not contradict Myers' theorem?**\n    Myers' theorem states that if a complete $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ has Ricci curvature satisfying $\\mathrm{Ric}(v,v) \\ge (n-1)k g(v,v)$ for all tangent vectors $v$ and for some constant **$k  0$**, then $M$ must be compact and its diameter must satisfy $\\mathrm{diam}(M) \\le \\pi/\\sqrt{k}$.\n    This is a conditional statement of the form $P \\implies Q$, where $P$ is the hypothesis \"$\\mathrm{Ric} \\ge (n-1)k$ for some $k  0$\".\n    For the flat torus $\\mathbb{T}^n$, we have $\\mathrm{Ric} \\equiv 0$. This satisfies the inequality $\\mathrm{Ric} \\ge (n-1)k$ for $k=0$. However, the crucial hypothesis of Myers' theorem is that the lower bound $k$ must be *strictly positive*, i.e., $k  0$.\n    Since for the flat torus we can only say that $\\mathrm{Ric} \\ge 0$ (i.e., $k=0$), the hypothesis $P$ of Myers' theorem is not satisfied. The theorem, therefore, does not apply to the flat torus. It makes no assertion about the compactness or diameter of manifolds where the Ricci curvature is non-negative but not strictly positive. The fact that the torus is compact and has finite diameter is due to its topology, not due to a curvature condition. An implication cannot be contradicted if its hypothesis is not met. Thus, there is no contradiction.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options.\n\n**A.** The quotient map $\\mathbb{R}^n\\to\\mathbb{T}^n$ is a local isometry, so $\\mathrm{Ric}=0$ on $\\mathbb{T}^n$ because the Euclidean metric has vanishing curvature. The manifold $\\mathbb{T}^n$ is compact, and on any compact metric space $\\mathrm{diam}$ is finite since $(x,y)\\mapsto d_{g_{\\mathrm{flat}}}(x,y)$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{T}^n\\times\\mathbb{T}^n$. Myers’ theorem requires a strictly positive lower bound $\\mathrm{Ric}\\ge (n-1)k$ with $k0$, so it does not apply when $\\mathrm{Ric}=0$.\nThis option correctly explains all three points. It correctly identifies that $\\mathrm{Ric}=0$ due to the local isometry from flat space. It correctly attributes the finite diameter to compactness. And it correctly states that Myers' theorem is not contradicted because its hypothesis ($k0$) is not met.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** Since $\\mathrm{Ric}\\ge 0$ on $\\mathbb{T}^n$, Myers’ theorem applies with $k=0$ and directly yields a finite upper bound on $\\mathrm{diam}\\left(\\mathbb{T}^n\\right)$.\nThis statement is incorrect. Myers' theorem explicitly requires $k0$. It does not apply for $k=0$. Furthermore, naively substituting $k=0$ into the diameter bound $\\pi/\\sqrt{k}$ would yield an infinite bound, which does not explain the finite diameter.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** The quotient by $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ introduces positive sectional curvature, making $\\mathrm{Ric}0$ and thus forcing a finite diameter by Myers’ theorem.\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The quotient map is a local isometry, so it preserves all curvature properties. Since the covering space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ has zero sectional curvature, the quotient space $\\mathbb{T}^n$ also has zero sectional curvature. Consequently, its Ricci curvature is $\\mathrm{Ric}=0$, not $\\mathrm{Ric}0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** On $\\mathbb{T}^n$ all geodesics are closed and have uniformly bounded length due to periodicity, which directly makes the diameter finite, independent of compactness.\nThis statement contains a factual error. A geodesic on $\\mathbb{T}^n = \\mathbb{R}^n / \\mathbb{Z}^n$ is the projection of a straight line in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Such a geodesic is closed if and only if the components of its velocity vector are rationally dependent. If they are rationally independent, the geodesic is not closed; it is dense in the torus. Additionally, the claim that finite diameter is \"independent of compactness\" is misleading; for a complete manifold like $\\mathbb{T}^n$, finiteness of diameter implies compactness (by the Hopf-Rinow theorem), so the two are intrinsically linked.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the analysis, option A provides the only correct and complete explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3056933"}]}
