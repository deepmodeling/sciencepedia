This allows us to identify a soul for Euclidean space.\n\nLet $S$ be a submanifold of $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}})$ that is compact, connected, totally convex, and without boundary.\n\n$1$. The manifold $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}})$ has sectional curvature equal to $0$ everywhere. The geodesics are straight lines. A geodesic segment between two points $p, q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the line segment $[p, q] = \\{ (1-t)p + tq \\mid t \\in [0, 1] \\}$. This segment is the unique minimizing geodesic between $p$ and $q$.\n\n$2$. The definition of a totally convex submanifold $S$ requires that for any two points $p, q \\in S$, the minimizing geodesic segment between them lies entirely in $S$. Applying this to our case, for any $p, q \\in S$, the straight line segment $[p,q]$ must be contained in $S$.\n\n$3$. This property is precisely the definition of a convex set in Euclidean space. Therefore, $S$ must be a convex subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\n$4$. We are given that $S$ is also compact. Thus, $S$ is a compact, convex subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\n$5$. We now analyze the implications of $S$ being a submanifold without boundary. Let the dimension of $S$ as a submanifold be $k$.\n    - If $k=0$, then $S$ is a discrete set of points. Since $S$ is given as connected, it must consist of a single point. A single point is a compact, convex set and a $0$-dimensional submanifold without boundary. Let's say $S=\\{p_0\\}$. This is a consistent possibility.\n    - Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $k \\ge 1$. Since $S$ is a compact, convex subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with dimension $k \\ge 1$, it must have a non-empty topological boundary, $\\partial_{top}S$, within the affine subspace it spans, unless it is the entire affine subspace. But an affine subspace of dimension $k \\ge 1$ is not compact. Therefore, $S$ must be a bounded set with a non-empty boundary in its affine hull. For example, if $k=1$, $S$ must be a line segment $[p,q]$; if $k=2$, $S$ might be a filled polygon, and so on.\n    - A standard result in differential geometry states that a compact, convex subset of $\\mathbb{R}^k$ with a non-empty interior is a $k$-manifold with boundary. For instance, the closed line segment $[p,q]$ is a $1$-manifold with boundary $\\{p,q\\}$. A closed disk in a plane is a $2$-manifold with boundary (a circle).\n    - In general, any compact, convex set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ of dimension $k \\ge 1$ is a topological $k$-manifold with boundary. The boundary of the manifold $S$ coincides with its topological boundary relative to its affine hull.\n    - This contradicts the given condition that $S$ is a submanifold *without boundary*. The only way to resolve this contradiction is to reject the assumption that $k \\ge 1$.\n\n$6$. The only remaining possibility is $k=0$. As argued before, a connected $0$-dimensional manifold is a single point. Therefore, $S$ must be a single point.\n\nThe soul theorem applies to complete, non-compact Riemannian manifolds with non-negative sectional curvature. The manifold $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}})$ is complete, non-compact, and has sectional curvature $K=0$, satisfying the conditions. The theorem asserts the existence of a soul, which is a compact, totally convex submanifold $S$ such that the manifold is diffeomorphic to the normal bundle $\\nu(S)$. We have just demonstrated that any such soul for $\\mathbb{R}^n$ must be a point. For simplicity and convenience, we can choose this point to be the origin, $S = \\{0\\}$.\n\n**Part 2: Normal Bundle and Normal Exponential Map**\n\nWe are asked to identify the normal bundle $\\nu(S)$ and derive the formula for the normal exponential map $\\exp^{\\perp} \\colon \\nu(S) \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, for the soul $S = \\{0\\}$.\n\n$1$. The soul is $S = \\{0\\}$, a $0$-dimensional submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The base space of the normal bundle $\\nu(S)$ is the single point $\\{0\\}$.\n\n$2$. The tangent space to $S$ at the point $0$ is the zero-dimensional vector space, $T_{0}S = \\{0\\}$.\n\n$3$. The tangent space to the ambient manifold $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ at the point $0$ is $T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, which is canonically isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ itself.\n\n$4$. The fiber of the normal bundle at the point $0 \\in S$, denoted $\\nu_{0}(S)$, is the orthogonal complement of $T_{0}S$ within $T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n$$ \\nu_{0}(S) = (T_{0}S)^{\\perp} \\text{ in } T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n} $$\nSubstituting $T_{0}S = \\{0\\}$, we get:\n$$ \\nu_{0}(S) = (\\{0\\})^{\\perp} = T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{n} $$\nThe orthogonal complement of the zero subspace is the entire space.\n\n$5$. Since the base space $S$ is just a single point, the total space of the normal bundle $\\nu(S)$ is simply this single fiber. Thus, $\\nu(S) = \\nu_{0}(S) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. An element of $\\nu(S)$ can be represented as a pair $(0, v)$ where $v \\in T_{0}\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. We can identify this element simply by the vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\n$6$. We now derive the formula for the normal exponential map, $\\exp^{\\perp} \\colon \\nu(S) \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The definition provided is $\\exp^{\\perp}(x, w) = \\exp_{x}(w)$, where $x \\in S$ and $w \\in \\nu_{x}(S)$.\n\n$7$. In our case, $x=0$ and the vector in the normal-bundle fiber is $v \\in T_0 \\mathbb{R}^n$. So we must compute:\n$$ \\exp^{\\perp}(0, v) = \\exp_{0}(v) $$\n\n$8$. The problem statement specifies that for $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}})$, the exponential map is given by $\\exp_{p}(v) = p+v$.\n\n$9$. Setting $p=0$, we obtain the explicit formula for the exponential map at the origin:\n$$ \\exp_{0}(v) = 0 + v = v $$\n\n$10$. Therefore, the normal exponential map, which maps an element of $\\nu(S)$ identified by $v \\in T_0\\mathbb{R}^n$ to a point in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, is given by:\n$$ \\exp^{\\perp}(v) = v $$\nThis map is the identity map from $\\nu(S) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, which is indeed a diffeomorphism, as predicted by the soul theorem.\n\nThe two requested pieces of information are the chosen soul, $S=\\{0\\}$, and the formula for the value of the normal exponential map, $\\exp^{\\perp}(v) = v$.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Verification of Nonnegative Curvature**\n\nFor a surface of revolution with a metric of the form $g = dr^{2} + f(r)^{2}\\, d\\theta^{2}$, the Gaussian curvature $K$ is given by the formula:\n$$\nK = -\\frac{f''(r)}{f(r)}\n$$\nWe are given the function $f(r) = \\tanh(r)$. We compute its first and second derivatives.\nThe first derivative is:\n$$\nf'(r) = \\frac{d}{dr}\\tanh(r) = \\operatorname{sech}^{2}(r)\n$$\nThe second derivative is:\n$$\nf''(r) = \\frac{d}{dr}\\operatorname{sech}^{2}(r) = 2\\operatorname{sech}(r) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dr}\\operatorname{sech}(r) = 2\\operatorname{sech}(r) \\cdot (-\\operatorname{sech}(r)\\tanh(r)) = -2\\operatorname{sech}^{2}(r)\\tanh(r)\n$$\nNow, we substitute $f(r)$ and $f''(r)$ into the formula for the Gaussian curvature. For $r > 0$, $\\tanh(r) \\neq 0$, so we have:\n$$\nK(r) = -\\frac{-2\\operatorname{sech}^{2}(r)\\tanh(r)}{\\tanh(r)} = 2\\operatorname{sech}^{2}(r)\n$$\nThe hyperbolic secant function is defined as $\\operatorname{sech}(r) = 1/\\cosh(r)$. Since $\\cosh(r) \\ge 1$ for all real $r$, $\\operatorname{sech}(r)$ is always positive. Therefore, $\\operatorname{sech}^{2}(r)$ is strictly positive for all $r \\in [0, \\infty)$.\nThis means that $K(r) = 2\\operatorname{sech}^{2}(r) > 0$ for all $r \\in [0, \\infty)$.\nConsequently, the condition $K \\ge 0$ is satisfied everywhere on $M$.\n\n**Part 2: Existence of a Geodesic Parallel**\n\nA parallel circle, which is a curve of constant radius $r = r_{0}$, is a geodesic if and only if its geodesic curvature, $\\kappa_{g}$, is zero. For a surface of revolution with the given metric, the geodesic curvature of a parallel at $r=r_0$ is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\kappa_{g}(r_{0}) = \\frac{f'(r_{0})}{f(r_{0})}\n$$\nFor a parallel $\\{r=r_0\\}$ with $r_0 > 0$ to be a geodesic, we require $\\kappa_{g}(r_{0}) = 0$. This implies:\n$$\n\\frac{f'(r_{0})}{f(r_{0})} = 0\n$$\nSince $r_{0} > 0$, we have $f(r_{0}) = \\tanh(r_{0}) \\neq 0$. Thus, the condition for the parallel to be a geodesic simplifies to $f'(r_{0}) = 0$.\nFrom Part 1, we calculated the derivative to be $f'(r) = \\operatorname{sech}^{2}(r)$. We need to solve for $r_0 > 0$ such that:\n$$\n\\operatorname{sech}^{2}(r_{0}) = 0\n$$\nAs established before, $\\operatorname{sech}(r_{0}) = 1/\\cosh(r_{0})$ is never zero for any finite real value of $r_{0}$. Therefore, there is no value of $r_{0} > 0$ for which $f'(r_{0})=0$.\nWe conclude that there exists no parallel circle $\\{r=r_{0}\\}$ with $r_{0}>0$ that is a closed geodesic in $M$.\n\n**Part 3: Identification of the Soul**\n\nThe problem states that $M$ is a complete, noncompact Riemannian surface. In Part 1, we verified that its Gaussian curvature satisfies $K \\ge 0$. The Cheeger–Gromoll Soul Theorem applies to such manifolds. It guarantees the existence of a soul $S$, which is a compact, totally geodesic submanifold of $M$, such that $M$ is diffeomorphic to the normal bundle of $S$.\n\nFor a $2$-dimensional manifold like $M$, a submanifold $S$ can have dimension $0$ or $1$.\n- If $\\dim(S) = 0$, the soul is a point. A point is trivially a totally geodesic submanifold.\n- If $\\dim(S) = 1$, the soul is a curve. Since the soul must be compact, it must be a closed curve. A $1$-dimensional totally geodesic submanifold is a geodesic. Therefore, a curve soul must be a closed geodesic.\n\nSo, the soul $S$ of $M$ must be either a point or a closed geodesic.\n\nThe manifold $M$ is rotationally symmetric, meaning the group of rotations $\\mathbb{S}^1$ (or $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$) acts on $M$ by isometries. Let $\\phi$ be any such isometry. If $S$ is a soul, then $\\phi(S)$ is also a soul. By the uniqueness of the soul (up to isometry), the soul $S$ must be an invariant set under the group of isometries.\n- If the soul is a point, it must be a fixed point of the rotational symmetry group. The only such point on the surface of revolution is the pole at $r=0$.\n- If the soul is a closed curve, it must be an orbit of the rotation group. The orbits are the parallel circles $\\{r=r_0\\}$ for $r_0 > 0$.\n\nCombining these facts, the soul must be either the point at $r=0$ or a parallel circle $\\{r=r_0\\}$ that is also a closed geodesic.\nIn Part 2, we proved that no parallel circle $\\{r=r_{0}\\}$ for $r_{0}>0$ is a geodesic. This eliminates the possibility of the soul being a closed curve.\nThe only remaining possibility is that the soul is the point at $r=0$.\n\nThe problem defines a diagnostic value $d$ such that $d=0$ if the soul is a point and $d=1$ if the soul is a closed geodesic. Since we have determined that the soul is the point at $r=0$, the diagnostic value is $d=0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3075268"}, {"introduction": "The Soul Theorem's conclusion is powerful, but precise: it guarantees a *diffeomorphism* to the normal bundle, not necessarily an *isometry*.

Here, the unique point of minimum distance from \"infinity\" along geodesics is the origin $p=(0,0,0)$, so the soul is $S=\\{p\\}$.\n2.  **Analysis of the \"Strengthening\":**\n    -   The normal bundle $\\nu S$ over a single point $p$ is the tangent space $T_p M$.\n    -   The fibers of this bundle are the entire vector space $T_p M \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$. The base $S$ is a point, so the base metric is trivial.\n    -   The \"product metric\" on $\\nu S = T_p M$ as defined (with flat fibers isometric to Euclidean spaces) is simply the standard flat Euclidean metric on $T_p M$.\n    -   The proposed strengthening would imply that $M$ (the paraboloid) is isometric to $T_p M \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$ equipped with the flat Euclidean metric.\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    -   An isometry preserves curvature. The paraboloid $M$ has strictly positive Gaussian curvature ($K>0$), while the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ has zero curvature ($K=0$). Since their curvatures differ, they cannot be isometric.\n    -   Therefore, the paraboloid serves as a valid counterexample, demonstrating that the diffeomorphism from the soul theorem cannot, in general, be an isometry to $\\nu S$ with a product metric.\n\nThe reasoning presented in option A is entirely correct.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B Analysis**\n\nThis option presents a more general argument based on curvature properties.\n\n1.  **The condition for a product metric:** As stated in the problem and in this option, if a metric is a product metric on a vector bundle, the sectional curvature of any $2$-plane spanned by a horizontal vector and a vertical vector must be $0$.\n2.  **Implication for $M$:** If $M$ were isometric to $\\nu S$ with such a product metric, then the sectional curvature of corresponding \"mixed\" planes on $M$ must also be zero. The vertical directions on $M$ correspond to the directions of the geodesics emanating orthogonally from the soul $S$. The horizontal directions are orthogonal to these. At a point $p \\in S$, a \"mixed\" plane is spanned by a vector $v \\in T_p S$ and a vector $w \\in \\nu_p S = (T_p S)^\\perp$.\n3.  **Hypothesis of the Soul Theorem:** The soul theorem only requires $\\mathrm{sec}_M \\ge 0$. It does not impose the stricter condition that mixed sectional curvatures must vanish.\n4.  **Existence of counterexamples:** There exist manifolds satisfying $\\mathrm{sec}_M \\ge 0$ where some mixed sectional curvatures are strictly positive. The paraboloid from option A is such an example, though in a degenerate sense since the soul is a point. More generally, away from the soul, the retraction onto the soul defines a fibration. The fibers are geodesics. For the paraboloid, the sectional curvature of any tangent plane is strictly positive. A plane spanned by a vertical vector (tangent to a radial geodesic) and a horizontal vector (orthogonal to it) has positive curvature, not zero. Thus, the metric on the paraboloid is not a product metric with respect to its soul fibration.\n\nThe argument is logically sound: the proposed strengthening imposes a strong condition on the curvature tensor of $M$ (vanishing mixed curvatures) that is not required by, nor a consequence of, the initial hypothesis ($\\mathrm{sec}_M \\ge 0$).\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option C Analysis**\n\nThis option invokes the Cheeger–Gromoll splitting theorem.\n\n1.  **The Splitting Theorem:** The theorem states that a complete Riemannian manifold $(M^n, g)$ with non-negative Ricci curvature ($\\mathrm{Ric} \\ge 0$) that contains a line (a bi-infinitely minimizing geodesic) must be isometrically a product, $M \\cong N^{n-1} \\times \\mathbb{R}$, where $N$ is a complete manifold with $\\mathrm{Ric}_N \\ge 0$.\n2.  **Analysis of the Statement:** The option claims the theorem \"forbids any isometric splitting... unless the Ricci curvature is strictly positive everywhere.\" This is incorrect. First, the theorem provides a sufficient condition *for* splitting, it does not forbid it in other cases. Second, the condition $\\mathrm{Ric} > 0$ on a complete manifold implies compactness by Myers' theorem. The manifold $M$ in the problem is noncompact, so it cannot have $\\mathrm{Ric} > 0$ everywhere. The splitting theorem applies to the $\\mathrm{Ric} \\ge 0$ case, not $\\mathrm{Ric} > 0$.\n3.  **Conclusion of the Statement:** It concludes that an isometry to a product is \"impossible in all cases\". This is factually false. The cylinder $M = S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is a complete noncompact manifold with $\\mathrm{sec}_M = 0$, so $\\mathrm{sec}_M \\ge 0$. Its soul can be taken as $S = S^1 \\times \\{0\\}$. $M$ is clearly an isometric product, and it is isometric to its normal bundle $\\nu S \\cong S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ with the product metric.\n\nThe option fundamentally misrepresents the splitting theorem and draws a false conclusion.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D Analysis**\n\nThis option argues that topological nontriviality of the normal bundle $\\nu S$ prevents the existence of a product metric.\n\n1.  **Nontrivial Bundles:** The normal bundle $\\nu S$ can indeed be topologically nontrivial.\n2.  **Product Metrics on Nontrivial Bundles:** The statement claims that this nontriviality \"prevents any choice of bundle metric on $\\nu S$ from being a product\". A \"product metric\" as defined in the problem is equivalent to the bundle admitting a flat connection. A vector bundle can be topologically nontrivial and still admit a flat connection. A classic example is the Möbius strip, which is a nontrivial line bundle over the circle $S^1$ but can be endowed with a flat metric. Therefore, the premise of this option's argument is false.\n3.  **Conclusion of the Statement:** The conclusion that \"no isometry ... can ever exist\" is an overstatement, for the same reason as in option C. We know cases where the isometry exists, such as the cylinder $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$, where the normal bundle is trivial.\n\nThe argument is based on a false premise about the relationship between bundle topology and compatible metrics.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option E Analysis**\n\nThis option describes a special case where the proposed strengthening does hold. The problem asks to identify when it can hold, so this option is relevant.\n\n1.  **The setting:** Consider $M \\cong N \\times \\mathbb{R}^k$ with the Riemannian product metric, where $N$ is a compact manifold with $\\mathrm{sec}_N \\ge 0$. This implies $\\mathrm{sec}_M \\ge 0$. $M$ is complete and noncompact. Thus, $M$ satisfies the hypotheses of the soul theorem.\n2.  **The soul:** Let $S = N \\times \\{0\\}$. $S$ is compact (as $N$ is compact), totally geodesic (as it's a factor in a product), and totally convex in $M$. Thus, $S$ is a soul of $M$.\n3.  **The normal bundle:** The normal bundle $\\nu S$ to $S = N \\times \\{0\\}$ in $M = N \\times \\mathbb{R}^k$ is the trivial bundle $S \\times \\mathbb{R}^k \\cong N \\times \\mathbb{R}^k$.\n4.  **The Isometry:** The manifold $M$ *is* $N \\times \\mathbb{R}^k$. The normal bundle $\\nu S$ is also (isomorphic to) $N \\times \\mathbb{R}^k$. The metric on $M$ is the product metric $g_N \\oplus g_{\\text{Euc}}$ by construction. The \"product metric\" on $\\nu S$ described in the problem is exactly this metric. Therefore, $M$ is isometric to $\\nu S$ with the specified product metric. The isometry is simply the identity map.\n\nThis option correctly identifies a class of manifolds—isometric products—for which the proposed strengthening holds. It correctly explains that this happens when $M$ itself is an isometric product and the soul is the compact factor.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Summary of Conclusions**\n-   Option A provides a correct and intuitive counterexample showing the strengthening is generally false.\n-   Option B provides the correct, fundamental geometric reason why the strengthening is generally false.\n-   Option C misstates a major theorem and is incorrect.\n-   Option D makes a false claim about bundle topology and metrics.\n-   Option E correctly identifies the class of cases where the strengthening holds.\n\nThe question asks for all statements that correctly explain the situation. Both A and B explain why the strengthening fails in general, and E explains when it can hold. All three are correct statements within the context of the question.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "3075249"}]}
