Its Lebesgue measure is the length of the interval:\n$$m(C_0) = 1 - 0 = 1$$\n\nAt the first step ($k=1$), we form $C_1$ by removing two open intervals, $(1/5, 2/5)$ and $(3/5, 4/5)$, from $C_0$. The length of each removed interval is $2/5 - 1/5 = 1/5$. Since we remove two such intervals, the total measure removed is $2 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}$.\nThe measure of the remaining set $C_1$ is:\n$$m(C_1) = m(C_0) - \\frac{2}{5} = 1 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{5}$$\n\nNow let's consider the second step ($k=2$). The set $C_1$ consists of three disjoint closed intervals: $[0, 1/5]$, $[2/5, 3/5]$, and $[4/5, 5/5]$. Each of these intervals has a length of $1/5$.\nThe process is applied proportionally to each of these intervals. For any interval of length $L$, the total length removed from it is $2 \\times (L/5) = 2L/5$. The remaining length is $L - 2L/5 = 3L/5$.\nThus, the measure of what remains from each interval after the removal is $3/5$ of its original measure.\nSince $C_1$ is a disjoint union of three intervals, its measure $m(C_1)$ is the sum of their lengths. The set $C_2$ is formed by applying the removal to each of these disjoint intervals. The measure of $C_2$ will therefore be $3/5$ of the measure of $C_1$:\n$$m(C_2) = \\frac{3}{5} m(C_1) = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{5} = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{25}$$\n\nWe can see a pattern emerging. At each step $k$, the total measure of the set $C_k$ is $3/5$ of the total measure of the set $C_{k-1}$. This gives us a recurrence relation:\n$$m(C_k) = \\frac{3}{5} m(C_{k-1})$$\nWith the initial condition $m(C_0) = 1$, we can solve this recurrence to find a general formula for $m(C_k)$:\n$$m(C_k) = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^k m(C_0) = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^k$$\n\nThe 2/5 Cantor set $C$ is defined as the intersection of all the sets $C_k$: $C = \\bigcap_{k=0}^{\\infty} C_k$.\nThe sequence of sets is nested: $C_0 \\supset C_1 \\supset C_2 \\supset \\dots$. Each $C_k$ is a finite union of closed intervals, so it is a closed and therefore measurable set. Since $m(C_0) = 1$ is finite, we can use the property of continuity from above for measures, which states that for a decreasing sequence of measurable sets $E_k$ with $m(E_0)  \\infty$, the measure of the intersection is the limit of the measures:\n$$m\\left(\\bigcap_{k=0}^{\\infty} E_k\\right) = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} m(E_k)$$\nApplying this property to our sequence of sets $C_k$:\n$$m(C) = m\\left(\\bigcap_{k=0}^{\\infty} C_k\\right) = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} m(C_k)$$\nSubstituting our formula for $m(C_k)$:\n$$m(C) = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^k$$\nThis is the limit of a geometric sequence with a ratio $r = 3/5$. Since $|r|  1$, the limit is 0.\n$$m(C) = 0$$\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the total measure of all the open intervals that were removed.\nAt step 1, we remove 2 intervals of length $1/5$. Total removed length $L_1 = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}$.\nAt step 2, we have $3^1=3$ intervals, and from each, we remove 2 sub-intervals. The length of each sub-interval is $(1/5)^2 = 1/25$. Total removed length $L_2 = 3 \\times 2 \\times \\frac{1}{25} = \\frac{6}{25}$.\nAt step $k$, we have $3^{k-1}$ intervals, and from each, we remove 2 sub-intervals of length $(1/5)^k$. Total removed length $L_k = 3^{k-1} \\times 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^k = \\frac{2}{5} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{k-1}$.\n\nThe total measure of the removed set is the sum of the measures of all disjoint removed intervals:\n$$m(\\text{removed set}) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} L_k = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{5} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{k-1}$$\nThis is a geometric series with first term $a = 2/5$ and common ratio $r = 3/5$. The sum is:\n$$\\text{Sum} = \\frac{a}{1-r} = \\frac{2/5}{1 - 3/5} = \\frac{2/5}{2/5} = 1$$\nThe measure of the Cantor set $C$ is the measure of the original interval $[0,1]$ minus the total measure of the parts removed:\n$$m(C) = m([0,1]) - m(\\text{removed set}) = 1 - 1 = 0$$\nBoth methods yield the same result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "1426705"}, {"introduction": "Understanding that the standard Cantor set has a Lebesgue measure of zero is more than just a mathematical curiosity; it is a powerful tool in analysis.
