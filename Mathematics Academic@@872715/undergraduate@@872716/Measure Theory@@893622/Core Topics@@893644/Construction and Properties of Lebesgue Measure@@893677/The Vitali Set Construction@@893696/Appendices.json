Since $[0] = \\mathbb{Q}$ (because $x \\sim 0$ iff $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}$), all rationals lie in the single class $\\mathbb{Q}$. As $V$ contains exactly one element from each class, there is exactly one element of $V$ in $[0] = \\mathbb{Q}$. Hence $|V \\cap \\mathbb{Q}| = 1$, so A is true.\n\nB. Suppose for contradiction that there exists $(a,b) \\subseteq V$ with $a  b$. By the density of $\\mathbb{Q}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, choose $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ with $0  q  b - a$. Pick any $y \\in (a, b - q)$ and set $x = y + q \\in (a,b)$. Then $x - y = q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, so $x \\sim y$.

Since $V$ contains at most one representative from each class, it follows $v = w$, which forces $q = 0$, a contradiction. Hence $V \\neq V + q$ for every non-zero rational $q$, so C is false.\n\nD.

We are given the fact that any Vitali set $V$ is not Lebesgue measurable.\n\nTo solve this, we will use a proof by contradiction. Let's assume the opposite of what we want to prove. Suppose that the set $W$ is indeed Lebesgue measurable. If $W$ is measurable, its Lebesgue measure, denoted $m(W)$, must be a well-defined value (either a non-negative real number or infinity). This assumption implies that one of options A, B, or C must be true.\n\nA fundamental property of the Lebesgue measure is its translation invariance. This property states that for any Lebesgue measurable set $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ and any real number $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the translated set $A+x = \\{a+x \\mid a \\in A\\}$ is also Lebesgue measurable, and its measure is identical to the measure of $A$.

By subtracting the constant $c$ from every element in $W$, we can recover the set $V$:\n$$V = W - c = W + (-c)$$\nThis equation shows that the Vitali set $V$ is simply a translation of the set $W$ by the constant vector $-c$.\n\nNow, we apply the property of translation invariance to our situation. Based on our initial assumption that $W$ is a measurable set, its translation by $-c$, which is the set $V$, must also be a measurable set. Furthermore, the translation invariance property implies their measures would be equal: $m(V) = m(W + (-c)) = m(W)$.\n\nThis conclusion, however, leads to a direct contradiction. The problem statement provides the established fact that the Vitali set $V$ is not Lebesgue measurable. Our assumption that $W$ is measurable has led us to the conclusion that $V$ must be measurable. Since a statement and its negation cannot both be true, our initial assumption must be false.\n\nTherefore, the set $W$ cannot be Lebesgue measurable.\n\nLet's examine the given options based on this deduction:\n- Options A, B, and C state that $W$ is measurable and has a measure of 0, a positive finite value, or infinity, respectively. Since we have concluded that $W$ is not measurable, all of these options are incorrect.\n- Option D states that $W$ is not a Lebesgue measurable set. This matches our conclusion perfectly.\n- Option E suggests that the measurability of $W$ depends on the specific choice of the irrational number $c$. Our proof relied only on the property of translation invariance, which holds for any real number translation. The argument is valid whether $c$ is rational or irrational. Therefore, the outcome does not depend on the specific choice of $c$, making this option incorrect.\n\nThe only statement that can be correct is that $W$ is not a Lebesgue measurable set.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1462024"}]}
