The set $S$ is obtained by removing a collection of open intervals from the initial interval $[0, 1]$. The measure of $S$ can be found by subtracting the total measure of the removed intervals from the measure of the initial interval, $m([0,1]) = 1$. Let $E$ be the union of all removed open intervals. Since the removed intervals at each step are disjoint from each other and from those removed in previous steps, the measure of their union is the sum of their lengths.\n\nAt step $k=1$, one interval of length $1/4^1 = 1/4$ is removed.\nAt step $k=2$, two intervals of length $1/4^2 = 1/16$ are removed. The total length removed is $2 \\cdot (1/16) = 1/8$.\nAt step $k$, we have $2^{k-1}$ intervals in $C_{k-1}$, and from each, we remove a central open interval of length $1/4^k$.

Let's examine the first step of the construction.\nWe start with $C_0 = [0, 1]$. We remove the central open interval of length $1/4$. The center of $[0,1]$ is $1/2$. The endpoints of the removed interval are $1/2 \\pm (1/4)/2 = 1/2 \\pm 1/8$. So, the removed interval is $(3/8, 5/8)$.\nThe set $C_1$ is therefore $C_1 = [0, 3/8] \\cup [5/8, 1]$.\n\nAll subsequent removals occur within the intervals of $C_1$. This means the set $S$ is a subset of $C_1$.\n$$S = S \\cap C_1 = S \\cap ([0, 3/8] \\cup [5/8, 1]) = (S \\cap [0, 3/8]) \\cup (S \\cap [5/8, 1])$$\nThe two sets in the union, $(S \\cap [0, 3/8])$ and $(S \\cap [5/8, 1])$, are disjoint. Therefore, the measure of their union is the sum of their measures:\n$$m(S) = m(S \\cap [0, 3/8]) + m(S \\cap [5/8, 1])$$\n\nThe construction process is symmetric with respect to the center of the initial interval, $x=1/2$. The set $C_0=[0,1]$ is symmetric about $1/2$. At each step $k$, we remove the central open interval of length $1/4^k$ from each of the $2^{k-1}$ intervals. Since the set of intervals in $C_{k-1}$ is symmetric about $1/2$, and the removal process is identical for each interval, the resulting set $C_k$ is also symmetric about $1/2$. This holds for all $k$.\nConsequently, the final set $S = \\bigcap_k C_k$ is also symmetric with respect to $x=1/2$.\n\nThis symmetry implies that the measure of the part of $S$ to the left of $1/2$ is equal to the measure of the part of $S$ to the right of $1/2$. The point $1/2$ itself is not in $S$ as it was removed in the first step (it is in $(3/8, 5/8)$).\n$$m(S \\cap [0, 1/2)) = m(S \\cap (1/2, 1])$$\nSince $S \\subset [0, 3/8] \\cup [5/8, 1]$, we have $S \\cap [0, 1/2) = S \\cap [0, 3/8]$ and $S \\cap (1/2, 1] = S \\cap [5/8, 1]$.\nTherefore, we can conclude that the measures are equal:\n$$m(S \\cap [0, 3/8]) = m(S \\cap [5/8, 1])$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $m(S)$:\n$$m(S) = m(S \\cap [0, 3/8]) + m(S \\cap [0, 3/8]) = 2 \\cdot m(S \\cap [0, 3/8])$$\nWe can now solve for the desired measure:\n$$m(S \\cap [0, 3/8]) = \\frac{1}{2} m(S)$$\nUsing our earlier result that $m(S) = 1/2$, we find:\n$$m(S \\cap [0, 3/8]) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$$", "id": "1426962"}, {"introduction": "Sets of measure zero can possess surprisingly complex and rich structures.
