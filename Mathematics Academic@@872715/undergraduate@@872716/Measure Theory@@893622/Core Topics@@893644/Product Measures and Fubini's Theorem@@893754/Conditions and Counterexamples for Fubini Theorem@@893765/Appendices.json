Then the integral is non-zero only for $y \\in [y_k, y_k+L)$.\nWithin the square $Q_k$, the function $g_n(x,y)$ is defined based on the partition of $Q_k$ into four subsquares. Let's consider the behavior of $g_n(x,y)$ as $y$ varies from $y_k$ to $y_k+L$.\nThe $y$-interval $[y_k, y_k+L)$ is split into two halves: $[y_k, y_k+L/2)$ and $[y_k+L/2, y_k+L)$.\nIf $x \\in [x_k, x_k+L/2)$, then $(x,y)$ is in a diagonal subsquare if $y \\in [y_k, y_k+L/2)$ and in an off-diagonal subsquare if $y \\in [y_k+L/2, y_k+L)$.\nThus, for $x \\in [x_k, x_k+L/2)$:\n$$ g_n(x,y) = \\begin{cases} +c_n  \\text{for } y \\in [y_k, y_k+L/2) \\\\ -c_n  \\text{for } y \\in [y_k+L/2, y_k+L) \\end{cases} $$\nThe integral over this $y$-range is:\n$$ \\int_{y_k}^{y_k+L} g_n(x,y) \\, dy = (+c_n) \\cdot (L/2) + (-c_n) \\cdot (L/2) = 0 $$\nIf $x \\in [x_k+L/2, x_k+L)$, then $(x,y)$ is in an off-diagonal subsquare if $y \\in [y_k, y_k+L/2)$ and in a diagonal subsquare if $y \\in [y_k+L/2, y_k+L)$.\nThus, for $x \\in [x_k+L/2, x_k+L)$:\n$$ g_n(x,y) = \\begin{cases} -c_n  \\text{for } y \\in [y_k, y_k+L/2) \\\\ +c_n  \\text{for } y \\in [y_k+L/2, y_k+L) \\end{cases} $$\nThe integral over this $y$-range is again:\n$$ \\int_{y_k}^{y_k+L} g_n(x,y) \\, dy = (-c_n) \\cdot (L/2) + (+c_n) \\cdot (L/2) = 0 $$\nThis holds for any square $Q_k$ in $E_{n-1}$. Thus, for any fixed $x$ (not on a dyadic rational boundary), the slice $g_n(x, \\cdot)$ integrates to zero over its support.\nTherefore, for any $n \\geq 1$ and any $x \\in [0,1]$:\n$$ \\int_0^1 g_n(x,y) \\, dy = 0 $$\nThis means the inner integral is:\n$$ I_x = \\int_0^1 f(x,y) \\, dy = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\int_0^1 g_n(x,y) \\, dy = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 0 = 0 $$\nThis holds for all $x \\in [0,1]$.\nNow we can compute the outer integral:\n$$ I = \\int_0^1 I_x \\, dx = \\int_0^1 0 \\, dx = 0 $$\nThe value of the iterated integral is 0.\n\nIt is crucial to note that this result does not imply that the function $f$ is Lebesgue integrable on $[0,1]^2$. Fubini's theorem allows the interchange of integration order if the function is absolutely integrable, i.e., $\\int_{[0,1]^2} |f(x,y)| \\, d(x,y)  \\infty$. Let's check this condition.\n\nThe sets $E_{n-1} \\setminus E_n$ for $n=1, 2, \\dots$ are disjoint and their union covers $[0,1]^2$ up to a set of measure zero ($\\cap E_n$). The area of $E_{n-1} \\setminus E_n$ is $\\text{Area}(E_{n-1}) - \\text{Area}(E_n) = 2^{-(n-1)} - 2^{-n} = 2^{-n}$.\n\nFor any point $(x,y) \\in E_{k-1} \\setminus E_k$, its potential is determined by its history up to step $k$. Such a point was in a diagonal region for steps $1, \\dots, k-1$ and in an off-diagonal region at step $k$. For all subsequent steps $jk$, $g_j(x,y)=0$.\nSo, for $(x,y) \\in E_{k-1} \\setminus E_k$:\n$g_1(x,y) = +c_1$\n$g_2(x,y) = +c_2$\n...\n$g_{k-1}(x,y) = +c_{k-1}$\n$g_k(x,y) = -c_k$\n$g_j(x,y) = 0$ for $jk$.\nThe value of the function on this set is constant: $f(x,y) = \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{k-1} c_j\\right) - c_k$.\n\nLet's compute the integral of $|f|$:\n$$ \\int_{[0,1]^2} |f| \\, d\\lambda = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\int_{E_{n-1} \\setminus E_n} |f| \\, d\\lambda = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left|\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} c_j - c_n\\right| \\cdot \\text{Area}(E_{n-1} \\setminus E_n) $$\nWith $c_j = 4^j$, the sum is a geometric series: $\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} 4^j = 4 \\frac{4^{n-1}-1}{4-1} = \\frac{4}{3}(4^{n-1}-1)$.\nThe term in the sum is:\n$$ \\left|\\frac{4}{3}(4^{n-1}-1) - 4^n\\right| \\cdot 2^{-n} = \\left|\\frac{1}{3}4^n - \\frac{4}{3} - 4^n\\right| \\cdot 2^{-n} = \\left|-\\frac{2}{3}4^n - \\frac{4}{3}\\right| \\cdot 2^{-n} $$\n$$ = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}4^n + \\frac{4}{3}\\right) 2^{-n} = \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{4^n}{2^n} + \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{1}{2^n} = \\frac{2}{3}2^n + \\frac{4}{3}2^{-n} $$\nNow we sum this over all $n$:\n$$ \\int_{[0,1]^2} |f| \\, d\\lambda = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}2^n + \\frac{4}{3}2^{-n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 2^n + \\frac{4}{3}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n $$\nThe first series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 2^n$ is a geometric series with ratio $r=2  1$, which diverges to infinity.
