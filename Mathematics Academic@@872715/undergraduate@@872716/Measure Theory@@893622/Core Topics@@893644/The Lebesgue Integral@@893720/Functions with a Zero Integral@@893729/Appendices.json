Is the function non-zero for every rational number $x$ in the interval $[0, 1]$?\n2. Is the Lebesgue integral of the function over $[0, 1]$ equal to zero?\n\nA fundamental principle of Lebesgue measure theory is that any countable set of real numbers has a Lebesgue measure of zero. The set of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$, is countable. Therefore, any subset of $\\mathbb{Q}$, such as $\\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0, 1]$, is also countable and has Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nAnother key principle is that if a function $f$ is zero \"almost everywhere\"—meaning the set of points where $f(x) \\neq 0$ has a measure of zero—then its Lebesgue integral is zero. Let $\\mu$ denote the Lebesgue measure. If $\\mu(\\{x \\in [0,1] \\mid f(x) \\neq 0\\}) = 0$, then $\\int_{[0,1]} f \\, d\\mu = 0$.\n\nLet's analyze each option.\n\n**A. $f(x) = \\begin{cases} \\pi  \\text{if } x \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0, 1] \\\\ 0  \\text{if } x \\in [0, 1] \\setminus \\mathbb{Q} \\end{cases}$**\n1.  **Non-zero on rationals:** For any $x \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0, 1]$, the function is defined as $f(x) = \\pi$, which is non-zero. This condition is met.\n2.  **Zero integral:** The function is non-zero only on the set $S = \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0, 1]$. As established, this set is countable and thus has Lebesgue measure zero, $\\mu(S) = 0$. Since the function is zero almost everywhere, its Lebesgue integral is zero. More formally, $\\int_{[0,1]} f \\, d\\mu = \\int_{S} \\pi \\, d\\mu + \\int_{[0,1]\\setminus S} 0 \\, d\\mu = \\pi \\cdot \\mu(S) + 0 = \\pi \\cdot 0 = 0$. This condition is met.\nTherefore, option A is a correct choice.\n\n**B. $f(x) = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } x \\in \\{1, 1/2, 1/3, \\dots\\} \\\\ 0  \\text{otherwise on } [0,1] \\end{cases}$**\n1.  **Non-zero on rationals:** Consider the rational number $x = 2/3$, which is in $[0, 1]$. This number is not in the set $\\{1, 1/2, 1/3, \\dots\\}$. According to the definition, $f(2/3) = 0$. Since the function is zero for at least one rational number in $[0, 1]$, it is not non-zero on *all* rational numbers in the interval. This condition is not met.\nTherefore, option B is incorrect.\n\n**C. The Cantor function**\n1.  **Non-zero on rationals:** The standard Cantor function $f_C(x)$ is defined on $[0,1]$ such that $f_C(0)=0$ and $f_C(1)=1$. Since $f_C(0)=0$ and $0$ is a rational number, the function is not non-zero on all rational numbers in $[0,1]$. This condition is not met.\n2.  **Zero integral:** The Cantor function is non-negative and strictly increasing on the set $[0,1]$ minus the intervals removed during its construction. Its integral can be shown to be $\\int_0^1 f_C(x) \\, dx = 1/2$, which is not zero. This condition is also not met.\nTherefore, option C is incorrect.\n\n**D. $f(x) = \\begin{cases} 1/q  \\text{if } x = p/q \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\cap (0, 1] \\text{ in lowest terms}, q0 \\\\ 1  \\text{if } x = 0 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } x \\in [0, 1] \\setminus \\mathbb{Q} \\end{cases}$**\n1.  **Non-zero on rationals:** For any rational $x \\in (0, 1]$, we can write it as a fraction $p/q$ in lowest terms where $p,q$ are positive integers. The function value is $f(x)=1/q$, which is non-zero. For the rational number $x=0$, the function value is $f(0)=1$, which is non-zero. Thus, the function is non-zero for all rational numbers in $[0, 1]$. This condition is met.\n2.  **Zero integral:** The function is non-zero only on the set $S = \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0, 1]$. As with option A, this set has Lebesgue measure zero. Since the function is zero almost everywhere, its Lebesgue integral is zero. This condition is met.\nTherefore, option D is a correct choice.\n\n**E. $f(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$**\n1.  **Non-zero on rationals:** Consider the rational number $x=0$. We have $f(0) = \\sin(0) = 0$. Also, for the rational number $x=1$, we have $f(1) = \\sin(\\pi) = 0$. Since the function is zero for some rationals in the interval, this condition is not met.\n2.  **Zero integral:** The integral is $\\int_0^1 \\sin(\\pi x) \\, dx = \\left[-\\frac{\\cos(\\pi x)}{\\pi}\\right]_0^1 = \\left(-\\frac{-1}{\\pi}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\right) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}$. This is not zero. This condition is also not met.\nTherefore, option E is incorrect.\n\nIn summary, options A and D are the only functions that satisfy both required properties.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "1420665"}, {"introduction": "Finally, we apply the zero-integral concept in a more advanced setting: approximation theory.
