The square of a measurable function is measurable, so $h(x)$ is a measurable function.\nFurthermore, since the square of any real number is non-negative, we have $h(x) = (f(x) - g(x))^2 \\geq 0$ for all $x \\in X$. So, $h$ is a non-negative measurable function.\n\nThe given condition in the problem is $\\int_X h(x) d\\mu = 0$.\n\nA fundamental property of the Lebesgue integral states that if $h$ is a non-negative measurable function on a measure space $(X, \\mathcal{M}, \\mu)$, then its integral over $X$ is zero if and only if the function itself is zero almost everywhere.\n\"Almost everywhere\" (often abbreviated as a.e.) means that the set of points where the function is not zero has a measure of zero.\n\nApplying this property to our function $h(x)$, the condition $\\int_X h(x) d\\mu = 0$ is equivalent to the statement that $h(x) = 0$ for almost every $x \\in X$.\nLet's analyze what $h(x)=0$ implies for $f$ and $g$.\n$h(x) = (f(x) - g(x))^2 = 0$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n$f(x) - g(x) = 0$\nWhich is equivalent to:\n$f(x) = g(x)$\n\nTherefore, the condition $\\int_X (f-g)^2 d\\mu = 0$ implies that $f(x) = g(x)$ for almost every $x \\in X$.\nBy definition, this means that the set of points where $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are not equal is a set of measure zero. Let this set be $E = \\{x \\in X \\mid f(x) \\neq g(x)\\}$. Then, the conclusion is that $\\mu(E) = 0$.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\nA. $f(x) = g(x)$ for every $x \\in X$. This is too strong. The conclusion is that they are equal \"almost everywhere,\" which allows for them to differ on a set of measure zero. For example, if $X = [0,1]$ with the Lebesgue measure, and $f(x)=1$ for all $x$, while $g(x) = 1$ for $x \\neq 0.5$ and $g(0.5)=0$. Here $f(x) \\neq g(x)$ at $x=0.5$, but the set $\\{0.5\\}$ has measure zero. The integral $\\int_{[0,1]} (f-g)^2 d\\mu$ would be zero, but option A is false.\n\nB. The set $E = \\{x \\in X \\mid f(x) \\neq g(x)\\}$ has measure zero, i.e., $\\mu(E)=0$. This is the precise definition of $f(x) = g(x)$ almost everywhere, which is the correct conclusion we derived.\n\nC. The integrals of the functions are equal, i.e., $\\int_X f(x) d\\mu = \\int_X g(x) d\\mu$. While it is true that if $f=g$ almost everywhere then their integrals are equal (assuming they are integrable), this statement is a consequence of statement B and is less precise. B describes the relationship between the functions themselves at a pointwise (a.e.) level, whereas C only compares a single numerical property (their total integral). One can easily construct functions $f$ and $g$ such that their integrals are equal, but $\\int_X (f-g)^2 d\\mu \\neq 0$. For instance, on $[0,1]$, let $f(x)=1$ and $g(x)=2x$. $\\int_0^1 f(x) dx = 1$ and $\\int_0^1 g(x) dx = [x^2]_0^1 = 1$. However, $f \\neq g$ a.e., and $\\int_0^1 (1-2x)^2 dx = \\int_0^1 (1-4x+4x^2) dx = [x-2x^2+4x^3/3]_0^1 = 1-2+4/3 = 1/3 \\neq 0$. Thus, C is a weaker statement than B. The question asks for the most precise conclusion.\n\nD. There exists a real constant $C$ such that $f(x) = g(x) + C$ for almost every $x \\in X$. If we substitute this into the given integral, we get $\\int_X ( (g(x) + C) - g(x) )^2 d\\mu = \\int_X C^2 d\\mu = 0$. This implies $C^2 \\mu(X) = 0$. If the space has positive measure, $\\mu(X)0$, then we must have $C^2=0$, which means $C=0$. In this common case, this option reduces to $f(x)=g(x)$ a.e., which is option B. So, B is more direct and precise. If $\\mu(X)=0$, any C would work, but in this trivial case all functions are equal a.e. anyway.\n\nE. The function $f(x)g(x)$ is equal to zero for almost every $x \\in X$. This is incorrect. Consider $f(x) = g(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in X$ where $\\mu(X)0$. Then $\\int_X(1-1)^2 d\\mu = 0$, but $f(x)g(x) = 1$ for all $x$.\n\nThus, the most precise and general conclusion is that the set where $f$ and $g$ differ has measure zero.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1439532"}, {"introduction": "The Lebesgue integral is famously more powerful than the Riemann integral, in part because it can handle highly discontinuous and even unbounded functions.
