In our case, we will check for absolute continuity on the subintervals $[-1, 0]$ and $[0, 1]$ and ensure the function is continuous on the entire interval $[-1, 1]$.\n\nFirst, let's check for continuity of $f(x)$ on $[-1, 1]$. The function is defined by elementary functions on $[-1, 0)$ and $(0, 1]$, so it is continuous there. We only need to check continuity at $x=0$. For continuity at $x=0$, we require $\\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f(x) = f(0)$ and $\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(x) = f(0)$.\nWe are given $f(0)=0$.\nThe limit from the left is:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} |x|^{\\beta} = \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} (-x)^{\\beta} $$\nSince $\\beta > 0$ is given, this limit is $0$.\nThe limit from the right is:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} x^{\\alpha} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2x}\\right) $$\nSince $\\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2x}\\right)\\right| \\le 1$, we have $0 \\le \\left|x^{\\alpha} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2x}\\right)\\right| \\le x^{\\alpha}$.

By the Squeeze Theorem, the limit is $0$.\nSince both limits are equal to $f(0)$, the function $f(x)$ is continuous on $[-1, 1]$ for all given positive $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\nNext, we use the theorem relating absolute continuity to the integrability of the derivative on each subinterval.\n\n1.  **Absolute continuity on $[-1, 0]$**:\n    Let $g(x) = f(x)$ for $x \\in [-1, 0]$.

We check the integrability of $|g'(x)|$:\n    $$ \\int_{-1}^{0} |g'(x)| dx = \\int_{-1}^{0} |-\\beta(-x)^{\\beta-1}| dx = \\beta \\int_{-1}^{0} (-x)^{\\beta-1} dx $$\n    Let $u = -x$, so $du = -dx$.
