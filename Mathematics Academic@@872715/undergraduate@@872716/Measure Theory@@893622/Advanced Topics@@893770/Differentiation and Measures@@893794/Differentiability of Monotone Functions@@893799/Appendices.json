Both $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are polynomials and are differentiable everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}$. The function $f(x)$ will be differentiable at all points except possibly where the definition of the function switches. The switch occurs at points $x$ where $g(x) = h(x)$.\n\nFirst, we must find these points by solving the equation $x = x^3$.\n$$x^3 - x = 0$$\n$$x(x^2 - 1) = 0$$\n$$x(x-1)(x+1) = 0$$\nThe solutions are $x = -1$, $x = 0$, and $x = 1$. These are the candidate points where $f(x)$ might not be differentiable. At all other points, $f(x)$ is equal to either $x$ or $x^3$ on an open interval, and is therefore differentiable on those intervals.\n\nTo analyze the differentiability at these points, we first establish the piecewise definition of $f(x)$. We need to determine whether $x$ or $x^3$ is larger on the intervals separated by $-1, 0, 1$.\n1.  For $x > 1$: Let's take $x=2$. We have $x=2$ and $x^3=8$. Thus, $x^3 > x$, so $f(x) = x^3$.\n2.  For $0  x  1$: Let's take $x=0.5$. We have $x=0.5$ and $x^3=0.125$. Thus, $x > x^3$, so $f(x) = x$.\n3.  For $-1  x  0$: Let's take $x=-0.5$. We have $x=-0.5$ and $x^3=-0.125$. Thus, $x^3 > x$, so $f(x) = x^3$.\n4.  For $x  -1$: Let's take $x=-2$. We have $x=-2$ and $x^3=-8$.
