## Introduction
In [measure theory](@entry_id:139744), the transition from standard measures to [signed measures](@entry_id:198637) opens up a richer analytical landscape, allowing us to model quantities that can be both positive and negative, such as [electrical charge](@entry_id:274596) or financial profit and loss. However, this generalization introduces a challenge: how can we systematically understand and decompose a function that assigns both positive and negative values to sets? The key lies in partitioning the underlying space into regions where the measure behaves consistently.

This article addresses this challenge by introducing the fundamental concepts of positive, negative, and [null sets](@entry_id:203073) for a [signed measure](@entry_id:160822). These classifications provide the essential building blocks for decomposing any [signed measure](@entry_id:160822) into more intuitive positive and negative components. Through the chapters, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of this core theoretical tool. "Principles and Mechanisms" establishes the formal definitions, explores key properties, and culminates in the pivotal Hahn Decomposition Theorem. Following this, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" demonstrates how this decomposition provides crucial insights in fields ranging from probability theory to [differential geometry](@entry_id:145818). Finally, "Hands-On Practices" offers a series of guided problems to reinforce these concepts and build your computational skills.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In the study of measure theory, we often extend the concept of a measure, which assigns non-negative values to sets, to a **[signed measure](@entry_id:160822)**, which can assign both positive and negative values. This generalization allows us to model phenomena such as charge distributions or net financial balances over a region. To systematically analyze the behavior of a [signed measure](@entry_id:160822), we must develop a way to understand where it is "positive," "negative," or "zero." This chapter introduces the foundational concepts of positive, negative, and [null sets](@entry_id:203073), which form the building blocks for decomposing any [signed measure](@entry_id:160822) into more manageable components.

### Defining Positive, Negative, and Null Sets

Let $(X, \mathcal{M})$ be a [measurable space](@entry_id:147379) and $\nu$ be a [signed measure](@entry_id:160822) on it. The core idea is to classify measurable sets based on the sign of the measure of all their measurable subsets. This leads to the following fundamental definitions.

A measurable set $P \in \mathcal{M}$ is called a **positive set** with respect to $\nu$ if for every measurable subset $A \subseteq P$, we have $\nu(A) \ge 0$.

A measurable set $N \in \mathcal{M}$ is called a **negative set** with respect to $\nu$ if for every measurable subset $A \subseteq N$, we have $\nu(A) \le 0$.

A measurable set $E \in \mathcal{M}$ is called a **[null set](@entry_id:145219)** (or $\nu$-[null set](@entry_id:145219)) if it is both a positive set and a negative set. This means that for every measurable subset $A \subseteq E$, we must have $\nu(A) \ge 0$ and $\nu(A) \le 0$, which implies $\nu(A) = 0$.

It is essential to recognize that any measurable subset of a positive set is also a positive set. This follows directly from the definition. If $P$ is a positive set and we take a measurable subset $A \subseteq P$, then any measurable subset $F \subseteq A$ is also a measurable subset of $P$. Since $P$ is positive, $\nu(F) \ge 0$. This satisfies the definition for $A$ to be a positive set [@problem_id:1436346]. An analogous property holds for negative sets.

To make these abstract definitions more concrete, consider a finite space $X = \{a, b, c, d\}$ with the [power set](@entry_id:137423) as its $\sigma$-algebra. Let a [signed measure](@entry_id:160822) be defined by $\nu(E) = \sum_{x \in E} f(x)$, where $f(a) = 3$, $f(b) = -4$, $f(c) = 5$, and $f(d) = -1$. The set $P = \{a, c\}$ is a positive set because any subset of $P$ (which would be $\emptyset, \{a\}, \{c\},$ or $\{a, c\}$) has a non-negative measure ($\nu(\emptyset)=0, \nu(\{a\})=3, \nu(\{c\})=5, \nu(\{a,c\})=8$). The set $A = \{c\}$ is a subset of $P$. Its only measurable subsets are $\emptyset$ and $\{c\}$, with measures $\nu(\emptyset)=0$ and $\nu(\{c\})=5$. Since both are non-negative, $A$ is a positive set, illustrating the general principle [@problem_id:1436346].

A frequent point of confusion is the distinction between a set $A$ for which $\nu(A) = 0$ and a set $A$ that is $\nu$-null. A $\nu$-[null set](@entry_id:145219) requires the measure of *all* its measurable subsets to be zero, which is a much stronger condition. Consider the [signed measure](@entry_id:160822) $\nu(E) = \int_E \cos(x) \, dx$ on the interval $[0, \pi]$. The measure of the entire set $A = [0, \pi]$ is $\nu(A) = \int_0^\pi \cos(x) \, dx = [\sin(x)]_0^\pi = 0$. However, $A$ is not a [null set](@entry_id:145219). To see this, consider the subset $F = [0, \pi/2] \subseteq A$. Its measure is $\nu(F) = \int_0^{\pi/2} \cos(x) \, dx = 1 > 0$. Since we have found a subset with non-zero measure, $A$ cannot be a [null set](@entry_id:145219), despite $\nu(A)=0$ [@problem_id:1436343].

This raises the question: what is the correct condition for a set to be null? The answer lies in the concept of the **[total variation measure](@entry_id:193822)**, denoted $| \nu |$. For any measurable set $E$, $| \nu |(E)$ is a non-negative measure that quantifies the "total magnitude" of the [signed measure](@entry_id:160822) $\nu$ on $E$. A crucial result, which we will use as a defining property, states that a [measurable set](@entry_id:263324) $E$ is $\nu$-null if and only if $| \nu |(E) = 0$ [@problem_id:1436309]. If $| \nu |(E)=0$, then for any measurable subset $A \subseteq E$, the monotonicity of measures implies $0 \le | \nu |(A) \le | \nu |(E) = 0$. Since it is a fundamental property that $| \nu(A) | \le | \nu |(A)$, we have $| \nu(A) | = 0$, which means $\nu(A) = 0$. This holds for all subsets $A$, so $E$ is a [null set](@entry_id:145219). Conversely, if $E$ is null, $\nu(A)=0$ for all $A \subseteq E$, which can be shown to imply $| \nu |(E) = 0$.

### Fundamental Properties

Positive, negative, and [null sets](@entry_id:203073) have several important structural properties that are essential for their application.

1.  **Union of Positive/Negative Sets**: A countable union of positive sets is also a positive set. To see this for two positive sets $P_1$ and $P_2$, consider their union $P = P_1 \cup P_2$. Let $A$ be any measurable subset of $P$. We can write $A = (A \cap P_1) \cup (A \setminus P_1)$. Note that $A \cap P_1$ is a subset of the positive set $P_1$, so $\nu(A \cap P_1) \ge 0$. Also, $A \setminus P_1 = A \cap P_1^c \subseteq P_2$, so $A \setminus P_1$ is a subset of the positive set $P_2$, which implies $\nu(A \setminus P_1) \ge 0$. Since these two sets are disjoint, the additivity of the [signed measure](@entry_id:160822) gives $\nu(A) = \nu(A \cap P_1) + \nu(A \setminus P_1) \ge 0 + 0 = 0$. As this holds for any $A \subseteq P$, the union $P_1 \cup P_2$ is a positive set. This principle can be extended to any countable union. A computational problem can illustrate the properties of these unions and the additivity of [signed measures](@entry_id:198637) [@problem_id:1436339].

2.  **Intersection of Positive and Negative Sets**: The intersection of a positive set $P$ and a negative set $N$ is always a $\nu$-[null set](@entry_id:145219). Let $E = P \cap N$. For any measurable subset $A \subseteq E$, $A$ is also a subset of $P$, so $\nu(A) \ge 0$. Simultaneously, $A$ is a subset of $N$, so $\nu(A) \le 0$. The only way to satisfy both inequalities is to have $\nu(A) = 0$. Since this holds for any measurable subset $A$ of $E$, the intersection $E = P \cap N$ is, by definition, a [null set](@entry_id:145219) [@problem_id:1436331]. This property is quite useful. For example, if we have a set $A$ contained in a positive set and a set $B$ contained in a negative set, we know immediately that $\nu(A \cap B) = 0$. The [inclusion-exclusion principle](@entry_id:264065) for [signed measures](@entry_id:198637), $\nu(A \cup B) = \nu(A) + \nu(B) - \nu(A \cap B)$, then simplifies to $\nu(A \cup B) = \nu(A) + \nu(B)$ [@problem_id:1436331].

### The Hahn Decomposition Theorem

The concepts of positive and negative sets culminate in one of the central results in the theory of [signed measures](@entry_id:198637): the Hahn Decomposition Theorem.

**Theorem (Hahn Decomposition):** For any [signed measure](@entry_id:160822) space $(X, \mathcal{M}, \nu)$, there exists a partition of $X$ into a positive set $P$ and a negative set $N$. That is, $P \in \mathcal{M}$, $N \in \mathcal{M}$, $P \cup N = X$, and $P \cap N = \emptyset$. The pair $(P, N)$ is called a Hahn decomposition of $X$ for $\nu$.

This powerful theorem asserts that we can always split the entire space into two disjoint regions: one where the measure is "accumulating" positively, and another where it is "accumulating" negatively.

A natural question arises: is this decomposition unique? The answer is no, but it is unique in a very specific sense. If $(P_1, N_1)$ and $(P_2, N_2)$ are two Hahn decompositions for the same [signed measure](@entry_id:160822) $\nu$, then their symmetric differences, $P_1 \Delta P_2$ and $N_1 \Delta N_2$, are $\nu$-[null sets](@entry_id:203073). To understand this, consider the set $P_1 \setminus P_2 = P_1 \cap N_2$. This is an intersection of a positive set ($P_1$) and a negative set ($N_2$), so it must be a [null set](@entry_id:145219). By symmetry, $P_2 \setminus P_1 = P_2 \cap N_1$ is also a [null set](@entry_id:145219). The [symmetric difference](@entry_id:156264) is the union of these two disjoint [null sets](@entry_id:203073), $P_1 \Delta P_2 = (P_1 \setminus P_2) \cup (P_2 \setminus P_1)$, and is therefore also a [null set](@entry_id:145219).

For example, if a [signed measure](@entry_id:160822) $\nu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure $\mu$, any set with $\mu$-[measure zero](@entry_id:137864) is also $\nu$-null [@problem_id:1436330]. If we find a Hahn decomposition where the positive part is $P_1 = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x \leq -2 \text{ or } x \geq 2\}$ and another where it is $P_2 = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x  -2 \text{ or } x > 2\}$, the symmetric difference $P_1 \Delta P_2$ is the two-point set $\{-2, 2\}$. This set has Lebesgue [measure zero](@entry_id:137864), and therefore $\nu(\{-2, 2\}) = 0$. In fact, any subset of $\{-2, 2\}$ also has [measure zero](@entry_id:137864), so $\{-2, 2\}$ is a $\nu$-[null set](@entry_id:145219), confirming the theorem [@problem_id:1436330].

### Connection to the Radon-Nikodym Derivative

The theory becomes particularly intuitive and computationally tractable when the [signed measure](@entry_id:160822) $\nu$ is **absolutely continuous** with respect to a positive measure $\mu$ (denoted $\nu \ll \mu$). The Radon-Nikodym theorem guarantees the existence of a measurable function $f$, called the Radon-Nikodym derivative, such that for any [measurable set](@entry_id:263324) $E$:
$$ \nu(E) = \int_E f \, d\mu $$

The function $f$ provides a "density" for the [signed measure](@entry_id:160822) $\nu$, and its sign directly determines the nature of the sets. The connection is as follows:

*   A set $P$ is a **positive set** if and only if $f(x) \ge 0$ for $\mu$-almost every $x \in P$.
*   A set $N$ is a **negative set** if and only if $f(x) \le 0$ for $\mu$-almost every $x \in N$.
*   A set $E$ is a **[null set](@entry_id:145219)** if and only if $f(x) = 0$ for $\mu$-almost every $x \in E$.

This provides a straightforward method for constructing a Hahn decomposition: simply define the positive set as $P = \{x \in X \mid f(x) \ge 0\}$ and the negative set as $N = \{x \in X \mid f(x)  0\}$. The sets of points where $f(x)=0$ have zero measure under $\nu$ and can be included in either $P$ or $N$ without affecting their status as positive or negative sets, respectively.

Let's revisit the [signed measure](@entry_id:160822) $\nu(E) = \int_E \cos(x) \, dx$ on $X=[0, 2\pi]$ [@problem_id:1436297]. Here, the density function is $f(x) = \cos(x)$. A set is positive if and only if $\cos(x) \ge 0$ on it. The intervals where this holds are $[0, \pi/2]$ and $[3\pi/2, 2\pi]$. Therefore, $[0, \pi/2]$ and $[3\pi/2, 2\pi]$ are positive sets, as is their union. Any set with Lebesgue [measure zero](@entry_id:137864), like $\{\pi/2, 3\pi/2\}$, is also a positive set (and a negative set, hence a [null set](@entry_id:145219)) because the integral over it is always zero. An interval like $[0, \pi]$ is not a positive set because it contains the sub-interval $(\pi/2, \pi]$, where $\cos(x)  0$, and the integral over that sub-interval would be negative. Similarly, a set like $[-1/2, 1/2]$ for the density $f(x) = x^2-x$ is neither positive nor negative, because $f(x) > 0$ on $[-1/2, 0)$ but $f(x)  0$ on $(0, 1/2]$, so one can find subsets with both positive and negative measure [@problem_id:1436315].

This framework also allows us to solve optimization problems. For instance, to find the [supremum](@entry_id:140512) of $\nu(E)$ over all [measurable sets](@entry_id:159173) $E$, we should choose $E$ to be the set where the integrand $f$ is non-negative. Any region where $f$ is negative would only decrease the value of the integral. Thus, the supremum is achieved on the positive set $P$ of a Hahn decomposition:
$$ \sup_{E \in \mathcal{M}} \nu(E) = \nu(P) = \int_P f \, d\mu $$
This value is precisely the measure of $X$ under the positive part of the Jordan decomposition, $\nu^+(X)$. For a measure defined by $\nu(E) = \int_E (x^2 - 3x + 2) \, dx$ on $[0, 3]$, the density is $f(x)=(x-1)(x-2)$. This is non-negative on $[0, 1] \cup [2, 3]$. The [supremum](@entry_id:140512) is therefore $\nu([0, 1] \cup [2, 3])$, which can be calculated by integrating $f(x)$ over this set [@problem_id:1436329].

Finally, the property that $\nu \ll \mu$ implies that any $\mu$-[null set](@entry_id:145219) is also $\nu$-null. If $\mu(A)=0$, then for any measurable subset $S \subseteq A$, we also have $\mu(S)=0$. The integral defining $\nu(S)$ is then $\int_S f \, d\mu = 0$. This means all subsets of $A$ have zero $\nu$-measure, so $A$ is $\nu$-null. This is often used in calculations involving sets like the Cantor set, which has Lebesgue [measure zero](@entry_id:137864). If a [signed measure](@entry_id:160822) is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, its value on the Cantor set (or any subset thereof) is zero, simplifying calculations [@problem_id:1436334].
