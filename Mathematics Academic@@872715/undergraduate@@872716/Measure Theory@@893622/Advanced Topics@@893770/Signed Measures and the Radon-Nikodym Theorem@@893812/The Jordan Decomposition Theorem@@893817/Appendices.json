They are defined as $P(x) = V_p(f; [a,x])$ and $N(x) = V_n(f; [a,x])$, where $V_p$ and $V_n$ are the positive and negative variations. A key property is that the total variation function is $T_f(x) = V(f;[a,x]) = P(x) + N(x)$, and both $P(x)$ and $N(x)$ are non-decreasing functions with $P(a)=N(a)=0$.\n\nIn this problem, the interval is $[0, 1]$, so $a=0$. The function is $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_n H(x - q_n)$. This is a pure jump function. The value of the function only changes at the points $x = q_n$. Let's analyze the jumps.\n\nA jump in the function occurs at a point $y$ if the left and right limits differ. The jump at a point $y$ is defined as $\\Delta f(y) = f(y^+) - f(y^-)$, where $f(y^+) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} f(y+\\epsilon)$ and $f(y^-) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} f(y-\\epsilon)$.\nFor any point $y \\in (0,1)$ which is not in the set $\\{q_n\\}$, the function is locally constant, so there is no jump.\nLet's consider a point $y = q_k$ for some index $k$.\nFor $\\epsilon  0$ small enough, the interval $(q_k - \\epsilon, q_k + \\epsilon)$ contains no other rational points from our enumeration $\\{q_n\\}$.\nThe value of $f(q_k + \\epsilon)$ is $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_n H(q_k + \\epsilon - q_n)$. The term $H(q_k + \\epsilon - q_n)$ is 1 if $q_n \\le q_k + \\epsilon$ and 0 otherwise.\nThe value of $f(q_k - \\epsilon)$ is $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_n H(q_k - \\epsilon - q_n)$. The term $H(q_k - \\epsilon - q_n)$ is 1 if $q_n \\le q_k - \\epsilon$ and 0 otherwise.\nThe difference is:\n$$f(q_k + \\epsilon) - f(q_k - \\epsilon) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_n \\left(H(q_k + \\epsilon - q_n) - H(q_k - \\epsilon - q_n)\\right)$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is non-zero only if $q_k - \\epsilon  q_n \\le q_k + \\epsilon$. For small enough $\\epsilon$, this condition is only met for $n=k$. Thus, the difference is $c_k (1 - 0) = c_k$.\nSo, the jump at $q_k$ is $\\Delta f(q_k) = c_k$.\n\nThe total variation of a pure jump function on an interval is the sum of the absolute values of the jumps within that interval. The variation functions $P(x)$ and $N(x)$ required by the theorem start from 0 at $x=0$, so they only account for jumps in the interval $(0,x]$.\nLet's consider the interval $(0, x]$. The set of jump points in this interval is $\\{q_n \\mid 0  q_n \\le x\\}$.\n\nThe total variation on $(0, x]$ is the sum of the absolute values of the jumps:\n$$T(x) = \\sum_{n: 0  q_n \\le x} |\\Delta f(q_n)| = \\sum_{n: 0  q_n \\le x} |c_n|$$\nNote that the convergence of $\\sum |c_n|$ ensures that this sum is finite for all $x \\in [0,1]$.\n\nThe positive variation $P(x)$ is the sum of all positive jumps in $(0,x]$. A jump $c_n$ is positive if $c_n  0$. We can write this contribution as $\\max(c_n, 0)$.\n$$P(x) = \\sum_{n: 0  q_n \\le x} \\max(c_n, 0)$$\n\nThe negative variation $N(x)$ is the sum of the absolute values of all negative jumps in $(0,x]$. A jump $c_n$ is negative if $c_n  0$. Its contribution to the negative variation is $|c_n| = -c_n$. We can write this as $\\max(-c_n, 0)$.\n$$N(x) = \\sum_{n: 0  q_n \\le x} \\max(-c_n, 0)$$\n\nLet's verify these results.\n1.  Are $P(x)$ and $N(x)$ non-decreasing? Yes. As $x$ increases, the set of indices in the sum grows, and since $\\max(c_n, 0) \\ge 0$ and $\\max(-c_n, 0) \\ge 0$, the sums are non-decreasing.\n2.  Do they vanish at $x=0$? Yes. For $x=0$, the condition $0  q_n \\le 0$ is never satisfied, so the sums are over an empty set, which is 0. So, $P(0)=0$ and $N(0)=0$.\n3.
