This exercise provides a concrete method for determining membership by connecting the abstract definition of the $L^p$ norm to the familiar calculus concept of improper integrals. By testing when the norm of a function with a singularity remains finite, you will develop a tangible intuition for how the exponent $p$ acts as a gatekeeper, controlling which functions are admitted into the space $L^p([0, 1])$.", "problem": "In measure theory, for a given real number $p \\in [1, \\infty)$, the space $L^p([0, 1])$ consists of all measurable functions $f: [0, 1] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ for which the $L^p$-norm is finite.

The norm is given by:\n$$\n\\|f\\|_p = \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} |f(x)|^p dx \\right)^{1/p}\n$$\nFor the given function $f(x) = x^{-1/3}$, we substitute it into the definition of the norm:\n$$\n\\|f\\|_p = \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} |x^{-1/3}|^p dx \\right)^{1/p}\n$$\nSince the interval of integration is $(0, 1]$, the base $x$ is positive. Therefore, $x^{-1/3}$ is also positive, and the absolute value is redundant. The expression becomes:\n$$\n\\|f\\|_p = \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} (x^{-1/3})^p dx \\right)^{1/p} = \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} x^{-p/3} dx \\right)^{1/p}\n$$\nFor the norm $\\|f\\|_p$ to be finite, the integral part, $\\int_{0}^{1} x^{-p/3} dx$, must be finite. This is because $p \\in [1, \\infty)$, so $1/p$ is a positive finite exponent. A positive power of a non-negative value is finite if and only if the value itself is finite.\n\nWe now need to evaluate the improper integral $I = \\int_{0}^{1} x^{-p/3} dx$ and find the condition on $p$ for which it converges. This is a standard p-integral of the form $\\int_0^a x^{-k} dx$ with $k=p/3$. Such an integral converges if and only if the exponent $-k$ is greater than $-1$, which means $k  1$.\n\nLet's verify this convergence condition. Let $k = p/3$. The integral is $\\int_{0}^{1} x^{-k} dx$.\nIf $k \\neq 1$, the antiderivative of $x^{-k}$ is $\\frac{x^{-k+1}}{-k+1}$. The definite integral is evaluated as a limit:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} x^{-k} dx = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\left[ \\frac{x^{1-k}}{1-k} \\right]_{\\epsilon}^{1} = \\frac{1^{1-k}}{1-k} - \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\epsilon^{1-k}}{1-k} = \\frac{1}{1-k} - \\frac{1}{1-k} \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\epsilon^{1-k}\n$$\nFor this expression to be finite, the limit must exist and be finite.\n- If $1-k  0$ (i.e., $k  1$), then $\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\epsilon^{1-k} = 0$. The integral converges to $\\frac{1}{1-k}$.\n- If $1-k  0$ (i.e., $k  1$), then $\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\epsilon^{1-k}$ diverges to $+\\infty$. The integral diverges.\n\nIf $k = 1$, the integral is $\\int_{0}^{1} x^{-1} dx = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} [\\ln(x)]_{\\epsilon}^1 = \\ln(1) - \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\ln(\\epsilon) = 0 - (-\\infty)$, which diverges.\n\nSo, the integral $\\int_{0}^{1} x^{-k} dx$ converges if and only if $k  1$.\n\nIn our case, $k = p/3$. The condition for $f(x) = x^{-1/3}$ to be in $L^p([0, 1])$ is that the integral converges, which means:\n$$\n\\frac{p}{3}  1 \\implies p  3\n$$\nThe function $f(x)$ belongs to $L^p([0, 1])$ for all $p \\in [1, 3)$. The problem asks for the smallest integer $p \\ge 1$ for which $f(x)$ does **not** belong to $L^p([0, 1])$. This is equivalent to finding the smallest integer $p \\ge 1$ that violates the condition $p  3$.\n\nLet's test integer values for $p$ starting from 1:\n- For $p=1$: $1  3$ is true. So, $f \\in L^1([0, 1])$.\n- For $p=2$: $2  3$ is true. So, $f \\in L^2([0, 1])$.\n- For $p=3$: $3  3$ is false. The condition for convergence is not met. At $p=3$, the exponent is $p/3 = 1$, and the integral $\\int_0^1 x^{-1} dx$ diverges. Therefore, $f \\notin L^3([0, 1])$.\n\nThe first integer value of $p \\ge 1$ for which $f(x)$ does not belong to $L^p([0, 1])$ is $p=3$. Any integer $p  3$ will also result in a divergent integral (since $p/3  1$). Hence, the set of integers $p \\ge 1$ for which the function is not in $L^p$ is $\\{3, 4, 5, \\dots\\}$. The smallest integer in this set is 3.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "1429989"}, {"introduction": "A defining feature of $L^p$ spaces is that functions are considered identical if they only differ on a set of measure zero.

This definition means we are looking for the smallest non-negative number $C$ such that the set of points where $|f(x)|$ exceeds $C$ has a measure of zero.\n\nThe function $f(x)$ is defined differently on the set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ and the set of irrational numbers $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$. Let's define a new function $g(x) = \\frac{x^3}{x^2+3}$ for all $x \\in [1, 5]$.\n\nNow, we compare the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ on the interval $[1, 5]$.\n- If $x$ is an irrational number in $[1, 5]$, then by definition, $f(x) = \\frac{x^3}{x^2+3} = g(x)$.\n- If $x$ is a rational number in $[1, 5]$, then $f(x) = 50$ and $g(x) = \\frac{x^3}{x^2+3}$.

Therefore, $\\mu(\\mathbb{Q} \\cap [1, 5]) = 0$.\n\nSince $f(x) = g(x)$ for all $x \\in [1, 5]$ except on a set of measure zero, the functions $f$ and $g$ are said to be equal almost everywhere. In the context of $L^p$ spaces, functions that are equal almost everywhere are considered equivalent and have the same norm.

Since $g(x)$ is a continuous function on the compact interval $[1, 5]$, its essential supremum is equal to its ordinary supremum (i.e., its maximum value). Furthermore, for $x \\in [1, 5]$, both $x^3$ and $x^2+3$ are positive, so $g(x)  0$. This means we need to find the maximum value of $g(x)$ on $[1, 5]$, as $|g(x)| = g(x)$.\n\nTo find the maximum value of $g(x)$, we compute its derivative with respect to $x$ using the quotient rule:\n$$ g'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{x^3}{x^2+3}\\right) = \\frac{(3x^2)(x^2+3) - (x^3)(2x)}{(x^2+3)^2} $$\nLet's simplify the numerator:\n$$ (3x^2)(x^2+3) - (x^3)(2x) = 3x^4 + 9x^2 - 2x^4 = x^4 + 9x^2 = x^2(x^2+9) $$\nSo, the derivative is:\n$$ g'(x) = \\frac{x^2(x^2+9)}{(x^2+3)^2} $$\nFor any $x$ in the interval $[1, 5]$, the terms $x^2$, $x^2+9$, and $(x^2+3)^2$ are all positive. Therefore, $g'(x)  0$ for all $x \\in [1, 5]$.\n\nSince the derivative $g'(x)$ is strictly positive on the interval, the function $g(x)$ is strictly increasing on $[1, 5]$. For a strictly increasing function on a closed interval, the maximum value is attained at the right endpoint of the interval. In this case, the maximum occurs at $x=5$.\n\nWe evaluate $g(x)$ at $x=5$:\n$$ g(5) = \\frac{5^3}{5^2+3} = \\frac{125}{25+3} = \\frac{125}{28} $$\nThis is the maximum value of $g(x)$ on $[1, 5]$.\nTherefore, $\\|f\\|_\\infty = \\|g\\|_\\infty = \\sup_{x \\in [1,5]} |g(x)| = g(5) = \\frac{125}{28}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{125}{28}}$$", "id": "1430017"}, {"introduction": "The concept of convergence is central to the definition of a Banach space.
