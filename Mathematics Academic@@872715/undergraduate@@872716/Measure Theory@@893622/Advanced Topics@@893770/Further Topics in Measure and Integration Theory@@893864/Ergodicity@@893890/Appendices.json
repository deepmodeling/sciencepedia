A fundamental question is whether the system, over long periods, explores the entire state space in a statistically uniform way.

A transformation $T$ is said to be measure-preserving if for every subset $A \\subseteq X$, the measure of its preimage, $T^{-1}(A) = \\{x \\in X \\mid T(x) \\in A\\}$, is equal to the measure of the set itself.

A measure-preserving map $T$ is ergodic if the only $T$-invariant measurable sets $A$ (i.e., $T^{-1}(A)=A$) are $A=\\emptyset$ and $A=X$, equivalently if every invariant set has measure $0$ or $1$.\n\nFor permutations $T$ on a finite set $X$, the $T$-invariant subsets are precisely the unions of $T$-cycles (orbits). Thus, if $T$ has exactly one cycle on $X$ (i.e., acts transitively) then the only invariant sets are $\\emptyset$ and $X$. Moreover, a permutation $T$ is measure-preserving if and only if the measure is constant along each cycle, since for consecutive points $x$ and $T(x)$ in a cycle we must have $\\mu(\\{T(x)\\})=\\mu\\bigl(T^{-1}(\\{T(x)\\})\\bigr)=\\mu(\\{x\\})$.\n\nSystem I: $T_{1}$ is the $2$-cycle $s_{1}\\leftrightarrow s_{2}$, and $\\mu_{1}(\\{s_{1}\\})=\\mu_{1}(\\{s_{2}\\})=\\frac{1}{2}$.

A measure-preserving transformation $T$ on the probability space $([0, 1), \\mathcal{B}, \\lambda)$, where $\\mathcal{B}$ is the Borel sigma-algebra, is defined as ergodic if for any measurable set $A \\in \\mathcal{B}$ that is invariant under $T$ (meaning $T^{-1}(A) = A$), it must be that its measure is either $\\lambda(A) = 0$ or $\\lambda(A) = 1$. In simple terms, an ergodic system cannot be decomposed into two separate, non-trivial invariant subsystems.\n\nNow, consider the set $D$ of all dyadic rational numbers in the interval $[0, 1)$. A number is a dyadic rational if it can be written as a fraction $k/2^n$ for some non-negative integer $k$ and positive integer $n$. For any $x = k/2^n$ in $D$ (with $n > 1$), its image is $T(x) = 2(k/2^n) = k/2^{n-1}$, which is also a dyadic rational.

Therefore, the statement that the doubling map is ergodic must be incorrect.\n\nB. The set of dyadic rationals $D$ is dense in $[0,1)$, which implies its Lebesgue measure must be $\\lambda(D)=1$. An invariant set with measure 1 does not contradict ergodicity.\n\nC. Ergodicity only applies to invariant sets that are closed under the standard topology of $[0,1)$. The set $D$ is not closed, so the definition of ergodicity does not apply to it.\n\nD. The set $D$ is invariant, but its Lebesgue measure is $\\lambda(D)=0$.
