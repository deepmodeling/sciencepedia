Since $p(t)=t^2$ is a polynomial of degree 2, and $2 \\leq 3$, it is indeed in $P_3$.\n\nNow, let's verify if the sequence converges to $p(t) = t^2$ by computing the limit of the distance $d(p_n, p)$.\nThe distance is given by the integral:\n$$ d(p_n, p) = \\int_{0}^{1} |p_n(t) - p(t)| dt $$\nSubstitute the expressions for $p_n(t)$ and our candidate limit $p(t)$:\n$$ p_n(t) - p(t) = \\left(t^2 + \\frac{1}{n}t^3\\right) - t^2 = \\frac{1}{n}t^3 $$\nSo, the integral for the distance becomes:\n$$ d(p_n, p) = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left| \\frac{1}{n}t^3 \\right| dt $$\nThe integration is over the interval $t \\in [0, 1]$. In this interval, $t^3 \\ge 0$. Also, since $n$ is a positive integer, $\\frac{1}{n} > 0$. Therefore, the term $\\frac{1}{n}t^3$ is always non-negative on the interval of integration.

This is a fundamental property of the real numbers (completeness).\n\nThe Cauchy criterion for the sequence $(y_n)$ states that for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $N$ such that for all $m, n > N$, we have $|y_m - y_n| < \\epsilon$. Substituting the definition of $y_n$, this is:\n$$|\\arctan(m) - \\arctan(n)| < \\epsilon$$\nThis is precisely the condition $d(x_m, x_n) < \\epsilon$.\n\nTherefore, for any given $\\epsilon > 0$, we can find an $N$ (because the sequence $\\arctan(n)$ converges) such that for all $m, n > N$, $d(x_m, x_n) < \\epsilon$.
