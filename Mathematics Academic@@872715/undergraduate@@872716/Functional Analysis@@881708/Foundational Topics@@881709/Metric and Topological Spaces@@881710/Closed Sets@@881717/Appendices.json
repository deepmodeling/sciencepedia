The set $(-\\infty, 0]$ is closed because its complement in $\\mathbb{R}$, which is $(0, \\infty)$, is an open set. Similarly, $[1, \\infty)$ is closed because its complement, $(-\\infty, 1)$, is an open set. The finite union of closed sets is always a closed set.

The distance between them is $|x_k - x_j| = |2\\pi(k-j)| \\geq 2\\pi$. Since any two distinct points are separated by a distance of at least $2\\pi$, we can place an open interval of radius $\\pi$ around any point in $S_3$ that contains no other points from $S_3$. This means that $S_3$ has no limit points. A set that has no limit points is called a discrete set. The condition for a set to be closed is that it must contain all of its limit points. Since there are no limit points, this condition is vacuously satisfied. Thus, $S_3$ is a closed set.\n\nD. $S_4 = \\{0\\} \\cup \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{n} : n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\right\\}$.\nThe elements of this set are $S_4 = \\left\\{0, 1, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\ldots\\right\\}$.\nThe sequence of points $x_n = \\frac{1}{n}$ (for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$) are all in $S_4$. This sequence converges to 0 as $n \\to \\infty$. Thus, $0$ is a limit point of $S_4$.\nLet's check if there are other limit points. Any point $p \\neq 0$ cannot be a limit point. If $p \\in S_4$ and $p \\neq 0$, then $p = 1/k$ for some $k$. We can find an open interval around $p$ that contains no other points of $S_4$. If $p \\notin S_4$, we can also find an interval around $p$ that avoids all points of $S_4$. So, the only limit point of the set $\\left\\{ \\frac{1}{n} : n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\right\\}$ is 0.\nThe set $S_4$ is defined to include this single limit point, 0. Since $S_4$ contains all of its limit points (namely, the point 0), it is a closed set.\n\nE. $S_5 = \\mathbb{Z}$, the set of all integers.\nLet $(x_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ be a convergent sequence of points where each $x_n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Let the limit of this sequence be $L$. By the definition of convergence, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $m, n > N$, we have $|x_n - x_m|  \\epsilon$. Let's choose $\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{2}$. Then for $m, n > N$, we have $|x_n - x_m|  \\frac{1}{2}$. Since $x_n$ and $x_m$ are both integers, their difference must also be an integer. The only integer with an absolute value less than $\\frac{1}{2}$ is 0. So, $x_n - x_m = 0$, which means $x_n = x_m$ for all $m, n > N$. This shows that the sequence must be eventually constant. Let this constant value be $k$, where $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The limit of an eventually constant sequence is that constant value, so $L=k$. Since $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the limit $L$ is in $\\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, any convergent sequence of integers converges to an integer.
