This first exercise provides a concrete opportunity to apply this definition directly. By investigating a carefully constructed operator on the space of continuous functions, $C[0,1]$, you will test for both boundedness and closedness, revealing the common and important case of an operator that is closed but unbounded [@problem_id:1849304].", "problem": "Let $X = C[0,1]$ be the Banach space of all real-valued continuous functions on the interval $[0,1]$, equipped with the supremum norm $\\|f\\|_\\infty = \\sup_{x \\in [0,1]} |f(x)|$.\n\nConsider a linear operator $T$ whose domain, $D(T)$, is a subspace of $X$ defined as:\n$$D(T) = \\left\\{ f \\in C[0,1] \\mid f(0)=0 \\text{ and the limit } \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\frac{f(x)}{x} \\text{ exists} \\right\\}$$\nThe action of the operator $T: D(T) \\to X$ is defined as follows: for any function $f \\in D(T)$, the function $Tf = g$ is given by\n$$ g(x) = (Tf)(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{f(x)}{x} & \\text{if } x \\in (0,1] \\\\ \\lim_{t\\to 0^+} \\frac{f(t)}{t} & \\text{if } x = 0 \\end{cases} $$\nBased on the properties of this operator $T$, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. $T$ is a bounded linear operator.\n\nB. $T$ is a closed linear operator, but it is not bounded.\n\nC. $T$ is a bounded linear operator, but it is not closed.\n\nD. $T$ is neither closed nor bounded.\n\nE. The operator $T$ is not well-defined because $Tf$ is not guaranteed to be in $X$.", "solution": "To determine the correct statement, we need to analyze the properties of the operator $T$, specifically its boundedness and whether it is closed. The problem states that $T$ is a linear operator, which can be readily verified. For any $f_1, f_2 \\in D(T)$ and any scalar $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $(\\alpha f_1 + f_2)(0) = \\alpha f_1(0) + f_2(0) = 0$. The limit $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\frac{(\\alpha f_1 + f_2)(x)}{x} = \\alpha \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\frac{f_1(x)}{x} + \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\frac{f_2(x)}{x}$ also exists, so $\\alpha f_1 + f_2 \\in D(T)$. The linearity of the action $T(\\alpha f_1 + f_2) = \\alpha T f_1 + T f_2$ follows directly from the linearity of limits and division. The check for E can be done implicitly: the domain is defined precisely so that the limit at 0 exists, making $Tf$ continuous, so $Tf \\in C[0,1]=X$.\n\nFirst, let's test for boundedness. An operator $T$ is bounded if there exists a constant $M \\geq 0$ such that $\\|Tf\\|_\\infty \\leq M \\|f\\|_\\infty$ for all $f \\in D(T)$. To show $T$ is not bounded, we need to find a sequence of functions $(f_n)_{n=1}^\\infty$ in $D(T)$ such that the ratio $\\frac{\\|Tf_n\\|_\\infty}{\\|f_n\\|_\\infty}$ is unbounded.\n\nConsider the sequence of functions $(f_n)_{n=2}^\\infty$ defined as:\n$$ f_n(x) = \\begin{cases} nx & \\text{if } 0 \\le x \\le \\frac{1}{n} \\\\ 1 & \\text{if } \\frac{1}{n}  x \\le 1 \\end{cases} $$\nFor each $n \\ge 2$, $f_n$ is continuous on $[0,1]$. We check if $f_n \\in D(T)$.\n1. $f_n(0) = n \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n2. The limit $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\frac{f_n(x)}{x} = \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\frac{nx}{x} = n$ exists.\nSo, $f_n \\in D(T)$ for all $n \\ge 2$.\n\nNow, let's compute the norms. The maximum value of $f_n(x)$ is $1$, so $\\|f_n\\|_\\infty = 1$.\nNext, we compute $Tf_n$.\n$$ (Tf_n)(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{nx}{x} = n  \\text{if } 0  x \\le \\frac{1}{n} \\\\ \\frac{1}{x}  \\text{if } \\frac{1}{n}  x \\le 1 \\end{cases} $$\nBy definition, $(Tf_n)(0) = \\lim_{t\\to 0^+} \\frac{f_n(t)}{t} = n$.\nSo the function $Tf_n$ is continuous. To find its norm, we look for its maximum value on $[0,1]$. On the interval $(0, 1/n]$, the value is constantly $n$. On the interval $(1/n, 1]$, the function is $1/x$, which is decreasing. Its maximum value on this interval is approached as $x \\to (1/n)^+$, which is $n$. Thus, the supremum of $|(Tf_n)(x)|$ over $[0,1]$ is exactly $n$.\nSo, $\\|Tf_n\\|_\\infty = n$.\n\nThe ratio of the norms is $\\frac{\\|Tf_n\\|_\\infty}{\\|f_n\\|_\\infty} = \\frac{n}{1} = n$. Since this ratio can be arbitrarily large as $n \\to \\infty$, there is no constant $M$ that can bound it. Therefore, the operator $T$ is not bounded. This eliminates options A and C.\n\nNext, let's test if $T$ is a closed operator. An operator $T$ is closed if for every sequence $(f_n)_{n=1}^\\infty$ in its domain $D(T)$ such that $f_n \\to f$ in $X$ and $Tf_n \\to g$ in $X$ for some $f, g \\in X$, it follows that $f \\in D(T)$ and $Tf = g$.\n\nLet $(f_n) \\subset D(T)$ be a sequence such that $f_n \\to f$ and $Tf_n \\to g$ in $C[0,1]$. The convergence is in the supremum norm, which means it is uniform convergence.\n1. We need to show that $f \\in D(T)$.\n   - Since $f$ is the uniform limit of continuous functions, $f$ is continuous, i.e., $f \\in C[0,1]$.\n   - Since convergence is uniform, it is also pointwise. So, $f(0) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f_n(0)$. As each $f_n \\in D(T)$, we have $f_n(0)=0$ for all $n$. Thus, $f(0) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} 0 = 0$.\n   - Now we must show that $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\frac{f(x)}{x}$ exists. Let $g_n = Tf_n$. We are given that $g_n \\to g$ uniformly. Since each $g_n = Tf_n$ is continuous, their uniform limit $g$ is also continuous. In particular, $g$ is continuous at $x=0$, so $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} g(x) = g(0)$.\n   - For any fixed $x \\in (0,1]$, we have $(Tf_n)(x) = \\frac{f_n(x)}{x}$. Since $f_n \\to f$ and $Tf_n \\to g$ pointwise for $x>0$, we can take the limit as $n \\to \\infty$:\n     $$ g(x) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (Tf_n)(x) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{f_n(x)}{x} = \\frac{\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f_n(x)}{x} = \\frac{f(x)}{x} $$\n     This establishes the form of $g(x)$ for $x \\in (0,1]$. Now we can evaluate the limit we need:\n     $$ \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\frac{f(x)}{x} = \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} g(x) $$\n     Since $g$ is continuous on $[0,1]$, this limit exists and is equal to $g(0)$.\n   - So, $f \\in C[0,1]$, $f(0)=0$, and $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\frac{f(x)}{x}$ exists. This means $f \\in D(T)$.\n\n2. We need to show that $Tf = g$.\n   - By the definition of the operator $T$ applied to $f$, we have:\n     $$ (Tf)(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{f(x)}{x}  \\text{if } x \\in (0,1] \\\\ \\lim_{t\\to 0^+} \\frac{f(t)}{t}  \\text{if } x = 0 \\end{cases} $$\n   - From our work above, we showed that for $x \\in (0,1]$, $g(x) = \\frac{f(x)}{x}$, which matches $(Tf)(x)$.\n   - For $x=0$, we showed that $\\lim_{t\\to 0^+} \\frac{f(t)}{t} = g(0)$. This matches $(Tf)(0)$.\n   - Since $(Tf)(x) = g(x)$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$, we have $Tf = g$.\n\nBoth conditions for a closed operator are satisfied. Therefore, $T$ is a closed operator.\nCombining our findings, $T$ is closed but not bounded.
