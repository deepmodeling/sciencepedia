Let's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the operator $T$ is compact.\n\nA fundamental theorem in functional analysis, Schauder's theorem, states that a bounded linear operator on a Banach space is compact if and only if its adjoint is compact. Since $H$ is a Hilbert space (and thus a Banach space), we can apply this theorem.\n\nAccording to our assumption that $T$ is compact, Schauder's theorem implies that its Hilbert space adjoint, $T^*$, must also be a compact operator.\n\nLet's compute the adjoint of $T$. Using the properties of the adjoint operation on the space of bounded linear operators on $H$:\n$$T^* = (I + K)^*$$\nThe adjoint of a sum is the sum of the adjoints:\n$$T^* = I^* + K^*$$\nFor the identity operator on a Hilbert space, its adjoint is itself, i.e., $I^* = I$. So, we have:\n$$T^* = I + K^*$$\n\nWe are given that the operator $K$ is compact.

This means that the sum or difference of any two compact operators is also a compact operator.\n\nSince both $T^*$ and $K^*$ are compact operators, their difference, $T^* - K^*$, must also be a compact operator. Let's compute this difference:\n$$T^* - K^* = (I + K^*) - K^* = I$$\nThis calculation leads to the conclusion that the identity operator $I$ must be a compact operator.\n\nHowever, a cornerstone result in functional analysis states that the identity operator on an infinite-dimensional normed vector space is not compact. To see this, consider the image of the closed unit ball $\\overline{B_1(0)}$ under the identity operator, which is just $\\overline{B_1(0)}$ itself.

This is false.\nB. $T$ is never a compact operator. This is true, as shown by our proof.\nC. $T$ is a compact operator if and only if the norm of $K$ is less than 1. This is false. The compactness of $T$ is not dependent on the norm of $K$.\nD. $T$ is compact, but its adjoint $T^*$ is not.
