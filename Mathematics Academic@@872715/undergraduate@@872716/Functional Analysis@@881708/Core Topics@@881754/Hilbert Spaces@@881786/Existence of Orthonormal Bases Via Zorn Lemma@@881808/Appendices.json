For example, in $H = \\ell^2$ and $D$ the finitely supported sequences, the canonical orthonormal set $M$ lies in $D$ and is an orthonormal basis of $H$.\n\n- Option E is incorrect because the inner product on $D$ is the restriction of the inner product on $H$, so orthonormality is consistent between $D$ and $H$.\n\nTherefore, the correct reasoning is precisely that $M$ may fail to be maximal in $H$ because vectors orthogonal to $M$ can exist in $H \\setminus D$, which does not contradict the maximality of $M$ inside $D$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1862109"}]}
