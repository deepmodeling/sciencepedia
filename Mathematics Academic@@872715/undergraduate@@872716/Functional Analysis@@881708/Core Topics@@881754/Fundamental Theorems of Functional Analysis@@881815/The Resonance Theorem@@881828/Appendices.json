The functionals $f_n$ are not continuous on $(c_{00}, \\|\\cdot\\|_1)$.", "solution": "To determine the correct statement, we must analyze the properties of the functionals $f_n$ and relate them to the properties of the space $(c_{00}, \\|\\cdot\\|_1)$. The main tool for this is the Uniform Boundedness Principle (also known as the Banach-Steinhaus Theorem), which connects the properties of a space with the properties of families of operators defined on it.\n\nFirst, let's examine the continuity of the linear functionals $f_n$. A linear functional is continuous if and only if it is bounded. The operator norm of $f_n$ is defined as $\\|f_n\\| = \\sup_{\\|x\\|_1=1} |f_n(x)|$. For any $x = (x_k) \\in c_{00}$, we have:\n$$|f_n(x)| = |n x_n| = n |x_n|$$\nSince for any sequence $x$, the absolute value of a single term $|x_n|$ is less than or equal to the sum of the absolute values of all terms, we have $|x_n| \\le \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty |x_k| = \\|x\\|_1$.\nTherefore, we can establish an upper bound for the functional:\n$$|f_n(x)| \\le n \\|x\\|_1$$\nThis inequality shows that each functional $f_n$ is bounded, which means it is continuous. This immediately proves that statement D is false. The inequality also gives us an upper bound for the operator norm: $\\|f_n\\| \\le n$.\n\nTo find the exact operator norm, we need to find an element $x \\in c_{00}$ with $\\|x\\|_1=1$ for which $|f_n(x)|$ is maximized. Consider the sequence $e_n \\in c_{00}$ which has a 1 in the $n$-th position and 0 everywhere else. The norm of this sequence is $\\|e_n\\|_1 = |1| = 1$. Applying the functional $f_n$ to $e_n$:\n$$|f_n(e_n)| = |n \\cdot (e_n)_n| = |n \\cdot 1| = n$$\nSince $\\|f_n\\| = \\sup_{\\|x\\|_1=1} |f_n(x)|$, and we found a specific vector $e_n$ for which $|f_n(e_n)| = n$, we must have $\\|f_n\\| \\ge n$. Combining this with our earlier finding $\\|f_n\\| \\le n$, we conclude that the operator norm is exactly:\n$$\\|f_n\\| = n$$\n\nNow, consider the set of these operator norms: $\\{\\|f_n\\|\\}_{n=1}^\\infty = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$. This set is clearly not uniformly bounded, as $\\sup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\|f_n\\| = \\sup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} n = \\infty$. This fact contradicts the second part of statement A, so statement A is false.\n\nNext, let's check for pointwise boundedness. We need to determine if for every *fixed* vector $x \\in c_{00}$, the set of real numbers $\\{|f_n(x)| : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ is bounded.\nLet $x = (x_k)_{k=1}^\\infty$ be an arbitrary element of $c_{00}$. By the definition of $c_{00}$, $x$ has only a finite number of non-zero terms. This means there exists an integer $N_x$ such that for all $n  N_x$, the term $x_n = 0$.\nNow consider the set of values $\\{|f_n(x)|\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$:\n$$|f_n(x)| = |n x_n|$$\nFor $n  N_x$, we have $x_n = 0$, so $|f_n(x)| = |n \\cdot 0| = 0$.\nFor $1 \\le n \\le N_x$, the values $|f_n(x)|$ are $|1 \\cdot x_1|, |2 \\cdot x_2|, \\ldots, |N_x \\cdot x_{N_x}|$. This is a finite set of real numbers, and thus it has a maximum value.\nThe supremum of the set $\\{|f_n(x)| : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ is therefore $\\sup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} |n x_n| = \\max_{1 \\le n \\le N_x} |n x_n|$, which is a finite number.\nSince for any arbitrary $x \\in c_{00}$, a finite upper bound exists for the set $\\{|f_n(x)|\\}$, the family of functionals $\\{f_n\\}$ is pointwise bounded on $c_{00}$. This proves that statement B is false.\n\nSo far, we have established two key facts:\n1. The family of functionals $\\{f_n\\}$ is pointwise bounded on $c_{00}$.\n2. The set of operator norms $\\{\\|f_n\\|\\}$ is not uniformly bounded.\n\nThe Uniform Boundedness Principle states that if $X$ is a Banach space (a complete normed vector space) and $\\mathcal{F}$ is a collection of continuous linear operators from $X$ to a normed space $Y$, then if $\\mathcal{F}$ is pointwise bounded, it must also be uniformly bounded (i.e., the operator norms are bounded).\n\nLet's apply the contrapositive of this theorem. Assume, for the sake of argument, that $(c_{00}, \\|\\cdot\\|_1)$ is a Banach space. Then, since the family of continuous linear functionals $\\{f_n\\}$ is pointwise bounded on $c_{00}$, the Uniform Boundedness Principle would require the set of their norms, $\\{\\|f_n\\|\\}$, to be uniformly bounded. However, we have explicitly shown that $\\{\\|f_n\\|\\} = \\{n\\}$ is not a bounded set. This is a contradiction.\n\nThe contradiction arises from the assumption that $(c_{00}, \\|\\cdot\\|_1)$ is a Banach space. Therefore, this assumption must be false. The space $(c_{00}, \\|\\cdot\\|_1)$ is not complete, and thus not a Banach space.\n\nThis line of reasoning perfectly matches statement C: the family is pointwise bounded, the norms are not uniformly bounded, and this combination implies that the space is not a Banach space.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1899494"}, {"introduction": "The statement of the Resonance Theorem hinges on the crucial condition of pointwise boundedness, which must hold for *every* vector in the space.
