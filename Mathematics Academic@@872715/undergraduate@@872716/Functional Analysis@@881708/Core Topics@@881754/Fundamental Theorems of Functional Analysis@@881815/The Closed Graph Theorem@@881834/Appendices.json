The graph is not closed. This is demonstrated by the sequence of polynomials $p_n(x) = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}$ for $n \\ge 1$.

For any sequence of polynomials $(p_n)$ that converges uniformly to a polynomial $p \\in X$, and whose derivatives $(Dp_n)$ also converge uniformly to a polynomial $q \\in X$, a fundamental theorem of real analysis ensures that the derivative of the limit function is the limit of the derivative functions.

This does not produce a convergent sequence $(p_{n},p_{n}')$ in $X \\times X$, hence it does not show failure of closedness.\n\n- Option B is invalid because the limit $(\\exp(x),\\exp(x))$ lies in $C([0,1]) \\times C([0,1])$ but not in $X \\times X$. The fact that $(p_{n},p_{n}')$ converges in a larger ambient space to an element outside $X \\times X$ does not imply non-closedness of $\\Gamma(D)$ within $X \\times X$; in $X \\times X$ the sequence has no limit.\n\n- Option D is invalid because $X$ is infinite-dimensional, so the finite-dimensional closedness argument does not apply.\n\n- Option E is invalid because, although $D$ is indeed unbounded on $(X,\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\infty})$ (e.g., $\\|x^{n}\\|_{\\infty} = 1$ while $\\|(x^{n})'\\|_{\\infty} = n$), the Closed Graph Theorem cannot be invoked here since $X$ is not a Banach space.
