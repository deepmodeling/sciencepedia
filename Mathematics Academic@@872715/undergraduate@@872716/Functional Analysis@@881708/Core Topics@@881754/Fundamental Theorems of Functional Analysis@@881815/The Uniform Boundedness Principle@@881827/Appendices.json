The field is described by a continuous function $f(t)$ over a normalized time interval $[0, 1]$.

The length of this window, $t_n = 1/a^n$, decreases exponentially with the mode number $n$, where $a  1$ is a constant related to the material's damping properties. The measurement sensitivity in the $n$-th mode increases exponentially, given by a factor $K^n$, where $K  1$ is an amplification constant.\n\nThe full model for the response in mode $n$ is thus a linear functional $R_n$ acting on the input field $f$.
