This first exercise provides a clear and direct illustration of this principle by examining a rank-one operator, one of the simplest building blocks for more complex matrices. By calculating the single non-zero eigenvalue of a matrix formed by an outer product, you will gain a concrete intuition for how the fundamental components of an operator dictate its behavior.
