Every closed subspace of the non-reflexive space $\\ell^1$ is also non-reflexive.**\nThis statement is false. A finite-dimensional subspace of any normed space is always a closed set. The problem states a known fact that such a subspace $M$ is reflexive. Therefore, $M$ is a closed, reflexive subspace of the non-reflexive space $\\ell^1$. This provides a direct counterexample to the statement in option A.\n\n**B. By the Hahn-Banach theorem, every functional on $M$ can be extended...it follows that $M^* \\cong \\ell^\\infty$...**\nThe Hahn-Banach theorem indeed guarantees that every continuous linear functional on the subspace $M$ can be extended to a continuous linear functional on the entire space $\\ell^1$. However, the conclusion drawn from this is incorrect. Since $M$ is a finite-dimensional space, let's say $\\dim(M) = n$, its dual space $M^*$ is also finite-dimensional with $\\dim(M^*) = n$. The space $\\ell^\\infty$ (the space of all bounded sequences) is infinite-dimensional. An isomorphism can only exist between spaces of the same dimension. Therefore, $M^*$ cannot be isomorphic to $\\ell^\\infty$. The reasoning in this option is fundamentally flawed.\n\n**C. The canonical embedding $J: M \\to M^{**}$ is an isometry. For any finite-dimensional normed space, the dimension of the space, its dual, and its bidual are all equal. An injective linear map between two vector spaces of the same finite dimension is necessarily surjective.**\nThis option presents the standard, direct proof that any finite-dimensional normed space is reflexive. Let's verify each part.\n1.  The canonical embedding $J: M \\to M^{**}$ is an isometry. This is a direct consequence of the Hahn-Banach theorem. For any non-zero $x \\in M$, the theorem guarantees the existence of a functional $f \\in M^*$ with $\\|f\\|_{M^*} = 1$ such that $f(x) = \\|x\\|_M$. The norm of $J(x)$ in $M^{**}$ is $\\|J(x)\\|_{M^{**}} = \\sup_{g \\in M^*, \\|g\\|_{M^*} = 1} |(J(x))(g)| = \\sup_{g \\in M^*, \\|g\\|_{M^*} = 1} |g(x)|$. Since $|g(x)| \\le \\|g\\|_{M^*} \\|x\\|_M = \\|x\\|_M$ for any such $g$, and we found an $f$ for which equality holds, we have $\\|J(x)\\|_{M^{**}} = \\|x\\|_M$. This means $J$ is an isometry. An isometry is always injective.\n2.  If $\\dim(M) = n$ is finite, then its dual space $M^*$ is also finite-dimensional with $\\dim(M^*) = n$. Consequently, the bidual space $M^{**} = (M^*)^*$ also has dimension $n$. Thus, $\\dim(M) = \\dim(M^{**}) = n$.\n3.  We have established that $J: M \\to M^{**}$ is an injective linear map between two vector spaces of the same finite dimension $n$. A key theorem in linear algebra states that such a map must be a bijection (i.e., it must also be surjective).\nSince $J$ is surjective, the space $M$ is reflexive by definition. This line of reasoning is correct, complete, and provides the most fundamental explanation.\n\n**D. As a finite-dimensional subspace...Every separable Banach space is reflexive...**\nThe first part of the statement is correct: any finite-dimensional subspace of a normed space is complete, and therefore it is a Banach space. It is also separable (it has a countable dense subset). However, the crucial claim that \"Every separable Banach space is reflexive\" is false. A major counterexample is the space $\\ell^1$ itself, which is separable but not reflexive. Thus, this reasoning is invalid.\n\n**E. Every finite-dimensional subspace...is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$...Since $\\mathbb{R}^n$...is a Hilbert space, it is reflexive...**\nThis line of reasoning is also correct, but less direct than C. Let $n = \\dim(M)$. As a real $n$-dimensional vector space, $M$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Furthermore, since all norms on a finite-dimensional space are equivalent, $M$ is complete and is topologically isomorphic (homeomorphic) to $\\mathbb{R}^n$. One can equip $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with the standard inner product, making it a Hilbert space. Every Hilbert space is reflexive (a result following from the Riesz Representation Theorem). Since reflexivity is a property that is preserved under isometric isomorphisms, and $M$ is isometrically isomorphic to a reflexive space, $M$ must also be reflexive.\nWhile this argument is valid, it relies on introducing an external structure (the inner product on $\\mathbb{R}^n$) and a specific theorem for a class of spaces (Riesz theorem for Hilbert spaces). Option C is more fundamental and general, as it uses only the basic properties of dimension and duality that apply to any finite-dimensional normed space, without needing to invoke the machinery of Hilbert spaces. Therefore, C provides the more direct and crucial reason.\n\nComparing all options, C provides the most direct, general, and self-contained proof based on the core definitions of reflexivity and properties of finite-dimensional spaces.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1871059"}, {"introduction": "Abstract properties like non-reflexivity have tangible consequences for the behavior of sequences within a space.
