Because $U$ depends only on $(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},a_{4})$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{6}a_{i}=3$, the allowable counts among the first four are $k\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$. For each subset $S\\subset\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ with $1\\leq |S|\\leq 3$, $U(S)=\\sum_{i\\in S}w_{i}-c$ with weights $w_{1}=\\tfrac{23}{15}$, $w_{2}=\\tfrac{4}{3}$, $w_{3}=\\tfrac{1}{3}$, $w_{4}=1$, and $c=\\tfrac{21}{10}$. The values (with multiplicities across all 20 assignments) are:\n- For $|S|=1$: $-\\tfrac{17}{30}$, $-\\tfrac{23}{30}$, $-\\tfrac{53}{30}$, $-\\tfrac{33}{30}$ (each count $1$).\n- For $|S|=2$: $\\tfrac{23}{30}$, $-\\tfrac{7}{30}$, $\\tfrac{13}{30}$, $-\\tfrac{13}{30}$, $\\tfrac{7}{30}$, $-\\tfrac{23}{30}$ (each count $2$).\n- For $|S|=3$: $\\tfrac{33}{30}$, $\\tfrac{53}{30}$, $\\tfrac{23}{30}$, $\\tfrac{17}{30}$ (each count $1$).\n\nCollecting, the full multiset of $U$ has counts: $\\tfrac{53}{30}(1)$, $\\tfrac{33}{30}(1)$, $\\tfrac{23}{30}(3)$, $\\tfrac{17}{30}(1)$, $\\tfrac{13}{30}(2)$, $\\tfrac{7}{30}(2)$, $-\\tfrac{7}{30}(2)$, $-\\tfrac{13}{30}(2)$, $-\\tfrac{17}{30}(1)$, $-\\tfrac{23}{30}(3)$, $-\\tfrac{33}{30}(1)$, $-\\tfrac{53}{30}(1)$.\n\nWith $|U_{\\text{obs}}|=\\tfrac{13}{30}$, the two-sided p-value is the proportion with $|U|\\geq \\tfrac{13}{30}$. The only values with $|U|\\tfrac{13}{30}$ are $\\pm\\tfrac{7}{30}$ (total count $4$). Hence the p-value is\n$$\np=\\frac{20-4}{20}=\\frac{16}{20}=0.8.\n$$\n\nRounded to four significant figures, the p-value is $0.8000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8000}$$", "id": "1962134"}]}
