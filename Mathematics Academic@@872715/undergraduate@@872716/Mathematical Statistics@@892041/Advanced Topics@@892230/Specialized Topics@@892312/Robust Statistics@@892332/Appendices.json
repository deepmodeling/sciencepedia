The professor suspects that the traditional arithmetic mean of the scores is being skewed by a few exceptionally low scores from students who did not prepare, as well as a few exceptionally high scores from students with prior professional experience. To get a more robust measure of the class's central tendency, the professor decides to compute a Winsorized mean.\n\nThe Winsorized mean is a robust statistical measure of central tendency. A $p\\%$ Winsorized mean is calculated as follows: First, sort the data from smallest to largest. Let $n$ be the number of data points. Calculate the number of points to be adjusted on each end of the distribution, $k$, which is the largest integer less than or equal to $n \\times (p/100)$. The $k$ smallest data points are then replaced by the $(k+1)$-th smallest data point. Similarly, the $k$ largest data points are replaced by the $(k+1)$-th largest data point (which is also the $(n-k)$-th data point in the sorted list). The arithmetic mean of this newly formed dataset is the Winsorized mean.\n\nGiven the following fifteen exam scores (out of 100):\n$$ \\{ 70, 62, 99, 58, 78, 12, 65, 81, 71, 25, 68, 98, 73, 31, 75 \\} $$\n\nCalculate the 20% Winsorized mean of these scores.
