This first exercise provides a direct opportunity to practice classifying the three core mechanisms: Missing Completely At Random (MCAR), Missing At Random (MAR), and Missing Not At Random (MNAR). By analyzing three distinct, plausible scenarios from a health app, you will learn to distinguish the subtle but critical differences between them, a fundamental skill for any data analyst [@problem_id:1936102].", "problem": "A team of data scientists is analyzing data from a new health application designed to monitor nightly sleep quality. The primary variable of interest, which we will call `SleepScore`, is a continuous value from 0 (very poor) to 100 (excellent). However, they notice that for a significant number of nights, the `SleepScore` value is missing. They are tasked with identifying the likely missing data mechanism for three distinct situations they've identified from user reports and internal logs.\n\nThe three primary mechanisms for missing data are:\n-   **Missing Completely At Random (MCAR):** The probability that a value is missing is unrelated to any observed or unobserved variables.\n-   **Missing At Random (MAR):** The probability that a value is missing depends only on other observed variables, but not on the unobserved value of the variable itself.\n-   **Missing Not At Random (MNAR):** The probability that a value is missing depends on the unobserved value of the variable itself.\n\nBelow are the three scenarios the team is investigating.\n\n**Scenario 1:** For one week, a software bug caused the application to fail to transmit its data to the central server if the phone's battery level, which is recorded, was below 20% at the end of the sleep session. After analyzing the complete data, the team found no correlation between the phone's end-of-night battery level and the user's actual `SleepScore`.\n\n**Scenario 2:** The app uses a sensitive microphone to detect snoring and breathing patterns. In a rare \"data-overload\" error, the app crashes and fails to save any `SleepScore` data if it detects extremely loud and persistent snoring throughout the night. The intensity of snoring is a primary component used to calculate the `SleepScore`.\n\n**Scenario 3:** A random sample of user records was permanently deleted from the database due to a server hardware malfunction that affected arbitrary sectors of a hard drive.\n\nIdentify the correct missing data mechanism for each scenario.\n\nA.

The standard definitions are:\n$$\n\\text{MCAR: } P(R=0 \\mid Y,X)=P(R=0), \\quad\n\\text{MAR: } P(R=0 \\mid Y,X)=P(R=0 \\mid X), \\quad\n\\text{MNAR: } P(R=0 \\mid Y,X) \\text{ depends on } Y \\text{ given } X.\n$$\n\nScenario 1: The transmission fails when the observed battery level $B$ is below a threshold. Thus the missingness depends on an observed variable $B$, not on $Y$, so\n$$\nP(R=0 \\mid Y,B)=P(R=0 \\mid B),\n$$\nwhich is MAR. The note that $B$ is uncorrelated with $Y$ does not convert the mechanism to MCAR, because MCAR requires $P(R=0 \\mid Y,X)$ to be constant and here it varies with $B$.\n\nScenario 2: The app crashes under extremely loud and persistent snoring, which is a primary component in computing $Y$. Hence, even after conditioning on any observed $X$, the probability of missingness depends on the (unobserved) value of $Y$. Formally,\n$$\nP(R=0 \\mid Y,X) \\text{ varies with } Y,\n$$\nso the mechanism is MNAR.\n\nScenario 3: A random sample of records was deleted due to arbitrary hardware sector failure. This implies the deletion is independent of both $Y$ and $X$:\n$$\nP(R=0 \\mid Y,X)=P(R=0),\n$$\nwhich is MCAR.\n\nTherefore, the correct identification is: Scenario 1 is MAR, Scenario 2 is MNAR, Scenario 3 is MCAR, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1936102"}, {"introduction": "The 'Missing At Random' (MAR) mechanism is arguably the most important in practice, as many statistical methods are valid under this assumption. This practice problem presents a classic MAR scenario involving wildlife camera traps, where data loss is tied to an observed variable—temperature. Working through this example will solidify your understanding of how missingness can be dependent on other data you *do* have, but still be considered 'random' in a statistical sense [@problem_id:1936096].", "problem": "A team of wildlife biologists is studying the activity patterns of a rare species in a remote, cold environment. They deploy a network of motion-activated camera traps. For each hour, the system is designed to record two variables: `animal_sighting`, a binary variable which is 1 if the target species is detected and 0 otherwise, and `ambient_temperature`, the temperature in degrees Celsius.\n\nThe camera traps are powered by batteries whose performance degrades significantly in cold weather. The data acquisition system has two components: a robust, independently-powered sensor that logs the `ambient_temperature` every hour without fail, and the camera system itself which records the `animal_sighting`.\n\nUpon analyzing the collected data, the biologists observe that there are numerous hours for which the `ambient_temperature` is recorded, but the `animal_sighting` value is missing. They determine that these missing data points for `animal_sighting` occur because the camera system temporarily shut down due to its battery draining too quickly in the low temperatures. The probability of the camera shutting down and failing to record an `animal_sighting` is directly related to the value of `ambient_temperature`, but is not dependent on whether an animal was actually in front of the camera at that moment.\n\nGiven this scenario, identify the correct classification for the missing data mechanism for the `animal_sighting` variable.\n\nThe standard classifications are:\n- Missing Completely at Random (MCAR): The probability of a value being missing is unrelated to any other measured variable and is also unrelated to the value of the variable itself.\n- Missing at Random (MAR): The probability of a value being missing is related to some other measured variable in the dataset, but not to the unobserved value of the variable itself.\n- Missing Not at Random (MNAR): The probability of a value being missing is related to the unobserved value of the variable itself.\n\nWhich of the following best describes the missing data mechanism?\n\nA.

This implies that the probability of missingness depends on $X$ and not on $Y$. Formally, the given information implies\n$$\n\\Pr(R=0 \\mid Y, X) = \\Pr(R=0 \\mid X),\n$$\nwith $X$ fully observed for all hours.\n\nCompare this to the standard definitions:\n1. MCAR requires\n$$\n\\Pr(R=0 \\mid Y, X) = \\Pr(R=0),\n$$\nwhich is violated here because the probability of camera shutdown depends on $X$ (temperature), so it is not constant.\n\n2. MAR requires\n$$\n\\Pr(R=0 \\mid Y, X) = \\Pr(R=0 \\mid X),\n$$\nwhich is exactly satisfied by the described mechanism since missingness is a function of $X$ only, and $X$ is fully observed.\n\n3. MNAR would require dependence on the unobserved value of $Y$ even after conditioning on observed variables, i.e., $\\Pr(R=0 \\mid Y, X)$ depends on $Y$ after conditioning on $X$. The problem states the missingness is not dependent on whether an animal was present, so this is not the case.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification is Missing at Random (MAR). The option labeled Structural Deficit Missingness is not one of the standard Rubin classifications and does not apply here since the missingness arises stochastically via low temperatures rather than by design-imposed structural absence of values.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1936096"}, {"introduction": "In advanced statistical analysis, we must move beyond intuitive labels and define our assumptions with mathematical precision. This final challenge asks you to do just that by analyzing a formal model of patient dropout in a clinical trial. You will determine the exact conditions on the model's parameters that ensure the data is Missing At Random (MAR), revealing the deep connection between the conceptual definitions of missingness and the mathematical structure of a statistical model [@problem_id:1936118].", "problem": "In a clinical study designed to test a new drug, researchers encounter patient dropouts, leading to missing outcome data. They propose a statistical model to understand this phenomenon. For each patient, the model includes:\n- An outcome variable $Y$, representing the patient's response to the drug.\n- A binary covariate $X \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, indicating which of two clinics the patient belongs to.\n- An unobserved binary latent class $Z \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, representing an intrinsic patient type (e.g., genetic predisposition to respond well or poorly to the drug).\n- A response indicator $R \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, where $R=1$ if the outcome $Y$ is observed, and $R=0$ if the patient drops out and $Y$ is missing.\n\nThe model is defined by the following set of assumptions:\n1.  The latent class $Z$ follows a Bernoulli distribution, $P(Z=1) = \\pi_z$, with $0 < \\pi_z < 1$.\n2.  The clinic covariate $X$ follows a Bernoulli distribution, $P(X=1) = \\pi_x$, with $0 < \\pi_x < 1$. The variables $X$ and $Z$ are statistically independent.\n3.  The patient's outcome $Y$, conditional on their latent class $Z=z$, follows a normal distribution with mean $\\mu_z$ and a constant variance $\\sigma^2 > 0$. The outcome $Y$ is assumed to be conditionally independent of the clinic $X$ given the latent class $Z$.\n4.  The probability of observing the outcome $Y$ (i.e., $R=1$) depends on both the clinic $X$ and the latent class $Z$ through the logistic regression model:\n    $$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{P(R=1 | X=x, Z=z)}{1 - P(R=1 | X=x, Z=z)}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_x x + \\beta_z z $$\n    where $\\beta_0, \\beta_x, \\beta_z$ are finite real-valued parameters. The response $R$ is conditionally independent of the outcome $Y$ given $X$ and $Z$.\n\nIn the analysis of missing data, a key concept is whether the data are Missing At Random (MAR). The MAR assumption holds if the probability of a value being missing depends only on the observed information. In the context of this problem, the missing data mechanism is MAR if and only if the conditional probability of response $P(R=1 | Y, X)$ does not depend on the value of the (potentially missing) outcome $Y$.\n\nWhich of the following conditions on the model parameters is both necessary and sufficient for the missing data mechanism to be Missing at Random (MAR)?\n\nA. $\\beta_x = 0$\n\nB. $\\beta_z = 0$\n\nC. $\\mu_0 = \\mu_1$\n\nD. $\\beta_x = 0$ or $\\mu_0 = \\mu_1$\n\nE. $\\beta_z = 0$ or $\\mu_0 = \\mu_1$\n\nF. $\\beta_x = 0$ and $\\mu_0 = \\mu_1$\n\nG. $\\beta_z = 0$ and $\\mu_0 = \\mu_1$\n\nH.
