The experiment has a time limit: each student is given a maximum of 15.0 minutes to work on the puzzle. If a student does not solve the puzzle within this time, their attempt is stopped, and their solution time is recorded as being greater than 15.0 minutes. This is a case of right-censoring.\n\nIn one session, ten students participated. The recorded times for the five students who successfully completed the puzzle were 5.2, 8.7, 10.1, 12.5, and 14.8 minutes.

The lifetime $T$ of an LED, defined as the time until it fails, is modeled as a random variable following an exponential distribution with an unknown, constant failure rate parameter $\\lambda  0$.\n\nFor each LED under test, there is a critical safety protocol. The test for a specific unit is immediately terminated if its internal operating temperature crosses a predefined safety threshold. This censoring event is caused by random factors such as microscopic imperfections or fluctuations in the cooling system. The time $C$ at which a unit's test is terminated due to this temperature limit is also modeled as a random variable. Based on historical data from similar components, $C$ is assumed to follow an exponential distribution with a rate parameter $\\mu  0$. The lifetime $T$ and the censoring time $C$ are assumed to be independent random variables.\n\nAn experiment is conducted on a batch of $N$ identical LEDs. For each LED $i$ (where $i=1, 2, \\ldots, N$), the experiment records the observed time $y_i$ and a status indicator $\\delta_i$. The time $y_i$ is the time of failure or the time of censoring, whichever comes first.
