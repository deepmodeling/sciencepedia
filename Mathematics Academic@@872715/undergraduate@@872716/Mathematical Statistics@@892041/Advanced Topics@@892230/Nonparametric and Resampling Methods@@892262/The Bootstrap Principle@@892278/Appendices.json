The percentile bootstrap method, in particular, is beautifully intuitive: it uses the distribution of statistics from resampled data to directly estimate the range where the true parameter likely lies. This first exercise [@problem_id:1959396] walks you through interpreting the results of a bootstrap simulation to build a confidence interval for a population proportion, a fundamental task in fields like quality control and survey analysis.", "problem": "A quality control engineer at a semiconductor fabrication plant is tasked with assessing the reliability of a new type of processor. A random sample of $n=200$ processors is drawn from a large production batch and subjected to an aggressive stress test. In this sample, $x=24$ processors fail the test. The engineer wants to construct a confidence interval for the true, unknown proportion, $p$, of processors in the entire batch that would fail this test.\n\nTo accomplish this, the engineer uses a computational method. First, a large number of 'bootstrap samples' are generated. Each bootstrap sample is of size $n=200$, and is created by drawing processors *with replacement* from the original sample of 200. For each bootstrap sample, the proportion of failed processors, let's call it $\\hat{p}^*$, is calculated. This process is repeated $B = 2000$ times, yielding 2000 bootstrap proportions: $\\hat{p}^*_1, \\hat{p}^*_2, \\dots, \\hat{p}^*_{2000}$.\n\nThese 2000 proportions are then sorted in ascending order, denoted $\\hat{p}^*_{(1)} \\le \\hat{p}^*_{(2)} \\le \\dots \\le \\hat{p}^*_{(2000)}$. The engineer records the values near the key percentiles needed to construct a 95% confidence interval. The recorded values from the sorted list are:\n- 49th value: $\\hat{p}^*_{(49)} = 0.075$\n- 50th value: $\\hat{p}^*_{(50)} = 0.080$\n- 51st value: $\\hat{p}^*_{(51)} = 0.080$\n- ...\n- 1949th value: $\\hat{p}^*_{(1949)} = 0.160$\n- 1950th value: $\\hat{p}^*_{(1950)} = 0.165$\n- 1951st value: $\\hat{p}^*_{(1951)} = 0.165$\n\nUsing this information, determine the 95% percentile bootstrap confidence interval for the true failure proportion $p$.

To construct a $(1-\\alpha) \\times 100\\%$ confidence interval, we need to find the lower and upper bounds from the sorted distribution of bootstrap statistics. The lower bound is the $(\\alpha/2)$ quantile and the upper bound is the $(1-\\alpha/2)$ quantile of the bootstrap distribution.\n\nFor a 95% confidence interval, we have $1-\\alpha = 0.95$, which implies $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\nThe lower bound of the confidence interval corresponds to the quantile at $\\alpha/2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha}{2} = \\frac{0.05}{2} = 0.025\n$$\n\nThe upper bound of the confidence interval corresponds to the quantile at $1 - \\alpha/2$:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} = 1 - 0.025 = 0.975\n$$\n\nWe have $B = 2000$ bootstrap samples, which have been used to calculate 2000 bootstrap proportions, $\\hat{p}^*$.
