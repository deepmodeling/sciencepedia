Instead, they closely follow a continuous uniform distribution, $U(\\mu - w, \\mu + w)$, where $\\mu$ is the mean component length and $w$ is a positive constant defining the tolerance range. Although the distributions are non-normal, the null hypothesis of equal variances across the lines is believed to be true.\n\nFor large samples from non-normal distributions, the asymptotic distribution of the Bartlett statistic under the null hypothesis is modified.
