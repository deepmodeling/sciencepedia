A naive interpretation is to conclude that all the null hypotheses are true, but this represents a major statistical fallacy. This problem challenges you to think critically about the inherent trade-offs of the Bonferroni method, specifically its effect on statistical power and the corresponding increase in the risk of Type II errors (false negatives) [@problem_id:1901522]. Mastering this concept is essential for accurately interpreting and reporting null findings in any study involving multiple comparisons.", "problem": "A team of pharmacologists is screening a library of 20 new chemical compounds to identify potential candidates for reducing blood pressure. For each compound, they conduct a separate clinical trial. In each trial, the null hypothesis, $H_0$, is that the compound has no effect on mean systolic blood pressure, while the alternative hypothesis, $H_a$, is that it does have an effect. The team wants to control the family-wise error rate (FWER) — the probability of making at least one Type I error across all 20 tests — at a significance level of $\\alpha_{\\text{FWER}} = 0.05$. To do this, they apply the Bonferroni correction to adjust the significance level for each individual test.\n\nAfter analyzing the results from all 20 trials, they find that none of the compounds produced a p-value low enough to be considered statistically significant at the new, corrected threshold. In their summary report, the lead pharmacologist writes, \"Our comprehensive screening has demonstrated that none of the 20 candidate compounds are effective at reducing blood pressure.\"\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate critique of the pharmacologist's conclusion?\n\nA. The conclusion is flawed because the Bonferroni correction is too liberal; it increases the overall probability of a Type I error, meaning a truly ineffective compound was likely flagged as effective.\n\nB. The conclusion is flawed because the assumption of independence between the tests is likely violated, invalidating the use of the Bonferroni correction.\n\nC. The conclusion is fundamentally sound. The goal of the Bonferroni correction is to prevent false positives, and since none were found, it is correct to conclude that all null hypotheses are true.\n\nD. The conclusion is an overstatement. Failing to reject a null hypothesis does not prove it is true. This is particularly problematic here because the Bonferroni correction, being highly conservative, significantly increases the probability of making a Type II error (failing to detect a real effect), thereby reducing the statistical power of each individual test.\n\nE. The conclusion is based on a procedural error. The team should have used a less stringent correction method, like the Holm-Bonferroni method, which would have guaranteed at least one significant finding.", "solution": "Let $m=20$ denote the number of hypothesis tests. The family-wise error rate (FWER) is defined as $P(V \\ge 1)$, where $V$ is the number of Type I errors among the $m$ tests. The Bonferroni correction sets the per-test significance level to $\\alpha_{\\text{ind}}=\\alpha_{\\text{FWER}}/m$ and guarantees control of the FWER via the union bound (Boole’s inequality), which does not require any independence assumption:\n$$\n\\text{FWER}=P\\!\\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^{m}\\{\\text{Type I error in test }i\\}\\right)\\le \\sum_{i=1}^{m}P(\\text{Type I error in test }i)=m\\alpha_{\\text{ind}}=\\alpha_{\\text{FWER}}.\n$$\nTherefore, statement B is incorrect because Bonferroni control does not rely on independence. Statement A is incorrect because the Bonferroni procedure is conservative; it does not increase the Type I error rate, but rather controls it at or below $\\alpha_{\\text{FWER}}$.\n\nNow consider the interpretation of the results. For each test, using a smaller per-test level $\\alpha_{\\text{ind}}$ makes the rejection region smaller, which increases the probability of a Type II error and thus decreases statistical power for any given nonzero effect size. Hence, even if some compounds truly reduce blood pressure, the reduced power under Bonferroni makes it more likely that the tests fail to reject the corresponding null hypotheses. Consequently, failing to reject $H_{0}$ for all compounds does not logically imply that all $H_{0}$ are true; it only indicates that the data did not provide sufficient evidence to reject at the chosen, highly conservative threshold. Therefore, statement C is incorrect because non-significance is not proof of no effect.\n\nFinally, although procedures like the Holm–Bonferroni method are uniformly more powerful than the simple Bonferroni correction while still controlling the FWER, they do not guarantee any rejections; thus statement E is incorrect.\n\nThe most accurate critique is that the conclusion overstates what the results support: non-rejection does not prove the nulls, and the Bonferroni correction’s conservativeness exacerbates the risk of Type II errors, reducing power.
