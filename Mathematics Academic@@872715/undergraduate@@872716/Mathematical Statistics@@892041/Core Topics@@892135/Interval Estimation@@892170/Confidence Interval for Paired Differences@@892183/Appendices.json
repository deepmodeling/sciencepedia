This is a paired data problem, as we have two measurements (before and after) on the same set of subjects (rose bushes).\n\nFirst, we define the parameter of interest. Let $\\mu_d = \\mu_{After} - \\mu_{Before}$ be the true mean difference in the number of blooms. We want to find a confidence interval for $\\mu_d$.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the difference, $d_i = \\text{After}_i - \\text{Before}_i$, for each of the $n=9$ bushes.\nThe data pairs (Before, After) are: (12, 18), (15, 19), (9, 15), (21, 25), (18, 22), (14, 23), (10, 12), (17, 26), (13, 19).\nThe calculated differences are:\n$d_1 = 18 - 12 = 6$\n$d_2 = 19 - 15 = 4$\n$d_3 = 15 - 9 = 6$\n$d_4 = 25 - 21 = 4$\n$d_5 = 22 - 18 = 4$\n$d_6 = 23 - 14 = 9$\n$d_7 = 12 - 10 = 2$\n$d_8 = 26 - 17 = 9$\n$d_9 = 19 - 13 = 6$\nThe set of differences is $d = \\{6, 4, 6, 4, 4, 9, 2, 9, 6\\}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the sample mean of these differences, $\\bar{d}$.\n$$ \\bar{d} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i}{n} = \\frac{6+4+6+4+4+9+2+9+6}{9} = \\frac{50}{9} \\approx 5.5556 $$\n\nNow, we calculate the sample standard deviation of the differences, $s_d$. The formula for the sample variance $s_d^2$ is:\n$$ s_d^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (d_i - \\bar{d})^2}{n-1} = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i^2 - \\frac{(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i)^2}{n} \\right) $$\nFirst, we find $\\sum d_i^2$:\n$$ \\sum d_i^2 = 6^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 + 4^2 + 4^2 + 9^2 + 2^2 + 9^2 + 6^2 = 36 + 16 + 36 + 16 + 16 + 81 + 4 + 81 + 36 = 322 $$\nNow we can calculate the sample variance:\n$$ s_d^2 = \\frac{1}{9-1} \\left( 322 - \\frac{50^2}{9} \\right) = \\frac{1}{8} \\left( 322 - \\frac{2500}{9} \\right) = \\frac{1}{8} \\left( \\frac{2898 - 2500}{9} \\right) = \\frac{1}{8} \\left( \\frac{398}{9} \\right) \\approx 5.5278 $$\nThe sample standard deviation is the square root of the variance:\n$$ s_d = \\sqrt{5.5278} \\approx 2.3511 $$\n\nSince the population standard deviation of the differences is unknown and the sample size is small ($n<30$), we use the t-distribution to construct the confidence interval. The formula for the confidence interval is:\n$$ \\bar{d} \\pm t_{\\alpha/2, n-1} \\frac{s_d}{\\sqrt{n}} $$\nFor a 95% confidence interval, the significance level is $\\alpha = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$. Thus, $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$. The degrees of freedom are $df = n - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8$.\nWe need to find the critical t-value, $t_{0.025, 8}$. From a t-distribution table or a calculator, we find:\n$$ t_{0.025, 8} = 2.306 $$\n\nNow we calculate the margin of error, $E$:\n$$ E = t_{\\alpha/2, n-1} \\frac{s_d}{\\sqrt{n}} = 2.306 \\times \\frac{2.3511}{\\sqrt{9}} = 2.306 \\times \\frac{2.3511}{3} \\approx 1.8078 $$\n\nFinally, we construct the 95% confidence interval for $\\mu_d$:\n$$ (\\bar{d} - E, \\bar{d} + E) $$\nLower bound: $5.5556 - 1.8078 = 3.7478$\nUpper bound: $5.5556 + 1.8078 = 7.3634$\n\nThe problem asks to round the final answers to three significant figures.\nLower bound $\\approx 3.75$\nUpper bound $\\approx 7.36$\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the true mean increase in the number of blooms is (3.75, 7.36).
