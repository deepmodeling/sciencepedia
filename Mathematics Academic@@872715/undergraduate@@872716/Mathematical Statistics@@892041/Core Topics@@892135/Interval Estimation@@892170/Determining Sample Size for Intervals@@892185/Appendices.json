A critical component is a small gear manufactured using a novel 3D printing process. While the process is highly repeatable, there is inherent variability in the dimensions of the printed parts. Based on extensive prior data from similar printing technologies, the standard deviation of the gear's diameter is known to be $0.2$ mm.\n\nThe engineering team needs to estimate the true mean diameter of the gears produced by this new process. To ensure the robotic arm meets its performance specifications, they must be $99\\%$ confident that their estimate of the mean diameter is within $0.05$ mm of the true mean diameter.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of gears that must be printed and measured to meet this requirement?", "solution": "We are estimating a population mean with a known standard deviation $\\sigma=0.2$ mm at a confidence level of $99\\%$.
