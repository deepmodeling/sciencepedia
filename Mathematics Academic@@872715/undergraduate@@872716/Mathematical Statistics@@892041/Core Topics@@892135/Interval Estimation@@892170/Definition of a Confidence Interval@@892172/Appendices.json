A natural question arises: if we want to be more certain that our interval contains the true value, say by increasing our confidence from 95% to 99%, what is the cost? This exercise directly investigates the fundamental trade-off between the level of confidence and the precision (or width) of an interval, a crucial concept for correctly interpreting and reporting statistical results.", "problem": "A team of data scientists has collected a single, fixed random sample of data to estimate an unknown population mean, $\\mu$. They proceed to calculate two different confidence intervals for $\\mu$ using this same sample. The first interval is calculated with a 95% confidence level, and the second interval is calculated with a 99% confidence level. Both intervals are symmetric and constructed using the standard method based on the sample mean and the appropriate critical value from either the standard normal or a t-distribution.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the relationship between the calculated 99% confidence interval and the 95% confidence interval?\n\nA. The 99% confidence interval could be narrower than the 95% confidence interval, but only if the sample size is extremely large.\n\nB. The 99% confidence interval must be wider than the 95% confidence interval.\n\nC. The 99% confidence interval could be narrower than the 95% confidence interval, but only if the sample's variance is exceptionally small.\n\nD. Which interval is wider depends on the value of the sample mean.\n\nE. The 99% confidence interval must be narrower than the 95% confidence interval because a higher confidence level implies a more precise estimate.", "solution": "Let a single sample of size $n$ produce a sample mean $\\bar{X}$ and a fixed standard error $\\mathrm{SE}$. Under the standard symmetric two-sided construction at confidence level $1-\\alpha$, the confidence interval for $\\mu$ has the form\n$$\n\\bar{X} \\pm c_{1-\\alpha/2}\\,\\mathrm{SE},\n$$\nwhere $c_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the appropriate critical value from either the standard normal distribution or a $t$-distribution with fixed degrees of freedom determined by the sample. Because the same sample is used for both intervals, $\\bar{X}$ and $\\mathrm{SE}$ are identical across the two intervals, and the degrees of freedom (if using a $t$-distribution) are also the same.\n\nThe total width of the interval at level $1-\\alpha$ is\n$$\nW(1-\\alpha) \\equiv 2\\,c_{1-\\alpha/2}\\,\\mathrm{SE}.\n$$\nConsider two confidence levels $1-\\alpha_{1}$ and $1-\\alpha_{2}$ with $1-\\alpha_{2} > 1-\\alpha_{1}$ (so $\\alpha_{2}  \\alpha_{1}$). The mapping $p \\mapsto q(p)$ that sends a right-tail cumulative probability $p$ to the corresponding quantile for either the standard normal or a fixed-$\\mathrm{df}$ $t$-distribution is strictly increasing.

This conclusion does not depend on the sample size, the sample variance, or the value of the sample mean; it follows solely from the monotonicity of the critical value with respect to the confidence level and the fact that $\\mathrm{SE}$ and the reference distribution (including its degrees of freedom, if $t$) are fixed given the sample.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the $0.99$ interval must be wider than the $0.95$ interval.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1912996"}, {"introduction": "The frequentist guarantee of a confidence interval, such as 95% coverage in repeated sampling, hinges on the correctness of the underlying statistical model.
