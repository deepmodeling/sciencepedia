A cohort of 200 students is randomly divided into two equal and independent groups. Group 1 receives all lectures online, while Group 2 receives all lectures in-person. At the end of the semester, all students take the same final exam.

The key phrase here is \"related groups.\" This typically applies to:\n1.  **Paired data:** Where each data point in one group is uniquely and meaningfully paired with a data point in the other group. For example, comparing the preferences of husbands and wives.\n2.  **Repeated measures (pre-test/post-test) designs:** Where the same subjects are measured on two separate occasions, usually before and after an intervention. For example, testing the same group of patients for a condition before and after a treatment.\n\nThe data for the McNemar test is typically organized in a 2x2 contingency table that cross-classifies the outcomes for the paired subjects or repeated measurements. For a pre-test/post-test design, the table would look like this:\n\n|                 | Post-test: Pass | Post-test: Fail |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| **Pre-test: Pass**  |       a         |       b         |\n| **Pre-test: Fail**  |       c         |       d         |\n\nHere, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are counts of subjects. For instance, `b` is the number of subjects who passed the pre-test but failed the post-test, and `c` is the number of subjects who failed the pre-test but passed the post-test. The McNemar test focuses specifically on the discordant pairs, `b` and `c`, to test the null hypothesis of marginal homogeneity, which in this context means the proportion of people passing has not changed between the two time points. The test statistic is calculated as $\\chi^2 = \\frac{(b - c)^2}{b + c}$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the researcher's study design. The study involves two *independent* groups of students: Group 1 (online) and Group 2 (in-person). The students were randomly assigned to these groups, and there is no natural pairing between a student in Group 1 and a student in Group 2. The data structure would not be a 2x2 table of paired outcomes, but rather two separate frequency counts:\n\n-   **Group 1 (Online):** $n_1$ students, with $x_1$ passes and $(n_1 - x_1)$ fails.\n-   **Group 2 (In-person):** $n_2$ students, with $x_2$ passes and $(n_2 - x_2)$ fails.\n\nThe appropriate statistical test for comparing the pass proportions, $p_1 = x_1/n_1$ and $p_2 = x_2/n_2$, from two independent samples is a two-proportion z-test or a chi-squared test of independence. The McNemar test is fundamentally incorrect because its core assumption of paired or related data is violated.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n**A. The McNemar test is designed for analyzing paired nominal data, but the study design involves two independent samples.** This statement correctly identifies the fundamental mismatch between the test's requirement (paired data) and the study's design (independent samples).\n\n**B. The McNemar test is not suitable because the outcome variable (pass/fail) is binary, whereas the test requires a continuous outcome variable.** This statement is incorrect. The McNemar test is specifically designed for dichotomous (binary) nominal variables.\n\n**C. The McNemar test is invalid in this context because it assumes that the proportions in both groups follow a normal distribution.** This statement is incorrect. The McNemar test is a non-parametric test and does not make assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data, such as normality. Its test statistic, under the null hypothesis and for a sufficient sample size, is approximated by a chi-squared distribution.\n\n**D. The McNemar test is only appropriate for pre-test/post-test designs where the same group of subjects is measured twice, and cannot be used to compare two different groups.** This statement is partially correct in that pre-test/post-test designs are a common application. However, it is too restrictive. The McNemar test can also be used for other types of paired data, such as matched-pairs designs (e.g., comparing twins, or subjects matched on specific criteria). Option A is more general and precise because the core distinction is \"paired\" versus \"independent,\" which covers all use cases. The study's flaw is using independent groups, not just that it wasn't a pre-post design. Therefore, Option A provides a more fundamental and encompassing reason.\n\nBased on this analysis, option A is the best and most accurate justification for why the McNemar test is inappropriate for the researcher's study.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1933875"}, {"introduction": "After confirming that a paired-data design is in place, the next step is to calculate the test statistic to quantify the observed change.
