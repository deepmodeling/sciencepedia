{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before any calculation begins, a researcher must clearly define the question they are asking. This exercise will help you understand a crucial first step: deciding whether your hypothesis is directional (one-tailed) or non-directional (two-tailed), a choice that directly impacts the test's conclusion and its statistical power. This skill ensures your statistical analysis is properly aligned with your scientific goals [@problem_id:1917992].", "problem": "A biotechnology firm has developed a new gene therapy treatment intended to increase the expression of a beneficial protein. A clinical trial is designed to test its efficacy. Twenty patients with a diagnosed deficiency of this protein are enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group A (10 patients) receives a placebo, and Group B (10 patients) receives the new gene therapy. After a three-month period, each patient is categorized as either \"Improved\" or \"Not Improved\" based on whether their protein expression level has crossed a clinically meaningful threshold.\n\nThe research team is only interested in whether the new therapy is strictly more effective than the placebo. If the therapy is equally effective or less effective, it will be considered a failure. The team plans to analyze the resulting 2x2 contingency table of counts (Group vs. Outcome) using Fisher's exact test, which is appropriate for this experimental design with small sample sizes.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the appropriate statistical approach and its justification?\n\nA. A two-tailed Fisher's exact test should be used because the null hypothesis is that there is no association between the treatment and the outcome, and a two-tailed test is the standard method for testing this hypothesis.\n\nB. A one-tailed Fisher's exact test should be used because the scientific question is directional; the researchers are specifically investigating if the new therapy is *better* than the placebo, not just different.\n\nC. A two-tailed Fisher's exact test should be used because it provides more statistical power than a one-tailed test to detect any significant effect.\n\nD. A one-tailed Fisher's exact test should be used only if the number of patients in the 'Improved' category is greater than the number in the 'Not Improved' category across both groups combined.\n\nE. The choice between a one-tailed and a two-tailed test cannot be made until after the data is collected and a preliminary analysis is performed.", "solution": "The core of this problem lies in understanding the relationship between a research question and the formulation of statistical hypotheses, which in turn dictates the type of statistical test to be used (one-tailed vs. two-tailed).\n\nFirst, let's define the null hypothesis ($H_0$) and the alternative hypothesis ($H_A$).\nThe null hypothesis ($H_0$) is a statement of no effect or no difference. In this context, it would be that the new gene therapy has no effect, meaning the proportion of \"Improved\" patients in the therapy group is the same as in the placebo group.\nThe alternative hypothesis ($H_A$) is the statement that the researcher is trying to find evidence for. It directly reflects the research question.\n\nNext, we must distinguish between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.\nA **two-tailed test** is used when the researcher is interested in detecting a difference in either direction. The alternative hypothesis would be that the proportion of improved patients in the therapy group is simply *not equal* to the proportion in the placebo group. This would test if the therapy is either better *or* worse than the placebo.\n\nA **one-tailed test** is used when the researcher has a specific, directional hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis would state that the proportion of improved patients in the therapy group is *greater than* the proportion in the placebo group (a right-tailed test) or *less than* (a left-tailed test). This choice is made *a priori*, before collecting or analyzing the data, based on the scientific objective.\n\nIn this problem, the scenario explicitly states: \"The research team is only interested in whether the new therapy is strictly more effective than the placebo.\" This is a clear, directional question. The firm does not care to distinguish between \"no effect\" and \"worse than placebo\"; both outcomes lead to the project's failure. They are only looking for evidence of superiority.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate alternative hypothesis ($H_A$) is: The proportion of \"Improved\" patients in the gene therapy group (Group B) is greater than the proportion of \"Improved\" patients in the placebo group (Group A).\n\nThis directional alternative hypothesis requires a **one-tailed test**. The test will calculate the probability of observing a result as extreme or more extreme *in the direction of the alternative hypothesis* (i.e., more people improving in the therapy group), assuming the null hypothesis is true. A two-tailed test would be inappropriate as it would also consider the probability of the therapy being significantly worse, which is not the question of interest and would misallocate statistical power.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A. A two-tailed Fisher's exact test should be used because the null hypothesis is that there is no association...** This is incorrect. While the null hypothesis is one of no association, the choice between one and two tails is determined by the *alternative hypothesis*, which is shaped by the research question.\n*   **B. A one-tailed Fisher's exact test should be used because the scientific question is directional; the researchers are specifically investigating if the new therapy is *better* than the placebo, not just different.** This is the correct statement. It accurately links the directional nature of the research question (seeking superiority) to the choice of a one-tailed test.\n*   **C. A two-tailed Fisher's exact test should be used because it provides more statistical power...** This is false. For a fixed significance level ($\\alpha$), a one-tailed test has more statistical power to detect an effect in the specified direction than a two-tailed test. The two-tailed test must split the rejection region ($\\alpha$) into two tails, making it harder to find a significant result in either specific direction.\n*   **D. A one-tailed Fisher's exact test should be used only if the number of patients in the 'Improved' category is greater...** This is incorrect. The choice of the test is based on the *hypothesis* before the experiment, not on the *outcome* of the experiment. Using the data to decide which test to run is a form of p-hacking and is statistically invalid.\n*   **E. The choice between a one-tailed and a two-tailed test cannot be made until after the data is collected...** This is fundamentally incorrect. The hypothesis, and therefore the type of test, must be specified before data analysis to ensure the integrity of the statistical inference process.\n\nThus, the only correct description and justification is provided in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1917992"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of Fisher's Exact Test lies the hypergeometric distribution, which calculates the exact probability of observing a particular arrangement of data, assuming there is no underlying association between the variables.

The analysis is conditioned on the observed marginal totals: specifically, the total number of trials for each catalyst (6 for Alpha, 5 for Beta) and the total number of successes and failures across all trials (6 successes, 5 failures in total).\n\nUnder this null hypothesis, what is the exact probability of observing this particular distribution of outcomes?
