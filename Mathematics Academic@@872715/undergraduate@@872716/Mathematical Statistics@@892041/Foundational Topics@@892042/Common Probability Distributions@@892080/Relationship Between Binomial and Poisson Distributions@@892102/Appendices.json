Each batch consists of $n=25$ resistors. Due to the novelty of the process, the probability, $p$, that any single resistor is defective is relatively high, estimated to be $p=0.2$. Let the random variable $X$ represent the number of defective resistors in a batch. The true distribution for $X$ is a Binomial distribution, $B(n=25, p=0.2)$.\n\nAn intern suggests that for simplifying process control calculations, the number of defects $X$ could be approximated by a Poisson distribution. The intern's reasoning is that the expected number of defects per batch, $\\lambda = np = 25 \\times 0.2 = 5$, is a moderate value, making a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda=5$ a suitable model.\n\nAs the senior engineer, you must evaluate this suggestion. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental critique of using a Poisson approximation in this specific scenario?\n\nA. The suggestion is valid. A Poisson approximation is appropriate whenever the expected value $\\lambda = np$ is a moderate number, which is true here since $\\lambda=5$.\n\nB. The suggestion is invalid. A Poisson approximation is only appropriate when the number of trials $n$ is very large (e.g., a common rule is $n > 100$). Since $n=25$, the approximation is poor.\n\nC. The suggestion is invalid. A key requirement for a good Poisson approximation is that the probability of an event $p$ must be very small. Since $p=0.2$, this condition is strongly violated.\n\nD. The suggestion is invalid. The Poisson distribution is only used to model the number of events occurring over a continuous interval of time or space, not for a discrete number of trials like this.\n\nE. The suggestion is valid. The variance of the true Binomial distribution is $np(1-p) = 4$, which is very close to the mean of the proposed Poisson distribution, $\\lambda=5$, indicating a good fit.", "solution": "Let $X \\sim \\mathrm{Bin}(n,p)$ with probability mass function\n$$\n\\Pr(X=k)=\\binom{n}{k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}.\n$$\nA Poisson approximation with mean $\\lambda=np$ is justified by the limit in which $n \\to \\infty$, $p \\to 0$, and $\\lambda=np$ remains fixed.

Thus, a fundamental requirement for a good Poisson approximation to a binomial distribution is that $p$ be very small while $n$ is large enough that $\\lambda=np$ is of moderate size.\n\nIn the present case, $n=25$ and $p=0.2$. The condition $p \\ll 1$ is strongly violated. The error term in the exponent derived from $\\ln(1-p)$ is of order $n p^{2}$, which is not negligible when $p$ is not small. Therefore, the most accurate critique focuses on $p$ not being small.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- A is incorrect because having a moderate $\\lambda$ alone is not sufficient; one also needs $p \\ll 1$.\n- B is misleading because a large $n$ by itself does not guarantee a good Poisson approximation; the key is $p$ very small with $\\lambda=np$ fixed.\n- C is correct: a key requirement is that $p$ be very small, which is not met since $p=0.2$.\n- D is incorrect because the Poisson distribution is also used as an approximation to the binomial in the rare-event regime, not only for continuous-time or space counts.\n- E is incorrect because matching or comparing mean and variance is not the criterion for Poisson approximation; indeed $\\mathrm{Var}[\\mathrm{Bin}(n,p)]=np(1-p)=\\lambda(1-p)$ differs from the Poisson variance $\\lambda$ by a factor of $1-p$, with a relative discrepancy equal to $p$, which is not small here.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental critique is that $p$ is not very small, invalidating the Poisson approximation in this scenario.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1950665"}, {"introduction": "Now that we've established the ground rules, let's see the Poisson approximation in action.
