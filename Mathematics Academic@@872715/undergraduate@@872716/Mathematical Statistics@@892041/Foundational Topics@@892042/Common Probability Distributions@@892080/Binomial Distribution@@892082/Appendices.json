The process is still in the experimental phase, and each emitter produced has an independent probability of $0.80$ of meeting the stringent luminescence efficiency required for next-generation displays. For a quality control check, a batch of 8 emitters is randomly selected from the production line.\n\nWhat is the probability that more than 6 emitters in this batch meet the efficiency standard? Express your answer rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "Let $X$ be the random variable representing the number of emitters in the batch that meet the efficiency standard. The scenario describes a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same two possible outcomes (meeting the standard or not) and a constant probability of success. This is characteristic of a binomial distribution.\n\nThe parameters of the binomial distribution for this problem are:\n- The number of trials, $n=8$, which is the size of the batch.\n- The probability of success (an emitter meets the standard), $p=0.80$.\n- The probability of failure (an emitter does not meet the standard), $q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for a binomial distribution gives the probability of observing exactly $k$ successes in $n$ trials, and is given by the formula:\n$$P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^{k} q^{n-k}$$\nwhere $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ is the binomial coefficient.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that more than 6 emitters meet the standard. This corresponds to the event $X > 6$. Since the number of emitters must be an integer, this is equivalent to finding the probability that either 7 or 8 emitters meet the standard. We can express this as:\n$$P(X > 6) = P(X=7) + P(X=8)$$\n\nNow, we calculate each term separately using the PMF.\n\nFor $k=7$:\n$$P(X=7) = \\binom{8}{7} (0.80)^{7} (0.20)^{8-7}$$\nThe binomial coefficient is $\\binom{8}{7} = \\frac{8!}{7!(8-7)!} = \\frac{8!}{7!1!} = 8$.\nSo,\n$$P(X=7) = 8 \\cdot (0.80)^{7} \\cdot (0.20)^{1}$$\n\nFor $k=8$:\n$$P(X=8) = \\binom{8}{8} (0.80)^{8} (0.20)^{8-8}$$\nThe binomial coefficient is $\\binom{8}{8} = \\frac{8!}{8!(8-8)!} = \\frac{8!}{8!0!} = 1$. Note that $0! = 1$.\nSo,\n$$P(X=8) = 1 \\cdot (0.80)^{8} \\cdot (0.20)^{0} = (0.80)^{8}$$\n\nNow we substitute the numerical values and sum the probabilities:\n$$P(X > 6) = [8 \\cdot (0.80)^{7} \\cdot (0.20)] + [(0.80)^{8}]$$\nLet's evaluate the terms:\n$$(0.80)^{7} \\approx 0.2097152$$\n$$(0.80)^{8} \\approx 0.16777216$$\n\n$$P(X=7) \\approx 8 \\cdot (0.2097152) \\cdot 0.20 = 0.33554432$$\n$$P(X=8) \\approx 0.16777216$$\n\nSumming these probabilities:\n$$P(X > 6) \\approx 0.33554432 + 0.16777216 = 0.50331648$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are 5, 0, 3, 3. The fifth figure is 1, which is less than 5, so we round down.\n$$P(X > 6) \\approx 0.5033$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5033}$$", "id": "1900952"}, {"introduction": "In many real-world situations, we don't know the exact parameters of a process but can observe its outcomes.
