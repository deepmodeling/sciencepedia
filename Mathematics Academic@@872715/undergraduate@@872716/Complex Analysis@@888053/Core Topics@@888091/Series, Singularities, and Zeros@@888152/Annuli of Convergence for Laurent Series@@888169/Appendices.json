Centering at $z_{0}=0$, the distances to these singularities are $|3i|=3$, $|-3i|=3$, and $|4|=4$.\n\nFor a Laurent series centered at the origin, the annuli of convergence are determined by circles centered at the origin passing through singularities. The only non-degenerate annulus with non-zero inner radius and finite outer radius is the region between the nearest and the next-nearest singularity radii, namely $3|z|4$. This is because:\n- For $|z|3$, the function is analytic, yielding a Taylor series (inner radius zero, which is degenerate).\n- For $|z|>4$, the Laurent series would have infinite outer radius (which is not finite).\n- Therefore the unique non-degenerate annulus is $R_{1}=3$ and $R_{2}=4$.\n\nThe area of an annulus with inner radius $R_{1}$ and outer radius $R_{2}$ is given by the formula for the difference of disk areas:\n$$\n\\text{Area}=\\pi\\left(R_{2}^{2}-R_{1}^{2}\\right).\n$$\nSubstituting $R_{1}=3$ and $R_{2}=4$ gives\n$$\n\\text{Area}=\\pi\\left(4^{2}-3^{2}\\right)=\\pi\\left(16-9\\right)=7\\pi.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7\\pi}$$", "id": "2228853"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous exercise, we now move the center of our expansion away from the origin.
