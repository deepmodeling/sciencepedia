The function $f(z)=(z+a)e^{cz}$ is analytic on the entire complex plane. Its only zero is at $z=-a$.

On the boundary, we can write $z=x+iy$ where $x^2+y^2=1$, so $y^2=1-x^2$, and $x \\in [-1, 1]$.

The term in the brackets is a linear function of $x$. To determine its sign on $[-1, 1]$, we check its value at the endpoint $x=-1$:\n$$ (a+c+ca^2) + 2ac(-1) = a+c+ca^2-2ac = a + c(a^2-2a+1) = a + c(a-1)^2 $$\nSince $a>1$ and $c>0$, both $a$ and $c(a-1)^2$ are positive.

Since $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in [-1, 1]$, the function $g(x)$ is strictly increasing on this interval. Its minimum value is attained at $x=-1$.
