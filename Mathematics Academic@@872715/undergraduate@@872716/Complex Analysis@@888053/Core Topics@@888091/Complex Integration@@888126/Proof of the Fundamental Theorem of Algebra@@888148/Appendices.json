This approach continuously deforms the simple polynomial $z^n$ into our target polynomial $P(z)$ and shows that the number of roots must remain constant throughout this process. By following the logic presented, you will see how the continuity of the root-counting integral, combined with its integer-valued nature, forces $P(z)$ to have the same number of roots as $z^n$, namely $n$ [@problem_id:2259540].", "problem": "Consider a complex polynomial $P(z) = z^n + a_{n-1}z^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 z + a_0$, where $n$ is an integer such that $n \\ge 1$ and the coefficients $a_k$ (for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$) are complex numbers.\n\nTo analyze the roots of $P(z)$, we can continuously deform the simpler polynomial $z^n$ into $P(z)$.
