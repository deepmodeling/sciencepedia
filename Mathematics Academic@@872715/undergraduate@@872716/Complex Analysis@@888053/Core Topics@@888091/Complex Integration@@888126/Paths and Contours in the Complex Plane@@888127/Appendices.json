The path is given by the parabola $y=x^2$ from the origin $(0,0)$ to the point $(1,1)$. A natural parameterization is to set $x=t$. Then $y=t^2$. Since $x$ goes from 0 to 1, the parameter $t$ ranges from 0 to 1. The path $\\gamma$ can be represented by the complex function $z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) = t + it^2$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nNext, we calculate the differential $dz$ in terms of $t$. Differentiating $z(t)$ with respect to $t$, we get $z'(t) = \\frac{dz}{dt} = 1 + 2it$. Therefore, $dz = (1 + 2it)dt$.\n\nNow, we express the integrand $f(z) = |z|^2 - i\\operatorname{Im}(z^2)$ in terms of the parameter $t$. For a point $z = x+iy$ on the path, we have $x=t$ and $y=t^2$.\nThe squared modulus is $|z|^2 = x^2 + y^2 = t^2 + (t^2)^2 = t^2 + t^4$.\nTo find $\\operatorname{Im}(z^2)$, we first compute $z^2$:\n$$z^2 = (x+iy)^2 = x^2 - y^2 + 2ixy$$\nSubstituting $x=t$ and $y=t^2$, we get $z^2 = t^2 - (t^2)^2 + 2i(t)(t^2) = t^2 - t^4 + 2it^3$.\nThe imaginary part of $z^2$ is $\\operatorname{Im}(z^2) = 2t^3$.\nThus, the integrand becomes $f(z(t)) = (t^2 + t^4) - i(2t^3)$.\n\nWe are now ready to set up the integral in terms of $t$. The complex line integral is given by the formula $\\int_{\\gamma} f(z) dz = \\int_{a}^{b} f(z(t)) z'(t) dt$. Substituting our expressions:\n$$ \\int_{\\gamma} f(z) dz = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left( (t^2 + t^4) - i(2t^3) \\right) (1 + 2it) dt $$\nWe expand the product in the integrand:\n$$ \\left( t^2 + t^4 - i(2t^3) \\right) (1 + 2it) = (t^2 + t^4) \\cdot 1 + (t^2 + t^4) \\cdot (2it) - (i(2t^3)) \\cdot 1 - (i(2t^3)) \\cdot (2it) $$\n$$ = t^2 + t^4 + 2it^3 + 2it^5 - 2it^3 - 4i^2t^4 $$\nSince $i^2 = -1$, this simplifies to:\n$$ = t^2 + t^4 + 2it^3 + 2it^5 - 2it^3 + 4t^4 $$\nCombining real and imaginary parts:\n$$ = (t^2 + t^4 + 4t^4) + i(2t^3 + 2t^5 - 2t^3) = (t^2 + 5t^4) + i(2t^5) $$\nSo the integral becomes:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{1} (t^2 + 5t^4 + i(2t^5)) dt $$\nWe integrate term by term:\n$$ \\left[ \\frac{t^3}{3} + 5\\frac{t^5}{5} + i\\frac{2t^6}{6} \\right]_{0}^{1} = \\left[ \\frac{t^3}{3} + t^5 + i\\frac{t^6}{3} \\right]_{0}^{1} $$\nFinally, we evaluate the expression at the limits of integration:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{1^3}{3} + 1^5 + i\\frac{1^6}{3} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{0^3}{3} + 0^5 + i\\frac{0^6}{3} \\right) $$\n$$ = \\left( \\frac{1}{3} + 1 + \\frac{i}{3} \\right) - 0 = \\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}i $$\nThe resulting complex number is in the form $a+bi$ with $a=4/3$ and $b=1/3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}i}$$", "id": "2257386"}, {"introduction": "In practice, integration paths are often composed of several distinct segments, such as straight lines and circular arcs.
