Suppose $f$ is uniformly continuous on $(0,1]$ and on $[1,\\infty)$. Fix $\\varepsilon0$. There exist $\\delta_{1}0$ such that for all $x,y\\in(0,1]$, if $|x-y|\\delta_{1}$ then $|f(x)-f(y)|\\varepsilon/2$, and there exist $\\delta_{2}0$ such that for all $x,y\\in[1,\\infty)$, if $|x-y|\\delta_{2}$ then $|f(x)-f(y)|\\varepsilon/2$. Set $\\delta=\\min\\{\\delta_{1},\\delta_{2},1\\}$. Take any $x,y\\in(0,\\infty)$ with $|x-y|\\delta$. Consider cases:\n- If $x,y\\in(0,1]$, then $|f(x)-f(y)|\\varepsilon/2\\varepsilon$ by the choice of $\\delta_{1}$.\n- If $x,y\\in[1,\\infty)$, then $|f(x)-f(y)|\\varepsilon/2\\varepsilon$ by the choice of $\\delta_{2}$.\n- If $x\\in(0,1]$ and $y\\in[1,\\infty)$ (or vice versa), then since $y\\geq 1\\geq x$ and $|y-x|\\delta\\leq 1$, we have\n$$\n1-x\\leq y-x\\delta\\quad\\text{and}\\quad y-1\\leq y-x\\delta,\n$$\nhence $|x-1|\\delta\\leq\\delta_{1}$ and $|y-1|\\delta\\leq\\delta_{2}$. Because $1\\in(0,1]\\cap[1,\\infty)$, applying uniform continuity on each side with the point $1$ gives\n$$\n|f(x)-f(1)|\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad |f(y)-f(1)|\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}.\n$$\nBy the triangle inequality,\n$$\n|f(x)-f(y)|\\leq |f(x)-f(1)|+|f(1)-f(y)|\\varepsilon.\n$$\nTherefore, for all $x,y\\in(0,\\infty)$ with $|x-y|\\delta$, we have $|f(x)-f(y)|\\varepsilon$, proving that $f$ is uniformly continuous on $(0,\\infty)$. Hence A must be true.\n\nNext, evaluate B and C. Since uniform continuity implies continuity at every point of the domain, $f$ is continuous on $(0,1]$ and on $[1,\\infty)$; in particular, at $x=1$ it is continuous from both sides and the value $f(1)$ is the same, so $f$ is continuous on $(0,\\infty)$. However, A shows that $f$ is actually uniformly continuous on $(0,\\infty)$, so the clause “but not necessarily uniformly continuous” in B is false; thus B is not a must-true statement. Since $f$ is continuous at $x=1$, statement C is false.\n\nNow prove D. Let $(x_{n})$ be any sequence in $(0,1]$ with $x_{n}\\to 0^{+}$. Then $(x_{n})$ is Cauchy. Uniform continuity of $f$ on $(0,1]$ implies $f$ maps Cauchy sequences to Cauchy sequences, so $(f(x_{n}))$ is Cauchy in $\\mathbb{R}$ and hence convergent to some finite limit. To show the limit as $x\\to 0^{+}f(x)$ is independent of the sequence, take two sequences $(x_{n})$ and $(y_{n})$ in $(0,1]$ with $x_{n}\\to 0^{+}$ and $y_{n}\\to 0^{+}$, and interleave them into $z_{2n-1}=x_{n}$, $z_{2n}=y_{n}$. Then $(z_{n})$ is Cauchy and $z_{n}\\to 0^{+}$, so $(f(z_{n}))$ is Cauchy and converges to a unique limit $L$. Since $(f(x_{n}))$ and $(f(y_{n}))$ are subsequences of $(f(z_{n}))$, they both converge to $L$. Therefore $\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}f(x)$ exists and is finite. Hence D must be true.\n\nFinally, assess E. Uniform continuity on an unbounded interval does not imply boundedness. For example, $f(x)=x$ is uniformly continuous on both $(0,1]$ and $[1,\\infty)$ (indeed on all of $(0,\\infty)$), yet it is unbounded. Therefore E is false.\n\nIn conclusion, the statements that must be true are A and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "1342185"}]}
