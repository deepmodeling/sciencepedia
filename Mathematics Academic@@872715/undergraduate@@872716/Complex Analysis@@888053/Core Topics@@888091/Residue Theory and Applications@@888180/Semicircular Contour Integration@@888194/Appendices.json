We consider the complex function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^4 + z^2 + 1}$. The integral can be found by evaluating the contour integral $\\oint_C f(z) \\, dz$ over a specific contour $C$ and then taking a limit.\n\nThe standard contour for this type of integral is a semicircle in the upper half of the complex plane. Let $C$ be the closed contour consisting of the line segment from $-R$ to $R$ on the real axis, and the semicircle $\\Gamma_R$ of radius $R$ in the upper half-plane, centered at the origin, traversed counter-clockwise. For $R$ large enough, this contour will enclose all the poles of $f(z)$ in the upper half-plane.\n\nFirst, we find the poles of $f(z)$ by solving for the roots of the denominator: $z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0$.\nLet $u = z^2$. The equation becomes a quadratic in $u$: $u^2 + u + 1 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find the roots for $u$:\n$$\nu = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n$$\nThese two values for $u$ are the non-real cube roots of unity.
