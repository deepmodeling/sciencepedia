Then $S=\\overline{D} \\setminus I$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the interior of $S$, denoted $S^{\\circ}$. A point is in the interior if it has a neighborhood entirely contained in $S$.\nConsider a point $z_0 \\in S$.\n- If $|z_0|=1$, any neighborhood of $z_0$ contains points with modulus greater than 1, which are not in $\\overline{D}$ and thus not in $S$. So, points on the unit circle are not interior points.\n- If $|z_0|  1$ and $\\operatorname{Im}(z_0) \\neq 0$, then $z_0$ is in the open unit disk and not on the real axis. We can find a small enough open disk centered at $z_0$ that is still within the open unit disk and does not intersect the real axis. All points in such a disk are in $S$. Thus, these points are interior points.\nTherefore, the interior of $S$ is the set of points in the open unit disk that are not on the real axis. The part of the real axis inside the open unit disk is the open interval $(-1, 1)$. However, the definition of $S$ removes the closed interval $[-1, 1]$.\nSo, $S^{\\circ}=\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z|1\\} \\setminus \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} : -1 \\le x \\le 1\\}$.\n\nNext, let's determine the closure of $S$, denoted $\\overline{S}$. The closure of $S$ is the union of $S$ and its limit points. We need to find the limit points of $S$ that are not already in $S$. The points not in $S$ are those in $I$.\nLet's check if any point $w \\in I$ is a limit point of $S$. For any such $w$, we must show that every open disk $B(w, r)$ with $r0$ contains a point of $S$.\n- Let $w \\in I$, so $w$ is a real number with $-1 \\le w \\le 1$.\n- Consider the point $z = w + i\\epsilon$ for a small real number $\\epsilon$. The distance $|z-w| = |\\epsilon|$. We can choose $\\epsilon$ small enough so that $|z-w|  r$.\n- We also need to ensure $z \\in S$. This requires $|z| \\le 1$ and $z \\notin I$. Since $\\operatorname{Im}(z)=\\epsilon \\neq 0$ (for $\\epsilon \\neq 0$), $z \\notin I$ is satisfied. We need $|z|^2 = w^2 + \\epsilon^2 \\le 1$. Since $|w| \\le 1$, we have $w^2 \\le 1$. We can choose $\\epsilon$ small enough such that $\\epsilon^2 \\le 1 - w^2$.\n- For any $r0$, we can find an $\\epsilon$ such that $0  |\\epsilon|  r$ and $w^2+\\epsilon^2 \\le 1$. The point $z=w+i\\epsilon$ is then in $S \\cap B(w,r)$.\n- This shows that every point in the interval $I$ is a limit point of $S$.\nThe closure $\\overline{S}$ is $S \\cup I$.
