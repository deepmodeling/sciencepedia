The problem asks for the Euclidean distance between these two points in the complex plane, which is given by the modulus of their difference, $|z_1 - z_2|$.\n\nFirst, we write down the explicit forms of $z_1$ and $z_2$ using the given formula for the roots of unity, $\\omega_k = \\exp\\left(i \\frac{2\\pi k}{12}\\right) = \\exp\\left(i \\frac{\\pi k}{6}\\right)$.\n\nFor $k=2$, the first state is:\n$$z_1 = \\omega_2 = \\exp\\left(i \\frac{2\\pi}{6}\\right) = \\exp\\left(i \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$$\n\nFor $k=7$, the second state is:\n$$z_2 = \\omega_7 = \\exp\\left(i \\frac{7\\pi}{6}\\right)$$\n\nThe distance $d$ is $|z_1 - z_2|$. We can solve this geometrically. The roots of unity lie on the unit circle in the complex plane, so $|z_1| = |\\omega_2| = 1$ and $|z_2| = |\\omega_7| = 1$. The points representing $z_1$, $z_2$, and the origin $O$ form an isosceles triangle with two sides of length 1. The distance $d$ is the length of the third side of this triangle.\n\nThe angle $\\theta$ at the origin between the vectors representing $z_1$ and $z_2$ is the absolute difference of their arguments:\n$$\\theta = |\\arg(z_2) - \\arg(z_1)|$$\nThe arguments are $\\arg(z_1) = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and $\\arg(z_2) = \\frac{7\\pi}{6}$.\n$$\\theta = \\left|\\frac{7\\pi}{6} - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{7\\pi - 2\\pi}{6}\\right| = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$$\n\nWe can now use the Law of Cosines to find the distance $d$:\n$$d^2 = |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 - 2|z_1||z_2|\\cos(\\theta)$$\nSubstituting $|z_1|=1$, $|z_2|=1$, and $\\theta = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$:\n$$d^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 - 2(1)(1)\\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\right)$$\n$$d^2 = 2 - 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\right)$$\n\nWe evaluate the cosine term.
