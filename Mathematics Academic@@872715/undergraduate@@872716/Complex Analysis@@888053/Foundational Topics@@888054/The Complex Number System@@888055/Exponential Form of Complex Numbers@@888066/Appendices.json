The set $S$ is finite if and only if the sequence of points $z_n = \\beta^n$ is periodic. This means there exist two distinct non-negative integers $n_1$ and $n_2$ such that $z_{n_1} = z_{n_2}$. Let's assume $n_2 > n_1$.\nThe condition $z_{n_2} = z_{n_1}$ translates to $\\beta^{n_2} = \\beta^{n_1}$. Since $\\beta \\neq 0$, we can divide by $\\beta^{n_1}$ to get $\\beta^{n_2 - n_1} = 1$. Let $k = n_2 - n_1$, which is a positive integer. So, the set $S$ is finite if and only if there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $\\beta^k = 1$.\n\nIn our problem, $\\beta = \\exp\\left(i \\frac{2\\pi}{p}\\right)$. The condition $\\beta^k = 1$ becomes:\n$$ \\left(\\exp\\left(i \\frac{2\\pi}{p}\\right)\\right)^k = 1 $$\n$$ \\exp\\left(i \\frac{2\\pi k}{p}\\right) = 1 $$\nFrom Euler's identity, we know that $\\exp(i\\phi) = 1$ if and only if $\\phi$ is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. That is, $\\phi = 2\\pi j$ for some integer $j$.\nTherefore, we must have:\n$$ \\frac{2\\pi k}{p} = 2\\pi j $$\nfor some positive integer $k$ and some non-zero integer $j$ (since $k>0$ and $p>0$, $j$ must be non-zero). Solving for $p$, we get:\n$$ p = \\frac{k}{j} $$\nThis shows that the set $S$ is finite if and only if $p$ is a rational number. If $p$ is irrational, no such integers $k$ and $j$ exist, and all points $\\beta^n$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ will be distinct. Thus, the set $S$ will be infinite.\n\nNow we apply this principle to the two cases.\n\n**Case 1: $p_1 = \\sqrt{144}$**\nThe value of $p_1$ is $p_1 = \\sqrt{144} = 12$.\nThe number 12 is a rational number (it can be written as the fraction $\\frac{12}{1}$).\nTherefore, based on our derived condition, the set $S_1$ must be finite.\nIndeed, the multiplier is $\\beta_1 = \\exp\\left(i \\frac{2\\pi}{12}\\right) = \\exp\\left(i \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)$.\nLet's check for which positive integer $k$ we have $\\beta_1^k=1$. We need $k=p_1=12$.\n$$ \\beta_1^{12} = \\left(\\exp\\left(i \\frac{2\\pi}{12}\\right)\\right)^{12} = \\exp(i 2\\pi) = 1 $$\nThis means the sequence of points repeats after 12 steps (i.e., $z_{n+12} = z_n$). The set $S_1$ consists of the 12 distinct points $\\{ \\beta_1^0, \\beta_1^1, \\dots, \\beta_1^{11} \\}$. So, $S_1$ is a finite set with 12 elements.\n\n**Case 2: $p_2 = \\sqrt{145}$**\nThe value of $p_2$ is $\\sqrt{145}$.\nTo determine if $p_2$ is rational or irrational, we check if 145 is a perfect square. The integers whose squares are close to 145 are $12^2 = 144$ and $13^2 = 169$. Since 145 is not a perfect square, its square root, $\\sqrt{145}$, is an irrational number.\nThus, $p_2$ is an irrational number.\nAccording to our general condition, since $p_2$ is irrational, there is no positive integer $k$ for which $\\beta_2^k = 1$. If there were such a $k$, we would have $k/j = p_2 = \\sqrt{145}$ for some integer $j$, which would imply that $\\sqrt{145}$ is rational. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, for any two distinct non-negative integers $n_1$ and $n_2$, we have $\\beta_2^{n_1} \\neq \\beta_2^{n_2}$. This means that every point generated by the process is unique. Consequently, the set $S_2$ contains infinitely many distinct points.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe set $S_1$ is finite, and the set $S_2$ is infinite.
