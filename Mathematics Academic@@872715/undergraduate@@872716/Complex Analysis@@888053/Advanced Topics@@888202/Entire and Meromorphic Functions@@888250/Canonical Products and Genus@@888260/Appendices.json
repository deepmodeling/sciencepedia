The existence and form of this product depend on the distribution of the zeros. A crucial parameter in this construction is the *genus* of the sequence of zeros, denoted by $p$. The genus $p$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer for which the sum $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{|z_n|^{p+1}}$ is a convergent series.\n\nConsider a sequence of zeros given by $z_n = n^{1/3}$ for all positive integers $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\nDetermine the value of the genus $p$ for this sequence of zeros.", "solution": "The problem asks for the genus $p$ of the sequence of zeros $z_n = n^{1/3}$, where $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$. According to the problem statement, the genus $p$ is the smallest non-negative integer for which the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{|z_n|^{p+1}}$ converges.\n\nFirst, we substitute the given sequence of zeros into the general form of the series. The zeros are $z_n = n^{1/3}$. Since $n$ is a positive integer, all $z_n$ are real and positive. Therefore, the modulus of each zero is simply the value itself: $|z_n| = z_n = n^{1/3}$.\n\nThe series to be analyzed for convergence is:\n$$ S_p = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{|z_n|^{p+1}} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(n^{1/3})^{p+1}} $$\nUsing the property of exponents $(a^b)^c = a^{bc}$, we can simplify the denominator:\n$$ (n^{1/3})^{p+1} = n^{\\frac{p+1}{3}} $$\nThis allows us to rewrite the series as:\n$$ S_p = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{(p+1)/3}} $$\nThis series is a p-series, which has the general form $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^k}$. A p-series is known to converge if its exponent $k$ is strictly greater than 1 (i.e., $k > 1$) and diverge if $k \\le 1$.\n\nIn our case, the exponent is $k = \\frac{p+1}{3}$. For the series $S_p$ to converge, we must satisfy the condition:\n$$ \\frac{p+1}{3} > 1 $$\nWe can solve this inequality for $p$:\n$$ p+1 > 3 $$\n$$ p > 2 $$\nThe problem requires $p$ to be the smallest non-negative integer that satisfies this condition. The non-negative integers are $0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$. The integers satisfying $p > 2$ are $3, 4, 5, \\ldots$. The smallest integer in this set is $3$.\n\nTo be thorough, let's explicitly test the first few non-negative integer values of $p$:\n- If $p=0$, the exponent is $\\frac{0+1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$. Since $\\frac{1}{3} \\le 1$, the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{1/3}}$ diverges.\n- If $p=1$, the exponent is $\\frac{1+1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$. Since $\\frac{2}{3} \\le 1$, the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{2/3}}$ diverges.\n- If $p=2$, the exponent is $\\frac{2+1}{3} = 1$. The series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{1}}$ is the harmonic series, which is a classic example of a divergent series.\n- If $p=3$, the exponent is $\\frac{3+1}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}$. Since $\\frac{4}{3} > 1$, the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{4/3}}$ converges.\n\nThus, the smallest non-negative integer $p$ for which the series converges is $p=3$.
