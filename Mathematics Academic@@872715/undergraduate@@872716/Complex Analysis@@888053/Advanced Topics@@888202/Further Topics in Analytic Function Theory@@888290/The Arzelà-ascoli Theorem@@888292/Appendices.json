Let $z$ be any fixed point in $D$. By definition of $D$, we have $|z| \\leq 1$. For any function $f_n(z) = z^n$ in $\\mathcal{F}_1$, we can evaluate its magnitude:\n$$|f_n(z)| = |z^n| = |z|^n$$\nSince $|z| \\leq 1$, we have $|z|^n \\leq 1^n = 1$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Thus, for any $z \\in D$, the set of values $\\{f_n(z)\\}$ is bounded by $M_z = 1$. Therefore, the family $\\mathcal{F}_1$ is pointwise bounded on $D$.\n\nNext, we check for equicontinuity. For a family to be equicontinuous, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there must exist a single $\\delta > 0$ that works for all functions in the family. Let's test this by trying to find a counterexample. Let's choose $\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{2}$. We will now show that for any $\\delta > 0$, we can find two points $z_1, z_2$ with $|z_1 - z_2|  \\delta$ and a function $f_n \\in \\mathcal{F}_1$ such that $|f_n(z_1) - f_n(z_2)| \\geq \\epsilon$.\nLet's choose $z_1 = 1 \\in D$. For any given $\\delta > 0$ (we can assume $\\delta  2$), let's choose $z_2 = 1 - \\frac{\\delta}{2}$. This point $z_2$ is real and $0  z_2  1$, so $z_2 \\in D$. The distance is $|z_1 - z_2| = |1 - (1 - \\frac{\\delta}{2})| = \\frac{\\delta}{2}  \\delta$.\nNow consider the difference $|f_n(z_1) - f_n(z_2)|$ for $f_n(z)=z^n$:\n$$|f_n(1) - f_n(1 - \\frac{\\delta}{2})| = |1^n - (1 - \\frac{\\delta}{2})^n| = |1 - (1 - \\frac{\\delta}{2})^n|$$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, since $|1 - \\frac{\\delta}{2}|  1$, the term $(1 - \\frac{\\delta}{2})^n \\to 0$. This means that for any $\\delta$, we can find a sufficiently large integer $N$ such that for all $n > N$, $(1 - \\frac{\\delta}{2})^n  \\frac{1}{2}$. For such an $n$, we have:\n$$|1 - (1 - \\frac{\\delta}{2})^n| > 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} = \\epsilon$$\nThis shows that no single $\\delta$ can work for all $n$ when $\\epsilon = 1/2$. Thus, the family $\\mathcal{F}_1$ is not equicontinuous on $D$.\n\n**Conclusion for $\\mathcal{F}_1$**: It is pointwise bounded but not equicontinuous.\n\n**Analysis of Family $\\mathcal{F}_2 = \\{g_n(z) = \\frac{z^n}{n}\\}$**\n\nFirst, we check for pointwise boundedness. For any fixed $z \\in D$, we have $|z| \\leq 1$. For any function $g_n(z) = z^n/n$ in $\\mathcal{F}_2$:\n$$|g_n(z)| = \\left|\\frac{z^n}{n}\\right| = \\frac{|z^n|}{n} = \\frac{|z|^n}{n} \\leq \\frac{1^n}{n} = \\frac{1}{n}$$\nFor any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $1/n \\leq 1$. So for any $z \\in D$, the set of values $\\{g_n(z)\\}$ is bounded by $M_z = 1$. Therefore, the family $\\mathcal{F}_2$ is pointwise bounded.\n\nNext, we check for equicontinuity. Let $\\epsilon > 0$ be given. We need to find a $\\delta > 0$ that works for all $g_n \\in \\mathcal{F}_2$. Let's consider the difference $|g_n(z_1) - g_n(z_2)|$ for any two points $z_1, z_2 \\in D$:\n$$|g_n(z_1) - g_n(z_2)| = \\left|\\frac{z_1^n}{n} - \\frac{z_2^n}{n}\\right| = \\frac{1}{n}|z_1^n - z_2^n|$$\nWe use the algebraic identity $a^n - b^n = (a-b)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + \\dots + b^{n-1})$.\n$$|z_1^n - z_2^n| = |z_1 - z_2| \\cdot |z_1^{n-1} + z_1^{n-2}z_2 + \\dots + z_2^{n-1}|$$\nBy the triangle inequality, and since $|z_1| \\leq 1$ and $|z_2| \\leq 1$:\n$$|z_1^{n-1} + z_1^{n-2}z_2 + \\dots + z_2^{n-1}| \\leq |z_1|^{n-1} + |z_1|^{n-2}|z_2| + \\dots + |z_2|^{n-1} \\leq \\underbrace{1 + 1 + \\dots + 1}_{n \\text{ terms}} = n$$\nSubstituting this back into our expression for $|g_n(z_1) - g_n(z_2)|$:\n$$|g_n(z_1) - g_n(z_2)| = \\frac{1}{n}|z_1^n - z_2^n| \\leq \\frac{1}{n} |z_1 - z_2| \\cdot n = |z_1 - z_2|$$\nThis inequality, $|g_n(z_1) - g_n(z_2)| \\leq |z_1 - z_2|$, holds for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nNow, to satisfy the definition of equicontinuity, we are given an $\\epsilon > 0$. We can simply choose $\\delta = \\epsilon$. Then for any $z_1, z_2 \\in D$ such that $|z_1 - z_2|  \\delta$, we have:\n$$|g_n(z_1) - g_n(z_2)| \\leq |z_1 - z_2|  \\delta = \\epsilon$$\nThis inequality holds for all $g_n \\in \\mathcal{F}_2$. Therefore, the family $\\mathcal{F}_2$ is equicontinuous on $D$.\n\n**Conclusion for $\\mathcal{F}_2$**: It is both pointwise bounded and equicontinuous.\n\n**Final Comparison**\nOur analysis shows:\n- $\\mathcal{F}_1$ is pointwise bounded, but not equicontinuous.\n- $\\mathcal{F}_2$ is both pointwise bounded and equicontinuous.\n\nThis matches statement B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2269330"}, {"introduction": "In complex analysis, the power of the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem is harnessed through Montel's theorem, which simplifies the conditions for families of holomorphic functions.
