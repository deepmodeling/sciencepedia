The Green's function for the domain $D$, denoted by $G(z, w)$, characterizes the potential at a point $z \\in D$ due to a point source at $w \\in D$. It is a real-valued function of two complex variables, $z$ and $w$, that is uniquely defined by the following two properties:\n\n1.  For any fixed source point $w \\in D$, the function defined by the difference $G(z, w) + \\ln|z-w|$ is harmonic with respect to the variable $z$ for all $z \\in D$.\n2.  For any point $z$ on the boundary of the disk (i.e., for any $z$ such that $|z|=1$), the value of the Green's function is zero: $G(z, w) = 0$.\n\nConsider the specific case where the source point $w$ is located at the origin of the complex plane, i.e., $w=0$.
