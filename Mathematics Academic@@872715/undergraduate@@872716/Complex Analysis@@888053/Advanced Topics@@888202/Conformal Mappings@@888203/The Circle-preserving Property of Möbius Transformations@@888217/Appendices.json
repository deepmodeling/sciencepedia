This hands-on practice allows you to construct a specific transformation from scratch based on a set of mapping conditions.

This transformation is known to map the circle described by the equation $|z|=2$ onto a straight line in the $w$-plane. The transformation is uniquely defined by the following three mapping conditions:\n1. The point $z=2$ on the circle is mapped to the point at infinity.\n2. The point $z=-2$ on the circle is mapped to the point $w=3$.\n3. The point $z=2i$ on the circle is mapped to the point $w=3+3i$.\n\nDetermine the function $f(z)$ that satisfies these conditions.

Therefore,\n$$\nf(z) = \\frac{az + b}{c(z - 2)}.\n$$\nSince multiplying numerator and denominator by the same nonzero constant does not change the transformation, we may set $c = 1$ without loss of generality, giving\n$$\nf(z) = \\frac{az + b}{z - 2}.\n$$\nUsing $f(-2) = 3$,\n$$\n\\frac{-2a + b}{-4} = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -2a + b = -12.\n$$\nUsing $f(2i) = 3 + 3i$,\n$$\n\\frac{2ai + b}{2i - 2} = 3 + 3i \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2ai + b = (3 + 3i)(2i - 2).\n$$\nCompute the right-hand side:\n$$\n(3 + 3i)(2i - 2) = 6i - 6 + 6i^{2} - 6i = -12.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\n2ai + b = -12.\n$$\nFrom $-2a + b = -12$, we have $b = -12 + 2a$.
