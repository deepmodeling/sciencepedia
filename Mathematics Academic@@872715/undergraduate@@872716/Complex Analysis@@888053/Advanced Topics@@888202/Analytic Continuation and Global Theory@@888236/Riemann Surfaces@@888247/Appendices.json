This corresponds to moving clockwise along the unit circle. Starting from $z_0 = i$ with angle $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we move clockwise, so the angle must decrease.\n- The path reaches $z=1$, where the angle is $0$.\n- It continues into the fourth quadrant, reaching $z=-i$, where the angle is $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n- Finally, it arives at the destination $z_f = -1$ from the third quadrant.
