In one dimension, the Lie bracket $[X, Y]$ is always zero for any pair of vector fields $X$ and $Y$.

Any connection on a one-dimensional manifold is necessarily the flat connection, for which all Christoffel symbols are zero in any local coordinate system. Since the components of the torsion tensor are composed of differences of Christoffel symbols, they must all be zero.\n\nC. The torsion tensor $T(X, Y)$ is by definition antisymmetric in its vector arguments. On a one-dimensional manifold, any two tangent vectors at a point are linearly dependent. These two properties combined imply that the torsion tensor must evaluate to zero for any pair of vector fields.\n\nD. A one-dimensional manifold is always flat, meaning its Riemann curvature tensor is zero. The torsion tensor is intrinsically linked to the curvature tensor through the Bianchi identities, and the vanishing of curvature forces the torsion to vanish as well.\n\nE. Any vector field on a one-dimensional manifold can be locally expressed as $X = f(x) \\frac{d}{dx}$. The action of the covariant derivative and the Lie bracket on such fields simplifies in one dimension such that all terms in the expression for $T(X, Y)$ mutually cancel, as can be shown by direct computation in local coordinates.
