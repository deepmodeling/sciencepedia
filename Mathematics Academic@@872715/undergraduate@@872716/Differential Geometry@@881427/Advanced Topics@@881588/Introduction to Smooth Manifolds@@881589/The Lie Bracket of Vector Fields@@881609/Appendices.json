If $[X, Y] = 0$, the vector fields are said to commute.\n\nA fundamental result, often called the simultaneous straightening theorem, states that if two vector fields $X$ and $Y$ are linearly independent at a point and commute in a neighborhood of that point, then there exists a local coordinate system $(u,v)$ such that the vector fields take the constant form $X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}$ and $Y = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}$.
