A smooth map to $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is a submersion at a point if the Jacobian matrix has rank $2$ there. Thus we must compute the Jacobian and determine where its rank is less than $2$.\n\nCompute the partial derivatives of the components:\n- For $f_{1}(x,y,z)=x-y^{2}$, we have $\\frac{\\partial f_{1}}{\\partial x}=1$, $\\frac{\\partial f_{1}}{\\partial y}=-2y$, $\\frac{\\partial f_{1}}{\\partial z}=0$.\n- For $f_{2}(x,y,z)=yz$, we have $\\frac{\\partial f_{2}}{\\partial x}=0$, $\\frac{\\partial f_{2}}{\\partial y}=z$, $\\frac{\\partial f_{2}}{\\partial z}=y$.\n\nHence the Jacobian matrix is\n$$\nJ_{f}(x,y,z)=\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -2y & 0\\\\\n0 & z & y\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nLet the row vectors be $r_{1}=(1,-2y,0)$ and $r_{2}=(0,z,y)$. The rank is $2$ if and only if $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ are linearly independent; it is less than $2$ if and only if they are linearly dependent. Since $r_{1}$ has first component $1$, it is never the zero vector, so the only way for dependence is if there exists $\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{R}$ with $r_{2}=\\lambda r_{1}$. Comparing the first components gives $0=\\lambda\\cdot 1$, hence $\\lambda=0$. Therefore $r_{2}=0$ must hold for dependence, which means $z=0$ and $y=0$.\n\nThus the rank drops from $2$ to $1$ precisely when $(x,y,z)$ satisfies $y=0$ and $z=0$, with $x$ arbitrary.
