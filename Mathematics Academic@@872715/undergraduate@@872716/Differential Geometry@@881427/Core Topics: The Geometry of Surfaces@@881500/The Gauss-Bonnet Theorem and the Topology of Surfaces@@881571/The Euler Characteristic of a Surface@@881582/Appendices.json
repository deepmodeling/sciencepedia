Let's label the vertices of the octagon $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_8$ in a counter-clockwise direction. An edge labeled 'x' starting at vertex $v_i$ and ending at $v_{i+1}$ can be denoted as $(v_i, v_{i+1})$.

We can count the edges by summing the number of edges for all faces and then dividing by two, since each edge is shared by exactly two adjacent faces. A pentagon has 5 edges and a heptagon has 7 edges. Therefore, summing the edges over all faces gives $5N_5 + 7N_7$. This sum counts each edge twice, so we have:\n$$ 2E = 5N_5 + 7N_7 $$\n$$ E = \\frac{1}{2}(5N_5 + 7N_7) $$\n\nFinally, we determine the total number of vertices, $V$. The problem states that exactly three faces meet at each vertex. In such a polyhedral complex, this implies that exactly three edges also meet at each vertex. This means every vertex has a degree of 3. We can relate the number of vertices and edges using a double-counting argument (also known as the handshaking lemma). The sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges. Since every one of the $V$ vertices has a degree of 3, the sum of the degrees is $3V$.
