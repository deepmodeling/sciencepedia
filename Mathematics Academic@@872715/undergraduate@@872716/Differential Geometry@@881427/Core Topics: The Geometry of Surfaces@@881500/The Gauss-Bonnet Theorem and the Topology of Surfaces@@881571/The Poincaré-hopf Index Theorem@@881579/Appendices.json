This vector field has an isolated singularity (a zero) at the origin $(0,0)$. The index of an isolated zero of a vector field is a fundamental concept in topology and dynamical systems, quantifying the local structure of the field around the singularity. It is defined as the integer number of times the vector field rotates counter-clockwise as we traverse a small, simple, closed, counter-clockwise path that encloses only this zero. Calculate the index of this vector field $V$ at the origin.", "solution": "To calculate the index of the vector field $V(x,y) = (P(x,y), Q(x,y)) = (x^2-y^2, 2xy)$ at the isolated zero at the origin $(0,0)$, we need to determine the total number of counter-clockwise rotations the vector makes as we travel along a simple closed curve that encircles the origin once in a counter-clockwise direction. The index is independent of the choice of this curve, as long as it encloses only the origin.\n\nLet's choose a circle $C$ of radius $R>0$ centered at the origin. A convenient parametrization for this circle is given by:\n$$x(t) = R\\cos(t)$$\n$$y(t) = R\\sin(t)$$\nfor $t$ varying from $0$ to $2\\pi$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the components of the vector field $V$ along this circular path. We substitute the expressions for $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ into $P(x,y)$ and $Q(x,y)$:\nThe first component is:\n$$P(t) = x(t)^2 - y(t)^2 = (R\\cos(t))^2 - (R\\sin(t))^2 = R^2(\\cos^2(t) - \\sin^2(t))$$\nUsing the double-angle trigonometric identity $\\cos(2\\alpha) = \\cos^2(\\alpha) - \\sin^2(\\alpha)$, we get:\n$$P(t) = R^2\\cos(2t)$$\n\nThe second component is:\n$$Q(t) = 2x(t)y(t) = 2(R\\cos(t))(R\\sin(t)) = R^2(2\\sin(t)\\cos(t))$$\nUsing the double-angle trigonometric identity $\\sin(2\\alpha) = 2\\sin(\\alpha)\\cos(\\alpha)$, we get:\n$$Q(t) = R^2\\sin(2t)$$\n\nSo, for any point on the circle $C$ parameterized by $t$, the vector field is given by $V(t) = (R^2\\cos(2t), R^2\\sin(2t))$.\n\nLet $\\theta(t)$ be the angle that the vector $V(t)$ makes with the positive x-axis. This angle is determined by the components of the vector. The vector $V(t)$ has the form $(A\\cos(\\phi), A\\sin(\\phi))$ where the amplitude is $A=R^2$ and the angle is $\\phi=2t$. Thus, the angle of the vector field at parameter $t$ is:\n$$\\theta(t) = 2t$$\nThis relationship shows how the angle of the vector field changes as we traverse the circle.\n\nTo find the index, we need to find the total change in the angle $\\theta(t)$ as the parameter $t$ goes from $0$ to $2\\pi$, and then divide this total change by $2\\pi$.\nAt the start of the path, $t=0$, the angle is:\n$$\\theta(0) = 2(0) = 0$$\nAt the end of the path, $t=2\\pi$, the angle is:\n$$\\theta(2\\pi) = 2(2\\pi) = 4\\pi$$\n\nThe total change in the angle, $\\Delta\\theta$, is:\n$$\\Delta\\theta = \\theta(2\\pi) - \\theta(0) = 4\\pi - 0 = 4\\pi$$\n\nThe index is the total number of full counter-clockwise rotations, which is the total change in angle divided by $2\\pi$:\n$$\\text{Index} = \\frac{\\Delta\\theta}{2\\pi} = \\frac{4\\pi}{2\\pi} = 2$$\nThis means that as we trace the circle once around the origin, the vector field $V$ rotates counter-clockwise two full times.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1681353"}, {"introduction": "Calculating indices by tracking vector rotation can be tedious.
