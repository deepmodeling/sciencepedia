The Euler characteristic is a topological invariant. For a surface decomposed into a cell complex with $V$ vertices, $E$ edges, and $F$ faces, it is given by $\\chi = V - E + F$. A crucial property for our purpose is its behavior under gluing. If a space $X$ is formed by gluing two spaces $A$ and $B$ along a common subspace $C = A \\cap B$, the Euler characteristic of $X$ is given by the inclusion-exclusion principle: $\\chi(X) = \\chi(A) + \\chi(B) - \\chi(C)$.\n\nLet's analyze the construction step-by-step.\nLet $S$ be the initial 2-sphere. Its Euler characteristic is well-known to be $\\chi(S) = 2$.\nIn Step 1, we remove the interiors of two disjoint closed disks, let's call them $D_1$ and $D_2$. The resulting surface is the punctured sphere, let's call it $S_p$. The original sphere $S$ can be reconstructed by gluing the disks $D_1$ and $D_2$ back onto $S_p$ along their boundaries. The boundary of $S_p$ is two disjoint circles, which are the boundaries of the removed disks, $\\partial D_1$ and $\\partial D_2$.\nA disk is topologically equivalent to a point (it is contractible), so its Euler characteristic is $\\chi(D_1) = \\chi(D_2) = 1$. The union of the two disjoint disks $D_1 \\cup D_2$ has $\\chi(D_1 \\cup D_2) = \\chi(D_1) + \\chi(D_2) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\nThe boundary of each disk is a circle, $S^1$. The Euler characteristic of a circle is $\\chi(S^1)=0$. The gluing interface consists of two disjoint circles, so its Euler characteristic is $\\chi(\\partial D_1 \\cup \\partial D_2) = \\chi(\\partial D_1) + \\chi(\\partial D_2) = 0 + 0 = 0$.\nNow we can find the Euler characteristic of the punctured sphere $S_p$ using the gluing formula for $S = S_p \\cup (D_1 \\cup D_2)$:\n$\\chi(S) = \\chi(S_p) + \\chi(D_1 \\cup D_2) - \\chi(S_p \\cap (D_1 \\cup D_2))$\nThe intersection is the boundary along which they are glued, so $S_p \\cap (D_1 \\cup D_2) = \\partial D_1 \\cup \\partial D_2$.\n$2 = \\chi(S_p) + 2 - 0$.\nFrom this, we deduce that the Euler characteristic of the punctured sphere is $\\chi(S_p) = 0$.\n\nIn Step 2, we introduce a finite cylinder, let's call it $C$. A cylinder is homotopy equivalent to a circle $S^1$. Therefore, its Euler characteristic is the same as that of a circle: $\\chi(C) = \\chi(S^1) = 0$. The boundary of the cylinder consists of two disjoint circles.\n\nIn Step 3, we glue the punctured sphere $S_p$ and the cylinder $C$ together to form the final surface, let's call it $M$. The gluing happens along their boundaries. The boundary of $S_p$ is two circles, and the boundary of $C$ is two circles. Let's call the total boundary region $B$. $B$ consists of two disjoint circles, so $\\chi(B) = 0$.\nUsing the gluing formula for $M = S_p \\cup C$:\n$\\chi(M) = \\chi(S_p) + \\chi(C) - \\chi(B)$\n$\\chi(M) = 0 + 0 - 0 = 0$.\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the final surface is 0.\n\nNext, we determine the orientability of $M$. The initial sphere is an orientable surface. Removing disks from it does not change its orientability, so $S_p$ is an orientable surface with boundary. The cylinder is also an orientable surface with boundary. When two orientable surfaces are glued along their boundaries, the resulting surface is also orientable (assuming a standard orientation-matching gluing, which is implicit in the construction of a manifold). Thus, the final surface $M$ is orientable.\n\nWe now have a compact, connected, orientable surface $M$ with $\\chi(M)=0$. The classification theorem for compact, orientable surfaces states that any such surface is a sphere with $g$ handles (a surface of genus $g$), and its Euler characteristic is given by the formula $\\chi = 2 - 2g$.\nFor our surface $M$, we have:\n$0 = 2 - 2g$\nThis implies $2g = 2$, so the genus is $g=1$.\n\nA compact, orientable surface of genus 1 is a torus.\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA. The sphere: Genus $g=0$, orientable, $\\chi = 2$.\nB. The torus: Genus $g=1$, orientable, $\\chi = 0$. This matches our result.\nC. The Klein bottle: Non-orientable, $\\chi = 0$.
