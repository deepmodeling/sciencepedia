Two standard criteria we will use are:\n1) If $S$ is a graph $z=f(x,y)$ of a smooth function $f:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\to \\mathbb{R}$, then $X(u,v)=(u,v,f(u,v))$ has $X_{u}=(1,0,f_{u})$ and $X_{v}=(0,1,f_{v})$, which are linearly independent everywhere (their cross product never vanishes), so $S$ is a regular surface.\n2) If $S=F^{-1}(0)$ for a smooth $F:\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\to \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\nabla F\\neq 0$ at all points of $S$, then by the implicit function theorem $S$ is a regular surface.

At points along the lines where two planes intersect (e.g., the $z$-axis with $x=y=0$) and at the origin where all three meet, any neighborhood in $S_{C}$ is a union of multiple sheets meeting along a line or at a point, which is not locally homeomorphic to an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.
