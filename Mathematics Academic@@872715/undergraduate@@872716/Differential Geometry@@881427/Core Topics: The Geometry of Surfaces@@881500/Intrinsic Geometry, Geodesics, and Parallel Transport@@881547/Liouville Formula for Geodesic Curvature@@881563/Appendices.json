We will address these conditions step-by-step.\n\nFirst, we analyze the condition that all curves of the form $v=u+c$ are geodesics. A curve is a geodesic if and only if its geodesic curvature $\\kappa_g$ is zero everywhere along the curve. For a surface with an orthogonal metric ($F=0$) where $E=G=\\lambda$, Liouville's formula for geodesic curvature of a curve $\\alpha(s)=(u(s), v(s))$ parametrized by arc length $s$ is:\n$$ \\kappa_g = \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial u} \\frac{dv}{ds} - \\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial v} \\frac{du}{ds} \\right) + \\frac{d\\theta}{ds} $$\nHere, $\\theta$ is the angle between the curve's tangent vector and the positive $u$-direction (tangent to the $u$-curves).\n\nLet's consider the family of curves $v=u+c$. We can parameterize a curve from this family using $u$ as the parameter, so $\\alpha(u) = (u, u+c)$. The tangent vector in the $(u,v)$ coordinate system is $\\alpha'(u) = (1, 1)$. The arc-length element $ds$ is given by:\n$$ ds^2 = \\lambda(du^2 + dv^2) $$\nSince $dv=du$ along the curve, we have $ds^2 = \\lambda(du^2 + du^2) = 2\\lambda du^2$. This implies $ds = \\sqrt{2\\lambda}du$.\nThe derivatives with respect to arc length are:\n$$ \\frac{du}{ds} = \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{2\\lambda}du} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\lambda}} $$\n$$ \\frac{dv}{ds} = \\frac{dv}{du} \\frac{du}{ds} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\lambda}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\lambda}} $$\nThe angle $\\theta$ is given by the dot product (using the metric) between the curve's unit tangent vector and the unit tangent vector of a $u$-curve. The tangent vector to a $u$-curve (where $v$ is constant) is proportional to $(1,0)$. The tangent vector to our curve is proportional to $(1,1)$.\n$$ \\cos\\theta = \\frac{g((1,1), (1,0))}{\\| (1,1) \\|_g \\|(1,0)\\|_g} = \\frac{\\lambda(1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 0)}{\\sqrt{\\lambda(1^2+1^2)}\\sqrt{\\lambda(1^2+0^2)}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\sqrt{2\\lambda}\\sqrt{\\lambda}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\nThus, $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, which is a constant along any curve of the family. Therefore, $\\frac{d\\theta}{ds} = 0$.\n\nNow, we substitute these results into Liouville's formula for $\\kappa_g$:\n$$ \\kappa_g = \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial u} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\lambda}} - \\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial v} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\lambda}} \\right) + 0 = \\frac{1}{2\\lambda\\sqrt{2\\lambda}} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial u} - \\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial v} \\right) $$\nThe condition that these curves are geodesics means $\\kappa_g = 0$.

The method of characteristics shows that the solution $\\lambda$ must be constant along lines where $u+v$ is constant. This means $\\lambda$ must be a function of the sum $u+v$. So, we can write $\\lambda(u,v) = f(u+v)$ for some single-variable function $f$.\n\nNext, we use the second condition: the surface has constant Gaussian curvature $K=-1$.
