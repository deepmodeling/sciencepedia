The definition of curvature is given as:\n$$\n\\kappa(t) = \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{T}'(t)\\|}{\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\|}\n$$\nThe curve is described as regular, which implies that its tangent vector $\\mathbf{r}'(t)$ is never the zero vector. Consequently, the speed, $\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\|$, is strictly positive.\n\nFor the fraction defining $\\kappa(t)$ to be zero, the numerator must be zero.\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{T}'(t)\\| = 0\n$$\nThe norm of a vector is zero if and only if the vector itself is the zero vector. Therefore, the derivative of the unit tangent vector must be the zero vector for all $t$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{T}'(t) = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nIntegrating this equation with respect to $t$, we find that the unit tangent vector $\\mathbf{T}(t)$ must be a constant vector. Let's call this constant vector $\\mathbf{T}_0$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{T}(t) = \\mathbf{T}_0\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{T}(t)$ is a unit vector for all $t$, $\\mathbf{T}_0$ must also be a unit vector, i.e., $\\|\\mathbf{T}_0\\| = 1$.\n\nNow, we relate this back to the curve's parametrization $\\mathbf{r}(t)$. The definition of the unit tangent vector is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{T}(t) = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}'(t)}{\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\|}\n$$\nSubstituting our result $\\mathbf{T}(t) = \\mathbf{T}_0$, we get:\n$$\n\\mathbf{T}_0 = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}'(t)}{\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\|}\n$$\nLet the speed be $v(t) = \\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\|$. Then we can write:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}'(t) = v(t) \\mathbf{T}_0\n$$\nTo find the curve $\\mathbf{r}(t)$, we integrate $\\mathbf{r}'(t)$ with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}(t) = \\int \\mathbf{r}'(t) dt = \\int v(t) \\mathbf{T}_0 dt\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{T}_0$ is a constant vector, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}(t) = \\mathbf{T}_0 \\int v(t) dt + \\mathbf{C}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{C}$ is a constant vector of integration. Let $s(t) = \\int v(t) dt$. The function $s(t)$ is a scalar function of $t$. The equation for the curve becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}(t) = s(t) \\mathbf{T}_0 + \\mathbf{C}\n$$\nThis is the vector parametric equation for a straight line. The line passes through the point defined by the position vector $\\mathbf{C}$ and is parallel to the constant direction vector $\\mathbf{T}_0$.\n\nThus, the condition of zero curvature forces the curve to be a straight line.\n\nNow, we must check if this result is consistent with the second property, that the curve is a generalized helix. A curve is a generalized helix if its tangent vector $\\mathbf{T}(t)$ makes a constant angle with a fixed vector $\\mathbf{u}$. This is equivalent to the condition that $\\mathbf{T}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{u}$ is constant.\n\nFor our straight line, the unit tangent vector is the constant vector $\\mathbf{T}_0$. We need to show there exists a fixed vector $\\mathbf{u}$ such that $\\mathbf{T}_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{u}$ is constant. This is trivially true; we can choose any constant vector for $\\mathbf{u}$. For example, we can choose the fixed vector $\\mathbf{u}$ to be $\\mathbf{T}_0$ itself (which is non-zero because it's a unit vector). Then the dot product is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{T}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{T}_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{T}_0 = \\|\\mathbf{T}_0\\|^2 = 1^2 = 1\n$$\nSince the dot product is a constant (1), the angle between $\\mathbf{T}(t)$ and $\\mathbf{u}$ is also constant ($\\theta = \\arccos(1) = 0$). Therefore, a straight line satisfies the definition of a generalized helix.\n\nBoth given properties are satisfied if and only if the curve is a straight line. Other options like circles, ellipses, and parabolas have non-zero curvature. A circular helix has constant non-zero curvature.\n\nThe correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1643529"}]}
