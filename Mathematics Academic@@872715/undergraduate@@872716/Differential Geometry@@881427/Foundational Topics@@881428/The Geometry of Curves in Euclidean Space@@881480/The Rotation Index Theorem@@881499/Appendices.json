This relation is a standard result in the differential geometry of plane curves.\n\nThe total change in $\\phi$ as $\\theta$ goes from $0$ to $2\\pi$ is the sum of the total changes in $\\theta$ and $\\psi$:\n$\\Delta\\phi = \\Delta\\theta + \\Delta\\psi$\nThe total change in $\\theta$ is simply $\\Delta\\theta = 2\\pi - 0 = 2\\pi$.\n\nThe rotation index is therefore $I = \\frac{\\Delta\\phi}{2\\pi} = \\frac{2\\pi + \\Delta\\psi}{2\\pi} = 1 + \\frac{\\Delta\\psi}{2\\pi}$.\n\nNow we need to find $\\Delta\\psi$.
