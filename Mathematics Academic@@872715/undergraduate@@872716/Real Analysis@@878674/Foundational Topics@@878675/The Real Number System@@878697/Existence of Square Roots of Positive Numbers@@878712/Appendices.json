This proof relies on the Completeness Axiom, which distinguishes the real numbers from the rationals. This exercise guides you through the canonical proof, where you will use the concept of the supremum of a set to demonstrate rigorously that a number like $\\sqrt{13}$ must exist within the real number system. [@problem_id:1299079]", "problem": "In the field of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$, the Completeness Axiom states that every non-empty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound (supremum) in $\\mathbb{R}$. Consider a specific set $A$, which is a subset of the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, defined as:\n$$A = \\left\\{ x \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid x \\geq 0 \\text{ and } x^2  13 \\right\\}$$\nRegarding $A$ as a set of real numbers, determine the value of its supremum.", "solution": "Let the given set be $A = \\left\\{ x \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid x \\geq 0 \\text{ and } x^2  13 \\right\\}$. We want to find $s = \\sup A$, where the supremum is taken in the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the existence of the supremum using the Completeness Axiom.\n1.  The set $A$ is non-empty. For instance, the rational number $3$ satisfies $3 \\ge 0$ and $3^2 = 9  13$. Thus, $3 \\in A$.\n2.  The set $A$ is bounded above. Consider the number $4$. For any $x \\in A$, we have $x^2  13$. If we were to assume there exists an $x \\in A$ such that $x \\geq 4$, then it would follow that $x^2 \\geq 4^2 = 16$. This contradicts the condition $x^2  13$. Therefore, every element $x \\in A$ must satisfy $x  4$, which means $4$ is an upper bound for $A$.\n\nSince $A$ is a non-empty subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above, the Completeness Axiom guarantees that its supremum, $s = \\sup A$, exists as a real number.\n\nNext, we determine the precise value of $s$. Since $3 \\in A$, we know $s \\ge 3  0$. By the law of trichotomy for real numbers, exactly one of the following must be true: $s^2  13$, $s^2  13$, or $s^2 = 13$. We will eliminate the first two possibilities.\n\nCase 1: Assume $s^2  13$.\nLet $\\delta = 13 - s^2$. Since we assumed $s^2  13$, we have $\\delta  0$. Our goal is to find a rational number $q \\in A$ such that $q  s$. This would contradict the fact that $s$ is an upper bound for $A$.\nConsider the number $s+h$ for some small $h0$. We have $(s+h)^2 = s^2 + 2sh + h^2$. To simplify, we can choose $h1$, which implies $h^2  h$.\nThen $(s+h)^2  s^2 + 2sh + h = s^2 + h(2s+1)$.\nWe want to find an $h$ such that this expression is less than 13. That is, we want $s^2 + h(2s+1)  13$, which simplifies to $h(2s+1)  13 - s^2 = \\delta$. This is satisfied if $h  \\frac{\\delta}{2s+1}$.\nBy the Archimedean property, we can find a natural number $n$ such that $\\frac{1}{n}  \\frac{\\delta}{2s+1}$. Let's choose such an $n$. With $h = 1/n$, we have $(s+1/n)^2  13$.\nThe number $s+1/n$ is a real number greater than $s$. By the density of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, there exists a rational number $q$ such that $s  q  s+1/n$.\nSince $q  s  0$, we have $q \\ge 0$. Also, since the function $f(x)=x^2$ is increasing for positive numbers, $q^2  (s+1/n)^2  13$.\nSo, $q$ is a rational number with $q \\ge 0$ and $q^2  13$. By definition, $q \\in A$.\nHowever, we found $q  s$, which contradicts $s$ being an upper bound for A. Thus, the assumption $s^2  13$ must be false.\n\nCase 2: Assume $s^2  13$.\nLet $\\eta = s^2 - 13$. Since we assumed $s^2  13$, we have $\\eta  0$. Our goal is to find an upper bound for $A$ that is smaller than $s$. This would contradict the fact that $s$ is the *least* upper bound.\nConsider the number $s-h$ for some small $h  0$. We have $(s-h)^2 = s^2 - 2sh + h^2$. Since $h^2  0$, we have $(s-h)^2  s^2 - 2sh$.\nWe want to find an $h$ such that $s^2-2sh  13$. This is equivalent to $s^2 - 13  2sh$, or $\\eta  2sh$. This is satisfied if $h  \\frac{\\eta}{2s}$.\nBy the Archimedean property, we can find a natural number $n$ such that $\\frac{1}{n}  \\frac{\\eta}{2s}$. Let's choose such an $n$. With $h=1/n$, we have $(s-1/n)^2  s^2 - \\frac{2s}{n}  s^2 - 2s\\left(\\frac{\\eta}{2s}\\right) = s^2 - \\eta = s^2 - (s^2 - 13) = 13$.\nSo, $(s-1/n)^2  13$. Let $u = s-1/n$. We can choose $n$ large enough so that $u0$ (since $s  0$).\nFor any $x \\in A$, we have $x \\ge 0$ and $x^2  13$. Since $u^2  13$, we have $x^2  u^2$. As both $x$ and $u$ are non-negative, this implies $x  u$.\nThis shows that $u = s-1/n$ is an upper bound for the set $A$. But $u  s$, which contradicts the fact that $s$ is the least upper bound. Thus, the assumption $s^2  13$ must be false.\n\nSince we have shown that $s^2  13$ and $s^2  13$ are both false, the only remaining possibility by the law of trichotomy is $s^2 = 13$.\nSince the elements of $A$ are non-negative, their supremum $s$ must also be non-negative. Therefore, $s$ is the unique non-negative real number whose square is 13. By definition, this number is the square root of 13.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{13}}$$", "id": "1299079"}, {"introduction": "Beyond proving that square roots exist, we can construct algorithms to approximate them to any desired accuracy.
