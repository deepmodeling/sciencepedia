The rationality of $\\beta$ depends on the specific choice of the irrational number $\\alpha$ in a way not described by the other options.", "solution": "The core principle we will use is that a real number is rational if and only if its decimal expansion is eventually periodic. An eventually periodic decimal expansion is one for which, after some number of digits, the sequence of digits repeats in a fixed-length cycle.\n\nTo determine the rationality of $\\beta$, we will analyze its decimal expansion. We will proceed by contradiction. Let us assume that $\\beta$ is a rational number.\n\nIf $\\beta$ is rational, its decimal expansion must be eventually periodic. This means there exist two integers, a pre-period length $N \\ge 0$ and a period length $p \\ge 1$, such that for any digit position $k > N$, the digit of $\\beta$ at that position, which we will call $c_k$, satisfies the relation $c_{k+p} = c_k$.\n\nThe decimal expansion of $\\beta$ is constructed by concatenating the blocks $S_1, S_2, S_3, \\dots$, where $S_n = d_1d_2\\dots d_n$ is the block of the first $n$ digits of the irrational number $\\alpha$. The length of the block $S_n$ is $n$.\n\nLet's find the position in $\\beta$'s expansion where a given block $S_m$ begins. The total number of digits preceding the block $S_m$ is the sum of the lengths of all prior blocks $S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_{m-1}$. Let this starting position index (just before the first digit of $S_m$) be $L_m$.\n$$ L_m = \\sum_{n=1}^{m-1} \\text{length}(S_n) = \\sum_{n=1}^{m-1} n = \\frac{(m-1)m}{2} $$\nThe digits of $\\beta$ from position $L_m+1$ to $L_m+m$ are given by the block $S_m$. That is, for $1 \\le j \\le m$, the digit $c_{L_m+j}$ of $\\beta$ is equal to the digit $d_j$ of $\\alpha$.\n\nOur assumption is that $\\beta$ is eventually periodic with period $p$ after the $N$-th digit. We want to show this leads to a contradiction with the fact that $\\alpha$ is irrational.\n\nLet's pick an arbitrary positive integer $j_0$. Our goal is to see if the sequence $d_1, d_2, \\dots$ has a periodic structure. Specifically, we will show that our assumption implies $d_{j_0} = d_{j_0+p}$.\n\nSince the sum $L_m = \\frac{m(m-1)}{2}$ grows quadratically with $m$, we can always find an integer $m$ large enough such that two conditions are met:\n1. The block $S_m$ is long enough to contain the digits we are interested in. Specifically, we choose $m$ such that $m > j_0 + p$.\n2. The block $S_m$ is located far enough into the expansion of $\\beta$ to be entirely within its periodic part. Specifically, we choose $m$ such that the starting position $L_m+1$ is greater than the pre-period length $N$. So, $L_m > N$.\n\nWith such an $m$ chosen, let us examine the digits of $\\beta$ within the block $S_m$. Consider the position $k = L_m + j_0$. Since we chose $m$ such that $L_m > N$, we have $k > N$. Therefore, this position is within the periodic part of $\\beta$'s expansion. The digit at this position is $c_k = c_{L_m+j_0}$, which by construction is $d_{j_0}$.\n\nAccording to our periodicity assumption for $\\beta$, the digit at position $k+p$ must be the same as the digit at position $k$. So, $c_{k+p} = c_k = d_{j_0}$.\n\nThe position $k+p$ is $L_m + j_0 + p$. Since we chose $m > j_0 + p$, the index $j_0+p$ is less than $m$. This means the position $L_m + j_0 + p$ is still within the block $S_m$. The digit at this position, $c_{L_m + (j_0+p)}$, is by construction equal to $d_{j_0+p}$.\n\nSo we have two expressions for $c_{k+p}$:\n1. From periodicity: $c_{k+p} = d_{j_0}$\n2. From construction: $c_{k+p} = d_{j_0+p}$\n\nEquating these gives $d_{j_0} = d_{j_0+p}$.\n\nThis reasoning holds for any arbitrary positive integer $j_0$ we might have chosen. Therefore, the sequence of digits $d_1, d_2, d_3, \\dots$ of the number $\\alpha$ must be periodic with period $p$. (More precisely, it is periodic from the first digit).\n\nA number whose decimal expansion is periodic is a rational number. This implies that $\\alpha$ must be rational. However, this is a direct contradiction of the problem's initial premise that $\\alpha$ is an irrational number.\n\nSince our initial assumption (that $\\beta$ is rational) leads to a contradiction, the assumption must be false. Therefore, $\\beta$ must be an irrational number. This conclusion does not depend on which irrational number $\\alpha$ was chosen. It holds true for any irrational $\\alpha$.\n\nThus, the statement \"$\\beta$ is always an irrational number\" is the correct one.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1315352"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice delves into the statistical properties of decimal digits, probing a deeper level of structure.

We will analyze the two implications, P $\\implies$ Q and Q $\\implies$ P, separately.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of P $\\implies$ Q**\n\nStatement P is \"The number $x$ is a rational number.\" A fundamental property of rational numbers is that their decimal expansions are eventually periodic. This means that for any rational $x \\in [0,1]$, its decimal expansion can be written as:\n$$x = 0.d_1 d_2 \\dots d_{N_0} \\overline{p_1 p_2 \\dots p_L}$$\nHere, $d_1, \\dots, d_{N_0}$ is the non-repeating (pre-period) part of length $N_0 \\ge 0$, and $p_1, \\dots, p_L$ is the repeating (period) part of length $L \\ge 1$.\n\nLet's compute the limit of the arithmetic mean $A_n(x)$ for such a number.\nLet $S_{N_0} = \\sum_{k=1}^{N_0} d_k$ be the sum of the digits in the non-repeating part.\nLet $S_{L} = \\sum_{j=1}^{L} p_j$ be the sum of the digits in one cycle of the repeating part.\n\nFor any integer $n > N_0$, we can determine how many full repeating blocks are contained within the first $n$ digits. The number of digits after the pre-period is $n - N_0$. The number of full repeating blocks, $q$, and the number of remaining digits in the next block, $r$, are given by $n - N_0 = qL + r$, where $q$ is an integer and $0 \\le r  L$.\n\nThe sum of the first $n$ digits, $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} d_k$, can be expressed as the sum of digits from the pre-period, plus the sum of digits from the $q$ full periods, plus the sum of digits from the remaining $r$ digits of the next period.\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{n} d_k = S_{N_0} + q S_L + \\sum_{j=1}^{r} p_j$$\nThe arithmetic mean $A_n(x)$ is this sum divided by $n$:\n$$A_n(x) = \\frac{1}{n} \\left( S_{N_0} + q S_L + \\sum_{j=1}^{r} p_j \\right)$$\nFrom $n - N_0 = qL + r$, we can express $q$ as $q = \\frac{n - N_0 - r}{L}$.

Let's analyze the second term. All quantities inside the parenthesis are bounded. $S_{N_0}$, $N_0$, $S_L$, and $L$ are constants for a given rational number $x$. The variable $r$ is bounded by $0 \\le r  L$, which means the term $\\sum_{j=1}^{r} p_j$ is also bounded. Therefore, the entire expression inside the parenthesis is bounded by some constant $C$. The second term is of the form $C/n$.\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{C}{n} \\to 0$.\nThus, the limit of the arithmetic mean exists and is given by:\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} A_n(x) = \\frac{S_L}{L}$$\nThis is the average value of the digits in the repeating block.\nTherefore, if $x$ is rational, the sequence $\\{A_n(x)\\}$ converges.

We can test this by attempting to construct a counterexample: an irrational number $x$ for which the sequence $\\{A_n(x)\\}$ converges.\n\nLet's construct a number $x$ by concatenating blocks of digits. Let the $k$-th block, $B_k$, consist of $k$ ones followed by $k$ zeros.\n$B_1 = 10$\n$B_2 = 1100$\n$B_3 = 111000$\n...\n$B_k = \\underbrace{11\\dots1}_{k \\text{ times}}\\underbrace{00\\dots0}_{k \\text{ times}}$\n\nOur number $x$ is formed by concatenating these blocks:\n$$x = 0.B_1 B_2 B_3 \\dots = 0.101100111000\\dots$$\nSince the sequence of digits is not eventually periodic (the blocks of zeros and ones grow in length), the number $x$ is irrational. Now we need to check if $\\{A_n(x)\\}$ converges.\n\nLet's analyze the mean $A_n(x)$ at specific points. Let $N_k$ be the total number of digits at the end of block $B_k$. The length of block $B_j$ is $2j$.\n$N_k = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} (\\text{length of } B_j) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} 2j = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^{k} j = 2 \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} = k(k+1)$.\n\nLet $S_k$ be the sum of digits up to the end of block $B_k$. The sum of digits in block $B_j$ is $j$ (since it contains $j$ ones).\n$S_k = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} (\\text{sum of digits in } B_j) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} j = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$.\n\nThe arithmetic mean at the end of block $B_k$ is:\n$$A_{N_k}(x) = \\frac{S_k}{N_k} = \\frac{k(k+1)/2}{k(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis shows that there is a subsequence of the means $\\{A_{N_k}(x)\\}$ that converges to $1/2$. To prove the entire sequence converges, we must show that the mean $A_n(x)$ is close to $1/2$ for all large $n$.\n\nLet $n$ be a large integer. There must be some $k$ such that $N_{k-1}  n \\le N_k$. This means the $n$-th digit lies within the block $B_k$. Let $n = N_{k-1} + m$, where $1 \\le m \\le 2k$.\nThe total sum of digits up to $n$ is the sum up to $N_{k-1}$ plus the sum of the first $m$ digits of block $B_k$.\n$\\sum_{i=1}^n d_i = S_{k-1} + (\\text{sum of first } m \\text{ digits of } B_k)$.\n\nThere are two cases for the position $m$ within block $B_k$:\nCase 1: $1 \\le m \\le k$. The first $k$ digits of $B_k$ are all 1s.\nThe sum of digits is $S_{k-1} + m = \\frac{(k-1)k}{2} + m$.\nThe mean is $A_n(x) = \\frac{\\frac{(k-1)k}{2} + m}{(k-1)k + m}$.\nAs $k \\to \\infty$ (and thus $n \\to \\infty$), the dominant term in both numerator and denominator is $k^2$. The expression is approximately $\\frac{k^2/2}{k^2} = 1/2$. More rigorously, we can bound it:\nFor $m=1$: $A_n = \\frac{k(k-1)/2 + 1}{k(k-1)+1} = \\frac{k^2-k+2}{2k^2-2k+2} \\to \\frac{1}{2}$ as $k \\to \\infty$.\nFor $m=k$: $A_n = \\frac{k(k-1)/2 + k}{k(k-1)+k} = \\frac{k^2+k}{2k^2} = \\frac{k+1}{2k} \\to \\frac{1}{2}$ as $k \\to \\infty$.\nFor any $m$ in between, the value of $A_n(x)$ is between these two extremes, both of which approach $1/2$.\n\nCase 2: $k  m \\le 2k$. The first $k$ digits of $B_k$ are 1s, and the subsequent digits are 0s. The sum of the first $m$ digits of $B_k$ is just $k$.\nThe sum of digits is $S_{k-1} + k = \\frac{(k-1)k}{2} + k = \\frac{k^2+k}{2} = S_k$.\nThe mean is $A_n(x) = \\frac{S_k}{N_{k-1} + m} = \\frac{k(k+1)/2}{k(k-1) + m}$.\nThe denominator ranges from $k(k-1)+k+1 = k^2+1$ to $k(k-1)+2k = k^2+k$.\nThe value of $A_n(x)$ is bounded:\n$\\frac{k(k+1)/2}{k^2+k} \\le A_n(x) \\le \\frac{k(k+1)/2}{k^2+1}$.\nThe lower bound is $\\frac{k(k+1)}{2(k^2+k)} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe upper bound is $\\frac{k^2+k}{2k^2+2} \\to \\frac{1}{2}$ as $k \\to \\infty$.\nBy the Squeeze Theorem, in this case as well, $A_n(x) \\to 1/2$.\n\nSince for any large $n$, $A_n(x)$ is squeezed between values that approach $1/2$, we conclude that $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} A_n(x) = 1/2$.\nWe have constructed an irrational number $x$ for which Statement Q is true. Therefore, Q does not imply P.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe have shown that P $\\implies$ Q is true, but Q $\\implies$ P is false.
