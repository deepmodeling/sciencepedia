We want to find $\\inf A$ and $\\sup A$.\n\nFirst, let's establish the bounds for the elements of $A$. Let $x = \\frac{m}{m+n}$ be an arbitrary element of $A$. Since $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, $m > 0$ and $n > 0$.\nThe numerator $m$ is positive, and the denominator $m+n$ is also positive. Therefore, any element $x$ in $A$ must be positive: $x > 0$. This means that $0$ is a lower bound for the set $A$.\n\nAlso, since $n > 0$, we have $m  m+n$. As both sides are positive, we can divide by $m+n$ without changing the inequality direction:\n$$ \\frac{m}{m+n}  \\frac{m+n}{m+n} $$\n$$ x  1 $$\nThis shows that $1$ is an upper bound for the set $A$.\nSince the set $A$ is bounded below by $0$ and bounded above by $1$, both its infimum and supremum exist by the completeness axiom of real numbers.\n\nNow we will prove that $\\inf A = 0$.\nWe have already shown that $0$ is a lower bound. To show it is the greatest lower bound (infimum), we must show that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an element $x \\in A$ such that $x  0 + \\epsilon$.\nLet's choose an arbitrary $\\epsilon > 0$. We need to find $m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\frac{m}{m+n}  \\epsilon$.\nLet's fix $m=1$. The inequality becomes $\\frac{1}{1+n}  \\epsilon$.\nThis is equivalent to $1  \\epsilon(1+n)$, or $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}  1+n$, which simplifies to $n > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1$.\nBy the Archimedean property, for any real number (like $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1$), there exists a natural number $n$ that is greater. So, we can always find an $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ that satisfies this condition.\nFor such a choice of $m=1$ and $n$, the element $x = \\frac{1}{1+n}$ is in $A$ and satisfies $x  \\epsilon$.\nSince for any $\\epsilon > 0$, we can find an element of $A$ in the interval $(0, \\epsilon)$, and $0$ is a lower bound, it must be the greatest lower bound. Therefore, $\\inf A = 0$.\n\nNext, we will prove that $\\sup A = 1$.\nWe have already shown that $1$ is an upper bound. To show it is the least upper bound (supremum), we must show that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an element $x \\in A$ such that $x > 1 - \\epsilon$. (We only need to consider $0  \\epsilon  1$, otherwise $1-\\epsilon \\le 0$ and any element $x \\in A$ works as all elements are positive).\nLet's choose an arbitrary $\\epsilon$ such that $0  \\epsilon  1$. We need to find $m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\frac{m}{m+n} > 1-\\epsilon$.\nLet's fix $n=1$. The inequality becomes $\\frac{m}{m+1} > 1-\\epsilon$.\nSince $m+1 > 0$, we can multiply both sides by it:\n$m > (1-\\epsilon)(m+1)$\n$m > m + 1 - \\epsilon m - \\epsilon$\n$0 > 1 - \\epsilon m - \\epsilon$\n$\\epsilon m > 1 - \\epsilon$\n$m > \\frac{1-\\epsilon}{\\epsilon}$\n$m > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1$\nBy the Archimedean property, for any real number (like $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1$), there exists a natural number $m$ that is greater. So, we can always find an $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ that satisfies this condition.\nFor such a choice of $n=1$ and $m$, the element $x = \\frac{m}{m+1}$ is in $A$ and satisfies $x > 1 - \\epsilon$.\nSince for any $\\epsilon > 0$ we can find an element of $A$ in the interval $(1-\\epsilon, 1)$, and $1$ is an upper bound, it must be the least upper bound. Therefore, $\\sup A = 1$.\n\nThe infimum of $A$ is $0$ and the supremum of $A$ is $1$.

Determine the greatest lower bound (infimum) of the set $S$. Express your answer as a single closed-form analytic expression.", "solution": "The problem asks for the greatest lower bound, or infimum, of the set $S$. The set $S$ is defined as $S = \\{ q \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid q > 0 \\text{ and } q^2 - 2q > 4 \\}$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the inequality $q^2 - 2q > 4$. To do this, let's consider the corresponding equation in the real numbers, $x^2 - 2x - 4 = 0$. We can find the roots of this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\nFor this equation, we have $a=1$, $b=-2$, and $c=-4$. Substituting these values into the formula gives:\n$$ x = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(1)(-4)}}{2(1)} $$\n$$ x = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 16}}{2} $$\n$$ x = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2} $$\nSince $\\sqrt{20} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 5} = 2\\sqrt{5}$, the roots are:\n$$ x = \\frac{2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}}{2} = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{5} $$\nSo the two real roots are $x_1 = 1 - \\sqrt{5}$ and $x_2 = 1 + \\sqrt{5}$.\n\nThe function $f(x) = x^2 - 2x - 4$ describes an upward-opening parabola. The inequality $x^2 - 2x - 4 > 0$ is satisfied when $x$ is outside the interval defined by the roots. That is, the inequality holds for $x  1 - \\sqrt{5}$ or $x > 1 + \\sqrt{5}$.\n\nNow, we must apply this to the definition of the set $S$, which requires its elements $q$ to be rational numbers ($q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$) and also to be positive ($q > 0$).\nLet's analyze the two roots. We know that $2  \\sqrt{5}  3$.\nThe first root is $x_1 = 1 - \\sqrt{5}$. Since $\\sqrt{5} > 2$, this root is negative. Specifically, $1-3  1-\\sqrt{5}  1-2$, so $-2  1-\\sqrt{5}  -1$.\nThe second root is $x_2 = 1 + \\sqrt{5}$. Since $\\sqrt{5} > 2$, this root is positive. Specifically, $1+2  1+\\sqrt{5}  1+3$, so $3  1+\\sqrt{5}  4$.\n\nThe conditions for a rational number $q$ to be in $S$ are:\n1. $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$\n2. $q > 0$\n3. $q  1 - \\sqrt{5}$ or $q > 1 + \\sqrt{5}$\n\nLet's combine conditions 2 and 3.\nThe branch $q  1 - \\sqrt{5}$ requires $q$ to be a negative number, which contradicts the condition $q > 0$. Thus, there are no elements in $S$ from this branch.\nThe branch $q > 1 + \\sqrt{5}$ is compatible with $q > 0$, since $1 + \\sqrt{5}$ is a positive number.\n\nTherefore, the definition of the set $S$ simplifies to:\n$$ S = \\{ q \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid q > 1 + \\sqrt{5} \\} $$\nThis means $S$ is the set of all rational numbers that are strictly greater than the irrational number $1 + \\sqrt{5}$.\n\nWe are looking for the infimum of $S$, denoted $\\inf(S)$.\nLet $\\alpha = 1 + \\sqrt{5}$. By the definition of $S$, for any element $s \\in S$, we have $s > \\alpha$. This means $\\alpha$ is a lower bound for the set $S$.\n\nTo show that $\\alpha$ is the *greatest* lower bound, we must show that any number larger than $\\alpha$ is not a lower bound.\nLet $M$ be any real number such that $M > \\alpha$. There is a positive distance between $\\alpha$ and $M$. By the property of the density of rational numbers in the real numbers, for any two distinct real numbers, there is a rational number between them. Thus, we can find a rational number $q'$ such that $\\alpha  q'  M$.\nSince $q' > \\alpha = 1 + \\sqrt{5}$ and $q'$ is rational, $q'$ is an element of $S$.\nBecause we found an element $q' \\in S$ such that $q'  M$, $M$ cannot be a lower bound for $S$.\nThis holds for any number $M$ greater than $\\alpha$.
