Square both sides of the desired equality and compare:\n$$\n|x-y|^2=x^2-2xy+y^2,\\qquad ||x|-|y||^2=|x|^2-2|x||y|+|y|^2=x^2-2xy+y^2.\n$$\nTherefore $|x-y|^2=||x|-|y||^2$, and since both sides are nonnegative, it follows that\n$$\n|x-y|=||x|-|y||.\n$$\nThus Statement 2 implies Statement 4.\n\nConversely, assume $|x-y|=||x|-|y||$.
