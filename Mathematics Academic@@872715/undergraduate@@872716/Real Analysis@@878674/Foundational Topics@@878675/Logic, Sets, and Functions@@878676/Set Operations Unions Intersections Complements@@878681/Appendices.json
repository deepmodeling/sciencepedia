We will analyze each option by first determining its set of limit points $S'$ and then evaluating the intersection $S \\cap S'$.\n\nA. $S = (0, 1)$.\nLet $p$ be any point in the closed interval $[0, 1]$. Any open interval $I$ containing $p$ will overlap with $(0, 1)$. Specifically, if $p \\in (0, 1)$, the interval $I$ itself must contain other points of $(0,1)$. If $p=0$ or $p=1$, any open interval around $p$ will also contain points from $(0,1)$. For example, for $p=0$, an interval $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ for $\\epsilon > 0$ will contain points from $(0, \\epsilon) \\subset (0,1)$. Thus, every point in the closed interval $[0,1]$ is a limit point of $S$. The set of limit points is $S' = [0, 1]$.\nThe intersection is $S \\cap S' = (0, 1) \\cap [0, 1] = (0, 1)$. This is not the empty set. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nB. $S = \\{1/n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}, n \\ge 1\\} \\cup \\{0\\}$.\nThis set consists of the points $\\{1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, \\dots, 0\\}$. The sequence of points $1/n$ converges to $0$ as $n \\to \\infty$. This means that for any open interval $I$ containing $0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $n > N$, $1/n \\in I$. Thus, $0$ is a limit point. Are there any other limit points? Any point $p = 1/k$ in the set (for $k \\ge 1$) is an isolated point. For example, for $p=1/k$, we can find a small neighborhood around it, like $( \\frac{1}{k} - \\delta, \\frac{1}{k} + \\delta)$, that contains no other point of the set. The distance to the nearest neighbors $1/(k-1)$ and $1/(k+1)$ is non-zero. A point not in the sequence and not $0$ also cannot be a limit point. Therefore, the set of limit points is $S' = \\{0\\}$.\nThe intersection is $S \\cap S' = (\\{1/n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}, n \\ge 1\\} \\cup \\{0\\}) \\cap \\{0\\} = \\{0\\}$. This is not the empty set. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\nC. $S = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe set of rational numbers is dense in the set of real numbers. This means that for any real number $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and any open interval $I$ containing $p$, the interval $I$ must contain a rational number other than $p$. Thus, every real number is a limit point of $\\mathbb{Q}$. The set of limit points is $S' = \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe intersection is $S \\cap S' = \\mathbb{Q} \\cap \\mathbb{R} = \\mathbb{Q}$. This is not the empty set. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nD. $S = \\mathbb{Z} = \\{\\dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\nThe set of integers consists entirely of isolated points. For any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, consider the open interval $I = (k-0.5, k+0.5)$. This interval contains $k$, but it contains no other integer. According to the definition of a limit point, for $p$ to be a limit point, every open interval around $p$ must contain a point of $S$ *distinct from p*. For any integer $k$, the interval $(k-0.5, k+0.5)$ contains no point of $\\mathbb{Z}$ other than $k$. So, no integer is a limit point. If we pick a point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$ which is not an integer, we can always find a small enough interval around $p$ that contains no integers at all. Thus, the set of limit points is the empty set: $S' = \\emptyset$.\nThe intersection is $S \\cap S' = \\mathbb{Z} \\cap \\emptyset = \\emptyset$. This satisfies the condition. Therefore, option D is correct.\n\nE. $S = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid x^{2} < 2\\}$.\nThis is the set of rational numbers in the open interval $(-\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{2})$. Let $p$ be any real number in the closed interval $[-\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{2}]$. Any open interval $I$ around $p$ contains both rational and irrational numbers. Therefore, any such interval $I$ contains a rational number from the set $S$ (which is not $p$ itself, as we can always find another rational number arbitrarily close). Thus, every point in the closed interval $[-\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{2}]$ is a limit point. The set of limit points is $S' = [-\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{2}]$.\nThe intersection is $S \\cap S' = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid x^{2} < 2\\} \\cap [-\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{2}] = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid x^{2} < 2\\} = S$. This is not the empty set.

A function is not monotonic if it has intervals of increase and intervals of decrease. For a differentiable function, this means its derivative must change sign.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**A. $f(x) = x^5 - 5x^3$**\nThis function is a polynomial. All polynomials are differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$, so $f \\in \\mathcal{D}$. To check for monotonicity, we find its derivative:\n$$f'(x) = 5x^4 - 15x^2 = 5x^2(x^2 - 3)$$\nThe sign of the derivative determines the function's behavior.\nFor $x=1$, $f'(1) = 5(1)^2(1^2 - 3) = -10 < 0$, so the function is decreasing.\nFor $x=2$, $f'(2) = 5(2)^2(2^2 - 3) = 20 > 0$, so the function is increasing.\nSince the derivative changes sign, the function is not monotonic on $\\mathbb{R}$, so $f \\in \\mathcal{M}^c$.\nTherefore, function A is an element of $\\mathcal{D} \\cap \\mathcal{M}^c$.\n\n**B. $f(x) = \\exp(-x^2)$**\nThis function is a composition of the exponential function and a polynomial, both of which are differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $f(x)$ is differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$, and $f \\in \\mathcal{D}$. We find the derivative using the chain rule:\n$$f'(x) = \\exp(-x^2) \\cdot (-2x) = -2x \\exp(-x^2)$$\nThe term $\\exp(-x^2)$ is always positive. The sign of $f'(x)$ is determined by the sign of $-2x$.\nFor $x < 0$ (e.g., $x=-1$), $f'(-1) = -2(-1)\\exp(-(-1)^2) = 2e^{-1} > 0$, so the function is increasing.\nFor $x > 0$ (e.g., $x=1$), $f'(1) = -2(1)\\exp(-(1)^2) = -2e^{-1} < 0$, so the function is decreasing.\nSince the derivative changes sign, the function is not monotonic on $\\mathbb{R}$, so $f \\in \\mathcal{M}^c$.\nTherefore, function B is an element of $\\mathcal{D} \\cap \\mathcal{M}^c$.\n\n**C. $f(x) = x^3 + 6x + 1$**\nThis is a polynomial, so it is differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$ ($f \\in \\mathcal{D}$). Its derivative is:\n$$f'(x) = 3x^2 + 6$$\nSince $x^2 \\ge 0$ for any real number $x$, $3x^2 \\ge 0$. This implies $f'(x) = 3x^2 + 6 \\ge 6$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe derivative is always positive, so the function is strictly increasing on $\\mathbb{R}$. A strictly increasing function is monotonic, so $f \\in \\mathcal{M}$. This means $f \\notin \\mathcal{M}^c$.\nTherefore, function C is not an element of $\\mathcal{D} \\cap \\mathcal{M}^c$.\n\n**D. $f(x) = |x^3|$**\nFor differentiability, we note that for $x \\neq 0$, the function is either $x^3$ or $-x^3$, which are differentiable. At $x=0$, we must check the definition of the derivative:\n$$ f'(0) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{|h^3|}{h} $$\nThe right-hand limit is $\\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{h^3}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} h^2 = 0$.\nThe left-hand limit is $\\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{-h^3}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^-} -h^2 = 0$.\nSince the left and right-hand limits of the difference quotient are equal, the function is differentiable at $x=0$. Thus, $f$ is differentiable on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, so $f \\in \\mathcal{D}$.\nFor monotonicity, consider the behavior of $f(x)$.\nFor $x > 0$, $f(x) = x^3$ is increasing.\nFor $x < 0$, $f(x) = -x^3$ is decreasing (e.g., $f(-2)=8$ and $f(-1)=1$).\nSince the function is decreasing on $(-\\infty, 0]$ and increasing on $[0, \\infty)$, it is not monotonic on $\\mathbb{R}$, so $f \\in \\mathcal{M}^c$.\nTherefore, function D is an element of $\\mathcal{D} \\cap \\mathcal{M}^c$.\n\n**E. $f(x) = 2x + \\cos(x)$**\nThis function is a sum of two functions that are differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$, so it is also differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$ ($f \\in \\mathcal{D}$). The derivative is:\n$$f'(x) = 2 - \\sin(x)$$\nThe sine function has a range of $[-1, 1]$. Therefore, the value of $f'(x)$ is always in the range $[2-1, 2-(-1)] = [1, 3]$.\nSince $f'(x) \\ge 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the derivative is always positive. The function is strictly increasing on $\\mathbb{R}$ and thus monotonic. So $f \\in \\mathcal{M}$, which means $f \\notin \\mathcal{M}^c$.\nTherefore, function E is not an element of $\\mathcal{D} \\cap \\mathcal{M}^c$.\n\nThe functions that satisfy both conditions are A, B, and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "1322830"}, {"introduction": "We now advance from static sets to the dynamic behavior of sequences of sets, a concept vital in fields like measure theory and probability.
