This exercise presents a flawed attempt at such a proof and challenges you to pinpoint the exact logical error, thereby solidifying your comprehension of the argument's scope and power [@problem_id:2289593].", "problem": "An undergraduate student, attempting to understand Cantor's diagonal argument, tries to adapt it to prove that the set of positive rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}^{+}$, is uncountable. The student's argument proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the set of positive rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}^{+}$ is countable.\n2.  If it is countable, we can create an exhaustive list containing every positive rational number: $L = (q_1, q_2, q_3, \\dots, q_n, \\dots)$.\n3.  Each rational number $q_n$ in this list has a decimal expansion. To ensure a unique representation, we agree to never use expansions that end in an infinite sequence of 9s (e.g., we use $0.5$ instead of $0.4999\\dots$). Let the decimal expansion of $q_n$ be $q_n = I_n . a_{n1}a_{n2}a_{n3}\\dots$, where $I_n$ is the integer part and $a_{nk}$ is the $k$-th digit after the decimal point.\n4.  I will now construct a new number, $x$, with the decimal expansion $x = 0.d_1 d_2 d_3 \\dots$. The digits are chosen according to the following rule: for each $n \\geq 1$, the $n$-th digit $d_n$ of $x$ is defined based on the $n$-th digit $a_{nn}$ of the $n$-th rational number $q_n$ in the list. The rule is:\n    - If $a_{nn} = 1$, then $d_n = 2$.\n    - If $a_{nn} \\neq 1$, then $d_n = 1$.\n5.  By its construction, the number $x$ is different from every number $q_n$ in the list $L$. Specifically, $x$ differs from $q_1$ in the first decimal place, from $q_2$ in the second decimal place, and so on. Therefore, $x$ is not in the list $L$.\n6.  But the list $L$ was assumed to contain all positive rational numbers. This is a contradiction.\n7.  Therefore, the initial assumption must be false, and the set of positive rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}^{+}$ is uncountable.\n\nThe student's conclusion is incorrect, as the set of rational numbers is in fact countable. Which of the following statements correctly identifies the fundamental logical flaw in the student's argument?\n\nA. It is impossible to create an ordered list of all positive rational numbers as assumed in step 2.\n\nB. The construction of $x$ is flawed because the choice of digits $d_n$ might result in a number that has an ambiguous decimal representation (e.g., one ending in an infinite sequence of 9s), which was disallowed in step 3.\n\nC. The constructed number $x$ is a real number that is different from every number in the list, but there is no guarantee that $x$ itself is a rational number.\n\nD. The argument is invalid because the list of rational numbers is finite, so the infinite construction in step 4 is not possible.\n\nE. The proof fails because the construction rule for the digits $d_n$ is too simple and will accidentally reproduce one of the numbers already in the list $L$.", "solution": "We assume for contradiction that $\\mathbb{Q}^{+}$ is countable. By definition of countability, there exists a bijection with $\\mathbb{N}$, so we can enumerate all positive rationals as $L=(q_{1},q_{2},q_{3},\\dots)$. Each $q_{n}$ has a decimal expansion, and to ensure uniqueness we forbid representations ending in an infinite tail of $9$s. Thus write $q_{n}=I_{n}.a_{n1}a_{n2}a_{n3}\\dots$, where $I_{n}\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ and each $a_{nk}\\in\\{0,1,\\dots,9\\}$.\n\nDefine a real number $x=0.d_{1}d_{2}d_{3}\\dots$ by the diagonal rule\n$$\nd_{n}=\\begin{cases}\n2,&\\text{if }a_{nn}=1,\\\\\n1,&\\text{if }a_{nn}\\neq 1.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nBy construction, for each $n$ the $n$-th digit of $x$ differs from the $n$-th digit after the decimal point of $q_{n}$, so $x\\neq q_{n}$ for all $n$. Hence $x\\notin L$.\n\nTo derive a contradiction from $x\\notin L$, one would need $x\\in\\mathbb{Q}^{+}$. However, there is no guarantee that $x$ is rational. A classical characterization states: a real number is rational if and only if its base-$10$ decimal expansion is eventually periodic. The sequence $(d_{n})$ is defined by inspecting the diagonal digits $(a_{nn})$ of the arbitrary enumeration; there is no reason that $(d_{n})$ becomes eventually periodic, and generally it will not. Therefore $x$ is typically irrational, so $x\\notin L$ does not contradict that $L$ lists all positive rationals.\n\nThe other proposed flaws do not apply: (i) assuming an ordered list in step 2 is permissible under the contradiction hypothesis; (ii) $x$ cannot have an ambiguous $9$-tail since each $d_{n}\\in\\{1,2\\}$; (iii) the list is infinite, so the diagonal construction is valid; (iv) the diagonal rule guarantees $x$ differs from every $q_{n}$, so it will not accidentally reproduce an entry.\n\nThus the fundamental flaw is that the constructed $x$ need not lie in $\\mathbb{Q}^{+}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2289593"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its use in proofs by contradiction, the diagonal argument provides a constructive recipe for creating a new element not present in any given infinite list.

This shows that every element of $S$ is uniquely specified by an ordered pair of rational numbers $(a, b)$.

Since $a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2$ are all rational numbers, their differences $A$ and $B$ are also rational numbers. The equation becomes $A = B\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nWe consider two cases for the value of $B$.\nCase 1: $B \\neq 0$.\nIf $B$ is not zero, we can write $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{A}{B}$.
