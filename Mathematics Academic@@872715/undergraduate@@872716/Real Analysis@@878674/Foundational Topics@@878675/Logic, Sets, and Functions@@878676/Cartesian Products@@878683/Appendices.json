Let the set $B$ be the set of all positive integers $k$ such that $k \\le 10$.\n\nConsider the Cartesian product $A \\times B$. We define a specific subset of this product, which we will call $S$.

The set $A$ is defined by all positive integers $n$ such that $n^{2} < 30$. Since $1^{2} = 1$, $2^{2} = 4$, $3^{2} = 9$, $4^{2} = 16$, $5^{2} = 25$, and $6^{2} = 36 \\geq 30$, it follows that $A = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$. Thus $|A| = 5$. The set $B$ is the set of all positive integers $k$ with $k \\leq 10$, so $B = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\\}$ and $|B| = 10$.\n\nWe consider the subset $S \\subseteq A \\times B$ consisting of all $(a,b)$ such that $a+b$ is even and $b$ is prime. The relevant number-theoretic principle is that the sum of two integers is even if and only if the two integers have the same parity. We also identify the primes in $B$: the set of primes not exceeding $10$ is $\\{2,3,5,7\\}$.\n\nWe partition by parity. In $A$, the even elements are $A_{\\text{even}} = \\{2,4\\}$ with $|A_{\\text{even}}| = 2$, and the odd elements are $A_{\\text{odd}} = \\{1,3,5\\}$ with $|A_{\\text{odd}}| = 3$. In the prime set, the even prime is $P_{\\text{even}} = \\{2\\}$ with $|P_{\\text{even}}| = 1$, and the odd primes are $P_{\\text{odd}} = \\{3,5,7\\}$ with $|P_{\\text{odd}}| = 3$.\n\nThe condition $a+b$ even requires matching parity between $a$ and $b$. Therefore, the number of valid pairs is the sum of products of the counts within matching parity classes:\n$$\n|S| = |A_{\\text{even}}| \\cdot |P_{\\text{even}}| + |A_{\\text{odd}}| \\cdot |P_{\\text{odd}}| = 2 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 3 = 2 + 9 = 11.\n$$\nThus, the cardinality of $S$ is $11$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11}$$", "id": "1354928"}, {"introduction": "Cartesian products are not just for discrete collections of objects; they are essential for constructing the continuous spaces of geometry and analysis.
