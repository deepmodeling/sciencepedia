This problem expands our analysis to include all critical points, paying special attention to the \"corners\" or \"cusps\" that can arise in functions involving absolute values. By examining a physical model of potential energy, you will learn to identify local minima that correspond to points of stable equilibrium, even at locations where the derivative does not exist [@problem_id:1309094].", "problem": "The one-dimensional potential energy of a particle moving along the x-axis is described by the function $U(x) = k \\left| (x-b)^2 - a^2 \\right|$, where $x$ is the position in meters (m).

Calculate the product of the x-coordinates of all such points.\n\nExpress your answer in square meters ($\\text{m}^2$).", "solution": "The problem asks for the product of the x-coordinates of all points of stable equilibrium. In the context of a potential energy function $U(x)$, points of stable equilibrium correspond to the locations of local minima of $U(x)$.\n\nThe given potential energy function is $U(x) = k \\left| (x-b)^2 - a^2 \\right|$.\nTo find the local minima, we must analyze the critical points of the function $U(x)$. Critical points are the points in the domain where the derivative $U'(x)$ is either zero or undefined.\n\nLet's analyze the expression inside the absolute value, which we can call $g(x) = (x-b)^2 - a^2$. The function is $U(x) = k|g(x)|$. Since the constant $k$ is positive, the extrema of $U(x)$ will occur at the same x-values as the extrema of $|g(x)|$.\n\nThe absolute value function, $|g(x)|$, is always non-negative. Its value is zero when $g(x)=0$. These points, if they exist, will be global minima, and therefore local minima. Let's find these points:\n$g(x) = (x-b)^2 - a^2 = 0$\n$(x-b)^2 = a^2$\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n$x - b = \\pm a$\nThis gives two solutions for $x$:\n$x_1 = b + a$\n$x_2 = b - a$\n\nAt these two points, $U(x_1) = U(x_2) = k|0| = 0$. Since $U(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x$, these two points are global minima of the potential energy. Therefore, $x_1 = b+a$ and $x_2 = b-a$ are points of stable equilibrium.\n\nNext, we must check for any other critical points. The derivative of $U(x)$ may be undefined where the argument of the absolute value is zero, which is at $x_1$ and $x_2$. We have already identified these as local minima. The derivative might also be zero at other points.\n\nTo find the derivative, it is helpful to write $U(x)$ as a piecewise function. The expression $(x-b)^2 - a^2$ is zero at $x=b\\pm a$. It is positive when $|x-b|  a$ and negative when $|x-b|  a$.\nSo,\n$U(x) = \\begin{cases} k((x-b)^2 - a^2)  \\text{if } |x-b| \\ge a \\\\ -k((x-b)^2 - a^2)  \\text{if } |x-b|  a \\end{cases}$\n\nLet's find the derivative, $U'(x)$:\n$U'(x) = \\begin{cases} 2k(x-b)  \\text{if } |x-b|  a \\\\ -2k(x-b)  \\text{if } |x-b|  a \\end{cases}$\n\nThe derivative is undefined at $x=b\\pm a$, as the left-hand and right-hand derivatives are not equal at these points. For instance, at $x=b+a$, the derivative approaches $2k((b+a)-b) = 2ka$ from the right, and $-2k((b+a)-b) = -2ka$ from the left.\n\nNow, let's find where the derivative is zero.\n$U'(x) = 0 \\implies \\pm 2k(x-b) = 0$.\nSince $k$ is a non-zero constant, this implies $x-b = 0$, which gives $x=b$.\nThis point $x=b$ satisfies the condition $|x-b|  a$ (since $0  a$), so it falls within the interval where $U'(x) = -2k(x-b)$.\n\nTo classify this stationary point at $x=b$, we can use the second derivative test on the relevant piece of the function, which is $U(x) = -k((x-b)^2 - a^2)$ for the interval $(b-a, b+a)$.\nThe first derivative is $U'(x) = -2k(x-b)$.\nThe second derivative is $U''(x) = -2k$.\nSince $k = 10.0 \\text{ J/m}^2  0$, the second derivative $U''(b) = -2k$ is negative. This indicates that the potential energy $U(x)$ has a local maximum at $x=b$. A local maximum in potential energy corresponds to an unstable equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, the only points of stable equilibrium (local minima) are $x_1 = b+a$ and $x_2 = b-a$.\n\nThe problem asks for the product of the x-coordinates of these points.\nProduct = $x_1 \\cdot x_2 = (b+a)(b-a)$.\nUsing the difference of squares formula, this simplifies to:\nProduct = $b^2 - a^2$.\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values: $a = 2.0 \\text{ m}$ and $b = 0.5 \\text{ m}$.\nProduct = $(0.5)^2 - (2.0)^2$\nProduct = $0.25 - 4.0$\nProduct = $-3.75$\n\nThe units of the product of two coordinates in meters will be square meters ($\\text{m}^2$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-3.75}$$", "id": "1309094"}]}
