This function is defined with respect to a specific set of points on the real line. Let $S$ be the set of reciprocals of all positive integers, i.e., $S = \\{1/n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+\\}$.

Neither $L_-$ nor $L_+$ exists.\n\nE. $L_- = 0$ and $L_+ = 0$.", "solution": "We will analyze the left-hand limit $L_-$ and the right-hand limit $L_+$ separately.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the left-hand limit, $L_- = \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f(x)$.\nThe definition of the left-hand limit states that $\\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f(x) = L$ if for every $\\epsilon  0$, there exists a $\\delta  0$ such that for all $x$ satisfying $-\\delta  x  0$, we have $|f(x) - L|  \\epsilon$.\nThe set $S$ is defined as $S = \\{1/n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+\\} = \\{1, 1/2, 1/3, \\dots\\}$. All elements of $S$ are strictly positive.\nFor any $x$ in an interval $(-\\delta, 0)$, we have $x  0$. Since all elements of $S$ are positive, any negative number $x$ cannot be in $S$.\nTherefore, for any $x  0$, we have $x \\notin S$.\nBy the definition of the function $f(x)$, if $x \\notin S$, then $f(x) = 0$.\nSo, for any $x$ in any interval $(-\\delta, 0)$, $f(x)$ is identically equal to 0.\nLet's test if the limit is 0. Let $L = 0$. For any given $\\epsilon  0$, we can choose any $\\delta  0$. For any $x$ such that $-\\delta  x  0$, we have $f(x)=0$. Then, $|f(x) - 0| = |0-0| = 0$. Since $0  \\epsilon$ for any $\\epsilon  0$, the condition for the limit is satisfied.\nThus, the left-hand limit exists and is equal to 0. We have $L_- = 0$.\n\nNext, let's analyze the right-hand limit, $L_+ = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(x)$.\nFor the limit to exist and be equal to a value $L$, for every $\\epsilon  0$, there must exist a $\\delta  0$ such that for all $x$ satisfying $0  x  \\delta$, we have $|f(x) - L|  \\epsilon$.\nLet's analyze the behavior of $f(x)$ in an arbitrary interval $(0, \\delta)$, where $\\delta  0$.\nBy the Archimedean property of the real numbers, for any $\\delta  0$, we can find a positive integer $N$ such that $N  1/\\delta$. This implies that $0  1/N  \\delta$.\nLet $x_1 = 1/N$. Since $N$ is a positive integer, $x_1 \\in S$. The value of the function at this point is $f(x_1) = 1$. This point $x_1$ is in the interval $(0, \\delta)$.\nNow, consider the point $x_2 = \\frac{1}{2N} \\sqrt{2}$. Since $1  \\sqrt{2}  2$, we have $1/(2N)  x_2  1/N$. Since $1/N  \\delta$, it follows that $0  x_2  \\delta$. The point $x_2$ is irrational because it is a rational multiple of $\\sqrt{2}$, so $x_2$ cannot be in the set $S$ (which contains only rational numbers). Therefore, the value of the function at this point is $f(x_2) = 0$. This point $x_2$ is also in the interval $(0, \\delta)$.\nThis means that for any $\\delta  0$, no matter how small, the interval $(0, \\delta)$ contains points where $f(x) = 1$ and points where $f(x) = 0$.\nNow we will show by contradiction that the limit cannot exist. Assume that $\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(x) = L$ for some number $L$.\nLet's choose $\\epsilon = 1/3$. According to the definition of the limit, there must exist some $\\delta  0$ such that for all $x \\in (0, \\delta)$, we have $|f(x) - L|  1/3$.\nAs we've shown, we can find a point $x_1 \\in (0, \\delta)$ such that $f(x_1) = 1$, and a point $x_2 \\in (0, \\delta)$ such that $f(x_2) = 0$.\nFor $x_1$, the condition implies $|1 - L|  1/3$. This is equivalent to $1 - 1/3  L  1 + 1/3$, or $2/3  L  4/3$.\nFor $x_2$, the condition implies $|0 - L|  1/3$. This is equivalent to $-1/3  L  1/3$.\nThe two conditions on $L$ are $L \\in (2/3, 4/3)$ and $L \\in (-1/3, 1/3)$. These two intervals are disjoint. There is no real number $L$ that can satisfy both conditions simultaneously.\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that the right-hand limit exists must be false.\nSo, $L_+$ does not exist.\n\nIn summary, we have found that $L_- = 0$ and $L_+$ does not exist.
