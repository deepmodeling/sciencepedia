This problem presents a function that is continuous on a closed and bounded (compact) interval, which guarantees its uniform continuity. However, it introduces a subtle twist: the function's derivative is unbounded within the interval, a property that might incorrectly lead one to conclude the function is not uniformly continuous. This exercise challenges you to apply the Heine-Cantor theorem correctly and recognize that a bounded derivative is a sufficient, but not necessary, condition for uniform continuity [@problem_id:2331992].", "problem": "Consider the function $f: [0, 2] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by the rule $f(x) = (x-1)^{1/3}$. Which of the following statements accurately describes the uniform continuity of this function on the closed interval $I = [0, 2]$?\n\nA. The function $f$ is uniformly continuous on $I$ because it is a continuous function on a closed and bounded interval.\nB. The function $f$ is not uniformly continuous on $I$ because its derivative is unbounded at a point within the interval.\nC.

The function $f$ is uniformly continuous on $I$ because its derivative is bounded on the interval.\nE. The function $f$ is not uniformly continuous on $I$ because it does not satisfy the Mean Value Theorem on any subinterval containing $x=1$.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine if the function $f(x) = (x-1)^{1/3}$ is uniformly continuous on the closed interval $I = [0, 2]$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the function and its domain. The function involves a cube root, which is defined and continuous for all real numbers. The function $g(x) = x-1$ is a polynomial and is continuous everywhere. The function $h(y) = y^{1/3}$ is also continuous everywhere. Since $f(x)$ is a composition of continuous functions, $f(x) = h(g(x))$, it is continuous on its entire domain, $\\mathbb{R}$, and therefore is continuous on the interval $I = [0, 2]$.\n\nThe domain $I = [0, 2]$ is a closed and bounded interval in $\\mathbb{R}$. A fundamental result in real analysis, the Heine-Cantor theorem, states that any continuous function on a compact set is uniformly continuous on that set. In the context of $\\mathbb{R}$, a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. Since $I = [0, 2]$ is a closed and bounded set (and thus compact) and $f(x)$ is continuous on $I$, we can directly conclude that $f(x)$ is uniformly continuous on $I = [0, 2]$. This matches the reasoning in option A.\n\nNow, let's analyze the other options to understand why they are incorrect.\n\nFor option B, we consider the derivative of $f(x)$. For $x \\neq 1$, the derivative is:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (x-1)^{1/3} = \\frac{1}{3}(x-1)^{-2/3} = \\frac{1}{3(x-1)^{2/3}} $$\nAs $x$ approaches $1$, the denominator $(x-1)^{2/3}$ approaches $0$ from the positive side, which means that the derivative $f'(x)$ approaches $+\\infty$. Therefore, the derivative of $f$ is indeed unbounded on the interval $[0, 2]$. However, the statement that an unbounded derivative implies a lack of uniform continuity is false. While a bounded derivative on an interval is a sufficient condition for uniform continuity, it is not a necessary one. This problem serves as a classic counterexample. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\nFor option C, we note that since the derivative $f'(x)$ is unbounded as $x \\to 1$, the function is not differentiable at $x=1$. The limit of the difference quotient does not exist as a finite number. While it is true that $f$ is not differentiable at $x=1$, this fact alone does not preclude uniform continuity. A simple example is $g(x) = |x|$ on $[-1, 1]$, which is uniformly continuous but not differentiable at $x=0$. Thus, a function does not need to be differentiable everywhere on an interval to be uniformly continuous. So, option C is incorrect.\n\nFor option D, the statement claims that the derivative is bounded. As we calculated above, the derivative is unbounded near $x=1$. Therefore, the premise of this statement is factually incorrect. So, option D is incorrect.\n\nFor option E, the Mean Value Theorem requires the function to be continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$ and differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$. Since $f(x)$ is not differentiable at $x=1$, the Mean Value Theorem does not apply to any interval $(a, b)$ that contains $1$. However, this failure to satisfy the hypotheses of the Mean Value Theorem does not have a direct implication on whether the function is uniformly continuous. Uniform continuity is a more fundamental property related to continuity on a compact set. Therefore, option E provides an irrelevant reason and is incorrect.\n\nBased on the Heine-Cantor theorem, the correct reasoning is that $f(x)$ is a continuous function on a compact set, which implies it is uniformly continuous.

While the sum of two uniformly continuous functions is always uniformly continuous, the same cannot be said for their product. This practice guides you to explore a critical counterexample involving the product of two functions, $f(x)=x$ and $g(x)=\\cos(x)$, which are both uniformly continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$.

First, $h_{2}$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$ because $\\lim_{x\\to 0}x\\sin(1/x)=0$. Also $|h_{2}(x)|\\leq 1$ for $x\\neq 0$. To show uniform continuity on $\\mathbb{R}$, proceed as follows. On the compact interval $[-3,3]$, $h_{2}$ is continuous, hence uniformly continuous by the Heine–Cantor theorem: for any $\\epsilon0$ there exists $\\delta_{c}0$ such that if $x,y\\in[-3,3]$ and $|x-y|\\delta_{c}$, then $|h_{2}(x)-h_{2}(y)|\\epsilon$.

Since $\\sin$ is continuous with $\\sin x_{n}=1$, there exists $s_{0}0$ such that if $|s|\\leq s_{0}$, then $\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+s\\right)\\geq \\frac{1}{2}$.
