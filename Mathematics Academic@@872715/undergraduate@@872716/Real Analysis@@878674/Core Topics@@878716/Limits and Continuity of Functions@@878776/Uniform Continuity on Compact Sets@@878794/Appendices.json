On $[-1,0]$, $x\\mapsto\\sin(\\pi x)$ is continuous because the sine function and the map $x\\mapsto\\pi x$ are continuous. On $(0,1]$, $x\\mapsto x^{3}-x$ is a polynomial and hence continuous.

Since both one-sided limits equal $0=f(0)$, $f$ is continuous at $x=0$. Therefore, $f$ is continuous on $[-1,1]$.\n\nTo determine uniform continuity, we use the Heine–Cantor theorem: a continuous function on a compact set is uniformly continuous. The interval $[-1,1]$ is compact in $\\mathbb{R}$, and we have shown $f$ is continuous on $[-1,1]$.
