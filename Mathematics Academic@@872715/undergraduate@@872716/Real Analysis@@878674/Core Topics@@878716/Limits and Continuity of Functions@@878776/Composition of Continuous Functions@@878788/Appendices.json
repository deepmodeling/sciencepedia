If $g(x_{0})=m\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, continuity of $h$ at $x_{0}$ depends on whether $g$ crosses the integer level at $x_0$.\n\nApply this to $g(x)=2\\sin(x)$, whose range is $[-2,2]$.

For all $x$ in a sufficiently small neighborhood of $x_{0}$, we have $-2 \\le g(x)  -1$. Thus, for all $x$ in this neighborhood, $\\lfloor g(x) \\rfloor = -2$.

Hence $g(x)=f(D(x))$ takes only the two values $f(1)$ (on rationals) and $f(0)$ (on irrationals).

Therefore, $f(0)=f(1)$ is necessary for continuity of $g$ at any $x$, and thus for continuity on all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSufficiency: Suppose $f(0)=f(1)=c$ for some $c\\in\\mathbb{R}$.
