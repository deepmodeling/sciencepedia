We are looking for the smallest positive integer $N$ such that for all $m, n  N$, $|s_m - s_n|  \\epsilon$.\n\nThe expression for $s_n$ is $s_n = \\frac{3}{n} + \\frac{1}{n+2}$. Let's write out the term $|s_m - s_n|$:\n$$|s_m - s_n| = \\left| \\left(\\frac{3}{m} + \\frac{1}{m+2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{3}{n} + \\frac{1}{n+2}\\right) \\right|$$\n$$|s_m - s_n| = \\left| \\left(\\frac{3}{m} - \\frac{3}{n}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{m+2} - \\frac{1}{n+2}\\right) \\right|$$\n\nWithout loss of generality, let us assume $m  n$. Since $m,n$ must be greater than $N$, the smallest value $n$ can take is $N+1$.\nIf $m  n$, then $\\frac{1}{m}  \\frac{1}{n}$ and $\\frac{1}{m+2}  \\frac{1}{n+2}$. Therefore, the terms inside the absolute value are negative:\n$$s_m - s_n = \\left(\\frac{3}{m} - \\frac{3}{n}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{m+2} - \\frac{1}{n+2}\\right)  0$$\nSo we can write the absolute value as:\n$$|s_m - s_n| = \\left(\\frac{3}{n} - \\frac{3}{m}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{n+2} - \\frac{1}{m+2}\\right)$$\nTo find an upper bound for this expression that holds for all $m,n  N$, we can analyze its behavior. For a fixed $n$, the expression increases as $m$ increases, because the negative terms $-\\frac{3}{m}$ and $-\\frac{1}{m+2}$ approach 0. We can find the least upper bound (supremum) by taking the limit as $m \\to \\infty$:\n$$\\sup_{m  n} |s_m - s_n| = \\lim_{m \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{3}{n} - \\frac{3}{m}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{n+2} - \\frac{1}{m+2}\\right) \\right]$$\n$$\\sup_{m  n} |s_m - s_n| = \\left(\\frac{3}{n} - 0\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{n+2} - 0\\right) = \\frac{3}{n} + \\frac{1}{n+2} = s_n$$\nSo, the condition that $|s_m - s_n|  \\epsilon$ for all $m,n  N$ is satisfied if we ensure that for any $n  N$, the supremum of the differences is less than $\\epsilon$. This means we need $s_n  \\epsilon$ for all $n  N$.\n\nThe function $s_n = \\frac{3}{n} + \\frac{1}{n+2}$ is a sum of two strictly decreasing functions for positive $n$, so $s_n$ is also strictly decreasing.\nTherefore, the condition that $s_n  \\epsilon$ for all $n  N$ is equivalent to ensuring that the condition holds for the first possible value of $n$, which is $n = N+1$.\nSo we need to find the smallest integer $N$ such that $s_{N+1}  \\epsilon$.\n$$s_{N+1} = \\frac{3}{N+1} + \\frac{1}{(N+1)+2} = \\frac{3}{N+1} + \\frac{1}{N+3}$$\nWe set up the inequality:\n$$\\frac{3}{N+1} + \\frac{1}{N+3}  0.04$$\nTo find the smallest integer $N$, we can test values of $N$.

Let's test integers around this value.\n\nLet's check $N=75$:\nWe need to check if $s_{76}  0.04$.\n$s_{76} = \\frac{3}{76} + \\frac{1}{78} \\approx 0.039473 + 0.012820 = 0.052293$. This is not less than $0.04$. So $N=75$ is not sufficient.\n\nThe approximation $\\frac{3}{N} \\approx 0.04$ was too simple. A better approximation is $\\frac{3}{N} + \\frac{1}{N} = \\frac{4}{N} \\approx 0.04$, which gives $N \\approx \\frac{4}{0.04} = 100$. Let's test $N$ around 100.\n\nLet's check $N=99$:\nWe need to check if $s_{100}  0.04$.\n$s_{100} = \\frac{3}{100} + \\frac{1}{102} = 0.03 + \\frac{1}{102}$.\n$\\frac{1}{102} \\approx 0.0098$. So $s_{100} \\approx 0.0398$. Let's calculate exactly.\n$s_{100} = \\frac{3}{100} + \\frac{1}{102} = \\frac{3 \\times 102 + 1 \\times 100}{100 \\times 102} = \\frac{306 + 100}{10200} = \\frac{406}{10200} \\approx 0.03980...$\nSince $0.03980...  0.04$, the condition holds for $n=100$. Because $s_n$ is a decreasing sequence, the condition will also hold for all $n  100$. Thus, $N=99$ is a possible value. Let's see if it's the smallest.\n\nLet's check $N=98$:\nWe need to check if $s_{99}  0.04$.\n$s_{99} = \\frac{3}{99} + \\frac{1}{101} = \\frac{1}{33} + \\frac{1}{101}$.\n$s_{99} = \\frac{101 + 33}{33 \\times 101} = \\frac{134}{3333} \\approx 0.040204...$\nSince $0.040204... \\not 0.04$, the condition fails for $n=99$.
