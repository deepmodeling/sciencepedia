The numerator is a difference of squares, or we can expand it directly:\n$(n+1)^2 - n^2 = (n^2 + 2n + 1) - n^2 = 2n + 1$.\nSo, the general term is:\n$$a_n = \\frac{2n + 1}{\\sqrt{n^5 + n}}$$\nSince all terms $a_n$ are positive for $n \\ge 1$, we can use tests for series with positive terms, such as the Limit Comparison Test.\n\nTo use the Limit Comparison Test, we need to choose a suitable series $\\sum b_n$ for comparison. We can find an appropriate $b_n$ by examining the dominant behavior of $a_n$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\nFor large $n$, the numerator $2n+1$ behaves like $2n$.\nThe term inside the square root in the denominator, $n^5+n$, behaves like $n^5$.\nTherefore, the denominator $\\sqrt{n^5+n}$ behaves like $\\sqrt{n^5} = n^{5/2}$.\nCombining these, $a_n$ behaves like $\\frac{2n}{n^{5/2}} = \\frac{2}{n^{3/2}}$.\n\nThis suggests we should compare our series with the p-series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_n$ where $b_n = \\frac{1}{n^{3/2}}$.\nThe series $\\sum b_n = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{3/2}}$ is a p-series with $p = 3/2$. Since $p = 3/2  1$, the series $\\sum b_n$ converges.\n\nNow, we apply the Limit Comparison Test by evaluating the limit $L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{a_n}{b_n}$.\n$$L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{2n + 1}{\\sqrt{n^5 + n}}}{\\frac{1}{n^{3/2}}} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{(2n + 1)n^{3/2}}{\\sqrt{n^5 + n}}$$\nTo evaluate this limit, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of $n$ in the expression, which is $n^{5/2}$.\nIn the numerator, we have $(2n+1)n^{3/2} = 2n^{5/2} + n^{3/2}$.\nIn the denominator, we can factor out $n^5$ from the square root: $\\sqrt{n^5 + n} = \\sqrt{n^5(1 + \\frac{n}{n^5})} = \\sqrt{n^5}\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{n^4}} = n^{5/2}\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{n^4}}$.\n\nSo the limit becomes:\n$$L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2n^{5/2} + n^{3/2}}{n^{5/2}\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{n^4}}}$$\nDivide both the numerator and the denominator by $n^{5/2}$:\n$$L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{2n^{5/2}}{n^{5/2}} + \\frac{n^{3/2}}{n^{5/2}}}{\\frac{n^{5/2}\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{n^4}}}{n^{5/2}}} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2 + \\frac{1}{n}}{\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{n^4}}}$$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, we have $\\frac{1}{n} \\to 0$ and $\\frac{1}{n^4} \\to 0$.\n$$L = \\frac{2 + 0}{\\sqrt{1 + 0}} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$$\nThe Limit Comparison Test states that if $L$ is a finite positive number (i.e., $0  L  \\infty$), then both series $\\sum a_n$ and $\\sum b_n$ share the same convergence behavior.\nSince we found $L=2$, which is finite and positive, and we know that the comparison series $\\sum b_n = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{3/2}}$ converges, we can conclude that the original series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(n+1)^2 - n^2}{\\sqrt{n^5 + n}}$ also converges.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. The series converges. This matches our conclusion.\nB. The series diverges. This contradicts our conclusion.\nC. The series is conditionally convergent. This is incorrect. A series is conditionally convergent if it converges but its series of absolute values diverges. Since all our terms $a_n$ are positive, absolute convergence is the same as convergence.\nD. The convergence of the series cannot be determined by standard comparison tests. This is false, as we successfully used the Limit Comparison Test.\nE.

The form of the term $a_n$ is suggestive of the p-series, but the exponent is not constant. As $n \\to \\infty$, the exponent $1 + 1/n$ approaches $1$. This suggests that the series might behave similarly to the harmonic series, $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_n$, where $b_n = \\frac{1}{n}$.

Both $a_n$ and $b_n$ are positive for all $n \\ge 1$. The Limit Comparison Test states that if the limit $L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{a_n}{b_n}$ exists and is a finite positive number ($0  L  \\infty$), then both series $\\sum a_n$ and $\\sum b_n$ either converge or diverge together.\n\nLet's compute the limit $L$:\n$$ L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{a_n}{b_n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{1}{n^{1 + 1/n}}}{\\frac{1}{n}} $$\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n$$ L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n}{n^{1 + 1/n}} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n}{n^1 \\cdot n^{1/n}} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{1/n}} $$\nNow, we need to evaluate the limit of the term $n^{1/n}$ as $n \\to \\infty$. This is an indeterminate form of the type $\\infty^0$. Let's analyze this limit separately. Let $y = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n^{1/n}$. We can evaluate this by taking the natural logarithm:\n$$ \\ln(y) = \\ln\\left(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n^{1/n}\\right) $$\nSince the natural logarithm is a continuous function, we can move the limit inside:\n$$ \\ln(y) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ln(n^{1/n}) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\ln(n) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\ln(n)}{n} $$\nThis limit is of the indeterminate form $\\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}$. We can apply L'Hôpital's Rule by differentiating the numerator and the denominator with respect to $n$:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\ln(n)}{n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{d}{dn}(\\ln(n))}{\\frac{d}{dn}(n)} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1/n}{1} = 0 $$\nSo, we have $\\ln(y) = 0$. To find $y$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$ y = e^0 = 1 $$\nTherefore, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n^{1/n} = 1$.\n\nNow, we can substitute this result back into our original limit $L$:\n$$ L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{1/n}} = \\frac{1}{\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n^{1/n}} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1 $$\nSince the limit $L=1$ is a finite positive number ($0  1  \\infty$), the Limit Comparison Test applies. This means that the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{1 + 1/n}}$ has the same convergence behavior as the harmonic series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n}$.\n\nThe harmonic series is a p-series with $p=1$, and it is known to diverge. Consequently, the given series also diverges.\n\nSince all terms of the series are positive, the distinction between absolute and conditional convergence is not relevant; if the series were to converge, it would converge absolutely.
