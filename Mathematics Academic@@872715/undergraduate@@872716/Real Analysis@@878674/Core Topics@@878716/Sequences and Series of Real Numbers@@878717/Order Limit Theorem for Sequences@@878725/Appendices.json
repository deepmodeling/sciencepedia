Express this value $c$ as an exact analytical expression.", "solution": "Let the function that defines the recurrence be $f(x) = \\frac{x^3 + 15x}{3x^2 + 5}$. The sequence is then given by $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$.\n\nThe problem asks for a lower bound on the limit $L$. A common technique for such problems is to find an invariant interval for the sequence. That is, we seek a value $c$ such that if a term $x_n$ is greater than or equal to $c$, then the next term $x_{n+1}$ is also greater than or equal to $c$. If we can show that the first term $x_1$ satisfies this condition, then all terms of the sequence will be bounded below by $c$. The Order Limit Theorem would then imply that the limit $L$ is also bounded below by $c$.\n\nLet's hypothesize a value for $c$. A natural choice for such a bound is often a fixed point of the function $f(x)$, where $f(c)=c$. Let's try to find a value $c$ such that the interval $[c, \\infty)$ is invariant. This requires $f(x) \\ge c$ for all $x \\ge c$.\n\nLet's test $c = \\sqrt{5}$. We want to determine the sign of $f(x) - \\sqrt{5}$ for $x \\ge \\sqrt{5}$.\nWe start by computing the difference:\n$$ f(x) - \\sqrt{5} = \\frac{x^3 + 15x}{3x^2 + 5} - \\sqrt{5} $$\nTo combine these terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$ f(x) - \\sqrt{5} = \\frac{x^3 + 15x - \\sqrt{5}(3x^2 + 5)}{3x^2 + 5} $$\nDistributing the $-\\sqrt{5}$ term in the numerator gives:\n$$ f(x) - \\sqrt{5} = \\frac{x^3 + 15x - 3\\sqrt{5}x^2 - 5\\sqrt{5}}{3x^2 + 5} $$\nReordering the terms in the numerator by powers of $x$:\n$$ f(x) - \\sqrt{5} = \\frac{x^3 - 3\\sqrt{5}x^2 + 15x - 5\\sqrt{5}}{3x^2 + 5} $$\nThe numerator has a structure that resembles the binomial expansion of $(a-b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3$. Let's check if the numerator matches $(x - \\sqrt{5})^3$:\n$$ (x - \\sqrt{5})^3 = x^3 - 3x^2(\\sqrt{5}) + 3x(\\sqrt{5})^2 - (\\sqrt{5})^3 = x^3 - 3\\sqrt{5}x^2 + 15x - 5\\sqrt{5} $$\nThe numerator is indeed a perfect cube. So we can write:\n$$ f(x) - \\sqrt{5} = \\frac{(x - \\sqrt{5})^3}{3x^2 + 5} $$\nFor any real $x$, the denominator $3x^2 + 5$ is strictly positive. Therefore, the sign of $f(x) - \\sqrt{5}$ is the same as the sign of $(x - \\sqrt{5})^3$.\nIf $x \\ge \\sqrt{5}$, then $x-\\sqrt{5} \\ge 0$, which implies $(x - \\sqrt{5})^3 \\ge 0$.\nConsequently, if $x \\ge \\sqrt{5}$, then $f(x) - \\sqrt{5} \\ge 0$, which means $f(x) \\ge \\sqrt{5}$.\n\nWe have shown that the interval $[\\sqrt{5}, \\infty)$ is an invariant set for the function $f(x)$. Now we can use mathematical induction to show that all terms of the sequence $(x_n)$ are in this interval.\n\n**Base Case:** For $n=1$, we are given $x_1 = 3$. Since $3^2 = 9$ and $(\\sqrt{5})^2 = 5$, we have $9 > 5$, which implies $3 > \\sqrt{5}$. The base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:** Assume that for some integer $k \\ge 1$, we have $x_k \\ge \\sqrt{5}$. We need to show that $x_{k+1} \\ge \\sqrt{5}$.\nFrom the definition of the sequence, $x_{k+1} = f(x_k)$. Since we have shown that $x \\ge \\sqrt{5}$ implies $f(x) \\ge \\sqrt{5}$, and our inductive hypothesis is $x_k \\ge \\sqrt{5}$, it follows directly that $x_{k+1} = f(x_k) \\ge \\sqrt{5}$.\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that $x_n \\ge \\sqrt{5}$ for all integers $n \\ge 1$.\n\nThe problem states that the sequence $(x_n)_{n \\geq 1}$ converges to a limit $L$. Since we have established that $x_n \\ge \\sqrt{5}$ for all $n \\ge 1$, the Order Limit Theorem for sequences implies that the limit must also satisfy this inequality.
