Specifically, we will check if it is closed and bounded. By the Heine-Borel theorem in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, a set is compact if and only if it is both closed and bounded.\n\nFirst, let's check if the set $A$ is bounded. A set is bounded if it is contained within some ball of finite radius. For any point $(x,y) \\in A$, its coordinates are given by $x = \\cos^3(t)$ and $y = \\sin^3(t)$ for some $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.

This implies that $\\cos^2(t) \\le 1$ and $\\sin^2(t) \\le 1$.\nConsequently, for powers greater than 2, we have $\\cos^6(t) \\le \\cos^2(t)$ and $\\sin^6(t) \\le \\sin^2(t)$, since the base is less than or equal to 1.\nSumming these inequalities, we get:\n$$\n\\cos^6(t) + \\sin^6(t) \\le \\cos^2(t) + \\sin^2(t)\n$$\nUsing the fundamental trigonometric identity $\\cos^2(t) + \\sin^2(t) = 1$, we have:\n$$\n\\cos^6(t) + \\sin^6(t) \\le 1\n$$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\cos^6(t) + \\sin^6(t)} \\le \\sqrt{1} = 1\n$$\nSo, for any point $(x,y) \\in A$, its distance from the origin is less than or equal to 1. This means the entire set $A$ is contained within the closed disk of radius 1 centered at the origin. Therefore, the set $A$ is bounded. This eliminates options A, B, and E.\n\nNext, let's check if the set $A$ is closed. We can use a powerful result from real analysis: the continuous image of a compact set is compact.\nConsider the function $f: [0, 2\\pi] \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ defined by $f(t) = (\\cos^3(t), \\sin^3(t))$.\nThe domain of this function is the interval $D = [0, 2\\pi]$. In $\\mathbb{R}$, this is a closed and bounded interval. By the Heine-Borel theorem in $\\mathbb{R}$, the set $D$ is compact.\nThe component functions of $f$ are $f_1(t) = \\cos^3(t)$ and $f_2(t) = \\sin^3(t)$. The functions $\\cos(t)$, $\\sin(t)$, and the cubing function $u \\mapsto u^3$ are all continuous. The composition of continuous functions is continuous, so $f_1(t)$ and $f_2(t)$ are continuous. A function into $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is continuous if and only if its component functions are continuous. Therefore, $f$ is a continuous function.\nThe set $A$ is precisely the image of the compact set $D=[0, 2\\pi]$ under the continuous function $f$. That is, $A = f(D)$.\nSince the continuous image of a compact set is compact, we can conclude that the set $A$ is a compact set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nSince $A$ is compact, it is by definition closed and bounded.\nLet's review the options:\nA.
