A set $A$ is closed if it contains all of its limit points.

We show that $0$ is a limit point of $S_1$. Let $\\epsilon > 0$ be arbitrary. Choose $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $n > 1/\\epsilon$. Then $0  1/n  \\epsilon$, and $1/n \\in S_1$ with $1/n \\neq 0$. Hence every open interval around $0$ contains a point of $S_1$ different from $0$, so $0$ is a limit point of $S_1$. Next, we show that $S_1$ has no other limit points. Let $x \\neq 0$. If $x \\notin S_1$, define $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $1/N  |x|/2$. For all $n \\geq N$, we have $|x - 1/n| \\geq |x| - 1/n > |x|/2$. For the finitely many $n  N$, set $d = \\min_{1 \\leq n  N} |x - 1/n| > 0$. Take $\\delta = \\min\\{|x|/2, d/2\\} > 0$.

If $x = 1/k \\in S_1$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we show $x$ is isolated, hence not a limit point.

For $k=1$, take $\\delta = 1/4$ since $1 - 1/2 = 1/2$. Thus every point of $S_1$ is isolated. Therefore the only limit point of $S_1$ is $0$. Since $0 \\notin S_1$, $S_1$ does not contain all its limit points, so $S_1$ is not closed. Hence assertion I is false and assertion III is true.\n\nNow consider $S_2 = S_1 \\cup \\{0\\}$. We first show $0$ is a limit point of $S_2$: the same $\\epsilon$-argument as above using points $1/n \\in S_1 \\subset S_2$ shows every neighborhood of $0$ contains a point of $S_2$ different from $0$. Next, we show that no $x \\neq 0$ is a limit point of $S_2$. If $x = 1/k \\in S_1$, the same isolation argument as above provides $\\delta > 0$ with $(x - \\delta, x + \\delta) \\cap S_2 = \\{x\\}$, so $x$ is not a limit point. If $x \\notin S_2$ and $x \\neq 0$, choose $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $1/N  |x|/2$. As before, for $n \\geq N$, $|x - 1/n| > |x|/2$. Define $d = \\min\\{|x|, \\min_{1 \\leq n  N} |x - 1/n|\\} > 0$ and take $\\delta = d/2 > 0$. Then $(x - \\delta, x + \\delta) \\cap S_2 = \\varnothing$. Hence the only limit point of $S_2$ is $0$. Since $0 \\in S_2$, the set $S_2$ contains all its limit points and is closed. Therefore assertion II is true.\n\nFinally, since the set of all limit points of $S_1$ is $\\{0\\}$ and the set of all limit points of $S_2$ is also $\\{0\\}$, these two sets of limit points are identical.
