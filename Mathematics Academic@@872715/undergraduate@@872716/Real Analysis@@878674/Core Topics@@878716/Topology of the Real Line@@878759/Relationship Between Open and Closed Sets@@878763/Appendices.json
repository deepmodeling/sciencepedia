While open intervals like $(a, b)$ and closed intervals like $[a, b]$ have clear topological properties, the half-open interval presents a classic case study.

A point $x \\in S$ is an interior point if there exists an open interval $(x-\\epsilon, x+\\epsilon)$ for some $\\epsilon  0$ that is entirely contained within $S$.\nLet's consider an element of $S$. For $n=1$, we have $s_1 = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\frac{1}{1} = 0 + 1 = 1$. So, $1 \\in S$.\nNow, consider any open interval centered at 1, for instance, $(1-\\epsilon, 1+\\epsilon)$ for any $\\epsilon  0$. This interval contains uncountably many real numbers, including irrational numbers. However, every element of $S$ is of the form $\\cos(\\frac{n\\pi}{2}) + \\frac{1}{n}$. The term $\\cos(\\frac{n\\pi}{2})$ can only take values from $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, all of which are rational. The term $\\frac{1}{n}$ is also always rational for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The sum of two rational numbers is rational. Thus, all elements of $S$ are rational numbers.\nSince any open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ contains irrational numbers, no open interval around $1$ can be a subset of $S$. Therefore, $1$ is not an interior point of $S$. Since $S$ contains at least one point that is not an interior point, $S$ is not an open set. This eliminates options A and C.\n\nNext, we test if the set $S$ is closed.\nA set is closed if and only if it contains all of its limit points. A point $L$ is a limit point (or accumulation point) of $S$ if every open neighborhood of $L$ contains at least one point of $S$ different from $L$. To find the limit points of $S$, we analyze the behavior of the sequence $s_n$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\nThe term $\\frac{1}{n}$ converges to $0$ as $n \\to \\infty$. The behavior of $s_n$ is dominated by the oscillatory term $\\cos(\\frac{n\\pi}{2})$, which cycles through the values $0, -1, 0, 1, \\ldots$. We can analyze the convergence of $s_n$ by considering subsequences based on the values of $n$ modulo 4.\n\nCase 1: $n = 4k-3$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ (i.e., $n = 1, 5, 9, \\ldots$).\nThe terms are $s_{4k-3} = \\cos\\left(\\frac{(4k-3)\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{4k-3} = \\cos\\left(2k\\pi - \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{4k-3} = 0 + \\frac{1}{4k-3}$.\nAs $k \\to \\infty$, $s_{4k-3} \\to 0$.

Thus, $-1$ is a limit point of $S$.\n\nCase 3: $n = 4k-1$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ (i.e., $n = 3, 7, 11, \\ldots$).\nThe terms are $s_{4k-1} = \\cos\\left(\\frac{(4k-1)\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{4k-1} = \\cos\\left(2k\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{4k-1} = 0 + \\frac{1}{4k-1}$.\nAs $k \\to \\infty$, $s_{4k-1} \\to 0$.

This would require $\\frac{1}{n}=-1$ or $\\frac{1}{n}=1$, respectively. This gives $n=-1$ (not in $\\mathbb{N}$) or $n=1$ (not even). Therefore, there is no $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ for which $s_n=0$. So, $0 \\notin S$.\n- Is $-1 \\in S$? We need to find an $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\cos(\\frac{n\\pi}{2}) + \\frac{1}{n} = -1$.\n  If $n$ is odd, $\\cos(\\frac{n\\pi}{2})=0$, so we need $\\frac{1}{n}=-1$, which implies $n=-1$, not in $\\mathbb{N}$.\n  If $n$ is even, $\\cos(\\frac{n\\pi}{2})$ is either $1$ or $-1$. This would require $\\frac{1}{n}=-2$ or $\\frac{1}{n}=0$, respectively. This gives $n=-1/2$ (not in $\\mathbb{N}$) or is impossible. Therefore, there is no $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ for which $s_n=-1$. So, $-1 \\notin S$.\n\nSince the set of limit points is $S' = \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ and $S$ does not contain $-1$ or $0$, $S$ does not contain all its limit points. Therefore, $S$ is not a closed set. This eliminates option B.\n\nSince $S$ is neither open nor closed, option D is the correct description. Options E and F are clearly false; we already showed $1 \\in S$, so $S$ is not empty.
