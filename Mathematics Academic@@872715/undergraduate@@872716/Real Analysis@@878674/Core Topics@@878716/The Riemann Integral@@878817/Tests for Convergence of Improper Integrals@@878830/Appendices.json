To solve this, you must learn the critical technique of splitting the integral into two separate parts, each with a single improper point.

Determine the values of the endpoints $a$ and $b$.", "solution": "To determine the values of $p$ for which the integral $I(p) = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\arctan(x)}{x^p} dx$ converges, we must examine the behavior of the integrand at the two points where the integral is improper: near $x=0$ and as $x \\to \\infty$.\n\nAn improper integral of this form converges if and only if we can split it into two parts that both converge. A convenient splitting point is $x=1$:\n$$ I(p) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\arctan(x)}{x^p} dx + \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{\\arctan(x)}{x^p} dx $$\nLet's call these two integrals $I_1$ and $I_2$ respectively. We will analyze the convergence of each part separately using the Limit Comparison Test.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the convergence of $I_2 = \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{\\arctan(x)}{x^p} dx$. The integrand is $f(x) = \\frac{\\arctan(x)}{x^p}$. As $x \\to \\infty$, the term $\\arctan(x)$ approaches $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Therefore, the asymptotic behavior of $f(x)$ is similar to that of the function $g(x) = \\frac{1}{x^p}$. Let's formalize this with the Limit Comparison Test. We compute the limit of the ratio of the two functions:\n$$ L_2 = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{\\arctan(x)}{x^p}}{\\frac{1}{x^p}} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\arctan(x) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\nSince the limit $L_2$ is a finite positive number ($0  L_2  \\infty$), the integral $I_2$ converges if and only if the integral $\\int_1^\\infty g(x) dx = \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{x^p} dx$ converges. By the p-integral test, this integral converges if and only if $p > 1$.\n\nNext, let's analyze the convergence of $I_1 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\arctan(x)}{x^p} dx$. The integral is improper near $x=0$. We again use the Limit Comparison Test. For small $x$, the Maclaurin series for $\\arctan(x)$ is $\\arctan(x) = x - \\frac{x^3}{3} + \\dots$, so $\\arctan(x)$ behaves like $x$ as $x \\to 0^+$. Let's compare the integrand $f(x) = \\frac{\\arctan(x)}{x^p}$ with the function $h(x) = \\frac{x}{x^p} = \\frac{1}{x^{p-1}}$. We compute the limit of their ratio as $x \\to 0^+$:\n$$ L_1 = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{f(x)}{h(x)} = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\frac{\\arctan(x)}{x^p}}{\\frac{x}{x^p}} = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\arctan(x)}{x} $$\nThis limit is an indeterminate form $\\frac{0}{0}$, so we can apply L'Hôpital's Rule:\n$$ L_1 = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\frac{d}{dx}(\\arctan(x))}{\\frac{d}{dx}(x)} = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\frac{1}{1+x^2}}{1} = 1 $$\nSince the limit $L_1$ is a finite positive number ($0  L_1  \\infty$), the integral $I_1$ converges if and only if the integral $\\int_0^1 h(x) dx = \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{x^{p-1}} dx$ converges. By the p-integral test for integrals on $[0, 1]$, this integral converges if and only if the exponent is less than 1. That is, we must have $p-1  1$, which implies $p  2$.\n\nFor the original integral $I(p)$ to converge, both conditions must be satisfied simultaneously. We need $p > 1$ from the analysis at infinity, and $p  2$ from the analysis near zero.\nCombining these two inequalities, we find that the integral converges for all $p$ such that $1  p  2$.\nThe set of all values of $p$ for which the integral converges is therefore the open interval $(1, 2)$.\nThe problem asks for the endpoints $a$ and $b$ of this interval $(a, b)$.\nThus, we have $a=1$ and $b=2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}1  2\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1325475"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond direct computation, this final practice challenges your conceptual understanding of convergence.

To determine which statement is necessarily true, we can test specific examples of functions that satisfy the given conditions. This will allow us to see if the outcome is always the same or if it can vary.\n\nLet's use the p-integral test as a source for our examples. The integral $\\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{x^p} dx$ converges if $p > 1$ and diverges if $p \\leq 1$.\n\nCase 1: Test a function where the new integral might converge.\nLet's choose a function $f(x)$ where its integral converges comfortably. For example, let $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^4}$.\nThe function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^4}$ is continuous and positive for $x \\geq 1$.\nThe integral $\\int_1^\\infty f(x) dx = \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{x^4} dx$ is a p-integral with $p=4$. Since $p > 1$, this integral converges.\nNow, let's examine the integral of the square root of this function:\n$$ \\sqrt{f(x)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{x^4}} = \\frac{1}{x^2} $$\nThe integral in question is $\\int_1^\\infty \\sqrt{f(x)} dx = \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{x^2} dx$.\nThis is a p-integral with $p=2$. Since $p > 1$, this integral also converges.\nThis example demonstrates that it is possible for $\\int_1^\\infty \\sqrt{f(x)} dx$ to converge. This eliminates option B (\"must diverge\").\n\nCase 2: Test a function to see if the new integral can diverge.\nWe need to find a counterexample: a function $f(x)$ such that $\\int_1^\\infty f(x) dx$ converges, but $\\int_1^\\infty \\sqrt{f(x)} dx$ diverges.\nFor the latter integral to diverge, we might try to make $\\sqrt{f(x)}$ behave like a function whose integral is known to diverge, for example, $\\frac{1}{x}$.\nLet's set $\\sqrt{f(x)} = \\frac{1}{x}$. This function is positive and continuous for $x \\geq 1$.\nThe integral of this function is $\\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{x} dx$, which is a p-integral with $p=1$. This integral diverges.\nNow, if $\\sqrt{f(x)} = \\frac{1}{x}$, then we must have $f(x) = \\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{x^2}$.\nLet's check if this choice of $f(x)$ satisfies the initial condition from the problem statement. The function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$ is positive and continuous on $[1, \\infty)$. The integral is $\\int_1^\\infty f(x) dx = \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{x^2} dx$.\nThis is a p-integral with $p=2$. Since $p > 1$, this integral converges.\nSo, we have found a function, $f(x) = 1/x^2$, for which the premise ($\\int f(x) dx$ converges) is true, but the conclusion ($\\int \\sqrt{f(x)} dx$ converges) is false.\nThis example demonstrates that it is possible for $\\int_1^\\infty \\sqrt{f(x)} dx$ to diverge. This eliminates option A (\"must converge\").\n\nConclusion:\nWe have found one case where $\\int_1^\\infty \\sqrt{f(x)} dx$ converges (when $f(x) = 1/x^4$) and another case where it diverges (when $f(x) = 1/x^2$). Both of these examples satisfy the condition that $\\int_1^\\infty f(x) dx$ converges. Therefore, the convergence of $\\int_1^\\infty \\sqrt{f(x)} dx$ is not predetermined; it depends on the specific function $f(x)$. This means that the integral may converge or may diverge.

Option D is incorrect because we have enough information to conclude that the behavior is variable, which is a definitive conclusion about the nature of the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1325476"}]}
