We will check the hypotheses one by one.\n\n1.  **Compactness of the domain:** The domain of the functions is the interval $I = [c, 1]$. According to the Heine-Borel theorem in real analysis, a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. The interval $[c, 1]$ is a closed interval and it is bounded, as for any $x \\in I$, we have $c \\le x \\le 1$. Therefore, the domain $I$ is a compact set. Thus, the statement in option A is incorrect.\n\n2.  **Continuity of the functions $f_n(x)$:** For each positive integer $n$, the function is $f_n(x) = x^{1/n}$. This is a root function, which is a specific type of power function. Since the domain is $I = [c, 1]$ and we are given that $c > 0$, the base $x$ is always strictly positive. For any positive base $x$, the function $g(a) = x^a$ is continuous for all real exponents $a$. Therefore, each function $f_n(x)$ is continuous on the interval $I$. Thus, the statement in option E is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Pointwise convergence to a continuous function:** We need to find the pointwise limit of the sequence, $f(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n(x)$, for each $x \\in [c, 1]$.\n    - If $x = 1$, then $f_n(1) = 1^{1/n} = 1$ for all $n$. The limit is $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n(1) = 1$.\n    - If $x \\in [c, 1)$, we can rewrite the function using the exponential and natural logarithm: $f_n(x) = x^{1/n} = \\exp(\\ln(x^{1/n})) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\ln(x)\\right)$.\n    As $n \\to \\infty$, we have $\\frac{1}{n} \\to 0$. For any fixed $x \\in [c, 1)$, $\\ln(x)$ is a fixed negative constant. Therefore, the exponent approaches zero: $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n}\\ln(x) = 0$.\n    Since the exponential function $t \\mapsto \\exp(t)$ is continuous, we can take the limit inside:\n    $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n(x) = \\exp\\left(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n}\\ln(x)\\right) = \\exp(0) = 1$.\n    So, for all $x \\in [c, 1]$, the sequence $\\{f_n(x)\\}$ converges pointwise to the constant function $f(x) = 1$.\n    The limit function $f(x) = 1$ is continuous on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, and therefore it is continuous on the interval $I = [c, 1]$. The hypothesis of pointwise convergence to a continuous function is satisfied. Thus, the statement in option B is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Monotonicity of the sequence $\\{f_n(x)\\}$:** We must check if for each fixed $x \\in [c, 1]$, the sequence of numbers $\\{f_n(x)\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ is monotonic (either non-increasing or non-decreasing).\n    Let's compare $f_n(x) = x^{1/n}$ with $f_{n+1}(x) = x^{1/(n+1)}$.\n    The exponents are related by $n  n+1$, which implies $\\frac{1}{n} > \\frac{1}{n+1}$.\n    - If $x = 1$, then $f_n(1) = 1$ for all $n$. The sequence is constant, which is a form of monotonicity (both non-increasing and non-decreasing).\n    - If $x \\in [c, 1)$, we have $0  x  1$. For such a base, the exponential function $y \\mapsto x^y$ is a strictly decreasing function of $y$.\n    Since $\\frac{1}{n} > \\frac{1}{n+1}$, it follows that $x^{1/n}  x^{1/(n+1)}$.\n    This means $f_n(x)  f_{n+1}(x)$ for all $n$ and for all $x \\in [c, 1)$.\n    Therefore, the sequence $\\{f_n(x)\\}$ is a (strictly) increasing sequence for each $x \\in [c, 1)$ and a constant sequence for $x=1$. In all cases, the sequence is non-decreasing. This satisfies the monotonicity hypothesis. Thus, the statement in option C is incorrect.\n\nSince all hypotheses of Dini's theorem (compact domain, continuity of $f_n$, pointwise convergence to a continuous function $f$, and monotonicity of the sequence) are satisfied, the theorem is applicable. This allows us to conclude that the convergence of $f_n$ to $f$ is, in fact, uniform on the interval $I$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2297300"}]}
