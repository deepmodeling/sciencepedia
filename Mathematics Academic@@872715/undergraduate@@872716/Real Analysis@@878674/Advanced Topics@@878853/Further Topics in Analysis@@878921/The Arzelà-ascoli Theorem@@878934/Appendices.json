For any function $f_n(z) = z^n$ in $\\mathcal{F}_1$, we can evaluate its magnitude:\n$$|f_n(z)| = |z^n| = |z|^n$$\nSince $|z| \\leq 1$, we have $|z|^n \\leq 1^n = 1$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.

For a family to be equicontinuous, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there must exist a single $\\delta > 0$ that works for all functions in the family. Let's test this by trying to find a counterexample. Let's choose $\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{2}$.

This means that for any $\\delta$, we can find a sufficiently large integer $N$ such that for all $n > N$, $(1 - \\frac{\\delta}{2})^n  \\frac{1}{2}$. For such an $n$, we have:\n$$|1 - (1 - \\frac{\\delta}{2})^n| > 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} = \\epsilon$$\nThis shows that no single $\\delta$ can work for all $n$ when $\\epsilon = 1/2$.

Let $\\epsilon > 0$ be given. We need to find a $\\delta > 0$ that works for all $g_n \\in \\mathcal{F}_2$. Let's consider the difference $|g_n(z_1) - g_n(z_2)|$ for any two points $z_1, z_2 \\in D$:\n$$|g_n(z_1) - g_n(z_2)| = \\left|\\frac{z_1^n}{n} - \\frac{z_2^n}{n}\\right| = \\frac{1}{n}|z_1^n - z_2^n|$$\nWe use the algebraic identity $a^n - b^n = (a-b)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + \\dots + b^{n-1})$.\n$$|z_1^n - z_2^n| = |z_1 - z_2| \\cdot |z_1^{n-1} + z_1^{n-2}z_2 + \\dots + z_2^{n-1}|$$\nBy the triangle inequality, and since $|z_1| \\leq 1$ and $|z_2| \\leq 1$:\n$$|z_1^{n-1} + z_1^{n-2}z_2 + \\dots + z_2^{n-1}| \\leq |z_1|^{n-1} + |z_1|^{n-2}|z_2| + \\dots + |z_2|^{n-1} \\leq \\underbrace{1 + 1 + \\dots + 1}_{n \\text{ terms}} = n$$\nSubstituting this back into our expression for $|g_n(z_1) - g_n(z_2)|$:\n$$|g_n(z_1) - g_n(z_2)| = \\frac{1}{n}|z_1^n - z_2^n| \\leq \\frac{1}{n} |z_1 - z_2| \\cdot n = |z_1 - z_2|$$\nThis inequality, $|g_n(z_1) - g_n(z_2)| \\leq |z_1 - z_2|$, holds for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nNow, to satisfy the definition of equicontinuity, we are given an $\\epsilon > 0$.

The theorem states that a subset of $C(K)$ (where $K$ is a compact metric space, like $[0,1]$) is precompact if and only if it is pointwise bounded and equicontinuous. Let's check these two conditions for $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nFirst, we check for boundedness. It is sufficient to show uniform boundedness, which implies pointwise boundedness. Let $f$ be an arbitrary function in $\\mathcal{F}$. For any $x \\in [0,1]$, we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the condition $f(1/2) = 0$:\n$$ f(x) = f(x) - f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\int_{1/2}^x f'(t) dt $$\nTaking the absolute value, we get:\n$$ |f(x)| = \\left| \\int_{1/2}^x f'(t) dt \\right| \\le \\left| \\int_{1/2}^x |f'(t)| dt \\right| $$\nTo bound this integral, we use Hölder's inequality.

Thus, $|x - 1/2|^{1/q} \\le (1/2)^{1/q}$.\nCombining these bounds, we get:\n$$ |f(x)| \\le M^{1/p} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{1/q} $$\nThis inequality holds for all $x \\in [0,1]$.

This eliminates options A and E.\n\nNext, we check for equicontinuity. Let $\\epsilon > 0$ be given.

By the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem, this implies that $\\mathcal{F}$ is precompact in $C[0,1]$. This supports option C.\n\nFinally, we must consider the distinction between precompact and compact. A set is compact if and only if it is precompact and closed. The space $C[0,1]$ with the supremum norm is a complete metric space. In a complete metric space, a set is compact if and only if it is closed and totally bounded (where total boundedness is equivalent to precompactness). So we need to check if $\\mathcal{F}$ is a closed set in $C[0,1]$.\nConsider a sequence $\\{f_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ in $\\mathcal{F}$ that converges uniformly to a function $f$ in $C[0,1]$.

It is possible to construct a sequence $\\{f_n\\} \\subset \\mathcal{F}$ which converges uniformly to a continuous function $f$ that is not differentiable at some point (e.g., a function with a 'corner'). Such a limit function $f$ would be in the closure of $\\mathcal{F}$ but not in $\\mathcal{F}$ itself because $f \\notin C^1[0,1]$.\nTherefore, $\\mathcal{F}$ is not a closed subset of $C[0,1]$. Since $\\mathcal{F}$ is not closed, it cannot be compact.
