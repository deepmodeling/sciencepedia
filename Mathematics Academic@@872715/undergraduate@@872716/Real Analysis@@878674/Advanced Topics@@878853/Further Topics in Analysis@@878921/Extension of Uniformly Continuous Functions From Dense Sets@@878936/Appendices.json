Let $x$ be an arbitrary real number. Since $\\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, we can find a sequence of rational numbers $(q_n)$ such that $q_n \\to x$. By the definition of the continuous extension $\\tilde{f}$, we have $\\tilde{f}(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f(q_n)$.\nFrom our assumption, for each term in the sequence $(f(q_n))$, we have $f(q_n) \\ge 0$. The order limit theorem in real analysis states that if a convergent sequence $(a_n)$ has $a_n \\ge c$ for all $n$, then its limit $L$ must satisfy $L \\ge c$. Applying this theorem to the sequence $(f(q_n))$ with $c=0$, we conclude that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f(q_n) \\ge 0$.\nTherefore, $\\tilde{f}(x) \\ge 0$. Since $x$ was an arbitrary real number, this property holds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

We want to determine if $\\tilde{f}(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe order limit theorem for strict inequalities does not hold in general. That is, if $a_n > c$ for all $n$, the limit may be equal to $c$. We can construct a counterexample.\nConsider the function $f: \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(q) = \\min(1, |q - \\sqrt{2}|)$.\nFor any rational number $q$, $q \\neq \\sqrt{2}$, so $|q - \\sqrt{2}| > 0$. Therefore, $f(q) > 0$ for all $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis function is Lipschitz continuous with constant 1 (and thus uniformly continuous).\nThe unique continuous extension of $f$ is $\\tilde{f}(x) = \\min(1, |x - \\sqrt{2}|)$.\nNow, let's evaluate this extension at the irrational point $x = \\sqrt{2}$:\n$\\tilde{f}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\min(1, |\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{2}|) = \\min(1, 0) = 0$.\nThis result is not strictly positive. We have found a uniformly continuous function where $f(q) > 0$ for all $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, but its extension $\\tilde{f}$ is not strictly positive on $\\mathbb{R}$.\nThus, **Property II is false**.\n\n**Analysis of Property III:**\nAssume there exists a constant $M > 0$ such that $|f(q)| \\le M$ for all $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.

Since $x$ was arbitrary, the extension $\\tilde{f}$ is bounded on $\\mathbb{R}$ by the same constant $M$.\nThus, **Property III is true**.\n\n**Analysis of Property IV:**\nAssume there is a non-zero rational number $p$ such that $f(q+p) = f(q)$ for all $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. We want to check if $\\tilde{f}(x+p) = \\tilde{f}(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nLet $x$ be an arbitrary real number. Choose a sequence of rational numbers $(q_n)$ such that $q_n \\to x$.\nNow, consider the point $x+p$. Define a new sequence $(r_n)$ where $r_n = q_n + p$. Since $q_n$ and $p$ are both rational, each $r_n$ is also a rational number.\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, $q_n \\to x$, so $r_n = q_n + p \\to x + p$.\nBy the definition of the extension $\\tilde{f}$ at the point $x+p$, we can use the sequence $(r_n)$:\n$\\tilde{f}(x+p) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f(r_n) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f(q_n+p)$.\nUsing the given periodicity property of $f$ on $\\mathbb{Q}$, we have $f(q_n+p) = f(q_n)$ for every $n$.\nSubstituting this into our expression for $\\tilde{f}(x+p)$:\n$\\tilde{f}(x+p) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f(q_n)$.\nWe also know from the definition of the extension at $x$ that $\\tilde{f}(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f(q_n)$.\nComparing the two results, we have $\\tilde{f}(x+p) = \\tilde{f}(x)$. Since $x$ was an arbitrary real number, this property is preserved.\nThus, **Property IV is true**.\n\nIn summary:\n- Property I is **true**.\n- Property II is **false**.\n- Property III is **true**.\n- Property IV is **true**.\n\nThe correct choice is the one that includes I, III, and IV.
