Finally, we will substitute the given value of $\\epsilon$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the set $E_n(\\epsilon)$. By definition, $E_n(\\epsilon) = \\{x \\in [0,1] : |f_n(x)| \\geq \\epsilon\\}$.\nThe function is $f_n(x) = \\frac{1}{nx+1}$. For $x \\in [0,1]$ and $n \\geq 1$, the term $nx+1$ is always positive. Therefore, $|f_n(x)| = f_n(x)$.\nThe inequality becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{nx+1} \\geq \\epsilon $$\nSince $\\epsilon > 0$ and $nx+1 > 0$, we can take the reciprocal of both sides, which reverses the inequality sign:\n$$ nx+1 \\leq \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} $$\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n$$ nx \\leq \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1 $$\n$$ x \\leq \\frac{1}{n} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1\\right) $$\nThe set $E_n(\\epsilon)$ consists of all $x$ in $[0,1]$ that satisfy this condition.

For such large values of $n$, the set $E_n(\\epsilon)$ is simply the interval $\\left[0, \\frac{1}{n} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1\\right)\\right]$.\nThe Lebesgue measure $\\mu$ of an interval is its length.

By definition, $F_n(\\epsilon) = \\{x \\in [0,1] : |g_n(x)| \\geq \\epsilon\\}$.\nThe function is $g_n(x) = \\exp(-nx)$. Since the exponential function is always positive, $|g_n(x)| = g_n(x)$.\nThe inequality becomes:\n$$ \\exp(-nx) \\geq \\epsilon $$\nThe natural logarithm function, $\\ln$, is strictly increasing, so we can apply it to both sides without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$ \\ln(\\exp(-nx)) \\geq \\ln(\\epsilon) $$\n$$ -nx \\geq \\ln(\\epsilon) $$\nMultiplying by $-1/n$ (a negative number, since $n \\geq 1$) reverses the inequality again:\n$$ x \\leq -\\frac{\\ln(\\epsilon)}{n} $$\nThis can be rewritten as $x \\leq \\frac{\\ln(1/\\epsilon)}{n}$.
