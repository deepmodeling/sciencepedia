A set $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is defined as open if for every point $a \\in A$, there exists an $\\epsilon > 0$ such that the open interval $(a-\\epsilon, a+\\epsilon)$ is entirely contained in $A$. Let's examine the point $x = -1$, which is an element of $S$. For any choice of $\\epsilon > 0$, the open interval centered at $-1$, which is $I = (-1-\\epsilon, -1+\\epsilon)$, must be a subset of $S$ for $S$ to be open. However, this interval $I$ contains points that are less than $-1$. For example, the point $y = -1 - \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}$ is in $I$. Since $y  -1$, the point $y$ is not in $S$. Therefore, no open interval centered at $-1$ is entirely contained in $S$. Because we have found at least one point in $S$ (namely, $-1$) for which the condition of openness fails, the set $S$ is not open. This eliminates options A and C.\n\nNext, let's determine if $S$ is a closed set. A set $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is defined as closed if it contains all of its limit points. A point $p$ is a limit point of a set $S$ if every open interval centered at $p$ contains at least one point of $S$ that is different from $p$. Let us consider the point $p=1$. For any $\\epsilon > 0$, consider the open interval $J = (1-\\epsilon, 1+\\epsilon)$. We need to check if this interval contains any points from $S$. Let's pick a point $z = 1 - \\frac{\\delta}{2}$ where $\\delta = \\min(1, \\epsilon)$. This point $z$ satisfies $0 \\le 1 - \\delta  z  1$, which means $z \\in S$. The point $z$ is also in the interval $J$ and is different from $p=1$. Since for any $\\epsilon > 0$, the open interval around $p=1$ contains a point from $S$, the point $p=1$ is a limit point of $S$. However, the definition of $S$ is $\\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid -1 \\le x  1 \\}$, so the point $p=1$ is not an element of $S$. Since $S$ does not contain all of its limit points (it fails to contain the limit point $1$), the set $S$ is not closed.
