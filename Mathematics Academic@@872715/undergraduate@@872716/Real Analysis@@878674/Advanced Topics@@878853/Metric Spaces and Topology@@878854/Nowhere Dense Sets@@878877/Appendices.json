Let's analyze the set $S$ based on this definition. We need to compute the interior of the closure of $S$, which is $\\text{int}(\\text{cl}(S))$.\n\nFirst, we determine the closure of $S$, denoted $\\text{cl}(S)$. A standard theorem in topology states that for any two sets $X_1$ and $X_2$ in topological spaces, the closure of their Cartesian product is the product of their closures: $\\text{cl}(X_1 \\times X_2) = \\text{cl}(X_1) \\times \\text{cl}(X_2)$.\n\nApplying this theorem to our set $S = A \\times [0, 1]$, we get:\n$$ \\text{cl}(S) = \\text{cl}(A \\times [0, 1]) = \\text{cl}(A) \\times \\text{cl}([0, 1]) $$\nThe set $[0, 1]$ is a closed interval on the real line $\\mathbb{R}$. By definition, a set is closed if it is equal to its closure. Thus, $\\text{cl}([0, 1]) = [0, 1]$.\nSubstituting this back, the closure of $S$ is:\n$$ \\text{cl}(S) = \\text{cl}(A) \\times [0, 1] $$\n\nNext, we need to find the interior of this set, $\\text{int}(\\text{cl}(S)) = \\text{int}(\\text{cl}(A) \\times [0, 1])$.\n\nWe are given that $A$ is a nowhere dense subset of $\\mathbb{R}$. By definition, this means that the interior of the closure of $A$ is empty:\n$$ \\text{int}(\\text{cl}(A)) = \\emptyset $$\n\nNow, let's assume for the sake of contradiction that the interior of $\\text{cl}(S)$ is not empty, i.e., $\\text{int}(\\text{cl}(A) \\times [0, 1]) \\neq \\emptyset$.\nIf the interior of a set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is non-empty, it must contain a basis element of the standard topology on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The basis elements are open rectangles of the form $U \\times V$, where $U$ and $V$ are non-empty open intervals in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSo, if $\\text{int}(\\text{cl}(A) \\times [0, 1])$ is non-empty, there must exist open intervals $U, V \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ such that:\n$$ U \\times V \\subset \\text{int}(\\text{cl}(A) \\times [0, 1]) $$\nThis inclusion implies that $U \\times V \\subset \\text{cl}(A) \\times [0, 1]$.\nFrom the properties of Cartesian products, this entails two separate inclusions:\n1. $U \\subset \\text{cl}(A)$\n2. $V \\subset [0, 1]$\n\nLet's focus on the first inclusion, $U \\subset \\text{cl}(A)$. Since $U$ is an open set in $\\mathbb{R}$, this means that $\\text{cl}(A)$ contains a non-empty open set $U$. Any open set contained in a set $K$ must, by definition, be a subset of the interior of $K$. Therefore, $U \\subset \\text{int}(\\text{cl}(A))$.\nSince $U$ is a non-empty open interval, this implies that $\\text{int}(\\text{cl}(A))$ must be non-empty.\n\nHowever, this contradicts our initial premise that $A$ is a nowhere dense set in $\\mathbb{R}$, which requires $\\text{int}(\\text{cl}(A)) = \\emptyset$.\nOur assumption that $\\text{int}(\\text{cl}(S))$ is non-empty must therefore be false.\n\nWe conclude that the interior of the closure of $S$ is empty:\n$$ \\text{int}(\\text{cl}(S)) = \\emptyset $$\nThis is precisely the definition of a nowhere dense set. Therefore, $S = A \\times [0, 1]$ is a nowhere dense subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. $S$ is a dense set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This would mean $\\text{cl}(S) = \\mathbb{R}^2$, which is clearly false since $\\text{cl}(S) = \\text{cl}(A) \\times [0,1]$ is a strict subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. So, A is incorrect.\nB. The closure of $S$, $\\text{cl}(S)$, contains a non-empty open ball of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. A set containing an open ball is equivalent to its interior being non-empty. We have just shown that $\\text{int}(\\text{cl}(S)) = \\emptyset$. So, B is incorrect.\nC. $S$ is an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This is not generally true. For example, if $A$ is the Cantor set, $A$ is closed, and $[0,1]$ is closed. Their product $S$ would be a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. A non-empty set cannot be both open and closed in a connected space like $\\mathbb{R}^2$ unless it is $\\mathbb{R}^2$ itself. So, C is incorrect.\nD. The interior of the closure of $S$, $\\text{int}(\\text{cl}(S))$, is the empty set. This matches our derivation exactly. So, D is correct.\nE. $S$ is a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This is not generally true. $S = A \\times [0,1]$ is closed if and only if $A$ is closed. While some nowhere dense sets are closed (like the Cantor set), many are not (like $A = \\{1/n : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, which is nowhere dense but not closed because $0 \\in \\text{cl}(A)$ but $0 \\notin A$). Thus, this statement is not always true. So, E is incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2308798"}]}
