The derived condition is $k = g^{-1}h$. We can see that $k^2 = (gh^{-1})(gh^{-1})$. Using the equivalence we just found, we can substitute $g^{-1}h$ for the first $gh^{-1}$: $k^2 = (g^{-1}h)(gh^{-1}) = g^{-1}(hg)h^{-1}$. This does not immediately simplify to $e$.\nHowever, the condition $gh^{-1} = g^{-1}h$ is equivalent to $g^2=h^2$.

But if $|G|=2$, say $G=\\{e, a\\}$ with $a^2=e$, then $\\phi(e)=\\phi(a)=e$ and the map is not injective. So this condition is not general enough.\n- C: If $g^2=e$ for all $g \\in G$, then $\\phi$ maps every element to the identity. This is not injective unless $G$ is the trivial group.\n- E: If $G$ is cyclic, for example $G = \\mathbb{Z}/2n\\mathbb{Z}$ for $n \\ge 1$, the element $n$ has order 2 (unless $n=0$).
