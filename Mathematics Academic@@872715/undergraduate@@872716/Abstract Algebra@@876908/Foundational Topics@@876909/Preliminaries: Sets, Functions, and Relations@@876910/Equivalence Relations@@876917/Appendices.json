Each state can be represented by a binary string of length 10, where '1' signifies a switch is in the 'on' position and '0' signifies it is 'off'. For example, the string `1010000000` represents a state where the first and third switches are 'on' and all others are 'off'.\n\nDefine a relation $\\sim$ on the set $S$. For any two states $s_1, s_2 \\in S$, we say $s_1 \\sim s_2$ if the total number of switches in the 'on' position is the same for both states. It can be shown that this relation $\\sim$ is an equivalence relation, which partitions the set $S$ into disjoint equivalence classes.\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of distinct equivalence classes and let $M$ be the size (i.e., cardinality) of the largest possible equivalence class.

The relation $s_1 \\sim s_2$ holds if and only if the strings $s_1$ and $s_2$ have the same number of '1's. This means that all strings within a single equivalence class have the same number of '1's, and any two strings from different equivalence classes must have a different number of '1's. Therefore, each equivalence class is uniquely defined by the number of '1's its members contain.\n\nThe strings are of length 10. The number of '1's in a string, let's call this number $k$, can be any integer from 0 (the string `0000000000`) to 10 (the string `1111111111`). The set of possible values for $k$ is $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$. Since each distinct value of $k$ corresponds to exactly one equivalence class, the total number of equivalence classes $N$ is the number of elements in this set. Counting the elements, we find there are $10 - 0 + 1 = 11$ possible values. Thus, $N = 11$.\n\nNext, let's determine the size of the largest equivalence class, $M$. The size of an equivalence class corresponding to a specific count of $k$ '1's is the total number of strings of length 10 that contain exactly $k$ '1's. This is a standard combinatorial problem: we need to choose $k$ positions for the '1's out of the 10 available positions. The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{10}{k}$.\n\nTo find $M$, we need to find the maximum value of $\\binom{10}{k}$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 10\\}$. The values of the binomial coefficients $\\binom{n}{k}$ are symmetric about $k = n/2$ and achieve their maximum value at the center. For $n=10$, this maximum occurs at $k = 10/2 = 5$. We need to calculate the value of $\\binom{10}{5}$.\n\n$$ \\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{10!}{5!(10-5)!} = \\frac{10!}{5!5!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} $$\n\nWe can simplify the expression by canceling terms:\n$$ \\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{(5 \\times 2) \\times (3 \\times 3) \\times (4 \\times 2) \\times 7 \\times 6}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 2 \\times 9 \\times 2 \\times 7 = 252 $$\nThus, the size of the largest equivalence class is $M=252$.\n\nFor confirmation, we can also calculate the sizes of the neighboring classes:\n$\\binom{10}{4} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 10 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 210$.\nBy symmetry, $\\binom{10}{6} = \\binom{10}{4} = 210$.\nSince $252 > 210$, our maximum is correct.\n\nThe pair $(N, M)$ is therefore $(11, 252)$.

This exercise [@problem_id:1616271] challenges you to investigate a natural relation from group theory: commutativity.

Therefore, the relation is reflexive.\n\nSymmetric: Suppose $g_{1} \\sim g_{2}$, i.e., $g_{1}g_{2} = g_{2}g_{1}$. By symmetry of equality, $g_{2}g_{1} = g_{1}g_{2}$, which is exactly $g_{2} \\sim g_{1}$. Therefore, the relation is symmetric.\n\nTransitive: Assume for contradiction that the relation is transitive. Let $e$ denote the identity in $G$. For any $g, h \\in G$, we have $g \\sim e$ because $ge = eg = g$, and $e \\sim h$ because $eh = he = h$. By the assumed transitivity, this would imply $g \\sim h$ for all $g, h \\in G$, which means $gh = hg$ for all $g, h \\in G$, so $G$ would be abelian.

The problem states this is an equivalence relation and asks to identify a correct description of one of its equivalence classes for the specific vector space $V = \\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nAn equivalence class $[W]$ for a subspace $W \\in S(V)$ is defined as the set of all subspaces $W' \\in S(V)$ such that $W' \\sim W$.

A subspace must contain the origin. While lines that are subspaces must pass through the origin, a general line in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (as understood in geometry) does not necessarily pass through the origin. Thus, this set is a superset of the true equivalence class for dimension 1.\n\nB. **The set containing the x-axis and the y-axis.** This is incorrect. The x-axis and the y-axis are indeed two distinct 1-dimensional subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. However, the equivalence class for dimension 1 consists of *all* 1-dimensional subspaces (all lines through the origin), not just two of them. This option describes a small subset of the equivalence class $C_1$.\n\nC. **The set of all planes in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ that pass through the origin.** This is the correct definition for the set of all 2-dimensional subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This set is precisely the equivalence class $C_2$ corresponding to dimension 2. Therefore, this is a correct description of an equivalence class.\n\nD. **The set containing only the zero vector, $\\{\\vec{0}\\}$.** This is incorrect. This option describes the 0-dimensional subspace itself, not the equivalence class containing it. An equivalence class is a set of subspaces. The equivalence class for dimension 0 is the set $\\{\\{\\vec{0}\\}\\}$, which is a set containing one element, and that element is the zero subspace.\n\nE. **The union of the set of all lines through the origin and the set of all planes through the origin.** This is incorrect. This option describes the union of two distinct equivalence classes, $C_1 \\cup C_2$. Equivalence classes partition the set $S(V)$, meaning they are mutually disjoint. An element from $C_1$ (a line, dimension 1) cannot be in the same class as an element from $C_2$ (a plane, dimension 2) because their dimensions are different.\n\nBased on the analysis, only option C provides an accurate and complete description of one of the equivalence classes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1790718"}]}
