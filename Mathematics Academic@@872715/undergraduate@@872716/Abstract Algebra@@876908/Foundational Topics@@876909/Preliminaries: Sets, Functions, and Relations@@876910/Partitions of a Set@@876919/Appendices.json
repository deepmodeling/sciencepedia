This relation determines which groups of servers must maintain identical copies of the data. The design specifies initial direct communication links between server $S_1$ and server $S_3$, and between server $S_3$ and server $S_5$. The equivalence relation is defined to be the smallest equivalence relation on the set $S$ that includes these direct links (i.e., if two servers have a direct link, they must be equivalent).

An equivalence relation, denoted by `~`, must satisfy three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. The smallest such relation is the equivalence closure of the initial set of pairs $R = \\{(S_1, S_3), (S_3, S_5)\\}$. We need to add the minimum number of pairs to $R$ to satisfy all three properties.\n\n1.  **Initial Pairs**: The relation must contain the pairs corresponding to the direct links, so $S_1 \\sim S_3$ and $S_3 \\sim S_5$.\n\n2.  **Reflexivity**: For any element $x \\in S$, we must have $x \\sim x$. Thus, the relation must include the pairs $(S_1, S_1)$, $(S_2, S_2)$, $(S_3, S_3)$, $(S_4, S_4)$, and $(S_5, S_5)$.\n\n3.  **Symmetry**: For any pair $(x, y)$, if $x \\sim y$, then we must have $y \\sim x$.\n    - Since $S_1 \\sim S_3$, we must add the pair $(S_3, S_1)$, so $S_3 \\sim S_1$.\n    - Since $S_3 \\sim S_5$, we must add the pair $(S_5, S_3)$, so $S_5 \\sim S_3$.\n\n4.  **Transitivity**: For any elements $x, y, z \\in S$, if $x \\sim y$ and $y \\sim z$, then we must have $x \\sim z$.\n    - We have $S_1 \\sim S_3$ and $S_3 \\sim S_5$. By transitivity, we must have $S_1 \\sim S_5$.\n    - Now that we have $S_1 \\sim S_5$, we must also satisfy symmetry for this new pair, which means we must have $S_5 \\sim S_1$.\n    - Let's check if any other new pairs are generated.\n        - $(S_3, S_1)$ and $(S_1, S_3) \\implies (S_3, S_3)$, which is already included by reflexivity.\n        - $(S_1, S_3)$ and $(S_3, S_1) \\implies (S_1, S_1)$, also included.\n        - $(S_3, S_1)$ and $(S_1, S_5) \\implies (S_3, S_5)$, which is one of the initial pairs.\n        - $(S_5, S_1)$ and $(S_1, S_3) \\implies (S_5, S_3)$, which we added for symmetry.\n    - The set of related elements $\\{S_1, S_3, S_5\\}$ is now closed under transitivity. Any two elements in this set are related to each other.\n\nThe elements $S_2$ and $S_4$ are not related to any other elements except themselves through the reflexive property.\n\nNow we can determine the equivalence classes. An equivalence class $[x]$ for an element $x \\in S$ is the set of all elements $y \\in S$ such that $y \\sim x$.\n- The equivalence class of $S_1$ is $[S_1] = \\{y \\in S \\mid y \\sim S_1\\}$. From our analysis, $S_1 \\sim S_1$, $S_3 \\sim S_1$, and $S_5 \\sim S_1$. Thus, $[S_1] = \\{S_1, S_3, S_5\\}$.\n- Since $S_3$ and $S_5$ are in the same class as $S_1$, their equivalence classes are identical: $[S_3] = [S_5] = \\{S_1, S_3, S_5\\}$.\n- The equivalence class of $S_2$ is $[S_2] = \\{y \\in S \\mid y \\sim S_2\\}$. Only $S_2$ is related to itself. So, $[S_2] = \\{S_2\\}$.\n- Similarly, the equivalence class of $S_4$ is $[S_4] = \\{S_4\\}$.\n\nA partition of a set is a collection of non-empty, disjoint subsets whose union is the original set. The set of distinct equivalence classes forms such a partition.\nThe distinct equivalence classes are $\\{S_1, S_3, S_5\\}$, $\\{S_2\\}$, and $\\{S_4\\}$.\nThe partition is therefore $\\{\\{S_1, S_3, S_5\\}, \\{S_2\\}, \\{S_4\\}\\}$.\n\nComparing this result with the given choices:\nA) $\\{\\{S_1, S_3\\}, \\{S_3, S_5\\}, \\{S_2\\}, \\{S_4\\}\\}$: This is not a partition because the sets are not disjoint; $\\{S_1, S_3\\}$ and $\\{S_3, S_5\\}$ both contain $S_3$.\nB) $\\{\\{S_1, S_3, S_5\\}, \\{S_2, S_4\\}\\}$: This incorrectly groups $S_2$ and $S_4$, which are not related.\nC) $\\{\\{S_1, S_3, S_5\\}, \\{S_2\\}, \\{S_4\\}\\}$: This matches our derived partition.\nD) $\\{\\{S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4, S_5\\}\\}$: This would only be correct if all elements were related to each other.\nE) $\\{\\{S_1\\}, \\{S_2\\}, \\{S_3\\}, \\{S_4\\}, \\{S_5\\}\\}$: This is the partition for the identity relation where each element is only related to itself.\n\nThus, the correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1812640"}, {"introduction": "Partitions don't just arise from abstract relations; they appear naturally in the context of functions.
