Determine the total number of distinct equivalence classes.", "solution": "The problem defines an equivalence relation $\\sim$ on the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ by $a \\sim b$ if and only if $a^2 \\equiv b^2 \\pmod{20}$. We are asked to find the number of distinct equivalence classes.\n\nAn equivalence class of an integer $a$, denoted by $[a]$, is the set of all integers $b$ such that $a \\sim b$. By definition of the relation, this means:\n$$[a] = \\{b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid b^2 \\equiv a^2 \\pmod{20}\\}$$\nAll elements within a single equivalence class have squares that are congruent to the same value modulo 20. Conversely, if two integers $c$ and $d$ have squares that are congruent to different values modulo 20 (i.e., $c^2 \\not\\equiv d^2 \\pmod{20}$), then they cannot belong to the same equivalence class.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct equivalence classes is equal to the number of distinct possible values that $a^2 \\pmod{20}$ can take as $a$ ranges over all integers. Let's call this set of values $S$. The number of equivalence classes is $|S|$.\n$$S = \\{k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 19\\} \\mid \\exists a \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\text{ such that } a^2 \\equiv k \\pmod{20}\\}$$\nThe value of $a^2 \\pmod{20}$ depends only on the value of $a \\pmod{20}$.

For any integer $k$, we have $(20-k)^2 = 20^2 - 40k + k^2 \\equiv k^2 \\pmod{20}$. This means that the square of $k$ and the square of $20-k$ are the same modulo 20. For example, $19^2 \\equiv (20-1)^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\pmod{20}$, $18^2 \\equiv 2^2 \\pmod{20}$, and so on.

For example, $11^2 \\equiv 9^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{20}$, and $15^2 \\equiv 5^2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{20}$.\n\nThe set of all possible values for $a^2 \\pmod{20}$ is $S = \\{0, 1, 4, 5, 9, 16\\}$.\nEach of these distinct values corresponds to a unique equivalence class. For example, the equivalence class corresponding to the value 4 is $[2] = \\{a \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid a^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{20}\\}$.\n\nThe total number of distinct equivalence classes is the number of elements in the set $S$.
