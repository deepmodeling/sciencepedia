In set notation, this corresponds to finding the cardinality of the set of elements that are not in $A$ and not in $B$. This set is the intersection of the complements of $A$ and $B$, which is denoted by $A^c \\cap B^c$.\n\nWe can use De Morgan's laws for sets, which states that for any two sets $A$ and $B$, $(A \\cup B)^c = A^c \\cap B^c$.\nTherefore, we need to find $|(A \\cup B)^c|$.\n\nThe formula for the cardinality of the complement of a set is $|S^c| = |U| - |S|$. Applying this, we get:\n$|A^c \\cap B^c| = |(A \\cup B)^c| = |U| - |A \\cup B|$.\n\nTo find $|A \\cup B|$, we use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion:\n$|A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|$.\n\nNow we calculate the cardinality of each set:\n1.  **$|A|$**: The number of integers in $U$ divisible by 3.
