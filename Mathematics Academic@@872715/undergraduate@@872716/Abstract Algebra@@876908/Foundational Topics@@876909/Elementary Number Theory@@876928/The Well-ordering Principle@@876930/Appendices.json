This problem guides you through the logical steps required to prove that an equation like $x^3 = 3y^3$ is impossible for positive integers $x$ and $y$. By following the argument, you will see firsthand how assuming the existence of a *least* integer solution leads directly to a contradiction, demonstrating the power and structure of proofs based on the Well-ordering Principle. [@problem_id:1841650]", "problem": "A student is attempting to demonstrate that the equation $x^3 = 3y^3$ has no solutions where $x$ and $y$ are positive integers. They employ an argument based on the well-ordering principle, which asserts that every non-empty set of positive integers contains a least element.\n\nThe student's argument proceeds as follows:\n1.  Assume for the sake of contradiction that the set of positive integers $x$ for which there exists a positive integer $y$ satisfying $x^3 = 3y^3$ is non-empty. Let this set be denoted by $S$.\n2.  By the well-ordering principle, $S$ must contain a least element. Let's call this smallest element $x_0$.\n3.  By definition of the set $S$, there must exist a corresponding positive integer $y_0$ such that $x_0^3 = 3y_0^3$.\n4.  From this equation, we can see that $x_0^3$ is a multiple of 3. For the purposes of this problem, you may assume the property that for any integer $k$ and prime number $p$, if $k^3$ is a multiple of $p$, then $k$ is also a multiple of $p$. Therefore, $x_0$ must be a multiple of 3.\n5.  This means we can write $x_0 = 3x_1$ for some positive integer $x_1$.\n6.  Substituting this expression for $x_0$ back into the equation from step 3 gives: $(3x_1)^3 = 3y_0^3$.\n7.  Simplifying the equation yields $27x_1^3 = 3y_0^3$, which reduces to $y_0^3 = 9x_1^3$.\n\nThe student wants to continue the argument to reach a contradiction with the initial assumption. Which of the following statements represents the correct and most direct logical continuation of the student's argument, using the equation from step 7?\n\nA. From $y_0^3 = 9x_1^3$, we can deduce that $y_0^3$ is a multiple of 3, which implies $y_0$ is a multiple of 3. This allows us to define a new integer $y_1$ such that $y_0 = 3y_1$.\n\nB. From $y_0^3 = 9x_1^3$, we can deduce that $y_0$ must be a multiple of 9. This allows us to define a new integer $y_1$ such that $y_0 = 9y_1$.\n\nC. Since $x_0$ was the smallest integer in the set $S$, and we have found an integer $x_1$ such that $x_0 = 3x_1$ (implying $x_1  x_0$), we have already reached a contradiction.\n\nD. The equation $y_0^3 = 9x_1^3$ only holds if $x_1 = 0$ and $y_0 = 0$. This contradicts the requirement that $x$ and $y$ be positive integers.\n\nE. The argument is flawed because the assumption made in step 4 is incorrect; $x_0^3$ being a multiple of 3 does not necessarily imply $x_0$ is a multiple of 3.", "solution": "Assume toward contradiction that there exist positive integers $x,y$ with $x^{3}=3y^{3}$, and let $S=\\{x\\in \\mathbb{Z}_{0}:\\exists y\\in \\mathbb{Z}_{0},\\, x^{3}=3y^{3}\\}$.

This problem moves beyond just the logical structure of infinite descent and requires you to engage with the algebraic mechanics of constructing a \"smaller\" solution from a hypothetical minimal one. By working through the parameterization of Pythagorean triples, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the constructive power of this proof method.

Assume there is a hypothetical solution $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ in positive integers, for which $z_0$ is the smallest possible value for which such a solution exists. For such a minimal solution, it can be shown that $x_0$ and $y_0$ must be coprime, and one must be even and the other odd.\n\nThe construction of a new, smaller solution $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ proceeds through a series of parameterizations based on the properties of primitive Pythagorean triples.

This choice implies that $x_1^4+y_1^4$ is also a perfect square, let's say $z_1^2$.\n\nYour task is to use this construction to find an explicit relationship.
