For a given integer $N > 1$, consider the sequence of $N$ integers defined by $a_k = (N+1)! + k + 1$ for $k=1, 2, \\dots, N$.\nLet $p_k$ denote the smallest prime factor of the integer $a_k$.\nFor the specific case where $N=10$, calculate the numerical value of the sum $S = \\sum_{k=1}^{10} p_k$. The final answer must be a single integer.", "solution": "The problem asks for the sum $S = \\sum_{k=1}^{10} p_k$, where $p_k$ is the smallest prime factor of the integer $a_k = (10+1)! + k + 1 = 11! + k+1$ for $k=1, 2, \\ldots, 10$.\n\nLet's analyze a general term $a_k = (N+1)! + k+1$ for $1 \\le k \\le N$. Here, $N=10$.\nLet $d = k+1$. For $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 10\\}$, the value of $d$ is in the set $\\{2, 3, \\ldots, 11\\}$.\nSince $d \\le 11$, $d$ is a factor of $11! = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots d \\cdots 11$.\nAlso, $d$ is trivially a factor of $k+1$.\nSince $d$ divides both $11!$ and $k+1$, it must divide their sum, $a_k = 11! + k+1$.\n\nLet $q = \\text{spf}(k+1)$ be the smallest prime factor of the integer $k+1$.\nSince $q$ divides $k+1$ and $k+1$ divides $a_k$, it follows that $q$ must divide $a_k$.\nThe smallest prime factor of $a_k$ is $p_k$. Since $q$ is a prime factor of $a_k$, we must have $p_k \\le q$. So, $p_k \\le \\text{spf}(k+1)$.\n\nNow, we need to determine if there can be a prime factor of $a_k$ that is smaller than $q = \\text{spf}(k+1)$.\nLet $p$ be a prime such that $p < q$. We will check if $p$ can divide $a_k$.\nBy the definition of $q = \\text{spf}(k+1)$, no prime smaller than $q$ can divide $k+1$. Thus, $p$ does not divide $k+1$, which means $k+1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nSince $p < q = \\text{spf}(k+1)$, and for $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, 10\\}$, $k+1 \\in \\{2, \\dots, 11\\}$, we have $q \\le k+1 \\le 11$.\nTherefore, any such prime $p$ must satisfy $p < 11$. This means $p$ is a factor in the product $11! = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 11$.\nSo, $11!$ is divisible by $p$, which means $11! \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nNow let's analyze $a_k$ modulo $p$:\n$$a_k = 11! + (k+1) \\equiv 0 + (k+1) \\pmod{p}$$\nSince we established that $k+1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, it follows that $a_k \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$.\nThis shows that no prime $p$ smaller than $q = \\text{spf}(k+1)$ can divide $a_k$.\n\nCombining our two findings:\n1. $p_k \\le \\text{spf}(k+1)$\n2. No prime smaller than $\\text{spf}(k+1)$ divides $a_k$.\nThis forces the smallest prime factor of $a_k$ to be exactly $\\text{spf}(k+1)$.\nTherefore, $p_k = \\text{spf}(k+1)$.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to calculating the sum $S = \\sum_{k=1}^{10} \\text{spf}(k+1)$.\nLet's change the index of summation by setting $j = k+1$.
