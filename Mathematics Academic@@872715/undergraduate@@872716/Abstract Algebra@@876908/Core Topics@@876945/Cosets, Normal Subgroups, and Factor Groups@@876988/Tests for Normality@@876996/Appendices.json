An equivalent and often more practical condition is that for every $k \\in K$ and every $h \\in H$, the element $khk^{-1}$ must also be an element of $H$.\n\nLet's apply this definition to our case. The larger group is $K = G \\times G$, and the subgroup is $H = \\{ (x, x) \\mid x \\in G \\}$.\n\nLet an arbitrary element from the group $G \\times G$ be $g' = (a, b)$, where $a, b \\in G$.\nLet an arbitrary element from the subgroup $H$ be $h' = (x, x)$, where $x \\in G$.\n\nFirst, we need to find the inverse of $g'$, which is $g'^{-1}$.

To see this, for any desired $c \\in G$, we can simply choose $a=e$ (the identity element) and $b=c$.

While all cyclic groups are abelian (and thus $H$ would be normal), not all abelian groups are cyclic (e.g., the Klein-4 group). So, normality does not require $G$ to be cyclic, only abelian. The condition \"if and only if\" makes this statement incorrect.\nD. False. The finiteness of the group is irrelevant to the algebraic property of commutativity.
