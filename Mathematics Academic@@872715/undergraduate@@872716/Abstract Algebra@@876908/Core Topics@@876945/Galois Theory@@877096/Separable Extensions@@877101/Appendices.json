Expanding gives $x^{4}+(b+c-a^{2})x^{2}+a(c-b)x+bc$. Matching the zero $x$-coefficient forces either $a=0$ or $b=c$. If $a=0$, then $(x^{2}+b)(x^{2}+c)$ leads to $b+c=-2$ and $bc=25$, which has no rational solutions since $t^{2}+2t+25=0$ has discriminant $-96$. If $b=c$, then the factorization is $(x^{2}+b)^{2}-a^{2}x^{2}$, which requires $b^{2}=25$ and $2b-a^{2}=-2$. For $b=5$ one gets $a^{2}=12\\notin\\mathbb{Q}$; for $b=-5$ one gets $a^{2}=-8$, impossible in $\\mathbb{Q}$.

Any repeated root would be a common root of $f$ and $f'$. Since $f(0)=25$, $f(1)=24$, and $f(-1)=24$, there is no common root, so $\\gcd(f,f')=1$ and $f$ has distinct roots.

A polynomial is separable if and only if it has no repeated roots. A key criterion for separability is that a polynomial $p(x)$ is separable if and only if its greatest common divisor (GCD) with its formal derivative, $p'(x)$, is 1.\n\nThe polynomial is given by $p(x) = x^3 + x^2 + 1 \\in \\mathbb{F}_2[x]$.\n\nFirst, we compute the formal derivative of $p(x)$. The rules of differentiation apply, but the arithmetic for the coefficients is performed in $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n$$p'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 + x^2 + 1)$$\n$$p'(x) = 3x^{3-1} + 2x^{2-1} + 0$$\n$$p'(x) = 3x^2 + 2x$$\n\nNow, we must interpret the coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_2$. In this field, $3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ and $2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. Substituting these values, we get:\n$$p'(x) = (1)x^2 + (0)x = x^2$$\n\nNext, we find the greatest common divisor of $p(x)$ and $p'(x)$, which is $\\gcd(x^3 + x^2 + 1, x^2)$. We can use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials. We divide $p(x)$ by $p'(x)$:\n$$x^3 + x^2 + 1 = (x+1)(x^2) + 1$$\nThe division gives a quotient of $x+1$ and a non-zero remainder of $1$.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm proceeds as follows:\n$\\gcd(p(x), p'(x)) = \\gcd(x^3 + x^2 + 1, x^2)$\nSince $x^3 + x^2 + 1 = (x+1)x^2 + 1$, we have:\n$\\gcd(x^3 + x^2 + 1, x^2) = \\gcd(x^2, 1)$\nThe greatest common divisor of any polynomial and the constant polynomial 1 is 1.\nSo, $\\gcd(p(x), p'(x)) = 1$.\n\nSince the GCD of the polynomial and its derivative is 1, the polynomial $p(x)$ has no repeated roots. This means that all of its roots are distinct.\n\nThe degree of the polynomial $p(x)$ is 3. By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (as it applies to polynomial rings over fields), a polynomial of degree $n$ has exactly $n$ roots in its splitting field, counting multiplicity. Since we have established that there are no repeated roots (i.e., all multiplicities are 1), the polynomial $p(x) = x^3 + x^2 + 1$ must have 3 distinct roots in its splitting field $K$.\n\nAlternatively, one could first check if $p(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.

All finite fields are perfect. Therefore, since $p(x)$ is irreducible over the perfect field $\\mathbb{F}_2$, it must be separable. This confirms that all its roots are distinct.
