## Introduction
In the study of abstract algebra, solving polynomial equations often requires moving beyond familiar number systems like the rationals. This leads to the concept of a field extension, where a base field is enlarged to create a richer structure. This article focuses on algebraic extensions, a particularly important and well-behaved class of [field extensions](@entry_id:153187) that form the bedrock of Galois theory and have far-reaching applications. We will explore the fundamental question of how these extensions are built, measured, and classified, and why this theoretical framework is so powerful.

To achieve this, the article is structured into three main parts. First, under "Principles and Mechanisms," we will delve into the core theory, defining [algebraic elements](@entry_id:153893), minimal polynomials, the [degree of an extension](@entry_id:148122), and the crucial Tower Law that governs their structure. Next, in "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections," we will see how this abstract machinery is applied to solve concrete problems in number theory, construct finite fields, resolve ancient geometric puzzles, and even model modern engineering systems. Finally, the "Hands-On Practices" section provides targeted exercises to help you solidify your understanding of these key concepts, turning theoretical knowledge into practical skill.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In our study of abstract algebra, the concept of a [field extension](@entry_id:150367) is central. We move from a familiar base field, such as the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$, to larger fields that contain solutions to polynomial equations. This chapter delves into the principles and mechanisms governing these extensions, focusing on a particularly important class known as algebraic extensions.

### Algebraic and Transcendental Elements

Let $F$ be a field and $E$ be an extension of $F$. An element $\alpha \in E$ is defined as **algebraic** over $F$ if it is a root of a non-zero polynomial with coefficients in $F$. That is, there exists some $p(x) \in F[x]$, where $p(x)$ is not the zero polynomial, such that $p(\alpha) = 0$.

For example, $\sqrt{3}$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$ because it is a root of the polynomial $x^2 - 3 \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$. Similarly, the imaginary unit $i$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$ as it satisfies $x^2 + 1 = 0$. If an element is not algebraic over $F$, it is called **transcendental** over $F$. A famous example is the number $\pi$, which is transcendental over $\mathbb{Q}$; no non-zero polynomial with rational coefficients has $\pi$ as a root.

An extension $E/F$ is called an **[algebraic extension](@entry_id:155470)** if every element of $E$ is algebraic over $F$. If an extension contains at least one transcendental element, it is not an [algebraic extension](@entry_id:155470). This distinction is fundamental. For instance, the extensions $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})/\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{Q}(i)/\mathbb{Q}$ are algebraic. However, the extension $\mathbb{Q}(\pi)/\mathbb{Q}$, which consists of all rational functions of $\pi$ with rational coefficients, is not an [algebraic extension](@entry_id:155470) because it contains the element $\pi$ itself, which is transcendental over $\mathbb{Q}$ [@problem_id:1776276].

For any [algebraic element](@entry_id:149440) $\alpha$ over a field $F$, there is a unique [monic polynomial](@entry_id:152311) of the smallest possible positive degree in $F[x]$ that has $\alpha$ as a root. This polynomial is called the **minimal polynomial** of $\alpha$ over $F$, often denoted $m_{\alpha, F}(x)$. A crucial property of the minimal polynomial is that it is irreducible over $F$. If it were reducible, say $m(x) = g(x)h(x)$, then $m(\alpha)=0$ would imply $g(\alpha)=0$ or $h(\alpha)=0$, contradicting the minimality of the degree of $m(x)$.

### Simple Extensions and their Structure

The simplest type of [field extension](@entry_id:150367) is a **[simple extension](@entry_id:152948)**, denoted $F(\alpha)$, which is the smallest field containing both $F$ and the element $\alpha$. A key insight is that any such field $F(\alpha)$ can be viewed as a vector space over the field $F$. The **degree** of the extension, denoted $[F(\alpha):F]$, is defined as the dimension of this vector space.

There is a beautiful and direct relationship between the degree of a [simple extension](@entry_id:152948) and the [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598) of its generating element. If $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$, the degree of the extension is precisely the degree of its [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598):
$$[F(\alpha):F] = \deg(m_{\alpha, F}(x))$$
Furthermore, if $d = [F(\alpha):F]$, then a basis for the vector space $F(\alpha)$ over $F$ is given by the set $\{1, \alpha, \alpha^2, \dots, \alpha^{d-1}\}$. This means that any element $\beta \in F(\alpha)$ can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination $\beta = c_0 + c_1\alpha + \dots + c_{d-1}\alpha^{d-1}$ with coefficients $c_i \in F$.

To determine the [degree of an extension](@entry_id:148122), we often rely on irreducibility criteria for polynomials. For example, consider a root $\alpha$ of the polynomial $P(x) = x^5 - 6x + 3 \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$. By Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$ (since 3 divides all coefficients except the leading one, and $3^2=9$ does not divide the constant term 3), this polynomial is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, $P(x)$ must be the [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598) of $\alpha$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. The degree of the extension $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)/\mathbb{Q}$ is thus $\deg(P(x)) = 5$ [@problem_id:1776255].

This principle applies to more complex number systems as well. Let $\zeta_5 = \exp(2\pi i / 5)$ be a primitive 5th root of unity. Its minimal polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$ is the 5th [cyclotomic polynomial](@entry_id:154273), $\Phi_5(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$. Since this polynomial is irreducible and has degree 4, the extension $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_5)/\mathbb{Q}$ has degree 4. A basis for this field as a vector space over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $\{1, \zeta_5, \zeta_5^2, \zeta_5^3\}$. Note that other bases exist; for example, the set $\{\zeta_5, \zeta_5^2, \zeta_5^3, \zeta_5^4\}$ also forms a basis [@problem_id:1776285].

The concept of a minimal polynomial is not limited to extensions over $\mathbb{Q}$. Consider the field $F = \mathbb{Q}(\pi)$, where $\pi$ is transcendental over $\mathbb{Q}$. Let's find the minimal polynomial for the element $\alpha = \sqrt{1+\pi}$ over this field $F$. We can see that $\alpha^2 = 1+\pi$, so $\alpha$ is a root of the polynomial $f(x) = x^2 - (1+\pi)$. The coefficients of this polynomial are $1$ and $-(1+\pi)$, both of which are in $F = \mathbb{Q}(\pi)$. To confirm this is the [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598), we must show it is irreducible over $F$, which requires demonstrating that $\alpha = \sqrt{1+\pi}$ is not an element of $F$. This can be established by showing that $1+\pi$ is not a square of any element in $\mathbb{Q}(\pi)$. An [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127) between $\mathbb{Q}(\pi)$ and the field of [rational functions](@entry_id:154279) $\mathbb{Q}(t)$ maps this problem to showing $1+t$ is not a square in $\mathbb{Q}(t)$, which can be proven using [unique factorization](@entry_id:152313) in the polynomial ring $\mathbb{Q}[t]$. Thus, $x^2 - (1+\pi)$ is indeed the [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598), and $[\mathbb{Q}(\pi)(\sqrt{1+\pi}):\mathbb{Q}(\pi)] = 2$ [@problem_id:1776307].

Finding the minimal polynomial of a more complex number, such as $\alpha = \sqrt{5} + 3i$, often involves algebraic manipulation to eliminate radicals and imaginary units. We can write $x = \sqrt{5} + 3i$, isolate one of the "irrational" parts, $x - 3i = \sqrt{5}$, and square both sides to get $x^2 - 6ix - 9 = 5$. This gives a polynomial with complex coefficients. To obtain a polynomial with rational coefficients, we can group the terms and isolate the imaginary part: $x^2 - 14 = 6ix$. Squaring again yields $(x^2 - 14)^2 = (6ix)^2 = -36x^2$. Expanding and simplifying this equation leads to the polynomial $x^4 + 8x^2 + 196 = 0$. By showing this polynomial is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, we confirm that it is the [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598) of $\sqrt{5} + 3i$, and that $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5}+3i):\mathbb{Q}]=4$ [@problem_id:1776272].

### The Tower Law and Composite Extensions

A cornerstone of the theory of [field extensions](@entry_id:153187) is the **Tower Law**. It states that for any [tower of fields](@entry_id:153606) $F \subseteq K \subseteq L$, the degrees of the extensions are multiplicative:
$$[L:F] = [L:K][K:F]$$
This law is immensely powerful for calculating degrees of more complex extensions.

A direct and profound consequence of the Tower Law is that **every finite extension is an [algebraic extension](@entry_id:155470)**. To see this, let $K/F$ be a finite extension with degree $[K:F] = n$. For any element $\alpha \in K$, consider the set of $n+1$ elements $\{1, \alpha, \alpha^2, \dots, \alpha^n\}$. Since $K$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space over $F$, this set of $n+1$ vectors must be linearly dependent over $F$. Therefore, there exist coefficients $c_0, c_1, \dots, c_n \in F$, not all zero, such that $c_0 + c_1\alpha + \dots + c_n\alpha^n = 0$. This is precisely the definition of $\alpha$ being an [algebraic element](@entry_id:149440) over $F$. Since $\alpha$ was an arbitrary element of $K$, the entire extension $K/F$ is algebraic [@problem_id:1776279].

The Tower Law also provides elegant constraints on [intermediate fields](@entry_id:153550). If an extension $E/F$ has a prime degree, say $[E:F]=p$, then there can be no [intermediate fields](@entry_id:153550) between $E$ and $F$. For any intermediate field $K$, we would have $F \subseteq K \subseteq E$, and by the Tower Law, $[E:F] = [E:K][K:F]=p$. Since $p$ is prime, its only integer factors are 1 and $p$. This implies that either $[K:F]=1$ (so $K=F$) or $[K:F]=p$ (so $[E:K]=1$ and $E=K$). Consequently, for any element $\alpha \in E \setminus F$, the [simple extension](@entry_id:152948) $F(\alpha)$ must be equal to $E$ itself [@problem_id:1776274]. As a practical example, since $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[5]{2}):\mathbb{Q}]=5$, for an element like $\beta = 1 + (\sqrt[5]{2})^2$, we can deduce that $\mathbb{Q}(\beta) = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[5]{2})$ and thus $[\mathbb{Q}(\beta):\mathbb{Q}] = 5$.

When an extension is generated by multiple elements, such as $L = F(\alpha_1, \alpha_2)$, we are dealing with a **composite field**. The degree of such an extension can be found using a formula related to the Tower Law. For two extensions $E_1 = F(\alpha_1)$ and $E_2 = F(\alpha_2)$, the degree of their compositum $E_1 E_2 = F(\alpha_1, \alpha_2)$ is given by:
$$[E_1 E_2 : F] = \frac{[E_1:F][E_2:F]}{[E_1 \cap E_2 : F]}$$
A common scenario occurs when the degrees of the individual extensions are coprime. For example, to calculate the degree of $L = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt[3]{5})$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, we consider the subfields $E_1 = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ and $E_2 = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{5})$. We know $[E_1:\mathbb{Q}]=2$ and $[E_2:\mathbb{Q}]=3$. The intersection $E_1 \cap E_2$ is an intermediate field of both, so its degree over $\mathbb{Q}$ must divide both 2 and 3. Since $\gcd(2,3)=1$, the degree of the intersection must be 1, meaning $E_1 \cap E_2 = \mathbb{Q}$. The formula then simplifies to $[L:\mathbb{Q}] = \frac{2 \cdot 3}{1} = 6$ [@problem_id:1776301].

This machinery allows us to determine the degree of extensions generated by sums of algebraic numbers. Let's analyze $\alpha = \sqrt{3} + \sqrt[3]{7}$. The field $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ is a subfield of the compositum $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt[3]{7})$. As we saw, $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt[3]{7}):\mathbb{Q}]=6$. By the Tower Law, $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt[3]{7}):\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)][\mathbb{Q}(\alpha):\mathbb{Q}]=6$, which implies $[\mathbb{Q}(\alpha):\mathbb{Q}]$ must be a divisor of 6. This provides an upper bound. To establish a lower bound, we can examine the conjugates of $\alpha$. The conjugates of $\sqrt{3}$ are $\pm\sqrt{3}$, and the conjugates of $\sqrt[3]{7}$ are $\sqrt[3]{7}$, $\omega\sqrt[3]{7}$, and $\omega^2\sqrt[3]{7}$, where $\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity. This gives rise to $2 \times 3 = 6$ distinct numbers of the form $\epsilon\sqrt{3} + \zeta\sqrt[3]{7}$ (where $\epsilon \in \{\pm 1\}, \zeta \in \{1, \omega, \omega^2\}$), which are all roots of the [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598) of $\alpha$. Therefore, the degree of the minimal polynomial must be at least 6. Combining the [upper and lower bounds](@entry_id:273322), we conclude that the degree is exactly 6 [@problem_id:1776270].

### Normal Extensions and Closures

While an extension may contain one root of an [irreducible polynomial](@entry_id:156607), it does not necessarily contain all of its roots. An [algebraic extension](@entry_id:155470) $K/F$ is called a **[normal extension](@entry_id:155744)** if for every [irreducible polynomial](@entry_id:156607) $p(x) \in F[x]$ that has at least one root in $K$, all roots of $p(x)$ are in $K$. Equivalently, a finite extension is normal if and only if it is the [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) of some polynomial in $F[x]$. A **[splitting field](@entry_id:156669)** of a polynomial is the smallest extension field over which the polynomial factors completely into linear factors.

Consider the extension $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2})$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. The minimal polynomial of $\alpha = \sqrt[4]{2}$ is $f(x) = x^4 - 2$. The roots of this polynomial in the complex numbers are $\sqrt[4]{2}$, $-\sqrt[4]{2}$, $i\sqrt[4]{2}$, and $-i\sqrt[4]{2}$. The field $K$ is a [subfield](@entry_id:155812) of the real numbers and contains only the two real roots. It does not contain the [complex roots](@entry_id:172941) $i\sqrt[4]{2}$ and $-i\sqrt[4]{2}$. Therefore, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2})/\mathbb{Q}$ is not a [normal extension](@entry_id:155744).

For any finite extension $K/F$ that is not normal, we can construct its **[normal closure](@entry_id:139625)**. This is the smallest [field extension](@entry_id:150367) of $K$ that is normal over $F$. For a [simple extension](@entry_id:152948) $F(\alpha)$, its [normal closure](@entry_id:139625) is simply the [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) of the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $F$. In our example, the [normal closure](@entry_id:139625) of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2})$ is the [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) of $x^4-2$, which is obtained by adjoining all its roots to $\mathbb{Q}$. This field is $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}, i\sqrt[4]{2}) = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}, i)$ [@problem_id:1776262].

It is crucial to distinguish the concept of a [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) or [normal closure](@entry_id:139625) from that of an **[algebraic closure](@entry_id:151964)**. A [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) for a given polynomial $f(x)$ is constructed to solve one specific problem: factoring $f(x)$. It is typically a finite extension. For example, the [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) of $x^2-2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$. This field is not **algebraically closed** because other polynomials, such as $x^2-3$, remain irreducible over it. An [algebraic closure](@entry_id:151964) of a field $K$, denoted $\bar{K}$, is a much larger field. It is an [algebraic extension](@entry_id:155470) of $K$ which is itself algebraically closed, meaning *every* non-constant polynomial with coefficients in $\bar{K}$ has a root in $\bar{K}$. For fields like $\mathbb{Q}$, the [algebraic closure](@entry_id:151964) is an infinite-degree extension. Thus, while a [splitting field](@entry_id:156669) provides all roots for one polynomial, an [algebraic closure](@entry_id:151964) provides roots for all polynomials [@problem_id:1775760].
