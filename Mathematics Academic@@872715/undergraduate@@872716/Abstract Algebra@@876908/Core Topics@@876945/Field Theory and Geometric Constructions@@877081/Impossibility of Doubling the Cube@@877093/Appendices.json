Our goal is to find a polynomial with rational coefficients that has $x$ as a root. We can do this by isolating the radical term and eliminating it.\n\n1.  Start with the equation for $x$:\n    $$x = 1 + \\sqrt[3]{2}$$\n\n2.  Isolate the cube root term by subtracting 1 from both sides:\n    $$x - 1 = \\sqrt[3]{2}$$\n\n3.  Cube both sides of the equation to eliminate the cube root:\n    $$(x - 1)^{3} = \\left(\\sqrt[3]{2}\\right)^{3}$$\n    $$(x - 1)^{3} = 2$$\n\n4.  Expand the left side using the binomial expansion $(a-b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3$:\n    $$x^{3} - 3(x^{2})(1) + 3(x)(1^{2}) - 1^{3} = 2$$\n    $$x^{3} - 3x^{2} + 3x - 1 = 2$$\n\n5.  Move all terms to one side to form a polynomial equation with a root at $x=\\beta$:\n    $$x^{3} - 3x^{2} + 3x - 3 = 0$$\n\nSo, $\\beta$ is a root of the polynomial $p(x) = x^{3} - 3x^{2} + 3x - 3$. To be sure this is the *minimal* polynomial, we must check if $p(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use the Eisenstein's criterion after a substitution. Let $y = x - 1$. Then $x = y + 1$. Substituting this into our polynomial $p(x)$:\n$$p(y+1) = (y+1)^{3} - 3(y+1)^{2} + 3(y+1) - 3$$\nFrom step 3, we know $(x-1)^3 - 2 = 0$, so with $y=x-1$, this becomes $y^3 - 2 = 0$. So, let $q(y) = p(y+1) = y^3 - 2$.\n\nNow we apply Eisenstein's criterion to $q(y) = y^3 - 2$ with the prime $p=2$.\n- The leading coefficient is 1, which is not divisible by 2.\n- All other coefficients (0 for $y^2$, 0 for $y$, -2 for the constant) are divisible by 2.\n- The constant term, -2, is not divisible by $p^2 = 4$.\n\nSince all conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are met, the polynomial $q(y) = y^3 - 2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. A polynomial $p(x)$ is irreducible if and only if $p(x+c)$ is irreducible for a constant $c$. Since $q(y)=p(y+1)$ is irreducible, $p(x)$ must also be irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSince $p(x) = x^{3} - 3x^{2} + 3x - 3$ is a monic, irreducible polynomial with rational coefficients that has $\\beta$ as a root, it is the minimal polynomial of $\\beta$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Part 2: Determining if $\\beta$ is a constructible number**\n\nThe problem states that a number $\\alpha$ is constructible if the degree of its minimal field extension, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}]$, is a power of 2. The degree of this extension is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n1.  From Part 1, the minimal polynomial of $\\beta = 1 + \\sqrt[3]{2}$ is $p(x) = x^{3} - 3x^{2} + 3x - 3$.\n\n2.  The degree of this minimal polynomial is 3.\n\n3.  Therefore, the degree of the field extension is $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\beta):\\mathbb{Q}] = 3$.\n\n4.  We must check if this degree is a power of 2. A power of 2 is a number of the form $2^k$ for a non-negative integer $k$ (e.g., $2^0=1, 2^1=2, 2^2=4, \\dots$).\n\n5.  Since 3 is not a power of 2, the number $\\beta = 1 + \\sqrt[3]{2}$ is not a constructible number.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have found that $\\beta$ is a root of the polynomial $p(x) = x^{3} - 3x^{2} + 3x - 3$ and that $\\beta$ is not a constructible number. Comparing this with the given options:\n\n- A: Incorrect, claims $\\beta$ is constructible.\n- B: Correct, states the correct polynomial and that $\\beta$ is not constructible.\n- C: Incorrect, $p(\\beta) = (\\sqrt[3]{2}+1)^3 - 2 \\neq 0$.
