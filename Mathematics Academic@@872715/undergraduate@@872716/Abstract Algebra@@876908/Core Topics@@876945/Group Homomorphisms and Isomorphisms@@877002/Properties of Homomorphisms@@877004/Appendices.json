A homomorphism $\\phi: \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\to H$ is completely determined by the image of its generator, $\\phi(1)$. Once $\\phi(1)$ is chosen, the images of all other elements are fixed by the homomorphism property.

So, we must have $\\phi(0) = (0,0)$.\n\nA further critical property is that the order of the image of an element must divide the order of the element.

Both 1 and 2 are divisors of 4. Therefore, any choice of image for the generator $1$ from the elements of $H$ will satisfy the order condition.

A homomorphism must map the identity element to the identity element. Here, $\\phi(0)=(0,1)$, but the identity element in $H$ is $(0,0)$.

A key property of a group homomorphism is that for any element $g$ in the domain and any integer $n$, we have $\\phi(n \\cdot g) = n \\cdot \\phi(g)$. In our additive group context, this is written as $\\phi(nx) = n\\phi(x)$.\n\nLet's define an integer $k = \\phi(1)$.

Then $k = 2m$. This equation implies that $k$, the value of $\\phi(1)$, must be an even integer. One might be tempted to conclude that any even integer is a possible value for $k$, which would imply $\\phi(1/2)=m$ could be any integer, leading to option A. However, we must consider other rational numbers.\n\nLet's generalize this argument. For any non-zero integer $n$, consider the rational number $1/n \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. We have the relation $n \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} = 1$. Applying the homomorphism $\\phi$:\n$$ \\phi\\left(n \\cdot \\frac{1}{n}\\right) = \\phi(1) $$\n$$ n \\cdot \\phi\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right) = k $$\nThis means $\\phi(1/n) = k/n$. Since $\\phi(1/n)$ must be an integer for any non-zero integer $n$, it must be the case that $k/n$ is an integer for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. This is a very strong condition on $k$. It means that the integer $k$ must be divisible by every non-zero integer.\n\nThe only integer that is divisible by every non-zero integer (e.g., divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, ...) is the integer 0. Therefore, we must have $k=0$.\n\nSo, for any homomorphism $\\phi: (\\mathbb{Q}, +) \\to (\\mathbb{Z}, +)$, it must be that $\\phi(1) = 0$.\n\nNow we can determine the value of $\\phi(1/2)$. Using our earlier result:\n$$ k = 2 \\cdot \\phi\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) $$\nSubstituting $k=0$:\n$$ 0 = 2 \\cdot \\phi\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ \\phi\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 0 $$\nThis shows that for any valid homomorphism $\\phi$, the value of $\\phi(1/2)$ must be 0.
