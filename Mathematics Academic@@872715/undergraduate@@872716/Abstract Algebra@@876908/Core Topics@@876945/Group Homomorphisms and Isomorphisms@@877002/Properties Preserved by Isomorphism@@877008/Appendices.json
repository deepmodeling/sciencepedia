This is a cyclic group of order $n = p^2$. A fundamental theorem concerning cyclic groups states that for every positive divisor $d$ of the order $n$, there exists exactly one subgroup of order $d$. The positive divisors of $p^2$ are $1$, $p$, and $p^2$. We are interested in subgroups of order $p$. Since $p$ is a divisor of $p^2$, there is precisely one subgroup of order $p$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}$. Therefore, we have $N_G = 1$.\n\nNext, let's analyze the group $H = \\mathbb{Z}_p \\times \\mathbb{Z}_p$. This is an abelian group of order $p^2$. We are looking for the number of subgroups of order $p$. Since $p$ is a prime number, any group of order $p$ is cyclic. Thus, we are counting the number of cyclic subgroups of order $p$ in $H$.

Our strategy will be to count the number of elements of order $p$ in $H$ and then determine how many of these elements generate the same subgroup.\n\nAn element in $H$ is of the form $(a, b)$, where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$. The order of an element $(a, b)$ is the least common multiple of the orders of $a$ and $b$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. The group $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ has order $p$, so the order of any element in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ must divide $p$. The identity element $0$ has order $1$, and all other $p-1$ elements have order $p$.\nThe order of $(a, b) \\in H$ will be $1$ if and only if both $a$ and $b$ have order $1$, which means $a=0$ and $b=0$. So, only the identity element $(0, 0)$ has order 1. All other elements in $H$ must have order $p$.\nThe total number of elements in $H$ is $p \\times p = p^2$.\nThe number of elements of order $p$ is the total number of elements minus the number of elements of order 1. This gives $p^2 - 1$ elements of order $p$.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many distinct subgroups these elements generate. Each subgroup of order $p$ is cyclic and is generated by any of its non-identity elements. Since the subgroup has order $p$ (a prime), all of its $p-1$ non-identity elements are generators. These subgroups partition the set of all elements of order $p$.\nTherefore, the number of distinct subgroups of order $p$, $N_H$, is the total number of elements of order $p$ divided by the number of generators per subgroup.\n$$N_H = \\frac{\\text{Number of elements of order } p}{\\text{Number of generators per subgroup of order } p} = \\frac{p^2 - 1}{p - 1}$$\nWe can simplify the expression for $N_H$ by factoring the numerator:\n$$N_H = \\frac{(p - 1)(p + 1)}{p - 1} = p + 1$$\n\nWe have found that $N_G = 1$ and $N_H = p + 1$.
