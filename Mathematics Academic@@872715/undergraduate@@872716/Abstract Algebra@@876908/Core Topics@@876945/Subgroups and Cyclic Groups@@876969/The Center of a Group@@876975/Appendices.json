Since $G$ is generated by $a$ and $b$, an element $z\\in G$ is central if and only if it commutes with both $a$ and $b$.\n\nFirst, observe that conjugation by $b$ inverts powers of $a$. From $bab=a^{-1}$, we prove by induction that\n$$\nb a^{k} b = a^{-k} \\quad \\text{for all integers } k.\n$$\nThe base case $k=1$ is the given relation. If it holds for $k$, then\n$$\nb a^{k+1} b = (b a^{k} b)(b a b) = a^{-k} a^{-1} = a^{-(k+1)}.\n$$\nFor negative $k$, the identity follows by inversion.

For $i\\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$,\n- $a^{i}$ commutes with $a$ trivially.\n- For $a^{i}$ to commute with $b$, we need $b a^{i} = a^{i} b$. Using $b a^{i} = a^{-i} b$, this requires $a^{-i} b = a^{i} b$, hence $a^{-i} = a^{i}$, i.e.,\n$$\na^{2i} = e.\n$$\nSince $a^{4}=e$, this condition holds exactly when $i$ is even, so $i=0$ or $i=2$. Thus among the powers of $a$, precisely $e$ and $a^{2}$ commute with $b$. Therefore $e$ and $a^{2}$ commute with both generators $a$ and $b$, so $e,a^{2}\\in Z(G)$.\n\nNext, consider elements of the form $a^{i} b$. Check commutation with $a$:\n$$\na(a^{i} b) = a^{i+1} b, \\qquad (a^{i} b) a = a^{i} (b a) = a^{i} (a^{-1} b) = a^{i-1} b.\n$$\nEquality would force $a^{i+1} b = a^{i-1} b$, hence $a^{i+1} = a^{i-1}$ and thus $a^{2} = e$, which contradicts the fact that $a$ has order $4$ by the relation $a^{4}=e$.
