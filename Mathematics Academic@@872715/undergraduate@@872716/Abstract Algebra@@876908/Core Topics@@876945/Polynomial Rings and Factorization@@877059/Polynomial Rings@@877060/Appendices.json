A polynomial of degree 2 or 3 is reducible over a field $F$ if and only if it has a root in $F$.\n\n1.  Consider the factor $q_1(x) = x^2 - 3$. The roots of $q_1(x) = 0$ are $x = \\pm\\sqrt{3}$. Since $\\sqrt{3}$ is an irrational number, it is not an element of the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.

Therefore, $x^2 + 3$ has no roots in $\\mathbb{Q}$ and is also irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSince both factors are irreducible in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$, the complete factorization of $p(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is:\n$$F_{\\mathbb{Q}} = (x^2 - 3)(x^2 + 3)$$\n\n**Part 2: Factorization over $\\mathbb{R}$ ($F_{\\mathbb{R}}$)**\nWe now analyze the irreducibility of the factors $x^2 - 3$ and $x^2 + 3$ using real coefficients. In $\\mathbb{R}[x]$, any irreducible polynomial must have degree 1 or 2.\n\n1.  Consider the factor $q_1(x) = x^2 - 3$. Its roots are $x = \\pm\\sqrt{3}$. Since $\\sqrt{3}$ is a real number, it is an element of the field $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $x^2 - 3$ has roots in $\\mathbb{R}$ and is reducible over $\\mathbb{R}$. The factorization is:\n    $$x^2 - 3 = (x - \\sqrt{3})(x + \\sqrt{3})$$\n    Both $(x - \\sqrt{3})$ and $(x + \\sqrt{3})$ are degree-1 polynomials and are therefore irreducible over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2.
