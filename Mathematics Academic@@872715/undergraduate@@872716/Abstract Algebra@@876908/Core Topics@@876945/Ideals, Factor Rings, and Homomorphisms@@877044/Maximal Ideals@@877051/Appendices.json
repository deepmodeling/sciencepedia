A fundamental result in ring theory states that the ideals of the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the positive divisors of $n$. Specifically, for each positive divisor $d$ of $n$, the set $I = \\langle d \\rangle = \\{kd \\pmod n \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ is an ideal, and these are all the ideals of $\\mathbb{Z}_n$.\n\nFirst, we list the positive divisors of 18.

An ideal $M$ in a ring $R$ is called maximal if $M \\neq R$ and the only ideals strictly containing $M$ are $R$ itself. For the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_n$, there is a specific criterion for maximality: an ideal $\\langle d \\rangle$ is a maximal ideal of $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ if and only if the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Z}_n / \\langle d \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_d$ is a field. This condition is met if and only if $d$ is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, to find the maximal ideals of $\\mathbb{Z}_{18}$, we need to find the ideals $\\langle d \\rangle$ where $d$ is a prime divisor of 18.\n\nThe prime factorization of 18 is $18 = 2 \\times 3^2$.

For example, every element in $\\langle 6 \\rangle$ is a multiple of 6, and thus also a multiple of 2, so it belongs to $\\langle 2 \\rangle$.
