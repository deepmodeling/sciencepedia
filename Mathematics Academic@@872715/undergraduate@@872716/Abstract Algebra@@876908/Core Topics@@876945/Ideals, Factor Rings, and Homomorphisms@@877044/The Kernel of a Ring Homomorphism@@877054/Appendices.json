This generator is the minimal polynomial $m_{A}(x)$ of $A$, defined as the unique monic polynomial of least degree with $m_{A}(A)=0$.\n\nBy the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, $A$ satisfies its characteristic polynomial. The characteristic polynomial of $A$ is computed as follows. For an indeterminate $t$, we have\n$$\n\\chi_{A}(t)=\\det(tI-A)=\\det\\begin{pmatrix}t & 9 \\\\ -1 & t\\end{pmatrix}=t^{2}+9.\n$$\nTherefore, $A$ satisfies $\\chi_{A}(A)=A^{2}+9I=0$.

The only monic divisors of $x^{2}+9$ in $\\mathbb{R}[x]$ are $1$, $x^{2}+9$, and linear factors $x-\\lambda$ if $x^{2}+9$ had real roots. Since $x^{2}+9$ has no real roots, there is no nonconstant real linear factor dividing it. Moreover, $m_{A}(x)$ cannot be constant, and it cannot be linear, because if $m_{A}(x)=x-\\lambda$, then $A=\\lambda I$, which is false. Therefore the only possibility is\n$$\nm_{A}(x)=x^{2}+9.\n$$\n\nFinally, for any $p\\in\\mathbb{R}[x]$, division by $m_{A}(x)$ yields $p=q m_{A}+r$ with $\\deg r<\\deg m_{A}$. Then $p(A)=0$ implies $r(A)=0$, which by minimality of $m_{A}$ forces $r=0$.
