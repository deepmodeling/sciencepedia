Since 11 and 13 are coprime integers, we can apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The single congruence $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{143}$ is equivalent to the system of two congruences:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11} \\\\\nx^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nLet's solve each congruence separately.\n\nFor the first congruence, $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$:\nSince 11 is a prime number, a polynomial of degree 2 can have at most two roots in the field $\\mathbb{Z}_{11}$. By inspection, the solutions are $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ and $x \\equiv -1 \\pmod{11}$. The second solution can be written as $x \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$.\n\nFor the second congruence, $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$:\nSimilarly, since 13 is a prime number, the solutions are $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$ and $x \\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}$.

There are $2 \\times 2 = 4$ possible systems of linear congruences to solve for $x$:\n\nCase 1: $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ and $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$.\nBy inspection, the unique solution modulo $11 \\times 13 = 143$ is $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{143}$.\n\nCase 2: $x \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$ and $x \\equiv 12 \\pmod{13}$.\nThis is equivalent to $x \\equiv -1 \\pmod{11}$ and $x \\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}$.\nBy inspection, the unique solution modulo 143 is $x \\equiv -1 \\pmod{143}$, which is $x \\equiv 142 \\pmod{143}$.\n\nCase 3: $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ and $x \\equiv 12 \\pmod{13}$.\nFrom the second congruence, we can write $x = 13k + 12$ for some integer $k$.\nSubstituting this into the first congruence:\n$$13k + 12 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$$\n$$2k + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$$\n$$2k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$$\nSince $\\gcd(2, 11) = 1$, we can divide by 2 to get $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\nThis means $k$ must be a multiple of 11, so we can write $k = 11j$ for some integer $j$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $x$:\n$$x = 13(11j) + 12 = 143j + 12$$\nSo, the solution is $x \\equiv 12 \\pmod{143}$.\n\nCase 4: $x \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$ and $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$.\nFrom the second congruence, we can write $x = 13k + 1$ for some integer $k$.\nSubstituting this into the first congruence:\n$$13k + 1 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$$\n$$2k + 1 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$$\n$$2k \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$$\nTo solve for $k$, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 11. Since $2 \\times 6 = 12 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, the inverse of 2 is 6.\nMultiplying both sides by 6:\n$$6 \\times (2k) \\equiv 6 \\times 9 \\pmod{11}$$\n$$12k \\equiv 54 \\pmod{11}$$\n$$k \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$$\nThis means $k$ can be written as $k = 11j + 10$ for some integer $j$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $x$:\n$$x = 13(11j + 10) + 1 = 143j + 130 + 1 = 143j + 131$$\nSo, the solution is $x \\equiv 131 \\pmod{143}$.\n\nCombining all four cases, we have found four distinct solutions for $x$ in the range $1 \\le x < 143$.
