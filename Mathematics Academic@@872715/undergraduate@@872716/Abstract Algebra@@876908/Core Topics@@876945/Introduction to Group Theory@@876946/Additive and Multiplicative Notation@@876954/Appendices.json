The same group structure can be described using multiplicative notation (e.g., $g \\cdot h$, $g^{-1}$) or additive notation (e.g., $a+b$, $-a$), and it's crucial to be able to switch between them. This first exercise focuses on that direct translation, challenging you to convert a defining relation of a non-abelian group into its additive form, a task that underscores the importance of maintaining the order of operations. [@problem_id:1774965]", "problem": "In the study of abstract algebra, a group's operation can be written using different notations. The two most common are multiplicative notation and additive notation. In multiplicative notation, the group operation is denoted by juxtaposition (e.g., $xy$), the inverse of an element $x$ is $x^{-1}$, and the identity is $e$. In additive notation, the operation is denoted by '+' (e.g., $x+y$), the inverse of $x$ is $-x$, and the identity is $0$. It is crucial to remember that for a non-abelian group, $x+y$ is not necessarily equal to $y+x$.\n\nConsider a non-abelian group $G$ with elements $a$ and $b$.
