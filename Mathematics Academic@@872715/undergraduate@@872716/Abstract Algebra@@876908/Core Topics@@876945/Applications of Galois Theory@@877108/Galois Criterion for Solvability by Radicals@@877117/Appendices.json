The multiplication is governed by the identity element $1$, the central element $-1$ which squares to $1$, and the relations $i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$. These relations imply further multiplication rules such as $ij = k$, $ji = -k$, $jk = i$, $kj = -i$, $ki = j$, and $ik = -j$. The inverse of any element $x \\in \\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$ is $-x$.\n\nFor any group $G$, its derived series is a sequence of subgroups defined recursively. The series starts with $G^{(0)} = G$. The next term in the series, $G^{(n+1)}$, is the commutator subgroup of the previous term, $G^{(n)}$. The commutator subgroup of a group $H$, often denoted $[H, H]$, is the subgroup generated by the set of all its commutators, where a commutator of two elements $x, y \\in H$ is defined as $[x, y] = xyx^{-1}y^{-1}$.\n\nThe derived length of a group $G$ is the smallest non-negative integer $d$ for which the $d$-th derived subgroup, $G^{(d)}$, is the trivial group $\\{1\\}$ (where $1$ is the identity element of $G$).
