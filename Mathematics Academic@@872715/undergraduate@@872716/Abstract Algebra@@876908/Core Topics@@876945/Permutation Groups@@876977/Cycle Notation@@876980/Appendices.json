Let $\\sigma \\in S_{n}$ and let a cycle of $\\sigma$ have length $\\ell$. Then for any integer $m \\geq 1$, the permutation $\\sigma^{m}$ decomposes that cycle into $\\gcd(\\ell,m)$ disjoint cycles, each of length $\\ell/\\gcd(\\ell,m)$. This follows because, writing the cycle as $(a_{1}\\ a_{2}\\ \\dots\\ a_{\\ell})$, the map $\\sigma^{m}$ sends $a_{i} \\mapsto a_{i+m}$ (indices modulo $\\ell$), whose orbit length is $\\ell/\\gcd(\\ell,m)$, and there are exactly $\\gcd(\\ell,m)$ such orbits.\n\nSpecializing to $m=2$:\n- If $\\ell$ is odd, then $\\gcd(\\ell,2)=1$, so a cycle of odd length remains a single cycle of the same length in $\\sigma^{2}$.\n- If $\\ell$ is even, write $\\ell=2k$, then $\\gcd(\\ell,2)=2$, so a cycle of length $2k$ becomes a product of two disjoint cycles, each of length $k$, in $\\sigma^{2}$.\n\nConsequences:\n1. Any even-length cycles in $\\sigma^{2}$ must arise in pairs of the same length, coming from even-length cycles in $\\sigma$ that are twice as long. In particular, a single $k$-cycle with $k$ even cannot appear alone in $\\sigma^{2}$.\n2. In $S_{6}$, the only possible cycle lengths of $\\sigma$ are in $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. Squaring yields:\n   - $1$-cycles stay $1$-cycles,\n   - $2$-cycles become two $1$-cycles (i.e., vanish as nontrivial cycles),\n   - $3$-cycles stay $3$-cycles,\n   - $4$-cycles become two $2$-cycles,\n   - $5$-cycles stay $5$-cycles,\n   - $6$-cycles become two $3$-cycles.\n   Hence $\\sigma^{2}$ in $S_{6}$ cannot contain any $4$-cycle at all, because producing a $4$-cycle under squaring would require an $8$-cycle in $\\sigma$, which cannot exist in $S_{6}$.\n\nNow consider $\\pi = (1\\ 2\\ 3\\ 4)(5\\ 6) \\in S_{6}$. The cycle decomposition of $\\pi$ contains one $4$-cycle and one $2$-cycle. By the analysis above, no square $\\sigma^{2}$ in $S_{6}$ can have a $4$-cycle, so it is impossible that $\\sigma^{2}=\\pi$. Equivalently, the necessary condition that, for each even cycle length $k$, the number of $k$-cycles in $\\pi$ must be even (because they arise in pairs under squaring) is violated here: $\\pi$ has one $4$-cycle and one $2$-cycle, both counts odd.\n\nTherefore, no square root $\\sigma \\in S_{6}$ exists with $\\sigma^{2}=\\pi$.
