A group $G$ is defined as simple if its only normal subgroups are the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$ (containing only the identity element) and the group $G$ itself. Sylow's theorems provide powerful tools for analyzing the internal structure of a finite group and determining whether it can be simple.\n\nLet $G$ be a hypothetical simple group with order $|G|=24$. For a prime $p$ that divides the order of $G$, let $n_p$ denote the number of distinct Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$.

Such a group $G$ cannot exist.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the correct conclusion about a hypothetical simple group $G$ of order 24. We will analyze the structure of $G$ using Sylow's theorems to find a contradiction.\n\nFirst, we factor the order of the group: $|G| = 24 = 8 \\times 3 = 2^3 \\times 3^1$. The prime divisors are $p=2$ and $p=3$.\n\nLet's analyze the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, denoted by $n_3$. A Sylow 3-subgroup of $G$ has order 3.\nAccording to Sylow's third theorem, $n_3$ must divide the index of the Sylow 3-subgroup, which is $|G|/3 = 24/3 = 8$. The divisors of 8 are $\\{1, 2, 4, 8\\}$.\nAlso, $n_3$ must satisfy the congruence $n_3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\nCombining these two conditions, the possible values for $n_3$ are $1$ and $4$.\n\nWe are given that $G$ is a simple group. A group is simple if it has no proper non-trivial normal subgroups.\nIf $n_3 = 1$, then the unique Sylow 3-subgroup would be normal in $G$. Since a Sylow 3-subgroup has order 3, it is a proper ($|P| \\neq 24$) and non-trivial ($|P| \\neq 1$) subgroup. The existence of such a normal subgroup would contradict the assumption that $G$ is simple.\nTherefore, if a simple group of order 24 exists, it must have $n_3 = 4$.\n\nNow, let's consider the consequences of having $n_3=4$. Let $S$ be the set of the four distinct Sylow 3-subgroups of $G$. We can define an action of $G$ on the set $S$ by conjugation: for any $g \\in G$ and any Sylow 3-subgroup $P \\in S$, the action is given by $g \\cdot P = gPg^{-1}$. By Sylow's second theorem, this action is transitive, meaning all Sylow 3-subgroups are conjugate to each other.\n\nThis group action induces a group homomorphism $\\phi: G \\to \\text{Sym}(S)$, where $\\text{Sym}(S)$ is the symmetric group on the set $S$. Since $|S|=4$, the group $\\text{Sym}(S)$ is isomorphic to $S_4$, the symmetric group on 4 elements, which has order $|S_4| = 4! = 24$.\n\nThe kernel of this homomorphism, $\\ker(\\phi) = \\{ g \\in G \\mid gPg^{-1} = P \\text{ for all } P \\in S \\}$, is a normal subgroup of $G$. Since $G$ is assumed to be simple, its only normal subgroups are $\\{e\\}$ and $G$ itself. So, $\\ker(\\phi)$ must be one of these two.\n\nLet's check if $\\ker(\\phi)$ can be $G$. If $\\ker(\\phi) = G$, it means every element of $G$ normalizes every Sylow 3-subgroup. This would imply that each of the four Sylow 3-subgroups is normal in $G$, which in turn means $n_3=1$, not 4. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, we must have $\\ker(\\phi) = \\{e\\}$.\n\nBy the First Isomorphism Theorem, $G/\\ker(\\phi)$ is isomorphic to the image of $\\phi$, which is a subgroup of $\\text{Sym}(S)$. With $\\ker(\\phi) = \\{e\\}$, this gives $G \\cong \\text{Im}(\\phi)$. Since $\\text{Im}(\\phi)$ is a subgroup of $\\text{Sym}(S) \\cong S_4$ and $|G|=24$, while $|S_4|=24$, it must be that the image is the entire group, i.e., $\\text{Im}(\\phi) \\cong S_4$.\nThus, our hypothetical simple group $G$ must be isomorphic to $S_4$.\n\nHowever, the symmetric group $S_4$ is not simple. It contains a proper non-trivial normal subgroup, the alternating group $A_4$, which consists of all even permutations in $S_4$. The order of $A_4$ is $|A_4| = |S_4|/2 = 24/2 = 12$. Since $A_4$ is a normal subgroup of $S_4$ with an order other than 1 or 24, $S_4$ is not simple.\n\nThis is a fundamental contradiction. Our initial assumption that a simple group of order 24 exists forces the conclusion that this group must be isomorphic to $S_4$, but $S_4$ is not simple. Therefore, the initial assumption must be false. No simple group of order 24 can exist.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. The group $G$ must contain exactly 4 elements of order 3. If a simple group of order 24 existed, it would have $n_3=4$. Since Sylow 3-subgroups have prime order 3, any two distinct such subgroups intersect only at the identity. Thus, the number of elements of order 3 would be $n_3 \\times (3-1) = 4 \\times 2 = 8$. So, statement A is false.\nB. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, $n_3$, must be 1. We showed that if $G$ is simple, $n_3$ cannot be 1. So, statement B is false.\nC. The group $G$ must be isomorphic to the alternating group $A_4$. The order of $A_4$ is 12, not 24. So, statement C is false.\nD. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, $n_2$, must be 1. A Sylow 2-subgroup has order $2^3=8$. If $n_2=1$, this subgroup would be normal, contradicting simplicity. So, statement D is false. (In fact, an analysis for $n_2$ shows $n_2 \\mid 3$ and $n_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, so $n_2=3$).\nE. Such a group $G$ cannot exist. Our entire derivation leads to this conclusion. This statement is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1815464"}]}
