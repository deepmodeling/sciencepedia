Since $|G/N|=3$, the group $G/N$ is of order 3. A Sylow 3-subgroup of $G/N$ must have order 3. Therefore, the only Sylow 3-subgroup is $G/N$ itself.\n4.  **Identify $K/N$ and $K$:** We set $K/N = G/N$.

Since $|G/N|=2$, its Sylow 2-subgroup is $G/N$ itself.\n4.  **Identify $K/N$ and $K$:** We set $K/N = G/N$.

The quotient group $D_{12}/Z(D_{12})$ is isomorphic to $D_6 \\cong S_3$.\n3.  **Sylow Subgroups of $G/N$:** The prime is $p=3$. For a group of order 6, the order of a Sylow 3-subgroup is 3. So, $|K/N|=3$.\n4.  **Identify $|K|$:** The order of the corresponding subgroup $K$ is $|K| = |K/N| \\cdot |N| = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6$.\n5.  **Sylow Subgroups of $G$:** The order of the parent group is $|G|=|D_{12}| = 12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1$. For $p=3$, a Sylow 3-subgroup of $D_{12}$ must have order 3.\n6.  **Check the Claim:** The claim states that $K$ must be a Sylow 3-subgroup of $G$. Here, $K$ has order 6.
