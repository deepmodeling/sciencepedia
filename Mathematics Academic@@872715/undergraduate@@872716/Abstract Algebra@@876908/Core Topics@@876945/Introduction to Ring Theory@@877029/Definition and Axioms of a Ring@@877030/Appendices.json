A non-empty subset $S$ of a ring $(R, +, \\cdot)$ is called a subring if $S$ itself forms a ring under the same operations. A standard test for a subring is the subring test: a non-empty subset $S$ of $R$ is a subring if and only if for all $a, b \\in S$, the elements $a-b$ and $a \\cdot b$ are also in $S$.\n\nConsider the ring of integers $(\\mathbb{Z}, +, \\cdot)$ with the usual addition and multiplication.
