The state of the system at a discrete time step $k$ is represented by a vector $\\vec{x}_k = \\begin{pmatrix} p_1(k) \\\\ p_2(k) \\end{pmatrix}$, where $p_1(k)$ and $p_2(k)$ represent the quantities of the two populations. The evolution of the system is governed by a linear transformation given by the equation $\\vec{x}_{k+1} = A \\vec{x}_k$, where $A$ is a real $2 \\times 2$ matrix.\n\nThrough experimental measurements, it is determined that the trace of matrix $A$ is $6$ and its determinant is $9$.

Substituting these values into the characteristic polynomial equation gives:\n$$p(\\lambda) = \\lambda^2 - 6\\lambda + 9$$\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we set $p(\\lambda) = 0$:\n$$\\lambda^2 - 6\\lambda + 9 = 0$$\nThis is a perfect square trinomial:\n$$(\\lambda - 3)^2 = 0$$\n\nThe only root is $\\lambda = 3$. This means the matrix $A$ has a single eigenvalue, $\\lambda = 3$, with an algebraic multiplicity of 2.\n\nA matrix is diagonalizable if and only if for every eigenvalue, its algebraic multiplicity is equal to its geometric multiplicity. The geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue is the dimension of its corresponding eigenspace, which is the number of linearly independent eigenvectors for that eigenvalue.\n\nThe problem statement explicitly mentions that the matrix $A$ is not diagonalizable. Since there is only one eigenvalue, $\\lambda=3$, its geometric multiplicity must be strictly less than its algebraic multiplicity.\nLet $m_a(\\lambda)$ be the algebraic multiplicity and $m_g(\\lambda)$ be the geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue $\\lambda$. We have:\n$$m_a(3) = 2$$\n$$m_g(3)  m_a(3)$$\nSo, $m_g(3)  2$. Since every eigenvalue must have at least one eigenvector, its geometric multiplicity must be at least 1. Therefore, we must have $m_g(3) = 1$.\n\nThe Jordan Canonical Form (JCF) of a matrix is determined by its eigenvalues and the sizes of the corresponding Jordan blocks. The number of Jordan blocks for a given eigenvalue is equal to its geometric multiplicity. In our case, since $m_g(3) = 1$, there is exactly one Jordan block associated with the eigenvalue $\\lambda = 3$.\n\nThe sum of the sizes of all Jordan blocks for a given eigenvalue must equal its algebraic multiplicity. Since there is only one Jordan block for $\\lambda=3$, its size must be equal to the algebraic multiplicity, which is 2.
