The elementary divisors are the orders of the cyclic groups in the prime-power decomposition of $G$.\n\nFirst, we apply the property that if $n = ab$ with $\\gcd(a, b) = 1$, then the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ is isomorphic to the direct product $\\mathbb{Z}_a \\times \\mathbb{Z}_b$. We apply this to each factor in the definition of $G$.\n\nLet's find the prime factorization of the order of each cyclic group factor.\nFor $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, the order is $12$. The prime factorization of $12$ is $2^2 \\times 3^1 = 4 \\times 3$.

The relations matrix $A$ is constructed by writing the coefficients of the relations as rows. The number of columns equals the number of generators ($n=3$), and the number of rows equals the number of relations ($m=2$).\nThe relations are:\n1. $2x + 4y + 0z = 0$\n2. $0x + 0y + 3z = 0$\n\nThe corresponding relations matrix is:\n$$ A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe will find the SNF of $A$ by applying a sequence of elementary integer row and column operations (swapping rows/columns, multiplying a row/column by -1, and adding an integer multiple of one row/column to another).
