This eliminates option E.\n\nSince $M = \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_6$ is an abelian group, its quotient group $M/K$ must also be abelian. The alternating group $A_4$ (option C) and the dihedral group $D_6$ (option D) are non-abelian groups of order 12.

A finite group is cyclic if and only if it contains an element whose order is equal to the order of the group. Let's test if $M/K$ has an element of order 12.\n\nConsider the element (coset) $(1, 1) + K$ in $M/K$. The order of this element is the smallest positive integer $d$ such that $d \\cdot (1, 1) \\in K$.\nThis means we need to find the smallest integer $d>0$ such that $(d \\cdot 1, d \\cdot 1) = (d \\pmod 4, d \\pmod 6)$ is an element of $K = \\{(0, 0), (2, 3)\\}$.\nThis gives us two cases to check:\n\nCase 1: $(d \\pmod 4, d \\pmod 6) = (0, 0)$\nThis implies $d \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$ and $d \\equiv 0 \\pmod 6$.\nThis condition means $d$ must be a common multiple of 4 and 6. The smallest positive common multiple is the least common multiple: $d = \\text{lcm}(4, 6) = 12$.\n\nCase 2: $(d \\pmod 4, d \\pmod 6) = (2, 3)$\nThis corresponds to the system of linear congruences:\n$d \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$\n$d \\equiv 3 \\pmod 6$\nFrom the first congruence, $d$ must be of the form $d = 4k + 2$ for some non-negative integer $k$.\nSubstituting this into the second congruence gives:\n$4k + 2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 6$\n$4k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$\nWe can check for integer solutions for $k$. The left side, $4k \\pmod 6$, can only take values in $\\{0, 2, 4\\}$ because $4k$ is always even, and $\\gcd(4, 6) = 2$. Specifically, $4(0) \\equiv 0$, $4(1) \\equiv 4$, $4(2) \\equiv 8 \\equiv 2$, $4(3) \\equiv 12 \\equiv 0$, and the pattern repeats. Since the right side is 1 (an odd number), there is no integer $k$ that satisfies this congruence. Thus, this case is impossible.\n\nCombining the results of both cases, the smallest positive integer $d$ for which $d \\cdot (1, 1) \\in K$ is $d=12$.\nTherefore, the element $(1, 1) + K$ has order 12 in the quotient group $M/K$.\nSince $M/K$ is a group of order 12 and it contains an element of order 12, it must be a cyclic group. The only cyclic group of order 12 (up to isomorphism) is $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n\nThus, the quotient module $M/K$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.
