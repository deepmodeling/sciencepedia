By working within the ring of Gaussian integers, $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, and explicitly counting the elements of a quotient ring, you will gain a concrete understanding of the structure of residue classes and verify a key theorem in a tangible case.", "problem": "Consider the ring of Gaussian integers, denoted by $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, which consists of all complex numbers of the form $a+bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers. Let $I$ be the principal ideal generated by the element $3+2i$, written as $I = \\langle 3+2i \\rangle$. This ideal consists of all multiples of $3+2i$ by elements of $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. We are interested in the quotient ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}[i]/I$.\n\nDetermine the number of distinct residue classes in $R$. This value represents the cardinality of the quotient ring, denoted as $|R|$ or $|\\mathbb{Z}[i]/\\langle 3+2i \\rangle|$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the number of elements in the quotient ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}[i]/\\langle 3+2i \\rangle$. The elements of this ring are residue classes of the form $[a+bi]$, where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Two elements $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ are in the same residue class if their difference $x-y$ is an element of the ideal $I = \\langle 3+2i \\rangle$. This is denoted as $x \\equiv y \\pmod{I}$.\n\nThe defining property of the quotient ring is that any element in the ideal $I$ is congruent to zero. In particular, the generator of the ideal, $3+2i$, is congruent to zero.\n$$3+2i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{I}$$\nThis congruence allows us to establish relations between the integer and imaginary parts of the residue classes. From this, we have:\n$$2i \\equiv -3 \\pmod{I}$$\nTo find a congruence involving only integers, we can eliminate the imaginary unit $i$. Squaring both sides of the congruence $2i \\equiv -3 \\pmod{I}$ gives:\n$$(2i)^2 \\equiv (-3)^2 \\pmod{I}$$\n$$4i^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{I}$$\nSince $i^2 = -1$, this becomes:\n$$-4 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{I}$$\nAdding 4 to both sides, we get:\n$$0 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{I}$$\nThis means that the integer $13$ is an element of the ideal $I$. Consequently, for any integer $n$, its residue class $[n]$ in $R$ depends only on its value modulo 13. Specifically, any integer $n$ can be written as $n=13q+r$ where $r \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 12\\}$. Then $[n] = [13q+r] = [13][q]+[r] = [0][q]+[r]=[r]$. This shows that any integer is congruent to one of the integers $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 12\\}$ modulo $I$.\n\nNow we analyze a general element $a+bi \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$. We want to find a simpler representative for its residue class $[a+bi]$. We use the relation $2i \\equiv -3 \\pmod{I}$. To isolate $i$, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of $2$ in the ring of integers modulo $13$, $\\mathbb{Z}_{13}$. The inverse of $2$ modulo $13$ is $7$, because $2 \\times 7 = 14 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$.\n\nWe can multiply the congruence $2i \\equiv -3 \\pmod{I}$ by $7$. Note that this is a valid operation because $13 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{I}$ implies that congruences of integers can be treated as congruences modulo 13.\n$$7(2i) \\equiv 7(-3) \\pmod{I}$$\n$$14i \\equiv -21 \\pmod{I}$$\nSince $14 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$ and $-21 \\equiv -21 + 2 \\times 13 \\equiv -21+26 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{13}$, the congruence simplifies to:\n$$i \\equiv 5 \\pmod{I}$$\nThis crucial result means that within any residue class, we can replace $i$ with the integer $5$. Now we can simplify the class of a general element $a+bi$:\n$$[a+bi] = [a] + [b][i] = [a] + [b][5] = [a+5b]$$\nSince $a+5b$ is an integer, its residue class is congruent to one of the integers $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 12\\}$. Therefore, every element of $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is congruent to one of these 13 integers modulo $I$. This means the set of residue classes is $\\{[0], [1], \\dots, [12]\\}$, and the number of elements is at most 13.\n\nTo confirm that there are exactly 13 elements, we must show that these 13 classes are distinct. Suppose $[j] = [k]$ for some $j, k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 12\\}$ with $j \\neq k$. This implies $j \\equiv k \\pmod{I}$, which means their difference $j-k$ is an element of the ideal $I = \\langle 3+2i \\rangle$.\nSo, for some $c, d \\in \\mathbb{Z}$:\n$$j-k = (c+di)(3+2i)$$\nExpanding the right side gives:\n$$j-k = (3c-2d) + (2c+3d)i$$\nSince $j-k$ is a real integer, the imaginary part of the right side must be zero:\n$$2c+3d = 0$$\nThis implies $2c = -3d$. Since 2 and 3 are coprime, $c$ must be a multiple of 3 and $d$ must be a multiple of 2. Let $c = -3m$ for some integer $m$. Then $2(-3m) = -3d$, which gives $-6m = -3d$, so $d=2m$.\nSubstituting these back into the equation for $j-k$:\n$$j-k = (3(-3m) - 2(2m)) + (2(-3m) + 3(2m))i$$\n$$j-k = (-9m - 4m) + (-6m + 6m)i$$\n$$j-k = -13m$$\nThis shows that if the residue classes of two integers $j$ and $k$ are the same, their difference must be a multiple of 13. For $j, k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 12\\}$, their difference $j-k$ can only be a multiple of 13 if $j-k=0$, which means $j=k$.\nThus, the classes $[0], [1], \\dots, [12]$ are all distinct.\n\nThe quotient ring $\\mathbb{Z}[i]/\\langle 3+2i \\rangle$ has exactly 13 distinct residue classes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{13}$$", "id": "1818862"}, {"introduction": "One of the primary motivations for introducing ideals was to restore the unique factorization that can fail for elements in general rings of integers.

A key result from algebraic number theory states that the norm is completely multiplicative: for any two ideals $I$ and $J$ in $R_d$, $N(IJ) = N(I)N(J)$, where $IJ$ is the ideal product. Furthermore, the function $a(n)$, which counts the number of distinct ideals of norm $n$, is a multiplicative arithmetic function.

Since $N_0=6$ can be factored into coprime integers $2$ and $3$, we have:\n$$a(6) = a(2)a(3)$$\nWe need to compute $a(2)$ and $a(3)$, which are the number of ideals of norm 2 and 3, respectively. An ideal whose norm is a prime number $p$ must be a prime ideal. Therefore, $a(p)$ is the number of prime ideals of norm $p$.\n\nThe structure of prime ideals in $R_5 = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$ is determined by the factorization of principal ideals $(p)$ for rational primes $p$.

The prime $p=2$ divides the discriminant $\\Delta_K = -20$. In this case, the prime $p=2$ ramifies.\nThis means the ideal $(2)$ is the square of a prime ideal of norm 2. Specifically,\n$$(2) = P_2^2$$\nwhere $P_2$ is a prime ideal with $N(P_2) = 2$.\nSince the factorization of $(2)$ only involves one distinct prime ideal factor, $P_2$, there is only one prime ideal of norm 2.\nTherefore, the number of ideals of norm 2 is $a(2)=1$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate $a(3)$, the number of ideals of norm 3.**\nNext, we analyze the factorization of the ideal $(3)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$.

By definition, this means we need to check if $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) = \\mathbb{Q}(2\\sqrt{3})$ is equal to the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$.

For a quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ where $d$ is a square-free integer, the ring of integers is given by:\n- $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ if $d \\equiv 2$ or $3 \\pmod{4}$.\n- $\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}]$ if $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\nIn our case, $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$, so $d=3$.

The elements of this ring are of the form $a + b\\sqrt{3}$ for any integers $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNext, let's characterize the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha] = \\mathbb{Z}[2\\sqrt{3}]$. This ring consists of all polynomial expressions in $\\alpha = 2\\sqrt{3}$ with integer coefficients. Let's find a simpler basis for this ring. The minimal polynomial of $\\alpha = 2\\sqrt{3}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is found by observing $\\alpha^2 = (2\\sqrt{3})^2 = 12$. So, $\\alpha$ is a root of $x^2 - 12 = 0$. Any polynomial in $\\alpha$ can be reduced modulo $x^2-12$. This means any element of $\\mathbb{Z}[2\\sqrt{3}]$ can be written in the form $a' + b'(2\\sqrt{3})$ for some integers $a', b' \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. So, the elements of $\\mathbb{Z}[2\\sqrt{3}]$ are of the form $a' + 2b'\\sqrt{3}$ for $a', b' \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow we compare the two rings:\n$\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{3}] = \\{a + b\\sqrt{3} \\mid a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$\n$\\mathbb{Z}[2\\sqrt{3}] = \\{a' + 2b'\\sqrt{3} \\mid a', b' \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$\n\nIs $\\mathbb{Z}[2\\sqrt{3}] = \\mathcal{O}_K$?\nLet's check for inclusion. Any element $a' + 2b'\\sqrt{3}$ from $\\mathbb{Z}[2\\sqrt{3}]$ is of the form $a+b\\sqrt{3}$ where $a=a'$ and $b=2b'$. Since $a'$ and $b'$ are integers, $a$ and $b$ are also integers. Thus, every element of $\\mathbb{Z}[2\\sqrt{3}]$ is contained in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{3}]$, so $\\mathbb{Z}[2\\sqrt{3}] \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{3}]$.\n\nTo check if the rings are equal, we must see if the reverse inclusion holds. Is $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{3}] \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}[2\\sqrt{3}]$? Let's take an arbitrary element from $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{3}]$ and see if it must be in $\\mathbb{Z}[2\\sqrt{3}]$. Consider the element $\\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{3}]$ (obtained by setting $a=0, b=1$). Can we write $\\sqrt{3}$ in the form $a' + 2b'\\sqrt{3}$ for some integers $a', b'$?\n$$ \\sqrt{3} = a' + 2b'\\sqrt{3} $$\nRearranging gives:\n$$ a' + (2b' - 1)\\sqrt{3} = 0 $$\nSince $1$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (and thus over $\\mathbb{Z}$), the coefficients must be zero. This requires $a'=0$ and $2b' - 1 = 0$. The second equation gives $2b' = 1$, or $b' = 1/2$. This is not an integer. Therefore, there are no integers $a', b'$ that satisfy the condition. This means $\\sqrt{3}$ is in $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{3}]$ but not in $\\mathbb{Z}[2\\sqrt{3}]$.\nConsequently, $\\mathbb{Z}[2\\sqrt{3}]$ is a proper subring of $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{3}]$, and the two are not equal.\nStatement II is **false**.\n\nCombining our findings, Statement I is true and Statement II is false.
