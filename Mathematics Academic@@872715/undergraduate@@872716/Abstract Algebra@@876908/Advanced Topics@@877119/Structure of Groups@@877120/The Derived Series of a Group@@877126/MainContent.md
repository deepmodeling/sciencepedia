## Introduction
The vast landscape of group theory is broadly divided into two realms: the straightforward, commutative world of abelian groups and the complex, richer territory of [non-abelian groups](@entry_id:145211). While the former are well-understood, the latter's intricacy, stemming from the failure of elements to commute, requires sophisticated tools for analysis. How can we systematically measure the degree of [non-commutativity](@entry_id:153545) within a group and use it to classify its structure? This article addresses this fundamental question by introducing the derived series, a powerful algebraic construct that deconstructs a group into a sequence of abelian layers.

Across the following chapters, you will embark on a journey from first principles to profound applications. The "Principles and Mechanisms" chapter will introduce the foundational concepts of the commutator and the derived subgroup, building up to the crucial definition of [solvable groups](@entry_id:145750). Following this, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will explore the impact of the derived series on Galois theory, [representation theory](@entry_id:137998), and even the symmetries found in chemistry and physics. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will offer opportunities to apply these concepts to concrete examples, solidifying your understanding. We begin by defining the essential building block that measures the failure of commutativity: the commutator itself.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The structure of a group is intimately tied to the interplay of its elements under the group operation. While abelian groups possess the simplest structure, where all elements commute, the richness and complexity of group theory arise primarily from the study of [non-abelian groups](@entry_id:145211). To investigate this non-commutative structure, we must first develop a precise tool for quantifying the failure of [commutativity](@entry_id:140240).

### The Commutator and the Derived Subgroup

The fundamental measure of non-commutativity between two elements, $x$ and $y$, in a group $G$ is the **commutator**, defined as:
$$[x, y] = xyx^{-1}y^{-1}$$
The commutator $[x, y]$ is equal to the identity element $e$ if and only if $xy = yx$. Thus, a group $G$ is abelian if and only if the set of all its commutators consists of just the [identity element](@entry_id:139321). For a [non-abelian group](@entry_id:144791), the collection of non-identity commutators provides a window into its internal structural complexity. A commutator $[x, y]$ can be seen as the "correction factor" that relates the products $xy$ and $yx$, since $xy = [x,y]yx$.

While the set of all [commutators](@entry_id:158878), $\{[x, y] \mid x, y \in G\}$, reveals much about the group, this set is not, in general, a subgroup. To obtain a robust algebraic object, we consider the subgroup generated by this set. This leads to one of the most important constructions in group theory.

The **[commutator subgroup](@entry_id:140057)**, or **derived subgroup**, of a group $G$, denoted $G^{(1)}$ or $[G, G]$, is the subgroup generated by the set of all [commutators](@entry_id:158878):
$$G^{(1)} = \langle \{[x, y] \mid x, y \in G\} \rangle$$
An element of $G^{(1)}$ is therefore a finite product of [commutators](@entry_id:158878) and their inverses. The derived subgroup encapsulates the overall non-commutative character of the group.

A crucial property of the derived subgroup is its normality. For any $c \in G^{(1)}$ and any $g \in G$, the conjugate $gcg^{-1}$ is also in $G^{(1)}$. It suffices to check this for a single commutator $[x, y]$:
$$g[x, y]g^{-1} = g(xyx^{-1}y^{-1})g^{-1} = (gxg^{-1})(gyg^{-1})(gx^{-1}g^{-1})(gy^{-1}g^{-1})$$
Recognizing that $(gxg^{-1})^{-1} = gx^{-1}g^{-1}$ and $(gyg^{-1})^{-1} = gy^{-1}g^{-1}$, we can write this as:
$$g[x, y]g^{-1} = [gxg^{-1}, gyg^{-1}]$$
Since $gxg^{-1}$ and $gyg^{-1}$ are elements of $G$, their commutator is, by definition, in the set of generators for $G^{(1)}$. As any element of $G^{(1)}$ is a product of commutators, and conjugation distributes over products, it follows that $G^{(1)}$ is closed under conjugation by any element of $G$. Thus, **the derived subgroup $G^{(1)}$ is always a [normal subgroup](@entry_id:144438) of $G$**. This fact, mentioned in contexts like [@problem_id:1829000] and [@problem_id:1829001], is essential for the constructions that follow.

### The Abelianization of a Group

The normality of $G^{(1)}$ in $G$ allows us to form the quotient group $G/G^{(1)}$. This quotient group has a remarkable property: it is always abelian. To see this, consider two arbitrary elements of $G/G^{(1)}$, which take the form of [cosets](@entry_id:147145) $xG^{(1)}$ and $yG^{(1)}$. Their commutator in the [quotient group](@entry_id:142790) is:
$$[xG^{(1)}, yG^{(1)}] = (xG^{(1)})(yG^{(1)})(xG^{(1)})^{-1}(yG^{(1)})^{-1} = (xyx^{-1}y^{-1})G^{(1)} = [x, y]G^{(1)}$$
Since the commutator $[x, y]$ is an element of $G^{(1)}$ by definition, the coset $[x, y]G^{(1)}$ is the identity element in the quotient group $G/G^{(1)}$. As this holds for any two elements, the [quotient group](@entry_id:142790) $G/G^{(1)}$ is abelian.

This [quotient group](@entry_id:142790) is known as the **[abelianization](@entry_id:140523)** of $G$. It represents the largest possible abelian homomorphic image of $G$. This idea is formalized by a [universal property](@entry_id:145831) [@problem_id:1828952] [@problem_id:1828946]:
**Universal Property of the Commutator Subgroup**: Let $\phi: G \to A$ be a [group homomorphism](@entry_id:140603), where $A$ is an abelian group. Then the commutator subgroup $G^{(1)}$ is a subgroup of the kernel of $\phi$.
The proof is direct: for any commutator $[x, y] \in G^{(1)}$,
$$ \phi([x, y]) = \phi(xyx^{-1}y^{-1}) = \phi(x)\phi(y)\phi(x)^{-1}\phi(y)^{-1} $$
Since the [codomain](@entry_id:139336) $A$ is abelian, $\phi(x)$ and $\phi(y)$ commute. Therefore, $\phi(x)\phi(y)\phi(x)^{-1}\phi(y)^{-1} = e_A$, the identity in $A$. This shows that every commutator is in $\ker(\phi)$. Since $\ker(\phi)$ is a subgroup, the entire subgroup $G^{(1)}$ generated by the commutators must also be contained in $\ker(\phi)$.

This property establishes that $G^{(1)}$ is the smallest normal subgroup of $G$ whose quotient is abelian. Any other [normal subgroup](@entry_id:144438) $N$ for which $G/N$ is abelian must contain $G^{(1)}$. Consequently, the [abelianization](@entry_id:140523) $G/G^{(1)}$ is the canonical "abelian version" of $G$, stripping away all non-commutative information.

### Calculating the Derived Subgroup: Illustrative Examples

To solidify these concepts, we can compute the derived subgroup and abelianization for several representative groups.

Consider the **Heisenberg group over $\mathbb{Z}_3$**, which consists of $3 \times 3$ matrices of the form $X(a,b,c) = \begin{pmatrix} 1  a  b \\ 0  1  c \\ 0  0  1 \end{pmatrix}$ with $a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}_3$ [@problem_id:1828998]. Through direct calculation of the commutator of two elements $x = X(a,b,c)$ and $y = X(a',b',c')$, one finds:
$$[x, y] = X(0, ac' - a'c, 0)$$
The resulting commutator has non-trivial entries only in the $(1,3)$ position. The set of all such [commutators](@entry_id:158878) forms the subgroup $H = \{X(0, b, 0) \mid b \in \mathbb{Z}_3\}$. This is because we can generate any element $X(0, d, 0)$ by choosing appropriate $a, c', a', c$ (e.g., $a=1, c'=d, a'=0, c=0$). This subgroup is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and is the derived subgroup $G^{(1)}$. Its order is 3.

Another important class of examples is the **dihedral groups** $D_{2n}$, the symmetry groups of a regular $n$-gon. With presentation $D_{2n} = \langle r, s \mid r^n = e, s^2 = e, srs = r^{-1} \rangle$, we can compute the commutators of its generators. Using the relation $sr = r^{-1}s$ (which follows from $srs=r^{-1}$ and $s^2=e$) and $s=s^{-1}$, we can compute the commutator $[s,r]$:
$$ [s,r] = srs^{-1}r^{-1} = (srs^{-1})r^{-1} = r^{-1}r^{-1} = r^{-2} $$
Since $[s,r]$ is a commutator, it must be in the derived subgroup $D_{2n}^{(1)}$. Thus, $r^{-2}$ is in $D_{2n}^{(1)}$. As $[r,s] = [s,r]^{-1} = (r^{-2})^{-1} = r^2$, we see that $r^2$ is also in $D_{2n}^{(1)}$. This implies that the [cyclic subgroup](@entry_id:138079) $\langle r^2 \rangle$ is contained in $D_{2n}^{(1)}$. One can further show that the quotient $D_{2n} / \langle r^2 \rangle$ is abelian, which by the [universal property](@entry_id:145831) implies that $D_{2n}^{(1)} \subseteq \langle r^2 \rangle$. Thus, we conclude that $D_{2n}^{(1)} = \langle r^2 \rangle$.

Let's apply this to specific cases:
-   For the group of symmetries of a square, $D_8$ ($n=4$), the derived subgroup is $D_8^{(1)} = \langle r^2 \rangle = \{e, r^2\}$. This subgroup has order 2. The [abelianization](@entry_id:140523) $D_8/D_8^{(1)}$ has order $|D_8|/|D_8^{(1)}| = 8/2 = 4$. The images of the generators $\bar{r}$ and $\bar{s}$ in this quotient both have order 2 and commute. Therefore, $D_8/D_8^{(1)}$ is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, $V_4 \cong \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ [@problem_id:1829001] [@problem_id:1646969].
-   For the group $D_{20}$ ($n=10$), the derived subgroup is $D_{20}^{(1)} = \langle r^2 \rangle$. The order of $r$ is 10, so the order of $r^2$ is $10/\gcd(10,2) = 5$. The order of the largest abelian quotient, $|D_{20}/D_{20}^{(1)}|$, is therefore $20/5 = 4$ [@problem_id:1828946].

### The Derived Series and Solvable Groups

The process of taking a derived subgroup can be iterated. Starting with a group $G$, we can construct a sequence of subgroups, known as the **derived series**.

Let $G^{(0)} = G$. For $i \ge 0$, define recursively:
$$G^{(i+1)} = [G^{(i)}, G^{(i)}]$$
This yields a descending chain of [normal subgroups](@entry_id:147397):
$$ G = G^{(0)} \supseteq G^{(1)} \supseteq G^{(2)} \supseteq \dots $$
Note that while each $G^{(i)}$ is normal in $G$, each $G^{(i+1)}$ is guaranteed to be normal only in its immediate parent, $G^{(i)}$. As established before, the [factor groups](@entry_id:146225) of this series, $G^{(i)}/G^{(i+1)}$, are always abelian.

This series is the key to defining a vast and important class of groups. A group $G$ is called **solvable** if its derived series terminates at the [trivial subgroup](@entry_id:141709), i.e., if there exists an integer $k$ such that $G^{(k)} = \{e\}$. The smallest such non-negative integer $k$ is called the **derived length** of the [solvable group](@entry_id:147558).

The [symmetric group](@entry_id:142255) $S_4$ provides a classic example of a [solvable group](@entry_id:147558) [@problem_id:1828988]. Its derived series is:
1.  $G^{(0)} = S_4$.
2.  $G^{(1)} = [S_4, S_4] = A_4$, the alternating group of order 12. The quotient $S_4/A_4 \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$ is abelian.
3.  $G^{(2)} = [A_4, A_4] = V_4$, the Klein four-group, consisting of the identity and the three double-[transpositions](@entry_id:142115). The quotient $A_4/V_4 \cong \mathbb{Z}_3$ is abelian. An element such as the 3-cycle $(123)$ is in $A_4$ but not in $V_4$, so it belongs to $G^{(1)} \setminus G^{(2)}$.
4.  $G^{(3)} = [V_4, V_4] = \{e\}$, because $V_4$ is an abelian group.

The series $S_4 \supset A_4 \supset V_4 \supset \{e\}$ terminates, proving that $S_4$ is solvable with a derived length of 3.

Another example is the group $G$ of invertible affine transformations on $\mathbb{Z}_{13}$, which are functions $f(x)=ax+b$ with $a \in \mathbb{Z}_{13}^{\times}$ and $b \in \mathbb{Z}_{13}$ [@problem_id:1828989]. Its derived subgroup $G^{(1)}$ is the subgroup of translations $T = \{x \mapsto x+b\}$, which is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{13}$. Since $T$ is abelian, its own derived subgroup is trivial: $G^{(2)} = [G^{(1)}, G^{(1)}] = [T, T] = \{e\}$. The series terminates, so $G$ is solvable with derived length 2. The order of the [factor group](@entry_id:152975) $G^{(1)}/G^{(2)}$ is simply $|T|/|\{e\}| = 13$.

### Non-Solvable Groups and Terminal Subgroups

What if the derived series does not terminate at the [trivial subgroup](@entry_id:141709)? The series must eventually stabilize, meaning there is an index $k$ such that $G^{(k)} = G^{(k+1)} = \dots$. This stable subgroup $G^{(k)}$ is called the **terminal subgroup** of the derived series. Such a subgroup $H=G^{(k)}$ has the property that it is its own commutator subgroup, $H' = H$. A group with this property is called a **[perfect group](@entry_id:145358)**.

The simplest examples of non-[solvable groups](@entry_id:145750) are the non-abelian [simple groups](@entry_id:140851) [@problem_id:1829000]. A group $G$ is **simple** if its only normal subgroups are $\{e\}$ and $G$ itself. If $G$ is a non-abelian [simple group](@entry_id:147614), its derived subgroup $G^{(1)}$ is a [normal subgroup](@entry_id:144438). Since $G$ is non-abelian, $G^{(1)}$ cannot be the [trivial subgroup](@entry_id:141709) $\{e\}$. Therefore, by simplicity, we must have $G^{(1)} = G$. This implies that the group is perfect. By induction, $G^{(n)} = G$ for all $n \ge 1$. The derived series $G \supseteq G \supseteq G \supseteq \dots$ never descends. Such groups are fundamentally non-solvable. The smallest non-abelian simple group, $A_5$, behaves this way.

This property of non-[solvable groups](@entry_id:145750) persists in direct products. The derived subgroup of a direct product is the [direct product](@entry_id:143046) of the derived subgroups: $(H \times K)^{(1)} = H^{(1)} \times K^{(1)}$, and by induction, $(H \times K)^{(i)} = H^{(i)} \times K^{(i)}$. Consider the group $G = S_4 \times A_5$ [@problem_id:1828972]. The derived series for $S_4$ terminates: $S_4^{(3)} = \{e\}$. The derived series for $A_5$ stabilizes: $A_5^{(1)} = A_5$. The derived series for the [product group](@entry_id:276017) $G$ is:
$$ G^{(0)} = S_4 \times A_5 $$
$$ G^{(1)} = A_4 \times A_5 $$
$$ G^{(2)} = V_4 \times A_5 $$
$$ G^{(3)} = \{e\} \times A_5 $$
$$ G^{(4)} = [\{e\} \times A_5, \{e\} \times A_5] = \{e\}^{(1)} \times A_5^{(1)} = \{e\} \times A_5 $$
The series stabilizes at the terminal subgroup $\{e\} \times A_5$. This is a perfect subgroup of $G$ with order $|A_5| = 60$. The non-solvable nature of the $A_5$ factor prevents the entire group from being solvable.

Finally, there exist groups for which the derived series is an infinite, strictly descending chain that never terminates nor stabilizes. A prime example arises from topology. The fundamental group of a torus with two points removed, $G = \pi_1(S \setminus \{p_1, p_2\})$, is isomorphic to the [free group](@entry_id:143667) of rank 3, denoted $F_3$ [@problem_id:1828983].
- The abelianization of $F_3$ is the free [abelian group](@entry_id:139381) of rank 3, so $A_0 = G/G^{(1)} \cong \mathbb{Z}^3$.
- By the Nielsen-Schreier theorem, any subgroup of a free group is itself free. Since the quotient $G/G^{(1)}$ is infinite, the derived subgroup $G^{(1)}$ is a [free group](@entry_id:143667) of countably infinite rank.
- Consequently, its abelianization, $A_1 = G^{(1)}/G^{(2)}$, is a free [abelian group](@entry_id:139381) of countably infinite rank, $A_1 \cong \bigoplus_{\infty} \mathbb{Z}$.
- This reasoning propagates down the series. For all $i \ge 1$, $G^{(i)}$ is a free group of infinite rank, so its derived subgroup $G^{(i+1)}$ is a [proper subgroup](@entry_id:141915), and the abelian factor $A_i = G^{(i)}/G^{(i+1)}$ is a free abelian group of infinite rank.
The derived series for $F_3$ is thus an infinite chain $G \supsetneq G^{(1)} \supsetneq G^{(2)} \supsetneq \dots$ where no term is trivial. Such a group is profoundly non-solvable.

The derived series, therefore, provides a powerful diagnostic tool. It systematically deconstructs a group into a series of abelian layers, revealing a fundamental dichotomy between [solvable groups](@entry_id:145750), which can be fully broken down, and non-[solvable groups](@entry_id:145750), which contain an "unbreakable" perfect core.
