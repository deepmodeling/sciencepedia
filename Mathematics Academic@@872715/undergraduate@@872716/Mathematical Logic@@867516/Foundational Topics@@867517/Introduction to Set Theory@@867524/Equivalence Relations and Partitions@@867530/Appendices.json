If it is, we must compute the cardinality of the quotient set $X/R$. If it is not, the cardinality is to be assigned the value $0$. The given relation is $R=\\{(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4),(1,3),(3,1),(2,4),(4,2)\\}$.\n\nAn equivalence relation is a binary relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. We must verify each of these properties for the relation $R$ on the set $X$.\n\n1.  **Reflexivity**: A relation $R$ on a set $X$ is reflexive if for every element $a \\in X$, the ordered pair $(a,a)$ is in $R$.\n    The set is $X=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. We must check if $(1,1)$, $(2,2)$, $(3,3)$, and $(4,4)$ are all members of $R$.\n    -   Is $(1,1) \\in R$? Yes, it is explicitly listed in the definition of $R$.\n    -   Is $(2,2) \\in R$? Yes, it is explicitly listed.\n    -   Is $(3,3) \\in R$? Yes, it is explicitly listed.\n    -   Is $(4,4) \\in R$? Yes, it is explicitly listed.\n    Since $(a,a) \\in R$ for all $a \\in X$, the relation $R$ is reflexive.\n\n2.  **Symmetry**: A relation $R$ on a set $X$ is symmetric if for every ordered pair $(a,b) \\in R$, the pair $(b,a)$ is also in $R$.\n    We must examine each pair in $R$ and verify this condition.\n    -   For the pairs where the elements are equal, $(1,1)$, $(2,2)$, $(3,3)$, $(4,4)$, the condition is trivially satisfied. For example, for $(1,1) \\in R$, we check if $(1,1) \\in R$, which is true.\n    -   For $(1,3) \\in R$, we must check if $(3,1) \\in R$. Yes, $(3,1)$ is in $R$.\n    -   For $(3,1) \\in R$, we must check if $(1,3) \\in R$. Yes, $(1,3)$ is in $R$.\n    -   For $(2,4) \\in R$, we must check if $(4,2) \\in R$. Yes, $(4,2)$ is in $R$.\n    -   For $(4,2) \\in R$, we must check if $(2,4) \\in R$. Yes, $(2,4)$ is in $R$.\n    Since for every $(a,b) \\in R$, we have $(b,a) \\in R$, the relation $R$ is symmetric.\n\n3.  **Transitivity**: A relation $R$ on a set $X$ is transitive if for every $(a,b) \\in R$ and $(b,c) \\in R$, the pair $(a,c)$ must also be in $R$.\n    We need to check all possible combinations of pairs that form a chain.\n    -   Consider the chain involving elements $1$ and $3$: We have $(1,3) \\in R$ and $(3,1) \\in R$. Transitivity requires that $(1,1) \\in R$. The pair $(1,1)$ is indeed in $R$.\n    -   Consider the chain in the other direction: We have $(3,1) \\in R$ and $(1,3) \\in R$. Transitivity requires that $(3,3) \\in R$. The pair $(3,3)$ is indeed in $R$.\n    -   Consider the chain involving elements $2$ and $4$: We have $(2,4) \\in R$ and $(4,2) \\in R$. Transitivity requires that $(2,2) \\in R$. The pair $(2,2)$ is indeed in $R$.\n    -   Consider the chain in the other direction: We have $(4,2) \\in R$ and $(2,4) \\in R$. Transitivity requires that $(4,4) \\in R$. The pair $(4,4)$ is indeed in $R$.\n    -   Other cases are trivial. For example, if we have $(a,b) \\in R$ and $(b,b) \\in R$, we must check if $(a,b) \\in R$, which is true by assumption. For instance, with $(1,3) \\in R$ and $(3,3) \\in R$, we must check if $(1,3) \\in R$, which is true. Similarly, with $(1,1) \\in R$ and $(1,3) \\in R$, we must check if $(1,3) \\in R$, which is also true.\n    All required conditions for transitivity are met. Therefore, the relation $R$ is transitive.\n\nSince $R$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, it is an equivalence relation on $X$.\n\nNow, we must find the partition of $X$ into $R$-equivalence classes. The equivalence class of an element $a \\in X$, denoted $[a]$, is the set of all elements $x \\in X$ such that $(a,x) \\in R$.\n-   The equivalence class of $1$, denoted $[1]$, is $\\{x \\in X \\mid (1,x) \\in R\\}$. The pairs in $R$ starting with $1$ are $(1,1)$ and $(1,3)$. So, $[1] = \\{1,3\\}$.\n-   The equivalence class of $2$, denoted $[2]$, is $\\{x \\in X \\mid (2,x) \\in R\\}$. The pairs in $R$ starting with $2$ are $(2,2)$ and $(2,4)$. So, $[2] = \\{2,4\\}$.\n-   The equivalence class of $3$, denoted $[3]$, is $\\{x \\in X \\mid (3,x) \\in R\\}$. The pairs in $R$ starting with $3$ are $(3,1)$ and $(3,3)$. So, $[3] = \\{1,3\\}$. We note that $[3] = [1]$.\n-   The equivalence class of $4$, denoted $[4]$, is $\\{x \\in X \\mid (4,x) \\in R\\}$. The pairs in $R$ starting with $4$ are $(4,2)$ and $(4,4)$. So, $[4] = \\{2,4\\}$. We note that $[4] = [2]$.\n\nThe set of distinct equivalence classes forms the quotient set, denoted $X/R$. The distinct classes are $\\{1,3\\}$ and $\\{2,4\\}$.\nTherefore, the quotient set is $X/R = \\{ \\{1,3\\}, \\{2,4\\} \\}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the cardinality of the quotient set, $|X/R|$. The set $X/R$ contains two elements, which are the sets $\\{1,3\\}$ and $\\{2,4\\}$.\nThus, the cardinality is $|X/R| = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is the integer value representing this cardinality.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3041159"}, {"introduction": "A core concept is the fundamental correspondence between equivalence relations and partitions.

It is trivially in the same block as itself, so $xRx$. Thus, $R$ is reflexive.\n\n**Symmetry:**\nIf $xRy$, then $x$ and $y$ are in the same block $S \\in \\mathcal{P}$. This statement is symmetric, so $y$ and $x$ are in the same block $S$. This means $yRx$. Thus, $R$ is symmetric.\n\n**Transitivity:**\nIf $xRy$ and $yRz$, then $x, y$ are in some block $S_1 \\in \\mathcal{P}$ and $y, z$ are in some block $S_2 \\in \\mathcal{P}$. Since $y \\in S_1$ and $y \\in S_2$, the intersection $S_1 \\cap S_2$ is not empty. Because the blocks of a partition are pairwise disjoint, it must be that $S_1 = S_2$. Therefore, $x$ and $z$ are in the same block, which means $xRz$. Thus, $R$ is transitive.\n\nSince $R$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, it is an equivalence relation.\n\nNext, we compute the cardinality of $R$.

The relation is $x \\sim y$ if and only if $\\text{len}(x) = \\text{len}(y)$.\n- **Reflexivity:** For any string $x$, $\\text{len}(x) = \\text{len}(x)$, so $x \\sim x$.\n- **Symmetry:** If $x \\sim y$, then $\\text{len}(x) = \\text{len}(y)$.

This implies $\\text{len}(x) = \\text{len}(z)$, so $x \\sim z$.\nSince the relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, it is an equivalence relation. The partition it induces on $X$ consists of sets of strings of the same length. For each positive integer $n$, there is an equivalence class $C_n = \\{s \\in X \\mid \\text{len}(s) = n\\}$. The quotient set is $X/\\sim = \\{C_1, C_2, C_3, \\dots\\}$.\n\nSecond, we decide whether the rule $f([x])=\\text{the last symbol of }x$ defines a function. For a function on a quotient set to be well-defined, the output must not depend on the choice of representative from the equivalence class. That is, if $[x_1] = [x_2]$, then $f([x_1])$ must equal $f([x_2])$.\nLet's test this with the class $C_2$, which contains all strings of length 2. The strings $x_1 = \"aa\"$ and $x_2 = \"ab\"$ are both in $C_2$, so $[aa] = [ab]$.\nApplying the rule:\n- For the representative \"aa\": $f([aa]) = \\text{the last symbol of \"aa\"} = a$.\n- For the representative \"ab\": $f([ab]) = \\text{the last symbol of \"ab\"} = b$.\nSince we chose two different representatives from the same class and got two different outputs ($a \\neq b$), the rule is dependent on the representative.

We need to find the size of the set of possible last symbols for each equivalence class $C_n$.\nFor any class $C_n$ with $n \\ge 1$:\n- Can a string of length $n$ end in 'a'? Yes, for example, the string of $n$ 'a's. So, $a \\in V(C_n)$.\n- Can a string of length $n$ end in 'b'? Yes, for example, the string of $n$ 'b's. So, $b \\in V(C_n)$.\nThis means for every class $C_n$ (for $n \\ge 1$), the set of possible last symbols is $V(C_n) = \\{a, b\\}$.
