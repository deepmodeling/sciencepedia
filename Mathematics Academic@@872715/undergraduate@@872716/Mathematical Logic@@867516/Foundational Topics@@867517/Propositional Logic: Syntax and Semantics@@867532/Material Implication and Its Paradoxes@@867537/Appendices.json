The argument is structured as follows:\nPremise 1: $P \\to Q$\nPremise 2: $Q$\nConclusion: $P$\n\nThe validity of this argument form is determined by whether there exist any valuations for which all premises are true while the conclusion is false. Such a valuation is called a counterexample. The problem asks for the fraction of all possible valuations on the set of variables $\\{P, Q\\}$ that constitute a counterexample.\n\nIn classical propositional logic with truth values $\\{0, 1\\}$, where $1$ corresponds to \"true\" and $0$ to \"false\", a valuation $v$ is a function that assigns a truth value to each propositional variable. For the two variables $P$ and $Q$, there are $2^2 = 4$ possible distinct valuations. The problem states that these four valuations are equally likely, each having a probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe semantics of the logical connectives are truth-functional.\nThe material conditional, $P \\to Q$, is true (evaluates to $1$) in all cases except when the antecedent $P$ is true and the consequent $Q$ is false. Its truth table is:\n- If $v(P)=1$ and $v(Q)=1$, then $v(P \\to Q)=1$.\n- If $v(P)=1$ and $v(Q)=0$, then $v(P \\to Q)=0$.\n- If $v(P)=0$ and $v(Q)=1$, then $v(P \\to Q)=1$.\n- If $v(P)=0$ and $v(Q)=0$, then $v(P \\to Q)=1$.\n\nAn argument is invalid if and only if there is at least one valuation for which the conjunction of all its premises is true, but its conclusion is false. In this case, we are looking for valuations $v$ that satisfy the following three conditions simultaneously:\n1. The first premise is true: $v(P \\to Q) = 1$.\n2. The second premise is true: $v(Q) = 1$.\n3. The conclusion is false: $v(P) = 0$.\n\nWe can systematically examine all four possible valuations for the variables $P$ and $Q$ to find which ones, if any, satisfy these conditions. We can organize this analysis in a truth table.\n\nLet's denote the set of all valuations as $\\mathcal{V}$. The four valuations are:\n1. $v_1$, where $v_1(P)=1$ and $v_1(Q)=1$.\n2. $v_2$, where $v_2(P)=1$ and $v_2(Q)=0$.\n3. $v_3$, where $v_3(P)=0$ and $v_3(Q)=1$.\n4. $v_4$, where $v_4(P)=0$ and $v_4(Q)=0$.\n\nNow, for each valuation, we evaluate the premises and the conclusion.\n\nCase 1: Valuation $v_1$ ($v(P)=1, v(Q)=1$)\n- Premise 1: $v_1(P \\to Q)$. Since $v_1(P)=1$ and $v_1(Q)=1$, $v_1(P \\to Q)=1$.\n- Premise 2: $v_1(Q) = 1$.\n- Conclusion: $v_1(P) = 1$.\nIn this case, both premises are true, and the conclusion is also true. This is not a counterexample.\n\nCase 2: Valuation $v_2$ ($v(P)=1, v(Q)=0$)\n- Premise 1: $v_2(P \\to Q)$. Since $v_2(P)=1$ and $v_2(Q)=0$, $v_2(P \\to Q)=0$.\n- Premise 2: $v_2(Q) = 0$.\nIn this case, both premises are false. Since not all premises are true, this is not a counterexample.\n\nCase 3: Valuation $v_3$ ($v(P)=0, v(Q)=1$)\n- Premise 1: $v_3(P \\to Q)$. Since $v_3(P)=0$ and $v_3(Q)=1$, $v_3(P \\to Q)=1$.\n- Premise 2: $v_3(Q) = 1$.\n- Conclusion: $v_3(P) = 0$.\nIn this case, both premises are true ($v_3(P \\to Q) = 1$ and $v_3(Q) = 1$), but the conclusion is false ($v_3(P) = 0$). This valuation is a counterexample and demonstrates the invalidity of the argument form \"affirming the consequent\". This is the explicit valuation witnessing the invalidity, as requested by the problem.\n\nCase 4: Valuation $v_4$ ($v(P)=0, v(Q)=0$)\n- Premise 1: $v_4(P \\to Q)$. Since $v_4(P)=0$ and $v_4(Q)=0$, $v_4(P \\to Q)=1$.\n- Premise 2: $v_4(Q) = 0$.\nIn this case, the first premise is true, but the second premise is false. Since not all premises are true, this is not a counterexample.\n\nSummary of the analysis:\n| Valuation | $v(P)$ | $v(Q)$ | $v(P \\to Q)$ | $v(Q)$ | Both Premises True? | $v(P)$ | Conclusion False? | Counterexample? |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| $v_1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | Yes | $1$ | No | No |\n| $v_2$ | $1$ | $0$ | $0$ | $0$ | No | $1$ | No | No |\n| $v_3$ | $0$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | Yes | $0$ | Yes | **Yes** |\n| $v_4$ | $0$ | $0$ | $1$ | $0$ | No | $0$ | Yes | No |\n\nOut of the $4$ total possible valuations, exactly $1$ of them—the valuation $v_3$ where $v(P)=0$ and $v(Q)=1$—results in the premises being true while the conclusion is false.\nLet $N_{total}$ be the total number of valuations, so $N_{total} = 4$.\nLet $N_{counterexample}$ be the number of valuations that are counterexamples, so $N_{counterexample} = 1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction of all valuations for which the premises are true and the conclusion is false. Given the uniform distribution assumption, this fraction is the ratio of the number of counterexample valuations to the total number of valuations.\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{N_{counterexample}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nThis fraction is already in its reduced form.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$$", "id": "3046536"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how the precise definition of material implication can invalidate a seemingly plausible argument, we now explore its creative potential.

This definition entails the well-known paradoxical-seeming features of material implication, such as that any conditional with a false antecedent is true and any conditional with a true consequent is true.\n\nStarting only from this truth-functional definition and standard equivalences of classical logic, consider the four binary connectives obtained by optionally negating each argument of the material conditional:\n- $P \\to Q$,\n- $\\lnot P \\to Q$,\n- $P \\to \\lnot Q$,\n- $\\lnot P \\to \\lnot Q$.\n\nUsing only the given definition and classical equivalences, determine how many pairwise distinct propositional connectives (that is, distinct truth functions of the two variables $P$ and $Q$) occur among these four.

The analysis will proceed by first simplifying each formula into an equivalent form using only the connectives $\\lnot$ (negation), $\\lor$ (disjunction), and $\\land$ (conjunction), and then comparing their truth tables.\n\nThe fundamental tool for this analysis is the standard truth-functional definition of the material conditional in classical logic. For any two propositions $A$ and $B$, the conditional $A \\to B$ is logically equivalent to the disjunction $\\lnot A \\lor B$.\n$$A \\to B \\equiv \\lnot A \\lor B$$\nWe will apply this equivalence to each of the four given formulas.\n\n1.  **Formula 1: $P \\to Q$**\n    Applying the equivalence directly with $A=P$ and $B=Q$, we get:\n    $$P \\to Q \\equiv \\lnot P \\lor Q$$\n\n2.  **Formula 2: $\\lnot P \\to Q$**\n    Here, the antecedent is $A = \\lnot P$ and the consequent is $B = Q$.

The secondary task is to interpret this result in light of the concept of assertability of an indicative conditional, contrasting it with the conditional probability $\\Pr(Q \\mid P)$.\n\nFirst, we establish the logical structure of the material implication $P \\to Q$. The problem states that $P \\to Q$ is true in all cases except when $P$ is true and $Q$ is false. This condition, where $P$ is true and $Q$ is false, can be represented by the logical conjunction $P \\land \\neg Q$. The material implication $P \\to Q$ is thus logically equivalent to the negation of this case, namely $\\neg(P \\land \\neg Q)$.\n\nIn the context of probability theory, propositions are treated as events in a sample space. The probability of a proposition being true is the measure of the corresponding event set. Logical connectives translate to set-theoretic operations: conjunction ($\\land$) corresponds to intersection ($\\cap$), negation ($\\neg$) corresponds to the complement (e.g., $P^c$), and disjunction ($\\lor$) corresponds to union ($\\cup$).\n\nThe event corresponding to $P \\to Q$ is the complement of the event corresponding to $P \\land \\neg Q$. Let us denote the events corresponding to the propositions $P$ and $Q$ by the same symbols. The event for $P \\land \\neg Q$ is $P \\cap Q^c$. Therefore, the probability of the material implication is given by:\n$$\n\\Pr(P \\to Q) = \\Pr(\\neg(P \\land \\neg Q)) = 1 - \\Pr(P \\cap Q^c)\n$$\nWe are given that propositions $P$ and $Q$ are probabilistically independent. A key property of independence is that if two events are independent, then their complements are also independent of each other and of the original events. Specifically, if $P$ and $Q$ are independent, then $P$ and $Q^c$ are also independent.\n\nThe probability of the intersection of two independent events is the product of their individual probabilities. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\Pr(P \\cap Q^c) = \\Pr(P) \\times \\Pr(Q^c)\n$$\nWe are given $\\Pr(P) = 0.01$ and $\\Pr(Q) = 0.5$. The probability of the complement of $Q$ is:\n$$\n\\Pr(Q^c) = 1 - \\Pr(Q) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n$$\nNow, we can compute $\\Pr(P \\cap Q^c)$:\n$$\n\\Pr(P \\cap Q^c) = 0.01 \\times 0.5 = 0.005\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this value back into the expression for $\\Pr(P \\to Q)$:\n$$\n\\Pr(P \\to Q) = 1 - \\Pr(P \\cap Q^c) = 1 - 0.005 = 0.995\n$$\nAlternatively, one can use the logical equivalence $P \\to Q \\equiv \\neg P \\lor Q$. The corresponding probability is $\\Pr(P^c \\cup Q)$. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n$$\n\\Pr(P^c \\cup Q) = \\Pr(P^c) + \\Pr(Q) - \\Pr(P^c \\cap Q)\n$$\nGiven independence of $P$ and $Q$, $P^c$ and $Q$ are also independent.\n$$\n\\Pr(P^c) = 1 - \\Pr(P) = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99\n$$\n$$\n\\Pr(P^c \\cap Q) = \\Pr(P^c) \\times \\Pr(Q) = 0.99 \\times 0.5 = 0.495\n$$\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\n\\Pr(P^c \\cup Q) = 0.99 + 0.5 - 0.495 = 1.49 - 0.495 = 0.995\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same result, $\\Pr(P \\to Q) = 0.995$.\n\nFor the interpretive part, we are asked to contrast this with the conditional probability $\\Pr(Q \\mid P)$. The formula for conditional probability is:\n$$\n\\Pr(Q \\mid P) = \\frac{\\Pr(Q \\cap P)}{\\Pr(P)}\n$$\nDue to the independence of $P$ and $Q$, $\\Pr(Q \\cap P) = \\Pr(Q) \\times \\Pr(P)$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\Pr(Q \\mid P) = \\frac{\\Pr(Q) \\times \\Pr(P)}{\\Pr(P)} = \\Pr(Q)\n$$\nGiven $\\Pr(Q) = 0.5$, we have:\n$$\n\\Pr(Q \\mid P) = 0.5\n$$\nThe assertability of an indicative conditional, such as \"If it rains ($P$), the street will be wet ($Q$)\", is most naturally understood as the probability that the consequent ($Q$) is true, given that the antecedent ($P$) is true. This corresponds precisely to the conditional probability $\\Pr(Q \\mid P)$. In our case, this value is $0.5$, suggesting a moderate degree of belief; one is only $50\\%$ confident that $Q$ will occur given that $P$ has occurred.\n\nIn stark contrast, the probability of the material implication, $\\Pr(P \\to Q)$, is $0.995$, a value extremely close to $1$. This high probability does not arise from a strong connection between $P$ and $Q$ (indeed, they are independent). Rather, it is overwhelmingly influenced by the low probability of the antecedent, $\\Pr(P)=0.01$. Since the material implication $P \\to Q$ is true whenever $P$ is false (an event with probability $\\Pr(P^c) = 0.99$), the probability $\\Pr(P \\to Q)$ is guaranteed to be at least $0.99$.\n\nThis discrepancy is a classic illustration of the \"paradoxes of material implication\" when translated into a probabilistic framework. It demonstrates that equating the probability of an indicative conditional with the probability of the corresponding material implication leads to counter-intuitive results. The high value of $\\Pr(P \\to Q)$ reflects the logical truth that a conditional with a false antecedent is true, regardless of the consequent, rather than reflecting a meaningful, assertable connection between the antecedent and the consequent. This has led many logicians and philosophers to favor Adams's Thesis, which posits that the probability of an indicative conditional is best measured by the conditional probability, i.e., $\\Pr(\\text{If } P \\text{ then } Q) = \\Pr(Q \\mid P)$, not $\\Pr(P \\to Q)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.995}\n$$", "id": "3046527"}]}
