For $A \\cup B$ to be the LUB of $A$ and $B$, it must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  It must be an upper bound of $A$ and $B$.\n2.  It must be the least of all upper bounds.\n\nCondition 1: An upper bound $C$ of $A$ and $B$ must satisfy $A \\subseteq C$ and $B \\subseteq C$.\nBy the definition of set union, for any element $x \\in A$, it is true that $x \\in A \\cup B$. Thus, $A \\subseteq A \\cup B$. Similarly, for any element $y \\in B$, it is true that $y \\in A \\cup B$. Thus, $B \\subseteq A \\cup B$.\nTherefore, $A \\cup B$ is an upper bound for $A$ and $B$.\n\nCondition 2: Let $C$ be any arbitrary upper bound of $A$ and $B$, meaning $A \\subseteq C$ and $B \\subseteq C$. We must show that $A \\cup B \\subseteq C$ to prove that $A \\cup B$ is the least upper bound.\nLet $x$ be an arbitrary element of $A \\cup B$. By the elementwise definition of union, $x \\in A$ or $x \\in B$.\n- If $x \\in A$, then since $A \\subseteq C$, we must have $x \\in C$.\n- If $x \\in B$, then since $B \\subseteq C$, we must have $x \\in C$.\nIn either case, if $x \\in A \\cup B$, then $x \\in C$. This implies that $A \\cup B \\subseteq C$.\nSince $A \\cup B$ is an upper bound and is a subset of any other upper bound, it is the least upper bound.\n\nVisually, in the Hasse diagram of $L$, an upward path from a set $X$ corresponds to adding elements. The join of $A$ and $B$ is the lowest vertex that can be reached by an upward path from both $A$ and $B$. This vertex corresponds to the smallest set containing both $A$ and $B$, which is precisely their union $A \\cup B$.\n\n**Justification for Meet as Intersection ($A \\land B = A \\cap B$)**\n\nThe meet of $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \\land B$, is defined as their greatest lower bound (GLB). For $A \\cap B$ to be the GLB of $A$ and $B$, it must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  It must be a lower bound of $A$ and $B$.\n2.  It must be the greatest of all lower bounds.\n\nCondition 1: A lower bound $D$ of $A$ and $B$ must satisfy $D \\subseteq A$ and $D \\subseteq B$.\nBy the definition of set intersection, any element $x \\in A \\cap B$ must be in both $A$ and $B$. Therefore, $A \\cap B \\subseteq A$ and $A \\cap B \\subseteq B$.\nThus, $A \\cap B$ is a lower bound for $A$ and $B$.\n\nCondition 2: Let $D$ be any arbitrary lower bound of $A$ and $B$, meaning $D \\subseteq A$ and $D \\subseteq B$. We must show that $D \\subseteq A \\cap B$ to prove that $A \\cap B$ is the greatest lower bound.\nLet $x$ be an arbitrary element of $D$.\nSince $D \\subseteq A$, we have $x \\in A$.\nSince $D \\subseteq B$, we have $x \\in B$.\nBecause $x \\in A$ and $x \\in B$, by the elementwise definition of intersection, it follows that $x \\in A \\cap B$.\nSince any element of $D$ is also an element of $A \\cap B$, we have $D \\subseteq A \\cap B$.\nSince $A \\cap B$ is a lower bound and any other lower bound is a subset of it, $A \\cap B$ is the greatest lower bound.\n\nVisually, in the Hasse diagram, the meet of $A$ and $B$ is the highest vertex from which one can reach both $A$ and $B$ via upward paths. This corresponds to the largest set contained within both $A$ and $B$, which is their intersection $A \\cap B$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of De Morgan's Laws**\n\nDe Morgan's laws are proved by showing that the sets on each side of the equality are subsets of each other, using only the provided elementwise definitions. The universe is $U$. For any set $A \\subseteq U$, its complement is $A^{c} = U \\setminus A$. An element $x \\in A^{c}$ if and only if $x \\notin A$.\n\n**Derivation of $(A \\cup B)^{c} = A^{c} \\cap B^{c}$**\n\nFirst, we show $(A \\cup B)^{c} \\subseteq A^{c} \\cap B^{c}$.\nLet $x \\in (A \\cup B)^{c}$. By definition of complement, $x \\notin A \\cup B$.\nThis means it is not true that ($x \\in A$ or $x \\in B$).\nFrom logic, this is equivalent to ($x \\notin A$) and ($x \\notin B$).\nBy definition of complement, $x \\notin A$ is equivalent to $x \\in A^{c}$, and $x \\notin B$ is equivalent to $x \\in B^{c}$.\nSo, we have ($x \\in A^{c}$) and ($x \\in B^{c}$).\nBy the elementwise definition of intersection, this implies $x \\in A^{c} \\cap B^{c}$.\nThus, any element of $(A \\cup B)^{c}$ is also an element of $A^{c} \\cap B^{c}$, so $(A \\cup B)^{c} \\subseteq A^{c} \\cap B^{c}$.\n\nNext, we show $A^{c} \\cap B^{c} \\subseteq (A \\cup B)^{c}$.\nLet $x \\in A^{c} \\cap B^{c}$. By the elementwise definition of intersection, ($x \\in A^{c}$) and ($x \\in B^{c}$).\nBy definition of complement, this means ($x \\notin A$) and ($x \\notin B$).\nLogically, this is equivalent to stating that it is not true that ($x \\in A$ or $x \\in B$).\nBy the elementwise definition of union, this means $x \\notin A \\cup B$.\nBy definition of complement, this implies $x \\in (A \\cup B)^{c}$.\nThus, any element of $A^{c} \\cap B^{c}$ is also an element of $(A \\cup B)^{c}$, so $A^{c} \\cap B^{c} \\subseteq (A \\cup B)^{c}$.\n\nSince both sets are subsets of each other, they are equal: $(A \\cup B)^{c} = A^{c} \\cap B^{c}$.\n\n**Derivation of $(A \\cap B)^{c} = A^{c} \\cup B^{c}$**\n\nFirst, we show $(A \\cap B)^{c} \\subseteq A^{c} \\cup B^{c}$.\nLet $x \\in (A \\cap B)^{c}$. By definition of complement, $x \\notin A \\cap B$.\nThis means it is not true that ($x \\in A$ and $x \\in B$).\nFrom logic, this is equivalent to ($x \\notin A$) or ($x \\notin B$).\nBy definition of complement, this is equivalent to ($x \\in A^{c}$) or ($x \\in B^{c}$).\nBy the elementwise definition of union, this implies $x \\in A^{c} \\cup B^{c}$.\nThus, $(A \\cap B)^{c} \\subseteq A^{c} \\cup B^{c}$.\n\nNext, we show $A^{c} \\cup B^{c} \\subseteq (A \\cap B)^{c}$.\nLet $x \\in A^{c} \\cup B^{c}$. By the elementwise definition of union, ($x \\in A^{c}$) or ($x \\in B^{c}$).\nBy definition of complement, this means ($x \\notin A$) or ($x \\notin B$).\nLogically, this is equivalent to stating that it is not true that ($x \\in A$ and $x \\in B$).\nBy the elementwise definition of intersection, this means $x \\notin A \\cap B$.\nBy definition of complement, this implies $x \\in (A \\cap B)^{c}$.\nThus, $A^{c} \\cup B^{c} \\subseteq (A \\cap B)^{c}$.\n\nSince both sets are subsets of each other, they are equal: $(A \\cap B)^{c} = A^{c} \\cup B^{c}$.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of $N$**\n\nThe problem asks for $N$, the number of ordered pairs $(A, B) \\in L \\times L$ for which both De Morgan's laws hold simultaneously. The two laws are:\n1. $(A \\cup B)^{c} = A^{c} \\cap B^{c}$\n2. $(A \\cap B)^{c} = A^{c} \\cup B^{c}$\n\nAs rigorously demonstrated in Part 2, these two equalities are theorems of set theory. They are identities that hold true for *any* and *all* sets $A$ and $B$ within a given universe $U$. The proofs did not impose any special conditions on $A$ or $B$.\n\nTherefore, the condition \"for which both of the equalities above hold simultaneously\" is satisfied by every single ordered pair $(A, B)$ of subsets of $U$. The problem reduces to counting the total number of such pairs.\n\nThe set $L$ is the power set of $U = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\nThe cardinality of the universe is $|U| = 3$.\nThe cardinality of the power set $L = \\mathcal{P}(U)$ is given by $2^{|U|}$.\nSo, $|L| = 2^{3} = 8$.\n\nWe are looking for the number of ordered pairs $(A, B)$ where $A \\in L$ and $B \\in L$. This is the cardinality of the Cartesian product $L \\times L$.\nThe number of such pairs is $N = |L \\times L| = |L| \\times |L| = |L|^{2}$.\nSubstituting the value of $|L|$:\n$N = 8^{2} = 64$.\n\nThus, there are $64$ ordered pairs of subsets of $U$ for which De Morgan's laws hold, simply because these laws are universally true for all such pairs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{64}$$", "id": "3039970"}, {"introduction": "The previous practices have shown De Morgan's laws holding in classical logic and set theory, both of which are examples of distributive lattices (specifically, Boolean algebras).

We are tasked with verifying that this structure is a complemented lattice, demonstrating its non-distributivity, and checking a specific instance of a De Morgan identity.\n\nFirst, we address Task 1: Verify from first principles that $(L, \\land, \\lor, 0, 1, \\neg)$ is a complemented lattice.\nA complemented lattice is a bounded lattice (with a least element $0$ and a greatest element $1$) where for every element $x$, there exists a complement $y$ such that $x \\land y = 0$ and $x \\lor y = 1$. The problem defines a specific unary operation $\\neg x$ which selects a complement for each $x$. We must verify that for every $x \\in L$, $\\neg x$ is indeed a complement of $x$. This requires checking the identities $x \\land \\neg x = 0$ and $x \\lor \\neg x = 1$ for all five elements of $L$. The foundational definitions of a lattice imply that the meet and join operations are commutative, i.e., $x \\land y = y \\land x$ and $x \\lor y = y \\lor x$.\n\n-   For $x=0$: The designated complement is $\\neg 0 = 1$.

It is noteworthy that for element $c$, $b$ is also a valid complement since $c \\land b = 0$ and $c \\lor b = 1$. The non-uniqueness of complements is characteristic of non-distributive lattices.\n\nSecond, we address Task 2: Demonstrate that $L$ is not distributive.\nA lattice is distributive if the law $x \\land (y \\lor z) = (x \\land y) \\lor (x \\land z)$ holds for all $x, y, z \\in L$. To show $L$ is not distributive, we need to find a single counterexample. Let us choose $x=a$, $y=b$, and $z=c$.\n\nWe compute the left-hand side (LHS) of the distributive law:\n$x \\land (y \\lor z) = a \\land (b \\lor c)$.\nFrom the problem's givens, $b \\lor c = 1$.\nTherefore, LHS $= a \\land 1 = a$.\n\nNext, we compute the right-hand side (RHS) of the distributive law:\n$(x \\land y) \\lor (x \\land z) = (a \\land b) \\lor (a \\land c)$.\nFrom the problem's givens, $a \\land b = 0$ and $a \\land c = 0$.\nTherefore, RHS $= 0 \\lor 0 = 0$.\n\nComparing the two sides, we have LHS $= a$ and RHS $= 0$. Since $a \\neq 0$, it follows that $a \\land (b \\lor c) \\neq (a \\land b) \\lor (a \\land c)$. The distributive law fails, and thus the lattice $L$ is not distributive.\n\nThird, we address Task 3: Compute explicitly $\\neg(b \\land c)$ and $\\neg b \\lor \\neg c$ and determine if the identity $\\neg(x \\land y) = \\neg x \\lor \\neg y$ holds for $x=b$ and $y=c$.\n\nWe first compute the expression $\\neg(b \\land c)$.\n1.  Evaluate the term inside the parentheses: $b \\land c$. From the problem definition, $b \\land c = 0$.\n2.  Apply the unary operation $\\neg$ to this result: $\\neg(0)$. From the problem definition, $\\neg 0 = 1$.\nSo, we find that $\\neg(b \\land c) = 1$.\n\nNext, we compute the expression $\\neg b \\lor \\neg c$.\n1.  Evaluate the individual terms: $\\neg b$ and $\\neg c$. From the problem definition, $\\neg b = a$ and $\\neg c = a$.\n2.  Compute the join of these results: $a \\lor a$. The idempotent law, $x \\lor x = x$, is a fundamental property of lattices and is given in the problem statement. Therefore, $a \\lor a = a$.\nSo, we find that $\\neg b \\lor \\neg c = a$.\n\nComparing the two results, we have $\\neg(b \\land c) = 1$ and $\\neg b \\lor \\neg c = a$. Since $a$ and $1$ are distinct elements of the lattice ($a < 1$), we conclude that $\\neg(b \\land c) \\neq \\neg b \\lor \\neg c$. The De Morgan identity fails for this specific choice of complementation function $\\neg$ and elements $b, c$. This demonstrates that a complemented lattice is not necessarily a De Morgan algebra, a property typically associated with Boolean algebras, which are distributive.\n\nThe final answer requires the ordered pair $(\\neg(b \\land c), \\neg b \\lor \\neg c)$.
