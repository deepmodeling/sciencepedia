To show the extended system is not sound, we need to show it can prove a formula that is not a tautology. The proposed method is to start with a known theorem (an axiom instance), apply the new rule CI, and show the resulting formula is not a tautology by finding a falsifying valuation. For a formula of the form $\\Theta \\rightarrow \\Lambda$ to be false, we need a valuation where $\\Theta$ is true and $\\Lambda$ is false.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A**\n1.  **Requirement 1 (Start with an axiom)**: The scenario starts with an instance of axiom $A1$: $\\varphi \\rightarrow (\\psi \\rightarrow \\varphi)$. By substituting $\\varphi$ with $p$ and $\\psi$ with $q$, we get the formula $p \\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow p)$. This is a valid axiom instance, and therefore a theorem of $\\mathsf{H}$. This requirement is met. Here, $\\alpha$ is $p$ and $\\beta$ is $(q \\rightarrow p)$.\n2.  **Requirement 2 (Apply CI)**: The rule CI, when applied to $\\alpha \\rightarrow \\beta$, yields $\\beta \\rightarrow \\alpha$. In this case, it yields $(q \\rightarrow p) \\rightarrow p$. This requirement is met.\n3.  **Requirement 3 (Falsifying valuation)**: The option proposes the valuation $v(p)=0$ and $v(q)=0$. Let's evaluate the inferred formula $(q \\rightarrow p) \\rightarrow p$ under this valuation.\n    - First, evaluate the antecedent: $v(q \\rightarrow p) = v(0 \\rightarrow 0) = 1$.\n    - Then, evaluate the full formula: $v((q \\rightarrow p) \\rightarrow p) = v(1 \\rightarrow 0) = 0$.\n    The valuation indeed falsifies the inferred formula. This requirement is met.\n\nSince all three requirements are satisfied, this option presents a correct counterexample. The formula $(q \\rightarrow p) \\rightarrow p$ is known as Peirce's Law, which is not provable in intuitionistic logic but is a tautology in classical logic. However, the rule CI is applied to $p \\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow p)$, resulting in $(q \\rightarrow p) \\rightarrow p$. The starting point is correct. The application of the rule is correct. The valuation correctly shows the result is not a tautology. Wait, let me re-check Peirce's Law. Peirce's law is $((p \\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow p) \\rightarrow p$. The formula here is $(q \\rightarrow p) \\rightarrow p$. These are syntactically different. Let me re-evaluate the falsification. The calculation $v((q \\rightarrow p) \\rightarrow p) = v(1 \\rightarrow 0) = 0$ for $v(p)=0, v(q)=0$ is correct. The formula is not a tautology. All conditions are met.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B**\n1.  **Requirement 1 (Start with an axiom)**: The scenario starts with an instance of $A2$: $(\\varphi \\rightarrow (\\psi \\rightarrow \\chi)) \\rightarrow ((\\varphi \\rightarrow \\psi) \\rightarrow (\\varphi \\rightarrow \\chi))$. The specified instance is $(p \\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow r)) \\rightarrow ((p \\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow (p \\rightarrow r))$. This is a valid axiom instance. Requirement met. Here, $\\alpha = (p \\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow r))$ and $\\beta = ((p \\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow (p \\rightarrow r))$.\n2.  **Requirement 2 (Apply CI)**: The rule CI infers $\\beta \\rightarrow \\alpha$, which is $((p \\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow (p \\rightarrow r)) \\rightarrow (p \\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow r))$. Requirement met.\n3.  **Requirement 3 (Falsifying valuation)**: The option proposes the valuation $v(p)=1$, $v(q)=1$, $v(r)=0$ and claims the inferred formula is false. Let's evaluate.\n    - Antecedent of the inferred formula: $((p \\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow (p \\rightarrow r))$.\n      - $v(p \\rightarrow q) = v(1 \\rightarrow 1) = 1$.\n      - $v(p \\rightarrow r) = v(1 \\rightarrow 0) = 0$.\n      - $v((p \\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow (p \\rightarrow r)) = v(1 \\rightarrow 0) = 0$.\n    - Consequent of the inferred formula: $(p \\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow r))$.\n      - $v(q \\rightarrow r) = v(1 \\rightarrow 0) = 0$.\n      - $v(p \\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow r)) = v(1 \\rightarrow 0) = 0$.\n    - Full inferred formula: $v(((p \\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow (p \\rightarrow r)) \\rightarrow (p \\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow r))) = v(0 \\rightarrow 0) = 1$.\n    The proposed valuation makes the inferred formula true, not false. The claim in the option is incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C**\n1.  **Requirement 1 (Start with an axiom)**: The scenario starts with the formula $p \\rightarrow q$. This is not an instance of any of the axiom schemata $A1, A2, A3$. Nor is it a theorem of $\\mathsf{H}$ (it is not a tautology). The rule CI, like any rule of inference in a proof system, must be applied to a formula that has already been proven (i.e., a theorem). Axioms are theorems by definition. Since $p \\rightarrow q$ is not a theorem, CI cannot be applied to it. This requirement is violated.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D**\n1.  **Requirement 1 (Start with an axiom)**: The scenario starts with an instance of $A3$: $(\\lnot \\psi \\rightarrow \\lnot \\varphi) \\rightarrow (\\varphi \\rightarrow \\psi)$. The specified instance is $(\\lnot q \\rightarrow \\lnot p) \\rightarrow (p \\rightarrow q)$. This is a valid axiom instance. Requirement met. Here, $\\alpha = (\\lnot q \\rightarrow \\lnot p)$ and $\\beta = (p \\rightarrow q)$.\n2.  **Requirement 2 (Apply CI)**: The rule CI infers $\\beta \\rightarrow \\alpha$, which is $(p \\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow (\\lnot q \\rightarrow \\lnot p)$. Requirement met.\n3.  **Requirement 3 (Falsifying valuation)**: The option proposes the valuation $v(p)=1, v(q)=0$ and claims the inferred formula is false. Let's evaluate.\n    - Antecedent of the inferred formula: $v(p \\rightarrow q) = v(1 \\rightarrow 0) = 0$.\n    - Since the antecedent of the main implication is false, the entire formula is true. $v((p \\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow (\\lnot q \\rightarrow \\lnot p)) = v(0 \\rightarrow \\dots) = 1$.\n    (For completeness: $v(\\lnot q) = v(\\lnot 0) = 1$, $v(\\lnot p) = v(\\lnot 1) = 0$, so $v(\\lnot q \\rightarrow \\lnot p) = v(1 \\rightarrow 0) = 0$. The overall value is $v(0 \\rightarrow 0) = 1$.)\n    The valuation makes the formula true, not false. The claim is incorrect. In fact, the inferred formula $(p \\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow (\\lnot q \\rightarrow \\lnot p)$ is a form of the law of contraposition and is a classical tautology, so no valuation can falsify it.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option E**\n1.  **Requirement 1 (Start with an axiom)**: The scenario starts with an instance of $A1$: $\\varphi \\rightarrow (\\psi \\rightarrow \\varphi)$. The instantiation is $\\varphi = (p \\rightarrow p)$ and $\\psi = q$, yielding $(p \\rightarrow p) \\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow (p \\rightarrow p))$. This is a valid axiom instance. Requirement met. Here, $\\alpha = (p \\rightarrow p)$ and $\\beta = (q \\rightarrow (p \\rightarrow p))$.\n2.  **Requirement 2 (Apply CI)**: The rule CI infers $\\beta \\rightarrow \\alpha$, which is $(q \\rightarrow (p \\rightarrow p)) \\rightarrow (p \\rightarrow p)$. Requirement met.\n3.  **Requirement 3 (Falsifying valuation)**: The option proposes the valuation $v(p)=0, v(q)=0$ and claims the inferred formula is false. Let's evaluate.\n    - The subformula $(p \\rightarrow p)$ is a tautology; its value is always $1$ regardless of the valuation of $p$. Let's denote it by $T$. So $v(p \\rightarrow p)=1$.\n    - The inferred formula is $(q \\rightarrow T) \\rightarrow T$.\n    - The antecedent $(q \\rightarrow T)$ is also a tautology. Its consequent $T$ is always true, so the implication is always true. $v(q \\rightarrow (p \\rightarrow p)) = 1$ for any valuation.\n    - The full formula becomes $T \\rightarrow T$, which evaluates to $v(1 \\rightarrow 1) = 1$.\n    The inferred formula is a tautology and cannot be falsified by any valuation. The claim that the specific valuation $v(p)=0, v(q)=0$ yields $0$ is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nConclusion: Only option A successfully provides a correct counterexample scenario that satisfies all three conditions stipulated in the problem statement.

The first part is to explain, using semantic definitions, why a tableau closure based on a flawed existential instantiation is spurious. The second part is to determine the minimum cardinality of a domain for a structure that satisfies $\\Gamma$.\n\nPart 1: Analysis of the Spurious Tableau Closure\n\nThe soundness of a proof system, such as the analytic tableau method, is its most critical property. It guarantees that the system only proves true statements. For tableau, soundness means that if a tableau for a set of formulas $\\Gamma$ closes, then $\\Gamma$ is semantically unsatisfiable. This property relies on each tableau rule being satisfiability-preserving: if a set of formulas on a branch is satisfiable, then the set of formulas on the extended branch (or branches) after applying a rule is also satisfiable.\n\nThe standard existential instantiation rule states that if a branch contains a formula of the form $\\exists x\\,\\varphi(x)$, one may add the formula $\\varphi(c)$ to the branch, where $c$ is a parameter symbol that is new to the branch. The violation described in the problem is to ignore this \"newness\" or \"freshness\" requirement.\n\nLet us analyze this violation in the context of the set $\\Gamma=\\{\\exists x\\,P(x),\\ \\exists x\\,\\neg P(x)\\}$.\nThe semantic definition of satisfaction for an existential formula in a structure $\\mathcal{M} = (D, I)$, where $D$ is the domain and $I$ is the interpretation function, is as follows:\n$\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists x\\,\\varphi(x)$ if and only if there exists at least one element $d \\in D$ such that the formula $\\varphi(x)$ is satisfied in $\\mathcal{M}$ under a variable assignment that maps $x$ to $d$. We denote this as $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\varphi(d)$.\n\nApplying this to the formulas in $\\Gamma$:\n1.  For a structure $\\mathcal{M}$ to satisfy $\\exists x\\,P(x)$, written $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists x\\,P(x)$, there must exist some element, let's call it $d_1$, in the domain $D$ such that $d_1$ is in the interpretation of $P$. That is, $d_1 \\in P^{\\mathcal{M}}$.\n2.  For $\\mathcal{M}$ to satisfy $\\exists x\\,\\neg P(x)$, written $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists x\\,\\neg P(x)$, there must exist some element, let's call it $d_2$, in the domain $D$ such that $d_2$ is not in the interpretation of $P$. That is, $d_2 \\notin P^{\\mathcal{M}}$.\n\nThe crucial point is that the semantic definitions do not impose any relationship between $d_1$ and $d_2$. In particular, they do not require that $d_1 = d_2$. The set $\\Gamma$ is satisfiable if we can find a domain $D$ and an interpretation $P^{\\mathcal{M}}$ such that there is at least one element in $P^{\\mathcal{M}}$ and at least one element not in $P^{\\mathcal{M}}$.\n\nThe careless tableau construction instantiates both $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ and $\\exists x\\,\\neg P(x)$ using the same, non-fresh parameter $a$. This adds $P(a)$ and $\\neg P(a)$ to the same branch. A branch containing a formula and its negation, $P(a)$ and $\\neg P(a)$, is contradictory and must be closed.\nThis closure is spurious because the rule application was unsound. By using the same parameter $a$ for both instantiations, the tableau is no longer searching for any model of $\\Gamma$. Instead, it is searching for a model of a much stronger, implicitly derived formula: $\\exists x\\,(P(x) \\land \\neg P(x))$. This formula asserts the existence of a single element that both has and does not have the property $P$. Such a formula is a logical falsehood and is unsatisfiable in any FOL structure. The flawed tableau rule transforms the satisfiable set $\\Gamma$ into an unsatisfiable statement. The closure of the tableau correctly indicates that $\\exists x\\,(P(x) \\land \\neg P(x))$ is unsatisfiable, but it incorrectly attributes this unsatisfiability to the original set $\\Gamma$. The mistake lies in the inferential step, which does not preserve satisfiability and is therefore unsound.\n\nPart 2: Minimum Cardinality of a Satisfying Model\n\nWe seek the minimum possible cardinality, $n = |D|$, of the domain $D$ of a structure $\\mathcal{M}=(D, P^{\\mathcal{M}})$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\Gamma$.\nAs established, for $\\mathcal{M}$ to be a model of $\\Gamma$, two conditions must be met:\n1.  $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ is true in $\\mathcal{M}$, which means $P^{\\mathcal{M}} \\neq \\emptyset$.\n2.  $\\exists x\\,\\neg P(x)$ is true in $\\mathcal{M}$, which means $P^{\\mathcal{M}} \\neq D$, or equivalently, $D \\setminus P^{\\mathcal{M}} \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nLet's test possible values for $n$, starting from the smallest allowed cardinality for a domain in standard FOL, which is $1$.\n\nCase $n=1$: Let the domain be $D = \\{d_0\\}$. The interpretation of $P$, $P^{\\mathcal{M}}$, must be a subset of $D$. There are two possibilities for $P^{\\mathcal{M}}$:\n-   If we set $P^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\emptyset$, then the formula $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ is false, because there is no element in $D$ that is a member of $P^{\\mathcal{M}}$. So, this structure is not a model of $\\Gamma$.\n-   If we set $P^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\{d_0\\}$, then $P^{\\mathcal{M}} = D$. The formula $\\exists x\\,\\neg P(x)$ is false, because there is no element in $D$ that is not a member of $P^{\\mathcal{M}}$. So, this structure is not a model of $\\Gamma$.\nIn either case, it is impossible to satisfy both formulas in $\\Gamma$ with a domain of cardinality $1$. Therefore, the minimum cardinality must be $n > 1$.\n\nCase $n=2$: Let the domain be $D = \\{d_1, d_2\\}$. We need to find an interpretation $P^{\\mathcal{M}} \\subseteq D$ that satisfies both conditions.\nLet's define $P^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\{d_1\\}$. Now we check if this structure $\\mathcal{M}=(D, P^{\\mathcal{M}})$ is a model for $\\Gamma$:\n-   Check $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists x\\,P(x)$: The element $d_1$ exists in $D$ and $d_1 \\in P^{\\mathcal{M}}$. Thus, the formula is satisfied.\n-   Check $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists x\\,\\neg P(x)$: The element $d_2$ exists in $D$ and $d_2 \\notin P^{\\mathcal{M}}$. Thus, the formula is satisfied.\nSince both formulas in $\\Gamma$ are satisfied, we have successfully constructed a model with a domain of cardinality $2$.\n\nSince a model of cardinality $1$ is impossible ($n>1$) and a model of cardinality $2$ exists ($n \\le 2$), the minimum possible cardinality of the domain is exactly $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3053739"}]}
