To formalize this, mathematicians developed algebraic structures called Heyting algebras, which serve as models for intuitionistic logic. The defining feature of a Heyting algebra is its special implication operator, $x \\to y$, which captures the idea of a construction that turns a proof of $x$ into a proof of $y$. This first exercise gives you a direct, hands-on opportunity to compute this implication from its fundamental definition in a simple, non-classical lattice, allowing you to build a concrete understanding of its unique behavior.

A Heyting algebra is a bounded distributive lattice equipped with a binary operation $\\to$ (implication) such that, for all elements $x,y,z$, the residuation property holds: $x\\wedge z\\le y$ if and only if $z\\le x\\to y$. This algebraic clause is the lattice-theoretic reflection of the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov (BHK) interpretation of implication, which reads a proof of $x\\to y$ as a construction transforming any proof of $x$ into a proof of $y$.\n\nUsing only the basic lattice operations on the chain $\\{0<a<1\\}$ and the defining residuation property of implication in a Heyting algebra, compute the three implication values $a\\to 0$, $a\\to a$, and $a\\to 1$.

The lattice operations of meet ($\\wedge$) and join ($\\vee$) are defined as the minimum and maximum of any two elements, respectively. The lattice is bounded, with the bottom element being $0$ and the top element being $1$.\n\nThe implication operation $x \\to y$ is defined by the residuation property: for any elements $x, y, z \\in L$, the relation $x \\wedge z \\le y$ holds if and only if $z \\le x \\to y$. This property implies that $x \\to y$ is the greatest element $z$ in the lattice $L$ that satisfies the inequality $x \\wedge z \\le y$. Formally, this can be expressed as:\n$$x \\to y = \\max\\{z \\in L \\mid x \\wedge z \\le y\\}$$\nWe will use this definition to compute the required values.

The result of the evaluation is $a$. In the problem statement, the algebra is defined with the total order $0 < a < 1$. By this very definition, it is given that $a < 1$. This completes the proof.\n\nFinally, we justify this result in the context of the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov (BHK) interpretation.

It is a demonstration that $P$ is unprovable.\n\nIn this framework, the law of excluded middle, $P \\lor \\neg P$, is not a tautology. A proof of $P \\lor \\neg P$ would require that for any proposition $P$, we must have either a proof of $P$ or a proof of $\\neg P$.

Since $0 \\neq 1$, we interpret this as not having a proof of $\\neg p$.\n\nSince we have neither a proof of $p$ nor a proof of $\\neg p$, according to the BHK interpretation, we cannot assert the disjunction $p \\lor \\neg p$. Our calculation reflects this perfectly:\n$$ p \\lor \\neg p = a $$\nThe result is $a$, which is not $1$. The failure of the expression to evaluate to $1$ in this algebraic model corresponds to the failure of the law of excluded middle to be a theorem in intuitionistic logic.

We must also verify the construction and relate it to the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov (BHK) interpretation.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the condition that must be met at the root world, $w_0$, of our model: $w_0 \\not\\Vdash p \\lor \\neg p$.\nAccording to the forcing definition for disjunction ($\\lor$), this is equivalent to the conjunction of two conditions:\n$1$. $w_0 \\not\\Vdash p$\n$2$. $w_0 \\not\\Vdash \\neg p$\n\nLet's expand these two conditions.\nCondition $1$, $w_0 \\not\\Vdash p$, means that the world $w_0$ is not in the valuation set for $p$. That is, $w_0 \\notin V(p)$.\n\nCondition $2$, $w_0 \\not\\Vdash \\neg p$, uses the definition $\\neg\\varphi \\equiv \\varphi \\to \\bot$. So we have $w_0 \\not\\Vdash p \\to \\bot$.\nAccording to the forcing definition for implication ($\\to$), the statement $w_0 \\Vdash p \\to \\bot$ means that for all worlds $v \\in W$ such that $w_0 \\leq v$, if $v \\Vdash p$, then $v \\Vdash \\bot$.\nTherefore, its negation, $w_0 \\not\\Vdash p \\to \\bot$, means that there exists at least one world $v \\in W$ such that $w_0 \\leq v$ AND it is true that $v \\Vdash p$ AND it is false that $v \\Vdash \\bot$.\nSince by definition $v \\not\\Vdash \\bot$ for any world $v$, this simplifies to: There exists a world $v \\in W$ such that $w_0 \\leq v$ and $v \\Vdash p$.\n\nSo, to construct our model with root $w_0$, we must satisfy:\n(a) $w_0 \\notin V(p)$ (which implies $w_0 \\not\\Vdash p$).\n(b) There exists a world $v$ such that $w_0 \\leq v$ and $v \\in V(p)$ (which implies $v \\Vdash p$).\n\nNow, we find the model with the minimum number of worlds. Let $N$ be this number.\n\nCan $N=1$?\nIf we have only one world, $W = \\{w_0\\}$, the only relation in the partial order is $w_0 \\leq w_0$.\nCondition (a) requires $w_0 \\notin V(p)$.\nCondition (b) requires the existence of a $v$ with $w_0 \\leq v$ where $v \\in V(p)$. Since $w_0$ is the only world, we must have $v=w_0$. This means we must have $w_0 \\in V(p)$.\nThis leads to a contradiction: we need $w_0 \\notin V(p)$ and $w_0 \\in V(p)$ simultaneously. Therefore, a one-world model is impossible, and $N > 1$.\n\nCan $N=2$?\nLet's try to build a model with two worlds, $W = \\{w_0, w_1\\}$. To satisfy condition (b), we need an accessible world from $w_0$ where $p$ is forced. Let's establish the partial order $w_0 \\leq w_1$. To make this a partial order, we also need reflexivity: $w_0 \\leq w_0$ and $w_1 \\leq w_1$. So the frame is $(W, \\leq)$ with $W = \\{w_0, w_1\\}$ and the order defined by $w_0 \\leq w_0$, $w_1 \\leq w_1$, and $w_0 \\leq w_1$. The world $w_0$ is the root.\n\nNow we define the valuation $V(p)$.\nFrom condition (a), we must have $w_0 \\not\\Vdash p$, so $w_0 \\notin V(p)$.\nFrom condition (b), there must be a world $v$ with $w_0 \\leq v$ where $v \\Vdash p$. The worlds accessible from $w_0$ are $w_0$ and $w_1$. We already ruled out $w_0 \\Vdash p$. So we must have $w_1 \\Vdash p$. This means $w_1 \\in V(p)$.\nLet's define the valuation as $V(p) = \\{w_1\\}$. We must check if this valuation is monotone, i.e., if $w \\in V(p)$ and $w \\leq v$, then $v \\in V(p)$. The only non-trivial case to check is for $w=w_1$. The only $v$ such that $w_1 \\leq v$ is $v=w_1$ itself, and $w_1 \\in V(p)$, so the condition holds. The valuation is valid.\n\nSo, we have constructed the following Kripke model:\n- Frame: $W = \\{w_0, w_1\\}$, with the partial order relation $\\leq$ being the reflexive, transitive closure of $\\{ (w_0, w_1) \\}$. In other words, $w_0 \\leq w_0$, $w_1 \\leq w_1$, and $w_0 \\leq w_1$.\n- Valuation: $V(p) = \\{w_1\\}$.\n\nSince we have shown $N > 1$ and found a model with $N=2$, the minimal number of worlds is $N=2$.\n\nNow, we explicitly verify the forcing of $p$, $\\neg p$, and $p \\lor \\neg p$ at each world.\n\nVerification at world $w_0$:\n- $p$: $w_0 \\Vdash p$ if and only if $w_0 \\in V(p)$. Since $V(p)=\\{w_1\\}$, we have $w_0 \\notin V(p)$. Thus, $w_0 \\not\\Vdash p$.\n- $\\neg p$: $w_0 \\Vdash \\neg p$ if and only if $w_0 \\Vdash p \\to \\bot$. This means for all $v$ with $w_0 \\leq v$, if $v \\Vdash p$ then $v \\Vdash \\bot$. The worlds $v$ are $w_0$ and $w_1$.\n  - For $v=w_0$: The premise $w_0 \\Vdash p$ is false, so the implication is true.\n  - For $v=w_1$: The premise $w_1 \\Vdash p$ is true (since $w_1 \\in V(p)$). The condition requires that $w_1 \\Vdash \\bot$. This is false by definition.\n  Because the condition fails for $v=w_1$, the universal statement \"for all $v$...\" is false. Thus, $w_0 \\not\\Vdash \\neg p$.\n- $p \\lor \\neg p$: $w_0 \\Vdash p \\lor \\neg p$ if and only if $w_0 \\Vdash p$ or $w_0 \\Vdash \\neg p$. Since we have shown both $w_0 \\not\\Vdash p$ and $w_0 \\not\\Vdash \\neg p$, it follows that $w_0 \\not\\Vdash p \\lor \\neg p$. This confirms that our model is a counter-model.\n\nVerification at world $w_1$:\n- $p$: $w_1 \\Vdash p$ if and only if $w_1 \\in V(p)$. This is true by our definition of $V(p)$. Thus, $w_1 \\Vdash p$.\n- $\\neg p$: $w_1 \\Vdash \\neg p$ if and only if for all $v$ with $w_1 \\leq v$, if $v \\Vdash p$ then $v \\Vdash \\bot$. The only such world is $v=w_1$ itself. We must check if ($w_1 \\Vdash p \\implies w_1 \\Vdash \\bot$). The premise $w_1 \\Vdash p$ is true, but the conclusion $w_1 \\Vdash \\bot$ is false. The implication is false. Thus, $w_1 \\not\\Vdash \\neg p$.\n- $p \\lor \\neg p$: $w_1 \\Vdash p \\lor \\neg p$ if and only if $w_1 \\Vdash p$ or $w_1 \\Vdash \\neg p$. Since $w_1 \\Vdash p$ is true, the disjunction is true. Thus, $w_1 \\Vdash p \\lor \\neg p$. This is consistent with the monotonicity property of forcing: if a formula is forced at a world, it is forced at all subsequent worlds. However, $p\\lor\\neg p$ is not forced at $w_0$, only at $w_1$.\n\nConnection to the BHK Interpretation:\nThe BHK interpretation understands proofs as constructive objects.\n- A proof of $\\varphi \\lor \\psi$ consists of presenting a proof of $\\varphi$ or presenting a proof of $\\psi$.\n- A proof of $\\neg \\varphi$ (i.e., $\\varphi \\to \\bot$) is a method that converts any hypothetical proof of $\\varphi$ into a proof of a contradiction ($\\bot$).\nThe Kripke worlds can be interpreted as states of knowledge. An arrow $w \\to v$ means that state $v$ is a possible future state of knowledge accessible from state $w$.\n- At world $w_0$, we do not have a proof of $p$ ($w_0 \\not\\Vdash p$).\n- At world $w_0$, we also do not have a proof of $\\neg p$ ($w_0 \\not\\Vdash \\neg p$). A proof of $\\neg p$ would require us to be able to derive a contradiction from a proof of $p$, valid for our current state $w_0$ and all possible future states. However, the existence of the future state $w_1$ where $p$ is proven ($w_1 \\Vdash p$) makes this impossible. We cannot rule out $p$ because it might be proven true later.\n- Since we have neither a proof of $p$ nor a proof of $\\neg p$ at state $w_0$, we cannot, according to the strict constructive requirement of disjunction, assert that we have a proof of $p \\lor \\neg p$. At state $w_0$, the proposition $p$ is undecided. The law of excluded middle fails because intuitionistic logic does not grant that every proposition is decidable at every state of knowledge.\n\nThe constructed two-world model is the minimal structure that captures this idea of an undecided proposition that may be decided in the future. The minimum number of worlds required is $N=2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3045313"}]}
