The quantity to be computed is $D = \\mathbf{1}[\\mathcal{M},w \\models p] - \\mathbf{1}[\\mathcal{M},w \\models \\Box p]$, where $\\mathbf{1}[\\cdot]$ is the indicator function.\n\nWe must determine the truth values of the statements $\\mathcal{M},w \\models p$ and $\\mathcal{M},w \\models \\Box p$ based on the provided semantic clauses.\n\nFirst, we evaluate the satisfaction of the propositional variable $p$ at the world $w$. The definition states that for a propositional variable $q$, $\\mathcal{M},x \\models q$ if and only if $x \\in V(q)$. Applying this to our case, the statement $\\mathcal{M},w \\models p$ is true if and only if $w \\in V(p)$.\nThe given valuation is $V(p) = \\{w\\}$. Since $w$ is an element of the set $\\{w\\}$, the condition $w \\in V(p)$ is satisfied.\nTherefore, the statement $\\mathcal{M},w \\models p$ is true.\nThis implies that the value of the indicator function is $\\mathbf{1}[\\mathcal{M},w \\models p] = 1$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the satisfaction of the formula $\\Box p$ at the world $w$. The definition states that for a formula $\\Box \\varphi$, $\\mathcal{M},x \\models \\Box \\varphi$ if and only if for all $y \\in W$, if $xRy$ then $\\mathcal{M},y \\models \\varphi$.\nApplying this to our case, the statement $\\mathcal{M},w \\models \\Box p$ is true if and only if for all worlds $y \\in W$, the implication \"if $wRy$, then $\\mathcal{M},y \\models p$\" holds.\nThe set of worlds is $W=\\{w,u\\}$, and the accessibility relation from $w$ is defined by $R=\\{(w,u)\\}$. This means the only world $y$ for which the antecedent $wRy$ is true is $y=u$. For any other world in $W$, specifically for $y=w$, the antecedent $wRw$ is false (since $(w,w) \\notin R$), making the implication \"if $wRw$, then $\\mathcal{M},w \\models p$\" vacuously true.\nThus, the universally quantified condition reduces to checking the truth of the implication for the single case where the antecedent is true, which is for $y=u$. The statement $\\mathcal{M},w \\models \\Box p$ is true if and only if the implication \"if $wRu$, then $\\mathcal{M},u \\models p$\" is true.\nWe know from the definition of $R$ that $wRu$ is true. For the implication to be true, its consequent, $\\mathcal{M},u \\models p$, must also be true.\nWe now check the truth of $\\mathcal{M},u \\models p$. According to the satisfaction clause for propositional variables, this holds if and only if $u \\in V(p)$.\nThe valuation is given as $V(p) = \\{w\\}$. The statement $u \\in \\{w\\}$ is false, as $u$ and $w$ are distinct worlds.\nTherefore, the consequent $\\mathcal{M},u \\models p$ is false.\nSince the antecedent $wRu$ is true and the consequent $\\mathcal{M},u \\models p$ is false, the implication \"if $wRu$, then $\\mathcal{M},u \\models p$\" is false.\nBecause we have found a world $y=u$ for which the condition \"if $wRy$, then $\\mathcal{M},y \\models p$\" fails, the universally quantified statement \"for all $y \\in W$, if $wRy$ then $\\mathcal{M},y \\models p$\" is false.\nConsequently, the statement $\\mathcal{M},w \\models \\Box p$ is false.\nThis implies that the value of the indicator function is $\\mathbf{1}[\\mathcal{M},w \\models \\Box p] = 0$.\n\nFinally, we can compute the value of $D$.\n$$\nD = \\mathbf{1}[\\mathcal{M},w \\models p] - \\mathbf{1}[\\mathcal{M},w \\models \\Box p]\n$$\nSubstituting the values we have determined:\n$$\nD = 1 - 0 = 1\n$$\nThe value of the specified quantity is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3047605"}, {"introduction": "Different systems of modal logic are built by adding new axioms to the basic system $K$.

Let us formalize these conditions.\n\nThe Kripke model $(W,R,V)$ must have the following properties:\n1.  The accessibility relation $R$ is reflexive. This means for all $u \\in W$, $(u,u) \\in R$.\n2.  The accessibility relation $R$ is non-transitive. This means there exist $x, y, z \\in W$ such that $(x,y) \\in R$ and $(y,z) \\in R$, but $(x,z) \\notin R$.\n3.  There exists a world $w \\in W$ such that $w \\models \\Box p$.

The condition $v \\not\\models \\Box p$ from point $4$ is itself equivalent to stating that there exists a world $z \\in W$ such that $(v,z) \\in R$ and $z \\not\\models p$.\n\nWe seek to find the minimum value of $n = |W|$.\n\nFirst, we will establish a lower bound for $n$.\n\nCase $n=1$: Let $W = \\{w_1\\}$. For $R$ to be reflexive, we must have $R = \\{(w_1, w_1)\\}$. To check for transitivity, we must check if for all $x,y,z \\in W$, $(x,y) \\in R$ and $(y,z) \\in R$ implies $(x,z) \\in R$. The only choice is $x=y=z=w_1$. In this case, $(w_1, w_1) \\in R$ and $(w_1, w_1) \\in R$ implies $(w_1, w_1) \\in R$, which is true. Thus, $R$ is transitive. This violates condition $2$. Therefore, $n$ cannot be $1$.\n\nCase $n=2$: Let $W = \\{w_1, w_2\\}$. For $R$ to be reflexive, we must have $\\{(w_1, w_1), (w_2, w_2)\\} \\subseteq R$. To be non-transitive, we require a triple $(x,y,z)$ demonstrating the failure of transitivity. Let's examine the possible non-trivial triples where $x,y,z$ are not all identical. The only interesting structure for a path of length $2$ is of the form $w_i \\to w_j \\to w_k$. Let's test for non-transitivity with $(x,y,z) = (w_1, w_2, w_1)$. This would require $(w_1, w_2) \\in R$ and $(w_2, w_1) \\in R$, but $(w_1, w_1) \\notin R$. However, condition $1$ (reflexivity) requires $(w_1, w_1) \\in R$. So this cannot be a witness to non-transitivity. A similar argument holds for $(x,y,z) = (w_2, w_1, w_2)$. The only other cases are where at least two of $x, y, z$ are identical, such as $(w_1, w_1, w_2)$. This would require $(w_1, w_1) \\in R$ and $(w_1, w_2) \\in R$ but $(w_1, w_2) \\notin R$, which is a direct contradiction. Therefore, any reflexive relation on a set of $2$ worlds is necessarily transitive. This violates condition $2$. Thus, $n$ cannot be $2$.\n\nFrom this analysis, we conclude that we must have $n \\ge 3$.\n\nNow, we will demonstrate that $n=3$ is sufficient by constructing a valid Kripke model.\nLet $W = \\{w_1, w_2, w_3\\}$. Let $w_1$ be the world where the properties are to be evaluated.\nFrom condition $4$, $w_1 \\not\\models \\Box\\Box p$, there must exist a world, which we will call $w_2$, such that $(w_1, w_2) \\in R$ and $w_2 \\not\\models \\Box p$.\nFrom $w_2 \\not\\models \\Box p$, there must exist a world, which we will call $w_3$, such that $(w_2, w_3) \\in R$ and $w_3 \\not\\models p$.\nSo far, we have a chain of relations $w_1 \\to w_2 \\to w_3$ and the valuation $w_3 \\notin V(p)$.\n\nNow let's incorporate condition $3$, $w_1 \\models \\Box p$. This requires that for any world $u$ such that $(w_1, u) \\in R$, we must have $u \\models p$.\nSince $(w_1, w_2) \\in R$, it must be that $w_2 \\models p$.\nAlso, condition $1$ requires $R$ to be reflexive, so $(w_1, w_1) \\in R$. This implies that $w_1 \\models p$.\nSo we have $w_1 \\in V(p)$ and $w_2 \\in V(p)$.\n\nLet's check for condition $2$, non-transitivity. We have $(w_1, w_2) \\in R$ and $(w_2, w_3) \\in R$. If $R$ were transitive, this would imply $(w_1, w_3) \\in R$. If $(w_1, w_3) \\in R$, then by condition $3$ ($w_1 \\models \\Box p$), it would have to be the case that $w_3 \\models p$. However, we established from condition $4$ that $w_3 \\not\\models p$. This is a contradiction. Therefore, to satisfy all conditions simultaneously, we must ensure that $(w_1, w_3) \\notin R$. The existence of the chain $w_1 \\to w_2 \\to w_3$ with $(w_1, w_3) \\notin R$ makes the relation $R$ non-transitive, satisfying condition $2$.\n\nLet's consolidate these findings to construct a specific model with $|W|=3$.\nLet $W = \\{w_1, w_2, w_3\\}$.\nDefine the relation $R \\subseteq W \\times W$ as the minimal relation satisfying our requirements:\n- Reflexivity: $(w_1, w_1), (w_2, w_2), (w_3, w_3) \\in R$.\n- The chain from our logical analysis: $(w_1, w_2) \\in R, (w_2, w_3) \\in R$.\nSo, let $R = \\{(w_1, w_1), (w_2, w_2), (w_3, w_3), (w_1, w_2), (w_2, w_3)\\}$.\n\nDefine the valuation $V$ for the propositional variable $p$:\n- From our analysis, we require $w_1 \\models p$, $w_2 \\models p$, and $w_3 \\not\\models p$.\nSo, let $V(p) = \\{w_1, w_2\\}$.\n\nNow, we verify that this model $(W, R, V)$ satisfies all conditions with $w = w_1$:\n1.  $R$ is reflexive: All pairs $(u,u)$ for $u \\in W$ are in $R$ by construction.\n2.  $R$ is non-transitive: We have $(w_1, w_2) \\in R$ and $(w_2, w_3) \\in R$, but $(w_1, w_3) \\notin R$. So $R$ is not transitive.\n3.  $w_1 \\models \\Box p$: The worlds accessible from $w_1$ are $w_1$ and $w_2$. We must check if $p$ holds at both. $V(p) = \\{w_1, w_2\\}$, so $w_1 \\models p$ and $w_2 \\models p$. The condition holds.\n4.  $w_1 \\not\\models \\Box\\Box p$: We need to find a successor $v$ of $w_1$ such that $v \\not\\models \\Box p$. Let's test $v=w_2$.\n    - Do we have $w_2 \\not\\models \\Box p$? This requires finding a successor $z$ of $w_2$ such that $z \\not\\models p$. The worlds accessible from $w_2$ are $w_2$ and $w_3$.\n    - For $z=w_2$, we have $w_2 \\models p$ since $w_2 \\in V(p)$. This does not help.\n    - For $z=w_3$, we have $w_3 \\not\\models p$ since $w_3 \\notin V(p)$.
