This biconditional should hold for any adequate definition of truth.\n\nTo be a \"correct example\" of a T-sentence, a given biconditional must satisfy two structural requirements derived from the definition:\n1.  The object inside the Gödel code notation, $\\varphi$ in $\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner$, must be a **sentence** of the language $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{A}}$. A sentence is a well-formed formula with no free variables. The predicate $T$ is defined only over the Gödel codes of sentences.\n2.

Is $\\varphi$ a sentence? The formula $0=0$ is constructed from the constant symbol $0$ and the equality relation. It contains no variables, and thus no free variables. Therefore, $0=0$ is a sentence of $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{A}}$.\n2.  Does the expression match the form $T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\varphi$? Yes, the sentence on the right is identical to the sentence inside the Gödel code on the left.\nSemantically, the sentence $0=0$ is true in $\\mathbb{N}$, so $T(\\ulcorner 0=0\\urcorner)$ is a true assertion. The right-hand side, $0=0$, is also a true statement. The biconditional is $True \\leftrightarrow True$, which is true.

Is $\\varphi$ a sentence? The formula $x+0=x$ contains the variable $x$. However, the universal quantifier $\\forall x$ binds this variable. As there are no other variables, the formula has no free variables and is a sentence.\n2.  Does the expression match the form $T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\varphi$? Yes, the sentence on the right is identical to the sentence inside the Gödel code on the left.\nSemantically, the sentence $\\forall x\\,(x+0=x)$ is true in $\\mathbb{N}$ (it is the axiom for the identity element of addition). Thus, $T(\\ulcorner \\forall x\\,(x+0=x)\\urcorner)$ is true, and the RHS is also a true arithmetical statement. The biconditional holds.

Here, $1$ is an abbreviation for $S(0)$. So the formula is $\\exists x\\,(x=x+S(0))$.\n1.  Is $\\varphi$ a sentence? The formula $x=x+1$ has a free variable $x$. The existential quantifier $\\exists x$ binds this variable. Thus, the formula is a sentence.\n2.  Does the expression match the form $T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\varphi$? Yes, the structure is correct.\nConvention T must hold for all sentences, regardless of their truth value. Semantically, the sentence $\\exists x\\,(x=x+1)$ is false in $\\mathbb{N}$. Therefore, the assertion $T(\\ulcorner \\exists x\\,(x=x+1)\\urcorner)$ is false. The assertion on the right-hand side, $\\exists x\\,(x=x+1)$, is also false. The biconditional is $False \\leftrightarrow False$, which is true.

Is $\\psi$ a sentence? No. The formula $x+0=x$ contains a **free variable** $x$. It is not a sentence.\nThe truth predicate $T$ is defined for sentences, not for formulas with free variables. The truth of $\\psi$ is not determined until a value from the domain is assigned to $x$. Therefore, the expression $T(\\ulcorner x+0=x\\urcorner)$ is malformed according to the problem's definition of $T$. This option fails the first criterion.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. $T(\\ulcorner \\forall x\\exists y\\,(y=x+1)\\urcorner)\\leftrightarrow \\exists y\\forall x\\,(y=x+1)$\nLet $\\varphi \\equiv \\forall x\\exists y\\,(y=x+1)$ and $\\psi \\equiv \\exists y\\forall x\\,(y=x+1)$.\n1.  The formula $\\varphi$ is a sentence, as all its variables are bound. So the left-hand side $T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner)$ is well-formed.\n2.  Does the expression match the form $T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\varphi$? No. The expression is of the form $T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\psi$, but $\\varphi$ is not syntactically identical to $\\psi$. The order of quantifiers has been swapped, resulting in a logically distinct sentence. This is not a T-sentence for $\\varphi$.\nSemantically, $\\varphi$ is true in $\\mathbb{N}$ (for every number, there is a successor), so $T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner)$ is true. However, $\\psi$ is false in $\\mathbb{N}$ (there is no number that is the successor of all numbers). The biconditional is $True \\leftrightarrow False$, which is false. This demonstrates precisely why the sentence on the right must be identical to the one on the left.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nF. $T(\\ulcorner \\neg\\exists x\\,(x0)\\urcorner)\\leftrightarrow \\neg\\exists x\\,(x0)$\nLet $\\varphi$ be the formula $\\neg\\exists x\\,(x0)$.\n1.  Is $\\varphi$ a sentence? The subformula $x0$ has a free variable $x$. The quantifier $\\exists x$ binds it, forming the sentence $\\exists x\\,(x0)$. The negation of a sentence is a sentence. So, $\\varphi$ is a sentence.\n2.  Does the expression match the form $T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\varphi$? Yes, the structure is correct.\nSemantically, the sentence $\\neg\\exists x\\,(x0)$ states that there is no natural number less than $0$. This is true in $\\mathbb{N}=\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.

The tasks are: to compute a specific Gödel code, to evaluate the truth of a sentence, and to demonstrate Tarski's undefinability of truth. I will address each task in sequence.\n\nFirst, we compute the Gödel code of the sentence $S(S(0)) = \\mathtt{2}$. The problem specifies a Gödel coding scheme based on prime factorization. The sentence, when written as a linear string of symbols, is $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\sigma_3\\sigma_4\\sigma_5\\sigma_6\\sigma_7\\sigma_8\\sigma_9$, which corresponds to the sequence of symbols:\n$S, (, S, (, 0, ), ), =, \\mathtt{2}$\n\nWe are given the symbol-code map $c$:\n$c(\\mathtt{(})=1$\n$c(\\mathtt{)})=2$\n$c(\\mathtt{S})=3$\n$c(\\mathtt{0})=4$\n$c(\\mathtt{=})=5$\n$c(\\mathtt{2})=6$\n\nApplying this map to our sequence of symbols $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\cdots\\sigma_9$:\n$c(\\sigma_1) = c(S) = 3$\n$c(\\sigma_2) = c(() = 1$\n$c(\\sigma_3) = c(S) = 3$\n$c(\\sigma_4) = c(() = 1$\n$c(\\sigma_5) = c(0) = 4$\n$c(\\sigma_6) = c()) = 2$\n$c(\\sigma_7) = c()) = 2$\n$c(\\sigma_8) = c(=) = 5$\n$c(\\sigma_9) = c(\\mathtt{2}) = 6$\n\nThe Gödel code is defined as $\\ulcorner \\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\cdots\\sigma_n \\urcorner = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} p_i^{\\,c(\\sigma_i)}$, where $p_i$ is the $i$-th prime number. For our $9$-symbol sentence, we need the first $9$ primes:\n$p_1=2, p_2=3, p_3=5, p_4=7, p_5=11, p_6=13, p_7=17, p_8=19, p_9=23$.\n\nWe construct the product:\n$\\ulcorner S(S(0))=\\mathtt{2} \\urcorner = p_1^{c(\\sigma_1)} \\times p_2^{c(\\sigma_2)} \\times p_3^{c(\\sigma_3)} \\times p_4^{c(\\sigma_4)} \\times p_5^{c(\\sigma_5)} \\times p_6^{c(\\sigma_6)} \\times p_7^{c(\\sigma_7)} \\times p_8^{c(\\sigma_8)} \\times p_9^{c(\\sigma_9)}$\nSubstituting the values for the primes and the codes, we obtain:\n$\\ulcorner S(S(0))=\\mathtt{2} \\urcorner = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^4 \\cdot 13^2 \\cdot 17^2 \\cdot 19^5 \\cdot 23^6$.\nThis is the exact prime-power product for the Gödel code as requested.\n\nSecond, we determine the truth value of the sentence $S(S(0)) = \\mathtt{2}$ in the standard model of Peano Arithmetic, which is the structure of the natural numbers $\\mathbb{N} = \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}$.\nThe interpretation of the symbols in $\\mathbb{N}$ is as follows:\n- The symbol $0$ is interpreted as the number $0 \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n- The function symbol $S$ is interpreted as the successor function, $S(n) = n+1$ for any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n- The symbol $=$ is interpreted as the relation of identity on $\\mathbb{N}$.\n- The problem states that the symbol $\\mathtt{2}$ is an abbreviation for the term $S(S(0))$. A numeral is a term in the language that denotes a number.\n\nLet us evaluate the term $S(S(0))$ in $\\mathbb{N}$:\n- The interpretation of $S(0)$ is $S(0) = 0+1 = 1$.\n- The interpretation of $S(S(0))$ is $S(1) = 1+1 = 2$.\nSo, the left-hand side of the equation refers to the number $2$.\n\nThe right-hand side is the symbol $\\mathtt{2}$, which is explicitly stated to be an abbreviation for the term $S(S(0))$. Therefore, its intended interpretation is the same as that of $S(S(0))$, which is the number $2$.\n\nThe sentence $S(S(0)) = \\mathtt{2}$ thus asserts that the number denoted by $S(S(0))$ is identical to the number denoted by $\\mathtt{2}$. In the standard model, this statement is $2=2$. This is a true statement.\nTherefore, the sentence $S(S(0)) = \\mathtt{2}$ is true in $\\mathbb{N}$.\n\nThird, we address Tarski's undefinability theorem. We must show that no formula $T(x)$ in the language $\\mathcal{L}$ can define the set of true sentences of arithmetic. The proof is by contradiction, using the diagonal lemma.\n\n1.  Assume for contradiction that such a formula $T(x)$ exists. This formula has one free variable, $x$. The property of $T(x)$ is that for any sentence $\\varphi$ in the language $\\mathcal{L}$, $T(x)$ is true in the standard model $\\mathbb{N}$ when $x$ is assigned the Gödel number of $\\varphi$, if and only if $\\varphi$ itself is true in $\\mathbb{N}$. Formally, using $\\models$ to denote truth in a model:\n    For every sentence $\\varphi$ of $\\mathcal{L}$, $\\mathbb{N} \\models T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\iff \\mathbb{N} \\models \\varphi$.\n    Here, $\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner$ represents the numeral corresponding to the Gödel number of $\\varphi$.\n\n2.  Consider the formula with one free variable $x$, given by $\\neg T(x)$. This is a valid formula in the language of PA.\n\n3.  We invoke the diagonal lemma. The lemma states that for any formula $\\theta(x)$ with one free variable, there exists a sentence $G$ such that the equivalence $G \\leftrightarrow \\theta(\\ulcorner G \\urcorner)$ is provable in Peano Arithmetic (PA).\n    Let's apply the lemma to our formula $\\theta(x) = \\neg T(x)$. The lemma guarantees the existence of a sentence $G$ (often called the \"liar sentence\") such that:\n    $PA \\vdash G \\leftrightarrow \\neg T(\\ulcorner G \\urcorner)$\n\n4.  Since this equivalence is provable in PA, and since the axioms of PA are true in the standard model $\\mathbb{N}$, the equivalence must also be true in $\\mathbb{N}$.\n    $\\mathbb{N} \\models G \\leftrightarrow \\neg T(\\ulcorner G \\urcorner)$\n    This means that the sentence $G$ is true in $\\mathbb{N}$ if and only if the sentence $\\neg T(\\ulcorner G \\urcorner)$ is true in $\\mathbb{N}$. By the definition of negation, this is equivalent to:\n    $(\\mathbb{N} \\models G)$ is true $\\iff$ $(\\mathbb{N} \\models T(\\ulcorner G \\urcorner))$ is false.\n\n5.  Now we use the defining property of our hypothetical truth predicate $T(x)$ from step 1, applied to the specific sentence $G$:\n    $(\\mathbb{N} \\models T(\\ulcorner G \\urcorner))$ is true $\\iff$ $(\\mathbb{N} \\models G)$ is true.\n\n6.  We have derived two necessary conditions. Let $P$ be the proposition \"$\\mathbb{N} \\models G$\" (i.e., \"$G$ is true\"). Let $Q$ be the proposition \"$\\mathbb{N} \\models T(\\ulcorner G \\urcorner)$\" (i.e., \"$T(\\ulcorner G \\urcorner)$ is true\").\n    From step 4 (the diagonal lemma): $P \\iff \\neg Q$.\n    From step 5 (the property of $T(x)$): $P \\iff Q$.\n    Combining these, we get $Q \\iff \\neg Q$.\n\n7.  This is a formal contradiction. A proposition cannot be equivalent to its own negation. If $Q$ were true, it must be false. If $Q$ were false, it must be true. This is impossible in classical logic.\n\n8.  The contradiction arises from the initial assumption that a truth-defining formula $T(x)$ exists within the language of PA. Therefore, this assumption must be false. We conclude that there is no formula in $\\mathcal{L}$ that defines the set of Gödel numbers of true sentences of arithmetic. This is Tarski's undefinability of truth theorem.\n\nThe truth of a sentence like $S(S(0)) = \\mathtt{2}$ is evaluable because we can step \"outside\" the formal system of PA and use a meta-theory (like set theory) where the standard model $\\mathbb{N}$ is an object we can inspect. We interpret the symbols and perform calculations in this meta-theory. However, Tarski's theorem shows that the formal system of PA itself is not strong enough to formalize this \"outside\" notion of truth for all of its own sentences.

This is a universally quantified sentence, so we apply Clause $4$:\n$$\nT_{b}(\\operatorname{gn}(\\forall y\\, \\neg(\\overline{b}  y))) = \\min\\bigl\\{\\, T_{b}(\\operatorname{gn}(\\neg(\\overline{b}  \\overline{0}))),\\, \\dots,\\, T_{b}(\\operatorname{gn}(\\neg(\\overline{b}  \\overline{b}))) \\,\\bigr\\}\n$$\nThe value of each term in this minimum, $T_{b}(\\operatorname{gn}(\\neg(\\overline{b}  \\overline{j})))$ for $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, b\\}$, depends on the evaluation of the subformula $\\overline{b}  \\overline{j}$. This subformula is an abbreviation for $\\overline{b} \\leq \\overline{j} \\wedge \\neg(\\overline{b} = \\overline{j})$. The recursive evaluation for this structure depends on Clauses $1$, $2$, and $3$. Clause $1$ correctly evaluates the truth of atomic sentences like $\\overline{b} \\leq \\overline{j}$ and $\\overline{b} = \\overline{j}$ in $\\mathbb{N}$. Clauses $2$ and $3$ correctly propagate the truth values for boolean connectives. Thus, for any quantifier-free sentence $\\theta$, $T_b(\\operatorname{gn}(\\theta))$ yields its actual truth value in $\\mathbb{N}$.\n\nFor any $j$ in the range $\\{0, 1, \\dots, b\\}$, the relation $b  j$ is false in $\\mathbb{N}$. Therefore, the evaluation $T_{b}(\\operatorname{gn}(\\overline{b}  \\overline{j}))$ must be $0$:\n$$\nT_{b}(\\operatorname{gn}(\\overline{b}  \\overline{j})) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, b\\}\n$$\nUsing Clause $2$, we then evaluate the negation:\n$$\nT_{b}(\\operatorname{gn}(\\neg(\\overline{b}  \\overline{j}))) = 1 - T_{b}(\\operatorname{gn}(\\overline{b}  \\overline{j})) = 1 - 0 = 1\n$$\nThis holds for every $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, b\\}$. Now, we can compute the minimum for the universal quantifier over $y$:\n$$\nT_{b}(\\operatorname{gn}(\\forall y\\, \\neg(\\overline{b}  y))) = \\min\\{1, 1, \\dots, 1\\} = 1\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the evaluation of the existentially quantified formula:\n$$\nT_{b}(\\operatorname{gn}(\\exists y\\, (\\overline{b}  y))) = 1 - T_{b}(\\operatorname{gn}(\\forall y\\, \\neg(\\overline{b}  y))) = 1 - 1 = 0\n$$\nWe have found that the term for $k=b$ in the initial expansion, $T_{b}(\\operatorname{gn}(\\varphi(\\overline{b})))$, is $0$. The full evaluation of $T_{b}(\\operatorname{gn}(\\psi))$ is the minimum of a set of values that includes this $0$:\n$$\nT_{b}(\\operatorname{gn}(\\psi)) = \\min\\bigl\\{\\, T_{b}(\\operatorname{gn}(\\varphi(\\overline{0}))), \\dots, T_{b}(\\operatorname{gn}(\\varphi(\\overline{b-1}))), 0 \\,\\bigr\\} = 0\n$$\nFor any finite $b \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the bounded recursion evaluates $T_{b}(\\operatorname{gn}(\\psi))$ to be $0$, which contradicts the fact that $\\psi$ is true in $\\mathbb{N}$.\n\nThe source of this failure can be pinpointed in the calculation. The step that produced the incorrect result was the evaluation of $T_{b}(\\operatorname{gn}(\\forall y\\, \\neg(\\overline{b}  y)))$. This step returned $1$, suggesting that $\\forall y\\, \\neg(\\overline{b}  y)$ is true. However, this sentence is false in $\\mathbb{N}$, as a counterexample exists (e.g., $y = b+1$). The recursion failed to find this counterexample because its search for a witness $y$ was limited by the bound $b$. The standard definition of truth for a universal quantifier requires checking satisfaction for all elements of the domain $\\mathbb{N}$, which is an infinite set. Clause $4$ replaces this infinite check with a finite one, testing only up to the bound $b$. This restriction is the fundamental flaw. The semantics of the universal quantifier necessarily require unbounded quantification to match the standard truth definition. Therefore, the clause responsible for the failure is Clause $4$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4}\n$$", "id": "3054355"}]}
