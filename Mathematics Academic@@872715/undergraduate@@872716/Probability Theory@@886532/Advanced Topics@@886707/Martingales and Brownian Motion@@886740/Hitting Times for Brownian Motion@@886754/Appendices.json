The initial voltage at $t=0$ is $V(0) = v_0$. The sensor's behavior is governed by a two-stage process determined by voltage thresholds.\n\n**Stage 1:** The initial voltage is $V(0) = v_0 = -65$ millivolts (mV). The process evolves until the voltage first hits either a 'fire' threshold at $v_F = -55$ mV or an 'inhibit' threshold at $v_I = -70$ mV. If the voltage hits $v_I$ first, the entire process terminates. If the voltage hits $v_F$ first, the sensor immediately proceeds to Stage 2.\n\n**Stage 2:** Upon hitting the 'fire' threshold $v_F$, the voltage is instantaneously reset to a new value $v_1 = -40$ mV. From this new state, the voltage continues to evolve as a standard Brownian motion until it first hits either a 'success' threshold at $v_S = 0$ mV or a 'reset' threshold at $v_R = -90$ mV. Hitting either of these thresholds terminates the process.\n\nThe overall process is considered a 'success' only if the 'success' threshold $v_S$ is reached in Stage 2.
