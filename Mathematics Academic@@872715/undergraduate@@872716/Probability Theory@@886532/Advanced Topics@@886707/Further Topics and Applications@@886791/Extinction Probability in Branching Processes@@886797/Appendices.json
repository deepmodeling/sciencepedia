All other probabilities $P(X=k)$ for $k \\notin \\{0, 3\\}$ are zero.\n\nThis scenario describes a Galton-Watson branching process. A fundamental result in the theory of branching processes states that the probability of ultimate extinction, denoted by $q$, is the smallest non-negative root of the equation $s = G(s)$, where $G(s)$ is the probability generating function (PGF) of the offspring distribution.\n\nThe PGF, $G(s)$, is defined as:\n$$G(s) = E[s^X] = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} P(X=k) s^k$$\n\nFor the given offspring distribution, the PGF is:\n$$G(s) = P(X=0)s^0 + P(X=3)s^3$$\n$$G(s) = p_0 + (1-p_0)s^3$$\n\nThe extinction probability $q$ must satisfy the equation $q = G(q)$.

The mean number of offspring is $\\mu = G'(1)$. The derivative of the PGF is $G'(s) = 3(1-p_0)s^2$. At $s=1$, the mean is $\\mu = G'(1) = 3(1-p_0)$. With $p_0 = 3/7$, the mean is $\\mu = 3(1 - 3/7) = 3(4/7) = 12/7$. Since $\\mu  1$, the probability of extinction is not 1, which is consistent with the given information that $q = 1/2  1$. The equation for the fixed points is $s = \\frac{3}{7} + \\frac{4}{7}s^3$, or $7s = 3 + 4s^3$, which is $4s^3 - 7s + 3 = 0$. We know $s=1$ is always a root. We also know from our calculation that $s=1/2$ is a root. Since the sum of the roots of this cubic equation is 0 (the coefficient of $s^2$ is zero), the third root must be $-(1+1/2) = -3/2$.
