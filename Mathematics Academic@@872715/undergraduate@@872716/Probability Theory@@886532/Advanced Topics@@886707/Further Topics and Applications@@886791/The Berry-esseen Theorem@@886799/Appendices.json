Consider a sequence of $n$ bits transmitted through a noisy channel. Let the event of an error in the $i$-th bit be represented by a random variable $X_i$, where $X_i=1$ if an error occurs and $X_i=0$ if the transmission is successful. Assume the errors are independent and occur with a constant probability $p$.
