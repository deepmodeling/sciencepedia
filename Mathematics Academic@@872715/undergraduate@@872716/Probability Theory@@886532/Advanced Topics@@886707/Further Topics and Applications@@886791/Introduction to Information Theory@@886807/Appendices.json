The optimal such code is a Huffman code, whose expected length is minimal among all binary prefix codes.\n\nGiven probabilities: $P(\\text{A})=0.4$, $P(\\text{C})=0.2$, $P(\\text{G})=0.2$, $P(\\text{T})=0.1$, $P(\\text{U})=0.1$.\n\nApply the Huffman algorithm by repeatedly merging the two least-probable symbols/nodes and assigning an extra bit to all leaves within the merged node each time:\n- Merge $\\text{T}$ and $\\text{U}$: $0.1+0.1=0.2$. This gives both $\\text{T}$ and $\\text{U}$ one extra bit of length so far.\n- Now the multiset of weights is $\\{0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2\\}$.

However, all real-world communication channels are subject to noise, which can corrupt the data. This final practice [@problem_id:1367053] shifts our focus to the transmission process, using the Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) as a simple but powerful model for noise. You will analyze a system where information passes through two such channels in sequence, a common scenario in relay-based communications. Determining the overall error probability of the combined system is a crucial step in understanding and engineering robust communication networks.", "problem": "A deep-space probe is transmitting scientific data back to a central command on Earth. The communication is prone to errors and consists of two stages. First, the probe transmits a binary signal (a sequence of 0s and 1s) to a relay satellite orbiting Earth. Second, the relay satellite amplifies and re-transmits the received signal to the ground station at central command.\n\nEach of these two communication links (probe-to-satellite and satellite-to-ground) can be modeled as an independent and identical Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). A BSC is a communication channel that transmits one binary digit at a time, where each bit has a certain probability of being \"flipped\" (i.e., a 0 becomes a 1, or a 1 becomes a 0). This flipping event is called a crossover. For each of the two links in this system, the crossover probability is given by $p$, where $0 < p < 1$.\n\nThe entire two-stage process, from the probe to the central command, can be viewed as a single, equivalent communication channel. This equivalent channel is also a BSC. Determine the crossover probability of this equivalent channel, expressed as a function of $p$.", "solution": "Let $X \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ be the bit transmitted by the deep-space probe, $Y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ be the bit received by the relay satellite, and $Z \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ be the bit received by the central command.\n\nThe system consists of two independent Binary Symmetric Channels (BSCs) connected in series. The first channel maps $X$ to $Y$, and the second channel maps $Y$ to $Z$.\n\nFor the first BSC (probe-to-satellite), the crossover probability is $p$. This can be expressed using conditional probabilities:\n$P(Y=1|X=0) = p$ (a '0' is flipped to a '1')\n$P(Y=0|X=1) = p$ (a '1' is flipped to a '0')\nThe probability of correct transmission for the first channel is therefore $1-p$:\n$P(Y=0|X=0) = 1-p$\n$P(Y=1|X=1) = 1-p$\n\nThe second BSC (satellite-to-ground) is identical and independent, with input $Y$ and output $Z$. Its probabilities are:\n$P(Z=1|Y=0) = p$\n$P(Z=0|Y=1) = p$\nAnd for correct transmission:\n$P(Z=0|Y=0) = 1-p$\n$P(Z=1|Y=1) = 1-p$\n\nWe need to find the crossover probability of the equivalent channel, which we can denote as $p_{eq}$. By the definition of a BSC, this is the probability that the final output bit $Z$ is different from the initial input bit $X$. Due to the symmetry of the system, this probability is the same whether the input is 0 or 1. Let's calculate $p_{eq} = P(Z=1|X=0)$.\n\nTo find $P(Z=1|X=0)$, we can use the law of total probability by marginalizing over the intermediate variable $Y$. The bit $Y$ can be either 0 or 1.\n$$p_{eq} = P(Z=1|X=0) = \\sum_{y \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(Z=1, Y=y | X=0)$$\nUsing the chain rule for conditional probability, $P(A, B | C) = P(A | B, C)P(B | C)$, this becomes:\n$$p_{eq} = P(Z=1|Y=0, X=0)P(Y=0|X=0) + P(Z=1|Y=1, X=0)P(Y=1|X=0)$$\nSince the two channels are independent, the output of the second channel $Z$ depends only on its input $Y$, and not on the original signal $X$. This is a characteristic of a Markov chain $X \\to Y \\to Z$. Thus, we can simplify the conditional probabilities:\n$P(Z=1|Y=0, X=0) = P(Z=1|Y=0)$\n$P(Z=1|Y=1, X=0) = P(Z=1|Y=1)$\n\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $p_{eq}$:\n$$p_{eq} = P(Z=1|Y=0)P(Y=0|X=0) + P(Z=1|Y=1)P(Y=1|X=0)$$\nNow we substitute the known probabilities for each channel:\n- $P(Z=1|Y=0) = p$ (a crossover occurs in the second channel)\n- $P(Y=0|X=0) = 1-p$ (correct transmission in the first channel)\n- $P(Z=1|Y=1) = 1-p$ (correct transmission in the second channel)\n- $P(Y=1|X=0) = p$ (a crossover occurs in the first channel)\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n$$p_{eq} = (p)(1-p) + (1-p)(p)$$\n$$p_{eq} = p - p^{2} + p - p^{2}$$\n$$p_{eq} = 2p - 2p^{2}$$\nThis can be written in factored form as:\n$$p_{eq} = 2p(1-p)$$\nThis expression represents the total probability of a single effective crossover.
