Let the outcome of the $n$-th roll be denoted by the random variable $X_n$, where $n \\geq 1$. An event is classified as a \"tail event\" if its occurrence or non-occurrence is independent of the outcomes of any finite number of initial rolls.

IV only\n\nE. II only\n\nF. I, II, III, and IV", "solution": "To determine which of the given events are tail events, we must analyze each one based on the definition provided. An event is a tail event if its occurrence is not affected by changing any finite number of outcomes at the beginning of the sequence. Let's fix an arbitrary positive integer $m$ and consider changing the first $m$ outcomes, $X_1, \\dots, X_m$. We will check if this modification can alter whether each event occurs.\n\n**Analysis of Event I:**\nThe event is $A_I = \\left\\{ \\sum_{n=1}^{100} X_n \\text{ is even} \\right\\}$. The occurrence of this event depends exclusively on the first 100 outcomes. If we choose $m=101$, the event is entirely determined by the first part of the sequence $(X_1, \\dots, X_{100})$ and has no dependence on the tail $(X_{102}, X_{103}, \\dots)$. For example, if we have a sequence where the sum of the first 100 rolls is odd, and we change $X_1$ from 1 to 2, the sum becomes even, and the event now occurs. Since altering a single initial outcome can change the event's status, Event I is **not** a tail event.\n\n**Analysis of Event II:**\nThe event is $A_{II} = \\{ \\text{The number 6 appears a finite number of times} \\}$. Let's consider the effect of altering the first $m$ outcomes. This alteration can add, remove, or change the number of 6's within the first $m$ positions. The number of such changes is at most $m$, which is a finite number.\n- If the original sequence had an infinite number of 6's, the new sequence will also have an infinite number of 6's (since $\\infty - m = \\infty$). The event did not occur, and it still does not occur.\n- If the original sequence had a finite number of 6's, the new sequence will also have a finite number of 6's (since a finite number plus or minus a finite number is still finite). The event occurred, and it still occurs.\nIn both cases, changing the first $m$ outcomes does not affect whether the event occurs. Therefore, Event II **is** a tail event.\n\n**Analysis of Event III:**\nThe event is $A_{III} = \\{ \\text{The pattern (1, 2, 3) occurs infinitely often} \\}$. We again consider altering the first $m$ outcomes. A single occurrence of the pattern (1, 2, 3) starting at index $k$ involves outcomes $X_k, X_{k+1}, X_{k+2}$. Altering the first $m$ outcomes can only affect patterns that start at an index $k \\leq m$. This is a finite number of potential starting positions.\n- If the pattern occurred infinitely often in the original sequence, then it must occur infinitely often for indices $k > m$. Changing the first $m$ outcomes does not change this, so the pattern still occurs infinitely often.\n- If the pattern occurred only a finite number of times, then after changing the first $m$ outcomes, it may occur a few more or a few less times, but the total number of occurrences will remain finite.\nThe truth of the statement \"the pattern occurs infinitely often\" is not affected by any finite prefix of the sequence. Therefore, Event III **is** a tail event.\n\n**Analysis of Event IV:**\nThe event is $A_{IV} = \\left\\{ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^n X_k > 3.5 \\right\\}$. Let $S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^n X_k$. We want to see if the value of the limit of the average depends on the first $m$ terms. We can write $S_n$ for $n > m$ as:\n$$ S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^m X_k + \\sum_{k=m+1}^n X_k $$\nThe average is:\n$$ \\frac{S_n}{n} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^m X_k + \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=m+1}^n X_k = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^m X_k + \\frac{n-m}{n} \\left( \\frac{1}{n-m}\\sum_{k=m+1}^n X_k \\right) $$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, the first term $\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^m X_k$ goes to 0 because the sum is a finite value. The factor $\\frac{n-m}{n}$ goes to 1. Let $j = k-m$, then the second sum is $\\frac{1}{n-m} \\sum_{j=1}^{n-m} X_{j+m}$. Let $N=n-m$, this is $\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^N Y_j$ where $Y_j = X_{j+m}$ is the tail sequence. So,\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{S_n}{n} = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^N Y_j $$\nThe limit of the average of the whole sequence is equal to the limit of the average of the tail sequence starting at any position $m+1$. Therefore, whether this limit is greater than 3.5 depends only on the tail of the sequence. Event IV **is** a tail event.\n\n(Note: By Kolmogorov's zero-one law, since the $X_n$ are independent and identically distributed, the probability of any tail event is either 0 or 1. The Strong Law of Large Numbers states that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{S_n}{n} = E[X_1] = 3.5$ with probability 1. Thus, the event $A_{IV}$ has a probability of 0, but it is still a well-defined tail event.)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nEvents II, III, and IV are tail events, while event I is not.

Hence $E_{B}$ is not a tail event.\n\nFor C: $E_{C}=\\left\\{\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{S_n}{n^{2}} = 0\\right\\}$. Let two sequences agree from some $m$ onward.
