While variance is conceptually defined as the expected squared deviation from the mean, $E[(X - E[X])^2]$, it is often calculated using the more convenient formula $\\operatorname{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$. This exercise provides a straightforward application of this formula in a realistic engineering context, allowing you to calculate the variability of sensor measurements directly from its first two moments [@problem_id:1383830].", "problem": "A team of robotics engineers is characterizing the performance of a novel current sensor designed for a robot's motor controller. The sensor's output is sampled by an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) to monitor the current drawn by a motor under a steady load. Let the random variable $I$ represent the measured current in amperes (A). After collecting a very large number of data points, the team's data processing software calculates the following two statistical quantities: the expected value of the current, $E[I] = 7.2$ A, and the expected value of the squared current, $E[I^2] = 53.0$ A$^2$.\n\nUsing these values, calculate the variance of the current measurements, $\\operatorname{Var}(I)$.
