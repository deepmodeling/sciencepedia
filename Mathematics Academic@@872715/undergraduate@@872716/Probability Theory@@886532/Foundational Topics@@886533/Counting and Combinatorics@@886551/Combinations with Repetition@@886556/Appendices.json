The six funds are: a quantum computing fund, a synthetic biology fund, a next-generation battery fund, a decentralized finance fund, a space exploration fund, and an advanced materials fund. Due to the firm's investment policies, capital must be allocated in discrete blocks of $10,000. Any number of blocks, including zero, can be allocated to any of the six funds, as long as the total sum allocated is exactly $300,000. How many different allocation strategies are possible?", "solution": "Let $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6$ denote the number of allocated blocks of size $10{,}000$ dollars to the six funds, respectively. Each $x_i$ must be a non-negative integer, and the total allocation constraint is exactly $300{,}000$ dollars. Since each block is $10{,}000$ dollars, the total number of blocks is\n$$\n\\frac{300{,}000}{10{,}000}=30.\n$$\nTherefore, the allocation problem is equivalent to counting the number of non-negative integer solutions to\n$$\nx_1+x_2+x_3+x_4+x_5+x_6=30.\n$$\nBy the stars-and-bars theorem, the number of solutions in non-negative integers to $x_1+\\dots+x_k=n$ is\n$$\n\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}.\n$$\nHere $n=30$ and $k=6$, so the number of allocation strategies is\n$$\n\\binom{30+6-1}{6-1}=\\binom{35}{5}.\n$$\nEvaluating,\n$$\n\\binom{35}{5}=\\frac{35!}{5!\\,30!}=\\frac{35\\cdot 34\\cdot 33\\cdot 32\\cdot 31}{5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}=324{,}632.\n$$\nThus, there are $\\binom{35}{5}=324{,}632$ distinct allocation strategies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{324632}$$", "id": "1349443"}, {"introduction": "Real-world problems often come with constraints, and a common requirement is that each category must contain at least one item.
