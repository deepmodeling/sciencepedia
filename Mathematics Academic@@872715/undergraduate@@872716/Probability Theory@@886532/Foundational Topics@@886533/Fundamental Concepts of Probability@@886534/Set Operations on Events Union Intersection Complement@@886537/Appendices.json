This first practice provides a clear, real-world scenario involving an athlete's qualification chances, allowing you to directly apply the inclusion-exclusion principle for the union of two events and the concept of a complementary event [@problem_id:1386301]. It's a perfect exercise for solidifying the foundational rules that govern how probabilities interact.", "problem": "A competitive swimmer is participating in a regional meet to qualify for a national championship. There are two ways for the swimmer to qualify for the championship:\n1.  Win their preliminary heat outright (event $H$).\n2.  Achieve a qualifying time standard (event $T$), regardless of their placement in the heat.\n\nBased on the swimmer's past performance and the strength of the competition, the following probabilities have been estimated:\n- The probability that the swimmer wins the heat is $P(H) = 0.35$.\n- The probability that the swimmer achieves the qualifying time standard is $P(T) = 0.28$.\n- The probability that the swimmer both wins the heat and achieves the qualifying time standard is $P(H \\cap T) = 0.15$.\n\nCalculate the probability that the swimmer fails to qualify for the national championship. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $Q$ be the event that the swimmer qualifies for the national championship. According to the problem description, qualification occurs if the swimmer wins their preliminary heat (event $H$) or achieves a qualifying time standard (event $T$). Therefore, the event of qualifying is the union of events $H$ and $T$, which we can write as $Q = H \\cup T$.\n\nTo find the probability of this union, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for two events:\n$$ P(Q) = P(H \\cup T) = P(H) + P(T) - P(H \\cap T) $$\n\nThe problem provides the following probabilities: $P(H) = 0.35$, $P(T) = 0.28$, and $P(H \\cap T) = 0.15$. We substitute these values into the formula to find the probability of qualifying:\n$$ P(Q) = 0.35 + 0.28 - 0.15 $$\n$$ P(Q) = 0.63 - 0.15 = 0.48 $$\nSo, the probability that the swimmer qualifies is $0.48$.\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the swimmer fails to qualify. This event is the complement of the event of qualifying. Let us denote the event of failing to qualify by $Q^c$. The probability of a complementary event is given by the rule:\n$$ P(Q^c) = 1 - P(Q) $$\n\nSubstituting the calculated value for $P(Q)$, we find the probability of failure:\n$$ P(Q^c) = 1 - 0.48 = 0.52 $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to three significant figures. The number $0.52$ has two significant figures (the '5' and the '2'). To express this value with three significant figures, we must add a trailing zero. Therefore, the answer is $0.520$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.520}$$", "id": "1386301"}, {"introduction": "Real-world problems sometimes require a bit of detective work before you can reach the solution. This exercise challenges you to think about sequential events in a manufacturing process and translate a specific outcome into the language of set theory [@problem_id:1386265]. You will see how the inclusion-exclusion principle for three events can be used not just to find a union, but also to strategically deduce the probability of an intersection that isn't provided upfront.", "problem": "In a manufacturing process for advanced microprocessors, each unit undergoes a rigorous quality assurance protocol. The protocol involves a sequential inspection for three specific types of defects: a crystal lattice imperfection (event $A$), a lithography error (event $B$), and a packaging fault (event $C$). The inspections are always performed in the fixed order: first for $A$, then for $B$, and finally for $C$.\n\nFrom historical data, the probabilities associated with these defects for any given microprocessor are as follows:\n- The probability of a crystal lattice imperfection is $P(A) = 0.16$.\n- The probability of a lithography error is $P(B) = 0.13$.\n- The probability of a packaging fault is $P(C) = 0.11$.\n\nA unit is immediately classified as defective if it is found to have at least one of these three defects. The overall probability that a randomly selected unit is classified as defective is $P(A \\cup B \\cup C) = 0.29$. The probabilities for units having multiple specific defects are also known:\n- The probability of having both a crystal lattice imperfection and a packaging fault is $P(A \\cap C) = 0.035$.\n- The probability of having both a lithography error and a packaging fault is $P(B \\cap C) = 0.025$.\n- The probability of having all three defects is $P(A \\cap B \\cap C) = 0.012$.\n\nA microprocessor is selected at random from the production line for inspection.
