This exercise [@problem_id:1358734] involves finding the distribution of the sum of outcomes from two non-standard dice. By systematically enumerating all possible pairs of outcomes, this problem provides a concrete illustration of the convolution operation for discrete distributions, building intuition for how individual probabilities combine to form the probability of a sum.", "problem": "Two non-standard six-sided dice, Die A and Die B, are used in a game. The faces of Die A are labeled with the numbers $\\{1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 6\\}$. The faces of Die B are labeled with the numbers $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4\\}$. When a die is rolled, each of its six faces has an equal probability of landing up. The two dice are rolled simultaneously, and their outcomes are independent of one another. Let the random variable $S$ be the sum of the numbers showing on the top faces of the two dice after a single roll. Determine the most likely value (or values) of $S$. If there is more than one such value, list them all.", "solution": "Let Die A have face-value multiplicities $m_{A}(1)=2$, $m_{A}(2)=2$, $m_{A}(5)=1$, $m_{A}(6)=1$, and let Die B have multiplicities $m_{B}(0)=1$, $m_{B}(1)=1$, $m_{B}(2)=1$, $m_{B}(3)=2$, $m_{B}(4)=1$. Because each die roll is uniform over its six faces and the dice are independent, each ordered pair of faces is equally likely with probability $\\frac{1}{36}$.
