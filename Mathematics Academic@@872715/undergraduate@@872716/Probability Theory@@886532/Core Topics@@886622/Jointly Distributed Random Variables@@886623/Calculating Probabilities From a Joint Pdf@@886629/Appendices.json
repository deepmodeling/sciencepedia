This first exercise provides a gentle introduction by using a uniform distribution, where the PDF is constant. Your task is to calculate a probability over a parallelogram-shaped domain, which makes the problem a fantastic exercise in defining integration bounds for non-rectangular shapes and reinforces the idea that for uniform distributions, probability is proportional to area [@problem_id:1347160].", "problem": "Let $X$ and $Y$ be continuous random variables with a joint probability density function (PDF) given by\n$$ f(x,y) = \\begin{cases} k  \\text{if } (x,y) \\text{ is in the parallelogram } S \\\\ 0  \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nwhere $S$ is the region in the $xy$-plane enclosed by the vertices $(0,0)$, $(3,0)$, $(5,4)$, and $(2,4)$.

The sensor's operational lifetime, $X$, and its data transmission rate, $Y$, are two critical performance metrics. Due to battery characteristics and environmental factors, the joint behavior of these metrics can be modeled by choosing a point $(X,Y)$ from a uniform distribution over a specific rectangular region.\n\nThe lifetime $X$ (in years) is found to vary uniformly between 0 and 2 years, while the transmission rate $Y$ (in megabits per second) varies uniformly between 0 and 1 megabit per second.
