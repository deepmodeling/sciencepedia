This practice problem [@problem_id:1347643] introduces a powerful technique, sometimes known as the Paley-Zygmund inequality, to find a lower bound for the probability that a non-negative random variable is strictly positive, using only its first two moments. The key insight lies in cleverly relating the variable $X$ to the indicator function of the event $\\{X \\gt 0\\}$.", "problem": "A team of physicists is studying a quantum system where the energy of an emitted particle, represented by the non-negative random variable $X$, can fluctuate. The experimental setup allows for the precise measurement of the first two moments of the energy distribution. Let the mean energy be $E[X] = M_1$ and the mean squared energy be $E[X^2] = M_2$. It is known that the particle is not always at rest, so $M_1 > 0$.\n\nA crucial aspect of the system's stability depends on the particle having non-zero energy. The team needs to establish a guaranteed minimum probability that a particle emission has an energy greater than zero. Without making any other assumptions about the probability distribution of $X$, derive a general, tight lower bound for the probability $P(X > 0)$.\n\nExpress your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $M_1$ and $M_2$.", "solution": "Let $X$ be the non-negative random variable representing the particle's energy. We are given its first and second moments, $E[X] = M_1$ and $E[X^2] = M_2$. We are also given that $M_1 > 0$. Our goal is to find a lower bound for the probability $P(X > 0)$.\n\nFirst, we can express the probability $P(X > 0)$ as the expectation of an indicator random variable. Let $I_{X>0}$ be an indicator variable such that:\n$$\nI_{X>0} = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } X > 0 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } X = 0 \\end{cases}\n$$\nBy the definition of expectation for a discrete random variable, the expected value of $I_{X>0}$ is:\n$$\nE[I_{X>0}] = 1 \\cdot P(I_{X>0} = 1) + 0 \\cdot P(I_{X>0} = 0) = P(X > 0)\n$$\nSo, our goal is to find a lower bound for $E[I_{X>0}]$.\n\nWe will use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for expectations. For any two random variables $Y$ and $Z$, the inequality states:\n$$\n(E[YZ])^2 \\le E[Y^2]E[Z^2]\n$$\n\nTo apply this inequality, we need to choose $Y$ and $Z$ appropriately. A clever choice involves connecting the random variable $X$ to the indicator $I_{X>0}$. Since $X$ is non-negative, we can write the identity $X = X \\cdot I_{X>0}$. This is because if $X>0$, $I_{X>0}=1$ and the identity is $X=X$. If $X=0$, both sides are zero.\n\nNow, let's take the expectation of this identity:\n$$\nE[X] = E[X \\cdot I_{X>0}]\n$$\nThis gives us a relationship between $M_1$ and the product of $X$ and our indicator. We can now apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality by setting $Y = X$ and $Z = I_{X>0}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:\n$$\n(E[X \\cdot I_{X>0}])^2 \\le E[X^2] E[I_{X>0}^2]\n$$\n\nLet's evaluate each term in this inequality.\nThe left-hand side is $(E[X])^2 = M_1^2$.\nThe first term on the right-hand side is $E[X^2] = M_2$.\nThe second term on the right-hand side is $E[I_{X>0}^2]$. Since an indicator variable can only be 0 or 1, its square is equal to itself: $I_{X>0}^2 = I_{X>0}$. Therefore:\n$$\nE[I_{X>0}^2] = E[I_{X>0}] = P(X > 0)\n$$\n\nSubstituting these back into the inequality, we get:\n$$\nM_1^2 \\le M_2 \\cdot P(X > 0)\n$$\n\nSince we are given $M_1 > 0$, this implies that $X$ cannot be the zero random variable, so there must be some probability mass at values greater than zero. This ensures that $E[X^2] = M_2 > 0$ (if $M_2=0$, then $X=0$ almost surely, which would mean $M_1=0$, a contradiction). Thus, we can divide by $M_2$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{M_1^2}{M_2} \\le P(X > 0)\n$$\n\nThis provides the desired lower bound for the probability $P(X > 0)$.
