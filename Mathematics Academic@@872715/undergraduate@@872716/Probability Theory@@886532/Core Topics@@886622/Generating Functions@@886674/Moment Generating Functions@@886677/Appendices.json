The MGF of an exponential random variable with rate $\\lambda$ is given by:\n$$M_{W_1}(t) = E[\\exp(tW_1)] = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda - t} = \\frac{1}{1 - t/\\lambda}$$\nThis MGF is defined for $t  \\lambda$.\n\nThe random variable $W_2$ is the negative of $W_1$, so $W_2 = -W_1$.

We can solve for $A$ and $B$ by substituting convenient values for $t$.\nLet $t = 1/\\beta$:\n$$1 = A(1 + \\beta(1/\\beta)) + B(1 - \\beta(1/\\beta)) = A(1+1) + B(0) = 2A$$\nThis gives $A = 1/2$.\n\nLet $t = -1/\\beta$:\n$$1 = A(1 + \\beta(-1/\\beta)) + B(1 - \\beta(-1/\\beta)) = A(0) + B(1+1) = 2B$$\nThis gives $B = 1/2$.\n\nSo, the partial fraction decomposition of $M_X(t)$ is:\n$$M_X(t) = \\frac{1/2}{1 - \\beta t} + \\frac{1/2}{1 + \\beta t}$$\n\nFinally, we equate the two expressions for $M_X(t)$:\n$$\\frac{p}{1 - t/\\lambda} + \\frac{1-p}{1 + t/\\lambda} = \\frac{1/2}{1 - \\beta t} + \\frac{1/2}{1 + \\beta t}$$\nBy comparing the terms, we can identify the unknown parameters.
