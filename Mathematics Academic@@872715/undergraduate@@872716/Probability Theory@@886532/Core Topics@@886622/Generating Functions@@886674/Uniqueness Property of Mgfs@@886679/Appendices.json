The key is to first identify the probability distribution of $X$ by matching its MGF to that of a known distribution.\n\nThe MGF of a random variable $X$ is given as:\n$$M_X(t) = \\frac{0.3e^t}{1 - 0.7e^t}$$\n\nWe recall the MGF for a geometric distribution. A random variable $Y$ follows a geometric distribution with success probability $p$, written as $Y \\sim \\text{Geometric}(p)$, if its probability mass function (PMF) is $P(Y=k) = (1-p)^{k-1}p$ for $k = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$. The MGF of such a random variable is:\n$$M_Y(t) = E[e^{tY}] = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} e^{tk} P(Y=k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} e^{tk} (1-p)^{k-1}p$$\nLet $q = 1-p$. The sum becomes:\n$$M_Y(t) = p \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} e^{tk} q^{k-1} = \\frac{p}{q} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} (e^t q)^k$$\nThis is a geometric series with first term $e^t q$ and common ratio $e^t q$. The sum converges if $|e^t q|  1$, which is consistent with the condition given in the problem statement. The sum is $\\frac{\\text{first term}}{1 - \\text{ratio}} = \\frac{e^t q}{1 - e^t q}$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the MGF:\n$$M_Y(t) = \\frac{p}{q} \\left( \\frac{e^t q}{1 - e^t q} \\right) = \\frac{pe^t}{1 - qe^t} = \\frac{pe^t}{1 - (1-p)e^t}$$\n\nNow, we compare the given MGF, $M_X(t)$, with the standard form for a geometric distribution:\n$$M_X(t) = \\frac{0.3e^t}{1 - 0.7e^t} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad M_Y(t) = \\frac{pe^t}{1 - (1-p)e^t}$$\nBy the uniqueness property of MGFs, if two MGFs are identical, their corresponding distributions are identical. By comparing the two forms, we can identify the parameter $p$:\n$$p = 0.3$$\nAnd we can verify the other parameter:\n$$1-p = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$$\nThis matches the denominator. Therefore, the random variable $X$ follows a geometric distribution with a success probability of $p=0.3$.\n\nWe need to calculate $P(X  3)$. For a geometric distribution with support on $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$, the probability of requiring more than $k$ trials is the probability of having $k$ failures in the first $k$ trials. The probability of a single failure is $1-p$. Thus:\n$$P(X  k) = (1-p)^k$$\nIn our case, $k=3$ and $p=0.3$.\n$$P(X  3) = (1 - 0.3)^3 = (0.7)^3$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$P(X  3) = 0.7 \\times 0.7 \\times 0.7 = 0.49 \\times 0.7 = 0.343$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
