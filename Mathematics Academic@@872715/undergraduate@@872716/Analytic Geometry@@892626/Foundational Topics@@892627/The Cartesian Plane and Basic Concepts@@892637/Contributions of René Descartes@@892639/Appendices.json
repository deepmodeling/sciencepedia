By representing geometric figures with algebraic equations, we can analyze their properties and relationships through symbolic manipulation. A foundational task in this domain is to determine the intersection points of geometric shapes by solving their corresponding system of equations. The number of real solutions to the system—whether zero, one, or multiple—directly informs the geometric arrangement, such as whether the shapes are separate, tangent, or intersecting.\n\nConsider a circle in the Cartesian plane described by the equation $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h,k)$ is the center and $r > 0$ is the radius.
