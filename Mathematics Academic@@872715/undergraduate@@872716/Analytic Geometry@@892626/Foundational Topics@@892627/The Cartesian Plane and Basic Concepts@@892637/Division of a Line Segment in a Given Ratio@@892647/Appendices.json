The drone's journey is planned as a straight-line flight path on a 2D Cartesian grid, where the units are in kilometers. The drone departs from a distribution center located at point $A = (-4, 13)$ and flies to the research station at point $B = (11, -5)$. To save energy and serve intermediate locations, mission planners have decided to establish two new automated drop-off depots, $P_1$ and $P_2$, along the flight path. These depots must divide the total flight path from $A$ to $B$ into three segments of equal length.\n\nDetermine the coordinates of the two new depots, $P_1$ and $P_2$. Assume $P_1$ is the depot closer to the distribution center $A$.\n\nYour final answer should be a set of four numerical values, representing the coordinates of the two depots. Present them in the order: the x-coordinate of $P_1$, the y-coordinate of $P_1$, the x-coordinate of $P_2$, and the y-coordinate of $P_2$.", "solution": "The problem requires us to find the coordinates of two points, $P_1$ and $P_2$, that divide the line segment with endpoints $A(-4, 13)$ and $B(11, -5)$ into three equal parts. The point $P_1$ is stated to be closer to $A$. This implies that the points are ordered along the line as $A, P_1, P_2, B$, and that the lengths of the sub-segments are equal: $|AP_1| = |P_1P_2| = |P_2B|$.\n\nWe can find the coordinates of these points using the section formula. The section formula gives the coordinates $(x, y)$ of a point that divides the line segment joining points $(x_a, y_a)$ and $(x_b, y_b)$ in the ratio $m:n$. The formula is:\n$$x = \\frac{mx_b + nx_a}{m+n}$$\n$$y = \\frac{my_b + ny_a}{m+n}$$\n\nFirst, we find the coordinates of $P_1(x_1, y_1)$. The point $P_1$ is one-third of the way from $A$ to $B$. This means the length of the segment $AP_1$ is one part, and the length of the segment $P_1B$ is two parts. Thus, $P_1$ divides the segment $AB$ in the ratio $m:n = 1:2$.\nWe have $(x_a, y_a) = A(-4, 13)$ and $(x_b, y_b) = B(11, -5)$. With $m=1$ and $n=2$, we apply the section formula:\n$$x_1 = \\frac{1(11) + 2(-4)}{1+2} = \\frac{11 - 8}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1$$\n$$y_1 = \\frac{1(-5) + 2(13)}{1+2} = \\frac{-5 + 26}{3} = \\frac{21}{3} = 7$$\nThe coordinates of depot $P_1$ are $(1, 7)$.\n\nNext, we find the coordinates of $P_2(x_2, y_2)$. The point $P_2$ is two-thirds of the way from $A$ to $B$. This means the length of the segment $AP_2$ is two parts, and the length of the segment $P_2B$ is one part. Thus, $P_2$ divides the segment $AB$ in the ratio $m:n = 2:1$.\nUsing the same endpoints $A$ and $B$, but with $m=2$ and $n=1$, we apply the section formula again:\n$$x_2 = \\frac{2(11) + 1(-4)}{2+1} = \\frac{22 - 4}{3} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6$$\n$$y_2 = \\frac{2(-5) + 1(13)}{2+1} = \\frac{-10 + 13}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1$$\nThe coordinates of depot $P_2$ are $(6, 1)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the answer as a set of four numbers in the order: x-coordinate of $P_1$, y-coordinate of $P_1$, x-coordinate of $P_2$, and y-coordinate of $P_2$.\nThe values are $x_1 = 1$, $y_1 = 7$, $x_2 = 6$, and $y_2 = 1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1  7  6  1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2122225"}, {"introduction": "True understanding of a mathematical tool comes from the ability to use it flexibly.
