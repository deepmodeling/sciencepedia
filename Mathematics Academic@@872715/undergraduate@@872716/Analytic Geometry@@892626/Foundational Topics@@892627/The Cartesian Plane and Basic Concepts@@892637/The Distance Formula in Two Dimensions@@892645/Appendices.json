Scalene and not a right triangle", "solution": "To classify the triangle formed by the vertices P$(-2, -3)$, Q$(2, 0)$, and R$(5, -4)$, we need to determine the lengths of its three sides. We will use the distance formula, which states that the distance $d$ between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. For easier comparison, we can first calculate the square of the lengths of the sides.\n\nFirst, let's find the square of the length of the side PQ.\nThe coordinates are P$(-2, -3)$ and Q$(2, 0)$.\n$PQ^2 = (2 - (-2))^2 + (0 - (-3))^2$\n$PQ^2 = (2 + 2)^2 + (0 + 3)^2$\n$PQ^2 = 4^2 + 3^2$\n$PQ^2 = 16 + 9 = 25$\nThe length of side PQ is $\\sqrt{25} = 5$.\n\nNext, let's find the square of the length of the side QR.\nThe coordinates are Q$(2, 0)$ and R$(5, -4)$.\n$QR^2 = (5 - 2)^2 + (-4 - 0)^2$\n$QR^2 = 3^2 + (-4)^2$\n$QR^2 = 9 + 16 = 25$\nThe length of side QR is $\\sqrt{25} = 5$.\n\nFinally, let's find the square of the length of the side PR.\nThe coordinates are P$(-2, -3)$ and R$(5, -4)$.\n$PR^2 = (5 - (-2))^2 + (-4 - (-3))^2$\n$PR^2 = (5 + 2)^2 + (-4 + 3)^2$\n$PR^2 = 7^2 + (-1)^2$\n$PR^2 = 49 + 1 = 50$\nThe length of side PR is $\\sqrt{50} = \\sqrt{25 \\times 2} = 5\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow we analyze these lengths to classify the triangle. The side lengths are $5$, $5$, and $5\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSince two sides, PQ and QR, have the same length (5 units), the triangle is isosceles. This eliminates options C (Scalene right triangle) and E (Scalene and not a right triangle). Also, since the third side has a different length ($5\\sqrt{2} \\neq 5$), the triangle is not equilateral. This eliminates option A.\n\nThe remaining options are B (Isosceles right triangle) and D (Isosceles but not a right triangle). To distinguish between these, we must check if the triangle satisfies the Pythagorean theorem. The converse of the Pythagorean theorem states that if the square of the longest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, then the triangle is a right triangle.\n\nThe side lengths are $PQ=5$, $QR=5$, and $PR=5\\sqrt{2}$. The longest side is PR.\nWe check if $PQ^2 + QR^2 = PR^2$.\n$25 + 25 = 50$\n$50 = 50$\nSince the equality holds, the triangle is a right triangle. The right angle is at vertex Q, which is opposite the longest side (the hypotenuse) PR.\n\nBecause the triangle is both isosceles and a right triangle, the most specific and accurate classification is an \"Isosceles right triangle\".
