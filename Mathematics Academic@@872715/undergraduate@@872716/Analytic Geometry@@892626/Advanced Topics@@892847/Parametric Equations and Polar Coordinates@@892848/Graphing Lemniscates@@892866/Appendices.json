The point $(1, \\sqrt{3})$ is in the first quadrant.\n$$\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{1}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians}$$\nSo, one possible polar representation of the point $P$ is $(r, \\theta) = (2, \\frac{\\pi}{3})$.\n\nNow, we substitute these polar coordinates into the equation of the curve, $r^2 = 8 \\cos(2\\theta)$, to check for consistency.\nThe left-hand side (LHS) of the equation is:\n$$LHS = r^2 = 2^2 = 4$$\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) of the equation is:\n$$RHS = 8 \\cos(2\\theta) = 8 \\cos\\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = 8 \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)$$\nWe know the value of $\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)$ is $-\\frac{1}{2}$.\n$$RHS = 8 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -4$$\n\nComparing the two sides, we have LHS = $4$ and RHS = $-4$. Since $4 \\neq -4$, the point $P$ does not satisfy the equation.\n\nA point in the plane can have multiple polar coordinate representations. The general forms are $(r, \\theta + 2n\\pi)$ and $(-r, \\theta + (2n+1)\\pi)$ for any integer $n$.\nLet's check the alternative representation for $P$ with a negative radius. Using the principal angle $\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{3}$, a representation with negative $r$ would be $(-2, \\frac{\\pi}{3}+\\pi) = (-2, \\frac{4\\pi}{3})$.\nLet's test this in the equation $r^2 = 8 \\cos(2\\theta)$.\nLHS = $r^2 = (-2)^2 = 4$.\nRHS = $8 \\cos(2\\theta) = 8 \\cos(2 \\cdot \\frac{4\\pi}{3}) = 8 \\cos(\\frac{8\\pi}{3})$.\nSince $\\cos(x)$ has a period of $2\\pi$, we have $\\cos(\\frac{8\\pi}{3}) = \\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{3} + 2\\pi) = \\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}) = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\nRHS = $8 \\cdot (-\\frac{1}{2}) = -4$.\nAgain, LHS $\\neq$ RHS. Therefore, no standard polar representation of the point $P$ satisfies the equation. The point $P$ does not lie on the curve. This eliminates option A.\n\nOption D is incorrect because we have successfully determined the relationship.\n\nLet's evaluate option C. \"The point $P$ would lie on the curve if its radial distance were doubled.\"\nThe original point $P$ has a radial distance $r=2$. Doubling this would mean $r=4$. The Cartesian coordinates would change, but the question is about the point $P$ itself. A more charitable interpretation is: what if a *new* point $P'$ had coordinates $(r, \\theta) = (4, \\pi/3)$?\nLHS = $r^2 = 4^2 = 16$.\nRHS = $8 \\cos(2\\theta) = 8 \\cos(2\\pi/3) = -4$.\nLHS $\\neq$ RHS.
