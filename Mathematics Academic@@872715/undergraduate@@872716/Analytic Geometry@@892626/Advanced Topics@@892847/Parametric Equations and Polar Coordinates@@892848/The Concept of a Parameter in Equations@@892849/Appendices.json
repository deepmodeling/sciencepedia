In this first practice, we explore a family of parabolas whose shapes are governed by a single parameter $k$.

As the parameter $k$ is varied, the vertex of the parabola traces a path. This path, known as the locus of the vertex, forms a straight line that can be expressed in the slope-intercept form $y = mx + c$. Determine the value of the product $mc$.", "solution": "Consider the family of parabolas given by $y = kx^{2} - 4x + 1$ with $k \\neq 0$. The vertex occurs at the extremum of the quadratic, found by setting the derivative with respect to $x$ to zero.

This problem [@problem_id:2163356] presents a dynamic geometric scenario: two lines, anchored at fixed points, that must always remain perpendicular. Your task is to find the locus of their intersection point, which you can model by introducing a parameter like the slope. This practice highlights how a simple geometric rule can generate a well-defined and elegant shape.", "problem": "Let there be two fixed points on a Cartesian plane, $P_{1}$ at coordinates $(a, 0)$ and $P_{2}$ at coordinates $(-a, 0)$, where $a$ is a positive real constant. A variable line $L_{1}$ passes through $P_{1}$, and a second variable line $L_{2}$ passes through $P_{2}$. The two lines $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ are constrained to always be perpendicular to each other. As the lines rotate while maintaining this perpendicular relationship, their intersection point $I$ traces a path. Determine the standard Cartesian equation for the locus of this intersection point $I$.", "solution": "Let the intersection point be $I(x,y)$. The direction vector of line $L_{1}$, which passes through $P_{1}(a,0)$ and $I(x,y)$, is $(x-a,\\,y)$. The direction vector of line $L_{2}$, which passes through $P_{2}(-a,0)$ and $I(x,y)$, is $(x+a,\\,y)$. \n\nBecause $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ are perpendicular, their direction vectors are perpendicular. The necessary and sufficient condition for perpendicularity of two vectors is that their dot product is zero. Therefore,\n$$(x-a,\\,y)\\cdot(x+a,\\,y)=0.$$\nComputing the dot product gives\n$$(x-a)(x+a)+y^{2}=0.$$\nExpanding and simplifying yields\n$$x^{2}-a^{2}+y^{2}=0 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}.$$\n\nThus, the locus of the intersection point $I$ is the circle centered at the origin with radius $a$. Conversely, any point $(x,y)$ on the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}$ satisfies $(x-a,\\,y)\\cdot(x+a,\\,y)=0$, ensuring the existence of perpendicular lines through $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ meeting at $(x,y)$.
