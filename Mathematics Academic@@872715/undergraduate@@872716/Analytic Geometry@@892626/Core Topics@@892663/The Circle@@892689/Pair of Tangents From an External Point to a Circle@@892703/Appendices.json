The square of the length of the tangent, $L^2$, from a point $(x_0, y_0)$ to a circle with the general equation $x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0$ is given by substituting the coordinates of the point into the expression on the left-hand side of the circle's equation.\nThat is, $L^2 = x_0^2 + y_0^2 + 2gx_0 + 2fy_0 + c$.\n\nThe given point is $P(x_0, y_0) = (3.5, 5.2)$.\n\nThe first circle, $C_1$, has the equation $x^2 + y^2 - 4x + 6y - 12 = 0$.\nThe square of the length of the tangent from $P$ to $C_1$, denoted $L_1^2$, can be calculated by substituting the coordinates of $P$ into this equation:\n$L_1^2 = (3.5)^2 + (5.2)^2 - 4(3.5) + 6(5.2) - 12$\n\nLet's compute the individual terms:\n$(3.5)^2 = 12.25$\n$(5.2)^2 = 27.04$\n$4(3.5) = 14$\n$6(5.2) = 31.2$\n\nSubstituting these values back into the expression for $L_1^2$:\n$L_1^2 = 12.25 + 27.04 - 14 + 31.2 - 12$\n$L_1^2 = 39.29 - 14 + 31.2 - 12$\n$L_1^2 = 25.29 + 31.2 - 12$\n$L_1^2 = 56.49 - 12$\n$L_1^2 = 44.49$\n\nThe second circle, $C_2$, has the equation $x^2 + y^2 + 8x - 2y + 1 = 0$.\nThe square of the length of the tangent from $P$ to $C_2$, denoted $L_2^2$, is found by substituting the coordinates of $P$ into this equation:\n$L_2^2 = (3.5)^2 + (5.2)^2 + 8(3.5) - 2(5.2) + 1$\n\nWe already have $(3.5)^2 = 12.25$ and $(5.2)^2 = 27.04$.

The first four significant figures are 1, 0, 2, 3.
