Often, we are given a parabola's path not in a tidy standard form, but as a general equation. By learning to rearrange this equation and complete the square, you can uncover its essential properties: the vertex, focus, and directrix, which are critical for applications like orbital mechanics. [@problem_id:2169582]", "problem": "In a simplified two-dimensional model used for planning a spacecraft's gravitational assist maneuver, the trajectory of a probe relative to a planet is described by a parabola. For this model to be effective, the planet must be precisely located at the focus of this parabolic path. Furthermore, a critical safety protocol requires that the probe's path does not intersect a linear \"forbidden zone\" boundary, which corresponds to the directrix of the parabola.\n\nAn orbital mechanics team has determined that a particular probe's trajectory in a specific Cartesian coordinate system $(x,y)$ is governed by the equation:\n$$y^2 + 8x - 6y + 25 = 0$$\nThe units of distance in this coordinate system are in millions of kilometers.\n\nTo finalize the mission plan, you must determine the key parameters of this trajectory. The coordinates of the planet (focus) are denoted by $(x_f, y_f)$, and the linear boundary of the forbidden zone (directrix) is a vertical line with the equation $x = d$. Determine the numerical values of $x_f$, $y_f$, and $d$.", "solution": "The goal is to find the coordinates of the focus $(x_f, y_f)$ and the equation of the directrix $x=d$ for the parabola described by the given equation. To do this, we must first convert the given equation into the standard form of a parabola.\n\nThe given equation is:\n$$y^2 + 8x - 6y + 25 = 0$$\n\nSince the equation contains a $y^2$ term and a linear $x$ term, we know it represents a parabola that opens either to the left or to the right. The standard form for such a parabola is $(y-k)^2 = 4p(x-h)$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex and $p$ is the directed distance from the vertex to the focus.\n\nOur first step is to rearrange the given equation by grouping the terms involving $y$ on one side and moving the terms involving $x$ and the constant to the other side.\n$$y^2 - 6y = -8x - 25$$\n\nNext, we complete the square for the terms on the left side. To do this, we take half of the coefficient of the $y$ term, which is $-6$, and square it. Half of $-6$ is $-3$, and $(-3)^2 = 9$. We add this value to both sides of the equation to maintain equality.\n$$y^2 - 6y + 9 = -8x - 25 + 9$$\n\nNow, we can factor the left side, which is a perfect square trinomial, and simplify the right side.\n$$(y - 3)^2 = -8x - 16$$\n\nTo match the standard form $(y-k)^2 = 4p(x-h)$, we need to factor out the coefficient of $x$ on the right-hand side. The coefficient of $x$ is $-8$.\n$$(y - 3)^2 = -8(x + 2)$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$(y - 3)^2 = -8(x - (-2))$$\n\nBy comparing this equation with the standard form $(y-k)^2 = 4p(x-h)$, we can identify the parameters of the parabola:\n- The vertex is $(h,k) = (-2, 3)$.\n- The focal length parameter is given by $4p = -8$, which implies $p = -2$.\n\nSince the parabola is of the form $(y-k)^2 = 4p(x-h)$, its axis of symmetry is horizontal. Because $p = -2$ is negative, the parabola opens to the left.\n\nThe focus of a horizontal parabola is located at a distance of $|p|$ from the vertex along the axis of symmetry. The coordinates of the focus are given by $(h+p, k)$.\nSubstituting the values of $h$, $k$, and $p$:\nFocus $(x_f, y_f) = (-2 + (-2), 3) = (-4, 3)$.\nTherefore, we have $x_f = -4$ and $y_f = 3$.\n\nThe directrix of a horizontal parabola is a vertical line given by the equation $x = h - p$.\nSubstituting the values of $h$ and $p$:\nDirectrix equation: $x = -2 - (-2) = -2 + 2 = 0$.\nSo, the equation of the directrix is $x = 0$.\n\nThe problem states that the directrix equation is of the form $x=d$. By comparing this with our result, we find that $d=0$.\n\nThus, the required values are $x_f = -4$, $y_f = 3$, and $d = 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -4 & 3 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2169582"}, {"introduction": "The very definition of a parabola is based on a relationship of distances; every point on the curve is equally far from the focus and the directrix.
