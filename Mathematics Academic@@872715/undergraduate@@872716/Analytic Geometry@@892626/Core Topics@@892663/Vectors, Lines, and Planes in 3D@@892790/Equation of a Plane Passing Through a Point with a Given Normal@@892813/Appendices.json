To find this, we need to identify the normal vector to the plane, $\\vec{n}$, and a point on the plane, let's call it $P_0$. The equation of the plane is given by the dot product relation $\\vec{n} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{p}_0) = 0$, where $\\vec{r} = \\langle x, y, z \\rangle$ is the position vector of any point on the plane and $\\vec{p}_0$ is the position vector of the known point $P_0$.

The problem states that the normal vector to the plane is the position vector of point A, $\\vec{OA}$. The coordinates of point A are $(4, -2, 6)$. The position vector from the origin $O$ to point A is therefore:\n$$\n\\vec{n} = \\vec{OA} = \\langle 4, -2, 6 \\rangle\n$$\nSo, we have $n_x = 4$, $n_y = -2$, and $n_z = 6$.\n\nNext, we need to find the point $P_0$ that lies on the plane. The problem states that the plane passes through the midpoint of the line segment $\\overline{AB}$. Let's call this midpoint $P_0$.
