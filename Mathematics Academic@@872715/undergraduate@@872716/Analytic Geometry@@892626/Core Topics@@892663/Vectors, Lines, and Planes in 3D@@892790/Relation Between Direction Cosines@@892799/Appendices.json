The orientation of any line in three-dimensional space is not arbitrary; its direction cosines—$l = \\cos(\\alpha)$, $m = \\cos(\\beta)$, and $n = \\cos(\\gamma)$—are bound by the fundamental identity $l^2 + m^2 + n^2 = 1$.

The orientation of the antenna is described relative to the probe's local coordinate system, which consists of three mutually orthogonal axes: a positive x-axis along the probe's primary direction of travel, a positive y-axis pointing towards the probe's solar panels, and a positive z-axis along the probe's main body structure.\n\nFor a specific communication maneuver, mission control determines that the vector pointing from the probe's antenna to Earth must make an angle of $60^\\circ$ with the positive x-axis and an angle of $45^\\circ$ with the positive y-axis. To complete the alignment, the probe's control system needs to know the angle that this vector makes with the positive z-axis.
