For the signal to travel from $A$ to $B$ via the reflection point $P$ in the shortest possible time, it must follow the path of minimum total length. Determine the coordinates $(x, y, z)$ of the point $P$ on the reflective surface.

The point of reflection on the $xy$-plane is denoted by $P = (x, y, 0)$. The objective is to minimize the total path length $L$, which is the sum of the distance from $A$ to $P$ and the distance from $P$ to $B$:\n$$L = d(A, P) + d(P, B)$$\nThis problem can be elegantly solved using a geometric method based on reflection. The key insight is that for any point $P$ on the plane of reflection, the distance from $P$ to $B$ is identical to the distance from $P$ to the reflection of $B$ across that plane. Let us define $B'$ as the reflection of point $B$ across the $xy$-plane.\n\nThe reflection of a generic point $(x, y, z)$ across the $xy$-plane is the point $(x, y, -z)$. Applying this to point $B=(7, 10, 5)$, its reflection is $B'=(7, 10, -5)$.\n\nWith this reflection, the total path length can be expressed as:\n$$L = d(A, P) + d(P, B')$$\nThe shortest distance between two fixed points, in this case $A$ and $B'$, is a straight line. Therefore, the length $L$ is minimized when the point $P$ lies on the straight line segment connecting $A$ and $B'$. Our problem is now reduced to finding the intersection of the line passing through $A$ and $B'$ with the $xy$-plane.\n\nWe can represent the line passing through $A(1, 2, 3)$ and $B'(7, 10, -5)$ using a parametric equation. First, we find the direction vector $\\vec{v}$ of the line:\n$$\\vec{v} = \\vec{B'} - \\vec{A} = (7-1, 10-2, -5-3) = (6, 8, -8)$$\nThe parametric equation of the line, $\\vec{r}(t)$, starting from point $A$ is given by:\n$$\\vec{r}(t) = \\vec{A} + t\\vec{v}$$\nIn component form, this is:\n$$x(t) = 1 + 6t$$\n$$y(t) = 2 + 8t$$\n$$z(t) = 3 - 8t$$\nThe point of reflection $P$ is on the $xy$-plane, which means its $z$-coordinate is zero.
