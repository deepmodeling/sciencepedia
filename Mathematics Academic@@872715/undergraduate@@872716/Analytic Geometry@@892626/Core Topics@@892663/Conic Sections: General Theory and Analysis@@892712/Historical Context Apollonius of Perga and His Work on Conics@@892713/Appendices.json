A double cone has its vertex at the origin and its axis aligned with the $z$-axis. The constant angle between the $z$-axis and any generator line of the cone is $\\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ is an acute angle in $(0, \\pi/2)$ radians. The equation of this cone is given by:\n$$x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \\tan^2(\\alpha)$$\nThis cone is intersected by a plane.

To describe this curve in two dimensions, we define a new coordinate system $(x', y')$ that lies within the plane. The new $y'$ coordinate is simply the original $y$ coordinate, i.e., $y' = y$. The new $x'$ coordinate measures the distance along the line of intersection between the cutting plane and the $xz$-plane, with $x'=0$ corresponding to the point where this line crosses the $yz$-plane (i.e., at $x=0, z=c$).

A point-like sensor is to be placed on the major axis at a specific location $P$ with coordinates $(h, 0)$, where $h = \\frac{a^2 - b^2}{2a}$. The engineer needs to find the minimum and maximum possible straight-line distances from the sensor at $P$ to any point on the elliptical boundary of the chamber.\n\nUsing only algebraic methods and the principles of analytic geometry (calculus is not permitted), determine the expressions for the minimum distance, $d_{\\text{min}}$, and the maximum distance, $d_{\\text{max}}$, from the point $P$ to the ellipse. Present your answer as the pair of analytic expressions $(d_{\\text{min}}, d_{\\text{max}})$ in terms of the semi-major axis $a$ and the semi-minor axis $b$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum and maximum distances from a point $P(h, 0)$ on the major axis of an ellipse to the ellipse itself, where $h = \\frac{a^2 - b^2}{2a}$. Let a general point on the ellipse be $Q(x, y)$. The squared distance between $P$ and $Q$ is $d^2 = (x-h)^2 + y^2$.\n\nA fundamental principle from geometry states that the line segment $PQ$ corresponding to an extremal distance (a local minimum or maximum) must be normal to the curve at point $Q$. The only exceptions are the endpoints of the interval of interest, which in this case are the vertices of the ellipse lying on the major axis.\n\nFirst, we consider the distances to the vertices of the ellipse on the major axis, which are $V_1(a, 0)$ and $V_2(-a, 0)$. These are always candidates for the extremal distances.\nThe distance to $V_1$ is $d_1 = \\sqrt{(a-h)^2 + (0-0)^2} = |a-h|$. Since $a  b  0$, we have $a^2 - b^2  0$, so $h = \\frac{a^2 - b^2}{2a}  0$. Also, $a - h = a - \\frac{a^2-b^2}{2a} = \\frac{2a^2-a^2+b^2}{2a} = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{2a}  0$. Thus, $h  a$. So, $d_1 = a-h$.\nSubstituting the expression for $h$:\n$d_1 = a - \\frac{a^2 - b^2}{2a} = \\frac{2a^2 - (a^2 - b^2)}{2a} = \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}$.\n\nThe distance to $V_2$ is $d_2 = \\sqrt{(-a-h)^2 + (0-0)^2} = |-a-h| = a+h$.\nSubstituting the expression for $h$:\n$d_2 = a + \\frac{a^2 - b^2}{2a} = \\frac{2a^2 + a^2 - b^2}{2a} = \\frac{3a^2 - b^2}{2a}$.\n\nNext, we find other points $Q(x_0, y_0)$ on the ellipse where the normal line passes through $P(h, 0)$. The equation of the tangent line to the ellipse at $Q(x_0, y_0)$ is given by $\\frac{x x_0}{a^2} + \\frac{y y_0}{b^2} = 1$.\nFor a point with $y_0 \\neq 0$, the slope of the tangent line is $m_t = -\\frac{b^2 x_0}{a^2 y_0}$.\nThe normal line is perpendicular to the tangent, so its slope is $m_n = -\\frac{1}{m_t} = \\frac{a^2 y_0}{b^2 x_0}$.\n\nThe line segment $PQ$ is this normal line. The slope of the segment connecting $P(h, 0)$ and $Q(x_0, y_0)$ can also be calculated as $m_{PQ} = \\frac{y_0 - 0}{x_0 - h} = \\frac{y_0}{x_0 - h}$.\nEquating the two expressions for the slope of the normal line:\n$\\frac{a^2 y_0}{b^2 x_0} = \\frac{y_0}{x_0 - h}$.\nSince we are looking for points not on the major axis, we assume $y_0 \\neq 0$ and can divide by it:\n$\\frac{a^2}{b^2 x_0} = \\frac{1}{x_0 - h}$\n$a^2(x_0 - h) = b^2 x_0$\n$a^2 x_0 - a^2 h = b^2 x_0$\n$x_0(a^2 - b^2) = a^2 h$.\nThis gives the x-coordinate of the point(s) $Q$:\n$x_0 = \\frac{a^2 h}{a^2 - b^2}$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given value of $h = \\frac{a^2 - b^2}{2a}$:\n$x_0 = \\frac{a^2}{a^2 - b^2} \\left(\\frac{a^2 - b^2}{2a}\\right) = \\frac{a}{2}$.\n\nSince $Q(x_0, y_0)$ lies on the ellipse, its coordinates must satisfy the ellipse equation:\n$\\frac{x_0^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y_0^2}{b^2} = 1$.\nSubstituting $x_0 = a/2$:\n$\\frac{(a/2)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y_0^2}{b^2} = 1 \\implies \\frac{a^2/4}{a^2} + \\frac{y_0^2}{b^2} = 1 \\implies \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{y_0^2}{b^2} = 1$.\n$\\frac{y_0^2}{b^2} = \\frac{3}{4} \\implies y_0^2 = \\frac{3b^2}{4}$.\nSo, there are two such points: $Q_{\\pm}(a/2, \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}b)$.\n\nNow we calculate the distance, $d_3$, from $P$ to these points. We compute the squared distance $d_3^2$:\n$d_3^2 = (x_0 - h)^2 + y_0^2$.\nLet's find the term $(x_0-h)$:\n$x_0 - h = \\frac{a}{2} - \\frac{a^2 - b^2}{2a} = \\frac{a^2 - (a^2 - b^2)}{2a} = \\frac{b^2}{2a}$.\nSubstituting this and $y_0^2$ into the distance formula:\n$d_3^2 = \\left(\\frac{b^2}{2a}\\right)^2 + \\frac{3b^2}{4} = \\frac{b^4}{4a^2} + \\frac{3b^2}{4} = \\frac{b^4 + 3a^2b^2}{4a^2}$.\nSo, the distance is $d_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{b^2(b^2 + 3a^2)}{4a^2}} = \\frac{b\\sqrt{3a^2 + b^2}}{2a}$.\n\nWe now have three candidate distances: $d_1 = \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}$, $d_2 = \\frac{3a^2 - b^2}{2a}$, and $d_3 = \\frac{b\\sqrt{3a^2 + b^2}}{2a}$. To find the minimum and maximum, we compare their squares:\n$d_1^2 = \\left(\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{a^4 + 2a^2b^2 + b^4}{4a^2}$.\n$d_2^2 = \\left(\\frac{3a^2 - b^2}{2a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9a^4 - 6a^2b^2 + b^4}{4a^2}$.\n$d_3^2 = \\frac{3a^2b^2 + b^4}{4a^2}$.\n\nCompare $d_1^2$ and $d_3^2$:\n$d_1^2 - d_3^2 = \\frac{(a^4 + 2a^2b^2 + b^4) - (3a^2b^2 + b^4)}{4a^2} = \\frac{a^4 - a^2b^2}{4a^2} = \\frac{a^2(a^2 - b^2)}{4a^2} = \\frac{a^2 - b^2}{4}$.\nSince $a  b$, $a^2 - b^2  0$, so $d_1^2  d_3^2$. This implies $d_1  d_3$.\n\nCompare $d_1$ and $d_2$:\n$d_2 - d_1 = \\frac{3a^2 - b^2}{2a} - \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a} = \\frac{2a^2 - 2b^2}{2a} = \\frac{a^2 - b^2}{a}$.\nSince $a  b$, this difference is positive, so $d_2  d_1$.\n\nFrom these comparisons, we have the ordering $d_2  d_1  d_3$.\nTherefore, the minimum distance is $d_{\\text{min}} = d_3$ and the maximum distance is $d_{\\text{max}} = d_2$.\n\n$d_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{b\\sqrt{3a^2 + b^2}}{2a}$\n$d_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{3a^2 - b^2}{2a}$\n\nThe required pair of expressions is $(d_{\\text{min}}, d_{\\text{max}})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{b\\sqrt{3a^2 + b^2}}{2a}, \\frac{3a^2 - b^2}{2a}\\right)}$$", "id": "2136209"}]}
