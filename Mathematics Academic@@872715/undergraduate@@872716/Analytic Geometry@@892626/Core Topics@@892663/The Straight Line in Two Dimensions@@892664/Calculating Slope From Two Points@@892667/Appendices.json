This exercise provides a practical scenario where you must find a missing coordinate to ensure three points are collinear, reinforcing the principle that the slope between any two points on a straight line is constant. It's a direct and tangible application of the slope formula to a problem of physical alignment [@problem_id:2111454].", "problem": "In an optics laboratory, a researcher is aligning components on a two-dimensional Cartesian grid. A laser source is located at point $A = (-3, 5)$, and a target sensor is at point $B = (9, -4)$. To correctly channel the beam, a small, passive focusing crystal must be placed at a point $C$ that is perfectly collinear with points $A$ and $B$. The x-coordinate for the crystal's placement is determined to be $x_C = 1$. Determine the corresponding y-coordinate, denoted by $k$, for the point $C = (1, k)$. The coordinates are treated as dimensionless quantities.", "solution": "To ensure collinearity of points $A=(-3,5)$, $B=(9,-4)$, and $C=(1,k)$, point $C$ must lie on the line through $A$ and $B$. The slope of the line through $A$ and $B$ is computed using the slope formula:\n$$\nm=\\frac{y_{B}-y_{A}}{x_{B}-x_{A}}=\\frac{-4-5}{9-(-3)}=\\frac{-9}{12}=-\\frac{3}{4}.\n$$\nUsing the point-slope form of a line with point $A$,\n$$\ny-5=-\\frac{3}{4}\\left(x-(-3)\\right)=-\\frac{3}{4}(x+3).\n$$\nSubstituting $x=1$ to find the corresponding $y$-coordinate,\n$$\ny-5=-\\frac{3}{4}(1+3)=-\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot 4=-3,\n$$\nwhich yields\n$$\ny=2.\n$$\nTherefore, the required $k$ is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2111454"}, {"introduction": "We can extend the concept of slope from straight lines to understand the behavior of curves. This problem asks for the slope of a secant line—a line that intersects a curve at two points—passing through two distinct points on a parabola [@problem_id:2111450].
