While the reflective property typically redirects a ray from one focus towards the other, what happens in the special case where a reflected ray returns directly to its source?

The hyperbola has two foci, one of which is located at $F_1 = (-c, 0)$ where $c > 0$. According to the reflective property of a hyperbola, a ray of light originating from one focus will reflect off the mirror along a path that appears to have originated from the other focus.\n\nConsider a special case where a light ray is emitted from the focus $F_1$. Find the coordinates of the point $P=(x_0, y_0)$ on the branch of the hyperbola with positive $x$-coordinates, such that the ray, upon striking the hyperbola at point $P$, reflects directly back along its incident path towards $F_1$. Provide the coordinates of this point $P$ as an ordered pair $(x_0, y_0)$.", "solution": "The problem asks for a point $P$ on a specific hyperbola such that a ray from one focus, $F_1$, reflects off the hyperbola at $P$ and travels back to $F_1$.\n\nFirst, let's establish the parameters and geometry of the hyperbola. The equation is given by $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, with $a = 8$ and $b = 6$. So the equation is $\\frac{x^2}{64} - \\frac{y^2}{36} = 1$.\n\nThe foci of a hyperbola with its transverse axis on the x-axis are located at $(\\pm c, 0)$, where $c$ is the focal distance. The relationship between $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$.\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$c^2 = 8^2 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 = 100$$\n$$c = \\sqrt{100} = 10$$\nThe foci are therefore located at $F_1 = (-10, 0)$ and $F_2 = (10, 0)$.\n\nThe reflective property of the hyperbola states that a ray of light originating from one focus, say $F_1$, and striking the hyperbola at a point $P$, will reflect along the line that passes through the other focus, $F_2$, and the point $P$. The reflected ray travels away from $F_2$.\n\nThe problem specifies a unique condition: the ray originating from $F_1$ must reflect at $P$ and travel directly back to $F_1$. This means the path of the reflected ray must be the line segment $PF_1$.\n\nBased on the reflective property, the reflected ray's path is the line $\\overleftrightarrow{F_2P}$. For the reflected ray to travel back to $F_1$, the line $\\overleftrightarrow{F_2P}$ must be the same as the line $\\overleftrightarrow{F_1P}$. This can only occur if the three points $F_1$, $F_2$, and $P$ are collinear.\n\nThe line that passes through the two foci, $F_1(-10, 0)$ and $F_2(10, 0)$, is the transverse axis of the hyperbola. In this case, the transverse axis is the x-axis, which is described by the equation $y=0$.\n\nTherefore, the point $P$ must be one of the intersection points of the hyperbola and its transverse axis. These intersection points are the vertices of the hyperbola. To find their coordinates, we set $y=0$ in the hyperbola's equation:\n$$\\frac{x^2}{64} - \\frac{0^2}{36} = 1$$\n$$\\frac{x^2}{64} = 1$$\n$$x^2 = 64$$\n$$x = \\pm \\sqrt{64} = \\pm 8$$\n\nSo, the two points on the hyperbola that are collinear with the foci are the vertices, $V_1 = (-8, 0)$ and $V_2 = (8, 0)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the point $P=(x_0, y_0)$ on the branch of the hyperbola with positive $x$-coordinates. Comparing the two possible points, $V_1$ has a negative x-coordinate and $V_2$ has a positive x-coordinate. Thus, the required point is $P = V_2 = (8, 0)$.\n\nLet's verify this. A ray leaves $F_1(-10, 0)$ and travels to $P(8, 0)$. The incident path is along the x-axis. At $P(8,0)$, the tangent to the hyperbola is a vertical line. The normal to the hyperbola at this vertex is the x-axis itself. Since the incident ray lies along the normal, it reflects back along the normal, i.e., back towards $F_1(-10, 0)$. This is consistent with the general principle of reflection where a ray striking a surface along its normal reflects back upon itself. The geometry aligns with the reflective property, as the line extending from $F_2(10,0)$ through $P(8,0)$ is the negative x-axis, which is indeed the direction of reflection.\n\nThe coordinates of the point $P$ are $(8, 0)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 8 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2154537"}, {"introduction": "Having examined a special case, we now move to a more general application of the hyperbola's reflective property.

Its shape is described by the right branch ($x > 0$) of the hyperbola with the equation $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive real constants representing geometric parameters of the mirror.

The light ray originates from the focus $(c, 0)$. After reflecting at $P$, it will travel along the line passing through $P$ and the other focus $(-c, 0)$.
