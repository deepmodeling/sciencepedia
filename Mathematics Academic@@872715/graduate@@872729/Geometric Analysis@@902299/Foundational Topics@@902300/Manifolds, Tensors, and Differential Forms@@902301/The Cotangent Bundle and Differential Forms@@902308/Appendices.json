The coordinate $1$-forms $dx^{i}$ are, by definition, the exterior derivatives of these functions, $dx^{i} = d(x^{i})$. The pullback of a differential form by a smooth map is defined to commute with the exterior derivative. That is, for a smooth function $f$, the pullback of its exterior derivative $df$ is given by $\\tau^{*}(df) = d(f \\circ \\tau)$. The function $f \\circ \\tau$ is the pullback of the function $f$, denoted $\\tau^*f$. Thus, we have the fundamental relation $\\tau^{*}(d(x^{i})) = d(\\tau^{*}(x^{i})) = d(x^{i} \\circ \\tau)$.\n\nThe compositions $x^{i} \\circ \\tau$ are precisely the component functions of the map $\\tau$ given in the problem statement. Let us denote $\\tilde{x}^{i}(y) = x^{i}(\\tau(y))$. The exterior derivative of a function $f$ in the $y$-coordinates is given by the formula $df = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y^{j}} dy^{j}$. We apply this to each function $\\tilde{x}^{i}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivatives of each component function.

The coordinate $1$-forms $\\{dy^{j}\\}$ and coordinate vector fields $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{k}}\\}$ form dual bases.

Note that $\\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{k}}$ is shorthand for $\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{x}^{i}}{\\partial y^{k}} = \\frac{\\partial(x^i \\circ \\tau)}{\\partial y^k}$.\n\nSecond equality: $dx^{i}\\!\\left(d\\tau\\!\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{k}}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{k}}$\nThe differential (or pushforward) of the map $\\tau$, denoted $d\\tau$, maps tangent vectors in the domain of $\\tau$ to tangent vectors in its codomain. By the chain rule, a coordinate basis vector $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{k}}$ is mapped to:\n$$\nd\\tau\\!\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{k}}\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial(\\tau^{j})}{\\partial y^{k}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}} = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial x^{j}}{\\partial y^{k}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}\n$$\nNow we apply the $1$-form $dx^{i}$ to this resulting vector. Using the duality $dx^{i}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}\\right) = \\delta^{i}_{j}$:\n$$\ndx^{i}\\!\\left(d\\tau\\!\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{k}}\\right)\\right) = dx^{i}\\!\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial x^{j}}{\\partial y^{k}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial x^{j}}{\\partial y^{k}} dx^{i}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial x^{j}}{\\partial y^{k}} \\delta^{i}_{j} = \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{k}}\n$$\nThis establishes the second equality. This calculation also serves as a verification of the foundational definition of the pullback of a $1$-form $\\omega$, which is $(\\tau^{*}\\omega)(v) = \\omega(d\\tau(v))$. Here, we have shown this explicitly for $\\omega = dx^i$ and $v = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}$.\n\nConclusion: The matrix of $\\tau^{*}$ is the transpose of the Jacobian matrix of $\\tau$.\nThe linear map $\\tau^{*}$ transforms covectors from the basis $\\{dx^{1}, dx^{2}, dx^{3}\\}$ to the basis $\\{dy^{1}, dy^{2}, dy^{3}\\}$. From Task 1, we have the transformation rule for the basis covectors:\n$$\n\\tau^{*}(dx^{i}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{j}} dy^{j}\n$$\nLet a covector $\\alpha$ be represented in the $x$-coordinates as $\\alpha = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_{i} dx^{i}$. Its pullback $\\tau^{*}\\alpha$ is:\n$$\n\\tau^{*}\\alpha = \\tau^{*}\\!\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_{i} dx^{i}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_{i} \\tau^{*}(dx^{i}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_{i} \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{j}} dy^{j}\\right)\n$$\nRearranging the summation, we express $\\tau^{*}\\alpha$ in the $y$-coordinate basis:\n$$\n\\tau^{*}\\alpha = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_{i} \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{j}}\\right) dy^{j} = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} b_{j} dy^{j}\n$$\nThe components $b_j$ of the pulled-back covector are given by $b_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{j}} a_{i}$.\nThe Jacobian matrix of $\\tau$ is $J(\\tau)$ with entries $(J(\\tau))_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{j}}$. The transpose Jacobian, $J(\\tau)^T$, has entries $(J(\\tau)^T)_{ji} = (J(\\tau))_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{j}}$.\nSo, the relationship between the components can be written as $b_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (J(\\tau)^T)_{ji} a_{i}$.\nIn matrix-vector notation, if $[a]$ is the column vector of components $(a_1, a_2, a_3)^T$ and $[b]$ is the column vector of components $(b_1, b_2, b_3)^T$, then $[b] = J(\\tau)^T [a]$.\nThe matrix that transforms the coordinate vector of a covector is the matrix of the linear transformation. Therefore, the matrix of $\\tau^{*}$ with respect to the bases $\\{dx^i\\}$ and $\\{dy^j\\}$ is $J(\\tau)^T$, the transpose of the Jacobian matrix of $\\tau$.\n\n### Task 3: Evaluation of a Coefficient\n\nWe need to find the value of the coefficient of $dy^{2}$ in the $1$-form $\\tau^{*}(dx^{3})$ at the point $y_{0} = (2,-1,0)$.\nFrom Task 1, the expression for $\\tau^{*}(dx^{3})$ is:\n$$\n\\tau^{*}(dx^{3}) = y^{2} dy^{1} + y^{1} dy^{2} + \\frac{2y^{3}}{1+(y^{3})^{2}} dy^{3}\n$$\nThe coefficient of the $1$-form $dy^{2}$ is the function $f(y) = y^{1}$.\nWe are asked to evaluate this coefficient at the point $y_{0} = (y_{0}^{1}, y_{0}^{2}, y_{0}^{3}) = (2, -1, 0)$.\nSubstituting the coordinates of $y_{0}$ into the coefficient function, we get:\n$$\nf(y_0) = y_{0}^{1} = 2\n$$\nThe value of the coefficient is $2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "3034691"}, {"introduction": "The generalized Stokes' Theorem, $\\int_S d\\omega = \\int_{\\partial S} \\omega$, is a cornerstone of analysis on manifolds, unifying the classical integral theorems of vector calculus.

Conclude with a closed-form expression for the dimension of the space of harmonic $k$-forms under absolute boundary conditions, and likewise under relative boundary conditions, as a function of the form degree $k$ and ambient dimension $n$.\n\nGive your final answer as a two-entry row matrix $ \\left( \\dim \\mathcal{H}^{k}_{\\mathrm{abs}}(A_{a,b}), \\, \\dim \\mathcal{H}^{k}_{\\mathrm{rel}}(A_{a,b}) \\right) $, written as a single analytic expression in terms of $k$ and $n$. No numerical rounding is required. No units are involved.", "solution": "The problem asks for the dimensions of the spaces of harmonic $k$-forms on a spherical annulus $A_{a,b} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ subject to absolute and relative boundary conditions. A differential form $\\omega$ is harmonic if it is in the kernel of the Hodge Laplacian, $\\Delta\\omega = 0$. On a compact manifold an equivalent condition is that the form is both closed ($d\\omega=0$) and co-closed ($\\delta\\omega=0$). We will seek solutions satisfying these two first-order equations.\n\nWe use spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, where $r=|x| \\in (a,b)$ and $\\theta \\in S^{n-1}$. The Euclidean metric is $ds^2 = dr^2 + r^2 g_{S^{n-1}}$, where $g_{S^{n-1}}$ is the standard metric on the unit sphere. Any $k$-form $\\omega$ on $A_{a,b}$ can be decomposed into a tangential part and a normal part:\n$$ \\omega = \\alpha(r,\\theta) + dr \\wedge \\beta(r,\\theta) $$\nwhere for each fixed $r$, $\\alpha(r,\\theta)$ is a $k$-form on the sphere $S_r^{n-1}$ and $\\beta(r,\\theta)$ is a $(k-1)$-form on $S_r^{n-1}$. The outward unit normal vector field $\\nu$ on $\\partial A_{a,b}$ corresponds to $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$ at $r=b$ and $-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$ at $r=a$. For our purposes, we can analyze the components with respect to the coordinate vector field $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$. The interior contraction $\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}}$ and the tangential projection give:\n$$ \\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}}\\omega = \\beta \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\omega^{\\top} = \\alpha $$\nThe boundary conditions simplify to:\n- Absolute BCs: $\\beta\\big|_{\\partial A} = 0$ and $\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}}(d\\omega)\\big|_{\\partial A} = 0$.\n- Relative BCs: $\\alpha\\big|_{\\partial A} = 0$ and $\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}}(\\delta\\omega)\\big|_{\\partial A} = 0$.\n\nLet $d_S$ and $\\delta_S$ be the exterior derivative and codifferential on $(S^{n-1}, g_{S^{n-1}})$. The exterior derivative on $A_{a,b}$ is $d = dr \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} + d_S$. Applied to $\\omega$:\n$$ d\\omega = d_S\\alpha + dr \\wedge \\frac{\\partial\\alpha}{\\partial r} - dr \\wedge d_S\\beta = d_S\\alpha + dr \\wedge \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\alpha}{\\partial r} - d_S\\beta\\right) $$\nThe codifferential $\\delta$ can also be expressed in terms of radial and spherical parts. The conditions for $\\omega$ to be harmonic ($d\\omega=0, \\delta\\omega=0$) become a system of partial differential equations for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. We solve this by separation of variables, expanding $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in a basis of eigenforms of the spherical Laplacian $\\Delta_S = d_S\\delta_S+\\delta_S d_S$.\n\nThe space of harmonic forms is known to be isomorphic to specific cohomology groups of the manifold. For a compact oriented manifold $M$ with boundary $\\partial M$:\n$$ \\mathcal{H}^k_{\\mathrm{abs}}(M) \\cong H^k(M) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathcal{H}^k_{\\mathrm{rel}}(M) \\cong H^k(M, \\partial M) $$\nThe annulus $A_{a,b}$ is homotopy equivalent to the sphere $S^{n-1}$. The cohomology of $S^{n-1}$ is well-known:\n$$ \\dim H^k(S^{n-1}) = \\delta_{k,0} + \\delta_{k,n-1} \\quad \\text{for } n \\ge 2 $$\nUsing the Lefschetz duality $H^k(M, \\partial M) \\cong H_{n-k}(M)$ (homology) and the Hurewicz theorem relating homology and homotopy, we have $H_p(A_{a,b}) \\cong H_p(S^{n-1})$. The homology groups of the sphere are $\\dim H_p(S^{n-1}) = \\delta_{p,0} + \\delta_{p,n-1}$.\nThus,\n$$ \\dim \\mathcal{H}^k_{\\mathrm{abs}}(A_{a,b}) = \\dim H^k(A_{a,b}) = \\dim H^k(S^{n-1}) = \\delta_{k,0} + \\delta_{k,n-1} $$\n$$ \\dim \\mathcal{H}^k_{\\mathrm{rel}}(A_{a,b}) = \\dim H^k(A_{a,b}, \\partial A_{a,b}) \\cong \\dim H_{n-k}(A_{a,b}) = \\dim H_{n-k}(S^{n-1}) = \\delta_{n-k,0} + \\delta_{n-k,n-1} = \\delta_{k,n} + \\delta_{k,1} $$\nWhile these formulas provide the answer, the problem requires construction from first principles. We will construct explicit non-trivial harmonic forms for the degrees where the dimension is non-zero.\n\n**1. Absolute Boundary Conditions: $\\dim \\mathcal{H}^k_{\\mathrm{abs}} = \\delta_{k,0} + \\delta_{k,n-1}$**\n\n- **Case $k=0$**: $\\omega=f$ is a function. $\\Delta f = 0$. In spherical coordinates, separating variables $f(r,\\theta)=R(r)Y_l(\\theta)$ where $\\Delta_S Y_l = -l(l+n-2)Y_l$ leads to the radial equation $r^2R'' + (n-1)rR' - l(l+n-2)R = 0$. The solutions are $R_l(r) = c_1 r^l + c_2 r^{-l-n+2}$ for $l0$, and $R_0(r)=c_1+c_2r^{2-n}$ (for $n2$) or $R_0(r)=c_1+c_2\\ln r$ (for $n=2$).\nAbsolute BCs for a $0$-form are $\\iota_\\nu f = 0$ (trivial) and $\\iota_\\nu df = 0$. With $\\nu \\propto \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$, this means $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r}\\big|_{\\partial A} = 0$.\nFor $l0$, $R_l'(a)=0$ and $R_l'(b)=0$ leads to a linear system for $c_1, c_2$ with a non-zero determinant, so $c_1=c_2=0$. No solutions for $l0$.\nFor $l=0$, $R_0'(r) = -c_2(n-2)r^{1-n}$ (or $c_2/r$ for $n=2$). $R_0'(a)=R_0'(b)=0$ implies $c_2=0$.\nSo $R_0(r)=c_1$. The only solutions are constant functions, $f(x)=C$. The space of $l=0$ spherical harmonics is one-dimensional.\nThus, $\\dim \\mathcal{H}^0_{\\mathrm{abs}} = 1$. This corresponds to the $k=0$ term in the formula.\n\n- **Case $k=n-1$**: We search for a non-trivial harmonic $(n-1)$-form. Consider a form that is \"radially constant\" and purely tangential, built from a harmonic form on $S^{n-1}$. Harmonic forms on $S^{n-1}$ exist only in degrees $0$ and $n-1$. Let $\\sigma$ be the volume form of the unit sphere $S^{n-1}$. We can pull it back to $A_{a,b}$ via the radial projection map $\\pi:A_{a,b} \\to S^{n-1}$, $\\pi(x)=x/|x|$.\nLet $\\omega = \\pi^*\\sigma$. This form is purely tangential, so $\\beta=0$ in the decomposition $\\omega=\\alpha+dr\\wedge\\beta$. The first absolute BC, $\\beta=0$, is satisfied.\nSince $\\sigma$ is a top-degree form on $S^{n-1}$, it is closed: $d_S\\sigma=0$.\n$d\\omega = d(\\pi^*\\sigma) = \\pi^*(d_S\\sigma) = 0$. The second absolute BC, $\\iota_\\nu d\\omega=0$, is also satisfied.\nWe must check if $\\omega$ is co-closed. Indeed, $\\omega$ is the standard angular form, which is harmonic on $\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Explicitly, $\\omega = r^{1-n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^{i-1} x_i dx^1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\widehat{dx^i} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^n$. We have $\\star\\omega = c r^{2-n} dr$ (up to a constant $c$), and $d(\\star\\omega)=0$. Thus $\\delta\\omega=0$.\nSo, $\\omega = C \\cdot \\pi^*\\sigma$ gives a family of harmonic forms. This space is one-dimensional.\nThus, $\\dim \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}_{\\mathrm{abs}}=1$. This corresponds to the $k=n-1$ term.\n\n- **Other degrees $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-2\\}$**: For these degrees, there are no harmonic forms on $S^{n-1}$. Solutions must have non-trivial radial dependence and arise from non-harmonic spherical modes. A full analysis of the ODE system shows that the boundary conditions force the solutions to be trivial. A simpler argument is that any form in $\\mathcal{H}^k_{\\mathrm{abs}}(A_{a,b})$ represents a class in $H^k(A_{a,b}) \\cong H^k(S^{n-1})$, which is trivial for these $k$. This implies any such closed form $\\omega$ is exact, $\\omega=d\\gamma$. The harmonic condition $\\delta\\omega=0$ and the boundary conditions impose an elliptic problem on $\\gamma$ which admits only a trivial solution. Thus, $\\dim \\mathcal{H}^k_{\\mathrm{abs}}=0$ for $1 \\le k \\le n-2$.\n\n**2. Relative Boundary Conditions: $\\dim \\mathcal{H}^k_{\\mathrm{rel}} = \\delta_{k,1} + \\delta_{k,n}$**\n\n- **Case $k=n$**: An $n$-form is $\\omega = f(x) dV_{\\mathbb{R}^n}$. The harmonic condition $\\Delta\\omega=0$ implies $f$ must be a harmonic function. Using the separation of variables from $k=0$, $f(r,\\theta) = R_l(r)Y_l(\\theta)$.\nRelative BCs for an $n$-form are $\\omega^\\top=0$ and $\\iota_\\nu\\delta\\omega=0$. The first, $\\omega^\\top=0$, is automatically satisfied as an $n$-form evaluates to zero on any set of $n$ vectors tangent to an $(n-1)$-dimensional boundary.\nFor the second condition, if $\\omega$ is harmonic, $\\delta\\omega=0$, so it is also satisfied.\nSo any harmonic function $f$ gives a harmonic $n$-form $\\omega=f dV$ satisfying relative BCs.\nWe need to find such harmonic functions on $A_{a,b}$. On a flat space, $\\Delta(f dV) = (\\Delta_{scalar} f) dV$. So $f$ must be a harmonic function.\nLet's reconsider. An $n$-form is $\\omega = g(r, \\theta) dr \\wedge dV_{S_r^{n-1}} = g(r, \\theta) r^{-(n-1)} dV_{\\mathbb{R}^n}$.\nHarmonic condition $\\Delta\\omega=0$ is equivalent to $d\\omega=0$ (automatic for $n$-forms) and $\\delta\\omega=0$. $\\delta\\omega = \\star d \\star \\omega$ (up to sign). Let $\\omega = f dV$. $\\star\\omega=f$. $\\delta\\omega=\\pm \\star df$. $\\delta\\omega=0 \\iff df=0 \\iff f$ is constant.\nSo harmonic $n$-forms are constant multiples of the volume form, $\\omega = C dV_{\\mathbb{R}^n}$. As argued, these satisfy the relative BCs. The space is one-dimensional.\nThus, $\\dim\\mathcal{H}^n_{\\mathrm{rel}} = 1$. This matches the $k=n$ term.\n\n- **Case $k=1$**: Consider radial 1-forms $\\omega = g(r)dr$.\n$d\\omega = d(g(r)dr) = g'(r)dr\\wedge dr = 0$.\nTo check the co-closed condition $\\delta\\omega=0$, we compute $\\star\\omega = \\star(g(r)dr) = g(r) r^{n-1} \\operatorname{vol}_{S^{n-1}}$. Then $d(\\star\\omega)=0$ requires that $g(r)r^{n-1}$ is constant with respect to $r$. So $g(r)r^{n-1}=C$, which means $g(r)=Cr^{1-n}$.\nThus $\\omega = C r^{1-n} dr$ is a harmonic 1-form for any $n \\ge 2$.\nFor $n=2$, $\\omega = C\\frac{dr}{r} = d(C\\ln r)$. For $n2$, $\\omega=d(\\frac{C}{2-n}r^{2-n})$. So $\\omega$ is exact, $\\omega = d\\phi$ for a radial harmonic function $\\phi$.\nLet's check the relative BCs. $\\omega = g(r)dr$. In the decomposition $\\omega=\\alpha+dr\\wedge\\beta$, we have $\\alpha=0$ and $\\beta=0$. The form must be written as $\\omega = f(r,\\theta) dr + \\omega_T$. Here $\\omega_T=0$, so the tangential component is zero. $\\omega^\\top = 0$ is satisfied.\nSince $\\omega$ is harmonic, $\\delta\\omega=0$, so $\\iota_\\nu\\delta\\omega=0$ is also satisfied.\nThus, $\\omega = C r^{1-n}dr$ is a one-dimensional space of harmonic 1-forms with relative BCs.\nSo $\\dim\\mathcal{H}^1_{\\mathrm{rel}} = 1$. This matches the $k=1$ term.\n\n- **Case $k=0$: $\\omega=f$.** Relative BCs are $f|_{\\partial A}=0$ (Dirichlet condition). The only harmonic function on $A_{a,b}$ vanishing on the boundary is $f=0$. So $\\dim\\mathcal{H}^0_{\\mathrm{rel}}=0$.\n- **Other degrees $k \\in \\{2, \\dots, n-1\\}$**: Much as with the absolute case, the cohomology $H^k(A_{a,b}, \\partial A_{a,b})$ is trivial for these degrees, which implies the spaces of harmonic forms are trivial. No non-trivial solutions to the radial ODEs can satisfy the boundary conditions. So $\\dim\\mathcal{H}^k_{\\mathrm{rel}}=0$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe dimensions of the spaces of harmonic $k$-forms on the annulus $A_{a,b} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ under absolute and relative boundary conditions are given by the Betti numbers of $S^{n-1}$ and its relative homology, respectively. The analysis using separation of variables and explicit construction of representative forms confirms these results.\n\nThe dimension of the space of harmonic $k$-forms with absolute boundary conditions is:\n$$ \\dim \\mathcal{H}^{k}_{\\mathrm{abs}}(A_{a,b}) = \\delta_{k,0} + \\delta_{k,n-1} $$\nThe dimension of the space of harmonic $k$-forms with relative boundary conditions is:\n$$ \\dim \\mathcal{H}^{k}_{\\mathrm{rel}}(A_{a,b}) = \\delta_{k,1} + \\delta_{k,n} $$\nThese expressions are valid for $n\\geq 2$ and $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$. The Kronecker delta $\\delta_{i,j}$ is $1$ if $i=j$ and $0$ otherwise.\nFor example, if $n=3$, the dimensions for absolute BCs are non-zero only for $k=0$ and $k=2$. For relative BCs, they are non-zero only for $k=1$ and $k=3$.\n\nThe final answer is presented as a two-entry row matrix containing these two expressions.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\delta_{k,0} + \\delta_{k,n-1}  \\delta_{k,1} + \\delta_{k,n} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "3034690"}]}
