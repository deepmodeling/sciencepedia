All provided definitions—classical symbols, Weyl quantization, and the Moyal product—are standard and correctly formulated. The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and objective. It is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe task is to determine the principal symbol of the composition of two pseudodifferential operators, $\\operatorname{Op}^{w}(a) \\circ \\operatorname{Op}^{w}(b)$, defined via Weyl quantization. The symbol of the resulting operator, $\\operatorname{Op}^{w}(c)$, is given by the Moyal (or star) product of the individual symbols, $c(x,\\xi) = (a \\star b)(x,\\xi)$. The principal symbol is the term of highest degree of homogeneity in $\\xi$ as $|\\xi| \\to \\infty$ in the asymptotic expansion of $c(x,\\xi)$.\n\nThe Moyal product is defined by the formula:\n$$\nc(x,\\xi) = (a \\star b)(x,\\xi) = \\left[\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{i}{2}\\left(\\partial_{\\xi}\\cdot \\partial_{y} - \\partial_{x}\\cdot \\partial_{\\eta}\\right)\\right) a(x,\\xi)b(y,\\eta)\\right]_{\\substack{y=x\\\\ \\eta=\\xi}}\n$$\nwhere $\\partial_{\\xi}\\cdot \\partial_{y} = \\sum_{k=1}^{d} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\xi_k} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_k}$ and $\\partial_{x}\\cdot \\partial_{\\eta} = \\sum_{k=1}^{d} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\eta_k}$.\n\nTo analyze the asymptotic behavior of $c(x,\\xi)$, we expand the exponential operator into its Taylor series:\n$$\n\\exp(Z) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{Z^k}{k!}\n$$\nwhere $Z = \\frac{i}{2}\\left(\\partial_{\\xi}\\cdot \\partial_{y} - \\partial_{x}\\cdot \\partial_{\\eta}\\right)$. Applying this to the product $a(x,\\xi)b(y,\\eta)$ yields an asymptotic expansion for $c(x,\\xi)$:\n$$\nc(x,\\xi) = a(x,\\xi)b(x,\\xi) + \\frac{i}{2}\\left(\\partial_{\\xi}a \\cdot \\partial_{x}b - \\partial_{x}a \\cdot \\partial_{\\xi}b\\right)(x,\\xi) + \\mathcal{O}(|\\xi|^{m+n-2})\n$$\nThe notation $\\mathcal{O}(|\\xi|^{p})$ indicates terms whose leading homogeneous part is of degree $p$.

The principal symbols are $\\sigma_{\\text{prin}}(a) = a_m(x,\\xi)$ and $\\sigma_{\\text{prin}}(b) = b_n(x,\\xi)$.\n\nLet us analyze the terms of the Moyal product expansion.\n\nTerm $k=0$: This is the simple product $a(x,\\xi)b(x,\\xi)$. Its asymptotic expansion is:\n$$\na(x,\\xi)b(x,\\xi) \\sim \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} a_{m-j}(x,\\xi)\\right) \\left(\\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} b_{n-l}(x,\\xi)\\right) = a_m b_n + (a_m b_{n-1} + a_{m-1} b_n) + \\dots\n$$\nThe leading term is $a_m(x,\\xi)b_n(x,\\xi)$. Since $a_m$ is homogeneous of degree $m$ and $b_n$ is homogeneous of degree $n$, their product $a_m b_n$ is homogeneous of degree $m+n$. The subsequent terms are of lower degrees of homogeneity ($m+n-1$, $m+n-2$, etc.).\n\nTerm $k=1$: This term is proportional to the Poisson bracket:\n$$\n\\frac{i}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{d} \\left( \\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial \\xi_k} \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial x_k} - \\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial x_k} \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial \\xi_k} \\right)(x,\\xi)\n$$\nLet's analyze the symbolic order of the components. Differentiation with respect to $x_k$ preserves the order of a symbol, while differentiation with respect to $\\xi_k$ reduces the order by $1$.\n- $\\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial \\xi_k} \\in S_{\\mathrm{cl}}^{m-1}(\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d})$\n- $\\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial x_k} \\in S_{\\mathrm{cl}}^{n}(\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d})$\nThe product $\\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial \\xi_k} \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial x_k}$ is therefore a symbol in $S_{\\mathrm{cl}}^{m+n-1}(\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d})$. Its principal symbol is $(\\partial_{\\xi_k}a_m)(\\partial_{x_k}b_n)$, which is homogeneous of degree $(m-1)+n = m+n-1$.\nSimilarly, $\\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial x_k} \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial \\xi_k}$ is a symbol in $S_{\\mathrm{cl}}^{m+n-1}$, with principal symbol $(\\partial_{x_k}a_m)(\\partial_{\\xi_k}b_n)$ of homogeneity $m+(n-1) = m+n-1$.\nConsequently, the entire $k=1$ term is a symbol in $S_{\\mathrm{cl}}^{m+n-1}$, and its leading homogeneous contribution is of degree $m+n-1$.\n\nTerm $k \\ge 2$: The term corresponding to a general $k$ in the series expansion involves $k$ applications of the bidifferential operator $\\partial_{\\xi}\\cdot \\partial_{y} - \\partial_{x}\\cdot \\partial_{\\eta}$. Each application involves one derivative with respect to a momentum variable ($\\xi$ or $\\eta$) and one with respect to a position variable ($x$ or $y$). A derivative with respect to a momentum variable lowers the degree of homogeneity in $\\xi$ by $1$.\nWhen we consider the leading contribution from the $k$-th term, we apply the derivatives to the principal symbols $a_m$ and $b_n$. This term involves a total of $k$ momentum-variable derivatives. The resulting expression will be homogeneous of degree $m+n-k$. For example, the principal part of the $k=2$ term is of degree $m+n-2$.\n\nThe symbol $c(x,\\xi)$ for the composite operator thus possesses the following asymptotic expansion:\n$$\nc(x,\\xi) \\sim \\underbrace{a_m(x,\\xi)b_n(x,\\xi)}_{\\text{degree } m+n} + \\underbrace{\\left( a_m b_{n-1} + a_{m-1} b_n + \\frac{i}{2}\\{a_m, b_n\\} \\right)(x,\\xi)}_{\\text{degree } m+n-1} + \\dots\n$$\nThe composite operator $\\operatorname{Op}^{w}(c)$ is a pseudodifferential operator of order $m+n$. Its principal symbol, $\\sigma_{m+n}(c)$, is by definition the leading homogeneous term in the asymptotic expansion of its symbol $c(x,\\xi)$.\nFrom the expansion above, the term of highest degree of homogeneity in $\\xi$ is $a_m(x,\\xi)b_n(x,\\xi)$, which has degree $m+n$. All other terms are of strictly lower degree ($m+n-1$, $m+n-2$, etc.).\n\nTherefore, the principal symbol of the composition $\\operatorname{Op}^{w}(a) \\circ \\operatorname{Op}^{w}(b)$ is the product of the principal symbols of $\\operatorname{Op}^{w}(a)$ and $\\operatorname{Op}^{w}(b)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{a_{m}(x,\\xi)b_{n}(x,\\xi)}\n$$", "id": "3032792"}, {"introduction": "When moving from scalar equations to systems of PDEs, the principal symbol becomes a matrix-valued function, and the concept of ellipticity generalizes to the invertibility of this matrix for all non-zero covectors.

We consider the homogeneous equation $\\Delta u = 0$ in the interior of the domain.\n$$\n(\\Delta_{x'} + \\partial_{t}^{2}) u(x', t) = 0\n$$\nWe apply the Fourier transform in the tangential variables $x' \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$.

We apply this to the same decaying solution $v(t) = c \\exp(-|\\xi'| t)$. First, we compute the derivative with respect to $t$:\n    $$\n    \\partial_{t}v(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( c \\exp(-|\\xi'| t) \\right) = -c|\\xi'|\\exp(-|\\xi'| t)\n    $$\n    Now, we evaluate at the boundary $t=0$:\n    $$\n    \\gamma_{1}v = (\\partial_{t}v)|_{t=0} = -c|\\xi'|\\exp(-|\\xi'| \\cdot 0) = -c|\\xi'|\n    $$\n    The principal boundary symbol for the Neumann condition, $\\sigma_{N}(\\xi')$, is the map that takes $v(0)=c$ to $\\gamma_{1}v = -c|\\xi'|$. This corresponds to multiplication by $-|\\xi'|$.\n    $$\n    \\sigma_{N}(\\xi') = -|\\xi'|\n    $$\n\n**Commentary on the Lopatinskii–Shapiro Condition**:\n\nThe Lopatinskii–Shapiro (or complementing) condition is a crucial criterion for the ellipticity of a boundary value problem. For an elliptic operator $P$ and a boundary operator $B$, the condition requires that for every non-zero tangential covector $\\xi'$, the map\n$$\nv \\in E_{+}(\\xi') \\mapsto (Bv)|_{t=0} \\in \\mathbb{C}^k\n$$\n(where $k$ is the number of boundary conditions) is an isomorphism. In our case, $k=1$, and the space of decaying solutions $E_{+}(\\xi')$ is one-dimensional for $\\xi' \\neq 0$. The map is an isomorphism if and only if it is not the zero map. Using the identification of $E_{+}(\\xi')$ with $\\mathbb{C}$ via evaluation at $t=0$, this condition is equivalent to requiring that the principal boundary symbol, as a linear map from $\\mathbb{C}$ to $\\mathbb{C}$, is invertible. This means the scalar value of the symbol must be non-zero.\n\n-   For the Dirichlet condition, the symbol is $\\sigma_{D}(\\xi')=1$. Since $1 \\neq 0$, the map is always an isomorphism. The Lopatinskii–Shapiro condition is satisfied for all $\\xi' \\neq 0$. Thus, the Dirichlet problem for the Laplacian is an elliptic boundary value problem.\n\n-   For the Neumann condition, the symbol is $\\sigma_{N}(\\xi')=-|\\xi'|$. For any non-zero tangential covector $\\xi' \\neq 0$, we have $|\\xi'| > 0$, and therefore $\\sigma_{N}(\\xi') \\neq 0$. The map is an isomorphism for all $\\xi' \\neq 0$. The Lopatinskii–Shapiro condition is satisfied. Thus, the Neumann problem for the Laplacian is also an elliptic boundary value problem.\n\nThis analysis confirms the well-posedness of these classical boundary value problems from the perspective of modern elliptic theory.\n\nThe final answer, as a two-entry row matrix, combines our results for the Dirichlet and Neumann symbols.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -|\\xi'|\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3032887"}]}
