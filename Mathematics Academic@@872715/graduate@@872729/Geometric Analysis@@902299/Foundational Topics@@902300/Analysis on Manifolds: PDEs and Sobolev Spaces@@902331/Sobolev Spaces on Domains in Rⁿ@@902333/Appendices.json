The problem is a standard, well-posed question in the theory of Sobolev spaces, a central topic in geometric analysis. All terms are defined formally and are mathematically sound. The premises are consistent and self-contained, allowing for a rigorous derivation.\n\nLet $u \\in W^{1,1}_{0}(0,1)$. By the definition provided, we can work with the representative of the equivalence class of $u$ that is an absolutely continuous function on the closed interval $[0,1]$ satisfying $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=0$. For such a function, the fundamental theorem of calculus holds.\n\nFor any $x \\in [0,1]$, we can express $u(x)$ by integrating its derivative $u'$ from the left endpoint:\n$$ u(x) = u(0) + \\int_{0}^{x} u'(t) \\, dt $$\nSince $u(0)=0$, this simplifies to:\n$$ u(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} u'(t) \\, dt $$\nTaking the absolute value and applying the triangle inequality for integrals, we obtain a bound on $|u(x)|$:\n$$ |u(x)| = \\left| \\int_{0}^{x} u'(t) \\, dt \\right| \\le \\int_{0}^{x} |u'(t)| \\, dt $$\nSimilarly, we can express $u(x)$ by integrating from the right endpoint. For any $x \\in [0,1]$:\n$$ u(1) - u(x) = \\int_{x}^{1} u'(t) \\, dt $$\nSince $u(1)=0$, we have:\n$$ -u(x) = \\int_{x}^{1} u'(t) \\, dt \\quad \\implies \\quad u(x) = -\\int_{x}^{1} u'(t) \\, dt $$\nTaking the absolute value yields another bound:\n$$ |u(x)| = \\left| -\\int_{x}^{1} u'(t) \\, dt \\right| = \\left| \\int_{x}^{1} u'(t) \\, dt \\right| \\le \\int_{x}^{1} |u'(t)| \\, dt $$\nSince $u$ is continuous on the compact interval $[0,1]$, its modulus $|u|$ must attain a maximum value at some point $x_0 \\in [0,1]$. Let this maximum value be $\\|u\\|_{L^{\\infty}(0,1)} = |u(x_0)|$. If $u$ is the zero function, the inequality holds trivially for any $C \\ge 0$. Let us assume $u$ is not the zero function. Since $u(0)=u(1)=0$, the point $x_0$ must lie in the open interval $(0,1)$.\n\nAt this point $x_0$, both inequalities derived above must hold:\n$$ \\|u\\|_{L^{\\infty}(0,1)} \\le \\int_{0}^{x_0} |u'(t)| \\, dt $$\n$$ \\|u\\|_{L^{\\infty}(0,1)} \\le \\int_{x_0}^{1} |u'(t)| \\, dt $$\nSumming these two inequalities gives:\n$$ 2 \\|u\\|_{L^{\\infty}(0,1)} \\le \\int_{0}^{x_0} |u'(t)| \\, dt + \\int_{x_0}^{1} |u'(t)| \\, dt $$\nThe sum on the right-hand side is precisely the $L^1$-norm of $u'$ over the domain $(0,1)$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{x_0} |u'(t)| \\, dt + \\int_{x_0}^{1} |u'(t)| \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{1} |u'(t)| \\, dt = \\|u'\\|_{L^{1}(0,1)} $$\nThus, we arrive at the inequality:\n$$ 2 \\|u\\|_{L^{\\infty}(0,1)} \\le \\|u'\\|_{L^{1}(0,1)} $$\n$$ \\|u\\|_{L^{\\infty}(0,1)} \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\|u'\\|_{L^{1}(0,1)} $$\nThis demonstrates that the inequality holds for any $u \\in W^{1,1}_{0}(0,1)$ with a constant $C = 1/2$. Therefore, the optimal constant $C_{\\star}$ must be less than or equal to $1/2$, i.e., $C_{\\star} \\le 1/2$.\n\nTo prove that $C_{\\star} = 1/2$, we must show that no smaller constant will work. This can be done by constructing a specific non-zero function $u \\in W^{1,1}_{0}(0,1)$ for which the ratio $\\|u\\|_{L^{\\infty}} / \\|u'\\|_{L^{1}}$ equals $1/2$. Consider the \"tent\" function centered at $x=1/2$:\n$$ u(x) = \\begin{cases} x  \\text{if } 0 \\le x \\le 1/2 \\\\ 1-x  \\text{if } 1/2  x \\le 1 \\end{cases} $$\nThis function is absolutely continuous, satisfies $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=0$. Its derivative (which exists almost everywhere) is:\n$$ u'(x) = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } 0  x  1/2 \\\\ -1  \\text{if } 1/2  x  1 \\end{cases} $$\nThe derivative $u'$ is in $L^1(0,1)$, so $u \\in W^{1,1}_{0}(0,1)$.\nThe $L^{\\infty}$-norm of $u$ is its maximum value, which is $\\|u\\|_{L^{\\infty}(0,1)} = u(1/2) = 1/2$.\nThe $L^{1}$-norm of $u'$ is:\n$$ \\|u'\\|_{L^{1}(0,1)} = \\int_{0}^{1} |u'(x)| \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1/2} |1| \\, dx + \\int_{1/2}^{1} |-1| \\, dx = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 $$\nFor this function, the inequality becomes $\\|u\\|_{L^{\\infty}} \\le C_{\\star} \\|u'\\|_{L^{1}}$, which is $1/2 \\le C_{\\star} \\cdot 1$. This implies $C_{\\star} \\ge 1/2$.\nCombining our two results, $C_{\\star} \\le 1/2$ and $C_{\\star} \\ge 1/2$, we conclude that the optimal constant is $C_{\\star} = 1/2$.\n\nFinally, we identify the set of all nonzero functions $u \\in W^{1,1}_{0}(0,1)$ for which equality holds, i.e., $\\|u\\|_{L^{\\infty}(0,1)} = (1/2) \\|u'\\|_{L^{1}(0,1)}$. Equality holds if and only if all inequalities used in the derivation are equalities. Let $x_0 \\in (0,1)$ be a point where $|u(x_0)| = \\|u\\|_{L^{\\infty}(0,1)}$. Without loss of generality, let $u(x_0)  0$. The derivation required two steps that must be equalities:\n1. $u(x_0) = \\int_{0}^{x_0} u'(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{x_0} |u'(t)| \\, dt$. This holds if and only if $u'(t) \\ge 0$ for almost every $t \\in (0, x_0)$.\n2. $u(x_0) = -\\int_{x_0}^{1} u'(t) \\, dt = \\int_{x_0}^{1} |u'(t)| \\, dt$. This holds if and only if $-u'(t) \\ge 0$, i.e., $u'(t) \\le 0$, for almost every $t \\in (x_0, 1)$.\n\nFrom these two conditions, we have $\\|u\\|_{L^{\\infty}} = \\int_0^{x_0} |u'| dt$ and $\\|u\\|_{L^{\\infty}} = \\int_{x_0}^1 |u'| dt$. This implies that $\\|u'\\|_{L^1} = \\int_0^{x_0} |u'| dt + \\int_{x_0}^1 |u'| dt = 2 \\|u\\|_{L^{\\infty}}$, confirming the equality.\nThus, the nonzero extremizing functions are precisely those $u \\in W^{1,1}_{0}(0,1)$ for which there exists a point $x_0 \\in (0,1)$ such that $u$ is monotonic (non-decreasing or non-increasing) on the interval $[0, x_0]$ and monotonic in the opposite sense on $[x_0, 1]$.

The factor $M(n,p,q,\\lambda)$ quantifies the change in the Sobolev constant due to a change in the *size* of the domain, governed by the dilation factor $\\lambda$. The base constant $C_{p,q}(\\Omega)$ depends on the *shape* or geometry of the domain $\\Omega$ (normalized to a certain size, e.g., unit volume). For $q = p^{\\ast}$, the constant is independent of size ($M=1$) but still depends on the shape of $\\Omega$. For $q  p^{\\ast}$, the exponent $1 - n(\\frac{1}{p} - \\frac{1}{q})$ is positive, so $C_{p,q}(\\Omega_{\\lambda})$ increases as the domain gets larger ($\\lambda  1$). This means that for a fixed shape, larger domains admit a larger best constant.
