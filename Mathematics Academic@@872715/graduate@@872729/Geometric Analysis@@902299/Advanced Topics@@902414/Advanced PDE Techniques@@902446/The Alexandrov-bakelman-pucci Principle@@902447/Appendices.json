A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nLet $\\Gamma(x) = \\varphi(|x|)$ be a convex function on $\\Omega = B_R(0)$.\nFirst, we analyze the implications of the given properties on the function $\\varphi: [0, R) \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\nFor $\\Gamma$ to be convex, the function $r \\mapsto \\varphi(r)$ must be convex and non-decreasing on $[0, R)$. The non-decreasing property arises because for any $x \\in \\Omega$, $\\Gamma(x) \\ge \\Gamma(0)$, which means $\\varphi(|x|) \\ge \\varphi(0)$. More generally, for $0 \\le r_1  r_2  R$, one can show that $\\varphi(r_1) \\le \\varphi(r_2)$. Since $\\varphi$ is non-decreasing, the supremum of $-\\varphi(r)$ is achieved at the smallest value of $r$, which is $r=0$.\nThus, the amplitude $M$ is given by\n$$ M = \\sup_{r \\in [0,R)} (-\\varphi(r)) = -\\varphi(0) $$\nThis implies $\\varphi(0) = -M$.\nThe boundary condition is $\\Gamma|_{\\partial \\Omega} \\le 0$, which means $\\varphi(R) := \\lim_{r \\to R^-} \\varphi(r) \\le 0$.\n\nThe gradient of $\\Gamma$ at a point $x \\neq 0$ is given by\n$$ \\nabla \\Gamma(x) = \\frac{d}{d|x|} \\varphi(|x|) \\frac{x}{|x|} = \\varphi'(|x|) \\frac{x}{|x|} $$\nwherever $\\varphi$ is differentiable. The magnitude of the gradient is therefore\n$$ |\\nabla \\Gamma(x)| = |\\varphi'(|x|)| $$\nSince $\\varphi$ is non-decreasing and convex, its derivative $\\varphi'(r)$ (where it exists) must be non-negative. Thus, $|\\nabla \\Gamma(x)| = \\varphi'(|x|)$.\nOur goal is to find an upper bound for $\\varphi'(r)$ for $r \\in (0,R)$.\n\nA fundamental property of a convex function $\\varphi$ on an interval $[a,b]$ states that for any $t_1, t_2, t_3$ with $a \\le t_1  t_2  t_3 \\le b$, the slopes of the secant lines are non-decreasing:\n$$ \\frac{\\varphi(t_2) - \\varphi(t_1)}{t_2 - t_1} \\le \\frac{\\varphi(t_3) - \\varphi(t_1)}{t_3 - t_1} \\le \\frac{\\varphi(t_3) - \\varphi(t_2)}{t_3 - t_2} $$\nFurthermore, if $\\varphi$ is differentiable at $t_2$, then\n$$ \\frac{\\varphi(t_2) - \\varphi(t_1)}{t_2 - t_1} \\le \\varphi'(t_2) \\le \\frac{\\varphi(t_3) - \\varphi(t_2)}{t_3 - t_2} $$\nApplying this property to $\\varphi$ on $[0,R]$, let $t_1=0$, $t_2=r \\in (0,R)$, and $t_3=R$. We get two key inequalities.\nFirst, for any $r \\in (0,R)$, the point $(r, \\varphi(r))$ lies below the secant line connecting $(0, \\varphi(0))$ and $(R, \\varphi(R))$:\n$$ \\varphi(r) \\le \\varphi(0) + \\frac{\\varphi(R) - \\varphi(0)}{R} r $$\nSecond, for any $r \\in (0,R)$ where $\\varphi$ is differentiable, its derivative is bounded by the slope of the secant line from $(r,\\varphi(r))$ to $(R,\\varphi(R))$:\n$$ \\varphi'(r) \\le \\frac{\\varphi(R) - \\varphi(r)}{R - r} $$\nWe can combine these two inequalities to find a uniform bound on $\\varphi'(r)$.\nSubstitute the first inequality into the second one:\n$$ \\varphi'(r) \\le \\frac{\\varphi(R) - \\varphi(r)}{R-r} \\le \\frac{\\varphi(R) - \\left( \\varphi(0) + \\frac{\\varphi(R) - \\varphi(0)}{R} r \\right)}{R-r} $$\nLet's simplify the numerator:\n$$ \\varphi(R) - \\varphi(0) - \\frac{r}{R}(\\varphi(R) - \\varphi(0)) = (\\varphi(R) - \\varphi(0)) \\left(1 - \\frac{r}{R}\\right) = (\\varphi(R) - \\varphi(0)) \\frac{R-r}{R} $$\nSubstituting this back into the inequality for $\\varphi'(r)$:\n$$ \\varphi'(r) \\le \\frac{(\\varphi(R) - \\varphi(0)) \\frac{R-r}{R}}{R-r} = \\frac{\\varphi(R) - \\varphi(0)}{R} $$\nThis provides a uniform upper bound for $\\varphi'(r)$ for all $r \\in (0,R)$ where the derivative exists.\nNow, we use the conditions $\\varphi(0) = -M$ and $\\varphi(R) \\le 0$.\n$$ \\varphi'(r) \\le \\frac{\\varphi(R) - (-M)}{R} = \\frac{\\varphi(R) + M}{R} $$\nSince $\\varphi(R) \\le 0$, we have $\\varphi(R) + M \\le M$. Therefore,\n$$ \\varphi'(r) \\le \\frac{M}{R} $$\nThis bound applies to $|\\nabla \\Gamma(x)| = \\varphi'(|x|)$ for any $x \\in \\Omega \\setminus \\{0\\}$ where $\\Gamma$ is differentiable.\n$$ |\\nabla \\Gamma(x)| \\le \\frac{M}{R} $$\nThe problem asks for the constant $C$ in the inequality $|\\nabla \\Gamma(x)| \\le C \\frac{M}{\\operatorname{diam}(\\Omega)}$. Given $\\operatorname{diam}(\\Omega)=2R$, we have $R=\\frac{\\operatorname{diam}(\\Omega)}{2}$. Substituting this into our bound:\n$$ |\\nabla \\Gamma(x)| \\le \\frac{M}{\\frac{\\operatorname{diam}(\\Omega)}{2}} = 2 \\frac{M}{\\operatorname{diam}(\\Omega)} $$\nThis shows that the inequality holds for $C=2$. Therefore, the optimal constant must be less than or equal to $2$.\n\nTo show that $C=2$ is optimal, we must demonstrate that no smaller constant works for all functions in the class. We do this by constructing an example function $\\Gamma$ for which the ratio $\\frac{|\\nabla \\Gamma(x)| \\operatorname{diam}(\\Omega)}{M}$ is exactly $2$.\nConsider the linear function $\\varphi(r) = ar+b$. For the corresponding $\\Gamma(x)=a|x|+b$ to be convex, we need $a \\ge 0$.\nLet's choose $a$ and $b$ to saturate the conditions:\n1. $\\varphi(0) = -M \\implies b = -M$.\n2. $\\varphi(R) = 0$. This is the maximal value allowed by $\\varphi(R) \\le 0$. $aR+b=0 \\implies aR-M=0 \\implies a = \\frac{M}{R}$.\nSince $M0$ and $R0$, we have $a0$, so convexity is satisfied.\nLet's define the function $\\Gamma_0(x)$ via $\\varphi_0(r)$:\n$$ \\varphi_0(r) = \\frac{M}{R}r - M $$\nThis gives $\\Gamma_0(x) = \\frac{M}{R}|x| - M$.\nLet's verify the conditions for this function:\n- $\\Gamma_0$ is convex.\n- $\\Gamma_0(x)$ is radial.\n- $\\sup_{x \\in \\Omega} (-\\Gamma_0(x)) = \\sup_{x \\in \\Omega} (M - \\frac{M}{R}|x|) = M - \\inf_{x \\in \\Omega}(\\frac{M}{R}|x|) = M - 0 = M$.\n- $\\Gamma_0|_{\\partial \\Omega} = \\varphi_0(R) = \\frac{M}{R}R - M = 0$, so $\\Gamma_0|_{\\partial \\Omega} \\le 0$ is satisfied.\n\nFor this function, the derivative of $\\varphi_0$ is $\\varphi_0'(r) = \\frac{M}{R}$ for all $r \\in (0,R)$.\nSo, for any $x \\in \\Omega \\setminus \\{0\\}$,\n$$ |\\nabla \\Gamma_0(x)| = \\varphi_0'(|x|) = \\frac{M}{R} $$\nThe inequality $|\\nabla \\Gamma_0(x)| \\le C \\frac{M}{\\operatorname{diam}(\\Omega)}$ must hold. Let's substitute the values for our specific function:\n$$ \\frac{M}{R} \\le C \\frac{M}{2R} $$\nSince $M0$ and $R0$, we can simplify this to:\n$$ 1 \\le \\frac{C}{2} \\implies C \\ge 2 $$\nWe have shown that for any valid function $\\Gamma$, $C=2$ is a sufficient constant. We have also shown that there exists a valid function $\\Gamma_0$ for which the constant $C$ must be at least $2$.\nTherefore, the optimal (smallest) value for the constant $C$ is exactly $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3034102"}, {"introduction": "The core proof of the ABP principle relies on tools, like the concave envelope, that are naturally defined on convex sets.

The convexity of $\\Omega$ is unnecessary because one can construct the concave envelope entirely within $\\Omega$ without any extension or modification; moreover, the upper contact set automatically splits along a Whitney covering of $\\Omega$ into pairwise disjoint pieces, so the area formula can be applied cube-by-cube without any overlap issues.**\nThis statement is **incorrect**. The definition and essential properties of the concave envelope (e.g., that it is the infimum of all affine functions dominating the function) require a convex domain. It is not possible to \"construct the concave envelope entirely within\" a non-convex $\\Omega$ using the standard machinery. The claim that the upper contact set \"automatically splits\" is vague. The localization procedure must be constructed carefully, often with cutoff functions, and overlap in the covering is a key issue to be managed, not something that is magically absent.\n\n**B. The convexity of $\\Omega$ is necessary; otherwise, supporting hyperplanes to the concave envelope may exit $\\Omega$, which invalidates the area formula for the gradient image and prevents control of the upper contact set.**\nThis statement is **incorrect**. The central claim, \"The convexity of $\\Omega$ is necessary,\" is false. The ABP principle holds for general bounded open sets $\\Omega$. The reasoning provided correctly identifies the *difficulty* of applying the simple proof strategy to a non-convex domain, but it incorrectly concludes that this difficulty makes the entire result invalid. The theorem is true; it is the proof method that must be adapted.\n\n**C. Localization can be achieved by covering $\\Omega$ with convex subsets whose boundaries coincide with $\\partial \\Omega$. One then applies the ABP argument independently on each convex subset, and the resulting supremum bounds combine additively because the supremum is subadditive over disjoint coverings.**\nThis statement is **incorrect**. First, it is generally impossible to partition an arbitrary non-convex domain $\\Omega$ into convex subsets \"whose boundaries coincide with $\\partial \\Omega$.\" For instance, a domain with a smooth, non-convex boundary cannot be tiled by polygons. Second, the logic for combining the bounds is flawed. The supremum over a union is the maximum of the suprema, not an additive combination of bounds.\n\n**D. To avoid nonconvexity, extend $u$ by zero outside $\\Omega$ and take the concave envelope on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. This forces the upper contact set to coincide with all of $\\Omega$, which makes convexity of $\\Omega$ irrelevant and the area formula immediate.**\nThis statement is **incorrect**. Extending $u$ by zero and taking its concave envelope on the convex set $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a valid construction. However, the crucial differential inequality $-\\mathrm{tr}(A D^2 u) \\ge f$ is only satisfied inside $\\Omega$. The claim that this \"forces the upper contact set to coincide with all of $\\Omega$\" is completely unfounded and generally false. The contact set can be a much smaller subset of $\\Omega$.\n\n**E. Convexity of $\\Omega$ is not required because the concave envelope can be constructed on a convex ambient set, such as the convex hull of $\\Omega$ or on convex dilations of Whitney cubes covering the positivity set of $u$.

It accurately describes the standard localization technique used to prove the ABP principle on general bounded domains. The key steps are all present and correctly stated:\n1.  Focus the argument on the region of interest, typically the positivity set $\\{u > 0\\}$.\n2.  Cover this region with a Whitney decomposition $\\{Q\\}$, providing a family of cubes with controlled size and bounded overlap.\n3.

Apply the full power of Alexandrov's theorem and the area formula on each convex set $Q^\\ast$.\n6.  Aggregate the estimates obtained on each piece.
