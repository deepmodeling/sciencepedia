The perimeter $P(E)$ is defined as the total variation of the characteristic function $\\chi_E$ of the set $E$, i.e., $P(E) = |D\\chi_E|(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$.\n\nThe problem directs us to use the slicing method. Let $x = (x', x_n)$ where $x' \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ and $x_n \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

The slice functions are defined as $(\\chi_E)_{x_n}(x') = \\chi_E(x', x_n)$ and $(\\chi_E)_{x'}(x_n) = \\chi_E(x', x_n)$. We will compute each integral separately.\n\nFirst Term: Contribution from horizontal slices.\nThe first integral is $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} |D'(\\chi_E)_{x_n}|(\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}) \\, dx_n$.\nA slice $(\\chi_E)_{x_n}$ for a fixed $x_n \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a function on $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$.\n- If $0  x_n  h$, the slice is $(\\chi_E)_{x_n}(x') = \\chi_{B_{r}^{n-1}}(x')$, the characteristic function of the open ball of radius $r$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$.\n- If $x_n \\leq 0$ or $x_n \\geq h$, the slice is $(\\chi_E)_{x_n}(x') = 0$ for all $x'$, which is the zero function.\n\nThe total variation $|D'(\\chi_E)_{x_n}|(\\mathbb{R}^{n-1})$ is the perimeter of the set defined by the slice in $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$.\n- For $0  x_n  h$, this is the perimeter of the ball $B_{r}^{n-1}$, which we denote as $P(B_{r}^{n-1})$. The perimeter of a ball is the $(n-2)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of its boundary sphere. The formula for the surface area of an $m$-dimensional ball $B_R^m$ (i.e., the measure of the sphere $\\partial B_R^m = S_R^{m-1}$) is $m \\omega_m R^{m-1}$. For the ball $B_{r}^{n-1}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$, we have $m=n-1$ and $R=r$.

The total variation is the sum of the absolute values of these jumps: $|1-0| + |0-1| = 1+1=2$.\n- For $x' \\notin B_{r}^{n-1}$, the function is identically zero, so its total variation is $0$.\n\nSubstituting this into the second integral, we get:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}} |D_n(\\chi_E)_{x'}|(\\mathbb{R}) \\, dx' = \\int_{B_{r}^{n-1}} 2 \\, dx' = 2 \\cdot \\mathcal{L}^{n-1}(B_{r}^{n-1})\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}^{n-1}(B_{r}^{n-1})$ is the $(n-1)$-dimensional Lebesgue measure (volume) of the ball $B_{r}^{n-1}$. The volume of an $m$-dimensional ball $B_R^m$ is given by $\\omega_m R^m$. For the ball $B_{r}^{n-1}$, we have $m=n-1$ and $R=r$. Thus,\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^{n-1}(B_{r}^{n-1}) = \\omega_{n-1}r^{n-1}\n$$\nThe value of the second integral is therefore $2\\omega_{n-1}r^{n-1}$.

We can rearrange it slightly to group common factors:\n$$\nP(E) = \\omega_{n-1} r^{n-2} \\left[ 2r + h(n-1) \\right]\n$$\nHowever, the expanded form shows the contribution from the top/bottom faces and the lateral surface more distinctly.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n#### Part 1: Computation of the Essential Boundary $\\partial^{e} E$\nThe essential boundary (or measure-theoretic boundary) $\\partial^{e} E$ of a Lebesgue measurable set $E \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the set of points where the density of $E$ is strictly between $0$ and $1$. The density of $E$ at a point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, denoted $\\theta^{n}(E, x)$, is defined as the limit:\n$$\n\\theta^{n}(E, x) = \\lim_{\\rho \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{\\mathcal{L}^{n}(E \\cap B_{\\rho}(x))}{\\mathcal{L}^{n}(B_{\\rho}(x))}\n$$\nprovided the limit exists. Here, $\\mathcal{L}^{n}$ is the $n$-dimensional Lebesgue measure and $B_{\\rho}(x)$ is the open ball of radius $\\rho$ centered at $x$. For our problem, $n=3$.\nThe essential boundary is thus given by:\n$$\n\\partial^{e} E = \\left\\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\mid 0  \\theta^{3}(E, x)  1 \\right\\}\n$$\nWe analyze the density $\\theta^{3}(E, x)$ for different locations of the point $x$.\n\n1.  **Point $x$ in the interior of either ball:**\n    Let $x \\in B_{r_{1}}(a)$. There exists a $\\delta  0$ such that $B_{\\delta}(x) \\subset B_{r_{1}}(a)$. Since the two main balls are disjoint, $B_{\\delta}(x) \\subset E$. For any $\\rho \\in (0, \\delta)$, we have $B_{\\rho}(x) \\subset E$, which implies $E \\cap B_{\\rho}(x) = B_{\\rho}(x)$.\n    The density is $\\theta^{3}(E, x) = \\lim_{\\rho \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{\\mathcal{L}^{3}(B_{\\rho}(x))}{\\mathcal{L}^{3}(B_{\\rho}(x))} = 1$.\n    The same reasoning applies if $x \\in B_{r_{2}}(b)$. Thus, for any point in the interior of $E$, the density is $1$. These points are not in $\\partial^{e} E$.\n\n2.  **Point $x$ outside the union of the closed balls:**\n    Let $x \\notin E$, so $x \\notin \\overline{B}_{r_{1}}(a) \\cup \\overline{B}_{r_{2}}(b)$. The complement of $E$, denoted $E^c$, is an open set. Thus, there exists a $\\delta  0$ such that $B_{\\delta}(x) \\subset E^c$, which means $B_{\\delta}(x) \\cap E = \\emptyset$. For any $\\rho \\in (0, \\delta)$, we have $E \\cap B_{\\rho}(x) = \\emptyset$.\n    The density is $\\theta^{3}(E, x) = \\lim_{\\rho \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{\\mathcal{L}^{3}(\\emptyset)}{\\mathcal{L}^{3}(B_{\\rho}(x))} = \\lim_{\\rho \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{0}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\rho^3} = 0$.\n    Thus, for any point outside the closed set $E$, the density is $0$. These points are not in $\\partial^{e} E$.\n\n3.  **Point $x$ on the boundary of either ball:**\n    Let $x \\in \\partial B_{r_{1}}(a)$, which is the sphere of radius $r_{1}$ centered at $a$. The boundary $\\partial B_{r_{1}}(a)$ is a smooth surface ($C^{\\infty}$). For any such point on a smooth boundary, a small ball $B_{\\rho}(x)$ is approximately bisected by the tangent plane to the sphere at $x$. One half of $B_{\\rho}(x)$ lies inside $\\overline{B}_{r_{1}}(a)$ and the other half lies outside. The condition $|a-b|r_1+r_2$ ensures that for sufficiently small $\\rho$, the ball $B_\\rho(x)$ does not intersect $\\overline{B}_{r_2}(b)$. Therefore, $E \\cap B_{\\rho}(x) = \\overline{B}_{r_{1}}(a) \\cap B_{\\rho}(x)$.\n    For a point on a smooth manifold of codimension $1$, the density is a well-known result: $\\theta^{3}(E, x) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n    Since $0  \\frac{1}{2}  1$, all points $x \\in \\partial B_{r_{1}}(a)$ belong to the essential boundary $\\partial^{e} E$.\n    By identical reasoning, for any point $x \\in \\partial B_{r_{2}}(b)$, the density is $\\theta^{3}(E, x) = \\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, all points $x \\in \\partial B_{r_{2}}(b)$ also belong to $\\partial^{e} E$.\n\nCombining these cases, the essential boundary of $E$ is the union of the boundaries of the two balls:\n$$\n\\partial^{e} E = \\partial B_{r_{1}}(a) \\cup \\partial B_{r_{2}}(b)\n$$\nThis is the union of two disjoint spheres.\n\n#### Part 2: Computation of the Perimeter $P(E)$\nA measurable set $E \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a set of finite perimeter if its characteristic function $\\chi_E$ has a finite total variation. The perimeter $P(E)$ is defined as the total variation of the gradient of $\\chi_E$, where the gradient is taken in the sense of distributions:\n$$\nP(E) = \\|\\nabla \\chi_E\\| = \\sup \\left\\{ \\int_{E} \\operatorname{div} \\phi(x) \\, d\\mathcal{L}^{3}(x) : \\phi \\in C_c^1(\\mathbb{R}^3, \\mathbb{R}^3), \\|\\phi\\|_{L^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^3)} \\leq 1 \\right\\}\n$$\nFor a set $E$ with a $C^1$ boundary $\\partial E$, one can apply the divergence theorem:\n$$\n\\int_{E} \\operatorname{div} \\phi(x) \\, dx = \\int_{\\partial E} \\phi(x) \\cdot \\nu_E(x) \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(x)\n$$\nwhere $\\nu_E$ is the outward unit normal to $\\partial E$ and $\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}$ is the $(n-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure.\nThe perimeter definition becomes:\n$$\nP(E) = \\sup_{\\|\\phi\\|_{L^\\infty} \\leq 1} \\int_{\\partial E} \\phi(x) \\cdot \\nu_E(x) \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{2}(x)\n$$\nThe supremum is attained by choosing $\\phi(x)$ to be \"as close as possible\" to $\\nu_E(x)$ on $\\partial E$. This leads to the integral of the norm of the normal vector, which is $1$. Thus, the supremum is the surface area of $\\partial E$:\n$$\nP(E) = \\int_{\\partial E} 1 \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{2}(x) = \\mathcal{H}^{2}(\\partial E)\n$$\nA fundamental result in the theory of sets of finite perimeter (De Giorgi's theorem) states that for any set $E$ of finite perimeter, its perimeter is equal to the $(n-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of its essential boundary:\n$$\nP(E) = \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\\partial^e E)\n$$\nIn our case, $n=3$, so $P(E) = \\mathcal{H}^{2}(\\partial^e E)$. From Part 1, we found that $\\partial^e E = \\partial B_{r_{1}}(a) \\cup \\partial B_{r_{2}}(b)$.\nSince the two spheres are disjoint (as $|a-b|  r_{1}+r_{2}$), the measure of their union is the sum of their individual measures:\n$$\nP(E) = \\mathcal{H}^{2}(\\partial B_{r_{1}}(a) \\cup \\partial B_{r_{2}}(b)) = \\mathcal{H}^{2}(\\partial B_{r_{1}}(a)) + \\mathcal{H}^{2}(\\partial B_{r_{2}}(b))\n$$\nIn $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the $2$-dimensional Hausdorff measure $\\mathcal{H}^2$ of a sufficiently regular surface like a sphere is simply its surface area. The surface area of a sphere of radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$.\nTherefore:\n- $\\mathcal{H}^{2}(\\partial B_{r_{1}}(a)) = 4\\pi r_{1}^2$\n- $\\mathcal{H}^{2}(\\partial B_{r_{2}}(b)) = 4\\pi r_{2}^2$\n\nSumming these gives the perimeter of $E$:\n$$\nP(E) = 4\\pi r_{1}^2 + 4\\pi r_{2}^2 = 4\\pi(r_{1}^2 + r_{2}^2)\n$$\nThis result is intuitive: the perimeter of the disjoint union of two well-behaved sets is the sum of their individual perimeters.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4\\pi(r_1^2 + r_2^2)}\n$$", "id": "3033454"}, {"introduction": "The standard perimeter treats all boundary orientations equally, which is not always suitable for applications like crystal growth or image analysis.

The gauge is $\\varphi_{2}(z) = |z|_{2}$.\n    The perimeter is $P_{\\varphi_{2}}(B_{r}(0);\\mathbb{R}^{n}) = \\int_{\\partial^{*} B_{r}(0)} \\varphi_{2}(\\nu_{E}(x)) \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(x)$.\n    The reduced boundary is the sphere $\\partial^{*} B_{r}(0) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} : |x|_{2} = r\\}$.\n    The outer unit normal at a point $x$ on the sphere is $\\nu_{E}(x) = \\frac{x}{|x|_{2}} = \\frac{x}{r}$.\n    The integrand is $\\varphi_{2}(\\nu_{E}(x)) = |\\nu_{E}(x)|_{2} = \\left|\\frac{x}{r}\\right|_{2} = \\frac{|x|_{2}}{r} = \\frac{r}{r} = 1$.\n    The perimeter integral is again the standard surface area of the boundary:\n    $$P_{\\varphi_{2}}(B_{r}(0);\\mathbb{R}^{n}) = \\int_{\\partial B_{r}(0)} 1 \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(x) = \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\\partial B_{r}(0)).$$\n    This is the surface area of the $(n-1)$-sphere of radius $r$. The surface area of the unit $(n-1)$-sphere, $\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(S^{n-1})$, is related to the volume of the $n$-dimensional unit ball $\\omega_{n}$ by the formula $\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(S^{n-1}) = n \\omega_{n}$.\n    By scaling, the surface area of a sphere of radius $r$ is $r^{n-1}$ times the surface area of the unit sphere.\n    So, $\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\\partial B_{r}(0)) = r^{n-1} \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(S^{n-1}) = n \\omega_{n} r^{n-1}$.\n    Thus, $P_{\\varphi_{2}}(B_{r}(0);\\mathbb{R}^{n}) = n \\omega_{n} r^{n-1}$.\n\n4.  **Computation of $P_{\\varphi_{1}}(B_{r}(0);\\mathbb{R}^{n})$ for a ball.**\n    The set $E$ and domain $\\Omega$ are the same as in the third part. The gauge is $\\varphi_{1}(z) = \\|z\\|_{1}$.\n    The perimeter is $P_{\\varphi_{1}}(B_{r}(0);\\mathbb{R}^{n}) = \\int_{\\partial B_{r}(0)} \\varphi_{1}(\\nu_{E}(x)) \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(x)$.\n    The boundary is $\\partial B_{r}(0)$ and the normal is $\\nu_{E}(x) = x/r$.\n    The integrand is $\\varphi_{1}(\\nu_{E}(x)) = \\|\\frac{x}{r}\\|_{1} = \\frac{1}{r} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_{i}|$.\n    The integral is:\n    $$P_{\\varphi_{1}}(B_{r}(0);\\mathbb{R}^{n}) = \\int_{\\partial B_{r}(0)} \\frac{1}{r} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_{i}| \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(x).$$\n    We perform a change of variables $x=ru$, where $u \\in S^{n-1} = \\partial B_{1}(0)$. The surface measure element scales as $d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(x) = r^{n-1} d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(u)$.\n    $$P_{\\varphi_{1}}(B_{r}(0);\\mathbb{R}^{n}) = \\int_{S^{n-1}} \\frac{1}{r} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |ru_{i}| \\, r^{n-1} d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(u) = r^{n-1} \\int_{S^{n-1}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |u_{i}| \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(u).$$\n    By symmetry of the sphere, the integral of $|u_{i}|$ is the same for any $i \\in \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$.\n    $$\\int_{S^{n-1}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |u_{i}| \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(u) = n \\int_{S^{n-1}} |u_{1}| \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(u).$$\n    We compute the integral $I = \\int_{S^{n-1}} |u_{1}| \\, d\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(u)$. We can express the integral over $S^{n-1}$ by integrating with respect to the first coordinate $t=u_1$ from $-1$ to $1$, and over the cross-sectional $(n-2)$-spheres of radius $\\sqrt{1-t^2}$.\n    $$I = \\int_{-1}^{1} |t| \\left( \\int_{S^{n-2}_{\\sqrt{1-t^2}}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-t^2}} d\\mathcal{H}^{n-2} \\right) dt,$$\n    where we used the co-area formula with the surface gradient magnitude being $\\sqrt{1-t^2}$. The inner integral is the surface area of an $(n-2)$-sphere of radius $\\sqrt{1-t^2}$, which is $\\mathcal{H}^{n-2}(S^{n-2}) (\\sqrt{1-t^2})^{n-2}$. Using $\\mathcal{H}^{n-2}(S^{n-2}) = (n-1)\\omega_{n-1}$, we get:\n    $$I = \\int_{-1}^{1} |t| \\frac{(n-1)\\omega_{n-1}(1-t^2)^{(n-2)/2}}{\\sqrt{1-t^2}} dt = (n-1)\\omega_{n-1} \\int_{-1}^{1} |t|(1-t^2)^{(n-3)/2} dt.$$\n    The integrand is even, so we can write this as:\n    $$I = 2(n-1)\\omega_{n-1} \\int_{0}^{1} t(1-t^2)^{(n-3)/2} dt.$$\n    Let $s=t^2$, so $ds = 2t dt$.\n    $$I = 2(n-1)\\omega_{n-1} \\int_{0}^{1} (1-s)^{(n-3)/2} \\frac{ds}{2} = (n-1)\\omega_{n-1} \\left[ -\\frac{(1-s)^{(n-1)/2}}{(n-1)/2} \\right]_{0}^{1}.$$\n    $$I = (n-1)\\omega_{n-1} \\left( 0 - \\left( -\\frac{1}{(n-1)/2} \\right) \\right) = (n-1)\\omega_{n-1} \\frac{2}{n-1} = 2\\omega_{n-1}.$$\n    Substituting this back into the expression for the perimeter:\n    $$P_{\\varphi_{1}}(B_{r}(0);\\mathbb{R}^{n}) = r^{n-1} \\cdot n \\cdot (2\\omega_{n-1}) = 2n\\omega_{n-1} r^{n-1}.$$\n    This completes the four computations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\omega_{n-1} R^{n-1}  \\omega_{n-1} R^{n-1}  n \\omega_{n} r^{n-1}  2 n \\omega_{n-1} r^{n-1} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3033455"}]}
